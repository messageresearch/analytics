[12:21] blessed these holy name I think we're
[12:23] when I hand over to brother James now
[12:25] and then I'm just going to unshaped and
[12:28] then I hope you're an immediate brother
[12:31] James back to you my brother over to you
[12:35] brother James fishy it's wonderful the
[12:40] output a fellowship again over Scott and
[12:43] I'm I've got a paratha maybe just more
[12:47] of a teaching sort of strong message
[12:50] tonight so I'm gonna try and take over
[12:53] the screen share and do a PowerPoint but
[12:58] it will probably stop the main image off
[13:01] all your faces or my face from coming up
[13:03] but I've played around with that are
[13:05] better that's sort of the best we can
[13:06] manage under the circumstances so we'll
[13:11] try that and you can you can unmute your
[13:13] microphones as well
[13:16] David so Oh amen
[13:20] see if I can take over this so does
[13:37] everybody have a slideshow on their
[13:41] screen let's change this little box so
[13:54] it's out of my Road all right so
[13:59] we're going to read from speaking
[14:03] Corinthians 11 chapter 18 verse 24 and
[14:12] scenes that suffer on the screen I'll
[14:14] stand up reading it up I've got quite a
[14:17] few scriptures in quite a field
[14:18] scientist carry on tonight of the Jews
[14:26] five times received by forty stripes
[14:28] save one throats I was beaten with rods
[14:31] once I was stoned thrice I suffered
[14:34] shipwreck a night in a day I have been
[14:37] in the deep and earnings often and
[14:40] perils of water and perils of robbers
[14:42] and perils by my own countrymen
[14:44] Imperials by the heathen and errol's in
[14:47] the city and perils in the wilderness
[14:49] and perils in the sea and a Errol's
[14:52] among false brethren and weariness and
[14:55] painfulness in watchings often in hunger
[14:58] and thirst and fastings often in cold
[15:02] and nakedness besides those things that
[15:06] are without that which cometh upon me
[15:08] daily the care of all the church it's
[15:11] just let's just commit these words to
[15:14] the Lord give any father we thank you
[15:17] Lord that we can just take this little
[15:19] word study tonight Lord and just ask you
[15:22] Lord to speak to us what you would want
[15:24] us to have for this time board that we
[15:26] could grow in you Lord Jesus as father a
[15:29] desire is to just grow closer to you in
[15:31] this mind father I just pray Lord you
[15:33] know take your words and then knowing my
[15:35] lips father just to stay with your word
[15:37] I ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[15:44] so my thought tonight but the tight I've
[15:48] titled this message do not attempt this
[15:51] trail if you have commitment issues
[15:56] maybe take us a little while before we
[15:58] get through this that that might make
[16:00] sense that looking here at what Paul had
[16:03] to go through he he went through great
[16:06] amount of suffering to bring forth a
[16:08] message for his age and it required a
[16:11] great sacrifice upon his life
[16:13] but through all these things that he
[16:15] suffered he never lost his vision he
[16:17] never lost his driver as burdened to
[16:19] deliver the message to the age and we've
[16:25] got to make sure we don't lose our drive
[16:26] as well we know all this plague of its
[16:30] covered 19 came about one of my first
[16:32] thoughts I had and I just asked brother
[16:35] Isaac if I was okay to just say
[16:37] something about this but I I thought you
[16:39] know it seems like the ins coming up so
[16:42] quick but I thought you know brother
[16:44] Isaac had this vision to make this movie
[16:46] that brother branham's life and he's so
[16:48] committed to it and I I really respect
[16:51] that and I believe that the vision that
[16:53] he's followings of God I thought in time
[16:55] I said to go on a bit longer but I
[16:58] thought now if he wasn't totally
[17:00] committed to that vision he could lose
[17:02] faith and say oh looks like times run
[17:04] out you know maybe I was wrong but this
[17:07] is not a time when we should be
[17:08] questioning the problem we should be
[17:11] questioning late I believe we're in a
[17:14] time where we need to take a check out
[17:16] how committed we are to this message be
[17:19] completely sold out you know Esau sold
[17:22] his birthright for a mess of pottage and
[17:25] people sell out the same today for a
[17:27] mess of this world and its riches taking
[17:30] Lessing as well as well nothing they can
[17:33] compare to what Christ offered us and
[17:36] this word committed that means to be
[17:39] pledged or bound to a certain cause or a
[17:43] certain policy dedicated when you
[17:46] accepted Christ as your Savior you
[17:48] accepted the wedding ring and you made a
[17:51] marriage commitment just before brother
[17:54] Brandon left the scene at the end of 65
[17:56] he laid out a lot of important things to
[17:58] go out after your message and I believe
[18:01] here this is me of me but I believe he
[18:03] knew he was going this way he had a
[18:05] pretty good last month and God felt it
[18:09] was important for him to preach this
[18:10] marriage soo ceremony last month so
[18:13] others ministry write down and read
[18:17] through the quote well I quote that I
[18:19] pulled out of it and I just want us to
[18:21] spiritualize it and
[18:23] glean something out of it so he says
[18:26] here in 65 wedding ceremony and we'll
[18:31] charge you both as you saw he's taking
[18:35] her wedding making places and we charge
[18:38] you both as you will surely answer the
[18:41] day of judgment secrets of all hearts
[18:43] shall be disclosed that if either if you
[18:46] know any impediment why you should not
[18:49] be lawfully joined together on this holy
[18:51] merit mony
[18:52] do you now confess it for bearded short
[18:55] unto you there any person that could
[18:58] have joined otherwise then God's Word
[19:00] does allow the marriage is not lawful
[19:03] but believing that you have Julie
[19:05] considered the solemn obligation that
[19:07] you're about to assume that you have
[19:10] prepared to enter upon the same
[19:12] reverently discreetly wisely and in the
[19:15] fear of God I shall purpose to you this
[19:18] marriage covenant you will declare the
[19:20] same as you join your right hands the
[19:23] groom and the bride row in the right
[19:24] hands together will you take this woman
[19:27] to be your lawfully wedded wife I've
[19:30] just added this here in the red I
[19:32] believe this I can say that this is
[19:34] Christ speaking to the bride as marriage
[19:36] vows will you take this woman to be your
[19:38] lawfully wedded wife to live together in
[19:40] this holy state of matrimony do you
[19:43] promise to love honor and cherish and
[19:45] sickness and health and riches and
[19:47] poverty and will forsake all others and
[19:50] cleave to thee and cleave the only unto
[19:53] her as long as you both love the groom
[19:55] answer as I will not take this man to be
[20:00] your lawfully wedded husband to live in
[20:02] this holy matrimony do you promise to
[20:04] love honor cherish in sickness and
[20:06] health and riches and poverty and will
[20:10] forsake all others and cleave thee only
[20:12] unto him as long as you both live the
[20:15] bride answers I will obey I will require
[20:19] a token of you that is Covenant betwixt
[20:21] you there that's been made will always
[20:25] be kept two rings a place on the
[20:27] minister's Bible then offered to the
[20:29] groom for the bride then to the bride
[20:31] for the groom now will you join your
[20:33] right hands together upon the
[20:34] of God so now there has to be a token to
[20:39] seal this marriage but so often we make
[20:43] it each to Christ but we don't follow
[20:45] through with our bowels so when you come
[20:48] and say well I've committed my life to
[20:50] God but there has to be something
[20:52] outwardly that shows that you've made
[20:54] that commitment and it's tradition
[20:58] through many religions that after the
[21:01] couple were joined together in this and
[21:03] this wedding ceremony that the first
[21:06] thing they do is they go to the wedding
[21:07] chamber to consummate the marriage and
[21:09] in doing this the bride proves that she
[21:12] was a virgin to her husband and displays
[21:15] the blood on the beating she did it
[21:16] that's the token that the marriage has
[21:19] been sealed
[21:19] now the token on display is the proof
[21:22] the marriage has taken place this has to
[21:25] happen before the bride and groom go
[21:27] away on the honeymoon and now the bride
[21:30] is pregnant with the life of her husband
[21:32] so if your marriage has been consummated
[21:34] and the blood is on display you have the
[21:37] life of God on display to this world so
[21:42] I'm go to Deuteronomy 22 and just bring
[21:45] this up first thirteen If any man take a
[21:50] wife and go and unto her and hate her
[21:53] and give occasion of speech against her
[21:55] and bring up an evil name upon her and
[21:58] say I took this woman and when I came to
[22:00] her I found her not a maid then shall
[22:03] the father of the damsel and her mother
[22:05] take and bring forth the tokens of the
[22:07] damsels virginity and to the elders of
[22:09] the city and the gate and the damsels
[22:11] father shall say unto the elders I gave
[22:13] my daughter to this man to wife and he
[22:16] hated it and lo he giveth occassional
[22:19] speech against her saying I found not
[22:21] their daughter a maid and yet these are
[22:23] the tokens of my daughter's virginity
[22:25] and they shall spread the cloth before
[22:28] the elders of the city and the elders of
[22:30] that City shall take the men and
[22:32] chastise them and they show Amerson at
[22:34] hundred shekels of silver and gift them
[22:37] unto the father of the damsel because he
[22:40] has wrought an evil name upon a virgin
[22:41] of Israel and she shall be his wife and
[22:44] he may not put her away all those days
[22:47] so your token
[22:48] as powerful there's nothing that can
[22:51] separate you once your marriage to
[22:53] Christ as being consummated so don't
[22:56] listen to the devil if he tells you God
[22:58] don't love you your Union is bound upon
[23:01] the laws of God and they do not change
[23:03] and they cannot be broken when brother
[23:07] Brennan thought he was losing all he
[23:09] ever loved his wife had TB and was dying
[23:12] well had just died and his daughter had
[23:14] meningitis and was laying there about to
[23:17] die his dying baby in his arms he said
[23:21] the devil came alongside him and said
[23:23] God don't love you he hates you
[23:25] like he's taking your wife taking her
[23:27] baby and the devil was trying to make
[23:29] him doubt that God ever loved them but
[23:32] brother Branham said boo devil I'll say
[23:34] as job said though you slay me yet will
[23:36] I love you Lord Jesus no he said with
[23:40] great loss God never lived them but the
[23:43] devil was so quick to step in and make
[23:45] you doubt your token in times of
[23:47] calamity but there's nothing that can
[23:50] take that off you once that marriage is
[23:52] consummated he may not put you away all
[23:55] his days but don't be a foolish virgin
[23:59] because there will be a people that call
[24:00] themselves bride they claim to have the
[24:03] token but they failed the virginity test
[24:05] so scripture carries on and reader honor
[24:08] me but if this thing be true and the
[24:11] token of the virginity be found not for
[24:13] the damsel then they shall bring out the
[24:16] damsel to the floor of her father's
[24:17] house and the men of the city shall
[24:20] stone him with stones that she died
[24:22] because she hath wrought folly in Israel
[24:24] to play the in her father's house
[24:26] so shalt thou put evil away for the
[24:28] monkey so God's not playing he's not
[24:32] playing this people that are going in a
[24:34] rapture and there's people that are
[24:36] going to die in a tribulation and the
[24:39] plagues that are going to come are going
[24:41] to make the scope of xix look like a
[24:43] runny nose is far greater things than
[24:45] this coming this is just a woman I feel
[24:48] that this is time to do a little
[24:50] inspection now have a bit of a check
[24:52] make sure that you've got the blood
[24:54] applied in your life stranger to you if
[24:59] you want the death angel to pass over
[25:00] you this blood needs
[25:02] be on display on the door post and
[25:04] lintels and now I'm not talking about
[25:07] the house you love them you know there
[25:09] are there are believers that can't stay
[25:12] confined in the house they have to go to
[25:13] work so I'm not talking about the blood
[25:16] on the doorpost of the house but I'm
[25:17] talking about the blood on display upon
[25:20] your Tabernacle your body your earthly
[25:22] dwelling being man that's right there's
[25:25] a work to be done in this time and it's
[25:27] a rework of the Holy Spirit there's a
[25:29] reprocessing and if we're to be the
[25:32] final voice of the final generation then
[25:34] the Holy Spirit will move again through
[25:37] the bride like he did through the
[25:38] Prophet the same month of God moving
[25:41] again through the life that's been
[25:43] conceived than the bride and then so
[25:48] here in choosing of the bride pining 65
[25:52] notice just a minute a minute a nun and
[25:55] a Catholic Church that woman to become a
[25:58] nun and takes the last veil she has
[26:01] absolutely sold out to that church she
[26:04] is soul body and spirit property of that
[26:07] church she has no mind of her own
[26:10] she can't have when she takes that last
[26:13] veil no mind of her own
[26:14] no will of her own see out here Satan
[26:17] makes them has bogus like the truth the
[26:21] true Church of Christ the bride is so
[26:24] sold out to him and as promised we're
[26:26] till the very mind that's in crisis in
[26:28] you amen what a difference over and we
[26:31] flattened a that the modern church the
[26:34] modern world Church the modern world
[26:37] Church and also the spiritual church at
[26:39] both pregnat to give birth to sons
[26:43] that's right one of them a
[26:45] denominational birth is going together
[26:47] for one day these things at the World
[26:49] Council of Churches which will produced
[26:52] to the world the Antichrist through a
[26:54] denomination that's exactly the truth I
[26:57] may not love to see it I believe I will
[27:00] but you young people remember that you
[27:02] heard a minister say that that'll
[27:05] finally wind out and that is the mark of
[27:08] the beast when she forms their World
[27:10] Council of Churches and she'll give
[27:13] birth to his son Antichrist
[27:15] yeah the other is pregnant by the word
[27:18] of God and will bring forth the body of
[27:20] the finished body of the Lord of Jesus
[27:22] Christ which is that right here minute
[27:24] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[27:27] how many knows that a man and woman is
[27:29] one in Christ as one body the word the
[27:32] bride will have to be the rest of that
[27:34] body and the two together makes the body
[27:37] again one body again like Adam that was
[27:39] at the beginning man man has wife at one
[27:43] now she the true bride so sold out to
[27:46] him that she used no mind of her life of
[27:49] her own as mind of course as has well
[27:52] and has well as his word so now we have
[27:56] to put this into action and so we know
[28:00] the scripture but we'll read over it
[28:01] again in Revelation 10 verse 8 and the
[28:05] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[28:07] unto me again and said go and take the
[28:10] little book which is open in the hand of
[28:12] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[28:14] and upon the earth and I went unto the
[28:16] angel and said unto him give me the
[28:19] little book man and he said unto me take
[28:21] it and eat it up and it shall make thy
[28:23] belly better that it shall be and thy
[28:25] mouth sweet as hanging Angels hand and
[28:30] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[28:32] as honey and as soon as I had eaten that
[28:34] my belly was better and he said unto me
[28:37] thou must prophesy again will for many
[28:40] peoples and nations and tongues and
[28:42] camps yeah this is the commission to the
[28:45] bride not the profit for the age not for
[28:49] a return ministry but for those - he who
[28:52] has an ear I hear what the spirit saith
[28:54] to the church
[28:55] Jhansi give me the book we didn't sit
[28:59] around and wait for something to happen
[29:01] he acted a sway the Amanda or here in
[29:05] the prophets last month the spirit wants
[29:08] us to catch something a lot of these
[29:09] quotes I'm going to a right at the end
[29:11] of 65 on the winds of a snow white dove
[29:16] hmm and I don't want you to focus on on
[29:20] the song as much but just the context of
[29:23] what he's saying because this is what's
[29:25] what I've really been looking at lately
[29:26] on the wings of a snow
[29:28] white dove God seems down his pure sweet
[29:31] love a sign from above on the wings of a
[29:34] dove why me and old men suffered all my
[29:38] life why did he heal me now
[29:40] see I believe at the stage he knew he
[29:42] was going to be leaving the scene why
[29:44] did he heal me now I believe I'll ride
[29:47] this trail again I got to bring a
[29:49] message and I say to my father tonight
[29:53] there's jr. seen in a dream the other
[29:54] night of the winds of the stuff and I
[29:58] just say here the Spirit coming down on
[30:00] the people moving in the windows here
[30:02] Lord your servant reporting for service
[30:04] Amen I'm ready
[30:06] on the winds of the snow white dove God
[30:08] sends me his pure sweet love a sign from
[30:12] above on the wings of a dove let's
[30:15] believe now that he's moving upon the
[30:17] audience on the wings of US Office know
[30:20] what we're waiting Lord God scenes down
[30:23] his pure sweet love a sign from above on
[30:25] the wings of a dove I just want to go
[30:29] over there tasty where did I go I
[30:34] believe I'll ride this trail again I've
[30:37] got to bring a message and I say to my
[30:40] father tonight as junior seen in a dream
[30:42] the other night on the wings of the
[30:46] staff moving in the windows here Lord
[30:48] your servants reporting for service amen
[30:51] I'm ready on the winds of a snow-white
[30:53] death it was ready to go and and ride
[30:57] this trail again
[30:58] and I believe that this is the angel
[31:00] speaking through the prophet reporting
[31:03] for service I'm ready to ride this trail
[31:05] again it's a spirit moving through the
[31:07] Prophet because this message did have to
[31:11] be prophesied again but it's not coming
[31:13] through a return ministry at brother
[31:15] Brennan it's coming through the bride a
[31:19] man here in 1961 Mary's belief we are
[31:25] looking for a heavenly visitor in this
[31:27] day it's a promise of God put on your
[31:30] deep spiritual thinking quit Church and
[31:32] remember we are now looking for a
[31:34] visitor and there are many claiming it
[31:36] but the only way that we'll know this
[31:38] heavenly visitor
[31:39] because he'll be a record off the word
[31:42] she knew that the angel was from God
[31:45] when she seen his action look to them
[31:48] and must have it must be an angel he
[31:51] said I am Gabriel standing at the right
[31:53] hand of God now when God gets ready to
[31:56] do something he sends a messenger always
[31:59] always has always will
[32:01] Gabriel announced the first coming of
[32:04] Christ Gabriel will announce the second
[32:06] coming of Christ
[32:07] that's right something major is fixing
[32:09] to heaven and I just want to talk about
[32:13] this a little better and if it's a puppy
[32:16] just spit it out of it so it's talking
[32:19] here about Gabriel and Archangel and
[32:21] really Gabriel's an attribute of God
[32:25] being expressed he's seen forth with a
[32:27] message of declaration and I want to say
[32:30] like this just before Abraham and Sarah
[32:33] had the body change they had one last
[32:36] sign God manifesting and flesh standing
[32:39] before them amen thoughts of their heart
[32:42] and many times brother Brennan picked us
[32:45] up and pointed it at his ministry he was
[32:48] standing on the platform every night
[32:49] revealing the thoughts of the heart a
[32:51] last sign before the body change
[32:54] then who was brother Branham was he a
[32:56] man or was it God well because we know
[33:00] brother Brennan was just a man we know
[33:02] where he's at we know a dove descended
[33:04] upon his cabin at his birth spirit
[33:07] coming down to you know who his parents
[33:09] was yet he said this is the last sign
[33:12] God manifested on flesh before you
[33:15] revealing your throat revealing your
[33:17] thoughts yeah and brother Brennan was
[33:20] out hunting with Dawson Riley and
[33:22] brother Dawson septum rather Branum some
[33:25] people say that you were Jesus Christ
[33:27] and brother Brennan responded and said
[33:30] well that's not far from the truth
[33:32] because it's God displaying himself
[33:34] through a veil it's just brother Brennan
[33:38] got the spirit through him as displaying
[33:41] God the same way he did with brother
[33:43] Brennan the same way he did through now
[33:46] kisser dick through Michael through
[33:48] Gabriel it was written that he himself
[33:51] shall descend
[33:53] with a shout voice and a Trump he will
[33:56] present this church to himself that's
[33:59] all God manifesting himself and the
[34:03] bride and the last day is God
[34:06] manifesting himself to the world but the
[34:10] Prophet had to have the spirit of Elijah
[34:12] to have boldness to step out and call
[34:14] son son and to call out Jesus and a head
[34:18] you know if only JFK knew that he was a
[34:21] head in the Bible he might have drive
[34:22] around in a bulletproof car because it
[34:27] was already prophesied what was going to
[34:28] happen to him but yet brother Branham
[34:31] had the Holy Spirit as well that brought
[34:33] grace and mercy then what about the
[34:36] angel of the Lord that stood on the
[34:38] platform who was he
[34:40] see God is omnipotent he can speak
[34:44] through the mouth of a donkey he's
[34:46] omnipresent he's not limited the only
[34:49] one office at a time yes so when an
[34:52] announcement comes forth Gabriel steeps
[34:55] forth brother Brennan was preaching and
[34:57] Daniel seventy weeks
[34:59] he said Gabriel blows the foreigner'
[35:02] trumpet as the bride's being raptured
[35:03] and the gospels going back to the Jews
[35:05] well Abrial announced price to the
[35:08] jurors at his first coming christ was
[35:10] rejected and he turned to the Gentiles
[35:13] then at the second coming Gabriel again
[35:16] declares this message back to the Jews
[35:18] for the completion of the second camp so
[35:22] God coming back on the wings of a snow
[35:24] white dove to ride this trail again to
[35:27] continue this message through the bride
[35:29] but Jesus on display again before this
[35:33] council of churches that is forming now
[35:35] before our eyes when you come to your
[35:39] maturity and speak this word of God as
[35:41] it's been revealed you become an earthly
[35:45] an earthly angel messenger so as this
[35:48] thing before and brother Brennan was
[35:49] preaching and he was someone had asked
[35:52] him a question about the angel of the
[35:53] Lord and he said he was saying I can
[35:58] only assume that he was pointing to
[36:00] ministers that were around him you are
[36:02] saying let me show you here is an
[36:03] earthly messenger and here's an earthly
[36:06] messenger
[36:06] here's an earthly messenger because when
[36:09] a man picks up the Word of God and its
[36:12] fullness and speaks the word for the age
[36:16] and it's truth that is a messenger to
[36:18] the age and if we must finish the work
[36:25] that Jesus did not complete in his
[36:27] earthly ministry which is to preach to
[36:30] the total loss and a handless message
[36:33] back to his own people that were blinded
[36:35] for our sake so now on the pergamene
[36:40] church age those and the bride do only
[36:44] as well no one can make them do
[36:47] otherwise they have thus saith the Lord
[36:50] or they keep still even they know that
[36:53] it has to be God and them doing the
[36:55] works other than its own word he did not
[36:59] complete all his work guellen as earthly
[37:01] ministry so now he works in and through
[37:04] the bride
[37:05] she knows therefore it was not yet time
[37:08] for him to do certain things that he
[37:10] must not do now but now will he fulfill
[37:14] through the bride that work which he
[37:16] left for this specific time when when
[37:21] Ruth was redeemed by Boaz there was a
[37:24] marriage the marriage was consummated
[37:26] and she gave birth to a son and as the
[37:29] bride has today given birth to to the
[37:33] Lord Jesus Christ to manifest him then
[37:38] Ruth handed that baby back to Naomi that
[37:41] is reliable go to the next slide here a
[37:44] revelation of Jesus Christ now when this
[37:47] go now when as the gospel returning to
[37:51] the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is
[37:54] finished the gospel is ready to go back
[37:57] to the Jews oh if I could just tell you
[37:59] something that is about to happen right
[38:01] in this day this grappling that is about
[38:03] to happen will carry over to revelation
[38:06] 11 and pick up those two witnesses those
[38:09] two prophets Moses and Elijah turning
[38:12] the gospel back to the juries we're
[38:13] ready for it everything is in order
[38:15] as the Jews brought the message to the
[38:18] Gentiles even so the June
[38:20] we'll take it right back to the Jews and
[38:22] the rapture come I read and hear and
[38:27] gods only provide a place of worship and
[38:30] just remember from the West will come a
[38:32] white horse rider will ride this trail
[38:35] again that's right soon as we're ready
[38:37] I'll promise it's a promise you see so
[38:41] the gospel came from the east and as a
[38:44] mature that when as far west as it could
[38:47] go and then brother Branham had this
[38:49] burden in his heart his whole life
[38:51] growing up as a boy to go west
[38:53] he had to complete the revealing of all
[38:56] the mysteries that were written in the
[38:57] book as all the mysteries had to be
[38:59] finished in this day and he says now
[39:02] remember from the West will come this
[39:04] white horse rider same Holy Spirit that
[39:07] was on the prophet and full maturity
[39:09] coming back again from the West to take
[39:12] the gospel back to the Jews where it
[39:14] will be accepted how will this exactly
[39:17] happen I don't exactly know that I can
[39:20] say we're mighty close to that day I
[39:22] remember when brother Brandon was in
[39:25] Egypt and he was ready to go and take
[39:27] this message to the Jews yeah an angel
[39:29] stopped them and said the time of the
[39:32] Gentiles is not yet full in we know when
[39:36] he preached Souls imprison now that we
[39:39] would come into a time before the
[39:40] rapture at the time of Gentiles is over
[39:43] and this message would be preached to
[39:45] the total loss that was a part of the
[39:47] third pole and the angels stopped
[39:51] brother branham from going into Israel
[39:52] because the Jews are taught to believe
[39:54] the prophets when they show the sign of
[39:57] a prophet
[39:58] so if he'd have entered into their land
[40:00] with this gift on display the Jews would
[40:03] have accepted it but it wasn't it wasn't
[40:06] their time and there are message
[40:08] believers now in the Holy Land living
[40:10] there what's going to happen when they
[40:12] come to full maturity silver and gold
[40:15] have I none but what I have given to you
[40:17] arise they kept thy bed and walk
[40:19] that same sign is prophesized to come
[40:22] across upon the bride again and the
[40:24] squeeze by never before so how close are
[40:28] we to the culmination of all this
[40:30] brothers you're living in that day
[40:32] you're
[40:33] then major a public event and it's so
[40:37] easy to read the Bible and read about
[40:39] Noah and read about Moses and Elijah and
[40:43] so on but what about you because just
[40:46] read yourself in Revelation 10 8 to 11
[40:49] that's you you made a major part in the
[40:52] fulfilling of this whole reading book
[40:54] that's right
[40:56] Nora well I want to take the snap man to
[40:58] NIC level
[40:59] and the spirit is too clear I'll write
[41:02] this trail again and my thought was do
[41:07] not attend this trail have you had
[41:09] commitment issues I believe we're going
[41:12] to have to step up our game step up our
[41:14] confidence and James 2 verse 20 but will
[41:21] but will they'll know oh they men that
[41:24] faith without works is dead
[41:26] that's Abraham our Father justified by
[41:30] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[41:32] upon older see thou how faith wrought
[41:35] has works and by works was faith made
[41:39] perfect
[41:40] now this perfect means complete that is
[41:45] to accomplish to consummate to
[41:47] consecrate to finish to fulfill to be
[41:50] made perfect and we're gonna practice
[41:54] this word perfect that later in another
[41:56] scripture in another meaning and goes on
[42:00] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[42:02] saith abraham believed God and it was
[42:04] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[42:07] he was called the friend of God he see
[42:10] then how that by works a man is
[42:12] justified and not by faith only likewise
[42:16] also was not Rahab the harlot justified
[42:18] by works when she had received the
[42:21] messengers and had sent them out another
[42:23] way but as the body without the Spirit
[42:26] is dead so faith without works is dead
[42:29] also so I say do not attempt this trail
[42:35] of you have commitment issues and this
[42:38] statement really come from my mountain
[42:40] biking
[42:42] yes because mountain biking takes a
[42:48] total commitment there's quite a few
[42:51] apps where you can read about the trail
[42:53] that you're about to go down and when
[42:55] you start going down harder trails you
[42:57] quite often read someone who'll come in
[42:59] and they'll say do not attempt this
[43:02] trail if you have commitment issues
[43:03] because you're gonna crash and you're
[43:05] gonna burn because suddenly you're going
[43:08] to find yourself in an unfamiliar
[43:09] situation and you become like a stone
[43:12] mallet because you know fear grows and
[43:15] you get you forget all of that training
[43:17] that you've had and what happens is you
[43:20] take your eyes off the trail and start
[43:22] to look at the obstacle and you end up
[43:24] looking your hand up appealing straight
[43:26] in the direction you're looking I can
[43:27] guarantee you and you're flying down
[43:29] that track and a tree sort of pops out
[43:32] of the side of the track level but if
[43:33] you keep looking at that tree you're
[43:35] gonna end up giving a real big hug and
[43:37] it's nice you've got to keep your eyes
[43:40] on Jesus because once we start going
[43:42] down this road once this over 19
[43:45] disappears and the next play comes
[43:47] that's not going to be an easier play
[43:50] it's gonna be harder maybe this will
[43:53] bring on the real tightening of the
[43:55] squeeze where these council of churches
[43:57] won't let us have meetings akin maybe
[43:59] we'll never have a meeting again who
[44:01] knows things are going to start to get
[44:03] tough and you're gonna have to start
[44:05] walking on your own and then your staff
[44:10] you're gonna have to lead your family to
[44:13] keep your eyes on the direction you want
[44:15] to go once you're on this trail and
[44:18] there's no point in you even were
[44:20] walking this trail while riding this
[44:22] trail and if you've got commitment
[44:24] issues get committed to Christ first
[44:26] even had the same things while hunting
[44:30] and you find yourself in an
[44:32] uncomfortable place where sudden you've
[44:34] been looking at where you want to go and
[44:36] you get so far and you get bluffed
[44:39] that's quite often a term where you see
[44:41] you've tried to drop down into a valley
[44:44] and as you go and you're thinking
[44:45] constantly I'm not going to be able to
[44:47] go that back the same way that I can
[44:49] there's no way I can turn back and you
[44:52] know Lot's wife turned back once and she
[44:53] turned to a pillar of salt
[44:55] the
[44:55] there's no way you can go back you have
[44:57] to keep pressing forward and it's going
[44:59] to take faith because sometimes when
[45:02] you're going down there for that hunt
[45:04] and you hit having to move to the next
[45:05] spot there was one time I started
[45:08] climbing around the edge of a bluff
[45:09] because I had no other way out and the
[45:11] bluff started getting steeper and
[45:13] narrower and the rocks were falling and
[45:16] I had a 20 20 odd kg pack on my back and
[45:19] it was a really scary situation I
[45:22] thought if I have one little slip I'm
[45:25] going to die in this situation and
[45:27] sometimes and you know I think as we go
[45:30] on in this journey we might find
[45:33] ourselves in a situation where we really
[45:36] get pressed up when you say Lord I don't
[45:38] know what to do but you have to have
[45:40] faith you have to get faith and say the
[45:44] Lord as a ministry just commit for it
[45:49] you've got a guy got a nosey take it off
[45:53] no Parab how can take their token off
[45:56] you you're bound to it Laurie what are
[46:00] you gonna do you just you can't go back
[46:01] so what are you just gonna stay there
[46:03] and give up it's going to take a total
[46:06] commitment
[46:07] a commitment to what you believe you
[46:11] know I'm not talking about
[46:12] and when I say commitment I'm not
[46:14] talking about your church attendance
[46:16] yeah that's basic that smoke I'm talking
[46:19] about
[46:19] totally sold out to what you believe
[46:24] committed to what you've been taught as
[46:27] you will see the supernatural before
[46:29] your eyes as a message believer I
[46:32] believe there are promises that have
[46:33] been made for the bride and we enter
[46:39] away to Jesus there's coming there is
[46:43] coming a time upon in this nation to
[46:46] where this nation is going to exercise
[46:48] all the power the Beast had before it
[46:50] and egg in Rome when it became papal
[46:53] Rome see that this nation will do that
[46:56] revelation 13 plainly explains them the
[47:00] lamb come up out of the earth of the
[47:02] other beasts come up out of the water
[47:04] thickness and multitudes of people this
[47:07] land come up where they were no pea
[47:09] a lamb represents a religion the Lamb of
[47:12] God and remember at spake like a lamb it
[47:15] was a lamb and then after a while that
[47:19] received power and spoke like a dragon
[47:22] and yes biased all the dragon power
[47:25] the dragon had before him and the dragon
[47:28] is Rome always so don't you see Roman
[47:31] denomination a mark Protestant
[47:33] denomination and image to the Beast
[47:36] making a power that will force all
[47:38] Protestants like a union you'll have to
[47:41] be in this Council of Churches or you
[47:43] won't be able to have fellowship or well
[47:46] it's practically that way now you can't
[47:48] go to church and preach unless you have
[47:50] a fellowship card or some identification
[47:52] and now on persons like ourselves we're
[47:55] going to be cut out of all that
[47:57] altogether that's exactly because they
[48:00] won't be able to do it as tightening and
[48:03] then when that time comes and the priest
[48:06] comes to a place where you're pressed
[48:08] out then watch what I'm flexing to tell
[48:10] you in a few minutes watch the third
[48:13] pull then see and it'll absolutely be it
[48:16] and it will be absolutely to the total
[48:18] loss and a but it will be for the bride
[48:22] and the church so SS squeeze comes on
[48:26] and you're being pressed out then watch
[48:29] the third pull then but we're limited by
[48:32] our own faith to believe and as we see
[48:36] prophecy happening around us as rising
[48:38] up faith then what happens when it gets
[48:42] down to the wire and you have no food
[48:44] and you have no water because the power
[48:46] companies shut down and the pump station
[48:48] is out of action then what there's no
[48:51] medicine supply medics are overwhelmed
[48:54] and the doctors are sick themselves
[48:56] something has to happen to manifest the
[48:59] power of God amen
[49:02] Laurie and John 14 verse 12 says fairly
[49:10] fairly I say unto you he that believeth
[49:12] on me the works that I do shall he do
[49:16] also and greater works than these shall
[49:18] he do because I go unto my father
[49:22] and here in Shillong 1964 and there is a
[49:26] light of the hour today there Jesus
[49:28] Christ and the power of his resurrection
[49:31] has word their promise for this day the
[49:34] works that I do shall you also greater
[49:38] than these shall you do before I go to
[49:40] the Father greater works greater things
[49:43] than he did do you believe it then I
[49:46] mean believe it
[49:48] it seems humble it seems like it goes
[49:50] over the top of people's head huh look
[49:53] when he was here on earth how could you
[49:56] do greater words I've translated that
[50:00] many times more but the same thing so
[50:04] and and the past he's been teaching that
[50:06] I mean that mean the same things but
[50:09] more of the same things but now he's
[50:11] correcting his teaching here to show
[50:13] something else greater he said in Saint
[50:15] John 14:12 greater works than these
[50:18] shall you do did you notice when he went
[50:22] when he went to make water into wine he
[50:25] took water first and already created
[50:28] substance and turned it into the wine
[50:30] when he fed 5,000 he took a fish that
[50:33] once swam in the water broke it handed
[50:36] out and multiplied creation he took
[50:39] bread that was once we baked into bread
[50:42] broke it and hung it out to the hand to
[50:45] hand it out to the people and return
[50:47] back again multiplied creation but in
[50:51] the last day where there is no sign of
[50:53] creation he speaks into creation anyhow
[50:56] shows to be the same God that was in the
[50:59] beginning he can create squirrels he can
[51:02] create whatever he wants to because he
[51:04] is God greater things than this will you
[51:07] do for I go unto my father the word is
[51:10] available and it has to be manifest and
[51:12] it has to be fulfilled yeah irrational
[51:16] you do not multiply but speaking into
[51:19] creation amen amen
[51:21] Laura the faith for that right now and
[51:26] maybe you don't but wait till you really
[51:28] get pressed out wait as this thing
[51:31] really tightens up then you're gonna see
[51:33] some things being squeezed out of the
[51:35] bride
[51:36] you haven't seen before that's what you
[51:38] see we so commensal message absolutely
[51:43] sold out that this is the truth they use
[51:45] that man with no fear in that day and
[51:47] say I have no need to worry for tomorrow
[51:50] God shall supply my need amen and that
[51:54] faith will require action not just
[51:57] saying I believe it there is you to act
[52:00] and step out of faith well when when
[52:02] you're there and you have need and you
[52:04] can't have fellowship with the other
[52:06] believers and you can't ring up the
[52:07] pastor and say pray for me I'm hungry or
[52:10] it's going to require you to take action
[52:12] yes why it's so important now that you
[52:15] make preparations because there may not
[52:17] be anybody there to help you and you're
[52:18] gonna have to walk on your own all right
[52:21] - wait see here later Jesus still and so
[52:29] now he's talking about when he spoke to
[52:31] the storm and up on the mountain that
[52:33] day I said now we know now we're not
[52:36] first little rain starts or anything
[52:38] take for the can I said within 10 or 15
[52:41] minutes you can't see your hands before
[52:44] you when they're blizzards and it'll
[52:46] dump 20 foot of snow and a little bit
[52:48] over the mountain and that's how people
[52:50] you read and the papers how they're back
[52:53] there and perish and everything but we
[52:56] know how to get out and they knowed
[52:57] where we was at so we felt led to stay
[53:00] and so up on the mountain when that
[53:02] Blizzard started I started going down
[53:04] and I was just about half a mile away
[53:06] from where I started and the voice of
[53:08] God said turn and go back and I went
[53:12] back as he told me after waiting for a
[53:14] while and eating their sandwich that
[53:16] David gave me and went back up there and
[53:18] sat down and while I was sitting there
[53:21] and that when twisting and blowing the
[53:24] treetops leaning way over and the sleet
[53:28] and snow flying like that a voice said I
[53:31] am the God of creation I looked up and
[53:35] thought where was that that was the one
[53:39] maybe he said I created heavens and
[53:42] earth
[53:42] I stole the mighty winds upon the Seas I
[53:45] went on talking I jumped up and took off
[53:48] my head
[53:49] any sin just speak to the storm and it
[53:52] will cease what do you say that's what
[53:54] will happen
[53:55] and I said storm you cease and Sun you
[53:59] shine normally for four days till we're
[54:01] out of here and I know more than sit
[54:04] there until the sleet the snow
[54:06] everything stopped in a moment or two Oh
[54:08] hallelujah Sun was shining on my back
[54:14] you have to speak an air of me you can't
[54:17] rely on anybody else
[54:18] hmm you have to take the book do you
[54:21] have to eat the book yeah don't rely on
[54:24] the pastor don't rely on the deacon you
[54:27] speak over if you notice in there though
[54:30] brother Brennan was prompted of God to
[54:32] speak and maybe some of you have stepped
[54:35] out before and spoken the name of the
[54:37] Lord and it doesn't happen and maybe it
[54:39] was slightly out of season but don't be
[54:42] discouraged by that as that's going to
[54:45] happen that has to happen amen speak you
[54:49] speak No you realize the power that
[54:55] travels on your words when you speak
[54:57] when you're moved by the Holy Spirit to
[54:59] speak very very powerful but you can me
[55:05] in church age there it is here's the
[55:08] spirit and here's the life that's
[55:11] exactly what the word is that is exactly
[55:14] what Jesus is he is the word so when a
[55:17] spirit born spirit filled man and faith
[55:21] takes that word into his heart and
[55:23] places it upon his lip why that is the
[55:25] same as deity speaking that's right the
[55:29] other mountain has to go say to me and
[55:35] this is when faith becomes perfect
[55:38] complete concentrated to the fulfillment
[55:42] and you speak in the devil trembles at
[55:44] your voice amen
[55:46] demons tremble when you speak as you
[55:48] have more power over than when you come
[55:50] to your maturity but you make
[55:53] preparations now make your commitment
[55:55] knowing when you feel you speak and and
[55:59] what you say God will perform
[56:03] remember though it's not it's not your
[56:06] power that will create there's God's
[56:09] power that you have authority to use
[56:11] yeah and to use that you have to be
[56:14] connected with him so he makes a
[56:18] covenant with you and then you speak
[56:21] consider the natural man he's a many
[56:24] many creator that sona's nature passed
[56:27] down from Adam a man will buy a house
[56:30] and he'll take that property and he'll
[56:33] begin to create his own little mini Eden
[56:35] through his own creative power but he's
[56:38] limited to the natural he can only he
[56:43] can't do the supernatural but yet he has
[56:45] and his nature this creator he wants to
[56:48] make it as own little paradise as only
[56:50] leader yeah men can have a vision say to
[56:53] create light and in the beginning maybe
[56:57] the first light man made a fire and then
[57:00] after that a candle and then after that
[57:02] a light bulb and then an LED see
[57:05] consistently evolved but that's natural
[57:07] the God has made a covenant with you to
[57:10] do the supernatural you don't need an
[57:14] LED there's a man here who can turn on
[57:16] the lights the Lord we're going to have
[57:20] creative power
[57:25] atmosphere don't fear John don't fear
[57:30] little flock all that I am you were here
[57:34] too we are my power is yours make my own
[57:38] appearance is yours as I stand in your
[57:41] mess I have not come to bring fear and
[57:44] fail but love encourage inability
[57:48] alright it's given unto me and it is
[57:50] yours to use amen click the word and I
[57:54] will perform it my covenant and it can
[57:57] never fail Halle Laurie can get so they
[58:05] can get so full of themselves that they
[58:06] think that they can just step out and do
[58:09] whatever they want but yet they don't
[58:11] have the character and having power
[58:13] without character say Tana
[58:16] make sure that we first get the
[58:18] character through you know brother Brown
[58:25] said if you you don't have the right
[58:27] character you'll just speaker you'll
[58:29] speak your own little island into
[58:31] existence and go and live on it
[58:32] he said if you speak to this mountain
[58:36] and tell the mountain to move and you
[58:38] don't have the right character and then
[58:40] mount on the base you and it kills a
[58:42] thousand people on the other side of the
[58:43] mountain first you have to have the
[58:46] character and then he'll come in behind
[58:48] there and back it up and what and it
[58:52] will not fail amen the Covenant that's
[58:55] that blood token mm-hmm hallelujah
[58:59] thank you made it with you and it cannot
[59:02] fail if you had that blood on display
[59:05] that blood will never fail you either
[59:11] you know when I go out on the mountain
[59:13] bike to ride these trails especially
[59:16] when I go on the hard ones I like to
[59:17] know that I'm protected so when I
[59:20] started getting a bit more into it I I
[59:21] thought I really need to go and get some
[59:23] body armor so well I want to get good
[59:26] armor till I don't want to just get
[59:28] stuff that's not gonna work when I get
[59:30] into a sticky situation I want to know
[59:31] that I've protected myself with armor
[59:34] that works so I search out what armor I
[59:37] need what protection do I need and so I
[59:40] paired up my knees and I paired up my
[59:42] elbows and I put on a full face helmet
[59:44] because there's going to be a few knocks
[59:46] along the way but as long as I have put
[59:49] on that armor I know I'm protected well
[59:52] believe us been given his armor also and
[59:55] it's time to put it on because alou you
[59:58] you're gonna ride this trail we're gonna
[1:00:00] charge down together you know and you're
[1:00:02] gonna have to have this armor on because
[1:00:04] it might get messy along the way and
[1:00:06] counter some things that you're not
[1:00:08] expecting maybe there's gonna be some
[1:00:10] big rocks on the trail that you have to
[1:00:12] get it over or around you hadn't pre you
[1:00:16] hadn't premeditated that this was going
[1:00:18] to be a challenge premeditated that
[1:00:21] someone was going to come into your home
[1:00:23] and arrest you for material that you
[1:00:25] were watching online well whatever the
[1:00:27] trial is and you're going to have to
[1:00:29] have
[1:00:29] body armor on ready knowing he not a
[1:00:31] handle on that day but you can have on
[1:00:37] all this armor and it still not be
[1:00:40] enough to protect you you know I can
[1:00:41] wrap myself up like a bubble and tumble
[1:00:44] to the bottom of the hole and I'm
[1:00:46] probably going to still be really
[1:00:47] confused at the bottom so you have to
[1:00:50] you have to become skillful Rider you
[1:00:53] have to become a mature Christian that's
[1:00:55] fully committed to this promise oh yeah
[1:00:57] the faith sold out to this message of
[1:01:00] just a message as Jesus Christ Haven and
[1:01:04] praise go I can't lay that out any
[1:01:08] harder that you have to become skillful
[1:01:10] with the revelation that's being
[1:01:12] delivered to you because you can know
[1:01:14] all the mysteries you can have all the
[1:01:16] revelation you can have all the quotes
[1:01:17] you can listen to all the tapes you can
[1:01:20] listen to all the ministers and you can
[1:01:22] have all that knowledge but if you don't
[1:01:23] become skillful and how you use it won't
[1:01:26] have any effect you'll speak and nothing
[1:01:28] will happen have to become skillful mmm
[1:01:33] praise the Lord
[1:01:34] I've got another scripture I want to go
[1:01:36] to I was try not to make this long I
[1:01:39] don't want to keep it too long Hebrews
[1:01:44] 5/5 13 see everyone that uses milk is
[1:01:50] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:01:52] for he is obeyed but strong meat
[1:01:56] belongeth to them that are of full age
[1:01:58] even those who by reason of use have
[1:02:01] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:02:03] good and evil
[1:02:05] now I said to you before about that word
[1:02:08] perfect that I wanted to pick up on that
[1:02:11] meaning again and then this statement to
[1:02:14] them that are of a full age it has the
[1:02:16] same same meaning in the concordance as
[1:02:20] that perfect when we read faith by works
[1:02:24] being made perfect as strong meat
[1:02:27] belongeth to them that are a full age to
[1:02:29] the ahmet have come to maturity so them
[1:02:31] that have come to the full you know
[1:02:33] brother Brennan was the first fruits of
[1:02:35] the earth coming to maturity for the
[1:02:38] sage to bring this message they give you
[1:02:40] one has to come there
[1:02:42] right now you have to come into a full
[1:02:45] age they may be perfect they may
[1:02:47] complete strong meters to them to that a
[1:02:51] complete that have consummated their
[1:02:53] relationship to Christ and it becomes
[1:02:56] skilful to handle this word and speak in
[1:02:58] the name of Jesus this this is not for
[1:03:03] everyone that calls himself a believer
[1:03:06] it's for them that a complete in Christ
[1:03:08] with the blood of interplay because if
[1:03:10] you don't have but on display it's not
[1:03:12] for you this power that we're talking
[1:03:14] about so I really wanted to just keep
[1:03:19] this thought to this are you committed
[1:03:23] to writing this trail are you totally
[1:03:26] sold out that this is thus saith the
[1:03:28] Lord this message is right or are you
[1:03:32] gonna start writing down that trail and
[1:03:34] checking out on each of a bluff because
[1:03:37] I want to know that I'm sold out I want
[1:03:39] to know that I believe what I believe
[1:03:40] then I want to know that what I believe
[1:03:43] is the truth and then once I know that I
[1:03:46] can have absolute total confidence total
[1:03:49] faith that this is right this is the
[1:03:51] right direction that it'll take me right
[1:03:53] through yes just keep looking forward to
[1:03:55] the end of the trail don't take your
[1:03:57] eyes off Jesus and he'll see you through
[1:03:59] any moon we're gonna have faith to
[1:04:03] believe the supernatural is going to
[1:04:04] take place before you and fullness and I
[1:04:08] know some of you have seen supernatural
[1:04:10] happen in the church before the gifts
[1:04:13] have been with us the gifts have been
[1:04:14] with us ever since Pentecost
[1:04:16] but brother Branham was the firstfruits
[1:04:19] to come to maturity but I'm expecting to
[1:04:22] see an outpouring of those same works
[1:04:25] but it will be for the bride and as that
[1:04:30] whole field comes to maturity that
[1:04:32] combine harvester will come down and
[1:04:34] gather us up I mean now I'm feeling that
[1:04:38] that time is at hand they will maybe
[1:04:40] it'll be a few more years but it's a
[1:04:42] hand
[1:04:43] you know think about brother brother
[1:04:45] Isaac's vision for this movie I thought
[1:04:48] you know I truly believe that there must
[1:04:51] be enough time left to bring forth the
[1:04:54] smoothie I almost feel that
[1:04:56] it's maybe going to be a part of this
[1:04:58] fulfillment of preaching to the lost
[1:05:03] souls so it's pulling out any other
[1:05:05] message as putting out there what's
[1:05:07] taken place and people can't deny it you
[1:05:13] know I was told I said we may not know
[1:05:16] the day but we know the season yeah
[1:05:20] going through a change in season and I'm
[1:05:24] talking natural now when the season
[1:05:26] begins to change means these things that
[1:05:29] start happening there's a feeling that
[1:05:31] goes with it you know that the leaves
[1:05:33] start turning colors and you can reveal
[1:05:35] these these the change in the wind the
[1:05:37] changing the temperature the changes and
[1:05:40] you know that something's changing those
[1:05:43] were coming a change and I believe the
[1:05:45] season right now is changing you can
[1:05:48] feel the tension that's out there in the
[1:05:50] world like I went down to get some
[1:05:53] groceries the other day and there's a
[1:05:55] man walking around the supermarket
[1:05:56] aisles and he has a full spraying mask
[1:06:00] on on his head like totally
[1:06:03] encapsulating his head with her look
[1:06:05] like he is walking around a nuclear
[1:06:06] power plant and that kind of sounds
[1:06:09] ridiculous but people were scared people
[1:06:12] were had a fear come over them because
[1:06:15] even the non-christian they can sense
[1:06:18] that something's happening because of
[1:06:20] will can't just go on the way it's going
[1:06:22] on us over those road ends corrupted and
[1:06:27] there's coming a change and people were
[1:06:29] worried because they don't know what the
[1:06:31] future holds the future holds but we as
[1:06:35] Christians we know what the future holds
[1:06:40] we can have faith to believe because we
[1:06:43] know the privilege that's been given to
[1:06:47] the bride there's many people out there
[1:06:49] that have conspiracy theories of our the
[1:06:52] 5gs causing viruses it's just a load of
[1:06:55] annoyance but they want to have
[1:06:56] something that they can tie to something
[1:06:58] that they can hold to basically they
[1:07:00] want to have something they can put
[1:07:01] faith into and but there's no this
[1:07:05] there's no redemption and their faith
[1:07:07] there's no there's no light at the end
[1:07:09] of tunnel
[1:07:10] and having that conspiracy belief but
[1:07:13] believing in the fluid this light at the
[1:07:15] end of the tamale yeah is going to take
[1:07:18] you in a rapture amen well the same way
[1:07:23] that I know these seasons are changing
[1:07:26] it's the same way that I know that we
[1:07:28] entering into the in time season I can
[1:07:31] feel it
[1:07:32] amen so I just pray that you can glean
[1:07:39] some words out of this little fordham
[1:07:40] and take something home talk about
[1:07:44] something see what it does for you I
[1:07:48] trust there something have spoken will
[1:07:52] hit home amen so I'll turn it back over
[1:07:58] to you brother I'm going
[1:07:59] maybe we can sing a couple of songs what
[1:08:17] bless you brother James could be so rich
[1:08:18] - my brother let's slap hands for the
[1:08:20] Lord
[1:08:25] radda may God bless you for such
[1:08:28] wonderful ways that remind us about the
[1:08:33] hour that we are living in amen may God
[1:08:36] really help us may God bring us to that
[1:08:39] level you know where we can be able to
[1:08:41] be right this trail again
[1:08:44] Amen hallelujah and we're gonna sing one
[1:08:49] or two songs but maybe before we do that
[1:08:55] can you can just be reverent and just
[1:09:02] maybe the brothers to pray for us and
[1:09:07] just - amen

[1:09:58] daily to further the kingdom of God Lord

[1:11:24] would minister to the people now
[1:11:26] Lord minister to them love and the true
[1:11:28] way of getting out of this place Lord
[1:11:30] Jesus without having to see things Lord
[1:11:33] I believe that every one of us Lord has
[1:11:35] come to a place where you're talking to
[1:11:37] each of our hearts Lord and saying they
[1:11:39] must be a friend they must be a were
[1:11:41] calling there must be someone Lord that
[1:11:43] wants to know about you Lord and if we
[1:11:45] don't shine our light how would they
[1:11:47] know how would they see Jesus Christ
[1:11:49] today on this earth Lord if we don't
[1:11:52] reflect Jesus Christ within us I pray
[1:11:54] that you would you get us all to check
[1:11:56] up and to shake up Lord and stand up
[1:11:59] Lord and keep walking forth father and
[1:12:01] and to keep on being salty Lord and to
[1:12:03] my brother Chris sit back then and it
[1:12:05] touched me so much well then that salt
[1:12:07] would connect with that meat Lord and it
[1:12:10] would absolutely preserve that meat Lord
[1:12:12] for that rapture father I pray that we
[1:12:15] will be that so we won't just be thrown
[1:12:17] on the on the road and on the wayside
[1:12:19] Lord but absolutely can make whether the
[1:12:22] meat thorn in due season Lord to bring
[1:12:24] forth your word on this earth thank you
[1:12:26] so much for brother James that gave this
