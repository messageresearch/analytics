something with little resurrected living God the I am the ever-present loving one the one who's been raised up out of history the one that's here this morning to bring deliverance to bring life to

word this morning father for you liken it to food and we've become one with that so easily Lord father let us become one with the Word of God this morning the Lord just take control of every spirit in this building I just want to bind the spirit of unbelief that will try and attack every mind in this place no one is exempt and father I just thank you that there is Liberty because your spirit is here and let it be poured out over each one of us this morning Lord this all we want Wallace you have your way this morning father Lord we're in the Holy of Holies now we're entered in by the blood

just ask that you would have your way and all of our lives each one of us Lord want to leave here changed we want to leave here closer to you we want to leave here with something less in this world on us we want to lay aside every weight and every sin that thus so easily beset us Lord and run with patience the race that is set before us her Lord exposed the weights this morning Lord any weight that's hanging onto our lives that's holding us back that's blocking our channels that's destroying priesthood I pray in Jesus name that you would liberate this morning fun let us look Lord by your grace now into the perfect law of Liberty in the name of Jesus Christ amen and the church said amen hallelujah musicians amen take me into the Holy of Holies what a prayer what a desire amen while you're standing we can turn in our Bibles to 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verses 17 to 18 quite warm I'm just going to turn this down a little bit I hope everyone's okay with that and we read from verse 17 and 18 of second Corinthians now the Lord is that spirit amen and where the Spirit of the Lord is where the Spirit of the Lord is who believes the spirit of what is here this morning hey ma'am there is Liberty hallelujah who knows what Liberty is freedom hallelujah we're the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom amen from bondage and sin amen but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord have changed and to the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord amen you may be seated in the presence of God this morning hallelujah you know you asked that question you prayed that when you were singing take me into the Holy of Holies who believes that when you pray that it happens it's not just a pretty song you get a little shiver but you see if you had found yourself walking out of God's presence you know surely goodness and mercy shall follow me yes but you know brother Branham talked about somebody that they can actually come out of a person with the Holy Ghost can actually come out of fellowship with them if they grieve him and a faith they can think they can get a wolf nature on him and and that and the Holy Spirit goes and waits up on a tree he uses that as an analogy and he perches there any waits he waits for the Lamb nature to come back you know what the good thing is through the blood of Jesus Christ that's not a groveling back to God you don't grovel your way back to God amen hallelujah the moment that you repent the moment that you make it right you're a fellowship has restored 100% there is no it's like you never did it in the first place that's justified amen it's beyond forgiving amen you're beyond forgiving this morning you're beyond forgiving hallelujah do you realize that is there a reality to you this you are beyond forgiving you are justified in God's eyes you never sinned in the first place that's the power of his blood that's why when you sing take me into the Holies of Holies and maybe before you sung that song there was something that happened in your life and you said Lord if it to you forgive me father I don't want that in my life anymore I'll lay those things down these weights that so it easily beset me I lay them all down because I want to be in your presence I want to be in fellowship with you I want to walk in your presence this morning I want to live in your presence I want to remain in an atmosphere of perfect love hallelujah I don't want anything to be able to affect me anymore Amen I want to be you know and this was what I'm preaching to myself here I want to remain a net presence hallelujah when someone to meet annoys me or some person or some circumstance is annoying to me I don't want to allow that to pull me down into a natural stand to anger and into frustration you know and there's a lot of things in our lives that happen around us and our lives that pull us into frustration or you know for young guys they'll see a pretty female walking down the street and they lust after that female and that pulls them down into a carnal state and they get frustrated and the devil starts condemning them because they're you know they're getting all condemned over the thing and and then they find themselves you know that blessed atmosphere that they had was gone but then you see the look knows your heart and he knows what you need and I'm gonna clear to you today this is Liberty day and this is Liberty morning amen this is your Liberty morning this is the morning if there's anything in your life that you want Liberty from this is your morning this is your day this is your hour to be liberated because the Liberty is here with the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty hallelujah if there's anything you just put it before the Lord this morning you just lay it in his feet this morning I've laid mine at his feet I've put mine before the Lord the things that I need out of my life that I want out of my life that I know that God has delivered me from that I know the blood is sufficient for that I know the Holy Ghost will to phi verses it says through the spirit that we multiplied the deeds of this flesh hallelujah is through the spirit you know he comes into our life it comes and he gives us power over our spirit and flesh over that old nature that wants to rise up why do you think in Romans 6 that says let not sin reign in your mortal bodies to obey it and the last there off you see their old nature has will then old nature wants to rise up then old nature has a constant uprising that it wants to do in your life because it wants to sin it wants to be sinful and it nibble it won't ever stop until you get rid of this body but you see that the sended captain hallelujah that the sins down into our life to give us dominion over spirit and flesh hey man aren't you so glad that you can have now that is not now this is where it becomes amazing now you your leadership if you don't roll over your spirit with malevolence and and and and legalism no she'll be a very unhappy old nature you have to rule with love you have to rule with benevolence you have to rule your spirit and take dominion over your flesh like a righteous King that is fear don't put yourself under so much pressure all the time you got to put all these things in all your gonna the safe this and it because you'll just end up getting yourself in a fix and you keep not getting condemned and then you need to fake the purpose of fellowship with God because you're so condemned all the time in your heart you don't want to be that way God didn't make it that way he's made it so that we can grow so that we can be freed from things a little bit but we stay and fellowship with him along the way isn't that a great provision who's thankful for that provision thankful that we don't have to be condemned to all our way to perfection we can be liberated to perfection hallelujah that's worth praising God about amen okay let's just read from Romans 11 it says behold therefore the goodness and severity of God it's quite a you could say an oxymoron of of words and the same sentence the goodness and severity of God and you know he was talking about Israel and how they you know God was so good to them but there was also a justice for what they would if they if they sewed the wrong seed they would get the wrong harvest that's the severity so there is a severity so yes and I preached the Liberty and and and it's so good and you don't get condemned but there is also what you shall sow you shall reap so there is also a harvest that comes from the works of must flesh we doin the things that we say and what we allow ourselves to be ruled by and it's a very curve and it's and it's a very stimulating and all the stuff going on in our lives and we're constantly making decisions and and the devil's got it all he's got a lot of stuff covered all around he's got all the media and he's got everything and there's all these voices and they're trying to and every day you make that we all make decisions what are we going to allow to rule us what are we going to allow to lead us now well the I say liberty day the subject is taking advantage of Liberty now there's a two types of advantage taking there's an there's a positive advantage taking which God wants us to take advantage of our Liberty and make the most of it being this taking advantage of Liberty in this negative sense where you the we're grace becomes a bandage for you for your desire for sin where grace becomes abandoned for you adhering to voices that are not the voice of God for you to become subject to a certain spirit or subject to a fashion or subject to a cultural mindset or subject to your own humanistic thoughts and leadership there is that taking advantage of the grace of God and so we see we want to draw a really fine balance of taking advantage of Liberty we don't want to and you see there is too as their administration is different from ours there is an administration that forces people to do a certain way and be a certain thing and perform and in the church you might look at the church from an outward perspective of your visiting and it looks so good and everything everyone's behaving themselves but down inside is a dictatorship going on and things is not what they seem all right but then the people are conforming to an image they kind of is not necessarily a Victorian dictatorship but there's a pressure right a real pressure from the people and one little thing steps out and everyone cranes their neck and looks and goes and then you get a you'll get them you'll get the Deacons coming and seeing you after church and saying look at the performance you did they don't know why weren't you there why weren't you at church this week and what was this going on here and everything is all administered by humanistic leadership and and it's pushed on you and the pressures on you I was reading the doctrines of the exclusive Brisbane Church because I know a lot of them and I'm really fascinated by why they are the way they are it's amazing how much that whole it's like replacing the Holy Spirit to - there's an image and they read in the Bible and everything they have in the Bible that they do is is based on Scripture it's not really anything that isn't based on Scripture but one it's the slant on it but - it's it's actually they read it and they go we've got to do this and so they administer then so because the Holy Ghost was I'm just gonna stay at playing the Holy Ghost has departed from them they don't have the Holy Ghost so therefore they've got to push it on the people and make it happen right so that's but then this that way actually made its way into the frame we've got a message - is that whole humanistic leadership and their whole make every one brother branham preaches the image so Joshua preached the land and gave them their inheritance so they went and got it brother Branham preached now lend our inheritance the image of Christ the perfection the manifested sons what it is to be a real son of God to have dominion and the life that you should live in the conduct order and doctrine of your life and how you carry yourself with an excellent spirit and you're in time Daniel that nothing can affect you and even your enemies test if I could against you about you right and then so the ministry you will get excited and the people get excited and then they make it try and force it to happen and you end up with miserable a miserable condition at first it might be okay when people first get saved and they're all but then when all the trials start and it all gets hard and and that just becomes miserable and the children you know they try and force her on the children and children don't have the Holy Ghost yet and they get they just become rebellious and it just causes division so there's there okay there's that side then there's the other side which we we going to go to the balance after this but there's the other side which the the administration knows the image and that's being preached but nothing there is no enforcement of it right but but and and and the complete liberal siders just allow the people to discover God for themselves completely right and and and the people and and and and that where it goes out of balances let's and become rampant just let let it all sort of just happen and don't worry about anything and because people will grow and they'll have their own kind of experience once one day but you'll find that the Holy Ghost departs from that too because it becomes too much for the pure Holy Ghost it's a Holy Spirit it doesn't want that to happen and then you find the balance and the balance is the leadership of the Holy Ghost in the gifts and the callings and gifts of God and the pastoral gifts and the ministry gifts and the Deacons gifts and the everyone's gifts and the sunday-school gifts and the musicians gives God being poured out into the people God being manifested now when you're in the balance which I believe we're in a balance where we can and that we can grow nothing's forced on anyone no one gets things forced on them to be a certain way but yet its breached the image is preached and that's good now we this is where it becomes like the Garden of Eden again we have the opportunity to decide are we going to embody this message are we going to let it become flesh are we going to embrace it and this is where we can take advantage on both sides so we're sitting in between heaven and earth you could say well heaven and hell sorry brother Brad said we're actually dangling over hell with the Word of God so you can rely on the the strength of that word and your faith in that word because we're hanging over hell with the word of God and it's not to scare anybody but that's that's what it is and it really is what it is now that chain if that chains holding us and this is just coming fresh but if that chains holding us I'm going to embrace that chain I ain't going to just be wishy-washy about it you know I'm not going to be casual about it but when that chain gets preached to me and it sounds bad chain but the word is like we're a love present of Jesus Christ which came to him in the chains of His divine love and if that chain i when i hear that chain being ministered to me with all my heart with all my energy and everything that i have i'm going to embrace it I'm gonna hold it I'm gonna believe it become one with me and I want it to become flesh in my life and if there's anything that the Lord puts on my heart this is a blockage in your and your channels of inspiration and communication and that's stopping you from this oh god take it well lay it down if I have to suffer for your name's eight praise the Lord that's the balance it's kind of that's where we're going so it's behold therefore the goodness and severity of God the goodness as being ministered him we're just being blessed and things that's happening in lives are changing transforming power is here hallelujah the transforming power of God is here amen the goodness but then there's the severity of God we cannot escape the severe of God we cannot escape the Justice of God amen if we shun the goodness amen so when that chains hanging over hanging me over hell I'm holding on to that chain with everything that I am and whenever a word comes forth from me I take it for me amen this sermon is for everybody amen and I encourage you don't pitchfork today because it's also an easy ones a pitchfork on you no because it's just personal so we lit lit let's own it for ourselves and and you know I enjoy this type of the subject because this is our inheritance we can be free from all bondage anson amen so says here in James 1:25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continuous theron he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed shall be blessed in the action of his life he that does it because you see we can have faith we can have all the faith and and say it all out but that faith needs to have an action their faith needs to have substance that faith that action that needs to put on flesh that's what I'm saying that's when you hear the word and you and you welcome it you say yes that's for me who old whatever it takes I want that for my life even now hallelujah I don't want to just sit here and enjoy the message and sit here and enjoy the revelation and enjoy how the all comes together and the vision and all of those things but I want and I'm going to have the very embodiment the very faith and because I want the the works of faith to be expressed in my life I want the reality in my life I don't just want to sit and enjoy it on Sunday and sit and enjoy it when I listen to a prophet or a preacher during a week and but I want it to be in my life I want the works to be expressed and come forth amen so whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and I believe we're going to look into this law and a law as an enforcement of something that is substantial and something that has that I don't even know how to express it but a law is something strong and this is a law of Liberty and the law of Liberty liberate sus from sin amen the law of Liberty you see it's connected to this Ten Commandments in the whole law and the prophets hanging upon the Royal law which is the love thy neighbor love thy God with all thy heart and love thy neighbour as thyself and all the law and prophets hang from these and God says that I will write my laws and the fleshly tables of their hearts and I will put my laws in their mind and this morning may it just be put in your mind again may it be renewed in your mind the law of Liberty that all those things that the Prophet preached that seemed like just trivial stuff and carnal not carnal but natural things and all that stuff that's been written on your heart and hid in the prophet now when you receive the Holy Ghost and then the prophets come along and he starts putting it into your mind it's that's preaching into your mind and then fun finally one day you say yes I'm greeing with that I want to do that and all of a sudden that just gains access to it what's written in your heart already and it pulls it out and you it becomes flesh and faith becomes works well faith puts on works so look until it's look into the perfect law of Liberty and continuous Theron Amen he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed Alleluia stand fast with Galatians 5:1 stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage hallelujah we are in a battle Saints we're in a fight this is a constant fight don't think Oh finally it's over it's not over it's this fight so if you just if you can there's Isaac preacher's resolve if you can just resign yourself and resolve the issue in your mind I'm fighting until the day I'm dying you'll actually start to be encouraged in it you'll encourage yourself on the Lord you'll start really gearing your thinking in your mind and the way you are and the actions of your life towards this battle towards this race that is set before you run it with patience Amy the devil is going to take and he's going to take advantage of you if you've got weights and sins in your life that easily beset him he'll take advantage of those things it's illegal ground into your life that he will use to try and get at you and because they're things and you know that they're wrong and there's legal ground things in your home that may be just pleasing to the Lord there's also legal ground for the devil to come into your home and cause trouble that's why it's so important that we discern as parents as we discern as children as this pleasing to the Lord ask you everything that you do all that you have what all the stuff that you watch everything the question should be Lord is this pleasing to you as this pleasing to you because if it's not the devil's got legal ground it's a spiritual legal ground now and he uses that against people to try and get at them and get at them and get at them and pull them down because he doesn't want sons of God to rise up to the position because when the son is in his position the devil was very sad very scared hey man he's scared of you he fears you amen so he'll do everything he can to push you down to keep you on the ground to clip your wings keep your wings clipped hallelujah but you see God has liberated us amen so that we don't have to have clipped wings so that we don't have to be earthbound Birds a million chickens in the barn the hallelujah he's PISA liberated us so that we can spread our wings and salt amen hallelujah you can just spread your wings this morning spread your wings and let the Holy Ghost lift you hallelujah if the Word of God just bring an image to you this morning hallelujah hallelujah Sosa's we want to come into this Liberty with a balanced approach we want to be balanced than the approach of this Liberty we this fellowship is blessed you can choose what you take no one Deacon's that going to come round to your house since that rebuking you for little things all the time which the way it used to be it's not going to happen amen and you're not going to get pressure and people looking at you and coming and telling you off some dog medic brother coming out of the woods stomping at you and starting to rebuke you for something that he thinks you did wrong and really you didn't mean to you know all that stuff is not here but and because it's not here we have a Liberty now to make our own decisions but I want to encourage you this morning don't take advantage of it don't take advantage of this Liberty in a negative way but but but with all your heart seek the kingdom of God first and lay aside every weight that does beset so that we as a fellowship can soar into the heavenly places amen so that the Lord feels welcome to sweep through with the operation of the Holy Ghost so that the spiritual gifts can be all restored and the prayer meetings can be blessed was the supernatural hello Louie oh because you see the Spirit is like a dove and Timur and you see he wants us to be in of one mind of one Accord with one desire hallelujah putting God first amen and it's easy that's the easy way hallelujah the devil will make you think oh it's going to be so hard if iris goes out of my life it's going to be so hard because I'm going to be thinking about a little time and these through this and this through that and the circumstance and that and this confusion no the easy way it's to just let God have his way he brings it all into place he's the master mm-hmm he's the master builder a man he knows how to build our life and when it's all laid down when everything's laid down it's all down to scratch and he's you're giving God a white canvas to build on he can paint your life he can paint that image you didn't see the image before the foundation of the world he saw it he knows what you really are he knows what you're made of he put all your parents and great-great-great grandparents all together because he knew what you needed to look like he painted you and he got all other different temperaments and everything in the circumstance so that your temperament would be a certain way so that when he brings you like a bell you would ting a certain way amen so you'd have a certain ring a certain personality he saw you and he knows exactly the ingredients that need to happen in your life and you see we get so caught up with all these things and ambitions and hopes and plans and everything it's so caught up with it all torn down by this complex and this fear and everything like that and the Lord just wants us to say you done you finished lay it at my feet let me paint the image that I saw before the foundation of the world let me do it hallelujah cuz as soon as we stop trying to do it then God can do it hallelujah Amen it's you know a lot of us have been to school all our lives you know and school taught us all wrong school brought the wrong ideas and that was you do it all yourself your self esteem and selfless everything self build yourself up and push yourself into this thing and you have to achieve and you can't get nothing unless you earn it this is the whole mentality and you just get it drilled into you for fifteen or thirteen years or whatever it is all of those all day every day it strollin mine if you don't have Christian parents I mean it just gets children at home too oh you know what I mean and so you see that as a real issue that happens because the Christianity and the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven is the exact opposite Amen we just lay it all down we surrender it all and let God build us hallelujah so in Liberty he's liberated us from bondage in sin liberated us from culture man that's a tough one it gets so engrained in our thinking our culture our national culture our family culture whatever tribal cultures you know all those things as ingrained down into the almost into the genetics ridin and generation after generation after generation and it becomes this and a default in your life and you know if you if the devil catches you off-guard he will get you on that but God has liberated us from that you see a heavenly culture has descended in the form of a mighty angel with an open book in his hands who knows the mighty angel with the open book in his hands who's eaten from the mighty angels hand this morning hallelujah who's eaten from his hand who has eaten that book this morning will I tell you this morning if you're reading from their book you're feeding from a heavenly culture hallelujah you're feeding from a hidden culture that Heaven culture has come down because you see an earthly culture rose up out of the pits of hell amen and it got it got it it's real wings through all the media and all those things and and all of its just been played on and and you can see all of the evil cultures out of all the different tribes of Africa and all those things has kind of found its way into the Western society as well and all these bondages that have been part of things for thousands of years is all manifested on the earth what to magnify Satan's Babylonian culture magnify this culture that draws people away from God and keeps people away from God and makes them diff to God you'll find a lot of the stuff comes from all of those things but you see if you've come into fellowship with their angel amen if you you have received heavenly culture now it's your decision here because remember this image is not forced on you no one's forcing it on you there's no pressure for you I mean you create you there is pressure but it's not coming from men it's coming from the Holy Ghost James me gentle pressure and because there are people that have become heavenly cultured there's also that pressure as well you're seeing them and you're watching them and there you can see them having joy and peace and you wonder why you you don't have that same peace because you is a culture in your life probably that you still allowing so shape you store dictate to you and so there is that pressure and you and but the thing is no one's going to force you but don't take advantage of their you make the decision now I want that culture that heavily culture that's my eternal identity that's my culture that's where I come from I came from God and I go back to God amen hallelujah you're part of him jesus said in that day what day this day the day that all the mysteries of God shall be unveiled and revealed him a mighty God unveiled before us that day you shall know and I am and my father he and me and I knew who knows their eternal value who understands and who has come to a realization of their I turn eternal identity in that day you shall know you shall know it should be an intimate and understanding in your life hallelujah he was in the father and you're in him where does that put you then hallelujah that puts you in the father before the foundation of the world an eternal being so when he said the joke where were you in the sons of God shouted together in the morning stars saying where were you hallelujah you were there you were singing and rejoicing and eternity and I'll tell you right now you are there right now amen brother Brandon when he was taken up beyond the curtain of time generally said to his congregation I saw you all thee they must have blown their minds and probably went over their heads but today as the word has become open and things have become more intimate and God as it's 50 years later we can identify with that I'm actually there I'm part of God and part of the eternal being hallelujah and so if I'm a part of that then I'm going to make a decision I'm not forced to by any peer pressure because the churches are the Church of balance Liberty but I'm going to decide I want to be part of that heavenly culture I don't want to be part of the sinfully culture no Mahal I don't want to let this cultural ways and customs conform me because where does it come from bevel huh Amen hallelujah oh this is not on my list but I'll say it anyway it's come on my mind so I should just say Nebuchadnezzar made a big golden image you know and the whole world know and ruled at that time had to bow down and worship that image whole world and the way that he put them into that trance was through music Hollywood music as the now generation back there it was just the Pipers and Harper's and dulcimers and whatever they had when they started playing the whole Babylon bow down worship but the people that defied the King Nebuchadnezzar which is just like Satan today the people that said no I'm not going to allow this Hollywood music to shape my life I'm not going to fall into a trance to that music I'm not going to allow that to make me bow down to this big image that Satan has put up this big golden image this big statue of idolatry there's big Babylonian worship this big unified churches and all those things I'm not going to allow that what does that make nebuchadnezzar at you what did that what had it what anemic accounted nebuchadnezzar react how did he react to the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he got angry he was so angry at them that he lost his cool and he lost his composure so you can imagine Satan's lost his composure at you he gets so angry at you because you reject the image that he's put up that he wants the whole world to fall down he wants a son or daughter of God to break the word he wants a son or daughter of God to go to hell that's what he wants that's his whole life's intention everything that he's wants is the one thing as for one of God's children to go to hell and be lost but King God lose one hallelujah all that the father has given me will come to me and I will in no wise cast that anyone that comes to me amen hallelujah hallelujah I believe we've come to him I believe as I said before he's not that the church's door for a long time now since 1950 whatever he's not that the church's door come out or sup with you coming there fellowship are being booted out of the churches but I want to fellowship with individuals when calling a bride out of a church or to fellowship with you and I believe I'm talking to people that heard that voice he came knocking amen he came knocking and he called Junie put and and now you're feasting hallelujah amen but you've rejected that image you've rejected that thing that Nebuchadnezzar is placed and I'm glad but you've seen by rejecting that you make the you make the devil very angry hallelujah and so all of the trials that you go through and all the hardships that you face as a result of you rejecting that image and there is that's black and white it's a black and white experience you know when you've rejected that because everything starts going hard for you and the devil gets pretty mad you know the glorious thing is that when they got chucked in that furnace bound what was happening when they got in there I mean one of those trials those fiery trials do in their life hallelujah Amen seasons so proud that he can't help but try and hurt you but every time he tries to hurt you he makes you stronger he makes you more holy he makes you pure and you get liberated Amen liberated from these things hallelujah Amen the pure in heart shall see God Amen who wants to see God who loves seeing God Amen amen because your hearts being made pure your you see that's a small verse with a big meaning he's purifying and cleaning out all the channels cleaning out your spirit he's giving you your land all your promised land is all inside here you could say you know it's all in here and little by little I'll give you it little by little I'm gonna liberate you so that you can see God Amen took me as a psalm and it says that basically as you grow I'm going to exalt you to inherit the land oh when you and you shall see it I can't remember it is but I'll find it one day so you've been liberated from culture and one of the main things that you're liberated from is yourself it's a big one to get liberated from yourself and that really doesn't come to completion until you've got your glorified body right but you still get liberated from man the worst enemy you're carrying him around you know it's and and really that that's he's come to liberate us from that his Liberty will liberate you and has from demon possession demon oppression all complexes don't own any of them none of them they are all going and we're watching them fall off people hallelujah actually so glad that complexes are leaving people amen that we're part of a group a church of believers where the resurrected Living God is delivering people from little tiny things stuff that you would find that people die with right people die with those things and have done for all over the last 2,000 years Christians non-christians whatever they died in them Luther probably died full of complexes full of troubles troubled mind probably mental illness even I don't know yes he and he was used of God mightily and all these men and woman used of God mightily throughout all the ages died full of complexes to hide full of things in their lives that it wasn't the season for deliverance hallelujah they were there was not an expectation upon their life for a rector in faith there wasn't an expectation on their life for perfection to come into the full realization but there an eternal being part of God hallelujah it wasn't the expectation wasn't on them but God has placed an expectation on you now don't get burdened down by that because he'll also fulfill it he is fulfilling it hallelujah it is happening amen liberation liberation from all the tiniest little complexes that you think a tiny little tiny things someone did that you way back then and it's and you might think it's so small but it might be blocking a huge portion of heaven in your life it might be blocking a huge step in your life fears and stuff that you binds you down and out of balance emotional out of imbalances deliverance you can be delivered this morning if there's anything in your life this is your day Liberty Day now Liberty day Liberty morning hallelujah amen the Sun has risen amen it is the rising of the Sun you are the resurrection amen you're part of it aiming the resurrection is in you you see because of that because of the age we live in because of the season it is this is the season for the tiniest little things that you think is small he delivered he gives you Liberty from all those things no and like I said don't get condemned because you've got them still he doesn't you see God as long as when God puts his finger on something in your life that you say yes Lord Lord it's I want to deal with this I want freedom from this and you know what I'm going to stick on this Lord with you until I'm gone it's gone I'm not going to allow the devil to try and overwhelm me with all the other stuff and trying to confuse it that's one of us tactics you know God starts dealing with the small thing in your life and so what happens is you end up all these trials and the devil tries to take your attention off that and make you all overwhelmed by your own failures again and that thing gets lift again then you go around the mountain and around the mountain and around the mountain and keep going around and finally the trial comes again boom don't be distracted don't let the devil distract you you know and we're called to that we're called to be free from the tiniest little complexes and I and this is really what's happening in our day if we can allow God if we can take this word and embrace it with all of our hearts because you see God is speaking word to us he is speaking the very creative power creative power is coming over the pulpit creative power is coming out of the tapes creative power is coming out of our mouths amen hallelujah why because he's delivering us from complexes that have blocked it on all of our lives little things that you think is just I'll live with it don't live with it amen that's not heavenly culture hey man you know what heavenly caught perfection as purity as perfect faith as eternal life love Amen / pure perfect love amen no fears no imbalanced emotions he's delivering he gives us T from unfruitful Nastase achill e connected to everything's kind of interconnected but he gives us Liberty from unfruitful Ness he wants us to be fruitful amen and so that's why he's taking all these tiny little things and he's dealing with them and His grace and His mercy because those are the sort of things that stop us from being fruitful amen we can be doing a great work and it might not be doing much fruit but the work needs to have the fruit and if the work has the Holy Ghost the real Spirit of God manifesting forth himself it will have the fruit you know the tree of life were actually part of that you know we're part of the tree of life with a branch he's the vine and year the branches and what does he do he purchased that prunes it so that it becomes more fruitful hear me do you know the tree of knowledge is also got branch and that's the people that eat off the tree of knowledge and the people that do the will of Satan that is the tree of knowledge branches and he also has evil fruit but his fruit doesn't bring life it's a hybrid fruit it might plant a tree in a sea a hybrid seed will grow once or and the generation dies off after about three generations you know it just cannot continue on sometimes not even one generation sometimes it just doesn't grow anything but you know it's just but there is the two trees right there but God delivers us from unfruitful nurse his light shines on our lives to give us discernment to discern between the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life to divide soul and spirit the joints and marrow to give us a discernment to be able to make judge righteous judgment amen and so it's so important and I encourage you listen to the tapes listen to the message amen every day put the message of brother Branham on your player put him in your phone put him put it everywhere listen to it you remember the story he was baptizing on the Ohio River in nineteen thirty six or seven or three I can't remember but one of those and that pillar of fire came down from heaven and said as john the baptist was sent to forerun first coming so I seen you with a message to 4-under second coming when I read that in my two weeks of being a Christian not even that maybe a week I knew from that moment that this is important I need it I need to hear this whenever this message is I want to become part of the me if this is for running the Second Coming then God has placed great emphasis great importance on my ears my eyes and heart and everything about me to receive that and I will do everything in my power to receive it when I first actually came after it because you know my story but so wit when I really gave my life to the Lord after I had had my little escapade and I gave my life to the Lord and I prayed and I prayed with all my heart Lord take everything out of me and I any knew that I was repenting he knew that I wanted to go and he gave me the Holy Ghost and you know what the first thing that happened to me was I got thirsty so thirsty and I couldn't wait to get the message just couldn't wait and I ordered it man and I was so like a young boy at Christmastime you know and when I got it I was so happy I was getting it on the air and I just hit I was like you know you're just dry thirsty and dry and cracked and you just get a nice cool drink and it was like that I was so relieving a message and I listened to a whole thing the whole message you know I'm not saying you should go listen to the whole message but which you can I mean he wouldn't hurt you but you know I'm just saying this what I did because I had the time I had the opportunity to do it because I was working in commercial jobs and I just had them an all day for four years just listening to the message and I was having a Jubilee a wonderful time washing by the water of the word washing cleansing liberating Amy the power that heaven has was being released through that voice now it was I wasn't just listening to some seventh-grade Kentuckian right I wasn't just listening to brother branham I was listening to the voice behind their voice amen and that voice is the voice of liberty their voice is what liberates people begs voices what brings people to the new birth voices what cuts off all of the flesh and all those that circumcise is the heart that voice hallelujah amen you know God's called us to a final cleansing you know today is a real there's a there's a thing that's happening in the bride and it's those last little things that have been holding on the tough ones that the heart the play the things that's long game issues you know long game who knows what long gamers you know these things that you deal with with people and you just say you know that that's just you just can't do it anymore and then there's the long game and that long game of stuff that it's just traits and little things that you know that and everyone knows that they're not pleasing to the Lord but they just are and it's wait this long name it's time for the long game things to disappear amen it's the grace of God is here to deal with the long game of shoes amen things that you have already resolved in your mind I'm gonna live with it I'm gonna be raptured with it you won't be raptured with it amen you will be liberated from it in its Liberty day today this Liberty day now hallelujah they've got the Lord Jesus Christ is here to bring liberty to speak Liberty and it's so simple you don't have to do anything other than ask him lord I want what that gone forever he knows mean you really want it and it'll be gone I trust you trust me he knows when you ask and you want it gone for a hundred percent it's God how could it not for remember he gave every man a measure of faith every man a measure of faith so the people might tell you all I don't have faith to believe for that to go and you do have faith to believe they forgot you do have faith to make that go you got given it that there was lying to you he lies and he tells you you don't have faith but the God of heaven and His Word says I gave every man a measure of faith so you've got faith to be delivered from the tiny little things and the biggest giant things amen you've got faith to be delivered from a big giant tumor that might grow that big amen hallelujah disappear in this twinkling of an eye amen you have that faith that's already in you amen orys alert ago hey man said we'd be liberated amen from unfruitful news we've been liberated from casual Christianity amen we've been liberated from taking advantage of the Liberty of the Holy Ghost amen we don't want to do that that's not something that's not our portion our portion is fervency our portion is as being on fire for God however you express that as your individual personality but the the reality is we've been liberated from a wantonness we've been liberated from casualness and taking things so casually this whole Laodicean spirit is casual that's missing it's you know just just take it easy you know someone said that to someone someone the other day just take it easy or like really just take it all easy you know it's some like hippie like movement that you man take it easy man you know like it's not like this it's not really the Christian thing just to take it all easy and just relax and just cruise and just mix in and and don't offend anybody but you know God hasn't called us to that I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ which is the power of God unto salvation amen god help me to not be ashamed you know we don't want to be embarrassed by the things of God and this society has got such a pressure that just keeps going on the people to make what our confession is embarrassing to make someone that stands rugged for the truth for the objective truth not some apparent truthless this person's truth and netbiz are true there's only one truth there's only one real truth and that's Christianity hallelujah and so the the looming pressure and it's growing is that don't ever talk about someone else's religion as if it's not true their religion is true this is true that's true that's true what is that there's no foundation there's no eternal life in that but you see we need to be courageous to stand and make a stand and not be casual about it god help us you see he's liberated us from that too and you know what causes that the fear of men so here you see when he liberates us from the fear of men and that's one of my ones that I've really had trouble with is not the fear now when I say the fear of men that's the extreme of it but mine is more I don't like to upset or try I don't like making other people feel uncomfortable because my I love to make people feel comfortable you know I like to make people feel real welcoming and I like them to eat nicely and you know really pour it on people I love it and so the downside of that is I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable and even if it means telling them about something that they I know they're not going to like you know and opportunities have come in my life where I have any opportunity to tell them I'm like Oh part of me really wants to and then the other parts like you know what they're gonna be uncomfortable and they probably not even gonna like me and they're gonna leave and whatever because it's gonna it's going to basically tell them that everything that their life is built on is wrong and that's what it's like and so the pressure of the society is casual take it easy cruise mix say the right things don't upset people it's just over us you know and it doesn't have to be a part of us hey man you're a Goshen that's darkness it's all darkness all mixing together murky there's no solid definition but you see Jesus Christ his definition Amen the Word of God has definition it's a definite thing and we should be on fire for God and I believe that we've been liberated from from the dousing of Satan's poisonous water that puts the fire out amen because you see God himself has come in this generation with an open book in his hand a man do you know that open bookers if I had one now it's the fan amen hallelujah he's failing the fire amen he's taking their book and he's Fanning you know all those husks and everything is all falling off a man because he's bringing you making you ready for the threshing floor you know so he can gather the wheat into the garner and take you hallelujah up into the rapture amen so he the personal presence the Purusha of God is here amen he has come himself in a spirit form to fan the fire to deliver to abolish death I am the bread of life that cometh from God out of heaven when he said that here he was walking in the Corporal body he that eateth from me shall never die amen what happened in Revelation tip 13 what happened hallelujah amen the same one now it wasn't corporal body now spiritual body King theophany I don't know if you've heard that expression before he's the king of our eternal bodies the king eternal body hallelujah the King angel the angel of the covenant with the rainbow about his head the face shining as a son a man what do to pierce through all the darkness pierce through all the clouds piercer all this murky casual christianity pierce Ruth's Babylonian religion so that you can take and eat the tree of life and live forever for in that and weird it is what was his dispensation who did he dispense it through he dispensed that whole thing through the Prophet through the seventh angel this you know that he was the vending machine if you can put it in terminology that we would kind of a parable that we would understand brother Branham was a vending machine for the Tree of Life now we don't pay for it amen that's free you just need to go up and you need to receive what God has for you hallelujah and so you see and I talked about this a bit earlier and maybe it's just coming back so now I can finish it I got so thirsty one day for this message I got so thirsty you know what that was I was speaking to Matthew about it the other day it was me fulfilling Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 which says and I heard another voice which speaketh from heaven I John the bride the individual now me and II I'm not John but I heard a voice which speaketh from heaven any man who's heard their voice oh you should be so thankful you've heard that voice one of their voice make you do Amen their voice lead you to feast on what those seven thunders spoke Amen that voice lead you gave you a thirst to take that book and eat it and you cannot be satisfied with anything else cannot go listen to some Benny Hinn or some tele evangelist it doesn't do it it has no value it has no I mean you probably feel good after listening to a sermon but it doesn't have that eternal hallmark of God now you listen to those tapes and you get thirsty because you heard their voice and you see you you come personally now to the Tree of Life who stands upon the sea and upon the earth they man what is he doing he's crushing down and taking dominion over Rome and over Hollywood which is the two lines the powers that rule this earth the powers and the influence that's killing this whole human race it's keeping them and also deceiving sons of God and you've been called very hand you've been called that's thirst in your life don't quench it with other things because it's very easy to quench that you can quench that thirst with other things small things busyness cultural and you see I told you being liberated from those things don't let anything else dictate to you but the feeding of the word should be more important to you than feeding of your mouth feeding your tummy amen I'm preaching to myself because everyone knows I like eating good we just praise the Lord Amen hallelujah so we've been delivered now and I'm sorry I probably didn't finish something but it will come back later but we've been delivered from cradle Christianity we've been liberated from casual Christianity hallelujah be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen that you may know what is that good and acceptable will of God make we're only in the intro but that's right there's different Liberation's that I was looking into well these two more things we've deliberated from death we're liberated from death why I just spoke about it we are eating from the tree of life did you know that we're eating from the tree of life he came but open-book honest what is it the pure Word of God brother Branham said that the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a hybrid that's the scripture mixed with man's was the Satan's wisdom it's a hybrid tree all denominationalism all the revivals that God even raised up this is where it becomes you have to really put your spiritual thinking on here all the revivals of Luther Wesley Baptist everything all the denominational revivals that God was in was still not the Tree of Life it was a part of it but because they were in the revival and they were part of the restoration God blinked an eye at their ignorance and all of the things that there is against all the complexes in their life all all the sins that they were still practicing all of the funny doctrines and Babylonian thinking and all of that stuff that kicked them on the ground kept them on the ground they couldn't be wretched in that condition and even people that fail to receive the fullness of this message that follow the Prophet they believed he's a prophet they can't be raptured without coming into the former's and eating from that tree people that get scared of that mighty angel they don't eat from their open book that's where their rapturing is there's a netbook your rapturing faith has been contained in that book and this is a sensitive subject and I'll probably get some people if they watch it they probably talk to talk about it you know but as a sensitive subject because these people that claim brother Branham as a prophet but because of complexes or because they're looking towards another age they're not eating from that book out of the hands of an angel it's scared of their angel because it because of false teaching but we have been called to eat from that tree we have been called to eat from the tree of life and that is he is the abolish heir of death he has abolished death and that's why we've been delivered from death hallelujah and you but you can see how God was in all those revivals all the way through he was in them but it wasn't at all that mighty angel came down and there is the very liberation from everything when you're feeding on that you're getting liberated from things you wouldn't even know and you probably never will know think about that things in your life that you probably never even knew were there liberated and in these things that just require your conscious attention things that require a physical practice of some sort you know some sort of thing you've got to go and do or some amendment you've got to make with somebody or some forgiveness you've got to do Liberty this is Liberty day Saints and so I encourage you see you the kingdom of God first seek you first what is that kingdom where is that Kingdom manifested and they're open book they're open book now it does it has I need to have it I should have a Bible you know but I'm I am a Laodicean age but that open book that has got everything in it that we need that has got our Liberty in it everything's written in there our whole inheritance is written in there and here's the message of the hour I don't know how I got to the ER again but let's just come back now I want to talk about a couple of different forms of liberation that's happened in society is America's liberation America got liberated from free they got they'll be liberated to freedom of religion right but what happened to America is the same thing happened to is they took advantage of their liberty they took advantage of their choice because there wasn't a complete there was the promises you see the Devils so crafty he's so cunning to trick the people and what does he use e uses carnality and last tabata sness and he offers that other with with hybrid religion and what does it do it breaks the people it breaks their minds and breaks their it breaks the power of the Holy Ghost which is keeping the people so here's America they got liberated they got liberated to a new land and they had freedom of religion and now God was using that and building a nation but they took advantage of their liberty and look where they are now spiritually speaking in this the carnal woman's Lib who knows woman's Lib woman's Liberty now that wasn't woman's Liberty it was woman's bondage the devil twisted the minds of the people twisted the minds of females so what they were thinking was their liberation was actually their liberation from eternal life it was their liberation from their godly place a godly position their godly identity they got liberated all right but not for the right for it not for not not good Liberty but you see hallelujah you see that when the tree of knowledge goes does something the tree of life does something to there was also the there was another woman's liberation hey man hallelujah there was a Annalee clay Dee's liberation Amy she got liberated from Satan she got liberated from denominationalism she got liberated from Bennelong heaven hallelujah Amen why that makes me very happy then there was the Jewish liberation and man I watched some of those videos last night and it was sad man the Jewish liberation from all the camps Wow that was heavy real heavy Wow and the things that's it was just disheartening not just happening but just so heavy men Wow like the when they got liberated and those soldiers walked in you know they just the the people was like they were completely like immense at whatever you call it emaciated whatever you call it and just gone to net but they were just I couldn't believe it I you know and they just they were kissing the guards now kissing the soldiers and just hugging them and just couldn't believe it they were just so overwhelmed they were sentenced to death they all just gonna die they were all their families everything was just exterminated and they got liberated louia but there was only a natural Liberty it was only a natural liberation he is a far greater liberation from you see they got taken out of the concentration camp but the concentration camp didn't get taken out of him a lot of those people will even if they're still alive today they're just scarred because you see that the one that can take the liberate the concentration come out of a person they didn't receive they will their children will receive one day soon but you see my point we can be liberated from a circumstance we can be liberated from slavery we can be liberated from Egypt by a prophets message God can take you on the wings of a prophet the wings of an eagle and he can bring you out but what you need to be very certain of God about has Egypt been taken out of you has the slave mentality gone has that culture gone has that casual Christianity gone has that all of those things of Babylon and all the traits that everything that slave mentality has that been taken out are you allowing God to take those things away are you allowing God to work on the deep parts of your life amen what what's God put his finger on in your life what is this finger on right now give it to him lay it down because you see that it'll be that's just the just a little thing maybe I had lay it down because you see sometimes it's those little things that hold a big thing so just lay it all down be an open book you are what you eat they what are you eating amen are you eating the open book you are what you eat you become a reflection of what you eat and if you're in a living epistle written rid of all mean right in your epistle of the open book why people are reading the open word when they read your life people are reading a time they're reading a title deed they're reading a title deed that says that person owns this they might not know it but they're reading ownership theory they're reading this person's gonna rule and reign with Christ a thousand years and then all for eternity hallelujah amen it makes me very happy to think so when you're getting down and when you're getting a pressed and when you're getting challenged and trials and the fiery trial one you're getting liberated Amen you're getting liberated whatever wrote was head around some wrist as burnt amen hallelujah and whatever failure it was that caused the fires of Babylon to engulf you because you're a fellowship with mighty captain amen because you're in fellowship with him this morning because you were eating from his hand directly amen now you might hear it through a voice of a seventh-grade Kentuckian but you had the ricked relationship was with one mighty angel you don't even smell the smoke you don't smell like the smoke in the furnace you're walking around in the middle of it we are walking around in the middle of fire we're walking around and the fires and engulfs you sometimes you were walking in the middle of it all but the fellowship that you are having the book that you're eating the title deed that's in your possession that title deed says you don't smell like the smoke that title D says you are free that title Z says you're on fire that title this is that there is rapturing faith in your life hallelujah that title seat says you have dominion you are a co here with Christ amen that's what it says that's what you're eating that's what people are reading amen I hope you're reading it out of me because I'm reading it out of you amen we're reading each other hallelujah and we're getting encouraged by each other's open book I get encouraged by hearing testimonies amen I get encouraged by reading you Amen Alleluia and so you can see now why it's important to be in fellowship why it's important to be in church why it's important to be dedicated behind the wheel behind the ministry part of the body with vision with a thrust with a fire because you're an open book and that book is people reading and people who's got rapture in faith from reading your life little bit by little bit we're part of this big bonfire together walking together amen fighting together Daniels enemies could could could not say one thing bad about against them it's a testimony a real testimony I want in my life you know to be come to a place where even my enemies let alone my brethren to say they can say nothing been somebody that you know you could go to war with and they wouldn't let you down they wouldn't flip you know that's a soldier's terminology flapping and it's that's when it all gets heated on and the heat goes on and it gets real high pressure and you stay you have that mean you just you strong stay with your comrades your whistle comrades regardless every time every week every day you're there you don't desert you're there man that's a testimony to be there to be here and we are liberated from anything that would be otherwise because we're part all one body we one hope and charity hallelujah people set free set people free did you know that and so your liberty is not just for you to be free your liberty as for others eternal life is living for others and I'll just leave it the eternal life is living for us that's our whole life this is the vision you know I can't describe how blessed we are and I'm sure you know this is a blessed Fellowship amen I'd like to have Church every day Amen hallelujah let's just quit our jobs and have churchy amen we'll grow gardens now amen sing songs mate will have the Babylonian Empire after us for sure they don't want us to do that you know there's people that actually try and live off the land or let and they actually cut it illegal these laws that they have to do this very strict cause if you want to live off the land and be completely separated from the government and the economy and all that stuff actually I will earn it you'd never think it and they probably are countries you can't do it because they don't have much but in a country like this you have to fight to live off the land you have to pay taxes and I don't know what they charge you for but mate you got to pay for probably soil taxes but you actually you can't just do that and that really is pressure sits here and we're closing very shortly Romans 6:4 brethren oh sorry what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein see when you really die to yourself you die to that ambush you die to all about everything everything tiny little thing just now that doesn't mean you're not gonna do anything in your life anymore God will give you back it's just being willing to land or it's being willing to say no you know what whatever you want look whatever you want that's when he can really do a successful work in your life and without that forsaking all you'll never really be a successful Christian you won't have a successful walk with God there will always be a battle there'll always be a turmoil there'll always be hybrid thinking they'll always be tossed to and fro and stability but instability but stability comes from a complete surrender to the Word of God death to self totally did one hundred percent not ninety eight to see the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives but if her husband be dead she is at liberty I mean I like that she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord now i spiritualize this and I believe that the Paul was here as well there is a natural connotation to it but the wife is bound to her old nature the bride was bound to her old nature as long as Sheila but if she be dead she is at liberty to be married to Jesus Christ to be married to the true husband the true grace full of grace and truth hallelujah I can't help but think of Rahab you know she she was married to her old life and all her old husbands and everyone all in their life and she was a prostitute as she was stuck in her life and all the witnesses against her but one day a mighty captain descended down from heaven and his mission they made his mission statement was I want that woman free he didn't say that directly but that's what happened so that was his mission his mission was to free Rahab hallelujah a prostitute someone that was married to all these things and stuck his mission was to set her free she didn't do anything to all she did was believe she received the tape ministry amen she received the two spies that came in with some tapes and gave her some tapes a man if she listened to the wood hallelujah and she she she she surrendered she later all all that old life she laid it all down completely laid it down and what does she get Amen hallelujah she stood there while the grace of God while the mighty angel the open book open the seven seals open the word open the seals and and and the army of the law of the ministry Joshua brother Branham came in and released the word and they obeyed in the church did it stink preach the seven seals seven times and the day at the evening of the seventh day where are we the evening of the seventh day we're right there the captain has an intention he wants us to be completely liberated from everything that ties us to this earth Rahab stands there and all around her normally I shouting with her fish like this but this is just their nice quiet one and it all just crumbles she doesn't have any part to play in that deliverance she just she just came under the subjection to the word believe the word came under subjection to the word and watched her whole life be annihilated around here crumble down by the power of that opening of the word hallelujah and what happens she married the captain a man she married the natural captain you see but this is the glorious thing about Jesus he was writing a prophecy right there he was writing a prophecy because he knew that one day when the when the Rahab of 2017 would be freed from her bondage and sinning or mm I mean we've all been you know we're kind of stretched out over the last however many years I won't go there and we prophesy because you see right around it's right here all crumbles away Babylon the influence of Babylon all of the little things that Babylon offers you Babylon offers us a lot Satan offers the human race so many things all sorts of little trinkets and all sorts of little substances and all sorts of little things that seem so glittery and nice and tasty and whatever it may be all of that crumbles away because the people could tap into a celestial joy they tap into the creator that created joy that created all the chemicals in your body that make you feel joy physically as well when you have him in there with Christ on the vessel I can smile at the store with Christ in the vessel you know it's such a simple thing but man it's a powerful statement with Christ than the vessel abbot Christ's coming into every vessel you see when we met when that word opened in our generation and all under our feet I'll just drop the drop listen hear that mighty angel that stood on the sea and upon the earth he comes down right over us comes into our life and he and he pushes the sea in the earth down to our feet and we stand and have dominion over Rome and all Babylonian religion and over Hollywood and all Babylonian debauchery and all of the influence everything and it goes right down and we stand on it and Dominion to be to be called to his side not to be crushed down under his feet under judgment but to take from his hand and take his hand and walketh your hand in his head into the Garden of Eden it's a Liberty enter to rule and reign with him and while you walk on the road to emmaus he opens and unveils all his word to you and he gives you your identity tells you that you're part of the resurrection not to be worried not to be flustered that you're actually part of him that you're walking with him they all of the things that's worrying you and traveling here is all just a passing thing and you're coming into a complete liberty and perfection and you have faith he's preaching all these things and what's happening if we go back I know there's probably quite a few little pots on the stove right here but we go back to now all of that stuff crumbling away from you all of those things where is it going or crushed down until it's under your feet what happened to Ray head hallelujah a lot of the stuff is just in fresh you know I'm just speaking and and all of Rahab's whole life crumbled around her until she was standing there maybe on a little platform and it was all that was there and they got her she married a natural captain but for us it all crumbles down and that mighty angel comes down and gives us dominion over over all of it complete dominion but we marry Deacon hey man we marry Jesus Christ see Rahab under the blood of bulls and goats could not marry that captain though potentially she would come into his presence but he reserved a greater prophesy for you he resumed the marriage of the land for you and you have come under the same covenant if we could have the musicians please does anyone know the story of arnold von wound club he was the he was the Swiss the Swiss Army was having trouble with the Germans I think it was and Swiss alike you know they're not a big spaceship back in those days probably not a very big nation and they had they didn't have advanced technology I don't even know what year it was but anyway it was it was in the olden days and the Germans come to attack Switzerland you don't take the land and whatever they did or whatever it was the out there another country was coming to attack them and they had advanced weapons and everything and they were going to like the odds were Switzerland was going down basically and this one man Arnold von wenk Lud he said he they're all gathering around and they're gathering together and and they're ready to basically saying their last prayers you know they're all dying they're going and [Music] and Arnold bond went Claude says all right everybody today I die for Switzerland and and basically he said please just tell my wife and my child Bern they won't see me again today I die force what's a little and then when they're already and the armies there and the armies there because they meant on a neutral ground to fight and all of a sudden our old von whant Clark just runs and he charges and he says make way for liberty make way for Liberty and he gave his life for the liberty of his nation and so I encourage you today you can make way for Liberty by giving your life by laying it completely on the altar of God as a living sacrifice living sacrifice not physically give your life but spiritually give your life give everything to make way for Liberty hallelujah it Sam I don't even know what song to sing I didn't think of any bit let's
