[23:57] Thank You musicians I mean praise the
[24:00] Lord hallelujah amen it's good to see
[24:03] everyone out tonight amen if you got
[24:07] your Bibles handle it let's just go to
[24:09] it's got a first first John sort of read
[24:16] a couple of scriptures one from we're
[24:23] just going to stay in the ball just for
[24:25] the opening scriptures will stay in the
[24:26] book of first John and if we just go to
[24:29] chapter two and we'll read verse 27
[24:42] and these are these are familiar
[24:44] scriptures I'm sure but it says now but
[24:48] the anointing which ye have received a
[24:51] femme abideth in you and you need not
[24:53] that any man teach you but as the same
[24:56] anointing teaches you of all things and
[24:58] his truth and there's no lie and even as
[25:01] it hath taught you a chela at it has
[25:04] taught you you shall abide in him and
[25:07] now little children abide in him that
[25:10] when he shall appear you may have
[25:12] confidence and not being ashamed before
[25:14] him at his coming and then let's just go
[25:18] to first John chapter 5 and will read
[25:22] from Justin verse 1 so whosoever
[25:25] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[25:28] born of God and everyone that loveth
[25:30] them that begat loveth him also that is
[25:34] begotten of him by this we know that we
[25:36] love that that we love the children of
[25:39] God when we love God and keep his
[25:40] Commandments well this is the love of
[25:43] God that we keep his Commandments and
[25:45] his commandments are not Grievous for
[25:47] who so what for whatsoever sorry is born
[25:50] of God overcometh the world and this is
[25:53] the victory that overcometh the world
[25:56] even our faith who is he that overcometh
[26:00] the world but he that believeth that
[26:02] Jesus is the Son of God I mean may the
[26:07] lord blesses would you you may be seated
[26:09] I want to I want to just speak tonight a
[26:14] little bit on on overcoming and I just
[26:20] want to take a thought from I thought
[26:23] from the church age book you I've been
[26:25] reading in the Smyrna church age and
[26:28] brother bran begins to speak about faith
[26:31] and there's a there's a scripture to
[26:34] that church age about be thou faithful
[26:35] unto death and then brother Brown would
[26:40] speak about now he does not so be there
[26:42] faithful unto death he does not say he
[26:46] does not say be faithful until death but
[26:49] unto death you may have to seal your
[26:52] testimony with your blood thousands J
[26:55] millions have died
[26:56] all the ages they died in the faith like
[26:59] Antipas the faithful murder they held
[27:01] not their lives dear unto death often we
[27:06] think it would be impossible to be a
[27:08] martyr yeah because we think of you you
[27:10] read who drew the foxes Book of Martyrs
[27:12] you know and you and you hear the great
[27:14] you read the great testimonies of those
[27:16] who who gave their lives willingly and
[27:18] they were tortured and our persecuted
[27:21] that tormented and you know burnt at the
[27:23] stake and you know you know all kinds of
[27:26] horrible things of them yet they gladly
[27:28] rejoice in the in the giving their lives
[27:32] in that way now often we would think
[27:35] that would be almost impossible to be a
[27:37] murder but dare to recall that the faith
[27:41] we daily use to triumph in Christ Jesus
[27:44] as the same faith that upholds the poly
[27:48] cups and all the murders the supreme
[27:51] faith will give supreme grace for the
[27:54] Supreme our blessed be God forever amen
[27:59] so he says he says very simply says the
[28:02] same faith that we have will help will
[28:06] cause us to overcome as they overcame
[28:08] event so when we think of the martyrs we
[28:11] think it would be incredible to you know
[28:13] I don't know if I could you know if I
[28:15] could give my life and and and be
[28:18] tortured like like they did but we
[28:21] forget and I'm just basically rehashing
[28:24] what he said but we forget that the if
[28:26] you have the faith of the Son of God in
[28:29] you amen if you have the same if you
[28:32] have faith in you whatever the challenge
[28:34] comes your way you'll overcome it I mean
[28:38] that's why he says that the you know but
[28:41] we but dare to recall that the faith we
[28:43] daily use to triumph in Christ Jesus as
[28:45] the same faith that upholds the poly
[28:48] cups and all the martyrs so we must
[28:52] rejoice in the fact that we have what we
[28:54] need to overcome the sage amen you know
[28:58] we we see in the book of Acts that there
[29:01] was an anointing that was released you
[29:03] know you're an axe chapter 2 and that
[29:05] anointing you know if you if you go from
[29:08] Genesis even down into this
[29:10] a that anointing upon the children of
[29:12] God has caused them to overcome amen it
[29:15] has caused them to overcome it doesn't
[29:18] matter if they were if they were they
[29:21] had to give their lives as martyrs it
[29:22] doesn't even matter if they had to maybe
[29:25] die of sickness because you know even
[29:27] Elijah Elijah died of sickness he had a
[29:30] double portion of the spirit that was on
[29:32] Elijah but it says in the scripture that
[29:34] that that he he became sick and he died
[29:37] from that sickness but he didn't die in
[29:39] unbelief amen he died in faith and it's
[29:44] a great victory for someone because many
[29:47] times you know we can get it so badly
[29:49] wrong where maybe a a saint has been you
[29:53] know you know cancer has has has jumped
[29:57] on them and many believers are healed of
[30:00] cancer but some are not I meant but it
[30:03] doesn't mean that the ones that die with
[30:05] cancer have any less faith in the ones
[30:07] that are healed because faith to
[30:09] overcome as faith that causes you to
[30:14] believe in spite of your circumstance
[30:16] Amen it causes you because the
[30:19] challenges we have in life are not or if
[30:23] will be healed if we will be delivered
[30:24] as that can you believe in every
[30:26] circumstance I mean can you hold on to
[30:29] God's unchanging hand in every
[30:31] circumstance because if you can hold on
[30:34] to God's unchanging hand in every
[30:35] circumstance then you're overcoming amen
[30:39] and that is the that is the great
[30:41] challenge that we face is that can we
[30:44] overcome this age amen now we talk about
[30:49] great big lofty things as the beast and
[30:51] the world powers and the end and
[30:52] everything the Antichrist is doing sure
[30:55] those things are there but when it comes
[30:57] down to the nitty-gritty of life and how
[31:00] how that that enemy demon power 19 comes
[31:03] down and tries to affect you can you
[31:05] overcome it on that level Amen because
[31:08] you don't have to go storm the Vatican
[31:10] and and wipe them all out or do some
[31:12] great thing like that that's not what we
[31:14] call to do we are called to live a
[31:16] rugged life every day day in day out
[31:19] amen sent it on the centered on the face
[31:23] of the
[31:24] son of God amen but you must understand
[31:27] that the reason I read that scripture in
[31:29] first John to the anointing which you
[31:32] have received of him abideth in you and
[31:35] so the anointing that the bride has
[31:38] doesn't just come upon the months in a
[31:40] while but the anointing that's in them
[31:42] as Christ himself coming and dwelling in
[31:45] your soul a mint and then when when
[31:48] faith is when when the enemy comes to
[31:51] challenge your faith then the then God
[31:53] steps to the battlefront amen it's like
[31:57] brother bear I'm the greatest trial he
[31:58] had in his life was when his first wife
[32:01] hope was dead and then his little Sharon
[32:05] Rose was there on the you know you know
[32:08] dying in the hospital and heap rates you
[32:11] know prayed with all this heart for both
[32:12] of them and then when she was dying you
[32:15] know he was saying God don't take my
[32:18] baby and then the devil came along
[32:21] because remember when he started to pray
[32:22] for just saw a black sheet fall down and
[32:26] you God just refused to hear his prints
[32:27] and then another devil came along devil
[32:31] saying I thought you said he was a good
[32:33] God you know I thought you yo yo yo I
[32:35] thought you see there's a healer and all
[32:37] these different things and then now so
[32:39] here's the greatest crisis of his life
[32:41] and he's come down coming down to a
[32:44] decision yeah because it's where the
[32:47] rubber hits the road Andy and he says I
[32:50] was just about to agree because the
[32:55] devil said to him what have you done you
[32:58] know you've given your life and after
[32:59] you work you go and preach on the street
[33:01] corners you go pray for people you just
[33:02] burn both you know the candle are both
[33:05] in so to speak and look what it's got
[33:07] you he says I was just about to agree
[33:10] but then something on the inside the
[33:12] inside came up and he says honey I'll
[33:15] bury you in the arms of mother which is
[33:17] basically i'm going to put your coffin
[33:18] on you know on top of hers this is the
[33:21] Lord giveth the Lord taketh away blessed
[33:22] be the name of the Lord and that was as
[33:25] great that was the great trial of his
[33:27] faith at that time was it wasn't you
[33:32] know because even says the devil
[33:34] couldn't tell him that God wasn't real
[33:37] it does he really cared as I really love
[33:39] you as it knows you really this good god
[33:41] do you speak about but it was a CD was
[33:43] just about to agree and that's why it's
[33:47] such an incredible thing where this
[33:49] thing can be totally contrary the devil
[33:52] can twist you around who's been there
[33:55] I've been there a few times recently the
[33:57] devil can twist this around but then
[33:59] something on the inside comes out amen
[34:03] and and the man on the inside the inside
[34:06] comes to the battlefront and defeats
[34:08] what Satan is doing a min and that is
[34:11] how you overcome earlier because the
[34:14] anointing which you have received of him
[34:16] abideth in You amen there's a lot of you
[34:20] know I said and I see the book of Acts
[34:23] anointing was was released of God
[34:26] himself putting on human flesh of his
[34:29] redeemed children the Antichrist
[34:30] anointing was released as well in that
[34:32] day and so the two powers were working
[34:35] down through the church but then we have
[34:39] come down to this time and the challenge
[34:44] is because we think sometimes we
[34:46] belittle because you're the reason that
[34:50] jumped out to me about the monitors
[34:51] murders as many times we we belittle
[34:54] what we possess amen because we help
[34:58] hold the martyrs and very high regard
[34:59] and I believe we should incredible
[35:02] worries of faith I'm in which had they
[35:04] didn't have what we have you know they
[35:07] were just plowing along for God not
[35:08] they're not you know they don't have the
[35:10] light that we walk in but sometimes we
[35:13] can belittle what we have and what God
[35:16] has done for us amen we can actually say
[35:19] well I'm just uh I'm just I'm just
[35:21] struggling through you know this lady I
[35:23] see in church age and I'm just going to
[35:25] make it we're not just going to be
[35:27] survivors I mean we're going to be
[35:30] overcomers and you must understand that
[35:32] you know the the anointing the believers
[35:36] of a certain age could only do what the
[35:39] anointing was given for that age a mint
[35:42] so in the days of the book of Acts with
[35:46] the first church that church was called
[35:49] the ephesian church because it aimed at
[35:51] the high quality in Christ but then it
[35:53] relaxed amen that's one of your emphasis
[35:56] means aimed at but relaxed so aimed at
[35:59] the high colleague they had the Holy
[36:00] Ghost but they ended the high calling
[36:02] but then the age began to drift and it
[36:05] began to actually aim towards the Dark
[36:07] Ages where the church was dead and
[36:09] buried underground and the truth was
[36:11] virtually smothered out so they could
[36:14] only they could only live according to
[36:17] what the anointing was to do because
[36:19] they were the first church it wasn't a
[36:21] harvest but there was a quick maturity
[36:24] of the believers but they were actually
[36:26] that was a manifestation to be planted
[36:29] in the ground in the dark ages amen
[36:31] because it was there maybe forgive me if
[36:34] I'm using too much terminology but
[36:36] remember we are wheat we are the harvest
[36:38] a mint so there has been a harvest there
[36:42] has been wheat planted 47 church ages
[36:45] there's been a harvest right but the
[36:48] first church wasn't a harvester terms of
[36:51] taking them into a rapture but the first
[36:53] church had to died and gone to the
[36:56] ground and then come forth again the
[36:58] church had to amen you following me
[37:01] because you see it's it's a harvest I
[37:04] mean I mean it's seed that seed has to
[37:06] be planted if it's play that will bring
[37:08] forth much fruit Amen Jesus spake of bad
[37:11] about himself but you can also see
[37:12] through the church ages that same
[37:14] principle happened so they had to be
[37:16] instead of them going in a rapture
[37:18] because remember when Paul was saying we
[37:20] which are alive and remain shall not
[37:22] hinder those which are dead in Christ
[37:25] but they'll rise first and we were trial
[37:27] on rent we caught up together with them
[37:28] to meet the Lord in the air when he said
[37:30] we which are alive and remain he was
[37:32] writing thinking well as God riding
[37:35] through him thinking that it was we if I
[37:39] was here possible I'd be saying we which
[37:40] are alive and remain so he was believing
[37:43] that they was a group that were going to
[37:44] be there live and remaining ones but
[37:47] that was for us down two thousand years
[37:49] down the road so that first church was
[37:51] aiming at the high calling in Christ
[37:54] they were sealed in because member every
[37:56] age were sealed ins I'm not saying the
[37:58] unbelievers make believers what they
[37:59] were real believers but they couldn't
[38:02] live above what God was anoint
[38:04] the church to do at that time they had
[38:06] to a mat and relax and then gone to the
[38:09] ground eventually and I now as that is
[38:12] the principle in the first stage and you
[38:15] can see the you know we understand that
[38:18] there's been four anointings down
[38:19] through the church has been the line
[38:20] anointing which which is to combat the
[38:22] Antichrist writing forth and then after
[38:25] that when the Antichrist power went from
[38:27] deception so then it finally had had a
[38:29] political power behind it and they could
[38:32] use government with the sword to kill
[38:34] the Christians amen when when the
[38:37] Antichrist went from a deception writing
[38:38] forth so now was the red horse rider
[38:41] with a two-engine sword and that was a
[38:43] time where now the government was behind
[38:45] the false Church and they used a false I
[38:49] mean the false Church used the
[38:50] government to persecute the Christians
[38:53] and so it was a state-sponsored
[38:55] persecution and so the believers and
[38:59] that they were anointed by an ox
[39:01] anointing same Holy Ghost but in a
[39:04] different way and they are anointed and
[39:06] an ox is a beast of sacrifice yep so
[39:10] that's why they could give themselves
[39:11] willingly and joyfully and suffer the
[39:14] great death that they suffered is
[39:16] because they are anointed by an ox
[39:18] anointing amen so they could only live
[39:21] according to the anointing that was
[39:23] given to them I meant they couldn't do
[39:26] anything else are you following me and
[39:29] it's the same thing now when when when
[39:31] Martin Luther came the Reformation came
[39:33] and the anointing of man's wisdom came
[39:35] upon the church and there was great
[39:38] gifted men who knew a lot of languages
[39:39] and all these kind of things is because
[39:42] now but the church could only really
[39:44] operate under that anointing amen and
[39:47] then now you come down to down into our
[39:51] age where where the Prophet tells us
[39:53] when the seals were open the Eagle
[39:55] begins to Firefly so the anointing on
[39:58] the church changes from a man's wisdom
[40:00] anointing amen to now an eagle anointing
[40:04] I mean where there's a people that'll
[40:06] lift it up off the earth amen they can
[40:09] actually saw in heavenly places in
[40:11] Christ Jesus I mean that they can see
[40:13] now what the enemies do it you know what
[40:16] the enemies do it I'm
[40:18] and we can see him a far off amen we can
[40:22] see what he's trying to do and we can
[40:24] see it by the scripture I mean that's
[40:26] why the book of Revelation really is the
[40:29] bride's book Amen because it shows us
[40:32] not only where we are and where we're
[40:34] going but it shows what the enemy is and
[40:36] where he's going I mean so now there's
[40:39] an anointing come upon the church that
[40:40] we can see these things and it's not you
[40:43] know it's the anointing which we have
[40:45] received abideth in you and you need not
[40:48] that any man teaches you but he shall
[40:50] teach you well how does that work
[40:52] because there's because there's teachers
[40:54] in the body well someone will stand and
[40:57] they'll preacher they'll teach and there
[40:59] will be a witness in your heart saying
[41:01] that is true and that and the spirit in
[41:04] you will really put the wood together
[41:05] because ultimately it's just words
[41:07] coming out yep but if the anointing is
[41:11] not here to catch that and put it
[41:12] together then it just sits up here amen
[41:16] that's why you need it so that's why the
[41:18] anointing needs to be on both ends amen
[41:21] so now there's that eagle so so the Holy
[41:26] Ghost and this is why believers we can
[41:30] be we can be maybe you're the devil
[41:33] can try and lay a hold but there comes a
[41:37] time with something and use is now
[41:38] that's him amen because he'll try and
[41:41] trap you with all kinds of things but
[41:44] the Bride of Christ can never be
[41:46] completely entangled again amen amen now
[41:52] so the so the anointing we have received
[41:55] as this Eagle anointing which is that
[41:57] you know and that's why the church you
[42:00] see will Dwight the bright operates
[42:02] differently to how man man aged church
[42:05] used to operate amen that's why it's no
[42:09] more this is my territory this is your
[42:11] territory you stay out of my city this
[42:13] is my you know because that's all man's
[42:15] kind of thinking I mean that's why the
[42:17] breaking come together and it doesn't
[42:19] matter who's there or who's preaching or
[42:21] whatever more that's the same spirit all
[42:23] around the world and they just come in
[42:26] come all into harmony amen because we
[42:30] don't think you know geographic
[42:32] Lee in this well this person's from the
[42:33] Congo and this person's I'd rather
[42:35] listen to someone from America or
[42:37] something yo we don't think that way
[42:39] anymore I trust you don't I meant
[42:43] because it because it's God the same God
[42:45] in the congos the same God in America
[42:47] the same God in New Zealand or whatever
[42:49] country you want to put there and so we
[42:52] can work with other parts of the body
[42:55] amen if the anointing the same anointing
[42:58] that's an us is an M then we can work
[43:02] together and it's not a big guy and a
[43:05] small them or a big demand a small light
[43:07] whatever more the body just all comes
[43:09] together I met under the great headship
[43:12] of the Lord Himself but you see now we
[43:16] cannot live now the reason I said about
[43:19] the former aegis is because the
[43:21] believers you cannot live any other way
[43:25] than what the anointing you have upon
[43:27] you amen so as the first age had to die
[43:34] and go on to the ground the believers in
[43:36] the last stage do not they cannot die
[43:40] and go on to the ground I meant the
[43:43] believers in the last age cannot aim at
[43:46] the high calling in Christ relax and
[43:48] then slide down they have to cause the
[43:51] anointing that's in you you have to aim
[43:53] at the high calling in Christ not your
[43:56] own human ability but there's something
[43:58] in you that's not you pushing you on I
[44:00] met remember this is not if if there's
[44:03] any human instrumentality in your walk
[44:07] but what am I using Wizzle I'm saying if
[44:10] if there's any of you putting your own
[44:12] and put into your Christian walk it is
[44:15] not a Christian walk amen it has to be
[44:21] God and God alone remember you are his
[44:24] workmanship it is not a partnership
[44:27] between you and God saying how we're
[44:29] going to get this going to a rapture
[44:31] amen you are who's the Potter he's the
[44:36] Potter who's the clay you're the clay i
[44:38] mean the the clayton say to the pot of
[44:41] well I think my handle should be this
[44:43] way and I don't really want to be a I
[44:44] want to be a
[44:45] jug I don't want to be a bowl I don't
[44:48] want to be a plane I want to be this the
[44:50] clay doesn't say that to the Potter I
[44:52] mean the clay just yields itself Amy to
[44:56] the potter and the potter makes the
[44:58] claim to what the potter wants it to be
[45:00] and it's the same thing with you and i
[45:03] that's why i may sound ridiculous but I
[45:05] want to say yo it's not a partnership
[45:09] between you and God you yield your
[45:11] members to him and then he does what he
[45:13] wants to do amen and that is the only
[45:18] way member he is the author and the
[45:21] finisher of our faith amen as I see you
[45:25] on Sunday a perfect strength of perfect
[45:27] weakness we have to master human ability
[45:31] amen and that mastering is the
[45:34] realization you your human ability
[45:38] cannot do it amen now don't turn that
[45:42] and took into an excuse poses because
[45:44] God just got angry at Moses I can't
[45:46] speak I have nothing to say they won't
[45:49] hear me you know whatever yo yo has
[45:51] seven excuses whatever it was at the
[45:53] burning bush Moses I mean God didn't say
[45:56] it's all right Moses it's ok we'll be
[45:57] fine he just got angry at him Amen
[46:01] because God wanted Moses to realize I've
[46:04] commissioned you I've heard the cries of
[46:08] our people I have come down and I'm
[46:10] sending you I will deliver them i'm
[46:12] sending you you read nix this chapter 3
[46:14] and so now Moses was trying to bring his
[46:18] human his he was trying to bring what he
[46:24] thought was human weakness and he
[46:27] thought that human weaknesses I can't do
[46:28] the job because of these amen so don't
[46:32] use what you perceive is your weaknesses
[46:35] as excuses amen because God called Moses
[46:40] God then this was God's evaluation of
[46:43] Moses I put the office of a profit in
[46:47] this man he is going to be my mouthpiece
[46:50] I'm going to bring my word through this
[46:52] man i'm going to use him as an
[46:54] instrument to be a serpent bruiser as a
[46:57] shadow amen I'm going to bring my
[46:59] people out of bondage and I'm going to
[47:01] take them to the promised land that was
[47:03] God qualifying Moses a mint and it's the
[47:07] same with you amen I put a previous age
[47:11] seat in my bride Amen I've called them
[47:14] by my name they are mine I'm going to
[47:17] make them in my image Amen they already
[47:20] have what they end they already have in
[47:22] them the power to overcome I just got to
[47:25] bring it to life amen and so we
[47:28] shouldn't say oh Lord I can't speak I
[47:30] can't do this I can't do this just just
[47:33] put that to one side you know perfect
[47:38] strength and perfect weakness is
[47:39] actually really perfect strength is
[47:42] imperfect surrender if you go under the
[47:45] swimmers what he's really talking about
[47:47] and so we cannot live we have can only
[47:54] live by the anointing that we have been
[47:57] given every church age the interpret a
[48:01] time now I may be jumping around but I'm
[48:03] actually speaking on something when you
[48:05] read the seven churches the
[48:07] interpretation of those passages you go
[48:10] see in history yeah see see the ephesian
[48:14] church age you can go read the church
[48:16] history or you know all of them you can
[48:20] hear about you know you can go read
[48:21] about Martin Luther and the Reformation
[48:23] that's the saddest you change amen so
[48:27] the lives that they lived was an
[48:29] interpretation of that church age yep
[48:33] you following me and so now they the
[48:38] life that they lived interpretate was
[48:40] the interpretation of the scripture and
[48:42] so the life that is lived by the Bride
[48:46] of Christ is the interpretation of the
[48:50] bright age amen it is the interpretation
[48:54] of the bride age and we have to
[48:56] understand that when it comes to
[48:59] maturity brother brad says the shock has
[49:02] pulled away and it has all the grain
[49:06] needs to do is lay in the presence of
[49:08] the Sun amen because what often happens
[49:13] is when we think about well am I mature
[49:16] enough who's had those thoughts am I
[49:19] mature enough am I am I really am i
[49:22] growing like the rest of the crop now if
[49:26] you have those thoughts you're trying to
[49:29] work in partnership with God Amen
[49:32] because now you're thinking now I need
[49:35] to put some human ability into this
[49:37] because if people think well I'm not
[49:39] where I should be I'm not mature like I
[49:41] think I should be mature they're
[49:43] thinking now i need to put him human
[49:45] effort into this but the secret is the
[49:48] shock has pulled away the wheat just
[49:52] needs to lay in the presence of the sun
[49:55] to ripen amen what does that what is the
[50:00] Prince of the Sun it's not natural
[50:02] sunlight it's spiritual sunlight amen so
[50:07] when so when we have services or we
[50:10] listen to the word or we pray and God
[50:12] comes what does that now sunlight amen
[50:17] at sunlight had it had it Moses become
[50:20] become root so he was royalty in Egypt
[50:25] and I've said this many times I want you
[50:26] to really think about different way he
[50:28] was royalty in Egypt rim yep the royalty
[50:32] in Egypt consider themselves God's the
[50:35] pharaohs were considered gods in go see
[50:38] it in history so if he was he was going
[50:42] to be the next Pharaoh he would have
[50:44] considered himself a god yep so how did
[50:48] he go and now if someone thinks that you
[50:51] know especially in those days if they
[50:53] think there are God they don't walk
[50:54] around humbly they have a persona they
[50:57] have a you know they walk around like
[50:59] they own the place and the Pharaohs did
[51:02] well that's what they thought how did he
[51:04] go from that to becoming the meekest man
[51:07] in all the earth amen because before the
[51:10] burning bush he wasn't mature amen after
[51:15] the burning bush after Mount Sinai he is
[51:18] very mature because maturity is shown by
[51:21] the character of God and you amen
[51:25] how did he go from that to that he lay
[51:28] in the presence of the Sun amen how'd he
[51:32] land the prisoners on his I Mount Sinai
[51:34] is it the burning bush God came and
[51:37] spoke to him it wasn't Moses is choosing
[51:41] amen at what Mel I'm just just trying to
[51:45] what what does that mean I just sit
[51:46] there and don't do anything know if you
[51:48] love him you want to spend time with
[51:51] them even if you're just driving and
[51:52] talk here in the shopping you're in the
[51:54] supermarket you can talk way to God in
[51:56] your heart or you know go around your
[51:58] daily business you can talk to him you
[52:00] can pray you know you can sing you know
[52:02] Psalms and songs in your heart that's
[52:04] communing with God amen so we shouldn't
[52:08] always get in our mind we have to you
[52:10] know literally well this is my prayer
[52:12] seat and this is where I listen and this
[52:14] is how long I listen all those things
[52:16] are good discipline nothing wrong with
[52:17] discipline but if we restrict God to
[52:19] working in just that Amen will actually
[52:22] miss the rest of the day I need to spend
[52:24] time and he says I'm never leave you nor
[52:26] forsake you amen and so Moses Moses went
[52:34] member it wasn't his choosing he he knew
[52:37] his men to be the delivery but he failed
[52:39] but every time God came to Moses I
[52:42] believe that was God's choosing amen
[52:45] she'll this your night to mean old your
[52:47] night to you but ultimately is God's
[52:50] choosing when he comes amen and so Moses
[52:57] was in the presence of the Sun and he
[53:00] ripened amen and the first five books of
[53:07] the Bible were a revelation to him amen
[53:12] but because he was in the prince of the
[53:15] Sun that would came to him but it became
[53:19] a revelation and that was shown because
[53:21] he became the meekest man in all the
[53:23] earth yeah but but that's what brother
[53:27] and says all we need to do now is lay in
[53:29] the presence of the Sun and it's the
[53:31] sun's work it's not the grains ability
[53:35] in itself to ripen
[53:37] I mean it is the conditions the grain is
[53:40] in amen you take natural that's why
[53:43] Jesus spoke about natural natural
[53:46] parables brother Bram did too because if
[53:49] you look at a grain crop why do some why
[53:52] do some grain harvests a bumper harvests
[53:54] why do some harvest fail it's not the
[53:57] grains fault it's the conditions the
[53:59] greens room Amen if it's sunny and then
[54:02] and the soil moistures right the
[54:04] temperature and all those things are
[54:05] right can you ever bumper harvest a min
[54:08] if it's if it's if it's terrible weather
[54:10] and the worst whatever can do worse
[54:12] season there is you get virtually no
[54:14] harvest it's not the grains fault it's
[54:17] the conditions amen amen well Lord you
[54:25] say well how do you well then you say
[54:28] well I want the conditions to be right
[54:31] amen if you love him I trust I'm not
[54:37] going out on a limb but if you love him
[54:40] you want to spend time with them i said
[54:43] thats everywhere all the time amen so we
[54:47] have to think about everyday things but
[54:50] you shouldn't let that consume you
[54:52] that's all now I've got to think about
[54:54] God now I mean I'm just trying to find a
[54:58] balance here but you understand what I
[54:59] mean amen but if we want to be mature
[55:02] remember what God that's what God views
[55:07] is maturity it's not our self-evaluation
[55:11] amen because it's not the clay that
[55:14] evaluates itself now I'm a pot well now
[55:17] I just need a handle or now I just need
[55:19] a spout or I need a bit of detail around
[55:21] the room to look pretty amen it's not us
[55:25] self evaluating ourselves saying well am
[55:27] i there yet God will have us here when
[55:33] he wants us there amen if he started to
[55:37] work when he finish your work amen
[55:41] remember we cannot live any different
[55:43] now I wonder supper I just want this too
[55:45] I just want you to ponder over these
[55:47] things we cannot we cannot
[55:51] live when he live any definitely only by
[55:54] the anointing that this age is received
[55:57] yeah so they aimed at member let's just
[56:01] go to Ephesians chapter 4 and this just
[56:02] read this because sometimes you know we
[56:09] we can look into the description I know
[56:11] I sometimes do and I just really thought
[56:13] about it this week we look at oh how can
[56:17] we you know we look at the promise but
[56:19] then we think how can we ever obtain the
[56:21] promise but what happens is normally is
[56:25] that a promise is thrown out there and
[56:28] then it's by faith we possess the
[56:30] promise amen but you have to know the
[56:34] promise is there because if you don't
[56:36] know the promises there you'll never buy
[56:38] face say lord thank you it's mine I
[56:40] meant just like the promised land if
[56:43] they didn't know what was in the
[56:44] promised land of the promised land was
[56:46] there there's lights would never you
[56:48] know God amen you know they had to be
[56:52] spies to go this is what the lands like
[56:53] well let's go get it you understand it
[56:57] has to be projected in front of you God
[57:00] puts forth something yep and then he
[57:03] puts that forth because now he's saying
[57:05] I want you to step into this amen he
[57:08] says now is the season and that's the
[57:11] reason he puts it forces because he
[57:12] wants you to walk in it they meant just
[57:15] like thee just like Israel are you
[57:17] following me amen Israel God sends Moses
[57:21] now you're going into the Promised Land
[57:23] or now it's time we've been waiting four
[57:25] hundred years for these things and the
[57:27] reason he's hitting Moses to say now as
[57:29] the seasons because he wanted them and
[57:31] the promised land amen now remember this
[57:37] is the book of Ephesians so this is to
[57:40] thee and not you know just to save time
[57:43] these believers were sealed unto the day
[57:46] of their Redemption so they were
[57:48] believers okay they had the Holy Ghost
[57:53] but now if we read from it's just read
[57:56] from verse 11 and he gave some apostles
[58:00] and some profits and some evangelists
[58:02] and some pasta some teachers
[58:04] for the perfecting of the saints which
[58:06] is a maturing or completeness of the
[58:09] saints not this is not spiritual perfect
[58:12] I mean this is not sinless perfection
[58:13] the blood of Jesus Christ makes us
[58:15] perfect sinless Lee this is speaking
[58:18] this perfection is a maturing a meant
[58:22] for the work of the ministry for the
[58:24] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[58:27] all come in the unity of the faith and
[58:28] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[58:31] perfect man until the measure of the
[58:34] stature of the fullness of Christ there
[58:36] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[58:38] to and fro and carried about with every
[58:40] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[58:42] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[58:44] in wait to deceive but speaking the
[58:47] truth and love may grow up into him and
[58:49] all things which is the head even Christ
[58:51] from whom the whole body gently a
[58:54] jointly sorry body fitly joined together
[58:58] and compacted by that which every joint
[59:01] supply according to the effectual
[59:03] working in the measure of every part
[59:05] maketh increase of the body until the
[59:07] edifying of itself and love so Paul is
[59:12] projecting this is the land we have to
[59:15] go possess we've come here you've been
[59:18] sealed unto the day of your redemption
[59:19] you're in the promised land yep but now
[59:22] we have to go from here and then we have
[59:25] to grow into the fullness of the statue
[59:26] of Christ so but remember they did not
[59:31] fully possess the inheritance because if
[59:34] they did there would have been a body
[59:35] change of rapture amen so there was a
[59:39] there was a portion there is a portion
[59:42] of it that they could not fulfill
[59:44] because they had to be seven Church ages
[59:46] yeah but they are anointed and they
[59:50] could not take the land because there
[59:52] are seven Church ages but now likewise
[59:55] we are anointed but because we're not
[59:58] anointed just a man in to relax were
[1:00:00] anointed that we have to go in and
[1:00:02] possess all things amen we have to live
[1:00:05] out this part of the work you understand
[1:00:09] we have come to a season where the bride
[1:00:12] has to fully possess everything God has
[1:00:15] for them it's like
[1:00:18] when Joshua bought the people into the
[1:00:19] land they didn't fully possess the
[1:00:21] promised land doesn't that right but
[1:00:24] then when David came upon the throne
[1:00:26] then they fully possess the promised
[1:00:28] land yep so there was a season where
[1:00:31] they aimed at it but they couldn't
[1:00:33] possess it but then when David came they
[1:00:36] didn't just aim at it but they possessed
[1:00:38] it amen and they couldn't do anything to
[1:00:41] do that under the kingship of David they
[1:00:44] had to fully possess the land they
[1:00:46] couldn't live any other way yeah and
[1:00:50] it's the same thing in this day we
[1:00:53] cannot know this is not just nice ideas
[1:00:57] amen we have to the believers in this
[1:01:02] day they must possess everything God has
[1:01:05] released to them amen so these things
[1:01:09] that will promise the Ephesians but they
[1:01:11] didn't they didn't obtain it the bride
[1:01:13] has to obtain yes and now the reason
[1:01:18] they say well that's a bit daunting how
[1:01:21] can I ever grow into the measure of the
[1:01:23] stature of the fullness of Christ by
[1:01:26] faith amen by the anointing you have
[1:01:31] received you will grow into them you
[1:01:35] can't do anything else I mean the bride
[1:01:37] can't do anything else it has to grow
[1:01:39] into the floors of the statue of Christ
[1:01:41] and so if that is the case now then just
[1:01:46] by faith thank god you're on your way
[1:01:51] they meant because I said it is not
[1:01:53] human ability or now I need to be more
[1:01:56] like Jesus and then if you if you go
[1:01:58] down a work throat you just end up
[1:02:01] legislating yourself by your perceived
[1:02:03] failures you must never do that amen
[1:02:08] just walk with God lay in the Prince of
[1:02:11] the Sun amen and you'll mature amen is
[1:02:18] it really that simple yet us as we walk
[1:02:22] in the light as he is in the light we
[1:02:24] have fellowship one with another ice in
[1:02:26] God and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:28] cleanse us from all sin first shot first
[1:02:30] John 17
[1:02:31] amen but then also as you walk in the
[1:02:34] light the light ripens the green amen so
[1:02:40] as the as the bride walks with Christ
[1:02:43] you mature amen I'm just trying to
[1:02:49] hopefully I just take a better self
[1:02:52] ability load off here today amen just
[1:02:56] rest in him and walk with Him amen oh
[1:03:01] but the rapture may happen and I don't
[1:03:03] feel like I'm mature God will get you
[1:03:07] there just walk with god and if some
[1:03:12] people are having a glorious time and
[1:03:14] you don't seem to be feeling it just
[1:03:16] walk with God and if you're having a
[1:03:18] glorious time and no one else is feeling
[1:03:20] it just walk with God amen enough urine
[1:03:23] and the in-between time just walk with
[1:03:26] God Amen because remember it's not you
[1:03:29] the church in God it is you and God amen
[1:03:36] and every member i trust every believer
[1:03:39] that comes into this place it is them in
[1:03:41] god and it should always be that way
[1:03:43] it's not us as a body in him and by
[1:03:46] association we walk with them no it's
[1:03:49] not it's not their weights an individual
[1:03:50] fits you and God amen and as you walk
[1:03:53] with Him you will mature amen and now
[1:04:03] you say well what is that got to do with
[1:04:06] overcoming if you walk with him whoever
[1:04:13] is born of God overcometh the world yeah
[1:04:18] so those I think we should just order a
[1:04:22] Joyce from that one scripture whoever is
[1:04:24] born of God overcometh the world doesn't
[1:04:28] maybe overcome or attempts to remember
[1:04:30] overcome mr. wrestle with and get the
[1:04:32] victory they meant so whoever is born of
[1:04:36] God overcomes the world what does that
[1:04:39] mean believer verse world equals well
[1:04:43] defeated believer overcome
[1:04:46] amen that's the what happened in this
[1:04:49] war the believer overcame how they
[1:04:51] overcome because our born of God amen
[1:04:56] amen it is not you know as I see it you
[1:04:59] just got to take the scripture for that
[1:05:01] says I'm going to try and close on this
[1:05:02] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:05:08] the world amen can I say it one more
[1:05:12] time should we say it together for
[1:05:16] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:05:20] world amen who is born of God that means
[1:05:26] you overcome the world amen amen
[1:05:30] hallelujah and this is the victory that
[1:05:34] overcometh the world even our faith amen
[1:05:38] so your faith gives you victory amen but
[1:05:43] if you're born of God you have to
[1:05:45] overcome the world this is what we just
[1:05:46] read I can't you just make it sound a
[1:05:50] lot more exciting it is what it is amen
[1:05:53] if you are if you're born of God you
[1:05:55] overcome the world it's not a few born
[1:05:58] of God you fail and are defeated in this
[1:06:01] age or you just survive this age no you
[1:06:04] overcome the safe wrestle that means
[1:06:07] you're wrestle Worth and you get the
[1:06:08] victory amen and overcometh it means
[1:06:13] it's a it's past tense Amen overcometh
[1:06:18] is past tense yeah overcometh it's done
[1:06:23] it's not overcoming the world present or
[1:06:26] shall overcome it's overcomer if my King
[1:06:30] James English is correct that is isn't
[1:06:33] it past tense yeah okay they have
[1:06:40] overcome yo they overcome a thought do
[1:06:42] it it's done amen because if you're born
[1:06:46] of God you cannot become unborn of God I
[1:06:49] need some musicians to come otherwise
[1:06:51] we'll be here too long but you could
[1:06:53] understand you cannot you cannot be
[1:06:55] unborn you get born again but you cannot
[1:06:59] go
[1:06:59] from being born again to become unborn
[1:07:02] amen you can't it's impossible amen you
[1:07:10] understand so if you've been born of God
[1:07:16] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:07:18] the world I think that is actually
[1:07:21] present in sorry but it's finished amen
[1:07:26] obviously my my King James English isn't
[1:07:28] that good but it is what it is amen so
[1:07:35] put that on your fridge say put that
[1:07:38] scripture on your frigid and say I have
[1:07:40] been born of God that means I overcome
[1:07:44] amen and that is the victory even our
[1:07:47] faith many times we yeah well we fight
[1:07:50] battles all kinds of things all the time
[1:07:52] but you got to remember my faith because
[1:07:55] if you're born again it is not your
[1:07:57] human faith operating as a faith of the
[1:07:59] Son of God in you amen so it's his faith
[1:08:03] in you operating you understand so that
[1:08:07] means it doesn't matter come what may is
[1:08:10] that faith as in you and that faith will
[1:08:12] cause you to overcome Amen Alleluia
[1:08:19] let's just sing faith turns the night
[1:08:22] into the day amen is it okay the bride

[1:08:35] rapture cuz she can't do anything else
[1:08:37] amen the bride has to walk out
[1:08:40] victorious because we can't do anything
[1:08:41] else because that's the anointing that's
[1:08:43] upon us I'm malicious sickness faith
[1:08:48] turns a night into the day
[1:08:53] love drives a doubts and fears away and
[1:08:58] now my heart is singing Oh with the door
[1:09:06] bells ringing all this to the peeling of

[1:10:51] all that he ha allu you so I becometh as
[1:10:59] a verb it means to subdue literally or
[1:11:03] figuratively to conquer to overcome to
[1:11:05] prevail to get the victory amen Amy do
[1:11:10] not belittle what you have amen amen as
[1:11:15] he said I just want to read that again
[1:11:20] he says but did see often we think that
[1:11:24] it would be almost impossible to be a
[1:11:26] murder but there to recall that the
[1:11:29] faith we use that we daily use to
[1:11:31] triumph in Christ Jesus is the same
[1:11:33] faith that upholds the poly cups and all
[1:11:37] the martyrs the supreme faith will give
[1:11:40] supreme grace for the Supreme our
[1:11:42] blessed be God forever amen amen so so
[1:11:47] whatever challenge remember whatever the
[1:11:50] enemy tried to do through the ages the
[1:11:53] faith and the believers caused them to
[1:11:55] overcome amen so whatever the challenge
[1:11:59] comes against you the faith in you will
[1:12:03] cause you to overcome Amen hallelujah
[1:12:10] Amen let's just um it's just closing a
[1:12:13] word of Prayer shall we gracious Lord we
