[45:44] let's turn to the book of Corinthians
[45:46] first Corinthians chapter 2
[45:48] a couple of places like to read this
[45:52] morning first Corinthians 2 and verses 6
[45:59] down to verse 16 and then we're going to
[46:01] go to the book of Philemon so 1st
[46:07] Corinthians 2 and 6 it says howbeit we
[46:11] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[46:13] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[46:16] the princes of this world that come to
[46:18] naught but we speak the wisdom of God in
[46:21] a mystery even the hidden wisdom which
[46:24] God ordained before the world unto our
[46:26] glory which none of the princes of this
[46:28] world knew for had they known it they
[46:30] would not have crucified the Lord of
[46:32] glory but as it is written eye has not
[46:34] seen nor ear heard neither have entered
[46:36] into the heart of man the things which
[46:39] God has prepared for them that love him
[46:41] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[46:44] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[46:46] things yea the deep things of God for
[46:49] what man knoweth the things of a man
[46:51] save the spirit of Man which is in him
[46:53] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[46:56] but the Spirit of God now we have
[46:59] received not the spirit of the world but
[47:01] the Spirit which is of God that we might
[47:03] know the things which are freely given
[47:05] to us of God which things also we speak
[47:08] not in the words which man's wisdom
[47:11] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[47:13] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[47:15] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[47:17] not the things of the Spirit of God for
[47:20] they are foolishness unto Him neither
[47:22] can he know them because they are
[47:24] spiritually discerned but he that a
[47:26] spiritual judges all things yet himself
[47:29] as judged of no man for who has known
[47:33] the mind of the Lord that he may
[47:35] instruct him but we have the mind of
[47:38] Christ amen and let's go to Philemon
[47:41] we're going to read verses so it's only
[47:43] one chapter we're going to read verses 5
[47:46] to 2:7
[47:54] they means this is here and and Philemon
[47:58] verses 5 to 7 it says now hearing of thy
[48:02] love and faith which thou has towards
[48:04] the Lord Jesus and towards All Saints
[48:07] that the communication of thy faith may
[48:09] become a fiction by the acknowledging of
[48:12] every good thing which is in you in
[48:15] Christ Jesus if we have great joy and
[48:18] consolation and thy love because the
[48:20] bowels of the saints are refreshed by
[48:22] the brother amen may the Lord bless the
[48:25] reading of his word you may have your
[48:27] seats this morning so I'd like to
[48:29] continue on from from last Sunday
[48:32] speaking about the word manifested and
[48:34] we have read here you know we yeah we
[48:38] read here and Philemon I want to take
[48:40] this mainly as a as a thought but you
[48:42] know see is that the communication of
[48:44] their faith may become a fictional by
[48:47] the acknowledging of every good thing
[48:49] which is in you in Christ Jesus so we
[48:52] have to come to a place where we you
[48:53] know if we want our faith the other
[48:55] communication of our faith to become a
[48:58] fictional or the offer to become
[48:59] powerful we have to acknowledge or to
[49:02] come to a full understanding of every
[49:04] good thing that's within us which is in
[49:06] Christ Jesus
[49:07] so you know I believe that we're living
[49:09] in a day where the it is the you know it
[49:12] is the revealing of the manifestation of
[49:14] the sons of God this is an adoption Ages
[49:16] as where the bride comes to her position
[49:18] in Christ you know where it's more than
[49:20] just looking for a promise to come but
[49:23] we actually obtain the promise right so
[49:26] you know we so we want out you know who
[49:28] wants their faith to be effectual who
[49:30] are your faith to be powerful you know
[49:31] to manifest itself so in order to do
[49:34] that we must acknowledge and and that
[49:36] would acknowledge to be which is which
[49:39] means recognition that is to come to
[49:41] fooled discernment or full
[49:43] acknowledgment of what sin you see so we
[49:46] must come to a full recognition of what
[49:48] is in you and we know that in our
[49:50] humanity there's no good thing you know
[49:51] this is not what for your what has been
[49:54] written to fill them on here he's not
[49:56] being told to look at your own humanity
[49:57] your your carnal nature and look at
[50:00] what's good
[50:00] that but what's in you that is good by
[50:02] Jesus Christ being in you right so
[50:04] because we know brother perhaps is a
[50:06] deity is not in heaven it's in you
[50:08] rights and I see everything that's in
[50:10] Christ all that God poured into crises
[50:12] poured into you right so now so we need
[50:15] to look at what is in us and we must
[50:17] recognize what's in us and we have to in
[50:20] order for our faith to be official to be
[50:22] powerful we must acknowledge every good
[50:24] thing that's in you in Christ Jesus
[50:26] right this is very important because we
[50:28] are knotted the bride is not downtrodden
[50:30] right we're not just scraping by we're
[50:33] overcoming why the bride is called to
[50:35] overcome it's not to him that survives
[50:37] will I sit will they sit on my throne as
[50:40] I've set my Father's throne as to them
[50:42] that overcomes but and we are more than
[50:44] conquerors through Christ that loved us
[50:46] more than conquerors not just getting
[50:48] buyers not a close-run thing we're going
[50:50] to walk out of this world victorious
[50:52] we're gonna walk out world overcoming
[50:54] then the devil will have zero on the
[50:56] scoreboard and will win right so now we
[50:58] need to acknowledge what is within us
[51:00] and we should end and the more you
[51:02] should see Christ in you the more you
[51:03] should worship Him and the more thankful
[51:05] for what he's done for you right if we
[51:07] really if the bride really new really
[51:09] come to a full recognition of what God
[51:11] has done for you would be on our knees
[51:13] screaming thanking God every day it
[51:15] would not make us proud it would not
[51:17] make us arrogant it would make us more
[51:19] humble yielded thankful people because
[51:22] we know it is not our work we are not
[51:24] our own work right we're not here to to
[51:26] establish her own selves upon the earth
[51:28] but God would live that he would
[51:31] manifest himself he would there be no
[51:33] hindrance there be nothing stopping you
[51:35] know him living and and you know I
[51:37] didn't really wrap it all up on your
[51:39] last Sunday but I said you know you know
[51:42] you shouldn't have any walls between you
[51:44] and God and you shouldn't have walls
[51:46] with you in you and your parents I see
[51:47] you know sometimes we can have because
[51:49] of bad relationships we can put up walls
[51:51] but you know don't don't apply the same
[51:54] relationship you have with your dad as
[51:55] you have work with God as they you
[51:57] shouldn't have walls between you and
[51:59] your parents no matter how they've
[52:00] treated you right because remember
[52:03] complex our wall while he hinders God
[52:05] living out of years
[52:06] it doesn't hinder the other person is
[52:08] tenders God living out of you
[52:10] right so you know we shouldn't have a
[52:12] wall against anyone all right so we need
[52:15] to you know it says in first John four
[52:17] and four year of God little children and
[52:20] have overcome them because greater is He
[52:23] that's in you that he that is in the
[52:25] world so he says here you have overcome
[52:27] them
[52:28] the victories already won right we just
[52:30] need to enjoy it I mean so now we have
[52:33] to come to a and I believe we're living
[52:35] in a season where you know brother
[52:37] Branham would say and in crisis the
[52:40] mystery of God revealed he says so it's
[52:42] Christ expressing himself in the
[52:43] individual with these intellectual with
[52:46] he doesn't know as ABC's half the
[52:48] Apostles didn't know that's right but
[52:50] they knowed Christ they never taken heat
[52:52] to Peter and John knowing that they came
[52:54] out of some seminary they said they have
[52:57] taken heat and noticed that they had
[52:58] been with Christ whether healed the lame
[53:00] man see at the gate they knowed they'd
[53:03] been with Christ and the new birth is a
[53:05] revelation Christ our God has revealed
[53:07] you this great mystery it's a new birth
[53:09] now that's what you are going to do I
[53:12] mean now what are you going to do when
[53:15] you get all that group together with the
[53:17] revelation is imperfectly in harmony and
[53:19] God expressing it through his word by
[53:22] the same actions the same things he did
[53:24] making the word manifest he says Oh of
[53:27] the church only knew its position at
[53:29] will one day then the rapture will go
[53:32] when it knows what it is right so you
[53:35] know so so he's so he's saying if the
[53:38] church only knew its position not if the
[53:40] church would come to that position but
[53:42] it would only if it only knew its
[53:43] position and it will one day know there
[53:46] so that one day has to come I believe
[53:48] we're living in that one day we're
[53:50] living in the season where it's not in
[53:52] the future but its present right so now
[53:54] so when we know our position in Christ
[53:56] what he has done for us right then the
[53:58] rapture will go when it knows what it is
[54:02] right and we know the bride is part of
[54:04] the bridegroom she is the Word made
[54:06] flesh right so this has to go from here
[54:09] and
[54:10] it has two anchor down into our souls
[54:12] amen he says in Revelations chapter 1
[54:15] 1960 says he says now my church will get
[54:19] cut Lucy washed us and loosed us from
[54:21] our denominations in his own blood
[54:23] and has made us free so we can think for
[54:26] ourselves do for ourselves talk for
[54:28] ourselves act for our self well if I
[54:30] went back and told the pastor I had to
[54:32] be rebaptised he would what about it
[54:34] you're free this is a revelation you
[54:36] know all all right you're free have you
[54:39] been sprinkled with look with a little
[54:41] salt shake like this in the name of
[54:42] Father Son Holy Ghost is a pool sitting
[54:44] here ready this morning with water at
[54:46] sea yes sir it's not right so you're not
[54:50] bound anymore you're free but maybe you
[54:52] don't know it but let me tell you this
[54:55] morning the Bible said is loosed us from
[54:57] our sins our unbelief that we might
[54:59] receive the revelation of Jesus Christ
[55:02] go away free right have to take what any
[55:06] Church is about it take what God says
[55:07] about it here's this revelation
[55:09] revealing who he is
[55:10] as always believed that God was the
[55:14] father a long white beard white here the
[55:16] son was a middle-aged man and the Holy
[55:17] Ghost was a mascot boy brother it's
[55:19] paganism it's pagan if you believe in
[55:22] three gods the very first commandment
[55:23] what is the first commandment he or
[55:25] Israel I'm the Lord your God is one God
[55:27] that's it he's one God not three gods he
[55:30] lived in three officers Amen base but
[55:33] you know so he said now you're free but
[55:36] maybe you just don't know it if you have
[55:38] to come to realization we have real
[55:39] Liberty we have freedom in Christ we're
[55:41] actually free from the bondage of
[55:43] unbelief how our sin nature we are born
[55:46] with we don't carry that no more if
[55:48] you've been born again what we have been
[55:50] made free but maybe we don't know it so
[55:52] we're going to come to a full
[55:53] recognition that we're free hallelujah
[55:56] not just a little bit free we're
[55:57] completely free if he has loosed us by
[56:00] his blood
[56:00] I mean that we are loosed we are free
[56:03] hallelujah there's been a full jail
[56:04] break hallelujah we're out
[56:06] amen we're free now so as I saying that
[56:11] now we've come to eight we've come to a
[56:13] cease and we're where this is an
[56:16] adoption season where now we yeah yeah
[56:20] let's just go to Luke chapter 15 I just
[56:21] want to go through a few things
[56:23] but this is the story and and I trust
[56:25] you all know it well of the of the
[56:28] prodigal son now we read this here and
[56:31] and well let's just read it because I
[56:35] trust when you read such stories you you
[56:37] can see yourself in the scripture
[56:39] hallelujah and so we're just going to
[56:41] jump partway through through here and he
[56:44] sees from we're just going to read from
[56:45] verse 17 I mean say I mean when you're
[56:48] there he says and when he came to
[56:53] himself he said how many hired servants
[56:56] of my father's have bread enough and to
[56:58] spare and I perish with hunger and I'll
[57:01] arise and go to my father's hand and
[57:02] father I've sinned against heaven and
[57:04] before thee and I'm no more worthy to be
[57:06] called thy son make me one of thy hired
[57:09] servants and he arose and came to his
[57:11] father but when he was yet a great way
[57:13] off his father saw him had compassion
[57:15] ran and fell on as Dickon kissed him and
[57:18] his son said unto him father I have
[57:19] sinned against heaven and in thy sight
[57:21] and no more worthy to be called thy son
[57:23] but the father said unto his servants
[57:25] bring forth the best robe put it on him
[57:28] and put on a ring on his hand and shoes
[57:30] on his feet and bring hither the fatted
[57:32] calf and kill it let us eat and let us
[57:34] eat and be merry for thy for this my son
[57:37] was dead and is alive again he was lost
[57:39] that is found and they began to be merry
[57:41] so now we so the prodigal son he was
[57:47] restored he was redeemed back to his
[57:50] rightful position by his father as the
[57:52] father's doing right here is the one
[57:54] that decreed remember the prodigal son
[57:56] he had in his heart I'm not worried
[57:58] because the son anymore just be a
[57:59] servant but the father did not want his
[58:02] son to remain a servant he wanted him to
[58:04] be fully restored or edie back to what
[58:07] he was before he left father's house
[58:09] right so he was he was redeemed restored
[58:12] back to his rightful position in the
[58:14] family right and this was shown by by he
[58:17] he received thee you know he received
[58:20] thee the best robe right wasn't just a
[58:24] robe was just a change in raiment that
[58:26] was the best one right and we know that
[58:28] we're living in an hour where we're
[58:30] where we have come to the marriage of
[58:32] the Lamb right there's a people upon the
[58:34] earth that have been United with
[58:36] heavenly bridegroom right we're living
[58:38] in marriage season living a time with is
[58:40] a union has taken place a minute Caesar
[58:43] and his wife has made herself ready and
[58:45] to her she was grounded should be
[58:47] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[58:48] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[58:50] of saints right so that is the best robe
[58:53] I mean the righteousness of saints is
[58:56] the best room right so so he was a rate
[58:58] in the best robe and not only that but
[59:00] but a ring was put on his finger now we
[59:03] know in the scripture and it's the same
[59:05] in like the medieval times you know when
[59:07] a king would sign something at the law
[59:09] he'd take his ring which had his coat of
[59:11] arms I'd have put it in the wax and seal
[59:13] it on the bottom of that of that
[59:15] document saying this is me all of my
[59:17] authorities behind this piece of writing
[59:20] hallelujah and so now he's been given
[59:23] the rope so he's as righteous as the
[59:25] father is righteous I mean we are as
[59:28] righteous as God is righteous right
[59:30] we're not less righteous than him and
[59:32] the bride is as righteous as he is
[59:34] righteous we're as holy as Jesus is holy
[59:37] amen I fear if we're being redeemed we
[59:39] join here's with Christ
[59:41] we've been lifted up to his safe equal
[59:43] position with him I'm talking about
[59:47] every good thing which is in you in
[59:48] Christ Jesus
[59:49] you had to acknowledge it hallelujah so
[59:51] now so so he was given a ring and that
[59:55] ring we know in the scripture where it
[59:57] says that you know you know the ring
[1:00:00] always carries the Kings Authority and
[1:00:03] we see this in the book of Esther after
[1:00:05] Esther has you know Heyman's scheme has
[1:00:08] been exposed he's been hung on his own
[1:00:09] gallows but then but then after that the
[1:00:12] the ring that was given to Haman now is
[1:00:14] placed in eastern Mordecai's hands and
[1:00:16] then now they have the right to to write
[1:00:19] whatever they wish amen and to seal it
[1:00:22] with the king seal that it's exactly the
[1:00:24] same as if the king wrote it now
[1:00:26] personally I mean and signed up with his
[1:00:28] own seal so it's the same as as as ister
[1:00:31] was writing that it was exactly the same
[1:00:33] as if the king was writing it right so
[1:00:35] now so it sees an Esther eight and seven
[1:00:38] assists in king of has receipt on the
[1:00:39] east of the Queen and to Mordecai the
[1:00:41] Jew
[1:00:41] well hold I have given s to the house of
[1:00:43] Haman and and him they have hanged upon
[1:00:46] the gallows because they because he laid
[1:00:48] his hands of
[1:00:49] on the juice he says right he also for
[1:00:51] the juice as it like ahthe you in the
[1:00:53] King's name and seal it with the King's
[1:00:55] ring for the writing which is written in
[1:00:57] the King's name and sealed with the
[1:00:59] King's ring may no man reverse police so
[1:01:03] now they received the authority whatever
[1:01:05] you write he says just write it seal it
[1:01:07] with my ring publish it abroad
[1:01:10] hallelujah so now it's the wind from a
[1:01:13] transition where she was a wish you was
[1:01:16] a orphan and Mordecai's house and then
[1:01:19] she became the queen but now she exeed
[1:01:21] was given the authority to exercise
[1:01:23] everything the Queen hat yo could could
[1:01:26] exercise you following me so because
[1:01:28] we're where she was afraid to go and
[1:01:30] before the king right there wasn't too
[1:01:32] much longer after that where the king
[1:01:34] said whatever you say write it down seal
[1:01:36] it and see it at home and this is the
[1:01:38] position that Easter was placed in it's
[1:01:40] the same thing with the Bride of Christ
[1:01:42] we're gonna understand that we've been
[1:01:43] given the signet ring of God holy that
[1:01:46] we have authority in the kingdom not the
[1:01:48] way greater than him but his will must
[1:01:49] be manifested upon the earth I mean
[1:01:52] that's why I read we have the mind of
[1:01:53] Christ yo yeah we're brother EV sees
[1:01:56] that the bride knows what he wants done
[1:01:58] with his word and because the same - and
[1:02:00] him as in you
[1:02:01] right sir so what he does with his word
[1:02:03] you know what he wants done because it's
[1:02:05] a - a news right it's not a different
[1:02:08] mind we don't have a different mind and
[1:02:09] different opinion we have his opinion
[1:02:11] his mind right so what has attitude we
[1:02:13] have the same attitude
[1:02:14] I mean his heart towards your the lost
[1:02:17] we have the same heart right his heart
[1:02:20] towards the devil we have the same
[1:02:21] height as well right hallelujah I mean
[1:02:25] so you know everything he is his nature
[1:02:27] we received that nature we have we are
[1:02:29] partakers of the divine nature yes and
[1:02:32] that's why I trust when you look look at
[1:02:34] yourself and look where you've come from
[1:02:35] you should be able to see the nature I
[1:02:37] once had on no longer have
[1:02:39] I may still be living in this list but
[1:02:41] my hostas are when it boils down I mean
[1:02:44] what what you love I love what unit
[1:02:46] tastes itit it I can't help but I've
[1:02:49] just been Reaper bread
[1:02:50] I've been rewired I can't I can't change
[1:02:53] myself hallelujah
[1:02:55] that's why when the Apostle Paul you
[1:02:58] know let's go to Holly let's go to first
[1:03:01] Corinthians shall we first Corinthians
[1:03:03] 13 amen
[1:03:11] you know it's amazing it's amazing when
[1:03:15] you can look into the scripture and you
[1:03:18] read and you begin to find out the life
[1:03:21] that you've just read about has already
[1:03:23] been in you right it's amazing isn't it
[1:03:26] you know it's like yeah I think it was
[1:03:29] your Peter Peter and the Apostle Paul
[1:03:32] after how many years Paul was preaching
[1:03:34] I don't know off the top of my head but
[1:03:36] they came together they found it they
[1:03:38] are preaching exactly the same thing
[1:03:39] right so maybe Peter could put it in the
[1:03:42] scripture like Paul could but the same
[1:03:44] things he taught though teaching exactly
[1:03:46] the same thing right and so you know and
[1:03:49] so you can see where yeah you know
[1:03:51] because really what it is is you burst
[1:03:53] into the kingdom and you know your and
[1:03:55] brother Brahim sinners like you are in
[1:03:57] turn to a great arcade everything
[1:03:59] belongs to you you don't know exactly
[1:04:01] what's on the top shelf in the back
[1:04:03] aisle but it's for you right and you
[1:04:06] begin to fighter as you go through the
[1:04:08] scripture that the life that's in you
[1:04:10] right yeah you yeah it's living and then
[1:04:13] you begin to find out actually it's in
[1:04:15] here because the same spirit that wrote
[1:04:17] the word is in you right it's like the
[1:04:19] book of Ephesians you know they've been
[1:04:21] birthed into the kingdom they have the
[1:04:23] Holy Ghost is sealed to the day of their
[1:04:24] Redemption then the Apostle Paul begins
[1:04:26] to tell them Christ's position and their
[1:04:28] position in Christ and how they must
[1:04:30] withstand the enemy and and and and with
[1:04:33] it going right so they're already in the
[1:04:36] kingdom but they are the Apostle Paul
[1:04:39] says no this is your position in crisis
[1:04:41] is what he's done for you and now you're
[1:04:42] going to grow into the fullness of
[1:04:43] statue of the perfect man
[1:04:45] how look so you know isn't anyway first
[1:04:49] Christmas xxx amen let's read from verse
[1:04:53] four he says in charity divine love
[1:04:56] suffereth long and is kind charity
[1:04:59] envieth not charity vaunteth not itself
[1:05:02] is not puffed up now you should be able
[1:05:04] to I trust when when we you know when
[1:05:07] this is being read there's something and
[1:05:09] you says this is in me right this is the
[1:05:12] section of the nature I receive this is
[1:05:14] not the nature I had but there's the
[1:05:16] nature I have received when I truly met
[1:05:18] the Lord right does not behave itself
[1:05:21] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:05:23] easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoice
[1:05:27] us rejoice us not an iniquity but
[1:05:30] rejoices in the truth beareth all things
[1:05:33] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:05:36] endureth all things
[1:05:37] charity never faileth but whether there
[1:05:40] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[1:05:42] there be tongues they shall see through
[1:05:43] there'll be knowledge it shall vanish
[1:05:44] away for we know in part we prophesy in
[1:05:47] part but then that which is perfect is
[1:05:49] come then that which is part shall be
[1:05:52] done away then when I was a child I
[1:05:55] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:05:57] I thought as a child but when I became a
[1:05:59] man I put away childish things for now
[1:06:02] we see through a glass darkly but then
[1:06:04] face to face now I know in part but then
[1:06:07] I shall know even as also I am known
[1:06:11] now this is the day we're living in
[1:06:12] right that we should know as we are
[1:06:15] knowing and now abideth faith hope and
[1:06:18] charity these three but the greatest of
[1:06:20] these is charity I mean say you can see
[1:06:23] here you know when when you know when
[1:06:26] the Apostle Paul is describing charity
[1:06:28] and how it manifests it's not just
[1:06:30] something nice to put on the fridge I
[1:06:32] mean you should see it in your life
[1:06:33] right you should see this manifested
[1:06:36] because the words to put on flesh right
[1:06:37] so you should see that you know in you
[1:06:39] that you beareth all things believeth
[1:06:41] all things hopeth all things and we know
[1:06:43] hope and the Scriptures actually
[1:06:44] expectation it's not a stab in the dark
[1:06:46] hope there's actually expectation I mean
[1:06:49] so it's really you're expecting all
[1:06:50] things hallelujah and jerath all things
[1:06:54] Amen does not behave itself unseemly
[1:06:56] seeketh not her own is not easily
[1:06:58] provoked thinketh no evil Elias I trust
[1:07:01] that that mind is in you Amen to know so
[1:07:05] so the protocol son was redeemed by the
[1:07:08] father and he was placed back to his
[1:07:10] rightful position in the family now this
[1:07:13] was done because the son had to be
[1:07:16] restored back so he could run his
[1:07:19] father's business right hey yo he wasn't
[1:07:22] given a robe and a ring just to float
[1:07:24] along and and and live in the family
[1:07:26] home but the father wanted him back in
[1:07:29] his rightful position that the son could
[1:07:31] operate his father's business the same
[1:07:34] way the father would yes right it's the
[1:07:36] same thing with us you know we are being
[1:07:38] called we have been redeemed for a
[1:07:41] purpose right and nothing the devil
[1:07:44] cannot take you alive until your purpose
[1:07:46] is done what nothing can stop the devil
[1:07:49] cannot take your life doesn't matter how
[1:07:51] sick you may be how bad you may feel the
[1:07:53] devil can't take you until God has
[1:07:55] finished with you upon the earth
[1:07:57] hallelujah so we could I mean we can
[1:07:59] just say and I believe the devil can't
[1:08:01] take us until God has done hallelujah
[1:08:04] this isn't Feast of the trumpets this is
[1:08:07] now what is it done the cunningness is
[1:08:09] he said he cometh in like flatteries and
[1:08:11] what has he done he's bringing the price
[1:08:12] and ecumenical council of the world
[1:08:14] churches the spirit of Antichrist upon
[1:08:17] both him bringing them to the slaughter
[1:08:18] just like just like they did in there
[1:08:22] and sorry just like they did the other
[1:08:25] in an hour to call a bride how loose the
[1:08:29] ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon
[1:08:31] what not upon denominations upon the
[1:08:33] bride but here you'd get at the bride
[1:08:35] will not go through that time speak of
[1:08:37] the Great Tribulation right the Bible
[1:08:39] says not the church will but not the
[1:08:41] bride see his ministers can't you see
[1:08:43] that brethren you say the church has to
[1:08:45] go through the persecute persecution for
[1:08:48] the perfection of it the blood of Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ prefix the bride a man who
[1:08:52] chooses a wife don't put her through a
[1:08:54] lot of punishment he's already found
[1:08:57] grace with her she's found grace with
[1:08:58] him he engages to her and if there's
[1:09:01] anything he'll keep her from every place
[1:09:03] to turn her head his grace is so great
[1:09:06] upon them
[1:09:07] and so will it be upon the bride and so
[1:09:10] does on the bride
[1:09:12] we unworthy creatures deserving of hell
[1:09:14] but as grace holds us through it lookie
[1:09:17] how many lost and blind
[1:09:19] how many sinners was there in the world
[1:09:21] there I got saved God saved me for a
[1:09:24] purpose and I'm determined by his will
[1:09:26] to do that purpose however you think
[1:09:29] about how many people how many billions
[1:09:31] upon the earth the day you met him he
[1:09:33] met you but he did it for a reason right
[1:09:35] he didn't just do it just to give you a
[1:09:37] religious it you're a religious way of
[1:09:39] being but he saved you he called you he
[1:09:41] spoke to you he revealed his word to you
[1:09:43] for a purpose right that you had
[1:09:46] manifest whatever path the word is you
[1:09:48] had manifested right whatever part of
[1:09:50] the body you're called to be in right so
[1:09:52] now the son was redeemed back to his
[1:09:54] rifle position and he was done that he
[1:09:56] was he was redeemed by the father that
[1:09:58] he could take over the father's business
[1:10:00] right that we're brother Brahim says
[1:10:02] when her son has adopted into the family
[1:10:04] that his name on the check is as good as
[1:10:07] the father's right so his name his name
[1:10:10] on the check is exactly the same as if
[1:10:12] the father wrote the check right because
[1:10:14] they have the same mind right they have
[1:10:16] the same ambition hallelujah so now here
[1:10:19] we are saying that we are not you know
[1:10:21] we are saved for a purpose we need to
[1:10:24] find what their purpose is amen to know
[1:10:27] and so so here we are we you know we
[1:10:30] have the robe
[1:10:31] we're ready arrayed right we already had
[1:10:34] the robe fine linen clean and white the
[1:10:36] righteous of saints we're right
[1:10:37] right we don't get the right there we
[1:10:39] get the robe here I mean we we have the
[1:10:42] adoption Road right we have the ring
[1:10:44] that's why your we shouldn't shrink back
[1:10:46] for the devil so we should we should use
[1:10:48] our god-given Authority we may not have
[1:10:51] the power but we have the authority just
[1:10:53] like a policeman on the street he gave
[1:10:55] me the little bitty a smallest man I
[1:10:56] mean but those trucks have to stop you
[1:10:59] know for him when he goes on the street
[1:11:00] because all the city is as behind that
[1:11:03] policeman I mean he doesn't have the
[1:11:05] power to stop it but he has the
[1:11:07] authority I mean usually going to show
[1:11:09] the devil you're bad you believer and
[1:11:11] say push back devil get off the street
[1:11:13] oh Jesus Christ get out of here and he
[1:11:15] has to listen to you that's amazing how
[1:11:18] the devil you know he made humans fall
[1:11:20] he made humanity fall but then God
[1:11:23] redeems us amen and then the devil
[1:11:26] thinks you know he doesn't you know he
[1:11:28] doesn't want to listen to God he says
[1:11:30] I'll do it my way and then because
[1:11:33] humanity to fall and then God takes this
[1:11:36] human this this fallen humanity redeems
[1:11:40] it but we're still in these fallen
[1:11:41] bodies and then now a voice that once
[1:11:44] Parker Singh and glorified the devil
[1:11:46] those same lips tell the devil way to go
[1:11:49] say looks actually cast evil out the
[1:11:52] same lips bring God down maybe the same
[1:11:55] lips bring Redemption to others less
[1:11:57] aimless bring the Holy Ghost oh my gosh
[1:12:00] hallelujah I'm glad it's that way don't
[1:12:02] you and the devil has to obey your voice
[1:12:05] even the devil has to by the bride's
[1:12:08] voice hallelujah that's not now poor mr.
[1:12:11] devil could you please in the area will
[1:12:12] this be convenient for you
[1:12:14] no kick him out what up with Satan we
[1:12:21] here to Tormentum and in these kind of
[1:12:23] boom I mean why why not give him more
[1:12:27] sleepless nights I'd never be sleepy you
[1:12:29] know what I mean we mother stretch them
[1:12:30] out holy he should be happy to see you
[1:12:34] scarred
[1:12:34] I'm glad those people are gone now I can
[1:12:36] really do what I wanted ish amen
[1:12:40] now we understand that we do not become
[1:12:43] sons by the new birth right we do not we
[1:12:46] do not become part of God's family by
[1:12:48] the new birth but we are born again
[1:12:50] because we are sons right says in
[1:12:52] Galatians now I'm just men we're just
[1:12:54] going through a few things you've got to
[1:12:55] acknowledge all the good things in you
[1:12:57] in Christ Jesus
[1:12:58] right hallelujah you know it's like you
[1:13:01] know it's like someone who wants to find
[1:13:03] gold you know they may look at a hill
[1:13:05] and we look at the same hill and and and
[1:13:08] we say well there's no real value in
[1:13:10] that mountain but they know because of
[1:13:13] their training and the exploration they
[1:13:15] know Gold's there yeah right and because
[1:13:17] they see the gold under there and a lot
[1:13:20] of times you're going to move a lot of
[1:13:21] rock to get a bit of gold it takes a lot
[1:13:23] of effort but but a miner knows I
[1:13:26] to get that gold there's value in that
[1:13:28] goal all of the labor and the effort is
[1:13:30] worth it
[1:13:31] I mean to get the gold doesn't matter
[1:13:33] how much of the rock you got to move
[1:13:35] how much machinery got to buy whatever
[1:13:37] you gonna do they know it's there and
[1:13:39] they want to get it right and it's the
[1:13:41] same thing with you we're a bunch of
[1:13:43] rubble right but there's gold in you
[1:13:46] right there's gold in you I mean cuz we
[1:13:49] for this is we have we have a jean seat
[1:13:52] from before the foundation of the world
[1:13:54] that's there so there's gold there right
[1:13:57] there's gold right and now the great
[1:13:59] miner comes along our Lord Jesus and
[1:14:01] looks in you and says it's worth it
[1:14:03] that's why when he died on Calvary right
[1:14:06] he's it's worth because I want to get my
[1:14:08] gold I want to get parts of me I want to
[1:14:10] refine them on and bring them out
[1:14:11] hallelujah amen sorry because he sees
[1:14:15] Valley on you he saw value you may not
[1:14:18] see much value in yourself the devil
[1:14:19] sure doesn't think there's anything
[1:14:20] worthy in you right he just thinks
[1:14:23] you're a bunch of cannon fodder or
[1:14:24] slaves or whatever it is but God sees
[1:14:26] part of himself God sees us bright God
[1:14:29] sees us a lik lady arrayed in a Zemin
[1:14:32] you're made in His image hallelujah so
[1:14:35] you know sometimes we're gonna look at
[1:14:36] ourselves and say well Lord you you saw
[1:14:38] some value and me and it's what you see
[1:14:41] in me that matters it's not what I see
[1:14:43] it's what you see yeah amen
[1:14:48] holy I'm glad he saw something in me now
[1:14:54] I say this is Galatians 4 and 1 now I
[1:14:56] say that the ear as long as he is a
[1:14:58] child differeth nothing from a servant
[1:14:59] though he be Lord of all
[1:15:01] but as under tutors and governors until
[1:15:03] the time appointed of the Father even so
[1:15:06] we when we were children were in bondage
[1:15:08] under the elements of the world for in
[1:15:10] the fullness of the time was come God
[1:15:11] sent forth the son made of a woman made
[1:15:13] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:15:15] under the law that we might receive
[1:15:17] adoption of sons now we know adoption
[1:15:20] and the Bible's the placing of a son
[1:15:22] placing on the son and a family right
[1:15:24] it's not it's not bringing someone into
[1:15:26] your family that's not a blood relative
[1:15:28] right it's not one of your children you
[1:15:31] know it's not like going to China
[1:15:32] getting a Chinese baby bring it to the
[1:15:34] family writing some paperwork and saying
[1:15:36] now you're part of the family no it's
[1:15:38] the placing of a child that's been born
[1:15:40] into the family rights and now so that
[1:15:43] we might receive the adoption or the
[1:15:45] placing of sons and because he our sons
[1:15:48] because he our sons right not because
[1:15:51] you became sons but because he are I
[1:15:53] trust us means something to you and
[1:15:55] because you are sons God has set forth
[1:15:57] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:15:59] crying Abba Father I mean on my father
[1:16:02] my father you come to realize you know
[1:16:03] who your father really is not just your
[1:16:06] natural father but your heavenly father
[1:16:08] hallelujah and if you know who your
[1:16:10] father is you begin to conduct yourself
[1:16:12] differently because you know who your
[1:16:13] father is
[1:16:14] hallelujah wherefore there are no more a
[1:16:17] servant but a sudden of a son then an
[1:16:19] heir of God through Christ hallelujah so
[1:16:24] now if so that's why the message you
[1:16:26] heard the voice behind the voice what
[1:16:28] you heard that voice a supernatural
[1:16:29] voice is because God is speaking to you
[1:16:31] you're my son you my daughter I don't
[1:16:34] want you to be a servant now I want you
[1:16:35] to be a child in my kingdom I want you
[1:16:38] to be placed in the family hallelujah
[1:16:40] that way no more no more a servant but a
[1:16:42] son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:16:44] through Christ oh yeah
[1:16:47] Amen so this is the hour where we're
[1:16:49] living in the adopts this is an adoption
[1:16:51] age this is where everything comes to
[1:16:53] its position yes right the devil comes
[1:16:55] to his position of godless evil age the
[1:16:58] church come to us position right here
[1:17:00] but the bride comes to her position and
[1:17:02] that's the main thing we should be
[1:17:03] focusing on amen you know because God
[1:17:07] ultimately the real time peace upon the
[1:17:10] earth is the bride we know God sees as
[1:17:12] roles you know Israel is God's timepiece
[1:17:14] the Prophet said it but God's waiting
[1:17:16] for us to come to our place right he's
[1:17:18] waiting for us and when we come to our
[1:17:20] place in the rapture we'll go when the
[1:17:22] church knows what it is then the rapture
[1:17:24] will go so it's very important we know
[1:17:27] who we are
[1:17:28] amen now the scripture tells us because
[1:17:34] sometimes you know we can look at this
[1:17:35] and say well will I ever make it to my
[1:17:38] placing in the kingdom well seasoned
[1:17:40] Ephesians 1 and 5 he says having
[1:17:41] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:17:44] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:17:46] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:17:49] will to the praise of the glory of His
[1:17:51] grace your and here
[1:17:52] made us accepted in the beloved so we
[1:17:54] are predestinated unto the placing onto
[1:17:57] the adoption of children right we have
[1:18:00] our destiny as predetermined yes that's
[1:18:02] our final resting place thats our in
[1:18:05] destination upon this earth as we are
[1:18:07] placed in the body of Christ as a joint
[1:18:09] ear hallelujah Amen glory to God now the
[1:18:16] scripture also tells us you know a trust
[1:18:18] you don't mind all the reading but it
[1:18:21] says in Romans 8 that the that the
[1:18:23] creation is groaning it's under it's
[1:18:26] under expectation for the manifestation
[1:18:30] of the sons of God so the creation is
[1:18:34] under expectation amen
[1:18:37] waiting for the manifestation or the
[1:18:39] revealing that word manifestation is the
[1:18:42] revealing so it's waiting this world is
[1:18:45] waiting for you to come to your place
[1:18:47] it's under expectation it means to not
[1:18:51] just we're under expectation for a
[1:18:52] rapture and gods under expectation
[1:18:54] nature's under expectations Amy I don't
[1:18:57] know how nature thinks but it's
[1:18:58] obviously groaning I mean how the world
[1:19:01] is being pulled upon destroyed and
[1:19:03] polluted there must be a burden of
[1:19:04] nature when are we going to be delivered
[1:19:06] of this holiest when yes why brother
[1:19:09] brems in Colorado he speaks a storm out
[1:19:11] of existence and the deer come out of
[1:19:13] the bush I mean maybe they were there
[1:19:15] saying Adam is this you is this you Adam
[1:19:18] have you been redeemed hallelujah I
[1:19:21] don't know but you know maybe oh but
[1:19:23] this world is under expectation waiting
[1:19:27] for the revealing of the sons of God and
[1:19:29] that's what this message does it reveals
[1:19:31] sons and daughters of God hallelujah
[1:19:35] amen for the creature for the creation
[1:19:38] was made subject to vanity not willing
[1:19:40] but by reason of him who has subjected
[1:19:41] the same and hope because the creature
[1:19:44] itself shall also be delivered from the
[1:19:46] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[1:19:47] liberty of the children of God for we
[1:19:50] know that the whole creation groaneth
[1:19:52] and travaileth and pain until now and
[1:19:54] not only they but ourselves which have
[1:19:57] the firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:19:59] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:20:01] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:20:03] of our body
[1:20:05] amen now we're just going to go on to
[1:20:10] touch something but he says here and so
[1:20:13] so this is from the church age book
[1:20:15] chapter 1 he says now remember this
[1:20:17] Christ and the true church is a
[1:20:19] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:20:21] book of Revelation shows that how the
[1:20:23] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:20:25] church and defile it make it lukewarm
[1:20:27] formal and powerless it exposes Satan
[1:20:30] revealing his works attempted
[1:20:32] destruction of God's people and the
[1:20:34] discrediting of God's Word right down to
[1:20:36] the time that he has cast into the lake
[1:20:38] of fire
[1:20:38] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:20:40] knows that if the people get the true
[1:20:42] revelation of the true church and what
[1:20:45] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:20:47] she can do the greater works she'll be
[1:20:49] an invincible army if they get the true
[1:20:51] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:20:53] framework of the Christian Church and by
[1:20:55] God's Spirit discern and withstand the
[1:20:57] Antichrist spirit
[1:20:58] Satan will be powerless before her he
[1:21:00] will be definitely thought of today as
[1:21:02] when Christ was stood as every effort to
[1:21:04] gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:21:06] Satan hates revelation but we love it
[1:21:09] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:21:11] gates of hell could not prevail against
[1:21:13] us but we will prevail over them and
[1:21:15] that's why I say we should have a burden
[1:21:17] for revelation like this world doesn't
[1:21:20] want you to dig into the word this world
[1:21:22] does not want you to dig into the riches
[1:21:25] of Christ right because we read through
[1:21:26] in the beginning the spirit just a deep
[1:21:28] thing right so we and and the devil
[1:21:31] that's why the devil he hates revelation
[1:21:33] right but he hates that revelation and
[1:21:35] you rights is not just a bunch of
[1:21:38] knowledge yo-yo he hates the word being
[1:21:42] revealed to a people that's what he
[1:21:44] hates so hates that we in Revelation
[1:21:46] puts on flesh right where it's more than
[1:21:48] affirmation becomes a reality he cannot
[1:21:51] stand that because he knows when when
[1:21:53] when when you know the word becomes a
[1:21:56] revelation he'll be defeated because
[1:21:58] maybe the scripture doesn't only just
[1:22:00] reveal Jesus Christ it reveals you right
[1:22:03] and if you know who you are in him then
[1:22:05] you'll be then you'll be victorious
[1:22:08] lujah he says also if you were you will
[1:22:11] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:22:13] of this message that this book we are
[1:22:15] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:22:17] Jesus himself and the church
[1:22:19] and his works in the future ages then I
[1:22:22] mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:22:24] to give us revelation or we will fail to
[1:22:26] get it bringing these two thoughts
[1:22:28] together you'll see that it won't just
[1:22:30] take an ordinary study and thinking to
[1:22:32] make this book real it's going to take
[1:22:35] the operation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:22:37] means this book can't be revealed to
[1:22:39] anyone but a special class of people it
[1:22:42] will take one with prophetic insight it
[1:22:44] will require the ability to hear from
[1:22:46] God and will require supernatural
[1:22:48] instruction not just a student comparing
[1:22:51] verse with verse though that is good but
[1:22:53] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:22:55] Spirit or it never becomes clear how we
[1:22:57] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[1:22:59] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[1:23:02] hear and know so you see that's only
[1:23:04] revealed to a spiritual group of people
[1:23:06] holy holy are you saying that's not me
[1:23:10] to the others why so I'm just glad I
[1:23:11] want a husband God depends which side
[1:23:14] you're looking at right so we'll take an
[1:23:16] operation of the Holy Ghost amen in
[1:23:19] order for it to be revealed and it will
[1:23:21] require the ability to hear from God
[1:23:23] this is not the prophet hearing from God
[1:23:25] that's you why cuz it's going to become
[1:23:27] a living reality to you I mean so now we
[1:23:31] know the book of Revelation is the
[1:23:32] bride's book hallelujah that's our book
[1:23:35] right but now once you just do now I
[1:23:38] heard brother Duane awesome meeting this
[1:23:40] free people to go but deeper into it
[1:23:42] he's now brother brems he has five
[1:23:44] things here right he says so the devil
[1:23:48] cannot stand it he says he knows that if
[1:23:50] the people get the true revelation of
[1:23:52] the true church that's the first one and
[1:23:54] what years that's a sick of one watch he
[1:23:56] stands well that's the third one and she
[1:23:58] can do the greater works that's the
[1:24:00] fourth one she will be an invincible
[1:24:02] army and if they get the true revelation
[1:24:04] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:24:06] of the Christian Church that's the fifth
[1:24:07] one and by God's Spirit discern and
[1:24:10] withstand the Antichrist but Satan will
[1:24:12] be powerless before her right so we need
[1:24:14] to understand the true revelation of the
[1:24:17] true church right and what she is it's
[1:24:20] important you know what you are right
[1:24:22] you're not from this earth you're from
[1:24:23] heaven are you just going through this
[1:24:26] but a Heki of time back injury
[1:24:28] hallelujah and so and what she stands
[1:24:31] for we need to know what we stand for
[1:24:33] and that she can do the greater works
[1:24:35] right we're living in the age of the
[1:24:36] greater works right she will be an
[1:24:39] invincible army if she get if they get
[1:24:41] the true revelation of the two spirits
[1:24:43] within the framework of the Christian
[1:24:44] Church and by God's Spirit discern and
[1:24:46] withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan
[1:24:48] will be powerless before her right so no
[1:24:51] we understand you know as as brother
[1:24:54] Brahim says in the unveiling of God when
[1:24:56] he when he went into a there was a steel
[1:24:59] manufacturing place and at the end of
[1:25:02] the day you know everyone got off the
[1:25:03] floor they swept all of their trimmings
[1:25:05] and stuff from there you know they're
[1:25:06] doing their lathes work you know and
[1:25:08] then it all stepped away
[1:25:10] you know slipped it onto the floor they
[1:25:11] push a button the magnet pulled it up
[1:25:12] and they've got taken over and it got
[1:25:15] melted over it got made over again to
[1:25:17] whatever they're making raw material
[1:25:19] it's it's like trimmings that fell off
[1:25:21] the Bible Bible Christians right so he's
[1:25:24] saying that the your the the believers
[1:25:26] are like trimmings of the word that have
[1:25:29] fallen off upon the hallelujah so now
[1:25:33] you've got to really come to it you know
[1:25:35] you know your he tells these stories
[1:25:36] they're not just nice stories it's great
[1:25:38] dip from these stories he's trying to
[1:25:40] get you to see speaking about a
[1:25:41] roundabout way he's trying to get you to
[1:25:43] see now you're out of this world what
[1:25:46] you're actually part of the scripture I
[1:25:47] mean you know just someone who is here
[1:25:49] just to be a bystander or you know just
[1:25:51] just stand on the grandstand and cheer
[1:25:53] someone on even to find out you become
[1:25:56] the prophecy but you become the word
[1:25:58] right it's just like the two on the way
[1:26:00] to Emmaus during the Resurrection season
[1:26:03] they didn't know they were part of that
[1:26:04] resurrection season they had to go to
[1:26:06] the upper room right there was part of
[1:26:08] the resurrections right so they're
[1:26:10] walking with Jesus Jesus opened the word
[1:26:12] for six hours there has been within them
[1:26:13] as he spoke maybe but he was trying to
[1:26:15] get them to see all the scripture that
[1:26:17] was fulfilled in their day right that
[1:26:19] not only was he the resurrection but
[1:26:21] they were part of that resurrection
[1:26:23] right so they the fullness of that
[1:26:25] wasn't just now they there were there in
[1:26:27] some class you mean you know they were
[1:26:29] just walking with them that he would
[1:26:31] tell them stuff about just him right he
[1:26:34] he had to open the scripture to see
[1:26:36] without living the day now now living
[1:26:38] right but then they had to not only say
[1:26:40] well that was
[1:26:40] for home but then to go in the upper
[1:26:41] room and become part of that
[1:26:43] resurrection and that's why the Lord
[1:26:45] opened the scripture to them that they
[1:26:46] would understand their part of his
[1:26:47] resurrection but the part of hermas he
[1:26:50] raised their race hallelujah right there
[1:26:53] once did interest you know did and sins
[1:26:55] and trespasses they became a life oh and
[1:26:59] it's the same thing now we're brother
[1:27:01] Brahim speaks and you know you know he
[1:27:03] uses Luke 24 mondo beads to make clear
[1:27:06] by prophecy a saying that's a prophecy
[1:27:08] right he's saying but if as a prophecy
[1:27:10] he's going to be a fulfillment right so
[1:27:12] now here and then and then he's here
[1:27:14] he's saying well Jesus is here my
[1:27:16] ministry is declare that he is here
[1:27:17] right he's here in Word form right and
[1:27:20] they're now and in the scripture comes
[1:27:21] open and it means a lot to us when he
[1:27:24] goes to Genesis 18 it doesn't mean a lot
[1:27:26] to other people means a lot to us it
[1:27:28] means a lot when he opens to the woman
[1:27:29] of the world and see it now it's just
[1:27:31] like that time and history's repeating 7
[1:27:34] and I'll turn my back like Sarah was
[1:27:35] behind Ella him you know in the 10th
[1:27:38] I'll turn my back and all the same
[1:27:39] what's in the heart right because he's
[1:27:42] placing you in the scripture he's
[1:27:44] placing what the Lord is doing but he's
[1:27:45] placing you right there you had come to
[1:27:48] an understanding it's not just a prophet
[1:27:49] discerning the heart I mean but there's
[1:27:51] a word has come that those people will
[1:27:53] be changed just like Sarah was changed
[1:27:56] after their visitation she was changed
[1:27:58] she could have the promised son
[1:27:59] hallelujah and now here we are we have
[1:28:01] been changed alright we've received a
[1:28:04] new birth we're being born again maybe
[1:28:06] then we can meet the promised son in the
[1:28:07] air now these bodies will be changed
[1:28:08] right oh yeah maybe it's a no he's so
[1:28:12] that's why I went with it on the way to
[1:28:13] Emmaus that they would come to an
[1:28:15] understanding they're part of the
[1:28:16] fulfillment of the word and their day
[1:28:18] right that's the same thing God comes
[1:28:20] among us the message is more than just
[1:28:22] preaching or supernatural ministry but
[1:28:24] Jesus Christ revealing himself to you
[1:28:27] right and then you begin to understand
[1:28:29] your part of the fulfillment of Malachi
[1:28:31] 4 right because they said I will send to
[1:28:34] you who's used who's I God who's you and
[1:28:36] me Elijah the Prophet wasn't it turned
[1:28:38] my heart back to the original faith
[1:28:40] hallelujah
[1:28:42] all ready go you find your part of the
[1:28:44] scripture you you say well my name is
[1:28:46] not in the Bible but what I'll do is in
[1:28:47] the Bible
[1:28:48] write hallelujah glory to God Amen so
[1:28:53] now the true revelation of the true
[1:28:55] church the true church is part of him
[1:28:58] right this is not a larger just a
[1:29:00] gathering you know the message isn't
[1:29:02] just to make a church the message is
[1:29:04] actually to gather God's bride yeah
[1:29:06] there's attributes together and one
[1:29:08] redeemed body right that's the true
[1:29:11] church that the true revelation of true
[1:29:13] church just like Paul says in 1st
[1:29:15] Corinthians 11 you know how many are
[1:29:16] sick and weak among you you know because
[1:29:18] they didn't discern the Lord's body so
[1:29:21] we have to have spiritual discernment
[1:29:23] when we look at each other see I see the
[1:29:25] word in flesh
[1:29:25] I see part of them I see mrs. Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ why that's discerning the Lord's
[1:29:30] body and what she is yeah it's very easy
[1:29:36] to say we're we have brother Berenices
[1:29:37] let's just find it over here and the
[1:29:39] rising of the Sun he says no matter how
[1:29:43] much the dynamics proved to be right
[1:29:45] it's got to be a dynamic to make it work
[1:29:47] and that's what he proved hallelujah
[1:29:49] that's what Easter proved he wasn't only
[1:29:51] the word but he was God himself the
[1:29:52] dynamics in the word that made the body
[1:29:55] of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in
[1:29:57] the grave shake it into life rise again
[1:29:59] roll them roll away the stone I am he
[1:30:01] that was dead so dead till the Sun City
[1:30:04] was dead the moon shed he was dead the
[1:30:06] star City was did all they just said he
[1:30:08] was dead and now the whole world has to
[1:30:10] recognize that he's alive again he's not
[1:30:13] only the mechanics God's Word he was the
[1:30:15] dynamics to prove it
[1:30:17] and as he being the groom the bride has
[1:30:20] to come forth because it's part of him
[1:30:22] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:30:25] the fulfilling of all revelation any
[1:30:27] others has spoke of the bride it can
[1:30:30] only manifest if it does something
[1:30:32] different from the groom it is in the
[1:30:34] bride because she is the flesh of his
[1:30:36] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[1:30:39] power is power
[1:30:40] she is him as man and woman are one and
[1:30:43] a woman has taken from a side she was
[1:30:45] tight I'm she had taken a spirit and
[1:30:48] feminist spirit from him the flesh from
[1:30:50] a side made both mechanic and dynamic
[1:30:53] the wife the spirit
[1:30:55] of him and the flesh of him and put it
[1:30:57] together and made mechanic and dynamics
[1:30:59] until the church or the people all these
[1:31:02] Easter Bunny ceremonies big churches
[1:31:03] finery will fail and pass away until
[1:31:06] that church becomes both dynamics and
[1:31:09] mechanics and the Spirit of God that
[1:31:11] moved him to do the things that he did
[1:31:13] if he hit 16 cylinders so will the bride
[1:31:16] amen for he said in John 14:12 he that
[1:31:20] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:31:21] shall he do also I've given him a charge
[1:31:24] of my dynamics and his mechanics that
[1:31:26] the world will not be able to withstand
[1:31:28] it and I'll race him again in the last
[1:31:31] day that's the Easter message the
[1:31:33] dynamics and the mechanics together the
[1:31:35] mechanics without the dynamics no good
[1:31:37] neither is the dynamics without the
[1:31:39] mechanics he says you can scream and
[1:31:41] shout jump up and down all you want to
[1:31:42] deny this were word it won't do any good
[1:31:45] you're just cranky around the Pistons
[1:31:47] that the sparks got the fire but no
[1:31:49] guests in the fire I bye
[1:31:50] hallelujah Amen so now right you know
[1:31:53] with the bride has the mechanics in the
[1:31:55] dynamics the bride is the whole package
[1:31:58] right we're not lacking anything our
[1:32:00] Lord hasn't left us as a widow with
[1:32:01] nothing we lack have no thing I mean we
[1:32:04] have all things we need in his word
[1:32:06] hallelujah so we can just rejoice but
[1:32:09] when he says that she is him that's just
[1:32:11] three words but it means a whole bunch
[1:32:13] Amen when you you know we got to
[1:32:16] understand what we are we're part of her
[1:32:18] right we're not something he's just yo
[1:32:21] you know we know just someone who's just
[1:32:23] picked up somewhere but we're part of me
[1:32:24] see is all that the father has given me
[1:32:26] will come to me and all that comes me
[1:32:29] all no wise cast out hallelujah so I'm
[1:32:31] glad amen now what do we stand for we
[1:32:42] stand for the faith once delivered to
[1:32:43] the Saints we stand for God dwelling in
[1:32:46] a people brought this well this missus
[1:32:48] does it produces Christ and a people the
[1:32:51] word the fullness of the word is
[1:32:52] manifested in a multi-member body right
[1:32:55] as the scripture says until he until
[1:32:58] you're we're that would be filled with
[1:33:00] the very fullness of God's everything he
[1:33:02] is will be filled with it right all of
[1:33:04] us nature's character everything he is
[1:33:06] not just a
[1:33:07] portion like in previous ages but the
[1:33:09] fullness enter people Amen brother
[1:33:12] Brahim says now he sees in the feasts of
[1:33:14] the trumpets he sees that the holy
[1:33:17] spirit has been bound by these dominant
[1:33:19] denominational rivers for almost 2,000
[1:33:21] years but it is to be loosed in the
[1:33:23] evening time by the evening time message
[1:33:26] the Holy Spirit back in the church again
[1:33:28] Christ Himself revealed in human flesh
[1:33:30] in the evening time he said it he
[1:33:32] promised it she sees of this because the
[1:33:34] pure Word of God releases the Spirit of
[1:33:36] God upon the people right well
[1:33:39] hallelujah so now this so the Holy Ghost
[1:33:42] that was bound by the Creed and dog was
[1:33:44] of man that's been done away with has
[1:33:46] been loosed by the entire message right
[1:33:48] as John the Baptist he was authenticated
[1:33:51] by Jesus coming and being baptized by
[1:33:53] him he was the vindication of his
[1:33:56] ministry right hallelujah and if that
[1:33:58] was the first coming as John the Baptist
[1:34:01] for around the first come here Christ
[1:34:02] saw the Ministry of brother brand will
[1:34:04] forerun the second coming so what is the
[1:34:06] authentication of his ministry is that
[1:34:08] the Lamb of God was introducing God has
[1:34:11] and his people right they see us
[1:34:13] indication that God has put on flesh
[1:34:15] again enough evil that is the proof of
[1:34:17] the message yes that is the proof it's
[1:34:19] not about clothes and bridges and
[1:34:21] whatever more the proof of them remember
[1:34:23] the message is God and his people right
[1:34:25] because if it's the pure Word of God it
[1:34:28] looses the Holy Ghost upon the people
[1:34:30] and the Holy Ghost comes and dwells in
[1:34:31] them amen and that's what this message
[1:34:34] is done the Holy Ghost is being loosed
[1:34:36] hallelujah that we're not looking for
[1:34:38] something else to come it's come it's
[1:34:40] already here the were discovered salutes
[1:34:42] the Holy Ghost hallelujah that's why now
[1:34:44] there's no hindrance there's nothing to
[1:34:46] stop it and then there's no channel
[1:34:48] blocks I mean everything's come open
[1:34:50] that he can just pour himself out
[1:34:51] hallelujah I'm so glad that it's all
[1:34:54] right I happen to believe it the word is
[1:34:57] loosed right the Holy Ghost is being
[1:34:58] loosed upon us hallelujah I mean you see
[1:35:02] John came introduced Jesus that produced
[1:35:05] a book of Acts right I produced a true
[1:35:07] Pentecost which which produced a book of
[1:35:09] Acts and when we have Malachi 4 come
[1:35:11] introduce Jesus Christ the Living Word
[1:35:14] brought us to a true Pentecost
[1:35:15] true Pentecost makes call coming to our
[1:35:17] little people and it's now writing a
[1:35:19] book of Acts
[1:35:20] hallelujah I'm in it history repeats
[1:35:23] itself what quite wonderfully amen and
[1:35:26] that she can do the greater works amen
[1:35:29] we are called to do the greater works
[1:35:30] that's why we can't as I see it but in
[1:35:32] the beginning don't shrink back to the
[1:35:33] devil right but we can do the greater
[1:35:36] works amen
[1:35:38] and she will be an invincible army now
[1:35:41] as I've said in the past an invincible
[1:35:43] army has to be have to have combat
[1:35:46] experience those on the parade ground
[1:35:48] and shiny armor they've never tested
[1:35:51] those weapons they just march around the
[1:35:53] square looking fancy right but those who
[1:35:55] are being battered and beaten and
[1:35:56] bruised and your goth are a few battles
[1:35:58] and their armors been dent then said
[1:35:59] they're proved those weapons and they've
[1:36:01] come out victorious twice in order to be
[1:36:03] invincible you have to go through battle
[1:36:06] hallelujah amen and if they can get a
[1:36:11] true revelation and now I've gone to
[1:36:13] these things that are in a greater way
[1:36:15] later perhaps but if they get a true
[1:36:17] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:36:19] framework of the Christian Church and by
[1:36:21] God's Spirit discern them withstand the
[1:36:22] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[1:36:24] powerless before her now the Antichrist
[1:36:26] spirit wants to take the promise of the
[1:36:28] day away from the people right he wants
[1:36:30] to make them formal cold and powerless
[1:36:33] and indifferent that's the end of guys
[1:36:36] spirit takes a promise away puts it on
[1:36:38] someone else is why maybe we'll say oh
[1:36:40] if only brother Branham was here did
[1:36:42] everything would be fine no he's not
[1:36:44] here the same spirit is here the mighty
[1:36:47] angel is here what God didn't want us to
[1:36:50] admire a prophet he won't rest admire
[1:36:52] him and his
[1:36:54] - manifesting that's what he wanted
[1:36:56] right people say well and any people
[1:36:59] look for a turn ministry no it's here
[1:37:03] and the bride this is the return
[1:37:05] ministry on the problem but in the bride
[1:37:08] right so we don't want to look for the
[1:37:10] whale from the future well for the past
[1:37:12] God's here
[1:37:13] he's manifesting his word here he's
[1:37:16] alive here hallelujah now amen
[1:37:24] so we have to I'll just finish with the
[1:37:30] scripture seasoned Ephesians three says
[1:37:32] and to make and to make all men see what
[1:37:35] is the Fellowship of the mystery that
[1:37:37] word Fellowship is actually the same
[1:37:38] word we ready to fill them on
[1:37:39] communication see what the Fellowship of
[1:37:42] the mystery which from the beginning of
[1:37:44] the world hath been hid in God who
[1:37:46] created all things by Jesus Christ to
[1:37:48] the intent that now unto the
[1:37:50] principalities and powers and heavenly
[1:37:52] places might be made known by the church
[1:37:55] the manifold wisdom of God according to
[1:37:57] the eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:37:59] Christ Jesus our Lord and whom we have
[1:38:01] boldness and access with confidence by
[1:38:05] the faith of him so now we've come to a
[1:38:08] time where all the principalities and
[1:38:10] powers and him any places may be known
[1:38:12] by the church why we're living in that
[1:38:14] time we're not looking for it to come
[1:38:15] we're here you know it's like you know
[1:38:17] you know what brother bærum who used the
[1:38:19] illustration of I think it was Benjamin
[1:38:21] Franklin
[1:38:22] he knew electricity yo he saw lightning
[1:38:24] he thought there must be some way to
[1:38:26] harness it and he got a kite and he put
[1:38:28] a key on the end just blow the car and
[1:38:30] he put it up into a storm and then and
[1:38:32] then the lightning hit the key and came
[1:38:34] down to whatever did he says I've got it
[1:38:36] I've got it he had no idea what he had
[1:38:37] and he had no idea how to put it in
[1:38:39] action
[1:38:40] it was just a big flash of light and it
[1:38:42] looked exciting it was more than what
[1:38:44] they had before that and he's trying to
[1:38:46] tap into something my thought came but
[1:38:48] he came a price at a time where someone
[1:38:50] who had the knowledge could not only
[1:38:52] your look at electricity but could
[1:38:54] harness it and it was innocent whoever
[1:38:56] made the light bulb
[1:38:57] he said now I've got it right now I've
[1:38:59] got what Franklin had but now it's bill
[1:39:01] to be harnessed and you
[1:39:02] right and now we've seen of this being
[1:39:05] powers they've been available yo to the
[1:39:07] church Peter costed I've got it I've got
[1:39:08] it
[1:39:09] and they had it I didn't really know
[1:39:10] what they had I believe it took an
[1:39:12] entire profit to come up in the word
[1:39:13] they would really see what we have and
[1:39:16] how it works and what it does hallelujah
[1:39:19] I mean so that's why I believe we should
[1:39:21] dig into the storehouse of God's Word
[1:39:23] what what is this electricity do it
[1:39:27] doesn't run out another flaw fuse I mean
[1:39:30] that doesn't run our battery power and
[1:39:31] can do all things yes I believe we
[1:39:34] should dig into the scripture search out
[1:39:36] the deep things of God what would you
[1:39:38] have me know reveal your glory because
[1:39:41] the view reveals us word to you all you
[1:39:42] can do is pray sir
[1:39:43] Oh even does worship her hallelujah
[1:39:46] because we know all true worship is
[1:39:48] based on Revelation hello
