group from New Zealand from around the world went to a little basketball court in Auckland and made the Lord face to face a small basketball court nothing much to it a small stage a few mics speakers

Pro it's the sheriff I'm sister Naomi [Music] Damon [Music] the title of this song is I see a cloud like a man's hands I'm before start the song I'd like to take you on a little journey this morning to first Kings chapter 17 in chapter 18 when the Lord to the ledger to tell a hab that he will withdraw rain indeed from the land of Samaria there was to be no rain there was to be no food in the land of Sumeria but he told Elijah to go to the brook of ferry and in the brook of sheriff cherith the law to allow you to stay in weights and the Lord fed him with crows and bread Amon and it came to pass when the brook was dried up the law to Elijah to go forth and on his way to admit a widow and Elijah followed the words of the Lord and he went on his way and thus he met a widow and he asked the waiter for some cake and a drink and the widow said all I have right now is for me and my son to eat before we die and Elijah said unto the woman prepare me the cake anyway prepare merely drink for you shall be blessed there shall be an abundance of wine pouring from your pot and you shall help on the bonus of bread and by faith should put the bread and cake and drink to Elisha anyway and Elijah told her that you shall be satisfied until rain comes forward until rain comes upon the land and it came to pass when the son of the widow was sick the Bible said that the spirit had will have had left the child's body the breath has left the child's body and Elijah took the child onto the mountain and laid the child bear on the floor and said O Lord the child is sick father pouring rain and heal this child the Bible said Elijah put his body on to the child three times on the third time the child was raised and I'd like to take the child to the brother and therefore the widow saw the glory of the Lord two times amen thank you Jesus and it came to pass when the Lord then told Elijah to go and tell a head that he has an abundance of rain that there will be rain on the land [Music] and Elijah went up to Mount Carmel with his servants and told his servant to go beyond TDC and look forth and the servant went out to the sea and he came back with reports and totalizer there is no rain there was nothing Elijah said go back look again the Bible said on the seventh time the servants came back with reports and the servant the servant said Elijah I see a cloud like a man's hand I lied you got up until they have jump on your chariot come down to your people and spread the news for the Lord will rain down and there I say this on the 13th to the 17th of December in Auckland there

god bless you so I'll have you here as well god bless you all the way from Korea Joseph you're welcome I mean just ah so I was a 66 verses 1 & 2 it says let's say at the Lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those for all those things hath mine handmaid and all those things have been said the Lord but to him this man will I look even to him that is pouring of a contrite spirit and trembler at my word a malicious bow heads and a word of Prayer gracious father we are so thankful we can say our Father which art in heaven Lord it means the world to us to know where where we are from and where we're going Lord that this earth is not a home we are just passing through this place and father

father go beyond the language barrier even this morning Lord may just have your way among us quicken us by your spirit laws and father we just want to commit the service into your hands be with those who are away and father may you receive all honor glory and praise Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you all you may have your seats this morning amen so I'd also like to read from Luke chapter 2 and we're going to read verses 8 down to verse 18 amen as as Omar not here today she here today weren't those backdrops amazing hey man a man's incredible I mean god bless your the play went very well I'm looking forward to watching it it was hard to be in the back you wanted to be in the front I got this you're Luke 2 in verse verses 8 down to 18 and they're in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and it shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was worth there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on peace I mean sigh and on earth peace and goodwill towards men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherd's said one to another let us go now even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the LORD hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they had they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds I mean you know we know this is a Christmas season but we know that we do not worship a God of history well you know we're thankful to have this time of year to worship God even though we know he wasn't born in this time of year cuz it's winter up in the northern hemisphere he was born in the springtime but you know it's amazing when you know we read there in Psalms a hundred that you know know you that the Lord he is God and he has made us and we are and not we ourselves we are his people so he has made us for a purpose he has fashioned us by his word that we would manifest as upon the earth and we are as as we read in Isaiah 66 God is asking heavens my throne earth is my footstool so I made all things I made the galaxies the stars the moon's the all these things but where's the place of my rest that's where he's asking and I trust when we read that you show something in you she said he's talking about me Here I am Lord I'm the place of your rest your question has been answered wholly by my life amen I answer that question we say where's the place of my rest I am the place of your rest my soul amen because God doesn't dwell in a temple made with hands but he dwells in the human soul amen so we are the place of his race hallelujah God has been looking for a place to race and here we are I mean so now we you know it's amazing when you read the you know read the Gospels you know we see that they have repeated themselves in this day I mean where where people like the Shepherd's where people have received an angelic visitation and that visitation has pointed them directly to where Christ the word is right so because we know in the scripture that angel means a messenger and an angel is not always a heavenly being butter but a manner a a minister as an angel as well right as as Paul would say in Galatians 4 and 14 he says in my temptation which was in my flesh he despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus so they receive Paul as an angel of God and he was note we know he was a man right so hey so a so an angel and the scripture is not always a heavenly being but it as a man as a messenger right so but a true angel or a true messenger will have a scriptural message from God and they will point the people to where God is in their day and God will supernaturally confirm that word right so you see the angels message they the angel told them go to Bethlehem you'll find the Messiah in a manger they heard the angels message and they followed the angels message and they found the Christ exact where the angel said he would be they would they weren't you know they didn't go to the manger say he's not here and then they went somewhere else and found him they found him exactly where the angel said right so a true angel from God will point the people to where Christ is right because we know he's not a babe in a manger now I mean he's not walking the shores of Galilee in his corporal body ami but he is his living word right the Apostle Paul said we don't know him after the flesh anymore though we have known him after that manner because we know him as his Living Word right Christ is his word you cannot separate the word from Jesus they are one hallelujah and that's why it's so important that we recognize he is his word I mean because he's not a God of our imagination he is his word so we can have confidence God you are your word you cannot separate yourself so if I stand on your word you will back up your word because that is you you cannot lie you cannot deviate your word is true hallelujah we can stand upon that word amen so now that's why it's amazing the angels they didn't go to the priests they didn't go to the temple they went to shepherds in the field amen to show the kind of people that will receive the message amen in their day imagine that you're your brother Brahim dramatized imagine the high priest going into a stinking stable they wouldn't go near the place oh this place is going to be swept out first send some servants and clean it up I'm not going in with her you know where the animals you know they poo and they we and they do all kinds of things caphis is going with his nose you know with a pig on his nose can I come in because people weren't humble to themselves to where Christ is and man doesn't change hallelujah so now so it's the kind of people that that God's in the message who were poor humble shepherds amen and now notice now the Shepherd's after they they saw the Christ they didn't just well say that was need and go back to their old lives they've been going to publish it abroad we've seen the Messiah I mean so they so the Angels message awaken them to what God was doing in the day it gave them a revival but it awakened them they weren't your ship is on the field anymore listen we have seen the Word made flesh in our day and it revived awaken them probably and then they begin to preach we have found him and they could say because they can say where is he I'll show you I'll show you here is cuddly and the people that heard his message but see the Christ in their day hallelujah that's a true believer I mean the true angel will point the field with crisis and the people that hear the word will see him and not just see him but become one with him hallelujah I mean that's why we don't you see a prophet in the pillar of fire I mean we make that pillar of fire we need Jesus Christ the word Halloween so we will just talk about him we made him amen that's what this works hallelujah I mean the wise men they saw a star in their day I trust when you read the scripture it's not just nice stories not just my songs but you can put yourself God says you're the wise man you're the shepherds hallelujah it goes from a story to a reality I trust the scripture it becomes a reality to you amen hallelujah so now the wise men they see the star in the east there in the east they come West I mean they follow the star all the way from where they were they knew it was scripture made being fulfilled because it says in Genesis that a star would rise out of Jacob hallelujah I mean we know Daniel was there from Babylon he taught all the wisdom to the he taught the wise men I mean and that was passed down so they saw the star and they journeyed they went east west but when they came to Jerusalem we won't read it but when they come to Jerusalem because being a natural people they thought we'll go to the headquarters we'll go to the headquarters of the church but when they went in there the they didn't see the star when they went into Jewish and that gone to Jerusalem may say where is he born King of the Jews and the people who should have known exactly what was going on with a most surprised people who weren't even Israel knew what was going on the people who knew girls know what do you mean what's going on the Kings bore what's going on we have a king he's here dears all of us they're all surprised and they even went to the scripture and said yes no I'm basically him he'll be born why didn't they just don't know you know journey to Bethlehem why didn't they just go no they just read it yeah that's happening that's happening okay and they stay where they are do you think they should have been a traffic jam going out of Jerusalem I mean we just taught movies there's too many people shouldn't be the mass exodus oh you mean messiahs born well where is he hallelujah so now they're all and the problem was is because you know if you take the night sky you know we go out here and it's all yeah you know sometimes it's all the stars out because it's all the man-made lights you can't see the heavens I mean buddy you just travel a bit or if you have a mess power cut you'll see the heavens as they really are but it's the man-made lights that man has put up blinds us from the reality of the heavens right so all the man-made lights all the religious lights in Jerusalem or the denominational lifes and Jerusalem blinded out what the heavens were saying and that's why they didn't see the stuff but since when they leave Jerusalem then they saw the star again why because the man-made lights of their religion weren't blinding in to where the Star Wars hallelujah and then so now the wise men they followed the star and they found the Christ right and we know from the scripture that there's been seven stars sent to the seven churches who are seven angels messages to the churches right so everyone that follows the star in their day will see Jesus Christ in the word right they will be led right they won't be lead to a man or to a system but they will meet Jesus Christ of living world in there Holloway that's what the father's the stop points you to wait probably I mean that's what the brother brand's message does he points you to Jesus Christ award hallelujah that's what it does so we've seen is star on the eighth and we've come to worship Him ever seen Christ in our day holiday I'm glad aren't you I'm very glad I mean so they so they came they gave their gifts and we know that you know we give our lives or here's my side of the word or we give ourselves to Holy Week we don't have maybe don't have gold or frankincense or myrrh but we're good our lives come live with us our God how do you manifest yourself through us I mean so those who follow the true star will not only see the Lord in their day but they'll be truly united with him so that's what really Christmas is all about deity and humanity uniting upon the earth right that's what Christmas is really about I mean I'm so glad that's why I love Christmas I mean so now as Christ was born in a manger so he must be born in your heart right you've got to recognize you're nothing but a stinking manger I mean people polish this thing up they you know they refine what they eat they have its fitness and all these things but in reality we're just just thinking major amen but I'm so glad I'm so I'd rather be a manger with the Messiah in me than the finest palace that's what I would rather be I mean so he must be birthed in your heart right but then now when that happens you see his word manifesting through you and that's what Christmas is all about amen so now it says it says in John it says and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and he dropped down to verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth so the word became flesh right among us now we just can't put that back in history but the word has to be put in flesh today right through the word put our heads put on flesh right hallelujah so now we are living in a day where God as soon as people once again that's why we shot that's why we're happy that's why the word puts on flesh in us and it's word has manifested through us is because he has put on flesh again you say well I don't know about that well says in first John four and two it says hereby know we the Spirit of God every spirit that confesseth confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in flesh is of God notice the word is right and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus has come and flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of Antichrist where are we have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world right so says that every spirit that confesseth that he is coming flesh not has come right everyone can point back yes he was born in a manger yes he died on Calvary yes he was back there but it is come right he is coming flesh so now as he was in the beginning so instead of being one man he's in a multi-member body his bride right he is coming to human flesh that's why brother of says this the bride coming of Jesus Christ right I start scary at Scripture right this is the bride coming right where God comes and steps under his bride to manifest this word out of her hallelujah I trust you can say that's me Amen hallelujah Amen the Holy Ghost States Simon and Ana right to the Christ and the temple amazing here comes the God who who gave Moses the instructions to build the temple he puts on flesh and all the priesthood must at the high priest misses it they all miss it but to see it hallelujah and it's the same thing I mean today the Holy Ghost will lead his children to meet him in this day I miss why it's so vital you look at what's leading me in this season I met trust us the one treating you hallelujah I mean I trust us that today aren't you glad I mean we could be as blind spiritually blind as Anna well she was physically blind right but we were spiritually blind but then he opened our eyes he lead us straight to where he is it won't laughter you maybe thought you're crazy but you saw I see Messiah I don't care I've met him it's amazing hallelujah I mean I'm so glad I'm so glad we can be like Simon in the temple he said God told him he wouldn't die till he sees the Christ wouldn't you be happy about that I'm not gonna die I see Messiah hundreds of years promising waiting waiting or finally I'm going to see it hallelujah I'm gonna see him in my day I did yeah a lot of people would pray say that old man's lost his mind he he needs to go on some old age he needs some dementia help or something he knew who he was he knew the promise he had received and he is held on to that promise and he rejoice in that promise hallelujah you know we have the promise of the body changing this day you know we have the promise where we will not there's a generation upon the earth now we're not looking for the future now there is a generation upon the earth that will not seed in your lucky days you'll not get old but you'll turn maybe if you're young you'll become 18 21 if you're older you'll become younger and in your walk with God you'll be not that's the promise of the day doesn't that also make you happy how they'll make you a joyeux amen we're living in that day and I try and and the rapture is a revelation it's a revelation just like the Simon it was a revelation he shall not are we okay so it was a revelation to him I can't die until I see Messiah I can't it was inking an assault and the rapture is a revelation why it's a revelation you're going you're going in the body changed you may die but you'll go anyway it doesn't matter as long as you're in Christ you're going for hallelujah amen I mean we ought to be the happiest people in all the world whoever saved the best gift eternal life what more can you hit one hallelujah glory to God amen now it says now this is I mean young people tear the place up hallelujah don't just sit on back to once you were we've turned a corner [Applause] we have turned a corner I mean there's been a suite gone for can't settle it lady to thank we're in a rapture hallelujah and that's why you feel the poo you do for the sweepers gone well a word has gone forth and it's waved you to take you in a body change hallelujah so don't keep through brother Brad season how can I ever come PC is now I chose this because I think it's a time we should never let the spirit of revival die never ever let the spirit of revival diet we've got to keep in revival presently revive every day Paul said I had to die daily that Christ should lose a man and we must never let that revival die within us but don't let the revival die gotta keep it burning keep the fire burn and what do we do I mean so don't let the camp die that's right it's not just that's like a it's like two people get married they have a honeymoon keep the honeymoon going I mean you may see it'll down have children whatever more keep that keep that feelings first low keep it going hallelujah that's how it should be hey the devil doesn't want us to keep it a revival this like a good marriage you got to work at it right you got to put an effort because you know what you you know what you haven't you know what you wanting know you can have more hallelujah so we must never let the revival lower than us I mean feed your experiences right you do that by reading the Bible listening to the message and pray to him prayer he said I don't know how to pray talk to him from your heart it's so easy you don't need the big flowery words just to be real be real was thought that's all you need to be you take the natural side when you're young you get hungry he said mom I'm hungry my mom hungry is there any food I'm hungry amen but there comes a time when you begin to raid the pantry yourself you begin to find out mama's trying to get you out the pantry but it's not the same with the word right this message is spiritual food for the season right it is stored up for us and mama won't mind if you go raiding that mention the word [Applause] right the pantry hallelujah whatever you do raid the pantry I mean it's like but then also don't just keep it to yourself because it comes a time right we learn to cook right you may doing real simple things but then you come to a time when you can begin to cook your for your family and put on a roast steak pizza curry whatever is the same thing with the spiritual you get into the pantry you begin to cook get the

christabel's let's press the battle no season an invisible union of the bride on Christ he says but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the Word of God watch then again you see now that the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out the cash a bride catch that woman a live right and that's where you

you away hallelujah amen and that's why the bride is having a revival the bride is having a revival we don't need to wait for it it's raining furnace hey to quicken use of the word already hallelujah it's raining the bride is having her revival well what is the revival it's an awakening but you just like the Shepherd's they were awakened by the urgent message it's the Christ I need something cuz I'm running out of steam hallelujah glory to God but they had an awakening they realized the day in their message but the message was messiahs upon the youth Brian Hillary that man and God had become one right and is the same thing today a messages come right the seventh angel has spoken a word of the earth and it's awakened us right that's good brother I'm I'm thinking that's awakened us amen to the reality of this day and your message and your messages it's not a bunch of doctrine it's not do's and don'ts it's an awakening that a people come to their position in Christ that they would realize they are the elect lady she is him she's the Lambs wife hallelujah that's what the message is come out that's the tattoo awaken you realize I'm not just here this is not my culture this is not my this is not my way I mean but I am from God I mean my father is gone during birth upon the earth and I have become his word by His grace but I made in his image hallelujah yes that's where we are today that's why that's why the Spirit of God grips your soul because he's awakening over God we've got reinforcements hello that's why but but that's why the message awakens you it's because it's it's sent for a elect bride of Jesus Christ right you didn't elect yourself if God elected me I'm in you can't unelect me if I'm called by god I'm cold if he justified me unjustified evolving glorified horrified get to work let's his choosing you take it up with him it's not my problem totally it's his doing right it's God's doing so God God put me in you can't put me out and I can't put myself out because God put me in hallelujah I just rather come easy and let God look whyever deathbed confession when you can serve God every day of your life I'd rather live that kind of way hallelujah Amen now now he sees a num soon as we would see Jesus he says now I don't know what's next I'm just here all I know here's a person I'm preaching the word saying he's not dead he's alive he's alive and promised to identify himself in our flesh human flesh like he did back there he says all that God was he poured into Christ or Christ was he poured into the church watch him Christ in us now he's not just saying nice words to say well that sounds neat but he's he's saying all that God was God is the healer God is a redeemer God as a savior God as a comfort God as a guide God is an advocate God is an intercessor and we could expand on those things but all he was he poured into you he bought into Christ the spoken word that was in God a man is in Christ right and that same parish and the bride you know that Christ was is poured into you you understand we see the third pull the spoken word manifestation right we are living in the hour where that is here right the squeeze brother Graham said what has been demonstrated temporarily will come into its fullest when the squeeze comes on right but we're already being squeezed right but the power all the squeeze does is basically activate what's in you right we're not looking that's why I say it's raining we're not looking for another movie with spirit the spirits moving we're not looking for another message the message has come the shot has come well let's get the messages the shout right of first Thessalonians 4 twin are looking for nights miss there's no such silly Lake villager and now the bride the bride's ministry time only so now we're living in a day where Christ as in his people manifesting his word to this endtime hallelujah so now everything Christ was he poured into the church all that Christ was he said poured into you hallelujah that's why you say well you say well how can within what do you mean there's healing in me what he's in you people have access to healings you say well I don't know about that well if you look in the book of Acts God always works through his body right so here's his Peter goes by the gate beautiful silver and gold have our number such as I have give IV because that Jesus Christ was in him and the man who is lame was lifted up in heels because healing was in him it was paid at Calvary you understand there's an excess you know what you carry hallelujah I'm hallelujah amen gyah Peter Peter is there in Joppa he has the vision of the tent I mean I mean the sheet come down with all the unclean animals you know and and God's dealing with them about speaking to the Gentiles at same time there's two men from Cornelius house come Gentiles and and and they say Cornelius our master has had a visitation of an angel and the angel said go get you to preach to us eternal life the angel could have done it but God doesn't use angels that way God uses man right so now God sent sorry so so God told Cornelius go get Peter Peter comes into the house now eternal life's can be ministered because God work walks works through the body right just like comfort he's our comforter right he's our comforter know what happens when you feel down and a brother or sister come up next you have some fellowship we're having comfort begins to be ministered well they your old troubled someone comes on just just just just share something with your speaks peace comes right hello yeah your old band up some complex of mind metal someone comes to hear the word or something and that's broken here's a deliverer that's in the body so all he was he's poured into you now if that is the case this is so the bride is the mechanics and the Holy Ghost is the dynamics I mean so now he says so just like a car brother MCS in the rising of the Sun it's like you take two Cadillacs they can be just off the assembly line perfectly built everything's fine but one doesn't have a spark plug the other there's a spark locus it's just that little piece that fires that little spark will actually prove well that Cadillac can do I mean both drivers can boast look at this it's got this horsepower v8 whatever ID it you know all those different things amen and be with me just be number of doors in color but and then everything else is to dick Nicole but anyway you know they could say all those things but the one that has a spark plug that is the one that can prove what's in the tank can actually go right it just takes that little spark that spark plug to be turned on in your life the Holy Ghost to be ignited and then now what's in you the word in you will prove itself I mean cause like the gasoline the words are guessing the Holy Spirit ignites the word and makes it live hallelujah so the bride is the mechanics and the Holy Ghost is the dynamics he says now he says the only thing he can do is wash it out see if it's wide enough he can sew it speaking of a doctor but God has to heal it see nature has to develop cells life life has to put that together the body has to produce calcium so forth and has life itself calcium or an heal it's life see there's not there's no medicine that heals medicine only cleans while God heal see there's no medicine hills if I cut my hand and fall dead here and you take me to the doctor say would you heal this man he'd say way he's dead all right then you say well let's sew it up and you've got some medicine that heals at hand haven't you he says no we haven't see if they saw me up and give me embalming fluid and that make me look natural for a hundred years and give me a shot of penicillin every day and put on some self seven that place certainly will not heal why because that life has gone out of it why then which is the healer medicine or life now you tell me what life is and I'll tell you who God is he God is life see we have so much on the mechanics and not the dynamics now my body is the mechanics but my body will operate with the dynamics the spirit see the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the Holy Ghost that gets into this word not a seminary that teaches you all the theology and Greek interpretations but it's the dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to sit there to fire and to bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what the promise word of this hour not mechanics the dynamics it takes the mechanics and dynamics the word and the spirit they are they are the one that gives life amen what God promised for the hour look for it to be fulfilled you must look to him because he is the word and the only way you can look to the word is look to him look to him he is the word and the word promised for this day is to be fulfilled this day Noah's time could not be filled this day was only a type Moses time so forth but this is the day that God has promised these things that we're enjoying these things we're now seeing that the world that the world's laughing at this great monumentous power of the Holy Spirit that can change your sinner's heart they can take a look warm church member and give him a testimony that'll set the church afire from where he came out of it's the dynamic that got into the word hallelujah now we are living in an hour where this this has become flesh every part of it right and we've gone from now as brother Brahim said oh I think it's in I think it's in what's on the attraction of the mountain it's gone from the Prophet to the prophecy right so we're not just standing here declaring Malachi for Malachi for Malachi 4 but no What did he say because the word he preached open the scripture to us yep so now it's gone from the Prophet to the prophecy I'm not caught up with William Branham I'm caught up with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the word Rebecca didn't fall in love with Eleazar she fell in love with Isaac right that was the main thing and that was eleazar's mission it wasn't that Rebecca would fall in love with him at that though that he would tell Rebecca enough about Isaac that they fell in love as soon as I saw each other right and they're saying they're with brother C's I'm not the I'm not the one he's the one but he's the one you should follow and fall in love with right and he is the word hallelujah now now we've come to a time with a bride has taken shape right there's a mature group of people upon the earth even even we may be young and age but there's a quick short work it's happening it's already happening right so now brother Graham says in spoken word is the original seat he says now the law of reproduction bring forth after its kind Genesis 111 says that every seed bring forth after its kind these last days true church bride comes to the headstone will be the super church a super race as they near the great headstone there will be so much like him even they will be in his very image in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God amen and I wanted to declare to you that's here right we're not looking off in the future we have to stop looking way off in the future and realize what God has done in us now right that he has United he is molded and shaped us that we met him Amen that his nature we received that nature right that the nature we're born with us burned out by the Holy Ghost and we receive his nature what's that it's us and the headstone coming together holiest so the more now he's nears the earth to take us in a rapture right his corporal his physical coming we're gonna meet him in the air but we're physically going to meet him in the air his spirits upon the earth now his word is here right but we're going to physically meet him in the air that same body he took the Calvary and resurrected and right they glorified for we're gonna meet we're gonna meet him hallelujah we really are it's gonna happen just like should Christmas happen we're gonna that's gonna happen toddler that's really good Loreena got this gonna be a meeting in the end the sweet sweet by-and-by and it's not very far away hallelujah amen we should be under expectation but what if he doesn't come this year he'll come next year what about the next year worried he'll come the he's coming for me amen though his coming may seem to be delayed he's right on time he knows exactly I mean that's why we got a we need some missionary zeal right because we ain't going to the last ones in right the the gospel ship is not leaving harbor until everyone's in the boat right so and and and what we need is not necessary just miss Raziel for the jungles but the suburbs right this part we're in this father video can we need a missionaries you're the push of us well I'm in the hate they could be right there they could be right there hallelujah let's find that they could be at your school they could be in university wherever maybe they could be right next to you I want to go home why you witnessing it's actually all for me I want to go home that's a bit selfish no I go home I'm done can we go now you know well if our jobs not done we're staying here amen God has done you don't understand we saw our God will do it God uses men his plan has always been tied into men right he'll get it done but he needs willing vessels to get it done right so God God didn't you know he could have had the wind preach the gospel the night you know you know a dog would come up and preach the gospel to you God could do it that way but God uses men so we said we better say Lord were available hallelujah whatever whatever we call to do oh Lord I want to know Amen so they would become the very manifestation of the word of the Living God hallelujah so now we are not the manifestation of a church or a Creed's of man or denomination but know the word of the Living God amen that when people see you they should see this they should see this manifesto I mean so the character of Christ you read about should be in you his nature should be a how he dealt with things you should deal the same way because it's him living mimic Christianity is not you it's him being the Christian he is the Christian in you that's how you become a Christian you don't mind sup well I'm going to turn a new leaf I'm going to start again no you just give yourself and say Lord take this thing imma failing to begin with who realizes they were friendly to begin with it's a great victory when you realize I was born a failure and if I say this way I'll die a failure but if I give myself to you Lord I will not be a failure because you are the one who is victorious in me that's what we need to be we can't do it our own strength what doesn't want us to do an iron strength you know if you think about it and there's that Christian you know you're a lot of Christianity is today they're thinking they're gonna go to the great white I mean you know you're around the throne of the Lamb and the Lord's gonna say you did so well and I said yeah I did do well I did very well I was devout I listened this much and read this much and prayed this much and witness this much and I didn't know this that's gonna be that's gonna because gonna be worship right Lord you caused me to come here well you quicken me and come in what do you reveal yourself to me what do you save me by by your grace it's gonna be a worship what you did it I couldn't do it you did it hallelujah you came down to where I was I when I could not go you came to me hallelujah I mean that I could go to where you were that's how it's gonna be well how did you get here I don't know we were gonna be the table how did you get here I just say you see him he said I was gonna be here that's why I'm here I was invited I said yes Amen so now he is he is the one who's living through us right so now we've come to a time and we are at that time yo this is the news this is current events the bride has become the word right the bride has become the word the bride is a living Bible but it's not in part it's in fullness right Luther had it in part the just shall live by faith just a little bit of word and they manifested that word in that day and as the Reformation continued the word got greater then Wesley came with justification the just shall live by faith in sanctification it was more the word they were just manifesting that then the Pentecostals with the gifts God just adds but now it's not just some part it's in fullness in you right we don't just manifest part of the word the whole word the whole word you understand we're not just part of it we're all of it amen that's what this message has come to do to birth a bride into manifestation amen brother Bram says and scene is not here with the shock and if you want to listen to a message go listen to that one a few times when a shock comes forth out of the grain of wheat or wheat or a blade of wheat now he's talking about how how how a wheat plant grows right so after the pollen has fallen in there the second stage it produces the third stage this shook which is now if you're not real close observer you'll never be able to tell what that is in the real grain of wheat in this of the shook as as over the grain right but as the grain grows the shook opens up and then the grain comes out and then the Sun is directly on the grain okay but the shook looks very much like the grain because it's a it's a protection right when that first little grain comes forth it looks like a grain but you sit down and open it up you'll find there's no grain at all it's only a shook a carrier of the grain now the grain comes forth from that but remember there's no more after that shock remember there's no more seed promised through a woman anywhere after Mary so we had Hagar before this male sarah brought forth isaac more like the promise then Mary brought forth Christ right and he was the promise but Mary just carried the promise right and so now as God has brought forth a restoration been the same way right so we had Luther just shall live by faith a bit of the promise but didn't look like didn't look like the book of Acts right and then Wesley came more like the promise but didn't look like the book of Acts but looked more like it than Luther right and then the Pentecostals came with the restoration of the gifts it looked more like the promise then where's the or Luther but it wasn't the promise right and then that's why the word has to come forth right and there's no more denominations promised after Pentecost we're not a denomination we are not Shakur Turan we're not divided we're not just cabbage doubt on one idea we've got the whole promise right and we're walking forward we're not here to make kingdoms upon the earth where that you know the whole purpose of having a church is people would be birthed into the kingdom built up into the statue of a perfect man that we could take eruptions that each individual would be the living would be the living Tabernacle living God's dwelling place and there's no more denominations after Pentecost it's the rapturing bride coming forth from me of the seed the word made manifest again this is where we are so we've come to that stage we were no longer just carriers of the life but we are that life the bride becomes the word hallelujah now what is the greatest you say well if we the word now what's the greatest miracle that Jesus did was it raising the dead coming the storm cursing the fig tree feeding the thousands no those are all incredible things raising Lazarus incredible but to me the greatest the greatest miracle he did is when he went to get cemani he subjected his flesh to the word he had to fulfill but he said not my will but thy will be done and he went to Calvary as a man he knew what he had to do right he knew for this cause I've come to the world he knew he was the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world he knew what he had to fulfill rights but he subjected his own flesh to the word that was for him that is such a great miracle I mean where where where a man he was a man like us right he wasn't born in sin but he's still a man like us right and so but so the greatest miracle to me is that he subjected his flesh to the word allotted to him right and now if the bride has become the word she will do the same thing now we're going to take a a quarter-turn I've really set you up for I'm going to talk about now okay now let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 hallelujah a man who loves the Lord this morning so in Galatians 5 I'll read from verse 29 oh sorry Ephesians Ephesians 5 29 the Apostle Paul so he speaking of the husband and wife we're just going to take the last part of it I mean say I mean if you there I mean for no man so this is verse 29 of Ephesians 5 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless there every one of you in particular so love his wife even as as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband now he's speaking he says this is a great mystery that's been revealed in this day when he says that men and woman become one flesh they're actually one being right and he's saying now just as Christ and the churches saw as husband and wife so now if that's the case then husbands us husbands are actually like God to our family in that way we're the head of the family right right and and the wives are the same as the bride - to Christ now we know the Lord he proves himself so our Lord Jesus he's a man of stability right he's not an unstable God he doesn't go off on temper temper tantrums doesn't just run off you know throw hissy fit and throw us all in the trash can he is a man of stability right because he has an in goal in mind and that in goal is of people made in His image and he's very determined he's wide minded hallelujah he's made up his mind and that's it he doesn't change his thoughts he cannot God God can have not another thought he's already expressed it in his word right so he never so he's a man of stability right and so so if you take our Lord Jesus now he has so God doesn't just say he loves us he proves it right he proved it on Calvary there was the greatest manifestation of his love as when he hung between heavens and earth for you for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever would believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life right so it's not just a word but it became manifest right so he proved that he loved us right and he proved he loved us in this day by sending Malachi 4 before the grain dreadful day of the Lord hallelujah so now he doesn't just say he loves us but he proves it right the Lord Jesus himself proves that he is faithful and true right I trust when I say these things you say yes he has so maybe your mind will go back he was faithful here who is faithful here he kept me here Amen right so he proves himself to be faithful and true it's not just idle words it's a reality he proves himself over and over and over and over again right that he is faithful and true hallelujah to you right Amen that when you're in a spot so and and he does this that when you come to a spot in your walk and there'll be many where you do not understand what's going on right and you don't seem to know the answer you know that he still abides faithful even when he doesn't answer you even when you do not understand what's going on you know he is in control you know that he is there with you because he has already proved himself faithful and he does not change so if he is faithful to you a year ago he's still faithful today right if he's still true a year ago he's still true today because he is faithful and true hallelujah right so doesn't matter what happens we know because he's proved himself I'm trying to bring up in here no thanks not just idle words he proves himself faithful and truth that we know when he seems like he's distant he's present and he is working and we can rest knowing that he has our best interest in mind even though we do not understand what's going on hallelujah he says and Susan doesn't convinced and concerned well the baby says don't you believe that the same Jesus that was raised up from the grave has come back in the form of the Holy Ghost and is in us now a little while the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you see to the end of the consummation to the end of the world I'll be right with you I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee lo I am with you always even to the end of the world see the world doesn't see it but you shall see it the world doesn't believe it I mean the ones that believes it as the ones that receives it he says that as true it says in Hebrews 13:5 and Six's let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me why because we know he is he'll never leave me not nor forsake me hallelujah so he never just runs off in a huff and abandons us for no reason he's not that kind of husband he doesn't just go off in a huff I'm sick of what you're doing and he just goes off right he stays faithful even if we do not abide faithful he stays faithful and revelations 19 we're just going to read a bit if you don't mind revelations 19 11 and this is when I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true holy that's our Lord riding forth and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head was many crowns for his name it was written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen clean and white holy so he's Here I am faithful and true I'm coming forth to conquer hallelujah amen now God is God is love we we know but that love is divine love is not human love human love is conditional right if basically if you're good to me I'll be good to you that's human love it's based on how you treat me as if I'll love you in return that's human love right but God does not pray that way God's love is not based on condition right it's not based on you it's he doesn't when he loves he's not looking for what he'll get back he just loves right it's not a it's not he's not looking for it to be reciprocated he says I love you anyway because that's how I love right but humans love based on how they're how its reacted to right so divine love is unconditional it's not based on how you're treated and returned it doesn't matter if it's thrown back completely in your face right now I'm saying these things is because if we're made in His image this is this is where the rubbers on the road if we're made in His image if the brightest kind of full manifestation you know then as he was we will be right so now if he is divine love then that divine love is enough hallelujah amen his nature's in us everything he has we become by his grace right so now if that is the case then how we treat each other will be based on divine love right so in other words it doesn't matter how you treat me I'm gonna love you anyway right and it's not going to be a fake love where I'll hold a grudge right because that's still human love he said I'll treat them anyway but I but I resent them in my heart that's not divine love because Jesus is on Calvary said Father forgive them they don't know what they do he didn't hold a grudge holy to be like Jesus grudge free hallelujah Amen to know so now if that is the case so now as so as as husbands and what you're as families we should love each other not based on what they do right but based on what the Lord has done for us that's how we should treat each other because if he loved me and redeem me and save me right you know when you first meet him you just love everybody you know that time that's how we should be irrespective of how people treat us you say well it's hard I'm in this thing yeah but he gave us overcoming power I mean so it can be done because Jesus did it hallelujah that's how we should build their confidence Jesus rose from the grave the Saints are gonna race father did came back to life it's been done Jesus did it it can be done hallelujah so now it says in 1st Peter chapter 2 let's just go here a little bit it's got a first Peter 2 amen say say Amen when you're there not when you're neighbors there when you're the first Peter - we're gonna read from the last last part of the chapter so first Peter 2 in 23 gonna read down so when he was when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who has own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we were healed for ye were as sheep gone astray but now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls so look so so so so notice how he operated when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to him that judgeth Slee right so that so so this is how he was now let's go to the next let's go to the next chapter likewise he wives so now he's going to what Peter's just written he's gonna he's gonna bring it down home he says likewise so that means in like manner as you've just read so shall you be right ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may be without the would be won by the conversation of the wives now that were conversation means manner of life behavior it's right so as Jesus was here he was revolved revolved not again right when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously likewise he following me likewise this is how wife should be amen this is how wife should be I mean that that doesn't matter how they treated I mean doesn't matter how they treated by their spouse they can love with the love of God and be exactly like Jesus was you following me I'm gonna come back to husbands suta don't worry Haven but they see this is how it should be but he because he the reason he did this is he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously so if your life is committed to the Lord it doesn't matter how you're treated right because you've committed yourself to him and nothing happens without him allowing it anyway right Joe Satan had to get permission to go from God to touch job so Satan has to go before God to us permission to affect you he's not running around freewheeling doing what he wants though he's gonna he sends a lot of emails can I do this job requests can I do this do this you know it's up to the boss God responds back yes no yes no here's the parameters and he can't go beyond the parameters right he couldn't you know he said to Satan you can touch everything but not joke Jobe wasn't touched he lost everything apart from his wife he oh he lost his kids and all the stuff and then many then Satan comes back oh it's only because he's fine you can do whatever you want just don't take his life came down to the very you know Satan comes Satan comes to the border you know and he if he couldn't go like this but he can't do it God won't let him right so we're gonna have confidence now everything that happens in life God has allowed and God never allow there's nothing vain God doesn't do a vain thing or allow a vain thing there's a reason for every trial we go through there's a reason for all the hardship there's even a reason that we receive pain and wounding how lujah it's not a vain thing right God will use it if you allow him to use it amen maybe this way we'll have different kind of testimonies someone comes and they say I can't relate to these people made me a brother and he pulls up said you know what I was or any one of us you know I can't relate you know these people never like me well what's your history oh this person this person this person you want to hear their story it's like they know my life well it's actually because they've walked in your shoes already that's why we'll have different contests funny hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad Lori to God I mean so it's ease now while so the life so a husband can be won by the life that the wife lives that's powerful I mean while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be as an outward adoring of planning of here a wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price now after this matter in all time the holy woman also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection as their own husband's even as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement now here's some homework go look at the words there from the verse 4 speaks about a meek and quiet spirit doesn't mean a little mouse it doesn't say anything let's see someone who's not tossed always more steadfast right not not not troubled right but but go look at it you say well that's a monumental task know it we have the power right we have the power the Holy Ghost is here to make this live if it's not just all y'all it's not just a body change it's it's every part of life as long as the missus touches every part of life hallelujah there we can you know that the word is manifested not just in church not just in special singing praying whatever to us it's life you go down the street the word is manifested getting with your children the word is manifest you're at work the word is manifested hallelujah amen now if the Lord has taken up residence then that means we no longer have our own nature but we have the nature of God right we have the nature of God in us so that means now if we have the nature of God then what he says we should be in his word we will become it right because his life is in here to manifest that out of us right amen so now this is how we should be but now if we go to you say well I am you say I'm sick of war and gets my flesh I'll say that's a good thing because if you're in a battle that means there's two powers fighting but if you know the battle that means one powers one right so those people are just pandering to their flesh they don't have a battle against it because they just because their flesh is in control right but if they're but but if a person's really the heart's desire is I see you live Lord but this guy gets in a way but it's always gonna be a battle because it's his nature and your nature right and one is in control your one is in control so it's either your nature or his nature it defends us why Paul said we die daily you're going to give your nature over daily you got to keep that's what this thing's still alive it's gonna it's got to be changed you're following me I mean but see he said well I'm sick of racing against this flesh it's a struggle that's good that means I mean then that means you want to see the word become flesh in you hallelujah that's good to have that struggle amen will we ever get victory absolutely we get victory every day sometimes give me just few inches inches inches I mean in the final victory will be had this body's changed the life in you will change this body hallelujah amen now we look at the Old Testament now this is a bit of a segue quickly but Satan made all the believers fall through the Old Testament Moses buyers temper David buyers love a married woman you know many examples you can see God Satan made the prophets and the believers fail but now we've come to it and then even into the even into the New Testament Satan made the church falter to the Creed's of man at Nicaea but now there is a endtime bride that will not fall to their lives of Satan right so we will not fall to to his lies and we will not put up with just living halfway so now so so what I'm trying to say is with that is that we will you know that's why I read the word and and your hostas are trusses Lord I want to become what I read right I want to become us amen and he put that desire in you because he wants to see it manifest I believe amen now it season first Timothy five and eight and maybe we'll pick up this later but I just want to touch it very briefly what we've just read and what we're about to read first Timothy 5:8 says but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel now many times we read their demand and we just take it as natural provision but to me it is not just natural provision I mean but it's spiritual provision right at a spiritual providing for your house right because if your house you know because if the house is meant to be a house serving the Lord and the head is not in its position then that is actually fighting against the rest of the family trying to come to their position in Christ right it's actually worse than an infidel it says here in the word right so now so if any does not provide for his own especially with those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel now to provide the would provide here means to consider in advance there is to look out for beforehand Amen it's it's by the way of maintenance amen as to provide and and in the root word one of the root words that would provide is to exercise the mind to observe that is to comprehend to consider perceived thinker understand so in order to provide for your spiritual needs of your house you better consider the ways they're going right you've got to actually consider you got to perceive what their needs are and you've got to meet that need and you look for the book you look for what's going to happen in the future you're following me right it's actually providing it's not just well we come to church we come Wednesday night you know and that's and and maybe we say a prayer for the meal that's not providing right you have a family altar right the member in the world everyone talks about you know there's like Santa Claus why don't we have Santa Claus here well the world's got Santa Claus they don't need another one here right there's plenty of Christmas trees out there we don't need one if you want Christmas tree you know we don't have one here because it yo you know what I mean like why do we need to talk about reindeer here well it's all that there we're here to talk about the Lord right and it should be the same thing at home our central focus should be him right a family that prays together face together a family talks about the word will stay together by a family that's transparent and it's got to start with the head of the home they say I'm struggling with theirs oh sorry I did this I didn't mean to be this way I'm tired of worn out I have going through this and your children what we can do appreciate that because I see daddy's human too you follow me Gettys you mommy's human too they go through battles as well and then if you really have good fellowship with them they will begin to see what the devil's that that mummy and daddy Ford overcome I'm fighting the same thing right and because what does the devil do the devil tries to tell you that you have you are the only one who's fought this thing no one understands you no one understands what you're going through they don't mom and dad wouldn't understand you they're like old you know they're all you know but the devil because the devil likes to isolate you know we can be families we can be a family in a house so we're gonna be a bunch of individuals in a house depends how you want to be and nobody just takes one person to break through one person to reach out and change the whole family dynamic hallelujah so that's you know he always tries to tell us that no one understands and if you really just sit down and talk to some all the ones you know they could just change the name of the devil you're fighting to the one they fought and you actually boil it down and see they are the same but if they overcame it that means I can overcome and that's why you begin to get godly counsel now well how did you overcome this I just can't seem to and that's a I couldn't overcome it either but the Lord I broke through the Lord and His grace helped me of this you just got to keep being perseverant with the Lord amen oh they say well so I see it's this or don't do this or don't do and and and you can sighs skip the whole trial you know many times we fight you know fight the same devil because we just go around and we and we instead of bypassing the trial we pick up the sword and chop his head off again and you find yourself why am i back here again just ignore him walk on you have to recognize the devil's defeated at Calvary he's a defeated being he was defeated at Calvary I mean that means you don't need to go fight the battle the Lord's already fought the battle a lot of time we just need to ignore the devil and walk just look sometimes you gotta take his hit off your arm to do it sometimes just ignoring my BAM speaks about that I mean so we need to as the head of our homes as the Lord has not the Lord provided our spiritual needs has he not thinking of us for the future right considered in advance what we have need of he has provided while we have need or for the future that's why he stored up a spiritual storehouse in this message how lure that because these can send our spiritual welfare he knew the world is going to get us dark as it's ever been darker it's ever been I mean it's going to be total gross darkness will cover the people but I'm going to put us in a word into the earth and maybe there'll be a light I will be the light in the darkest of Ages I mean that my people will grow up into my image that we built up until my image they'll become the word made flesh I mean they won't need to worry about the darkness because life is come hallelujah light has come upon the earth maybe then and they can rest a mat and then he begins to show now this is what the word is he proves himself over and over again you're the devil loves to try and tell us God doesn't love you God doesn't care that's a lie that's a lie from the pit of hell he does love you he does care he is interested in your life I mean you may have had a distant father but God is not a distant father God is not an indifferent man he's a caring loving man hallelujah I mean that's how he is we don't need to worry don't don't let God become how like how your dad was to you because unfortunately as children that's imprinted upon them that's imprinted upon us that how our father treats us is how we think God treats us and many times I'll say at least 99.99% of the time it's not the same but we need to but that's why you got a and that's a problem every relationship there will be hurt we're human we're human even the most loving relationship there will be hurt and it puts up a bit of a wall right so if that's even in the greatest relationship what about a terrible one the promise God wants to break through the hurt he wants to break through the wall and that's why you've got to actually tell yourself you saying Lord you're not like my dad amen you're not right there's some of the best dads in the world here so I'm not having got any when you understand but how we're raised I don't know where you're from but sometimes you know we've got to realize you know like my earthly father right I don't need the same wall up against you like I maybe have him amen and then he can work and you're glad we have a loving father I'm so thankful we have a wonderful Christmas Allu yeah oh I'll pick that up another time well we're gonna provide spiritually for our families right we're gonna be right there doesn't matter what age they are well they're to become a two-year-old hallelujah well how do you get them in the rose this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine oh don't let Satan blow it up I'm gonna let it shine don't let Satan blow it up I'm gonna let it shine don't let Satan blow it up I'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine well what's happening you creating an atmosphere you're creating atmosphere in your home right yeah I have to tell them the seals just lift the seals right just live the word I mean use simple things like that clear the musicians can they come say well I don't know how to reach them you're a teenager who was I was a teenager once no all of us were a teenager once we understand what it's like I mean we know what it's like to be ten I remember was like three teen I mean whatever right you know you gotta you gotta think their thoughts think their age thoughts right but then the other way you got to realize your mum and dad actually have the best interest in mind they are human yeah but they had that your best interest in mind so they're trying their best I mean I mean they stand shall we this thing jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so merry Christmas everyone hallelujah oh Jesus [Music] oh Jesus love [Music] teachers
