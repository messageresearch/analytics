[3:36] of

[6:05] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[6:11] before. I can see the families gathered.
[6:15] Sweet faces all
[6:18] familiar. No one's old or feeble
[6:24] anymore. Now my lonesome heart is
[6:27] crying. I'm going to spread my wings for
[6:31] flying. I've never been this home sick
[6:36] before. I see the bright light shine.
[6:41] It's just about home
[6:43] time. I can see my father standing at
[6:48] the
[6:49] door. This world has been a
[6:53] wilderness. I'm ready for deliverance.
[6:57] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[7:03] before. I have heard the end time
[7:07] message as spoken by the
[7:10] prophet told me of my bridegroom's love
[7:14] for
[7:16] sure. And the king of glory yonder has
[7:21] given me his promise. And I've never

[7:56] see the bright light shine. It's just
[8:00] about home
[8:02] time. I can see my father standing at
[8:06] the
[8:08] door. This world has been a
[8:11] wilderness. I'm ready for deliverance.
[8:14] [Music]
[8:16] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[8:19] before. Verse
[8:21] three, I have heard the end time message
[8:26] as spoken by the prophet. He told me of
[8:30] my bridegroom's love for
[8:34] sure. And the king of glory on earth has
[8:39] given me his promise. And I've never

[8:59] door. This world has been a
[9:03] wilderness. I'm ready for deliverance.
[9:07] Lord, I've never been this home sick
[9:13] before.
[9:15] Amen.
[9:17] Amen. Uh let's just slide down a bit
[9:19] tonight. We'll do um the love of God is
[9:22] greater far than tongue or pen can ever
[9:24] tell. I don't know what number it is
[9:26] there, Brother
[9:28] Arman. Um a love of God, how rich, how
[9:32] pure. The love of God,
[9:34] maybe I want to do it.
[9:41] 44. It's got eight. Is that too
[9:48] low? It's too low. Hey,
[9:52] [Music]
[9:56] the love of
[9:59] God is
[10:03] greater than tongue opening.
[10:08] can ever
[10:11] tell. It goes
[10:15] beyond the highest
[10:19] star and reaches
[10:23] to the lowest
[10:26] hell. The guilty
[10:30] pair bowed down with care.
[10:36] God gave his
[10:38] [Music]
[10:39] son to
[10:42] when his airing
[10:46] child he
[10:48] [Music]
[10:50] reconciled and pardoned
[10:55] from his sin.
[10:59] Oh love of
[11:02] God, how rich and
[11:05] [Music]
[11:06] pure, how
[11:11] measureless and
[11:15] strong it shall forever.
[11:19] [Music]
[11:23] See the saints and
[11:27] [Music]
[11:32] angry
[11:34] time shall pass
[11:39] away and earthly
[11:43] thrones and kingdoms full.
[11:48] When men who
[11:51] heal refuse to
[11:55] pray on rocks and
[11:59] hills and mountains
[12:03] core, God's love so
[12:07] sure shall still
[12:11] endure all measureless
[12:17] and
[12:19] strong redeeming
[12:23] grace to Adam's
[12:27] race the saints and
[12:30] [Music]
[12:31] a yell song.
[12:36] Oh love of
[12:39] God, how rich and
[12:43] pure, how
[12:47] measurless and
[12:51] strong. It shall
[12:55] forever more endure.
[13:00] The saints
[13:03] senate held
[13:07] song. Could we
[13:11] within the ocean
[13:15] fair? And were the
[13:19] skies of parchment made?
[13:24] For every
[13:27] soul on earth
[13:31] equipped and every
[13:35] man, a scribe by
[13:39] trade to ride the
[13:43] love of God
[13:47] above would drain the earth
[13:52] and
[13:55] dry. Nor could the
[13:59] scroll contain the
[14:03] whole though stretched from
[14:07] sky to sky.
[14:12] For love of
[14:14] God, how rich and
[14:18] pure, how
[14:23] measureless and
[14:26] strong it shall
[14:31] forever more
[14:33] [Music]
[14:39] enjoy your song. Oh love of God, oh love
[14:44] of
[14:46] God, how rich and
[14:50] pure, how
[14:55] measurless and strong.
[14:59] It shall
[15:02] forever more
[15:06] endure the saints and
[15:11] angels song. One more time. For the love
[15:16] of
[15:18] God, how rich and
[15:22] pure, how
[15:26] measulous and
[15:30] strong it shall
[15:34] forever more endure.
[15:37] [Music]
[15:39] The saints
[15:40] [Music]
[15:42] sending you to
[15:45] [Music]
[16:00] song. I have a maker.
[16:06] I have a
[16:09] [Music]
[16:13] maker. He
[16:15] formed my
[16:21] heart. And
[16:23] before even
[16:25] time
[16:27] began, my
[16:29] life was
[16:31] in his hands.
[16:38] He
[16:39] knows my
[16:45] name. He
[16:47] knows my
[16:49] every thought.
[16:54] He
[16:54] sees each tear that
[16:59] PS and hears me
[17:02] when I
[17:08] go. I have a father.
[17:17] He calls me his
[17:24] own. And he'll
[17:27] never
[17:28] leave
[17:30] me. No
[17:32] matter
[17:34] where I
[17:39] go, he
[17:41] knows my name.
[17:48] He
[17:49] knows my
[17:51] every
[17:55] thought. He
[17:57] sees each
[17:59] tear that
[18:01] falls. And he hears me
[18:04] when I
[18:07] call. He knows my name.
[18:11] He knows my name.
[18:19] He knows my
[18:22] every
[18:25] thought. He
[18:27] sees each tear that
[18:31] falls and he hears me
[18:35] when I
[18:39] call. Amen. Isn't that true? Hallelujah.
[18:43] Amen. Let's just bow heads in a word of
[18:44] prayer. Gracious father, we thank you.
[18:47] You hear us when we call, Lord. And we
[18:49] don't just talk to you, you talk back to
[18:51] us. And Father, what is this great love
[18:54] divine, Lord, that you've caused us to
[18:55] become one with you, Lord, that every
[18:57] day we walk with you, Lord. And it's
[18:59] it's ultimately not by our choosing,
[19:01] it's by your choosing. Lord, you wanted
[19:03] to come down and have fellowship with us
[19:04] and make yourself known.
[19:06] Lord, we're eternally grateful, Lord,
[19:07] that we can just know you in the power
[19:09] of your resurrection, Lord, the likeness
[19:10] of your sufferings, Lord, that we don't
[19:12] have a theory. We have a living God. We
[19:15] praise your mighty name that you're
[19:16] present, Lord. You're the same
[19:18] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[19:20] Father, as we just look into your word
[19:21] now, Father, may you just increase our
[19:23] faith, Lord. Give us bulldog faith, oh
[19:26] Lord, to stand on your promises no
[19:28] matter what we see. Father, may you
[19:30] grant it for your glory. Be it those who
[19:32] couldn't be here tonight, Lord, be their
[19:33] portion. Father, go out where whoever is
[19:36] streaming the service, Lord. Go into the
[19:38] rooms they are at. And Father, may you
[19:40] be glorified in everything said and
[19:42] done. Lord, we commit the service into
[19:43] your hands. And we want to praise your
[19:45] mighty name. In Jesus Christ's name we
[19:47] ask these things. Amen.
[19:50] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[19:54] brother Isaac. Amen. Thank you,
[19:55] musicians. Amen. It's good to see
[19:57] everyone out on this dark and stormy
[20:00] night. Amen.
[20:02] No place I'd rather be though.
[20:06] Amen. Let's just go to Hebrews chapter
[20:18] 2. One of my favorite portions of
[20:21] scripture. It's hard to have a favorite
[20:23] because it's all good. But um Hebrews
[20:26] chapter 2 and we'll read uh from verse
[20:29] 9.
[20:37] Now let's read actually from verse
[20:40] five. It says, "For unto the angels hath
[20:44] he not put in subjection the world to
[20:46] come. Wherefore we speak, but one in a
[20:48] certain place
[20:50] testified, which was actually David,
[20:52] what is man that thou art mindful of
[20:55] him? Or the son of man that thou vis
[20:57] visitest visitth him? Thou madest him a
[21:00] little lower than the angels. Thou
[21:02] crowned him with the glory and honor,
[21:04] and didest set him over the works of thy
[21:06] hands. Thou has put all things in
[21:08] subjection under his feet. For in that
[21:11] he put all in subjection under him, he
[21:14] left nothing that is not put under him.
[21:16] But now we see not yet all things put
[21:19] under him, because there's still death
[21:20] in the world. But we see Jesus who was
[21:23] made a little lower than the angels for
[21:24] the suffering of death crowned with
[21:26] glory and honor that he by the grace of
[21:28] God should taste death for every man.
[21:30] For it became him for whom are all
[21:33] things and by whom all things by whom
[21:36] are all things and bringing many sons
[21:38] under glory to make the captain of their
[21:41] salvation perfect through sufferings.
[21:43] For both he that sanctifieth and they
[21:46] who are sanctified are all of one.
[21:50] uh for which cause he is not ashamed to
[21:52] call them
[21:54] brethren, saying, I will declare thy
[21:56] name unto my brethren, in the midst of
[21:58] the church will I sing praise unto thee.
[22:00] And again, I'll put my trust in him. And
[22:02] again, behold, I and the children which
[22:04] God hath given me. For as much then as
[22:06] the children are partakers of flesh and
[22:08] blood, he also himself likewise took
[22:11] part of the same, that through death he
[22:13] might destroy him that had the power of
[22:16] death, that is the devil, and deliver
[22:18] them who through fear of death were all
[22:20] their lifetime subject to bondage. For
[22:23] verily he took not on him the nature of
[22:25] angels, but he took on him the seed of
[22:26] Abraham. Wherefore in all things it
[22:28] behooved him to be made like unto his
[22:30] brethren, that he might be a merciful
[22:32] and faithful high priest in the things
[22:34] pertaining to God, to make
[22:36] reconciliation for the sins of the
[22:39] people. For in that he himself hath
[22:42] suffered being tempted, he is also able
[22:44] to to to sec um to suffer, which is help
[22:48] them that are tempted. Amen. May the
[22:50] Lord bless his word. You may you may be
[22:52] seated.
[22:54] Now I want to um let's just go to uh
[22:59] Genesis chapter 2 as well. I just want
[23:01] to read another scripture from Genesis
[23:02] chapter
[23:09] 2. It's very familiar piece of scripture
[23:12] but we'll just read from verse
[23:17] four. It says, "These are the
[23:19] generations of the heavens of the earth
[23:21] when they were created in the day that
[23:22] the Lord God made the earth in the
[23:24] heavens, and every plant of the field
[23:27] before it was in the earth, and every
[23:28] herb of the field before it grew. For
[23:31] the Lord God had not caused it to rain
[23:32] upon the earth, and there was no man to
[23:34] till the ground, but there went up a
[23:36] mist, a mist from the earth, and watered
[23:38] the whole face of the ground. And the
[23:40] Lord God formed man of the dust of the
[23:43] ground, and breathed into his nostrils
[23:45] the breath of life. and man became a
[23:48] living soul. Now we understand that uh
[23:52] Genesis chapter 2 uh Genesis chapter 1,
[23:54] he made spirit man. They put that man
[23:57] into a body. They put spirit man into a
[23:59] body. Now God, we see here it's it's
[24:02] it's interesting when you really look
[24:04] at, you know, notice it says that he
[24:07] made him out of the dust of the ground.
[24:09] And when when uh when God would would
[24:12] begin to address Ezekiel in in in
[24:14] Ezekiel chapter 2, you know, he would
[24:16] call himself um he would address Ezekiel
[24:19] as as son of man. And this and this son
[24:22] of man uh it actually uh is referring to
[24:26] uh the son of the dust. Amen. Because
[24:28] man was man was made out of the dust.
[24:31] His this physical body, dust thou art
[24:33] and dust thou shalt return. And so if
[24:36] you look at dust, it's a very
[24:38] interesting thing because, you know,
[24:39] it'll it'll move. You can you can it
[24:42] always goes to the lowest part of
[24:44] wherever it is. You sweep it, you blow
[24:45] it, it always goes down into everything.
[24:47] You know, it's it's really a it's a it's
[24:50] a formless thing. Amen. There's there's
[24:53] no real shape. It's just whatever's
[24:54] whatever's, you know, affecting it,
[24:56] it'll just form a heap or a pile. It'll
[24:58] just spread around based on whatever is
[25:00] affecting it. And it was really showing,
[25:02] God was showing in here what man would
[25:04] be like. Amen. Without something to add
[25:08] to the dust to make it into a form.
[25:10] Because you understand, you can take
[25:11] dust and you can add water into it. Then
[25:13] you can make clay. Then you can make it
[25:15] into a vessel. But without the water,
[25:17] without that added ingredient into the
[25:19] dust, it's just dust. And it just is
[25:22] just a formless thing. And God would
[25:24] take the dust of the earth and he would
[25:26] he would fashion it into a body and he
[25:28] would he would breathe into this body
[25:30] and he would put Adam the spirit man
[25:32] into this body and God would uh then
[25:36] then then he gave dominion the spirit
[25:39] man he he continue to have dominion over
[25:41] the creation. But we understand that
[25:44] when when man fell
[25:46] uh they weren't made in the likeness of
[25:48] God anymore but man was made in the
[25:50] likeness of fallen man. And you can see
[25:53] that because you know it's not very not
[25:56] that many generations. We know they
[25:58] lived a long time but it wasn't many
[26:00] generations to when there was Adam in
[26:02] the garden. Adam and Eve in the garden
[26:04] and then it comes to such a terrible
[26:06] state upon the earth that God wants to
[26:08] destroy man you know you know with Noah
[26:10] it's really not that many generations.
[26:13] And so the world and and because why?
[26:15] Because man man is the son of dust. And
[26:17] when now there wasn't that eternal life.
[26:20] There wasn't eternal life in Adam and
[26:22] Eve anymore. They were mortal flesh. And
[26:25] so being being in this fallen nature,
[26:27] even though they knew they had fallen
[26:29] from a place and and their descendants,
[26:31] they they begin to tell them testimony
[26:33] of what it was like to be in the garden.
[26:35] They, you know, and and their
[26:38] descendants were longing and looking for
[26:40] the time they would go back into Eden.
[26:42] But because they were we were they were
[26:45] men of dust. Amen. the devil could come
[26:47] along and push them around and, you
[26:49] know, cause man to do all manner of
[26:51] wicked things because there's no real
[26:53] form of man. You know, dust is dust. The
[26:56] shape that dust takes, as I said, is
[26:58] purely because of what is affecting the
[27:01] dust. Amen. But you take a bunch of clay
[27:05] and it'll stand there, you know, you you
[27:08] know, you just blow in a bit of clay,
[27:09] it'll stay a bit of clay. Amen. Because
[27:12] there's water mixed in. You understand?
[27:14] But that same pile of dust, you blow on
[27:16] it, it'll just scatter. And it's the
[27:18] same thing with man. I'm just kind of
[27:19] laboring something a little bit if you
[27:20] if it's all right. But you see, it's the
[27:22] same with man. Whatever the conditions
[27:24] are upon the earth or the popular
[27:26] culture, man will just blow with the
[27:28] culture and say this is acceptable. I'll
[27:31] do this and this is seems good and this
[27:33] is the popular opinion. What is it?
[27:35] Because their people are the man of
[27:37] dust. Amen. But now God would God would
[27:42] take these same elements that well, you
[27:45] know, maybe I should backtrack. Brother
[27:46] Bram, he said, you know, he spoke about
[27:49] people in Jeff uh uh in Jeffersonville.
[27:51] You see someone walking down the street
[27:53] and they and they think they're worth a
[27:55] million bucks, but he said they're just
[27:57] a pile of Indiana dust or or what he he
[28:00] say he also said it's volcanic ash with
[28:02] life in it. And if you've ever seen
[28:05] volcanic ash, it's just a bunch of dust.
[28:07] Amen. And he says it's just like a
[28:09] plant. It's volcanic ash with some life
[28:11] in it. But the only thing is there's a
[28:13] different kind of life in a person than
[28:14] there is in a plant. Amen. So at the end
[28:17] of the day, we're all just 60 odd
[28:19] elements with a bit of life in it. Amen.
[28:21] That's all we are. And people spend so
[28:24] much time on these bodies and they and
[28:26] they, you know, their whole life is
[28:29] selfies and look at me and I'm in shape
[28:31] and all these kind of things. But at the
[28:33] end of the day, this natural life is
[28:35] just a bunch of volcanic ashes with some
[28:38] life in it. Amen. But there's another
[28:42] part of man which is the important part
[28:44] of man, and that is the soul of man.
[28:46] Animals don't have souls. Amen. Your dog
[28:50] doesn't have a soul. Your pig doesn't
[28:51] have a soul. Whatever animals you have,
[28:53] your cat doesn't have a soul.
[28:55] Chimpanzees don't have souls. Only man
[28:57] has a soul. And you can see that because
[28:59] chimpanzees, I probably said this a
[29:01] while ago, but you know what a
[29:03] chimpanzeee did in the in the days of
[29:06] Jesus, their great great great great
[29:10] great offspring chimpanzeee does the
[29:12] same thing that that chimpanzeee did.
[29:14] But man, in the days of Jesus, we
[29:17] weren't we weren't in space. Now we're
[29:18] in space. They didn't have the internet.
[29:20] Now we have the internet. Why? Because
[29:22] man has a soul. He's trying to he's
[29:24] trying to always advance
[29:25] himself. And so, so when when when Adam
[29:30] fell, then they weren't the sons of God
[29:32] anymore. They fell from their position
[29:34] and they truly became the sons of Adam.
[29:37] So they were they were sons of the dust.
[29:39] They were sons of men. And so Jesus now,
[29:42] he he took those same elements that
[29:44] everyone else was born with. Amen. He
[29:46] was born with the same kind of body.
[29:48] Amen. But it wasn't a fallen body. But
[29:50] it had had the same kind of brain. You
[29:52] had the same kind of hands and feet and
[29:54] heart and all kinds of things. You know,
[29:56] he had all those things. He took those
[29:58] same kind of elements. But he was going
[30:00] to show to the devil that this dust, you
[30:03] know, because he caused man to fall to
[30:05] this position of of of depravity. But
[30:09] God was going to show I'm going to take
[30:10] those same same kind of man. Amen. But
[30:13] of course, he was born without sin. He
[30:15] didn't have a fallen nature like you and
[30:17] I were born with. But then God would
[30:19] take those kind of elements. He'd make a
[30:21] man like we are made. Amen. And he would
[30:24] show that a man of dust is going to
[30:25] bring a redemption. Amen. Amen. A man of
[30:28] dust is going to take this take this
[30:30] fallen fallen creation and take it back
[30:33] up to what it's meant to be. You
[30:35] following me? Amen. So you see the
[30:37] prophets, you know, the difference
[30:38] between Moses and Pharaoh is Moses
[30:42] wasn't a man of dust anymore because he
[30:45] wasn't just clay. He wasn't just dust,
[30:47] but he had he had life in him. I mean,
[30:50] God, it was God and Moses going down
[30:54] into Egypt. Cuz you read in Exodus
[30:56] chapter 3, there's the burning bush. God
[30:58] speaks out the burning bush and he says,
[31:00] "I have heard the cries of my people. I
[31:02] have come down to deliver them and I'm
[31:05] sending you." And the simplest thing is
[31:07] was he says, "I've come down. I'm going
[31:09] to go in you to deliver my people."
[31:11] Amen. Because Moses, you know, there's
[31:13] some things he says, you know, just
[31:15] raise up God, you know, just raise up
[31:16] his staff and and and frogs come or
[31:18] fleas come or he tells Aaron to do
[31:21] certain things and the river goes to
[31:22] blood and but then when they're when
[31:24] they're there by the Red Sea and it's
[31:26] amazing because when you read the
[31:28] account, you know how they came out of
[31:29] Egypt and then they're coming down to
[31:31] the Red Sea and God tells them to go a
[31:33] certain way to end up in that spot and
[31:35] then they see the Phil uh the the the
[31:38] Egyptian army coming to destroy them and
[31:40] said it's going to be and it looked like
[31:41] it's going be the greatest massacre
[31:43] there ever had been upon the face of the
[31:44] earth. And all the people are saying to
[31:47] to Moses, "Have you brought us out here
[31:49] to die?" You know, and then he speaks
[31:52] these words. He says, he says, "These
[31:54] Egyptians, you see, this day will be the
[31:57] last day you'll see them." I'm not
[31:58] saying it verbatim. This is basically
[31:59] what he says. You won't see this enemy
[32:02] anymore.
[32:04] But then, but then he's But then, so
[32:06] he's all worried and then God speaks and
[32:09] says, "Why Christ speak and move
[32:10] forward? you know, why are you worrying?
[32:13] So, there's one. So, so in one instance,
[32:15] he's prophesying, you won't see these
[32:16] enemies again. And the very next
[32:18] instance, he's saying, "How are we going
[32:19] to get out of this mess?"
[32:22] Amen. And that's much like you and I.
[32:24] Amen. We know. We know he's under the
[32:27] blood of bulls and goats, but the same
[32:29] life that was in him is in you. And
[32:31] Moses was a man like we're men. Amen.
[32:34] Moses had a temper like some of us used
[32:36] to have a temper. Hallelujah. You know,
[32:38] yeah. He he he he had battles like we
[32:42] have battles. Amen. Amen. Brother Bram
[32:44] said that he was on the back side of the
[32:46] desert. God took 40 years to get Egypt
[32:49] out of Moses. And what did he use? He
[32:52] used he used a hotteered wife and he
[32:55] used a bunch of sheep on the back side
[32:57] of the desert and in in sometimes very
[33:00] hard conditions. So he used the
[33:02] everyday.
[33:04] Amen. To get Moses out of Moses. Amen.
[33:06] Amen. And so when we step into a trial,
[33:09] we should just say, "Thank you, Lord.
[33:10] You're trying to get me out of me."
[33:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Because remember, he
[33:14] doesn't finish molding you after you
[33:16] receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. You're
[33:18] still being refined and your character
[33:19] is being molded and you know, so he's
[33:22] still, you know, so so he spent 40 years
[33:25] to get Moses out of Moses. Then he could
[33:27] use Moses. Now, we don't have 40 years.
[33:29] I mean, God wants to use us right now.
[33:32] But you see there was a there was such a
[33:34] dual part you know where where where
[33:36] Moses you would say things and it wasn't
[33:38] Moses speaking it was God speaking but
[33:41] then but then it went back from it went
[33:43] from God and Moses but then it went to
[33:46] Moses again and and the people were
[33:49] getting confused because they got so
[33:51] caught up in the man and they saw the
[33:53] failures of the man and they saw how he
[33:55] was and it's always the veil that God
[33:59] presents himself through is the thing
[34:01] that People stumble with like Jesus. He
[34:04] wasn't a man. You know, the scripture
[34:06] tells us that when we saw him, listen in
[34:08] Isaiah 53. When we saw him, there was
[34:10] nothing of him that we would desire him.
[34:12] See, he wasn't a big handsome. You know,
[34:14] you see the pictures, he's blonde head
[34:15] and six foot and strong and, you know,
[34:18] he wasn't that kind of guy. He didn't
[34:20] look like a king, but he had the
[34:22] character and nature of the King of
[34:24] Kings cuz he was the King of Kings.
[34:26] Amen. But it was always you it was the
[34:28] veil and you know he you know he's
[34:29] raised in a poor place and the scribes
[34:31] and Pharisees they thought if if if the
[34:33] Messiah was going to come he would be
[34:35] out of their Bible school he would be a
[34:37] rich guy and he would have a wonderful
[34:39] family lineage and all these kind of
[34:40] things you know but so Moses is there I
[34:44] just want to go back to that because
[34:45] Moses was there and he said you won't
[34:47] see them again. He had no idea what was
[34:49] going to happen. God told them to God
[34:51] told him to walk down this way and
[34:54] sometimes God says go do certain things
[34:56] and we follow him and then we say what's
[34:58] going on.
[35:00] Hello. Have we been there? Amen. God
[35:03] tells you do this and go here and you
[35:04] should do this and then you come down to
[35:06] that spot like Moses cuz you like let's
[35:10] go to Exodus. Let's just read this. I
[35:12] want to show you
[35:13] this because they didn't just because a
[35:16] lot of perception in Christianity or you
[35:18] know when you watch Bible movies and
[35:20] stuff you just think that they they flee
[35:22] from Egypt and they just run as fast as
[35:24] they can and then oh here's the Red Sea.
[35:27] Oh we got lost. No, God ordered their
[35:29] footsteps.
[35:36] Now see if we can find it.
[35:41] Yes. Now, it's in chapter
[35:47] 14. And verse one. So, I want you to
[35:50] notice God tells him exactly where to
[35:52] go.
[35:54] Yep. And normally when God tells you to
[35:56] do something, you're like, "Yep." You
[35:57] know, you're all like, "Let's gung-ho
[35:59] and let's charge in and let me get the
[36:01] first blood." And, you know, you jump
[36:02] and you want to be in the first one in
[36:04] the charge. Yeah. Because you're all
[36:06] gung-ho because you think, you know,
[36:07] gung-ho, you're all together. you
[36:09] haven't heard. Anyway, Exodus 14:1, and
[36:12] the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak
[36:13] unto the children of Israel, that they
[36:16] turn and encamp, now forgive me when I
[36:18] trip over all these words, before fire
[36:22] hath Lauren, between Mdul and the sea,
[36:25] over against Baal, Zephan, before it
[36:28] shall you encamp by the sea. For me, for
[36:31] Pharaoh will say to the children of
[36:33] Israel, they are entangled in the land,
[36:35] the wilderness has shut them in. and
[36:37] I'll harden Pharaoh's heart, and he
[36:39] shall follow after them. And I'll be
[36:41] honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[36:43] host, that the Egyptians may know that I
[36:45] am the Lord." And they did so. So God
[36:48] tells him, you go here, you encamp here
[36:50] by the sea. This is where you're going.
[36:52] Yeah. So they didn't just, it wasn't a
[36:54] mad dash out of Egypt. Let's run and
[36:55] here we are. How did we get to this
[36:57] spot? And then now, let's just just just
[37:00] drop
[37:02] down and we'll read from verse
[37:05] 10. They say you just go to verse 9. But
[37:08] the Egyptians pursued after them all the
[37:10] horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his
[37:11] horsemen and his army and overtook them
[37:14] and camping by the sea beside Fhath
[37:17] Lauren which we just read before Baal
[37:20] Zephan. So they were exactly where they
[37:22] meant to be. Yeah. And when Pharaoh drew
[37:26] nigh, and the children of Israel lifted
[37:27] up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians
[37:30] marched after them, and they were sore
[37:31] afraid, and the children of Israel cried
[37:35] unto the Lord. They said unto Moses,
[37:37] because there was no graves in Egypt,
[37:39] hast thou taken us away to die in the
[37:41] wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dwelt
[37:43] thus with us, to carry us forth out of
[37:47] Egypt? Is not this the word that we did
[37:49] tell thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us
[37:51] alone, that we may serve the Egyptians,
[37:53] for it had been better for us to serve
[37:55] the Egyptians, than we should die in the
[37:58] wilderness." And Moses said unto the
[38:00] people, "Fear ye not. Stand still and
[38:02] see the salvation of the Lord, which he
[38:05] will show to you today. For the
[38:08] Egyptians whom you have seen today, you
[38:11] shall see them again no more forever."
[38:14] He didn't know he was going to open the
[38:15] sea up.
[38:17] Amen. But notice, God told them to go
[38:19] this direction. Moses could have said,
[38:22] "This is where we're going. Here's the
[38:24] map. This is where God says we're going
[38:25] to go, and this is and then they get to
[38:27] the spot, they say, "Why have you
[38:29] brought us out here to
[38:30] die?" Where's the confidence?
[38:33] Amen. But we come to those spots, too.
[38:36] God tells us to do specific things, and
[38:38] then we come to the spot, he doesn't
[38:40] lead you in into a death trap. God
[38:43] doesn't lead you into the death trap. He
[38:45] leads you in what you may think is a
[38:47] death trap, but it's not your death
[38:48] trap. It's Satan's death trap. Amen. He
[38:51] brought he brought them that way because
[38:54] he wanted he wanted to drown them in the
[38:57] Red Sea. He wanted to destroy them that
[39:00] they would know that there was a
[39:02] demarcation where the enemy that they
[39:04] once were in bondage to had been
[39:06] destroyed. Amen. Amen. They wanted He
[39:08] wanted them to realize that they didn't
[39:10] have to live in fear from the slave
[39:12] masters of Egypt anymore cuz I'm going
[39:14] to drown them and you're going to watch
[39:16] them be drowned. Hallelujah. It's the
[39:18] same thing. We come out of Egypt the
[39:20] world and we get scared. Oh, I'll get
[39:22] entangled back into it. But then God
[39:24] comes along. He says, "I'm going to show
[39:26] you a time where you can literally mark
[39:28] the grave of your enemy." Amen. Because
[39:31] these enemies that once afflicted you
[39:33] are not going to afflict you anymore.
[39:34] Hallelujah. Amen. And he wants to see he
[39:37] wants you to watch. He he could have
[39:38] basically said to them when they
[39:40] crossed, he said, "Now you see this
[39:42] area. See see this kind of valley? It's
[39:44] like a
[39:45] grandstand. You just you just go up
[39:47] there. You watch. Make some popcorn.
[39:50] Watch it unfold. I'm not I trust I'm not
[39:53] I'm not trying to say it as a joke, but
[39:54] he he wanted them to see their enemy
[39:56] drown." That's right. Amen. He wanted
[39:58] them to recognize the enemy is dead.
[40:01] Now Now, but notice this verse 14.
[40:05] Remember this is like us. We're men of
[40:07] dust. Remember there's this this body is
[40:10] we're still looking for a body change.
[40:12] So we still live in this thing. Yeah.
[40:15] These five senses our emotional realm.
[40:18] We still live with this guy. But this
[40:21] guy is your enemy.
[40:24] This guy. What do you mean? How can I
[40:26] I'm not I'm not talking about you're not
[40:27] schizophrenic now. You understand? But
[40:30] this man this man the emotional man he
[40:33] is your enemy. because he will declare
[40:35] things to you that are contrary to this
[40:37] guy. And this God is always right. Amen.
[40:42] That's why the scripture tells us to
[40:43] cast down reasoning. Amen. Cast down
[40:46] everything that exalts itself above the
[40:47] word of God. Amen. That's what Paul, you
[40:50] know, instructed the people. Just cast
[40:51] it down. What does that mean? Chuck it
[40:54] on the ground. Have nothing. Don't just
[40:56] put it down. You just cast it down.
[40:58] Disregard it. Amen. Amen. Because
[41:01] remember, we're a man of dust. And if
[41:04] we're not careful, we'll go with the
[41:06] wind. But there's but there's been water
[41:08] added. Amen. There's been something to
[41:11] mold us and shape us and the Holy
[41:13] Spirit's dwelled in us that we're not
[41:15] dust anymore. Amen. But we're living
[41:17] tabernacles of the living God. So
[41:20] there's something in us that's stronger
[41:21] than whatever the winds blow. It's
[41:23] stronger than whatever the world tries
[41:24] to do. There's something in us that's
[41:26] stronger than whatever is is is
[41:28] afflicting us. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[41:31] See, now he says, "The Lord shall fight
[41:33] for you, and you shall hold your peace."
[41:36] This, now we're in verse 14. This is
[41:38] Moses. And then verse 15, "And the Lord
[41:41] said unto
[41:42] Moses, why for Christ thou unto me?"
[41:46] Look, so he's just said this. You see
[41:48] these guys, you won't see them tomorrow.
[41:51] You will see them no more forever. That
[41:53] was the promise. That was God speaking
[41:55] through them. Yeah. But then now the
[41:58] Lord, but then
[41:59] obviously, see, see that was God and
[42:02] Moses, but now Moses and Moses begins to
[42:04] get worried. The flesh man begins to get
[42:06] worried because he's got responsibility.
[42:09] He's got a million odd people that he's
[42:11] brought out. He's got God's people that,
[42:13] you know, you know that he's brought out
[42:14] of Egypt. And we always feel human
[42:17] responsibility. But he just he told
[42:19] them, "The Lord shall fight for you. You
[42:21] shall hold your peace." Amen. So you're
[42:23] not going to do this. If you're not
[42:25] going to fight them, the Lord will fight
[42:27] for you. Remember, he's the same
[42:29] yesterday, today, and forever.
[42:32] And the Lord said unto Moses, why for
[42:34] Christ thou unto me? Why are you
[42:37] worried? This is what he's saying. Why
[42:39] are you crying? Why? Speak unto the
[42:42] children of Israel that they go forward.
[42:46] Amen. So there can come times in life
[42:48] where we're walking with the Lord, but
[42:50] then circumstances come, situations
[42:52] come, and it actually puts a halt to our
[42:55] march. Amen. We've all been there. Amen.
[42:59] But he says, he says, "Don't cry unto
[43:00] me. Just speak and move forward." Amen.
[43:03] Take the promise. Remember, his promise
[43:06] was, "I'm going to take you from Egypt.
[43:07] I'm going to put you in the promised
[43:09] land." That was the promise. And they
[43:11] just had to keep the promise in front of
[43:13] them. Amen. There's going to be a
[43:16] rapture. Us and our children will be
[43:18] there. Amen. You and your seed will be
[43:20] there. The word says that my word will
[43:23] not depart out of your mouth or your
[43:25] seed's mouth or your seed seed's mouth.
[43:27] So that means that the word will not
[43:29] depart out of your ch your mouth or your
[43:31] children's or your grandchildren should
[43:32] you have them. That's a promise in
[43:34] Isaiah. Amen. That's the promise. Amen.
[43:37] That's what he said. So he says he says
[43:40] speak and move forward. So don't don't
[43:42] don't don't stop where you're going.
[43:46] Amen. Why do obstacles come? Why did the
[43:49] Red Sea come? To kill to to drown the
[43:52] enemy. That was the only reason that
[43:55] obstacle was there. Amen. Why do trials
[43:59] come? Why do obstacles come? To kill the
[44:02] enemy. Amen. Amen. for you. You know,
[44:05] you'd think they had all these miracles
[44:06] in Egypt, then they come down to a spot
[44:09] and then God opens the Red Sea. You
[44:11] would think these people would have so
[44:13] much confidence. Look at what God wasn't
[44:16] that long ago. Remember, two days before
[44:18] this, they were slaves
[44:20] or how Yeah, it wasn't that long before
[44:22] two I think about two days they were
[44:24] slaves. Now, they were dancing on the
[44:26] other side of the Red Sea under the
[44:28] inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
[44:30] rejoicing because the enemy had just
[44:31] been killed.
[44:33] you. And and when they walked over the
[44:35] Red Sea, it says they walked like upon
[44:37] dry ground. Yes. They weren't bogged
[44:40] down walking.
[44:42] Amen. Remember this really happened.
[44:44] This is not some figurative or isn't
[44:46] this a nice story? This literally
[44:47] happened. Amen. This happened like we're
[44:50] having church right now. Amen. This
[44:53] literally happened. And he's the same
[44:55] yesterday, today, and forever.
[44:58] Amen.
[45:00] And then so he says, "But lift up thy
[45:02] rod and stretch out thine arm over the
[45:05] sea and divide it, and the children of
[45:08] Israel shall go on dry ground through
[45:10] the midst of the sea." You see? So why?
[45:14] So why' the obstacle come to kill those
[45:16] guys to kill to kill the Egyptians?
[45:20] Yeah. And why do trials come that it
[45:23] would take fear out of you? You
[45:26] understand? because you have to come to
[45:28] a point and we'll read it in Hebrews 11
[45:31] where Sarah maybe let's just read it
[45:33] before I misquote the
[45:35] scripture the
[45:42] time our God is God he is the Lord Amen
[45:47] he's in control Amen he's in control of
[45:50] everything that's why I just I just want
[45:52] to get that across Amen God that led
[45:55] them out is the same God that revealed
[45:57] himself to a prophet and that same God
[45:59] is present here. That's why we have that
[46:01] pillar of fire photograph is that to
[46:04] show that that same pillar of fire in
[46:05] the burning bush is the same one that
[46:07] revealed himself through the Old
[46:08] Testament. The same one that came and
[46:10] dwelt and Jesus became a man. The same
[46:12] one came in the upper room and filled
[46:13] the 120 in the days of you know in the
[46:16] day of Pentecost. The same one today.
[46:19] Amen. Cuz he did the same things. Amen.
[46:23] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Bram, I was
[46:25] just hearing a bit of message in the in
[46:27] the in the car. I can't remember what
[46:28] sermon it is, but he said about how the
[46:31] how Jesus revealed the thoughts and
[46:34] tents of the hearts of the Jews and the
[46:36] Samaritans. And he said, "God is not a
[46:39] God of partiality. So if he does it to
[46:41] those people, he's got to do it to the
[46:43] Gentiles." Because there's three races
[46:44] of people upon
[46:45] the earth. Can I hold up three fingers?
[46:48] There's the Jew, Gentile, and
[46:50] Samaritan. Yeah. Sorry, I'm getting old.
[46:53] They're getting funny. I don't know. You
[46:56] know what I mean? And so he had to do it
[46:58] to the Gentiles. And then in that same
[47:01] sermon, what happens? He says, "Now he's
[47:03] here." And he and he begins to call
[47:05] people out saying, "This is your name.
[47:07] This is where you're from. This is" and
[47:08] he's doing, he said, "The same God that
[47:10] was back there is now here." And so that
[47:12] same angel of the Lord came into the
[47:14] meeting and revealed himself saying, and
[47:16] he said, "Now we're waiting for the sign
[47:18] of the Messiah." Amen. The sign of the
[47:21] resurrection. And that's and that was
[47:23] what what was happening when when God
[47:25] would reveal the thoughts and tents of
[47:27] the hearts of the people said this is
[47:28] the messianic sign. This is the sign of
[47:31] the Messiah. Amen. Amen. To show he's
[47:34] the same God. That's why we have that
[47:36] photograph because that same God that
[47:37] was back there. Cuz how do you know he's
[47:38] the same? Because he did the same things
[47:40] he did back there. That proves he's the
[47:42] same God.
[47:44] And then will you say, "Well, that's
[47:45] just signs and wonders." It vindicates
[47:47] this. Amen. Amen. And a further
[47:50] vindication, this is the same God you
[47:52] read about in here comes and dwells in
[47:53] you and lives the same life. Now,
[47:57] Hebrews 11 and and
[48:00] verse, let's just read from verse 8. By
[48:03] faith
[48:04] Abraham when he was called to go out
[48:07] into a place which he would after
[48:10] receive an inheritance obeyed and he
[48:12] went out not knowing whether he went by
[48:15] faith he sojourned in a land of promise
[48:17] as in a strange country dwelling in the
[48:20] tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the
[48:22] heirs with him of the same promise for
[48:24] he looked for a city which hath
[48:26] foundations whose builder and maker is
[48:28] God. Through faith also Sarah herself
[48:33] received strength to conceive seed and
[48:36] was delivered of a child when she was
[48:38] yet past age because she judged him
[48:42] faithful who had promised.
[48:45] Amen. So she she had to come to a
[48:50] place the same place you have to come to
[48:54] where you judge him faithful. Amen.
[48:57] Because remember Sarah is a type of the
[48:59] church in the last day. Amen. Suffering
[49:01] the reproach, being out of the world,
[49:04] not living naturally as as wonderfully
[49:06] as the other churches do like Lot and
[49:09] all those down in Sodom. Amen. But there
[49:11] has to come a point where we judge him
[49:14] faithful.
[49:15] Amen. where you see brother Baron he
[49:17] preaches a sermon works is faith
[49:19] expressed 1965 and he says the the works
[49:23] you live or the life you lived is a
[49:25] revelation of your faith amen because
[49:28] man God sees your faith and man sees
[49:30] your works or your life that you live
[49:33] and he and he and I don't have it on me
[49:35] but if you go listen to it he says
[49:37] basically now I'm going to show you that
[49:40] what I believe is true so he says
[49:44] basically I'm going to show you cuz
[49:45] works his faith expressed. So, I'm going
[49:47] to show you the works that prove my
[49:49] faith in in what I believe. And he talks
[49:52] about the angel of the Lord. And then he
[49:54] comes down and he proves himself over
[49:56] and over again supernaturally. Amen. I
[49:59] mean to prove that the same God that was
[50:00] back there is here. Amen. Amen. But then
[50:05] there has to come to a point because
[50:07] because he had to know who he was. Now
[50:10] the prophet had to know who he was. You
[50:13] have to know who you are. Who you are.
[50:15] Amen. And how did he know? He said if
[50:18] it's God, speaking of the discernment
[50:19] and everything in the visions, he says
[50:21] if it's God, it will never fail.
[50:23] Amen. So he judged him faithful.
[50:27] He says he hasn't failed one time. He
[50:30] judged him faithful. Now you have to
[50:32] judge him faithful. Amen. The Lord.
[50:34] Amen. Brother judged Jesus Christ
[50:36] faithful. Amen. To back up his word.
[50:39] That's right. Now you have to judge him
[50:41] faithful. Amen. Amen. You have to judge
[50:44] him faithful. And whatever he has
[50:46] promised to you, you have to judge it
[50:48] faithful.
[50:49] Amen. You have to judge him faithful
[50:51] because it says in another part of the
[50:54] book of Hebrews, it says when an oath is
[50:56] confirmed, there is a cease of all
[50:58] strife. Amen. So what does that mean? So
[51:01] it means if I promise something to you
[51:04] and then I confirm it, you don't need to
[51:06] worry because you know I'm going to do
[51:08] what I said. Amen. And that's speaking
[51:11] of Abraham as well. When a when an oath
[51:13] is confirmed, there's it cease from all
[51:15] strife. So when the Lord because this is
[51:18] the Lord's oath. This is a promise to
[51:20] you. Amen. This is a promise to you.
[51:24] It's a love letter to you. But the the
[51:28] battle comes in. It's not if this is
[51:31] true. Amen. The battle comes into is
[51:35] actually well, do you believe it to be
[51:36] true? Because this has been proven.
[51:39] That's right. We got 11 just you just
[51:41] take the you know the last hundred
[51:43] years. We have we have so much proven
[51:48] evidence that this is true. And then you
[51:51] can then they go back and then you go
[51:52] back further and you go back even the
[51:54] days of Jesus. They dig down in the Holy
[51:56] Land. They just found a graveyard of the
[51:58] Philistines and you know they find all
[52:00] of the all of the civilizations
[52:02] everything that is talked about in the
[52:03] Old Testament. That's like the Hittites
[52:05] that were in the Old Testament. One of
[52:07] the nations that Israel fought against.
[52:09] People scoffed at it saying, "Well,
[52:11] there's no such thing as the Hittite
[52:13] nation." And then they go digging around
[52:15] then and they find them. Amen. It's been
[52:19] proven that it's true. But it has to be
[52:22] proven. But remember, when the oath is
[52:24] confirmed, there's a seat. You cease
[52:26] from all strife. So you cease from all
[52:28] worry and torment. And is it true? Is it
[52:30] really true? But when it's confirmed to
[52:32] you,
[52:34] you understand? When he confirms his his
[52:37] oath to
[52:38] you, that's when we can cease. That's
[52:40] when we can know he promised it. I
[52:43] believe it. That settles it. Amen. Amen.
[52:48] Because now there's this. Now you can
[52:49] rest. And that's what Israel should have
[52:52] done. Well, he brought us out of Egypt.
[52:54] That's right. The death angel couldn't
[52:55] touch us because we put the blood on the
[52:57] door and the lentil. And he said that we
[52:59] would come out in a mighty hand and we
[53:01] would spoil the Egyptians. And look,
[53:02] they gave us you you go read it on that
[53:05] on that night when the death angel came.
[53:07] The Egyptians came and gave them all
[53:08] their gold and all these things, all
[53:10] their jewelry. Take it, go. And they
[53:11] said, "Be gone." And they spoiled them.
[53:14] They came out with a mighty hand. Now,
[53:17] if they really had confidence cuz God,
[53:20] what God wasn't just just just bringing
[53:23] judgment upon Egypt, he was building
[53:26] confidence in his people. That's what
[53:29] he's wanted to do. He's wanted to show
[53:30] this is me. I'm Jehovah God. Look, I'm
[53:33] greater than the God of the Nile. I'm
[53:35] greater than the God of the, you know,
[53:37] you know, the frogs and the flies and
[53:39] the and the sun and everything. Every
[53:41] plague that was poured out was actually
[53:44] a plague upon one of the Egyptian gods.
[53:47] Cuz God was showing, I'm greater than
[53:49] all these all the gods in this country.
[53:51] I'm greater than this country. Yeah. And
[53:54] he was trying to build confidence in his
[53:56] people that I am the Lord God and
[53:58] there's nothing there's no one beside
[54:00] me. And to me that should have been, you
[54:03] know, you know, for some of them like
[54:04] Caleb and Joshua, there's a cease from
[54:06] all strife cuz he confirmed his oath to
[54:09] them. Amen. Amen. You understand? And it
[54:13] has to be the same thing with us. We
[54:14] have to judge him. There comes a point
[54:17] that we have to judge him faithful.
[54:20] Amen. in every situation. Just remember,
[54:22] if he's done something, has he done
[54:24] something for you?
[54:26] Amen. If he has he if he's done
[54:28] something for you, he didn't just do it
[54:31] just to say, "Well, here's some sincere
[54:32] people. I'm going to shake some trinkets
[54:35] in front of them, make them a bit
[54:36] religious." He was wanting to build
[54:38] confidence.
[54:40] Amen. that he is the Lord God and he and
[54:43] and and he loves you and he wants to
[54:45] build confidence that doesn't matter
[54:47] what happens in life you can say I know
[54:49] my redeemer lives. Amen. Amen. Because
[54:52] Job said even if he slays me yet I'll
[54:55] trust him. So Job Job wasn't depending
[54:58] on well I have everything good therefore
[55:00] the Lord loves me. He says even if he
[55:01] slays me I'll trust him anyway.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:08] We have to I trust you've you've come to
[55:12] that place where you've judged him
[55:13] faithful. If he was faithful back then,
[55:16] he still remember he's the same
[55:18] yesterday, today, and
[55:20] forever. What did he do for you
[55:22] yesterday? Did he help you yesterday?
[55:25] You called upon his name and he
[55:26] delivered you yesterday. He guided your
[55:28] steps yesterday. He answered your
[55:30] questions yesterday. He gave you peace
[55:32] yesterday. What has he done today? He's
[55:34] delivered you today. He's answered your
[55:36] questions today. You know, he's guided
[55:37] your steps today. What's he going to do
[55:39] forever? Exactly what he's done before.
[55:42] Amen. It is what it is. Hallelujah. So
[55:46] God and that's why Jesus now I'm going
[55:48] to that's why Jesus we read there in
[55:51] Hebrews chapter 2 that he took on he
[55:53] didn't take upon him a form of a man. I
[55:55] mean I mean sorry a formative form of an
[55:57] angel. He took upon himself the form of
[56:00] a man like us. Amen. because he was
[56:04] going to demonstrate to Satan. He was
[56:07] going to be and he called himself son of
[56:09] man, son of the dust. Amen. And he said,
[56:13] "Now, I'm going to take these elements
[56:15] and I'm going to demonstrate to
[56:18] Satan that that I can that that a man
[56:22] can defeat Satan anytime, any place,
[56:24] anywhere by the word." Amen. Remember he
[56:27] didn't he when when Jesus was led into
[56:30] the wilderness and it's interesting you
[56:32] got to you got to remember Jesus comes
[56:34] down to the river Jordan he's baptized
[56:37] spirit of God descends upon him like a
[56:39] dove fullness of Godhead bodily and
[56:42] where does now remember he was a
[56:44] prisoner to the spirit in him just like
[56:46] we're to be prisoners to the spirit in
[56:48] us. Amen. Yep. So the spirit in him
[56:51] actually led him into the wilderness to
[56:53] be tempted. It didn't take him to a nice
[56:57] wonderful place. Amen. It took him into
[57:01] the wilderness to be tempted by the
[57:03] devil. Yeah. And sometimes we have a
[57:06] glorious time. Then where do we go? Oh,
[57:09] we find ourselves in the desert.
[57:12] Amen. We do. Why is this happening?
[57:15] Because we had a glorious time there.
[57:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So
[57:21] now, but then you see he didn't use his
[57:23] great power against the devil. He quoted
[57:26] from the scripture. I mean, when he
[57:28] said, "Ma, man shall not live by bread
[57:30] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[57:32] out of the mouth of God," that's in
[57:33] Deuteronomy. He didn't just pick words
[57:36] out of the air, that was something that
[57:37] Moses said. Yeah. And he quoted the
[57:40] scripture. And by quoting the scripture,
[57:42] he defeated the devil.
[57:45] Amen. And that's what And he was doing
[57:48] that. And you probably heard this many
[57:49] times, but he did that to prove that
[57:52] that is what we can do. Amen. Because
[57:55] the same God, he was the fullness of God
[57:57] here bodily. And then he comes and
[57:59] dwells in us. So the same life that was
[58:02] in him is in us. Amen. Is it not the
[58:05] same? The same. He said, "It's not me
[58:08] that doeth the works, but the father
[58:09] that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[58:11] works." Amen. And then you should be
[58:12] able to look at your life and how you
[58:14] live and and the things that come out of
[58:15] your mouth and what you do and you say,
[58:17] "It's not me that doeth the works." So
[58:19] it's not me that lives this life. It's
[58:20] the father that dwelleth in me. He lives
[58:22] the life. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[58:25] then so he was proving
[58:28] this because he was there 40 days and he
[58:32] was hungry. And then Satan Satan came at
[58:35] his lowest point. Yeah. Satan came at a
[58:39] low point. He says, "If you be, if
[58:42] you're re," and we'll bring it into our
[58:43] day's language. If you're really a
[58:45] believer, turn the circumstance around
[58:49] because it's written, "Whatsoever you
[58:51] ask, it shall be."
[58:54] Amen. But he said, he said, "You shall
[58:57] not tempt you." He said, "Get behind me,
[58:59] Satan." Amen. And he used the word and
[59:03] he defeated the word, quoted the word
[59:04] and defeated Satan. Amen. Amen. And if
[59:07] he can do it, doesn't matter what age we
[59:10] are, we have the right to do it. Because
[59:12] he is demonstrating this is how man
[59:14] gains victory over the devil.
[59:18] Amen. It's so simple, but yet if we
[59:20] could just grasp it a little bit, he
[59:22] gained victory over the devil by quoting
[59:24] his quoting the word back at him. And
[59:27] then Satan took some of the scripture
[59:29] and actually twisted it a little
[59:31] bit. Amen. He did. And then he quoted it
[59:34] back at him. And then Jesus quoted the
[59:37] word back at him. Amen.
[59:40] Yeah. Because they're showing this is
[59:42] how you get victory.
[59:44] Why did Why do you think God told Moses,
[59:47] "Why cry to me? Speak and move forward."
[59:51] Hallelujah. Speak the word and move
[59:53] forward.
[59:55] Amen. Remember, he's the same yesterday,
[59:57] today, and forever. That's why it's
[1:00:00] important when things are going haywire.
[1:00:04] Don't go to here. Go to here. Go to
[1:00:08] here. Amen. Lord, what do you say? It
[1:00:11] doesn't matter if you can't even You
[1:00:13] don't remember. I'll put it this way.
[1:00:15] You don't have to quote this word for
[1:00:17] word
[1:00:18] verbatim.
[1:00:20] Amen. You say, "Lord, you said I'd have
[1:00:23] peace, not as the world gives. I Lord,
[1:00:25] I've got a different kind of peace than
[1:00:26] the world has." Well, that's not word
[1:00:28] for word, but it's what it says. Amen.
[1:00:31] You understand? You don't need to. Oh,
[1:00:33] what does it say? You say, Lord, this is
[1:00:34] your promise. Thank you, Lord. You'll
[1:00:36] never leave me nor forsake me. It
[1:00:38] doesn't matter if you don't know where.
[1:00:40] Said, Lord, you you said you'll be my
[1:00:42] shepherd. You're my shepherd, Lord. That
[1:00:44] means you'll guide me. You'll look after
[1:00:46] me. Amen. Amen. Then what have And then
[1:00:50] that I I tell you, you use that in faith
[1:00:54] and you'll defeat whatever's coming
[1:00:55] against you. Remember, because we do not
[1:00:57] wrestle against flesh and blood, but
[1:01:00] against
[1:01:02] demon powers in high places, spiritual
[1:01:05] wickedness in high places.
[1:01:08] Amen. So now, so he was doing that to
[1:01:12] show it doesn't say take some great
[1:01:15] mighty
[1:01:16] power. What we think of power is very
[1:01:18] different to really what God is was
[1:01:20] showing because that was God
[1:01:21] demonstrating his mighty power because
[1:01:23] whenever the enemy the enemy came
[1:01:25] against Moses and and used his temper at
[1:01:28] a weak spot. Yeah, because the people
[1:01:32] were rebelling. He was getting angry.
[1:01:34] Remember there was there was there was
[1:01:35] Moses the man. And there and when God
[1:01:38] came in, that was now God and
[1:01:40] Moses. But remember the enemy I mean,
[1:01:43] sorry. Well, the people were were were
[1:01:46] rebelling. Look, we're thirsty. We need
[1:01:47] water and we're hungry and all these
[1:01:49] things. And it worn them down, worn them
[1:01:51] down, worn them down. And then God told
[1:01:53] him, actually, just speak to the rock
[1:01:55] cuz he already smitten it and water will
[1:01:57] come out of it. But he takes the rod and
[1:01:59] he and he and he smites the rock again.
[1:02:02] He says, "You bunch of rebels, do do I
[1:02:04] have to bring water forth for you?"
[1:02:06] Amen. What happened? His temp. Remember,
[1:02:09] he was worn down to a place. He was at a
[1:02:12] weak spot and the devil used his temper
[1:02:16] against him and caused him not to go
[1:02:18] into the promised
[1:02:20] land. Amen. Remember that was under the
[1:02:23] blood of bulls and goats.
[1:02:25] We have a different
[1:02:27] sacrifice that we can do the same thing.
[1:02:31] But if we say, "Lord, pick us up. Try us
[1:02:33] one more time. Forgive us." Amen. Amen.
[1:02:35] Remember this is it's not based on Moses
[1:02:38] couldn't take them either way because
[1:02:39] Moses represented the law and it was
[1:02:42] grace that took him into the promised
[1:02:43] land. Amen. But you
[1:02:47] see, he his temper. So, so the devil hit
[1:02:52] Moses and he fell. Yeah. The devil came
[1:02:57] against David and he numbered the
[1:03:00] people. He did all kinds of things. See
[1:03:02] in the scriptures that that Satan
[1:03:04] tempted David and he numbered the people
[1:03:06] and for whatever reason that was a
[1:03:07] terrible thing to do. And God told them,
[1:03:10] "Do you want to have pestilence come
[1:03:11] through or do you want to have war or
[1:03:13] what? You know what?" And he said,
[1:03:14] "Lord, I I just fall into your hands.
[1:03:16] There's a great plague went through and
[1:03:18] killed thousands of them. because he
[1:03:20] numbered the people. But the enemy came
[1:03:22] against him and he fell. He was still
[1:03:25] king though. You understand? But then
[1:03:27] now that same enemy came against Jesus.
[1:03:30] And what did he do? He just quoted the
[1:03:32] word back at him.
[1:03:34] Amen. He didn't fall.
[1:03:37] Amen. And he did that to show because
[1:03:39] this is what he does. Now, forgive me
[1:03:41] for the saying, but now I just trust his
[1:03:44] sticks. I don't want to be sacriiggious,
[1:03:46] but it's like monkey see monkey do.
[1:03:48] Okay, I'm not trying to say it as a
[1:03:51] joke. So what he does is says, "Look,
[1:03:52] this is me. This is how I live. I'm
[1:03:54] demonstrating my life." And he says,
[1:03:56] "Now you do it."
[1:03:59] You understand? I don't know how better
[1:04:01] way to say it. But you understand? He
[1:04:03] demonstrated this is how a man should
[1:04:04] be. This is how a believer should be.
[1:04:07] And then his life goes into you. And
[1:04:08] then you look at that and say, "This is
[1:04:10] what I can be. This is what I've been
[1:04:12] made to be."
[1:04:14] Amen.
[1:04:21] So maybe if we have some musicians to
[1:04:24] come but you
[1:04:26] understand we may be it doesn't matter
[1:04:29] how many remember it says in it says in
[1:04:31] the old
[1:04:33] testament he says though a man would
[1:04:37] fall well basically says it's not him
[1:04:40] that falls it's him that gets back up.
[1:04:42] Amen. That is the
[1:04:45] overcomer because we're not going back
[1:04:46] to slavery.
[1:04:48] Amen. If you give up, you know, we're
[1:04:53] not called to give up. Remember, we're
[1:04:55] not sons of dust anymore.
[1:04:57] Amen. We are sons and daughters of God.
[1:05:01] And Jesus demonstrated in in in
[1:05:04] flesh, I can overcome all things. Yeah.
[1:05:08] And then he put his same life in you to
[1:05:11] show now you can overcome all things
[1:05:14] through me.
[1:05:16] Amen. That's why Paul said, "I can do
[1:05:18] all things through Christ Jesus that
[1:05:19] strengthens me." Amen. And and he wasn't
[1:05:22] making some idol boast. He's saying
[1:05:24] actually I can do all things through
[1:05:25] him. Amen. Remember he's Jesus is the
[1:05:29] same yesterday, today, and forever. So
[1:05:31] if he can do all things through Christ,
[1:05:32] we sure can. Amen. Amen. So what
[1:05:36] whatever we're called to fight against,
[1:05:39] you can overcome it. Amen. It's like I
[1:05:43] said last Wednesday, Brother Brand
[1:05:45] preached a sermon, time- tested
[1:05:47] memorials.
[1:05:48] Yep. And he used people time-tested. So
[1:05:52] they've been walking with God for a long
[1:05:53] time and yet they're still walking with
[1:05:55] God. Amen. He doesn't want fly by
[1:05:58] nights. He wants people who are rugged,
[1:06:00] day in day out believer.
[1:06:02] Amen. That's a time-t tested memorial.
[1:06:05] And that's what he wants on this day.
[1:06:08] And that's what he's going to have.
[1:06:10] That's why it's a great victory. It's
[1:06:11] like brother Donnie Reagan said. He
[1:06:14] said, he said, you know, yo, you know,
[1:06:16] some people say, "Well, God is not doing
[1:06:18] a lot for me." Well, we've just lived
[1:06:21] another few days in Satan's Eden.
[1:06:24] Amen. That's a victory. Remember, Adam
[1:06:26] and Eve fell in Eden, but there's going
[1:06:28] to be a bride that will stand in Satan's
[1:06:30] Eden. Amen. Satan's been crafting this
[1:06:33] world for 6,000 odd years. This is the
[1:06:35] best he can do.
[1:06:37] And yet we're here and we say, "We don't
[1:06:38] want it." The shiny stuff doesn't
[1:06:41] appeal. I don't want your shiny stuff.
[1:06:44] Amen. Amen. That's what he's done. Look
[1:06:46] at this. Look at this. Look at this. Is
[1:06:48] all the best things. He's like a
[1:06:49] salesman. Come buy this. It's so
[1:06:51] wonderful. Look at everything it can do.
[1:06:53] And there's just not there's nothing in
[1:06:55] me to buy it. Amen. I trust it's the
[1:06:57] same in you. When you look at Satan's
[1:06:59] shiny things, his trinkets of things,
[1:07:01] you say, "Well, actually, I don't want
[1:07:03] those things." My nature's been changed.
[1:07:06] And that's why we can just live life, go
[1:07:09] to work, go into the world, come back
[1:07:12] home rejoicing. Amen. Amen. Just
[1:07:14] overcoming all things because Jesus
[1:07:16] overcame all things. Amen. And and he's
[1:07:19] in you and I. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:24] Amen. Let's just stand to our feet,
[1:07:25] shall we?
[1:07:31] Amen. Hallelujah. I feel like doing a
[1:07:35] dance or just doing a dance or
[1:07:38] something. I don't know. Amen. Let's um
[1:07:40] can we sing when uh uh we can go up and
[1:07:42] take the country. Amen. Possess the land
[1:07:44] from Jordan to the sea.
[1:07:46] Amen. We are able to go up and take the
[1:07:49] country. Hallelujah.
[1:07:56] Amen. You say, "Well, no. What I've said
[1:08:00] is not
[1:08:01] theory. It's not some nice idea. It's a
[1:08:04] reality." Amen. Amen. We have what?
[1:08:08] Remember, we have the goods. You don't
[1:08:10] need an upgrade. You don't need the next
[1:08:12] new model. This is the model. Amen. We
[1:08:16] have the goods. Amen. Let's just sing
[1:08:19] this.
[1:08:20] We are able to go up and take the
[1:08:25] country to possess the land from Jordan
[1:08:29] to the
[1:08:31] sea. Though the giants may be there,
[1:08:34] I'll wait to
[1:08:36] hinder. God will surely give the
[1:08:40] victory.

[1:08:53] name. Sons of

[1:09:43] him, God will surely give the
[1:09:48] victory. Sons of
[1:09:51] God, march
[1:09:54] forward. We are born in the Savior's
[1:09:58] way.
