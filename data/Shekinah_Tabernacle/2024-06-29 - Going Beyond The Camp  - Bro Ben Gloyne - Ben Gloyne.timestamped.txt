[23:29] [Applause]
[23:34] God bless you
[23:36] SS so my testimony uh
[23:40] today this is a thing that started in
[23:44] 2021 so I had been having Gynecology
[23:47] problems uh which they call
[23:50] postmenopausal bleeding so this had been
[23:53] happening for many years but each time
[23:56] when they checked everything was was
[23:59] okay so this year in March it was like a
[24:04] followup appointment so I went to see
[24:08] the
[24:09] gynecologist and he
[24:11] said things have changed all the
[24:15] symptoms that I had the differential
[24:19] diagnosis was endometrial cancer was one
[24:23] of them and they needed to rule it out
[24:27] so they did um an
[24:31] ultrasound and they they they also did
[24:34] blood
[24:35] tests and the gynecologist noticed that
[24:39] there was a polyp and a polyp was not
[24:43] there before so a poly is an abnormal
[24:46] tissue growth in the uterus so he said
[24:50] because of that we need to do a surgery
[24:52] to remove it a
[24:55] hysteroscopy and also the lining of of
[24:58] the uterus was abnormally thick so all
[25:02] those symptoms were pointing out that
[25:04] this should be in the motal
[25:07] cancer so while we were doing that I I
[25:11] spoke to to my pastor I told brother Ben
[25:14] and Sister Christine and I came here uh
[25:17] and I was prayed for and I was anointed
[25:19] with
[25:20] oil and in the meantime we just waiting
[25:23] for the dead because they said it's
[25:24] going to be like in four weeks time and
[25:27] all my family they were praying about
[25:29] it so my daughter who is in Australia
[25:33] called me and she
[25:35] said uh something mysterious happened
[25:38] here in in Melbourne there is a preacher
[25:41] that came uh from Zimbabwe and he was
[25:44] invited to their church so the anointing
[25:47] was so great and he was like testifying
[25:50] and saying lots of things and then all
[25:52] of a sudden he said your mother in New
[25:56] Zealand is healed and then my daughter
[25:58] was was like wondering what what is he
[26:01] saying and he said again your mother in
[26:04] New Zealand is healed then my daughter
[26:07] my daughter stood up and she said I went
[26:10] to shake his hand and he said again that
[26:14] your mother in New Zealand is healed but
[26:17] the preacher we don't know him my
[26:20] daughter uh didn't know him as well so I
[26:25] said okay can I get his number and I got
[26:30] his number and then we spoke and then I
[26:33] didn't tell him that my daughter had
[26:35] told me about what he said about me I
[26:38] just said um can you just pray for me
[26:41] this is what the doctors are
[26:44] saying and he said sister uh they're not
[26:48] going to find the the pop and they're
[26:50] not going to find any cancer at all
[26:52] let's pray and he prayed for
[26:56] me then uh uh when the day of the
[26:59] surgery was on the uh 17th of April then
[27:03] we went there and they kept asking me if
[27:06] I need um any tissue if I need to take
[27:10] when they remove it if I wanted uh to
[27:13] take it with me then I said no I don't
[27:15] want to take any tissue with me I just
[27:17] want you to take a photo and um anyway I
[27:23] went with my family to to Christ
[27:26] hospital and then then they did the the
[27:30] surgery and after I was in the recovery
[27:34] room for a very long time because uh the
[27:37] blood pressure kept going up all the
[27:39] people were coming and going but I was
[27:41] still there and then all of a sudden it
[27:44] just went back to normal and then I was
[27:47] I went back to the to my room and then
[27:50] uh when the nurse was now coming back
[27:52] then I asked for the for the photo of
[27:55] the of the polyp and then she said you
[27:59] know what they didn't find the
[28:02] pop then I just saw a God who answers
[28:07] prayers a God who knows me a man who
[28:10] doesn't even know
[28:11] me just saw it in the spirit that
[28:14] there's a sister in New Zealand who
[28:16] needs prayer and said I am healed so um
[28:22] we went home and then the gynecologist
[28:26] prayed that he had told me that but
[28:28] after 6 days he was going to um because
[28:32] he was going to they took a biopsy
[28:34] because they they needed to to really
[28:36] check that there wasn't any endometrial
[28:38] cancer so after 6 days he said he was
[28:41] going to call me and then I had to tell
[28:44] my patients in the clinic that I I'm
[28:46] waiting for a very important call if
[28:49] someone calls I need to go out and get
[28:51] this call so he called me while I was at
[28:55] work and he was like very happy and um
[28:58] and asking about my family and
[29:00] everything and I was just thinking ah it
[29:03] can't be cancer otherwise he's happy and
[29:06] then he said you know what um everything
[29:10] is
[29:12] normal but all the symptoms that I
[29:17] had they all like were abnormal and the
[29:21] only thing that they suspected was
[29:23] endometrial cancer so I just want to
[29:27] encourage enourage everyone that God is
[29:30] there and he's
[29:31] alive and he knows
[29:34] you thank you so much for
[29:37] [Applause]

[43:16] to 14 then we're going to go to numbers
[43:19] uh chapter
[43:23] 32 so it says here the Apostle Paul
[43:26] speaking here we have an altar whereof
[43:28] we have no right to eat which serve the
[43:31] Tabernacle for the bodies of those
[43:32] beasts whose blood is brought into the
[43:35] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[43:36] burned without the camp wherefore Jesus
[43:39] also that he might sanctify the people
[43:41] with his own blood suffered without the
[43:43] gate let us go forth therefore unto him
[43:46] without the camp bearing his reproach
[43:49] for here we have no continuing City but
[43:51] we seek one to come amen so want we need
[43:55] to go beyond the camp there's a lot of
[43:57] camps to go beyond we're going to go
[43:58] beyond them all amen and and the biggest
[44:01] one to go beyond is
[44:02] s amen and so we're just going to and
[44:05] then also for a bit of a context we're
[44:06] going to read here from numbers 321 to
[44:09] to
[44:10] 12 to me this is astounding we're going
[44:14] to go into it but to me this is very
[44:16] astounding numbers 321 to2 it says
[44:19] surely none of the men that came out of
[44:22] out of Egypt from 20 years old and
[44:24] upward shall see the land which I swear
[44:26] unto Abra unto Isaac unto Jacob because
[44:29] they have not wholly followed me save
[44:32] Caleb the son of Jeffy the K kenite and
[44:35] Joshua the son of nun for they have
[44:37] wholly followed the Lord I trust this
[44:41] all make sense as we go along amen but

[46:51] amen amen amen God bless you friends you
[46:53] can you can all have your seats this
[46:55] morning so I want to I want to speak
[46:57] about going beyond the camp or going
[47:00] going Beyond where we are right now now
[47:02] to me this well there's a lot of camps
[47:05] to go beyond but but I just want to just
[47:07] focus here on this scripture here
[47:08] numbers 32 to me this is amazing where
[47:11] where many people just see a negative of
[47:13] this while the ones who are 20 years and
[47:15] older because they murmured and didn't
[47:17] believe the promise of God that God
[47:19] would take them uh into the promised
[47:21] land that they would not see that land
[47:23] you know and sure there's that side of
[47:24] it but to me it's astounding that the
[47:26] generation under that we're going to go
[47:28] beyond their parents unbelief they're
[47:30] going to go beyond am mean the culture
[47:32] they raised up and they're going to go
[47:33] beyond amen the the the unbelief that
[47:36] was permeating the camp and they were
[47:38] going to have faith in the promise of
[47:39] God they weren't going to live according
[47:41] to their parents and according to what
[47:43] they did they were going to live
[47:44] according to the word and to me that's
[47:46] astounding that a that that a generation
[47:48] of young people a generation could
[47:50] actually be raised up in a house of
[47:51] unbelief but not become that unbelief
[47:54] ien but they could take God at his word
[47:55] and say no Mom and dad you've gone as
[47:57] far as you've gone that's up to you but
[47:59] I'm going further than you I mean I'm
[48:01] not staying in the desert with you and
[48:02] you're complaining I'm going to believe
[48:04] God like Caleb and Joshua I'm going to
[48:06] go beyond what what what you're doing
[48:08] mom and dad and I'm going to walk with
[48:10] my God that I'm going to receive every
[48:12] promise that he's given me amen and to
[48:14] me this is really going beyond the camp
[48:16] amen because because we must go beyond
[48:19] the camp of ourselves that's really
[48:22] where I want to get down to today and
[48:24] our and our natural upbringing we have
[48:26] to go beyond the camp of our temperament
[48:30] and our you know our lineage and all
[48:32] these things we must go beyond those
[48:33] things we cannot let our first birth
[48:35] Define us amen if your if your family
[48:39] line has a line that you just can't
[48:41] forgive you got to go beyond that amen
[48:43] if there's an adulterous spirit in your
[48:44] family line you got to go beyond that I
[48:46] mean if there's a lying spirit in your
[48:48] family line you got to go beyond that
[48:50] amen whatever disappointment whatever
[48:52] thing has happened to your family and
[48:53] your forbears that don't Define you amen
[48:56] the blood of Jesus Christ is meant to
[48:58] Define you amen who you are and the word
[49:00] of God is called to Define you amen our
[49:03] cultures are not we must go beyond the
[49:05] camp of our culture amen I say the Kiwi
[49:08] culture is not a Christian culture it's
[49:11] an antichrist
[49:13] culture she'll be right no worries mate
[49:16] all that kind of stuff no that doesn't
[49:19] take the kingdom of God I mean that is
[49:21] not a no no we don't have a shield be
[49:24] right kind of culture i I must go beyond
[49:27] that Ian I got to live beyond that and
[49:29] it's easy I can hey I can call out any
[49:31] culture in this room but I'm going to
[49:32] call out mine it's safer cuz people
[49:35] don't get offended if you get offended
[49:36] if you say your culture is wrong you
[49:38] need to be B born again you need to go
[49:40] beyond that culture we're not any
[49:41] nationality under under the heaven no we
[49:44] are the culture of heaven so I'm not
[49:46] defined I got to go beyond the shiby
[49:48] right kind of mentality amen I got to go
[49:50] beyond the you know the number eight
[49:52] fencing wire independent you know
[49:54] irreverent kind of culture casual and
[49:56] relaxed and no I got to go beyond that
[49:58] Hallelujah that's not me it was me but
[50:01] it's not me now it was who I am but it's
[50:03] not who I am anymore cuz that guy died
[50:05] and there's a big sticker on him do not
[50:07] resuscitate do not Harvest his organs
[50:10] don't take any part of them none of
[50:11] them's good amen none of them's usable
[50:14] amen leave them dead amen hallelujah so
[50:17] we have to go beyond our culture we have
[50:18] to go beyond our upbringing we must go
[50:21] beyond the camp of of of of our early
[50:24] years of our life and we can't let that
[50:26] Define anymore we must go beyond the
[50:29] camp of that amen we must go beyond the
[50:31] camp amen of our of our human weaknesses
[50:36] we must go beyond the camp of those
[50:37] things we have no excuse not to serve
[50:40] God in this day we don't have any excuse
[50:43] you know Legion Legion had more excuses
[50:45] than a lot of us here it didn't stop him
[50:47] going beyond the camp he went to the
[50:49] Lord Jesus beyond the camp of the tombs
[50:51] and what he was used to he went beyond
[50:53] that camp amen we need to go beyond the
[50:55] camp of the spirit of of entertainment
[50:58] amen see people want the gospel to
[51:00] entertain them the gospel is not
[51:02] entertainment church is not here to

[51:41] and flashy no we just need the presence
[51:43] of God I mean that's what we really need

[51:48] of this I I say this generation's very
[51:51] weak and I include myself in this

[56:10] a Tuesday it should I me it should live
[56:12] on a Wednesday it should live on a
[56:14] Thursday and a Friday and a Saturday and
[56:17] we're back in Sunday again I mean why
[56:19] because this is Everlasting gospel I
[56:21] actually got this I was listening to
[56:23] brother um Armand on Wednesday you know
[56:25] he talked about Moses in the burning
[56:27] bush and there was a bush that went
[56:29] beyond the camp of Natural Things it
[56:31] kept burning and it kept burning it
[56:34] wasn't consumed and Moses said this is a
[56:36] strange sight I've seen a lot of bushes
[56:38] burn but normally they get burnt up this
[56:40] bush was still burning and I was
[56:41] thinking you know Moses became that
[56:43] burning bush amen he got set a flame on
[56:46] fire and he walked down to Egypt and he
[56:48] was a burning bush down in Egypt there's
[56:50] a burning bush by the Red Sea there's a
[56:53] burning bush in the wilderness burning
[56:55] with what the glory of God he is burning
[56:57] up but it didn't consume him it was just
[56:59] burning up amen and that's to me this is
[57:01] what we should become and are I trust if
[57:04] you know him I mean you you you've gone
[57:06] beyond the camp of human ability you've
[57:09] gone beyond the camp of natural just
[57:10] just joining church and having a
[57:12] religion why you're still
[57:14] burning Hallelujah Lord amen you see the
[57:19] the spirit of entertainment is is
[57:21] actually a a a Christ rejecting Spirit
[57:24] Herod wanted to be entertained
[57:27] he needed to go beyond the camp of that
[57:29] cuz her brought oh Jesus is here do a
[57:31] miracle I want to see something neat
[57:33] entertain me Lord he needed to go beyond
[57:36] the camp of that now I'm excited well
[57:40] I'm excited you know I'm sure you all
[57:42] know Me Now by enough you know
[57:45] Hallelujah we have a living God he wants
[57:48] us to go beyond the camp of our
[57:50] upbringing I'm going to probably repeat
[57:52] these things a lot because a lot of
[57:53] people it's like this but you've got to
[57:55] go beyond it am you say but this is how
[57:57] I am no a new birth is not a patch up
[58:01] job it's not a Reformation it's not a
[58:03] seven steps to overcoming and and a
[58:06] little little little crisis thing and a
[58:08] little Band-Aid no you become a new
[58:11] creation you become a new creation and
[58:13] it's the only way that will break
[58:15] generational curses is you become a new
[58:18] creation amen that your family may be
[58:20] this way your great grandparents what it
[58:22] could be great Granddad grumpy pants and
[58:24] now you got that same kind of Gene going
[58:26] on but a new birth breaks that I mean
[58:29] we've got to we've got to realize the
[58:31] Holy Ghost is more than enough I mean
[58:33] the blood of Jesus Christ is more than
[58:35] enough it's not just a little bit and
[58:38] yes it's okay it's not just some dosage
[58:40] and no it's an overcoming power amen
[58:43] it's an overcoming consuming fire amen
[58:45] that God comes down and burns out that
[58:47] sin nature changes your nature that
[58:49] you're a different personall and you
[58:51] can't help it because you've been
[58:53] changed amen hallelujah but you see we
[58:56] need to go beyond the camp amen
[58:59] hallelujah Gideon was stuck in a camp it
[59:02] wasn't a camp of Victory he's a he's a
[59:05] circumcised believer living in the
[59:07] promised land but it wasn't a camp of
[59:10] Victory and then so when the angel of
[59:12] the Lord came and spoke to him he just
[59:13] asked the question if God before us then
[59:16] where are the Miracles where's the life
[59:18] that we read about in the Torah where's
[59:20] that life that we read that spoke to
[59:22] Abraham and the one that spoke to Moses
[59:24] and the one that spoke to Joshua and you
[59:25] know sure I can go to where where where
[59:28] where Jericho was I can see where God
[59:30] was but where is he today good question
[59:32] but he was trapped in a camp amen and he
[59:35] so what he what he had to do is we know
[59:37] the angel of the Lord came down and he
[59:39] said he said to he said to Gideon you're
[59:42] a mighty man of Valor I'm going to break
[59:44] you out of this Camp I'm going to break
[59:46] you out of what you think you are and
[59:48] I'm going to show you what you really
[59:49] are I'm going to break you out of this
[59:50] Camp of your family and your lineage and
[59:53] because we know the word you know the he
[59:54] was of the tribe Manasseh and Manassa
[59:57] means to forget so he was living in the
[1:00:00] camp of forgetfulness all right cuz
[1:00:02] there he is threshing weed and secret
[1:00:04] living in his inheritance stress that
[1:00:07] the enemy is going to come and take away
[1:00:08] his Harvest he's just trying to survive
[1:00:10] and well you don't know the economic
[1:00:12] conditions and you don't know what my
[1:00:13] family suffered and you don't know what
[1:00:15] happened to me and poor me and I'm all
[1:00:17] this and that the angel said no you are
[1:00:19] not what you think you are you're a
[1:00:21] mighty man of Valor and you're going to
[1:00:23] Manifest this I'm going to break you out
[1:00:25] of the cycle I'm going to break you out
[1:00:27] of this camp that you think you're so
[1:00:28] living and I'm going to show you what
[1:00:30] you really
[1:00:31] are but you see straight after this he
[1:00:34] was instructed to destroy the altar of
[1:00:37] destroy the idol of and altar of Baal in
[1:00:39] his father's house yeah he saying Giddy
[1:00:42] and the reason this problem is here is
[1:00:43] because your father's erected this thing
[1:00:46] and this has been holding you back now
[1:00:48] I'm not saying fathers here have got
[1:00:49] alts of bail in their lives but I want
[1:00:52] he had to break something that was an
[1:00:53] established thing in his family routine
[1:00:56] he had to go beyond what was accepted in
[1:00:59] his family see there's always a voice
[1:01:01] that tries to pull you back there's
[1:01:03] always a voice you know actually the
[1:01:05] title for this it probably doesn't make
[1:01:06] much sense but I was driving to church
[1:01:08] yesterday and you know and and and and
[1:01:11] and it we're going to silence the voice
[1:01:13] in the room behind you that probably
[1:01:15] doesn't make much sense but it's going
[1:01:17] to I trust it will as we go to the
[1:01:18] Tabernacle and so on but there's always
[1:01:20] a voice behind you you've got to silence
[1:01:23] and listen to God's still Small Voice
[1:01:25] that's strong drawing you into his
[1:01:27] presence amen so Gideon had to Gideon
[1:01:30] had to throw down this altar that his
[1:01:32] father had and cut down the Grove and
[1:01:33] had to destroy that thing so if if his
[1:01:37] if his father was Moody High Strung High
[1:01:39] tempered aent I mean revent to religion
[1:01:42] all those things that became a thing
[1:01:44] that was worshiped and that controlled
[1:01:47] the family maybe he wasn't loving maybe
[1:01:50] he wasn't kind maybe there's just
[1:01:52] something in him that you know it became
[1:01:54] something that he actually gave service
[1:01:56] too that had to be destroyed amen that
[1:02:00] was holding Gideon back it was holding
[1:02:01] Israel back it was holding the family
[1:02:03] back they had to go ahead so the angel
[1:02:06] took him and said destroy this thing
[1:02:08] because I'm taking you beyond the camp
[1:02:10] and then we know the next morning you
[1:02:12] know the people of the city got up and
[1:02:13] said hey Gideon's destroyed this altar
[1:02:15] we should put him to death and and
[1:02:17] Gideon's own father said let Baal fight
[1:02:19] for himself if he's really God if this
[1:02:22] thing is so important he'll fight for
[1:02:24] itself of course baale can't fight he
[1:02:27] just a dead
[1:02:28] Idol you see but the thing is the angel
[1:02:31] had to tell Gideon you've got to destroy
[1:02:34] this thing that defines your family you
[1:02:35] got to go beyond amen and we need to go
[1:02:38] beyond ourselves we need to go beyond
[1:02:41] our upbringing we need to go beyond a
[1:02:43] message culture we're going to go beyond
[1:02:46] well I dress right I talk right I listen
[1:02:48] to the message all those things are good
[1:02:51] I pray read the Bible but we're going to
[1:02:53] go beyond just a just a function of that
[1:02:55] culture culture amen because we need to
[1:02:57] go beyond that to the Living God that
[1:02:59] lives that takes the quotes and makes it
[1:03:01] live takes the word and makes it live am
[1:03:04] mean that that we don't just talk about
[1:03:05] what God did in brother brandom's day or
[1:03:07] maybe years ago in this church but no
[1:03:09] He's Alive here am mean that the fires
[1:03:13] of Revival are burning on every heart
[1:03:15] amen that the reality because we're got
[1:03:17] to realize if God if God has purchased
[1:03:19] our Salvation which he has if God has
[1:03:22] redeemed Us by his blood which he has if
[1:03:24] God has opened every to us when he took
[1:03:26] the book which he has am mean if he said
[1:03:28] look all of this is yours which it is
[1:03:31] then we should we need to go beyond the
[1:03:32] camp of what we're used to and lay hold
[1:03:35] of that thing you see the way we go
[1:03:38] beyond the camp As we judge God Faithful
[1:03:40] he's able to do it amen Caleb went
[1:03:43] beyond the camp of the unbelief let's
[1:03:46] just go back to that he went beyond him
[1:03:48] and him and Joshua went beyond the camp
[1:03:51] of the unbelief of the other 10 spies by
[1:03:55] judging God God Faithful is able to do
[1:03:57] it amen see the other 10 spies in their
[1:04:00] unbelief they were in a camp of human
[1:04:03] ability we can't take the land they're
[1:04:06] too strong their walls are too big all
[1:04:08] those things they're in a camp of human
[1:04:10] ability and this is the worst Camp to be
[1:04:12] in it's the most deceptive Camp to be in
[1:04:15] and we'll come to it with the with the
[1:04:17] inner court and the Tabernacle but it's
[1:04:19] the most deceptive thing where people
[1:04:20] rely on their own ability to do the job
[1:04:25] but Caleb and Joshua weren't in that
[1:04:27] camp because they judged God faithful in
[1:04:31] spite of what was in the land God gave
[1:04:33] them the land then that caused them to
[1:04:35] go beyond the camp of what everyone else
[1:04:37] was living in that's how they got in so
[1:04:41] it's not complicated it's actually a
[1:04:43] very simple thing when Faith really
[1:04:45] drops in the heart and you really judge
[1:04:47] God faithful and you really believe his
[1:04:49] promises that he's more than able to do
[1:04:51] it for you you'll go beyond the camp
[1:04:53] amen amen you won't stand your condition
[1:04:56] amen but you will go beyond to where God
[1:04:58] wants you to be praise the Lord amen
[1:05:03] amen praise the Lord you see we have to
[1:05:06] go beyond the camp of
[1:05:09] tradition I say it's easy oh you say
[1:05:12] well we're in the message we can't this
[1:05:14] will never turn into a family tradition
[1:05:16] it
[1:05:17] will it will I know the quotes I know
[1:05:20] where it happened I know the timeline I
[1:05:22] know this I know this I know that it can
[1:05:25] become a tradition well we go to church
[1:05:27] CU what my family does and we pray cuz
[1:05:29] my family does I read the Bible cuz my
[1:05:31] family does no it's got to you got to go
[1:05:32] beyond the camp of that
[1:05:34] tradition amen you got to go beyond the
[1:05:36] camp that it's real to you I read it
[1:05:39] because it's the word of God and it
[1:05:41] feeds my soul I come to church to
[1:05:42] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:05:44] hear the word and let God come down and
[1:05:46] you know I pray to God to have communion
[1:05:47] with him because he's living on the
[1:05:49] inside of me and I want to be one with
[1:05:50] him and and I hear the word because it's
[1:05:52] got quickening power and and I want to
[1:05:53] be closer to God that's how it should be
[1:05:55] be amen and it's not about if it's
[1:05:58] boring or not you know who no it's not
[1:06:00] about that it's not to entertain
[1:06:02] you amen amen who cares about being
[1:06:05] entertained I'm not here to be
[1:06:07] entertained I'm not entertaining I hope
[1:06:09] I'm
[1:06:10] not right so but the devil's conditioned
[1:06:14] us to say well does it excite you enough
[1:06:16] and if it excites you enough then
[1:06:18] therefore it must be good that's how the
[1:06:20] world works is it not you don't see
[1:06:23] people like I mean you take the beetles
[1:06:25] for example there was a 60th year
[1:06:27] anniversary they here in Wellington you
[1:06:29] look at how they played that those
[1:06:31] concerts and that was less flashy than
[1:06:34] just some some high school band that is
[1:06:38] today if we went back to that concert
[1:06:41] you if we were transported back there
[1:06:42] well one would say it's horrible cuz
[1:06:44] there's nothing in us that loves it but
[1:06:45] just say we're of the world okay we went
[1:06:47] back to the Beatles Concert we'd say
[1:06:49] this is dumb where's the lights where's
[1:06:52] the where's the choreograph dancing
[1:06:54] these guys are on these nerdy suits in
[1:06:56] their D yo this is
[1:06:57] lame compared to today but it was
[1:07:00] entertaining in that day and
[1:07:02] entertainment's just got
[1:07:04] greater right and we can't let the
[1:07:06] gospel become the same way we're not
[1:07:09] here to be entertained but we can't let
[1:07:11] this thing become a family tradition
[1:07:12] it's got to be a real sincere thank you
[1:07:15] Lord you saved me amen I come in
[1:07:18] sincerity Lord because I know it wasn't
[1:07:20] me that found you you found me I know
[1:07:22] you called me you called my parents and
[1:07:24] you're calling me and Here I Am Lord I
[1:07:27] just want to give my life to you and I'm
[1:07:28] so appreciate the fact you found me I so
[1:07:31] appreciate the fact you died on Calvary
[1:07:33] for me I so appreciate the fact you
[1:07:35] opened the book of redemption to me amen
[1:07:37] this it's got to be a a a great
[1:07:39] sincerity amen now I'm not saying we're
[1:07:41] not sincere but never let this become a
[1:07:43] family tradition well it's Sunday
[1:07:45] morning while I go to church well it's
[1:07:47] Wednesday while I go to church it's this
[1:07:48] I do this youth service while I do this
[1:07:50] it's got to go beyond that Amen to Lord
[1:07:53] I can come in contact with you
[1:07:56] I want to come and worship you I want to
[1:07:57] gather as a people and worship you that
[1:07:59] your spirit can come down and you can do
[1:08:02] amen incredible things in our midst and
[1:08:03] you can change my life Lord because Lord
[1:08:06] I want to be a Christian every moment of
[1:08:08] every day amen where where I can see the
[1:08:12] character in my life when I read the
[1:08:14] Bible I can see that character already
[1:08:16] living out of me amen someone hits me I
[1:08:18] turn the other cheek amen someone demand
[1:08:21] something of me I give them greater amen
[1:08:24] I don't hold ought I'm I'm I'm quick to
[1:08:26] forgive slow to anger it's it's not my
[1:08:28] human temperament I'm born with living
[1:08:32] anymore who wants that I think I I think
[1:08:34] it's a great
[1:08:36] deal amen that's what we need right amen
[1:08:39] so so it should be an utmost sincerity
[1:08:41] Lord You Have Changed Me amen but that's
[1:08:44] only we can only get that when we go
[1:08:46] beyond the camp of a family tradition
[1:08:49] amen well my grandfather was this you as
[1:08:51] I said I think last Sunday my my
[1:08:53] children are fourth generation believer
[1:08:56] they're going to go beyond the camp of
[1:08:58] that that's not going to get them to
[1:08:59] Heaven sorry folks it's not going to
[1:09:02] help you we we all must know the Lord
[1:09:04] ourselves we must go beyond the camp of
[1:09:07] our upbringing to so we meet a true and
[1:09:09] living God Amen Hallelujah you see it's
[1:09:12] a family tradition we don't identify
[1:09:14] ourselves with our sacrifice that we are
[1:09:17] dead with our sacrifice oh we're
[1:09:18] Christians because I went and join the
[1:09:19] church joining a church is fine but
[1:09:21] until you're identified till you lay
[1:09:23] your hands upon him and you and become
[1:09:25] one until the spirit of Christ becomes
[1:09:27] in you and you in Christ then you'll
[1:09:29] become a son and daughter of God it
[1:09:31] don't seem to be sincerity that we ought
[1:09:33] to have it becomes a ritual just the
[1:09:35] same it as is now it's a ritual for
[1:09:37] people to become a Christian amen but
[1:09:39] when you really lay your hands upon them
[1:09:41] in faith amen the life that's in our
[1:09:43] lamb our lord Jesus comes into you and
[1:09:46] changes you that it's no longer you
[1:09:48] living but he that he that lives in you
[1:09:50] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah see
[1:09:53] we've got to go beyond the camp of
[1:09:54] what's
[1:09:57] accepted David when David became king he
[1:10:01] in uh instituted the worship and the
[1:10:04] singing the things he put in place for
[1:10:05] the for the temple to be built he never
[1:10:08] worshiped in high places he never did it
[1:10:12] but then when Solomon came into into
[1:10:14] into uh kingship you can read through
[1:10:17] first and second Kings there becomes a
[1:10:20] cycle of of the people sacrificing in
[1:10:23] the high places so there came something
[1:10:26] that it was once not accepted now it's
[1:10:28] accepted now became accepted practice
[1:10:31] now this became a camp of in instead of
[1:10:35] worshiping the place where God placed
[1:10:37] his name amen but they would Worship in
[1:10:39] the high places and this would continue
[1:10:42] on for 300 odd years until Hezekiah came
[1:10:44] I just want to read this here you can go
[1:10:46] through first and second Kings I don't I
[1:10:48] don't have all the kings here but you
[1:10:49] know we know there's many there's many
[1:10:52] good Kings and there's many evil Kings
[1:10:55] and nine times out of 10 it would say
[1:10:57] that you know there'd be there' be the
[1:10:59] Kings and they would they would list
[1:11:00] their name and they would list their
[1:11:01] mother and all these things um whether
[1:11:04] she was good or bad but but you see
[1:11:06] here's Asha I mean ASA sorry did that
[1:11:09] which was right in the eyes of the Lord
[1:11:10] as did David his father and he took away
[1:11:13] the sodomites out of the land and
[1:11:14] removed all the idols that his father
[1:11:16] had made and also uh Mah how however you
[1:11:20] say her name is Mother even her he
[1:11:22] removed from being Queen because she had
[1:11:24] made an idol and a drove and ASA
[1:11:26] destroyed her Idol and burnt it by the
[1:11:29] Brook Kidron so he's gone beyond the
[1:11:31] camp of what his mother was doing amen
[1:11:34] but the high places were not removed
[1:11:36] nevertheless asa's heart was not perfect
[1:11:38] with the Lord all um was perfect so with
[1:11:42] the Lord all his days and we just keep
[1:11:43] going down and Jehoshaphat the son of
[1:11:46] Assa began to Reign Over Judah in the
[1:11:48] fourth year of Ahab king of Israel
[1:11:50] Jehoshaphat was 3 and5 years old when he
[1:11:53] began to Reign and he reigned 20 5 years
[1:11:56] in Jerusalem his mother's name was uh
[1:11:59] azubah the daughter of um Shi and um he
[1:12:03] walked in all the ways of asa's father
[1:12:05] he turned not aside from it doing that
[1:12:07] which was right in the eyes of the Lord
[1:12:09] nevertheless the high places was not
[1:12:11] were were not taken away for the people
[1:12:13] offered and burnt incense yet in the
[1:12:15] high places now this keeps going on okay
[1:12:18] so once was accepted I mean once was not
[1:12:22] accepted now becomes accepted someone's
[1:12:24] got to go beyond the camp yeah am of
[1:12:27] these things see it can become accepted
[1:12:29] that people live with their unbelief and
[1:12:32] their
[1:12:32] carnality it become it can become an
[1:12:35] accepted thing where people are just
[1:12:37] well I'm just dealing with my humanity
[1:12:39] and well I'm stuck with it we're going
[1:12:41] to go beyond the camp of that you got to
[1:12:43] go beyond the camp of living by emotion
[1:12:46] amen we're we're called to go beyond
[1:12:47] that camp amen amen hallelujah now and
[1:12:52] we got in the seventh year of J uh jeho
[1:12:55] jehoash began to Reign and 40 years
[1:12:58] reigned he in Jerusalem and his mother's
[1:13:00] name was Zaba of BBA and jehoash did
[1:13:04] that which was right in the sight of the
[1:13:06] Lord all those days when uh jodia the
[1:13:09] priest instructed him but the high
[1:13:11] places were not taken away the people
[1:13:13] still sacrificed and burned incense in
[1:13:15] the high places now we're going to come
[1:13:18] to an end to all these things cuz
[1:13:19] there's going to be someone that will go
[1:13:21] beyond the camp there's someone that
[1:13:23] will go beyond the camp back back to the
[1:13:25] original worship amen there'll be
[1:13:27] someone because God always breaks a
[1:13:29] cycle he'll anoint someone to break the
[1:13:32] cycle amen and I trust you say in your
[1:13:35] heart Lord let that be me amen there's a
[1:13:37] lot of scriptures in the Bible I don't
[1:13:39] want to put my hand up
[1:13:41] for amen I don't want to be H
[1:13:44] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:13:46] lovers of God truth Breakers false
[1:13:48] accusers despise of those that are good
[1:13:50] having a form of godliness but despising
[1:13:52] you know the power thereof and all those
[1:13:54] things I don't want to fill that right I
[1:13:57] don't want to be a fool like the Bible
[1:13:59] says I'm not putting my hand up to
[1:14:00] fulfill that right you know I I think I
[1:14:04] read it last Sunday where where um you
[1:14:06] know Absalon was was raised up in
[1:14:09] David's house amen because because you
[1:14:12] know we know David took bash shebra and
[1:14:13] then Nathan the prophet went in and said
[1:14:15] the sword will never leave your house
[1:14:16] David because of this sin if I heard
[1:14:19] that I'll say I'm not going to cause any
[1:14:21] trouble anymore in this
[1:14:23] place he amen that's what I would have
[1:14:26] done I ain't causing no trouble in
[1:14:28] David's house someone else can fulfill
[1:14:30] that scripture I ain't fulfilling that
[1:14:33] scripture right wouldn't you do that
[1:14:36] wouldn't you be oh oh who I wonder who's
[1:14:37] going to be and it ends up to be you no
[1:14:39] I'm not going to be that guy amen so
[1:14:42] there's some scriptures I'm I ain't
[1:14:44] fulfilling amen amen I said Lord I don't
[1:14:47] want anything to do with that Lord I
[1:14:48] just want to be what you want to believe
[1:14:49] it to be Lord I want to go beyond the
[1:14:52] camp I want to fulfill what you would
[1:14:53] have me to fulfill amen
[1:14:55] someone's going to break the cycle now
[1:14:57] it came to pass in the third year of
[1:14:59] Hosea king of I mean son of elah king of
[1:15:01] Israel that Hezekiah the son of aaz King
[1:15:04] of Judah began to Reign Hallelujah 25
[1:15:08] years old was he when he began to Reign
[1:15:10] and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem his
[1:15:13] mother's name also was ABI the son I
[1:15:15] mean sorry the daughter of Zachariah and
[1:15:17] he did that which was right in the sight
[1:15:19] of the Lord according to all that his
[1:15:22] father did amen all that his father did
[1:15:25] this is one who's gone beyond the camp
[1:15:27] gone back to the original worship amen
[1:15:29] he removed the high places and break the
[1:15:32] images and cut down the Groves and break
[1:15:34] in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses
[1:15:37] had made for unto those days for unto
[1:15:39] those days the children of Israel did
[1:15:41] burn incense to it and he called it
[1:15:45] Neu uh that
[1:15:48] name they called a they made a gift of
[1:15:51] God into an
[1:15:52] idol that thing had to be cut down
[1:15:55] that thing had to be destroyed because
[1:15:57] the people were worshiping Divine
[1:15:59] Healing instead of the one who gave the
[1:16:01] Divine Healing amen so and he trusted in
[1:16:04] the Lord God of Israel so that after he
[1:16:07] was none like him among all the kings of
[1:16:09] Judah this man went beyond the camp of
[1:16:12] his lineage and went beyond the camp of
[1:16:14] his four Bears hallelujah amen nor was
[1:16:17] there any before him for he clav to the
[1:16:20] Lord and departed not from following him
[1:16:22] but he kept his Commandments which the
[1:16:24] Lord command commanded Moses what a guy
[1:16:28] he went beyond the camp I know I'm
[1:16:30] repeating myself but I just want to
[1:16:32] emphasize this where are you today amen
[1:16:34] where are you today are you are you
[1:16:36] serving God because of your natural
[1:16:39] temperament by emotion your father may
[1:16:42] be a certain way and you're a spitting
[1:16:44] image we shouldn't be like that amen
[1:16:47] sure there's good every every natural
[1:16:49] lineage has good characteristics
[1:16:52] right but all the bad's got to be burnt
[1:16:55] out all the bad's got to be burnt out
[1:16:57] something's been haunting your family
[1:16:59] for centuries that thing's got to come
[1:17:00] to an end someone's going to let God
[1:17:03] break the cycle someone's got to let God
[1:17:05] take them beyond the camp of that thing
[1:17:08] and I say Lord it might as well be me
[1:17:10] amen sure the rest of my family can come
[1:17:12] too but I'm not I'm not staying behind
[1:17:14] Lord Lord I want I want you to come and
[1:17:17] break the cycle of those things out of
[1:17:19] my life you see family strains are very
[1:17:22] powerful I'm just going to read this
[1:17:23] this is from the message paradox
[1:17:25] bit of a lengthy reading but so this is
[1:17:27] brother bryand having an interview with
[1:17:29] a father and a mother about their son
[1:17:31] who who did something to his girlfriend
[1:17:33] wouldn't apologize all these things but
[1:17:35] yet he's a Believer yet he's been
[1:17:36] baptized yet he's among the saints and
[1:17:39] they don't understand why did he react
[1:17:41] this way well it's because he hasn't
[1:17:43] gone beyond the camp of his first birth
[1:17:45] yet this this young fellow's parents his
[1:17:48] mother's German no reflection on the
[1:17:50] German but there is a strain in that
[1:17:52] family that is they'll just sit and you
[1:17:54] can talk to them and they'll just stare
[1:17:55] you right in the face this girl's sister
[1:17:58] the mother of the boy her sister you can
[1:18:00] come down the street many morning and
[1:18:02] this young lady would be sitting out in
[1:18:03] the yard I'd say good morning to you
[1:18:04] she'd just look at me and I'd stop and
[1:18:06] I'd say sure fine morning she'd just
[1:18:08] stand look right at you an intelligent
[1:18:10] woman I'd say come up and see us
[1:18:12] sometimes she'd just stand there and
[1:18:14] look while brother her brothers are that
[1:18:16] way father and mother is that way now
[1:18:18] the father of the boy is strictly an
[1:18:20] Irishman Moody high-tempered High Strung
[1:18:23] that's his whole family like that except
[1:18:27] one out one other out of the family
[1:18:30] converted see this this the thing has
[1:18:32] father and mother both are Christians
[1:18:34] filled with the Holy Ghost and they have
[1:18:36] brought this young man up in the way of
[1:18:38] the Lord now the young man is about 171
[1:18:40] 18 years old something along there very
[1:18:42] fine kid and he's been a real model boy
[1:18:45] at home nice kid he's got a brother
[1:18:47] that's just vice versa but the girls the
[1:18:49] mother's family lives close to a fine
[1:18:51] church do you think they'd ever come
[1:18:53] over there and no they know it's right
[1:18:55] but it's just not in them to ask
[1:18:57] forgiveness or ask pardoning they need
[1:18:59] to go beyond the camp of that I mean if
[1:19:01] it's not in you to ask forgiveness or
[1:19:03] ask pardoning but you're not right go
[1:19:05] beyond the campu of that your tempered
[1:19:09] mury High go beyond the camp of that am
[1:19:12] mean they just won't do it it's just not
[1:19:13] in them now the genes in the father and
[1:19:15] the mother of this boy no matter how
[1:19:17] much they are converted still remain in
[1:19:19] the flesh that's been interbred out to
[1:19:22] this boy therefore the boy has got a
[1:19:23] complex in him just like from this
[1:19:26] Mother's family and they're not
[1:19:28] forgiving they will not apologize that's
[1:19:30] where the boy stands you say it's not
[1:19:32] feir you say but it's not fair this boy
[1:19:35] is born with a complex you say no that's
[1:19:37] not fair but the Lord has provided a
[1:19:41] remedy for that complex before he was
[1:19:44] ever born am me before he ever came into
[1:19:46] the mind of his father or mother before
[1:19:48] his mother even knew that he was in uh
[1:19:50] that that he was in her womb the Lord
[1:19:52] had made a way that that complex will be
[1:19:55] dealt with so it's no longer not fair
[1:19:59] it's actually he is unfair on himself by
[1:20:02] not going beyond the camp of that
[1:20:03] complex and getting Liberty from it
[1:20:06] because the blood of Jesus
[1:20:07] Christ delivers every complex amen every
[1:20:11] every family strain can come subject to
[1:20:16] the blood of Jesus Christ if you're
[1:20:18] willing to go beyond the camp of
[1:20:21] it I said no matter how much you've
[1:20:24] raised him up
[1:20:25] now look at you out of your family all
[1:20:26] of them drunks and fighting shooting
[1:20:28] cutting so forth now look at your family
[1:20:30] to the mother there are a bunch of
[1:20:31] people that just sit W speak very
[1:20:33] independent so forth irreverent to
[1:20:35] religion but I said it's not you you're
[1:20:38] the only one out of all your brothers
[1:20:39] and sisters you are sweet kind and
[1:20:42] forgiving see God makes you vice versa
[1:20:45] people are unforgiving some people can
[1:20:47] be very stoic some people can be very
[1:20:49] you know not emotional they'll just sit
[1:20:51] there like a like a lump on a post you
[1:20:53] know that's their first birth but then
[1:20:56] when God gets a hold of them they're
[1:20:57] loving they're warm they're open they're
[1:21:00] kind they're emotional amen they praise
[1:21:02] God hallelujah amen amen why sweet and
[1:21:06] kind what does that you're a tree part
[1:21:08] of the family tree yet you have received
[1:21:10] the Holy Ghost that's the thing made you
[1:21:12] tender and sweet it's not your people
[1:21:14] anymore it's your Christ that lives in
[1:21:16] you amen I said to the boy look at your
[1:21:18] family practically all them are drunks
[1:21:20] and so forth I said and how Moody High
[1:21:22] tempered High Strung but you're not
[1:21:25] you're kind forgiving what is it the
[1:21:26] Holy Spirit you're no more what you are
[1:21:30] it's Christ in you I said now the same
[1:21:32] thing has to happen to your son am so he
[1:21:34] has to go beyond the C his upbringing
[1:21:36] was good his parents are filled with the
[1:21:39] Holy Ghost what a perfect home to be
[1:21:40] raised in be had to go beyond the camp
[1:21:43] of his upbringing to meet the Lord
[1:21:45] himself amen amen
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] hallelujah so God is here to break the
[1:21:53] iniquity
[1:21:55] that is visited down from the you know
[1:21:57] on the third and fourth
[1:21:59] generation the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:22:02] more than able to break generational
[1:22:05] problems there's nothing too hard for
[1:22:07] the Lord amen see because as I said
[1:22:10] before if any man be in Christ he is a
[1:22:12] new creature or a new creation old
[1:22:15] things have passed away behold All
[1:22:17] Things become new Hallelujah we become a
[1:22:20] brand new creation that were no longer
[1:22:22] identified by where we came from
[1:22:24] naturally but we identify by where we
[1:22:26] came from amen our true origin our Lord
[1:22:29] Jesus amen amen hallelujah but you see
[1:22:32] now as I said we got to go beyond the
[1:22:34] camp of the of of many things and the
[1:22:37] thing is it's because there are two
[1:22:40] phases to Christianity brother Bram
[1:22:42] teaches and and it's represented here
[1:22:44] this is the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:22:46] as Moses was uh uh he saw a pattern in
[1:22:49] heaven and he built it upon the Earth
[1:22:52] and we know that this Tabernacle
[1:22:54] represents presents the human body right
[1:22:57] so not in this picture but there's the
[1:22:58] outer Court where there's the Brazen
[1:23:00] altar there's a place of sacrifice
[1:23:02] that's like the body and then you come
[1:23:04] into the inner Court where the where
[1:23:05] there's the manora here there's a shoe
[1:23:07] bread there's the altar of incense
[1:23:09] that's like your spirit and then here
[1:23:11] where there's the um where there's the
[1:23:13] Covenant Arc of the Covenant and
[1:23:15] different things that's like the soul
[1:23:17] but this also represents the Christian
[1:23:19] Journey now as Believers we're not
[1:23:22] called just to come in and stand by the
[1:23:24] altar of
[1:23:25] sacrifice remember Calvary is not our
[1:23:28] destination Calvary is the beginning
[1:23:31] that is the beginning of the Christian
[1:23:32] walk many many churches today they
[1:23:34] preach just get to the cross and you've
[1:23:36] made it and one way yes and one way no
[1:23:39] because your journey starts at Calvary
[1:23:41] amen right it ends at a new body amen so
[1:23:45] it starts at the cross it doesn't end at
[1:23:47] the cross so so it's a great thing to
[1:23:49] come to the Cross that's a glorious
[1:23:51] thing but you can't just stay there just
[1:23:53] to be justified by by faith it's a
[1:23:55] glorious it's it's a glorious experience
[1:23:58] when you're justified by faith who said
[1:23:59] that when you realize the Lord Jesus has
[1:24:02] died for you on Calvary his blood has
[1:24:04] been shed for you his blood atones for
[1:24:06] you amen and you and he's given you
[1:24:09] Faith to believe it's more than a story
[1:24:11] it's a reality that's a glorious thing
[1:24:13] amen but you can't just stay there I
[1:24:16] mean cuz someone can stand there and
[1:24:17] they've still got this unconverted
[1:24:19] nature amen they can still stand there
[1:24:21] and just have this unbelieving heart
[1:24:22] still they're not fully converted even
[1:24:25] Jesus would say to Peter when thou art
[1:24:27] converted strengthen the Brethren and
[1:24:29] there he was he had been sent out to
[1:24:31] preach the gospel heal the sick raise
[1:24:33] the Dead cast out Devils but yet he
[1:24:35] wasn't even converted
[1:24:38] yet
[1:24:39] wow amen so it's so it's a good thing to
[1:24:43] do that but then you got to go from
[1:24:45] there from outside into into the inner
[1:24:47] court now now this is this is this room
[1:24:50] as I said um quite a bit earlier where
[1:24:53] where it's human human ability is what
[1:24:55] rules because if you look at this now
[1:24:58] here is the here is the here is the
[1:25:00] light the light in this room is is from
[1:25:03] the manora here that manora had to be
[1:25:05] fed oil by a priest it was not the light
[1:25:09] of God lighting that room it was human
[1:25:11] made light amen and that light had to be
[1:25:15] it was the human ability of the priest
[1:25:17] that kept the kept those seven golden
[1:25:20] candlesticks of flame it wasn't God that
[1:25:23] did it amen it was it was was the priest
[1:25:24] that had to light it and and there was
[1:25:27] the shoe bread here which is the bread
[1:25:29] of God's presence here priest had to
[1:25:32] bake that bread it wasn't manner in a
[1:25:34] pot that never got old never went empty
[1:25:37] it it was humanly made amen the altar of
[1:25:40] incense that was a priest had to come
[1:25:42] and offer that incense upon the Altar
[1:25:44] and we know that that is a that is an
[1:25:46] altar of prayer amen so all these things
[1:25:49] are are human ability so someone who's
[1:25:52] always always always magnifying their
[1:25:55] own Christian walk is still in that room
[1:25:58] am mean someone who is comparing their
[1:26:01] Christian walk with others is still in
[1:26:03] that room but yet in that room you see
[1:26:05] the seven Church ages you can see
[1:26:07] everything God has done from Calvary to
[1:26:08] now you can see the whole Plan of
[1:26:10] Redemption but it's still up in here
[1:26:12] it's human ability to absorb it now
[1:26:15] should we study yes absorb the message
[1:26:17] listen to it meditate on it read the
[1:26:19] word do all those things but it's not
[1:26:21] our human but if it's only our human
[1:26:23] ability
[1:26:25] then what happens is the light can get
[1:26:27] SMY the light can get Smokey in there it
[1:26:30] can even go out cuz it's human ability
[1:26:33] now brother Ram scissors says the next
[1:26:34] man comes into the first Court there are
[1:26:36] the seven golden candlesticks that was
[1:26:38] good light but many times the
[1:26:40] candlesticks went out the lamp smoked up
[1:26:43] he lived by an artificial light some
[1:26:45] days he was up other days he was
[1:26:48] down
[1:26:49] now the person who lives in the holy of
[1:26:52] holies has good days and bad
[1:26:54] days but there's a life of God within
[1:26:57] them amen that they can't quit they're
[1:27:01] not living by the flesh they're not
[1:27:03] living by how they feel they're not song
[1:27:05] letting because everyone sees them
[1:27:07] they're not just worshiping God you know
[1:27:09] doing a special and they're on the peer
[1:27:11] like a lump on a log no they're
[1:27:13] worshiping God wherever they are amen
[1:27:15] they're not doing it for a show they're
[1:27:17] doing it out of sincere worship but they
[1:27:19] can have the worst week they've ever had
[1:27:21] but yet they're praising God anyway and
[1:27:23] they're not drawing attention to
[1:27:24] themselves they're worshiping God so you
[1:27:26] see we're not immune I just want to get
[1:27:28] this out of your mind you can have bad
[1:27:29] days and living the holy of holies but
[1:27:30] you're living by a different life and a
[1:27:32] light amen let's just go back to that
[1:27:34] now some days he was up other days he
[1:27:36] was down that's the way with the
[1:27:38] Christian experience you're only living
[1:27:39] in a Justified State going to church and
[1:27:41] saying well I did the best I can no you
[1:27:45] got to come to a place where Jesus did
[1:27:46] the best he could and I've been saved by
[1:27:49] the blood I've been Sanctified filled
[1:27:50] with his holy spirit amen on the King's
[1:27:53] Highway to day amen where where you're
[1:27:55] going to have rainy days you're going to
[1:27:56] have days you wonder whether you're
[1:27:58] you're a Christian or not you're going
[1:27:59] to have days when you're going to wonder
[1:28:01] whether the Miracles are right or not
[1:28:03] there's going to be days whether you

[1:28:10] your mind if you walk into a little
[1:28:12] fellowship with the church again with

[1:28:15] candlesticks where the offering was only
[1:28:18] made and the sacrifice burned you'll

[1:28:39] artificial
[1:28:41] light that's how you know where you're
[1:28:43] living that if someone else's walk
[1:28:47] pushes you out of your own walk you're
[1:28:49] still in the you're still in the wrong
[1:28:52] place right because the lamp gets Smoky

[1:29:08] want to stay there see we going to go
[1:29:09] beyond the camp amen we to go beyond the
[1:29:12] camp see it's very I'd say it's easy to
[1:29:14] live in in in
[1:29:16] here right but it takes a real death to
[1:29:19] go to here it takes a real death to see
[1:29:22] there's voices that say stay in here
[1:29:25] it's acceptable to stay in here stay as
[1:29:27] a church member stay as a good Christian
[1:29:29] stay as something that's just acceptable
[1:29:32] but no voice of the world or no
[1:29:33] religious voice will encourage you go to
[1:29:35] the presence of God go there into the
[1:29:37] holy of holies right so you've got to
[1:29:39] you got to hear God's see God's still
[1:29:42] small voice says come into me come into
[1:29:45] my presence let me come and live in you
[1:29:48] amen there's no longer you keeping the
[1:29:50] light going you see in here was man's
[1:29:52] ability

[1:30:10] central focus of the whole place Amen in
[1:30:14] here you could see the blood was on The
[1:30:16] Mercy Seat Amen in here there's no mercy
[1:30:19] seat amen so someone who's in here is
[1:30:22] judgmental someone in here is
[1:30:24] understanding someone here looks down on
[1:30:25] other people some people here are
[1:30:27] judgmentally oh that person deserved
[1:30:29] that that person is not doing what I'm
[1:30:31] doing you see the person in here became
[1:30:34] the central Focus remember remember in
[1:30:37] the temple Zachariah went into this room
[1:30:39] but in the temple right everyone was on
[1:30:41] the outside and they're saying I wonder
[1:30:43] why Zachariah hasn't come out yet he was
[1:30:46] the focus of what was going on in the
[1:30:48] room and people who are just a message
[1:30:50] religious person they can be in this
[1:30:52] room and they become the focus there's
[1:30:54] no mercy in this room but the mercy seat
[1:30:57] is in here amen and when you go through
[1:31:00] the veil with a true death to you'll see
[1:31:02] the blood on the mercy seat and then
[1:31:05] you've received true mercy and then you
[1:31:07] want to give Mercy am mean you're not
[1:31:09] condescending you're not down on other
[1:31:11] people you're not condemning nobody you
[1:31:13] say Lord your heart is Lord Lord pull
[1:31:15] them into your holy of holies Lord may
[1:31:17] they see your true Mercy amen hallelujah
[1:31:20] this is see so the mercy seats there you
[1:31:22] see the blood is on the Mercy see the
[1:31:24] glory of God is lighting the room
[1:31:27] nothing can go Smokey cuz God don't go
[1:31:30] Smoky no experience on the outside and
[1:31:33] what other people are doing smoke up
[1:31:35] that room cuz God don't do a he doesn't
[1:31:39] burn
[1:31:40] poorly amen he burns well amen so
[1:31:43] there's the there's the glory of God and
[1:31:45] there the mercy seats there amen there's
[1:31:47] the Sho um there's the there's the
[1:31:49] there's the pot of Mana where the word
[1:31:52] doesn't get old it doesn't get boring it
[1:31:55] doesn't get stale it's sweet every
[1:31:57] mouthful is sweet every mouthful is
[1:31:59] glorious to your soul am mean every
[1:32:02] mouthful is alive it's light hall
[1:32:04] hallelujah it's wonderful amen and in
[1:32:07] there is the is is the lawn two tablets
[1:32:10] of stone but they're under the Blood On
[1:32:12] The Mercy Seat amen so the word is
[1:32:15] written in the heart Hallelujah so it's
[1:32:17] not a learned behavior many P see in
[1:32:19] here it becomes a learned behavior what
[1:32:22] must I do when I come into this room
[1:32:24] what must I do to do this and people
[1:32:26] love that kind of thing if they don't
[1:32:28] have a real
[1:32:29] relationship see and it looks fortical
[1:32:32] to be in here because it's so contrary
[1:32:34] to being in here see someone in here
[1:32:37] isn't judgmental like in here and some
[1:32:40] many people think well I'm Discerning
[1:32:42] therefore I'm you know that's not
[1:32:44] judgmental I'm Discerning no a critical
[1:32:46] spirit is not
[1:32:48] discernment because true discernment
[1:32:50] gives a way out true discernment gives
[1:32:52] you a love and a burden for that
[1:32:54] personall that's what true discernment
[1:32:56] does Amen a critical spirit just wants
[1:32:58] to
[1:33:00] criticize we don't need that stuff it
[1:33:03] doesn't it doesn't help you it doesn't
[1:33:05] help that person amen hallelujah praise
[1:33:09] God so in here is the pot of Mana the
[1:33:11] word is wonderful and fresh and sweet
[1:33:14] Amen in there is Aaron's Rod Hallelujah
[1:33:17] in there as Aaron's right it was
[1:33:19] fashioned by Aaron to be fashion to be
[1:33:21] used by a man but when it came into the
[1:33:23] pres of God had buttered armonds
[1:33:26] overnight Hallelujah the life that was
[1:33:28] contained within it could come out amen
[1:33:30] and when you come in here amen that
[1:33:32] predestinated c Gene of God comes forth
[1:33:35] into life amen it's no longer a learned
[1:33:38] behavior it's no longer you trying to be
[1:33:39] a Christian no he's the Christian in you
[1:33:42] amen he takes this word and manifests it
[1:33:45] out of your life and you can't help it
[1:33:47] it's going to keep living Hallelujah so
[1:33:50] that's a big that's why you've got to
[1:33:52] silence the voices of here yeah if no
[1:33:54] one else is going in here I'm going in
[1:33:57] if no other family is going to the
[1:33:59] prince of God I'm going to take my
[1:34:00] family in am I want to go beyond the
[1:34:03] camp of tradition go beyond the camp of

[1:34:07] and say Lord I want you I want reality I
[1:34:11] want to see you burn and live like you

[1:34:14] we've seen that let's not turn it into
[1:34:17] into a
[1:34:18] tradition let's not take it for granted
[1:34:21] that God moved in the past say Lord I
[1:34:23] want more more of you Lord I want more
[1:34:25] of that I want to go beyond the camp of
[1:34:27] just having a testimony of yesterday but
[1:34:29] I say Lord I want to draw from that
[1:34:31] testimony strength that you are the same
[1:34:33] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[1:34:37] hallu

[1:34:42] as an experience that'll take them under
[1:34:43] the shikina glory where all the curtains
[1:34:46] will fall and hide the man from the
[1:34:47] things of the world till you live in the
[1:34:49] presence of God under his great power
[1:34:51] under the interlocking wings of the Holy
[1:34:53] Ghost and the cross and in the cross
[1:34:55] you'll stand and the cross don't become
[1:34:57] a burden anymore it's not a burden to be
[1:35:00] a Christian anymore no it picks up wings
[1:35:03] and flies away hallelujah it's light
