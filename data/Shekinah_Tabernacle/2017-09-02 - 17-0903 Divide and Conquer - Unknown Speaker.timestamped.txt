[48:15] this is Nehemiah they're rebuilding the
[48:18] walls of Jerusalem but it came to pass
[48:20] that when sanballat heard that we
[48:23] builded the wall he was wroth and took
[48:25] great indignation and mocked the Jews
[48:27] and he spake before his brethren and the
[48:29] army of Samaria and said what do these
[48:31] feeble Jews will they fortify themselves
[48:33] will they sacrifice will they make an
[48:36] end in a day will they revive the stones
[48:38] out of the heaps of the rubbish which
[48:40] are burnt and the answered all those is
[48:42] yes
[48:42] now tobiah the ammonite was by him and
[48:46] he said even that which they build of a
[48:48] fox go up he shall break this stone wall
[48:51] here o our God for we are despised and

[48:58] them for a prey in the land of captivity

[50:12] and conquer and I'm going to show you
[50:14] that as he has divided and he's
[50:18] conquered nations and peoples then he
[50:21] comes right down into the family and he
[50:23] divides and conquers the family the same
[50:25] way so this is where I'm going to go but
[50:28] in the same but in the same token we are
[50:31] living in a season just like Jeremiah
[50:33] and the Jews were in that in that season
[50:36] where where they had been called out of
[50:39] Babylon they have come back into the
[50:41] promised land and now they have to
[50:42] rebuild they have to rebuild the city
[50:45] and it's just like us we were you know
[50:48] if you if you're going to church history
[50:50] you see the churches birth to Pentecost
[50:52] and then and then the Creed's of man
[50:54] were mixed in as they went along and a
[50:56] Council of Nicaea and then the and then
[50:59] the church world went into darkness into
[51:01] the dark ages and it went into Babylon a
[51:04] winter confusion but then they came
[51:06] alike you're a Reformation started and
[51:09] and the call begin to come coming out my
[51:13] people come out of her my people and
[51:16] then so we've heard that call in mistake
[51:19] come out of her my people beam up I take
[51:21] ever since so we've we've been called
[51:23] out of Babylon out of confusion our
[51:25] mystery babylon we're being called and
[51:27] we've come into our inheritance into the
[51:29] Holy Ghost now we have to build now we
[51:31] have to rebuild that which were that
[51:33] which they had in the beginning this is
[51:35] where I'm going you think well where are
[51:36] you going with this this is what I'm
[51:37] going that's the that's a sermon in a
[51:39] bottle as brother our man would say and
[51:41] I want to read this this is from a
[51:45] blushing prophet in 1956 brother Burns
[51:48] made a older call and people are people
[51:51] are coming and it says to see these
[51:53] young women coming weeping life before
[51:56] them throughout the crossroads they are
[51:58] victims of circumstances what he says do
[52:02] you realize old men when we were boys
[52:04] our boys has ten times the temptation we
[52:08] had sisters you realize that our
[52:10] daughters has ten times the temptation
[52:12] you had when you was a girl well what
[52:15] will her daughter have look at the
[52:16] things the picture pictures that devil
[52:19] is painting oh how we need to pray now
[52:22] we'll go back to you again brother do
[52:24] you realize you don't pray as half as
[52:26] much as our fathers did pastor do you
[52:28] know we don't put as much time in our
[52:30] knees as the pastor's before us that
[52:31] woman do you realize we don't instruct
[52:34] our daughters and pray with her at night
[52:35] like our mothers did you then what about
[52:38] it who's guilty we are guilty there's no
[52:40] way around it we're guilty
[52:41] he says I'm guilty I'm guilty of not
[52:43] doing the job of God like I should do
[52:46] now we say well that's pretty heavy
[52:48] but he's saying these are these young
[52:51] women that have come to the altar the
[52:52] Prophet saying they have victims of
[52:55] circumstance well what is the
[52:57] circumstance the circumstances that the
[53:00] family has become divided that the
[53:03] parents are not doing the job they
[53:05] should be doing now there is a
[53:06] responsibility of the children as well
[53:08] who's a child here who's living at home
[53:11] and is dependent on parents now the
[53:14] scripture tells you Amen this is for
[53:18] sister Robin now put her handle
[53:23] but the scripture says for children to
[53:26] obey the appearance and if you look at
[53:29] and I don't know if we'll get that far
[53:30] maybe we're next week but you read in
[53:32] Romans chapter 1 and you read in 2nd
[53:35] Timothy
[53:35] where all the description of all the
[53:37] sins and then there is disobedient
[53:39] appearance its fornication adultery
[53:41] coveted nurse whatever more idolatry and
[53:44] then disobeyed the parents is in there
[53:45] and God is not ranking them he's saying
[53:48] that is in the same bracket as things so
[53:51] a child a child responsibility even
[53:54] before they come to an age of
[53:55] accountability is to obey the appearance
[53:57] but then it says in the same token that
[53:59] fathers do not provoke your children to
[54:01] anger at least they'd be discouraged
[54:03] right so there is a way to do it but the
[54:07] children's responsibility to please God
[54:09] is to actually obey your parents and all
[54:12] the parents should say amen now there
[54:16] when real quiet on low what's happened
[54:18] so finally you've come in to bat for us
[54:20] for once
[54:22] now so there are victims these so what I
[54:27] just read there they are victims of the
[54:29] circumstance that the family unit has
[54:33] been divided they are they that is what
[54:37] they are victims of right because we
[54:40] have to understand now we know the world
[54:43] is evil we know it's the most what he
[54:47] called the most deceptive ages ever be
[54:49] and we know it's the darkest ages ever
[54:52] been but the power of God in this age is
[54:56] greater remember the the anointing that
[54:58] is present is always greater than the
[55:01] powers of the enemies always in every
[55:03] age so we can't we don't need to worry
[55:06] about oh it's so dark and we're living
[55:08] in Sodom and Gomorrah and the world is
[55:10] falling apart
[55:10] sure it is but but the anointing on the
[55:13] office of mom and dad I mean the
[55:16] anointing of the Living God will keep
[55:18] the children and will keep the family
[55:20] strong many admire they weren't your
[55:23] they they got distracted and what the
[55:26] Kings decree was and what the enemy was
[55:29] saying and they got discouraged and
[55:31] things but Nehemiah stayed focused we
[55:33] must build we're going to rebuild this
[55:36] it shall rise this prophecy that the
[55:39] house will be rebuilt hallelujah and the
[55:42] biggest now he say well had you stopped
[55:45] at that my children are victims of
[55:46] circumstance like like these ones it's
[55:49] very simple if the husband and wife
[55:51] relationship is solid in every way not
[55:55] just sharing a bedroom or sharing a
[55:57] house but you're connected body spirit
[56:01] and soul you're one if that is strong in
[56:05] the family unit is strong amen okay if
[56:12] that is strong then that will defeat
[56:14] everything but if there's a division now
[56:18] let's just go to know I'm gonna lower
[56:22] back round then Oh didn't someone remind
[56:24] me later first Corinthians eleven just
[56:27] see how good your memory is cuz we're
[56:28] going to go there there's a layer and a
[56:30] family there's layers of protection in
[56:32] the family and if those layers you say
[56:35] well my husband's not here or whatever
[56:37] more there's still a protection there
[56:39] for you for the family these layers of
[56:42] defense that God has placed in and it's
[56:44] when people stand in their office I mean
[56:47] they say I've been made it because
[56:49] remember it's not just prophets that are
[56:51] called or ministers or musicians or
[56:54] whatever more it's a calling to be a
[56:56] parent you're being ordained you got to
[56:59] understand if you have children if you
[57:02] have children got it before the
[57:03] foundation of world ordained you're
[57:05] gonna stand as a father you're gonna
[57:07] stand as a mother
[57:08] holy your standard a husband your
[57:10] standard as a wife it's a god-given
[57:12] office and God has called you to be in
[57:15] that office and there's power in that
[57:17] office hallelujah you've gotta um you
[57:20] gotta remember that you see cuz what is
[57:23] what is okay I don't want to jump ahead
[57:26] of myself now many times we criticize
[57:28] how young children act sisters dress
[57:31] brothers act but we are looking at the
[57:34] wrong thing
[57:35] they have victims of the circumstance of
[57:37] other influences coming in because
[57:40] parents are not in their position now
[57:42] you cannot stop the world being the
[57:44] world you know you can't just push a
[57:47] button and you know we can't just go
[57:49] find some mouth and
[57:50] top and build a monastery and live there
[57:53] I'd get a bit claustrophobic yeah we
[57:55] could but hey you know but but the world
[57:58] is still there right so you can't stop
[58:00] that happening but it's the influence of
[58:02] the godly mum and dad that influence
[58:05] always has to be greater in the world
[58:08] okay now Ecco I'm just gonna read a bit
[58:15] so it influences in 1964 now my subjects
[58:19] tinnitus influences you want to read
[58:22] this story turn to see in chronicles 26
[58:24] chapter that's use I was a shepherd boy
[58:27] he was anointed king at the age of
[58:29] sixteen he was a godly man this man was
[58:31] a was a good man he had godly parents he
[58:34] did that which was right on the side of
[58:35] the Lord now we find that usually how
[58:39] he's identifying a problem and when the
[58:41] Prophet was standing here you just go I
[58:42] remember doing social stage at school
[58:44] and we learned about the 50s and the 60s
[58:47] and just as school had just showed after
[58:49] World War Two in the 50s and the 60s
[58:52] Society just changed completely and but
[58:56] the devil has been allowed to do it he's
[59:00] been allowed to do it you take you take
[59:02] it was in the paper a few years ago
[59:05] it was the anniversary of when the
[59:06] Beatles went to Australia when they did
[59:09] and it changed the whole social fabric
[59:11] of that country one one band touring
[59:14] around released an anointing into that
[59:16] country and it changed the face of it
[59:18] and it's just that's in the papers was
[59:21] documented there one visit and so now so
[59:26] there's all those things but the
[59:29] prophetsí is now we find I think today
[59:32] our gate a great problem of what we
[59:34] believed to be juvenile do delinquency
[59:36] is a parent delinquent a home delinquent
[59:39] our people got away from the things that
[59:42] they should have stayed with the church
[59:45] now notice what he's saying the church
[59:47] got lukewarm or cold and the children
[59:49] got out into the world so he's not
[59:52] saying the church got liberal and he's
[59:55] got lukewarm and cold he identifies that
[59:58] and when the Prophet speaks he's saying
[1:00:00] he's saying things very specifically
[1:00:02] even they say he's just throwing
[1:00:04] things he's not the right because he's
[1:00:05] putting an order this is this is what's
[1:00:07] happened as the church gets cold and
[1:00:09] lukewarm and then then the children get
[1:00:12] out into the world because the power and
[1:00:14] the church I mean should impact now I
[1:00:18] only have them maybe a Wednesday maybe a
[1:00:21] Sunday you've got them the rest of the
[1:00:23] week but when we come together see I
[1:00:26] want my children be raised in such an
[1:00:27] atmosphere they know what it's like to
[1:00:30] see God move they know us like the Feliz
[1:00:32] presents I mean I feel as anointing come
[1:00:35] down and see people be transformed Alou
[1:00:38] you I want them to know what that's like
[1:00:40] but it's not just in these four walls
[1:00:42] what happens that should happen at home
[1:00:44] hallelujah just just just the way we
[1:00:46] live the atmosphere we carry with us
[1:00:48] it should unpack them they should know
[1:00:51] the difference even if they can't maybe
[1:00:52] identify you know but they should
[1:00:55] something in the mud say this is God I
[1:00:57] don't know what this is out in the world
[1:01:00] they should they they should be you know
[1:01:02] and printed of them so strongly they
[1:01:05] should you know what it's like to be in
[1:01:07] an atmosphere which is terrible who
[1:01:09] knows what it's like we're not all you
[1:01:11] know but who knows what it's like to be
[1:01:12] in his presence they meant so oh I
[1:01:17] believe our children deserve that kind
[1:01:19] of being raised in that way now
[1:01:23] Nehemiah the reason he is successful as
[1:01:27] you read so Ezra was written before
[1:01:29] Nehemiah even though their
[1:01:30] contemporaries they they rebuilt the
[1:01:32] temple then they rebuilt the city so the
[1:01:36] word the place of worship was rebuilt
[1:01:39] first it's just like us God gets us and
[1:01:42] we're a bunch of rubble
[1:01:44] I mean we're lost and undone we were
[1:01:46] chaos and then God calls us and he and
[1:01:50] he transforms and our soul first and
[1:01:53] then he fixes the rest of us I mean
[1:01:56] that's God's patna toys from the inside
[1:01:58] out because it's from the outside and
[1:02:00] it's just a it's just a veneer until it
[1:02:04] hits the inside but it should be the
[1:02:05] inside first right and so now so they
[1:02:10] made the word pre have preeminence we
[1:02:13] must rebuild this temple first that was
[1:02:16] the burden
[1:02:17] they had enemies around them they had
[1:02:19] opposition they said we must rebuild
[1:02:22] this and they rebuilt it
[1:02:24] then they rebuilt the city and it's the
[1:02:26] same thing with you now and you'll see
[1:02:28] it in the Kings like user or here's a
[1:02:31] car you know they repaired as always you
[1:02:34] know you go look at the godly Kings they
[1:02:35] repair the holes in the temple they
[1:02:38] repay the temple first normally and then
[1:02:41] they fix the breaches in the in the city
[1:02:43] walls or whatever it is but that is
[1:02:45] their paramount that's what they want to
[1:02:48] do first we must repair the temple are
[1:02:51] you with me it's a pattern
[1:02:53] go go go look in the scripture and then
[1:02:56] they rebuild in they're successful and
[1:02:58] God looks after them because we are
[1:03:01] living in the Amaya's day you have to
[1:03:03] understand that you you look in the Old
[1:03:06] Testament and things that the believers
[1:03:08] went through back there is replaying
[1:03:10] itself today I could have gone to his a
[1:03:13] Kai's life and it's exactly the same
[1:03:16] thing here he is is a godly King he
[1:03:18] wants to place God take it take the
[1:03:20] idols out of the land you know rebuild
[1:03:23] the temple but then the Assyrians are
[1:03:25] coming and swallowing up everything
[1:03:26] around them that's exactly what's
[1:03:28] happening in this day that history
[1:03:33] repeats itself now Hollywood now I see
[1:03:38] says the church got lukewarm or cold and
[1:03:40] the children got out into the world now
[1:03:44] Hollywood puts out lots of movies and
[1:03:46] television so forth that's even unseen
[1:03:48] sit with a curse and use God's name in
[1:03:50] vain and he used to be it was wrong for
[1:03:52] children and the holiness churches to go
[1:03:54] to bio scopes or picture shows now Satan
[1:03:57] has got one jump ahead of it by bringing
[1:03:59] it right into the house in the form of
[1:04:01] television and in uncensored and so
[1:04:03] forth and that's Satan's way of
[1:04:05] gradually entering in now that the
[1:04:10] television is not the problem it's what
[1:04:13] goes through it is the problem just like
[1:04:15] you're just like your phone or your iPad
[1:04:17] or your computer it's nothing wrong with
[1:04:19] the device it's what is on the device
[1:04:22] okay now he sees on the same sermon
[1:04:28] he says that's right that's the one I'm
[1:04:30] just jumping down a bit now it ain't how
[1:04:34] close you can come it's how well uh and
[1:04:38] how well you think your fortify it say
[1:04:40] just as far away from sin as you can
[1:04:42] stay right just get as far away as you
[1:04:45] can
[1:04:46] I can do this there's no harm in doing
[1:04:47] this well if there's a question in your
[1:04:49] mind don't do it at all anything there's
[1:04:52] a question stay away from it then you
[1:04:54] see then you're absolutely living by
[1:04:55] faith if there's no question if there's
[1:04:57] a question then leave it don't go around
[1:04:59] it at all and I think that many times
[1:05:01] that it's the parents that get away he's
[1:05:05] talking about influences I know I use
[1:05:08] these quite a few months ago but I
[1:05:09] wanted to bring it out again I know that
[1:05:11] sometimes the schools and things that
[1:05:12] Sunday schools about half an hour an
[1:05:14] hour on Sunday morning and the world has
[1:05:16] the kids the rest of the weekend crammed
[1:05:18] into there more than than a teacher and
[1:05:20] sometimes many time and many times too
[1:05:22] many times
[1:05:23] the teachers got a little quarterly that
[1:05:25] she teaches about while she paints her
[1:05:27] lips fixes are here and it's children do
[1:05:29] the best they can and then they get home
[1:05:31] and they get no Christian training at
[1:05:33] all mother's out somewhere to a card
[1:05:35] party no this is a this is a family
[1:05:37] divided mother's out somewhere to a card
[1:05:40] party dad's down at the bowling alley
[1:05:42] and sisters out with somebody with a hot
[1:05:44] rod and here you are see where did we
[1:05:48] where did we go
[1:05:49] it's a divided family I know this is not
[1:05:54] a shouting rejoicing service but here we
[1:05:56] are this is a divided family but God in
[1:05:59] this this age the anointing of the Lord
[1:06:01] is to restore family s to bring the
[1:06:03] family as one unit we're walking
[1:06:06] together now I'll show you the anointing
[1:06:09] on the world power is to divide and
[1:06:12] conquer this is in contrast the
[1:06:14] anointing upon the believers in the
[1:06:16] state which is for God to completely
[1:06:18] rebuild as people as family units and as
[1:06:21] a bride body around the world into the
[1:06:23] image of the word this is this is the
[1:06:26] anointing the word this message has come
[1:06:28] to rebuild homes to rebuild family
[1:06:32] relationship husband wife relationship
[1:06:34] amen now
[1:06:38] we have been called just like you know
[1:06:44] we have been taken like the Jews in
[1:06:46] their near modern Israel day who every
[1:06:49] Church mix all day returns mix Island
[1:06:51] Babylon to rebuild Jerusalem and live in
[1:06:53] the promised land again they were taken
[1:06:55] out of there they were taken from Israel
[1:06:57] and sent into captivity in the beginning
[1:07:00] because they mixed their worship with
[1:07:01] idol worship and that's why God took
[1:07:03] them from the land as he promised they
[1:07:05] he would do but now history and so that
[1:07:09] is repeated where the church fell at
[1:07:12] Nicaea where church and state was united
[1:07:15] and Christianity was mixed with pagan
[1:07:17] religion and so and the church went into
[1:07:20] the dark ages but then there was the
[1:07:22] Reformation and in our full restoration
[1:07:24] and the same time Allu you you take like
[1:07:29] you know we can go back to the time of
[1:07:31] Gideon why is Gideon by himself
[1:07:34] threshing wheat where's his family
[1:07:37] where's his father helping you know why
[1:07:40] is he alone by himself trying to get
[1:07:42] some wheat it's because the enemy had
[1:07:44] coming because the people worshipping
[1:07:46] idols and had divided the family and
[1:07:49] what was the first thing Gideon was told
[1:07:51] to do hew down the idol in your father's
[1:07:53] house start the conquest there start the
[1:07:57] you know start the you know kicking the
[1:08:00] enemy out started at home first and then
[1:08:02] you can heal then you can you know kick
[1:08:05] them off your land amen the idol you say
[1:08:09] well we don't have any idols I wish I
[1:08:12] had that video of that skit from the
[1:08:13] skit boys how who seen it and and he
[1:08:16] takes a yo he says the oh these these
[1:08:18] people who may paint themselves up and
[1:08:20] they built you know and they build their
[1:08:22] temples and he's got actually photos of
[1:08:24] people tribes from Papua New Guinea you
[1:08:26] only kill it up and feathers and all
[1:08:28] kinds of things what they do and then he
[1:08:30] and the shows a temple and they offer
[1:08:32] sacrifice all these things he says well
[1:08:34] you can't relate to that okay I'll tell
[1:08:36] it again it says now there's people in
[1:08:38] May and they paintin themselves and
[1:08:40] these people go into these rugby matches
[1:08:41] and you know American football they're
[1:08:43] painted blue red white whatever more and
[1:08:45] they build big temples in his big
[1:08:47] Stadium and they offer sacrifices you
[1:08:50] know I was shocked the world's
[1:08:52] chopped but when the Blues played the
[1:08:55] Lions they they they had a special haka
[1:08:58] and you know what the purpose that
[1:08:59] Huckle was isn't the news we're calling
[1:09:02] up the spirit of our ancestors so he can
[1:09:04] defeat this team it was in the New
[1:09:08] Zealand Herald and people just read that
[1:09:10] saying oh that's fine but if you have
[1:09:12] half a Christian brain you would say
[1:09:14] that is ancestor worship that is pagan
[1:09:18] as pagan can be so why on earth would
[1:09:21] you want to identify yourself or your
[1:09:23] children with anything like that
[1:09:25] that's it's insanity and that's how oh
[1:09:31] that's the what do you why they do the
[1:09:32] haka they calling up we need an
[1:09:34] anointing to defeat this enemy there's a
[1:09:37] you know as a soccer team it just comes
[1:09:39] to mind from I think from from from the
[1:09:42] UK and it was like this greatest kind of
[1:09:45] season they've ahead least a city I saw
[1:09:48] y'all might have the name of a totally
[1:09:50] wrong but they like the total underdogs
[1:09:52] in they won what did they and did you
[1:09:54] see what they did before they started
[1:09:55] that season they went to a Buddhist
[1:09:58] temple they went to a Buddhist temple
[1:10:00] and they had a service there's on BBC
[1:10:05] news there's no conspiracy so they went
[1:10:07] to this Buddhist temple and they had the
[1:10:09] service what were they doing
[1:10:11] we need an anointing we want to win this
[1:10:14] trophy we need an anointing the this
[1:10:19] happened I think last year year before
[1:10:21] and they won why because they're calling
[1:10:26] up demon power to win but we're
[1:10:32] Christians you wanna you want to be
[1:10:34] careful what you put before you
[1:10:38] amen you want to be careful the
[1:10:42] influence you put on your children
[1:10:44] especially when they're young when they
[1:10:45] look at you and you're the most please
[1:10:47] whatever you're most pleased with them
[1:10:49] in their life they'll want to be walking
[1:10:50] they'll start running towards that so
[1:10:53] for example if I was just say if my my
[1:10:57] girls just say yeah just say yeah my
[1:10:59] girls they started playing a sport and I
[1:11:01] was the most enthusiastic
[1:11:07] a black stick or a silver fern or you
[1:11:10] know hockey or whatever game they were
[1:11:12] the whole ambition would begin to go
[1:11:14] towards that because I am predicting
[1:11:16] this is what I'm most pleased with with
[1:11:18] you even if they come to church and all
[1:11:21] these things what you're most pleased
[1:11:22] with they want to emulate that they all
[1:11:25] following me so you've got to be number
[1:11:28] one you've got to be dead sure whatever
[1:11:31] they do for the Lord you say I'm so
[1:11:32] proud of you I'm so pleased hallelujah
[1:11:36] you know you got to make that number one
[1:11:38] not not here with something else number
[1:11:41] one because they'll see cuz they want to
[1:11:43] be like you did or you mum they want to
[1:11:45] be like you and so they'll see or mum
[1:11:48] really love dad dad or mum really like
[1:11:50] me doing this so it's like the channels
[1:11:52] their ambition a certain way hello how
[1:11:57] we do it's true people you can't just
[1:12:01] you can't just have a Christian under yo
[1:12:03] are you we're Christians but in reality
[1:12:05] what are you really serving what are you
[1:12:07] placing above him because the family is
[1:12:13] divided because the because the parents
[1:12:16] are looking at other things now let's go
[1:12:24] to Daniel chapter 7
[1:12:30] we're gonna read quite a lengthy reading
[1:12:33] from here Daniel 7 and we're gonna
[1:12:35] reverse one down to verse 23 you've got
[1:12:42] to understand and I trust you do but
[1:12:44] when you look at what is going on in the
[1:12:46] world it is all in the scripture you've
[1:12:49] got to look at the world through
[1:12:51] scriptural eyes because if you do not
[1:12:53] then you'll be caught up in the devil's
[1:12:56] lie and you'll be influenced the wrong
[1:12:58] way okay so if you can see what is
[1:13:01] happening through that through the
[1:13:03] scripture then you can identify oh this
[1:13:06] is this is what he's doing and this is
[1:13:08] what he's doing and this is what God is
[1:13:09] doing amen you got to be able to see and
[1:13:12] that's why it's so important to find
[1:13:14] yourself and Bible characters to go back
[1:13:17] into the scripture and find yourself as
[1:13:20] Nehemiah or David or David's mighty men
[1:13:23] are you with me you know what are those
[1:13:25] because you'll see because if that's the
[1:13:27] shadow that the believers of the New
[1:13:30] Testament are the reality so if they did
[1:13:32] it under the shadow that way and we'll
[1:13:34] do it in the reality hallelujah yes amen
[1:13:39] and you can take the same thing you can
[1:13:41] take the book of Acts you can take that
[1:13:43] New Testament era just from Pentecost to
[1:13:46] the destruction of Jerusalem and you can
[1:13:48] overlay it in this day we live in that's
[1:13:52] probably another time
[1:13:53] now Daniel 7 and 1 in the first year of
[1:13:58] Belshazzar we're going to read this and
[1:14:00] all we'll just yeah we go king of
[1:14:02] Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions
[1:14:04] on us dreams of his heat upon his beard
[1:14:07] when he wrote the dream and told the
[1:14:08] some of the matters and Daniel spake and
[1:14:10] said I saw in my vision by night and
[1:14:12] behold the four winds of heaven strove
[1:14:15] upon the great sea and four great beasts
[1:14:18] come up from the sea diverse one from
[1:14:20] the other now this is the anointing on
[1:14:23] the world power right it's the end and
[1:14:26] we're gonna read about four beasts and
[1:14:27] the fourth beast is the anointing on the
[1:14:30] world power on this day and then I'm
[1:14:33] gonna show you that it breaks and
[1:14:34] destroys and devours the whole earth and
[1:14:36] I'm going to show you the tactic it uses
[1:14:38] in your life and your family life
[1:14:41] because it can't just
[1:14:42] the other Sun lofty thing in the it
[1:14:45] comes down to your Adria comes down to
[1:14:47] my address right that's where we're
[1:14:49] going and so first of all the first was
[1:14:53] like a lion and had eagle's wings and I
[1:14:55] beheld till the wings are over plucked
[1:14:57] and it was lifted up from the earth and
[1:14:59] made stand upon the feet as a man and a
[1:15:02] man's heart was given to it and I beheld
[1:15:04] a second beast and the second was like
[1:15:05] like to a bear and it raised up itself
[1:15:07] on one side and it had three ribs in the
[1:15:10] mouth of it between the teeth of it and
[1:15:13] they said thus unto it arise and devour
[1:15:15] much flesh and after this I beheld and
[1:15:18] lo another like a leopard which had upon
[1:15:21] the back of it four wings of a fowl and
[1:15:23] the Beast had also four heads and
[1:15:26] Dominion was given to it and after this
[1:15:31] I saw in the night vision and behold a
[1:15:34] fourth beast dreadful and terrible and
[1:15:38] strong exceedingly Antti that devoured
[1:15:41] and brake in pieces and stamped the
[1:15:43] residue with the feet of it and it was
[1:15:45] diverse from all the beasts that were
[1:15:47] before it and it had ten horns now what
[1:15:50] happens is that the first piece we read
[1:15:52] about was the it's the same as the image
[1:15:55] of image that the King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:15:56] dreams about of the head of gold and
[1:15:59] silver and you know goes down to iron
[1:16:01] and clay and the feet these are the
[1:16:03] anointings on those four kingdoms okay
[1:16:05] so the first beast we read about was the
[1:16:10] world Empire of Nebuchadnezzar's time
[1:16:11] and the next one was the Medes and
[1:16:14] Persians which took the Babylonian
[1:16:15] Kingdom and then the third one we just
[1:16:17] read about was the Grecian Empire
[1:16:20] because they remember Alexander the
[1:16:22] Great defeated was the Darius and he and
[1:16:25] he took the Empire now the fourth one it
[1:16:29] was diverse from all the beasts ever
[1:16:31] before it and it had ten horns
[1:16:32] everything in the first three is mixed
[1:16:34] into the fourth and I considered the
[1:16:37] horns so in our in verse eight I
[1:16:39] considered the horns and behold there
[1:16:41] came up among them another little horn
[1:16:42] before whom there were three of the
[1:16:45] first horns plucked up by the roots and
[1:16:47] behold in this horn were eyes like the
[1:16:49] eyes of man and a mouth speaking great
[1:16:50] things now remember the Romans conquered
[1:16:55] the Greeks
[1:16:56] and that same anointing is on the world
[1:16:58] power till now that same it's a mule
[1:17:03] power we are living under the world was
[1:17:05] living under that anointing you say well
[1:17:08] there's no Roman Empire anymore that's
[1:17:10] true but it went from went from pagan
[1:17:13] Rome
[1:17:13] it changed the papal Rome and we can
[1:17:16] read about that in Revelations 13 and if
[1:17:19] you go especially into the mo you know
[1:17:21] the Dark Ages even into the room into
[1:17:23] the Renaissance even into today the
[1:17:26] Vatican has has embassies around the
[1:17:29] world and it's not just a church it's a
[1:17:32] country as opposed it's a it's a
[1:17:34] political animal amen
[1:17:37] you go look at you're looking the like
[1:17:40] King Henry the eighth's
[1:17:41] time you know you go look at European
[1:17:44] history politics there's the king and
[1:17:47] who was his Prime Minister ninety-nine
[1:17:49] percent of the time a cardinal and who
[1:17:52] was the Cardinal reporting to the Pope
[1:17:53] and who was the Pope and the Cardinal
[1:17:56] who where was his allegiance it wasn't
[1:17:58] to the king it was to the Pope so so it
[1:18:01] it controlled and it's the same thing
[1:18:04] today just in a different way yeah I
[1:18:07] mean we're anyway but the same thing
[1:18:12] this is this is here now and this
[1:18:15] happens until I beheld till the thrones
[1:18:16] were cast out an Ancient of Days that
[1:18:19] sent his garments were white as wool and
[1:18:21] the hair of his head were like pure wool
[1:18:23] as throne was like the fiery flame and
[1:18:26] his wheels as burning fire a fiery
[1:18:28] stream issued and came forth from before
[1:18:30] him thousands thousands ministered unto
[1:18:33] him and ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:18:35] stood before him the judgment was set
[1:18:37] and the books are open so this is now
[1:18:40] this is now the great white throne
[1:18:41] judgement comes into view so that world
[1:18:44] powers here but then it's destroyed and
[1:18:47] here's the great white throne judgment
[1:18:49] okay and in verse 11 I beheld in because
[1:18:54] of the voice of the great words which
[1:18:55] the horn spake I beheld even till the
[1:18:58] beast was slain and his body destroyed
[1:19:00] and given to the burning flame which is
[1:19:02] the lake of fire as concerning the rest
[1:19:05] of the beasts they had their dominion
[1:19:07] taken away their lives were prolonged
[1:19:08] for a season at a time
[1:19:10] and I saw and the night visions and
[1:19:13] behold one like the son of man came with
[1:19:16] the clouds of heaven and came to the
[1:19:17] Ancient of Days and they brought him
[1:19:19] near before him and there was given him
[1:19:21] Dominion and glory and kingdom and all
[1:19:23] the people nations and languages should
[1:19:26] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[1:19:27] Dominion which shall not pass away and
[1:19:30] his kingdom where that which shall not
[1:19:33] be destroyed now was gonna keep ready
[1:19:37] and I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in
[1:19:39] the midst of my body and the visions of
[1:19:41] my head troubled me and I came nearer
[1:19:44] and I came near one of them that stood
[1:19:46] by and asked him the truth of all this
[1:19:48] and he told me to make and made me know
[1:19:52] the interpretation of of the things
[1:19:55] these great beasts which are four are
[1:19:57] four kings which shall arise out of the
[1:19:59] earth but the Saints of the Most High
[1:20:01] shall take the kingdom and possess the
[1:20:05] kingdom forever even forever and ever
[1:20:08] now we're going to read that there's
[1:20:10] actually well we read there that the
[1:20:12] Saints are given the kingdom but then as
[1:20:14] we read down it all say that there that
[1:20:16] the Saints were made war against now
[1:20:19] worn out but then after judgment are
[1:20:21] given the kingdom now how can this be
[1:20:24] where one in one place it says they're
[1:20:26] given the kingdom and another place the
[1:20:29] Beast makes war against them and wears
[1:20:30] out the Saints of the Most High
[1:20:31] then after judgment they've given the
[1:20:33] kingdom it's because in the ranks member
[1:20:36] Saints being sanctified ones so it is
[1:20:39] all it is the wise and foolish virgin
[1:20:41] are encompassed in this in this verse so
[1:20:44] the wise are given the Kingdom they go
[1:20:46] up in the rapture
[1:20:47] I trust you one of them right but in the
[1:20:50] fullest version of stadia and then this
[1:20:51] beast power wears them out and overcomes
[1:20:53] them but then after judgment they've
[1:20:56] given the kingdom because remember the
[1:20:57] great white throne judgment the the the
[1:20:59] goats and the sheep are separated and
[1:21:01] the Sheep had put it into the kingdom
[1:21:03] and the goats a seat to the lake of fire
[1:21:05] now and then I'd know the truth of the
[1:21:09] fourth feast which was diverse from all
[1:21:11] the others exceedingly dreadful whose
[1:21:13] teeth rose of iron as nails of brass was
[1:21:16] devoured
[1:21:16] breaking pieces and stamped the residue
[1:21:18] with his feet and of the ten horns which
[1:21:21] were in his head and the other and of
[1:21:23] the other which came up
[1:21:24] before whom three fell even of that horn
[1:21:27] that that had eyes and a mouth that
[1:21:28] spake very great things whose look was
[1:21:31] more stout than his fellows I beheld and
[1:21:33] the same horn made war with the Saints
[1:21:35] and prevailed against them as the
[1:21:38] foolish virgin group until the Ancient
[1:21:40] of Days came and the judgment was given
[1:21:42] to the Saints of the Most High and the
[1:21:43] time came that the Saints possessed the
[1:21:47] kingdom thus he said the fourth beast
[1:21:50] shall be the fourth Kingdom upon the
[1:21:51] earth which shall be diverse from all
[1:21:53] kingdoms and shall devour the whole
[1:21:56] earth and shall tread it down and break
[1:21:59] it in pieces so that's what he's going
[1:22:03] to do he's going to devour the whole
[1:22:05] earth he's going to tread it down and
[1:22:07] he's going to break it into pieces and
[1:22:10] the ten horns out of this kingdom of ten
[1:22:14] Kings which shall arise another shall
[1:22:16] maybe I've gone through fer and the ten
[1:22:19] horns out of this kingdom which are ten
[1:22:20] Kings that shall arise in there and
[1:22:22] another shall rise after them and he
[1:22:24] shall be diverse from the first and he
[1:22:26] shall subdue three kings and he shall
[1:22:28] speak great words against the Most High
[1:22:30] and we shall wear out the Saints of the
[1:22:32] Most High and think to change times and
[1:22:34] laws and they shall be given into his
[1:22:36] hand until a time and times and a
[1:22:39] dividing of time so time is one x is two
[1:22:42] and a divided time is half three and a
[1:22:44] half three and a half years the Great
[1:22:45] Tribulation but the judgment shall sit
[1:22:48] and they shall take away his Dominion
[1:22:50] and consume and to destroyed until the
[1:22:52] end and the Kingdom and Dominion and the
[1:22:54] greatness of the kingdom under the whole
[1:22:56] heaven shall be given to the people of
[1:22:57] the saints of the Most High whose
[1:22:59] kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and
[1:23:01] all dominions serve and obey Him here in
[1:23:04] 2 as the end of the matter as for me
[1:23:06] Daniel my cogging Nations much troubled
[1:23:10] me and my countenance changed in me but
[1:23:12] I kept the matter in my heart
[1:23:14] so this you say well that's quite a lot
[1:23:18] of words but he's showing now this is
[1:23:21] what the devil's going to do he's going
[1:23:23] to devour the whole earth he's going to
[1:23:26] break it that he's going to break it
[1:23:27] into pieces and he's gonna treat it down
[1:23:29] as verse 23 so now here's this tactic he
[1:23:33] wants to devalue I'm just going to go
[1:23:36] from the world I'm gonna go down to you
[1:23:38] devour he wants a devalue I want to
[1:23:40] break you to pieces and treat you down
[1:23:42] and you can see we don't I don't know if
[1:23:47] we have time but go read revelations
[1:23:49] chapter 13 after this and it speaks
[1:23:52] about a it speaks about the same fourth
[1:23:54] piece we read about with the ten horns
[1:23:57] and it speaks about the Lamb coming out
[1:24:00] of the earth which is now a nation not
[1:24:03] come coming out of a place where there's
[1:24:05] not much population and that we know is
[1:24:07] America but then it says he he had he
[1:24:11] had he was a he was a lamb but then he
[1:24:14] spake as the dragon so they came a time
[1:24:17] in America's history where they were
[1:24:18] because of lamb is freedom of religion
[1:24:20] they left the old world to comes the new
[1:24:22] world to you know flee from the
[1:24:24] persecution of the denominations there
[1:24:26] they found it they founded the nation as
[1:24:28] one nation under God but then there
[1:24:30] comes a time where it turns and it
[1:24:32] speaks as the dragon speaks so it says
[1:24:35] the same thing that the Vatican is
[1:24:37] saying right and so and you'll see it
[1:24:42] and you know you'll see the tactics of
[1:24:45] the enemy and you can go from I remember
[1:24:48] when I read a book on the Boer War Boer
[1:24:51] War that the that the British they
[1:24:54] wanted the you know you know the gold
[1:24:56] and everything but it was outside their
[1:24:58] territory so they tried to create a
[1:25:02] incident where a group of them went up
[1:25:05] there and they tried to do that you know
[1:25:06] they thought all the British that were
[1:25:08] already there would rise up in arms and
[1:25:09] that overthrow the Bulls and it didn't
[1:25:11] work and then and in that they tried to
[1:25:14] create an incident where we had out
[1:25:16] start a war and they they proceeded with
[1:25:19] it anyway they wanted to devour the
[1:25:21] place and take control you look at now
[1:25:24] this is just me but that is just an
[1:25:28] fellowship I know this is on the
[1:25:29] internet but oh you look at the show
[1:25:31] September 11 you see what the enemy does
[1:25:33] he he he puts people into a place makes
[1:25:37] the place fall apart and he tries to
[1:25:39] clean up the pieces and take control
[1:25:41] you see September 11 have you ever seen
[1:25:44] such wonderful controlled demolition of
[1:25:47] buildings before have you looked at
[1:25:49] videos of controlled demolitions
[1:25:52] the building just goes and then you see
[1:25:55] the two towels gonna do perfectly but
[1:25:58] the planes hit the Midway up like this
[1:26:01] any any structural engineer would look
[1:26:04] at that and say that's crazy how could
[1:26:06] they just go this and there were other
[1:26:07] buildings around that they just
[1:26:09] collapsed as well you say well that is
[1:26:13] that is their building codes really shot
[1:26:15] or it was it was actually created to
[1:26:19] start a war to go devour some countries
[1:26:22] to take control of the resources you go
[1:26:27] look you go look at Wikipedia that
[1:26:29] remember all the stuff you say this is
[1:26:31] crazy no this is what the enemy does but
[1:26:33] you've got to look it through the Bible
[1:26:35] eyes you look it through scripture eyes
[1:26:37] because if you don't you'll be caught up
[1:26:39] in the misinformation out there and
[1:26:41] you'll be twisted one way or another
[1:26:43] yeah you go look at what the CIA has
[1:26:45] done around the world they've
[1:26:47] assassinated presidents they have
[1:26:49] they've armed yo rebel groups to take
[1:26:51] over countries this is in Central and
[1:26:54] South America you should go see what
[1:26:57] they've done the leader of Isis was
[1:27:00] captured by the Americans then he was
[1:27:02] released and then now now Isis came into
[1:27:05] being what's happened and it's been
[1:27:09] known that they've armed other rebel
[1:27:11] groups in Syria oh this is conspiracy no
[1:27:14] it's not this is what the enemy does
[1:27:16] because he wants to create a vacuum then
[1:27:19] I'll come save the day cuz I'm Captain
[1:27:22] America what do you think all the
[1:27:24] Hollywood movies are there was Rambo
[1:27:26] taking out the Soviets in Afghanistan
[1:27:27] and you know all these different yeah
[1:27:30] America is gonna save the day it's
[1:27:33] propaganda saying they're the good guys
[1:27:35] well not really they're not the good
[1:27:38] guys because they're under a beasts
[1:27:40] anointing to break the world into pieces
[1:27:44] and to subdue it you look at the yo you
[1:27:47] look at this world why is this wished
[1:27:48] wisest world and it countries are you
[1:27:51] look at Venezuela standing up against
[1:27:54] America now I'm not saying for or
[1:27:56] against but there's just what happened
[1:27:57] you know was a Hugo Chavez where his
[1:28:00] nameis is not we're going to do our own
[1:28:01] thing and then and then he dies and then
[1:28:05] go
[1:28:05] look at the country now this riding it's
[1:28:07] basically bankrupt it's broken what
[1:28:10] happened with with general I mean the
[1:28:14] main Colonel was a Gaddafi daran daran
[1:28:17] northern Africa what was he doing he's
[1:28:20] just there and then the in the Western
[1:28:23] powers create an incident and then they
[1:28:25] go invade the country they get rid of
[1:28:26] him a look down to chaos
[1:28:28] well controlling the oil and all these
[1:28:31] things you gotta look at through braking
[1:28:34] and then I think countries go on to debt
[1:28:36] then he comes to mr. IMF International
[1:28:40] Monetary Fund will help you or help us
[1:28:43] we'll help you now who do they now who
[1:28:45] does the country answer to you have to
[1:28:49] look at these things look at what's
[1:28:51] going on in America if you if you
[1:28:53] haven't seen the documentary I've only I
[1:28:56] heard brother Lonnie Jenkins preach
[1:28:57] about called the agenda and and the
[1:29:00] agenda it's a film not made by believers
[1:29:02] but they but this but this fellow he it
[1:29:06] was and I think low level politics used
[1:29:08] to write a letter to the editor
[1:29:10] it was often and then one day he wrote
[1:29:13] about the time when he went to a
[1:29:15] communist party convention thing in
[1:29:18] America at the time when the Soviet
[1:29:20] Union was falling apart and the
[1:29:22] Communist Party in America said this is
[1:29:24] how we're going to break America we're
[1:29:26] gonna break immorally we're gonna make
[1:29:29] her a breaker spiritually and will break
[1:29:31] her financially and and then so he wrote
[1:29:35] about that or something along those
[1:29:36] lines and he just got a massive response
[1:29:38] and you go look at America what's
[1:29:40] happened she's been broken spiritually
[1:29:43] she's been broken morally and how much
[1:29:47] did let's just raise the debt ceiling I
[1:29:50] don't know what trillion it is now what
[1:29:54] what and then what happens well who can
[1:29:57] pay the debt off maybe my brother Brown
[1:29:59] who speaks about all these things and he
[1:30:01] says he says the Vatican has the gold
[1:30:03] and The Wall Street has all the paper
[1:30:05] bonds you know their brother paint yo
[1:30:07] you know they've got the documents your
[1:30:09] the bonds but only me and then who's
[1:30:11] going to pay their debt off here comes
[1:30:13] the Vatican and we can help you out we
[1:30:14] have all the gold and then what's
[1:30:16] happened
[1:30:18] it's the Bible is prophecy brother Bram
[1:30:21] speaks about these things
[1:30:23] we are not water and then now you look
[1:30:26] at America look at what's going on with
[1:30:28] these yo yo you're the racism and all
[1:30:30] these things going on
[1:30:31] the country is falling apart why cuz
[1:30:34] it's being it's being devoured by the
[1:30:37] own anointing on itself is devouring
[1:30:39] itself they meant and people take sides
[1:30:44] and you know whatever it is the Bible
[1:30:46] says the world to be drunk let's read
[1:30:49] that and in in Revelations 18 and 1 down
[1:30:52] to verse 5 I'm still talking about
[1:30:57] families by the way but I'm showing you
[1:30:59] this is the tactic of the enemy because
[1:31:02] it's not just national level it comes
[1:31:05] down into your home if you can see what
[1:31:08] he does there you'll see what he does
[1:31:10] down here and then look at what's
[1:31:11] happening and look at look at what what
[1:31:14] what husbands and fathers are betrayed
[1:31:16] of betrayed as in the media Homer
[1:31:20] Simpson he's the he's the typical dad or
[1:31:25] husband these days this is what's being
[1:31:28] projected so what's happened now the
[1:31:33] family is being divided manhood has been
[1:31:36] broken down amen being a real husband a
[1:31:40] real dad that's been broken down I meant
[1:31:43] woman have been lifted up and made
[1:31:46] objects by the fashion world and if you
[1:31:49] looked at your they've done studies
[1:31:51] where because you know how they they
[1:31:54] they put electrodes and stuff on
[1:31:56] people's brains and they see which cuts
[1:31:58] of their brain light up when certain
[1:31:59] things happen you know they do those
[1:32:01] studies they did this study so they took
[1:32:03] me in and they showed them pictures of
[1:32:06] just just objects like a hammer or a
[1:32:08] rake or a tool and and certain
[1:32:10] hemispheres of the brain lit up and then
[1:32:13] they showed those same men pictures of
[1:32:15] of half-naked woman you know these
[1:32:18] models and all these things and the same
[1:32:20] hemispheres lit up and that's showing
[1:32:23] that subconsciously when a man sees a
[1:32:25] woman stripped off naked subconsciously
[1:32:29] he just says she is a tool
[1:32:31] she is not a woman amen and this is what
[1:32:36] the world is now predicted you have to
[1:32:38] be like this certain thing and all it's
[1:32:42] liberating
[1:32:42] no but subconsciously man looks at you
[1:32:44] and says well actually you're just a
[1:32:46] tool so woman have been degraded in this
[1:32:49] day and brother Bram said if you break
[1:32:52] motherhood you break a nation yeah
[1:32:56] that's true and after these things
[1:33:01] revelations 18 and one and after these
[1:33:05] things to me I I wouldn't I don't want
[1:33:08] to be treated as at all
[1:33:10] I feel just an object I'm a person amen
[1:33:14] it's like it's like all you wonderful
[1:33:16] sisters you know two objects don't leave
[1:33:18] the devil trying to grade you down you
[1:33:20] just a a tool you're a daughter of God
[1:33:25] revelations 18 one and after these
[1:33:28] things I saw another angel come down
[1:33:29] from heaven having great power and the
[1:33:31] earth was lightened with his glory and
[1:33:33] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:33:36] saying Babylon the Great is fallen is
[1:33:38] fallen and has become the habitation of
[1:33:40] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:33:42] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:33:44] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[1:33:47] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[1:33:49] the kings earth have committed
[1:33:51] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:33:53] but be of the earth are waxed rich
[1:33:55] through the abundance of her delicacies
[1:33:57] and I heard another voice from heaven
[1:34:00] saying come out of her my people that ye
[1:34:03] be not partakers of her sins that you
[1:34:05] received not of her plagues for her sins
[1:34:07] have reached into unto heaven and God
[1:34:10] hath remembered her iniquities
[1:34:12] now this angel this angel here is
[1:34:15] actually the Ministry of the Prophet
[1:34:16] where the whole earth is lighted with
[1:34:19] his glory and he identifies he
[1:34:22] identifies that Babylon is fallen is
[1:34:25] fallen I mean the the church system has
[1:34:28] fallen and says this is the state of her
[1:34:31] and all nations have been made drunk now
[1:34:35] what is the what is the tip what is the
[1:34:37] West especially water what it mean
[1:34:39] pursue men a woman who pursued we just
[1:34:42] want a good time

[1:35:28] when they're just walking where they go
[1:35:30] from where he's where he's sworn in and
[1:35:32] he's taken I think to the White House

[1:35:36] part of it is they get out of the limo
[1:35:38] and they and they walk along where all
[1:35:40] the people are cheering and I just watch
[1:35:42] the book where they got out there

[1:37:08] float let's build this bit let's rebuild
[1:37:13] Alleluia
[1:37:15] so now dividing and conquering now the
[1:37:22] enemy and I might just actually wind up
[1:37:25] with this I don't want to be too long
[1:37:26] this morning maybe just for just low
[1:37:28] foundation but the enemy today is a
[1:37:30] Roman tactic called divide and conquer
[1:37:32] who's heard of that who all knows about
[1:37:35] hide and conquer now they actually
[1:37:38] adopted that from the Greeks if you go
[1:37:41] read on Wikipedia because what happens
[1:37:43] is the Romans they if they found
[1:37:46] anything good from the place they
[1:37:47] conquered they absorbed it into the
[1:37:49] earth into their military into this
[1:37:52] society so the divide and conquer
[1:37:56] strategy has been used so this is this
[1:37:58] is just one example from from Africa
[1:38:00] which you know I'm sure you're all aware
[1:38:01] of so the Germans and the Belgium's they
[1:38:04] ruled Rwanda and Burundi in a colonial
[1:38:07] capacity now this is just this is just
[1:38:09] verbatim from from Wikipedia the Germans
[1:38:12] used a strategy of divide and conquer by
[1:38:15] placing members of the already dominant
[1:38:17] Tutsi minority in positions of power
[1:38:20] when Belgium took over in 1916 the
[1:38:24] Tutsis and Hutus groups were rearranged
[1:38:27] according to race I mean yeah according
[1:38:29] to race instead of occupation Belgium
[1:38:32] defined tootsies anyone with more than
[1:38:34] ten cows or a long-nosed while who to
[1:38:36] meet someone with less than ten cows and
[1:38:38] a broad knows the socio-economic divide
[1:38:41] between Tutsis and Hutus continued after
[1:38:44] independence and was a major factor in
[1:38:46] the Rwandan genocide the vote what's
[1:38:49] happened now he comes as fourth beast
[1:38:51] power coming into a into a continent
[1:38:54] divide and conquer
[1:38:55] that's how the British they could be
[1:38:57] successful against the Scots as well
[1:38:59] this divide and conquer they meant
[1:39:02] playing playing one clan against the
[1:39:04] other you look at New Zealand here come
[1:39:07] you know you're a read about the musket
[1:39:08] wars before the land Wars where the
[1:39:11] musket Wars come from here come
[1:39:12] missionaries will give you muskets and
[1:39:16] they arm this tribe because it's going
[1:39:18] to help their cause and then this tribe
[1:39:20] massacres this tribe because this tribe
[1:39:23] doesn't have muskets and this one does
[1:39:24] have you read have you read about the
[1:39:27] musket Wars
[1:39:28] what does that divide and conquer and ok
[1:39:34] I'll keep reading so when the Romans
[1:39:35] entered Macedonia from the south and
[1:39:37] defeated King peeresses of Macedon in
[1:39:41] the Battle of of Python and 168 BC
[1:39:47] Macedonia was then divided into four
[1:39:49] republics that were heavily restricted
[1:39:52] from relations one with another and
[1:39:54] other Hellenic States a ruthless purge
[1:39:58] occurred with allegedly anti Roman
[1:40:01] citizens being denounced by their
[1:40:02] compatriots and deported in large
[1:40:04] numbers so they they conquered Macedonia
[1:40:07] and then they divided it this is divide
[1:40:10] and conquer and then during the the
[1:40:12] Gallic Wars Julius Caesar was able to
[1:40:15] use a divide and rule strategy to easily
[1:40:18] defeat the militarily strong Gauls but
[1:40:21] by the time the Gauls
[1:40:22] United it was already too late for them
[1:40:25] divide and conquer and then now he comes
[1:40:29] into your address let's just jump 2,000
[1:40:31] years well more than that from from the
[1:40:33] time of Julius Caesar and he is used he
[1:40:37] is you society to break the family unit
[1:40:39] he has used it to break the family unit
[1:40:47] just just five minutes now it says Dell
[1:40:51] we let's go let's go to Ephesians six
[1:40:56] and for this just read a bit here and in
[1:41:01] animal closer
[1:41:09] now
[1:41:13] it's interesting when you read the book
[1:41:14] of Ephesians it goes from Ephesians 5
[1:41:17] and it speaks about wives and husbands
[1:41:23] relationship about how they become one
[1:41:26] flesh this is what the enemy he doesn't
[1:41:29] want you to be one and all things right
[1:41:33] and then as soon as it goes down from
[1:41:35] that now it goes down to children obey
[1:41:39] your parents this is the family unit and
[1:41:42] then after it speaks about that then it
[1:41:46] says and then it speaks about servants
[1:41:48] and so on and then then it speaks about
[1:41:51] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:41:52] Lord the power of his might and put on
[1:41:54] the whole armor of God and verse 11 so
[1:41:57] he's speaking about now the family needs
[1:41:59] to be one the family needs to be one and
[1:42:02] then you put on the whole armor of God
[1:42:04] then you will stand the enemy okay but
[1:42:08] the power of the whole family unit is
[1:42:10] the oneness between husband or wife if
[1:42:13] that is divided that's why that's why
[1:42:17] it's so important but well actually you
[1:42:19] see it in the world what what the world
[1:42:22] has made marriage to be is not what
[1:42:25] marriage is marriage in the world is
[1:42:29] just a physical relationship that has
[1:42:32] some legal backing and you live in the
[1:42:34] same house as me to create some
[1:42:35] stability to have children and it is to
[1:42:38] have stability it is to have children
[1:42:40] but that's not the but a real a real
[1:42:42] marriage is when you actually take them
[1:42:44] to yourself both ways and you give you
[1:42:48] have to give you a heart to your spouse
[1:42:50] it's not rocket science you actually
[1:42:52] have to give yourself to them just like
[1:42:54] you give yourself to the Lord he's
[1:42:56] already he's already given himself to
[1:42:58] you but you have to respond to his
[1:43:00] giving right so it's the same thing you
[1:43:03] actually have to give your whole self to
[1:43:05] your spouse you cannot hold anything
[1:43:07] back and that's why and that's why you
[1:43:12] see people who who live together than
[1:43:14] they get married
[1:43:15] that's after get married in the trouble
[1:43:17] starts because it was fine then but when
[1:43:19] it when they come to that office of
[1:43:21] husband wife coming together then
[1:43:22] there's a trouble because they haven't
[1:43:24] United themselves with each other
[1:43:27] amen but now it's important we you have
[1:43:36] to make sure you say well I don't it's
[1:43:40] not that way it should be that way it
[1:43:43] should be that way in in the marriage
[1:43:45] union where you can first you have to
[1:43:48] forgive the past and you have to give
[1:43:50] over the right of holding it against
[1:43:52] them amen
[1:43:54] second you have to not only that but
[1:43:58] then you're going to be willing to say
[1:43:59] this person that I've United myself to
[1:44:02] I'm going to take them that's like they
[1:44:04] you know I know there's children here
[1:44:06] but you know the marriage union went to
[1:44:09] become one and the act it's not just a
[1:44:12] physical thing it's a spiritual thing it
[1:44:16] is you know spiritually give yourself
[1:44:17] and then actually spiritually take that
[1:44:20] person to yourself it's not just a
[1:44:22] physical act amen
[1:44:25] and that's why maybe beforehand before
[1:44:28] you got married it was it was fine but
[1:44:29] then afterwards is something wrong there
[1:44:33] has to be a oneness between husband and
[1:44:36] wife and the word has promised it in the
[1:44:38] state you say I don't know if we can
[1:44:41] obtain two that the word has promised it
[1:44:42] and so you got to really look into the
[1:44:45] scripture and say well what is really
[1:44:47] marriage I'm going to close on this
[1:44:49] justice or what is really mad because
[1:44:51] what marriage is painted out there is
[1:44:53] not marriage all that is is a ceremony
[1:44:56] or maybe an exchanging of rings and
[1:44:57] maybe some you know at a honeymoon and
[1:44:59] whatever more and now we live in the
[1:45:01] same house that's not real marriage we
[1:45:06] have some musicians to come I'm just
[1:45:08] gonna continue this next Sunday I don't
[1:45:10] want to be too long as I got too much I
[1:45:12] feel I got too much how am i fall but I
[1:45:14] want you to go think about these things
[1:45:16] because you say well how do we how do we
[1:45:20] keep the world out you may not this you
[1:45:23] can't stop it trying to get in but I
[1:45:25] tell you if you if you're one with your
[1:45:29] spouse that there's a oneness in this
[1:45:32] layers of protection amen and if the
[1:45:35] word is preeminent then then there's
[1:45:37] another layer of protection
[1:45:39] and it's a child's duty now we should we
[1:45:42] should live in such a way that we do not
[1:45:45] provoke as it says in the scripture do
[1:45:47] not provoke your your fathers do not
[1:45:50] provoke your children to anger at least
[1:45:53] they'd be discourages this is Colossians
[1:45:55] 3 and 21 so it says children obey your
[1:45:58] parents and all things for this is well
[1:46:00] pleasing unto the Lord and father's
[1:46:02] provoke not your children to anger at
[1:46:04] least they be discouraged so we should
[1:46:06] live a life we should live a life that
[1:46:08] that when we when we expect our children
[1:46:12] to obey us that it doesn't actually make
[1:46:16] them angry we should live a life that
[1:46:17] makes it easy for them to obey us I mean
[1:46:20] we shouldn't say take this toothbrush
[1:46:22] now this is a ridiculous example but
[1:46:25] that's how some people are they they put
[1:46:27] the bar way too high for their children
[1:46:30] you know slark if I seem to endless or
[1:46:33] Lilia here's these toothbrushes you have

[1:46:43] impossible for them and they've become
[1:46:45] discouraged we can't do the standards
[1:46:47] and they'd probably cry and all these
[1:46:49] things they don't know how to express I
[1:46:50] can't do this and you know I know that's
[1:46:53] a ridiculous example that's how
[1:46:54] sometimes we you know we sit there by
[1:46:56] way too high
[1:46:58] amen we should live in such a way and
[1:47:01] speak to them in such a way that it's
[1:47:03] not because if they get this if they
[1:47:05] become angry they get frustrated and
[1:47:06] they become discouraged in the Lord
[1:47:08] because if they can obey us how can they
[1:47:11] obey God amen we'll pick it up next time
