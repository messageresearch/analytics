[8:27] different bed you kind of like don't
[8:29] sleep that well you know it's not your
[8:31] usual environment you look up you look
[8:33] around it's not the things aren't where
[8:34] they should be you don't sleep as well
[8:36] no problem there no
[8:39] yeah I had an awful sleep last night can
[8:42] I just say that but I didn't actually
[8:45] stay here though so do you want to hear
[8:47] the
[8:49] story I I I was so tired I think I've
[8:52] been overw worked and kind of but run
[8:55] down so you just get more and more tired
[8:57] as the days go on less sleep you kind of
[8:58] just run down down down down and then
[9:00] last night I was up till the we hours of
[9:02] the morning and then I'm actually
[9:03] staying at home cuz we had just worked
[9:05] bit that way but man I was so tired when
[9:08] I got back and I thought I'll just lay
[9:10] on the on the couch for a second and
[9:13] then that was it bang I was gone suit
[9:15] and all you know woke up this morning
[9:17] about 6:45 cuz I had to leave about 7:30
[9:19] I'm like man and my you know when that
[9:21] you don't really plan it the sleep so
[9:23] it's just cushions and your neck's going
[9:24] all weird and you're like yeah so and I
[9:27] had the sore throat you know when you're
[9:29] your throat swells up you're like oh
[9:31] man but but that uh but a little sore
[9:36] throat ain't going to stop you know
[9:38] you're from going to church or something
[9:39] you know like like what did we hear last
[9:41] night
[9:42] presson you know I I
[9:46] I I've got a confidence in people PE
[9:48] people have got such powerful creatures
[9:51] you know we're such amazing beings the
[9:53] Lord's made us so powerful you know that
[9:55] we can press in we can have when even
[9:58] and when we serve God and let the
[10:00] character of God come and and let God
[10:03] work on our character we can have so
[10:04] much resolve you know we can have so
[10:06] much tenacity we can have so much
[10:09] ability to press forward you believe
[10:11] that that's that's who you are we're not
[10:13] we're not just little unimportant things
[10:15] that weren't made very well we were made
[10:17] very good you know and and the Lord made
[10:20] us
[10:21] outstanding and and you know we we we've
[10:23] got this ability to press in to the Lord
[10:25] and
[10:26] and but you know the the the the great
[10:29] thing thing about it is is that when we
[10:30] when that all sort of comes to an end
[10:31] and sometimes it does our our inability
[10:33] to press on kind of even no matter how
[10:36] strong we are there's actually comes a
[10:37] point where we're like man I just can't
[10:39] do it anymore and the great thing about
[10:41] being a Christian is that at that point
[10:43] there's this there's this power of the
[10:45] Holy Ghost that has got the ability in
[10:47] that situation to come in and to keep
[10:49] you going and to press you through
[10:51] anything any situation any obstacle this
[10:54] is inexhaustible Fountain of strength
[10:56] that we can draw on that and brother
[11:00] Andrew said it last night he asked about
[11:03] the he said I I think he mentioned
[11:05] brother Chris or you know when you're
[11:07] when you're looking in the mirror and
[11:08] you're wife here do you say I'm
[11:10] undefeatable I tell you this about a
[11:12] month ago I wasn't quite looking in the
[11:14] mirror but I was sitting in the car and
[11:15] there was a mirror there so maybe that
[11:16] counts brother
[11:18] Andrew and in light of saying or this
[11:20] what I just said to you there I was just
[11:22] expounding it to Shannon and at the end
[11:23] I said and you know what I'm
[11:28] undefeatable but you we all are that's
[11:30] who we are we are
[11:33] undefeatable if it started back here and

[49:27] vision he has uh he's put something
[49:30] inside of us that we cannot explain but
[49:33] we believe amen and uh this morning we
[49:36] just trust that uh you feel his presence
[49:39] that we can just relax in his presence
[49:41] this morning and and feed on his word
[49:43] amen I just want to greet you in the
[49:45] lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[49:47] bring you greetings from Canada and uh
[49:50] there so many connections and families
[49:52] and friends so we wouldn't have time to

[49:55] but we just want to extend you uh u a
[49:58] greetings from your extended family amen
[50:00] the family of God on the other side of
[50:02] the world Amen and I just uh just
[50:05] counted a real honor real privilege to
[50:07] be standing here in front of you today
[50:09] want to say thank you to brother Ben for
[50:10] inviting me not for preaching but so
[50:13] that I can be here in this atmosphere
[50:16] and here our brother Andrew Minister
[50:18] it's the first time I I get to meet
[50:19] brother Andrew and and here and Minister
[50:22] and I just want to say I was truly
[50:23] blessed last night how many enjoyed the
[50:25] word last night amen
[50:28] last after last night we could just wrap
[50:30] up the services and go home that's how I
[50:32] felt but uh anyway we find ourselves
[50:35] here this morning and uh we're just
[50:37] going to trust in the Lord amen what
[50:39] we're going to keep building one brick
[50:40] upon brick and uh word upon word and
[50:43] precept upon precept line upon line amen
[50:46] so at this at this time I just invite
[50:48] you to turn with me in your Bibles to
[50:50] the Book of Luke 4:
[50:53] 16 Luke 4 and 16 and I want to speak
[50:57] this morning uh on a on a kind of a
[51:00] topic living in the Supernatural
[51:02] atmosphere living in the Supernatural
[51:05] atmosphere I believe that um the Lord
[51:07] has done something for us as Believers
[51:10] amen we are uh we've been called uh out
[51:13] from the uh influences of this world
[51:15] we've been called out from the
[51:17] influences of the devil you know the
[51:19] devil has no say over us he has no to do
[51:21] with us amen uh we are hidden hidden in
[51:25] Christ and if the Lord is is allmighty
[51:28] and all powerful which we believe he is
[51:31] if he hides somebody I would say he's
[51:33] pretty good at that and so if we are
[51:35] hidden in Christ how can the devil even
[51:37] know where you are know how to attack
[51:39] you how can he even touch you affect you
[51:42] amen so we've been called to live in
[51:44] Heavenly places this is the Ephesian
[51:46] time this is the uh you know brother
[51:48] brandom says that we will come into our
[51:50] Ephesian amen and for those of you who
[51:53] understand the message we know that that
[51:54] is literally coming into the the full
[51:56] stature of a perfect man that is Christ
[51:59] in us you know it comes a day when you
[52:02] can't you it's hard to to um discern
[52:04] where the line is where Christ begins
[52:06] and where where we begin or where we uh
[52:09] end and he ends amen there's just this
[52:11] uh beautiful merging of of Christ with
[52:14] his people the mystery of Christ in us
[52:17] but you know we we have this Warfare
[52:19] that that we contend with and and that
[52:21] is that we live in this carnal kind of
[52:23] uh environment this this world of
[52:26] carnality and we live with this flesh we
[52:28] got to drag this guy around everywhere
[52:30] and yet the Bible tells us that we are
[52:32] living now we are now in Heavenly places
[52:35] in Christ Jesus so what do we do with
[52:37] this how do we how do we uh uh put these
[52:40] two together amen because uh you know as
[52:43] as we know that uh we've got to face
[52:45] this guy we've got to face our our
[52:47] reasonings our our mind we've got to
[52:49] we've got to deal with that and and yet
[52:51] as we heard last night God has given us
[52:52] another sense to contact him with amen
[52:56] and something that holds us something
[52:57] that keeps us it inspires us gives us
[53:00] the right Mo uh uh gives us the right
[53:01] strength the right faith for the moment
[53:04] that we living in and so there's this
[53:06] there's this interesting kind of a
[53:08] parallel existence and I want to just
[53:10] speak about this a little bit today and
[53:12] I trust it will just shine a light on
[53:15] how we live where we live amen and and
[53:17] how we deal with some of these issues
[53:19] that we face in our lives and also uh uh
[53:22] understanding who we are amen and and
[53:26] our position here in Christ that we have
[53:28] a purpose amen he did not just save us
[53:30] just so that we can clean our lives up
[53:32] and have a a nice little life here and
[53:34] and uh no he's got a purpose for you
[53:36] amen he and you'll find out today in the
[53:38] scriptures that he needs you he needs
[53:41] you the Lord Almighty needs you he needs
[53:43] your hands and uh I think that is uh
[53:46] it's hard to understand it's hard to
[53:47] really fully grasp but as we just take
[53:50] the scriptures we take what the prophet
[53:52] says you know he needs you and we need
[53:55] him and so so that is how we are
[53:57] complete amen if you'll just look at
[53:59] this verse here in in Luke 4 and6 it
[54:03] says and he came to Nazareth I love when
[54:06] the when the Holy Spirit begins to move
[54:08] when God you know he begins to move he's
[54:11] got a a purpose he's got a intention
[54:13] amen and I love to see what his motives
[54:16] are amen when he was coming to Nazareth
[54:19] this is the place of his birth and so on
[54:21] and and it was a kind of a not very well
[54:23] spoken of place you know it's just kind
[54:25] of a forgotten place
[54:27] you know not it was not the capital it
[54:29] was not anything special but he came to
[54:31] Nazareth and it says where he had been
[54:34] brought up and as his custom was he went
[54:36] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[54:39] and stood up for it to read and there
[54:41] was delivered unto him the book of the
[54:43] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[54:45] the book he found the place where it was
[54:48] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[54:51] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[54:53] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[54:56] heal the Brokenhearted to preach
[54:58] Deliverance to the captives and
[55:00] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[55:02] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[55:04] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[55:07] and he stops there it's a period in my
[55:09] Bible now if you go back to the book of
[55:11] Isaiah it goes on but he knows where to
[55:15] stop he knows his portion in the word
[55:18] amen why don't we just bow our heads
[55:20] just for a moment Lord we thank you for
[55:22] the reading of your word we thank you
[55:24] for this opportunity to Stand Here Lord
[55:25] I just feel so inadequate Lord to to
[55:28] open this word that that is on my heart
[55:30] today but father I just want to get out
[55:32] of the way father I want to become so
[55:34] small in your presence this morning so
[55:36] that you can speak Lord and and that you
[55:38] can bring us strength you can bring us
[55:40] Faith encourage us in your word this
[55:42] morning as we open your word L God as we
[55:45] read Lord as as when you were reading
[55:48] the these words you knew your place in
[55:50] the in the scriptures you knew exactly
[55:53] the timing the placing Lord everything
[55:55] was so perfect father that's our desire
[55:57] today we want to see ourselves in your
[55:59] word today we want to see our placing we
[56:02] want to see our position and so Lord and
[56:04] we know that those things will give us
[56:05] courage for the for the journey that we
[56:07] face so we commit the reading of your
[56:09] word now Lord and we ask for your
[56:11] blessing we thank you for this service
[56:14] in Jesus Christ's name amen may have
[56:16] your seats for a
[56:20] moment well praise the Lord what a what
[56:23] an interesting uh set of scriptures that
[56:25] we read this morning as we could imagine
[56:27] what it would have been like that day in
[56:29] the in the synagogue a place of worship
[56:31] a place where it was normal for them to
[56:33] hand a scroll to somebody and he would
[56:35] read from it and it was encouraging and
[56:37] so forth but this day was a little bit
[56:39] different it was a little extra special
[56:41] and my brother and sister it's amazing
[56:43] how that when the Lord comes and and and
[56:45] you find eternity kind of uh mixing with
[56:48] with this time zone that we're in this
[56:51] this this life that we are in where
[56:53] everything is is is governed by time and
[56:55] we have a an eternal being who comes and
[56:57] he and he comes and it's like it's like
[56:59] all those things everything just starts
[57:01] to fit together you know the Wheels of
[57:03] Time and Eternity everything starts to
[57:05] connect and there's this harmony and and
[57:08] and here he comes and here's the word
[57:09] made flesh and he picks up the scroll
[57:12] that's handed to him amen now it wasn't
[57:15] a mistake that that scroll was handed to
[57:17] him the Lord knew exactly how this was
[57:19] going to play out amen he was just
[57:21] walking in the vision he he knew exactly
[57:23] who he was he had complete confidence
[57:26] and who he was amen and I believe that
[57:29] we as Believers we should have
[57:30] confidence in who we are we should not
[57:32] be afraid of the world out there we
[57:34] should not be afraid of the places we
[57:36] have to walk we should not be afraid of
[57:37] school or be afraid of work or or the
[57:40] challenges that we face because of who
[57:42] we are and here we find God walking in
[57:46] flesh literally and coming into his his
[57:48] synagogue the place that is dedicated to
[57:51] worship him it's amazing how that they
[57:53] in their religious system they were just
[57:55] con constantly missing what was
[57:57] happening constantly Off the Mark but
[58:00] here he comes he was not afraid of those
[58:02] things amen he was not afraid that they
[58:04] were missing him or that they were were
[58:06] rejecting him or that they were going to
[58:07] misunderstand him he came anyhow why
[58:10] because there was a people who would
[58:12] receive him there was a people who would
[58:15] understand the way that he understood
[58:16] when he read the scriptures so we find
[58:19] him he says to preach the acceptable
[58:22] year of the Lord and on verse 21 he goes
[58:25] on and he began to say unto them this
[58:27] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[58:30] ears this should have pricked something
[58:32] something should have happened right
[58:33] here in the synagogue with all these
[58:35] people they should have realized
[58:36] something is happening and Lord open my
[58:39] eyes open my ears open my heart to
[58:41] receive what is taking place this is not
[58:44] a regular service you know why it was
[58:46] not a regular service because he was
[58:48] there he was there to fulfill his word
[58:51] he was there to to manifest who he is he
[58:54] was there to show that he knows what
[58:56] Isaiah wrote he was the Holy Spirit that
[58:58] inspired Isaiah to wrote those words
[59:00] because he knew he would be walking into
[59:02] the synagogue and he would be saying
[59:04] these
[59:06] things he began to say unto them this
[59:09] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[59:10] ears and I and I want to just clarify
[59:13] here it wasn't you know here is God
[59:16] Almighty wrapped in a in a robe of human
[59:19] flesh and we don't find that that that
[59:21] people were understanding who he was you
[59:24] know people did not recognize what was
[59:26] happening and yet he was saying very
[59:28] clearly and we can read it in in English
[59:31] today that this day is the scripture
[59:34] fulfilled in your ears they it was clear
[59:36] it was plainly said it was said in
[59:38] public it was said in the place of
[59:40] worship where these things should come
[59:42] from and yet they did not hear what he
[59:45] was saying they could not understand
[59:47] what he was saying but nonetheless the
[59:49] word had to be said nonetheless these
[59:52] things had to be clarified it had to be
[59:54] done in front of witnesses it had to be
[59:56] done in front of an audience and to me
[59:59] it like if you can imagine God coming
[1:00:01] down and and he's going to pick up the
[1:00:03] scroll and he's going to read from his
[1:00:05] own book he's going to read what the
[1:00:07] prophet said about himself and look at
[1:00:09] the restraint that he has he could have
[1:00:13] said excuse me everybody pick up your
[1:00:15] notebooks and write this down he who is
[1:00:18] standing in front of you is the one who
[1:00:20] the scriptures is talking about you know
[1:00:22] he could have gone into great depth and
[1:00:24] great detail to explain what was
[1:00:26] happening but there was somebody there
[1:00:28] there's people there there's a people
[1:00:30] today who can read these same words and
[1:00:32] it has a different effect upon us why
[1:00:35] because we can see between the lines and
[1:00:38] it's not just that we intellectually can
[1:00:40] see between the lines I want to be very
[1:00:41] clear about what I'm saying here today
[1:00:43] we see ourself in the things that he is
[1:00:46] talking about amen we are
[1:00:50] identified because we read the same
[1:00:52] scriptures and we identify ourselves
[1:00:54] with the same word
[1:00:56] Hallelujah all right and he said verily
[1:01:00] I say this is verse 24 and he said
[1:01:02] verily I say unto you no Prophet is
[1:01:04] accepted in his own country I mean it's
[1:01:07] it's so profound here the scriptures are
[1:01:09] being fulfilled the the the everything
[1:01:11] is being manifested everything's coming
[1:01:13] to life he is there personally to make
[1:01:16] sure the right things are read the right
[1:01:17] things are exposed and and unveiled and
[1:01:20] yet he he he kind of ends his sermon
[1:01:23] what a what a way to end a sermon Hey
[1:01:24] Brother Andrew it's not a high note it's
[1:01:27] not a high note it's kind of like here's
[1:01:29] a warning for you instead instead of us
[1:01:32] having a Revival here's a warning for
[1:01:34] you no Prophet is received no Prophet is
[1:01:38] received in his own country do you think
[1:01:40] that the prophet we have received would
[1:01:42] be received in his own country is
[1:01:43] already been spoken no Prophet is
[1:01:45] accepted in his own country so
[1:01:48] everything is playing out exactly
[1:01:50] according to scripture we shouldn't be
[1:01:52] surprised about the the way things are
[1:01:54] going in the United States
[1:01:56] amen we shouldn't be surprised about
[1:01:58] notice how I didn't say Canada but you
[1:02:00] know the well I just got to stay with
[1:02:02] the scriptures
[1:02:04] amen but you see what he's doing here
[1:02:07] he's clarifying don't be surprised this
[1:02:10] is how it is amen and these are
[1:02:12] characteristics these are the
[1:02:14] identifiers the markers so that we as
[1:02:16] Believers can see these things happening
[1:02:18] and it will just bring a rest and a
[1:02:20] peace this is what he has declared no
[1:02:23] Prophet is received in his own country
[1:02:25] and then goes in and it's amazing how
[1:02:27] how the Lord now he goes to bring
[1:02:29] Parables or or you know he always brings
[1:02:31] Parables he brings a story he brings
[1:02:34] something to illuminate what he's
[1:02:35] talking about and but in this case he
[1:02:38] doesn't bring Parables he doesn't bring
[1:02:40] you know a a story as as such you know
[1:02:43] this is like the kingdom of heaven or
[1:02:45] like this he's not trying to explain
[1:02:46] this he's just going to give you live
[1:02:48] examples he's going to give you factual
[1:02:50] events to clarify what he is talking
[1:02:53] about and these events should identify
[1:02:57] who he is and what is happening in their
[1:03:01] midst oh my this is where this is where
[1:03:04] to me it becomes so precious because
[1:03:06] he's now going to go back in history and
[1:03:08] he's going to pick up
[1:03:10] people people people who had nothing to
[1:03:14] do with fulfilling the word of God they
[1:03:16] had nothing to offer they had no
[1:03:18] resources amen they had no ability to
[1:03:21] bring these things to pass and yet he's
[1:03:23] going to go and use these people now to
[1:03:25] clarify what he's talking about what is
[1:03:28] the scene what is the what is the uh the
[1:03:30] Nugget what is the trying to unveil and
[1:03:33] yet he has veiled the whole truth of
[1:03:36] what he's talking about in these
[1:03:37] people's lives it's veiled in there so
[1:03:41] we have to go back to these stories we
[1:03:43] have to go back to these lives to pick
[1:03:46] it apart like a like a surgeon would to
[1:03:48] find out what is the the thing what is
[1:03:51] the mystery that he has veiled in these
[1:03:53] stories
[1:03:55] and not to be afraid even though the
[1:03:57] that no Prophet is accepted in his own
[1:03:59] country even though they rejected him in
[1:04:02] his own synagogue my brother and sister
[1:04:04] yet there is the stories that are there
[1:04:06] for our example today and we need to go
[1:04:08] see what he was talking
[1:04:09] about in verse 26 he's is he's just
[1:04:13] coming out of explaining how that there
[1:04:14] are many widows in the time of Elias or
[1:04:17] Elijah and so in verse 26 it says but
[1:04:20] unto none of them was Elijah sent save
[1:04:23] unto serepta a city of red on unto a
[1:04:26] woman that was a widow in other words
[1:04:29] there was many widows in the time of
[1:04:31] Elijah but only one of them received a
[1:04:35] prophet only one of them was a prophet
[1:04:38] uh sent unto this is interesting why why
[1:04:41] is he talking about this try and put
[1:04:42] yourself here's here's what we need to
[1:04:44] do this morning try and put yourself in
[1:04:46] the shoes of these people who are
[1:04:48] listening to Jesus talking what is he
[1:04:51] saying what has this got to do with what
[1:04:53] you just read what what is happening see
[1:04:56] these are all the he's giving us all the
[1:04:58] keys so that we can unlock the truths
[1:05:00] that are in these scriptures amen and so
[1:05:04] he didn't explain it all but he gives us
[1:05:06] the the road marks uh the road the
[1:05:09] markers right so we can go back oh he
[1:05:11] said something about Elijah and a widow
[1:05:13] woman we should go back and find out
[1:05:14] what happened in that story who's Elijah
[1:05:17] who's the Widow
[1:05:20] womanl and many he says in verse 27 and
[1:05:23] many lepers were in Israel in the time
[1:05:25] of elishah
[1:05:27] elisius the prophet and none of them was
[1:05:30] cleansed saving non the Syrian now he is
[1:05:33] he is now he's picked up on a
[1:05:35] gentile amen and they saying there was
[1:05:38] many lepers in the time of of of the
[1:05:41] story on the time of Elisha right which
[1:05:44] is another Prophet now so he's picked up
[1:05:46] on two prophets right catch this Elijah
[1:05:49] Elisha and in both stories there was
[1:05:51] there was only one person who would
[1:05:53] receive healing or Deliverance in
[1:05:55] Elijah's story there was there was one
[1:05:58] widow woman out of all the widows of
[1:06:00] that time in Elisha's story there was
[1:06:02] one leper out of all the lepers of that
[1:06:05] time who would be healed what is he
[1:06:08] trying to
[1:06:10] say he's not messing around he's not you
[1:06:13] know this is not just poetic license or
[1:06:15] bragging rights no he's being very clear
[1:06:18] about the the circumstances about a
[1:06:20] prophet being sent to a land to a time
[1:06:23] uh one Prophet being sent to a widow
[1:06:25] woman Prophet being sent to a a a king a
[1:06:29] king's um uh Captain right a king's
[1:06:32] Captain this is the Syrian this Gentile
[1:06:34] was the was the captain of of an army
[1:06:36] and so what is he talking about but he
[1:06:38] was the one leper that would be healed
[1:06:41] in a time of many lepers now some people
[1:06:43] would go wow what an what an unjust God
[1:06:46] what an unloving God The God Who Could
[1:06:49] heal the God who has power to do all
[1:06:53] things if we live in a silver spoon kind
[1:06:55] of a society where we expect everything
[1:06:58] to be handed to us and we start talking
[1:07:01] and the message ranks about a God who is
[1:07:02] Almighty and who can do anything
[1:07:05] whenever you can ask whatever you want
[1:07:07] and we kind of forget this this portion
[1:07:10] where we we we see what he's doing here
[1:07:13] in the scriptures that everything
[1:07:15] happens according to his
[1:07:17] will and so when we don't get a response
[1:07:20] when we don't get a healing or we don't
[1:07:22] get something that we're asking for
[1:07:25] right just asking for now I'm not
[1:07:26] talking about when the Lord has revealed
[1:07:28] something to you I'm talking about just
[1:07:30] in general just a a Prosperity Gospel
[1:07:32] when we don't get those things we become
[1:07:34] discouraged and we are we start to doubt
[1:07:36] and we start to disbelieve or reason my
[1:07:39] brother and sister what is he trying to
[1:07:41] show us here that everything works
[1:07:43] according to his will for a plan for a
[1:07:46] purpose and he sees you he knows about
[1:07:49] you he knows everything that's going on
[1:07:51] in your life even brother brandom look
[1:07:53] at this man who who had healing camp
[1:07:55] pains he had had had great
[1:07:57] demonstrations of Miracles and and
[1:07:59] discernment and all these things and yet
[1:08:01] he himself was sick to the end of his
[1:08:03] ministry why was that because God had a
[1:08:06] mystery in his life it was there for a
[1:08:08] reason Paul was was buffeted over and
[1:08:11] over and it was there for a reason it
[1:08:13] was so that it would harness the amount
[1:08:15] of Revelation he would
[1:08:17] have amen it was there for a reason the
[1:08:20] things that are happening in your life
[1:08:22] are very carefully very carefully
[1:08:26] planned out you might say but what a
[1:08:28] cruel God we have I've had this happen
[1:08:30] in my life I've Lo lost a loved one or
[1:08:33] my my son or my daughter's not serving
[1:08:35] God or whatever the thing may be today
[1:08:37] or I have a sickness God knows about
[1:08:39] those things he's in control of your
[1:08:42] life everything works together for our
[1:08:45] good amen so it's about trusting in the
[1:08:48] Lord and and this is really what what
[1:08:50] he's coming to represent to us that he
[1:08:52] is in control that his will will play
[1:08:56] out I mean can you imagine in the day of
[1:08:58] of widows you can just imagine Elijah
[1:09:02] making his way to the woman of zerath
[1:09:04] right that little widow woman and it's
[1:09:08] you know he couldn't he couldn't go to
[1:09:10] any other Widow and this is a time of
[1:09:12] drought a time of of need a time of of
[1:09:16] great distress no doubt there was many
[1:09:19] widows and here he is making his way
[1:09:22] he's the prophet everybody knows who
[1:09:25] align is here he is walking down the
[1:09:27] street you can imagine how many widows
[1:09:29] would have invited him would have liked
[1:09:31] for him to come into their home and yet
[1:09:33] he's walking down the street why because
[1:09:36] something I don't want to get ahead of
[1:09:37] myself but something was inside of him
[1:09:40] that was connected to a widow woman that
[1:09:43] was waiting in a in a in a in her yard
[1:09:45] was waiting in the front yard amen and
[1:09:47] she was she was it was her last day her
[1:09:51] conditions were dire but something
[1:09:52] connected him to that widow woman
[1:09:55] and those two were connected to
[1:09:58] God and the story I mean it had to play
[1:10:00] out exactly because Jesus Christ was
[1:10:02] going to stand in the synagogue one day
[1:10:05] and he was going to use this example can
[1:10:08] you imagine how God uh orchestrated the
[1:10:11] the prophet's footsteps to make sure
[1:10:14] that he makes it to that one widow woman
[1:10:17] no other widow woman would receive him
[1:10:18] into his
[1:10:21] home the same with a
[1:10:24] leper and then then we say well God is
[1:10:26] so cruel he could have done all this he
[1:10:27] could have healed all the all the lepers
[1:10:29] he could have no he's got a plan he's
[1:10:31] got a purpose and for us is to have
[1:10:33] confidence and to be able to trust in
[1:10:35] his plan amen we we want to be stable in
[1:10:40] our walk with the Lord our faith should
[1:10:42] be anchored on something solid it should
[1:10:44] be anchored on on something that is
[1:10:46] eternal amen because you know nothing
[1:10:49] that is is formed against us can
[1:10:53] prosper oh my
[1:10:56] I better get back to my
[1:10:57] notes okay now we have we have we have
[1:11:01] two accounts two very very opposing kind
[1:11:04] of stories very opposites and I believe
[1:11:07] it's because the Lord is trying to uh
[1:11:09] cover all all the grounds right so we
[1:11:11] have a widow woman who is headless she
[1:11:13] does not have a head right in in her
[1:11:16] life she has lost her head her husband
[1:11:18] who is her provider so she is without
[1:11:21] provision right so she is alone she does
[1:11:24] not have the means to to look after
[1:11:25] herself financially and so this is this
[1:11:28] is amazing because remember the Lord
[1:11:30] said to Elijah he says I have chosen I
[1:11:34] have commanded I have picked out I have
[1:11:37] commanded a widow woman to sustain you a
[1:11:40] widow woman now in our churches uh
[1:11:42] brother Ben correct me if I'm wrong but
[1:11:44] in our churches we you know the the Lord
[1:11:47] has instituted he has he has he has
[1:11:49] given us offices to look after widow
[1:11:52] woman amen the deacons right that we
[1:11:55] have offices in the church we have we
[1:11:57] have the resources the the the church
[1:11:59] looks after the Widow wom
[1:12:03] amen maybe we just do that in Canada but
[1:12:06] we look after the widow woman it's our
[1:12:08] privilege it's our the the Lord blesses
[1:12:10] the church so that we can in turn bless
[1:12:12] and look after the widows that have lost
[1:12:14] their their means to provide fors amen
[1:12:17] and so that is a privilege that we have
[1:12:19] as a church it's a strength coming from
[1:12:21] the church through the church through
[1:12:23] the Deacon board looking after the
[1:12:25] widows and that's such a blessed thing
[1:12:27] to have but but now he's saying I have
[1:12:29] ch I have commanded a widow woman to
[1:12:32] sustain you it's the opposite way around
[1:12:34] now a woman that does not have the
[1:12:36] resources a woman who is supposed to be
[1:12:38] receiving resources who's who who has no
[1:12:41] strength of her own she cannot give
[1:12:44] anything she has nothing to offer she
[1:12:46] does not have a husband she doesn't have
[1:12:48] anything uh uh going for her if we can
[1:12:50] say it like that but he chooses this
[1:12:53] type of a woman
[1:12:55] who was nothing who had nothing but he
[1:12:58] chooses her he says I have past tense
[1:13:02] commanded a widow woman to sustain you
[1:13:04] the
[1:13:05] prophet wait I I thought it was the
[1:13:07] prophets sustaining the
[1:13:10] bride oh what's he
[1:13:12] saying what's he talking about I I
[1:13:14] thought the the the ministry was there
[1:13:17] to sustain and it was supposed to flow
[1:13:18] down to the widows but in this case he's
[1:13:21] saying this widow woman who has no
[1:13:23] resources has no abilities is going
[1:13:25] going to sustain the profit of the
[1:13:30] day oh who are you
[1:13:34] anyway amen who are you what does God
[1:13:38] what does God see in your life you might
[1:13:40] say brother Chris I have nothing my life
[1:13:42] is a mess I am down to my last
[1:13:46] meal H I've come to this Camp it's it's
[1:13:49] I'm giving God one more chance I'm
[1:13:51] giving him one more shot I I've I've
[1:13:53] reached the end of my my strength oh
[1:13:56] you're perfect you're absolutely perfect
[1:14:01] because do you think God made a mistake
[1:14:02] when he chose her he needed her to be
[1:14:05] exactly in that condition he allowed
[1:14:08] things to happen in her life I know this
[1:14:10] is going to sound cruel but he allowed
[1:14:12] things to happen in her
[1:14:14] life where she did not understand why
[1:14:17] God would take her husband in such a
[1:14:20] time of of a drought and the things that
[1:14:22] are happening in the land lord why would
[1:14:24] you take take my husband from me he was
[1:14:26] moving her closer into the word he was
[1:14:29] putting her right in the right position
[1:14:32] the right condition so that he can use
[1:14:34] her he needed her in that condition in
[1:14:37] other words in her flesh God would bring
[1:14:40] Glory unto himself out of her
[1:14:43] weakness he would bring
[1:14:46] Glory there would be a the right thing
[1:14:49] it would be the right sound coming out
[1:14:51] of her life and it would have such a
[1:14:53] Rippling effect through eternity that
[1:14:56] that widow woman would be talked about
[1:14:58] would be the would be the the signpost
[1:15:01] in that synagogue that day when he was
[1:15:03] changing from Jewish dispensation to
[1:15:06] Gentile dispensation and he was bringing
[1:15:08] out what was happening that no prophets
[1:15:10] would be received no Prophet would be
[1:15:12] received in his own country and then he
[1:15:14] uses that widow woman out of all the
[1:15:18] stories he could have talked about David
[1:15:20] he could have talked about Moses he
[1:15:22] could have used the prophets of old he
[1:15:24] could have used all these people but he
[1:15:25] used the widow woman you think it was a
[1:15:29] mistake that she ended up in the
[1:15:30] condition she was in but do you let me
[1:15:33] just remind you my brother and sister
[1:15:34] God allowed her to come to that place he
[1:15:38] orchestrated her life the footsteps of
[1:15:40] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[1:15:43] plain and simple he allowed her to come
[1:15:46] to that place he knew the tears she she
[1:15:48] cried over her husband he knew the the
[1:15:51] suffering she went through but he was
[1:15:53] there all the time
[1:15:55] she might have felt alone she might have
[1:15:57] felt like God doesn't hear me God we're
[1:15:59] supposed to receive a prophet we're
[1:16:01] supposed to receive Deliverance where is
[1:16:03] the god of Israel he was there all the
[1:16:06] time he was orchestrating governments he
[1:16:09] allowed the he allowed the the the the
[1:16:11] Jezebel to to uh to put pressure on the
[1:16:15] prophet amen he allowed all these things
[1:16:17] to
[1:16:20] happen I want to say
[1:16:22] something so he didn't really need the
[1:16:26] widow woman in this light let me say it
[1:16:28] like this he just the Elijah the prophet
[1:16:32] was just being fed right he was in he
[1:16:34] was in this nice Oasis he had just run
[1:16:37] away from Jezebel the Lord picks him up
[1:16:39] what are you doing here right and he
[1:16:41] puts him in this nice Oasis and he has
[1:16:43] Ravens feeding
[1:16:45] him I mean what is he trying to say I
[1:16:48] can do
[1:16:50] anything the way I choose to feed you is
[1:16:55] my choosing the way I choose to take
[1:16:57] care of you is my choosing I I am God
[1:17:00] Amen I created all things right all
[1:17:04] things were created by Him and catch
[1:17:06] this next portion for
[1:17:08] him everything was made for him those r
[1:17:12] Ravens were made for him to use to feed
[1:17:15] the prophet amen that Prophet was made
[1:17:18] for him everything that we see my
[1:17:21] brother and sister the people you see
[1:17:22] here in this room today are made for God
[1:17:25] your life was made for God everything
[1:17:28] about you is for
[1:17:30] God so he cares about your life but what
[1:17:34] am I saying here he is he's he's he's
[1:17:36] got him in this perfect scenario this
[1:17:38] perfect condition he's already feeding
[1:17:40] him he's he's got this nice Rippling
[1:17:42] Brook that comes by and the Cool Breeze
[1:17:45] and it's so lovely and and so nice and
[1:17:48] then God shows up and stops up the water
[1:17:51] and stops the
[1:17:52] Ravens uh by the way I have a widow a
[1:17:55] woman for you
[1:17:58] I I I believe the Lord fed him with
[1:18:01] Ravens and had that little riing book
[1:18:03] there by chth right I believe he had
[1:18:06] those things to prove to us he didn't
[1:18:08] need the widow woman right he can do
[1:18:10] whatever he wants but there was a
[1:18:13] purpose there was a reason that he
[1:18:16] needed the widow woman it wouldn't be a
[1:18:19] a bird from the sky it would be a woman
[1:18:22] who is in this flesh who is dealing with
[1:18:24] weaknesses and reasonings and doubts and
[1:18:27] fears he chose a widow woman to do the
[1:18:30] same thing that he can do in the
[1:18:33] Supernatural she's as good as those
[1:18:37] Ravens but now he said I have commanded
[1:18:40] her that's what he
[1:18:43] said oh my I love the scriptures
[1:18:47] huh he said I have commanded her have
[1:18:50] past tense I've commanded this wiow
[1:18:51] woman to sustain you Elijah
[1:18:56] where in the scriptures do we find God
[1:18:59] talking to the widow
[1:19:01] woman if anybody knows of a place please
[1:19:04] let me know because I have looked
[1:19:06] there's nowhere in the
[1:19:09] scripture right where God speaks to the
[1:19:12] widow woman and commands her tells her
[1:19:16] to feed
[1:19:18] Elijah to sustain Elijah that's a pretty
[1:19:21] big deal right this is like life life
[1:19:25] changing this is life altering this is
[1:19:29] this is going into the supernatural
[1:19:31] realm you would think that you know in a
[1:19:33] business if there was a big move taking
[1:19:35] place or or you know you're going to
[1:19:37] change policies or something you have a
[1:19:38] meeting and everybody gets the memo
[1:19:41] right and it's well explained well laid
[1:19:44] out there's something about the way God
[1:19:47] operates that he does not need to send
[1:19:49] us memos and he does not have to explain
[1:19:51] everything to us why because there's
[1:19:53] something in US
[1:19:55] that is him that knows what to do at the
[1:19:59] right time this bride will know what to
[1:20:01] do with the word amen the prophet said
[1:20:04] it she'll know what to do with the
[1:20:07] word now the prophet never explained to
[1:20:10] us what that means what
[1:20:13] word there's something in us it's
[1:20:16] pre-written it's written in the fleshly
[1:20:18] tables of our hearts we might not have
[1:20:21] heard an audible voice we're like that
[1:20:23] Rahab amen we might not have have heard
[1:20:26] an audible voice we might not have been
[1:20:27] there in the healing lines we might not
[1:20:29] have been there when he was preaching
[1:20:31] those things but yet nonetheless there's
[1:20:33] something in us that causes us to press
[1:20:36] on causes us to believe like we heard
[1:20:38] last night causes us to press through
[1:20:41] and we can't explain it I can't explain
[1:20:44] why why some leave the message and some
[1:20:47] stay but it does cause me to go back to
[1:20:50] the scriptures and find out where do
[1:20:52] these things happen
[1:20:59] oh my she was commanded which means
[1:21:05] ordered it was it was like a a
[1:21:08] commission and yet there was no record
[1:21:11] of God speaking to her that we know of
[1:21:15] we're going to see that record one day
[1:21:16] because it's all written in eternity her
[1:21:19] whole life was mapped out by God the
[1:21:21] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:21:23] of the Lord and he told Elijah the
[1:21:25] prophet he said go to her because I have
[1:21:27] commanded her I have commanded her and
[1:21:31] here when we if we could just turn the
[1:21:33] camera over to this widow woman as God
[1:21:35] is speaking the widow woman is over here
[1:21:38] in her front yard digging through the
[1:21:40] the the dust she's picking up two sticks
[1:21:44] you know what the prophet says you know
[1:21:46] he says those two sticks represents the
[1:21:48] cross we know that part so well what we
[1:21:49] don't always read is that he says those
[1:21:52] two sticks used to be a big
[1:21:55] tree she comes out into her yard and
[1:21:58] there with that nice big tree maybe it
[1:22:00] was a fruit tree maybe it was a tree
[1:22:02] that used to give shelter maybe maybe it
[1:22:04] it would bring a nice shade in the in
[1:22:06] the hot summer days and you know there
[1:22:08] was a a tree there was a nice big tree
[1:22:10] in her yard but conditions had gone so
[1:22:13] bad that there was two little sticks
[1:22:14] left over from this
[1:22:16] tree I mean you tell me how bad
[1:22:19] conditions have to get where a tree
[1:22:20] would perish and it would become two
[1:22:22] little sticks
[1:22:25] so it was bad and she was she was there
[1:22:28] in her yard she's thinking about her son
[1:22:30] she's making she's going to make a
[1:22:32] little fire she's got just enough food
[1:22:34] she's been rationing I can just see her
[1:22:36] maybe 30 days ago she was planning this
[1:22:39] day she knew that I've got about 30
[1:22:42] pieces of of meal left I've got about 30
[1:22:45] days worth of oil left I've got just
[1:22:47] enough and I cannot see past
[1:22:51] that why because we have been given a
[1:22:54] number of days to live she could not see
[1:22:57] past those number of days what is the
[1:23:00] mystery beyond that there's does my life
[1:23:02] end is this really what it's all about
[1:23:05] am I going to reach the end of my
[1:23:06] existence and that's just it's all over
[1:23:08] it's
[1:23:09] done I have commanded a w a woman that's
[1:23:13] ringing out in eternities and that that
[1:23:16] word is going to find that woman but
[1:23:19] here I want to show you the carnal the
[1:23:21] carnal environment that she's in the
[1:23:23] carnal atmosphere that she finds herself
[1:23:25] in is a one of of dreariness of
[1:23:28] weariness of tiredness just this day in
[1:23:31] day out just watching carefully over
[1:23:34] those little bits of meal and and
[1:23:36] protecting it and and watching over it
[1:23:38] and making sure that that nobody comes
[1:23:40] in to steal it you know she's just and
[1:23:42] then she's wondering what is God going
[1:23:44] to do and what are the number of my days
[1:23:46] and and looking after all these things
[1:23:48] and day and day out going to church in
[1:23:50] the synagogues looking for something
[1:23:53] real right and here she comes and and in
[1:23:56] the meantime there's a prophecy hanging
[1:23:58] over her head there's a a virtue there's
[1:24:02] a a resilience there's a strength that
[1:24:04] she has not tapped into yet but God has
[1:24:08] already
[1:24:10] spoken God chose
[1:24:13] her and she might not have heard she
[1:24:16] might not have known she cannot explain
[1:24:19] that but she's just going through her
[1:24:20] everyday existence and it was miserable
[1:24:22] at best
[1:24:25] until one day she's in a in her front
[1:24:27] yard huh now I want to ask you a
[1:24:30] question how did how did Elijah know
[1:24:34] which widow woman it would
[1:24:37] be CU it had to be that one the one with
[1:24:40] the two sticks the one with the last
[1:24:42] morsal of meal he could have picked a
[1:24:45] better one just to increase his
[1:24:47] odds right he could have maybe somebody
[1:24:50] who was wealthy he could have chosen a
[1:24:52] wealthy W widow woman but he didn't he
[1:24:54] came to this one and the Bible clearly
[1:24:56] lays out how poor and how fragile her
[1:24:59] existence was without God's word without
[1:25:03] God's vision of her without God in her
[1:25:07] uh uh plan and without God in her life
[1:25:10] my brother and sister she would have
[1:25:12] perished like all or maybe like some of
[1:25:16] the Widow
[1:25:17] women but she had a
[1:25:20] promise so the prophet comes to her
[1:25:22] house how did he get there how did he
[1:25:25] you know that's why I love the uh the
[1:25:27] the Insight the prophet brings in our
[1:25:29] day how did how did he know where this
[1:25:31] wiow woman
[1:25:33] was you know she didn't have a sign up
[1:25:35] on her door uh if any Prophet is passing
[1:25:38] by here specifically by the name of
[1:25:40] Elijah God told me that I'm going to
[1:25:42] sustain you that's not how this worked
[1:25:45] she had no idea and Elijah he was just
[1:25:49] said he was just told a certain city a
[1:25:50] certain location there's a widow woman
[1:25:53] there that will sustain you does not
[1:25:54] give the name okay so how did he know
[1:25:57] brother brandham tells us that he saw
[1:25:59] her in a
[1:26:01] vision in other words there there's this
[1:26:04] parallel kind of existence and this is
[1:26:07] to me what is so important that there's
[1:26:10] a written portion of your life the
[1:26:12] mystery of your life is hanging over top
[1:26:14] of you all the time we hear from our
[1:26:16] theophany amen our theophany is what
[1:26:19] tells us what kind of Faith to have and
[1:26:21] what to say and and and it's the Deep
[1:26:23] calling to a deep there's something that
[1:26:25] is just right here there's a like
[1:26:27] another existence I I don't know how to
[1:26:29] explain it so just bear with me but
[1:26:32] there's a truth about you that is
[1:26:35] playing out at the exact same time am
[1:26:38] there's a vision of you amen there's
[1:26:41] there's a portion of of you that is
[1:26:43] already
[1:26:44] pre-written God's plan for your life
[1:26:47] predestinated Justified Sanctified
[1:26:53] glorified right right it's fixed the
[1:26:56] destination is fixed everything is
[1:26:58] playing out and yet we are in this
[1:27:00] carnal side also where we we have been
[1:27:04] given a
[1:27:05] body we've been given this body to do
[1:27:09] what it has a purpose
[1:27:12] to
[1:27:13] contact this
[1:27:15] Dimension and it does a great job we've
[1:27:18] been fearfully wonderfully made and it's
[1:27:20] been made to contact and everything we
[1:27:23] see around us wherever we go my brother
[1:27:26] and sister whatever it is whether it be
[1:27:27] a tree whether it be a mountain whether
[1:27:29] it be your mother at home whatever it is
[1:27:32] all the visible things declare the
[1:27:37] invisible and then he gives us another
[1:27:40] sense like we heard last night called
[1:27:42] the faith sense to contact the other
[1:27:47] world because it's more
[1:27:50] real it's fixed it's pre-written
[1:27:56] do you know uh we are now living in
[1:27:57] Heavenly places right
[1:27:59] now right even though we are sitting in
[1:28:02] this building we are actually in another
[1:28:04] atmosphere we are eagles amen and Eagles
[1:28:08] are designed to do what change from one
[1:28:10] dwelling place to another specifically
[1:28:13] higher they are they are given the
[1:28:15] strength the power to go and change
[1:28:17] their Dwelling Place amen so we've been
[1:28:21] given the strength to change our
[1:28:22] dwelling place we while we are pilgrims
[1:28:25] and strangers in this world Paul said
[1:28:27] you know the life I now live is not my
[1:28:29] own he recognized something something
[1:28:31] else is playing out in his life the life
[1:28:33] I'm living the life I that I'm uh uh the
[1:28:36] the things I do the the places I go it's
[1:28:39] not just me doing these things but it is
[1:28:41] Christ who lives in
[1:28:44] me he recognized something else is
[1:28:47] holding him something else is keeping
[1:28:49] him when he should have fallen something
[1:28:51] picked him
[1:28:52] up when he should have made him mistake
[1:28:54] there was something to lift him up
[1:28:59] amen I'm so way off my notes forgive
[1:29:03] me but we we're kind of in this dual
[1:29:07] kind of existence and we get to
[1:29:10] choose which one we want to emphasize
[1:29:13] you can choose the fear you can choose
[1:29:14] the doubt or you can choose what he has
[1:29:16] done for you you can choose who you are
[1:29:18] in Christ that we are now in Heavenly
[1:29:21] places you know when you go to work you
[1:29:24] know the next day you go to work I'm not
[1:29:25] sure if that's Monday Tuesday whichever
[1:29:27] day it is but if when you go to work
[1:29:29] again you're not just going to work but
[1:29:32] all of Heaven is around you there's the
[1:29:34] supernatural realm is all around you and
[1:29:36] my question to you is what testimony has
[1:29:39] he commanded from
[1:29:42] you take a an afternoon and go pray
[1:29:45] about that what testimony has he
[1:29:48] commanded from your life brother Chris I
[1:29:51] haven't heard a word from God neither
[1:29:53] did this with a woman but it did not
[1:29:55] matter because he has already spoken
[1:29:57] regarding her it's already as good as
[1:30:01] done what testimony has he commanded
[1:30:04] from
[1:30:05] you because it will come to pass you'll
[1:30:09] get to Monday and and you might feel you
[1:30:11] might feel what am I doing at work I got
[1:30:14] to deal with these people I got to do
[1:30:15] this no there's something about you he's
[1:30:18] watching you he's making sure you're
[1:30:20] going to be in the right position at the
[1:30:22] right at the right time why because you
[1:30:24] are the sustaining element to his
[1:30:28] word that's a little heavy it's a little
[1:30:31] heavy but we sustain the
[1:30:35] word what is it he said I'm just telling
[1:30:38] you what the scripture says amen it's I
[1:30:39] know it's hard for me also to grasp but
[1:30:42] but think about that you are the
[1:30:44] sustaining portion to the
[1:30:48] prophet what good is the prophet who has
[1:30:51] the secrets of God's heart has the has
[1:30:54] the Mysteries that are going to come
[1:30:56] through him if there's not a person to
[1:30:58] reveal it
[1:30:59] to if there's not a p if he's bringing a
[1:31:03] message to connect you to
[1:31:07] God right now we could we could play
[1:31:10] this game of of looking at at the story
[1:31:12] of the widow
[1:31:13] woman and we could say well who's
[1:31:15] sustaining who because God said I have
[1:31:19] commanded a wow woman to sustain you
[1:31:22] right so here's a wiow woman she's is
[1:31:24] going to have the ability to do the
[1:31:25] right thing to say the right thing react
[1:31:28] the right way respond the right way
[1:31:29] she's going to have the ability to
[1:31:32] sustain the prophet based on the word of
[1:31:35] God right but then the prophet has to be
[1:31:38] the one that's on the scene he has to be
[1:31:40] there to make that contact because he's
[1:31:42] the revealer of the secrets of God she
[1:31:45] was a secret in that land of widows
[1:31:48] there was a secret concerning her she
[1:31:50] was the chosen one to sustain the pro
[1:31:54] so we have the Prophet come on the scene
[1:31:56] and yet it's God who has orchestrated
[1:31:58] all this he's the one who said I
[1:31:59] commanded so who's sustaining
[1:32:02] who it's all connected amen I mean you
[1:32:05] could argue it all three ways it is it
[1:32:08] is beautiful how it's how God writes his
[1:32:11] word how he how he plans it out we like
[1:32:14] I said it's hard to figure out where the
[1:32:15] lines are Where's the Line begin where
[1:32:18] the widow woman is actually the one
[1:32:19] sustaining isn't it God who said she
[1:32:21] would do that isn't it the power of his
[1:32:24] word through her that is causing her the
[1:32:26] ability to sustain but then without her
[1:32:29] God wouldn't be able to sustain
[1:32:31] Elijah do you see what I'm saying so we
[1:32:34] are so intricately intertwined in God's
[1:32:37] plan in his
[1:32:39] mind and each and every one of you have
[1:32:41] such an important part to play you might
[1:32:44] say well I'm just surviving yeah so was
[1:32:47] she she was so was she I'm not a
[1:32:49] Preacher Brother Chris I'm not I'm not
[1:32:51] anybody important so was she
[1:32:54] she doesn't even have a name but you can
[1:32:56] put your name there
[1:33:07] today commanded her to sustain
[1:33:12] you she was living in another
[1:33:16] atmosphere I find it amazing how this
[1:33:19] woman reacted to the to the prophet
[1:33:24] she you know it's it's amazing when you
[1:33:27] when you see a um a son or daughter of
[1:33:30] God the way they respond to
[1:33:33] situations is there's something about
[1:33:35] her
[1:33:36] character right there's something about
[1:33:38] her she she goes beyond the
[1:33:42] normal and yet she it wasn't explained
[1:33:44] to her this is to me such a comfort
[1:33:47] because the whole message wasn't
[1:33:48] explained to her but she was already
[1:33:52] designed she was already created in such
[1:33:55] a way to receive the
[1:33:57] word she would respond the right way in
[1:34:00] her
[1:34:01] flesh in this carnal thing she would
[1:34:05] respond the right
[1:34:07] way there's something in us that that
[1:34:09] holds us in our times of trial and
[1:34:12] distress when we want to break you know
[1:34:14] that last that last little step right
[1:34:17] where you feel like I'm going to break
[1:34:19] this it's too
[1:34:21] much it's when you hear that voice
[1:34:24] is when somebody comes on the scene
[1:34:26] somebody sends you a text the Lord knows
[1:34:28] exactly where those limits
[1:34:32] are so he comes to her we know the story
[1:34:35] well I I might as well finish the story
[1:34:37] of the widow woman he comes to her and
[1:34:39] he asks for her to give him water now
[1:34:43] there a time of drought right it's a
[1:34:46] time of drought but it's it's amazing
[1:34:48] you know water is something that that is
[1:34:50] is not it's not very um kind of like
[1:34:53] it's just kind of like everybody has
[1:34:55] this you know water is something that
[1:34:57] everybody would have access to you know
[1:34:58] in a time of in a time of droughts and
[1:35:00] famines and stuff the major thing that
[1:35:03] they pump into those places is water
[1:35:05] right they make sure everybody has water
[1:35:07] it's the last resource it's the most
[1:35:08] important thing right so he asks
[1:35:11] something of her that is that is
[1:35:14] something that she could give she
[1:35:15] doesn't we don't see her uh thinking
[1:35:18] about it we don't see her uh you know
[1:35:20] being negative we don't see her kind of
[1:35:23] like uh worried or anything like that
[1:35:24] she just turns and gets goes to get the
[1:35:27] water right she just responds right away
[1:35:30] that's something I can do absolutely
[1:35:32] that's something I have right so I'm
[1:35:35] going to give you that and then and then
[1:35:38] and and at this point it hasn't it's not
[1:35:40] really affecting her and her son so what
[1:35:42] he's asking of her this is still easy
[1:35:46] you know he's a gentleman he's he's just
[1:35:49] slowly breaking in because he's already
[1:35:50] seen the vision this Prophet knows the
[1:35:53] SEC secret about this woman right he's
[1:35:56] not afraid to ask her you know because
[1:35:57] that would be a cruel thing to go into
[1:35:59] somebody's home in a season of drought
[1:36:02] and uh just can you please give me your
[1:36:05] food who here in their right mind would
[1:36:07] do that um I am a provider for my house
[1:36:11] my family you know I'm going to defend
[1:36:13] my
[1:36:14] resources something else was happening
[1:36:17] There's Something About This widow woman
[1:36:19] that was
[1:36:20] pre-written right that would react not
[1:36:23] like the other widow woman would have
[1:36:25] reacted they would have acted reacted
[1:36:27] very differently but she reacts the
[1:36:30] right way according to what was in the
[1:36:32] mind of God so she goes to get the water
[1:36:36] and then he says oh can you can you
[1:36:38] first go and and and bake me a cake
[1:36:41] right and we see through this dialogue
[1:36:44] it gets harder and harder what he asks
[1:36:46] her to do becomes harder and harder so
[1:36:50] much so that now he he he asks and he
[1:36:53] says say bake me a cake first I mean
[1:36:56] it's not like you know like just bring
[1:36:59] me some meal or some water it'll be
[1:37:01] that'll suffice you know I've been fed
[1:37:03] from Ravens for the last you know so
[1:37:05] many days weeks and and I mean I'm
[1:37:07] feeling pretty good but please bring me
[1:37:08] some water and now bring me a uh some
[1:37:10] meal and now just while you're at it
[1:37:13] just bake me a cake
[1:37:16] first
[1:37:19] first so everything she had everything
[1:37:23] all her resources she had to give it to
[1:37:26] the prophet first and you might say well
[1:37:29] that is everything well so was the
[1:37:32] little Loaves and Fishes it was all he
[1:37:34] had but in the right hands you see what
[1:37:36] I'm saying in the right hands there's a
[1:37:39] supernatural atmosphere also there's a
[1:37:42] supernatural God that is on the scene
[1:37:44] that has pre-written the story and he
[1:37:46] knows how it's going to play out and
[1:37:47] he's going to bring the virtue the
[1:37:48] strength the faith he's going to bring
[1:37:50] all the right
[1:37:51] ingredients he's going to bring us sweep
[1:37:53] over the bride amen how are we going to
[1:37:56] go into a Rapture well it's
[1:37:58] pre-written it's been it's already
[1:38:00] played out amen the vision we've seen
[1:38:02] the vision the prophet has shown us the
[1:38:04] vision that he saw the bride marching
[1:38:06] into the Rapture amen but there comes a
[1:38:08] season when all these things come
[1:38:10] together and he brings the supernatural
[1:38:13] elements all we have to do is keep
[1:38:15] moving
[1:38:16] forward keep believing keep
[1:38:19] trusting and so what is what does he do
[1:38:21] he he says bring me a cake
[1:38:24] first I I think it's just perfect a
[1:38:28] cake right in in my head I'm thinking a
[1:38:31] nice cake you know
[1:38:32] it's bring me something nice something
[1:38:35] amazing something
[1:38:38] refreshing right and at this point she
[1:38:40] turns and she says if I do this my son
[1:38:43] and I will die she now she now lays out
[1:38:47] the predicament she's in right and he
[1:38:52] said nonetheless go go do this to me
[1:38:55] this is this is so important what would
[1:38:59] we
[1:39:01] do well we know what we would do if
[1:39:03] we're in Christ amen by
[1:39:06] faith but what would we do you know when
[1:39:09] hardships come our way or somebody
[1:39:11] doesn't treat us the right way or or
[1:39:13] there's trouble in the church we want to
[1:39:16] react so
[1:39:17] quickly it is it is so much better to
[1:39:20] just find a quiet space give yourself a
[1:39:22] week give yourself a month give yourself
[1:39:24] some time and say Lord what is your will
[1:39:27] that is playing out in this what is what
[1:39:30] is what does the the writing say what do
[1:39:34] the Scrolls say about what I'm supposed
[1:39:37] to do here because I don't want to just
[1:39:39] react from a carnal position I don't
[1:39:42] want to react from a carnal atmosphere
[1:39:45] but I want to be in the heavenlies and
[1:39:48] and if I if I can just see that I'm in
[1:39:50] your will then it doesn't matter what
[1:39:52] happens
[1:39:53] it'll play out exactly according to your
[1:39:55] will and I want to be what you've
[1:39:57] written of
[1:39:59] me because it will have an eternal
[1:40:02] effect it'll have long lasting effects
[1:40:04] but if you take control and say I'm
[1:40:06] going to manage this I'm going to take
[1:40:08] care of this I'm going to deal with this
[1:40:11] I'm GNA fix
[1:40:13] this you'll make a
[1:40:15] mess just look at Jonathan and and Saul
[1:40:18] on the hill to me that is such a
[1:40:20] beautiful beautiful scene and it should
[1:40:22] be a scene that we um remember that we
[1:40:26] keep in the forefronts of our minds
[1:40:28] there's something about
[1:40:31] Jonathan the quality in Jonathan the
[1:40:34] Integrity of Jonathan and Jonathan they
[1:40:37] they we know the story they go up on
[1:40:38] that hill this is the this is a losing
[1:40:42] side that the whole battle is turned
[1:40:43] against them they are they're going to
[1:40:45] be defeated and and yet we find Jonathan
[1:40:47] and soul dying together so much so that
[1:40:50] David we know who David is amen he he
[1:40:53] looks at this scene and and he said but
[1:40:56] he says in the end they were not
[1:40:59] divided there something that he saw and
[1:41:03] this picture now and like I say it's
[1:41:05] easy to say that but you've got to
[1:41:06] really pay attention to who's lying on
[1:41:08] the
[1:41:09] hill there is Saul who's been rejected
[1:41:12] by God because there's a change of
[1:41:15] administration coming amen he's just he
[1:41:18] has not discarded him but he has he has
[1:41:20] ended his administration and because we
[1:41:23] know Saul will be there that day amen
[1:41:26] and so but Jonathan now Jonathan look at
[1:41:28] who Jonathan is he's supposed to be the
[1:41:30] prince who's going to be king in his
[1:41:33] father's stead but this poor man you
[1:41:37] know he's been so mistreated he's been
[1:41:39] made fun of by his own father he's been
[1:41:42] ridiculed in front of his men by his own
[1:41:44] father and yet Jonathan recognizes that
[1:41:48] God has chosen
[1:41:50] David but he doesn't go against his
[1:41:52] father
[1:41:54] this to me it it it goes beyond carnal
[1:41:56] abilities goes beyond carnal things and
[1:42:00] and the things we would we would do in
[1:42:02] Jonathan's position my church is this
[1:42:04] way and my pastor is that way or my mom
[1:42:07] and dad is a certain way so I'm going to
[1:42:10] go against them I'm going to fix this
[1:42:13] because they are wrong my brother and
[1:42:15] sister it's amazing how how Jonathan
[1:42:17] managed to keep his Integrity in the
[1:42:19] face of confusion in the face of
[1:42:21] ridicule in the face of of
[1:42:23] misunderstandings he managed to stay in
[1:42:26] the place that God called him to
[1:42:29] stay what about you as the bride of
[1:42:33] Christ when things get hard things go
[1:42:35] rough and we go through hard times in
[1:42:37] our churches and there's divisions and
[1:42:39] there's hard feelings but what about you
[1:42:41] what are you going to do in the time
[1:42:43] like that are you going to stand in your
[1:42:44] position and have some
[1:42:47] Integrity or you going to take things
[1:42:49] into your own
[1:42:51] hands my brother and sisters a important
[1:42:54] thing and it and it really for me the
[1:42:57] the lesson to learn from Jonathan is is
[1:43:00] where was he
[1:43:02] living where was Jonathan living was he
[1:43:05] living on that Hill next to his father
[1:43:08] with all the the shame and the failures
[1:43:11] and the things falling apart what looked
[1:43:12] like was falling apart was he was he
[1:43:15] looking at those things or was he
[1:43:17] looking at what God was going to do
[1:43:19] through
[1:43:20] David the purpose of God's plan for his
[1:43:23] life was he looking at a promise that he
[1:43:26] made in secret with
[1:43:29] David that if I oh if you become
[1:43:34] king he knew he was going to become king
[1:43:36] he was literally going to take his
[1:43:40] place the place that he should have had
[1:43:43] the that kingship belonged to Jonathan
[1:43:47] Jonathan would have had the resources
[1:43:48] the ability to defend his family he
[1:43:51] would have had been able to fight but it
[1:43:52] was not not God's will for
[1:43:55] Jonathan God's will for Jonathan was to
[1:43:59] die next to his
[1:44:03] father and yet David can look at that
[1:44:06] scene and say in the end they were not
[1:44:08] divided I think that picture is so much
[1:44:11] bigger than just two Eagles dying on a
[1:44:14] hill but it was foretelling Christ on a
[1:44:18] cross the the whole story had Rippling
[1:44:21] effects God looking at JN an and he and
[1:44:24] there's the father who who has rejected
[1:44:27] him even and Jonathan dying next to him
[1:44:30] because that was his place he needed to
[1:44:33] be at his post of Duty in the face of
[1:44:36] confusion in the face of all these
[1:44:38] things he had to be a man of
[1:44:40] integrity a man who was walking alone
[1:44:43] with God it was not about the morals of
[1:44:45] the world it was not about the
[1:44:46] conditions around him it was about his
[1:44:48] calling it was about his place in the
[1:44:50] body of Christ
[1:44:55] but there was a secret Covenant between
[1:44:57] him and David there was a another thing
[1:45:01] that was
[1:45:02] happening there was something that has
[1:45:03] been pre-written that if I die David
[1:45:08] will you look after my
[1:45:11] family his death on that Hill bought his
[1:45:14] son a seat at the king's
[1:45:17] table you know and I wonder if we the
[1:45:20] way we react the way we respond
[1:45:24] if we buy a seat at the king's table
[1:45:27] with the way we
[1:45:29] act the way we respond to things the way
[1:45:32] we conduct our
[1:45:34] lives are we purchasing a seat at the
[1:45:37] table for our
[1:45:42] children people might not understand why
[1:45:45] you act a certain way they might reject
[1:45:47] you they might they might think you're a
[1:45:50] failure they might think you're this or
[1:45:52] that or why do you believe in a prophet
[1:45:54] they can say all manner of things but in
[1:45:56] the secret of our hearts we maintain our
[1:45:59] integrity we maintain our trust in the
[1:46:01] Lord we stay in our
[1:46:04] position why because there's a seat
[1:46:06] being
[1:46:10] purchased you know that's the purpose of
[1:46:12] the Bride right that's why there's the
[1:46:14] story of Esther that's why there the
[1:46:16] story of Ruth that's why there's a story
[1:46:18] of all the women that go through the
[1:46:21] scriptures it's about you
[1:46:24] standing in your place so that you can
[1:46:26] speak on behalf of your
[1:46:28] family but if you're not in your
[1:46:31] position how will you
[1:46:33] speak but see if we allow fear and
[1:46:37] carnality to overcome us that's exactly
[1:46:39] what the devil wants amen if we allow
[1:46:42] those things to overcome us it will
[1:46:44] distort our Behavior it'll be confusing
[1:46:46] our children will look and they won't
[1:46:48] understand right we have to maintain our
[1:46:52] position
[1:46:54] press on press forward keep believing
[1:46:57] keep trusting in the Lord there's a
[1:46:58] story written the the plan is you know
[1:47:03] it's so it's so important so much so
[1:47:05] that when the disciples came back to
[1:47:06] Jesus they did great Miracles they did
[1:47:08] great things in his
[1:47:09] name even Judas was there they did great
[1:47:13] things in his name because there is a
[1:47:16] there's a law that is attached to Faith
[1:47:20] amen it there's a law that if you
[1:47:23] believe these things will happen there's
[1:47:25] a law but that people can operate in
[1:47:28] those
[1:47:29] Realms but there was another realm Jesus
[1:47:31] was going to unveil and he says don't
[1:47:34] Rejoice just because demons are subject
[1:47:36] unto you don't just Rejoice because
[1:47:38] healings are taking place don't just
[1:47:39] Rejoice because of the signs Rejoice
[1:47:42] because of who you are Rejoice because
[1:47:44] your names are written in the Lamb's
[1:47:47] Book of Life it is written in
[1:47:50] him it's written in him
[1:47:55] I not sure why we went this direction
[1:47:58] this
[1:47:59] morning but you are so important in
[1:48:01] God's
[1:48:02] eyes you are so necessary and the things
[1:48:06] we go through in our lives my brother
[1:48:08] and sister they are necessary we don't
[1:48:10] we don't have to be afraid of them we
[1:48:12] don't have to worry about them we don't
[1:48:14] have to get anxious about them many are
[1:48:16] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:48:18] Lord delivers them out of them
[1:48:20] all so much so that he would pick up the
[1:48:22] widow woman story many hundreds of years
[1:48:25] later and why why does he do that maybe
[1:48:28] I should just shine a little bit of
[1:48:29] light on this before we
[1:48:31] close why does he do this why what is
[1:48:34] the connection between these
[1:48:38] stories he he's talking about a widow
[1:48:40] woman who had no resources and then he
[1:48:42] flips it around and he says and what
[1:48:44] about non who had
[1:48:46] resources but his resources could not
[1:48:49] help him either so even his resources in
[1:48:51] the carnal world he had position he had
[1:48:54] stature he had an army you could command
[1:48:57] he had military grade
[1:49:00] doctors and yet in all these things
[1:49:02] nobody could heal
[1:49:04] him he he was a commander of armies he
[1:49:07] was a man of position don't miss that he
[1:49:09] was an important man so on one side of
[1:49:11] the scale we have someone with no
[1:49:13] resources on the other side we have
[1:49:14] someone with resources that's that's not
[1:49:17] what it's about it's not about your
[1:49:19] position and status in this carnal realm
[1:49:21] it's about your positioning in Christ
[1:49:24] it's about the vision of the word that
[1:49:26] has been pre-written of
[1:49:30] you Hallelujah in non's story we also
[1:49:33] find a little
[1:49:34] lady oh it's so beautiful huh a little
[1:49:38] lady God needed a little lady whose
[1:49:42] country had to be invaded had to be
[1:49:44] attacked her parents destroyed in front
[1:49:47] of her she would have been U taken
[1:49:50] hostage we've seen what happened on
[1:49:52] October 7th the the the feelings the
[1:49:55] hatred the the atrocity the tragedy this
[1:50:00] is how they feel we just had uh two
[1:50:03] people from Israel staying in our home
[1:50:05] and and they're like ambassadors for
[1:50:06] Israel they the emissaries they want to
[1:50:09] awaken people to what's happening in
[1:50:10] Israel we had them staying in our home
[1:50:11] we got firsthand accounts of how this
[1:50:13] feels and what's going on and so we can
[1:50:16] see how these how these tragedies how
[1:50:17] they can affect us
[1:50:20] carnally carnally right but where are
[1:50:23] you living so this little girl where was
[1:50:26] she living really was she living in the
[1:50:29] Syrian Captain's home the enemy to her
[1:50:32] people this was not a nice story this is
[1:50:35] we we've got to get the little Sunday
[1:50:37] school story like idea out of our head
[1:50:39] this this was a a terrible time for
[1:50:43] Israelites it was an embarrassing time
[1:50:45] for Israelites it was she was in this
[1:50:48] home where where where she was literally
[1:50:50] forced to serve the the enemy of her
[1:50:53] people probably the man who orchestrated
[1:50:56] the demise of her family and she had to
[1:50:59] serve this man she had to she had to
[1:51:01] look after his wife and tend to her
[1:51:04] needs in the very House of her
[1:51:07] enemies now she was living in a carnal
[1:51:10] realm we can imagine she could have
[1:51:12] taken advantage of the situation she
[1:51:14] could have said oh I'm in his home and
[1:51:16] I'm close enough to him where maybe I
[1:51:19] could poison his food or I could bring
[1:51:21] demise to his house you see if she was
[1:51:23] living in a carnal environment this is
[1:51:26] where her mind would be Revenge hatred
[1:51:30] and what woe is me and where is the god
[1:51:33] of my people she could have been like
[1:51:35] this but she was not in despair we don't
[1:51:38] find this little girl moving around and
[1:51:41] discouraged but yet she is she is
[1:51:43] focused and she's patient she was a lady
[1:51:47] of
[1:51:49] Integrity even though she was done wrong
[1:51:51] too
[1:51:53] amen oh Lord help us have patience huh
[1:51:56] Lord help us have patience to let the
[1:51:59] scene evolve let the story play
[1:52:03] out but she was not living in a carnal
[1:52:06] environment she was not looking at the
[1:52:08] conditions around her she was not
[1:52:10] looking at the place she was living cuz
[1:52:12] she was living in another
[1:52:14] realm I believe that with all my heart
[1:52:17] because there's no way possible for
[1:52:20] someone to live in that environment and
[1:52:22] and do what she
[1:52:25] did so we find her in this home she is
[1:52:28] in the in this Captain's home and and
[1:52:30] you know what's amazing is is if she
[1:52:33] found out about the leprosy if she found
[1:52:35] out about this right that he was a leer
[1:52:39] it's she could use this to her Advantage
[1:52:42] I found the weak
[1:52:45] spot right I found a rumor I heard a
[1:52:49] rumor he he's got a sense
[1:52:53] he's got a secret something and start to
[1:52:56] spread that throughout the kingdom to
[1:52:59] for her Advantage right for her personal
[1:53:03] Advantage for Israel's Advantage I have
[1:53:06] found a secret I can I can use us to
[1:53:09] exploit him to to blackmail him I could
[1:53:12] you know she's she could have she could
[1:53:13] have really done some damage in Syria
[1:53:16] she could have but we don't find her
[1:53:19] doing this there's a bigger story
[1:53:22] playing
[1:53:23] out because Jesus was going to stand in
[1:53:27] the temple one day and use that man but
[1:53:30] remember behind that man was a woman who
[1:53:33] was living in the right kind of
[1:53:35] atmosphere right if you really go study
[1:53:39] the story out what what would cause that
[1:53:43] woman to direct the
[1:53:45] enemy of
[1:53:48] Israel to her Prophet who has the answer
[1:53:52] for his need right what would make a
[1:53:56] little
[1:53:57] girl right we saw some little girls
[1:53:59] singing on the platform this morning
[1:54:01] what would cause a little girl to have
[1:54:04] that kind of knowledge remember now the
[1:54:07] key is in what Jesus said no leper was
[1:54:12] healed so it's not like this little girl
[1:54:15] could sit around and go well the prophet
[1:54:17] healed this leper and he said if you say
[1:54:20] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:21] or if you lay hands on on the sick you
[1:54:23] shall recover there was none of this no
[1:54:26] leper was
[1:54:28] healed this is very important there was
[1:54:32] no there was no
[1:54:34] example right and yet her conditions are
[1:54:38] so dire so
[1:54:41] bad for her to do completely the
[1:54:44] opposite right how did she
[1:54:46] know if you if you answer that question
[1:54:49] you'll see where I'm going
[1:54:52] the Lord would have had to tell her in
[1:54:55] some un audible way would have had to
[1:54:58] tell her or show her by Vision this is
[1:55:02] how he's going to be
[1:55:04] healed how else would this little girl
[1:55:07] know to say oh if you were with the
[1:55:12] prophet in
[1:55:15] Samaria that's pretty specific for him
[1:55:19] to be with the prophet that that is in
[1:55:23] Samaria how does she know he was in
[1:55:24] Samaria how did he know that there was a
[1:55:27] pro how did she know there was a prophet
[1:55:28] there remember she was taken out from
[1:55:30] that
[1:55:31] land right how did she know these things
[1:55:34] and how did she know you would be
[1:55:38] healed uh can you give me one example
[1:55:41] right of where a leper's been healed
[1:55:43] this way give me 10 examples one examp
[1:55:46] one example would suffice but the Bible
[1:55:49] says no lepers amen right and in the
[1:55:54] Widow story it is no
[1:55:58] widows very interesting I've got you on
[1:56:01] the edge of your seats maybe we'll leave
[1:56:03] it till next
[1:56:05] year what is he saying what is he trying
[1:56:08] to tell
[1:56:15] us so I think he explains it in his own
[1:56:20] life the of
[1:56:23] Bethesda Jesus Christ walks on the scene
[1:56:27] into a place where there's many that
[1:56:30] needs healing many and he the prophet
[1:56:33] explains it like this he would step over
[1:56:37] the
[1:56:38] bodies he would walk
[1:56:40] past why
[1:56:42] because something was
[1:56:46] pre-written I do nothing Jesus said I do
[1:56:48] nothing unless the father reveals it to
[1:56:50] me first I'm just trying to shine a
[1:56:53] little light into what's in you greater
[1:56:56] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:56:57] the world like you cannot
[1:57:00] fail and even though people would have
[1:57:02] looked at him and said you should be
[1:57:04] doing this you should have done this you
[1:57:06] should heal this person this person's
[1:57:08] need was greater than that person
[1:57:10] there's always going to be voices trying
[1:57:12] to manipulate you trying to control you
[1:57:15] it's always going to be somebody trying
[1:57:17] to influence you for their benefit
[1:57:20] always it's that's just going to be part
[1:57:21] of our carnal existence and it's not all
[1:57:24] bad I'm not saying it's all bad some
[1:57:26] people are trying to encourage you
[1:57:27] trying there's count there's good
[1:57:29] there's count in the Council of many
[1:57:31] right there's there's good things also
[1:57:33] but the the key is is to be completely
[1:57:36] surrendered to the will of
[1:57:39] God so we find here Jesus Christ walking
[1:57:42] through the pul of Bethesda right and in
[1:57:44] and in every story we find water there's
[1:57:47] a connection between all these stories
[1:57:49] right the woman gave Elijah Water right
[1:57:52] and non had to go dip himself seven
[1:57:55] times in water and now here is Jesus
[1:57:58] Christ in the pool of Bethesda right
[1:58:00] it's the
[1:58:02] Waterway through the Waterway right we
[1:58:04] are baptized into a Heavenly Kingdom we
[1:58:07] are baptized into the body of Christ
[1:58:10] into Heavenly places amen so what does
[1:58:12] he say he he comes in he comes into the
[1:58:15] scene of the pool of Bethesda and he
[1:58:17] literally walks over to the one
[1:58:21] man one
[1:58:23] man and there's there's some beautiful
[1:58:26] language in the scripture here the Bible
[1:58:28] says that the Lord
[1:58:31] knew that he had been there many
[1:58:34] days how did he
[1:58:37] know he Prophet explains this to us he
[1:58:40] says he was walking according to the
[1:58:44] vision so we have the unwritten
[1:58:47] part right the unwritten the Unseen we
[1:58:51] have the
[1:58:52] scene we have celestial bodies we have
[1:58:55] terrestrial bodies and they all have
[1:58:57] their own glory amen that's what the
[1:59:00] scripture says but all things were
[1:59:01] created by Him for him so that we could
[1:59:04] recognize the Unseen things by the seen
[1:59:07] things amen so do you see what's
[1:59:10] happening so you've got these two things
[1:59:13] and and and the one are one is pointing
[1:59:15] at the
[1:59:16] other right it's a deep calling to a
[1:59:19] deep it's the the mystery of you right
[1:59:22] but we have this un this this unspoken
[1:59:24] this written part that is unspoken that
[1:59:27] we don't hear there's not an audible
[1:59:29] voice that we
[1:59:31] hear but it is fixed it's
[1:59:34] written amen it's written that's that's
[1:59:38] the the bride will know what to do with
[1:59:40] the word it's pre-written we we have a
[1:59:43] story concerning us we will go through a
[1:59:45] body change there will be a resurrection
[1:59:48] will be all these things it's
[1:59:50] pre-written Amen and your individ ual
[1:59:52] walks with the Lord are all also
[1:59:54] pre-written so we have this this
[1:59:58] heavenly realm that is the real you that
[2:00:00] is playing
[2:00:02] out amen if I could have like a screen
[2:00:05] today and it it would actually just
[2:00:08] mimic me just copy me exactly you know
[2:00:10] like if you put on your computer screen
[2:00:12] and you want to project it to another
[2:00:13] screen you can choose you can say I want
[2:00:15] to duplicate screen or extend it right
[2:00:18] and so but if you duplicate it then the
[2:00:21] the what you see here here on on in one
[2:00:24] form is exactly the same in that form
[2:00:27] over there right it might be a larger
[2:00:29] screen but it's the same picture right
[2:00:32] it's playing out exactly the
[2:00:38] same we are so
[2:00:40] connected to God to what he has thought
[2:00:44] of you to his plan you you cannot
[2:00:47] there's there's nothing if God before us
[2:00:49] who can be against us what can separate
[2:00:52] us from the love of God like like these
[2:00:54] are not poetic statements these are
[2:00:56] literal statements you cannot I he said
[2:01:00] I will lose none of
[2:01:02] mine all the father has given me will
[2:01:05] come to me
[2:01:06] will did anybody hear that Audible Voice
[2:01:10] but it's
[2:01:11] written and you are right now playing
[2:01:14] out the image of the invisible you are
[2:01:18] playing out right
[2:01:20] here and and and what I'm trying to say
[2:01:22] today and I'll close with
[2:01:24] this Jesus went to the pilipi esda he
[2:01:27] went to one man the the whole point of
[2:01:30] all this is even though the prophet is
[2:01:32] not received in his own country even
[2:01:34] though he was rejected in his synagogue
[2:01:36] do you know that that after this great
[2:01:38] preaching and and him picking out just
[2:01:40] the right scriptures because he knew a
[2:01:42] prophet would pick up these things later
[2:01:44] you know that all this this great
[2:01:45] Supernatural event the the the whole
[2:01:48] culmination of this was it's such a sad
[2:01:51] ending if you think about it but it says
[2:01:53] that there was not many miracles done
[2:01:57] because of their
[2:02:00] unbelief right this is the conditions
[2:02:03] but the point of the whole story is even
[2:02:06] though the conditions look so bad even
[2:02:09] though it looks like the vision terries
[2:02:11] even though it looks like it's it's
[2:02:13] about failure like Jonathan and Saul
[2:02:15] Jonathan and Saul is a great victory for
[2:02:18] MTH you just go ask him and and did they
[2:02:22] ever lose each other no they'll be
[2:02:24] reconnected again one day cuz there's
[2:02:26] another seat at another table because
[2:02:28] somebody else died that looked like a
[2:02:30] terrible condition but nothing could
[2:02:32] keep him in the grave why because it was
[2:02:34] pre-written I am the resurrection and
[2:02:36] the life if you put this body in the
[2:02:38] ground I will raise it up again if you
[2:02:40] destroy this Temple I will raise it up
[2:02:42] again you think he's going to fail no
[2:02:45] there wasn't a demon in hell that could
[2:02:47] keep him there there wasn't a Roman seal
[2:02:49] that could keep him in the grave because
[2:02:51] it was pre-written it was spoken you
[2:02:54] think those words will come back to him
[2:02:56] void what about your life the part that
[2:03:00] you are
[2:03:02] playing you will return to
[2:03:08] him but there's a story playing out in
[2:03:11] different
[2:03:13] layers and that's why the prophet says
[2:03:15] it's a theophany right that's calling
[2:03:18] unto us our theophany knows who we
[2:03:21] really are
[2:03:22] it's a deep calling to a deep I'm
[2:03:24] closing the musicians can
[2:03:25] come it's a deep calling to a deep
[2:03:28] there's a
[2:03:29] connection and in our in our daily walks
[2:03:32] really what is it what am I saying this
[2:03:34] morning I'm saying we see a lot with
[2:03:37] these carnal eyes but we don't live here
[2:03:42] we don't really live here right we don't
[2:03:45] live in these conditions to live here
[2:03:47] would mean that these conditions have an
[2:03:49] effect upon us that they influence us
[2:03:52] that they control us we don't live here
[2:03:55] we are strangers and pilgrims in a
[2:03:57] Strange Land seeking a city whose
[2:03:59] Builder and maker is God where is that
[2:04:02] City Abraham I don't know but I'm
[2:04:05] walking I feel it pulling it's my
[2:04:08] theophany calling me as a deep calling
[2:04:10] to a deep there's a mystery about my
[2:04:12] life I don't understand it and yet we
[2:04:14] find Abraham is is such an amazing Story
[2:04:17] how that God brings him all the way to
[2:04:19] this place where he stands right in
[2:04:20] front of God
[2:04:23] and he's asking for his
[2:04:25] family making intercession for his
[2:04:28] family we see this in Moses we see this
[2:04:30] in Jesus Christ himself we see this in
[2:04:32] Esther this is our role this is our
[2:04:35] purpose our story but look at the
[2:04:37] conditions of Abraham's life to get him
[2:04:39] to that
[2:04:41] place living in a different
[2:04:44] atmosphere we are living in a different
[2:04:46] atmosphere in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:04:49] Jesus brother Isaac if you'll close in a
[2:04:52] song God bless you I'm looking forward
[2:04:54] to the service
[2:05:03] tonight
[2:05:04] amen let's Stand
[2:05:07] Together Jesus walked into the pool of
[2:05:12] Bethesda and the Bible says that I knew
[2:05:15] he says Jesus saying I knew you have
[2:05:19] been here for many days
[2:05:23] whatever you're going through whatever
[2:05:26] part of life you're
[2:05:28] in just keep those words in the in the
[2:05:31] in in your
[2:05:32] mind he
[2:05:34] knows all the
[2:05:36] days he knew how many days he'd been
[2:05:40] laying there you know isn't it amazing
[2:05:42] while Jesus is doing all these other
[2:05:45] things and mirales and doing great feats
[2:05:48] in the back of his in the background
[2:05:51] there's a story playing out in this
[2:05:53] man's life in Beth in in Betha the PO of
[2:05:58] be Bethesda sorry this this man is is
[2:06:01] living out in agony and every day there
[2:06:05] every time this this the angel would
[2:06:07] move the waters trouble the waters
[2:06:10] somebody would push him out of the way
[2:06:11] or he would just be just too slow or you
[2:06:14] know it it just just didn't couldn't
[2:06:16] seem to get
[2:06:17] there there was something holding him
[2:06:20] back it was the
[2:06:23] word it wasn't see this is this is where
[2:06:25] we got to change our thinking it wasn't
[2:06:28] Calamity that's holding you back it's
[2:06:30] not your inabilities holding you back
[2:06:33] there's a
[2:06:34] promise God wants to come on the scene
[2:06:37] himself personally to you because he
[2:06:40] knows who you are and he knows where you
[2:06:42] are and he wants to come personally and
[2:06:44] deliver you from that thing but
[2:06:47] sometimes we will blame our conditions
[2:06:49] we will blame our church we will blame
[2:06:50] this no it's actually
[2:06:54] God oh man there's a you say God will
[2:06:58] allow evil to befall me is it evil when
[2:07:02] he says all things work together for
[2:07:04] good he puts bits in the mouth of
[2:07:08] trouble he controls it he tells her
[2:07:10] which way to turn amen nothing can
[2:07:14] happen to you unless he allows
[2:07:16] it no one can take your
[2:07:19] life oh my
[2:07:22] do we see who we
[2:07:23] are the devil can't touch you and
[2:07:27] everything that's happening to you is
[2:07:28] happening for a reason but for us in
[2:07:31] this we we we kind of approach life with
[2:07:35] a
[2:07:36] carnal understanding with with carnality
[2:07:41] and we try to understand it through
[2:07:43] carnal uh abilities and it's going to be
[2:07:47] miserable it'll be wearisome it'll be
[2:07:50] tires it it's it's not how we do things
[2:07:52] we do we do not walk by sight we walk by
[2:07:56] faith so whatever we're going through
[2:07:59] whatever you're going through you can
[2:08:01] you can you can just take a step back
[2:08:03] and say Lord I might not be able to get
[2:08:06] through those
[2:08:07] Waters but I know that every day I
[2:08:10] try you count
[2:08:13] it every day I rush and somebody pushes
[2:08:17] me aside every day I get up and I deal
[2:08:20] with this thing every day that I pray
[2:08:22] for my family every day that I I know
[2:08:24] that you are right
[2:08:27] there you are with
[2:08:30] me you are there in the room when I'm
[2:08:32] crying you are there when I'm lonely you
[2:08:34] are there in my school and my workplaces
[2:08:36] you are there every time I reach you are
[2:08:40] there but my brother and sister you can
[2:08:42] have faith in him Lord I know there'll
[2:08:44] come a day it'll be a certain day it
[2:08:48] will it will have run out the the the
[2:08:51] time that you have allotted for it and
[2:08:54] you hold all that you know he created
[2:08:57] time why would he create
[2:09:00] time he's a he's a being of Eternity why
[2:09:04] would he create
[2:09:06] time time wasn't made for us okay time
[2:09:11] was not made for us all things we got to
[2:09:14] stick to the scriptures amen all things
[2:09:16] were made by him for him so time was
[2:09:22] made for
[2:09:24] him so we're not behind we're not in a
[2:09:28] rush we're not it's all for him time is
[2:09:30] in his hands he's in control of the time
[2:09:34] he knows how many days he knows how many
[2:09:37] hours he knows this very
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:41] moment he created time because he knew
[2:09:43] that there would come a day be it 39
[2:09:47] days be it 39 months whatever the time
[2:09:50] sequence is
[2:09:51] the sixth hour the seventh day all the
[2:09:55] all the all those numbers in the Bible
[2:09:57] are to prove that he is the Divine
[2:09:59] architect it's so that we can measure
[2:10:02] him so that we can see how perfect on
[2:10:05] time God is every
[2:10:08] time and that we don't
[2:10:12] fail all things were created by Him for
[2:10:14] him your life my brother and sister is
[2:10:17] such a beautiful Symphony playing out to
[2:10:20] your savior he looked looks at your life
[2:10:22] and he says just hang on just one more
[2:10:23] day one more day I'm coming you are
[2:10:27] playing your part perfectly one more day
[2:10:30] remember Nebuchadnezzar without God he
[2:10:32] was just an animal he was just a beast
[2:10:35] even in the government world even out
[2:10:37] there as a king this enemy of Israel
[2:10:39] even he was controlled by God was made
[2:10:42] for god without God we're just a beast
[2:10:44] in the
[2:10:45] field an unrecognizable
[2:10:49] beast but here everything is playing out
[2:10:52] perfectly when he came to the pool of
[2:10:53] Bethesda he proved that he is God and he
[2:10:56] proved that that man belonged to
[2:10:59] him that he was his that he knew about
[2:11:03] him that to me is the most beautiful
[2:11:05] thing the Lord knows those who are his
[2:11:07] the whole point of the story is that the
[2:11:08] Lord knew there was a widow woman the
[2:11:10] Lord knew that there was a leper and the
[2:11:13] Lord knew that there was this man who
[2:11:15] was impotent
[2:11:17] man he knows about you but he also knows
[2:11:21] know the rest of your story so this
[2:11:24] today we can trust in him amen God bless
[2:11:27] you brother Isaac you'll sing a few
[2:11:28] songs brother
