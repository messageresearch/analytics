put together an agenda so waiting on them let's turn to if you've got your Bibles handy let's go to judges chapter eight and we're going to read down to verse 21 and then we're going to go to first Timothy yeah are we going we're going oh there we go um first ones always blank always forget that okay so judges chapter 8 17 I'm gonna read down to verse 21 now this is after just before we read this another speaking of Gideon and his and his son this is after they have defeated the Midianites and the children of the east then great victories have happened and now we come to this part of the part of the story so his so he says and he beat down this is Gideon and he beat down the tower of pinyon and slew the men of the city then said he unto a zipper and Zelda mana which so they have um what manner of men are though whom you slew at table so these men killed his family and they answered as thou art so are they each one resembled the child of a king and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother is a Lord liveth if he had saved him alive I would not slay you and he said unto death his firstborn up and slay them but the youth drew not a sword for he feared because he was yet a youth the in zipper and ends old mana have you say that he said rise now and fall upon us for as the manners so as a strength and Gideon rose and slew a zipper ends our mana and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks now let's go to first Timothy chapter 1 this may seem like kind of odd scripture readings but um I trust that the Lord will will bless his word this morning and let's just read this them or we'll have a word of Prayer but first Timothy chapter 1 and we're reading verses 16 and 18 16 to 18 now Peter Paul is writing to Timothy he sees how be it for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all along might show forth all long-suffering for a to them which would help I believe on him to life everlasting now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and glory forever and ever amen this H this charge I commit unto thee my son Timothy according to the prophecies which which went before on thee that they are bias them mightest war a good warfare amen no it's just about he's a word of Prayer we have any requests house house baby Liam he's on the mend okay praise the Lord this is price shall we gracious father we thank you Lord we can be gathered we can be assembled together one more time father - Lord not to see one another necessarily but Lord to see you father we want to ask is where you have opened the pages of your Bible Lord we know that father anyone can open it but Lord it takes you to make it live Lord to interpret your word - father I just ask that you would give us strength from your word may you open it to us Lord may the spirit of Revelation be here O Lord your Holy Spirit to quicken your word to our hearts father that we would leave your presence changed Lord

perfect health father and Lord we just ask that you would further everyone who's not here this morning may you be their portion father be their strength Lord and may you Lord just quicken us by your spirit father this morning Lord we just want to commit ourselves into your hands Lord we Lord as your prophet told us the greatest gift that anyone can have is to get themselves out of the way Lord that you can manifest yourself through that person and Lord as a congregation of people help us to all get ourselves out of the way Lord that you could manifest yourself in this meeting Lord or not just this at this moment but every day of our lives may you grab to feel glory we thank you for your Lord the cross of Calvary your blood that was shed follow by one offering we have been lured your perfected them forever that are sanctified thank you Lord for your great professor you've given for us and Lord we just commit the service into your hands Lord have your way father in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen amen god bless y'all you may be seated this morning I want to take a title if I could I want to speak on a new generation now not a younger generation but a new generation so because when we think of a young generation we think of age but really it's it's not an age of a person that's the age of a person in the Lord they can be a youth you can be 90 years old and still be a youth in God right so this is for I believe it was for all of us but we read here and judges chapter eight that here we have Gideon and and this is if you if you read the book of Judges this is after the great victory that he had over the children of the east and over Midian and and and and he dealt with some other people so great victories had happened in the family where where God came down in it and and where get in he a few chapters before this he asks a question where is the god of our fathers have brought us out of out of Egypt and and the very God that brought them out of Egypt was he was in a form of an older man sitting under an oak tree and speaking to Gideon when he was threshing the wheat there in secret and and God became real to him he wasn't a god of history anymore but he was a present God and it's the same thing with us you know he can't be a God of history to us he's got to be the present God he's the I am and so God used Gideon to defeat the enemies of Israel and they had a great deliverance there and so no doubt Gideon's son and as other sons were witnesses of these things they saw this happen in the family but now they're come to time with the younger generation now I say this is not just age you know physical age but this is in the Lord through the younger ones that come up they have to take their position they have to take their place where it's not it's not mum and dad's or or the song leader or the or the minister or the Sunday School teachers testimony but it becomes their testimony where they instead of coming up behind and the older ones are fighting in the battle on the front they pick up their sword and they join the ranks I mean within our just war him behind him and and trying to dodge the fire that's the enemy but they pick up the sword they pick up the shield they put on the helmet of salvation and the full armor of God and they and they and they join the ranks in the front hallelujah so now here was here was a perfect opportunity for Gideon son now because notice as we maybe would just put them back up again so the enemies that he was commanded to slay they were already defeated they had already been taken captive they had no weapon in their hand I meant it's just as look at the conditions just manners this young man is going to step to the front he's going to draw a sword hallelujah is that the enemy is defeated the enemy has no weapon the enemy has resigned himself to the fact as he said here he said then since it says in verse 2 anyone they say rise up rise down and fall upon us for as the man is so so as a strength so these men know they're going to die and they know they're going to die this day they've resigned you've been resigned to this fact now I'm trying to label this because the devil knows his numbers up I mean because it says in Revelations chapter 12 and maybe we'll just read that I don't have it in my notes but if we go to Revelation chapter 12 we will see that he knows his numbers up now you see with people sometimes when they know that they have lost they react in different ways some people they they just get sad and they accept the fact that they have lost the battle and they just resigned to their fate other people get angry that they've lost and the devil gets angry he's he's that kind of a kind of an enemy he just gets angry that he's lost its his here in revelations chapter 12 it says we'll just read from verse 7 I know I this is one of my favorite parts of the scripture amen but um well it's all favorite but I like this I like it when when you read about your victory and his defeat hallelujah as I like to read those kind of things and so from revelations 12 and verse 7 it says and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not and neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceives the whole world was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of us Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night now this is the day we're living in as the bride goes up Satan is cast down Alleluia and we know by the opening of the seven seals the prophet told us at that that it's not just because the seals are Christ being revealed we know that he says the seals are Christ but he also says it's the enemy being uncovered where all of us works down through the ages have been exposed so he can't hide in any place and he can't and he can't come in by deceit and in and in by us believing his lie then he can go up before God and say look they believe my life that that's how he becomes the accuser of the Brethren but because he's been exposed and we don't believe any of his life that's that that shuts his mouth because he has nothing against us that he can accuse God take to God and accuse God say God they've done this they've done this they've believed my lie here and they've done this all that's been struck off the prophet told us we never did it in the first place we justified the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't just cover our sin and annihilate so soon it cleanses us we have a clear deed hallelujah there's nothing held against us amen isn't that right that's what the blood does it doesn't just cover our sin and maybe be dealt with in a future event it's already dealt with a man it's as simple as a simple from your heart can facing God I'm wrong forgive me of my sin forgive me what I've done and that goes into the blood of Jesus Christ and the Prophet likens it to a tub of bleach we're ink ink being the sin falls into the bleach and you can't find the ink anymore it's broken up and done away with Alleluia I mean so that's how and so that's why the accuser he has nothing to he has no evidence anymore amen he goes up and says they did this they said this they thought this and God says where's and I can't find it it's not in my filing system and my filing system never gets a virus hallelujah it's always perfectly in order it doesn't need a defrag or whatever more it's already and and the evidence is gone olia and it says now it says in verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony now I just want to maybe remember we read about how he was called to draw a sword he had a weapon in his hand a sword now our testimony is us having evidence that his would works I mean that's our testimony I believe the Word of God it is faithful and true amen it applies to me I believe it myself and that's been your giving evidence that is Word is true that's your testimony so ever so they overcame him now this is you we have some overcoming you ever came him by the blood lame of the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them now we dwell in heavenly places rejoice all ye hallelujah ye heavens and ye that dwell on them you say but we're not in a heaven no but we're in heavenly places amen we're in heavenly places so just rejoice woe to the inhabitants of the earth and to the sea we say but we're on terra firma we may be these bodies may be but we live in a different kind of realm that's why we don't need to be afraid of the devil wandering around like a roaring lion woe to the inhabitants of the scene of the earth for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time see he's angry he noses his numbers up and he doesn't just go oh well too bad Noah gets angry about it you see a like yo like soccer hooligans and fans their team loses they get angry they burn cars they're right they whatever war he's angry that's just that in a minor form so but these men we're not that way they resign themselves to the fact that they had lost and they were going to die this day and so now but you see gideon wanted his son to take their lives because he wanted his son to know the victory is his i mean god wants us to realize we got to draw the sword draw the sword of the spirit which is the word of god we have to draw the sword amen and have confidence in our weapon but you see now he did not he did not because he was but a sea but the youth do not a sword for he feared because he was yet a youth he was looking at his own ability and the his fear can i do this job well well you have two enemies that are imprisoned they know they're going to die they're actually saying kill me amen and the devil he may be angry he may be roaring but he knows his numbers up he knows he knows he's done hallelujah he knows he's done because he knows his the people upon the earth whether you like to admit it or not he knows he's a bright upon the earth and sure all of hell may be here but all heaven is here also and heaven is always greater than the darkness Amen gross darkness may cover the people but this light hallelujah is the light of the word that's never been so bright as in this hour I mean all hell may be upon the earth but all heaven is here also hallelujah so we don't need to fear he freed drawing his sword to kill these captives we shouldn't fear or doesn't work has it worked before I mean has it worked before it'll work again the scan doesn't jam it doesn't rust it doesn't need maintenance in that way I mean this weapon works but you could have confidence the same sword Amen that worked in history works today hallelujah but he wants you to raise up take God at His Word thank God and his work doesn't just carry it round black hey he had a piano sheath he had a sword however he carried it I've got a sword look at me I've got a Bible he was walking around but he had to draw it one day but he was afraid he says but I'm by the youth but then but that's the problem he didn't look at where he was he didn't look who he was we we read there where Gideon asked these two what were these people like the manner of men of whom you a ball this is in the first verse here verse 17 and they answered as thou art as they were each one resembled the child of a king they were his family now that's that's what the enemy viewed these people is and this is what this youth was getting in son amen so but his son wasn't viewing himself in this way I'm but a youth I can't do this job he was ordained to do the job but he didn't he didn't draw a sword and he didn't take their lives he didn't stand up and have his own testimony that the Lord works that the word works now we read here and we read here in Timothy Paul is speaking to his spiritual son Timothy I commit this charge under the son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on me that thou mightest that by them might us war a good warfare now here we are and it's the same thing with us Timothy Timothy was a young man he says another place let no man despise thy youth but he had to know how to fight a good warfare and we have to know how to fight a good warfare also it's not enough see the enemy the greatest thing you can do in a war has a depth to what your enemy is doing great victories are one win when when you change your tactics to defeat what the enemy is doing if you just plow on with the same old thing you know you take you take the age of the musket with you Napoleon in those ones they just lined up in rows they had their muskets they stood there not really far from each other and they just fired shots at each other fixed bayonets and charged in and did all those things that didn't work in World War one because the warfare had evolved and they had to change their tactics and you the static world will one when they when they we're not going for the top of the trenches to to charge through no means let do you know the actually initially star just marching they actually just started marching because they're still trying to go out of napoleon's playbook and they just got mowed down by machine guns but they had to change what they are doing and it's the same thing with us now we may try something and we see the enemy as as working against us but if it doesn't work you were to change your tactic they meant you got to change your tactic it's like in a family trying to win over a loved one or or a child or something you see they're not responding the right way like you want them to respond you got to change your tactic you got to change how you relate to them how you speak to them how you deal with them amen because the devil's caning he studied you you've got to study him do you study your enemy it's like traps and snares the Bible speaks of traps and snares now I can put up a photo of a possum track or a trap for a stone or something and and you would look at that and you'd say there's nothing I'd say you know would that trap you and you look at it safe course not I don't want some egg in a trap you know I would never crawl into that thing to get some old rotten apple or pig's head or something but the reason is is because it's not made for you it's made for a possum or a stud or a pig or whatever it's not made for you so the devil doesn't put out something to you there's not appealing he puts out a trap that would entice you because he knows human nature amen he knows human nature and we will may be annoyed by something but because he is maybe changed his tecnique like the things that you maybe fought against when you're a child or a teenager now you've overcome them he just changes his tactic he changes his warfare we have to change our warfare also the Word of God is still our weapon and it meets in time conditions it has been sent to overcome the enemy but you got to use wisdom and say now how do I fight this warfare you must know how to fight a good warfare yeah now see here in this last verse I charge you I come out on to the son timber according to the prophecies which went which went on before thee that thou by their modest war a good warfare now when I read this I was thinking now we have prophecies that our God on before us you may not have been aware of it but you have been prophesied of amen from Genesis to Revelation this prophecies concerning you and you may not have been aware of it but you're a fulfillment if you're the Bride of Christ of this hour you are a fulfillment of prophecy amen that there's been prophets have prophesied foretold that there will be a people rise in the endtime hallelujah and you you just happen to be here so by those prophecies you may know how to fight a good warfare have you looked at the prophecies concerning you Jesus knew the word he had to fulfill he looked at the prophecies concerning himself he knew he was there to fulfill Isaiah the Spirit Lord has upon me to know to preach the gospel to the poor and said it captain him that have bruised and you know you're a priest acceptable year of the Lord and in that prophecy he kept the last verse in half because the second part of that last verse that prophecy was for a second coming but he found it in the Book of Isaiah he didn't disclose his eyes and flip it open and point to a scripture and read he found what he was looking for cause he knew he was here to fulfill that prophecy now you have to know the prophecies you have been seen to feel full we'll just go through to let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the white linen for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God that's one prophecy I mean you were where you say well how do you fight a good warfare by that prophecy well this prophecy is telling me these are people being going to be married to our Lord Jesus Christ that they become the wife of the Lamb now if they are the wife of the Lamb it's just like it well it still is today it's still illegal for me to go marry a dog he said well that's over that's very silly but I can't marry something that's not my species I mean I had to find someone that matched me oh yeah I'm so glad I did and it's like any any man looking for a woman to marry or vice versa you're looking for someone that matches you hallelujah so now if God if the lamb is looking for another lamb to marry he's looking for people that have his nature that have his characteristics they have the same life that was in him as in her amen so now you're going to say well how do you fight how do you fight a wolf here based on that what Jesus knew who he was he knew he was the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world he knew that he was the Messiah that had come to the earth he knew that he was God's chosen vessel to redeem mankind that's what he knew for this cause I've come into the world and he stood upon the word he didn't use his great power to overcome Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone that's just that you know Moses said that in the book of Deuteronomy he just pulled out he had a big arsenal that's like you know Jesus had a big arsenal of word to to go in and get to combat the enemy's attack he just pulled that out it is written it is written it is written and the devil came back yes and well it's also rendered he says it's also written and the devil thought he would have had him there made him fall but he came against someone that he didn't know anything then it said he never conquered I mean came against before and the devil who lost that fight so now he stood upon the word that was according to him and he subjected himself to the scripture that he had to fulfill just like when he went to Calvary as a man he subjected this flesh why do you think he had such agony in the garden you know drops of blood he sweating drops of blood and great agony there and gets M&E because he knew what he had to fulfill he knew that he was going to be headed at the hands of wicked men he knew is going to be mud beyond any man he knew those things and so he knew he had to fulfill that and not only just the physical wounding he knew he had to go to hell with the sins of the world on him and that's far worse than a physical wounding and so now that's why I had the great agony but he subjected himself and that great trial he subjected this flesh for the Word of God and that's how we overcame and it must be to say now that's how he he fought a good warfare that's how he overcame right and so it has to be the same thing if if he overcame that way then the bride will sure overcome that way when we subject ourselves to the word that's a lot of to us to fulfill hallelujah amen and he saw also the reason he did it because the joy that was set before him the scripture says there was a joy set before him that's why he he considered his own life less important than your life hallelujah because if he didn't go we wouldn't be here and there wouldn't be a marriage supper of the Lamb and there wouldn't be the redeemed of all ages gathered around the throne amen and he would have lost a part of himself he would have lost the feminist part of himself so there was a joy set before him that's why he waited up sit down it's a greater joy the joy of the joy of my children my wife being gathered to me how Lou you that I can I can become one with her as a far greater joy I mean in the suffering I may have to go through to fulfill the scripture and it should be the same thing with us amen heaven is far greater than we can imagine hallelujah and it's far more worth it then than anything that we may have to physically think we have to give up amen don't you want to go to heaven don't you want to go on a rapture don't you want to miss a tribulation hallelujah you know it's like someone giving you a hundred million dollars and you say no I'm not going to use it I'm not going to touch it it's kind of a bit insane amen no old people will think different of because I have this you know they may think good of you because you got money but anyway they'll think differently anyway maybe it's not such a good example but you know you don't want to just take the whole thing take the joy I trust he gives you realize of faith amen that is not a hope so faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things unseen now the word hope there in the New Testament is not like you buy I trust no one does here amen but it's like if someone goes and buys a lotto ticket there's a big I don't know what the crazy jackpots are now you know I'm gonna win this I hope I win this that's just there may be a stab in the dark kind of hope that's not Bible Hope Bible hope is an expectation it's going to happen I mean that is Bible hope so if you have faith faith is the evidence of things unseen so it's actually something you possess that it's going to happen it's not a hope so well I think this will work and I think it'll work out no it's a it's an evidence you've received something that it's going to happen hallelujah amen now the marriage of the lamb has come she has made herself ready because it was granted unto her that should be arrayed in fine linen which is the righteousness of the saints now that's a prophecy we are living out there prophecy amen and if you're not arrayed in the righteousness of saints it's here to be arraigned arrayed in hallelujah the wedding supper call has come brother Brown preaches a sermon as your life worthy of the gospel and he takes the parable of the wedding feast and the recess is three pulls there's three calls to this wedding feast and he said to Pentecost and into the last one was called the good and the bad to halt the blind whatever the lame bring them to my feast and he says doubt the third the third call the third pull invitation to the wedding supper is this word it's not the discernment or the healing it's now the word he sees the Pentecostals turned down amen this spiritual feast and they so they turn down their invitation to the winning supper amen but unto us who will halt lame and blind in the highways and byways the good the bad whatever condition we were in he doesn't care come to the feast hallelujah and we come to the door Christ Jesus and and we repeatedly back Theisen his name and we and he fills us with a spirit we'll get a raid in a new room how they were anointed our feet are washed I mean the dirt of the world has been washed us wash washed off us hallelujah been anointed with the Spirit of God would be arrayed in a robe and when you go after because it's a process when you'd come into a wedding feasts in that day that's what happened your feet will wash your rate at a different robe and you anointed you cursed you made welcome and you went into the feast so it doesn't matter if you had the finest clothes on or for your threadbare after you go through that process you all look the same hallelujah it's the same thing with us I'm glad about that here's another one blessed be the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace sure and he hath made us accepted in the beloved hallelujah there wasn't just for the Ephesians that was a prophecy I mean because there had to be a people that would be predestinated unto the adoption of children so they would be placed amen because we know adoption in the Bible is not you you getting someone out of a family that's not a blood relation to you and they become your child that's not Bible adoption Bible adoption is there's a child born into the family and when they come to a certain age they are placed in a in a place of responsibility in the family that's Bible adoption it means that we have been predestinated unto he's predestined us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ so we have been predestinated to come to our position in him amen that's how our destiny has been predetermined that we would come to our place we say well how does how does that how do how do we wore a good work warfare by that prophecy well those who have been ordained to be in their place I mean ordained they've been predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself as exactly as as Caleb and Joshua and those ones that came out of Egypt they were Caleb was predestinated to take that mountain in the promised land that was his position in the land that was his place in the body right that was this place in the body just like we have different places in the body I mean his ministry gifts and helps and governments and and you know different gifts like that and God places us all in the body of Christ we're not all the same we're not all the finger or an eye or a foot or a ear or whatever we have all different roles to play in the body and God by His Holy Spirit takes herself to him birth and he moves us into that place and it's the same thing with with Caleb coming out of Egypt by Moses he came out of Egypt and then the Holy Spirit moved him into his place in the body in the promised land and he was then living in that place yes Amen do it one following me so he was predestinated to that position or to that adoption in the body and so he took it he ward a good warfare he said well how did he had a war good wittle' by that he says there's a place in this land I want that Mountain God give me that mountain and God placed him where where he was meant to be in the land amen that's how Ward a good warfare now 2nd Timothy 1:5 2:8 now it says here when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in me was dropped first of my grandmother Lois and in my and my mother Eunice and I am persuaded that is in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance that they'll stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting a lot of hands for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God so here he was if we walk if we find any good wolf here there's an enemy to fight against and he will try and discourage us he will try and stop the gift of God operating in our lives now the gift faith is a gift faith is a gift we all have a gift you say but I'm not a singer or a musician or a preacher or whatever but we all have a gift we all have a gift of faith right but in the enemy just like Timothy here something came against Timothy that actually disabled his ministry something came against them then he wasn't prop maybe wasn't prepared for and it actually derailed them a bit I mean so this is what happened to him so Paul is writing to Timothy saying stir up the gift the gift of God in your life he's saying this is how you actually overcome this problem amen because the enemy we will be tested by every spirit we will be tested by every spirit in the siege and because the devil changes his warfare it's like if you're trying to take a fortified position you may send in your infantry first they get mowed down ok now we've got to change what we do and then maybe now we'll drop some paratroopers and behind and try that making it wiped out well we'll change what we'll do you change your tactics ok now we do know you know an artillery bombardment maybe a spy get in and do some infiltration whatever more they the enemy is always changing his tactics and so the enemy will now change his tactics against you he will and so now you have to be prepared now because the enemy will come and he may be defeated one time it's like with Jesus after I think when he was in the wilderness that says and Satan just left him for a season the devil didn't just give up he came back again he changed his tactics and as to save them against us the devil has and will changes tactics against you Amen it's just like now rule one sweet group as brother Bram said rule one big sweet group but you be careful the enemy will come in and he'll try and scatter you try and divide you amen so the enemy no because the devil was cast out by sickness and unbelief and disease and all these things and so now he changed this tactic now how could I get in among these people because I can't have God's people together I mean because of this harmony in the body nothing can stand before yo I can't stand before those kind of people it's like when when I think it's in the Psalms David said how great is the unity among brethren that's like the anointing all that runs off Aaron's beard now Aaron had to be anointed with that anointing oil in order to operate as the high priest amen he had to be anointed in order to operate as the high priest and David's actually saying that if there's unity among the people then the body of Christ can operate according to what God wants them to be aim it that's why unity is very important so the devil comes and he tries to you know bring in a fuss or a misunderstanding or whatever more and you know we have different we have different personalities and iron sharpens iron and you know all these things go on and we have misunderstandings it's the enemy trying to get in it's the enemy because love now covers a multitude of sins doesn't you know so someone can do something wrong against someone but now if you hold that against them then now the devil can have a channel to work I mean and if that doesn't work well then maybe he'll he'll get you lifted up and pride see I was reading through if you go study the Kings who studied the Kings in the Bible always look at where maybe we have voice in my mind look at where the believers failed go from Genesis and study where the believers failed because brother MCS we should study our enemy we should study our enemy so we should actually see not only where they succeeded but where they failed because the enemy will come against you in the same way and he will try and get you to fail the same way they did you say well but they were just under the blood of bulls and goats run like we're under the blood of Jesus Christ but there's no temptation which is common to men that that we are attacked by right and so now you see use our you see here's a car you see driving Josiah might get the wrong but they but they were doing God prospered them and bless them and bless them and bless them and then they came to a place where thought they could just do anything and God will just bless it because they are lifted up and prayed because of where God had placed them but in Deuteronomy it says that the king's army to write out the law because that would keep them humble because they would see the blessings and the cursings of the law so they would see they would see the reward by keeping the word but then they'd also see the penalty for disobeying the word amen and now you say but we're not under the law we may not be under the law because the Spirit of God comes into our lives and causes us to live the word right I meant but then also on the same token there is a penalty for disobeying the Word of God amen but grace enables us to live the word because it changes our nature that is not our own carnal nature ruling us anymore where we do everything according to lust the I the pride of life and the flesh and everything but it's now his life in us that we live according to the word but you see the devil try and get us lifted up and pray amen and false humility false humility he will try and get us a truth because he'll change his tactic against us I meant so you got to look at look at where they fail they stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of hands now we all have a gift of faith you got to stir up that faith amen stir up when you say well how do you stir up that faith you got to have a testimony service you got to you have to you have to go back through your life and say God you brought me here you called me out of the world you spoke to me you separated me how Lia from the spirit of this world you transform me you've redeemed me you've saved me has he done it for you I mean you've returned back in your life and say well he moved back there amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he's allowed me to come to this place what do you think Paul and Silas were there in the jail they weren't you know they begin to sing and they begin to I believe testified to one another I mean they would beaten down saying well this is the end and you know we ran a good race and we've got out in a few scrapes but I don't see how we can get out of this one no they begin to sing they begin to pray they say thank you Lord amen and it stirred up a gift the gift of faith in their lives and God came down and they were loosed it's always good always have a positive confession the devil may be on your case but say Lord you're greater than that enemy you've allowed this to happen because you want to show me something of yourself in this battle I mean it's the reason you have the battle our God isn't in the back looking and with the binoculars saying how you doing in the front I mean he's he's fighting before you he's in the front row I'll show you how it's done hallelujah that's exactly how it is yes but you see but you see Gideon's son was afraid he was afraid will this work can I actually take the lives of these enemies we can't be afraid God didn't our Lord Jesus didn't send this message to make us afraid if it works or not amen he didn't send it to make this Bible live that would be afraid if the Bible works or not amen there's life in this word where it will produce what it's meant to produce we don't need to worry how it's going to work you just yield yourself to it and there's a life in it you see this missus has gone around the world it has a life of its own people have thrown it out there's a there's a buried Aboriginal church in in in Australia somebody had a whole bunch of missus books they threw it into the trash this is a bridge no guy comes along picks it up he begins to read it he becomes a pasta there's a church and there's heaven more than one place God allowed that to happen amen and there's far more supernatural things in just people throwing out books people picking out books I mean this brother ro Shannon and the Punjab in in India picked up a book yes yes to teach himself English to read it hallelujah and the places there's this churches and ministries roast up all over that northern part of India and places where there's anti conversion laws all because the man picked up a book and said I want to know what this is hallelujah and this farm will besides in just those two but there's a life in this word you don't know what it will do to someone I didn't know what it would do to me when I first plugged it in my ears and listens good morning friends hallelujah amen there's a life in it you say well how do you know I know because I've had the experience I don't have the church to guide me whatever more I had the message in the Bible and God came in quickened it hallelujah I'm glad this amen and it still works today it still works today now David we have to what we have to do friends we have children you got to bring them up with you bring them up with you don't put them down here Samuel was a young boy he was ministering to the Lord in the temple amen he was just a young boy David wasn't very old when he killed Goliath hallelujah they may be young but they look at age don't look at age say I used to you know that's like when you first get a child in your arms I often think what is in this child you don't know what's in that child even they say well this is the man versus the dead this is you know but what suddenly you think you think we're most of all any even even the prophet Elijah are you summer freeze yeah yeah for the example he was just he just came out of the wilderness do you think his parents really knew what was in him this one this one God is gonna use and he's gonna go on a rapture and he's gonna stand against all this bow worship we detest do you think they knew what was in him Peter James and John you know they're they're fishermen daddy's picked them up this one's gonna have the keys to the kingdom he's gonna fulfill the prophecy of Joel off I'll pull my spirit out upon all flesh and he'll stand they say this is that spoken by the Prophet Joel and day of Pentecost do you think then you they don't know we take moody or you know some of the great some of the great evangelists and things of you know in our era all the other former age do you think they're their parents knew what was in them know what's in your children have you ever thought about them in a spiritual way what gift there's something in every child there's a reason they're in your family there are reason that they've heard this word there's a reason it's not a haphazard thing that they sit and they're in the presence of God hallelujah and they see you've been changed there's a reason and you've got to look at them and say and prayerfully say God what is in my child I want to see you express if it's the sing if it's to pray if it's just to be an unseen one that's the unseen part of the body whatever part of the body that to fulfill I say Lord I want to see that manifested of yes they're not just children Amy and all the children say Amen you know just a little one hallelujah yes Amen now so we have to bring them up that they're right by us we don't have to tell them everything that we fighters as parents but bring them up to where you are how God is alive he's he's risen he's present now we read in 2nd Samuel there comes a time where whether the next generation rises in Israel where David by this time David is already the king his king has been established but now the Philistines make war again you'll notice in the Bible such an important a crucial time when the younger generation comes up yeah you see with the Kings especially some of the Kings that come up they either do like their father did if they're good or they're evil but sometimes there's such a change where you see some of the Kings God supernaturally delivers the nation these fear and the nations around them because they're worshiping God incredible things happen and then the son comes to the throne and it's like he's never been there before and he just does exactly what the you know yeah yeah there's quite a few kings the very enemies that they that Israel defeated God defeated them he takes their gods and he sits them up in Israel and he's an Annie and I I you know I think what on earth possess someone to take the very one the very God that was defeated that didn't help their enemies and he began to worship that God are they defeated people we could have a sermon right now don't worship the god of this world do not worship the god of denomination do not worship the God anything out here it's being defeated it's been defeated don't don't worship put it in any formal manner or shape why-why-why take those things and put it in your house and and and give it obedience it didn't help them it won't help you amen this word will help you God is for us always know God is for you he's not against you our Lord is for us amen the Bible says that he's our advocate he's on our side amen now so moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel now this is very different from from Gideon son these ones are fighting with Israel and David went down and his servants with them and fought against the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear away three hundred shekels of brass and weight he'd been girded with a new sword thought to have slain David but ever shied the son of Zillah secured him helped him and smote the Philistine and killed him then the men of David swear unto him saying thou shalt no more go out with us to battle that that thou quench not the light of Israel oops how long I got more of the scripture maybe it's just in the wrong place yes and it came to pass after this that there was again a better with the Philistines at gob in ceviche the Hoscheit slew Sabbath which was of the sons of the giant then there was again a battle and God with the Philistines then Elden the son of I cannot pronounce that the Bethea might slay the brother of goliath look at the art this the staff of whose spear was like a Weaver's beam and there was yellow battle and gasps where was a man of great stature that was on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty and number and he also was born to the Giant and when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Samia the brother of David slew him these four were bored of the German death and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants there's a new generation rose up the enemy had a new generation and God had a new generation but this new generation on God's side were up in the battle I mean because Jonathan was David's nephew here that's Jonathan they were in the battle they had confidence in their weapon amen and they overcame the enemy we have to be like this amen as families as a church we need to be like this we're the younger generation steps up hallelujah yes you say well you're putting pressure on me no the weapons good the weapons good it doesn't get blunt it'll find its target its amen that's why you have confidence in your equipment you know it's like an army that goes to battle with some old antiquated stuff the morale is not too good you can be trained to a certain level but if you're fighting with weapons from World War two in this modern era you're not gonna do so well so you gotta have the training but you have confidence in your weapon this is their well he said he had five stones this is now this is now long David fighting Goliath he had five stones GES us what wasn't thousand five fingers if a ith faith wrapped up in Jesus here he went brother I'm telling I'm telling it sent the rock to the killing place down went Goliath you know what happened then the Israelites took courage and a way they went they kept Philistines plumb to the walls it takes one person that's got enough courage to step out and say it's right and God said so amen brother yield down a Goliath your whole family will go to cut and Philistines the first thing you know what's that in your hand what can you do testify sing do something another on the job do something for the glory of God I've seen in the days of judges little fellow named Shem guy and it's found out in the days of judges all he had was an ox code it took one man to stand up and have courage be that one be that one he say well does that really work if someone stands up and says that's right God said so now I might get this testimony completely wrong but Christine was what about twenty years old in America in a convention brother Isaac was there and the pillar fly was moving and she said a little big war fighter to me God came down she's out speaking another language or joy sing and shouting dancing and then she comes back to New Zealand and they begin to pray there in Turanga and God came down and people Melanie received the Holy Ghost amen and they had a service and there was young people in that church and they see they didn't even believe in God anymore and God came down in a powerful way and now we've been given in a hostile God and it was a spiritual awakening because one person stood up said Lord be glorified in me and you know you'd be cutting Philistines to the walls hallelujah and that wasn't that long ago amen stand up no it's it sir hallelujah what are the Philistines reface they're not people I mean this demon powers try to keep us down keep us down informality and all this just goodbye and the world is busy and you're busy you have no time I mean to find those full of stars hallelujah now I'm just going to finish with this season after the boldero came the musket and after the musket came the Springfield to leave reaction rifle and now the atomic weapons and things see we keep going growing more but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now seeing there's going to be a conflict and there is going to be a battle god equipped us children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they had need that would sweep them all all the way from Eden to the rapture I was blessed when I read that what was it the word the word that's what defeat Satan is the word it will defeat them anywhere any place anywhere any place not just here on your job driving down the road and the supermarket at home you're just going to have a bit of love amen and God loves you without looking for anything in return unconditional love and it should be the same thing with us we should look at our family and just love them pick is what they do love their you to think long term this world is an instant world my coffees not quick enough the microwave is too slow the internet the broadband is too slow point 2 of a second I can't wait to point to of a second I need to have my answer now God has long term you can't just do a you know it's like in a battle when two armies are fighting and one of them it's not the one who wins the battle is the one who wins the war they are the victors the ones who win the war not the battle you see it all through history the Japanese World War two they had a lot of success initially so did the Nazis they didn't win the war they won a lot of battles but they lost the war has to be the same thing with us you gotta think long-term long term yes I say love as if you're not looking for anything in return because then you're looking at conditions and you're looking at the promise now anyplace anywhere now why do we want to substitute something else when we're already got the best thing there is the word and we find Jesus on earth just to prove this was the best equipment when Satan came in hand-to-hand combat with Jesus he never reached over with his power and tied his hands he just took the same weapon that God I gave him the Garden of Eden his word he said it's written it's written and he punched him right out of the ring with it I mean that's right because it's God's best and look where it is it's not just for one or two in the church it's for every one of us hello every one of us do you fit in that category amen let's just I'll just read this off here because it's too small he says every believer in and and I'm gonna close with this with this court here he says every believer has a right to take this word and fight the enemy where ever you meet him anywhere you meet the enemy this word is what you have to use and Jesus proved it when he come so he equipped us children with the word for their protection against the enemy when the all-out warfare comes the battle set an array there's only one thing a real soldier can use a real Christian soldier that's thus saith the Lord walk right up there and meet the enemy with the assurance that nothing thousand may fall at your right side ten thousand left but it won't come no they just remember that God made this statement and give it to his children and it's the best that has ever been yet Satan in the garden when he first come to thee to these attacks to attack the person knowing the children of God was fortified with this word Satan attacked the word seat he never attacked the being he attacked the word first look at that sneakin lizard what he does today the first thing he can't lay it on saying well that's not a good person that's a good presidency but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny that word that's just the only thing he wants to do get you to to deny that word because if you have Comfort if you have no faith in your weapon you are disarmed but your faith in your weapon then you'll use your weapon and you'll win the victory I mean let's have some musicians this morning amen don't be like Gideon son you read in the next chapter of of Judges Gideon's half-brother rises up and he kills all of other Gideon's all all other children and he becomes the leader including that son that we read about that would not kill his enemies we don't want to fall into that category of person we have a weapon you say well I'm under an attack we'll take the Word of God amen rejoice in your salvation Amen you say well I don't know if I have the joy he say Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation amen David didn't say restore my salvation restore the joy of my salvation amen let's dance shall we can we can we I'm just gonna load it on your owner can we sing that song I'm a mighty warrior can we do that if we don't have the right okay so I mean let's just sing the shall we may brother Isaac you turn them up brother I will love those they can't meet Jesus Christ I'll always have
