[38:50] but I believe the Lord has a word for us
[38:53] tonight each and individual you know all
[38:56] of us an individual word that's going to
[38:58] speak I believe is going to speak to all
[38:59] of us by the time he says amen at the
[39:01] end of the service God's gonna speak to
[39:03] us all personally who believes that
[39:04] tonight amen so praise God Amen so let's
[39:07] sing this as um brother Albert comes I
[39:09] mean tonight I feel
[39:13] [Music]
[39:18] I am
[39:30] Christmas
[39:32] [Music]
[39:42] be through
[39:50] me I agree
[39:59] [Music]
[40:01] ment
[40:13] amen amen
[40:16] let's just pray first Heavenly Father we
[40:19] come tonight to meditate upon your word
[40:22] and Lord unless you quickener to us and
[40:25] reveal something it's just words but we
[40:28] talk about a word of God and we pray
[40:30] that you're an anointing will come and
[40:32] minister to us Lord you know our hearts
[40:35] and our needs and our position in life
[40:38] and I just pray that he would encourage
[40:40] us tonight you know commit us into your
[40:43] hands and and I pray that your Holy
[40:45] Spirit has full control in Jesus
[40:48] Christ's name amen amen just before we
[40:52] um
[40:53] read the word I just want to say it's
[40:56] lovely to be here and to see
[40:59] not just natural family spiritual family
[41:01] as well
[41:02] and it's always good the real family is
[41:05] the spiritual family but when the
[41:07] natural family followers the Lord is
[41:09] twice as wonderful amen I've got a few
[41:13] thoughts tonight and just read one
[41:15] scripture while we stand
[41:18] well-known scripture
[41:20] Genesis 3 9.
[41:23] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[41:27] said unto him where are thou
[41:29] and you may be seated
[41:32] where are thou
[41:34] where am I tonight right now
[41:38] in Christ in a body of Christ in in my
[41:41] life situation
[41:43] because you see
[41:45] there is
[41:46] a season for everything we we know
[41:49] Ecclesiastes says that uh to everything
[41:52] there is a season and a time to every
[41:55] purpose under the heaven
[41:58] so we need to know where we at yeah we
[42:02] all are at a on a journey we know that
[42:04] or on the pilgrimage it sounds even
[42:07] better
[42:08] but not all of us are in the exact same
[42:12] place spiritually
[42:14] I always find um
[42:16] you know sometimes people like like you
[42:18] to see everything alike but it's like
[42:21] with children
[42:22] when they're part of the family that may
[42:25] not know everything you know
[42:27] but they're still part of the family so
[42:29] that's the unity of the spirit but we
[42:32] try to come to an understanding and an
[42:34] agreement in all things
[42:37] but what I'm saying there is
[42:40] a specific word of God for specific
[42:44] people
[42:46] you know there was a word in the Old
[42:48] Testament I I'll make some reference to
[42:50] it later
[42:52] you know the children of Israel there
[42:54] was a type there was a word for the
[42:56] nation through the prophet God spoke for
[43:00] the nation and the word that was spoken
[43:03] was for everyone for everyone yeah
[43:06] yeah but now we are in a love
[43:08] relationship with a Heavenly bridegroom
[43:10] so we have an individual word we are not
[43:14] part of their even though God makes us
[43:18] one but we are individually lead by the
[43:21] Holy Spirit
[43:23] so therefore it's important that we have
[43:26] a word from the Lord individually
[43:29] and
[43:33] so how do you know
[43:35] I I said this way I get a lot of times
[43:38] people ask me advice and what should I
[43:41] do brother I always and should I go
[43:43] there or should I do this I I just can't
[43:46] say I don't know where he is what he
[43:49] prayed for what the Lord has in mind for
[43:51] you I said keep on seeking the Lord
[43:52] until you have confirmation and the
[43:55] witness about it
[43:57] but you see it's it's like
[44:00] um we we say we have the compass uh the
[44:03] the map the road map the Bible and we
[44:07] have to Compass the Holy Spirit
[44:09] now I for those who have been
[44:12] in the bush
[44:14] and if you go hunting if if you don't
[44:16] have a GPS through all these things you
[44:19] have a map and you have a compass
[44:22] now remember one year I went in the bush
[44:25] and and I thought I thought I heard the
[44:28] deer you know gone off the track and I
[44:30] ran down the hill and you know and you
[44:33] know you start to hear things and see
[44:35] things and there was no there there
[44:38] but I didn't know where it was I just
[44:40] got off the track and uh what do you do
[44:45] I have to find my place back onto that
[44:48] track
[44:50] now
[44:51] how can you find
[44:54] your way back on the track first you
[44:56] have to know where you are
[44:58] it's impossible to know where to go
[45:02] unless you know where you are
[45:04] I knew I went South off the track
[45:08] so I knew I was somewhere down here so I
[45:11] knew if I go north north west I hit that
[45:14] track sooner or later
[45:18] I think I walked for about three hours
[45:20] fighting my way through the bush got it
[45:22] hurt and injured and slipped and and it
[45:25] was such thick bush but the compass kept
[45:28] on telling me this direction
[45:30] and I I couldn't understand I only
[45:33] rained down the hill for about 10
[45:34] minutes and now after three hours
[45:35] walking
[45:36] and
[45:39] never give up
[45:41] you know I was two meters away from the
[45:43] Trek and the compass it through there
[45:45] that thick bush and the dead and stepped
[45:48] on the track
[45:49] but you know
[45:50] if somebody said which way should I go I
[45:53] would say where are you yeah yeah you
[45:55] have to know where you are before you
[45:58] can be late yeah and a lot of times
[46:01] people follow the leadership of somebody
[46:04] else
[46:05] but they're in a different position and
[46:08] uh to go forward we need to know where
[46:10] we are that's what I'm trying to say
[46:13] in Hebrews eight the second part of the
[46:16] verse there
[46:18] uh in the Amplified Bible it says for
[46:21] when Moses was about to erect the
[46:23] Tabernacle he was warned by God saying
[46:28] see that thou maketh all exactly
[46:32] according to the pattern which was shown
[46:35] to you on the mountain
[46:38] so he had to go back to that pattern
[46:40] that was shown to him at the mountains
[46:43] and not oh it would be a good idea to
[46:46] put another room there or make a little
[46:48] office on the side no it had to be
[46:51] according to the perfect way God showed
[46:54] it so human nature gets impatient
[46:59] we want an answer now when we have a
[47:02] problem we want an answer right now
[47:04] and sometimes the law gives you an
[47:06] answer and sometimes you wait and wait
[47:10] you know
[47:11] you came
[47:12] push thing up put out the fleece you
[47:15] know you know what you want you put out
[47:17] a fleece use this Lord is this your will
[47:19] is this you will and uh
[47:22] sometimes it isn't a perfect will of God
[47:25] it's our impatience
[47:27] and I've seen that in my own life for
[47:31] times you know you want to do something
[47:32] when I um was a young Christian
[47:37] I didn't know
[47:39] um I felt the Lord spoke to me that I
[47:42] should wait with getting married because
[47:44] I was
[47:46] living a worldly life until I was 27 and
[47:49] then the Lord taught me to wait five
[47:50] years
[47:52] and I thought wow where to now where to
[47:55] now I needed to know instantly open the
[47:57] Bible and got a verse that spoke to me
[48:01] and then I thought what was it maybe I
[48:03] should apply for the Bible school you
[48:04] know you sort of go down their track but
[48:07] the Lord has other plans for you
[48:10] you know it's not bad planes but it's
[48:13] it's our own doing or impatient
[48:15] impatience so um we run run to and fro
[48:20] sometimes and get disappointments until
[48:22] we actually know where we at
[48:25] Lord where am I at I need more of you
[48:28] before I can give more to others and if
[48:30] they're certainly that Lord am I really
[48:33] in the right place and quite often we
[48:37] have all these ideas
[48:39] but we don't even know where we are you
[48:42] know there's never been a time like now
[48:44] where this Bible says
[48:49] a lot of people don't know it you look
[48:52] at the signs of the last days you know
[48:55] people are so blinded
[48:58] they don't even know it love is a
[49:01] pleasure lovers of themselves and and
[49:03] all these things they don't even know
[49:05] what they
[49:07] it is
[49:09] maybe have an idea you know it's getting
[49:11] close to the coming of the Lord but they
[49:13] don't know where they are are at
[49:15] themselves
[49:17] and unless you we know where we are
[49:19] we're not going places
[49:20] we just go around circles
[49:24] so I'd like to encourage you to to know
[49:27] before the Lord exactly where you are so
[49:30] he can direct you where he wants you to
[49:32] be
[49:34] so
[49:37] do yourself invite upon the Lord
[49:41] you know last last year I was driving
[49:44] around the South Island
[49:45] and often when I drive I pray
[49:48] and uh something two things happened
[49:51] which were quite incredible I was
[49:54] driving them praying
[49:56] and I don't know why I said what I said
[49:59] I said sorry Lord for overtaking you I
[50:02] mean I was driving I wasn't overtaking
[50:04] the Lord what am I saying but then I
[50:07] realized yes I don't want to go ahead of
[50:09] the Lord I want to follow the lord and
[50:12] so I said I took that on board
[50:15] and then uh I carry on driving and then
[50:18] I started to sing to sing
[50:21] and
[50:22] it was just uh wonderful I said I just
[50:26] made up a song you know you how it goes
[50:28] when you when you do single prey and I
[50:31] said
[50:33] have you ever heard them say
[50:35] I love you
[50:36] have you ever heard him say you're mine
[50:39] have you ever ever heard him say I die
[50:42] for your sins have you ever heard him
[50:44] say
[50:45] and then it was quite a song
[50:48] and then I sort of made the next verse
[50:51] yes I heard him say and there I was
[50:54] confirming the word and then the
[50:56] presence of God came in the car yeah you
[50:58] know be in the right place and think the
[51:01] right things apply to you I think it's
[51:03] it's really wonderful
[51:05] so knowing where you are at will help us
[51:09] to see who he is
[51:12] you see Israel was a type or a pattern
[51:16] from which we can learn
[51:19] problem is sometimes people try to copy
[51:21] their pattern you can't copy the pattern
[51:23] the pattern is is like for us to learn
[51:26] it's not to do the same thing
[51:29] right
[51:31] the children of Israel knew that they
[51:34] were in slavery they knew it
[51:37] I mean it didn't need to be a scientist
[51:40] to find out during slavery when you beat
[51:42] them and work and how they get any food
[51:45] so they knew they were enslaved
[51:50] they knew that the only one
[51:53] and living God that the Living God could
[51:55] help them they knew that as well yeah
[51:58] so they prayed and cried
[52:00] until Moses came
[52:03] so that's what the fact was in Exodus 3
[52:07] from verse 1
[52:10] it says now Moses kept the flock of
[52:14] testro his father-in-law the priest of
[52:18] the median
[52:19] and he led the flock on the backside of
[52:22] the desert and came to the Mountain of
[52:24] God even to Horeb
[52:27] so Moses went about his natural business
[52:30] we we know he tried before
[52:33] to fulfill the plan of God you know to
[52:37] he heard about
[52:39] the great God and he heard about how he
[52:42] can deliver so he tried to do his own
[52:44] strength and we know it was a flop and
[52:47] he ended up in a desert and working uh
[52:50] there but he went about his business
[52:54] he didn't do anything special just many
[52:57] looking after the Sheep and then it says
[53:00] in the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[53:01] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[53:04] of a bush
[53:05] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[53:08] with fire and the Bush was not consumed
[53:12] now the time had come
[53:15] God's time for Moses that was the time
[53:19] before it was all man's doing but that
[53:22] was the time and he had to learn not to
[53:27] do anything just to go about the
[53:29] business until God comes on the scene
[53:32] yeah you know we we
[53:34] especially when we're young we we can do
[53:38] a lot of things we can sort out things
[53:40] you know
[53:42] in in many ways in the in the natural
[53:44] way if somebody gives you trouble you
[53:47] can sort it out with you first you know
[53:48] if you're strong enough
[53:50] and you can sort it out in other ways if
[53:53] you're clever enough but that may not be
[53:55] the way to do it yeah wait upon the Lord
[53:58] so he it was his time and Moses said
[54:03] uh
[54:04] and Moses said I will now turn aside and
[54:08] see this great sight why the bush is not
[54:11] burnt
[54:13] you see he didn't expect the
[54:15] supernatural to come his way he thought
[54:18] he was a failure he failed God 40 years
[54:21] later Here Comes Scott on the scene you
[54:24] see when you're chosen by God from
[54:26] before the foundation of the world then
[54:28] it's not this year it has to happen
[54:30] tonight has to happen next year has to
[54:33] happen in God's time we're in his
[54:36] program and it's a time to come you know
[54:39] it's it's like the great Symphony we
[54:41] know about you know you know a great
[54:43] Symphony and I never forget when I went
[54:46] to school we had one man a boy he he uh
[54:51] played in the in a Orchestra
[54:54] I thought wow he plays in an orchestra
[54:56] he played the symbols I only had to
[54:59] strike the things once or twice during a
[55:01] symphony but at the right time
[55:04] at the right time he had to wait his
[55:06] turn read the music wait wait to do bang
[55:09] and he did his part you see you know
[55:12] your time comes but you know it's it's
[55:15] it's it's actually like that he didn't
[55:17] even play the flute or the trumpet just
[55:19] hit those things together at the right
[55:22] time that's important
[55:24] otherwise it makes a mess but Moses
[55:27] didn't expect the supernatural but when
[55:30] the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[55:33] God called unto him out of the midst of
[55:36] the abortion said Moses Moses and he
[55:38] said who am I
[55:40] he said God calls you by name that's
[55:42] that wonderful thing
[55:44] if that burning fire calls you by name
[55:47] you know it's God dealing with you
[55:50] and it it's just absolutely amazing and
[55:54] he said draw not now Heather put off thy
[55:57] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[56:00] where I'm thou stainless is Holy Ground
[56:04] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[56:08] father
[56:09] the god of Abraham
[56:12] the god of Isaac
[56:14] and the god of Jacob you know he
[56:16] identified himself and Moses hid his
[56:19] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[56:22] and the Lord said listen to this I have
[56:26] surely seen
[56:28] the Affliction of my people which are in
[56:31] Egypt
[56:32] and have heard their Cry by reason of
[56:35] their task Masters for I know
[56:37] their sorrows
[56:40] but only now was the time right you see
[56:43] he heard their cry they probably thought
[56:46] why doesn't God answer
[56:48] it wasn't the time for it yeah right but
[56:51] now was the time for the Deliverance
[56:54] it says here you know
[56:58] only no I wrote it that only now was the
[57:01] time right for deliverance not when
[57:04] Moses by religious knowledge tried to do
[57:07] it but when God's time is right and when
[57:11] we are no longer trusting in our own
[57:14] strength and that comes to that you know
[57:17] so many times
[57:18] we get frustrated because we trust in
[57:21] our own strength yeah and then things
[57:23] don't go our way and uh
[57:27] can be very very hard but when the time
[57:30] is right with the Lord which is rest in
[57:32] it we just rest in it
[57:34] then it says and I am come down to
[57:37] deliver them out of the land of the
[57:39] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[57:42] that land unto a good land and a large
[57:45] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[57:47] and to the place of the Canaanites and
[57:50] the Hittites and the amorites and the
[57:53] parasites and the
[57:55] High bytes and the gpsides you see God
[57:59] not only promised to take them out of
[58:02] Egypt but he also promised to bring them
[58:04] into a land
[58:06] that flies with milk and honey you know
[58:08] sometimes we just get out of a place but
[58:11] we fail to enter in
[58:13] you know we can get out of a life of sin
[58:16] we can stop smoking we can stop drinking
[58:19] we can stop all sorts of things and try
[58:21] not to swear so much and all this kind
[58:23] of things we come out of it but we have
[58:26] to enter in into that rest that's that's
[58:28] what what really counts
[58:31] and the promise is to come out and enter
[58:35] in that's that's the promise
[58:40] now therefore Behold The Cry of the
[58:43] children of Israel is come unto me
[58:46] and I have also seen the oppression with
[58:48] the Egyptians oppressed them to the Lord
[58:51] is aware of all these things come now
[58:54] therefore now we sent the unto Pharaoh
[58:56] that thou mayest bring forth my people
[58:58] and the children of Israel out of Egypt
[59:01] and Moses said unto God who am I that I
[59:06] should go unto pharaoh and that I should
[59:08] bring forth the children of Israel out
[59:10] of Egypt
[59:12] and he said certainly
[59:14] I will be with thee
[59:17] and this shall be
[59:19] a token unto thee that I have sent thee
[59:22] when thou has brought forth the people
[59:25] out of Egypt You Shall Serve God upon
[59:28] this mountain
[59:30] man what what a statement it takes you
[59:34] know it's like a proactive
[59:36] promise
[59:38] that can only be applied to a believer
[59:41] you know he wasn't sure in himself Moses
[59:45] says he said how can I do that
[59:50] and God says certainly I will be with
[59:52] thee
[59:53] yeah what else do we need amen God's
[59:55] presence with us
[59:57] and this shall be a token unto thee
[1:00:01] a sign that I have spoken to you but
[1:00:05] that was in the future
[1:00:07] and I have sent thee when thou has
[1:00:09] brought forth the people out of Egypt
[1:00:11] after you've brought him out
[1:00:13] You Shall Serve me on this mountain you
[1:00:16] see it's not
[1:00:18] I'll show you give you a sign now or or
[1:00:21] or another sign now once you actually
[1:00:25] followed my advice followed the word I
[1:00:30] will then confirm it so it is not a
[1:00:33] matter of hearing it and wanting
[1:00:36] confirmation no it's a matter of
[1:00:38] following the word and then God comes
[1:00:41] down and proves of it you see that I
[1:00:44] find that's quite an interesting verse
[1:00:46] how can
[1:00:48] somebody seeking a sign and how can you
[1:00:50] say
[1:00:51] God says to you
[1:00:54] um
[1:00:56] do a certain things go down downtown and
[1:00:59] handle the Bible to somebody and you say
[1:01:02] oh you're not sure is that the Lord and
[1:01:04] he said well you will know it's me after
[1:01:07] this person said such and such to you
[1:01:09] once you've done it yeah you know it
[1:01:12] goes that way
[1:01:13] you see the journey
[1:01:16] and its goal you know it was Deliverance
[1:01:19] from slavery
[1:01:22] Experiencing God on the journey
[1:01:25] test or faith and entering into the rest
[1:01:30] you know there's various parts of the
[1:01:32] journey and the instructions were
[1:01:34] different
[1:01:36] at every part of the journey
[1:01:38] that's why we can't just generally say
[1:01:41] do this or do that it depends where yet
[1:01:45] if you've never repented repent yeah
[1:01:48] yeah if you've never been baptized in
[1:01:50] the name of Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:01:51] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:01:53] Christ if you never hit the Holy Spirit
[1:01:55] experience raise your hands until you've
[1:01:58] filled with the spirit you see we cannot
[1:02:01] say just a general statement
[1:02:04] I I know it's different people have
[1:02:06] different ways of getting that
[1:02:09] experience and I just tell you
[1:02:12] my experience was very different
[1:02:16] uh or leading on to my experience was
[1:02:20] very different to my wife's experience
[1:02:23] I lived I believed in God since it was
[1:02:27] four years old
[1:02:29] even prayed and so God's helping me and
[1:02:32] doing things
[1:02:33] uh went in the Catholic church in stone
[1:02:37] Idols you know because I knew it was
[1:02:39] wrong to have Idol said you know I was
[1:02:41] sincere
[1:02:42] and then of course I didn't really know
[1:02:45] God in the power of the Holy Ghost even
[1:02:48] though I had experiences and then when I
[1:02:50] was 13 or 12 I wrote the little prayer
[1:02:54] on the wall in my bedroom and prayed
[1:02:57] every night the Lord's Prayer nobody
[1:02:59] else in in the family did that so it was
[1:03:03] believing in God
[1:03:05] but then well
[1:03:07] mixed uh when you sort of grow up 15 16
[1:03:12] few complexes and things and you try to
[1:03:15] compete with the world and be part of it
[1:03:18] and and it takes you further and further
[1:03:20] away from the Lord
[1:03:22] I still pray the Lord's Prayer every
[1:03:24] night and sometimes drunk sometimes I
[1:03:27] fell asleep halfway through and you know
[1:03:30] it drags him more and more into the ways
[1:03:32] of the world but then the time came when
[1:03:34] God called me out
[1:03:37] and he delivered me from from that way
[1:03:39] of life and he revealed himself to me
[1:03:42] and taught me who I was in him
[1:03:46] and then everything changed amen
[1:03:48] amen I wasn't and then I was in a church
[1:03:51] you couldn't raise your hands
[1:03:54] very conservative structure I ended up
[1:03:58] I had to go and then secrets and raise
[1:04:00] my hands and pray to the Lord our church
[1:04:03] oh gifts you know be careful you know I
[1:04:07] was at home
[1:04:08] so happy one night raising my hands
[1:04:10] praying and praying couldn't sleep after
[1:04:12] about 15 20 minutes suddenly I spoke in
[1:04:14] thanks I mean if the church would have
[1:04:17] known they would have said okay so
[1:04:18] that's of the devil or whatever yeah you
[1:04:21] know
[1:04:22] the holy spirit is not bound God's
[1:04:24] spirit is not bound so that was my
[1:04:26] experience I had a holy ghost experience
[1:04:28] actually I had the experience when I was
[1:04:30] in the car
[1:04:32] at that time I wasn't baptized or
[1:04:34] anything but when I heard more truth of
[1:04:37] course someone would walk in the load
[1:04:38] off to work so you step into it my wife
[1:04:41] was brought up in a message search
[1:04:44] how's that
[1:04:46] she never did wrong she never was in the
[1:04:48] world she never did all the things I did
[1:04:52] and it was lovely in the church
[1:04:55] environment
[1:04:56] now you feel pretty good when you go to
[1:04:58] church because you're amongst
[1:05:02] brothers and sisters or Believers and
[1:05:05] you feel quite good when you're out
[1:05:07] there on your own
[1:05:08] it's quite a different story yeah so
[1:05:11] that security of the church
[1:05:15] was suddenly gone when she married me
[1:05:18] you know when you get married you have
[1:05:21] other
[1:05:21] things to to contend with and you you
[1:05:25] live that secure home the secure church
[1:05:28] family or you go somewhere else and that
[1:05:31] took her overseas straight away and you
[1:05:33] know
[1:05:34] it brought out
[1:05:38] something
[1:05:40] could see where are you bornman
[1:05:43] are you in Christ oh yeah are you there
[1:05:46] or she she realized she never had a holy
[1:05:49] ghost experience
[1:05:51] she was on her knees when I uh that's
[1:05:55] about four months later
[1:05:57] crying out to the Lord Lord please save
[1:05:59] me
[1:06:00] after living A really lovely life for 18
[1:06:03] years
[1:06:05] and then the Holy Ghost came down
[1:06:07] he is so excited and besides herself it
[1:06:10] was wonderful
[1:06:11] but you see
[1:06:14] she was baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:06:17] Christ she had all these things
[1:06:21] but she didn't know where she was at
[1:06:23] you're fine
[1:06:25] they used to call her an angel in church
[1:06:28] some people said she was an angel she
[1:06:30] was so lovely I don't know how many pets
[1:06:33] she got on the shoulder I never got
[1:06:35] those but she did
[1:06:37] but you see it gives you a false
[1:06:40] security you don't need approval of man
[1:06:43] you need the proof of God
[1:06:45] and if you know where you at then when
[1:06:47] you come into a situation where you're
[1:06:49] on your own
[1:06:50] and the fear comes on you you know
[1:06:53] you're not in the right place
[1:06:55] perfect love castes out all fear so
[1:06:58] there's no fear for a Believer we should
[1:07:01] not have fear whether the Earth shakes
[1:07:04] or whether this happens we should not
[1:07:06] fear in Christ we have security we have
[1:07:09] peace we have a peace that pass all
[1:07:11] understanding so when there is fear when
[1:07:14] there is all these things
[1:07:17] where are you at yeah where are you at
[1:07:23] now
[1:07:26] what did they do the children of Israel
[1:07:28] they did fear when they came to the The
[1:07:31] Raid sea and the Egyptian Army was about
[1:07:35] to get them back their feared for their
[1:07:37] lives absolutely feared for their lives
[1:07:41] I don't think Moses feared
[1:07:43] the law promised him to be with him
[1:07:47] and they had to
[1:07:49] while they looked to Moses you know
[1:07:52] and we know the story he made a way
[1:07:55] through the trouble
[1:07:57] he didn't lift him up and and teleported
[1:08:01] him across he made a way through and
[1:08:03] sometimes you know there's a way through
[1:08:05] things they complained
[1:08:09] there were even sick of manna you know
[1:08:11] can you believe it they even complained
[1:08:13] about that they argued
[1:08:16] who should do what and Moses shouldn't
[1:08:18] do everything they doubted
[1:08:21] and the worst thing was
[1:08:24] they forgot the promise of the Lord the
[1:08:27] whole word they forgot the entering
[1:08:30] impact you see that is
[1:08:34] that that is a terrible thing and these
[1:08:36] things Bible says
[1:08:38] are written and happen for an example
[1:08:41] for us so we would not follow the way of
[1:08:45] unbelief amen Hallelujah
[1:08:49] so what I'm saying believe the whole
[1:08:51] Council of God
[1:08:53] and live by every word
[1:08:55] and you know never ever has there been a
[1:08:58] time like now you see Jesus says man
[1:09:00] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:09:02] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:09:05] mouth of God
[1:09:06] now the devil uses everything in the
[1:09:08] book in his book to attack the
[1:09:11] Christians so we need every word to
[1:09:13] combat that every word there's a word
[1:09:16] for everything I tell you that much
[1:09:20] that believe the whole word know where
[1:09:23] you are in your journey I think that is
[1:09:26] one of the most important things to know
[1:09:29] where we are at in our journey yeah
[1:09:34] you know something sometimes it's it's a
[1:09:36] it's a a little thing that we trust too
[1:09:40] much in our own program our own plans
[1:09:43] and the Lord has something else and we
[1:09:45] lose the peace
[1:09:46] what does it mean we're not necessarily
[1:09:49] not born again now suddenly no it's we
[1:09:53] can make mistakes we all constantly need
[1:09:55] to trust him do not lose sight of the
[1:09:58] promise that's the important one
[1:10:00] so you're entering to the wrist
[1:10:03] and we know the rest
[1:10:06] is
[1:10:08] the true Sabbath
[1:10:10] the Holy Ghost that's what it represents
[1:10:13] to enter into that rest
[1:10:16] and you know sometimes people follow
[1:10:19] Old Testament scriptures to the letter
[1:10:21] and have to keep the Sabbath okay if you
[1:10:25] don't worship on a Saturday oh that's
[1:10:27] the mark of the beast and you hear all
[1:10:29] that kind of stuff but
[1:10:31] have they entered into the rest
[1:10:33] have they entered into the true
[1:10:35] spiritual words into Christ
[1:10:37] I have Sabbath every day honestly every
[1:10:41] day
[1:10:42] Wednesday night as well
[1:10:44] so it's entering into that rest into the
[1:10:49] Holy Ghost into the true rest when you
[1:10:52] have entered then all fear complaints
[1:10:55] doubts and arguments are gone
[1:10:59] you will have peace the re the peace
[1:11:02] that passes all understanding I like
[1:11:04] that not all troubles and storms around
[1:11:08] you will be gone of course not but your
[1:11:10] faith will be anchored in God's word
[1:11:12] you'll overcome these things
[1:11:14] you know that makes me think it's oh
[1:11:16] sweet and we enter into the promised
[1:11:20] land now I've got the Holy Ghost now we
[1:11:22] have to fight in there we have to make
[1:11:25] sure we fight the good fight of faith
[1:11:28] and
[1:11:29] believe the word and let let not the
[1:11:32] enemy trying to rob you of of these
[1:11:35] things
[1:11:36] you know it's that is
[1:11:39] that there is so much of it says he
[1:11:42] can't just came to steal and drop and
[1:11:44] and destroy
[1:11:46] we are in that promised land and we have
[1:11:49] the victory given it's our land so we
[1:11:52] have to stand on the word of God and
[1:11:55] claim what's ours all the time all the
[1:11:57] time
[1:11:58] and we can read through the examples
[1:12:02] there
[1:12:03] uh how how they overcame the enemy you
[1:12:06] know in Supernatural ways how did the
[1:12:11] walls of Jericho fall supernaturally
[1:12:13] amen they didn't have to do anything
[1:12:15] they had to just play their trumpets at
[1:12:18] the right time
[1:12:19] and God did the rest you see it's it's
[1:12:22] incredible what happens when God's with
[1:12:25] you and we have the Lord the Holy Spirit
[1:12:28] within us and he says I will never leave
[1:12:31] you and I'll forsake you
[1:12:33] so when things go difficult
[1:12:36] can always
[1:12:37] reach out to the Lord and he is right
[1:12:40] there right there to give you the
[1:12:42] victory now I'll just uh have one or two
[1:12:45] more scriptures here
[1:12:48] acts 27
[1:12:52] verse
[1:12:54] 18 to 20.
[1:12:56] talks about
[1:12:58] um
[1:13:00] the Apostle Paul when he was on the
[1:13:03] journey
[1:13:04] he says and we being exceedingly tossed
[1:13:09] with the Tempest
[1:13:12] the next day they lightened the ship
[1:13:15] and the third day we cast out with our
[1:13:19] own hands the tackling of the ship and
[1:13:23] when now the sun no stars in many days
[1:13:27] appeared and no small Tempest lie on us
[1:13:30] all hope that we should be saved was
[1:13:34] taken away
[1:13:38] I don't know if you've ever been in a
[1:13:39] storm on a boat but this must have been
[1:13:42] terrible yeah must have been everybody
[1:13:45] thought they're dying yeah except Paul
[1:13:48] yeah why oh because he was such a good
[1:13:51] Christian no because he believed the
[1:13:54] word of God Amen and you know what the
[1:13:57] word of God told him
[1:13:59] before he boarded the ship
[1:14:02] the word of God also told him that going
[1:14:04] to be a disaster you better not you know
[1:14:06] they shouldn't sail but they did
[1:14:09] but in in Acts
[1:14:12] 23 11. it says
[1:14:15] and the night following the Lord stood
[1:14:18] by him and said be of good cheerful
[1:14:22] for as thou has testified of me in
[1:14:25] Jerusalem so must thou be witness also
[1:14:28] at Rome and he was on the journey to
[1:14:31] Rome how can you fear if you have the
[1:14:35] word of God how can he doubt even if the
[1:14:39] storm is Raging the way it did yeah that
[1:14:42] shouldn't doubt because after the word
[1:14:44] the word said you're going to be a
[1:14:46] witnessing wrong
[1:14:48] that's why it's so important that we
[1:14:50] hear from God we need to hear from God
[1:14:53] no no not from me you know there's many
[1:14:56] scriptures where where even men of God
[1:15:00] you know that they struggled with things
[1:15:02] even Paul when he had this Thorn In the
[1:15:05] Flesh he struggled he struggled and and
[1:15:08] uh he it says in the Bible he sought the
[1:15:11] Lord Thrice three times crying out to
[1:15:13] God you know Lord deliver me from this
[1:15:16] deliver me from this
[1:15:18] and he struggled with it
[1:15:21] until when until you hear from God yeah
[1:15:24] and what God Said didn't really matter
[1:15:27] it mattered that you heard it from God
[1:15:29] and he said my grace is sufficient unto
[1:15:31] you
[1:15:32] and then he said now I rejoice
[1:15:37] in persecutions I'm exceeding glad when
[1:15:41] things go go south for me you know he
[1:15:44] was because he heard it from God you
[1:15:47] can't say somebody who is in misery oh
[1:15:50] come on look at Paul you know you should
[1:15:52] not be like this and you should no you
[1:15:54] have to hear from God
[1:15:56] this is I don't want to hear from men I
[1:15:58] want to hear it from God When God says
[1:16:00] you're healed then you're healed when
[1:16:03] God speaks then you you you're actually
[1:16:06] uh you know it in your heart because we
[1:16:09] have something to respond to the word of
[1:16:11] God Amen we have a receiver
[1:16:13] yeah I don't know if she's there but
[1:16:16] about five years ago I was in a terrible
[1:16:19] mess I injured my back
[1:16:23] in a really bad way I was in such pain I
[1:16:27] don't know if you ever had back pain but
[1:16:28] it was terrible
[1:16:29] and it was over Christmas
[1:16:31] I felt myself with
[1:16:34] painkillers and that didn't work and I
[1:16:37] prayed and I cried out to God and said
[1:16:39] Lord what's wrong with my faith and you
[1:16:41] know like
[1:16:43] put all pray across on me and and every
[1:16:47] tried everything you know
[1:16:49] when you're in such pain you try
[1:16:51] everything even as a rock from Brother
[1:16:54] Brown's grave and I put that on me and
[1:16:56] didn't make any difference
[1:16:58] you know I tell you what I was in such a
[1:17:01] terrible State on the 27th of December
[1:17:04] doctors closed but there was a physio
[1:17:07] open so I went there and you know
[1:17:09] physios are not doctors and they don't
[1:17:11] x-ray or we examine you they just do
[1:17:14] whatever they think is right
[1:17:16] they squeeze so hard and so much on me I
[1:17:18] just didn't know where I was
[1:17:20] still alive or not at the end but what
[1:17:23] happened at the end
[1:17:24] did damage the nerve and that was
[1:17:26] paralyzed in my foot
[1:17:28] and I was what I couldn't lift my foot
[1:17:31] anymore I was there at the at the physio
[1:17:34] on a motorbike I went home I would try
[1:17:37] to get off I just fell over because my
[1:17:39] foot didn't work anymore so I had a drop
[1:17:41] foot I dragged my foot behind
[1:17:43] and when I told them they were in
[1:17:45] absolute shock
[1:17:47] and they
[1:17:49] organized a specialist at the Grace
[1:17:51] Hospital straight away straight away
[1:17:54] so I had to see that specialist
[1:17:57] and I prayed specifically I said Lord I
[1:18:00] don't understand it why I'm not healed
[1:18:02] but if you want me to go through the
[1:18:05] doctor then please speak through the
[1:18:08] doctor so I was listening for God to
[1:18:11] speak through the doctor
[1:18:14] so I went there he sent me through this
[1:18:16] MRI scan or whatever you call these
[1:18:19] things and had a meeting with the doctor
[1:18:21] he showed me the scan he said Mr Rook
[1:18:23] I've never seen it back that bad before
[1:18:27] all these things came out between the
[1:18:30] discs and whatever was he said I've
[1:18:32] never seen anything that bad before
[1:18:35] and as I said oh what can you do he said
[1:18:38] oh
[1:18:38] there's a you can do an operation
[1:18:42] and they said what about my paralyzed
[1:18:44] 40s there's a small chance if you do
[1:18:47] something straight away a small chance
[1:18:48] that it can come right after three
[1:18:50] months it's definitely permanent
[1:18:53] I said okay I have this operation
[1:18:56] and I was still not convinced but I did
[1:18:59] have all the
[1:19:01] the preliminaries and all these things
[1:19:03] and meetings with the doctors and anyth
[1:19:07] assists and all that they have off the
[1:19:09] um
[1:19:11] operation
[1:19:13] I went there of course you have to
[1:19:15] fasten all these things and then you put
[1:19:18] on this
[1:19:20] strange nighty and all that kind of
[1:19:22] stuff and and then they wheeled me in
[1:19:25] and then the anesthesis comes pulls down
[1:19:29] his mask and telling me that I might
[1:19:31] have a sore throat after the operation
[1:19:33] you know or the hose to put down his
[1:19:35] throat and then the doctor comes pushed
[1:19:38] down his mask pets me on the shoulder
[1:19:40] and say how are you feeling you know
[1:19:42] just trying to encourage me
[1:19:45] at the operating theater
[1:19:48] and I said I feel quite good
[1:19:51] and then he said
[1:19:54] have you got feelings touch my knee have
[1:19:56] you got feelings there
[1:19:58] I said yeah
[1:20:00] and he said can you walk he said to get
[1:20:03] off the bed and walk in this nightly up
[1:20:05] and down dragging my foot behind you
[1:20:07] know a
[1:20:10] and then it came
[1:20:13] I sat on a bed
[1:20:16] the doctor looked at me an exorcist was
[1:20:19] waiting
[1:20:20] doctor looked at me
[1:20:22] looked at me hasn't said a word then
[1:20:25] there was a strange atmosphere in the
[1:20:27] room wow
[1:20:28] then he turned his head sideways
[1:20:31] and he spoke and thou believed it was
[1:20:34] God spoken
[1:20:35] he said if I were you
[1:20:38] I would cancel this operation wow at the
[1:20:41] operating theater everything's planned
[1:20:44] done I said I'll cancel and I walked out
[1:20:49] dragging my foot behind like before got
[1:20:52] changed again and the nurse said oh what
[1:20:55] have you been doing you know they were
[1:20:56] in shook seeing me coming out there I
[1:20:59] said I've been praying and then I rang
[1:21:02] bronman she burst into tears you know
[1:21:05] she didn't need to look after me for the
[1:21:06] next three months to prop me up again
[1:21:08] you know she was in tears she picked me
[1:21:11] up
[1:21:12] I was absolutely sure I heard from God
[1:21:16] and I was rejoicing
[1:21:17] I was still crippled but I was rejoicing
[1:21:21] three days later I wake up completely
[1:21:24] healed completely healed and a week
[1:21:27] after that I played a tennis tournament
[1:21:30] and you know these people from the
[1:21:32] tennis club sent me this get well card
[1:21:34] and everybody signed and they had nearly
[1:21:37] fell over when they saw me there
[1:21:39] amen and a year later
[1:21:44] Whispering I said it was fine I'm great
[1:21:47] you know but you see I had to hear from
[1:21:50] God I didn't have to hear it even from
[1:21:53] the doctor I had to be God speaking to
[1:21:55] me otherwise it would not have triggered
[1:21:57] off something in a heart
[1:21:59] and if man means well with you and
[1:22:02] speaks to you lovely words to even
[1:22:04] retire the Bible unless God speaks
[1:22:07] through that man it will not do the same
[1:22:09] thing
[1:22:10] but when God speaks it will
[1:22:12] a witness to a man just recently and uh
[1:22:17] never met him before
[1:22:19] and then started to speak about certain
[1:22:21] things
[1:22:23] and he was exactly in that situation wow
[1:22:27] wow oh he was blown away he said I'm
[1:22:29] just going through that right now
[1:22:32] you know a week later he was in church
[1:22:34] he knew there was something and ever
[1:22:37] since he's been in contact and when they
[1:22:39] have he is just uh wants to get married
[1:22:42] or meet a girlfriend after all these
[1:22:46] years and he rang me
[1:22:49] and said can I bring my girlfriend and
[1:22:53] talk to you and get some advice
[1:22:55] you know that they knew there was
[1:22:57] something from the Lord in there
[1:22:59] and then you have confidence in that but
[1:23:02] you shouldn't have confidence in me if I
[1:23:04] haven't got to work from the Lord and
[1:23:05] you know it's just a bit of natural
[1:23:07] advice but if it's off the Lord then
[1:23:10] something will happen amen that's why
[1:23:12] it's so good to wait upon the Lord till
[1:23:14] you hear from God
[1:23:16] give you another one
[1:23:18] I was driving down Kevin Road a while
[1:23:21] ago with quite the modern car
[1:23:25] and there was this
[1:23:27] fellow
[1:23:28] sort of looked like homeless on the
[1:23:31] roadside was a bicycle wheel in the hand
[1:23:35] scruffy as can be
[1:23:37] and
[1:23:39] try to get a ride downtown somebody
[1:23:41] stole his wheel on the bike and whatever
[1:23:44] so I stopped he got it somehow into the
[1:23:47] car
[1:23:49] and he felt I don't know how he felt but
[1:23:52] I was driving along
[1:23:54] and then he said to me
[1:23:56] do you know what I've just been thinking
[1:23:58] he said
[1:24:00] it could have been the other way around
[1:24:02] could have been you standing on a
[1:24:04] roadside
[1:24:05] and I drive a flash car
[1:24:08] and I said that's right that's right we
[1:24:12] are what we are by the grace of God
[1:24:13] we're not because we we've done
[1:24:16] something special by the grace of God we
[1:24:18] have our place you know there's so many
[1:24:21] things which happened
[1:24:24] uh I I can talk to you for hours and
[1:24:27] hours about things but you know we need
[1:24:30] to hear from God we don't need we can
[1:24:33] learn things we can listen to anointed
[1:24:37] sermons which happen
[1:24:40] 50 years ago but when you need healing
[1:24:43] your name has to be called out and God
[1:24:46] has to speak to you and so many times
[1:24:49] people try to copy something or or do
[1:24:51] something and actually brings more more
[1:24:54] reproach to the word of God unto the
[1:24:56] Lord than anything else
[1:24:59] if God speaks for you then something
[1:25:02] will happen and if it's not God speaking
[1:25:04] this reason just
[1:25:06] share a few things but you may must hear
[1:25:10] from God like I said Paul was so blown
[1:25:13] away when he heard from God that he said
[1:25:16] I'm rejoicing in my infirmities a glory
[1:25:20] and persecution you think he's is he
[1:25:22] gone
[1:25:23] not now he heard from God and you know
[1:25:28] when we hear from God it's not
[1:25:30] collectively is individually
[1:25:33] if I say here I mean I can get people
[1:25:36] enthusa we are all the bride you know
[1:25:39] we're waiting for a coming of the Lord
[1:25:41] and we soon meet him in the air and we
[1:25:43] all listen we all that and hallelujah
[1:25:45] praise the Lord you know we all heard
[1:25:47] the message and well you know maybe
[1:25:49] we're not all in the same place yes I've
[1:25:52] met people they've been for 30 years or
[1:25:56] whatever in church and then suddenly had
[1:25:59] a holy ghost experience
[1:26:01] you know we need to know where we're at
[1:26:03] oh yes come on
[1:26:06] I want to know where I'm at I want to be
[1:26:08] always ready yeah you know it's not
[1:26:12] something we need to uh what do you call
[1:26:14] it
[1:26:15] fear if we if we're chosen by God and
[1:26:18] elected by God and he he he called us
[1:26:21] and we we predestinated I mean it gives
[1:26:24] you a rest and a peace but still that we
[1:26:27] are in this flesh and we need to be
[1:26:30] uh
[1:26:31] absolutely certain Where We Are
[1:26:34] I'll give you a test one more example
[1:26:36] and I heard that
[1:26:38] a while ago I've met a couple
[1:26:41] pastors
[1:26:43] overseas
[1:26:44] and
[1:26:46] next thing I mean when
[1:26:49] I always say when when people are young
[1:26:52] they had a lot of enthusiasm when they
[1:26:54] get a bit older they're looking for
[1:26:56] acceptance and when you when you get a
[1:26:58] bit older and wiser you think it's all a
[1:27:00] waste of time you know it's only God's
[1:27:03] hands anyway but you know they had a lot
[1:27:05] of competition and infighting and church
[1:27:08] splitting and everything anyway this man
[1:27:10] I visited him and had a lovely time and
[1:27:13] then I visited him again A year later
[1:27:15] and he was dying of cancer
[1:27:18] man there was no more same fellowship
[1:27:21] and there was oh nervousness and all
[1:27:23] that I just recently somebody told me he
[1:27:26] was fearful he didn't want to die and he
[1:27:29] was scared to die
[1:27:30] a pasta
[1:27:33] and then
[1:27:36] his wife was left behind and she started
[1:27:41] to
[1:27:43] I don't know what she did exactly but
[1:27:45] you know you're a widow you want to look
[1:27:47] your best to go to the gym and do all
[1:27:49] these different things and then a
[1:27:52] disease struck her
[1:27:53] she was dying and on this bed she said
[1:27:56] look
[1:27:57] I've wasted my time I've wasted so much
[1:28:00] time here is a couple preaching the
[1:28:03] message for a lifetime and come to the
[1:28:06] death beard and one is scared and the
[1:28:10] other one confesses I wasted my time
[1:28:12] we need to know where we are at before
[1:28:15] that happens oh I wanna you know I want
[1:28:19] to know where I'm at Lord if I'm not in
[1:28:22] the right place
[1:28:23] push me right there now not right now I
[1:28:26] want to be in that place where I can
[1:28:29] have absolute confidence absolute
[1:28:32] confidence God hears me God leads me
[1:28:35] there's no need of fear no need of
[1:28:37] problems if problems come well all
[1:28:40] things work together for good to them
[1:28:42] they love God and of course according
[1:28:43] his purpose doesn't mean no problems
[1:28:46] come but he cope with them you cope with
[1:28:49] them and you know you go outside of his
[1:28:52] there's a rainstorm you don't go in the
[1:28:54] corner and cry lord it's raining now you
[1:28:57] put on the rain coat go out there you
[1:29:01] know you adjust
[1:29:02] you overcome these things and I just
[1:29:06] wanted to encourage you to know be
[1:29:08] certain
[1:29:10] of your position and if your position is
[1:29:13] in Christ do you have ever the more
[1:29:16] reason to Rejoice you should never be
[1:29:18] miserable never
[1:29:20] right and if you feel down because
[1:29:22] you're looking down to look up yeah no I
[1:29:26] just want to finish with this here
[1:29:30] you see oh Paul head was the word of God
[1:29:34] to go by and that was enough there was
[1:29:37] no fear on that boat he said you'll be a
[1:29:40] witness in Rome so I believe it so
[1:29:43] that's not unto this this storm no
[1:29:45] matter how it was writing
[1:29:47] and when you were in a storm and you
[1:29:50] feel forsaken by everybody no it is it I
[1:29:54] will never leave you nor forsake you
[1:29:56] so it's absolutely wonderful so all we
[1:30:01] have to do is go by the word of God
[1:30:03] be honest with yourself
[1:30:06] where are you on your journey don't just
[1:30:09] claim to be the bride make yourself
[1:30:11] ready yeah
[1:30:13] yeah yeah yeah you know yeah
[1:30:17] absolutely absolutely I had a oh I I
[1:30:20] like to share that but I don't want to
[1:30:23] mention names but
[1:30:24] I somebody from Wellington I met him and
[1:30:29] uh
[1:30:32] he claims to be an atheist you know
[1:30:34] probably had his disappointments and all
[1:30:37] these things but last week I had a dream
[1:30:39] uh you know that sign of getting old old
[1:30:43] Mandarin dreams you know but what
[1:30:46] happened
[1:30:47] in a dream
[1:30:49] I was talking to him there
[1:30:52] and uh
[1:30:54] he said
[1:30:56] boy his wife died
[1:30:59] and being an atheist I haven't even got
[1:31:01] a father you know when you're an atheist
[1:31:03] you haven't got here Heavenly Father
[1:31:05] yeah you know in that sense
[1:31:07] and there was a huge big sliding gate
[1:31:11] coming down
[1:31:13] and he said the gates closed for me
[1:31:16] and then I threw a rock in as it came
[1:31:18] down it left a little Gap open
[1:31:21] I thought
[1:31:22] yeah never give up on people never give
[1:31:26] up on people there's this little Gap and
[1:31:29] it really struck me you know
[1:31:32] even he himself in a dream okay I don't
[1:31:35] want to say this the way it is but in a
[1:31:38] dream he had no hope no future no
[1:31:41] nothing
[1:31:42] and he saw the gate coming down closing
[1:31:45] there's no more gate is closed and
[1:31:48] that's Put a Little Rock in the left to
[1:31:50] get open and yeah you know we can do
[1:31:53] that ourselves we put that rock in there
[1:31:57] people you know you put their Rock in by
[1:31:59] prayer you put that rock in by by
[1:32:02] compassion you put that rock in there by
[1:32:04] your prayers and and faith in the Lord
[1:32:07] and I think while we're down here while
[1:32:10] there's breath there is hope you know I
[1:32:13] mean we all have children or or loved
[1:32:15] ones which not serving the lord the way
[1:32:17] they should or we have uh loved ones
[1:32:20] there religiously confused so we have
[1:32:22] all sorts
[1:32:24] but let's never give up let's never give
[1:32:26] up so I just want to finish with this um
[1:32:31] two three thoughts if you are still in
[1:32:33] Egypt enslaved
[1:32:36] drugs now calling morality hatred
[1:32:39] unbelief then press on look to God's
[1:32:43] word and receive it that's really what
[1:32:45] it is if you have heard the voice of God
[1:32:47] and you came out of Egypt and started
[1:32:50] the journey pray a song through water
[1:32:52] baptism
[1:32:54] Walking with God yes
[1:32:57] if you're at the border
[1:32:59] and you see the Giants
[1:33:01] wow if I go in there
[1:33:05] press on be a Joshua
[1:33:09] yeah just the other last week too I
[1:33:12] talked to a a man he was
[1:33:15] 29 years old
[1:33:17] rough ass
[1:33:18] and I talked to him about the things of
[1:33:21] the Lord I could see as all these
[1:33:23] tattoos but the odd one had a cross
[1:33:25] centered you know so he he swore like
[1:33:28] anything but he never misused the name
[1:33:29] of the Lord so I thought there might be
[1:33:31] something there it's just the way you
[1:33:33] talk
[1:33:34] and then I talked to him about things
[1:33:37] and then he taught me he saw like a
[1:33:41] mountain ridge
[1:33:43] and he's there I don't know how I can go
[1:33:46] to the other side
[1:33:48] and I had that same vision before I came
[1:33:50] to the Lord wow I was sitting in a
[1:33:52] church I saw myself there but I knew if
[1:33:55] I go on the other side there's no return
[1:33:59] but I said look with me I knew the love
[1:34:02] of God drew me in that's that's what it
[1:34:04] was you know I didn't want to redo it
[1:34:06] and but isn't it interesting how God can
[1:34:10] show people exactly and I knew exactly
[1:34:13] what to answer and what what what to
[1:34:15] tell them
[1:34:16] amen you see there's still hope out
[1:34:18] there for people
[1:34:22] if you are at the border and see the
[1:34:24] Giants
[1:34:27] just remember children of Israel saw the
[1:34:29] Giants
[1:34:30] and look where they all ended up
[1:34:32] fear despair misery and cast you know
[1:34:37] all died in the wilderness if you have
[1:34:40] entered into the promised land now if
[1:34:43] you have entered receive the Holy Ghost
[1:34:47] the true rest
[1:34:49] then claim your promises and fight for
[1:34:53] every inch claim your promises yes claim
[1:34:56] your promises
[1:34:59] are finished with one little story and
[1:35:01] one scripture
[1:35:03] story wise about claiming the promises I
[1:35:08] um when I was a young Christian I met
[1:35:10] this old lady and she was a Christian
[1:35:14] but she was
[1:35:16] not very confident you know you know
[1:35:18] quickly intimidated uh she had a
[1:35:21] terrible life
[1:35:23] she was married
[1:35:26] for Monday the next the husband said Lee
[1:35:28] said well I had enough and left out of
[1:35:31] nowhere
[1:35:32] unexpected she was left alone
[1:35:35] an old woman she was about 80.
[1:35:38] and I try to encourage her to have
[1:35:43] to stand on the word of God claim the
[1:35:46] promises not be timid
[1:35:50] how do you explain it to an old lady
[1:35:54] so I thought well what Lord what should
[1:35:57] I say yeah don't even think much but I
[1:36:00] made an example
[1:36:02] she lived in quite a good neighborhood
[1:36:03] and they said look
[1:36:05] Give an example if you're a neighbor
[1:36:09] will build a garage and put it across
[1:36:12] your land
[1:36:14] and deprive you of your little vegetable
[1:36:17] garden I know for your view there
[1:36:20] and do you go over there and say hey
[1:36:22] that that's that the boundary pig is
[1:36:24] still that's my lane and Hill shout and
[1:36:27] blast you you get all intimidated and go
[1:36:30] back home sit in your little house
[1:36:33] sit in your little house deprived of
[1:36:35] your little Garden on your view
[1:36:39] feeling sorry for yourself
[1:36:41] go to the council go to the lawyer get
[1:36:45] the title deed yeah
[1:36:47] get the word
[1:36:49] and go to him it is written get off my
[1:36:52] land
[1:36:53] you know this old lady
[1:36:55] she was really touched oh
[1:36:58] you know what happened
[1:36:59] the neighbor actually built the garage
[1:37:01] across her land not the entire garage
[1:37:04] but the corner of quite a big piece of
[1:37:06] it
[1:37:07] how would I know that but she heard from
[1:37:11] God that night I believe so when you
[1:37:13] hear that you can take it on board you
[1:37:16] know you can take it on board and know
[1:37:18] that the last scripture here is Joshua
[1:37:20] 13 1 we all know it
[1:37:23] now Joshua was old and stricken in years
[1:37:27] and the Lord said unto him
[1:37:29] Thou Art old and stricken in years
[1:37:33] and they remindeth yet much land to be
[1:37:37] possessed
[1:37:39] and they were in the promised land you
[1:37:42] can say they had the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:44] Ghost and still didn't walk in the full
[1:37:48] power of God as we should and I think
[1:37:52] tonight we should should say hello have
[1:37:55] I
[1:37:57] retreated to my comfortable home and and
[1:38:01] and uh where am I at am I the border am

[1:38:16] met the Heavenly broken yeah I've been
