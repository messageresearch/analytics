[0:05] Wonder.
[0:19] [Music]
[0:58] Good evening.
[1:00] How are you all? Good.
[1:05] Sorry, I'm 4 minutes late.
[1:12] I left work making my way here at uh
[1:15] 5:15, so 2 hours 15 minutes of driving
[1:19] to get here.
[1:22] Um,
[1:26] let's um, but brother I think it's
[1:28] brother Chris Andrews. He has a we'll
[1:31] call it a truth. I was going to call it
[1:33] a theory. We'll call it a truth tonight.
[1:34] We'll lean lean on his truth. He said,
[1:39] "I'm never late because Jesus is in me.
[1:42] Therefore, Jesus is never late. So if I
[1:45] arrive late somewhere, I'm bringing
[1:46] Jesus with me. And Jesus is never late.
[1:48] So I'm never late.
[1:55] That's absolutely the truth, brother.
[1:58] Let's stand up tonight.
[2:03] It was so funny. We were rushing and I
[2:04] missed this turn off to pick up some of
[2:05] the the boys and then they stay at um
[2:10] um Sister Barbara's. And I
[2:14] just went to her old place and then I
[2:16] realized it's on the other side of the
[2:17] track. So, we had to drive
[2:20] over the other side of the W and I over
[2:22] the but we had to go over the tracks and
[2:24] just when we got there there was a train
[2:25] going past
[2:27] like that the the the rails went down
[2:29] and it was a ding ding ding and we're
[2:31] waiting for the train.
[2:34] You've never seen a longer train in your
[2:35] life and I'm not kidding you. I'm not
[2:38] kidding you. And not only that, you've
[2:42] never seen a slower train like it was
[2:44] going not fast past walking pace.
[2:48] We were just sitting in the car laughing
[2:50] thinking mad.
[2:52] Well, the children were laughing at me
[2:54] cuz they could see me getting a bit
[2:55] frustrated like
[2:57] it was so funny. And then we went then
[2:59] when we came back there were bells. We
[3:01] were like another train on the same
[3:02] track. But luckily it had already been
[3:04] and they went up. Let's um pray that
[3:06] this evening. Thank you Lord that we can
[3:08] be here tonight Lord Jesus.
[3:11] We thank you Lord that you have
[3:12] everything in a perfect time. Lord, when
[3:15] you went to Lazarus, when you went to
[3:17] the tomb of Lazarus, Lord, you were, it
[3:19] was said to you, if you had have been
[3:21] here, Lord, Lazarus wouldn't have died,
[3:23] thinking, Lord, that you you'd made a
[3:24] mistake or that you were late or things
[3:26] could have been done a bit differently,
[3:27] Lord. But you've always got a perfect
[3:30] plan for everything,
[3:32] Lord. And we trust that in our lives,
[3:33] Lord, we we know that we don't
[3:36] orchestrate our steps, Lord, but the
[3:38] steps of a good man, the steps of a good
[3:39] woman are ordered of the Lord,
[3:42] Lord. Lord, and we know that your hand
[3:43] is upon each part of our life, Lord.
[3:44] That in our coming and our going, Lord,
[3:47] in our weeping and our rejoicing, Lord,
[3:49] in every part of our life, you're with
[3:50] us, Lord. And you ordain our steps. So,
[3:52] we just thank you for that. We want to
[3:53] commit this night to your hands, Lord.
[3:54] May you just bless the song service.
[3:56] Bless the ministry tonight, Lord. As we
[3:58] just come to worship you, to praise you.
[3:59] We want to drive the enemy back, Lord,
[4:01] with with praise and worship. And we
[4:02] desire, Lord, that you'll fill each one
[4:04] aresh with the Holy Ghost this evening,
[4:05] Lord. May there be a powerful outpouring
[4:07] of the Holy Ghost, Lord. May may this
[4:09] meeting not be in vain, Lord, if we just
[4:11] meet with each other and Lord, as nice
[4:13] as it is, Lord, we could just do
[4:15] something else. But we just desire,
[4:16] Lord, that you would meet with us this
[4:18] evening in a powerful way, Lord. That
[4:19] your spirit would touch each heart,
[4:21] Lord, fill each heart to overflowing,
[4:22] Lord. May we be refreshed with power,
[4:24] Lord, and refreshed by the Holy Ghost
[4:26] this evening. We just pray we just
[4:27] commit the service to you in Jesus
[4:28] wonderful name. Amen. Praise the Lord.

[4:36] lighter. Brighter is my way. It is such

[5:19] away.
[5:20] Cast him in the bottom of the sea.

[6:19] saved me. When he washed my sins away

[27:00] Let's go to Matthew chapter 11. Let's
[27:02] stand, shall we? As we just read the
[27:03] scripture and um
[27:07] just going to read uh just just these
[27:09] verses here. And um
[27:15] so I'm sure very very familiar piece of
[27:17] scripture to us all that says here,
[27:22] "Come unto me all ye that labor and are
[27:25] heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[27:28] Take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[27:30] for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[27:32] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[27:35] yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[27:39] Amen. And let's bow our heads in a word
[27:40] of prayer uh tonight. If you want to be
[27:43] remembered in prayer, just want to slip
[27:44] your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me."
[27:46] Almighty God, we just want to thank you
[27:48] so much. We can gather in this way,
[27:50] Lord, on this Wednesday night, the
[27:51] middle of the week. And we just pray,
[27:53] Father, as we have read your great word.
[27:54] We ask that you would anoint it to our
[27:56] hearts, Lord, both speaker and hearer.
[27:59] Also, those who couldn't be here
[28:00] tonight, Lord, you see many are sick and
[28:02] many things are going on. Lord, I pray
[28:03] you'd be their abundant portion as well,
[28:05] Lord. We commit our lives into your
[28:07] hands. just be glorified in our midst,
[28:08] Lord. We're so thankful we can come back
[28:10] to the heart of worship where our lives
[28:12] are all about you, Lord. So may you be
[28:14] glorified in our midst this night. We
[28:16] commit our lives into your hands, Lord.
[28:17] We pray for those, Lord, who are
[28:19] streaming. We just thank you, Lord, in
[28:21] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[28:23] bless you, friends. You can have your
[28:24] seats tonight. So, I want to I want to
[28:26] speak about rest uh rest tonight. I know
[28:29] this is probably very um uh what do you
[28:32] call it? very uh simple kind of thought
[28:34] but you know brother Bram was making I
[28:36] was uh it was interesting you know I was
[28:39] driving the youth to the node on Monday
[28:41] night for the for the song practice and
[28:43] this thought just came into my head
[28:45] about how you know brother Bram would
[28:47] make some statements and and and he
[28:49] would speak about uh how how the
[28:52] Christian he says the whole Christian
[28:54] principle is based upon rest he says he
[28:57] says he's talking to a sister and says
[28:59] you know she said brother I tell you I
[29:01] still love the Lord Jesus but said it,
[29:02] "I find it so hard to serve him." Now,
[29:05] what uh now that is what I find out
[29:08] about most Christian lives. Most I hate
[29:10] to say it that way, but it's true. The
[29:12] mo the most people that can profess
[29:14] Christianity, they seem to have such a
[29:16] hard, struggling time to hold on. I
[29:19] believe it's because of a lack of
[29:21] correct teaching of the Bible. There's
[29:22] no such thing as holding on. He's done
[29:24] the holding on. The whole Christian
[29:26] principle is based upon rest. He says,
[29:29] "Come unto me all you that are that
[29:30] labor and are heavy laden and I'll give
[29:32] you rest. Don't have to worry and
[29:34] struggle. You're just we're just you're
[29:36] just resting. That's all. Given rest.
[29:38] You enter into peace. That the whole
[29:40] thing is finished. Them who he's called,
[29:43] he is justified and those he is
[29:44] justified he has already glorified." He
[29:47] says scripture quoting the scripture. So
[29:49] he says the whole Christian principle is
[29:52] based upon rest. The whole Christian
[29:53] walk is based upon this. This is how
[29:55] important it is. True rest for the
[29:57] Christian. Now, when I talk about rest,
[29:59] I'm not talking about an idyllic scene
[30:02] where there's no trouble, there's no
[30:03] struggles, there's no hardship, it's
[30:05] just this kind of this perfect little
[30:07] bubble you live in, and it's just this
[30:09] idyllic setting. That's not the rest
[30:10] he's talking about. He's talking about
[30:12] you have a true rest in your soul, a
[30:14] peace that passes understanding that
[30:16] it's not something you manufacture, it's
[30:19] something that's God-given. Brother Bram
[30:20] says, and I think it's in why so many
[30:23] tossed about, he says there's always
[30:24] there's actually two phases of
[30:25] Christianity. The first one is
[30:27] intellectual where people strive and
[30:29] struggle and they try and push forward
[30:30] and all these things. But he said the
[30:32] other one is rest. He says it's actually
[30:34] an experience that God gives you is the
[30:36] true Christian rest. So you know a
[30:38] principle you know how he says here that
[30:40] the whole Christian principle is based
[30:42] upon rest. Now a principle is a
[30:44] fundamental truth or proposition that
[30:46] serves as the foundation of a system or
[30:49] belief or behavior or for a chain of
[30:51] reasoning. So it's the whole foundation
[30:54] of our faith is rest in Christ. It's how
[30:57] important it is.
[30:59] And um you know so so this rest that we
[31:02] talk about or or Jesus as he says I will
[31:04] give you rest. He's talking about
[31:06] receiving the true baptism of the Holy
[31:08] Ghost. Now this rest as as um uh it
[31:11] would be in the what we call the ten
[31:12] commandments is you know they were
[31:14] commanded in the Old Testament to to
[31:16] keep a day the Sabbath day. He says
[31:19] remember the Sabbath day and keep it
[31:21] holy. And six days you shall labor and
[31:23] do all thy works. For the seventh day is
[31:25] the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it
[31:27] thou shalt not do any work. Thou nor thy
[31:29] sons, nor thy daughters, thy manservant,
[31:31] nor maidervant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
[31:33] stranger that is within thy gates. For
[31:35] in six days the Lord made heaven and
[31:36] earth, the sea, and all that them all
[31:38] that in them is, and rested the seventh
[31:40] day. Wherefore the Lord blessed the
[31:42] Sabbath day, and hallowed it. So it's
[31:44] actually a big part of the commandments
[31:46] is to keep the Sabbath. Now, we we know
[31:49] already, and you I know you probably
[31:51] know where I'm going, so just just just
[31:53] walk along with me, that, you know, the
[31:55] the true rest or the true Sabbath is not
[31:58] keeping a day from sun up to sundown or
[32:00] sundown to sundown or whatever it is.
[32:02] You know, that is just a shadow pointing
[32:04] to a reality. But you see that, you
[32:07] know, a Christian who hasn't truly
[32:08] entered into rest is actually breaking
[32:10] the word, breaking the commandments.
[32:12] This is how important this is. This is
[32:13] not a nice idea. here. This is not just
[32:16] a something to put on your fridge, I'll
[32:17] give you rest. This is a reality of a
[32:19] state of being that God wants us to
[32:21] dwell in continually. I tell you what,
[32:23] friends, when you truly enter into rest,
[32:25] you can't get out of it cuz it's it's a
[32:28] condition God puts you in. And it's not
[32:30] based on circumstances, not based on
[32:32] time of life or situation of life. It's
[32:34] far transcends that because you've
[32:36] entered into true spiritual rest. Now,
[32:40] um, as I said, it's just a shadow
[32:41] pointing to the reality. We could just
[32:43] read here um Hebrews chapter 4. You read
[32:45] Hebrews 3 and 4 and the Apostle Paul
[32:47] talks about this. He says, "For he spake
[32:49] in a certain place on the seventh day on
[32:51] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[32:53] day from all his works and in this place
[32:55] again if they shall enter into my rest
[32:57] seeing therefore it remainth that some
[32:59] must enter therein and they to whom it
[33:02] was first preached entered not in
[33:03] because of unbelief." Now this is the
[33:05] big key. You enter in because of faith.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; It is faith that gets you in. It's not
[33:11] how much you shout. It's not how the
[33:13] emotion you feel. It's not how much you
[33:15] pound on the altar and all those things.
[33:17] Faith can lead you to do those things,
[33:20] but it's not it's not that thing that
[33:22] causes rest to come into your life. It's
[33:24] like blind Barameus. You know, it said
[33:26] that he screamed all the more louder
[33:28] when the people you know when Jesus was
[33:29] going by and you know the you know the
[33:31] people told him to be quiet when he
[33:33] found out it was it was the son of
[33:34] David. He was crying out son of David
[33:36] have mercy on me. And you know he he was
[33:38] told to be quiet and he said he screamed
[33:40] all the more. Now Jesus, brother Bram
[33:42] said, did not hear his vocals, did not
[33:44] hear his noise of his lips, of his cry.
[33:46] He heard his faith and his faith caused
[33:49] the master to stop still. Sure, the
[33:52] manifestation of it was the cry, but it
[33:54] wasn't the cry that stopped the master.
[33:56] It was his faith. You see, so it's
[33:59] really our faith that gets a hold of
[34:01] God. It's not necessarily the outward
[34:04] appearance of it. Though, you know, if
[34:06] you feel led to cry, cry. If you feel
[34:09] led to fast, fast. Right? If you feel
[34:12] led, but we can't humanly manufacture
[34:14] these things. We just got to rest in God
[34:16] that God will lead us. Amen. So, I trust
[34:19] that is in balance, right? Because you
[34:21] because some people say, "Oh, I'm
[34:22] resting. Therefore, I don't need to do
[34:23] anything." Well, you've got to let the
[34:25] faith of the son of God that comes into
[34:27] you when you rest rule your life. that
[34:29] if he leads you to cry or fast or pray
[34:32] or strive or whatever it is, well, it
[34:35] may look like it, but that's faith
[34:38] ruling your life, right? But it can look
[34:41] the same thing without that rest, but it
[34:43] doesn't produce the same results.
[34:47] He says here now um again he limited the
[34:50] certain day, saying in David, today
[34:51] after so long a time, as it is said,
[34:54] today if you'll hear his voice, harden
[34:55] not your hearts. For if Jesus had given
[34:57] them rest, then he would not have um not
[34:59] afterward have spoken of another day.
[35:02] There there remainth therefore a rest to
[35:04] the people of God. For he that has
[35:06] entered into his rest, he has also
[35:07] ceased from his own works as God did
[35:09] from his. Let us labor therefore to
[35:11] enter into that rest, lest any man fall
[35:14] after the same example of unbelief. Now,
[35:17] it's faith that causes you because as
[35:19] soon as we talk about labor, soon as we
[35:21] talk about, you know, striving or or
[35:23] pressing into something, we think
[35:25] normally people think of a human ability
[35:27] to cause us to get into it. Like the
[35:29] Bible says, the violent take the kingdom
[35:30] by force. What is that by strength? You
[35:33] know, what does that what does that
[35:34] really mean? It's by faith. You're not
[35:37] willing to take no for an answer. That's
[35:40] violent to me in the kingdom of God. You
[35:42] see a promise and you're like, "Lord, I
[35:44] believe that promise is mine." And you
[35:47] claim it in faith. However that
[35:48] manifests, it's up to you. It's up to
[35:50] how God leads you rather. But it's not
[35:52] your physical things that you know
[35:54] because many people have sadly become
[35:55] very disappointed even even in the
[35:58] message where they've well I've kept the
[36:00] word and I've done all I can, but
[36:02] they've done it humanly without entering
[36:04] into rest. Because when you enter into
[36:06] rest, that's when God starts to work on
[36:08] your behalf like never before. It's like
[36:10] when Naomi lay at Boaz's feet there on
[36:12] the threshing floor and then and then
[36:14] and then they have a conversation and
[36:16] you know and then Boaz gives gives Ruth
[36:18] the six measures of barley. She goes
[36:20] back to Naomi and then Naomi says to
[36:22] Ruth that he will not rest until he has
[36:25] done what he's promised to do to you
[36:26] which is marry you. Right? So when so
[36:29] when Ruth stopped you know laboring in
[36:31] the field but rested at the feet of Boaz
[36:34] then she was rewarded later. Right? by
[36:36] the union to Boaz, the son, the red
[36:39] redemption of Naomi's land, all those
[36:40] things. But see, when she entered into
[36:42] rest, then Boaz could do what only Boaz
[36:45] could do. And when we enter into rest,
[36:47] when we truly receive the Holy Ghost,
[36:49] then God can act on our behalf like only
[36:52] he can.
[36:54] All right? Amen. Paul would say again,
[36:56] let no man therefore judge you in meat
[36:58] or in drink or in respect of a holy day
[36:59] or the new moon or the Sabbath days,
[37:01] which are a shadow of things to come,
[37:04] but the body is of Christ. So he's
[37:05] saying here very clearly it's not about
[37:07] keeping a day. Brother Ram says the true
[37:10] Sabbath is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:12] where you cease from your works trying
[37:15] to be a Christian trying to follow the
[37:17] Lord. Then when the Lord steps into you
[37:19] then it's no longer you trying to do it.
[37:22] He changes your nature. He comes and
[37:23] dwells in you and he lives the Christian
[37:25] life out of you. Sure, you've got to
[37:28] stay surrendered to him because this old
[37:29] nature is still around. But it's him
[37:31] doing the works if you stay surrendered
[37:32] to him, right? So, but it's God being
[37:34] the Christian. Now, he would say about
[37:36] the true rest here. Isaiah would
[37:37] prophesy it. He said, he said, "For with
[37:40] stammering lips and another tongue will
[37:41] he speak to this people to whom he said,
[37:43] this is the rest wherein wherein ye may
[37:46] cause the weary to rest, and this is the
[37:48] refreshing, yet they would not hear."
[37:50] So, what happened on the day of
[37:51] Pentecost? God came down and gave them
[37:53] the rest. They were stammering lips and
[37:56] other tongues. These people acting like
[37:57] drunkards. What's going on? They can't
[37:59] get their words out right. But yet
[38:01] they're being heard in every language
[38:02] that was assembled. And you know, there
[38:04] are stammering lips in another tongue.
[38:05] Says, "This is the rest." Amen. And this
[38:07] is why Peter could say to them, "No,
[38:09] this is that spoken by the prophet Joel.
[38:11] I'll pour my spirit out upon my
[38:13] handmmaids and my sons and daughters
[38:15] shall prophesy. I will dwell in them."
[38:18] Amen. So the Christian faith is based
[38:21] solidly upon rest. Because if you really
[38:24] realize that the Lord is your shepherd
[38:26] and he is the door to the sheepfold that
[38:29] he that nothing can actually go past him
[38:33] without his permission against your
[38:35] life. Amen. Because remember the devil
[38:37] wants to the devil wants to prove to God
[38:40] that his rest does not work. But he
[38:42] knows but our God knows very well. His
[38:44] rest works incredibly well. Right? So
[38:46] there's so so when we truly enter into
[38:48] rest and trouble comes we're not
[38:51] guessing. We're not worried in terms of
[38:53] Lord, am I saved? Lord, what's happening
[38:55] is my salvation. Do I really have it?
[38:57] No, you're resting because he's given
[38:59] you such an experience. He's changed
[39:01] your heart. We realize, Lord, it's no
[39:03] longer me. It's all of you. And nothing
[39:06] can come against you unless he has
[39:08] permitted it. Remember, the devil has to
[39:10] ask permission for everything that he
[39:13] comes against you with. And God sets
[39:15] parameters. He sets a boundary. And the
[39:17] devil cannot overstep the word of God of
[39:20] the of the permission that God has given
[39:22] him. Amen. That's why you know when you
[39:24] know when Satan came up before God spoke
[39:26] about Job, God gave Satan specific
[39:29] parameters about Job the first time.
[39:32] Don't touch him. Job wasn't touched,
[39:35] right? Then then Satan goes up a second
[39:37] time and God basically says, I tell you
[39:39] told you so. Cuz God can see the future.
[39:41] He knows what's going to happen, right?
[39:42] And then and then well Satan says,
[39:44] "Well, the only reason is cuz he's got
[39:45] his health." And then what did God say?
[39:47] You can touch him, but don't take his
[39:49] life. He didn't die. You see, certain
[39:52] parameters were set by God. So, we got
[39:54] to realize that everything that happens
[39:56] against us by the enemy is not because
[39:59] we're weak in faith. It's not because
[40:01] God is even mad at us or displeased or
[40:03] anything. No, we're his children. He
[40:05] can't change his mind about us. It's
[40:07] because it's because the devil's come
[40:09] against us and try, you know, and God
[40:11] has permitted it. Well, why on earth
[40:14] should this trial hit me? God wants to
[40:16] show something of himself.
[40:18] Everything that happens in our lives,
[40:20] God will get glory for. I mean, even
[40:23] maybe not if maybe even not on this
[40:25] side, but on the other side, God will
[40:28] show you why. And you'll say, "That
[40:29] makes absolute sense." And you'll give
[40:31] him glory for the things you don't
[40:32] understand.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, that's why I see the Christian
[40:35] faith is based solidly upon rest. It's
[40:38] not about, you know, it's not about
[40:40] whether you hold on or not. He holds on
[40:42] to you. I'm sure we've all come to a
[40:45] stage in our walk where we want to quit.
[40:48] Let's be honest. I've been there. But
[40:50] something within me says, "I cannot
[40:52] quit. I'm not made of material that can
[40:54] quit. I just don't know. It doesn't make
[40:56] sense to me. It doesn't, you know, the
[40:58] you know, the reasoning of the enemy
[40:59] just kind of lines up and yeah, I could.
[41:01] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that works. And yeah,
[41:02] sure, I'm going to quit. But something
[41:03] in me says I can't. Why? Because I've
[41:06] entered into by God's supreme grace,
[41:08] I've entered into rest, right? where
[41:11] where God there's actually like he says
[41:12] he says here a Christian is not tossed
[41:14] about a Christian doesn't run from place
[41:17] to place a Christian doesn't fuss and
[41:19] fume oh she said this and he said this
[41:22] and they did this and we don't fuss and
[41:24] fume we're not in the business of fuming
[41:26] and fussing let the devil fuss and fume
[41:29] but we don't fuss and fume amen we don't
[41:31] run from place to place and you know we
[41:33] don't worry about things
[41:35] you know have you ever really really you
[41:37] know you're going through a big thing
[41:38] something's happening and it's all in
[41:40] your mind like this big massive thing.
[41:42] But when really you think about it,
[41:43] there's something within you says it's
[41:44] just fine. Have you ever kind of just
[41:47] sat back taken stock of everything and
[41:49] you realize actually everything's fine.
[41:51] This this this mind battle is just a
[41:53] mind battle. It's not really who I am.
[41:54] Who's had that kind of experience? I
[41:56] mean that shows that you your soul
[41:58] doesn't worry. The real you doesn't
[42:00] worry, right? Because I want you to know
[42:02] just because you've entered into rest
[42:03] doesn't mean you don't have mind
[42:05] battles. Doesn't mean you don't have
[42:06] attacks. You'll have them. But there's a
[42:07] rest in your soul. There's an anchor.
[42:09] Amen. There's a firm foundation that
[42:11] cannot be moved. Nothing can move it.
[42:13] Nothing can destroy it. Nothing can make
[42:15] it budge. Not for a second. There may be
[42:17] something going on in here that can
[42:18] move. But in here, there's an immovable
[42:20] rock. Amen. That cannot cannot be moved.
[42:23] Amen. Why? Because you've entered into
[42:25] rest. You're not hoping it's going to
[42:27] work out. You just know God's going to
[42:29] work it out for your good.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; There's something in you when you really
[42:32] take stock. This is working for my good.
[42:34] God's going to get the glory out of it.
[42:36] The devil's going to get no credit. and
[42:38] it's all going to work out fine. You
[42:40] don't know how it is going to work out
[42:41] because that's God's problem, right? He
[42:44] takes care of the details. All we need
[42:46] to do is rest in his ability, rest in
[42:48] his word and know he's more than able to
[42:50] do it. Amen. That's why a Christian
[42:53] rests. Amen. It's all over when it was
[42:55] uh it was all finished for the believer
[42:57] at Calvary. That's right. Oh, sickness
[42:59] may come and disappointments.
[43:02] But the Christian is at rest knowing
[43:04] this that God is able to keep that which
[43:07] he has performed. Amen. Knowing that no
[43:10] matter what the thing is and how it
[43:12] looks that there's neither sickness,
[43:14] sorrow, death, there's neither
[43:15] starvation or anything that can separate
[43:16] us from the love of God that's in Jesus
[43:19] Christ. We're at rest. Just let the old
[43:21] ship toss any way she wants to. The
[43:23] anchor holds. Amen. I tell you, when a
[43:26] believer is at rest, that anchor is not
[43:28] made out of a human reasoning that can
[43:30] be broken. And it's made out of an
[43:32] unbreakable chain of revelation of God's
[43:35] word of his power. Amen. So, you know,
[43:38] there's just something because really
[43:39] for a believer, the thing that concerns
[43:41] us the most when you really give your
[43:42] life to the Lord is Lord, am I one with
[43:44] you? That's all you really care about,
[43:46] right? And that's so, so what happens is
[43:48] the enemy tries to bring things in to
[43:50] make us think there could be something
[43:51] that separates us, but nothing does.
[43:54] We're at rest.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The anchor holds. Amen.
[43:59] It's like, you know, Brother Ram would
[44:00] tell a story of a boy and he's flying a
[44:02] kite and you know, there's low cloud and
[44:04] the kite goes way up into the clouds and
[44:06] the boy's just there with the string and
[44:08] you know, some some friends come along
[44:10] and say, "Jimmy, what are you doing?
[44:11] What are you doing?" He says, "I'm
[44:12] flying a kite." And they and they look
[44:13] at him, they look at the and they can't
[44:15] see a kite cuz it's in the clouds. And
[44:17] you know, and they ask him, "Jimmy, how
[44:18] do you know there's a kite there?" He
[44:19] says, "Well, I feel the pull. I feel the
[44:22] tug." Amen. It's like the same thing.
[44:23] There can be storm clouds of trouble and
[44:25] sorrows and things that seem to obscure
[44:27] the Lord. But you feel this tug. You
[44:29] feel that there's no slack on the line,
[44:31] but there's a pull. Amen. There's a
[44:32] connection. I mean, between you and the
[44:34] Lord. Praise the Lord. You see, now when
[44:37] God when God uh gives his word to us, we
[44:41] can rest in it. Amen. It's like Mary,
[44:45] when Mary was told by the angel Gabriel,
[44:47] you're going to have the Messiah. And
[44:49] you know, he, you know, he, you know,
[44:51] she says to him, how can this be? uh you
[44:53] know I don't know a man how's this going
[44:55] to happen now humanly there'd be a lot
[44:57] of pressure imagine if humanly someone
[44:59] came to her and said you're going to
[45:00] have the Christ she'd be thinking how am
[45:03] I going to do this and how's this going
[45:04] to work and all this human reasoning but
[45:06] when the when the angel gave the word to
[45:08] her and he said you're going to have the
[45:11] child by the Holy Ghost something
[45:12] anchored within her without feeling
[45:15] anything nothing about a baby nothing at
[45:17] all she said let it be unto me according
[45:19] to thy word and she entered into rest
[45:22] that God was able to produce the Messiah
[45:25] within her womb. Amen. It should be the
[45:27] same thing with you and I when God gives
[45:28] you a promise more than more than just a
[45:31] nice idea, but God anchors his word.
[45:33] That's why it's so important. Always
[45:35] feed on the word of God, listen to the
[45:38] message, read the word, meditate upon
[45:41] it, think about it. Amen. and God
[45:42] because you're giving God something to
[45:44] work with that he can anchor that word
[45:46] from your mind into your heart and then
[45:48] it becomes a living reality and then you
[45:50] can rest. Lord, what you have promised
[45:51] me about this specific circumstance,
[45:54] you're going to fulfill it.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like, you know, Caleb and
[45:59] Joshua, Caleb and Joshua, when God
[46:01] called them out of Egypt and God be to
[46:04] give them promises, I'm going to take
[46:06] you to me for a people, and I and and
[46:08] and I'll be um and I Now, notice this
[46:11] about the I wills in this sentence. Just
[46:12] just look at the I wills. I wanted to
[46:14] highlight them, make them bigger, but
[46:16] just look at this. I will take you to me
[46:19] for a people, and I will be to you a
[46:21] god, and you shall know that I am the
[46:23] Lord your God, which bringeth you out
[46:25] from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
[46:27] and I will bring you uh in unto the land
[46:30] concerning the which I did swear to give
[46:32] it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
[46:34] and I will give it you for an
[46:36] inheritance. I am the Lord. Caleb and
[46:40] Joshua, when they heard those words,
[46:41] they entered into rest because it was a
[46:43] revelation to them. I mean, they
[46:45] weren't, you know, when they went in and
[46:47] spied out the land, they acknowledged
[46:49] the problems. They acknowledged the
[46:51] giants. They acknowledged the same
[46:52] things the other 10 spies did. But
[46:54] because they entered into rest, they
[46:56] were not wondering if they could take it
[46:58] because the other spies, they weren't in
[47:00] rest. They were looking at human
[47:02] ability. And this is what happens. You
[47:04] see, a Christian that looks at looks at
[47:06] things and doesn't believe the promise
[47:08] is theirs, they're looking at their own
[47:09] human ability. But Caleb and Joshua
[47:12] weren't looking at themselves. They've
[47:13] entered into rest. and something
[47:14] anchored in their the word of God
[47:16] anchored in their heart saying God has
[47:18] brought us out. He's going to take us
[47:20] in. He doesn't do a halfway job. I'm
[47:22] resting Lord and what you have said we
[47:25] will possess. Amen. And that's why I say
[47:27] it's so important to read the word,
[47:28] listen to the message, ponder it,
[47:30] meditate upon it that God can take that
[47:32] and anchor it into your soul and then
[47:34] you can realize what the Lord has
[47:36] promised it to me. It's going to happen.
[47:38] I'm resting in God in his season. He
[47:40] will fulfill that word.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then then you're no longer
[47:44] tossed about. You just know it's going
[47:46] to happen. When is when is it going to
[47:47] happen? In God's timing, it's going to
[47:49] happen. But he gave me a revelation that
[47:52] it's going to happen. Amen. is like
[47:54] Abraham and Abraham and Sarah, you know,
[47:56] there was there was a time, you know,
[47:58] they would um if I can find it here, you
[48:02] know, there was a time if we read this
[48:04] in um Hebrews 11, he says, "Through
[48:07] faith also Sarah herself received
[48:09] strength to conceive seed and was
[48:11] delivered of a child when she was past
[48:13] age because because she judged him
[48:15] faithful who had promised." Now before
[48:18] this, Sarah was not in rest, right? This
[48:22] is this is when did she judge him
[48:24] faithful? This is in Genesis 18 when
[48:26] when the Lord put on human flesh and
[48:28] came down and spoke to Abraham and Sarah
[48:30] because God because one of them which
[48:32] was the Lord said according to time of
[48:34] life you'll have the promised son. He
[48:36] was speaking to Abraham but he wasn't
[48:37] referring to him because time of life
[48:39] refers to a woman right and then so now
[48:41] she laughed in her heart saying how
[48:43] could this be? We're old. How can I
[48:44] pleasure with my lord? And then then the
[48:46] Lord knew what she was thinking. Said
[48:47] why did Sarah laugh? And you see, God
[48:50] gave that supernatural visitation that
[48:53] that that what what Abraham was telling
[48:55] her for so many years about having a
[48:57] promised son. You see, before that, she
[49:00] would have believed him mentally. Yes,
[49:02] we're going to have a son. But you see,
[49:04] what happens is someone who's not in
[49:06] rest, they become frustrated the longer
[49:08] time seems to go and there seems to be a
[49:10] delay. They become frustrated. They
[49:12] become annoyed. They just get so annoyed
[49:14] at that promise because they don't see
[49:16] it being fulfilled in their lives.
[49:18] They're not in rest yet. It's still
[49:19] mentally what can I do to bring the
[49:22] promised word to pass.
[49:25] But she came to a place basically where
[49:28] where she would have said I don't want
[49:30] to hear about this Abraham anymore.
[49:33] God but God when she was in that state
[49:37] already had her as Abraham's wife that
[49:40] through her and Abraham the promised son
[49:42] was going to come. So her state did not
[49:45] stop her being part of this promise that
[49:47] we're going to have the promised son,
[49:48] right? But brother Bram said that
[49:49] Abraham kept a spiritual atmosphere
[49:51] around him because he had it anchored in
[49:54] her in his heart that through her
[49:57] they're going to have Isaac cuz Abraham
[50:00] had entered into rest. Now she just
[50:01] needed sorry he just needed Sarah to
[50:04] enter into that same rest. So but what
[50:06] did it require? A visitation from
[50:09] Elohim. Amen. for her to then come to a
[50:13] place where she judged him faithful who
[50:15] had promised. You see, this is what
[50:17] revelation does. Now, she entered into
[50:20] rest, you know, when this happened
[50:22] because she wasn't now trying to trying
[50:24] to manufacture a promised son. She
[50:27] wasn't looking at the state of her own
[50:29] self, a grandma well up in years,
[50:32] Abraham nearly 100 years old. You know,
[50:34] we know, we all know the story, don't
[50:36] we? You know, it was physically
[50:37] impossible for them to have the son. But
[50:39] then when faith was anchored into her
[50:41] heart, she entered into rest because she
[50:43] realized, God, you promised it, you're
[50:45] going to do it. Amen. And this is what
[50:48] happens when we enter into rest about
[50:49] any promise. We realize, no, God, you're
[50:52] more than able to do it. I judge you
[50:54] faithful. Amen. I believe the bride of
[50:57] Jesus Christ in this day judges him
[51:00] faithful. Amen. Why? Because God is
[51:02] going to make our us. He's going to get
[51:05] he's given us a faith. Amen. that we
[51:07] have a change of the body and we go on
[51:09] the rapture. This is the season of that
[51:10] faith and a visitation of Elohim in this
[51:13] day has done that. We judge him
[51:15] faithful. Oh, the world's falling apart.
[51:17] But Lord, you're faithful. I'm resting.
[51:19] I'm resting in the chaos. I'm resting in
[51:21] the uncertainty. I'm resting in the
[51:23] world falling apart. How can you do
[51:24] that? Is it because you got blinkers on?
[51:26] Oh, no. I see more than anyone else.
[51:28] Well, then why? Because I judge him
[51:31] faithful. There's something in me that
[51:33] I've entered into rest.
[51:37] Amen.
[51:40] This is you I was thinking about you
[51:41] talking about the train Isaac and how
[51:42] slow and how long and all these things.
[51:44] You know, brother Bram says that there's
[51:46] nothing happens by chance to you and I.
[51:50] It's not random probability that certain
[51:52] events happen in our lives. God has
[51:54] allowed it all. We should be resting in
[51:57] that. Especially in the unexpected
[52:00] things, we should rest in those things.
[52:02] Amen.
[52:04] Praise the Lord. Now,
[52:06] but you see what happens is
[52:09] when when we enter into rest, we become
[52:13] certain like brother preacher uh sermon,
[52:16] be certain of God. Okay? Because now
[52:19] we're in a different state than we were
[52:21] before we entered into rest because we
[52:22] know God is. He's more than able and
[52:25] we've committed our whole life into his
[52:27] hands. And we're not trying to
[52:29] manufacture or produce the promises in
[52:31] our own strength. We know it's his
[52:33] ability in us which will do it. Okay. So
[52:36] he says now he says this. He says now
[52:39] I'm sure that I'm speaking to people
[52:41] this morning or so this evening who has
[52:42] come to that place. I've been there many
[52:44] times myself. When I've went back and
[52:46] traced my life and turned over every
[52:48] stone I find out that I've done
[52:49] something wrong. I'd go confess it and
[52:51] say Lord I'll make that right and go do
[52:53] so. Then come back again and say now
[52:55] Lord thou art God. You'll answer me. yet
[52:58] I've met every request that you required
[53:00] me to do and every requirement I have
[53:02] met it and silly won't move um seems to
[53:04] be silent. That's when you got to be
[53:06] sure that he is God. Amen. And we know
[53:09] God is not an author of confusion. Those
[53:12] who are at rest know if there's
[53:14] something you need to put right, you ask
[53:15] God, God will show you. We don't need to
[53:18] imagine something to do. God tells you,
[53:21] I trust you've had that experience. They
[53:23] say, "Lord, is there anything?" He says,
[53:24] "Such and such and such. Thank you,
[53:26] Lord." and then you put it right or what
[53:28] do you need to do and then you move
[53:29] forward. Right? You're not trying to
[53:30] imagine something. God tells you. Amen.
[53:33] He reveals it to you. But you see
[53:35] sometimes, see someone who's at rest is
[53:37] when it appears God doesn't move and
[53:39] he's silent. God, they're resting in
[53:42] God's silence. You say, "How could that
[53:44] be?" Because it's normally in times of
[53:46] great crisis where we need an answer.
[53:48] But yet, we got to but rest is greater
[53:51] than God answering all the time.
[53:53] Remember our our faith is not based on
[53:55] how quickly we get a we get a search
[53:58] result, an answer. You know, like
[54:00] Google, it says how long it takes, how
[54:01] many answers in this much time. And you
[54:03] know, sometimes God, you know, God's not
[54:05] like that. But someone who's at rest,
[54:08] they say, "Well, have you got an answer
[54:09] yet?" No. Are you worried? No. Why are
[54:12] you indifferent? No. I know God will
[54:14] answer. I know that God is more than
[54:17] able. And even in his silence, I'm
[54:19] trusting He is still present, which he
[54:21] is. He my life in his is in his hands
[54:24] which it is and he's working this for my
[54:26] good. Amen. Sometimes we we will feel
[54:30] alone.
[54:32] That doesn't mean God's left you.
[54:33] Remember we don't go by feelings. Rest
[54:35] is not a feeling.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; It's a state of being. Right? It's not
[54:39] an emotion. It's a state of being. Amen.
[54:42] So don't be discouraged. The only thing
[54:44] that in your heart is be certain of God.
[54:48] Amen. And when you've met everything
[54:50] that he said that you're sure that he's
[54:52] God. And when faith goes to work right
[54:54] there, faith stands steady for it knows
[54:56] that he is. Amen. It's the kind of faith
[54:59] we possess. He we know that he is. We
[55:02] know he's always on the throne. He's
[55:03] always in control. We don't. And and
[55:05] this is not just some fatalistic idea of
[55:07] what will be, what will be. We know God
[55:10] is in control of all things.
[55:12] Amen. He says, "And you've met every
[55:15] requirement. You believe that he is and
[55:16] faith holds steady." And I don't have it
[55:18] here. You go listen to this message. He
[55:20] says, "Meeting every requirement is Acts
[55:22] 238." Just like full obedience to the
[55:25] full word of God entitles you to the
[55:27] token. Who's heard that phrase? Do you
[55:28] know what that full obedience to the
[55:30] full word of God is? Acts 238. It's what
[55:33] the prophet teaches us. It's so simple.
[55:35] It's not some scarecrow thing of I've
[55:37] been good enough for long enough and
[55:39] I've done this and I've listened this
[55:40] much and done all these humanistic
[55:42] works. No, it's repent and be baptized
[55:44] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[55:46] remission of sin and you shall receive
[55:48] the token, the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[55:50] Amen.
[55:52] Praise the Lord. He That's how he
[55:54] teaches it. Amen. Now, you may go down
[55:56] deep and never wait, sorry. He says,
[55:59] "And you meet every requirement you
[56:00] believe that he is. Faith holds steady.
[56:02] Oh, blessed be his name. Faith won't
[56:04] move, for it's sure that God is and a
[56:06] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[56:08] him." May this go way down deep and
[56:10] never move from you, Bram Tabernacle. If
[56:12] you've met God's requirements and in
[56:13] your heart you believe that he is, God's
[56:15] only testing your faith for he loves to
[56:16] do that. You've confessed your sin and
[56:18] you've met every requirement that God
[56:20] requires and still he lays silent.
[56:22] Remember, faith says that he is. Then
[56:24] faith holds on to it. Not uh uh not
[56:27] knowing what it's all about, but it
[56:29] knows that he is and it's certain that
[56:31] he is. So when you're at rest, you know
[56:33] God is my savior. He's my shepherd.
[56:37] Everything that happens to me, as I said
[56:39] earlier, is permitted by him. He's my
[56:41] good shepherd. I'm never out of his
[56:43] care. Doesn't matter if I'm standing in
[56:44] the midst of a pack of demons, a pack of
[56:46] wolves. Amen. My shepherd is watching me
[56:49] and he's a present help in time of
[56:50] trouble. That's why we don't see rest is
[56:54] not based on what your five senses
[56:55] declare.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's based on revelation. It's not
[57:00] based on what you see, what you hear,
[57:01] what you feel, what you taste, smell,
[57:03] any of those things. What you reason,
[57:04] your conscience, your imagination,
[57:06] affection, any of those things. It's not
[57:08] based on that. The rest is based on the
[57:10] revelation of the word. God has revealed
[57:12] to you that you are his child. He's
[57:16] revealed Jesus Christ to you. Amen.
[57:20] Because remember, he can't lose one of
[57:22] his. He cannot. That's the one thing.
[57:25] God can't lie. He can't lose a part of
[57:26] himself. Amen. That gives you rest.
[57:31] Amen. Now,
[57:34] let's just So, I'm just going to I won't
[57:36] be too much longer. I've just got a few
[57:38] more quotes here. He says, "You look
[57:39] back. I'm doing this and I'm doing
[57:41] that." Then know you're you're defeated.
[57:44] See, the enemy, what he wants to do is
[57:46] get your eyes off your shepherd, your
[57:49] source of rest. He is the rest within
[57:50] you. Get your eyes off him and get your
[57:52] eyes on yourself. Because remember,
[57:54] that's been the failure of human
[57:56] religion has been it's man-made works.
[57:59] Earn something with God.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; We don't need to earn anything with the
[58:03] Lord. He earned it all that day on
[58:05] Calvary. Faith in the finished work of
[58:07] God, the prophet says, unlocks every
[58:09] divine promise.
[58:11] That's okay. That's how simple it is.
[58:15] You You got a promise in the word that
[58:17] you want to see manifested in your life.
[58:19] Faith and the finished work of Calvary
[58:22] opens that promise to you. Amen. Oh, but
[58:26] don't I have to do X, Y, and Zed? All
[58:28] these things. We don't have to go on
[58:30] pilgrimages. We We don't have to do
[58:32] penance. We don't have to do some
[58:33] humanistic ritual to try and earn
[58:35] something with God. No, we are accepted
[58:38] in the beloved. Amen. The beloved is
[58:40] Christ. He was accepted and we're
[58:42] accepted in him. It's nothing. You say,
[58:44] "Well, then what's the point of trying?"
[58:46] If you're resting like Caleb was, then
[58:50] if you're resting, you realize every
[58:51] promise is mine.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; God says, "I give it to you. Just go
[58:55] fight." You've got to show up to the
[58:56] battle like brother Armander said many
[58:57] times, you know, but but you're resting
[59:00] in the fact God's given me the promise.
[59:01] Whatever the obstacle is in the way, I'm
[59:03] resting in the fact that when I come to
[59:05] that obstacle, it's going to fall
[59:07] because God has anoint has anointed me
[59:10] that it will fall.
[59:12] Amen. But there's no condemnation to
[59:14] them which are in Christ Jesus that walk
[59:16] not after the flesh but after the
[59:18] spirit. Then you realize that you've
[59:20] overcome and you know that he's a devil.
[59:22] You can't say, "I've got a sickness and
[59:24] I don't believe it's a sickness." Oh
[59:25] yes, it's a sickness. You've got cancer.
[59:27] You don't believe it's a cancer. It's a
[59:29] cancer. It's a cancer. But remember
[59:31] remember this. Greater is he that's in
[59:33] you than he that's in the world. You
[59:35] must realize that the Holy Spirit that's
[59:37] in you has already overcome this thing.
[59:40] See that's resting. When you realize the
[59:41] one in you has already conquered this
[59:43] foe. He's already conquered this spirit.
[59:45] He's already conquered this problem.
[59:46] Doesn't matter if it's some human thing
[59:49] passed down through family lines and all
[59:51] these things. God conquered it.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter what it is. God's
[59:55] taking care of it. sickness, sorrow,
[59:56] pain, whatever it is, God has already
[59:58] overcome this thing. Amen. He says, "You
[1:00:01] must realize the Holy Spirit that's in
[1:00:02] you has already overcome this thing and
[1:00:04] he's in you and you can overcome by
[1:00:07] him." He says, "That's exactly
[1:00:09] sensible." It's exactly the way the
[1:00:11] scriptures written, overcoming.
[1:00:14] Why? Because you're resting.
[1:00:16] The one enemy has already conquered it.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; I don't need to strive. I don't need to
[1:00:21] be anxious. I don't need to be worried.
[1:00:23] I just cast my cares upon him. I mean,
[1:00:26] because he cares for me and I know God
[1:00:28] in his time will answer and God in his
[1:00:30] time will move on my behalf. I'm resting
[1:00:32] in that fact.
[1:00:34] Amen.
[1:00:38] And the sound system said, "Amen, too."
[1:00:41] But Jesus didn't come down just to die
[1:00:42] for us or die for you. He settled the
[1:00:45] sin question. See, when you realize,
[1:00:47] see, see when Jesus hung on Calvary, he
[1:00:50] said, "It is finished."
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Right? So in God's mind, it was done.
[1:00:55] The atonement he made before the
[1:00:57] foundation of the world was now
[1:00:58] manifested in time.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's done. I've paid it in
[1:01:02] full completeness done. No more
[1:01:05] interest, no down payments. This ain't
[1:01:06] some, you know, part of a, you know,
[1:01:08] this is not a deposit on full
[1:01:10] redemption. No, I purchased it in full."
[1:01:12] That's in God's mind. Right now, when
[1:01:14] that same thought, when that, you know,
[1:01:16] when the reality of that is transmitted
[1:01:18] down into your heart, then you're at
[1:01:20] rest cuz you realize truly it's
[1:01:22] finished.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; It's done. My sin question settled.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been answered. Amen. I don't
[1:01:28] need to worry and guess, oh, did he
[1:01:30] really die for me? Is, you know, am I
[1:01:31] really under the blood? You can realize,
[1:01:33] no, I have been I have received the
[1:01:35] atonement. God has made have has made me
[1:01:38] one with him. And the sin question is
[1:01:41] settled. I trust it's all anchored. See,
[1:01:42] but those are at rest who are not at
[1:01:44] rest wonder about that. Am I really
[1:01:47] forgiven? Am I really justified that I
[1:01:50] never did it in the first place? In
[1:01:52] God's mind, you never did it in the
[1:01:53] first place. Am I really safe and
[1:01:55] secure?
[1:01:57] But when you enter into rest, you
[1:01:58] realize I'm it's done.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; You can let off the pressure. You don't
[1:02:02] need to worry about Lord, you know, is
[1:02:04] this is is this really true? It's been
[1:02:06] revealed to you. Amen. But it'll never
[1:02:10] do us any good until we accept it. It's
[1:02:12] your accepting of him as your personal
[1:02:14] savior. And it's by faith that you
[1:02:16] receive it and believe it. Now, Hebrews
[1:02:17] 3:1, the Bible said he's the high priest
[1:02:20] of our profession. Now, he seated it at
[1:02:21] the right hand of the father to make
[1:02:23] intercessions for us upon our
[1:02:24] confession. Now, remember, it isn't
[1:02:26] much. See, it isn't how much you cry. It
[1:02:29] isn't how much you repent. It isn't how
[1:02:32] loud you can cry to God. It isn't how
[1:02:34] sincere you can be. It's how much faith
[1:02:36] that you have when you come to him. Says
[1:02:40] the faith you carry is what matters.
[1:02:44] Take it up with brother Bram if you're
[1:02:46] not happy about this. He doesn't save
[1:02:47] you based on the merits of your prayer.
[1:02:49] He doesn't save you upon the merits of
[1:02:51] your righteousness. He saves you upon
[1:02:53] the merits of your faith. It's by faith
[1:02:55] you're saved. And that through grace.
[1:02:59] You say, "Well, I cried a lot. I had
[1:03:00] this. That's all good." But what about
[1:03:02] the faith you're holding? That's really
[1:03:05] the thing that matters. Amen. That's why
[1:03:07] you can have two people with very, you
[1:03:09] know, very similar experiences, maybe at
[1:03:12] the altar, maybe at a camp or somewhere,
[1:03:14] but then one actually ends up leaving
[1:03:16] the world like Lord completely becomes
[1:03:18] an atheist, but the other one's a
[1:03:20] soldout Christian. What was the
[1:03:22] difference? One had faith, one just had
[1:03:25] emotion.
[1:03:27] Are you against emotion? You know me
[1:03:29] long enough. I like emotion. I like a
[1:03:31] heartfelt religion.
[1:03:34] Amen. I do. Okay. I'm not against those
[1:03:36] things. But what do we approach God
[1:03:38] with?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Our faith.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; We believe that he is. And he's a
[1:03:43] rewarder of them who diligently seek
[1:03:44] him.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're resting in that. Now, when
[1:03:47] you're resting, now there's a great
[1:03:49] weapon that's deposited into you.
[1:03:52] The greatest weapon that I know of is um
[1:03:54] of a Christian today is a committal to
[1:03:57] God. When you can't do nothing about it,
[1:03:59] just commit it to him and God will take
[1:04:01] care of it. Do you believe that? He
[1:04:04] says, let's just read the first part. As
[1:04:05] long as you're going to do it, if
[1:04:07] someone talks about you and you talk
[1:04:08] back about them, God can't fight your
[1:04:10] battle. You're fighting it yourself.
[1:04:12] See, just let loose and let him do it
[1:04:13] and just commit it to him.
[1:04:16] You say, "Well, prayer is a great
[1:04:17] weapon." Yeah, brothers, actually,
[1:04:19] listen. There's a lot of great weapons
[1:04:20] that have been placed in your hand. One
[1:04:22] is a complete committal to the Lord. So,
[1:04:24] you're going through something. There's
[1:04:25] a case or something happening in your
[1:04:26] life and you don't have the answer. If
[1:04:29] you're at rest, you can fully commit
[1:04:30] that into the hands of the Lord and then
[1:04:33] you can start praising God, the answer's
[1:04:35] coming.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a great weapon.
[1:04:40] Because when you let it because many
[1:04:42] times in our sincerity, we get in God's
[1:04:45] way.
[1:04:46] Family, loved ones, college, whoever it
[1:04:49] is, God's working with God's dealing
[1:04:51] with someone. The nest is being stirred
[1:04:52] up. You know, we can if we're not
[1:04:55] careful,
[1:04:57] we can tamper with that.
[1:04:58] And then we try and put the nest back
[1:05:00] together. And God wants it stirred
[1:05:02] because he wants that person to realize
[1:05:03] they're an eagle and fly. So we got to
[1:05:06] be very careful how we deal s you know
[1:05:07] with situations. We need wisdom. You
[1:05:09] know like I remember Dave's not here but
[1:05:12] if you haven't heard him preach brother
[1:05:13] Tazes he did a wonderful job giving his
[1:05:15] testimony but you know he brings up
[1:05:16] multiple times how Isaac you know Isaac
[1:05:18] would say God you know when David was in
[1:05:20] the world and you know you guys would
[1:05:22] pray God make it terrible for him.
[1:05:25] Amen. Right. And and when you pray that
[1:05:27] I said, "Amen." Because for he needed to
[1:05:30] realize he didn't belong out there.
[1:05:33] Amen. But if you try and you try and
[1:05:35] keep someone together, then God can't
[1:05:37] work.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, we got to come to a point
[1:05:42] where it's like, God, you deal. That's a
[1:05:43] committ.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Is it hard to watch humanly? Absolutely.
[1:05:47] But we want God to get a hold of people,
[1:05:49] right? So, you just commit them to the
[1:05:51] Lord and then thank God that the
[1:05:52] answer's on its way. Amen. Now, when
[1:05:56] you're at rest, there's a different
[1:05:57] attitude
[1:05:59] that now anchors into you or a different
[1:06:01] atmosphere, right? You're not stressed.
[1:06:04] You're not worried. There's about the
[1:06:06] Lord now. You just know in your heart
[1:06:08] it's done. Okay? And then now this
[1:06:12] changes everything because when you're
[1:06:13] at rest, your problems of your life
[1:06:16] really don't affect you like they used
[1:06:18] to. They're still there maybe, you know,
[1:06:20] but you're at rest. And it changes the
[1:06:22] attitude that you that you approach God
[1:06:25] in or that you come to church in. He
[1:06:28] says, "But it's the attitude of the
[1:06:29] people that brings the results." Your
[1:06:31] attitude. Absolutely. So, we're we're
[1:06:34] approaching camp, right? Whose attitude
[1:06:37] is this is going to be incredible. I'm
[1:06:40] excited. Lord, you're going to do
[1:06:42] amazing things. Well, that just coming
[1:06:44] with that attitude is going to bring a
[1:06:46] result. Amen. It's going to bring an
[1:06:49] incredible result cuz you're under
[1:06:50] expectation. Lord, we've seen you do so
[1:06:53] much before and Lord, you're going to do
[1:06:55] it again. And Lord, there's people are
[1:06:56] coming who don't know you. They're not
[1:06:58] saved. And God, you're going to do
[1:06:59] incredible things and you're going to
[1:07:00] touch out all of our lives. It's going
[1:07:02] to be amazing. It's the attitude, right?
[1:07:04] See, that's the reason at Pentecost,
[1:07:05] they had to go to an upper room and pray
[1:07:07] until the Holy Ghost came cuz they got
[1:07:09] in one place and one accord. That's the
[1:07:11] atmosphere that brings results. You
[1:07:13] believe it? that every man and woman in
[1:07:15] this building this morning, I say
[1:07:16] tonight, boy or girl, get everything
[1:07:18] from their minds but the Lord Jesus and
[1:07:20] believe that he's standing present right
[1:07:21] now and you'll see something happening
[1:07:23] that will cause headlines in the
[1:07:25] newspaper in the morning. That's right.
[1:07:26] It's atmosphere. So when you're at rest,
[1:07:30] it produces an atmosphere. Lord,
[1:07:34] everything's fine. Nothing's between me
[1:07:36] and you. Lord, you're awesome. You're
[1:07:38] the lover of my soul. The sin question
[1:07:40] settled. Lord, you're my shepherd.
[1:07:43] You're leading me. You're you're you're
[1:07:45] fulfilling your word. I trust you more
[1:07:47] than anything. You're so amazing, Lord.
[1:07:49] You brought me through many difficult,
[1:07:51] dangerous places. You brought me out,
[1:07:53] Lord. I love you with all my heart. What
[1:07:55] does it do? That produces an atmosphere
[1:07:59] because your mind is not upon the things
[1:08:02] the devil's trying to upset your life
[1:08:03] with. Your mind is upon the Lord Jesus
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; because you're at rest.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I pray we are all at rest. And
[1:08:13] if you haven't come to that place, I
[1:08:15] pray God, you say, "Lord, I believe it's
[1:08:17] for me." That true baptism of the Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost. What will happen? What am I
[1:08:21] looking for? Just look for him. How will
[1:08:25] it manifest? I don't know. God's God's
[1:08:28] sovereign with everybody. But may
[1:08:30] whatever happens to you, maybe you look
[1:08:33] back and say, "Something happened to me
[1:08:34] over the space of time. But now I have a
[1:08:38] rest in my soul. The world can be
[1:08:41] falling apart, but something's anchored
[1:08:42] in me.
[1:08:44] Lord, you're my rock and I'm anchored
[1:08:47] and all is well.
[1:08:50] Amen. So, I I I pray and and and to use
[1:08:53] the word feeling is the wrong word
[1:08:55] because it's far deeper than that. But I
[1:08:56] pray that everyone here will be in that
[1:08:59] state or is in that state. You're
[1:09:01] resting. Do you have the answers to
[1:09:03] everything? No, I don't need them.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; He has them. He's in control. Let's have
[1:09:09] the musicians tonight, please. Amen. But
[1:09:12] I trust we're all at rest.
[1:09:21] Amen. Maybe let's just sing a song, then
[1:09:23] we'll then we'll we'll sing a psalm and
[1:09:26] go out, shall we? Um I want to sing that
[1:09:30] song. You know, there is um there is
[1:09:31] peace at the table of the Lord.
[1:09:34] I'm invited to the T. Yeah, there is.
[1:09:36] Yeah. Um Yes. So the table. Let's let's
[1:09:38] just stand and sing that tonight. I saw
[1:09:40] that line, you know, there's peace. And
[1:09:42] I don't know if it's here, but I don't
[1:09:44] know if it's written in here, but you
[1:09:45] know, we could sing, there's rest at the
[1:09:47] table of the Lord. I won't worry
[1:09:49] anymore. I'm at his table. He's invited
[1:09:51] me in, and all is well. Amen. So, let's
[1:09:54] just sing this and then we'll we'll
[1:09:56] close in prayer. And
[1:10:00] I will feast at the table of the Lord.

[1:16:01] Amen. So thankful for that. Hallelujah.
[1:16:04] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:16:05] prayer before we go. I just want to just
[1:16:08] ask if there's anyone here who says, "I
[1:16:10] need to be in that rest." Will you want
[1:16:12] to raise your hand to the Lord? Gracious
[1:16:15] Father, it's such a joy to enter into
[1:16:18] your rest. Enter into that true Sabbath,
[1:16:20] dear God. That baptism of the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost. We're sealed the day of our
[1:16:24] redemption, Lord. That we're no longer
[1:16:26] us trying to be a believer, Lord. It's
[1:16:28] you within us being the Christian, dear
[1:16:30] God. Such a joy, Lord, to see you live
[1:16:33] in our lives, Lord. Just to be at rest,
[1:16:35] Lord. Doesn't matter what's happening in
[1:16:37] our minds, Lord God. We're just in our
[1:16:39] souls is just a there's a confidence, my
[1:16:42] God. There's such an assurance, Lord,
[1:16:44] that we are yours. And Lord, we're your
[1:16:46] children. We're your sheep of your
[1:16:47] pastor. And you're the great shepherd
[1:16:50] God that Lord, that goes before us and
[1:16:52] leads us and protects us. And Lord,
[1:16:54] there's something so powerful about
[1:16:55] being in rest, Lord. We just know
[1:16:57] there's nothing can harm us without it
[1:16:59] getting permission from you first, dear
[1:17:00] God. And you're going to use it, Lord,
[1:17:02] to get glory. You're going to turn it
[1:17:04] against the enemy and use it for our
[1:17:06] good. And we're so thankful for that,
[1:17:07] dear God. I just pray for everyone here,
[1:17:09] those who may be listening, anyone here
[1:17:11] who has not entered into that rest. Oh
[1:17:14] God, bring them in. Lord, may they just
[1:17:16] take at your word, receive it, Lord, in
[1:17:18] the name of Jesus Christ. I pray,
[1:17:20] Father, Lord, that you would bring them
[1:17:21] in, Lord, to that rest. And may they
[1:17:24] know what I'm talking about. May it not
[1:17:25] be some abstract idea to them, but may
[1:17:27] it be a living reality, Lord, to be
[1:17:30] resting, dear God,
[1:17:32] sealed to the day of their redemption in
[1:17:34] your Holy Ghost. Lord, I just commit the
[1:17:36] service into your hands. Just want to
[1:17:38] pray you'd watch over us as we as we as
[1:17:40] we go our separate ways now we drive
[1:17:42] home different places Lord. Keep us safe
[1:17:44] on the road Lord and be with us for the
[1:17:46] rest of the week. Dear God, we love you
[1:17:48] with all our hearts. We thank you in
[1:17:49] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[1:17:53] bless you friends. You're dismissed in
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ's name.
