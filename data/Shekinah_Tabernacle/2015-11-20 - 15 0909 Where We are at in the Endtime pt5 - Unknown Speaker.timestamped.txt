[32:08] can put it into an agenda so we're going
[32:11] to just read again where we read just
[32:14] read a smaller portion of Genesis 24
[32:16] we'll just go from verse 56 and we
[32:20] understand this is very much a scripture
[32:22] that is uh speaks of us in the stay an
[32:24] hour or 34 verse 50 60 sitter he said
[32:28] unto the impending me not as Eleazar
[32:30] speaking to Rebecca's family seeing the
[32:32] Lord has prospered my way send me away
[32:34] that I may go to my master and they said
[32:37] we will call the damsel and inquire her
[32:40] mouth and they called Rebecca and said
[32:42] unto her will they'll go with this man
[32:44] and she said I'll go and they sent away
[32:47] Rebecca this is to end her nurse and
[32:49] Abraham servants and his men and they
[32:52] blessed Rebecca and said unto her thou
[32:54] art our sister beat out the mother of
[32:56] thousands of millions and let thy seed
[32:58] possess the gates of those which hate
[33:00] them and Rebecca arose and her damsels
[33:03] and they followed so I and they rode
[33:07] upon the camels and followed the man and
[33:09] the servant took Rebecca and went his
[33:12] way we'll just go to John chapter 1 and
[33:15] we're going to read a scripture here
[33:17] this is a bit a bit of context John one
[33:21] and so st. John chapter 1 verse 43
[33:27] and at CCA
[33:30] such as Jesus now he's calling he begins
[33:33] to call its disciple this is the day
[33:35] following Jesus would go forth into
[33:38] Galilee and find its Phillip and saith
[33:40] unto Him follow me I mean let's just our
[33:44] heads in a wood of prayer father we have
[33:48] opened your work Lord with so now heart

[33:55] shape us into your image father Lord we

[34:00] takes you the great author of your word
[34:01] to come and speak and forth to us and

[34:46] ask please in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[34:48] amen you may you may have your seats so
[34:52] I want to continue where I was speaking
[34:54] on Sunday just going into a bit of a
[34:58] thought here where we are on the end
[34:59] time and we understand for reading
[35:01] Genesis 24 that we are living out that
[35:04] scripture we are the Rebecca and in that
[35:07] story and that shadow there that we read
[35:10] about it as being looked out in your
[35:11] life and we understand by the reading of
[35:14] the scripture that the eleazar call we
[35:16] have heard the eleazar call where your
[35:18] there's no dispute that we have received
[35:21] Malachi 4 we have received you know we
[35:24] have seen the Son of Man
[35:26] be made manifest in this day yo there's
[35:29] no dispute about those things and but
[35:31] the great thing now is there's a
[35:33] challenge now it says come and you know
[35:35] said there Rebecca followed the man and
[35:39] the servant took Rebecca and and went
[35:42] his way and then Jesus we understand
[35:44] when he would call his disciples he you
[35:46] see to them follow me and they would
[35:48] something ever may just drop their life
[35:50] and they just followed her and this word
[35:53] follow is quite a quite interesting it
[35:55] it speaks about it speaks it says as a
[36:01] particle of union that means a road
[36:04] properly to be in the same way with that
[36:07] is to accompany this is specifically as
[36:10] a disciple to follow or to reach so to
[36:13] follow someone is to accompany them
[36:15] along the way and to follow someone is
[36:20] you know you become what you follow this
[36:23] is what I'm going to go down the road
[36:25] today tonight you become what you follow
[36:27] you know it doesn't matter whatever it
[36:30] is in life whatever you follow in life
[36:33] you will become that thing and and that
[36:35] thing that you follow you say well I'm
[36:37] not following anything anything you
[36:39] admire you become and that thing you
[36:42] admire is the thing you're actually
[36:44] following so you can come to church you
[36:46] can read your Bible you can do whatever
[36:47] you want but the thing you admire that's
[36:49] the thing you're really following that's
[36:51] the thing that's really has your heart
[36:53] is the thing that that that you admire
[36:55] and I even remember your boarding school
[36:58] there was a guy in my boarding hostels
[37:00] and here as me this this this yo he
[37:04] wasn't even my friend but I but I
[37:07] admired him you weren't even friends but
[37:09] you know we didn't even hang out or
[37:10] anything by thought he was cool and i
[37:12] ended up eventually dressing like he did
[37:14] because i had mine and mike's he begin
[37:16] to follow him amen i begin to become him
[37:19] and we understand that in this hour that
[37:23] our lord has done he has revealed
[37:26] himself in such a way that you know what
[37:29] we follow we are looking
[37:30] we're looking at him and the scripture
[37:33] tells us I just want to read a few
[37:35] scriptures we just let's go to 2nd
[37:38] Corinthians chapter 3 and i know this is
[37:41] play very familiar scripture to tell us
[37:43] but you know Paul begins to say
[37:46] something that's quite profound where he
[37:49] would say that we had changed and I'll
[37:51] just you know as we're turning you just
[37:54] paraphrase says that as we behold him we
[37:56] changed from glory to glory and we read
[38:00] this here in 2nd Corinthians 3 and 16 to
[38:02] 18 that says nevertheless when it shall
[38:07] turn to the Lord speak of the Jews the
[38:09] veil shall be turned away now the Lord
[38:12] is that spirit and where the Spirit of
[38:13] the Lord is there is Liberty but we all
[38:16] would open face beholding as in a glut
[38:19] and a glass the glory of the Lord had
[38:21] changed and to the same image from glory
[38:23] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[38:26] Lord so there's something that has
[38:27] caught our attention on the same time
[38:29] and we were holding it and that thing
[38:31] that we are following in that we are
[38:32] looking at we're being changed into its
[38:34] very image right and we can see this if
[38:37] we I just want to go to Leviticus
[38:39] chapter 23 and I want to just speak
[38:42] about the wave sheaf offering because
[38:44] Eleazar even though we understand that
[38:46] Eleazar was the faithful servant but a
[38:49] faithful servant doesn't represent
[38:50] himself he doesn't inject themselves and
[38:52] anything he does he is just a like a
[38:55] mute and everything he speaks is not as
[38:58] I'm thinking not his own ability as not
[39:00] as I'm cressona but it says master
[39:02] speaking he is just an empty vessel that
[39:05] his master reveals himself through and
[39:07] so when Eleazar would speak to Rebecca
[39:09] it wasn't his fault it wasn't his ideas
[39:12] it was Isaac was being revealed through
[39:15] this man you know true to repeat current
[39:17] and the very words that he was speaking
[39:20] to Rebekah course Rebecca to fall in
[39:23] love with Isaac I mean because it was
[39:25] Isaac being revealed us and we can see
[39:28] this
[39:28] this end time where we do not love we
[39:31] have not fallen in love with brother
[39:32] branham even though we do love and
[39:35] appreciate him you understand as a
[39:36] brother but he is not our Lord and
[39:38] Savior we do not worship Him we do not
[39:40] adore him we don't follow him I mean
[39:44] even though we do follow them but we
[39:46] don't follow them because Paul said
[39:48] follow me as I follow Christ and
[39:50] ultimately those have received Paul's
[39:52] message weren't following the man Paul
[39:54] they are feeling our following the God
[39:56] that was being unveiled krupal that's
[39:58] the same thing in the same time we we
[40:01] don't follow brother Brennan but we
[40:02] follow brother branham because they
[40:04] follow the God to reveal himself further
[40:05] profit you see and that is the one we
[40:08] love understand the veil is just the
[40:11] veil that God uses the valve is the one
[40:13] I you're being veiled in that bail that
[40:16] we want to really get a hold off amen
[40:18] glory you understand so now here and in
[40:22] Leviticus we have so we have this feast
[40:25] of the first fruits and we'll just go to
[40:30] Leviticus chapter 23 and we go to verse
[40:32] 9 and we understand that these seven
[40:36] feasts are prophetic and what the Jews
[40:38] were doing there on top has been looked
[40:40] out and we understand that you know
[40:42] these these seven feasts we are we are
[40:45] right at the end when it comes to time
[40:46] and we won't go into those things but
[40:48] this here speaks of Calvary and speaks
[40:52] to the resurrectionists is in the Lord
[40:53] spake unto Moses saying speak unto the
[40:55] children of Israel and sound to them
[40:57] when ye be coming to the land which I
[41:00] give unto you and reap the harvest their
[41:02] up then you shall bring a sheaf of the
[41:04] first fruits of your harvest under the
[41:07] priests and you shall wave the sheaf
[41:09] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[41:12] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[41:15] priest shall wavered and you shall offer
[41:17] that day when you wave the Sheik and he
[41:20] lamb without blemish of the first year
[41:22] for a burnt offering unto the Lord
[41:27] now we see they're instructed now to
[41:29] take your field we're part of it comes
[41:32] mature need to cut it down to the
[41:35] priests and he waves that before the
[41:37] Lord on the day after the Sabbath which
[41:40] is would be in our calendar or some day
[41:41] and then it was waived for that the
[41:44] people would be accepted for your
[41:47] acceptance now this is all shadow now
[41:49] and we've seen it in the first when
[41:51] Jesus Jesus he heroes a day after the
[41:53] Sabbath and he was he was lifted up he
[41:57] was our sin offering and he was he was
[41:59] he took his own blood up to the presence
[42:01] of God for us to be accepted and that
[42:04] life now was waved over the people a
[42:07] mint and that was done because God was
[42:10] showing up this is he was the first he
[42:13] was the first one from the dead he was
[42:15] he was the first fruit of the New
[42:17] Testament church and he was now waved he
[42:20] was lifted up he was cut down and lifted
[42:23] up before the people so we could be
[42:25] accepted and only that not only that we
[42:28] would be accepted but God was saying
[42:30] this life that you've seen it and and my
[42:32] son and me is going to be come down unto
[42:35] you and that same life is going to be
[42:37] short and it's going to grow into you
[42:39] you're going to become what you're
[42:40] beholding what you're looking at amen as
[42:45] your first brains in the field had eyes
[42:47] and could look and what's the priest way
[42:49] better feel great they would be
[42:51] beholding something being waved and they
[42:54] would be looking at it saying we're
[42:55] gonna because there's a life of us now
[42:57] and that life must bring forth after
[42:59] what it's meant to be and that means
[43:01] we're going to become that that wave
[43:03] offering this being ways amen amen
[43:05] because to follow something you have to
[43:07] look at what you're following you
[43:09] understand so now there has to be we
[43:11] have to actually look at you know what
[43:14] do you see when you see the message I
[43:16] see the resurrected Jesus Christ that's
[43:19] what I see and so I'm following I'm be
[43:22] holding that and there's now an
[43:25] expectation because you become what you
[43:27] follow I meant you become what you look
[43:30] at there's a
[43:31] if you're looking at the gods with
[43:32] sports or reading some magazine or doing
[43:35] doing anything in the world you become
[43:37] you see people they the very spirit of
[43:40] the thing they're looking at anoints
[43:42] them and they become what they look at
[43:44] every every facet of the offensive its
[43:47] popular culture of its port of us about
[43:50] some great thing of learning or whatever
[43:52] it is they become that they embody the
[43:55] thing that they're following a me and
[43:59] that's just as you know that is just a
[44:01] perverted thing of the Christian now
[44:03] following be holding a resurrected life
[44:07] Alleluia so now Rebecca because we know
[44:10] Rebecca you know on her journey with
[44:13] Eleazar going to become one with Isaac
[44:15] she would have changed over that journey
[44:17] no doubt I mean it would have been a
[44:19] molding and shaping it up you know the
[44:21] very words coming out of that servants
[44:23] mouth would have impacted her life and
[44:26] changed and changed her life so then
[44:29] finally when the head quit because
[44:30] remember the man is the head the woman
[44:33] is the body who understand and so now
[44:34] when when when the head Isaac was coming
[44:37] out to the field to meet the body and he
[44:40] came a union now they just they just
[44:42] blended together as one amen because she
[44:46] became she became her I mean in that
[44:50] union now she became her and she wasn't
[44:53] Rebecca anymore she was Isaac she was
[44:56] mrs. isaac alleluia I mean because she
[45:00] was those words that she was hearing her
[45:03] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[45:05] Word of God it's a principle I need I
[45:08] feel like I don't have much faith here
[45:10] the work Amy I feel I I don't feel very
[45:13] strong on my walk put on a message maybe
[45:15] I mean read the work faint cometh by
[45:18] hearing and that is you know it's a
[45:22] simple principle it's like I'm hungry
[45:24] cook some food yeah if you don't cook
[45:26] the food you don't get fed I mean faith
[45:30] cometh by hearing tonnelle chic she here
[45:33] in the woods of that messenger now
[45:34] thanks for getting to rise and her
[45:37] character and everything she was was
[45:39] being molded on that journey now
[45:41] that when when when when Isaac came out
[45:44] they became one and so now Christ was
[45:48] that wave sheaf that was waived on the
[45:49] day of Pentecost and that same life that
[45:52] was waved over the people now when went
[45:55] into those ones and up go in the upper
[45:58] room because they were part of the
[46:00] harvest as well I mean they were green
[46:03] as well hallelujah they weren't another
[46:05] specie they were they were part of that
[46:07] God reach that first part of that God
[46:09] race that God would bring forth out of
[46:11] every kindred nation and time they were
[46:13] part of it amen to that same life that
[46:16] was waived our wedding to them and then
[46:19] now we have come we have come from from
[46:21] that first Pentecost and we've come all
[46:23] the way down and through this this
[46:26] Pentecost and a true Pentecost is now a
[46:29] uniting of God and man because that's
[46:32] what happened all the first Pentecost
[46:33] that has must happen in this season as
[46:35] well with God and man have become one
[46:38] and so brother burn he would he would
[46:41] begin to speak a sermon and he would he
[46:44] would entitle at the right it is the
[46:46] rising of the sun and this is very
[46:48] important because it's more than just
[46:50] ate a Easter service but he would begin
[46:53] to lay out now where we are in time
[46:55] because they profit can see where we are
[46:57] he would he go he said in your earlier
[47:01] messages it's like a you know it's like
[47:03] with me when you're in America where
[47:06] they where the president signed the
[47:08] Emancipation Proclamation at all / to go
[47:11] free on a certain day and he would say
[47:13] the younger ones because as soon as they
[47:15] saw the sunlight that's when that day
[47:18] dawn and as soon as the day dawn they
[47:19] were free and so the older ones and you
[47:22] may be the you're the little ones they
[47:24] can climb up the mountain or up the hill
[47:26] to see the sunrise so younger ones who
[47:29] had the strength could climb up there
[47:30] and they could see the Sun rising and
[47:33] the people in the valley they couldn't
[47:34] see it rise but they could see as soon
[47:36] as those race hit their face they could
[47:38] point down and they could scream down to
[47:40] the people in the valley we're free
[47:42] hallelujah we're free and they could
[47:44] proclaim it down to those ones who
[47:46] couldn't see the sunrise
[47:48] yet and then and then so they would
[47:50] relay the message down and those ones
[47:52] who had never seen the sunrise yet
[47:54] because they heard that message they
[47:56] could say we're free hallelujah we're
[47:59] free so and then finally the day dawned
[48:01] and then they experienced what the one
[48:04] on the mountain was talking about it so
[48:06] when brother Brad with Sanders the
[48:08] rising of the Sun some people would say
[48:10] what are you talking about well already
[48:12] had a already had a resurrection but he
[48:14] was declaring this is a new day where
[48:16] people are not bounded ended up Dahmer
[48:18] denominational too many more how do you
[48:21] say it is the rising of the Sun said now
[48:23] now we're free melia he said we're not
[48:26] dead in some too many more but we have
[48:28] come out of the tomb we've come out of
[48:30] the tomb of religion and man's ideas and
[48:32] now we're resurrected were a resurrected
[48:35] people and a lot of people didn't really
[48:37] understand what he was talking about but
[48:39] that's because he was up on the mountain
[48:42] and then finally the Rays of that Sun
[48:44] shined upon their faces and then they
[48:46] began to understood where resurrected
[48:48] people mmm arisen we once did in
[48:50] trespasses and sins but now we're alive
[48:53] forevermore hallelujah and then he would
[48:55] say now in the sermon he would go he
[49:00] would go to Leviticus 23 and he would
[49:02] begin to speak about the wave sheaf
[49:04] offering and he would he would declare
[49:07] now because a type we understand is more
[49:11] than just finding a story and fitting
[49:14] something to a story and saying isn't
[49:15] that neat but a type is declaring now
[49:18] this is what's going on and so he would
[49:21] he would begin to say that I'll just
[49:24] read it he says if there would be this
[49:28] is paragraph 2026 if there would be any
[49:32] holy ritual it should come forth on the
[49:35] Sabbath day which was the seventh day of
[49:38] the week which is saturday but did you
[49:40] notice in this memorial you speaking of
[49:43] the wave sheaf now did you notice in
[49:46] this memorial to wave it on the first
[49:48] day of the week the sheet which was the
[49:51] first of your seed that you planted when
[49:54] it comes up and ripens you cut down this
[49:57] sheet and take it to the priests and let
[49:59] him take it and wave it before
[50:01] Lord for your exception that you are
[50:05] accepted you you have come with your
[50:09] sheep and he's to waive it before the
[50:11] Lord not on the Sabbath the seventh day
[50:14] but on the first day which we call
[50:17] Sunday issue ND of course that's a Roman
[50:21] word which they called it the sunday for
[50:25] the Sun gods but how it has changed it's
[50:27] not the issue anymore turds it's a iso
[50:31] nday sunday that that corn of wheat
[50:35] God's first one up from the dead is to
[50:38] be waved over the congregation that we
[50:41] are his seat and that's the first of the
[50:44] seed of those that slip waved upon the
[50:47] first day of the week on Sunday he
[50:49] raised up waved goodbye and ascended up
[50:52] on high in the presence of the people
[50:54] notice it was the first court of God's
[50:57] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[50:59] God's first corn of wheat by God's
[51:02] quickening power God quickened his life
[51:05] raised him up from the dead and he was
[51:08] the first fruits of those that slept the
[51:10] first fruit he was that sheath that's
[51:13] why they had to wave that sheet for it
[51:15] was the first one that comes to maturity
[51:18] and it waved as a memorial of
[51:21] Thanksgiving to God believing that the
[51:23] rest of them would come and it was a
[51:26] sign and today because he was the first
[51:29] son of God to come to full maturity to
[51:31] being God it was plucked up from the
[51:34] earth and waved over the people he says
[51:36] oh what a glorious lesson by the
[51:38] quickening power the first the first one
[51:41] although he'd been typed in many times
[51:43] and we'll see later that he was typed
[51:46] but this is really this is really the
[51:50] first heard of them that slipped his
[51:52] waved over the promise see there was
[51:54] promised to life his waved at the day of

[52:05] Pentecostal people that was of a
[52:07] Pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[52:09] come
[52:10] to be waived again we realize in the
[52:12] last day now he's jumping 2000 years now

[52:19] Luke 17 and the ESO in someday again and
[52:23] the day that the sonf man will be

[52:34] Christ and that's going to be raised
[52:37] waved over the people remember what you
[52:40] look at what you admirers what you
[52:41] follow and that's why it was waived
[52:43] that's why was waived upon the sir then
[52:46] elect people could look at it and they
[52:49] could begin to follow it begin to admire
[52:51] and as they're doing that they would
[52:53] become it alleluia I mean they would
[52:57] become it now now who is this son of man

[53:05] and the Word was with God and the Word
[53:07] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[53:10] dwelt among us and of all the teaching
[53:12] that we have and confirmation of the
[53:15] Word of God by the Word of God by
[53:18] science by wonders we see today that the
[53:21] Book of Luke here we just quoted look
[53:24] seventeenth chapter 30th verse and
[53:26] Malachi 4 and the different scriptures

[53:32] word again is waived over the people
[53:34] that the dead to did traditions of man
[53:37] is dead and the Son of God is alive

[1:03:50] Rebecca had to be willing to say just
[1:03:53] for sake a role button' leave the well
[1:03:56] that senior leave a water box and all
[1:03:58] those things of this is where i love
[1:03:59] this is my family willing to forsake at
[1:04:02] all and follow this man amen and unless
[1:04:05] we're willing because we are sheep we
[1:04:09] are live but it depends whose voice you
[1:04:12] want to lead you because you will become
[1:04:15] your Shepherd amen and here's our great
[1:04:19] ship but you understand but it depends
[1:04:22] what you want to become it's also what
[1:04:26] has what has trap your grab your heart
[1:04:30] what do you admire I mean there's many
[1:04:34] say well I'm following Jesus but they
[1:04:35] admire something else and that means
[1:04:38] they're not following him what they
[1:04:39] really should amen so we really want to
[1:04:44] follow him we want to we want to become
[1:04:47] him now this smell so everything that
[1:04:52] was demonstrated in that prophet now
[1:04:54] that life you read you know when you
[1:04:57] read your brother Barry peace he's
[1:05:00] preaching on the identified masterpiece
[1:05:02] of God and he speaks about the
[1:05:04] patriarchs and Josephine every Theo like
[1:05:06] Abraham Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph he
[1:05:10] talks about the mall and then then
[1:05:12] Joseph was perfect
[1:05:13] he says it was the fusion out after the
[1:05:15] patriarchs down into the tribes so I was
[1:05:18] invited in one man there was like cut-up
[1:05:20] is used out so now everything you see in
[1:05:23] brother barons ministry the fullness I
[1:05:26] had the fullness and the age was
[1:05:27] embodied in that man so if raising the
[1:05:30] dead power power of creation the other
[1:05:32] truth of the word you coming to adoption
[1:05:35] all these things that you know
[1:05:36] everything you saw in his life you know
[1:05:39] being taken beyond the qunut time wall
[1:05:41] all these things pillar of fire being
[1:05:43] there and all your all these
[1:05:44] everything's done all of that now
[1:05:46] because people say is God doing anything
[1:05:48] today absolutely if you took if you took
[1:05:52] the testimony of all believers around
[1:05:54] the world and brought it all together
[1:05:56] you'd say absolutely guys doing a lot
[1:05:58] but it's now diffused out through a mini
[1:06:01] membered body you see see everything
[1:06:04] that was in the form of the ages of the
[1:06:06] problem everything was demonstrated in
[1:06:07] her and now those same ones that be held
[1:06:10] both of the man but be held that that
[1:06:12] resurrected life in her thank God that
[1:06:15] was vowel in him now they they became
[1:06:17] what they are looking at and it's
[1:06:20] everything I was done in his life now
[1:06:21] now operate down through the church
[1:06:23] that's why I said you know there's a
[1:06:25] gift us come on brother nimble of yo of
[1:06:27] prophesying all these things they said
[1:06:29] another one there was a little boy
[1:06:31] playing now fixing our cow saying
[1:06:33] whatever it was it was a lead going
[1:06:36] through a puddle of me and the boy was
[1:06:37] electrocuted and he died and they pray
[1:06:39] for me to go he's range from life if you
[1:06:41] go back to life all these different
[1:06:42] things whilst happening things having a
[1:06:45] brother browser history now happening
[1:06:46] among the believers amen okc because
[1:06:49] without diffusing out through everyone
[1:06:52] because they were becoming what they
[1:06:54] were holding right it's just like you
[1:06:56] take you take David's mighty men they
[1:06:58] went to be king I mean but they knew
[1:07:01] that that anointed man was coming into
[1:07:03] power with an anointed man we understand
[1:07:05] this Christ Jesus but in Europe they
[1:07:07] knew that he was coming into power they
[1:07:08] knew he was going to become king and
[1:07:10] that same anointing that fell upon him
[1:07:12] that gave him the line gave him the beer
[1:07:14] gave him Goliath he put him he put that
[1:07:17] John in the same category as those
[1:07:19] animals God gave me the line God gave me
[1:07:21] the beer he'll be the same as then
[1:07:23] there's a monoid you that came upon that
[1:07:25] little boy with a slug job to kill that
[1:07:27] giant now came to have opposed mighty
[1:07:29] men and they did in sports like henan
[1:07:32] does the same anointing came upon them
[1:07:34] because they were following David they
[1:07:37] were beholding David essaouira they
[1:07:40] certain aunt admire a meant the same
[1:07:44] thing the same thing today we've seen
[1:07:47] we've seen an anointed one amen and we
[1:07:51] behold that anointed one and we're
[1:07:53] following that anointed one we mean I
[1:07:55] meant anything so that same like that
[1:07:58] was in there as it annoyed that anointed
[1:08:00] what is now coming to us so the same
[1:08:02] overcoming life that was in him is
[1:08:04] enough I meant that same overcoming life
[1:08:09] girls on him to to overcome every
[1:08:11] situation I mean is enough Alleluia
[1:08:17] that's why when the believer deals in a
[1:08:19] situation and they can look beyond
[1:08:21] themselves and see really what's going
[1:08:23] on that's what my friend can do I mean
[1:08:26] you could really see took a more from
[1:08:28] face value and really see what was going
[1:08:30] on see the bigger picture so can the
[1:08:33] believer look beyond what they see with
[1:08:35] their eyes and see well this person's
[1:08:37] like this maybe cuz they had a bad day
[1:08:39] and this person's like this because it
[1:08:40] listen all these different and they can
[1:08:42] really step into what really what God
[1:08:45] would have them do amen why cuz that
[1:08:49] same life isn't us because we are we are
[1:08:53] following and then we are beholding
[1:08:57] someone is someone is really will be
[1:09:00] caught up with someone amen and we won
[1:09:04] and we become you know what you're
[1:09:06] thrilled with why your entire or what
[1:09:08] you love is what you become that's why
[1:09:10] as I said I'd son it's a love affair
[1:09:12] between us and our Isaac Liu you amen
[1:09:18] and then I think you know I'm just going
[1:09:22] to leave a dig so I know it's probably a
[1:09:24] bit late but you have to really I pray
[1:09:27] when you look at this message it's more
[1:09:30] than just suman's to you
[1:09:32] amen this is more than stories to you
[1:09:35] but the whole thing is a love letter
[1:09:37] yeah what do you mean he blasts people
[1:09:39] and he preaches against all these things
[1:09:42] he says if it if your kids on the
[1:09:44] roadside or he's or someone's in a boat
[1:09:47] they're going down the stream and
[1:09:48] they're going to go to a waterfall do
[1:09:50] you not say hey Johnny you want to come
[1:09:52] to the side you know you really you
[1:09:55] really get out there and you if you love
[1:09:57] them you'll get them if you can amen and
[1:10:00] that's why he would he would call black
[1:10:02] black and white white because he has
[1:10:04] drawing yah it says in the scripture
[1:10:06] that god looked down a plumb line yeah I
[1:10:08] mean when he builds his building we just
[1:10:10] be sex it straight and then so we can
[1:10:12] now know this is right and this is wrong
[1:10:15] all good yes I don't want to work out

[1:10:46] fully explain say just because it's go
[1:10:48] she fusses and cries in all these things
[1:10:50] because he doesn't understand amen
[1:10:54] that's why God had to lay down the
[1:10:56] message like you did so we can
[1:10:57] understand God likes us he doesn't like
[1:11:00] this he likes us you know he lays it out
