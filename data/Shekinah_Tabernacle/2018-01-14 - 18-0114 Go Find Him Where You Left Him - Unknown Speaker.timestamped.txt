[44:57] well
[44:59] let's let's go on the scripture to
[45:01] seeking Kings
[45:07] in chapter 3 do we have this it'll be
[45:17] there
[45:23] seeing kings chapter 3 and we'll start
[45:28] reading from verse 7
[45:34] seeing Kings three and seven seas here
[45:36] and he went so this read from verse six
[45:41] and kingj Ahura went out of Samaria at
[45:45] the same time and numbered all Israel
[45:46] and he went and sent two Jehoshaphat
[45:49] king of Judah saying the king of Moab
[45:52] hath rebelled hath rebelled against the
[45:57] king of Israel and King Jehovah and he
[46:00] went out and sent two king went to
[46:02] Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying the
[46:04] king of Moab has rebelled against me
[46:06] will thou go with me against Moab to
[46:08] battle and he said I will go up I am as
[46:11] thou art my people as thy people and my
[46:14] horses as thy horses and he said which
[46:17] way shall we go up he answered the way
[46:19] through the wilderness of Edom so the
[46:24] king of Israel went and the king of
[46:27] Judah and the king of Edom and they
[46:28] fetch the compass of seven days journey
[46:30] and there was no water for the host and
[46:33] for the cattle that followed them and
[46:35] the king of Israel said alas that the
[46:37] LORD hath called these three kings
[46:40] together to deliver them into the hand
[46:42] of Moab there's no mention of God
[46:44] telling them to go but Jehoshaphat said
[46:47] is there not a prophet of the Lord that
[46:50] we may inquire of the Lord by him and
[46:52] one of the king of Israel servants
[46:55] answered and said here is elisha the son
[46:57] of shaphat which poured water on the
[47:00] hands of Elijah and and Jehoshaphat said
[47:03] the word of the Lord is with them so the
[47:05] king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the
[47:08] king of Edom went down to him and Elisha
[47:11] said unto the king of Israel what have I
[47:13] to do with thee get thee to the profits
[47:16] of thy father and the profits of thy
[47:18] mother and the king of Israel said unto
[47:20] him nay for the LORD hath called these
[47:22] three kings together to deliver them
[47:24] into the hand of Moab and Elisha said is
[47:26] the Lord of Hosts liveth before whom I
[47:29] stand surely wear it not that I regard
[47:34] the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of
[47:36] Judah I
[47:37] not look toward thee nor CD but now
[47:40] bring me a minstrel and it came to pass
[47:41] when the minstrel played that the hand
[47:44] the Lord came upon him and he said thus
[47:46] saith the Lord make this valley full of
[47:48] ditches for thus saith the Lord you
[47:50] shall not see wounds neither shall you
[47:52] see rain yet that the valley shall be
[47:54] filled with water and you may drink both
[47:57] ye and your cattle and your beasts and
[48:00] this is but a light thing in the sight
[48:02] of the Lord he will deliver the Moabites
[48:04] enter into your hand amen and this just
[48:08] let's go to Luke chapter 2 just as a
[48:11] context how's that slideshow coming
[48:15] along are we dear here we are okay Luke
[48:20] Luke chapter 2 Matthew Mark and Luke we
[48:29] have it here look - and we're gonna read
[48:31] from verse 41 this is now his parents
[48:41] went to Jerusalem every year this is
[48:44] Jesus now this is Mary and Joseph was
[48:47] speaking of every year at the Feast of
[48:48] the Passover and when he was twelve
[48:50] years old they went up to Jerusalem
[48:51] after the custom of the feast and when
[48:57] they had fulfilled the days they
[48:58] returned as they returned the Child
[49:01] Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and
[49:03] Joseph and his mother knew it not sorry
[49:10] you're not tarry and you're not but they
[49:13] supposing him to be have been in the
[49:15] company went a day's journey and they
[49:17] sought him among their kinfolk and and
[49:21] acquaintances and when they found him
[49:24] not they returned back into Jerusalem
[49:26] seeking him and it came to pass that
[49:28] after three days they found him in the
[49:30] temple sitting in the midst of the
[49:31] doctors both hearing them and asking
[49:33] them questions and all that heard him
[49:35] were astonished at his understanding and
[49:39] answers and when they saw him they were
[49:41] amazed and his mother said unto him son
[49:44] why hast thou thus dwelt dealt with us
[49:48] behold my father and I have sought thee
[49:51] sorrowing and he said unto them how is
[49:53] it that ye that ye sought me wist ye not
[49:56] that I must be about my father's
[49:58] business amen may the Lord bless his
[50:02] word you may have your seats this
[50:03] morning now
[50:10] like a Titleist message this morning
[50:14] it's a very may be a very simple thought
[50:17] to many but you've got a my message this
[50:21] morning as you you got to go back where
[50:24] you left them wherever you left them you
[50:26] ought to go back to that spot now we
[50:28] read there and second Kings there was a
[50:32] there was an alliance between Israel and
[50:35] between Judah and Edom was servant I
[50:38] think two to one of those kings and they
[50:41] had decided that they would they would
[50:43] go and they would attack the Marv bites
[50:45] and we see that they found themselves in
[50:49] a predicament where they were seven days
[50:50] in the desert there was no water there
[50:52] you know they and and they begin to say
[50:55] well the Lord has brought us out here to
[50:57] perish but in life if we are led by him
[51:01] he doesn't lead us out to perish he
[51:03] leads us by his hand and where he is is
[51:06] the fullness of joy where he is as joy
[51:08] unspeakable full of glory he is the
[51:11] fountain that can never be quenched he's
[51:13] not a little bubbling trickle of some
[51:15] tap that's just leaking but he's an
[51:17] inexhaustible fountain Amen when Moses
[51:20] spoke to the rock and the wilderness it
[51:23] wasn't just a little trickle that came
[51:25] out of the rock it was a gusher because
[51:27] that water that came out of that rock it
[51:29] watered a million odd people and they're
[51:31] animals that's a lot of water that they
[51:33] needed so would have just been a trickle
[51:35] because if you're in the back of the
[51:36] line you would have died of thirst
[51:38] before you got to get any water it was a
[51:40] gusher came out hallelujah and we know
[51:42] that that rock and the wilderness was
[51:44] Christ amen he is not a little trickle
[51:47] of some blessing
[51:48] I mean he's greater than we can even
[51:50] imagine amen he's an inexhaustible
[51:53] fountain hallelujah and Jesus said you
[51:56] know come and drink of me and out of you
[51:58] will come amen
[52:00] a fountain of water hallelu speaking of
[52:03] a spirit but now in order for that
[52:06] fountain to come forth we had to stay in
[52:07] communion with him with the staying in
[52:10] fellowship with him right and so but
[52:13] then if we go our own way we break that
[52:16] fellowship and we many times presume
[52:19] that he is with us you can't presume
[52:22] that
[52:23] Marian Mary and Joseph they they they
[52:25] went up to Jerusalem you know they went
[52:27] up to the feastin and they and they he
[52:31] was with them for a stage but then when
[52:34] they turned around to walk back to their
[52:36] old life they begin to find out where is
[52:39] he where's where is this Messiah where
[52:43] is the very God that would redeem us
[52:45] where has he gone and they had to
[52:48] retrace their steps until they found
[52:51] where he was they had to go back where
[52:54] they left them they weren't they weren't
[52:56] planning on leaving him there
[52:58] they didn't say no now Joseph didn't say
[53:00] to Mary now honey this is what we're
[53:02] going to do we're going to go to
[53:03] Jerusalem we'll leave Jesus there and
[53:04] we'll come back to Nazareth where they
[53:06] were you know there wasn't a plan but
[53:08] situations in life many times can cause
[53:12] us to leave him behind I meant because
[53:15] because we we know our God he came from
[53:18] glory I mean to bridge the chasm between
[53:21] you and him hallelujah when we were
[53:24] alienated in our minds I mean we were
[53:26] his enemy I mean he came down to bridge
[53:29] the way to bridge the gulf I'm so glad
[53:32] it made me hot in this place but let's
[53:35] just rejoice I mean because this this
[53:38] world wants to make us just indifferent
[53:40] it wants to make us hard it was to make
[53:42] us calloused and wants to make us just
[53:45] flow fly by and watch the world go by I
[53:48] mean that's what the world wants to make
[53:50] us
[53:50] that's not our Porsche but you can get
[53:54] adjusted have you ever seen you know
[53:57] they say there's an experiment if you
[53:59] throw a frog into a pot of boiling water
[54:00] it'll jump out but if you put the frog
[54:03] in and the water's room temperature then
[54:06] you slowly turn up the heat that begins
[54:09] to swim and it swims and then it dies
[54:11] because it slowly gets used to the
[54:14] temperature but then it's too much and
[54:16] it dies we don't want to get adjusted we
[54:20] don't want to get adjusted oh you know
[54:22] the water gets hotter ice just a
[54:23] different season is it a different
[54:25] season you know is it is it just how
[54:28] this is meant to be we don't want to get
[54:30] adjusted to the world and not just the
[54:32] world but our condition I mean because
[54:35] our condition give
[54:36] come callused and i've experienced this
[54:38] very recently and and indifferent and
[54:41] just just you know you can put up a wall
[54:44] and become hardened and you can go your
[54:47] own way presuming that he's with you we
[54:51] mean to be lambs we're meant to be soft
[54:54] gentle amen not not calloused and you
[54:58] know we are soldiers we are we're we're
[55:01] battle-scarred veterans I mean but that
[55:03] doesn't make us hardened against our
[55:05] king I mean that should make us love him
[55:09] more
[55:10] hallelujah we're meant to be soft I mean
[55:13] we mean to be like Lambs
[55:14] I mean we're meant to be like doves this
[55:18] is this is a disposition of what we mean
[55:20] to have doesn't matter what Nathan your
[55:22] characteristics you can be you can be
[55:24] very quiet like a church mouse you can
[55:26] be very boisterous but down in your
[55:28] heart
[55:28] I mean we're meant to be like a lamb
[55:30] meek gentle Lord what is your direction
[55:34] what are you seeking to do what do you
[55:36] want to do in my life now if we if we if
[55:40] we barricade our hearts and barricade
[55:42] our lives and say no this is just how it
[55:44] is
[55:44] amen that's not being like a dove or a
[55:47] lamb we don't want to be like that are
[55:50] you with me let's not get just adjusted
[55:52] or something bad happened to me now I've
[55:55] gotta put up a defense no you don't have
[55:58] to you don't have to put up a defense
[56:00] necessarily you know say Lord come and
[56:03] heal that wounding hill that wounding
[56:06] come and repair that breach doesn't
[56:08] matter if anyone else's change change me
[56:10] I'm going to heaven by myself I don't at
[56:15] the end of the day now don't get me
[56:17] wrong I want you all there but your
[56:20] state I'm not going to let someone
[56:22] else's state hinder me that's in that
[56:26] right I'm not gonna let someone else's
[56:27] state hinder me in my walk
[56:29] it's my walk with God it's not you and
[56:31] me in him it's when it cut now we know
[56:34] we're a body we understand that I'm not
[56:36] disregarding that we're a body if one
[56:38] part of the body suffers we all suffer
[56:39] if one part rejoices we all rejoice
[56:42] right but when it all comes down to the
[56:44] end of the day it's me and him it's not
[56:48] me you and him boil
[56:49] it's me and him so at the end of the day
[56:51] how's my relationship with him that's
[56:54] not how my relationship with everyone
[56:55] else I mean if it's just me you know
[56:58] that's all I really care about what is
[57:01] your relationship with him how's that
[57:05] doing yeah how's your relationship with
[57:09] him going you got to check up sometimes
[57:11] maybe that's just a checking up kind of
[57:13] service but but is that a do you love
[57:16] him more now
[57:17] are you more like him now or you less
[57:19] like him have you gained ground or have
[57:22] you lost ground have you built a bunker
[57:24] or a you are you going forward we don't
[57:28] want to build bunkers I'm not interested
[57:30] in defense we're told to attack we're
[57:33] told to possess the land
[57:34] I meant the rest'll whatever's behind
[57:37] you will take care of itself let's press
[57:38] on I mean let's take what belongs to us
[57:42] hallelujah so they they presume they
[57:45] wait seven days into the desert and then
[57:47] they begin to say here we armed out in
[57:49] the middle but this is how we are
[57:51] sometimes we walk with God we think
[57:53] we're walking with God he's back there
[57:55] he never told you to come here but
[57:58] you're presuming and it's normally how
[58:01] other people treat you causes you to go
[58:03] that way right if it's not under prayer
[58:07] and you haven't really you know it's so
[58:09] easy to hold onto things isn't it it's
[58:12] so easy to hold on to a grudge or have a
[58:15] little bit of unforgive not in here
[58:16] maybe but in here I mean that's why you
[58:19] can't just have a you know repentance
[58:21] you know you can't ever dried out
[58:23] repentance and you don't just repeat you
[58:26] you have one time when you're opinio
[58:28] give your life to God right but then
[58:30] there comes times in your life where you
[58:32] got to go back to that place and you say
[58:34] God break me over mould me over again
[58:37] that's not to get saved again I'm not
[58:39] talking about that but we can get
[58:41] calloused in our and ourselves and we
[58:44] can lose our love for one another and
[58:46] that affects our relationship with God
[58:48] because he says if you love me you love
[58:51] one another by this all me know you are
[58:53] my disciples because you love one
[58:55] another and if you don't love your
[58:56] brother you don't love him that's why
[58:59] toys where the iron sharpens the iron
[59:01] the Balmer
[59:02] the grinding goes on amen and then we
[59:07] and then we begin to hold something eat
[59:08] someone but that is actually
[59:10] inadvertently transferred to our walk
[59:12] with God because we're just looking
[59:14] through those glasses we don't want to
[59:16] be like I don't want to be calloused I
[59:18] don't want to be distant if you're
[59:20] distant from God
[59:21] don't stay distant just takes a
[59:24] heartfelt prayer of sincerity and really
[59:27] repenting but guess what other people
[59:29] say I don't care what I don't I don't
[59:32] care how other people think you know
[59:33] when I when I act or what however I am
[59:36] as presence I don't care about other
[59:38] people I don't shut because other people
[59:40] will see me shouting I don't cry because
[59:42] other people will see me cry I'm
[59:44] worshiping him I'm worshiping him I
[59:47] don't care about anyone else I just want
[59:50] to forget about everyone else and just
[59:51] worship Him we shouldn't we shouldn't
[59:53] don't let the devil ever dictate to you
[59:55] what'll he think of what will she think
[59:57] forget about those kind of thoughts who
[1:00:00] you here to worship we're not her
[1:00:02] we're not here to worship one another
[1:00:04] we're not here to be to be man pleases
[1:00:07] or for other people to come pat you on
[1:00:08] the back and say oh that was wonderful I
[1:00:10] meant that's not why we gather we gather
[1:00:12] that God would come down hallelujah he
[1:00:15] would soften hearts he would trust
[1:00:17] closer to him I mean his his nature
[1:00:19] would come and become our nature
[1:00:21] hallelujah that everything we carry
[1:00:23] through the week we're washed by the
[1:00:25] water of the word the scripture says so
[1:00:27] the devil tries to put things on you
[1:00:29] during the week and you come in here the
[1:00:31] word and it washes us holy that's why
[1:00:33] eat sometimes we walk out of service me
[1:00:35] especially and you feel scared out you
[1:00:38] feel so light you're feeling so good
[1:00:40] because he because the people tries to
[1:00:42] put thee put things on you and
[1:00:45] subconsciously you hold on to those
[1:00:47] things and it becomes a grievous weight
[1:00:49] then he washes you then our God wash us
[1:00:51] and you feel so much better
[1:00:54] hallelujah it's how it should be you got
[1:00:58] to look at now how is your relationship
[1:01:01] how is it is it is it better than what
[1:01:05] it was initially or is it become stale
[1:01:08] has it become casual has it become
[1:01:12] indifferent
[1:01:14] how's your relationship with God has it
[1:01:17] become just your routine this is what I
[1:01:20] do
[1:01:21] hey we're creatures of habit as it's
[1:01:24] just a habit to read your Bible pray
[1:01:26] listen to the message come to church has
[1:01:29] just become habit or is it something now
[1:01:31] if it is that way
[1:01:32] they are in the desert they had to dig
[1:01:35] there was a rock there the rock that was
[1:01:39] smitten the wilderness that followed
[1:01:40] Israel that rock was still there which
[1:01:41] was Christ they had to dig he said make
[1:01:44] the valley full of ditches to get the
[1:01:46] water they are instructed dig it wasn't
[1:01:50] fortify yourselves and prepared for the
[1:01:51] attack dig that's what they had to do it
[1:01:55] wasn't get all the doctrines
[1:01:56] straightened out in the end and in all
[1:01:58] those things dig you got to dig you want
[1:02:02] to take you have to impress dig a me off
[1:02:06] but God will do it for me no you have to
[1:02:08] say take it Lord I don't want this I
[1:02:10] don't want to be in this condition
[1:02:12] anymore I don't want to be indifferent
[1:02:14] to you I don't want to be indifferent to
[1:02:15] my to my brothers and sisters I want to
[1:02:18] go back to my first love that's thinking
[1:02:20] that's thinking because if you really if
[1:02:23] you're serious and you begin to pray say
[1:02:25] Lord I don't you know any and you feel
[1:02:28] broken and you really sincerely from
[1:02:30] your heart say take this from me and
[1:02:32] then that's digging that's digging if
[1:02:35] you hold on to it that's not digging how
[1:02:40] much water do you want do you want a
[1:02:43] trickle do you want nothing do you just
[1:02:46] want the idea of water
[1:02:47] I don't want theory I want reality
[1:02:50] Christianity is a reality it's not a
[1:02:53] theory it's not a nice idea I mean when
[1:02:56] he is the rock that was smitten amen he
[1:02:58] is the bread of life that came down out
[1:03:00] of heaven that was a reality I mean when
[1:03:03] he was wounded for my transgressions his
[1:03:05] iniquities was upon me the chastisement
[1:03:07] of his peace you know you know of my
[1:03:10] peace was upon him by His stripes I was
[1:03:12] healed
[1:03:12] that's not theory that's a reality it's
[1:03:15] going to be a real thing hallelujah he's
[1:03:17] broken down every wall that's going to
[1:03:19] be a real thing
[1:03:20] hallelujah that he's not a it's not a
[1:03:22] theory don't let it be a theory don't
[1:03:26] let it just be a song with some
[1:03:28] scripture that you put on your fridge or
[1:03:30] or you post on wherever it's got to be a
[1:03:32] reality hallelujah and I'm glad that it
[1:03:37] is a reality amen when when when the
[1:03:41] first age the Ephesian age was rebuked
[1:03:43] because thou has left one thing I hold
[1:03:45] against you thou has left thy first love
[1:03:48] that was the main problem in their walk
[1:03:51] I don't want that to be my main problem
[1:03:54] on my walk thou has left thy first love
[1:03:58] what happens when your first lovers left
[1:04:00] it just becomes something you do and it
[1:04:03] becomes a drudgery and it's not alive
[1:04:05] and it's not wonderful you say well are
[1:04:08] you going by feelings if you love
[1:04:10] someone you feel it if you enjoy being
[1:04:13] around them there's something you just
[1:04:15] you feel it right we don't go by
[1:04:19] feelings but the love brings the
[1:04:20] feelings and then they're right faith
[1:04:23] does bring feelings but we don't go my
[1:04:25] feelings I mean you understand that
[1:04:28] peace when you get the Peace of passes
[1:04:30] all understanding that is a feeling but
[1:04:33] you don't go walking by the fact you
[1:04:35] have that feeling but it comes you
[1:04:38] understand what I'm saying if you're
[1:04:39] full of joy it's not something you just
[1:04:42] put on you really feel the joy I mean
[1:04:45] the joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:04:46] you really feel that joy that's a
[1:04:50] reality he says thou has left thy first
[1:04:54] love
[1:04:55] what happened something came in an
[1:04:58] Indies Christ spirit came in and it
[1:05:01] tried to make the church formal weak and
[1:05:04] powerless and it went from the blazing
[1:05:07] fire of Pentecost and have cooled down
[1:05:09] into a form we don't want that
[1:05:12] that's not our portion Amen but if we if
[1:05:16] we want to really possess that of not
[1:05:20] leaving our first love we got to dig
[1:05:23] we've got to dig we're gonna dig friends
[1:05:26] there's a rock it can be covered up by
[1:05:29] all things of life which is just a bunch
[1:05:32] of sand that has no foundation and you
[1:05:35] can't you can't satisfy your thirst and
[1:05:38] a desert when you have no water and this
[1:05:41] there's a desert I mean I'm just gonna
[1:05:44] speak this is just how it's gonna be
[1:05:46] you go to dig they hate to dig a mint
[1:05:50] and they did not stop digging and I
[1:05:53] believe you know we don't just want to
[1:05:54] dig in and and uncover a little bit of
[1:05:57] the Rock of Ages which is Christ have a
[1:05:59] little bit of water we should just you
[1:06:02] just where you say well well I've hit
[1:06:03] the rock then keep digging keep don't
[1:06:07] just get rid of the malleus get rid of
[1:06:09] the strife give her the envy get rid of
[1:06:12] the bitterness keep thinking it out get
[1:06:14] rid of the formality get rid of just the
[1:06:16] casual approach to the whole thing just
[1:06:19] take it all out get rid of the
[1:06:21] indifference keep the keep digging to
[1:06:23] the whole rockers uncovered hallelujah
[1:06:26] that's what we're called to do and we
[1:06:27] have the ability to do it I mean our
[1:06:30] relationship with god should be so
[1:06:32] wonderful hallelujah it should never
[1:06:35] plateaus or become indifferent or cold I
[1:06:38] haven't done the devil blows cold wind
[1:06:40] into your life it's not our portion
[1:06:43] don't stand for it don't put up with it
[1:06:45] for a second I mean if you begin to feel
[1:06:48] like you're cooling off say God relight
[1:06:50] the fire come and mold me keep my hat I
[1:06:53] don't want a concrete house I want to
[1:06:55] haunt this like it's got like a baby
[1:06:57] skin on it so soft and supple that he
[1:06:59] can just take it in his hand and just
[1:07:01] one small movement of his finger and my
[1:07:04] whole life has changed he doesn't have
[1:07:06] to get a sledgehammer and begin to begin
[1:07:08] to work on me just just one little touch
[1:07:10] of his finger and everything's different
[1:07:14] that's how it's got to be friends we
[1:07:16] need to dig they had a rock we need to
[1:07:22] dig as your walk with God going this
[1:07:25] year not talking about trials not talk
[1:07:29] about while I'm in a trial I'm out of a
[1:07:30] trial know your relationship with him
[1:07:33] what's your it's an actually trials that
[1:07:36] that that doesn't matter we all have
[1:07:39] trials God uses a trial to mold our
[1:07:41] character I wouldn't worry about them
[1:07:44] just because you're in a trial doesn't
[1:07:46] mean your relationships bet just because
[1:07:48] you're out of a child doesn't mean your
[1:07:50] relationships good but how is it through
[1:07:52] the trial how is it every day
[1:07:55] how's your how's your relationship are
[1:07:58] you soft and subtle and pliable in his
[1:08:01] hand
[1:08:02] hey that way or you had and calloused
[1:08:05] and just you won't move because that
[1:08:08] that's a wall but this person did it to
[1:08:13] me Jesus was that he was the meekest man
[1:08:15] now Moses at his time was the meekest
[1:08:18] man all the earth that was Christ in him
[1:08:20] Jesus that was a portion of Christ in
[1:08:23] him but then the fullness of God here
[1:08:25] bodily a man became flesh he and Jesus
[1:08:29] was the meekest man all the earth he was
[1:08:32] on the cross he wasn't calloused he
[1:08:35] wasn't hard he says I always do the will
[1:08:39] of my father I always do that which
[1:08:41] pleases him there's no gulf between him
[1:08:44] and God you know but remember as a man
[1:08:46] because he was a man he was fully God
[1:08:49] but he's fully meant
[1:08:50] there's no gulf between him and God he
[1:08:52] didn't he didn't wander off the path and
[1:08:54] then God had to come and you know get a
[1:08:56] hold of him and bring him back on the
[1:08:57] path again he was you say but I'm in
[1:09:01] this I've been this fallen flesh we are
[1:09:04] in this fallen flesh but that's why he
[1:09:06] has a blood that's why he has you're his
[1:09:09] Holy Ghost in you I trust I mean to keep
[1:09:12] this thing we have to die daily we have
[1:09:16] to surrender everything we have out of
[1:09:20] sincerity to God all of our thoughts our
[1:09:23] ambitions this thing has to stay in
[1:09:26] subject and it's not you
[1:09:29] keeping it in subject there's a big
[1:09:31] difference it sounds quite quite similar
[1:09:32] oh we have to keep it in subject but
[1:09:34] it's not your ability that keeps it in
[1:09:36] subject it's being surrendered to his
[1:09:39] Holy Spirit because if you take the
[1:09:41] reins you're going to end up in the
[1:09:43] ditch and you have to be calling more
[1:09:45] than the AAA to get you out but if he
[1:09:49] has hold of the reins
[1:09:50] then it's totally different different
[1:09:53] walk and he's good because we can easily
[1:09:57] take them back that's why Paul says lay
[1:10:00] aside every weight and sin that's so
[1:10:03] easily beset suss easily besets us
[1:10:08] lay them aside we call the lay things
[1:10:10] aside a distance between you and God
[1:10:16] will manifest in different ways in your
[1:10:18] life your character will be different
[1:10:20] your relationship with your family will
[1:10:23] be different and it won't be better
[1:10:24] it'll be worse and many people they can
[1:10:28] give very hard and harsh and very
[1:10:31] domineering and many times that is
[1:10:35] actually because their walk with God is
[1:10:36] not good and they're trying to hold on
[1:10:39] they're trying to keep it all together
[1:10:41] sometimes we've got to fall apart
[1:10:43] sometimes we have to fall apart we
[1:10:46] actually have to because he takes us and
[1:10:49] he heavy ever see ever seen a vessel
[1:10:52] someone's molding clay shaping of us but
[1:10:55] then they just pick it up they throw it
[1:10:57] back onto the wheel and they begin to
[1:10:58] mold it again sometimes it has to happen
[1:11:03] it's not a bad thing it's actually a
[1:11:07] very good thing but the thing is clay
[1:11:10] has no free moral agency it's just clay
[1:11:13] you have a choice he picks you up I'm
[1:11:17] gonna throw you on the wheel and if you
[1:11:19] say no okay I'll put you on the shelf
[1:11:22] and then you sit and clay sits there and
[1:11:25] it becomes dried out and becomes hard
[1:11:28] and it becomes brittle it doesn't become
[1:11:31] flexible anymore that's what clay does
[1:11:34] we are like into clay but then the
[1:11:38] master comes again he doesn't want
[1:11:40] remember he is the fountain he is the
[1:11:42] inexhaustible fountain how much of the
[1:11:45] fountain do you want in your life how
[1:11:47] close to him do you want to be he's
[1:11:49] broken down every every every Gulf his
[1:11:52] blood puts us on speaking terms again
[1:11:54] but you don't want the you don't want
[1:11:56] the relationship to be like strained or
[1:11:59] under tension we all am i all speaking
[1:12:03] someone's language this morning you
[1:12:05] don't want it to be strained intense and
[1:12:07] you know I'm gonna do my thing and this
[1:12:09] is how it's gonna be and you know we
[1:12:12] don't want it to be like that we want it
[1:12:15] to be like this
[1:12:17] this is the age where man becomes one
[1:12:20] with God and it's not ten years away
[1:12:23] it's now 2018 why did he die on the
[1:12:27] cross that God and man would be
[1:12:29] reconciled that would become one that's
[1:12:32] what he wants us to be now they had to
[1:12:36] dig and it was their digging which got
[1:12:39] them the victory where we have I won't
[1:12:45] be too much longer to be honest he says
[1:12:48] this we've riddled us now another thing
[1:12:51] about a lamb we have to be lambs
[1:12:53] remember another thing the lamb is the
[1:12:56] lamb is willing to submit its rights now
[1:12:58] this isn't the church in its condition
[1:13:00] if you even want to hear a service and
[1:13:02] you say Lord check me up according to
[1:13:05] this one you go listen to this one
[1:13:07] because he doesn't put it out there he
[1:13:09] brings it in here
[1:13:10] the church and its condition what is
[1:13:12] your condition this morning I'm not
[1:13:14] trying to I just want you to think about
[1:13:16] let's be sober-minded
[1:13:18] Lord how we doing he's always doing real
[1:13:22] good
[1:13:23] but how are you doing in the
[1:13:24] relationship he doesn't he doesn't have
[1:13:27] to say sorry and make things right he's
[1:13:29] already made things right
[1:13:30] he died on Calvary to make things right
[1:13:32] when you could not go to where he was he
[1:13:34] came to you hallelujah so it's errand
[1:13:38] it's our in Lord Oh am I going my own
[1:13:41] way presuming that that that you'll with
[1:13:44] me we don't just want to be caught up in
[1:13:47] tradition this this can become a
[1:13:49] tradition oh we have church and we have
[1:13:52] prayer meeting we have church and we
[1:13:53] have camp and we you know if you had
[1:13:55] this service and this one and this one
[1:13:57] it can become a tradition it's got a
[1:13:59] there's got to be something of the word
[1:14:01] that anchors in your soul
[1:14:02] it's got to be alive we're eating in
[1:14:04] something I mean it's like you have a
[1:14:06] real good meal it's wonderful and
[1:14:08] there's something in you you enjoy it it
[1:14:11] should be the same thing this now some
[1:14:13] day we will eat because it's just like
[1:14:15] energy to them that's fine if you're in
[1:14:18] that category that's fine okay but some
[1:14:21] people they love to eat and they love
[1:14:24] the flavors the the symphony of flavor
[1:14:26] you know
[1:14:28] now the
[1:14:30] is not just fuel you just eat it too
[1:14:34] this is a symphony of flavor a little
[1:14:37] earlier brother Andy but but if it
[1:14:41] becomes just fuel there's something
[1:14:43] wrong I mean it should be this is this
[1:14:47] is a life this is eternal life and if I
[1:14:50] had a message book I'll put them
[1:14:51] together because to me it's the same
[1:14:52] thing the message reveals Christ in here
[1:14:54] it's not a different it's not a
[1:14:56] different thing and so this is eternal
[1:14:59] life in print this is God do you know
[1:15:01] this is God in print form this is God in
[1:15:03] print form doesn't matter what people
[1:15:05] say about translation God is in these
[1:15:06] words God is in these words and if you
[1:15:09] and faith take this into your heart
[1:15:11] you'll see it manifest this is this is
[1:15:14] there's no book like this book there is
[1:15:18] no book like this book but to you FFT
[1:15:21] you it's like any other book how's your
[1:15:23] relationship with God amen
[1:15:26] because if it's just like another book
[1:15:29] then something's wrong but if it's
[1:15:32] something if it's wonderful I I love to
[1:15:35] read the girls well we'll get back to
[1:15:37] that I love this sometimes when I read
[1:15:39] the girls of bedtime story picture Bible
[1:15:42] I enjoy it more than they do
[1:15:44] and we worried about the resurrection I
[1:15:48] wish I should just bring the picture of
[1:15:50] it and and Mary's there and she comes to
[1:15:53] the tomb the tomb is open she and she
[1:15:57] comes in with the other woman and
[1:15:58] there's the angel sitting there he's not
[1:16:00] here he's risen they run off she comes
[1:16:03] out weeping and broken and there's a man
[1:16:05] standing there hallelujah and and he
[1:16:09] says why do you weep why do you weep
[1:16:12] what's wrong what's wrong with you you
[1:16:15] know because she she had a relationship
[1:16:16] with this Jesus - but things of life
[1:16:19] changed and she didn't know what was
[1:16:21] going on and she is weeping why do you
[1:16:24] weep and she turns around looks him in
[1:16:26] the eyes and she thinks he's a gardener
[1:16:29] tell me where you've taken his body and
[1:16:31] I'll carry him away oh I don't think she
[1:16:35] couldn't maybe you would have been
[1:16:36] pretty hard to drag her body around but
[1:16:38] that was her I want to take this this
[1:16:40] one I don't know what's happened to him
[1:16:42] but I want to take him with
[1:16:43] me carry him away and she he says one
[1:16:46] word Mary and her eyes come open it's
[1:16:49] you it's the lawn I love that picture I
[1:16:53] should shut to you one day but it's more
[1:16:55] than emotion it means a lot to me
[1:16:58] because that was a prophecy the Rays of
[1:17:01] death bear resurrection was a prophecy
[1:17:03] and we're living out the fulfillment of
[1:17:05] that prophecy I mean where the world
[1:17:07] does the world will do what it will do
[1:17:09] but here comes the resurrected Jesus
[1:17:11] hallelujah and he comes by your way
[1:17:14] oh man you shouldn't if you just feel
[1:17:16] indifferent about this eye you should
[1:17:18] pray say God make this alive to me I
[1:17:21] mean this means the world to me here
[1:17:23] comes our God he steps out of history he
[1:17:26] steps out of his word hallelujah and he
[1:17:28] proves himself Here I am I've come to
[1:17:31] speak to you I mean nothing you'd learn
[1:17:33] a bunch of stuff I mean but you'd become
[1:17:35] one with me hallelujah that when the
[1:17:38] time comes you'll walk from this this
[1:17:40] dimension into the next dimension
[1:17:42] hallelujah isn't that wonderful isn't
[1:17:45] that glorious I mean that God when this
[1:17:48] world is falling apart
[1:17:49] there's atomic bombs hanging and did
[1:17:51] they're in missiles they're all over the
[1:17:53] world they're gonna they're gonna be let
[1:17:54] loose one day I mean this you know a
[1:17:57] great the Great Tribulation is going to
[1:18:00] see it in the Prophet told us that World
[1:18:03] War 2 was just like an amateur
[1:18:05] tribulation and that was a horrible
[1:18:07] thing that was it just as a amateur
[1:18:11] thing what's happened when it's going to
[1:18:14] be the real thing but we're not called
[1:18:17] to go into that we're not called to go
[1:18:21] into that he's come he is here his
[1:18:24] everything he is apart from his physical
[1:18:27] body is here upon the earth we got to
[1:18:29] meet his physical body in the year but
[1:18:31] his spirit is here his spirit is here
[1:18:33] everything he is is here my bridegroom

[1:18:42] King is here I mean we don't need to
[1:18:44] wait to to crown him king of kings and
[1:18:46] Lord of lords over there we can crown
[1:18:48] them now amen

[1:20:08] looking for a way out I mean I found my
[1:20:11] way in and there's a fountain holy it
[1:20:13] isn't an exhaustible fountain and I've
[1:20:15] been drinking from the fountain and it
[1:20:17] just gets more glorious every day

[1:21:05] privilege when the devil fights you

[1:25:23] through some very dark places yes Lord
[1:25:25] even through the valley of the shadow of
[1:25:27] death but I fear no evil because
[1:25:29] with me hallelujah isn't that right
[1:25:34] hallelujah now that's what the matter
[1:25:38] with our churches today and the great
[1:25:39] majority that the gentleness of the Lamb
[1:25:42] of God we're supposed to be lambs but
[1:25:45] we've become everything else but lamps
[1:25:47] and that's the reason as soon as we get
[1:25:49] that attitude the spirit of the Dove of
[1:25:52] the Holy Spirit takes her flight and
[1:25:54] leaves when you know the Lamb he takes
[1:25:59] his flight and leaves now you don't want
[1:26:02] to get used to that they were seven days
[1:26:05] in the desert that's a long time but
[1:26:08] this it's a hot place and very cold at
[1:26:10] night they got acclimatize to being in
[1:26:12] the desert oh but now we have no water
[1:26:15] that's a long time to go isn't it with
[1:26:18] animals
[1:26:19] soldiers everything but they got used to
[1:26:21] it Joseph and Mary they win a few days
[1:26:24] without Jesus oh where has he gone we
[1:26:27] have to go back where we left them don't
[1:26:31] get acclimatized what did he do and
[1:26:35] there's nothing now this is me but I
[1:26:37] believe it's very true you can't justify
[1:26:39] being distance from God you cannot
[1:26:42] justify it doesn't matter what anyone
[1:26:44] has done to your seed or whatever or
[1:26:46] hearsay or gossip or whatever it doesn't
[1:26:48] matter nothing can justify you being
[1:26:51] distant from God because you put that
[1:26:53] thing above your relationship with
[1:26:55] Christ
[1:26:56] who you who do you have a relationship
[1:26:58] with do you have relationship with
[1:27:00] gossip and malice and strife and envying
[1:27:03] and pain and hurt is that the one you
[1:27:05] are united to it's did all that die on
[1:27:09] Calvary for you amen did that create the
[1:27:12] world did that before the foundation of
[1:27:15] world chose you in him no Jesus did the
[1:27:20] Word of God did
[1:27:31] my best an update oh there we go oh yes
[1:27:34] it's Spanish on the bottom sorry
[1:27:37] now it says here and that's the reason
[1:27:40] today that we're wondering what's the
[1:27:42] matter with the Pentecostal church now
[1:27:45] it's because we've taken on a different
[1:27:47] nature we've taken our nature that we
[1:27:50] want our rights we're going to do what
[1:27:52] we know that's right to do and we become
[1:27:55] arrogant arrogancy manifests in
[1:27:58] different ways right we become arrogant
[1:28:02] we become hostile we become indifferent
[1:28:05] we let temper come in we let selfishness
[1:28:08] come in how's your walk with God we are
[1:28:16] no different member we are men and women
[1:28:18] like any other men and woman any other
[1:28:21] every other age had their battles every
[1:28:24] age had their bells we're not exempt
[1:28:25] just because the mystery of God has
[1:28:28] finished in this day the son of man has
[1:28:30] been revealed the seals are open you
[1:28:33] know all those things all those
[1:28:35] wonderful things that men have been
[1:28:37] looking for to manifest and now here
[1:28:39] just the book is open all those things
[1:28:42] have happened just because that's
[1:28:43] happened doesn't mean we're exempt from
[1:28:46] the works of the enemy that doesn't give
[1:28:48] us a free pass the enemy has always
[1:28:52] fought the believer he didn't quit when
[1:28:55] Moses walked into Egypt saying let my
[1:28:57] people go he he just turned up the heat
[1:29:00] more Pharaoh's heart was hardened I will
[1:29:03] not let them go and you go all the way
[1:29:06] through the scripture the devil doesn't
[1:29:08] just you know as soon as God comes on
[1:29:10] the scene he doesn't just get a white
[1:29:11] flag and say I give up you're gonna win
[1:29:13] he he fights all the more and he's the
[1:29:17] same the devil is actually he doesn't
[1:29:19] change so we're not exempt from these
[1:29:23] things I'm gonna finish with that we
[1:29:28] don't want a difference to come in or
[1:29:31] temper or selfishness if you have those
[1:29:35] things in your life where you become
[1:29:37] hostile or arrogant I'll say and this is
[1:29:39] from personal experience if you have
[1:29:41] those things in your life God has
[1:29:43] lift your your carnal nature has come
[1:29:46] back to the forefront again and the Dove
[1:29:49] is taking its flight that's why you have
[1:29:52] to have a real repentance from your
[1:29:54] heart and the Dove will come back again
[1:29:56] I it is what it is so now I'm just gonna
[1:30:03] leave you with that question how is your
[1:30:06] walk with God today how's it doing I'm
[1:30:10] not talking about trials and what's
[1:30:11] going on how's your relationship is it
[1:30:15] better than it was or have you become
[1:30:17] indifferent and cool and it's just
[1:30:20] become what you do if it is you don't
[1:30:23] have to stay that way and you're welcome
[1:30:26] to come for prayer or just pray in your
[1:30:29] seat but if you want deliverance from
[1:30:31] something you're more than welcome to
[1:30:32] come for prayer and I'm gonna place
[1:30:35] myself on the altar too so this just bow
[1:30:37] heads in a word of Prayer and if you
[1:30:40] want to come forward you're welcome but
[1:30:42] let's just pray all together
[1:30:44] gracious father Lord you are the Lamb of
[1:30:48] God and father we have to have the same
[1:30:51] nature as you Lord that that you can
[1:30:55] abide Lord we want to sing truly hereby

[1:31:07] thank you Lord that that song is a
[1:31:08] reality Lord God we thank you you abide

[1:31:14] we we do grieve you and Lord out of
[1:31:18] situations of life and you take your
[1:31:20] flight waiting for us to come back to
[1:31:23] that spot where we left you Lord we
[1:31:26] don't want to walk many days farther
[1:31:28] without feeling your spirit without
[1:31:31] feeling tender and and feeling that love
[1:31:34] Lord there's something about you Lord
[1:31:36] when you come Lord and and you speak to
[1:31:39] our hearts and Lord you move upon our
[1:31:41] lives and but father when we're distant
[1:31:44] from your Lord that doesn't happen that
[1:31:46] way and it just goes all up into our
[1:31:48] head
[1:31:49] and father I just pray for each one here
[1:31:52] Lord may we break up that fellow ground
[1:31:54] Lord may we dig

[1:31:58] real heartfelt repentance
[1:32:00] father I pray you be merciful to each
[1:32:02] one here Lord we wanna we just want to
[1:32:05] walk with you hand in hand no because if
[1:32:08] you're with us Lord all of the hardness
[1:32:10] and trials of life it doesn't matter
[1:32:13] Lord if we know that you are with us
[1:32:16] Lord it means the world so I pray for
[1:32:19] each one here
