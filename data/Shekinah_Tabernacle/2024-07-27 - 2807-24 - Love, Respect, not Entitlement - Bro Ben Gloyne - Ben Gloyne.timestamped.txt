[39:03] 33 and um I got a few things together
[39:05] I'm just kind of trusting the Lord will
[39:08] put it all together just right amen we
[39:09] enjoyed the service on Wednesday and um
[39:12] amen Our God's
[39:14] working hallelujah amen so we thank the
[39:17] Lord amen so we reading from Ephesians
[39:19] 5: 20 down to 33 giving thanks always
[39:22] for all things unto God and the father
[39:24] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[39:26] submitting elves one to another in the
[39:28] fear of God wives submit yourselves unto
[39:31] your own husbands as unto the Lord for
[39:33] the husband is the head of the wife even
[39:35] as Christ as the head of the church and
[39:37] he is the savior of the body therefore
[39:39] as the C sorry therefore as the church
[39:42] is subject unto Christ so let the wives
[39:44] be to their own husbands and everything
[39:47] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[39:49] also loved the church and gave himself
[39:51] for it that he might sanctify and
[39:53] cleanse it with the washing by the of
[39:55] the Water by the word that he might
[39:57] present it to himself a glorious church
[39:59] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[40:02] thing but that it should be holy and
[40:04] without blemish so ought men to love
[40:06] their wives as their own bodies he that
[40:08] loveth his wife loveth himself for no
[40:11] man ever yet hateth his own flesh but
[40:14] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[40:17] Lord the church for we are members of
[40:20] his body and of his flesh and of his
[40:22] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[40:24] his father and mother and shall be
[40:25] joined unto his wife and and they too
[40:28] shall be one flesh this is a great
[40:30] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[40:33] and the church nevertheless let every
[40:35] one of you in particular so love his
[40:37] wife even as himself and the wife see
[40:39] that she reverence her husband now this
[40:42] is not just for married people today
[40:44] okay hallelujah we're all involved in
[40:46] this amen so let's bow our heads in a
[40:48] word of prayer this morning you want to
[40:49] be remembered in prayed you want to slip

[41:14] healing and restoration and father we're
[41:17] in your presence this morning Lord so I
[41:19] pray you'll just take complete control
[41:21] for your glory Lord every Spirit that's
[41:22] not of you may it be bound in the name
[41:24] of Jesus Christ father may you have such
[41:26] Liberty all of our hearts Lord we open
[41:28] our hearts to you that you would do what
[41:30] you want done father in the name of
[41:32] Jesus Christ Lord that You' be glorified
[41:35] Lord we love you we thank you be with
[41:36] those who couldn't be here today Father
[41:38] be their abundant portion too Lord
[41:40] remember brother Phil in hospital Lord
[41:42] in the rehab continue to touch his body
[41:43] and raise him up father and anyone else
[41:46] who's sick who's not here Lord be their
[41:47] portion too Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[41:50] amen amen God bless you friends you can
[41:53] have your seats uh this morning so I'm
[41:55] going to speak about love respect and
[41:57] entitlement and we'll get to all those
[41:59] I'm going to behave today actually get
[42:00] to all of them today so now we are we
[42:03] are reading here you know it's amazing
[42:05] the Apostle Paul where where he would
[42:07] come down and speak about husbands and
[42:10] wives and and and paralleling it to
[42:12] Christ and the church and and and if you
[42:14] look into the Apostle Paul's writings he
[42:16] uses this word mystery quite a few times
[42:19] he uses it mainly in the book of
[42:21] Ephesians but there's only one thing
[42:23] that he calls a great mystery and that
[42:25] is and that is the Union between husband
[42:28] and wife representing Christ and his
[42:29] bride so if if now I believe when the
[42:33] Apostle Paul wrote these words it wasn't
[42:35] him writing it it was almighty God so if
[42:37] it was almighty God writing this and
[42:39] he's emphasizing this as a great mystery
[42:41] then I think we should pay attention to
[42:42] these things amen so it's very important
[42:45] that we look into these and you know we
[42:46] see because we got to understand that
[42:48] you know it's amazing that the Apostle
[42:50] Paul well actually God would put his
[42:52] finger on this and he would you know
[42:54] because you think about it when you talk
[42:56] about marriage you talk about the Christ
[42:58] in his church and you know he could he
[43:00] could um put a lot of different uh
[43:03] Commandments or words you know
[43:04] instructions to give but he placed it on
[43:07] two things men love your wives as Christ
[43:10] loved the church H wives amen give
[43:13] reverence to your husband submitting but
[43:16] you see now the the the instruction
[43:18] really begins out by submitting
[43:20] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[43:22] the Lord so so it takes two for this
[43:25] picture to be complete and and how we
[43:28] fulfill out because remember we've got
[43:29] scripture to fulfill and these
[43:31] scriptures that we read it's really up
[43:33] to say you know it's not me to to to to
[43:37] put this upon my wife saying you've got
[43:38] to submit you've got to reverence me you
[43:40] got to obey no that's her scripture to
[43:42] fulfill right that's the the you know
[43:46] that's her commission my commission is
[43:48] to love her as Christ loved the church
[43:51] amen right so we've got to fulfill our
[43:53] scriptures see there's a lot of
[43:54] scriptures we don't want to fulfill we
[43:57] want to be gossips we don't want to be
[43:59] busy bodies we don't want to be proud
[44:01] arrogant blasphemers we don't want to
[44:02] fulfill any of that scripture we want to
[44:04] fulfill this scripture amen we want to
[44:07] so there's some things you want to avoid
[44:09] like the plague in the Bible right but
[44:11] there's some scripture you say Lord May
[44:13] ody that because someone's going to live
[44:15] this someone's going to live it see God
[44:17] wants a people that live his word or
[44:20] they allow his word to live through them
[44:21] so someone's going to fulfill this so I
[44:23] say Lord here I am make me live it Lord
[44:26] cause me delivered amen so so this is a
[44:30] great mystery now so we're to submit
[44:33] ourselves one to another the reason I
[44:36] believe that the Apostle Paul would put
[44:38] these two things down as as as husband
[44:40] um husbands love love your wives as
[44:43] Christ loved the church is because he's
[44:45] saying these are the more the more
[44:47] difficult things to
[44:50] do it's easy for a man to go get a job
[44:53] and
[44:55] provide some of the gener older
[44:57] generation saying
[44:59] amen but it's easy to get a job it's
[45:01] easy to go through the motions and you
[45:03] know have a home and provide and work
[45:05] and do those it's easy to go through the
[45:08] motions but where's your heart in it
[45:10] many times the Lord's dealt with me
[45:11] saying you have detached yourself from
[45:14] your family from your wife from from you
[45:17] know you you you're just going through
[45:18] the motion so it's easy to go through
[45:20] the motions but where's the love where's
[45:23] actually the you know your your all your
[45:26] attention all the that you are is upon
[45:28] them you see Samson Samson did not
[45:32] fulfill the scripture cuz he gave his
[45:34] heart to Delilah but he gave his
[45:36] strength to God it was easy for him to
[45:38] give his strength to God because it made
[45:40] him look good you see and it's easy for
[45:42] men they'll do things that make them
[45:44] look good look at me look at how great I
[45:46] am providing money whatever wealth and
[45:48] all these things but those are that's
[45:50] not the main thing you see brother
[45:52] Braham gave her two he gave two examples
[45:54] of two married couples one was a very
[45:56] rich married couple they were
[45:58] multi-millionaire families and all these
[46:00] things and another one they they they
[46:02] were living in a box car and he went and
[46:04] checked up on them and you know he
[46:07] slipped up to the rich house and he
[46:08] heard the fussing and the fighting
[46:09] before he probably even got on the
[46:11] section I don't know he knocks on the
[46:13] door you know and and he sees them start
[46:15] to start behaving and you they were
[46:16] fussing about the things they were doing
[46:18] the night before and you know but they
[46:20] they put on a pretense that all was
[46:22] well but then he went down to the
[46:24] Riverside and he and he and and and and
[46:27] he went to the box car where the very
[46:28] poor couple lived and she was sitting on
[46:31] his lap and they were going over the
[46:32] money they had and see his heart was in
[46:35] his wife all that he was was in his wife
[46:37] he wasn't just going through the motions
[46:39] to look good he said honey I saw that
[46:41] dress in the window I want to buy it for
[46:42] you and can we afford it they're doing
[46:43] all she he was involving her in all of
[46:46] his decisions see it wasn't her down
[46:49] here and he up here no he had a
[46:51] revelation that we are in this together
[46:53] we are joint ears together amen so you
[46:56] see he just give his strength to his
[46:58] wife or whatever he gave his heart he
[47:00] gave everything so he was loving he was
[47:03] loving uh her like Christ loves the
[47:06] church that's amen and then brother
[47:09] Braham slipped away from that didn't
[47:11] even go on the door he saw they happy he
[47:12] said now who was the rich man who was
[47:15] the who was the wealthy man he said I'd
[47:17] rather live in the Box Car and have that
[47:19] kind of a home that up there with the
[47:20] palace and have a fussing fighting kind
[47:22] of a problem you see so it's easy it's
[47:24] easy for men to give their strength but
[47:26] what about our heart
[47:27] what about you see you see man remember
[47:29] God before there was anything was alone
[47:31] with his thoughts and the de and
[47:34] remember man was made in the image of
[47:35] God that's right right the devil wants
[47:38] to put us men back alone with our
[47:40] thoughts that's right he doesn't want us
[47:42] to express ourselves as we should to our
[47:45] families to our loved ones right cuz God
[47:47] remember God's whole purpose was I want
[47:49] a family I want someone to share life
[47:51] with I want to walk with her I want to
[47:53] know her I want to express all that I am
[47:55] to her I want to build a build memories
[47:57] with her isn't that what he's done with
[47:59] you that's why he called you before you
[48:02] even knew you're a Believer knew you
[48:04] before you even knew God God knew you
[48:07] and he sought you out he found you you
[48:08] may have been raised on a Pew it doesn't
[48:10] matter where you from he found you he
[48:12] says I want to walk with you I want to
[48:14] know you I want to experience life with
[48:16] you I want to build memories with you
[48:18] amen and see this is God right this is
[48:20] what how God wanted to be now if that's
[48:22] how God is that's how men should be
[48:25] right give their lives give all that
[48:27] they are their whole ambition be Lord I
[48:30] want a family I want to I want to have a
[48:32] I want to build memories with with the
[48:35] other part of me but you see now it's
[48:37] amazing with the book of Ephesians
[48:39] because you know if you look at the book
[48:41] of Ephesians you know God writes things
[48:42] in a particular order and he would start
[48:44] in chapter one saying you know how they
[48:46] sealed to the day of their Redemption
[48:47] that he'd speak about Christ's position
[48:49] then it begin to speak about the
[48:51] believer's position it'd come into you
[48:53] know uh chapter 4 and he'd say about you
[48:55] know how there's the five-fold ministry
[48:56] till we come to the Statue of the
[48:58] perfect man and you know how we're the
[48:59] body of Christ then it comes down to
[49:01] chapter 5 we're just reading about the
[49:03] great mystery that's in marriage about
[49:05] Christ and his church then he goes into
[49:06] chapter six about putting on the whole
[49:08] armor of God now to me the order of this
[49:11] is very important because if you really
[49:12] want to use the armor to be the if you
[49:15] want to have the armor you've got to
[49:17] know your position right you got to know
[49:19] your position not just in Christ but
[49:21] also your your office in the home amen
[49:24] right it's very this is why it's a great
[49:26] mystery so you see so we can't just put
[49:29] these things over lightly we got to
[49:30] actually look into these things and say
[49:32] well a husband is actually a position as
[49:34] an office right and a wife is an office
[49:37] in a family too and if you can't respect
[49:40] the person in that office you've got to
[49:42] respect the office and you got to
[49:44] realize when you got married you you
[49:46] chose that person to be in that
[49:48] position whether you like oh well they
[49:51] don't they don't deserve it well you
[49:52] still put them in that position amen so
[49:55] and and they may be out of cada but you
[49:58] but you've got a responsibility Lord I
[50:00] want to possess the office if I'm going
[50:02] to be a husband I'm going to be a one
[50:03] that gives my whole life for my family
[50:05] I'm going to love them like you loved me
[50:07] Lord amen if I'm a wife well I'm going
[50:10] to be the best wife there is I'm going
[50:12] to fulfill I'm going to fulfill I'm
[50:13] going to if I can't respect the man I'll
[50:15] respect the office see this is an age
[50:17] where men are run down women run down
[50:19] marriages run down right just just made
[50:22] a common just a thing that's got no
[50:24] value to it but God puts great value
[50:26] upon it you see so we can't just we
[50:29] can't just look at these things and say
[50:31] Well it don't matter no it belong it it
[50:33] it very much matters you see if we go
[50:36] into um as I said here that you see that
[50:38] um see men need to have a revelation
[50:42] that their wives are part of
[50:43] them right you need to have that
[50:45] Revelation if you got a revelation that
[50:47] you're part of the word then you should
[50:50] have a revelation that your wife is part
[50:51] of you and vice versa of course you see
[50:54] we're not too like Christy and I we're
[50:56] not too people anymore we're
[50:59] one right you know uh well if I'm
[51:03] standing on toes I'm going to stand on
[51:04] them okay but you see now some some
[51:07] husbands get offended when visitors come
[51:09] to their house and their wife serves
[51:10] serves the visitors before them and I
[51:13] think that makes no sense because
[51:16] because if your wife is part of you then
[51:18] that's you
[51:19] serving the
[51:21] visitor amen so if the coffee if you're
[51:24] last in the coffee line praise God
[51:26] because you want to make your visitors
[51:27] feel welcome right but if you get
[51:29] offended well why is she paying
[51:31] particular attention to them and looking
[51:33] after them well that's your heart being
[51:36] expressed right so if you have a
[51:38] revelation you're one well what she does
[51:41] I do what he what I do she does
[51:44] Hallelujah prise the Lord we one
[51:47] baby you see but but you need that
[51:50] Revelation now this is you and Christ as
[51:52] well right CU you realize what he did
[51:54] you fallen near to amen amen he
[51:57] purchases your salvation on Calvary he's
[52:00] fallen a to All Things amen so so if he
[52:03] has fallen a to all things then I am a
[52:04] joint ear cuz we're
[52:07] one right we're not two we're not oh
[52:09] Lord I'm trying to earn something from
[52:10] you no no no no he earned it all now I
[52:12] get to enjoy it all because he earned it
[52:15] all amen you so you see this is very to
[52:18] me very important now I perh not
[52:20] glossing over these things but you see
[52:22] now it says now that the wife see that
[52:23] she reverence her husband now
[52:27] in the Bible in basic English he says
[52:29] yet I insist that um that among you also
[52:32] each men is to love his own wife as much
[52:35] as he loves himself if men don't love
[52:37] their wives they don't love
[52:39] themselves you actually detest your own
[52:42] self if you detest your wife if you push
[52:44] her down that's how you
[52:46] feel right if you're actually a person
[52:49] who is actually uh engrossed in yourself
[52:52] then you love your
[52:54] wife right if you're selfish don't love
[52:56] her like you really should love her
[52:58] right but if you're actually a
[52:59] self-absorbed person in the right way
[53:02] you love her and pour all your affection
[53:04] everything upon
[53:05] her all right and let a married woman
[53:08] see to it fit that she treats her
[53:10] husband with respect now isn't it
[53:13] interesting when you think about this
[53:14] where you know it's easy it's easy for
[53:17] us even you know now now this is just
[53:19] Believers too as well not just not just
[53:21] wives That's why I say it applies to
[53:22] everyone now it's easy to to raise our
[53:25] hands we had a tremendous ship service
[53:27] this
[53:27] morning it's easy to raise our hands and
[53:30] sin get caught up in the atmosphere and
[53:32] be blessed and feel touched but it's
[53:35] easy to do that easy to say that we love
[53:39] but where's the respect for God's word
[53:41] you see love love love human love is not
[53:44] God you know the love of God if we have
[53:47] a deep if we have a deep cc to reverence
[53:49] it means to have a deep respect for
[53:51] someone or something is to regard or
[53:53] treat it with deep respect and really
[53:56] think you if you really have a
[53:58] revelation what God has done for you how
[54:00] can you not treat him with utmost
[54:02] respect with utmost reverence because
[54:05] remember God's
[54:06] Sovereign God's Sovereign you didn't
[54:09] choose Jesus told his disciples I you
[54:11] didn't choose me I chose you yes sir
[54:14] right he made it very clear to them you
[54:16] did not choose me didn't matter what
[54:18] ambition you had what you wanted to be
[54:20] you whatever you whatever you thought
[54:22] you didn't choose me I chose you so if
[54:25] we have if we really realize that that
[54:28] God chose us amen he he said I'm going
[54:32] to choose them I'm going to look through
[54:34] time they're mine they're part of me
[54:37] they're coming home to me they're going
[54:38] to walk with me I'm going to know them
[54:40] because I have decided and when God
[54:43] decides something nothing can change his
[54:45] mind now if that anchors into our hearts
[54:47] I think God how can we not worship you
[54:49] because you are God we don't worship him
[54:52] because of the because of the blessings
[54:54] I just want him amen if if he never
[54:56] answers another prayer my whole life and
[54:58] everything goes totally to ruin I'll
[55:00] still love him cuz he is God Amen job
[55:03] worshiped God cuz God was God wasn't cuz
[55:06] he had the Hedge and the money the
[55:07] wealth and all those things no God was
[55:09] God that's why he worshiped him and we
[55:11] must be the same but this world is so
[55:14] entitled we'll come to it I was want to
[55:15] drop it in this world feels so
[55:17] entitled and we can't let that Spirit
[55:20] come in among you and I well I deserve
[55:23] something what do you deserve what do I
[55:24] deserve did I deserve deserve Heaven no
[55:27] did I deserve a Rapture absolutely not
[55:30] did I deserve overcoming power no but
[55:33] says I choose to give it to you
[55:36] Hallelujah so we should have a very deep
[55:39] respect for the word of God Amen Let
[55:42] Your worship you know worship actually
[55:44] in the Bible means actually a
[55:45] prostrating down means a bowing down
[55:48] that doesn't actually mean a singing
[55:49] singing is part of it but it's not

[58:37] and and he was sitting at the bar one
[58:39] day with some of his friends and the
[58:41] topic of Christianity came up and one of
[58:44] his friends said they're all Hypocrites
[58:46] there's no such thing as real Christians
[58:47] no more but he said just a minute
[58:51] there's one that I know well who's that
[58:53] it's my wife you see she became salty he
[58:57] was catching all the time he was
[58:59] catching it all the time maybe not lit

[59:02] the time why because she had a
[59:04] revelation he's my husband he's my head
[59:08] I'm going to reverence
[59:10] him right right so she was becoming
[59:15] salty and he said no she's still a

[59:18] prove it to you let's go home we act
[59:21] real drunk we ask for some food we'll
[59:23] just cause a bunch of trouble we'll
[59:24] cause a Ruckus right
[59:26] and then so they go home he said you
[59:28] they're acting all drunk sprawling
[59:29] around and all these things I'm not
[59:31] reading that but you can read it if you
[59:32] want I'm just I'm just telling you the
[59:34] story you know they come in the three of
[59:36] them or four of them all drunk acting
[59:38] they come in and he says I want some I
[59:40] want some bacon and eggs and so she goes
[59:42] in makes makes his his guests feel
[59:44] welcome first and you know puts them
[59:46] there and then and then you know she
[59:48] goes and Cooks the bacon eggs brings it
[59:49] out and you know he looks to that says
[59:51] you know you know I don't like them like
[59:53] that picks up the plate throws it
[59:55] against the wall
[59:57] now she's
[59:58] salty she has already made up her mind
[1:00:01] she made up her mind I'm going to be a
[1:00:03] real
[1:00:04] chrisan amen just like Jesus in The
[1:00:06] Garden of Gethsemane he didn't quit cuz
[1:00:08] things got too hard that's right
[1:00:10] whatever pain he had to feel he was
[1:00:11] going to feel it whatever anguish had to
[1:00:13] go he was going to go he already sold
[1:00:15] out Daniel shadra mesach when they
[1:00:18] left Jerusalem they said we're serving
[1:00:19] God what's going to happen don't know
[1:00:21] we're serving God right so so he threw
[1:00:24] the eggs against the wall he said come
[1:00:25] on boys just go out here and you know
[1:00:28] they were you they were they were they
[1:00:31] were there then they could hear hear her
[1:00:32] snubbing to herself and crying to
[1:00:34] herself singing in a real low voice must
[1:00:36] Jesus bear the cross alone and all the
[1:00:38] world go free there's a cross for
[1:00:40] everyone and there's a cross for me this
[1:00:42] consecrated cross I'll bear Till Death
[1:00:44] Shall Set Me Free and one drunk looked
[1:00:47] at the other she's a Christian she's got
[1:00:48] it amen you see we should not treat the
[1:00:53] other based on how they treat us that's
[1:00:56] not
[1:00:58] Christianity remember when we were yet
[1:01:00] the enemies of God how did he treat us
[1:01:03] true he went
[1:01:05] Calvary Hallelujah he bore our sin
[1:01:07] sorrow shame pain all those things upon
[1:01:09] himself and went up Calvary when we were
[1:01:12] his
[1:01:13] enemies amen so if that's how he if that
[1:01:17] if that's how he
[1:01:19] was how can how can we not reverence him
[1:01:21] and respect him but you see we should
[1:01:23] not treat each other treat family based
[1:01:26] on how they treat us sure there Comes A
[1:01:28] Time if you can't live peaceably all
[1:01:30] those things okay we won't go into those
[1:01:31] things now but you got to understand we
[1:01:33] should possess the office that we are
[1:01:35] ordained to stand in amen and we can't
[1:01:40] we can't live isolated within ourselves
[1:01:42] within a family we've got to realize
[1:01:44] that there's power in our positions now
[1:01:48] amen now Peter would say here he'd say
[1:01:51] likewise ye wives being subject to your
[1:01:53] own husbands that if they obey not the
[1:01:55] word they also May without the word be
[1:01:57] won by the conversation which is the
[1:01:59] manner of life of the wives while they
[1:02:01] behold your Chase conversation coupled
[1:02:03] with fear whose adoring let it not be
[1:02:05] with outward adoring of plating of the
[1:02:07] hair or wearing of gold or putting on of
[1:02:09] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[1:02:11] the heart and that which is not
[1:02:12] corruptible even the ornament of a meek
[1:02:14] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[1:02:17] of God of great price for after this
[1:02:19] manner in the old times the holy women
[1:02:21] also who trusted in God adorned
[1:02:24] themselves being subject to their own
[1:02:26] husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[1:02:28] calling him Lord whose daughters ye are
[1:02:30] as long as you do well and be Not Afraid
[1:02:33] with any amazement likewise he husbands
[1:02:35] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:02:38] don't just live in the same house dwell
[1:02:41] with them according to knowledge
[1:02:42] understand what or at least try to
[1:02:44] understand what they're going
[1:02:47] through that's half the battle one right
[1:02:49] there try and understand you say I don't
[1:02:52] understand the Men Are from Mars and
[1:02:54] women are from Venus well no but a yes
[1:02:56] in a way because we are different
[1:02:59] Spirits men have masculine Spirits women
[1:03:02] have feminist Spirits remember when Adam
[1:03:04] Adam was both inside he was both man and
[1:03:07] woman Eve was taken out of Adam not just
[1:03:10] a rib and then made into a body but but
[1:03:12] that feminine part of himself was
[1:03:14] expressed right and now men and women
[1:03:17] have two different
[1:03:20] brains we'll leave that there you can
[1:03:22] fill in the
[1:03:24] blanks but you see
[1:03:26] we must dwell with them according to
[1:03:27] knowledge men we can't dwell in our
[1:03:29] nothing box all the time we can't live
[1:03:32] at our nothing box all the time you say
[1:03:35] it's a comfort zone Comfort zones are
[1:03:37] dangerous man that's true Comfort zones
[1:03:39] are very dangerous they're actually
[1:03:40] foolish places to live in right we got
[1:03:42] to go beyond our comfort zone am because
[1:03:45] it's because it's when you go beyond the
[1:03:46] comfort zone that's when God can step in
[1:03:48] and take over in your life amen we must
[1:03:50] go beyond the comfort zone so we can't
[1:03:52] live at our nothing box all the time
[1:03:55] amen spend less time there that's right
[1:03:57] amen okay amen I agree with
[1:04:01] you
[1:04:03] hallelujah amen hey don't be afraid to
[1:04:06] say Amen do you want more from your
[1:04:08] spouse amen do you want a better
[1:04:10] relationship amen amen do you want more
[1:04:13] of them
[1:04:14] amen praise God so let's join in
[1:04:17] together shall we this is not
[1:04:18] pitchforking hey we're going to take
[1:04:19] ownership of the word we're going to let
[1:04:22] our part be fulfilled in our lives it's
[1:04:24] not well if they do this I do that no
[1:04:27] did Christ come to you and say uh are
[1:04:29] you going to serve
[1:04:30] me okay I'll die you I'll redeem you no
[1:04:33] he did it before you even knew anything
[1:04:35] about
[1:04:35] anything
[1:04:37] amen so dwell with them according to
[1:04:39] knowledge see we can't shut off and our
[1:04:41] nothing box and our phones we can't
[1:04:43] build a world to ourselves within our
[1:04:46] hearts we can't do that see we must
[1:04:48] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:04:49] you must at least try and understand
[1:04:51] what they're going through right and
[1:04:52] giving honor unto the wife you got to
[1:04:54] give honor to her yeah she's not a
[1:04:56] second class citizen we're not second
[1:04:59] class citizens in
[1:05:00] heaven we are joint ears with Christ
[1:05:03] amen so as high as he is we are as high
[1:05:05] as he is he has a name above every other
[1:05:08] name we're called by that name the name
[1:05:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ we're join is
[1:05:11] with Christ we're not second class
[1:05:13] citizens we're not under the law if
[1:05:16] you're a man who's actually under the
[1:05:17] law I'm in the message that means
[1:05:19] nothing that just means you're more
[1:05:20] responsible because you know the truth
[1:05:23] right but you see if a man is under the
[1:05:24] law his wife will be a second class
[1:05:26] citizen in the house she won't be shared
[1:05:29] with she won't be spoken to she'll just
[1:05:30] be woman know your
[1:05:32] place that place is join is with you you
[1:05:36] got to realize what her place really is
[1:05:38] you she is one with you that's her place
[1:05:41] just like our place is one with the Lord
[1:05:44] right are we all okay don't don't don't
[1:05:46] don't don't Cur your toes up in your
[1:05:48] shoes just just relax we'll get
[1:05:51] somewhere okay we're going to have lunch
[1:05:52] eventually just just just relax say God
[1:05:54] I want more of you
[1:05:56] amen cuz these things the issues of the
[1:05:58] heart are the biggest deal now in the
[1:06:00] end time it's the biggest thing in the
[1:06:02] end time our God sent a prophet we know
[1:06:04] that we we've received that oh baptized
[1:06:07] the name of Jesus Christ come on man one
[1:06:09] God of course right but it's the issues
[1:06:12] of the heart because it's the same thing
[1:06:14] in jesus' day people look the part they
[1:06:16] played the part but they weren't the
[1:06:18] part on the inside see and that is the
[1:06:20] thing with the foolish virgin they get
[1:06:21] left behind cuz they looked the part but
[1:06:23] they weren't the part on the inside they
[1:06:25] didn't have the oil on the inside they
[1:06:26] can quote the quotes quote the
[1:06:27] scriptures live the life to a degree but
[1:06:30] the issues of the heart need needed to
[1:06:32] be addressed every door had to come open
[1:06:35] so if you're getting frustrated husbands
[1:06:38] in your in your in your prayer life in
[1:06:40] your walk with God you've got a you're
[1:06:42] realizing your you got to realize your
[1:06:44] prayers are being hindered because of
[1:06:46] your conduct because of how you treat
[1:06:48] your wife like I said if you're under
[1:06:50] the law your wife will be a second class
[1:06:52] citizen because under the law women in
[1:06:55] isra were second class to the men right
[1:06:58] even when here I I've gone over these
[1:06:59] things but we but here we are again
[1:07:01] we're on repeat right so when when you
[1:07:04] know it was shown in the temple right
[1:07:06] the Gentiles could come a certain
[1:07:09] distance to the holy of holies but they
[1:07:11] couldn't come as close as the Israelite
[1:07:12] women who could come closer to the
[1:07:14] Gentiles but then they couldn't come as
[1:07:16] close as the men right and then after
[1:07:19] that was the priests they could come
[1:07:21] closer than everyone else and then it
[1:07:23] was of course the high priest going into
[1:07:24] the holy of holies once once a year
[1:07:26] right but it was showing there that the
[1:07:28] women were not were not on the same
[1:07:30] level as the men under the blood of
[1:07:32] balls and goats okay but you see under
[1:07:34] the blood of Jesus Christ there's not
[1:07:37] Jew or Gentile Greek free Bond whatever
[1:07:39] we're all one in Christ male female
[1:07:41] we're all one and isn't it amazing that
[1:07:44] Peter had to write these words because
[1:07:46] he was writing to the dispersed Jewish
[1:07:49] Believers and of course it applies to us
[1:07:50] today as well that you must dwell with
[1:07:53] them because according to knowledge
[1:07:55] because you are ears together in the
[1:07:57] grace of life so you're joint ear
[1:08:00] everything you've received she's
[1:08:02] received amen amen that your prayers see
[1:08:05] you see give give honor unto them as
[1:08:08] unto the wicked vessel as being eared
[1:08:10] together of the grace of life that your
[1:08:12] prayers be not
[1:08:13] hindered all right amen so we need
[1:08:18] to realize these things husbands love
[1:08:22] your wives as Christ loved the church
[1:08:24] I'm just having a brief conclusion
[1:08:26] before we go to part two okay husbands
[1:08:29] love your wives as Christ loved the
[1:08:32] church and gave himself for it so he
[1:08:34] didn't say husbands provide and that's
[1:08:37] it husbands live in the same house but
[1:08:39] live a separate life from your wife he
[1:08:41] didn't say that he said love her as
[1:08:44] Christ has loved you and gave himself
[1:08:48] right so really nothing wrong with
[1:08:51] Hobbies okay but what should be your
[1:08:53] main Hobby in life family
[1:08:59] wife oh my we're gonna have a series I
[1:09:02] think not living to your own self part I

[1:11:01] when when when Samuel came to J's house

[1:11:06] just been the annoying little brother
[1:11:08] but he had God on his side he was
[1:11:10] ordained to be king amen that did not
[1:11:13] stop him fulfilling his scripture amen
[1:11:16] the prophet came out of a Bootlegger's
[1:11:18] family no religion whatsoever did that

[1:14:52] yeah so let let let's let us let God
[1:14:56] change us that this is not us
[1:15:01] hallelujah see
[1:15:03] them now I just want to put this and we
[1:15:06] kind of go we're kind of going towards
[1:15:07] entitlement now we've kind of summed up
[1:15:10] fulfill your scripture right fulfill
[1:15:12] your
[1:15:14] scripture wives reverence respect your
[1:15:17] husbands as you do the word of God I say
[1:15:21] if you don't respect if you don't love
[1:15:22] your wife you don't love God in a Godly
[1:15:25] way right if you don't respect your
[1:15:27] husband you don't respect the
[1:15:30] word
[1:15:32] right but you see this world has been
[1:15:34] conditioned that this has become very
[1:15:36] much the
[1:15:37] norm he says Moses give away to that
[1:15:40] what did he give away to and he set his
[1:15:42] faith and his faith paralyzed the world
[1:15:44] world he gave away to the prophecy that
[1:15:47] he was ordained to fulfill he says
[1:15:49] either your faith will paralyze glamour
[1:15:51] or either the glamour will paralyze your
[1:15:53] faith so this world that shiny things
[1:15:55] will either paralyze your faith or your
[1:15:57] faith will paralyze its influence in you
[1:16:00] which one do you want I want to be a
[1:16:02] Moses I want to be a believer that the
[1:16:05] faith of God in their hearts paralyzed
[1:16:08] the shiny things and the and the
[1:16:10] nonsense things and the things of this
[1:16:12] world that won't matter and don't really
[1:16:14] matter oh but if I don't check my social
[1:16:16] media the world's going to
[1:16:18] end try
[1:16:21] it as the world going to go and panic
[1:16:23] and you're going to be headlin news oh
[1:16:26] bendon check his social media this day
[1:16:29] the stock market's gone down and the
[1:16:31] world's Nature's just no the world's
[1:16:34] going to continue on but I have to you
[1:16:36] know the problem is is the have to is a
[1:16:38] spirit in you feeding on oh I've got to
[1:16:41] do you have to is your life you know
[1:16:43] what's really going to happen
[1:16:45] here I've got
[1:16:47] to anyway so let a let let our faith
[1:16:51] paralyze the world now entitlement
[1:16:52] Webster tells us it's having a right to
[1:16:55] certain benefits or privileges it's a
[1:16:57] state or condition of being entitled
[1:16:59] it's a right it's a right to benefits
[1:17:01] especially um specified especially by
[1:17:04] law or by contract it's a belief that
[1:17:07] one is deserving entitled to certain
[1:17:09] privileges now that's more in the
[1:17:10] positive sense but in a negative sense
[1:17:12] an entitled person is a selfish person
[1:17:15] they think they deserve special
[1:17:17] attention and even if I just have this a
[1:17:22] a self- entitled person is a person that
[1:17:24] un a lot of people have this Condition
[1:17:27] it's a very bad condition to have amen
[1:17:29] we need treatment for for for feeling
[1:17:32] self-entitled now a self let's just go
[1:17:35] to signs of self-entitled people this is
[1:17:37] what just Google told me Google's not
[1:17:39] always wrong it's a need for special
[1:17:43] treatment why don't why doesn't the
[1:17:45] pastor spend more time with
[1:17:48] me maybe because he's
[1:17:51] busy I haven't seen him for about three
[1:17:53] months I'm sorry call me up I'm just
[1:17:56] using me as an example I should have
[1:17:58] special treatment High
[1:18:01] demands I demand selfishness lack of
[1:18:04] gratitude someone who's self-entitled
[1:18:06] they just take things for
[1:18:09] granted I know give give someone a
[1:18:12] present that they feel self-entitled
[1:18:14] well I should have got a present there's
[1:18:16] no thankfulness
[1:18:17] Associated as a victim mentality I'm the
[1:18:21] victim here do you know who the first
[1:18:23] self-entitled person was Adam that's
[1:18:25] right because when Adam fell I mean the
[1:18:27] last the last thing he did as a Son of
[1:18:29] God his position was trying to redeem
[1:18:30] his wife the first thing he did as a
[1:18:33] fallen Son of God was blame God for his
[1:18:35] problems God the woman you gave me
[1:18:39] caused me to do
[1:18:41] this sure I'm the I'm the head sure I'm
[1:18:43] you know you told me what tree not to
[1:18:46] eat and eat and all those things you
[1:18:47] know not eat but God you set me up God
[1:18:51] you set me up to fail God this is what
[1:18:53] he's telling him come come on you go
[1:18:55] read the book of Genesis the woman you
[1:18:57] gave me who caused this problem you
[1:19:02] God points all his fingers that way
[1:19:04] that's why I always do this I don't do
[1:19:05] that because three fingers point back to
[1:19:06] you he says God it's your fault I'm in
[1:19:09] this
[1:19:10] predicament and maybe God will scratch
[1:19:12] his head go No I gave you free moral
[1:19:15] choice and this is where your free moral
[1:19:17] choice took you and you're not willing
[1:19:20] to own up to the consequences of your
[1:19:22] free moral choice
[1:19:25] believing that the rules and Norms do
[1:19:27] not apply to them how many people do you
[1:19:29] hear I trust no one actually praise God
[1:19:32] oh yeah the word says this yeah but I'm
[1:19:35] special it doesn't apply to me I don't
[1:19:37] have to I don't have to live that script
[1:19:39] I don't have to do
[1:19:40] that that's self-entitled no the word
[1:19:43] applies to everyone in the same measure
[1:19:47] to the same
[1:19:48] degree expecting others to cater to
[1:19:51] their needs and
[1:19:52] desires feeling entitled to speak
[1:19:54] special treatment or privileges becoming
[1:19:56] angry or resentful when they do not get
[1:19:59] what they feel they
[1:20:01] deserve my my taking credit for others
[1:20:03] work or accomplishments blaming others
[1:20:06] for their failures or
[1:20:08] shortcomings I pray with all I know I
[1:20:11] know I'm bringing jokes in because I
[1:20:12] want to because it gets a bit heavy so
[1:20:14] just lift the atmosphere a bit and all
[1:20:15] these things right but I pray none of us
[1:20:17] live
[1:20:18] this right if you see yourself on here
[1:20:21] there's Mercy to take this nature out of
[1:20:23] you yes not looking at anyone in
[1:20:26] particular see a self- entitled person
[1:20:29] thinks they are
[1:20:31] awesome this man would Jesus would tell
[1:20:34] of the of the story of two men going to
[1:20:36] the temple to pray one was a Pharisee
[1:20:38] and he prayed thus with himself self see
[1:20:41] a self a self-entitled person is caught
[1:20:43] up with their own self I'll just put the
[1:20:46] scripture up if you don't believe me
[1:20:47] here this the Pharisees stood and prayed
[1:20:49] thus with himself God I thank thee I'm
[1:20:52] not as other men
[1:20:53] are self-entitled person uh
[1:20:59] Compares you know just like a family
[1:21:02] they talk about their wife why can't you
[1:21:04] be like sister so and
[1:21:06] so why can't you be like brother so and
[1:21:10] so no this is your family God put you
[1:21:14] together amen right we don't compare the
[1:21:17] Bible says if we compare ourselves among
[1:21:19] ourselves we become unwise so if you're
[1:21:21] comparing your paycheck your car your
[1:21:23] house your job your family your children
[1:21:26] your church your walk all those things
[1:21:28] with someone else guess what you ain't
[1:21:30] wise you're
[1:21:32] foolish so we're not we're not called to
[1:21:35] compare ourselves I'm not as other men
[1:21:37] are look how great I am extortioners
[1:21:40] unjust adulterers or even as this
[1:21:42] Publican they've always got someone to
[1:21:43] point out which is worse than them I
[1:21:46] look at all these things he says he does
[1:21:48] I fast twice in the week I give tithes
[1:21:50] of all that I possess see this is a man
[1:21:54] who does reverence God this is not a
[1:21:57] church that it does not reverence God it
[1:21:59] reverences himself he respects what he
[1:22:02] does oh I'm in the message the devil's
[1:22:05] in the message
[1:22:07] too he's here to fight we shouldn't be
[1:22:09] shocked and come on the Devil comes to
[1:22:12] church before you turn up he gets kicked
[1:22:15] out a lot and we'll continue to do that
[1:22:17] right but he causes trouble you know you
[1:22:19] say well I believe the word of God the
[1:22:21] devil believes it too James says you
[1:22:24] believe in one God you do well the
[1:22:25] Devils also believe and
[1:22:27] tremble right so it's not about what we
[1:22:31] do that matters and the publicans
[1:22:33] standing a far off could not lift up so
[1:22:35] much as his eyes unto heaven but smoted
[1:22:37] upon his breast saying God be merciful
[1:22:39] to me a sinner I tell you this man went
[1:22:41] down to his house Justified rather than
[1:22:43] the other for everyone that exalts
[1:22:45] himself shall be aase and he that
[1:22:46] humbleth himself shall be exalted am
[1:22:50] mean so one went in saying look how
[1:22:51] entitled I am because of what I
[1:22:55] do I pray I fast twice a week look at
[1:22:58] all these things God I'm glad I'm not
[1:23:00] like other people he just prayed it
[1:23:01] within himself so maybe maybe in reality
[1:23:05] he he he he maybe even walked in humbly
[1:23:08] God bless you brother God bless you
[1:23:09] Sister praise the Lord great to be here
[1:23:11] today but in his heart I'm number one
[1:23:15] I'm the best I'm the best you see but
[1:23:20] this Publican when he prayed when he
[1:23:22] said be merciful to me a sinner that
[1:23:25] that phraser he um uh scoffield says
[1:23:28] that he's saying look upon me as you
[1:23:31] look upon The Mercy Seat when the
[1:23:32] blood's applied that's what he's crying
[1:23:35] out you see so here's a man who doesn't
[1:23:38] feel entitled here's a man who feels
[1:23:40] entitled I'd say which one would be a
[1:23:42] better
[1:23:44] husband not him if you need help with
[1:23:48] that cuz he doesn't feel cuz the
[1:23:50] Publican is the one who does not feel
[1:23:53] entitled at all but he went home
[1:23:56] Justified Now isn't it amazing people
[1:23:59] get offended when they don't get special
[1:24:01] treatment they think I deserve better
[1:24:03] treatment than this our lord Jesus was
[1:24:05] invited to a feast one day he always
[1:24:08] goes where he's invited he knew the
[1:24:10] treatment he was going to receive when
[1:24:12] he walked in the door he now you think
[1:24:14] about it here is the Lord Of Glory yeah
[1:24:16] he ain't just a prophet he ain't just a
[1:24:18] holy man he ain't just good a good
[1:24:20] church member he ain't just a a Believer
[1:24:23] he's God
[1:24:24] Emmanuel God With Us is invited to a
[1:24:27] feast and there he goes in his feet
[1:24:30] aren't washed he's not made welcome he
[1:24:33] would have no doubt seen an the the the
[1:24:36] a row of guests in front of him they
[1:24:39] come in one by one their feet are washed
[1:24:41] they kiss made welcome they're anointed
[1:24:42] all these things he sees it happen to
[1:24:44] them it doesn't happen to him does he go
[1:24:47] off in a huff and say I am entitled to
[1:24:50] better treatment than this don't you
[1:24:52] know who I am don't you know how long
[1:24:54] being a Believer all these no he doesn't
[1:24:56] say nothing he sits in his allocated
[1:24:59] place oh God help us may we never be
[1:25:02] offended by how people treat us may we
[1:25:04] never be offended saying I deserve
[1:25:05] better we deserved Hell by the way but
[1:25:08] God rich and mercy found us amen so
[1:25:10] there he was amen and he he did not feel
[1:25:14] entitled right he went anyway he
[1:25:16] received the treatment he received and
[1:25:18] he did it all with grace and the love of
[1:25:19] God how about you and I well I'm in the
[1:25:22] message and I preach and I no no no no
[1:25:28] do amen we can't feel like we're inti he
[1:25:32] would say to he would say birds have
[1:25:35] nests foxes have dens but the son of man
[1:25:38] has nowhere to lay his head he could
[1:25:41] have spoken a world into
[1:25:43] existence he could have created a palace
[1:25:46] made of pure gold and lived in it yeah
[1:25:48] cuz he was he is the creator himself did
[1:25:52] he did he feel entitled to the those
[1:25:54] things
[1:25:56] no he
[1:25:58] didn't if there be any consolation in
[1:26:01] Christ I'm kind of I'm about to close if
[1:26:04] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[1:26:06] the spirit if any bowels of mercies
[1:26:08] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[1:26:10] having the same love according uh being
[1:26:13] of one Accord of one mind but let

[1:26:20] vain Glory look how great I am I I got

[1:28:19] own things but every man also on the
[1:28:21] things of others let this mind be in you
[1:28:23] which was also Al in Christ Jesus see we
[1:28:25] have to let this mind that's why that's
[1:28:27] why Paul wrote it like this way you've
[1:28:30] got to surrender that the mind of the
[1:28:31] word the mind of the spirit has
[1:28:33] preeminence remember this body ain't
[1:28:35] converted you're walking around in an
[1:28:38] unconverted
[1:28:40] animal doesn't matter how strong fit
[1:28:42] beautiful whatever you are it's
[1:28:44] unconverted this this guy this flesh

[1:31:07] interested in me living no more I need
[1:31:09] you to live amen hallelujah he took upon
[1:31:12] himself the form of a servant servants
[1:31:14] just get ordered around what to
[1:31:16] do and he was made in the likeness of
[1:31:18] men and being found in the fashion as a
[1:31:20] man he humbled himself and became
[1:31:22] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:31:23] the cross wherefore God also has highly
[1:31:26] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:31:27] is above every name that at the name of
[1:31:29] Jesus every knee should bow and of
[1:31:31] things in heaven things in Earth and
[1:31:32] things under the Earth amen and and that
[1:31:36] every tongue so I got a reason for
[1:31:38] continuing to read here that every
[1:31:40] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[1:31:41] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[1:31:44] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[1:31:47] obeyed not in my presence only but now
[1:31:50] much more in my absence work out your
[1:31:51] own salvation with fear and trembling
[1:31:54] for it for it is God which worketh in

[1:32:05] and
[1:32:05] dispute right that ye may be blameless
[1:32:09] and harmless the sons of God without
[1:32:11] rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
[1:32:13] perverse generation among whom you shine

[1:32:18] a perverse and crooked generation it's
[1:32:20] this one it's this one right now when

[1:32:25] last supper and the opening of the
[1:32:26] Olympics I say this world's gone
[1:32:29] nuts there making fun of religion why
[1:32:32] even if they're making fun of another
[1:32:33] religion I'd say that's wrong they

[1:32:37] hosting the the Olympics why are they
[1:32:40] why they mocking Christianity even if
[1:32:42] they're mocking Islam or Buddhism I'd
[1:32:44] I'd be upset about that why mock
[1:32:48] something but you see why it's a
[1:32:50] perverse and crooked generation that we
[1:32:51] live
[1:32:52] in amen that you may be blameless and
[1:32:55] harmless see blameless as it means
[1:32:57] deserving no sense you're free from
[1:32:59] fault or defect so it doesn't mean so

[1:33:03] you do things without disputing and
[1:33:05] murmuring amen that that you'll be
[1:33:08] blameless amen and then harmless means
[1:33:11] it doesn't mean that you don't cause
[1:33:12] damage because we cause
[1:33:14] damage you're a wrecking ball
[1:33:17] baby to wreck the kingdom of hell that's
[1:33:20] right amen that the that that
[1:33:22] strongholds of the enemy would be
[1:33:23] demolished in people's lives that the

[1:33:32] amen amen unmixed pure as in wines or
[1:33:35] metals of the mind without mixture of
[1:33:37] evil free from Gile innocent and simple

[1:33:41] murmurings and disputings that you may
[1:33:44] be blameless and
[1:33:45] harmless we shouldn't murmur we
[1:33:48] shouldn't be disputing this world is a

[1:36:43] out of here there's nothing to him if he
[1:36:44] was really God he'd answer me this way
[1:36:46] now he answers how he wants to answer he
[1:36:49] answers when he wants to answer and how
[1:36:50] he wants to answer it's his prog of how

[1:37:21] did not get she did not Walk Away in a
[1:37:24] half she came in humility and she was
[1:37:28] willing to take whatever he had give
[1:37:30] her
[1:37:32] amen have mercy on me oh Lord thou son
[1:37:35] of David my daughters grievously vexed
[1:37:37] with the devil but he didn't even answer

[1:37:40] disciples came Bes him saying send her
[1:37:42] away she crith after us but he answered
[1:37:45] and said now he's going to open his
[1:37:47] mouth what's he going to say I'm not
[1:37:49] sent I am not sent but unto the lost
[1:37:51] sheep of the House of Israel and now

[1:38:00] come at the wrong time did she go away
[1:38:03] no she her faith really came to its
[1:38:07] Forefront because it wasn't her
[1:38:09] Revelation that that that that he's the
[1:38:11] son of David that really moved him she
[1:38:14] worshiped him saying Lord help
[1:38:17] me Hallelujah just those three words
[1:38:21] Lord help me that really bless me this
[1:38:23] week just thinking about this see she
[1:38:26] wasn't
[1:38:26] self-entitled to me this is the attitude
[1:38:29] she was reverencing her
[1:38:31] husband spiritually I'm talking about
[1:38:33] right but she just said worship saying
[1:38:35] Lord help
[1:38:37] me amen but he answered now now look at
[1:38:40] this to me this is incredible but he
[1:38:42] answered and said it is not meat to take
[1:38:44] the children's bread and cast it to dogs
[1:38:47] you're a dog woman that's what he's
[1:38:49] saying but she said Lord truth Lord sure
[1:38:54] but yet the dogs eat the crumbs that
[1:38:56] fall from their master's table
[1:38:59] Hallelujah did she act self entitled I'm
[1:39:02] in the message I know he's coming into
[1:39:04] power in the Millennium I know he's the
[1:39:06] son of David how many people would stomp
[1:39:08] off and say there's nothing to this word
[1:39:11] but see she had a real
[1:39:14] Faith she said Lord help me what do you
[1:39:17] go even a crumb Lord I'll take it Lord
[1:39:19] I'll treasure the crumb hallelujah amen
[1:39:23] then then he answered oh woman great is
[1:39:25] thy faith be it unto thee even as thou
[1:39:27] will and her daughter was made whole
[1:39:29] from that very hour see we have many
[1:39:31] Desires in our heart but are we willing
[1:39:34] to Humble ourselves like she did to get
[1:39:38] them one way you know a desire is
[1:39:41] selfish is you don't act like
[1:39:44] this
[1:39:46] amen so what are
[1:39:48] we what are we going to what are we
[1:39:51] going to do she forfeit for she
[1:39:54] forfeited all of her rights of how he
[1:39:58] would treat her are we willing to
[1:40:00] forfeit all of our rights I talk about
[1:40:03] husband and wife in the beginning well I
[1:40:05] have a right he must treat me this way
[1:40:06] well I have a right she must treat me
[1:40:07] this way she must serve me this way she
[1:40:09] must do this are you willing to Forfeit
[1:40:11] what you perceive as your
[1:40:13] rights and stand and actually possess
[1:40:16] the word that's ordained for you to live
[1:40:19] are you willing to do it because that's
[1:40:22] how people get the things from God
[1:40:24] that's how the word actually puts on
[1:40:27] flesh amen God wants us to be Lambs you
[1:40:31] see everyone wants the blessings of God
[1:40:35] but they're not willing to really sell
[1:40:37] out and forfeit all of their rights that
[1:40:39] they perceive they have see God wants us
[1:40:42] to be Lambs a lamb is willing to submit
[1:40:44] its rights who's ever who's ever um help
[1:40:47] dock
[1:40:50] sheep I was a 12-year-old boy friend's
[1:40:52] father
[1:40:54] up the east coast of gizman help help
[1:40:55] them docking picked up the Lamb by the
[1:40:58] back legs as soon as they know that
[1:41:01] you've got a tight grip they stop
[1:41:03] kicking right who's who's experienced
[1:41:07] that right problem is we kick because we
[1:41:11] don't know if God really has a
[1:41:13] hold but as soon as you realize he's got
[1:41:15] a hold we quit kicking are you willing
[1:41:19] to be like that kind of a
[1:41:21] lamb amen
[1:41:23] that's how a lamb is
[1:41:26] anyway see well I've got rights brother
[1:41:29] bam that's true but what are you willing
[1:41:31] to forfeit your rights are you willing
[1:41:32] to give your rights that God could Lead
[1:41:35] You amen that's what's the matter with
[1:41:37] our churches today and the great
[1:41:38] majority that the gentleness of the Lamb
[1:41:40] of God we are supposed to be Lambs we
[1:41:43] have become everything else but Lambs
[1:41:45] that's the reason as soon as we get that
[1:41:46] attitude the dove of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:48] takes her flight and
[1:41:50] leaves
[1:41:52] amen he says look on look down on the
[1:41:54] altar this is he have a time of prayer
[1:41:57] altar call and see a lady turning gray a
[1:41:59] young woman with her head down solid
[1:42:01] whired woman oh God see this man
[1:42:04] kneeling different ones along here just
[1:42:05] repent tell God you're sorry tell him
[1:42:07] you don't want to do it no more by his
[1:42:10] grace you'll just let all your
[1:42:11] differences be done from today on you
[1:42:14] want to be gentle and quiet you want to
[1:42:16] be humble and go where he leads you when
[1:42:19] people say something no matter how right
[1:42:21] it looks you're going to fulfill your
[1:42:23] rights to talk about your neighbor I
[1:42:26] mean you're going to talk you're going
[1:42:27] to talk about Jesus you're going to do
[1:42:30] the thing that's right you ain't going
[1:42:31] like a murderer you ain't going out to
[1:42:33] jump on the innocent but you see that
[1:42:35] Gallant play of heroism of real
[1:42:37] Christians and you want to be like them
[1:42:39] you don't uh have to tell anybody you're
[1:42:42] a Christian if you are one they just see
[1:42:44] it and they know as you talk you're
[1:42:46] sealed inside and out are we going to
[1:42:49] Forfeit those kind of a rights well
[1:42:51] those people did this and they're doing
[1:42:52] this no no no no no are you willing to
[1:42:54] fulfill that give it over to God that
[1:42:57] actually my rights to tear down my
[1:42:59] spouse or tear down my family or tear
[1:43:01] down this person I give that because
[1:43:03] sure as a human being we have rights but
[1:43:06] those rights don't stand in the presence
[1:43:08] of God must be willing to give all those
[1:43:10] things over he would say things like you
[1:43:12] know it's it's it's my American right to
[1:43:14] drink and smoke and all these things it
[1:43:16] may be your American rights or your New
[1:43:18] Zealand rights but it's not your
[1:43:20] heavenly rights I mean those are the
[1:43:22] rights that we must must have amen see
[1:43:24] it see it it it may be our human rights
[1:43:27] to to to to be self-centered and be
[1:43:31] selfish as a human you have a right to
[1:43:33] be that way but that's not Heavenly
[1:43:35] rights right that's not that's not
[1:43:37] Christian rights we willing to fit all
[1:43:40] those things see if you're willing to
[1:43:42] fit your filthy right that you have to
[1:43:44] serve the Lord and will purpose in your
[1:43:45] heart that you'll not defile yourself
[1:43:47] with the things of the world he said
[1:43:48] brother B other Christians smoke why
[1:43:50] can't I you might have a right to smoke
[1:43:53] as an American citizen but you do not
[1:43:55] have a right to do it as a Christian
[1:43:57] because it's a stumbling block in the
[1:43:58] other person's way that's exactly right
[1:44:01] and you shouldn't do it you'll lay a
[1:44:03] stumbling
[1:44:04] block are you willing to fulfill all
[1:44:06] those things who who doesn't want to be
[1:44:08] a stumbling block
[1:44:10] here well I can live my life however I
[1:44:12] want to live my life but your life has
[1:44:14] an influence on someone else right just
[1:44:17] like I read the story of the woman who
[1:44:18] had the drunk husband her life was
[1:44:20] influence she wasn't living her life for
[1:44:21] herself she was living life for a far
[1:44:23] greater purpose that her husband would
[1:44:25] be saved right and that should be the
[1:44:28] same thing with you and I that we don't
[1:44:29] want to lay a stumbling block in front
[1:44:32] of someone and in self- entitled message
[1:44:35] believer is a very big stumbling
[1:44:37] block right we don't want to live that
[1:44:40] kind of a way amen but we want to be
[1:44:43] like the Lambs of God we surrender all
[1:44:45] of our rights to him and let him live
[1:44:48] that is the only way friends the word
[1:44:50] will ever put on flesh he say but I
[1:44:53] dress the part I speak the part I play
[1:44:55] the part what about in here what about
[1:44:58] what's going on in here oh but me and my
[1:45:01] things and my that no no what's going on
[1:45:03] in here forfit all those things to God
[1:45:06] I'm now now I'm closing okay give all
[1:45:09] that to the Lorden he say I deserve to
[1:45:12] be treated better the Lord
[1:45:14] Jesus the Lord Jesus let's just look at
[1:45:17] this the Lord Jesus deserved far better
[1:45:20] treatment than this he deserved far
[1:45:22] better treatment than being crucified
[1:45:24] and being rejected and dying with a
[1:45:25] broken heart he deserved far better
[1:45:28] treatment than being spat upon his bed
[1:45:29] ripped out and M more than any other man
[1:45:31] the king of glory but did he feel
[1:45:34] entitled no so I'm come here to fulfill
