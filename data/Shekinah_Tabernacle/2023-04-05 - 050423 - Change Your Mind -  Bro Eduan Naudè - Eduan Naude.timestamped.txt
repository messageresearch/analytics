[21:28] leading up to that that great Easter
[21:31] Time Lord where it was a good Friday
[21:36] Lord and as we as we read through your
[21:40] word we see that it was maybe not a good
[21:43] Friday for your disciples and what they
[21:47] saw what they had to endure what you had
[21:50] to endure but it was a good Friday Lord
[21:53] because before the foundations of the
[21:55] world
[21:56] you've ordained this to go down into
[21:59] hell and grab those keys
[22:01] Lord and just release us from anything
[22:05] on this side of the veil that will try
[22:08] and keep us away from you
[22:10] you are all in all you are our full stop

[29:17] may the Lord add the blessing to his
[29:19] word you may have your seats so it's
[29:22] such a wonderful atmosphere now
[29:24] I've got a really simple thought tonight
[29:29] of nothing
[29:31] nothing new
[29:33] um I'll just grab my notes here so
[29:38] I'll start off with that one
[29:41] yes
[29:43] Colossians 2 as he therefore receives
[29:46] Christ Jesus the Lord so walk you with
[29:49] him rooted in Baltimore built up in him
[29:52] and established in the faith as ye have
[29:55] been taught abounding therein with
[29:58] Thanksgiving
[30:00] it is such a marvelous time to
[30:03] to be alive
[30:05] um if we can grasp
[30:07] um in our age where we are so far down
[30:11] the track
[30:12] and if you can still keep going if you
[30:15] can still be walking
[30:18] and still
[30:20] have and we'll get to it now oh man I
[30:23] just want to jump for it
[30:25] okay firstly
[30:27] I'm going to welcome Heinz van amarva
[30:29] now this is incredible
[30:33] I think the Lord just blessed me I
[30:35] walked in here and saw this familiar
[30:37] face I don't think he remembers me
[30:39] um we've made I think you say 2008 so
[30:43] let's say 2008 2010 so this was before I
[30:48] was here and um we meet in one of the
[30:52] churches and the promise Keepers events
[30:55] and all that and I remember
[30:57] his his uh South African rugby Jersey is
[31:01] sharks Jersey so immediately we
[31:03] connected because I'm a bull and he's a
[31:05] shark so we didn't we had something to
[31:08] talk about and we've got three state
[31:10] there in the back praise the Lord that
[31:12] God's just released us from that day oh
[31:15] my if I can throw up photos here of of
[31:19] those bull horns and painted all them
[31:21] blue and just shouting out then the next
[31:23] day ironically at church you don't have
[31:26] a voice because you just screamed it all
[31:28] away for what I don't know for
[31:30] entertainment a few you know 30
[31:33] boys you know they say they 28 but I
[31:36] think they're just boys kicking the ball
[31:38] around so anyway this is not in my notes
[31:40] I'm so sorry
[31:42] but let's let's move on well I say it's
[31:45] not on my notes the Lord's got it in
[31:47] control when when I when I saw Heinz
[31:50] this this evening and I thought quickly
[31:52] back I had this glance of my life and go
[31:54] oh I was not the man that I used to be
[31:58] I'm not the man that I ought to be so
[32:00] but as long as I'm walking and that's
[32:02] what I'm saying if you go don't okay
[32:05] kids kids let's move on kids
[32:08] you tell me what do you see
[32:12] a yellow dot a guy get get more creative
[32:16] son oh I like that I like that because
[32:18] the color is telling you okay all right
[32:20] another one another guess
[32:23] right
[32:24] a star a moon I like that okay I'm gonna
[32:28] give you the next slide
[32:31] or what do you see now
[32:33] oh a comma
[32:35] so that might be a
[32:38] full stop a period thank you to the 12
[32:41] year old they in the back
[32:43] it's a full stop and that's a comma and
[32:46] do you see how
[32:49] how small the difference is
[32:51] okay so I want to to focus on that and
[32:54] say please Lord in my life
[32:59] you are the only full stop I cannot put
[33:02] a full stop on my life I cannot put the
[33:05] full stop on my walk on my on my
[33:07] business on my work on my lovely family
[33:10] on the bonds of Love of my fellowship
[33:13] here around the word please Lord do not
[33:15] put a full stop
[33:17] give me some relation give me something
[33:20] to to press on not to get comfortable
[33:23] I want to be that comma I want to be
[33:26] that comma
[33:28] here's my bold statement
[33:30] God cannot change and exactly because of
[33:33] that reason you will always change
[33:36] if you are hungry and if you are sincere
[33:40] to the Lord God Almighty and you look
[33:43] back and you see I've got one constant
[33:45] in my life one concert that's Jehovah
[33:50] then
[33:51] you will always have a comma you will
[33:55] always have the benefit benefit of the
[33:57] debt you will always have the back of
[33:58] your brother you are always just try and
[34:01] be the the better version of yourself
[34:04] from yesterday right
[34:09] now this I say Brethren that Flesh and
[34:11] Blood Jimmy did you read this on Sunday
[34:14] I think
[34:15] uh cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[34:17] neither do corruption inherit
[34:20] incorruption
[34:22] my previous statement now
[34:25] behold I show you a mystery you shall
[34:27] not all sleep but you shall all be
[34:28] changed who can tell me what's then
[34:31] verse 52.
[34:33] all be changed
[34:35] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm
[34:39] telling you don't wait for that day
[34:41] to be changed right we start now may
[34:45] that twinkling of November I look
[34:47] natural to this world you are so so
[34:50] contrary to this world you are so
[34:52] walking uh absolutely different step to
[34:56] what this this world can offer you that
[34:59] it'll just be a twinkling of an eye and
[35:02] we disappear
[35:04] now I want to sort of I was thinking
[35:06] about
[35:07] um what what this let's go back to the
[35:10] comma
[35:12] the comma indicates a pause right it
[35:15] indicates Parts it splits up parts of a
[35:18] sentence of a structure it gives you a
[35:21] place to sort of catch your breath rest
[35:23] and then press on you would say I think
[35:26] brother Isaac would say a
[35:29] joke the punchline is that comma is so
[35:33] important if you have that little pause
[35:35] at the right place you can deliver that
[35:38] um that joke
[35:39] uh Dave you did it so well at the at the
[35:42] wedding eh yeah we're waiting for that
[35:44] recording
[35:46] it indicates changes coming perhaps a
[35:49] continuation of something right so there
[35:52] might be a slight Direction change but
[35:54] you still still going in the same
[35:57] same angle the same direction right the
[36:00] comma here for me indicates a change a
[36:03] change in your circumstances and your
[36:05] walk and the expectation of something
[36:07] more to come let me just step back
[36:09] quickly everything that brother anyone
[36:11] here says to you is always from a from a
[36:14] spiritual
[36:15] connection a spiritual connotation like
[36:18] brother Marcus how have your spiritual
[36:19] jackets on right I I see something in
[36:23] the natural I see something physical and
[36:25] I always go and hunt for what is the
[36:27] spiritual where's the original from this
[36:29] one where's where did it all start so
[36:32] please have that in your mind while I'm
[36:34] going through all this
[36:37] so a change in circumstances in your
[36:39] walk an expectation of something more to
[36:42] come more to be revealed as in we are
[36:46] not done yet
[36:47] okay and as we say usually in our in our
[36:51] um
[36:52] sort of in the corporate world we've
[36:55] said it a lot a lot of times here
[36:58] um
[36:58] the only constant in life as we commonly
[37:01] say is change so the only thing that you
[37:04] can absolutely expect in your life is
[37:07] change okay I'm going to say this word
[37:09] change quite a bit right so let's go to
[37:13] that next scripture that we'll have it
[37:15] here yes I do
[37:23] and be not conformed to this world but
[37:26] be transformed by the renewing of your
[37:28] mind that you may prove what is good and
[37:32] acceptable look at those commas and
[37:34] perfect will of God right it's a
[37:38] continuation it's more and more and it's
[37:40] better and better as you read this
[37:42] sentence and this is where I sort of
[37:44] want to change pardon the pun
[37:47] the word change here relates quite
[37:51] closely to the word renew okay and if
[37:54] you look through the scripts as well a
[37:56] renewal of the mind so it means there's
[37:58] a change that happening a bitumen
[38:00] something that's that's to come right so
[38:04] I went sort of on a hunt tonight and I
[38:06] looked at what is the what is the renew
[38:10] means
[38:10] to resume an activity after an
[38:13] interruption now praise be to God what
[38:16] an interruption have you had in your
[38:18] life Brother Andy when you were on the
[38:21] on the bad side of the prison bars what
[38:23] an interruption did you have in your
[38:25] life and what happened then there was a
[38:27] comma there was a change there was a
[38:30] renewal yeah and did it ever stop did it
[38:33] ever stop if I look at if I look brother
[38:36] Isaac if like Dave 10 years ago where he
[38:39] was just your testimony on set on Sunday
[38:41] and where is he now right that shows me
[38:45] as well he hasn't put a period he hasn't
[38:47] put a full stop on his life now what is
[38:50] what is his the Lord can can work with
[38:52] you in such an incredible way when you
[38:55] go to him and say Lord I know nothing
[38:58] uh this is you've been awesome to me
[39:01] you've revealed this to me where I am at
[39:04] this point of my life but
[39:07] it's a comma
[39:09] please add more to your word in my life
[39:13] the Collins Dictionary says
[39:16] um to bring back to original condition
[39:18] of freshness and vigor I love that I
[39:23] love that the original condition so
[39:25] interesting that a renewal or a change
[39:28] can bring you back to the original
[39:30] condition and this is what we want bride
[39:33] this is what we want we want the
[39:35] original condition but it's going to be
[39:37] fresh because our bodies are going to be
[39:40] changed amen
[39:43] now yeah here we go
[39:46] gonna jump straight into it
[39:48] and I hope you can follow
[39:52] speaking here of legion he crossed the
[39:56] Sea and the disciples had been very
[39:57] weary and he still the water or the sea
[40:01] for them crossed all the way over in
[40:03] gadara where there was a maniac so One
[40:06] Singular person right taking the chance
[40:08] of crossing the stormy sea when the
[40:11] Devils of the sea swore they'd drowned
[40:13] him that night but he went over there
[40:15] for the Cry of one person one poor
[40:18] Maniac now this is very important to me
[40:20] and I I actually prayed I I I haven't
[40:23] read this quote before well probably
[40:25] I've I've heard it but not in this
[40:27] context and how it had lined in my mind
[40:30] I said Lord wasn't wasn't Legion just a
[40:33] good man was he just not you know he had
[40:36] he was a husband to to kids uh to a to a
[40:39] wife and and a dad to kids you know
[40:42] but I think what happened is he had a
[40:44] full stop in his life I think he maybe
[40:47] got a bit comfortable where he was in
[40:49] his circumstances say I'm going to sit a
[40:50] bit I'm going to stop a bit I think I've
[40:52] I've preached the bet the battle enough
[40:54] a bit and he stopped and what happens
[40:57] here perhaps a good man one day or one
[40:59] time walked upright before God but
[41:01] probably got in the wrong crowd might be
[41:04] starting drinking or something lost his
[41:05] mind and he lived out in the tombs where
[41:08] the demons lived now listen
[41:10] we don't have to even go that far down
[41:12] the path of of drinking and smoking and
[41:15] gambling and an addiction I'm saying
[41:19] I'm seeing churches and it's not far
[41:23] from from from our walk and and and what
[41:25] we believe where where they are putting
[41:28] a full stop and I'm and and I'm praying
[41:31] for for
[41:32] guidance in our lives and are praying
[41:34] for for grace and mercy that they keep
[41:37] that comma keep pushing on where they
[41:40] want to say we've received this we we
[41:43] don't have to have anything more
[41:46] um it's been given to us the last
[41:48] prophet of this age and we'll just
[41:50] follow what what he sees this just just
[41:53] quote him just this nothing more just
[41:56] just go back to that message just go
[41:58] back to that quote just go okay
[42:01] the Lord is not for for us said he's
[42:05] moving the light is moving the light is
[42:08] not stopping for for no reason Okay so
[42:13] we've got incredible responsibility now
[42:16] that our prophet of our age is off the
[42:19] scene
[42:20] to be that hands and feet
[42:22] to come to a quote like this and explain
[42:26] and open up and break the bread and what
[42:29] is our fresh Manna for today for this
[42:31] Lord because he was maybe saying it in
[42:34] 1954.
[42:36] what is maybe for our day
[42:38] so the the maybe the the the people
[42:41] there
[42:42] lifted for our day they had the comma so
[42:45] what are we doing about that right
[42:49] now here's the interesting thing
[42:52] that I think from I'll just go back to
[42:55] our renewal renewing of the Mind
[42:59] now all of a sudden I'm quoting you
[43:01] Legion
[43:04] so oh I actually want to read that very
[43:07] last little bit there he crossed the
[43:10] Seas
[43:12] leave the Heavens to answer that prayer
[43:14] it's the same Jesus yesterday today and
[43:17] forever that means that's that's the
[43:20] full stop
[43:21] hunting us that's the full stop hearing
[43:24] our cries that's that's the one the
[43:26] constant that's that's that's hearing
[43:29] hearing us right so
[43:33] jumping now to the complete opposite
[43:36] of renew
[43:40] and that's religion
[43:43] religion
[43:45] is a full stop
[43:47] religion we take the Catholics we take
[43:50] when when Martin Luther came on the
[43:52] scene we look at the people that adopted
[43:54] that and the light moved on and the
[43:57] religion stayed
[43:59] Okay so we've received what we've
[44:00] received we're comfortable we're sitting
[44:02] down we're building our houses now what
[44:05] happens now
[44:07] this house well these These Walls go up
[44:10] usually when you stop for a little bit
[44:13] too long
[44:14] as things coming and growing and there's
[44:18] a war coming up now
[44:20] from the inside of that you might feel
[44:23] safe
[44:24] from there you might say well none of
[44:26] these um new extreme things like
[44:30] um or example in my life when I came
[44:33] into this message and I received my
[44:35] first message and I listened to this
[44:37] whole life story of William Branham I go
[44:41] there's a few things I need to shelf
[44:43] here I can't work through that right now
[44:45] now if I did not have that com if I did
[44:49] not have a heart with the change now God
[44:52] is Sovereign he gives us that okay so
[44:55] but through the Lord's Grace he said
[44:58] listen I'm cutting from this cloth and
[45:00] you are on the right side of this cloth
[45:02] he's Sovereign and I had that comma Now
[45:05] in my will my free model agent I could
[45:08] say I was comfortable before I received
[45:11] this I was it but I wasn't comfortable I
[45:13] just told Heinz I was church hopping
[45:16] everywhere I wasn't comfortable I didn't
[45:18] find rest I didn't find the peace
[45:20] where's the love you know it was all
[45:23] around me but it was it that the truth
[45:25] it was good but was a truth you know so
[45:30] anyway coming back to religion it gets
[45:33] comfortable and the wars go up right so
[45:35] what happens if the wars go up and the
[45:38] sun comes up if the if it's a big nice
[45:40] fortified wall and you sitting on the
[45:42] inside of the wall the sun is coming up
[45:44] are you feeling it on your face are you
[45:48] are you consuming what is what is being
[45:51] given to you
[45:52] it's now just going over your top over
[45:54] your head okay the walls are sort of
[45:57] protecting you but it's keeping the sun
[45:59] that's moving away from you so that you
[46:02] cannot get that vitamin D now in this
[46:04] case it's probably vitamin Alpha and
[46:07] Omega you know so and that's and that's
[46:12] just just a thought within my
[46:15] in my study do not let's not repeat the
[46:20] life of legion let's not and and I'm
[46:23] coloring it in I'm using my imagination
[46:25] he could have been a very good guy it
[46:28] could have been a husband could have had
[46:30] kids he had maybe a decent job but
[46:32] somewhere he stopped along the line
[46:34] somewhere he said
[46:35] no change anymore no no seeking anymore
[46:39] no
[46:40] scrolling the scriptures to find fresh
[46:43] Manna for the day
[46:45] now
[46:48] I think I've read that no I haven't here
[46:51] we go
[46:53] not long after that
[46:55] no no that's my very very last
[46:57] very last thought that I want to give
[47:00] you
[47:03] yes is this
[47:05] okay
[47:07] so before we go into that I'll just keep
[47:08] it on that religion so here's my sort of
[47:11] my leading up to it and I just want to
[47:13] mention a few
[47:15] uh things and a few questions and you
[47:18] can answer it in your in yourself
[47:22] okay
[47:24] so who did our lamb come for
[47:27] when he stooped down to earth
[47:30] he came to those outside a religion
[47:33] okay he came to the Fishermans and the
[47:35] tax collectors that were not good enough
[47:38] Scholars for the Pharisees for those
[47:41] outside the synagogues that were safe
[47:44] inside their fortresses of religion they
[47:47] missed them they missed the Messiah
[47:51] took going back to Renewal going back to
[47:53] change Abraham changed to Abraham but it
[47:57] did not stop there there was a comma and
[48:00] him and Sarah they changed more even
[48:03] physically right Saul changed to Paul
[48:05] but I I imagine when he changed from
[48:08] Saul to Paul under Damascus Road he was
[48:11] not expecting he's going to sit and
[48:13] worship and sing along in a prison cell
[48:15] down the line right
[48:18] and probably the most most fortified
[48:21] prison I guess at that point
[48:23] so he had to have that comma he had to
[48:26] have if this is the Lord God Almighty
[48:28] speaking to me on this Damascus Road
[48:30] there must be more then he can't
[48:32] revealed to me all he can't give us all
[48:36] everything at the same time we will not
[48:39] be able to handle it okay our our
[48:40] physical our flesh cannot be handled now
[48:43] okay that's Old Testament that's New
[48:46] Testament
[48:47] who has seen a change in Benjamin and
[48:50] Margaret since they've moved down to to
[48:53] Willington right and I can tell you now
[48:57] you can put a comma there because they
[48:59] will come back from this honeymoon and
[49:01] you will see them refreshed and renewed
[49:03] and changed absolutely for the good how
[49:05] they've would have grown into together
[49:08] and to themselves intertwined but how
[49:11] they are chasing after the goodness of
[49:14] God right for their lives
[49:16] now that brings me then to sort of the
[49:20] the second to last comment I want to
[49:22] make is why is testimony so powerful why
[49:25] is someone's testimony so powerful and
[49:26] why do I I pull so much from a testimony
[49:30] is because I can hear the commas I can
[49:32] hear the change I can hear the the Lord
[49:34] wasn't done with you okay Lord what's
[49:37] next you know where he goes out of the
[49:39] depths and get us right there was a
[49:41] comma and he could work with that if
[49:44] there's a full stop he's a gentleman he
[49:45] will step back right and that's why
[49:48] testimonies are so powerful the only
[49:51] thing that that that can't change from
[49:53] the testimony is the testimony it's is
[49:56] the holistic is the whole okay within
[49:59] that there's so many stuff that changes
[50:01] and and makes that this this this
[50:04] shiny Diamond you know or piece of
[50:07] polished gold that you can't if you
[50:11] change anything you take away the
[50:13] testimony right
[50:15] and then prayer
[50:17] so surely and I've had this in the
[50:19] Sunday School surely we don't pray the
[50:21] same every time look at our prayer
[50:23] requests that come forth tonight it's
[50:25] never the same it constantly changed and
[50:28] we go Lord
[50:30] um you know last night we were sitting
[50:32] and praying as a family and um our
[50:35] neighbors you know all of a sudden I'm
[50:36] thinking and our light needs to just
[50:39] consume our neighbors need to push into
[50:42] their lives without us speaking a word
[50:44] seeing the difference seeing our kids
[50:46] seeing Joy feeling it you know tangible
[50:49] that yeah and that comes down to that
[50:52] comes down to pray so I want to plead to
[50:55] you tonight pray
[50:57] for change pray in your life that we
[51:00] just continue on down this road
[51:04] a few few things that I noted down here
[51:07] is even even brother Branham he said
[51:09] from the pulpit he was pleading with the
[51:11] people that he is nothing right he is
[51:15] not
[51:17] not the one that they wanted to put the
[51:19] period on right
[51:21] but pointed them to Jesus Christ the
[51:23] same yesterday and today forever he's
[51:25] trying to say that he is still changing
[51:27] the prophet himself still renewing to
[51:31] that glorious glorified body that is
[51:33] awaiting him
[51:34] and at one stage he was even even
[51:36] skeptic about people speaking in tongues
[51:39] you know and he said it over the pulpit
[51:41] but what happened he changed now all of
[51:44] a sudden he said Lord I do not
[51:45] understand and he comes and this this
[51:48] has been revealed to him
[51:50] the last one then and many many many
[51:53] examples I can take out of the
[51:55] Scriptures it is actually incredible to
[51:58] sit there and there's so so many things
[52:00] I wanted to share tonight when I started
[52:02] open and if you take a a vague subject
[52:05] something like change you know where do
[52:07] you start where do you end you know
[52:09] um our whole life is is on this Lord
[52:13] change me Lord you know you cannot you
[52:16] cannot put a period in this flesh you
[52:19] cannot put and we read it in the in the
[52:22] corruptable right keep pressing on
[52:25] last slide talking about Blind by the
[52:29] Mayas
[52:30] not long after that he was shivering in
[52:32] the cold one day they heard a voice God
[52:35] had provided the lamb for blind brother
[52:37] mice
[52:39] um
[52:39] eyes he come along the street and he
[52:42] said what's all that noise so obviously
[52:44] he could hear there was a noise coming
[52:46] so usually there's noise where he is
[52:48] praise the lord we sing We Praise we
[52:51] shout when he comes in and they change
[52:52] the atmosphere isn't it
[52:54] what's all that noise he said one uh
[52:57] Jesus of Nazareth passed by he threw
[53:00] down his coat so he was shivering right
[53:02] so not looking where it is uh where it
[53:05] went he didn't care
[53:07] God had provided a lamb he got right to
[53:10] the lamb he said oh Jesus thou son of
[53:12] David have mercy have mercy the rich
[53:15] people and those who stood around get
[53:17] close to the prophet the king he said Oh
[53:20] Be Still he can't hear you I cried that
[53:24] much more so please change that in your
[53:26] in your In Your Vessel cry more then if
[53:29] you think he's not hearing you cry more
[53:33] um the days of Miracles past there's no
[53:35] such thing as of today he crowd louder
[53:38] thou son of David have mercy on me have
[53:40] mercy on me and God provided the lamb he
[53:44] said you you showed me your your your
[53:48] pause you showed that you cannot stop
[53:52] um looking for for truth and for the yes
[53:56] and amen I will come and I will sup with
[53:58] you
[53:59] he provided the lamb and what I wanted
[54:03] to say is
[54:06] maybe the maybe the musicians can come
[54:09] maybe the musicians can come I want to
[54:11] and to say that um there's there's a few
[54:14] schools that say that the Last Supper
[54:17] could have happened on a Wednesday
[54:19] and a Thursday I'm not here to make
[54:22] doctrines I was just reading up as I was
[54:24] researching a few things and I thought
[54:26] well

[54:31] should not wait for that Good Friday all
[54:33] right Lord and how how how rich the last
[54:38] supper was and what it meant when he
[54:41] broke the bread let's take it in tonight

[54:46] as an expectation of what is to come
