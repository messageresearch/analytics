[40:10] happen over
[40:11] whenever i'm back in in here doing it if
[40:13] the lord wills
[40:15] so we'll just see how this goes amen so
[40:18] let's um i just ask for your undivided
[40:20] attention and for you to be focused
[40:22] because there's it's basically going to
[40:24] be a lot of reading but there's lots of
[40:26] pictures as well so we can have a bit of
[40:28] a visual as well as a audible amen who's
[40:32] excited to hear from the lord tonight
[40:34] amen hallelujah um oh yeah i'll do this
[40:38] so we're going to speak on the subject
[40:40] called the two trees and part one is
[40:42] called the overview of both trees from
[40:44] eternity to time
[40:47] hallelujah so let's read from luke
[40:49] chapter 6 verses 43 to 45 and it says
[40:53] here
[40:54] say amen if you're there
[40:56] amen hallelujah
[40:59] we're just family amen hallelujah
[41:02] hallelujah there's no need to be nervous
[41:04] hallelujah
[41:07] for a good tree bringeth forth
[41:11] not
[41:12] oh sorry
[41:13] sorry for a good tree bringeth not forth
[41:16] corrupt fruit
[41:18] neither does a corrupt tree
[41:20] bring forth good fruit
[41:22] for every tree is known by his fruit
[41:27] may the lord bless his word you may be
[41:28] seated
[41:30] hallelujah
[41:34] right
[41:37] hallelujah
[41:43] so we're speaking of the two trees and
[41:45] the two trees obviously
[41:46] everyone knows what the two trees are
[41:48] the tree of life and the tree of
[41:50] knowledge of good and evil
[41:51] amen and everything comes back to those
[41:54] two trees
[41:55] everything the every inspiration
[41:58] anything you've ever thought anything
[42:00] you've ever done
[42:01] anything you've ever believed or ever
[42:04] partaken of
[42:05] is rooted in either these two trees
[42:08] and you know the trees are symbolic
[42:12] poetic they're they're they're not
[42:14] literal trees but the idea of the tree
[42:18] is used because of its nature and it's
[42:21] the way it works and it's a metaphor who
[42:24] knows what a metaphor is
[42:26] hey man when do you start learning that
[42:28] like standard four
[42:30] form one
[42:32] everyone's like what's that
[42:34] there's only a few of us in here now
[42:36] year seven year eight it's probably when
[42:38] you start learning about that eh hey man
[42:40] so anyway
[42:44] my why is a tree used to depict
[42:46] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[42:49] and the tree of life
[42:50] and here the reason is is because of the
[42:53] parts of the tree you've got
[42:55] now you've got it you've got this
[42:57] organism that's rooted in the ground
[43:00] and you've got now um
[43:03] the process of this tree is that there
[43:06] is life in the tree
[43:08] right so where where that's rooted in is
[43:12] the inspiration to that tree
[43:14] and so the the
[43:16] what's the the the life is in the tree
[43:19] and it comes out and it comes out into
[43:21] the fruit right and the tree is known by
[43:23] its fruit so
[43:25] the tree of life the fruit of the tree
[43:27] of life would be
[43:29] love joy peace long suffering and these
[43:32] are the fruits of the spirit of god so
[43:35] what's the sap in that tree
[43:38] the holy ghost exactly
[43:40] the holy ghost is the sap in the tree of
[43:42] life so what's the sap in the tree of
[43:44] knowledge of good and evil it's the
[43:46] unholy ghost
[43:48] it's the unholy ghost it's unholy
[43:49] inspiration it's the inspiration of
[43:52] satan
[43:53] it's it's a corruption of truth
[43:56] so you have perfect truth perfect
[43:59] realization and then you have a
[44:00] corruption of that whether it's corrupt
[44:02] by one word or everything it's still a
[44:05] corruption and it's the roots of that so
[44:08] what you have here now as jesus said a
[44:10] tree is known by its fruit is
[44:13] this tree if this was the tree of life
[44:15] there would be love joy peace long
[44:17] suffering and the fruit of christ that
[44:21] would be the sweet stuff on the outside
[44:23] of the fruit there's love
[44:24] joy peace
[44:26] long suffering but inside there is a
[44:29] seed
[44:30] and that seed has got life inside it
[44:33] and that seed will produce another
[44:35] christian
[44:36] if it's you are you on the tree of life
[44:39] right now
[44:41] remember today is going to be an
[44:42] overview so i'm not going to go too deep
[44:44] into anything but then the next service
[44:46] will be about the fruit of the tree of
[44:48] life and then it's going to be about the
[44:50] fruit of the tree of knowledge after the
[44:51] service after that and then that's about
[44:53] it amen oh there is another one which
[44:56] will go into the destruction of the tree
[44:59] of knowledge of good and evil
[45:01] and you'll see man it's such a subject
[45:04] that's such a subject hallelujah um amen
[45:08] so we have here now if this was the tree
[45:12] of life it would have the seed in there
[45:13] and
[45:14] you use jesus says now
[45:17] but first before i go to the next slide
[45:19] i want you to see
[45:21] that
[45:22] if this was the tree of knowledge these
[45:24] would be different fruit
[45:26] they wouldn't be the fruit of the spirit
[45:28] and the fruit of and they wouldn't have
[45:30] the seed in them they will have a seed
[45:32] but it won't have any life in it you
[45:34] know that does anyone know that if you
[45:36] hybridize something you take god's
[45:38] creation god's creation you mix it up
[45:40] the life is gone
[45:42] it doesn't have the same life it's not
[45:44] original anymore that's why it's called
[45:46] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[45:48] because satan and we'll get into this
[45:50] but satan had a plan and his plan was he
[45:53] thought was better than the plan of
[45:54] god's
[45:56] god has this idea of a perfect
[45:57] civilization of love joy and an economy
[46:00] that works and the spoken word and
[46:02] creation and supernatural and satan
[46:05] thought no no that's not good enough and
[46:07] satan thought he had a better idea okay
[46:09] so satan in doing that because you can
[46:12] imagine in heaven it's perfect and
[46:14] there's truth and there's the
[46:15] righteousness of god the economy of god
[46:18] the plan of god to have a family and to
[46:21] do all these things which he would have
[46:22] been revealing and that lucifer was like
[46:25] nah nah nah come and follow me a good
[46:27] portion of the angels he took them and
[46:29] he rose himself above them and he said
[46:32] and he went up to the kingdom of the
[46:33] north it said and he said this is my
[46:35] plan and he begin to lay out another
[46:37] plan
[46:38] and lo and behold you're in the middle
[46:41] of it
[46:42] you are in the middle of his plan out
[46:44] there but thankfully god has grace to
[46:48] say i'm not going to allow you to be of
[46:49] that
[46:51] i'm going to rescue you out of that
[46:53] civilization out of that plan i'm going
[46:54] to take you and put you in back on the
[46:56] tree of life
[46:58] it's a different economy it's a
[46:59] different sap
[47:00] it's it's not the sap of of satan or
[47:03] some corruption it's the sap of the holy
[47:05] ghost and when you're abiding on that
[47:08] vine then you become a branch right we
[47:10] all know this this is very elementary
[47:12] stuff but i think it's quite cool to um
[47:14] just go over it again amen so
[47:18] satan rose up above that and he decided
[47:20] to have a civilization and this is the
[47:22] civilization you see out there monetary
[47:24] systems all of the education system
[47:27] learning
[47:28] effort law
[47:30] rules all of that
[47:32] this whole control and and like this
[47:35] whole effort of man and to preserve the
[47:37] ideas of man and to lift up men above
[47:41] men
[47:43] there's a whole system
[47:45] of control that's a lack of the holy
[47:47] ghost and that's the reason why it
[47:49] doesn't work that's the reason why no
[47:51] matter what you do at the tree of
[47:52] knowledge you can give all your faith to
[47:54] it
[47:54] and you can believe in it and you can
[47:56] become a phd scientist and push
[47:58] evolution and push these things and
[48:01] and it will take you nowhere other than
[48:04] having maybe a better income and a bit
[48:06] of prestige in the world and it will
[48:08] just it won't actually get you anywhere
[48:10] and actually the prophet says that you
[48:12] get only to a certain point and then you
[48:13] fall backwards you know that yeah
[48:16] he says it quite a few times it's not
[48:17] just like a fig like he said it once he
[48:19] said it quite a few times i don't quite
[48:20] understand exactly what he means by fall
[48:22] backwards but
[48:24] it is fairly self-explanatory that you
[48:26] can't go any further and when you get to
[48:28] the top
[48:29] it's like you spring back and you don't
[48:31] know what to do and a lot of scientists
[48:32] they end up either becoming agnostic or
[48:35] they you know they just
[48:37] whatever they do they don't go any
[48:39] further but the tree of life now the
[48:42] prophet says when you get to the end of
[48:43] the tree of knowledge now jump over onto
[48:45] the tree of life and you'll just it's he
[48:47] says he's you've got untapped potential
[48:51] untapped
[48:52] oh my there's power
[48:55] love
[48:56] untapped you know the joy of the lord is
[48:59] untapped
[49:00] hallelujah there's so much currents and
[49:02] rivers of god
[49:04] hallelujah
[49:06] brother brown says this he says like i
[49:08] was preaching the other night on the
[49:10] blood offering blood sacrifice babylon
[49:12] is spoke of in genesis the first of the
[49:14] bible babylon spoke of in the middle of
[49:15] the bible babylon spoke of in the last
[49:17] of the bible it starts in genesis comes
[49:20] over to revelations everything begins
[49:22] them two spirits so he's lying
[49:25] everything back to these two spirits and
[49:27] all that stuff that you see in the
[49:28] civilizations and everything that comes
[49:30] under the babylonian
[49:33] umbrella is all
[49:35] everything that's all of that just comes
[49:37] back to the spirit of the devil and then
[49:38] there's god's spirit
[49:41] so we're going to start with the tree of
[49:43] life and jesus says
[49:44] i am the true vine and my father is the
[49:47] husbandman
[49:48] every branch in me that beareth not
[49:50] fruit he taketh away and every brunch
[49:52] that beareth fruit he purges it that it
[49:55] may bring forth more fruit
[49:57] now you are clean through the word which
[49:58] i have spoken unto you abide in me and
[50:01] iron you as the branch
[50:04] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[50:07] abide in the vine
[50:08] no more can you except you abide in me
[50:12] i am the vine ye are the branches it's
[50:15] very clear who's the tree of life right
[50:17] but i'm going to go through quite a few
[50:18] different scriptures to show you exactly
[50:21] how he portrays himself poetically and
[50:24] directly as the tree of life and he's
[50:26] saying that you're the branches and he
[50:28] says if my abide in me and i and you
[50:31] what is that this holy spirit that has
[50:33] been made away for us to come and live
[50:34] in us to abide in you you will become
[50:36] fruitful but you need to believe that he
[50:39] is that vine and you need to believe his
[50:41] promises now this isn't rocket science
[50:44] this isn't some complicated thing you
[50:46] just need to have no fear and believe
[50:48] the promises of god and nothing is
[50:50] impossible
[50:52] nothing is impossible you look down the
[50:54] barrel of so many impossible situations
[50:56] but none of them are actually impossible
[50:58] the problem is is fear
[51:01] fear of the unknown fear that the devil
[51:04] because you know they weren't going to
[51:05] just give it to you like he's not going
[51:06] to stop attacking you he's not going to
[51:08] just let you have something without
[51:10] giving the resistance so he's going to
[51:12] put unbelief on you he's going to try
[51:14] and make you disbelieve things he's
[51:16] going to work against the promises of
[51:18] god but if you just believe in the
[51:20] simplicity of it like a child to their
[51:23] father and say i believe it and i'm
[51:25] going to walk in that and you begin to
[51:27] walk in that and believe the promises of
[51:28] god and you believe that he's divine in
[51:31] that you because it's only faith in him
[51:34] that connects you to the tree of life
[51:37] there's no other way to do it
[51:39] faith in him as the tree of life because
[51:42] adam wasn't allowed anymore but now you
[51:44] are
[51:45] you're allowed access back to the tree
[51:46] of life
[51:48] and the tree of life has come in such a
[51:49] way that it'll wrap you out of here
[51:51] so the promises every promise is that if
[51:54] there was ever anything reserved back
[51:56] it's not anymore
[51:57] it's all there and every fruit every
[52:00] promise every inheritance everything has
[52:02] been promised you just believe it
[52:04] and you become a branch
[52:06] you know you just you just a branch you
[52:08] don't have to produce anything you just
[52:10] yield and believe
[52:12] and you're just this faithful branch on
[52:13] the edge of the vine and he's just
[52:15] fruiting through
[52:17] oh my
[52:18] you don't have to do anything other than
[52:20] believe
[52:21] hallelujah i'm not go i will never get
[52:23] through it if i preach i just want to go
[52:25] through it so john 1 1 he says in the
[52:27] beginning was the word and the word was
[52:29] with god and the word was god
[52:31] the same was in the beginning with god
[52:33] all things were made by him and without
[52:35] him was not anything made that was made
[52:37] in him in him
[52:40] was life
[52:41] amen and the life was the light of men
[52:45] hallelujah colossians
[52:47] 1 15 it says who is the in the image of
[52:50] the invisible god the firstborn of every
[52:52] creature for by him were all things
[52:55] created that are in heaven and that are
[52:57] in earth visible and invisible whether
[53:00] they be thrones or dominions or
[53:02] principalities or powers all things were
[53:04] created by him and for him and he is
[53:06] before all things and by him
[53:09] jesus christ the son of god amen
[53:13] all things consist
[53:15] all things are held together
[53:17] you are held together
[53:19] he holds you together
[53:21] would you just believe
[53:23] just believe you know we try and figure
[53:25] ourselves out we try and work everything
[53:27] out we try all these programs and diets
[53:29] and everything to try and just believe
[53:31] hallelujah
[53:33] just believe
[53:34] oh my
[53:36] it works
[53:37] it's proven who believes it's proven
[53:39] tonight it's a proven reality that
[53:42] believing and having faith in jesus
[53:43] christ works
[53:45] hallelujah
[53:47] now be careful who you put your faith in
[53:49] you know who you believing in because
[53:52] you can believe in jesus but then you
[53:53] your actions are actually showing that
[53:55] you've got you're believing in the tree
[53:57] of knowledge and you begin to adhere to
[53:59] scientific opinion and you let that
[54:02] discourage you
[54:04] you let what the doctor tells you about
[54:06] your health discourage you but the tree
[54:08] of life is different
[54:11] now listen to your doctor if he's
[54:12] telling you to do something don't just
[54:14] be radical
[54:17] you know you want to be led by the
[54:18] spirit of god
[54:19] but just remember the the reality of the
[54:22] word is he has done it and there is
[54:24] nothing impossible
[54:26] if you just believe
[54:27] hallelujah and there is a tree of
[54:30] knowledge that we lean on i don't want
[54:31] you to to throw you into a complete you
[54:34] don't need to do that either you know
[54:35] that you don't need to completely
[54:38] divorce yourself from the society and
[54:39] become a monk in the monastery
[54:41] uh to to only have the tree of life
[54:44] you know um god will put you there
[54:47] we will get there
[54:49] we will actually end up 100
[54:52] reliant on the tree of life before the
[54:54] end because god will uh the devil is not
[54:56] going to allow us to even buy anything
[54:58] in the society we will be so ostracized
[55:00] so repudiated but just remember
[55:03] repudiation who knows what repudiation
[55:05] means repudiation is the rejection and
[55:08] the the absolute
[55:09] renouncing of the truth or of something
[55:12] and you know that's what they did when
[55:13] they crucified christ and when the word
[55:15] came in the opening of the seals and
[55:17] brother branham's message came they
[55:18] repudiated it they hated on it they
[55:21] pushed it out they defamed it
[55:24] and they crucified the word but what
[55:26] happened
[55:27] it released the power of christ upon the
[55:29] bride in secret
[55:31] and it became this this private ministry
[55:33] between you and him
[55:36] because it's not a public show
[55:38] it's not this big fancy thing that's on
[55:40] these big arenas and in stadiums and all
[55:42] of that it's a secret
[55:45] mystery between individual and god
[55:48] you know and that's exactly what he
[55:49] wants to do
[55:51] that's what he wants to do to you
[55:52] tonight that's what he wants you to have
[55:54] tonight amen
[55:59] and he showed revelation 2 1 and he
[56:01] showed me a pure river of water of life
[56:03] clear as crystal proceeding out of the
[56:05] throne of god and of the lamb
[56:08] in the midst of the street of it and on
[56:10] either side of the river was there the
[56:12] tree of life amen which bear 12 manner
[56:15] of fruits and yielded her fruit
[56:17] hello tree of life branches
[56:20] amen
[56:21] every month and the leaves of the tree
[56:23] were for the healing of the nations
[56:27] in john 6 53 it says here then jesus
[56:30] said unto them verily verily i say unto
[56:33] you except you eat the flesh of the son
[56:36] of man and drink his blood ye have no
[56:39] life in you whosoever eateth my flesh
[56:41] and drinketh my blood has eternal life
[56:44] and i will raise him up at the last days
[56:46] for my flesh is meat indeed
[56:50] and
[56:52] oh mate where am i there we are and my
[56:54] blood is drink indeed
[56:55] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[56:58] blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the
[57:00] living father has sent me and i live by
[57:02] the father so he that eateth me even he
[57:05] shall live by me this is that bread
[57:07] which came down from heaven
[57:10] not as your father's did eat man he's
[57:12] talking to the jewish people you know
[57:14] and they're referring back to these
[57:15] things in their mind he's saying no this
[57:16] is different now and it did but he that
[57:19] eateth of this bread shall live forever
[57:23] the very thing that adam lost access to
[57:27] that would enable him to live forever
[57:29] was now being revealed back to the
[57:31] people and jesus is saying eat me
[57:34] eat my word
[57:35] partake of it and the word eat in the
[57:37] scripture means to
[57:38] devour hallelujah who's hungry
[57:42] are you hungry
[57:43] amen eat the word amen don't just touch
[57:47] the word amen don't flirt with the word
[57:50] eat the word
[57:51] that means to become one with it and put
[57:54] all your faith and trust in it
[57:56] and then you become a branch
[57:57] and then you then you're now connected
[57:59] to the tree of life and has sat now
[58:01] comes through you and produces fruit
[58:04] but the same thing can happen on the
[58:06] other side
[58:07] if you put your trust and you know this
[58:09] is where
[58:10] and we're going to read it but there's
[58:12] any when you whatever you do in the tree
[58:14] of knowledge and whether it's
[58:16] jobs whether it's needed whether it's
[58:18] just entertainment whatever it is it
[58:20] will dull your spiritual seeing and
[58:22] hearing
[58:23] it does that it's just a natural thing
[58:26] that it happens because it's the wrong
[58:28] spirit
[58:29] it's not the spirit of god it's the
[58:30] spirit of the devil and yet we are to be
[58:34] in it but not of it don't eat it
[58:38] but you're meant to actually go and
[58:39] you've got to actually treat it as a
[58:40] tool
[58:41] so there's a tool
[58:43] you know
[58:44] you have to go and earn money right
[58:45] you've got to go and have a job you know
[58:47] you've got to go do those things but
[58:48] it's part of another kingdom it's not
[58:50] the kingdom of god
[58:52] that's why you hear so much preaching
[58:54] and things like that don't let your
[58:56] heart open to the entertainment of the
[58:58] tree of knowledge
[59:00] you know if you could only just cross
[59:02] over and begin to be receive your joy
[59:05] from the actual creator of joy
[59:07] you know i know this i may sound like a
[59:10] broken record but god created joy the
[59:12] devil didn't
[59:13] god knows how to give you real joy
[59:17] real happiness
[59:18] but you have to repudiate the tree of
[59:20] knowledge
[59:22] you have to just you have to disdain
[59:24] that thing and it's very hard because
[59:25] the flesh just magnetizes to it because
[59:28] the flesh is part of it
[59:32] you know that it's hybrid
[59:34] that's why it likes that but but but god
[59:37] says
[59:38] you need to love the lord with your
[59:39] strength
[59:41] so that means to bring your flesh
[59:42] subject
[59:44] you know
[59:45] and i've and i've been guilty of also
[59:47] saying oh my flesh all it wants to do is
[59:48] not serve the lord but actually the lord
[59:50] is the the lord has actually asked that
[59:53] our flesh loves him
[59:56] hallelujah
[59:58] you know what it says it says if the
[59:59] same spirit that raised up christ from
[1:00:01] the dead dwell in you it shall quicken
[1:00:03] your
[1:00:04] mortal
[1:00:05] body
[1:00:06] now he says that in the rising of the
[1:00:08] sun the prophet actually
[1:00:10] puts a effort into
[1:00:12] saying no it's not just for them like
[1:00:14] because i always you know you kind of
[1:00:15] think oh that's the rapture you know
[1:00:16] you're going to get quickened in your
[1:00:17] mortal body going to be changed and that
[1:00:19] is really the fullness of it but now
[1:00:22] quickened by the the power of the holy
[1:00:25] ghost
[1:00:26] amen temporary resurrections
[1:00:29] who's had a temporary resurrection amen
[1:00:32] oh my i've had a few of those hey man oh
[1:00:35] my i love it when this you know you go
[1:00:37] through a service and you did the lord
[1:00:38] just pours out
[1:00:40] and you just have a temporary
[1:00:41] resurrection into another place man
[1:00:44] you're just having a good time
[1:00:45] hallelujah that's the children's bread
[1:00:48] and he says if you eat of that bread
[1:00:50] you're gonna live forever amen
[1:00:52] and he's saying look here i am i am the
[1:00:54] vine and you're the branches and the
[1:00:57] devil will do everything he can to
[1:00:59] thwart your connection to his vine
[1:01:03] and it's it's a very simple connection
[1:01:05] like i said it's just faith
[1:01:07] it's just faith
[1:01:08] no fear perfect love he is perfect love
[1:01:10] cast out all the fear so that you can
[1:01:12] connect back on the vine
[1:01:14] it's just faith
[1:01:16] and the prophet says the reason is of
[1:01:18] fear is why we don't put our whole trust
[1:01:20] in the tree of knowledge tree of life
[1:01:22] and we look we can look at people over
[1:01:24] the years and ages that have done and
[1:01:28] you can see the fruit of it
[1:01:30] amen but then the same one that is the
[1:01:33] tree of life and like i said the devil
[1:01:35] will do everything he can to block us
[1:01:37] from being able to connect with with
[1:01:38] christ
[1:01:39] by making us busy by doing all these
[1:01:41] different things by fear in our life and
[1:01:43] it may be deep seated within us and we
[1:01:45] don't know why it's there but it's there
[1:01:47] and there's a reason why it's there and
[1:01:48] the lord will discern it for you
[1:01:50] he will actually discern that thing in
[1:01:52] your life to unblock that so that you
[1:01:54] can connect on the simplicity of the
[1:01:56] faith in christ but the devil will do
[1:01:59] everything to you as an individual but
[1:02:01] it's same as he did everything at the
[1:02:02] start of the church ages you know they
[1:02:04] were connected to the tree of life and
[1:02:07] you know they were in such a place that
[1:02:09] they could have just been raptured you
[1:02:10] know that they could they were imperfect
[1:02:12] love they were in this environment of
[1:02:14] perfection and yet
[1:02:16] and and they were they could have been
[1:02:18] raptured but it couldn't be at that time
[1:02:21] and the devil did everything he can to
[1:02:22] try and sever that tie and he began to
[1:02:24] corrupt things and he began to introduce
[1:02:27] the tree of knowledge
[1:02:29] into the church
[1:02:30] so the church became intertwined with
[1:02:32] the tree of knowledge
[1:02:34] and even in the reformations it was
[1:02:36] still intertwined but it was getting
[1:02:37] worse better and better and better a
[1:02:39] little less and less and less and then
[1:02:41] all these truths of the scripture were
[1:02:43] all scattered throughout all the
[1:02:45] denominations and then god sent him
[1:02:47] elijah the prophet to come and take it
[1:02:50] and consolidate all those truths into
[1:02:52] one message and that is the message that
[1:02:54] you're under amen
[1:02:57] and that is a revelation of him
[1:02:59] and he is the tree of life and if you
[1:03:02] just have simple faith in him you'll be
[1:03:04] connected back to the fullness of the
[1:03:05] tree of life again and live forever
[1:03:08] and that is the ingredients of the
[1:03:09] rapture
[1:03:10] right there is faith in him who has been
[1:03:13] revealed
[1:03:15] in fullness
[1:03:17] oh that is the message of the hour
[1:03:19] amen
[1:03:22] jesus said and there everyone dead
[1:03:24] eternally separated
[1:03:26] see
[1:03:27] talking about the same people in the
[1:03:28] wilderness but i'm the bread of life
[1:03:31] that come from god out of heaven
[1:03:33] a man eats this bread he'll never die
[1:03:36] see he's the tree of life hallelujah
[1:03:40] amen oh my god
[1:03:43] you know i feel so happy about this amen
[1:03:46] tree of knowledge
[1:03:48] now
[1:03:49] it says here
[1:03:50] oh i'm not actually so just to
[1:03:53] give you a context i'm not actually
[1:03:55] going to go right into like the genesis
[1:03:56] story in this service so
[1:03:59] that is actually later on
[1:04:01] we're just doing an overview of the two
[1:04:03] trees where they come from their
[1:04:05] ambitions and how to connect with them
[1:04:08] you know
[1:04:09] but we will just touch on this a little
[1:04:11] bit here
[1:04:12] so it says here and out and i've got two
[1:04:14] versions here because you know this
[1:04:16] version here is another version that
[1:04:18] just helps to understand the what it
[1:04:21] means so it says out and out of the
[1:04:23] ground made the lord god to grow every
[1:04:25] tree that is pleasant to the sight and
[1:04:27] good for food and the tree of life also
[1:04:30] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[1:04:31] of knowledge of good and evil
[1:04:33] and go and now this is in the set
[1:04:35] version it says and god made to spring
[1:04:37] up also out of the earth every tree
[1:04:39] beautiful to the eye and good for food
[1:04:42] and there's a break there and then it
[1:04:44] says and the tree of life in the midst
[1:04:45] of the garden and the tree of learning
[1:04:48] the knowledge of good and evil so now
[1:04:50] you have this introduction of a of a
[1:04:53] verb of learning
[1:04:55] now it becomes an effort
[1:04:58] now it's taking a whole new approach
[1:05:03] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:05:05] the tree of life is not learning on a
[1:05:08] human level
[1:05:09] it's given by revelation
[1:05:12] but the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:05:14] evil is actually the tree of learning
[1:05:16] the knowledge of good and evil it's a
[1:05:17] tree of human effort it's a tree of
[1:05:19] human achievement as a tree of pride
[1:05:22] to be raised up into a pedestal
[1:05:24] situation
[1:05:25] like the devil
[1:05:27] because he says i will i will i will i
[1:05:29] will and he put himself above the angels
[1:05:31] and he began to preach to them and he
[1:05:33] came up with a better solution a better
[1:05:35] civilization something a bit more
[1:05:37] interesting and bigger because when you
[1:05:39] look at christ and you look at the
[1:05:41] civilization of christ it looks simple
[1:05:44] and maybe to someone that's been eating
[1:05:46] of the tree of knowledge too long looks
[1:05:47] boring
[1:05:49] because you're feeding off the wrong
[1:05:50] spirit
[1:05:51] and then it looks boring because it's
[1:05:53] hidden away it says it's hiding in
[1:05:55] simplicity
[1:05:56] the love of god the simplicity of the
[1:05:58] gospel and the civilization that works
[1:06:01] perfectly and it's the greatest
[1:06:03] civilization there is the greatest
[1:06:04] atmosphere there is the greatest
[1:06:06] it's the most sustainable way of life
[1:06:10] is christ's way
[1:06:11] and and when you finally break into it
[1:06:14] you have such an amazing time
[1:06:16] you live this life
[1:06:18] and it's like
[1:06:20] you know i mean it's not it's not this
[1:06:21] big glittery thing but it's powerful
[1:06:24] it's real and it's
[1:06:26] it's like um what's the word wholesome
[1:06:29] and loving and the families just are
[1:06:32] better
[1:06:33] we're just a better people not by our
[1:06:35] own strength but by the love of god by
[1:06:37] the grace of god
[1:06:38] because you are
[1:06:40] coming under the the the leadership and
[1:06:43] the grace of the tree of life and he's
[1:06:46] bringing life back to you
[1:06:48] instead of death and separation but when
[1:06:51] you're feeding on the wrong tree and you
[1:06:53] become a learner and you're putting all
[1:06:55] this effort in and all your affections
[1:06:57] go into this other stuff
[1:06:58] then all of a sudden
[1:07:00] that you you almost can't even connect
[1:07:03] with the wrong the right tree anymore
[1:07:05] because ever since man began to eat of
[1:07:07] the tree of knowledge it
[1:07:08] separated him from god
[1:07:11] and the initial eating of that and
[1:07:13] becoming and i want to get to another
[1:07:14] thought here
[1:07:16] adam
[1:07:17] sorry
[1:07:17] lucifer
[1:07:19] in the beginning because the tree of
[1:07:21] knowledge of the learning of knowledge
[1:07:23] of good and evil was an option
[1:07:26] it's not you know like because before
[1:07:28] lucifer did what he did he chose to
[1:07:31] another plan and that plan of knowledge
[1:07:34] and wisdom was another option because he
[1:07:36] had free moral agency he could choose
[1:07:39] something so he made he chose another
[1:07:41] option and he was inspired
[1:07:44] by his own wisdom and teaching and he
[1:07:47] began to preach that
[1:07:49] and he became the very root of the tree
[1:07:52] of knowledge of good and evil he became
[1:07:54] the very inspiration behind it and now
[1:07:56] he was looking for branches
[1:07:58] he's looking for someone to believe him
[1:08:00] it's looking for someone to execute his
[1:08:03] will
[1:08:04] he's looking for people to have faith in
[1:08:06] what he's saying and he got angels to do
[1:08:08] it first and then he got eve to do it
[1:08:11] and eve became the first branch the
[1:08:13] human branch of the tree of knowledge of
[1:08:15] good and evil and she became a fruitful
[1:08:17] branch brother brandon said that she was
[1:08:19] of that tree
[1:08:21] and he said that she ate the fruit of
[1:08:22] her womb that fruit became the fruit of
[1:08:24] the tree of knowledge she put her faith
[1:08:27] in what the serpent was teaching her
[1:08:28] sorry the serpent was the first
[1:08:30] uh branch the first
[1:08:33] on the earth and the physical the
[1:08:35] serpent was the first one to subscribe
[1:08:36] to the tree of knowledge because he
[1:08:38] yielded his whatever however conscious
[1:08:41] he was he yielded his will to satan
[1:08:44] and then satan took over the serpent and
[1:08:46] then the serpent began to become a
[1:08:48] branch
[1:08:49] the serpent started doing what the devil
[1:08:51] was telling him started speaking for the
[1:08:52] devil and then eve she's like hearing
[1:08:55] that truth uh false truth and and and
[1:08:58] twisted perversion a perverted
[1:09:00] civilization a perverted way a perverted
[1:09:03] idea
[1:09:04] and she by believing that she separated
[1:09:07] herself from the tree of life and
[1:09:09] believed what the serpent was telling
[1:09:11] her and she in her own self became a
[1:09:14] branch
[1:09:15] because she yielded herself to the vine
[1:09:18] of the tree of knowledge so now coming
[1:09:20] out of the vine was her fruit
[1:09:23] and then adam did the same thing
[1:09:25] so now anyone this is now that's what i
[1:09:27] was saying i'm going to introduce
[1:09:28] another thought here anyone now that
[1:09:31] begins to subscribe to this becomes a
[1:09:33] branch for it if they eat it
[1:09:36] if they devour it
[1:09:37] are you devouring the tree of knowledge
[1:09:39] is anyone in here devouring the tree of
[1:09:42] knowledge anybody
[1:09:44] are you eating it are you eating it
[1:09:47] sorry i just i felt like doing that was
[1:09:49] it scary
[1:09:50] i hope you don't look at me
[1:09:53] don't eat it
[1:09:54] it should be scary
[1:09:56] i would not want to be devouring that
[1:09:58] tree because if you devour that tree
[1:10:00] you're endangering yourself of becoming
[1:10:03] a branch to it becoming fruitful
[1:10:06] for the wrong tree
[1:10:08] now that doesn't mean you can't go work
[1:10:10] you're gonna go work but you're not
[1:10:12] eating that because you've been called
[1:10:14] to eat something else
[1:10:15] the mighty angel came down with an open
[1:10:17] book gave a message
[1:10:19] and he says to you to you to all of us
[1:10:22] come and eat it
[1:10:24] eat the body word of the son of man
[1:10:28] what is that it's the best thing to eat
[1:10:31] and when you devour it oh my do you know
[1:10:33] johnny ate it all
[1:10:35] he didn't just eat a little bit he ate
[1:10:36] the whole lot
[1:10:38] amen and then he could prophesy then
[1:10:40] john had a message
[1:10:42] hallelujah john had something to go tell
[1:10:44] the nations
[1:10:46] and if you want something to go tell the
[1:10:47] nations then you need to eat the word
[1:10:49] and don't devour anything else
[1:10:52] amen hallelujah
[1:10:54] jesus prayed a prayer which i believe is
[1:10:57] like you know here's the son of god
[1:10:58] praying this prayer that they would be
[1:11:00] in the world but not of the world and it
[1:11:02] was like from that moment this mandate
[1:11:05] was on the devil hurt not the oil and
[1:11:06] the wine don't you ever cross the
[1:11:08] bloodline satan you have a restriction
[1:11:11] from that day forward my people they do
[1:11:14] need to go and work they do need to do
[1:11:15] these things they need to participate in
[1:11:17] certain things within that tree but they
[1:11:20] will not you will not cross them you
[1:11:22] will not take them and they will not eat
[1:11:24] of that tree and yet it'll become a tool
[1:11:27] to them like the money system you know
[1:11:29] the money system is a is a demon it's
[1:11:31] demonic it's demonic
[1:11:34] but you forgot you you know you've got
[1:11:35] power over them
[1:11:37] authority over the demons
[1:11:38] and if you've got authority over the
[1:11:40] demons and you're the head and not the
[1:11:41] tail you're in a royal seat of abraham
[1:11:43] then then you're blessed
[1:11:45] and then you follow the systems of god
[1:11:48] so that he can bless you
[1:11:50] and then you don't have to serve money
[1:11:53] money will serve you
[1:11:55] hallelujah
[1:11:57] man money has a place in our life and
[1:12:00] it's under our feet
[1:12:01] hallelujah
[1:12:06] not
[1:12:07] you know it's a lot of people
[1:12:09] money's up here for them and they're so
[1:12:11] concerned about it and when there's
[1:12:13] anything to fail about they get so
[1:12:14] touchy
[1:12:16] don't it's just a tool
[1:12:19] that's just a tool
[1:12:21] of the devil
[1:12:22] for his kingdom but i'm so thankful john
[1:12:25] 17 the lord prayed that prayer
[1:12:27] that they would be in it but not of it
[1:12:30] oh look because if you're of something
[1:12:31] then you are you know you are what you
[1:12:33] eat you know that if you eat a whole
[1:12:35] bunch of kfc and mcdonald's you're going
[1:12:37] to become real unhealthy and fat
[1:12:39] because you will
[1:12:41] that's not healthy
[1:12:42] but if you eat nice vegetables and
[1:12:43] fruits and a balanced diet you're going
[1:12:45] to become strong
[1:12:47] hallelujah it's the same thing
[1:12:48] spiritually if you feast and devour the
[1:12:51] wrong things then you're going to become
[1:12:53] spiritually fat and unhealthy and broken
[1:12:55] down and your spirit is going to be just
[1:12:57] broken
[1:12:58] but if you begin to feast and devour the
[1:13:01] word that's been handed to you too given
[1:13:03] to you hallelujah then you become strong
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:10] you see moreover the word of the lord
[1:13:11] came unto me saying
[1:13:15] ezekiel 28 11 to 13 it says son of man
[1:13:19] take up a lamentation upon the king of
[1:13:21] tyrus and say unto him thus saith the
[1:13:23] lord god thou sealest up the son
[1:13:25] full of wisdom
[1:13:27] and perfect and beauty so now we're
[1:13:29] tracing now he's speaking to this king
[1:13:31] of of of tyre which was a kingdom of the
[1:13:33] devil which was a natural kingdom but a
[1:13:35] devil worshiping kingdom and yet he
[1:13:38] wasn't speaking to that king he was
[1:13:39] speaking right through him and
[1:13:40] prophesying to lucifer
[1:13:42] and he's saying and so when you see this
[1:13:43] you'll see and he's because what king
[1:13:45] you don't know king attire even being
[1:13:47] eden you know
[1:13:48] it says here now they'll seal us up some
[1:13:50] full of wisdom
[1:13:52] and perfect and beauty
[1:13:54] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[1:13:57] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:14:00] thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:14:02] covereth and i have set thee so
[1:14:05] so you see now the lord enabled that to
[1:14:08] happen
[1:14:09] because he knew that lucifer and his
[1:14:11] free will would do what he did but then
[1:14:13] there would become a way for god to
[1:14:16] reveal himself
[1:14:17] and the attributes of savior and father
[1:14:20] and healer and redeemer would be able to
[1:14:22] be expressed and re avenger
[1:14:26] hallelujah i love the i love the
[1:14:28] attribute of avenger and not our
[1:14:31] avenging is avenging

[1:14:44] was upon the holy mountain of god thou
[1:14:47] has walked up and down in the midst of
[1:14:49] the stones of fire
[1:14:52] ezekiel 28 15 says thou was perfect in
[1:14:54] thy ways from the day that thou was
[1:14:56] created till iniquity was found in thee
[1:14:59] he was discerned
[1:15:03] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[1:15:06] have filled the midst of thee with
[1:15:07] violence
[1:15:08] what is his kingdom look at the
[1:15:10] civilization it's violent
[1:15:13] killing
[1:15:14] straight away
[1:15:16] kane

[1:15:19] when's that civilization and just their
[1:15:20] imaginations was just evil
[1:15:23] killing and thou has sinned
[1:15:26] therefore
[1:15:27] i will cast thee as a profane out of the
[1:15:30] mountain of god and i will destroy the o
[1:15:33] covering cherub from the midst of the
[1:15:35] stones of
[1:15:36] fire so you can know now you are a
[1:15:40] living stone
[1:15:42] sons of god the kingdom of god the
[1:15:43] temple of god and you are a son of a god
[1:15:46] who says he's a consuming fire so if
[1:15:49] gods are consuming fire you're a
[1:15:50] consuming fire because you're his
[1:15:52] children you're his family and if you're
[1:15:54] baptized with the fire of god then you
[1:15:56] become a stone of fire amen you become a
[1:16:00] living stone built up in the temple of
[1:16:02] god and fiery
[1:16:04] amen and god has promised that this
[1:16:07] devil that's covering over all these
[1:16:09] things and just brooding over everything
[1:16:11] and trying to take over and trying to be
[1:16:13] proud in your life trying to make you
[1:16:14] subscribe to his channel
[1:16:17] trying to make you eat his book
[1:16:20] he's going to be destroyed
[1:16:22] from your midst
[1:16:24] he's got an expiry date
[1:16:26] glory that's a rejoicing point there
[1:16:29] he's got an expiry date the heart was
[1:16:32] lifted up because of thy beauty thou has
[1:16:35] corrupted thy wisdom there you go this
[1:16:38] is now the lord discerning what he took
[1:16:41] wisdom and he corrupted it he perverted
[1:16:44] truth and he began to change things to
[1:16:47] his own agenda
[1:16:50] by reason of thy brightness i will cast
[1:16:53] thee to the ground i will lay thee
[1:16:55] before kings that they may behold thee
[1:17:00] brother branham says this he says it was
[1:17:01] satan's ambition to be worshipped like
[1:17:04] god
[1:17:04] and now he is ready with his careful
[1:17:07] selected educated bride by his own
[1:17:09] knowledge
[1:17:11] here you have now a revelation that it's
[1:17:13] his knowledge that is actually the very
[1:17:16] stream that comes out through that tree
[1:17:19] and when you put your faith in that when
[1:17:21] you begin to devour that you become that
[1:17:25] oh my
[1:17:27] never let anything that you participate
[1:17:30] in that comes from this tree be any more
[1:17:32] than at all
[1:17:34] any more than a utility
[1:17:37] to get you by naturally
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] amen never
[1:17:42] never raise it up any higher than a
[1:17:44] status of tool
[1:17:46] or utility
[1:17:48] because that's all it could ever be and
[1:17:49] if it ever becomes more than that then
[1:17:51] it becomes idolatry then it becomes
[1:17:53] something and and and god you know you
[1:17:55] think oh god as a jealous god you know
[1:17:58] he just doesn't want me to do anything
[1:17:59] but the reason is that his spirits
[1:18:02] behind the tree of knowledge brother
[1:18:04] branham says you can get to this
[1:18:06] education education until you get to the
[1:18:07] demon of education
[1:18:09] you know that and you begin to worship
[1:18:11] it because it goes
[1:18:13] it becomes a god
[1:18:15] and when it becomes that and it goes
[1:18:16] over that then you begin to eat it then
[1:18:18] it's going down into a place within you
[1:18:20] which is where god meant to be
[1:18:22] you don't want to invite the devil's
[1:18:24] ways in his tree of knowledge and his
[1:18:25] wisdom and his corruption
[1:18:27] into where god is meant to be
[1:18:30] never
[1:18:31] hallelujah
[1:18:32] remember god created joy
[1:18:35] he created the when you have the most
[1:18:37] funnest time in your life and you'll
[1:18:39] rejoice and have a good time you know
[1:18:40] whatever it may be
[1:18:41] just remember god can do it better if
[1:18:43] it's not from god
[1:18:45] god's got a better way he's got a better
[1:18:47] way to please you
[1:18:49] a better way to make you feel happy
[1:18:52] a better way to balance your life a
[1:18:54] better way to exhilarate your emotion if
[1:18:57] you need that and we do need to have fun
[1:18:59] there's nothing wrong with having a good
[1:19:01] time amen hallelujah there's a lot of
[1:19:04] healthy things
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] see all so he says by his own knowledge
[1:19:09] see all painted up in his deceit of big
[1:19:12] buildings and big denominations and
[1:19:14] paints of knowledge and theology and
[1:19:16] smart and intellectual and educated to
[1:19:18] to see the whole world and become a god
[1:19:21] that's what he done
[1:19:23] and he says here in adoption he says so
[1:19:27] god in his infinite mercy he saw that
[1:19:29] lucifer would do that
[1:19:31] if he created this
[1:19:33] he had put them onto a free moral agency
[1:19:36] that basis and you're still there that's
[1:19:39] right the tree of right and wrong is set
[1:19:42] before every one of us
[1:19:48] you make your choice
[1:19:50] it's your decision
[1:19:52] absolutely
[1:19:53] but
[1:19:54] once one decision will lead you into a
[1:19:56] life of hell and one decision will lead
[1:19:58] you into a life of joy
[1:20:00] and peace
[1:20:01] and some and then there's minor
[1:20:03] decisions that will just give you this
[1:20:04] and that whatever but decisions have
[1:20:06] consequences
[1:20:08] i don't know so while we do have our own
[1:20:10] choice there is a lot of wrong choices
[1:20:12] to be made
[1:20:13] that can be made let's not make those
[1:20:15] choices amen hallelujah let's be
[1:20:17] discerning you know i was talking to a
[1:20:19] guy last night you know you know he he
[1:20:22] was asking about voices and thoughts and
[1:20:24] all that and i said you know the power i
[1:20:26] said you've got authority
[1:20:28] but what good is authority without
[1:20:30] discernment if you don't know where to
[1:20:32] use it and what to use it on you know if
[1:20:35] you just got this you got it because
[1:20:36] you're a son and a daughter and you've
[1:20:38] got authority you can cast out a devil
[1:20:40] you can bind things and loose things and
[1:20:43] but without discernment
[1:20:45] you just still let the devil in
[1:20:47] you'll still let him run a rampage in
[1:20:49] your head
[1:20:51] but if you can discern that and go
[1:20:52] that's the devil and he's gone
[1:20:55] because he's defeated and i'm casting
[1:20:57] him out
[1:20:58] hallelujah whatever it may be
[1:21:00] discernment makes it powerful
[1:21:02] it actually puts a real
[1:21:04] uh
[1:21:05] cements your authority because now you
[1:21:07] know how where to use it and how what to
[1:21:09] use it on hallelujah and lucifer was
[1:21:11] here and and you're still there that's
[1:21:13] right the tree of right and wrong is set
[1:21:15] before every one of us you make your
[1:21:17] choice and lucifer was the first one to
[1:21:19] take the wrong road as i said before he
[1:21:22] was the first one to take that option
[1:21:24] and he chose to corrupt the word of god
[1:21:28] and then from there came this tree that
[1:21:30] went forth of this corrupted truth
[1:21:33] and it began to grow and grow and grow
[1:21:35] and now it's filled the whole earth
[1:21:37] and it started with for his free will
[1:21:39] and pride and him wanting to rise up and
[1:21:42] think he could do a better job
[1:21:44] but let me just give you a bit of a news
[1:21:45] flash if you look out there who can say
[1:21:48] he's done a better job nobody
[1:21:50] no one can say he's done a better job
[1:21:52] even them out there know it's wrong
[1:21:55] even them can say look it's wrong it's
[1:21:56] broken
[1:21:58] it's dope it's just broken you know and
[1:22:00] everyone's on drugs or on something
[1:22:01] whether it's legal or illegal they're on
[1:22:03] something to make them feel good again
[1:22:06] because their spirit is broken
[1:22:08] well they've just inherited a whole
[1:22:10] bunch of junk in their spirit from
[1:22:12] from an inheritance
[1:22:14] naturally speaking of corruption
[1:22:16] and darkness and despair and sorrow
[1:22:19] but then god comes
[1:22:21] and he says i can heal you
[1:22:23] i can raise up a stand in your life so
[1:22:25] you don't have to fall under that thing
[1:22:27] again
[1:22:28] you have to live in that atmosphere
[1:22:30] again
[1:22:31] hallelujah he says thou art an anointed
[1:22:34] cherub that covereth yes he tries to
[1:22:36] cover your genealogy and cover you in
[1:22:38] darkness and despair and try and make
[1:22:40] you be something that
[1:22:42] just less than what your privilege says
[1:22:46] you don't have to
[1:22:48] you don't have to
[1:22:53] the first one to take the wrong way that
[1:22:55] he began to draw after him hoggish
[1:22:57] trying to take all for himself
[1:22:59] try to override somebody else and that's
[1:23:02] where it started
[1:23:04] now listen to this
[1:23:05] that's where sin began
[1:23:09] god in his infinite mind saw it
[1:23:12] this is i've just said all this
[1:23:14] so i'll just read it anyway evil was an
[1:23:17] option that lucifer took and became the
[1:23:19] first shoot for the tree of knowledge a
[1:23:22] corrupted version of the truth
[1:23:24] his root was grounded in paradise
[1:23:26] drawing water from the river of life but
[1:23:28] corrupting the dna to bring corrupted
[1:23:31] fruit
[1:23:32] you know um it's like uh if you've got
[1:23:35] an orange tree and you put a tangelo a
[1:23:37] branch on it
[1:23:38] it's like orange life orange life orange
[1:23:40] life and then when it hits the splice it
[1:23:42] goes into tangerine
[1:23:44] it's actually not the same life there's
[1:23:46] a corruption gone on on the branch
[1:23:49] you know and we don't want to have that
[1:23:51] this is what the devil did he corrupted
[1:23:54] the and and he's feeding it says that
[1:23:56] that the spirit the rain shall fall on
[1:23:58] the just and the unjust and it says in
[1:24:00] the scripture i think we'll read it soon
[1:24:02] it says that he's he's planted by the
[1:24:04] river of life he's planted by this great
[1:24:06] river
[1:24:07] and he's feasting off the power of god
[1:24:10] because there's only you know but he's
[1:24:11] corrupting it
[1:24:13] and then we go and we just entertain it
[1:24:16] and we fill our homes with it
[1:24:18] oh my help me lord
[1:24:21] oh
[1:24:23] wrong dna
[1:24:25] wrong information you know
[1:24:27] it comes out all right and then it gets
[1:24:29] corrupted
[1:24:30] we don't want that
[1:24:32] he would soon take the war of corruption
[1:24:34] from the spirit realm to the physical
[1:24:36] realm through the human race
[1:24:38] and through adam losing his inheritance
[1:24:41] lucifer would be able to squat over the
[1:24:44] creation
[1:24:45] and i put down the bottom there possess
[1:24:47] your office adam it's been given back to
[1:24:49] you
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:52] this dominion is given back
[1:24:54] and now it starts with you as an
[1:24:56] individual
[1:24:57] before he can give you a dominion over
[1:24:59] the earth again he needs to see that
[1:25:00] there's dominion in your own life
[1:25:02] not by your own law and legalism but by
[1:25:05] love
[1:25:06] by true divine leadership
[1:25:08] by christ within you doing it
[1:25:10] and because adam you see adam he lost
[1:25:13] his inheritance
[1:25:15] there was no one controlling the earth
[1:25:16] anymore
[1:25:18] there was no one to to to keep the
[1:25:20] gardens anymore because god created adam
[1:25:22] to do it and to keep it and to say
[1:25:25] dominion over the fish and the sea and
[1:25:26] every land and all of it and he lost it
[1:25:29] so it was just sitting in no man's land
[1:25:31] so the devil's squatting over it that's
[1:25:33] why he's the prince of the power of the
[1:25:34] air that's why he's doing all these
[1:25:36] things and he can he tries to storm kill
[1:25:38] jesus and he then jesus rises up and
[1:25:40] shows that he's possessing the office
[1:25:42] again
[1:25:43] and now he's saying to you possess your
[1:25:45] office
[1:25:46] amen don't just let the devil trample
[1:25:48] all over you amen don't just let the
[1:25:51] devil just overcome you of all these
[1:25:52] fears make him regret it
[1:25:55] make him regret coming to attack you
[1:25:58] hallelujah you ask god for some tools
[1:26:01] ask god to give you some powerful wall
[1:26:02] tools and when the devil comes to you
[1:26:04] you begin to release the the power of
[1:26:07] god on the devil
[1:26:09] because you've got authority
[1:26:10] and you've got discernment because this
[1:26:13] message has come to give you discernment
[1:26:15] it's come to help you to know the
[1:26:18] to divide light and darkness and to know
[1:26:20] what's evil hallelujah
[1:26:23] and so if you know what's dark and
[1:26:25] what's wrong and you know when the
[1:26:26] devil's attacking you you know that
[1:26:28] that's the devil and he's exposed
[1:26:30] himself
[1:26:31] you know that he's showed his cards and
[1:26:33] you can see it's a bluff
[1:26:34] no matter what it is
[1:26:36] no matter how big this big problem is in
[1:26:39] your life
[1:26:40] he's shown his cards now he's he's
[1:26:42] exposed and he's a bluff and he shows
[1:26:44] you all this list of things that you
[1:26:45] struggle with and you can know it was
[1:26:48] defeated at calvary and you are free
[1:26:51] and you can now make the devil really
[1:26:53] have a bad day
[1:26:55] hallelujah
[1:26:57] just by possessing your office
[1:26:59] amen
[1:27:01] the lord is looking for us as
[1:27:03] individuals now to take back dominion
[1:27:06] by the dwelling of the holy spirit to
[1:27:08] raise you up above the authority of
[1:27:10] darkness
[1:27:12] amen hallelujah
[1:27:14] glory to god
[1:27:16] but remember prophet says and separation
[1:27:18] from unbelief he says
[1:27:20] in heaven what made lucifer jealous well
[1:27:23] he goes over in the north and puts him
[1:27:25] up a better kingdom
[1:27:26] he wanted a bigger kingdom a more
[1:27:28] brighter better prettier the devil
[1:27:30] always works in beauty sure he does
[1:27:33] that's the reason cain offered what he
[1:27:35] did for his offering but there was no
[1:27:38] beauty in abel bringing his lamb
[1:27:40] but abel had a spiritual revelation from
[1:27:43] god
[1:27:44] amen who's thankful for revelation
[1:27:47] oh my your prophet said the greatest
[1:27:49] thing you can ask for from the lord is
[1:27:50] revelation
[1:27:52] just lord give me revelation reveal this
[1:27:54] to me make it real to me
[1:27:57] oh my if you could ask anything just ask
[1:27:59] for that when something quickens to you
[1:28:01] you say lord reveal that to me make it
[1:28:03] substance
[1:28:04] in my life
[1:28:05] hallelujah you know when he reveals
[1:28:07] something to you it's with you forever
[1:28:09] the devil cannot take it from you
[1:28:12] hallelujah it's yours you've possessed
[1:28:13] it you've gained it it's now substance
[1:28:16] in your life it's part of you
[1:28:18] amen
[1:28:20] abel had spiritual revelation from god
[1:28:23] that's that that's what god would be
[1:28:25] pleased with and as we have said only
[1:28:28] through spiritual revelation can you
[1:28:30] ever know god you'll never know him by
[1:28:32] knowledge
[1:28:34] you see the devil his whole model is
[1:28:37] that you make an effort to learn
[1:28:39] something and you go to school and you
[1:28:41] go get a degree or a phd or you go do an
[1:28:43] apprenticeship or you go do whatever you
[1:28:45] do you live all these years and you
[1:28:48] struggle
[1:28:50] well a lot of us do
[1:28:52] some people just fly through it you know
[1:28:53] it's easy they've got like a real high
[1:28:55] big brain and it just works easy
[1:28:57] for some of us it's very hard and you've
[1:28:59] got to work hard and you've got to
[1:29:01] strive and that's the way it works for
[1:29:03] the tree of knowledge but not for the
[1:29:05] tree of life
[1:29:06] aren't you so glad
[1:29:08] he knew that there would be dummies like
[1:29:10] me that just needs revelation hallelujah
[1:29:12] and actually the the smaller that you
[1:29:15] can become
[1:29:16] the more he can reveal to you
[1:29:18] hallelujah
[1:29:20] you know you could have you could have
[1:29:21] no memory but if he reveals it to you
[1:29:23] remember it all
[1:29:24] because it's beyond that
[1:29:26] hello your soul is beyond your spirit
[1:29:29] amen if he just puts it in your soul oh
[1:29:31] my and then he begins to inspire you he
[1:29:34] said take no thought what you shall say
[1:29:36] in those days because it will be
[1:29:38] inspired to you
[1:29:40] hallelujah is higher than your memory
[1:29:43] never fear
[1:29:44] hallelujah because what's given to you
[1:29:47] is higher than your human spirit that's
[1:29:49] higher than your memory
[1:29:50] it's greater than it
[1:29:52] amen
[1:29:54] you'll never know him by knowledge
[1:29:57] because you see it's the absolute polar
[1:29:59] opposite
[1:30:01] it's given to you by revelation
[1:30:04] hallelujah
[1:30:08] i'm going back into ezekiel now and this
[1:30:10] is another
[1:30:11] um
[1:30:12] time where the lord is dealing with the
[1:30:13] devil and exposing him
[1:30:16] and he says here all the fowls of heaven
[1:30:18] made their nests and his bowels
[1:30:21] that's the tree bells
[1:30:23] and under his branches did all the
[1:30:25] beasts of the field bring forth their
[1:30:27] young
[1:30:29] and under his shadow dwelt all great
[1:30:32] nations so you you see all civilization
[1:30:36] is under the shadow of his tree this
[1:30:38] tree of knowledge
[1:30:41] and the devil
[1:30:43] taking him up to a high mountain luke 4.
[1:30:46] now that's why i had this picture here
[1:30:48] because now the devil now here's christ
[1:30:50] the second adam and now the devil is
[1:30:52] going to
[1:30:53] show his cards again and he says and the
[1:30:55] devil taking them up into an high
[1:30:57] mountain showed unto him all the
[1:30:58] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:31:01] time man that's pretty
[1:31:03] that you know
[1:31:04] you know you don't underestimate this
[1:31:05] enemy
[1:31:07] don't underestimate him
[1:31:09] because if he can take our lord and he
[1:31:11] can show all the kingdom of the world
[1:31:12] that are under his umbrella in the
[1:31:15] moment of time
[1:31:16] don't you think that he could this is
[1:31:18] why you need discernment
[1:31:21] this is why you need the sermon this is
[1:31:23] why that innocent thing that you think
[1:31:25] is okay to do
[1:31:26] may just be the thing that destroys you
[1:31:28] for ten years
[1:31:30] destroys you your whole testimony
[1:31:33] this is this is how the devil if you
[1:31:35] just let a spirit in
[1:31:37] it can just wreak havoc
[1:31:39] that's why discernment is so important
[1:31:42] so
[1:31:42] important and i just thankful you know
[1:31:45] i'm saying these things to you because
[1:31:46] you have it
[1:31:47] i'm not saying it to you because you
[1:31:49] don't have it because then it would be
[1:31:50] like a carrot in front of you that you
[1:31:52] can't attain but you've got discernment
[1:31:55] hallelujah
[1:31:56] it's within you take no fear
[1:31:58] have no fear just trust in the tree of
[1:32:00] life put your faith in him
[1:32:02] let fear dissolve
[1:32:04] because perfect love is here
[1:32:07] perfect love is here you know paulie was
[1:32:08] so happy when epaphroditus or whatever
[1:32:10] his name is told him that they had the
[1:32:12] colossians were so loving they had the
[1:32:14] love of the spirit around them then he
[1:32:16] started praying that they could be
[1:32:17] increased in knowledge and in the power
[1:32:18] of god and begin to work because there
[1:32:21] was love
[1:32:22] love is the basis of all operation
[1:32:24] love is the basis for fellowship love is
[1:32:27] the basis for progress and for grace to
[1:32:29] really abound
[1:32:31] for people to give their lives to god
[1:32:33] in their atmosphere
[1:32:34] and so this is where we're at we love
[1:32:37] each other
[1:32:38] and we fight for love
[1:32:41] we fight the devil not each other amen
[1:32:43] hallelujah
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:47] i think
[1:32:48] you're ready to fight
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:51] hallelujah
[1:32:53] amen amen
[1:32:57] hallelujah so he says for this is
[1:32:59] and the devil said on him all this power
[1:33:01] will i give to thee and the glory of
[1:33:04] them for this is delivered unto me and
[1:33:07] to whomsoever i will give it
[1:33:10] my this is very these are big statements
[1:33:12] you know
[1:33:13] you know we think oh well this is the
[1:33:15] whole world
[1:33:17] every country
[1:33:18] every kingdom every government
[1:33:20] is under this guy here
[1:33:22] under his tree of knowledge and and and
[1:33:25] then he's just got all this stuff going
[1:33:26] on and he's going to give this to the
[1:33:28] lord
[1:33:29] hallelujah thankfully the lord you know
[1:33:31] he didn't he wasn't even going to put up
[1:33:32] with that because he's going to take it
[1:33:33] all anyway it all belongs to the to the
[1:33:36] lord jesus
[1:33:37] he will and he'll take it back amen
[1:33:39] hallelujah and you know what he was
[1:33:41] going to take back first take it back
[1:33:43] within you
[1:33:44] because the devil's the devil was
[1:33:46] squatting on your land squatting in your
[1:33:48] life and so jesus said you know what i'm
[1:33:50] going to come down in the end time in
[1:33:51] the fullness of my glory and i'm going
[1:33:53] to enter into my bride and they're going
[1:33:55] to take back their land and they're
[1:33:57] going to take back little by little but
[1:33:58] it's all going to come back to them and
[1:34:00] this is where you're at you're taking
[1:34:02] back your land you're taking back your
[1:34:04] inheritance the devil try to offer you
[1:34:06] this and maybe you're right there where
[1:34:08] the lord is was in the wilderness and
[1:34:10] the devil's offering you kingdoms and
[1:34:13] offering you the tree of knowledge and
[1:34:14] offering you all these opportunities
[1:34:19] but you need to stand
[1:34:20] just like jesus and say get there behind
[1:34:23] me satan i'm not going to participate or
[1:34:24] eat of your tree
[1:34:26] i'm not going to eat of that because i
[1:34:28] know what that does
[1:34:29] i've got discernment i live under the
[1:34:32] power of an open book i live under the
[1:34:34] power of the body word of the son of man
[1:34:36] hallelujah true revelation of jesus
[1:34:38] christ hello i'm not going to put up
[1:34:40] with these things amen you've got to
[1:34:42] tell the devil you've got to address
[1:34:44] them and get oh my just deal with them
[1:34:47] hallelujah amen you resist them submit
[1:34:50] to god let god's power take over your
[1:34:52] life and then you begin to resist the
[1:34:54] devil
[1:34:55] how is that you begin to rebuke him you
[1:34:58] begin to cast him out you begin to pray
[1:35:00] for people you pray for your family you
[1:35:02] begin to enter into prayer
[1:35:04] hallelujah and you you got full
[1:35:06] authority over the devil
[1:35:08] amen if thou therefore would worship me
[1:35:11] all shall be thine
[1:35:15] but all that will do is bring death
[1:35:18] and then we're back to ezekiel 31 again
[1:35:21] since thus was he fear in his greatness
[1:35:24] in the length of his branches for his
[1:35:26] root was by great waters as i was saying
[1:35:28] before the cedars in the garden of god
[1:35:31] could not hide him the fir trees were
[1:35:33] not like his bowels and the chestnut
[1:35:35] trees were not like his branches nor any
[1:35:37] tree in the garden of god was like unto
[1:35:39] him in his beauty i have made him fear
[1:35:42] by the multitude of his branches so that
[1:35:44] all trees of eden that were in the
[1:35:46] garden of god envied him
[1:35:49] and brother brown says this and pillar
[1:35:51] of fire he says there were two trees in
[1:35:53] the garden of eden one of them was the
[1:35:55] tree of knowledge and the other was the
[1:35:57] tree of life man left the tree of life
[1:35:59] to eat the tree of knowledge and he's
[1:36:01] separating his self from god
[1:36:05] and ever since then by knowledge he's
[1:36:08] drove himself away from god
[1:36:11] god's not known by knowledge he's known
[1:36:14] by faith that's right and one of the
[1:36:16] greatest curses is because man is so
[1:36:18] acclimatized to the tree of knowledge he
[1:36:20] tries now to get to god by knowledge
[1:36:23] so it's not just he's having faith in
[1:36:25] the devil's corruption he's actually
[1:36:28] sincerely trying to find god by
[1:36:30] educating
[1:36:32] and there's seminaries and all these
[1:36:34] schools that are trying to teach and
[1:36:36] people trying to learn and trying to get
[1:36:37] closer to god and they're approaching
[1:36:39] them through the devil's system
[1:36:42] and this is why
[1:36:44] it's so important
[1:36:46] that we come back to the simplicity of
[1:36:47] christ
[1:36:48] and have faith
[1:36:50] real faith and say lord
[1:36:53] if if you find because you have the tree
[1:36:55] is known by its fruit and if your branch
[1:36:58] if you are not fruitful
[1:37:00] if the fruit's not there
[1:37:02] you say lord i believe but then you can
[1:37:04] say lord why is it that
[1:37:06] i feel like i'm not connected
[1:37:08] because it's just a simple thing he is
[1:37:10] the vine and you're the branches and if
[1:37:11] he abides in you and you and him then
[1:37:13] you will be fruitful and the tree of not
[1:37:15] life will come up through you and you'll
[1:37:16] be fruitful and there will be seed
[1:37:18] within your life and then when people
[1:37:20] eat that seed they begin to grow and you
[1:37:23] plant seeds
[1:37:25] you know this the whole purpose of fruit
[1:37:27] is to reproduce
[1:37:29] the whole purpose of fruit is to
[1:37:30] disperse seed
[1:37:32] hallelujah that's why he wants you to be
[1:37:33] fruitful he doesn't just want you to be
[1:37:35] it's not just an airy fairy oh you're
[1:37:37] such a loving christian
[1:37:38] it's so that life can come through you
[1:37:41] it's so that people can see you and eat
[1:37:42] the fruit of your life and and then they
[1:37:44] take the seed
[1:37:45] that's the whole purpose they can enjoy
[1:37:48] the sweetness of your life
[1:37:49] enjoy all the good things that come from
[1:37:51] the fruit of your life but the seed is
[1:37:52] what's important
[1:37:57] and the awesome thing is
[1:37:59] you didn't make that fruit happen
[1:38:01] it's just that you have the simplicity
[1:38:03] of faith and you simply believe in him
[1:38:07] and if there's a hindering thing where
[1:38:09] that where you connect to the vine maybe
[1:38:11] there's just like a little complex there
[1:38:13] or something there that's like are
[1:38:15] causing you to unbelieve and you just
[1:38:17] this is how simple it is lord
[1:38:20] why can't i connect with you and he'll
[1:38:22] show you
[1:38:23] it might come through the pulpit it
[1:38:24] might come through it might come in a
[1:38:26] vision or a dream or whatever he will
[1:38:29] show you
[1:38:30] he wants you to be connected
[1:38:32] he wants you to be part of the tree he
[1:38:34] wants you to be fruitful
[1:38:37] amen am i what's the time
[1:38:40] oh oh
[1:38:41] my my
[1:38:42] it's all reading from now on
[1:38:44] true of knowledge and he's separating
[1:38:45] himself from god and ever since then by
[1:38:47] knowledge he's drove himself away from
[1:38:49] god god's not known by knowledge he's
[1:38:50] known by faith that's right
[1:38:53] there were two trees in the garden of
[1:38:55] eden one of them was knowledge and the
[1:38:57] other one was life and when a man went
[1:38:59] off the tree of life to eat the tree of
[1:39:01] knowledge he always tried to figure
[1:39:03] things out from then on
[1:39:05] see that he's never he never has got it
[1:39:07] straightened out yet
[1:39:10] there's only one way to be a christian
[1:39:12] the word christian means christ-like and
[1:39:15] you can't do it you can't work it in
[1:39:17] yourself there's no way at all that you
[1:39:20] can do it you have to forget yourself
[1:39:23] die out to yourself oh my goodness self
[1:39:26] oh
[1:39:26] it can be such a pain hey who believes
[1:39:29] that oh man the ups and the downs
[1:39:32] but he says love me with all your
[1:39:33] strength
[1:39:34] so what is that now you drag your sorry
[1:39:36] flesh to church amen you dragged your
[1:39:39] flesh to use meetings you dragged your
[1:39:40] sorry flesh to pray drag it
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:44] force it until finally it starts liking
[1:39:47] it hallelujah and one day you're going
[1:39:49] to rapture and you drag it up there and
[1:39:51] finally thank you
[1:39:52] i stole that from brother donnie
[1:39:55] that one's got a lot of mileage in it
[1:39:56] but that's what you got to do
[1:39:58] sometimes you just got to force it
[1:40:01] amen you know i talked to brother isaac
[1:40:02] about going to you know how he says
[1:40:05] because you know we talk about how this
[1:40:06] one you know and they're just someone's
[1:40:07] just not coming to church anymore and
[1:40:09] it's like you know and he says he just
[1:40:10] says you know what doesn't matter
[1:40:12] sundays i'm at church
[1:40:13] period
[1:40:15] doesn't matter how i feel that's
[1:40:16] irrelevant i'm going to church
[1:40:18] and this is where you know you could
[1:40:20] have all these things going on
[1:40:21] everything up and down but no
[1:40:23] i'm going amen
[1:40:25] hallelujah
[1:40:26] you're always thankful at the end
[1:40:28] amen
[1:40:30] hallelujah
[1:40:31] you can't do it you have to forget
[1:40:32] yourself die out to yourself and let
[1:40:34] christ come in and live the life of
[1:40:36] christ in you amen we're now i'm
[1:40:39] finishing by the way
[1:40:41] this is actually literally second to
[1:40:43] last quote
[1:40:45] we're going 1600 miles per hour today
[1:40:48] still moving on because science is
[1:40:50] eating off this tree of knowledge and we
[1:40:52] are over here the preachers and we are
[1:40:55] over here the preachers oh the knowledge
[1:40:57] will only run so far
[1:40:59] then it falls backwards
[1:41:02] hallelujah but the tree of life has no
[1:41:04] end to it oh my we got untapped
[1:41:06] resources amen saints you've got
[1:41:09] untapped resources
[1:41:11] they don't diminish
[1:41:13] they just keep going and getting better
[1:41:15] and better and better
[1:41:16] untapped
[1:41:18] there's untapped resources for your
[1:41:20] healing for your deliverance for your
[1:41:22] change
[1:41:23] hallelujah for you to have faith
[1:41:25] hallelujah faith is not something you
[1:41:27] manufacture faith is something that he
[1:41:30] gives you
[1:41:31] i give all men a measure
[1:41:33] of faith he says in romans 12 11 or
[1:41:35] something he says that oh man every man
[1:41:38] has a measure
[1:41:39] it's given to you but sometimes it's
[1:41:41] severed by something and it might be the
[1:41:43] tiniest thing it might be a great thing
[1:41:45] in your life but god can deliver you god
[1:41:47] can respond restore that and reconnect
[1:41:49] you amen hallelujah but here it falls
[1:41:52] vectors but the tree of blood has
[1:41:54] untapped resources and you're scared to
[1:41:56] step out
[1:41:57] and take god at his word
[1:41:59] help us lord
[1:42:00] oh lord i believe help thou mind
[1:42:03] unbelief amen
[1:42:05] who who could echo that i believe lord
[1:42:08] help thou my unbelief
[1:42:10] i don't want to i don't want to be
[1:42:11] scared to take you at your word i don't
[1:42:13] want to be the one that's at the brink
[1:42:15] of the boat and he's walking on the
[1:42:16] water and he's calling me out and i'm
[1:42:18] too scared to walk
[1:42:19] hallelujah
[1:42:20] you think man that was a stormy sea
[1:42:22] who's ever been you know you've been on
[1:42:23] the inter islander in the storm and you
[1:42:25] you look out you think i would never
[1:42:26] want to go on that sea you know it's
[1:42:28] pretty dark and horrible and stormy that
[1:42:30] was what it was like for peter
[1:42:32] it wasn't like a nice you know how the
[1:42:35] children's stories depict this just a
[1:42:37] little thing this was sea story the
[1:42:39] devil was gonna kill them
[1:42:42] he didn't just do a little storm he did
[1:42:43] a big storm and now jesus christ at
[1:42:46] every wave and he's calling you
[1:42:49] whoever's been going up and down up and
[1:42:51] down up and down he's calling you to
[1:42:53] crest the waves now
[1:42:55] are you scared to take him at his word
[1:42:57] or have you got faith in him
[1:43:00] to say lord call me out i want to come
[1:43:02] out i want to step off the boat and i
[1:43:05] want to walk into untapped resources
[1:43:08] for you
[1:43:09] say for me
[1:43:10] for me
[1:43:12] untapped resources for me
[1:43:15] you claim that you own that it's yours
[1:43:18] that's yours
[1:43:19] these are untapped resources for me but
[1:43:21] i've got to have the courage now like
[1:43:22] joshua would be courageous to step out
[1:43:25] to step into the promised land and come
[1:43:27] under the captain's leadership and all
[1:43:28] those things but it took courage
[1:43:31] now i'm calling you to take courage
[1:43:33] be courageous
[1:43:35] because it is you know the devil wants
[1:43:36] to put fear but you see perfect love the
[1:43:40] one that you're having faith in he
[1:43:41] neutralizes fear
[1:43:43] he takes fear away
