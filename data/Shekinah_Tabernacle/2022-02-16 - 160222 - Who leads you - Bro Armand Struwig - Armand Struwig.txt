know the master of the wind we know the master of the rain we know his name lord and we know where we choose to place it father lord as we come tonight humbly before you lord you know nothing that can come over this pulpit lord is it's not from you it won't achieve anything father so tonight i ask that you were just anoint speaker and hearer lord lord i didn't come here to do a bible study lesson i didn't come here lord to just give him another sermon lord i just want you to lead so please remove me in the name of jesus christ you've proved so much this week that you are now met's lord and i want to come and say lord take this service lord may you hear your voice as brother ed said lord how perfectly it is lord that when you do the work the confirmation is there already lord so tonight as we start entering in as we start listening to the word i pray lord that you would help us father to come and grab that blessing and grab it and make it ours father don't let us miss it tonight in the name of jesus christ i play pray lord if there's any sick here if there's any that needs healing spiritual or physical lord if there's anyone that is in the dire need of a touch from you tonight father only you can touch them lord i pray that this will be thus saith the lord for them tonight with that demon that has been sitting there hindering them for all those years lord those those um lord those jebusites and those amorites and all those the the the the canaanites lord and all those little things that's just in our lives lords that bugs us lord tonight may we be released from that in the name of our lord jesus christ once for all cut our enemies off i pray in the name of our lord jesus christ lord have preeminence in this service in jesus christ's name amen amen hallelujah it is wednesday night saints it is wednesday night and uh we've come here to war and you know what the lord has already set the stage musicians thank you very much god bless you he's already have this battle we just need to show up so i want to encourage you it's already been set this meeting for all of us so just get your blessing out of us tonight amen um brother ed can you put me off the foldbacks if it's possible if i am on there i just don't like hearing my own voice sometimes amen i want you to turn to second corinthians six now if there's ever been a service that i am so not prepared for us tonight i i have a thought and i've spent time in the word and i've spent time in prayer and i've asked the lord to show me and i've got all these things that i put down but i actually don't quite know how it's going to end so that makes it open for him to come and confirm it so anything is possible because all that is coming over the pulpit has already been confirmed if we look at the songs that the voice is spoken so many times that voice that went forth has so many times that cover over this pulpit but tonight more than ever the songs the voice of my beloved brother it says we listen to that voice the voice behind the voice there's so much going on and we kind of forget to listen to that voice because there's so many voices out there so i encourage you shut those voices out shut them out right now and hear his voice all those things that confuse you all those things that everybody's man's opinion and all those things just shut it out for five seconds and let that voice our lord jesus christ speak to you tonight i encourage you it's not a long sermon it's very very nice and short i pray it will just flow and everything would work out for the greater good of god but my service and all i can really say is is his voice so 2 corinthians 6 and we go to verse 16 and he says and what argument have the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god and god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out of among them and be ye separated say of the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you amen and i repeat that and i will receive you and all that the father has given me shall come amen he says and will the father unto you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters save the lord almighty amen let's just just pray again lord jesus we have read the scripture we invite you now to come just here in between us lord and fellowship with us and lord whatever your word set out to accomplish tonight may be accomplished here in our meds lord and even the brothers and sisters that can't be here tonight lord i encourage lord that you would just just touch them as well may that voice speak just as loud to them tonight as to us all i pray in the name of our lord jesus christ amen you can have your seed saints amen um if we can get that slight show up please brother ben um can i turn that just give me a sec amen um so i'll tell you just a little bit behind it is i tried to teach my son meths this week hey ruben how did it go because what i forgot is he doesn't know all the rules he doesn't know that all the ins and outs and he's asking about the 12 times table and say i'm struggling a little bit with it and of course me being dead and and want to know everything about maths and i'm not that clever with math don't test me tonight please but i figured out some shortcuts that the teachers used to teach us but i forgot that he doesn't know them and so i'm starting with the 12 times 4 and it went to 18 times 6 and then it goes to 24 times 5 and man i'm just on the move and then it went to 123 times five and then it went a thousand two hundred and forty eight times six and i look back at the room and that guy's lost but you can see it on his face it's like some people when people preach at them and they look at you and they just like but they do because they you for that moment they briefly stepped out of the room and you missed it so i encourage you i do not want to come and give a maps lesson but don't you step out of the room and miss it tonight amen but it taught me one thing sometimes when you think you know a lot it's not always good because it's how it is revealed to the young man which makes it sits in there so i ask that the lord will reveal it tonight to you there is a reason for my shoes and i'll explain that as well it's me one of those weeks man satan was busy but i thought if i have these shoes and i can kick him out in the face okay because i i took my suit to work and i took my shoes to work and everything is still at work and i drove all the way to church and i showed up and just before i got to church i went what am i wearing and it's not here so i phoned my wife and thanked the lord she hasn't left the house yet but i only have the one period to choose so i thought hey let's put the biggest ones on because if you're going to step on your enemy and it's under your feet it might as well just hurt all right come on amen and that's why we're for real life christians there's nothing different to us we are just real-life people that love god and walk and no matter what we do god always has a little lesson in everything don't miss this children don't miss this god has a lesson in everything amen so let's let's jump into this who is leading you so my question is brother onyas preached about faith and how you can ask anything he can ask the jumbo jet you don't even have to worry about the hangar it's already sorted it's true you can ask he says would you ask in my name okay because the name of the lord has power and the world tapped into it and brother isaac preached on it one day no ye not you are gods and it's stuck in my head that we can actually speak and if we have faith we can re receive that that's why you have football stars that way of rugby stars but the thing is they give themselves to their hearts desire they don't give themselves to god first they give themselves to their hearts desire and that manifests because they have faith and they believe and they receive and they eat and sleep and drink and eat and sleep and drink and eat and sleep and drink all that desire that they have and that's the only thing they focus on but they miss the living god and they get what they want and we look at them and we go by why can they get that and i ask for healing and i don't get healing come on am i just preaching about myself i look at people i go he gets everything and he gets blessed and she gets blessed where's my blessing and i'm not saying the lord's not blessing me but sometimes we think in this little space and we forget that god works in all the other space but we're only here so so i want you to encourage them when you look at another christian or when you look at another fellowship or when you look at another brother or sister or anyone don't want what he wants because that's not for you amen not for you you are you and god made you thus because he wants to use you now i'm totally not on my notes but amen praise the lord so another thing because i wasn't prepared i didn't bring my charger for my tablet and that went flat so i don't even have my sub notes so i absolutely just trust in the lord tonight and he's just humbling me every day amen so we're going to exodus and exodus 23 now i want you to follow me because brother ed said about that voice and when he spoke about that voice i asked the lord how is this sermon going to tie in because i don't actually know why i have all these notes in order but they're not quite fitting and when everyone said it is that voice behind the voice it struck home and i said thank you lord because if you would ever know and brother ben and brother mumpo when you stand here and you don't quite know where it's going to go you need confirmation because the last thing i want to do is say something that would rebuke or anything against the lord and be held accountable for it so i encouraged you if you're tired stand up shake it out just stay here don't leave amen so now now god comes down oh moses comes down and god just spoke to moses he gave him an exodus tweet he gave him the team commandments and now he's going to tell him how to sacrifice before this and he's going to tell him how he wants his offerings and he's going to set a couple of things in order but i want you to see god is busy speaking to moses i want you to repeat this god is speaking to moses let's say it again god is speaking to moses amen so god is busy having a conversation with moses and he tells him this and this is why it's so important that we catch this he says behold i send an angel before thee now why would god want to send the angel before moses if god is first person speaking to him why don't you just say i go out before thee why would god say to moses a messenger angel is so important why would he say it if god is now having a first-person conversation to the prophet and telling him what he should do and how he should set the church in order and worship and all those things and burnt offerings and everything he says but i sent an angel before thee now who is this angel have you thought about it because sometimes we read the scripture but we forget what is the importance of what god just said because he could have said to moses right there said don't worry i'm just going to go before you and we miss it because this is what now the the the nominations for and they start cutting god up into into 15 different people and 20 different people and he's one but he's got a purpose for this behold i send an angel before thee and he says to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into a place which i have prepared so he says to you i'm sending you an angel i'm giving you the law i'm telling you what i want but i'm going to send you a messenger and this messenger is going to keep you in the right way and there's a reason for it because why did ma why did god choose man to preach the gospel so he says beware of him and obey his voice now there's an instruction he says i'm sending you a messenger this message has got a messenger is going to come with a message that message will keep you in the way as long as you obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him because remember that time they were still under the blood of bulls and goats he says but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak so who's speaking through this angel so is it the angel just speaking or has he surrendered himself and god sent the man on the earth and said i'm going to speak through this vessel and i will tell you the way obey that voice because god if you look a little bit back there when when moses was on mount sinai and it was the thunderings and the and the storms and everything what did the israelites tell him say we don't want to go up there you go up we scared we going to go back we we can't face god he's too great for us we're scared so god saw i need to do a different veil to send the message so that people would receive that message because god is sovereign god is almighty and and why does the angel say when they appear to the people fear not because it is something that if you would be sitting right here and an angel would pop right next to you right now you would get a fright and the sight of an angel isn't just a man in a white robe because why did he have to tell every single one he visited fear not and everyone he visited from mary to every preacher to every to every pole and soul and everything when they struck them down it is it is a mighty thing that they would respond my lord so sometimes we get a bit confused with this old doctrine about who's the angel and who's god and who's that it is god he just appears in a different form because god started the plan of redemption god is busy finishing the plan of redemption and that is what god's job to do so again in this season i'll finish there because i'm leaving this notes now but in this season in this seventh church eight god once more send the messenger amen and that messenger is there to prepare a way to a expected end he says to a place which i have prepared so when we look at this message of an hour and we look at brother branham and we look at all the things that happens it's nice to hear the prayer lines it's nice to see the miracles it's nice to hear someone being touched and and got their healing but what about here because the angel's voice is still here the angels is still leading us we are surrendered to christ we believe in jesus christ that's fine god was speaking to moses god was speaking to moses moses didn't stop believing in god but he had to hearken unto the voice of the angel do you get it it is not complex there is a person that spoke to no man before i was in the nomination churches and i was sitting there and nobody told me of hell they preached me into hell but they never told me what is the accusers what is the devil's tactics how can i defeat him how can i overcome why i'm here where am i standing in the church i just where am i going where did it all start and where's the greatest battle nobody could tell me what was going on they got all these doctrines and baptized this way and do this and they've got all these men's opinions but when it came to when the rubber hits the road they cannot tell you where you are so now i go to them and i say okay great it's all good i must believe in jesus christ he leads the church good who's malachi 10 who's revelation 10 7 who's malachi 4 who's that oh it's a priesthood it's a now the reason amen now the reason but none of that priesthood placed me in the land and joshua placed the people in the land he went and he placed the people in their inheritance and if they didn't listen to joshua they wouldn't have had the mountain yeah if you think about it if caleb didn't trust that that god spoke to joshua and joshua said is we gonna go around the walls of jericho six times go because now he's the mason journey so here comes uh uh joshua he's the prophet and he looks at the walls of jericho and i've said it last time i just want to maybe show you because this is where it started and he looks at the walls of jericho and he is the captain of the host but the captain of the host don't tell him i'm going to go in front of you and i'm going to bash those walls down he didn't do it and when the walls fell down it said nothing about the mighty captain of the host went in and broke all the walls down god did it how god did it i don't know how many angels broke those walls down i don't know but it wasn't the captain of the host the captain of the host said i've come to take over and this is what you'll do and he gave a message now joshua two choices he could have listened to the message or he could have still gone and say i don't know this is gonna work i'm just not gonna go back to israel because you know what if i go back to the hebrew children i tell him this is gonna happen he's going to go are you nuts oh no i don't know maybe it's going to work maybe it's not is that how god works but god knew because he said for moses i will send the angel before you and he will get you there but i want to see something he said for my angel shall go before you and you will bring you into the amorites the hittites the parasites the canaanites the evites and the jebusites okay question did moses face them so what is that that's prophecy and he says moses you might not see it like you see it now but i am prophesying that you will see that battle and i will cut them off because it's now there is a rapture you're going to go in a rapture it's not how i'm going to cut them off it's not when i'm going to cut them off i am going to cut them off it's not how i'm going to make it in the rapture how many truths and yes and amen or whatever i say god is going to make it happen all i need to do is listen to the voice because the voice keeps me in the way i don't i don't throw all this now away because i've got the voice this is all part of that voice moses and god was still one but he still had to get a messenger now why if god worked like that there would he change now if he's yesterday today and forever the same why would he do it now different because if he does it different now he made a mistake back then and then all we have now is just a bunch of confusion that's not my god i want to go on so now we go on to joshua 9 and now the wars of jericho has fallen down and now these kings says and and i'm gonna just paraphrase abyss but and it came to possibly all the kings on this side of the jordan in the hills and the valleys and all the coasts in the great tree over against uh lebanon there they are he died emma right canaanite parasite he jebusite prophecy what did they do they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua so now moses didn't see them but now the prophecy is starting to be fulfilled now the voice is coming to pass now joshua after moses told him all these things and he knows he goes into the promised land and god confirmed that he was with josh with moses as he is with joshua now now he knew that still had to be fulfilled so he knew what he was facing we know what time we are standing in we know our enemy we know how evil this world is why do you want to dip your toes in the world [Music] if we've been taught how evil and how deceitful this age is why do you want to go dip your fingers and your toes in the world what do you have there it's not your place it's not your promised land you cannot serve god amen at the same time you cannot have a little bit of the world and a little bit of god amen because what happens then the more you start putting your foot into the world the nicer it becomes and the less you start hearing that little voice and that voice is telling you stay in the word stay with god's word don't mingle with the world i am not making us some holy people that just sit in a word the whole day in reading no way i got a job but i am an ambassador to christ so when the enemy comes over my path and it says something contrary to what the word says i speak out if the enemy goes and does all their filth and all the people of the world go and drink and have parties and do all those things i don't take part of it because that's not my portion because i heard a voice in the voice said sustain from those things and i will put my spirit within you and you can resist those things because as hard as you don't want to drink as hard as you don't want to smoke as hard as you don't want to swear or curse or do anything like that if god is not doing the finished work in your life if you have not fully surrendered and said lord i cannot fight this battle he cannot take it he cannot take it amen so i just wanted to show you and that's where my notes went missing um i just want to show you that here comes here comes the prophet and he's speaking and he says good morning friends and he's busy talking to a congregation and i put on the tape and i listen to it and he starts talking about redemption by the blood of jesus christ about justification sanctification filling off the holy ghost a lot of people spoke about it and then the tape i listened to he says he was there and he was in india and i don't know why i'm sharing this but here he comes and he looks at the muhammadans and there's a blind man on the platform but god showed him a vision and he says to all of them and i'm paraphrasing because i can't remember it word for word and he says to him if your gods that you boast so much about he's god come up to this platform and give this man his sight he says because not even i can give this man in sight but if my god if my god and this is where the challenge is and this is why we have this message if my living god not a dead denominational god my living god comes here and he gives this man his sight will you give your life to the lord jesus christ not to me to that one that created heavens and earth and he closes his eyes and he prays for the man and he says lord on your vision that you showed me by your command same as that mount carmel experience when they were standing there elijah was standing the fruit in front of the bold prophets he said lord by your doing so by the vision you showed me i say lord grant this man his sight and while he's still praying that man shouts out and he runs off the stage now i ask you what has changed when lasted we see miracles every day where are you looking do you want this great awesome sensation we re god just do a multi healing or do you want to see souls birthed into the kingdom of god so have you ever thought your treasures that's up in heaven have you ever thought what those treasures are do you think it's just gold and silver because you've been a good steward i'm going to give you more gold the more silver but the pavement that we walk on is gold would you ever want to go to and i'm going to ask you brother marion you work with a lot of people a lot of tradies a lot of people think about it davey would you want one of them to go to hell not one so what are we doing where is the mercy seat of god you want to see miracles you listen to that voice you want to see people safe you listen to that voice because that voice keeps you in in line and in step with god so that god can move you to get those ones that goes wayward you don't need to stand behind the pulpit or play instrument to be a testimony in this world amen don't miss it don't miss it children don't miss it you don't need us to be a superstar to give someone eternal life is it too hard to say if i say you give someone eternal life if god's spirit is within you and you ministering the word and god draws him in that very moment and he reserves eternal life he receives the lord jesus as his savior amen there's a three-room house a three-compartment service one is your body what you do for christ one is your body what you do for christ not just boris spirit soul and one is a fiction so one is emotions the prophet says one is your body what you do for christ the other is your spirit what you think of christ and the other one is your soul the faith you have in christ this is what you are this is the tribe being you are you are not just a body that really acts to sickness and sits here and when you hit your finger you cry like a baby your body is there for the service of our lord jesus christ to do the work for him he goes on he sees a three-room house completely absolutely dedicated to the service of our living god justification by faith sanctification by the blood the filling of the holy ghost entering into a place of rest with god he says no wonder we have so many backsliding no monday wonder we have so many troubles in the church today because they don't come all the way with god till they enter into that place where they are dead so if you reason is it this way or is it that way or is it this and you and you fuss and you fight and you push back you're getting in god's way he goes on to say he says man dies out to his own intellectual thinking brother you preached it unless the seed goes in the ground and dies years old he's angry at the christians man the blasphemous people that's speaking against against jehovah i want you not to miss this saul is actually he's a servant of god he serves god with sincerity he's a pharisee and here comes this wild bunch of people and they say he's a guy called jesus christ and he is lord and we must serve him and it shakes him to the score and if you go to to um i'll tell you where it is just give me a sec i think i need to read this x9 and the first verse he says and saul yet breathing yet breathing out of threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord angry man because he didn't enter into that place he didn't he wasn't there yet he didn't die out to his knowledge he didn't die out to his doctrines he didn't die out took amelia's training and teachings and everything he didn't he was serving a god but he had no relationship with that god amen because if he had a relationship with a god god would have sent him that angel and led him into the way but then because god had a plan for him god sent an angel himself as a light and struck him blind but i want you to see god wanted to do it that way because if you look like the jews were blinded for us who was saul he was jew and god by this action where he strikes down paul a soul he strikes him down and he says i've blinded the jews you go to that man what was that prophet's name ananias and you get him to pray for you and then we'll start walking together because you are kicking against me you're persecuting me jesus christ not people and paul at such a moment where he had to go three years off the scene to go see what actually is going on but see he didn't just stop there when that voice spoke to him and said you know what now i'll just leave that experience there and i'll just move on because i am a pharisee of pharisees he had a change he had a different way he walked but this man went and seeked what was going on because he wanted to be very very sure this god that he met wasn't just a deceiving angel because the bible says if any angel preach anything else that is in this book let him be accursed so paul knew that he can't just trust any voice of any angel but that he had to throw all their thinking now away and go find out who this jesus of nazareth was so he had to die out to himself he says so the man and woman that is born of the spirit of god you may even be so brilliant intellectually but if you what if you are not born again your intellectuals has rotten away from your thoughts you are only and and you hold only to christ and he fills you with his holy spirit that is when things when this world becomes foolish and the love of god is in is first in your heart so who thinks this world is cool come huh i looked at some eevees the other day and i thought man that's so that's couple of the we get some clever people now you know we can put some wi-fi towers in the middle of nowhere and elon can beam us some some signals and we've got google google knows everything this world is foolish because they left god they left the tree of life amen and all they have is an intellectual thinking and they think they're right they actually think they're right and they think they're serving god they miss that if you would ask i would say 80 of christians out there today where do you stand today do you know what time it is they would not be able to answer they can say or wars and rumors of wars and all that they can't place them positionally at the seven church eights when that final trumpet had that the voice of god has spoken they can't do that gone because that voice doesn't speak to them but you are that voice i didn't know of brother branham when i was in south africa and i want to bring it and maybe close with this tonight because i want us to pray tonight i want to sincerely want us to pray and ask the lord to help us because i think we long lost forgot about the purpose of us being here and i'm not saying all of us i'm talking about me these people that need salvation these people looking for the holy ghost and if we take our feet and we it's too much in the world god cannot use you god cannot use you he is not saying to you be a preacher he is saying live a life that when somebody is looking for god they can see god in you not doctrines i came here with big boots i went to my first church camp was slippers on because i didn't have better shoes but i was so desperate to hear from god that i didn't care what people said about my slippers i was still gonna go for god what they never knew is that was my only pair of good shoes in my cupboard but i had a desire in me to meet that man that all of this people are living not speaking about living because i walked into this church and the brother put his arm around me and says god bless you let's go fellowship by brother benz and you know when people started receiving us and helping us and doing my garden when we was here in stokes valley 123 or 24 stokes valley road and we had house inspection and i had sisters and brothers i never met before and brother bendy working in my garden to help me i saw this is more than just a gospel yeah this is more than just some other denomination something touched these people and they walk differently but if we stop listening to that voice if we start feeding on the things of the world you are actually doing god injustice because all he wants is a microphone because he sent the messenger to someone brother andy was the first messenger i received and if you receive a messenger in the name of a messenger you'll give a messenger's reward if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you'll give a prophet's reward what do you want and as much as i kicked against it the life that i saw turned me towards this word because i was running as far away from it as i can don't miss that life i'm about to close jesus said in saint john 14 7 the things that ye do or that i do ye shall do also so why would god after he spoke to moses said i'll send the messenger then the messenger comes i'll messenger brother branham he does miracles he does signs he does wonders he preached the full unadulterated word of god what word what god actually wants his heart the in-between the line stuff that nobody preaches to you the why you can't do that not just don't do that the why but see what happens is people listen to the you can't do that and they shot completely down and they forgot the why because the prophet never came with you can't do that don't fall for that the prophet came with the why you can't do that he gives you the why the answer which nobody else gives you they just preach hell and and and brimstone and all these things on fire but they don't tell you the why all the mysteries that god has in this word all his heart has been revealed through this ministry of brother branham i believe it amen and i see god's heart and i see there's a reason why do things different and you know what doesn't bother me because i'm sold out to him not to brother branham to him he was just the one that said brother branham i'm gonna ascend because you're the prophet i'm gonna send my voice through you and i'm gonna speak to this adulterant nation which in that time started turning walking away from god and that's why he had to send the prophet and i'm not gonna go into that i think we'll do it later on because somebody the people forgot why god would send the prophet on that specifically that 1933 with the major visions and before that when brother branham started preaching they forget the why because the world started walking away from god into traditions and different beliefs and and everybody women can do whatever they want and men can be like if they want you can smoke drink or whatever and they started walking from what god has done for them and he said instead of just killing them all i'm going to send them a voice i'm going to send them a messenger a angel to keep them in that way are you kept in the way or are you busy going that way i found myself and this is where i would maybe close but he said these signs and greatest things shall we do those greater things is not bigger miracles our lord jesus calmed the seas our lord jesus spoke storms out of existence man there was no devil that crossed the road of jesus christ and that stood amen no demon we can't do greater than that we can do more of that because god and and acts if you read it very nicely he came down and he and he spread himself into the people of the upper room and his tongues of fire went and god said now i'm in a multi-member body and more than this they can do not greater we cannot be greater than god god is great amen i'll leave it there i'll finish with my testimony i was not feeling on the word for a while because i got too busy with my work this is me in fellowship that's why i want us to pray tonight each one of us sincerely and i started feeding on more things of the world found myself looking too much at youtube and and every night before i sleep it's just a quick video about some stupid thing that i don't even can remember and i found myself starting having friction starting getting pushing back against brothers and sisters and how they either enter the church or worship god and all those things and i thought this is not a good place and a bit of tension in the house not fights we're christians but see what happens is i forgot who i was yeah and for that one moment the world has just got me a little bit off the track and it kept me busy for a space of six months six months and then the lord said to me what are you doing brother wayne asked me to share a message one day and the more i started listening to the word again the more i started listening to sermons the more i started reading my bible the more i spent time in this precious word of our lord jesus christ my amnesia left me amen and i remembered who i was don't forget who you are amen if you are i encourage you tonight let's get back into this word amen amen amen because the world has been designed by our enemy to deceive us to mislead us but our god has seen the voice in this age to keep us in the way i encourage you get back to that voice if you don't understand it just leave it alone god will reveal it amen god as i stand here will reveal it so let us stand up let us just pray together tonight amen and if you have a need you lift it up to the lord i don't need an altar call god knows you're here musicians you can come up if you want to you don't need to play i'll ask you to play but then you can pray with i'm just encouraging you tonight really encouraging tonight close your eyes take one step back in your life right now for the last seven months say lord search my heart lord seek in me the imperfections lord bring it up where you can work and deal with it because you know what if you have a demon and you are being seduced by a seductive spirit and god doesn't reveal it to you you will not know how to overcome it because you have to bring that onto the surface so that sin could be exposed so that god could take that sin and deal with it so i'm encouraging us all tonight when we pray together i'll switch my mic off because i have a prayer as well to ask the lord to sincerely bring us back into the way and to show us where we are going wrong what right now and to help us to overcome that thing which is holding you back brother and sister from seeing miracles holding you back from getting healing holding you back from hearing his voice i ask you now in the name of jesus christ just make it right with him for he is here and we are not preaching because we want to he is here our lord jesus christ as he said with two or more gather in my name there i am in the midst so let us all pray together in the name of jesus christ lord jesus no matter what i feel no matter what i hear i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look in it seems like it's broken i'll lay a hallelujah [Music] [Music] because he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle in god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god a miracle working no matter what i see no matter what i feel no matter what i hear i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look and it seems like it's broken [Applause] because he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god he's a miracle he's a miracle he's a miracle working god a miracle working death a miracle a miracle breath defeating promise keeping
