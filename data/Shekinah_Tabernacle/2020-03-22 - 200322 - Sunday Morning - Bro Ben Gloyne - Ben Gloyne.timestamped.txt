[32:18] [Music]
[32:21] god is just as far from you
[32:25] as your mobile how many
[32:29] [Music]
[32:36] years ago
[32:38] mobile phones didn't exist
[32:40] we didn't worry about them because we
[32:42] didn't know them
[32:44] oh you could go anywhere we didn't worry
[32:46] about it
[32:47] then there was a time when you wouldn't
[32:48] go about without a watch on your hand
[32:51] you needed to check the time
[32:53] but before that you know what we did in
[32:55] the villages our grandmothers they'll
[32:57] dig some holes
[32:58] and they watch the shadow
[33:00] from the heart
[33:02] when it reaches a certain hole they know
[33:04] exactly it's 10 o'clock now
[33:06] and when it moves to the other hole they
[33:07] know it's half they survived
[33:10] there was no problem
[33:11] and then we came to watches
[33:14] so if you went around without a watch
[33:15] you'd feel naked where's my watch
[33:18] then we came to a time where you don't
[33:20] leave your mobile behind
[33:22] you jump in your car you want to go to
[33:24] work
[33:25] something tells you something's not
[33:26] right i forget something
[33:28] you didn't forget the lunch box or your
[33:30] big or anything but you forgot something
[33:34] you can't go because you forgot
[33:35] something you know what it is
[33:37] a mobile phone
[33:39] even when you're taking a shower
[33:42] the mobile phone is in the shower with
[33:44] you by
[33:46] could also attach to your mobile phones
[33:49] now this song says
[33:51] god is just as close to you
[33:53] you just telephone him if you need
[33:55] anything
[33:56] anything
[33:58] just telephone to glory
[34:00] there are no secretaries where you phony
[34:02] they're told oh he's in a meeting can
[34:04] you phone again in 20 minutes time then
[34:06] you phone again say oh he's still in
[34:08] another meeting
[34:09] oh it's like this now you just phone
[34:11] direct to glory
[34:14] he's always there he is the one who will
[34:16] answer you
[34:17] so whatever you need there are no
[34:19] secretors there there's no red tap
[34:22] whatever time it is 3 am 5 am you just
[34:26] talk to him and tell him what you need
[34:29] so this song is an encouragement

[35:09] built by the
[35:10] father
[35:12] foreign

[35:21] fail to get an answer
[35:23] satan's crushed your lie
[35:26] by some strong delusion
[35:29] or some their desire
[35:32] take away destruction
[35:35] god is on the throne
[35:39] [Applause]
[35:40] [Music]
[35:49] i
[35:50] can feel the current moving on
[35:54] [Music]
[36:08] nations
[36:09] cannot get control
[36:12] of this line to glory
[36:15] and cut in the soul
[36:20] hallelujah
[36:28] [Music]
[36:35] i
[36:36] can feel his current moving on
[36:40] [Music]

[55:04] because it's a very difficult
[55:05] environment
[55:06] amen but let's just go to the scripture
[55:08] first let's go to i've got a slideshow
[55:11] um
[55:13] here slideshows have never been my
[55:15] friend but hey it's a good time to make
[55:16] friends so let's just see how this goes
[55:19] i want to um i want to talk about lies i
[55:21] said a couple of um
[55:22] a couple of sundays ago you know i'm
[55:25] going to preach on lies and you know
[55:27] i i was really blessed by brother
[55:29] isaac's service he was kind of trampling
[55:30] all over real i wanted to go and i now i
[55:32] know what it's like for the shoe to be
[55:33] on the other foot you know because some
[55:35] brothers say i was going to preach on
[55:36] there why are you preaching you know so
[55:38] but the lord has a mind right so i'd
[55:39] like to say i'm thank you to brother
[55:41] andy too for the service on wednesday
[55:43] um
[55:44] so i'm going to try and drive this from
[55:46] here we're going to read a couple of
[55:48] portions here there's revelations 21 if
[55:50] you've got your bibles handy um and
[55:52] we're going to read verses 7 and 8 and
[55:54] then also verse 27 then we're going to
[55:56] go to proverbs chapter 6.
[55:58] um
[55:59] i just want to keep in your mind how a
[56:02] few sundays ago i preached on how the
[56:04] devil has no pardon us
[56:06] and
[56:07] lies are the devil
[56:08] we have no pardon lies lies have no part
[56:10] in us
[56:11] amen but so um i just i just we'll see
[56:14] how this goes so he says here
[56:18] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[56:19] things i will be
[56:21] his god and he shall be my son
[56:24] but the fearful and unbelieving and
[56:26] abominable and murderers and
[56:28] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[56:30] and all liars shall have their part in
[56:32] the lake which burneth with fire and
[56:34] brimstone which is the second death so
[56:35] notice his and all lies not some but all
[56:38] and revelations 21 27 and there shall in
[56:42] no wise enter into it anything that
[56:44] defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[56:47] abomination or maketh a lie but they
[56:50] which are written in the lamb's book of
[56:52] life
[56:53] i mean so if your name is written in the
[56:55] lamb's book of life you'll come to a
[56:56] point in your journey you will stop
[56:58] lying
[56:59] i'll just say that amen now rev uh
[57:01] proverbs 6 here oh you wait i've got a
[57:04] okay proverb 6.
[57:06] um
[57:08] and you know the the bible is full of
[57:10] god cannot stand a lie
[57:13] he cannot stand a lie
[57:14] and uh if the devil is the father of
[57:16] lies which we'll read
[57:18] but we have no part in him then how can
[57:20] lies be in us
[57:22] right so um i just pray the lord just be
[57:24] real personal you know because i
[57:26] preached to myself
[57:27] too you know
[57:29] this is not just to you know
[57:31] proverbs 6 and 16. these six things doth
[57:34] the lord hate yea seven are an
[57:36] abomination under him
[57:38] a proud look a lying tongue
[57:40] and hands that shed innocent blood and
[57:43] heart that devises
[57:45] wicked imaginations feet that be swift
[57:48] and running to mischief a false witness
[57:50] that speaketh lies and he
[57:53] that soweth discord among brethren
[57:56] amen let's just bow heads and word of
[57:58] prayer you're going to be remembering
[57:59] the prayers and raise your hands to the
[58:00] lord amen
[58:02] this is a very important time to be
[58:03] alive
[58:05] gracious father we thank you we can be
[58:06] gathered here in this way
[58:08] lord we want to magnify your name lord
[58:11] not just in song but in our lives lord
[58:13] everything we say do and think might
[58:14] glorify you may i give you praise and
[58:17] honor and glory because you deserve all
[58:19] the honor praise and glory my god father
[58:21] we've read your word lord your sacred
[58:23] word lord i pray you just come as you
[58:25] being the great author i'm so glad we
[58:26] can invite you lord into our midst and
[58:29] we can ask lord may you make your word
[58:31] live lord we haven't come to hear some
[58:33] intellectual
[58:35] seminar or
[58:36] anything like that my god we've come
[58:38] lord that you would minister to our
[58:40] hearts you'd make us more like you you
[58:42] would purge anything that's not of you
[58:43] out of our lives lord jesus that you
[58:46] would lift us higher and stabilize our
[58:48] walk or may just have your way for your
[58:50] glory dear god those who are connected
[58:52] by the way of youtube lord i pray you'll
[58:54] be very present in there in their homes
[58:56] wherever they may be o god may speak to
[58:58] them as well lord may change all our
[59:00] lives that we're more like your word
[59:02] grounded father in jesus christ's name
[59:04] amen
[59:05] amen god bless your friends you may have
[59:07] your seats uh this morning so
[59:10] yes so as we've read here you know the
[59:13] lord says
[59:14] lies are abomination there's six things
[59:17] but it says here a lying tongue but then
[59:19] in verse 19 a false witness that speaks
[59:21] lies
[59:22] and we've read here in in revelations 21
[59:25] that you know all lies will end up in
[59:27] the lake of fire this is real serious
[59:29] amen and all that maketh a lie will not
[59:32] enter in
[59:34] so i believe we're not called to fulfill
[59:36] that part of the scripture right i
[59:38] believe that the lord has given us an
[59:40] entrance by his supreme grace amen to to
[59:43] to dwell in the new jerusalem i mean too
[59:45] to dwell in eternity for eternity amen
[59:48] that yeah our names are written in the
[59:49] last book of life but we need to realize
[59:51] that so lies are a serious thing now
[59:54] when we think about lies and and i'll
[59:56] come to this later we think all these
[59:58] white lies and there's black lies and
[59:59] there's like a spectrum of lies but god
[1:00:02] looks at it all the same
[1:00:03] you know our human reasoning we like to
[1:00:05] quantify things since oh that's worse
[1:00:07] than this and this and this and you know
[1:00:09] but you know sin is sin
[1:00:12] god views it all the same he doesn't
[1:00:13] view oh this is a bit worse and this is
[1:00:15] a bit no it's all the same to him
[1:00:17] and so now we need to see where lies
[1:00:19] come from because we've got to realize
[1:00:21] that we uh you know we are we are
[1:00:23] reflecting
[1:00:24] uh
[1:00:25] either heaven or hell right and and we
[1:00:28] know that with our first
[1:00:31] birth i mean there's a lot of the devil
[1:00:33] in us that needs to get out
[1:00:36] right by our by our fallen nature that
[1:00:37] we're born with now we know we you know
[1:00:39] you know these bodies are not changed
[1:00:41] when we receive the new birth we're
[1:00:42] looking for a body change and this flesh
[1:00:44] will war against the spirit but if we
[1:00:47] stay a lamb stay surrendered amen then
[1:00:50] then this thing will stay in subjection
[1:00:51] to the spirit of god within us amen and
[1:00:53] that's that's what the that's what i
[1:00:54] love about the power of the blood is it
[1:00:56] actually gives us overcoming power not
[1:00:58] just to suppress things by our own human
[1:01:01] ability but actually to destroy it out
[1:01:03] of our lives and give us overcoming
[1:01:05] power over it i mean that we can walk in
[1:01:07] victory now jesus would say to the
[1:01:09] scribes and pharisees he says you do the
[1:01:11] deeds of your father then they said then
[1:01:14] said they to him we are are not born of
[1:01:17] fornication we have one father even god
[1:01:19] jesus said unto them if god were your
[1:01:21] father you would love me for i proceed
[1:01:24] forth and come from god
[1:01:26] neither came i have myself but he sent
[1:01:28] me why do you not understand my speech
[1:01:30] even because you cannot hear my word now
[1:01:33] notice they could hear it audibly but
[1:01:34] there's nothing in them to hear it i
[1:01:36] mean in their souls year of your father
[1:01:38] the devil and the lusts of your father
[1:01:40] ye will do he was a murderer from the
[1:01:42] beginning and abode not in the truth
[1:01:44] because there is no truth in him when he
[1:01:46] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:01:48] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:01:51] amen so if the devil is the father of
[1:01:53] lies i don't want to be producing any of
[1:01:55] his
[1:01:56] his deeds right my father's god right i
[1:01:59] trust you've come to a place in your
[1:02:00] walk where where the spirit of god has
[1:02:02] come upon you where you cry abba father
[1:02:04] or my father my father you realize god
[1:02:06] is your father i mean you're his child
[1:02:08] you're his offspring so if you're his
[1:02:10] offspring you'll begin to manifest him
[1:02:13] right because children are made in the
[1:02:14] image of their parents
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:17] sometimes you look down at them and you
[1:02:18] see your own fallen nature you say i'm
[1:02:20] sorry you inherited that one but the
[1:02:22] thing is the lord can overcome that in
[1:02:24] their lives and the same thing in our
[1:02:26] lives we don't have to live or put up
[1:02:28] with our fallen nature i mean but the
[1:02:30] lord by the power of his blood can
[1:02:31] actually kill that thing
[1:02:34] give us overcoming power i mean so the
[1:02:36] devil the devil's the father of lies now
[1:02:39] we know he wasn't made a liar in the
[1:02:41] beginning
[1:02:42] but
[1:02:43] in his own beauty and majesty that he
[1:02:45] has created pride into the iniquity as
[1:02:47] i've got highlighted there he says that
[1:02:49] was perfect in thy ways from the day
[1:02:51] that i was created till iniquity was
[1:02:53] found in me so before iniquity was found
[1:02:56] in him i say the devil wasn't the father
[1:02:58] of lies but because he got so lifted up
[1:03:00] in pride in how god had made him and his
[1:03:02] perfection and his beauty and you know
[1:03:04] all of his attributes iniquity came into
[1:03:06] his heart and then so he begin to think
[1:03:08] now
[1:03:09] i can do this better than god can
[1:03:12] and and and this is this is the biggest
[1:03:14] problem humanity has is we think we can
[1:03:16] do a better job than god can and you
[1:03:18] notice the world is is is is just a
[1:03:21] finger push to to total annihilation
[1:03:23] because man thinks they can do it better
[1:03:25] than god can
[1:03:26] right just like how brother abraham said
[1:03:28] the problem that you know preached a
[1:03:29] sermon the invasion of the united states
[1:03:31] he says the invasions happened you know
[1:03:33] the devil came in you know you know via
[1:03:35] hollywood he invaded the country and
[1:03:38] invaded the pulpit invade all those
[1:03:39] things you know invaded the home and he
[1:03:41] said the reason is because of weak
[1:03:43] pulpits because man thought i can do
[1:03:45] this better than god can in other words
[1:03:47] they'll take their their
[1:03:49] their bible school idea and what their
[1:03:50] counsel of elders say above the word of
[1:03:52] god and what they're saying is we can do
[1:03:54] it better than god can we can't do it
[1:03:56] better than god can god's way is the
[1:03:58] best way and the only way
[1:04:00] amen so so satan thought now i can do it
[1:04:03] better than you know god
[1:04:05] and so he begin to
[1:04:07] spin a
[1:04:08] tell a tale
[1:04:11] to actually cause other angels to fall
[1:04:13] with him
[1:04:14] because he thought he could do better
[1:04:15] than god can
[1:04:17] amen so i'm just showing you how this is
[1:04:19] where lies come from and if we have no
[1:04:21] pardon the devil and the devil has no
[1:04:23] part in us we shouldn't be lying
[1:04:26] right but you see iniquity came into him
[1:04:28] now this is the same thing with human
[1:04:30] beings there's a fallen attribute is
[1:04:32] there and it produces something
[1:04:34] god purges right now
[1:04:37] amen now the devil cannot create the
[1:04:39] devil can only pervert what uh the devil
[1:04:42] only perverts what god created that's
[1:04:43] the only there's only one creator that's
[1:04:45] god what is a lie is a truth
[1:04:48] misrepresented what is a bad woman it's
[1:04:50] a good woman that's been perverted see
[1:04:52] anything that's perverted perverters of
[1:04:53] the devil anything in its original
[1:04:55] condition is of god see god is the only
[1:04:57] creator and the devil cannot create he
[1:04:59] has to pervert what god has created he
[1:05:01] says keep that in your mind so a lie is
[1:05:04] the truth misrepresented so the devil
[1:05:07] misrepresented truth to the other angels
[1:05:10] and those ones that actually came under
[1:05:11] the influence of his lie fell
[1:05:15] amen now we don't want to
[1:05:17] come into that category but here we have
[1:05:19] in revelations 12
[1:05:21] he says here there appeared a great
[1:05:23] wonder in heaven a woman clothed with
[1:05:25] the sun and the moon under her feet and
[1:05:27] upon her crown was crowd of ten stars
[1:05:29] now i'm not going to go into all the
[1:05:30] symbolic nature of this but it's going
[1:05:32] to come down to verse 14. and she being
[1:05:35] with child created cried travailing in
[1:05:37] birth and pain to be delivered there
[1:05:40] appeared another wonder in heaven behold
[1:05:42] a great red dragon having seven heads
[1:05:44] and ten horns and seven crowns upon his
[1:05:46] heads and his tail drew the third part
[1:05:49] of the stars of heaven and to cast them
[1:05:51] to the earth and the dragon stood before
[1:05:53] the woman which was ready to be
[1:05:54] delivered for to devour her child as
[1:05:57] soon as it was born now we know the book
[1:05:59] of revelation it's a book of prophecy
[1:06:01] it's a book of symbols so there's not
[1:06:03] literally going to be a great big red
[1:06:05] dragon physically in in space going to
[1:06:07] drag a third part of the stars and cast
[1:06:09] them to the earth right this is symbolic
[1:06:11] in nature and what this is is the devil
[1:06:13] because all he can do is misrepresent
[1:06:15] the truth to tell a lie
[1:06:17] that's all he can do so he told the
[1:06:19] devils he preached to the other angels
[1:06:21] around him a lie to get them to to side
[1:06:24] with him to side with the iniquity that
[1:06:26] was already within him to to project
[1:06:28] that to to the other angels and what he
[1:06:31] did he actually his tail and and brother
[1:06:34] brown says here it's not literally his
[1:06:35] physical tale a t-a-i-l but a t-a-l-e
[1:06:40] which is a lie
[1:06:42] right he says he says you know so that's
[1:06:44] getting a bit small well hold on
[1:06:46] he says here now
[1:06:49] you know that what it was now his tail
[1:06:51] wasn't like a fork tail like they say
[1:06:53] the devil has got it it was that tail
[1:06:56] that lie that he told and the very jews
[1:06:59] by the roman empire crucified the lord
[1:07:00] jesus and over two-thirds of the jews
[1:07:02] denied jesus christ the stars which was
[1:07:04] in heaven and watch what he did and he
[1:07:06] cast now he's reading that scripture we
[1:07:07] read and he cast him to the earth and
[1:07:09] the dragon stood before the woman was
[1:07:10] ready to be delivered to devour her
[1:07:12] child as soon as as it was born now you
[1:07:15] say the dragon had something to do with
[1:07:16] the jews certainly they said this jesus
[1:07:18] says he's the king we have no king but
[1:07:21] caesar that's right see the devil's
[1:07:24] preparing them jewish hearts back there
[1:07:26] to deny jesus christ when he come
[1:07:29] can you see the devil denying hearts
[1:07:31] today to deny the power of the holy
[1:07:33] ghost when he come just exactly the same
[1:07:36] yet honest and sincere amen so the devil
[1:07:39] uses a tale
[1:07:41] to cause people to fall into a lie
[1:07:44] because it started in him and he wants
[1:07:46] to spread it
[1:07:48] right but you see now what so so it
[1:07:50] comes to tell a tale to deny the power
[1:07:53] of the holy ghost
[1:07:55] so if the devil gets in your mind you
[1:07:57] can never be free
[1:07:58] you can never change how you think you
[1:08:00] can never be free of something maybe or
[1:08:02] was in your grandparents and your
[1:08:04] parents are now in you and you cannot be
[1:08:05] free of it and you could argue just
[1:08:07] stuck this way you fall into sin and
[1:08:09] there's no way you can get out of that
[1:08:10] pit that's a lie and there's a devil
[1:08:13] trying to get you to deny the power of
[1:08:15] the holy ghost i mean because there's
[1:08:17] nothing that god cannot deliver a person
[1:08:19] from there's there's nothing i mean he
[1:08:21] can deliver from everything all all sin
[1:08:24] all bondage all lies all deception our
[1:08:28] god he says you shall know the truth and
[1:08:30] the truth shall make you free so there's
[1:08:33] power and the truth to free you and
[1:08:35] there's no sub-clauses of what can be
[1:08:37] freed from and what cannot be freed from
[1:08:39] no ye shall know the truth and the truth
[1:08:41] shall make you free amen i'm so glad we
[1:08:44] are living in a day and now where the
[1:08:46] spirit of truth has come the lord jesus
[1:08:48] christ and he's caused you to know him
[1:08:51] and there's a power in him to free you
[1:08:52] who's been freed amen by the spirit of
[1:08:55] truth hallelujah so never ever let the
[1:08:58] devil course he'll try and tell you
[1:08:59] you've gone too far you've gone too long
[1:09:02] you've said too much wrong you've done
[1:09:03] you've done all these things look at
[1:09:05] these scars and problems and whatever
[1:09:06] more you can never be free that's a lie
[1:09:09] that's a lie from the pit of hell amen
[1:09:11] that's the devil trying to make you deny
[1:09:13] the power of the holy ghost
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:16] but you see that's what the devil does
[1:09:18] he wants to misrepresent the truth
[1:09:21] that people can never be free
[1:09:23] now
[1:09:24] the devil's tactics have never changed
[1:09:27] his tactic has always been to try and
[1:09:29] put enough doubt upon the truth to make
[1:09:31] people disbelieve it that's always been
[1:09:33] his tactic and he's always bombarded
[1:09:35] with questions to make people doubt
[1:09:39] now
[1:09:40] satan satan in in in heaven told the
[1:09:44] tale
[1:09:45] and he basically put he could only
[1:09:47] pervert what god has done so he so so he
[1:09:49] lied to the angels a third of them fell
[1:09:52] by that tale and now because iniquity
[1:09:54] was found in his heart he projected this
[1:09:57] and then now
[1:09:58] here he comes down into the garden
[1:10:01] via the serpent
[1:10:03] and the first thing that's recorded that
[1:10:05] is said
[1:10:06] is a question
[1:10:08] yeah hath god said
[1:10:10] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:10:11] god he puts a question did that really
[1:10:13] happen
[1:10:15] did that miracle did brother brown
[1:10:17] really do this
[1:10:18] did he really go there
[1:10:20] why did this happen why did this do it's
[1:10:22] just all question question question but
[1:10:26] there's nothing for the there's no
[1:10:27] alternative
[1:10:29] there's no greater truth greater love
[1:10:31] greater joy greater reality of god today
[1:10:35] so he says yea hath god said you shall
[1:10:37] not eat of every tree of the garden so
[1:10:39] so he takes what god has said
[1:10:41] and perverts it just a little bit
[1:10:43] because god told them you know of the
[1:10:46] tree and knowledge of good and evil in
[1:10:47] the midst of god you shall not eat right
[1:10:49] so he took a lot of truth and put a lion
[1:10:52] there but he's just getting he's just
[1:10:54] trying to put enough doubt in eve's mind
[1:10:57] that she'll depart from the truth and
[1:10:59] take his lie
[1:11:00] see if the devil can get you to doubt
[1:11:03] then he's got you
[1:11:06] and the devil said i'm sorry and this
[1:11:08] woman said unto the serpent we may not
[1:11:10] we may eat of the tree uh fruit of the
[1:11:13] trees of the garden but of the tree but
[1:11:15] of the fruit of the tree which in the
[1:11:16] midst of the garden god has said ye
[1:11:18] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:11:20] touch it lest you die and the serpent
[1:11:22] said unto the woman ye shall
[1:11:24] ye shall not surely die
[1:11:27] so god doesn't really
[1:11:29] he didn't really mean what he said
[1:11:31] you know society's moved on and you know
[1:11:33] things have changed and opinions change
[1:11:35] and he's not really going to do what he
[1:11:36] said god's going to do what he said
[1:11:39] amen if god is really going to rapture
[1:11:41] people he's not going to no he's really
[1:11:43] going to take us off the earth he's
[1:11:44] really going to change these bodies so
[1:11:46] if he's really going to do that he's
[1:11:48] going to do the other side as well
[1:11:50] amen so i'm glad you know i'm glad
[1:11:52] there's a rapture for us
[1:11:54] i'm glad there's mercy i'm glad there's
[1:11:56] the blood
[1:11:56] amen now so you shall surely not die for
[1:11:59] god doth know that in the day you eat
[1:12:01] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:12:03] and you shall be gods knowing good and
[1:12:04] evil now they already were gods
[1:12:07] they were gods over the earth
[1:12:09] god told adam have dominion this is
[1:12:11] yours
[1:12:12] subdue it do what you want you are you
[1:12:14] are so they already work gods
[1:12:16] do they need to know evil no i don't
[1:12:18] think so
[1:12:19] you know that and you know that's what
[1:12:21] the devil wants to do to us you know oh
[1:12:23] you're too sheltered
[1:12:25] tries to open our imaginations in the
[1:12:27] wrong way
[1:12:28] too early with sex and different things
[1:12:30] you know try and push it down our
[1:12:31] throats young people try oh you need to
[1:12:33] know evil do you why don't you just know
[1:12:36] the good it's just like someone who who
[1:12:38] um who's an expert in in in picking up
[1:12:41] counterfeit dollars you know how they do
[1:12:43] that they study the true enough they can
[1:12:45] pick up a counterfeit
[1:12:47] right and it should be the same thing
[1:12:48] with us why do we need to you know see
[1:12:50] all the evil out there and say oh yeah
[1:12:52] this is what no no just look at the good
[1:12:55] i would rather live without the scars
[1:12:57] and i wish i never saw that
[1:13:01] amen
[1:13:02] but god allows that because you know
[1:13:05] he wants to give us victory
[1:13:07] now so so it's just yeah hath god said
[1:13:10] is this really how it should be who's
[1:13:12] following me today
[1:13:14] he just wants to bombard with questions
[1:13:16] did this really happen did that happen
[1:13:18] listen
[1:13:19] i don't need to go find
[1:13:21] um the ark to believe the noah and the
[1:13:24] flood happened oh but there's photos
[1:13:26] yeah in this photoshop what are you
[1:13:28] getting at but i don't need to go find
[1:13:30] it i don't need to go i don't need to go
[1:13:32] to jerusalem and see where zion is and
[1:13:34] see where david and did all these things
[1:13:36] i don't where is goliath skeleton
[1:13:40] i don't need to do that to believe that
[1:13:42] david killed that guy with a sling and
[1:13:44] cut his head off with his own sword i
[1:13:46] don't need all the relics to believe it
[1:13:49] jesus said blessed are you if you've
[1:13:51] never seen yet belief
[1:13:53] right so it's the same thing you know i
[1:13:55] don't need to go see where martin luther
[1:13:56] did all those things to believe that
[1:13:57] happened
[1:13:59] right oh it's been documented
[1:14:01] really
[1:14:03] oh you can't believe history anymore
[1:14:06] see the devil wants to put oh what up
[1:14:07] brother bram and different things well
[1:14:08] no no i don't need to go there and find
[1:14:10] everything to believe it happened why
[1:14:12] because i know and whom i have believed
[1:14:14] he introduced me to the god of the bible
[1:14:16] jesus christ and i know in whom i have
[1:14:18] believed i mean so so so my relationship
[1:14:21] with jesus christ is not based on what
[1:14:23] other people say i mean it's like if
[1:14:25] someone would come to me and tell me you
[1:14:27] know christine isn't really what you
[1:14:29] think she is
[1:14:30] and try and give all this evidence and
[1:14:32] you know if i never was married to her
[1:14:33] and live with her and and knew her
[1:14:36] i could maybe doubt
[1:14:38] you know her and believe them but
[1:14:40] because i'm married to her i'm in love
[1:14:41] with her i know her i mean i can say no
[1:14:44] what you're telling me is a lie
[1:14:46] because i have a relationship with the
[1:14:47] one you're trying to destroy
[1:14:49] amen it's the same thing with jesus
[1:14:51] christ i say this message is false and
[1:14:53] lies no no hold on it reveals jesus
[1:14:55] christ in the scripture
[1:14:57] amen it reveals i see jesus christ in
[1:15:00] the scripture it makes the bible alive
[1:15:02] to me and more than just wow look at
[1:15:04] that type and shadow no i see the god of
[1:15:06] the bible live in me
[1:15:08] which should be the purpose of that's
[1:15:10] what god wants to do living you and i
[1:15:13] but the devil puts questions and
[1:15:14] questions and this and this and
[1:15:16] you know i hold on and and you can see
[1:15:18] it with with with everything that's
[1:15:20] trending in the world today
[1:15:23] you know people put questions on
[1:15:24] vaccines
[1:15:25] for and against
[1:15:27] right or mandates for the yo they want
[1:15:29] to put enough questions out there
[1:15:31] you know and it's just but it's a it's
[1:15:33] the same spirit now we're not to be
[1:15:35] caught up in those things we're above
[1:15:37] those things
[1:15:38] right we are on our way to glory
[1:15:41] amen calling whosoever will come with
[1:15:44] it's wonderful
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] now
[1:15:48] um
[1:15:50] see and and so basically the devil he
[1:15:52] just wants to ask the question like like
[1:15:53] i said a you know a while ago brother
[1:15:55] kaijo brought this out to a youth
[1:15:56] meeting he
[1:15:58] you know your delilah basically said to
[1:16:00] samson tell me how i can destroy you
[1:16:03] i want my payday tell me i'm gonna
[1:16:05] pretend i love you no i just want i just
[1:16:07] want a few
[1:16:08] silver coins
[1:16:10] tell me how i can destroy you because
[1:16:11] the devil doesn't care how he just wants
[1:16:13] to destroy you
[1:16:15] right so so he say pray tell me i pray
[1:16:17] that we're in our great strength life
[1:16:19] and wherewith thou must be bound to
[1:16:22] afflict me
[1:16:23] delilah didn't care
[1:16:25] what she had to do
[1:16:27] she would have done it to find his
[1:16:29] source of strength to destroy him and
[1:16:31] it's the same thing with the devil today
[1:16:33] he don't care how he gets you as long as
[1:16:35] he gets you
[1:16:36] as long as he gets you to away from the
[1:16:39] truth
[1:16:40] he he doesn't mind how it's going to
[1:16:42] happen he just wants it to happen
[1:16:45] amen so this is how the devil works you
[1:16:47] know it's the same thing with eve if
[1:16:48] that first question didn't work he would
[1:16:50] have come another way and then another
[1:16:52] way and then another way
[1:16:55] you know this is the so she didn't mind
[1:16:57] what she needed to do as long as she got
[1:16:59] the sort the secret of samson's strength
[1:17:01] from samson
[1:17:03] amen now this is oh wait
[1:17:07] this is a um this is i think it's from
[1:17:09] the reunion island i just googled shark
[1:17:11] infested waters and you know i got this
[1:17:13] photo
[1:17:14] um but you see this is basically how it
[1:17:17] is the sea here is lies
[1:17:20] the island is truth i'm just making
[1:17:22] using this analogy so the devil doesn't
[1:17:24] care
[1:17:26] where you get off
[1:17:28] that's working
[1:17:30] he doesn't care what side of the truth
[1:17:32] you get off from
[1:17:34] as long as he gets you in here
[1:17:36] right so it doesn't matter if you come
[1:17:38] off this side of the beach
[1:17:40] with those people don't really care for
[1:17:41] you they don't love you you're this you
[1:17:43] know or off this side of the beach while
[1:17:45] the bible's been translated so many
[1:17:47] times you can't trust it
[1:17:49] he doesn't care what side you get off as
[1:17:51] long as you get him with these guys
[1:17:53] go swimming the water's fine the water
[1:17:55] might be fine as tropical but i don't
[1:17:57] want to get him with his sharks
[1:17:59] you know
[1:18:00] but see this is like lies as long as he
[1:18:02] gets you off the island of truth
[1:18:05] that's all he cares about
[1:18:07] just get in the boat you may get a while
[1:18:08] but you know it's going to get
[1:18:11] you're going to get chomped
[1:18:12] so i don't want to go stepping into lies
[1:18:15] why don't you stay where the truth is
[1:18:18] so but this is this this is the devil's
[1:18:21] you know he said the bible's filled with
[1:18:23] errors you know there's a whole movement
[1:18:26] in christianity that says the apostle
[1:18:27] paul is a liar
[1:18:29] the same spirit that's against brother
[1:18:31] brahms is the same spirit against the
[1:18:32] apostle paul they say the apostle paul
[1:18:34] was a pharisee and that's and you know
[1:18:36] the pharisees had hundreds of additional
[1:18:38] rules and things they added to the word
[1:18:39] of god and the apostle paul did the same
[1:18:41] thing and they even use the apostle
[1:18:43] paul's writings isolated statements
[1:18:46] against them to try and prove what they
[1:18:48] say
[1:18:49] but if you know in whom you have
[1:18:50] believed
[1:18:51] that thing doesn't shake you
[1:18:53] right you know the um
[1:18:55] you know uh before world war ii you know
[1:18:57] you know we know the lutheran church was
[1:18:59] very strong there in germany and the
[1:19:01] nazis were trying to break its influence
[1:19:02] upon the people and they brought up part
[1:19:05] of luther's writings that he was
[1:19:06] actually an anti-semite
[1:19:09] and they used a portion of that and the
[1:19:10] propaganda ministers just spread it
[1:19:12] everywhere say look this is what luther
[1:19:14] said because luther unified the german
[1:19:16] language you know he did culturally it
[1:19:18] was all luther was a massive impact on
[1:19:20] that country and so so they took a part
[1:19:23] of his writings and said look what he
[1:19:24] said but then the real believers knew
[1:19:26] what everything that luther said and
[1:19:29] they knew the heart of the man and they
[1:19:31] just just just basically discounted that
[1:19:33] part and they knew the nazis were using
[1:19:36] his writings to try and destroy the
[1:19:37] influence of christ in the nation why
[1:19:39] because that was just a father of lies
[1:19:41] manifesting itself
[1:19:43] amen because that why because they knew
[1:19:45] in whom they have believed
[1:19:47] other people be oh did that really say
[1:19:49] did he really say that
[1:19:51] he did
[1:19:52] but they knew his heart
[1:19:54] and they stood against it
[1:19:56] so we don't want to be caught up in
[1:19:58] isolated statements just like with the
[1:19:59] apostle paul or brother branham's oh no
[1:20:01] no if you know on whom you have believed
[1:20:03] which is the lord jesus christ
[1:20:06] those things will come against you so
[1:20:08] hold on
[1:20:11] now every every oh wait
[1:20:16] okay this slideshow is different to this
[1:20:18] slideshow we'll get there now here we'll
[1:20:20] we'll go this one every every lie has a
[1:20:23] lot of truth in it that's right now if
[1:20:25] it's a real lie just a just a right what
[1:20:28] we call a black lie or a little white
[1:20:30] lie the little white lie is the real lie
[1:20:33] you can see the big back big black lie
[1:20:36] but that's uh but it's that little white
[1:20:39] lie one that's got a hole
[1:20:41] like the one that the devil told eve see
[1:20:43] just one little thing off the cater
[1:20:46] that's what got our churches are
[1:20:48] listening to today they're saying oh
[1:20:50] you're right in your principle of
[1:20:51] baptism you're right in this you're
[1:20:53] right in that but he fails to let you
[1:20:55] know you've got to have love for that
[1:20:57] brother out there
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:01] though
[1:21:02] he's right or wrong stand shoulders with
[1:21:04] him the kingdom of god and the presence
[1:21:06] of god
[1:21:08] amen so he's saying he's saying this
[1:21:10] part's right but he omits that part why
[1:21:13] because it still stands today
[1:21:16] by this shall all men know you're my my
[1:21:18] disciples because you have loved one for
[1:21:20] another
[1:21:21] that has not been scrubbed from the
[1:21:22] bible it cannot be scrubbed it is still
[1:21:24] true today
[1:21:26] amen it's an evidence that we are
[1:21:27] disciples of the lord jesus christ
[1:21:29] because we have genuine love one for
[1:21:30] another
[1:21:35] amen but you see now
[1:21:38] god sends warnings across our way
[1:21:43] because lies they can start from what we
[1:21:46] call little white lies
[1:21:47] but then it can go into full blown
[1:21:49] delusion
[1:21:52] he says o
[1:21:54] of the stories of these 31 years around
[1:21:56] the world and around and around hearing
[1:21:58] the confessions and things they would
[1:22:00] they'd raise the hair on your head to
[1:22:01] think of the things that hear them
[1:22:03] confess or what they've started how
[1:22:05] innocent they was so notice how they
[1:22:07] started how innocent they was and how
[1:22:09] beautiful
[1:22:11] uh sin looks and how attractive it looks
[1:22:13] to be but it's the way of death don't go
[1:22:15] in it whatever you do shun the very
[1:22:17] appearance of evil the liar he never he
[1:22:20] thought he'd tell a little lie to his
[1:22:22] mother he went to eat some coffee went
[1:22:24] in and blowed his breath in the mother's
[1:22:26] face see i never i never smoked mama but
[1:22:28] you lied
[1:22:29] a red light flashes don't do this little
[1:22:31] boy it's not easy to go to hell you have
[1:22:34] to fight your way to hell every time you
[1:22:36] do wrong this little red
[1:22:38] light drops down in you and the
[1:22:40] countdown comes little boy don't do this
[1:22:42] little girl don't do that see it's
[1:22:44] something happens in you but you fight
[1:22:46] right over it you pass by the church you
[1:22:49] hear the people singing the gospel songs
[1:22:50] you really want to go in but oh
[1:22:53] my you light up another cigarette shake
[1:22:55] your head what are you trying to do
[1:22:57] you're fighting your way right through
[1:22:59] every barricade i mean so it starts very
[1:23:02] innocent but it doesn't end
[1:23:04] innocent amen like people can can can
[1:23:08] can can twist and embellish the truth
[1:23:09] about a brother or sister
[1:23:11] and it can seem so innocent to begin
[1:23:13] with but then it starts to a full-blown
[1:23:15] war
[1:23:16] between them
[1:23:17] it can seem so innocent so appears can
[1:23:20] be right but actually no it's not now
[1:23:22] notice this i said that
[1:23:26] um iniquity was found in the heart of of
[1:23:29] of the devil right iniquity was found in
[1:23:31] the heart of satan now brother abraham
[1:23:33] in the natural he speaks about how how
[1:23:36] that spirit of cancer gets in and he
[1:23:38] says it begins when a cell gets like a
[1:23:40] bruise
[1:23:42] and then and then a life comes into that
[1:23:43] bruise he says that cell backslid
[1:23:46] he said he uses that he says that's a
[1:23:48] big word for a baptist to say but but uh
[1:23:50] but uh uh isn't it but you do it anyhow
[1:23:53] it was a it was backslid and the devil
[1:23:55] put a german there called a cancer a
[1:23:57] tumor whatever it to be and they begin
[1:23:59] to develop cells and he begins to suck
[1:24:01] on your blood and that's what he does he
[1:24:03] eats you
[1:24:04] he eats you up by pulling your blood so
[1:24:08] part of the body gets bruised by
[1:24:10] something and then and then the devil
[1:24:12] puts his life puts a demon life into
[1:24:15] that and then it begins to grow and feed
[1:24:17] off the very life i mean that's in a
[1:24:20] person
[1:24:21] and then he says here for instance i'll
[1:24:22] take to speak for a few moments about
[1:24:24] cancer it seems to be one of the major
[1:24:25] enemies today what is it what is a
[1:24:27] cancer where did it come from tumor
[1:24:29] cataract ulcer
[1:24:30] pneumonia tuberculosis all those names
[1:24:33] are medical names that medical science
[1:24:35] gave them the bible declares them to be
[1:24:37] devils for instance cancer what is
[1:24:40] cancer it usually comes from a bruise
[1:24:42] all natural things of the earth type the
[1:24:44] spiritual everything in the natural
[1:24:46] types are spiritual you know that most
[1:24:48] of you all i mean most all of you so
[1:24:51] you're saying in the natural
[1:24:53] now if someone if someone has a bruce
[1:24:55] cell then then the enemy can slip into
[1:24:58] that and cause a cancer to grow he says
[1:25:01] all night natural things type the
[1:25:03] spiritual so now you can be bruised in
[1:25:05] your spirit
[1:25:06] right you can be bruised by what people
[1:25:08] say or things happen in life hardship
[1:25:10] can come and disagreements and stress
[1:25:13] and trouble and it can actually cause a
[1:25:15] bruise in your spirit now that bruise
[1:25:17] now the devil can enter into that bruise
[1:25:19] in the spirit and begin to operate
[1:25:22] and so now what that can do is he what
[1:25:24] he wants to do is put his attributes in
[1:25:26] you
[1:25:27] and use your spirit to project himself
[1:25:30] just like the devil amen he he want to
[1:25:33] gather those angels to project his will
[1:25:36] through those angels right so the same
[1:25:38] thing when the when the devil sets up a
[1:25:40] stronghold in someone's spirit is
[1:25:41] because he wants to use that stronghold
[1:25:43] not only to suck the life out of them
[1:25:45] but to suck the life out of other people
[1:25:48] i mean so now now what happens with lies
[1:25:51] lies can actually manifest because of a
[1:25:53] bruise little child can feel very
[1:25:55] insecure they can come among a group of
[1:25:57] friends and they want to please that
[1:25:58] friend or please that group and they you
[1:26:00] know and then you know you know the
[1:26:02] group will ask them something and
[1:26:03] they're embarrassed and they begin to
[1:26:05] tell a lie to save face
[1:26:07] and they can just grow from that what is
[1:26:08] that a bruise can happen now but i want
[1:26:11] you to know from this you know i just
[1:26:12] want you to know from the get-go
[1:26:14] the word we are washed by the water of
[1:26:17] the word
[1:26:18] right the lord cleanses these things
[1:26:19] from us right that's why we gather
[1:26:21] that's why we read that's why we listen
[1:26:23] i mean for the word to wash us off these
[1:26:24] things so i want you to know there's not
[1:26:27] a natural
[1:26:28] someone without the lord there's a
[1:26:29] natural progression
[1:26:31] of life goes to death right but god
[1:26:34] interrupts that i mean he brings life i
[1:26:37] mean he brings truth he takes the air
[1:26:39] away and brings truth he brings healing
[1:26:41] and restoration so i don't want you to
[1:26:43] think well i started on this journey
[1:26:45] decades ago however when you're a little
[1:26:48] child and i'm stuck on this way you
[1:26:49] don't have to be stuck on this way i
[1:26:51] mean you can step off this this this
[1:26:53] hamster wheel the devil's got you on i
[1:26:56] mean and walk with the lord in truth
[1:26:59] but you see that's what happens is as
[1:27:01] people feel embarrassed and they feel
[1:27:03] you know uncomfortable and so so they
[1:27:05] embellish the truth or tell a bit of a
[1:27:06] lie to save face or try and try and make
[1:27:10] themselves look better than they
[1:27:11] actually are why because a bruise
[1:27:16] this is how it starts now he says look
[1:27:18] at the condition he was in now now this
[1:27:20] is abraham
[1:27:22] abraham's the father of faith
[1:27:24] amen we're the children of abraham
[1:27:26] we're the spiritual children of abraham
[1:27:28] hello children of abraham we're having a
[1:27:30] family reunion today how you doing
[1:27:33] praise the lord
[1:27:34] amen but you see abraham backslid
[1:27:38] because there was drought there was
[1:27:39] trouble in the promised land
[1:27:41] and so
[1:27:42] look at the condition he is in
[1:27:44] backslidden sure he was god took him
[1:27:47] sorry god told him to stay in palestine
[1:27:49] and he left palestine he was backslid he
[1:27:52] was sitting down there just telling a
[1:27:54] little white lie what did he tell them
[1:27:57] because his wife sarah was beautiful he
[1:27:59] said
[1:28:00] tell them that we are brother and sister
[1:28:03] now that was partially true because they
[1:28:05] were half brother and sister but you see
[1:28:08] a little error with the truth is a lie
[1:28:11] and little error with the truth brings
[1:28:13] forth death see the devil told the devil
[1:28:16] told partial truth
[1:28:18] it was partial light but it brought
[1:28:20] death so part of the truth actually
[1:28:23] doesn't bring the full it doesn't bring
[1:28:26] liberty it brings death right you shall
[1:28:29] know the truth not part of the truth and
[1:28:31] the truth shall make you free
[1:28:34] amen so a part of truth pardon me it
[1:28:36] just brings death ultimately it may help
[1:28:39] in a small measure but it doesn't
[1:28:40] actually bring its desired effect
[1:28:43] hey hello amen so so we don't want part
[1:28:46] of the truth we want all the truth
[1:28:48] because we want to be free indeed
[1:28:50] amen
[1:28:51] that's why jesus died on calvary that
[1:28:53] would be free indeed
[1:28:55] amen so so he was back suddenly he told
[1:28:57] us he told his wife you know
[1:29:00] they'll kill me to take you just say
[1:29:02] that we are brother and sister and that
[1:29:04] was partially true but it was a little
[1:29:05] white lie
[1:29:06] and then that lie had great consequences
[1:29:09] you know because because the king saw
[1:29:12] saw she was beautiful wanted to marry
[1:29:14] her you know the night before the
[1:29:15] wedding he gets on his pajamas he says
[1:29:17] his prayers and god says so you're as
[1:29:19] good as a dead man
[1:29:21] you're as good as a dead man he says
[1:29:23] what do you mean you know the integrity
[1:29:24] of my heart i've done anything wrong he
[1:29:26] said no you're going to marry that man's
[1:29:28] wife
[1:29:30] and you know you better restore his wife
[1:29:32] to her his wife to him otherwise you're
[1:29:34] as good as a dead man so that lie was
[1:29:38] going to have great consequences on his
[1:29:40] kingdom
[1:29:41] just a little white one
[1:29:44] help us lord jesus
[1:29:45] we don't want to just tell as i said
[1:29:47] there's not white lies and black lives
[1:29:49] it's all the same
[1:29:51] but abraham was just trying to
[1:29:53] save face and just try to you know keep
[1:29:56] his own skin intact
[1:29:59] but god can't back up a lie he can only
[1:30:01] back up truth
[1:30:05] he says sitting out there lying
[1:30:07] and a man that would say against a um
[1:30:09] against his wife to save his own neck
[1:30:11] are you worthy is that see what am i
[1:30:14] trying to do show you that it's god's
[1:30:16] grace that made you worthy
[1:30:18] amen you're no good i'm no good but he's
[1:30:20] the one that's good look to him he's the
[1:30:22] one that did it hasn't been hadn't been
[1:30:25] for god's grace abraham sat there lied
[1:30:27] was he lying did he do it he said that's
[1:30:30] my sister it's a little white lie
[1:30:32] they're big black ones
[1:30:36] amen
[1:30:37] now
[1:30:38] some of the biggest lies ever told
[1:30:40] are mostly truth as as i read that quote
[1:30:43] earlier
[1:30:44] eliza truth
[1:30:46] misrepresented
[1:30:48] so
[1:30:49] this is a a great devil's tactic right
[1:30:51] here what is the biggest lie that was
[1:30:52] ever told it's got 99 truth in it if
[1:30:55] someone said william branham on this
[1:30:56] certain date was up yonder and houston
[1:30:58] texas drunk as he could be that's a lie
[1:31:00] see oh say no he was in phoenix arizona
[1:31:04] who was preaching to the christian
[1:31:05] businessman he preached on a certain
[1:31:07] subject so many people was there they
[1:31:09] listened to till about 10 30 and then at
[1:31:11] 10 30 you know what he done reached down
[1:31:14] and took a drink of liquor and took it
[1:31:17] now there is a lie the rest of it was
[1:31:19] all true see it has to look just exactly
[1:31:22] like the truth to be deceiving
[1:31:26] and this is what critics do they make it
[1:31:28] look exactly like the truth to be
[1:31:29] deceiving
[1:31:32] we don't want to fall in that bracket
[1:31:35] we must tell the truth
[1:31:38] even if it's a detriment to our own self
[1:31:40] we must tell the truth we must be honest
[1:31:42] not just with believers but with
[1:31:44] everyone
[1:31:45] amen i trust when people see me or they
[1:31:48] see you they say those people are honest
[1:31:50] they are truthful
[1:31:52] they tell the truth
[1:31:54] amen we want to be tellers of truth
[1:31:56] amen see the devil wants to misconstrue
[1:32:00] the scripture that applies for today
[1:32:03] it's that misconstruing of that part of
[1:32:05] the scripture that applies to the day
[1:32:06] he'll let you know all that jesus did
[1:32:08] was perfectly well he'll let you know
[1:32:09] all that moses did was perfectly well
[1:32:12] but when you take the promise that they
[1:32:13] gave for this day then that was applied
[1:32:15] to another age that's all he has to do
[1:32:17] see is to get the people to believe it
[1:32:19] that way and that's all for you cannot
[1:32:21] take one word away from it or add one
[1:32:23] word to it but that's what he does
[1:32:27] what did he do to eve he misconstrued
[1:32:29] the word for that day
[1:32:31] you know yay hath god said
[1:32:34] so that's all he needs to do now a
[1:32:36] classic one here and and i just took
[1:32:38] some very obvious ones is that people
[1:32:40] say that malachi 4 5 doesn't apply to
[1:32:42] the gentiles
[1:32:44] because malachi 1 1 says the burden of
[1:32:46] the word of the lord to israel by
[1:32:47] malachi
[1:32:49] now
[1:32:50] this is now if you think about that i
[1:32:52] know you've already read the following
[1:32:54] bit so you've already got my answer
[1:32:56] but you see people will take it and say
[1:32:57] oh malach the book of malachi is not
[1:32:59] even for us malachi 4 and 5 behold i
[1:33:02] send you elijah the prophet before the
[1:33:03] great beautiful day of the lord that's
[1:33:04] not for us then because they take that
[1:33:06] one verse but you know if that's true
[1:33:10] without reading the second part
[1:33:12] then the book of ephesians isn't to me
[1:33:15] the book of
[1:33:16] corinthians well i'm not from corinth
[1:33:18] who's from thessalonica who's from
[1:33:20] glacier anyone here
[1:33:22] who's from ephesus
[1:33:25] well i'll just begin to rip that out
[1:33:28] it's not for me no but the apostle paul
[1:33:30] says all scriptures is given by
[1:33:32] inspiration of god and is profitable for
[1:33:35] doctrine for a proof for a correction
[1:33:36] for instruction and righteousness that
[1:33:38] the man of god may be perfect thoroughly
[1:33:40] furnished unto all good works so if a
[1:33:42] spirit ever comes to you and says no the
[1:33:44] book of malachi does not apply to the
[1:33:46] gentiles i'll say hold on all scripture
[1:33:48] is given by inspiration of god amen and
[1:33:50] it's profitable for doctrine so you
[1:33:52] can't just say oh the gospels are for
[1:33:54] teaching and this is for this and you're
[1:33:56] like splitting no no the whole word
[1:33:58] the whole word is profitable see the
[1:34:00] thing is people don't read their bible
[1:34:03] and they'll take one thing that seems so
[1:34:05] true because look it says the burden of
[1:34:06] the word lord israel well that's true
[1:34:09] but they're inferring no that it's not
[1:34:10] for us don't even read that book no all
[1:34:12] scripture is given for doctrine
[1:34:15] amen so i'd rather take what the apostle
[1:34:18] paul said
[1:34:19] than what somewhat some website says
[1:34:23] amen now
[1:34:27] do i have this one
[1:34:29] yes no
[1:34:31] jesus
[1:34:32] well
[1:34:33] let's just read this first
[1:34:35] mark 12 and 6. you know the pharisees
[1:34:37] followed jesus wherever he went
[1:34:39] to try and catch him in his words and
[1:34:41] that catching is like a snaring they
[1:34:43] want to try and catch what it says ah he
[1:34:45] said this or we can use it as a weapon
[1:34:47] and trap him
[1:34:48] that was there
[1:34:49] i feel sorry for people who who fall
[1:34:51] into that lot
[1:34:53] what's my job today follow the messiah
[1:34:55] the very prince of life the one who has
[1:34:58] healed the sick raise the dead cast out
[1:35:00] devils as the is the ransom for the
[1:35:02] whole world just follow and try and
[1:35:03] catch him in what he says
[1:35:06] now david says here in psalms 56
[1:35:09] he says to the chief musician upon
[1:35:12] i'm not going to try and pronounce that
[1:35:14] word
[1:35:15] um
[1:35:16] of david those two words when the
[1:35:18] philistines took him and gath be
[1:35:19] merciful unto me o god for man would
[1:35:22] swallow me up he's he fighting daily
[1:35:25] oppresseth me mine enemies would daily
[1:35:27] swallow me up for they be many that
[1:35:29] fight against me o thou most high what
[1:35:32] time i am afraid
[1:35:34] i will trust in thee and god i'll praise
[1:35:37] his word and god i'll put my trust i'll
[1:35:39] not fear what the flesh can do unto me
[1:35:42] every day they rest my words all their
[1:35:45] thoughts are against me for evil they
[1:35:48] gather themselves together they hide
[1:35:49] themselves they mark my steps when they
[1:35:52] wait for my soul now that word rest is
[1:35:55] actually it's a carving
[1:35:58] it means in the strong's to carve so it
[1:36:00] says they take my words and they chop
[1:36:02] them and they carve them and make them
[1:36:04] say things i'd never said
[1:36:06] this is just like i said with martin
[1:36:08] luther they took things he said and use
[1:36:10] it against you know what they're carving
[1:36:12] his words just taking a part of what he
[1:36:14] said they didn't take his whole ministry
[1:36:16] right
[1:36:18] see now and it's exactly what they've
[1:36:20] done today they take a search program
[1:36:22] they omit and splice
[1:36:24] tapes amen to try and make the prophet
[1:36:27] say things he never said
[1:36:31] he says here and then the next measures
[1:36:32] that um uh uh that opened up the seven
[1:36:35] seals which undone all the hidden
[1:36:37] mysteries of the bible the doctrines and
[1:36:39] so forth which the world so rudely
[1:36:41] attacks nowadays attacks it and says
[1:36:43] it's wrong this that here the other day
[1:36:45] in arizona splicing tapes trying to make
[1:36:47] me say things that i didn't say
[1:36:50] you don't need to physically take the
[1:36:52] tape and cut it here and do this now you
[1:36:53] can just copy paste
[1:36:55] easy but they try and make him say
[1:36:57] things he never said
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:01] but but what is it lies come from an
[1:37:03] agenda
[1:37:04] the devil had an agenda to destroy
[1:37:07] to cause adam and eve to fall
[1:37:09] i mean delilah had an agenda to make
[1:37:12] samson reveal his source of strength
[1:37:14] so it's the same thing lies come from an
[1:37:17] agenda now that agenda could be trying
[1:37:19] to save face
[1:37:20] trying to look better try and make
[1:37:21] yourself better than someone else trying
[1:37:23] to pull someone down that that by virtue
[1:37:25] you'll lift it up that's actually an
[1:37:27] agenda but it's a lie it comes from a
[1:37:29] fallen nature that needs to be dealt
[1:37:31] with
[1:37:33] amen now now here's another one
[1:37:36] if you want azusa street returned i just
[1:37:38] put this in the quote because i because
[1:37:39] i like this i want the power of god like
[1:37:41] never before amen not
[1:37:43] amen they had a genuine move of god and
[1:37:45] god doesn't take away he adds to so he
[1:37:48] took us in the street and then he added
[1:37:49] the opening of the word
[1:37:51] amen if you want azusa street return
[1:37:53] just lay down and be shaved all the way
[1:37:56] down with the word and find out yes sir
[1:37:58] that's the way back to azusa street
[1:38:00] experience is to be shaved off of those
[1:38:02] things
[1:38:03] and he's preaching the lamb and the dove
[1:38:04] i mean it's all malice strife and
[1:38:06] contention let it be shaved off all self
[1:38:08] rights and this is my right and i didn't
[1:38:10] no no let it be shaved off amen i know
[1:38:13] it's a privilege it belongs to you
[1:38:15] because you were born in sin shaped an
[1:38:17] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:38:20] now
[1:38:22] this is actually two scriptures molded
[1:38:23] into one
[1:38:24] and critics will say
[1:38:26] well he's actually just mishmashing
[1:38:28] scripture let's just examine this i'm
[1:38:31] going to come down to our level but you
[1:38:32] know i say lies are a multi
[1:38:34] you know it's against an age it's
[1:38:36] against the ministry it's against
[1:38:37] different things right so people say
[1:38:39] well he's just misquoting the scripture
[1:38:40] now hold on
[1:38:42] let's go here psalms 51. i hope you can
[1:38:44] you can read that i can't read that back
[1:38:46] there he says now have mercy upon me oh
[1:38:49] god well i'll try and find it here
[1:38:51] because actually two things in here
[1:38:53] which are very important
[1:38:56] have mercy upon me o god according to my
[1:38:58] love and kindness according unto the
[1:39:00] multitude of thy tender mercies blot out
[1:39:02] my transgressions now this is after he
[1:39:04] has been exposed by the prophet i think
[1:39:07] it was nathan that he had taken
[1:39:08] bathsheba
[1:39:09] right this is this is this psalm wash me
[1:39:12] thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me
[1:39:13] from cleanse me from my sin for i
[1:39:16] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[1:39:19] is ever before me against thee thee only
[1:39:21] have i sinned and done this evil in my
[1:39:23] sight that thou
[1:39:25] uh might just be justified when thou
[1:39:27] speaketh and be clear without judges
[1:39:29] behold i was shaping iniquity and in sin
[1:39:32] did my mother conceive me now so so the
[1:39:34] reason people speak against brother
[1:39:36] brown putting these two scriptures
[1:39:38] together which we're going to read he's
[1:39:39] saying he he he is misquoting the bible
[1:39:41] therefore changing what it means but
[1:39:43] he's not changing what it means
[1:39:46] so behold i was shaping iniquity so i
[1:39:49] will shape iniquity comfortable speaking
[1:39:50] lies and in sin did my mother conceive
[1:39:52] me behold thou desirest truth in the
[1:39:54] inward parts and the inward parts thou
[1:39:56] shalt make me to know wisdom purge me
[1:39:58] with hossop and i shall be clean wash me
[1:40:00] and i shall be whiter than snow
[1:40:02] make me to hear to hear joy and gladness
[1:40:05] that the bones which thou hath broken
[1:40:07] may rejoice now now the thing is
[1:40:10] people say well this is david's
[1:40:12] experience it doesn't apply to us but
[1:40:14] any really true repentant sinner will
[1:40:17] have the same heart and and feeling and
[1:40:19] expression and you know they'll feel
[1:40:21] exactly the same way david did
[1:40:23] right so so so the critic says well this
[1:40:26] this scripture doesn't apply to us it
[1:40:28] applies to david no well all scripture's
[1:40:29] given for inspiration and who's really
[1:40:32] been repentant and you come to a place
[1:40:34] you say god i'm just wicked i'm lost i'm
[1:40:36] filthy purge me yo i born iniquity i'm
[1:40:38] just lord change me
[1:40:41] so you can experience you're actually
[1:40:43] being in david's shoes
[1:40:45] right but then it says here make and
[1:40:48] and the reason i went down to verse
[1:40:50] eight that the bones which sell has
[1:40:51] broken may rejoice now people i've been
[1:40:54] asked the question years ago where
[1:40:56] brother brahm tells a story of the
[1:40:58] shepherd that has a sheep and the sheep
[1:40:59] just keeps wandering off and then so the
[1:41:01] shepherd breaks its leg
[1:41:03] you know and brings it back and they'd
[1:41:05] say what kind of a god
[1:41:07] would do that kind of a thing
[1:41:09] how you know it's not even that says not
[1:41:11] even scriptural well david because
[1:41:14] remember the reason he went after
[1:41:15] bathsheba is he backslid
[1:41:17] right another spirit came upon he
[1:41:19] actually backs in himself he looked at
[1:41:20] the you know palace window saw bathsheba
[1:41:23] and he committed adultery with her had
[1:41:25] his hus had her husband murdered all
[1:41:27] these things so he was actually straying
[1:41:29] from god
[1:41:30] and so god allowed that all to happen
[1:41:33] right why that the bonjour thou has
[1:41:36] broken may rejoice so so david's
[1:41:38] actually saying all this has befallen me
[1:41:40] their child died all those things
[1:41:42] actually he was actually equating it to
[1:41:43] like his bones had been broken
[1:41:46] right see if we're bible readers we can
[1:41:48] see what brother bram says we can find
[1:41:49] it in the scripture that's why i
[1:41:51] encourage you you listen to brother
[1:41:52] branham take it back into the scripture
[1:41:54] find where amen because he may not say
[1:41:56] specific chapter and verse but but it's
[1:41:58] just scripture he's preaching
[1:42:01] it's actually our job to do that eh
[1:42:03] don't just take my word for it take his
[1:42:05] word take my word and take it back into
[1:42:07] the bible
[1:42:09] and if you're not sure come ask me
[1:42:12] please
[1:42:13] i don't just want you to sit there
[1:42:14] saying uh and you don't even know what's
[1:42:16] going on
[1:42:17] remember it's you and god it's your walk
[1:42:18] with god right
[1:42:20] amen it's my walk with god
[1:42:23] so now we'll go down to psalms 58
[1:42:27] did ye indeed speak righteousness so so
[1:42:30] wait just to keep it in your mind
[1:42:33] i
[1:42:34] oh wait
[1:42:35] sorry
[1:42:37] i'm changing the wrong thing
[1:42:39] shaped inequity come towards speaking
[1:42:41] lies so we've covered the first part of
[1:42:42] that which is from this psalm i shaved
[1:42:45] iniquity right and said did my mother
[1:42:47] conceive me now we go down to psalm 58 i
[1:42:50] trust is not too laborious he says do
[1:42:52] you indeed speak righteousness o
[1:42:53] congregation do we have that up there
[1:42:55] yes you do ye judge uprightly are ye
[1:42:57] sons of men
[1:42:58] yay in heart you work ye work wickedness
[1:43:01] you wave the violence uh of your hands
[1:43:04] in the earth the wicked are estranged
[1:43:06] from the womb they go astray as soon as
[1:43:08] they be born speaking lies their poison
[1:43:11] is like the poison of a serpent they are
[1:43:13] like the death adder that stoppeth her
[1:43:15] ear now some people say but eat
[1:43:18] some people say but the wicked come to
[1:43:20] the world speaking lies i want to ask
[1:43:22] the question do the righteous start off
[1:43:24] righteous
[1:43:26] by our first birth we're all wicked
[1:43:29] that's why we needed a savior that's why
[1:43:31] we needed god himself to become a man to
[1:43:34] purchase our salvation to change our
[1:43:36] nature so because if you take it the
[1:43:39] other way oh there's the righteous they
[1:43:41] are born righteous and the wicked
[1:43:42] they're born wicked that's just how it
[1:43:43] is you're actually diminishing the power
[1:43:45] of the blood
[1:43:47] right you're actually you're actually
[1:43:48] diminishing what he can do we are all
[1:43:50] born in sin
[1:43:52] no one has a free pass to heaven
[1:43:54] just like you know a catholic went to
[1:43:56] brother brown said you know about how
[1:43:58] everyone's shouting and screaming in the
[1:43:59] church and you know i won't go to that
[1:44:00] kind of place you know experience that
[1:44:02] kind of thing and he said well you know
[1:44:04] mary had to scream and shout and act
[1:44:06] like a drunk woman to get to heaven
[1:44:08] because she was in the upper room on the
[1:44:09] day of pentecost she was shouting
[1:44:11] screaming
[1:44:13] babbling stumbling around shouting and
[1:44:14] rejoicing he says you know you need if
[1:44:17] mary if mary who is what we call the
[1:44:19] mother of jesus who bear bore the
[1:44:21] messiah in her womb had to have that
[1:44:23] experience to get to heaven we need it
[1:44:24] too amen
[1:44:27] amen so now
[1:44:30] so we are all wicked
[1:44:32] by our first birth that's why we needed
[1:44:34] a savior
[1:44:36] amen what then for are they better than
[1:44:37] they speaking the jews and gentiles no
[1:44:39] no wise
[1:44:41] for we
[1:44:42] for we have before prove both jews and
[1:44:46] gentiles that they are all under sin as
[1:44:48] it is written there is none righteous no
[1:44:49] not one now
[1:44:51] once again i take what the apostle paul
[1:44:53] says
[1:44:54] i agree with him not my opinion i agree
[1:44:56] with him there is none that understand
[1:44:58] that there is none that seeketh after
[1:44:59] god they've all gone out of the way
[1:45:01] they're all together become unprofitable
[1:45:03] there's none that doeth good no not one
[1:45:05] so remember in god's eyes it's in or out
[1:45:08] saved or lost now we know there's
[1:45:11] different levels of salvation there's
[1:45:13] the bride there's a foolish virgin
[1:45:14] there's 144 000 there's all those kind
[1:45:16] of people but they all end up with
[1:45:18] eternal life
[1:45:19] so they're all so sorry i'm just using
[1:45:21] my terms they're either in or out
[1:45:23] right as is everyone here today yep so
[1:45:26] so what i mean in or out i don't mean
[1:45:28] you're the bride or you're lost no
[1:45:29] that's not how god works god's mercy is
[1:45:31] greater than our little minds can fathom
[1:45:33] right he is the fullest version of being
[1:45:35] looked after right 144 000 are being
[1:45:38] looked after there will be people who
[1:45:39] give cups of water in his name
[1:45:42] jesus said they'll know wise lose their
[1:45:43] reward
[1:45:44] amen so we can't discount those things
[1:45:47] just because we don't understand how it
[1:45:49] works but god said there'll be more
[1:45:50] people brother brahm said you'll be
[1:45:51] surprised who's there
[1:45:54] amen and and i just say that's wonderful
[1:45:57] hallelujah if i saw all of my work
[1:45:59] colleagues all my family
[1:46:02] all my friends
[1:46:03] everyone i knew at school everyone i
[1:46:05] ever knew in heaven i'd be happy about
[1:46:07] that
[1:46:08] wouldn't you be happy
[1:46:09] even your worst enemy absolutely i'd
[1:46:12] rather than there than not
[1:46:14] amen that's just how i feel like
[1:46:16] everyone come let's just empty the whole
[1:46:17] earth and just all gotten a rapture just
[1:46:20] leave the devil here get burned up you
[1:46:21] know but just take everyone amen into
[1:46:24] heaven that's how i feel amen so there
[1:46:27] their throat is an open sepulchre with
[1:46:29] their tongues have they used to seek the
[1:46:31] poison of asps is under their lips whose
[1:46:33] mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
[1:46:35] their feet are swift to shed blood now
[1:46:37] remember to shed blood these days it's
[1:46:39] just you murder someone's character it's
[1:46:41] not always a literal shedding of blood
[1:46:42] you can kill someone's influence by
[1:46:44] murdering their character i mean how do
[1:46:46] you do that by telling lies it can be a
[1:46:48] white lie but you push them down you're
[1:46:50] actually ultimately murdering their
[1:46:51] character i mean their destruction the
[1:46:55] destruction and misery are in their ways
[1:46:57] the way of peace they have not known
[1:46:59] there is no fear of god before their
[1:47:00] eyes now this is not just all that's
[1:47:02] unbelievers no no that can be message
[1:47:04] people
[1:47:05] right where the way of peace they have
[1:47:06] not known if you want to have if if you
[1:47:09] can't be happy unless you're fighting
[1:47:10] someone or have a fuss against someone
[1:47:12] you do not know the way of peace maybe
[1:47:14] we should want to be living peaceably
[1:47:16] with all men irrespective of it's our
[1:47:18] greatest enemy our bitterest rival
[1:47:20] whatever they are there should be such a
[1:47:22] love of god in your heart for them you
[1:47:24] don't want to start a fuss you don't
[1:47:26] want to continue or fast you know like
[1:47:28] the english and the french they fought
[1:47:30] the 100 year war
[1:47:32] let it go man
[1:47:34] they couldn't let it go i don't want to
[1:47:36] find a 100 year war
[1:47:39] amen just
[1:47:41] you know but that's how people want to
[1:47:43] be
[1:47:44] oh if it's not this brother is this
[1:47:45] sister not this sister this brother not
[1:47:47] this family is that family not this
[1:47:48] church is this church not this preacher
[1:47:50] that preacher they've got to fight
[1:47:51] someone fight the devil
[1:47:54] how do you do that you live a
[1:47:55] consecrated life and you love the lord
[1:47:57] with all your heart and you praise him
[1:47:59] and worship just tell him how good he is
[1:48:00] all day amen that's the thunder that
[1:48:02] shakes the devil
[1:48:04] i mean so we have an enemy
[1:48:06] sure we can disagree we're allowed to
[1:48:08] disagree you know what just like even
[1:48:09] the natural family you can disagree
[1:48:12] right about things i like sweet food not
[1:48:15] everyone likes sweet food i still eat
[1:48:17] savory because well i just eat anything
[1:48:19] but you know i prefer sweet food
[1:48:21] but just because you don't like sweet
[1:48:22] food doesn't mean we can't have be
[1:48:24] friends
[1:48:26] you say that's ridiculous well
[1:48:28] ultimately if there's a fuss going on
[1:48:30] between they're all ridiculous
[1:48:32] let's not you know let's be let's be men
[1:48:34] and women
[1:48:36] the world is coming to an end
[1:48:38] do you want your last moments on the
[1:48:39] earth to be remembered as a fuss and a
[1:48:40] fight no i want my last moment so i want
[1:48:43] to live for you lord jesus
[1:48:45] amen
[1:48:49] why do people lie now this is from
[1:48:51] this website
[1:48:53] yeah uh and and silvas.com you look at
[1:48:55] lies and you know it's amazing people
[1:48:57] say there's like four different colors
[1:48:58] of lies and no they're just all black
[1:49:01] or they're all i mean they're just all
[1:49:03] lies whatever color you want to put to
[1:49:04] it it's all that color
[1:49:05] but it's not good and bad or
[1:49:08] horrible whatever no no they're actually
[1:49:09] and god's eyes are all the same we may
[1:49:11] say them as see you in a in a in a
[1:49:14] variety or whatever was good and bad
[1:49:16] whatever spectrum but no no lies are
[1:49:18] lies so why do people lie they cover
[1:49:20] their tracks
[1:49:22] to create an illusion
[1:49:24] to distract from reality now i just want
[1:49:26] to say this i'm just going to take it
[1:49:27] this one way
[1:49:28] if you're hurting
[1:49:30] if you're really hurting
[1:49:33] don't just hold it in
[1:49:35] if you're in pain
[1:49:37] don't just hold it in if you're troubled
[1:49:39] don't just hold it in
[1:49:41] god wants to take it from you who wants
[1:49:43] to bring healing
[1:49:44] we don't we're not called to walk in
[1:49:46] these doors and put on a face and you
[1:49:48] know sometimes everything's not okay
[1:49:50] and it's actually okay when it's not
[1:49:52] okay because the lord can fix it
[1:49:54] but if we hold it and say no
[1:49:56] everything's fine though there will come
[1:49:57] a breaking point somewhere i would
[1:49:59] rather the breaking point be the devil
[1:50:01] is defeated as opposed to me breaking
[1:50:04] right so if you're hurting see god
[1:50:05] doesn't push us in the corner because
[1:50:07] we're hurting he what he's come to bind
[1:50:10] up the brokenhearted set at liberty them
[1:50:12] that are bruised so if you're bruised in
[1:50:14] your spirit and you're telling lies or
[1:50:16] trouble it because of a bruise he wants
[1:50:18] to set you free from that
[1:50:20] right we are not perfect people
[1:50:22] amen i'm not a perfect person i'm still
[1:50:25] a person i'm looking for a body change
[1:50:27] i'm going to rejoice and the more i
[1:50:29] spend on this earth the happier i'm
[1:50:30] going to be not because i'm aging
[1:50:32] necessarily but i just want to be free
[1:50:34] from myself
[1:50:36] i mean so you know if you're hurting if
[1:50:37] you're in pain there's healing for that
[1:50:40] there is in the in the blood of jesus
[1:50:42] christ there's a healing and we are not
[1:50:44] here to condemn anyone whatever you've
[1:50:46] been in or in right now you've tripped
[1:50:48] and fallen to something
[1:50:50] we don't push anyone down you don't have
[1:50:52] to sit in the back and do a probation
[1:50:54] nonsense no no just come to jesus
[1:50:56] so if you're so don't live under the lie
[1:50:59] that everything's fine when it's not
[1:51:01] okay
[1:51:02] right we don't have to remember a sheep
[1:51:04] is not a beast of burden
[1:51:06] it's not built to carry who's seen a
[1:51:08] sheep carrying a big pack on his back
[1:51:09] and being led by you don't see it
[1:51:11] because they're not physically built
[1:51:14] they're not a camel they're not a horse
[1:51:16] they're not an oxen they're not built
[1:51:17] that way
[1:51:19] they are not a beast of burden and we
[1:51:21] are not called to be because we're
[1:51:22] sheeping
[1:51:23] we're not called to be beasts of burden
[1:51:25] to carry pain and hurt and resentment
[1:51:28] and trouble and all that no we don't
[1:51:30] have to carry it
[1:51:31] well you could say actually the only
[1:51:33] place we're called to carrot is to the
[1:51:34] lord
[1:51:35] cast your cares upon him because he
[1:51:37] cares for you
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:41] you know to make themselves look good or
[1:51:44] someone else look bad that's a lie
[1:51:46] you know to gain sympathy or or
[1:51:49] advantage you know it can be very hard
[1:51:51] when you talk to certain people and you
[1:51:53] don't know if they're telling you the
[1:51:54] truth or not because they twist things
[1:51:56] even just a little bit and they
[1:51:58] emphasize certain points and they make
[1:51:59] it look way bigger and it's hard are
[1:52:01] they really telling me the truth or do i
[1:52:03] have to kind of weave or maybe lean
[1:52:06] a certain way to bring it to the middle
[1:52:07] now that's very hard to do
[1:52:10] we're not called to be those kind of
[1:52:11] people we just tell the truth
[1:52:15] alter another
[1:52:16] person's perception of the situation
[1:52:19] to give false impressions
[1:52:21] to other people about themselves or
[1:52:23] someone else
[1:52:25] this person did this oh here they go
[1:52:27] again just offhand comments to try and
[1:52:29] rubbish people down those are lies we're
[1:52:30] here to build one another up
[1:52:32] i want to see everyone in heaven
[1:52:35] i want to see you all there
[1:52:38] and if everyone at church on youtube
[1:52:40] land i want to see you all there
[1:52:43] right there's not a single person and
[1:52:45] now this is from my heart there's not a
[1:52:46] single person i know have known that i
[1:52:48] don't want to see in heaven
[1:52:50] i want to see everyone there
[1:52:52] and that's how we should be
[1:52:55] so we don't want to tell what we call
[1:52:57] white lies
[1:52:59] to gain advantage or to get sympathy
[1:53:01] sure if we're hurting we're hurting
[1:53:03] going through a rough patch we'll go
[1:53:04] through rough patches but the body's
[1:53:06] here to help one another
[1:53:08] amen and the lord is here to bring the
[1:53:10] strength
[1:53:12] hallelujah
[1:53:14] amen but these are all people will lie
[1:53:16] for their cause like i said the nazis
[1:53:18] lied for their cause well that's very
[1:53:19] obvious people want to destroy the
[1:53:21] message they tell lies for their cause
[1:53:24] right see because remember the tactic of
[1:53:26] the enemy is to try and put enough doubt
[1:53:29] on upon the word of god to make you
[1:53:30] disbelieve it just like i said about the
[1:53:32] apostle paul this whole movement they
[1:53:33] want to try and destroy his ministry the
[1:53:35] bible has been translated so many times
[1:53:37] how can you prove it if god is his word
[1:53:39] he will keep it pure
[1:53:42] amen amen
[1:53:44] so we don't want to
[1:53:47] we don't want to but bc the reason
[1:53:49] people lie is because that iniquity that
[1:53:52] was in the devil
[1:53:54] in heaven has come down into them
[1:53:58] by their first birth or by a bruise
[1:54:01] lord jesus just cleanse us out now
[1:54:04] i don't want i have no part in him and i
[1:54:07] want no part of him and me
[1:54:09] amen
[1:54:14] proverbs 26 we're gonna
[1:54:16] wind up soon
[1:54:17] he says now where no wooders
[1:54:20] they're the fire garth out
[1:54:22] so where there is no tail bearer the
[1:54:24] strife sees us
[1:54:26] as coals are to
[1:54:28] as coals are to burning coals and wood
[1:54:30] to fire so is a contentious man that
[1:54:33] kindles strife
[1:54:34] the words of a tail bearer are as wounds
[1:54:36] they go down into the innermost part of
[1:54:38] the belly now that word talbera means it
[1:54:41] so so to roll to pieces a slanderer a
[1:54:44] tail bearer a whisperer
[1:54:46] so when that spirit is not there's no
[1:54:48] more strife
[1:54:51] right i say if you
[1:54:53] if all your relationships are trouble
[1:54:55] then maybe there's a common denominator
[1:54:58] in that situation that's you
[1:55:00] if you have peace with everyone
[1:55:02] there's a common denominator that's you
[1:55:05] and the reason you're one or the others
[1:55:07] because of the grace of god's come into
[1:55:08] your life
[1:55:09] amen and taking those things out
[1:55:13] now
[1:55:14] you can start see a tale bearer can seem
[1:55:16] so innocent
[1:55:17] but it says wounds have gone to the
[1:55:18] innermost part of the belly
[1:55:20] now on the other end of the spectrum
[1:55:22] this is a human spectrum
[1:55:24] there are people who come under a strong
[1:55:26] delusion
[1:55:28] and so with all this evilness of
[1:55:30] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:55:32] because they receive not a love for the
[1:55:34] truth
[1:55:35] i pray that we have a love for the truth
[1:55:38] amen we love this
[1:55:40] amen we love his word amen we have a
[1:55:42] love for it not just receiving the truth
[1:55:44] but a love for the truth if you don't
[1:55:46] have a love for the truth you say lord
[1:55:48] jesus i want to love your word
[1:55:50] may i receive a love for the truth that
[1:55:51] they might be saved and for this course
[1:55:53] god shall send them a strong delusion
[1:55:55] what's the cause they don't receive a
[1:55:57] love for the truth i mean they should
[1:55:59] believe a lie and that they all might be
[1:56:01] damned who believe not the truth but
[1:56:03] have pleasure in unrighteousness
[1:56:05] amen so we i pray none of us have
[1:56:08] pleasure in seeing people being torn
[1:56:09] down
[1:56:13] so that to me so a strong delusion
[1:56:15] what's that that's a very strong cause
[1:56:17] in their own mind and they'll do all
[1:56:19] that they can that that strong delusion
[1:56:20] is projected
[1:56:22] lord jesus help us
[1:56:24] but we understand this that see it says
[1:56:26] yey and all that live godly in christ
[1:56:28] jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:56:31] but no evil but but evil men and
[1:56:33] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[1:56:35] deceiving and being deceived just like
[1:56:37] the devil he was deceived by his own
[1:56:39] iniquity
[1:56:40] and then he started deceiving
[1:56:42] and he's still deceived today
[1:56:44] see that same attribute is coming to man
[1:56:47] but we are called not to have that in us
[1:56:50] amen that's why the lord jesus came to
[1:56:52] cleanse us of all unrighteousness amen
[1:56:54] that we would be free see the effects of
[1:56:57] lies are very powerful
[1:56:59] brother branham would um you could
[1:57:00] actually see it in the film 20th century
[1:57:02] prophet there's a woman that comes up to
[1:57:03] him in the prayer line that's the you
[1:57:04] know there's the 10 minutes where he's
[1:57:06] interviewed by the brothers there and
[1:57:08] then there's a chicago campaign a video
[1:57:10] 10 minutes as well and there's a woman
[1:57:12] comes up before him
[1:57:15] and and and as a prayer line and this is
[1:57:17] what goes on and you can see the
[1:57:19] expression on her face she starts
[1:57:20] breaking down and crying so this liar's
[1:57:22] had a great impact on her life excuse me
[1:57:24] sister have to relax my mind once in a
[1:57:26] while because he just spoken to someone
[1:57:28] else now we be strangers i see that
[1:57:30] you're strictly a stranger to me you're
[1:57:32] away from here you come from another
[1:57:34] city you've got a lot of trouble on your
[1:57:35] heart and you've got heart trouble to
[1:57:37] begin with is that right there's a whole
[1:57:39] lot of blackness i see a black sheep
[1:57:41] keep following you like that oh it's a
[1:57:43] lie
[1:57:44] somebody's told a lie on you and that
[1:57:47] was a man that was professing divine
[1:57:49] healing the sister says yes sir and you
[1:57:51] can see it in the film and you can hear
[1:57:52] it he said you was a witch
[1:57:55] yes is that true and you got a whole
[1:57:57] stir in your church or something about
[1:57:59] it isn't that right
[1:58:01] and your pastor's sick right now he's
[1:58:02] got polio is that right yes sir sister
[1:58:05] don't pay no attention to what their
[1:58:06] people tell you they're lying the only
[1:58:08] thing that's wrong with your heart is a
[1:58:10] nervous condition got your heart worked
[1:58:12] up go home in peace and god bless you
[1:58:14] you're all right god bless you you're
[1:58:16] not a witch i mean to that lie that was
[1:58:18] told on who made her get heart trouble
[1:58:20] get troubled and stir and then a whole
[1:58:22] church was stirred up why because a
[1:58:24] minister said oh she's a witch and now
[1:58:26] everyone else was believing that lie it
[1:58:27] caused trouble in the church i mean but
[1:58:29] it was just a lie
[1:58:31] that was told upon her from someone in
[1:58:34] authority and it made her have this
[1:58:36] trouble and things because just a lie
[1:58:38] was told
[1:58:40] because the devil told her through that
[1:58:43] preacher that she was a witch but she is
[1:58:45] a genuine sincere believer and that's
[1:58:48] why it troubled her this in my opinion
[1:58:50] it troubled her so much because i
[1:58:52] believe we're all sincere people we want
[1:58:53] to be right with god
[1:58:55] amen that's why we've given our lives to
[1:58:57] him that's why i want to serve him
[1:58:58] because we love him and we want to
[1:58:59] please him and because he's so wonderful
[1:59:01] he you know and so so if someone would
[1:59:03] come against you and say no you're a
[1:59:05] witch
[1:59:06] look at you you do this and you're wrong
[1:59:08] here and because of your sincerity you
[1:59:09] get all troubled about it
[1:59:11] and see this lie had such an impact on
[1:59:14] her life it was physically manifesting
[1:59:16] in her body
[1:59:17] amen but the spirit of truth came
[1:59:20] and told her no no that's just a lie
[1:59:22] that's been told upon you but see she
[1:59:24] was believing that lie up until that
[1:59:25] point and it was troubling her whole
[1:59:27] life and there's a thing with a lie if
[1:59:30] it can influences in that way it can
[1:59:32] trouble our whole life
[1:59:34] that's why i pray lord jesus may your
[1:59:36] spirit the spirit of truth come amen and
[1:59:39] expose all lies
[1:59:41] all things that hold over us amen that
[1:59:43] we can walk free
[1:59:45] hallelujah
[1:59:47] amen see you're not a witch see you're
[1:59:50] all right god bless you you're not a
[1:59:52] witch she walked out there happy and
[1:59:54] rejoicing
[1:59:55] amen but you see the devil tries to live
[1:59:57] us up make us live under a lie
[2:00:00] amen you'll never be free
[2:00:02] you'll never really receive the holy
[2:00:04] ghost this is not for you you'll never
[2:00:06] be healed you just have to put up with
[2:00:08] this problem you just got to live with
[2:00:10] this this is just how you've got to live
[2:00:12] from now on see he wants to want you to
[2:00:13] live under a lie you're not really going
[2:00:15] to go to heaven the rapture is really
[2:00:17] not for you you're never going to make
[2:00:18] it you're not good enough you're never
[2:00:20] going to achieve you know all those
[2:00:21] things he tries to make us live and your
[2:00:23] family is not going to be saved your
[2:00:25] loved ones are never coming in this is
[2:00:27] never going to happen and see if see if
[2:00:29] that can
[2:00:30] if that can influence us it can make us
[2:00:32] actually physically start to be stressed
[2:00:34] we can get heart conditions out of fear
[2:00:36] and worry why because a lie has come
[2:00:38] into our lives but we need to look into
[2:00:40] the spirit of truth and say lord what
[2:00:43] have you said in your word because your
[2:00:45] word is ye and amen your word is true

[2:05:39] word then you are my disciples indeed
[2:05:41] and you shall know the truth and the
[2:05:43] truth shall make you free they answered

[2:05:47] bondage to any man how sayeth thou ye
[2:05:50] shall be made free jesus saith unto them
[2:05:52] verily will i send you whosoever
[2:05:54] committeth sin is the servant of sin and
[2:05:56] the servant abideth not in the house
[2:05:58] forever
[2:05:59] pardon me but the son abideth ever if
[2:06:01] the son therefore shall make you free ye
[2:06:03] shall be free indeed

[2:06:32] free you shall be free indeed amen not
[2:06:35] just partially free you'll be free
[2:06:37] indeed
[2:06:38] hallelujah
[2:06:40] amen praise god i'm so glad
[2:06:42] i'm so glad sure
[2:06:44] there's lies
[2:06:46] the devil's a father of lies
[2:06:48] we don't but the believer has no part
[2:06:52] in that
[2:06:53] we may be born
[2:06:55] you know with that attributedness of of
[2:06:57] being a liar right
[2:06:59] but there comes a time in our christian
[2:07:01] walk where god kills it
[2:07:04] amen where where the holy ghost can
[2:07:06] actually you you begin to say a lie he
[2:07:08] said no hold on sorry that was wrong
[2:07:10] i didn't mean to say that and you put
[2:07:12] things right see the holy ghost should
[2:07:14] actually tell you the lord himself shall
[2:07:15] tell you no no you shouldn't do that you
[2:07:16] shouldn't have done that make that right
[2:07:18] amen and you go yes sorry
[2:07:20] and you make it right that's how it
[2:07:22] should be
[2:07:24] because we have no part in the devil and
[2:07:26] devil has no part in us
[2:07:30] but if you find yourself in that way
[2:07:33] the blood is here
[2:07:35] to take that lying spirit away
[2:07:37] take that bruise away
[2:07:39] amen because what i love about the new
[2:07:41] birth is god can just he just takes it
[2:07:44] all out everything that's of the devil
[2:07:46] he just takes it out
[2:07:47] hallelujah
[2:07:49] amen and and as you keep walking with
[2:07:50] the lord maybe you find something comes
[2:07:52] up again
[2:07:53] or buried there you know it begins to
[2:07:55] grow the lord allows things you know
[2:07:57] what you know weeds you can't pluck out
[2:07:59] weeds if there's still seeds in the soil
[2:08:01] who's tried to do that i haven't tried
[2:08:02] to do that i don't think any gardener
[2:08:04] does that but it's when it's when the
[2:08:06] weeds come out then they're pulled out
[2:08:08] it's the same thing with us we have
[2:08:10] things buried in our spirit and our
[2:08:11] nature but when the sunlight begins to
[2:08:14] fall the holy ghost amen the water of
[2:08:16] the word washes it doesn't just bring
[2:08:18] you know bring the wheat out it brings
[2:08:20] weeds out
[2:08:21] but the reason and us that happens is
[2:08:23] because the lord wants it plucked out so
[2:08:25] when you see you may tell a bear face
[2:08:26] lie you may be shocked to say oh god i
[2:08:28] can't believe i did that what's that
[2:08:29] it's a weed come out
[2:08:31] and the reason that it actually comes
[2:08:32] out is god knows it's in you but he
[2:08:34] wants it out of you and the only reason
[2:08:36] the only way it can come out is when you
[2:08:37] say lord take this from me and he takes
[2:08:40] it from you he doesn't pin you down and
[2:08:42] pull everything out of you no no it's
[2:08:43] out of a willing heart we say lord take
[2:08:45] it all from me
[2:08:46] amen we have the musicians please this
[2:08:48] morning i'm so glad amen
[2:08:54] the spirit of truth
