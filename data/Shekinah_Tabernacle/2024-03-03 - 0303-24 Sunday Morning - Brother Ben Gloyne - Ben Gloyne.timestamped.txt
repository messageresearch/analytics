[38:30] first time for me to go uml just a bit
[38:34] of geography uh here's the Sol oh maybe
[38:36] can I have the pointer actually I
[38:38] probably need to throw a laser up there
[38:39] but here's here's a map of the Solomon
[38:41] Islands uh so the red places where we
[38:44] went so hanara the capital we went up to
[38:47] uh Munda to noro and then up that top
[38:49] one is is wi so the three places we went
[38:52] to Brother Jim cman is still okay um
[38:54] he's still there he's there till the 11
[38:56] 11th of March so if you think I was away
[38:58] for a long time he's been he's going to
[39:00] be away for a very long time but he
[39:01] hasn't been there for 3 years because of
[39:03] Co and different things so uh he wanted
[39:06] to reconnect with the Believers and so
[39:08] on people that he know so um so this is
[39:10] just the first part of the trip so went
[39:12] to noro there's a lot of travel by boat
[39:14] uh here's the town here we stayed we
[39:16] stayed in the town noro these places are
[39:18] some of the places we went administered
[39:20] so for example we took a there's no
[39:22] really road that goes here very well so
[39:24] you take a boat everywhere wow so I've
[39:26] had my boating for for a couple of years
[39:29] um but we went up here there was so when
[39:31] we first landed in nto there was a uh a
[39:34] a uh uh woman came along says can you
[39:37] please come pray for my husband he's got
[39:39] bad asthma and he's got a problems with
[39:41] his legs now we didn't know she lived
[39:42] all the way up here so we took a boat up
[39:44] here went through the jungle for I don't
[39:46] know how long few kilometers and then so
[39:48] we prayed for this man and and he could
[39:50] breathe a lot better um he had swelling
[39:52] in his legs water retention in his legs
[39:54] because of some medicine the Hospital
[39:56] gave to him but he was more mobile and a
[39:58] lot better so um we went here this is
[40:01] where we had church on Sunday lamboo Bay
[40:03] this probably doesn't mean a lot to
[40:03] anyone but um we had Church there then
[40:06] we went up to a village here
[40:09] me Jesus how Sav him life belong me and
[40:13] uh to the church there so I shared my
[40:14] testimony and P I spoke a lot of pigeon
[40:16] there it was like English was in h then
[40:18] I just went into pigeon after that and
[40:20] everyone said clear me talk BL you so it
[40:22] was clear people understood um because
[40:24] the pigeon's a lot more English than it
[40:26] is and Pap when um yeah so we shared
[40:29] testimony up there and then um and and
[40:31] the pastor and four others gave their
[40:33] life to the Lord so so so there's open
[40:36] doors around the place amen but this
[40:40] this happened everywhere I was like I
[40:42] started if I go back to hodara yeah I
[40:44] preached there about how God's word will
[40:46] not return to him void but will
[40:48] accomplish that which he purpos it to do
[40:49] I just shared testimony after testimony
[40:51] of this message works this message is
[40:54] not Doctrine just or just church no this
[40:56] is God this is Jesus Christ revealed and
[40:59] pretty much the whole church came up for
[41:00] prayer kids with drug addiction problems
[41:03] all kinds of things people and God
[41:04] touched many lives amen so you know we
[41:07] know know story true talk Bel God it be
[41:11] real okay God's word is it's not just
[41:14] stories it's not just testimonies of a
[41:16] prophet of of the Prophet messenger for
[41:18] the age no God is the same today as he
[41:20] was amen so praise the Lord so yeah we
[41:23] went over here yeah we went different
[41:25] places and witnessed and shared and
[41:27] because the message is very very new a
[41:30] lot of people are it's only just
[41:31] starting to people are starting just to
[41:34] catch it you know it Grieves you so much
[41:35] there's so many hungry Souls but there's
[41:37] no Shepherds they're just scattered
[41:39] they're just trying to you know and it
[41:42] gave me a great burden for people so
[41:44] Lord help us to find ministers there
[41:46] that you can set a flame and then you
[41:48] can establish churches and ground people
[41:50] in the present truth and okay and then
[41:53] oh this is probably video you turn off
[41:54] this is not all there this is just an
[41:56] idea see there's the Waterway there uh
[41:58] there's tuna boats
[42:00] coming uh this is just how it is so very
[42:02] um it's not glamorous lovely place but
[42:05] you know hey this is not a I go camping
[42:07] but just not in New Zealand I'll put it
[42:09] that way um so yeah that's not okay we
[42:11] come to you do you want to put the sound
[42:13] up this is this is church on Sunday in
[42:16] AO this brother here brother William um
[42:20] you can probably I know you want to meet
[42:22] that
[42:22] again anyway so it's just a house
[42:25] meeting this brother here his brother is
[42:26] a deacon in a uniting church another
[42:29] part of the place we had we stayed in
[42:31] his house we had a real good Fellowship
[42:33] really just sharing how you in the word
[42:35] of God the message of the hour how God
[42:37] is real to that because he's a real
[42:39] leader see it's amazing when you think
[42:41] about it how the Bible says that like
[42:43] when Jesus when he after he came out of
[42:45] the Wilderness he went to the land of
[42:47] zeel and nle that it might be fulfilled
[42:49] people that sat in great Darkness beheld
[42:51] great light so you think about it here
[42:53] people are living they got families
[42:55] they've got Church they've got religion
[42:57] all kinds of things but they're sitting
[42:58] in darkness because the light of the
[43:00] word has never come across their path
[43:02] that really impacts me when I look at
[43:04] all this multitude of people round about
[43:06] living life just like in jesus' time but
[43:08] sitting in Gross Darkness that's why
[43:10] Lord may this word live may they see
[43:12] it's more than religion they've got
[43:13] they're up to hear in
[43:15] religion but may they see life changing
[43:19] the word changes lives amen so oh I
[43:22] should actually see right here me okay
[43:23] then we went from there uh we went to Wi
[43:28] now wagina is a um this is where they do
[43:30] seaweed farming so we landed in a strip
[43:32] here which is on a small island see the
[43:34] whole island is the air strip we went by
[43:36] a boat all the way down here we went to
[43:38] we stayed in here so these people this
[43:41] part of the country it's actually not um
[43:44] they're all from kabati if you know
[43:46] where kabati is lots of small atoles but
[43:48] the British in the 50s they they they
[43:50] moved they bought this part of the
[43:52] country or something and they gave it to
[43:54] them because kurab small atal small
[43:56] Islands they became overpopulated so so
[43:59] these people aren't even you could say
[44:00] Solomon Islanders so you can see they
[44:02] look different when we see so yes so we
[44:04] did a lot of um so yeah so we so this
[44:07] just enlarged part of here just quickly
[44:09] just so you get a bit of an idea so we
[44:11] stayed on this island it's all it's all
[44:13] Huts name belong Island
[44:17] Benjamin Place belong me this is my
[44:20] place and then we had Church on this
[44:22] island that's true and then we stay
[44:24] there's all this big um um Mangrove
[44:27] Mazes of mangroves now I'll show you
[44:30] later but um there's oh yeah so this is
[44:34] where we stayed this all seaweed Farms
[44:36] low tide they harvest seaweed they plant
[44:38] it and it's it's very good money um for
[44:41] them so where are we now do you want to
[44:42] okay so we're going to church this is us
[44:44] going to church on Sunday that's a nice
[44:46] that's a nice way to go to church isn't
[44:48] it um but if it's blowing a gale and
[44:51] it's pouring down with rain maybe a
[44:53] different picture we're going to church
[44:55] church is over here okay so we're going
[44:56] to church um
[44:59] maybe yes you going to put the sound up
[45:01] this is us having church this is brother
[45:03] ataki he is the pastor he's the leader
[45:06] there um brother Jim met him six years
[45:09] ago hasn't been able to be in contact
[45:11] with him until until now um but yeah I
[45:15] know these um so this place is a
[45:17] Catholic stronghold the island we stand
[45:19] on is a Catholic Island and you see
[45:21] religious
[45:23] Spirits you don't play games they really
[45:26] do do persecute and cause trouble
[45:27] there's a very fine line they've got to
[45:30] you know but of course they're not a lot
[45:31] of these people are from the United
[45:33] Church they come out of Methodist or
[45:34] they're still you know in that way but
[45:36] Protestant people okay they're singing
[45:38] in kabar I think G gilberties okay so we
[45:41] go this is this is the view after church
[45:43] this is where we stayed nice view of a
[45:46] fellowship Paul I just wanted to put
[45:47] that
[45:48] in but yeah but it's uh yes anyway okay
[45:52] so so here's the view from Benjamin
[45:54] Island this is where we stayed now it
[45:57] may look very tropical but when you got
[45:59] rats running through the rafters at
[46:00] night you got to dust all the ants off
[46:02] your bed you got a mosquito net you know
[46:04] it's not too glamorous but one
[46:05] outstanding thing that really that
[46:07] really happened here is it was Monday
[46:09] morning and I woke up to this unearthly
[46:12] scream it was more it was a teenage girl
[46:15] the scream but it wasn't a human scream
[46:17] and so brother Jim was downstairs he was
[46:20] praying and talking to people I just
[46:22] heard go get Ben so I went downstairs
[46:24] there's this demon-possessed teenager
[46:26] and I felt like I was back at Camp again
[46:28] and then this this girl I asked him what
[46:30] name name belong you and she said name
[46:31] belong me Satan screaming and just
[46:33] writhing and screaming and you know
[46:35] Satan on the throne just just screaming
[46:37] and so I started praying for her and she
[46:40] and she passed out thought well I've
[46:41] seen this before and I explained to
[46:42] brother Jim this is what happens when
[46:44] the spirit's about to be cast out or
[46:45] make the person pass out so so it won't
[46:48] be free so person W be free so I um we
[46:52] youo y we kept praying cuz he asked you
[46:54] know does this only come out by prayer
[46:56] or fasting I said no I've seen this
[46:57] before he was singing Papa New Guinea I
[46:59] said no this is New Zealand I've seen
[47:00] this and so I so so we kept praying for
[47:03] her she she she came to she was still
[47:05] screaming and yelling and totally beside
[47:07] us out of her mind completely couldn't
[47:09] even look in the eye just saw the white
[47:10] of her eyes and I thought Lord what can
[47:13] we do then and then as soon as I asked I
[47:16] felt such a love and compassion come
[47:17] over me I thought this is just another
[47:20] Soul Jesus died for her like she did
[47:23] like he did for me no difference and
[47:25] then God cast that Spirit out she went
[47:27] from demon possessed to S sound mind
[47:30] sitting still answering questions
[47:32] Talking I asked you is is Jesus Emy boss
[47:35] man yes Jesus on the throne yes and she
[47:38] she actually got dragged here by two
[47:41] women carrying her cuz she's so demon
[47:43] possessed but after prayer and then then
[47:45] after she was just sitting there still I
[47:46] said I want to pray for you just prayed
[47:47] for a committed her to the Lord and she
[47:49] walked home normal amen God I said look
[47:52] you need rest you need something to eat
[47:57] she left normal so even it was just for
[47:59] her God gave her another
[48:02] chance then me we we we had a service I
[48:05] don't have any video here but we had a
[48:07] service here of um in the Catholic
[48:10] Church there's about 4050 especially
[48:12] young people and I just shared my
[48:14] testimony in Pigeon and they you see
[48:17] whenever I meet talk pigeon and they had
[48:19] him talk belong me and they all Focus
[48:20] him no move him no talk him they they
[48:22] had him talk belong me they all focused
[48:24] because it was very clear and God began
[48:26] to deal with people we had about 20 20
[48:29] people come for prayer after that some
[48:31] with sickness they got healed there's
[48:32] one sister said I've got this big pain
[48:34] in my side can you pray for me prayed
[48:36] for her went off happy next morning I
[48:38] said how are you she I'm fine you know
[48:40] headache's gone different things gone
[48:42] people gave their lives to the Lord why
[48:44] because the power of a testimony not my
[48:47] testimony God's testimony I mean this
[48:49] message works if you don't you if if
[48:51] it's the last thing you ever hear me say
[48:53] this message works it will accomplish
[48:56] that which is purposed to do don't let
[48:58] the devil ever put it down your
[48:59] spiritual throat that it doesn't work it
[49:01] it's not for you it's for you God is
[49:03] without respector of persons God is the
[49:05] same you just take him at his word and
[49:07] you watch God do what he wants to do
[49:10] hallelujah amen so we had a very good
[49:12] time there just that but talking to
[49:14] brother ataki if I can find let's go the
[49:16] next one so as I was Sayang about the
[49:18] mangrove um Mangrove jungle so I mean
[49:21] maze so what he has done is he is he
[49:24] found this piece of land so over there
[49:25] most of the island is uninhabited so you
[49:28] can go you can build a house and the
[49:29] government will give you three hectares
[49:31] around the house so he's done that this
[49:32] is this is the back of nowhere I was
[49:34] like where are we going in this boats
[49:36] narrow and mangroves and anyway so he's
[49:38] built a church here because he wants to
[49:40] build a place safe that his people can
[49:42] build homes and they're free from
[49:44] persecution they're free from religious
[49:46] persecution so they've been building
[49:48] this church for 3 years he's got a house
[49:50] uh further in the jungle uh from here
[49:53] and um and a couple other Brethren have
[49:55] built houses around it but they still
[49:56] had their house on the island so they've
[49:58] got their workplace their holiday house
[50:00] and their Island House you know you know
[50:03] so this is this is what it's like so so
[50:06] this is our we're going through the
[50:08] mangroves deep just everywhere but but
[50:10] he's built this I thought this brother's
[50:12] got foresight he's got a vision you know
[50:15] he's not just reactive and no he wants
[50:17] to build have a long-term plan for his
[50:19] people in his family I mean that God can
[50:22] God can be there um you know they can
[50:24] have a safe place This Is Us going
[50:26] through the jungle this is what this is
[50:27] part of his garden of his house but we
[50:29] had to walk over this is all actually
[50:31] you could say virgin Forest never been
[50:33] touched before and um you know all the
[50:36] tall stuff and yeah this is Brother Jim
[50:37] you see he's not he's not lagging on
[50:39] behind he's pressing on you know and uh
[50:41] we had to walk over logs and all kinds
[50:43] of things but it was really amazing so
[50:46] um now this is this is so this is
[50:49] Brother ataki here okay so his wife here
[50:52] I can't remember her name um she's not
[50:55] kabati she's from Solomon they look
[50:58] different now this brother here this
[51:00] brother here he's he started going
[51:02] around saying
[51:05] hey follow God one follow God belong
[51:08] Lord Jesus Christ papt picking an e me
[51:12] title Holy Ghost e me title leave me no
[51:14] name he just starts blasting this
[51:17] around so what he's saying is there's
[51:19] not three Gods there's one and his name
[51:21] is the Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy
[51:23] Ghost are just titles there's no power
[51:25] in that name that's right and he say hey
[51:27] baptism hey you got to be baptized in
[51:28] Name Lord Jesus Christ he hasn't been
[51:29] baptized yet but hey lights are turning
[51:31] on Amen so praise God Amen so that's
[51:34] exciting and that's brother Ari's
[51:36] daughter there amen so pray for
[51:39] them um pray for
[51:42] them God that God the light would
[51:45] completely go on I just keept saying
[51:49] this fellow message imy Jesus Christ
[51:51] revealed more than Doctrine more than
[51:53] Church IMO denomination
[51:55] God being made real amen he said yes in
[52:00] through he said okay sorry maybe I
[52:02] should stop this is so this is this is
[52:04] Brother Francis he's in
[52:06] honiara um this is where we uh we stayed
[52:10] with him and his family so brother
[52:11] Francis and his wife just before we went
[52:13] to the Solomons they went to so brother
[52:16] Jim Carman he goes to brother qu's
[52:17] Church in Melbourne they had a camp they
[52:19] have their annual camp so they flew
[52:21] brother Francis and his wife over to the
[52:23] camp and it really impacted them the
[52:26] lives of the Believers they could see
[52:27] you know cuz they saw this message in
[52:29] action and it really really changed them
[52:32] amen really helped them so I had a lot
[52:34] of good discussions with him too and he
[52:36] said man this he said this message is
[52:38] different than a bible school it's
[52:40] completely different to what we've had
[52:42] before I said yes cuz it's Revelation
[52:43] it's God revealing himself it's not
[52:45] learning something so you just keep them
[52:47] in prayer um yeah God's doing great
[52:51] things I believe Maybe Baby Steps but
[52:54] hey everything's got to start somewhere
[52:56] so amen so praise the Lord let's um so
[52:59] that's in a very small nutshell I got a
[53:01] lot more videos and photos if you want
[53:03] them I'm happy to send them to you amen
[53:04] but let's stand shall we um let's just
[53:07] go to the scripture amen because this
[53:10] this whole trip got me thinking on one
[53:13] thing we're going to go to Mark uh
[53:16] 11:20 um this got me thinking about
[53:18] really you know to especially that
[53:22] incident with that uh demon possessed
[53:24] girl you know you can't put on love you
[53:27] can't manufacture you can't manufacture
[53:30] having a real compassion and and that's
[53:33] how it will be with the third pole that
[53:35] we've seen Among Us is you can't
[53:36] manufacture it and so I want to just go
[53:39] into that this morning um but it's great
[53:42] to be home amen be happy too
[53:45] much okay so Mark 11:20 and in the
[53:49] morning as they passed by they saw the
[53:50] fig tree dried up from the roots and
[53:52] Peter calling to remembrance saith unto
[53:54] him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[53:57] thou curses is withered away and Jesus
[54:00] answering saith unto them have faith in
[54:03] God for verely I say unto you that
[54:05] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[54:07] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[54:09] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[54:11] but shall believe that those things
[54:13] which he saith shall come to pass he
[54:16] shall have whatsoever he saith therefore
[54:19] I say unto you that uh what things
[54:21] soever you desire When you pray believe
[54:24] that ye receive them and you shall have
[54:26] them and when ye standing praying
[54:29] forgive if you have ought against any
[54:31] that your father also which is in heaven
[54:33] May forgive you your trespasses but if
[54:36] you do not forgive neither will your
[54:38] father which is in heaven forgive your
[54:40] trespasses amen so let's bow our heads
[54:42] in a word of prayer and let's Commit
[54:44] This Time To The Lord gracious father
[54:46] we're so than Lord I'm so happy to be
[54:48] here at home Lord with your precious
[54:50] children Lord Jesus to be in this church

[55:14] every life Lord Jesus may you anoint
[55:16] speaker and hearer and may we just be

[55:23] this time we pray for any anyone who's
[55:25] not here today Lord we just want to
[55:27] commit them into your hands as well
[55:28] those who may be watching who are sick
[55:29] and body father we're so thankful you're
[55:31] mindful of us Lord no matter where we
[55:33] are we love you Lord in Jesus Christ's
[55:36] name amen amen amen God bless you
[55:38] friends you can have your seats this
[55:40] morning so I want to speak about
[55:43] the the power of the spoken word and how
[55:46] it cannot and will not be uh there will
[55:50] not be caral impersonations even though
[55:52] people will attempt to kindly
[55:54] impersonate now as we've read this here
[55:56] we understand that uh brother Bram he
[56:00] said that he would he he actually would
[56:03] not preach on this scripture for a very
[56:05] long time because he did not understand
[56:06] it that it seemed to be as if someone
[56:09] could just say say something they wanted
[56:11] and God would just do it but he he would
[56:14] he would come to find out that it's not
[56:17] actually when it says whatever things ye
[56:19] desire uh that's not your human desire
[56:22] that's God's desire comes into you and
[56:24] manifest his word it's not because we
[56:27] must realize you know I know um you know
[56:29] there was like a few years ago there was
[56:30] a brother that Andy knows from way back
[56:32] in the day um he sent me clips of him
[56:35] preaching now he's just a Pentecostal
[56:37] guy and he was giving me examples like
[56:39] you can say Let There Be house and
[56:41] there'll be house and let there be this
[56:42] and it'll be this I thought no that is
[56:45] not how it works because that's just a
[56:47] human desire wanting human things but
[56:50] when we come to a place you see God is
[56:52] looking for character and that character
[56:54] to me is a full fully surrendered life
[56:56] it's a fully surrendered life that's the
[56:58] true character God is looking for that
[57:01] it's not what we want it's what he wants
[57:03] amen so there has to come a time where
[57:07] our desires are not wrapped up in
[57:09] spiritual things to try and hide it as
[57:11] our desires but it's God's Own desire
[57:14] amen it's what he wants now you know
[57:17] Jesus Jesus was Jesus was our example
[57:20] amen we yeah we know that right now we
[57:23] got to we got to stand now I I just ask
[57:26] this question as I try and collect my
[57:27] thoughts now uh what's the difference
[57:30] between these two one's biger and one
[57:33] yes one's big and one's small what are
[57:36] they
[57:37] both so the nature and the big one and
[57:40] the nature and the small one are they
[57:42] different I like Liam he's cool amen I'm
[57:46] glad there's someone who answers just
[57:47] straight no good on you bro but you see
[57:50] they're both sheep right I know this is
[57:52] well I'm glad you're all sitting down I
[57:54] can tell you these things but you see
[57:56] they're both sheep okay there is never
[58:00] in the history of the Bible or any real
[58:01] Christian that where you know the devil
[58:04] gets into people's minds that we go from
[58:06] a
[58:07] sheep where it's not our will the
[58:10] shepherd's leading us it's not what we
[58:12] want it's what he wants we're
[58:13] surrendered then somehow we somehow get
[58:15] to this maturity and is now what we
[58:17] want no that's not how it works amen you
[58:20] can go from well actually you can go
[58:22] from sheep to Wolf like your first
[58:24] nature you're born with an year you can
[58:25] have what you want but we want what God
[58:27] wants right so even remember when Jesus
[58:30] was when Jesus was pointed out by John
[58:32] John said Behold the Lamb of God that
[58:34] takes away the sin of the world okay you
[58:37] say but we're Eagles yes we have an
[58:38] eagle anointing but we're still sheep I
[58:40] mean where God anoints us and we can see
[58:42] from eternity to Eternity it gives us
[58:44] stability in our life to realize what
[58:46] we're going through right now is not the
[58:48] End Amen we're going through the trial
[58:50] we're not staying in the trial but you
[58:52] see the great challenge is to stay a
[58:54] sheep to let God live Amen Let God speak
[58:57] amen as Jesus himself even said he said
[59:00] the son can do nothing of himself what
[59:02] he sees the father doeth so what things
[59:05] soever he doeth these also doeth the son
[59:07] likewise now we know Jesus was led by
[59:10] Vision therefore he saw a vision and
[59:12] then he walked into that vision and
[59:14] fulfilled the vision you say I've never
[59:15] seen a vision before but if you have the
[59:17] same Holy Ghost you may never see a
[59:19] vision in your life but you can be led
[59:21] exactly the same way according to his
[59:23] word and this is the character God is
[59:25] looking for amen he's not looking for
[59:27] people who can quote the quotes quote
[59:29] the scriptures and not be surrendered
[59:31] amen how many religious Spirits are
[59:33] there in the world that will quote
[59:34] brother Brandon will quote the scripture
[59:36] till the cows come home and yet not be
[59:38] surrendered to the word of God where the
[59:40] word of God cannot manifest flow through
[59:42] those people amen but I don't believe
[59:44] I'm looking at those kind of people
[59:45] today I believe I'm looking at prisoners
[59:47] amen who are surrended sold out to the
[59:50] word of God that let God live amen so
[59:53] they're both sheep they both have sheep
[59:55] nature we will always be
[59:58] Sheep
[59:59] amen we'll always be sheep doesn't
[1:00:02] matter how old you are how long in the
[1:00:04] Troth you become you're still a Sheep
[1:00:05] amen amen therefore you need a Shepherd
[1:00:09] amen so now the Apostle Paul would say
[1:00:13] this and this is one of my favorite
[1:00:14] scriptures he say I'm crucified with
[1:00:16] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:00:19] Christ liveth in me so he says yes I'm
[1:00:21] alive but it's not me living no more
[1:00:23] brother Ram said if you had the spirit
[1:00:25] of Beethoven in you you would write
[1:00:26] write great music if you had the spirit
[1:00:28] of Michelangelo in you you would great
[1:00:30] you would paint great masterpieces do
[1:00:32] great pieces of art if you had the
[1:00:34] spirit of John Dillinger in you who was
[1:00:35] a gangster I think you'd have guns and
[1:00:37] shoot people different things but if you
[1:00:39] had the spirit of Jesus Christ in you
[1:00:40] you will do the works of Jesus Christ
[1:00:42] because it's no longer you living no
[1:00:44] more two people can't live in the same
[1:00:46] house it's either you or God to let God
[1:00:48] live amen that's why there's a challenge
[1:00:51] in this day of self-will and people's
[1:00:53] rights and what I want to forfeit all
[1:00:55] those things and let God have
[1:00:57] preeminence amen that's the great
[1:00:59] challenge but I believe we're built with
[1:01:00] a we have been given an ability by
[1:01:03] surrendering we can surrender to the
[1:01:04] word of God Amen praise God we can
[1:01:07] surrender so he's saying see I live but
[1:01:10] it's not me living am mean it's Christ
[1:01:12] that liveth in me and the life which I
[1:01:14] now live in the flesh I live by the
[1:01:16] faith of the Son of God so was the faith
[1:01:18] of God that was motivating his life it
[1:01:21] wasn't his own motivation he did not
[1:01:23] wake up in the morning and say feel like
[1:01:25] doing this today in terms of let's go
[1:01:27] preach in this place he did want to go
[1:01:28] preach in Asia but the spirit forbade
[1:01:30] him right so he and and so even when his
[1:01:33] will was contrary to the will of the
[1:01:35] Holy Ghost he surrendered his will that
[1:01:37] the Holy Ghost lived amen and to me this
[1:01:39] is incredibly powerful because you got
[1:01:41] to realize that Paul is the example not
[1:01:44] just of the example Minister but the
[1:01:46] example Christian where he could live
[1:01:48] such a surrendered life in such an age
[1:01:50] of of heathenism and idolatry and
[1:01:53] self-will and eth eics and things he
[1:01:55] could live a life where it's only he
[1:01:57] only wanted to do that which pleased the
[1:01:59] father just like Jesus amen and we know
[1:02:01] that the Apostle Paul if you have the
[1:02:04] faith of the Son of God in your life
[1:02:05] you're made of the same material but
[1:02:08] failure comes when human ability wants
[1:02:10] to override the will of God and it does
[1:02:13] Amen so see it's not something it's not
[1:02:16] see the power we understand that the
[1:02:18] third pull is here am right Amen brother
[1:02:22] R says well it's see well I just find it
[1:02:24] here once again
[1:02:26] U some people will just we know brother
[1:02:30] Bram was wondering through his ministry
[1:02:32] from 1956 when he saw the visions of the
[1:02:35] of the of of of lacing the shoe and
[1:02:37] fishing in the tent and all these things
[1:02:39] what the manifestation of the third pull
[1:02:41] would be but he comes to the end of his
[1:02:43] ministry and he says the third pull is
[1:02:45] the opening of the word the Myster is
[1:02:46] revealed but some people will take this
[1:02:48] and say well the third pole is just KN
[1:02:50] correct Doctrine but it's more than that
[1:02:52] because when the word comes open to a
[1:02:54] person there's a manifestation there's a
[1:02:56] supernatural manifestation you take
[1:02:58] Caleb and Joshua when they were standing
[1:03:01] there and hearing Moses reveal the law
[1:03:03] of God reveal the heart of God for them
[1:03:05] it the word became open to them and what
[1:03:08] was the manifestation Caleb said at 84
[1:03:11] years old I'm as strong now as I was
[1:03:13] when I came out of Egypt give me my
[1:03:15] Mountain amen that was the manifestation
[1:03:17] it wasn't an argument it wasn't well I
[1:03:19] don't think Moses and blah blah blah no
[1:03:21] God revealed it to him this is the truth
[1:03:23] I'm going to walk in it and God gave him
[1:03:25] prevailing power to take his inheritance
[1:03:28] amen you take the same thing with Joshua
[1:03:30] Joshua was a minister unto Moses and he
[1:03:32] saw the power of a surrendered life that
[1:03:34] when he crossed the Jordan an angel of
[1:03:36] the Lord came with a sword drawn he
[1:03:38] prostrated himself in front of him
[1:03:40] saying you're my king you're the general
[1:03:42] as the Lord as he asked the Lord or
[1:03:44] asked that man he didn't know it was God
[1:03:45] at that stage he says who are you for us
[1:03:47] or against us and and and and and the
[1:03:50] Lord said no but I come as the angel of
[1:03:52] the Lord the captain of the host and so
[1:03:54] God came down and said to said to Joshua
[1:03:57] I'm not for you or against you I've come
[1:03:59] to take over your battle amen amen so
[1:04:01] I'm not just here to help you I'm come
[1:04:02] to be the Supreme General in this
[1:04:04] campaign and that's the same thing with
[1:04:06] you and I when the Holy Ghost actually
[1:04:08] takes full leadership in our lives what
[1:04:10] does that do he comes down to take over
[1:04:12] that's why the anointing of God comes
[1:04:14] down into church because he wants to
[1:04:15] take over your human battles he wants to
[1:04:17] take over your life he wants to take
[1:04:18] over your family he wants to rule your
[1:04:20] thought life he wants to rule every part
[1:04:22] of your life that's what he wants to do
[1:04:24] and that wasn't just for taking Jericho
[1:04:26] that was for the whole campaign amen
[1:04:28] it's the same thing with you and I God
[1:04:30] has come down in this end time amen the
[1:04:32] mighty Angel has descended to take over
[1:04:34] our human battles I mean to to lead us
[1:04:36] all the way into Rapture that's what
[1:04:38] he's come to do I mean we're going to
[1:04:40] recognize him as king he can't just be
[1:04:42] our savior and just a just something you
[1:04:44] pull out like an insurance policy no
[1:04:46] he's got to be your king I mean will you
[1:04:48] don't inject yourself into what he tells
[1:04:49] you to do you let him lead you every
[1:04:52] part of the way I mean he Li when he was
[1:04:54] standing on Mount carel he would have
[1:04:56] the he would have the altar there he had
[1:04:57] it all prepared and he says Lord I've
[1:05:00] done this all according to your word I
[1:05:02] mean so what did he do he saw a vision
[1:05:04] he didn't just decide one day I'm going
[1:05:05] to go challenge the priest of baale I'm
[1:05:07] sick of this nonsense no God told him
[1:05:10] God showed him by Vision gather the
[1:05:12] priest go to Ahab do exactly what I tell
[1:05:15] you to do and I'll bring fire down
[1:05:17] that's why he so so he walked into the
[1:05:19] vision he did not inject his own
[1:05:21] thoughts into what God was telling him
[1:05:23] to do he was surr enough I mean that's
[1:05:25] the spirit of Elijah I mean to be
[1:05:27] surrendered enough to let God completely
[1:05:29] fulfill his word and when the vision
[1:05:31] became material he says God I've done
[1:05:34] this all according to your word and may
[1:05:35] the people know you're Jehovah and
[1:05:37] you've turned their hearts back again
[1:05:38] and the fire fell and consumed it
[1:05:40] exactly exactly he has shown in the
[1:05:42] vision and friends that's how we've got
[1:05:44] to be we can't inject
[1:05:46] ourselves our human ability into our
[1:05:48] Christian Walk we're going to let God
[1:05:50] lead us you got to let him lead you
[1:05:52] because that's good character amen bad
[1:05:54] character injects themselves into what
[1:05:56] they think God's telling them to do good
[1:05:58] character is surrender to the word of
[1:05:59] God and they let God lead amen so so the
[1:06:03] third PLL has a manifestation we know
[1:06:05] that there's the five instances of you
[1:06:07] know in brother braham's life where
[1:06:08] there's the manifestation of the third
[1:06:10] pole the power of the spoken word when
[1:06:12] know there's that fish got its life back
[1:06:14] there's a storm spoken out of existence
[1:06:15] there in Colorado that blizzard that he
[1:06:17] was in I mean that tum of the size of a
[1:06:19] grapefruit on the side of his wife was
[1:06:21] was spoken out of existence before the
[1:06:24] exactly as the Lord um exactly as he
[1:06:26] asked the Lord because the Lord came
[1:06:27] down and said say what you will and it
[1:06:29] shall be that's character for God to
[1:06:32] come to a person what do you desire what
[1:06:36] do you have need of just like king of
[1:06:38] hazaras coming to Esther your es will
[1:06:40] come before the king what do you have
[1:06:41] need of will give you even half the
[1:06:43] kingdom see she had the right kind of a
[1:06:45] character just like brother Braham he
[1:06:47] had the right kind of character where
[1:06:49] God said ask what you will and it shall
[1:06:51] be amen and so what was his desire he
[1:06:53] said Lord before the surgeon goes to cut
[1:06:55] my wife may that tumor disappear amen
[1:06:57] and the surgeon goes to cut there was a
[1:06:59] cool Bree sign came into the room and
[1:07:01] the size of a grapefruit of a tumor just
[1:07:04] disappeared the storm you know the
[1:07:06] squirrels were spoken into existence had
[1:07:08] writes boys received eternal life amen
[1:07:11] why because that a power was placed in
[1:07:14] the hands of a mortal redeemed Son of
[1:07:16] God Amen but you got to realize now that
[1:07:18] it was had Wright's faith that caused it
[1:07:20] to come into being am me for the
[1:07:22] Salvation of her two sons that power is
[1:07:24] in you today amen if you've got the holy
[1:07:27] ghost that power is in you where God can
[1:07:29] step on the scene and do the miraculous
[1:07:31] amen because remember before that
[1:07:33] conversation where brother Brown was
[1:07:34] sharing the testimonies of the squirrels
[1:07:36] and different things they were
[1:07:37] snickering and laughing and making fun
[1:07:39] they weren't they weren't sitting there
[1:07:40] saying oh my he's Elijah oh my the
[1:07:43] Bible's living again oh my this is true
[1:07:45] no they are sniggering and laughing but
[1:07:47] her faith amen brought God on the scene
[1:07:50] and overrode their attitudes overrode
[1:07:52] their unbelief and brought them into the
[1:07:54] kingdom how much more you and I friends
[1:07:56] amen I believe that same power is in the
[1:07:58] room this morning I believe it's in you
[1:08:00] and I amen where people can be going a
[1:08:02] certain way but you can respond in faith
[1:08:04] to the word amen and God can step on the
[1:08:06] scene this ain't pie in the sky this is
[1:08:08] reality amen when I was there in the
[1:08:11] Solomon Islands that love and that
[1:08:12] compassion came over me that wasn't
[1:08:14] generated by me that was God and it
[1:08:16] wasn't a long drawn out thing it was
[1:08:18] just maybe 2 minutes and she was free
[1:08:20] from when I went down there to when she
[1:08:21] walked out sane and whole it was about
[1:08:23] maybe 2 not even that wow amen amen that
[1:08:26] wasn't me that's God Amen but we're got
[1:08:29] to realize that power is within us amen
[1:08:32] amen we can't be afraid we we don't need
[1:08:34] to be afraid of the devil amen amen or
[1:08:36] any of his tricks amen you got to
[1:08:37] realize that there power of the spoken
[1:08:39] word because remember the same anointing
[1:08:41] in the prophet as in you and I he didn't
[1:08:43] have a different Holy Ghost he had the
[1:08:45] same Holy Ghost I mean the same holy
[1:08:47] ghost that fell in the day of Pentecost
[1:08:48] dwelt in him amen is now in the bride of
[1:08:51] Christ amen and he says that the voice
[1:08:53] of God is in the bride once again amen
[1:08:55] that the world will hear direct from
[1:08:57] direct from heaven like they did at
[1:08:58] Pentecost amen so that voices in you and
[1:09:01] I it's not just on tape it's not meant
[1:09:02] to stay in the Bible it's not meant to
[1:09:04] stay in book form but that word must
[1:09:05] come and live inside you and I that it's
[1:09:07] not you speaking it's de speaking cuz
[1:09:10] you got to realize that when you stand
[1:09:11] in faith and speak the word amen across
[1:09:14] anointed lips it's the same as deity
[1:09:16] speaking and every Mountain has to move
[1:09:19] nothing can stand before that person but
[1:09:21] you got to realize that's not new just
[1:09:22] working out what to say that's God
[1:09:25] inspiration moves upon your life and you
[1:09:27] begin to speak hallu we've seen it here
[1:09:30] have we not many times not just
[1:09:31] preaching but in prayer lines and and
[1:09:33] and and prayer services different things
[1:09:35] God step in amen manifest himself
[1:09:38] through the gifts or through anointed
[1:09:40] people same thing amen God doing what he
[1:09:42] wants to
[1:09:43] do hallelujah amen amen I believe it
[1:09:47] amen but you see now there's just as he
[1:09:49] says here there'll be Janice and jambres
[1:09:51] rise up there'll be impersonators trying
[1:09:54] to impersonate this but the angel of the
[1:09:56] Lord told Brother brah this cannot be
[1:09:58] impersonated Hallelujah don't even
[1:10:00] really try and explain it cuz you tried
[1:10:02] to explain the first and second Paul
[1:10:04] don't try and explain this God and flesh
[1:10:07] manifesting himself because people are
[1:10:08] trying and people still try and
[1:10:10] impersonate it today because they have
[1:10:12] such a hunger and a Longing To See God
[1:10:14] live if you want to see that hunger
[1:10:16] satisfied just die to yourself just die
[1:10:19] out to your caral ideas die out to
[1:10:20] reasoning let yourself die and rot Amen
[1:10:23] to superstitions and problems and
[1:10:25] complex just just let it all go that's
[1:10:27] the only way you can see God live it's
[1:10:29] not you trying to work it out and trying
[1:10:31] to no just just die out see this is the
[1:10:34] great problem people don't want to die I
[1:10:36] mean people want the message they want
[1:10:37] to be religious but they don't want to
[1:10:39] die just let God live Amen Let God have
[1:10:41] his way he knows what he's doing he's
[1:10:43] been in this business for a long time
[1:10:45] amen it won't be you and I that pull up
[1:10:47] our bootstraps and take ourselves in a
[1:10:49] Rapture no it's the Sovereign Grace of
[1:10:50] God Amen and every time we've seen a
[1:10:52] supernatural happening here or anywhere
[1:10:55] it's God's sovereignty steps into this
[1:10:58] room and takes over amen and that's what
[1:11:00] we got to do is yield to him let him
[1:11:02] live amen like never before amen this
[1:11:04] could be the last year upon the Earth
[1:11:06] let him live amen you could look back
[1:11:08] when you're around the throne said I let
[1:11:09] you live Lord I let you have my have
[1:11:12] your way in my life that's what I wanted
[1:11:14] Lord and I saw you do it hallelujah
[1:11:17] hallelujah glory to God Amen praise the
[1:11:19] Lord so the Janice and jamby
[1:11:21] impersonators would appear again in the
[1:11:22] last day now we know those those Janice
[1:11:25] and jambres they were the court M uh
[1:11:27] magicians of pharaoh and so Moses and
[1:11:30] Aaron came into Pharaoh's Throne Room
[1:11:32] said let my people go God speaking
[1:11:34] through Moses he was actually a God to
[1:11:36] the people he threw down his sticket
[1:11:38] turned into a serpent Pharaoh stood
[1:11:41] there or sat on his throne got his
[1:11:42] magicians to do the same thing and it
[1:11:44] just hardened the heart of pharaoh and
[1:11:46] that's what caral impersonations do they
[1:11:48] hid in the heart of the people that's
[1:11:50] why it's such a problem counterfeit
[1:11:52] Christianity out there it hardens the
[1:11:54] people's hearts and I say well before
[1:11:56] there's counterfeit there's got to be a
[1:11:58] real amen cuz counterfeit money isn't
[1:12:00] made first the Real's made first amen
[1:12:02] but the real actually can has purchasing
[1:12:05] power in it amen the Cardinal's got no
[1:12:07] purchasing power but the real is
[1:12:08] purchasing power am mean if I had a
[1:12:10] million dollars of genuine money I could
[1:12:12] buy a million dollars worth of whatever
[1:12:14] but if it's just counterfeit it can look
[1:12:16] the same but it won't produce the same
[1:12:17] results amen the transaction won't go
[1:12:20] through amen but if you got genuine
[1:12:21] faith and a genuine the genuine word of
[1:12:24] God you'll see the transaction go
[1:12:25] through am mean you'll see the promise
[1:12:27] of God fulfilled amen so it hardens the
[1:12:30] hearts of people but don't look at the
[1:12:32] don't look at the counterfeit look at
[1:12:33] the genuine the devil wants you to study
[1:12:35] counterfeit Christianity I say he's
[1:12:37] you're wasting your time ien people have
[1:12:40] all of these YouTube channels saying
[1:12:41] this is wrong and this is wrong and
[1:12:43] that's wrong I thought tell me something
[1:12:45] that can help me amen it can't help me
[1:12:47] no good to point out the problems of you
[1:12:50] know of the church and this and this and
[1:12:51] whatever more that doesn't give me Faith
[1:12:53] amen no faith is when the promises of
[1:12:55] God have preached and power
[1:12:57] demonstration it's received into a sold
[1:12:59] out life and that same word amen is
[1:13:01] manifested that's what we need friends
[1:13:03] is to lift up the real lift up Jesus
[1:13:06] Christ Lift up his word into its right
[1:13:08] position am mean because he has a name
[1:13:10] above all names amen don't let your mind
[1:13:12] battle be telling you that that that
[1:13:14] that that it is greater than his name no
[1:13:16] everything must bow to the name of Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ amen I've seen the you know we're
[1:13:20] there there we're in monsoon season we

[1:13:26] rain and you know we were we were going
[1:13:28] to walk back to where we were staying
[1:13:31] about 5 km pouring down with rain I said

[1:13:56] so even a bonus you know but you see we
[1:13:58] should ask that our Joys be full amen
[1:14:00] that God and what is the joy seeing God
[1:14:02] live I mean seeing his promises
[1:14:04] fulfilled it's not a selfish see if

[1:14:08] you're not going to get anywhere with
[1:14:09] God Amen you may play you may speak the
[1:14:12] part and play the part but no if you got
[1:14:14] selfish ambition it won't help you none
[1:14:17] now hallelujah praise the Lord I'm just
[1:14:19] trying to
[1:14:21] find says in Philipp
[1:14:24] chapter 2 because as I started off
[1:14:26] saying Jesus is the Lamb of God that
[1:14:28] takes away the sin of the world Amen he
[1:14:30] would actually before we go there you
[1:14:32] know he would actually say because
[1:14:34] Philip said show us the father and it
[1:14:36] will satisfy us it will suffice with us
[1:14:38] and Jesus said have I have been so long
[1:14:40] with you he says it's not me that doeth
[1:14:42] the works it's the father that dwelleth
[1:14:44] in me doeth the works so G we know Jesus
[1:14:47] was the god man right but he was he was
[1:14:50] made like us he had to be our kinsman
[1:14:51] redeemer born but yet without sin virgin
[1:14:53] birth created in the womb of Mary amen
[1:14:56] but but he was man like we're man
[1:14:58] tempted on All Points yet without sin
[1:15:01] amen people think you know even in the
[1:15:03] Sodom Sodom and Gomorrah age anything
[1:15:06] that you've been tempted with in this
[1:15:07] age Jesus was tempted by because the
[1:15:10] Bible says that amen so he understands
[1:15:13] temptation but he knows what it's like
[1:15:15] to overcome amen so now but he says it's
[1:15:17] not me that doeth the works amen see
[1:15:20] even even the words that I speak unto
[1:15:22] you I speak not of my self but the
[1:15:23] father that dwelleth in me he doeth The
[1:15:26] Works see even he recognized this is not
[1:15:28] me this is not my desire even this is
[1:15:30] not even my thought it's my father comes
[1:15:33] lives in me and he manifests his Plan of
[1:15:35] Salvation through me amen and now if
[1:15:37] that was the if that was the bridegroom
[1:15:39] speaking like that how much more the
[1:15:41] bride of Christ how much more amen his
[1:15:43] bride amen shouldn't it be when we give
[1:15:45] a testimony it's not me that doeth the
[1:15:47] works my father dwelleth in me doeth the
[1:15:49] works amen it wasn't it's not my
[1:15:51] testimony it's his testimony it's not my
[1:15:53] overcoming power it's his overcoming
[1:15:55] power in me amen it's not my might it's
[1:15:57] not by power it's by his spirit amen
[1:15:59] that's how it should be shouldn't it
[1:16:01] amen that we should be able to look at
[1:16:02] our lives and say it was all you Lord it
[1:16:05] wasn't me it was you amen and this is
[1:16:08] what this see this message has come to
[1:16:10] place Jesus in the right place am you
[1:16:12] see churches put him as a second or
[1:16:14] third person of a godhead but he's
[1:16:16] Supreme deity amen the Bible declares
[1:16:18] him the king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:16:20] amen and so it puts him in his right
[1:16:22] place that his name is above all names
[1:16:25] amen and when that goes from a theory to
[1:16:27] a reality in your life then the word of
[1:16:29] God will have preeminence amen he will
[1:16:30] be be the Supreme one hallelujah
[1:16:33] hallelujah amen so I think we can say
[1:16:36] it's not us that doth the works as the
[1:16:38] father dwth he he does it all have you
[1:16:41] ever become but you see the devil wants
[1:16:44] to make us a stuffed shirt oh yeah
[1:16:47] saying I'm big now I know what I'm doing
[1:16:51] that stuff shirt material am we are
[1:16:54] meant to be Lambs we are always meant to
[1:16:56] be depend depending on him am amen we're
[1:16:59] not meant we never are called to get to
[1:17:01] a position and say now okay God thank
[1:17:03] you now I can take over amen cuz you've
[1:17:05] TR no no no no no no it's always him all
[1:17:07] the way you look at jesus' life you know
[1:17:10] there was not one point in his ministry
[1:17:12] he said okay thanks father I'm done I
[1:17:14] mean you're done now you can re relax
[1:17:16] I'm mature enough I can do it no he was
[1:17:19] completely dependent he was 100% sold
[1:17:22] out to the spirit of God within him amen
[1:17:25] he never ever humanly injected his own
[1:17:27] self into leading himself he was the
[1:17:30] Lamb of God amen amen help us Lord
[1:17:35] Jesus amen but you see now Philippians 2
[1:17:38] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[1:17:41] having the same love being of one Accord
[1:17:43] of one mind let nothing be done through
[1:17:46] Strife or vain Glory but in loness
[1:17:48] loneliness of Mind Let each other esteem
[1:17:52] uh other better than themselves look not
[1:17:55] every man on his own things but every
[1:17:57] man also on the things of others let
[1:17:58] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:18:01] Christ Jesus see there's got to be a
[1:18:02] yielding amen see Paul's saying let it
[1:18:05] let him rule you don't let your five
[1:18:07] senses rule you don't let your
[1:18:09] imagination your conscious affections
[1:18:11] reasoning whatever more don't let those
[1:18:12] things rule you Amen Let Him rule you
[1:18:15] it's like Joshua when they had the five
[1:18:17] Kings there you know Joshua when he said
[1:18:19] sun and moon stand still do you think
[1:18:20] that was him no that was God
[1:18:23] I believe God's H him what do you have
[1:18:24] need of I'm fighting a battle Lord say
[1:18:26] what you will and it shall be done while
[1:18:28] the Sun's going down we need this more
[1:18:30] sunlight to destroy our enemies that was
[1:18:32] God's inspiration see God speaks and we
[1:18:35] respond hallelujah amen that that's how
[1:18:39] Christians are God speaks we respond to
[1:18:41] his word and then he fulfills it in our
[1:18:42] lives it's never us
[1:18:45] first Eve wanted to go ahead of the plan
[1:18:47] of God and look what happened to the
[1:18:50] world Amen
[1:18:53] where worry yes who being in the form of
[1:18:55] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:18:57] with God but made himself of no
[1:18:59] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:19:01] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:19:03] of men and being found fashioned as a
[1:19:05] man he humbled himself became obedient
[1:19:07] unto death even the death of the Cross
[1:19:10] so let nothing be done through Strife or
[1:19:12] vain Glory now this word strife means
[1:19:14] electioneering or Intrigue for office
[1:19:16] it's a desire to put oneself
[1:19:19] forward that's not a sheep mentality
[1:19:22] that's not a hold out mentality our our
[1:19:25] heart should be Lord I don't care if I'm
[1:19:27] a it doesn't matter if I'm even
[1:19:29] remembered but may you be made known may
[1:19:32] you be declared may people know you I
[1:19:34] don't care about me I want people to
[1:19:36] meet you and know you that the impact of
[1:19:38] my life is that you lived and people saw
[1:19:41] your word living in my life amen but see
[1:19:44] that The Strife of electioneering what's
[1:19:46] electioneering vote for me I've got all
[1:19:49] the answers I can solve your problems I
[1:19:51] can make these promises say I can do
[1:19:53] this we had an
[1:19:54] election you know it's like a lolly
[1:19:56] scramble the Solomons is going to have
[1:19:58] an election soon it just becomes a lolly
[1:20:00] scramble this for this and this for this
[1:20:02] and this for this and this for this and
[1:20:04] then they get voted and they say I'm
[1:20:05] sorry we can't fulfill it sorry true
[1:20:09] me you you know but it's just everywhere
[1:20:12] like that you see but so we shouldn't be
[1:20:14] electioneering we shouldn't see people
[1:20:17] who are really called run from the job
[1:20:19] people who are not called think they
[1:20:21] should do the job and they try and do
[1:20:22] the job and they can't do the job
[1:20:25] amen that's why people run I say hey
[1:20:29] come don't get tired just give
[1:20:32] up but people who oh yeah I want to be
[1:20:34] this I want to be that now you got to
[1:20:36] die out to that brother Bram says when
[1:20:38] you receive the Holy Ghost it takes the
[1:20:39] big shot desire out of you wanting to be
[1:20:41] the big one amen so so it's the desire
[1:20:45] to put oneself forward am mean then vain
[1:20:47] Glory it means a vain Glory groundless
[1:20:50] it's a self-esteem which is confidence
[1:20:52] in one's own Worth or ability
[1:20:54] self-respect so we don't want to do
[1:20:56] things through our own ability or or
[1:20:59] what we think we are humanly see we
[1:21:02] should know our worth in God's eyes that
[1:21:04] we are a jewel in his crown we are love
[1:21:06] gifts for Christ amen we are his bride
[1:21:09] we are his everything we are his all in
[1:21:11] all we are the purpose of his being is
[1:21:14] US redeemed amen that's what how God
[1:21:16] views us amen one soul is worth more
[1:21:18] than 10,000 worlds you look at the blood
[1:21:20] of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary
[1:21:22] he put your life above his own life
[1:21:25] because if he put his life above your
[1:21:26] life he would never have died so in his
[1:21:29] eyes you are more valuable than his own
[1:21:32] life amen but you see the thing is when
[1:21:35] you realize your worth in God's eyes
[1:21:37] that doesn't make your stuff sh that
[1:21:39] doesn't make you think you're the
[1:21:40] greatest one it makes you humble isn't
[1:21:43] that right when you think the great king
[1:21:44] of glory that just spoke all the stars
[1:21:47] into existence and it says in Genesis
[1:21:49] and he made the heavens and the Earth or
[1:21:51] made the Stars also just like his side
[1:21:52] note made all these great things he he
[1:21:56] put you above him in value shouldn't
[1:21:59] that doesn't that make you humble the
[1:22:01] greatest king the king of glory more
[1:22:04] than some trending hashtag person on
[1:22:06] some media thing
[1:22:10] amen he put you at greater value I'm
[1:22:13] stressing this point because it should
[1:22:14] make you feel it should make you feel
[1:22:16] small not in terms of I'm nothing but in
[1:22:18] terms of thank you Lord thank you you
[1:22:20] came looking for me and this and this
[1:22:22] darkest crazy age we live in of 8
[1:22:24] billion people on the Earth he came
[1:22:26] looking for you amen cuz goodness and
[1:22:28] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:22:30] life and that word follow means to
[1:22:32] pursue and overcome amen so so so
[1:22:35] goodness and mercy when you were born
[1:22:37] was on your Trail hallu amen God's
[1:22:39] goodness and mercy was hunting you down
[1:22:41] and I don't know what age you were but
[1:22:42] it finally overtook you at a time
[1:22:44] appointed God said they're ready I can
[1:22:46] meet them now amen hallelujah what and
[1:22:49] then what happened you became a loved
[1:22:50] prisoner to Jesus Christ amen so so you
[1:22:53] should realize your your value in God's
[1:22:56] sight but you shouldn't ever think that
[1:22:59] you and your own human ability can do
[1:23:01] anything see it's the brother Braham
[1:23:03] stresses in the church age book in
[1:23:05] multiple places it's not by money the
[1:23:07] gospel goes forward it's not by Talent
[1:23:09] it's it's Sanctified consecrated lives
[1:23:12] to the word by the spirit of God that's
[1:23:14] what makes the gospel go forward amen so
[1:23:17] we must never think our own abilities
[1:23:19] you say well you say but brother Ben
[1:23:22] you've been pastoring 12 years you
[1:23:23] should know what you're
[1:23:24] doing
[1:23:27] no no no if I ever get to that point you
[1:23:30] might as well fire me oh boy amen
[1:23:34] because we are always sheep we are
[1:23:36] always depending on the leadership of
[1:23:38] the Lord amen we always trusting see we
[1:23:40] should realize the more we walk with God
[1:23:42] the more we need him amen amen I need
[1:23:45] him more than when I first met him I
[1:23:46] need him way more he say well he got
[1:23:48] more responsibilities no just for my own
[1:23:50] personal life I need him more you know
[1:23:52] so you know this is how we should feel
[1:23:55] amen that we should not try and do
[1:23:57] things through Strife or vain Glory see
[1:23:59] even even the Lord would say when he's
[1:24:01] in Gethsemane he says father not my will
[1:24:04] but thy will be done his human will cuz
[1:24:06] no one likes to die he knew by Vision
[1:24:08] what he had to suffer what he about to
[1:24:10] step into into Pilot's judgment Hall and
[1:24:12] being M more than any other man and
[1:24:14] dying the most shameful agonizing death
[1:24:16] that's possible he knew what he was
[1:24:18] going to experience he saw it by Vision
[1:24:20] but because he was so surrendered to the
[1:24:22] will of God he stepped into it hallu
[1:24:25] amen so you see this is how we should be
[1:24:28] amen the Lord we should let God live
[1:24:30] amen I trust we're all following but you
[1:24:32] see now impersonators will come to a
[1:24:34] certain point and they cannot
[1:24:36] impersonate anymore as I said about
[1:24:38] Janice and jambus they came to a point
[1:24:40] where they could not by their
[1:24:41] enchantments do the same plagues and
[1:24:44] they would say to they would say about
[1:24:46] the LI they couldn't do it and they said
[1:24:48] to Pharaoh this is the this is the
[1:24:50] Finger of God but Pharaoh's heart was
[1:24:52] hardened you see so people can have
[1:24:54] Miracles and healing when it comes to
[1:24:56] the power of the spoken word this will
[1:24:57] not be copied this will not be caral
[1:25:01] impersonations will try but they will
[1:25:03] fail amen because God doesn't want us to
[1:25:06] God doesn't want us to use caral
[1:25:07] impersonations or even try am mean you
[1:25:10] see because it's because it was
[1:25:12] prophesied say JIS and jambus as they
[1:25:14] withstood Moses so they would resist the
[1:25:16] truth in this day that anointing would
[1:25:18] return in the end time amen but as that
[1:25:21] same anointing has returned in the end
[1:25:23] time so has the Holy Ghost returned I
[1:25:26] mean brother Ram says that this the end
[1:25:28] time message releases the Holy Ghost
[1:25:30] upon the people cu the doctrines Creeds
[1:25:32] and dogmas of man don't gate up the
[1:25:34] power of God moving am mean that's why
[1:25:36] as we're returning back to the word
[1:25:37] God's pouring out his Spirit more and
[1:25:39] more I mean God's moving more and power
[1:25:41] I mean more love is being shable in our
[1:25:43] hearts God why cuz we're returning back
[1:25:45] to the word in faith sir Hallelujah you
[1:25:47] say well I got the Holy Ghost I've
[1:25:48] arrived but there's more promises to
[1:25:50] possess I mean there's more there's more
[1:25:52] reality of God to experience amen so as
[1:25:55] we return to the word in faith what God
[1:25:57] is moving in great power Hallelujah Lord
[1:26:00] amen so we got to realize now these
[1:26:02] things are sovereignly given now brother
[1:26:04] Ram was asked a question I didn't put
[1:26:05] the question up here but you go look in
[1:26:06] questions and answers 1964 part one and
[1:26:10] and someone asked them basically you
[1:26:12] have this power of the spoken word could
[1:26:13] you just speak over a person and that'
[1:26:15] be Rapture Ready filled with the spirit
[1:26:17] and brother says that you're believing
[1:26:19] because of the spoken words and things
[1:26:20] of that like he said about and you here
[1:26:23] witnessed the squirrels and all these
[1:26:25] other things that's been done but did
[1:26:27] you notice that was sovereignly given
[1:26:30] ien I never asked him Lord let me do
[1:26:32] this speak these things uh like that do
[1:26:34] these things there I never asked him
[1:26:36] that he by his own Divine will came to
[1:26:39] me and said you go do this see I wasn't
[1:26:43] asking one thing about it Moses never
[1:26:45] asked to go down in Egypt but it was God
[1:26:47] that sent him down to Egypt see now I
[1:26:50] believe that the Holy Spirit would come
[1:26:51] to me say in a vision go tell certain
[1:26:53] certain person that they're trying to
[1:26:55] overcome a certain thing they cannot do
[1:26:57] it and they're smoking they're drinking
[1:26:59] they're lying stealing committing
[1:27:00] adultery whatever it might be or they
[1:27:03] got a got lustful spirit and you just go
[1:27:06] where they are and say thou Spirit come
[1:27:08] out there I set this captive free would
[1:27:10] it would it take place absolutely yes
[1:27:12] indeed that's absolutely would it would
[1:27:14] take place but now upon my own but but
[1:27:17] now upon my own presuming presume means
[1:27:19] to venture Adventure without author
[1:27:22] Authority we got to realize that we have
[1:27:24] authority in this day we are not
[1:27:26] presuming in our Christian walk am me
[1:27:29] down through the church ages when there
[1:27:30] was a mix of Truth and error and God was
[1:27:32] restoring Sur there's a lot of presuming
[1:27:34] going on it was man's idea trying to put
[1:27:37] the word back together Bible schools and
[1:27:39] different things but we don't have Bible
[1:27:40] schools we don't have a collection of
[1:27:42] intellectual Minds that put the word
[1:27:44] together no we have be we have received
[1:27:45] thus sayith the Lord amen we have
[1:27:47] received the true interpretation to the
[1:27:49] word of God so now we are not presuming
[1:27:52] amen you all gone pretty qu quiet on me
[1:27:55] but you know we can Venture with
[1:27:57] authority right but what he's speaking
[1:27:59] about here and presuming is that the
[1:28:01] presuming is well the Bible says lay
[1:28:02] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:28:04] and you do that in faith but by a vision
[1:28:07] he's saying I've already seen it happen
[1:28:08] I walk into the vision I hope that makes
[1:28:10] that clear amen but you see but but what
[1:28:12] I'm saying is because the word has been
[1:28:14] restored we're not guessing can it work
[1:28:18] we've seen it work amen amen we've seen
[1:28:20] people surrender their lives receive the
[1:28:21] holy H ghost we've seen their lives be
[1:28:23] changed we know the Holy Ghost is still
[1:28:25] the same we've seen people healed demons
[1:28:27] cast out different things happen
[1:28:29] complexes broken healing take place
[1:28:31] marriage is being restored and so now we
[1:28:33] know there's nothing too hard for the
[1:28:35] Lord amen yes sir Hallelujah so amen see
[1:28:39] then I don't know I'd call upon the name
[1:28:41] of the Lord over them I can pray for
[1:28:43] them and do whatever I wish to do he
[1:28:45] says now if I had my own way this
[1:28:47] morning I had an interview with this
[1:28:49] little lady sitting in this wheelchair
[1:28:51] to come to this meeting today they had
[1:28:54] to have the fire department to take her
[1:28:55] out of the her house in Chicago and the
[1:28:58] people live across the street and don't
[1:29:00] come to the meeting see what would I do
[1:29:02] if it was in my power it is I have
[1:29:05] authority to do it but I have to wait
[1:29:07] for orders to do it this is why we
[1:29:10] should know the leadership of God Amen
[1:29:13] you should know God's leadership you
[1:29:15] should be able to look back in your life
[1:29:16] God said do such and such and such and
[1:29:18] you see it
[1:29:19] fulfilled you should be able to see that
[1:29:22] amen well he but he talks to me
[1:29:24] differently he should still talk to you
[1:29:25] amen amen whether it's through his word
[1:29:28] by Dream by Vision I don't know
[1:29:30] leadership still small voice but you
[1:29:32] should see God's leadership in your life
[1:29:35] it's absolutely Paramount that you know
[1:29:37] you're Leed by the shepherd amen you're
[1:29:39] not just wandering along well there's
[1:29:40] nice people nice group I'll go along no
[1:29:42] it's got to be an individual walk amen
[1:29:45] that if this church ceases to be you are
[1:29:47] still walking amen amen you still love
[1:29:50] the Lord you're still you're still
[1:29:51] walking because why it's an individual
[1:29:53] walk brother R said at the end of the
[1:29:55] church age book his desire was that the
[1:29:57] true spiritual relationship would be
[1:30:00] restored between man and
[1:30:01] God Amen that's the last part of the
[1:30:04] church age book that was the whole
[1:30:06] thrust of the ministry what was to
[1:30:08] reestablish a true spiritual
[1:30:10] relationship between God and man amen
[1:30:12] that it's not man their own ideas and
[1:30:14] maybe God it's just God and man I mean
[1:30:17] where God can declare his word he can
[1:30:19] speak things he can correct us he can
[1:30:21] put us on the right path amen amen
[1:30:23] that's true amen you see now see the see
[1:30:27] I have authority from God to do it but
[1:30:29] now when he gives the orders she'll go
[1:30:31] back home well see I know that is the
[1:30:33] truth see I'd just be willing to die
[1:30:35] this morning on that as I'd be on in in
[1:30:38] anything see it's the truth but first
[1:30:40] you see even Jesus himself said that the
[1:30:43] son can do nothing in himself but what
[1:30:44] he said the father do that do the son
[1:30:46] likewise we know that St John 5:19 the
[1:30:49] son doeth nothing in himself but what he
[1:30:51] see the father father doing that the son
[1:30:53] will do
[1:30:55] likewise amen so you see even the
[1:30:58] Apostle Paul was a
[1:30:59] prisoner but you see now the problem
[1:31:03] is he says this here and and and I'm
[1:31:05] going to kind of wind up soon but he
[1:31:06] says see just like you if you're a
[1:31:08] Christian God Don't Make Any halfway
[1:31:10] Christians God makes complete Christians
[1:31:13] amen God Don't Make halfway preachers
[1:31:15] but the preacher can be halfway am mean
[1:31:18] and God makes his children Christians
[1:31:20] but sometimes they're Halfway Christian
[1:31:22] but it's not God's intention for them to
[1:31:24] be that way it's their own ways got
[1:31:26] mixed up with the plan of God for their
[1:31:28] life and that's what makes them the way
[1:31:30] they are amen so you inject your own
[1:31:32] plans into God's will for you you become
[1:31:34] a Halfway Christian amen but God Don't
[1:31:37] Make halfway Christians I mean I don't
[1:31:38] believe I'm looking at halfway
[1:31:39] Christians but we must be very careful
[1:31:42] not to mix our own carnality into
[1:31:44] especially spiritual things and say it's
[1:31:46] God leading no we should have full
[1:31:48] confidence what God has told us he will
[1:31:51] fulfill
[1:31:52] amen not us fulfilling it he will
[1:31:54] fulfill we're surrendered to the word of
[1:31:56] God he will fulfill that word amen it's
[1:31:59] not God doesn't say go do this and says
[1:32:01] now you work it out yeah this is not
[1:32:03] like you got to assemble some piece of
[1:32:05] furniture without the instructions now
[1:32:07] some people try that that's fine it
[1:32:08] makes it more exciting but when it comes
[1:32:10] to Christianity you need the
[1:32:13] instructions amen you need the
[1:32:14] instruction say God build me into a
[1:32:17] Powerhouse of your Holy Ghost where I'm
[1:32:19] now a living dwelling place for the the
[1:32:21] Living God amen amen God don't want them
[1:32:24] to be halfway Christians or halfway
[1:32:26] preachers compromising on either side he
[1:32:28] wants them completely stand in the
[1:32:30] breach now Moses God had made him a
[1:32:32] complete Prophet for a complete
[1:32:34] deliverance and Moses was completely
[1:32:36] surrendered to the hands of God that's
[1:32:38] the reason it made him what he was amen
[1:32:41] he was so complete in God till God could
[1:32:43] trust him amen I believe God has made a
[1:32:46] complete bride I mean not a halfway
[1:32:48] bride not just some girl he's flirting
[1:32:49] with but his wife amen this word has
[1:32:52] come to unite Us by the Holy Ghost to
[1:32:55] himself I me so I believe I'm not
[1:32:56] looking at a halfway bride I believe I'm
[1:32:58] looking at a complete bride of Christ
[1:33:01] amen full of the spirit washed in the
[1:33:02] blood Sanctified to his word loving him
[1:33:04] more than anything loving him in spite
[1:33:06] of trouble trials and heartaches who
[1:33:08] cares about those things just walk on
[1:33:09] with God we're going to have trouble
[1:33:11] we'll go through Bri prates we'll go up
[1:33:13] hills and valleys and all kind of
[1:33:14] trouble but God will lead you through
[1:33:17] and mean you've got to completely trust
[1:33:19] your guide amen you must Trust in the
[1:33:21] danger remember he's trained to help you
[1:33:24] in the danger amen see what if see see
[1:33:27] what if I was there with brother ataki
[1:33:28] we're going through the mangr and then
[1:33:30] halfway I'm like where are
[1:33:32] we okay let me take the tiller I'm going
[1:33:34] to drive the boat boy I'd still be stuck
[1:33:37] in Mangrove somewhere hunting mud crabs
[1:33:39] trying to live there in the Solomons
[1:33:42] that's what Christians do they get
[1:33:44] worried where am I what's going on okay
[1:33:46] I've got to take the reins of my heart
[1:33:48] now my human mind to make everything
[1:33:50] work no that's the time to trust God
[1:33:52] that's the time to really let go and say
[1:33:54] God you lead me
[1:33:56] through amen you lead me through God but
[1:34:00] you see what happens is people have a s
[1:34:02] nature that must die see Saul was told
[1:34:05] by by by the prophet Samuel wait there
[1:34:07] for seven days in gilgal and I will come
[1:34:11] and I will give the sacrifice before you
[1:34:13] go fight the Philistines so so he
[1:34:15] received a word from the Lord and that
[1:34:17] comes to the seventh day he sees people
[1:34:19] are beginning to leave him he what is he
[1:34:21] he caught up in the five senses he's
[1:34:23] caught up in what he's imagining while
[1:34:25] the people are scattering from me we're
[1:34:26] getting less and less men we're going to
[1:34:28] lose the battle and and and Samuel's not
[1:34:30] coming Samuel's right on time amen Jesus
[1:34:33] is never late I mean we may think he's
[1:34:35] late but he's right on time his schedule
[1:34:37] is perfect amen so then what does he do
[1:34:39] he takes the Commandment of the Lord
[1:34:41] there's going to be a burnt offering and
[1:34:43] he takes it into his own hands and he
[1:34:45] gives the burnt offering see this is not
[1:34:47] good character this is bad character
[1:34:49] because this is man taking the plan of
[1:34:51] God into their own hands to fulfill it
[1:34:54] instead of just letting instead of
[1:34:55] waiting for Samuel to come and do it see
[1:34:58] as soon as he finishes the soon as he
[1:35:00] finishes it then what he made an end to
[1:35:03] of the offering the burnt offering
[1:35:04] behold Samuel came and Saul went out to
[1:35:06] meet him maybe the Smoke's just there he
[1:35:08] hear Samuel coming maybe runs to him to
[1:35:09] try how you doing you know nothing
[1:35:12] everything's fine yeah try you know how
[1:35:15] people do run from the
[1:35:17] evidence that's bad character see if he
[1:35:21] really had a good Godly character he
[1:35:22] would have waited why cuz maybe to me it
[1:35:26] would have been this offering would have
[1:35:27] been meant to be given at the evening
[1:35:29] time hey victory comes in the evening
[1:35:32] time amen you go do a study on that it's
[1:35:35] it's it's it's real nice amen the Lord
[1:35:38] amen
[1:35:39] so this is why we've got to if we want
[1:35:43] to see God move in a greater way cuz I
[1:35:45] believe we've just seen the cusp of his
[1:35:47] power I sincerely believe we've just
[1:35:49] kind of just seen a little bit of
[1:35:52] it this ain't plateauing friends this is
[1:35:55] not denomination where it's just yay no
[1:35:57] this's a full restoration of the world
[1:36:00] Amen so I believe we can you know I
[1:36:02] believe God is going to do the
[1:36:03] exceedingly abundantly more than we
[1:36:05] could ask or think that's right amen but
[1:36:07] you see now we must have a Heart of Love
[1:36:10] see that's why I've been stressing
[1:36:11] before I left love the Lord Praise Him
[1:36:13] in the trials Praise Him in the storm
[1:36:16] Praise Him and watch the chains break I
[1:36:18] mean just love him no matter what
[1:36:20] because in the message why so tossed
[1:36:22] about the brother could being put on the
[1:36:24] WhatsApp I could probably put the whole
[1:36:25] sermon here but it's only one slide it
[1:36:27] says but every but evil spirits not cast
[1:36:29] out by cruel indifferent living what is
[1:36:33] really that indifferent living mixing
[1:36:35] your own Humanity in with the word of
[1:36:38] God the most powerful weapon there is in
[1:36:41] the world is love amen amen so so you
[1:36:45] got to we have to walk in the love of
[1:36:47] God more than anything this world is
[1:36:49] very indifferent especially this
[1:36:51] country very lukewarm country this is
[1:36:54] this is lukewarm Ville but God put us in
[1:36:57] lukewarm Ville as a testimony Amen to
[1:37:00] prove to the devil it doesn't matter
[1:37:02] what you give them you can give them
[1:37:03] first world Comforts there's a people
[1:37:05] that love me amen there's a people that
[1:37:07] worship me they walk with me amen it
[1:37:10] doesn't matter where this Satan's Eden
[1:37:12] hey God has made a people that was a
[1:37:13] complete bride that will walk in this in
[1:37:15] this time amen soise the Lord amen you
[1:37:19] see it's not with money that God Works
[1:37:21] he moves by his spirit and that moving
[1:37:23] of the spirit comes only to a life
[1:37:25] consecrated to the word what is that
[1:37:27] you're a complete Christian you're not
[1:37:28] injecting your own thoughts in you let
[1:37:30] God lead you amen amen but you see now
[1:37:32] in the lat here and age I'm just kind of
[1:37:34] throwing these things out there then
[1:37:35] we'll then we'll finish see see the
[1:37:37] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:37:39] God it is its own mouthpiece this is
[1:37:41] where the the Lord says that because
[1:37:43] you're lukewarm I'll spew the out of my
[1:37:45] mouth now we're never in his mouth in
[1:37:47] terms of you know we're not abiding
[1:37:49] there we're in his heart and his hands
[1:37:51] in his mind but what his word is in his
[1:37:54] mouth amen but you see the church world
[1:37:57] has mixed Creeds and dogmas with the
[1:37:58] word so they're no longer speaking the
[1:38:00] word of God they're speak they're their
[1:38:02] own
[1:38:02] mouthpiece what have they done mix
[1:38:04] carnality in with the word how do we
[1:38:06] know how does God no longer speak
[1:38:08] through a Believer they mix their own
[1:38:11] Humanity with the word and they speak
[1:38:14] for themselves their desire is exalted
[1:38:17] and God's desire is put to the side am
[1:38:19] mean but if you want to be the mouth PE
[1:38:21] you want to see the voice of God in you
[1:38:23] amen speaking and doing what he wants to
[1:38:25] do let him have preeminence let him lead
[1:38:29] you let him be king I mean let him be
[1:38:31] Lord of lords in your life don't don't
[1:38:33] try and say well I can do it now I know
[1:38:35] what I'm doing no no he knows what he's
[1:38:38] doing
[1:38:40] amen hallelujah I'm just trying to find
[1:38:43] see the Apostle Paul as I said in the
[1:38:45] beginning he was a prisoner to Jesus
[1:38:47] Christ amen and he was forbidden by the
[1:38:51] Spirit to go certain places to
[1:38:53] preach amen but God he had to sacrifice
[1:38:58] every bit of his of his phariseeism to
[1:39:00] be United with the word and he says that
[1:39:03] he became a prisoner and brother says oh
[1:39:05] if people half spiritual can pick that
[1:39:07] up see he was forbidden to do his own
[1:39:10] will
[1:39:12] amen let's just uh can we have the
[1:39:15] musicians please I'm just going to end
[1:39:16] there let's just softly land see the
[1:39:19] thing to do is to be true in your heart
[1:39:22] love the Lord with all your heart and
[1:39:24] just be thankful that God is marching on
[1:39:26] with us the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:39:28] Christ I mean you want to see you want
[1:39:30] to see things really spoken and you want
[1:39:32] to see that third pole manifested in
[1:39:34] your life love him amen love him more
[1:39:38] than anything lay aside the carnality
[1:39:40] lay aside the problems lay aside the you
[1:39:42] know the devil's reasoning and all these
[1:39:44] things just you say but you know because
[1:39:47] people some people have a have such a
[1:39:50] inferiority complex they want to prove
[1:39:52] to the world that they're a Christian
[1:39:54] now let God prove it amen let God prove
[1:39:56] it we're not here to prove anything
[1:39:58] God's here to prove his word amen he's
[1:40:01] just looking for a place to do it
[1:40:03] Hallelujah Here I Am Lord come prove
[1:40:05] your word in my life I've got no
[1:40:07] reputation to uphold I got nothing to
[1:40:09] prove to the world I got nothing to
[1:40:10] prove that I'm right and people are
[1:40:11] wrong no forget all that stuff let God
[1:40:14] be
[1:40:15] glorify amen so if you want to see I
[1:40:17] said you can't explain Supernatural
[1:40:19] things when you try and do it he told me
[1:40:21] you cause carnal comparison to rise you
[1:40:23] do it but it's just actual it'll do that
[1:40:25] it's a hindrance to the body of Christ
[1:40:27] you know what I mean it causes conflict
[1:40:29] now the thing to do is to be true in
[1:40:31] your heart love the Lord with all your
