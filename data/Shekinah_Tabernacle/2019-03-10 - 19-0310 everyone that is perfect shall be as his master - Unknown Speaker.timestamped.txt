[43:15] purpose Lord and I pray your word would
[43:17] come forth now father in Jesus Christ's
[43:20] name For Your Glory we ask these things
[43:22] Lord amen amen God bless you friends you
[43:25] may have your seats your seats this
[43:28] morning so I want to take a thought if I
[43:30] can just just from that first scripture
[43:33] we read the disciple is not a Brother's
[43:37] Master but everyone that is perfect
[43:39] shall be as his
[43:40] master now the you know we live in a in
[43:44] a day and oh I was just marveling just
[43:46] you you read this to to um read this
[43:50] last night um after dinner and you know
[43:53] the so so I want to take a subject about
[43:56] you know everyone one that is perfect
[43:58] shall be as his master and that word uh
[44:02] perfect uh means to be to be complete
[44:05] thoroughly that is to be repaired that
[44:07] is to be mended framed made perfectly
[44:10] joined together to be restored amen and
[44:13] we know that now we're living in a day
[44:15] where where Redemption is coming to its
[44:17] climax where people you know we are not
[44:20] just Sinners saved by grace amen we are
[44:23] not just Sinners saved by grace amen but
[44:26] we are the red ones of the ages I mean
[44:28] we're the apple of his eye I mean we're
[44:30] not downtrod in Christians trying to
[44:32] survive this this world we're Overcomers
[44:34] in this age amen that our Lord doesn't
[44:37] just want us to be under under he
[44:40] doesn't want us to be second class
[44:42] citizens in the Kingdom but the Bible
[44:44] says we are joint ears that means he
[44:47] this is us this is him he lifts us up to
[44:49] where he is amen that we are on level
[44:53] filled with him Hallelujah that's what
[44:57] that's what God has ordained us to be
[45:00] Hallelujah so I want to take um I want
[45:02] to take this and I want to take it in
[45:04] the context of Rahab uh because you know
[45:07] the devil wants us to shut up he wants
[45:09] us to quit believing he wants us to give
[45:11] up amen but we're not called to shut up
[45:13] give up or quit I mean we're called to
[45:16] overcome we're called to that he would
[45:17] the Lord would live amen we are called
[45:20] not to bow to the pressure of this age
[45:22] amen or the pressure of man but we're
[45:24] called to
[45:25] overcome Hallelujah so now it says here
[45:28] that the um let's go here so it says in
[45:31] in in Romans 8 and
[45:34] 23 that not only they that speaking of
[45:37] creation is groaning waiting for the
[45:39] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[45:41] for for the Sons and Daughters of God to
[45:43] be manifested amen creation is waiting
[45:46] amen amen for for us to take our
[45:49] position and not only they but ourselves
[45:53] also which have the first fruits of the
[45:55] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[45:58] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[46:01] the Redemption of our body so there's
[46:04] something I trust within you today amen
[46:06] something that's groaning you wanting
[46:08] you want to be clothed with immortality
[46:09] you're not comfortable Amen in this life
[46:12] and not and it's not because the world
[46:13] is getting bad it's because you have a
[46:15] Heavenly home you want to be in amen you
[46:18] want to see the Lord amen face to face
[46:20] you want to be gathered around the
[46:21] strong you want to worship him I mean
[46:23] you don't want to be limited with by
[46:25] this body in any way you want to be in
[46:27] heaven with him I trust that's that's
[46:29] that's the core of your heart hallelujah
[46:32] amen so there's waiting for the adoption
[46:34] to with the Redemption of our body where
[46:36] our bodies are changed amen will there
[46:37] be a change in these atoms Hallelujah
[46:40] that's that's what we're waiting for and
[46:42] I was I I I was trembling a bit really
[46:44] when I was reading this last night I was
[46:46] thinking Lord we you know the Romans
[46:50] maybe no doubt thought you know well the
[46:52] you know the ones that Paul wrote this
[46:53] letter to and they took the letter and
[46:55] they you know read it for the first time
[46:57] no that they would have thought this is
[46:59] going to be us and in a way it will be
[47:01] because the dead in Christ still raised
[47:03] but we but but the promise was was was
[47:06] for today amen the Redemption of the
[47:09] body with there are people which are
[47:11] alive amen as everyone here today is
[47:14] everyone awake are you listening are you
[47:17] listening to God wants to get something
[47:19] to you Hallelujah we don't just want to
[47:22] sit casually and and let this go by am
[47:24] mean many people walked past Jesus when
[47:27] the woman had the blood issue but she
[47:28] knew it was more than a man walking past
[47:31] causing a disturbance she knew it was
[47:33] the son of man she knew it was the
[47:34] Messiah and she knew if I can just touch
[47:36] the him of His Garment I'll be made
[47:38] whole hallelujah how much more a service
[47:41] where God comes down God meets with us
[47:43] i' say Lord I'm going to grab I'm going
[47:46] to not just touch I'm going to grab your
[47:47] garment amen that you must change me you
[47:50] must make me into your image I don't
[47:51] want to sit still and be the same person
[47:54] Hallelujah I would respond to I you
[47:57] friends it's worth
[47:59] it Jesus is here right now he's here to
[48:03] meet your need to set the captive free
[48:07] Jesus is here right now but you've got
[48:10] to reach up and say Yes Lord I want to
[48:13] touch your garment you're here for mej I
[48:17] don't know about the person next to me
[48:18] but you're here for me you're here to
[48:20] minister to me you here to speak to me
[48:23] but you've got to
[48:24] respond amen so we living in the day of
[48:27] the change of the body brother B says a
[48:29] sweep will come over us there be a
[48:31] change in these atoms and before you
[48:33] even realize it you'll be in your
[48:34] glorified form
[48:37] Hallelujah
[48:38] now I don't know who said this but I
[48:41] think it stands
[48:42] quoting for anything to to go to a
[48:46] higher form it needs a greater one to
[48:48] come down and reach down and lift it up
[48:51] am mean you even even take the elements
[48:53] of this
[48:54] world right like lifeless dust dirt it's
[48:58] just there it can't become life it can't
[49:01] become part of life without plants
[49:04] absorbing it pulling it into itself and
[49:07] now it's part of a living being but
[49:10] that's just botney life it can't go any
[49:12] higher by itself we don't believe in
[49:15] evolution amen Darwin had a few ideas
[49:18] right but he didn't see the whole
[49:21] picture amen I studied Evolution at
[49:25] University I know what I'm talking about
[49:27] the laws of chemistry actually forbid it
[49:30] happening the laws of basic chemistry
[49:32] stop it happening but they're not
[49:34] willing to go that far because they
[49:36] believe they have to have faith that's
[49:38] right amen amen they have to have a lot
[49:41] of faith because it doesn't prove itself
[49:44] this word proves itself this word
[49:47] manifests what it says it is hallelujah
[49:49] we don't need to have we don't have
[49:50] Blind Faith we have real Faith
[49:53] Hallelujah that's right so now you take
[49:55] a PL that can only you know so so those
[49:57] elements that were in the dirt have been
[49:58] absorbed into the plant but it can't go
[50:00] any higher it takes a part of animal
[50:02] life like a cow comes along eats some
[50:04] grass now the grass becomes part of the
[50:06] cow it's now animal life but it can't
[50:09] become any higher it's now just part of
[50:10] the cow but then a man can come along
[50:12] kill the cow and eat it and now it's
[50:15] become part it was but it was the D dirt
[50:17] now it's a plant then it becomes a cow
[50:20] now it's part of a human but it can't go
[50:22] any higher by itself it needs someone
[50:24] greater to come down I mean the quick
[50:26] those atoms I mean to Chang them just
[50:28] from dirt to you could say Eternal dirt
[50:31] you're following me it takes one greater
[50:34] takes one greater than ourselves to
[50:36] reach down his hands Lift us up amen
[50:40] that's why when people say I've got it
[50:41] all sorted that's one thing you should
[50:43] know you don't have nothing sorted it
[50:45] takes him to come and sort it hallelujah
[50:48] hallelujah so it takes they must take
[50:50] one greater than man must be God that
[50:52] reaches down to transform that person's
[50:54] atoms Hallelujah I'm glad we have a
[50:57] message of
[50:58] transformation Hallelujah I made the
[51:01] comment on Sunday about the Old
[51:03] Testament as a shadow of the new which
[51:04] we know that is exactly right and namely
[51:07] that the lives of the Believers of the
[51:09] Old Testament are a shadow of you they
[51:13] point to the reality and the shadow
[51:17] won't produce something that's different
[51:18] to the reality so as I said you can have
[51:20] a shadow of a hand on a wall and as the
[51:23] hand comes closer that you don't see the
[51:25] shadow no more and you you know you see
[51:28] the hand it doesn't suddenly become a
[51:29] flipper or a tentacle it'll be a hand
[51:32] because it looks like the shadow looks
[51:33] like the hand right so you won't see
[51:35] anything that's you know it'll be the
[51:38] same thing but in a greater form
[51:41] Hallelujah
[51:42] so the shadow will be what it's de I
[51:45] mean the reality will be what the shadow
[51:47] is declaring now when we look into the
[51:50] scripture Redemption by marriage
[51:54] Redemption by Union amen is a principal
[51:57] theme of the scripture amen hallelujah
[51:59] amen and so I just want to take I want
[52:02] to take um Rahab and Salone for this
[52:05] context because we know that Rahab and
[52:08] Salomon coming together is a story of
[52:11] redemption now but before I go into this
[52:14] I've said all this because he says now
[52:16] but everyone that is perfect shall be as
[52:19] his
[52:20] master now in order for a disciple or a
[52:25] student to be become as their Master is
[52:28] there has to be a change in
[52:31] relationship right a pupil or a disciple
[52:34] you have the teacher the master you have
[52:36] the pupil they'll always be like this
[52:40] but there has to be a change in the
[52:41] relationship for them to become the
[52:43] same amen and we know that the only way
[52:47] we can become perfect as as Jesus said
[52:49] be ye
[52:50] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[52:53] perfect the only way that we can become
[52:56] that way is that the perfect one himself
[52:59] comes and joins himself to you that's
[53:01] the only way you can become perfect amen
[53:04] you can have all the self-help books all
[53:06] you want that's just that's just like a
[53:08] veneer it doesn't change the core of
[53:11] your being it doesn't help you no but
[53:13] you need the perfect one to come and
[53:15] join himself to you that's right are you
[53:18] following me oh and I trust you should
[53:20] be able to say he already has Hallelujah
[53:23] he already has joined himself to me
[53:26] thank so just Rejoice the rest of the
[53:28] service and the rest of your life
[53:30] hallelujah amen he says be so he's
[53:33] saying that the that everyone that is
[53:36] perfect shall be as his master is it's
[53:38] only when the master and the disciple
[53:41] change relationship and they become one
[53:45] then the then the then the disciple will
[53:47] be as his
[53:48] master
[53:50] hallelujah amen who is our Master our
[53:54] Master is not a Bible School our Master
[53:56] is not me I'd say our Master is not
[53:59] William brandham our Master is the Lord
[54:01] Jesus Christ The Living Word right Jesus
[54:05] Christ who died on Calvary who rose
[54:07] again sent forth the spirit into the
[54:09] church he is our Master he is his word
[54:12] am mean we don't bow to no headquarters
[54:14] upon this Earth we have a headquarters
[54:16] in heaven amen and our chief Captain is
[54:19] the Lord Jesus Christ his word
[54:21] hallelujah that is our
[54:23] Master amen but it depends but who is
[54:26] well I could say that is my master but
[54:28] who is your master because the one you
[54:30] give your time to give service to
[54:32] rearrange your life that that thing
[54:34] takes preeminence that's your master
[54:36] whether it be a hobby or a job or
[54:38] whatever it may be sure we have to give
[54:41] time to work you you but if you say well
[54:44] no I can't do this I can't you know if
[54:47] your whole life what is your life
[54:48] revolving around I want you to think
[54:50] about I want God to come and speak to
[54:52] you amen cuz that thing is your master
[54:54] and that's what you shall become
[54:57] I want I want the Lord to be my master
[54:59] all other things are
[55:02] vain
[55:03] now let's go
[55:06] to Genesis
[55:08] 17 because as Jesus said be
[55:12] perfect um even as your father in Heaven
[55:15] is
[55:16] perfect God comes down to Abraham or
[55:21] Abraham and he says and when Abraham was
[55:23] 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared
[55:27] to
[55:28] Abraham and said I am the almighty God
[55:32] walk before me and be thou perfect he's
[55:35] telling a man you walk before me you be
[55:37] perfect and I'll make a covenant between
[55:39] me and thee and I'll M multiply thee
[55:43] exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face
[55:46] and God talked with him saying as for me
[55:49] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[55:52] shall be a father of many nations
[55:55] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[55:57] Abraham but thy name shall be Abraham
[56:01] for a father of many nations have I made
[56:04] thee and I will make thee exceedingly
[56:08] fruitful and I will make make nations of
[56:10] thee and Kings shall come out of thee so
[56:15] here we have God is commanding AB
[56:17] Abraham to walk before him and be
[56:20] perfect but notice now in order for this
[56:23] to happen God comes to him and says I
[56:25] will make a covenant between me and thee
[56:28] so now God is actually investing himself
[56:31] he is joining himself to Abraham that he
[56:34] can walk before him and be perfect are
[56:36] you all following me you know all the
[56:39] pressure is on God if you have fully
[56:42] given your life to him you are his
[56:45] responsibility he will take care of you
[56:48] if you cast all your cares upon him
[56:50] because he cares for you am mean we have
[56:52] to come to a place it's not you it's him
[56:55] right he he is the one that will look
[56:57] after you he is the one that will guide
[56:59] you he is the one who will keep you he
[57:00] is the one who will counsel you amen he
[57:03] is the one who will guide you into a
[57:04] Rapture he is the one who will defend
[57:06] you he is the one who will fight for you
[57:08] he is the one who will protect you he
[57:10] will do it it's not ourselves doing it
[57:13] amen but he is doing you must come to
[57:15] that realization I cannot fight my own
[57:17] battles I cannot stand on My Own
[57:19] Strength amen but he will stand for me
[57:23] hallelujah hallelujah amen that's what
[57:25] we're going when all to stand stand you
[57:27] may feel defeated but stand say Lord
[57:30] here I am I'm depending on you that you
[57:32] will keep me
[57:33] standing Hallelujah we have to come to
[57:36] that realization amen when we are
[57:38] gathered around the throne it will not
[57:40] be well yes I did a bit too Lord that's
[57:42] why I'm here no it'll be Lord you did it
[57:44] all for me you called me your goodness
[57:47] led me to repentance Hallelujah your
[57:49] goodness brought me to baptism in the
[57:51] name of Jesus Christ your goodness led
[57:53] me to surrender my entire life there's
[57:55] no part of me that I've kept myself your
[57:58] goodness filled me with your spirit amen
[58:00] your goodness led me to be amen into a
[58:02] body change hallelujah
[58:05] hallelujah salvation is of the
[58:08] Lord not of
[58:10] man that's why we but we have to keep
[58:12] that
[58:13] confidence Hallelujah so now here's
[58:17] so God says to him I'll make a covenant
[58:20] with thee so God is uniting himself
[58:23] uniting himself with Abraham but notice
[58:25] now now when when when this takes place
[58:28] God changes his name from Abraham to
[58:30] Abraham and we know when the when when a
[58:33] name is changed in the Bible it it
[58:35] represents a change of life they're now
[58:37] going to live a different life amen you
[58:40] see you see Abraham it means High father
[58:43] but now he's going to live a different
[58:44] kind of Life he's going to be a father
[58:46] of Nations and he became a father of
[58:48] Nations just like Sarah I don't know if
[58:50] we have this on
[58:52] here no we don't have it there but you
[58:55] know Sarai which means dominative is her
[58:59] name is changed to Sarah which is
[59:01] Princess amen so now she is changed her
[59:05] life has changed Jacob was supplanter
[59:08] but his name was changed after he
[59:10] wrestled with God to Israel Prince with
[59:12] God Amen because he began to live a
[59:14] different kind of life now you know the
[59:16] name Saul was good for a king but didn't
[59:18] do no good for an apostle for the first
[59:19] church a mistress whose name was changed
[59:21] to Paul amen because now a different
[59:23] life was being was being lived out amen
[59:26] amen and even when God changes the
[59:28] titles of people he's showing now I'm
[59:30] going to change because whenever a name
[59:32] is changed the relationship with God and
[59:34] the and the person is changing amen just
[59:37] like Abraham now he said God I'm going
[59:39] to join myself with you amen so now our
[59:41] relationship's changing I called you but
[59:44] now I'm going to become one with you by
[59:45] this Covenant that I am making with you
[59:48] hallelujah amen now brother Braham says
[59:51] in the in the first
[59:52] seal he says this he says now notice the
[59:55] first seal seal I'm just going to read
[59:56] this but but um it's really the last but
[59:58] I want to get to but he says notice the
[1:00:00] first seal opened the first seal when it
[1:00:02] was opened in the symbol form thundered
[1:00:05] now what about when it's opened in
[1:00:07] reality form it thundered as soon as a
[1:00:09] lamb struck back the seal what did it
[1:00:11] reveal not all of itself first it was
[1:00:14] with God next it was an assemble then
[1:00:16] it's revealed three things see it's
[1:00:17] coming forth from the throne first it
[1:00:20] can't be seen heard or nothing it sealed
[1:00:22] up the Lamb's blood paid the price it
[1:00:24] thundered when he spoke it out and when
[1:00:27] he did a white horse rider started out
[1:00:29] it was still a symbol now what he said
[1:00:31] it would be known in the last day but it
[1:00:33] comes forth in a church symbol do you
[1:00:35] understand it Church it comes forth in a
[1:00:38] symbol of a church that they know there
[1:00:40] is a seal but just what it is yet they
[1:00:43] don't know because it's a white horse
[1:00:45] rider and it only is to be revealed in
[1:00:47] the last day when this actual seal is
[1:00:50] broken broken to who not to Christ but
[1:00:53] to the church now notice he says oh my
[1:00:55] it makes me
[1:00:56] I hope that the church truly understands
[1:00:58] it see what it means you people I'm
[1:01:01] going to call you bride see that you'll
[1:01:04] understand it the voice is of Thunder
[1:01:07] The Voice came from where from the
[1:01:09] throne where the lamb had just left his
[1:01:11] intercessor so he's saying no I'm not
[1:01:12] going to call you a church no more I'm
[1:01:14] going to call you bride that you'll
[1:01:15] understand what's going on why because
[1:01:17] the second part of redemption is
[1:01:19] unfolding and where it's not just a
[1:01:20] purchase but now it's a claiming work
[1:01:23] that's what this message does it's the
[1:01:24] word of God coming to claim you amen cuz
[1:01:27] you're part of that word you're part of
[1:01:29] his inheritance amen so that's why it's
[1:01:31] now I'm going to call you bride because
[1:01:33] the prophet messenger God is speaking
[1:01:35] through him saying now we're going to
[1:01:37] have a change of relationship amen amen
[1:01:40] hallelujah I'm going to call you bride
[1:01:42] now amen because we know the bride
[1:01:45] doesn't go through the tribulation
[1:01:47] there's no way that God would thoroughly
[1:01:48] purger of all their sins on Calvary and
[1:01:51] then send her through the Great
[1:01:52] Tribulation to be purged more no the
[1:01:54] blood of Jesus Christ fully purged is
[1:01:56] the bride he took our tribulation on
[1:01:58] Calvary amen we don't need any
[1:02:00] tribulation he took it on the cross he
[1:02:02] paid it all am mean he took our judgment
[1:02:05] he took our punishment amen that day on
[1:02:07] Calvary so we don't need to go through
[1:02:10] because but the church has to because
[1:02:12] she's not thoroughly cleansed because
[1:02:14] she hasn't taken the whole word of
[1:02:16] God hallelujah am that's to me I'm glad
[1:02:19] I'm not going in the
[1:02:21] tribulation amen so that's why now we
[1:02:24] are called bride that you'll understand
[1:02:27] yes sir so now as I said the disciple
[1:02:29] well as we read the disciple is not
[1:02:31] above his master and a disciple is a
[1:02:33] student now a student teacher
[1:02:36] relationship uh uh in that the teacher
[1:02:39] will always be greater in understanding
[1:02:41] than the student but the identity and
[1:02:44] the identity of the student and teacher
[1:02:46] are different right but then now when
[1:02:49] the if the relationship changes and the
[1:02:52] teacher marries the student then the
[1:02:54] student's identity is wrapped wrapped up
[1:02:56] in the teacher you following me they
[1:02:59] lose their identity Hallelujah I don't
[1:03:02] have my own identity my identity is in
[1:03:05] him the word amen hallelujah now Jesus
[1:03:10] said Jesus spoke about us being one with
[1:03:15] him he says neither pray I for these
[1:03:19] alone but for them also which Shall
[1:03:22] Believe on me through their word so
[1:03:25] Jesus prayed for you I'm glad I'm glad
[1:03:29] God became flesh and prayed for me
[1:03:32] Hallelujah that they may all be one as
[1:03:35] thou father art in me and I in thee and
[1:03:38] they also may be one in us that the
[1:03:41] world may believe that thou has sent me
[1:03:44] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[1:03:47] gave I have given them that they they
[1:03:50] may be one even as we are one i in them
[1:03:54] and thou and me that thou that they may
[1:03:57] be perfect and one that the world may
[1:04:00] know that thou Hast sent me and H has
[1:04:02] loved them and thou loved
[1:04:07] me father I will that they also whom
[1:04:11] thou Hast given me be with me where I am
[1:04:15] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:04:17] Hast given me for thou lovest me before
[1:04:20] the foundation of the world oh righteous
[1:04:22] father the world hath not known thee but
[1:04:26] I have known thee and these have known
[1:04:29] uh sorry and these have known that thou
[1:04:31] Hast sent me and I have declared unto
[1:04:34] them thy name and will declare it that
[1:04:37] the love where thou Hast loved me may be
[1:04:40] in them and I am them now notice he says
[1:04:45] here that we would be they would be one
[1:04:48] even as I that they all may be one as
[1:04:51] thou father art me and I in thee so in
[1:04:54] order to be one
[1:04:56] we have to be one with the Lord that's
[1:04:58] that's he's praying that they we would
[1:05:00] become one as he because Jesus came to a
[1:05:04] place you know um well before I say that
[1:05:08] Jesus is not saying that we'd just be
[1:05:10] one big happy group Christendom would be
[1:05:12] one big happy group that's not the
[1:05:14] Oneness he's talking about he's talking
[1:05:15] about the Oneness he's talking about is
[1:05:16] that we would be one us and God would be
[1:05:19] one as he and the father were one okay
[1:05:23] are you following me amen because it's
[1:05:25] really Oneness brings the Perfection as
[1:05:29] I said it's the
[1:05:30] Union right that brings forth the
[1:05:33] Perfection amen are you all following me
[1:05:36] I hope this is not I don't believe this
[1:05:37] is mental gymnastics amen because our
[1:05:40] identity is in him right and if you're
[1:05:42] one with him everything he is we become
[1:05:44] by his grace and everything I was is
[1:05:47] lost in him amen amen so so I'm not
[1:05:49] there anymore my identities is and my
[1:05:51] husband the word hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:53] so it's Oneness brings forth the prop
[1:05:56] ction now Jesus says here in John 10 I
[1:06:00] and my father are
[1:06:02] one then the Jews took up stones again
[1:06:04] to Stone him Jesus answered them and
[1:06:06] said many good works have I showed you
[1:06:08] from my father for which of those Works
[1:06:11] do you Stone me Jesus answered him
[1:06:13] saying for a good work I Stone thee not
[1:06:17] I mean for a good work we Stone thee not
[1:06:18] but for Blas for me and because thou
[1:06:21] being a man makest thyself God Jesus
[1:06:24] answered them is it not written in your
[1:06:26] law I have said ye are Gods if he called
[1:06:29] them Gods unto whom the word of God came
[1:06:31] and the scripture cannot sorry and the
[1:06:35] scripture cannot be broken so it's when
[1:06:38] Jesus he said so for his good works the
[1:06:41] Jews didn't want to Stone him for his
[1:06:42] good works they didn't want to Stone him
[1:06:44] for Healing The Sick raising the dead
[1:06:47] feeding the multitude amen but it was
[1:06:49] when he came to a place where he said I
[1:06:51] and my father are one when you see me
[1:06:54] you've seen the father
[1:06:56] am mean that's where the Jews the
[1:06:57] religious crowd got angry because they
[1:07:00] could not handle that God would become
[1:07:01] flesh in a man and it's always it's
[1:07:04] never the it wasn't the idea of the
[1:07:06] Messiah that was offensive amen the
[1:07:08] scribes and Pharisees they would have
[1:07:10] sat round amen and said you know they
[1:07:12] would have talked about the Messiah and
[1:07:13] they would have said what he would have
[1:07:15] done and all those things so the idea
[1:07:16] was not offensive a virgin conceiving
[1:07:19] the idea of it wasn't offensive it was
[1:07:21] in the scripture but when the angel came
[1:07:24] to Mary and and when she began to
[1:07:26] testify I was walking down a narrow
[1:07:29] passageway and man about 6ot complexion
[1:07:32] shoulder you know length here spoke to
[1:07:34] me and there was a presence around him
[1:07:36] and said Mary Thou Art highly beloved
[1:07:38] among favored among women and he began
[1:07:41] to speak to me and it was words like I
[1:07:43] never heard before and and and I was
[1:07:45] troubled in there and he said Be not
[1:07:47] Afraid amen you know the story
[1:07:49] Hallelujah and and and you know he said
[1:07:52] that you'll you'll be with child and and
[1:07:54] she said how can this be I I wasn't
[1:07:57] married I never known a man and then
[1:07:59] this this angel said to me that thou
[1:08:01] shalt have a child by the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:04] he shall be the son of the highest
[1:08:05] Hallelujah and his name Shall be Called
[1:08:07] Jesus I'm just paraphrasing but I trust
[1:08:09] you all know the story right and then
[1:08:11] she began to testify about that the idea
[1:08:15] of a virgin conceiving wasn't offensive
[1:08:17] but when it put on flesh when the
[1:08:19] prophecy became flesh it was offensive
[1:08:22] and it gave her a black name you go
[1:08:24] reading his
[1:08:26] they believe it was a soldier that made
[1:08:28] her pregnant and Joseph just covered it
[1:08:30] up that's an official history why cuz
[1:08:33] the devil puts it in there to try and
[1:08:34] put a black mark against Jesus being
[1:08:36] born it wasn't a soldier it was God
[1:08:39] created amen Jesus in her womb
[1:08:42] Hallelujah Emanuel came forth but it was
[1:08:45] a but it became offensive when it put on
[1:08:49] flesh the Forerunner coming John the
[1:08:51] Baptist was not offensive in the
[1:08:53] scripture oh there's going to be a voice
[1:08:55] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:08:57] make the way straight for the Lord to
[1:08:58] come all the high places made Low Low
[1:09:00] Places made High Hallelujah would that
[1:09:02] be wonderful and then it put on flesh
[1:09:04] and then he be be to call a bunch of
[1:09:06] Snakes in the Grass and New Generation
[1:09:08] of Vipers and all these things it became
[1:09:10] offensive because the prophecy put on
[1:09:13] flesh Hallelujah and it's the same thing
[1:09:16] today I'm just going to Leap Forward
[1:09:17] today it's when the word puts on flesh
[1:09:20] the idea of a bride is not offensive the
[1:09:23] idea of the bride of Christ is not
[1:09:24] offensive the idea of people going in
[1:09:26] the Rapture is not offensive amen but
[1:09:29] when it puts on flesh and when you begin
[1:09:33] to say I and my father are one amen
[1:09:36] that's when it becomes offensive to
[1:09:38] people that's when they pull back that's
[1:09:40] when they say no you've gone too far no
[1:09:41] it can't just be you how dare you say
[1:09:43] this you know no doubt of Noah's day it
[1:09:46] wouldn't just be Noah saying look how
[1:09:48] bad the world's
[1:09:49] getting there would have been other
[1:09:51] people that would have been
[1:09:53] grieved but when Noah said God spoke to
[1:09:58] me oh you think you're the only Holy One
[1:10:01] I don't you
[1:10:03] know all Noah could say is I don't know
[1:10:05] about that but all I know is God spoke
[1:10:07] to
[1:10:08] me who's our judge who's our judge is
[1:10:12] man our judge or God is our judge
[1:10:15] Hallelujah and so Noah Noah said all I
[1:10:17] know is God and they begin to build the
[1:10:19] boat and it became
[1:10:21] offensive what are you doing Noah I'm
[1:10:24] building a boat where's the water it's
[1:10:27] up
[1:10:29] there no it's not yeah it is God told me
[1:10:32] it's there are you sure how could this
[1:10:35] be and okay so what happens when the
[1:10:38] this water's going to come down it's
[1:10:40] going to flood the
[1:10:42] Earth okay water that's not there is
[1:10:44] going to cover this
[1:10:47] place and people laughed but he was
[1:10:51] serious and okay so what's got but I've
[1:10:54] got a boat too no no that won't work
[1:10:57] what do you mean it doesn't work I
[1:10:58] believe like you I believe in God just
[1:11:00] like you Noah no you got to get in this
[1:11:02] one and it became offensive how dare you
[1:11:05] say this is the only one door in animals
[1:11:09] I've got to get in that it doesn't look
[1:11:11] very big it won't fit that's not my kind
[1:11:13] of sea fearing it doesn't look like it's
[1:11:15] going to sail very well all I had to do
[1:11:18] is
[1:11:19] float that's all they had to do all they
[1:11:22] had to do was survive the
[1:11:24] destruction and when it was built it
[1:11:26] became offensive that's right amen and
[1:11:30] when the word becomes manifested it
[1:11:32] becomes offensive the scribes and
[1:11:34] Pharisees could debate it all the day
[1:11:36] long but when it became flesh it became
[1:11:40] offensive amen and it's the same thing
[1:11:42] with you and I friends people talk about
[1:11:44] a bride they talk about a Rapture they
[1:11:46] talk about whatever more but when it
[1:11:47] puts on flesh and you say this is the
[1:11:51] way it's
[1:11:53] offensive because the people have to
[1:11:55] have a decision will they bow to the
[1:11:57] word or will they throw it
[1:12:00] away amen
[1:12:03] now are we still going what's happened
[1:12:07] here here we
[1:12:09] go now this seed is not able to
[1:12:14] Shook and we'll come back to what I said
[1:12:16] before now they produced that that
[1:12:19] justification will save man you believe
[1:12:21] that sure it was a carrier is it there
[1:12:24] yes it's
[1:12:25] is it there yes sure it's a carrier of
[1:12:29] the word just the same as I believe the
[1:12:30] stalk is part of the wheat but it's a
[1:12:32] carrier it ain't the life then came
[1:12:34] along sanctification how many believes
[1:12:36] in sanctification you believe the Bible
[1:12:37] you have to sure so that's not it so
[1:12:40] there's uh there's little more like
[1:12:42] there's two more words but then come
[1:12:44] Pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[1:12:46] speaking in tongues they call it the
[1:12:47] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:49] speaking in tongues there they call it
[1:12:51] the initial evidence which brought forth
[1:12:52] what the shook but they denominated but
[1:12:55] when you come to
[1:12:57] say I and my father are one and these
[1:13:00] other things then the shook pulls away
[1:13:02] from it but the real genuine bride
[1:13:05] church will bring forth the entire word
[1:13:07] of God in its fullness and its strength
[1:13:11] for he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:14] forever amen so when you come to a place
[1:13:17] who has the holy ghost that means you
[1:13:20] and the father are one that means you
[1:13:23] have become one with God Hallelujah
[1:13:25] that's what it means if he dwells in you
[1:13:28] you can say I and my father are one
[1:13:32] hallelujah we're not two We Are One
[1:13:35] everything I am is in him my identity is
[1:13:38] in him my righteousness is in him

[1:31:44] sinless I'm as pure as God is
[1:31:47] pure really what what did did you
[1:31:51] understand what I just read it's in the
[1:31:53] Bible if you believe the Lord you
[1:31:55] believe the Bible right if you really
[1:31:58] believe it then you believe that you
[1:31:59] actually take him at his word he became
[1:32:01] me that I would become the very
[1:32:03] righteous of God in him Hallelujah that
[1:32:06] means I'm as pure as God is pure I'm as
[1:32:08] holy as God is Holy I'm as righteous as
[1:32:11] he is righteous that's right you say

[1:39:12] served its time see but it is the word
[1:39:14] Bride of the word groom Hallelujah that
[1:39:18] is now the time it's a word Bride of the
[1:39:20] word groom so as he is the word you are
[1:39:23] the
[1:39:25] word like marries like it's illegal for
[1:39:28] me to go marry a
[1:39:30] cat and even if I could you know you
[1:39:34] can't make cat human hybrid
[1:39:37] babies okay that doesn't work like
[1:39:40] Mary's like let what did God say in the
[1:39:43] beginning let everything bring forth
[1:39:45] after its own kind right so if God is
[1:39:49] going to have people upon the Earth what
[1:39:52] kind of people will they be they will be
[1:39:55] Godlike people they will be God people
[1:39:58] hallelujah just like all those you have
[1:40:00] children you look down even when the
[1:40:02] children are yay big and maybe a few
[1:40:04] minutes old you can look into them and
[1:40:06] say they look just like me and then you
[1:40:09] begin to find out whether you like it or
[1:40:10] not the characteristics of you and them
[1:40:13] and you see it's like you're looking in
[1:40:15] a
[1:40:16] mirror Allelujah good and bad and when
[1:40:19] God God has no bad characteristics in
[1:40:21] him so when he when he he brings forth
[1:40:24] children upon the earth when he brings
[1:40:26] forth his bride and he looks down at her
[1:40:28] he sees
[1:40:30] himself Hallelujah he sees himself in a
[1:40:32] people why because like marries like to
[1:40:35] bring forth
[1:40:37] like Hallelujah yes what who me yes
[1:40:41] you are you following me we got to
[1:40:45] listen just take this guy and his impact
[1:40:48] on your life put it to one side amen
[1:40:51] because we get so wrapped up in this
[1:40:52] thing this thing's going to be changed
[1:40:54] one day amen we shouldn't focus on this
[1:40:58] thing focus on him and this thing will
[1:41:00] be taken care of hallelujah
[1:41:04] amen I believe it he will take care of
[1:41:08] it amen so now like Mary's like so the
[1:41:11] word bride if if the groom is the word
[1:41:14] so the bride is the word now let's go
[1:41:16] very quickly to Rahab how does this have
[1:41:19] to do with Rahab Rahab was locked up in
[1:41:22] Jericho
[1:41:23] amen I'm just going to go real quickly
[1:41:25] through the story of Rahab because I've
[1:41:26] said all that just to come to Rahab
[1:41:28] Rahab was locked up in Jericho she was
[1:41:32] not part of the promise of God at all
[1:41:35] she was an enemy alien in the she was a
[1:41:38] squatter in the promised land right We
[1:41:42] Were Once Upon a Time the enemies of
[1:41:45] God Amen we were doesn't matter what
[1:41:48] family you're from you can trace your
[1:41:50] lineage back to Adam who cares you're
[1:41:52] still born born in sin shaped in
[1:41:55] iniquity come to World speaking lies
[1:41:58] okay so we're all born lost we need him
[1:42:00] to save us amen so Jer so Rahab was
[1:42:04] locked up in
[1:42:05] Jericho amen Jericho itself was sealed
[1:42:08] up and once upon part time we were
[1:42:10] locked up amen our first birth locked us
[1:42:13] up amen and and and that either
[1:42:16] manifested in religion denominational
[1:42:19] tombs of man's ideas or the world
[1:42:21] fulfilling the lust of the flesh but
[1:42:22] we're all sealed up in a in a city amen
[1:42:26] now but this is not what God had for us
[1:42:30] it says in Jeremiah
[1:42:32] 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I
[1:42:35] think towards you sayith the Lord
[1:42:37] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:42:40] give you an expected end now the
[1:42:42] Instagram version of that scripture is
[1:42:45] you know God just thinks nice thoughts
[1:42:47] thinking of you today and you not yeah I
[1:42:49] like you you know it's it's it's diluted
[1:42:52] down but the the real version of that
[1:42:54] scripture is far more powerful than just
[1:42:58] thinking nice thoughts because God
[1:43:00] doesn't have a new thought right God's
[1:43:03] thoughts have been declared he doesn't
[1:43:05] have a new thought Amen to what he
[1:43:07] thought about you before the foundation
[1:43:09] of the world right he cannot change his
[1:43:11] thinking he's made up his mind amen he's
[1:43:14] made up his mind he cannot deviate from
[1:43:16] how he thought about you doesn't matter
[1:43:18] about what we conceive or think we are
[1:43:20] it doesn't change his thinking amen
[1:43:23] because God's thoughts are not like
[1:43:25] man's thoughts man's thoughts change
[1:43:26] mine change a
[1:43:28] lot amen kids come to me can we do this
[1:43:31] well maybe you know cuz and that's
[1:43:34] probably very frustrating but God's
[1:43:36] thoughts I'm glad God is not like that
[1:43:39] right God's thoughts are already been
[1:43:42] made up he cannot change them amen he
[1:43:45] doesn't change his thoughts he cannot
[1:43:47] have a new thought what he has thought
[1:43:50] and declared it is so and shall ever be
[1:43:52] amen and we know that his thoughts are
[1:43:55] his word hallelujah so now so when he
[1:43:59] says that I have thoughts towards you
[1:44:01] says the Lord thoughts of Peace not eval
[1:44:04] to give you an expected end those
[1:44:06] thoughts towards you are what he's
[1:44:07] ordained you to become what he's
[1:44:10] ordained you to be amen that now so his
[1:44:13] thoughts towards us amen is that we
[1:44:15] would be made in His image we would
[1:44:17] become one with him am mean everything
[1:44:19] he is we become by his grace amen so his
[1:44:23] righteousness we become as righteous as
[1:44:25] he is as holy as he is as virtuous as he
[1:44:27] is as sinless as he is hallelujah amen
[1:44:31] we're Made In His Image we're joined to
[1:44:32] him that his sort that in 2000 and
[1:44:35] whenever you met the Lord Place a year
[1:44:37] there just say 2019 if it's this year or
[1:44:41] 2018 in 2007 he thought about me I well
[1:44:46] in two in
[1:44:47] 1985 men will be born upon the Earth he
[1:44:50] won't know
[1:44:52] me amen but in 2007 but I'll begin to
[1:44:55] brood over his life and I'll lead him
[1:44:57] down a path cuz he's got a thought
[1:44:59] towards me and that's been gathered
[1:45:01] around his throne redeemed that's his
[1:45:03] thought now he's like now I'm going to
[1:45:04] get them there so he has a predestinated
[1:45:06] path so 1985 I'll be born he won't know
[1:45:10] me he won't know where he came from but
[1:45:13] there'll come a time and I'll brw over
[1:45:15] him and in his heart I'll make it that
[1:45:17] he always wanted me maybe not really
[1:45:19] knowing where are you who was like that
[1:45:22] Hallelujah
[1:45:23] there's a longing and then then I'll brw
[1:45:26] over him but then in 2007 in
[1:45:29] September I'm going to meet
[1:45:31] him I'm going to reveal himself I'm
[1:45:34] going to reveal myself to him and God
[1:45:37] has ordained everything then finally I
[1:45:39] come down to that moment I meet the Lord
[1:45:42] hallelujah hallelujah and then I begin
[1:45:45] to see I'm not just from New Zealand and
[1:45:47] from Heaven Hallelujah that doesn't
[1:45:49] matter what happens in life he's in
[1:45:51] control he's brought me here and if he's
[1:45:54] brought me here he'll take me away from
[1:45:56] here
[1:45:57] hallelujah that's why he's here
[1:46:00] hallelujah that's his thought towards us
[1:46:03] his thought towards us is not based on
[1:46:05] how we are acting you know I may think
[1:46:08] nice things towards you because You' be
[1:46:11] nice to me that's human thought that's
[1:46:13] human thought oh brother kabin isn't he
[1:46:15] wonderful and he is wonderful amen but
[1:46:18] then no I can't even put this cuz
[1:46:20] brother K wouldn't do anything bad but
[1:46:21] you know but then what if us like oh
[1:46:22] brother
[1:46:23] then my thoughts are not so good because
[1:46:25] it's human thoughts but God's thoughts
[1:46:27] are not but that's based on what he does
[1:46:29] to me that's human thinking right but
[1:46:32] God's thinking doesn't change while we
[1:46:34] we were yet sinners he died and loved us
[1:46:37] while we we were his enemy he died for
[1:46:40] us hallelujah amen because he he had
[1:46:43] thoughts towards us that of peace that
[1:46:45] we had come to an expected end
[1:46:47] Hallelujah that expected end is redeemed
[1:46:49] around his throne hallelujah amen that's
[1:46:53] his s that's what we need to focus on
[1:46:55] Lord what do you think about me what
[1:46:57] have you declared about me in your word
[1:46:59] and focus upon that not what people
[1:47:02] think amen not what people think what
[1:47:05] does God say here is here is Mary coming
[1:47:09] into the temple and Joseph with Jesus 8
[1:47:11] days old to be dedicated whatever age he
[1:47:13] was all the other woman were bringing
[1:47:17] their woman uh children in there was a
[1:47:19] gap as here was a woman who was of ill
[1:47:21] Fame had a black name you the Jesus M

[1:47:28] sure that the word has a bad
[1:47:31] name he he makes real
[1:47:34] sure he you know he's very good at
[1:47:37] marketing he make sure that the word has
[1:47:40] a bad name but the you know you know the
[1:47:43] Apostle Paul comes to some Jews in the
[1:47:44] city in the book of Acts go find it

[1:48:02] and here's these woman with their babies
[1:48:04] coming for the baby to be dedicated or
[1:48:06] whatever they did and there's now
[1:48:08] they're keeping away because I want to
[1:48:09] be identified with her that's man's
[1:48:11] thoughts towards Jesus that's the
[1:48:12] devil's thoughts towards Jesus But Here
[1:48:15] Comes Simeon Here Comes God's thoughts
[1:48:18] God's thoughts come down Simeon picks up
[1:48:20] the child now I can depart in peace mine
[1:48:22] eyes have seen thy salvation Hallelujah
[1:48:25] and then blind Anna comes in she saw way
[1:48:27] more than those people she comes and a
[1:48:29] prophetess comes in picks up the child
[1:48:32] Hallelujah that was God's slot
[1:48:34] Hallelujah being
[1:48:38] manifested hallelujah what does God
[1:48:41] think towards you focus on
[1:48:45] that
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:48] now he was RAB her expected him wasn't
[1:48:53] to die with those people in the
[1:48:55] city her expected end is that she would
[1:48:57] become into into the lineage of Jesus
[1:49:00] Christ Hallelujah she was ordained to be
[1:49:02] part of that
[1:49:05] lineage now but she was living in a time
[1:49:08] where Israel was coming in to possess
[1:49:10] its Promised Land as it was promised to
[1:49:12] their forefathers the land was promised
[1:49:14] to Abraham but he didn't possess it he
[1:49:16] just walked upon it then it had to
[1:49:18] become 400 odd years later or however
[1:49:20] long it was and then finally fin only
[1:49:22] Israel possessed the promise and much
[1:49:25] like today you read many scriptures the
[1:49:27] Apostle Paul Peter are writing promises
[1:49:29] you know prophecies but they weren't for
[1:49:31] that day they for this day Hallelujah
[1:49:34] that you know that the forefathers
[1:49:35] didn't possess it they just walked out
[1:49:37] upon it then there comes a generation at
[1:49:39] the end that will possess the fullness
[1:49:40] of the promise Hallelujah and that is
[1:49:42] that is the people we are amen so that
[1:49:45] and then so there she so now so so just
[1:49:48] as Rahab was living there and Israel was
[1:49:51] coming in to receive its inher
[1:49:53] so we are living in a time where a bride
[1:49:55] is coming back to her Homeland her
[1:49:56] possession the word of God
[1:49:59] hallelujah amen and then now rahab's
[1:50:02] there the oncoming destruction she hears
[1:50:04] about the oncoming destruction but
[1:50:06] something in her said there must be
[1:50:08] Mercy in this destruction there was a
[1:50:11] death sentence on on Jericho but
[1:50:14] something in her said there must be
[1:50:15] Mercy For Me amen it's the same thing we
[1:50:18] see this world is falling apart we see
[1:50:20] there will be an Armageddon but there's
[1:50:22] something in heart I trust it cried out
[1:50:24] when you heard the world world is
[1:50:26] falling apart when you heard that this
[1:50:27] world is going to be destroyed something
[1:50:29] and you said there must be Mercy For Me
[1:50:31] Lord there must be a way there must be
[1:50:33] Mercy for me make a way for me Lord
[1:50:35] hallelujah and she received a token she
[1:50:38] found she found Mercy thank you Lord she
[1:50:41] applied that token God came and
[1:50:44] destroyed the place where she was locked
[1:50:46] up and she was free and it's the same
[1:50:50] thing with us God destroyed our Jericho
[1:50:54] Hallelujah you're bouncing around hey we
[1:50:56] were all oh but I did no we were all
[1:50:58] bouncing around in a little Jericho box
[1:51:00] and our our little manmade this is what
[1:51:02] we do but God didn't want us to be that
[1:51:04] way he want us to walk free am mean that
[1:51:06] we would come into our possession
[1:51:08] Hallelujah but then now so God came and
[1:51:11] destroyed the place it really got
[1:51:14] destroyed brother bam says this in
[1:51:16] Hebrews chapter 6 and I'll try and wind
[1:51:17] this up he says and how so he's speaking
[1:51:20] about the blood and how can I then as
[1:51:24] after Christ has died for me and I
[1:51:26] became his righteousness because of his
[1:51:29] grace and love to me how can I sin when
[1:51:32] there's something laying between me and
[1:51:34] God a sacrifice I can't sin I can't do
[1:51:36] it God never sees me he sees Christ he
[1:51:40] stands in my place and when I do
[1:51:42] anything wrong Christ takes my place
[1:51:45] I've made my confession I'm wrong he's
[1:51:47] right Lord you know my heart you know
[1:51:49] whether I mean it or not I'm wrong
[1:51:51] forgive me God sees it the blood of
[1:51:54] Jesus has got me covered all the time I
[1:51:57] like those words all the time I mean how
[1:51:59] can God ever see me how can sin be
[1:52:02] counted to me when he can't do it just
[1:52:05] as soon as I do it it's forgiven that's
[1:52:07] right it's like taking a little dropper
[1:52:09] like this little eye dropper full of
[1:52:11] black ink hold it over a tub of bleach
[1:52:13] and it just drops in there and then try
[1:52:16] to find it again it turns to the bleach
[1:52:18] the ink becomes bleach that's what you
[1:52:20] do what you'll confess sin
[1:52:23] if you're in Christ between you and God
[1:52:25] is a whole tub of bleach and your sins
[1:52:27] become righteous because of righteous
[1:52:29] sacrifices waiting there for you
[1:52:32] Hallelujah am amen isn't that
[1:52:36] wonderful now but the thing is now
[1:52:39] Rahab Rahab was now living in a place
[1:52:42] she's an alien she's not part of the
[1:52:44] Commonwealth of God and now she's living
[1:52:47] in a place where Israel has taken over
[1:52:50] and we know that the and so now here
[1:52:52] comes thee but God doesn't finish with
[1:52:55] her because God wants her to know that
[1:52:58] she has a right to dwell there
[1:53:01] Hallelujah friends you have a right to
[1:53:03] dwell in the word of God you have a
[1:53:05] right you have a right and but it's by
[1:53:08] Union with Christ with Jesus Christ's
[1:53:11] word you have a right for every to every
[1:53:13] Divine promise now
[1:53:16] anyone like
[1:53:17] Rahab no one has a right to object to
[1:53:21] you being United with Christ as she was
[1:53:24] with Solomon no doubt there were many
[1:53:26] women who would have been a better wife
[1:53:28] maybe amen two Salone they were Jewish
[1:53:32] woman all kinds of things you're the
[1:53:35] right kind of woman but here was a
[1:53:37] gentile who was a
[1:53:39] harlot and now salmon was looking for
[1:53:42] the right woman remember like Mar's like
[1:53:46] Hallelujah God saw something in you even
[1:53:48] when you may never have seen it God saw
[1:53:51] something in you place something in you
[1:53:52] before the foundation of the world and
[1:53:54] here comes Salomon and and and he goes
[1:53:57] to marry Rahab and maybe there was a lot
[1:53:59] of fussing going along in Israel how D
[1:54:01] this you know Rahab say that you know I
[1:54:05] can't stand I should have married
[1:54:09] him he followed me and then maybe well
[1:54:12] maybe in those days I don't know how
[1:54:14] they did it but does anyone object to
[1:54:16] this Union speak now forever hold your
[1:54:18] peace I can't I'm going to stand up so
[1:54:21] just maybe some woman stands up she was
[1:54:23] a harlot she lived this kind of life and
[1:54:26] may be listed out all her sins and
[1:54:28] salmon remember it's God's choosing
[1:54:30] man's choosing said Okay if that is the
[1:54:33] case find the ones the men that she was
[1:54:37] a harlot worth you hear a pin drop why
[1:54:41] because they're dead her past has been
[1:54:44] annihilated amen her past has been
[1:54:46] destroyed there's no living evidence
[1:54:49] it's all gone hallelujah it's all gone
[1:54:53] and that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:54:54] Christ does for us amen our past is
[1:54:57] eradicated it's not just covered over
[1:54:59] it's not just swept under a rug it's
[1:55:01] been annihilated in the blood of Jesus
[1:55:02] Christ am mean that the evidence is done
[1:55:04] away with blessed be the Lord hallelujah
[1:55:08] and then and then so well now everyone
[1:55:10] has to shut up and they have a right to
[1:55:13] get married Hallelujah and they get
[1:55:16] married and what she
[1:55:18] was just by saying I do have you said I
[1:55:21] do to Jesus

[1:55:52] bread so now her old identity by saying
[1:55:54] I do it's
[1:55:56] eradicated Hallelujah because Salon
[1:55:59] being a general took care of it took
[1:56:02] care of her past Hallelujah and then now
[1:56:05] someone comes along maybe someone's
[1:56:07] traveling because she would have looked
[1:56:08] different to everyone else in Israel I
[1:56:10] don't think she'd looked Jewish to me
[1:56:12] she wasn't she's a gentile then maybe

[1:57:56] lot you know
[1:57:59] and there's something in us what me I
[1:58:02] don't know I yeah I think I'm going to
[1:58:03] be lost for words but I trust when we
[1:58:05] see the dead in Christ arise we go to
[1:58:07] meet the Lord in the air we just say

[1:58:42] say um no I'm married to Salomon I have
[1:58:46] a right to live and Bethlehem and we
[1:58:49] have a right that's why the devil what
[1:58:51] does he attack
[1:58:52] you really a Believer you think you're
[1:58:54] one of them this is all some hashed up
[1:58:57] thing out of Kentucky or wherever just
[1:58:59] some conspiracy theory no no no no no no
[1:59:03] I didn't meet William
[1:59:05] brandham I did not meet him I met Jesus
[1:59:08] Christ this
[1:59:11] word this word stepped out of History
[1:59:15] amen he stepped out of History to me I
[1:59:18] didn't change me he changed me he
[1:59:22] transformed me even against my own self
[1:59:27] I had to come to a place where said Lord
[1:59:28] I give up amen I had no human pressure
[1:59:32] to become a Believer I had no church
[1:59:34] pressuring me I had no one saying come
[1:59:36] on just well you know come on you can do
[1:59:38] it just do no no no it was him and
[1:59:41] me amen and I know it's the same I know
[1:59:45] it's him I know it's the original Faith
[1:59:48] because it produces the word and there's
[1:59:50] a spirit in me cannot deny this word
[1:59:54] hallelujah hallelujah nothing can
[1:59:56] explain this word away amen well how do
[1:59:59] you know it's it it's the author of the
[2:00:00] book amen because the author will never
[2:00:02] deny his own work amen hallelujah will
[2:00:05] never diminish it never explain it away
[2:00:08] it always be in its full strength amenu
[2:00:11] now the reason I say this is because it
[2:00:13] says in Isaiah
[2:00:15] 54 let's just go there I'm going to read
[2:00:18] verses 16 and 17
[2:00:24] I'm sorry this is not on the not on
[2:00:27] there Isaiah 54 vers 16 and
[2:00:32] 17 I need to work out how to use the new
[2:00:44] software I'm waiting for everyone so say
[2:00:48] Amen when you are there am
[2:00:52] there we go good
[2:00:55] now
[2:00:58] behold see the reason I want to read
[2:01:01] this the reason the whole because we
[2:01:03] have to have Supreme confidence now keep
[2:01:04] turning I want everyone to be he there
[2:01:07] Isaiah
[2:01:14] 54 so so the reason I'm I'm saying these
[2:01:17] things is we have to have Supreme
[2:01:18] confidence in our Lord Jesus amen that's
[2:01:21] why I want to I want to lift them up a
[2:01:22] little bit higher I mean that you'd
[2:01:24] admire him more you'd love him more
[2:01:25] you'd appreciate him more for what he's
[2:01:27] done to you not just what he's done in
[2:01:29] history what he's done to you what he's
[2:01:31] done for you am mean that our identity
[2:01:33] is not in ourselves it's in
[2:01:35] him
[2:01:39] Hallelujah because we have to come to a
[2:01:41] place now Isaiah 54
[2:01:43] and6 and
[2:01:45] 17 because the enemy comes against us
[2:01:49] right he comes against you he tries to
[2:01:52] make he tries to dechristianize you amen
[2:01:56] many times it's him trying to get you to
[2:01:57] think you're not a Believer but then
[2:01:59] he'll anoint other people to say you're
[2:02:01] not a Christian you're not even part of
[2:02:03] the accepted School of churches well
[2:02:05] neither was the book of Acts church
[2:02:06] either that's right by the
[2:02:09] way Isaiah
[2:02:11] 54:16 behold I have created the Smith
[2:02:16] that bloweth the coals in the fire and
[2:02:18] that bringeth forth an instrument for
[2:02:20] his work and I have cre created the
[2:02:22] wasted to destroy no weapon that is
[2:02:26] formed against thee shall prosper and
[2:02:28] every tongue that shall rise up against
[2:02:31] thee in judgment shall thou condemn this
[2:02:34] is the heritage of the Servants of the
[2:02:36] Lord and their righteousness is of me
[2:02:40] sayith the Lord hallelujah so no weapon
[2:02:44] amen put this on your fridge if you you
[2:02:46] if you got room no weapon that is formed
[2:02:48] against you shall prosper this is God
[2:02:50] speaking to you no weapon weapon the
[2:02:52] devil has a lot of weapons but no weapon
[2:02:55] that is formed against the shall prosper
[2:02:57] and every tongue that shall rise against
[2:02:59] the in judgment Thou shalt condemn why
[2:03:02] could why could Rahab condemn every
[2:03:04] tongue that raised against her in
[2:03:05] judgment should say one where's my pass
[2:03:07] gone it's gone it's dead it's buried
[2:03:10] it's history Hallelujah the blood
[2:03:13] eradicates how pass I mean so nothing
[2:03:15] about pass can be held against us and
[2:03:17] then twoo when people come along and say
[2:03:19] what are you living in here Bethlehem go
[2:03:20] why are you living in bethleem Rahab you
[2:03:22] don't even belong here should say Yes I

[2:03:27] Salmon I have a god-given right to live
[2:03:29] in this place Hallelujah and that's why
[2:03:32] you've got to look when when the enemy
[2:03:34] comes against you says you're not a
[2:03:35] Believer you're not a Christian whatever
[2:03:36] whatever you say now hold on hold on I
[2:03:39] have a god-given right Amen to call
