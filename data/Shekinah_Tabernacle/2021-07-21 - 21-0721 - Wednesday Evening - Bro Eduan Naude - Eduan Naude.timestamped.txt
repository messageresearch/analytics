[3:31] praise the lord um welcome to the house
[3:33] of god this evening
[3:35] it's good to be a christian it's good to
[3:36] be here it's good to be able to worship
[3:38] the lord
[3:39] just to be saved who enjoys being saved
[3:44] there's no fun being lost i remember
[3:45] being lost when i was a little kid we
[3:47] went out in the bush
[3:49] and then it got dark and we were like in
[3:52] the country that
[3:53] it gets dark in the country because
[3:54] there's no lights around or nothing we
[3:56] were lost man
[3:58] and then we actually prayed lord help us
[4:01] get back home
[4:02] i think we took about two hours trying
[4:04] to get home in the dark and now and then
[4:05] a
[4:07] car would drive across the old country
[4:08] road somewhere in the distance you know
[4:10] so we'd see these car lights and we'll
[4:11] think oh that must be that particular
[4:12] road so we'd kind of walk up and over
[4:14] these hills
[4:16] we got back about probably 8
[4:19] 30 and maybe it must have been winter
[4:22] because it was
[4:23] been dark for a couple of hours and we
[4:25] were we thought there'd be this
[4:26] rousing welcome now parents will be so
[4:28] worried about where we were they didn't
[4:29] even know we got back

[32:00] did you call it this week did you call
[32:03] it
[32:05] i call it call it i love it eh
[32:08] exodus 32
[32:12] and the lord said unto moses i've seen
[32:14] this people and behold
[32:15] it is a stiff-necked people now
[32:18] therefore let me alone that my wrath
[32:20] may wax cold against them and that i may
[32:23] consume them
[32:25] and i will make thee a great nation what
[32:28] a promise there as well
[32:29] the lord can't yeah you'll see and moses
[32:33] besought
[32:34] the lord his god and said lord why does
[32:37] thy wrath wax co
[32:39] hot against thy people which those
[32:42] brought
[32:42] forth out of the land of egypt with
[32:44] great power
[32:45] and with a mighty hand wherefore should
[32:48] the egyptians
[32:49] speak and say for mischief did he bring
[32:52] them out
[32:53] to slay them in the mountains and to
[32:54] consume them from the face of the earth
[32:58] turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of
[33:00] this evil against thy people
[33:04] what what desperate
[33:07] desperation this prophet of god has in
[33:10] this moment
[33:12] and who's speaking there remember i
[33:15] abram isaac israel thy servants to whom
[33:19] thou swearest by then
[33:20] by thine own self that sitteth unto them
[33:24] i will multiply your seed as the stars
[33:26] of heaven and all of this land
[33:28] that i have spoken will i give unto your
[33:31] seed and they
[33:32] shall inherit it forever and the lord
[33:34] repenteth
[33:35] of the evil which he thought to do unto
[33:38] his people that's a very very powerful
[33:43] scripture there
[33:44] and then just a quick one um and this
[33:47] came
[33:48] slightly late into and this is um
[33:50] ezekiel so i can go here
[33:52] oh no sorry ezekiel
[33:56] 9 verse 4.
[34:03] very familiar scriptures
[34:07] ezekiel 9 verse 4
[34:11] and the lord said unto him go through
[34:13] the midst of the city through the midst
[34:15] of jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[34:17] forwards of the men
[34:18] that sigh and that cry of all the
[34:21] abomination that be done in the midst
[34:23] thereof
[34:24] and to the others he said in the in mine
[34:27] hearing
[34:28] go ye after them through the city and
[34:30] smite
[34:31] let not your eyes spare neither
[34:35] have ye pity may the lord bless his word
[34:39] you may have your seats
[34:43] sorry it's very powerful scriptures
[34:46] these
[34:46] um but
[34:50] hopefully this thought will will will
[34:52] drive it home will make it
[34:54] real in your life i will start my little
[34:59] thing here to try and keep my time and
[35:08] my my little thought here right at the
[35:10] top is have
[35:11] my mercy lord now i only realized that
[35:14] at the back when
[35:15] brother asked me the title is this can
[35:18] also go both ways and i think
[35:20] our last service that the title also
[35:24] um you could also it's quicker to see
[35:27] the negative connotation to this than
[35:28] the
[35:29] than the positive so i would just maybe
[35:31] explain a bit of an introduction
[35:34] um so yeah so you might sing
[35:37] think have my mercy lord so take it
[35:41] mercy is over let's leave this earth
[35:44] let's go away
[35:45] let's be under your wing no no not yet
[35:49] the little mercy that i have can you use
[35:52] it lord
[35:53] can you take this mercy and show to that
[35:56] outer world
[35:57] take me into that world let i be mercy
[36:00] for them
[36:01] can i stand in the gap so i
[36:05] we we had on sunday i was just praying
[36:07] there in the back
[36:08] and you always got this little
[36:12] you know glory when something is good or
[36:14] amen or hallelujah you know
[36:15] oh have mercy lord there's a brother
[36:18] here in my right that usually
[36:20] say that and and and for some reason i
[36:23] said
[36:23] have my mercy lord but in the moment of
[36:27] where was fervent in a moment where i
[36:30] was
[36:31] sincere and i was thinking of what is
[36:34] going on in this world what is going
[36:36] around us
[36:37] and so from that angle
[36:41] i want to take have my mercy lord and
[36:44] have my mercy
[36:46] me being in a desperate state of what's
[36:49] going on around us
[36:51] yes the victory that we have but there's
[36:53] someone out there that does not have
[36:55] victory
[36:56] we need to show them something what are
[36:58] we going to show them
[36:59] so i just highlighted the the the
[37:02] definition of desperate
[37:03] having lost hope a desperate spirit
[37:06] crying for relief
[37:09] giving no ground to hope the outlook was
[37:11] desperate moved by
[37:12] desperate despair or utter loss of hope
[37:15] victims
[37:16] made desperate by abuse involving
[37:18] employing
[37:19] extreme measures in an attempt to escape
[37:22] defeat or frustration
[37:24] made a desperate leap for the rope
[37:27] now some of you might have seen in the
[37:30] news
[37:31] south africa is in a bit of turmoil
[37:34] and there was this one picture one um
[37:37] headline and i only only read the little
[37:39] subject
[37:39] where a mother was in a standing on the
[37:42] top of a building
[37:43] that was burning and she threw her child
[37:47] to safety but to strangers there's two
[37:50] ways you can take this
[37:52] and this is now media driving um
[37:56] how could a mother throw her baby to
[37:59] strangers
[38:01] well that's a bit of a first world type
[38:04] of
[38:05] yeah i i want to say a dumb question
[38:08] but i'll i'll i'll i'll keep i'll be
[38:12] restrained um
[38:16] it's fight or flight right and that
[38:20] mother was desperate desperate to save a
[38:24] life
[38:24] desperate to have everything that she
[38:27] loves and on this earth to to
[38:30] keep safe to let live to extend life
[38:34] right and while we're on the subject of
[38:37] south africa
[38:39] and there's a lot that's happening
[38:41] around us not just south
[38:43] south africa i found this little
[38:46] video clip that someone shared with me
[38:49] and just to give a bit of context
[38:51] 200 malls in south africa were affected
[38:54] by this looting and destroying and
[38:56] terrorizing a lot were burned down shops
[39:00] and all that so if you want to put that
[39:02] in context 200 malls
[39:04] uh new zealand will never see 200 moles
[39:07] they don't even have 50. so that is
[39:12] that's 40 so in context again 45
[39:16] businesses
[39:17] in durban is out of commission that's
[39:19] one city
[39:21] in in south africa um just imagine how
[39:24] many businesses we have here
[39:26] and if you want to put that in context
[39:28] uh something that caught my eye
[39:31] 353 000 tons of
[39:33] sugar destroyed
[39:37] yes 1.5 million homes
[39:40] are without income i just i don't want
[39:44] to speak just about that
[39:46] and there's floods all around the world
[39:48] we see germany now and
[39:50] we see rumors of war china and japan
[39:53] fighting over in taiwan fires throughout
[39:57] canada and russia
[39:58] there was another fire i just heard
[40:00] another country
[40:02] i don't know china is now flooding as
[40:04] well
[40:07] people are in desperation perpetual
[40:09] desperation we've got here
[40:11] our own little floods and stuff and i
[40:13] say not a little
[40:14] to be little we are we are a small
[40:18] country
[40:19] but let our prayers go out to
[40:22] people in westport you know there might
[40:25] be one soul
[40:27] we need to get desperate for that one
[40:28] soul what are we doing for that one soul
[40:33] going slightly back i just want to
[40:35] reiterate i'm preaching to myself
[40:39] the lord's laid this on my heart and if
[40:42] it was just for me praise the lord
[40:44] because
[40:44] i need to work i've got work to do
[40:49] perpetual desperation so let's put that
[40:52] into eternal
[40:53] desperation um
[40:58] we won we won
[41:01] we're victorious we called it okay
[41:16] should we not be desperate for those
[41:19] that's
[41:19] lost that don't know their destination
[41:23] we also know their destination
[41:24] destination
[41:25] it's it's it's truth all lies it is
[41:28] black and
[41:29] white there's two paths right
[41:32] should we not be on our knees
[41:33] continuously the prayers are coming
[41:37] and what what are we doing and and
[41:41] satan has got us so bound with time and
[41:43] i'm speaking i'm speaking to myself
[41:46] so with time the allocation of time not
[41:48] getting to the things that we really
[41:50] want to uh or need to um
[41:53] and it's just keeping us busy and this
[41:56] could be work this could be
[41:57] you know you're ambitious you're working
[41:58] for a a job and you
[42:00] the sole income provider for your home
[42:02] and the law the
[42:04] satan will also keep you busy to a point
[42:06] where you go this is not balance
[42:08] we need to work on this as it was in the
[42:12] days of noah now here's my little
[42:14] thought
[42:14] um that i had way back before i had this
[42:19] have thou have my mercy lord is
[42:23] tying into this desperation
[42:27] in the days of noah people not only on
[42:30] the outside
[42:31] but on the inside of noah's ark this is
[42:35] now
[42:36] my view i would not be surprised if
[42:39] there were scratched marks on the inside
[42:42] of that door of noah's ark because when
[42:45] that flood
[42:46] started when the water rose and when the
[42:49] tire hit the road
[42:50] when the reality dawned on the people
[42:53] inside in safety that there's loved ones
[42:57] out there
[42:58] there's people screaming hollering
[43:01] bringing back coming back to my thought
[43:03] here have my mercy lord was this not
[43:05] someone inside that ark
[43:07] on their knees crying out open the door
[43:10] one last time can we not given two
[43:12] people
[43:12] three people is there not space for one
[43:15] more
[43:18] the door was shut that was the lord and
[43:21] that day that time that everything was
[43:23] gone there was
[43:26] i think there was an absolute
[43:28] desperation from inside the ark
[43:31] is seeing remember now yeah so noah was
[43:35] in this time and we've all heard the
[43:37] story where
[43:39] you are ludicrous all this water where
[43:42] will it come from you building a boat in
[43:44] the middle of nowhere
[43:45] there's just no now coming back to this
[43:48] thought
[43:48] as soon as the reality dawn
[43:52] so now water droplets are falling now
[43:54] fountains are bursting now everything
[43:57] falls into place how many times did
[43:59] brother branham talk about a
[44:01] a a a vision that he had and he started
[44:03] explaining
[44:04] and how the how the lord miraculously
[44:08] turned events and people and everything
[44:10] to align to
[44:11] that vision to that thus saith the lord
[44:15] when that happens people sit upright
[44:17] people start listening people
[44:19] in that moment you go
[44:22] that's it that's the lord speaking there
[44:29] you're going to stand guilty of adultery
[44:32] because that the love of god has
[44:34] leaked out of your heart you still go to
[44:37] church you might still dance in the
[44:38] spirit you might still speak with
[44:40] tongues
[44:41] and then things are fine but that's not
[44:43] it no sir
[44:45] so i don't know what's yep so i just
[44:48] want to quickly briefly
[44:50] leaking out versus bursting forth
[44:54] leaking out leaking out as subtle
[44:56] leaking out as
[44:57] you is unnoticeable sometimes and that's
[45:00] a waste
[45:01] you know let's let's take i always take
[45:04] a
[45:04] analogy with a car for example um
[45:08] oil leaking out of a car no good
[45:11] don't buy that car fix that car you know
[45:15] that is not good what is worse obviously
[45:19] is the engine blows up so there's a
[45:22] bursting
[45:23] right there's oil all over the
[45:25] windscreen there's
[45:26] you know the car is not moving it is
[45:29] it's done
[45:30] right tying that to
[45:34] should we not we should not leak here on
[45:36] the on the on the inside
[45:38] we come to church we we we are a
[45:42] a people of gospel for the the message
[45:45] of this hour
[45:46] we are but we we're going through the
[45:49] motions and we come here
[45:50] and we sing and we dance and we and we
[45:52] go home
[45:53] and just this love is just leaking it's
[45:55] just leaking
[45:56] we come here for a refilling sometimes
[45:58] we top up that oil
[46:00] the love is still leaking love is the
[46:02] leaking that love for that guy out there
[46:04] not here love is still leaking we re
[46:07] fill up love is still leaking
[46:10] you don't notice what's happening there
[46:13] maybe
[46:14] but now down the line in the middle of
[46:17] nowhere
[46:18] the car stops and it's had its time
[46:22] engine doesn't turn the car explodes my
[46:24] dad my dad had a little car
[46:26] uh i shouldn't say this brother romantic
[46:28] folks volcan sorry man
[46:29] but it blow i blew up it blew up it was
[46:32] a little diesel
[46:33] and it had a small little turbo and all
[46:35] of a sudden him and mama's driving and
[46:38] there's just oil on the windscreen and
[46:40] everything just you know
[46:42] and and that that was it now you know
[46:45] there's something wrong
[46:46] okay so rather burst in you know
[46:49] burst with laughter burst with joy burst
[46:52] with this gospel that's given to you
[46:54] but keep that leak that leak that that
[46:56] nut at the bottom needs to be tight
[46:58] nothing needs to be leaking out let it
[47:00] come forth let it burst forth
[47:02] show that love and on that
[47:07] you are not comfortable when you are
[47:10] desperate
[47:13] if you're comfortable step up
[47:17] walk more walk further testify
[47:20] his goodness sing of his glory with our
[47:23] testimonies now in our church and that
[47:25] will this will come
[47:26] and you will hear of it of god god
[47:29] moving
[47:30] god speaking truth god take control
[47:34] and and and god coming on the scene in
[47:37] in moments in in families lives of
[47:40] desperation
[47:41] saying lord this is impossible i don't
[47:44] see a way out
[47:46] but then lord rich in mercy
[47:49] you come on the scene so don't get
[47:53] comfortable

[48:01] on the street
[48:02] fishermen taxman

[48:08] desperate to catch his revelation the
[48:11] revelation of what he
[48:12] is and he was
[48:15] and he is to come so
[48:19] why should you why should you get
[48:21] desperate

[49:12] thousands and ten thousands like the
[49:14] prophet seen when he went over the
[49:15] curtain of time
[49:17] when he saw all those coming towards
[49:19] himself brother
[49:20] may that be a desperation on this side
[49:23] of the jordan

[49:49] listen um
[49:51] i just want to bless brother ben for his
[49:54] obedience in that and sending us that
[49:56] i don't care whether they match now
[49:57] we're talking about his nice little coat
[49:59] oh let's read there because i think it's
[50:01] a bit more yeah i don't care whether my
[50:03] coat matches my trousers
[50:04] and i have a hard time my wife my
[50:07] daughter-in-law someone have to tell me
[50:09] what kind of tie i have to wear i don't
[50:11] care whether they match
[50:12] if brother ki ben was here he would say
[50:14] i'm matching too much i've just got blue
[50:16] on blue and blue and blue
[50:18] i want my experience to match god's word
[50:22] that's the thing
[50:22] because that's where i aim to live not
[50:25] down in the corner yonder with the
[50:26] joneses
[50:28] but yonder in glory where jesus has gone
[50:30] to prepare us a place yes
[50:32] i want that yes sir keep me from all
[50:36] this
[50:36] this old tabernacle here you know what
[50:38] it is the body is an
[50:40] old coach that you wear a coat that you

[50:52] you've got a better coat
[50:53] it's more up to date you're on the
[50:56] inside that garment only done what it
[50:58] bore your image

[51:01] hung it up it's a rag
[51:03] that's the way this old body is you you
[51:05] just
[51:06] it's bore the image of the heavenly yet
[51:08] it's not you
[51:10] now to tie back into you are the jesus
[51:13] you are on the inside of that body you
[51:16] the spirit of god is on the inside of
[51:19] this body
[51:21] that's what makes the outcome or the
[51:23] outside come into subjection
[51:25] because the inside is pulling it see
[51:28] bringing it in line with the word of god
[51:29] you're inside
