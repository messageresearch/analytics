[40:46] foolishness of preaching

[41:33] god bless you and thank you for
[41:37] playing the music for us thank you while
[41:40] we're standing we're going to
[41:42] to read the bible because that's that's
[41:44] the only book
[41:46] we've got no law but the bible amen amen
[41:49] we've got no other tradition
[41:53] but the scripture amen we want to speak
[41:55] about the first born the tithing of the
[41:57] lord amen
[41:59] and while we're standing let's read one
[42:00] scripture and then
[42:03] hebrews chapter 12.
[42:06] let's read hebrews chapter 12
[42:10] i believe that is a verse
[42:24] sorry
[42:29] right hebrews 12 23 amen
[42:33] he prospered 23 sorry i'm already
[42:37] very nervous and i'm reading hebrews 11
[42:41] instead of
[42:42] hebrews 12 amen and i'm surprised why
[42:44] the scripture has given me something
[42:46] else
[42:47] amen let's read the hebrews i'm trying
[42:50] to go back with this thing
[42:55] that's right sorry right
[42:58] hebrews chapter 12 are we there
[43:03] the bible says in hebrews chapter 12
[43:06] to the general assembly and the church
[43:08] of the first born
[43:10] which are written in heaven and to god
[43:12] the judge of all
[43:14] and to the spirits of just men
[43:17] made perfect hallelujah that is our
[43:20] scripture tonight i believe
[43:22] we can enjoy our sins i just wanna i
[43:24] just want to
[43:26] to get relaxed and settled are you are
[43:29] you fine this evening
[43:31] i like how brother isaac likes to greet
[43:32] didn't he just make everyone relax he
[43:34] said hello
[43:34] is everyone okay so i'd like to copy him
[43:37] tonight is everyone all right everybody
[43:40] had a wonderful day just relax amen
[43:42] and then let's be in the presence of god
[43:44] amen but let's be cautious
[43:46] that in as much as we can be relaxed in
[43:48] as much as we can be comfortable
[43:50] but we are in the presence of the most
[43:52] high god all of you are welcome in the
[43:54] service of the lord
[43:55] but let us pay attention to what the
[43:57] lord might have
[43:59] for us this evening it may not be so
[44:01] much from me
[44:03] because i'm not i'm not a a preacher as
[44:05] you may you may catagorize the preachers
[44:08] i'm just your brother who just come and
[44:09] talk to you
[44:11] but based on what the lord has laid in
[44:12] my heart and i don't even ask to preach
[44:14] he's the pastor
[44:16] who asks me so i find it very difficult
[44:19] for saying no because previously i bent
[44:22] my fingers in so many ways
[44:23] by refusing to do what god wants me to
[44:25] do and that is the only reason why
[44:28] i agree otherwise i was going to say
[44:30] brother there's so many
[44:31] many men in the church who are capable
[44:34] better preachers than me but because the
[44:37] lord puts things in our hearts and the
[44:38] lord wants us we don't want to be
[44:40] like the prophet jonah in the bible and
[44:43] be forced to do the will of god
[44:45] we want to be available and willing
[44:48] to work amen so we have read the
[44:51] scripture
[44:52] and then the lord has laid a thought in
[44:55] my heart for some time now
[44:57] and i've i struggled to to to put it the
[45:00] way that
[45:02] it comes in my heart and i believe today
[45:04] the little bit that i have
[45:06] we can be able to share and and and and
[45:09] enjoy just to encourage you to motivate
[45:11] you
[45:11] to show you exactly who you are because
[45:15] it is only when you understand who you
[45:17] are
[45:18] that you can be able to navigate through
[45:20] the storms of life
[45:21] because if you don't understand and
[45:23] don't know who exactly you are
[45:25] it becomes very difficult it becomes
[45:28] almost
[45:28] impossible because you don't understand
[45:31] who you are
[45:32] you are you are confusing your identity
[45:34] so if you understand and
[45:36] you know who you are in the body of the
[45:39] living god
[45:40] then it's easy to tell the devil to
[45:42] separate between
[45:43] the thoughts of god and the thoughts of
[45:45] the devil because they are all coming
[45:47] fighting in this common battleground as
[45:49] we previously spoke which is the human
[45:51] mind
[45:52] but it can become difficult if you don't
[45:54] know
[45:55] who you are if you don't understand who
[45:58] you
[45:58] are if you can't identify yourself
[46:02] in your name amen so that is the first
[46:05] one and this
[46:06] this church of the firstborn that i'm
[46:07] talking about in
[46:09] all simple times it is you you are going
[46:12] to see how are you
[46:13] you going to are you a firstborn of the
[46:16] living god you
[46:17] of all the people on earth you are going
[46:20] to understand why
[46:21] why would god make you the firstborn
[46:25] why why would god choose you of all the
[46:28] people what did you do
[46:29] nothing what did i do
[46:32] zero i did absolutely minus zero
[46:37] i did minus zero i actually did even
[46:40] worse
[46:42] he still decided to take me off all the
[46:45] good people
[46:46] of all the capable people of all the
[46:49] the willing people willing people yeah
[46:53] he did not bring them in but he decided
[46:56] to
[46:56] bring you in this is a very challenging
[46:59] question brother and sister
[47:00] it is a challenging question because it
[47:03] it it requires me and you to pause
[47:06] it requires me and you to stop and think
[47:10] about why did god choose me
[47:14] for what reason why did god save me
[47:17] why would god out of his powerful mighty
[47:21] eternal elective love sorry
[47:23] choose me why did god do that
[47:26] but that's not our discussion tonight
[47:28] our discussion is to show you that
[47:30] even though you might not get the answer
[47:32] of that question
[47:33] he has chosen you you are his chosen
[47:36] one you me and you and tonight i'm not
[47:40] going to
[47:41] bless you or bang you or
[47:45] be hard on you i'm just going to try my
[47:47] best to show you
[47:48] that you are the firstborn of the living
[47:50] god am i are we together
[47:52] so let's move on and see we've i'm going
[47:55] to
[47:55] if you will tolerate me and allow me i'm
[47:58] going to
[47:59] read those scriptures it's long
[48:02] but that's what our message is about
[48:04] this evening hey this is the anna
[48:06] that's what it is tonight and i would
[48:08] like you the young ones and the older
[48:10] ones
[48:10] please just pay attention as we go
[48:12] deeper try to
[48:14] just put yourself in what is being
[48:16] spoken if you put yourself in what is
[48:18] being spoken if you listen
[48:21] and go with that what is being spoken
[48:23] then you do not lose track of what
[48:25] is coming from the front you do not you
[48:27] cannot find yourself your mind floating
[48:29] elsewhere
[48:30] when you are here physically are we
[48:32] together your body your spirit
[48:34] your soul will be here you will actually
[48:36] be seeing the lord jesus if we say
[48:38] the lord jesus talks to the woman you'll
[48:40] actually be
[48:41] imagining and seeing her him talking to
[48:44] her
[48:45] ah so you won't be hearing the lord
[48:48] jesus
[48:48] but you are saying hey that food
[48:52] whatever can come to your mind so you
[48:53] want you won't float around because
[48:55] that's the job of the devil you the
[48:57] devil will be able to be outside of your
[49:00] thoughts
[49:01] if you just focus on what the lord wants
[49:03] to speak to us tonight amen
[49:05] we have read let me just read that for
[49:06] you quickly that is just a quote
[49:09] not necessarily relevant right now but
[49:11] every word of god is relevant
[49:12] but i just thought of reading it for you
[49:14] before we start that this
[49:16] this is brother branham in god hiding
[49:18] himself in simplicity
[49:20] he says this will just not only be a
[49:22] beautiful building
[49:23] that will come to but may
[49:27] everyone who comes in see the beautiful
[49:30] characteristic of jesus christ in every
[49:32] person that comes
[49:34] amen that's powerful that is so big
[49:38] when every believer comes through the
[49:40] door
[49:42] i must be able to see jesus christ
[49:44] characteristic
[49:46] do you know what is a characteristic a
[49:48] characteristic is something that
[49:49] explains someone
[49:51] it forms part of your personality part
[49:54] of your makeup
[49:56] part of your makeup so
[49:59] every person who comes there i must see
[50:02] the makeup of jesus christ
[50:04] amen in that person who comes there this
[50:06] is an
[50:07] instruction the word of god is an
[50:09] instruction
[50:11] it's not ah you may do it you may not do
[50:14] it no no you must be born again simple
[50:16] so that is the scripture that is the
[50:19] spoken word brother branham says
[50:20] everyone who comes every person who
[50:23] comes in that's how i should perceive
[50:24] that person
[50:26] right let's move on and a concentrated
[50:30] people for no matter how beautiful
[50:33] the structure is this is what this build
[50:37] the building
[50:37] that we have or the church or even the
[50:40] structure of a person
[50:41] huh the body is a structure right even
[50:44] the structure of a person
[50:45] no matter how the structure is that we
[50:48] certainly do appreciate
[50:51] the beauty of the church is the
[50:53] character
[50:54] of the people i trust this always
[50:57] be a house of god of beauty
[51:00] because if we cannot be that character
[51:03] if we can't have that characteristic
[51:05] if we cannot see a characteristic of
[51:07] jesus christ
[51:08] in my sister in my brother what are we
[51:11] actually saying
[51:13] to the devil what are we saying to the
[51:15] world why
[51:16] why why why are we here then see it
[51:19] brings so many questions
[51:20] why did i leave everything
[51:24] and come here who forced me to come here
[51:28] if i come and i don't see a character of
[51:30] jesus christ in my brother
[51:32] if i i allow the attitudes that are no
[51:35] that's not that's not my
[51:36] message i didn't plan for this but the
[51:38] point i'm trying to say is
[51:40] if i come here and i do not
[51:43] see you from the bottom of my heart not
[51:46] from at the bottom of my tongue
[51:48] from the bottom of my heart if i cannot
[51:51] see you as
[51:52] a character of jesus christ and take you
[51:55] like that
[51:58] as part of jesus christ why did i come
[52:01] here
[52:01] why do i come here every sunday and
[52:04] every wednesday
[52:05] what am i trying to achieve that is the
[52:07] question that i don't want an answer
[52:08] from you
[52:09] i just want to leave it with you in your
[52:11] hearts to say
[52:13] it does not matter what i see it doesn't
[52:16] jesus christ
[52:16] is promised to be here and he is in his
[52:19] people
[52:20] and that's what i must see yes and
[52:22] operate
[52:23] alone i must operate on that basis and
[52:26] that basis
[52:26] alone i just thought i should just throw
[52:29] that in
[52:30] that we have read and let's read the
[52:34] next one
[52:35] genesis 27 i'll read for you if he's
[52:38] okay
[52:39] so that we can we can hurry up tonight i
[52:41] don't want i don't want to finish late
[52:44] tonight i just want to make sure that um
[52:47] you you said the word of god even if we
[52:49] we one wait
[52:51] is enough from the lord amen so i'll
[52:54] make sure
[52:55] that the time is is said hallelujah
[52:59] i forgot stop watch
[53:03] amen gave up
[53:06] in the book of genesis 27 and jacob said
[53:10] unto
[53:11] his father am
[53:17] i have done according as thy bed as me
[53:20] arrives i pray thee sit and eat
[53:24] of my venison that that thy soul
[53:28] may bless me the key way that i would
[53:31] like you to focus
[53:32] is the statement that says i am iso thy
[53:35] first born
[53:36] it is jacob talking he says i am israel
[53:40] first born and he is not eso
[53:44] but why why
[53:47] is jacob lying to his father
[53:50] that he is the firstborn when he is not
[53:53] what is he why can't he just say
[53:55] i am jacob that second born here's the
[53:58] venison
[53:59] yes you send iso but here is my piece i
[54:02] want you to blame
[54:03] why why does he has to use first born
[54:08] pin code if you can call it why does he
[54:11] want to use that access code of the
[54:12] first born
[54:13] why what what is it in the first ball
[54:16] that that jacob saw that his mother
[54:19] advised him to what is it in there
[54:21] right hold day we'll go to the next
[54:24] scripture
[54:26] and exodus chapter 4 23 20 22-23
[54:30] and now shall say unto pharaoh that said
[54:33] the lord
[54:34] israel is is my son even mine
[54:38] even my first book and i say unto thee
[54:42] let my son go that he may save me
[54:45] if the if thou refuse to let him go
[54:48] behold i will slay thy son even die
[54:53] but what is it about this first pawn
[54:56] that's the question i'm asking what is
[54:58] it about this first born why
[55:00] israel is my first born and god is
[55:02] addressing israel
[55:03] as his firstborn he's not addressing the
[55:05] imagination in that veil he said he's my
[55:07] firstborn even my son
[55:10] huh and if you don't want to allow my
[55:13] first one to come
[55:14] out were you pharaoh i'm coming for you
[55:17] yeah why doesn't god say i'll come for
[55:19] your last vote
[55:21] i asked myself this question brother
[55:23] phil why doesn't he say
[55:24] okay if you can't allow i'll come for
[55:27] your first daughter
[55:29] if the daughter is not the first one
[55:31] i'll come for your third bone
[55:34] why doesn't god say that and this is
[55:36] this is the thought that i would like us
[55:38] to take along
[55:39] this thought of the first born the first
[55:42] the importance of the first born
[55:44] the significance of the first ball and
[55:46] this first one
[55:47] i would like to explain to announce to
[55:49] you brothers and sisters
[55:50] that you are that first born but i would
[55:52] like to share with you
[55:54] how important is it why is it so
[55:57] important for god
[55:58] right genesis sorry i've got so many
[56:02] scriptures
[56:03] genesis 48 let's read verse 14 and
[56:06] israel
[56:07] stretched out his hand his right hand
[56:11] his right hand we know the lord is
[56:14] sitting on the right hand of the lord
[56:15] right of god
[56:16] his right hand that's another
[56:18] significance we're not talking about
[56:20] about the right hand tonight but israel
[56:23] which is jacob
[56:24] raises his right hand and then
[56:28] laid it upon ephraim's head ibrahim was
[56:31] the second born of
[56:33] joseph we all know that right
[56:36] who was the younger and and his left
[56:38] hand upon
[56:39] manas head guiding his
[56:43] hands wittingly waiting for manasseh was
[56:46] the firstborn manas was the firstborn
[56:48] right
[56:49] and when joseph saw that his father laid
[56:52] his right hand upon the head of ephraim
[56:54] it displeased him and he laid up and
[56:58] he held up his father's hand to remove
[57:00] it
[57:01] from ephraim's head and to manaza's head
[57:03] and joseph said unto his father
[57:05] not so my father for this is the first
[57:07] ball who
[57:09] manasseh are we together put thy right
[57:12] hand
[57:13] upon his head because he's there
[57:16] are we together brothers and sisters we
[57:18] are together
[57:19] and his father refused
[57:22] and said i know it myself i know that
[57:25] he's the firstborn listen to this my son
[57:29] i know it he also shall become a people
[57:32] and he also shall be a great but truly
[57:35] his younger brother
[57:36] shall be greater than he and his head
[57:39] his seed
[57:40] shall become a multitude of nations
[57:43] this last verse i would like you to hold
[57:45] it on the side don't throw it away
[57:47] hold it on the side because this is what
[57:49] is going to this is why i'm going to
[57:50] show you
[57:51] how you come in how me and you come in
[57:54] right because batman
[57:58] ephraim is not the first boy physically
[58:01] speaking
[58:03] but jacob is making him a first born
[58:08] okay let's read romans 8 verse 29
[58:12] the bible says i've made that one
[58:14] slightly bigger so i can see it
[58:15] for whom he did for no he also did
[58:19] predestinate
[58:20] to to be conformed to the image of his
[58:23] son
[58:25] i was listening to the spoken word the
[58:27] images of christ
[58:29] man go and listen to that to the spoken
[58:31] word you know it's
[58:33] i can't talk about it now but that is
[58:36] powerful
[58:37] but he might be the first born among
[58:39] many
[58:40] brethren my own whom he did
[58:43] procrastinate
[58:44] them he also called and whom he called
[58:47] them he also justified and whom he
[58:49] justified them he also
[58:51] glorified there is an image of jesus
[58:54] christ that we
[58:55] me and you need to be conformed to
[58:57] because he is the first born
[59:00] our lord jesus are we together he's the
[59:02] first born you will see
[59:03] in the next uh scripture that will read
[59:06] that he is actually the first born of
[59:08] everything that ever existed the lord
[59:11] jesus
[59:11] he's the firstborn of everything and we
[59:14] will hear later
[59:15] that if the lord jesus is the firstborn
[59:19] and you are part of the lord jesus who
[59:21] are you
[59:23] are we together are we together we are
[59:26] the firstborn
[59:27] by virtue of us being part of jesus
[59:29] christ by virtue of
[59:31] us being predestinated if he is the head
[59:34] i am the head in my house my wife is the
[59:37] body
[59:38] we are one so she's part of me
[59:42] if i'm the first born even if she's the
[59:44] last one she's the firstborn
[59:48] you're not getting me but i'm trying to
[59:50] say
[59:51] that sister pal is the firstborn

[1:01:00] this
[1:01:00] we were now forced to sing happy
[1:01:02] birthday every year
[1:01:07] it's not a problem i'm just saying
[1:01:10] we were brought in this situation
[1:01:12] because of what happened we were not
[1:01:14] supposed to come
[1:01:15] this way we were supposed to come like
[1:01:18] the real
[1:01:18] despond i never forget that someone that
[1:01:21] brother i said preach during zoom
[1:01:24] you didn't lock down through zoom if i'm
[1:01:27] not mistaken or it was here change
[1:01:29] but and brother james also preached a
[1:01:32] similar someone
[1:01:33] that talks about amnesia who remembers
[1:01:35] them
[1:01:36] if you remember if you can just if now
[1:01:39] can god can just
[1:01:41] take this physical mind and and unblock
[1:01:44] it and you remember exactly what
[1:01:45] happened
[1:01:47] i'm telling you brother and sister
[1:01:50] nothing is going to be
[1:01:52] nothing is going to be to mean anything
[1:01:54] for you
[1:01:55] except that everything is going to come
[1:01:58] last and what god has done and revealed
[1:02:02] for you
[1:02:02] is going to be number one the scripture
[1:02:05] of
[1:02:05] matthew or john 24 will be revealed we
[1:02:08] will
[1:02:08] every second take love the lord god our
[1:02:11] god
[1:02:12] with our soul with our mind with our
[1:02:14] body with everything amen
[1:02:15] every second thought will be about him
[1:02:18] amen and us
[1:02:19] yes that's right that is what will
[1:02:21] happen but because this that this that
[1:02:23] body this this body that paul calls
[1:02:28] that what does he call it and in
[1:02:31] thessalonians
[1:02:32] who are my bible reader sorry this body
[1:02:35] this dark book this body and
[1:02:38] he talks about it a.m at last darkly
[1:02:42] thank you that's the highlight
[1:02:43] it loves ugly so your bible readers but
[1:02:46] you didn't know what i'm trying to say i
[1:02:47] don't mean you're not bible religious
[1:02:48] you are that last ugly this classically
[1:02:52] is blocking us from actually seeing what
[1:02:55] god
[1:02:56] had us before the foundation of the
[1:02:58] world so
[1:03:00] the first one for whom he did for noah
[1:03:02] he also procrastinated to conform to the
[1:03:05] image of
[1:03:05] of his son to conform to the image of
[1:03:08] his son
[1:03:09] that he might be that he might be the
[1:03:12] firstborn among many brethren
[1:03:14] because jesus christ was the first even
[1:03:16] physical
[1:03:17] he was the firstborn of mary
[1:03:20] imagine jesus christ was the third bone
[1:03:24] it wasn't going to be it wasn't going to
[1:03:26] fit because
[1:03:27] firstly apart from apart from the vision
[1:03:30] issue that she was supposed to be born
[1:03:31] by a vision
[1:03:32] apart from that he was supposed to be
[1:03:34] the one
[1:03:35] because the first one meaning is quite a
[1:03:38] specific
[1:03:38] significant meaning a first born it does
[1:03:42] not mean that the second one is not
[1:03:43] important
[1:03:44] it does not mean that that the state
[1:03:45] born or the last born
[1:03:47] my gabi does not mean they are not
[1:03:49] important they are important
[1:03:51] but there is a there is a powerful
[1:03:53] testimony there is a powerful ministry
[1:03:56] and a mystery on the first born there is
[1:03:59] a task
[1:04:00] there is there is there is a benefit a
[1:04:02] blessing on the first born
[1:04:04] who you are tonight how many are happy
[1:04:07] to be their first boss
[1:04:08] i'm so happy because i didn't qualify
[1:04:11] i'm so delighted because i did not
[1:04:14] i did not even wait it
[1:04:17] to be a first ball amen let's move on
[1:04:21] well this is i think this is our last
[1:04:22] scripture colossians chapter
[1:04:25] chapter 1 verse 15 who is the image
[1:04:28] who jesus christ who is the image of the
[1:04:31] invisible god
[1:04:33] the firstborn of every brothers and
[1:04:36] sisters are we together
[1:04:38] no sorry i i like to talk like i mean
[1:04:40] class
[1:04:41] to to to talk to you so that i can see
[1:04:45] that we are you are following me
[1:04:48] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:04:50] the firstborn of every creature
[1:04:52] for by him were all things
[1:04:55] all things created that are in heaven
[1:04:59] and that are in earth visible and
[1:05:02] invisible
[1:05:05] do you listen to that whether they are
[1:05:07] they be thrones or dominions or
[1:05:10] principalities or powers
[1:05:12] all things were created by him and for
[1:05:14] him
[1:05:15] man i'm so happy if everything was
[1:05:17] created for me remember when i when we
[1:05:19] talk about jesus christ i talk about you
[1:05:22] who believes that you are part of jesus
[1:05:24] christ let me tell you i'm trying to
[1:05:26] show you
[1:05:27] that you are god
[1:05:32] but what is it that is a statement that
[1:05:35] you know unless you don't understand
[1:05:38] what god means
[1:05:40] to be god because that thing says
[1:05:43] everything visible
[1:05:44] and invisible dominions everything
[1:05:48] was created by you
[1:05:52] because you are in the mind of god you
[1:05:53] were you were part of that logos
[1:05:58] you are part of the logos jesus christ
[1:06:01] and you i cannot be separated
[1:06:03] how can i separate christ and his head
[1:06:05] then he won't leave
[1:06:07] because it will be a heartless body yeah
[1:06:09] i mean it will it will be a bodyless
[1:06:11] head
[1:06:12] and you will be a headless body so i
[1:06:15] cannot there's no way jesus christ and
[1:06:17] you you were there at the beginning
[1:06:19] because before the foundation of the
[1:06:20] world before creation
[1:06:22] god you had you in his mind
[1:06:26] and as we spoke previously god's
[1:06:28] thoughts are eternal
[1:06:30] god's thoughts are not like this box or
[1:06:32] this cell phone no no this is zero
[1:06:34] this is this can be alienated is that
[1:06:36] the right word
[1:06:37] this can be demystified but the thought
[1:06:40] of god as the thought of god are so real
[1:06:42] they're so genuine that to think about
[1:06:45] you just for him to think the trouble
[1:06:48] that makes you real that makes eternal
[1:06:50] because god's thoughts are
[1:06:51] eternal so we are part of him
[1:06:55] let's listen to that verse what he says
[1:06:57] our principalities or powers
[1:06:59] all things were created by him and for
[1:07:02] him and he
[1:07:03] is before all things he is before
[1:07:05] meaning he was first
[1:07:08] and by him all things consist
[1:07:11] and he is the head of the body remember
[1:07:14] we said this
[1:07:15] in the church who is the beginning the
[1:07:18] firstborn of the dead
[1:07:21] that in all things he might have
[1:07:23] preeminence
[1:07:24] meaning that the first born from the red
[1:07:27] meaning that we are not
[1:07:28] afraid even to die because we can
[1:07:29] resurrect we can raise and resurrect
[1:07:32] that is why we are not afraid when the
[1:07:34] devil challenges us
[1:07:36] or challenges one of us and take him and
[1:07:39] they find themselves in the wilderness
[1:07:40] dying
[1:07:41] because we believe in resurrection we
[1:07:43] know that they will come and resurrect
[1:07:46] that is why we are not supposed to be
[1:07:48] prisoners to fear
[1:07:49] it doesn't matter what the devil brings
[1:07:53] the moment we think about our father the
[1:07:55] moment we think about who he is what he
[1:07:57] does the moment we understand who we are
[1:08:00] everything must be history every
[1:08:03] challenge they will come
[1:08:04] it's not one mean challenges are not
[1:08:06] going to come they will come because
[1:08:08] we in that focus memorial
[1:08:11] huh it says everything should mean zero
[1:08:17] test comes to try us to show and to
[1:08:20] bring out
[1:08:21] who we are into reality that's what the
[1:08:24] tests are for
[1:08:25] so we need to be able to get to a point
[1:08:27] where we understand
[1:08:28] our first born sheep if there's such a
[1:08:31] way that
[1:08:32] our firstborn would i don't know which
[1:08:34] one is the right one
[1:08:35] but now i want to talk about uh
[1:08:42] right let's start with that the
[1:08:43] importance of the firstborn i i've went
[1:08:45] and researched for a long time about
[1:08:47] what what what what is the significance
[1:08:50] of a firstborn in greek
[1:08:53] sisters in greek in greek greek
[1:08:58] david in greek
[1:09:01] the word firstborn came from
[1:09:05] the word called prototypos that
[1:09:08] protocols
[1:09:09] in greek they say it means the first
[1:09:11] born
[1:09:12] doesn't always mean the first one in
[1:09:14] terms of the number
[1:09:16] or the one who was born first wow
[1:09:20] are we together it does not always mean
[1:09:23] that
[1:09:23] because uh brother jeremy sorry he's not
[1:09:26] here so i can
[1:09:27] i can talk about it it has not been
[1:09:30] because
[1:09:30] he was the first born and then
[1:09:34] uh he he would become the firstborn
[1:09:36] obviously all the time
[1:09:38] no no otherwise me and you were not
[1:09:40] going to have a chance
[1:09:42] because we are not the first one israel
[1:09:43] was his firstborn
[1:09:45] israel god chose it and he said he is my
[1:09:47] first born
[1:09:49] otherwise me and you we're not going to
[1:09:51] have a chance if ever
[1:09:54] it will always come according to our
[1:09:56] natural
[1:09:57] number there are people that are first
[1:10:00] born by a national number and they
[1:10:01] become
[1:10:02] first borns in their spiritual meaning
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:05] but there are people who are first borns
[1:10:07] but they do not become firstborns
[1:10:09] in the spiritual realm according to how
[1:10:12] god wants it
[1:10:13] you will see what i'm talking about that
[1:10:15] was by the way prototypos
[1:10:17] meant in the ancient greek as they
[1:10:19] explained the one who was supposed to
[1:10:21] the one who inherits
[1:10:23] the one who's chosen to inherit the one
[1:10:25] who is chosen
[1:10:26] to take the leadership of the kingdom
[1:10:29] the one who isn't
[1:10:30] who is found to be worthy to be
[1:10:33] qualifying to become the firstborn that
[1:10:36] is why jacob
[1:10:37] could stop the heads i mean the hands
[1:10:40] all right that is why
[1:10:41] that is why joseph would become a leader
[1:10:46] but yet he was not jacob's facebook who
[1:10:48] then was the firstborn
[1:10:49] physically speaking and he he i'm sure
[1:10:52] reuben used to tell his father no no
[1:10:54] papa
[1:10:54] you are making a mistake i am the
[1:10:55] firstborn and this boy
[1:10:57] then jacob told him that no no no and
[1:11:01] jacob did it later on with joseph's sons
[1:11:04] by that time joseph should have
[1:11:06] understood that me
[1:11:08] i'm even the leader now i'm the ruler
[1:11:11] right but my
[1:11:12] uh i'm not the first boy so i shouldn't
[1:11:15] be arguing with my father when he
[1:11:16] crosses the hands because he knows what
[1:11:18] this is how i came at that time joseph
[1:11:21] yourself
[1:11:21] joseph joseph was more taking it on the
[1:11:23] emotional side because physically those
[1:11:25] were his children
[1:11:26] manager was supposed to be to take the
[1:11:28] inheritance and the leadership but no
[1:11:30] jacob the prophet crossed the hands
[1:11:33] okay so who is chosen or acknowledged to
[1:11:37] be the leader that is what the word
[1:11:39] was mean so it's not does not mean that
[1:11:41] because
[1:11:42] i am the firstborn automatically in
[1:11:46] god's books then i'm the facebook but
[1:11:48] you'll see as we go along
[1:11:50] that the physical times there spiritual
[1:11:53] there are shadows right
[1:11:56] internationally as we when we grew up
[1:12:00] in many cultures the firstborn is the
[1:12:03] inheritor is the one who becomes the
[1:12:04] king
[1:12:05] the firstborn is the one who's listened
[1:12:07] to the most
[1:12:08] the first one it does not mean that the
[1:12:11] other children don't get listened
[1:12:12] it doesn't mean that the first one has
[1:12:14] quite a certain position
[1:12:16] in this kingdom the first born that is
[1:12:19] how
[1:12:19] things were done but it may be that the
[1:12:23] father will see that this other child
[1:12:24] has got wisdom
[1:12:25] this other child has got a sentence
[1:12:27] called responsibility this
[1:12:29] and the father without mentioning that
[1:12:31] you are demoting you as the facebook
[1:12:33] he things will just happen and he'll
[1:12:35] just take a leadership
[1:12:37] the other child because the national
[1:12:40] fact he
[1:12:40] is the first boy you know i've heard
[1:12:43] some time ago
[1:12:44] that just to try to emphasize on this
[1:12:47] point
[1:12:48] that certain things what they mean is
[1:12:49] not what they mean
[1:12:51] they they right now each one of us have
[1:12:53] got ages we we
[1:12:55] got a certain age number maybe maybe i'm
[1:12:58] i'm i'm 23 or i'm 25.
[1:13:01] and then my friend here penny maybe he's
[1:13:04] 16.
[1:13:06] but if at least give him a realistic
[1:13:08] maybe he's eight
[1:13:09] right but you may find that
[1:13:12] the way he conduct himself he's
[1:13:15] conducting himself like a
[1:13:17] 12 year old boy the way he's matured
[1:13:20] he's conducting himself like a 16 year
[1:13:23] old boy
[1:13:24] his maturity level right
[1:13:27] again they also say in biology
[1:13:30] you know there's our physical years and
[1:13:32] there's our biology years
[1:13:35] some of us are maybe 40 or 44 now
[1:13:39] but you find that hey i'm so gray man
[1:13:41] i'm actually looking like i'm 50.
[1:13:44] you know it's possible and if they check
[1:13:47] my health
[1:13:48] how it is deteriorated they can say hey
[1:13:51] yeah actually
[1:13:52] you're biologically here you're 50 years
[1:13:54] old is that
[1:13:56] why why are the scientists is it there
[1:13:58] in biology
[1:13:59] is that but you can be so fit and so
[1:14:03] good mentally in
[1:14:04] everything but you found that even if
[1:14:06] you are 16 but in actual effect
[1:14:08] you are 43 biological
[1:14:13] so certain things what they mean they
[1:14:16] don't necessarily mean what we see
[1:14:18] because the five sense realm always
[1:14:19] deceives has always have
[1:14:21] certain limitations there was a lady in
[1:14:24] the u.s
[1:14:24] who started to be on this thing what are
[1:14:28] the sisters call it
[1:14:29] this thing that is very popular with the
[1:14:31] with the sisters believers or
[1:14:33] unbelievers is very important
[1:14:36] diet diet yes died
[1:14:40] you still called died that lady she went
[1:14:42] into a diet from the baby
[1:14:44] she went into a diet healthy eating
[1:14:48] she started to eat raw vegetables
[1:14:52] raw vegetables for a very long time
[1:14:56] her husband didn't her husband continued
[1:14:58] like me
[1:14:59] like many other husbands continued with
[1:15:01] coke
[1:15:02] continued with other unhealthy stuff so
[1:15:04] them for coke will forgive me
[1:15:06] they must sue me so
[1:15:10] that lady she was 70 if i'm not mistaken
[1:15:13] or 75
[1:15:15] but she looked like she was 42 or 41.
[1:15:20] only the voice could tell that this lady
[1:15:22] ah she's old
[1:15:24] she was very young but her husband was
[1:15:27] like her grandfather
[1:15:29] so now what exactly is her age
[1:15:33] physically yes she's silent
[1:15:36] but in actual effect biological she's
[1:15:39] very young
[1:15:40] she's very healthy her immune system is
[1:15:42] very strong she can outrun me and you
[1:15:45] but you at the same test event huh
[1:15:48] so the point i'm trying to tell you
[1:15:50] brothers and sisters is that
[1:15:53] your firstborn physically you may not be
[1:15:56] best born in the books of god
[1:15:59] right that is what happened between
[1:16:02] jacob
[1:16:03] and joseph sons that's what happened
[1:16:06] that's what happened between joseph and
[1:16:08] his
[1:16:08] brothers that's what happened between
[1:16:11] israel and the bride
[1:16:13] that's what happened you were not the
[1:16:15] firstborns
[1:16:16] me and you were crafted in and we were
[1:16:19] made
[1:16:20] that was by version of the
[1:16:21] predestination of god
[1:16:23] how he planned you see the mind of god
[1:16:25] it must confuse you
[1:16:27] the devil mustn't come and ask you but
[1:16:29] uh but if god knew
[1:16:31] don't question just believe it because
[1:16:33] if you can try to understand the mind of
[1:16:35] god you will never be able to
[1:16:37] god knew everything and he still allowed
[1:16:41] things to happen that way
[1:16:42] he still yes you were chosen yes you
[1:16:45] were in his mind
[1:16:46] but he still allowed you to come the way
[1:16:48] of the second one who became firstborn
[1:16:52] did anyone get it god allowed it to
[1:16:55] happen that way
[1:16:56] because god wanted to show his plan of
[1:16:58] salvation god wanted to bring out his
[1:17:00] thoughts
[1:17:01] god wanted to bring his power
[1:17:04] to save his power of predestination his
[1:17:07] elective love to take charge and force
[1:17:09] that's what god wanted to do
[1:17:11] between me and you a firstborn
[1:17:15] second bullet a first one is someone who
[1:17:17] has the revelation of the birthright
[1:17:20] if we read about esau who sold his
[1:17:23] birthright in genesis
[1:17:24] 32 we will understand that israel led
[1:17:27] the revelation of the birthright we
[1:17:30] understand that eso did not understand
[1:17:32] that he is the firstborn and he must
[1:17:36] take charge he understood he didn't
[1:17:37] understand
[1:17:39] but jacob understood the power
[1:17:42] and the significance of the first born
[1:17:44] wood
[1:17:45] or the first-born ship he understood it
[1:17:47] that is why he said okay sell it to me

[1:18:19] level of revelation
[1:18:21] can take you and me if we don't realize
[1:18:24] who we are yeah we need to understand
[1:18:27] and get the revelation and get the gist
[1:18:29] of who we are then we cannot
[1:18:32] walk every day and and be angry

[1:19:14] sometimes
[1:19:16] the songwriter said but it will never
[1:19:18] bring me down
[1:19:20] yes ideally we were not even supposed to
[1:19:23] come
[1:19:23] low no but because we are in this place
[1:19:27] for god to prove his weight the lord
[1:19:29] allowed this devil
[1:19:30] to bring us law sometimes but one thing
[1:19:34] for sure
[1:19:35] he will never bring you down even when
[1:19:38] you are down you must never believe that
[1:19:39] you are down
[1:19:40] never confess it i was asking my family
[1:19:44] a question
[1:19:45] i said to them tell me if that you walk
[1:19:48] around the street and you meet the devil
[1:19:51] and the devil says to you hello hello hi
[1:19:53] hi he says
[1:19:54] i'm the devil the very old lucifer liar
[1:19:59] father of liars i asked them and you can
[1:20:02] see that yes that's him
[1:20:05] i say i ask them a question will you
[1:20:07] believe him
[1:20:12] and this is not the new doctrine you
[1:20:14] don't have to believe what i'm saying
[1:20:15] now
[1:20:16] you don't have to to believe agree with
[1:20:18] my answer that's what i mean brother
[1:20:19] james
[1:20:21] but mario don't have to agree but this
[1:20:23] is how i it came to me
[1:20:25] will you believe him and for sure it's
[1:20:27] him you see that
[1:20:28] this is the devil exactly how the bible
[1:20:30] explained it and
[1:20:31] you are you have even made sure you have
[1:20:33] made proof you've proven that this is
[1:20:35] the devil
[1:20:36] we don't believe him let me hear
[1:20:41] will you believe in you i don't want you
[1:20:42] answered because we've already discussed
[1:20:47] i i said to them no no me i can't
[1:20:48] believe it
[1:20:50] because he is a liar
[1:20:53] it is me who must tell him that he is
[1:20:56] the devil
[1:20:57] i must tell him that hey you devil come
[1:20:59] here under my feet
[1:21:00] not him telling me no no no no no no be
[1:21:03] careful
[1:21:04] because the devil never means what he
[1:21:05] says he's a liar in the battle of life
[1:21:08] it could be that he just wants to
[1:21:10] swallow you yeah come on
[1:21:12] the moment the devil will tell you the
[1:21:13] truth know that there is a lie in there
[1:21:17] no matter how hidden it can be because
[1:21:20] he can tell you the truth
[1:21:26] 99.99.99999999999999999998
[1:21:33] 0.000001
[1:21:36] truth or a lie sorry in the
[1:21:39] he just put 0.000
[1:21:44] a lie in there knowing that god does not
[1:21:47] take
[1:21:47] nothing less than 100 percent a clear
[1:21:51] cut hundred percent god will never take
[1:21:53] less than that
[1:21:54] so the devil if he comes to say i am a
[1:21:56] liar i'm the devil
[1:21:58] please come with me can you hear me
[1:22:02] because there's there's an intention
[1:22:04] behind every devil's statement
[1:22:06] he does not just speak to you for
[1:22:08] nothing why would the devil want to
[1:22:09] waste his time
[1:22:10] and can come in your mind and talk to
[1:22:12] you why why why does me and you get evil
[1:22:15] thoughts or wrong thoughts or angry or
[1:22:16] anything
[1:22:17] is the devil at work and we must be
[1:22:20] aware and
[1:22:20] alert at all times with the holy spirit
[1:22:23] must be able to bring us back to the
[1:22:25] stage
[1:22:26] when we say hey come on this is the
[1:22:29] enemy now
[1:22:30] that is why the lord jesus said to peter
[1:22:32] get thee behind me satan
[1:22:33] he was not talking to peter he was
[1:22:35] talking to the devil
[1:22:37] was trying to take advantage of his son
[1:22:39] yeah right
[1:22:40] amen so that is exactly how we need to
[1:22:43] approach the devil that is how i'll
[1:22:44] approach him
[1:22:45] i'll say you can't tell me you said it
[1:22:48] you are satan i'm the one who tells you
[1:22:51] that you are the devil yeah amen
[1:22:53] and another one can say but you have
[1:22:55] said exactly how the devil said
[1:22:56] no i didn't say exactly what the devil
[1:22:58] said because the devil his intention
[1:23:00] had lies had males inside me i was
[1:23:03] telling him the truth
[1:23:04] that he is the devil him he was because
[1:23:08] god reached the heart
[1:23:10] read what you say amen you can tell me
[1:23:12] hey brother paul i love you
[1:23:14] and i say oh brother ed oh my brother i
[1:23:16] forgive you lying
[1:23:18] with open eyes i said brother you know i
[1:23:20] love you so much my brother
[1:23:22] i appreciate you come on
[1:23:26] when my heart does not mean it that's
[1:23:28] how capable the devil is
[1:23:29] he can say hey you know what you are the
[1:23:32] son of didn't he
[1:23:33] to the lord he said to the lord that is
[1:23:36] the son of the most high
[1:23:37] he said drop yourself and the angel will
[1:23:40] pick you up
[1:23:41] why did mata say scripture he's there
[1:23:44] and psalm is there that his food will
[1:23:47] not touch the ground
[1:23:48] the angels will catch him the devil told
[1:23:50] you but the lord said hey
[1:23:52] devil get thee behind for it is written
[1:23:56] you see never believe the devil and no
[1:23:59] matter how truthful he can sound
[1:24:01] appear if he says your brother is like
[1:24:04] this like you
[1:24:04] say you are a liar
[1:24:08] was teaching at the camp there tell him
[1:24:10] put him in his place
[1:24:11] because behind every devil's word there
[1:24:13] is a poison
[1:24:15] there is a poison that me and you must
[1:24:17] watch out for
[1:24:18] and be careful whether he talks to you
[1:24:21] through the sister or through
[1:24:22] another brother or through your mind
[1:24:24] directly
[1:24:26] never believe him that means you must be
[1:24:29] able therefore to know
[1:24:30] the sort of god and the thought of the
[1:24:32] devil and for you to do that
[1:24:34] you must be in a good position to
[1:24:36] understand that you are the firstborn
[1:24:39] how are you going to do you're going to
[1:24:40] confuse like issue
[1:24:42] if you don't know who you are if you
[1:24:45] don't understand
[1:24:46] who you are children when you go to
[1:24:48] school
[1:24:49] there's so many trials and temptations
[1:24:51] there's so many things
[1:24:52] but i said to my children and to you all
[1:24:56] of you my children
[1:24:57] it doesn't matter what the devil does
[1:24:59] you see the drivers will understand me
[1:25:02] when we drive on the road
[1:25:05] our focus is on the our car that we are
[1:25:07] driving number one
[1:25:09] are we together we focus on our car
[1:25:12] that number one i've got the seatbelt
[1:25:15] i'm driving within the speed limit and
[1:25:18] i'm on my lane
[1:25:21] and i'm on the right side of the road
[1:25:23] those are the basic
[1:25:25] things of when i'm driving before i can
[1:25:28] check what other drivers are doing my
[1:25:31] car is on the right lane
[1:25:32] i've got their seatbelt i'm doing the
[1:25:34] right fit limit i've got a seat belt
[1:25:36] everybody in the car is going to sit
[1:25:37] there are you together all i do
[1:25:41] is to maintain my position to maintain
[1:25:44] my speed limit
[1:25:45] if anyone comes and bump it's not my
[1:25:47] fault right is that person's fault
[1:25:49] and i can try to avoid the accident but
[1:25:52] i
[1:25:52] imagine if i get an accident and i'm i'm
[1:25:55] out of my position i'm going that way
[1:25:58] and the cars are going that way yeah
[1:26:00] what will happen that's how the cops
[1:26:01] will not even listen to me the police
[1:26:03] because i'm out of my position yeah you
[1:26:06] must be fast in your opposition
[1:26:09] with the seat belt all right with the
[1:26:12] speed limit
[1:26:13] the moment the police come and find that
[1:26:14] oh you made an accident
[1:26:16] and they see that hi that person
[1:26:19] who had an incident with you is actually
[1:26:21] in the room
[1:26:22] but when they checked with the machines
[1:26:24] and everything they found that you were
[1:26:25] doing 200.
[1:26:28] what will happen yeah yes that person
[1:26:32] bumped you
[1:26:33] that person came from there or he came
[1:26:36] out of his lane and everything
[1:26:37] but what speed were you doing
[1:26:41] oh did you have a seat belt why did you
[1:26:43] fly out of the car
[1:26:45] if you had a seat there you didn't even
[1:26:47] sit there
[1:26:48] that is why i am in the wrong because i
[1:26:51] was not in my
[1:26:52] right position that is exactly how me
[1:26:55] and you should be with the devil
[1:26:56] let's not confuse the devil our thoughts
[1:27:00] with the devil's thoughts especially you
[1:27:01] children because you are at the time
[1:27:03] where you are changing you are learning
[1:27:06] you are learning the things of the devil
[1:27:07] you are watching mama and daddy
[1:27:09] how they do things you are learning you
[1:27:11] are praying that's you're growing
[1:27:13] be careful how that's maintain your
[1:27:16] position all you do you just drive in
[1:27:19] your lane
[1:27:19] within the speed limit you just do
[1:27:21] everything according to the word of god
[1:27:23] then you don't have to worry about 2 000
[1:27:26] pages of the devil's tricks
[1:27:28] don't have to worry about those ones all
[1:27:30] you do you just remain
[1:27:32] keep your five pages of position
[1:27:36] then the devil can come and pump you
[1:27:38] with so many things
[1:27:39] at the end of the day the great judge
[1:27:42] our great police officer the target cop
[1:27:44] will tell him devil you are in the room
[1:27:48] this one is in position he's got your
[1:27:50] seatbelt
[1:27:51] right leg driving within the speed limit
[1:27:54] sit back everything then he's not in the
[1:27:57] room you don't
[1:27:58] go back you are in the room go to jail
[1:28:01] that's what our judge will do to the
[1:28:02] devil but you make it difficult for the
[1:28:05] judge if the judge comes
[1:28:07] and the judge found that ah you are
[1:28:10] actually
[1:28:10] flying in a spirit zone of 50 you ain't
[1:28:13] doing hundred
[1:28:15] then you make it even the devil will say
[1:28:16] you see a lot
[1:28:18] even the devil he's got the gods he will
[1:28:20] even say can you see
[1:28:21] what i told you then he did not take the
[1:28:24] mercies of god
[1:28:25] to say no devil i allowed that you see
[1:28:27] it will take the grace of god now
[1:28:29] to say no no i allowed that to because
[1:28:32] my child is going to confess to me
[1:28:33] listen now
[1:28:34] then you go to the lord and say lord i'm
[1:28:35] sorry i confess i made
[1:28:37] because god if god allows anything in
[1:28:40] your life it is for a reason
[1:28:43] and we must be managed and be controlled
[1:28:45] or be guided by the purpose of god in
[1:28:47] our lives
[1:28:48] that is why some threw the waters some
[1:28:51] through there
[1:28:53] some through the fire but all through
[1:28:56] the blood
[1:28:56] that is why we can never come through
[1:28:59] the same experiences
[1:29:01] right and those experiences god allowed
[1:29:04] them
[1:29:04] i like what isaac thought because it
[1:29:06] really it really moved
[1:29:08] inside me to realize that okay
[1:29:11] i was just dramatizing in my mind
[1:29:13] thinking that okay and god said okay you
[1:29:15] go now you go
[1:29:17] when we go home we're going to realize
[1:29:18] that my my my mind
[1:29:20] has been a long journey things have
[1:29:22] always been like this
[1:29:23] but we are not aware you see that is
[1:29:26] what is going to happen
[1:29:27] let's take the third bullet jesus was
[1:29:29] the first born physically to marry
[1:29:31] so was brother branham i like that
[1:29:33] brother brandon was also the firstborn
[1:29:36] he was the first boy even me i'm the
[1:29:38] firstborn at home
[1:29:41] but that means nothing what means
[1:29:43] something is that you are the firstborn
[1:29:45] also right now because to be a first
[1:29:48] body physically
[1:29:49] is of less significance right to be the
[1:29:51] first one physically
[1:29:52] is of less significance it may be
[1:29:55] important i agree
[1:29:57] but what's the word
[1:30:02] fight i don't have a better way
[1:30:04] persevere to be a first born
[1:30:06] spiritually because that is the most
[1:30:08] significant
[1:30:10] and important first bond sheet that you
[1:30:12] need to
[1:30:13] to fight for joseph was not the physical
[1:30:16] firstborn to jacob
[1:30:17] but he was made by god to be a leader
[1:30:21] but by predestination and elective love
[1:30:23] that's how god made it from the onset
[1:30:26] david also david also was a perfect
[1:30:29] example
[1:30:30] allah is born physically but he becomes
[1:30:33] the king
[1:30:34] the one whom today will talk about
[1:30:37] among big brothers capable intelligent
[1:30:40] well structured people who who were like
[1:30:44] like soul men they were great men but
[1:30:47] david
[1:30:48] god produced needed him to be there
[1:30:51] i can say spiritual firstborn
[1:30:53] confidently speaking i can say that way
[1:30:55] because
[1:30:55] that's how god made him to be and god
[1:30:58] used him throughout
[1:31:00] saint joseph there joseph sons as we
[1:31:02] have read in the scripture
[1:31:04] are we together so israel was made blind
[1:31:07] for you
[1:31:07] and for me we were crafted in i know
[1:31:10] these things you know them
[1:31:12] the purpose is to refresh you tonight we
[1:31:15] click on the computer then we click
[1:31:16] refresh why
[1:31:19] so that the computer can update the
[1:31:21] computer can save things
[1:31:23] the computer can do everything must be
[1:31:25] up otherwise if the demo comes
[1:31:27] you are going to lose everything that
[1:31:28] you timed the whole day
[1:31:31] imagine imagine mama chisol you don't
[1:31:34] save
[1:31:34] that chapter it's a problem you always
[1:31:38] must click refresh
[1:31:39] in fact they make the computer nowadays
[1:31:42] to have an auto save
[1:31:46] in my days we used to have you must
[1:31:48] always click
[1:31:50] save save save otherwise you lose
[1:31:53] thousands and thousands of spreadsheets
[1:31:55] having a lot of work and that's how the
[1:31:58] devil went
[1:31:58] he wants you to work so hard at the end
[1:32:01] he just
[1:32:02] confused the computer and it freezes and
[1:32:05] you lose everything that you have worked
[1:32:06] for
[1:32:08] all your efforts all your dedication
[1:32:10] everything be careful young people
[1:32:12] the devil wants you to lose all the data
[1:32:15] that you you have worked so hard for the
[1:32:17] devil wants to lose
[1:32:18] your best life the devil wants you to
[1:32:21] lose
[1:32:22] a free gift of life to be born in the
[1:32:25] message
[1:32:26] family many people who are not born in
[1:32:29] the message family
[1:32:30] many i was privileged to be born but i
[1:32:34] also realized late man
[1:32:35] that i was so blessed i was so
[1:32:38] in the lab in the world till i was so
[1:32:40] lucky you children you are so
[1:32:42] blessed to be born by
[1:32:46] believing brothers that's right because
[1:32:48] mothers and fathers
[1:32:50] because you are like someone who already
[1:32:52] somebody has run a race for you
[1:32:54] you are taking it halfway through so
[1:32:57] your job is to run as if you are dead
[1:32:59] and run faster before the devil catches
[1:33:03] you
[1:33:03] that's what you young people must do and
[1:33:06] that's what all of us
[1:33:07] should do because the lord jesus has
[1:33:09] already done it for us
[1:33:11] the real first born has already done it
[1:33:13] for us
[1:33:14] me and you we got this message for free
[1:33:17] we got this word for free
[1:33:19] he we never went looking for god amen
[1:33:22] we never never none of us went out with
[1:33:26] his own effort
[1:33:27] god came looking for us and he found us
[1:33:31] and he brought his way to us and he
[1:33:34] pulled us
[1:33:35] no brother indeed it was him amen who
[1:33:38] pulled you
[1:33:39] and you didn't understand yourself but
[1:33:41] eventually you realize that oh my i'm a
[1:33:44] son
[1:33:44] of the living god that's what happened
[1:33:47] to me
[1:33:48] and to you that's what happened
[1:33:50] therefore brothers and sisters
[1:33:52] it is important for us to understand the
[1:33:55] meaning
[1:33:56] of the firstborn let's hear what the
[1:33:58] prophet says there
[1:33:59] let's get to the second point the first
[1:34:01] point that we were talking about
[1:34:03] what's about the first board so let's
[1:34:04] talk about the tithes of the lord
[1:34:06] brother branham in the spoken word
[1:34:08] uh images of christ oh there i have it i
[1:34:10] forgot
[1:34:11] he says oh lord
[1:34:15] you are god and your god forevermore and
[1:34:18] we are so happy to know that you've
[1:34:20] you promised that you would have a
[1:34:22] remnant when you come to earth to the
[1:34:25] earth
[1:34:26] regardless of what goes or comes there
[1:34:28] is going to be people that's going to be
[1:34:30] ready
[1:34:32] we know that there is this there is a
[1:34:35] tithing that
[1:34:36] man gives to god and there is a tight
[1:34:39] thing amongst
[1:34:40] the people now this is now
[1:34:43] what fascinates me i spoke to brother
[1:34:45] then i can't remember the ending
[1:34:47] about these types many times we talk
[1:34:50] about tithes
[1:34:51] and then we give our tithes in church
[1:34:53] which is wonderful that's a scripture
[1:34:55] that's an obligation by the way that's
[1:34:57] on the physical side
[1:34:58] but it is called spiritual meaning as i
[1:35:01] said
[1:35:02] the physical types they're spiritual
[1:35:03] there are shadows and types right
[1:35:06] listen listen the shadow of jesus christ
[1:35:10] physically was so powerful in the shadow
[1:35:14] the shadow of the lord jesus some people
[1:35:16] they just wanted even just to touch a
[1:35:18] shadow
[1:35:19] and be healed that lady
[1:35:22] who wanted to touch the helm of hitman
[1:35:25] she didn't want to greet him
[1:35:26] and hug no she just wanted to touch the
[1:35:29] hem
[1:35:29] right some people the apostles they were
[1:35:32] just walking and people just touched
[1:35:34] their shadows and they got healed
[1:35:36] so how much more about the shadow of the
[1:35:38] lord jesus christ
[1:35:39] how much more about this shadow that is
[1:35:42] called
[1:35:42] the new and the old testament the things
[1:35:45] that are happening
[1:35:46] in the old testament the shadows are
[1:35:48] powerful men because they come from the
[1:35:50] mouth of god
[1:35:50] but they are still shadows but they are
[1:35:52] powerful right
[1:35:54] now is enticed and we pay tithes and and
[1:35:57] did you know
[1:35:58] that you and me are the tithes of god
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:02] we are the times of god you know we and
[1:36:04] we are not the ned
[1:36:05] tithes we are the gross i don't know
[1:36:08] does any one of you want to be a gross
[1:36:09] type
[1:36:11] i i want to be a i mean i want to be a
[1:36:13] net
[1:36:15] i i'm not bringing i'm not i'm not here
[1:36:17] to encourage you to
[1:36:18] to go cross or native because
[1:36:22] there's people argue about that but i am
[1:36:24] a gross tithe
[1:36:26] you choose which ties you want if you
[1:36:28] are the type of eyes of god
[1:36:30] you you choose whether you want to be a
[1:36:32] gross
[1:36:33] or a name but me i'm a gross all right
[1:36:38] because because
[1:36:43] can i tell you why can i tell you what
[1:36:46] because you jesus christ did not pay you
[1:36:49] as a tithe amen he did not bring
[1:36:53] half of you and the power he brought you
[1:36:55] complete
[1:36:57] without reservation he brought you a
[1:36:59] full fresh tithe
[1:37:01] before the father and he said this is my
[1:37:03] time you are the
[1:37:04] the
[1:37:09] the lord jesus you are also that she
[1:37:12] so i'm not saying go now and change your
[1:37:15] you can do it but i'm just saying gross
[1:37:19] or ned it's up to you
[1:37:22] i want to be the growth
[1:37:25] if if we agree as the prophet says today
[1:37:28] that perhaps maybe we would say a tenth
[1:37:32] of
[1:37:32] all the world's harvest through the ages
[1:37:35] will be the elect
[1:37:36] that has been called that means the
[1:37:39] bride is the tigers
[1:37:41] the pride is the tithe of the lord the
[1:37:43] pride
[1:37:44] abraham gave time to melchizedek all our
[1:37:47] forefathers have paid tithes
[1:37:50] now when when they were paying tithes
[1:37:53] through their harvests through their
[1:37:57] uh plowing and that i remember my father
[1:38:00] paying
[1:38:00] a cow and he called the deacons to come
[1:38:03] and say
[1:38:04] the one that come he didn't say no no i
[1:38:05] want to give that one no
[1:38:08] i learned from the from him that time he
[1:38:10] said you can't come
[1:38:12] the tenth cow is the tithe of the lord
[1:38:14] and he gave it to the church
[1:38:16] that was a great lesson for me he
[1:38:18] allowed the cows to come out of the
[1:38:19] kettle i'm in the crawl
[1:38:21] they come one by one that the one that
[1:38:23] came number 10 is it is that one the
[1:38:25] lord chose for himself
[1:38:26] but nowadays we want to say no no no you
[1:38:30] just look at the one that is skinny over
[1:38:32] and you want to give the lord a skinny
[1:38:34] one
[1:38:35] i don't know time to be hard on you but
[1:38:38] that skinny one to me looks like the net
[1:38:43] i'm sorry to say that just eat the meat
[1:38:47] and leave the bones are we together the
[1:38:50] point that i'm trying to bring to you
[1:38:52] is that we need to do the best of the
[1:38:54] best for the lord
[1:38:56] if the tithes is
[1:39:00] the bride if abraham
[1:39:03] paid tithes what portion did abraham
[1:39:06] if abraham did abraham pay gross on it
[1:39:10] and that's not my sermon tonight about
[1:39:11] grosses and nets and all that i don't
[1:39:13] know why i keep on emphasizing money but
[1:39:14] the point is
[1:39:16] up in those days there was no tax in
[1:39:18] that sense
[1:39:20] so how how how did they give to the lord
[1:39:22] when they harvested 100 bags of meat
[1:39:24] of course i'm a farmer now here brother
[1:39:28] phil
[1:39:29] i i make 1 000 picks
[1:39:34] and now i want to convert it to because
[1:39:37] nowadays i have to deal with cash isn't
[1:39:38] it
[1:39:38] i must convert those picks to cash so
[1:39:40] that i can fight for the lord
[1:39:42] but had it been literal peaks how was i
[1:39:45] going to deduct cross or
[1:39:48] how it was going to be gross
[1:39:52] but now when i catch those peaks of mine
[1:39:55] to cash now i want to
[1:40:02] are we together that's not the point the
[1:40:04] point is
[1:40:06] perhaps maybe we would say a tenth of
[1:40:09] all the world's harvest
[1:40:10] through the ages will be the elected
[1:40:13] that's been
[1:40:14] called today we are the tithes of the
[1:40:18] lord brothers and sisters
[1:40:19] and the lord did not limit his hand he
[1:40:22] gave us everything
[1:40:23] because we are the bride because we are
[1:40:25] the tithe of the lord
[1:40:27] he he made sure that that church will be
[1:40:29] without spot
[1:40:30] without wrangle without blame without
[1:40:32] the christian mark
[1:40:33] from the devil i taught myself from a
[1:40:35] young age that
[1:40:37] if there's anything that i don't
[1:40:38] understand for the lord for example
[1:40:40] issues of ties and everything and
[1:40:41] arguments and we don't know we debate
[1:40:43] people who can spend sleepless nights
[1:40:45] debating and all our argument will make
[1:40:47] sense
[1:40:47] now we can debate that and we can listen
[1:40:50] at the end of the day
[1:40:51] it's going to be who has got the most
[1:40:53] powerful reasoning capacity
[1:40:55] is the one who wins right but the point
[1:40:58] of the matter is that
[1:40:59] if i don't understand or i don't get
[1:41:02] things
[1:41:03] isn't it let's say let's say let's say
[1:41:05] let's let me use another
[1:41:06] this same example of time let's say
[1:41:09] about ties and everything
[1:41:10] and then i say no no but i can't okay
[1:41:13] okay i don't understand gross or not i
[1:41:15] mean i called me and said to me
[1:41:17] they're at your church not here i was
[1:41:19] begging south africa fellowship in some
[1:41:20] way hey brother calls me and say
[1:41:22] because his wife was fellowshipping
[1:41:24] there he was not fellowshipping them
[1:41:26] and i was trusting at the time
[1:41:29] he says how are you managing the tithes
[1:41:32] because he was not happy
[1:41:34] i said no my brother the lord the holy
[1:41:35] spirit must guide you i can't tell you
[1:41:37] how
[1:41:38] and then he said no but you are doing
[1:41:39] you are telling people to do gross i
[1:41:41] said no no no we are not
[1:41:43] you're not you need to speak to your
[1:41:44] wife perhaps then then we can address it
[1:41:46] the two of you because i cannot address
[1:41:48] issues of your family or personal
[1:41:50] revelation for you
[1:41:51] and for your wife and everything but the
[1:41:53] point of the matter is that
[1:41:54] if you don't understand there's an
[1:41:58] argument i give you two choices
[1:42:01] the first one we are not sure about is
[1:42:03] what i must be made
[1:42:04] the final one is what that must be gross
[1:42:07] and if you do not the bible says
[1:42:09] if you do not and then you find at the
[1:42:11] end that you are wrong
[1:42:14] are you going to reverse now when we are
[1:42:15] already on the other side
[1:42:18] but you are safe if you can go gross and
[1:42:21] you find that you were wrong
[1:42:22] you are still safe the lord will say
[1:42:24] what a wonderful child you are
[1:42:26] because you you you you did what you
[1:42:29] called you mitigated your risk so well
[1:42:32] to say hi i'm not sure but
[1:42:35] if it is led
[1:42:38] then it's fine because of doing it to
[1:42:40] the lord but it is it is
[1:42:42] gross so what i want to say is that if
[1:42:44] it is
[1:42:45] gross and then i given him lead and i
[1:42:48] found to be wrong
[1:42:51] now then i cannot reverse now what i'm
[1:42:53] trying to say to you
[1:42:55] let's come to the spiritual let's stop
[1:42:57] thinking about money
[1:42:58] physical let's come to the spiritual now
[1:43:00] let us give the lord
[1:43:01] cross of our lives yes let's give the
[1:43:05] lord gross
[1:43:06] of everything that we have let's not
[1:43:08] limit the lord spiritually now i'm
[1:43:09] talking about
[1:43:11] right i'm not talking about salaries
[1:43:12] let's talk about the growth of spiritual
[1:43:15] lives let's give the lord full maximum
[1:43:18] more if possible because
[1:43:22] you will be blessed for going what you
[1:43:24] call it an
[1:43:25] extra mile for the lord the lord won't
[1:43:28] punish you
[1:43:29] the lord won't blame you for giving him
[1:43:31] grace but the lord will ask you
[1:43:33] why did you do so little when you could
[1:43:35] have done so much
[1:43:38] the lord will ask you and say my boy my
[1:43:39] daughter why
[1:43:41] i'm not happy with you you say hey lord
[1:43:43] yeah
[1:43:44] man i was busy hey no no no no no no no
[1:43:47] no it's ending he made me angry
[1:43:49] no his sister bro when he didn't talk to
[1:43:50] me properly
[1:43:52] when i could have given gross and
[1:43:53] encapsulated her with my love
[1:43:56] and and forgiven her unconditionally and
[1:43:58] i loved her
[1:44:00] without her telling me that she asked
[1:44:01] for forgiveness love her
[1:44:03] oh my brother my sister i don't know why
[1:44:05] i keep on talking about loving it
[1:44:07] you know it's just that it comes so
[1:44:09] strong to me that
[1:44:11] love even people who just call
[1:44:14] themselves christians
[1:44:16] who just denominational people
[1:44:20] they know that the love of god is so
[1:44:22] great
[1:44:23] they make even songs and say love can
[1:44:25] change the world
[1:44:26] if sun can t sun can turn into a
[1:44:30] if sand can turn into a pearl or a
[1:44:33] sister if pelican
[1:44:35] sun can turn into policy beautiful name
[1:44:37] sand can turn into pearl and a coal
[1:44:40] can turn into diamonds and they make
[1:44:42] poems and say
[1:44:43] love can change the world yeah they are
[1:44:45] just talking about
[1:44:46] love physical love you know loving one
[1:44:48] another how much the love of god can do
[1:44:52] i'm closing now
[1:44:56] when the negatives becomes the positives
[1:44:58] again when nothing becomes something
[1:45:01] that is what happens all the negatives
[1:45:04] when they become positives
[1:45:06] we start to see our reality of being the
[1:45:09] firstborn
[1:45:10] we start to understand he cometh from
[1:45:13] like
[1:45:13] a flower and is cut down
[1:45:16] he inflates also as a shadow
[1:45:20] and a continuous note that is job
[1:45:22] chapter four if i'm not mistaken i think
[1:45:25] it's job chapter four i forgot to put it
[1:45:26] there
[1:45:27] but now we are leaving a shadow life
[1:45:30] here and we must understand that there's
[1:45:33] coming a time
[1:45:34] of reality this reality that we are
[1:45:37] living here
[1:45:38] brother ben taught us that the real
[1:45:40] reality
[1:45:42] is coming and we are just on the shadows
[1:45:45] of it
[1:45:46] right now when we are on the shadow we
[1:45:48] are so close
[1:45:50] i've never seen a shadow that is far
[1:45:52] from this object
[1:45:54] a shadow is so close when when i do this
[1:45:57] my shadow also do this
[1:46:00] when i jump my shadow jumps that is the
[1:46:02] shadow
[1:46:03] it gives you a true reflection of
[1:46:05] reality a shadow
[1:46:07] so ah while we are here in this life
[1:46:10] being a shadow
[1:46:11] shadowing the real love that is coming
[1:46:13] the reflection must be of reality
[1:46:16] all the time are we together the shadow
[1:46:19] cannot be able to do something
[1:46:21] and then the reality do something we
[1:46:23] reflect heaven while we are
[1:46:25] here everything happens as if
[1:46:28] we are already in that is why we say
[1:46:31] we are in the bright age we fly high
[1:46:34] like eagles
[1:46:35] because we our shadow takes from some
[1:46:38] way
[1:46:39] that is what's happening now i want to
[1:46:41] show you for those
[1:46:43] for those who are who are
[1:46:46] older will know that picture you see in
[1:46:49] those days

[1:47:14] i'm going to tell you what this is this
[1:47:17] is
[1:47:17] a shadow it's what we call a negative of
[1:47:20] reality it's a negative of a shadow
[1:47:23] in the early days our cameras were not
[1:47:25] digital they were not
[1:47:26] taking you a selfie now and you print
[1:47:28] now already digitized
[1:47:29] no everything was manual and we had
[1:47:33] shadows this is called a negative film
[1:47:36] that comes from a from a film membrane
[1:47:38] that is a
[1:47:39] big role that was in the film and you
[1:47:41] take pictures
[1:47:43] and you move pictures and they improve
[1:47:45] the then it goes to be developed
[1:47:48] when it goes to be developed on my
[1:47:50] shadow is why are you there
[1:47:52] sorry there is worry there on the
[1:47:54] picture there but that's why

[1:48:43] we print them from a developer and you
[1:48:46] come with
[1:48:47] yeah an image like this those days we
[1:48:50] didn't have computers to put this we put
[1:48:52] this in photo albums big ones and small
[1:48:54] ones

[1:48:59] it comes out like this you say ah
[1:49:02] what's that brother more on that picture
[1:49:05] i thought it was his brother
[1:49:06] on the shadow because the shadow will
[1:49:09] never tell you exactly
[1:49:10] right but you can see that ah that
[1:49:12] resemblance looks like brother moon

[1:49:17] looks like sister
[1:49:18] brother p you can see that ah yeah but
[1:49:21] what is
[1:49:22] only when the printout comes then you
[1:49:25] see the reality
[1:49:26] of the shadow but meanwhile the shadow
[1:49:29] shows a little bit of this because
[1:49:33] everything that is in that shadow is
[1:49:36] going to come on the
[1:49:37] picture are we together that is the
[1:49:40] picture of
[1:49:43] earth and we love our earth just that is
[1:49:46] getting destroyed but we love it it's a
[1:49:48] beautiful planet
[1:49:49] we love it but it's just part of the
[1:49:52] shadow that of the earth that is coming
[1:49:54] yeah it's only a picture it's only a
[1:49:56] shadow
[1:49:57] the real earth is not gonna look like
[1:49:59] this i don't think so

[1:50:04] that
[1:50:04] you see there they see everywhere waves

[1:50:32] we are absolutely small and we are
[1:50:36] absolutely can i say nothing
[1:50:41] until the lord jesus christ came amen
[1:50:44] you're nothing
[1:50:45] so nothing we are that even our own
[1:50:48] earth that one
[1:50:50] is absolutely nothing
[1:50:53] looking who knows that picture
[1:50:57] that picture that picture they say is
[1:50:59] that is the image of our galaxy
[1:51:03] our galaxy is
[1:51:06] a body of billions and billions of
[1:51:10] planets and bodies in this in the
[1:51:13] universe there
[1:51:14] we are part of it our solar system is
[1:51:17] part of
[1:51:17] it our solar system is part of that
[1:51:20] galaxy that that galaxy is so huge
[1:51:24] that to move from that point
[1:51:29] to that point they say you will take 100
[1:51:32] years
[1:51:33] one hundred thousand years sorry one
[1:51:36] hundred thousand years
[1:51:38] to travel and you know how fast must you
[1:51:40] be traveling
[1:51:41] you must be traveling at a speed of 186
[1:51:45] 000 a mile per second
[1:51:48] which is the speed of light you must be
[1:51:51] traveling at 186 000
[1:51:54] miles
[1:51:58] a second to travel from there
[1:52:03] today and do you know what
[1:52:06] in there in that planet in in that
[1:52:09] galaxy
[1:52:10] there is before we go there this galaxy
[1:52:14] there is many other galaxies billions of
[1:52:17] them
[1:52:18] oh my this makes you mad now there is
[1:52:21] billions of these galaxies
[1:52:22] billions nobody will ever reach them
[1:52:25] they just think and tell us
[1:52:26] an imaginary picture and say maybe send
[1:52:28] pictures and and then build up an image
[1:52:30] like that
[1:52:30] this could be closer to the reality
[1:52:34] but there are billions and billions
[1:52:37] and billions of other galaxies
[1:52:41] now our solar system is maybe in this
[1:52:44] area
[1:52:45] here somewhere and you know where is our
[1:52:47] earth our earth is here you see this dot
[1:52:52] this distance this one
[1:52:56] is here
[1:53:01] somewhere there sorry i can't expand it
[1:53:03] further but
[1:53:04] this one that we love so much it's there
[1:53:08] it's there and can i tell you something
[1:53:13] inside there that earth day there is
[1:53:16] you hey man
[1:53:19] and there is me on that door today maybe
[1:53:26] i can cover even
[1:53:27] our earth with my with my hand
[1:53:31] there is earth there where i put my hand
[1:53:35] in that earth that can be covered by
[1:53:37] this on that image
[1:53:38] there is me so how small am i
[1:53:44] i'm not trying to make you like small
[1:53:46] i'm just trying to help you
[1:53:48] to realize that you are small
[1:53:53] and i am small i'm just trying to assist
[1:53:56] you that i am very
[1:53:58] small but let me tell you the good news
[1:54:02] the good news is my lord jesus
[1:54:07] my lord jesus your lord jesus have seen
[1:54:10] that smallness
[1:54:12] and then he decided to come and dwell in
[1:54:15] that smallness
[1:54:17] to make you the first born
[1:54:21] now you are bigger than the billions and
[1:54:24] billions
[1:54:24] and billions of universes you are going
[1:54:28] to travel
[1:54:29] with the speed maybe more than life
[1:54:32] when we go home because that's the
[1:54:34] fastest we know now
[1:54:36] we're not dead now but when we go home
[1:54:39] sister vanessa
[1:54:40] we are going to travel perhaps more than
[1:54:42] that
[1:54:44] so which means we are even going to see
[1:54:46] our own universes
[1:54:50] that's what you are isn't it something
[1:54:52] that we are supposed to be grateful for
[1:54:54] that is why this video of this guy when
[1:54:56] i watched it i cried man
[1:54:58] because he described me so well he
[1:55:00] explained it so nice
[1:55:02] and i was waiting for an opportunity you
[1:55:05] know
[1:55:06] to tell you about it because it's so
[1:55:09] much
[1:55:09] powerful it's so powerful that
[1:55:12] in this nothingness that i am
[1:55:16] god decided to make me
[1:55:19] to make you something to never ever
[1:55:23] underestimate what is inside you yeah
[1:55:27] if you undermine yourself or you
[1:55:29] disregard yourself
[1:55:30] just do me a favor one favor
[1:55:33] at least respect and uplift your god
[1:55:36] that is in you
[1:55:38] hallelujah because there is a god inside
[1:55:40] you
[1:55:41] he needs to be comfortable he needs to
[1:55:44] be
[1:55:44] happy he need to produce things inside
[1:55:47] your life
[1:55:48] therefore i don't have time to make him
[1:55:50] uncomfortable
[1:55:52] i don't have the time to make god
[1:55:54] uncomfortable in my life amen
[1:55:56] if i fault her i must stand up amen
[1:56:00] if you fought up you stand up and say
[1:56:02] lord i can't
[1:56:04] not after having done this not after
[1:56:07] having
[1:56:08] done what you have done i don't believe
[1:56:10] they'll ever discover how big the
[1:56:12] universe is
[1:56:12] that's right i i personally think and
[1:56:15] this is not a new doctrine
[1:56:16] but i think it is it's endless right i
[1:56:19] don't want to say eternal but that's
[1:56:20] what it means
[1:56:21] i don't think your universe will ever
[1:56:23] finish it
[1:56:25] because the negatives
[1:56:28] types there in my view in my books
[1:56:32] i don't think they'll finish the
[1:56:33] universe but they'll find out that the
[1:56:35] universe starts from here and here
[1:56:38] i don't think you'll ever find it i
[1:56:40] think it's so fast
[1:56:41] it symbolizes eternity of god because
[1:56:44] nobody
[1:56:45] will ever exhaust the eternity
[1:56:48] of god and that is your life
[1:56:52] man when i come to you with a check
[1:56:57] this is yours like eternal life
[1:57:01] yours and it's given to you
[1:57:04] and and that is by the god who makes
[1:57:07] these things
[1:57:08] who made these things the bible says he
[1:57:10] spoke and they came out of his mouth
[1:57:13] all those things i mean who is mankind
[1:57:16] yeah that me and you who is the devil
[1:57:21] to trick you to be allowed to be to
[1:57:24] trick me
[1:57:25] and you no he must never be given that
[1:57:28] opportunity
[1:57:29] let me die in my boots fighting
[1:57:33] let me die and that's my message for
[1:57:35] tonight brothers and sisters
[1:57:36] that let us realize who we are yeah
[1:57:39] let's understand maybe some other time
[1:57:40] the lord will give me more
[1:57:42] about this fascinating first born
[1:57:45] ministry
[1:57:46] or mystery that i love so much the way i
[1:57:48] love you so much
[1:57:49] the first time i met vanessa i told her
[1:57:53] here in new zealand it was just a few
[1:57:55] days and we were chatting and my brother
[1:57:57] chris remember my sister
[1:57:58] and i was sharing with her about the
[1:58:00] firstborn because
[1:58:02] it just moves me and i don't know how to
[1:58:05] express it
[1:58:06] i was preaching to my daughter many
[1:58:08] years ago we were driving going
[1:58:09] somewhere in south africa we were
[1:58:11] driving i think i was going to drop here
[1:58:12] somewhere i said you know what let me
[1:58:13] tell you something
[1:58:14] can i preach to you she says yes then i
[1:58:16] start to preach to her about the
[1:58:18] purpose of the first born and what it
[1:58:20] means
[1:58:22] so you are not just people yeah
[1:58:25] me and you are not just people not with
[1:58:28] pride
[1:58:29] because pride is not found in the first
[1:58:31] born no pride
[1:58:33] but you are just saying who you are yes
[1:58:36] that's who you are that's who
[1:58:39] i am and nobody can change it no devil
[1:58:43] can change you so have you said that
[1:58:46] i'll repeat the voice over the bell if
[1:58:48] you are going to fight a battle
[1:58:50] and you you are told that before you
[1:58:52] start you have one how is how are you
[1:58:54] going to react
[1:58:58] you before you start they say are you
[1:59:00] don't worry
[1:59:01] that's your crown that one is your crown
[1:59:04] but you need just for project call you
[1:59:06] know phil you have to run
[1:59:09] you just have to run this race no for
[1:59:10] protocol but you have already been given
[1:59:12] this is already yours let's just give
[1:59:14] you a taste then they just
[1:59:16] give you a taste you say this is when i
[1:59:18] touch it when you touch it
[1:59:20] you know that's how brother brandon went
[1:59:22] overview in the kitchen of time he was
[1:59:24] going to touch what you're going to have
[1:59:25] for us
[1:59:26] and then you know we said you men of god
[1:59:28] you went there he said yes
[1:59:31] he's just giving the earnest that's the
[1:59:33] feeling
[1:59:34] these bodies can't take if he gives us
[1:59:36] all now but
[1:59:38] once we change our bodies that's what
[1:59:40] you're going to get how will you react
[1:59:42] if they tell you no you have won the
[1:59:45] battle already
[1:59:46] i'm telling you you'll pray every day
[1:59:50] you read your bible every day without
[1:59:52] feeling compelled
[1:59:54] just with excitement and happiness
[1:59:56] you'll pray
[1:59:58] because when i think of the goodness of
[2:00:02] jesus and all
[2:00:05] he has done for me
[2:00:08] my very soul cries out hallelujah
[2:00:14] praise god for saving me
[2:00:17] because nothing can stop you when you
[2:00:19] think of the goodness of jesus
[2:00:21] this little mind of mine when he thinks
[2:00:23] of death
[2:00:24] my great mind propels me
[2:00:27] that nothing should discourage you
[2:00:32] you should always know pasta when you
[2:00:34] are down there in the south island
[2:00:36] that i am a daughter of the most high
[2:00:38] god
[2:00:40] last story when we go home a young man
[2:00:43] who was taken to slavery to slavery in
[2:00:45] america
[2:00:46] the prophet talks about him they took
[2:00:48] him by force together with other people
[2:00:51] and they were taken to a land far off in
[2:00:53] america and he was a slave with other
[2:00:55] slaves
[2:00:56] beaten no more hope and for going back
[2:00:59] home to your motherland
[2:01:01] sure that you're going to die here
[2:01:04] because there was no airplane perhaps
[2:01:06] there was nothing you were trapped he
[2:01:09] was a slave
[2:01:10] but you know what this young man
[2:01:14] when he was there he did not walk like a
[2:01:16] slave
[2:01:18] he did not talk behave like a slave
[2:01:21] he did not conduct himself like a slave
[2:01:24] no no no no until another
[2:01:28] buyer came to buy slaves he he chose
[2:01:31] that i want to buy that slave
[2:01:33] and the owner said no no no no that one
[2:01:35] is not for sale
[2:01:36] he said no no why i want to buy him he
[2:01:39] said no
[2:01:40] i'm dead serious i don't want your money
[2:01:42] i'm sure he added more money
[2:01:44] right he said no i don't want last one
[2:01:46] is not for sale
[2:01:47] he said just tell me why do you treat
[2:01:50] him special have you trained him he said
[2:01:51] no
[2:01:52] i did nothing to him do you give him
[2:01:54] special food he said no no no
[2:01:56] he eat just like all other slaves so why
[2:01:59] is he like that
[2:02:01] he said my friend it took me a long time
[2:02:05] also to realize but when i came to
[2:02:07] realize
[2:02:08] i realized and i saw that that young man
[2:02:12] where he comes from back in his mother
[2:02:15] country in his home country
[2:02:17] he is a son of a chief or a ki
[2:02:21] so when he's here in slavery land
[2:02:25] he behaves himself and conducts himself
[2:02:27] like a son of the king
[2:02:29] when he walks when he talks when he do
[2:02:33] everything he behaves like the son of
[2:02:36] the king
[2:02:37] you know david david was not ashamed
[2:02:41] in front of the multitudes of israel to
[2:02:43] say i am sorry me your king i have
[2:02:45] sinned before god
[2:02:46] right and i don't deserve any better
[2:02:49] i deserve to be punished and to die that
[2:02:52] was the attitude
[2:02:53] of the son of king so that young man
[2:02:56] he walked talked
[2:03:00] everything he did as if he was
[2:03:03] at home because he knew
[2:03:06] that where i come from my father i'm a
[2:03:09] king at home
[2:03:11] he knew that i'm a son of the king and
[2:03:13] me as the firstborn
[2:03:15] when my father dies i am the king i
[2:03:18] might be here in slavery land i might
[2:03:20] die here
[2:03:21] but back home my name is raining high
[2:03:25] so you could be here but there's a much
[2:03:28] bigger hope than that slavery slave boy
[2:03:31] because you very soon he promised that
[2:03:34] he's coming
[2:03:35] next year this time i'm coming for you
[2:03:39] be ready you know the story of
[2:03:41] cinderella
[2:03:42] how many noises next year i come
[2:03:47] you must be ready therefore whenever she
[2:03:50] was working doing everything she was
[2:03:52] conducting himself like
[2:03:54] i said queen a queen
[2:03:57] that is my message by the grace of god
[2:04:00] this evening
[2:04:02] because you are the first ones
[2:04:05] you are the tithes of god you have been
[2:04:09] punished
[2:04:10] properly with pride good pride
[2:04:13] to the lord here am i lord i am your
[2:04:16] tithe
[2:04:18] so that the lord can use you to bring
[2:04:21] tens
[2:04:21] and thousands of other souls
[2:04:24] to his kingdom for his honor and for his
[2:04:27] glory
[2:04:28] that is the god who made that
[2:04:32] our god let's leave hands for the lord
