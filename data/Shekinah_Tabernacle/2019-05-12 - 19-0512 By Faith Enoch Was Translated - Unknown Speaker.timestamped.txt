[50:33] of right now I mean so um let's go to
[50:37] John chapter 14 so I'm just trying to
[50:39] get this remote going now that's not me
[50:57] technology it was working it was happy
[51:03] to be a believer he's happy to be alive
[51:06] oh yeah I'm glad to be alive thank you
[51:10] for your prayers and although how are
[51:12] you what's EPS and praying for you and I
[51:14] I appreciate it so thank you okay yep
[51:17] I'm driving hold on amen John 14 verses
[51:21] one two three let not your heart be
[51:24] troubled ye believe in God believe also
[51:28] on me and my father's house are many
[51:30] mansions therefore not so I would have
[51:34] told you I'd go to prepare a place for
[51:37] you and if I go and prepare a place for
[51:40] you I will come again and receive you
[51:43] unto myself that where I am NOT where
[51:47] you are but where he is an eternity
[51:51] there ye may be also
[51:54] Olu yeah let's go to Hebrews 11 and
[51:58] we're gonna read verses 1 & 2 and I'm
[52:00] going to drop down to verse 5 this is
[52:07] this here our faith just wait for the
[52:14] paper to see some rustling I've been in
[52:17] the store all week I pray the Lord
[52:20] really grips our hearts
[52:24] we're not here just to go through church
[52:25] and go through life and you know we're
[52:28] here there's a people the Bible says
[52:30] that people that will that are on the
[52:31] earth it will not taste death they will
[52:34] be taken they will walk with God and
[52:36] will be not because God took them and I
[52:38] believe according to the scripture we
[52:41] are we are those people every conditions
[52:44] here everything's here for it to happen
[52:46] I believe that I'm looking at people
[52:48] that are going to fulfill the promise
[52:51] that in a moment of twinkling of an eye
[52:53] I mean this mortality will put on
[52:55] immortality
[52:56] it'll happen before you realize it it
[52:59] means this is now faith is the substance
[53:00] of things hoped for the evidence of
[53:04] things not seen for by it the elders
[53:06] obtained a good report now let's drop
[53:09] down to verse 5 by faith Enoch was
[53:12] translated that he should not see death
[53:15] and was not found because God had
[53:17] translated him for before his
[53:20] translation he had this testimony that
[53:23] he pleased God I mean may the Lord bless
[53:26] us would you may have your seats today
[53:29] now I want to just you know these well
[53:37] these many moments where you feel very
[53:38] insufficient and this is very much one
[53:40] of those moments but I want to take just
[53:43] from from now faith and I'm gonna go on
[53:48] to this but the rapture has to be a
[53:50] revelation to you as I think brother ed
[53:54] said this walk is individual it's not a
[53:56] group walk a ment we know there is the
[53:59] Bride of Christ as a group but it's all
[54:00] made up of individuals and God deals
[54:02] with individuals God calls individuals
[54:04] amen so the rapture has to be a
[54:08] revelation it has to be revealed to you
[54:10] that you're going in the rapture and
[54:12] you're part of the rapture amen brother
[54:15] Bram said pray for revelation more than
[54:18] anything right
[54:20] so now faith and okay I'm just gonna
[54:23] make a bit of a just what do you call it
[54:26] introduction or whatever so you know
[54:27] where I'm going faith is the substance
[54:29] of things hoped for so it's it's
[54:32] actually a substance of something you're
[54:34] hoping for it's not it's not a stab in
[54:36] the dark well I believe it's
[54:37] happen you actually know it's going to
[54:40] happen you actually have the certainty
[54:42] in your soul you know it's going to
[54:44] happen so it's the substance of
[54:46] something hopeful in that word hope
[54:48] there's an expectation usually with
[54:50] pleasure so faith is the substance of
[54:52] something that you're expecting right
[54:55] it's the evidence of things not seen so
[54:57] it's the evidence is the proof of
[54:58] something you don't see yet you know you
[55:00] have it that's what faith is
[55:02] faith is not I hope that's going to work
[55:04] that's you know I mean we have to have
[55:07] that kind of faith with the rapture I
[55:09] mean with the translation of this body
[55:11] it has to be revealed to you and I pray
[55:13] by the end of the service
[55:15] I mean God just anchors it in your soul
[55:17] I mean I'm going I'm one of them that
[55:20] will not taste this I mean I'm one of
[55:22] those that these atoms are going to be
[55:23] changed you know when brother Brown was
[55:25] caught beyond the curtain of time he was
[55:27] there before he realised he was there he
[55:29] was in his new body before he realized
[55:31] he was in his new body he was there with
[55:33] the Saints before even recognize this is
[55:35] what's happened hallelujah so the
[55:38] rapture the change in the body is going
[55:39] to happen and then we'll realize what's
[55:41] happened glory to God I mean but if that
[55:45] life is in you I mean the Holy Ghost is
[55:47] in you the word is in you quickened I
[55:49] mean you have to go but it has to become
[55:52] because you know you look at the Apostle
[55:54] Paul I'm just going to wander for a bit
[55:56] you look at the Apostle Paul he made the
[55:58] Lord on the roads of Damascus nothing
[56:00] moved them
[56:00] he was gripped by that one encounter
[56:03] with the Lord Jesus Christ and his whole
[56:05] life was now governed by that one time
[56:08] Abraham will talk about Abraham later he
[56:11] met God I don't know you know you read
[56:13] the accounts of when God spoke to
[56:15] Abraham it doesn't take very long to
[56:17] read it through 25 years hallelujah
[56:21] 25 years waiting for Isaac and in that
[56:23] time great distress and things happen
[56:25] but he was signaling us of mind of heart
[56:28] amen
[56:29] nothing moved him right and here we are
[56:34] we have more than just a moment but it
[56:37] only takes a moment if you really meet
[56:40] God your whole life as I'm on this
[56:42] course come what may I'm gonna walk with
[56:45] him amen
[56:48] so now Pam speaks you know what is the
[56:52] Christian life the Christian life is
[56:55] more than just well coming to church you
[56:56] know what are we living for it's not
[56:58] just to come to church and have a nice
[57:00] time and wonderful friends wonderful
[57:02] fellowship now we're getting ready to go
[57:04] into eternity that's why I trust that's
[57:07] why you come to church this way you hear
[57:09] the word faith cometh by hearing and
[57:11] hearing the Word of God so if you want
[57:12] more faith hear the word hallelujah
[57:14] because it's transforming you know there
[57:17] is translation faith in this message
[57:19] there is rapturing faith contained in
[57:21] the word but it's going to be released
[57:23] it's got to put on flesh I believe it
[57:26] myself
[57:27] so now brother Brown speaks a lot about
[57:30] the unseen world okay
[57:34] our mind you're gonna have to help me
[57:36] cuz I can't drive amen
[57:40] yeah give me that thing now he speaks
[57:44] about the unseen world a lot and to many
[57:47] of us it's a mystery
[57:50] amen it's a mystery you know I don't
[57:54] have a picture but you go look at the
[57:56] spectrum of light we only see a very
[57:59] small part of it the visible spectrum of
[58:01] light is very small compared to the
[58:03] whole spectrum and that just shows what
[58:06] our sense is actually contacted this
[58:08] natural world is very limited there's a
[58:10] lot more to this world than what you're
[58:11] seeing there's a lot more to this world
[58:13] than what you can imagine I mean but God
[58:16] sent Malachi for in this day to show us
[58:19] heavens real it's not someone's figment
[58:22] of someone's imagination God put a
[58:24] vessel upon the earth to reveal to you
[58:26] what's in the scriptures not just man's
[58:28] idea that's a reality
[58:30] I mean heavens more real than you this
[58:32] body you're in heavens more real than
[58:34] the body you're in
[58:35] it's more real than the clothes on your
[58:37] back it's more real than the food you
[58:39] eat that's amore yeah it's more real
[58:41] than you can imagine and we are being
[58:43] prepared to leave this world to go into
[58:45] glory hallelujah but it's got to be
[58:48] quickened you know I trust you don't
[58:50] come to church just because you like the
[58:52] people amen
[58:54] I trust you don't just come and follow
[58:56] the message because it agrees with maybe
[58:58] your standards but I trust that you
[59:00] follow this message
[59:02] because you've heard a voice from heaven
[59:03] and has spoken to your soul and
[59:05] something and you said yes Lord I follow
[59:08] you I mean I'm walking with this word I
[59:10] trust that's why you believe why do you
[59:13] got to really ask yourself sometimes why
[59:15] do I believe this isn't because I was
[59:17] raised this way I trust that's not the
[59:19] reason though that's a good start but
[59:21] you can come from anywhere doesn't
[59:23] matter we start it's where you finish I
[59:25] mean so it doesn't matter you could have
[59:27] the best parents in the world you've got
[59:29] to meet God you want to have that one
[59:31] time experience where you know he spoke
[59:33] to me I spoke to him I laid my life down
[59:36] I'm no longer the same my sins have been
[59:38] washed away I know they've been washed
[59:40] away
[59:41] Paulo you've got to meet him if Abraham
[59:44] could meet him Noah could meet him Isaac
[59:46] could meet him Moses met at my light you
[59:48] met him the apostles met him he's still
[59:50] the same God today he hasn't changed
[59:52] I mean Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[59:54] today and forever that means if they
[59:56] meet him in the New Testament we can
[59:58] meet him today
[59:59] hallelujah we're still living in Bible
[1:00:02] days he's the same God now he speaks
[1:00:07] about this and who's this Melchizedek he
[1:00:10] says he was the word a theophany is
[1:00:12] something you could not see that's the
[1:00:14] eternal body it couldn't it could be
[1:00:16] right here it could be right here now
[1:00:20] but you could not see it it's just like
[1:00:23] well like television that's in another
[1:00:25] dimension television people are moving
[1:00:27] right through this room now singing this
[1:00:30] colors also but the eye is only subject
[1:00:34] to the five senses your whole being is
[1:00:37] only subject the five senses rather so
[1:00:41] you know we know that these signals
[1:00:42] going through this room these signals
[1:00:45] going through this room these people
[1:00:47] moving through this room is voices Amen
[1:00:49] but we aren't built to pick up those
[1:00:52] voices we are built to pick up that
[1:00:55] video but it's going through the room
[1:00:57] Amen but if we were built to pick it up
[1:01:00] we could we could push a button
[1:01:02] basically and speak forth whatever the
[1:01:04] voices are saying Amen but I'm glad that
[1:01:07] we have a sense of faith we have a
[1:01:10] receiving tower I mean there's a there's
[1:01:13] a sending station in glory amen on the
[1:01:15] believer
[1:01:16] receiving station in their sole aim it's
[1:01:18] a word that's transmitted from heaven
[1:01:20] comes down and you receive it you can
[1:01:22] speak your forth hallelujah I mean but
[1:01:25] it's here amen but it's in another
[1:01:28] dimension that can that can be seen by
[1:01:31] transformation by television now
[1:01:33] television does not manufacture a
[1:01:35] picture a television only channels it
[1:01:38] into a circuit and in the television
[1:01:40] screen picks it up but the pictures
[1:01:42] there to begin with
[1:01:43] he says television was here when Adam
[1:01:46] was here
[1:01:47] television was here when Elijah said on
[1:01:49] Mount Carmel television was here when
[1:01:51] Jesus of Nazareth walked on the shores
[1:01:53] of Galilee but now they're only just
[1:01:55] discovering it right because the light
[1:01:58] travels you know you understand you know
[1:02:00] so it's there but now we've got the
[1:02:02] device to pick up what the camera is
[1:02:04] looking at now we're only just
[1:02:09] discovering it they wouldn't have
[1:02:10] believed it back there you would have
[1:02:13] been crazy to have said something like
[1:02:14] that but now it's become a reality and
[1:02:16] so it is that Christ is here hallelujah
[1:02:21] now I wanna I was I was kind of
[1:02:28] wrestling I find slideshows hard because
[1:02:31] I don't know where to start and end but
[1:02:34] just being with me but this is where I
[1:02:36] want to go heaven is more you know we
[1:02:40] you know we were you know we sang the
[1:02:42] song just reach out and touch him you'll
[1:02:45] never be the same but sometimes we've
[1:02:47] got to turn around say what what touched
[1:02:49] me what touched me when I heard that
[1:02:51] song and something quickened my soul
[1:02:53] what touched me when I heard that word
[1:02:55] what touched me when I heard the message
[1:02:57] what touched me when I read the
[1:02:59] scripture what what impacted me it's
[1:03:01] more than just words or more than just
[1:03:04] ink on paper or more than nice singing
[1:03:06] it goes beyond that the eternal he uses
[1:03:09] that as a channel Amen to get a hold of
[1:03:12] you and you're going to really just
[1:03:13] think what touched me maybe where my
[1:03:16] friends went another way and I went this
[1:03:18] way well what touch me to go this way I
[1:03:20] remember it being a university I was
[1:03:22] walking with my friends one day but then
[1:03:25] God something touched me and something
[1:03:27] said no I'm going to follow the Lord
[1:03:29] a Christian now it's not up to me who
[1:03:31] goes which way but something touched me
[1:03:33] something impacted me and you gotta ask
[1:03:35] the question well was it just peer
[1:03:37] pressure no in my case there was no
[1:03:39] Pierce to pressure me that pressured me
[1:03:41] the other way but something touched me
[1:03:43] saying no I'm going to follow this word
[1:03:44] I'm gonna follow the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:46] what touched me Jesus touched me
[1:03:49] and he has a purpose in doing it this
[1:03:53] just can we blank that oh no we just
[1:03:55] leave it up
[1:03:56] but here to prove it we're not here just
[1:03:57] to haphazardly be here we have a purpose
[1:04:00] well oldest to the youngest we have a
[1:04:02] purpose in this place now you've got
[1:04:06] five senses taste feel smell and hear
[1:04:13] but what if you didn't have sight you
[1:04:16] just had taste feel smelling here not
[1:04:19] see and somebody received this side and
[1:04:22] see it there's another world the Sun
[1:04:23] then feelings you bump into things and
[1:04:26] what and what it is and what it is can
[1:04:31] tell you what it is why you think the
[1:04:33] person was crazy because you didn't have
[1:04:35] that sense of sight nobody had ever seen
[1:04:38] it you know two of you would have heard
[1:04:40] of people had said such things as that
[1:04:42] but you doubted it but you know by the
[1:04:44] sense that it's real it's a real place
[1:04:46] see it's a place where you can see your
[1:04:49] sense declares that now the only thing
[1:04:53] you do when you die you just change
[1:04:55] those five senses glory should you just
[1:04:58] receive another sense and you're alive
[1:05:01] with the highest since thousands of
[1:05:02] times higher than this in another life a
[1:05:05] life where there's no death is no sorrow
[1:05:07] and the things that you don't know
[1:05:09] nothing about now you see it plainly
[1:05:11] when you cross there you don't
[1:05:13] understand it now because you're bumping
[1:05:15] into it you've got you haven't got that
[1:05:18] sense you say well I feel a strange
[1:05:20] feeling here tonight looks to me like
[1:05:22] this I just want to cry or shout or
[1:05:24] something
[1:05:24] it's the angels of the Lord so you're
[1:05:27] saying there's something that you just
[1:05:28] keep bumping into how lujah something's
[1:05:31] bumping into you you say well what is
[1:05:33] that what makes me feel this way what's
[1:05:35] what's causing these people you know I
[1:05:37] was singing of the convention and and
[1:05:38] also the youth camp before that and you
[1:05:41] see God just come down
[1:05:42] and people who are quietly no longer
[1:05:44] quiet and people who are reserved they
[1:05:46] know like yeah they're unreserved and
[1:05:48] people are screaming and shouting and I
[1:05:50] didn't believe it was because you know I
[1:05:52] you know I sit there the first service
[1:05:54] are sitting in the back right and our

[1:05:57] dominating the front and second row I
[1:05:59] said there's my there's my boys and my
[1:06:01] girls hallelujah tearing the place up
[1:06:03] and I saw the look on their face when
[1:06:05] they got to their bare feet that was
[1:06:08] saying amen because it was personal to
[1:06:10] them they weren't doing it because of
[1:06:11] other people they didn't care there is a
[1:06:13] determination yes this is this is for me
[1:06:16] this word is mine and they may know they
[1:06:18] lay claim on it
[1:06:20] hallelujah they weren't doing it because
[1:06:21] the others were doing and they're doing
[1:06:22] it for themselves what bumped into you
[1:06:25] hallelujah

[1:06:29] bumping into you make you do those
[1:06:31] things

[1:06:34] more than excitement it's more than
[1:06:36] emotion but eternity is bumping into you

[1:06:41] attention

[1:06:50] takes you out of the zone hallelujah cuz
[1:06:52] they get bump speeds up because we're
[1:06:54] speeding up it's slowing down eternity
[1:06:57] and time is merging together

[1:07:01] then a bumps here and there bumps you
[1:07:03] there eventually it grips you Paulo yeah
[1:07:05] and then these atoms of change and
[1:07:07] you're gone hallelujah that's the time
[1:07:10] we're living in why do you think the
[1:07:13] services were so intense the gods and

[1:07:38] September 2007 oh if that's 11 years
[1:07:40] well maybe my maths good whatever that's
[1:07:43] just a that's like a picosecond and
[1:07:46] God's timing God's been waiting seven
[1:07:49] however many thousand years and I don't
[1:07:51] know how many I don't know well he was
[1:07:53] eternally didn't have time but I don't
[1:07:54] know how long he just him in a store
[1:07:56] and his attributes and he's thinking of
[1:07:58] you and thinking how you're going to be
[1:08:00] and thinking of the age you're going to
[1:08:01] be I mean when he meets you in the and
[1:08:03] the and the time you're going to be upon
[1:08:05] the earth and your parents and your
[1:08:06] grandparents or your grandpa your
[1:08:08] holidays been thinking about your color
[1:08:10] here and how he's going to make you and
[1:08:11] you know and then finally hallelujah
[1:08:14] just like any great artist you think an
[1:08:15] artist would be excited that exactly
[1:08:17] what was in their mind just like a great
[1:08:19] painter exactly what's in their mind is
[1:08:21] now on the canvas
[1:08:22] hallelujah then they can rejoice because
[1:08:24] what was their inspiration I mean is now
[1:08:27] made material Paulo is the same thing
[1:08:29] with the Bride of Christ the inspiration
[1:08:31] was that God's mind it's now put on
[1:08:33] flesh hallelujah I think he's very
[1:08:36] excited
[1:08:37] I've been waiting 11 years he's been
[1:08:39] waiting I don't know how long you think
[1:08:41] you'll be excited around the throne he's
[1:08:43] gonna rejoice he's gonna be happy
[1:08:46] here's my bride here's my love here's my
[1:08:48] apple of my eye here's the one I
[1:08:49] delighted here's the one I see no sin
[1:08:51] and I see her faultless I see her
[1:08:53] perfect Holly I see her made in my image
[1:08:56] hallelujah you know God thinks very very
[1:08:59] very very very very highly of you
[1:09:03] remember God doesn't if God thought of
[1:09:06] you a certain way that's how you're
[1:09:07] gonna be you can't help it
[1:09:09] so if God thought of you made in the
[1:09:11] image of his word that's it I just quit
[1:09:14] and give up saying Lord mold me and
[1:09:15] shake me amen
[1:09:18] so that's this thing bumping into you
[1:09:19] it's the angels of the Lord see they'll
[1:09:22] go to a next one
[1:09:23] could you imagine a person that never
[1:09:26] had the sense of sight never did see and
[1:09:29] you bump against objects you would have
[1:09:32] to drive your food from your food from
[1:09:35] energy or from some other source but
[1:09:38] would bump into something you had a
[1:09:41] sense of feeling but not sight and then
[1:09:44] all that once somebody opened their eyes
[1:09:46] up and see in a completely different
[1:09:48] world they'd never seen anything and if
[1:09:52] then you would say well now what should
[1:09:55] feel warm on you that is the Sun what's
[1:10:00] the Sun it's a light what is light see
[1:10:03] he never lived in that sense he doesn't
[1:10:05] know what it is that you bump against
[1:10:07] it's a certain certain thing well what's
[1:10:10] that
[1:10:10] see he never lived in that dimension at
[1:10:13] all it would be very strange to him to
[1:10:16] know it well now if God lets us love and
[1:10:21] we are bodily here in five senses but
[1:10:24] there is another sense and then when we
[1:10:26] wake up into that sense and that is the
[1:10:29] sense of vision and we see that that
[1:10:32] thing but me and what it is and it makes
[1:10:34] us feel these things that we do and try
[1:10:38] to tell someone about it just like
[1:10:40] telling a man that never did see in his
[1:10:42] life he wouldn't understand it because
[1:10:44] he'd never acquainted with that sense
[1:10:46] and that's the way it is in the gospel
[1:10:47] they didn't understand it it's hard to
[1:10:50] get them to see it because they never
[1:10:52] lived in there they know nothing about
[1:10:55] it they feel it and they can have a
[1:10:57] reaction to it but to actually know what
[1:11:01] it is we don't so when you can see
[1:11:04] beyond that curtain of time and here's a
[1:11:07] prophet that went beyond the curtain a
[1:11:09] time when you can see beyond that
[1:11:11] curtain of time where that comes from
[1:11:13] and then trying to come back and tell
[1:11:16] the people that's only felt it with the
[1:11:17] sense of feeling like they never have to
[1:11:20] be able to see it it's hard to tell a
[1:11:22] man but you just have to do the best you
[1:11:25] can till we all see face to face so here
[1:11:29] he is he says we are feeling you
[1:11:32] understand what he's saying he said so
[1:11:34] when you can see beyond the curtain of
[1:11:36] time where that comes from this thing
[1:11:39] that's bumping into you hallelujah
[1:11:41] the Eternity is bumping into you that's
[1:11:45] that same that's beyond the curtain of
[1:11:47] time that paradise no sickness no death
[1:11:51] no pain no sorrow no devil no bad
[1:11:55] thoughts holy and none of those frailty
[1:11:57] of our human bodies just perfection
[1:11:59] beyond perfection beyond perfection
[1:12:01] brother Bram says sublime will never
[1:12:03] touch it I mean that's what's bumping
[1:12:04] into you hallelujah
[1:12:07] that is what's bumping into you
[1:12:09] hallelujah amen I'm glad and he said
[1:12:14] certainly he lives what's this you're
[1:12:17] bumping into all the time what's that
[1:12:20] condemn you when you're wrong that's
[1:12:21] what what's that that makes you belief
[1:12:25] hallelujah that eternal land makes you
[1:12:29] believe hallelujah heaven makes you
[1:12:31] believe I was rejoicing when I read this
[1:12:35] amen what's this thing that grips you
[1:12:37] that land hallelujah
[1:12:40] we're citizens of another land Amen see
[1:12:43] that's him you might not be able to open
[1:12:46] your eyes and see him because he's in
[1:12:47] spirit form the invisible God but he
[1:12:50] dwells among a visible people making
[1:12:52] himself visible by his promised word in
[1:12:54] that people holy what does the promised
[1:12:57] word of the our body change I mean the
[1:13:00] translation of the dead and the living
[1:13:02] hallelujah a bride coming to her
[1:13:04] position I mean see you see an invisible
[1:13:07] God becomes visible because he manifests
[1:13:09] as promised Word and that people
[1:13:11] Alleluia do you understand it now it
[1:13:13] says here before we call the prayer line
[1:13:15] I trust God will do this I mean so he
[1:13:18] talks about see us I was trying to I
[1:13:21] don't know I was saying Lord how can I
[1:13:23] put this into words because here god
[1:13:26] that's great eternal one where we come
[1:13:30] from we come from a where as attributes
[1:13:32] who come down upon the earth and we're
[1:13:35] born here in a spiritual amnesia we
[1:13:37] don't know we're from him but then in
[1:13:39] God's timing he finds you he calls you
[1:13:43] eternity bumps into you hallelujah and
[1:13:46] then you begin to wonder what's bumping
[1:13:48] into me what's what's what's affecting
[1:13:50] my life what's gripping my heart
[1:13:53] hallelujah and then you began to realize
[1:13:56] that's your father that's you Lord
[1:13:58] that's you getting my attention that's
[1:14:01] your gripping me hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:04] and what is it now
[1:14:06] so because often we think Lord if we
[1:14:08] could just look beyond the curtain of
[1:14:09] time but they same atmosphere that was
[1:14:11] there comes down upon the earth
[1:14:13] hallelujah and that's how we have thee
[1:14:16] it's the evidence of things unseen
[1:14:18] hallelujah it's the evidence of a new
[1:14:21] body
[1:14:21] how Lewis the evidence of the rapture
[1:14:24] Amen now faith is the substance of
[1:14:31] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:14:33] not seen
[1:14:33] so the word of not hopeful it means to
[1:14:38] anticipate usually with pleasure it's an
[1:14:40] expectation abstract or concrete or
[1:14:44] confidence it's faith or hope so it's a
[1:14:47] it's something that you're under
[1:14:49] expectation usually with pleasure this
[1:14:53] message gives us rapturing faith I mean
[1:14:56] it gives us faith to change the body
[1:14:59] hallelujah many times we said well how
[1:15:01] can we have rapturing faith the word
[1:15:03] when the word comes open it releases the
[1:15:06] power okay in the days of Moses in the
[1:15:10] days of Moses they were slaves God came
[1:15:12] down on Mount Sinai he opened his word
[1:15:14] remember the law was always part of him
[1:15:16] he was always the lawgiver and he is the
[1:15:18] word right so he came down he revealed
[1:15:21] that part of himself to Israel those
[1:15:24] that received that word and faith took
[1:15:26] their mountain Caleb and Joshua received
[1:15:28] it in faith they said let's go take our
[1:15:30] mountain Caleb got his mountain
[1:15:32] he says I'm as I'm as strong then as I
[1:15:35] am now I'm 84 years old now buddy says
[1:15:37] give me my mountain and he went and got
[1:15:39] his mountain why because the word when
[1:15:41] the word came open and he received it in
[1:15:44] faith that released a power to manifest
[1:15:46] the promise of the word what was the
[1:15:48] promise of the law that they would dwell
[1:15:49] in the promised land they would drive
[1:15:51] out their inhabitants if I wouldn't be
[1:15:53] under there his vineyard or fig tree
[1:15:54] whatever you know they would dwell in
[1:15:56] their land a POW was released
[1:15:58] I mean sham guy recognized that he was a
[1:16:01] circumcised son of Abraham and he got
[1:16:05] his ox God jumped out the window and or
[1:16:08] whatever killed six hundred Philistines
[1:16:09] why because the wood came open to him he
[1:16:12] recognized who he is
[1:16:14] amen and you can go all the way down
[1:16:16] through the scripture Jesus comes amen
[1:16:18] here he was the lawgiver Mount Sinai now
[1:16:21] it's time for grace your furtherance of
[1:16:23] the word he reveals himself Amen
[1:16:25] releases the Holy Ghost upon the people
[1:16:27] now people have passed and live above
[1:16:29] sin I mean in the Old Testament there's
[1:16:32] a blood of bulls and goats but they
[1:16:33] couldn't live above sin but under the
[1:16:35] blood of Jesus Christ now we can live
[1:16:37] above sin why because the word came open
[1:16:38] it released a power amen to the people
[1:16:41] could manifest the word hallelujah and
[1:16:44] now here we are in the day when the
[1:16:45] seven thunders have been added I mean
[1:16:47] they no longer thunders their voices
[1:16:49] that spoken I mean the word has come
[1:16:51] but it has released a power and what is
[1:16:53] the purpose that power rapturing faith
[1:16:57] hallelujah that's the purpose of it
[1:17:00] let's not just have doctrine and then to
[1:17:01] discuss and argue no God would release
[1:17:04] the power upon the earth to take you to
[1:17:06] heaven that we don't have to taste death
[1:17:09] hallelujah amen so now it's the evidence
[1:17:14] evidence is a proof of conviction it's
[1:17:17] an evidence or a reproof so faith is the
[1:17:21] substance of something that you're under
[1:17:23] expectation for and it's the proof of
[1:17:26] that what you don't see amen
[1:17:29] that's why we need rapturing faith
[1:17:31] that's why we need a revelation and I'm
[1:17:34] going to go on to it faith as a
[1:17:35] revelation so it has to be revealed to
[1:17:37] you I'm going
[1:17:39] Allu you I'm going now we're living at a
[1:17:49] time faith brother Brahim season and he
[1:17:52] cares do you care
[1:17:54] faith is not a hope so or could be right
[1:17:57] it's got to be absolutely amen it's your
[1:17:59] ultimate it's your absolute that's the
[1:18:01] thing that you're tied to you have come
[1:18:03] to your ultimate that it is the truth
[1:18:05] and there is nothing and it's nothing
[1:18:07] but the truth and it must be dust and
[1:18:10] then when you realize that in your mind
[1:18:12] then you've got to approach it with your
[1:18:15] whole life soul body all that's in you
[1:18:17] just completely sellout everything to it
[1:18:20] as Jesus so graciously taught us and the
[1:18:23] man buying pearls and he found the one
[1:18:25] of great price he sold all the others to
[1:18:27] get it all the truths and everything
[1:18:29] that he had though they were good pearls
[1:18:31] this one mean all to him and when you
[1:18:34] find God's ultimate his word
[1:18:36] I promise upon a certain thing you must
[1:18:38] know first that it is God's Word that
[1:18:41] the thing that you're seeing being done
[1:18:43] is God there's no maybe so it could be
[1:18:46] or it looks like it might be it is God
[1:18:49] then when you get to that spot then
[1:18:51] that's the pearl of great price you must
[1:18:54] get away from anything or that anybody
[1:18:56] else tells you contrary to it you must
[1:18:59] not look to what man has achieved you
[1:19:01] must look to what God has said and what
[1:19:03] he's promised
[1:19:05] and see him to do it and that's your
[1:19:07] ultimate right there
[1:19:10] hallelujah you know I was I was reading
[1:19:14] we just go see quite a little bit I'm
[1:19:16] reading a book by a historian and he so
[1:19:19] and it's called all things are possible
[1:19:22] and he looked covers the healing and
[1:19:24] charismatic revival and he's not a
[1:19:25] charismatic or Pentecostal but he just
[1:19:27] did a he stood a historical account of
[1:19:30] the whole thing and he attributes
[1:19:32] brother Branham as the initiator and all
[1:19:35] Roberts they're the two giants for
[1:19:36] brother brands minister ministry in this
[1:19:38] shaded the healing revival and he
[1:19:40] mentions in this book is there's about
[1:19:41] two hundred at least healing ministries
[1:19:45] were going around the United States at
[1:19:48] that time from 48 to 58 so it was a
[1:19:52] massive big yo the whole country was
[1:19:54] gripped by healing revival God was
[1:19:57] pouring out a spirit now and everyone
[1:20:00] was under expectation the Lord's coming
[1:20:03] the Lord is coming they were uh next
[1:20:05] week the Lord is coming but the
[1:20:07] scripture says in an hour or a day that
[1:20:09] you do not look for him he'll come right
[1:20:11] but then that but then I was also
[1:20:13] thinking so so now the whole whole world
[1:20:16] you know the Christian world was gripped
[1:20:18] because it wasn't just America it was
[1:20:19] South America Europe
[1:20:20] God was is pouring out his spirit and so
[1:20:23] now people were under such an
[1:20:25] expectation the Lord's going to return
[1:20:27] right now but then I went into the
[1:20:29] healing lines of brother Branham and I
[1:20:32] did a bit of a search and not one person
[1:20:35] that stood before him not one person
[1:20:39] standing there and the Lord discerns
[1:20:41] what's wrong or what they need is not
[1:20:43] one the Lord said you want to see the
[1:20:45] resurrection you want to see the change
[1:20:48] in the body you want to see the rapture
[1:20:50] I couldn't find one I couldn't find one
[1:20:55] they get the whole world was gripped by
[1:20:57] this the Lord is coming now I trust that
[1:21:02] really you to think about it we have all
[1:21:06] have burdens we all have needs right
[1:21:09] we'll have questions we'll have things
[1:21:12] but when it comes down to the core of it
[1:21:15] if you would stand before the
[1:21:18] prophet and the Lord was there and he
[1:21:21] discerned what you really want
[1:21:23] I trust it would be I what you want to
[1:21:26] see a body change you want to be taken
[1:21:29] you want to see the rapture not just for
[1:21:32] you but for your family I mean I trust I
[1:21:35] trust that would be on your you know the
[1:21:37] depths of your soul this is the main
[1:21:39] thing I want to see I want to see this
[1:21:41] I wanna before I realize this change I
[1:21:43] want to I want it to be changed I want
[1:21:46] to see the dead in Christ rise we're
[1:21:48] here as a people that are called that we
[1:21:51] won't see death
[1:21:52] that the cycle of death life and death
[1:21:55] will be broken that there will be a
[1:21:57] people that will not taste it but
[1:22:00] they'll be gone and I trust that there's
[1:22:03] something in your soul saying that's me
[1:22:05] hallelujah
[1:22:07] I wish I had were I wish I had
[1:22:08] educational words to put it to you I
[1:22:10] mean but I trusted something and you
[1:22:12] saying that's me that's why he called me
[1:22:15] that's why I'm a believer I mean not
[1:22:18] because of doctrine or something else
[1:22:20] not even because of discernment or a
[1:22:23] supernatural ministry but his word he
[1:22:25] called me and he's made itself known to
[1:22:28] me you're gonna walk like Enoch what he
[1:22:34] knock had a testimony that he pleased
[1:22:36] God and we'll come into that but he
[1:22:38] walked individual walk it wasn't him and
[1:22:40] his family you know in John 6 the whole
[1:22:43] multitude left there's no individual
[1:22:45] walk there but he not walked with God
[1:22:47] and he walked and he walked and he
[1:22:50] walked and then one day his faith I saw
[1:22:55] drop it to you right now we read there
[1:22:57] by faith Enoch was translated now you
[1:23:01] just take it to another way I said his
[1:23:03] faith took him in a rapture his
[1:23:05] revelation took him in a rapture I meant

[1:24:56] write thanks to my wife in a way that
[1:24:58] she'll know what I'm saying
[1:24:59] and you won't know you will not know
[1:25:03] what I'm saying yeah and you could
[1:25:04] debate and write theses and whatever and
[1:25:07] set up schools of thought but you
[1:25:09] wouldn't know what I'm saying she would
[1:25:11] know because we're in a love
[1:25:13] relationship we are united one heart one
[1:25:15] mind one soul hallelujah and it's the
[1:25:18] same thing with this Bible
[1:25:20] I mean God has written it in a certain
[1:25:22] way I mean that his wife will understand
[1:25:25] hallelujah Jesus said you know he
[1:25:29] rejoiced these things are hidden from
[1:25:31] the eyes of the wise and prudent reveal
[1:25:33] to babes
[1:25:35] amen so it should be Lord
[1:25:39] reveal yourself to me don't hide
[1:25:42] yourself away I'm not just satisfied
[1:25:45] with just being saved hallelujah Lord I
[1:25:48] want the depths of you you know the
[1:25:50] Bible says yo since what eyes not seen
[1:25:52] here has not heard the Oh nor is the
[1:25:54] incident of the heart of man those
[1:25:55] things that God has prepared but the
[1:25:57] Spirit searches out the deeper things of
[1:25:59] God hallelujah so there should be a cry
[1:26:03] there should be a yearning this world is
[1:26:06] against that kind of thing but there
[1:26:08] should be a hunger or thirst Lord reveal
[1:26:11] yourself to me don't hide yourself away
[1:26:14] hallelujah we should pray for revelation
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:19] don't ever ever let it become a common
[1:26:21] thing amen I want all that he is
[1:26:25] I want all that he is hallelujah
[1:26:28] that's how we should be romans 4 for the
[1:26:33] promise that he should be heir of the
[1:26:38] world was not to abraham or to his seed
[1:26:42] through the law but through the
[1:26:46] righteousness of faith for a favor of
[1:26:48] the law he is faith is made void and the
[1:26:52] promise of none effect now remember we
[1:26:54] read that Enoch had this testimony that
[1:26:57] he pleased God okay so this is where I'm
[1:27:00] going okay because we'll see this now
[1:27:03] and the promise made of none effect
[1:27:04] because the law worketh wrath for where
[1:27:08] no law is there is no transgression
[1:27:11] therefore it is of faith that it might
[1:27:14] be by grace to the end the promise might
[1:27:18] be sure to all the seed not to that only
[1:27:21] which is of the law but do that which is
[1:27:24] of faith of Abraham who is the father of
[1:27:27] us all as is written I have made thee a
[1:27:29] father of many nations but before he
[1:27:32] before him whom he believed even God who
[1:27:35] quickened the dead and called those
[1:27:38] things which be not as though they were
[1:27:41] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:27:45] he might become the father of many
[1:27:47] nations according as that it was spoken
[1:27:50] so shall thy seed be and
[1:27:53] being not weak in faith he considered
[1:27:55] not his own body now did when he was
[1:27:58] upon me about a hundred years old
[1:27:59] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:28:01] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:28:04] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:28:06] giving glory to God and being fully
[1:28:10] persuaded that what he had promised he
[1:28:13] was able also to perform and therefore
[1:28:16] it was imputed to him for righteousness
[1:28:18] now it was not written for his sake
[1:28:21] alone that it was imputed to him but for
[1:28:24] us also to whom it shall be imputed if
[1:28:27] we believe on Him that raised up Jesus
[1:28:28] our Lord from the dead who was delivered
[1:28:31] for our offenses and was raised up again
[1:28:34] for our justification
[1:28:36] so his faith was imputed to him for
[1:28:39] righteousness
[1:28:39] because he believed the promise of his
[1:28:42] day it was imputed to him that he is
[1:28:44] righteous I mean not that he did
[1:28:46] anything but because he believed God's
[1:28:48] Word for his hour it was imputed you are
[1:28:51] righteous Abraham hallelujah
[1:28:53] and so now God is saying it wasn't just
[1:28:55] imputed to him but it's computed to all
[1:28:58] those that belief hallelujah so now how
[1:29:02] can we have a testimony that we please
[1:29:03] God we believe him I mean Jesus was
[1:29:06] asked by the scribes and Pharisees how
[1:29:08] can we do the works of God and Jesus
[1:29:11] said believe on Him whom he has sent
[1:29:13] leave on the word that has come
[1:29:16] hallelujah so now your faith imputes
[1:29:20] righteousness to you hallelujah why is
[1:29:25] it wasn't quite my faith hallelujah has
[1:29:30] mp/h righteousness to me I mean so
[1:29:34] therefore if I believe his word I have a
[1:29:37] testimony that I please God how do you
[1:29:40] please God you have no sin I mean you
[1:29:43] have no nothing held against you that's
[1:29:45] how you have a testimony that you please
[1:29:47] God hallelujah
[1:29:48] so if righteousness is imputed to you I
[1:29:50] mean your sin doesn't come and do any
[1:29:53] consideration God said you know David
[1:29:55] said that blessed is the man that God
[1:29:57] does not impute sin I mean how can he
[1:29:59] impute righteousness and send to the
[1:30:01] same person he cannot do it he cannot
[1:30:03] impute sin and righteous to the same
[1:30:04] person it's either one or the
[1:30:06] hallelujah so therefore a man if you
[1:30:09] believe the word a man you really
[1:30:11] believe it not just in here it's
[1:30:13] anchored down into your soul
[1:30:14] I mean what's happened you believe that
[1:30:16] word then God imputes righteousness to
[1:30:18] you
[1:30:18] hallelujah amen I think all condemnation
[1:30:22] self condemnation should just fly away
[1:30:25] hallelujah just just tell the devil to
[1:30:28] shut up and quit and go I mean tell him
[1:30:31] to stop talking
[1:30:32] say sorry God has revealed his word to
[1:30:34] me I mean God is quick in his word to my
[1:30:36] soul I believe it therefore I'm
[1:30:39] righteous amen we know faith goes into
[1:30:43] action but I just wonder you think the
[1:30:45] core of it that's fight sin is not
[1:30:47] imputed to the bride because she
[1:30:50] believes her husband
[1:30:51] hallelujah she believes the word now
[1:30:54] Abraham knew that Isaac was coming
[1:30:57] hallelujah
[1:30:59] Abraham knew Isaac was coming 25 years
[1:31:02] he knew he was coming however long he
[1:31:05] kept the promise before him it wasn't a
[1:31:07] hope so physically it was impossible
[1:31:10] they couldn't do it
[1:31:12] how lujah but it was anchored in a soul
[1:31:15] I'm gonna have a son I'm gonna have a
[1:31:17] son with Sarah amen and he kept the
[1:31:20] promise in front of him it didn't get
[1:31:21] common how you feeling this months here
[1:31:24] same month number two how you feeling
[1:31:28] the same glory to God we're gonna have
[1:31:31] the son I'm the father of many nations
[1:31:34] hallelujah it was revealed to him see
[1:31:36] when things reveal to you anything
[1:31:38] country just flutters away because God
[1:31:42] has revealed it to you all the wrestling
[1:31:44] goes away because you know if God has
[1:31:46] said thus hallelujah hallelujah amen if
[1:31:51] God has said thus amen then we can just
[1:31:53] rest in that and so however many years
[1:31:57] later how you feelin Sarah she may have
[1:31:59] got a bit annoyed but Abraham wasn't
[1:32:01] getting annoyed how low he's on his way
[1:32:03] and many people think that that old man
[1:32:05] has lost his marbles Nora he found his
[1:32:07] marbles because God told him it's going
[1:32:09] to happen
[1:32:10] hallelujah and it should be the same
[1:32:12] with us keep the promise keep the
[1:32:16] promise before you widen Abraham and
[1:32:18] Sarah go down to Sodom
[1:32:20] why do they stay up where they were in
[1:32:22] the harder land because they're
[1:32:24] expecting a visitation their whole life
[1:32:27] was governed was actually governed by
[1:32:29] that amen and it should be the same
[1:32:32] thing with you and I why do you live the
[1:32:34] life you're gonna why are you this way
[1:32:37] God gave me a promise I'm what's that
[1:32:41] promise you won't find me one day if you
[1:32:45] want to find me repent and be born again
[1:32:47] and be baptized name of Lord Jesus
[1:32:48] Christ and you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:32:50] then you'll come with right amen people
[1:32:56] think you're made well this world is
[1:32:58] made aliyah but the promise did not get
[1:33:03] old to him it was a reality now we have
[1:33:07] the story here of simon simeon or simon
[1:33:10] have you say well there you go
[1:33:12] he was in the temple he's an old man and
[1:33:14] behold there was a man in Jerusalem
[1:33:15] whose name was Simeon Simon and the same
[1:33:18] man was just and devout waiting for the
[1:33:20] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[1:33:23] was upon him and it was revealed unto
[1:33:24] him by the Holy Ghost that he should not
[1:33:26] see death before he had seen the Lord's
[1:33:29] Christ now in that day everyone was
[1:33:33] looking for a messiah they're under
[1:33:35] expectation the Romans they're under
[1:33:37] Roman control they were and and they're
[1:33:40] expecting some great leader to come and
[1:33:43] deliver them from the Romans reestablish
[1:33:45] the kingdom so it wasn't only this man
[1:33:47] that was looking the whole the whole
[1:33:50] country was under some kind of
[1:33:52] expectation but the difference with this
[1:33:54] man and the rest of everyone as it was
[1:33:56] revealed to him it was revealed to him
[1:33:59] that he would not taste death until he
[1:34:01] sees the Lord's Messiah the Lord's
[1:34:03] Christ how do you think he would have
[1:34:05] been how do you think he's old already
[1:34:07] can't be very long hallelujah what's
[1:34:11] happened to you God spoke to me are you
[1:34:14] sure no no God spoke to me What did he
[1:34:16] say I'm not gonna die - I see the Lord's
[1:34:19] Christ oh yes sure we've been waiting
[1:34:21] 400 odd years or you know that's from
[1:34:23] Malachi till then and then Isaiah was
[1:34:25] what 800 years I know you know the
[1:34:28] timeframe there's some homework go look
[1:34:29] it up you know they've been looking for
[1:34:31] this to come for centuries and you
[1:34:33] you gonna see it him yeah why cuz God
[1:34:37] told me prove it I can't I can't I have
[1:34:41] no evidence but I believe it
[1:34:43] hallelujah Here I am waiting but you're
[1:34:47] gonna die that means that's very soon
[1:34:48] yeah hallelujah glory and the thing is
[1:34:54] he did the thing is he did he saw the
[1:34:56] Lord's Christ and in what was revealed
[1:34:58] to him happened he was led right to the
[1:35:01] baby and the temple hallelujah glory now
[1:35:09] Daniels sitting in in Babylon and he
[1:35:12] begins to read the Book of Jeremiah and
[1:35:14] he realizes that it's just 2 years
[1:35:17] during my prophesied that Israel would
[1:35:19] be 70 years in Babylon then they'll come
[1:35:22] back that's now year 68 two years till
[1:35:26] their promises fulfilled and here
[1:35:28] Daniel's reading The Book of Jeremiah
[1:35:30] now notice him when he read this he
[1:35:36] began to sit his face unto the Lord God
[1:35:38] and seek my parents supplications with
[1:35:40] fasting and sackcloth and ashes he began
[1:35:43] to seek the Lord when he read this now I
[1:35:46] don't believe Jeremiah was the only one
[1:35:48] with the copy of Jeremiah's writings it
[1:35:50] would have been others others would have
[1:35:52] read it amen
[1:35:54] but what happened to Daniel was
[1:35:56] different I mean he was reading the
[1:36:00] prophecy and something gripped him
[1:36:02] saying it soon
[1:36:04] something gripped us all this is going
[1:36:06] to happen and it's going to happen while
[1:36:08] I'm still alive
[1:36:10] and then he began to seek the Lord
[1:36:11] earnestly Lord when is it going to
[1:36:13] happen Lord you have opened your word
[1:36:15] see when the Lord opens is word to you
[1:36:17] when he quickens that said Lord wins
[1:36:19] it's going to be Amen Lord when's this
[1:36:21] going to happen there's a reason why he
[1:36:22] reveals himself to you it's not just a
[1:36:25] tickle some religious such I mean but he
[1:36:27] wants you to realize that what he's
[1:36:28] doing in your hour ain't meant so now so
[1:36:31] so here is biggest a praise seek the
[1:36:33] Lord hallelujah what did it do is
[1:36:36] through Daniel into a state of
[1:36:37] desperation Lord when's this going to
[1:36:40] happen
[1:36:40] Lord when is my people going to return
[1:36:43] hallelujah well you say well what is
[1:36:46] this got to do with the
[1:36:47] revelation of the rapture amen because
[1:36:50] that you know the Bible says Jesus said
[1:36:51] that no man knows the day or the hour
[1:36:53] that is true amen
[1:36:56] but it you throw throw us into such a
[1:36:59] state we say Lord I want to be ready
[1:37:02] Lord I want my family to be ready I want
[1:37:05] my children to be ready hallelujah I
[1:37:08] want my church to be ready I want my
[1:37:10] friends to be ready
[1:37:11] I mean lord give me the revelation of
[1:37:13] the rapture I want all that you have and
[1:37:16] should grip us how they should consume
[1:37:19] us Amen Lord it could be now hallelujah
[1:37:24] what are we living for sure we have to
[1:37:27] have jobs and careers and houses and you
[1:37:30] know children all those things but what
[1:37:33] is the main thrust of our life the main
[1:37:36] thrust of our life should be we're
[1:37:37] getting ready to leave amen this is this
[1:37:41] is because Jesus died on Calvary not
[1:37:44] just our sins will be forgiven but he
[1:37:46] died with with the rapture in mind how
[1:37:50] lujah I've purchased their Redemption
[1:37:52] now I'm going to claim what I've
[1:37:53] purchased there's going to come a season
[1:37:55] where he claims and carries away
[1:37:56] hallelujah so I said Lord I want to see
[1:37:59] them the fullness of redemption
[1:38:01] manifested in me hallelujah the full
[1:38:05] extent why'd he die that sin would be
[1:38:07] defeated that death would come to an end
[1:38:09] that a people would not taste death amen
[1:38:13] hallelujah
[1:38:14] so he's been Lord when's it going to
[1:38:16] happen I want to be ready I trust a
[1:38:19] quick Excel something should grip you
[1:38:21] not just oh that's a nice thought or a
[1:38:23] nice idea but Lord gripped me bump into
[1:38:27] me holy you bump into me with this
[1:38:29] revelation
[1:38:30] I mean bump into me I said Lord that my
[1:38:32] whole life would be changed hallelujah
[1:38:36] Daniel was gripped and he prayed and
[1:38:39] fasted has to be revealed to us Matthew
[1:38:44] 16 Jesus asked asked his disciples who
[1:38:47] you who do men say that I am and they
[1:38:49] say you're Elias of Jeremiah Jeremiah
[1:38:52] John or one of the prophets
[1:38:54] but then he asks a question who do you
[1:38:55] say that I am and Simon Peter said thou
[1:38:58] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:39:01] now he's asked the question what's been
[1:39:02] revealed to them and then they give the
[1:39:05] answer while it's being revealed to them
[1:39:06] that you're one of the prophets but
[1:39:07] what's been revealed to you what's been
[1:39:10] revealed to you and it's the same thing
[1:39:11] with this message who do you say this is
[1:39:14] amen right even right in 2019 when I was
[1:39:18] at the when I was at the convention in
[1:39:19] Auckland
[1:39:20] I was rejoicing saying Lord you've
[1:39:22] changed the season you've changed the
[1:39:25] season we are not just it's not regular

[1:39:32] bringing a greater quickening coming
[1:39:34] down how many clarity's bumping bumping
[1:39:36] into people trying to get them ready
[1:39:37] trying to awaken them trying to open
[1:39:39] their eyes of understanding cuz it's
[1:39:41] going home time hallelujah that's going
[1:39:45] home time and that's why I was rejoicing
[1:39:48] there's a few moments I said Lord this
[1:39:50] could be it would have been good
[1:39:53] hallelujah but seriously it could be it
[1:39:56] yes

[1:40:00] people will be universal rapture we may
[1:40:03] be asleep we'll be taken we both may be
[1:40:05] awake depends day night wherever you
[1:40:08] know we're gonna be taken and you'll be
[1:40:11] taken before you realize it amen
[1:40:16] he says that what the crisis started
[1:40:18] living God as he blessed art thou simon
[1:40:21] barjona for flesh and blood has not
[1:40:24] revealed this unto thee but my father
[1:40:26] which is in heaven you didn't get this
[1:40:29] by just observation you didn't get this
[1:40:32] just by asking people what they thought

[1:40:36] father in heaven quicken it to your soul
[1:40:37] that's why you got this a me you an get

[1:40:43] message I mean you didn't give this just
[1:40:45] because someone told your testimony I
[1:40:46] mean you got this because God your
[1:40:48] Father in Heaven revealed it to you and
[1:40:50] then your father had him and open your
[1:40:52] eyes of understanding I mean that you
[1:40:53] would recognize you're part of the
[1:40:55] rapture I mean you'd recognize you're
[1:40:56] part of the living Saints are we
[1:40:58] translated I mean your Father in Heaven
[1:41:00] revealed to you it wasn't your
[1:41:02] observation it wasn't your mental your

[1:41:10] revealed it to me hallelujah amen
[1:41:14] and I say unto thee thou art Peter upon
[1:41:16] this rock I'll build my church that rock
[1:41:19] is the rock of Revelation and the gates
[1:41:21] of Hell shall not prevail against it I
[1:41:23] mean a gate as a defensive thing right
[1:41:26] it shuts an access point hallelujah
[1:41:29] those gates will not prevail bus bust
[1:41:32] through them in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:41:34] hallelujah see my prayer is see my
[1:41:37] heart's desire if it's daytime or
[1:41:40] nighttime I want to see my three girls
[1:41:43] become between eighteen and twenty one
[1:41:44] before my eyes see them become
[1:41:47] hallelujah into their glorified form I
[1:41:49] believe I'm going to see it you may
[1:41:51] think I'm crazy but I'm I'm under
[1:41:53] expectation I said Lord anchor into
[1:41:56] their souls hallelujah that they're not
[1:41:58] here just to be little girls they're
[1:41:59] here to take a rapture and then they're
[1:42:01] here to walk from this world to the next
[1:42:02] world hallelujah amen that's how it
[1:42:06] should be you say you've gone off the
[1:42:09] deep end I like swimming in deep water
[1:42:12] hallelujah I mean scuba diving is a lot
[1:42:16] more fun than just being in a paddling
[1:42:17] pool if you've ever been now behold I
[1:42:24] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:42:26] sleep now this is like okay so Daniel
[1:42:28] read Daniel read a prophecy and it and
[1:42:32] it gripped them here's another one
[1:42:34] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:42:37] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[1:42:40] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[1:42:42] the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[1:42:44] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:42:46] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:42:50] for this corruptible must put on
[1:42:52] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[1:42:54] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:42:56] shall put on incorruption and this
[1:42:58] mortal shall put on immortality then
[1:43:01] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[1:43:03] is written death is swallowed up in
[1:43:05] victory hallelujah that's that's been
[1:43:09] sitting there for nearly two thousand
[1:43:12] years and we see the signs of the times
[1:43:14] around us we see that the world is just
[1:43:17] a you know some crazy man's going to
[1:43:20] push a red button it's all there
[1:43:23] amen if people you know you know if
[1:43:26] people even say well the rapture maybe
[1:43:27] hundred whatever you years ago I mean I
[1:43:30] mean I mean I mean away it's gonna be a
[1:43:32] nuclear war I don't believe it's gonna
[1:43:36] be a hundred years away barbar am said
[1:43:38] at this age you'll be one of the
[1:43:39] shortest ages right as nearly the same
[1:43:41] length as the Ephesian age which i think
[1:43:43] is the shortest one we're going home
[1:43:46] we're going home oh yeah
[1:43:50] I'm glad brother bran was said yo he
[1:43:53] said you shouldn't tell people about the
[1:43:54] coming of Lord it's terrifying them this
[1:43:56] is terrifying no it's the greatest thing
[1:43:58] there is hallelujah it's the most
[1:44:00] wonderful thing you think Lord the one
[1:44:02] who died for me it's gonna carry me away
[1:44:05] olya we're gonna literally see him Amen
[1:44:08] from he's going to take a step this way
[1:44:10] we're gonna take a step towards him and
[1:44:12] we're gonna be gone I want to see my
[1:44:15] Jesus don't you I want to see him face
[1:44:17] to face don't you hallelujah he sees in
[1:44:23] the rapture message but to the church
[1:44:25] the bride the rapture is a revelation to
[1:44:27] her it's revealed to her that the
[1:44:30] revelation the true Bride of Christ will
[1:44:32] be waiting for that revelation of the
[1:44:34] rapture now it is a revelation for the
[1:44:37] revelation is faith you cannot have a
[1:44:40] revelation without it being faith I mean
[1:44:43] faith is a revelation because it's
[1:44:45] something that's revealed to you faith
[1:44:47] is a revelation faith is something that
[1:44:49] has been revealed to you like it was to
[1:44:52] Abraham that could call anything
[1:44:54] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:44:55] him as though it wasn't so Alleluia now
[1:44:59] faith that's what faith is is the
[1:45:01] revelation of God the church is built
[1:45:04] upon a revelation the whole body of
[1:45:06] Christ they say but we know that the
[1:45:09] raptures yes you know the threefold
[1:45:11] coming of the Lord of the of the shout
[1:45:13] the voice in the Trump 1st Thessalonians
[1:45:15] 4 but it hasn't been revealed to you
[1:45:17] amen
[1:45:19] has it been revealed to you that the
[1:45:21] shout is the message right has it been
[1:45:24] revealed to you that the voice of the
[1:45:26] Archangel Amen is the manifestation of
[1:45:28] the word and the bride which will bring
[1:45:30] forth the dead Saints the life of God in
[1:45:34] us will bring them out of the grave
[1:45:36] have been revealed to you amen it's got
[1:45:39] to be revealed because otherwise it's
[1:45:42] just information that a prophet preached
[1:45:45] however many years ago but it has been
[1:45:47] quickened to your soul then it's very
[1:45:49] different
[1:45:51] Alleluia it's a revelation because it's
[1:45:54] a personal walk it's not a group walk so
[1:45:57] it's got to be a revelation personally
[1:45:59] to you amen now well go but more you say
[1:46:10] well it's a responsible to say that you
[1:46:13] know the promises now but faith brings
[1:46:16] the promise into present tense amen it
[1:46:19] doesn't put it far away it sees us now
[1:46:22] abraham believed he'd received the son
[1:46:24] now hallelujah and the next day now the
[1:46:27] next day now he believed because faith
[1:46:29] brings the promise into the present
[1:46:31] unbelief pushes it far away somewhere
[1:46:34] Amen just like people who you know they
[1:46:37] say well one day I'll receive the Holy
[1:46:39] Ghost that's actually unbelief speaking
[1:46:41] I mean you have to believe that he is
[1:46:43] and he's a rewarder of them that
[1:46:46] diligently seek Him I mean that is that
[1:46:48] is what how you got to be you do you
[1:46:50] believe that God is and then he's our a
[1:46:53] water of them that diligently seek Him
[1:46:54] so if you're diligently seeking Him was
[1:46:56] that your faith has been put into action
[1:46:58] I mean but if you say well one day if
[1:47:00] I'm in I'm in I'm out I'm out that's
[1:47:02] unbelief speaking Amen so faith brings
[1:47:07] the promise into the present now he see
[1:47:09] it's for moses describeth the
[1:47:10] righteousness which is of the law that
[1:47:13] the man which doeth those things shall
[1:47:15] live by them but the righteousness which
[1:47:18] is of faith speaketh on this wise say
[1:47:21] not a night heart who shall ascend into
[1:47:23] heaven that is to bring Christ down from
[1:47:25] above or who shall descend from the deep
[1:47:28] that is to bring up Christ again from
[1:47:30] the dead but what saith it the word is
[1:47:34] nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy
[1:47:36] heart that is the Word of Faith which we
[1:47:38] preach that if thou shalt confess with
[1:47:41] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[1:47:42] believe in my heart that God raised him
[1:47:44] from the dead thou shalt be saved
[1:47:47] forth the heart man believeth unto
[1:47:48] righteousness and with the
[1:47:50] confession is made unto salvation so
[1:47:53] saying that the righteous so faith
[1:47:55] speaks like this the word is nigh thee
[1:47:57] even in my mouth in my heart so the
[1:47:59] promise is here is not it's not see she
[1:48:03] says unbelief says who's gonna bring
[1:48:06] Christ either from the grave or from
[1:48:08] heaven to make it come to pass
[1:48:09] how's that gonna happen he's distant
[1:48:11] somewhere but faith doesn't speak that
[1:48:13] way faces the word is nigh thee even in
[1:48:15] thy mouth in my heart since the promises
[1:48:18] present Allu yeah and faith cometh by
[1:48:23] hearing and hearing the Word of God amen
[1:48:26] and how can we believe if the book is
[1:48:31] sealed I mean how can we believe for the
[1:48:34] rapture if the book is sealed the book
[1:48:35] is not sealed the word has come open I
[1:48:38] main faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:48:40] the Word of God so there's a principle
[1:48:42] if you want unbelief don't listen to the
[1:48:44] word right if you want faith listen to
[1:48:47] it if you want faith read it if you want
[1:48:50] faith amen absorb the Word of God what
[1:48:54] do you put in your you you'll get out I
[1:48:56] mean there's what I say and and was the
[1:48:59] devil fight us he tries to get you to
[1:49:01] look good look at anything else I mean
[1:49:05] but the message about the scripture why
[1:49:07] fight you because he doesn't want you to
[1:49:09] have overcoming faith he doesn't want
[1:49:11] you to have rapturing faith I mean he
[1:49:13] doesn't want you to leave this earth he
[1:49:15] wants you to be stuck here in a Great
[1:49:16] Tribulation but we've got a way out
[1:49:19] hallelujah that's why we're going to
[1:49:21] feed our souls on the word amen it does
[1:49:23] you good it'll do your family good I
[1:49:25] mean because if you're spiritually
[1:49:27] strong then that life will now flow into
[1:49:29] your family
[1:49:30] hallelujah but if you're just kindly
[1:49:31] minded and physically weak what happens
[1:49:33] the flesh raises up and then that has
[1:49:35] dominion and no one likes that I mean
[1:49:38] that's why you got to feed on the word
[1:49:39] of God hallelujah because faith cometh
[1:49:43] by hearing amen now we just finish with
[1:49:49] this for perfect faith now it's this
[1:49:53] charge of faith that's going right back
[1:49:55] to begin and come in see the kind of
[1:49:58] raised faith in a bracket where you've
[1:50:00] never noticed it in that way before not
[1:50:03] a faith but a perfect
[1:50:04] faith build it up here and watch a
[1:50:06] perfect God with a perfect heart keep a
[1:50:08] perfect promise by His perfect word
[1:50:10] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:50:12] and a discerner of the thoughts of the
[1:50:13] heart what we're coming now to the
[1:50:16] perfection because the people has to
[1:50:18] come to this in order for the rapture
[1:50:19] that's what's holding it away right now
[1:50:22] is waiting for the for that church to
[1:50:23] come into that perfect raptured faith
[1:50:25] looking forward it means a whole lot of
[1:50:27] shaving down for me it means a lot for
[1:50:29] you but together we'll make it by the
[1:50:32] grace of God amen by His grace and we
[1:50:35] know what grace means as a divine
[1:50:37] influence upon the heart and its
[1:50:38] reflection in the life hallelujah so
[1:50:42] here we are you know eternity is bumping
[1:50:46] into you hallelujah
[1:50:49] I know it's maybe a crude way of saying
[1:50:51] it but eternity is bumping into you and
[1:50:54] you've really got to come and you to
[1:50:56] think about what is affecting me it
[1:51:00] should give you perfect faith God
[1:51:02] doesn't just anoint his bride just for
[1:51:04] fun He pours the spirit out upon us
[1:51:07] quickens is word to our souls gives us
[1:51:10] revelation cuz he's wanting us to see
[1:51:12] you're going all that the father has
[1:51:16] given me shall come to me so if I've
[1:51:21] been given I'm going amen
[1:51:25] and all that come to me I'll no wise
[1:51:27] cast out so if I come to him he's not
[1:51:29] going to cast me out he has to accept me
[1:51:32] hallelujah if I come on faith he has to
[1:51:35] accept me
[1:51:36] he can't reject me hallelujah so we have
[1:51:40] to I just leave it with that afraid are
[1:51:43] we looking we say Lord working that
[1:51:46] rapture to me quicken it to me Lord I
[1:51:50] don't want to be left behind I don't
[1:51:53] just want to be part of the group I mean
[1:51:57] I want to have such a walk with you Lord
[1:51:59] where I know I'm going amen Enoch walked
[1:52:04] with God and was not because God took
[1:52:07] him hallelujah his faith by faith it's

[1:52:27] faith Enoch was translated his faith
[1:52:32] took him in a rapture I know I'm
[1:52:34] repeating myself but if that is your
[1:52:37] shadow if that's the shadow of you
[1:52:38] pointing to a reality what's the reality
[1:52:41] gonna be be by faith the bride was
[1:52:44] translated she was taken from this world
[1:52:47] to the next world so it should be Lord

[1:52:53] your word fill me with the knowledge of
[1:52:56] you not in here revelation anchors down
[1:52:58] into this but into our hearts Lord
