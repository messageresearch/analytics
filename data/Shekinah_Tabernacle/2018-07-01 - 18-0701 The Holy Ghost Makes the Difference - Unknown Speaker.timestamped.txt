[24:02] Amen baby I can see it coming all right
[24:23] being with me I hadn't planned to see
[24:25] this but I just listened to the song I
[24:26] got is tremendous I thought man I got is
[24:28] so tremendous and and so I thought I was
[24:32] really want to share it because then I
[24:33] was encouraged so much as weakened and I
[24:35] just I pray that it encourages you guys
[24:37] so bear with me
[24:38] all right so Rebecca in the girl's head
[24:42] of violin week in so we went away to up
[24:44] to Hamilton and um the teacher said to
[24:47] me okay we need to have one health and
[24:49] safety person like a first-aid person I
[24:51] said okay well my certificate probably
[24:52] expired 10 years ago but if you don't
[24:54] need it to be current but I can deal
[24:56] with anything as fine so she said oh
[24:58] yeah perfect you got the job so that's
[25:00] fine so 35 children and like just a
[25:07] couple of us adults and so we wind up
[25:09] there we got to them at I and and we
[25:12] unpacked everything all the children win
[25:14] and they started practicing their
[25:15] violins and then one of the boys sort of
[25:18] like stumbles out he put his violin away
[25:20] and he's stumbling out of the room so I
[25:22] thought okay what's going on here I
[25:24] don't know he's fine he's fine he's fine
[25:25] he says so then he goes in to have
[25:26] dinner and he gets his plate puts his
[25:28] food on his plate and in some things
[25:30] he's walking and he can't walk straight
[25:32] and it's all slipping off onto the floor
[25:33] so he puts it down on the table goes
[25:35] back up gets another plate and then puts
[25:38] more food on same thing can't even walk
[25:40] leaning against the wall falling off and
[25:42] then his brother comes helps them puts
[25:44] it up so he goes to another table
[25:45] forgets all about his other plate
[25:47] doesn't know what's going on and he's
[25:49] sitting there and aspires are all why do
[25:51] that water would I need water I need
[25:53] water
[25:53] yes so I thought what on earth has gone
[25:55] because I don't know these children very
[25:57] well but I know I've never seen him like
[25:58] this before so so he goes up and he's
[26:01] drinking all of us water it can't even
[26:02] stand up straight so I said okay come
[26:04] come with me let's go and sit down and
[26:06] he I said okay what did you eat on the
[26:08] bus I don't know doesn't know what day
[26:10] does doesn't know areas doesn't know
[26:11] what's going on at all
[26:12] so that okay Lord
[26:15] that I just wonderful being in Christian
[26:17] because you don't have to worry about
[26:18] anything I had such a deep down wrist
[26:20] although I thought okay this is very bad
[26:22] I had that deep breast like it it's okay
[26:24] and so I said to the teacher if we don't
[26:28] if we don't have a quick car here I have
[26:30] to call the ambulance and I want to take
[26:31] him to the A&E and so she said no no
[26:33] someone has a car so he jumped in and on
[26:36] the way to the car I said can I pray for
[26:37] you and he said no everything's
[26:38] everything's going to be okay and
[26:40] there's sort of delirious state Amenas
[26:42] brother having to hold him up and I
[26:45] thought yes I said yes you're right
[26:46] everything is gonna be okay so I just
[26:47] put my hands on his shoulders I thought
[26:49] no the lord has us in control
[26:50] everything's going to be fine so we went
[26:52] to the A&E and while we were sitting
[26:54] there I'm cutting a long story quite a
[26:56] bit short of it while we're sitting
[26:58] there waiting and it was full of babies
[27:00] screaming and everything about seven
[27:02] o'clock and um so we're sitting there
[27:04] waiting and while we're sitting there he
[27:06] just goes limp and his eyes rolled back
[27:07] in his head
[27:08] so he had a bit of a seizure and so I
[27:10] thought okay so quickly he went and got
[27:12] the nurse to come over they took us into
[27:13] a room and just gave him some medication
[27:15] and he just went straight to sleep
[27:17] so that okay all right and um so his
[27:21] older brother and I sitting there he's
[27:22] 17 his parents aren't there or anything
[27:24] you know but I knew the Lord was there
[27:26] with us the whole time
[27:27] and um and so they were so busy so they
[27:31] didn't really weren't really able to see
[27:33] us much at all and they didn't really
[27:36] know what was going on so I was able to
[27:39] talk to his brother and I spoke to him
[27:41] quite a lot
[27:41] they are very sincere Filipino Catholic
[27:45] Christians and so he he talked to me
[27:48] quite a lot it was quite a shy boy and
[27:49] so we were able to spend quite a bit of
[27:51] time talking about just testimonies and
[27:52] just the Lord and it was really really
[27:55] sweet
[27:55] and um and he was quite receptive and
[27:58] open and and it was interesting because
[28:01] just as we finished talking
[28:03] his brother woke up and and he was like
[28:07] a different boy just as I finished
[28:10] sharing testimony with him about fully
[28:12] surrendering your life to the Lord and
[28:13] Andy's testimony in these things and um
[28:15] and I knew but I knew I had to say this
[28:17] one thing but it just hadn't come up
[28:19] about fully surrendering
[28:20] but as soon as I seen it pretty much
[28:22] just then brother woke up and um and he
[28:26] was where and why what's going on
[28:28] I didn't remove anything from after the
[28:30] violin with dinner he didn't mean
[28:31] anything from the until now but then he
[28:34] was like normal he's like oh can we go
[28:36] what are you doing here you know and it
[28:39] was really odd so the doctors came back
[28:42] and they said they were had put all the
[28:43] patches on to take blood tests and they
[28:44] said okay yeah he seems completely
[28:47] normal just wait a bit
[28:49] yeah well probably we don't really know
[28:51] what to do and and so they kept they and
[28:54] in this time I thought because it's been
[28:57] hours it's all it was almost midnight so
[28:59] I'm sitting and I had my Bible in my bag
[29:01] and I was just reading and I'm and I
[29:06] just I was reading actually I started
[29:08] reading from Matthew 24 and I think it's
[29:09] at the end of 25 it says if you've done
[29:12] it to the least of these you've done it
[29:14] unto me and I just felt so privileged I
[29:15] thought that it could be the Lord you
[29:18] know there cuz his brother was saying
[29:19] people don't do this like say thank you
[29:22] so much he said this means so much to me
[29:24] this means so much to my family that you
[29:25] would come and look after my brother
[29:27] like this you know he was blown away he
[29:28] said people people don't do this and so
[29:32] when I read that you know if you do it
[29:35] unto the least of these you doing it
[29:36] unto me so and then and then you have a
[29:40] doctor and I I'm actually I had a
[29:42] migraine the night before and I'd had to
[29:43] go to bed early and ahead sort of that
[29:45] residual bit so I hid the whole day but
[29:47] just been ignoring it but the migraines
[29:48] started to come back and I said to her
[29:51] Lord okay I probably can it because the
[29:52] guy had said okay because he's had a
[29:54] little bit of a seizure we'll need to
[29:55] keep him overnight for monitoring and I
[29:56] knew that that meant that I needed to
[29:57] stay overnight with him so I said to the
[30:00] Lord okay please you have to take away
[30:02] this migraine because I started to feel
[30:04] nauseous and that same type of thing so
[30:06] I said to the lord please take away this
[30:08] migraine so that I can look after him
[30:10] because I know I'm doing this for you
[30:11] and I mean just something seen in my
[30:14] heart you'll be out of here by midnight
[30:15] I looked at the clock and it was five to
[30:17] twelve okay thank you lord that's really
[30:22] really awesome IPPT of this and like I
[30:24] looked outside screaming children
[30:26] everything everywhere and I thought okay
[30:28] doesn't seem possible but we'll just
[30:29] wait and just waited and then yeah but
[30:33] the and they were so busy and with all
[30:35] these horrible things that had happened
[30:36] and in this doctor walked and he said
[30:38] okay I've talked to my consultant and he
[30:40] says because
[30:40] you just out of two minutes down the
[30:42] road you can just monitor and wake in
[30:44] the night wake him check everything's
[30:45] fine in the night sit with him if he
[30:47] sleeps next to you you know then it's
[30:48] fine to go and I thought then that does
[30:50] not happen there does not happen and I
[30:53] decide takes the lady at the place I
[30:55] says okay all as well come and pick me
[30:57] up I looked at the text it was 11:59
[31:01] thank you lord
[31:03] and so just one more quick thing I set
[31:07] with him the whole next day and it's how
[31:09] the Lord actually had it like he
[31:10] obviously had an infection and his
[31:11] temperature was so high that he was
[31:12] delirious and started her hallucinating
[31:15] and seeing stuff in it but in the next
[31:16] day we just kept on top of the pen and
[31:18] oh and things and they kept temperatures
[31:20] stay down but the Lord just he'd seen
[31:21] everything seeing this lady with just
[31:23] the right medicine to help his immunity
[31:24] and build him up and I sit with him in
[31:26] this little room he slipped pretty much
[31:28] the whole day the next day and I was
[31:30] able to just sit there and this quiet
[31:31] little room called the prayer room at
[31:32] this church you know I just have my
[31:35] Bible and I read the Bible pretty much
[31:36] the whole day and people are like are
[31:38] you okay we feel so sorry for you I
[31:40] might know man this is awesome
[31:42] and I just reading about how the all the
[31:47] commandments are summed up in it and at
[31:50] the end of Galatians 5 and it just says
[31:53] and thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[31:55] thyself and I just I've always been what
[31:58] Shannon said is a homeschool motto this
[32:00] is our homeschool philosophy love the
[32:02] Lord your God with all your heart soul
[32:03] mind and strength and love your neighbor
[32:05] as yourself and I thought man that's our
[32:07] philosophy a just expressed love to this
[32:09] hurting world so yeah you can pray for
[32:11] that boy who's um perceive indane his

[49:47] then we're gonna go to Ephesians its
[49:52] exodus 11 6 & 7 it's gonna read to two
[49:59] verses here and then we're gonna go to
[50:00] Ephesians chapter 6
[50:08] so XS 11 chapter Exodus chapter 11
[50:13] verses 6 & 7
[50:14] this is just before they are going to
[50:17] have the Passover and they're going to
[50:18] take the lamb apply the blood as the
[50:21] last plague death is about to strike
[50:24] Egypt and this is Moses speaking and he
[50:27] says and there shall be a great cry
[50:30] throughout all the land of Egypt such as
[50:33] there were none like it nor shall be
[50:36] like it any more but against any of the
[50:39] children of Israel shall not a dog move
[50:43] his tongue against man or beast that ye
[50:46] may know how that the Lord hath put a
[50:50] difference between the Egyptians and
[50:53] Israel they say how the Lord hath put a
[50:57] difference is a big and there's a
[50:59] difference today between the believer in
[51:01] the rest of the world right God's going
[51:04] to put a difference and when we go to
[51:06] Ephesians chapter 6 now just into the
[51:09] New Testament he says you're in
[51:17] Ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren
[51:22] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[51:26] of his might put on the whole armour of
[51:29] God that you may be able to stand
[51:31] against the wiles of the devil for we
[51:34] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[51:38] against principalities against powers
[51:41] against the rulers of the darkness of
[51:44] this world against spiritual wickedness
[51:46] in high places
[51:48] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[51:52] of God
[51:52] we may be able to able to withstand in
[51:55] the evil day and we live in an evil day
[51:57] and having done all to stand stand
[52:00] therefore do not buckle stand having
[52:03] your loins Girt about with truth and
[52:05] having on the breastplate of
[52:07] righteousness and your feet shod with
[52:09] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[52:11] above all taking the shield of faith
[52:14] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[52:16] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[52:20] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[52:22] the Spirit which is the word of God
[52:24] praying always with all prayer and
[52:27] supplication in the spirit and watching
[52:29] thereunto with all perseverance and
[52:31] supplication for All Saints amen may the
[52:35] Lord blesses word you may have your
[52:36] seats this morning I want to continue on
[52:41] I'm just been reading through the
[52:43] scripture and uh last week we talked
[52:45] about Joseph's taking a Gentile bride
[52:47] now I want to talk about well
[52:51] Christianity real Christianity is God
[52:54] into people that's why he died on
[52:56] Calvary that's why you know he shed his
[52:59] life's blood to bridge the chasm between
[53:01] him your God and man that God would take
[53:04] man who was born with a fallen sin
[53:06] nature and would transform that man that
[53:10] they no longer had that fall in sin
[53:12] nature but they received God's nature
[53:13] and God would come and dwell in that man
[53:16] that's the reason that he died
[53:18] is it not Christianity is not just
[53:20] another religion and another nice idea a
[53:22] way of life you know it's more than a
[53:24] moral code or this is not a book of
[53:26] ethics this is this is a this is God
[53:29] revealed right and Christianity now is
[53:32] that the life of the believer is the
[53:35] interpretation of the scripture so when
[53:37] people see you they should bevel and
[53:39] they ask what do you believe you should
[53:41] say just what's my life
[53:43] watch how I treat my family watch how I
[53:45] treat others watch how I you know how I
[53:47] worship God watch how I dress what's
[53:49] what I say was what I do that is the
[53:51] interpretation of the scripture right so
[53:54] it's more than an argument or some ideas
[53:56] it's a life on display amen and then now
[53:59] I bet I want to say this now the devil
[54:02] is also religious he was religious from
[54:05] the beginning
[54:06] for you know because since started in
[54:08] heaven
[54:09] he says I'll make myself like the Most
[54:11] High I'll be worshipped that was his
[54:13] desire I want to be in God
[54:15] I want worship and and he was cast out
[54:17] of heaven and the angels that believed
[54:19] his lie they were cast out and now
[54:21] they're upon the earth and he wants
[54:23] worship from man because God wants
[54:26] worship from man he wants a relationship
[54:27] with man because God wants relationship
[54:30] with man right so the devil's religious
[54:33] as well and we know from the scripture
[54:36] that the and from history that the
[54:37] Egyptians were religious people that
[54:39] would honor an atheistic people their
[54:41] whole life their whole life was revolved
[54:44] around gods and the Pharaoh himself
[54:46] considered himself a god and he was
[54:49] considered the yo that's he is
[54:51] considered the car brother he was the
[54:53] god he was a god and that's why the
[54:55] first thing Moses did as he had the
[54:57] stuff and he cast it down it became a
[54:59] serpent he picked it back up and became
[55:01] a stuff and and God was telling the
[55:04] devil
[55:05] I can loose you I can bind you I can
[55:08] loose you I can bind you I have control
[55:10] in this place there's what God was
[55:12] telling the devil and so and but there
[55:16] are religious people they worshiped they
[55:19] had their temples they had their
[55:20] theology they had their sacred writings
[55:23] but God is saying I'm going to make a
[55:24] difference between you and them and it
[55:28] must be the same thing today there must
[55:30] be a difference between the real
[55:32] believer and the professing believer
[55:34] right there must be a real difference
[55:36] between them who really know their God
[55:39] and those who are merely just a
[55:40] religious people I mean so we need to
[55:43] look into these things because I trust
[55:46] you have not come here just for a
[55:47] religion I trust you ever come here just
[55:49] to well it's a Sunday morning and you
[55:51] know it's in my culture I come to church
[55:53] I am you know I believe the Bible out of
[55:55] tradition and that's going to be more
[55:57] than that I trust you've come because I
[55:59] am redeemed by the blood of the lamb his
[56:02] blood has become effective in my life
[56:04] I'm a cleansed I'm a separated
[56:06] transformed believer
[56:07] I mean I've come to give him worship I
[56:09] trust that's why you here this morning
[56:11] it should be that's the reason Alleluia
[56:15] I don't I don't serve God because you
[56:17] know my parents had
[56:19] and you know see if they were Christians
[56:21] I don't see them because of that i7
[56:23] because I made him he came out of
[56:25] history and made me oh yeah and so now
[56:29] the difference there and in an exodus
[56:31] was they're about to apply the blood of
[56:33] the Lamb he says I'm going to put this
[56:35] difference between you and the Egyptians
[56:37] you're going to take a lamb
[56:38] you're gonna slay that lamb and you're
[56:40] going to put the blood on the door and
[56:42] lentil and this will be the difference
[56:44] between you and the Egyptians oh yeah
[56:47] and not only that they had to take that
[56:51] lamb thank the rooster with bitter herbs
[56:53] they had to eat the whole thing they
[56:55] couldn't just have the you know the nice
[56:58] parts of the word I mean they had to
[57:00] take the whole whole word the whole
[57:03] council they had to become one with it
[57:05] they had to ingest it not just look at
[57:07] all isn't this such a nice cut of lamb
[57:09] and isn't it so wonderful and all this
[57:11] is such a plump fellow and you know it's
[57:13] going to be nice and just talk about how
[57:15] good it is they had to eat it there to
[57:17] become one with their sacrifice they
[57:19] couldn't just put it on the shelf or hit
[57:21] leave the blood you know just enough in
[57:23] a picture of whatever bothered or they
[57:25] had to apply it they had to follow the
[57:27] instructions of the vindicated prophet
[57:29] of the day right and not now the devil
[57:32] would try and whisper to them it's not
[57:33] really that important you know your
[57:36] father was Abraham that's good enough
[57:38] you're circumcised
[57:39] I meant circumcision didn't do any good
[57:42] at that point they could have been
[57:44] circumcised if they didn't apply the
[57:46] blood they would have died the angel
[57:48] would have struck them the only reason
[57:50] that the death angel did not strike them
[57:52] was because the blood was applied
[57:53] hallelujah and is the same thing they
[57:56] had good men good morrow people were in
[57:58] Israel right good morrow people
[58:00] religious people it wouldn't have just
[58:03] been you know there would have been many
[58:04] crying out for the deliverer to come
[58:07] although when will you fulfill your word
[58:09] in my day many good moral people their
[58:16] Levites were there all different kinds
[58:19] of people there they had to apply the
[58:21] blood and if they failed they were the
[58:24] first one would have died right and we
[58:28] must apply the blood
[58:31] and our token today is not the blood of
[58:34] a lamb it's the life that was in Jesus
[58:37] Christ that was released on Calvary
[58:39] comes unto you
[58:40] right because I could have a vial of his
[58:43] blood and the shirt would be precious
[58:44] but just be a relic God doesn't want us
[58:47] to make relics out of anything the life
[58:49] that was in our Lord Jesus must come in
[58:51] you and if it's coming to you and it
[58:53] lives through you you have the target on
[58:55] display and if then when the death angel
[58:57] strikes the world which he is he'll pass
[59:00] over you your safe is safe can be that
[59:04] is the difference right and it's more
[59:07] than just being anointed because jesus
[59:10] said in this last days many false
[59:12] Christ's many false Christ's would arise
[59:16] and deceive many Christ means Anointed
[59:19] One so you can be anointed and still be
[59:22] a devil you can still be anointed you
[59:24] can be anointing to still be unconverted
[59:26] rights you're going to be more than just
[59:28] other men are such a wonderful
[59:29] atmosphere what happens when you leave
[59:31] church whatever is from from about
[59:34] winner on Sunday afternoon tool if you
[59:36] come on Wednesday if you come next
[59:38] Sunday
[59:38] what's your life in the between time
[59:40] because we can be caught up in an
[59:42] atmosphere and we can worship but we
[59:44] have a wonderful time
[59:45] and we can rejoice and those things are
[59:47] all real but it's got to have a
[59:49] permanent change that's the difference
[59:52] as a permanent life it's not just you're
[59:55] here and rejoicing your life was a
[59:57] worship I mean how you respond to each
[1:00:00] other how you dress what the things you
[1:00:02] watch the things you do it's a worship
[1:00:04] David said I'll not let any evil before
[1:00:06] my face amen
[1:00:09] I think that's a good way to live that's
[1:00:12] the problem with the societies they let
[1:00:14] Hollywood pour a bunch of filth on their
[1:00:16] necks and they take it because that's
[1:00:18] preaching to you you know that I mean
[1:00:20] the music people isn't do the things
[1:00:22] that watch that's a sermon and these
[1:00:24] emissions have slipped into that and it
[1:00:26] changes people's thinking and how you
[1:00:28] know how they look at life and the
[1:00:31] people just wallow in it isn't this
[1:00:32] wonderful and being entertained isn't
[1:00:34] this glorious and they're being totally
[1:00:36] twisted up I mean that's why Irene you
[1:00:39] got to put on the whole armor of God the
[1:00:41] armor is not a natural armor it's a
[1:00:43] stripper net
[1:00:44] right it's the anointing of God in your
[1:00:46] life see abiding prisons of Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] probably that's what you've got to have
[1:00:51] no understand without him in the stage
[1:00:54] it's just that simple
[1:00:55] you're either equipped for the battle
[1:00:57] were you just a sitting duck on the
[1:01:00] battlefield who would go to war without
[1:01:02] a weapon I know you talked about this in
[1:01:04] Sunday school but here we are you know
[1:01:06] who would go you know without a weapon
[1:01:08] and would we go to war with some antique
[1:01:11] musket would we put on some red coats
[1:01:14] like the British stood you know 200
[1:01:16] years ago and line up pull them up fix
[1:01:19] bayonets
[1:01:20] oh we're gonna win no we'd get massacred
[1:01:22] we'd get massacred you can't equip
[1:01:26] yourself with Luther's message I mean
[1:01:31] that's not even a musket you can't equip
[1:01:34] yourself just with Wiz Lee's message
[1:01:35] that's antiquated warfare it worked in
[1:01:38] their day the musket worked at Waterloo
[1:01:40] it won't work today
[1:01:42] right the tactics they used at Waterloo
[1:01:45] that defeated Napoleon that worked then
[1:01:47] they tried those tactics in World War
[1:01:50] one you ever started World War one they
[1:01:52] went over the trench they marched
[1:01:54] towards the enemy's trench that's the
[1:01:56] initial stages of the war they were
[1:01:58] mourned down by machine-gun fire they
[1:02:00] don't have machine guns and water you
[1:02:01] know in Napoleon's day but then they ate
[1:02:05] that you know then they change their
[1:02:06] tactics they didn't just walk
[1:02:08] they were running they were took you're
[1:02:09] moving for cover covering each other
[1:02:11] they change their tactics we have to
[1:02:14] change our tactics we need today's
[1:02:17] weapon right we need today's weapon
[1:02:21] because the weapons of world war ii will
[1:02:23] not help you on this day if we went to
[1:02:25] war with what my great-uncle was
[1:02:27] fighting in north africa with it
[1:02:29] wouldn't do any good we just get picked
[1:02:31] off like flies and the same thing the
[1:02:34] Pentecostal message will not help today
[1:02:37] right because they denominated they took
[1:02:40] a man's title right they made their
[1:02:43] creats they made the church and they
[1:02:44] died hallelujah we got to go beyond that
[1:02:48] meant that this message will never do
[1:02:50] nominate but this message is Jesus
[1:02:52] Christ right this Living Word it's not
[1:02:55] you can't put God in a box you can't
[1:02:57] just say well this is how it is God
[1:02:59] cannot be boxed history is proved it
[1:03:02] they tried to make the lutheran box he
[1:03:04] says I'll not be bound by this book
[1:03:06] hallelujah all the way down through
[1:03:08] histories being that way it's the same
[1:03:10] thing today God could not be boxed
[1:03:13] hallelujah we need today's work brother
[1:03:16] Bram says this entire message meets in
[1:03:18] time condition that means it's the
[1:03:21] weapon for today this word has been
[1:03:23] released you as the weapon for today
[1:03:25] that's why we're not ignorant to the
[1:03:27] devil's devices it's not a big bunch of
[1:03:31] conspiracy theory we see what he's doing
[1:03:33] in the political realm and the religious
[1:03:34] realm entertainment whatever realm
[1:03:36] others we see him we're not explained
[1:03:40] Lee walking along and what's happening
[1:03:42] we know what's happening amen
[1:03:47] you know the best you know the best
[1:03:49] thing to do if you're in a battle pick
[1:03:51] your battlefield if you can pick your
[1:03:54] battlefield you have the advantage right
[1:03:56] if you do not get to pick your
[1:03:58] battlefield you can be at disadvantage
[1:03:59] because the enemy can prepare the
[1:04:01] battlefield right and you can just walk
[1:04:03] into a death trap amen we have to and
[1:04:08] but the only way you can pick your
[1:04:09] battlefield to see where your enemy is
[1:04:11] if you do not see where he is then you
[1:04:15] just walk into his ambush amen and
[1:04:18] that's why brother Graham says with the
[1:04:19] opening of the seals Satan's just being
[1:04:21] stripped down he's being exposed here he
[1:04:23] was the first say to second h3 h4 h v 8
[1:04:26] 6 agent he's here today hallelujah I'm
[1:04:32] glad that's the case aren't you glad I'd
[1:04:35] be glad thank you Lord you've given me
[1:04:37] battlefield intelligence I know where my
[1:04:40] enemy is I know what he did in the
[1:04:42] beginning with the sermon saying yay
[1:04:45] hath God said and here's a kiss here's a
[1:04:48] being that doesn't have a relationship
[1:04:50] with God knows nothing of a young over
[1:04:53] of relationship as in father to children
[1:04:55] he says yay hath God said if Eve was
[1:04:57] really smart she would have said maybe
[1:04:59] she could have seen why don't know just
[1:05:01] cause my husband and then he would have
[1:05:04] said no God has said and it would have
[1:05:06] been the end of it right but the devil
[1:05:08] always tries to put the quick
[1:05:09] you mock where does that question lead
[1:05:12] you that's going to be the question
[1:05:13] where's this questioningly gonna lead
[1:05:16] you if you pay heed to it
[1:05:18] hallelujah now we need to put on the
[1:05:22] whole armor of God you got to have the
[1:05:24] life it's more than a cliche I have the
[1:05:27] Holy Ghost because many people say they
[1:05:29] have the Holy Ghost and their life
[1:05:31] proofs they do not right and that's the
[1:05:34] biggest that's the biggest robbery the
[1:05:36] devil can actually make you believe
[1:05:37] you're a Christian without a real birth
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] this is Jesus told the parable the five
[1:05:46] why's the five foolish virgin they all
[1:05:48] thought they were going but when the
[1:05:50] midnight cry came behold the bridegroom
[1:05:52] cometh and they woke up and five said
[1:05:55] five were foolish what someone is forced
[1:05:58] they don't take things seriously they
[1:06:00] just want to skip along real happy and
[1:06:02] free well they think they are you know
[1:06:04] sure they're being foolish with their
[1:06:07] salvation I don't want to be foolish
[1:06:10] with my salvation right I want to know
[1:06:13] that my experience matches God's Bible
[1:06:15] right and in my life that's being lived
[1:06:17] out of me matches his Bible right that's
[1:06:20] what we want to be sure there's still
[1:06:22] the fruit of the Spirit are still real
[1:06:23] today right a manifest manifestation of
[1:06:26] God's life of the people that's still
[1:06:28] real today right we're not just here to
[1:06:31] happy stuff shirts and never you know
[1:06:33] all I have this religion whatever it's
[1:06:35] got to be a life it's got to live amen
[1:06:40] and those five foolish they didn't go
[1:06:43] into the marriage and it was too late
[1:06:46] for them to get the oil the oils the
[1:06:47] Holy Ghost but yet they were there with
[1:06:50] the wise they men make you calling
[1:06:55] election Shore amen we live in a day
[1:07:01] where we need to pre certain you know I
[1:07:04] I just got an email this morning where
[1:07:09] so the Jews know this is a side note but
[1:07:11] the Jews is a there's a sacrifice of a
[1:07:15] red heifer in the Old Testament and then
[1:07:17] you didn't take that red heifer it's got
[1:07:19] to be purely without blemish a red
[1:07:21] heifer and they and they
[1:07:23] if I set they take the ashes mixing with
[1:07:26] water and different things and they used
[1:07:27] that to purify the priesthood and then
[1:07:30] the priest can go on to service without
[1:07:32] that the priest could not go into
[1:07:33] service first and the Jews are looking
[1:07:36] for this red heifer and Rabbi Richman
[1:07:39] who's in charge of the temple Institute
[1:07:40] he says that they have it they have it
[1:07:44] just came out now the real red here for
[1:07:48] they need is Christ cause this washed by
[1:07:51] the water of the word right that's what
[1:07:55] they really need but they're looking for
[1:07:56] that because they say we need this and
[1:07:57] then we can you know and then we can
[1:07:59] purify the priesthood because they found
[1:08:01] out who the priest sir then they can
[1:08:03] rebuild the temple they these people are
[1:08:07] dedicated they are and they know nothing
[1:08:10] of of where goddess today all they have
[1:08:13] is history and the Old Testament but
[1:08:16] God's moved on but yet they're very
[1:08:18] devout people because God is moving
[1:08:20] cause these I hope will be 144,000 of
[1:08:22] them that will receive the same Jesus we
[1:08:24] know after we're in the rapture but they
[1:08:27] are very devout people I'm not taking
[1:08:29] you know I think we should give them
[1:08:30] some credit for that at this and if
[1:08:34] that's all they have they don't have a
[1:08:35] Living Christ they don't have a living
[1:08:38] Messiah all they have is history a God
[1:08:42] of yesterday not a God of today and then
[1:08:46] there any diligent what about us what
[1:08:50] about us
[1:08:51] Oh God live live in my life come and
[1:08:55] manifest in me Oh Lord anoint my life
[1:08:58] more than just a form you know
[1:09:01] Christianity is not just a you're a
[1:09:03] Reformation I work at this book that I
[1:09:05] work at this point I work at this point
[1:09:06] and now I'm doing this there's no what
[1:09:08] Christianity is Christianity's our death
[1:09:10] a burial and a resurrection where you
[1:09:14] literally die
[1:09:15] you ought to die right you don't just
[1:09:18] reform yourself that old nature must die
[1:09:21] you're gonna stay there until he changes
[1:09:24] you amen and then you come forth in
[1:09:26] units of life that's always the biggest
[1:09:29] struggle people aren't willing to die
[1:09:30] they want to keep their fig leaf
[1:09:33] religion and
[1:09:34] walking on but the first thing god that
[1:09:36] he took all the fig leaves off Adam and
[1:09:37] Eve said you're covering won't do you
[1:09:39] any good that every leaf had to go
[1:09:42] before those lambs kids could come on
[1:09:44] them right and it's the same thing but
[1:09:46] people want to bring their old religion
[1:09:48] into the new Paul said I counted all but
[1:09:51] dung that's what he valued his education
[1:09:54] his studies he was a devout man I'm a
[1:09:56] Pharisee the Pharisees he said but he
[1:09:59] said I can't at all but dung that I may
[1:10:01] win Christ what about you well I've done
[1:10:05] heaps for God you got a cattle but dang
[1:10:07] of it's from the denomination a men I
[1:10:12] want to have the whole armour of God now
[1:10:16] I was going to read a few things then
[1:10:19] when men when man fell everyone happy
[1:10:25] then when man fell he lost us and now
[1:10:29] what he lost in the fall Christ came as
[1:10:32] a redeemer did you ever stop us think
[1:10:34] what Christ redeemed us for he gave us
[1:10:36] everlasting life he brought us back to
[1:10:38] eternal fellowship and relationship to
[1:10:40] God to be his sons and daughters again
[1:10:42] to restore back all that adam and adam
[1:10:44] lost in the fall now the thing of it is
[1:10:46] since he has restored man back to this
[1:10:49] place man in the fall has lost his
[1:10:51] conscious of what father put him here on
[1:10:55] earth to do in other words all the
[1:10:58] plumbing as it was in our brain their
[1:11:00] outlets the faith has been clogged up
[1:11:02] with business affair with home life
[1:11:04] domestic things it's all become so
[1:11:06] clogged up with that until god can't
[1:11:09] operate through those channels that god
[1:11:12] that he made a man for so people he lost
[1:11:16] consciousness of what father put him on
[1:11:18] earth to do you know and i think it it's
[1:11:22] good ones role to say lord what is my
[1:11:24] purpose of being why am I here why am i
[1:11:28] here upon the earth it's more than just
[1:11:31] to exist there's a reason you were here
[1:11:33] in this hour you're not here haphazardly
[1:11:35] God doesn't it's not like some big
[1:11:38] lottery but in like the numbers come out
[1:11:40] every suffered and he came you out and
[1:11:42] he said you to the earth he knew you'd
[1:11:43] be here right and there's a reason
[1:11:46] you're here
[1:11:47] and you here to manifest his word to
[1:11:50] this dying world
[1:11:51] you're here to manifest him right that
[1:11:54] he would take you and live through you
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:59] sure we we have families that's good
[1:12:02] we have jobs that's good right we have
[1:12:05] church we have different things that's
[1:12:07] good but what are we here for all those
[1:12:11] things encompass it right if you you
[1:12:13] know if you're a mother God made you a
[1:12:15] mother if your father God made you a
[1:12:16] father right and those are godly offices
[1:12:20] you know but don't just get caught up
[1:12:23] don't miss the main thing why are your
[1:12:26] father that God would manifest himself
[1:12:29] through your family why your mother that
[1:12:33] God would manifest himself through you
[1:12:35] to your family right which men to be
[1:12:38] channels of his anointing hallelujah now
[1:12:49] he says now when God made the human body
[1:12:53] every little part of it had place to
[1:12:56] play the teeth the tongue the eyes the
[1:12:58] nose God does everything in there to
[1:13:00] make it perfect in operation to make the
[1:13:03] man to live and if God so I patterned
[1:13:05] the man the body of a man how much more
[1:13:08] has he patent and set in order the body
[1:13:10] of Christ the church if God designed
[1:13:12] man's body
[1:13:13] he certainly designed the body of a son
[1:13:15] the church and he's designed us to come
[1:13:17] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:13:19] Jesus and have these supernatural
[1:13:21] workings of God outlets through gifts of
[1:13:24] the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom
[1:13:26] knowledge gifts of healing and all these
[1:13:28] other different gifts as outlets that
[1:13:30] God let's uh let's out his power and
[1:13:33] lets out his revelation to the people
[1:13:35] it's not so much an individual so it's
[1:13:37] not and not as an individual so much but
[1:13:41] as a unit we're all together one great
[1:13:44] body of believers now the thing is we
[1:13:49] are in a war there's a war between
[1:13:51] there's a conflict between God and Satan
[1:13:53] being lived out now war causes some
[1:13:57] soldiers to get amnesia shell-shocked
[1:14:00] whose
[1:14:01] - Oh Jacques where the under bombardment
[1:14:03] so much they just can't take it anymore
[1:14:05] they have a breakdown and then they
[1:14:08] forget who they are this this world we
[1:14:13] live in a in a battlefield and this
[1:14:16] world has been bombarding the devil's
[1:14:18] been firing artillery at us since we
[1:14:21] were born because God wants us to know
[1:14:25] who we are the devil does not want us to
[1:14:27] know who we are in God the devil does
[1:14:31] not want you to know who you are in
[1:14:32] Jesus Christ he does not want you to
[1:14:35] know your position he does not want you
[1:14:37] to know your authority over him he does
[1:14:41] not the devil does not want you to know
[1:14:43] these things
[1:14:44] amen the devil does not want you to know
[1:14:46] that Jesus Christ has redeemed you to
[1:14:49] the position that Adam fell from right
[1:14:52] Adam was God over the earth and Adam and
[1:14:55] Eve there one right the devil does not
[1:14:57] want you to know that you are above him
[1:15:01] then he is under your feet
[1:15:03] there you have dominion over him the
[1:15:05] devil does not want you to know these
[1:15:06] things right some of the greatest
[1:15:09] military defeats is because the the ones
[1:15:13] defeated received the wrong intelligence
[1:15:15] about their attacker and they actually
[1:15:18] received a lie and they capitulated they
[1:15:21] lost the battle because the enemy
[1:15:23] actually spread lies they receive the
[1:15:26] wrong intelligence and that's why they
[1:15:28] gave up well we can't win this battle
[1:15:30] but if they really thought they would
[1:15:32] have won and it's the same thing with
[1:15:34] you and I if God can just pour into our
[1:15:37] hearts what he's made us and not just
[1:15:41] for a Sunday morning but every moment of
[1:15:43] the day our position in him and the
[1:15:46] authority we really have right now not
[1:15:49] in the future you know the Bible says
[1:15:51] now we are the sons of God right now I
[1:15:55] mean right now we're in seated in
[1:15:57] heavenly places in Christ Jesus right
[1:15:59] now right now we're cleanse from sin
[1:16:02] right now we are right now the devil's
[1:16:04] Luster's hold right now
[1:16:07] right now by a stripes were healed right
[1:16:09] now right now we are redeemed right now
[1:16:12] hallelujah right now The Devil's under
[1:16:14] our feet right now not in the future
[1:16:16] right now that's why God has to open our
[1:16:19] eyes that the victory that he yeah it's
[1:16:22] more than a story he died on the cross
[1:16:23] it's a reality but as the anchor has to
[1:16:27] go from here down to here that he
[1:16:29] carried you're sending it up Calvary
[1:16:31] that day and it's done right now
[1:16:34] hallelujah but the devil doesn't want
[1:16:37] you to know those things amen and that's
[1:16:40] why he tries to twist you all kind of
[1:16:42] way keep you in this flesh get you
[1:16:44] looking at the here and now in all the
[1:16:45] situation's away and you forget who you
[1:16:47] are now with that in mind you see when
[1:16:53] people get away from God and won't
[1:16:55] listen to the word have no more desire
[1:16:59] for the word then there's one diagnosis
[1:17:01] to it the soul that sinneth that soul
[1:17:04] shall die unbelief shall separate you
[1:17:06] from God that's exactly right but he
[1:17:08] knew what the disease what the results
[1:17:11] were when he seen the disease of sin in
[1:17:13] the city now this amnesia we're told it
[1:17:16] is a cause you to be to a place that you
[1:17:19] cannot identify yourself now it's an
[1:17:23] unusual thing it don't happen too often
[1:17:26] but the cases is from shock it's
[1:17:28] somebody that doesn't even know who they
[1:17:31] are they find it from war sometimes
[1:17:33] soldiers get it sometimes people get it
[1:17:35] another thing it could think cause it is
[1:17:38] worry worry will cause it worry has no
[1:17:41] virtue at all no just skip worry and
[1:17:44] accept faith so amnesia says makes you
[1:17:48] forget your identity makes you forget
[1:17:51] and that's why people people are looking
[1:17:53] for an identity in this hour and it
[1:17:55] depends what age you are that's what
[1:17:57] y'all identify worth so for example when
[1:17:59] I was young and I worshipped cricket I
[1:18:01] wanted to be Danny Morrison
[1:18:02] he was my identity I don't can't
[1:18:05] remember if the black camps were called
[1:18:06] the Black Caps in those days but you
[1:18:08] know when they lost I was devastated
[1:18:10] because that was my identity if they
[1:18:12] were winning I was winning and they if
[1:18:14] they lost I lost hallelujah and then boo
[1:18:18] then when I get a bit older I saw
[1:18:20] something
[1:18:21] and I wanted to be like Russell Coutts
[1:18:22] with the America's Cup I wanted to be
[1:18:24] him that's because I used to sail as
[1:18:26] well since my identity right I wanted to
[1:18:28] be become like him because I was looking
[1:18:30] for an identity and then as you get
[1:18:32] older you're always looking looking
[1:18:34] looking and then I wanted to be like you
[1:18:37] know sports stars whatever more but then
[1:18:40] eventually Jesus came and he said no
[1:18:43] this is your identity you're not meant
[1:18:45] to be a gamer and a winner and a music
[1:18:48] fiend in whatever more you know making
[1:18:50] homebrew all this stuff no that's not
[1:18:52] you he came he says that's not you this
[1:18:54] is who you are I'll show you who you are
[1:18:57] and that's what the message make the
[1:18:59] Bible live mate Jesus Christ came out of
[1:19:02] history because I heard a prophet say
[1:19:03] you know he preached Redemption and
[1:19:05] completeness and enjoy and so why so
[1:19:08] many fails to keep the victory oh I
[1:19:11] found no God say no you need to die you
[1:19:14] need to give up all these things place
[1:19:16] you place yourself on my altar on my
[1:19:19] wheel I'll mold you and shape you you
[1:19:21] know I didn't look for how to reform I
[1:19:23] just said God take everything out of my
[1:19:25] life this country to your word that you
[1:19:27] can dwell in me that was my prayer and
[1:19:29] God began to deal and then now he can
[1:19:32] then he came and dwelt in me hallelujah
[1:19:35] I mean that's all you got to keep your
[1:19:37] focus on him
[1:19:38] don't look at all the other stuff that
[1:19:40] all disappear well I got this and this
[1:19:42] to worry about now look under Jesus Amen
[1:19:46] if you have real faith he'll take you to
[1:19:48] the new birth hallelujah so worried we
[1:19:55] just read there you say well I haven't
[1:19:56] been in battle and you know but worry
[1:20:00] can cause you to lose your identity
[1:20:02] don't worry as he says skip the worry
[1:20:06] and just accept faith amen someone said
[1:20:12] well now what if you're going to be shot
[1:20:14] in the morning wouldn't you worry
[1:20:16] I said no don't think so what I said
[1:20:19] worry couldn't do nothing but make me
[1:20:23] worse why worry
[1:20:26] what can worry do has worried helped
[1:20:29] anyone ever then why are we trying to
[1:20:32] worry
[1:20:34] our selves that's a good is that a good
[1:20:37] question you know what's the end result
[1:20:40] hasn't helped you well what's good is it
[1:20:43] gonna have faith I see it might deliver
[1:20:45] me that's right see so worried has no
[1:20:49] virtue to it at all but faith has all
[1:20:51] virtue belief now worry sometimes cause
[1:20:54] it with a spin around amnesia and
[1:20:56] another thing that calls it among the
[1:20:58] people is getting between two opinions
[1:21:00] this is really I want to want to get to
[1:21:03] you get between two opinions you begin
[1:21:05] to lose your identity well as the
[1:21:07] message right is the Bible accurate or
[1:21:10] is it not and then people are tossed to
[1:21:13] and fro and they forget who they are
[1:21:15] because they're looking at these little
[1:21:17] issues with God who's the God that
[1:21:21] called you what called you in the
[1:21:23] beginning as I see nothing last Sunday
[1:21:26] you know Jesus he the other he was
[1:21:28] you're the woman touched the hem of His
[1:21:29] garment virtue came out of and he says
[1:21:32] who touched me
[1:21:33] someone made contact and changed him
[1:21:36] right and changed her to because she got
[1:21:38] healed but then you gotta ask the
[1:21:40] question oh you got to flip it around
[1:21:41] and you say who touched you spiritually
[1:21:45] what got a hold of your life what was it
[1:21:48] my Peter James and John a man just walks
[1:21:51] past look like any other man come follow
[1:21:53] me telling him this is okay I'll follow
[1:21:55] you I follow him miracles happen
[1:21:59] he never spake like any other man he's
[1:22:02] standing here in John chapter 6 and they
[1:22:03] see eat my flesh drink my blood you have
[1:22:06] no life in you doesn't explain it there
[1:22:09] was a 70 there that he commissioned to
[1:22:12] go do miracles there's five thousand
[1:22:14] they all left and then now his Peter
[1:22:17] James and John then and the disciples
[1:22:19] and Jesus just tense him and and and he
[1:22:21] just says will you go also he just asked
[1:22:23] the question will you go please read it
[1:22:25] imagine that he wasn't saying please
[1:22:29] don't leave me he's not will you go I'm
[1:22:32] giving you a way out if you want to
[1:22:34] here's your way and the impedance says
[1:22:37] to whom shall we go thou have the words
[1:22:38] of eternal life maybe saying I don't
[1:22:40] know something got ahold of me is
[1:22:43] something within me they've got a hold
[1:22:45] of the range
[1:22:46] they couldn't explain it what do you
[1:22:49] what does he mean by that I don't know
[1:22:51] but I'm gripped this is amazing what
[1:22:55] Peter said I'm gripped his words have
[1:22:57] gripped me I don't know exactly where
[1:22:58] it's going to take me but I am sure that
[1:23:00] he is the Christ he is the Christ and he
[1:23:04] followed him and they ended up in heaven
[1:23:06] I think that's a good destination
[1:23:09] he couldn't fill in the between and the
[1:23:11] and don't whatever more you know just
[1:23:16] let go let God have his way what got
[1:23:19] ahold of you you got to ask the question
[1:23:22] what got ahold of me I guarantee you it
[1:23:25] wasn't a religion it wasn't a different
[1:23:27] way of life or just a nice idea it's God
[1:23:30] as Jesus Christ hallelujah so don't be
[1:23:36] between two opinions either God is right
[1:23:39] or he's wrong and in my opinion he's
[1:23:41] right this one is true hallelujah I mean
[1:23:46] I think we should be contending for the
[1:23:48] faith for something not against full
[1:23:52] hallelujah this is in the book of Jude
[1:23:55] contending for the faith that was once
[1:23:57] delivered to the Saints we should get in
[1:23:59] for it I mean so we should contend for
[1:24:01] God dwelling in people we should contend
[1:24:04] in you know the devil being defeated we
[1:24:07] should continue for divine healing we
[1:24:09] should contend for Peace Love joy
[1:24:11] long-suffering patience price meekness
[1:24:13] temperance we should be contending for
[1:24:16] those things
[1:24:17] shouldn't we we should be contending for
[1:24:19] the reality I just praying before I said
[1:24:21] Lord the skies full of the genuine
[1:24:24] brother I said why take a substitute
[1:24:26] when the skies full of the genuine
[1:24:28] Pentecostal blessings the reality of God
[1:24:30] I said God I don't want a substitute if
[1:24:34] the sky is full of the real let's have
[1:24:37] the real
[1:24:38] I mean what why put up with a substitute
[1:24:41] adjust some words I want a reality
[1:24:46] absolutely if God is he's not a
[1:24:48] historical God
[1:24:50] I'm sure it's anchored in your soul by
[1:24:52] now he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:54] forever he does not change totally
[1:24:58] doesn't matter what happens in the world
[1:25:00] God is the same and if he's the same he
[1:25:02] will transform us children like he did
[1:25:04] at the beginning he'll do the same thing
[1:25:06] now so the woman of the world she had no
[1:25:08] man problem after that
[1:25:09] hallelujah shouldn't go back to that man
[1:25:11] she was living with she went and went to
[1:25:13] a new life Legion didn't go back to any
[1:25:16] tombs hallelujah I mean they you know
[1:25:20] there's a funeral procession for a big
[1:25:23] boy Jesus came along he interrupts every
[1:25:25] funeral procession he came back to life
[1:25:27] that boy didn't go back and die Justine
[1:25:30] he lived right should be the same thing
[1:25:33] with you something's happened to me
[1:25:36] NOLA lujah I believe it I've experienced
[1:25:40] it I don't want to go back to any just
[1:25:42] you know I remember sitting in an
[1:25:44] Anglican Church big old organ you know
[1:25:48] kneel say this Dan say this say this
[1:25:50] appreciate this you say this I don't
[1:25:53] want anything like that I don't just
[1:25:56] want something formal thing amen God
[1:25:58] doesn't want us to have some formal
[1:26:00] religion he wants a reality amen
[1:26:06] it'll cause amnesia being between two
[1:26:09] opinions and it gets you to a place
[1:26:11] where actually what what you've done
[1:26:15] you've lost your reasons you've lost
[1:26:16] your mind you can't make you don't know
[1:26:19] who you are
[1:26:20] so I said the devil doesn't want you to
[1:26:22] know who you are he will cause you to
[1:26:24] worry he'll cause you to be between two
[1:26:27] opinions right see you're bouncing
[1:26:29] around these or things you forget who
[1:26:31] you are in the love you can't identify
[1:26:35] yourself you can walk around eat and
[1:26:37] everything but you still can't identify
[1:26:38] yourself
[1:26:39] you've got your scholarly education you
[1:26:43] can't same education your head but you
[1:26:45] don't know where it come from you don't
[1:26:47] know who you are where you belong that's
[1:26:49] amnesia so we're told God does
[1:26:52] want us to be in this condition he
[1:26:54] doesn't want us to be stumbling around
[1:26:56] Who am I
[1:26:58] that's a big question people Who am I
[1:27:00] where do i I that's why there's a gender
[1:27:03] fluidity and all these things as people
[1:27:05] looking for where do they belong you let
[1:27:09] God reveal himself to you one time
[1:27:10] you'll know where you belong now we'll
[1:27:18] go here see Satan wasn't that bunch of
[1:27:23] Jewish teachers and rabbis and priests
[1:27:25] trying to tell them to keep the law of
[1:27:27] Moses when the very word said that in
[1:27:29] that day the Son of Man would be
[1:27:31] revealed see that he would reveal
[1:27:33] himself so they was trying as long as
[1:27:37] they kept them religious and on the law
[1:27:39] of Moses so what he did he was trying to
[1:27:43] tell them that part of the word is just
[1:27:46] exactly right but this man isn't that
[1:27:48] person trying to tell about the Messiah
[1:27:51] yes it's true he will come he will do
[1:27:54] these things versus not him we're
[1:27:56] looking for another right and that's
[1:27:58] what the devil does he tries to always
[1:28:01] the word it's always the contention
[1:28:03] that's why Peter says to be established
[1:28:04] in the present truth who's read that and
[1:28:08] one of his epistles he'll be established
[1:28:10] in the present truth that's what you
[1:28:13] need to be because it's where the
[1:28:14] present is that's where the devil's
[1:28:16] fighting and as regattas I mean he will
[1:28:19] let you know all that Moses did the
[1:28:21] devil he'll let you know all that what
[1:28:23] Moses was fine was perfectly well what
[1:28:25] John the Baptist did was probably fine
[1:28:26] what Jesus did was perfectly fine what
[1:28:30] the Apostles will do fine but when it
[1:28:32] comes to the promise of this day that's
[1:28:35] where he says no it's not true that
[1:28:36] doesn't apply here this is for someone
[1:28:38] else and if he could just keep you with
[1:28:41] that mindset then you'll never actually
[1:28:43] be in contact with the Living God
[1:28:45] because he's the I am right amen
[1:28:51] now see how see how deceiving that is
[1:28:54] that's the real day of deception it's
[1:28:57] been and now is Satan establishing his
[1:29:00] kingdom in the earth that's exactly why
[1:29:02] he's doing it for he wants to establish
[1:29:04] his own Kingdom as
[1:29:05] businessman there's not a Christian he
[1:29:08] will work every scheme he can make and
[1:29:11] he can to make you see something the
[1:29:13] wrong way if he's got a purpose and a
[1:29:15] personal gain and making you do that
[1:29:18] making you see it that way he will show
[1:29:21] you everything he can and keep you off
[1:29:24] from the truth of it because he's got a
[1:29:29] feeling only for himself no matter how
[1:29:31] much he lies and cheats and whatever
[1:29:33] more he's got personal gain and that's
[1:29:36] why Satan's done this and he's worked
[1:29:38] through the ministry to do it as God
[1:29:41] promised he would do amen now he said he
[1:29:48] would exalt himself above the most high
[1:29:50] see that in in the beginning he would
[1:29:52] have sinned above the clouds and the
[1:29:53] stars and he would sit there like God
[1:29:55] and be above the most high and he has
[1:29:58] succeeded in carrying out his threats as
[1:30:01] isaiah 14 he has certainly had a
[1:30:04] marvelous success in carrying out his
[1:30:06] threats by people letting him explain by
[1:30:11] letting people explain away in every age
[1:30:13] the value of god's promised word to that
[1:30:16] age that's all he has to do
[1:30:19] diminish the value of the word for your
[1:30:21] day right what happened when Jesus was
[1:30:25] here they tried to diminish the value of
[1:30:29] him we know you are a devil
[1:30:32] you're a Samaritan you know you're not
[1:30:36] the Promised One
[1:30:37] you're not the Messiah well diminishing
[1:30:39] the value of the word for their day
[1:30:41] right by letting the people explain it
[1:30:44] so it took explaining away they
[1:30:45] explained Jesus ministry away do you
[1:30:48] know they did he was dead buried
[1:30:51] resurrected whole whole troop of Roman
[1:30:54] soldiers around that tomb the angel
[1:30:56] comes down they fall down as dead men
[1:30:59] run away terrified the stones are all
[1:31:01] the way then they come to the high
[1:31:03] priest this is what happened this is our
[1:31:05] testimony you thought about that he
[1:31:07] comes to Centurion Oh high priest sir oh
[1:31:09] I know what he said you know we were
[1:31:12] there we were guarding it but in the
[1:31:14] third day an angel came down I don't
[1:31:17] think I don't think I said sure
[1:31:19] we were smoking about an angel and in
[1:31:21] the debrief you know you think about it
[1:31:24] and then what did they what are the
[1:31:26] Highbridge to just take this money just
[1:31:27] just tell everyone that the disciples
[1:31:30] stole his body and that's commonly told
[1:31:34] they explained it away I mean if they
[1:31:38] did it that day they will explain Jesus
[1:31:42] away today right they just explain him
[1:31:45] away well this and this and whatever
[1:31:47] hold on it doesn't change the fact that
[1:31:49] happened right Jesus is but a footnote
[1:31:53] in history do you know that he has but a
[1:31:56] footnote in history yet and people
[1:31:59] explain they say about the virgin birth
[1:32:01] or some soldier impregnated Mary really
[1:32:05] they're just explaining it away and it's
[1:32:09] there in history it didn't happen that
[1:32:11] way the angel Gabriel came to her
[1:32:14] hallelujah
[1:32:15] they'll be found with child by the Holy
[1:32:17] Ghost amen
[1:32:20] that's exactly how he's done at every
[1:32:23] age he's explained it away in the days
[1:32:25] of Noah he explained that it was
[1:32:27] impossible for it to rain from heaven
[1:32:29] it had never rained it had never rained
[1:32:32] in the days of Noah and he comes a man
[1:32:34] it's gonna rain the water's going to
[1:32:36] cover the world you're all gonna die
[1:32:38] unless you get in the boat I build
[1:32:40] oh that's very convenient we're gonna
[1:32:41] listen to you what's this thing you're
[1:32:44] peddling that you're the only one who
[1:32:46] has the message for the day he did we
[1:32:49] accept it because it's just history
[1:32:50] but what if Noah was standing here today
[1:32:52] God's gonna destroy this world because
[1:32:55] the wickedness of the people God's going
[1:32:57] to flood this world you're to get in
[1:33:00] this boat I'm building otherwise you get
[1:33:01] a drowned it's gonna rain and we'd say
[1:33:05] mr. Noah sir it's never rain before
[1:33:08] what's rain go read the scripture never
[1:33:10] rained can you explain to me how it's
[1:33:12] gonna rain and maybe he would have said
[1:33:14] God had told me well what do you mean
[1:33:18] God told you your voice is speaking to
[1:33:20] you gone crazy that other person said
[1:33:24] God told them things and he wouldn't
[1:33:25] shut some people how does it you know
[1:33:27] you can't just say God told God but God
[1:33:29] told him he built the ark people made
[1:33:32] fun of
[1:33:33] you're crazy this crazy but religion
[1:33:35] it's not an it's not in line with the
[1:33:38] current trend they were they were
[1:33:40] religious and they day they win a bunch
[1:33:42] of atheists they had their temples and
[1:33:44] their priests and their religions and
[1:33:45] their denomination whatever more and
[1:33:47] he's a man building it out with his
[1:33:49] three sons you know and people say no
[1:33:53] that can't be right because it's so
[1:33:55] small and whatever more no God put it
[1:33:58] there in front of everyone for a hundred
[1:34:00] and twenty years however long it took
[1:34:02] him to build it it was there and he was
[1:34:04] preaching it was the same and finally
[1:34:07] was built then the animals walk in we
[1:34:11] can do that it's been done before they
[1:34:14] explained it away why didn't other
[1:34:17] people get in and then the door closes
[1:34:20] and then it rains and it's too late
[1:34:25] because the devil explained it away
[1:34:29] how about man does not change it's not
[1:34:33] logical that it'll rain because
[1:34:35] scientifically it's never rained put out
[1:34:38] your rainmeter they do it baby you know
[1:34:40] look it's empty have we ever had rain
[1:34:43] records no think about it and you're
[1:34:47] telling me it's gonna rain where it's
[1:34:49] never rained before and that he had no
[1:34:52] proof the only proof he had as God told
[1:34:54] me amen and here we are in this day and
[1:34:59] people think we're crazy
[1:35:01] but God spoke his word is true this is
[1:35:05] not a history book it's become alive in
[1:35:07] this day right God's promised he
[1:35:10] fulfills his word by bringing it to pass
[1:35:12] we see his word being fulfilled he said
[1:35:14] this Malachi 4:2 turn our hearts back to
[1:35:17] the original faith Amen the greatest
[1:35:19] proof that this that Christianity this
[1:35:22] message is real is because of people
[1:35:24] being transformed and God dwells in them
[1:35:26] that is the vindication I want proof I'm
[1:35:30] the proof I used to be a rag sinner that
[1:35:33] was lost and undone and God transformed
[1:35:35] me I didn't go to a church people no one
[1:35:38] told me God told me
[1:35:42] the believers of indication right the
[1:35:45] believers of indication amen you want to
[1:35:49] see proof of the resurrection here's
[1:35:51] proof of the resurrection people have
[1:35:53] been raised from death to life that's
[1:35:55] the proof that Jesus came out of the
[1:35:57] tomb hallelujah amen
[1:36:01] now great scientific gospel that he
[1:36:06] preached in the Garden of Eden this is
[1:36:07] this is the sea serpent he could shoot
[1:36:10] the instruments to the moon and prove
[1:36:12] there's no moisture up there but God
[1:36:13] said they would come a rain but Satan
[1:36:16] succeeded and poison the mind of the
[1:36:19] people by scientific research that it
[1:36:21] could only not be done but it was done
[1:36:25] God said it would be done and it was
[1:36:27] done he did amen now the thing is you
[1:36:34] say well how do you and then another
[1:36:38] thing he can do the devil can do maybe
[1:36:41] just go back to this the the devil tries
[1:36:45] to wear us down I'm just going to go
[1:36:47] back two hours talking about the
[1:36:48] battlefield we have to we picked the
[1:36:52] battlefield now I know there's the
[1:36:54] battle on the mind right but how that
[1:36:57] battle plays out is actually up to us
[1:37:00] where you going the things you look at
[1:37:02] and the things you read will dictates
[1:37:05] what happens in here that's I know it's
[1:37:07] very simple but you know if you're if
[1:37:10] you're reading a bunch of atheistic
[1:37:13] stuff on the internet that will affect
[1:37:16] you it will it will sway you right it
[1:37:21] will and so now you're actually doing
[1:37:23] the enemy put some weapons in the
[1:37:25] battlefield against you right but now
[1:37:28] you can dictate because we are we're not
[1:37:33] robots any robots in here
[1:37:37] we're not message robots we're people
[1:37:41] and you have free moral choice but
[1:37:44] you're free roll choice should be but
[1:37:46] should be governed by your nature right
[1:37:48] if your nature is of the Lord then your
[1:37:51] choices will be towards him right but if
[1:37:53] you have an unconverted
[1:37:54] you'll go to the world because you're in
[1:37:57] line with the world but now I'm just
[1:38:00] reading here with Sampson because
[1:38:01] Sampson was worn down by Delilah
[1:38:05] there's just the last part of it and she
[1:38:08] said unto Him how canst thou say I love
[1:38:10] thee when thy heart is not with me thou
[1:38:13] has mocked me these three times and has
[1:38:16] not told me were in thy great strength
[1:38:19] lieth and it came to pass when she
[1:38:22] pressed him daily with her words and
[1:38:24] urged him so that his soul was vexed
[1:38:27] unto death then he told her all his
[1:38:29] heart and said unto her there have not
[1:38:32] come a razor upon my head for I have
[1:38:36] razor upon my head for I have been a
[1:38:39] Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb
[1:38:42] if I be shaven there my strength will go
[1:38:46] from me I'll become weak and be like any
[1:38:48] other man he so Sampson went to Delilah
[1:38:54] right he actually decided I'm going
[1:38:57] there so he opened himself up he opened
[1:39:01] himself up to the enemy's attack right
[1:39:03] he actually he yo Delilah then covered
[1:39:06] Israel he went into the fullest island
[1:39:08] and he opened himself up and then
[1:39:11] there's what happens this is the devil's
[1:39:12] slowly slowly works away slowly works
[1:39:16] away little by little if you let him
[1:39:19] he'll work at you he's got time right
[1:39:23] he'll slowly work at you and that's why
[1:39:25] you've got to say well why would you
[1:39:27] even expose you now you know I'm talking
[1:39:29] very genuinely about what you what do
[1:39:30] you think about it he ended up with a
[1:39:32] strength God right he gave he exposed
[1:39:37] all of his heart to his enemy who was
[1:39:39] actually paid to kill him or find the
[1:39:41] find the source and the thing that made
[1:39:44] him separate to God that gave him the
[1:39:46] strength he surrendered it because of
[1:39:49] the workings of the enemy now I'm
[1:39:51] talking very gingerly because it covers
[1:39:53] a lot of things in life but you got to
[1:39:55] be careful where the devil will work at
[1:39:57] you he'll work at you and he'll find the
[1:40:00] source of your strength and take it from
[1:40:02] you the source of our strength is not
[1:40:05] hid knowledge the source of our strength
[1:40:08] God and you Christ in you the hope of
[1:40:10] glory right but he will get you into a
[1:40:13] environment where that is basically cept
[1:40:16] out of you if he can we don't want to
[1:40:20] get that's why you can pick your
[1:40:21] battlefield we can't dictate what the
[1:40:24] world does but we can dictate how it
[1:40:28] affects us amen hey we don't live in
[1:40:32] China where where there's a big part of
[1:40:34] China well small part of China where
[1:40:36] it's predominately a Muslim population
[1:40:37] and recently every home in that province
[1:40:41] has a communist party member go live
[1:40:43] with them let's just happen because now
[1:40:45] they're going to be taught that the the
[1:40:48] ways of communism to try and get them
[1:40:51] because it's been what you don't know
[1:40:53] about the uprising you know that unrest
[1:40:56] in one region of China because it's
[1:40:57] predominantly Muslim so now the Chinese
[1:40:59] saying this is how we'll fix it will
[1:41:01] we'll see him party members to live with
[1:41:03] the people and they're gonna preach
[1:41:04] coming isn't to the people now we don't
[1:41:07] live that kind of yo but the world is
[1:41:11] quite invasive right the world is quite
[1:41:14] a razor
[1:41:14] they can't dictate yes we'll have them
[1:41:17] in our home or not they just there
[1:41:18] they'll live with them they have to
[1:41:20] accept them into their home but yet if
[1:41:25] we open the door
[1:41:27] right if we open the door then the enemy
[1:41:35] can't get a hold of us right
[1:41:39] what are we and it's the promise we live
[1:41:43] in a world of grey don't we the devil
[1:41:47] works in the gray so he works it's not
[1:41:50] just oh this is this is God and this is
[1:41:52] Satan no he's a big gray area and the
[1:41:56] Devils influenced every part of society
[1:41:58] right and we need rural Holy Ghost
[1:42:01] discernment is that God or is that Satan
[1:42:05] right we need to think about that will
[1:42:10] give me a give me an illustration minor
[1:42:12] book store or Christian Christian
[1:42:14] literature Christian music Christian
[1:42:16] movies where's the inspiration come from
[1:42:21] what life is the people projecting right
[1:42:24] he takes on the most famous artists
[1:42:27] today what life are they living what do
[1:42:30] they dress this what do they live that
[1:42:33] is their preaching a message and they
[1:42:36] are the embodiment of that message right
[1:42:39] they are the interpretation of what they
[1:42:41] believe your life is the interpretation
[1:42:43] of what you believe right so if you
[1:42:45] really believe the word your life will
[1:42:47] be interpretation of that word so you
[1:42:50] don't think about well ah but it's so
[1:42:51] wonderful of course it's so wonderful
[1:42:54] Satan is an entertainment they haven't
[1:42:57] so fine tuned the lights are at the
[1:42:58] right level the sounds of the right
[1:43:00] level the dancers are at the whatever
[1:43:02] more it's so choreographed the big
[1:43:04] lightshow of course it course it entices
[1:43:07] people I mean of course it does
[1:43:11] it's designed that way to keep people
[1:43:14] but then we don't want to let that
[1:43:17] influence us what's it doing to our
[1:43:19] thinking what's it doing to our walk you
[1:43:22] say but I feel so good don't let your
[1:43:25] emotions rub you because they get an
[1:43:28] emotional high you see people there
[1:43:30] they're crying they're screaming they're
[1:43:31] genuinely rejoicing but what do they
[1:43:34] worship ik amen now he sees this here
[1:43:43] and then we'll wind up what's the time
[1:43:47] early on Wednesday night we see some
[1:43:49] television program they all take off to
[1:43:51] the basement watch some television
[1:43:52] program and minister was telling me the
[1:43:54] other day he went to eat supper with a
[1:43:57] person and while they were getting
[1:43:59] supper really dismissed his wife had to
[1:44:01] go watch we love Suzy or something like
[1:44:03] that before she could even cook supper
[1:44:05] for them brother I'm telling you when it
[1:44:07] comes it shows that the home life no
[1:44:10] matter I no wonder we were juvenile
[1:44:12] deliquency
[1:44:13] know one of the secrets been discovered
[1:44:15] it's taken the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:18] out of the people and they are they are
[1:44:21] going for the things of the world and
[1:44:23] center for coming back to God stop look
[1:44:26] and listen the coming of the Lord is at
[1:44:27] hand
[1:44:28] what good is our knowledge do what good
[1:44:31] will our big buildings do what of our
[1:44:33] intellect will do
[1:44:35] amen it'll see what good will those
[1:44:38] things to see what you love is what
[1:44:42] you'll do right yeah yeah you see like
[1:44:46] people have traveled around the world to
[1:44:48] go to the World Cup and Russia they love
[1:44:50] soccer they save up they sacrifice and
[1:44:55] they go and they're looking forward to
[1:44:57] it because the spirit of the game is in
[1:44:59] them you don't have to drag them to the
[1:45:02] World Cup they don't have to be arrested
[1:45:04] and put on a plane and you - out watch
[1:45:06] this world cup no they and and they
[1:45:09] didn't you know and they gladly pay
[1:45:11] crazy amount of money for all the
[1:45:12] merchandise and everything paint
[1:45:14] themselves will crazy colours and dance
[1:45:16] around and whatever more you don't have
[1:45:17] to make them do it because the spirit of
[1:45:20] the game is in them right and it's the
[1:45:23] same thing with a believer if the Spirit
[1:45:27] of Christ is in you you love the Lord
[1:45:29] you worship Him you live for him
[1:45:31] you don't have to it's not a drudgery to
[1:45:33] come to church it's not a drudgery to
[1:45:36] read the word it's not a drudgery to
[1:45:38] pray it's a joy it's a wonderful thing
[1:45:41] because the sport of God is in you oh
[1:45:44] yeah so if you really see what spirit is
[1:45:47] in you by the life you live I mean and
[1:45:50] so we shouldn't be caught up you gotta
[1:45:52] watch what you're caught up with because
[1:45:55] you see what the Spirit in you is
[1:45:56] feeding on now resist the devil how do
[1:46:02] you resist the devil the same way our
[1:46:03] chief captain told us to do take the
[1:46:05] Word of God that's how you resist the
[1:46:07] devil by the Word of God the chief
[1:46:09] captain told us how it was done
[1:46:11] all right now I'm closing I want to say
[1:46:13] this that old devil now you think he is
[1:46:15] brazen you think he'll attack a child he
[1:46:18] will attack anything
[1:46:19] he attacked Jesus Christ he came at him
[1:46:22] with three world attacks did you know
[1:46:24] that Satan didn't just come with just
[1:46:27] one at sorry just only attack once he
[1:46:31] will attack you with a disease then here
[1:46:34] he'll come back a tech and say the days
[1:46:36] of miracles is past you can't get healed
[1:46:38] and nothing to do it you know that's
[1:46:41] right he's attacked Jesus three times
[1:46:43] three well the tax he run in on Jesus
[1:46:46] with
[1:46:47] unbelief in God's Word it is written
[1:46:49] Jesus says is written
[1:46:51] he's showing how to resist it is written
[1:46:53] right and he overcame him as attackers
[1:46:58] what disbelieve God's Word that's his
[1:47:01] attack there you can see the greatest
[1:47:04] battles ever fought there's only two
[1:47:06] forces Satan and God and what Satan's
[1:47:08] weapon against you is to try and get you
[1:47:10] to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you
[1:47:13] let's listen real quiet now listen if he
[1:47:17] can get you to disbelieve your weapon is
[1:47:20] equivalent if he can get you to believe
[1:47:23] that your weapon is not strong enough
[1:47:25] he's disarmed you right so if he thinks
[1:47:29] your weapon is equivalent Satan doesn't
[1:47:31] have a weapon have you ever actually
[1:47:33] looked in his armory all he has is
[1:47:35] deception and lies
[1:47:36] he's a slicker I mean he's a deceiver of
[1:47:39] man he doesn't have a weapon that's why
[1:47:41] in the first stage he rode forth with a
[1:47:43] bow and no arrows Here I am with my bow
[1:47:46] and he conquered by by deceit so if the
[1:47:52] devil can get you to believe that he is
[1:47:54] actually armed he's got you a man you
[1:47:59] got to call his hand call your bluff how
[1:48:01] many times you hit brother bury the
[1:48:02] prayer line Satan you're nothing but a
[1:48:04] bluff amen
[1:48:06] so now our brother never law hope you
[1:48:11] never disbelieve that look he just arms
[1:48:14] you when he gets you to disbelieve that
[1:48:15] weapon when you lay that down that
[1:48:18] finish your fight you're done hold that
[1:48:20] weapon don't lay it down amen
[1:48:23] that's why the devil comes long is this
[1:48:27] really true did it really happen
[1:48:30] is it really accurate I believe it is
[1:48:32] that's me I believe it works and it
[1:48:35] works I've seen it work right
[1:48:38] Allu you now for he the worse for what
[1:48:41] spurred serve for the reading bases
[1:48:44] Hebrews the worst for once purse has no
[1:48:46] more conscious of sin sin is passed from
[1:48:49] him I heard brother Neville saying this
[1:48:51] morning someone might have been asking
[1:48:52] him why didn't I preach on the Holy
[1:48:54] Ghost why'd I do this here it is the
[1:48:56] Holy Ghost is the action the Holy Ghost
[1:48:59] is the
[1:49:00] action and you it's a life not an
[1:49:02] emotion not some sort of fleshly
[1:49:04] evidence it but it is a person Jesus
[1:49:08] Christ the Word of God established in
[1:49:09] your heart to quicken every word of this
[1:49:12] age right right that's what the Holy
[1:49:15] Ghost is God and you to quicken the word
[1:49:17] I mean more than just the manifestation
[1:49:19] as I said people could be anointed but
[1:49:21] they be false anointed ones right Balaam
[1:49:24] Balaam was anointed as the Spirit of God
[1:49:26] came upon him and he prophesied and it's
[1:49:28] still coming to pass his prophecy but he
[1:49:30] was a false vessel right he was a false
[1:49:33] anointed one and so it's going to be
[1:49:35] more than just an anointing as I say
[1:49:37] what is the life that's lived out of you
[1:49:39] after the experience amen because of us
[1:49:43] just now I believe in being anointed
[1:49:44] I've spoken in tongues I've shouted I've
[1:49:48] been under the anointing walking around
[1:49:49] I felt like I was drunk I was no I did
[1:49:54] but but there's none of the prefer
[1:49:56] perverse side of being drunk I was drunk
[1:49:59] in the spirit all things like that but
[1:50:02] what life happens after what life is
[1:50:05] produced by their fruits what they do
[1:50:08] you shall know them amen so you got a
[1:50:13] look at that don't be deceived as he in
[1:50:18] you is he living now we know our Lord
[1:50:23] predicted such a time now this is um
[1:50:25] we'll just finish with this such a time
[1:50:28] to come there'd be unrest among nations
[1:50:31] perplexed of times distress between the
[1:50:33] nations and we have tried everything
[1:50:36] that's seemingly humanly possible to
[1:50:38] make it last just a little longer but I
[1:50:40] believe that we're just running out I
[1:50:42] don't believe that there's anything else
[1:50:45] that we could do about it if we just we
[1:50:48] just at the end of it we tried we tried
[1:50:52] for a while on having kings in there and
[1:50:55] that wouldn't work then they tried
[1:50:57] democracy it doesn't work and we've
[1:50:59] tried they've tried dictators it doesn't
[1:51:01] work and each one seemed just a little
[1:51:03] bit shallower each time and now we stand
[1:51:07] at the greatest moment when anything
[1:51:10] could happen it could be over in five
[1:51:13] minutes
[1:51:14] the greatest bone anything could happen
[1:51:17] sorry
[1:51:18] it could be over in five minutes time
[1:51:20] the every nation can be laid to powder
[1:51:23] and if we're just at that time we're
[1:51:26] ought the church to be a great crisis
[1:51:28] then also we have a home life crisis
[1:51:32] it seems the home life is running out
[1:51:34] into shallow water it used to be a home
[1:51:37] that the father the head of the house
[1:51:39] would sit down of a morning and he would
[1:51:42] speak with his family and they would
[1:51:44] each take out the old family Bible read
[1:51:48] and and read just a bit of it and that
[1:51:52] all gather around the table and have
[1:51:53] prayer you don't see that no more and
[1:51:56] when the day was done and my head the
[1:52:01] dishes washed that all gatherin and read
[1:52:03] some more of the Bible and pray before
[1:52:06] going to bed he says this is how home
[1:52:09] life used to be amen now what about
[1:52:13] today we have only 24 hours in the day
[1:52:18] right some of that time is asleep so we
[1:52:22] don't have 24 hours consciously awake
[1:52:24] now but there's a lot more distractions
[1:52:26] today you have to look it now you have
[1:52:30] to look what is you know I'm just gonna
[1:52:32] finish with us or what is the equation
[1:52:33] what is your goal in life what are you
[1:52:36] wanting to achieve what do you want if
[1:52:39] you just want a nice family you can have
[1:52:41] a nice family right but your ultimate
[1:52:44] goal should be God living right God
[1:52:48] living not just in church every moment
[1:52:51] of the day where he can take you and he
[1:52:55] could annoy you and speak to someone or
[1:52:57] a burden for prayer can come on your
[1:53:00] heart and you can pray through for that
[1:53:02] and you can find out later that that
[1:53:04] person was healed or someone was
[1:53:06] delivered or something like that right
[1:53:08] or the family comes and the devil tries
[1:53:11] to attach himself doesn't he someone
[1:53:15] comes in all upset you know something's
[1:53:17] going on and it's just the enemy trying
[1:53:19] to have a go and you can pray create an
[1:53:21] atmosphere and that thing is cast out I
[1:53:24] mean this
[1:53:26] this is what we have is it not does it
[1:53:28] not but what does our home life centered
[1:53:31] around you say yes I want God to live
[1:53:33] then you gotta say well Lord your well
[1:53:36] why do I need to be birthed into the
[1:53:38] kingdom right and the Holy Ghost feeds
[1:53:41] on the word amen and what do we there
[1:53:48] has to be it I just finished with this
[1:53:51] the token made the difference in our
[1:53:54] opening text right there has to be a
[1:53:58] token for the house as well for your
[1:54:00] house the Holy Ghost must be a token for
[1:54:03] your house that it becomes a place of
[1:54:04] sanctuary right without it the death
[1:54:07] angel will come in right but with it
[1:54:10] he'll stay away and that's the problem
[1:54:14] people can profess all kinds of things
[1:54:15] but without that life on display it
[1:54:18] doesn't do any good I mean so how about
[1:54:21] you is that Tok is God actually alive or
[1:54:25] is it just you know you're up and down
[1:54:27] in and out don't know what's true what's
[1:54:30] wrong who I am who God is
[1:54:32] you know are you going by someone else's
[1:54:34] experience or do you have your own well
[1:54:37] he became personal to you amen let's
[1:54:40] have the musicians please
[1:55:00] I mean let's stand I want to sing I want
[1:55:20] to sing we are we saying at the very
[1:55:21] beginning oh how I love Jesus
[1:55:29] they should sing that softly you say
[1:55:33] Lord I want you to live in me change me
[1:55:38] changed take everything out of my life
[1:55:40] that's country to your word that you can
[1:55:42] come and dwell in me right take all the
[1:55:45] religion out take anything he will
[1:55:47] identify it right you don't have to just
[1:55:50] put up with just religion you know God
[1:55:52] can come and dwell Amen there is
