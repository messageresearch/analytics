in Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean I just like to read a scripture that I want to share a little bit of of South Africa so let's just go to Matthew chapter 2 actually so not not not Matthew chapter 2 I'd like to go to Luke Luke chapter 1 and I want to read from from verse 67 this is about the birth of John the Baptist so Luke 1 and verse 66 and all they had heard them laid them up in their heart saying what manner of child shall this be speak of John the Baptist in the hand of the Lord was with him and as father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for his visited and redeemed his people has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy Covenant the oath which he sware to our father Abraham that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear and holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life and our child shall be called the prophet of the highest for the four thou shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace I mean may the Lord bless us would you may have your seats this morning sorry I don't I don't have any photos and videos on the on the projector because most of them are of of rhino's and and and things from the Krueger but I'll but I'll put that on the what set but you know South Africa it was a it was a wonderful time we we flew into Johannesburg and it was raining normally it's mid-thirties hot sunny we were promised would never see a cloud all we saw was cloud but it was very comfortable other so we so we were invited by the kid Ian Retief invited us for for the youth camp beer and and we had a wonderful time there at the camp it was just as Church there was so it was raining there was flooding never in like over 10 years does it normally normally there the rain only works half a day all yourself kids would know you know be clear blue sky and thunder clouds thunderstorms and pour down with rain and they would finish but it was just raining all day so they said we brought our weather with us and we kind of did but it was it was it was neat so so so there in Johannesburg we met brother Gideon's father brother Willie Retief and he was he he meet brother Branham there when brother Burman was there in nineteen in the early 1950s years here in the meetings in blue Fontaine and he saw because they had seen the supernatural power of God before but when they saw a man standing and and just and just see visions and discern people's hearts what was going on the ordinance I thought this is something different and so the anointing just come down and and and he said in 1965 he actually drove brother BAM to the airport spend some time with them and brother BAM saw that he was going to have a church and and he really started to duplicate the message and then spread it around and and but brother Willie said if people only were ever in that presence of God and he and he started crying telling us just how awesome that Prince of God came down when the angel Lord came into the into the room River was with a prophet that's it he said people would never turn against us if they really felt that presence and he was crying when this was over what 50 odd years ago wouldn't happen but it so impacted by the awesome power of God there and then we so so so we were there at the youth camp and and we saw old friends you know if anyone remembers brother Francois sister mana boys who were in Auckland we saw them which was wonderful yes yes so they seen their greetings and then we then we went to the Kreuger for three nights and that was fantastic that was lush and green because it had been raining but but the good thing about that is all the babies came yo yo were born and it was so we saw all the we saw lions we saw leopards we saw cheetahs we saw rhinos rhinos are very rare these days because of the I'm gonna speak a bit later about the world falling apart and this world has fallen apart you know the Kruger so it's a half the size of the North Island of New Zealand it's a reserve that's how big it is but it's small compared to the rest of South Africa the vastness of the country is amazing and but you know the so the Rhino you know people come and they they they they they kill them they cut the horn off and they get over a hundred thousand US per kg of horn that's just the guy who shoots the rider and cuts the horn off says big money and there's greed so they just go and they're just shooting them out of helicopters and and you know and see anyway but it was neat to see all the wildlife beautiful to see you we saw baboons we saw lions we saw you know whole pride alliance we saw vultures we saw Eagles we saw everything but well we'll put it on we saw wild dogs which are very rare in the park they're just running on the road we saw all kinds of things so elephants giraffes you name it but what videos and stuff on whatever you can see those things and and then we flew down to Cape Town where we where we were brother Dale Adams pre invited he's got a church there and his his his father was here in the meetings also brother branham and he saw you know I may get this mixed up but um it was either him or another and it was another pastor dear that the but both their fathers were there with you know the brother Brennan one of them when when brother brown came on stage see there's just a pillar of light he couldn't see the man it's just this light and and just God like we you know we were taken to - we're brother band preached in in Cape Town well one of the places and and and it's spoken about here and in the province in Africa book and this is outside by the Town Hall who knows Cape Town and over got a lot of surf Ganci who's okay who knows Cape Town so there's the Town Hall where Nelson Mandela he gave us four speech to the people when he came out of prison right next to us this hall called the drill hall that's now a library brother Brown preached at a priest in the drill hall and so brother Dale Adams was telling us so what they do in South Africa is they have open doors so basically they will they will go knock on people's doors she had the gospel with them and asked if they can have a meeting in their home and quite a few people say yes so what so one time they and it's just total strangers and they and then say go into this one house there's this old woman just kind of leaning against the wall kind of half asleep look like and then brother Dale Adams is preaching basically how you're you know there was a man sent from God whose name was John forerun the first coming of Christ and in this day God seen a man called William Branham to fall on the scene coming and then as soon as he said that name William Branham she perked up and said oh I know who that is and he's thinking in his mind oh she's just some old senile woman she doesn't know who this who this man is and and she said ya know I was in his meetings in 1950 I was there and so she's like and it's he says well tell us what happened now she's not a believer okay but but but you know he says well tell us what happened well I was out there so so he preached in the drill hall and and there were thousands of people we couldn't get into the place but we're outside and the big open area outside the drill hole big big big open area but they had loudspeakers playing you know what was going on and then there was preaching basically all day but but but none of it was brother Branham was like if if Bosworth and and you know different ones and then um but then she said but then in the evening we heard brother Brahm come and he said good evening friends and as soon as he said that the anointing just fell on the crowd pandemonium just broke out and it was just mass healings just happened throughout the whole crowd and they had to step over all the cots wheelchair stretchers he just said those two words good evening friends and the presence of God just fell on the congregation that's all recorded about in here thousands and thousands of people and and and she said people were just swaying under the anointing was so powerful God has visited this generation so yeah so you can read about it in here if you haven't read this book but it was amazing to see you know it was amazing to be in a place and hear those testimonies because sometimes we just think because the reason brother Brown he wasn't even actually allowed to preach when he went to South Africa in the 50s because they never considered him to be a preacher but he had some kind of deliverance ministry that's what they said so so the others preached but he just went up and prayed and when he did God just came down what's happening God was visiting his people and I wanted to say that just because you know we are that same one is with us today not the man you know it wasn't the man he says I'm just your brother but that God that Lord Jesus Christ that was with that prophet is with us today and he's the same God in the same way and you know it was a it was amazing it was and and and we saw sister shantel's Mormon and and stepdad they came to the service on Sunday morning you know the camp people really enjoyed it there was one there was one of the counselors he said had been here he was in his 30s I think and he was wrestling with something since he was 12 he said did God just gave him peace at the camp and there was others you know the Lord saw it so I was thankful you know it was but it was a wonderful time it was amazing to see where they are still a living witness with God had been and Godzillas there and Evi say well the proper neighbors have visited the shores but the same Lord Jesus has he's still alive today I mean so I'm still trying to recover from jet lag or something but it's I just want to speak about this morning how the world is falling apart but there's a uniting time going on now it's amazing when you know if you just look at nature you know over over and over in South Africa there's a whole ecosystem so there's the main predators all the way down the food chain all the native species are still there oh and but the thing is though all the habitats been lost so before there was any one really there it was one big game reserve from Kenya all the way down to South Africa's just you know the elephant's used to migrate so we went and saw brother Brian Jones who knows brother Brian Jones we went to my holoholo before him to Cape Town and it was that was a real blessing to to meet him and sister Jenny and so they didn't have any the only wild animal in their house was a goat then have any hyena or which they've had or hippos which have had or Rhino which they've had or lions which they've had didn't have those things but they just you know there's a pic goat there but you know we we got licked by a cheetah you know I've got some Eagles Lennon our arm and you know sort of black black leopard and it was it was quite amazing but you know he said you know when he was young because he helped reintroduce Rhino into the Kruger Park because by that stage they had been killed out and he was told when when he was young he said I'm someone told him that the Kruger National Park is a white elephant so basically it's useless and and he didn't believe it but now he sees it as because you know all the animals can't migrate to where they weren't so elephant used to migrate from Sarah all the way up to Kenya and BEC used to be one big but but but now they can't and because there's the poaching going on and many times actually the Park Rangers are in with the poachers there's all these inside jobs going on and so the whole place even even around them cause there's lots of game game farms so in in Kiwi terms a set of farming sheep and cattle they've got lions and they've got big bucks and different things than you know people go shoot them you know like even around them a whole bunch of lines would just be massacred people go and just shoot them take their skins and so on so but but so he was telling us that you know Africa's dying because the ecosystem has fallen apart and it used to be also even over there that Agriculture's being pushed through lots of because we were driving with with brother Gideon and sister Kathy his wife and and because they go to the park quite often and they say every time they go more and more land has been turned into orchards and what's happening now is because people are growing more more fruit and vegies but it's it's destroying the natural habitat where beforehand it would just be native bush well not what we call bush but then what what they call bush and the cattle used to just Roman forage and they would just have their cattle farms basically the cattle would just wild and that would just bring them in yourself and kill them and so on but because they've taken out all of the natural land and put in fruit and vegies it's actually destroyed the habitat of everything so you know the places has fallen apart but see in New Zealand here we we don't have a full ecosystem we even have one for over 200 years because our our mainland not animal but bird the mole is gone so it's one part of the chains falling apart the Eagle that hunted that is gone so our ecosystem is already broken and it cannot be restored because you can't bring those things back from extinction so our world naturally is already fallen apart you know so if you take one part of the chain out it's gone now that's just in the natural how much more in the spiritual side so now if we read this so yeah so if you could remember brother Bryan and sister Jenny and prayer because they want to retire he's what is he 78 he's 78 and he's still running the place and is a actually a Swiss guy who who's there and in he says he wants to take over but he needs permanent residency so he asked for prayer that that this man marshal would get permanent residency that brother Bryan can retire because he wants to retire he's tired his arms so so this is big ant ant hill out by where the lion cages were and brother Bryan says put your finger in this hole so I put this finger in this anthill of to moment thing and they sing just bite me all these little babies and they just let jaw and they don't let go and he says he says these things I like like nature's um stitches he says you get cuts in the bush you get you find the adults you like pin them to and they just clamp on and you pull the body off of the thing just holds on and actually hold your flesh together his arms of scars you want to see scars it's just scars from from everything that he's done but you know it's yeah so now if we go to Psalms chapter 86 yeah but it was it was quite neat you know because my dad is from Cape Town so it was quite neat too you know and last time I was there I was seven so it's quite neat to go back and see the place you know see yeah you know see where you're from people were but you know but we'll did what I said actually I'm South African but I'm Kiwi so basically people like well what are you I thought well I'm from heaven that's all I know so what are you undercover South African and a Kiwi buddy well I don't know you know I'm something but you know when you find out who you'll hear who your father really is you you know that God is your father that that changes the whole world they mean to some 86 and read from verse one bow down lie near o Lord hear me for I am poor and needy preserve my soul for I am holy Oh thou my god save thy servant that trusteth and they be merciful unto me O Lord for I cry unto thee daily rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul for the our Lord art good and Reed to forgive in plenteous and mercy and to all them that call upon thee give ear o Lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications in the day of my trouble will I call upon thee for thou will answer thee I mean answer me among the gods there is none like unto thee O Lord neither are there any words of works like unto thy works all nations whom thou has made has thou has made shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shalt glorify thy name for thou art great indorse wondrous things thou our God alone teach me thy way O God O Lord I will walk in my truth unite my heart to fear thy name I will praise thee O Lord my God with all my heart I will glorify thy name for evermore for great as thy mercy towards me for thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell Oh God the proud arisen against me in the Assemblies of the violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them but thou are a god full of compassion and gracious long-suffering and plenteous and mercy and truth I turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thy handmaid show me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because our Lord hath Hope 'land me and comforted me amen so as I see it I want to speak about so the world is falling apart but there's also a uniting time now we know as I see justjust speaking very briefly about nature nature has fallen apart you know there is big studies you know you know I work for ESR and there's a division there at ESR and they're looking at microplastics and in drinking water it's everywhere and it's not just microplastics but even nano plastics because the Sun sunlight breaks down a little plastics it's in the food chain it's in it's in our drinking water you know they've done studies that even even bottled water I'll cover the brand not that the brand matters but there is plastic and the water you drink it's everywhere why cuz the world has fallen apart and we can't do anything about it you know there's a thing today called climate anxiety who's heard of that to him young people are anxious about the climate because climate change you know people are trouble this this distress there's worry there's yo all kinds of because the world is falling apart and we can't change it because it's not the political will even man's even desire to to actually forsake everything and actually change the place because of greed because we're the money in it so Nature has fallen apart the this country is nature's falling apart it can't be restored Africa's falling apart Asia is falling apart every place under heaven the world has fallen apart speaking of nature and unfortunately we we cannot change it at all button and then even even countries are falling apart and we know if you just read the news that you know there is gonna be a world war coming there is coming one Russia and a uniting to destroy the West and we know it will happen you know it's just so thankfully going to dentistry though praise the Lord God bless you amen that was that was a highlight we know heard that through so but I may be painting a bleak picture but at the same time it's not bleak cuz even at a time when the world was falling apart God is uniting himself with his bride to take us to a wedding supper in the sky so now in the first and the you know in the first coming of Christ there was a uniting going to gear now if we go to Luke chapter 24 I just want to I believe it's in Luke chapter 24 sorry Luke Luke chapter 23 there was a uniting of of different powers together that they were never friends before until the Lord came so Luke chapter 23 verses 11 and and 12 so this is where so Jesus has already been taken before Pilate you know he's he's had his first part of his trial then Jesus is sent to hear it because Jesus is from Galilee and here it is in charge of Galilee and it says so if we're reading Luke 23 and 11 and 12 and here it with his men of war set him at naught this is Jesus and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate and the same day Pilate and Herod were my friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves so they used to be hostility between them but because of Jesus they became friends so they had nothing in common until there was a crucifixion of the word and so it actually brought so so these are the scribes and Pharisees they United with Rome to use the Roman government to crucify the Lord Jesus Christ so that brought them together and then Pilate trying to decide what to do with Jesus brought Pilate and here to give us there's a uniting of actually the powers of darkness when the word was made manifested so there was a uniting time these these powers came together and then you can even see the same thing today that Russia and communism is coming together to destroy the West to destroy the world right brother Bram says and and the absolute 1962 he sees communism will burn Rome see you watch it it's at all in God's hand they think they're against God they're working right into it all the time don't know it he's using them as a puppet some tall in his hand like he did Nebuchadnezzar and many others so God used Nebuchadnezzar to bring judgment upon Israel it was at all in his hand just like communism and Russia or at all in God's hand to bring judgment against the church world that rejected Jesus Christ on this day against the West amen this is I mean this is this is world events right so so there was a uniting of these different powers when when when the Lord was rejected at his first coming now so the church and that day use political power of Rome to kill him so they united with throw him and even though Pilate tried to wash his hands to get Jesus blood off of his hands he consented to the crucifixion so the uniting of those powers and then so this was all done that that the prophecy that the Lord said that that not one stone of the temple will remain atop of each other that Jerusalem's going to be destroyed that all had to happen so so the church world rejected the Messiah and that day which actually brought the judgment of God upon it by using the Roman armies and so we know an ad 70 that the Roman general Titus besieged Jerusalem and burnt it and massacred the people and when so so in those days with the Romans they used to give them I was like olive leaves wrapped around and like in a crown called a laurel and Titus as recorded said he he did not accept that laurel because he said no he was just a tool of God's divine judgment upon the Jews he knew what he was doing so but then what we have is so there was so but between the crucifixion of the Lord and the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 there was a book of Acts written and so in that time now there was a uniting of a people with the Lord it's what we're actually living out as brother am said is that there will be another book of Acts written in the stay now when we think of a book of Acts we think normally healing signs and wonders now that is part of the book of Acts but that book of Acts now is he's actually saying as the book of Acts was a pattern and so now if that is the pattern and it's going to be rewritten it will follow the same pattern that was that that we read about so there was a true Pentecost God came and dwelt in us and his people and and in the word went out and churches were birth ministries will form people came to the Lord as as as the word was spread so there was a uniting time even during this time when a when when judgment was now laying over Jerusalem and it was going to be destroyed so the church world was going to be destroyed by this Roman power and we're living in the same day history is repeating itself now he sees here see the thing is though way I'll find it see now notice so so so this is brother brand speaking and uniting time and sign he sees no notice he pointed out National Science ring of Jesus when they asked him about this they wanted signs they he um he gave them signs what happened they wanted to know when would be the end of the world when would be the sign of the end he pointed them out many signs through the scriptures about national science about perming heavenly sign in the heavens and earthly sign he gave them signs signs just a constant sign and he told them they've been there be in one place about a national sign when you see the nation's gather around as I'm gathered around Jerusalem see when we know that the time of their troubles at hand when you see Jerusalem compassed about with armies this is from Matthew 23 he's he's referring to now before they could do the see the world had to unite Titus this great Roman general had to unite his armies together and come around after these Jews had rejected the god-given sign of the time to them that's the time that Titus United his armies together to come and take the city first they had to be uniting of God's people so called against the Word of God before the nation could unite itself against God's people see the unity the uniting uniting together I believe we're living in a great uniting time I'm taking I'm taking these red lights down and flesh signals of everything of of the woman how they do the men how they do the churches how they do showing through this little group with all my heart I believe we're look we are lining in the line of God's Word of this great prophetic hour just before the coming of the Lord Jesus uniting together and getting ready so now you see before Titus you United the nations of his armies together Israel United themselves together and banded themselves that they would not believe Jesus to be the Messiah they rejected him and turned him out and crucified him and then when they rejected the salvation that was sent to them they United themselves together to do it now hold that in mind uniting themselves together to reject the message of the hour they had to do that and when they did that then that national scientist that judgment upon the nation and then now he speaks of today the uniting together putting their powers together the free world they're putting its power together the communism is putting their power together with Russia everybody but each one's scared of one another see it's a fearful sign that's right it's national signs and things and you see what's happening today China and Russia communism is coming together the West you know the free world is trying to come together way it's gonna be a war it's gonna be a battle of Armageddon as prophesied is going to happen and we're seeing it actually it it's been on its road for a long time I mean we shouldn't be surprised when we see the world as a lining houses it has to align this way it's God's Word being fulfilled I mean but but in this darkness of chaos I mean there is a people as I said remember Titus destroyed Jerusalem that's like the Battle of Armageddon that's when that's when the judgment that they you know that was hanging over the city fell but in the between time the word went out people were united with the living Lord Jesus amen so now that's why we're living in this time so you can see if you read through the book of Acts now you can actually see that everything you see around you and and Christendom has actually already been lived out before I mean so we should be able to see like you know for example you know there are some people which so if we reach dick and Timothy and it season chapter 2 and 17 and their word will eat as death a canker which is of Jaime Gnaeus and philetus who concerning the truth of Earth saying that the resurrections passed already and overthrow the faith of some so people say that we're already in the Millennium already in new bodies you know these things have already happened which they do and they overthrow the faith of some so people are actually trying to say that things have already happened when they haven't happened yet people over spiritualize events there's going to be a real body change that did in Christ are literally gonna rise there's going to be a millennium where we were going to live rule and reign for a thousand years holy it's literally going to happen there is going to be a literal translation of the living Saints right you can't spiritual you can't over spiritualize these things but people come around and they and they say know what brother Holmes said it's all been fulfilled well hold on no it hasn't cuz they're still in these bodies so you see that happen you know you can go to the Corinthian church you can see the Corinthian church has has has risen up people are liberal you know there's no you know you know what did the Corinthians do they condone sin and them it's how that man was was was living with his mother-in-law you know there was this blatant sin and sin among them but they weren't willing to to deal with it and and the believers in the Corinthian church are all Colonel I'm of polis I'm of klaris I'm of Christ I'm of Paul what they what they doing they were gathering around ministries that were there and some were just of Christ what's that I just listened to tapes I don't go to church all that's being lived out again today you can see it all and so that and that was happening in the window between the day of Pentecost and the destruction of Jerusalem why because a book of Acts is being repeated and you see it's what happens when people within a church they gather around different ministries you know I'm of this one arrived do you know what's happening they say it's actually carnality coming in instead of people receiving a ministry as it should be I mean because if because if you receive a ministry the right way then you'll be a benefit to the local body and you won't go there and well I like how this person preaches I like how this person does this no that's actually carnality gathering around the gift right so so we see that today do we not you know and and then you can see unfortunately today people gather around specialty doctrines they gather around a man and that thing falls apart because it has to fall apart and then people are wondering what's going on what is it because they've made a camp within the message and they've actually and it has to come to naught the man of the hour is the Holy Ghost I mean the Holy Ghost in the word is the man of the hour amen when God comes and manifests this message that is the man of the hour Amen you know we even see the Ephesians in this day the Ephesians they were taught very deep things but then but then Paul had to come and remind them husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church so he's actually had to tell them what you've been taught actually has an everyday application you're actually missing everyday life you're so caught up in these deep things of God you're actually missing that what you've been taught actually should live out your in your everyday life and they were actually missing that the revelations they have received actually had a practical application and that their everyday life had actually a greater meaning than they realized I mean we can you know we can read that in Ephesians love your wife as Christ loved the church it says husband wives love love your husbands I mean you know so he's saying that how you treat each other is actually a reflection of a greater marriage they meant but they seem to obviously why do Paul have to remind them of these things obviously they forgot I mean that what they learned or what they had received actually lived in everyday life they meant so the Galatians the Galatians we know they they they tried to bring keeping of the law and to being a Christian and and we know the Galatians there wasn't just one churches a group of churches so they'll bring the light of a former age and to what they believe now and we can see the same thing today where people try to bring a Methodist idea of sanctification and to enter the message now what do you mean by that well the Methodists had a method of biblical holiness so they had a physical human method of living a holy life that's why they're called Methodists right but real sanctification is when God comes in and cleanses you out how lujah he is the one he is the Sanctifier he is the cleanser of the church amen but then people try and bring in legalism and different things you know because you know brother Brahim said that the Pentecostals were good legalists so they're trying to bring the light of a former agent to the word today just like the Galatians did we see history is repeating itself amen and then we can go even into the Thessalonians where where where Paul says them don't be troubled by literal by spirit or by word saying the day of the Lord Uros at hand so this things that would come and they were troubled by things in it that had come in among them he saying don't be troubled by these things I've been sick in Thessalonians if you're wondering you know this is another day the Lord will not be until that son of perdition is revealed this is don't be troubled by these things don't worry about these things right so we can see the Thessalonians are here again today as well amen yo so so you go you can read through the book of Acts you can take the letters that are written in that span you can say history is repeated itself but even through all of that there was a people that were united with Christ there was a real uniting going on hallelujah now when is he uniting with with with God and as people it should produce something among us right it's more than just saying oh we United them and we're one with the Lord and we're Christians no it should produce a life I mean that it's more than just actually something we say but it's something that's lived out of us automatically hallelujah so so he sees here in this is a uniting time and sowing but God has received I mean but the church has received a heavenly sign an astronaut Amen Jesus Christ in the form of a pillar of fire that he was in the Old Testament and he was that he was when he met Saul on the road to Damascus down the same Jesus here today and what does it do does it bring fear it brings love a uniting of one another aiming a feeling for one another it brings the love of God o you not brings us the body of Christ into unity as a bride that's what is doing now this great union they're uniting themselves one group here to fight the other one one group over here to fight the other one here the church is standing between them you watch what happens it will unite with them that's exactly right but now we that we find out that brings fear and frustrations what happens when people raise up camps within within the message brings fear of lacerations and and and secretary anism you know but we're when perming but when way but the the the church the bride is united by one god - once per the Sprint God and one holy union of God to be one holy bride to God that's right all together unity of the body the body waiting as a bride as it is the bride as we call ourselves a bride for the uniting time of the bride the church is also coming together it should create just a love among us that we can hardly be away from one another what's happening okay something's have I broken something huh okay we'll do this now so you know okay we're unplugged so it should create such a love among us that we could hardly be away from one another that's right just you just you don't have to big people to pray you don't have to big him to worship God you don't have to big him to do what's right they just saw in love with him till there's nothing else oh you know brother Brad went into a house and there was you know so so he was just talking to a minister about how this minister said he can't you know he you know he scenes out plea just to all those congregation will you come to Sunday school for even a couple of Sundays or you know a year and and and he just got a few back but then there was this girl into this you know in this house where brother Bram had gone to click the power money and then she was dancing around listening to to some music and then and then she you know turns at offices you know I'll see you later whoever it what and then and then so he he relayed this to this minister and said you know what about this little girl listening to this music do you have to beg her to listen to it no because the spirit of that music is now in her and she loves it I mean it's it's the same thing with the Lord when the Holy Ghost comes into you you love it I mean it will be wonderful will be it'll mean everything to you in the world why because you become United hallelujah with the Word of God I mean so you don't have to beg them to worship you don't have to beg them to do what's right they just saw in love with him till there's nothing else hallelujah amen he says he says for lucky that the the uniting time is at hand for God is getting the church to give it for a rapture to go to the wedding for the great Union when God and man will unite fraternity when creatures have time unite with the eternal it was just once done in the form of the son of men on earth and he had to give his life to bring about a power to unite other men with the same power for the bride of Jesus Christ and now the church is uniting itself to the body of Christ it's got itself free cut away from every little feeder getting itself ready getting together Union among them Oh a love and a joy and the Holy Spirit moving among them oh my what a time and we can look even for the you know you go back the last 10 years - now there's such a unity among the Bride of Christ I meant you see even in this country used to be fighting infections and division and this one's not talking to this one that's fighting this one but now it's different well it's happening there's a love among the people there's a uniting time why because as the bride is coming to you on earth it's ruh it is showing how the bride and Christ are becoming one why because we're uniting around the Word of God we're putting aside our differences and partial understanding and saying Lord just come living us change our lives manifest your word holy that's more than just quoting quotes and quoting scripture but now the life of the word comes into the people and manifests himself through them hallelujah why there's the Uniting time going on amen hallelujah I'm so thankful about that say well this so that's Christmas you know here we are on this Christmas there are three wise men they were looking for a star and they were so united with the promise of God and that day that when they saw the light no one else saw the light they see we have seen a star in the East who have come to worship Him and they were so united with the promise of God till they saw the manifestation of that promise and they followed that star all the way to where the Christ was hallelujah so so they weren't satisfied and just seeing the sign they follow that sign all the way to where Christ was hallelujah and so no one else saw it because they weren't united with the word now brother Brown would say and that same message isn't it strange that these stars are exactly in line for three men that nobody else saw it at past over other observatories but they didn't see it just exactly in line now you can be so in line with the scripture see when those stars become an unity United themselves together in this constellation three men was also United at the same time and you can be so United with God in his word until these things become realities amen and you can see them and know that they are true hallelujah who wants to be like that see the sign of the time you might look right over the top and say all nonsense but to you it isn't nonsense to you your United with the word and here it is then it's absolutely light for the pet and when you see this sign unite with the believer and that's who I'm addressing this to as the believer for the unbeliever never see it and what a rebuke it would be if he was on earth today and to many of our clergy today who cannot read the sign the signs that we're reading daily here at the tabernacle and seeing the things and the others are reading it and seeing the handwriting on the wall and yet many just ignore it and don't even see it at all it's nothing to them at all they don't notice it I mean but those three men noticed it and they followed that star until finally they came to where the Christ was holy is the same thing with the shepherds I mean lowly shepherds sitting on the hills of you know Bethlehem there that angel came to them you'll find Christ in a manger and all true angels will lead you to where Christ does the work and that's why we have the seventh angel messenger an angel came to us hallelujah the unlikely of the earth like the Shepherd's run likely in their day and and as that angel said you'll find him laying in a manger I mean so a messenger has come in this day saying you'll find him in the word hallelujah and then we go find them we meet him he becomes a reality to us and then we have a testimony the angels message is true because I met the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so it's a time of uniting going on the bride in Christ are becoming one hallelujah and we know that you know we are that the Christians did not get caught up when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in that day because the Lord Jesus warn them when you see armies can pass about drew flea pray that the you know you know that it's not a winter on the Sabbath day I mean but but but flee to the mountains and and history shows that Titus came against the city three times the first two times he had to lift the siege and and and deal without the other enemies so the first time Titus came in then the believers recognized this is what our Lord told us and they fled when Titus lift the siege but by the third time amen all the Christians were gone and and Titus just massacred everyone in the city burnt it to the ground I mean sold them and your into slavery those who weren't killed it was just a massacre but none of the believers were caught up in that destruction and it's the same thing today none of the true believers will be caught up in the destruction of the world none of us will be here hallelujah during the time of Great Tribulation because we've we've we've heard the voice of God on this day saying when you see when you see armies when you see nations unite together when you see everything coming to buses come into position as we have hey one man could just push a bomb and we're gone I mean the whole world is fighting jockeying for position I think I think in this country our problem as we have it too easy life no and I appreciate we're in the first world but we shouldn't take for granted what we have that's what I mean by having it too easy we should treasure what we have in this country amen we should appreciate the freedom of religion we should appreciate the you know we always have the power going we always have running water where is there food you know we should appreciate those things never take it for granted amen now so we're living in a uniting season you say well I've probably said this before this could be the last Christmas we're here you say well you've said that probably every year I don't know probably have but the thing is for someone this is the last Christmas they'll ever see remember the world you say well we're at the end time well for someone the world has ended right for someone this is the end of all things why because they because people die you know according to ecology common and I'm just going to finish with this statement according to ecology calm as of 2011 50 5.3 million people die each year that's about the population area of South Africa nearly so as of 2011 effect status hundreds inaccurate as of 2011 this past year was the end of the world for 50 5.3 million people because they died it was there in time it was their last Christmas you know and we we we don't have the assurance we'll be here next year you know people have all kinds of plans but then they can never fulfill those plans because something happens to them and they're gone so what about us you say I've got my whole life in front of me you know I've looked I have outlived many 18-year old people already you know people are young they have their ambitions plans but then something happens so what are we really wanting this Christmas you know do we want you know what this could be our last Christmas here so I would encourage you this this Christmas why don't you unite with the Lord met him unites himself with you you're not my heart that I will amen shouldn't that be shouldn't that be what of what we want because if we died but your heart is United with him then what does it matter we've won anyway amen you know cuz life does not consist of the things that you have Jesus said life does not consist of the things you possess it doesn't matter the material things we have that's not life Jesus is that is not the substance of life that's just things around you but that's not actually what life consists of but the problem is we view our lives of being the quality of our life is based on what we possess but that's not quality of life at all because people can have the whole world and they can be on drugs they can be stressed they can be worried they can be broken lives completely why because the life their life does not consist of what they own that's the same thing with us you know you know this time of year people looking what can I give Christmas and what can I get and you know one of my so so they're looking of things that that they will receive that will actually prove to them will show them as it being a good Christmas or not because they're looking of things things that they now own will actually give them happiness but we have to come to an understanding the things we own will not give us happiness they will not give us happiness so I just ask you for fifty five point three million people this was their last Christmas or the last Christmas was their last there in their world ended they actually came to an end time we know this world will come to an end time but individually people are coming to an end time so what about us why don't you receive the real Christmas present of eternal life why don't you surrender your life to Him not have a religion this is not about a religion this message is not a religion it's not a way to live it's not that it's eternal life this is not something to argue about or this is eternal life so I'll just ask you why not now because that's all because when you know a thing as brother Isaac said you meet him you've won and it doesn't matter what happens in life he will see you through I mean it's just bow he's in a word of prayer shall we if anyone but want to be remembered of we just want to raise your hand a few if you so desire they said Lord Jesus you see the hands that are raised and I just asked father you just take these people chopped up words Lord and by your Holy Spirit may you put it all in the right order Lord we are living in a uniting time Lord as the world is uniting itself around different powers and ideologies Lord and there's trade wars there's a cold war going on there's an arms race Lord there's weapons now in existence that have no defenses against them Lord there's great movement of people because of strife and conflict and war and lore this world is truly falling apart and Lord we know just because we're here and the in the back end of the world here Lord the last Lord Jesus Lord we are we are on the last bus stop you could say on the road Lord Jesus where we're right here in the corner of the Pacific Lord we know we're not exempt from from the troubles that are in the world dear God but I just pray father as as as I just briefly spoken about these things Lord may we look up and know our redemption is near dear Lord Jesus I pray father that our hearts would be our lives would be united with you with your word dear God and we know that now in our own human ability we cannot do it Lord Jesus we can't be Christians and our own ability Lord Manners has tried for two thousand years - - to try and Lord Jesus to try and be Christians in their own strength dear God that's why people have written up rules and Articles of Faith and and and different churches have arisen but Lord we know it's it's it's nothing we can do Lord in our own strength Lord but it's it's only as full complete surrender into your hands Lord it's a death to self Lord it's a law it's a truly Lord or not a real repentance Lord a lot of turning 180 degrees and saying Lord take my life and make it vine and might not be our desires or anything we want My Lord but maybe your life your desires your word Lord so father I just pray dear God for for each one here Lord I just asked their God that our hearts would be united to you Lord that we would Lord as this uniting time of of nations and ideologies as is going on that we know also there's a uniting time of a people in your word Lord is the bride Lord and you being United together father and lord I just pray that we would all be part of that number dear God may he become so real to each and every one of us Lord may we may we not sit back and say well God's gotta show me but Lord may our hearts be Lord I'm coming Lord Jesus Here I am take my life make it thine Lord I want to become one with you Lord and I pray father law that truly would with such Lord hunger and thirst after righteousness until we're filled their God may you grant it Lord each and every one of us Lord that are not sealed into your kingdom Lord may put such a hunger and thirst dear Lord a deep calling to the deplored ammo we just surrender to that thirst that hunger and say Here I am Lord changes completely dear God and father all of us here that have met you Lord may we just be full of joy full of rest Lord full of Thanksgiving Lord Jesus Lord that you've caused us to be united with yourself Lord we weren't looking for you Lord I doubt very much those Shepherds we're looking for you law than the Lord when the angels came and sung the First Noel did it clear that the Christ the Lord is upon the earth well they weren't looking for you but Lord you sent your angels to them dear Lord they found you in a manger Lord Jesus and lord I want to thank you lord i lord none of us we're looking for you but you sent your angel my god lord we found you in your word to be alive lord or not just to look at one time and go away but lord to become one with that you come loving us dear God so father I pray you bless each one here dear God and just may you move on our hearts a little like never before we thank you for this holiday season but Lord may we never ever forget the reason for this season my lord Lord you're not tinsel on the tree Lord you're the manifest in Lord Jesus Christ it has come to impart eternal life in these dying hours of the world Lord so I pray your blessings upon each one Lord media every need and our much dear God Father in Jesus Christ's name Amen what a wonderful thing it is to be united with the Lord there's a there's a spot on each person you know that just that that nothing else will satisfy but when the Lord comes in it's there's peace you know this there's no more there's no more searching anymore there's no more want for anything when Christ really comes into our heart we have peace and when and the more we unite with them in every area of our life the better our life becomes he's the lover of our soul amen let's understand this morning it's the last service we have before Christmas so I'm gonna do maybe two or three Christmas carols is that Alright I know it's not the evening you know you you just think I'm in the evening with the candle lights

that and say well you're gonna be in a petrol station and you hear you can hear the name of the Lord I think it's the only time of year where you can actually wear for a brief moment of time you can
