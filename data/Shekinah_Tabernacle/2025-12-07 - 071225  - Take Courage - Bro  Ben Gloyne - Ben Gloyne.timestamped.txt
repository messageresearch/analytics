[2:25] Oh,
[2:29] [music]
[2:33] down.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:58] [music]
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[3:13] Welcome to the house of God this
[3:15] morning. It's good to see you all.
[3:20] As I was hopping up here, I couldn't
[3:22] help but notice my
[3:25] favorite
[3:27] youngest daughter laughing.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[3:34] &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself
[3:38] when we were growing when when the
[3:39] children were growing up, we would
[3:42] always bring the King Jame read the King
[3:43] James Bible and and Shannon would like
[3:46] the commandments were word for word what
[3:48] was in the King James Bible. So the
[3:51] children if if someone got in trouble,
[3:54] the other children weren't allowed to
[3:56] laugh cuz you were laughing at their
[3:57] calamity.
[3:59] So you got in trouble if you laughed at
[4:02] someone else's calamity.
[4:04] So someone would do something and the
[4:06] other person would laugh and then David
[4:08] would say, "Oh, mom, Hannah's laughing
[4:09] at my calamity."
[4:14] I'm going to announce to you that that
[4:15] rule no longer applies in our household.
[4:19] [laughter]
[4:20] People laugh at my calamity on a daily
[4:22] basis. So I think that I think when they
[4:25] all the children turned 10 that rule
[4:27] must have gone out the window somewhere.
[4:28] It went out the window cuz it does not
[4:29] apply anymore. Trust me.
[4:33] [music] Let's stand this morning.
[4:39] I'm glad we can serve the Lord this
[4:40] morning. I'm glad we can be in his in
[4:42] his presence. And let's just let's just
[4:43] pray.
[4:46] Lord, we thank you, Lord, that you
[4:48] you're here with us this morning, Lord.
[4:49] where two or three gathered in your name
[4:51] there you are in the midst
[4:53] Lord and we thank you Lord that um
[4:57] no matter what we go through through in
[4:58] life Lord you don't sit back and laugh
[5:00] Lord but you care you love us Lord and
[5:02] and you only want the best for us Lord
[5:04] so we just want to pray you'd meet us
[5:06] this morning in a powerful way thank you
[5:08] for your presence already amongst us I
[5:11] know that each one here has a pure heart
[5:14] and they're chosen and predestinated
[5:17] before the foundation of the world and
[5:19] each one is here Lord to to live out to
[5:22] be who they who we really are. Many of
[5:25] us in times past we were living
[5:27] different lives not this life. I'm even
[5:30] reminded of Saul in the Bible. He was
[5:31] living living a very different life for
[5:34] a while there than who he actually was.
[5:36] But Lord at some point you came and you
[5:38] met him Lord and his his life changed
[5:40] and he be and then he started to live
[5:41] out what he really was from from even
[5:44] before he was born. He was destined to
[5:45] [music] be to be a believer, to be a a
[5:48] son of God, to be called according to
[5:50] your purpose. And that that's each one
[5:53] here, Lord. I'm declaring that that's
[5:55] each person here that
[5:57] no matter what stage of the journey
[5:58] we're at, you have a perfect image of
[6:00] us, Lord, that and that we are coming
[6:02] into that,
[6:04] Lord. We're not that this is not just a
[6:05] routine that we do, but there's a
[6:07] there's a powerful supernatural work
[6:08] going on in our midst. and you're
[6:10] changing every person to become more
[6:13] like the person that you saw in your
[6:15] mind before the foundation of the world,
[6:18] Lord. So, I just want to pray for each
[6:19] one here this morning. May you bless
[6:20] each one, bless our fellowship, bless
[6:21] our worship, and we just want to invite
[6:23] you into our presence, Lord, to [music]
[6:24] to sing praises and to worship you this
[6:26] morning. So, we just um commit ourselves
[6:28] to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise
[6:30] the Lord. The steps of a good man are
[6:32] ordered by the Lord. Amen. For the steps

[34:27] announcement. Um so brother blessings
[34:30] ask that everyone who's in part of the
[34:32] um helping set up for the wedding venue
[34:35] and everything um for the wedding on um
[34:38] Saturday um we're going to go view the
[34:41] wedding uh the venue at 1:00 p.m. after
[34:43] church. So any everyone here who's part

[34:48] land, see how everything's going to go,
[34:50] we're going to go there at 1:00 and see.
[34:51] But we're super excited, but we're not
[34:54] as excited as you're as excited. But
[34:56] yeah, praise the Lord, we're excited
[34:57] with you. So, I believe it's going to be
[34:58] a wonderful weekend next weekend. Amen.
[35:01] We're going to have a tremendous time.
[35:03] So, praise the Lord. Amen. Let's um
[35:05] let's uh take our Bibles this morning.
[35:08] We're going to read from Joshua uh
[35:09] chapter 1 that we're going to read from
[35:12] um the book of Second Corinthians.
[35:15] Joshua 1. I know this is probably a well
[35:18] um we all know these scriptures, but
[35:22] just trust the Lord will bless his word
[35:24] to our hearts. Who's happy to be a
[35:25] Christian today? Praise the Lord. You
[35:28] may have had the worst the worst week of
[35:30] your entire life, but you're a believer.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd rather be a believer and
[35:34] you know than not, you know. So,
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that kind of puts everything
[35:38] in perspective, right? You know, if you
[35:40] know, if you're a Christian, you've
[35:41] you've won it all.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Everything's actually okay. So, I mean,
[35:45] Ephesians 1 and and and from verse two,
[35:48] I mean, sorry, Joshua 1 and verse two,
[35:50] Moses, my servant, is dead. Now
[35:52] therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
[35:54] thou and all this people unto the land
[35:56] which I do give to them, even to the
[35:58] children of Israel. Every place that the
[36:00] soul of your foot shall tread upon, that
[36:03] have I given unto you, as I said unto
[36:05] Moses, from the wilderness, and this
[36:08] Lebanon, even unto the great river, the
[36:10] river Euphrates, all the land of the
[36:12] Hittites, and unto the great sea towards
[36:14] the going down of the sun, shall be your
[36:16] coast. There shall not be any man be
[36:18] able to stand before thee all the days
[36:20] of thy life. For as I was with Moses, so
[36:23] shall I be with thee. I'll not fail
[36:25] thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of
[36:28] good courage. For unto this people shalt
[36:31] thou divide for an inheritance the land
[36:32] which I swear unto their fathers uh to
[36:35] give them. Only be thou strong and very
[36:38] courageous, that thou mayest observe to
[36:40] do according to all the law which Moses
[36:42] my servant commanded thee. Turn not from
[36:45] it to the right hand or to the left,
[36:46] that thou mayest prosper whethersoever
[36:49] thou goest. This book of the law shall
[36:51] not depart out of thy mouth, but thou
[36:53] shalt meditate there in day and night,
[36:55] that thou mayest observe to do according
[36:57] to all that is written therein. For then
[36:59] thou shalt um then for thou shalt make
[37:02] thy way prosperous, and thou shalt have
[37:05] good success. Have not I commanded thee?
[37:08] Be strong and of good courage. Be not
[37:10] afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for
[37:12] the Lord thy God is with thee wherever
[37:14] thou goest. Amen. And we're just going
[37:17] to turn to 2 Corinthians.
[37:19] I'm going to read just verses 1-7 here.
[37:23] And um
[37:28] so 2 Corinthians 5 and:es 1-7
[37:33] says, "For we know that if our earthly
[37:36] tabernac uh our earthly house of this
[37:38] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
[37:41] building of God and house not made with
[37:43] hands eternal in the heavens." Do you
[37:46] know that this morning?
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Is that personal to you?
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. For in this we grown earnestly
[37:52] desire to be clothed upon with our house
[37:54] which is from heaven. If so be that
[37:56] being clothed we shall not be found
[37:58] naked. For we uh that are in this
[38:01] tabernacle do grown being burdened. Not
[38:04] that we should be unclothed but clothed
[38:06] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[38:09] up of life. Now he that hath wrought us
[38:12] for the self, same as God, who also hath
[38:14] given unto us the earnest of the spirit.
[38:17] Therefore, we are always confident,
[38:19] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[38:21] this body, we're absent from the Lord.
[38:23] For we walk by faith, not by sight.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of
[38:28] prayer this morning. If you have a need,
[38:30] you just want to slip your hand up, say,
[38:31] "Lord, remember me during this time."
[38:33] Amen. God bless you. Gracious Father, as
[38:36] we stand here this morning, we invite
[38:37] you, Lord, as we sang the last song, let
[38:40] my Jesus change your life. And Lord, I
[38:42] just want to let you come and change my
[38:44] life this morning. Lord, you'd mold and
[38:45] shape dear God into your image. And not
[38:48] just me, but everyone here, Lord, those
[38:49] who may be streaming, Father, our desire
[38:51] is to be more like you. So, may you
[38:53] grant it this morning, I pray. May you
[38:54] anoint your word, not just uh not the
[38:57] speaker, but the hearer also. May you
[38:59] have complete liberty in our lives,
[39:00] Lord. just move as you want to move.
[39:02] Touch our lives. Do what you want to do,
[39:04] Lord. We want to praise and worship you
[39:06] this morning. We love you, Lord. We
[39:08] thank you for this grand opportunity. We
[39:09] pray you'd forgive us of our sins and
[39:11] our wrongs. Cleanse us of our secret
[39:13] faults, Father, this day. We thank you,
[39:15] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[39:18] Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[39:19] have your seats this morning. So, if I
[39:21] could title this, I want to speak about
[39:23] take courage.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Take courage this morning. Amen. Don't
[39:27] be don't be dismayed or or or troubled,
[39:30] but but be strong. Be of be of good
[39:33] courage. Now, as we read here in Joshua,
[39:36] this is very familiar, I'm sure, to to
[39:39] uh us all, but the book of the book of
[39:41] Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians,
[39:43] as as brother Ram would say, that the
[39:45] book of Joshua is the Ephesians of the
[39:47] Old Testament. It's the placing of the
[39:48] people in the land. And we are living in
[39:51] a in a Joshua generation, a Joshua
[39:54] season where we're not just wandering
[39:56] around in the wilderness round the same
[39:58] mountain over and over again, not
[40:00] claiming any land, just going to church,
[40:02] going home, coming back. And no, but we
[40:05] have entered into the promised land,
[40:06] which is Christ. As brother Bram would
[40:08] say, the son of man is the promised
[40:10] land. And we have entered uh you know,
[40:12] if you have received the baptism of the
[40:14] Holy Ghost, amen, you have entered into
[40:16] your inheritance. You've entered into
[40:18] Christ. And now we we are living in a
[40:21] season where um we're going to possess
[40:24] every promise where God has anointed his
[40:26] people that every promise does pertain
[40:28] to the bride of Jesus Christ. We're not
[40:31] living with a hope so one day that we
[40:33] can receive all things. But we have
[40:34] received all things today and we are
[40:37] here to push back every enemy, every
[40:39] every complex, every speck of unbelief.
[40:41] It doesn't matter if it was down through
[40:43] your family lineage. I tell you that's
[40:45] not important today. I think we need to
[40:47] look beyond our flesh. We don't walk by
[40:49] sight. We walk by faith. So, we don't
[40:51] walk by how we feel or we don't walk by
[40:54] our our temperament or our makeup or any
[40:56] of those things though that's part of
[40:58] us. But we have something far greater
[41:00] than your humanity this morning. We have
[41:02] the eternal God. Amen. Who's here to
[41:04] mold us, to shape us, to to to change
[41:07] our lives. And and you know, I believe,
[41:08] you know, I'm so thankful that we have
[41:10] no excuse, amen, to pull back. We have
[41:13] no excuse to to to blame anything or
[41:16] anybody. Amen. Why we would keep out of
[41:19] the promised land or possess more land.
[41:21] We have no excuses. Amen. God has given
[41:23] his full enablement to this generation.
[41:25] Amen. That we will possess every every
[41:28] speck of that land. Amen. Where there
[41:30] won't be one spirit holding us back.
[41:32] There'll be no unforgiveness. I say stop
[41:34] beating yourself up this morning. Amen.
[41:36] With your mistakes and your past. Put it
[41:38] under the blood. Recognize God is taking
[41:41] care of it. Amen. He's taking care of
[41:43] your past. He's taking care of you and
[41:45] your completeness. Amen. So, stop
[41:47] beating yourself up with the could be of
[41:49] life. Just walk on with God. Amen. We're
[41:52] not here to look in the rearview mirror.
[41:54] We're here to look forward. Amen. I
[41:56] believe that as we close this year out,
[41:58] amen. We're here to Amen. possess every
[42:00] divine promise of God. Amen. We're not
[42:02] here to just just we let's forget
[42:05] complexes. AMEN. GOD HAS MADE US IN SUCH
[42:08] A WAY that this humanity we will live in
[42:11] will not hinder the work of God. I mean
[42:13] because you have surrendered your life
[42:15] completely to God. So nothing in this
[42:17] flesh, nothing in your human spirit can
[42:19] hinder him because he's greater than
[42:21] you.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think we should just walk on
[42:25] with God this morning. We should take
[42:26] courage. Amen. That doesn't matter how
[42:28] great the battle's been. Doesn't matter
[42:30] what you've been going through. Amen.
[42:32] God is greater than that thing. Amen.
[42:34] And he is determined that you're going
[42:36] to pack out the victory. REMEMBER, IT'S
[42:38] NOT YOU THAT WINS the victory. It's who
[42:40] you surrender to gives you the victory.
[42:42] Amen. He conquered hell, death, and the
[42:43] grave. SO WHY NOT just rest in his
[42:46] ability? Rest in his power. REST IN THE
[42:48] FACT HE KNOWS ALL THINGS. Rest in the
[42:50] fact everything's working for your good.
[42:52] Rest in him. Amen. DON'T REST IN WHAT
[42:55] YOU CAN DO. AMEN. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT
[42:57] YOU can do, you'll fail miserably AND
[42:59] BECOME A BITTER PERSON. BUT IF you look
[43:00] at him, YOU REALIZE HIS TIME FRAME'S
[43:03] different to yours. Amen. His timing is
[43:05] the best. Amen. We want everything
[43:07] instant. But let God be God in your
[43:09] life. Amen. Just because you don't see
[43:11] the promise being fulfilled doesn't mean
[43:13] he hasn't heard YOUR PRAYER. AMEN. FAITH
[43:15] DOESN'T LOOK with by the five senses. It
[43:17] doesn't look by what you imagine. It
[43:19] looks by revelation. Amen. And we are
[43:22] people walking in revelation of the open
[43:24] book this morning where God has unveiled
[43:26] himself in his completeness. AMEN. THAT
[43:28] WE'RE NOT JUST HOPING ONE DAY THAT THERE
[43:31] WILL COME A PEOPLE OR THERE'LL COME A
[43:33] MESSAGE to restore all things. We're
[43:35] living in that day. I MEAN, WE'RE LIVING
[43:37] IN THE SEASON OF THE FULL RESTORATION OF
[43:39] THE WORD WHERE GOD HAS PLACED US IN IN
[43:41] HEAVENLY places in Christ Jesus. And if
[43:44] we are PLACED IN HEAVENLY PLACES, THE
[43:46] DEVIL'S UNDER OUR FEET. AMEN. SO, I
[43:48] friends, it's time to trample on the
[43:50] enemy. It's time to let him let God use
[43:53] your voice and address your enemy and
[43:56] bind that mumber in the name of Jesus
[43:57] Christ.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Joshua is told to be very strong.
[44:02] Be strong and very courageous. Amen. It
[44:05] takes a people of courage. I mean, I
[44:07] believe I'm not looking at cowards this
[44:09] morning. I believe I'm not looking at
[44:11] people who just want to hide away and
[44:13] watch life go by, but they want to go
[44:15] over the top of the trench. I mean, they
[44:17] want to take no man's land. They want to
[44:19] press the battle. Amen. You know, if we
[44:21] were there, you know, Brother Bam, the
[44:23] last words he heard from beyond the
[44:24] curtain of time was, "Keep pressing the
[44:26] battle. Keep pressing the battle." And I
[44:29] believe if we could hear that mighty
[44:30] host of witnesses that we're surrounded
[44:32] by, they'd say the same thing to you and
[44:34] I. Keep pressing the battle. Amen. The
[44:37] the baton's been placed in your hand.
[44:39] Amen. YOU MUST POSSESS ALL PROMISES.
[44:41] AMEN. AMEN. WE'RE WAITING on you CUZ
[44:43] WITHOUT YOU, WE CANNOT BE MADE PERFECT
[44:45] or complete. Amen. So friends, TAKE
[44:47] COURAGE THIS MORNING. REMEMBER, WHO IS
[44:49] THE GOD WHO SENT YOU? YOU WEREN'T SENT
[44:51] BY A CHURCH. YOU WEREN'T SENT BY YOUR
[44:53] OWN AMBITION. YOU WEREN'T sent by some
[44:55] man or some system. No, YOU WERE SENT BY
[44:57] ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. LIKE JOSHUA WAS
[45:00] COMMISSIONED BY GOD. I'VE HAVE I NOT
[45:02] COMMANDED THEE?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; HAVE I NOT SENT THEE?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Be strong
[45:07] &gt;&gt; and very courageous.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we do not walk in this world
[45:13] groaning to leave it because of how bad
[45:15] it is.
[45:16] I'm just basically
[45:18] &gt;&gt; saying what Paul said.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; He said we we are in this tabernacle. We
[45:22] do groan
[45:23] &gt;&gt; being burdened not that we would be
[45:24] unclothed.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; So this world is falling apart but
[45:28] that's not the groan of our hearts why
[45:30] we want to leave. We want to be with the
[45:32] Lord.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have an ambition. I want to
[45:34] see him.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I want to see his glorious face.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; I want to see him.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; We're going to meet him one day. That's
[45:41] the ambition of my life. Lord, I want to
[45:43] see your plan done. I want to see a plan
[45:45] of redemption complete where every man,
[45:48] woman, and child, boy, and girl, Amen,
[45:50] who's part of your lamb's book of life
[45:52] is dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:54] that we can go home cuz I want to see
[45:56] him.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is our desire of our life.
[45:59] Amen. I'm I'm talking for you. As I say
[46:02] we, I'm not just saying this royal we
[46:03] thing, but that's that's your feeling,
[46:05] right? That's what Don't you want to see
[46:06] him? Oh, how's he going to treat me?
[46:09] Well, he's given you his unfailing love
[46:10] this side. Amen. So that means he's he's
[46:13] not going to change his mind. He can't
[46:15] change his mind about you that side.
[46:17] Amen. His thoughts towards you here are
[46:18] the same thoughts there. Amen. When he
[46:21] sees you face to face physically, he's
[46:22] not going to say, "Oh, well, I got that
[46:24] wrong." He's not that kind of a God. He
[46:27] sees you perfectly as you are right now.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. With your struggles, with your
[46:32] humanity, all those things that doesn't
[46:34] even come into his scales of of making a
[46:37] conclusion about you. No, he saw you
[46:39] before the foundation of the world.
[46:41] Amen. Made in his image, spotless,
[46:43] perfect, without blemish or any such
[46:45] thing. Amen. And if he saw you that way,
[46:47] that's how you're going to end up. And
[46:49] that's the condition of your soul this
[46:50] morning.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We say it is well with our soul.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So courage, Webster would tell us,
[46:57] is a mental or moral strength to
[46:59] venture. It means to persevere and
[47:02] withstand danger, fear, or difficulty.
[47:04] Amen. So I believe that we we have the
[47:07] mental or moral strength I say the
[47:09] spiritual strength to venture out
[47:11] &gt;&gt; to take God at his word. Now we're not
[47:13] pursuing
[47:15] any promise of God. We are not living in
[47:17] an age where the bride of Jesus Christ
[47:19] is presuming or probing. No, all of
[47:22] God's word has been revealed. We're
[47:24] venturing. If there's a promise in the
[47:26] word for you, it's actually you're not
[47:28] presuming. You can venture with
[47:29] authority. It's mine because all that
[47:32] Jesus died on Calvary for is given to
[47:34] me. Amen. So we're not guessing or maybe
[47:36] it's mine or just yes. No, we're presume
[47:39] we are not presuming as brother preaches
[47:41] sermon presuming, right? No, we are we
[47:43] are venturing with authority. Amen. All
[47:46] of heaven is behind you. Amen. God
[47:48] himself is behind you. If God be for us,
[47:50] who can be against us? You got to put
[47:52] yourself IN THAT SCRIPTURE. IF GOD
[47:53] BEFORE ME, WHAT CAN BE AGAINST ME? AMEN.
[47:56] There's nothing can withstand you if God
[47:58] is for you. Amen. In the strong
[48:00] concordance says uh it says the
[48:02] primitive uh root of it is to be alert
[48:06] physically on foot or mentally
[48:07] encouraged. I mean to be courageous of
[48:09] good courage steadfastly minded. I trust
[48:12] we have made up our mind. We're not in
[48:15] this balance of is God's word right or
[48:17] is it not? Is God God or is he not? You
[48:20] know, no. I believe that I'm looking at
[48:23] people who have made up their mind.
[48:24] They're steadfastly minded. God is
[48:27] always right.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is right above my feelings.
[48:30] He's right above my culture. He's right
[48:32] above my upbringing. He's right above
[48:34] wherever I'm living. He's right above my
[48:36] imaginations. His word is always right
[48:39] compared to what?
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Compared to me.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll take his word above all
[48:44] things. I trust we are steadfastly
[48:46] minded in that. Amen. That we are not
[48:48] here to try and twist the scripture or
[48:50] twist the message to meet our own ends.
[48:52] But we're here to say, God, change me to
[48:54] match your word. That's all I'm
[48:55] interested in. Amen. this morning.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; It means to be to to establish. It means
[49:00] to fortify. I mean, we're being
[49:02] fortified. But I'm just going to go
[49:04] through this list a bit cuz you got to
[49:05] realize this is what God's made you to
[49:07] be. You're fortified. Amen. Behind the
[49:09] word of God. You're not on some
[49:11] battlefield unarmed. Just some sitting
[49:14] duck or you know that kind of thing. No.
[49:16] No. You're armed and dangerous this
[49:17] morning. I mean, the word of God, that
[49:19] sharp two-edged sword, Amen, is in your
[49:21] mouth.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] Amen. It means to harden. Now the
[49:26] believer does not harden their hearts
[49:28] against their fellow believer.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or against this fall people in
[49:32] this fallen world.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; No, that's no. Taking courage is willing
[49:36] to be vulnerable. Taking courage is
[49:38] being willing to care to venture out and
[49:40] actually stretch out a hand of
[49:42] fellowship to show you care to show you
[49:44] love. Amen. A coward will build a wall,
[49:47] build a bunker in their heart and hide
[49:49] away. We're not here to build bunkers.
[49:52] I'm not interested in concrete working.
[49:54] You know, I was in Yeah, I know I've
[49:56] said this before, but you know, my
[49:57] parents, they used to live in Papa Newu
[49:59] Guinea where the Japanese had their
[50:00] headquarters of that part of the
[50:02] Pacific. And I was Admiral Yamamoto was
[50:04] the leader of the Japanese forces there.
[50:06] I've been in his bunker. This is the
[50:08] Admiral leading that part of the Pacific
[50:11] theater. It's a short, dingy, it's a
[50:15] dark. There's nothing nice about it. And
[50:18] he would have had the best bunker there
[50:19] was. He's the admiral. Admiral. Why
[50:22] build a bunker when you can walk out and
[50:24] you can you can enjoy God's pasture, the
[50:27] sun shining, the goodness of God, the
[50:30] spirit of God blowing. Why h why hold
[50:32] yourself away in some damp dingy thing
[50:35] where you just well I'm just going to,
[50:36] you know, I'm just going to preserve
[50:38] myself and I don't want to, you know, I
[50:40] don't want to share anything and I'm
[50:42] just going to protect my heart. I've
[50:43] been hurt before and yeah, but God's the
[50:45] healer.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; God's the healer. I mean, there's
[50:48] nothing in life that, you know, of us,
[50:50] right? There's nothing in life that God
[50:52] can't fix.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's never a He's not the kind
[50:56] of doctor that you get to a point where
[50:58] he says, "I'm sorry. I can't help you
[50:59] anymore."
[51:01] &gt;&gt; That is human doctors. Amen. He is the
[51:03] great physician. Amen. So, there's
[51:05] nothing. But you've got to be willing to
[51:07] put yourself on his operating table and
[51:09] let him do a work. Amen. In spite of
[51:11] who's done it to you, how bad. I'm not
[51:14] negating any of those things, but you
[51:15] got to be willing. Lord, fix me.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Fix me, Lord. It takes someone with
[51:22] courage to do that.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes a coward who will hide
[51:27] their symptoms and hide away. But it
[51:28] takes courage to step out and actually
[51:31] take God at his word. It take it took
[51:33] non the greatest courage. He was the he
[51:36] was a general in the Syrian or what you
[51:38] know enemies of Israel his you know
[51:40] their army. You know he was a coward
[51:42] hiding behind those bandages when he had
[51:44] the leprosy.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But you see his servant girl had so much
[51:48] a god about her. She just said, "Man, I
[51:49] wish I wish non was in Israel. There's a
[51:52] prophet in Israel that could heal him
[51:54] and there'd be no recorded case of
[51:55] anyone being healed of leprosy before."
[51:57] But she just had a faith. She had a
[51:59] courage. My God can fix your problem.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you tell someone that out
[52:03] of love. Amen. That's taking courage.
[52:05] Not just sympathizing with someone.
[52:07] Actually, you know, God can help you.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus can change your life.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then, so what did he do? He
[52:14] was willing to stop hiding. And it took
[52:16] him more courage to go to the king and
[52:17] show his vulnerability, show his secret
[52:20] places. Amen. Show that sin that was
[52:22] hidden behind armor out in the public.
[52:25] But at home, it really came out. We are
[52:27] our best and worst at home.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can put on a mask and you
[52:31] can you can you can put on a message
[52:34] mask and put on a message kind of
[52:35] persona and you can that's basically
[52:37] putting bandages on, putting arm on. You
[52:39] can come to church and you can you can
[52:41] pretend all is well, but there's one
[52:43] person you can never fall and that's
[52:44] God.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God sees straight through your
[52:47] bandages and he sees your need, but the
[52:49] thing is you're going to be willing,
[52:51] Lord, I need a place to dip that I can
[52:53] be cleansed.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So non non you know, he could hide
[52:57] from his soldiers, but he couldn't hide
[52:58] from his family. And then so and then
[53:01] and then his servant girl told him
[53:02] about, you know, Israel. There's a
[53:04] prophet there. And you know, then he
[53:06] went to the king and you know the rest
[53:07] of the story. But he's willing to, it
[53:10] took him real courage to say, "I have
[53:13] this thing in my life that if I let it
[53:15] keep going, I will become an exile.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; I'll become in a leper colony. The
[53:21] person everyone thought I was, I'm not
[53:23] because of this disease.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Sin will get you.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; It's not worth holding on to."
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to go to the River
[53:34] Jordan to be cleansed. There's a
[53:37] fountain filled with blood flowing from
[53:39] Emanuel's veins. You can plunge and you
[53:41] say, "Well, I'm saved. I'm not even
[53:43] talking about that necessarily." But if
[53:45] you've got something's got a hold of
[53:46] your life, something that you brought
[53:48] out of Egypt, not even knowing about it.
[53:50] Amen. Then God can take that from you. I
[53:53] mean, there's a reason why Joshua, we
[53:54] don't have it here, but he would tell
[53:56] the children of Israel, we got to circum
[53:58] God would say, "Circumcise again." So,
[54:00] we've been going through Joshua and
[54:01] family prayer. So, that's where all
[54:02] these things have come from. So, sorry
[54:05] children. And this is you're getting it
[54:06] again. Okay. But you see, they they were
[54:10] told circumcise again because the
[54:12] reproach of Egypt had to be taken off of
[54:14] their lives. Even though some of them
[54:16] weren't even born in Egypt, but yet that
[54:18] reproach had to be gone. And so it's the
[54:20] same thing with us. We can carry things
[54:21] out of the world. We don't realize we
[54:23] have. We've been called out. We've been
[54:25] justified. But God needs to we we need
[54:28] another circumcision sometimes. Amen.
[54:30] Because you're going into a greater
[54:31] walk. Going to a greater inheritance.
[54:34] Amen. We're not living in the wilderness
[54:36] having church splits and fussing and
[54:38] fighting and you know all those kind of
[54:39] things. No, we're going into Canaan's
[54:41] fair land. I believe we're already
[54:42] there. But you got to realize friends,
[54:44] we're not here to go around a mountain.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Don't go around a mountain from your
[54:48] past of something that you just keep in
[54:50] your mind that just keeps ruling you and
[54:52] this thing and you just keep and it and
[54:54] it becomes a focal point of your life.
[54:56] Doesn't matter if you walk around this
[54:57] side of the mountain, you get married,
[54:58] you walk around this side, you've had
[55:00] children, but this thing holds you. It's
[55:02] like it's you're stuck in its orbit,
[55:04] &gt;&gt; right? Let God break that.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Let God break that. Amen. That you can
[55:08] turn northward and walk into every
[55:09] divine promise of God.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[55:15] we as as Joshua was told, don't fear.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Fear not. And what was the first words
[55:23] the angel told brother Brandham? Fear
[55:25] not, for I've been sent from the
[55:26] presence of almighty God. Amen. So
[55:28] there's one thing that there is a
[55:30] constant battle or can be is we are
[55:32] called not to fear.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thing is if you allow fear to
[55:37] grip you, Amen, it will rule you. But
[55:39] your thing is you got to realize
[55:40] everything of the enemy that tries to
[55:42] bind you down. You don't have to bow
[55:43] down to that thing. But you've been
[55:45] given authority by the blood of Jesus
[55:47] Christ, by the word of God, amen, to
[55:49] bind that thing and put it under your
[55:51] feet. Amen. Cuz God wants to give you a
[55:53] testimony. Amen. He doesn't He doesn't
[55:55] just want to have Brother Bram's
[55:57] testimony. He must have a living
[55:58] testimony in 2025. That's what he's
[56:01] interested in this day. Amen. Sure, it's
[56:03] good to quote the prophet stories, but
[56:05] what about your story? What has God done
[56:07] in your life? Amen. Cuz the same God
[56:09] that was with Moses was with Joshua,
[56:11] right? The same God that was with the
[56:13] prophet is now with the bride. Amen. So,
[56:15] we are here that everything will be
[56:18] under our feet. Now, he was told, "Fear
[56:20] not."
[56:22] You know, the enemy only has enough
[56:24] power. We're talking about this too at
[56:26] home. The enemy only has enough power
[56:29] that you give him. Brother um would be
[56:32] asked in questions and answers. Quite a
[56:34] lengthy answer, but I just give a
[56:35] section of it here. He says, "Now that
[56:37] man was um uh was some of these spirits
[56:40] that was cast out of the swine in Gdara,
[56:42] some of those poor people out there in
[56:44] the insane institution being their heads
[56:46] against patter cells. Remember, devils
[56:48] never die. Devils always live. But there
[56:51] will be a time when devils will have to
[56:52] die. Amen. they will become totally
[56:55] annihilated. But now they're alive and
[56:58] they work from generation to generation
[57:00] from um upon human beings. Some of them
[57:03] is in the form of a cancer. Some's in
[57:04] the form of epilepsy. Some's in the form
[57:06] of tuberculosis. They get into the
[57:09] flesh. But seemingly they are powerless
[57:11] until they get into a person. They have
[57:14] to operate through a person. Well, how
[57:17] does that normally begin? No, I'm not
[57:19] talking about just I'm talking about
[57:20] spiritual problems here. Now we know
[57:23] through cancer things there's a bruised
[57:24] cell the devil gets in through that
[57:26] bruised cell right and and and then it's
[57:28] the same in the spiritual side there be
[57:30] a bruise or a wound you can be you know
[57:32] you know Joshua was told don't be
[57:33] dismayed right we can be dismayed at at
[57:37] how other people treat us or how even
[57:39] our own uh behavior we can become very
[57:43] discouraged in ourselves but Joshua was
[57:45] told don't be dismayed right don't fear
[57:49] be of strong be of good courage
[57:51] And then so but what happens is the
[57:54] enemy uh you know these things happen in
[57:57] our life and that's like a doorway the
[57:59] enemy can step in and many times things
[58:02] like fear can come in because there's
[58:03] always the fear of the unknown what's
[58:06] going to happen tomorrow. Many people
[58:08] they overthink life and they cross
[58:10] bridges before they get to them. They
[58:12] already got a in their mind this is the
[58:14] trajectory of their life and this is
[58:16] where it's going to go. I tell you what,
[58:18] nine times or 99% of the time, it's the
[58:21] enemy leading that imagination because
[58:24] it always ends up in ruin. It always
[58:25] ends up in calamity. But friends, if you
[58:28] just let God lead your thoughts, amen,
[58:30] those thoughts don't go negative into
[58:32] destruction, but they go into peace.
[58:34] They go into joy. They go into love.
[58:37] They go into faith. Amen. They come into
[58:39] a positive attitude. Amen. Let God lead
[58:42] your thinking that way. Don't let DON'T
[58:44] LET YOUR THINKING go negative. You're
[58:45] going to realize that's the enemy trying
[58:47] to derail you, make you dismayed, and
[58:49] he's trying to put a spirit of fear upon
[58:51] you to to to uh disable your Christian
[58:54] walk. Amen. But I tell you what,
[58:56] friends, fear is not our king.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord JESUS CHRIST IS MY KING.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And and and he is the great one.
[59:04] Amen. He there's no fear in him.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that kind of fear that
[59:08] cripples. Amen. There's a reverential
[59:10] fear and trust. That's godly fear. But
[59:12] you know with us, you know, we're not
[59:14] here to live in fear.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; But fear is powerless until it can get
[59:19] someone to work through,
[59:21] &gt;&gt; right? But you know, you know, it's just
[59:23] like a bad attitude. You know what is
[59:24] that? That's a spirit that can bother
[59:26] someone. They can they can, you know, be
[59:28] so positive something happens just a bad
[59:30] attitude. Then what happens? They just
[59:31] start spouting negative things about
[59:34] people about their life and this is
[59:36] going on and they'll somehow swing the
[59:38] whole conversation negative. Who's who's
[59:40] experienced that?
[59:42] Right?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; What is that? Now, it's it's because
[59:45] that spirit is powerless until it can
[59:47] find someone to work through.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; But friends, I believe we're here that
[59:50] the devil, you know, the devil should be
[59:52] absolutely powerless in our lives.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That everything he tries to drag
[59:57] us down by, he just ends up defeated.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know we will be tried by every
[1:00:02] spirit, but every spirit will fall at
[1:00:04] our feet.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God has ordained it thus
[1:00:07] in this age. that we will not go down in
[1:00:09] defeat, but we will climb in victory.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you never ever never ever let
[1:00:14] a negative thought roost in your mind.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Always have a positive attitude. You
[1:00:19] know, you say, "Well, I got nothing
[1:00:20] positive to think on." Well, actually,
[1:00:22] you got a lot to think on
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; that's positive. Amen. You just take the
[1:00:26] message of the hour or you take the
[1:00:27] Bible. There's a lot of positive things,
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; isn't that right? Well, you know, my
[1:00:33] life and what's going on. Look at the
[1:00:35] eternal. Why don't you zoom out to the
[1:00:37] big picture?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, I
[1:00:40] was made in his image, rejoicing,
[1:00:42] dancing in God's thinking. God brought
[1:00:44] me through this process. He says it's
[1:00:46] like a photograph. Back in the day
[1:00:47] before there was I think you can still
[1:00:49] buy some old school film,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; right? Before it was digital, right?
[1:00:54] What happens is you take that you take
[1:00:56] that film and you take it into a dark
[1:00:58] room. You pro and then you and then you
[1:00:59] take it through a chemical process. So
[1:01:02] what was captured on the film now
[1:01:03] becomes material. You can see it, right?
[1:01:06] And it's the same thing. This world is a
[1:01:08] dark room,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; but through a through a process
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; of justification, sanctification, the
[1:01:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost, trials,
[1:01:16] hardship, different things, God is
[1:01:18] bringing forth an image that was there
[1:01:19] from the foundation of the world.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can rejoice saying, "Well,
[1:01:23] I'm just going through a process.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; How's life?" Yeah, I'm just being
[1:01:26] processed
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; by God to do to the image he had of me
[1:01:31] is now being formed.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's determined it's
[1:01:34] going to be formed.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. A Amen. So they are seemingly
[1:01:39] powerless till they can get a person.
[1:01:41] Amen. That they can operate through.
[1:01:42] Which brings to another thought that the
[1:01:45] Holy Ghost covers the earth, but it's
[1:01:47] almost helpless until it can get into
[1:01:49] you and me.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Because God is a gentleman.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; He does not force anything upon anybody.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be willing to let him
[1:01:59] live. That's why you take the, you know,
[1:02:01] Hebrews 11, the heroes of faith. And we
[1:02:04] can bring that down to 20:25. Everyone
[1:02:06] in the heroes of faith, every believer
[1:02:09] now that's got a testimony, one thing
[1:02:11] happened. They allowed God to live.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; They allowed God to reveal himself. They
[1:02:17] allowed God to live in their lives.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is depending on you and I, the
[1:02:22] Holy Spirit. The earth is full of the
[1:02:24] spirit of God but uh but it's poured out
[1:02:26] but it cannot operate till it comes into
[1:02:28] us we human beings to operate and the
[1:02:31] devil wants to take us over to operate
[1:02:33] under him. So when we uh when he gets
[1:02:36] the mild form he starts in sin if he can
[1:02:38] hold just a just in a righteous man a
[1:02:41] good man and let him go ahead and try to
[1:02:42] be good like that. If he can hold him
[1:02:44] like that until he's dead that's all he
[1:02:46] wants to do. He's got him. Because no
[1:02:48] matter how righteous you are, how good
[1:02:50] you are, how moral you are, how clean
[1:02:52] you are, how honest you are, you'll
[1:02:54] never get to heaven until you are born
[1:02:56] again. Jesus said, "So you've got to be
[1:02:59] born. You've got to be regenerated or
[1:03:02] there's not a way in the world you can
[1:03:03] enter heaven or ever come to Christ."
[1:03:06] Amen. So don't just be a good person.
[1:03:09] Don't just be a good message person.
[1:03:11] Come to Christ. Let him give you a
[1:03:13] birth, a real experience, a change.
[1:03:16] Amen. where you realize something's
[1:03:17] happened to you.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Joshua would be told before
[1:03:22] they ever crossed the Jordan
[1:03:24] that God is going to give them a sign
[1:03:27] that they're going to take the whole
[1:03:28] land.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I love this. And Joshua
[1:03:33] said unto the children of Israel, "Come
[1:03:34] hither and hear the words of the Lord
[1:03:35] your God." And Joshua said, "Hereby you
[1:03:38] shall know that the living God is among
[1:03:39] you, and that he will without fail," say
[1:03:42] without fail.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Without fail,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; drive out from before you the Canaanites
[1:03:46] and the Hittites and the Hivites and the
[1:03:48] Pesites and the Gersites, the Amorites
[1:03:50] and the Jebusites. Amen. So whatever
[1:03:53] itites that have been there camping on
[1:03:54] your promises, he's going to drive it
[1:03:56] out. Indifference, he's going to drive
[1:03:58] it out. You can't forgive, he's going to
[1:04:00] drive it out. Impatience, he's going to
[1:04:02] drive it out. I mean, some luster, he's
[1:04:04] going to drive it out. I mean, whatever
[1:04:05] the thing is that that that that you've
[1:04:07] got to that that's in your life that's
[1:04:08] going to be it's going to be all driven
[1:04:10] out without fail.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, the ark of the covenant of
[1:04:14] the Lord of all the earth passeth over
[1:04:17] before you into Jordan. Now therefore,
[1:04:19] take you 12 men out of the tribes of
[1:04:21] Israel, out of every tribe of man. It
[1:04:23] shall come to pass as soon as the souls
[1:04:26] of the feet of the priests that bear the
[1:04:27] ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the
[1:04:29] earth, shall rest in the waters of
[1:04:31] Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall
[1:04:33] be cut off from the waters that come up
[1:04:35] from above, and they shall stand upon
[1:04:37] and heap. Amen. So by this, God saying,
[1:04:40] "By this, you'll know you're going to
[1:04:41] take the whole land." So before they
[1:04:43] ever set foot in the promised land, God
[1:04:44] says, "By this sign, you're going to
[1:04:47] without fail conquer all."
[1:04:50] And then the scripture goes that that
[1:04:52] you know as soon as the uh priests put
[1:04:54] their soul their foot in the in the
[1:04:56] Jordan that it parted. Amen. And however
[1:04:59] hund I mean however hundreds of
[1:05:00] thousands or million or however many
[1:05:02] people with their oxen and their sheep
[1:05:04] and all their possessions they cross
[1:05:06] over on dry land. Amen. They not even
[1:05:08] fought a battle in the promised land
[1:05:10] yet. Not even got to Jericho. Hadn't got
[1:05:12] anywhere near those things. But God says
[1:05:14] when you see this happen Amen. I'm gonna
[1:05:17] This is a sign. You're going to without
[1:05:18] fail. Amen. Cross I mean possess the
[1:05:22] whole land. And we've had a prophet
[1:05:23] stand in this day. Amen. He's carried
[1:05:26] the ark of the word and every true
[1:05:27] minister carries it as well. Not on the
[1:05:29] head but in the heart. Amen. You know
[1:05:30] the ark of all the covenant of God.
[1:05:33] Amen. Carried down to that river Jordan.
[1:05:35] What does Jordan represent? Death to
[1:05:37] self. Amen. And he and what happens is
[1:05:40] that word actually gives you an entrance
[1:05:42] to cross over into Canaan's fear land.
[1:05:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not trying to wait over
[1:05:49] in our own ability, our own thoughts.
[1:05:51] No, God has given a way. Amen. For us to
[1:05:54] die to ourselves. Amen. He gives us
[1:05:56] grace. Amen. To make a full surrender,
[1:05:58] then that grace imparts his nature, his
[1:06:01] own presence into our lives. Amen. And
[1:06:03] if so, if you have received the baptism
[1:06:05] of the Holy Ghost, God is telling you by
[1:06:08] this you shall know, you will possess
[1:06:10] all things. Amen. Without fail, you'll
[1:06:13] conquer all. Amen. THERE'S NOT ONE THING
[1:06:16] THAT CANNOT BE CONQUERED. AMEN. By the
[1:06:18] spirit of God within you. Everything
[1:06:20] must be under YOUR FEET. EVERY PART OF
[1:06:22] THE PROMISED LAND, THERE'S NOT ONE INCH
[1:06:23] THAT THE DEVIL MUST HOLD. WITHOUT FAIL,
[1:06:26] YOU'LL TAKE IT ALL. AMEN. WELL, YOU SAY,
[1:06:27] "I'VE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE TRY AND FAIL,
[1:06:29] BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU. AND I'VE SEEN OTHER
[1:06:31] CHURCHES RISE AND FAIL, BUT THEY'RE NOT
[1:06:33] YOU. I'VE SEEN OTHER FAMILIES FALL
[1:06:35] APART, BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU." AMEN. I'VE
[1:06:36] SEEN OTHER CHILDREN NEVER COME BACK, BUT
[1:06:38] THEY'RE NOT YOURS. AMEN. DON'T LIVE BY
[1:06:40] WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE. LIVE BY THE
[1:06:43] PROMISE OF GOD TO YOU. AMEN. THAT
[1:06:45] WITHOUT FAIL YOU YOU WILL RECEIVE ALL.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't just have positive
[1:06:52] thinking. We got a revelation of God. I
[1:06:55] mean, the reality of his word. I say
[1:06:56] without fail, you say, "Well, I don't
[1:06:58] know." Yo, well, what about that person?
[1:07:00] Forget those people. It's you and God.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; It's me and Jesus. We're going all the
[1:07:05] way straight and narrow way. There's
[1:07:07] only room for two on the road. Me and
[1:07:09] him.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And actually, it's such
[1:07:12] a narrow way. He goes before me. He's my
[1:07:14] shepherd.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I think I think we can take
[1:07:18] courage this morning.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you brought me thus far
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; and you've now you've shown me, Lord,
[1:07:24] I'm going to get it all back. I'm going
[1:07:26] to recover all like David in that great
[1:07:27] time of transition between Saul, you
[1:07:30] know, Saul's death and David becoming
[1:07:32] king over Israel. Amen. He lost
[1:07:34] everything. Amen. His men lost
[1:07:36] everything in Ziglag. They lost their
[1:07:38] families, their loved ones, their
[1:07:40] everything precious. The things they
[1:07:41] held most dear, they lost it all that
[1:07:43] time of transition. But what did he do?
[1:07:45] He took courage. He encouraged himself
[1:07:48] in the Lord. Amen. He didn't walk by
[1:07:50] sight. He walked by faith. Amen. He went
[1:07:52] to his source of strength. Amen. Which
[1:07:54] is the Lord himself. And then God said,
[1:07:57] "You will recover all without fail."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "Shall I pursue? What should I
[1:08:02] do in the circumstances?" His men wanted
[1:08:04] to stone him. He was in a dire strait of
[1:08:06] a situation, but he turned to a source
[1:08:09] of strength. And I tell you what,
[1:08:11] friends, if you feel discouraged this
[1:08:12] morning, turn to your source of courage.
[1:08:15] Amen. Which is the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:08:16] Turn to your source of strength. Begin
[1:08:18] feeding on the GOOD THINGS OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:08:20] DON'T FEED ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD.
[1:08:22] STOP DOOM SCROLLING AND start joy
[1:08:24] turning a wonder. Turn the Bible. Amen.
[1:08:27] You get some joy in your soul. You'll
[1:08:28] get happy about it. Amen. So swap one
[1:08:31] for the other and you'll you'll find
[1:08:32] courage come into your life. Hallelujah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's Ron Spencer tells a
[1:08:37] story. Some others I've heard it. You
[1:08:38] know, there was a there was a cat
[1:08:40] chasing a mouse and that mouse was
[1:08:42] running and the cat was, you know, after
[1:08:45] it running on tables, chairs up and
[1:08:47] down, running for its life. This mouse
[1:08:48] was I mean, then finally, you know, the
[1:08:50] cat kind of just left the pursuit or
[1:08:52] something and this because this mouse
[1:08:54] actually jumped and it landed into a
[1:08:56] bottle of wine, you know, and then the
[1:08:59] bottle turned over. But this but this
[1:09:01] but this mouse was drinking all this
[1:09:02] wine and the cat thought well the mouse
[1:09:04] is dead so it just wandered off. But
[1:09:06] then the mouse slowly, you know, slipped
[1:09:08] out of the bottle of wine. It was half
[1:09:10] empty and the mouse was staggering like
[1:09:12] this. Says, now where's that cat
[1:09:16] and started drinking some courage?
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. IT MADE IT FEEL THAT IT WAS
[1:09:21] BIGGER than the cat.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT MADE HIM FEEL THAT HE WAS
[1:09:25] STRONGER THAN THAT CAT. THAT THAT CAT
[1:09:27] HAD SOMETHING TO FEAR NOW. AMEN. IT BE
[1:09:29] WHY? CUZ THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT IN THE
[1:09:31] MOUSE BECAME EXPONENTIAL. HALLELUJAH. I
[1:09:34] tell you what, friends. Start drinking
[1:09:36] on the goodness of God. Amen. YOUR WALK
[1:09:39] WILL START MAY MAYBE YOU'LL BE GOING JOY
[1:09:41] AND peace and you'll be all happy. Say,
[1:09:43] now where is that devil?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I mean, WHERE'S THIS PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN
[1:09:46] AFFLICTING ME? I'm going to deal with
[1:09:48] this thing once and for all.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what we need to do.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a um Yeah, it's it's not
[1:09:55] how big we are.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; It's how big he is. That's how big our
[1:10:00] God is that counts. Amen. It's not
[1:10:02] people who take courage, they say, you
[1:10:04] know, people who take courage look
[1:10:05] beyond themselves. They look beyond
[1:10:07] their own ability. How? Amen. And you
[1:10:10] know, the believer, who do we look to?
[1:10:12] We look to our Lord.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We look to our great shepherd.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he's greater than them all. As
[1:10:19] I said a while ago, I just want to read
[1:10:21] it though. He says, "And Jesus said to
[1:10:23] them again, peace be unto you. As my
[1:10:25] father has sent me, even so send I you.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; That same commission's been placed in
[1:10:31] your life.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The resurrected Lord Jesus says,
[1:10:34] "As my father sent me, I'm sending you
[1:10:36] to this world.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have a living witness here
[1:10:39] in this place, and it's you." Amen. So,
[1:10:42] and you know, it's the same thing with
[1:10:43] Moses. The God that sent Moses went in
[1:10:45] Moses to perform
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; his word. It's the same thing with you
[1:10:49] and I. The God that sent you is in you
[1:10:51] that he will perform his word in your
[1:10:53] life. Amen. Because just like brother
[1:10:56] brother would say that as Jesus
[1:10:58] fulfilled all the prophecies of the old
[1:10:59] testament so the bride will fulfill the
[1:11:01] testimonies of the new. Well how's that
[1:11:03] going to happen? Our ability absolutely
[1:11:05] not. Human ability can never bring the
[1:11:07] word of god to pass. But if you just
[1:11:09] surrender to him amen that he will bring
[1:11:11] his word to pass in your life.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the lord.
[1:11:17] You know, many times, like brother B
[1:11:19] would say in the Hebrew series, he'd
[1:11:20] say, "Many times we tell people what
[1:11:22] they should stop doing or what they
[1:11:24] ought not to do." Amen. But Paul wasn't
[1:11:27] that way. When the Philippian jailer,
[1:11:29] you know, after Paul and Silas had a had
[1:11:31] a praise praise break there in the
[1:11:33] prison, they begin to praise God cuz
[1:11:35] they realized God was above their pain,
[1:11:37] their hurt, their their no doubt
[1:11:39] disappointment of ending up in jail when
[1:11:41] they're there on a mission trip. And God
[1:11:43] shook the whole place, unshackled
[1:11:45] everybody, opened every prison door, and
[1:11:47] then the Philippian jailer there, the
[1:11:49] jailer was going to kill himself because
[1:11:51] that was his thing. If he let anyone um
[1:11:53] you know, escape, it was his life.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; But then, but then as he's about to do
[1:11:58] that, he heard a voice from the inner
[1:12:00] prison, which was Paul and Silas. They
[1:12:01] said, "Don't harm yourself. We're all
[1:12:03] still here."
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And then so the Philippian jailer said,
[1:12:06] "Men, what must I do to be saved?" And
[1:12:09] many times when people ask that, we say,
[1:12:11] "Well, you need to stop this and you
[1:12:12] need to stop doing this and stop
[1:12:14] drinking and stop smoking and stop this
[1:12:16] and stop gaming and stop gambling and
[1:12:18] all these things. Dress right, all these
[1:12:20] things." But Paul didn't say what you
[1:12:22] had to stop doing. He said what you need
[1:12:24] to do.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what you need to do will
[1:12:27] take care of the things that you need to
[1:12:28] stop doing.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he say? Believe on the
[1:12:31] Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy
[1:12:33] house shall be saved. In other words,
[1:12:35] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for thy
[1:12:36] house. Amen. Because faith in God will
[1:12:39] take care of everything. I mean, it'll
[1:12:41] take care of everything that's hung on
[1:12:43] us from out of the world. If it's a
[1:12:45] religious spirit, legalism, faith in the
[1:12:48] Lord will take care of that. I mean,
[1:12:50] things that people struggle with because
[1:12:51] of the flesh.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; IT'LL TAKE CARE of those things. I mean,
[1:12:55] we're to be encouraged this morning.
[1:12:57] Believe faith works.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Faith is a power.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is prevailing. Amen. revelation
[1:13:04] which is faith there. It is a prevailing
[1:13:07] power. This morning, Brother Arab said
[1:13:09] there's nothing as prevailing with power
[1:13:11] as revelation.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, well,
[1:13:15] I'm battling this thing." Believe on the
[1:13:17] Lord Jesus Christ. He'll take care of
[1:13:19] it. Amen. Faith brings everything into
[1:13:21] perspective.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is what controls everything.
[1:13:26] And what does faith do? Put you in God's
[1:13:27] hands.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the same thing with
[1:13:30] prayer. Prayer isn't necessarily us
[1:13:32] changing God's mind. It's God changing
[1:13:34] our mind. And he does it through prayer.
[1:13:36] Amen. And it puts the whole situation in
[1:13:38] God's control.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says Paul never told him that. He
[1:13:43] just told him the things he ought to do.
[1:13:45] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:13:47] thou shalt be saved. Now he that heareth
[1:13:49] my words believeth on him that sent me
[1:13:51] has everlasting life. That's a thunder
[1:13:53] flashing. John 5:24. I'm the Lord that
[1:13:56] heals all thy diseases. James 5:14,
[1:13:59] "Call the elders, anoint them uh in oil,
[1:14:02] prayer of faith will save the sick. The
[1:14:03] urine fleshing sea." That's God's
[1:14:05] eternal word.
[1:14:08] Now, the grace of God is so great in
[1:14:10] this day. I Yeah, I know I keep
[1:14:12] referring back to it, but to me, it was
[1:14:13] such a milestone camp we had. We live in
[1:14:15] a season of grace.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this and this season's never
[1:14:20] going to come to an end. And I think
[1:14:22] brother Isaac mentioned it um la couple
[1:14:25] of Wednesdays ago when he's you know
[1:14:26] when he mentioned about Enoch. Now this
[1:14:28] is how great now this is the grace that
[1:14:31] was upon your type your shadow right
[1:14:34] remember you're the reality Enoch the
[1:14:36] seventh from Adam was pointing to you
[1:14:38] the bride of Jesus Christ in this last
[1:14:40] day. You think about here Enoch walked
[1:14:42] with God we know and he was not cuz God
[1:14:44] took him. I was trying to find a picture
[1:14:46] and that was kind of it. But you know
[1:14:47] Enoch had his ups and downs. He had his
[1:14:50] family struggles. He had his own
[1:14:52] personal struggles. He was human. He
[1:14:54] wasn't devoid of of of any temptation.
[1:14:57] He was a real person living a real life.
[1:15:00] It wasn't some idyllic picnic picnic
[1:15:02] every day. Right? But the thing is God's
[1:15:05] grace was so great. Now in that day,
[1:15:08] there was nothing in existence that
[1:15:11] could actually change his body. Right?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; There wasn't even the blood of bulls and
[1:15:16] goats by Moses' law. And even even uh
[1:15:19] Paul would say that death never leth
[1:15:22] reigned from Adam to Moses. So death was
[1:15:25] reigning until Moses in the law. Okay.
[1:15:28] So so so death had complete control. Now
[1:15:31] in this time of death having complete
[1:15:33] control, there was a man walking with
[1:15:35] God. This is how GREAT THE GRACE OF GOD
[1:15:37] IS. You think about there was nothing
[1:15:39] there that could change change Enoch,
[1:15:42] right? But you see the grace of God was
[1:15:44] so great in his life. There was no BLOOD
[1:15:46] OF JESUS CHRIST. There was no perfect
[1:15:48] atonement. There was nothing there. But
[1:15:50] yet God's grace was so great in his
[1:15:52] life. He said, "Look, Enoch, in this
[1:15:53] time when death is reigning, I'm going
[1:15:55] to take you off the earth." Amen. And he
[1:15:58] began to walk with God. Remember, he
[1:15:59] lived 365 years. The first 65, he wasn't
[1:16:03] walking with God. But then God
[1:16:04] interrupted his own plans.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Interrupted Enoch's plans. And God
[1:16:08] started walking with Enoch, right? And
[1:16:11] God start Yeah. Enoch started walking
[1:16:12] with God. And then what happened is one
[1:16:14] day you know God you know Enoch start
[1:16:16] you know walked so far with God he just
[1:16:18] walked all the way home with God. Amen.
[1:16:20] So so in a time when death was reigning.
[1:16:23] Amen. God took Enoch off the earth.
[1:16:26] Amen. Now if God could do that with a
[1:16:28] person where where death was reigning.
[1:16:30] Amen. How much more a people now now we
[1:16:32] know death is riding. The fourth seal is
[1:16:35] in manifestation. We know Satan becomes
[1:16:37] incarnate in a man when the bride goes
[1:16:39] up. Right? But that last horse ride is
[1:16:41] death. We're living in a time of
[1:16:43] spiritual death. It's on the whole
[1:16:45] world. Amen. We're living in a time of
[1:16:47] death like there's never been. But yet
[1:16:49] in this season when death is here, amen,
[1:16:52] there's a people that the life of God
[1:16:53] has taken control of. Amen. And the
[1:16:56] blood of Jesus Christ has become so
[1:16:58] real. Amen. It's true power is coming to
[1:17:00] full manifestation. Amen. Why?
[1:17:02] Hallelujah. Why? Because God wants to
[1:17:04] show this is how great my grace is.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's why be of be of good courage this
[1:17:09] morning.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. If a man can go to heaven and then
[1:17:12] your death is raining, how much more are
[1:17:14] people under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:16] living in a season when death is riding?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:17:24] we must realize that every divine
[1:17:26] promise of God is ours by God's
[1:17:28] quickening power. Every promise. Amen.
[1:17:32] So, just like as Joshua was told by this
[1:17:35] sign, by the priest going in the Jordan
[1:17:37] parting, you're going to take every
[1:17:39] promise. And by the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:41] Ghost, that God's quickening power.
[1:17:43] Amen. It gives you every promise on God
[1:17:46] in God's word. I'm just going to read
[1:17:48] this. I like it. Now watch them. It was
[1:17:49] also designed to give them after this
[1:17:51] abstract. It was designed to give them
[1:17:54] every promise that was on the grounds.
[1:17:56] Every promise on the grounds of God's
[1:17:58] word that was promised in the Bible,
[1:18:00] that quickening power was give to them.
[1:18:03] I mean, to quicken that promise. And
[1:18:05] therefore, they laid hands on the sick
[1:18:06] and they was healed. They spoke in new
[1:18:08] tongues. They done great signs and
[1:18:10] wonders because that was in God's
[1:18:11] promise. And when Jesus died to redeem
[1:18:14] them uh redeem that back to them, the
[1:18:16] grounds that belong to sons of God, he
[1:18:19] demonstrated what God was. He says, "How
[1:18:21] dare we socialize that and put it into
[1:18:23] an organization we have no rights to do
[1:18:26] that." It's the Holy Spirit today is
[1:18:28] hunting out honest hearts that will
[1:18:30] believe that message.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at a room of
[1:18:33] honest hearts. Everything in the Bible
[1:18:35] that was promised, amen, is to that
[1:18:38] believer. And when you accept it in its
[1:18:40] fullness and God knows you'll do it, he
[1:18:42] gives you the abstract to it. And then
[1:18:44] every promise that's made is in your
[1:18:47] possession. And the Holy Spirit is there
[1:18:48] to quicken that to you.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Every promise,
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; healing,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; deliverance.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sanctified life, overcoming power.
[1:19:02] Amen. EVERY EVERY PROMISE THE BODY
[1:19:04] change is yours. AMEN. PRODIGS COMING
[1:19:07] HOME IS YOURS. AMEN. Sickness being
[1:19:09] healed, deliverance, demon spirits
[1:19:11] going, complex is going.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you would walk in joy. Amen.
[1:19:16] The fruit of the spirit would be in
[1:19:17] bloom in your life. Amen. The full
[1:19:19] restoration of the church be manifested
[1:19:21] in you. Amen. Every divine promise that
[1:19:24] God has given, he's quickened it to you.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; We should be of good courage this
[1:19:30] morning. It's all ours.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Did you earn it? No. He just gave it to
[1:19:34] me.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Well, what did you do? I didn't do
[1:19:36] anything. I was doing the opposite.
[1:19:38] Actually,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I was his enemy.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; We were his enemies, right?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Then one day, he came and he died for
[1:19:45] you and I.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; His holy spirit is here.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. To give it all. Oh my. What kind
[1:19:49] of people should we be? How wonderful to
[1:19:51] see God's great Holy Spirit here to do
[1:19:53] that power. Think of it. When the Holy
[1:19:55] Spirit itself here to bear record of
[1:19:57] this hour, Jesus said so. He's the same
[1:19:59] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can be of good courage that
[1:20:04] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:20:07] God in Christ Jesus.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing can separate us.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just, you know, I just want to
[1:20:13] go through a few more things if you'll
[1:20:14] give me a bit more time.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, see, Paul would come to a
[1:20:18] place that knowing all things, we're
[1:20:19] more than conquerors through him that
[1:20:21] loved us. He says, "For I am persuaded."
[1:20:24] What persuaded him? God proving his word
[1:20:27] in his life. Revelation persuaded him
[1:20:30] that neither death nor life, nor angels,
[1:20:32] nor principalities, nor powers, nor
[1:20:34] things present, nor things to come, nor
[1:20:36] height, nor depth, nor any creature
[1:20:38] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:20:39] love of God which is in Jesus Christ our
[1:20:42] Lord. Amen. So there's nothing in
[1:20:44] existence
[1:20:46] can separate us from the love of Jesus
[1:20:48] Christ. Amen. So why would we fear
[1:20:50] anything? We don't need to fear nothing.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Even it says in Isaiah that
[1:20:56] no weapon that's formed against you
[1:20:57] shall prosper. Doesn't matter how fancy
[1:20:59] that weapon is. Doesn't matter how good
[1:21:01] it is. It doesn't matter how long it's
[1:21:03] been forged in the depths of hell to
[1:21:05] take you out. Amen. I tell you what, if
[1:21:07] the devil could have taken you out, he
[1:21:08] would have done it a long time ago.
[1:21:10] Amen. He would have stopped you even
[1:21:12] coming to the earth if he could have.
[1:21:14] But he couldn't. I mean, he could have
[1:21:15] taken you as a child if he could have.
[1:21:17] But he couldn't. Why? Because God had a
[1:21:19] purpose for you. Amen. And nothing can
[1:21:21] take our lives until God's purpose is
[1:21:23] fulfilled. Amen. So therefore, no weapon
[1:21:26] formed against us shall prosper.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's a pretty big gun.
[1:21:30] It ain't going to work. It ain't going
[1:21:32] to prosper." Amen. No. Cuz God God is
[1:21:36] determined.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; He's more determined than you and I.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; He will have a people that's victorious
[1:21:41] every day. Amen. that live an overcoming
[1:21:44] life Sunday to Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
[1:21:47] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[1:21:48] Sunday, and all over again, they'll live
[1:21:50] a victorious overcoming life. And it
[1:21:53] doesn't matter what the devil can throw
[1:21:54] against them, they'll still love the
[1:21:56] Lord.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says that a man can
[1:21:58] be so surrendered to God that the devil
[1:22:00] doesn't even know what to do with him.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; He'll bring out every trick in trick in
[1:22:04] his bag
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; and he'll just then he'll just come to a
[1:22:08] point there's nothing I can bring out of
[1:22:09] this thing that can derail this guy.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Temptation fails, pride fails,
[1:22:15] religious spirit fails, false doctrine
[1:22:18] fails. Amen. Pride, you know,
[1:22:21] selfishness fails, lust fails,
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; unforgiveness fails, sickness fails,
[1:22:28] hardship fails, hunger fails, all those
[1:22:31] everything he tries to bring, they just
[1:22:33] fail. Why? Because that person is so
[1:22:35] surrendered to God. And the devil comes
[1:22:37] to play says, "I just don't know what to
[1:22:38] do with this guy. I've tried. I've sent
[1:22:41] my best. I've done my worst. And he just
[1:22:44] gets back up. Says, "Thank you, Jesus,
[1:22:46] for another day."
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, we must not be
[1:22:53] afraid of anything.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing in this land we should be afraid
[1:22:57] of. The giants in that land, they're
[1:23:00] bred for us. I mean, every problem. See,
[1:23:03] people Yeah. I know we're talking about
[1:23:05] this home at two, but you know this at
[1:23:07] home as well, but you know, people are
[1:23:08] afraid that a that a that a strong
[1:23:10] delusion can take out the bride of Jesus
[1:23:12] Christ. Yeah. Yeah. Because the devil
[1:23:15] wants to put something out there and and
[1:23:17] fear gives it power. I ain't afraid of a
[1:23:20] religious spirit.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; I ain't afraid of false doctrine. I
[1:23:23] ain't afraid of some some some lukewarm
[1:23:26] spirit trying to take me out. I'm not
[1:23:29] afraid of it
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; because our Lord Jesus said, he said,
[1:23:34] "For there shall arise false Christ,
[1:23:35] false prophets, and there shall and
[1:23:37] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:23:40] much that if it were possible," in other
[1:23:42] words, it's not possible, they shall
[1:23:44] deceive the very elect. Amen. So, he
[1:23:47] said, "If it was possible, they would
[1:23:49] deceive the very elect." But it's not
[1:23:50] possible.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because my sheep know my
[1:23:54] voice.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY SHEEP KNOW my voice. say, "I
[1:23:58] know them by name." I mean, they will
[1:24:00] not follow a stranger. They run from
[1:24:02] that thing. There's something within
[1:24:04] them that goes off. Say, "This is not
[1:24:06] me."
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; If you've got the Holy Ghost, you've got
[1:24:08] a you've got a warning system within you
[1:24:11] and it even if it can sound so good and
[1:24:14] so right and so reasonable, there's
[1:24:16] something in you saying that's not the
[1:24:17] Lord.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; That's not the voice of my shepherd.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore because of that
[1:24:22] confidence that we should have as
[1:24:23] brother Isaac preached WE SHOULD HAVE
[1:24:24] SUCH CONFIDENCE we can never be
[1:24:26] deceived.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; What do we have to fear?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; We don't need to fear anything. Oh yeah
[1:24:32] but this and this. And I think that we
[1:24:34] have come to an end of a season of
[1:24:36] preaching. Be careful. You'll be taken.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I've already been taken. Not by a strong
[1:24:41] delusion. I've been taken by almighty
[1:24:43] God. Amen. He I am in his hands. Amen.
[1:24:46] He I am his. I'VE ALREADY BEEN GOT. SO
[1:24:50] WHY SHOULD I BE CAREFUL BEING GONE BY
[1:24:51] SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S WEAKER, THAT'S
[1:24:53] INFERIOR, that's going to burn, THAT'S
[1:24:55] NOTHING BUT A CHEAP COPY WHEN the real,
[1:24:58] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, THE GOD
[1:25:00] OF THE WORD, HAS GOT A HOLD OF my life
[1:25:02] and I've become a love prisoner to him.
[1:25:04] I don't need to fear nothing. We can
[1:25:07] walk in confidence. We can have good
[1:25:08] courage.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to be afraid of
[1:25:11] anything. Oh, but it'll get you at the
[1:25:13] end. I'm not walking like my life is a
[1:25:16] slow train wreck. We're not in some slow
[1:25:19] motion explosion like a there's a bomb
[1:25:21] and it's counting down and we can't put
[1:25:23] it out. We don't live like that.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; No, we're going to walk victorious out
[1:25:28] of this world.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; We're overcomers this morning.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, but that's so but the devil, you
[1:25:34] know, it's strong delusion.
[1:25:37] Our God stronger.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Are God stronger?
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:25:43] that's in the world. Greater. Not equal,
[1:25:45] NOT CLOSE TO, NOT MATCHING. NO, GREATER.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that greater means greater,
[1:25:50] larger, elder, and stronger. Amen. God
[1:25:53] is well, yeah, God is elder than the
[1:25:54] devil. He was here before the devil. And
[1:25:56] he'll be here after the devil. Like I
[1:25:58] was here before the devil. I'll be here
[1:26:00] after the devil. Amen. I'll be here when
[1:26:02] the devil's not even a memory. I mean,
[1:26:03] we won't talk about him. WE WON'T THINK
[1:26:05] ABOUT HIM. WE WON'T BE PLAGUED by him.
[1:26:07] He'll be burning. He'll be nothing. You
[1:26:09] won't be able to find a single speck of
[1:26:11] that guy.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, we will be in
[1:26:13] eternal bodies. Amen. Rejoicing around
[1:26:15] the throne of God.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So our God is greater, larger,
[1:26:19] elder, and stronger.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Greater is he that's in you than
[1:26:24] he that's in the world.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. My sheep hear my voice.
[1:26:28] I know them and they follow me.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; God does not say they might know my
[1:26:33] voice and they might follow me. He never
[1:26:35] said that. No, they know my voice.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to sit there and
[1:26:39] say, "Is that God or is that not God? My
[1:26:41] sheep know my voice. If if something's
[1:26:44] talking to you and you have to work out
[1:26:45] it's God or not, odds are it's not.
[1:26:48] Right? He's he's not the author of
[1:26:50] confusion. We're not led by random
[1:26:53] happen stance signs and things. God is
[1:26:56] concrete and he proves himself. And you
[1:26:58] can know it's God because you can look
[1:27:00] back and say, "He's led me into his word
[1:27:01] further." That's how we know it's him.
[1:27:03] So we don't have to guess nothing. He
[1:27:05] tells us clearly.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Well, what if my ear's not open? Are you
[1:27:08] his?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And what if I miss it? He'll he'll
[1:27:12] repeat it again.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; He He'll repeat it until you get it cuz
[1:27:16] he wants you to get it. Remember, he's
[1:27:18] determined. He doesn't get frustrated.
[1:27:20] He doesn't say, "Oh, that guy's just
[1:27:22] deaf." No. We've been given ears to hear
[1:27:24] and hearts to receive. We're made that
[1:27:26] way. We don't become that way. We're
[1:27:29] made that way. That's why when the
[1:27:30] message came your way, when God's voice
[1:27:33] to this age came your way, something in
[1:27:34] you says, "Well, I hear that." And then
[1:27:37] you begin to change your while you let
[1:27:38] God change your life according to that
[1:27:40] voice.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I give unto them eternal life
[1:27:45] and they shall never perish. Neither
[1:27:47] shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; You can't. Who's ever tried as a kid?
[1:27:52] You try and get something out of like
[1:27:53] your dad's hand. Someone who's strong
[1:27:55] and you try all your might. You're
[1:27:56] hanging off his arm and you know, but
[1:27:59] there's nothing moving there.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Who's tried that?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; That's like the devil. He tries to get
[1:28:03] you out of God's hand and God just, he
[1:28:06] doesn't even have to, you know, flex
[1:28:07] hard. He just kind of holds you. He's
[1:28:10] not worried about the devil and his
[1:28:12] schemes. We get all worried and, you
[1:28:13] know, the devil's doing this and all
[1:28:14] these things. No, but God has you in his
[1:28:16] hands.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Everything's okay. We can just rest.
[1:28:20] Amen. My neither shall any man pluck
[1:28:23] them. And that doesn't mean we're blas.
[1:28:25] I'm not being blas, right? We have
[1:28:27] confidence. We have good courage. Our
[1:28:30] God is in control. like when he came
[1:28:32] down to Joshua after they crossed
[1:28:34] Jordan. He came down as a captain of the
[1:28:36] host of the Lord and and and Joshua
[1:28:38] draws his sorties and he says, "Are you
[1:28:40] for me, for us, or for our adversaries?"
[1:28:43] And and and and God just says, "I'm
[1:28:45] neither. I'm here to take over.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; I come as the captain of the host of the
[1:28:49] Lord." Amen. So, he basically said,
[1:28:51] Joshua, I'm here to take this whole
[1:28:52] campaign. I told you that YOU'RE GOING
[1:28:54] TO PLACE him in the land, but I'm going
[1:28:56] to lead you as you place him in the
[1:28:57] land. Amen. It wasn't just for Jericho.
[1:29:00] It was for the whole campaign. Amen. SO
[1:29:02] THE MIGHTY ANGEL STEPS DOWN INTO YOUR
[1:29:04] LIFE WHICH IS CHRIST AND HE'S GOING TO
[1:29:06] TAKE YOU TO the fullness of adoption to
[1:29:08] the change of the body and you're going
[1:29:09] to get every single promise from there
[1:29:11] to here. You know I was I was you know
[1:29:13] with Christine in the supermarket and
[1:29:15] you know it's like okay we're just going
[1:29:16] in for milk next minute.
[1:29:21] But I was thinking about this. I thought
[1:29:22] I thought this is how we should be as
[1:29:24] Christians. You know you're like you see
[1:29:27] a promise in the word and okay. So, I
[1:29:30] need I need some peace. I need some joy.
[1:29:33] You know, there's something like or
[1:29:34] healing or something. Right now, men, we
[1:29:37] just go like this and we're just after
[1:29:38] that. Why not pick up a whole bunch of
[1:29:40] blessings on the way?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Why not have a trolley full? You with
[1:29:45] me? Amen. You see, men be, oh, yeah,
[1:29:48] there's some healing here. There's, you
[1:29:49] know, there's some answered prayer.
[1:29:50] There's, you know, all these promises.
[1:29:51] There's a joy. There's some revelation.
[1:29:53] We just like this. No, I need this one.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Why not just pick it all up?
[1:29:58] Why not just look around as you're going
[1:30:00] towards that promise that's been
[1:30:01] revealed that it's yours? Why not look
[1:30:03] around as you're walking down that aisle
[1:30:05] and pick it all up?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; As brother Collins just said, it's all
[1:30:08] been paid for anyway.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; You don't need to walk through a
[1:30:11] checkout. You can be one of those
[1:30:12] shoplifting people who just walk the
[1:30:13] whole trolley out and you don't need to
[1:30:15] feel bad about it. You don't have to
[1:30:16] make any excuses.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; You don't do that in the natural. That's
[1:30:22] wrong.
[1:30:24] Okay. But in the spiritual, why not?
[1:30:26] Shouldn't we be Shouldn't we go shopping
[1:30:28] like that?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get it all. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:33] Now, on this, I was actually in the
[1:30:36] supermarket thinking about this.
[1:30:39] There's another time.
[1:30:41] God showed Brother Brandon when he was
[1:30:43] 2/3 to the Jordan.
[1:30:46] There's a ma, there's a snake
[1:30:48] represented death on the path, right?
[1:30:50] And it was after one of his friends and
[1:30:53] he was crying out saying, "God, have
[1:30:54] mercy on my brother." because he's
[1:30:56] trying to strike him and he and he knew
[1:30:58] that if that snake struck him, he'd be
[1:30:59] dead, right? And then and then that
[1:31:01] snake turned and tried to get brother
[1:31:03] Brandham and it said that that snake as
[1:31:05] he got closer to him, he just kind of
[1:31:07] slowed down and stopped. He couldn't he
[1:31:09] couldn't strike the prophet. And why is
[1:31:11] that? Because God was in him.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how intimidating the
[1:31:16] devil is, he can't get you.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Right? If you're sealed into the day of
[1:31:20] your redemption, he can't get you.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; He can't break that seal. I'm not going
[1:31:24] to throw a bottle around. David's not
[1:31:26] here, so I'm not going to do that this
[1:31:27] this Sunday. But you see, he can't get
[1:31:29] you.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; He can hiss up. He can rear up and all
[1:31:32] those kind of things. He can try and
[1:31:33] intimidate you. You got to realize this
[1:31:36] thing has to obey my voice.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You got a troubled mind. It's got to
[1:31:40] obey your voice. You're you're anxious
[1:31:43] this morning. You're full of stress and
[1:31:45] pressure. That thing's got to obey you.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to let that thing
[1:31:50] anxiety and stress and oh, it's the you
[1:31:52] know, it's the Christmas season. got to
[1:31:53] run around and stress and all these
[1:31:55] things. You don't have to be stressed
[1:31:56] doing it. You don't have to be anxious
[1:31:58] for nothing. Amen. You can rest in all
[1:32:01] things. But you see, we we don't need to
[1:32:04] be intimidated by those things.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So then a voice came. That serpent
[1:32:08] came against him. He said, "And a voice
[1:32:10] came from from from above me." He said,
[1:32:12] "You have been given power to bind him,
[1:32:14] the worst or any."
[1:32:17] Amen. And then of course he you know,
[1:32:19] brother asked the question, "What must I
[1:32:21] do?" He says, "There's one thing you
[1:32:22] must do. You must be more sincere. You
[1:32:25] must be more sincere. And he prayed.
[1:32:27] Said, "Lord, make me more sincere.
[1:32:28] Forgive me, Lord. Make me more sincere."
[1:32:30] He said he felt the power come into his
[1:32:32] life. And that thing tried to get him.
[1:32:34] He says, "I bind you in the name of the
[1:32:35] Lord Jesus Christ." The life went out of
[1:32:37] it. Turned like an turned into like an
[1:32:38] ant sign like glass. He said he mashed
[1:32:40] on a little bit to see and then he he
[1:32:42] said, "Now to see if I can, I loose you
[1:32:44] and the life came back and then you know
[1:32:46] then I bind you." We all know the story,
[1:32:48] right?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; That power is in you. Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; You have the power to bind or loose.
[1:32:55] There's life and death is in the power
[1:32:56] of the tongue. Amen. And if that's just
[1:32:59] even just a natural person, a natural
[1:33:01] person's words can hurt or can heal. How
[1:33:03] much more someone who's anointed with
[1:33:05] God. Amen. That God can speak through
[1:33:07] their lips. Amen. That power is within
[1:33:09] you. And God, remember, God wants to
[1:33:11] prove that
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; That you have power to bind the worst or
[1:33:17] any. Yeah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; What do we have to be afraid of?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, do I have to kind of do
[1:33:24] something and work it out?" No, no. You
[1:33:26] step into it,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; God anoints it, and he just takes over.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Like William was watching a Bible story,
[1:33:33] like a Lego Bible story. Daniel being
[1:33:34] thrown into the lion's den this morning.
[1:33:36] It's all dramatic. It's all stretched
[1:33:38] out and all these lines. It's all, you
[1:33:41] know, you know, to grip their attention.
[1:33:43] And I was looking at that, you know,
[1:33:44] with Christina. I said, "Now, it
[1:33:46] wouldn't have been like that at all.
[1:33:47] Just would have been." and and she said,
[1:33:48] "Yeah, it would have been so normal. He
[1:33:50] would have been put into the den. The
[1:33:53] anointing would have come down. Those
[1:33:55] lines just would have sat down been may
[1:33:57] maybe he would have tickled them or rode
[1:33:58] them around or it just wouldn't perfect
[1:34:00] peace.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; But it wouldn't have been like this.
[1:34:02] Probably at first he's like, man, well,
[1:34:04] this is the end, I guess.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; But then when God when the angel Lord
[1:34:07] came down and took over everything,
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; it would have been just normal.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But then when he came out of the den, he
[1:34:14] would have realized, man, that was
[1:34:15] something. Yes.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; But you see, he didn't call the angel
[1:34:18] into the den.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; God stepped in to prove his word.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Right? And it's the same thing with you
[1:34:23] and I. We step into situations like, you
[1:34:26] know, we all know Christine's testimony
[1:34:27] would being, you know, I said, "That's
[1:34:29] just like you being surrounded by the
[1:34:31] three or four men and the dog on the
[1:34:32] path there when you, you know, before we
[1:34:34] were married." I said, "The den was just
[1:34:37] like that."
[1:34:39] She she realized I'm in trouble when
[1:34:41] they surrounded her on that path. But
[1:34:42] then the anointing came down. The angel,
[1:34:44] the same angel that came into the den
[1:34:46] came onto the path
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; and she realized they can't touch me
[1:34:48] because I've got uncut hair and God's
[1:34:51] given me angelic protection because of
[1:34:52] that.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; And then what happened? They all froze.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; She pushed the dog out of the way and
[1:34:58] then started running walking down the
[1:34:59] path and ran home. But then when that
[1:35:01] all finished, she realized the magnitude
[1:35:02] of what happened, right? It would have
[1:35:04] been like that with Daniel. So many
[1:35:07] times you think about, well, what's
[1:35:08] going to happen when when these things
[1:35:10] and I can bind and loose? It'll just be
[1:35:12] another part of your day if I can put it
[1:35:14] that way. Cuz the anointing comes and
[1:35:16] takes over your life.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; So we can rest in all things,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; right? Just like the marts going to the
[1:35:24] stake. You say, "How on earth could they
[1:35:26] do that?" They're anointed to do it,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; right? Didn't matter what they were
[1:35:30] feeling beforehand, but during that
[1:35:32] whole process, they were like, "I'm
[1:35:34] here, Lord.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to see him soon." And God
[1:35:39] anointed them to overcome.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; But maybe thinking about it beforehand,
[1:35:43] after you think, man, how could I do
[1:35:44] that? How could that ever, you know,
[1:35:46] transpire? And how could you ever stand
[1:35:47] like that? It's because the anointing
[1:35:48] was there
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; and carried them through. And brother
[1:35:51] Ram says that that same faith they had
[1:35:54] to overcome is the same faith we daily
[1:35:56] overcome with.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:36:03] finish with this these two quotes. Maybe
[1:36:05] we'll have the musicians up, please, and
[1:36:06] I'll just read these two quotes. We'll
[1:36:07] be done. We can have courage this
[1:36:10] morning. We face a defeated foe.
[1:36:14] Watch what he did. This is our Lord
[1:36:16] Jesus. When he was on earth, he
[1:36:17] conquered and possessed every gate the
[1:36:19] enemy had. The royal seed, he promised
[1:36:21] it by the word. He conquered it. He
[1:36:24] conquered the gate of sickness for us.
[1:36:26] That's what he come to do. Remember,
[1:36:28] sick people, he conquered that gate. You
[1:36:29] don't have to conquer it. He conquered
[1:36:31] it.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The other men had to conquer their
[1:36:35] own gate. But you don't have to conquer.
[1:36:36] It's already conquered. He conquered the
[1:36:38] gates of sickness. And what did he do
[1:36:41] when he conquered the gates of sickness?
[1:36:42] Saying what he would, pardon me,
[1:36:44] whatsoever you ask on earth, whatsoever
[1:36:46] you bound on earth, I'll he'll bind in
[1:36:48] heaven. Give us the keys to the gate. He
[1:36:52] conquered the gate of temptation by the
[1:36:53] word. And the keys was resist the enemy
[1:36:55] and he'll flee from you. He conquered it
[1:36:57] all. Conquered every sickness, conquered
[1:36:59] death. He conquered hell. He conquered
[1:37:01] death and hell. He conquered what others
[1:37:03] couldn't conquer because they're of the
[1:37:05] natural seed. This is the spiritual
[1:37:07] seed. He conquered the gate of the grave
[1:37:09] and rose up on the third day for our
[1:37:11] justification. And now we are more than
[1:37:14] conquerors. We just walk right into it
[1:37:16] as an inheritance. More than conquerors.
[1:37:18] Now we are dealing with a defeated
[1:37:20] enemy. Sickness is defeated. Death is
[1:37:22] defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything's
[1:37:24] defeated. Oh my. Wish I was twice my
[1:37:27] size. Now I'd feel twice as good. We are
[1:37:29] disputing with a conquered enemy.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; That's who you're disputing with this
[1:37:34] morning. He's already been conquered.
[1:37:36] He's already been whipped. You don't
[1:37:37] have to whip him. He's already been
[1:37:39] whipped for you.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, when the enemy comes and and
[1:37:42] tries to make you think it's a hopeless
[1:37:45] case and tries to make you dismayed and
[1:37:47] looked at the negative and what's the
[1:37:48] point of trying and what's the point of
[1:37:50] living anymore and all these things,
[1:37:52] that's a conquered foe talking to you.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; So, let's be of good courage this
[1:37:58] morning.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; We're going to take it all
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; and then we'll go see him.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you, friends. Let's
[1:38:05] stand this morning.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I guess we got to sing
[1:38:13] that song. Why would I be worried when
[1:38:15] giants come calling my name?
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:19] [snorts]
[1:38:30] Why would I worry when giants come
[1:38:33] calling my name? [singing]
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my God is so much bigger than the
[1:38:43] problems I faced.
[1:38:48] Why would I hunger for power or riches
[1:38:53] or faith?
[1:38:57] Oh my God is so much better than all
[1:39:01] [music] of these things.
[1:39:06] I won't be [music and singing] shen.
[1:39:10] No, I won't be moved.
[1:39:15] My God [music and singing] is faithful.
[1:39:19] His promise is true. [music]
[1:39:24] I speak to the mountain. [music]
[1:39:28] Oh, [singing] it's time.
[1:39:33] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:39:38] greater than you.
[1:39:44] I am scattered cuz they [music] know the
[1:39:47] battle is [singing] done.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my God is stronger.
[1:39:55] [music and singing] The victory already
[1:39:58] won.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; He died for my ransom and rose up on the
[1:40:06] third day. [music]
[1:40:11] Well, my God is greater [music] than the
[1:40:13] earth
[1:40:15] and the earth.
[1:40:18] [music]
[1:40:19] I won't be [singing] shen.
[1:40:24] I won't feel.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; My God [music and singing] is faithful.
[1:40:32] His promise [music] is true.
[1:40:37] Cross to the mountains
[1:40:43] of
[1:40:46] my God is bigger, [music] better,
[1:40:50] stronger, greater than you.
[1:40:57] There's no [music and singing] mountain
[1:40:59] to hide, no valley to go. There's no
[1:41:02] fear that [singing] I have. He doesn't
[1:41:05] already [music] know. There's no problem
[1:41:08] too big. There's no weapon too strong.
[1:41:11] There is [music and singing] nothing for
[1:41:13] God that's impossible.
[1:41:16] There's no mountain to high, [singing]
[1:41:18] no to. [music]
[1:41:20] There's no I am. He doesn't know.
[1:41:25] There's no promise to do. There's no
[1:41:28] record to show. There
[1:41:30] [music and singing] is nothing for
[1:41:32] that's impossible.
[1:41:37] So I [music] won't be shen.
[1:41:42] I [singing and music] won't be hurt.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I won't be hurt.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; My God is faithful.
[1:41:49] [music]
[1:41:50] His promise [singing] is true.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; My God is big, big, stronger, greater.
[1:42:13] Amen.
[1:42:15] Praise the Lord. What's your mountain
[1:42:17] this morning? What's your What's your
[1:42:20] Amalachite? What's your Amorite? What's
[1:42:22] the What's the thing that you wrestle
[1:42:24] with? Why don't you let God deal with it
[1:42:26] this morning? Amen. We're here to
[1:42:29] possess every promise. Every part of the
[1:42:31] word is ours. There's nothing that
[1:42:33] should hinder us. There's nothing that
[1:42:34] can if you surrender all. Let God take
[1:42:36] control. Amen. So, let's let's bow our
[1:42:39] heads this morning. Just want to let's

[1:42:52] image of the priest standing in Jordan
[1:42:53] with the ark. Lord, you said to Joshua
[1:42:56] that by this you know that without fail
[1:42:59] you'll take the whole land. Hallelujah.
[1:43:01] Lord God, that came into manifestation.
[1:43:03] Lord, that was their sign. They're going
[1:43:05] to take it all, Lord Jesus. And father,
[1:43:08] Lord, when we receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:43:09] when we cross that Jordan, that death to
[1:43:11] self, that's a sign we're going to get.
[1:43:13] Every promise, Lord, every part of the
[1:43:15] promised land, every part of our
[1:43:16] inheritance is ours. We thank you for
[1:43:18] this, my God. I pray we'd take courage
[1:43:20] this morning, Lord. May you strengthen
[1:43:22] the feeble knees, Lord. Lift up the
[1:43:24] hands that hang down. Dear God, may
[1:43:26] there just be such a courage from
[1:43:27] almighty from almighty God, Lord, from
[1:43:29] you into our lives, Lord Jesus, that we
[1:43:31] don't need to be dismayed or fearful
[1:43:33] that we can press the battle like never
[1:43:34] before, knowing in whom we have
[1:43:36] believed, Lord, knowing you, Lord, that
[1:43:38] you have conquered hell, death, and the
[1:43:40] grave. You have conquered it all for us,
[1:43:41] Lord. Just want to go forward and
[1:43:43] possess it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:45] So, Father, I pray you'd touch everyone
[1:43:47] here. Bless each one, dear God. Those
[1:43:48] who are streaming as well. Father, may
[1:43:50] there be such a confidence, such a
[1:43:52] courage in our hearts like never before
[1:43:54] because this is the season where we will
[1:43:56] possess every divine promise, all of our
[1:43:59] inheritance in you. We thank you, Lord.
[1:44:01] We have the great privilege of living in
[1:44:03] this season, Lord. We're not looking for
[1:44:05] one day someone will come and do it.
[1:44:07] Lord, we say thank you, Lord. You've
[1:44:08] placed us here, Lord God, that we can
[1:44:10] enjoy all that you are. We love you so
[1:44:13] much and thank you in Jesus Christ's
[1:44:14] name. Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. My last

[1:44:25] song? Um, we are able to go up and take
[1:44:26] the country. Knows that one. I think
[1:44:29] it's F. We are able to [music] go up and
[1:44:32] take the country
[1:44:35] to possess the land [music] from Jordan
[1:44:38] to the sea.
[1:44:40] Though the giants [music] may be there
[1:44:43] our way to him,
[1:44:46] God will surely [singing] give us
[1:44:48] victory.
[1:44:51] Jes

[1:44:57] in the house of the savior [music]
[1:45:02] son of God.
[1:45:07] [music]
[1:45:08] Jesus is the same
[1:45:13] son of God.
[1:45:16] [music]
[1:45:18] We are more than conquerors in his name.
