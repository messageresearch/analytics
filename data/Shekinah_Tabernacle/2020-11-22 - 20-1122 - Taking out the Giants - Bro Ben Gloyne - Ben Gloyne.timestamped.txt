[26:01] um just sitting there
[26:04] on the chair and i realized that i'm
[26:06] very privileged
[26:08] i'm privileged to be called the son of
[26:10] god amen
[26:12] amen i'm privileged to
[26:15] for god who made the universe and
[26:18] everything
[26:20] to think about me of all the people to
[26:24] choose me
[26:24] so that is the privilege that
[26:28] i pray that is in your heart and you are
[26:30] realizing it this morning
[26:32] you know the power of the revelation of
[26:34] your privilege my privilege
[26:36] so it doesn't matter that doesn't matter
[26:39] what the devil
[26:41] can do doesn't matter
[26:44] to a point where paul says actually paul
[26:47] said what can separate us from the love
[26:49] of god
[26:50] nothing nothing what the devil does or
[26:53] does not
[26:53] do nothing can separate us from the love
[26:56] of god this morning
[26:58] so that's a great privilege because it
[27:00] doesn't matter
[27:01] what the devil does what matters is that
[27:04] he thought about
[27:05] you and me and the thought of life
[27:09] the thought of god is eternal hallelujah
[27:12] i want to sing this song
[27:15] um sister deborah i'm sorry miguel that
[27:20] someone dropped the ball and didn't want
[27:23] to come with me to
[27:24] help me um but
[27:28] if you can join him that would be
[27:30] wonderful
[27:32] there's a key that when i sing i break
[27:34] in the spirit
[27:35] and the devil attacks that key brother
[27:37] onions but there's a certain voice that
[27:39] when i use
[27:41] i break in the spirit and the devil has
[27:43] i think he picked it up
[27:45] and he attacks it so this morning
[27:49] i just want to tell him that he lost
[27:50] already
[27:54] life is easy
[27:59] when you are up in the mountains
[28:04] and you've got peace of mind
[28:07] like i've never known

[28:34] he still got in the valley
[28:40] when things go wrong
[28:45] he'll make them right
[28:50] and the god of the good
[28:53] times he's still got in the
[29:03] [Music]

[29:14] when we are up in the mountains

[41:25] want to get out of there get out of that
[41:27] wellington and that wild weather

[41:33] standing there with a with a guy with a
[41:35] colleague and uh he pressed the button
[41:38] to go to the ground floor i press the
[41:39] button to go to the first floor now the
[41:41] ground on the first in our building is
[41:42] the same
[41:44] and i get a different lift to him

[42:54] in this good times yes we've got a
[42:57] testimony
[42:58] yes mr melissa
[43:01] praise the lord
[43:17] i wanted to actually sing so i'll just
[43:19] say a testament
[43:23] i told the lord that i would do this if
[43:25] someone asked and
[43:27] we're starting right off with someone
[43:29] asking so
[43:30] oh okay um so
[43:34] about two weeks ago i moved
[43:38] please forgive me if i cry and
[43:42] it was a difficult space i've been in a
[43:45] difficult space for a while
[43:47] emotionally i've been like suffering
[43:50] with
[43:51] what we have now identified as
[43:53] depression
[43:55] and i started medication about three
[43:58] months ago
[43:59] and at camp i decided to stop my
[44:02] medication
[44:03] because i didn't want to be on it
[44:05] anymore i wanted to
[44:07] accept that i didn't need it and then
[44:10] two weeks later i moved but i think just
[44:13] stopping
[44:14] that medication straight was uh
[44:18] was a bit hard on my body and i my
[44:20] emotions were insane
[44:22] i had so many voices in my head
[44:25] and um i've physically have not been
[44:28] well either but
[44:29] just like every avenue that i could be
[44:32] attacked on i've
[44:33] been attacked on lately and um
[44:37] anyways i
[44:40] i i've got so much to say i'm sorry i
[44:45] i'll i hope that will come up here but
[44:48] um
[44:50] i got very very angry at my brothers and
[44:53] sisters well specifically my sisters
[44:56] because i had asked for help
[44:59] and no one was able to help me move that
[45:02] weekend
[45:03] and i was very in a lot of pain
[45:06] physically like my body was really
[45:08] really sore
[45:09] but the devil just puts everything in
[45:11] the perfect place
[45:13] to make you get angry
[45:17] for reasons that are actually not
[45:19] actually there like
[45:20] brother ben was saying another reality
[45:22] gets created so i was in this reality
[45:24] you know of
[45:25] feeling really angry and um
[45:28] i apologize i i left the brothers and
[45:31] sisters group
[45:32] and the sisters group because i was very
[45:35] angry
[45:36] and and i thought okay i
[45:40] can't actually pinpoint where my anger
[45:42] is or at
[45:43] who but i'm angry and that's just where
[45:46] i was and i thought
[45:47] i'm not going to rejoin because there's
[45:49] something in this
[45:51] and i just need to let the lord work
[45:53] through this
[45:54] and i've been in that space now since
[45:57] that happened
[45:58] and then this week um
[46:03] i i was busy driving i think it was
[46:06] tuesday wednesday
[46:08] and i started feeling that anger come
[46:10] again and i thought what
[46:11] i said why am i so angry what am i angry
[46:15] about so i thought
[46:16] and forgive me again but i started to
[46:19] think of each one of you
[46:20] and i thought if i'm angry with someone
[46:24] lord let me identify so i can go and
[46:26] speak to them and say i'm sorry i don't
[46:28] want feeling this way
[46:30] but i need to make it right you know i
[46:34] like with brother could be last week as
[46:36] well saying you know don't be angry with
[46:37] your brother or sister i was like but
[46:39] i'm angry but i don't know why and i
[46:41] don't know and who
[46:43] and anyways then um
[46:47] i kept saying i'm angry i'm angry and i
[46:49] was driving home from work
[46:51] and um i thought lord who so i started
[46:55] going through i saw each of your faces
[46:57] i was like going down a list you know
[46:59] like okay this was
[47:00] no it's just difference of opinion we're
[47:02] different people like i love that person
[47:04] the next person no but this i love that
[47:06] person like i could not find
[47:09] a single thing that i didn't love about
[47:12] every single one of you hey man and i
[47:14] thought well then what am i angry about
[47:16] omar all of a sudden
[47:20] i was like that's just freedom
[47:23] since you're not angry at your brothers
[47:25] and sisters
[47:26] you're sick and tired of the devil
[47:28] pushing you around
[47:30] right you're angry at him so stand up
[47:34] stop letting him push you around hey man
[47:41] and it was so good and i went and
[47:44] pulled the car over started singing this
[47:47] song which is the song i wanted to sing
[47:49] today and
[47:50] devil took my voice but
[47:53] i had a little jubilee all by myself in
[47:56] the car and it was so nice
[47:57] and sister junior i'm so sorry that i
[47:59] went off the group on your birthday
[48:01] there was not
[48:02] it had nothing but it's the boys you
[48:05] know like you get
[48:06] it had nothing to do with that it was my
[48:08] own reality that i was in
[48:10] and i apologize i wanted to do in a
[48:12] formal apology i do not want to just do
[48:14] say on the gribon sorry it was something
[48:17] that i was going through and i just
[48:19] needed the lord to take me through it
[48:21] and for encouragement
[48:25] we are all human we all make mistakes
[48:29] and we all have different cultures
[48:31] different perspectives that we
[48:34] bring to together yeah and we just need
[48:38] to
[48:38] always look because in every single one
[48:40] of us there's such
[48:42] beautiful a beautiful thing and that
[48:44] beautiful thing that connects us all
[48:46] with jesus and the love that we have for
[48:47] him
[48:48] and when you're angry place it in the
[48:51] right place and stomp the devil down and
[48:53] don't let him take control
[48:55] of your mind of your heart and
[48:59] let don't let him push you and pull you
[49:01] away from
[49:03] those that connect you and pull you
[49:04] closer to him
[49:06] and yeah that's destiny
[49:29] a there's a song that was playing in our
[49:30] house quite but
[49:32] uh this week is uh well according in my
[49:35] mind

[1:03:27] john
[1:03:29] you know it's been real nice um
[1:03:32] sometimes
[1:03:32] i get a thought late in the week but
[1:03:34] recently it's been i've i've been having
[1:03:36] a sunday on a monday so i'll be at work
[1:03:38] and
[1:03:39] and and this week's been a real week
[1:03:41] i've been literally the one one man band
[1:03:43] there's only three of us so you gotta
[1:03:45] you know i told my boss you know i'm
[1:03:47] gonna go join the circus and be a
[1:03:48] juggler they knew what i was meaning
[1:03:49] because i was trying to juggle
[1:03:50] everything
[1:03:51] but anyway the lord's good even in a
[1:03:52] busy situation and you know so i just
[1:03:54] started to write things down and
[1:03:55] have a good time so i had my sunday on a
[1:03:57] monday and anyway so
[1:03:59] you know we read here about a change in
[1:04:03] uh dispensation here where where the
[1:04:06] where a younger generation rises but i
[1:04:08] want you to notice that
[1:04:10] the beginning of this is when the past
[1:04:12] is buried
[1:04:13] now here we have saul now this is this
[1:04:16] is quite far into david's reign this is
[1:04:18] not when he first became king but
[1:04:20] you know there has to come a time where
[1:04:22] the failures of the past are buried in
[1:04:24] the right way
[1:04:25] where the discouragements the valleys
[1:04:27] the the
[1:04:28] the bits of your walk that you just
[1:04:29] really wish you could you never went
[1:04:31] there but you had to go there
[1:04:33] you're buried in the right way so what
[1:04:35] happened is with with
[1:04:36] um david i mean sorry jonathan and saul
[1:04:39] we know that they fell in the battle
[1:04:41] against the philistines and the
[1:04:42] philistines took them as trophies and
[1:04:44] hung their
[1:04:45] bodies up they cut their heads off put
[1:04:46] their bodies up in their cities and put
[1:04:48] um saul's armor in one of their temples
[1:04:51] and you know so
[1:04:52] but then what happened is some of the
[1:04:54] mighty men there of um
[1:04:56] of of a certain tribe and i think i have
[1:04:58] it here and once again forgive me for my
[1:05:00] slideshow uh and when the inhabitants of
[1:05:03] gabish gillie had heard of that which
[1:05:06] the philistines had done to saul which
[1:05:07] was
[1:05:08] find his body on the battlefield cut his
[1:05:09] head off take the bodies a trophy take
[1:05:11] the armor as a trophy
[1:05:13] all the valiant men arose and went all
[1:05:15] night and took the body of saul and of
[1:05:17] the bodies of his sons
[1:05:18] from the wall of bethshan and came to
[1:05:21] jebus and burnt them there
[1:05:23] and then they took their bones and
[1:05:24] buried them under a tree at jabbash and
[1:05:26] fasted seven days now
[1:05:28] so this is what so so they recovered the
[1:05:31] the bodies or they recovered the
[1:05:32] evidence of their failure
[1:05:34] and they buried it in a certain place
[1:05:36] now this word uh this place where they
[1:05:38] buried it
[1:05:39] it's uh it has a meaning which means dry
[1:05:42] so they buried it in a dry place they
[1:05:44] didn't bury it in a sepulchre they
[1:05:46] didn't handle the past the right way
[1:05:48] you know sometimes we can be faced with
[1:05:50] something and we just buried into our
[1:05:51] spirit
[1:05:52] and we don't deal with it you know
[1:05:54] that's that's like burying it in a dry
[1:05:55] place
[1:05:56] you know we need to bury the past in a
[1:05:58] place with his life where there's
[1:05:59] moisture where healing can come
[1:06:01] i mean redeeming you know redemption can
[1:06:03] come you know deliverance can come
[1:06:05] but if we buried in a dry place then
[1:06:07] that's when trouble can happen and
[1:06:09] we know after this so so many years
[1:06:11] later after david becomes king
[1:06:13] there was a drought in the land for
[1:06:14] three years and a part of that drought
[1:06:17] was because of this
[1:06:19] we don't want to walk in dry places
[1:06:21] sometimes we do but we're going to
[1:06:22] recognize that god is with us in the dry
[1:06:25] place
[1:06:25] israel was in the wilderness and it was
[1:06:27] a dry place but they had the very god
[1:06:30] that gave them life was walking with
[1:06:31] them they had the smitten rock
[1:06:33] right they had they had a source of
[1:06:35] water with them the whole time
[1:06:37] it means it's the same thing with us you
[1:06:39] know we're going to recognize hey
[1:06:41] we may be in a dry place but the water
[1:06:42] givers present
[1:06:44] i mean so so they had to come and they
[1:06:46] had to take the bones
[1:06:48] of saul so they had to take the failures
[1:06:50] of the past and
[1:06:52] and deal with it the right way so they
[1:06:54] took them
[1:06:55] they didn't just leave them under the
[1:06:56] tree in this dry place but they buried
[1:06:59] them where they should have been buried
[1:07:00] and that's why it says if we if we um
[1:07:04] jump back here
[1:07:08] and after that this is verse 14 into
[1:07:10] verse 14 and after that
[1:07:11] god was entreated for the land because
[1:07:14] they were praying lord how can this
[1:07:16] drought stop after this is all sorted
[1:07:19] this is why the past is so important
[1:07:21] failures of the past just deal with it
[1:07:23] right don't harbor any unforgiveness
[1:07:25] don't harbor any resentment any
[1:07:27] any guilt the lord took care of that you
[1:07:30] know brother brother john preached
[1:07:32] yesterday
[1:07:33] uh night about leaving the wound healing
[1:07:37] center
[1:07:38] you should go you should go watch it
[1:07:39] because you know he you know he
[1:07:41] basically said
[1:07:42] you can't live at a medical center that
[1:07:45] is not your final destination
[1:07:47] the purpose of the wound healing center
[1:07:49] is to leave the wound healing center
[1:07:51] that's why you go because you want to
[1:07:52] leave right i never want to say oh i'm
[1:07:54] going to go live at the doctor's place
[1:07:56] no the reason of going is to leave that
[1:07:58] place so once the lord's brought healing
[1:08:00] and restoration don't dwell there
[1:08:02] with your wounds walk on with god amen
[1:08:06] so so this is what they had to do they
[1:08:07] had to take the failures of the past
[1:08:09] they had to bury them in the right place
[1:08:10] then they could walk on but the thing is
[1:08:12] though once the past was dealt with then
[1:08:15] who
[1:08:15] who came on the scene the enemy came on
[1:08:17] the scene
[1:08:18] oh my so here we are in a in a time
[1:08:21] where where they've had a famine they've
[1:08:23] dealt with the failures of the past and
[1:08:25] we know that we've all had failures
[1:08:28] we've all had disappointments we've all
[1:08:30] had bits in our life
[1:08:32] maybe they're very long very big but to
[1:08:34] us they're all big right that we wish oh
[1:08:36] boy why do i have to go through that but
[1:08:37] you know
[1:08:38] there's a purpose for all these things
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:43] so you know they had to leave the
[1:08:46] you know they had to deal with those
[1:08:47] things and then the philistines came on
[1:08:49] ward against them
[1:08:50] and now this is where a new generation
[1:08:53] arose
[1:08:54] david david nearly got killed by this
[1:08:57] one son of the giant
[1:08:59] and so a younger generation came and
[1:09:01] helped him
[1:09:02] and so there comes now now but we have
[1:09:05] to realize
[1:09:06] that the sons if they're sons of goliath
[1:09:09] they would have looked a bit like
[1:09:11] goliath they would have had
[1:09:12] glass kind of temperament right you can
[1:09:15] see yourself and your children
[1:09:18] amen you want to give them official
[1:09:19] letter of apology many times because of
[1:09:21] that but
[1:09:22] you know you see yourself and your
[1:09:23] children right so the characteristics
[1:09:25] that goliath had were in the children
[1:09:28] the sons so so it's it's amazing how the
[1:09:32] younger generation thinks that
[1:09:33] us oldies don't know what it's like to
[1:09:35] face the devils of today
[1:09:37] we'll face them we've faced those giants
[1:09:41] right and and we're going to come into
[1:09:43] the prophet's ministry in ours as well
[1:09:44] but you know we face those giants they
[1:09:46] may look a bit different but it's the
[1:09:48] same characteristics
[1:09:50] it's the same nature i mean trying to
[1:09:52] stop us you know live according to our
[1:09:54] god-given privilege
[1:09:55] hallelujah i mean so but it was the
[1:09:59] younger generation that
[1:10:00] wiped out the sons of the giant and so
[1:10:03] that's why it's so important
[1:10:05] we're all young but we've all got a
[1:10:08] place we've all got a position we've all
[1:10:10] got a sword to draw we've got an enemy
[1:10:12] to defeat
[1:10:13] because it's amazing at a giant in the
[1:10:16] land can can
[1:10:17] can stop the whole march of the people
[1:10:20] goliath
[1:10:20] goliath stopped israel for 40 days
[1:10:22] making his boasts
[1:10:24] they were stuck for 40 days he made his
[1:10:27] boast until one stood up and said i'll
[1:10:29] i'll take him i'll take this guy i've
[1:10:32] got a testimony hello you begin to
[1:10:34] testify and i'm gonna
[1:10:35] you know there's a giant in the land
[1:10:37] maybe it's just in my land don't testify
[1:10:39] about anything
[1:10:41] don't share testimony you know there was
[1:10:44] pressure on brother branham's day
[1:10:46] don't publish the testimonies of what
[1:10:48] god does
[1:10:49] there's pressure because the devil wants
[1:10:52] us to stay
[1:10:53] cold formal and powerless he doesn't
[1:10:56] want us to broadcast or
[1:10:58] publish the realities of what we believe
[1:11:00] and because the realities of what we
[1:11:02] believe go beyond doctrine
[1:11:04] but it's when that doctrine is
[1:11:05] manifested right because a testimony is
[1:11:07] the word manifested is it not
[1:11:09] hallelujah so those things the devil
[1:11:11] said no don't talk about those things
[1:11:13] so i'm here to talk about those things i
[1:11:16] mean because we're going to realize we
[1:11:17] have a living god
[1:11:18] we don't have a dead god we don't have a
[1:11:20] god that died in 1965.
[1:11:22] i mean those are brother brahms stories
[1:11:23] but what about your story
[1:11:25] hallelujah what about his testimony in
[1:11:27] your life those are the things that
[1:11:28] matter
[1:11:30] amen because we can we can gather around
[1:11:32] those things and say lord you live
[1:11:34] and if you live there you'll live there
[1:11:36] you know what david went against this
[1:11:37] goliath i mean son of the you know giant
[1:11:40] he said well i've killed one i'll kill
[1:11:41] this one
[1:11:42] but it was a season of a different
[1:11:44] generation to come to the forefront
[1:11:46] but the anointing that was upon david
[1:11:48] came upon them
[1:11:50] hallelujah and they killed every enemy
[1:11:52] that came against them
[1:11:54] amen and that must be the same thing
[1:11:56] with us we're going to take courage
[1:11:58] hallelujah we take courage the same holy
[1:12:00] ghost brother brahm says
[1:12:02] the same you know god the devil and both
[1:12:05] god they take their men they take their
[1:12:07] people but the spirit remains
[1:12:09] so the antichrist spirit in jesus day is
[1:12:11] the same antichrist spirit today
[1:12:13] but the same holy ghost back then is the
[1:12:15] same holy ghost today
[1:12:16] so the holy ghost that fell upon the
[1:12:18] believers then will do the same things
[1:12:19] today because it's the same holy ghost
[1:12:21] so we can look back in the scripture and
[1:12:23] say well god you did it back there
[1:12:25] i have the same holy ghost that they
[1:12:26] have because i believe the same word
[1:12:28] right so therefore you'll do the same
[1:12:30] things in my life as you did in their
[1:12:31] life hallelujah
[1:12:32] i mean so if it conquered there he'll
[1:12:34] conquer today i mean if he cast the
[1:12:36] devil out then he'll cast him out today
[1:12:38] if he brought deliverance then he'll
[1:12:39] bring it today
[1:12:40] healing today resurrection today
[1:12:42] hallelujah
[1:12:43] the same things amen so we can we can
[1:12:47] stand in confidence
[1:12:48] that we don't have to leave our we can
[1:12:51] bury our past
[1:12:52] and we can move on and you're glad
[1:12:57] scars mean victory we'll have scars
[1:13:02] hallelujah anyway go listen go listen to
[1:13:05] the whole convention whatever you do
[1:13:07] that's good hallelujah we were we were
[1:13:11] standing around was it that uh yesterday
[1:13:13] evening service standing around praying
[1:13:14] and the lord was there and
[1:13:16] i mean you hear the girls really pray
[1:13:19] harlow not just say a prayer prayer
[1:13:21] prayer hey darling it was awesome
[1:13:22] hallelujah just that there's such an
[1:13:23] atmosphere
[1:13:24] amen i love it how the lord you know i
[1:13:25] used to be this is me i used to be kind
[1:13:28] of skeptical about streaming services
[1:13:30] it's not the same as church and sure
[1:13:32] it's not but you can still have that
[1:13:33] same god visit you in your house
[1:13:35] it's not just you know now here is the
[1:13:38] sadducees
[1:13:39] which don't believe a real picture of
[1:13:41] churches today they don't believe in the
[1:13:43] supernatural
[1:13:44] they just couldn't believe it now
[1:13:46] remember remember there's a people today
[1:13:48] that don't believe in the holy
[1:13:50] spirit ruling and governing the church
[1:13:52] they don't believe in miracles they
[1:13:54] don't believe in science they don't
[1:13:55] believe in the supernatural
[1:13:56] they just don't believe it now that
[1:13:58] spirit is nothing new
[1:14:00] here it is right here on the sadducees
[1:14:03] you know why they're called sadducees
[1:14:05] they didn't believe in a
[1:14:06] that's what brother kevin grant you know
[1:14:09] you just said you know why they're
[1:14:10] called sadducees they didn't believe in
[1:14:11] a resurrection so they said you see
[1:14:14] but people can be so down even in the
[1:14:16] message
[1:14:18] you know and but the resurrection is not
[1:14:21] real to them
[1:14:22] amen but once it's real to you oh
[1:14:24] brother you just rejoice
[1:14:26] i mean they believe the same thing see
[1:14:28] spirits don't die people die
[1:14:29] spirits i mean spirits go on god took
[1:14:32] his spirit took his man elijah and a
[1:14:34] double portion of his spirit came upon
[1:14:36] elisha is that right then about 800
[1:14:38] years later came on john the baptist is
[1:14:40] that right
[1:14:40] and comes right on down to the last day
[1:14:43] again
[1:14:44] hallelujah see spirits don't die
[1:14:47] people do but not spirit see the holy
[1:14:50] spirit it can't die
[1:14:51] it was on jesus now it's in his church
[1:14:54] always will be
[1:14:55] until he comes for his church because
[1:14:57] it's part of him
[1:14:58] amen i'm part of him see through
[1:15:01] persecutions they made fun of them back
[1:15:03] there in that day they still live here
[1:15:06] today god takes his man but not a spirit
[1:15:08] off the earth
[1:15:09] the devil takes his man but never the
[1:15:10] spirit out of the earth
[1:15:13] amen so we see that these things just
[1:15:15] continue on
[1:15:17] down through now brother branham wood
[1:15:21] would constantly fight against this
[1:15:24] all the way through his message from
[1:15:26] 1947
[1:15:28] to 1965 he would use this phrase that
[1:15:31] people said
[1:15:32] the days of miracles has passed he was
[1:15:34] constantly
[1:15:35] combating a spirit that would come in
[1:15:37] amongst believers saying god don't do
[1:15:39] those things no more
[1:15:41] constantly fighting it amen who's who's
[1:15:43] ever heard him say that yes
[1:15:45] i mean so so this is just from 1965 but
[1:15:48] you can take it all the way through the
[1:15:49] message i just searched that
[1:15:50] that phrase the days of miracles was
[1:15:52] passed over 100 i think 101 times he
[1:15:54] said it
[1:15:55] and of course he said it in different
[1:15:56] ways but and if i'm talking to some men
[1:15:58] of god here when they try to tell you at
[1:16:00] the headquarters that the days of
[1:16:01] miracles has passed
[1:16:03] and this is what we're doing here and
[1:16:04] the lord jesus is blessing us
[1:16:06] and that's a bunch of fanatic fanaticism
[1:16:08] worked up
[1:16:09] worked up and emotion there is no such a
[1:16:11] thing as divine healing get out of that
[1:16:13] group right there
[1:16:14] brother and snax's finger snaps his
[1:16:16] finger get out of it because it's the
[1:16:18] word of god being made manifest
[1:16:20] they say there's no such a thing as a
[1:16:22] apostolic days
[1:16:23] there is no baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:25] that's speaking in tongues there is
[1:16:27] nothing
[1:16:28] to it there so he's saying that he was
[1:16:31] constantly fighting the spirit
[1:16:34] that god isn't real anymore yes they had
[1:16:36] it back then but not today yes sure he
[1:16:38] did in the book of acts we'll
[1:16:39] acknowledge it back there but not now
[1:16:41] time has moved on people have changed no
[1:16:44] no people are still the same
[1:16:46] right we're still built the same way
[1:16:48] amen we have the same body spirit and
[1:16:50] soul
[1:16:50] god is absolutely still the same amen
[1:16:53] and if the same faith and the same word
[1:16:55] and the same god will produce the same
[1:16:57] results
[1:16:57] as it did in the past i mean she was
[1:16:59] constantly fighting
[1:17:01] i mean that there's days of people
[1:17:03] saying the days of miracles has passed
[1:17:05] but we know the days of miracles have
[1:17:07] not passed i mean our god is
[1:17:09] supernatural it's like
[1:17:10] if you if you jump into a body of water
[1:17:13] you will always get wet
[1:17:17] always right and it's the same thing if
[1:17:20] you go into the presence of god the
[1:17:22] supernatural is happening
[1:17:23] every time because he's a supernatural
[1:17:26] being i mean how could you make contact
[1:17:28] with a supernatural god and something
[1:17:30] supernatural not happen hallelujah so
[1:17:33] you know he was constantly fighting the
[1:17:34] days of miracles was passed
[1:17:36] and then after the prophet went off the
[1:17:38] scene many people would say do not
[1:17:39] testify of the supernatural of god
[1:17:41] because you take away from the prophets
[1:17:42] ministry
[1:17:43] actually no no to me that adds to the
[1:17:45] prophet's ministry because that's the
[1:17:47] proof what he said was true
[1:17:48] i mean because the proof of the pudding
[1:17:50] is actually you know what he said and
[1:17:52] what was demonstrated in his life is now
[1:17:54] demonstrated in the life of believers
[1:17:57] i mean we can't just you know other
[1:17:58] great moves of god like the lutherans
[1:18:00] they could look back at martin luther
[1:18:01] and say well god did things in his day
[1:18:03] but we don't but we don't see them today
[1:18:05] all wesley can say well
[1:18:06] we saw things in you know john wesley's
[1:18:09] ministry but today we don't have those
[1:18:11] things
[1:18:12] you know john wesley you know he he he
[1:18:14] preached an incredible amount of sermons
[1:18:16] traveled an incredible amount of miles
[1:18:18] on a horse preaching around and you know
[1:18:20] one day he was
[1:18:21] he was riding in his and his horse broke
[1:18:23] its leg he anointed it with oil prayed
[1:18:25] for it got it
[1:18:26] got back on it kept writing on amen
[1:18:29] things like that happened in his
[1:18:30] ministry
[1:18:31] amen but they'd say well those things
[1:18:33] don't happen no more they should happen
[1:18:35] i mean pentecost can point back you know
[1:18:37] there's a book written about the thee
[1:18:40] i don't have it but you know take the
[1:18:42] history of pentecost and bring it from
[1:18:44] the azusa street revival all the way
[1:18:46] into today
[1:18:47] brother brown maybe has like half a page
[1:18:49] in the whole book but historians said
[1:18:51] that his ministry
[1:18:52] spearheaded the post-world war ii
[1:18:54] healing revival
[1:18:56] history declared it not not believers
[1:18:58] history declared it
[1:18:59] amen but you can see where where it
[1:19:01] drifted from the azusa street
[1:19:03] mission and you know if you re you know
[1:19:05] who's ever looked into that revival it
[1:19:08] wasn't just a spontaneous thing for
[1:19:09] years
[1:19:10] los angeles was under expectation people
[1:19:13] were praying they were looking because
[1:19:15] god was preparing a people
[1:19:16] from mighty visitation amen and i'll say
[1:19:20] this
[1:19:20] if that was just for the gifts to be
[1:19:22] restored how much the coming of the lord
[1:19:24] how much more a bride now that well you
[1:19:26] know you know a bride that's going to
[1:19:28] walk from this world to the next
[1:19:29] you know we should be under a great
[1:19:30] expectation lord you can take us off the
[1:19:32] earth
[1:19:33] amen at any moment hallelujah but they
[1:19:37] had to you know they could say well that
[1:19:38] happened back there what about today
[1:19:40] amen and that's the same thing even in
[1:19:42] the message you know we know this
[1:19:43] message is not an intellectual revival
[1:19:46] the bride's revival is a revival of
[1:19:48] reality
[1:19:49] amen where everything they had in the
[1:19:51] past we have it now
[1:19:52] and we have a book open to break the
[1:19:54] cycle of revival and death
[1:19:56] that's why the mighty angel has
[1:19:57] descended because he says you're not
[1:19:58] going to go back into formalism anymore
[1:20:00] but you're going to stay in revival
[1:20:02] and the god of the book of acts is going
[1:20:04] to manifest himself in your life
[1:20:07] amen now brother brown when he when he
[1:20:10] you know he paralleled his ministry with
[1:20:13] the ministry of david it's important to
[1:20:14] see yourself in the scripture
[1:20:16] now i'm sorry if this is a bit small um
[1:20:19] he says and i and i want to get alone
[1:20:22] what i want to do uh what i want to do
[1:20:26] is to myself
[1:20:27] and pray because i believe uh that now
[1:20:30] is god by his grace has let me spearhead
[1:20:32] a revival that swept the world in the
[1:20:34] beginning
[1:20:35] see now i believe there's something
[1:20:37] coming that's going to be a double
[1:20:38] portion to the church
[1:20:40] and i feel that down in my heart now
[1:20:43] back yonder the last sermon i preached
[1:20:45] in my tabernacle was on david and
[1:20:47] goliath
[1:20:48] and i said here even my own baptist
[1:20:51] bishop stood there and said
[1:20:53] uh what did what did you eat that night
[1:20:55] he said you had a nightmare
[1:20:56] i said no sir i don't i don't appreciate
[1:20:59] that
[1:21:00] i said no it was the truth to me it was
[1:21:02] real
[1:21:03] he said you with your grammar school
[1:21:05] education is going to pray for kings and
[1:21:07] great men and statesmen and so forth
[1:21:08] and are going to be healed i said yes
[1:21:10] sir he said well how
[1:21:13] do you get that i said you better go
[1:21:15] back
[1:21:16] over at your tabernacle and forget about
[1:21:18] it i said how can i forget about it when
[1:21:20] it's wrote indelible by the blood of
[1:21:22] christ
[1:21:23] across my heart i said you'll see he
[1:21:26] said i'll be listening
[1:21:30] and you've seen the voice of healing
[1:21:31] here recently what uh what he apologized
[1:21:34] and he prayed for the sick himself now
[1:21:36] he said if i hadn't been so backslidden
[1:21:38] i would have listened to the boy and
[1:21:39] paid attention to what he said about
[1:21:41] visions
[1:21:42] you read what dr davis said all right
[1:21:46] now when god speaks anything though it
[1:21:47] linger it's got to come to pass
[1:21:50] now i believe that god is going to do it
[1:21:52] and there was that great modernistic
[1:21:54] day of science scientists and everything
[1:21:57] standing out there saying days of
[1:21:58] miracles has passed and so forth
[1:22:01] but god said go so he's so he's
[1:22:03] addressing there's a giant in the land
[1:22:05] i've got a sling of faith a slingshot of
[1:22:09] faith i'm gonna down this thing
[1:22:10] i mean that the church the living god
[1:22:12] can rally amen
[1:22:14] and the work can go forward i mean like
[1:22:16] david of old he couldn't slay all the
[1:22:18] philistines but he could
[1:22:20] but if uh but if he could only kill that
[1:22:23] boaster out there goliath and so when
[1:22:25] goliath was slain all israel took
[1:22:27] courage in a way they went
[1:22:29] and they beat the philistines plum back
[1:22:31] into their gates well now that's the way
[1:22:33] it's been now ministers has seen the
[1:22:35] vision
[1:22:35] and divine healing now even the
[1:22:37] presbyterian church in new york and all
[1:22:38] this practicing divine healing
[1:22:41] having healing services on wednesday
[1:22:42] night colleges are adopting it
[1:22:44] throughout the world in korea they had a
[1:22:46] divine healing service here not long ago
[1:22:48] and korea and thousands got healed down
[1:22:50] in japan everywhere from australia
[1:22:52] and around the world comes the news
[1:22:53] great news going through
[1:22:55] the books went forth ministers read
[1:22:57] taking courage and went out and divine
[1:22:59] healing has swept the world
[1:23:01] thank god so here he was he says
[1:23:04] yeah he preached on david and glass
[1:23:05] saying i'm going to go and take this
[1:23:07] giant's head off
[1:23:08] and he did hallelujah and that giant
[1:23:11] fell but now
[1:23:12] we're in another generation we're
[1:23:14] another generation where the sons of the
[1:23:16] vagina and the land
[1:23:18] i mean so now there must be a people on
[1:23:20] the earth that take courage
[1:23:22] and say well if he can do it the same
[1:23:25] anointing's upon me
[1:23:26] i can down that giant too hallelujah he
[1:23:29] may be a son of the giant but hey
[1:23:31] we're a son of god son and daughter of
[1:23:33] god hallelujah we're not a son of
[1:23:35] william branham
[1:23:37] amen we're a son of jesus christ amen
[1:23:40] we're
[1:23:40] born hallelujah so
[1:23:44] so here here's a time now i'm just
[1:23:48] laying a bit of a background for things
[1:23:49] but
[1:23:50] now when i preached my sermon before
[1:23:52] leaving this is him speaking about it
[1:23:53] again lifting him up out of history
[1:23:55] when i preached my sermon before leaving
[1:23:57] 11 years ago across this pulpit
[1:23:59] and mrs gertie sitting there saying that
[1:24:01] only believe in the great giant stood
[1:24:03] yonder
[1:24:03] like i preached on david and goliath
[1:24:05] there was science and great
[1:24:07] and the great known world to condemn
[1:24:09] divine healing and put it to shame
[1:24:11] and everyone telling me boy you you'll
[1:24:13] crack up out there
[1:24:14] they'll throw you in jail they'll do
[1:24:16] this that or the other
[1:24:18] but the god of history had come to the
[1:24:20] on the scene yonder
[1:24:22] and told me to do it and i did it by his
[1:24:24] grace and his mercy that same god
[1:24:27] that was history of ten years ago has
[1:24:29] raised on the scene again
[1:24:31] just as sure as he brought that to pass
[1:24:33] he shall bring this to pass
[1:24:35] he's the god of history and he's god of
[1:24:37] present day
[1:24:38] he never slumbers or sleeps he cannot
[1:24:40] die for he has no beginning or no end
[1:24:43] remember if god gives a promise god's
[1:24:45] obligated to fulfill the promise
[1:24:47] remember it wasn't brother brown that
[1:24:48] said i'm going to do it god said you're
[1:24:49] going to do it
[1:24:51] holy god was the one who did it right
[1:24:54] amen it's the same thing with us
[1:24:55] when god comes on the scene if god gives
[1:24:58] you a promise
[1:24:59] it's not your it's not you that has to
[1:25:01] make it happen
[1:25:02] if god gave the promise god gave the
[1:25:04] promise hallelujah
[1:25:06] so he can just rejoice don't get
[1:25:08] stressed about it if he said it's going
[1:25:10] to be it's going to be
[1:25:12] amen hallelujah
[1:25:15] now joshua would joshua would come to
[1:25:19] you know come come before jericho here
[1:25:23] and he would you know he had already
[1:25:25] been told by god as i was with moses
[1:25:28] so shall i be with thee but he was
[1:25:30] wondering how
[1:25:32] on earth was he going to take jericho it
[1:25:34] was impossible
[1:25:35] humanly they had no siege equipment they
[1:25:38] had no battering rams they had no
[1:25:39] ladders they had no siege towers they
[1:25:40] had no catapults
[1:25:42] they had nothing that could actually
[1:25:43] physically take that city so it's
[1:25:45] wondering how on earth was it going to
[1:25:46] be done but remember
[1:25:47] if god said as i was with moses so i'll
[1:25:49] be with you
[1:25:50] god's going to be the one who will take
[1:25:52] the city amen and god
[1:25:54] wanted to display his power to to joshua
[1:25:57] but also that younger generation that
[1:25:59] believed the message
[1:26:00] they didn't turn down what moses sent
[1:26:02] right they believed it they took god at
[1:26:04] his word and they came into the land
[1:26:06] now god wanted to prove himself to them
[1:26:10] it's the same thing with us we haven't
[1:26:11] turned this word down we haven't turned
[1:26:13] the lord jesus down we've entered into
[1:26:15] the land the son of man
[1:26:16] right we've entered in and now he wants
[1:26:18] to display his power
[1:26:20] to prove to us this word works and it's
[1:26:23] real and it's true and it's exactly
[1:26:25] what it means it does amen hallelujah
[1:26:28] hey if it said it will give you the holy
[1:26:30] ghost you get the holy ghost
[1:26:31] it says by your stripes you're healed
[1:26:33] you get healed you get delivered you get
[1:26:35] led hallelujah
[1:26:36] amen amen so now so then he comes out
[1:26:40] now i know you know all these things
[1:26:41] very well but you know
[1:26:42] he comes out and he sees a man he says
[1:26:44] and it came to pass when
[1:26:46] joshua was by jericho they lifted up his
[1:26:49] eyes and looked and behold there stood a
[1:26:50] man over against him with a sword jordan
[1:26:52] in his hand
[1:26:53] and joshua went unto him and said are
[1:26:54] thou for us or for our adversaries
[1:26:57] and he said nay but as the captain of
[1:27:00] the host of lord am i now come so he's
[1:27:02] saying
[1:27:02] he's not saying i'm for you or even
[1:27:04] against you i've come to take over your
[1:27:06] battle
[1:27:07] right i know you know i'm maybe i'm just
[1:27:09] getting old i'm just repeating myself
[1:27:10] but i want this
[1:27:11] i really want this dan corrin if he
[1:27:13] comes and takes over the battle
[1:27:15] remember it's not just it wasn't just
[1:27:16] for jericho like i said on wednesday but
[1:27:18] it's for the whole campaign
[1:27:20] so when god comes and comes down and you
[1:27:22] give your life to him and he meets you
[1:27:24] more than just a baptist way of giving
[1:27:26] your heart to the lord but he really
[1:27:27] changes your life
[1:27:28] what is he saying i've come to take over
[1:27:30] your walk i've come to take over your
[1:27:32] battles
[1:27:33] amen it's not that oh he's on my side am
[1:27:35] i on his side
[1:27:36] amen and he'll lead you in your campaign
[1:27:38] and it's not just for one battle well
[1:27:40] i'm sick it's not just a sickness
[1:27:42] it's not just trouble in the home or
[1:27:43] whatever it may be it's for your whole
[1:27:45] walk all the way into glory
[1:27:47] that's when that's what he says i've
[1:27:49] come to take over
[1:27:51] amen so for joshua's entire life the
[1:27:53] angel of the lord was present
[1:27:55] to lead him and lead the campaign
[1:27:58] hallelujah that's how important
[1:28:00] it is to have a personal visitation with
[1:28:02] god amen
[1:28:03] hallelujah so he says no i've come to
[1:28:07] take over the battle and joshua fell on
[1:28:09] his face
[1:28:10] amen and worshiped him he said what
[1:28:13] saith my lord unto his servant
[1:28:15] and the captor of the lord so said unto
[1:28:17] joshua loose thy
[1:28:18] shoe from off thy foot for the place
[1:28:20] where on thou standest is holy
[1:28:22] and joshua did so so he took over the
[1:28:25] whole campaign
[1:28:27] battle see it was different see
[1:28:29] beforehand it would have just been
[1:28:31] humanly
[1:28:32] joshua thought i have this many men they
[1:28:34] have this kind of weapons how we're
[1:28:36] going to fight this kind of battle
[1:28:38] but now it was totally different now
[1:28:39] they had swords but they are anointed
[1:28:42] now their shields add shields but they
[1:28:43] are anointed shields i mean
[1:28:45] and it's like when god takes over our
[1:28:47] life sure we have a sword
[1:28:49] but when the sword becomes anointed and
[1:28:51] the mouth of the bride that's a very
[1:28:53] different kind of weapon
[1:28:54] amen it's a weapon that will cut off
[1:28:56] every devil's head it will cast them out
[1:28:58] it will bring healing he'll bring
[1:28:59] deliverance it'll bring the baptism of
[1:29:01] the holy ghost it'll bring creative
[1:29:02] power into the church
[1:29:03] amen because the sword is anointed
[1:29:06] remember they had to still be armed they
[1:29:08] still had
[1:29:08] you know they didn't just walk like a
[1:29:10] sunday school picnic you know girl was
[1:29:11] jericho be taken
[1:29:13] they had their swords they were
[1:29:14] sharpened they had their shields they
[1:29:15] had their helmets
[1:29:16] they were ready to fight right but when
[1:29:19] when the captain come to take over
[1:29:21] now their weapons were anointed now
[1:29:22] their shields were anointed
[1:29:24] hallelujah because they were actually
[1:29:26] promised you won't lose a man in this
[1:29:28] campaign
[1:29:29] that's why when when when they tried to
[1:29:31] take ai and yo yo there was a failure ai
[1:29:33] that's when joshua he didn't say well
[1:29:35] let's just get more men and try it again
[1:29:37] he said no something's wrong something's
[1:29:39] wrong you know there's sin in the camp
[1:29:41] this is why these people died not
[1:29:42] because we were fighting but because
[1:29:44] there's sin in the camp
[1:29:45] right and so he he called a halt he
[1:29:47] found out where it was
[1:29:48] they dealt with it then they just moved
[1:29:50] on and this is how we're going to be
[1:29:54] because they will promise you won't lose
[1:29:55] a man in this battle
[1:29:57] well there's the same thing why because
[1:29:58] their weapons were anointed
[1:30:01] hallelujah their armor was anointed
[1:30:04] you're the armor of god is the baptism
[1:30:05] of the holy ghost it's a supernatural
[1:30:07] armor
[1:30:08] it's not a natural arm it's a
[1:30:09] supernatural armor hallelujah
[1:30:12] amen we got the best we got the best
[1:30:15] gear in the world
[1:30:17] hallelujah man hypersonic missiles we
[1:30:20] got better
[1:30:22] nuclear bombs better hydrogen bombs
[1:30:24] better inter
[1:30:25] continental intercontinental ballistic
[1:30:28] missiles we've got better than that
[1:30:30] we've got the better better than
[1:30:31] anything they have all of the armies
[1:30:34] of the world better hallelujah
[1:30:36] hallelujah
[1:30:38] amen no weapon formed against us shall
[1:30:40] prosper
[1:30:42] hallelujah so now see the thing is
[1:30:45] well to me i believe joshua won the
[1:30:47] victory of the whole campaign when he
[1:30:48] met the captain
[1:30:50] that was when victory came the victory
[1:30:52] just had to be lived out
[1:30:53] after that moment because he met the
[1:30:55] lord the lord says this is how it's
[1:30:56] going to be i'll lead you in this
[1:30:57] campaign i've come to take over
[1:30:58] okay so if jesus is the general we're
[1:31:00] going to win
[1:31:02] hallelujah so to me the whole victory of
[1:31:05] the whole campaign was one right there
[1:31:07] sure they had to go fight they had to go
[1:31:09] fight battles and different things but
[1:31:10] they won the battle
[1:31:11] they won the victory who's following me
[1:31:13] remember when you when you meet the lord
[1:31:15] you won everything
[1:31:17] you've won hallelujah sure there's a lot
[1:31:20] of battles
[1:31:20] trials hardship pain discouragement
[1:31:23] whatever comes your way but you've still
[1:31:24] won
[1:31:26] remember it's not him that wins the war
[1:31:28] at himself i mean it's not him that wins
[1:31:30] the battle
[1:31:30] him that wins the war napoleon won a lot
[1:31:33] of battles but he lost the war
[1:31:35] and he died as an exile hitler won a lot
[1:31:38] of battles but he lost the war
[1:31:41] amen as they that was looking pretty bad
[1:31:43] for the allies but hey they won the war
[1:31:45] eventually
[1:31:47] it's the same thing you say well it's
[1:31:48] looking pretty bad so far uh it's not
[1:31:50] the end
[1:31:52] amen amen
[1:31:56] the word of god we know is a sword
[1:32:00] right amen amen people have used it as a
[1:32:03] weapon
[1:32:04] spirit-filled or not spirit-filled
[1:32:05] they've used it as a weapon
[1:32:07] right there's whole whole bible schools
[1:32:09] that use it as a weapon
[1:32:12] but it's just in the intellectual mind
[1:32:14] they've tried to yield it for two
[1:32:15] thousand years
[1:32:17] but it has nothing compared to when the
[1:32:18] word is anointed in the heart of the
[1:32:20] believer
[1:32:22] amen hallelujah now
[1:32:26] when he won the victory there the
[1:32:28] victory is just spread to others
[1:32:30] right what happened on the day of
[1:32:33] pentecost they won the victory
[1:32:35] god was dwelling in them they didn't
[1:32:37] just stay in the upper room and just
[1:32:38] have a
[1:32:39] have a whatever time no doors were open
[1:32:42] windows open they climbed out of there
[1:32:44] shouting and praising god acting like
[1:32:46] drunk people
[1:32:46] why because god's life is is to spread
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:50] hallelujah so the victory that was won
[1:32:52] amen there
[1:32:54] spread to others now hallelujah now
[1:32:57] um this is how it should be you meet the
[1:33:00] lord you want everyone to meet the lord
[1:33:01] i remember when i met him at university
[1:33:03] i thought man everyone's going to
[1:33:04] believe this
[1:33:05] why because he became real to me it's
[1:33:07] more than ink on paper he's alive
[1:33:09] it's more than a voice on tape he's
[1:33:10] alive the words alive
[1:33:12] hallelujah amen it's like you know
[1:33:15] sorry sorry honeybee i'm going to share
[1:33:17] some testimonials from you as well but
[1:33:18] you know
[1:33:19] you know after after her sister melanie
[1:33:21] met the lord they began to pray for the
[1:33:22] church and you know in tauranga
[1:33:24] and they were praying that god would
[1:33:25] move because they knew that many people
[1:33:27] were going to church just because they
[1:33:29] had to
[1:33:29] and they knew that many people didn't
[1:33:31] know him in that church they were
[1:33:32] praying and they were praying
[1:33:33] and then they had a tongue and
[1:33:34] interpretation that god would come down
[1:33:36] and move in a powerful way
[1:33:37] and two weeks later it happened just
[1:33:39] that way there were young people in that
[1:33:40] service that said i don't even believe
[1:33:42] there's a god they said they're atheists
[1:33:44] but in that presence of god they were on
[1:33:46] their knees giving their lives to the
[1:33:47] lord
[1:33:48] i mean they knew that god was real so
[1:33:49] what happened they won the victory in
[1:33:51] prayer
[1:33:52] maybe took a while to pray through but
[1:33:53] when they pray through god said i'm
[1:33:54] going to move in a powerful way
[1:33:56] and he did and it should be the same
[1:33:58] thing even here amen when we have
[1:33:59] victories in prayer
[1:34:00] we should be under expectation god you
[1:34:02] move in this place
[1:34:04] amen because the same god back then is
[1:34:06] the same god here
[1:34:08] hallelujah that's how it should be amen
[1:34:11] we should have a burden
[1:34:12] for one for for each and every one of us
[1:34:17] refill them lord baptize them with your
[1:34:19] holy ghost doesn't matter how big or old
[1:34:21] young fat thin whatever
[1:34:23] you know baptize them refill them lord

[1:34:30] and the trouble and fill me up with your
[1:34:31] goodness that i can walk out of this
[1:34:33] place victorious
[1:34:34] hallelujah amen that's exactly how it
[1:34:37] should be
[1:34:39] hallelujah you know god
[1:34:42] god visits us in many different ways
[1:34:45] you know i'll say this i'll swap to me
[1:34:48] soon
[1:34:49] you know before christy and i were ever
[1:34:51] courting or anything she had a dream
[1:34:53] with angel lord lifted her up
[1:34:54] showed her a panoramic of wellington to
[1:34:56] make her real show her this is where
[1:34:58] you're going to live
[1:34:59] that she'll be married to me that she
[1:35:01] would take me to where my job was for
[1:35:03] the first year she would drive me
[1:35:05] she'd be my taxi to and from work and we
[1:35:07] had children
[1:35:08] and we're witnessing the people that was
[1:35:10] before we were even courting or anything
[1:35:12] and i asked her the other day what's it
[1:35:14] like to be living a dream
[1:35:17] and she said and she said well it's you
[1:35:20] know you go to the place you like like
[1:35:21] when we first moved here
[1:35:22] and she said well it's like i've been
[1:35:24] here before yeah and this is what the
[1:35:26] word does he waves
[1:35:29] visions of ourselves before us as that
[1:35:31] as that song says
[1:35:32] so the word tries to show us this is
[1:35:33] really who you are
[1:35:35] and there's some there's like a
[1:35:37] familiarity about it
[1:35:38] that's me i know what that is
[1:35:42] hallelujah amen
[1:35:46] this is how it should be now back in
[1:35:50] this is this is back at our christchurch
[1:35:52] days this is well back in my
[1:35:53] christchurch days
[1:35:55] so i meet the lord my parents are living
[1:35:57] in papua new guinea i'm just going to
[1:35:59] share some testimonies maybe i just want
[1:36:00] to kill a giant in my life
[1:36:02] right maybe you're just going to kill
[1:36:03] the guy and move on so you know
[1:36:06] brother ed said we want testimonies
[1:36:07] today well i already had it planned
[1:36:09] not that we talk about these things you
[1:36:11] know what i love about this place it's
[1:36:12] incredible
[1:36:13] we don't see we never have a me okay
[1:36:16] sunday school children
[1:36:17] we never have a meeting teachers and me
[1:36:19] and say
[1:36:21] this week's theme is gonna be whatever
[1:36:24] and then we plan it no no
[1:36:26] the lord has the meeting with us
[1:36:27] individually you preach on this you
[1:36:29] teach on this you teach on this you talk
[1:36:31] about this driving here and talk about
[1:36:33] this with your children
[1:36:34] and then you walk in it's like how do
[1:36:36] they know what we've been talking about
[1:36:38] it's the same mind it's the same holy
[1:36:40] ghost hallelujah i mean we have a
[1:36:42] headquarters
[1:36:44] he sends whatsapps he sends emails and
[1:36:46] that's the holy ghost by the way it's
[1:36:47] not a physical man
[1:36:49] hallelujah we're gonna realize when you
[1:36:51] hear something it's not oh well
[1:36:52] this person talked to the pastor about
[1:36:54] it so he's preaching about it or this
[1:36:55] but dude i don't know this is not how
[1:36:57] this works
[1:36:59] hallelujah god's on our case
[1:37:02] he knows where we're at he knows what we
[1:37:04] go through you can't hide nothing
[1:37:06] from him and to me that's a good thing
[1:37:08] because we're gonna be stuck in
[1:37:09] alternative reality
[1:37:11] but god says i don't want you in that
[1:37:13] reality this is not your ordained place
[1:37:15] you're ordained places by me walking and
[1:37:18] victory but it's amazing you get stuck
[1:37:19] in things like
[1:37:20] we'll get to this but you know i used to
[1:37:22] be a real avid gamer
[1:37:25] i was into a lot of things but i was
[1:37:26] into gaming too you know
[1:37:28] but the thing is when the lord so after
[1:37:30] i met the lord
[1:37:31] and i was you know but i was still in
[1:37:32] games but i realized one day what am i
[1:37:34] doing
[1:37:35] now if someone told me god will live so
[1:37:38] much more in your life if you just throw
[1:37:39] them out
[1:37:40] i wouldn't really i wouldn't really have
[1:37:42] it in mind
[1:37:43] you know i wouldn't really accept it
[1:37:46] because are you just gonna get rid of
[1:37:47] things but why
[1:37:48] but once you actually get rid of the
[1:37:50] thing and god begins to live you know i
[1:37:52] would be
[1:37:53] i used to live in a house where none
[1:37:54] others were christians
[1:37:56] i was the only one i think they were
[1:37:57] just all atheists but i dedicated my
[1:38:00] room to the lord
[1:38:00] and my life first and foremost so
[1:38:02] whenever god would just come down i'd be
[1:38:04] washing dishes
[1:38:05] i'd be walking to uni i'd be and god
[1:38:07] would just come down
[1:38:09] and just speak to me and visit me and so
[1:38:11] whenever the prince of lord would come
[1:38:12] down i'd just go into my room i just
[1:38:13] worship him there
[1:38:15] so you can live in a place and the
[1:38:17] reason i'm saying this is you know
[1:38:19] it can be done but once i got rid of the
[1:38:21] games
[1:38:22] the lord was just so much more real in
[1:38:23] the in my life
[1:38:25] it was like a you know a pipe was
[1:38:29] unclogged
[1:38:30] i had met the lord before that god had
[1:38:32] changed my life filled
[1:38:34] filled my heart with his love and just
[1:38:35] you know the bible became a new book and
[1:38:37] it became personal to me but when those
[1:38:39] things just went it's like
[1:38:41] you know it's like some filters were
[1:38:42] taken off or something but the thing is
[1:38:44] i don't know how i wish i could describe
[1:38:47] going from having it to being free and
[1:38:49] then god walking
[1:38:50] see because remember god never leaves a
[1:38:52] void in our lives
[1:38:53] he doesn't say oh you've got to quit all
[1:38:55] this stuff and do this and he doesn't
[1:38:56] fill it with himself
[1:38:58] that's why god wants to fill our life
[1:39:00] with himself
[1:39:01] hallelujah then you ask the question
[1:39:03] well would you ever want to go back to
[1:39:04] that stuff
[1:39:05] no why would i trade him
[1:39:08] for a game why would i trade the reality
[1:39:12] of him
[1:39:13] hallelujah for that
[1:39:17] that's why i say you know get rid of the
[1:39:19] stuff
[1:39:20] but it's because god wants to fill our
[1:39:22] lives amen
[1:39:23] hallelujah 24 7. amen
[1:39:27] doesn't the psalm say he gives me songs
[1:39:29] in the night or i sing on my bed or you
[1:39:30] know
[1:39:31] hallelujah yeah we just rejoicing amen
[1:39:34] so
[1:39:36] amen so okay where was i okay here i am
[1:39:39] now
[1:39:40] you know so so i so i meet the lord
[1:39:43] and then so who was at the dedication
[1:39:45] meetings here with brother ron peterson
[1:39:47] that bro your gospel way we sister
[1:39:48] maggie was there we did you come down
[1:39:50] for that
[1:39:51] no this is the first church 2008
[1:39:56] no okay anyway so i had this burden
[1:39:58] about that time because you know uni was
[1:40:00] going to
[1:40:01] wind up and i was going back to papua
[1:40:02] new guinea i thought how am i
[1:40:04] ever going to share this message with
[1:40:06] the people that don't speak english very
[1:40:07] well
[1:40:08] and i don't speak their language very
[1:40:10] good you know very good how
[1:40:11] and there's nothing in their language to
[1:40:13] give them how on earth am i going to
[1:40:15] share it
[1:40:17] and i was trying to work out in my mind
[1:40:19] while i take this book and this dvd and
[1:40:20] you know i was trying to work it out but
[1:40:22] then one day
[1:40:22] the lord just came down to my house and
[1:40:24] when he did that i just went into my
[1:40:26] room
[1:40:26] and it was such a powerful presence that
[1:40:30] i couldn't even stand
[1:40:31] i couldn't even pray i just forced on
[1:40:33] mine it was like a holy atmosphere
[1:40:35] more than a blessing more than a jumpy
[1:40:37] time such a powerful presence came down
[1:40:39] and the lord said not by power or by my
[1:40:41] might but by my spirit saith the lord of
[1:40:43] hosts
[1:40:44] he said basically you just go you show
[1:40:47] up and i'll do the rest
[1:40:49] and in my mind i've always been an
[1:40:52] accidental believer just kind of fall
[1:40:54] into things
[1:40:56] i don't plan these things you know my
[1:40:59] life's goals
[1:41:00] were not to pastor a church and be do
[1:41:02] mission work and what you know
[1:41:04] i don't know what my goals were at the
[1:41:05] time but they sure weren't even near the
[1:41:07] list
[1:41:08] but the law came down such a strong way
[1:41:09] and i've only ever had it like that that
[1:41:11] time
[1:41:13] and so i went there and you know my
[1:41:17] my parents housemate she was a she's a
[1:41:20] papua new guinean she was a christian
[1:41:21] ruth
[1:41:22] but she didn't speak english but she
[1:41:24] could understand english
[1:41:25] so so i could talk to her in english and
[1:41:27] and she would speak back to me in pidgin
[1:41:29] which is a couple of talk you know
[1:41:32] kind of like broken english but you know
[1:41:34] yourself we talked about him and i'm
[1:41:35] almost now
[1:41:36] you're happy you hear what they say and
[1:41:38] you're happy and um
[1:41:39] you know so so i was praying one morning
[1:41:41] i said lord how can i share this message
[1:41:43] with ruth because
[1:41:44] she was like the only one i knew and the
[1:41:46] lord said to me real simple
[1:41:48] show the deep calls to the deep show the
[1:41:50] prophet's ministry from scripture and
[1:41:52] tell her your testimony
[1:41:54] and she came into work that morning she
[1:41:56] came into work late she lived like on
[1:41:57] the
[1:41:58] on the property in a little house she
[1:42:00] came in late
[1:42:01] and i didn't know this at the time but
[1:42:03] but she was praying that morning all
[1:42:05] trouble saying lord i need to hear from
[1:42:06] you today
[1:42:07] god works both ends right so she comes
[1:42:10] in has a big smile on her face said ruth
[1:42:11] can i
[1:42:12] can i tell you my testimony and show you
[1:42:13] this and so he did
[1:42:15] and then and then and then she said
[1:42:17] after i explained the prophet's ministry
[1:42:19] from scripture she said
[1:42:20] can you write all these scriptures down
[1:42:22] so i can go read it in my bible now
[1:42:24] her bible wasn't an english bible it's a
[1:42:26] pigeon bible
[1:42:27] and so i i went online and and got
[1:42:30] attracted by i think brother rich searle
[1:42:32] you know explaining the prophet's
[1:42:33] ministry from scripture in english
[1:42:35] i printed off gave it to her she took
[1:42:37] that home
[1:42:38] and she came into work the next morning
[1:42:40] rejoicing she said you know
[1:42:42] she said normally english she can't read
[1:42:44] much of it but she said when she opened
[1:42:46] that book and started reading it she
[1:42:47] could understand every single word
[1:42:49] and the prince of god came down so
[1:42:50] strongly to the into her house she had
[1:42:52] to put it down go
[1:42:53] go outside rejoice and pick it up and
[1:42:54] read it again
[1:42:56] god goes beyond a language barrier
[1:42:58] sometimes we think how can i be a
[1:42:59] witness god is the witness
[1:43:01] god is the one that does the witnessing
[1:43:04] hallelujah
[1:43:04] and then we started having meetings just
[1:43:06] just in the in the factory compound so
[1:43:09] my dad used to run a a coconut oil milk
[1:43:12] copper mill
[1:43:13] and we lived basically there was the
[1:43:14] factory then there was a compound where
[1:43:15] our house was
[1:43:16] and we would just start having meetings
[1:43:19] in the house or outside their house or
[1:43:21] you know where the workers were living
[1:43:22] or in a village and but people would
[1:43:24] just come
[1:43:25] i didn't have to go find people people
[1:43:27] found me
[1:43:29] hallelujah how's it you know hallelujah
[1:43:32] and then so and then so it started from
[1:43:35] there
[1:43:36] and then now i was there and i remember
[1:43:37] when i was um so they have a patch of
[1:43:40] road and
[1:43:40] and christina this patch of road where
[1:43:42] it goes past one of the volcanoes
[1:43:44] and it's just it's just a dirt road now
[1:43:46] i've been four by fouring a lot
[1:43:50] papua new guinea is four by fouring all
[1:43:51] the time potholes have potholes have
[1:43:53] potholes have ravines you know
[1:43:55] kind of thing so you know anyway um so
[1:43:58] i was in the back of my parents uh jeep
[1:44:00] or eugene i was praying lord how can i
[1:44:02] how can i start copying this and getting
[1:44:04] it out i had some cassette tapes
[1:44:06] and i saw brother dennis kennedy just
[1:44:08] just in my mind like a vision or
[1:44:09] i don't know how to describe it but he
[1:44:10] was standing outside the old church of
[1:44:12] gospel way
[1:44:12] handing out cassette tapes then so i
[1:44:15] bought myself a cassette tape
[1:44:16] player and would record them real time
[1:44:19] and start distributing the message that
[1:44:21] way
[1:44:22] and then um i've got a purpose
[1:44:26] for for for sharing these things i want
[1:44:28] to kill a giant
[1:44:29] let's kill a john and then so i came
[1:44:31] back to new zealand and i had a few
[1:44:33] contacts people would just watch the
[1:44:34] deep author deep and rejoice and
[1:44:36] you know so i said well i can't afford
[1:44:38] to buy the book so i started printing
[1:44:40] the books
[1:44:41] and i burnt out a you know printer and
[1:44:43] different yo this is just what i did and
[1:44:44] i
[1:44:45] i didn't know what my flatmates saw to
[1:44:46] me i was i was flirting with christians
[1:44:48] by that time
[1:44:48] you know i witnessed to them and you
[1:44:50] know one of my friend of theirs
[1:44:52] you know i spoke to him about baptism he
[1:44:53] was so convicted that night he
[1:44:55] called one of my flatmates and got
[1:44:57] baptized hallelujah different things
[1:44:59] like that would happen
[1:45:00] you know but the thing is it all started
[1:45:02] with a burden
[1:45:03] and then god always meets a burden now
[1:45:06] to me
[1:45:07] when that happened and and i just i'm
[1:45:10] i'm slow you know
[1:45:11] it takes a while to catch on to things
[1:45:13] like christine you know
[1:45:14] the lord told her like a good year
[1:45:16] before yeah before he started courting
[1:45:17] that we were going to get married
[1:45:19] and she would pray and the lord would
[1:45:21] show us scriptures and speak to her as
[1:45:22] you know as he does and
[1:45:24] and then and then and then one day he
[1:45:26] you know shows her proverbs 18 22 if i
[1:45:28] have it right and she says
[1:45:30] lord it's all very fine telling me but
[1:45:33] what can you tell him
[1:45:37] and i think that's a real good way of
[1:45:39] doing things
[1:45:40] you can have a revelation that your
[1:45:42] children are coming in but well lord
[1:45:43] can't you
[1:45:44] tell them can you work on their end now
[1:45:47] you've worked on my and i'm in perfect
[1:45:48] peace i'm just rejoicing
[1:45:50] waiting for them waiting for them to
[1:45:51] come home but but can't you get on their
[1:45:53] case
[1:45:54] hallelujah so i used to
[1:45:58] i used to i'm sorry i don't anymore but
[1:46:00] i used to read a proverb every day
[1:46:02] brother blue kennedy um it was shared at
[1:46:04] his memorial service that that's what he
[1:46:05] used to do
[1:46:06] and so it was the i was going to see
[1:46:08] christine on the 18th
[1:46:10] and so i was reading proverbs 18 and i
[1:46:12] read it for over a year
[1:46:14] by this stage and i get down to verse 22
[1:46:17] it says whosoever findeth the wife under
[1:46:19] the good thing and
[1:46:20] has obtained favor of the lord and the
[1:46:23] lord said christine's your wife the rest
[1:46:26] is history
[1:46:27] but the thing is she read that scripture
[1:46:29] the night before
[1:46:30] and the lord said see you're going to
[1:46:32] get married
[1:46:34] ben's going to be your husband answer
[1:46:35] but she's like lord can you show him
[1:46:37] so he took the same verse he took the
[1:46:40] same verse she had no idea i read
[1:46:41] proverbs
[1:46:42] he took the same verse and showed me
[1:46:43] from the same verse
[1:46:45] amen god works so so
[1:46:49] to me when he came down in that place in
[1:46:51] in christchurch
[1:46:52] god had this in mind didn't just have
[1:46:55] papua new guinea in mind he had this in
[1:46:57] mind
[1:46:58] hallelujah
[1:47:02] amen and you know so so we would start
[1:47:05] we would start going up there printing
[1:47:08] books setting them up and then we got
[1:47:10] invited to a little church
[1:47:11] up in the up in the sticks up there with
[1:47:13] no power or nothing and it's four by
[1:47:15] fouring just to get there
[1:47:16] and um you know that was where pastor
[1:47:19] emos was
[1:47:20] and the believers there and and that was
[1:47:22] the church that came into the message
[1:47:23] out of their denomination
[1:47:24] and i remember there's a brother now now
[1:47:26] this will mean a lot to me but it won't
[1:47:27] probably mean too much to you but
[1:47:28] you know there was an older brother
[1:47:30] there who um
[1:47:32] who his his wife owned the property that
[1:47:34] the church was on now for some reason
[1:47:36] over there
[1:47:37] you know uh landers passed through the
[1:47:40] through the
[1:47:41] woman instead of the men maybe because
[1:47:42] the men we used to get killed in battle
[1:47:44] all the time and the woman is still
[1:47:45] alive i don't know but
[1:47:46] anyway so he couldn't speak english but
[1:47:48] but he understood english and we were
[1:47:50] sitting outside the house and and we
[1:47:52] were talking about baptism
[1:47:54] and and and he he would say to me and
[1:47:56] you know pigeon
[1:47:58] you know him through it's true that's
[1:48:00] the right way to get baptized i need to
[1:48:01] get baptized
[1:48:02] he said about this message you know it's
[1:48:06] it is a true true word and as we're
[1:48:09] sitting there there's this eagle
[1:48:11] flying there's a puppet unity has an
[1:48:13] eagle uh i think it's the only time i've
[1:48:14] ever seen it it was flying up in the sky
[1:48:16] right above us
[1:48:17] i thought he's an eagle that's going to
[1:48:18] fly hallelujah
[1:48:20] answer anyway he was the one who got
[1:48:22] baptized hallelujah but you know he
[1:48:25] he passed on uh last year
[1:48:28] so to me now i'm expecting to see that's
[1:48:30] why i say this will mean a lot to me but
[1:48:32] probably not to you
[1:48:32] i'm expecting to see a young 18 to 21
[1:48:35] tolai man
[1:48:37] step through the door and he'll say okay
[1:48:40] so when they say
[1:48:41] let's go that they say you me go we're
[1:48:44] gonna go
[1:48:45] so he's going to step through the door
[1:48:46] and say you may go now and the rapture's
[1:48:48] going to be on
[1:48:49] hallelujah hallelujah you know i love
[1:48:53] that song i know the master of the wind
[1:48:54] i know the maker of the rain
[1:48:56] whenever i'd go up there it would be
[1:48:58] monsoon season
[1:49:00] and literally the roads become rivers
[1:49:03] and it'd have to be because um what
[1:49:06] would happen is say say it was a tar
[1:49:08] sealed road
[1:49:08] but then after a couple of ranges be
[1:49:10] dirt would just pile up then they had to
[1:49:12] get graders through and like basically
[1:49:13] just just make a new road and so
[1:49:16] whenever the rain would begin to come
[1:49:18] and i knew i was either going into
[1:49:19] toteval or coming out i'd say lord can
[1:49:21] you just send the rain away
[1:49:23] because if it's raining you can't get in
[1:49:25] and if it's raining you can't get out if
[1:49:27] you're in
[1:49:28] 4x4 because because the you know
[1:49:32] and and it would start raining and then
[1:49:34] it would just leave
[1:49:35] hallelujah and then i came back home and
[1:49:38] i emailed um you know
[1:49:40] i came back to new zealand you know
[1:49:42] after those trips and you know
[1:49:43] you know i emailed my parents said you
[1:49:44] know how's the weather how's everything
[1:49:46] and she said you know you know the roads
[1:49:48] are just like rivers
[1:49:50] who's ever been in monsoon country
[1:49:53] it doesn't just rain it rains
[1:49:56] and it rains and it rains and it rains
[1:50:00] even you've been in that kind of stuff
[1:50:02] so i know the maker of the wind i know
[1:50:04] that
[1:50:05] hallelujah people are looking at me why
[1:50:08] are you saying these things
[1:50:09] i'm killing the giant there's power and
[1:50:12] testimony
[1:50:14] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:50:16] the lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:50:19] hallelujah so there's great power in
[1:50:20] these things now
[1:50:23] that that house made ruth and i was
[1:50:25] thinking how am i going to say this so
[1:50:26] if sister biling top hears me say this
[1:50:28] this is not a
[1:50:29] bad thing of saying it but you know she
[1:50:31] was like sister beeling of papua new
[1:50:33] guinea she'd just talk and talk and talk
[1:50:34] nothing wrong with talking lots okay so
[1:50:36] but you know but then what would happen
[1:50:39] so so christy and i got married and we
[1:50:40] went up there for our honeymoon did a
[1:50:42] bit of a mission trip and stayed in the
[1:50:43] village and then we had a bit of holiday
[1:50:44] too
[1:50:45] had her own house there but you know
[1:50:47] when we when we met her there she was
[1:50:49] very quiet and withdrawn totally
[1:50:50] different person
[1:50:52] so what is wrong what is wrong with her
[1:50:54] and then she had this real bad limp
[1:50:55] and so we found out that she was
[1:50:57] carrying her outrigger canoe they would
[1:50:59] have these one-man kind of outrigger
[1:51:00] canoes they would take to the beach and
[1:51:02] they'd go fishing
[1:51:03] she was carrying it down the beach he
[1:51:04] fell over and dislocated her kneecap in
[1:51:06] such a way
[1:51:07] that the kneecap went up onto her leg
[1:51:10] and so she was taken to the hospital
[1:51:12] and they did x-rays and so on i didn't
[1:51:14] know this at the time but you know the
[1:51:16] tendons were snapped they had to operate
[1:51:18] but she said no no god's gonna heal me
[1:51:20] just just reset my kneecap
[1:51:22] and so they put the kneecap back but
[1:51:24] then she could barely bend her
[1:51:25] bent her leg um we actually have a video
[1:51:28] of that but i'll have to dig it out of
[1:51:29] some archive somewhere
[1:51:30] and um you know but then when we came
[1:51:33] and saw her she was very withdrawn
[1:51:34] didn't speak
[1:51:35] thought what is wrong and so we we we
[1:51:38] invited her to come come see us one
[1:51:40] night
[1:51:41] and we showed her the um so in my mind
[1:51:44] the lord's going to heal her leg and
[1:51:45] she's going to run out of that place
[1:51:48] but what happened was so so she came in
[1:51:50] we showed her brother gary walker's
[1:51:51] testimony
[1:51:52] who's seen that right and and we started
[1:51:55] talking to her about the reason this has
[1:51:57] happened is because you've received this
[1:51:58] word and the devil's not happy
[1:52:00] the devil gets mad when when a son or
[1:52:02] daughter of god begins to take their
[1:52:04] position
[1:52:05] and so we annoyed her her with oil and
[1:52:07] we prayed for her and she turned back to
[1:52:08] a happy talkative self
[1:52:10] hallelujah yep happy talking of self
[1:52:13] and then so and then what she said is
[1:52:15] that after she broke her leg or after
[1:52:17] she dislocated her kneecap and you know
[1:52:19] that happened
[1:52:19] she was laying in her in her house she
[1:52:21] said like a dark cloud came upon her
[1:52:24] and so as a spirit came upon her in her
[1:52:26] pain that's why you got to be careful
[1:52:27] when you get wounded by something that's
[1:52:30] when the devil because it's a weak spot
[1:52:31] the devil tries to get in
[1:52:33] but when we're telling her actually
[1:52:34] you're ordained for this word this is
[1:52:35] what you know you've received it yo this
[1:52:37] is you know there's a purpose for all
[1:52:38] this
[1:52:39] we prayed for you know that devil was
[1:52:41] cast out of her life
[1:52:42] but then she only but her leg was still
[1:52:44] the same but then i went back about a
[1:52:46] month or two later and she only had a
[1:52:48] slight limp
[1:52:49] and that's when she told us you know
[1:52:51] actually there were
[1:52:52] snap tendons in my leg that they had to
[1:52:54] be surgically reattached
[1:52:56] but she didn't but she didn't take the
[1:52:58] surgery now you know tendons are like
[1:53:00] springs if you snap them they go like
[1:53:01] this
[1:53:02] and they don't do this unless there's a
[1:53:04] surgeon
[1:53:05] whose name is jesus and does this
[1:53:08] hallelujah
[1:53:10] amen she had it she was looking after a
[1:53:12] little girl up there called channeler
[1:53:14] she was about three i think and she was
[1:53:16] this is one of the other times i was up
[1:53:17] there and she
[1:53:18] she was sick she had these big boils on
[1:53:20] her arm and she was very upset
[1:53:21] and you know we were up in total val we
[1:53:23] were you know having meetings up there
[1:53:25] and i said to ruth i said the reason
[1:53:27] this is happening is because
[1:53:28] because the devil doesn't want you here
[1:53:30] he wants you to take her to the hospital
[1:53:32] and stay there
[1:53:33] so he prayed for the little girl and i
[1:53:35] didn't realize at the time but she had
[1:53:36] malaria
[1:53:37] but after she was prayed for she didn't
[1:53:38] have malaria
[1:53:40] hallelujah and god and god touch your
[1:53:43] life
[1:53:44] and then i know i've stood here before
[1:53:46] and told you about the last uh last time
[1:53:48] we were up there
[1:53:49] where where my interpreter brother
[1:53:50] ronnie wasn't even a believer but he was
[1:53:52] invited to come to the meetings
[1:53:54] he was a he was a former pentecostal man
[1:53:56] and and he was interpreting for me you
[1:53:58] know because i was speaking english he
[1:54:00] was interpreting into
[1:54:01] into pidgin and and after the first
[1:54:03] service when i was closing in prayer
[1:54:05] he thought that i laid my hands upon his
[1:54:07] shoulders and and as i was praying
[1:54:09] there were hands on his shoulders and he
[1:54:11] asked me after the service did you put
[1:54:13] your hands
[1:54:13] on my shoulders when you were praying i
[1:54:15] said no i was i was praying like this
[1:54:18] and there's no one else on the platform
[1:54:19] there so to me it was the angel lord
[1:54:22] putting his hands on this man
[1:54:23] this word is for you and and i pray puts
[1:54:26] his hands on your shoulders today
[1:54:28] this message is for you this word is for
[1:54:30] you the resurrected lord jesus is for
[1:54:32] you
[1:54:33] hallelujah and then i begin to tell the
[1:54:34] people this message has returned us back
[1:54:36] to a true pentecost
[1:54:37] and he stopped translating for about
[1:54:39] three or four minutes because everyone
[1:54:40] stood up understood in their own
[1:54:42] language
[1:54:43] halloween they are so moved by these
[1:54:45] things amen
[1:54:46] why because we serve a god of reality we
[1:54:48] say you know he said well that's just
[1:54:50] the mission field

[1:54:54] actually give
[1:54:55] give give one more up there when i last
[1:54:58] went up there
[1:54:59] i started praying against the spirit of
[1:55:01] witchcraft because the people were being
[1:55:03] held back by something
[1:55:05] amen because because yeah a religious
[1:55:07] spirit is just it's just a rebellion
[1:55:09] it's a witchcraft
[1:55:10] so i started praying against those
[1:55:11] things amen and god and god began to
[1:55:13] break that power on the people and they
[1:55:15] begin to walk free amen hallelujah you

[1:56:19] christchurch and we were laying in bed
[1:56:21] talking about the lord
[1:56:22] and it was like the pillar of fire was
[1:56:24] just a few foot above us
[1:56:26] it was such an atmosphere that i thought
[1:56:28] we're going to rapture right now
[1:56:30] and i said to christine it's like he's
[1:56:32] just right there
[1:56:34] you know we've had surfaces where it's
[1:56:35] just gone milky white
[1:56:37] well i've actually opened my eyes and
[1:56:39] and i've been looking for angels because
[1:56:40] the atmosphere
[1:56:41] it actually looks milky hallelujah
[1:56:44] how god lives remember it's his
[1:56:47] testimony
[1:56:49] we should testify you know our our
[1:56:51] fellowship shouldn't just be about the
[1:56:52] things we're facing
[1:56:54] it should be about the god that's living
[1:56:56] it's good to talk about because you're
[1:56:58] saying how i'm going through this it's
[1:56:59] good to tell
[1:57:00] because they can say i'll pray for you
[1:57:02] because we're we're in this together
[1:57:04] right hallelujah we're in this together
[1:57:07] amen so we're about times like that
[1:57:09] you know we're you know who was
[1:57:12] yeah there's a few heather in the
[1:57:14] september earthquake in christchurch
[1:57:17] yeah somewhere there we were
[1:57:20] we were there and and what i love is the
[1:57:22] lord will keep us doesn't matter if the
[1:57:24] world's shaking or not
[1:57:26] and so and so our experience of that
[1:57:28] earthquake was we were both in bed it
[1:57:30] was about 40 in the morning
[1:57:31] and where we were living down madras
[1:57:33] street was a quiet
[1:57:34] part of the city but before the
[1:57:37] earthquake struck
[1:57:38] was like a freight train was just
[1:57:39] literally going through our house
[1:57:40] there's no trains around there's no
[1:57:42] trucks or anything and then the and then
[1:57:44] the earth started shaking
[1:57:45] and it wasn't just a gentle roll it was
[1:57:47] like this and it wasn't just going this
[1:57:49] way it was going this way
[1:57:51] and so somehow so so the place we were
[1:57:53] renting was a was a single bedroom place
[1:57:56] and the
[1:57:56] and the bedroom was a mezzanine above
[1:57:58] the rest of the unit somehow we got down
[1:58:00] to the front door
[1:58:02] and that year i think the haiti
[1:58:04] earthquake happened and so i began to
[1:58:06] thank god because i heard testimonies of
[1:58:08] what
[1:58:08] god delivered people supernaturally from
[1:58:10] that earthquake where they should have
[1:58:12] died in buildings but they got out and
[1:58:13] different things happen
[1:58:14] and so i began to thank god that he
[1:58:16] looks after his children and the prince
[1:58:18] of god came down so strong
[1:58:20] you know some people yo yo we were
[1:58:21] sharing with some people they came over
[1:58:22] for dinner you know they said weren't
[1:58:24] you scared and i said no we had a great
[1:58:25] time
[1:58:26] we had such a great time oh no it was it
[1:58:28] was awesome you know the lord came down
[1:58:29] in such a powerful way
[1:58:30] we were just rejoicing christine was
[1:58:32] just praising the lord and tongues
[1:58:34] rejoicing and you know
[1:58:35] the world was shaking but we were in the
[1:58:36] best place to be hallelujah
[1:58:40] amen to the lord will look after us
[1:58:44] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:47] and then we came up here and god's been
[1:58:50] living up here
[1:58:52] hallelujah the first house we lived in
[1:58:54] there was literally a devil in that
[1:58:55] house it used to be a brothel we didn't
[1:58:57] know that we found that
[1:58:58] out that after we moved out the day we
[1:59:01] were moving out the neighbors said you
[1:59:02] know there was a woman who used to live
[1:59:04] in this house
[1:59:04] and and she used it as a brothel and
[1:59:06] there was a dark spirit in that place it
[1:59:08] wasn't just a
[1:59:09] like a shadow moving around there was a
[1:59:10] demon and we started fighting
[1:59:13] it would be like such an oppression
[1:59:14] feeling would would would come upon me
[1:59:16] when i would see the house come back to
[1:59:18] the house
[1:59:18] so we realized something's wrong here we
[1:59:21] should have peace in our homes
[1:59:23] it shouldn't be an atmosphere of battles
[1:59:25] and stress and
[1:59:26] oppression and it's not a prison home is
[1:59:29] not a prison it should be a palace
[1:59:31] it should be a city of refuge it should
[1:59:33] be a like a batch on the lake or a beach
[1:59:35] or something you can just go
[1:59:36] sit and relax and rejoice and you know
[1:59:38] so there's this demon in this place
[1:59:40] and we begin to pray and and the prince
[1:59:43] of god you know
[1:59:44] came down one one time we were praying
[1:59:46] and i felt this fear come on us
[1:59:48] and now that wasn't god but when the
[1:59:50] enemy comes like a flight i'll raise up
[1:59:52] a standard
[1:59:53] and so i felt this fear come upon me and
[1:59:56] and i rebuked it in the name of jesus
[1:59:57] christ
[1:59:58] don't always go by your feelings right
[2:00:00] and then i looked over at christine and
[2:00:02] she was looking at the door
[2:00:03] uh fro from from out of the lounge with
[2:00:06] like a shot look on her face and she
[2:00:07] could see the thing standing there
[2:00:10] and we cast out in the name of jesus
[2:00:12] christ and there's such a peace in that
[2:00:13] home after that
[2:00:15] hallelujah amen and we've seen healings
[2:00:18] we've seen god do mighty things
[2:00:22] you know our god lives but they overcame
[2:00:24] him by the blood of the lamb
[2:00:26] and the word of their testimony amen
[2:00:29] you've been
[2:00:30] you better testify about the goodness of
[2:00:31] god amen and and the reality of him
[2:00:34] we've seen him heal we've seen the devil
[2:00:36] cast out i mean we've seen many things
[2:00:39] hallelujah i won't i won't continue in
[2:00:42] that vein but
[2:00:43] you know brother brown says this this is
[2:00:45] um wait what happened
[2:00:48] is it not there wait
[2:00:52] please hold technical difficulties but
[2:00:54] brother brown would relate a story
[2:00:58] of of when he was he was fishing with
[2:01:01] with the woods brothers
[2:01:02] and if you listen to the story the
[2:01:05] amount of things that brother ram said
[2:01:06] would happen before it happened is
[2:01:08] incredible
[2:01:09] and remember these are jehovah's
[2:01:10] witnesses some of them were actually
[2:01:12] saved but
[2:01:12] you know they were doubting about
[2:01:14] anything about you know this and it's
[2:01:16] wrong it's of the devil all this stuff
[2:01:18] but god would show them yeah brother
[2:01:20] rome said yeah we won't fish here
[2:01:21] because it'll be all muddy but we'll get
[2:01:22] to this place and you know he's
[2:01:24] specific about what he says about and it
[2:01:28] happened exactly that way you should go
[2:01:29] listen to it i think this is from
[2:01:30] believe
[2:01:31] uh there's a 1957 belief in the heart
[2:01:34] and so they're fishing now this is why i
[2:01:36] say fellowship's important
[2:01:38] you know some of well in my opinion i
[2:01:40] might be wrong but
[2:01:41] you know some of the best services that
[2:01:44] that that i've ever preached
[2:01:46] is because we've been talking about
[2:01:47] something and the lord comes down as
[2:01:49] we're talking and it just puts a thought
[2:01:51] in my heart
[2:01:52] we're just sitting around the coffee
[2:01:53] table at home talking you know you know
[2:01:55] what i love
[2:01:56] you know when you when you find the
[2:01:59] right one
[2:02:00] you never get sick of them you know you
[2:02:03] never think man i've spent too much time
[2:02:04] with her no no it's never that way
[2:02:06] it's so awesome i love it brother james
[2:02:08] is saying amen too you know
[2:02:10] it's just so nice you never ever get
[2:02:11] sick of your spouse
[2:02:14] you know friends sometimes hey you know
[2:02:16] we need some space but you know you know
[2:02:18] after a while but you know
[2:02:21] i hope everyone else understands what i
[2:02:23] mean if you need prayer afterwards we're
[2:02:25] here you know come
[2:02:27] but you know it's just so you know but
[2:02:28] you just begin to talk about the right
[2:02:30] kind of things
[2:02:31] and the lord drops down and begins to
[2:02:33] inspire
[2:02:35] amen guests begin to operate amen
[2:02:38] hallelujah
[2:02:38] so here they are they're fishing and
[2:02:41] that afternoon sitting back there
[2:02:43] brother would begin to speak about an
[2:02:44] old woman that used to belong to the
[2:02:46] anderson church of god up here
[2:02:47] when they were in their bloom how good
[2:02:50] said how
[2:02:51] she used to take them little jehovah's
[2:02:53] witness boys and love them
[2:02:54] and brother wood said to his brother lol
[2:02:56] he said lyle
[2:02:58] would it not be great now if we could go
[2:02:59] up and find that old sister and let her
[2:03:01] know that we're safe
[2:03:02] so they're just fishing they're talking
[2:03:04] about the lord and and and
[2:03:06] he just because this is now the desire
[2:03:08] of his heart i've met him
[2:03:11] she knew him i want i want her to know
[2:03:13] i've met him too
[2:03:14] hallelujah it's the same thing you meet
[2:03:17] him you want the world to meet him
[2:03:18] you know your friends or colleagues at
[2:03:20] work you think wouldn't it be nice if
[2:03:21] they just knew the lord
[2:03:23] or someone who knows the lord i want to
[2:03:25] go tell them about it yeah
[2:03:28] now that word found favor with god
[2:03:32] after being talking about god for a long
[2:03:34] time but that word
[2:03:36] found favor amen
[2:03:40] those two jehovah witness boys both him
[2:03:42] age men wanting to find out
[2:03:44] find an old woman and tell her that they
[2:03:46] were saved two brothers
[2:03:48] uh when they said that the spirit of god
[2:03:51] and his sovereignty fell on me
[2:03:52] that's what a gift is being operated now
[2:03:55] sitting there in that boat oh i wish i
[2:03:57] i could have voiced some way and i could
[2:03:59] sink that into the people's hearts i
[2:04:00] could no more control myself
[2:04:02] then you could fly to the moon just by
[2:04:04] that word i said boys
[2:04:06] there's something fixing to happen it's
[2:04:08] a little animal of some sort
[2:04:10] it'll be brought to life there's going
[2:04:11] to be life connected with it
[2:04:13] and you will see it right away
[2:04:17] and that did happen because those two
[2:04:18] one-state believers they didn't go back
[2:04:20] to jehovah's witness
[2:04:22] but you see what they were talking about
[2:04:25] that word found favor with god
[2:04:28] and god did the supernatural hallelujah
[2:04:33] so that's why i say how important is
[2:04:36] that they overcame him by the blood lamb
[2:04:37] and the word of their testimony
[2:04:39] where we can talk about the goodness of
[2:04:41] god and what he's done
[2:04:42] and god can say i enjoy that fellowship
[2:04:45] i'm going to step into that fellowship
[2:04:46] i'm going to i'm going to anoint the
[2:04:48] gift in their life
[2:04:49] that god is going to step on the scene
[2:04:51] and do something supernatural
[2:04:53] amen god will do more than just talking
[2:04:55] about things but god will come and do
[2:04:57] hallelujah glory amen
[2:05:00] this is you say well that was with the
[2:05:02] prophet
[2:05:03] isn't the bride gifted aren't there
[2:05:06] gifts in the body
[2:05:08] that just having fellowship can tap into
[2:05:10] god can actually activate that gift just
[2:05:12] because we're talking about the lord
[2:05:14] amen hallelujah because we can have
[2:05:16] things so caught up in our mind how
[2:05:18] things will happen and what's going to
[2:05:19] happen
[2:05:20] but then we can just we can just say a
[2:05:22] word
[2:05:23] and find favor it's like had he right
[2:05:27] you know she she just said to brother
[2:05:29] branham
[2:05:30] after after he explained the squirrels
[2:05:32] how did that happen
[2:05:34] and he and and she wasn't saying it
[2:05:36] because she didn't believe but she was
[2:05:37] interested
[2:05:39] i want to know about that i want details
[2:05:41] how'd this happen
[2:05:42] and she and and they were talking about
[2:05:45] what god was doing
[2:05:46] and then she said that's nothing but the
[2:05:48] truth brother branham and then god came
[2:05:50] down said ask what you will and it shall
[2:05:51] be done what
[2:05:52] she found favor with god hallelujah she
[2:05:55] didn't plan on finding favor with god
[2:05:57] she just said i believe that testimony
[2:06:00] how did it happen that's nothing but the
[2:06:02] truth
[2:06:03] hallelujah and you've got the salvation
[2:06:04] of your two boys
[2:06:07] amen hallelujah
[2:06:11] so now i say that's why the right kind
[2:06:14] of fellowship is important
[2:06:18] amen he said well we've got giants to
[2:06:22] kill
[2:06:23] i'm just going to leave it right there
[2:06:28] these giants are going gonna die
[2:06:31] they have an expiry date whatever you're
[2:06:33] facing in your life whatever you're
[2:06:35] going through
[2:06:35] i say we are a generation that have been
[2:06:38] risen up
[2:06:40] brother brown killed goliath he yo he he
[2:06:42] took care of that thing
[2:06:44] right but because people die but spurs
[2:06:46] don't die
[2:06:47] that same spirit has tried to come upon
[2:06:49] this generation
[2:06:50] to say the days of miracles have passed
[2:06:53] hallelujah that all you have to do is
[2:06:55] just be raised in church be a good
[2:06:57] person maybe
[2:06:58] you know definitely get baptized but
[2:07:00] meeting him is the thing
[2:07:02] amen he is a god of miracles he's a god
[2:07:04] of the supernatural
[2:07:06] now you don't have to compare you know
[2:07:08] i'm not trying to say you've got to have
[2:07:10] my testimony we all have an individual
[2:07:12] testimony
[2:07:13] but the outward but the finality of the
[2:07:15] testimony is that god lives
[2:07:17] and i love his word i love him and i
[2:07:19] love the brethren and i want to be more
[2:07:20] like him
[2:07:22] hallelujah but the thing is our god
[2:07:25] lives
[2:07:26] hallelujah and i'm convinced now
[2:07:28] remember this is just maybe i just got
[2:07:30] to kill some giants tonight sorry i used
[2:07:31] to sunday morning to deal with something
[2:07:33] in my own life
[2:07:34] but that same god that met me back in
[2:07:36] christchurch is very much the same god
[2:07:38] that's here today hallelujah
[2:07:40] and personally myself now this is not
[2:07:43] the end of the year and i'll probably
[2:07:44] repeat it at the end of the year
[2:07:45] 2020 has been the best year spiritually
[2:07:47] for me
[2:07:50] i found it good i had such a complex
[2:07:53] going into camp
[2:07:55] i shouldn't even go up the front
[2:07:57] shouldn't say anything
[2:07:58] i'll just get in the way no honestly
[2:08:03] but i had to do it i said lord
[2:08:07] i'm just going up there i had no joy
[2:08:10] you know but that but that well that
[2:08:13] saturday
[2:08:14] friday night at camp i went up you know
[2:08:17] people were called up for prayer
[2:08:19] i went up to get prayed for not to pray
[2:08:21] for people oh my god
[2:08:23] hallelujah and brother tears i i great i
[2:08:25] said can you pray for me
[2:08:26] you know and then and then the saturday
[2:08:28] evening
[2:08:30] i just went up there said lord here i
[2:08:31] come amen
[2:08:33] and the lord met me as i was walking up
[2:08:35] there i got my joy back
[2:08:37] i got yo because the devil the devil
[2:08:39] doesn't want we're all gifted people
[2:08:41] right we all have a gift amen we have a
[2:08:44] gift to bring heaven down upon the earth
[2:08:46] may not be to sing it may not be to play
[2:08:48] or preach but we have a gift in our life
[2:08:50] that god can come down
[2:08:52] hallelujah who brought who brought this
[2:08:54] fish back to life
[2:08:55] it was those two not the prophet those
[2:08:58] two caused that to happen
[2:08:59] talking about the lord they brought a
[2:09:02] resurrection of life
[2:09:03] because they were talking about the
[2:09:05] right thing
[2:09:06] they were just full of the goodness of
[2:09:08] god hallelujah
[2:09:10] and so we we all have a gift to bring
[2:09:13] them on the earth i believe it
[2:09:15] but the devil doesn't want us to live in
[2:09:17] that realm because in that realm he gets
[2:09:19] defeated
[2:09:21] he wants to keep us on a natural just a
[2:09:23] church level but we're not ordained to
[2:09:25] live in some kind of church level
[2:09:27] what's church level you keep church
[2:09:29] ordering that's it
[2:09:32] no that's that we have church order we
[2:09:34] must have church over don't stay there
[2:09:36] the this is the mechanics but we need
[2:09:38] the dynamics to come down into the
[2:09:40] mechanics
[2:09:41] right that's the main thing although
[2:09:43] that's the main thing is
[2:09:44] as the dynamics comes down supercharges
[2:09:46] our faith
[2:09:47] then whatever we have need of is
[2:09:48] manifested in our lives
[2:09:50] amen because remember we're a
[2:09:51] supernatural people
[2:09:54] not a natural people we're a
[2:09:55] supernatural people and we know a
[2:09:56] supernatural god
[2:09:58] that's the same yesterday today and
[2:09:59] forever
[2:10:01] hallelujah so
[2:10:04] we've got to get out of our comfort zone
[2:10:07] see me
[2:10:09] i'm sure everyone knows me but you know
[2:10:11] me i'm very much
[2:10:13] i can shell up really easily withdrawal
[2:10:16] very easily this is you
[2:10:17] humanly now you know just just plod
[2:10:20] along
[2:10:22] i'm glad no one's saying amen
[2:10:24] christine's in the back room anyway
[2:10:26] you know but the thing is you can get
[2:10:28] stuck in a way of being
[2:10:30] but that's not the way god wants you to
[2:10:32] be god wants us remember his life comes
[2:10:34] into us that it will go to others
[2:10:37] virtue will flow healing virtue will
[2:10:39] flow
[2:10:40] deliverance will floor and that's and
[2:10:41] that's all of us remember we're here for
[2:10:43] one another
[2:10:44] every joint supplier to the body
[2:10:48] so i'm not here for me i'm here for you
[2:10:50] you're not here for you you're here for
[2:10:51] me
[2:10:53] we all need one another right but we
[2:10:55] need to say lord may it not just me
[2:10:57] be me carnally being a believer may you
[2:11:00] come anoint
[2:11:01] my life hallelujah that we can look back
[2:11:05] and say
[2:11:07] amen we've overcome by the blood lamb
[2:11:09] and word of our testimony
[2:11:11] hallelujah that he lives
[2:11:14] amen do you say well
[2:11:18] so that's me but you know that's like
[2:11:21] brother
[2:11:22] i think brother freddie or brother ferdi
[2:11:23] said yeah it's like our our first nature
[2:11:25] is not far behind us yes
[2:11:27] so we're going to be very aware of those
[2:11:29] things that's why we're going to die
[2:11:31] daily
[2:11:33] amen but we have overcoming power
[2:11:38] amen we have overcoming power you know
[2:11:41] i've been driving
[2:11:42] you know i drive half an hour one way to
[2:11:44] work every day i love my drive
[2:11:46] if i'm stuck in traffic praise a lot
[2:11:49] going to work
[2:11:50] coming home not so much i like to get
[2:11:52] home i love getting home but you know
[2:11:54] but the lord has said to me he said you
[2:11:56] know but you can have greater services
[2:11:58] than this
[2:11:59] you can have greater we can have greater
[2:12:04] we can have greater times in the lord
[2:12:06] now it may
[2:12:07] not manifest all the same way but we can
[2:12:10] have a greater time
[2:12:12] you know it's good we have our
[2:12:13] expectation but let's let's increase our
[2:12:16] expectation
[2:12:17] amen we can have a greater walk than
[2:12:19] what we have
[2:12:21] god can live more than what he has amen
[2:12:25] amen so i'm like lord amen
[2:12:28] remember because because if he wants us
[2:12:30] to have a greater time with him
[2:12:32] that's him saying i want you higher i
[2:12:34] want you to come where i am in a greater
[2:12:36] way
[2:12:36] i don't want you just to be there come
[2:12:38] up here come up higher
[2:12:41] hallelujah and the reason that he would
[2:12:42] say such things now this is just me is
[2:12:44] because he's
[2:12:45] greater to have amen it's not us trying
[2:12:47] to say well how can we manufacture that
[2:12:49] no
[2:12:49] we just got to give more brother brown
[2:12:51] gave the most complex well
[2:12:53] you know mysterious answer the most
[2:12:54] simple answer when he was asked how do
[2:12:56] these visions come
[2:12:57] he says i just yield i get myself out of
[2:12:59] the way
[2:13:00] and the more we can get ourselves out of
[2:13:02] the way the more god can operate
[2:13:04] so if you want to get out of the way 10
[2:13:06] he'll work 10
[2:13:08] 20 20 he will give you he will work with
[2:13:10] whatever you give him
[2:13:13] so let's give 100.
[2:13:18] you know even not even in just these
[2:13:20] four walls but in our family life i give
[2:13:22] a hundred percent
[2:13:24] i give 100 to my children to my spouse
[2:13:26] 100
[2:13:27] all that i am i don't live for myself
[2:13:29] i'm not here for me i'm here for
[2:13:31] everyone else
[2:13:32] that he would live because you know what
[2:13:35] i love about it

[2:15:31] this prayer for he will never be
[2:15:38] forgotten throughout his
[2:15:45] eternal days
[2:15:48] on the mount of
[2:15:52] crucifixion
[2:16:02] fountains
