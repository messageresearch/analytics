no way to be found in the sea of god's forgetfulness o lord jesus thank you that we can gather lord hear tonight that we can sing songs of zion lord that we can worship the living god lord we ask that you'll just be with us now as we open this sermon as we open this preaching in the word of god lord in the name of our lord jesus christ lord there's no point we're here lord and you're not here lord you know this week you know everything that was set before not just me but every believer that made it here lord lord and we came for one reason one reason alone lord is to hear from our god lord and to worship our god and to praise our god lord jesus so you come down and lord you take this service and you make it yours lord for that is why we come lord i pray you will be with us all now and for the rest of the service in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen thank you brother andy god bless you musicians you can have your seats i put everything there for you amen i want to start off just by saying what a week i don't want to know how brother ben feels every sunday or every saturday that he needs to prepare before he gets here i've never in my life have been under so much physical and spiritual attack than this week i'm glad that i made it the devil today said you will not make it because you've got sinus it was so bad at a stage i wanted to collapse but i'm here you know the word of god will always go forth you know we sing how great is our god because it's actually about him it's not about us we don't come here for another reason but him so the devil will hinder you and will hinder you and will distract you as much as he can because he don't want you here but we're here we made it amen stupid devil you know what it's under your feet and hopefully tonight by god's grace we can go in these these two types or three types of believers but these two people that really seek god these people that seek him sincerely and then these people that seeks him with everything in them through sincerity these two types sincere people can miss the very presence of god in their life for being too sincere and too closed off so keep your minds open tonight as we go through the scriptures i've got a little bit of reading to do actually a lot of scripture but i'll try to go through the scriptures because i want to keep the thought but i'm going to have to paint the one side before i paint the other side which is us all of us because as much as we are here there is only one time where god comes on your road and he speaks to you personally and i don't want to go ahead but he speaks to you personally and that's experience and a moment between you and god that no man can take away no man can change it no man can can say it hasn't happened there's a point in your life where god calls you and he touches you in such a way that you cannot be the same amen so let's let's go into the scripture i want to go to the scripture of luke 20 and we're not going to read there from verses 1 to um 8. lord help me please you just pray for me tonight um luke 20 um chapter 20 and we're going to start from verse 1. i don't know how the service is going to end i didn't work on that but amen praise the lord kind of lift that up to the lord amen that's how we do it so it's not on there but i'll show you luke tweeny and everybody there say amen so this so luke 19 jesus is on his way to israel and they get a mule he says go get the mule and they'll give him tell the master wants the mule because i have to go into jerusalem so he's on his way to jerusalem the most holiest city where god himself wants to go and show more of himself to his brethren now he's done many miracles before luke 20. there was blind sea death here dead raised everything has happened before this luke 20. so miracles it was in abundance it wasn't that they didn't know god was with this man there was miracles they could see the full manifestation of god on this earth if they just stood and looked at the ministry of jesus christ so but this is the this is the mindset and this is the whole thing about the pharisees and the sadducees is they've got a mindset and and there's something here that they they can't see what's going on because somehow they're blinded and we know jesus blinded them but there's something that when the very god was standing in front of them they just could not see it they were devout men they knew their bible they knew the messiah's coming they knew the prophecies they knew everything that was happening and being fulfilled they knew it wasn't the scriptures but somehow something kept them occupied i i might even say it this way events in their world at that time kept them occupied and jesus was walking and jesus was healing and jesus was saving and jesus was helping and jesus was praying for them but because they looked so much at their realm they could not see it amen so we go and it says and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple so he's in jerusalem now and he preached the gospel the chief priest and the scribes came upon him with the elders so so the meaning of this word upon or the definition upon it i'm just going to follow in my in my bible let me just get the 20. and if you look at the strong concordance it says when you come upon one is to stand by be present to stand over one place oneself above so this means when they came with the scribes and with with all these leaders and the chief priest they came with the authority they came with a how can i say uh they came with the attitude of you know we're greater than thou who are you so so the whole attitude of them approaching the word of god jesus in flesh just the whole attitude says when they came to him they came upon him so they didn't come to find really out what was going on they came from a position of authority down at jesus so so see where they are they're in this religious realm coming down to the word of god to find out what the word is doing there and they spake unto him saying tell us by what authority does thou do these things so jesus of nazareth you give you the right to come and do miracles who gives you the right to come and stand in our synagogue without having a teaching and tell everybody about god who gives you that right and he answered them and he said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men or of men and they reasoned with themselves now see the first thing they do instead of just just giving him the answer we're now going to start reasoning because we need to give this guy answer he's one we many we've got all the scholars we can get but let us just get together and in our heads reason it all out and then give him his answer and they try this they've got they've got they've got the priests the pharisees the guys that knows the torah they can pin a prick through the torah and tell you what's on the other side of that pin basically they knew their word but let us quickly reason together because we need more than one to answer this one this one and i'm just going to say it one more time this one and they reasons by themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say when then believed him not why did you believe him not but when we say of men all the people will stone us for they perceive they were persuaded that john was a prophet and they answered that they could not tell him whence it was and jesus said to them neither tell are you by what authority i do this amen god bless you you may take your seats and he said unto them he says neither tell are you by what authority i do these things so jesus don't clown around for no one he's the word standing in front of people that was supposed to know the word so the title for tonight's sermon um is god is calling your name he's calling and i had such a wonderful time at work i knew i was going to make it here because last night when i was preparing man it was i cannot explain it to you guys i cannot explain the the how tough it was i just want to say it because you get to a point where you get so desperate because you want to hear something from god and it's there's nothing and you have all these thoughts and and and as a brother ben god bless you for being in your position brother andy god bless you brother isaac god bless you brother all the brothers that preach all the brothers that that come up here and just just give a little bit of a word and say bless you because it is man it's such a fight sometimes so god bless you i pray that you will just in every time you prepare please let us know so we can pray with you because i needed it so i was thinking about a certain character in the bible and i will come to it later and and maybe a bit of a lengthy service but please follow me because i'm so nervous i was thinking about this one character and i kept going back to this one character and one character and one character and i said lord but with all these things how does this character fit into your service because i've i've been through the book of luke this month and what a wonderful time i had in there but there's this one character and i cannot place him in where my train of thought goes until this morning amen amen okay so let's jump in there so in john so so here is the pharisees now look at the state of mind look at these pharisees they in front of the word they they come with a certain way and this is just i have to give the negative build a little bit so i can give the positive so we can have a jubilee praise the lord and i still don't know who's going to end so here's the pharisees and they come to jesus and they basically challenging jesus on the word which he asked him a simple question back and they don't know their word they can't answer him and and and the whole thing that i keep seeing here is is they quickly go to their people and they quickly reason about things that's going on they always reason they always reason there's no let's go search the scripture and let's go see how this stacks up and and where's the prophecies and they never go for me and this is just me and fellowship they never go back to this i don't see them go and sit and say hey let's go through the prophecies and say yeah and the prophet joel said this and and all this was a virgin shall conceive and you know all these things that's busy happening and miracles the blind will see that their full year the dead will be raised god is back here it comes with healing in his wings all these prophecies john the baptist that came before him all these things are lining up are we missing your boys what are we missing but instead they stuck to that religious spirit i know all of it so jesus and and here is is nicodemus and nicodemus in john 3 he says there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came unto jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know not what we know not we know that thou art a teacher come from god amen for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered him and now jesus comes with something because because now nicodemus he professes that yes we see the miracles yes we see the healing yes god is with you now jesus comes and he says to him okay jesus answers him and say very verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god you can't see it you need to be born again now nicodemus he's in a carnal realm he's in his own line of thinking so again not spiritually minded just what did jesus say to me why would he say i need to be born again this is impossible and he goes and he says nicodemus says unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born so we where is the pharisees where are those scholars the people that are leading people where are their minds in the carnal realm so they can only judge by the carnal realm they can only see events in carnality don't see the spiritual they've long lost the spiritual they lived there the days of miracles are over oh it's happening now yeah but this explanation be else above right there must be a different reason that miracles happen and i'm going to bring it into our day to day days and miracles are over said who said who we had little liam mounter we had an event with that young man there was a dog that's stuck by that man by that young kid and the testimony i pray one day you share it because it's such a powerful testimony brother ben that dog stuck with him and he brought him all the way back all the way back you tell me days of miracles are over it's because we work in a corner realm we think oh yeah but it's one out of fifty chance or one of a hundred chance if you knew all the circumstances around that event it is a miracle it is absolutely a miracle god is a miracle working god but see if we stay in the carnal realm we will miss it and how many miracles slip past us every day that we miss because we are carnally minded because we are in a realm where we we reason in carnality we we reason with the things that's going on covert all these nonsense and who's the next politician and that vaccine and no vaccine and is there another one and you know this vaccine is like is there is it him is there another they just want to keep going and taking more listen forget about those things it's keeping you busy and it it's distracting you all of us me too i mean hello i'm preaching just in general most of this came to me so i'm digesting give me chance and jesus answered him so he's answering his question that says can i be born again and he says very verily i say unto thee except the man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god so god jesus himself saying water baptism is the way to start the journey you you have to start somewhere so i i was never ever gonna put this in but it's in so here we are so why would god say to him you need to be born of water blood spirit the three like a baby coming to the world you get the water in the blood and then the spirit goes into the baby why would the pattern change why would it change so here he says the word comes to him and he says that which is born of the flesh is the flesh and which is born of the spirit is the spirit of it marvel not i say unto thee ye must be born again so now jesus comes and he gives him the answer you need to take the first step and the first step is baptism so i'll give you a little bit of my testimony before i got baptized i didn't understand that the lord used my wife in a mighty way to to bring me into this this gospel and i praise the lord and and if you ever have a a wife that that loves the lord and and just keep praying for your husband's and husband if your wife don't love the lord keep praying for her because god can and will do it if you just can just hold on all things are possible only believe so we my wife decides she wants to be baptized and she's reading the supernatural books and and it comes over the pulpit time and again and because i'm sitting in a carnal realm i don't quite understand what is going on with this whole baptism thing you know why is it so important i was dedicated i was baptized as a baby what's so significant on it but something i don't think of is why is it such a hard decision why in the name of jesus christ why is it so hard to go and say i want to follow jesus i want to go and i want to say to a demon get out in the name of jesus christ i want to rebuke him and all things i want to do i want to do in the name of jesus but when it comes to taking his name something in me goes oh no but i you know father son holy ghost you know except i'm baptized i was sprinkled but hey you know almost drowned there i was like too small so so why am i now fighting this whole baptism thing and children listen it's going to come your way get your attention wake up the baptism question will always come your way because that's just the first step it's not going to change your life overnight like this can oh wow because once you pick a side and you choose which side you're on and you choose who you're going to be married to then all hell breaks loose don't think once you said lord i love you and i want to be baptized all's going to go well you pick the site the devil goes gotcha you just made this big target of jesus christ right on your back on the front of you on your head to your toe because now you actually chose the right side not a title not not father son and holy ghost and how i understood it is is and this is how it was revealed to me when my wife said to her i don't want to be married i am now a father i used to be a son and one day when i pass to the other realm and it's not the rapture i don't change the body it will be a supernatural body it will be i'll be a ghost spirit okay spirit being but i know we have bodies there waiting for us but just hear me out follow the train so what's my name what is my name my name is not father though my little one calls me dada my name is not son so my dad calls me his son and when i die and they say oh they lace poor spirit no there is armand rest in peace so my name is armand so when i want to use the name of jesus christ and i want to call him on the scene shouldn't i be married to that one first because if you don't have the ring you don't have the authority he said and in acts 2 38 paul's uh paul says he says and peter said he says repent and be baptized for the remissions of of sin in the name of our lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and i've referred in my notes and you shall be filled with the holy ghost okay but i'm going to read it to you because you know i don't want to get it wrong because it's the word of god so acts 2 38 and that and i had it but i just kind of lost that train of thought it said and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the ghost the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and all that are after off even as many as the lord our god shall call so he's still calling okay so now my wife she's to me that i need to be baptized because because that's the step one so i walk to the water we say to brother ben we want to be baptized and we get to the sermon in the morning it's a sunday morning and we choose the nicest we're going to choose a nice sunday and everything and every kind of thing is going to be so nice you know the sun's going to shine the birds is going to tweet and oh it's just going to be a glorious day and all the best photos will be taken and this is really in my mind i'm thinking amen this is going to be event we showed up to church and brother andy prayed for water because the river was so low it was you that prayed for water was it brother ben somebody prayed for water in the river because the river was too low and we couldn't baptize where the usual spot was so they said lord just let it please rain so there can be water so we can have a baptism man did it rain it didn't even rain it was cold we were sitting at church with the heaters on well now the heat is on because now i have to choose you know we're looking at the widow we were still downstairs and we're sitting right the back corner we're looking out the window and i remember going is this not how i planned this and vince preaching and just before he goes he goes um we have a baptism today brother romantic sister chantel they decided to be baptized and praise the lord you know yes i'm going we call back out now no excuse is gonna get around this one you know except for maybe going down with the river but it was flowing so so we get here to the water and it's under the bridge there by stokes valley beautiful place this man had some wonderful times here and now we get to the river and it's cold and it doesn't stop raining and it's still busy and we're under the bridge and the water's dropping everywhere because it's big drops now not small drops because you're under the bridge all the water is coming down and we're all standing there in this pool of water and ben gets first in the water but you should have seen his he didn't he didn't just go in he waited carefully okay try to get his feet and the water is flowing but there's one pool where the water just turns a little bit and then goes out slow and we choose that pool and i go into the water and and don't know why i shared it so indeed but i want to tell you something and there was a photo taken before i was baptized and i'll share it on the brothers and sisters because i think you should see it there was fear on my face fear the display there was no display of i'm giving it all over there was fear on my face because i knew that i knew once that i go under i ain't coming back the same amen i knew and something in me and this is what i want to say to you as well if you're born and shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies that is what's within you before you take on his name that's scared because when legion came to to to jesus he fell at his feet but he first asked him have you come to torment us before our time they were scared there was fear and and i could see it in my face and and when i went down and i came up i couldn't feel my head couldn't feel my eyes couldn't feel my ears i could feel nothing it was so cold but i did it and i said ben said can i pray and he started praying and we prayed together and i walked out and i took my wife's hand and i had the privilege of leading my wife into the water and she got baptized and the wednesday they broke into our house and they stole our tv and my xbox and everything that kept us busy stole it all right so if there's some some juniors here that wants to get baptized please i can arrange them to come and steal your stuff at your house hey amen it's not an inside job but it was an inside job because god knew that that oh man we were so angry but god knew that once we picked aside he's going to start doing the work and he just chose some poor fellow to break into my house to take my stuff away he chose that guy predestinated to do it because he wanted me to clear out anything that could get between me and him because i've now picked aside if i now went back into my old routine then i would put his work that much further back and he's in the job of finishing what he started okay amen wasn't going to preach that but there it is amen so now when i look at the pharisees and i'm in the and i know still in the book of luke um and we were at luke 20 then and we're going to go there from verse 9. so so then i see the attitude of the pharisees and jesus sees it as well and now he's going to warn them he actually god almighty gives everyone a fair chance he's not an unrighteous god he's not a mean god he gives all of us a fair chance you need to seek out your salvation you but so he sees what's in their heart he sees in what realm they're operating and he thought let me just pull out this this little parable and i just give it to them so maybe that their eyes can open so that they can see what's going on here and this is actually what i wanted to preach a bit he says and then he began verse 9 began to speak to the people and he spoke this parable a certain man planted a vineyard and led it forth to a husbandman so a husbandman the definition i have is someone that tolls the soil so when the master leaves the place he takes care of the master stuff so he's in control of all that the master has and his job is to fill the soil and reap the harvest that's his job he's a minister the pharisees were ministers and he is basically telling them that your job is to till the ground to win souls for god you're missing it and they just get angry you'll see he says and he went into a far country a long off and maybe i'll just i'll just have it i'll talk about it okay because because i don't want to read it or i'm not the best of bible reader there is like nicely i miss a couple of words and i don't want to miss words of word of god so he goes off from the far country and then he he goes and if we go there and he says and he sends a servant to the husbandman that they should give him off the fruit of the vineyard his vineyard so the first one comes there and they say sorry and they beat him they beat him and they send them away with nothing so the first messenger from the king of kings comes down i say say boys lord wants his harvest he wants his children what do we have here they beat him and they send the prophet away one prophet down now he says and he sent another servant and they beat him also and then entreated him shamefully so now see how wicked they go as time goes by these guys just get more wicked every time god does something this lord of the vineyard he does something and they keep on going more more wicked isn't this the world we live in right now so the second one come and they say treat him shamefully and to treat him shamefully in the strong concordance if you go there it says to dishonor insult trees treat with contempt and then it says it's whether it's in word or deed or thought see jesus is the discerner of the heart and the intent of the heart so so he sees not just your actions he doesn't see your words he sees what's in here so that's how they treated the servant really really bad so they thought bad of him looked bad at him and then they they send him away empty again a third and now they wounded him and they cast him out so it went from just giving him a pak's law sending him off then giving him a hiding and treating him really bad and now they wound him what's next and now jesus is trying to get the pharisees attention to say hey scripture is going to be fulfilled this is where you're at and then he changes and he says but then he says but then the lord of the vineyards said what shall i do what can i do that can help these people see again to the pharisees and they say i will send my son because they will have reverence they'll know that he's from me they will treat him good and they will they will hearken unto his voice and so he send them out and then when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves see again religious spirit reasoning the word comes this way the son of god is in front of the jews saying hey i'm here you can have millennium right now we can change it all right now no scripture but you have that choice but we're still going to reason we're still going to reason what's going on now we still want a reason why this vaccine why not that why is it coding why is it that we're still going to reason just under this and this that and this one and that one we're still going to reason what we're in how the work's going to be what's next week what nets we we want to reason everything so we can understand it so we can move on but are you then led by the spirit of god being led is like a sheep you just surrender you just say lord i don't know i don't know i don't know where to go today i don't know who to see today i don't know what you want to accomplish in my life i've got all these notes i don't know what to do with it i've got a brother or sister that worked i want to testify to them i don't know how to do it i don't know that's the attitude of a christian it's like a lamb but these guys they want a reason they want to go to the best minister they want to go to the best guy that's got the most knowledge about the message they can give them all the quotes in this type of thing so that they can out quote the next one they're missing the very point that the message is pointing them to the lord of the vineyard to his son to the one that is introducing to say hey guys don't get caught up in mental telepathy if i can say or mental gymnastics if we can say that don't get caught up in the carnality don't be super spiritual to try and over figure everything out be led by the spirit of god so remember the sermon's name is the sermon is called he's calling your name just stay with that please because i'm jumping a bit around where i shouldn't so they killed him then he said he said would the husband will not come and destroy them and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard them they say god forbid and beheld them and and jesus bealed them and he beat out them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the boldest rejected the same is became the headstone of the corner whosoever shall fall upon this stone shall be broken but whosoever shall fall it shall fall on it will grind it to powder so i repeat that last bit but on whosoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so now the pharisees have a choice and they can now choose and then this is afterwards it says and the chief priest and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he have spoken this parable against them well now you're getting it boys god is trying to warn you hey you know there's ref to come for the choices you make time is running out scripture is going to be fulfilled but i'm still going to give you a choice to repent i'm still going to give you a choice to to to choose life and not death but that's carnal it's carnal amen so then thinking of this and i know it's all negative but we're getting there brothers please have mercy um then make me think of lazarus so then i'm thinking man this sounds so familiar what about lazarus lazarus the poor man that was at the rich man's gate just wanted to have some of those bread crumbs and here lazarus dies the rich man dies lazarus goes to heaven in the bosom of father abraham the rich man is in hell see what i'm trying to say the rich man it says here that he was arrayed in fine linen and he was they call it feared f-a-r-e-d ferret and and that fear it means that he was joyful he was happy he was content and then after that they said say something like uh some to you some to it something can you put that on uh go to luke 16 verse 19. maybe andy can give me this word because i can't pronounce it as well but it says there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and in fine linen and feared and sumptuously every day so when i looked at the word sumptuously means without need there's nothing if you look at the strong concordance on it he's happy he's joyful and he's so happy that he's joyful there's nothing wrong is that right sumptuously thank you very much brother andy man god bless the brothers they can speak english so so he was in a happy place okay it didn't say it was a believer didn't say it was an unbeliever he was contained okay he had everything he wanted but he had a beggar at his gate somebody wanting food spiritual whatever he had someone that was in need so then they both died he sees lazarus and and the bosom of father abraham and he cease to because he's now in hell and he says to father abraham can you just ask lazarus just to run a drop of water on his finger to me and brother and brother abraham abraham says i cannot do it there's a chasm between me and you we can't come there and now it dawns on him that whoa whoa in verse 27 i've got brothers look this place is horrible i've got brothers and and you need to go warn them now all of a sudden he changed his whole approach and he says to he says to him for i he says and he said i pray thee therefore father verse 27 that thou would send him to my father's house for i have five brothers that they may testify and at least that they don't come to this place of torment don't let my brothers come you just send someone to go please and abraham said unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them it's harsh man he just wants his family saved but he says there's a message i've sent and there's a prophet i took time to send to you in the right time to give you a message to introduce you to me so that you do not go into this place but they chose to follow other things because they were still operating in that carnal realm and then he said nay father abraham but if one unto them go unto them from the dead they will repent so if they see lazarus stand up and go to them they'll believe how many did jesus raise before luke 20. what happened in the ministry of jesus christ the lame walk blind see the the the crippled man that was healed in in church service and they murmured against that and they sought to kill him because of it how much more did god have to show them but they didn't believe the prophets because they weren't looking for a prophet they were looking for some other thing sorry i get passionate because i think some people might be missing i'm going to say it one more time they weren't looking for a prophet they were looking for some other thing their attention wasn't what was happening in that time in the midst the attention was a far off and as many as the prophets did and signs and wonders and prayer alliance and thus say of the lords and all that's happening through the ministry of brother branham the people that was even in the healing lines missed it turns around in the prayer line walks away and he goes lord let them not miss it have mercy he says brother so-and-so or mr so-and-so i'm calling you so god even gives him the name he calls the brother back so he would catch it and they're standing where these people walking and the the lame are raising up and people are worshiping and cancers are falling off and miracles are happening with these things happening here there's the event taking place and people miss it because they're not spiritually minded they don't think miracles and they don't think it's possible they just think what's this and god is wanting to call those people and he does the miracle and the miracle is not for healing like brother ben said they'll go sick again raising the dead he'll die again it's to get their attention and he said unto him if they not hear moses and the prophets neither will they persuade it though one rose from the dead hard words that's what he says i lost my place now this is the state of the the keep busy mortal one that's just dwelling and has has absolutely missed jesus in the present moment it is a real state it's happening today the reason i said it's not to scare you the reason i said is not to get you to fear the reason i'm trying to tell you that is i want you just to think if anything happens to you don't go straight into carnal realm because the carnal realm it is real bad because once you start going cardinal round then you start reasoning once you start reasoning then you form an opinion once you form an opinion you cut whatever you form the reasoning and opinion from anyone no matter what circumstance that you kill the influence on your life and people around your life so i know it's been preached over this pulpit many times but but carnal minded does not get you anywhere with god the scripture says to be spiritual minded is from god it's life to be carnally minded is is against god so so the whole thing now and this is where god showed me was because i was trying to get something from god in a natural realm i was trying brother q bean you said it just before the service praise the lord for our deacons seriously if i was looking for a thought i was looking for a sermon i was looking for something but god said i don't want you to think i don't want you to think i want you to just go do what i told you and whatever happens after that just let it let it let it do and that's what i'm doing so i'm trusting in the lord that this will give glory to him and not me so please don't look at me because that well you understand what i mean don't read between the lines okay now here it comes man luke 19 brother uh either can you put that up please verse one this is this morning sister robin put this up man look i didn't feel very well but after this i was buzzing they we call it stimulating hey i was i was actually so excited because this is the character that i had in my mind this is the character that i couldn't place why would i preach about pharisees carnality and all these things and how does zacchaeus all of a sudden come into this whole thing so yeah zacchaeus man i love it praise the lord and now i'm going to preach i'm going to close my book because i know i'm just going to say it as it is okay so there that goes i'll keep the bible open the word of god is always open so i said uh and jesus entered and paid passed through jericho this is now on the way before the pharisees rejected him in in luke 20. he's on his way there and he goes through jericho those walls brother ed were there again those walls fell again they build them up and they fall down and they build them up and they fall down they cannot keep god out of no place and behold there was a man named zacchaeus and he was the chief among the publicans and he was rich so remember the rich man went to hell i just said that that made me thought of that that lazarus the rich man had a choice and he still didn't make it and and jesus says he said man it's so hard for a rich man to get there not that if you have money you won't get it but there's so many things to worry about there's so many things to try and keep at bay and and next day in this day brother andy you've got you guys on more than one business how easy is it mate you got it from every side and you're trying to fend this and do this and do that and and you're so busy that you mostly operate in a carnal realm no i'm not saying it about brother andy but you and i've seen it you go a little bit into a spiritual realm and you try it again and somebody plucks you out of it and then you want to go a little bit back and say lord i want to think about and something plucks you out of it and you keep getting plucked out of that place where god wants you permanently to be hallelujah so now see it business mean business mean god don't want you carnal he don't want you carnal not even in your business i'm gonna say it as it is he don't want you to think like the world because you're not of the world no matter if you're a shrewd businessman no matter if you deal with unbelievers and sinners and whatever you cannot operate ever in a carnal realm in your business then it's not god's business because god is in the business of getting souls you're a businessman you do god's business he'll bring everything in but the moment you operate in the carnal realm you break your testimony god doesn't get the glory and you will reap what you sow that wasn't in the sermon either you cannot operate your business in the corner realm i've heard somebody say it one day and i said that's utter nonsense if it's god's business then god runs the business then you must be more spiritual minded than everyone because your business because it represents god's business is going to be under attack because it's already standing for the kingdom of god so your business will always be under attack it's never going to change until you're raptured so if you're going to run it then in a carnal mind you will always pay the penalty but if you can just be spiritual minded no matter like brother isaac said bring it on no matter what they bring god will make a way even if your backs against the wall god will still make a way but we operate in the supernatural thank you brother isaac for supernatural we operate in the supernatural we are not carnal kids at school cannot be carnal we are representation of the living god where your feet goes joshua goes god you are walking on this earth and every footstep must be spiritual i'm not saying be super spiritual don't get me wrong i'm saying if anything comes against you and they say something you must discern thinking men's filter where is this coming from what is it achieving and how is god going to get the glory because if god doesn't get the glory what am i doing here what am i missing and he sought to see jesus now see see zacchaeus had such a such a need to see miracles he had such a need to see jesus he he was desperate this man was a rich man he had everything but he knew at a stage there was something missing and he couldn't put his finger on it but he heard a commotion because they knew that that jesus was on his way and there with jesus when they said the people pushed up against him he was always people around him because miracles was happening so there was a great attraction and zacchaeus came and he tried to get over and see him and he's a man of short stature and it says here and he saw jesus who he was and he could not for the priest so that means a lot of people was preaching upon him there was a big crowd around him and in those days they weren't as pc as us to go can you do it to me to be distance they they that lady that touched him of his garment had to push through people to just to go touch and she got scared because she pushed people she wanted the blessing when she touched it he says who touched me she actually pulled back and whoa okay it got real you know because i just i just wanted to be healed and now it got real that everybody goes ah you know jesus everybody's touching you you know we're in the preseason but virtue left me someone came and touched me and then she come and she fell at his feet see it's me she was scared because something happened to jesus but she knew she wasn't the same she knew something changed so then he said to her you're healed your faith has healed you so now zacchaeus he's the same he's the same minded he sees jesus coming and there's something speaking to him saying man i need to see jesus but i don't need to just see jesus i want to see him in my life i want to get the fellowship with this man but now he's in the tree and he's a bit hiding because remember he did some dodgy deals in the past you know he's a businessman he he operated in the carnal realm okay he wasn't running his business as god's business he was running about i do this for you do that for me and you owe me and i do that and he was a carnal man and this is where zacchaeus stories get real real it just gets so beautiful so now he climbed up the tree and and he ran up and he climbed up into a sycamore tree just to see him for he was to pass that way and jesus came to that place and he looked up the smallest man on this earth now see how meek our god was how gentle how small he was he's the god of heaven deity walking on earth and he looks up at the shortest man that's around there say hey zacchaeus think about the humility he didn't say come down and now i talk to you he came to him where he was and he the lowest look up to him up there this is how he sees people he lifts them up he don't break them down he don't step on him he don't you don't push him down on people he lifts them up and when they up there then he talks to them no matter how the trial is if you think you far down in a trial guess what jesus is just under you lifting you up saying look up look up man there's only god that can be in two places he can lift you up and he can be above you know amen and then when he saw jesus come to that place he looked up and saw him and he said to him zacchaeus make haste and come down for this day for today i must abide at thy house so i had a i had a meeting with you i knew where were you going to be zacchaeus i knew exactly where you were and guess what i knew your name amen and he called him by name not by chance not if somebody here that wants to follow god or somebody here that he said zacchaeus so when i chose my side and i followed jesus jesus christ came to me and he said armand follow me armand salvation has come to your house we were in a prayer meeting at my house just in stokes valley brother ben and brother andy and we sat there and it's the first friday and i've seen it many times and i'll say it still because god is to be experienced god is to live in your life god is not a mental telepathy it's not a fire of thought it is an experience something that when it shakes you you want to tell everyone about it when it when it comes to your house you wanna you don't understand it sometimes you just go i have no idea what's going on here but when deity enters the house you know he's calling your name and we started praying and brother andy said okay armand you start praying because it's your house and i started praying and it was just a simple prayer because i didn't know what to pray i've never even prayed in my house on a friday night lord is my witness never ever had a prayer meeting in my house on a friday where i was calling to have fellowship with god instead of having fellowship with mammon okay so i'm just going to drink a bit of water so now andy ben prays and he prays now i pray again because i feel led to pray and all of a sudden the atmosphere changed someone enters the room and and it changes and i don't care what anybody felt there i don't care if nobody got it i got it it just dropped and he said armand follow me and i started crying and i really started praying and thinking and it went to ben and it went to andy and bronwyn and and everybody just started praying and we we had an awesome time because where we were at wasn't in this realm and and i'm going to close with zacchaeus at the end because i think it's very important it says he said made hasten come down and received him joyfully he received him joyfully and then forget about the pharisees we go down into verse 8 and zacchaeus stood and now he had his moment with jesus see the pharisees had their moment with jesus they missed it because they they were in that realm the spiritual the the religious realm there i know more this man wanted to see jesus and jesus called him by name and now he's standing before god almighty and he says to god i zacchaeus students said to the lord behold lord half of my goods i gave to the poor doesn't matter they can have it all they can have that off he says and if i have taken anything from any man by a false accusation now see he was a businessman in the carnal realm now he's going to change it and he's going to give his life to god so what does he do he says anything i've done wrong i will give them four times fault back because guess what your word is more important this meeting this seeing you in my life is more important than any money transaction there is on this earth anything that's right he says i will restore it to him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to your house for so much as you also is a son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek those to save which was lost so i'm asking we'll pray together um and i'll close the prayer but i want to ask you are we really seeking jesus are you really looking for him in your life or are you happy where you are are you content of battling out in your mind and reading the bible a little bit and then just go don't understand it no don't get that either yet no i'll get there one day as this is how we're seeking for god or are we actually getting desperate and then when jesus walks past and something's happening in the church we don't get distracted we don't start thinking of next week when i start thinking what i'm doing after the service but when a sister starts crying and the brother starts praying and the pastor's saying close your eyes and we're praying and the spirit of god is here though you can feel it or not that doesn't declare that god is not here we don't go by these senses but then when those things happen do you change from the carnal and come into the spiritual to say lord show me show me what's going on here what am i missing i'm desperate i want you to visit my house that sister is getting blessed that brother is saying praise the lord what about me what about me i will get into a tree i will stand on the store i will shout your name out to everyone i just want to see you i want you to come down and when people are worshiping you i want to have that i don't want to miss out because the only thing is the moment those things happen satan throws in a curveball to get someone distracted and they fall for it because they're calmly minded and they can't understand where somebody is shouting and joying and everything and brother martha one they were standing here they were praying for him i'll never forget it and he stood there and he said i'm free i'm free never forget it and that man walked away here and he had a moment with god and i said to god i want that not the emotion i want that i wanted to be able to come in front of you and say lord i want to see you and you go here i am here i am not just in your business not just in your life not even here i am and i have experience with my god where i know that i know that it tied me to a place in time where god said something to me in season that changed the way i walked that changed the way i acted that changed the way i thought that changed the way that i think about other people i want that moment children we don't have much time brothers young brothers there's not much time left if i could ever tell you something a word of advice and season take a step back not in your spiritual life just take a step back because when i was your age i was running but you know how i was running right yeah god god okay well i was running like that i had tunnel vision but because i had zeal and i had energy and i had drive and i had stamina and i was young and i was eager i still ran like this i never stopped and go i didn't do it i didn't do it i was chasing this one i was chasing that girl that was the next obstacle that's the new job that's this i want this car i want that that's that's me and i was good at it and as much as i did that satan just kept flicking it there you go there you go and then i'm here and then i'm there and everything's going good but my spiritual life went because i never stopped stopped and go hold on hold on hold on hold on there must be more here amen why is brother armand getting so excited why does brother andy when he comes to the pulpit give it all why didn't he go back into the world what can i do for you lord so that i can see you in my life i have no hopes ambitions dreams and plans are laid in your hands you're going to have to have that moment because if you want to be a zacchaeus zacchaeus realized that moment he didn't miss it for nothing amen can we have the musicians please brother andy maybe can you come and sing a couple of songs for us as well or maybe just sing one song that song that i said all of my ambitions hopes and plans i surrender them into your hands hallelujah and then we'll just pray together amen is it there you just throw that one up that's in the key of d do you know that one amen let's sing jesus all for jesus and it will end in the word of prayer and brother andy can can come and close the service say jesus all for jesus [Music] i am and have all i am i never want to be oh lord all i want to be like jesus christ all for jesus all i am
