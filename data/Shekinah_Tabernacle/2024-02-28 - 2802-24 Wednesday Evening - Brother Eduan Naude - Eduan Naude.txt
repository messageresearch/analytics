evening it's a Wednesday night and always excited um hopefully I'm the only one here nervous thank you musicians thank you so much for playing really nice songs um with my thought that I have the the songs really I think fit you you you might wonder how and I will now deliver that message of how um let's turn to our Bibles um ecclesiastics 4 from verse n a little bit small there on the projector forgive me Ecclesiastes uh 4 vers 9-2 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall uh the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he had not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken amen and quickly just turn to Genesis 2:18 if you don't want to turn there it is there on the slide and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meat for him you may have your seat seats God bless the reading of his word and um I just speak through me so my my thought tonight um I thought tonight is basically lonely or alone so they they uh the world out there us as Believers we use this um uh let's break it down let's go into the definition of of of lonely right lonely being without company cut off from others or solitary not frequent frequented by human beings so desolate right so it's now starting to paint a grim picture or an it's got a little bit of a negative connotation to him to itself sad from being alone or Lonesome and the example right at the bottom is he was feeling uh lonely without his wife and children I'm feeling very lonely without my my wife tonight please keep her in prayer she's not feeling well and um as she strengthen on alone is not that bad separated from others or isolated so we had desolate in the first one here we have isolated exclusive from anyone and anything else or only she alone knows what happened you know when you get come come to the kids you know you he it's very quiet very silent we have three Rowdy boys and it's all of a go all of a sudden silent you go something's up and you come around the corner and they pointing fingers who did what he only knows what happens it was not me was it we we don't know right considered without reference to any other the children alone would eat that much we know a few people that can eat much right so so looking at lonely it it paints a bit of a grim picture and a bit of a a negative connotation to it alone alone is I won to say positive but it paints a more positive picture and a more neutral picture where where we can where we can enjoy ourselves alone if I can put it that way I don't want to skip too much so um alone I'll I'll dive into alone very quickly now maybe I'll start this way in my life um I I think as a as an individual as Edan I've never ever felt lonely so I can put it out there on record um I've never been depressed um I've never had a Time lot of times where I was misunderstood still today that that's fine it's how I speak you know um what I think and and and how I do um act on and react but I was never lonely so I was never desolate I was never feeling no one can get to me I'm I'm I'm absolutely out and and there's no hope for me I can't get there so I'll put that now on record that it is hard for me um my personality and character to enter into someone's burden that I would say is lonely right but I was the only child for about almost 8 years and I grew up alone so alone don't have a problem with being alone um ask my wife I could be in my nothing box all alone within a big crowd and and I'm just I'm I'm content I'm happy so alone you know you you you start imagining things you can you I had a big imagination maybe I'm I'm I'm saying too much now I had imaginary friend right and he was my Opa he was my granddad right Opa Yanik okay and um because of my imagination I had to share that with someone don't know why am I saying this now so I'll pick up the phone and I'll phone someone in Cape Town random people and I will tell them all about aiki and our hunting days when we hun lions and and I'm so convinced and convincing they they are flabbergasted who's this 5-year-old talking to them on the phone convincing them of op Yanik a and that we went hunting and you know we killed lion so sometimes mom would come no that other story I just said where you know when it's very silent um you know there's something up so Mom would be in the house and you go anyone's talking but I don't know to whom because it's just me and him in the house she comes around the corner we had a little study and there was that old phones that you know you ring with the yeah and she would run there and just pick up and hello hello and it's someone else on the other side of the country and on the line so I never was um concerned that I am alone or you know that I would be alone I I I don't really struggle uh these days they would probably call it fomo I guess he fear of missing out I I I can be alone I I'm happy and what I actually wanted to share here back in 1999 um we we did service years this this is that that uh counseling here that me and Lundy um ly and I met on on on this um time of our life and back in 99 so and one of the things that they Lov to do and I was so excited about was they called it Solitude now solitary confinement is probably a very negative connotation you know from a prison point of view but this Solitude was it's you you can have a little Journal you can have your Bible and just you all alone and that would that would be 2 hours so they will you know they will test the waters and see how people do two hours and then go to 4 hours 6 hours and at one stage it was eight hours so basically almost a whole day and and that was in clor somewhere in Cape Town all alone I thrived I loved it so I was you know writing in my journal and I wrote some poems and and you know you would read your Bible so I adored that time alone but it's not alone if you see what I'm going here I'm with someone I'm with a being I'm never alone right so this is the picture I want to uh paint to you you are never ever when you are a Born Again child of God you will never be lonely and you will never ever be alone am please there the this is the message I want to get over this ppit tonight do not wherever you are do not if you go back home and you're the only believer if you are on the other side of the world and all your family that's Believers whatever the situation please go out here tonight knowing not thinking not having faith kn knowing you are never lonely and you are never ever alone in this journey yes you have fellow Believers around you here but there's one Hallelujah there's one right so with our with our Prophet early on in his life young age and me and brother Isaac we we quickly spoke about that he was never alone and he couldn't figure out why is he not alone so there was this wind or he would do something and there was this twirl and this you know he would he would acknowledge there was something out there close by that would never leave him alone so when he when he got a bit naughty and when he you know he wanted to um shoot some of his friends or some of the uh the school kids um he you know he wanted to drink um and smoke there was always this thing that got his attention this being there's something out there that makes me I have to accept I'm not alone anymore so lay down in his journey he accepted it and what a wonderful uh uh moment that would have been to acknowledge I'm not alone but know what is that know what is that that's causing it me to not be alone right and he had it before he was he was baptized right so from a young age and what I want to bring in here is that in his ministry I believe he he would have felt lonely so bring a little context we had a youth camp and brother Michael opened up a little bit of um personalities you know certain personalities and and how brother Brandon um had the um oh no melancholic melancholic yeah and um how how they that that type of um personality would would easily be um I guess misunderstood right and early in his or in his ministry he would feel lonely even amongst the crowds and congregation so he would flee to get away and be alone so while he's feeling lonely the negative he's fleeing away from the crowds to be alone alone with who alone with God so so he cannot feel lonely anymore and then he will fellowship with the Lord somewhere alone alone on a Mountaintop and he will get his refilling so when we talk about alone here in this context he's running away to his bridegroom he's running away to get refilled but he wants to be alone so our vessel needs to be alone and shut in with God and I'll get there and it's not that far-fetched to say that our lord Jesus felt lonely so I'm talking about the negative connotation so here brother brandom is referring to and now to him that's able to keep you uh keep you from falling and to do ex exceedingly abundantly more than we could think may his grace and being anoint our meeting and may our faith settle down and imagine seeing seeing a lonely Pilgrim rejected of men Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief accused of being a devil a mind reader spiritualist coming walking along misunderstood but he was God's own son so Jesus felt lonely right he came to save he came to do a good deed and he was so misunderstood he always walked among all these people so many people so many different walks of life but within all that he would be able to feel lonely and alone he had to get he had to go and have fellowship with God talk to him alone talk to him where that Veil that drops behind him the prophet once told about the story uh I think when he went on honeymoon with brother uh brother with sister MAA and they had a little baby and uh it was a honeymoon so he I think he sneakily arranged a little hunting trip and um he went into the woods he left the uh left sister maida and the baby at the little um lean on I think they called it and and he's away and storm sets in and quite a devastating storm quite a destructive storm where they say it sort of you can't see almost your hand in front of your face you know you can't see what's happening in in you know two steps in front of you and as as he's explaining the story The Lord's also dealing with him and working with him and how he's walking now this walk and he's trying to go there and he gets lost and he he gets back to where the he shot a deer and he gets back to the deer and then he walks this way and he get he's all he's all clueless right but in that he's still talking to himself he's saying oh I should go there I should know I should know I'm a huntsman I'm a Woodsman I know I should know I should go this way so just keep the the the wind to my back or into my face and I'll walk this way I I I know and at one point where he confessed and he said I'm lost yeah now while that was happening the Lord's just saying I'm your strength and I'm your Refuge I'm your strength and I'm your refuge and I'm he's hearing that but he thinks he's he's he's becoming mad this coldness and you know it's freezing temperature Subzero it's sitting in maybe on him you know so he's starting to uh hallucinate he's starting to think weird things but the Lord's just saying I'm your strength and I'm your Refuge so during all that I believe he did not feel once lonely or alone so he knew that the Lord with W was with him the the Lord was just patient to sit there and say when can I have a turn I'm your strength and I'm your Refuge have a lord do you want to be alone with me you know he was just so patient so mindful the Lord and then how how he went to the Lord and said Not For my sake so selfless but for MAA for the little one can I get to them can I get to them in time because they knew sister MAA was probably not the a huntsman and a Woodsman like he was so she would have stressed out a little bit especially with a baby now that story I just want to bring into context here and and uh and that's the next slide yes yes that's the way you go to Calvary so he's talking about um he's walking now and he said if you can just get to that telephone wire that wire that runs from the um from the the Reserve um what do you call them uh guide a house or something Hut down six or seven miles to where this leaning his or lean over us and um said if you can just get to that wire so now he's walking he's walking with his hands up just imagine it's all foggy it you cannot see your hand in front of you is walking up it's getting freezing he's putting his gun down and then the other hand okay get up then start walking just feeling his way feeling his way Lord just help me if I get to that wire and know I can make it no I can make it now he's all of a sudden feeling that wire it bumps into that wire so here's now the story now I'm picking up that's the way you go to Calvary with both hands up hollering for mercy God directs you you don't know how I felt when my hand hit something I pulled on it and it was the wire I knew I could hold to that wire it would lead me to my loved ones What a Feeling to it was to know that God had helped me it was a relief I knew I would save them but it was nothing like the thrill it was one night when I held up my hands in the air until something else touched me my hand and my heart it was a wire of the holy spirit that tells me that the end of this road my loved ones and savior is awaiting as I thought on my ways I wasn't a hunter I wasn't a Woodsman God was my refuge and my strength and that is what he is he is our refuge when that Veil drops behind you and you are shut in with God you can never be alone but you are alone you are alone with this this being that's just living and we were just praying in the in um at home and I said that keep the atmosphere Lord because if if if you are welcome here death sickness the world out there everything has to flee he's light he's life and when that's there healing can come restoration can come um next one here and as I've been referring to the um the veil that drops be behind you this was so impactful for me and this is the um sermon we we reading for this week thank you brother kben for putting up and keeping that on that's beautiful that we can have this abundance of Rich word that can just rush over us like like fresh water and mana and a man that once walks into God so he's walking into that holy of holies long gone are we now in the outer Court we are now walking into and not where that Mana can get stale in that inner Veil but we in that inner court but we walking into the holy of holies that's why that Veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of God eating the Mana no wonder 12:00 9:00 late or anything he's living in the presence of the king amen no wonder every day is fine for him every day is fine for you oh I don't know where the next paycheck is coming from oh I don't know how I'm going to feed these kids and get them through school oh I don't know what am I going to do with my dad or my mom or whoever that's in sickness 12,000 kilm away I don't have to care he cares and as long as and I'll take it here he knows where he is at he has found the secret place from our Sermon Just on Sunday he has went behind the veil the doors is closed behind him he don't see nothing of the world oh the beautiful place to be in hallelujah amen so let's just I want to catch up here bright so what do we have next there we go okay so something practical that ladies and gentlemen is my heart okay and um there's something shiny on there so let's see Malachi can you come and help me please and Analise maybe you can hopefully you can reach out oh there's a chair praise the Lord okay

you you're going to say yes Lord and we're going to have Fellowship together we're going to enjoy each other's company and that ladies and gentlemen can never be removed from this vessel's heart amen I can never be alone and when I look back in my life now when I was five when I was eight when I was 12 I was doing silly things but I was never alone Looking Back Now I can see how mindful the Lord was and to take me a vessel 12,000 km away to be able to stand here and say I believe the revealed word nothing is a mystery everything is open oh what a wonderful amen thing to to to to to have now while we while we here and I thought I want to bring this in a Stony heart a Stony heart brother Michael also on the on the um Youth Camp said he there's this phases in your life when when we become renewed vessels um and first we have a Stony heart I had a Stony heart the Lord had to replace that with a new heart so I had to do that first before he sends the Holy Ghost and that's why the order is there repent be baptized and then you will receive the promise of the Holy Ghost so we had to have this and everything is in place everything is in order everything is perfect take that Stony heart put something that's living and breathing and can have space and room for the for the for the Lord to live in yeah and when that's ready when that new heart is there he will come in so then he gives his his spirit so I wanted to that's a little plug that there it's a beautiful message please go and look at it it is online a Stony heart then a new heart but only after that the Lord will bring his spirit and and come living here and I think there was a old commercial back in the day I think it was KitKat that all resistance crumble or was it flake was it flake was it ero okay one of the chocolates you know you look at it then it crumbles you know one of those I think it's a flake and this is where I want to sort of give you hope when you surrender Taz was talking about this as well when you surrender all loneliness crumble right you cannot be alone anymore More You are not alone you cannot be lonely anymore you cannot go into that state where oh everything uh uh you know no one's understanding me or how do I I'm alone in this I don't think everyone is going anyone is going through what I'm going through inside of me it's not true because you are not lonely you are not alone anymore I want to read you this and I don't have it on the on the slides and that's when you surrender I was talking about the heart there so let's put up the heart again the heart the heart is the Abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwell in his glory over the ark and the heart is the ark God dwells not in the head he in the heart God is not known by theology God is is not known by mental conception God is known by an oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again experience that's in the human heart yet men and women live a good life and love love God by mental conception we do see it around us but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with Christ see now I'm hid alone with Christ and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temper temperament he is uh he is living his own life to his own will through you Hallelujah no that sounds awful but it's right Christ so so we are healed it we are surrendered you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he would speak he think the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you you are healed it and resting yeah relax rest when Christ speaks through the lips and think through the Mind see through the eye acts through the temperament Hallelujah then the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time God or Christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's Christ in you you say well you see you say I believe that to be the truth brother brandham that's all right it's in here he's talking about in here but has it come sorry in here has it come in here if it is then your whole makeup is Christ your attitude your desires your appetite your everything is Christ healed it resting everything perfect no um no matter how dull it looks or how black it looks still it's the same Christ in you amen he speaks to The Sinner in the voice that he would speak to him in he speaks to the prostitute in the voice that he would speak to them in he thinks through your mind the very thoughts that he speaks through your heart the very way that he would uh he would if he was here on Earth and you are no more your own but you surrendered and as a surrendered vessel you don't have to be lonely ever again amen that's right you can enjoy Christ presence daily how many times do you think you will walking through this Cesspool but where people kids and I'm talking to you as well you're going to school and they go what does he have what does she have yes she maybe looks different she's wearing something else that we won't wear but there's something to her there's something about him what is that yeah that's you not being alone that's you that's opened up your heart and said Lord come in take over and do what you want now we walking we happy we're free we we've got Liberty we've got joy unspeakable full of Glory we just carrying on but look at the bombs look at the social media look at this look at that we're working because I'm not alone I don't have to care anymore here's my rest I hope that little thought just brings something to you in remembrance to say remember there's nothing new You are not alone you will never be alone amen and and it's so wonderful hopefully you can take this thought tonight with you now when we go into prayer and we pray to the one that came down and said I don't want you to be alone anymore I want to come spend time with you and fellowship with you it was so interesting maybe I can just skip to that first um I think it was this one um Genesis 3:8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day so he was looking I I want to Fellowship have youever ever wondered where is he walking from and they talking about the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden the voice of the Lord God maybe a sermon for another day but even him he was he was this is now after he's created Adam he's created Eve he said it's not good that he needs to be he has to be alone he creates Eve and he wants to come and see how's it going how's it going see the positive we know what happens you know after that but but he was wanting to Fellowship he was creating something to not be alone anymore amen he's never alone he's omnicient and he's om presentes but he had a vessel that he wanted to to spend time with amen let's bow our heads as the musicians maybe come forward and then I can um I can take your your prayer request there's a few prayer requests online uh on our church notice board already can we sing um can we sing this song I don't want to start it in the wrong key I am not alone is that how it goes alone I am not alone you will go before me you will never leave me I am not alone I am not
