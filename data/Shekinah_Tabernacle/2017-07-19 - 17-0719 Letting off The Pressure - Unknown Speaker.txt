here Oh may God bless you welcome Amen if you've got your Bibles handy we just go straight to the scripture we'll go to proverbs 18 in verse 10 and then we're gonna read from Luke chapter 30 Luke 21 verses 34 and 35 so proverbs 18 and verse 10 I'm sure it's a familiar scripture to us all but I'm glad I mean it sees the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run earth into it and is safe amen hallelujah amen then we're going to look chapter 21 verses 34 and 35 hallelujah that means this is Jesus speaking of thee well let's read from verse 29 showing it says and he spake to them a parable as Jesus speaking he says behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see and know that your ownselves at summers night hands so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know you that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I say to you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that they come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth Watchi therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that you shall that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man a man made Lord this is word you may have your seats tonight in his presence I'd like to if I could take a little thought up in I been thinking of I've been listening to the messages that brother branham he he preached a few sermons entitled letting off the pressure and we understand from this day and age that we live in I'm basically just going to I'm going to preach letting off the pressure tonight you know we it's incredible where where you look at the age that we are that we live in time has filled up you know none of us really have a spare moment you know we are rushing from from the morning to the evening you know our our our timescale of things and our you know our what do you call it you know our day especially boiled down to minutes and seconds instead of hours and you know we're going to how to do this out it's a minute here a minute there and you know we wake up and you know we are we are straight away many people they check their cell phone and they aren't semesters the answer emails before they even get out of bed and then they've got a rush and have breakfast and maybe they'll take a coffee in the and the car on the way to work and they're listening to something maybe in the car on their China you know snatch a few minutes maybe with the Lord as they're driving then they're at work and then there are work mode and then they're you know and then they're you know they're trying to do things that they should have done last week and they're running running running running it's a pressurized age right and then you've got the you know and then you've got your bills to pay you've got you know you've got to call the bank to organize this and you got to get this insurance and you've got a you know there's all these things and then you know maybe your phone has died you got to call the insurance company and then you know you got all these things you've got to organize and sort out you know it's not just simple as wake up in the morning here's the day there's many things that you need to do that's because this age is a pressure age I mean we've never lived the the world has never been in such a pressure I believe from from Adam and Eve till till now where there is such the busyness of life as everywhere you know children even growing up they can go they can have your sport or music before school than their school than they have some activity after school dinner at home they're going to do their homework then they've got to go to bed then Saturday they're at sport and they do something in the Saturday afternoon and then there's Sunday maybe church is telling us in this Monday and it rolls around you know it's pressurized busyness amen and it's meant to be this way unfortunately but fortunately for us we have a a strong tower that we can run into and are safe amen as we read there in Proverbs the you're the name of the Lord is a strong tower where the righteous run into and they are safe Alleluia so now we so there is a place of safety in this age now I know this may be all very familiar but we sang this morning tonight you know renew the joy of thy salvation so it's good yeah it's good every so often just to just to really maybe go to 101 and just rejoice and the fact of what God has done for us because pressure will try and take your joy away pressure tries to make you lose sight of the goal of our body change you know pressure tries to take away the fact that we're more than overcome as in Christ because pressure makes you look at natural things it makes you look at things you might have got to do here but when it's all said and done they won't be remembered I mean when it's all said and done we once out wish I did that a bit more I wish I you know it'll all be forgotten we'll be around as throne will be praising him for a salvation we'll be giving him glory hallelujah we'll be thanking him amen and the pressure will really be off then but we have a place of safety we have a place of refuge in this day where we can run into and dwell hallelujah where we're not only we just go in to once in a while but we dwell in that place I mean let's go to Joshua chapter 20 Alleluia if you're feeling pressure let it off tonight amen this is we're just going to read the first six verses of Joshua chapter 20 but you can read the whole foot amen we under all this just read it here so Joshua 20 verse 1 down to verse 6 and it says the Lord also spake unto Joshua saying speak to the children of Israel saying appoint for you cities of refuge wherein I spake unto you by the hand of Moses that the slay that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly and unwittingly may flee phizzer further and they shall be your refuge further from the Avenger of blood and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the sir take him into the city unto them and he shall and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the Avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the Slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor and unwittingly and hated him not before time and he shoved well in that city until he shall stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the Slayer return and come unto his own City and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled so here we have Joshua we know Joshua the minister of Joshua places the people in the promised land it's a it's a ministry of adoption or placing and in the land there is actually six cities of refuge and we understand through the scripture that air is the seventh is always a mystery I mean for there was you know so there was so the seventh is always a mystery so Jesus when he was you know filling me you know when he turned the water into wine there were six pots of water for purification and he was the source of the purification he was the seventh the woman at the well head had six husbands but her real husband was the seventh standing in front of her amen because he is the rear you know he's the mystery and then so the seventh city of refuge is Christ amen it is not a geographical location but it is a it is a being it's a supernatural God I mean where you can enter into rest entering into Christ and it's a very simple process to repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I mean you shall enter into the city of refuge you shall run into the strong tower I'm in the high tower so the seventh as Christ himself so now we read here that if someone unwittingly did it they may flee thither so they had a writer fight actually he killed someone saying accidentally happened where they knew that the relations of those person going to come and kill him they could run into one of these cities and once they got into the city they were safe and then they could really let off the pressure and makers imagine that your life was in jeopardy and the Old Testament knows eye for eye tooth for tooth amen your there was no mercy I mean so so imagine the pressure your life was in danger you've got a run and you don't know you know maybe maybe there's a few cities you could go to maybe there's one yo you know there's hip runs over here or you know there's a few which one should I go to and then you make your fast as you can you run that's the same thing in this day you know there comes an awareness you're lost and undone amen you have a sin burden and then you know that the you know the hounds of hell are chasing you I mean that's God's conviction and you're going to recognize I'm going to run I got to find a place to lay off the pressure holy and then you recognize now Christ as that city of refuge and then you run to him you've got to give your life to Him I mean you can't just be raised up at a Christian home you've got to surrender your all hallelujah but then when you really get into him and you know your sin has been done away with you know he he took care of the sundeck hallelujah Amen you you know you know it's gone who knows your sins are gone then you can really live off the pressure hallelujah because once you know that's been sorted out it doesn't matter what happens in life I mean you can have it all you can have nothing it doesn't matter if you're in the city of refuge glory to God hallelujah if you're just a bum on the street with nothing hallelujah Amen if you're a millionaire praise the Lord it doesn't matter hallelujah Amen so now it's a glorious thing we can because this life makes us forget about what really we have I mean if you're a believer this night Amen if you're sealed into the kingdom buyers Holy Spirit you have the most precious thing and you can lead off the pressure you know why worry about tomorrow he's got tomorrow why not worry don't worry about next week he's got next week if he had last week he left this week I mean if he had last year if this year if he's guarded you down here he'll God the rest of the way we don't need to worry about anything we can lid off the pressure hallelujah when my enemies come against me when the yeah when the flood when the enemy comes in like a flood I'll raise up a standard I can lid off the pressure I'm in the battles the Lord's I can let off the pressure parley he's the captain of the hosts leading this battle I'll let off the pressure mentioned Joshua he would have had a real burden he's he's raised up in the ministry of moses he was there in egypt seeing the plagues fall he was there on the Passover night hallelujah he can lead off the pressure I mean all the firstborn sons could lead off the pressure that night I'm in the head of screaming in the Egyptians your brother Brown Joan does it your firstborn son goes daddy the head Johnny just died I used to play them now he's dead I hear screaming down the street and then and then the son I mean ending the father your brother says you know just takes off the spectacles puts down his Bible don't race and you can lid off the pressure how do you know what do you mean Danny what do you mean he died I might die just look out the window see the blood on the door and lentil you can lid off the pressure how do we know it's going to work because did you see what happens there Moses with the plagues then he said do this you'll be safe that this angels going to come if that's true this is true you can let off the pressure and little you know whatever his name is little Eli I could just live off the pressure hallelujah but now here's Joshua think of it as a burden God God moves in a powerful way and the Ministry of Moses they never saw things like this they never saw the Red Sea part they were slaves for hundred years are slaves then God seems to deliver it out 80 year-old man with a stick let my people go oh my a few you know there in Goshen it's light in Goshen it's dark over Egypt they never saw things like this I mean and Joshua was there and he saw God come down on Mount Sinai and the Lord given and you know yeah he saw the tabernacle be built in the glory of the Lord filling the tabernacle and you know he saw incredible things but now the burden came to him you got to take the people over you have to place the people in the land Moses we don't mention the mention passing that burden on to the you say the next generation you've got to finish this work I mean the ministry is not done we've been taken out be eager to take them in I can't take them in hallelujah because I said because I smoked the rock I'm a DA you know I can't go in you got to do it they would have built up some pressure now now there's a burden now there's a burden you know he would have had Joshua would have had a burden amen but then and then they and then they crossed thee you know then they and they cross the Jordan now he would have had confidence because God said as I was with Moses I'll be with you but he still had a would have been still a a pressure because he had to finish his job they couldn't just that they couldn't just cross Jordan they had to go all the way they had to be placed in the land here defendant for Fuller's ministry hallelujah and thence in the Harriers he you know any and he gets up one morning he looks at Jericho now he knows in his mind do we have siege equipment no we have battering rams know there are siege towers no do you have catapults no do you have anything that can break these walls no what am I going to do then he's there he sees a man with a sword drawn but the pressure is about to come off here he sees the captain he says you for us or against us and God says I'm not for you against you I've come to take over this battle I come as the kept of the hosts of law amen so I'm not on your side you're on my side I mean that would lay off a lot of pressure I mean when he would have recognized god you're here I mean you've come as the cap to the Xhosa law and you're the general of this battle hallelujah and it's the same thing with us friends individually or as families who's who's in charge of this battle are you in charge of the battle you're not in charge of the battle if you take it upon yourself a built pressure I mean but then if you know he's in charge it takes off a lot of pressure and you can let off the pressure hallelujah because if you know God is in control Amen just stay following him stay following him and he'll see you through hallelujah and that lets off pressure member because there is a pressure now because now we know there's a rapture and this go to 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 we know there's a rapture you know we know there's a Bride of Christ are you on that number amen and there's such a battle there's such a battle of muster I've heard it up your the last few weeks from a few people but am i worthy I'll tell you he makes you worthy and we read about the righteous run into the strong tower and a safe well well do I fit in that category because that's the big battle amen and I have that banner we all have that battle a my righteous am I do I actually warrant getting into the lid off the pressure I say yes yes by the authority of this I say yes by the message there I say yes hallelujah now as we're turning to first Thessalonians chapter 4 we read there and Luke 21 and I'll just read it quickly just - he says now and the cares of this life so that that day come upon you unawares it's verse 34 of Luke 21 sits a warning pleased to come upon you I know it is but we have to understand and I trust we do understand if I can find this alone Ian's there Paul makes a promise to this age I'm glad we have a way of escape does that that should cause us to lid off the pressure I mean where God has opened the door come up hither hallelujah you know revelations four and one is after the last Church age where a door is open in heaven and John as a symbol of the bride has called up amen and we are trusting and say I'm John in the book of Revelation can you say you've got to be able to identify that's me he's talking about me I'm gonna fall fool what he what he wasn't prophecy I'm gonna fulfill hallelujah you gotta claim it name it and claim it that's just not some you know that's actually a scriptural thing your Caleb said give me this mountain this one that one there give it to me I want it he named didn't he claimed it you have to it's like it yo this is this is a will is it not this is a will and it sees to so-and-so is is this and if you're so so you're gonna say I want what's in the will give it to me by the authority of the lawyer it's mine amen now sorry I just lost my page first Thessalonians 4 now I love it we know we read we read the Bible many times and we think that chapter and verse is a change of thought many times but when Paul wrote the wrote the most well all of the Bible did not have chapter and verse it was just written okay so now we read here first Thessalonians 4 and we'll just read from from verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep so there has to be a people which are alive physically alive and remaining and remaining is to remain in the truth in the faith of the father's and this Ministry of Malachi 4 has restored us to the faith of the fathers so we are remaining yes amen that's it that should make us very happy I am Alive and I remain amen to the chemical shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we know that the shout is the message brother Graham says in the rapture message the message is the shower I mean so so he's not making you guess at it or think maybe he says the message is the shower holy so we're living in the scripture we've heard the shout I mean I'm sure you've heard that shot something in your soul said this is not this man speaking this as God has spoken hallelujah amen I'd say that should cause us the lid off the pressure then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so well so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words now many times we think that's the end but but chapter 5 verse 1 notice the first word of but which is a conjunction which binds what you've just read to what you're about to read but at the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that are write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that that day that the day of the Lord so cometh as a for the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren and not in darkness who's not in darkness this should let off the pressure you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief yeah all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for the home at the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us now say for God has not appointed me God has not appointed me to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us whether we should wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort ye comfort yourselves together and edify one another even also ye do hallelujah say saying you're not in darkness this day will not overtake you as a thief it's not going to come and go and you miss it but your children of the light hallelujah and never as a day is the lights on so bright as this day this glorious take that's more than a song I mean when brother Graham was standing and he'd preach a message Shalom God's peace be upon you holy and he speak about the light shining I meant how the word the word when it's manifested has made light and you go from now you go from Calvary when Jesus has lost you your days on earth multitude of Scripture was fulfilled the light was shining even in his last few minor moments a lot of prophecy was fulfilled and then there was a long period of a better fulfillment but a lot of tip a lot of waiting wasn't so bright and then God sends Elijah upon the earth and a multitude of scripture has been fulfilled in this day what's happening light is shone hallelujah so we're not children of darkness this should cause us to lid off the pressure I'm just going to list a whole bunch of things that they are caused us to lead off the pressure that means because what there are things that what's with him the good and honest think on these things hallelujah glory to God so now he says though and Luke chapter 21 we we read there he says watch your so verse verse 36 we read this in her opening Scripture but now here comes the challenge I said we because there's the battle where we think we're unworthy okay but the scripture tells us very plainly he has made us worthy okay so I'm just going to hopefully knock knock a leg out of this one because it's what we because if we don't have confidence with God we feel that we are unworthy to lay hold upon the promise if we feel we are unworthy then we feel we can't take hold of the promise because Who am I and then you could really say well Who am either the King of glory would die for amen so sees here now what she therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man so now so a challenge comes on and maybe you never realize this performance subconsciously as human beings we we look at ourselves and say but we're fallen as human beings you know we're unworthy to take the promise and many times we can look back and see what God has done for us that he's raised us up together I mean that we sit in heavenly places we've crossed the Jordan I mean we've you know we've come out of the world we've come through a wilderness with no we've been justified and sanctified the Jordan is a death itself we laid it all on the altar and now we're into the promised land amen do we not who's been there Amen but then now the challenges now but you've got to take the whole end and then now this is now now it comes to the pot oh now now how am I I'm unworthy to take it yeah I'm unworthy to take it now you've got to lay that aside because you've got to understand see see and you're in former ages it was always the works and the blood they separate until you go read the Philadelphia interchange like your Weasley bored out you know it was so it's your works and the blood of two separate things but brother Graham says in this in this age when this has come open a new book as count yes become a new book that's not your works and the blood it's all the blood I mean but your works are out of love what he did for you and if you're motivated by love it's not works hallelujah so now if it is all the blood now then we can rest in the assurance if he has washed us Amen if we are sinless you got a look what does he made me now this should let off the pressure I mean because where it says to have boldness because that you had to come before a throne of mercy and grace but then we say well am I where did it come before a throne absolutely Amen you know so we have the right he makes us by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified it says the book of Hebrews by one offering not one every year not every Easter time or Sabbath or whatever it is by white offering he has perfected me hallelujah so now we can rest that is true it's true amen and then when God member we are called by him because where we were predestinated by him remember when he hung when he hung on Calvary he wasn't thinking I'll make some people maybe feel sorry for me and they'll give their lives to me and they'll serve me no Sarah I mean he knew he knew who was going to serve him he knew down through 7 Church ages he knew you'd be here glory to God I mean he knew you'd be here he knew that when your word his word came across your path Amen you'd give it give your life it may have been struggles who cares about the struggles what are you now instead of what you were hallelujah so now he knew in his mind before the foundation of world he thought of you amen and his thoughts towards you are a peace there good thoughts hallelujah I mean so if he thought of you as being redeemed maintenance image hallelujah washed in his blood sinless perfect I mean he became sin that we'd become his righteousness this should lead off the pressure I mean because of he met you once why does he seal you into the kingdom he claims you he says this is my property seyton they don't belong to you they never belong to you I mean they just have to recognize they're my children hallelujah so now we are having sailed into the kingdom he's put a brand upon you hallelujah he sealed you and saying this is mine I mean good luck trying to take take his things away from him I wouldn't try and take try and take anything from him well I want anyone to a try hallelujah sly brother brems says about you you're an eagle takes his little eaglets you know from the nest flies down to the meadows you know they jump off they have a little Pentecostal revival there she flies up and looks over there and and then he says therefore coyote comes after one of those you're one of those eaglets that eagle mama Eagle flogged him to death and he says woe unto you your Satan comes against one of God's children he's got Jesus Christ on his hands I mean you got to remember that the enemies ask you howler he's got Jesus Christ on his hands and no one you know my daddy is bigger than anyone elses daddy hallelujah my daddy's way bigger than all the daddies in the world hallelujah my daddy you beat up all the daddies amen bet you'd lead off the pressure hallelujah so we're children of the light amen glory to God now so that we would be counted worthy now let's go to I want to go to revelations chapter 19 because everything you just think now here we are we here we are in this age and of God remember God doesn't enforce something upon you without giving you the ability to do it amen he never says God go God become my bride without preparing anything I mean he's already got everything sorted out hallelujah just like Abraham when he said Eliezer to go get Rebekah all the all the welfare Abraham was when on those camels he said the servant the trusted servant everything was prepared I mean Sarah's ten was still there hallelujah for the Union wind when Rebecca comes back amen everything was prepared hallelujah and now it's the same in this age because he's calling a bride he's called the bride through all the other ages but this one's gonna be in his full image I meant we're going to grow to the fullest of the statue of Christ he promised it hallelujah so now if that's the case he must prepare us amen so revelations 19 and verse 1 let's just read this whole thing because I love it house is a lujah cuz that's us after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteousness are his judgments for he has judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication at it and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said I'll lujah and her smoke rose up for ever and ever so when the enemies cast into the lake of fire coming hallelujah hallelujah I'm one of those who's going to say then and foreign 20 elders are we going to be glad you thinking about the world you know you know that you're the enemies washed away you know the whole thing's cleaned off and he can't come back Alleluia I mean there's gonna be a new heavens and new earth hallelujah I mean we're gonna place in the New Jerusalem hallelujah I mean we're gonna live eternity it's gonna roll on and on and on hallelujah we're never gonna have a bad day hallelujah hallelujah doesn't that get you the lid off the pressure glory to God amen and four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down to worship God who sat on the throne saying amen Alleluia and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye servants and ye that fear and both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth now we know that voice of many waters I mean s people's multitudes nations and tongues I mean so our voice is part of that saying Alleluia for the Lord our God omnipotent reigneth hallelujah no we should start saying that now Alleluia amen amen saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth so he reigns over your search stances he's in charge he's the boss amen he's high above everything hallelujah and he's not some manager that just sits on his desk in his office and has no idea he knows what's going on hallelujah his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me Alleluia let us be glad and rejoice see been glad and rejoicing makes you lead off pressure Amen for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready now we know the union is now a man we go to the wedding supper but the union is now a means this is being looked out and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God hallelujah and it was granted to her it's been granted to you hallelujah this should this should help you lid off the pressure it's been granted to you it's a wedding garment it's been it's been made to fit you perfectly this word has been made to fit you you maybe had to get cut and change the mold but you would foot it eventually hallelujah and now you felt it hallelujah amen to all these things already amen it says blessed are they that are call into the marriage supper of the lamb so who's blessed tonight Amen that should make you let off some pressure but what about all this stuff going on down here don't worry about it too much remember unresolved things build up pressure I mean so resolve things whatever you do Alleluia but we're here to let off the pressure Amen so it was granted now sorry you say well it's granted to this woman to be made the you know his wife has made herself ready you say well how does that happen down upon the earth because I don't see no no bridal gown that I'm wearing right now naturally you don't see me in a white dress not saying it to be silly but you know you say that's pretty obvious but they but the fine linen clean and white the rushes of the Saints now that is if we are dressed in him amen if we have entered into that rest if you received the Holy Ghost you are arrayed in fine linen clean and what and remember a wife in the scripture is very different to a girlfriend or a fiancee I mean because now our wife is the only one legally that can be the child amen so so a girlfriend a fiance they can have some nice gifts but they can't legally have bring forth the life you follow me but a wife can actually it's more than picking up a nice piece of jewelry they can pick up a baby and say who does it look like looks like him looks like my husband amen it's the same thing with us now there's a life in us Alleluia we're bearing an image I mean we're producing a life hallelujah and it looks like him hallelujah he followed me that's what's so different between ER between a flirt or fiance or a girlfriend and someone who's been United Amen it produces a life hallelujah and that's why it's so glorious you just let him live once in a while let him live all the time and you see your life begins to move in a very different kind of direction hallelujah hey man that's glorious that should cause you to live off the pressure Amen when you look in the you know when you look in the mirror who do you see you know time what is time it's kind of hebrews chapter 2 you know time is running out for a lot of things and that's a good thing when it's time shall be no more I'll say glory hallelujah hallelujah amen now time time is here because of sin we know that eternity plus N equals time I'll put it that way so if you take away sin it goes back there's no more time but now we are manifested in this time in this little hickey of time for for two purposes one is that God with all his attributes of being a redeemer and a kinsman and a husband and a healer and a guide and a redeemer and a comfort and a advocate and everything that he is would be expressed to you I mean so the devil actually did your favor when he when he caused the fall to happen because God couldn't reveal the fullness of himself to Adam and Eve if they're in a perfect state so God allowed the fall to happen that he could fully reveal that's why it's actually such a glorious thing I'm sick you should say hallelujah God you can show yourself as a healer to me amen Lord I'm losing my way hallelujah you can trim me as a guide hallelujah amen I feel very stressed and worried glory you can show me as a company you can show yourself as a comforter to me Amen you say well let the earth that's why count it all joy when you try by fiery trials and all these things you say thank you Lord because you're going to reveal yourself to me in this in some way hallelujah take the three Hebrew children they didn't see the fourth man outside they didn't see the fourth band before the decree went forth you know that everyone had to worship the image they didn't see the fourth man when they're standing there before the king saying we will not bow to your image if we die we die if we live we live they didn't sit but in the midst of the trial when they're in the furnace that's when they saw the fourth man and you got to think about it now would they trade that for the world no sir hallelujah because that member the fire all the fire did was loose their beds that's all the trial did was loose they're banned see how the lujah and it's the same thing with us all trials are good just say praise God I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow hallelujah Amen things are going sideways you're the shepherd hallelujah if he tried to guide any sheep without yo I remember my brother and I we were we were about you guys aged over there on my uncle's cattle farm I mean sheep sheep and deer station and the back road from Wilder gisbert where nowhere a quad bike 500 sheep take them down this road into this paddock it's not that it's just a road it's not that easy you gotta go up here chase them down this bank and go here and did it you know you gotta guide them and a Shepherd you know sheep we've all gone astray we've all gone astray the scripture says amen so the ship it has to go find the Sheep Amen this way he say just rejoice you say well I'm going but things are going sideways Lord you're my shepherd Here I am that's not crazy I don't think Amen now Hebrews do time so time the first thing that time was manifested for was to reveal himself to you the second thing was he would destroy the devil I mean that's why time is here now let's read here I love to Hebrews 2 but we'll just read this is read from verse 9 and then we'll go down to verse 15 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to be made the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he has not ashamed to call them brethren call you brethren Alleluia saying I will declare thy name and to my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I'll put my trust in him and again behold I and the children with God has given me for as much sin as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage I mean so he took on the form here to come unto time to redeem you and to destroy his enemy Amy that's why this time and that's why timers you know that's why it sees in Revelation chapter 12 then you know the devil has been cast out upon the earth you know well let's just read that through this got a let's go to Revelation chapter 12 you don't mind reading do you hallelujah Amen now let's read from verse I just this is read from verse 12 of Revelation 7 and we're going to go down to verse 4 so revelations 12 verse 7 we're going to go from 7 to 12 I'm glad because the devil wherever is he loses early let's read and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven that should lead off the pressure because if he lost there he's gonna lose here and because the same God that defeated my fear has come down down to human flesh to defeat him here hallelujah that should make us lid off the pressure and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power was Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him now who's this here we come on the scene interstage left right of Christ you this is your cue and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them amen we live in him where I lifted up the heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're not word to the inhabitants of the earth to the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time Alleluia we get stressed about not having enough time think about this guy think about this guy he's got a lot of pressure he can't let it off he can't let off his pressure this pressure just builds day by day they by day you know he seizes rolls back as a nation he can't get rid of them he can't stop them he tried you go read about the wars against Israel it's you know the odds are crazy get there they're and they're flourishing it's not just a little fig tree that puts forth as bugs as a strong tree a strong nation he couldn't stop them coming he tried to wipe them out in Europe and everything now they're a nation he can't wipe out God's natural seat how much more his spiritual seat hallelujah amen the the bride from every nation if he can't wipe them out he can wipe you out hallelujah he couldn't stop the truth coming down through the dark ages amen he tried he had the whole power head Europe under his total control amen yo you know they're from the Vatican they turn kingdoms how they would hallelujah he can stop the truth coming down I mean he couldn't stop at the end he couldn't stop the truth that euro and China he couldn't stop the truth he couldn't stop it in Russia I mean he couldn't stop it behind the Iron Curtain they were believers of this message behind the Iron Curtain East Germany the devil couldn't stop them I mean they rejoiced they were growing in strength hallelujah and of God and you if the devil could not stop them there he's not going to stop us here hallelujah we're going to have confidence if God could preserve us children there I mean he'll preserve you here hallelujah I mean that's why the devil lost in heaven he's going to lose upon the earth amen and now he is here but for a short time hallelujah and we're here but for a short time that should cause us to lead off the pressure hallelujah because now he's running out of time because you think he would finally finally realize well this was fulfilled and then I tried to stop this being fulfilled that was fulfilled I tried to stop this happening and it happened I tried to stop this happening I tried to stop Jesus being born but it happened I tried to stop the day of Pentecost but it happened I tried to stop the first church messenger coming and you're living the course and spreading the word I tried to stop him but he went and he spread the message I started to talk Timothy in that generation but they spread the word as well holy the life kept coming down I trying to crush it in the Dark Ages I couldn't crush it I mean I couldn't stop Elijah coming hallelujah go into this agent spreading the word pal ouya I invented the tape recorder to bring my own demise what's the first recorded words of the Prophet did we have these new recording gadgets Amy comes from days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to South all the messages of God should be finished so they had to be an invention I mean had to come upon the earth for this voice to be recorded holier for you to hear the voice hallelujah he couldn't stop it happening and then surely he'd begin to think I can't win but somehow he thinks yo-yo because he's so crooked he always thinks he can just have it sleight of hand and win at the end he's gonna recognize one day he'll recognize I just can't win a little but we should be able to recognize this as well let's just do the opposite this was fulfilled and it was this was fulfilled II got Tito and it did and this happen is fulfilled this happened to us fulfilled this is a prophecy this is a book of prophecy hallelujah this is all being fulfilled and if that's been fulfilled I'm gonna live out this path and it's gonna be fulfilled hallelujah we should let off the pressure glory to God shall we stand to our feet shall we hallelujah aren't you thankful I mean we're going to make it friends hallelujah we're not going to be left here in darkness hallelujah let's just live let's just thank him
