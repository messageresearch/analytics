[5:06] Lord but you place something on my heart
[5:08] that I have to share Lord. Lord may you
[5:11] take prereeminence in this service.
[5:14] this little thought Lord that's just
[5:16] come together Lord may it just be your
[5:19] name that will be glorified through it
[5:21] all may the revelation and the testimony
[5:25] and all the thoughts that's coming and

[5:32] control of any spirit Lord here that
[5:35] wants to hinder or distract or just be
[5:37] contrary to your word Lord may you may
[5:40] you take full control and feel welcome
[5:43] in our midst
[5:44] Thank you so much for the wonderful
[5:46] atmosphere that's been set by the saints
[5:49] of this body, Lord, and by the musicians
[5:51] in our dictim, Lord. Lord, it's a cold
[5:54] night, Lord, but may we sit close to
[5:56] each other in the spiritual as well,
[5:58] Lord, that we that we can have a fire
[6:00] that's burning, Lord. A revival fire
[6:03] from within, Lord, that will just spread
[6:05] out or we don't have any choice, Lord,
[6:08] and any any decision in the matter where
[6:11] you just go forth, Lord. um through your
[6:14] people and where we testify, Lord, of
[6:16] your goodness and your mercy in these
[6:19] last days.
[6:22] Be with all these chopped up words,
[6:23] Lord, now and have your way in Jesus
[6:26] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank you
[6:30] very much. Musicians,
[6:32] Josh, um
[6:35] you may you may take your seats and then
[6:38] we can we can read the word together.
[6:41] Thank you so much um uh for this
[6:45] opportunity that I can be here. Um,
[6:50] I don't know about the other ministers,
[6:52] but I really enjoy it when we are
[6:55] skeleton crew
[6:57] cuz then it feels like I'm preaching to
[6:59] myself and uh and and I am and I am
[7:04] everything that I will share with you
[7:05] today tonight is um absolute revelation
[7:09] that came to me and you'll see where we
[7:12] are in the scriptures how far this um
[7:15] how how far my revelation is within the
[7:18] word. I'm only now in Genesis and um and
[7:22] and so apart from the from the
[7:24] revelation, I will share just what the
[7:28] Lord's busy with, the testimonies that's
[7:30] coming through and I'll testify of what
[7:33] he does. Not what he's doing. Well, yes,
[7:36] what he's doing, what he's busy doing,
[7:38] not what he's done or what he might do.
[7:41] It's right now. We have to live right
[7:43] now here.
[7:45] Um, while you're standing, let's take
[7:48] our Bibles um and let's go to Genesis 1.
[7:52] Let's go to Genesis 1. And that's the
[7:55] last verse, verse 31.
[8:06] Say, there. Okay. And God saw everything
[8:12] that he had made, and behold, it was
[8:16] very good. And the evening and the
[8:18] morning were the sixth day. Then we jump
[8:21] to Genesis 2. Thus the heavens and the
[8:25] earth were finished, and all the host of
[8:28] them. And on the seventh day, God ended
[8:31] his work which he had made. And he
[8:33] rested on the seventh day from all his
[8:36] work which he had made. And God blessed
[8:38] the seventh day and sanctified it
[8:41] because that in it he had rested from
[8:44] all his work which God created and made.
[8:49] May God bless the reading of his word.
[8:51] You may have your seats.
[8:54] Um
[8:55] yes. So the the the revelation struck.
[8:59] Trying to still settle my nerves. I
[9:02] actually write on here settle the
[9:04] nerves. um
[9:06] you know just start start talking and
[9:09] you know how brother Brandon was as well
[9:10] he would just get something and just
[9:13] just make himself relax. I don't think
[9:15] you'll ever be able to relax in the
[9:17] presence of God. But in my theme, and it
[9:21] just came now, you can have it for free.
[9:23] We can rest in his presence. And this is
[9:26] where we're heading now. Right. So,
[9:29] settle the nerves. What I wanted to talk
[9:31] about here is this is not public
[9:35] speaking. I think if it was public
[9:37] speaking, I would actually not be
[9:39] nervous. Some of you would know I am a
[9:41] bit of a drama queen. you know, I've
[9:44] I've done drama in the past and all this
[9:46] kind of things and and I I remember I
[9:49] think I was oh probably Daniel's age. I
[9:52] think it was I was 7 years old where I I
[9:55] what's fra you you recite something so
[9:58] it's poems and I remember the one I got
[10:01] a a
[10:03] plus or a something and I was devastated
[10:06] because the other one I got a A++ and I
[10:09] thought why didn't I get two pluses for
[10:11] that one you know so I was 7 years old
[10:13] and I'm arguing with my mom in the car
[10:15] you know why did I you know so I was I
[10:17] was I was absolutely if it's drama or
[10:20] public speaking that I can do But the
[10:22] first time when brother ran uh brother
[10:24] Ben asked me to come and minister
[10:27] y that that was hard. That was so hard.
[10:32] What was my first message? I can't even
[10:34] remember. I hope it was not the the the
[10:35] the coffee one. Um I I need to still go
[10:39] and um refine that a little bit. But it
[10:42] was so unsettling cuz immediately if you
[10:46] had ever revelation
[10:48] that's a revelation of oh dear it is it
[10:52] is this is not public speaking you know
[10:54] you you are standing here and you're
[10:56] bringing a word and fresh mana in this
[10:58] season for saints of god for the body of
[11:01] Christ you know to edify them it's not
[11:04] just it's not just to motivate you this
[11:06] is not a a little all blacks locker room
[11:09] you know this is this is quite serious
[11:11] stuff this is life and death. So um yes
[11:15] and uh ever since I've I've been
[11:18] preparing as such. So
[11:21] um let us jump to yes. So there there's
[11:23] my theme for the night is is is rest.
[11:26] And I'll I'll take a quick little segue
[11:29] um away from rest but it does tie in
[11:32] together. Um this is the Lord that
[11:34] placed it on me and I was praying in the
[11:36] car. I go Lord so how do I bring these
[11:38] two together? But I think I think he he
[11:40] showed me. So, I believe he did. I I
[11:42] don't think I believe he did. So, the
[11:45] first little segue,
[11:47] um, this this popped into my head. I go,
[11:50] "Are you an eagle or are you a mircat?"
[11:52] I know brother Brandham usually talks
[11:54] about a buzzard or a eagle. and for my
[11:57] African brother and I still have some a
[11:59] Africa in me. Um,
[12:02] eagle and a and and a mia cat sort of
[12:04] just popped into my head and um and I
[12:08] thought
[12:10] well w with the idea of rest
[12:14] and what we read just now, why why did
[12:18] God need to rest? you know, what did
[12:21] what did we need to see for him to be
[12:24] able to do or or to do it, you know, to
[12:26] put that in in motion and and what was
[12:30] or what is that rest that hopefully we
[12:32] will find out tonight in this little
[12:34] journey that we have today. So, my first
[12:37] first segue here is this eagle and and
[12:40] and Mia cat. All right. So, obviously
[12:43] some of you would know what's a well
[12:45] what what's both of the um of the
[12:47] animals. So, let's run through it. So,
[12:49] I've got the eagle in the wild. Okay.
[12:53] So, there's the eagle. Uh, I wonder who
[12:57] can tell me what eagle is that. Oh, it's
[13:00] a fish eagle. And I was just thinking
[13:03] about that, brother M. And I wrote it
[13:05] down here. The Americans, you know, so
[13:08] spiritually, um, we've got way better
[13:11] spiritual named eagles in in Africa cuz
[13:15] Africa's got the fish eagle. We've got
[13:18] the crown eagle or the crest eagle.
[13:20] We've got the we used to know it as a
[13:22] white cross eagle. So on the back it's a
[13:25] black eagle and on the back of it it
[13:27] looks like a white cross that comes
[13:29] together and the and the tail feathers.
[13:31] Beautiful animal. We've got the batalure
[13:33] and and then in Congo I heard we've got
[13:35] the serpent eagle and then the Americans
[13:38] come with a bald eagle.
[13:40] I thought wow that doesn't really sound
[13:43] very spiritual but anyway. So I stuck
[13:46] with a fish eagle. There's some
[13:47] spiritual sign significance in that
[13:49] picture as well. Uh fish eagle in the
[13:52] wild catching what he does best, you
[13:54] know. And I thought, so what's the
[13:56] traits here of a of an eagle? And I
[13:59] wrote here an eagle in the wild. An
[14:02] eagle in the wild you can see is
[14:03] majestic, right? And it's so laser
[14:06] focused. It can be so high just just
[14:09] soaring there on the on the wind, you
[14:12] know, but it will focus. It'll see that
[14:14] fish in the in the reflection of the
[14:16] water, you know, it will catch things
[14:18] like fish and snakes and even goats, you
[14:21] know, to take it to its height. So,
[14:24] it'll take something from down here and
[14:26] bring it up here, you know, it'll take
[14:28] it to its nest or wherever where it's
[14:30] where it supernaturally operates where
[14:33] God's intended to to operate. And with
[14:36] that, I tied that little scripture of
[14:38] when the enemy shall come in like a
[14:40] flood, the spirit of the Lord will raise
[14:41] the standard. Amen. It shall she he he
[14:44] he he shall raise a standard says the
[14:47] scripture. I think it's Isaiah 59. Now
[14:50] we think okay a meat in the wild. So
[14:54] what is the this the stark difference?
[14:56] Obviously they are on the ground and
[14:58] they've got a burrow. They they tunnel
[15:00] under underground is their protection,
[15:03] right? But they always on the lift.
[15:06] They're always jittering, you know,
[15:07] they're always, you know, um um so
[15:10] attentive to what's going to happen, you
[15:11] know, never far from its borrow just in
[15:14] case something goes wrong, you know,
[15:15] from that little level of comfort or
[15:18] protection, but the protection is
[15:20] underground.
[15:22] So, how I tie these two is that he's it
[15:26] is never at rest, right? It is so
[15:29] attentive and so you know and I'm
[15:31] thinking in in the in the spiritual mind
[15:35] that meat would go is he bride is she
[15:38] seed you know did he did I share too
[15:40] much should I should I run from that guy
[15:43] uh should I um what should I share here
[15:45] or did it is you know within our
[15:48] spiritual uh uh application here we
[15:52] sometimes we have some meats that's just
[15:54] not at rest. It's not like Lord you
[15:57] lead. Hey Lord, speak through me. Lord,
[16:00] just have your way. Come sit here. Let's
[16:03] have a chat. You know, and that work
[16:05] it's a work situation. It's it's, you
[16:08] know, church as well. It's standing out
[16:10] there and someone comes and and walk the
[16:12] dog, you know. You you you you let him
[16:15] take over. Let you rest. Right. Now,
[16:18] we'll we'll get to how we rest. No.
[16:22] Okay. So, that is the animals in
[16:24] captivity. Now, here's the um the flip
[16:28] side. If if the mircat is in activity,
[16:34] it gets lazy, right? It doesn't it's not
[16:37] it's not it's I said here it's increased
[16:39] of goods in need of nothing, right? Nice
[16:42] little lazy fat one sitting there on the
[16:44] rock, not caring where's his burrow, not
[16:48] caring. I'm I'm getting fed. Um the the
[16:51] one on the left is actually uh taken in
[16:53] Tanaki. I remember um um it it it just
[16:57] becomes lax and doesn't worry about
[17:00] anything you know it becomes a pet
[17:02] becomes comfortable you know um
[17:06] eagle in captivity. Now the eagle in
[17:08] captivity is very hard to tame. So, you
[17:12] would see from that picture,
[17:14] just look at that talents, you know, um
[17:17] she's still got a a big thick leather uh
[17:20] strap and thing on there because just by
[17:23] landing it could just, you know,
[17:24] accidentally break her arm, you know,
[17:26] without really trying. Look at that
[17:28] beak, you know, look at the span, the
[17:30] wingspan. And and and it reminded me of
[17:34] um the story that Brother Brandon said
[17:36] about uh the eagle in the chicken coop.
[17:38] Now, now just imagine how scared the
[17:40] chickens are if that thing just in the
[17:44] morning just wakes up and shakes its
[17:45] feather and makes that little wingspan
[17:48] going out, you know, like all the
[17:49] chickens will be wo, you know, and just
[17:52] that big or or she that thing grabs with
[17:55] the talons some of the chicken feed or
[17:57] trying to feed itself, you know, it'll
[17:59] be so overwhelming for all these little
[18:02] chickens. They will always be scattered,
[18:04] you know. Yeah. So um
[18:08] from that aspect I think I can say I'm
[18:11] an eagle and I can say I saw on the
[18:15] wind. I fly higher. I have laser focus
[18:19] now that I have this rest in me and
[18:21] we'll get to where we go. Uh we how do
[18:24] we get there? I know where I'm heading.
[18:27] I can see far. I've got the eagle vision
[18:30] and I'm at rest. I will get fed. I'm a
[18:34] apex predator. I am above. Okay. So, you
[18:38] all still with me? Amen. All right. So,
[18:41] amen if you think you're an eagle.
[18:44] All right. Okay. So, I'm I'm in great
[18:46] company tonight. Great company. Okay.
[18:49] So, that was my first little segue and
[18:51] we will go back then now to our first
[18:54] scripture.
[18:56] Thus, the heavens and the earth were
[18:58] finished and all the host of them. And
[19:00] on the seventh day, God ended his work
[19:04] and which he had made. And he rested on
[19:06] the seventh day from all his work which
[19:08] he made. So this triggered something in
[19:10] me to go and look for. So what is what
[19:13] is this work? And God blessed the
[19:15] seventh day and sanctified it. Man, it
[19:17] sounds so authorative and so so clear
[19:21] and and there's some closure because it
[19:24] addressed from all his work which God
[19:27] created and made. So from that the word
[19:31] work there and I've got that little
[19:33] reference there at the top just to show
[19:35] you um I I'll I'll play around with it a
[19:38] little bit and and and show you it the
[19:40] word actually means and and I've
[19:42] highlighted there craftsmanship right it
[19:44] is it is yes an occupation but there at
[19:47] the bottom I also said workmanship okay
[19:51] so it's something a little bit more than
[19:53] just me going to my work on a 8our day
[19:57] there's some there's some above and
[20:00] beyond here. There's some there's some
[20:02] uh Michelangelo here. You know, some
[20:05] people returned from Italy recently and
[20:07] just, you know, boasting about you saw
[20:10] with Michelangelo and um but you know
[20:13] that that's not that's not work that's a
[20:16] work of art, right? So, right at the
[20:20] bottom there, I showed the the the the
[20:22] origin is from the same as that H4397.
[20:27] So remember that. So H4399
[20:31] is the word work which is the uh
[20:34] pronunciation is melac
[20:38] for notic yeah melacor and then here it
[20:42] just goes on the transliteration a
[20:45] deputy chip a ministry and I thought wow
[20:48] okay that ties in nicely with it's it's
[20:52] not just a work that god did that was
[20:54] his ministry right and I thought so when
[20:57] it relates to that thing um that um
[21:02] origin from that H4397 I went to look at
[21:05] what is 4397 4397 is Malik and that
[21:09] comes from angel or that is angel or
[21:11] messenger and see how ties that in the
[21:14] the King James version use that there in
[21:17] reference of a king and a messenger
[21:20] right and here it's as a as a deputy
[21:23] specifically of God and messenger so now
[21:26] you can see he's resting from his work
[21:29] is not just work. It's craftsmanship.
[21:32] It's a work of art. He would he left day
[21:36] six for a reason for day six for the
[21:38] last cuz I'm going to put my best in
[21:40] there and he was so laser focused to get
[21:43] something. And when he stood back from
[21:46] his ministry, when he stood back from
[21:49] him being king, him being the messenger
[21:52] coming and saying, "Let's make man in
[21:55] our image," he stepped back and said,
[21:57] "This is very good." Yeah. I I am happy.
[22:01] So, Michelangelo stepped back and he and
[22:04] he and he said, "Speak." You know, he
[22:06] was so so convinced this thing that he
[22:09] created was almost alive. he had to he
[22:11] had to punch it or he had to hit it with
[22:13] a hammer. So I thought, okay, there's
[22:16] there's a little bit more to to the the
[22:19] word work and and and and also how that
[22:22] ties to the word rest and why rest is so
[22:26] critical and so important in this. So if
[22:29] you would want to uh if you'd like to
[22:31] turn to your Bibles back to Genesis 2
[22:35] and we'll just quickly go there to verse
[22:39] 4.
[22:41] And I'll read that. I'll read that with
[22:43] you.
[22:45] Um
[22:48] uh here.
[22:51] So Genesis 2:4. We all there? Yes. Okay.
[22:54] So we read from verse 1 to 3 and then
[22:58] verse 4 goes on. These are the
[23:00] generations of the heavens of the earth
[23:02] when they were created in the day that
[23:04] the Lord God made the earth and the
[23:06] heavens. Okay. Right. So then we go to
[23:09] verse five. And every plant of the field
[23:11] before it was on the earth and every
[23:13] herd of the field. Okay. So then it
[23:15] carries on with that. Then we go to
[23:17] verse six. And there was a mist from the
[23:19] earth and watered the whole face of the
[23:20] earth. Like hold on. Okay. Then we go to
[23:23] verse 8. And God planted a garden
[23:26] eastward of Eden. And now he just
[23:29] carries on. That's not work. That's
[23:31] after this breast. But then I go, okay,
[23:36] so day seven. So let's quickly jump back
[23:39] and I'll show you what I'm trying to get
[23:41] to.
[23:45] And God saw everything he made. Okay?
[23:48] And the evening and the morning were the
[23:50] sixth day. That was sort of his
[23:51] confirmation. That's where the day ends
[23:55] and the new one begins. Okay? So day
[23:59] seven never ended.
[24:03] Day seven never ends.
[24:06] The seventh day never ends. That means
[24:09] when he rested, his rest never ends.
[24:14] Right? So there's no start of a new or
[24:18] another day. There's no start of another
[24:21] day. There's no eighth day.
[24:25] The seventh message never ends. The
[24:29] seventh message and the seventh seal
[24:32] never ends. We are in rest. It is
[24:37] complete. We don't have to look for
[24:39] anything else. We have it all right
[24:42] here. This word is reached. And I'm
[24:44] telling you, I'm at Genesis 2. We
[24:47] haven't moved even into this whole
[24:49] revelation of the open book yet, which
[24:52] is amazing. Right? So, what is this rest
[24:56] of the believer? Right? So now we're
[24:58] thinking um the Lord is talking about
[25:00] the seventh day now in this in this
[25:03] building that we're sitting. Isn't it
[25:05] ironic? They believe the seventh day,
[25:08] the Sabbath day is a Saturday. So we
[25:12] think, okay, we believe it's a Sunday,
[25:14] but
[25:17] we have more. What is the rest? What is
[25:20] is it a day? Must it be a day? Is it a
[25:23] is it some sort of day? And I thought,
[25:25] is it any day? Maybe it is a Sunday. But
[25:29] what I wrote here is a s o n day. S o n
[25:33] day. Sunday means the day you saw the
[25:37] sun. The day you looked away to Jesus.
[25:41] The day you came unto him. Is that your
[25:46] Sunday? Is that your rest day?
[25:50] How do we get this rest right?
[25:53] What is resting for the believer?
[25:56] Matthew 11. Come unto me all ye are
[25:59] burdened and are heavy laden and I will
[26:02] give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and
[26:07] learn of me. I like that and only
[26:10] recently sort of saw that and it jumped
[26:12] at me. For I am weak and lowly at heart
[26:15] and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
[26:20] Right? So we can go into that little All
[26:23] Blacks uh locker room and we can prepare
[26:26] as much as we can and we go out on the
[26:28] field and we smash Tonga or Samoa or
[26:31] whoever, but we haven't rested because
[26:34] we are resting in our souls. Okay? So
[26:38] it's nothing that will that will satisfy
[26:41] and suffice here on earth. We will rest
[26:44] in our souls.
[26:47] And each one of you take the drop. So
[26:49] now I'm jumping a little bit ahead of
[26:52] myself. So I'm going to park there.
[26:54] Let's park there. Okay. How do I get
[26:56] this rest? Okay. Uh and in some cases
[26:59] when when a when a sales guy come to you
[27:02] and he sells this product and you are
[27:04] convinced and you're concerned and you
[27:07] want to buy it, you says where do I sign
[27:09] up? You know this is like where do I get
[27:12] this rest? Where do I sign up? And
[27:14] interestingly, what I wrote here is um a
[27:18] testimony of me and and and and Sister
[27:21] Lundy's first baptism. Our first baptism
[27:24] was in the titles.
[27:27] We we were convinced that we had to get
[27:29] baptized. So, we grew up through the
[27:31] Dutch reformed and they bring a little
[27:33] baby and then they sprinkle it on the
[27:35] head with some water and off you go. You
[27:38] are baptized, right? So, you weren't in
[27:40] an age of accountability or anything
[27:42] like that. Churches split by the way of
[27:45] the way they sprinkled. So some actually
[27:48] sprinkled one big water
[27:52] waterfall over the forehead. Others said
[27:55] no no no you have to do it by the father
[27:57] by the son by the way. And some churches
[27:59] split just over that. So it just shows
[28:02] you in in a manmade thing and a thing
[28:05] that is not thought out and a thing that
[28:07] is not in rest. The thing that is not in
[28:10] the word uh it'll break. It'll it'll
[28:13] it'll shatter. It won't stand. Right. So
[28:16] So the testament of my our first um
[28:18] baptism,
[28:19] it was this time it was this time of the
[28:21] year and it was inu beach. We went into
[28:25] the water. Now you know how cold that
[28:27] would be. We make a nice big event of it
[28:30] and people stand on the beach and after
[28:32] which we've got soup. It's the first
[28:34] time I ate soup, brother Arman was
[28:36] afterwards and it was pumpkin soup. Your
[28:38] favorite. And we got baptized and it was
[28:41] just all this nice event. We arranged at
[28:43] that time all that that date everyone
[28:45] can be there and be witness. Yes, you
[28:47] need to have witnesses. But if the Lord
[28:50] presses on your heart, you need to get
[28:51] baptized. You get now like the
[28:54] Ethiopian. What have you for example?
[28:56] He's like where there's water. What is
[28:58] what is hindering us? That is how we
[29:00] need to be.
[29:02] But then we did it in the in the titles
[29:04] and and and I don't know maybe 3 months
[29:08] passed and sister Lond comes to me and
[29:11] say nothing's changed. The Lord says and
[29:14] we and that's what the Lord loves. He we
[29:17] take him to his word back to his word
[29:19] and we say but you promised I'm a new
[29:21] creation. I'm not a bandage. I'm not a
[29:24] little the muya Zambach that you put on
[29:27] and you just get better. I'm a new
[29:30] creation. I'm a new vet. I'm a new wine
[29:33] scheme. Where is that? Why are we still
[29:36] in this old rut? Old routine. There's
[29:39] nothing. What? What? Where's the
[29:40] revelation? Right. The Lord probably
[29:43] giggled because he knew that was that
[29:45] was the start of it, right? And we went
[29:47] on this journey. And praise the Lord, we
[29:49] had this this wonderful guy called um
[29:53] Brother Pete and he was a tall tall
[29:55] fella. So we had uh we had a tall pit
[29:57] and we had a short pit and we had a
[29:59] tennis pit and we had a pilot pit. So we
[30:02] had a lot of pits. Now tall pit come and
[30:05] he gives us his revelation from the
[30:08] knowledge of the word. Why do we get
[30:10] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:13] Christ and even though he went through
[30:16] the the way of the letter of the Lord,
[30:18] the letter of the word and the knowledge
[30:20] of that he was convinced that is it. and
[30:23] he brought us as a thesis to us and say,
[30:26] "Yeah, go investigate." And there's all
[30:28] his quotes, all all his scriptures, how
[30:31] it ties. He took the um uh um Catholic
[30:36] um uh uh uh encyclopedia and he said in
[30:39] that time they changed that word from
[30:42] Matthew 28 from the word Jesus Christ to
[30:46] the name of the father and son. He did
[30:48] all that research and said there you go
[30:50] invest in investigate. don't take my
[30:52] word for it. And we go, "Wow, okay." And
[30:55] read through the Bible and now this
[30:58] these scriptures now start jumping at
[31:01] us, you know, and that's now bringing us
[31:03] to here. Brother Brandham says, "And
[31:06] each one of you take the drop of Acts
[31:08] 2:38 this morning in your heart and just
[31:11] take it from there and watch him begin
[31:14] to break the bread of life to you." How
[31:17] nice. you repent, be baptized in the
[31:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[31:21] remission of your sins and see if the
[31:24] Holy Ghost doesn't drop in. Keep
[31:27] dropping on this and keep dropping on
[31:29] that. Dropping here and dropping there
[31:31] and dropping there and there will be a
[31:34] filling of the Holy Ghost. Right? Amen.
[31:38] You don't have to do to go to
[31:39] seminaries. You don't have to be smart.
[31:42] Only thing you have to do is recognize
[31:44] you know nothing. Let God have a hold of
[31:47] you. You take care. He will take care of
[31:51] the rest of it. And right down at in the
[31:54] end of it, he will take care of the rest
[31:56] of it. Yes, sir. Okay.
[32:00] Now, with that in mind,
[32:04] I um I read the scriptures in John. So,
[32:09] John 20, I think it's one of our next
[32:10] scriptures. And
[32:13] because I was sort of in this mind and I
[32:15] had this thought probably a few months
[32:17] already ago. Um this jumped at me and it
[32:21] said
[32:23] don't be like Thomas. I say Thomas the
[32:26] disciple. Yes. Thomas the disciple. What
[32:28] did Thomas do? You say he's one of the
[32:30] disciples. Well I can say Judas was one
[32:33] of the disciples as well. So what did
[32:35] what did what did what did Thomas do?
[32:37] Yeah.
[32:39] John 20. The other disciples therefore
[32:41] said unto him, "We have seen the Lord."
[32:44] But he said unto them, "Except if I
[32:46] shall see in his hands the print of the
[32:48] nails, and put my finger into the print
[32:50] of his nails, and thrust my hand into
[32:52] his side, I will not believe." And after
[32:57] 8 days again his disciples were with
[33:00] him, and Thomas with them. Then Jesus
[33:04] came or then came Jesus the doors being
[33:06] shut and stood in the midst and said
[33:08] peace be unto you. That is interesting
[33:11] that in the eighth day he then visited
[33:14] them and visited Thomas. Then saith he
[33:17] to Thomas reach hither thy finger and
[33:20] behold my hands and reach hither thy
[33:22] hand and thrust it into my side and be
[33:24] not faithless but believing. And Thomas
[33:28] answered and said unto him, my Lord and
[33:32] my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas,
[33:35] because thou hast seen me, thou hast
[33:38] believed.
[33:40] Blessed are you that have not seen and
[33:44] yet have believed. And we believe. We
[33:48] don't have to see the blood of the Lord
[33:51] Jesus Christ on the rock there in the
[33:52] garden of Gethsemane. We don't have to
[33:55] go to Gulfa and see there's a big empty
[33:58] space where maybe a a cross was there or
[34:02] the big open tomb was it because uh no
[34:06] we are convinced we believe we have
[34:09] faith and the reason why you've gathered
[34:12] here is because a you either got that
[34:15] peace already you've got that revelation
[34:17] and you have that rest
[34:19] and the other thing is um or you're
[34:22] finding it you're looking for it you are
[34:24] you are standing in the gap for someone
[34:27] for that uh and to to receive that
[34:29] revelation. That's why we're here and
[34:31] your testimony. What a powerful
[34:34] testimony from last week Sunday. Um,
[34:36] Sister Polling, um, me being through
[34:40] that situation, me being through the
[34:42] whole residency process and and and
[34:45] visas that will expire or that have
[34:47] expired twice and then going into
[34:50] residency and then um jumping um work
[34:53] and then have to restart and doing all
[34:55] that. It is impossible what happens with
[34:59] you. It is impossible.
[35:01] That's it. And I want to make a t-shirt.
[35:04] I claim this. It is not yours. I'm going
[35:07] to make money out of it. I'm going to
[35:08] say it's there's no way. And on the
[35:12] back, the Lord will say, "And that's my
[35:14] way." That's what happened here. Lord,
[35:17] it's impossible. The the the the the
[35:20] residency officer sitting there on the
[35:21] phone. It is impossible. I don't know.
[35:25] Call the minister. Call the MP. It is
[35:27] impossible.
[35:29] What is the evidence? Here we sit. We
[35:32] have the miracle, right? And through
[35:35] that, I would say a small little thing
[35:38] because that's here on earth, but we've
[35:40] got souls. We've got people that get
[35:42] healed. We've got people that's redeemed
[35:44] that coming and walk through back into
[35:46] this church. I'm like, amazing. Amen.
[35:50] And that's where we are. We don't have
[35:52] to be like Thomas. Don't be like Thomas.
[35:55] Don't be that little uh hat.
[36:00] [Applause]
[36:02] Okay.
[36:04] So, Thomas would um I'll just do a blank
[36:06] here. Thomas said he will only have rest
[36:10] when he had when he see the nail scarred
[36:12] hands and the spear woman Jesus's side.
[36:14] Jesus acknowledged that he now believes
[36:17] after he is seen. Right? So, how much
[36:20] more blessed will we be that believe and
[36:23] has not seen. So as we saw the empty
[36:27] cross and as we um see him raised up and
[36:31] see him live in us through us in you we
[36:35] have seen him healed and we have seen
[36:37] him redeem and what I wrote here and we
[36:40] see his grace forever more it will never
[36:43] stop. So now we've established that you
[36:47] are an eagle. Yes. Amen. Okay. You are
[36:50] either you either have rest or you are
[36:53] here because you are looking for it and
[36:55] you want to know how to receive it. Yes.
[36:58] And now you know. Right. So let's bring
[37:01] it all together.
[37:04] And this is interesting because this um
[37:07] the next slides, the two slides um
[37:11] came to me I think the second day when I
[37:14] was preparing this and it felt so out of
[37:17] place with my with my thought. Um but
[37:21] the more I read it and the more I
[37:23] prepared and the more I left it in here,
[37:26] I thought, "Oh yeah, but but that is it.
[37:28] That that that is the rest. The rest
[37:31] that you can't explain, I can't
[37:33] explain." So from my testimony for the
[37:35] last how many how many months 18 months
[37:38] um yes 2024 was a trial was a challenge
[37:42] was like you lord you pulling us where
[37:46] do we go where you know we have we have
[37:48] nothing and you're taking away what we
[37:51] where do we go 2025 came and a little
[37:53] bit of the same but then the Lord said
[37:55] but you've learned now through 2024 what
[37:58] are you how are you going to apply this
[38:00] and that's when I saw rest that's when I
[38:02] saw
[38:03] Wow. You know how how we pay the bills?
[38:07] Don't know. The Lord's got it in
[38:09] control. How am I going to get petrol to
[38:11] get to? Don't know. The Lord's got it in
[38:14] control. How are we going to The Lord's
[38:17] got it in control. Yeah, but the kids
[38:19] got, you know, pants. They need the
[38:21] school. And how about the groceries?
[38:23] They they eat like men, you know. Yep.
[38:26] Lord's got it in control. And not one
[38:29] day he's failed.
[38:31] You can go to my house. You can ask
[38:33] behind my back. You asked us in London.
[38:35] Like we would sit like the old couples
[38:37] there. And maybe you shouldn't ask this,
[38:39] but in bed we're sitting there like old
[38:41] couples. We love it. And we just chat.
[38:42] We just talk and uh and we go.
[38:46] We need help. Yep. Yeah. We need help.
[38:48] And the only thing we do is we we look
[38:51] away to Jesus. The only thing we do the
[38:53] only thing that helps. The only thing
[38:55] that's pulled us through everything from
[38:58] from our journey after that second
[39:00] baptism and when we came in by the way
[39:02] that second baptism
[39:04] we did it right. So there was a there
[39:07] was a a lady and I should have actually
[39:10] segueed into that from after our first
[39:12] baptism. Our second baptism when we did
[39:15] it correctly it was in it was a Friday
[39:18] evening. So we thought well you know
[39:20] we'll be the the holy rollers. will on a
[39:23] Friday night when everyone watches
[39:24] rugby, we'll have Bible study, right?
[39:26] And that Bible study was actually very
[39:28] edifying. It was really good for us. We
[39:31] we we we learned a lot through that. It
[39:34] was sometimes a debate and argue, you
[39:36] know, how people are and sort of um from
[39:39] a denominational thought and and
[39:41] including ourselves. But that night
[39:43] there was just a handful of people
[39:45] there. It was in the house and this tool
[39:47] bit his mom came and visited and his mom
[39:51] was like a straight shooter you know she
[39:53] she believed that word and she and Lundy
[39:57] and her she they are they are just
[40:00] having fellowship that's now first time
[40:02] where I see fellowship you know and that
[40:05] atmosphere comes down you know you feel
[40:07] it in the temperature you feel the
[40:09] tangible the thickness in the air and
[40:12] she goes what is stopping you now she
[40:14] asked London just nothing. And we run,
[40:17] we get into the hallway, we get the bath
[40:19] filled right to the brim, you know, now
[40:21] this body needs to get in there. So,
[40:23] it's like splash. And we get in there
[40:26] and it's like, okay, yeah, but remember
[40:28] now, we need to repent, be baptized.
[40:30] We're trying to follow this order
[40:31] because we've learned now from our first
[40:34] mistake, our first baptism. So, we want
[40:36] to do it according to the word. So,
[40:38] here's Acts 3:38. We get that book out
[40:40] and we and this is how we're going to do
[40:42] it. find a room and we go and I said,
[40:45] "Lord, sorry. Lord, forgive me. Lord,
[40:48] where have I been in this life and
[40:50] you've taken me from the muck and mire
[40:52] and all this darkness?
[40:55] Here's here's water, Lord." Like the
[40:57] Ethiopians said, "Get me. Let's let's
[41:00] let's do it now, Lord. And let me come
[41:03] out of that water changed. Let me be
[41:06] that new creation, Lord. that be the one
[41:08] that is hungering and thirsting for
[41:10] righteousness now.
[41:13] And we go in there and the wheels fell
[41:16] off, saints. The wheels fell off. The
[41:20] people that gathered for that Bible
[41:21] study scattered. We talking mats. The
[41:25] one has gone to Greek Orthodox Church.
[41:28] The other one has gone to the exclusive
[41:30] brethren. This this is all Christians.
[41:32] This is all in the same journey that we
[41:34] are here. We are believing the message
[41:38] of the hour. We are the we are the
[41:40] cults. We are the wayward one. You know,
[41:42] they still gather. They gather whenever
[41:45] they find the chance, they would gather
[41:46] and they would have a a little barbecue
[41:48] or a bri, but they won't invite us
[41:50] because we are the one that's cults, you
[41:52] know, we're the one that's wayward, you
[41:54] know. I go, well, praise the Lord. We
[41:56] had a little park pool club where we
[41:59] listened to the tapes of brother
[42:00] Brandham the the the life story that was
[42:03] uh preached by brother Jorgensson and
[42:05] that that hooked me. I came home
[42:08] bubbling and carpool disappeared. My car
[42:11] broke and the carpool left and everyone
[42:13] went different directions and different
[42:15] jobs and everything and that everything
[42:17] changed in front of our eyes. Now we
[42:20] look back we go that's a new creation
[42:23] right there. That's a change in her new
[42:25] white wine skin there. So I go, "Wow,
[42:29] praise the Lord." So then then I knew
[42:32] then I knew when I met the first time I
[42:34] met Brother Ben, probably not the the
[42:37] the best of conditions I saw him in, I
[42:40] think the Lord just felt of warmth. He
[42:42] said, "Yes, this is where I want you to
[42:44] be. Stick around. Stick around. Come
[42:48] find rest here cuz this is where you're
[42:50] going to find my yoke." So praise the
[42:53] Lord. There's a little testimony. So, in
[42:55] closing, in closing, and maybe maybe the
[42:59] musicians can come. But remember, in the
[43:03] stature that you are in this morning or
[43:06] this evening, if you weren't in his
[43:08] thinking, then you're not now. For you,
[43:11] there's some part that's in you that's
[43:14] eternal, saints. That's why you are
[43:16] sitting here. That's why you drove all
[43:18] the way here. That's why you came out of
[43:20] your little warm house to come into the
[43:22] cold here. That's why you are here. And
[43:24] in God was his thinking uh uh uh of you
[43:28] sitting where you are now. And his
[43:30] thinking I stood standing at the
[43:33] pullpit. Brother Brandon standing at the
[43:34] pullpit because he's infinite and he
[43:36] knows all things. Therefore, he could
[43:38] tell the end from the beginning because
[43:41] he's eternal. And you being a son of God
[43:44] or a daughter of God, then you were in
[43:47] his thinking at the beginning.
[43:49] And then when the Holy Spirit come and
[43:51] you're on earth walking around here as a
[43:53] sinner way down in your life there's
[43:55] something you don't know what's taking
[43:57] place but you're hungry. I heard the
[44:00] Presbyterian uh brother I heard the
[44:03] Baptist talking about back there he was
[44:05] a free will Baptist preaching he where
[44:07] he can my fellow brother that you
[44:10] there's something in you something that
[44:12] you never put in there. It's something
[44:15] that you couldn't desire to be in there.
[44:18] It's something that's contrary to your
[44:19] own nature. It's the fornowledge of God
[44:23] taking place. It's God's word. Repent
[44:26] and be baptized all of you in the name
[44:28] of Lord Jesus Christ for your remission
[44:30] of sin and you shall receive the gift of
[44:33] the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is your
[44:36] rest. The Holy Ghost is in you. You have
[44:39] rest. You do not have to run to and fro.
[44:42] We are now at the end of days. You just
[44:45] come to him. Lord, I don't know how. You
[44:48] know how. Lord, I don't know where to
[44:50] go. You know, wake me up in the morning,
[44:53] Lord. If it's 5:00, 7:00, 8:00, you
[44:56] know, I need to be there, Lord. Just
[44:58] follow him. Just enjoy his his presence
[45:01] in your house, you know, and the harmony
[45:03] and the peace that he will bring where
[45:06] the where the world would maybe look
[45:07] towards you and you go, you don't have a
[45:09] clue. You don't know where to go. The
[45:12] Lord knows and that's where we follow.
[45:14] That's where we go.
[45:16] So, thank you so much for that. Uh, I
[45:18] thank the Lord that he's placed that on
[45:20] my heart. Like I said, I did preach to
[45:22] myself tonight and it was just a
[45:24] revelation of who he is, what he's doing
[45:27] in my life. And trust me, I have rest. I
[45:30] have rest where I am, where I'm
[45:32] standing. Please pray for our pastor
[45:35] because every time I come up here, it's
[45:37] just incredibly nervous. And I've got
[45:40] always, you've seen me, I've always got
[45:42] a slide and a picture to draw your
[45:44] attention. A pastor that gets up here
[45:46] and doesn't have a slideshow. I go, "My,
[45:49] he needs to have such
[45:52] such verve, such real passion and a zeal
[45:55] to bring the word of the Lord that he
[45:58] doesn't need that. He he, you know, like
[46:01] I just pray that Lord bless him tfold,
[46:04] you know, in his family that he can do
[46:06] here, stand here day in and day out."
[46:09] So, please let's pray for our for our
[46:11] ministers. I'll just quickly
[46:15] um how we going to do this. Maybe I'll
[46:18] run through um while we pray, I'll I'll
[46:21] start doing the um the the the prayer
[46:23] requests. I'll go into prayer. I'll I'll
[46:26] switch off my microphone and then um
[46:30] and then uh we can we can pray. I see
[46:33] the prayer list feels to me like it's
[46:35] getting longer, but I'm thinking we're
[46:37] not getting sicker or further away or
[46:39] anything. We are seeing the evidence and
[46:42] we seeing the fruits of that prayer of
[46:45] the saints getting together here. Do not
[46:48] underell or undervalue yourself. You are
[46:51] a powerhouse sitting right here. And we
[46:54] come here by the authority of the Lord
[46:56] Jesus Christ and all our legs of fire
[46:58] coming together.
[46:59] The Lord, the Lord has to stay and has
[47:03] to be with his word. And if we repeat
[47:06] that to him. Oh my,
[47:10] oh my. Sorry, just getting the Yep.
