the Lord so just yeah reminder that we have our AGM uh approximately 2 p.m. today amen well praise God good to see everyone here today amen good to see brother Phil sister Belinda praise the Lord after your sabatical praise the Lord you're back on your feet and praise God we're so thankful amen let's um um let's go to acts 24 and we're going to read just two verses here and um yeah I'm going to go into uh what we believe today oh not a lot not going to be a list of doctrines it's going to be something a bit different but you know we believe the whole word I like how the Apostle Paul says this here this really surmises everything we could have just read this and praise the Lord and go of lunch but he says but I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward God which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the Dead both of the just and the unjust and here and do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense towards God and toward men amen so let's bow our heads in word of prayer you have a need just want to slip your hand up before the Lord today amen who wants the word of God to change them more and more amen gracious father we are so glad that Lord that song we just sung it's it's a testimony song Lord that we' have seen your word change us Lord it hasn't been our own selves changing us it's been you changing us Lord molding and shaping us into your image more and more and as we have the opportunity once again to gather as a people Lord I pray you'd come down lord in your presence and touch Hearts oh God touch lives and father be with everyone who's here also those who are streaming just want to remember brother oo Lord who unwell and body I pray you touch them Father and raise them up for your glory and anyone else who's not here today be their portion we submit ourselves under your Mighty hand today have your way may you be glorified Lord Jesus may you step out of History once again and walk among us we praise you we love you Lord we thank you that you're the same yesterday today and forever in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats today so I want to talk about what we believe uh because I've I've heard descriptions of um if I can just find my little Post-It note here I you I've heard descriptions about how people try and describe us of being between Baptists and Pentecostals and I thought that is the most dis disservice you could ever do to describe a Believer because we believe the whole word of God I me we don't believe just a partial piece of of the word and a bit of creed mixed in now we believe the whole Bible and the cover also from ker to ker and the also cuz the ker says holy Bible and we believe it's the word of God so the Apostle Paul will be standing here he's he's been called into question about what he believes as we know wherever God manifests himself there's always a bunch of trouble amen it's always been I want to kind of title this the trail of the pillar of fire Through the Ages amen because it's wherever God is and where where where man sees God manifest his word that that's where you want to be amen because just believing in a historical fact of Jesus resurrected from the dead it's not enough am historians can acknowledge that you've got to believe his word in the season that you live amen because you believe what he's done in your day it'll connect you back to the sacrifice of Calvary am mean because multitudes believe that Jesus died and rose again but there's no transformation of their life I mean they're still living in sin and religious people but we're not called to live in sin and be religious people we're called to be made in the image of his word amen the new birth is a definite experience you must experience I mean we're not here just to grow into something here to be changed amen that our old nature is dead and buried that old man is dead amen he's dead and gone he never lives again but Christ lives in you and I am me that's what the power of the blood does amen that's why Jesus died not just that we' become Christians or message Believers but his life would come and live in US am mean more than a tag more than a church but a god living in people once again amen see the Apostle Paul was standing here he says in the way they call heresy am mean so a lot of people called it heresy but who's the they the religious people of the day amen the scribes and the Pharisees and you know reading just from scoffield would say that you know when they when when Israel was carried into Babylon they had the before that they had the temple they had one basically levitical priesthood all those things but when they came out of Babylon they had the they had the um synagogue they had the scribes the Pharisees the Sadducees they had all different kind of sex and that's what happens when people come out of the world they bring a lot of religion of the world with them but the thing is it wasn't a controversy if you're a in Jesus day that would be fine yeah that's right no one called you a heretic if you're a sadducee well you're sad but hey that's still fine but you know that wasn't controversial if you're a scribe or a herodian whatever more because those things became the accepted Orthodox practice of the day but the thing is if you compared it to the word of God it was heresy amen because God promised Israel if they walk with him they will dwell in peace in their land they will not be occupied they won't be in bondage to any other Nation but they will occupy possess their Promised Land but you see the the church in that day had gotten so to a bad slump that they weren't even talking like Gideon did in the Old Testament saying if God is for us we're the Miracles where is that Supernatural God that once lived amen they didn't even ask those questions no more but they had gone into such a slump of just fussing and fighting and arguing about who's right who's wrong and we believe this and they don't believe that and I say sadly a lot of Christians get into that kind of a framework of what's your Doctrine here's my Doctrine my is right your doctrine's wrong no it's not this is not what Christianity is about it's a life amen it's a life of the Holy Ghost it's the word of God putting on flesh and and you and I amen because it's very easy just to list a bunch of dogmas but hey we're got to go beyond that amen see praise the Lord I'm just trying to maybe slow down a bit you know but see we don't just follow a uh you know the message is not long hair long faces long skirts and that's it you know it's more than just well there's one God and you get baptized in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ you got to address a certain way we are not just some kind of Pentecostal church that has Holiness we're not just where the gifts are the Apex of our existence no it's God the fullness of the word putting on flesh in you and I I mean it's more than an argument more than a more than just a well with just a progressed moved on kind of a movement that's come out of a denomination we're more than that because brother Ram says the second crucifixion of the word is happening in this day and it's not just the denominations but it's the independence I mean many of them kill the influence of the word that the word cannot have effect because if you think about it the effect of the word is people who are filled with the holy ghost walking according to the word loving the Lord above everything amen that's what that's what Calvary was meant to achieve that's why Jesus died that he would that you would be emptied of yourself he would fill you with his with his presence amen and his word would put on flesh in you and I that when you walk down the Bible the I mean walk down the road the Bible's walking down the road and mean when you go to your work go to your school it's the Bible stepping in there in flesh amen more than just memorizing verses but it lives in you and I amen so this is this is but you see people kill the effect of the word and it's not just in denomination or independent churches and many Mist churches as well where they quench the spirit they don't let God live because they have an idea of how it should be and that's it they don't let God live and I think we should let God live more than ever before the devil's living more than ever before and God should live more than ever before amen where we allow God to change us we actually are willing to surrender our thoughts our Ambitions our hopes our plans what we think we should be put it on his Altar and let him live amen so we're living in a day of the second crucifixtion of Jesus Christ but we're not here to and and brother Bram tells us in the indictment that the places where he gets his wounds is from pulpits amen where man will stand and just fuss and fight and stew but there's no life we need the life of God I'll get to my text soon but you know we need the life of God more than ever we need his word to have right away am mean God has been searching down Through the Ages with for that people would allow him to be king of their lives amen see they were he was king of Adam and Eve but then the fall happened and then now there's been a there's been a wrestling match between man's Fallen nature and God or what about the devil well the devil's in there too but really the devil got defeated that down Calvary doesn't have the keys to his own house the singer of death was p out every evil spirit has been conquered so what's the problem you and I human nature self is the problem amen self is the thing that gets man in trouble self is actually causing man to cause a nuclear war to happen amen if we can to get self out of the way God can do what he wants to do amen but you see the problem always is is when man mixes scriptures and quotes them with their own selfish Ambitions and me you see this is what happened here with the the Apostle Paul the people people that called his way heresy they were mixing scriptures they said to even Jesus we have Moses we're moses' disciples but he said to them if you really believe Moses you would have believed me cuz Moses wrote Of Me amen so they they could point back to historical God but they had forgotten what the very Promises of God that were meant to be manifested in their day and when the word became flesh they wanted to crucify him because we understand that God is his word it's very simple but it's so important that God is his word and we've been taught by the prophet Messenger to get away from God Is by getting away from his word it's that simple amen so if you put your ideas above the the word of God you've stepped away from God because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men so God is his word amen and we are not called just to believe part of his word but all of his word amen I've never seen a a wedding take place where a where a where a bride marries just an arm of a bridegroom yeah I've never seen a part of a person be married to a complete person who's ever seen that no one's ever seen that have you but you see this is what people will do is they will take part of the word that they like and they will disregard the things they don't want and they'll say well I'm a Christian because I believe this part we're going to take the whole word of God amen we can't just take part of it but you see now there's always been down Through the Ages there's always been a trail of when God manifests himself and that is where people they have to receive him or reject him Moses Moses could have um you know by the time Moses came on the scene Abraham had already come and you know they could have discussed what everything that God did in Abraham's life and that was all perfectly fine they could have talked about what Noah did that's all perfectly fine but you see when God came down and spoke to Moses now this was a different season see all that God did was perfectly fine but the thing is you've got to look at your attitude now towards the word of God what your attitude now is towards the word of God is what your attitude would have been then amen so when when God came down there and spoke to Moses now you know there were some people who stayed in Egypt there were some people who just explained the Miracles away there's some people whose Hearts just got hardened and so what that attitude was back then is what you'd have that same attitude now cuz it's very easy to say I would have been on the ark with Noah I would have been the ninth guy on right come on but what's your attitude now see because your attitude now is what your attitude would have been back then cuz that was Christ being manifested amen it was a man building an ark for the Salvation of the world but that was the word being made flesh am mean so that was where God was it's you know they could have maybe maybe there would have been people there for for that 120 years that Noah was building the ark they could have been discussing what it was like in the garden and what Adam and Eve would have done and Enoch being raptured and all these things but that didn't help them if they didn't get in the ark that's right see it's very easy to say well Jesus died 2,000 years ago rose rose again but what are you doing with him now what are you allowing him to do in your life now you see so it's not just a historical you know yes it happened but what's it done to you what's his word what is he doing today in your life you see so it says here by faith Moses when he came to years refused to be son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming their approach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt so Moses followed Christ you say that was God in a burning bush yeah but that was Christ in the burning bush that was God manifesting himself speaking to Moses he says I have heard the cries of my people Exodus chapter 3 and I have come down to deliver them behold I'm sending you to do the job so in other words God came down commission Moses stepped into Moses and went into Pharaoh Pharaoh's court because when Moses would say to Pharaoh let my people go they weren't moses' people they were God's people that was God speaking through Moses so when you saw that 8year old man with a stick and his brother there Aaron walking down into Pharaoh's Palace there that was the manifestation of the word for that day am me that was God putting on flesh manifesting the promise that he gave to Abraham for UND years before so now now we would have to make a decision are we going to listen to this man who just speaks a critical judgment on on the superpower and the world we live in are we going to you know are we going to listen to this man or are we going to stick with the gods of Egypt what are we going to do I mean the we're going to put our I like to put myself in the Bible story who who I like to step back in time and say what would I do if I was there sure there's Supernatural signs and different things happening but you know what would I do would I stay in Egypt or would I follow amen and then when you know when Moses instructs the people that there's going to be the death Angels going to come in the land am I going to kill a lamb you know death is a rough thing it's a horrible thing who's ever seen a a sheep be killed and butchered or a cattle Beast or something it's not a glamorous thing it's not like one minute you know the Beast is killed Nick minute it's in a polis you know thing in the supermarket there's a lot of it's It's a Grizzly thing death is not pretty right and then even the even the children of Israel they told you have to have this Lamb with bitter herbs so humanly humanly it's not really a it's not a sweet thing I've got a sweet tooth oh boy but God instructed them you've got to roast this Lamb with bitter herbs you have to eat it this way it's not a sweet thing for this for this Blood to be applied humanly because there's God's Will and your will both can't be in the same place amen one has to die in order for the other to live a lot of people say yes I'm a Christian but it's their will running around doing their own thing but no it should be we must die and he must live that's what real repentance a real death to self is it's not my will but thy will be done and not my and and it's and it's not my will but thy will be done when it suits me that's right it's all the time amen it's all the time so they had to have it with bitter herbs says eat it not of it raw nor soen at all with water but roast with fire with his head with his legs and with the perance thereof that's the guts that's the bits you don't normally go buy in the supermarket but what he's saying is you've got to offer the whole lamb you to take remember the lamb represented Christ represents the word he is the word so you can't sacrifice part of the word you can't just have the nice parts of the your favorite instagrammable scriptures that you just posted # and this is lovely and love Jesus and peace love and good no no it's it's the whole word you can only apply the blood to your life if you receive the whole word of God and there's not some Knowledge Test you know no you've got to say yes this is all you Lord this is not just me and my ideas mixed in no you got to take the whole word of God see they could not just take part of the Lamb they had to kill the whole thing yeah I mean they had to eat the whole thing they' have it with bitter herbs amen and humanly it's a bitter thing to die or anything's bitter to die I me we got to be willing to to die out to our old nature and let the blood be applied I mean and not just eat the nice spits but with the guts and everything on the inside the whole word of God you see how can the blood be applied if you if you don't receive the whole word of God where you come across one thing and the spirit in you says no I can't do that that's for another age that's the wrong idea you no the blood's not applied then amen but if the blood has being applied well what are you talking about the blood being applied well you know the blood's been applied you if the baptism of the Holy Ghost has comeing if God himself has stepped inside amen because the life and the blood is what's the most important thing see we could have a genuine vile of certified blood of Jesus Christ that would be an incredible thing to have but it's but now don't get me wrong but just having that blood physically is not going to take me in a Rapture it's the life and that blood's got to come into me change me amen and then what happened now I'm now New Creation in Christ Jesus now I'm ready for the Rapture right so just to physically have his blood like the Catholics have I don't know how many nails they have you know it's like having a piece of uh you know the den room of brother Bram or some some some Relic from Jeffersonville that's not going to help you none I mean no you got to have the life that was in the Holy Ghost and the prophets got to come into you amen you know seeing those things I'm not too interested if you've gone I'm I'm glad you went but it's not on my bucket list to see those places personally I'd rather go to the on the mission field someone who really needs God I'd rather go somewhere like thaten but hey if you want to go go okay I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad thing you want to go see it go for it enjoy take photos tell me how it was but personally that's not going to help me because I've met the God who sent the message I mean I've met that Pillar of Fire I've met the mighty Angel himself I mean I don't need to know everything about the prophet to be a believer I've met the word himself and that's the main thing that you meet the word don't be caught up in his life story only no receive the Revelation that he broughten amen I'm not angry okay if if I say I'm not angry I'm just passionate hey I've been in places where people are way more passionate than this I've been down to Chile and man in church they're like it's like a football game but it's an eternal thing amen and they're all their heart soul and mind is in it why because Jesus has redeem them they're happy and I'm I'm the same way I'm sorry I'm just glad that he found me he redeemed me he washed me am mean so we want to contend for the faith that wants delivered to the Saints why because we want to see God live like never before you know my heart's desire desire is the day of the Rapture this place is empty where people start searching where where' they go and we're gone we're all gone there's no one turning up here looking for church and most of us aren't here that's my heartest desire we all go as one big Ransom group amen so let's not be caught up in the lukewarm Spirit of the age amen let's be on fire for God am mean to realize we don't serve a system we don't serve a denomination we don't serve even Jeffersonville or some list of beliefs we serve Jesus Christ the revealed word amen so so you'd have to decide what would you do would you would you listen to this 80-year old man with a stick in his hand and you know and say yes that's Christ sir and then you would follow him and then You' come to Mount Sinai now what would you do if you um one of the 12 Spies and you weren't Caleb with Joshua if there were 13 spies and I was one of them there would have been three giving a good report Caleb Joshua and me why because I believe his word today my attitude today is it would have been the same back then amen so if I wasn't one of the spies but yet they came in then the other 10 were you know giving an evil report there would have been a scripture injected into the scripture but being of the tribe of whoever said no we're more than able to take the land don't listen to these 10 they're lying to you am mean God has revealed himself he's true this is not Moses is doing this is not you know Aaron's doing this is God's doing amen God is fulfilling his word can you not see it people can you not see this is the fulfillment of a prophecy given to Abraham amen and this should be the same thing with you and I today can you not see this messages Jesus Christ revealed it is the son of man revealed it's not even a healing M Ministry only not a prophetic Ministry only it is God himself being made known amen so it goes beyond an argument we're not here to follow just some Bible school or no we're here to follow the whole word of God Amen like Paul would say that he he said he believes where are we believing all things which are written by in the law and all the prophets he was called crazy cuz he believed the whole Bible I'm just bringing today's language you say they they think I'm off my I've gone off on the deep end because I just believe the whole Bible I don't believe part of it I believe from ker to ker and the ker also I believe the whole thing this is why this is why they're calling it heresy and the Apostle Paul what he did is he actually because in those days the scribes and the Pharisees they injected tons of laws on man-made laws into the word of God and so and that was considered Orthodox ways right to mix man's ideas oh what they call it midrash midrash it be as human sayings it becomes scripture and I think it sounds like some physical midrash you need some cream to get rid of that midrash you know it sounds like a real bad thing to have but that's what they were suffering from midrash amen but you see the Apostle Paul came along and said no the Bible is the infallible word of God we don't need man's idea we don't need man's Creeds all we need is the word of God and that is the same thing that is what we believe amen that God has taken away all the midrash hallelujah amen through through a Channel of Malachi 4 he has taken away all the midrash he's tied up all the loose ends of the scripture people were debating about different things and those things have all been restored amen so that's why we say we believe the Bible it is our absolute amen and not because we and and and and the reason we can say that is not because we just say well we just don't are not denominational no because God through a Channel of Malachi 4 has restored the word of God look you can see now the Elijah when he came the first time Elijah himself on Mount carel it says that He restored the altar of the Lord that had fallen down so that worship approach to God had fallen down and what happened God inspired Elijah you going to rebuild this altar I mean because they have to see my fire come down and consume the sacrifice so he didn't build a new he didn't build a new altar he Resto the altar that was already there and I say there have been Revelation stones that have been neglected am mean simple things like being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God being one spirit manifested in different ways different different Revelations that have been neglected Through the Ages what God inspired brother Brown that you know prophet of Malachi 4 what to restore the approach to God so now it's not just an anointing of gifts but it's gifts and The Giver me it's the giver on the inside it's that true Pentecost fire comes down that God dwells on the inside so now the spirit within the believer copes with the word of God that it's not us fighting the word no it's us saying yes Lord amen to the word of God and that's the biggest sign you have the Holy Ghost is you will put the word of God above your own opinion am mean you'll put it above the Fashions of the world you put it above the culture of the world you'll put the word above all those things amen sorry I don't have a first gear I'm just going this fast okay but you see you've got to realize it if you if the spirit within you can't cope with the word of God you get rid of that spirit you say God take that religious spirit out of me and give me the holy ghosten if you cannot cope with the simple things of the Bible cuz remember brother Bram said you know because they wanted to say teach us algebra that we can you know have deep spiritual things he says how can you know algebra if you won't have your ABCs and ABCs has always believe Christ and Christ is his word amen amen praise the Lord so there was there would been that challenge that day amen even in down through the Bible when the prophets came there'd be a challenge can you accept that Prophet when he came amen and so your attitude now will be your attitude then see there's always been people down through the scripture that've been bitterly opposed to the move of God they've been on fire for the move of God and they've been indifferent yeah that's right which one are you today I trust you're the on fire for the word of God category oh yeah amen not the Bly opposer not the indifferent amen if you feel indifferent that's a spirit making you indifferent amen I'd say Satan get away from me in the name of Jesus Christ I'm not made to be indifferent I'm made to be on fire amen I'm made to be passionate I'm made to be happy and rejoice Amen in the god of our Salvation so you see so Moses Moses followed Christ out of Egypt and then Joshua that same God changed form as the captain of the host of the Lord and then he took over where where Moses left off amen because God told Joshua my servant Moses is dead take ye therefore these people and go over the river Jordan into the inheritance right amen so so God would come down through many different ways then then now you you we skip Way Forward down to King David's time he was a man he was on the run from King Saul he had a few Supernatural testimonies but the challenge would be would you rally to David or would you stay with denominational King Saul that all he did was sit there and criticize what God was doing who would you gather to because we know C A David was a manifestation of the word I mean cuz even Moses I believe said that that you'll have Kings one day amen so he was actually a manifestation of the word because remember when Samuel anointed David amen it said the spirit of God was with him from that day on so now you would have to look at this man who is a renegade he is on the run from his own people and you would have to look and say is this God or is this not your attitude today would be the same thing because if you really know God today you would have been one of the Mighty Men am mean you would have gathered to him when he was on the run you say you're my King David amen you're coming into power Hallelujah that that's what you do amen when he cried out I want to drink from The Well of Bethlehem there wouldn't have been three mighty mean there would have been four you would have been the fourth man amen or the fourth woman saying let's go get our captain a drink am mean cuz his greatest desire became a the least of his desires became a great commandment to them amen so he didn't even say give me a drink he just longed for a drink amen and they took it as a commandment and they fought their way through those Philistines to get that drink why because their attitude was this man has been anointed by God this man amen has been ordained by God to sit on the throne and and totally occupy the promised land amen so we're going to gather to them gathered to him and the sign they gathered is the same anointing on David Came Upon them I mean because David killed a lion and a bear and Goliath did many mighty exploits and those Mighty Men did the same things they killed Goliath's Brothers they killed those giants they did Mighty things why because the anointing on David Came Upon them amen so that's a sign that you really really believe this word is because the anointing on the anointing on the Lord Jesus the anointing on the apostles the anointing on the prophet comes upon you and you do great exploits in this end time hallelujah amen I trust that's you today this is what we believe amen we don't just believe in a historical God many people can point to a founder of some movement say yeah back then but not today that's a lie amen we shouldn't just look at a Founder we say yes he's still the same God's still the same today am mean he hasn't changed one bit Hallelujah so that would have been a great challenge in that day amen but what about you today amen you see there's always been prise the Lord Jesus would be would ask his disciples when they came to the coast of Cera Philippi asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some say Elias others Jeremiah or one of the prophets now the reason they could say this is because what they read about those prophets doing they saw Jesus do and we know the prophet were a portion of God expressed but when Jesus came the fullness of the godhe bodily dwelt in him so it's like if you take white light you put it through a prison it becomes a rainbow right so each of those different colors are a portion of that white light God is the white light but he but he put a portion of himself down Through the Ages down through the prophets right but then he wasn't just a portion in Jesus no that was God made flesh that was Emanuel that was the word made flesh and dwelt Among Us so all that God was he poured into Christ so that's why they could say well you're one of the prophets because this is what we see but then he asked the question but whom do you say that I am this is such an important question because this question is actually asked to every believer down Through the Ages who do you say this is amen as we looked at Noah very briefly and Moses and David and you know all the you Joshua different prophets down through you could ask the same question who do you say this is yeah who is this well this is this is Elijah the tshb look again who do you say this is well this is God revealing himself through a prophet who do you say this is well he's Moses no look again look Beyond the Veil this is the biggest problem is man gets so caught up in the humanity that God reveals himself through brother Bram would say one the hardest thing pardon to do is for a mortal to get another mortal to believe them one of the hardest things to do is actually a man to believe another man why because man is always looking at carnality and humanity and different things we got to look Beyond those things so he asked the question but who do you say I am see this is see they the Jews around thought he was a prophet raised from the dead but then Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered said unto him blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I Al and I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now we know that the Catholics take these series of scriptures and they say well Peter is the rock the church is built upon but but that's not that's not the discussion that's going on the question is all about Revelation who do men say I am what's been revealed to those guys out there well you're one of the prophets but what's been revealed to you glory amen and then and then when Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus says bless out thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven so in other words Simon Flesh and Blood your your mind your top two inches didn't work this out I mean people didn't work this out and tell you no my Father which is in heaven revealed the sovereignly to you that you could look Beyond this Humanity that I dwell in and see deity hallu amen that that that yes I am the Christ I'm I'm the same one that Moses followed I'm the same one that led Joshua I'm the same one that Led Led David and and and you know all the and all the Believers down through you know Ezekiel Saw me as a wheel within the wheel and different things but yes I am that one but now I've been made flesh and see so what is he he was the word made flesh and that same question is actually posed to you who do you say this word is that's right who do you say this message is is it is it just a Healing Ministry is it just a prophetic Ministry is it just correct Doctrine or is it Jesus Christ revealed is it Christ himself revealed because if you really realize that we don't have a group of like a collection of an argument say this is truth no truth is more than just I believe this and this and this and this and this is why full stop this is true and mine is Right compared to yours no truth is a person Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life amen so truth is not just a collection of argument no it's a person being revealed amen so it's Christ as the truth so when he is revealed amen the believer the all the Believers is here to say that's him and then line up with him rally to him amen amen so this is the question you see what's being revealed to you I say this message is more than healing more than a prophetic Ministry more than correct Doctrine it is Jesus Christ himself being revealed through a prophet amen because if you can see Christ in your day then you are built upon the rock of Revelation amen and then he says that Upon This Rock I'll build my church I'll build my called out ones Upon This Rock of Revelation that's why we should pray for Revelation more than ever pray Lord Reveal Your Truth to me Reveal Your word to me Lord make yourself known to me amen that it's not human influence that guides me it's you guide me in your word amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen and we know gates are designed to stop access but God promised in the Old Testament that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy amen and when the Lord Jesus conquered hell death in the grave the of the woman possess the gates of the enemy and because we come under that same blessing what we shall possess the gates of our enemy when the enemy tries to stop a promise coming to pass no we're going to possess that gate I mean when he tries to hinder your walk no you're going to possess that gate why because you're built upon the rock of Revelation amen amen if you can see this is Christ in your day amen it'll change your whole life amen if you can see beyond just a kian's voice but hear the voice behind the voice it'll change your whole life we believe the whole word of God amen come on now amen amen hallelujah you see even even um Jesus would would would speak about John and uh Jesus would say ye sent unto John he bear witness unto the truth but I Reed not testimony from man but these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and a Shining Light and you are willing for a season to rejoice in his light what so so what is light in the Scripture it is the word being fulfilled so Jesus was saying he was a bright and Shining Light why was that because he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare you the way of the Lord he wasn't a disgruntled anti-establishment religious guy that's right he was fulfilled prophecy John was the Fulfillment of Isaiah 40:3 am mean he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 the first part where Malachi 4 says the first part says he and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's what the angel told his his um um his parents there in in Luke chapter 1 that would be the that would be the reason John was sent to turn the hearts from the traditions of the fathers the law to turn them to the new faith in Jesus Christ so he was a bright and Shining Light cuz his life was a fulfillment of scripture and that's what we follow here we follow the Fulfillment of scripture I me we talk about brother Bram talk about Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 the son of man being revealed the book of redemption coming open all that is is fulfilled scripture in our day that's right it's nothing else amen it's fulfilled scripture it's nothing that's been added to or injected it is the word being fulfilled amen that's why if you look at there's always been controversy when the word is fulfilled you see the Jews were looking for the Messiah it wasn't a mystery that you know that that a messiah would come and deliver them they were all looking for it you see so they would have sat around no doubt and and debated how he would come and what he would do and all these different things and sure that probably would have ended up just just with a nice debate but then when he came and he came the way they didn't expect they expected no doubt be born in a palace he'd be a general he'd be a mighty conqueror amen but he was a baby born in a manger amen and and he was born in a place that though the Bible said he'd be born there this you know the religious people didn't go and see his birth it was humble Shepherds that were that the birth was announced to it was wise men from afar was different ones but you see he was the Fulfillment of the word and because he was a fulfillment of the word that's why the devil wanted to kill him isn't it amazing where where Jesus would come in he do a miracle he'd like you a man with a withed hand in the synagogue would heal them and do things on the Sabbath day according to the word of God and the more he did the more they wanted to destroy him that's right isn't that a strange thing I mean you think the more he did the more they would have rallied yeah amen but you see that religious spirit hates the word being fulfilled amen they would talk all day long about Moses and and Elijah and all the prophets of old but but when the God who sent those prophets became flesh they wanted to destroy him amen that's why you know you look in the scripture and they wanted to Stone him and throw down a cliff and different things but isn't it interesting that the disciples were there with them yes they weren't trying to Stone them but you see they were following the word but they hadn't become one with that word yet even though they were prophesied to be part of that word because God said that I'll call the people for my name's sake right but they are walking with the revealed word but because that life wasn't in them yet the enemy wasn't trying to destroy them you see but then after the day of Pentecost is when they dragged them in before the Sanhedrin you beat them and threaten them and all different things why because that same Pillar of Fire that was in Jesus Christ now came into them in the upper room I mean so now the life of God they were the Fulfillment of the word for their day amen did that what you say does that take away from what God just did no it's a further fulfillment of what he did because remember God God has been walking down Through the Ages fulfilling his word amen amen down Through the Ages the pillar of fire has been moving and those have been predestinate see him move and they become one with it amen you see so that's why I can say we are following the Fulfillment of scripture amen so John was a bright and Shining Light but we couldn't just stand around and rejoice that God had sent a forerunner that's right amen but we had to follow the Messiah that he identified amen and brother Brown's Ministry was to identify Christ in the scripture I mean to introduce us to the Lamb of God once again I mean not to introduce us to Creeds and opinions of man but to introduce us to the word of God Amen so just like there acts I believe it's 19 there were 12 disciples of pooll and different ones all they knew was the that Christ had come he had given his life they were preaching but they didn't know the coming of the Holy Ghost they weren't even baptized right and they were dancing around with what God had done in the past but you see the light had moved on so when Paul came his way he brought them into a further part of the word and they received it and they received the Holy Ghost that's why we're not dancing around God sent a prophet that's righten that was in the past God sent him do we do away with it no but now we say what did he say what did he preach what was that Ministry sent for and that Ministry was sent to unite a people with the word of God am mean that we become the word of God made flesh I mean that's why now we talk about what there's a bride coming of Jesus Christ am mean we've been restored back to a true Pentecost where God lives in his people if I'm going too fast I'm sorry I'm just this is just where we're going okay but I just want you to really get we believe the whole word we believe the Bible around here okay we don't have a church document of opinions of man and writing things no those days are gone amen amen no we have seen the pillar of fire in this day and we've seen him live and we are eyewitnesses of His Majesty eyewitnesses of his Mercy we have a testimony I'm not just talking about we have a testimony that he lives amen that he proves his word hallelujah that's why we can say we're not just pointing back to God in a prophet no we see the god in that Prophet alive today amen God didn't go off the scene in 1965 no he had to take his Prophet off the scene that we become one with the word that there's a people come on that that are people come on the earth and not caught up with the prophet anymore it used to be people so enamored by Brother Bram and all these things no but a people have moved on to the word he came to give I mean it be like in Jesus's day it would be a bit foolish to be caught up with John the Baptist when John's already introduced you to Jesus don't you think so amen should really move with the program and walk with the word amen so you see now um those disciples who in the book of Acts they had to be re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they received the Holy Ghost amen they begin to walk in the light of the day yes praise the Lord hallelujah amen now but here's the thing I said before I mentioned this on Wednesday so I thought i' put a picture up people love to have an emotional connection with a historical Jesus now as I say this I'm not doing away with the with the cross some people think it's one or the other no I believe the whole word of God like people in Paul's day would say uh no stop quoting Paul you need to quote more of the red letter of Jesus and they they have no understanding that what Paul was speaking was the same Christ that was speaking the red letter he just changed form right so many people are just caught up with an emotional idea I've seen you know songs on YouTube they have clips of passion of the Christ and it's it's very moving yeah you get brought to tears yeah you know but a lot of that's just an emotional connection with a picture but then what about now when when when people are confronted with the word it's very easy to be caught up and worthy as the lamb and you see him being beaten and mad and it's very emotional it it is that's my savior they're showing he was mad more than that and he was mad for me that makes me emotional when I think about what he did for me I feel this big Lord I'm So Unworthy but you're so good that you do it for me I feel I get emotional but you just can't be caught up in an emotional attachment amen because when you come people's ways now this is not very controversial but it's very obvious where people say they love this the idea of this but they won't follow the Plan of Salvation to actually meet God you know it's very it's very simple here repent be baptized everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call see the emotion that was there if it's just a religious spirit goes away when it comes to this because they'll take they'll take this any day when it comes to actually surrendering to the word that hung on Calvary it's all out of the picture you see but if you actually have the spirit of Christ you'll say yes Lord amen that's you Lord that's you being revealed I mean that's not Paul's I mean that's not Peter's opinion he didn't contradict Matthew 28 no he knew the the name of the father son Holy Ghost amen as we're standing there the Solomon's one fell name belong Papa picking and know Holy Ghost those are just titles that's not his name Peter stood up in the name of Jesus Christ he knew the name of the father son Holy Ghost amen as as Jesus said I come in my father's name and you receive me not what's the name of the father Jesus it's not complicated but you see so they would they would keep this above following this amen and then even even things that we take from for granted like expects in 1 Corinthians 11 how a woman should have uncut hair amen cuz it shows that her head is the word of God Amen and there's power for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels there Angelic protection and we know we have a living testimony of these things that they're true amen but you see I'm just I'm just to save time I'm not going to read it but you see now he says he says but if a woman have long hair it's a glory to her and her hair is given her for a covering see man says no you need to wear a a a thing you know a hat but the Bible says very clear no the woman's hairs are covering and that word long means to let grow that's right it's very simple so people will love this but when it comes to this no they don't want it that's right what spirit's motivating that person but we believe the whole word of God I mean you take the modern church today they would they would rip this out of their Bible let a woman learn in silence and with all subjection that I suffer not a woman to teach nor you super authority over with a man but to be in silence amen religious spirit loves this I'm I'm just you know but they'll say no Paul said this because of the cultural reasons of the day they'll explain it away amen but we say amen amen amen well what about in well silence in church can't they say Amen absolutely can they run the aisle a amen amen can God use gifts in them absolutely cuz that's God doing it amen you see but you see so all those things are here well then how about this one see a lot of people come to the message because what brother AR teaches they already agree with but in the wrong way like he says you men you meant to be heads of your own house how can you let your house be out of your woman your wives run a m and all these things they say yes because they're dominating they're not actually governing their house with love love should be the king of our home amen it shouldn't be now you lot listen XY Z this is a military Barracks you better conform otherwise milary police are going to run you around for a couple of years no that's not it it's love the love of God should be so influential in our homes and our lives that our family want to serve him even if okay we all you even having struggles whatever but deep down they want to serve God right so likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge that's their wives amen see H how about that where man would say no I don't want to dwell with my I don't want to understand them I don't need to understand them they just need to obey me that spirit is actually disagreeing with this word amen well they're just made of different material yeah but God understands us amen and we're the woman right amen can we not understand our wives amen I'm kind of I don't mean to GL I'm I'm just throwing some things out there because I want you to think about it because it's easy to talk about baptism and uncut here all these things but what about everyday living everyday living cuz remember our family should not be dictatorship that's right no there not dictatorship it should be the love of God you know if you have to yell and scream and throw fits and and and and and and what do you call it you know uh basically yeah just do all those kind of things to govern your marriage you got problems and the problem actually because remember you point a finger there's three pointing back at you amen because the head of the house should live in such a way an atmosphere should come down in the home amen that actually binds the family together amen will there be things that come in and try and destroy the home absolutely but the love of God should so rule there should be an atmosphere amen that when we pray God should come down that our children should not our spouses should not there should be God should come to who's with me this this is not crazy talk this is reality we're the priest head of our home is priests and amen we should be able to pray in such a way that God just comes down amen that it takes away all the things that the devil tries to bring into our lives Hallelujah husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it amen well lot of people that's totally out of the question you mean give over my life you mean sacrifice my hobbies sacrifice what I want to do my me time oh boy well then they can't agree with the scripture should I put the picture of Jesus there again it's a religious spirit no I'm the head they have to do what I say no you've got to give yourself you got to love husbands must love their wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it amen you see and then also see so ought we just go down to verse 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth us cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones like telling the telling um some brothers here in the Solomons you know it's not like you ever who's ever you know put a you know hit a nail into the wall and you hit your thumb and you start abusing your hand and arm because it's stupid I've never seen anyone do that I've never seen anyone drop the hammer and just start abusing their hand say you stupid hand you stupid hand you're useless how do you no why is that because they realize they the hand is part of them yeah they are one there's not a connection line it just all merges and it should be the same thing with our spouses amen amen amen you realize you are one amen hello we just went segwaying but hey let's enjoy the segue amen this is how it should be we should never be angry at them like they no we're part of each other just like even the body of Christ hello we just extend extended the family line of it here we go but we're all by one Spirit we're baptized into one body amen amen so why get you know yes so but that's how some people and the people over there got it they laughed you know cuz sometimes they people just fly off the handle you woman you listen Len here you're part of each other amen you need a revelation amen thank you Lord amen amen praise the Lord now but how can you be part of him and then deny him how can I deny my hand being my hand if I do there's something mentally wrong with me and how can I if there is something mentally wrong with me deny that's my hand deny that's my foot there is something spiritually wrong with the believer that denies any word that God ever said and promised there is something spiritually wrong with that so-called believer you can't deny one letter of him because you have become part of the same you are part of him because you're baptized into him by the Holy Spirit has brought you into the body of Jesus Christ what a beautiful thing amen so just in truth like a husband can't deny a wife and the other way around they're part of the same one body amen you can't deny the word if you say you're part of it amen you can't say yes but that's for another age amen that Spirit still Creeps in here am me we say yes it was once upon a time but no it's you know that's history no the days of Miracles has not passed we have been restored to the book of Acts Church before it fell amen before it said that Pharisees said th Believers came in and tried to bring in former former things into the church no we have gone past that back to a back to a book of Acts before that church ever fell amen but you see now people say well we need to we need to get the get the mechanics and the Dynamics together then God God will finally move I'll say that's already here because we believe the whole thing because some people they will quench the spirit they don't want the Holy Ghost to move at all even in message circles but I say that no we need the mechanics and we need the Dynamics amen like brother Brown would say about how there's the fundamentalist this is why I was thinking about how you know people say that we are Baptists but then you know we're between Baptist and Pentecostals I thought no that's not right we believe the whole Bible am mean so he says in my travels I find two classes of people I see one of them fundamentals positionally they know by the mechanics that they are Sons they are to be sons and daughters in God and I said the next one I find is the Pentecostals they have with the baptism of the Holy Spirit but I said the fundamentals positioning know where they're at but they don't have any faith in the word and the Pentecostal have got a lot of faith but don't know where um who they are I said it's like a man who had money in the bank and could not write a check and one could write a check but had no money in the bank if you could just get them together a lot of people put that in the future it's already here amen I'm looking at people that have got money in the bank and checkbook authority to to spend it amen Amy says well what makes them act like that it's letting off the steam I said I don't think that would have have to be necessary I said but they've got to give vent somewhere I said now if we could just take all the Steam and could know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of God would start moving on there is where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics in other words only part of the word right back all Dynamics and no mechanics see we've got to put it together we've got uh We've Got The Power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine I say we have been restored back to the true word of God I mean so we' got the best fuel to put in the tank amen the spark plugs are firing amen the cylinders are working amen remember when brother Braham left he did not leave a gospel that could not be manifested that's right I mean he did not leave a gospel that had to be fixed it had to be tampered with it had to be edited or whatever no it was delivered how God wanted to be delivered amen and he put a faith in it people to receive it how it was delivered and that Faith came in to manifest what was preached amen so we don't just have the word and no Spirit right we are not void of the Holy Ghost which it's just dry sermons and dry worship time and dry after services and God doesn't move we are not void of the spirit amen I believe he can move more though don't get me wrong I wanted more Hallelujah I want way more than what we have amen but we're not void of the spirit and neither are we void of the word amen amen we have both that's right Hallelujah so we have been now we have been restored back the mechanics and the Dynamics are here and the reason I can say that is because we believe the whole word of God we don't just believe in gifts we believe in The Giver amen we don't just believe in well you've got to dress a holy way and church and all these things no we believe in that and the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost I mean we don't just believe in you know making a making a confession of faith and giving a sinner prayer that's not even really part of the word right and it's good to start there but don't stay there amen we you we don't just believe like Luther Luther saw the pillar of fire begin to move out of the Dark Ages he read in the Bible that just shall live by faith now the challenge would have been for you and I because there the trail of the Holy Ghost coming through a restoration would you have joined Luther or would have you stayed in the Catholic Church what would you have done amen when he preached that J shall live by faith and a Reformation started am me what would you do because that was the word being restored amen and then Wesley came along and and he preached that just shall live by faith his heart actually got ignited because he read or heard being read uh uh um Martin Luther's um writings on the book of Romans he said his heart was strangely warmed at that time he is already an Anglican priest but he miserably failed in America as a missionary he went back to England and but but his but his life was transformed because he heard that uh being read and he didn't just believe in the just shall live by faith he believed no we should live a holy life God was now restoring now the challenge would have been for us would you stay in the Lutheran Church or the Anglican church or you Joy join this real short fellow redheaded man preached in The Meadows and even from his father's grave and different places would you join those people amen what would you have done absolutely amen I yeah I've seen in my family history that you're with the name gloin that the first one who put the ear on the end was actually a Methodist circuit preacher right after Wesley died now that's neat history but it's not going help me none if I don't know the same God he knew amen but you see what would we have done would we have joined wisley and been made fun of and all these things or would we stayed in the past amen and then the Pentecostals came along so I'm skipping a few with a pillar of fire move but then the Pentecostals came there's a cry for the restoration of the gifts amen and they were called trash and outwash and Fanatics and all these things what would you have done they had church services that happened more than once where people while they're having church people actually shot through the the windows at them and the bullets as the woman was singing the spirit and dancing the bullets just fell off their dresses didn't even hurt them none but people were trying to disrupt their services like that would you have gone to church in that era like that oh yeah prise Lord your attitude now be attitude then amen but see the pillar of fire was moving but you see now see but that wasn't the end of it they thought they were fully restored but the word hadn't been restored am me then of course God sent God sent brother Bram to fulfill Malachi 4 to turn the of the children back to the fathers amen that's what the ministry was sent to do and he also says that as the days of Noah and the days of lot you a lot of people can say yes we're living in a sodomite age again right everyone around the world says that doesn't matter you know they can agree doesn't matter what religion they're part of but then when you come down even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed you see who is the son of man Jesus Christ amen so so anyone can say yes the world's in this we said no hold on in this day this should happen and you can say look it has happened amen we know brother Brown's Ministry initiated the post World War II healing Revival that swept the world but see all that was done now to to gather a people for the word to be restored now what would you have done in that day would you have been caught up in just the healings or you have followed the pillar of fire as the Lord revealed himself see a lot of people say if only I lived 50 years ago and 60 years ago back then and they talk about what God did back then but what about now about now what about now because he's still the Jehovah of Miracles he still sets the captives free he still casts out Devils I can say I've seen more God do more things in these four walls that I have on the mission field I've seen him do a lot of things over there why cuz he's the same today amen his promises are true but you see we must become one with the word in this day amen we got to see the pillar of fire move it's not just a photograph anymore see that photograph was taken to document God was there it's not even about the man brother Braham said I was just there when my when his photo was taken but you see that same Pillar of Fire is still here in 2024 amen amen I trust you're not getting too bored here now we we're going to we're going to wind up here a little bit amen but you see the problem is of this age I don't have the full thing you read in Revelations 3 about the age of lady oia yeah Jesus says behold I stand at the door and knock you see so what ises he doing he's not just knocking at people's hearts to come in actually what it means he's on the outside of the church world yeah amen he's on the outside of the church world trying to get back in why they've kicked him out because they've received Creeds and dogmas of man and you see that's why that's why the way we follow the whole word of God is considered heresy because he's not in the churches anymore he's been kicked out he's been evicted but you see as as many uh if any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come into him and we s with him and he with me amen so if you hear his voice and I I I pray to God you hear his voice don't hear my voice hear his voice and you open your hearts door and say Lord come in dwell with me amen then what happens you'll have communion one with another you and God Amen so you see he's on the outside trying to get back in yeah amen but why has he gone this way is because people have just taken part of the word and say this is it and this has always been Satan's plan down Through the Ages it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know all Jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that they gave for this day then that was applied to another age that's all he has to do he is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all for you cannot take one word away from it and add or add one word one word to it that's what he does and that's why people will cabbage down on the quote that says the Holy Ghost comes without sensation they say well people don't receive the Holy Ghost like did back then and brother says the word can only bring forth screaming hollering acts 238 young come on now I mean he says that in the choosing of the Bride or one of those messages but you see now but people fail to take the rest of that quote that says but it's the word of God Jesus Christ fulfilling himself in the life amen so the sensation may be different but what's he doing in your life now amen is he living he's doing his works now through your life amen I trust that's okay amen yes everyone's testimony is different but you got to see there's got to be a definite something's got to happen to you amen we can look back and say from that point on something happened I'm a different person amen my life has changed you see there were there were arguments back in his day saying you know people would debate with them you're trying to you're trying to inject into this age an Apostolic Doctrine the apostolic age ceased with the apostles that's what people were saying so in other words they saying yes that happened but it was back there it doesn't apply today so basically what they're saying is we don't believe that part of the word is actually relevant we don't believe that part but brother BR believe the the whole word like we do like the Apostle Paul did amen he says he says I asked him well do you believe believe the word he said yes I said Revelations 2218 says whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it not just two words one word take one word out I said then I can tell you where the apostolic age was given the apostolic blessing was given to the church now you tell me where God taken it out of the church by the word you can't do it it's not there I said now remember that that Peter on the day of Pentecost he was the introducer of the apostolic age he told all of them to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so we believe the whole word of God Amen we don't just believe portion amen I agree Hallelujah you see God moves right on amen that's why that's why people even you know maybe I'm just got to wind up with this I know this is very you say well I'm telling you what we believe we believe the whole word of God Amen okay we don't just believe portion we believe the entire Bible amen the not just not just bits that suit not just bits that are are culturally acceptable we believe the whole word I mean you see the Bible promised that this gospel would just become so each day just like the day of Luther he taught justification it come the minority when he come into the wisley and Methodist age through sanctification then when they settled down to a church and there was that was all there was to it God raised up Pentecost now it's got to the place that Pentecost is becoming formal and indifferent God moves right on that's he won't stop at all he goes right on the children of Israel followed a pillar of fire and every time that fire stopped they stopped with it and if they didn't move they were left in the wilderness they had to move where the fire moved that's the way God Church does always does it moves with the fire when Martin Luther saw the fire First Reformation he came out of the Catholic church he built his denomination under it the fire moved into sanctification he was um already organized under that and couldn't do it uh couldn't go go any further Methodist took it they organized under that they couldn't go no further Pentecost came and took it from them now if we don't watch the fire will move right on again let's stay under the fire worship under the fire Worship in the power of the spirit believing God's word laying aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us that's what we're going to do we say where's the fire moving on now this is going to take us all the way into a Rapture amen amen amen this is the final voice to the final age but you see we can't just organize it and say well this is just a systematic way of believing and that's it walk with God Amen take the whole word of God Amen don't just take the things that you like take the whole word surrender to the whole word of God and watch him fulfill that word in your life yes sir so what do we believe the whole word of God Amen so let's have the musicians please thank you Lord this morning maybe I'll pick this up in a part two another time but I think I been saying that often but you [Applause] see amen thank you Lord the whole thing amen let's stand shall we this morning so where would you be I'm just going to ask you the question as we before we sing this song where would you be if you were back in history would you be a real believer walking where God was or would you be the scoff or the indifferent what your attitude is now is would be attitude back then I pray that we're all we're all the real believer that's walking right with God doesn't matter what the opposition is the trouble whatever it is we're walking on right
