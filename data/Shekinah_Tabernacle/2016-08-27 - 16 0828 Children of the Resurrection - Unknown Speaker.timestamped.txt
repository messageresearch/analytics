[48:10] Elana here with us God bless you it's
[48:12] always great to have you down here
[48:19] amen amen if you got your Bibles
[48:23] handy if you like to turn with me
[48:26] to Luke Chapter
[48:33] 20 and then we're going to go to Isaiah
[48:35] chapter
[48:54] 1
[48:59] now we go to verse
[49:00] 34 I'm not uh I'm not going
[49:04] into not going into marriage and divorce
[49:06] today but um I just want to take
[49:09] a especially the uh the last three
[49:13] verses but um Jesus has asked a question
[49:18] about who will people marry if they
[49:20] marry more than one time here and you
[49:22] know in heaven and so on but I I don't
[49:24] want to go into that but I just want
[49:26] to I just want to go for a context
[49:29] really from from verse 36 but we want to
[49:31] read from verse 34 and Jesus answered
[49:33] and said unto them the children of this
[49:35] world marry and are given a marriage but
[49:38] they which shall be accounted worthy to
[49:40] obtain the world that world speaking of
[49:43] of this next World the Heaven and the
[49:45] resurrection from the dead neither marry
[49:47] nor are given a marriage neither can
[49:49] they die anymore for they equal unto the
[49:52] angels and are the children of God
[49:56] being the children of the Resurrection
[49:59] okay this is where I want to get my
[50:00] thought from so they are the children of
[50:03] God being the children of the
[50:06] Resurrection now that the dead are
[50:08] raised even Moses showed at the Bush
[50:11] when he called the Lord the god of
[50:13] Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god
[50:14] of Jacob for he is not the god of the
[50:17] dead but of the living for all live un
[50:21] him and now we want to go to Isaiah
[50:24] chapter 1
[50:26] there's probably very very very much two
[50:30] contrasting uh scriptures but I trust
[50:35] the Lord will put it
[50:40] together now this is let's just uh let's
[50:44] just read from from verse two so this is
[50:48] the vision of Isaiah's Mighty prophet of
[50:50] God sent to the children of God after
[50:53] the flesh he says we'll just read from
[50:55] verse two he o heavens and give ear o
[50:57] Earth for the Lord has spoken I have
[51:01] nourished and brought up children and
[51:03] they have rebelled against me the ox
[51:06] knoweth his owner and the ass his
[51:09] master's crib but Israel does not know
[51:14] my people does not
[51:16] consider amen may the Lord bless his
[51:18] word you may be seated that may seem
[51:21] like a very
[51:22] strange uh very strange to piece of
[51:25] scripture but I want
[51:29] to I want to try and tie them together
[51:31] now Isaiah chapter 1 you know we read we
[51:35] read there in Luke Chapter 20 and I want
[51:36] to speak about the children of the
[51:38] resurrection and we know Jesus is
[51:41] speaking about those who have H have
[51:43] have gone on before you know neither
[51:46] given a marriage or marry in heaven but
[51:50] they're the children of God being the
[51:52] children of the Resurrection so if
[51:54] you're a child of of the Resurrection
[51:56] you're a child of God
[51:59] yeah and so a child knows who its
[52:03] parents are amen I know there's probably
[52:06] very I'll probably go very slow but I
[52:07] really want you to grasp something here
[52:09] a
[52:10] child unless they've been put in an
[52:12] orphanage when they're a baby they know
[52:15] who their parents are and even children
[52:18] in in orphanages if they really want to
[52:21] they can find their biological parents
[52:23] and you hear many stories of it be
[52:25] decades down the road but they but they
[52:28] and and even if their parents have
[52:29] passed on they they they they find out
[52:32] who they were where they lived and you
[52:33] know everything about them so but then
[52:36] you see even but Israel see it's such a
[52:38] contrast here children of God being the
[52:41] children of the Resurrection but here we
[52:43] have here we have Isaiah and he is sent
[52:46] to Israel and Israel after the natural
[52:49] natural lineage were the children of
[52:52] Abraham being the children of God yeah
[52:55] but you see he says that even and and
[52:58] and it's such a such a rebuke but you
[53:01] see here that that the Lord says you
[53:03] know I've nourished and brought up
[53:04] children so I've brought up a family but
[53:07] they have rebelled against
[53:09] me and God is God is saying that the
[53:12] like even even animals like an ox you
[53:15] know you know a an ox knows its owner
[53:19] you know a pet or you even even even
[53:21] farm animals as he's saying they know
[53:23] who their owner is they know who's in
[53:26] control they know who's the head of the
[53:28] farm or the family or whatever more and
[53:31] even even a an ass which is just a
[53:33] donkey it knows its Master's crib so it
[53:36] knows where it lives and you know knows
[53:38] who its Master is knows the that feeds
[53:41] it but you know but he says but Israel
[53:44] doesn't know these things so even even
[53:47] the animals knew who who who their
[53:50] Master is but he said the people of God
[53:52] do not even know who owns them who looks
[53:56] after them who keeps them in the land
[53:58] who reveals himself to them who makes
[54:00] himself known they didn't know who these
[54:02] they don't know who this God was but yet
[54:05] they had the temple they had the Books
[54:08] of Moses they had the prophets they had
[54:11] all the prophecies they had the word
[54:14] they had the pure word written word but
[54:16] yet they didn't even know who where they
[54:18] came from and where they going
[54:20] incredible if you think about it you
[54:22] know and they didn't even it says it
[54:24] says but Israel does not
[54:26] know and my people do not even consider
[54:29] so they don't they he's saying that they
[54:31] don't even sit down for a second and and
[54:33] consider who is our God who brought us
[54:36] from Egypt into this place who is the
[54:38] one that keeps us in the promised land
[54:40] who is the one that spoke to Moses you
[54:42] know who is this God of you know the god
[54:44] of our fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[54:47] they weren't even considering these
[54:48] things but yet God but notice now God
[54:52] doesn't want to leave them in that state
[54:55] but God sends a prophet now to try and
[54:58] to try and get the people's attention
[55:00] that the people through the ministry of
[55:02] Isaiah they' say My Father which art in
[55:05] heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[55:07] come thy will be done on Earth as it is
[55:09] in heaven so you know that's the reason
[55:11] why God sent Isaiah is because the
[55:13] people had gone sideways in their walk
[55:15] with God and they just got caught up in
[55:18] what the Nations around them were doing
[55:20] and what everything was going on and
[55:23] they were just stuck in this way they
[55:25] forgot who their parents were now if you
[55:28] know who your parents are if you know
[55:31] them you know their
[55:33] qualities amen even as you get older you
[55:36] know they weaknesses but then you
[55:37] realize they're human amen and that's
[55:40] not necessarily A Bad Thing amen because
[55:42] you know that they can understand what
[55:44] you're going through amen because they
[55:46] face the same things and so and so the
[55:50] people they do not by forgetting by
[55:53] forgetting who their God was now they
[55:55] begin to lean upon politics natural
[55:58] ability how we can hold this Kingdom
[56:01] together amen he following me because
[56:04] this is not an Isaiah's day here we are
[56:06] in
[56:07] 2016 the world the world you know the
[56:11] animals they know who their Master is
[56:13] you know you can you can take the
[56:15] scripture you can put it even into the
[56:17] you know you know even this day if you
[56:19] know who your parents are you know your
[56:22] your your family name you know the
[56:25] reputation of the family you know what
[56:27] the attributes are in the family oh my
[56:29] forbear did this and he did this and she
[56:31] did this and she was like this and you
[56:33] can see the characteristics come down
[56:35] and you know who where you're from amen
[56:39] I just just just just just bear with me
[56:41] a little bit okay but then if you don't
[56:44] know those things then you'll just
[56:47] you'll just move with the Winds of the
[56:50] society that you're in amen you won't
[56:54] have have any pride in who you really
[56:56] are you just say well this is where I am
[56:58] and these are my parents and you know
[57:00] well this is the society and your whole
[57:02] life will be dictated to by whichever
[57:05] current you know whichever way the
[57:06] current of life is
[57:08] going why are you like this we everyone
[57:10] El was like this why do you do this
[57:12] everyone else does this why do you think
[57:13] this everyone else thinks this amen but
[57:17] if but if you know who your parents are
[57:18] say well I love my mom and dad and they
[57:21] and they've tried to teach us the right
[57:23] way and I want to I want to honor them
[57:26] because I love them I'm talking about
[57:28] natural family but you you apply it to
[57:29] the spiritual and you say well I don't
[57:32] really want to even though because I'm
[57:34] in this body there's something my flesh
[57:35] may want to do it but there's something
[57:37] in me says that's not
[57:39] me amen that's why there's such a
[57:42] temptation to go with the crowd but
[57:44] we're not called to go with the
[57:46] crowd amen you know someone made a very
[57:48] crude statement he said a dead fish
[57:52] never swims against the current it just
[57:54] goes with the current but a life fish
[57:56] can swim against the current amen and
[57:59] we're not called to just float with the
[58:01] current amen we're not called to float
[58:03] with this world Jesus said Jesus said I
[58:06] don't I don't want to take you from the
[58:07] world but I want to keep you in this
[58:09] world I mean I want to keep you in this
[58:11] world and if you can recognize that
[58:13] you're a child of the Resurrection I'm a
[58:16] son or daughter of God Amen you'll
[58:19] you'll walk different you'll talk
[58:21] different you'll be different not
[58:24] because you Tred make yourself different
[58:26] but you recognize there's a life in you
[58:28] that makes you live a different kind of
[58:30] life and so now they forgot all about
[58:33] what they were and who they really were
[58:36] because God they had it they had now we
[58:39] know they didn't have Bibles like this
[58:41] they had Scrolls that would have been in
[58:42] Hebrew but they could have gone back to
[58:45] Exodus and they could have read about
[58:46] how God said if you keep my word I you
[58:49] I'll make you a royal priesthood a holy
[58:51] nation they could have read that if they
[58:54] knew who who their God was and if they
[58:57] if they remembered who he was they would
[58:59] have said this is what we want to be
[59:01] because our God said if we if we keep
[59:03] his word then he'll do this for us but
[59:05] they had
[59:06] forgotten they had the very people who
[59:08] should have remembered who God was
[59:10] forgot him amen and it's the same thing
[59:14] today Every Nation that's why it's so
[59:16] amazing you know people try and attack
[59:18] the Bible they say well everyone has a
[59:20] flood you a flood myth of a great flood
[59:23] and a boat being built and you know and
[59:26] he well they you you know people say
[59:28] well they just took that and they put it
[59:30] in the Bible no the reason that flood
[59:32] myth is into virtually every nation
[59:34] under Heaven is because it
[59:36] happened amen but what happens now is
[59:39] that the devil wants to twist the word
[59:41] because remember he wants to make us
[59:43] forget who we really who we really are
[59:46] amen and if he can take if he can take
[59:49] something like you know if he can just
[59:50] take the word and and then he can just
[59:52] twist it and say now this is just a
[59:54] local myth then you really the the
[59:57] whatever language or Nation it is they
[59:59] forget where they're really from amen
[1:00:02] and it's the same thing when when when
[1:00:05] people look at the word of God they say
[1:00:07] well it's just a western religion this
[1:00:09] has never been a western religion this
[1:00:12] is a middle eastern religion and it's
[1:00:13] not just Middle Eastern in origin but
[1:00:15] it's for all every tribe Kindred nation
[1:00:17] and tongue amen it's not it's not a skin
[1:00:20] color thing people want to have a debate
[1:00:22] with Jesus white or black it doesn't
[1:00:24] doesn't matter what he was Paul said it
[1:00:26] was the blood of God that was shed on
[1:00:28] Calvary amen he wasn't a juror a gentile
[1:00:30] if he was we're lost he was God in flesh
[1:00:34] so it doesn't matter I'm I'm not worried
[1:00:35] what he looked like all I know is the
[1:00:37] Bible tells me he wasn't a big handsome
[1:00:39] looking guy it says when we saw him
[1:00:41] there was nothing in him that we' desire
[1:00:43] him am mean but there was a life in him
[1:00:46] am mean he was the Lamb of God who was
[1:00:48] going to purchase Redemption amen and he
[1:00:51] wasn't afraid to pay the price amen he
[1:00:53] didn't weigh up the balance can I do it
[1:00:55] can I do it he knew he could do it amen
[1:00:57] he knew he could shed his life upon the
[1:01:00] Earth Amen to redeem you Hallelujah
[1:01:03] because he wanted to make the people but
[1:01:06] in the days of Isaiah they were walking
[1:01:07] in darkness there was no Revival there's
[1:01:10] no National Awakening to who they really
[1:01:12] were because if they really W If there
[1:01:15] really was an Awakening they wouldn't
[1:01:18] they would have cleaved to the Lord and
[1:01:20] they would have recognized all our
[1:01:22] problems could be solved if we just
[1:01:23] turned to God
[1:01:25] I mean doesn't matter what the Assyrians
[1:01:26] are doing what the Babylonians and the
[1:01:28] Egyptians and whoever more whatever
[1:01:30] they're doing we just need to cleave to
[1:01:32] God Amen and then he would have taken
[1:01:34] care of it because they could have just
[1:01:36] read
[1:01:37] testimonies they could have gone to the
[1:01:39] Book of Judges could have read Gideon
[1:01:42] read about barck and and Deborah and you
[1:01:44] know all the stories all the way down
[1:01:45] they could recognize hey if we just turn
[1:01:47] to this God that we've just heard about
[1:01:49] he'll become real to us and he can take
[1:01:51] care of
[1:01:52] everything Hallelujah
[1:01:57] now the
[1:01:59] word I want to take
[1:02:03] this you know we we live in a day and
[1:02:06] hour where the people of God know who
[1:02:08] they are amen amen we know who we are in
[1:02:11] the word am amen it's not a mental
[1:02:14] understanding or I've I've you I've done
[1:02:17] a seven step course to become a
[1:02:20] Christian but God becomes real amen amen
[1:02:24] and you go from just being a being a
[1:02:26] child of the Dust remember a son of Adam
[1:02:29] thust thou art thust thou shall return
[1:02:32] and so we go from being a son of the
[1:02:35] Dust Adam means dust amen we go from
[1:02:38] that from a child of dust to a child of
[1:02:41] the
[1:02:43] Resurrection amen because a you know we
[1:02:46] know dust and I know I've talked about
[1:02:48] these things you know in some ways
[1:02:49] before but dust it just goes with the
[1:02:51] wind whichever way the wind's glowing
[1:02:54] there goes the dust oh this is the
[1:02:56] popular fashion of the day and there you
[1:02:58] are oh now we're all watching these
[1:03:00] things and here we are have you watched
[1:03:01] Game of Thrones never watch the episode
[1:03:03] but if you're son of the Dust here we go
[1:03:06] amen oh cuz it's cool who says it's
[1:03:09] cool amen oh everyone's doing it does
[1:03:12] that mean it's
[1:03:13] right
[1:03:15] amen Walking with God is not a democracy
[1:03:18] it never has been a democracy it's
[1:03:20] always been the Lord's despised few
[1:03:25] amen Moses Moses wasn't all that well
[1:03:28] liked even though he took the people up
[1:03:30] to
[1:03:30] Jordan amen and all the prophets which
[1:03:33] one did they receive and have a glorious
[1:03:35] time not a single one they were sorn
[1:03:38] aund they were rejected they were thrown
[1:03:40] in prison all manner of things happen to
[1:03:43] them and even Jesus now you look you
[1:03:45] look Jesus all he had he was a very God
[1:03:48] God was made flesh and walked Among Us
[1:03:52] and here he was and and he and he only
[1:03:55] ended up with you it says in the
[1:03:57] scripture Paul says that after his
[1:03:58] resurrection he revealed himself to 500
[1:04:01] people at once but only 120 of them were
[1:04:04] in the upper
[1:04:05] room amen oh that's not a very
[1:04:08] successful Ministry it it was exactly as
[1:04:11] successful as he wanted it to be and he
[1:04:14] knew he was who was going to be there he
[1:04:15] wasn't worried about numbers amen even
[1:04:18] even when he preached a service in John
[1:04:21] chapter 6 he says unless you eat my
[1:04:23] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:04:25] life in you and then the fundamentals
[1:04:28] day would have thought Moses said You
[1:04:30] shall not do that so therefore he's just
[1:04:33] contradicted the scripture he didn't
[1:04:35] contradict the scripture they didn't
[1:04:37] understand what he was saying and then
[1:04:39] there was 5,000 then after one sermon he
[1:04:42] had
[1:04:43] 12 and then he doesn't and he doesn't
[1:04:45] chase after them saying no please come
[1:04:47] back I'll make myself clear he actually
[1:04:49] says to the disciples will you go as
[1:04:52] well and then and Peter says well to
[1:04:55] whom shall we go you alone have the
[1:04:57] words of eternal life but notice his
[1:04:59] response he doesn't say oh I'm so glad
[1:05:01] you caught it he says don't you know
[1:05:04] I've chosen you one of you a devil he
[1:05:06] just leaves it kind of hanging he knows
[1:05:08] who's going to be a child of the
[1:05:10] Resurrection you see but that's all he
[1:05:12] really had in his day John didn't have a
[1:05:14] great big group he was he was the one to
[1:05:16] forun the first coming of God God was
[1:05:19] going to become flesh born born of Mary
[1:05:22] born into the human race as a man but a
[1:05:24] God man and he was the one to introduce
[1:05:27] him he only had a small
[1:05:29] group amen and he even got discourage
[1:05:32] when he's there in prison and his eagle
[1:05:34] eyes brother BR says clouded over you
[1:05:37] know and he and he say to some of his
[1:05:38] some of his disciples go ask him is he
[1:05:41] really the one but when he was standing
[1:05:43] there on the banks of the Jordan he says
[1:05:45] he says he's even standing among you now
[1:05:47] he so he was so gripped and then he saw
[1:05:49] the vision you know you of the of the
[1:05:52] spirit of God descending upon him and
[1:05:54] and abiding upon him and he pointed him
[1:05:55] out in the crowd says here comes the
[1:05:57] Lamb of God to take away the sin of the
[1:05:59] world Amen so he and and he stood
[1:06:02] against all the religions in that day
[1:06:04] but then at the end of his ministry he
[1:06:06] says well is this really it and then
[1:06:09] now the one who is the resurrection and
[1:06:11] the life tells his disciples stay around
[1:06:15] a little bit we're going to have
[1:06:16] church amen and then go tell John what
[1:06:20] you
[1:06:20] see amen and then and then when they
[1:06:23] took the testimony back he said praise
[1:06:25] God I've done my
[1:06:26] job amen he didn't have a big they
[1:06:29] didn't have a big group the church the
[1:06:31] the real Believers have never been
[1:06:33] accepted in every part of
[1:06:36] society amen you see Martin Luther was
[1:06:39] on the run in in in Germany and Europe
[1:06:43] amen have you read church
[1:06:46] history Paul Paul was Paul was beaten
[1:06:49] stoned ran from City to City all you
[1:06:52] know they were persecuted they were
[1:06:55] Afflicted amen you take Luther was the
[1:06:58] same way
[1:07:00] Wesley you know wisley he had to use
[1:07:03] just open air he had to have open air
[1:07:05] meetings he even used his father's grave
[1:07:07] many times as a
[1:07:08] Pulpit amen because the churches closed
[1:07:11] their doors they say we'll not have this
[1:07:13] man preaching our churches anymore he
[1:07:15] was a church aged messenger bringing the
[1:07:17] Word of Life to a
[1:07:18] nation was he accepted did they say oh
[1:07:21] come on in I'm so glad you're here
[1:07:23] praise God we're going to have no away
[1:07:25] with this
[1:07:26] guy amen every single move of God has
[1:07:30] been has been rejected and it's been the
[1:07:33] people have been persecuted you know you
[1:07:35] can't wait oh maybe one day this message
[1:07:38] will become popular it'll never become
[1:07:40] popular because the message down Through
[1:07:42] the Ages has never been
[1:07:44] popular
[1:07:46] amen but to those who receive
[1:07:49] it it gives them power to become the
[1:07:52] Sons and Daughters of God yes amen it
[1:07:54] causes the resurrection to come into
[1:07:57] them Hallelujah and they begin to
[1:08:01] realize they begin to realize who their
[1:08:04] father is amen the very problem that
[1:08:08] that God was speaking to Isaiah about
[1:08:11] the ones who know their God Amen they
[1:08:14] they are not stumbling around in
[1:08:16] darkness like Israel
[1:08:18] was are you are you following me amen
[1:08:22] now I just want to let's just go to
[1:08:25] Romans chapter
[1:08:39] 8 it says Romans chapter 8 and we'll
[1:08:42] read from verse
[1:08:49] 14 now it says
[1:08:51] here for as many are as is led by the
[1:08:54] spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:08:57] God for ye have not received the spirit
[1:09:00] of bondage again to
[1:09:02] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[1:09:05] adoption whereby you cry Abba
[1:09:08] Father now I just want to stop right
[1:09:12] there you see believers who have gone
[1:09:14] on you know every every Christian says
[1:09:19] they're not scared to die yeah but it's
[1:09:22] when death begins to take grip is really
[1:09:25] the proof of the pudding are they scared
[1:09:28] or are they scared are they scared or
[1:09:30] are they not scared you know there was
[1:09:33] there was a case brother brah was
[1:09:35] talking about of a of a of a lady who
[1:09:39] who went to the church a little bit but
[1:09:40] then left and went to another church and
[1:09:43] she was she was
[1:09:45] dying and she was all calm and happy but
[1:09:48] then when when when life was beginning
[1:09:50] to leave her she she came into shock
[1:09:54] and she realized she was lost and she
[1:09:57] began to cry out I'm lost I'm lost and
[1:09:59] and and she looked at the minister says
[1:10:01] you deceiver of man you've deceived me
[1:10:03] now I'm lost who's a Methodist minister
[1:10:04] or somewh some some denomination and she
[1:10:07] cried out go get that go get that
[1:10:09] preacher down there from that other
[1:10:10] Church speaking of brother Brandon but
[1:10:13] it was but but then the minister said to
[1:10:14] the doctor just just give her a hypo to
[1:10:16] calm her down so injected some something
[1:10:20] into her and then she fell asleep and
[1:10:22] she was gone
[1:10:24] but she realized now I'm not saying that
[1:10:26] to shock you but I'm saying that that
[1:10:29] there's a
[1:10:30] realization you know the first thing
[1:10:32] everyone will know when they pass to the
[1:10:34] next side is there's a God and his name
[1:10:36] is Jesus Christ that's the first thing
[1:10:38] everyone will know amen and but you see
[1:10:41] she thought she was fine but then when
[1:10:43] life was leaving her the real her her
[1:10:46] real State came into
[1:10:47] being amen but then those who have
[1:10:50] really met the Lord not you know not
[1:10:53] just being caught up in a church oh we
[1:10:55] have church and this is what we do but
[1:10:57] those who really know him I mean you got
[1:10:59] to I pray to God you I was singing this
[1:11:01] the other day I'm glad God found me
[1:11:04] before the church
[1:11:06] did amen and I pray even that's the same
[1:11:09] with with with you that God finds you
[1:11:11] before you get caught up and now we have
[1:11:13] church and we have services and this is
[1:11:15] what we do and that's just a way of life
[1:11:17] this is not some way of life amen it's
[1:11:20] it's you meet God personally and you
[1:11:23] know him the power of his
[1:11:25] resurrection amen but then there's
[1:11:27] others and I'll take I'll take
[1:11:29] Christine's Auntie had was dying of a
[1:11:32] brain tumor there in Switzerland
[1:11:34] Christine went over to look after her
[1:11:36] and for about three months and she was
[1:11:41] she was on death's St not even a
[1:11:42] Christian that's is how simple it
[1:11:45] is and she would see dark things move in
[1:11:48] the
[1:11:49] room why because she was slipping from
[1:11:52] this world into the next world but where
[1:11:55] she was going was going down amen but
[1:11:58] the Lord was merciful to her and
[1:12:00] Christine talked to her and prayed with
[1:12:02] her and she gave her life gave her life
[1:12:05] over accepted what Jesus Jesus Paid It
[1:12:08] All am mean it's not about jumping
[1:12:10] through a whole bunch of Hoops you just
[1:12:11] got to give your life over and then
[1:12:13] after that she just saw beautiful big
[1:12:15] birds Just Like Paradise was there amen
[1:12:19] I can see your reflection in the window
[1:12:21] hey isn't that right honey amen
[1:12:24] and so just that simple thing God came
[1:12:28] into the room she accepted what he did
[1:12:31] for her and then in going from and then
[1:12:33] after that she wasn't
[1:12:35] scared amen so I was saying the proof of
[1:12:38] the pudding is when you know when it's
[1:12:41] really life is leaving where you going
[1:12:42] to go and she knew she was going to a
[1:12:44] better place hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:12:47] that's how simple it
[1:12:48] was you see
[1:12:51] so it is the now and and that's why we
[1:12:54] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:12:57] again to fear because it always used to
[1:12:59] be and man still does it with religion
[1:13:02] unless you tow the line you're
[1:13:04] lost amen and they put a fear upon
[1:13:07] people it's not about a fear it should
[1:13:09] be a love I'm not a Christian because
[1:13:11] I'm scared I'm going to go to
[1:13:13] hell amen I I'm a Christian because I
[1:13:16] love him and that's it amen that's why
[1:13:20] we have not and and and if he has made
[1:13:22] himself real to me
[1:13:23] and he's brought me thus far as he
[1:13:26] carried you am mean if he's carried you
[1:13:28] thus far he's not going to drop you in
[1:13:30] the very crucial moment when when you
[1:13:33] really need him and that's why I don't
[1:13:35] have a
[1:13:36] fear amen because I've I've given my
[1:13:39] life into his hands and remember God is
[1:13:42] a gentleman and I said this on Wednesday
[1:13:45] but God does not take things from us you
[1:13:48] know it's not like and I just use this
[1:13:50] crude expression this is just how it
[1:13:51] came to me God is Not like someone who
[1:13:54] mugs someone you know what a Mugger is
[1:13:56] Beats them up grabs their goods and runs
[1:13:58] away God doesn't mug you amen you have
[1:14:02] you CU some people say well I'll give
[1:14:05] this up or I'll surrender this after I
[1:14:06] meet him that's not how it works you
[1:14:09] have to give it to him and then he takes
[1:14:12] it from you cuz he's a gentleman he's
[1:14:15] not you know he's you know he's not a
[1:14:16] robber or a thief you have to actually
[1:14:19] say here you are Lord and then he takes
[1:14:21] it from you amen unless you're willing
[1:14:24] to do that then he'll let you hold on to
[1:14:27] it amen he doesn't you know it's
[1:14:31] man's it is not God that sends people to
[1:14:35] hell it is man sends
[1:14:38] himself amen because we have a free
[1:14:41] moral
[1:14:42] choice amen and we have the power to
[1:14:44] choose which way are we going to
[1:14:48] go and it's purely you say
[1:14:52] well what what about predestination I
[1:14:54] say this God knows who's going to end up
[1:14:56] where they're going to end up amen
[1:14:59] because if he didn't know he'd be God I
[1:15:01] mean I mean he wouldn't be
[1:15:02] God are you following me amen so it's
[1:15:05] actually Man's Free moral choice the
[1:15:08] power to choose but you must understand
[1:15:10] that your choice is governed by your
[1:15:13] nature amen that's why some people they
[1:15:17] choose and they end up doing horrible
[1:15:19] things amen but there's other people and
[1:15:22] and these two unconverted people one
[1:15:26] nature they can end up doing horrible
[1:15:27] things and the other person can have a
[1:15:30] nicer nature and do not so horrible
[1:15:33] things but unless God comes into that
[1:15:35] life they're both
[1:15:37] lost amen so it's not remember it's not
[1:15:40] a merited well I've done this I've done
[1:15:42] that therefore I earn you know this is
[1:15:45] not a you don't earn Heaven it's a free
[1:15:48] gift you have to choose just to accept
[1:15:51] it amen
[1:15:54] it's really that simple you just have to
[1:15:55] choose to accept
[1:15:58] it and so
[1:16:00] now that's why we have not received the
[1:16:03] Spirit uh we have not received the
[1:16:06] spirit of bondage against to fear so we
[1:16:08] have not received the spirit whereby we
[1:16:11] are in
[1:16:12] slavery
[1:16:14] amen but ye have received the spirit of
[1:16:18] adoption whereby you cry Abba Father so
[1:16:22] Paul is telling these Romans and he's
[1:16:24] telling you this morning he well God is
[1:16:27] rather he says if you received the
[1:16:29] spirit of God Amen you have not received
[1:16:32] the spirit of fear or bondage some
[1:16:34] slavery to the schemes of man or what
[1:16:37] other circumstance you may find you in
[1:16:39] or your past forget about your past amen
[1:16:42] if you've given it to God God doesn't
[1:16:44] remember it and God doesn't want you to
[1:16:47] remember it God doesn't want you to be a
[1:16:49] slave to maybe what even you did
[1:16:51] yesterday amen if you've given given it
[1:16:53] to him amen it says he he takes it he
[1:16:56] puts it in the sea of his
[1:16:58] forgetfulness what does that mean God
[1:17:00] has the we may remember but God has the
[1:17:03] ability to
[1:17:04] forget amen because God does not want
[1:17:08] you thinking he holds things against you
[1:17:12] amen because if if you think and you
[1:17:14] take this in a natural relationship if
[1:17:16] you think someone's holding something
[1:17:18] against you you can't have the
[1:17:19] relationship that you really ought to
[1:17:21] have amen
[1:17:23] because you got to deal with whatever
[1:17:25] the thing is that they're holding
[1:17:26] against you amen and it's up to the
[1:17:29] other person can they let it go or not
[1:17:32] if they can't let it go then there's
[1:17:34] always going to be a
[1:17:35] blockage amen there's always going to be
[1:17:37] a blockage well they wronged me the
[1:17:40] whole world wronged God Amen even even
[1:17:44] God in his Mercy in the Old Testament as
[1:17:46] we read there in Isaiah 1 the ox knows
[1:17:49] it Master the ass knows his master's
[1:17:51] crib but Israel doesn't even know they
[1:17:54] don't even
[1:17:55] consider and then but yet he sent
[1:17:58] Prophet after Prophet sign after sign am
[1:18:01] me to get their attention to get them to
[1:18:02] turn back to
[1:18:05] him and then he came to his own Jesus
[1:18:08] says he came to his own his own received
[1:18:10] him not amen but yet Jesus who was God
[1:18:15] in flesh he didn't hold it against hisra
[1:18:17] he said father forgive them they don't
[1:18:19] know what they're
[1:18:20] doing amen and if he can have that kind
[1:18:23] of and we're to be like
[1:18:25] Jesus amen are we not it's so easy oh to
[1:18:28] be like Jesus we it's so easy to sing it
[1:18:30] or say it but when the rubber hits the
[1:18:33] road and a challenge comes into life can
[1:18:36] you be like Jesus oh they wrong me will
[1:18:38] you not being like
[1:18:39] Jesus amen these people did me wrong and
[1:18:42] oh I'm going to deal with them that's
[1:18:44] not being like Jesus am amen because if
[1:18:47] you want to be like Jesus you just got
[1:18:48] to pray and just let it
[1:18:50] go amen how do you truly forgive
[1:18:53] you surrender the ability to hold it
[1:18:55] against people that's how you truly
[1:18:57] forgive and so God doesn't want you
[1:19:00] doesn't want your past to be held
[1:19:03] against you
[1:19:06] amen and so that's why but but we must
[1:19:09] also remember we have received the
[1:19:12] spirit of adoption whereby you cry Abba
[1:19:14] Father now we understand that adoption
[1:19:16] in the in the uh Jewish way of things is
[1:19:21] not say if we go to China and we get a
[1:19:23] Chinese baby and we come bring it and we
[1:19:25] sign some papers now they're part of the
[1:19:26] gloin family that's not adoption in
[1:19:29] Bible language in Bible language it's a
[1:19:32] placing of a son or I say or a daughter
[1:19:35] into the family it's already been born
[1:19:36] into the family but now they're placed
[1:19:39] into a level of
[1:19:40] responsibility amen that is that is
[1:19:43] adoption in in in Bible
[1:19:45] language so now if if the spirit of God
[1:19:49] has come upon you and changed you and
[1:19:52] amen you are a son or daughter of God
[1:19:56] Amen he say well you say well brother
[1:19:59] Ben why are you talking about these
[1:20:00] things you need to really this has got
[1:20:03] to Anchor in like nothing else because
[1:20:07] God cannot lose a part of
[1:20:09] himself amen God will not lose a part of
[1:20:12] himself and you can see it in Adam and
[1:20:14] Eve Adam could not lose Eve amen
[1:20:18] remember Eve was deceived the scripture
[1:20:19] says Eve was deceived Adam had his eyes
[1:20:22] WI open he knew what he was doing and he
[1:20:25] tried to and he did it because he wanted
[1:20:27] to try and save Eve because Adam knew
[1:20:31] that if his life was in in Eve then God
[1:20:35] could not take her amen because they're
[1:20:38] part of one another and Adam knew Adam
[1:20:40] knew hey he had a whole bunch more ribs
[1:20:43] and and evidently ribs are one of the
[1:20:45] parts of the body that actually can grow
[1:20:47] back amen so he knew he had a whole
[1:20:49] bunch of ribs but he didn't have any
[1:20:51] more feminist part of himself
[1:20:53] so there's no so a body a female body
[1:20:56] could be made but there's no feminist
[1:20:58] Spirit to go into that body and so he
[1:21:00] knew if he lost he he lost it all amen
[1:21:04] it's the same thing with God God could
[1:21:05] not lose one of his amen because he's
[1:21:08] only got so much
[1:21:11] woman amen that's been born through
[1:21:13] every age a bride through every age and
[1:21:16] he can't lose a part of that amen it's
[1:21:19] like building you know Peter says that
[1:21:21] we're Lively or living Stone
[1:21:23] built up into the house of God you know
[1:21:26] you can't complete a house or a building
[1:21:28] if there's a stone
[1:21:29] missing amen very simple but you got to
[1:21:32] understand and you got to and that's why
[1:21:34] I want to say these things because you
[1:21:35] got to recognize if there's something in
[1:21:37] you that wants him amen and he doesn't
[1:21:40] and you may think well I'm just going to
[1:21:42] do my own kind of life but he keeps
[1:21:44] stepping on your path stepping on your
[1:21:46] path trying to get your attention you
[1:21:49] know normally God is only obligated to
[1:21:51] everyone once amen but God in his
[1:21:54] infinite grace and mercy he'll keep
[1:21:55] trying to get your attention and come
[1:21:58] upon your heart and speak to you and
[1:22:00] bring people across your path because
[1:22:03] why is that he's trying to get your
[1:22:04] attention saying you're part of me where
[1:22:07] are you going amen he wants to get your
[1:22:10] attention because he wants you to be a
[1:22:12] child of the
[1:22:14] Resurrection
[1:22:16] Hallelujah and so whereby you cry Abba
[1:22:18] Father or my father or my you know you
[1:22:20] know my father my father
[1:22:23] B me and then the spirit itself beareth
[1:22:25] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:22:27] children of God so there's something in
[1:22:29] The Believer I mean after they've really
[1:22:31] given it all I just say one thing don't
[1:22:34] hold anything back amen I don't care
[1:22:37] what kind of you know Paul and I said it
[1:22:39] a couple of Sundays ago and I was a bit
[1:22:41] shocked at myself I said you just got to
[1:22:43] forget everything you've ever known and
[1:22:45] Paul said I count everything but dung
[1:22:48] that I may win Christ so and he had more
[1:22:51] religion than all of us combined amen
[1:22:54] but he said I count it all but
[1:22:57] dung amen he didn't hold it in a steam
[1:22:59] oh this is wonderful this is wonderful
[1:23:01] he counted it but D that he may win
[1:23:04] Christ and so that's why when I said
[1:23:06] that I was thinking about but then that
[1:23:07] scripture came to mind I say well that's
[1:23:09] just the Bible just in a different
[1:23:12] way
[1:23:14] amen so the spirit itself beareth
[1:23:16] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:23:18] children of God and there's something
[1:23:21] and you can't put into language but
[1:23:22] there's just something you know all the
[1:23:24] way down through the Bible it's been
[1:23:26] there's people have tried to put on
[1:23:28] paper or God through them has tried to
[1:23:30] put on paper what it's like to meet
[1:23:33] God Amen but there's always the there's
[1:23:37] there's unless someone's experienced it
[1:23:40] you cannot understand it amen you know
[1:23:44] you you know you take Moses in the
[1:23:45] burning
[1:23:46] bush I don't know how he would have
[1:23:48] really well I know cuz I've met that
[1:23:51] same God but trying to convey that to
[1:23:53] others there was a bush that wasn't
[1:23:55] burning I mean was burning but it wasn't
[1:23:57] consumed and a voice spake out of that
[1:23:59] Bush saying I'm the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:24:01] and Jacob amen and then you know all the
[1:24:04] Believers all the way down through what
[1:24:06] it's like cuz there's a very there's a
[1:24:07] massive
[1:24:09] difference it may sound very much the
[1:24:11] same well I'm a Christian I've been
[1:24:13] baptized God's done a work and I'm sure
[1:24:16] he has but there's a big difference
[1:24:18] between saying that and saying I've
[1:24:20] really met him and my life is no longer
[1:24:22] the same amen because we can get built
[1:24:25] up on emotion but emotion will fail amen
[1:24:29] people get and remember if God brings
[1:24:33] emotion the spirit of God brings emotion
[1:24:37] amen but emotion is not
[1:24:39] it amen when you meet him for yourself
[1:24:42] you'll see there's been a change in
[1:24:45] you
[1:24:47] amen it's not just an emotion but
[1:24:49] emotion's definitely a part of it
[1:24:54] now but so but then when you really meet
[1:24:57] him something in you that bears witness
[1:24:59] you know there's no
[1:25:01] condemnation amen you know you don't
[1:25:03] have that weight of sin anymore you know
[1:25:04] something's happened to you amen and
[1:25:07] that's why this your spirit Beth witness
[1:25:09] with his I mean the spirit itself
[1:25:11] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:25:13] are the children of God and then
[1:25:15] children then we're ears and ears of God
[1:25:17] and Joint ears with Christ if so be that
[1:25:20] we suffer with him that we may be also
[1:25:23] glorified together now this word child
[1:25:27] there in
[1:25:29] verse sorry in verse 17 and 21 so that's
[1:25:33] children and CH uh um children
[1:25:36] there it means one
[1:25:40] born and so if we are and that is the
[1:25:43] same word there in in Luke saying the
[1:25:46] children of the resurrection and so if
[1:25:48] we're born of the Resurrection now we
[1:25:52] receive receive certain
[1:25:53] benefits okay now
[1:25:57] Jesus when Jesus came the first
[1:26:00] time the Believers passed sure they
[1:26:03] passed from Death un life but before the
[1:26:07] day of Pentecost they were cowards they
[1:26:10] were scared and when the pressure came
[1:26:13] on they couldn't overcome whatever the
[1:26:15] enemy was trying to do against them you
[1:26:17] see Peter's a perfect example now I got
[1:26:19] a reason I'm going this way I want okay
[1:26:21] so Peter was perfect example he says
[1:26:23] Lord I won't deny you you know I'll you
[1:26:26] know I'll do all these kind of things
[1:26:28] I'll I I'll Stand By You then the Lord
[1:26:30] even says before the Roo or the
[1:26:32] crows you'll deny me three times amen
[1:26:36] and then what happened the pressure
[1:26:37] comes down even tries to kill a guy says
[1:26:40] well we might go down swinging and mean
[1:26:43] he tries to kill a guy with the sword
[1:26:44] and do all kinds of things then when the
[1:26:46] pressure came on aren't you one of them
[1:26:49] don't you know him and he and he denies
[1:26:51] the Lord three times even curses while
[1:26:53] doing it so when the pressure came on he
[1:26:56] couldn't hold the pressure but then
[1:26:59] after the day of Pentecost didn't matter
[1:27:01] what persecution came on they rejoiced
[1:27:04] they prayed the spirit of God came down
[1:27:06] and broke whatever the enemy was trying
[1:27:08] to do because they were now the children
[1:27:10] of the
[1:27:11] Resurrection amen they were the children
[1:27:13] of the Resurrection because that because
[1:27:16] the resurrection came into them amen and
[1:27:20] it wasn't remember this is not just oh
[1:27:22] that's a nice idea or isn't that neat
[1:27:25] that really happened amen God came into
[1:27:28] them and then God lived out of them and
[1:27:30] didn't matter what the enemy tried to do
[1:27:32] they were beaten they said Don't Preach
[1:27:33] in his name anymore they're beaten did
[1:27:35] that cow them though they went out
[1:27:37] rejoicing thank you Lord that I've been
[1:27:39] counted worthy to be persecuted for your
[1:27:41] name's sake
[1:27:44] Hallelujah and so they they were given
[1:27:47] the power to live above the world that
[1:27:49] they are in amen they were given the
[1:27:51] power to live above the world they were
[1:27:53] in and to live in this world Amen and it
[1:27:57] didn't matter what part of the body they
[1:27:58] were if they were Apostles or or was it
[1:28:01] Doras that made um clothes and sold them
[1:28:04] and things doesn't matter what part of
[1:28:05] the body they were in they all were
[1:28:08] anointed to overcome what the enemy was
[1:28:10] doing because they were risen you know
[1:28:13] and that word Resurrection means to
[1:28:14] stand up again amen so
[1:28:19] man Adam was standing in the garden but
[1:28:22] then man fell and man was Fallen all the
[1:28:25] way down through even though God
[1:28:27] anointed man and all things happened but
[1:28:29] man had fallen and it was only in the
[1:28:32] Resurrection season that man could
[1:28:33] really stand up again amen and take
[1:28:36] dominion over Satan and his
[1:28:38] devices Hallelujah that they weren't you
[1:28:41] know Paul Paul before he met the Lord on
[1:28:44] the road to Damascus before he met the
[1:28:46] resurrection he was he was a slave he
[1:28:49] was a servant of that religious system
[1:28:52] he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and
[1:28:54] he was just one of their monkeys doing
[1:28:56] the dance amen playing to their tune
[1:28:59] dancing to their tune but then when he
[1:29:01] met the resurrection he wasn't under
[1:29:03] that yoke
[1:29:05] anymore amen I think we ought to Rejoice
[1:29:09] amen he didn't you know he wasn't Bound
[1:29:11] by those things he was risen above those
[1:29:13] things and didn't matter what the enemy
[1:29:15] tried to do to him he was he was he he
[1:29:18] was in
[1:29:19] control amen and his circumstances sure
[1:29:22] didn't bother him there he is standing
[1:29:24] before King AG grippa however many years
[1:29:27] after the road to Damascus experience
[1:29:29] he's in
[1:29:29] Chains and he and he begins to preach to
[1:29:32] him
[1:29:33] Christ and then King AG grippa says you
[1:29:35] almost persuaded me to become a
[1:29:38] Christian and he says I wish you
[1:29:41] would amen except for these
[1:29:43] bonds but remember Paul wasn't the one
[1:29:46] in in Chains he was the freest man in
[1:29:50] that room amen amen cuz here was a man
[1:29:53] that if his breath left him his life
[1:29:55] left him he'd go up into Glory he wasn't
[1:29:58] afraid he says a crown of life awaits me
[1:30:02] Hallelujah he'd already been taken
[1:30:03] beyond the curtain of time he knew he
[1:30:06] knew where he was going he wasn't
[1:30:07] worried about it he says to you know he
[1:30:09] said you know not not in these words but
[1:30:12] but he basically said I'd rather be in
[1:30:14] glory but it's good that I'm here amen
[1:30:17] that's what he said so he wasn't
[1:30:20] afraid whatever happened if he was
[1:30:23] beaten if he was Shipwrecked if he was
[1:30:25] robbed or whatever happened he just
[1:30:28] walked with God because he was a child
[1:30:30] of the Resurrection he was he was lifted
[1:30:33] above all of these things that he faced
[1:30:37] Hallelujah and that was the benefit now
[1:30:42] of Jesus
[1:30:44] rising yeah because remember
[1:30:46] Christianity is not me standing here and
[1:30:48] telling you about a historical Jesus you
[1:30:51] can't get the you know you know the
[1:30:54] expression you cannot get warm next to a
[1:30:56] painted fire amen if he's real then he's
[1:30:59] real if he's not if he's only a god of
[1:31:02] History it does us no good amen but he's
[1:31:05] not a god of History am mean he's a
[1:31:07] resurrected alive present this morning
[1:31:11] here with you everywhere you go he's
[1:31:13] with you he's alive amen let's not get
[1:31:17] bogged down in Tradition and oh this is
[1:31:19] how we do things and whatever kick that
[1:31:21] out the formality all that kind of
[1:31:23] nonsense amen he's alive amen and don't
[1:31:27] constrain him or restrain him to what
[1:31:29] you think he should
[1:31:31] do amen don't limit God by what you
[1:31:34] think he should do and so he was able to
[1:31:37] live above all of these
[1:31:40] things and then now you come down
[1:31:43] remember Jesus said because they said to
[1:31:46] him Master give us a sign he says a
[1:31:50] wicked and adulterous generation seeks
[1:31:51] after signs but you'll get a sign you'll
[1:31:55] get the sign of the prophet Jonah as
[1:31:58] Jonah was in the belly of the whale you
[1:32:00] know three days whatever more so shall
[1:32:02] the son of man be in the earth and and
[1:32:04] brother B says what sign was that the
[1:32:06] sign of the
[1:32:08] Resurrection
[1:32:10] amen and then now 2,000 years go
[1:32:15] by and then now is a adulterous Wicked
[1:32:18] generation upon the Earth and God said
[1:32:21] I'll send them a sign I'll send them the
[1:32:23] sign of the
[1:32:24] Resurrection amen and the sign of the
[1:32:27] Resurrection is what he did back there
[1:32:28] he does the same thing because the sign
[1:32:31] of the Resurrection is the proof that
[1:32:32] he's alive Hallelujah and then now Here
[1:32:36] Comes Here Comes Elijah the spirit of
[1:32:38] Elijah sent to the Earth unto a prophet
[1:32:40] and he stands there and he says it
[1:32:42] thousands of times I hope not
[1:32:44] exaggerating that he says it heaps he
[1:32:45] says the sign he says we have the sign
[1:32:50] of the Resurrection amen we have the
[1:32:53] proof that Jesus is Alive amen and he
[1:32:57] doesn't and he says and he's here and
[1:33:00] then he said now what did Jesus do
[1:33:01] before the cross and knew what the
[1:33:03] people were thinking everything about
[1:33:05] them amen and he says to show you he's
[1:33:08] here he begin to point people out you
[1:33:10] just go listen to a message am mean it's
[1:33:12] done in front of thousands of people
[1:33:14] watch the Deep call for you know deep
[1:33:16] call to the Deep thousands of people in
[1:33:17] that big AUD um um Auditorium there and
[1:33:21] he and he calls people out not just
[1:33:23] people in the prayer line gives them
[1:33:24] their name their address where they you
[1:33:26] know what they were doing I see you
[1:33:28] sitting on the bed praying and you feel
[1:33:29] like you're going to fall over all you
[1:33:31] know all those different things right
[1:33:33] down to what they had and and he was God
[1:33:36] was doing that because he said remember
[1:33:39] he said I'm just your brother I can't
[1:33:42] heal you yep Jesus already done it by
[1:33:46] his stripes
[1:33:48] we
[1:33:49] were ah true but were the scripture we
[1:33:53] it's finished so he says why does why
[1:33:55] does God come down that way and give
[1:33:57] Visions Vision after Vision I see this I
[1:34:00] see this this is where you're from you
[1:34:01] know people who you know eyewitnesses
[1:34:04] said you were just naked you couldn't
[1:34:06] hide anything you knew you couldn't hide
[1:34:07] anything from God Amen that's the same
[1:34:10] thing today but you see that was all
[1:34:13] done that the faith of the people would
[1:34:15] rise that they would receive their
[1:34:16] healing because he says I can't heal you
[1:34:19] Jesus if even if you were standing here
[1:34:21] he couldn't do it cuz he's already done
[1:34:23] it
[1:34:24] amen just like salvation Salvation is
[1:34:27] already done but faith has to rise that
[1:34:30] you can get a hold of what he's done for
[1:34:33] you amen so he says many times he says
[1:34:36] this is the sign of the
[1:34:38] Resurrection now there's benefits
[1:34:42] there's benefits to the
[1:34:44] resurrection amen I want you to
[1:34:46] understand so now he was for 2,000
[1:34:50] years the lamb our lamb has been a
[1:34:54] mediator amen he's been standing because
[1:34:57] there's one mediator between man and God
[1:34:59] the man Christ Jesus amen so he's been a
[1:35:02] mediator between you and God Amen for
[1:35:07] this whole world he's been a mediator
[1:35:09] and so he's the goet I put it that way
[1:35:12] remember he's the blood he's the
[1:35:14] sacrifice and so when God when God looks
[1:35:17] down and sees you he doesn't see you he
[1:35:19] sees the blood amen so it's not you this
[1:35:23] is why you've just got to kick out of
[1:35:25] your mind
[1:35:27] forever your what you feel are
[1:35:30] insufficiencies amen because God doesn't
[1:35:33] see you he's not looking at you he's
[1:35:35] looking at the
[1:35:36] blood amen and all he hears is your
[1:35:39] voice through the
[1:35:40] blood amen that's all he sees so it's
[1:35:44] not all me and what you know my
[1:35:46] personality and what I'm going through
[1:35:48] you know we we have a sticky brother B
[1:35:52] says we have a sticky part this this
[1:35:55] body our sticky nature amen and it's
[1:35:59] always with us Yep this flesh is always
[1:36:03] with us until the body change amen our
[1:36:06] soul is redeemed this flesh is not
[1:36:08] redeemed so your first nature is with
[1:36:11] you whether you say praise the Lord or
[1:36:13] woe is me amen it's it's there but if
[1:36:18] you're a child of the Resurrection you
[1:36:21] you have been risen above this first
[1:36:24] nature amen there's a life that comes
[1:36:27] into you that allows you to live above
[1:36:29] this
[1:36:29] thing amen but then even but then even
[1:36:33] if you may slip back into that first
[1:36:34] nature again it doesn't mean you're lost
[1:36:38] remember if you've been redeemed you
[1:36:40] don't put yourself back as a
[1:36:42] sinner amen you must never do that but
[1:36:46] you if if you confess your sins he's
[1:36:48] faithful and just to forgive you am
[1:36:51] amen so you got to you know you just got
[1:36:54] to recognize I live in this
[1:36:56] body this body is not redeemed just just
[1:37:00] come to peace with it amen that means
[1:37:02] your emotions and your your conscience
[1:37:04] your reasoning everything your spirit
[1:37:06] realm that's not redeemed is this okay
[1:37:10] you just got to come to peace with it
[1:37:12] amen but it's your soul that's been
[1:37:15] redeemed amen and so you just got to let
[1:37:18] your soul take control of every other
[1:37:20] part of you
[1:37:22] amen that's why some people they can
[1:37:23] have such a
[1:37:25] Victorious however long period of time
[1:37:27] and then they fall over then they get up
[1:37:29] and say well am I really a Believer or
[1:37:32] not
[1:37:34] absolutely amen amen you're still a
[1:37:37] Believer you just got to recognize this
[1:37:39] guy remember when you receive the Holy
[1:37:41] Ghost it's not like a switch is flicked
[1:37:43] and every and now you become a robot and
[1:37:46] everything's fine and I'm going to Crest
[1:37:48] every wave amen it doesn't work that
[1:37:51] that way oh but that's a bit
[1:37:53] disappointing no it's not because God
[1:37:56] wants to show his salvation even in a
[1:37:59] fallen group of people he wants to show
[1:38:02] his salvation is greater than what the
[1:38:04] enemy
[1:38:05] did I mean what did the enemy do he took
[1:38:08] the serpent which wasn't a snake in the
[1:38:10] beginning and mixed it with the human
[1:38:12] race I mean that's why we have now these
[1:38:14] Hybrid Bodies with a not just a flesh
[1:38:17] hybrid body but a spirit realm that's
[1:38:20] hybrid
[1:38:22] amen remember Eva's called the mother of
[1:38:24] all living never says Adam was search
[1:38:26] the scripture amen he says that Cain was
[1:38:29] of that Wicked one in the New Testament
[1:38:32] and that word of means point of origin
[1:38:35] in the Greek amen it's not there you
[1:38:38] cannot find Cain and Adam's lineage why
[1:38:40] is that cuz he's not a son of Adam he's
[1:38:42] a son of the serpent but now there's a
[1:38:45] mix amen so it's those who are
[1:38:49] redeemable are the sons of of
[1:38:52] God
[1:38:53] amen amen so so we have these Fallen
[1:38:56] bodies but God wants to show because
[1:38:58] remember the devil in the garden that
[1:39:00] was his best
[1:39:01] shot he says how can I because he knew
[1:39:04] God was holy remember he was the
[1:39:05] anointed cherub that cover he knew what
[1:39:08] worship was he knew that God is a holy
[1:39:10] God so he says now how can I get the
[1:39:12] people to fall how can I get all of
[1:39:14] humanity how can I cause his children to
[1:39:17] fall that now they can never get back to
[1:39:20] him
[1:39:22] amen it wasn't a it wasn't all see what
[1:39:24] happens no he planned it he knew what it
[1:39:26] was like how how animals mix and all
[1:39:28] these you know he knew how biology
[1:39:30] worked and knew the spirit realm how it
[1:39:33] worked amen so so he worked it out says
[1:39:37] now if I do this there's no way they're
[1:39:39] beyond Redemption and they're stuck in
[1:39:41] this condition amen then but then but
[1:39:45] then the first promise it's so neat the
[1:39:48] first prophecy to come out of God's
[1:39:49] mouth was actually to the end
[1:39:51] enemy the seed of the woman is going to
[1:39:54] crush the head of the seat of the
[1:39:55] serpent amen and that was the first
[1:39:57] prophecy of Jesus coming then here comes
[1:40:00] the seat of the woman created in a in a
[1:40:02] you know created in Mary's womb here's
[1:40:04] the seat of the woman steps out
[1:40:06] Hallelujah and now here he is he said
[1:40:08] I'm going to undo all these things I'm
[1:40:10] going to bring my children forth
[1:40:13] Hallelujah and they may still be in
[1:40:14] these Fallen bodies but the life in them
[1:40:17] is going to
[1:40:18] overcome Hallelujah that's why you've
[1:40:20] just got a that's why you got to have I
[1:40:22] trust you now I know it's not by feeling
[1:40:24] but I trust you know who you really are
[1:40:26] in
[1:40:27] God Amen I trust you really know I am a
[1:40:30] son or a daughter of God hallelujah
[1:40:34] because if you know that remember Jesus
[1:40:36] you shall call his name Jesus for he
[1:40:39] shall save his people from their sins
[1:40:43] amen oh what about everyone else don't
[1:40:45] worry about everyone else the only way
[1:40:47] you can help everyone else is get a hold
[1:40:49] is let God get a hold of you then you
[1:40:51] can help everyone else amen cuz cuz some
[1:40:54] people madej you what about all the
[1:40:55] world and everything that's going on
[1:40:57] don't worry about them worry about you
[1:40:59] then say Lord send me to wherever you
[1:41:01] want to send me amen and then so now
[1:41:05] he and then so Jesus came the
[1:41:09] resurrection became flesh amen I am the
[1:41:13] resurrection and the life he said to
[1:41:14] Mary or Martha believest thou this just
[1:41:16] before he's going to raise up Lazarus I
[1:41:18] am the resurrection and the life so the
[1:41:20] resurrection became flesh but he didn't
[1:41:22] want that Resurrection just to be in him
[1:41:25] amen he wanted that Resurrection to
[1:41:27] become flesh in his
[1:41:28] church amen and then so he gave the
[1:41:31] people the ability to live
[1:41:34] above am mean live Above This flesh
[1:41:37] because the greatest miracle I think
[1:41:38] I've said it before the greatest miracle
[1:41:40] that Jesus did was not feeding the
[1:41:43] thousands raising the dead stopping
[1:41:45] nature whatever it was the greatest
[1:41:47] Miracle he was is go to Calvary as a man
[1:41:50] and subject himself to the word of God
[1:41:54] Amen and take the sins of the world to
[1:41:55] the Cross as a man that's the greatest
[1:41:59] Miracle because Adam Adam in his Fallen
[1:42:01] State he couldn't you know all of the
[1:42:05] prophets down through they had a
[1:42:07] weakness in their
[1:42:08] flesh amen and Satan hit that weakness
[1:42:12] and they fell amen they could not fully
[1:42:15] subject themselves to the
[1:42:17] word amen but now here comes a man
[1:42:21] who tempted on All Points like we were
[1:42:23] who went through everything we go
[1:42:25] through in life amen was rejected and
[1:42:28] despised of
[1:42:29] men amen know knows all the live through
[1:42:33] all the hardships that we do and more
[1:42:36] besides cuz he says he said the son of
[1:42:39] man doesn't even he says Foxes of dens
[1:42:41] birds of nests but I don't have a place
[1:42:43] even to
[1:42:44] sleep we have a house we have a bed you
[1:42:47] know we have all these things he didn't
[1:42:48] have those things and amen he became the
[1:42:51] poorest of the
[1:42:53] poor and he did
[1:42:56] that in order to show that man can live
[1:43:01] above the
[1:43:03] world Amen
[1:43:05] Hallelujah and then so now but remember
[1:43:08] now time slipped away but the what he's
[1:43:12] wanting to do now is there benefits of
[1:43:15] the
[1:43:16] resurrection and so when he comes when
[1:43:20] he is
[1:43:21] risen amen he brings benefits with them
[1:43:25] now brother Bram says it and you can see
[1:43:27] it in church history you you see in
[1:43:30] church history you see the day of
[1:43:31] Pentecost you see the book of Acts God
[1:43:33] displays himself in a mighty a quick
[1:43:35] short work of power and then the church
[1:43:38] begins to go down and dies in the Dark
[1:43:39] Ages then comes forth again and the
[1:43:42] reason that happened is because they
[1:43:43] mixed man's traditions and Creeds of man
[1:43:46] in with the pure word of God and if you
[1:43:48] mix in Creeds of man and you know things
[1:43:52] that are not the Bible then it then it
[1:43:54] actually limits God's ability to
[1:43:56] work amen you can see it in the Old
[1:43:59] Testament they begin to worship other
[1:44:00] gods then what happened the enemy comes
[1:44:02] in and and takes dominion over them but
[1:44:05] if they stuck to the pure word of God
[1:44:07] say we have nothing to do with all this
[1:44:08] stuff they would have been Victorious
[1:44:10] every
[1:44:11] generation amen and then so now so
[1:44:14] brother Bram says that the that the Holy
[1:44:16] Ghost has been bound at the doors of you
[1:44:20] know do of churches by the Creeds and
[1:44:22] doctrines of man amen and that's why
[1:44:25] that's why you see the you know
[1:44:27] Pentecostal move in the very you know
[1:44:28] book of Acts God living in his people
[1:44:31] then his work continuing amen but you
[1:44:33] don't really see that until this day
[1:44:36] amen amen you see it in a smaller degree
[1:44:39] Through the Ages but not the fullness of
[1:44:41] it as it was in the beginning amen
[1:44:43] because the Creeds and doctrines of men
[1:44:45] bound the holy
[1:44:47] spirit amen the people still met the
[1:44:49] Lord they still knew knew him amen but
[1:44:52] he was limited but then now God has
[1:44:54] restored his
[1:44:56] word amen so he says he's been bound for
[1:44:59] 2,000 years but then through the end
[1:45:02] time message the Holy Ghost is loosed
[1:45:04] upon the people again Hallelujah and I'm
[1:45:06] sure many of us can attest to that
[1:45:08] reality and so now the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:10] loosed upon the people and we can say
[1:45:14] now he's risen
[1:45:16] again amen he with me because he was
[1:45:20] they tried to put him in a Roman tomb of
[1:45:22] denominationalism down through 2,000 odd
[1:45:25] years amen but now the stones been
[1:45:28] rolled away remember brother Brown
[1:45:30] preaching a sermon it's the rising of
[1:45:32] the sun I trust this is not just up in
[1:45:34] here for you amen but he's actually
[1:45:36] making a declar declaration he says when
[1:45:40] that Easter you know that Sunday morning
[1:45:42] when the sun rose he said it was a dual
[1:45:45] sun rising a natural sun was Rising but
[1:45:47] now the Son of God was rised from the
[1:45:49] dead Victorious over hell death in the
[1:45:52] grave Hallelujah the Earth couldn't hold
[1:45:54] him the Earth can't hold you this world
[1:45:57] can't hold you amen the Creeds and
[1:45:59] everything of man cannot hold you
[1:46:02] remember he was the first of the
[1:46:04] Resurrection amen and he says to you he
[1:46:06] says because I live you shall live also
[1:46:10] Hallelujah he's not just talking about
[1:46:11] natural life he's talking about Immortal
[1:46:13] Life
[1:46:15] amen and so he says so so he's saying
[1:46:18] now it is the rising of the sun and when
[1:46:21] the Sun rises it's heralding a new day a
[1:46:24] new Time Has Come amen so now he comes
[1:46:29] to the end remember everything Adam lost
[1:46:32] has to be
[1:46:33] restored amen and so Adam lost dominion
[1:46:38] over the Earth yeah I know I've said
[1:46:41] these things but I really wanted to
[1:46:43] Anchor in amen everything Adam lost has
[1:46:46] to be
[1:46:47] restored but because God wants to
[1:46:49] display the power of the Cross he wants
[1:46:52] to restore it to man Even though man is
[1:46:55] still in the sinful condition
[1:46:58] hallelujah amen so man man is going to
[1:47:01] be restored see it's not oh when I
[1:47:04] receive a new body then I'll be like
[1:47:05] Adam was in the garden now God wants you
[1:47:08] to be like Adam in the garden this side
[1:47:11] of the body
[1:47:12] change amen hallelujah so everything so
[1:47:16] Adam had dominion over nature he had
[1:47:18] dominion over everything upon the this
[1:47:20] Earth cuz he was made God of this
[1:47:23] Earth amen he had remember God was you
[1:47:26] know man was a minor God under the Lord
[1:47:30] God as we know is Jesus
[1:47:32] Christ and so he wants to restore man
[1:47:36] back to that condition even in these
[1:47:40] bodies amen and so as I said and I've
[1:47:43] said a few times when when there's a
[1:47:45] resurrection there's benefits of that
[1:47:47] Resurrection amen so now he says now I'm
[1:47:50] just going to try and tie this all
[1:47:52] together I trust it sinks
[1:47:54] in remember he says there's a there's a
[1:47:56] jeel sun
[1:47:58] rising amen not just a natural son Rose
[1:48:03] the Son of God Is
[1:48:04] Risen
[1:48:06] amen and we can even read
[1:48:09] it it says in the Book of
[1:48:13] Malachi let's just read
[1:48:16] this I'm going to try and wind this
[1:48:19] up
[1:48:23] Malachi 4:2 but unto you that fear my
[1:48:26] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:48:29] arise with healing in his wings and you
[1:48:32] shall grow go forth and grow up as
[1:48:34] carves of the sto and you shall tread
[1:48:37] down the wicked for they shall be ashes
[1:48:39] Under The Souls of your feet in the day
[1:48:41] that I shall do this sayth the Lord of
[1:48:43] hosts so he's promised that he shall
[1:48:46] arise with healing in his wings amen so
[1:48:50] there will be another rising of the sun
[1:48:52] you see and then now on this
[1:48:55] day this day we have remember he's been
[1:48:58] our mediator for 2,000 years remember
[1:49:02] and he still is our mediator but then
[1:49:04] there comes a time where the book the
[1:49:07] title deed that Adam lost is claimed by
[1:49:11] a man again amen amen and so it's in
[1:49:14] this season where and it says and John
[1:49:18] looked and the book was sealed with
[1:49:20] Seven
[1:49:21] Seals amen no one was found worthy to
[1:49:24] take that book so no one was found
[1:49:26] worthy to restore what Adam lost no man
[1:49:30] and and John wept but then one of the
[1:49:33] you know one of the elders I think said
[1:49:35] that we're not John for the light of the
[1:49:36] tribe of Judah has prevailed and has
[1:49:39] been counted worthy and brother R says
[1:49:41] here comes Jesus coming out of the
[1:49:43] eternities he was in his mediatorial
[1:49:46] work now he comes to lay claim on what
[1:49:48] he has purchased amen amen now he's come
[1:49:51] to lay claim on what he's purchased and
[1:49:53] he takes that book and he opens the
[1:49:56] seals of that book amen and so what he's
[1:49:59] doing now remember it's all symbolic but
[1:50:01] he's saying remember this is actually
[1:50:03] the book cuz all of everything that Adam
[1:50:05] lost is in this book amen and so now
[1:50:08] here comes the lamb he takes hold of his
[1:50:11] purchased possession and he doesn't
[1:50:14] leave it bound he looses it amen now
[1:50:18] Hallelujah you are part of that
[1:50:20] book I may be going way far out there
[1:50:23] but I just want you to think about this
[1:50:25] he takes you remember he sends his
[1:50:29] word amen yeah my wife she had to quote
[1:50:32] with me how how brother bam says that
[1:50:34] Jesus is the right hand of God and he
[1:50:37] has made known by his
[1:50:39] word amen so what happens is now Jesus
[1:50:42] Remember Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:50:44] hearing the word of God so now man
[1:50:47] preaches man's inspired and he preaches
[1:50:49] and then Faith Rises and then the people
[1:50:53] become free and they walk with God but
[1:50:56] what that does now is the word being
[1:50:58] preached is actually God laying
[1:51:00] claim amen he lays claim on what belongs
[1:51:03] to him through the preaching of his word
[1:51:06] so what happens now is he steps forth
[1:51:09] and he's doing this he's laying claim
[1:51:11] remember he and he has to do this to
[1:51:13] free you that all the other ages that
[1:51:15] died in the faith can come forth amen so
[1:51:18] so through the preaching of the word he
[1:51:20] lays claim on you and then he picks you
[1:51:22] up to where he is but he doesn't leave
[1:51:26] your life sealed up amen just like in
[1:51:29] the Tomb he didn't leave Jesus wasn't
[1:51:31] stuck in the Tomb sealed up are you
[1:51:33] following me and then he picks you up
[1:51:36] and then he re he releases the seals
[1:51:38] that have bound you up amen and reveals
[1:51:41] who you really
[1:51:43] are Hallelujah and he carries you away
[1:51:46] amen
[1:51:48] hallelujah amen amen that's why or you
[1:51:51] say well how does that work well go back
[1:51:53] in your own life you're doing all kinds
[1:51:55] of things the devil had you beaten down
[1:51:58] then one day you hear the real gospel
[1:52:01] amen and then you begin to realize who
[1:52:03] your father really is amen and you begin
[1:52:06] to understand you don't belong to this
[1:52:08] world remember when you you if you're in
[1:52:10] an orphanage you say well I'm just part
[1:52:11] of this orphanage but then if you're if
[1:52:13] your parents step into the room and you
[1:52:16] look at them and say hey that guy looks
[1:52:17] like me it says son daughter come amen
[1:52:21] then you say now I belong to them that's
[1:52:24] why my little girls I say mommy daddy
[1:52:26] and the little whoever's you know we're
[1:52:28] playing bear or lions or whatever it is
[1:52:30] you're the daddy bear mommy's the mommy
[1:52:32] bear or you we're the little lions you
[1:52:34] know or the Bears whatever you know
[1:52:35] because it's so fixed into them this is
[1:52:38] Mommy and Daddy if I know where Mommy
[1:52:40] and Daddy are now and then I'm part of
[1:52:42] the family so now I have my I have my
[1:52:45] security amen that's the same thing with
[1:52:48] us I trust justice mean something to you
[1:52:51] I mean if you really know who your
[1:52:52] father is that's why when he lays claim
[1:52:54] on you you can say my father Abba Father
[1:52:56] my father my father
[1:52:59] Hallelujah and then the things that once
[1:53:01] hold you held you back he begins to
[1:53:04] release them he begins to break those
[1:53:06] chains break those seals and then he
[1:53:10] really shows you who you really are on
[1:53:11] the
[1:53:12] inside amen because if you just look at
[1:53:14] IM if this book was sealed say well it's
[1:53:17] you okay this is interesting this
[1:53:20] leather on this book is actually Pig
[1:53:22] leather pig
[1:53:24] skin according to the care instructions
[1:53:26] when I got it it's amazing
[1:53:29] because uh that is considered an unclean
[1:53:32] animal amen but this is the word of God
[1:53:36] and I say that sums me up pretty well
[1:53:39] outside is an unclean
[1:53:41] animal Hallelujah but within is the word
[1:53:43] of God and because the word of God is on
[1:53:47] the inside it makes the outside clean
[1:53:50] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but if
[1:53:53] it was sealed up you you wouldd say well
[1:53:55] this is the leather and this is how
[1:53:57] thick it looks and you know it looks
[1:53:58] nice you don't know what's on the inside
[1:54:01] just like you you didn't know what was
[1:54:02] on the inside of you amen oh this is my
[1:54:05] parents this is my nationality this is
[1:54:07] what we do that's not the real that's
[1:54:09] the
[1:54:10] outside amen but when you hear the word
[1:54:12] he lays claim on you he takes the seals
[1:54:15] off and then you begin to really see
[1:54:17] what's in you amen and that's what he
[1:54:20] brings remember through through through
[1:54:23] much tribulation do we enter into the
[1:54:24] kingdom of God the scripture says amen
[1:54:27] so don't count it
[1:54:28] strange I'm going through you some heart
[1:54:31] or some trial or whatever more God's
[1:54:34] allowed it cuz he wants to show you
[1:54:36] what's in the inside of the
[1:54:38] book amen why did why did in the days of
[1:54:42] Gideon maybe we need some musicians to
[1:54:44] come but why in the days of
[1:54:46] Gideon why did he allow the midianites
[1:54:49] and the people of of the East to
[1:54:50] basically eat up the whole
[1:54:51] country cuz he wanted to show get in
[1:54:54] what's on the inside of him behold
[1:54:57] you're a mighty man of
[1:54:58] Val I don't look like a mighty man of
[1:55:01] Valor look what's on the inside of you
[1:55:03] I'm going to show
[1:55:05] you
[1:55:06] amen and with 300 men I don't even know
[1:55:10] if they swung a sword they just blew the
[1:55:11] trumpet sha the light broke the picture
[1:55:13] and they killed each other all done
[1:55:15] let's sit back and watch what happens
[1:55:18] amen and it's a same thing with you I
[1:55:21] don't enjoy it he says count it all joy
[1:55:24] count it all joy when you go through
[1:55:26] hardship and trials and whatever more
[1:55:28] because what does God want to do
[1:55:31] remember God does not have confidence in
[1:55:33] your
[1:55:34] flesh brother BR preach a sermon perfect
[1:55:36] strength and perfect
[1:55:38] weakness and he says many times we think
[1:55:40] of weaknesses as excuses that's not what
[1:55:42] it is he says perfect weakness is being
[1:55:45] perfectly
[1:55:46] surrendered amen if you're perfectly
[1:55:48] surrendered then you can have perfect
[1:55:50] strength that's the only way you can
[1:55:52] have perfect strength amen is being
[1:55:56] completely dependent upon the
[1:56:00] Lord and so that's why God allows
[1:56:02] hardship and all these things he wants
[1:56:03] to show what's in you amen that's why I
[1:56:07] say you
[1:56:08] know we don't even brother R preached
