[13:05] to worship and praise
[13:08] God the word that I have over you this
[13:11] evening is
[13:15] surrender and maybe we we think Lord
[13:17] give me Victory give me power give me
[13:19] all these things but we get none of that
[13:22] none of that unless we make a total
[13:26] surrender you know the Lord tries to
[13:28] overtake us with his love we we see our
[13:30] life going going down and things and
[13:32] it's the Lord trying to overtake us and
[13:35] when we're finally ready to surrender he
[13:38] hands us terms and conditions which are
[13:39] total
[13:40] surrender and you know if we're not
[13:42] ready to make a total surrender he'll
[13:44] keep battling on there's no half
[13:47] measures there's no I'll give you some
[13:48] and I'll keep the
[13:49] rest I don't want to make it sound hard
[13:51] but if we want the Holy Ghost it's a
[13:53] total surrender you got to say Lord I to
[13:55] totally surrender I totally surrender
[13:57] there's no unless you forsake all and
[13:59] follow me you cannot be my
[14:03] disciple that's the truth you know when
[14:06] I'm when I really made the total
[14:07] surrender a song came and it was oh
[14:08] sweet Jesus take my life all its
[14:11] failings all its Strife you're the only
[14:13] thing I've ever done that's right I
[14:15] Surrender now completely wrap your arms
[14:18] around me sweetly as I hear you softly
[14:20] say you are
[14:22] mine and I believe you know if you
[14:26] haven't received the Holy Ghost and made
[14:27] that total surrender you will tonight
[14:30] and you know even if you've gone on down
[14:31] the road you actually need to surrender
[14:33] daily what as Paul said I Die daily I
[14:36] Surrender daily we can go on in our walk
[14:38] and then start to get a little bit and
[14:40] we start to stand up against God a bit
[14:41] more than what we used
[14:44] to we do and we need to stop that we
[14:48] need to say Lord I Die daily I Surrender
[14:51] daily but we are of those that surrender
[14:54] cuz that's why we're
[14:54] [Music]

[36:53] name
[36:55] amen praise the Lord um if we could now
[36:58] have the Shana Fellowship up they were
[37:00] very nice items thank you very
[37:02] much that was very enjoyable to listen
[37:05] to you're very good at um singing and
[37:07] playing and it's a blessing to be able
[37:08] to give that to the Lord am mean we
[37:11] could give that to the devil but they've
[37:12] decided to give it to the Lord amen amen
[37:14] so this is the um just as they get set
[37:19] up so I made a wee bit of um put your
[37:22] hand up Sister
[37:25] Priscilla so we bit of fun with fun of
[37:28] her this morning because she asked you
[37:29] know for her item to be first so no one
[37:32] if someone has the same item they won't
[37:34] do it but um well they would have to
[37:36] change the item um I had the same
[37:40] fears I'm being honest remember last
[37:43] year we did we had two churches do the
[37:45] same item so we I figured well the only
[37:48] way to get around that is maybe if we
[37:49] write one
[37:50] ourselves a new song
[37:52] then unless people were really spiritual
[37:55] and you know caught the same inspiration
[37:57] then they wouldn't know the song you
[37:58] know so we we wouldn't risk it but
[38:02] um we had
[38:04] um just as they're getting set up so
[38:07] we yeah I sort of said that to the choir
[38:09] I said now they were putting forward
[38:10] songs I said now let's let's write one
[38:13] and we'll expect the Lord to just give
[38:14] us one that we can sing at the camp and
[38:17] do it but it was um time was running out
[38:19] I think it was a Wednesday and we had to
[38:20] have the first practice on the Sunday
[38:22] and then we had one more practice and
[38:23] then it was the camp so yeah we we w't
[38:26] as tight spot so we
[38:29] um went to church on a Wednesday and
[38:31] brother um adaman spoke about dry bones
[38:34] and how speak to the dry bones Speak
[38:37] Life and um you know you just hear
[38:40] something and it kind of came it comes
[38:42] alive and so um this is I guess a little
[38:46] song We Made For You at the camp here
[38:51] um I like slower songs I write slower
[38:54] mow mellow songs I just play the guitar
[38:56] and St and more heartfelt but I find
[38:58] with a choir they get they've got a
[39:00] short attention
[39:02] span they like it to sort of you know
[39:04] you got to be moving hey you do a slow
[39:07] one they're like no I don't do that I
[39:08] sent forward slow songs no boring you
[39:10] know you got to it's got to move so this
[39:12] is like a little bit different than what
[39:13] I usually write but it's they wanted
[39:15] something with a bit of
[39:19] snap so are we
[39:23] ready 1 2 three 4

[57:52] just
[57:53] now whatever ever it is just be specific

[58:00] God that
[58:01] answers Heavenly Father we just come

[58:06] reverence of your holy presence father

[58:46] we ask amen
[58:50] amen if you have your Bibles we just
[58:53] turn to the book of Isaiah thank you m
[58:56] Isaiah thank you
[58:58] musicians and just a little thought on
[59:00] our heart tonight and
[59:02] uh just pray the Lord give us Grace
[59:06] Isaiah
[59:07] 60 and then we'll go to Isaiah 21 just a
[59:11] couple verses in
[59:20] each 60 Isaiah 60 veres
[59:23] 1-2 a familiar reading to all of
[59:27] us um brother brandom used it in the
[59:31] many times and in the message Shalom it
[59:35] says arise Shine for thy light is come
[59:38] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[59:40] thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover
[59:43] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[59:45] but the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[59:47] His glory shall be seen upon thee and in
[59:51] then in chapter 21 of Isaiah uh just
[59:54] just verses 11 and
[59:58] 12 I'd like to take a thought tonight on
[1:00:02] it's time to shine it's time to shine
[1:00:06] verses 11 and 12 there um it says the
[1:00:10] burden of Duma he calleth to me out of s
[1:00:14] Watchman what of the night Watchman what
[1:00:16] of the night and the Watchman said the
[1:00:18] morning cometh and also the night if you
[1:00:21] will inquire inquire ye return come and
[1:00:24] me you may have your seats and we just
[1:00:26] want to take this little thought on it's
[1:00:28] time to shine and brother brandom would
[1:00:31] show us that the heavens are a type of
[1:00:33] what's going to happen on Earth how God
[1:00:35] wrote his first Bible in the heavens how
[1:00:38] how you could look at at Vergo and Leo
[1:00:41] and it would declare his first coming
[1:00:43] through a virgin birth and his second
[1:00:45] coming as Leo the Lion and in the
[1:00:48] heavens would
[1:00:49] declare what what what God would show us
[1:00:51] in the scripture and what what what God
[1:00:53] was going to do on the Earth Earth and
[1:00:55] we brother brother brandom says that
[1:00:56] every Christian is a
[1:00:58] star and we know that God speaks through
[1:01:01] the heavens and so he he even called the
[1:01:03] children of Israel as the stars and and
[1:01:05] he would say these these are my children
[1:01:07] and and Abraham tried to number them
[1:01:09] they're as the stars of the sky and and
[1:01:12] so we know it's a very very powerful
[1:01:15] type and and God uses stars all
[1:01:17] throughout the Bible the star led the
[1:01:20] wise men and and brother brandom said
[1:01:21] what did the star mean to us today
[1:01:23] friend and and then he goes to Daniel he
[1:01:26] said Daniel gives us the answer in
[1:01:27] Daniel 12:3 it said those that are wise
[1:01:30] and know their God shall shine as the
[1:01:32] firmaments of the heaven and those that
[1:01:34] turn many to righteousness shall shine
[1:01:36] as the Stars forever and ever and so he
[1:01:39] says what are we today then he said We
[1:01:42] Are Stars he said every born again
[1:01:44] Christian is a testimony to the Lord
[1:01:46] Jesus Christ a star to reflect reflect
[1:01:49] the power and Holiness of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:52] to reflect him in his life and to
[1:01:55] perfect him in his speech to perfect him
[1:01:57] in his healing power to perfect him in
[1:01:59] his resurrection to reflect him in every
[1:02:01] way that he was reflected To Us by God
[1:02:03] the Father we are stars and uh I may
[1:02:07] just do a little reading to lay a
[1:02:08] foundation here so just bear with me um
[1:02:11] but he said every Christian is a star to
[1:02:13] guide the lost to guide the weary the
[1:02:15] star cannot be guarded by uh Guided by
[1:02:18] itself it must be led by the spirit it
[1:02:21] must reflect the brilliancy of God in
[1:02:24] its life to abstain from the things of
[1:02:26] the world to live Godly and soberly in
[1:02:28] this present life it must reflect the
[1:02:30] light of this great one that shined and
[1:02:32] and and a star is not Guided by its own
[1:02:35] power it's Guided by another power and
[1:02:38] the Bible tell us that that there's no
[1:02:40] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:02:42] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:02:44] after the spirit and so as Christians to
[1:02:46] reflect the presence of God we're not
[1:02:48] looking to be guided by our own our own
[1:02:50] selves or or our own mental Powers but
[1:02:53] we're Guided by a higher power and we're
[1:02:56] meant to abstain from the things of the
[1:02:57] world we're not meant to blend in with
[1:02:59] the world we're not we're not meant to
[1:03:01] build a church that looks like the
[1:03:02] churches of the world we're not meant to
[1:03:04] live a life that looks like the lives of
[1:03:05] the world but you're meant to be a
[1:03:07] separated people you're Meant To Be A
[1:03:09] peculiar people and Abstract people
[1:03:12] according to the ways of the world but
[1:03:14] glorious according to the word of God he
[1:03:17] said come out from among them and be
[1:03:19] separate touch not the unclean thing and
[1:03:21] I will receive you separate yourselves
[1:03:23] onto this word for the glory of God Amen
[1:03:27] not Guided by our own power and in 1
[1:03:30] Corinthians 15:41 it says there is one
[1:03:33] glory of the sun another glory of the
[1:03:35] Moon and another glory of the stars for
[1:03:37] one star differ from another star in
[1:03:39] glory and brother B would take that and
[1:03:42] he said we're told in the Bible that the
[1:03:43] Stars differ one to another one star
[1:03:47] differs from another he said there's a
[1:03:48] difference in Heavens and Angels Angelic
[1:03:51] beings there's angels and chims and
[1:03:53] seraphim he said they're different and
[1:03:55] we're all different we're not meant to
[1:03:57] compare our lives one to
[1:03:59] another and and our looks and our
[1:04:02] talents and our abilities because God
[1:04:04] has you where he wants you God has you
[1:04:06] where he needs you to be in the body of
[1:04:08] Christ and God's placed you there
[1:04:10] according to his knowledge of of of what
[1:04:12] you could do best and how you could
[1:04:14] serve the body of Christ best so we're
[1:04:16] not meant to get little schisms amongst
[1:04:18] us and little jealousies but one star
[1:04:21] differeth for from another amen and it
[1:04:23] would be becoming of you to serve the
[1:04:26] Lord according to what he's called you
[1:04:27] to do amen but we're not just going to
[1:04:31] talk about stars in general but
[1:04:33] specifically the Morning Star brother
[1:04:35] Brandon would tell us about the morning
[1:04:37] star and what does the morning star mean
[1:04:39] it it comes out just before Daybreak
[1:04:42] when all the other stars begin to fade
[1:04:44] away when the moon itself begins to fade
[1:04:47] away right at that day break that's when
[1:04:49] the Morning Star comes out and and
[1:04:51] brother BR said he stands alone he's
[1:04:53] God's Watchman that stands alone and
[1:04:55] what he's doing is that Sun's fixing to
[1:04:57] rise and that morning star stands up
[1:04:59] there as a Watchman to reflect that Sun
[1:05:02] reflect that Sun as it begins to rise
[1:05:04] and let us know that this Sun's fixing
[1:05:06] to rise we're fixing to see the Sun but
[1:05:08] we know it's there because we see its
[1:05:10] light reflecting on the morning star and
[1:05:12] it reflects the True Light of the true
[1:05:14] sun it's reflecting not its own light
[1:05:17] it's not reflecting the church light
[1:05:19] it's reflecting the light of the sun
[1:05:21] amen and brother Bram said what is it
[1:05:23] the Morning Star the Church of the
[1:05:24] Living God today and he says down he
[1:05:27] says what is the true Church's Ministry
[1:05:30] he said the ministry of that church will
[1:05:32] be the ministry of the sun because it's
[1:05:34] a reflection of the same sun power in
[1:05:37] the same sun light that the world will
[1:05:39] know when the Sun rises what it will
[1:05:41] look like he says it's ready to
[1:05:43] reflecting the light the suns are
[1:05:45] shining on the star he said now it isn't
[1:05:47] the church it isn't the person it's the
[1:05:50] sun reflecting on the star that reflects
[1:05:52] the sunlight to the Earth so if we could
[1:05:54] ever get back to the same light if you
[1:05:57] could ever get back to the sunlight that
[1:05:58] Shone in the life of Jesus Christ if you
[1:06:00] could ever come back to that same light
[1:06:03] that Shone on the day of Pentecost in
[1:06:05] the first church if you could ever get
[1:06:06] back to that light it'll have to produce
[1:06:09] the same Ministry for the same light
[1:06:11] will bring the same Ministry it'll bring
[1:06:13] the same power it'll bring the same
[1:06:14] signs it'll bring the same reflection
[1:06:17] because it's the same light amen and
[1:06:19] God's light doesn't change so we've seen
[1:06:21] it progress from Luther's light to
[1:06:23] Wesley's light to to Pentecostal light
[1:06:26] and now brother Brandon said the it's
[1:06:28] coming into that morning star begin to
[1:06:31] reflect and all the churches pulling out
[1:06:33] of every church every nation every
[1:06:34] people a bride for his
[1:06:37] nameen so brother Brandon would begin to
[1:06:39] describe this and Watchmen what of the
[1:06:41] night he said the Watchman said the
[1:06:43] morning cometh and also the night if you
[1:06:45] will inquire inquire your return come
[1:06:47] and brother B said Isaiah wasn't out of
[1:06:49] order he said Isaiah wasn't out of order
[1:06:52] when he said the night cometh in the
[1:06:53] morning morning cometh in the night also
[1:06:55] he said it wasn't out of order but said
[1:06:57] we know the moon shines in the absence
[1:06:59] of the sun because the light that we
[1:07:00] walk in is the light of the sun
[1:07:02] reflected from the Moon he said now
[1:07:04] that's what the church is supposed to do
[1:07:07] he said when the sun come uh what
[1:07:09] reflect the presence of God while the
[1:07:11] sun is gone and when the church comes up
[1:07:14] or when the sun comes up the moon's gone
[1:07:16] but just before day did you ever notice
[1:07:18] the moon gets real pale and it goes out
[1:07:20] and I'll tell you the church has already
[1:07:22] turned pale it's anemic it got away from
[1:07:24] the blood it got away from salvation and
[1:07:26] the Holy Ghost and the teaching of the
[1:07:28] word and it's become anemic so so we
[1:07:31] begin to see that there's a pattern here
[1:07:33] that there's a little bit of light and
[1:07:34] then there's darkness and then there's
[1:07:36] another light the breaking of the day so
[1:07:38] he's saying morning's coming but there's
[1:07:40] night coming first and mean and this is
[1:07:43] the order of the night and brother BR
[1:07:44] said we've had that first little light
[1:07:46] he said uh notice the morning cometh in
[1:07:49] the night also we've had a great Revival
[1:07:51] amongst the Full Gospel people it's been
[1:07:53] a a great thing we've seen healings done
[1:07:56] and signs and wonders but remember now
[1:07:57] he said the morning cometh but the night
[1:07:59] also he said it's begin to darken up
[1:08:02] again and he would tell how how they
[1:08:03] used to fill the buildings and and how
[1:08:06] they would see Mighty Miracles and he
[1:08:07] would tell a story about a Mr Mrs
[1:08:09] waldrup that raised from the dead he
[1:08:11] said they used to pack the churches and
[1:08:13] he would talk about this great first
[1:08:15] light this great campaign that would
[1:08:17] take place and he said now you preach 20
[1:08:19] minutes and people get sick of it he
[1:08:21] said what happened there was a first
[1:08:23] little light but that Darkness Be to
[1:08:25] creep back in and he said the alarm went
[1:08:27] off and they shut the alarm off because
[1:08:30] it seemed like well maybe it's not time
[1:08:32] to get up yet so they shut the alarm off
[1:08:34] and went back to bed during that that
[1:08:36] first light and then Darkness began to
[1:08:38] creep in and instead of shining like the
[1:08:40] Morning Star should they went back to
[1:08:42] bed and they shut the alarm off he said
[1:08:44] brother brandom commands us not to do
[1:08:46] that he says don't shut the alarm off
[1:08:48] but this is the time when the Morning
[1:08:50] Star is supposed to rise and shine this
[1:08:52] is the time when you're supposed to rise
[1:08:54] and and trim your lamps and Shine for
[1:08:56] the glory of God he said don't shut your
[1:08:58] alarm off and say well uh we'll put it
[1:09:01] off to another day we'll put it off to
[1:09:02] another time there there may not be
[1:09:04] another day coming there may not be
[1:09:05] another time coming so don't shut the
[1:09:08] alarm I say you should get out of bed
[1:09:10] and and get about the business of the
[1:09:12] Lord and Shine for the glory of the Lord
[1:09:15] amen he said when the preacher warned of
[1:09:17] the coming of God and the coming of the
[1:09:18] Son of God he said don't turn your alarm
[1:09:20] off don't try to drown it don't go back
[1:09:22] into the world say I got a few Wild Oats
[1:09:24] to sew he said you 35 ye olders and you
[1:09:26] teenagers don't try that jump to your
[1:09:28] feet let the alarm glow that's God's
[1:09:31] holy spirit warning you to flee from the
[1:09:32] Wrath that is to come amen he said when
[1:09:36] that dark time comes then the Morning
[1:09:38] Star comes out and it's the brightest
[1:09:40] stars in the heaven is the Morning Star
[1:09:42] he said don't miss this now the Morning
[1:09:44] Star comes out between the little light
[1:09:46] spell and the real breaking of day as
[1:09:49] soon as it gets real dark just before
[1:09:50] the break of day The Morning Star shines
[1:09:52] its brightest and and we're living in a
[1:09:55] dark time we're living in the Leo DEA
[1:09:57] age where Darkness has come in but but
[1:10:00] though we're in the world we're not of
[1:10:02] the world and and though darkness is
[1:10:04] coming and though there's a great
[1:10:05] Darkness it it's time for the church to
[1:10:07] rise and shine amen is that the church
[1:10:11] is to reflect his light and God's light
[1:10:13] will be reflected in his church and more
[1:10:15] powerful than ever just before the
[1:10:18] coming of the Lord Jesus amen we see the
[1:10:20] order we see the order of the night and
[1:10:22] we know it's dark dark we all know it's
[1:10:25] dark and brother Brandon would preach a
[1:10:26] message Shalom he said behold in Isaiah
[1:10:29] 60 how we read it he said the darkness
[1:10:31] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[1:10:33] the people but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:10:35] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[1:10:37] these so the Watchman has a warned us
[1:10:40] that danger is approaching he he said
[1:10:42] that that that people would come and
[1:10:44] talk to him and say if the world knew
[1:10:45] what they were talking about amongst the
[1:10:47] the military and things he said they
[1:10:49] would be scared to death and and he
[1:10:51] would talk about these men com and say I
[1:10:53] wish I could could just you know take my
[1:10:54] old wagon and drive it out into the
[1:10:56] woods uh we were excited about
[1:10:59] advancements but it's got so far
[1:11:00] advanced in the hands of evil men that
[1:11:02] they're going to use it to destroy the
[1:11:04] world and they would try to escape it
[1:11:06] but what was it it was Darkness was
[1:11:08] approaching and and and we had a
[1:11:10] Watchman up in the tower that said it's
[1:11:12] the time it's the running out of time
[1:11:14] and the coming of the Lord we're
[1:11:16] witnessing them both at the same time
[1:11:18] the Watchmen could look up and see these
[1:11:20] things and he said morning is coming for
[1:11:22] those that are prepared prepared but
[1:11:24] night is coming for those that are not
[1:11:26] prepared and me it's darkness and gross
[1:11:29] Darkness we see Darkness on the earth we
[1:11:31] see modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:11:33] we see the world shaking and trembling
[1:11:35] all around us we see the darkness it
[1:11:38] it's easy to see the darkness and it's a
[1:11:40] Gloom that's hanging on the earth and
[1:11:42] it's also gross Darkness on the people
[1:11:45] uh it's a spiritual Darkness that's
[1:11:46] crept in on the people just to be a
[1:11:48] pretty good person just to be a good
[1:11:50] church member just to not really really
[1:11:53] ser serve the Lord under the reality of
[1:11:55] the word but just to go to church and
[1:11:57] fill a Pew and and just to put your name
[1:12:00] on a book or shake a hand it's spiritual
[1:12:02] darkness that has crept gross darkness
[1:12:04] that has crept over the people amen and
[1:12:07] and it's not just enough to be a be a
[1:12:09] part of the church for the church is
[1:12:10] condemned brother BR said we know she
[1:12:13] goes to outer Darkness but the bride
[1:12:15] goes up but he says what does that he
[1:12:17] said it's Pride it's Pride that gets in
[1:12:20] and because you want to fit in and and
[1:12:22] and you're not willing to fully cross
[1:12:24] over into the blessings of the word you
[1:12:26] you don't want your work friends and
[1:12:28] your school friends to to think that
[1:12:30] you're uh maybe a heretic or to think
[1:12:33] that you're some crazy man so you'll
[1:12:35] just kind of sit there in the middle and
[1:12:36] try to blend in and and it's Pride that
[1:12:39] gets in and tries to tries to keep you
[1:12:41] from fully entering in and and what it
[1:12:43] is it's it's what brother B would say is
[1:12:46] what does it all mean he said what made
[1:12:48] the moon Fade Out what made the moon
[1:12:51] which is the church Fade Out is it's the
[1:12:52] world got in its shadow he said the
[1:12:55] world shuts out the light that we're
[1:12:56] supposed to be reflecting swings itself
[1:12:58] around and gets into it and as they pass
[1:13:00] one another it throws Darkness over it
[1:13:03] he said the world has come into the
[1:13:04] church in the name of denomination the
[1:13:07] name of some Creed and we're religious
[1:13:08] and all this and all this but yet it
[1:13:10] denies the resurrecting power of Christ
[1:13:12] to vindicate the word that's prophesied
[1:13:13] for this day me what is it uh we are all
[1:13:17] familiar with the picture of the of the
[1:13:19] church ages and it has all the the
[1:13:21] different moon phases on it from the
[1:13:23] seven Church ages and and brother
[1:13:25] Brandon would tell us about this and he
[1:13:27] said recall that in the first stage it
[1:13:29] was almost a full orb Church of Truth
[1:13:31] and and it would go through in the next
[1:13:34] stage more Darkness crept in and and
[1:13:36] then Darkness covered the circle and the
[1:13:38] third age it was Eclipse still more and
[1:13:40] the fourth age which was the Dark Ages
[1:13:41] the light had all but gone and and and
[1:13:44] then he talks of course about
[1:13:45] restoration began to come and and Luther
[1:13:48] begin to come in Wesley and and light
[1:13:50] began to creep back in and and more
[1:13:52] light begin to creep back in but then in
[1:13:53] that seventh age when it looked like
[1:13:55] illumination was coming back to the
[1:13:57] church all of a sudden it went into
[1:13:59] total eclipse and it went into total
[1:14:01] darkness and and and brother BR said
[1:14:03] that in the seventh stage the total
[1:14:05] darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul
[1:14:08] the 6 went to Palestine to make a holy
[1:14:10] tour of Jerusalem he was the first pope
[1:14:12] to ever go to Jerusalem and and his name
[1:14:15] was Paul I 6 which brother Bram said was
[1:14:17] no coincidence because well Paul was the
[1:14:19] first Messenger to the age we all know
[1:14:21] that and this man goes by that name he
[1:14:23] said but notice it's the sixth or the
[1:14:25] number of man and when he went to
[1:14:28] Jerusalem the moon or the church went
[1:14:30] into total darkness this is it this is
[1:14:32] the end this generation shall not pass
[1:14:34] until all away until all be fulfilled
[1:14:36] even so Lord Jesus come quickly and and
[1:14:39] it begins to tell about this Darkness
[1:14:41] the total eclipse of the church as this
[1:14:43] Pope visited Jerusalem and and and his
[1:14:46] name was Paul I 6 but we know that a
[1:14:48] pope is just an impostor of a true
[1:14:50] Prophet here here he was named Paul
[1:14:53] which was our first church age messenger
[1:14:55] but he was an impostor it was man it was
[1:14:57] darkness and and brother Brandon would
[1:14:59] talk about how uh um he said that that
[1:15:02] people would flock to him he said he was
[1:15:04] the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem
[1:15:06] and and people would flock to him and
[1:15:08] people would bow down them and brother
[1:15:10] BR talks about how this Darkness
[1:15:11] spiritual darkness and and those going
[1:15:14] across the street might have worshiped
[1:15:15] them but they didn't realize that it it
[1:15:17] wasn't really a true light but it was a
[1:15:20] a a a total eclipse coming on the church
[1:15:23] amen and Christ was on the outside in
[1:15:26] that seventh age Christ was knocking at
[1:15:28] the door but the church shut him out the
[1:15:30] church didn't let him in and brother
[1:15:32] brandham but brother Brandon when he
[1:15:33] drew that last seventh moon in the seven
[1:15:36] Church agency put a little light in
[1:15:38] there and he put it in there for me and
[1:15:40] you because there was an elect upon the
[1:15:41] Earth that wasn't a part of that
[1:15:43] Darkness but they were a part of the
[1:15:45] light and mean we find that that that
[1:15:48] that natural Jerusalem is not is not our
[1:15:51] representation but in Revelations 21 it
[1:15:53] says I John saw the holy city New
[1:15:56] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:15:58] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:16:00] her husband and he said the Bride of the
[1:16:02] church is the New Jerusalem how many
[1:16:04] knows that the church itself is the New
[1:16:07] Jerusalem he said you believe that he
[1:16:09] said and we're taught in the New
[1:16:10] Testament in the message Shalom don't
[1:16:12] fail to get this in the New Testament
[1:16:14] that we are not of this city Jerusalem
[1:16:17] on Earth but we are from the New
[1:16:19] Jerusalem Above So then he says so this
[1:16:22] must be the Moon Jerusalem and not the
[1:16:24] noon Jerusalem above so the moon
[1:16:28] representing the church Earthly the Moon
[1:16:31] that was in total eclipse was
[1:16:32] representing Jerusalem Earthly but not
[1:16:35] Jerusalem Heavenly but we are of the
[1:16:38] city New Jerusalem we are the bride
[1:16:40] adorned for her husband a a and God put
[1:16:43] a light in this age because he knew
[1:16:45] there would be some Believers that
[1:16:46] wouldn't shut him out but they would let
[1:16:48] him in and we've received a true Prophet
[1:16:51] to Jerusalem and we're walking in True
[1:16:53] Light and our King isn't the pope but
[1:16:55] our King is MDC the King of Kings the
[1:16:58] Lord of lords without beginning of days
[1:17:00] or ending of days but he came from God
[1:17:02] God stepped into flesh and brought us a
[1:17:04] message and and God brought us a Word of
[1:17:07] Life in this day that we could walk in
[1:17:09] light that we wouldn't have to walk in
[1:17:10] darkness but we could walk in truth
[1:17:12] reveal Truth for this day amen aren't
[1:17:15] you thankful that God gave us a true
[1:17:17] Watchmen aren't you thankful that God
[1:17:19] gave us a true word of light amen we
[1:17:22] should never take it for
[1:17:23] granted and brother B said if God put
[1:17:26] them in there talking about a a
[1:17:28] five-fold Ministry and things he said
[1:17:30] they're qualified for the job God
[1:17:32] wouldn't put a man in a tower in a
[1:17:34] position like that that said the days of
[1:17:36] Miracles are passed God wouldn't put a
[1:17:38] man in the tower that said Jesus Christ
[1:17:41] was not the same yesterday today and
[1:17:43] forever God would not put a man in the
[1:17:45] tower that would preach a wishy-washy
[1:17:47] gospel and not tell the truth and warn
[1:17:49] the people of the Wrath that is to come
[1:17:52] but he put someone that's bold he said
[1:17:53] but he said God will never put a blind
[1:17:55] prophet in the tower God will never put
[1:17:58] someone with spiritual blindness in the
[1:17:59] tower but he put an eagle with Clear
[1:18:02] Vision in the tower that could look out
[1:18:04] and he could see the darkness and he
[1:18:06] could see the light and he could declare
[1:18:07] unto you what's coming and give you a
[1:18:10] proper warning Amen brother BR say if
[1:18:12] the Bible said that the baptism of Holy
[1:18:15] Ghost ceased then he would teach it that
[1:18:17] way but that's not what the Bible said
[1:18:19] he said if the Bible taught Miracles
[1:18:21] ceased with the apostles then he would
[1:18:23] teach that but that's not what the Bible
[1:18:24] said if the Bible would have said
[1:18:26] healing was no more then brother Brandon
[1:18:28] would have taught it because he was a
[1:18:30] word Prophet but because that's not what
[1:18:32] the Bible said brother brandom didn't
[1:18:33] teach that but he was high enough up to
[1:18:36] see the scriptures tying together and
[1:18:38] give you a true revelation of this word
[1:18:40] that you could walk in the light for
[1:18:42] your day amen because he was an eagle
[1:18:45] that's the reason he could get so high
[1:18:47] and see the light and the Darkness he
[1:18:49] could see the night's coming but don't
[1:18:52] worry the morning morning is coming also
[1:18:54] amen and God has beg to separate light
[1:18:57] from
[1:18:58] darkness and and what does it mean God
[1:19:02] has beg to separate the light from the
[1:19:03] darkness pressing it behind like he did
[1:19:05] in the beginning to show the dawn of the
[1:19:07] new day and he says down farther you are
[1:19:10] not of the world Little Children You are
[1:19:11] of heaven and this is not your home so
[1:19:14] we're in the world but not of it and
[1:19:16] mean in Solomon's day brother Brandon
[1:19:18] would talk about he had such a gift of
[1:19:20] discernment that the people would come
[1:19:21] and flock to him and the people would
[1:19:23] come and they prospered in wealth and
[1:19:25] riches and and they would never lose a
[1:19:28] battle they were prospering and brother
[1:19:29] brandom said it could have been a golden
[1:19:31] age for them it could have been a golden
[1:19:33] age or or even it was a golden age in
[1:19:36] that hour but he would talk about even
[1:19:38] in our day that we could have had that
[1:19:39] same thing that we could be living in a
[1:19:41] golden age and even America where where
[1:19:44] we're from because brother Brandon came
[1:19:46] from America and he said if they would
[1:19:47] have received his gift if they would
[1:19:48] have accepted his ministry then America
[1:19:51] could be in a golden age but the world
[1:19:53] rejected it but there is a people that
[1:19:56] Reed this message and though the world
[1:19:58] is in darkness though Leo DEA is going
[1:20:00] into darkness there is a bride who is
[1:20:03] living in a golden age there is a bride
[1:20:05] who is not in darkness but she's
[1:20:07] reflecting the true sunlight the very
[1:20:09] same Ministry that Jesus had when he
[1:20:11] left the Earth is coming back into a
[1:20:13] bride body don't you know in Hebrews 11
[1:20:15] it said that they without us canot be
[1:20:17] made perfect what's it going to take
[1:20:19] friends to bring them from the graves
[1:20:21] it's going to take the very same
[1:20:22] Ministry that Jesus had when he was here
[1:20:24] on the Earth would have to come back
[1:20:26] into a bride body to produce the very
[1:20:28] same life recognize who you are you're
[1:20:31] more than just a the son of your parents
[1:20:35] naturally but you're a son and a
[1:20:36] daughter of God bringing forth the very
[1:20:39] same Ministry the very same life that
[1:20:41] was in Jesus Christ amen don't ever
[1:20:45] underestimate the power of what's inside
[1:20:47] of your life amen and brother BR said
[1:20:51] the spirit of God moved upon the face
[1:20:52] face of the water and said let there be
[1:20:54] light and God separated the light from
[1:20:55] the darkness he said I believe we're
[1:20:57] living in that hour again when God is
[1:21:00] separating light for Darkness he said
[1:21:01] we're not looking back but we're looking
[1:21:03] forward to the breaking of the day
[1:21:06] there's something great laying ahead of
[1:21:07] us where the years has been the joy that
[1:21:09] we've looked forward to the press and
[1:21:11] coming of the great light and now we can
[1:21:13] see it breaking Over The Horizon's
[1:21:15] horizontal realm it's breaking between
[1:21:17] Mortal and immortality we see it
[1:21:20] breaking between heavens and earth from
[1:21:21] an EarthBound nness and troubled world
[1:21:24] into a bright shining day as of an
[1:21:26] immortal life and an immortal body and
[1:21:28] Immortal Earth that shall never pass
[1:21:29] away it's shalom onto the church it's
[1:21:32] the light time coming for the Believers
[1:21:34] but a gross Darkness for the people
[1:21:37] brother Burley this is what you've been
[1:21:38] looking for for years and years and
[1:21:40] years We're Not Looking Backward we're
[1:21:42] not looking to turn around but we're
[1:21:43] looking to press towards the breaking of
[1:21:45] the day we're looking to press into the
[1:21:47] light it's a pressure because the
[1:21:49] darkness is being separated from the
[1:21:51] light that's what you feel this great
[1:21:53] pressure of darkness in this age and you
[1:21:55] look at the news and you you look all
[1:21:57] around you and you just feel the
[1:21:58] pressure of Darkness but what is it it's
[1:22:00] pushing out the light it's the breaking
[1:22:03] of the day it's the coming forth of the
[1:22:05] fullness of the word of a bride
[1:22:07] manifested fully that'll be here on this
[1:22:10] Earth and take a Rapture she'll fulfill
[1:22:12] the word that was spoken over her amen
[1:22:15] the darkness is gathering to show the
[1:22:17] light How can there be Darkness and
[1:22:20] Light it's got to be separated and only
[1:22:22] one thing separates it the word
[1:22:23] manifested separates it presses it to
[1:22:26] the other side but he said when the
[1:22:27] manifested word of God the son which it
[1:22:29] was spoken into existence by the word
[1:22:31] shows itself Darkness runs to the other
[1:22:34] side and that's what's taking place now
[1:22:36] Darkness separating itself from the
[1:22:38] light and and further down he said it's
[1:22:40] the going between It's always darkest
[1:22:43] just a few minutes before day the
[1:22:45] blackout comes the moon fails to shine
[1:22:46] the darkest before day because the light
[1:22:49] is pressing the darkness but the Morning
[1:22:51] Star comes out and says good morning
[1:22:54] shalom shalom to the elected lady Shalom
[1:22:57] to the bride Shalom to those that are
[1:22:59] walking in the light amen for Paul said
[1:23:02] you were sometimes Darkness but now are
[1:23:04] ye light in the Lord walk as children of
[1:23:07] light Shalom to those who have the word
[1:23:09] down in their heart Shalom to those who
[1:23:11] have received that light amen we have
[1:23:14] light to walk in amen just laying down
[1:23:17] this word from from the message shalom
[1:23:19] in these different areas brother and now
[1:23:22] we can see in Psalms that it says Thy
[1:23:24] word is the lamp unto my feet and the
[1:23:25] light unto my path and we read last
[1:23:28] night about that day star shining down
[1:23:30] that Vindicated word lighting our path
[1:23:32] that we could walk in it amen and
[1:23:35] brother brandom said we'll just cut
[1:23:36] right to the point here about this
[1:23:38] message that we believe he said to my
[1:23:40] precious dear brothers and sisters to
[1:23:42] all of you as a servant of God I never
[1:23:45] said this before in the world in this
[1:23:46] church I never said but as a prophet of
[1:23:48] the Lord I say to you this is the light
[1:23:51] walk ye in it
[1:23:53] we're not looking for another light
[1:23:54] we're not looking to a partial light but
[1:23:57] we've already received our light and you
[1:23:59] can walk in it amen and when when the
[1:24:01] word is manifested it becomes light when
[1:24:03] the word is Vindicated it becomes light
[1:24:06] but this message is already Vindicated
[1:24:08] so brother you can walk in it you can
[1:24:10] walk down through the channels you can
[1:24:11] walk down through the messages and it's
[1:24:13] light onto you brother and and and one
[1:24:16] of the prayers of my heart is that I
[1:24:17] want to take my family I say Lord walk
[1:24:20] me through this message Lord every day I
[1:24:22] just want to walk with you through this
[1:24:24] message and you're walking in
[1:24:25] well-lighted paths because the word has
[1:24:28] been uh already Vindicated and you can
[1:24:30] walk in it and you don't have to be
[1:24:32] scared to walk in in Mark 11 you don't
[1:24:34] have to be scared to walk in Mark 16 you
[1:24:36] don't have to be scared to walk in the
[1:24:38] third pole you don't have to be scared
[1:24:40] to walk in the Rapture because it's
[1:24:41] already been Vindicated and you can walk
[1:24:44] in it because the light has already
[1:24:45] Shone upon your path and mean you don't
[1:24:47] have to be worried uh about walking in
[1:24:50] this word because it's already been
[1:24:51] Vindicated ated amen and there's light
[1:24:54] on it and there's no light outside of
[1:24:56] the word of God Amen all man-made lights
[1:24:59] will fa and and and we have beautiful
[1:25:01] lights in this building but one day if
[1:25:04] it would go on long enough they would
[1:25:06] they would go out they wouldn't last
[1:25:07] there would be a time where they began
[1:25:09] and a time where they ended but brother
[1:25:11] brandom said the first light that was
[1:25:13] ever given in the Earth was God's spoken
[1:25:15] word the first light that ever struck
[1:25:17] the Earth was God's spoken word and he
[1:25:19] said the only light that we have today
[1:25:21] in the church is God vindicating his
[1:25:23] light to this generation amen and all
[1:25:25] man-made lights are going to go out but
[1:25:27] there's a spoken word light that's going
[1:25:29] to last and if you walk in that spoken
[1:25:31] word light it's going to last and and if
[1:25:33] God spoke you as a a as one of his
[1:25:36] thoughts and as one of his seeds and
[1:25:38] brother you're going to last because you
[1:25:40] weren't just lit by man-made lights but
[1:25:42] you were lit by the light of God and
[1:25:44] it's a spoken word light and it's going
[1:25:46] to last it's not just going to uh uh be
[1:25:49] dim one day and bright the next day but
[1:25:51] it's a light that never goes goes out
[1:25:53] it's the spoken word light and every
[1:25:55] word that he promised will be will be
[1:25:57] Vindicated brother B said everyone every
[1:26:00] word that he promised will be Vindicated
[1:26:02] amen and that's why we preach the way
[1:26:04] that we do Amen brother Burley that's
[1:26:06] why we can stand here and declare unto
[1:26:08] you that the Lord is going to come
[1:26:10] because it may be tomorrow it may be a
[1:26:12] year from now it may be 5 years from now
[1:26:14] I don't know when he's going to come but
[1:26:16] I can declare unto you that he's going
[1:26:18] to come because every word will come to
[1:26:20] light every word has to come to light
[1:26:23] and so I can tell you that brother it's
[1:26:25] going to come the Rapture is going to
[1:26:27] come the resurrection is going to come
[1:26:30] and I don't have to know when it's going
[1:26:31] to come but I know that every word in
[1:26:33] this Bible will come to life will come
[1:26:35] to full Vindication will come to full
[1:26:37] manifestation and so you can trust it
[1:26:40] and walk in it until it comes to light
[1:26:41] and every seed of God will come to light
[1:26:44] every seed of God will have to come to
[1:26:46] light and we're living in a great light
[1:26:48] because because when when God spoke in
[1:26:50] Genesis let there be light it was one
[1:26:52] wonderful but it was only speaking of
[1:26:54] light that would bring botney life it it
[1:26:56] would bring the botney to life and the
[1:26:58] plants would begin to shine but in this
[1:27:01] this Resurrection in this day in this
[1:27:03] sun rising it's a dual sunrising but the
[1:27:06] sunrising that we've witnessed under
[1:27:08] this message didn't just bring botney
[1:27:10] life to life but it brought you to life
[1:27:12] it brought those Jee seeds that were
[1:27:14] laying in the earth to life and it
[1:27:15] resurrected you and showed you that you
[1:27:18] can have eternal life that you came from
[1:27:20] God and you're going back to God you
[1:27:22] possess an eternal equal equality I mean
[1:27:25] that's what this that's what this this
[1:27:27] light did it it's a greater light than
[1:27:29] that dawn of creation light that was
[1:27:32] spoken in Genesis because it brought you
[1:27:34] to eternal life amen more than just the
[1:27:37] grass out on the
[1:27:39] fields amen it's a light that we can
[1:27:41] rest in it's a light and you say it
[1:27:45] looks awful dark but brother man said no
[1:27:46] matter how dark it gets you can't see
[1:27:48] your hand before you just remember there
[1:27:50] is a man here that can turn on the light
[1:27:52] he said who'll Rapture that church he's
[1:27:54] talking about how that church won't go
[1:27:56] through the tribulation he talking about
[1:27:58] how they won't go through the
[1:27:59] persecution he said no matter how dark
[1:28:01] it gets every word will come to light so
[1:28:03] just hold on and there's a man that can
[1:28:05] turn on the light and there's still a
[1:28:07] man here tonight that can turn on the
[1:28:09] light no matter how long you've walked
[1:28:10] in darkness no matter how long you've
[1:28:12] walked in unbelief there's a man in this
[1:28:14] building that can turn on the light and
[1:28:16] it'll dissolve all doubts about this
[1:28:18] message it will dissolve all doubts
[1:28:20] about your identity because there is
[1:28:22] still a man here that can turn on the
[1:28:24] life and he can make this word come to
[1:28:27] life in your being in your personal walk
[1:28:29] he can turn on the light and you won't
[1:28:31] be walking in confusion anymore but
[1:28:33] you'll be walking in Clarity oh it's a
[1:28:36] man that can turn on the light amen he's
[1:28:38] still here and when every promise is
[1:28:41] fulfilled when death is swallowed up in
[1:28:43] Victory Jesus will come and the last one
[1:28:45] will be Vindicated then there will come
[1:28:47] an eternal peace upon the Earth an
[1:28:49] eternal Shalom an eternal shalom peace
[1:28:52] will rest upon the Earth amen he can do
[1:28:55] nothing until this Bride Comes hither I
[1:28:58] can do nothing till you come hither but
[1:29:00] when that last one is Vindicated there's
[1:29:02] coming an eternal Shalom when that last
[1:29:05] seed when that last word when that last
[1:29:08] thought that was expressed comes to
[1:29:10] light there's going to be an eternal
[1:29:11] Shalom and we'll enter into an eternal
[1:29:14] Shalom amen Watchmen what of the night
[1:29:17] brother brandom told us of the darkness
[1:29:19] and of the light amen he told us of of
[1:29:22] of of the seven visions of this world
[1:29:24] and the Judgment that was coming he told
[1:29:26] us of all these things but but he says
[1:29:28] when we see these fearful sides coming
[1:29:30] earthquakes tidal ways Falling Away
[1:29:33] gross Darkness heady high-m minded
[1:29:34] lovers of pleasure now that's all for
[1:29:36] the world that's what the world is
[1:29:38] pointed to he said but the church has
[1:29:40] another sign he said that blessed called
[1:29:42] out sign he promised that there would be
[1:29:45] a latter rain in the church the church
[1:29:46] spiritual in the last days he'd pour out
[1:29:49] both former and latter rain remember
[1:29:51] former rain came first latter rain came
[1:29:53] second both former and latter rain in
[1:29:55] the same season he promised it so you
[1:29:57] see the promise to this world isn't the
[1:29:59] same promis to you but we've got other
[1:30:01] promises we've got a promise of a former
[1:30:04] and latter Reign being poured out upon
[1:30:06] us we've got a promise uh of a word

[1:30:15] all around us is dying we've entered
[1:30:17] into a Revival into a rest in this hour
[1:30:20] we have promises we're not with without
[1:30:22] promises in this time of of judgment
