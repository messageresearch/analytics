[1:58] welcome to the house of God tonight
[2:00] everyone it's good to see you all in the
[2:04] flesh it's nice having meetings again

[2:28] [Music]
[2:33] I'm glad that the Lord knows our name
[2:36] you know he you know people treat us to
[2:39] swim that way through life but the Lord
[2:40] knows us personally he knows our name he
[2:43] knows every detail about us and he cares
[2:46] for us and I believe that each one of us
[2:48] here that our names were written in the
[2:50] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:52] foundation of the world
[2:54] before we were here before we existed
[2:56] somebody knew us that we were going to
[2:58] be here and what a time to be living in
[3:00] that we can actually be in a time where
[3:02] where God is revealing himself in such a
[3:04] powerful way and we can experience it
[3:06] it's such an amazing time in such
[3:10] Darkness there's such great light
[3:11] amongst us pinch yourself this is the
[3:14] best time we can ever be living in it's
[3:16] a time of such chaos but in yet such
[3:18] power of God for the believer that's
[3:21] such a great time and we are I'm looking
[3:24] forward to a nice
[3:26] um
[3:27] time tonight and the Lord I believe the
[3:28] Lord's going to bless us in a powerful
[3:30] way and I don't know if maybe brother
[3:32] John can't hear me he he's in the back
[3:34] room there but I don't know if me saying
[3:37] this makes me feel old and him feel old
[3:39] or maybe we both started very young
[3:41] [Music]
[3:42] but
[3:43] stand up there Dave so
[3:46] so when Dave was this big
[3:49] you can sit down now say he's got his
[3:51] about that big now but when he was that
[3:53] big

[3:59] brother John was preaching there and he
[4:01] we we it was like a camp a bunch of camp
[4:03] meetings very nice Services actually but
[4:05] I always remember one of um brother
[4:07] John's lines where you sure know how to
[4:10] wear out a preacher because because he
[4:13] had he had every service he took he took
[4:16] the whole camp but it was a very blessed

[38:55] we were here I was here one time before
[38:57] way back 31 years ago
[39:01] when we got married we we got married 30
[39:03] coming on 31 years ago and we came to uh
[39:08] New Zealand for our honeymoon and went
[39:10] to Lake taupo and came down to
[39:13] Wellington and so I guess we're coming
[39:15] back home you know if y'all if y'all cut
[39:18] the tires that we were driving on we'll
[39:20] have to stay around a little bit but
[39:22] well the weather today was really good
[39:24] your pastor took us through the town he
[39:27] said normally it's just windy and blowy
[39:29] there was no wind it was nice and quiet
[39:31] and sunny it's like these people live in
[39:33] the millennium
[39:36] and then brother Ben showed me a photo
[39:38] of Sister Christine in Africa with a
[39:41] cheetah with her just sitting there
[39:43] right by a cheetah I'm like maybe we are
[39:45] in the Millennium amen y'all pet lines
[39:48] and everything around here either that
[39:50] or your pastor's wife is fearless
[39:54] and so I think it's both amen maybe
[39:56] we'll come into the Millennium and your
[39:58] pastor's wife is fear let's say amen
[40:00] hallelujah I was at the same place and I
[40:03] get all nervous around lions and tanks
[40:05] and she looked fine she looked like she
[40:08] was just fine so maybe the line is
[40:10] laying down with a lamb again and
[40:12] amen I know you love the word so let's
[40:15] turn to Isaiah 35 verse 10 no more
[40:18] sorrow
[40:19] this will mean maybe more to the middle
[40:22] aged than older ones but the young
[40:24] people just to put something in your
[40:26] heart Isaiah 35 verse 10. let's read it
[40:29] out loud and The Ransom of the Lord
[40:32] shall return and come to Zion with songs
[40:37] and everlasting Joy upon their heads
[40:40] they shall obtain joy and gladness and
[40:44] sorrow and sighing shall flee
[40:48] did your bible say that
[40:51] sorrow and sighing
[40:54] how many know what a sigheth
[40:59] sign because of life because of troubles
[41:02] sorrow and sign shall flee away can you
[41:08] turn to Isaiah 51 verse 11.
[41:11] another place where
[41:13] this is mentioned in the Bible about
[41:15] sorrow
[41:17] and mourning
[41:21] m-o-u-r-n-i-n-g morning shall flee away
[41:24] let's read this verse out loud you
[41:27] sounded so good earlier therefore the
[41:30] redeemed of the Lord shall return and
[41:33] come with singing unto Zion and
[41:36] everlasting Joy shall be upon their head
[41:39] there
[41:43] and sorrow and mourning shall flee away
[41:46] praise the Lord
[41:49] have you ever had sorrow
[41:53] have you ever been sad
[41:56] we're speaking tonight about a place
[41:59] where sorrow
[42:01] and mourning are going to flee away
[42:05] one last place is the Book of Revelation
[42:08] excuse me for keeping you standing but
[42:11] what are y'all normally do on a Tuesday
[42:12] night
[42:15] y'all usually home or something right
[42:18] we got this is a special meeting
[42:21] so I pray the Lord or just maybe maybe
[42:23] he arranged this whole evening just for
[42:25] you
[42:26] to let you know that he cares and he's
[42:29] mindful of your life
[42:31] whether you're young or old he's mindful
[42:33] of your sorrow
[42:35] he's mindful of your mourning and your
[42:37] sign
[42:39] and he wants you to be encouraged that
[42:41] there's coming a day when all that's
[42:43] going to flee away
[42:46] I like this these verses here in
[42:48] Revelations 21 verse 3.
[42:51] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[42:54] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[42:57] with men
[42:59] and he will dwell with them
[43:02] and they shall be his people
[43:06] and God himself shall be with them
[43:10] and be their God
[43:12] I'm sorry but verse 1 and 2 talked about
[43:14] the new Heaven and the new Earth
[43:17] and verse 2 John was speaking about the
[43:19] holy city a New Jerusalem coming down
[43:21] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[43:25] bride adorned for her husband so it
[43:27] wasn't just talking about a city like
[43:30] Jerusalem or Wellington or Auckland but
[43:33] he was talking about a people
[43:36] he was speaking about a people and the
[43:38] atmosphere that's going to be around
[43:40] that place
[43:42] would you like to know what it's going
[43:44] to be like there's not going to be
[43:46] sorrow there
[43:47] is not going to be mourning and a lot of
[43:50] sign
[43:51] going on in heaven
[43:55] because the Tabernacle of God is with
[43:57] men
[43:58] verse 3
[44:00] and we we read that already the
[44:02] Tabernacle of God is with men verse 4
[44:05] and God
[44:07] shall wipe away
[44:09] some of the tears from their eyes
[44:15] they're going to weep some tears and
[44:17] then
[44:18] and he's just going to wipe you know one
[44:20] out of ten up no the Bible says he's
[44:22] going to wipe all tears from their eyes
[44:26] and there shall be no more death
[44:28] neither sorrow
[44:30] nor crying
[44:32] neither shall there be any more pain
[44:35] for the former things are passed away
[44:39] he's talking about the things we're
[44:41] going through now the former things are
[44:45] passed away and he that sat upon the
[44:47] throne
[44:48] said behold I make all things new
[44:52] and he said unto me right for these
[44:54] words are true and faithful when we look
[44:58] at verse 4 about God wiping all tears
[45:02] from their eyes
[45:04] and there shall be no more death
[45:07] neither sorrow
[45:09] nor crying neither shall there be any
[45:12] more pain
[45:13] that's not just physical pain
[45:16] it's also emotional pain
[45:19] it's also pains that come from your
[45:21] memory of things that have happened in
[45:23] your past
[45:24] God bless you tonight as you have your
[45:27] seats
[45:29] what was the same word tonight in all
[45:33] three of these verses
[45:37] what is the emphasis why would the Lord
[45:39] lay this on brother John's heart to come
[45:42] all the way from America and speak in
[45:45] this little church tonight on Shekinah
[45:47] Tabernacle of all the hundreds or
[45:49] thousands of sermons
[45:51] that would we could have spoke that he
[45:54] would emphasize this word sorrow then it
[45:58] must be for someone tonight
[46:00] I believe he's a personal God and
[46:03] he'll do that for you
[46:05] I want to announce tonight a great
[46:06] announcement tonight we are going to a
[46:09] land where there is no more sorrow
[46:15] I'll just announce it again amen we're
[46:17] going to a land where there is no more
[46:19] sorrow
[46:22] if you look back maybe in the past week
[46:24] of your life
[46:26] maybe even the past month or the months
[46:29] or years of your life there's been
[46:31] sorrow for you
[46:34] maybe you've heard stories about other
[46:36] people's lives that cause a sorrow maybe
[46:39] it's not personal to you but you hear
[46:42] about others that's lost a loved one or
[46:44] someone's passed away and it causes
[46:46] sorrow
[46:47] you hear on the news things going on in
[46:50] Ukraine and you know hospitals being hit
[46:53] or you know things being people
[46:55] suffering with no electricity or
[46:57] innocent children women being hurt or
[47:00] raped or murdered young people children
[47:03] families being broken and it causes
[47:06] sorrow
[47:08] clashes in China with the police and
[47:11] covid restrictions and all these things
[47:13] people all over the world I think you
[47:15] went through some months of covet and
[47:17] things here in New Zealand and it causes
[47:19] pain
[47:21] it causes suffering
[47:23] it causes isolation and a person
[47:25] wondering why and why is all this
[47:28] happening maybe why did it happen to me
[47:32] so what is sorrow tonight are you all
[47:35] doing okay I I know your pastor and
[47:37] brother brother Andy are gone but y'all
[47:39] can still be alive and or or maybe I
[47:42] just came down so close to home I'm
[47:44] touching a nerve maybe I'm doing that
[47:46] tonight is that right
[47:49] so no more sorrow so what is sorrow
[47:53] if it's actually so great of us
[47:55] something that it's not going to be
[47:56] there in heaven then what it is what is
[47:59] it
[48:00] sorrow is pain that comes from a past
[48:03] event in your life that triggers
[48:06] in the inside of a person certain
[48:09] responses
[48:10] it triggers things and almost always
[48:13] it's negative
[48:15] sorrow is negative
[48:18] and sorrow what is sorrow is we speak of
[48:22] Sorrow it is sadness
[48:24] it is a Mourning as we read in the
[48:27] scriptures there'll be no more sorrow or
[48:29] Mourning that could be inward mourning
[48:32] or sadness but it could be something
[48:34] that's just on the outside like it's
[48:36] just so great of a sorrow in your heart
[48:40] it just comes through your eyes and it
[48:42] causes tears sorrow can be caused by
[48:45] disappointments that happen in your life
[48:48] it can come from challenging events that
[48:50] you're going through and you know God
[48:52] Made You human how many know that
[48:55] tonight I I think most of you are human
[48:57] that I'm speaking to We're Not Angels
[48:59] we're not seraphims you know God Made
[49:02] You human and it's not immoral to be
[49:05] human
[49:07] it's not immoral to have sadness
[49:11] you're not an evil person because you
[49:14] have sorrow
[49:16] that's something that God Made You in
[49:18] response to things that you're going
[49:20] through sometimes it can be emotional
[49:23] hurt
[49:24] it can be a loss of something
[49:27] it can be loss of someone in your life
[49:29] when I say a loss of something it could
[49:31] be a loss of virtue or a loss of of
[49:35] something that was given to you and it
[49:37] was taken away I you all sang the song
[49:39] tonight we have a father who will never
[49:42] leave you and he'll never leave you and
[49:44] brother John has dealt with a lot of
[49:46] young people and children in my life and
[49:48] there's nothing that is more harder for
[49:51] a young person to go through than the
[49:53] loss of a father or the loss of a mother
[49:56] and divorce or in separation and to have
[49:59] a father walk out on a young lady or to
[50:03] have a young lady deal with the loss of
[50:05] a father or the rejection of a father or
[50:08] maybe he's present but he's absent in
[50:11] spirit and he doesn't give her the
[50:13] emotional strength the worst thing that
[50:15] can happen for a young man is a rebuke
[50:18] of his father and to sell for a young
[50:20] man to hear from a father that he's no
[50:23] good well he'll never amount to nothing
[50:25] it causes sorrow it causes pain it's
[50:29] nothing like to have a father walk out
[50:31] on a family and it just the rejection in
[50:34] the morning even with the Holy Ghost you
[50:37] can see there's a lot of weight and
[50:38] sorrow on people how many know what I'm
[50:40] talking about it but to hear those songs
[50:42] he'll never leave you and he'll never
[50:45] forsake you or he'll never leave you
[50:47] alone
[50:48] ought to give you a lot of confidence
[50:49] tonight that no matter what you're going
[50:52] through that the Lord Jesus is with you
[50:55] sorrow is something where you've lost
[50:57] something in your life and all of us
[51:00] were born with our old natures and we
[51:02] were bent negative we were bit negative
[51:06] you know there's natural things that
[51:08] happen and people can tell us just the
[51:10] world would tell us that we can do
[51:12] better when we have sorrow they to
[51:14] alleviate the effects of Sorrow this
[51:17] isn't just from the scripture or the
[51:19] word but it can be the world tells you
[51:21] you know that you can speak to a close
[51:23] friend about your sorrow they say you
[51:25] can you know avoid whatever factors
[51:28] causing you to be in sorrow have a
[51:30] balanced diet you know exercise more
[51:32] regularly get more
[51:34] adequate sleep and things or occupy your
[51:37] life with more positive things that's
[51:40] just what the world would say if you're
[51:42] full of Sorrow tonight but I believe for
[51:44] the Believers there should be more of a
[51:47] spiritual response
[51:49] I believe for us there can be more of an
[51:52] eternal response that is not just short
[51:55] term but it's more long-term that we can
[51:59] be touched by the master that the Lord
[52:01] Jesus can actually tell us who we are
[52:04] and that we're Sons and Daughters of his
[52:06] and that there's a long-term Vision
[52:09] there's a long-range plan for us that's
[52:12] beyond the pain
[52:14] I think you're hearing that tonight I I
[52:17] think you're hearing the words even the
[52:19] few scriptures that we read that we are
[52:22] going to a place maybe I'll just go back
[52:24] and show you where there is no more
[52:26] sorrow and a place where I'll sign shall
[52:29] flee away
[52:31] I'm in how many's ever lost your joy
[52:36] or lost your peace
[52:38] well I'm we just read a scripture where
[52:41] sorrow and sighing are going to be
[52:43] fleeing away
[52:45] you're not going to lose your joy you're
[52:46] not going to lose your happiness you're
[52:48] not going to lose your strength but but
[52:50] you're actually going to lose your
[52:52] sorrow
[52:53] and your days of Sorrow could be a
[52:55] mother that just signed just because of
[52:57] the burdens of having a family or a
[52:59] brother that that is trying to make ends
[53:02] meet or make a living and you're you
[53:03] feel rejected even in the country of New
[53:07] Zealand you can feel rejected well we're
[53:09] going to a place where sorrow and
[53:11] mourning shall flee away
[53:13] when you don't feel like a failure I
[53:16] mean even the best among us we feel like
[53:18] failures oftentimes but we're going to a
[53:21] place that's already been paid for and I
[53:24] don't want to just speaking all about in
[53:26] the future I believe there's Heavenly
[53:27] places that we can come into with Christ
[53:30] that he will he can wipe away all tears
[53:33] from our eyes and let us know that even
[53:35] when we're though we're going through a
[53:37] time of sorrow and pain that he can wipe
[53:40] away those tears but we are going to a
[53:44] place where there shall be no more death
[53:47] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[53:51] there be any more pain for the former
[53:54] things are passed away
[53:57] brother John was just in the eastern
[53:59] part of Canada a few weeks ago and I
[54:01] took this photo right by the ocean
[54:04] and I I just wanted to share it with you
[54:06] along with the the things that we're
[54:09] speaking about tonight and things that
[54:11] are to be just notice the the date there
[54:14] in December I see some of you writing
[54:16] notes tonight that's very good this is
[54:18] one of brother branham's last messages
[54:20] on things that are to be
[54:22] he says we build a hospital ever so good
[54:25] and practice with the best medicine that
[54:28] we got and thousands die in it daily but
[54:32] oh my in the kingdom of God there is no
[54:35] death
[54:37] there is no sorrow
[54:40] amen there's no need of these things of
[54:42] the world
[54:44] but we've passed from this thing let's
[54:46] say this thing
[54:48] into the realities of God
[54:51] where we struggle so hard to try to find
[54:55] through science and the more scientific
[54:57] we get the more death we bring on
[54:59] ourselves we're fighting a losing battle
[55:01] there so turn loose of it
[55:05] turn loose of it
[55:08] and by faith believe Jesus Christ the
[55:11] son of God tonight and accept him he is
[55:16] the one
[55:17] somebody say praise the Lord
[55:19] [Music]
[55:21] you're full of Sorrow when you lose
[55:24] something
[55:26] you're full of Sorrow when something is
[55:29] opposite
[55:30] then the way you think it ought to be it
[55:33] just is not happening right you feel
[55:35] sorrow
[55:37] when there's a memory of your past
[55:41] and it's just like a Pang of something
[55:43] comes through your heart that's called
[55:45] sorrow
[55:46] I trust this is helping somebody tonight
[55:49] something happened to you
[55:52] someone said something
[55:55] and that could have been days ago or
[55:57] weeks or years ago but it stays in your
[55:59] memory it stays in your heart
[56:02] Satan uses those things to make you feel
[56:05] unworthy and make you feel dirty even if
[56:09] it wasn't your fault even if it was your
[56:12] fault I'm I'm going I'm going there
[56:14] tonight
[56:15] if it wasn't your fault and somebody
[56:17] took advantage of you and you just feel
[56:20] dirty you feel full of Sorrow God's here
[56:23] tonight to let you know he cares about
[56:25] you I feel uh Pastor Freddie that's why
[56:30] God would bring a brother from America
[56:31] all the way to New Zealand on a Tuesday
[56:34] night meeting is to tell one of his
[56:36] sheep that that I care for you and I
[56:39] love you heaven and the minister isn't
[56:42] here to take away your past he's here to
[56:45] give you uh the the word and God's
[56:47] presence and for the Lord to come into
[56:49] these meetings
[56:50] to be able to deal with your past and I
[56:53] can't take away your past but we can
[56:55] certainly allow the Lord Jesus to deal
[56:58] with what someone said about you
[57:01] it was so negative and it was wrong and
[57:04] may I'm sorry that you even feel the way
[57:07] that you do to bring sorrow
[57:12] I think sometimes we need to have that
[57:15] in our services where we say I'm sorry
[57:17] more
[57:18] instead of thinking like we got it all
[57:20] together and we're so strong and
[57:23] and we're so great Christians and we got
[57:26] a deep Revelation well maybe we need to
[57:29] be more honest and say I'm sorry I'm
[57:32] really sorry that you were hurt today
[57:34] I'm really sorry that you went to work
[57:36] today and felt that that trouble
[57:39] I'm sorry that what happened in that
[57:41] school room or in that locker room that
[57:44] somebody said something that hurt you
[57:46] I'm really sorry
[57:48] now you say oh preacher you know oh you
[57:51] don't even know what you're talking
[57:52] about I feel like the Lord's talking to
[57:54] somebody tonight whatever happened to
[57:56] you maybe it was in a church somewhere
[57:58] maybe it was an uncle somewhere I just
[58:00] prayed for a young lady this week that
[58:02] was afraid and something was going on in
[58:04] her family and she was all alone and her
[58:07] uncle was doing inappropriate things to
[58:09] with her and I just say God help that
[58:11] person and strengthen them because it
[58:14] brings a lot of Sorrow
[58:16] life is full of Sorrow
[58:18] and we have to have a place of release
[58:21] I'm not speaking tonight about just some
[58:23] land beyond the river I I don't believe
[58:25] all of it should be over there I believe
[58:28] while we're here and while we're while
[58:30] we're in this pail of Sorrow while we're
[58:33] going through the valley while we're
[58:34] trying to turn the corner on this
[58:37] journey of life and on your tracks and
[58:39] on your journey that the Lord Jesus can
[58:41] can give you strength
[58:43] it can speak a word to you
[58:47] our lives are full of Sorrow
[58:51] I want to ask you a question tonight do
[58:54] you think there will be sorrow in heaven
[58:59] do you think that there'll be sorrow in
[59:01] heaven
[59:02] the answer is no
[59:04] there won't be no sorrow in heaven
[59:08] God knows about what we are going
[59:10] through in this life and not not all of
[59:13] our life are we going to be strong
[59:15] now all of our life are we going to feel
[59:17] like we've got it all together
[59:20] God comes to us at Seasons in our lives
[59:22] to let us know in the things of God and
[59:25] I really believe the words of God and
[59:28] our camp meetings and our midweek
[59:30] services our Sunday services our home
[59:32] lives
[59:35] should be opportunities to Bear ye one
[59:37] another's burdens
[59:39] do you all believe that
[59:43] let's read sometimes we kind of brush
[59:45] over these things what brother Branham
[59:47] said before this quote of in the kingdom
[59:50] of God There Is No Death there is no
[59:52] sorrow what did he say before that and
[59:54] what did he say after that can I preach
[59:57] to you tonight
[59:58] our schools and things are a blow up
[1:00:01] as God never said go forth and make
[1:00:03] schools or even have Bible schools you
[1:00:06] know that
[1:00:07] it's kind of amazing brother Bradham
[1:00:09] would speak negatively about Bible
[1:00:11] schools yet he sent his son to one
[1:00:15] did you all know that
[1:00:17] Billy Paul was a in the prophet's home
[1:00:20] and he was smoking cigarettes
[1:00:22] 14 years old and 15 years old brother
[1:00:25] Billy Paul was smoking cigarettes
[1:00:28] in a prophet's home
[1:00:30] and when brother brownham heard about
[1:00:32] that and when the angel of the Lord
[1:00:33] revealed it to him he sent him down to
[1:00:36] Waxahachie Texas which was about 16
[1:00:39] hours away down from Jeffersonville to
[1:00:41] Texas to go to a Bible school that's
[1:00:44] where we met brother Perry green and
[1:00:46] other people that knew brother Billy
[1:00:48] Paul or brother Branham he would speak
[1:00:49] about Bible schools maybe you would say
[1:00:51] that's negative but he actually sent his
[1:00:54] own son there and he wanted his daughter
[1:00:55] sister Rebecca to go to a Bible School
[1:00:58] Ashbury College in in Kentucky
[1:01:01] but brother Branham said uh he never
[1:01:04] said to have Bible schools and things
[1:01:05] but he said preach the word that's what
[1:01:08] I'm doing tonight amen that's exactly
[1:01:10] right our educational system's taking us
[1:01:13] farther away from God than anything I
[1:01:15] know of that's right further away from
[1:01:18] God not build schools and hospitals and
[1:01:21] so forth that's for the world and for
[1:01:23] that group I ain't got nothing against
[1:01:25] them
[1:01:26] but they play their parts that still is
[1:01:29] not that yeah we built a hospital ever
[1:01:31] so good in practice with the best
[1:01:33] medicine we got and thousands die in it
[1:01:35] daily but oh my in the kingdom of God
[1:01:38] there is no death
[1:01:40] there is no sorrow
[1:01:43] is brother Branham saying if you're in
[1:01:46] the kingdom of God you won't have sorrow
[1:01:49] is he saying if you're a believer that
[1:01:52] you won't have sorrow that's not what
[1:01:53] he's saying he's talking about the
[1:01:55] kingdom of God which I believe we're a
[1:01:57] part of so spiritually but also the
[1:02:00] kingdom of God that we're going to There
[1:02:02] Is No Death
[1:02:03] it's even implying that if you're a
[1:02:05] believer that you won't die or there's
[1:02:07] no death or no sorrow no that's not what
[1:02:10] he's saying we we call it going to sleep
[1:02:12] but in the kingdom of God there is no
[1:02:15] death
[1:02:16] there is no sorrow what is he talking
[1:02:18] about Brother John
[1:02:20] when he says in the kingdom of God There
[1:02:22] Is No Death there is no sorrow there's
[1:02:25] no need of these things of the world we
[1:02:27] passed him this thing into the realities
[1:02:29] of God where we struggle so hard to try
[1:02:33] to find through science and the more
[1:02:35] scientific we get the more death we
[1:02:37] bring on ourselves we're fighting a
[1:02:39] losing battle there so turn loose of it
[1:02:41] and by faith believe Jesus Christ the
[1:02:44] son of God tonight and accept him he is
[1:02:48] the one
[1:02:49] now friends we need to be more sensitive
[1:02:51] with one another sometimes we need more
[1:02:53] than just a Band-Aid in our church
[1:02:55] services
[1:02:57] we're coming into some camp meetings
[1:02:59] thank you brother
[1:03:02] Cuban
[1:03:03] is that how you say it Cuban did I say
[1:03:06] it okay I'll talk South African hey man
[1:03:08] I'll get bad by the end of this week
[1:03:10] I'll talk Afrikaans and
[1:03:15] when we get together like this we need
[1:03:17] to realize that it's more than just a
[1:03:20] little Band-Aid what people need
[1:03:21] sometimes
[1:03:23] you might be sitting on a row with
[1:03:25] someone or a person might be in the room
[1:03:27] or come to the camp
[1:03:29] that really needs a heart surgery
[1:03:32] they need a heart transplant
[1:03:35] it might take more than just an evening
[1:03:37] service or a morning service it might
[1:03:40] take a few services
[1:03:42] and we need to be sensitive about that
[1:03:43] we we need to be sensitive about the
[1:03:46] waiting room be sensitive that we need
[1:03:49] to wait on one another that's part of
[1:03:51] communion Paul taught the Believers to
[1:03:53] wait on one another and we need to
[1:03:56] realize people are going through issues
[1:03:58] there's things that people go through in
[1:04:00] life and I'm not talking about just
[1:04:02] young people you say oh that's a young
[1:04:04] people's issue no we got old people that
[1:04:07] that have issues
[1:04:09] we got ministers wives that need help
[1:04:12] we got deacons and trustees and and
[1:04:16] helpers that need the Lord
[1:04:18] We're All in This Together
[1:04:21] like we're a bunch of people from a lot
[1:04:23] of different countries it's all been
[1:04:24] thrown in this together we're making
[1:04:27] Heaven our home but we need to be really
[1:04:30] serious sometimes and realize that we
[1:04:32] got to give each other room to to grow
[1:04:34] through this and break through some of
[1:04:36] these things come on tonight friends we
[1:04:39] got to be willing to wait in the waiting
[1:04:41] room
[1:04:42] and not just
[1:04:46] but like learn to get in the waiting
[1:04:48] room and like get desperate and get in
[1:04:50] prayer and hold up one another and bear
[1:04:53] you one another's burdens and
[1:04:56] we need the Lord Jesus to move greater
[1:04:59] than ever before
[1:05:01] in fact I'll just say it the way it is
[1:05:03] you know I think you'd agree that we
[1:05:05] need the Lord Jesus at this Family Camp
[1:05:07] more than ever before we we don't want
[1:05:10] to just be having meetings we want the
[1:05:12] Lord to come down
[1:05:13] so what is science preparing for you
[1:05:16] more death
[1:05:18] but yet most of us are going to drive
[1:05:20] cars to the camp
[1:05:22] we flew on an airplane today
[1:05:25] it's a lot quicker I was telling brother
[1:05:27] Freddie it's a lot quicker than riding a
[1:05:29] mule down here
[1:05:31] from Auckland to Wellington we got here
[1:05:33] in an hour
[1:05:34] it's a lot quicker than a mule
[1:05:37] or a donkey
[1:05:41] or a camel or riding a bicycle I'm glad
[1:05:45] for that and tomorrow we're going to fly
[1:05:47] back and be preaching in another place
[1:05:49] tomorrow night I'm glad for these
[1:05:51] airplanes
[1:05:53] but it's not going to be an airplane
[1:05:54] that gets us in the rapture
[1:05:56] it's not your jeans or your shirt or
[1:05:59] your nice dress or your hair that's
[1:06:02] going to get you over this pain and
[1:06:04] sorrow you can be looking the part and
[1:06:06] yet there be something going on we need
[1:06:09] the Lord we we need his hand we need his
[1:06:13] foot his Footprints to walk by your way
[1:06:16] and his fingerprint on your life
[1:06:19] I want it Lord Jesus
[1:06:22] all these sputniks and everything going
[1:06:25] up in all these things to scatter death
[1:06:27] and everything across the Earth don't
[1:06:29] look to that
[1:06:32] can I be honest with y'all I think
[1:06:35] there's a World Cup going on football
[1:06:36] foot soccer whatever we need to don't
[1:06:39] look to those things
[1:06:42] Sports and Hollywood and whatever your
[1:06:44] job and your salaries and we look to how
[1:06:47] we dress or you know how we live and
[1:06:49] what kind of shoes we wear don't look to
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:54] turn your head higher than that towards
[1:06:57] heaven look to where Jesus sits on the
[1:06:59] right hand of God tonight every living
[1:07:02] to make intercessions on our confession
[1:07:05] oh of what we believe his word to
[1:07:08] believe the truth to be the truth how
[1:07:10] many believe his word is the truth
[1:07:11] tonight
[1:07:14] the atmosphere that we choose to live in
[1:07:18] the positive music and the things the
[1:07:21] people that were around how we treat one
[1:07:23] another is very important
[1:07:27] what goes on in our life and what what
[1:07:29] is plugged into your life is going to
[1:07:31] come out of your life
[1:07:33] so we need to be plugged into Christ
[1:07:35] plugged into his word because it will
[1:07:38] come out of his friends
[1:07:40] whatever we're plugged into and we have
[1:07:42] a responsibility even tonight we have a
[1:07:45] sacred responsibility to Christ we have
[1:07:48] a sacred responsibility to respond to
[1:07:51] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:53] and brother Branham talked about this as
[1:07:55] one of his last messages there in
[1:07:57] Shreveport Louisiana the invisible union
[1:08:00] he talked about these things what a
[1:08:03] sacred trust what a responsibility to a
[1:08:06] woman
[1:08:06] we see why she's a type of the church
[1:08:09] which has the same responsibility
[1:08:13] as a woman as a sacred responsibility to
[1:08:16] her motherhood to her virtues to her
[1:08:19] husband
[1:08:21] the church has a sacred responsibility
[1:08:25] to prayer
[1:08:27] let's all say prayer
[1:08:29] to the word
[1:08:31] and to Christ
[1:08:34] none of that has anything to do with the
[1:08:37] preacher or what church you go to or the
[1:08:41] instrument sir the song leader
[1:08:44] we have a sacred responsibility to
[1:08:47] prayer
[1:08:49] how you doing tonight in there
[1:08:52] to the word
[1:08:56] Antichrist
[1:08:57] we need to look to him turn away from
[1:09:00] your sorrow
[1:09:02] turn away from your pain
[1:09:04] we all have pain we all have suffering
[1:09:06] we all have things that have happened
[1:09:08] that we regret or we wish would have
[1:09:11] never happened we wish we could take it
[1:09:13] away and put an eraser on and I'm not
[1:09:16] belittling your issue I'm not I'm not
[1:09:18] speaking about it
[1:09:20] um lightly to mean that we're not
[1:09:22] bearing bearing it with you but I'm here
[1:09:24] to encourage you to may God give you the
[1:09:27] strength to look Beyond those things and
[1:09:29] you have a responsibility your whole
[1:09:31] life from now to the Future to prayer
[1:09:35] and to the word and to Christ we have a
[1:09:38] responsibility for those things
[1:09:40] when there's a loss can I go on just a
[1:09:42] few more minutes maybe this is helping
[1:09:45] somebody tonight
[1:09:46] there we have a loss of a family member
[1:09:49] and death it causes sorrow
[1:09:52] maybe you lose a friend
[1:09:55] somebody that's been a friend to you in
[1:09:58] a relationship
[1:10:00] you know guys and girls girls and guys
[1:10:03] and you can get rejected by someone or
[1:10:06] something
[1:10:07] it can be a very hurtful thing it can be
[1:10:09] a very traumatic thing in relationships
[1:10:14] well y'all are really quiet right there
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:18] there can be situations that's going on
[1:10:20] in Old Wounds and failures
[1:10:23] and misunderstandings that have happened
[1:10:25] and it really hurts you and causes you
[1:10:28] sorrow you can put a smile on and kind
[1:10:31] of look the part but when you turn away
[1:10:34] your heart is just like a dagger's there
[1:10:38] I'm putting a word on it tonight for you
[1:10:40] it's called sorrow
[1:10:43] and you're not weird
[1:10:44] and you're not an odd person
[1:10:47] and you're not strange because you bear
[1:10:49] that it's called sorrow
[1:10:52] humans have sorrow but aren't you
[1:10:54] thankful tonight at the scriptures that
[1:10:56] we read and what we're hearing that
[1:10:58] we're going to a land where there is no
[1:11:00] more sorrow
[1:11:02] all that's going to be taken away all
[1:11:05] the sign all the crying all the pain all
[1:11:08] the Death all the separation
[1:11:11] there's no job there's no time clock
[1:11:13] there there's no you know there's no
[1:11:16] Dole there there's no you know weekly
[1:11:18] rent due there's no monthly rent due I
[1:11:21] mean how much you're going to pay for
[1:11:22] your future home have you ever thought
[1:11:24] about that
[1:11:26] hmm
[1:11:30] it's like those guys that showed up to
[1:11:31] the Pearly Gates and they had a bunch of
[1:11:33] block bars in their backpacks and
[1:11:35] they're carrying all these burdens of of
[1:11:37] gold and everything and they're gold and
[1:11:39] they wanted to bring their gold to
[1:11:40] heaven and the angels kind of laughing
[1:11:42] and chuckling a little bit look at those
[1:11:44] guys you know they'll say what are you
[1:11:45] talking about it well the angel said
[1:11:47] what are you bringing these blocks of
[1:11:48] gold here for and all these things you
[1:11:50] got in your backpack you don't need that
[1:11:52] what are you talking about that you know
[1:11:55] the streets are paved with that stuff
[1:11:57] here
[1:11:58] streets are paying for the golden
[1:11:59] people's always working for money and
[1:12:02] working for gold and working for
[1:12:04] trophies and and the angels they're just
[1:12:06] kind of looking and saying what are you
[1:12:07] doing that for the streets are paved
[1:12:09] with gold up here that's what we drive
[1:12:11] around on up here if they I don't know
[1:12:13] driving around in heaven but I'm just
[1:12:15] saying the streets are paved with gold
[1:12:18] all the diamonds and things people want
[1:12:20] to flash their Rings you know and show
[1:12:22] how rich they are well you know all the
[1:12:25] jewels and all those things you know I
[1:12:27] mean your future home is it worth 20 000
[1:12:31] a month in heaven
[1:12:33] you'll never be able to afford that
[1:12:38] some of you just need to learn to accept
[1:12:40] gifts when God gives it to you and just
[1:12:42] say Lord I know I'm not worthy I'm not
[1:12:44] going to try to live the rest of my life
[1:12:46] in some Works program I just receive it
[1:12:49] Lord
[1:12:50] I receive you Jesus
[1:12:55] sometimes it can go from feeling on top
[1:12:57] of the world just on top of it
[1:13:00] and in a matter of seconds you just feel
[1:13:02] like you're at the bottom
[1:13:05] you can just feel like so fantastic and
[1:13:08] euphoric so wonderful and then within
[1:13:10] the matter of seconds be like on the
[1:13:12] bottom that doesn't mean you don't have
[1:13:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:16] it doesn't mean you're a bad person
[1:13:18] but you cannot live your life in
[1:13:21] constant sorrow
[1:13:23] I'm going to say some things to help you
[1:13:25] you cannot let sorrow destroy your life
[1:13:30] you can't let sorrow continue make you
[1:13:32] miserable all the time and you need to
[1:13:34] stop living fake all the time say well
[1:13:37] then I'm going to be miserable in front
[1:13:39] of everybody and I'm going to let my
[1:13:40] depression rule my linear that's not
[1:13:43] right either you're talking the devil's
[1:13:45] language
[1:13:47] you can't live your life in constant
[1:13:49] sorrow
[1:13:51] pain can't be your leader
[1:13:54] the Lord Jesus is your leader
[1:13:56] but brokenheartedness is a real thing
[1:13:59] you that no medical fields that you can
[1:14:02] actually die of a broken heart they say
[1:14:04] Jesus died of a broken heart it's
[1:14:07] actually a medical term how many know
[1:14:08] that you can die of a broken heart I
[1:14:11] just heard of it in the last few days uh
[1:14:14] someone's spouse passed away and within
[1:14:17] months the sister passed away and what
[1:14:19] it was you know they just had lived
[1:14:21] their whole lives together and they're
[1:14:22] just mold they just can't they just
[1:14:24] can't hardly do anything without their
[1:14:26] spouse
[1:14:28] some of us need to do that spiritually
[1:14:31] so I can't even live a day without you I
[1:14:33] mean Lord where are you in my life
[1:14:36] I need you Lord where'd you go God
[1:14:39] maybe there's camp meetings whether Esau
[1:14:42] will be a moment that we can cry out to
[1:14:44] God and that God can restore back to
[1:14:46] people and give back to them that all
[1:14:49] the years that can that it can come from
[1:14:51] a verse in the Bible in Joel I will
[1:14:54] restore all the years
[1:14:56] that God could take years of sorrow and
[1:14:59] pour back in joy and pour back in peace
[1:15:02] somebody would receive that in the name
[1:15:03] of the Lord
[1:15:04] stop putting it as a verse in the Bible
[1:15:07] or something in your house a little
[1:15:09] slogan you know something on your
[1:15:10] refrigerator say God put it in my Heart
[1:15:13] Lord
[1:15:14] God I'm sitting there with my hearts
[1:15:16] broken I'm full of Sorrow why why did
[1:15:19] this happen in my life and you sometimes
[1:15:22] God doesn't answer our questions the way
[1:15:24] that we feel yada but he just does
[1:15:26] something for you and as you mature in
[1:15:29] Christ you look back and you see it's
[1:15:31] not always that he's taken the burden
[1:15:33] away he's given me strength to Bear the
[1:15:35] burden
[1:15:37] have you learned that
[1:15:39] sometimes he doesn't take away the storm
[1:15:42] he gives you strength to go through the
[1:15:44] storm
[1:15:48] how many know that a hurricane
[1:15:50] a hurricane can be so destructive but
[1:15:53] right in the middle of A hurricane's the
[1:15:54] eye
[1:15:56] how many know that there's the eye of a
[1:15:58] hurricane it's just calm there it's
[1:16:00] peace
[1:16:01] actually the sun can shine right down
[1:16:03] through the middle of a hurricane it's
[1:16:06] called the eye of the hurricane
[1:16:08] and right around it within feet it can
[1:16:10] just be shaking and violent violent
[1:16:14] violent emotions and feelings are like
[1:16:17] this and that and then
[1:16:19] just come into a place of peace
[1:16:22] and they have airplanes the Navy has
[1:16:24] airplanes that fly into those how many
[1:16:27] know what I'm talking about and they
[1:16:28] they actually fly right into hurricanes
[1:16:30] and they're shaking and moving and you
[1:16:32] can see this and why and you can see
[1:16:34] pilot and they're all strapped in the
[1:16:35] things are going everywhere you wouldn't
[1:16:37] want to have your coffee sitting over
[1:16:38] there be all over the place and then
[1:16:40] it'll be just shaking and like every
[1:16:42] every boat on this thing is just shaking
[1:16:46] and rivets just my if you're loose

[1:16:50] or maybe you ever felt like you're going
[1:16:52] crazy oh God I feel like I'm going crazy
[1:16:54] and then all of a sudden it'll come
[1:16:58] and it's just peace
[1:17:01] peace I could show you pictures tonight
[1:17:03] and they the Sun's shining right down in
[1:17:06] the middle of this eye of the storm
[1:17:09] it's like the lovely Lord Jesus he gives
[1:17:12] you he gives you peace in the midst of
[1:17:14] the storm
[1:17:16] you've heard that before peace in the
[1:17:18] midst of the stormy say I want this
[1:17:21] storm to leave in the name of Jesus I
[1:17:23] want this storm and God says nope I'm

[1:25:45] I'm talking your language there's always
[1:25:48] sisters that are just always
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:53] and down inside they're like being all
[1:25:55] tore up and if you really saw the real

[1:26:03] everything to be perfect I don't know
[1:26:05] where you're living at but perfect is
[1:26:08] not a sinless Perfection it's mature
[1:26:11] that means we've learned to to Bear the
[1:26:13] infirmities of the week
[1:26:15] with the poor you have with you always
[1:26:18] that's what Jesus said
[1:26:20] poor financially poor in spirit blessed
[1:26:24] are the poor in spirit
[1:26:26] I think I'm going to speak a whole
[1:26:28] message at the camp I'm blessed are the
[1:26:30] poor
[1:26:31] because we all we all want to think that
[1:26:33] oh a certain status is a certain thing
[1:26:38] and it's not that blessed are the poor
[1:26:42] you're blessed if you're poor
[1:26:45] oh wow I've never done it up before I
[1:26:48] never heard nobody preach on that before
[1:26:49] well maybe that's why people aren't
[1:26:51] happy that's poor you gotta say I'm
[1:26:54] blessed because I'm poor most of God's
[1:26:57] people are poor
[1:26:59] I better move along amen well that's
[1:27:02] what Jesus said
[1:27:04] maybe you you're not understanding it
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:06] there will be sicknesses there will be
[1:27:08] reversals
[1:27:09] but our anchor is not in those things
[1:27:11] it's in the Lord Jesus
[1:27:13] our identity is not in what others did
[1:27:16] to you or what others think of you or
[1:27:18] your failures or your faults or your
[1:27:21] weaknesses that's the outer man we're
[1:27:24] not identified by those things our hope
[1:27:27] is in the Lord
[1:27:28] from this time on forevermore
[1:27:34] say what am I supposed to do brother
[1:27:36] John I'm going to keep pressing on
[1:27:40] I'm gonna put one foot in front of the
[1:27:42] other and the Lord Jesus is going to
[1:27:44] give me strength
[1:27:47] tonight I'm interceding with you I'm
[1:27:49] groaning for your good
[1:27:51] I'm groaning all creation is groaning
[1:27:54] for you to come to your perfection in
[1:27:57] spite of the sorrow
[1:27:58] God's heart still beats inside of you
[1:28:03] and what happens in many people's lives
[1:28:05] brother Branham said it like this I saw
[1:28:07] it the other day he's talking about the
[1:28:09] way people dress and things and women
[1:28:11] and all these things he said the love of
[1:28:14] God has leaked out of your heart
[1:28:18] that's incredible
[1:28:20] the love of God has leaked out of your
[1:28:23] heart there's been a crack in your life
[1:28:25] somewhere
[1:28:26] and the oil is just sapping out all over
[1:28:28] the waters the water's flowing brother
[1:28:32] it's flowing by the meetings we've had
[1:28:34] in my the music and my the preaching I
[1:28:36] just but then it just leaks right out
[1:28:38] and by Tuesday and by Wednesday by the

[1:28:56] hold that and you can give oil and wine

[1:55:42] how many believe the word tonight
[1:55:44] amen I believe the Lord started a good
[1:55:46] word
[1:55:47] for the last two and a half years we
[1:55:50] have been in a certain relationship
[1:55:55] and Cove had brought it about it was
[1:55:58] something that happened and then we were
[1:56:00] able to meet some of you and know some
[1:56:02] of you online and on zoom and YouTube
[1:56:04] and I was able to see
[1:56:06] hundreds and thousands of people in the
[1:56:09] last two and a half years
[1:56:11] face to face it was just through a
[1:56:14] screen a lot of times I would be all
[1:56:15] alone with just a few Brothers in the
[1:56:19] room and I was able to minister to you
[1:56:22] and many others and I looked into your
[1:56:23] faces and I could see throughout all
[1:56:26] these months and I could see the Holy
[1:56:29] Spirit working and even tonight you know
[1:56:31] when you're looking at someone's face
[1:56:33] and
[1:56:34] I just want you to know that the Lord
[1:56:37] Jesus is mindful of you
[1:56:39] tonight we came a little early and was
[1:56:42] in the fellowship meal and our brother
[1:56:45] what's your name brother
[1:56:47] Matthew was given me the testimony
[1:56:50] further Brother David because I was
[1:56:52] streaming his testimony at the youth
[1:56:54] services and I could see the Lord had
[1:56:56] really done a work in David's life and
[1:56:58] and our brother was
[1:57:01] giving expression of because he knew our
[1:57:04] brother before and he saw him during and
[1:57:06] he sees him now and I want you to know
[1:57:09] that the work of the Lord he just keeps
[1:57:11] his hand on you
[1:57:13] and we never want to just give up on God
[1:57:15] but we don't want him to give up on us
[1:57:19] and that situation and then we started
[1:57:22] to stream your services and stream your
[1:57:23] meetings and now I know you
[1:57:26] and now Brother David and I was I was
[1:57:28] connected to that service and then our
[1:57:30] brother comes and says he saw that in
[1:57:33] his life and the change well I want to
[1:57:36] see that in others
[1:57:37] and this week I believe the Lord's going
[1:57:39] to keep working and he's going to keep
[1:57:42] delivering and he just puts his arm
[1:57:44] around people and people that were
[1:57:46] backslidden and people that can be far
[1:57:48] away from God and doing doing horrible
[1:57:51] things
[1:57:52] but they can come into an atmosphere of
[1:57:54] the word and come into a servicer come
[1:57:57] into a Tuesday night meeting or come
[1:57:59] into a family camp or coming to your
[1:58:02] living room
[1:58:05] into your bedroom
[1:58:09] my son-in-law that you saw the photo of
[1:58:11] he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:58:13] when he was all alone
[1:58:15] wasn't out of service it wasn't at a
[1:58:17] meeting it wasn't a camp service or a
[1:58:20] youth meeting
[1:58:21] I'm going to give you more testimonies
[1:58:23] this week of other young people and
[1:58:25] people that the Lord filled them with
[1:58:27] the Holy Ghost in an after service
[1:58:30] how many know what an after service is
[1:58:32] that's when we've shut down the service
[1:58:34] and people are leaving and going and you
[1:58:37] know and someone was filled with the
[1:58:39] Holy Ghost
[1:58:40] a young lady was filled with the Holy
[1:58:42] Ghost in an after service
[1:58:45] and now she's married and has children
[1:58:47] and
[1:58:50] [Music]
[1:58:51] just feel like we're walking in sacred
[1:58:53] Sands together and I I want you to be
[1:58:55] real sensitive and I want you to come
[1:58:57] ready and prepared and I believe the
[1:58:59] Lord's going to do great things and I
[1:59:01] can see it on some of you tonight
[1:59:03] the Lord is just softened in your heart
[1:59:05] and he's working and he he he's trying
[1:59:08] to take away your sorrow
[1:59:10] he's trying to take away and deal with
[1:59:12] matters much
[1:59:14] deeper than the surface
[1:59:16] and he'll bring someone from a whole
[1:59:18] nother country and put him on an
[1:59:20] airplane and make him fly for hours and
[1:59:22] hours and hours till they feel like
[1:59:23] they're going crazy
[1:59:24] to just be dropped right down and just
[1:59:27] say a word right for you
[1:59:29] you say that person don't know me they
[1:59:31] don't know my life they don't know my
[1:59:33] situation and what they said was exactly
[1:59:37] what I needed to hear and you say give
[1:59:38] God praise and we give God glory and
[1:59:41] that's how it all works
[1:59:43] so can we do that this week
