[5:27] [Music]
[5:51] good morning everyone how are you all
[5:53] doing
[5:55] you're Wide Awake
[5:57] have a good sleep
[6:00] sometimes we get good sleeps and we feel
[6:02] refreshed other days we don't get a very
[6:03] good sleep but we say we are refreshed
[6:06] anyway
[6:06] [Music]
[6:08] have a funny habit of like being
[6:11] tired at about six o'clock you know like
[6:13] last night at six o'clock I was so tired
[6:15] I was kind of falling asleep and then
[6:17] because I was very tired and then I've
[6:20] got an annoying habit of getting a
[6:22] second wind at about 11 o'clock and like
[6:25] three o'clock I'm still trying to go
[6:27] back to sleep I'm like man I thought I
[6:29] was tired at six o'clock but this is
[6:30] like seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[6:33] you're talking like eight hours later
[6:34] and I'm still like awake
[6:36] but that's all right we we are here to
[6:39] praise the Lord this morning whether
[6:41] we're tired whether we're refreshed it
[6:43] doesn't really matter
[6:45] the Lord is always good you know we have
[6:47] these ups and downs on on life's journey
[6:48] but there is a place of rest that we are
[6:51] coming into
[6:52] and that's that's the that's the place
[6:53] that we are looking forward to
[6:55] so um there's a song that says in the
[6:58] toils of the way will seem nothing when
[7:00] I get to the end of the road when I get
[7:02] to the end of the way you know these
[7:03] these efforts that we make here are
[7:06] going to seem some are significant when
[7:08] we get there we're going to think man
[7:09] I'm so glad I made that effort the
[7:11] effort we made is not go even going to
[7:13] compare to what we get from that effort
[7:16] I believe
[7:18] so let's um let's stand this morning and
[7:20] just commit the service to the Lord
[7:21] we're in for a great time this morning I
[7:23] believe the Lord's gonna he's really
[7:24] gonna move in our service this morning
[7:25] we're going to have such a powerful time

[7:29] expectation and I believe that that you
[7:31] are too and yeah we're just I'm just so
[7:34] happy this morning I believe we're in
[7:35] for a great time have you noticed that
[7:37] and for the past while there's been such
[7:39] a powerful presence of God in our midst
[7:41] you know we just keep on drawing on the
[7:42] spirit of God and he keeps on he keeps
[7:44] on coming he he doesn't he's he's not
[7:47] sort of running out of energy
[7:49] to bless us we sometimes run out of
[7:51] energy but the Lord is not running out
[7:53] of energy or Spirit to pour out he's
[7:54] actually got he's got more than we could
[7:56] ever imagine so let's just continue to

[45:44] your seats uh this morning so I want to
[45:47] just go into this really about what kind
[45:49] of what are you listening to and what
[45:51] you're listening to is going to lead you
[45:52] to a place amen so here we are we have
[45:55] this opening scene where uh where the
[45:57] Lord Jesus would speak of um he would he
[46:00] would go back into history and he would
[46:02] speak of the days of lot speak of the
[46:04] days of Noah he'd say when you see those
[46:06] conditions upon the Earth that's the
[46:07] conditions that the Earth is going to be
[46:09] in when I am revealed amen and we know
[46:11] that we're living
[46:13] we don't need to stretch things out to
[46:16] say we're living in this day amen we're
[46:18] living in the days of Noah married wives
[46:19] given a marriage imagine divorce on
[46:22] every hand you know they're all troubled
[46:24] all those things going on there also in
[46:26] the days of lot those are the days of
[46:27] Sodom and Gomorrah we know we're living
[46:29] in those days amen the greatest cult you
[46:31] know there's a great cultural going on
[46:33] about who can use what bathroom all
[46:34] these kind of things but you know we're
[46:36] living in this kind of a day
[46:38] now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna kind
[46:41] of drop I'm probably gonna jump around
[46:42] quite a lot but that's kind of what I do
[46:44] but um so there's a there's a politician
[46:46] in the days of the French Revolution
[46:48] this guy Pierre I can't pronounce his
[46:50] last name he said citizens we have
[46:52] reason to fear that the revolution now
[46:53] he was actually uh in favor of the
[46:55] Revolution like Saturn will success will
[46:58] successively devour all of its children
[47:00] and finally produce despotism which is a
[47:02] tyranny with the calamities that
[47:04] accompany it now this is what he was
[47:06] saying he was for the revolution he got
[47:07] guillotined by the way in the revolution
[47:10] he's saying that the children of
[47:12] Revolution so Saturn was a was a God and
[47:15] and and he said that his children would
[47:17] would um would would basically Dethrone
[47:19] him and and destroy him so as soon as
[47:21] all of his children were born he
[47:23] devoured them this is what their myth
[47:24] says but he says that the children of
[47:26] Revolution will be devoured by the
[47:28] revolution that they came out of and
[47:30] this world has had a revolution it's
[47:31] turned down the message of Jesus Christ
[47:33] it's turned down the baptism of the Holy
[47:35] Ghost it did it in the 50s brother Bram
[47:37] told us this so what happening now is
[47:39] there's been a revolution against Christ
[47:41] himself so what's happening to
[47:42] everything that's been birthed out of
[47:44] this revolution is being devoured that's
[47:46] why this fussing this fighting there's
[47:48] trouble on every hand there's the left
[47:49] and the right and the extremes and the
[47:51] whatever camp that people put themselves
[47:53] in but they're devouring one another
[47:54] that's why this world is tearing itself
[47:56] apart
[47:58] but I'm so thankful that we're not
[47:59] called to be caught up in that amen
[48:01] we've heard a higher calling amen we've
[48:03] we've heard a message from the Throne of
[48:05] God to take us to the throne of God so
[48:08] don't get caught up in all this stuff
[48:09] that's going on in the world you know
[48:11] conspiracy theories for argument's sake
[48:13] it may be 100 true I'm not saying it is
[48:15] but even if it is it's not going to
[48:17] Rapture you amen all the all the covert
[48:19] stuff no covert stuff global warming
[48:21] stuff economic stuff all that stuff it's
[48:23] not going to Rapture one of us it's
[48:25] going to keep people here and it's
[48:27] designed to keep people here amen so
[48:29] you've got to be very careful about the
[48:31] anointing that's upon you and the
[48:33] message you listen to because whatever
[48:35] you're listening to will take you to a
[48:36] place that'll either take you into a
[48:38] Great Tribulation or it'll take you in a
[48:39] Rapture depends where you want to go
[48:41] what ticket have you got in your hand
[48:43] you know it's like if you want to fly to
[48:45] another country you buy that ticket amen
[48:47] because you want to go there is that
[48:48] right Amen to the same thing if you want
[48:50] to go to heaven your ticket's been
[48:51] bought for you by the blood of Jesus
[48:53] Christ but you got to go get the ticket
[48:54] you've got to go get the token because
[48:56] you want to go there if you want to go
[48:57] into a Great Tribulation while I say
[48:59] good luck to you you'll need all the
[49:00] luck you can get we don't need luck in
[49:02] this day because we've got the Holy
[49:03] Ghost but on that day they won't have
[49:04] the Holy Ghost they'll need luck to
[49:06] survive I remember we don't need luck we
[49:08] just need the anointing of the Holy
[49:09] Ghost to come down to a manifest his
[49:10] word in our lives do you know it's been
[49:12] you know you know this is actually
[49:13] Pentecost weekend
[49:15] hello it's been 50 days from Easter
[49:17] which is the day of Pentecost I'm so
[49:19] thankful we don't uh just have an
[49:21] anniversary of an event that happened
[49:22] about 2 000 years ago but we have a
[49:24] Pentecost today and aware of a living
[49:26] God today amen that anointed people amen
[49:29] moves them into a position manifests
[49:31] this word so don't be caught up in the
[49:33] all the stuff going on because what is
[49:35] it it's the children of Revolution being
[49:36] devoured by the revolution
[49:38] that's the religious non-religious
[49:40] atheist whatever more whatever camp
[49:42] they're devouring one another and I've
[49:44] never seen a single person who feeds off
[49:46] conspiracy theories that is bubbling
[49:48] that is happy that is full of full of
[49:51] love and peace and joy that's if you
[49:54] want something to steal your joy feed on
[49:56] that stuff
[49:57] it's like you're basically giving over
[49:59] your Victory if you want to lose all
[50:01] your Victory all of your joy in the Holy
[50:03] Ghost all of your love or your love for
[50:05] your family your love for people on the
[50:07] street your love for this world just
[50:09] feed on that stuff
[50:10] 100 of the time it'll cause people get
[50:12] all critical and crappy and fussy and
[50:15] what's happening you know because it's
[50:16] interesting you can tell what people eat
[50:17] spiritually
[50:18] you can tell what they've been listening
[50:20] to you can be tell what even what
[50:22] preacher they've been listening to
[50:23] because it'll manifest in their life but
[50:25] if they've been feeding off the body
[50:26] word of the son of man this should be be
[50:29] a bubbling coming forth there should be
[50:30] a joy there should be a thankfulness and
[50:32] a rejoicing I trust you not looking at
[50:34] me today not knowing what I'm talking
[50:36] about I mean I trust you know amen I
[50:38] know exactly what you mean Brother Band
[50:39] I mean I've been feeding on the word of
[50:41] God I've been drinking in his goodness
[50:43] I've been drinking from the fountain The
[50:45] Fountains come all over me I've been in
[50:47] the fountain swimming and rejoicing
[50:48] hallelujah praise God I trust that's
[50:51] what you've been doing
[50:53] this ain't no Pie in the Sky folks this
[50:55] is reality
[50:56] amen this world you know we were told 60
[51:00] years ago at least that the world's
[51:01] falling apart
[51:03] I mean what everyone oh well this is One
[51:05] World Government blah blah blah blah
[51:07] that's old news
[51:08] that's all news you've just dug up an
[51:10] old newspaper put it in color and there
[51:12] it is and people say wow this is all
[51:13] happening it was prophesied it was
[51:15] happening
[51:16] John sword and symbol form of the Book
[51:18] of Revelation now we're seeing it come
[51:19] it's a manifestation but I just wanna
[51:22] I'm just going to put this in where are
[51:23] we you know you make an order of slides
[51:25] but hey it's ain't really going to
[51:27] happen now
[51:28] people are so afraid we're gonna
[51:30] basically we'll we're basically driving
[51:32] and it's a slow motion car crash you
[51:35] know the bride and just how everything's
[51:36] happening in the church and basically
[51:38] this is what people kind of get under
[51:39] this anointing of fear wow they see a
[51:42] corner turn or something and they just
[51:43] say we're going in that ditch now where
[51:45] you're looking is where you you know I
[51:47] remember when I first got on a quad bike
[51:49] I was yay big and the quad bike was
[51:50] small and I kept crashing all over the
[51:52] place and my dad told me some very good
[51:54] advice where you're looking is where
[51:55] you'll drive right right so I got back
[51:57] on that quad bike and I realized look
[51:58] I'm going here so I look there now I'm
[52:00] turning this way so I'm looking I didn't
[52:02] crash anymore why because where I was
[52:04] looking is where I drove so if you're
[52:06] looking at the world you're going to
[52:07] crash into the world Amen and the world
[52:09] doesn't see him no more but ye shall see
[52:11] me so if you're not of the world you'll
[52:13] see Christ in your day but if you're
[52:15] under the anointing of the world you
[52:16] won't see him no more
[52:18] Hallelujah I trust you under the
[52:19] anointing of the Holy Ghost so you see
[52:21] him now not just back in the 60s where
[52:23] brother Brown was here and the message
[52:25] no today he's Jesus Christ the same
[52:27] yesterday today and forever amen so if
[52:30] you're caught up in the things of the
[52:31] world you won't see him
[52:33] but if you're anointed by the Holy Ghost
[52:35] you see him
[52:36] Hallelujah so now we're all scared all
[52:39] the World's Gonna you know the devil's
[52:40] gonna shut us all up and everything's
[52:42] gonna be you know all these things but
[52:43] no brother man comes down to the end of
[52:45] his ministry and he says and his church
[52:47] stands alone we stand alone with Christ
[52:48] do we not amen I'm talking about the
[52:50] church or the bride around the world
[52:52] Amen we stand with him she is not hooked
[52:54] up with nothing but she but he uh but he
[52:58] was identified by God being the body
[52:59] that God dwelt in and the church is
[53:01] identified by his body doing the same
[53:03] thing she is his body the manifested
[53:06] truth of his promised word for the last
[53:08] days and she and she stands alone stands
[53:10] by it that's why the devil's howling
[53:12] these great organizations so set up
[53:14] something to close her up they'll never
[53:16] do it amen she'll be taken up not closed
[53:19] up amen say everything's been set up to
[53:21] try and close us up they'll never do it
[53:23] it doesn't matter how much the devil
[53:25] schemes and Rants and Raves do you see
[53:27] it on the internet people rant and Rave
[53:29] about the message being false I'm sorry
[53:31] it caused me to meet the god of the
[53:33] Bible it caused me to see the promises
[53:35] of the Bible manifested about life it
[53:37] gave me the Holy Ghost change my nature
[53:39] Transform Me brought Jesus out of
[53:41] History I'm sorry you can have your
[53:43] arguments all you want this message is
[53:45] true because I've tasted and seen the
[53:46] Lord is good amen it's not an argument
[53:49] of the mind it's a New Birth by the Holy
[53:51] Ghost amen that's why the carnal mind
[53:53] can never understand then the word but
[53:55] the problem is everyone is presented
[53:57] with the Holy Ghost but if you turn it
[53:58] down you go into chaos if you if you
[54:01] receive him you'll have peace
[54:02] forevermore I mean you may have trouble
[54:04] in your life either peace in your soul
[54:05] and you know where you're going
[54:07] that's a good deal I think that's a real
[54:10] good deal
[54:11] are there any are there any strings
[54:12] attached no you just have Victory after
[54:14] Victory sure the devil's on your case
[54:16] but hey God gets on his case if the
[54:18] devil gets on your case amen because
[54:20] remember we serve a very big God so so
[54:22] they won't close us up up amen we'll be
[54:25] taken up she is now risen by the power
[54:27] of the Vindicated word promised to her
[54:29] amen now the bride holds that promise
[54:31] what's that promise he told me he would
[54:33] return to after me I'll believe it
[54:35] uh-huh yes sir to meet her headship her
[54:37] Redeemer her husband or King her Lord
[54:39] her love of her Savior and the provided
[54:41] me meeting place with me here he's
[54:43] already provided all the way to get
[54:44] there amen it's like I've never seen
[54:46] anyone be upset when they get a ticket
[54:48] to go around the world traveling all
[54:50] right
[54:50] what I gotta get on this planet no
[54:52] they're excited what am I going to see
[54:54] where am I going Hallelujah you know
[54:55] it's the same thing with the believer we
[54:57] should just be happy
[54:58] in spite of what's going on in life
[55:00] remember we this will never Walking with
[55:03] God does not take trouble away it
[55:04] actually brings trouble on the scene but
[55:06] it caused that trouble to be defeated
[55:07] amen so it turns into a victory and a
[55:09] rejoicing Hallelujah so we shouldn't be
[55:12] all caught up well you say well what
[55:13] about the mark of the beast you'll
[55:14] become a time when we can't buy or sell
[55:16] you know that's after the Rapture that's
[55:19] after the Rapture that comes into place
[55:20] so why are we so consumed by something
[55:22] that's going to happen when we're not
[55:24] here unless we're anointed to be there
[55:27] see that's what we're going to be very
[55:28] careful what we're feeding on because
[55:30] these are people that are being prepared
[55:32] for the Great Tribulation there are
[55:33] Christian people that will stand and
[55:36] give their lives in the Great
[55:37] Tribulation right the Bible tells us
[55:39] that but there is a bride that goes in
[55:41] the Rapture before the tribulation but
[55:43] the message you're feeding on will
[55:45] dictate where you go
[55:47] amen it's it's it's really that simple
[55:50] amen if you're feeding on the word of
[55:52] the hour you'll be taken it amen in the
[55:55] last sign of the hour which is the body
[55:56] change
[55:58] amen praise God now when he gets all the
[56:01] money under control sure then he'll
[56:03] break the Covenant with the juices
[56:05] Daniel said here I'm just going to read
[56:06] this because I want this to really sink
[56:07] in in the midst of the last half of the
[56:10] 70 weeks of Daniel then brother what
[56:12] will he do he'll have all the world
[56:13] trade and commerce impact with the world
[56:15] because he'll hold the wealth of the
[56:17] world completely during that time during
[56:19] that time
[56:20] them two prophets will rise on the scene
[56:22] and call that 144 000 then will take
[56:25] place in the mark of the beast of
[56:26] Revelations 13. we'll sit in because
[56:28] he'll he he holds all the Commerce trade
[56:30] everything in um of the world and what
[56:32] will take place in the mark of the beast
[56:33] will come in that no one can buy or sell
[56:35] except he there's the mark of the beast
[56:37] thank God the church will be enjoying a
[56:40] great three and a half years in glory
[56:41] won't have to go through that Hallelujah
[56:44] so why worry about something that you're
[56:47] not here to face
[56:49] I mean it's really that simple you think
[56:51] about it just say if there's other news
[56:52] is a great category five storm coming
[56:55] into Wellington
[56:57] but you're not here
[56:59] why get all troubled about what's going
[57:02] to happen to you if you're not here but
[57:04] you're not here so it can't happen to
[57:05] you I mean it's really I don't have more
[57:06] plainer I can make it but if you you
[57:08] know it's just like oh there was a big
[57:09] car crash out here on the road why
[57:11] stress about it if you're not there
[57:12] you're not on the road at the time
[57:14] you're actually here you're not there
[57:15] and it's like this oh the Beast is going
[57:17] to take over and there's going to be all
[57:18] sure he's going to do it but he does it
[57:21] when we go up remember remember the Holy
[57:24] Ghost is here holding them back that he
[57:26] can gather his redeemed to himself
[57:28] Hallelujah so why you know we can just
[57:31] praise God and be happy we laugh all the
[57:33] way to the bank as the saying goes why
[57:34] because God has called us not to go in a
[57:37] Great Tribulation but to go in the
[57:39] Rapture this message is a Rapture call
[57:41] it is the rapture call right it is not a
[57:44] tribulation anointing
[57:46] Hallelujah you see now
[57:49] you see if we go back to Genesis 18 as
[57:51] it was in the days of lot we know that
[57:53] Abraham was waiting on the plains of
[57:54] memory for the promise he was under
[57:56] expectation for the promised son to
[57:58] appear Hallelujah they were looking for
[58:01] Isaac he'd been waiting for 25 years but
[58:03] here he was I mean but Sarah's heart
[58:05] needed to be turned from unbelief to
[58:07] Faith because remember Abraham believed
[58:08] God but it took a while for Sarah to
[58:10] catch up and sometimes it takes a while
[58:11] for us to catch up but as long as we
[58:13] catch up amen if we're part of the
[58:14] promise we'll catch up Hallelujah but
[58:16] you say Lord make the word real to me
[58:18] amen don't make it just something in my
[58:20] mind or someone else's you see someone
[58:22] else dance and rejoice you should say
[58:24] Lord I want that kind of victory in my
[58:25] life Hallelujah so so you know he would
[58:28] you know Abraham was there that he saw
[58:30] three men come towards him and he
[58:33] addressed one of them as my Lord and if
[58:34] you continue reading down Genesis there
[58:36] you know it says that two of them went
[58:38] down to Sodom but the Lord stayed with
[58:40] Abraham and told him what he was going
[58:41] to do well because it was God in flesh
[58:43] and there was two angels and flesh as
[58:44] well God can create bodies for angels to
[58:46] step into if he wants to amen so you
[58:48] know didn't they ate food and they you
[58:50] know and then now it came to a point
[58:52] where where where where God would say
[58:54] where is Sarah thy wife I'm just
[58:56] paraphrasing this you can read it I'm
[58:57] sure everyone's familiar with the story
[58:59] you know where is Sarah thy wife and you
[59:01] know in the tent behind you and you know
[59:03] and God see is certainly according to
[59:04] time of life I'm going to visit you
[59:06] you're going to have the promised son
[59:07] time of life speaks of a woman not a man
[59:09] and Sarah laughed within herself she's
[59:12] in the tent behind God God came down in
[59:14] flesh she she laughed within herself
[59:16] saying how can I have a child how can I
[59:18] have pleasure with my Lord because my
[59:20] Lord is old also then the Lord said to
[59:22] Abraham why did Sarah laugh so God came
[59:24] down in flesh and discerned what Sarah
[59:25] was doing in the tent behind him and
[59:28] this was exactly the same sign that
[59:30] Jesus did to the woman at the well knew
[59:32] exactly how many husbands she had you
[59:34] know many places in the gospel said that
[59:36] she uh um he he rather the Lord knew
[59:38] their thoughts and would you know say
[59:39] behold in Israel without no goal
[59:41] speaking to Philip and you know
[59:42] Nathaniel and different ones and you see
[59:44] see this was this was God come down and
[59:46] made flesh this is what happened now
[59:48] they were looking for a visitation that
[59:51] God would turn them young again that
[59:53] they could have that promised son that
[59:54] their hearts would be turned to Faith
[59:56] because Sarah doubted the promise until
[59:58] this visitation and I'd say it'd be
[1:00:00] pretty much the same thing with you and
[1:00:02] I or the church for 2000 years has been
[1:00:04] looking for the return of the promised
[1:00:05] son but our hearts had to be turned by a
[1:00:08] prophetic message that we could receive
[1:00:09] him in the air I mean because remember
[1:00:11] that God could you know it was easy for
[1:00:14] God to turn their lives young again
[1:00:15] that's one thing but but he had to
[1:00:18] change their bodies for them to have the
[1:00:19] promised son to receive the promise and
[1:00:21] it's the same thing with you and I God
[1:00:23] can make us all 18 again or if you're
[1:00:25] not 18 make you 18. right he can do that
[1:00:27] but he he's got to change these bodies
[1:00:29] that we can meet him in the air we can
[1:00:31] change Dimensions amen so when the Lord
[1:00:33] came down and spoke to Abraham there and
[1:00:35] Sarah it was their visitation that she
[1:00:38] would receive faith that they could
[1:00:39] receive the promised son now during this
[1:00:42] time I mean two of those angels we know
[1:00:45] went down to get lot out of Sodom
[1:00:47] because Abraham was there waiting for
[1:00:49] the promise to be fulfilled but lot was
[1:00:51] caught up in the politics of Sodom it
[1:00:53] says in the Bible that righteous lot was
[1:00:55] fixed by the conversation of the
[1:00:57] sodomites and different things so he was
[1:00:59] he was troubled by what was going on
[1:01:00] inside him he was even the mayor of the
[1:01:02] city he sat in the gate which is a place
[1:01:04] of judgment amen but his witness became
[1:01:07] totally ineffective to what was going on
[1:01:09] in Sodom and Gomorrah it became so
[1:01:11] ineffective that even his sons-in-laws
[1:01:12] laughed at him when he said these angels
[1:01:14] would come to take us out this place is
[1:01:15] going to burn amen so so so he he was
[1:01:18] righteous compared to the sodomites but
[1:01:19] his he couldn't change the cycle they
[1:01:22] were going into and sadly this is the
[1:01:25] same thing today we cannot return this
[1:01:27] nation to Christ America will never
[1:01:30] return to Christ on a big scale they've
[1:01:31] turned him down we can never
[1:01:33] christianize the world again amen that
[1:01:36] age is over amen I'm sorry to say it but
[1:01:38] that age is over there's still elect
[1:01:39] ones here and there they've got to come
[1:01:40] in sure we're going to keep seeking them
[1:01:42] until the last one comes and then we can
[1:01:44] go home amen so we should have a burden
[1:01:46] for lost souls absolutely whosoever will
[1:01:49] let them come if you've got a willing
[1:01:51] Heart Lord I'm gonna come I'm not
[1:01:53] worried he doesn't care what condition
[1:01:55] you're in what you've been through what
[1:01:56] you're thinking amen just come to him
[1:01:58] and let him change your life
[1:02:01] amen but then brother Brown would pick
[1:02:02] this up and say now we're living in this
[1:02:04] day
[1:02:05] and and he would speak about you know
[1:02:07] the two angels who went down to the side
[1:02:09] of me it was quite a few times he just
[1:02:10] says they're Billy Graham and old
[1:02:12] Roberts went down but he speaks about
[1:02:14] Jack Schuller and all these great men
[1:02:15] out there these great revivalists they
[1:02:17] have to because they're because they're
[1:02:19] jerking out they're jerking out people
[1:02:20] out of Sodom so there's a great time
[1:02:22] when the prophet was here great
[1:02:23] revivalists would sweep the land but it
[1:02:25] was a message to get the nominal church
[1:02:27] out of Destruction and so he says it's
[1:02:30] not just it's not just all Roberts and
[1:02:32] Billy Graham but there are other men
[1:02:33] anointed because remember it's an
[1:02:34] anointing it's not a man it's an
[1:02:37] anointing that goes out to catch a
[1:02:39] people Amen to these ones were Anointed
[1:02:41] with the spirit here to bring the
[1:02:43] nominal church out of Destruction right
[1:02:46] and this is and so it's the same thing
[1:02:49] today
[1:02:50] there's still people on the Earth that
[1:02:52] are preaching to get people out of
[1:02:54] Destruction
[1:02:56] amen but we know Abraham's message was
[1:02:58] different to lot's message Abraham was
[1:03:01] waiting for the promised son the
[1:03:02] promised son wasn't promised a lot
[1:03:04] though lot was saved amen no but the but
[1:03:07] the promised son was promised to Abraham
[1:03:09] and it's the same thing under the true
[1:03:11] message of the hour amen the promised
[1:03:13] son the Lord Jesus Christ is promised to
[1:03:15] the bride of Christ amen he is promised
[1:03:18] to her amen and this word has come to
[1:03:20] prepare us that we can receive him in
[1:03:22] the air that's why he would say in John
[1:03:24] 14 let not your hearts be troubled you
[1:03:27] believe in God believe also in Me and My
[1:03:28] Father's House of many mansions I go to
[1:03:31] prepare a place for you and if I go and
[1:03:33] prepare a place for you I'll come again
[1:03:34] and receive you unto myself that where I
[1:03:36] am not where you are not on this Earth
[1:03:38] but where I am in that Dimension you
[1:03:40] shall be also so that's what this
[1:03:42] message is as Christ Has Come Again
[1:03:43] revealed himself again what to receive a
[1:03:46] bride to himself to carry her away I
[1:03:49] mean that's the message of the hour in a
[1:03:50] nutshell Hallelujah Andy glad he's come
[1:03:53] to carry you away I mean he has come to
[1:03:55] receive you unto yourself unto himself
[1:03:57] you say well I'm in sin I'm Richard I'm
[1:03:59] done horrible things God don't care
[1:04:01] about that his blood takes care of
[1:04:02] everything his blood takes care of every
[1:04:04] trouble mind battle complex pain hurt
[1:04:07] his blood takes care of it all
[1:04:08] Hallelujah I believe that don't you
[1:04:11] there's nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:21] amen but when he come down to Sodom look
[1:04:24] what he did at Sodom and Sodom he
[1:04:25] referred to uh to that for this age now
[1:04:27] remember the sodomites were Gentiles
[1:04:29] notice and there come three men one day
[1:04:31] to Abraham there's always three classes
[1:04:33] of people
[1:04:34] as unbelievers make Believers and
[1:04:36] Believers we still have them today
[1:04:37] that's right unbelievers make Believers
[1:04:39] Believers sodomites lotites and
[1:04:40] abrahamites Abraham had the promise
[1:04:43] Hallelujah we have a promise we have a
[1:04:46] promise of a rapture we have a promise
[1:04:49] of dancing on streets of God we have a
[1:04:50] promise of a place that the marriage
[1:04:51] supper of the Lamb amen we have a
[1:04:53] promise he'll never leave us nor forsake
[1:04:55] us amen it got a bit difficult there
[1:04:57] with Abraham and Sarah on the planes of
[1:04:59] memory they didn't have the well-watered
[1:05:00] parts and they are but but hey they they
[1:05:03] were living under a promise and that's
[1:05:05] the main thing amen that God remember it
[1:05:07] wasn't Abraham making a promise with God
[1:05:09] it was God making a promise with Abraham
[1:05:11] and that's the big difference it's not
[1:05:13] necessarily us saying Lord I'll serve
[1:05:14] you and do all I can for youth no it's
[1:05:16] the Covenant he made with you first I
[1:05:18] mean we just do that out of reaction to
[1:05:19] what he's already done for us should I
[1:05:21] just go down to second gear Maybe
[1:05:23] this has got the hill a little bit
[1:05:25] because we're ascending I mean this
[1:05:26] morning praise a little bit you've got
[1:05:28] to realize that God made a covenant with
[1:05:30] you and I and and that's because
[1:05:32] remember we could never remember you
[1:05:34] know God with Moses and your children of
[1:05:36] Israel said if you will I will yeah it
[1:05:39] was conditional man always fails right
[1:05:42] that's why there's Wars and strife and
[1:05:44] trouble there's no agreements between
[1:05:45] nations you know there's no peace why
[1:05:47] because there's Fallen man involved but
[1:05:50] but that's why God said I'm going to
[1:05:51] make this Covenant unconditional with
[1:05:53] you Abraham I have made you the father
[1:05:55] of many nations amen and then he had no
[1:05:58] children he had no ability to do it but
[1:06:00] he said God said I have made you thus
[1:06:02] and it's very important that we confess
[1:06:05] what God has made us even if it may be
[1:06:07] contrary to the present state that we
[1:06:09] think we're in amen because there was
[1:06:11] Abraham impossible to have a child amen
[1:06:13] couldn't have it Sarah couldn't have a
[1:06:14] child but God said I've made you a
[1:06:16] father of Nations that's why I'm
[1:06:18] changing your name but he'd say no but
[1:06:20] see thing he didn't confess the
[1:06:22] condition of himself he didn't repeat
[1:06:24] back to God his confession you know that
[1:06:26] this is how I am and this is impossible
[1:06:28] no it says the Bible said and he
[1:06:30] believed God
[1:06:31] that's why it's very important that
[1:06:33] faith is preached I mean that your faith
[1:06:35] is ministered to to one another amen
[1:06:38] that where The Virtuous spotless bride
[1:06:40] of Jesus Christ that Christ died on
[1:06:42] Calvary for you and I that everything
[1:06:44] that the devil could try and hold you to
[1:06:46] this Earth with has been annihilated by
[1:06:47] the blood of Jesus Christ amen that
[1:06:49] you're more than an overcomer I mean
[1:06:51] you're built to overcome this age
[1:06:52] hallelujah we're built amen we're
[1:06:54] purpose-built to overcome this age amen
[1:06:57] God has built us amen that we will not
[1:06:59] fail we will win this war why because
[1:07:02] Christ has already one of that down
[1:07:03] Calvary amen that we're walking in
[1:07:05] Victory and it doesn't matter what
[1:07:07] you're facing you know we're actually
[1:07:08] talking about seeing God in nature
[1:07:10] driving to church this morning and you
[1:07:12] know and you know I just look at The Rim
[1:07:14] attackers you know you know I started
[1:07:16] rejoicing in my heart I think praise God
[1:07:18] there's a mountain of God holy there's a
[1:07:21] Mount Zion Hallelujah but also I thought
[1:07:23] about says in um Zechariah says you know
[1:07:26] what are you great Mountain before this
[1:07:28] is a zeruberable you'll become a plane I
[1:07:30] mean it doesn't matter how big the enemy
[1:07:32] may be in front of you it's going to
[1:07:33] become a plane I mean there's not some
[1:07:35] big obstacle you cannot across would go
[1:07:37] over but God will make it a plane that
[1:07:39] you can just walk across it as level
[1:07:41] ground Hallelujah it doesn't matter it
[1:07:43] wouldn't matter it was the whole
[1:07:44] Himalayas in front of you it can look
[1:07:46] that big you can't even see the see the
[1:07:48] summit but God will make it a plane
[1:07:50] Hallelujah because God said we will
[1:07:52] stand God said we'll be victorious God
[1:07:55] said the enemy will be under our feet
[1:07:56] that's what God Said I mean God said
[1:07:59] you're made in my image amen washed in
[1:08:01] my blood that's what God has said it's
[1:08:03] very important because that's what to
[1:08:04] confess that because that's God's
[1:08:06] confession of you
[1:08:09] you mean we're just a parrot in a way
[1:08:11] yes we are but it actually anchors in
[1:08:12] our heart we're repeating what God said
[1:08:14] about you and I don't take that in a bad
[1:08:17] way saying parapara just repeat things I
[1:08:20] don't know if they believe what they say
[1:08:21] but we believe what we say about
[1:08:22] ourselves
[1:08:23] Hallelujah
[1:08:25] amen Abraham had the promise he was the
[1:08:28] elected called out group that had
[1:08:29] separated himself you know people get
[1:08:31] offended with that kind of statement how
[1:08:33] do you say you're the called out ones
[1:08:34] well I've been called out
[1:08:36] I don't know what you're doing but this
[1:08:38] is what I'm doing I Heard a Voice one
[1:08:40] day I was drunk at Uni and making home
[1:08:42] brew and doing all kind of evil stuff
[1:08:43] but then I Heard a Voice I put on some
[1:08:45] headphones saying good morning friends
[1:08:47] and God changed my life and he called me
[1:08:49] out lord said come out of here well okay
[1:08:52] I'm coming
[1:08:53] well you know well I've been called out
[1:08:55] so but people get offended by that kind
[1:08:58] of statement but we are we are the Bible
[1:09:00] says we're elected predestination is not
[1:09:02] a yucky word it's quite a nice word
[1:09:04] actually because I've realized if God
[1:09:06] predestined me before the foundation of
[1:09:08] the world then the devil can't do
[1:09:10] anything in time to stop that
[1:09:11] predestination hi Lewis I'm just happy
[1:09:14] about that you know I trust you're happy
[1:09:15] too amen some people get offended but I
[1:09:18] just say praise God thank you Lord I'm
[1:09:20] happy about this this is a great deal I
[1:09:22] don't know why he did it for me but he
[1:09:23] did it for me so I accept it you know I
[1:09:25] don't I don't try and throw my own
[1:09:27] Humanity you know in the way and say
[1:09:29] Lord you can't do this no
[1:09:31] if he can speak the 100 billion stars
[1:09:34] into existence and let there be and all
[1:09:37] these things created and you know part
[1:09:38] the Red Sea and quench the fire and
[1:09:41] doing credit raise the dead and he can
[1:09:43] save me then you know really honestly
[1:09:46] let's just let's just put this in
[1:09:47] Balance you know you know this world has
[1:09:49] got totally no perspective
[1:09:51] you know you go down uh I was going to
[1:09:53] say a monkey hole but a rabbit hole of
[1:09:55] conspiracy stuff you know it's the enemy
[1:09:57] you're saying look at this
[1:10:00] yeah look at this monkey hole I'm going
[1:10:01] to call it a monkey hole because it's a
[1:10:03] monkey hole all that it may be all true
[1:10:05] but it's still a monkey hole because it
[1:10:06] doesn't make faith it doesn't increase
[1:10:08] your faith one bit you know you could
[1:10:10] actually someone could stand here and
[1:10:13] actually expose all the evils of the
[1:10:15] world that one raps you
[1:10:17] if you know Christ he'll wraps you the
[1:10:20] only one that can wraps you is the
[1:10:22] message of the hour which is Jesus
[1:10:23] Christ
[1:10:24] amen amen
[1:10:27] praise God where are yes I'm just I'm
[1:10:29] just enjoying myself right now you know
[1:10:31] amen we've been separated amen
[1:10:33] hallelujah from the things of the world
[1:10:35] cause he was relying upon the promise of
[1:10:38] God he was relying on the promise of God
[1:10:40] are you relying on the promise of God
[1:10:42] have you judged him faithful have you
[1:10:45] judged and faithful he's more than able
[1:10:46] to do that which he has promised to you
[1:10:47] I trust I trust you're in that condition
[1:10:49] Lord if you brought me out you're not
[1:10:51] going to leave me here amen you're going
[1:10:53] to leave me in this state maybe you may
[1:10:55] even hate your own personality but God
[1:10:57] made you that way
[1:10:58] Hallelujah I think we stop wrestling
[1:11:00] with ourselves and say Lord you built me
[1:11:03] this way you didn't make a mistake you
[1:11:05] may think you just made out of spare
[1:11:07] parts but God needed someone real out of
[1:11:09] the box you know Hallelujah
[1:11:11] praise God yeah I'm so glad God's not a
[1:11:13] cookie cutter just makes us all the same
[1:11:15] you have the same kind of personality
[1:11:17] and you got to sing the same and praise
[1:11:19] God
[1:11:21] I'm so glad I'm here to provide balance
[1:11:23] you know that's what my dad says about
[1:11:24] things but I'm here to provide balance
[1:11:25] everyone else can sing I can't sing
[1:11:27] we've got balance all right maybe we
[1:11:29] don't need balance anyway
[1:11:31] praise the Lord notice now see I'm just
[1:11:33] going to read BC see the three that went
[1:11:35] to meet Abraham look like men dust on
[1:11:37] their clothes professed they were
[1:11:38] strangers two of them went down to
[1:11:39] preached Asylum trying to find 10 people
[1:11:41] remember went down to Asylum the
[1:11:43] lukewarm Church of modern Billy Graham
[1:11:44] or so forth down inside and preaching
[1:11:46] the gospel blinding the People by the
[1:11:48] gospel that's what the Evangelist Billy
[1:11:49] Graham and Oral Roberts and many of
[1:11:51] these Great Men of God has did shook the
[1:11:53] people see it's an anointing it's not
[1:11:55] just those two there's an anointing and
[1:11:57] that anointing is still here to get a
[1:11:58] people ready to go into a Great
[1:12:00] Tribulation that's why people who are
[1:12:02] Preppers they're anointed man yeah
[1:12:03] they're inspired man we've got to get
[1:12:05] ready man we're going to survive this
[1:12:06] thing the Beast is going to come and
[1:12:08] money's gonna collapse and all these
[1:12:09] that it's all true that's right but
[1:12:11] they're anointed to go into that because
[1:12:14] that's their allotment yes but the bride
[1:12:16] of Christ that's not your destination
[1:12:18] amen you know how you can take you know
[1:12:20] you know Google Maps gives you different
[1:12:21] options right you know sometimes you
[1:12:24] know you can go this way around Lac
[1:12:25] taupo sometimes this way sometimes this
[1:12:28] way around through Hawke's Bay can be
[1:12:29] all crazy kind of ways but you'll end up
[1:12:31] at the same destination yeah and it's
[1:12:33] like the bride and the foolish version
[1:12:34] all these different ones that because
[1:12:36] remember Heaven is not a communistic
[1:12:37] state that everyone's the same it's not
[1:12:39] just the bride and there's no one else
[1:12:41] that's not how God works right but we're
[1:12:44] all going to end up in the same
[1:12:45] destination
[1:12:46] amen I'd rather just take a rapture
[1:12:49] that's me you know maybe you know I just
[1:12:52] yeah I'll take the easy way
[1:12:54] Hallelujah why is it easy why because
[1:12:57] God changes his body I go to enjoy a
[1:12:58] wedding supper but it actually has fun
[1:13:00] but you got to really actually ignore
[1:13:02] that kind of thinking because in reality
[1:13:04] it's I get to walk with my Lord and the
[1:13:07] fullness of his word and the fullness of
[1:13:09] his power and the fullness of his
[1:13:11] anointing all that he is I can know
[1:13:13] right now in this flesh I can walk with
[1:13:16] them and talk with them have a relation
[1:13:17] with them like no one else can because
[1:13:19] the foolish virgin they don't know him
[1:13:21] like we do that's right Hallelujah they
[1:13:24] don't walk with him like we do why
[1:13:26] because we're husband and wife we are
[1:13:27] married we're United amen he talks to me
[1:13:30] like he doesn't talk to them
[1:13:32] that's right Hallelujah you say well
[1:13:34] you're just putting them in that box no
[1:13:36] I'm just happy that he's become one with
[1:13:37] me this is just my experience okay just
[1:13:40] be happy for me
[1:13:42] I trust you're the same kind of boat you
[1:13:44] know man man the Lord met me he's
[1:13:45] changed my life his word is alive he's
[1:13:47] just changed me when I think there's no
[1:13:49] way I could ever be changed my desires I
[1:13:51] don't know how this could happen he just
[1:13:53] comes along and does it you're gonna say
[1:13:55] Lord just take my life and he just
[1:13:56] because I rearranged things in your
[1:13:57] heart and man it's incredible isn't it
[1:13:59] amazing that's why it's supernatural you
[1:14:02] know hell it's not a natural just a mind
[1:14:04] trying to change your mind and thinking
[1:14:06] but God changes our hearts
[1:14:08] Hallelujah now
[1:14:10] where was I going with this
[1:14:12] praise God see so notice the sign that
[1:14:15] he performed he discerned the thoughts
[1:14:17] of Sarah in the tent amen tell what she
[1:14:20] was doing turned us back to her Jesus
[1:14:22] said this would repeat in the days of
[1:14:23] the coming of the son of man we see
[1:14:25] Billy Graham we see the ready we see the
[1:14:27] fire ready to fall the church looking
[1:14:29] for a promised son here we are
[1:14:30] everything just exactly in line waiting
[1:14:32] for that hour the promised son remember
[1:14:34] the last time that Abraham saw and we
[1:14:36] who are born of the spirit of Christ
[1:14:38] Abraham's Royal seed Jesus pardon me
[1:14:41] promised that the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:14:43] would see the same sign that their
[1:14:45] father Abraham seen before the promised
[1:14:47] son came there wasn't one more sign
[1:14:49] Abraham right away Sarah became mother
[1:14:51] and Isaac arrived the last sign was God
[1:14:53] manifested in a man's flesh so that's
[1:14:56] why brother Brown would come to the
[1:14:57] discernment lines he says now I'll turn
[1:14:59] my back like God's back was to Sarah in
[1:15:01] the tent and he began to tell people
[1:15:03] their address and their name and why
[1:15:06] they're there it was details details
[1:15:07] details saying that same sign is now
[1:15:09] repeated in this end time
[1:15:11] right to prove now what he was preaching
[1:15:13] wasn't just nice idea or something
[1:15:15] controversial or something more
[1:15:16] right-wing or fundamental than the rest
[1:15:18] no it was God coming down proving saying
[1:15:21] this is my messenger this is my word
[1:15:24] amen I am here to call you to myself not
[1:15:27] to a man but to Christ himself
[1:15:30] hallelujah amen so that's been repeated
[1:15:32] in this day and you know if someone's
[1:15:34] fully surrendered to God the word still
[1:15:36] discerns through them yes
[1:15:38] yes I mean they don't need to point
[1:15:39] someone out like a prophet say I see the
[1:15:41] pillow fire over you and this and this
[1:15:42] and this but while they're preaching or
[1:15:44] even while they're having Fellowship God
[1:15:45] can discern what's going on in someone's
[1:15:47] life and they don't even know what's
[1:15:49] going on but the person hearing it knows
[1:15:50] exactly what's been going on how many
[1:15:52] times have people been driving up the
[1:15:53] street having a conversation that comes
[1:15:55] over here or in the Sunday school or
[1:15:57] something it's just been Supernatural
[1:15:59] that way why because that say because
[1:16:01] it's an anointing right it's not just a
[1:16:03] prophet it's an anointing of Christ
[1:16:04] himself coming into the church
[1:16:07] Hallelujah that's why it's so incredible
[1:16:09] you know when we can think about you
[1:16:11] know it's been 50 days from Pentecost
[1:16:13] you know but you know we have a real
[1:16:15] Pentecost
[1:16:16] amen amen we have a real Pentecost we we
[1:16:19] have not we are we don't just have a
[1:16:22] painted fire now I've got a picture of
[1:16:23] Pentecost here we're going to show that
[1:16:25] soon but you know
[1:16:26] so we we have heard a word I just I just
[1:16:29] really want to hammer this in a little
[1:16:31] bit amen
[1:16:31] the world has been prepared for a
[1:16:33] tribulation the believer the
[1:16:35] make-believer unbeliever whatever and
[1:16:38] now I'm not talking about the bride
[1:16:39] being believed but those people are
[1:16:40] prepared for a Great Tribulation the
[1:16:42] bride of Christ is being prepared for a
[1:16:44] Rapture what are you listen what are you
[1:16:46] opening your ears to
[1:16:48] right because it'll take you one way or
[1:16:50] another
[1:16:51] because this world is falling apart
[1:16:54] you know I don't need to tell you that
[1:16:55] you can see economics is falling apart
[1:16:57] families are falling apart mental health
[1:16:59] has fallen apart peace between nations
[1:17:01] trades falling apart all these things
[1:17:03] are going on
[1:17:04] it's nothing new
[1:17:07] it was prophesied a very long time ago
[1:17:09] and now we just see it coming to
[1:17:11] manifestation so now why should we be
[1:17:14] caught up with the people who are
[1:17:15] fussing and fighting about remember we
[1:17:17] have a higher calling our calling is to
[1:17:19] find God's people whosoever will you
[1:17:22] know this may sound a bit crazy but I
[1:17:24] would be happy to have a church
[1:17:26] just even a foolish virgin because they
[1:17:28] get salvation
[1:17:30] right as long as someone gets saved I'm
[1:17:32] happy God whatever position they're
[1:17:35] called to that's between God and them
[1:17:37] right but I'd be happy whosoever will
[1:17:39] come and meet the Lord if we can if we
[1:17:41] can help someone just a little step
[1:17:43] closer to God I say praise the Lord that
[1:17:45] was well worth doing
[1:17:48] ministered to but Lord may you Minister
[1:17:51] through me to that person amen they may
[1:17:53] just have a made these give their hearts
[1:17:55] the law that's as far as they go praise
[1:17:57] God as long as they've gone that far and
[1:17:58] God can start working in their lives may
[1:18:00] they get baptized well praise God God
[1:18:02] can continue working their lives you
[1:18:04] know so we should never just say well
[1:18:05] it's either the bride or nothing we need
[1:18:07] to get that no I don't think we have
[1:18:08] that thinking in our mind I pray we
[1:18:10] don't but it's not just the Bride of no
[1:18:11] one right
[1:18:13] God has people everywhere they're called
[1:18:15] to different callings let's be a light
[1:18:17] to everyone and help everyone
[1:18:21] but if we get caught up in what the
[1:18:23] world has been caught up in well we'll
[1:18:25] be devoured as well
[1:18:26] and we don't want to be chewed up by the
[1:18:28] world
[1:18:31] see every everything is falling apart
[1:18:33] every nation's looking for someone or
[1:18:35] some system that could bring them out of
[1:18:37] it see that's to hold them together they
[1:18:40] were so corrupted they they know not
[1:18:42] they um that they couldn't hold out the
[1:18:43] way they were going they was looking for
[1:18:45] something to hold them together if that
[1:18:46] isn't the picture of our world today and
[1:18:48] this is in 1963 but I'll say today
[1:18:51] amen if it isn't a picture of our world
[1:18:53] today I don't know the world it's the
[1:18:54] picture of our world today everything is
[1:18:56] looking for a system or something to
[1:18:58] hold us together it's the picture of it
[1:19:00] today it was looking for some system or
[1:19:02] something that would keep it from
[1:19:03] falling apart as it was then so it is
[1:19:06] now again it's repeated again
[1:19:08] every movement under Heaven is looking
[1:19:10] for a Superman to rise
[1:19:12] like we want to bring well not we
[1:19:15] America Republicans want Trump back or
[1:19:18] they want yeah the the Democrats what
[1:19:20] some Superman or some Superwoman to rise
[1:19:22] they want someone to step on the scene
[1:19:24] that can fix all the problems
[1:19:26] they'll get there Superman we already
[1:19:27] have our Messiah right the bride has
[1:19:30] there
[1:19:31] Superman
[1:19:33] Hallelujah and he's not an alter ego
[1:19:36] that has a troubled past and does all
[1:19:37] these things by night no he's a
[1:19:39] resurrected Jesus Christ Hallelujah so
[1:19:42] if so if he is the king of your life if
[1:19:45] he is your anointed Messiah
[1:19:47] amen your life won't fall apart with the
[1:19:49] world
[1:19:50] amen but you see what happens is people
[1:19:52] try and actually Christians especially
[1:19:54] today they don't realize they're
[1:19:56] actually working against the plan of God
[1:19:59] Simon Peter was a very zealous man
[1:20:01] there's a picture of so this is Simon
[1:20:03] cutting cutting the guy's ear off uh
[1:20:06] malcus's ear off in the Garden of
[1:20:08] Gethsemane you know he will see but the
[1:20:10] thing is Peter didn't realize that what
[1:20:13] he was doing right there was actually
[1:20:15] trying to stop the word of God be
[1:20:17] fulfilled see there he was he was
[1:20:19] zealous he thought he was defending the
[1:20:21] word defending the Faith by taking a
[1:20:23] sword and trying to cut his ear off
[1:20:25] remember he wasn't trying to just cut
[1:20:26] his ear off he was trying to cut his
[1:20:28] head off but he's a fisherman so he
[1:20:30] wasn't too good with the sword right he
[1:20:32] wasn't trained the right way to use the
[1:20:33] sword to cut his head off so he cut his
[1:20:35] ear off and this is what many zealous
[1:20:38] Christians do is they as they try and
[1:20:41] defend Christ but they just cut off
[1:20:42] people's ears that they can't hear
[1:20:43] anymore
[1:20:44] they can't hear anymore see but see the
[1:20:47] thing is Peter didn't realize but he was
[1:20:49] actually doing an antichrist thing right
[1:20:51] here because he was trying to stop Jesus
[1:20:53] go to Calvary
[1:20:55] though it looked good he could have had
[1:20:56] a selfie there look I'm defending the
[1:20:58] faith I'm at this rally I'm doing this
[1:21:00] I'm blogging this kind of stuff but you
[1:21:02] see all he was doing was trying to stop
[1:21:03] the word being fulfilled
[1:21:05] and that's why Jesus said there in in
[1:21:08] verse 11. put up thy sword into thy
[1:21:12] sheath the cup which my father has given
[1:21:13] me shall I not drink it right so he's
[1:21:16] basically saying why put away your sword
[1:21:19] stop trying to hinder the word of God
[1:21:22] and this one but the thing is Peter
[1:21:23] didn't have the Holy Ghost here
[1:21:25] this was Peter before Calvary and and so
[1:21:28] Peter now
[1:21:30] is like many nominal Christians today
[1:21:32] caught up in the politics of the world
[1:21:34] trying to stand for the truth but
[1:21:37] they're just caught up in actually a
[1:21:38] movement that is actually fundamentally
[1:21:40] Antichrist
[1:21:42] because he was say anything against the
[1:21:44] word is Antichrist see so he was being
[1:21:45] Antichrist there he needed to go to
[1:21:47] Pentecost
[1:21:49] amen so let's not and remember there's
[1:21:51] only very few people in the world
[1:21:53] compared to the world's population and
[1:21:54] Christendom that actually have the Holy
[1:21:56] Ghost
[1:21:56] so people always side for organization
[1:21:58] and understanding that way instead of
[1:22:00] being led by the spirit of God see if
[1:22:02] Peter had the Holy Ghost here he
[1:22:04] wouldn't have done this
[1:22:07] amen amen so but you see see the thing
[1:22:09] is we've got to be very careful many
[1:22:10] Christian people so called who are
[1:22:12] preaching against the One World
[1:22:14] Government all these things they are not
[1:22:15] Holy Ghost filled
[1:22:17] because all they say is look at these
[1:22:20] look at all the scary things out there
[1:22:22] but there's no way of Escape see some
[1:22:24] people seem to think that we can somehow
[1:22:26] trick the devil and we kind of trick
[1:22:28] past them and get into a rapture
[1:22:30] you know try and try to try and sneak
[1:22:32] past him look over there devil I see
[1:22:33] what you're doing yeah I got a body
[1:22:35] change this is not it's not going to
[1:22:37] work that way you can't outsmart the
[1:22:39] devil brother Brown said you can't
[1:22:41] outsmart them the only way to overcome
[1:22:42] them is by the holy ghost in your life
[1:22:46] Hallelujah but as I said there and you
[1:22:48] see the thing is these things are put on
[1:22:50] social media and everything to try and
[1:22:52] get our attention
[1:22:54] brother EDM would speak so and you know
[1:22:56] in his day he had TV and radio right he
[1:22:58] says and this morning while I was
[1:22:59] listening a few days ago to a broadcast
[1:23:00] it seemed to wanted to tell that
[1:23:02] creation was just saying um from some
[1:23:05] ashes blowing together and some
[1:23:06] phosphate and a few chemicals of the
[1:23:07] earth and the warm sunshine create the
[1:23:09] germ of life and brought out life how
[1:23:11] ridiculous when the sunshine will kill
[1:23:13] any Gem of Life lay a germ out in the
[1:23:15] sunshine or kill it immediately and
[1:23:17] there's no such a thing but Satan was
[1:23:19] trying to punch that at me
[1:23:22] and after I had taken my little Rebecca
[1:23:24] to school this morning and on the road
[1:23:25] back I started to turn the radio on
[1:23:27] again and I thought I would get into
[1:23:29] that stuff again so I just turned it
[1:23:32] back off
[1:23:33] so you got to realize these things it's
[1:23:35] not just radio it's on every media
[1:23:37] platform on the planet
[1:23:38] well what is it trying to do is trying
[1:23:40] to steal your joy it's trying to steal
[1:23:43] your Victory it's trying to steal your
[1:23:45] overcoming power and your love for God
[1:23:47] that's what it's trying to do but it's
[1:23:49] so it could be so invasive because this
[1:23:51] world is so connected but you see
[1:23:53] instead of actually no I'm going to
[1:23:54] listen to that I'm going to counter that
[1:23:55] I'm going to write an angle I'm going to
[1:23:56] write a blog I'm going to don't get
[1:23:58] caught up in that stuff
[1:24:00] there goes your bubbling you want to
[1:24:02] degas a Christian
[1:24:04] get them to listen to this stuff
[1:24:06] right but we should be bubbling all the
[1:24:08] time joy unspeakable full of Glory I
[1:24:12] mean as I said you know a while ago I've
[1:24:14] never seen a Christian who feeds on that
[1:24:15] kind of stuff and is happy
[1:24:17] they're always discontented they get all
[1:24:19] tense and stressed and burdened for the
[1:24:22] wrong things and word and all those
[1:24:23] problems all they see is those things
[1:24:25] and they can't see the wood for the
[1:24:27] trees because they can't see the very
[1:24:28] one who came to Rapture them is walking
[1:24:30] with them the same one that gave them
[1:24:32] joy in the beginning of their walk is
[1:24:34] still with them but because they've
[1:24:35] become so fixated on all that stuff they
[1:24:37] lose their Victory see the devil doesn't
[1:24:40] care how message we say we are he
[1:24:42] doesn't care how saved we think we are
[1:24:44] he doesn't care how much we think we
[1:24:46] know the Lord as long as God isn't
[1:24:48] living through us
[1:24:50] he wants to stop the life of God that's
[1:24:53] what he's doing he's not actually
[1:24:54] interested in stopping religion or
[1:24:56] churches he wants to stop the life of
[1:24:58] God putting on flesh that's what see see
[1:25:00] brother Brown said that actually on
[1:25:02] Pentecost you know when that happened
[1:25:04] the devil didn't roll out of bed nothing
[1:25:06] but then when the when when Peter and
[1:25:09] John
[1:25:10] went to the gate beautiful and saw the
[1:25:12] leper there and said Silver and Gold
[1:25:13] Have I None but such as I have I give
[1:25:15] unto thee and they raise him up he
[1:25:17] received strength and someone who was
[1:25:18] crippled by the door of the church ran
[1:25:20] and leaping and praising God that caused
[1:25:22] all the guns of hell to come out against
[1:25:24] the disciples why because what Jesus had
[1:25:27] done was now on them manifesting itself
[1:25:29] Christ was now in a multi-member body
[1:25:31] Hallelujah so he just wants to stop the
[1:25:34] Life of Christ manifesting through us
[1:25:36] well how did he stop that by pouring
[1:25:39] trying to pour all this stuff into us
[1:25:41] that we lose our joy we lose our freedom
[1:25:43] in the spirit we lose our love for God
[1:25:45] because the thing is if you if you want
[1:25:48] to help someone love the Lord
[1:25:50] if you really want to pull them out of
[1:25:52] the fire love the Lord and then that
[1:25:54] love will go to them
[1:25:56] amen
[1:25:58] Hallelujah we have so much good to talk
[1:26:01] about we that's why we have eternity to
[1:26:03] talk about it because we don't have

[1:33:54] Hallelujah
[1:33:56] praise the Lord
[1:33:57] hallelu it's going to finish with this
[1:33:59] now I said about the anointing that was
[1:34:01] on
[1:34:02] uh the two angels went down to Sodom
[1:34:05] that anointing us here to to to prepare
[1:34:07] people for a tribulation but as the
[1:34:09] anointing was on you know God himself
[1:34:11] became
[1:34:12] flesh there spoke to Abraham and Sarah
[1:34:15] changed their bodies changed from
[1:34:17] unbelief to Faith to have the promised
[1:34:19] son so God has come down in flesh in
[1:34:21] this day through the prophet Messenger
[1:34:23] to reveal himself to turn our hearts to
[1:34:26] Faith amen that goggin dwell in Us in
[1:34:28] faith right he can walk in us and now he
[1:34:31] came brother Brown said that that I
[1:34:33] think it was in the breach message he
[1:34:34] said the seventh angel which was him
[1:34:36] was on Earth at the time of this coming
[1:34:38] when the mighty Angel would come down
[1:34:40] Hallelujah and brother Barham through
[1:34:42] his mess you said he said the church
[1:34:44] fell from Pentecost we've got to get
[1:34:46] back to Pentecost right and what is the
[1:34:48] Pentecost the indwelling of the Holy
[1:34:50] Ghost I mean to write a book of Acts
[1:34:52] that God leads individuals not just a
[1:34:55] church not just a Ministry but we're
[1:34:56] individually led by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:34:59] signs and wonders are done amen we can
[1:35:01] see a book of Acts written we could
[1:35:04] Hallelujah if we put it down on paper we
[1:35:06] would say this is this is chapter one I
[1:35:09] mean you know praise God
[1:35:11] isn't that true Hallelujah we've seen
[1:35:13] him live and he's still going to keep
[1:35:15] living yeah yeah so I saw another Mighty
[1:35:17] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:35:19] the cloud and as rainbow uh uh and a
[1:35:22] rainbow was upon his head his face as it
[1:35:23] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:35:26] Fire
[1:35:27] amen and he had in his hand a little
[1:35:29] book open and set us right foot upon the
[1:35:31] sea is left foot upon the earth now we
[1:35:34] don't have time to go into it but you
[1:35:35] read in the Book of Revelation that the
[1:35:36] Beast Powers come out of these two
[1:35:38] places right because the sea is
[1:35:41] multitudes of people's tongues and
[1:35:42] Nations right that b systems come out
[1:35:44] well it's Rome right it's the Roman
[1:35:46] Catholic church and her daughters it's a
[1:35:48] political system not just religious
[1:35:50] right but then also but then also that
[1:35:52] that Beast that looked like a Lambert
[1:35:54] speakers the dragon came out of the
[1:35:56] earth America right they are working
[1:35:59] together yes
[1:36:00] you say oh no that's terrible no but
[1:36:03] listen where are his feet
[1:36:06] one his feet were his pillars of Fire
[1:36:08] whatever the day of Pentecost you could
[1:36:10] say his feet came down his body came
[1:36:12] down right well the head chip came down
[1:36:14] but wherever his feet are in you and I
[1:36:16] right because he's the pillar of fire
[1:36:18] comes down into you and I now where do
[1:36:20] whose feet stand he stands on those two
[1:36:23] places that those Powers come out of
[1:36:25] that's why we can Rejoice we don't have
[1:36:27] to be all caught up in fear of all the
[1:36:29] devil's going to get us and we're going
[1:36:30] to be you know he's going to trap her
[1:36:31] somewhere no we won't be closed up we'll
[1:36:34] be taken up amen we do not walk into a
[1:36:38] time when we can't by ourselves that's
[1:36:40] in the Great Tribulation the bride has
[1:36:42] gone to Glory at that time it doesn't
[1:36:44] matter how much the Machinery the devil
[1:36:46] sits up doesn't matter he can just be a
[1:36:49] basically a
[1:36:50] click away and it can all be there it
[1:36:53] doesn't matter how close he is yeah he
[1:36:55] cannot do a thing until we're gone
[1:36:57] Hallelujah
[1:36:59] hey amen that makes me happy
[1:37:01] that's why I say we're not driving like
[1:37:03] some people think into a slow-moving car
[1:37:05] crash
[1:37:06] no we are Marching up into Glory
[1:37:09] amen so where is his feet were his
[1:37:11] pillars of fire where is that pillow
[1:37:13] fire today that's not just in a
[1:37:14] photograph it's in you and I amen that
[1:37:17] anointing is in you and I Hallelujah
[1:37:20] yeah amen then you know we'd already
[1:37:23] cried with the you know he cried with a
[1:37:24] loud voice of the lion Roth and when he
[1:37:26] cried seven Thunders out of their voices
[1:37:27] and when the seven Thunders had out of
[1:37:29] their voices I was about to write I
[1:37:30] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:37:32] seal up those things which are seven
[1:37:34] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[1:37:35] the angel which I saw
[1:37:37] um stand upon the sea upon the Earth
[1:37:39] lifted up his hand to heaven and he
[1:37:41] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:37:42] ever who created heaven the things that
[1:37:44] there and are and the Earth are things
[1:37:45] that there and are and the Sea and the
[1:37:47] things that there and are that that
[1:37:48] there should be time no longer he's
[1:37:51] swearing by himself because he made all
[1:37:53] things this is Christ in Angelic form we
[1:37:55] understand that it means he's swearing
[1:37:57] by himself is that time should be no
[1:37:59] longer means there shall be no more
[1:38:01] delay
[1:38:02] Hallelujah the things that have been
[1:38:04] going on for seven Church ages since
[1:38:05] since the day of Pentecost has been a
[1:38:07] delay of the promises and the answers of
[1:38:09] God now comes a season where there's I'm
[1:38:11] going to wind it all up I'm going to
[1:38:13] wind up my Plan of Redemption I'm going
[1:38:15] to gather my bride to myself she's going
[1:38:17] to go on a Rapture the dead in Christ
[1:38:18] are going to rise and the devil in all
[1:38:20] of us schemes can't stop me
[1:38:22] the devil can't stop God
[1:38:24] he can't stop him you can look you can
[1:38:26] go through the Bible just do a study on
[1:38:28] God being undefeated
[1:38:30] Hallelujah and the scoreboard was always
[1:38:33] God wins Satan loses yes Hallelujah and
[1:38:37] and and and and if that's the
[1:38:40] what do you call it the recurring theme
[1:38:41] and we're living in Bible days it'll
[1:38:44] continue on
[1:38:45] hallelujah amen that makes me happy amen
[1:38:48] there shall be no more delay you say
[1:38:50] well I've been praying for things for
[1:38:51] such a long time when's it going to
[1:38:52] happen it's going to happen there shall
[1:38:54] be no more delay he said I'm going to
[1:38:56] wind up my plan
[1:38:57] I remember in the days of the voice of
[1:38:59] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:39:00] sell the mystery of God should be
[1:39:01] finished as he has declared to his
[1:39:03] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:39:04] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[1:39:06] again say go take that little book which
[1:39:08] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:39:10] standeth upon the scene upon the Earth
[1:39:12] and I went unto the angel said unto them
[1:39:13] give me the little book and he said unto
[1:39:15] me take it eat it up as you'll make thy
[1:39:17] Valley bitter bit of a mouth that shall
[1:39:19] be sweet as honey I took the little book
[1:39:21] out of the Angel's hand ate it up and as
[1:39:22] it was in my mouth sweet as honey as
[1:39:24] soon as I had eaten my belly was bitter
[1:39:26] and he said unto me down must prophesy
[1:39:27] again before many people's Nations
[1:39:29] tongues and Kings now we know John
[1:39:31] himself after the Isle of Patmos he went
[1:39:34] back to Ephesus and he passed the church
[1:39:36] there he didn't fulfill this but John
[1:39:38] was symbolic in the book as as
[1:39:39] everything else is symbolic so one man
[1:39:42] is actually a symbol of the the bride at
[1:39:44] the end time Hallelujah so and that's
[1:39:47] why we know when you when you actually
[1:39:48] partake of the word when you eat the
[1:39:50] word it's sweet in your mouth because
[1:39:52] all the promises are God how good he is
[1:39:54] the sweet but it's better in the valley
[1:39:55] because it's got to purge out the old
[1:39:57] life
[1:39:58] Hallelujah
[1:40:00] but you see now we have a commission in
[1:40:02] the same time we must prophesy again so
[1:40:04] what's already been spoken we must speak
[1:40:06] it under inspiration see it's not just
[1:40:08] us pointing back in history saying God
[1:40:10] did this here and God did this here but
[1:40:12] no we can say no that same God is alive
[1:40:14] today I mean we see him do the same
[1:40:16] things I mean we see him fulfill his
[1:40:18] word in our lives holy what is that that
[1:40:19] is prophesying again amen the bride
[1:40:22] around the world is prophesying again
[1:40:24] why because we're being restored back to
[1:40:27] a real Pentecost I mean with God himself
[1:40:30] comes and dwells Amen in his body upon
[1:40:33] the Earth Hallelujah that's why we can
[1:40:35] Rejoice this morning why because because
[1:40:37] when God came down and dwelt in in the
[1:40:39] disciples every single claim the devil
[1:40:42] had upon them was struck off amen amen
[1:40:44] because what God can only dwell truly in
[1:40:46] a person that's being purged from sin
[1:40:49] that's what the blood does takes all
[1:40:51] those desires that all those things he
[1:40:53] comes and dwells in us and God is saying
[1:40:55] this is mine
[1:40:56] this is mine just like when he died on
[1:40:58] Calvary he poured his blood upon the
[1:41:00] Earth he's saying I am claiming this
[1:41:02] Earth
[1:41:02] we're part of the Earth are we not amen
[1:41:05] then he comes down with a fiery baptism
[1:41:06] Burns Out The Devils out of our life
[1:41:08] sure in this flesh sure we're overcoming
[1:41:11] things but God is saying you are mine
[1:41:12] child you don't belong to the devil you
[1:41:15] never did you never will you were mine
[1:41:16] and I'm claiming you this way
[1:41:19] Hallelujah
[1:41:21] praise God
[1:41:23] amen now you see we're living in such an
[1:41:26] awesome time where God is pouring out
[1:41:28] his Spirit more and more
[1:41:30] Hallelujah see we're not
[1:41:32] we are not we are not here just pointing
[1:41:35] back into history
[1:41:36] amen we are here see I found it hard I
[1:41:38] wanted to find a picture where
[1:41:39] everyone's screaming and rejoicing when
[1:41:41] the Holy Ghost fell upon him because
[1:41:43] that's really what happens to someone
[1:41:44] they something happens to them amen they
[1:41:47] come out of that experience with a
[1:41:48] different life Hallelujah I don't know
[1:41:51] you know you know not all of our
[1:41:52] experiences are the same but when you
[1:41:54] come out of that time you know you're
[1:41:55] different Something's Happened To You
[1:41:57] amen and Mary was there she was
[1:41:59] staggering like a drunk woman amen
[1:42:02] Rejoice against shouting amen if Mary
[1:42:03] went to Pentecost now that same kind of
[1:42:05] thing amen we won't get to heaven with a
[1:42:07] dry-eyed confession
[1:42:09] Hallelujah
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:13] amen we're here I'll just I'm just
[1:42:15] trying to find a I'm just going to
[1:42:17] finish with this I'll just wind up with
[1:42:19] this this quote here see many people
[1:42:21] think that the the enemy has to squeeze
[1:42:24] us enough
[1:42:26] for then the spoken word to happen
[1:42:28] and they're thinking the squeeze will
[1:42:30] put us in condition for it to happen I
[1:42:32] say the squeeze is already happening
[1:42:34] we've already been squeezed there's
[1:42:36] already a persecution against us
[1:42:39] I don't know if you've realized it but
[1:42:40] you know we're called a cult or a sect
[1:42:43] all those antichrists whatever more
[1:42:46] we're called that yeah
[1:42:48] yeah if they call Jesus Bells above how
[1:42:50] much will they call the Servants of the
[1:42:51] house right so so there is a there is a
[1:42:54] squeeze already upon us so what are we
[1:42:56] waiting for right and we've come to this
[1:42:58] point here
[1:42:59] where it used to be and this is this is
[1:43:01] a thought that came to you when I was up
[1:43:03] and up in Auckland see there was there
[1:43:05] there was you know all all these
[1:43:07] different churches that come together to
[1:43:08] rejoice and worship God
[1:43:10] and but it didn't used to be that way
[1:43:13] it didn't used to be that way
[1:43:15] there was there was always a separation
[1:43:17] and a gulf and different things but you
[1:43:18] see now it's just like with these ducks
[1:43:20] here
[1:43:21] you know this farmer had some ducks he
[1:43:23] put fences around to keep the duck
[1:43:25] separated and the Ducks maybe you know
[1:43:27] you could maybe used to be in the past
[1:43:28] you could hear the quacking of some
[1:43:30] other church somewhere or a Believer and
[1:43:32] say I think they sound like a Believer
[1:43:33] but I'm not sure I can't see them you
[1:43:35] know because things can mimic things
[1:43:37] right but then now what caused the
[1:43:39] fences to go it wasn't the Ducks pushing
[1:43:41] the fences down it wasn't the farmer who
[1:43:43] wanted to separate them pull the fences
[1:43:45] down no it was just the water being
[1:43:47] poured in I meant a flood taking place
[1:43:49] and lifted all the Ducks up so at first
[1:43:51] you know where they could just hear each
[1:43:53] other there's a bit of mistrust well I'm
[1:43:56] in this church and they're in that
[1:43:57] church and you know there was like a
[1:43:59] it's like a parliament in a way that's
[1:44:01] how it used to be but then when the
[1:44:03] water came in and lifted the Ducks up
[1:44:05] above the fence and they saw each other
[1:44:06] eye to eye they realize they know the
[1:44:09] same Jesus I do
[1:44:10] they've had the same kind of experiences
[1:44:12] I've had they've faced the same battles
[1:44:14] they believe the same word amen that we
[1:44:16] are ducks
[1:44:18] Hallelujah we don't just have a duck man
[1:44:20] we're all ducks Hallelujah
[1:44:22] but what was it doing it's bringing a
[1:44:25] Unity among the bride of Christ so but
[1:44:27] what causes us this is the rainfall and
[1:44:29] cause it to happen what does the water
[1:44:31] represent here the rain is the spirit of
[1:44:33] God he's pouring himself out more and
[1:44:36] more he's moving more and more why to
[1:44:38] take away all the Lift us up above all
[1:44:41] the fences of our past and pains and
[1:44:44] hurts and complexes mistrust
[1:44:45] misunderstandings past fighting between
[1:44:48] churches and passes away more we're
[1:44:50] lifted up all above that now we're
[1:44:52] living in a different season amen and
[1:44:54] when the water rises like this what
[1:44:55] happens now the wind begins to blow upon
[1:44:57] the pond and a swarming takes place do
[1:45:00] you know you're swarming I don't know
[1:45:02] but you've realized but your life is
[1:45:04] actually you're swarming like a bunch of
[1:45:05] ducks about to migrate Hallelujah that's
[1:45:08] why we get excited when we hear the word
[1:45:10] hallelujah's bringing the road we're
[1:45:11] going to dance and rejoice and be so
[1:45:13] happy in our hearts what's that that's a
[1:45:14] swarming amen so now now we're in
[1:45:17] condition now to take a flight
[1:45:20] Hallelujah you say well there's a cold
[1:45:23] wind blowing upon the pond and you know
[1:45:25] there's the you can see ice you know
[1:45:26] because you're the Ducks they migrate
[1:45:28] what from Southern America up to I mean
[1:45:30] you're like Louisiana up to Canada right
[1:45:32] and then when it becomes Autumn or fall
[1:45:34] in Canada they they migrate back down to
[1:45:36] Louisiana where it's warmer so the world
[1:45:38] gets colder it gets harder it gets less
[1:45:41] comfortable to be in
[1:45:43] now if you're caught up in that you'll
[1:45:45] be like a duck with a hair dryer trying
[1:45:48] to trying to blow or trying to heat up
[1:45:50] the world trying to get rid of all the
[1:45:51] frost this is what a lot of Christians
[1:45:53] are trying to do we're going to fix this
[1:45:55] world yeah we're going to do it
[1:45:57] ain't gonna work right but if you're
[1:46:00] listening to the right kind of a Drake
[1:46:02] amen the certain voice of God right then
[1:46:05] what what will happen you'll realize no
[1:46:07] I'm going to drop the hair dryer I'm
[1:46:09] going to drop the conspiracy stuff and
[1:46:10] all the stuff that keeps me Earthbound
[1:46:12] and stressed and tensed and worried I'm
[1:46:14] going to listen to the Head drag the
[1:46:16] Holy Ghost because I'm getting ready to
[1:46:18] take a flight I mean you can stand there
[1:46:20] and try and yeah I've never seen that
[1:46:21] happen but you know he will try to fix
[1:46:23] this world with man-made things we're
[1:46:25] going to man make you know
[1:46:27] you know bring the gospel to the World
[1:46:28] by a man's organization they'll never do
[1:46:31] it but the bride of Christ will go and
[1:46:33] get the elect yes and then we're going
[1:46:34] to go home
