[44:10] Lord we just commit the service and your
[44:11] hands Lord meet every need for your
[44:13] glory Lord and your wonderful name name
[44:15] Lord Jesus Christ we ask amen
[44:18] I mean god bless you friends you may
[44:20] have your seats this morning and I want
[44:22] to speak about I want to speak about the
[44:24] heart today and I know this is a very
[44:26] big subject but I want to take maybe a
[44:29] bit of it but we from you know from
[44:32] reading the sum we can see David was in
[44:35] a time of great distress he was talking
[44:37] about as enemies are there to to destroy
[44:39] him and to take his life and but we see
[44:42] that you know the Psalms are really your
[44:46] the Psalms to me it wasn't just a theory
[44:49] you know David just wasn't sitting in
[44:50] his palace and thinking of a nice song
[44:52] to sing and how to ride it and the good
[44:54] lyrics and the good you know he wasn't
[44:55] thinking about that but he was
[44:56] experiencing something and and the
[45:00] experience as he is going through in
[45:01] life was actually producing the Psalms
[45:03] so everything that happens in our lives
[45:06] will actually will bring something out
[45:08] of us right and either make us better or
[45:10] make us better amen and it will really
[45:13] bring out what's what's within us you
[45:15] know you know in a time of crisis is
[45:17] really someone's true character really
[45:18] will come out you know where they come
[45:20] under fire or you know people can be
[45:22] yo-yo fills in the military you know
[45:24] there and you know sure anyone can March
[45:26] run on the parade ground and say I'm I'm
[45:28] the best soldier in the unit but it's
[45:29] really when they're in the foxhole and
[45:31] maybe the enemy shooting at them it'll
[45:32] really bring out what's with them then
[45:34] and it's the same thing with us you know
[45:36] we we walk through this life's journey
[45:38] and what is in our hearts comes out you
[45:41] know to me when when David was was
[45:43] saying in that Psalm Lord when you try
[45:45] my heart maybe I'll just find it here he
[45:47] says you know when he says when he says
[45:51] in verse three you know thou has proved
[45:53] my heart thou has visited me in the
[45:55] night that was tried me and shall find
[45:57] nothing now to me he's not saying you're
[46:01] I just avoid heart you know you know we
[46:03] had you know we know the heart is the
[46:04] emotion is the intellect that's you know
[46:06] many many things but you know he's not
[46:09] saying you just find some void zombie
[46:11] right you won't just find an emptiness
[46:13] but what he's saying is that this this
[46:16] word nothing it actually means a failure
[46:17] in the Hebrew ceases when you try me and
[46:21] we since when now has proved my heart it
[46:23] means it means that God has tested us
[46:25] hard
[46:26] and remember when God is God God brings
[46:29] us through something he's not trying to
[46:31] make us look like failures remember all
[46:34] the believers in the scripture you take
[46:35] the Hebrew children they went into their
[46:37] trial they came out victorious right
[46:39] Joshua you know took the land you know
[46:41] David overcame his enemies you know
[46:43] Daniel go through every trial he came
[46:46] out victorious for the trials that came
[46:47] in their lives wasn't actually God
[46:49] trying to trip them up and say see I
[46:50] told you so you know you're useless no
[46:52] God was actually proving what was within
[46:54] them but in a positive way and even when
[46:57] God puts a finger on our lives saying
[46:58] look you're proud you've got this
[47:00] arrogance you've got you you're
[47:02] indifferent whatever it may be when God
[47:03] puts a finger and he wants to take that
[47:05] out of you that his nature can come
[47:07] forth
[47:07] I'll Lou you so it's really all good
[47:09] when we get put through the wringer I
[47:10] mean God is actually you know doing us a
[47:13] favor so so David is saying he says thou
[47:16] shall find nothing that word Mexi means
[47:18] a failure so so when God will precess
[47:21] when God will prove me and try me you
[47:23] know he will not find any failure in his
[47:25] heart I mean I'm sure this is how we all
[47:28] want to be Lord when you try us when you
[47:30] really seek search the depths of our
[47:32] ourselves that only he can he'll find
[47:35] nothing that's a fault I mean so but you
[47:39] know David as are saying he would he
[47:41] would write these songs because
[47:43] something was happening in his life and
[47:45] even the son we we just read you my
[47:47] Bible says it's a prayer of David and
[47:49] you know so so he would he would come
[47:51] under times of great distress you know I
[47:52] you know I love the scripture how you
[47:54] know all of all of David's victories are
[47:57] there but all David's great failures are
[47:59] there you know his you know is his
[48:01] distress has his worry has anguish as
[48:03] trouble you know all the buts no doubt
[48:05] maybe he would say please don't write
[48:07] that down about me they were written
[48:08] down but God would allow that to see
[48:10] that all believers a human way even the
[48:12] scriptures say that Elijah was a man of
[48:14] passions I was just like you and I I
[48:16] mean so they weren't like superstars
[48:18] that were just a beyond and nothing
[48:20] touched him a bother though they were
[48:22] real people and that we threw the ring
[48:24] of the Oh David had many close scrapes
[48:25] in his life and you know but but God you
[48:28] know and and he had great sin in his
[48:30] life - it's amazing when you would you
[48:32] know I don't know if you've hurt
[48:33] anyone's compared the sins of Saul to
[48:35] the sons of David your the sins of David
[48:37] who far outweigh you know now human mind
[48:39] the sins of Saul but yet David David
[48:42] didn't get kicked off the throne because
[48:44] of what he did because God was
[48:45] determined he said no no this is a man
[48:47] after my own heart so it doesn't matter
[48:49] what he's done
[48:50] Amen but because the reason he's a man
[48:53] after his own heart is because he was
[48:55] quick to repent he was quick to say I'm
[48:57] wrong when you're when Nathan the
[48:59] Prophet came in and this was apparently
[49:01] two years after the fact that he had you
[49:03] know Uriah killed he took Bathsheba it
[49:06] was two years after the fact that Nathan
[49:08] came to him and told him the parable of
[49:10] unity or two men and one man had a lot
[49:12] of sheep another man had one sheep and
[49:14] then the rich man who had all the Sheep
[49:15] you know he here to visitor cam come
[49:17] instead of taking one of his own sheep
[49:19] to to killing and AH and an offer for
[49:21] dinner he took the poor man cheap and
[49:23] your David knows he bigoted guru angry
[49:25] and you know yo watch it under this man
[49:27] he should be killed you know then david
[49:30] points a finger i mean Nathan points the
[49:31] finger David you're the man and David
[49:34] thought he got away with it but God saw
[49:36] it why but as soon as as soon as God
[49:39] pointed that out to David I knew what
[49:41] you did he was quick to repent
[49:43] haloo you and we must realize that the
[49:46] zeal of our age when you go to the lady
[49:48] you see in church age it says be zealous
[49:50] and repent I mean so the zeal of our age
[49:53] is actually to repent right to
[49:55] acknowledge when we're wrong not from
[49:57] our heart I mean he sorry not from our
[49:59] mind because it's expected of us like
[50:01] Kelly yo you go to your children
[50:04] say you're sorry you know what do you
[50:06] say now I'm sorry but that's like an
[50:09] expect that it's very different from a
[50:10] heart when they say I'm sorry dad to win
[50:12] I'm sorry dad
[50:13] you know because you know the first one
[50:16] is the one you want to see the second
[50:17] one well that's just expected behavior
[50:19] but expected behavior is not going to
[50:22] produce what we you know it's not going
[50:24] to make the person into a person we want
[50:26] to see right that's the same thing being
[50:27] a believer and it
[50:28] expected behavior is not gonna is not
[50:31] what God is looking for you know sure we
[50:33] have a lot of expected behavior you know
[50:35] just even subliminally there's there's
[50:37] there's expected behavior of how church
[50:39] should be and how we should dress and
[50:40] the things we should say in the yeah but
[50:42] if it's all just an expected learn
[50:44] behavior and not from our heart there's
[50:47] no relationship with God but if it's
[50:50] from our hearts Amen God because God is
[50:52] looking for a people after his own heart
[50:53] just like he said when he when when when
[50:56] samuel was going to to anoint David
[50:58] samuel was told by god i have a king
[51:01] who's a man after my own heart god david
[51:04] was already in that in that condition
[51:06] before Samuel anointed him King and it's
[51:09] the same thing with you and I even
[51:10] before God came by our way he said you
[51:13] know what did he do he he sent a prophet
[51:15] in age to anoint this world you're
[51:17] annoyed this world anoint this age I
[51:19] mean to anoint that people because he
[51:21] was looking for a bride which is after
[51:23] his own heart I mean and we were
[51:25] actually already in that condition I
[51:27] mean before God ever found us I mean but
[51:29] the course there's a lot of things that
[51:30] are being taken out hallelujah right of
[51:32] our hearts but we're already in that
[51:34] condition because he's looking for a
[51:35] part of himself Amen just like Adam and
[51:38] Eve member Eve was part of Adam you know
[51:41] Adam didn't go to Eve world your bone of
[51:43] my bone flesh of my flesh life of my
[51:45] life because she is the only other woman
[51:47] there you know you'll do because you're
[51:49] the only one know that death that's not
[51:51] what he was saying he's saying no
[51:52] actually you're part of me we're
[51:54] actually one person I mean what I am you
[51:57] are what you are I am we actually make
[51:59] one whole I mean it's what God comes and
[52:01] found us because actually not a we're
[52:03] part of him right this is what this
[52:05] message is comes through just like Adam
[52:07] telling Eve who she was I mean God comes
[52:09] shows us ourselves in the scripture
[52:10] saying you're bone of my bone flesh of
[52:12] my flesh life of my life you are me
[52:14] hallelujah amen so you know I say you
[52:19] know as I go through these things and
[52:20] and we'll probably only touch maybe the
[52:22] tops and the sides but you know whenever
[52:25] we think of the heart we think oh you
[52:26] know we kind of shell up a bit what's in
[52:29] there you know we all have this humanity
[52:31] we wrestle with and God's got a deal and
[52:35] take things out sure but that doesn't
[52:37] take away our election that doesn't put
[52:39] our salvation in jeopardy right member
[52:42] god
[52:42] say remember he never says to anyone
[52:44] sort your life out and then I'll give
[52:46] you eternal life never did it's just not
[52:50] in Scripture that's not biblical
[52:51] Christianity so your life out now you
[52:53] really know no God takes us washes us
[52:57] carlier seals us into the kingdom and as
[53:00] we walk with Him he sorts our life out
[53:01] right because we're going from glory to
[53:03] glory as we walk with Him with we're
[53:05] becoming more like him I mean but David
[53:08] could stand there you know he could
[53:10] write the Psalms and to me it's
[53:11] incredible because the Psalms were
[53:13] written by a man that God testified
[53:16] testified to to to samuel saying this is
[53:20] a man after my own heart and it's i
[53:21] think it's the only recorder in the
[53:23] scripture where God says this is a man
[53:25] after my own heart
[53:26] but the Psalms are full of David writing
[53:29] about people's hearts he talks about the
[53:31] wicked he talks about the righteous he
[53:33] goes beyond the external and he begins
[53:35] to write about what's inside people and
[53:38] and to me it's amazing because David
[53:42] when he was writing the Psalms he
[53:45] actually experienced what he was writing
[53:47] about when he said their enemies
[53:49] compassing about him there were enemies
[53:51] come Boz ground when he had to when he
[53:53] says there was trouble and things going
[53:55] on there was troubles right and you know
[53:57] the trouble wasn't that dinner was late
[53:59] in the palace you know there was real
[54:00] trouble he was on the run he was you
[54:02] know he had to do a lot of stuff he
[54:04] survived a lot of scrapes right you know
[54:06] so so he experienced what he wrote and
[54:09] we know that any true any true song from
[54:12] God is actually based or you know any
[54:15] any song or or story about God or
[54:18] anything that's expressed as actually
[54:20] based on a revelation causes an
[54:22] experience right you take you know you
[54:25] know you take the song it is well with
[54:27] my soul you know I'm sure we're all
[54:28] familiar with thee with the author of
[54:31] the well well what happened to the
[54:32] author of that of that song you know he
[54:36] didn't just sit there and say well those
[54:38] are cool lyrics you know when peace like
[54:39] a river attendeth my way when sorrows
[54:42] like sea billows roll whatever my lot
[54:44] thou has taught me to say it is well it
[54:47] is well with my soul Amy says yo though
[54:51] Satan should Buffett though trials
[54:52] should come let this blest assurance
[54:55] control
[54:56] all that Christ has regarded my helpless
[54:58] estate and has shed his own blood for my
[55:02] soul he didn't just write that because
[55:04] it sounded cool he experienced a lot of
[55:07] hardship remember that that that
[55:09] hardship formed him a certain way
[55:11] there's actually that this song was an
[55:14] expression of everything he went through
[55:16] just like David with the sons now now
[55:18] the man who who wrote the son was his
[55:22] nail
[55:22] song rather is called Horatio Spafford
[55:25] and he had great trauma in his life that
[55:29] led him to writing this thus the song so
[55:31] the first one was was the death of his
[55:33] four-year-old son and the Great Fire of
[55:36] Chicago of 1871 so so so he lost his son
[55:41] there and then he was financially ruined
[55:43] because that fire and it wasn't just
[55:46] that but then but then he planned to
[55:48] travel back to Europe with his family
[55:50] and then Anna late change of plan he
[55:53] sent his family hit of him while he
[55:56] delayed your sorting out business and
[55:58] things following that that Great Chicago
[56:00] Fire but while his family crossed the
[56:04] Atlantic the ship sank rapidly and he
[56:07] lost his four daughters and that in that
[56:11] shipwreck his wife Anna survived and
[56:14] sent him now the famous telegram that
[56:17] said saved alone surely afterwards as
[56:21] expected travel to meet his his grieving
[56:23] wife he was inspired to write these
[56:26] words as a ship passed near where his
[56:28] daughters had died amen he went through
[56:33] great trial he suffered great loss and
[56:36] he suffered that great loss that God
[56:40] would inspire him through that great
[56:41] loss to write it as well with my soul
[56:43] and then now we can stand and sing that
[56:46] song it can mean so much for us because
[56:48] of the hardship I mean I've never lost
[56:51] four daughters I've never lost a son
[56:52] I've never been financially ruined I've
[56:55] never walked in his shoes but because he
[56:58] walked through those great trials I mean
[57:00] we can enjoy a song that was that that
[57:02] that God inspired in his life I mean
[57:05] because because of what happened to him
[57:07] I mean so so
[57:09] to me it's an incredible song because it
[57:11] wasn't written because it sounded cool
[57:13] but because it was an experience just
[57:14] like the Psalms or an experience now
[57:16] it's amazing when you look at the
[57:18] Apostle Paul and we know the Apostle
[57:21] Paul was you know you know he didn't sit
[57:23] in an ivory tower in Jerusalem and and
[57:25] write letters to people you know he
[57:27] doesn't you know yo-yo he wasn't some
[57:29] lofty academic he loved what he
[57:31] experienced and so it's amazing win win
[57:34] win the Apostle Paul sees God allows you
[57:37] to even take the best sermons that that
[57:40] have ever been preached on the earth has
[57:41] been based on an experience that God
[57:44] actually causes you know either the
[57:46] songwriter or the musician or the
[57:48] preacher ever maybe actually to
[57:50] experience a lot of things and then all
[57:52] those experiences God would bring a
[57:54] revelation upon them and then and then
[57:56] it would be preached for I mean you take
[57:58] brother on spin say man he's been
[58:00] through the fire he's been through a lot
[58:01] of hardship I mean but because of those
[58:03] things he can stand and say take courage
[58:05] hallelujah amen he can stand he can
[58:07] preach mighty things because he's been
[58:09] through a lot right it's not an academic
[58:11] theory and so when the Apostle Paul
[58:13] would stand in and-and-and he would
[58:15] write to the Romans and he would say
[58:17] what shall we say into these things if
[58:19] God be for us who can be against us
[58:22] remember he had a lot of opposition both
[58:24] without and within a ment he that spared
[58:27] not his own son but delivered him up for
[58:29] us all how shall he not with him also
[58:32] freely give us all things who shall lay
[58:35] thanks to the charge of God's elect that
[58:36] is God the justifier who is he that
[58:38] condemneth that is Christ that died
[58:40] you'd rather that is risen again who is
[58:43] even at the right hand of God who maketh
[58:45] intercession for us who shall separate
[58:48] us from the love of Christ shall
[58:50] tribulation now remember he went through
[58:52] tribulation or distress he had great
[58:54] distress or persecution he had great
[58:57] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[59:00] peril or sword he experienced all those
[59:02] things but they can stand there and say
[59:04] no nothing can separate us from the love
[59:06] of God which is in Christ he says as it
[59:08] is written for thy sake we are killed
[59:10] all the day long we are accounted as
[59:12] sheep for the slaughter now in all these
[59:14] things we are more than conquerors
[59:16] through him that loved us for I am
[59:17] persuaded that neither death nor life
[59:19] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[59:21] nor things present nor things
[59:23] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[59:25] creature shall be able to suppress from
[59:28] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[59:30] our Lord
[59:30] and because he experienced that he could
[59:32] write it down hallelujah but we can
[59:36] understand it was more than just you
[59:37] know women reading we read the writings
[59:39] of Paul or maybe the Psalms of David or
[59:42] whatever it may be we're not feeding off
[59:43] their intellect we're not just feeding
[59:46] off their experience but God takes her
[59:48] experiences anoints it Amen and uses it
[59:51] for his glory Amy remember that was a
[59:55] revelation to him and now I know this is
[59:57] part one of my favorite pieces of
[59:58] scripture but you know when he would he
[1:00:00] would write to the Ephesians and and he
[1:00:02] would begin what we call chapter two of
[1:00:04] the book of Ephesians he said and you
[1:00:06] had he quickened who were dead in
[1:00:08] trespasses and sins remember this is not
[1:00:09] all this is not a mental exercise to him
[1:00:12] this is not a theory to him he
[1:00:13] experienced this he knew was like to be
[1:00:16] quickened we knew his you're on there
[1:00:17] other on the road to Damascus and you
[1:00:19] know God came down since it's Lord who
[1:00:21] are you he was made alive hallelujah he
[1:00:24] was he was dead in trespasses but he
[1:00:26] became alive it was an experience amen
[1:00:29] I mean we're in times past ye walked
[1:00:31] according to the course of this world
[1:00:33] hallelujah he he used to do that he was
[1:00:36] a Pharisee of the Pharisees member
[1:00:38] doesn't matter what people do outside of
[1:00:40] Christ they're walking to the course of
[1:00:42] this world doesn't matter what
[1:00:44] profession they may take it's not just a
[1:00:47] drunkard on the street that does that
[1:00:48] you can be religious and do that I mean
[1:00:50] so so he knows what that was like
[1:00:51] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:00:53] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:00:55] the children of disobedience among whom
[1:00:58] also we all had our conversation in
[1:01:01] times past cease he's putting himself
[1:01:03] because he knew what was like I'm in the
[1:01:05] lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:01:07] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[1:01:09] were pardon me by nature the children of
[1:01:12] Wrath even as others but God who is rich
[1:01:14] in mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:01:17] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:01:21] hath quickened us together with Christ
[1:01:22] by grace ye are saved and has raised us
[1:01:25] up together and made us sit together in
[1:01:27] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:01:30] the ages to come he might show the
[1:01:32] exceeding riches of His grace and his
[1:01:35] kindness towards us through Christ Jesus
[1:01:37] but by grace ye are saved through faith
[1:01:39] and that is not of yourselves as the
[1:01:41] gift of God not of works lest any man
[1:01:43] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:01:46] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:01:47] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:01:50] should walk in them I meant he knew what
[1:01:52] I was like he experienced it hallelujah
[1:01:55] you take the first song that's ever
[1:01:58] recorded in the scripture it would be
[1:02:01] written by a man called Moses they just
[1:02:04] crossed the Red Sea and it was more than
[1:02:06] just crossing a Red Sea they saw their
[1:02:08] enemies try and pursue them remember on
[1:02:10] the other side of the Red Sea there was
[1:02:11] a lot of distress you know you know
[1:02:14] you're the people of Israel would even
[1:02:15] try and turn against Moses and Moses
[1:02:17] will begin to cry out unto the Lord say
[1:02:19] lord help us
[1:02:20] and then God just actually said the
[1:02:22] Moses way crying just Speaker move
[1:02:23] forward so there was a lot of distress
[1:02:25] on that side of the Red Sea but on the
[1:02:27] other side once they came through the
[1:02:29] trial and they could look back and see
[1:02:30] their enemy was drowned and dead Hollyer
[1:02:33] then then the inspiration struck the
[1:02:35] prophet and he began to sing a song
[1:02:37] hallelujah hallelujah it was more than
[1:02:39] just an intellectual thing it was an
[1:02:41] experience they had just seen their
[1:02:43] enemy drowned they'd seen their
[1:02:44] taskmasters destroyed hallelujah and
[1:02:47] it's the same thing with you and I when
[1:02:48] we can look into the blood of Jesus
[1:02:50] Christ and see our sins are gone I mean
[1:02:52] the things and ones afflict us are being
[1:02:54] destroyed how they our sins are being
[1:02:55] eradicated I mean it should give us such
[1:02:58] a voice I should give us such a praise
[1:03:00] in our hearts hallelujah that's more
[1:03:02] than just knowing about Calvary but
[1:03:04] you've experienced Calvary it's more
[1:03:05] than just knowing about the blood you've
[1:03:07] experienced the blood I mean you forgive
[1:03:09] you you've experienced it's a turning
[1:03:11] power what it's done for you hallelujah
[1:03:15] amen so Moses begin to sing cause as a
[1:03:18] revelation
[1:03:19] oh yeah it's amazing because in that
[1:03:23] song he would he would sing about how
[1:03:25] the horse and the rider are cast into
[1:03:26] the sea and he would speak about those
[1:03:28] ones were yo that the Lord is a man of
[1:03:31] war and you know the Lord is his name
[1:03:33] and Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts
[1:03:35] were cast into the sea his chosen
[1:03:37] captains also drowned in the Red Sea and
[1:03:39] you know he'd speak about that but then
[1:03:41] he'd began to prophesy iners in a song
[1:03:43] saying about the hearts of the kings of
[1:03:46] Moab would fail anyone and Felicity and
[1:03:48] all those things and they're going to
[1:03:49] take the land
[1:03:50] I mean so it's amazing how how how an
[1:03:53] experience of what's just happened
[1:03:54] connects you also predict the vision
[1:03:56] into the future I mean that if the Lord
[1:03:58] has brought us thus far we're going to
[1:04:00] take a body change I mean if the Lord
[1:04:02] has brought us out of sin and unbelief
[1:04:03] and all all trouble and many different
[1:04:06] enemy spirits against us of ward and you
[1:04:08] know we've been tossed to and fro we've
[1:04:10] had trouble on every side but yet the
[1:04:11] Lord's brought us out of everything even
[1:04:13] if he's brought us out of that I mean
[1:04:15] we're going to go all the way in
[1:04:17] hallelujah Amen now there's a massive
[1:04:22] difference between those who now are
[1:04:24] probably just repeating myself but here
[1:04:26] we are there is a massive difference
[1:04:28] between those who walk with the Lord
[1:04:30] based upon theory and those who walk
[1:04:32] with Him upon experience there's a
[1:04:35] massive difference as I see it between
[1:04:37] those who preach from theory and those
[1:04:39] who preach from experience right debate
[1:04:42] just theory doesn't do it but experience
[1:04:44] as what what we really need when you
[1:04:47] know God has done something just like
[1:04:49] you sing you sing amazing grace before
[1:04:51] you know the Lord then you sing it after
[1:04:54] you know the Lord it's a very different
[1:04:55] song to you because it means the world
[1:04:57] homey you know that Amazing Grace how
[1:05:00] sweet the sound they saved the wretch
[1:05:02] like me know many people unfortunately
[1:05:05] if they just go on an intellectual
[1:05:08] Theory alone I mean many people fail and
[1:05:12] you know sadly but it's those who have
[1:05:16] an experience as what will really hold
[1:05:19] you because you know it's true but
[1:05:21] you've experienced it it's true it's
[1:05:23] just like you know I'm sure I've used
[1:05:24] this example before but you know there's
[1:05:26] a massive difference between learning
[1:05:29] just like someone who has never driven a
[1:05:31] car before but they know everything
[1:05:33] about a car they're literally a walking
[1:05:35] Wikipedia section on automobiles they
[1:05:39] know the history they know the
[1:05:40] development they know every brand that
[1:05:41] are exactly how all the electronics
[1:05:43] works how all the gears work how the how
[1:05:45] the engine works how everything works
[1:05:47] and even down to a specific model
[1:05:49] everything but there's a big difference
[1:05:52] between knowing everything about the car
[1:05:55] then when you finally get the keys in
[1:05:57] your hand you open the door you sit in
[1:05:59] the driver's seat you you put on your
[1:06:00] belt you know you put the key in the
[1:06:03] ignition
[1:06:03] you turn it on you feel the engine turn
[1:06:05] on for the first time you take the
[1:06:06] handbrake off going to gear and you
[1:06:08] begin to drive there's a vast big
[1:06:11] difference between the two knowing about
[1:06:13] it and experiencing it hallelujah so you
[1:06:16] know and it's the same thing you know
[1:06:18] you can ask that person beforehand what
[1:06:21] it's like to drive a car and if they're
[1:06:22] honest I'd say well I don't know but I
[1:06:24] hear it's like this and they can show
[1:06:27] you every all the details but they've
[1:06:29] never really done it but if they're
[1:06:31] honest they'll say well I've only heard
[1:06:32] it by seeking hand it's you're seeking
[1:06:35] hand I yeah I've never experienced it
[1:06:36] firsthand so you say well but what it's
[1:06:39] like to drive you say and that's how
[1:06:41] well I don't know well then you'd find
[1:06:42] someone who has driven right you'd find
[1:06:45] someone who's actually driven because
[1:06:46] then you can actually ask them to say
[1:06:47] well this is what happened to me when I
[1:06:49] drove it and it's the same thing when it
[1:06:53] comes to talking to people about the
[1:06:56] Lord who's never had the experience
[1:06:58] right people at you say you're people
[1:07:00] who say there's nothing about you know
[1:07:01] there's nothing to receiving the Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost or there's no really reality if
[1:07:05] God has just mental workup just a whole
[1:07:07] bunch of a mental illusion emotional
[1:07:09] workup it's all on the mind you know God
[1:07:11] doesn't really heal supernaturally well
[1:07:13] then the question really is to ask them
[1:07:15] have they experienced it you know
[1:07:18] because because if they say well no but
[1:07:20] I hear this well then you could say well
[1:07:21] hold on you never actually experienced
[1:07:23] this didn't you find someone who's
[1:07:24] really met him because they've
[1:07:26] experienced it says it goes beyond
[1:07:28] theory to a reality amen and then those
[1:07:31] are the people you really want to ask
[1:07:34] hallelujah now God allowed David to go
[1:07:37] through incredible things like the summe
[1:07:39] that the sums would be written so the
[1:07:43] whole purpose of of all the trials and
[1:07:46] in David's life is that the Psalms could
[1:07:49] be written so many times we think
[1:07:52] remember the Psalms weren't necessary
[1:07:53] just for David they were for us they're
[1:07:55] for the believers all through the ages
[1:07:57] so we can read them in the comfort of
[1:07:59] our lazy boys or whatever chair we may
[1:08:01] have you know air-conditioned house
[1:08:03] everything's just going fine and we can
[1:08:04] actually draw strength from someone
[1:08:07] else's hardship because God anointed
[1:08:10] that hardship God anointed that
[1:08:11] experience that these would be pinned
[1:08:13] down that we could draw strength from us
[1:08:14] I mean and it should be the same way
[1:08:16] with
[1:08:17] thing we go through I mean I mean that
[1:08:19] we that God would allow certain things
[1:08:21] to happen in our life that God were
[1:08:23] actually annoyed that experience that it
[1:08:25] could help someone else
[1:08:28] hallelujah you know it's amazing when
[1:08:31] when when David would would write in the
[1:08:34] psalm some 37 the steps of a good man
[1:08:36] are ordered by the Lord and he
[1:08:38] delighteth in his way
[1:08:39] though he fall he shall not be only cast
[1:08:42] down remember David knows what this is
[1:08:43] like for the lord upholdeth him with his
[1:08:46] hand I have been young and now I'm old
[1:08:49] yet have I not seen the righteous
[1:08:52] forsaken nor his seed begging bread so
[1:08:55] David could look back I don't know how
[1:08:57] what age we says I was young now I'm
[1:08:59] older so basically he's looking back on
[1:09:01] his life he says I've never seen the
[1:09:03] righteous forsaken and really it feels
[1:09:05] honest here you actually say I've never
[1:09:07] seen myself forsaken God was with me
[1:09:09] when I went down to the Philistine lands
[1:09:10] God was with me when when the enemy took
[1:09:12] all of our families you know Zig leg was
[1:09:14] taken God was with me when I was on the
[1:09:16] run from Seoul God was with me when
[1:09:18] epsilon rose up God was with me when all
[1:09:20] these things were going on the righteous
[1:09:22] have never been forsaken because he
[1:09:24] could actually say I've experienced it
[1:09:26] so he could God could inspire that and
[1:09:28] write it down hallelujah so that would
[1:09:30] mean a whole bunch more to him say I've
[1:09:32] never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:09:34] hallelujah because he's actually
[1:09:35] describing and he's talking about
[1:09:37] himself remember he had his ups and
[1:09:40] there's downs and it's also when when
[1:09:43] David would even write the words blesses
[1:09:45] the man whom God will not impute sin and
[1:09:48] I said David you take David sins you
[1:09:51] take Saul sins you think something's not
[1:09:53] quite right here David did far worse
[1:09:56] thinks then Saul but David new worlds
[1:09:59] like to be forgiven he knew what it's
[1:10:01] like to be found out sure but yours like
[1:10:04] to repent in you words like to be
[1:10:05] forgiven even under the blood of bulls
[1:10:07] and goats he found he found mercy
[1:10:10] hallelujah how much more now the Bride
[1:10:12] of Christ under the blood of Jesus
[1:10:13] Christ amen
[1:10:16] you know for example you know you know
[1:10:18] the Psalms you know you know we know a
[1:10:20] psalm is a song but many of prayers that
[1:10:23] are written down and and and those those
[1:10:28] prayers of David you know you're only
[1:10:29] pray something because you
[1:10:31] going through it you know you'd never
[1:10:33] pray for healing if you were well and
[1:10:36] you knew no one else you know why would
[1:10:39] I say for example brother Peter David
[1:10:40] you're perfectly well why would I pray
[1:10:42] pray on your behalf God heal Peter David
[1:10:44] he doesn't need it so I wouldn't pray
[1:10:46] for him in that way or even your own
[1:10:48] self I'm not if I'm healthy I'm gonna
[1:10:50] say Lord heal me I need healing no your
[1:10:52] prayers are based on your experience
[1:10:54] what you're what you're going through I
[1:10:57] mean so so David now I know that's very
[1:11:01] obvious but you know so you don't pray
[1:11:04] for things that you don't have need of
[1:11:07] now so
[1:11:10] so the reason we pray such praises cuz
[1:11:13] we're facing situations in life now
[1:11:16] David was inspired to to to pray a
[1:11:21] certain way because as enemies are after
[1:11:22] him now the Psalms as I seed so the
[1:11:28] Psalms were written many times in times
[1:11:31] of great trouble and anguish heartache
[1:11:33] worry I mean so really the pressures
[1:11:35] that they would found himself under
[1:11:37] cause the Psalms to be written they
[1:11:39] brought out what was really in David
[1:11:41] remember the Psalms actually Christ
[1:11:43] being manifested so all of our hardships
[1:11:46] and Charles and life is actually for the
[1:11:47] Lord to display himself in our lives
[1:11:49] that's the purpose amen so so all of his
[1:11:53] troubles all of us troubles just cause
[1:11:58] the Word of God to be manifested in his
[1:12:00] life remember when we read the Psalms
[1:12:01] we're not feeding on the mind of a man
[1:12:03] some now now I'm using brother barons
[1:12:05] language he says you're not feeding off
[1:12:06] the mind of a man you're feeding on the
[1:12:08] body word of the son of man just saying
[1:12:10] he not so so when we read the Psalms or
[1:12:11] when we read Paul's writings or or
[1:12:13] whoever the author is so for example the
[1:12:15] first five books of the Bible I'm not
[1:12:17] I'm not feeding off Moses's mind I'm not
[1:12:20] reading off his idea it's God inspiring
[1:12:24] him to pin things down as the same thing
[1:12:26] with the Psalms I'm not feeding off I'm
[1:12:27] not drawing comfort from from David's
[1:12:29] thinking even though he experienced many
[1:12:31] things and God used those experience to
[1:12:33] write it down we're feeding off the Word
[1:12:35] of God amen so so we're not feeding off
[1:12:38] the mind of a man but we're feeding off
[1:12:41] the Word of God when we are when we're
[1:12:43] reading the Psalms or
[1:12:44] any part of the scripture now you say
[1:12:47] but I'm not a songwriter I'm not a song
[1:12:50] not all of us the songwriters not all of
[1:12:56] us as thing as I say big Amen right
[1:12:58] there
[1:12:58] if you want me to flatten a note yeah
[1:13:00] I'll do that pretty nice but you know so
[1:13:04] so what's so what I'm saying is we're
[1:13:07] not all going to become suddenly
[1:13:08] songwriters because now we've
[1:13:09] experienced things and God is going to
[1:13:11] use those right songs no but the Word of
[1:13:14] God will be manifested in our life it
[1:13:17] will flow out of us
[1:13:18] based on our experiences it'll be in
[1:13:21] different ways but you know it'll come
[1:13:23] out remember everything in life will
[1:13:25] either make us better or better and
[1:13:27] we're not here for ourselves so actually
[1:13:30] my testimony is not for me though it
[1:13:32] sure helps me because I can go back to
[1:13:33] their God you saved me I was lost and
[1:13:35] undone you found me sure it helps you
[1:13:36] give me stability because the God that
[1:13:38] found me there is the same God here
[1:13:39] today but it's not actually just for me
[1:13:42] it's all about testimonies are for
[1:13:43] others that's why we need one another
[1:13:45] right to to to help one another now our
[1:13:50] Lord Jesus was called the Rose of Sharon
[1:13:52] now the Rose of Sharon in order in order
[1:13:55] to make perfume out of it you take the
[1:13:57] pedals I think it is and you crush them
[1:13:59] to get the fragrance out we take power
[1:14:02] of the flower you got to crush it so so
[1:14:04] what is contained in the flower can only
[1:14:06] come and be expressed when it's crushed
[1:14:08] and it's the same thing that happens in
[1:14:13] our life what is in us will come out
[1:14:16] based on the pressure and it will either
[1:14:18] bring out a religious carnality remember
[1:14:21] there's many things in our hearts right
[1:14:23] I'd like that bring out bring out a
[1:14:25] carnality or it will bring out the life
[1:14:27] of God amen
[1:14:30] didn't hear a lot of big a means over
[1:14:32] the Xoom for that's fine you know you
[1:14:35] know at will
[1:14:41] out of our lives for the only way it can
[1:14:43] come out as if we give it to him you
[1:14:46] know it's like it's like a person who's
[1:14:48] who who's planted a garden or tried to
[1:14:51] plant a garden like I've tried you know
[1:14:53] you know you you you you get soil you
[1:14:56] know you put in what you think is there
[1:14:57] yep this is gonna be a spinach leaves or
[1:15:00] whatever it was then you find all this
[1:15:02] other stuff growing there after you
[1:15:03] water it you know when the conditions
[1:15:05] get right you find all the stuff that's
[1:15:06] hidden in the salt begins to grow
[1:15:08] now you don't beforehand this would be
[1:15:11] next level if you did but you know no
[1:15:13] one that I know gets all the soil puts
[1:15:16] it through a sieve and beforehand knows
[1:15:19] exactly what every Cedars and takes out
[1:15:21] all the weeds how do they get the weeds
[1:15:24] out they allow them to grow then they
[1:15:26] pull them out it's the same thing it's
[1:15:28] the same thing even now lives these
[1:15:30] things buried in us that God wants to
[1:15:32] take out and has you look he allows the
[1:15:35] water to come the Holy Spirit to come
[1:15:38] down things begin to grow membrillo and
[1:15:41] then and then if there's a weed like
[1:15:42] like pride or you know being arrogant or
[1:15:45] or unforgiving spirit or whatever it may
[1:15:47] be you can't you know you're detached or
[1:15:49] condescending whatever it may be some
[1:15:51] negative part of a character God allows
[1:15:54] those things that come forth that when
[1:15:56] you see it you're shocked I trust we all
[1:15:58] are you know we're shocked by I can't
[1:16:01] believe I just reacted that way you know
[1:16:03] you say Lord I take it out of my life
[1:16:05] I meant and when you really give it to
[1:16:08] him then he begins to pull it out
[1:16:10] hallelujah but then you find yourself
[1:16:12] overcoming as you're going along
[1:16:15] remember God doesn't allow trials for us
[1:16:17] to fail he doesn't set us up to fail he
[1:16:20] sets us up to overcome he wants to give
[1:16:23] us victory hallelujah remember we are
[1:16:28] already victorious member David David's
[1:16:30] fail is did not make him not King
[1:16:32] anymore
[1:16:33] Amy remember there's the sure mercies of
[1:16:36] David and we're living under the short
[1:16:37] mercies of David today right so his
[1:16:40] failures didn't get him kicked off the
[1:16:42] throne sure he Heat you're here to pay
[1:16:44] for those those sends all those things
[1:16:46] but didn't mean he wasn't a man after
[1:16:48] God's own heart he remember God knew he
[1:16:51] would fall with Bathsheba God knew he
[1:16:54] would do all
[1:16:55] God knew he had number the people even
[1:16:57] before he was a shepherd boy God knew he
[1:17:00] was king right God knew exactly what he
[1:17:03] would do in his life but God didn't
[1:17:05] change his opinion about him it's the
[1:17:07] same thing with us God knows what we're
[1:17:10] gonna do tomorrow God knows what we're
[1:17:12] thinking right now God knows what we're
[1:17:13] going to do next week all the way up to
[1:17:15] the body change God knows we're going to
[1:17:17] have great victory and God knows we're
[1:17:19] going to fall on our face right and God
[1:17:22] knows we're going to be trouble in our
[1:17:24] spirit say Lord why have I got this kind
[1:17:25] of personality God knows all those
[1:17:27] things but God doesn't change your mark
[1:17:29] change his mind he can't mimic God can't
[1:17:32] change his mind he made up his mind not
[1:17:34] like we do remember our minds change
[1:17:37] based on evidence right how am I intend
[1:17:41] you saw so initially I could say this is
[1:17:44] the best phone in the world but then I
[1:17:47] just go and Google I find out actually
[1:17:48] it's a few years old now it's not the
[1:17:50] best so my opinion of the phone would
[1:17:51] change right but if I was God I'd say no
[1:17:55] this is the best phone in the world and
[1:17:57] I can't change my mind and that's a very
[1:18:00] crude illustration to be known I mean so
[1:18:01] so just like us God doesn't say oh
[1:18:03] you're wonderful one day and say no I
[1:18:05] just can't work with you the next day
[1:18:07] God says no you're the apple of my eye I
[1:18:09] mean you're hidden under my wings you're
[1:18:11] part of me
[1:18:12] Amen you're you're you're my wife I love
[1:18:14] you I've given my life you I've I've
[1:18:16] redeemed you you're part of me you got
[1:18:18] to be up there in the wedding supper he
[1:18:20] already sees us there right he's just
[1:18:22] waiting for it to be fulfilled just like
[1:18:23] an artist and their mind they see
[1:18:25] someone who's who's a great painter I
[1:18:27] mean they see that I work in their mind
[1:18:29] you know and a great artist can actually
[1:18:31] transfer what they see to canvas most of
[1:18:35] us cannot this seems to be some kind of
[1:18:37] blockage that you can't transfer it
[1:18:39] exactly you know but a great artist can
[1:18:41] write just like God he sees in his mind
[1:18:44] us redeem ground the throne made in His
[1:18:46] image cast our crowns at his feet or
[1:18:48] whatever he's seeing member because he's
[1:18:49] outside of time but now in time it's
[1:18:52] being drawn in canvas right and it's and
[1:18:55] it's finally and I believe we're living
[1:18:57] in the day when he looks down at us and
[1:19:00] says I see myself so much in these
[1:19:02] people remember by the blood of Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ he does by the Holy Ghost he does
[1:19:06] and then he and then any
[1:19:08] Hill he looked down at his bride say I
[1:19:11] can't stand being separated from them
[1:19:13] any longer come up home my beloved arise
[1:19:17] my fair one come away with me hallelujah
[1:19:22] Amen so now the devil has only a tool in
[1:19:25] God's hand what understand this the
[1:19:28] devil is only a tool in God's hand
[1:19:30] I mean Isaiah would write in Isaiah 54
[1:19:34] and verse 14 and righteousness thou
[1:19:37] shall be established thou shall be far
[1:19:40] from oppression he's talking about me
[1:19:43] he's talking about you remember in
[1:19:45] righteousness we shall be established
[1:19:47] the righteousness of Christ himself we
[1:19:49] are established I mean thou shalt be far
[1:19:51] from oppression thou shall not fear and
[1:19:54] from terror for it shall not come near
[1:19:57] thee remember as like the scripture
[1:20:00] there be a time of trouble this world
[1:20:02] will not be free of trouble but will be
[1:20:03] free from trouble why because we're
[1:20:06] heading in the cleft of the rock amen
[1:20:09] behold they shall surely gather together
[1:20:12] but not by me
[1:20:13] whosoever shall gather together against
[1:20:15] thee shall fall for thy sake so the
[1:20:18] devil's are gathering all of hell's
[1:20:19] emptied upon the earth they're gathering
[1:20:21] but not by not by the Lord why but all
[1:20:23] those that come against thee they shall
[1:20:25] fall for thy sake amen that's why the
[1:20:28] devil comes against you
[1:20:29] you know David were right in Psalms 27
[1:20:31] he says when my enemies came up to you
[1:20:34] know came against me to eat up my flesh
[1:20:35] they stumbled and fell once upon a time
[1:20:37] the devil come against us and we
[1:20:39] stumbled and fell but then now anew
[1:20:41] you're the strong man of the house came
[1:20:43] in Christ Himself came in and then when
[1:20:45] the devil comes against you and he
[1:20:47] thinks well I'm just going to defeat you
[1:20:48] like it at the other time no the tide
[1:20:51] has turned and now he stumbles and falls
[1:20:53] at your feet I mean just like Shem gay
[1:20:55] man he was there and and and and harvest
[1:20:58] after harvest the enemy would come and
[1:21:00] and they would take the crop and they
[1:21:01] would take you know you're taking all
[1:21:03] the way and basically his family would
[1:21:04] be left starving but one season when
[1:21:08] Shamgar brother bran would dramatize it
[1:21:10] he says he looked into the eyes of his
[1:21:11] children he looked into the eyes of his
[1:21:13] wife and he saw their condition and he
[1:21:15] began to hear the Philistines
[1:21:17] marching up the road to - to get his
[1:21:19] harvest and something awoke in
[1:21:22] he realized that he was the son of
[1:21:23] Abraham I mean he recognized here's a
[1:21:26] circumcised son of Abraham and brother
[1:21:29] and says that was enough right and he
[1:21:31] took his ox God jumped out the window
[1:21:33] through the door and he killed six
[1:21:36] hundred Philistines because he
[1:21:37] recognized who he was
[1:21:40] remember the Ox God didn't make him an
[1:21:42] overcomer Eliot nothing made him an
[1:21:45] overcomer just the realization of who he
[1:21:48] already was and it's the same thing in
[1:21:50] this our friends the Bride of Christ I'm
[1:21:52] looking at you on the internet here and
[1:21:54] I believe we were working to realize who
[1:21:57] we are I mean that is that it is not our
[1:21:59] lot in life that the devil comes and
[1:22:01] takes what he wants goes out that's not
[1:22:03] our lot in life a lot in life as the
[1:22:05] devil comes in any false hallelujah and
[1:22:08] and he is defeated Amen so that's why we
[1:22:11] should never remember when God is saying
[1:22:13] when God is looking for a people after
[1:22:15] his own heart we've got to recognize we
[1:22:17] do not become that we already are that
[1:22:19] David already was a man after God's own
[1:22:21] heart I mean he didn't become that by
[1:22:24] evening the anointing coming on his head
[1:22:26] he already was that hallelujah but the
[1:22:29] anointing just to work and what he what
[1:22:31] he was meant to be I mean that's the
[1:22:33] same thing with you and I remember we
[1:22:35] are the bride is the people after God's
[1:22:37] own heart irrespective of our failures
[1:22:39] and our humanity just like David Mamet
[1:22:42] David mimicked God didn't say he's a
[1:22:44] perfect you know he's a man after my own
[1:22:47] heart then you see David never puts a
[1:22:48] foot wrong never does nothing bad and
[1:22:52] and we try and put ourselves up in that
[1:22:54] kind of category and then we fall and we
[1:22:57] wonder why this because God saying
[1:22:59] actually you're putting yourself with it
[1:23:00] you're still human I know you still have
[1:23:02] human weakness you're still in these
[1:23:03] bodies that's why I think the greatest
[1:23:05] shout that's ever going to ring in this
[1:23:07] world is going to be when these bodies
[1:23:08] are changed father lujah that's going to
[1:23:10] be the greatest thing and the older we
[1:23:12] get the more we want them change not
[1:23:14] just because of all they just sitting in
[1:23:15] because you realize you know you realize
[1:23:18] your own failures in your own
[1:23:19] limitations the only things that
[1:23:21] frustrate you more and more you know but
[1:23:23] hallelujah it's gonna be the greatest
[1:23:24] shout it's going to be the greatest shot
[1:23:26] that's going to ring hallelujah amen
[1:23:32] now where have I gone oh yes we're still
[1:23:36] in the Isaiah 54 behold I have created
[1:23:41] the Smith to blot the calls in the fire
[1:23:43] and that bringeth forth an instrument
[1:23:46] for his work and I have created the
[1:23:48] wasted to destroy so God saying I made
[1:23:51] the waster to destroy but then the next
[1:23:54] verse is saying no weapon formed against
[1:23:57] thee shall prosper so God is saying I'll
[1:23:59] form someone I've created the war you
[1:24:02] know when you create something you form
[1:24:03] it right she's saying I have created the
[1:24:05] wasted to destroy he could actually say
[1:24:06] I have formed the the wasted to destroy
[1:24:09] but there no weapon formed against thee
[1:24:11] shall prosper so the devil that's formed
[1:24:13] against he he's not going to prosper man
[1:24:15] but all he does is actually bring out
[1:24:17] the Lord in your life you know the devil
[1:24:20] did the greatest favor to God in the
[1:24:22] Garden of Eden mimic God knew that there
[1:24:24] be a fall right but but before the fall
[1:24:26] you know remember God he has all these
[1:24:29] attributes he's a redeemer he's a savior
[1:24:31] he's a guide he's a husband he's a
[1:24:33] comforter you know he's a shepherd he's
[1:24:35] a high priest he's a sacrifice you know
[1:24:37] he's an atonement he's a peacemaker he's
[1:24:39] an advocate he's all these incredible
[1:24:41] things Adam and Eve didn't know him as
[1:24:43] that they knew him as father as creator
[1:24:47] I don't know as God that's it so so God
[1:24:52] was actually limited was limited he
[1:24:54] couldn't express maybe God God made us
[1:24:57] because he wants to express himself
[1:24:58] wants to reveal himself he wants a
[1:25:00] people that's drawn close to him he can
[1:25:02] walk with in life and reveal this
[1:25:03] character show who he is to them
[1:25:05] individually to us that's what he wants
[1:25:06] to do but he couldn't do that in
[1:25:08] fullness with Adam and Eve in the garden
[1:25:10] he couldn't do it he couldn't he concur
[1:25:13] them so Adam I'm your Redeemer
[1:25:14] I'd have never been lost Adam I'm your
[1:25:16] Savior I'd have never been lost
[1:25:18] uh I'm your healer Adam by by my stripes
[1:25:21] you're healed
[1:25:21] he'd never been sick hey I'm your
[1:25:24] comforter Adam he'd never need a
[1:25:26] comforting I'm your guide
[1:25:28] he'd never need a guiding you know all
[1:25:31] these all these things attributes I'm
[1:25:33] your advocate he never Adam never needed
[1:25:35] someone to work on his behalf you know
[1:25:37] we have the best legal team in the world
[1:25:39] in the universe hallelujah
[1:25:41] you know everyone it won a big court
[1:25:43] case they try to see the best lawyers
[1:25:44] they can get men
[1:25:46] our judge became our attorney the case
[1:25:48] got thrown out hallelujah but we had the
[1:25:50] best legal team in the whole universe
[1:25:52] hallelujah
[1:25:53] I mean so so God had all these
[1:25:55] attributes and our bottle of he couldn't
[1:25:57] express them but now the devil comes
[1:26:00] along and thinks he's pulling one over
[1:26:01] God know all all the devil did was
[1:26:03] actually unleash God upon humanity
[1:26:06] hallelujah
[1:26:08] you know remember he wasn't a Savior but
[1:26:11] then he became a savior
[1:26:12] imagine Megan stano's Adam and Eve
[1:26:15] you've never been scared before but now
[1:26:17] you're scared you're now standing in the
[1:26:19] presence of the one you loved and now
[1:26:21] you're afraid to be in his presence but
[1:26:24] then he gives a promise of the seed of
[1:26:25] the woman and he not he see basically a
[1:26:28] man's gonna come and undo all this he's
[1:26:32] gonna crush the head of the seed of the
[1:26:34] serpent and he doesn't only just give
[1:26:37] him a promise he takes some lambskins
[1:26:39] wraps his children and these lambskins
[1:26:42] as a as a as a token or an evidence and
[1:26:45] he has to take them out of the garden
[1:26:47] but imagine that you're a condemned he
[1:26:50] says no no this is going to be undone
[1:26:52] and then when they may be built their
[1:26:54] first altar when they walked out of Eden
[1:26:56] they could say Lord your arrow you're
[1:26:58] our Savior you're our sin offering
[1:27:01] you're our lamb they could never do that
[1:27:04] before but now they could do it and
[1:27:06] that's why I say we're the most
[1:27:07] privileged people in all the world the
[1:27:09] world is so dark but it's so light never
[1:27:12] has the people needed guiding like we do
[1:27:14] never has the people needed comfort from
[1:27:16] the Lord as we do in this hour even when
[1:27:19] the Prophet would would would look and
[1:27:21] he would say well I can't he says he
[1:27:23] just predicted he didn't prophesy cease
[1:27:25] I just predict everything's be done by
[1:27:26] 1977 he couldn't see past and I was so
[1:27:29] dark but then even in this darkness wish
[1:27:31] still walking in this darkness but he'd
[1:27:34] say no don't matter how dark it gets
[1:27:36] children there's light oh it's just so
[1:27:38] even and that when the Prophet couldn't
[1:27:40] see where we're living in 2020 I mean
[1:27:42] got us to walk with his children in this
[1:27:44] great darkness he says gross darkness
[1:27:46] would cover the people I mean but the
[1:27:48] glory the lord has risen upon me I mean
[1:27:51] so never before as the people needed
[1:27:52] light like we need it
[1:27:53] never before if we needed an advocate
[1:27:55] like we need it never ever people needed
[1:27:58] a blood
[1:27:58] like we need it or a guide or a
[1:28:01] comforter I mean there's so much trouble
[1:28:02] on every hand but yet we can stand in
[1:28:04] perfect peace saying my gods gutless I
[1:28:07] mean the Lord teaches us godless he's
[1:28:09] got our lives he's in control I mean we
[1:28:11] don't need to worry what we may face God
[1:28:13] says I've got this hallelujah I mean so
[1:28:17] you know and that's why I'm sorry
[1:28:18] thankful Lord I can walk with you you're
[1:28:19] my guide you're my comfort I mean you're
[1:28:21] my peace I mean you're my joy you're my
[1:28:24] satisfying portion I mean you're my
[1:28:26] blood you're my high priests you're my
[1:28:27] advocate you're my all and all God
[1:28:29] hallelujah Lord Jesus isn't that
[1:28:32] wonderful babies I'm so thankful that
[1:28:34] we're walking now as opposed member
[1:28:37] we're going back to before the garden
[1:28:38] because God is making us in a way that
[1:28:40] we can never fall he's putting us some
[1:28:43] bodies that we can never fall so we're
[1:28:44] going back before even before Adam and
[1:28:45] Eve were in that condition we're going
[1:28:47] to a better one hallelujah amen now
[1:28:55] hallelujah so no weapon that is formed
[1:28:57] against you shall prosper
[1:28:59] no devil will prosper and every tongue
[1:29:03] that shall rise against the in judgment
[1:29:04] thou shall condemn remember the devil
[1:29:06] comes against you tries to condemn you
[1:29:08] so hold on hold on hold on you know you
[1:29:12] gotta actually you know winning you know
[1:29:16] when he gets the talking stick he just
[1:29:17] goes you know tell her shut up shut up
[1:29:20] devil hold on and God's court of law I'm
[1:29:23] righteous I'm righteous remember someone
[1:29:28] is going to have to give an account you
[1:29:31] know the great white throne judgment is
[1:29:32] just going to be like the Garden of Eden
[1:29:34] judgment there but on a massive scale
[1:29:36] and it'll there's just my thinking it
[1:29:39] will just boil down who did this because
[1:29:42] wind from Adam to Eve to the serpent so
[1:29:45] it's going to go to who did this in a
[1:29:47] boil down ball down ball down and
[1:29:49] where's all the Sun going to go it's
[1:29:51] going to land up on one person his
[1:29:54] name's Lucifer and there's no wriggle
[1:29:56] room for him and he will actually pay
[1:30:00] for the sins that that that were should
[1:30:02] have been attributed to us brother
[1:30:05] Brahim says that the blood actually
[1:30:06] transfers the sin on to him onto the
[1:30:09] head of the accuser so the head
[1:30:12] now elsens that we're a lot of twists
[1:30:13] but by the blood Jesus Christ we will
[1:30:15] wipe clean now there on the head of the
[1:30:17] accuser and now he will have to give an
[1:30:19] account I mean for every single thing
[1:30:22] that's happened in this world he will
[1:30:24] have to give an account and he can't
[1:30:26] pass the buck actually not it's just
[1:30:28] urine on him
[1:30:29] I mean so what a blood render so now so
[1:30:31] now every ton that shall rise against
[1:30:33] you in judgment thou shalt condemn you
[1:30:36] say Satan hell was created for the - you
[1:30:38] and your angels that was created for you
[1:30:42] the new heaven and new earth was created
[1:30:44] for the Bride of Christ that's for me
[1:30:46] Amen so you have your allotted place
[1:30:49] that you're going and I don't know how
[1:30:52] long you'll be in there I'm not worried
[1:30:53] but you will cease to be there will be a
[1:30:55] time where the devil will never be even
[1:30:57] I don't even think of memory even even
[1:31:00] you take in the scripture the you know
[1:31:02] in the Old Testament about the scapegoat
[1:31:04] you know how one goat was killed I
[1:31:06] believe it is that they took the blood
[1:31:07] they put it on the other or something or
[1:31:10] they put all the sins on the other goat
[1:31:12] and they lean it out into the wilderness
[1:31:13] and it was just released and that was
[1:31:17] like the sin was now put sin of the
[1:31:19] people was put on that goat and it was
[1:31:20] taken out into the wilderness now that
[1:31:22] that scapegoat is not the devil because
[1:31:25] there because if it was then the devil
[1:31:27] would have part in our Redemption he got
[1:31:30] no part remember our Lord Jesus was our
[1:31:34] scapegoat
[1:31:34] he died on Calvary with our sin upon him
[1:31:38] right and he was taken he was actually
[1:31:40] put into you could say into a wilderness
[1:31:41] he took our sins down into hell on our
[1:31:45] behalf
[1:31:45] you take you take a you know you know in
[1:31:49] the in the Middle East in your Eastern
[1:31:50] countries they don't ship it like we do
[1:31:53] we you know we ship it cheap with dogs
[1:31:55] and whistles and you know you know
[1:31:57] that's how we herd sheep but they're
[1:31:59] they call them by name they know them
[1:32:01] right so in order for a scapegoat to be
[1:32:04] led down to wilderness and then and then
[1:32:06] the and then the you know the person
[1:32:08] actually get away from that goat the
[1:32:10] leader of that God actually would have
[1:32:11] to hide their face from the scapegoat
[1:32:14] there's like the father he say hid his
[1:32:16] face from from the son see it was a
[1:32:20] scapegoat being led into the wilderness
[1:32:22] by someone who he couldn't even see who
[1:32:24] he was
[1:32:25] and there's just released and now he's
[1:32:28] in a place he's never been before
[1:32:29] and now all the hounds all the walls all
[1:32:32] the Predators now can get that goat and
[1:32:34] it's not on where it should be it's lost
[1:32:36] doesn't know where it is and then now
[1:32:38] all the Predators cos predators can come
[1:32:40] and rip that thing apart and it was the
[1:32:43] same thing for our our Lord Jesus he was
[1:32:45] despised he is rejected
[1:32:47] I think the scripture says we hid our
[1:32:48] faces from him right and and he was torn
[1:32:52] he was wounded he was mad more than any
[1:32:55] other man amen and he carried our sins
[1:32:58] far away just like the scapegoat carried
[1:33:01] the sins of the people away hallelujah
[1:33:05] so the scapegoat in the scripture is not
[1:33:07] the devil the scapegoat in scriptures is
[1:33:09] our Lord Jesus Christ because otherwise
[1:33:12] the devil would have a part of our
[1:33:13] atonement no he's just going to burn
[1:33:17] he's our enemy
[1:33:19] Amen so we won't even and and I said
[1:33:22] that because you'd say well won't we
[1:33:24] remember the devil cause he's our
[1:33:25] scapegoat no cuz he's not said to me he
[1:33:28] won't even be a memory but we shall
[1:33:32] still be hallelujah now I might just I
[1:33:41] might just think I've got too much here
[1:33:46] but to you know start a whole different
[1:33:48] thing but I just want to I want to just
[1:33:50] stay with leave with this thought and
[1:33:52] then maybe we'll pick this up another
[1:33:53] time but but when when Adam I mean sorry
[1:33:58] when when Elijah was sent to the widow
[1:34:01] woman to be fed remember she was she was
[1:34:05] a Gentile she was sent he was sent to
[1:34:09] her em and brother Brahim says now to be
[1:34:12] he says doesn't be certain of God he
[1:34:15] says now that this little woman must
[1:34:18] have been of this of the calibre of
[1:34:20] Elijah
[1:34:21] that's why Elijah was sent to her
[1:34:23] because usually your actions show what
[1:34:27] you are and again she had been chosen to
[1:34:31] entertain God's prophet remember she was
[1:34:33] a Gentile not a Jew and the land was
[1:34:35] burning up and no doubt that this little
[1:34:37] woman
[1:34:38] being of that caliber being of that
[1:34:40] believer type for we see that God would
[1:34:43] not have called to her if she hadn't
[1:34:46] been a worthy one to entertain God's
[1:34:48] prophet for he would never have sent his
[1:34:51] prophet to a house that was unworthy it
[1:34:53] was not his choosing it was God's
[1:34:55] choosing it wasn't her bidding him it
[1:34:58] was God bidding him he had been placed
[1:35:02] by a Brooke the Ravens were feeding him
[1:35:04] but it was God's command for something
[1:35:08] to take place and God sure and God
[1:35:11] surely went to a believer of the same
[1:35:14] nature of Elijah so the Prophet saying
[1:35:17] that the the widow woman was the same
[1:35:19] caliber as the Prophet and that's why
[1:35:23] the Prophet was was was looked after in
[1:35:25] her house now you could say she was of a
[1:35:29] like heart to the Prophet that's why the
[1:35:32] two came together and it's the same
[1:35:34] thing now with you and I and in our Lord
[1:35:37] Jesus right why is this wise he came our
[1:35:40] way remember the message is not 1100 and
[1:35:42] tapes it's not a whole bunch of
[1:35:45] testimonies 1100 tapes and some doctrine
[1:35:47] that's the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:49] Christ revealed right as Jesus Christ
[1:35:51] made known it's it's a person right so
[1:35:53] now why why has this message came your
[1:35:56] way it's not because to make you feel
[1:35:58] little and useless and insignificant and
[1:36:01] you can never obtain or become know it
[1:36:03] came your way because God knew you are
[1:36:05] the same caliber as the Lord Jesus amen
[1:36:10] remember we need to look at ourselves as
[1:36:12] God looks at us remember we are not
[1:36:14] downtrodden just making it you know how
[1:36:18] we ever gonna get there know when God
[1:36:21] made us it's just like David Sammy was
[1:36:24] told go to Jesse's house I have a king
[1:36:26] among his sons he was already king when
[1:36:30] he was a shepherd boy he was king right
[1:36:33] he was anointed then he hid then he was
[1:36:35] on his way to the throne so I was then
[1:36:38] him came out because of the anointing
[1:36:39] because of the word that was spoken over
[1:36:41] right that's the same thing with that so
[1:36:43] he David was the caliber of a king he
[1:36:47] already was he had to walk into it sure
[1:36:50] and mature but he already was already in
[1:36:51] him and
[1:36:52] the same thing with you and I we think
[1:36:53] how can we ever you know you know we're
[1:36:56] such you know we you know we look at our
[1:36:57] humanity in our faults and our failures
[1:36:59] and we no question and we and we
[1:37:01] struggle in things but but we have to
[1:37:03] come to a conclusion now the reason this
[1:37:05] word came our way it's not for us to be
[1:37:08] poor downtrodden people thinking we'll
[1:37:11] never make it it's actually that God
[1:37:13] wants to show us no no no you are a
[1:37:16] people after my own heart
[1:37:18] you are the same caliber as me amen
[1:37:23] just like the widow woman was the same
[1:37:25] caliber as Elijah we are the same
[1:37:27] caliber as the word I think you know I
[1:37:31] hope this doesn't sound proud because
[1:37:33] it's not but you know we have to look
[1:37:35] because we always think Lord why did you
[1:37:37] call me why did you choose this guy when
[1:37:40] there was billions of other people who
[1:37:42] you should have and God said no no don't
[1:37:44] wrestle with it don't wrestle with it
[1:37:47] just have peace in your heart
[1:37:49] the reason this this Lord Jesus can't
[1:37:51] you just like how the woman the woman
[1:37:53] came into to to where Jesus was was with
[1:37:57] with with unwashed feet
[1:37:58] she was so stood up this is wrong head
[1:38:02] to dormer Service had to kiss her make
[1:38:04] him welcome had to anoint them if
[1:38:05] something moved in us moved moved in her
[1:38:08] heart this is how he should have been
[1:38:10] treated right because she their
[1:38:13] prostitute was the same caliber as the
[1:38:15] Messiah okay men think about it remember
[1:38:18] Simon the Pharisee wasn't the same
[1:38:20] caliber as the Lord he was of such a low
[1:38:24] caliber he tried to make him feel little
[1:38:26] by not make him welcome because he was
[1:38:28] intimidated by this man from Galilee but
[1:38:31] if he was the same caliber it's hey
[1:38:33] welcome Lord take the best seat let me
[1:38:34] let me wash your feet myself let me
[1:38:36] anoint you myself let me kiss your feet
[1:38:38] make you welcome myself what can I do
[1:38:40] for you I love you so much you're so
[1:38:41] worth I'm so thankful you had come to my
[1:38:43] house amen but she was the same caliber
[1:38:46] because what the service that should
[1:38:48] have been done to him she did hallelujah
[1:38:52] it's the same thing with us what's our
[1:38:54] hearts desire what's our hearts desire
[1:38:56] that's not you know our has his eyes
[1:38:58] Lord I want to see you live you're so
[1:39:00] worthy you're so wonderful not that I
[1:39:02] would try and earn anything but because
[1:39:04] you're so good to me you purchase my
[1:39:06] salvation your son loving you're so kind
[1:39:08] you're so gracious hallelujah that you
[1:39:11] would call us you would redeem us you
[1:39:13] would wash us in your own blood isn't
[1:39:16] that our heart and so and so we like
[1:39:18] that woman Lord when I want to break my
[1:39:20] other best the box at your feet I want
[1:39:21] to anoint you want to make you feel
[1:39:23] welcome what but why is it in our hearts
[1:39:25] you know we don't want to sin because
[1:39:30] we'll get caught we don't want to sin
[1:39:32] because we don't want to we don't want
[1:39:33] to hurt him
[1:39:34] hey we don't want to hurt the Lord Jesus
[1:39:36] that's why we want to that's why the
[1:39:38] believers something in their heart they
[1:39:39] even get a bit tense about am i pleasing
[1:39:41] him am i walking right am i doing your
[1:39:43] because they they don't want to hurt him
[1:39:45] in any way because of love not out of
[1:39:47] fear because of love and the reason we
[1:39:51] are that way is because we are the same
[1:39:54] caliber as him because we want him to
[1:39:56] have the highest place in our lives we
[1:39:58] want him to have the highest place in
[1:40:00] our hearts right not our own ego not our
[1:40:03] own pride not our own ambition not our
[1:40:05] own choices not not our own selves we
[1:40:08] don't want that to be ruling we want him
[1:40:10] to rule that's all we want and the
[1:40:16] reason we want that it's because he has
[1:40:19] made us the same caliber as him because
[1:40:23] remember God's wife is not a
[1:40:26] second-class citizen in his house she is
[1:40:29] not on the outside and some and some
[1:40:31] little stable somewhere when when he's
[1:40:33] in the palace and and when I choose I'll
[1:40:36] come see your woman and you better to
[1:40:37] know you better have all this and no no
[1:40:39] that's not how he is with us yeah I want
[1:40:41] you by my side as I see it I think
[1:40:44] couple of summers ago Moses was told by
[1:40:46] God there's a place by me come and stand
[1:40:48] upon the rock there's a place by me as
[1:40:50] my glory goes past it's the same thing
[1:40:53] wide lead on Calvary there's a place by
[1:40:55] him he said he sees in Isaiah heaven as
[1:40:58] my throne
[1:40:59] earth is my footstool but where is the
[1:41:00] place of my rest in other words did I
[1:41:02] made the galaxies I made the nebulas on
[1:41:04] a yo-yo I made all these things just
[1:41:07] with my word I made this entire
[1:41:08] everything that's creator I made it I
[1:41:10] made heaven it's my throne I made the
[1:41:12] earth
[1:41:13] that's my footstool but where's the
[1:41:14] place of my rest and they should be
[1:41:16] selling at us saying Lord can make you
[1:41:19] both
[1:41:20] the human soul is the place of God's
[1:41:21] rest should be in us Lord come come rest
[1:41:25] a while not just for a day stay forever
[1:41:27] Lord stay in my heart forever I don't
[1:41:29] want to push you out by anything of my
[1:41:31] humanity anything that would be a no
[1:41:33] Lord
[1:41:34] just may have you arrested here
[1:41:36] hallelujah
[1:41:38] and why does he come your way just like
[1:41:40] the widow woman and Elijah because she's
[1:41:43] the same caliber as him amen let's just
[1:41:47] I'm just gonna leave it there but
[1:41:48] otherwise we'll go and tie something
[1:41:50] else but give me a heart like dying Lord
[1:41:54] give me a heart like dying none of my
[1:41:58] ambition none of my choices remember a
[1:42:01] sheep gives up its rights doesn't take
[1:42:04] it back this is how we should be he
[1:42:08] trying to earn something no cuz I love
[1:42:09] him he laid his life down for me and it
[1:42:12] wasn't even just like yo no debt that's
[1:42:15] nice but it wasn't just like a lethal
[1:42:16] injection or saying no it was the most
[1:42:18] horrible death you can imagine and it
[1:42:22] was actually more the center on his
[1:42:23] shoulders that was the gruesome thing
[1:42:25] but he laid his life down for me
[1:42:28] shouldn't we should we allow our lives
[1:42:30] down for him he would say in John and
[1:42:33] and I won't try and find it but by
[1:42:35] things in John 14:15 you know and there
[1:42:37] somewhere he says I have sanctified
[1:42:39] myself for their sake so so say he said
[1:42:44] he you know he lived a certain life not
[1:42:46] for himself but for you and for I first
[1:42:49] disciples shouldn't we live a life for
[1:42:52] our family shouldn't we live a life for
[1:42:54] our siblings for four brothers and
[1:42:56] sisters for our even our work colleagues
[1:42:59] friends shall we live such a life that
[1:43:01] the that they'll want what we have you
[1:43:06] know even if they say oh those people
[1:43:07] are friendly people why are they
[1:43:08] friendly you know what's what's
[1:43:10] different about them you know shouldn't
[1:43:12] we live a salty life that people want
[1:43:15] what we have not just a wall you better
[1:43:17] turn or burn your ternal you're gonna
[1:43:18] burn or whatever you know there should
[1:43:20] be something in us that draws people to
[1:43:22] the Lord
[1:43:22] shouldn't we be in that way I mean let's
[1:43:27] um let's dance shall we and you want to
[1:43:30] come musicians actually and then we'll
[1:43:32] then we'll pray over
[1:43:37] why'd you say all that for God wants to
[1:43:41] use your testimony to anoint it that you
[1:43:44] can help other people just like the
[1:43:46] Psalms just like any of Paul's writings
[1:43:48] he experienced it
[1:43:50] then he wrote about it God inspired his
[1:43:53] experience I mean it was and it's a
[1:43:55] blessing to multitudes she said why did
[1:43:57] I go through that God wants to use it
[1:43:59] for someone else
[1:44:00] amen we won't have a heart like the Lord
[1:44:04] let's just let's just pray shall we if
[1:44:08] you ever need just want to raise your
[1:44:09] hands I want to raise my hands Lord
[1:44:12] their God we want to be like David Lord
[1:44:17] that when you try our hearts Lord I'm
[1:44:19] sorry I didn't get back to that Lord the
[1:44:21] opening scripture but he said when you
[1:44:23] try out try my heart may you find
[1:44:25] nothing there
[1:44:26] Lord and that nothing is a as a failure
[1:44:29] that's so something that's not of you
[1:44:31] Lord I pray when you look down at us
[1:44:33] Lord you see our humanity and Lord and
[1:44:37] I'm so thankful that that that never
[1:44:39] never came into the equation log when
[1:44:41] you saved us Lord he saved us by
[1:44:43] election Lord you chose us before the
[1:44:45] foundation of the world but did God I
[1:44:47] pray that all of us Lord all those who
[1:44:49] may be listening now Lord may we come to
[1:44:52] you and say Lord search our hearts Lord
[1:44:55] if there's anything that's not of Lord
[1:44:58] anything not of you take it from us Lord
[1:45:00] Lord take all all pride Lord even a pity
[1:45:04] party Lord
[1:45:06] spirit or a gossip spirit or lot of
[1:45:09] pride and arrogance or or or
[1:45:12] unforgiveness stubbornness whatever it
[1:45:15] may be Lord thanks Lord Lord things can
[1:45:18] be appear so subtle but low when you put
[1:45:21] your finger on it Lord that's when
[1:45:24] things happen so Lord we just want to
[1:45:26] commit our lives into your hands Lord in
[1:45:29] this Lord this could be the last Sunday
[1:45:31] we have they'll be fine but Lord make
[1:45:34] our hearts like now in Lord Jesus take
[1:45:36] take all all things are not of you Lord
[1:45:40] just may you come with your Holy Ghost
[1:45:42] and put such a sweetness in our lives
[1:45:44] Lord that we just love everybody
[1:45:47] the matter what they have done to us or
[1:45:49] do or the treatise law I would just love
[1:45:51] everybody
[1:45:52] maybe not hold nothing against no one
[1:45:54] Lord man we just lay our past at your
[1:45:57] feet as well but you allowed us to live
[1:45:59] through certain things Lord many times
[1:46:02] great through great pain and hardship
[1:46:04] and sorrow and regret but Lord you
[1:46:07] allowed it
[1:46:08] Lord I pray you just use those things
[1:46:10] inspire them anoint them Lord that
[1:46:13] they'd be hop to someone else father may
[1:46:16] we never come across arrogant or proud
[1:46:18] or above anyone Lord you became the last
[1:46:21] of the low Lord to lift us up into
[1:46:24] heavenly places so Lord may we may we
[1:46:27] have a real humility in our lives
[1:46:29] help us to be understanding of one
[1:46:31] another help us to walk in one another's
[1:46:33] shoes O God and Father give us a heart
