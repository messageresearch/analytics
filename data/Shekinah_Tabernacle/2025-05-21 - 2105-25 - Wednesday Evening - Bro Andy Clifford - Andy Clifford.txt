Father we don't father have some religion or some churchianity Lord but we have the living unfailing reality of Jesus Christ. And tonight we want to acknowledge you and exalt you and praise with thanksgiving in our hearts Lord Jesus. We humble ourselves under your mighty hand and we know that you've got this. You've got us. Father you've got all of us Lord. We don't hold anything back father. We've got no plan B's. We've got no back ways out. We're all in hook, line, sinker, fisherman, man, and boat, Lord, and all the ocean, too, because that's your spirit, Lord. And we want all and we give all, Father, for your glory. So tonight, Lord, I just pray, Father, you would just prepare the atmosphere, Lord Jesus, that we may, Lord, just, Father, receive from you, Lord, tonight, Lord. Let your word go forth with anointing, with your divine love, Father. Lord, let your spirit move amongst us, Lord. I pray that there would be mighty deliverances. Father, I pray there'd be healings, restorations, new births, whatever is needed in the house. But Lord, there's a people in this house that have a need. And I know that they're right now. They're calling on your name. Lord, come to my pew. Come to where I'm at because I'm in need tonight. I need something from you, Lord. I'm not leaving here the way I came in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Because Lord, there's an urgency in this hour. We're in the late hour of the evening time. Lord, the 11th hour, the 59 minute, the 59 second. Lord, there's 1 second on your time left, Father, before we get raptured out of here. So Lord, I pray Lord that we would get in the spirit like John got in the spirit, Lord. And Father, it didn't matter if there was snakes all around him on a horrible island of Pamos. He got in the spirit and he got in the Lord's day, Father. And if he can do that on Patmos, how much can we do that tonight? How much can we do that in the house of the Lord? Where there's an atmosphere, where the music's gone forth, where the spirit is welcome. Father, we welcome you tonight. We humble ourselves under your mighty hand and ask that you'd speak to our hearts, Father. prepare the ground Lord Father for a powerful prayer meeting too in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh thank you musicians. Just really um appreciate to be in the house of the Lord and just uh yeah it's good to be here. You know this is home away from home now and far out looking at all your beautiful smiling faces and really would love to fellowship and I'm sure we'll get as much opportunity as we can. Amen. why we're here two weeks. So, praise God. And really thankful to Brother Ben for opening up the pullpit and letting us have a have a 20 minute session. Amen. And we'll be good tonight. Amen. I'll put the timer on right now. Hallelujah. So, we're we're just really thankful and really grateful. Amen. To the Lord and to everything that he does in our lives. Amen. Hallelujah. So, let me just put the stopwatch on. I did have it on before, but I don't. It somehow has decided to be 5 minutes, but I don't know if I can handle that. E. Oh my. Hallelujah. Man, this is a pretty nice speaker system. Far out. Certainly technological advancements. Amen. Who's glad for technological advancements? Amen. Hallelujah. If they're used in the right way. Amen. Hallelujah. We can be blessed by them. Amen. Hallelujah. So, uh, tonight, Amen. I'll just um I just want to speak a little subject um called um from Revelation 6 verse 5 and 6. And we'll turn there and then you can have your seats after we read the word. And uh you know it's um if I had time I would send you some uh give you some stories and background of things that's been going on and uh up there up north, but I'm sure we'll get to do that at some stage and talk in person. So yeah, praise the Lord. But God is good and he's doing things and we're going home soon. Amen. And so he's finding those last souls. And they might be in a very hard place to find, but we'll find them by his grace. Amen. Hallelujah. Aren't you so glad that we have a captain that can get into the darkest places, the deepest dungeons, the furthest place. And David said, "Even if I made my bed in hell, behold, you're there." Amen. He can come anywhere. Amen. He's not afraid to get his hands dirty. He got them bloody. He got them scarred up, calloused over. Amen. He's got your name written on there. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. He God cares. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay. I want to speak on uh the subject hurt not the oil and the wine. Amen. And so let's just read from Revelation 6:5. And it says, "And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, come and see. And I beheld and lower a black horse. And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see that you hurt not the oil and the wine." Amen. You may be seated. Hallelujah. I'm so glad that he said that. Aren't you glad that the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of any sort of chaos or pressure that would come on uh these people in this age here and you know that these things still happening today. But I'm so glad that over all of the things that happened in this time for these people, the Lord said to the devil, "Hurt not the oil and the wine." Amen. And so that's going to be our subject tonight. And you know, I just want to speak, you know, because we're in an hour where there is so much pressure. We're in an hour where there is just so much going on. There is so much stimulation. There is It's coming at us from every angle. It's coming at us through every screen. It's coming at us from every billboard, through every mall, through every shop, through every It's a drive. There's a drive for our intention. There's a drive for our affections. There's a drive and it's pulling us. And it's pulling our youth. It's pulling our children. It's pulling the adults. It's pulling everyone. It's looking. It's finding. It's It's designed around you. There's an algorithm for you. You know that. There's an algorithm for you. And there's probably a hundred of them. And they're aimed at you. And they're coming from every medium, every media, every angle. And they're wanting to help you in this world to do things for this world and to buy money and to spend in Satan's kingdom and to do all of that sort of stuff. But it ain't going to help you get up there. Amen. Hallelujah. It's not designed to get us up. It's not designed to build us up. It's designed to busy us. It's designed to pressure us. It's designed to distract us. It's designed to fill our minds with pressure. So much pressure. This is an hour of pressure. But let me tell you, God spoke a word. He said, "Hurt not the oil and the wine. Hurt not the oil. Hurt not my people getting the spirit." Amen. Hurt not my people getting in the spirit. Hurt not my people getting filled and refilled and refilled again. Amen. Hurt not that ability for my people to have my spirit. Hurt not the oil, the wine, and all these things that the Lord said. He gave a mandate on the devil. He said, "Devil, you can't touch my people's oil. You can't touch the oil of my people. You can't touch their baptism of the Holy Spirit. You can't touch their experiences in church. You can't touch their experiences when they're struggling because my oil is going to be poured out upon them. I'm going to pour it out over them so their cup is filled to overflowing that they can't even contain it. Amen. And do you know what the Holy Spirit is? When our prophet went over up into heaven and he came back, the Lord said, "The very Holy Spirit that you preach is perfect love. Divine love." And this is the hour of divine love. This is the hour where we're coming right up into that perfect love economy. That perfect love environment. An environment where we come into a higher economy where the pressure comes off. Where the fear disappears because perfect love casts out all fear. So there is a mandate upon the enemy that says hurt not my perfect love. Hurt not the perfect love of my people. Hurt not the environment. Hurt not the atmosphere of my people. So that they can be changed. They can grow. They can change. They can rejoice. They can have a They can have stimulation. Hallelujah. They can get in the spirit. Amen. Hallelujah. There's so many pressures. There's financial pressures. Amen. Oh boy, those ones are really tough at the moment. And we know that. We can feel that. We see it all over the country. Amen. So many pressures, especially in that economic realm. Amen. It drives us to have to work. It drives us to have to do so many things to try and make ends meet. has drives our families in many cases where both parents have to work. And so the children have to go and there's there's all these pressures that come on and then what do they do? They go and say, "Ah, you know what we'll do? We'll just crush it a little bit more and we'll make them suffer and we'll make them have to strive." And you know what? That pressure comes on. But God said, "Hurt not the oil and the wine. Even when there's pressure on, even when it's tough, even when you ain't got no money in the bank, even when you can't even buy food, hurt not the oil and the wine." There will still be a rejoicing. There will still be a people that have oil in their vessel. There will still be a bride that can see in the dark. Hallelujah. There will still be a bride that can rejoice and be filled and refilled. Amen. When our teenagers are struggling, there will still be oil for them. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When our children don't know what's going on at school, they come back confused. There's oil for them. Hallelujah. There's a refilling for the parents that are striving and struggling. A refilling tonight. Hallelujah. If you need a refilling tonight, claim it. Lay hold of it. This is your night for a refilling. Amen. This is for you. Hallelujah. Hurt not the oil and wine. That means the devil can't stop you getting a refilling tonight. There's a mandate on the word. There's a mandate on him. He can't stop you getting a refilling. He can't stop you catching on fire. And you know what Jesus said? The fan is in his hand. As John the Baptist said that the fan is in the hand of Jesus. What is he here to do? Fan that fire in your life. Hallelujah. So that you can rejoice no matter how much pressure comes on you. No matter you got no money in the bank, ban that fire. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hurt not the oil. Amen. Hurt not the oil. We'll get to the wine soon. Amen. I'll be good. I need drink. Praise God. Amen. Somebody's pulling. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody's pulling. Amen. There's financial pressure. so much pressure. There's social pressure, man. The hard one, you know, especially for the youth, especially for those that are finding who they are, looking for their identity. I tell you what, there's so many sources to try and tell us who we are. But let me tell you, there's one true source that you should look at, the word of God, the message of the hour. And those that believe it and are filled by the Holy Ghost that are an example, that's really truly, you know, this pressure of identity. There's your identity. Your identity is already locked up in Christ. It's locked up in heaven. It's already part of that eternal part of God. And when you receive the Holy Spirit, you receive your identity. Amen. You receive a part of yourself. You know, in John 14:20, it says that in that day. And I believe that that's this day. If there's any day that that's that day, it's this day. Amen. This is that which the prophet Joel spoke of this. Let me just clear to you right now. This is that. Hallelujah. I want you to say that. This is that. Amen. Say you say it with conviction. Amen. This is that which the prophet Joel spoke of. Amen. This is my true identity in this day. Amen. In the day, in that day, Jesus said when he was talking in John 14, he said, "You shall know that I am ever present in my father. You are also present in me." That's already good enough. That's already good enough. Hallelujah. Before we even say the next thing, that's already good enough. Do you know what he says? And I am in you. Hallelujah. Woo. Oh, that's some real unity right there. That's a real oneness of God right there. Hallelujah. That shows me who you are. And when you receive that, you find out who you are. You receive that part of you that you have been striving, hallelujah, to have. Hallelujah. So many especially coming up through because we cannot have an experience of mom and dad. We can't have the experience of grandma. We can't have the spirits of pastor. We, you know, that's their experience. We got to come through the same channels. We got to come through the same battles. We're going to cross the same Jordan. We're going to go through the same Red Sea. We're going to go through the same wilderness. But we get the same Jesus. We get the same captain in our land taking the battle. And he's fighting a battle. We're fighting a battle that he's already won. Hallelujah. What does it do? What is this? Hurt not the oil and the wine. Hurt not that oil. Hurt not that provision that I've given for my people to overcome. the social pressures, the identity pressures, the spiritual pressures. So many pressures, mental pressures. Far out. There's medicines to awake. There's medicines to go to sleep. There's medicines for everything. Image pressures. This image that's been raised up. That thing that people so desire. That thing that that that the world is chasing after. That image that's been raised up, you know, and that image of a teenager. that image of a of something that you've seen on that social media, something that you've seen on that platform and somebody that struck your attention and you liked it. You liked what they do, you enjoyed that and that image. And then what does that do? It puts a pressure on you. It puts a pressure in your life for you to try and become that. And you know what it is? It's a stimulation of your affection, something that you like. But take a pinch and go, Lord, is this you? Lord, where is this coming from? Who told me that, Lord? Because Eve got told something too, remember? That's right. And Eve was in a garden in Eden. She was in a perfect condition. And she still stopped. And she listened to that serpent. She listened to that narrative. She should have, you know, she should have really gone, "Hold on a minute. Who's talking to me?" Cuz even if that serpent's telling the truth, he's a liar. Even if he's telling something that seems resonating in my memory, true, he's a liar. He's a father of lies. And even if he's saying something that's true in your memory and that's been under the blood, he's a liar. He's a liar fully. So, it's always good to question who told you that? Who's who's saying that? Where does this come from? Hallelujah. Because if it doesn't build you up and build you and place you in your position in Christ and bring love in an environment of faith, then it's probably not the Lord. Amen. It's probably just some naughty old voice, some narrative, some image, something from YouTube, something from whatever other those platforms, man, I can't keep up with them. Oh my. Now, you see now this pressure that would come on through this black horse, you know, this black horse that came down in that age under that seal, you know, they really struggled. What did he do? He came to press the people down. He came to give them economic pressure. He came to give them religious pressure. They got pressure. They got pressure. They got pushed down until that church got so pressured they became an underground church. And that seed of that church went down in the ground and suffered and they weren't even allowed to read the L Bible. They weren't allowed to even say the Lord's Prayer in the native tongue. They had to say it in Latin. They had no idea what it was meaning. That's what the devil would do. That's what the devil desires to do for our people. That's what the devil desires to do for us to try and pressure us to try and push us down. But let me tell you, there's a mandate on him. Hurt not the oil. Hurt not the wine. Hallelujah. Hurt not my people, let them be filled. Let them be rejoicing. Let them have their free filling tonight. Hallelujah. Whatever pressure you're under today, you don't have to leave here under that pressure. You can be pressurized. Amen. You know, like a diver when he goes down and he goes into the ocean and he he has to equalize the pressure in his ears. Amen. Let me tell you what the Holy Ghost can do for you tonight. Let me tell you, he can reressurize you. He can equalize you. He can put you into balance. He can give you a balanced approach. He can allow you to wake up happy, go to sleep happy, dream happy. Oh boy, fellowship happy. You can just be happy all the time. We don't have to be miserable. We don't have to be down. We can be happy. We're meant to be happy. We're made to be happy. We're designed to be happy. And we were happy before the world began. And we'll be happy when it's finished. So, we might as well be happy now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Might as well just be happy. Hallelujah. And if there's anything shadowing that tonight, don't let it leave. You just you just cast that thing down and you say you that that devil, that that oppression, that pressure, that black horse weighing out the balances, maybe it's not financial. Maybe he's weighing out the balances of your hormones. weighing out the balances of your chemicals in your body, teenagers, older women, middle-aged women, should I say, with all of those changes in life, and it gets hard and the mind and the devil takes advantage of that identity crisis. Oh, let me tell you that even under that pressure of that black horse and he's weighing out the balances and the devil's trying to confuse, let me tell you, the Lord gives a mandate. Hurt not the oil. Be filled. Be equalized. Come into balance by the Holy Spirit. Come into balance because he's been told, "Hurt not the oil and the wine." Hallelujah. Amen. You know, I just highlighted this thing and I heard a voice, amen. Who's heard a voice in this hour? Who's heard a voice of the resurrection? Who's heard the voice, Amen, of the seventh angel? Who's heard the voice behind the voice of the seventh angel? And that voice brings life. That voice is life. That voice is the resurrection. Hallelujah. You heard a voice. John heard a voice. Have you placed yourself in John's shoes tonight. Have you placed yourself because this is your journey too. Well, you do have a that we have a dark age in our life. We go through those things in our life. We go through times where it's hard. But let me tell you, even when it's down and you're in the valley, that's your valley. It ain't the devil's valley. You don't have to give it to him. You don't have to bow down to his chariots. You don't have to bow down to his demons. You can own your valley and be fruitful in your valley by your river. Planted. Amen. Solid. Hallelujah. Balanced with nutrition. Spiritual nutrition. All day, all night. Planted deeply. Solid. I believe I'm looking at solid people right here. I believe I'm looking at timeested memorials. Amen. Because you know what I'm talking about. You know, hallelujah. But that doesn't mean that you don't get battles. That doesn't mean that you don't have struggles. We all do. We have our valleys. But those valleys are not made for you to be oppressed, depressed, down, and stay there. Those valleys are made for you to conquer. Don't we remember in the time of Joshua how Manise and Ephraim were complaining to Joshua that that they only had this there's this small area. And Joshua said, "Well, go take your bellies." Oh, we can't. The iron chariots are too many. They'll hurt us. They were afraid. They let fear. But let me tell you, there's no fear that cannot be cast out by perfect love right now. If you're afraid of something, let perfect love come. We're in a revival of perfect love. This is perfect love in our lives. This is what the capstone is. This is what Jesus is all about in this hour. It's to what? Cast out the fear, cast out the confusion, cast out the imbalances, bring balance, bring joy, bring freedom, liberty. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Woo. Hallelujah. Let me look at this timer. Oh, good. We got five minutes. Hallelujah. This word hurt is an interesting word. Hallelujah. Remember he said that hurt not. He's telling the devil something here. This is what he's saying. You cannot be unjust to my oil, to my bride. You cannot be that hurt means to be unjust. This is what this word means to to do wrong. You cannot do wrong to this oil. You cannot stop this. Amen. Morally or socially or physically hurt to injure. You cannot be an offender. Hallelujah. To my bride. She will have my oil. She will enter in. She will be refilled when she needs it. She will have fellowship. She will get delivered. Her children will get delivered. Her people will come back because we don't give up. We don't give up. Amen. And when we get down, we just get fired up. Amen. Because he's fire. He's a consuming fire. And he raises up a standard in your life to overcome every obstacle to overcome those chariots. Man is saying Ephraim they had to overcome something that Joshua said you are more than able to do it. You are more than able to conquer those chariots. And if you just look at your circumstances and you look and you see oh it's too hard they might hurt me. Just let the perfect love of God cast out the fear man say cast out the fear Ephraim and walk forward with the name of the Lord because my captain's going before you. And he says, "Hurt not the oil and the wine." Hallelujah. You cannot hurt this. This word hurt, it means a bodily injury. Amen. Maybe the body gets injured sometimes, but hurt not the oil and wine. There's healing in the house. Hallelujah. There's healing. There's restoration. There's perfect love. There's an answer to every challenge. Hallelujah. a bodily injury or a wound, mental or emotional distress or anguish or suffering. No matter what, that went real fast. No matter that's 18 minutes now. No matter what we're going through, no matter how hard the pressure is, no matter if we feel like we're in hell or we feel like we're on the mountain, we feel like we're ostracized or we feel like we've been unjustly treated. That doesn't matter. Hurt, not the oil. You, no matter where you're at right now, the oil can come straight into your life. Perfect love can come and change the situation. whatever the need is in your prayer request tonight in this prayer meeting. Hallelujah. There is nothing too hard for the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. This this this wine. Hallelujah. You know when you start drinking wine, you know it does something to you. Let's say naturally. You know, let's say that you decide that you want to drink some wine, which you shouldn't because you don't need to because you've already got spiritual wine. But let's say you did. Amen. If you did, you're going to change your thinking, going to change how you talk. You'll probably start dancing. Naturally, you'll probably start doing things that you don't normally do. That's right. You know that something that you don't normally do, you'll start speaking things that you probably shouldn't have said. Hallelujah. That were true. You started becoming honest. The real you starts coming out. The real you. And that's the you that the wine of God's Holy Spirit, the wine of revelation makes you become honest, makes you become transparent, makes you become a real true person to who you are. And who you are in church is who you are at school. Who you are at school is who you are at home. Why? Because you're drinking the wine and you just say it how it is. You're not afraid. You're not ashamed. You got some Dutch courage. Hallelujah. You know what Dutch courage is? It's when someone's had a few too many to drink and they just start saying anything. They feel invincible. But let me tell you, when you drink the wine, hallelujah, of revelation and you are stimulated by God's word. Hallelujah. And you've been established in the word and you don't have anything to be afraid of. You're not ashamed of who you are cuz you got healed. And the real you is the one that people love. The real you. The real you. Youth young people. The real you. Not ashamed. No secrets. Nothing. Just the real you. You can be the real you in front of your mommy and daddy. Hallelujah. You can be true. Hallelujah. And this is what it takes. Let's be honest. Let's be true to each other. Don't be afraid. Amen. Let perfect love come and cast out all fear. Let's have the musicians. This wine is very powerful. And this is what the Let me just read this as the musicians come and then we'll bring invite brother Ben and u can you sing that play that song this joy that I have. Just think the oil and wine is not governed by the world. It's not governed by the world. It's not governed by Rome. It's not governed by YouTube or governed by how many likes you get on your post. Governed by your Instagram feed. It ain't governed by any of that stuff. Hallelujah. It's it comes from God. It comes from the shikina of glory. It comes from the place where no man can touch. Hallelujah. And it comes through a door that no man can shut. Hallelujah. And Jesus says, "I've opened a door, especially for these young people here. I've opened a door for all. We've walked through that door." Amen. No man can shut it. And this oil that I give, this joy that I have, this faith that I have, this message that I have, this family that I have, the world didn't give it to me. And if the world didn't give it away, Hallelujah. The oil that I have, the world can't take it away. And even no matter where I'm at, no matter how hard I might have fail and fall on my face, hurt not the oil. I might be down so dry in a desert suffering inconceivably in the mind. We however hurt not the wine. Let that wine pour out. Amen. Because it's here for you. What is your expectation? Amen. Why do we come? Why do we gather? We gather for a reason. We gather to drink wine. We drink. We gather to get covenant oil. We gather for deliverance. We gather to bring our fire together to hear the word, to be stabilized, to be strengthened, to be changed. We never have to leave here the same. Is that right? Hallelujah. One more quote. I just want to read a quote here. And I thought it would be quite nice to read about the wine. Amen. Just as that music plays. Hallelujah. He says here then I Oh, man. I've been down there. Wine is a stimulation. Glory. I feel it right now. Stimulated with joy. Shouts. Amen. I heard some of those tonight. Amen. See, and when it does, it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man. Because when the revelation has been given of a truth of God and the true believer filled with oil, good. and and the re revelation is revealed. The stimulation becomes so great that he makes himself behave abnormally. Right? Glory. See, that's what's the matter with them now. Now, if you want scripture for this, just start reading Acts two. Amen. Where they are at, they had the promise they had been given to them. When all of the promise of the Holy Spirit was poured out on them, it was scripturally a vindicated. Hallelujah. What if they had said, "Oh, now wait. He told us to wait up here for our ministry. And after eight days, they said, "Well, I tell you boys," Mark said to Matthew, "I believe we already got it, fellows. Don't you think so? See, we already got it." Well, while we're waiting on our ministry now, we ought to be going out and preaching. Well, we let No, let's wait another day. Let's wait another day. That's good. That's some good counsel there. And I just skip down a bit and it says, "This is Peter now after a few more of those questions." And he says, "Then then I can see Simon cuz he had the keys." Amen. There's a key right there. Amen. Excuse the pun. You know, now wait a minute, boys. The scripture has got something to say about this. He never told us just how many days to wait. He said, "You stay here until Hallelujah. until Amen. You stay there until Joel's prophecy come to pass." Amen. Until Isaiah's prophecy is a vindicated here. What are they doing? They are looking back to the president. They're looking back to what God has done. They're looking back to the prophecies and they're taking that word and they're finding themselves in the vision of the word. This is the this is a very important thing. I want you to catch this. If you catch something, I want you've got to see yourself in the word. You've got to know who you are in the word. You've got to find where you at. Where is your situation? Because let me tell you, there's many places where your situation is already written. And it shows you the same God will do the same for you as he did for them. Amen. You got to anoint that word. Anoint that promise tonight for your people. Who you're praying for, brother Ben. Who you're praying for, whatever it is that you need, anoint that word. Find it in the scripture. God will show it to you. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother Ben. Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Let's um let's sing that song, shall we?
