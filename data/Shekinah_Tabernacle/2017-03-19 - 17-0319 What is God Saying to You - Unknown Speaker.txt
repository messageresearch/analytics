of addressing my family and on behalf of my pastor Ben gloin um I'd like to take the privilege to welcome Pastor ELR from taneki as our pastor is away this morning please have uh him in your thoughts and in your mind keep him in prayer as he out um strengthening our other Brethren around the country so this morning I just want to say Welcome to our brother ELR and his family and it's not about

come home all right whether I come to your home or you come to my home we are home so let's give the Lord a great uh clap offering as we welcome our brother [Applause] amen amen good morning brothers and sisters it's a wonderful privilege to be here and just a privilege to serve the same daddy amen same father we know that I mean when when he is uh when he's present amen that we can just relax in his presence and mean also promis that we two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in your midst amen so we come this morning with a promise but I believe also we come with a personal experience that Christ is inside this thing amen that was as we come here together that we bring all those licks of fire together that we will just have a wonderful blessed time in his presence I mean I'm just really thankful for what the Lord has done for us over the last week or so with brother Nest being down I trust you've all enjoyed Friday night and it's been a real wonderful wonderful time and just you know just in Simplicity um I I just for me personally my testimony is that it just seems like the word is just getting simpler and simpler amen because it's no longer a mystery amen amen we don't we don't read the last book of the Bible the book of mysteries anymore it's now the Book of Revelation amen it's open H Allelujah as we've sung in a number of songs just really enjoyed that song service and I trust that we come with with Open Hearts this morning am mean I can't give you anything amen but if you if you touch him amen If You Touch the Hem of His Garment I believe supernaturally the Lord will will give each one something this morning if we come prayed up let's turn together thank you very much musicians let's turn together to the Book of Psalms Psalm 62 amen I would just like to acknowledge brother brother Ben he's a really good buddy and friend and just appreciate appreciate him very much and appreciate the trust that he's placed in me to to be able to take the service while he's not around would it be really yeah probably not going to work if it would have been okay I would have put my hat on this Eon is right on my Bal spot no worries I don't want you to sweat it out so if it's get if it gets too hot then yes that's better thank you very much my brother amen Psalm 62 and we'll start from verse one amen truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine Mischief against the man he shall be slain all of you as a bowing uh wall be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly sah my soul W thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Sila surely men of low degree are vanity and Men of high degree are van are a lie to be laid in the balance that are altogether lighter than vanity trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them God hath spoken once twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God also unto thee Oh Lord belth Mercy for thou render to every man according to his work am mean we'll just read that far let's speak to the Lord one more time precious and loving Lord Jesus oh God we can gather here we can go through all the Motions we can play Church father but that would not mean anything father Lord Jesus until you come and make the Supernatural Part alive Lord father and I pray this morning Lord that you will just take me completely out of the way father I just I pray that you will bless all these precious brothers and sisters Lord with your presence Lord I pray that you will use this vessel father to your glory Lord we want you to be lifted up father no man father that no man will be seen but Jesus only Lord father we love you and appreciate you so much Lord I pray that you will just come on the scene now and make this precious word so real father you see the need in every heart father Lord and I pray that you will just supernaturally Lord speak to those need needs Lord Jesus I also want to come this morning Lord and take every Spirit under my control for your glory Lord in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen you may be seated brothers and sisters now the title this morning is what is God saying to you and really the focus this morning is on that to you part amen because God is saying a whole lot of things am I mean but God is saying different things to different groups of people and what God is saying to you is determined by where you are at in election but there's a further part and that is your specific purpose your specific predestinated attribute am mean has a specific purpose that God God doesn't do things just willy-nilly I mean God doesn't do things just because he's bored I mean God doesn't do things just because he thinks oh might be a good idea amen hallelujah everything God does is for a predestinated purpose and because God has a has an intention he's got a goal in mind he's got a vision in mind of what he wants to achieve amen now there are so many voices in the world today Everywhere You Go voices voices voices amen and those voices enter us visually through our through our hearing through every everywhere we go everywhere we you know every direction we look I mean voices voices voices I mean there are just so many things everywhere you go sometimes it's just completely information overload I mean really in reality there's more out there than we can cope with that we can deal with naturally speaking and that's Satan's attack amen but there is a still Small Voice also I mean you can't turn anywhere telephone calls I mean there's terminology that a few years ago would be completely foreign I always chuckle if I think if we wake someone up that died 50 years ago even and we wake them up and we tell them all this stuff that now is Common Language amen they would think what planet are you from what language are you talking about amen I mean they would have known about telephone calls but today we have tweets and Instagrams and news flashes and voicemails and text messages emails Snapchats amen but then we have also the song when you walk into the McDonald's am mean that stuff comes into our senses am mean and we need that inner voice am mean to be stronger than those things we walk into the shopping mall we see the more than lifesized naked lady with underwear on standing in the middle of the road and a son of God will have to look away I mean because of that Life of Christ inside us I mean you're driving your car down the road down the highway and there's a huge billboard I mean you can't miss it if you want to and I mean you drive behind the car in front of you there's a bumper sticker on the back I mean the car driving past you has a custom number plate I mean and you what does that say oh yeah I get it I mean that kind of constantly constantly constantly we are bombarded amen the f Facebook messages that pop up now on people's cell phones when they walk around amen if someone is unhappy with service you know it's it's so common now people walk into a restaurant and they get bad service within 5 minutes the whole world world knows about it because it's already on Facebook just constantly information overload there's so many voices out there amen the mria of signage and Shop Windows when we walk down the road the Fashion's worn by people around us it's speaking a voice amen those things are all speaking to us the pile of junk mail that we get when we open our mailbox amen more voices more inputs and the opinions expressed by people around you when you go to work when you go to school when you walk down the road when you turn on the talk back radio when you turn on anything I mean voices voices opinions and I want to speak a little bit on some of these voices this morning I Meenan and every one of those voices my brothers and sisters can be a positive voice for you or a negative voice and sometimes a negative voice can come wrapped in a very positive package and sometimes and here's the scary part and now I'm kind of running completely ahead of myself but the scary part is that a a negative voice can be wrapped in the package of a blessed brother and sister of someone that's really close to you of someone that you look up to someone that you respect someone that that you open your heart to so easily sometimes those those people can also speak negative voices to you friends colleagues family I mean the thing most teenagers struggle struggle struggle struggle with is to be accepted in a group amen popular opinion opinion PR peer pressures and things I mean I think it was brother mana and then that shared with me recently they they uh and I might get it completely wrong but I'll just kind of give the gist of it um how people do tests and things and they put put people in in um in a room and and they would um they would give them choices and they they would choose between two choices two choices two choices and then the person who made them choose will take those away and scramble them and actually mix them up and come back and ask them why did you choose this one when in fact they chose that one so they didn't choose this one in the first place but people are so prideful I mean that they go and find a whole lot of reasons why they chose this one and it's a bunch of garbage they actually chose the other one I mean people are just like that am mean people want to be accepted am mean when the next person says something you don't want to be contrary amen because of group pressures and things the voice of popular opinion I mean yesterday Brother Andy and I after we dropped brother nesto at the airport came through town and lo and behold there's the gay and lesbian uh March downtown what a bunch of f i mean what a bunch of f but you know what 50 years ago probably when they would have walked down the road with the clothing on and the way that they did they would probably have been arrested the whole lot of them but now it's oh it's so wonderful they're expressing their opinion what a bunch of garbage I mean but popular opinion has changed brothers and sisters this is Satan's Eden I mean popular opinion is no longer the word of God po popular opinion is no longer guided I mean by moral principles or even to be blunt by logical thinking people have become absolutely crazy out there but you know why it happened because it didn't happen overnight Satan runs a marathon not a Sprint he'll just give a little bit of a time just slip it in just slip it in Sister Chantel um shared something that that happened at her work with a guy that's a a crossdresser am mean he didn't Rock up at work one day and you know had his fish nets and his lipstick and all his stuff on he just kind of wore a song for a little while and then when people stopped talking he introduced the next little thing and the next little thing and after a long time no one is saying anything negative it's just man he's so he's so he's got such courage to express how he feels I mean but if he walked in there on day one like that everyone would have like weirdo I mean but that's exactly what Satan does those voices just wear away on us amen the voice of the media there just so many voices so many things that work in on us from all sorts of different directions amen they are not impartial they are not inspired by God Amen they are inspired many times the voices that we hear around us that's so common to us amen are not inspired by God and some of it comes so innocently amen a little advertisement for something in your email in your inbox and then there's filth you know so many times I've said it in church so many times when I search for a few pictures for for the Powerpoints amen you type in seventh seal naked woman you type in you know God naked woman everything everything everything is infiltrated amen by Satan Hallelujah then there's the voice of message Believers around around us and like I said at the start some are positive amen but whether we like it or not some are not good for us some of those voices are balanced and god-given but some are not amen and and I just want to make sure that that I get this very clear from the start amen the person carrying the negative voice may be an elected seed it may be a son or daughter of God but it just may be someone that's struggling with insecurities it may be someone that is just not maturing their walk with God it may be someone that God is allowing that God is using actually to give you a test or a trial amen so the package is often a real son and daughter of God but unfortunately there's there's negative voices sometimes there's sometimes pressure there's sometimes support from our close friends for the wrong things when we actually take a little bit of a wrong road amen it's so much easier if your buddy says oh that's all right that's not so bad I mean it's the typical church youth where you know there's a standard in the church and then the one 15-year-old says hey I'm going to go to the bicco and then the friend who would never have considered that thinks well if he can go I can go along too amen and the next one is drawn in and the next one is drawn in and before you know everyone goes the standard is dropped amen then there's another voice that plays an amazingly huge role in these things now it's lovely I can preach these things easy because I although I know a lot of you at arms length I don't know what's happening day today so praise the Lord I know I can't be standing on any toes uh actively so we'll leave it with the Lord amen but one of the things that's often a challenge is our culture and our upbringing amen we look at everything around us through the lenses of our family way this is just how we do it this is how we think about things this is how our church does it this is how I think about it this is how you know my culture my this my that Amen brother Marcus Becker when we were in Indonesia last last November he said yes I hear there's many cultures and things but the holy spirit is only one culture amen that was a really good good principle am mean the Holy Ghost is sensitive to certain things and insensitive to other things the Holy Ghost is happy with certain things and unhappy with other things and no matter which culture you come from the Holy Ghost is not going to change his likes and dislikes based on your culture amen amen many many times you hear this is how mom taught me this is just how I do stuff amen I mean many of us can say today and this is not criticizing parents but I can say and and I'm sure many of you can say that some of the things mom taught me is not right amen some of the things mom taught me was because of her own insecurities sometimes just her immaturity sometimes just completely a wrong understanding it doesn't make her a bad person I mean she did absolutely the best she can but sometimes it was just wrong so the whole perspective of I'm a key I'm a African I'm an African I'm a this I'm a that whatever I mean actually my brothers and sisters I really really personally I try never to associate myself with an Africans culture because I want to be a Heavenly culture amen I'm to be blunt I'm ashamed to be a Africana and I know this will probably scratch some some you know headstrong africanos and I hope there's not no one like that here but but I'm ashamed when I read the the in the message how brother Brandon went to South Africa and we have those that real staun africanness you know pushed him in a direction that the Holy Spirit inspired him not to go amen but praise God I'm not Africana anymore I mean just like brother brandham says I'm not the son of Charles and Ella brandham I mean I've had a rebirth now I disassociate myself from my culture i disassociate myself from those things now of course there's a natural side you think about things in a certain way and so forth but what I'm saying is my brothers and sisters if the Holy Ghost takes over in my life if the rebirth has happened in your life I mean those things should be stronger than your culture than your anything else so we speaking of filters really amen how we look at life is often filtered through my culture my way my understanding how I was brought up and all those things and your culture can be a voice that's actually sometimes unfortunately overriding the voice of the holy spirit in your life then there's the voice of your pastor now brother Brandon makes a statement that he says your pastor will see you through he make statements like you can't live higher than your pastor now my brothers and sisters if it's ever in a pastor's heart to to hold that above people he's got a problem amen if the pastor bashes people on the head you can never rise higher than me bang amen that should never be in a pastor's heart but I you know knowing brother Ben I know that's not in his heart his heart is to lift everyone up his heart is to communicate the love of God his heart is I mean to submit to to put himself down like Jesus said when he when he washed the disciples feet am mean I didn't come to be ministered to I came to minister minister is a servant amen and I believe the pastor has to have a servant attitude my brothers and sisters but the reality is the prophet said he's the headship he he's the leader and God needs to lift him up in order to lift the church up I mean that's why just taking brother bam as an example that's why God had to take brother brandham off the scene so that we could come up to the same place that he was I mean otherwise that's that principle would still have remained we would always have been lower than the prophet amen but now when God pul put the prophet pull the prophet out of the way God raises us up amen so that we can have that individual walk with God but the pastor is just a man the pastor is going to make mistakes and that's why we have to pray for our ministers for our pastors we constantly we have to pray that God give them more Revelation am mean if you frustrated that and and I know this is not the case with with brother Ben so I can say it easily but if you're frustrated and saying man I wish brother Ben can have the same Revelation I have then pray for him amen calling him over and telling him you need to see this bu that's not going to help him amen all you're going to do is you're going to put a pressure on him amen and you're actually going to draw down his faith or pull down his faith amen what you do is you enter in on your knees and you pray for him and you ask God Amen and I want to ask the question do you really respect the office it's not the man it's the office am mean like I said the man has many mistakes if we look back at the time of of David now God was never a Democratic leader I mean brother Bram says God's way is a Godly King where God is in control of the king in fact when God has the king's heart then the Holy Spirit leads the king and the King leads the people and really if the king is genuinely completely surrendered to God it's not the king leading it's God leading through that King so when God was able to rule through David God was ruling Israel and as long as David was led by God Israel was the safest possible place to be even though they make mistakes and all those kind of things I mean they would be the safest place to be and I trust it would be okay to take that down to the local church when the pastor is led by God not led by pressures of what people put on him not led by other ministers around the country phoning up and saying you should do this and you should do that not by pressures by trying to match up with others not by trying to impress others nothing just being led by God Amen you'll be the safest church that you can be but like I said J David was just a man he made mistakes and when he made those mistakes Israel suffered with him but but my brothers and sisters there was not a single time that you read in the scriptures that God ever ever thought or uttered the words that I'm going to push you off the throne amen because David is the same one that writes in the Psalms God you know I'm but a man amen he knows his Frailty amen but God never considers pushing him off because of a mistake amen God says you'll suffer for it but God retains him there because God knows I've got his heart I mean brother Braham speaks about how he was quick to repent I mean and that shows when you're a Son of God when you're quick to repent and openly repent transparently repent and that's different than it was for Saul because Saul was never God's choice Saul was never The Godly King Saul was God's answer to what the people wanted it was what the people desired and God gave them what they desired and God showed them that's not what I wanted for you and God easily just wiped him off amen wiped him off of the throne I mean brother bam shows that he's still still going to be there amen and we know those things but in terms of the throne God easily pushed him aside because he was not The Godly King but you know what also happens and I know these some of these things can be sensitive but like I said praise the Lord I don't know your details so that's between you and the Lord I mean but in the time of David one of his sons Rose R up and Absalom and what did Absalom do amen he looked at how his daddy judged cases he looked at how his daddy advised people and he thought I can do better than that I think I can I can give a better word on that thing and he started saying out there if only I was King if only I was the pastor if only I was in in in in in control here then things have would have been different if only I if only I if only I how many abss do we have in the message today he had his own Ambitions maybe his own understanding perhaps his own perspective am mean perhaps he just completely different with how his dad handled things like I said sometimes I believe we have absalons in our church when God is using the minister when God is using using the pastor when God is using gifts in the church to deal with things sometimes the absolon because of the different understandings because of maybe the insecurities because of whatever reasons I mean they go in and actually work against what God is doing I mean sometimes God is saying take your hands off this gu so that I can deal with it and then abson would be de Oh Sister God loves you so much and actually maybe God is I mean God is actually dealing with with that person am mean and and now we can so easily say oh how do we get this right well easy but not so easy I mean easy the answer is easy and that is be led by the Holy Ghost amen be led by God Amen be led by what God leads you to do but genuinely make sure and this is the whole theme of today so I can kind of stop preaching now if you get this but when God genuinely put something on your heart not your own Zeal not your own idea not your own insecurity not press from others if God puts it on your heart then God will will work it all together then all the gifts in the church will go in exactly the same direction am mean then there's no pressures then there's no absalon's working against David's amen because then God is in control of all those gifts and then God is honoring or is honored and gets the glory from all those gifts am mean sometimes we have the voice of V visiting ministers and I'm kind of putting my myself in that box this morning I mean sometimes it's nice to hear the word just from a slightly different perspective you know sometimes for a pastor is it's like you know you preach something for months and months and months and then a visiting Minister comes and it preaches one service and a brother or sister comes to you brother did you hear that am me it's like well this what what I've been preaching for the last year but praise the Lord you got it amen hallelujah we have the voice of streaming and I know this is a sensitive subject amen The Challenge and there's a whole bunch of things and I'm not going to go into that in detail but that brother is dealing with something in the local church and God is actually sometimes the preaching when when a church is leaning that way God lets the ministry hang this way to pull them back to the middle and now maybe you are leaning this way and you streaming yeah brother amen preach it because he's amening me that's why I'm amening him back and actually maybe God wants to show you the other side of it amen there's sometimes things and and I know for some people this is really hard but I you know I'll give you a practical example um I preached something in in church and and something about um people studying and I spoke about how um in in where where we come from back in South Africa where um a generation ago how there was absolutely it was taboo to go study to do any tertiary studying at all and because brother Brandon makes the statements that you know the more you learn the further it takes you away from God and those things were pulled out of context and people 40 years later 50 years later they have they still have frustrations in their hearts that my brother-in-law for example he wanted to become a a teacher and his dad just refused because studying is of the devil there was an un unbalanced way and now I believe God is bringing that to the middle of the road and what I'm saying is studying per se for the right purposes the right um um you know if your motives are right and so forth is not it's not a bad thing per se obviously there's major issues with chucking your kids in a in a university Hostel at the other side of the world if they're not absolutely rooted and grounded and if if they haven't had the rebirth that is probably the worst place you can put them but the the point I was making is you know there's a there's a right balance to it there's nothing wrong per se with studying and then I traveled to another part of the country and had some fellowship with a brother and as we were sitting around a a coffee table in a in a little cafe the brother said praise the Lord our Minister that that ministered this week has blasted everyone for studying now I'm asking which of them is from God and I will happily say both because maybe in that church there was an unbalanced way around it and maybe they were you know completely overzealous on the making money and on on you know big incomes and comp competition and keeping up with the Joneses and all of that and maybe God was saying to them there's a balance to be gotten here so like I said if one of the people from from our assembly was streaming into that church amen they would have amen my pastor is talking garbage but actually it may be that God is telling you something but because you can now find someone else that agrees with your position it negates what God is actually trying to say to you I hope these things are okay brother Ben said I should take my Liberty amen so sometimes also some of the streaming ministers and we've seen a number of of very pertinent examples over the last years they start slowly going off the track slowly they slip in things that's not right and eventually they completely leave the message sometimes eventually they bring in completely false doctrines and things I mean every single false Doctrine among the message has started off with good intentions I mean and and I want to just say we need to be very very careful who we lean our ears down to am me who we allow to speak to us all those voices I refer to brother Bram strip to South Africa earlier he was there on God's command God pre-warned him amen that you're going to have a major trial when you get there he thought it was going to be some witch doctor was doing stuff or whatever amen but here he had clearcut indication the angel appeared to him and said go to deran amen the angel said spend two weeks in Johannesburg I think it was then go for a hunting trip to brother Sydney Jackson's farm for 10 days and then after that go to deran clearcut Angel gave him two specific signs and the Ministerial Association said no God told us otherwise we've set up this other routine and you have to go with it amen voices brother Bram stood in that place God's voice versus other people who actually said to him does God speak to only you and he said to them that's exactly what Kor said to Moses amen but still they wouldn't give him an inch and you know what God held him responsible God allowed his allowable his permissive amen but brother Adam suffered for it for months and months and months and months and months we read in the Bible that that sorry I hope I'm not creating too negative a picture here but I trust you'll see it come together later God willing we read in the Bible that story when jeroboam U made those two golden carves I think it was where where God sent that Prophet to prophesy against him and he prophesied and so forth and another Prophet came to him and said God said to me you must come to my home and he said God said to me I should go straight home no but God spoke to me too my brothers and sisters that's the most dangerous place to be in it's exactly where brother Brandon was there amen it's the most dangerous place to be until God doesn't tell me amen it doesn't help you saying God spoke to you it doesn't help you bringing signs and wonders God needs to tell me amen and eventually that Prophet listened to the other prophet and what happened was he was eaten by a lion the next day am mean and that other Prophet was sad and naturally speaking kindly thinking you think you could think well it's his fault no it's I believe God told him to do that because I believe God wanted to show us an example today God needs to tell you very clearly no matter what anyone else says and then there's a big one a big one that I think is probably the most pertinent one because of the greatest battle the voice of our own human spirit the voice of our own intellectual understanding the voice of how we see the word the voice of all our own hurts complexes emotional damage all those things the perspective at through which we judge things around us and often because we think something is right we believe it's God saying it and I'm sorry but not everything that comes in our mind is from from God I mean brother Bram tells the story in the church age book of St Martin when he was sitting there and the angel of Light appeared to him and said worship me St Martin I'm your God and he said it look the real deal except that because he knew the word he knew that ah this one was crowned and we're only going to crown him later amen and he said depart from me amen that's how fine it is my brothers and sisters today we are living in a voice in the day of a voice am mean Revelations 10 in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when all the mystery has been revealed but the reality is there's every single false Doctrine in the message believ they are the real message amen and from their perspective they believe that they've got it right and we've got it wrong amen and and the reality is from everyone's perspective they are you are in the middle of the road and everyone else is either the side off or that side off we need God Amen and and do not fear this is not about saying saying to you this is impossible because it's not impossible because there is a holy spirit there is a rebirth Hallelujah but your own understanding is a voice and sometimes that voice inside you is at odds with God's voice sometimes the voice of your understanding is at odds with the Revelation 10 voice unfortunately when people switch on the message I've seen it over and over and over again they hear the message through their own filter they hear the message based on how they want it to sound amen and you know what it is impossible for you to explain it to someone in a different way than they believe it unless God comes on on the scene and he changes that person's understanding my brothers and sisters I strongly believe this is something Supernatural that we need with this word amen remember we've been speaking about people with different views only God can really pull that person to the middle of the road I'm saying me let me point the the the finger to me only God can keep me in the middle of the road when I go off amen because it's something that only he can do because I cannot judge my understanding from my understanding how do I do that I'm biased I mean of course I'm right I've always been right of course amen just everyone else has kind of wavered around am mean that's just how we human beings are am mean just prideful to start off with so we've spoken about a whole lot of voices and really a whole lot of teachers that are trying to teach us and like I said many times even though it comes with a message label it's actually inspired by Satan now you can very quickly be nervous when I say this kind of thing brother random says if it's 99% word and 1% hybrid it becomes satanic a Twist in the truth is no longer the truth I want to play short video clip to you and I'm sure most of you have seen it anyway but just wanted to show that principle all right ladies there it is there's three wires and three of us is that supposed to mean something yeah means we better be cutting one of these wires and we going to be all over this place I mean all over okay wait wait remember the captain was training us some bomb deactivation he specifically stressed you cut the red wire oh really well my captain taught us specifically to cut the blue wire red wire blue wire you both out HS everybody knows you cut the yellow wire yellow wire dude who's been teaching you does it really matter it certainly does at a time like this you better believe it I'm telling you it's the red wire blue wire look let's flip for it flip for it are you insane you cut the wrong wire here you'll be the one doing the flipping all over the place I mean all over I think you guys are making this thing bigger than what it is we got a minute and 12 seconds left I'm telling you it's the red wire maybe you're right guys I think I should tell you this now just in case it becomes an issue save the emotional stuff Vin there's plenty of time for that later I'm color blind color blind you're about as useful as a one-legged soccer player time is running out here I'm walking in on that I'm walking in on the red which one's the red one no no no no no no no what on Earth okay look let's just do this huh what you say it's the red one you say it's the yellow one and I say it's the blue one how about we each cut one what well one of them's got to be the one and two of them isn't that's the point big I'm telling you guys it's the red one but if we don't do something quick it's not really going to matter much I was taught it was red and I was taught it was blue I was taught it doesn't matter here we go [Music] it's so important who teaches you because it will make the difference between life and death and like I said there's all those voices there's all these teachers there's all these influences when Jesus was about to leave the Earth what did he say the Holy Spirit would do he said but the comforter with which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you I mean he said I will send you the real teacher and he will be on the inside of the inside amen an inner teacher that's exactly what happened that Holy Spirit brought to their memory the things that Jesus said to the point where they could write the the the gospels down and so forth but it didn't stop their brothers and sisters amen he also taught them further he opened to them further amen he continued to break the word to those Apostles and they preached for years and years and years and years after three and a half years of teaching from Jesus amen that's why Paul could say now remember he never even met Jesus but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man for I neither received it of neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ so the Holy Spirit was going to be the teacher through seven Church ages and he's still the teacher for you and me today amen and if we can get quiet enough to hear that still Small Voice that's where we want to be my brothers and sisters the Bride of every age will be tuned to hear to receive what he says to the the churches Amen in fact every letter to those seven Church ages says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches what he's saying is let every individual that's predestinated in every age listen to that still small voice of what the teacher says inside of you because he will teach you amen praise the Lord Brother Bram says when Nicodemus came to him and Nicodemus called him a teacher sent from God I mean he says Jesus cut him s short and he says Jesus's words could be paraphrased like this I am not a teacher Hang on we're speaking about Jesus here amen he says I'm not a teacher I'm am the sacrificial lamb for sin I am making possible the New Birth by my spirit but there's a coming one who is the teacher he is the holy spirit when Jesus was upon the Earth he came as the lamb and as the prophet but when he came back upon the church by his Spirit he became the teacher and that's the teacher we need amen that Holy Spirit and I'll put it in message terms now that said I'm going to ride this triail once more he's doing it we're not waiting for Brother brandom to come back amen the prophet has decreased he has increased he's now riding this TR once more he's now personally my brothers and sisters teaching his precious bride he's personally revealing to us his word now inside of us am mean there's a certain class of people people that's predestinated to hear not a class that's better than anyone amen not a class that's more important that's not a class that can look down on anyone there's not a class that can become prideful or anything but there's a predestinated group of people am mean while the rest of the people cannot under any circumstances receive the full word this class does brother bam says it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages absolutely impossible but only that elected group can hear it and will hear it am mean this cannot be fixed with better ear doctors this cannot be fixed this is nothing to do with our natural hearing remember many of these voices we spoke about is not natural voices amen it's voices that's built into our Spirits amen our culture our understanding our thinking patterns our conscience our pride our hurts our complexes all those things amen we need something stronger than all those things and he is stronger than all those things Hallelujah this isn't about the ability to hear naturally it's not there it's not about going to the doctor and doing a hearing test my brothers and sisters it's got nothing to do with that amen when Jesus's disciple disciples asked him why he was teaching in parables am mean he answered them in this way says therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and the ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they would should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand stand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they here hallelujah I wonder if we can turn together to to 1 Corinthians 2 excuse me Paul writing to the Corinthian ch Now 1 Corinthians 2 and we'll start from verse 6 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written eye hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God Amen has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God hallelujah again that inner teacher my brothers and sisters verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God no earthly messenger unless the Heavenly messenger meets him no earthly voice unless God is actually using that voice amen now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God Amen without fussing and stewing and breaking our heads about it God freely gives them to his elected Hallelujah which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who ha known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ Hallelujah so what we speaking about my brothers and sisters is a spiritual discernment amen there's a few things I want to highlight about this ability to hear first of all it's only to predestinated people whose origin is God we come from God Amen we came out of God Amen our origin our origin is God and therefore we can hear God Amen the second thing is it's only the spirit of God in us by the spirit of God in us that we know his word our Human Side my brothers and sisters we have nothing to boast about am mean we're not more clever we're not better we're not cleaner we're not we're not less born in sin shaped in iniquity amen it's all his grace and it's only by his spirit in us and thirdly it's not understood by the natural man now I believe there's two sides of that amen first of all only the spiritual the spiritually predestinated people can really receive this word but also there's a very important part amen it's actually only the real you inside that completely receives the word our body and our human spirit I mean there's so much that we don't understand but still something inside us says yes Lord even though I don't understand it it am mean I believe it with all my heart am mean there's a song that says I you don't have to understand you just have to hold his hand amen yeah we're not saying that okay so don't study the message that's what I'm saying but what I'm saying is it's not about your intellect it's not about you being able to explain everything in the word but it's it's it's about meeting the author and the author that spiritual teacher inside of you making the word alive and known to us in in our inside amen then there's the opposite group we read bit about that in John 8 Jesus said unto them if God were your father I mean speaking to the Pharisees now if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word hang on Jesus we are standing here we listening to you but that's not what he's speaking about he's saying you don't have that inner teacher you don't have that predestinated ability to hear me he said you are of the Father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth excuse me because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he's a liar and the father of it amen I mean there's that separate group now for that group they have some attributes they don't have God as their origin obviously the opposite amen they're Guided by the spirit of Satan and the tree of knowledge and this is so sometimes it's tend to say these kind of things but brothers and sisters there's people in this message claiming to be in the message that's only eating from the Tree of knowledge the intellectual understand understanding of how the different things fit together Hallelujah I trust that's okay some people can only understand naturally so obviously it won't help us to keep on growing bigger ears amen that's not the type of hearing that God is after here we go amen God is broadcasting his word perfectly clearly because that's his business to do it but there's nothing you can do to make yourself genuinely receive and hear that word what we need is a spiritual antenna that's in tune with the word of God can you get the audio up if your receiver is not tuned to receive it you can't receive it and that doesn't say there's anything wrong with the transmitter the transmitter is transmitting perfect amen God's word has been expressed God's word has been released straight out to us amen there's nothing wrong with God's side but on our side oops are we gone okay on our side when we get in tune with the word am mean we receive if we get in tune with God and there's only one thing that makes us or that gives us the ability to receive brother R speaks about that Crystal amen you know what the crystal in our hearts is okay so there's the radio transmitting at the wrong frequency when we tune in we start hearing the truth amen let me start receiving the crystal in our heart that gives us the ability to receive my brothers and sisters is the C Gene of God Amen is that predestinated c Gene of what God placed in us from the beginning brother Bron makes this statement he says it's most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear God come on let's get that really in our minds no man of himself can hear God that ability has to be given to him of God I mean the Bible speaks about how by thinking you can't add a foot to your to your stature or however that scripture is I mean the point is you can't make yourself better you can't make yourself uh uh get Revelation you can't make yourself grow closer to God by your own effort there's only one way he has to draw and you have to submit you die to yourself and you say God nothing in my hands I bring simply to your cross I cllean amen and when by God's grace those voices can dim out in the background and you can start hearing that still Small Voice that's what it's about amen Jesus confirms this with Simon with Peter he said blessed are th Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto you but my father Father which is in heaven brother Ram actually makes a statement he says when Jesus and Peter was speaking and Jesus caught that Revelation go um Jesus knew sorry when when Peter caught that Revelation Jesus knew that this was more than just a natural understanding amen when Peter responded in the way he did amen I believe Jesus's heart swelled up and says praise the Lord someone has received a revelation directly from God Amen and that my brother and sister sister is what every son and daughter needs today that same Revelation and there is a group of people that can receive that's been predestinated to receive that has the spirit of God and who are born of God in other words the children of God the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when someone is taught by that inner teacher amen someone that receives and hears and sees the word for your day and in its season brother Bram is very clear about those things I mean the evidence is genuinely hearing what the spirit says to you person however there's a challenge with that because many people in message circles claim to have the rebirth because they can explain the message that's not what it's about it's not just because you can explain the seven everything amen I love the seven everything it's because it's Revelation it's so dear to me amen but but what I'm saying is just to be able to explain it does not say that you've got the rebirth the rebirth is when the word takes over your life when the word starts living itself out through you and that's Revelation that's not human attempt that's not us pretending that's not make belief that's not us trying to be better than the next one or better than ourselves I mean that's when God comes on the scene and God does it for you and God reveals it to you I've seen it so many times people claim to have the Holy Spirit just because they can understand the message but if all you have is an intellectual understanding my brothers and sisters it's not going to get you in the Rapture you need faith and Faith Comes only by Revelation personal very personal in individual revelation of what God did for you and what God is going to do for you when it comes to the time of the body change amen like like Enoch that you can just take another step amen it's not suddenly oh goodness there's something got to happen he just took another step am mean because he was in that relationship with God brother Bram says when scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time that's exactly correct and if these ages bring out anything they surely bring and bear out this truth you need the holy spirit inside to receive that's why I emphasized for every age I I'll move away from these things soon but I trust that you have it amen but that's why he emphasizes to every age you are so and so and this is your attributes and I see your works and I see your suffering and I see your labor and all those things and many identifies that he says but for every age amen every age those with a spiritual hearing will hear what the spirit says to the churches you can say well I believe the message but if all you have is that intellectual understanding it won't do you any more good than saying Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago hey so many people says that Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago you can read it in Joseph's historical writing and he doesn't even believe in Jesus amen and he believed it when he wrote it but the point is brothers and sisters if God reveals to you the significance the personal application of that that's where it comes amen until that historical fact becomes a personal and tangible reality for you that starts driving your thinking from the inside that starts impacting on how you look at other people around you how you look at the word how you look at circumstances how you respond when things in life are thrown in your direction until that point it means nothing to just understand it James wrote what brother bam quoted quite a few times thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble that pops the balloom quickly doesn't it but will thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead if you genuinely have a revelation Works Will Follow The Life of Christ will be lived out through you brother BR says he told us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Spirit was that we would have the teacher come and teach us all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day I want to put it this way and and and again this can sound like I'm actually saying a negative thing about it but you can have brother bram's message playing 24/7 in your house walk with it in your ears 247 but until the inner teacher makes it alive it won't benefit you now I'm not saying it's bad to do that of course go on do it by all means amen but what I'm saying is is all if all you hear is words being expressed it's not going to help you in every age in every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the true believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it it lived itself out through them now you cannot cut that quote in two amen you can't just take the first part amen the spirit in them took the word and thought it the other part is also amen they lived it it made itself manifest in their life we cannot live this word by sheer will I mean brother Bram says there's many Christian signs that live better lives than people with a true Holy Ghost baptism you cannot add to the word or take away from it and still claim to have the Holy Ghost but that teacher needs to come on the inside and personally reveal it to us hallelujah so I want to put it in this in this kind of terminology in this time when the seventh seal is open now which we believe it is amen when our bridegroom is here now what is Jacob saying to Rebecca in the tent or in other words what is Jesus saying to you personally in your tent in your Tabernacle I want to speak about one more teacher and then I want to get to the point that I that I really wanted to build up to there's one more teacher that brother Bram speaks about and that is your theophan and one John 1:14 how the word became flesh and belt Among Us brother Ram speaks about how the first expression that came out of God was the logos the word amen now that John 1:1 in the beginning was the word that was the logos the word was the first expression of God I mean brother bam he puts it in this way he says that logos it was the first expression out of out you know before that was just that spirit being that f time and space and our human Minds couldn't even uh cope with trying to imagine what it's like because we can't imagine space big enough we couldn't imagine time far enough amen so God expressed himself in word form in low God form so that we as human beings could start relate Amen to how he was but there's another part of that brother bam says the thought that was in God's uh inside of God in that spirit of God was now expressed in word form and remember how it works it's thought words manifestation now if you look at Jesus he was the manifestation of the logos so eternal spirit logos expression Jesus I hope I'm not going to fuss but I'm sure we all know these things amen now brother Brandon makes this statement he says his first being was Spirit God Supernatural all right the great eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this is when it then this thing is the state he was in when he met Abraham he was called MDC he was in the form of theophany now we get into that and prove it in a few minutes the Lord willing he was the word a theophany is something that you could not see it could be right here now yet you cannot see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing There's colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to Five Senses rather and you are only subject to what the site has been limited to see but there's another dimension that can be seen by transformation by television now why I put this up was the logos was God's theopen amen the logos was God's word expression our theophonic now we don't have time to spend a lot of time on that but there's just one or two things I would like to say about that theophany Amen brother Ram speaks about how that um we become subject to the word when we get the rebirth brother R speaks about how the holy spirit is not bringing us uh that if the holy spirit is not bringing us to the middle of the road amen it might not be the Holy Spirit he speaks about how that theophyl enters that body is what brother Adam shows us now he says that theophany is hanging around us now and by the time it's either our death or our body change we step over into that theophany but and here's the point I really want to get to he speaks about how we start hearing from our theophany now there's a beauty Beau beautiful principle there that you know these things can be so conceptual that it's kind of I don't want to say meaningless but it doesn't become personal but what I want to say is you had an attribute in God's mind if you believe you predestinated in God's mind there was something that he had an attribute of you that he wanted to express and then that thought became word and the word expression of your attribute is your theophonic [Music] Amen to where God intended you to be if we put it in completely different terms God had a vision for you very personal very specific very directly for you and for me amen and that theophany I believe is the one that leads us into that purpose that leads us to fulfill that purpose I mean brother brandom speaks about just going to quote this here we refers to that term and after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting he refers to that in so many places where he says when we die our theophany is there or when we go in the body change and so forth so in other words your personal word attribute that's an expression of the Eternal thoughts of God thoughts that have become word will speak directly and personally to you it will influence your soul to have faith it will influence your soul to believe the word completely in a soul realm now amen we're not talking about just an intellectual understanding but I believe it also will start from the heart from the Throne of your soul start impacting your human spirit amen to cast out everything that doesn't align with the word will the battle stop never bad news but good good news too amen we looking forward to that body change amen but that battle will never stop but from that Throne he will start influencing you amen and depending on which dog we feed that depend that determines which side we lean to amen our imaginations our understanding our conscience Etc I believe will be influenced by The Guiding of that uh leadership and our body will start expressing the faith that's on the inside because we read Works without faith is dead the title to this message could also have been what your theopen he sees to you amen and that's really where I wanted to come so now I just want to look at a few practical applications and I hope you have a few minutes for me to to just go through these things I hope you're not getting too tired and restless but but really there's a few practical things that that I believe the Lord really placed on my heart to to go to this morning we want to be in the middle of the road Amen brother Bram speaks about how we can so quickly go off on one side and go off on another side we want to be in the middle of the road with everything and with all the voices what I want is that I want to hear what God is saying to me and remember we spoke about how important it is that we don't go on what the next person says how the next person look at something but what God is saying to me personally amen based on where each of us are at and based on the other voices in our lives but especially our own understanding and perspectives each one of us needs to ask God to help us to listen to what he is saying to us individually I mean like I said we all think our own balance is the right balance we all think we're in the middle of the road we tend to think that you know others need to line up with our thinking but sometimes we need to align with God's thinking and I'm going to share a little secret with you this is probably one of the most difficult things for a pastor or a minister because like I said there's so many voices the pastor can preach it the minister can preach it in a specific way am mean and when some people are leaning this way you preach it that way to bring them to the middle and then what happens is all they do is they go stream brother so and so that's preaching it that way so Amen brother preacher instead of hearing to what the Lord is saying or you go preach it this way and they leaning that way but brothers so and so in Church Fellowship with them after church and N don't worry about that amen so many voices I hope it's okay to share these things but it's very realistic very real amen now we read in Corinthians Paul's puts those things in in place and so forth when they're speaking in tongues and all those things brother Bram thought us so clearly there's there's something that the churches have abandoned I mean the Pentecostal churches that's become just a big mess of speaking in tongues and just everyone do their own thing there's an important part that they forget spiritual discernment amen all those gifts need to be subject to spiritual discernment amen someone with genuine Holy Ghost discernment to say is it of God or isn't it brother bam speaks about how we don't just receive a message that anyone jump up and give to the church we need two or three witnesses that this is of God we need that discernment now I believe now the Bible speaks about now if that in fact brother Bron makes a statement he says if that if that speaking in tongues is wrong and the discernment find it finds it's wrong or if the discernment thinks it's right and it proves excuse me proves to be wrong he says then you've got an evil spirit among you amen then you need to go on your knees and ask God to take that Spirit out from among us but unfortunately sometimes we just accept everything everyone says to us us everyone's opinions everyone's imbalances everyone's perspectives based on where they come from based on all those voices that we spoke about I've seen our insecurities sorry how insecure people get flattened Under Pressure like this trying to be men Pleasers trying to hear every voice that comes their way and trying to keep everyone happy I'm sure some of you have experienced some of these things it's very real brother so and so comes visits and you know you're only spiritual if you can do this and sister so and so come visits and you're only spiritual if you can do that and all this or you stream this um brother here and you stream that brother there sorry I'm not I'm not fighting streaming I mean that's between you and the Lord amen I'm just saying there's pet Falls in there that we need to be very careful for amen we need to find what God is saying to you personally and sometimes we just want to be men Pleasers we just want to do everything that we here instead of discerning is this for me am mean the Bible speaks about people being blown away by every wind of Doctrine amen come on that's what the Holy Ghost is for that's what God is for I mean what you need to find out is what God is saying to you not to someone else you know sometimes we sit in church and we when we hear something come over the pulpit I hope sister so and so is listening I hope brother so and so is listening amen but what's God saying to me we can so easily miss our message amen even though we all believe in this message and we say we believe in the message we come from all those different backgrounds I mean brother Bram summarizes the the difficulty in a minister speaking in this way he says these things was all in my mind you can imagine what's in a man's heart when you put up with that seat to think of what is taking place and know to tell the people know KN that some will get the wrong slant and some will go this way and that way and you know how it is some will believe and some won't but that's what you have to put up with how can you say it without hurting how can you say it that it will take effect how can you say it to show the people that you're not picking on them that you love them how can you be strict and firm and yet loving oh how you going to present it and then woe woe onto me if I don't present it see it summarizes how a minister I mean God put something on your heart but but also there's another part of that there's no way I can force any thought into anyone's head if God doesn't open it to that individual there's nothing I can do just some of my practical work experience I worked as a project manager for quite a few years here in New Zealand and you know I I sometimes it was just so hard my team I mean I would I would ask to someone I I would ask someone to do something and two or 3 days later they come and they they've done something completely different they've completely misunderstood what I said and if I go back at what I said and what they understood I said I can see how they understood it based on their preconceived ideas and I got to a point where if I gave my team a task that that's going to take them longer than just a few hours I would actually say to them explain back to me what you think I've just said to you and so often they would explain it completely different and would say no no no you thought that in your head that's not what I said that's just human beings now in the church setting you have an extra thing against you because Satan will do everything in his in his power to fight against you to twist it to abuse it so that you get the wrong slant amen I cannot make as a minister cannot make you see it the way I see it amen but praise the lord it's not important that you see it how I see it it's important that the Holy Spirit teaches you personally how he wants you to see it that's for me that's one of the most blessed things I just rejoice in it so much when I Minister and and while I'm preaching God just led me down a little Rabbit Trail here and down a rabbit Trail here and someone would come back afterwards and say brother when you said that it was a real blessing to me oh that wasn't even on my notes you see because the Holy Spirit uses those things God can use ministers I mean sometimes I think and I know this is you know this is this is going overboard but sometimes I think all God needs is a little framework and a minister to stand here so that he can come on the scene and he can address supernaturally the things that we need but if it's about us wanting to be seen we need to get back to the altar my brothers and sisters I mean only God can do that work so just a few things that that that I want to quickly run through sometimes we can have a very um Armenian type of frame of mind and and I know that I've spoken quite extensively about that in the past a kind of legalistic approach where we can so quickly put pressures on one another and criticize one another and judge one another and hurt one another and throw stones at one another amen when we don't match up or when the outside doesn't line up with with the word and so forth am mean but the other side of it is I mean God may be working with an individual God may be dealing with that individual and if there's any slightest inkling of an idea that you are better than that person that you are more spiritual than that person you have a major problem my brothers and sisters amen you are not better than anyone but for Christ Living on the inside I mean we are all I mean one of the things brother nesto ministered that was just so special for me was how he just showed we all start at base zero amen we all have come from that mixed race amen we all hybrid s the seed of the serpent was mixed into the whole human race amen we cannot claim that I am pure and you not we all start from nothing we all need the grace of God so much but our attitude often times doesn't reflect the attitude of Jesus Jus Christ he could say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing interceding on his behalf taking our roles as priests interceding saying Lord please open to my brother please open to my sister lord they're not seeing what your word expects them amen but please open to them am mean that's the kind of attitude sighing and crying on their behalf rather than throwing stones at them I me that's just going to kill them or we can have the calvinistic view where we just God doesn't care amen I am justified praise the Lord and now God doesn't care what I do that's nonsense that might have worked in Luther's day but it's not for us anymore my brothers and sisters amen I am justified only by the blood of Christ only by the blood of Christ I have nothing more that I can bring to him but if that inner teacher is living in your heart my brother and sister that inner teacher is going to teach you the ways of God that he going to think through through you the thinking of God he's going to live through you the word of God Amen the the the things that the Bible speaks about in terms of um uh uh how we should conduct ourselves and things I think that things that the prophet opened up in our day where he showed us this is how a man should dress this is how a woman should dress this is our contact conduct around one another all those things my brothers and sisters he meant it amen now we don't go around and whack people on the head with it but what we want to do is just like I said with the calvinistic side we want to ask God to bring it to pass we want those things to be L from the inside when the inside life is a lamb life it will bring forth wool amen and this Holy Ghost will not bring forth Crow feathers amen this holy ghost ghost will bring forth the life of Jesus Christ amen so our standard is still the word standard but if we're insecure what we do is we we start judging people around us we start throwing stones at them and all those kind of things or and and if we don't have that real genuine personal revelation of Jesus Christ we become lacked God doesn't mind about my clothing it's okay to put a bit of makeup on it's it's okay I mean I don't want to preach those things in someone else's ppit God knows amen but but the reality is brothers and sisters when you're in relationship with Christ he will guide you to full truth amen he will he will himself teach you I mean you know what a some of the most wonderful testimonies that I so rejoice in there was a sister I think it was a Chinese sister in one of the islands in the South Pacific I can't remember I think I can't remember if it was PNG or one of the islands where in the area where she lived there was no message Believers God led her to online find the message she started studying the message no contact with Believers whatsoever and a few years later she came in contact with Believers she started going to a church she found a church that was somewhere we where she could reach it and so forth and her life had lined up with the word so beautifully that her conduct was better than people that had been sitting in church now my brothers and sisters that's what the Holy Ghost will do that's not legalism that's not legalism when you do what the word says do from your heart not because brother so and so criticize me and sister so and so talks bad about me that's just human pressure nonsense I mean but the Holy Ghost in us will do the right thing so now I'm sorry I'm just going to make it pretty explicit okay to to to make the point we can sit in church now amen and brother Ben I'm going to make him the bad guy now praise the Lord so brother Ben is is preaching and he might be hammering amen am mean because he sees maybe there's something not right he might be hammering something and saying sisters we need to look at our clothing Brothers we need to look at our conduct and so forth amen and maybe God is saying something to you and you need to sit and listen and say God are you telling me something not oh I hope sister son so is listening but now you can't oh but at home I've got brother son so sedes that he says we shouldn't judge one another am mean my brothers and sisters what you're doing is you're working against God and that's the point what is God saying to you today amen or the other way around amen when when God is pre preaching ing mercy and Grace and and nonjudgmentalism and so forth amen and and and you think my goodness brother Ben is not upholding the standard I mean so let's get someone in here who's you know my brothers and sisters you might be missing what God is telling you and often when we have this kind of leaning amen our natural tendency is we go and Heap ourselves teachers because we have itching ears because we want to do what we want to do and we don't want anyone to tell us one to do pigheaded human pride and actually what we do is we bind the hands of the Holy Spirit to actually do something for us because we lend our ears only to those which we want amen there's things around Faith and Healing amen it's one of my favorite things to speak about brother Bram speaks about how he every time his children got sick he took them to the doctor brother Brandon amen I read a quot to the church the other day where he speaks about how a specific sister in in in that that he had um helped in a private interview he said I went through their life sorry I don't have the quote with me he says I went through their life and I searched where the issue was because their daughter was sick and he says the only thing I could found could find was they believed that it was unspiritual I put it in my own words I can't remember exactly how the prophet put it to take medication and I dealt with that and I said to a sister that's nonsense and the kid took her medication and she got better now how spiritual is that we have a prophet here that could just lay hands on her and she could be better that's Religious brothers and sisters that's a religious spirit spirit amen but the flip side to that is if God reveals to you personally not sister so and so saying it's bad to take medicine because you're not so spiritual as her or brother so and so that's just all the human garbage that's all human voices because of their own insecurities and they're not where they should be with God or whatever reasons and it can come through like I said a very beautiful close friend that's also in the message go what God shows you amen when God has shown you if you've got cancer and God has shown you you are healed you Chuck all your medication in the rubbish B amen but God needs to tell you amen not because someone else wants you to be religious to feed their own little religious family or whatever amen God needs to tell you that's what I love about this message there's a balance Amen brother Brandon makes statements he says if we believed enough God may even give us a cure for what was it cancer or something hang on why can't God just heal the people he speaks about how we should be praying for the medical profession and then on the other hand he's speaking about how we don't need those people if God comes on the scene there's a balance my brothers and sisters and every case is unique amen and today it might be that God wants you to go to the doctor and take the medicine and tomorrow it might be that God wants to show you Faith amen and it's not your choosing sorry but it's not amen God chooses because he's he's got the right to do that yes amen hallelujah I think I've covered quite extensively Doctrine just the intellectual understanding I mean we could put pressure on other people if you don't understand this or if you don't listen to brother so and so or if or if you're not able to cope with you know 3 hours of service or whatever stuff there's so much nonsense that people put pressure on one another for am mean there's so much pressure where people can just you know want to compete how much I know let's check you know kind of I mean we don't do it openly but in reality I know I've been there for so many years oh the are speaking let's see how much I can show them how much I know come on you're insecure you're not mature amen let's just be real like I said in the beginning for me this message is just becoming simpler and simpler and simpler but speak to a denominational person for 5 minutes and you will see how much God has made known to you the message is only simple because God has revealed it to you because we don't have to do this Out Of Reach stuff that we can't understand God makes it the Bible says he makes it known to his beloved in his sleep amen God gives it to us freely but while we're trying to compete for the next person I mean we're breaking our faith down come on let's be real we serving a reality God Amen we may have like I said I spoke to AB about Absalom earlier we might have opinions of how to run the church and we might have opinions about how to run the music and we might have opinions about how sister so and so should be raising her kids and how brother so and so should be conducting his marriage and all that stuff my brothers and sisters is actually a waste of time if the Holy Spirit doesn't help that person but what we can do and what we should be doing is spend time on our knees we need to focus Less on Theology and much more on neology Amen praying for our brothers and sisters praying that God Amen if you don't agree with how the music is happening in the church and I I'm picking something that I know won't be a problem but if you don't agree with how it's done go on your knees and ask God God either change me or change the music amen then God will will make it happen you know I'm just I know God is blessing you with with with all these music and and things and and God is giving you songs and and music music and things and it's wonderful I I praise God for that but be careful that that doesn't become a new new pressure I mean you're only spiritual if you've written a song or you only you know it can SE human stuff I mean Satan just jumps in on everything and wants to make it a pressure I mean it's Sovereign it's God giving it am mean if it's in any other way it's glorifying you and not God make sure that God gets the glory I said this earlier but our attitude can can often be reflected this way why beholdest thou the moat that's in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that's in thine own eye we know that we are so good at that as human beings in 2 Timothy 4 the scripture says for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap up to he Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables and those teachers don't have to be ministers behind the pulpit that teacher can be your brother your sister your friend your phone buddy your whatever we can so easily search until marriage and divorce is a is a wonderful example one that I've seen in the past couple wants to get married to go to their Pastor he says no the way I look at the word you can't get married no problem we'll search a pastor that will marry us it's exactly what people do with so many other things we look around until we find someone that agrees with us instead of going to God God am I wrong please change me if I'm wrong I want to have your perfect will amen I'm really winding down I won't be long I promise I mean I just want to speak about us being bullboards for a moment and ask you what bullboard are you are you reflecting your understanding your goodness your know knowledge or are you only reflecting The Life of Christ are you pushing your unbalanced perspectives or are you willing to die out to yourself and let only him speak through you what are you selling are you selling a Pentecostal idea of riches and wealth or of uncontrolled gifts with no discernment necessary are we selling a Lutheran Doctrine or a wsan Doctrine where it's our human works or where it's just K God wouldn't care God doesn't care God doesn't judge how easily are we upset by the liberalist amen I've seen it brothers and sisters I've seen it so many times a visiting Minister will come and he will deal with things and and he will be preaching a little bit of of clothline preaching or something and then suddenly everyone wants to be you know legalists and then the next Minister comes and he preaches Grace and everyone is don't worry God is come on let's mature amen amen because sometimes God is dealing with one person in the church amen and the rest of us that specific service is not intended for amen but now everyone else gets nervous people that generally tend to legalism I mean here comes a minister past that that that preaches the legalistic kind of perspective maybe and and when I say legalistic I mean just you know focus on the dos and don't sub it because it's part of the word I mean we don't throw those things away amen and then all the people that tend to to lean towards legalism all get nervous God am I right with you am I doing all the right stuff am I amen instead God's trying to deal with someone that's leaning over to the liberal side and the other way too I mean if you are finding yourself to be too liberal with the word pull up your socks get yourself ready time is up I mean we can't muck around but when I preach that to someone that is leaning towards liberalism sorry towards legalism makes them all fearful we're not supposed to be ruled by fear perfect love casts out all fear we have nothing to be afraid about God has overcome 2,000 years ago and we are the recipients of the Redemption plan I mean there's nothing that can keep you out of hell my brother brother and sister all the devils in hell can't keep you out of hell sorry can't can't keep you out of Heaven amen sorry the other way around amen nothing that anyone can do my brothers and sisters can keep you out of Eternity Hallelujah if you're a predestinated son and daughter of god so let's just submit to him amen so are we confident in what we do we're driven by fear driven by other people's fear driven by what other people say how other people criticize are we displaying only the doctrine the letter or we also displaying the spirit of the word amen are we representing ourselves or are we representing Jesus Christ amen do we speak our theories as if it was the word you push your views of things on others or do you actually reflect only the word when you have your own idea do you say like brother Marcus Beaker always says say now this is Marcus okay okay Hallelujah okay okay he says this is Marcus what he's say saying through that is this is my understanding this is not the word but this is how I see it amen if we can humble oursel like that not just preach it as if it is the word and tomorrow we say something else because God has shown us more that confuses people especially our children amen let's just be normal Hallelujah are we Billboards for the latest fashions the latest name brands do we want to show forth our financial success are we caught up in the Chas to keep up with the Joneses or do we show forth a testimony of the reality of Jesus Christ it might not be a Bed of Roses on this side but we have all our amen gold and silver on the other side amen keeping it there with moth and rust cannot cannot uh take away from it amen so we can ask the question how on Earth do we do that how on Earth do we get that right I can't be my own judge I can't from my own human Spirit judge my own human spirit amen and you're absolutely right you can't I can't but what we can do is like I said go on your knees to God ask him to help you die out to ourselves and be sensitive to his still Small Voice amen so that he can help us to be willing to follow that inside teacher and follow out the offering amen I'm just going to close there I'm sorry for taking a little longer than I intended to but I trust that the Lord did something that would be a blessing to you let's just stand and pray together gracious and loving Lord Jesus God we just appreciate your word Lord father just appreciate Lord that we can relaxing you father Lord that we can just know Lord that you're in control father God and I want to ask like I've asked so many times God let me die to myself completely father father my own ideas my own perspectives Lord anything that's not perfectly in line with you take those things out of me Lord father I thank you for this precious group of people this morning Lord I pray for each and every one Lord that you will touch every heart Lord father that the things that

it out of our minds father Lord and I pray that Lord your your people will have a blessing Lord that will continue to bless them as they go forward father we love you and appreciate you Lord I pray that if there's anyone here this morning Lord that's Lord affected in any of the ways that we've spoken about Lord may be unbalanced in any of these ways I pray that you will bring the balance father Lord Jesus I pray that you will give us Grace Lord to go beyond our human Prides and our own ways of thinking and to accept your way of thinking God open your word just more and more to us father Lord and I pray that you will just make us humble before you Lord give us Grace Lord to minister to one another Lord with your attitude your spirit that was willing Lord to go on your knees and become a footwash flunky lord lord we love you and appreciate you Lord I pray that you will bless this church bless brother Ben Lord and bring him back safely and continue to be with them or that them go
