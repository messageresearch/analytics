the Lord good morning how you feeling this morning feeling nice and happy good refreshed ready to praise the Lord amen you um you old folks here or maybe not too old or even young fellas be honest you know when you sleep in a different bed you kind of like don't sleep that well you know it's not your usual environment you look up you look around it's not the things aren't where they should be you don't sleep as well no problem there no yeah I had an awful sleep last night can I just say that but I didn't actually stay here though so do you want to hear the story I I I was so tired I think I've been overw worked and kind of but run down so you just get more and more tired as the days go on less sleep you kind of just run down down down down and then last night I was up till the we hours of the morning and then I'm actually staying at home cuz we had just worked bit that way but man I was so tired when I got back and I thought I'll just lay on the on the couch for a second and then that was it bang I was gone suit and all you know woke up this morning about 6:45 cuz I had to leave about 7:30 I'm like man and my you know when that you don't really plan it the sleep so it's just cushions and your neck's going all weird and you're like yeah so and I had the sore throat you know when you're your throat swells up you're like oh man but but that uh but a little sore throat ain't going to stop you know you're from going to church or something you know like like what did we hear last night presson you know I I I I've got a confidence in people PE people have got such powerful creatures you know we're such amazing beings the Lord's made us so powerful you know that we can press in we can have when even and when we serve God and let the character of God come and and let God work on our character we can have so much resolve you know we can have so much tenacity we can have so much ability to press forward you believe that that's that's who you are we're not we're not just little unimportant things that weren't made very well we were made very good you know and and the Lord made us outstanding and and you know we we we've got this ability to press in to the Lord and and but you know the the the the great thing thing about it is is that when we when that all sort of comes to an end and sometimes it does our our inability to press on kind of even no matter how strong we are there's actually comes a point where we're like man I just can't do it anymore and the great thing about being a Christian is that at that point there's this there's this power of the Holy Ghost that has got the ability in that situation to come in and to keep you going and to press you through anything any situation any obstacle this is inexhaustible Fountain of strength that we can draw on that and brother Andrew said it last night he asked about the he said I I think he mentioned brother Chris or you know when you're when you're looking in the mirror and you're wife here do you say I'm undefeatable I tell you this about a month ago I wasn't quite looking in the mirror but I was sitting in the car and there was a mirror there so maybe that counts brother Andrew and in light of saying or this what I just said to you there I was just expounding it to Shannon and at the end I said and you know what I'm undefeatable but you we all are that's who we are we are undefeatable if it started back here and it's going to end up there that means you're undefeatable so that's who we are today amen let's um sing cast your burdens unto Jesus Oh cast your burdens unto Jesus for he

just relax in his presence this morning and and feed on his word amen I just want to greet you in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ and bring you greetings from Canada and uh there so many connections and families and friends so we wouldn't have time to go through all the names and so forth but we just want to extend you uh u a greetings from your extended family amen the family of God on the other side of the world Amen and I just uh just counted a real honor real privilege to be standing here in front of you today want to say thank you to brother Ben for inviting me not for preaching but so that I can be here in this atmosphere and here our brother Andrew Minister it's the first time I I get to meet brother Andrew and and here and Minister and I just want to say I was truly blessed last night how many enjoyed the word last night amen last after last night we could just wrap up the services and go home that's how I felt but uh anyway we find ourselves here this morning and uh we're just going to trust in the Lord amen what we're going to keep building one brick upon brick and uh word upon word and precept upon precept line upon line amen so at this at this time I just invite you to turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Luke 4: 16 Luke 4 and 16 and I want to speak this morning uh on a on a kind of a topic living in the Supernatural atmosphere living in the Supernatural atmosphere I believe that um the Lord has done something for us as Believers amen we are uh we've been called uh out from the uh influences of this world we've been called out from the influences of the devil you know the devil has no say over us he has no to do with us amen uh we are hidden hidden in Christ and if the Lord is is allmighty and all powerful which we believe he is if he hides somebody I would say he's pretty good at that and so if we are hidden in Christ how can the devil even know where you are know how to attack you how can he even touch you affect you amen so we've been called to live in Heavenly places this is the Ephesian time this is the uh you know brother brandom says that we will come into our Ephesian amen and for those of you who understand the message we know that that is literally coming into the the full stature of a perfect man that is Christ in us you know it comes a day when you can't you it's hard to to um discern where the line is where Christ begins and where where we begin or where we uh end and he ends amen there's just this uh beautiful merging of of Christ with his people the mystery of Christ in us but you know we we have this Warfare that that we contend with and and that is that we live in this carnal kind of uh environment this this world of carnality and we live with this flesh we got to drag this guy around everywhere and yet the Bible tells us that we are living now we are now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so what do we do with this how do we how do we uh uh put these two together amen because uh you know as as we know that uh we've got to face this guy we've got to face our our reasonings our our mind we've got to we've got to deal with that and and yet as we heard last night God has given us another sense to contact him with amen and something that holds us something that keeps us it inspires us gives us the right Mo uh uh gives us the right strength the right faith for the moment that we living in and so there's this there's this interesting kind of a parallel existence and I want to just speak about this a little bit today and I trust it will just shine a light on how we live where we live amen and and how we deal with some of these issues that we face in our lives and also uh uh understanding who we are amen and and our position here in Christ that we have a purpose amen he did not just save us just so that we can clean our lives up and have a a nice little life here and and uh no he's got a purpose for you amen he and you'll find out today in the scriptures that he needs you he needs you the Lord Almighty needs you he needs your hands and uh I think that is uh it's hard to understand it's hard to really fully grasp but as we just take the scriptures we take what the prophet says you know he needs you and we need him and so so that is how we are complete amen if you'll just look at this verse here in in Luke 4 and6 it says and he came to Nazareth I love when the when the Holy Spirit begins to move when God you know he begins to move he's got a a purpose he's got a intention amen and I love to see what his motives are amen when he was coming to Nazareth this is the place of his birth and so on and and it was a kind of a not very well spoken of place you know it's just kind of a forgotten place you know not it was not the capital it was not anything special but he came to Nazareth and it says where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the Brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he stops there it's a period in my Bible now if you go back to the book of Isaiah it goes on but he knows where to stop he knows his portion in the word amen why don't we just bow our heads just for a moment Lord we thank you for the reading of your word we thank you for this opportunity to Stand Here Lord I just feel so inadequate Lord to to open this word that that is on my heart today but father I just want to get out of the way father I want to become so small in your presence this morning so that you can speak Lord and and that you can bring us strength you can bring us Faith encourage us in your word this morning as we open your word L God as we read Lord as as when you were reading the these words you knew your place in the in the scriptures you knew exactly the timing the placing Lord everything was so perfect father that's our desire today we want to see ourselves in your word today we want to see our placing we want to see our position and so Lord and we know that those things will give us courage for the for the journey that we face so we commit the reading of your word now Lord and we ask for your blessing we thank you for this service in Jesus Christ's name amen may have your seats for a moment well praise the Lord what a what an interesting uh set of scriptures that we read this morning as we could imagine what it would have been like that day in the in the synagogue a place of worship a place where it was normal for them to hand a scroll to somebody and he would read from it and it was encouraging and so forth but this day was a little bit different it was a little extra special and my brother and sister it's amazing how that when the Lord comes and and and you find eternity kind of uh mixing with with this time zone that we're in this this this life that we are in where everything is is is governed by time and we have a an eternal being who comes and he and he comes and it's like it's like all those things everything just starts to fit together you know the Wheels of Time and Eternity everything starts to connect and there's this harmony and and and here he comes and here's the word made flesh and he picks up the scroll that's handed to him amen now it wasn't a mistake that that scroll was handed to him the Lord knew exactly how this was going to play out amen he was just walking in the vision he he knew exactly who he was he had complete confidence and who he was amen and I believe that we as Believers we should have confidence in who we are we should not be afraid of the world out there we should not be afraid of the places we have to walk we should not be afraid of school or be afraid of work or or the challenges that we face because of who we are and here we find God walking in flesh literally and coming into his his synagogue the place that is dedicated to worship him it's amazing how that they in their religious system they were just con constantly missing what was happening constantly Off the Mark but here he comes he was not afraid of those things amen he was not afraid that they were missing him or that they were were rejecting him or that they were going to misunderstand him he came anyhow why because there was a people who would receive him there was a people who would understand the way that he understood when he read the scriptures so we find him he says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and on verse 21 he goes on and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears this should have pricked something something should have happened right here in the synagogue with all these people they should have realized something is happening and Lord open my eyes open my ears open my heart to receive what is taking place this is not a regular service you know why it was not a regular service because he was there he was there to fulfill his word he was there to to manifest who he is he was there to show that he knows what Isaiah wrote he was the Holy Spirit that inspired Isaiah to wrote those words because he knew he would be walking into the synagogue and he would be saying these things he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and I and I want to just clarify here it wasn't you know here is God Almighty wrapped in a in a robe of human flesh and we don't find that that that people were understanding who he was you know people did not recognize what was happening and yet he was saying very clearly and we can read it in in English today that this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears they it was clear it was plainly said it was said in public it was said in the place of worship where these things should come from and yet they did not hear what he was saying they could not understand what he was saying but nonetheless the word had to be said nonetheless these things had to be clarified it had to be done in front of witnesses it had to be done in front of an audience and to me it like if you can imagine God coming down and and he's going to pick up the scroll and he's going to read from his own book he's going to read what the prophet said about himself and look at the restraint that he has he could have said excuse me everybody pick up your notebooks and write this down he who is standing in front of you is the one who the scriptures is talking about you know he could have gone into great depth and great detail to explain what was happening but there was somebody there there's people there there's a people today who can read these same words and it has a different effect upon us why because we can see between the lines and it's not just that we intellectually can see between the lines I want to be very clear about what I'm saying here today we see ourself in the things that he is talking about amen we are identified because we read the same scriptures and we identify ourselves with the same word Hallelujah all right and he said verily I say this is verse 24 and he said verily I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country I mean it's it's so profound here the scriptures are being fulfilled the the the everything is being manifested everything's coming to life he is there personally to make sure the right things are read the right things are exposed and and unveiled and yet he he he kind of ends his sermon what a what a way to end a sermon Hey Brother Andrew it's not a high note it's not a high note it's kind of like here's a warning for you instead instead of us having a Revival here's a warning for you no Prophet is received no Prophet is received in his own country do you think that the prophet we have received would be received in his own country is already been spoken no Prophet is accepted in his own country so everything is playing out exactly according to scripture we shouldn't be surprised about the the way things are going in the United States amen we shouldn't be surprised about notice how I didn't say Canada but you know the well I just got to stay with the scriptures amen but you see what he's doing here he's clarifying don't be surprised this is how it is amen and these are characteristics these are the identifiers the markers so that we as Believers can see these things happening and it will just bring a rest and a peace this is what he has declared no Prophet is received in his own country and then goes in and it's amazing how how the Lord now he goes to bring Parables or or you know he always brings Parables he brings a story he brings something to illuminate what he's talking about and but in this case he doesn't bring Parables he doesn't bring you know a a story as as such you know this is like the kingdom of heaven or like this he's not trying to explain this he's just going to give you live examples he's going to give you factual events to clarify what he is talking about and these events should identify who he is and what is happening in their midst oh my this is where this is where to me it becomes so precious because he's now going to go back in history and he's going to pick up people people people who had nothing to do with fulfilling the word of God they had nothing to offer they had no resources amen they had no ability to bring these things to pass and yet he's going to go and use these people now to clarify what he's talking about what is the scene what is the what is the uh the Nugget what is the trying to unveil and yet he has veiled the whole truth of what he's talking about in these people's lives it's veiled in there so we have to go back to these stories we have to go back to these lives to pick it apart like a like a surgeon would to find out what is the the thing what is the mystery that he has veiled in these stories and not to be afraid even though the that no Prophet is accepted in his own country even though they rejected him in his own synagogue my brother and sister yet there is the stories that are there for our example today and we need to go see what he was talking about in verse 26 he's is he's just coming out of explaining how that there are many widows in the time of Elias or Elijah and so in verse 26 it says but unto none of them was Elijah sent save unto serepta a city of red on unto a woman that was a widow in other words there was many widows in the time of Elijah but only one of them received a prophet only one of them was a prophet uh sent unto this is interesting why why is he talking about this try and put yourself here's here's what we need to do this morning try and put yourself in the shoes of these people who are listening to Jesus talking what is he saying what has this got to do with what you just read what what is happening see these are all the he's giving us all the keys so that we can unlock the truths that are in these scriptures amen and so he didn't explain it all but he gives us the the road marks uh the road the markers right so we can go back oh he said something about Elijah and a widow woman we should go back and find out what happened in that story who's Elijah who's the Widow womanl and many he says in verse 27 and many lepers were in Israel in the time of elishah elisius the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving non the Syrian now he is he is now he's picked up on a gentile amen and they saying there was many lepers in the time of of of the story on the time of Elisha right which is another Prophet now so he's picked up on two prophets right catch this Elijah Elisha and in both stories there was there was only one person who would receive healing or Deliverance in Elijah's story there was there was one widow woman out of all the widows of that time in Elisha's story there was one leper out of all the lepers of that time who would be healed what is he trying to say he's not messing around he's not you know this is not just poetic license or bragging rights no he's being very clear about the the circumstances about a prophet being sent to a land to a time uh one Prophet being sent to a widow woman Prophet being sent to a a a king a king's um uh Captain right a king's Captain this is the Syrian this Gentile was the was the captain of of an army and so what is he talking about but he was the one leper that would be healed in a time of many lepers now some people would go wow what an what an unjust God what an unloving God The God Who Could heal the God who has power to do all things if we live in a silver spoon kind of a society where we expect everything to be handed to us and we start talking and the message ranks about a God who is Almighty and who can do anything whenever you can ask whatever you want and we kind of forget this this portion where we we we see what he's doing here in the scriptures that everything happens according to his will and so when we don't get a response when we don't get a healing or we don't get something that we're asking for right just asking for now I'm not talking about when the Lord has revealed something to you I'm talking about just in general just a a Prosperity Gospel when we don't get those things we become discouraged and we are we start to doubt and we start to disbelieve or reason my brother and sister what is he trying to show us here that everything works according to his will for a plan for a purpose and he sees you he knows about you he knows everything that's going on in your life even brother brandom look at this man who who had healing camp pains he had had had great demonstrations of Miracles and and discernment and all these things and yet he himself was sick to the end of his ministry why was that because God had a mystery in his life it was there for a reason Paul was was buffeted over and over and it was there for a reason it was so that it would harness the amount of Revelation he would have amen it was there for a reason the things that are happening in your life are very carefully very carefully planned out you might say but what a cruel God we have I've had this happen in my life I've Lo lost a loved one or my my son or my daughter's not serving God or whatever the thing may be today or I have a sickness God knows about those things he's in control of your life everything works together for our good amen so it's about trusting in the Lord and and this is really what what he's coming to represent to us that he is in control that his will will play out I mean can you imagine in the day of of widows you can just imagine Elijah making his way to the woman of zerath right that little widow woman and it's you know he couldn't he couldn't go to any other Widow and this is a time of drought a time of of need a time of of great distress no doubt there was many widows and here he is making his way he's the prophet everybody knows who align is here he is walking down the street you can imagine how many widows would have invited him would have liked for him to come into their home and yet he's walking down the street why because something I don't want to get ahead of myself but something was inside of him that was connected to a widow woman that was waiting in a in a in a in her yard was waiting in the front yard amen and she was she was it was her last day her conditions were dire but something connected him to that widow woman and those two were connected to God and the story I mean it had to play out exactly because Jesus Christ was going to stand in the synagogue one day and he was going to use this example can you imagine how God uh orchestrated the the prophet's footsteps to make sure that he makes it to that one widow woman no other widow woman would receive him into his home the same with a leper and then then we say well God is so cruel he could have done all this he could have healed all the all the lepers he could have no he's got a plan he's got a purpose and for us is to have confidence and to be able to trust in his plan amen we we want to be stable in our walk with the Lord our faith should be anchored on something solid it should be anchored on on something that is eternal amen because you know nothing that is is formed against us can prosper oh my I better get back to my notes okay now we have we have we have two accounts two very very opposing kind of stories very opposites and I believe it's because the Lord is trying to uh cover all all the grounds right so we have a widow woman who is headless she does not have a head right in in her life she has lost her head her husband who is her provider so she is without provision right so she is alone she does not have the means to to look after herself financially and so this is this is amazing because remember the Lord said to Elijah he says I have chosen I have commanded I have picked out I have commanded a widow woman to sustain you a widow woman now in our churches uh brother Ben correct me if I'm wrong but in our churches we you know the the Lord has instituted he has he has he has given us offices to look after widow woman amen the deacons right that we have offices in the church we have we have the resources the the the church looks after the Widow wom amen maybe we just do that in Canada but we look after the widow woman it's our privilege it's our the the Lord blesses the church so that we can in turn bless and look after the widows that have lost their their means to provide fors amen and so that is a privilege that we have as a church it's a strength coming from the church through the church through the Deacon board looking after the widows and that's such a blessed thing to have but but now he's saying I have ch I have commanded a widow woman to sustain you it's the opposite way around now a woman that does not have the resources a woman who is supposed to be receiving resources who's who who has no strength of her own she cannot give anything she has nothing to offer she does not have a husband she doesn't have anything uh uh going for her if we can say it like that but he chooses this type of a woman who was nothing who had nothing but he chooses her he says I have past tense commanded a widow woman to sustain you the prophet wait I I thought it was the prophets sustaining the bride oh what's he saying what's he talking about I I thought the the the ministry was there to sustain and it was supposed to flow down to the widows but in this case he's saying this widow woman who has no resources has no abilities is going going to sustain the profit of the day oh who are you anyway amen who are you what does God what does God see in your life you might say brother Chris I have nothing my life is a mess I am down to my last meal H I've come to this Camp it's it's I'm giving God one more chance I'm giving him one more shot I I've I've reached the end of my my strength oh you're perfect you're absolutely perfect because do you think God made a mistake when he chose her he needed her to be exactly in that condition he allowed things to happen in her life I know this is going to sound cruel but he allowed things to happen in her life where she did not understand why God would take her husband in such a time of of a drought and the things that are happening in the land lord why would you take take my husband from me he was moving her closer into the word he was putting her right in the right position the right condition so that he can use her he needed her in that condition in other words in her flesh God would bring Glory unto himself out of her weakness he would bring Glory there would be a the right thing it would be the right sound coming out of her life and it would have such a Rippling effect through eternity that that widow woman would be talked about would be the would be the the signpost in that synagogue that day when he was changing from Jewish dispensation to Gentile dispensation and he was bringing out what was happening that no prophets would be received no Prophet would be received in his own country and then he uses that widow woman out of all the stories he could have talked about David he could have talked about Moses he could have used the prophets of old he could have used all these people but he used the widow woman you think it was a mistake that she ended up in the condition she was in but do you let me just remind you my brother and sister God allowed her to come to that place he orchestrated her life the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord plain and simple he allowed her to come to that place he knew the tears she she cried over her husband he knew the the suffering she went through but he was there all the time she might have felt alone she might have felt like God doesn't hear me God we're supposed to receive a prophet we're supposed to receive Deliverance where is the god of Israel he was there all the time he was orchestrating governments he allowed the he allowed the the the the Jezebel to to uh to put pressure on the prophet amen he allowed all these things to happen I want to say something so he didn't really need the widow woman in this light let me say it like this he just the Elijah the prophet was just being fed right he was in he was in this nice Oasis he had just run away from Jezebel the Lord picks him up what are you doing here right and he puts him in this nice Oasis and he has Ravens feeding him I mean what is he trying to say I can do anything the way I choose to feed you is my choosing the way I choose to take care of you is my choosing I I am God Amen I created all things right all things were created by Him and catch this next portion for him everything was made for him those r Ravens were made for him to use to feed the prophet amen that Prophet was made for him everything that we see my brother and sister the people you see here in this room today are made for God your life was made for God everything about you is for God so he cares about your life but what am I saying here he is he's he's he's got him in this perfect scenario this perfect condition he's already feeding him he's he's got this nice Rippling Brook that comes by and the Cool Breeze and it's so lovely and and so nice and then God shows up and stops up the water and stops the Ravens uh by the way I have a widow a woman for you I I I believe the Lord fed him with Ravens and had that little riing book there by chth right I believe he had those things to prove to us he didn't need the widow woman right he can do whatever he wants but there was a purpose there was a reason that he needed the widow woman it wouldn't be a a bird from the sky it would be a woman who is in this flesh who is dealing with weaknesses and reasonings and doubts and fears he chose a widow woman to do the same thing that he can do in the Supernatural she's as good as those Ravens but now he said I have commanded her that's what he said oh my I love the scriptures huh he said I have commanded her have past tense I've commanded this wiow woman to sustain you Elijah where in the scriptures do we find God talking to the widow woman if anybody knows of a place please let me know because I have looked there's nowhere in the scripture right where God speaks to the widow woman and commands her tells her to feed Elijah to sustain Elijah that's a pretty big deal right this is like life life changing this is life altering this is this is going into the supernatural realm you would think that you know in a business if there was a big move taking place or or you know you're going to change policies or something you have a meeting and everybody gets the memo right and it's well explained well laid out there's something about the way God operates that he does not need to send us memos and he does not have to explain everything to us why because there's something in US that is him that knows what to do at the right time this bride will know what to do with the word amen the prophet said it she'll know what to do with the word now the prophet never explained to us what that means what word there's something in us it's pre-written it's written in the fleshly tables of our hearts we might not have heard an audible voice we're like that Rahab amen we might not have have heard an audible voice we might not have been there in the healing lines we might not have been there when he was preaching those things but yet nonetheless there's something in us that causes us to press on causes us to believe like we heard last night causes us to press through and we can't explain it I can't explain why why some leave the message and some stay but it does cause me to go back to the scriptures and find out where do these things happen oh my she was commanded which means ordered it was it was like a a commission and yet there was no record of God speaking to her that we know of we're going to see that record one day because it's all written in eternity her whole life was mapped out by God the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and he told Elijah the prophet he said go to her because I have commanded her I have commanded her and here when we if we could just turn the camera over to this widow woman as God is speaking the widow woman is over here in her front yard digging through the the the dust she's picking up two sticks you know what the prophet says you know he says those two sticks represents the cross we know that part so well what we don't always read is that he says those two sticks used to be a big tree she comes out into her yard and there with that nice big tree maybe it was a fruit tree maybe it was a tree that used to give shelter maybe maybe it it would bring a nice shade in the in the hot summer days and you know there was a a tree there was a nice big tree in her yard but conditions had gone so bad that there was two little sticks left over from this tree I mean you tell me how bad conditions have to get where a tree would perish and it would become two little sticks so it was bad and she was she was there in her yard she's thinking about her son she's making she's going to make a little fire she's got just enough food she's been rationing I can just see her maybe 30 days ago she was planning this day she knew that I've got about 30 pieces of of meal left I've got about 30 days worth of oil left I've got just enough and I cannot see past that why because we have been given a number of days to live she could not see past those number of days what is the mystery beyond that there's does my life end is this really what it's all about am I going to reach the end of my existence and that's just it's all over it's done I have commanded a w a woman that's ringing out in eternities and that that word is going to find that woman but here I want to show you the carnal the carnal environment that she's in the carnal atmosphere that she finds herself in is a one of of dreariness of weariness of tiredness just this day in day out just watching carefully over those little bits of meal and and protecting it and and watching over it and making sure that that nobody comes in to steal it you know she's just and then she's wondering what is God going to do and what are the number of my days and and looking after all these things and day and day out going to church in the synagogues looking for something real right and here she comes and and in the meantime there's a prophecy hanging over her head there's a a virtue there's a a resilience there's a strength that she has not tapped into yet but God has already spoken God chose her and she might not have heard she might not have known she cannot explain that but she's just going through her everyday existence and it was miserable at best until one day she's in a in her front yard huh now I want to ask you a question how did how did Elijah know which widow woman it would be CU it had to be that one the one with the two sticks the one with the last morsal of meal he could have picked a better one just to increase his odds right he could have maybe somebody who was wealthy he could have chosen a wealthy W widow woman but he didn't he came to this one and the Bible clearly lays out how poor and how fragile her existence was without God's word without God's vision of her without God in her uh uh plan and without God in her life my brother and sister she would have perished like all or maybe like some of the Widow women but she had a promise so the prophet comes to her house how did he get there how did he you know that's why I love the uh the the Insight the prophet brings in our day how did how did he know where this wiow woman was you know she didn't have a sign up on her door uh if any Prophet is passing by here specifically by the name of Elijah God told me that I'm going to sustain you that's not how this worked she had no idea and Elijah he was just said he was just told a certain city a certain location there's a widow woman there that will sustain you does not give the name okay so how did he know brother brandham tells us that he saw her in a vision in other words there there's this parallel kind of existence and this is to me what is so important that there's a written portion of your life the mystery of your life is hanging over top of you all the time we hear from our theophany amen our theophany is what tells us what kind of Faith to have and what to say and and and it's the Deep calling to a deep there's something that is just right here there's a like another existence I I don't know how to explain it so just bear with me but there's a truth about you that is playing out at the exact same time am there's a vision of you amen there's there's a portion of of you that is already pre-written God's plan for your life predestinated Justified Sanctified glorified right right it's fixed the destination is fixed everything is playing out and yet we are in this carnal side also where we we have been given a body we've been given this body to do what it has a purpose to contact this Dimension and it does a great job we've been fearfully wonderfully made and it's been made to contact and everything we see around us wherever we go my brother and sister whatever it is whether it be a tree whether it be a mountain whether it be your mother at home whatever it is all the visible things declare the invisible and then he gives us another sense like we heard last night called the faith sense to contact the other world because it's more real it's fixed it's pre-written do you know uh we are now living in Heavenly places right now right even though we are sitting in this building we are actually in another atmosphere we are eagles amen and Eagles are designed to do what change from one dwelling place to another specifically higher they are they are given the strength the power to go and change their Dwelling Place amen so we've been given the strength to change our dwelling place we while we are pilgrims and strangers in this world Paul said you know the life I now live is not my own he recognized something something else is playing out in his life the life I'm living the life I that I'm uh uh the the things I do the the places I go it's not just me doing these things but it is Christ who lives in me he recognized something else is holding him something else is keeping him when he should have fallen something picked him up when he should have made him mistake there was something to lift him up amen I'm so way off my notes forgive me but we we're kind of in this dual kind of existence and we get to choose which one we want to emphasize you can choose the fear you can choose the doubt or you can choose what he has done for you you can choose who you are in Christ that we are now in Heavenly places you know when you go to work you know the next day you go to work I'm not sure if that's Monday Tuesday whichever day it is but if when you go to work again you're not just going to work but all of Heaven is around you there's the supernatural realm is all around you and my question to you is what testimony has he commanded from you take a an afternoon and go pray about that what testimony has he commanded from your life brother Chris I haven't heard a word from God neither did this with a woman but it did not matter because he has already spoken regarding her it's already as good as done what testimony has he commanded from you because it will come to pass you'll get to Monday and and you might feel you might feel what am I doing at work I got to deal with these people I got to do this no there's something about you he's watching you he's making sure you're going to be in the right position at the right at the right time why because you are the sustaining element to his word that's a little heavy it's a little heavy but we sustain the word what is it he said I'm just telling you what the scripture says amen it's I know it's hard for me also to grasp but but think about that you are the sustaining portion to the prophet what good is the prophet who has the secrets of God's heart has the has the Mysteries that are going to come through him if there's not a person to reveal it to if there's not a p if he's bringing a message to connect you to God right now we could we could play this game of of looking at at the story of the widow woman and we could say well who's sustaining who because God said I have commanded a wow woman to sustain you right so here's a wiow woman she's is going to have the ability to do the right thing to say the right thing react the right way respond the right way she's going to have the ability to sustain the prophet based on the word of God right but then the prophet has to be the one that's on the scene he has to be there to make that contact because he's the revealer of the secrets of God she was a secret in that land of widows there was a secret concerning her she was the chosen one to sustain the pro so we have the Prophet come on the scene and yet it's God who has orchestrated all this he's the one who said I commanded so who's sustaining who it's all connected amen I mean you could argue it all three ways it is it is beautiful how it's how God writes his word how he how he plans it out we like I said it's hard to figure out where the lines are Where's the Line begin where the widow woman is actually the one sustaining isn't it God who said she would do that isn't it the power of his word through her that is causing her the ability to sustain but then without her God wouldn't be able to sustain Elijah do you see what I'm saying so we are so intricately intertwined in God's plan in his mind and each and every one of you have such an important part to play you might say well I'm just surviving yeah so was she she was so was she I'm not a Preacher Brother Chris I'm not I'm not anybody important so was she she doesn't even have a name but you can put your name there today commanded her to sustain you she was living in another atmosphere I find it amazing how this woman reacted to the to the prophet she you know it's it's amazing when you when you see a um a son or daughter of God the way they respond to situations is there's something about her character right there's something about her she she goes beyond the normal and yet she it wasn't explained to her this is to me such a comfort because the whole message wasn't explained to her but she was already designed she was already created in such a way to receive the word she would respond the right way in her flesh in this carnal thing she would respond the right way there's something in us that that holds us in our times of trial and distress when we want to break you know that last that last little step right where you feel like I'm going to break this it's too much it's when you hear that voice is when somebody comes on the scene somebody sends you a text the Lord knows exactly where those limits are so he comes to her we know the story well I I might as well finish the story of the widow woman he comes to her and he asks for her to give him water now there a time of drought right it's a time of drought but it's it's amazing you know water is something that that is is not it's not very um kind of like it's just kind of like everybody has this you know water is something that everybody would have access to you know in a time of in a time of droughts and famines and stuff the major thing that they pump into those places is water right they make sure everybody has water it's the last resource it's the most important thing right so he asks something of her that is that is something that she could give she doesn't we don't see her uh thinking about it we don't see her uh you know being negative we don't see her kind of like uh worried or anything like that she just turns and gets goes to get the water right she just responds right away that's something I can do absolutely that's something I have right so I'm going to give you that and then and then and and at this point it hasn't it's not really affecting her and her son so what he's asking of her this is still easy you know he's a gentleman he's he's just slowly breaking in because he's already seen the vision this Prophet knows the SEC secret about this woman right he's not afraid to ask her you know because that would be a cruel thing to go into somebody's home in a season of drought and uh just can you please give me your food who here in their right mind would do that um I am a provider for my house my family you know I'm going to defend my resources something else was happening There's Something About This widow woman that was pre-written right that would react not like the other widow woman would have reacted they would have acted reacted very differently but she reacts the right way according to what was in the mind of God so she goes to get the water and then he says oh can you can you first go and and and bake me a cake right and we see through this dialogue it gets harder and harder what he asks her to do becomes harder and harder so much so that now he he he asks and he says say bake me a cake first I mean it's not like you know like just bring me some meal or some water it'll be that'll suffice you know I've been fed from Ravens for the last you know so many days weeks and and I mean I'm feeling pretty good but please bring me some water and now bring me a uh some meal and now just while you're at it just bake me a cake first first so everything she had everything all her resources she had to give it to the prophet first and you might say well that is everything well so was the little Loaves and Fishes it was all he had but in the right hands you see what I'm saying in the right hands there's a supernatural atmosphere also there's a supernatural God that is on the scene that has pre-written the story and he knows how it's going to play out and he's going to bring the virtue the strength the faith he's going to bring all the right ingredients he's going to bring us sweep over the bride amen how are we going to go into a Rapture well it's pre-written it's been it's already played out amen the vision we've seen the vision the prophet has shown us the vision that he saw the bride marching into the Rapture amen but there comes a season when all these things come together and he brings the supernatural elements all we have to do is keep moving forward keep believing keep trusting and so what is what does he do he he says bring me a cake first I I think it's just perfect a cake right in in my head I'm thinking a nice cake you know it's bring me something nice something amazing something refreshing right and at this point she turns and she says if I do this my son and I will die she now she now lays out the predicament she's in right and he said nonetheless go go do this to me this is this is so important what would we do well we know what we would do if we're in Christ amen by faith but what would we do you know when hardships come our way or somebody doesn't treat us the right way or or there's trouble in the church we want to react so quickly it is it is so much better to just find a quiet space give yourself a week give yourself a month give yourself some time and say Lord what is your will that is playing out in this what is what is what does the the writing say what do the Scrolls say about what I'm supposed to do here because I don't want to just react from a carnal position I don't want to react from a carnal atmosphere but I want to be in the heavenlies and and if I if I can just see that I'm in your will then it doesn't matter what happens it'll play out exactly according to your will and I want to be what you've written of me because it will have an eternal effect it'll have long lasting effects but if you take control and say I'm going to manage this I'm going to take care of this I'm going to deal with this I'm GNA fix this you'll make a mess just look at Jonathan and and Saul on the hill to me that is such a beautiful beautiful scene and it should be a scene that we um remember that we keep in the forefronts of our minds there's something about Jonathan the quality in Jonathan the Integrity of Jonathan and Jonathan they they we know the story they go up on that hill this is the this is a losing side that the whole battle is turned against them they are they're going to be defeated and and yet we find Jonathan and soul dying together so much so that David we know who David is amen he he looks at this scene and and he said but he says in the end they were not divided there something that he saw and this picture now and like I say it's easy to say that but you've got to really pay attention to who's lying on the hill there is Saul who's been rejected by God because there's a change of administration coming amen he's just he has not discarded him but he has he has ended his administration and because we know Saul will be there that day amen and so but Jonathan now Jonathan look at who Jonathan is he's supposed to be the prince who's going to be king in his father's stead but this poor man you know he's been so mistreated he's been made fun of by his own father he's been ridiculed in front of his men by his own father and yet Jonathan recognizes that God has chosen David but he doesn't go against his father this to me it it it goes beyond carnal abilities goes beyond carnal things and and the things we would we would do in Jonathan's position my church is this way and my pastor is that way or my mom and dad is a certain way so I'm going to go against them I'm going to fix this because they are wrong my brother and sister it's amazing how how Jonathan managed to keep his Integrity in the face of confusion in the face of ridicule in the face of of misunderstandings he managed to stay in the place that God called him to stay what about you as the bride of Christ when things get hard things go rough and we go through hard times in our churches and there's divisions and there's hard feelings but what about you what are you going to do in the time like that are you going to stand in your position and have some Integrity or you going to take things into your own hands my brother and sisters a important thing and it and it really for me the the lesson to learn from Jonathan is is where was he living where was Jonathan living was he living on that Hill next to his father with all the the shame and the failures and the things falling apart what looked like was falling apart was he was he looking at those things or was he looking at what God was going to do through David the purpose of God's plan for his life was he looking at a promise that he made in secret with David that if I oh if you become king he knew he was going to become king he was literally going to take his place the place that he should have had the that kingship belonged to Jonathan Jonathan would have had the resources the ability to defend his family he would have had been able to fight but it was not not God's will for Jonathan God's will for Jonathan was to die next to his father and yet David can look at that scene and say in the end they were not divided I think that picture is so much bigger than just two Eagles dying on a hill but it was foretelling Christ on a cross the the whole story had Rippling effects God looking at JN an and he and there's the father who who has rejected him even and Jonathan dying next to him because that was his place he needed to be at his post of Duty in the face of confusion in the face of all these things he had to be a man of integrity a man who was walking alone with God it was not about the morals of the world it was not about the conditions around him it was about his calling it was about his place in the body of Christ but there was a secret Covenant between him and David there was a another thing that was happening there was something that has been pre-written that if I die David will you look after my family his death on that Hill bought his son a seat at the king's table you know and I wonder if we the way we react the way we respond if we buy a seat at the king's table with the way we act the way we respond to things the way we conduct our lives are we purchasing a seat at the table for our children people might not understand why you act a certain way they might reject you they might they might think you're a failure they might think you're this or that or why do you believe in a prophet they can say all manner of things but in the secret of our hearts we maintain our integrity we maintain our trust in the Lord we stay in our position why because there's a seat being purchased you know that's the purpose of the Bride right that's why there's the story of Esther that's why there the story of Ruth that's why there's a story of all the women that go through the scriptures it's about you standing in your place so that you can speak on behalf of your family but if you're not in your position how will you speak but see if we allow fear and carnality to overcome us that's exactly what the devil wants amen if we allow those things to overcome us it will distort our Behavior it'll be confusing our children will look and they won't understand right we have to maintain our position press on press forward keep believing keep trusting in the Lord there's a story written the the plan is you know it's so it's so important so much so that when the disciples came back to Jesus they did great Miracles they did great things in his name even Judas was there they did great things in his name because there is a there's a law that is attached to Faith amen it there's a law that if you believe these things will happen there's a law but that people can operate in those Realms but there was another realm Jesus was going to unveil and he says don't Rejoice just because demons are subject unto you don't just Rejoice because healings are taking place don't just Rejoice because of the signs Rejoice because of who you are Rejoice because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life it is written in him it's written in him I not sure why we went this direction this morning but you are so important in God's eyes you are so necessary and the things we go through in our lives my brother and sister they are necessary we don't we don't have to be afraid of them we don't have to worry about them we don't have to get anxious about them many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of them all so much so that he would pick up the widow woman story many hundreds of years later and why why does he do that maybe I should just shine a little bit of light on this before we close why does he do this why what is the connection between these stories he he's talking about a widow woman who had no resources and then he flips it around and he says and what about non who had resources but his resources could not help him either so even his resources in the carnal world he had position he had stature he had an army you could command he had military grade doctors and yet in all these things nobody could heal him he he was a commander of armies he was a man of position don't miss that he was an important man so on one side of the scale we have someone with no resources on the other side we have someone with resources that's that's not what it's about it's not about your position and status in this carnal realm it's about your positioning in Christ it's about the vision of the word that has been pre-written of you Hallelujah in non's story we also find a little lady oh it's so beautiful huh a little lady God needed a little lady whose country had to be invaded had to be attacked her parents destroyed in front of her she would have been U taken hostage we've seen what happened on October 7th the the the feelings the hatred the the atrocity the tragedy this is how they feel we just had uh two people from Israel staying in our home and and they're like ambassadors for Israel they the emissaries they want to awaken people to what's happening in Israel we had them staying in our home we got firsthand accounts of how this feels and what's going on and so we can see how these how these tragedies how they can affect us carnally carnally right but where are you living so this little girl where was she living really was she living in the Syrian Captain's home the enemy to her people this was not a nice story this is we we've got to get the little Sunday school story like idea out of our head this this was a a terrible time for Israelites it was an embarrassing time for Israelites it was she was in this home where where where she was literally forced to serve the the enemy of her people probably the man who orchestrated the demise of her family and she had to serve this man she had to she had to look after his wife and tend to her needs in the very House of her enemies now she was living in a carnal realm we can imagine she could have taken advantage of the situation she could have said oh I'm in his home and I'm close enough to him where maybe I could poison his food or I could bring demise to his house you see if she was living in a carnal environment this is where her mind would be Revenge hatred and what woe is me and where is the god of my people she could have been like this but she was not in despair we don't find this little girl moving around and discouraged but yet she is she is focused and she's patient she was a lady of Integrity even though she was done wrong too amen oh Lord help us have patience huh Lord help us have patience to let the scene evolve let the story play out but she was not living in a carnal environment she was not looking at the conditions around her she was not looking at the place she was living cuz she was living in another realm I believe that with all my heart because there's no way possible for someone to live in that environment and and do what she did so we find her in this home she is in the in this Captain's home and and you know what's amazing is is if she found out about the leprosy if she found out about this right that he was a leer it's she could use this to her Advantage I found the weak spot right I found a rumor I heard a rumor he he's got a sense he's got a secret something and start to spread that throughout the kingdom to for her Advantage right for her personal Advantage for Israel's Advantage I have found a secret I can I can use us to exploit him to to blackmail him I could you know she's she could have she could have really done some damage in Syria she could have but we don't find her doing this there's a bigger story playing out because Jesus was going to stand in the temple one day and use that man but remember behind that man was a woman who was living in the right kind of atmosphere right if you really go study the story out what what would cause that woman to direct the enemy of Israel to her Prophet who has the answer for his need right what would make a little girl right we saw some little girls singing on the platform this morning what would cause a little girl to have that kind of knowledge remember now the key is in what Jesus said no leper was healed so it's not like this little girl could sit around and go well the prophet healed this leper and he said if you say it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or if you lay hands on on the sick you shall recover there was none of this no leper was healed this is very important there was no there was no example right and yet her conditions are so dire so bad for her to do completely the opposite right how did she know if you if you answer that question you'll see where I'm going the Lord would have had to tell her in some un audible way would have had to tell her or show her by Vision this is how he's going to be healed how else would this little girl know to say oh if you were with the prophet in Samaria that's pretty specific for him to be with the prophet that that is in Samaria how does she know he was in Samaria how did he know that there was a pro how did she know there was a prophet there remember she was taken out from that land right how did she know these things and how did she know you would be healed uh can you give me one example right of where a leper's been healed this way give me 10 examples one examp one example would suffice but the Bible says no lepers amen right and in the Widow story it is no widows very interesting I've got you on the edge of your seats maybe we'll leave it till next year what is he saying what is he trying to tell us so I think he explains it in his own life the of Bethesda Jesus Christ walks on the scene into a place where there's many that needs healing many and he the prophet explains it like this he would step over the bodies he would walk past why because something was pre-written I do nothing Jesus said I do nothing unless the father reveals it to me first I'm just trying to shine a little light into what's in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world like you cannot fail and even though people would have looked at him and said you should be doing this you should have done this you should heal this person this person's need was greater than that person there's always going to be voices trying to manipulate you trying to control you it's always going to be somebody trying to influence you for their benefit always it's that's just going to be part of our carnal existence and it's not all bad I'm not saying it's all bad some people are trying to encourage you trying there's count there's good there's count in the Council of many right there's there's good things also but the the key is is to be completely surrendered to the will of God so we find here Jesus Christ walking through the pul of Bethesda right and in and in every story we find water there's a connection between all these stories right the woman gave Elijah Water right and non had to go dip himself seven times in water and now here is Jesus Christ in the pool of Bethesda right it's the Waterway through the Waterway right we are baptized into a Heavenly Kingdom we are baptized into the body of Christ into Heavenly places amen so what does he say he he comes in he comes into the scene of the pool of Bethesda and he literally walks over to the one man one man and there's there's some beautiful language in the scripture here the Bible says that the Lord knew that he had been there many days how did he know he Prophet explains this to us he says he was walking according to the vision so we have the unwritten part right the unwritten the Unseen we have the scene we have celestial bodies we have terrestrial bodies and they all have their own glory amen that's what the scripture says but all things were created by Him for him so that we could recognize the Unseen things by the seen things amen so do you see what's happening so you've got these two things and and and the one are one is pointing at the other right it's a deep calling to a deep it's the the mystery of you right but we have this un this this unspoken this written part that is unspoken that we don't hear there's not an audible voice that we hear but it is fixed it's written amen it's written that's that's the the bride will know what to do with the word it's pre-written we we have a story concerning us we will go through a body change there will be a resurrection will be all these things it's pre-written Amen and your individ ual walks with the Lord are all also pre-written so we have this this heavenly realm that is the real you that is playing out amen if I could have like a screen today and it it would actually just mimic me just copy me exactly you know like if you put on your computer screen and you want to project it to another screen you can choose you can say I want to duplicate screen or extend it right and so but if you duplicate it then the the what you see here here on on in one form is exactly the same in that form over there right it might be a larger screen but it's the same picture right it's playing out exactly the same we are so connected to God to what he has thought of you to his plan you you cannot there's there's nothing if God before us who can be against us what can separate us from the love of God like like these are not poetic statements these are literal statements you cannot I he said I will lose none of mine all the father has given me will come to me will did anybody hear that Audible Voice but it's written and you are right now playing out the image of the invisible you are playing out right here and and and what I'm trying to say today and I'll close with this Jesus went to the pilipi esda he went to one man the the whole point of all this is even though the prophet is not received in his own country even though he was rejected in his synagogue do you know that that after this great preaching and and him picking out just the right scriptures because he knew a prophet would pick up these things later you know that all this this great Supernatural event the the the whole culmination of this was it's such a sad ending if you think about it but it says that there was not many miracles done because of their unbelief right this is the conditions but the point of the whole story is even though the conditions look so bad even though it looks like the vision terries even though it looks like it's it's about failure like Jonathan and Saul Jonathan and Saul is a great victory for MTH you just go ask him and and did they ever lose each other no they'll be reconnected again one day cuz there's another seat at another table because somebody else died that looked like a terrible condition but nothing could keep him in the grave why because it was pre-written I am the resurrection and the life if you put this body in the ground I will raise it up again if you destroy this Temple I will raise it up again you think he's going to fail no there wasn't a demon in hell that could keep him there there wasn't a Roman seal that could keep him in the grave because it was pre-written it was spoken you think those words will come back to him void what about your life the part that you are playing you will return to him but there's a story playing out in different layers and that's why the prophet says it's a theophany right that's calling unto us our theophany knows who we really are it's a deep calling to a deep I'm closing the musicians can come it's a deep calling to a deep there's a connection and in our in our daily walks really what is it what am I saying this morning I'm saying we see a lot with these carnal eyes but we don't live here we don't really live here right we don't live in these conditions to live here would mean that these conditions have an effect upon us that they influence us that they control us we don't live here we are strangers and pilgrims in a Strange Land seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God where is that City Abraham I don't know but I'm walking I feel it pulling it's my theophany calling me as a deep calling to a deep there's a mystery about my life I don't understand it and yet we find Abraham is is such an amazing Story how that God brings him all the way to this place where he stands right in front of God and he's asking for his family making intercession for his family we see this in Moses we see this in Jesus Christ himself we see this in Esther this is our role this is our purpose our story but look at the conditions of Abraham's life to get him to that place living in a different atmosphere we are living in a different atmosphere in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus brother Isaac if you'll close in a song God bless you I'm looking forward to the service tonight amen let's Stand Together Jesus walked into the pool of Bethesda and the Bible says that I knew he says Jesus saying I knew you have been here for many days whatever you're going through whatever part of life you're in just keep those words in the in the in in your mind he knows all the days he knew how many days he'd been laying there you know isn't it amazing while Jesus is doing all these other things and mirales and doing great feats in the back of his in the background there's a story playing out in this man's life in Beth in in Betha the PO of be Bethesda sorry this this man is is living out in agony and every day there every time this this the angel would move the waters trouble the waters somebody would push him out of the way or he would just be just too slow or you know it it just just didn't couldn't seem to get there there was something holding him back it was the word it wasn't see this is this is where we got to change our thinking it wasn't Calamity that's holding you back it's not your inabilities holding you back there's a promise God wants to come on the scene himself personally to you because he knows who you are and he knows where you are and he wants to come personally and deliver you from that thing but sometimes we will blame our conditions we will blame our church we will blame this no it's actually God oh man there's a you say God will allow evil to befall me is it evil when he says all things work together for good he puts bits in the mouth of trouble he controls it he tells her which way to turn amen nothing can happen to you unless he allows it no one can take your life oh my do we see who we are the devil can't touch you and everything that's happening to you is happening for a reason but for us in this we we we kind of approach life with a carnal understanding with with carnality and we try to understand it through carnal uh abilities and it's going to be miserable it'll be wearisome it'll be tires it it's it's not how we do things we do we do not walk by sight we walk by faith so whatever we're going through whatever you're going through you can you can you can just take a step back and say Lord I might not be able to get through those Waters but I know that every day I try you count it every day I rush and somebody pushes me aside every day I get up and I deal with this thing every day that I pray for my family every day that I I know that you are right there you are with me you are there in the room when I'm crying you are there when I'm lonely you are there in my school and my workplaces you are there every time I reach you are there but my brother and sister you can have faith in him Lord I know there'll come a day it'll be a certain day it will it will have run out the the the time that you have allotted for it and you hold all that you know he created time why would he create time he's a he's a being of Eternity why would he create time time wasn't made for us okay time was not made for us all things we got to stick to the scriptures amen all things were made by him for him so time was made for him so we're not behind we're not in a rush we're not it's all for him time is in his hands he's in control of the time he knows how many days he knows how many hours he knows this very [Music] moment he created time because he knew that there would come a day be it 39 days be it 39 months whatever the time sequence is the sixth hour the seventh day all the all the all those numbers in the Bible are to prove that he is the Divine architect it's so that we can measure him so that we can see how perfect on time God is every time and that we don't fail all things were created by Him for him your life my brother and sister is such a beautiful Symphony playing out to your savior he looked looks at your life and he says just hang on just one more day one more day I'm coming you are playing your part perfectly one more day remember Nebuchadnezzar without God he was just an animal he was just a beast even in the government world even out there as a king this enemy of Israel even he was controlled by God was made for god without God we're just a beast in the field an unrecognizable beast but here everything is playing out perfectly when he came to the pool of Bethesda he proved that he is God and he proved that that man belonged to him that he was his that he knew about him that to me is the most beautiful thing the Lord knows those who are his the whole point of the story is that the Lord knew there was a widow woman the Lord knew that there was a leper and the Lord knew that there was this man who was impotent man he knows about you but he also knows know the rest of your story so this today we can trust in him amen God bless you brother Isaac you'll sing a few songs brother Ben amen oh yes we're looking for a city oh we will never die [Applause] there the SAT will never s goodby there will meet our savior and th L ones to come now Holy Spirit

righteous are ordered of the Lord sometimes those footsteps take us to through many dark places but they're ordered of the Lord you think you you think about Esther she became Queen all the things God
