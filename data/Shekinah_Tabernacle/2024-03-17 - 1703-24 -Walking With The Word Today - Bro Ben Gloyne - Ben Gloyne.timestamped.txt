[36:50] 365 years and Enoch walked with God and
[36:54] he was not for God took him so obviously

[36:59] doing his own thing and then God

[37:03] him and then we're just going to read

[39:25] as well into your hands in Jesus
[39:27] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[39:30] friends you can have your seats this
[39:31] morning so I want to speak about and and
[39:33] I will get to gibian nights but you see
[39:35] that you know there's a there's a time
[39:37] here we can read here where Enoch walked
[39:39] with God now we know that Enoch was the
[39:41] seventh from Adam so he was he was a
[39:44] shadow of those in the seventh Church
[39:46] age that will walk with God and will be
[39:47] taken will be not they'll go into a
[39:49] Rapture so he was a shadow of of of us
[39:52] speaking about us in this end time now
[39:55] so Enoch walked with the word now you
[39:57] have to there's a great challenge uh
[39:59] really in every age but in particularly
[40:01] this age where every Divine promise of
[40:04] God has been opened up to us amen where
[40:07] there's not one thing in God's word that
[40:09] has been sealed up saying it's not the
[40:11] season for it but we know that when the
[40:13] mighty Angel descended in Revelations
[40:15] chapter 10 with an open book it wasn't a
[40:17] partially open book it was a completely
[40:19] open book so so the promises of God have
[40:21] been unveiled or unsealed to us in this
[40:24] time because brother Braham would say
[40:26] that the opening of those seal reveals
[40:28] Christ if you just see horse riders look
[40:30] again if you just see tribulation look
[40:32] again because it's the lamb stepping
[40:34] forth I remember the first time I heard
[40:36] the seals I saw horse riders I saw
[40:37] tribulation I saw the Jews and the two
[40:39] witnesses all these things but the next
[40:41] time I heard them I just saw the lamb
[40:43] stepping forth to redeem me amen
[40:45] hallelujah because brother Braham says
[40:47] that you know the the lamb taking the
[40:49] book is the same as Bo's claiming Ruth
[40:51] and restoring her amen so so it's more
[40:54] than just a abstract thing it's actually
[40:55] God taking up people and place them in
[40:57] their predestinated position but you see
[41:00] there's demon powers that want to hinder
[41:02] your walk and I know this is nothing new
[41:03] to any one of us we know the enem is
[41:05] here to hinder us every day and that's
[41:07] his job and he's pretty diligent we'll
[41:09] give him that but we know he's he's not
[41:11] going to win amen you know we know he
[41:13] cannot win because Christ has given us
[41:16] the victory now as as we read here now
[41:19] the the Lord is seeking people to
[41:21] worship Him in spirit and in truth so
[41:23] it's so absolutely essential that that
[41:26] that as we go through this always
[41:28] remember that God is seeking people to
[41:29] worship Him in spirit and in truth but
[41:31] the enemy doesn't want you to worship
[41:33] Him in spirit and in truth he the enemy
[41:35] wants you to make an agreement with him
[41:39] now I don't want you to get in your mind
[41:41] you got to humanly identify all the
[41:43] gibeonites the Lord is the one that
[41:44] reveals the gibeonites okay and remember
[41:47] the fundamental thing especially in this
[41:49] age where it speaks about in the in the
[41:51] in the latery in church age If any man
[41:53] hear my voice let him open the door I'll
[41:56] come in and S with him and he with me so
[41:58] the voice of God has once again spoken
[42:00] in this end time and it's the same voice
[42:03] where the Lord says but he that entereth
[42:04] in by the door is a um Shepherd of the
[42:06] sheep to him that the Porter openeth and
[42:08] the sheep hear his voice okay so they
[42:11] hear his voice present tense hear his
[42:13] voice and he calleth his own Sheep by
[42:15] name and leadth them out amen so I'm
[42:17] sure you know when the word came your
[42:19] way spoke to your heart there was God
[42:20] Calling You by name walk with me and he
[42:23] putteth forth his own sheep and he goeth
[42:25] before them and the sheep follow him and
[42:28] know his voice and a stranger they will
[42:30] not follow but they will flee from him
[42:32] for they know not the voice of strangers
[42:34] so it's the key it's just like in you
[42:36] know with anything if there's a
[42:37] counterfeit there's got to be a genuine
[42:40] right and the genuine was here before
[42:41] the counterfeit like counterfeit money
[42:43] the counterfeit wasn't here first the
[42:45] genuine was here first right so it's the
[42:47] same thing with the genuine word of God
[42:49] genuine Christianity it was here before
[42:51] the devil made the counterfeit amen so
[42:54] we can we can have a consolation I
[42:56] believe especially in this day where he
[42:59] said my sheep know my voice amen so I
[43:01] trust you know the Genuine Voice of God
[43:04] not the counterfeit voice the genuine
[43:06] one amen and my sheep hear my voice and
[43:09] I know them and they follow me amen but
[43:12] there's a lot of other voices in this
[43:13] day especially that will try and confuse
[43:15] you
[43:16] yes now we uh Joshua now I'm just trying
[43:20] to just kind of jump through these
[43:22] things to kind of lay a bit of a
[43:23] foundation but you know Joshua was
[43:26] commanded to take the the people into
[43:27] the promised land and place them in
[43:29] their inheritance and he was commanded
[43:31] you're going to take the whole thing
[43:33] you're not going to have a little bit of
[43:34] it you're going to take every Divine
[43:35] promise and we know that this is the
[43:38] same this history is repeated itself
[43:40] again where we are not just taking part
[43:42] of the land we're not just coming out of
[43:44] the world and being in a Wilderness kind
[43:46] of situation but we're going into the
[43:48] Holy Ghost I mean because every Divine
[43:50] promise lays in the Holy Spirit I mean
[43:52] lays in the word of God now we're not
[43:55] just I trust you've crossed Jordan
[43:57] you've died out to yourself you've been
[43:59] truly Born Again amen now you've crossed
[44:00] Jordan so now there's enemies in that
[44:03] land that will try and stop you there's
[44:05] doubts and unbelief you got to realize
[44:07] that when unbelief or doubt comes into
[44:09] your heart that's not you that's the
[44:11] enemy right you got to realize that
[44:13] because people say well I don't believe
[44:14] what's actually the devil trying to make
[44:15] you agree with him because he believes
[44:18] in an intellectual way but he doesn't
[44:20] believe it can come to pass right so
[44:21] he'll try and put that upon you and say
[44:23] the word's not true for
[44:25] you amen you see that's I'm trying to
[44:28] because what happens is when we are born
[44:31] the devil is the king of our life we are
[44:33] we walk according to the prince of the
[44:35] power of the air is Ephesians chapter 2
[44:37] and it's the Lord that is so so so the
[44:39] devil's the King on our heart and the
[44:41] and God influences us so then what
[44:44] happens is so so what does that
[44:45] influence your conscience says that's
[44:46] wrong God speaks to your heart you've
[44:48] got to give your life to me you've got
[44:50] to quit those things you've got to you
[44:52] know you you got to surrender your will
[44:54] that's God influencing right but then
[44:56] when you make that full surrender the
[44:57] devil is dethroned the Lord Jesus takes
[45:00] his rightful position and then now it's
[45:02] the devil just influencing right but
[45:04] that's what he'll try and do so but you
[45:06] have to agree with the devil before he
[45:09] can influence you just like you have to
[45:12] agree with the holy spirit before he can
[45:14] take you over right you have to agree
[45:16] with him you say I need the Holy Ghost
[45:17] just agree with the word amen so from
[45:19] your heart say yes Lord that's for me
[45:21] and then what he'll do he'll take you
[45:23] over but you see the devil's a real a
[45:26] real shrewd
[45:27] oh yes he will not come to you in a very
[45:31] obvious way he will not come to you
[45:33] dressed up in priests robes or looking
[45:36] like a voodoo witch doctor or a man in a
[45:38] dress covered in makeup right and say we
[45:41] believe the same Lord Jesus he won't
[45:43] come that way he'll come looking like a
[45:45] Believer talking like a Believer dress
[45:48] like a Believer because he'll sound and
[45:50] then he'll you'll have so much word and
[45:53] quotes that it'll sound like man he
[45:55] really knows what he's talking about he
[45:56] will look very agreeable but the
[45:59] conclusion of what he comes to is not
[46:00] actually what the word starts with
[46:03] there's always a part of this part of
[46:05] that part of here and the conclusion
[46:07] always wrong because we know he did that
[46:09] to Eve the garden he took 99% truth put
[46:13] in a 1% error and brought death to the
[46:15] human race you see it sounded so right
[46:17] but it was so wrong but you see we got
[46:19] to understand that these spirits that
[46:21] the that the Israelites fought against
[46:24] is the same and and previous ages fought
[46:26] against are the same spirits that are
[46:28] here today because we understand that
[46:30] God takes his man but never his Spirit
[46:33] the devil takes his man but never the
[46:35] spirit just kind of lives on and
[46:37] somebody else just keeps coming back
[46:39] like the Holy Spirit see now they both
[46:41] live today now he preaches in Grand
[46:44] Prairie that's why he says this they
[46:45] both live in Grand Prairie you know sure
[46:47] they are both Spirits wherever men are
[46:49] gathered together you find both Spirits
[46:52] so I could say they both live today they
[46:53] live in STS Valley amen they both ever
[46:57] so so these two Spirits the the Rel
[47:00] religious spirit and the Holy Spirit
[47:02] they are still here they haven't gone
[47:04] anywhere they're still upon the Earth so
[47:07] both will sound well the holy spirit
[47:09] will speak the word the complete word
[47:12] the the religious spirit will give part
[47:13] of the word but sounds so true and you
[47:16] see now but you see the problem is with
[47:18] this is is when the when a religious
[47:20] spirit comes in it can sound so right
[47:23] and that's why people give it time of
[47:24] day like you look at this here in Acts
[47:26] chap 15
[47:28] and and so so this is where because we
[47:30] we understand the book of Acts in the
[47:31] start there was a day of Pentecost
[47:33] people were completely Born Into The
[47:35] Kingdom they weren't just attach
[47:37] themselves to the church and you know
[47:39] but but then it came to a point where
[47:41] where the church begin to fall from that
[47:44] position of complete abandonment to the
[47:46] love and to the word of God and it began
[47:48] to fall that when finally when John
[47:50] writes to the the Ephesian age he says
[47:52] you know but but this one thing thou
[47:55] Hast you know I mean against you you
[47:56] have left your first love so when John
[47:59] was given the Book of Revelation there
[48:00] this is years after acts 15 the the age
[48:03] had already fallen from where it started
[48:04] at Pentecost but we know we have come
[48:07] back Amen to a book of Acts before the
[48:09] fall but you see these spirits will
[48:11] still try and come in yeah see look at
[48:14] this and certain men came down from
[48:16] Judea taught the Brethren said except
[48:17] you be circumcised after the manner of
[48:19] Moses you cannot be saved when therefore
[48:22] Paul and Barnabas had no small
[48:24] dissension and disputation with them so
[48:26] they had
[48:27] argument cuz because they realize these
[48:29] men are wrong right they determined that
[48:33] Paul and Barnabas and certain others of
[48:34] them should go up to Jerusalem unto the
[48:36] apostles and Elders about this question
[48:39] why was this question even having weight
[48:41] because these men were claiming to be
[48:43] Believers if they were just I know
[48:46] people who worship Zeus or Mercury or I
[48:48] don't know some Roman god they wouldn't
[48:50] even care about these people if these
[48:51] people were just Jews who are still in
[48:53] the synagogue saying we're under the
[48:54] blood of bulls and goats they they
[48:56] wouldn't have taken this question to
[48:57] Jerusalem but you see these were people
[48:59] professing to be Believers but bringing
[49:01] in a previous age and even look at this
[49:03] here in verse 5 but there rose up
[49:06] certain sect of the Pharisees which
[49:08] believ saying this it was needful to
[49:10] circumcise them and to command them to
[49:13] keep the law of Moses these Pharisees
[49:15] weren't Believers they're still
[49:17] Pharisees claiming Jesus Christ because
[49:19] if they were truly Born Into The Kingdom
[49:21] they wouldn't be have any Pharisee way
[49:23] anymore like the Apostle Paul didn't try
[49:25] and bring in Pharisees them he said said
[49:26] I was a Pharisee the Pharisees but God
[49:29] rich in mercy found me he burned that
[49:31] religious spirit out of me his holy
[49:32] spirit lives in me and we're free from
[49:34] the law but you see you see the reason
[49:37] why this argument even went on is
[49:39] because it wasn't dressed up like a
[49:42] rabbi wasn't dressed up like the high
[49:44] priest wasn't dressed up like the
[49:45] Sanhedrin it was people professing to be
[49:47] Believers what is it now it's a gide
[49:50] gibeonite spirit coming among the people
[49:53] cuz it looks so harmless but yet it's
[49:56] big
[49:57] problem amen you see now what happens is
[50:01] is the enemy loves to attack the word
[50:04] yes we're just going to go through some
[50:06] things we'll get to the gites and these
[50:07] things yeah so so Satan and Eden when he
[50:10] first come to these um um um to these
[50:12] attack to attack a person knowing the
[50:14] children of God was fortified with his
[50:15] word with his word Satan attacked the
[50:17] word say he never attacked the being he
[50:19] attacked the word first and he did this
[50:21] by he taking reasonings and he attacked
[50:23] the word that's how you can because you
[50:24] think how can the word be attacked while
[50:26] it's by reasoning reasoning it away
[50:29] that's why when the devil puts questions
[50:31] in your mind why did this happen how did
[50:33] you know all these questions is HST the
[50:34] wheel of questioning you got to realize
[50:36] that's a gibian spirit trying to get you
[50:38] to agree with him that he wants to
[50:40] hinder your walk but I say kill the
[50:43] thing move on with God it's just a speed
[50:46] bump just run it over I remember in Papa
[50:49] New Guinea there'd be people at night on
[50:50] the road trying to stop you driving you
[50:52] just speed up and drive on you're not
[50:54] stopping they have to get out of the way
[50:56] because if you stop they're going to rob
[50:57] you they're going to shoot you they're
[50:58] going to do whatever so you just speed
[51:00] up and you just keep
[51:01] going that should be the same thing in
[51:03] the spiritual with the devil speed up
[51:05] and keep going don't give him any time
[51:08] don't give him any attention okay keep
[51:11] driving amen he shook and he shook Eve
[51:14] off the path that's right by reasoning
[51:16] human reasonings see and it's such a
[51:19] challenge today we cannot give ourselves
[51:21] to reasoning but we want to but you see
[51:24] the Devil comes in just like these
[51:25] Pharisees and ones it seems so
[51:28] legitimate but yet what is it bringing
[51:30] bringing death it's trying to bind the
[51:32] people up trying to stop them walking
[51:34] and see gibba where they were in the Pro
[51:36] they were living in the promised land
[51:38] this inhabitants of gibian yeah they
[51:41] should have been wiped out they had no
[51:44] right to be there cuz God told Moses and
[51:47] Joshua the whole land is yours don't put
[51:49] up with these Spirits don't put up with
[51:51] these problems you drive this thing out
[51:52] it's going to be a hindrance to your
[51:53] life but you see they were they were
[51:56] that you know they were clever he said
[51:59] um they did work wiely and went and made
[52:02] as it were they had been ambassadors and
[52:04] took old sacks upon their asses and wine
[52:07] bottles old rent and bound up yes and
[52:10] old shoes and clothed them with um cloth
[52:12] them upon their feet and all garments
[52:14] upon them and all the bread of their
[52:15] Provisions was dry and moldy and they
[52:18] went to Joshua unto the camp of Gilgo
[52:20] and said unto him and to the men of
[52:21] Israel we come from a far country now
[52:24] therefore make ye a league with us so
[52:27] basically we've come from a long way
[52:28] away we've come from a long time ago see
[52:31] these Spirits are still the spirits that
[52:33] fought the lutherans and fought the
[52:35] methodists and fought the pilgrim
[52:36] Holiness and the and the Baptist the you
[52:39] the genuine move of God in those days
[52:40] those spirits still try and come in here
[52:43] right so these gibit say we've come from
[52:45] a long time ago we're harmless we're not
[52:47] here in your way we're not going to
[52:49] bother you you know and it seems so
[52:51] reasonable these people want to be in
[52:52] Alliance with us everyone we've come
[52:54] against wants to fight us there's no one
[52:56] who wants to be on our side they're not
[52:58] even in the land it seems fine this was
[53:00] this was a few Church ages ago we don't
[53:02] need to worry about this kind of thing
[53:03] coming in but you see what happened see
[53:05] their wine bottles were old rent and
[53:08] bound up see and this is so so so what
[53:11] happened is is is is we know wine
[53:14] bottles in the Bible are not glass
[53:16] bottles they are wine skins they are
[53:18] they are human skin I mean not human
[53:20] skin animal skin that would be kind of
[53:22] nasty you know cannibals no let's just
[53:24] leave them alone but but it's animal
[53:27] that's been made into a bottle right and
[53:29] then but but we know leather must be
[53:32] must keep you got to keep oiling it
[53:33] otherwise it cracks and it breaks right
[53:35] so when so when you put a new wine is is
[53:38] still got life in it it ferments okay so
[53:41] when you put a new wine into an old
[53:42] bottle like Jesus says the bottle can't
[53:45] move with the wine so it just rinse and
[53:47] then everything's lost yeah it's the
[53:49] same thing with the believer doesn't
[53:51] have the Holy Ghost they can't contain
[53:52] the new wine amen they say the days of
[53:55] Miracles are passed that's not right my
[53:56] church believes this and their wine skin
[53:59] bursts so they had they had old wine
[54:01] balls old rent and bound up now this
[54:04] word bound it means to be afflicted it
[54:06] means to be oppressed shut up to be in a
[54:09] straight you know to be distressed to be
[54:11] B um besieged so so they had bound so
[54:15] this Spirit had so bound these people up
[54:17] they couldn't even move one they were
[54:19] they had already been rent there no holy
[54:21] ghost moving in it anymore and you'll
[54:23] see you take you take gibit spirits and
[54:25] coming amongst the message what happens
[54:26] it Grieves the Holy Spirit Away God
[54:28] doesn't move in power anymore there's no
[54:30] reality of the word it's just a theory
[54:32] and just going through a formality but
[54:34] I'm against that today I'm for God
[54:36] moving I'm for the Holy Spirit moving
[54:38] I'm for Liberty I'm for reality I'm for
[54:41] the power of God I'm for the word
[54:42] putting on flesh that's what I'm
[54:44] contending for the faith wants to live
[54:46] it to the Saints amen so I'm not here to
[54:49] bind up all wine skins no this is not
[54:51] why we're here no but we want the Holy
[54:53] Spirit to come into our lives that we
[54:54] can move with the stimulation life of
[54:56] the word can move and make room and we
[54:58] can grow and praise God and Shout amen
[55:01] but you see that's the problem as
[55:02] Spirits coming and try and hold people
[55:04] back like this and their bread of their
[55:06] provision was dry and moldy sure it was
[55:08] fresh when it came in that age but now
[55:10] it's old moldy stale throt BR it's no
[55:15] good moldy bread okay no good it was
[55:19] okay in that age it's not okay today and
[55:21] so people try and bring in things from
[55:23] previous ages like the Pharisees moldy
[55:25] stinking rotten food amen but it seemed
[55:29] so harmless because it seemed like a far
[55:32] away thing but you see the devil is
[55:35] clever one he makes it look harmless but
[55:37] two he studies your response based on
[55:40] your makeup and now the enemy is going
[55:43] to study our strategy with the word now
[55:45] Satan studied that all out so the
[55:47] perfect till when he come to Eve he had
[55:49] the best strategy he could use upon her
[55:52] and that was to reason with the word now
[55:53] you never want to reason with the word
[55:55] just believe it don't try to explain it
[55:57] don't try to figure it out now you
[55:58] cannot figure out God so God is the word
[56:01] and it's just made to believe that's our
[56:03] strength just accept the word and anyone
[56:05] knows that a seed in the right kind of a
[56:07] ground will produce its kind you just
[56:09] take the word so the enemy studies your
[56:12] strategy with the word and our approach
[56:15] to the word is really based on our
[56:17] temperament some people love details
[56:19] they'll go through all the detail that's
[56:20] fine some people aren't detailed people
[56:24] they're not worried about details they
[56:25] say yeah amen and walk on those things
[56:28] are fine right but but the enemy will
[56:31] study your your strategy with the word
[56:34] how do you take the word how do you read
[56:37] it see we're not Catholics here where
[56:40] it's just the minister that gives it and
[56:41] then we just come back again no you've
[56:43] got to study the word yourself you've
[56:44] got to get into the scripture into the
[56:46] quotes yourself and pray and seek God
[56:48] you got to you know this is not two
[56:50] meals a week come on now this should be
[56:54] three meals a day enjoy the word you're
[56:57] praying praise the Lord you hear a
[56:58] scripture you know just just absorb the
[57:00] word just enjoy it amen let God reveal
[57:02] himself to you amen so you see the see
[57:06] the enemy wants to get us off the path
[57:08] now and then if he becomes see this
[57:10] person that cented on Christ if he's
[57:12] just a little bit nervous or emotional
[57:14] if you don't watch that individual he
[57:16] will Drift Off to this side into
[57:17] fanaticism and he will become a regular
[57:20] just with every Wind Blows there he goes
[57:22] everywhere the rattle comes why he will
[57:24] take after that gibbi andite will come
[57:27] in and we try based on that person's
[57:29] temperament will take them off into one
[57:31] way if someone's see there's nothing
[57:33] wrong some people are naturally just a
[57:34] little bit nervous brother I'm said he
[57:36] had a nervous temperament he was made
[57:38] that way some of us are more emotional
[57:42] that's okay there's nothing wrong with
[57:45] being emotional nothing even wrong with
[57:46] being a little bit nervous but don't let
[57:48] the devil take you a GI not come and you
[57:51] agree with it and you run off to
[57:52] everything that just rattles looking for
[57:53] the new best thing no stay with the word
[57:56] of God and God will reveal himself in
[57:58] his word sir amen see but then it's also
[58:03] the other side men usually when they're
[58:04] born in the kingdom of God his face set
[58:06] straight towards Calvary now if he's
[58:08] just a little bit emotional he'll go off
[58:10] on fanaticism if you just uh if he's
[58:13] just a little bit his shrewd education
[58:16] he'll get so starchy that he sits over
[58:18] on on this side that's right but the
[58:20] True Church of the Living God goes right
[58:22] down the center of the highway preaching
[58:24] a sane solid gospel calling from both
[58:27] sides amen that's what we need today a
[58:28] church that he wouldn't be ashamed of
[58:30] for anyone to come into amen I want to
[58:33] be have a church that Jesus would not be
[58:35] ashamed for people to walk on the door
[58:36] but Jesus would be proud would be happy
[58:39] oh I'm so glad there's a lighthouse I'm
[58:41] so glad there's a group of people that
[58:42] have surrendered to me amen where I can
[58:44] I can bring people in and they can find
[58:46] rest for their souls hallelujah amen see
[58:49] amen that's what we want amen it's
[58:51] perfectly governed by the Holy Spirit no
[58:53] fanaticism no stue just a good worm warm
[58:56] Church filled with God's spirit what's
[58:58] that the good solid gospel teaching
[59:00] pastors that's what we need amen God
[59:02] help us to have it God wants us to have
[59:04] it I believe it so he doesn't want us to
[59:06] go off in starchiness he doesn't want us
[59:08] to go off in fanaticism he wants us down
[59:11] the middle a good solid warm Church
[59:13] where the love of God has shed Upon Our
[59:15] Hearts I mean but you see you see we
[59:17] start off centered towards Calvary but
[59:20] the devil will send gibeonites to hinder
[59:22] our walk based on our temperament see
[59:25] some of us are actually naturally lean
[59:27] towards a legalistic way right based on
[59:30] our makeup so he'll send a gibon night
[59:32] Spirit to pull someone towards legalism
[59:35] some of us are more of a liberal Spirit
[59:37] liberal kind of nature say he'll bring a
[59:39] religious spirit in that draws us that
[59:41] way amen so but but then what happens
[59:44] you stay there you don't it just hinders
[59:46] your walk the joy you once have is gone
[59:48] and what's happened well it's a
[59:50] gibeonite spirit that you've made league
[59:52] with you can break agreements with the
[59:55] devil anytime
[59:57] amen hallelujah
[1:00:00] so praise the Lord so we don't want to
[1:00:03] go off on one side or the other but you
[1:00:05] see either those things being starchy
[1:00:08] being being intellectual or going off
[1:00:10] into emotionalism both those things you
[1:00:12] can base in the a part of the word so it
[1:00:15] can come across sounding so right like
[1:00:18] we've been restored to the book of Acts
[1:00:20] Pentecostal church we should be shouting
[1:00:21] and speaking tongues and running the
[1:00:23] aisle amen but if it's God doing it amen
[1:00:26] that's that's all in order oh but we've
[1:00:29] got this Eagle age anointing where we
[1:00:31] can see from eternity to Eternity and we
[1:00:33] can see the whole word of God has come
[1:00:34] open so we should study into it
[1:00:36] absolutely but don't just go off on that
[1:00:38] with no life right don't just go off
[1:00:40] running around shouting praising God
[1:00:43] without the word you've got to have both
[1:00:46] amen and if you truly have the word him
[1:00:49] you'll get the shouting screaming you'll
[1:00:51] get the Deep teaching you'll get the
[1:00:53] whole package I mean cuz remember this
[1:00:55] you know this this word of God is not
[1:00:58] just an entree it's not just dessert
[1:01:00] it's the whole nine yards it's the seven
[1:01:03] square meal amen it's the whole package
[1:01:06] because a lot of people especially in
[1:01:07] the past used to say well if you want
[1:01:09] the supernatural therefore you don't
[1:01:10] want the word or if you want the word
[1:01:12] you don't want the supernatural I don't
[1:01:13] understand that kind of a logic I want
[1:01:14] it all I want all that Jesus is all that
[1:01:18] he is not just part of him I want I want
[1:01:20] the whole guy I want the whole pack I
[1:01:22] want the whole word I want to walk
[1:01:24] remember Enoch walked with God not just
[1:01:26] part of God all of him so we want to
[1:01:29] walk with all that he is amen so there
[1:01:33] is a gibi andite spirit in this land you
[1:01:35] just look into like brother BR would say
[1:01:37] you know the you know there's a Church
[1:01:39] of Christ spirit I don't have quotes but
[1:01:41] you look into it you know they didn't
[1:01:43] believe in Divine Healing they didn't
[1:01:44] even believe in really music in the
[1:01:46] church you see that in the world today
[1:01:48] you see that in M message ranks today oh
[1:01:50] we don't need to be jumping and shouting
[1:01:52] and banging on the you know having
[1:01:54] having Lively music who said we
[1:01:56] shouldn't have that you man I think if
[1:01:58] we went if a lot of people went back
[1:02:00] into David's day that they'd say this is
[1:02:01] all out of order where he's dancing they
[1:02:04] banging on the tambs and shouting and
[1:02:05] praising God and it would have been a
[1:02:07] noisy time yes but it was anointed by it
[1:02:10] was in it was an order cuz it was
[1:02:11] surrendered to the Lord amen it wasn't
[1:02:14] the whole thing cuz brother Ram said you
[1:02:15] can you can have all the finest music
[1:02:17] but have a temple like a buz saw you've
[1:02:19] got a problem right so you know what
[1:02:21] does it produce what is being produced
[1:02:23] in the people but you see so so that
[1:02:25] same spirit that that that um the
[1:02:28] prophet fought against is still here
[1:02:30] remember we're not exempt from these
[1:02:31] things just because we you know some
[1:02:33] people think well I'm in the message
[1:02:34] therefore it's like some buffer thing
[1:02:36] that you know all these things of past
[1:02:38] ages aren't going to bother us no they
[1:02:40] will bother you because you're walking
[1:02:42] in the truth and you we will be tested
[1:02:44] by every Spirit every Spirit the devil
[1:02:47] has he's going to fire it at you like
[1:02:49] you look at the natural Warfare the
[1:02:51] enemy you know Russia or Ukraine
[1:02:53] whatever they've got a certain weapon it
[1:02:55] doesn't work that they try another
[1:02:56] weapon then that doesn't work so they
[1:02:58] try another weapon who you know who's
[1:02:59] you there's always an evolution of
[1:03:01] warfare so the devil will take one
[1:03:03] Spirit tried against you that comes back
[1:03:06] to feated well you know unbelief doesn't
[1:03:08] work anymore that guy got dethroned well
[1:03:10] I'm going to bring jealousy in jealousy
[1:03:13] doesn't work well I'm going to bring
[1:03:14] being being not
[1:03:16] contented I'm going to bring a
[1:03:17] loneliness Spirit then I'm going to
[1:03:19] bring all these kind of things it's
[1:03:20] gibit trying to come in and then what
[1:03:22] happen but but one by one they will turn
[1:03:24] back to hell in an ambulance well they
[1:03:27] wouldn't have an ambulance down there
[1:03:28] but anyway they're going be going back
[1:03:29] in a body bag right that's how it should
[1:03:32] be there should be a kill list your
[1:03:33] testimony should be a bunch of Devils on
[1:03:35] your trophy cabinet that God has given
[1:03:37] you victory over all of them right and
[1:03:40] if you're fighting against one today you
[1:03:41] got to know that's going to come to an
[1:03:42] end that battle's going to end but
[1:03:44] you've got to end it amen you just got
[1:03:47] to like these gibeonites they could have
[1:03:48] made legal they could have waited with
[1:03:50] the Lord and said and God would said no
[1:03:51] they're they're lying to you they would
[1:03:53] have been gone amen so this is why we've
[1:03:57] got to we've got to identify these
[1:04:00] things now there's a gibeonite spirit in
[1:04:02] the world today among the believer says
[1:04:04] we don't need the supernatural we don't
[1:04:06] need the gifts that's for children we
[1:04:08] have the word now and then and then
[1:04:11] they'll and we'll go through this now so
[1:04:13] so they go to 1 Corinthians 13 though I
[1:04:15] speak with tongues of men and of angels
[1:04:17] and have not charity which is divine
[1:04:19] love I become a sounding brass or a
[1:04:21] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[1:04:23] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[1:04:25] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:04:27] have all Faith so that I could remove
[1:04:29] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:04:31] nothing I'm agreeing with this by the
[1:04:33] way people can know all the Mysteries
[1:04:35] they can they can put together from from
[1:04:37] um Faith as a substance 1947 to
[1:04:40] communion 1965 and not have Divine love
[1:04:44] oh but they know all Mysteries but
[1:04:45] where's the life of God see this message
[1:04:47] came that the life of God will come and
[1:04:49] Tabernacle human beings once again amen
[1:04:51] that's the whole purpose of the message
[1:04:53] that God would dwell in man there be
[1:04:55] perfect Unity between God and man amen
[1:04:58] Lord and though I bestow all my goods to
[1:05:00] feed the poor and though I give my body
[1:05:02] to be burned and have not charity it
[1:05:03] profiteth me nothing charity suffereth
[1:05:06] long as kind charity envieth not charity
[1:05:08] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[1:05:11] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[1:05:13] not her own is not easily provoked
[1:05:15] thinketh no evil amen rejoiceth not in
[1:05:19] iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
[1:05:21] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:05:22] hopeth all things endureth all things
[1:05:25] charity never fath but whether there be
[1:05:27] prophecies they will fail whether there
[1:05:29] be tongues they shall see whether be
[1:05:31] knowledge it shall vanish for we know in
[1:05:33] part and we prophesy in part but when
[1:05:35] that which is perfect has come then that
[1:05:37] which is in part shall be done away amen
[1:05:40] now we're going to come to this because
[1:05:42] a lot of people take that statement say
[1:05:43] well we have the perfect interpretation
[1:05:46] of the word so that which perfect has
[1:05:47] come therefore we don't need the gifts
[1:05:50] anymore they misrepresent what brother
[1:05:52] Braham says now this Capstone remember
[1:05:55] this the ministry of brother Ram is to
[1:05:57] is to unite the head Christ to the body
[1:06:00] right that is his whole Ministry just
[1:06:02] like John the Baptist introduce Jesus
[1:06:04] Christ to the Believers the first coming
[1:06:06] right so Elijah will be sent once again
[1:06:08] to introduce what Jesus Christ the head
[1:06:10] the word to the body and that int that
[1:06:13] introduction has already been taken
[1:06:14] place amen uh Malachi 4 has has has has
[1:06:19] invited you has joined you right have
[1:06:22] you become one with the word am that
[1:06:25] introduction has already happened so so
[1:06:27] what is this Capstone now see the
[1:06:29] Capstone is a person even charity you
[1:06:31] would say well it's the love of God well
[1:06:33] God is love right it's not just an
[1:06:35] attribute of God this is God himself
[1:06:37] coming down into the body of Christ amen
[1:06:40] so what is this Capstone now the
[1:06:41] Lutheran under justification the feet
[1:06:43] raised it like that wisley under
[1:06:44] sanctification the Pentecostals under
[1:06:46] the arms the works and deeds and so
[1:06:48] forth had to be calvinist so had to be
[1:06:49] Armenian had to be legalist this is why
[1:06:52] you see a legalistic Spirit come in
[1:06:54] among the Believers it's the for age
[1:06:56] like the Pharisees here in Acts chapter
[1:06:57] 15 bringing legalism in you've got to do
[1:07:00] this and you've got to do that no you've
[1:07:01] got to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:04] like brother R said about the Philippian
[1:07:05] jaila many times we tell people what not
[1:07:07] to do we should tell them what they
[1:07:08] should do believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:07:11] Christ believe the word take God out his
[1:07:13] word and thine and thy house shall be
[1:07:15] saved amen amen hallelujah amen now we
[1:07:18] come to the Head the Capstone Grace
[1:07:20] Grace the Capstone cried what The
[1:07:22] Headstone crying what Grace Grace pass
[1:07:25] from death and Creed into a Living Word
[1:07:27] of the Living God so he says now we have
[1:07:29] come to the head so we're not coming
[1:07:31] it's here am mean the headship is here
[1:07:33] on the body amen I trust is not going
[1:07:35] over your head but you know Christ and
[1:07:37] his bride have become one amen what you
[1:07:39] should see among you is the living
[1:07:41] manifestation of Jesus Christ the word
[1:07:43] put on flesh amen so we have come to
[1:07:45] this but you see now you see what
[1:07:47] happens is people will take this and we
[1:07:49] know that you know we know that this
[1:07:51] Divine love here this charity should be
[1:07:54] manifested right by this shall all men
[1:07:56] know that you are my disciples if you
[1:07:58] have loved one for another so it's not
[1:08:00] just a term it should be lived yes amen
[1:08:04] there should be such a love between us
[1:08:05] that it's painful when church is over
[1:08:07] and we all go home we don't see each
[1:08:09] other for a few days we should long to
[1:08:10] see one another like brother R says you
[1:08:13] know when you you should be here when
[1:08:14] you know the church doors are going to
[1:08:16] come open because you're going to see
[1:08:17] your brethren why cuz we have Lov one
[1:08:19] for another that's what we should be
[1:08:20] known by it's a genuine love you know
[1:08:23] sure we're all different we have you
[1:08:25] know sharpens Z different personalities
[1:08:27] and things rubbing and you know things
[1:08:29] go on but there should be such a love
[1:08:32] Lord there be should should be and and
[1:08:34] not a put on but a genuine love a
[1:08:36] genuine understanding a genuine care it
[1:08:38] should be so lived it should be it it
[1:08:40] should really become
[1:08:42] common not in terms of Tak it for
[1:08:44] granted but should be so natural that we
[1:08:46] love one another so much hallelujah amen
[1:08:48] praise the Lord amen because even you
[1:08:50] know even with I'm just trying to find
[1:08:53] where I am
[1:08:54] here
[1:08:57] see it says in first John if if if you
[1:09:00] don't love your brother you're in if you
[1:09:02] hate your brother you're in darkness
[1:09:04] even until now so if you even have an
[1:09:06] ought if you even have a unforgiveness a
[1:09:08] resentment a jealousy get rid of the
[1:09:10] thing you don't need it you really don't
[1:09:12] need to carry that stuff you should
[1:09:13] carry love and peace and joy Temperance
[1:09:17] Faith all the virtues of the spirit that
[1:09:20] the fruit of the spirit you should just
[1:09:21] be weighed down with the fruit of the
[1:09:22] spirit not be weighed down with busness
[1:09:24] resentment all all those things because
[1:09:27] you see even the Lord Jesus when he but
[1:09:29] we got to understand when when we
[1:09:31] forgive when you forgive someone it
[1:09:34] doesn't mean you don't feel the pain and
[1:09:35] the hurt from what they've done cuz it's
[1:09:37] a healing process now comes in when you
[1:09:40] really forgive someone sure you give
[1:09:42] over the right to hold it against them
[1:09:44] there's no grudge go you know it's all
[1:09:45] gone but he can still feel the pain amen
[1:09:49] right but what happens now there's a
[1:09:51] there is a Healing Begins to take place
[1:09:53] like you even look at here with with our
[1:09:55] lord Jesus when he said father forgive
[1:09:57] them they don't know what they do he was
[1:09:58] still feeling the pain of their
[1:10:00] physically of the crucifixion and he
[1:10:03] died of a broken heart so he was feeling
[1:10:05] those things but he didn't hold what
[1:10:07] they did against them he had a genuine a
[1:10:09] genuine forgiveness and I believe it's
[1:10:11] because he was actually looking at them
[1:10:13] through his own blood as his blood was
[1:10:14] running down into his eyes he was
[1:10:16] looking through his own blood at them
[1:10:18] saying Lord forgive them and if you can
[1:10:19] look through at someone through the
[1:10:21] blood of Jesus Christ you won't hold it
[1:10:24] against anyone amen but you will you
[1:10:26] will have a genuine you'll genuinely
[1:10:27] feel sorry for that person as brother R
[1:10:30] would say here in the Great Commission
[1:10:31] then let God go to talking to you this
[1:10:33] is in prayer and you'll see maybe that
[1:10:35] where that what that man's been through
[1:10:37] the devil has Twisted him up somewhere
[1:10:39] caused him to do that though he's
[1:10:40] absolutely wrong before you leave the
[1:10:43] Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry
[1:10:45] for that man this is real genuine
[1:10:48] forgiveness you'll feel sorry for that
[1:10:49] person you will want to see that person
[1:10:51] saved above all things but will you
[1:10:53] still feel the pain of what they did you
[1:10:55] might do will it still but that doesn't
[1:10:57] mean you haven't forgiven that person
[1:11:01] right you'll be sympathizing with that
[1:11:03] brother and you'll get back down to
[1:11:04] earth and when you get back down to
[1:11:06] Earth again you'll go over to that
[1:11:07] brother and shake his hand because you
[1:11:09] know he's been what he's been through
[1:11:11] you can't stand with a mortal in the
[1:11:13] presence of God and condemn anybody I
[1:11:15] don't believe no sir even if he is a
[1:11:17] rank
[1:11:19] sinner amen so the love of God should be
[1:11:21] our hearts in such a powerful way
[1:11:24] now let's just I just we'll go here
[1:11:27] we'll just finish reading 1 Corinthians
[1:11:29] 13 it says when I was a child I spake as
[1:11:31] a child I understood as a child though I
[1:11:33] thought as a child but when I became a
[1:11:35] man I put away childish things now for
[1:11:38] now we see through a grass a glass
[1:11:40] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[1:11:42] in part but then shall I know even as I
[1:11:44] am known and now abideth hope faith
[1:11:47] charity these three but the greatest of
[1:11:49] these is Charity so if we're going back
[1:11:52] to this thought this Gib night spirit
[1:11:53] will come in and say well that which is
[1:11:55] when that which is perfect has come that
[1:11:58] which is in part is done away with as we
[1:12:00] read there earlier in 1 Corinthians
[1:12:02] now and then they will they will take
[1:12:04] part of this or that because remember a
[1:12:07] Gibby night spirit will misquote the
[1:12:08] word won't deny it we just misquote it 1
[1:12:12] Corinthians 13 says this now that which
[1:12:14] is imp perfect has come that which is in
[1:12:16] part shall be done away with so all
[1:12:18] these little things have jumping up and
[1:12:19] down like a kid trying to speak in
[1:12:22] tongues and all these other things so so
[1:12:24] it's what is it he's saying these
[1:12:26] childlike things of trying to
[1:12:28] manufacture gifts trying to put on the
[1:12:30] moving of the Holy Spirit those things
[1:12:32] are now done away with because we don't
[1:12:34] try like I remember when I was in
[1:12:36] Pentecostal Church they said just say
[1:12:37] hallelujah over and over again you'll
[1:12:38] speak in tongues and I did but you see
[1:12:42] it's trying to see we're not trying to
[1:12:45] manufacture gifts I trust I know this
[1:12:47] may be very obvious I'm probably Captain
[1:12:49] Obvious today but you know you know you
[1:12:50] see it's we're not trying but you see
[1:12:53] what they do is they say then
[1:12:55] when that which is perfect and we do
[1:12:57] have today by God's help the perfect
[1:12:59] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:13:02] Vindication so what they'll giveing I
[1:13:04] will say is look we have the perfect
[1:13:05] interpretation that which is in part is
[1:13:07] done away with and they'll say so
[1:13:09] therefore the gift's a part we don't
[1:13:10] need it we just need the word that's not
[1:13:12] what brother braham's saying he's saying
[1:13:14] that which is in part being childish is
[1:13:16] trying to trying to manufacture but see
[1:13:19] see the devil's shrewd eh he's a shrewd
[1:13:21] fellow because he doesn't want God to
[1:13:23] manifest in the group of believers
[1:13:25] right because he wants to make us cold
[1:13:27] Lal formal and Powerless amen so we
[1:13:31] aren't trying we aren't acting like
[1:13:33] children see children can't talk can't
[1:13:36] think can't function like an adult
[1:13:38] they're still growing sure am mean we're
[1:13:40] not trying to do these things I'm
[1:13:42] laboring this point because I want you
[1:13:43] to see I just want this Gibby KN to go
[1:13:45] away I want it to be dead buried and
[1:13:47] forgotten amen because because there is
[1:13:50] a spirit trying to stop God move even
[1:13:53] even when I first came among believers
[1:13:55] there was such a fear of of gifts yeah
[1:13:58] that's right why but to me people are
[1:14:00] afraid to surrender to God they're
[1:14:02] afraid to let God move people even
[1:14:04] afraid to stand up and shout people even
[1:14:06] afraid to say Amen why is it giving
[1:14:08] night Spirit saying but we're meant to
[1:14:09] be reverent do you want to become like a
[1:14:12] Catholic Church do you want to become
[1:14:13] like an Anglican Church I'm dead formal
[1:14:15] thing I had to go to an Anglican Church
[1:14:18] three times a week at boarding school oh
[1:14:20] boy there's about as there's no life
[1:14:23] yeah boring school absolutely
[1:14:25] and it was very boring oh boy there was
[1:14:28] no life there nothing spoke to us
[1:14:30] nothing spoke to there's no life
[1:14:32] changing God wasn't welcome in the place
[1:14:34] we don't want to be like that you say oh
[1:14:36] but it's an order and it's reverent no
[1:14:38] it becomes dead that's what I saying
[1:14:40] before someone can be shouting dancing
[1:14:43] speaking in tongues and if it's God it's
[1:14:45] an order amen right so we should never
[1:14:48] ever stand against these things we say
[1:14:50] Lord may we Just Surrender ourselves
[1:14:53] that when you do what you want to do
[1:14:55] when you want to do it here I am yes
[1:14:57] that's it cuz that's not trying that's
[1:14:59] just surrendering amen so whatever part
[1:15:02] so so we do have the perfect
[1:15:04] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:15:06] Vindication but we do not like a Gib not
[1:15:09] Spirit do away with the gifts do away
[1:15:11] with the Supernatural cuz people say
[1:15:13] well we have the word what does that
[1:15:15] even
[1:15:16] mean he is the word he is a person he's
[1:15:20] not just look this is just God in print
[1:15:22] form I don't know why I said just but
[1:15:24] this is God in print form but the letter
[1:15:26] kth but the spirit giveth life amen so
[1:15:29] it's easy to quote the dead letter of
[1:15:31] the word without the spirit and but that
[1:15:33] kills dead sermons kill people yeah dead
[1:15:36] churches kill people amen but living
[1:15:38] sermons bring life a living Church
[1:15:41] brings life that's why life comes into
[1:15:43] Camp that's why life comes into the
[1:15:45] church why because we don't Minister a
[1:15:47] dead letter just an argument a bunch of
[1:15:49] quotes and things put together no this
[1:15:51] is not what we stand for we stand for
[1:15:52] the spirit of God coming taking the word
[1:15:55] anointing the people making it live amen
[1:15:58] amen but you see what we need to do is
[1:16:00] we just need to relax ourselves and let
[1:16:02] God
[1:16:03] live you want to see the supernatural
[1:16:05] relax don't be all tense don't be all
[1:16:07] troubled don't worry about the a giut
[1:16:09] will make you worried do you think when
[1:16:11] they came they came to Joshua's Camp
[1:16:13] there would have been a real anxiousness
[1:16:15] coming to the camp who are these people
[1:16:17] what's going on this is unexpected what
[1:16:18] it's a Gibby night Spirit trying to make
[1:16:20] you troubled don't be troubled just
[1:16:22] relax and let God do what he wants to do
[1:16:24] amen amen amen see we are not able
[1:16:27] Ministers of the New Testament that just
[1:16:30] give the letter but no it's not the
[1:16:32] letter but the spirit for the L kth but
[1:16:34] the spirit giveth life amen this is what
[1:16:37] we need
[1:16:39] to amen now the word of God I'm going to
[1:16:42] go through a few of these if I don't get
[1:16:43] through them all well we'll pick it up
[1:16:45] some other time but you see the word of
[1:16:47] God is God himself amen amen so I'm not
[1:16:49] just walking with a bunch of message
[1:16:51] books I'm walking with Christ amen sure
[1:16:54] I've got them I've got it on my phone
[1:16:55] I've got them on whatever but we're not
[1:16:58] just walking with tapes we're walking
[1:17:00] with God himself amen see see cuz people
[1:17:03] say well we have the word we don't need
[1:17:05] the supernatural you say you want the
[1:17:06] Supernatural and you don't want the word
[1:17:07] no I want all of it cuz if you have him
[1:17:09] you have everything amen if you have the
[1:17:11] giver you have the gifts amen if you
[1:17:13] have the giver you have Deliverance if
[1:17:15] you have the giver you have the baptism
[1:17:17] of the Holy Ghost if you have the giver
[1:17:18] you have joy you have peace you have
[1:17:20] love you have every you have the Rapture
[1:17:22] you have the change of the body amen you
[1:17:24] have the prodical coming you have
[1:17:26] everything yes sir amen that's why we
[1:17:28] must have him and we must make him King
[1:17:30] hallelujah hallelujah that's what we've
[1:17:32] got to do see some people think well
[1:17:34] another gibot will come along and say
[1:17:35] well we need to line everything up from
[1:17:37] from Faith as a substance to communion
[1:17:39] and get it all right trying to have a
[1:17:42] Revival by being an intellectual Revival
[1:17:45] they say well this is a word Revival
[1:17:46] brother Ben this is this is not a
[1:17:49] Revival of gifts this is a word Revival
[1:17:51] but you see if it is a word Revival it
[1:17:53] is Christ coming alive in the people so
[1:17:56] we have the gifts remember God is a god
[1:17:57] of addition Luther came with the just
[1:18:00] shall live by faith then came Wesley he
[1:18:02] didn't God didn't subtract oh that's not
[1:18:04] right he built upon justification with
[1:18:06] sanctification when the B when the true
[1:18:08] Pentecostals came along with the
[1:18:09] restoration of the gifts they didn't
[1:18:11] subtract justification sanctification
[1:18:13] God added the gifts amen and then this
[1:18:15] messenger came with the life the god
[1:18:17] coming down not just anointing but
[1:18:19] dwelling in a people it's an addition
[1:18:21] Hallelujah so it's not a taking away
[1:18:23] amen so people say well we're having a
[1:18:25] word Revival and we just need to get all
[1:18:27] the quotes together it's this revival
[1:18:29] we're in is not an intellectual Revival
[1:18:31] that's right now I'm not against
[1:18:33] studying I work in science I've studied
[1:18:36] right I I believe in studying the quotes
[1:18:39] studying the scripture be diligent in
[1:18:40] those things but if you take that as
[1:18:43] your your everything see people are
[1:18:46] looking for new things trying to find
[1:18:48] something new but just by study instead
[1:18:50] of letting God open it cuz when God
[1:18:53] reveals it there's always power there
[1:18:55] like Jesus when he stood he said his
[1:18:56] Doctrine was came with power it was
[1:18:59] anointed it was living amen so so there
[1:19:03] a gibot come along and say we need to
[1:19:05] line up quote after quote letter by
[1:19:08] letter and and brother R said well
[1:19:09] they've been doing that for 2,000 years
[1:19:11] arguing because he because people said
[1:19:13] to him if we just get back to the
[1:19:15] original Greek if we can just understand
[1:19:18] it in the word It Was Written in then we
[1:19:20] can get it right he says you'll never do
[1:19:22] it councelor NAA a big part of that that
[1:19:24] Council was arguing as Jesus a man or
[1:19:26] Divine yeah and they're arguing about
[1:19:29] the Greek arguing about different things
[1:19:30] those arguments being that intellectual
[1:19:32] gibi andite has been in the church for
[1:19:34] 2,000 years it's the time we kick him
[1:19:36] out and it's time we break that cycle
[1:19:38] and let God Minister his word amen where
[1:19:41] it's not this this bride's Revival is
[1:19:43] not a Revival just an intellectual
[1:19:46] understanding that's right amen but it's
[1:19:48] God opening his word what is that
[1:19:50] revivalist like when the two on the way
[1:19:52] to emus was sitting around the dinner
[1:19:53] table with Jesus and he broke the bread
[1:19:56] there and then their eyes came open and
[1:19:57] they knew him so when God manifests
[1:19:59] himself our spiritual eyes should come
[1:20:01] open what he's done in the past he's
[1:20:04] doing again cuz he broke the bread to
[1:20:06] the thousands so they saw that same
[1:20:08] movement there before his crucifixion
[1:20:10] and he did the same thing after his
[1:20:12] resurrection to prove to the people that
[1:20:14] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:20:15] forever and what it do it revived them
[1:20:18] they were walking with the word
[1:20:19] brokenhearted downcast their world had
[1:20:21] fallen apart they felt like their hearts
[1:20:23] were like lid balloons
[1:20:25] but yet the word was opening himself to
[1:20:27] them all the time but then when he did
[1:20:28] something he did before then the rise
[1:20:31] came over what happened then they had a
[1:20:32] Revival am me then they had an Awakening
[1:20:35] amen because they realized because he
[1:20:37] lives he said because I live you shall
[1:20:39] live also then they went up to Pentecost
[1:20:41] they came alive Hallelujah so what so
[1:20:44] what we need is God to move to
[1:20:46] demonstrate his word like never before
[1:20:49] what does it do that should open our
[1:20:50] spiritual eyes I've heard about this
[1:20:52] I've read about this someone's test was
[1:20:55] like this and he's the same today what
[1:20:56] happens then your eyes come open and you
[1:20:58] know he is alive he's alive Hallelujah
[1:21:02] more than an argument but a reality amen
[1:21:04] more than just putting quotes together
[1:21:06] but the god of the quotes comes in
[1:21:07] behind it and manifest it amen more than
[1:21:10] putting scriptures together but the god
[1:21:11] of the scripture steps forth out of
[1:21:13] history and lives Among Us that's what
[1:21:15] we need friends amen you say Well it
[1:21:18] happens but it can happen a lot more
[1:21:20] let's not put a glass ceiling on this
[1:21:21] thing let's just go right up amen smash
[1:21:23] the thing and walk
[1:21:25] amen we're not here just to have an
[1:21:26] intellectual Revival no we want the word
[1:21:28] and the spirit the mechanics and the
[1:21:30] Dynamics amen we know when brother Bram
[1:21:33] left this gospel worked amen he
[1:21:36] demonstrated God God took him to show
[1:21:38] you the power of the blood God took him
[1:21:41] to show look I'll take a man from a
[1:21:43] Bootlegger's family misunderstood broken
[1:21:46] life troubled life poor not welcome
[1:21:49] anywhere had a black name and all these
[1:21:51] things and I'm going to transform them
[1:21:53] by my blood I'm going to live in this
[1:21:55] man and I'm going to show you what I can
[1:21:57] do I'll show you my highest achievement
[1:21:59] where man is restored back where Adam
[1:22:01] was having dominion over everything and
[1:22:03] he didn't just do that just to show you
[1:22:05] and say well that's neat he did that to
[1:22:07] show you because I can do that with him
[1:22:09] I'm going to do it with you am mean as I
[1:22:11] did with the prophet I'll do with the
[1:22:12] bride I'll raise her up amen that every
[1:22:15] Spirit must be under her feet amen every
[1:22:17] enemy must be under her feet Hallelujah
[1:22:19] that it doesn't matter if it's anxiety
[1:22:21] put it under your feet if you're feeling
[1:22:23] stressed troubl don't worry about those
[1:22:25] things put it under your feet you have
[1:22:27] fear of tomorrow he'll be in the
[1:22:28] tomorrow if he's here today he'll be in
[1:22:31] the tomorrow he'll take care of you you
[1:22:33] don't need to get worried about anything
[1:22:34] that's a giving that trying to hinder
[1:22:36] your walk I say Satan get behind us in
[1:22:38] the name of Jesus Christ amen don't put
[1:22:40] up with him amen no we are here we've
[1:22:42] been
[1:22:44] awakened H we know in whom we have
[1:22:46] believed amen we're fully persuaded he's
[1:22:48] able to keep that which we have
[1:22:49] delivered unto him against that day
[1:22:51] what's that he's able to keep our souls
[1:22:53] I mean he's able to preserve us amen so
[1:22:55] don't let no gibeonite Spirit come in
[1:22:57] and put a fear upon you that it doesn't
[1:22:59] work it works amen this word is exactly
[1:23:02] the same as it was amen when Jesus spoke
[1:23:05] it or the prophet spoke it or when the
[1:23:06] prophet preached it it's the same word
[1:23:08] yes sir amen it hasn't changed one iot
[1:23:11] amen but the devil come along just like
[1:23:13] the Christian Science they say you know
[1:23:15] Jesus wasn't Divine and it's just Mind
[1:23:18] Over Matter that's a Gib andite Spirit
[1:23:21] Jesus was not just a prophet From
[1:23:22] Galilee that was God made flesh am me
[1:23:25] Paul said it was the blood of God that
[1:23:26] was shed wasn't just a we're not saved
[1:23:28] by Jewish blood Jesus wasn't Jew or
[1:23:31] Gentile he was God made flesh and it's
[1:23:34] not mind over matter friends it's not
[1:23:36] mind over matter that I can just think
[1:23:38] my way past these things no that's not
[1:23:40] faith faith is when God drops a
[1:23:42] revelation in your heart that it's going
[1:23:43] to happen and you can have walk you can
[1:23:45] have confidence and walk in that that's
[1:23:47] why the Rapture is a revelation am mean
[1:23:49] if God has revealed to you you're going
[1:23:51] in the Rapture you can walk in
[1:23:52] confidence you say I'm walking like he
[1:23:54] walking I mean cuz I saw the end of
[1:23:56] Enoch's walk was a translation and I'm
[1:23:58] going in the same thing and this message
[1:24:00] releases rapturing faith into a people
[1:24:03] he said well I've got to I've got to
[1:24:04] build up my faith now God's given you
[1:24:06] the faith I mean by the baptism of the
[1:24:08] Holy Ghost you can walk in confidence
[1:24:10] now you don't have to walk in fear and
[1:24:12] worry is it going to happen no it's rest
[1:24:14] assured it's going to happen H does that
[1:24:16] does that mean I just quit and be lazy
[1:24:18] no you press in with everything within
[1:24:19] you can you imagine Joshua's confidence
[1:24:22] he crosses the Jordan he sees Jero how's
[1:24:25] this going to happen the captain of the
[1:24:26] host of the Lord comes down God an
[1:24:27] Angelic form he says I've come to take
[1:24:29] over this battle can you imagine the
[1:24:31] confidence that he would have had after
[1:24:33] that visitation sure he was Moses
[1:24:35] Minister he saw many Supernatural things
[1:24:38] under Moses but this was a different age
[1:24:40] this was a different era they weren't in
[1:24:42] the desert anymore they were now going
[1:24:44] into the promised land so he needed more
[1:24:46] than a god of history and a testimony of
[1:24:48] yesterday he needed God to lead him from
[1:24:50] there all the way for the whole campaign
[1:24:52] amen that's why we can have confidence
[1:24:54] this word Works amen but the Gib likes
[1:24:57] to come along and say well yes the days
[1:24:59] of Miracles were there but they past we
[1:25:01] live in a different season we don't live
[1:25:03] in a different season we do not live in
[1:25:06] a different
[1:25:07] season you see this brother BR Fought
[1:25:10] The Same Spirit he said people would
[1:25:11] come to him and say we don't agree with
[1:25:14] you because you're trying to you're
[1:25:15] trying to restore an Apostolic age
[1:25:17] you're trying to project an Apostolic
[1:25:19] age to the people an Apostolic age was
[1:25:22] in the book of Acts where God lived in
[1:25:23] the people
[1:25:25] amen signs and wonders were done the
[1:25:27] word was fulfilled amen it was God
[1:25:29] leading his
[1:25:30] people and people try to tell them no
[1:25:32] those days cease with the apostles so
[1:25:35] you'd say well what about Paul cuz he
[1:25:36] wasn't part of the original group and
[1:25:38] but the Bible says no it continues on
[1:25:40] that's why I like it where he says here
[1:25:42] he says I pray thee my brother show me
[1:25:44] when the apostolic age ceased in the
[1:25:47] scripture show me where it ceased in the
[1:25:49] scripture cuz if you can go back in the
[1:25:51] scripture and you show no this age has
[1:25:53] never ceased amen it's for as many as
[1:25:55] the Lord Our God shall call amen so when
[1:25:58] did it cease if God is still calling
[1:26:00] then the apostolic age is still in
[1:26:02] session amen and that age is still in
[1:26:05] session we've got to realize that the
[1:26:06] same baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm I I
[1:26:09] contend for this a lot because the
[1:26:11] danger is if you read in the Book of
[1:26:13] Judges it comes there's a gener
[1:26:14] generation that comes and they don't
[1:26:16] know the Lord amen and so so there's a
[1:26:18] cycle of Revival under Joshua and the
[1:26:20] elders after Joshua but then when those
[1:26:22] who knew Joshua ceased then it says
[1:26:25] those ones didn't know the Lord then
[1:26:26] they went to a cycle of idolatry I think
[1:26:30] to me that's Insanity how on Earth can
[1:26:32] there are people be that know God and
[1:26:34] know people that know God and then comes
[1:26:36] that next Generation they don't know him
[1:26:37] at all so it comes from a fire of
[1:26:39] Revival that goes into just a message
[1:26:41] culture I pray God break that cycle May
[1:26:44] that never be doesn't matter how old or
[1:26:46] young we are new in the faith Whatever
[1:26:48] May there never be a age or or a
[1:26:50] generation that does not know their God
[1:26:52] that's just a culture and what we do and
[1:26:53] a learn by Behavior but may it always be
[1:26:55] a reality may it always be a Burning
[1:26:57] Flame in every heart amen that's why I'm
[1:26:59] very I'm very strong that we must know
[1:27:02] God in the power of his resurrection
[1:27:03] there must be a time where he lit your
[1:27:05] candle how he did it I don't know but
[1:27:07] there's got to be a change in your life
[1:27:09] it's got to be a difference something's
[1:27:10] got to happen hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:27:13] see because the Gibby not will come
[1:27:14] along with the first part of this um
[1:27:16] first part of this quote The Mystery of
[1:27:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:27:20] sensation so it's so it's without
[1:27:22] sensation so you don't even know you
[1:27:23] have it
[1:27:25] come but the person of Christ performing
[1:27:27] in you the same works that he did they
[1:27:28] always leave that off I tell you every
[1:27:31] woman that gets pregnant there comes a
[1:27:33] time when they know they're
[1:27:35] pregnant life begins to grow oh yes it's
[1:27:38] not like this near like nine months no
[1:27:40] but life their appetite changes how they
[1:27:42] walk changes their desires their even
[1:27:45] the things they like and don't like the
[1:27:46] food they once like they can't stand in
[1:27:48] all those things that's just a natural
[1:27:50] birth going to take place a natural a
[1:27:52] life has come into them it's changing
[1:27:53] how they live it should be the same
[1:27:55] thing with us sure maybe we can't know
[1:27:57] the day or the second or the hour where
[1:27:59] God came in but you should be look back
[1:28:01] in your life and say I was once this way
[1:28:03] and now I'm this way I mean maybe it was
[1:28:05] a very simple thing because it can't be
[1:28:07] without sensation but you see the life
[1:28:08] of God has come in where this is no
[1:28:11] longer stories amen it's no longer nice
[1:28:13] ideas am mean the the message isn't
[1:28:15] boring amen but the church isn't boring
[1:28:17] no more but it's a living reality amen
[1:28:20] and you see that same God come and
[1:28:21] living your life what's happened as the
[1:28:23] Holy Ghost has come in and what's
[1:28:25] happening the person of Christ is
[1:28:26] performing in you the same works that he
[1:28:28] did that's what he does amen hallelujah
[1:28:30] we could spend a bit of time on that but
[1:28:32] maybe we'll just keep going but you see
[1:28:33] now there is a there is a gibeonite
[1:28:36] spirit in the land saying basically just
[1:28:38] confess that brother Braham was a
[1:28:39] prophet and you got the Holy
[1:28:41] Ghost we do not say a sinner's prayer
[1:28:44] like that that doesn't that doesn't give
[1:28:47] you any eternal life acknowledging that
[1:28:49] God sent a prophet the devil
[1:28:51] acknowledges it he was defeated pray
[1:28:54] line after prayer line meeting after
[1:28:56] meeting he knows that that man was a
[1:28:58] prophet he knows that commission the
[1:29:00] angel gave him in the cave worked
[1:29:01] because he was defeated he knows it he
[1:29:04] believes it he's not our brother it
[1:29:07] doesn't give him eternal life if he
[1:29:09] stood here the devil stood here and had
[1:29:10] to tell the truth he would give you
[1:29:13] testimony after testimony of when he was
[1:29:15] cast out when his when his imps were
[1:29:17] defeated when different Spirits were
[1:29:18] cast out if he had to tell the truth and
[1:29:21] and and and if we asked him he said Do
[1:29:23] you believe he was Malachi 4 hits
[1:29:25] absolutely absolutely you
[1:29:29] see Hallelujah but you see now the
[1:29:32] problem is people come in with this
[1:29:34] Theory just acknowledge them the word is
[1:29:36] right and you've got it no you've got to
[1:29:39] have a fiery experience something's got
[1:29:41] to happen to you it's got to be like
[1:29:42] brother ad says like a light it's got to
[1:29:44] be like a candle you have a perfect
[1:29:46] candle the wax can be perfect the the
[1:29:48] wick and everything can be right but it
[1:29:50] takes a lighting of that candle
[1:29:52] something's got to happen like I said it
[1:29:53] could be a small could be a big thing
[1:29:54] but that candle there's got to be a
[1:29:56] light come on
[1:29:58] amen amen and because what is this now
[1:30:01] this is a Baptist gibeonite Spirit comes
[1:30:03] in and says you know we receive it when
[1:30:05] we
[1:30:07] believe you know the original they would
[1:30:09] argue with him say Well brother Braham
[1:30:11] no the original of Acts 19 May would
[1:30:13] just put that up you know the original
[1:30:15] is not have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:30:16] since you believe but it's have but but
[1:30:19] it says have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:30:21] when you believed right no the original
[1:30:23] is since that's right amen because
[1:30:25] there's always a process because it
[1:30:26] starts like I was saying where where a
[1:30:29] person doesn't believe the word is even
[1:30:30] true right but then God does a work in
[1:30:33] their heart takes that Stony heart out
[1:30:34] gives them a heart of Flesh then they
[1:30:36] believe the word is actually true they
[1:30:38] haven't had had the new birth yet but
[1:30:39] they're on their way right but then they
[1:30:42] can't live with one another fussing
[1:30:43] fighting trouble they can't even live
[1:30:45] with themselves and God gives them a new
[1:30:46] human Spirit I'm in Ezekiel 36 in case
[1:30:49] you're wondering yes there's a great
[1:30:51] change but that's not the finished thing
[1:30:53] but then God himself comes in and dwells
[1:30:55] within that new spirit then they walk in
[1:30:57] the word then they are
[1:30:59] believers amen but people want to say
[1:31:01] well it's we received it we received the
[1:31:04] Holy Ghost when we believe because it's
[1:31:05] without sensation no since you have
[1:31:09] believed there's got to be there's got
[1:31:11] to be a
[1:31:12] time when these things happen but you
[1:31:14] see
[1:31:15] now maybe I'll just maybe I'll just
[1:31:18] finish with this okay so I um I shared a
[1:31:21] few I shared a few um see give yanites
[1:31:24] are a problem I'm sure you've identified
[1:31:27] they're a problem I mean they will try
[1:31:29] and hinder you don't agree with them
[1:31:31] keep walking on and and and there's a
[1:31:33] few more maybe next time amen but you
[1:31:35] see as I shared a few uh probably a few
[1:31:38] months ago now about how I had a dream
[1:31:40] about a youth camp and there was and
[1:31:42] there was um and so it wasn't the Youth
[1:31:43] Camp you you guys went to wasn't there
[1:31:45] but but you know I was there at the
[1:31:47] youth camp and I don't know if I was a
[1:31:48] youth or a helper or something but but
[1:31:50] all the youth were standing in this big
[1:31:51] circle single single deep
[1:31:54] and brother Tim was there and he was
[1:31:56] preaching and he was part of the circle
[1:31:59] and he was preaching about you must
[1:32:00] receive your full inheritance you must
[1:32:02] receive the Holy Ghost it's more than
[1:32:03] just an intellectual understanding you
[1:32:05] must receive this full inheritance who
[1:32:07] wants this full inheritance and and when
[1:32:09] he was preaching he'd be walking back
[1:32:10] and forth like this and there's always a
[1:32:12] gap between him and the campers and so
[1:32:15] when he would Walk This Way the Gap
[1:32:16] would just stay there and he walk back
[1:32:17] this way everyone would move in unison
[1:32:19] like this and and he was giving an
[1:32:21] illustration look I'll give you a it's
[1:32:23] like you know the holy is like a token
[1:32:24] it's like a it's like a badge or
[1:32:26] something who wants this badge you held
[1:32:27] up like a wristband like an entry band
[1:32:29] thing just as an illustration and I was
[1:32:31] standing there thinking they won't even
[1:32:33] they won't even no one will even come up
[1:32:35] as the illustration and accept this band
[1:32:38] you know it wasn't it wasn't you know
[1:32:40] you know like an entry band like a
[1:32:41] swimming pool or somewhere you know or
[1:32:42] you got to laugh Lots or whatever
[1:32:44] depends on what age you are but you know
[1:32:45] you know what I mean no one would even
[1:32:47] accept it as an illustration I that's
[1:32:49] ridiculous so I walked up to him I want
[1:32:51] my full inheritance you know and then
[1:32:53] amen and then um I want my full
[1:32:55] inheritance you know but then there was
[1:32:58] a bit where there's all these youth in
[1:32:59] this like this Grand standand playing
[1:33:00] instruments there was this one one one
[1:33:02] young lady and her and her dress was the
[1:33:04] same color as her instrument and she's
[1:33:06] playing an instrument normally it's just
[1:33:07] a wooden color it's not color but it was
[1:33:09] all black and white same patn everything
[1:33:11] just and she was trying so hard to be
[1:33:13] noticed and then the Lord said to me the
[1:33:15] reason for these things is because
[1:33:17] because it's carnality where where where
[1:33:20] people like this have not received as
[1:33:23] the prophet saw a vision of preaching
[1:33:25] about how how how brother BR saw a saw a
[1:33:28] vision and he speaks about a blasphemy
[1:33:30] Blasphemous names also from the vision
[1:33:33] um from the Lord where brother Braham is
[1:33:34] standing in the sun preaching and
[1:33:36] there's this big forested area and
[1:33:38] people are in the forest and some people
[1:33:40] are standing in Shadow and and some
[1:33:42] people are standing in the sunlight and
[1:33:44] so and a gibon is like a tree that
[1:33:46] covers you from the sunlight yeah right
[1:33:49] you got to cut those things all it it
[1:33:50] hinders your walks he said some people
[1:33:52] receive the sunlight of the Gospel
[1:33:53] others were standing behind trees and he
[1:33:55] said he had two great CL climaxes in his
[1:33:58] service and then so he said he was
[1:34:00] preaching way he was preaching so long
[1:34:02] that people begin to say well I'm hungry
[1:34:04] and young married couples would walk
[1:34:05] away in different things and looking for
[1:34:07] natural food and he said he's just
[1:34:09] coming to his great big climax saying
[1:34:10] saying everything I've taught you is in
[1:34:12] the word of God that was his great big
[1:34:14] climax all the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:16] all the realities of God it's all from
[1:34:18] the word but but the Lord said you'll
[1:34:21] have two great climaxes in this message
[1:34:24] he knew the people would come back again
[1:34:26] and then he would say that his second
[1:34:28] great big climax is when the angels of
[1:34:30] the Lord would come to him and would and
[1:34:32] would um open the Seven Seals or tell
[1:34:34] them to go back to Jeffersonville and
[1:34:35] preach the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:34:37] now as I said in the start of my service
[1:34:39] the opening of The Seven Seals brings
[1:34:41] Christ back into the people am right so
[1:34:43] in my dream the Lord told me or or
[1:34:46] someone told me the reason of this
[1:34:47] carnality is because people have not
[1:34:49] stayed for the Second Great climax they
[1:34:52] have not received the baptism of the
[1:34:53] ghost you see and that's why it's so
[1:34:55] essential don't just grow up in church
[1:34:57] amen don't just be part of a group you
[1:34:59] know him personally amen don't just
[1:35:02] don't don't just become part of a
[1:35:03] movement or this is what my parents do
[1:35:06] now this is what I do but may God become
[1:35:08] real may he become personal to each and
[1:35:11] every one of us because if he does
[1:35:13] become personal amen then what happens
[1:35:15] is the voice of the shepherd will always
[1:35:18] speak when a Gibby Knight tries to come
[1:35:21] right and if you listen to his voice you
[1:35:23] won't agree with the gibeonite doesn't
[1:35:25] matter how much that gibeonite will
[1:35:27] agree with your your first nature like I
[1:35:30] said some gibeonites come legalistically
[1:35:32] and people are naturally legalistic
[1:35:33] they'll naturally gravitate their way
[1:35:35] they naturally gravitate a liberal way
[1:35:37] but if you're listening to the voice of
[1:35:38] the shepherd you'll stay down the middle
[1:35:40] I mean you won't listen to that gibon
[1:35:42] not amen if a gibot comes along tries to
[1:35:44] make you fanatical or deep and Scully
[1:35:46] and cold and formal you won't listen to
[1:35:48] those things amen there's also another
[1:35:50] gibon in the land that says that you've
[1:35:52] got to you've got to you know you can't
[1:35:55] just get the Holy Ghost straight away
[1:35:56] but you've got to mature you need all
[1:35:58] the virtues of the statute of the
[1:35:59] perfect man then you receive the Holy
[1:36:01] Ghost now the Holy Ghost puts the
[1:36:02] virtues in you right so it's not it's so
[1:36:05] it's not a it's not a you know it's not
[1:36:08] a workspace program where you earn the
[1:36:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost like the devil
[1:36:13] had me on this hamster wheel or roller
[1:36:15] coaster for
[1:36:16] years said if you're good enough for
[1:36:19] long enough then you earn it that's not
[1:36:22] how it works it's not it's not human
[1:36:25] ability that that that that gives you
[1:36:27] the promise it's just surrendering to
[1:36:29] the promise and letting him
[1:36:32] live amen but if you but a gibon comes
[1:36:35] along and tries to make you think well
[1:36:36] you have to earn it we don't have to
[1:36:38] earn nothing the Lord earned it all
[1:36:40] believe it receive it surrender to it
[1:36:42] let him live I mean you say well that's
[1:36:44] too simple no that's that's the gospel
[1:36:47] it's not a complicated thing you see see
[1:36:50] this is what brother bam says and and I
[1:36:52] will finish here he says now works are
[1:36:53] fine but they don't save you they don't
[1:36:55] make you perfect it's Christ or perish
[1:36:58] and it is not even Christ and works it
[1:37:00] is Christ Alone see GI will say it's
[1:37:02] your it's Christ and your Works see have
[1:37:04] you done enough have you done this
[1:37:06] enough no just believe the Lord Jesus
[1:37:07] Christ it is Christ Alone this age began
[1:37:10] the years of Armenian ISM now this is
[1:37:12] the Methodist era that does not believe
[1:37:15] in Christ as the reality it does not
[1:37:18] sing nothing but the blood for it sings
[1:37:20] nothing but the blood and my own conduct
[1:37:22] now I believe in Good Conduct if you are
[1:37:24] saved you will do righteously we have
[1:37:26] already gone over that but let me tell
[1:37:28] you now salvation is not Jesus plus it
[1:37:30] is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord
[1:37:32] from start to finish it's all God let
[1:37:35] his life be in me let his blood so have
[1:37:38] I no just afraid I've missed something
