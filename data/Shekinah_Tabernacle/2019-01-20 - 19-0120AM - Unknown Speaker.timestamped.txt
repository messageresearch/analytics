[57:13] and my people shall never be ashamed
[57:15] maybe God this reading of his word you
[57:18] may be seated in the presence of God I
[57:21] just want to read the scripture here in
[57:24] the book of Ephesians which is a little
[57:27] bit what I wanna speak on this morning
[57:32] in chapter 5 verse 25 and I'm not going
[57:37] to talk about marriage husband love your
[57:39] wives
[57:39] you should know that I don't have to
[57:43] tell you that amen husband love your
[57:46] wives even as Christ also loved the
[57:49] church and gave himself for it that he
[57:53] may sanctify and cleanse it with the
[57:56] washing of the water by the word verse
[57:59] 27 that he may present it to himself
[58:03] a glorious church not having spot or
[58:07] wrinkle or any such thing but it should
[58:12] be holy and without blemish and they god
[58:15] bless the reading of his word to our
[58:17] hearts I was listening to that song Kim
[58:20] and Amy was saying how big my god is
[58:23] amen and I was listening to a minister
[58:25] the other day and it was saying that God
[58:28] he's a good God but then he added
[58:31] something that took my attention he says
[58:33] that's only an aspect God is a good god
[58:38] that's only an aspect of God that's not
[58:42] God that's an aspect of God the same as
[58:47] we say God is a healer that's an aspect
[58:49] of who he is but brother my God is
[58:53] greater than that my god is mightier
[58:56] than that Bible says brother that he set
[58:59] on the room of the earth
[59:00] he made an amazing earth his footstool
[59:04] my god sits on the room of the earth and
[59:07] brother and his feet is upon this world
[59:10] and that's his footstool my God is big
[59:14] hallelujah and brother is so big but yet
[59:17] so little we can look within our hearts
[59:20] how big is our God how big is his name
[59:24] is the mighty one he's forever the same
[59:26] he hold of the waters brother I thank
[59:30] God that I know him hallelujah
[59:33] came to know him in 1960 make some make
[59:38] some sums hallelujah but you know I
[59:42] thank God this morning and I can speak
[59:44] on a little thought this morning God has
[59:48] predestinated for himself a glorious
[59:51] Holy Ghost fell Church right here in
[59:55] hell rather to challenge the devil
[1:00:02] that's why I'm here he's ordained before
[1:00:06] this hour and this season and this time
[1:00:09] rather he has ordained me to give the
[1:00:12] devil nightmares
[1:00:13] [Applause]
[1:00:16] every time he sees you every time you
[1:00:19] roll out of bed
[1:00:20] then he scuttles and he runs and he is
[1:00:24] coward because why a son of God and a
[1:00:27] daughter of God hallelujah is back on
[1:00:30] their feet
[1:00:31] so doesn't matter brother this morning
[1:00:33] what you look like doesn't matter how
[1:00:35] you feel God's Word says he's can I have
[1:00:39] a bride he's gonna have a bride brother
[1:00:43] and I'm so grateful this morning and
[1:00:46] part of that bride but the man says in
[1:00:48] questions in answers and in the message
[1:00:50] law having grace law having a shadow and
[1:00:53] he says his words he says remember
[1:00:56] friend this glorious church that we have
[1:01:01] been talking about this last week he
[1:01:04] says why can't we have it yeah 113
[1:01:09] George Street Stokes Valley no heart I
[1:01:17] challenge you if that church has been
[1:01:20] predestinated to be a why can't it be
[1:01:25] why can't it be a hallelujah he says
[1:01:30] we've got the qualifications we've got
[1:01:34] the people who love God don't you
[1:01:38] believe that hallelujah now wouldn't you
[1:01:42] like to have a real Bible Church that's
[1:01:45] a question where the venom is asking now
[1:01:47] wouldn't you like to have a real Bible
[1:01:50] Church hallelujah a real Bible Church
[1:01:54] where all the spiritual gifts were set
[1:01:58] in order everything making manifest just
[1:02:02] exactly the way it should be wouldn't

[1:02:41] will have to make some sacrifices amen
[1:02:44] not money he says you're going to have
[1:02:48] to sacrifice what some of your own ideas
[1:02:52] you're going to have to sacrifice
[1:02:55] something you're sometimes in prayer
[1:02:58] that's a very scarce commodity they ever
[1:03:02] ever ever the enemy attacks you he's
[1:03:05] attacking you right there in your prayer
[1:03:08] life you know pray lie but that's why he
[1:03:12] attacks you and that doesn't matter who
[1:03:15] we are he attacks us hallelujah
[1:03:30] Thank You amen so he attacks you on our
[1:03:34] prayer life and brother BAM says you're
[1:03:36] going to sacrifice some time in prayer
[1:03:39] you're going to have to maybe sacrifice
[1:03:42] your stubborn wall to great gun humility
[1:03:48] he says you're going to have to
[1:03:51] sacrifice he says the whole Christian
[1:03:54] move is cross brother he says is
[1:03:58] sacrificial opens a church to serve God
[1:04:04] to serve God to really serve God
[1:04:08] hallelujah is not for sissies not for
[1:04:15] sissies is not for those with a weak
[1:04:17] backbone take some men and some woman to
[1:04:24] serve God to say no to say no I'm not
[1:04:31] gonna do it
[1:04:33] That's not me rather that's kind of
[1:04:37] person that God can rely and depend upon
[1:04:42] not some wishy-washy we can all quote we
[1:04:46] can all sing our hymns we can all say we
[1:04:49] are baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:04:50] Jesus Christ brother that's easy to say
[1:04:53] that but when it comes to when the
[1:04:56] rubber hits the road when you have to
[1:04:59] say no hallelujah when the ones you hang
[1:05:03] out with try to get you away try to make
[1:05:07] you to compromise on your principles God
[1:05:11] is calling such men and women that can
[1:05:15] stand and having done all to stand
[1:05:19] then stand having your loins girded
[1:05:23] about with truth rather having the full
[1:05:27] armor of God on that's the only way that
[1:05:32] me and you all be able to overcome and
[1:05:35] live a victorious life daily we can

[1:07:59] church that this church may become
[1:08:03] perfected in the love of Christ that
[1:08:06] this will be a place that people will
[1:08:10] come from around the world to come in

[1:08:18] harmony of the Spirit you have to say
[1:08:24] that this church in stoke Valley it's

[1:08:55] devil don't care how high you jump
[1:08:58] doesn't care how much you scream doesn't

[1:09:32] shout that's part of it emotions that
[1:09:36] part of it
[1:09:37] sobbing and boohoo that's part of it but
[1:09:40] when you walk away from this if I don't
[1:09:44] live right brother then that's all in
[1:09:46] vain hallelujah hallelujah you know what
[1:09:51] brother BAM says when the Holy Ghost
[1:09:53] poured out on the day of Pentecost I
[1:09:57] mean it poured out on the day of
[1:09:59] Pentecost he says the devil was lying on
[1:10:02] his back
[1:10:03] nice cross cigarette in his mouth that
[1:10:09] didn't disturb him when they were
[1:10:11] carrying on and drunken was wine and
[1:10:15] brother but when the man at the temple
[1:10:19] beautiful hallelujah when that man at
[1:10:24] the temple beautiful received his
[1:10:27] healing that is when the devil sat up
[1:10:31] and took notice hallelujah why because
[1:10:36] it was another people doing what they
[1:10:39] mastered it and he thought he thought
[1:10:46] that he did away with that when they
[1:10:49] crucified Christ and buried him he
[1:10:52] thought it was over the Bible says if
[1:10:55] only he knew that when he crucified the
[1:10:59] Prince of Peace if only he knew that out
[1:11:03] of that death burial there was going to
[1:11:06] be a resurrection and me and our youth a
[1:11:09] merely you he never knew when he
[1:11:13] crucified Christ never knew that he was

[1:11:46] sinners will walk into the building and
[1:11:50] the Holy Spirit will be so dominating in
[1:11:54] here
[1:11:55] though they were weeping and walk up to
[1:11:58] the altar and give their lives to Christ
[1:12:02] brother that is the church that is
[1:12:07] coming for not a church that quote not
[1:12:11] the church that can give you the volumes
[1:12:14] and the years and the books

[1:12:38] the atmosphere right

[1:12:57] does when God does things in my life and

[1:13:12] world may know that Jesus Christ has
[1:13:16] raised from the dead and loving today
[1:13:19] amongst his people praise the Lord amen
[1:13:22] amen hallelujah got a quote here from
[1:13:26] I'm talking the resume of the church
[1:13:28] ages now this is gonna be the church
[1:13:32] that's gonna be yeah hallelujah
[1:13:35] this church is not going to be like the
[1:13:38] Ephesians church well though brother
[1:13:40] brand says he's restoring us back
[1:13:42] there's going to be another Ephesians in
[1:13:45] notice here quote there's maybe another
[1:13:48] Ephesians but brother Wayne this church
[1:13:51] come to its pinnacle it's gonna be like
[1:13:54] it wasn't after Pentecost he says now
[1:13:58] the birth of the church was at Pentecost
[1:14:01] he said as the first Adam was given a
[1:14:04] bride fresh from the hand of God and was
[1:14:08] undefiled for a brief span so was Christ
[1:14:14] the last Adam given a bride pure and
[1:14:18] fresh
[1:14:19] I think occurs
[1:14:21] and she remains separate and undefiled
[1:14:26] for some time the Bible says how long
[1:14:30] after Pentecost how about the people we
[1:14:36] know the people lived off the Pentecost
[1:14:38] we're not talking higher the first
[1:14:41] church page because brother BAM says
[1:14:43] when that first church age Ephesians
[1:14:46] came on the scene she was a ready a
[1:14:49] fallen woman she was already defiled so
[1:14:53] somewhere between the birth of the
[1:14:57] ephesian church age and Pentecost there
[1:15:01] was a span of time then that the bride
[1:15:04] was really manifesting what Christ was
[1:15:11] there was love program says that when
[1:15:16] someone heard that a brother or a sister
[1:15:19] was taken captive he said the believer
[1:15:23] said let us go down to them and die with
[1:15:28] him that was the love that was between
[1:15:33] that period and brother Branham says he
[1:15:35] doesn't know for how long that space was
[1:15:39] that a church that was birthed at
[1:15:42] Pentecost live and undefiled life but
[1:15:48] somewhere the enemy slip him so this
[1:15:54] little church does bride it we are
[1:15:56] talking about this morning when God is
[1:15:59] going to fully display his power in her
[1:16:03] she will not going to be like a defeated
[1:16:06] search page because the official church
[1:16:09] age I have somewhat against you you've
[1:16:14] left your first love but not this bride
[1:16:18] brother when she comes to the pinnacle
[1:16:22] regard expresses himself in his fullness
[1:16:26] in her must remember that that dead
[1:16:29] bride we're talking about the Bible says
[1:16:32] that no man
[1:16:34] just add himself to that church people
[1:16:39] were fearful to come beyond the doors of
[1:16:44] the church people were fearful because
[1:16:47] of the gifts because of the power of God
[1:16:51] because of the Holy Ghost calling out
[1:16:54] son
[1:16:55] this is what I'm praying our church that
[1:16:58] God that you will even if you call out
[1:17:00] my name but one thing I know then you
[1:17:03] know about me God you're aware of me
[1:17:07] that's why you calling my name
[1:17:09] ready I'm what pleased with you and I
[1:17:15] know brother he knows about me and the
[1:17:18] prophet of God see that's the kind of
[1:17:20] church he's gonna have just before the
[1:17:22] rapture just before the rapture we're
[1:17:26] gonna have that kind of church we can
[1:17:27] have that kind of people hallelu because
[1:17:31] that is the church brother that he's
[1:17:33] ordained for himself she will burn out
[1:17:36] sparks without wrinkle without blemish
[1:17:39] without any such things that's the
[1:17:41] church brother hallelujah and he says
[1:17:44] and the Lord added to that church daily
[1:17:47] that should be say this is how long this
[1:17:50] continued we do not know but one day
[1:17:53] even as he was tempted and seduced by
[1:17:56] Satan
[1:17:57] so this glorious wonderful church was
[1:18:01] contaminated by the ant entrance of the
[1:18:05] Antichrist spirit the brother BAM says
[1:18:09] that Antichrist spirit will manifest
[1:18:11] himself in three manners will make a
[1:18:14] former will make you powerless will make
[1:18:18] you look 1 now you have to decide in
[1:18:21] your life right now
[1:18:23] where do you forget where do you 50
[1:18:28] formal countries your hands can't say
[1:18:32] Amen
[1:18:33] don't tell me brother that's your nature
[1:18:36] your nature should have been changed
[1:18:41] don't tell me that's the work that's the
[1:18:43] way you are no you can't tell me that
[1:18:46] you can't raise your hands and worship
[1:18:50] God then an antichrist spirit I scraped
[1:18:53] into your life if you are powerless
[1:18:57] Antichrist spirit if you are powerless
[1:19:00] that you don't have power to withstand
[1:19:04] the enemy you don't have power brother
[1:19:08] to say no Antichrist spirit I scraped in
[1:19:12] I still come to church
[1:19:16] I still love brother Branham but brother
[1:19:19] if you are powerless where God has
[1:19:24] ordained you to be powerful and you are
[1:19:29] powerless and the enemy overrides you
[1:19:32] and the enemy gets you to brother to do
[1:19:35] what he wants you to do then the
[1:19:38] Antichrist spirit look one look one they
[1:19:47] want to go there brother
[1:19:48] but do you know each one of us know how
[1:19:52] I was ten years ago when I first saw the
[1:19:56] light and what I am now
[1:20:00] each one of us know right now how my
[1:20:05] life is with God my standing and if I'm
[1:20:10] just on fire for God as I was in 1960 am
[1:20:16] I still on fire for God am I still just
[1:20:21] as enthused with God as I was yeah this
[1:20:29] is the hour that we living in
[1:20:31] I mean I feel sorry for our young people
[1:20:34] truly do because I have an idea what you
[1:20:40] go through I miss a posture you talk to
[1:20:43] young men and you deal with him and you
[1:20:45] realize the challenges they face but God
[1:20:49] is able it does not matter what the
[1:20:55] devil throws at you

[1:21:02] God is able to keep me clean God is able
[1:21:08] to keep me unspotted from the world God
[1:21:12] is able to keep me holy because the holy
[1:21:15] God living in me hallelujah church we
[1:21:21] are talking this morning about a bride
[1:21:24] of Jesus Christ that's what we're
[1:21:28] talking about this morning and she is
[1:21:30] going to walk upon this earth brother
[1:21:32] before the rapture before the rapture
[1:21:36] she's gonna the Beast displayed she
[1:21:39] don't need to be displayed after the
[1:21:41] rapture but before the rapture this
[1:21:44] world will once again feel the shaking
[1:21:49] feel the vibration of a little bride
[1:21:53] she's not much to look at
[1:21:56] she might not be even be great in
[1:21:59] numbers but she is going to shake this
[1:22:03] world once more why do you think the
[1:22:06] enemy is trying to make you look 1 why
[1:22:11] is he trying to inject because no one of
[1:22:14] us are immune to the odors here there's
[1:22:19] not one of us

[1:27:13] with your shoulder to his shoulder and
[1:27:17] stand in the presence of God our Father
[1:27:22] away a prayer should be made in the
[1:27:25] presence of God and say father here's my
[1:27:30] brother he justly deserves punishment
[1:27:35] because he has done me evil and I don't
[1:27:39] see why he did it then let God go to
[1:27:45] talking to you you're standing out with
[1:27:50] your brother or your sister in the
[1:27:53] presence of God
[1:27:55] shoulder to shoulder

[1:28:03] with him shoulder to shoulder and say
[1:28:05] Lord my brother my sister has done me

[1:28:15] but he's done me evil name brother brems
[1:28:19] is you God lifts you tell him what your
[1:28:23] brother or your sister has done then
[1:28:27] brother Sam brother branches after you
[1:28:31] have spat out your accusations and what
[1:28:37] is done brother Burns is now let God
[1:28:41] talk to you
[1:28:44] let God now tell you about that man's
[1:28:48] life how he grew up how he was abused
[1:28:54] how he was treated in his youth how he
[1:28:57] was scarred but the band says leave God
[1:28:59] now tell you about this man
[1:29:05] and why the devil is twist-up posted him
[1:29:10] up and caused him to do that though is
[1:29:14] absolutely wrong before you leave the
[1:29:17] throne of God
[1:29:18] you'll be speech you will be feeling
[1:29:20] sorry for that man before you leave the
[1:29:24] throne of God you will feel sorry for
[1:29:26] that man and you will be sympathizing
[1:29:29] with that brother now listen to this and
[1:29:31] when you get back down to earth again
[1:29:36] where were you with your brother your
[1:29:40] brother brems is when you get back down
[1:29:44] to earth again so you couldn't have been
[1:29:47] here you had to be up of prayer and
[1:29:53] intercession to be able to stand with
[1:29:58] somebody that's hurt you that broke your
[1:30:01] influence that destroyed your character
[1:30:09] this is when you get back down again to
[1:30:12] earth you'll go over to that brother
[1:30:15] shake his hand because you know what
[1:30:19] he's been through he says you can't
[1:30:22] stand with a mortal in the presence of
[1:30:24] God and condemned anybody this is I
[1:30:31] don't believe that even if he is a rank
[1:30:34] son now you realize why brother Branham
[1:30:41] says in teaching on Moses if you have
[1:30:44] ought against sinner or saint you are in
[1:30:48] danger of hellfire
[1:30:50] amen brother Anini Sunnah or st. you see
[1:30:56] many time we treat Sunnis different to
[1:31:00] what we treat brothers yet they should
[1:31:04] be no distinction
[1:31:06] we shouldn't actual fact loved a sinner
[1:31:08] more than we love a saint
[1:31:11] loving a saint that just happens you'll
[1:31:14] just love him but to love a guy where
[1:31:18] the babes is when a guy insult your wife
[1:31:22] many time I think of these things and
[1:31:26] you realize you reminder how will you
[1:31:28] react how will you react that's the
[1:31:32] reason why Paul speaks about first
[1:31:36] Corinthians 30th
[1:31:40] it doesn't call it love cause a charity
[1:31:45] because that is something else that you
[1:31:49] can love Bible says charity is
[1:31:54] long-suffering
[1:31:58] me and you our charity can go so far
[1:32:03] just might go far but there's gonna come
[1:32:08] an end to my annual charity and then we
[1:32:13] are going to react can I hear amen we
[1:32:22] are going to react and many times we
[1:32:26] react in a very unchristian manner
[1:32:30] because the prophet of God is with the
[1:32:33] Holy Ghost now I want to let you know
[1:32:35] what the Holy Ghost you and I are
[1:32:40] shackled to an outside guy
[1:32:44] we are shackled to a flesh guy this
[1:32:47] flesh guy hasn't got the Holy Ghost this
[1:32:52] flesh guy brother he hasn't got the Holy
[1:32:55] Ghost this flesh guy has got the ability
[1:32:57] to rise up and to be very unkind what
[1:33:07] the Holy Ghost this flesh guy has the
[1:33:13] ability brother to be angry that's what
[1:33:19] I many times says brother if the split
[1:33:21] guy is not brought into subjection to
[1:33:26] the inner man this flesh guy can push
[1:33:29] you so far that you can kill someone
[1:33:34] what the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost
[1:33:42] got you some mind battles now I got some
[1:33:46] mind because how can it be what the
[1:33:48] whole brother branham's is that snake
[1:33:50] nature it's with you when you receive
[1:33:54] the Holy Ghost he says you and I are two
[1:33:57] people they sir there's a hateful guy
[1:34:04] this guy really is hateful is mean gets
[1:34:10] angry this guy this guy almost caused me
[1:34:16] to kinamania in New Zealand
[1:34:18] this guy this guy I can push you beyond
[1:34:26] the boundaries if you don't let this guy
[1:34:30] be brought under subjection to this guy
[1:34:34] inside of you
[1:34:40] what cause brother branham to pull a gun
[1:34:43] it I'm gonna kill someone did they have
[1:34:48] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:52] what cause Dee
[1:34:56] so me and you Church shackled to the
[1:35:00] dead man shackled to this guy this guy
[1:35:03] you bring him to church be such next to
[1:35:08] it to you and you wanna worship and this
[1:35:11] guy keeps your arm down
[1:35:16] this guy doesn't feel like worshiping
[1:35:20] this guy doesn't feel like saying Amen
[1:35:25] this guy don't want to do anything to
[1:35:29] help to further the kingdom of God this
[1:35:34] guy is always the guy brother when you
[1:35:38] ask him to do anything for the things of
[1:35:40] God he's always got an excuse this guy
[1:35:46] this guy like Paul Paul in prison was
[1:35:53] shackled to a person a god that watched
[1:35:58] over him and that person you just have
[1:36:03] to read the history that person was with
[1:36:06] Paul all the time
[1:36:09] when Paul had to write then that guy was
[1:36:14] there that's why they called the book of
[1:36:18] it Philippians the bow of the clanging
[1:36:19] chains when Paul write it I might know
[1:36:22] him when Paul wrote those precious
[1:36:26] things brother he was shackled to what a
[1:36:32] god that kept him so in Paul want to
[1:36:35] worship he had to fight with this God to
[1:36:39] raise his arms likewise in church this
[1:36:45] guy keeps you from really doing for God
[1:36:50] what the inner man wants to do so you

[1:43:32] our young people are going to uni some
[1:43:34] of our young people are going to high
[1:43:35] school and we're gonna find out if we
[1:43:39] you know this one thing I've learned
[1:43:41] brother been I've come to realize that
[1:43:42] we have not prepared our children for
[1:43:45] life we prepared them for the rapture we
[1:43:49] talking about the rapture have you
[1:43:52] prepared your child for the world to
[1:43:56] face the real world to face unreal
[1:44:00] devils out there that's the reason why
[1:44:04] our kids go under because we have not
[1:44:08] prepared them for the Odyssey of spirits
[1:44:12] we have not prepared our children for
[1:44:15] peer pressure we have not prepared our
[1:44:19] people children our young people in our
[1:44:22] church but they're gonna face some real
[1:44:26] devils out there we haven't prepared
[1:44:30] them we spoke about the rapture we spoke
[1:44:35] about the changing of the body but what
[1:44:37] about waiting as we wait for the rapture
[1:44:42] how I ought to live how am I supposed to
[1:44:45] walk how am I supposed to overcome
[1:44:48] brother bin when I face the world how do
[1:44:51] I overcome give me a quote no can take
[1:44:57] him say come let's pray
[1:44:59] let me intercede with you but I'm
[1:45:05] telling you our young children are being
[1:45:07] swallowed by the world they've been
[1:45:13] destroyed by the world I think somebody
[1:45:18] said I think brother Armand told me
[1:45:20] someone to go and taste the world to get
[1:45:25] a taste of money I can take off my shirt
[1:45:30] I can show you the scars from going to
[1:45:33] try and taste the world to have a
[1:45:36] testimony your testimony is that you can
[1:45:42] overcome in the face of all the forth
[1:45:47] that you are facing you can overcome it
[1:45:50] you can stand strong where the others
[1:45:55] are going under your standing I'm
[1:46:01] talking about loving daily as an
[1:46:06] overcomer praying with your children
[1:46:16] your wife bring your wife your wife is
[1:46:24] the only one that know you when you
[1:46:27] stand there in the pulpit my wife is the
[1:46:31] only one that knows me I'm living with
[1:46:35] my son and my two granddaughters in my
[1:46:37] home I'm living with him and I'm the
[1:46:41] pastor and I am the granddad they have
[1:46:47] to listen to me preaching and I need to
[1:46:51] make sure that they are not offended of
[1:46:55] me preaching something that I'm fighting
[1:46:58] with my wife I'm always at loggerheads
[1:47:00] with anybody I need to love and if
[1:47:08] you're a pastor's child your life is
[1:47:11] hell because your children by the bend
[1:47:16] when they grow up everybody's gonna look
[1:47:19] at them they're gonna judge you and your
[1:47:22] wife by the a Bahamian ministers behind
[1:47:27] this pulpit
[1:47:29] they are watching your family brother in
[1:47:33] the church yes in the church because in
[1:47:40] the church you have three kinds of
[1:47:41] believers we need to be honest we need
[1:47:44] to so loving this message it's not easy
[1:47:54] it's not easy living what Malachi 4 said
[1:47:58] how he ought to live that ye believe all
[1:48:03] could say my dad treated the believe the
[1:48:07] friends and if there's any enemies the
[1:48:11] same they didn't know who was his
[1:48:14] friends or his enemies Billy Paul
[1:48:17] related an incident with his dad passed
[1:48:20] through a border control anything to
[1:48:24] declare
[1:48:24] I don't have anything to declare and
[1:48:27] when brother Berengar at home as he was
[1:48:32] unpacking he saw pack of peanuts or nuts
[1:48:35] he says Billy I say to the gentleman I
[1:48:39] have nothing to declare
[1:48:41] and look at this he said propose it my
[1:48:44] dad drove back those miles to go and to
[1:48:48] declare that pack of the nuts and all
[1:48:51] that guy did when you got the nuts just
[1:48:53] rooting the dirt but are we there
[1:49:01] because that was the first fruits that
[1:49:04] was woven as an acceptance that is more
[1:49:10] like william branham in the field coming
[1:49:14] to maturity
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:18] Paul said be a follower of me as i am a
[1:49:22] follower of christ so I can also say I'm
[1:49:25] following william branham because he is
[1:49:28] the one that's going to stand heard them
[1:49:33] talk about behind the curtain of time or
[1:49:36] these or branham's know who they're your
[1:49:38] converts and an algorithm animals quit
[1:49:43] ask the question man with Paul's
[1:49:45] believers will Paul have to stand he
[1:49:47] said yeah Paul have to stand also the
[1:49:51] program says well I'm so glad I preached
[1:49:54] exactly what Paul preached and the host
[1:49:57] screamed we are resting on that and I'm
[1:50:00] resting on this message brother I tell
[1:50:04] you I I don't know where I would have
[1:50:06] been if it wasn't for this message I
[1:50:09] don't know where I would have been if it
[1:50:11] wasn't for this message if you haven't
[1:50:13] fallen in love with this message you
[1:50:17] know I'm going to tell you friend you
[1:50:18] ain't gonna stand there's many many
[1:50:22] that's walked away from this message I'm
[1:50:26] finishing up this many many that preach
[1:50:37] this message what caused them to walk
[1:50:41] away after years standing for this
[1:50:45] message and not walking away and listen
[1:50:50] they did they not only walking away they
[1:50:53] going into the world
[1:50:54] I saw a brother a picture was senior
[1:51:00] showed me a brother that was a pastor
[1:51:04] that had a website it had a massive
[1:51:07] church sitting in a short brother beam
[1:51:11] with a beer you see I've got no problem
[1:51:17] leaving the message if you haven't got
[1:51:20] the revelation but at least if Christ
[1:51:23] has done something in your life find
[1:51:26] yourself another church but no they
[1:51:29] don't they go into the world I saw a
[1:51:35] picture of that same brothers family
[1:51:38] here cut gothic black lipstick here wood
[1:51:44] streets in short-sleeve what has
[1:51:50] happened this message never became real
[1:51:55] it was all little all teaching beautiful
[1:51:58] teachings but it never became real it
[1:52:00] never became their life that's why I say
[1:52:04] this morning that this message must
[1:52:07] because this message is Christ this is
[1:52:10] Christ I'm supposed to become him I'm
[1:52:16] supposed to become this message I'm
[1:52:18] supposed to become Christ hallelujah

[1:52:49] is the church that they're going to fly
[1:52:51] from all over the world hungry hearts to
[1:52:55] come and see what's happening here where
[1:53:01] the seven thunders of Revelation 10

[1:53:25] hundred fifty seven oh four oh seven the
[1:53:28] morning remembers now ministering God
[1:53:31] keeps his word and he says I believe
[1:53:34] this coming a time is this Paul said
[1:53:37] where there was prophecies it shall fail
[1:53:39] where there is tongues they shall cease
[1:53:42] he says I believe it's coming a time
[1:53:44] when the Saints will get together like
[1:53:47] this listen to this quilty when the
[1:53:51] Saints will get together like this and
[1:53:53] just a love Spirit will just sweep over
[1:53:57] the audience and just every person in
[1:54:01] there oh that's wrong will be taken out
[1:54:06] and the dead presence under that love
[1:54:10] spirit all that's wrong will be taken
[1:54:13] out he said it will be such a presence
[1:54:17] of the Holy Ghost he says I believe why

[1:54:23] for them now it's a contact maybe of a
[1:54:26] minister anointed and laying hands on

[1:54:42] that where the Saints will sit together
