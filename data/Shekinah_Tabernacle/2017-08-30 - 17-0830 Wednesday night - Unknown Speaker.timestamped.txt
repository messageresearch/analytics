[23:26] with you it's always good to be together
[23:29] when we worship the Lord in one Accord
[23:32] of one mind of one spirit something has
[23:35] to happen
[23:36] amen just as we stand I'd like to read
[23:40] the Word of God I've got quite a few
[23:42] scriptures but I start with one thought
[23:45] to begin with x.25 and I read from verse
[23:51] 17 to verse 19
[23:56] that's when Paul was before Festus when
[24:02] he was a prisoner and here it says in
[24:06] verse 17 therefore when they were come
[24:11] hither without any delay on the morrow I
[24:15] set on the judgement seat and commanded
[24:18] the main to be brought forth against
[24:22] whom when he accuses stood up they
[24:25] brought none accusation of such things
[24:28] as I supposed but had certain questions
[24:34] against him of their own superstition or
[24:37] religion and of one Jesus which was dead
[24:43] who Paul affirmed to be alive let's just
[24:46] pray Heavenly Father as we look into
[24:49] your word tonight Lord is only doing
[24:53] anything for us if you come on the scene
[24:55] and quicken it to our hearts
[24:57] I just prayed that tonight something
[24:59] would happen that would strengthen our
[25:01] faith and draw us closer to you
[25:03] and more into the ways you have us to
[25:05] walk in and ask these things a name of
[25:08] Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[25:13] just before we get into a subject I
[25:18] would like to bring to your attention
[25:21] verse 19
[25:26] but had certain questions against him of
[25:28] their own superstition or religion and
[25:31] of one Jesus which was dead who Paul
[25:37] affirmed to be alive but you see that's
[25:41] what determines a lot of things is he
[25:45] dead or is he alive
[25:46] that makes the whole difference to some
[25:48] people he stayed until some people is
[25:50] alive and you know there are a lot of
[25:53] people to then he's dead even they
[25:55] believe he he rose from the dead we
[25:57] believe it but he is still dead for them
[25:59] because he never made him alive it
[26:03] happens a lot of people in that
[26:05] situation I have heard many testimonies
[26:08] of people faithfully serving God
[26:11] faithfully doing what he called go to
[26:14] church every week and and never met him
[26:17] alive
[26:19] but he had Paul affirmed him to be alive
[26:23] and to the others he was dead he died he
[26:27] was crucified it was dead but to Paul he
[26:29] was alive
[26:30] have you questioned yourself why was he
[26:33] alive to put because he met him on the
[26:35] way to Damascus that's where he met him
[26:38] he had an understanding of the Living
[26:40] God the god of Moses the God of Jacob
[26:44] the god of Isaac and he believed in the
[26:47] God he believed in the resurrection but
[26:49] he never met God you never met God he
[26:52] knew all about him but he never met him
[26:54] until that day when he revealed himself
[26:57] to him manifested said and he said Lord
[27:00] who I heard he said I'm Jesus from their
[27:02] persecutors say that was a change in his
[27:06] life to him then God was alive this
[27:11] Jesus which was dead who pull affirmed
[27:15] to be alive and which all should have
[27:18] their testimony to affirm him to be
[27:20] alive and if we haven't seen it was that
[27:22] Lord way ie I wanna experience you alive
[27:26] it's for all of us and you know that
[27:30] determines in your life a lot of things
[27:32] you do a lot of decisions you make a lot
[27:35] of worries you have oh you don't have it
[27:38] makes such a difference
[27:40] whether you you declare him alive and I
[27:43] would just spawn encourage you see Jesus
[27:47] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[27:48] forever what he's done in your life 10
[27:51] years ago it's just like he's done it
[27:54] today it's no difference and I sometimes
[27:58] say to people look it's like a landmark
[28:02] just mark that day when the Lord came
[28:05] down and ministered to you mark the day
[28:07] when he answered your prayer mark the
[28:09] day when he healed me mark today when he
[28:11] saved you and declare it confess it you
[28:19] know brother Roman said if you save act
[28:22] like you say confess that you saved if
[28:25] you're healed act like your heel confess
[28:27] that you're healed we cannot rise above
[28:29] what our confession is so if we said
[28:33] Jesus is alive it's a people where is he
[28:36] never met him he's dead or they buried
[28:39] him somewhere or maybe he wasn't really
[28:42] dead and immigrated to India or
[28:44] somewhere and died died later you know
[28:47] here all these fantasy stories but when
[28:50] you have met him nobody can argue with
[28:53] you because he declare him alive and
[28:56] tonight I want to declare him alive but
[29:00] because he declare him to be alive you
[29:03] want to be led by him because he's got
[29:06] the words of eternal life here's the
[29:09] spirit that leads you to into the
[29:12] rapture into glory so we need to hold on
[29:16] to the Living God now it does not always
[29:20] come easy we are influenced we are
[29:24] living in a very very interesting day in
[29:27] the last day and sometimes few say oh
[29:31] well Paul already said we live in the
[29:33] last day they always said we live in the
[29:36] last day it is the last day it is the
[29:40] last day and you know when he died it's
[29:43] definitely the last day he should die
[29:45] before he comes you know it's important
[29:49] that we not get influenced by other
[29:52] leadership but
[29:53] holy spirit leadership and we want to be
[29:58] established in him now I'd like to read
[30:02] you a scripture here in first
[30:05] Corinthians I read from 1st Corinthians
[30:11] 2 from this one and I brethren when I
[30:16] came to you came not with excellency of
[30:19] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[30:23] the testimony of God for I determined
[30:26] not to know anything among you save
[30:29] Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was
[30:34] with you in weakness and in fear and in
[30:37] much trembling and my speech and my
[30:40] preaching was not with enticing words of
[30:42] man's wisdom but in demonstration of the
[30:46] Spirit and of power for what purpose
[30:50] that your faith your faith should not
[30:54] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[30:57] power of God so he wanted to establish
[31:01] the people in the power of God and I
[31:06] believe that's important to be
[31:08] established in their power and it says
[31:12] yo establish is - it says here to make
[31:15] it a permanent part or to be securely in
[31:18] place or or cause to have a firm and
[31:22] lasting position to bring into context
[31:24] to sit on firm basis to gain full
[31:28] recognition and acceptance to be
[31:30] established in the Lord in the risen
[31:34] Christ the one Paul declared to be alive
[31:37] the one I declared tonight to be alive I
[31:40] mean I couldn't not deny it up be a fool
[31:43] I've seen him not physically I - I but
[31:49] I've seen him come down in his presence
[31:52] in power and manifesting himself and
[31:56] doing things you know when he talked to
[31:59] people about the Lord I had that
[32:02] experience it's it's a few years ago now
[32:04] I was
[32:07] I had a stand as a home show I used to
[32:10] sell a few things and then mmm there
[32:13] wasn't a lunchroom I sit down and then a
[32:15] woman from another stain came and said
[32:18] that do you mind if I sit here there
[32:19] wasn't much room as it I feel free and
[32:23] you can't help but sometimes you just
[32:25] have to talk about the Lord and I was
[32:29] talking to her about the Lord and the
[32:32] Lord came on the scene and she started
[32:36] to sort of tremble she started to
[32:38] confess sins I didn't never ask for
[32:41] anything and then she said doesn't it
[32:44] say somewhere in the Bible when to talk
[32:47] about him he's right there he said he's
[32:49] right here she said he's right here and
[32:51] she was trembling praise God I know
[32:56] where when he comes and it sorts things
[32:59] it takes care of things so we want to be
[33:03] established in that power in him in that
[33:07] you see many people establish their
[33:15] ideas in people's hearts you know you go
[33:18] to any denomination of people to
[33:20] establish their teaching in people he is
[33:23] a good he's good Catholic you know or is
[33:26] a good chap a witness or he's a good
[33:28] moment or he's a good message believer
[33:30] so to speak they're established I mean
[33:34] it's good to be establishing the word
[33:36] but Paul wanted people to be
[33:38] establishing power and we all have to be
[33:41] established in power it should not
[33:43] depend on somebody come to preach to you
[33:45] or you past or anybody else but it's you
[33:48] if the Holy Ghost in you then greater is
[33:52] He that's in you than he that's in a
[33:54] world then it's you and as long the
[33:58] enemy can keep you down and say wow
[34:00] you're not good enough for whatever it's
[34:02] not you it's him and we want to be
[34:07] established in that as ever hold on that
[34:09] you see as I say said churches are
[34:13] trying to establish their doctrine
[34:19] but we have her commander to establish
[34:22] the Word of God power
[34:24] what are we preaching about ourselves or
[34:27] the kingdom of God what are we trying to
[34:29] do we're trying to establish our church
[34:31] or are we trying to establish the Word
[34:33] of God I like to read you a quote here
[34:38] from brother brain Mises the thing of it
[34:45] is today we don't try to establish the
[34:49] Word of God in people's hearts we are
[34:51] trying to establish ourselves churches
[34:56] are trying to establish the doctrine of
[34:58] the church in a person's health we are
[35:02] commanded to establish the Word of God
[35:04] Paul said I didn't come to you with
[35:08] enticing words of men that your faith
[35:13] might rest up in the knowledge of men
[35:16] but I come to you in power in
[35:19] manifestations of the Holy Ghost that
[35:22] your faith might rest in God man wasn't
[35:25] established himself see but it does
[35:29] happen and it can be even ourselves
[35:32] taking preeminence over the Holy Ghost
[35:36] well the more intellect you're have the
[35:39] more dangerous it is true truth let us
[35:44] be simple and hold on to the risen
[35:48] Christ the Living God now I just like to
[35:52] read you a few scriptures here in 1st
[35:55] Samuel so you can recognize that spirit
[36:00] that takes you away from what we meant
[36:03] to have first samuel 8 is for in all the
[36:10] elders of israel gathered themselves
[36:12] together and came to samuel and to rama
[36:15] and said unto him behold thou art old
[36:19] and thy sons walk not in the ways in thy
[36:23] ways now make us a king to judge us like
[36:26] all the nations just think about it here
[36:30] they had a prophet
[36:32] with the Word of God a type of the Holy
[36:35] Ghost
[36:36] leaving them they never missed anything
[36:40] or they had everything they had the
[36:41] leadership of Almighty God through their
[36:44] prophet and here I want a king like all
[36:47] the other nations I remember when my
[36:50] wife was telling me when she was at
[36:52] school she found it very hard
[36:56] Oh what do you do what what church oh
[36:59] wait was something oh we brethren or we
[37:01] Catholics so we're Methodists and she
[37:04] didn't know what to say and she felt it
[37:06] would be so nice to have sort of a
[37:09] belonging and you know a lot of people
[37:11] liked it to belong to something and then
[37:14] we try to say I want to belong to this
[37:17] now if you belong to Christ he sometimes
[37:20] whooping your honor not alone he's with
[37:23] you but you may be rejected you may be
[37:26] persecuted you may be despised you don't
[37:32] have to put a tag on just to be part of
[37:35] something you need to be part of them so
[37:38] they sit make us a king like all the
[37:41] other nations what it'd be like them
[37:43] because it looks good you know they have
[37:47] a big army and they have a king sitting
[37:51] there and it all looks so wonderful but
[37:54] that's not the way the Lord leads people
[37:56] and then but the thing displeased Samuel
[38:01] now he was grieved in his spirit that's
[38:05] not right why did the grievin when they
[38:08] said give us a king to judge us and
[38:10] Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord
[38:13] said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice
[38:15] of the people in all that they say unto
[38:19] thee for they have not rejected thee but
[38:23] they have rejected me see that's what it
[38:26] is
[38:27] they have rejected the Lord
[38:30] they haven't rejected Samuel they
[38:32] haven't rejected your advice they
[38:34] haven't reject they have rejected the
[38:35] Lord because they don't want that they
[38:38] want to be like the others that I should
[38:42] not reign over them he said that's they
[38:44] didn't want God to reign Oh
[38:46] them see that's it's so obvious
[38:50] sometimes people feel comfortable in
[38:53] their little religious service and
[38:57] toonies and and walk and they don't want
[39:00] the Holy Ghost to tell them oh I want to
[39:03] do this next week are going to do that
[39:05] and they're gonna do that no I don't
[39:07] know what the Holy Ghost to say
[39:09] something different you know it's human
[39:11] nature you can't get a plane and you
[39:14] want to do what do you want to do you
[39:17] don't need anything else
[39:18] don't worry I don't even want to go to
[39:20] church otherwise somebody might say
[39:21] something different no we don't want to
[39:25] reject the Holy Ghost leadership you
[39:28] never know what he leads you to I'll
[39:31] give you an example or what never was
[39:33] the big younger I was quite poor I mean
[39:36] rich in the Lord you know but
[39:38] financially I wasn't thriving and I had
[39:43] seven children and we needed to have a
[39:47] bigger house we we couldn't afford so I
[39:50] bought a piece of land well people
[39:54] didn't want it because there was a city
[39:57] dump next door who wants to live next to
[40:00] a dump you have to have a leading to buy
[40:06] a section next to a dump I can assure
[40:08] you it was the cheapest one acre section
[40:11] in the whole town but there was a row of
[40:13] trees and the wind was usually blowing
[40:17] from the other side so it didn't bother
[40:19] us but you know the moment we moved in
[40:23] Council he started close to dump and now
[40:25] it's a park how would you know that you
[40:30] don't but the Lord knows so when you
[40:33] laid by him you have a great advantage
[40:36] but if you labor you ain't le now I
[40:39] would want that no I don't want to live
[40:42] next to a dump but it turned out to be a
[40:45] real blessing because the Lord knows
[40:47] what's around the corner we don't that's
[40:50] why we need the leadership of him not
[40:52] walk by sight but by faith so
[40:58] says here in in verse nine I read from
[41:03] verse eight according to all the works
[41:05] which they have done since the day I
[41:07] brought them out of Egypt even unto this
[41:09] day
[41:09] we're with they have shaken me and
[41:12] served other gods so do they also unto
[41:17] thee now therefore hearken unto their
[41:19] voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto
[41:23] them and show them the manner of the
[41:26] king that shall reign over them he said
[41:29] let him have what they want but tell him
[41:32] what will happen see if they say wanted
[41:35] and Samuel told all the words of the
[41:38] Lord unto the people did ask him of a
[41:42] king and he said this will be the manner
[41:45] of the king that shall reign over you
[41:49] this will be the manner of the king he
[41:52] will take your sons and appoint them for
[41:55] himself for his chariots and to be his
[41:58] horsemen and Sam shall run before his
[42:01] chariots how wonderful the severe sons
[42:06] were their sons when they were on the
[42:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost once you
[42:10] have a king he'll take you sons the best
[42:12] ones the strongest they have to serve
[42:16] him well son can you help me to fix the
[42:21] roof on a house sorry
[42:22] I've gone upon the king so they lose
[42:26] their sons verse 12 and he will appoint
[42:30] him captains over thousands and
[42:33] captain's over fifties and who sit them
[42:36] to ear his ground and to reap his
[42:38] harvest and to make his instruments of
[42:41] war and instruments of his chariots work
[42:44] for him no longer for the family no
[42:49] longer for the benefit of the household
[42:51] work for a king and he will take your
[42:56] daughters to be confectionaries and to
[42:59] be cooks and to be bakers and and will
[43:03] take your fields and your vineyards and
[43:05] your olive the arts even the best of
[43:07] them and give them to his servants well
[43:11] they never had to pay taxes before
[43:14] certainly it all comes in and he will
[43:18] take the tenth of your seed and of your
[43:21] vineyards and give to his officers and
[43:24] to his servants and he will take your
[43:28] maidservants and your maidservants and
[43:31] your godliest young man and your SS and
[43:34] put them to his work and he will take
[43:38] the tenth of your sheep and you shall be
[43:40] his servants
[43:41] well that is slavery that's terrible
[43:45] what do you want that but they wanted it
[43:49] they wanted it and you shall cry out in
[43:53] the in that day because of your King
[43:55] which he shall have chosen you and the
[43:59] Lord will not hear you in that day I
[44:02] find that's a dramatic thing here they
[44:06] are told the consequences and they still
[44:10] didn't want to leadership of the Holy
[44:12] Ghost always still concerns the Lord and
[44:15] you know people always soothe something
[44:18] but it's not the Living God because the
[44:21] Living God wants to lead his sheep by
[44:23] his spirited sons of God are led by the
[44:27] Spirit of God otherwise it's a man that
[44:32] leads them it says nevertheless that
[44:35] people refuse to obey the voice of
[44:37] Samuel and they said night but we will
[44:41] have a king over us that we also may be
[44:43] like all the nations and that our king
[44:47] my judges and go out before us and fight
[44:50] our battles must be so great you know
[44:55] having a king with all the army coming
[44:58] you know when you see these army
[45:02] presentations like the HS had one in
[45:05] Korea you know that tanks count the rock
[45:07] that's come and thousands of soldiers
[45:10] walk down the street the people clapping
[45:12] it looks great and then the planes fly
[45:15] over and you know a demonstration of
[45:18] power and have people wanted that and
[45:23] therefore God
[45:25] the one that's all powerful they can
[45:28] raise the hand and the Red Sea opens up
[45:30] they can rain fire from heaven can open
[45:34] the ground and swallow up whole armies
[45:36] they forgot about that power they want
[45:39] to see it you know tangibly see it and
[45:42] that's human nature we want to see it
[45:44] and honestly I wanted god I can see to
[45:50] be alive in my life I always said to be
[45:54] but I'm not I don't have fantasies I'm a
[45:59] realist I'm realistic if the Bible says
[46:02] it then it's got to be somewhere if he's
[46:04] alive then he's got to be somewhere and
[46:07] he has to be found and we can find him
[46:09] and we so quickly discouraged by things
[46:13] and we so quickly can like the other
[46:16] nations or say it this way like the
[46:20] other churches just talk about what he's
[46:23] done in the past and forget about him to
[46:25] be alive today happens happens I know
[46:29] people I can go to their house all they
[46:33] tell me all these testimonies of brother
[46:35] Branham what happened 60 years ago but
[46:39] brother Branham was preaching he's the
[46:41] same yesterday today and forever his
[46:44] spirit in you does the same works same
[46:46] power same miracles same manifestations
[46:49] and he proven it to be true all we need
[46:54] to do is to say Lord your spirit come in
[46:58] me fill me and let my mind put aside all
[47:02] the things I've been thinking and
[47:04] wondering I want to be laid by you it's
[47:07] wonderful and then you experience the
[47:10] same power the same thing or sharing it
[47:13] pissed at me somebody who probably hate
[47:16] the spoken word well what is it
[47:20] surprised it was the Lord speaking
[47:23] through you it's nothing to do with you
[47:26] but you have to let him have his way and
[47:30] I can say you know you're out in the
[47:33] world and you're entertained you go I
[47:35] have a coffee somewhere you're not
[47:37] always
[47:38] that's sensitive but there's times when
[47:41] when you are where is to Lord and then
[47:43] when you speak and if it's the Lord
[47:45] everybody knows this alone it's not huge
[47:47] I love that same power same
[47:51] manifestation today in you if you have
[47:55] the Holy Ghost the Jesus Paul affirmed
[47:58] to be alive living in you by His Holy
[48:01] Spirit their power is within you and the
[48:06] devil's job is to keep it suppressed so
[48:09] it doesn't come out keep even your faith
[48:11] down a level where you have to trust
[48:14] other people to pray in their prayers
[48:19] isn't yours good enough there are some
[48:23] times when you have prayer meetings I've
[48:25] noticed sometimes people tell the Lord
[48:28] what he should do and how he should do
[48:31] it but he's well capable he knows
[48:35] exactly how they get through to a person
[48:38] he knows exactly how to speak to you he
[48:41] knows exactly how much you can handle
[48:44] before you fold he knows exactly so we
[48:47] don't have to tell him how to do it he
[48:49] knows how to do things just be aware of
[48:51] the Living God and don't take on other
[48:55] lead the ship like these realize this we
[48:59] want a king because you can get so used
[49:02] to being in in the religious slavery if
[49:07] you're religious you're not free and you
[49:11] can get so used to it
[49:13] oh I go to church if three times a week
[49:17] I'll do this I pray as my my Bible study
[49:21] in the morning and you know some people
[49:23] have quite a sick program I think it's
[49:27] so used to but it's becomes like a
[49:30] slavery
[49:32] they're actually enslaved I said once to
[49:36] a person and come to the Lord I said
[49:38] look it's like this they have this
[49:41] little rabbit in the backyard and the
[49:43] little round cage around it and they
[49:46] said look it's like this here you're in
[49:49] the cage then the Lord Jesus comes to
[49:52] see free lifts off their cage but if you
[49:55] don't walk in there Liberty a church
[49:59] comes and puts a cage on you
[50:01] another group comes maybe puts a bigger
[50:03] cage on you some are very narrow cage
[50:05] you're allowed to do anything in this
[50:07] church or in this church if more liberty
[50:09] but still a cage ought to be lead by the
[50:13] Holy Ghost that is the ultimate and you
[50:16] know these cages if you're in a cage for
[50:20] years and you don't know very very
[50:22] sincere people they've been all their
[50:24] lives in a church where they have quite
[50:28] a tight cage I was there once I was in
[50:31] their cage but I sometimes broke out and
[50:35] so I was considered a rebel but you know
[50:39] they had strict rules if we want to sing
[50:44] in a choir you know that have a beard
[50:47] Wow
[50:48] where does that say in a Bible you know
[50:50] for instance and they said you sisters
[50:54] the way you have to do you here is such
[50:57] in such a way till you 16 you'll have to
[51:01] have plaits
[51:02] and after that you have to have a bun no
[51:04] other here hidden would be tolerated I
[51:07] went to church are there sincere people
[51:10] lovely people and they grow up for years
[51:14] and years and years in there and if one
[51:16] day her sister will forget to do her
[51:18] here she thinks she's going to hell
[51:20] because you know it's silly it's silly
[51:23] it's a cage it's not the Liberty Christ
[51:27] called us to be in but it happens you
[51:31] know you heard that expression Stockholm
[51:35] Syndrome have you ever heard of that you
[51:38] know when it when a person say a bad
[51:43] person kidnaps a girl and keeps her
[51:47] locked up and after months a month and
[51:50] year she starts to get used to being
[51:54] mistreated and everything and likes to
[51:58] be in that situation almost it's not
[52:01] normal
[52:02] still in slave
[52:05] captured still kidnapped and sometimes
[52:09] people get religious Stockholm Syndrome
[52:13] they think oh yeah that's it I love it
[52:17] I'll have to go to church you know and
[52:18] they force itself I love to go to church
[52:22] I hope you all do but it's not because
[52:25] you have to but it can end up that way
[52:28] only happens when you refuse the
[52:32] leadership of the Holy Spirit in your
[52:34] life
[52:36] and you know to refuse the Holy Spirit
[52:40] is when you have too much of a plan and
[52:44] I know people then they say I have to do
[52:48] this when I was a that's years ago I was
[52:53] running a training course and they had
[52:56] different people there
[52:57] I wasn't Saudi Arabia at the time and
[53:00] then I think six times a day all the
[53:04] shutters go down and the carpets come
[53:06] out and do bow down towards Mecca or
[53:08] somewhere and say their prayers the
[53:11] Muslims I don't I had a man on the
[53:14] course and he he was a Catholic he said
[53:16] what a stupid the religion is Muslims
[53:18] you know he's a head stupid six times a
[53:22] day
[53:23] he said I'm Catholic morning prayer
[53:26] evening prayer finished done you tell
[53:31] him to die to self and accept the
[53:34] leadership the Holy Ghost he wouldn't
[53:35] want that he's happy with that religion
[53:38] twice a day you have to say your prayers
[53:41] and you Danny you know in Jesus was born
[53:44] the Bible says he wrote and all
[53:47] Jerusalem was troubled we are one
[53:50] another King we're happy with he what he
[53:53] said and we're happy to pay our little
[53:55] Texas and have our liberties and get
[53:57] away with this and there we don't want
[53:58] anything else we don't want to hold it
[54:01] oh schooling and reigning over us and
[54:03] you know if we don't want the Holy Ghost
[54:05] we don't see the power that's what it is
[54:08] only comes in interesting ways a tell
[54:11] you what he comes when we at least
[54:14] expect him sometime you know I always
[54:18] say when you
[54:19] feel least to pray when you down I don't
[54:22] feel like praying I feel miserable
[54:25] that's the most powerful prayers when
[54:28] you do that when you go on your knees
[54:30] despite Satan get behind me I believe
[54:33] her trust don't feel it but I know it's
[54:35] the truth we'll need to do that never
[54:39] reject the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[54:41] in your life he will lead you in all
[54:44] truth the Bible says now taking on other
[54:50] leadership
[54:53] besides the Holy Ghost is rejecting God
[54:57] that's what it is it's actually
[54:59] rejecting God and if you reject God
[55:04] you're not just rejected I don't want I
[55:07] still believe in God no you reject God
[55:10] you reject his work of salvation no no I
[55:13] believe he died for my sins so don't go
[55:15] hell no reject His grace you reject his
[55:18] power you reject all of them we cannot
[55:21] have him in part Oh heaven life as my
[55:25] savior but not as my Lord doesn't work
[55:28] that way have you ever met a person who
[55:30] marries a husband oh I want him you know
[55:35] for this but no before that
[55:37] no he's your husband he's everything he
[55:40] is you know I married my wife she's uh
[55:43] I'll marry her because she's good cooks
[55:45] it's not if you if you ever go cook
[55:48] yours they have a loving wife you have
[55:51] this you have one that bears your
[55:53] children you have a book mother you have
[55:55] everything it's not heaven Savior and
[55:59] others Lord doesn't work doesn't work
[56:01] that is religion that is religion and
[56:05] there's not the power of the Holy Ghost
[56:07] that's why it's missing so often say we
[56:11] can't be full of oneself and full of the
[56:14] Holy Ghost the same time you know that
[56:17] song we sing sometimes Jesus all for
[56:20] Jesus all of our planes and missions and
[56:23] things I surrender them
[56:26] I surrender them because were every one
[56:30] his plane
[56:31] and hard love there I wish that but
[56:35] surrender it all to him surrender it all
[56:38] to him
[56:39] then the Holy Ghost can lead you if you
[56:42] have plans those plans will lead you or
[56:45] may make you do things and make
[56:49] decisions accordingly and you can miss
[56:52] the Holy Ghost altogether it's wonderful
[56:57] when you are walking being led by the
[56:59] Holy Ghost then it doesn't matter if
[57:02] things work out the way you thought or
[57:04] they don't you know he's right with me
[57:08] we declare him alive we declare him
[57:12] alive so my convictions are my desires
[57:15] must be of the Holy Ghost if I'm
[57:18] persuading others and if it's not the
[57:24] Holy Ghost then it's wrong you know I
[57:26] can persuade people to do certain things
[57:28] that don't do certain things but it's
[57:30] got to be the Holy Ghost I've heard
[57:32] brother say shouldn't be going and drag
[57:36] him out and tell him that's wrong to do
[57:38] with this I said look the Lord brought
[57:41] him thus far the Lord will lead him on
[57:45] if you have a strong leaning sure you do
[57:48] it but often we more a hindrance if we
[57:52] do things if it's not inspired by the
[57:54] Holy Ghost so the Holy Spirit will bring
[57:58] conviction with remedy have you noticed
[58:01] is that he doesn't just say your ass in
[58:03] knees that look here I paid the price
[58:05] you know the Spirit of God has nothing
[58:09] in common with the spirit of
[58:11] denomination but that is so strong in
[58:16] our day you know it's not necessarily
[58:19] just a church it can be yourself at the
[58:22] nomination there's only room for Jesus
[58:26] and His Word and I like I like to read
[58:29] it another quote even brother Branham
[58:31] uses just as the early church started
[58:34] out under the pure Ministry of the Holy
[58:37] Spirit with signs and wonders and
[58:40] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[58:44] and the interpretation wisdom knowledge
[58:47] and healing so in the last days of
[58:50] Israel when they left Egypt they were
[58:54] under the leadership of the Spirit of
[58:57] God manifesting in gifts God was the
[59:01] leader of the people actually he was
[59:04] their king he was father King he took
[59:09] care of Israel like a man cares for his
[59:11] family he fed them fought their battles
[59:15] smoothed away their difficulties and
[59:18] settled their problems
[59:19] he just busied himself over them they
[59:23] were the only nation to which he was
[59:26] truly God but one day they got to
[59:30] looking around and so the Philistines
[59:32] and other nations with kings over them
[59:35] it caught their eyes and they decided
[59:38] that they ought to humanize their
[59:41] leadership so they wanted the king now
[59:44] God was going to humanize the leadership
[59:46] himself in the person of Jesus Christ
[59:48] but they got ahead of him Satan knew the
[59:52] plan of God so he put it in the hearts
[59:55] of the people to get ahead of God isn't
[59:59] that interesting you know you can't not
[1:00:02] go ahead or hold back you have to go
[1:00:05] with win the Lord leads you know we
[1:00:09] we're in a day we want everything
[1:00:12] straight away straight away we wanted
[1:00:14] today and young people even more it's
[1:00:18] here nice car look I want that who how
[1:00:23] many horsepower who well sounds like you
[1:00:25] ly hate Oh must have that how much is it
[1:00:28] Oh $4,000 oh I've got only 1500 what can
[1:00:32] you borrow me you know can you lend me
[1:00:34] some money needs to be the Deus and now
[1:00:36] shouldn't be like that but that's the
[1:00:39] way we wanted but the Lord in his time
[1:00:43] he brings to pass his will he's word in
[1:00:46] US and through us so let's be patient
[1:00:50] see
[1:00:54] there's no other leadership we want in
[1:00:56] our lives but the Holy Spirit there are
[1:01:00] people they try to take leadership of
[1:01:02] your life and sometimes it's close to
[1:01:04] home I know I don't point fingers but I
[1:01:09] know families we the wife calls the
[1:01:13] shots
[1:01:14] absolutely and if he doesn't do that
[1:01:19] then the bare atmosphere in your home is
[1:01:22] that the Holy Ghost
[1:01:24] or is it either wife then you get
[1:01:29] husband's on the head of the house I
[1:01:32] would says you know you have to submit
[1:01:34] but they're not fully sold out to Christ
[1:01:39] then it's not the Holy Ghost leadership
[1:01:42] either say sometimes close to home these
[1:01:45] things we need to be to know what we are
[1:01:49] following you know Bible says or the
[1:01:52] Lord said my sheep hear my voice and I
[1:01:54] know them and they follow me and I give
[1:01:56] unto them eternal life and they shall
[1:01:58] never perish neither shall any man pluck
[1:02:00] them out of my hand
[1:02:02] yes sheep will know his voice it doesn't
[1:02:05] sound right
[1:02:06] don't be late by it just be aware his
[1:02:10] voice is you know it once you've heard
[1:02:13] it you hear it again you know Bible says
[1:02:18] sons have gone a little Spirit of God
[1:02:21] but you know when was Israel led by the
[1:02:25] Spirit of God through Moses when they
[1:02:28] were still in slavery but they're still
[1:02:30] in the world and I believe every one of
[1:02:33] us it was the Spirit of God and drew us
[1:02:36] after world isn't there wonderful why
[1:02:39] was oh no you can't you wouldn't have
[1:02:42] hid the Holy Ghost but he was the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost and led you because you hear his
[1:02:47] voice because you're his sheep I love
[1:02:50] that you know it's so true and sometimes
[1:02:53] you know I knew when I was in the world
[1:02:56] are they things and and somebody was
[1:02:59] trying to tell me oh you were in the
[1:03:01] world it's probably what's the devil
[1:03:03] kind of being God you know experience
[1:03:06] miracle in the world
[1:03:08] I kind of been gone what spirit would
[1:03:11] want to lead me out of the world into
[1:03:13] Christ the Holy Ghost not the devil and
[1:03:15] he knew us before we were even born my
[1:03:20] sheep hear my voice and I always say I'm
[1:03:23] still listening to the same voice they
[1:03:25] brought me out of Egypt not another one
[1:03:27] and the one that brought me out of Egypt
[1:03:29] is the one that led me to the promised
[1:03:32] land and he's still the same one in the
[1:03:34] promised land who leads me you know
[1:03:36] Moses was the voice and then it was
[1:03:40] Joshua the same voice just another
[1:03:44] person but the same voice and we need to
[1:03:48] follow the same voice all along well he
[1:03:53] leads us into all truth if he if it just
[1:03:56] a couple of things here he's an unknown
[1:03:59] author about being lead by other things
[1:04:05] besides the Holy Ghost one of the
[1:04:09] characteristics of of six is that they
[1:04:13] judge all other believers to be lost but
[1:04:16] they claim in effect is unless you agree
[1:04:19] with me on all issues that I define as
[1:04:21] essential
[1:04:22] you cannot be saved of who that because
[1:04:26] I don't see it as their way you can't be
[1:04:30] deprived you know you know have you ever
[1:04:33] thought about it even the natural my
[1:04:37] tells you who is the bride it's the one
[1:04:41] the bridegroom comes to and says will
[1:04:43] you marry me she's the bride and I think
[1:04:47] you all know that story brother Brent
[1:04:49] tells about this farm girl she was
[1:04:52] orphaned and they're a big party this
[1:04:55] big rich man coming along and all the
[1:04:58] girls dressed up but she was in the
[1:05:00] kitchen beer feet you know doing dishes
[1:05:02] she wasn't even allowed enough then the
[1:05:06] rich man got a bit warm and put out to
[1:05:08] get some fresh air and saw this girl and
[1:05:10] he fell in love with her and he said
[1:05:13] will you marry me
[1:05:14] she said yes he said I'll come in
[1:05:17] springtime look everybody now you're not
[1:05:20] the bride if anybody
[1:05:22] it's her you know she's has more dignity
[1:05:25] and she's got this the other but she
[1:05:27] knew she was so who cause he bribed the
[1:05:31] bridegroom praise the Lord
[1:05:34] so no matter what people's opinions are
[1:05:39] offer you if he tells you I love you you
[1:05:43] can be sure he loves you
[1:05:44] Amen you see there is a spirit of
[1:05:48] denomination which sometimes is very
[1:05:51] hard to be soon I mean lots of spirit we
[1:05:55] battled with and I've got a son he just
[1:05:58] come out of off the world and he's his
[1:06:03] dad look there's so many things are here
[1:06:06] and see but I know they are of the devil
[1:06:08] aren't they oh no good I said yeah there
[1:06:10] many voices the many voices but you know
[1:06:12] when the Lord speaks and you know it
[1:06:15] when it's not the Lord yes I do so
[1:06:17] praise God you can't avoid to be exposed
[1:06:20] to all the different voices you might be
[1:06:22] thoughts in your mind where did that
[1:06:24] come from I don't want that you know
[1:06:26] obviously not familiar if you don't want
[1:06:28] it it's know from here so we have these
[1:06:31] different spirits we have spirits of
[1:06:34] denomination which is very strong like I
[1:06:36] said you can be a one-man denomination
[1:06:38] and the easiest way to become a
[1:06:41] denomination is when you reach it
[1:06:42] refused to leave ship of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:45] we have national spirits we know their
[1:06:54] national spirits sometimes they strong
[1:06:58] and sometimes they don't and sometimes
[1:07:02] they come up we've got family spirits
[1:07:06] did you know there but we don't have to
[1:07:09] be bound and leave by them I put my past
[1:07:15] under the blood so I am NOT a family
[1:07:19] spirit elite by a family spirit you know
[1:07:23] I know a family spirits to the Lord ones
[1:07:26] showed us a family spirit and we did not
[1:07:29] know we didn't want to be judgmental but
[1:07:32] that's what the Lord showed us I think
[1:07:34] of course it was obvious
[1:07:36] start to find that yeah that's a truth
[1:07:38] there are family spirits there's also
[1:07:43] the Holy Spirit hey man that's the one
[1:07:47] that's the one we want to believe by
[1:07:53] says the spirit of denomination can also
[1:07:56] just affect one person within the church
[1:07:59] also a person who is in the church
[1:08:01] denomination is not automatically led by
[1:08:04] the spirit of denomination can you get
[1:08:08] that how many people come out of a
[1:08:11] church into more light into more truth
[1:08:15] you know like I said I was in a church
[1:08:17] with such a small cage and not just two
[1:08:23] three months three and a half years and
[1:08:26] I was faithful I went to every meeting I
[1:08:29] could go and and it was faithful I
[1:08:32] endured sometimes preaching you know I
[1:08:38] thought well you you really have to have
[1:08:40] faith to sit in there for an hour you
[1:08:42] know it's it's been right there but I
[1:08:46] was lit by the Holy Ghost they preached
[1:08:50] against water baptism who do you believe
[1:08:53] that how can you believe preach against
[1:08:56] water baptism because the founder came
[1:09:01] out from churchianity and at the time
[1:09:05] the Catholic said unless you baptize you
[1:09:08] go to hell you have to be baptized
[1:09:10] otherwise you're not can't be saved so
[1:09:14] so that so that people wouldn't have
[1:09:17] confidence just in the water he they
[1:09:20] actually left it alone they didn't
[1:09:22] preach baptism but it's wrong baba says
[1:09:25] repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus
[1:09:27] Christ and he shall receive the roomies
[1:09:29] the gift of the Holy Ghost you know I
[1:09:33] was in the church
[1:09:33] I want to be baptized because the Bible
[1:09:35] says wanted to be baptized I had to
[1:09:38] apply for it and wait six months and
[1:09:41] then there wasn't some swimming pool
[1:09:43] thing and there was for me it was an
[1:09:45] emotional experience but then later on I
[1:09:49] heard that
[1:09:50] about baptism in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ guess what happened
[1:09:54] I was rebaptised 1st of May 1983
[1:09:58] rebaptised name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:00] coming out the water speaking in tongues
[1:10:02] and so angels are all around I said at
[1:10:04] the ceiling on the edge there no lights
[1:10:08] there but they realized they praise God
[1:10:11] I was in a denomination but I was not
[1:10:15] led by that spirit
[1:10:16] it's a sooner or later the Lord takes
[1:10:19] you out of it into him so never judge
[1:10:23] people by where they are or you know if
[1:10:28] you got our message to you not all
[1:10:30] automatically lit by the Holy Ghost it's
[1:10:33] not youth it's an individual of fear so
[1:10:35] the Holy Spirit leadership can be
[1:10:38] accepted and followed anywhere in church
[1:10:42] at work at home on holidays basic and
[1:10:44] every part of our lives any given point
[1:10:47] I worked as a man comes 5 o'clock is
[1:10:52] here now we can soothe God again you
[1:10:54] know well maybe I wasn't the best worker
[1:10:58] I can help but just talk about the Lord
[1:11:00] the whole day know I don't know think
[1:11:02] most useless in some areas but you see
[1:11:04] you can not to say now I can't soothe
[1:11:06] God now I can soothe God you can
[1:11:09] restrict them if you restrict him you
[1:11:11] restrict the power and you restrict the
[1:11:14] glory that's for you and meant for you
[1:11:17] now give you an a just a couple of
[1:11:20] practical thoughts the spear of
[1:11:25] denomination restricts the Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] movement and leadership often due to the
[1:11:31] fact of self-inflicted boundaries and
[1:11:34] restrictions too I've known people
[1:11:39] decide a contract are gonna work three
[1:11:43] years in Saudi Arabia I've been to Saudi
[1:11:46] Arabia but only three weeks to run the
[1:11:48] course but this man he signed a contract
[1:11:52] three years he said well three years of
[1:11:55] my wife the money is good but you know
[1:11:57] it was hot it they were in a closing
[1:12:01] compound
[1:12:03] they had the food and everything for
[1:12:05] free they were that weren't able to do
[1:12:09] anything they were not allowed to preach
[1:12:12] the gospel it's prohibited so how can
[1:12:17] you so they basically say I signed I
[1:12:22] signed for three years so the Holy Ghost
[1:12:24] can only lead me in teri Arabia
[1:12:27] he's can't move me to America he can't
[1:12:29] move me to New Zealand you can't sent me
[1:12:31] anywhere else because I signed the paper
[1:12:33] tell you what time to paper if God says
[1:12:36] sign this paper I want you here for
[1:12:38] three years do it but if you're not sure
[1:12:42] don't get yourself in a situation where
[1:12:44] you restrict his movement you know the
[1:12:47] spirit that spirit can't or you can
[1:12:50] restrict you know people sometimes I
[1:12:56] know people they buy stuff on high
[1:13:00] perches all right and get them self
[1:13:04] indebted very much and then you hear in
[1:13:07] the prayer meetings oh you know lord
[1:13:10] help me to pay my debts I need but I
[1:13:12] need work and they eat money
[1:13:14] you know self-inflicted and then you
[1:13:18] restrict the Holy Ghost
[1:13:19] movement you don't have to stay there
[1:13:23] you repent and he takes you straight
[1:13:26] back to where you left it repentance I
[1:13:30] know I mean he went into a partnership
[1:13:35] with another mean looked all good you
[1:13:38] know will bite us together and make
[1:13:41] money and sell it again and whatever his
[1:13:44] confession to me was about three years
[1:13:47] later he said brother I lost all my
[1:13:53] money I had a nearly lost my life he got
[1:13:57] so upset and problems and things
[1:14:00] restricting the Holy Ghost
[1:14:03] the Lord can only bless you and him
[1:14:06] together
[1:14:07] I mean husband wife is good partnership
[1:14:10] but you know sometimes it's so easily
[1:14:13] done but the Holy Spirit might want to
[1:14:16] leave you lift
[1:14:17] and the other one he might want to leave
[1:14:20] right but then it's not a partnership
[1:14:22] partnership is you and Christ that's the
[1:14:25] partnership you know I'm just saying
[1:14:28] this not as a as a rule you know what I
[1:14:32] mean but I want to say don't restrict
[1:14:37] the leading of the Holy Ghost if you're
[1:14:39] free and sole down to Lord whatever you
[1:14:42] have here I am you can't do them if you
[1:14:47] restrict yourself and sign yourself over
[1:14:51] to whatever that's why I would say it's
[1:14:54] very very very important for a woman who
[1:14:57] gets married that she knows that's the
[1:14:59] perfect will of God
[1:15:01] because you you loose some kind of
[1:15:05] Liberty you know you can't just say look
[1:15:08] I'm taking off for a few months so what
[1:15:10] I would go for my overseas trip no
[1:15:12] you're at home you you look after things
[1:15:15] so that's why we need to be hearing from
[1:15:19] God otherwise we open ourselves for
[1:15:23] misery and then the Lord can't lead you
[1:15:26] live because you decided you want to
[1:15:29] stay right here hope you know it's I'll
[1:15:34] give you just a quote here then we just
[1:15:38] about closed up here bar embassies clean
[1:15:41] your lives up pay your debts oh no man
[1:15:45] jesus said now I mean like your house
[1:15:49] rent and stuff that's different you know
[1:15:52] you have to pay rent you got to do it
[1:15:54] get all your things off your hands get
[1:15:58] everything right make ready get ready
[1:16:02] remember in the name of the Lord
[1:16:04] something is fixing to happen it can't
[1:16:07] be ready if you tied down you can't
[1:16:10] still Lord sit look I want you all oh I
[1:16:15] don't know how to put it but I went to
[1:16:18] shop the other day I know this man there
[1:16:21] is a Muslim there where is I'm here is
[1:16:25] his name where is he oh you ain't to
[1:16:28] Saudi Arabia before you know
[1:16:31] all Muslims once in a lifetime they have
[1:16:33] to go a pilgrimage to somewhere up there
[1:16:36] and he faithfully does that I don't
[1:16:40] think he's he's going all the way to
[1:16:43] Saudi Arabia because of a religious
[1:16:46] belief but if the Holy Spirit would tell
[1:16:49] you to go to a place can you do it or
[1:16:52] send our Lord sorry I just did this so
[1:16:55] tight myself down here it's got to be
[1:16:58] according to his perfect will and we
[1:17:01] need to know it like Paul I just want to
[1:17:04] go back once more to Paul when he was in
[1:17:06] prison the Lord appeared to him and says
[1:17:08] as you were a witness for me in
[1:17:11] Jerusalem so will you be a witness in
[1:17:13] Rome and the next thing his nephew heard
[1:17:19] that they made a plot to kill him to say
[1:17:23] regard a king look we need to ask some
[1:17:25] more questions when he brings him out we
[1:17:27] kill him 40 man said we don't eat nor
[1:17:30] drink till he's dead then if you heard
[1:17:34] that and then if you went and told Paul
[1:17:38] Paul didn't just say why don't worry I'm
[1:17:41] predestinated the word says got it wrong
[1:17:44] I'll be a witnessing wrong don't worry
[1:17:47] just relax no he had to bring the word
[1:17:50] to pass make your election and calling
[1:17:53] sure the Bible says if you know the will
[1:17:55] of God walk in it so he did every put
[1:17:59] everything in place he could to hinder
[1:18:02] that he would be killed and he sent the
[1:18:05] nephew with a letter to to the king and
[1:18:07] and he explained it and then they took
[1:18:09] him by night and with a with an army and
[1:18:11] and save them but you see it's we have
[1:18:17] the word but we have to play our part
[1:18:21] with it you know we need to play our
[1:18:24] path I said the other day it's like this
[1:18:26] symphony you know when when you have
[1:18:28] music and you have one party in it you
[1:18:32] have to follow the music even if you
[1:18:34] just have one heart and you won one guy
[1:18:37] I went to school with them and it was
[1:18:42] not the brightest
[1:18:44] what name anybody but he wasn't the
[1:18:47] brightest but he played in no history
[1:18:49] I said well you have to be clever but
[1:18:53] you know what he played those two do you
[1:18:56] call him simple she smoked together and
[1:18:59] in a whole piece of music he only came
[1:19:03] in once or twice bang bang and that's
[1:19:05] what all he had to do but he had to
[1:19:07] follow the sheep music and know when it
[1:19:10] was his turn so that's what I'm saying
[1:19:13] we have to be in line with the word and
[1:19:16] play our part so we know when when he
[1:19:18] wants us to move and use us let's do it
[1:19:22] amen just in closing here I said live by
[1:19:29] faith but don't tempt God if you are in
[1:19:32] the faith under leadership for the Holy
[1:19:33] Ghost ain't know what the situation is
[1:19:36] you will have joy come up with a new new
[1:19:41] instrument a faithful meter you know
[1:19:46] measure you the level of faith we have
[1:19:48] and the increments are in joy if you're
[1:19:55] healthy you have joy that's our faith in
[1:19:59] the Lord you know truth will line up
[1:20:01] with the Bible same works same anointing
[1:20:05] same power power and if we don't see it
[1:20:09] in our lives we only have to that's
[1:20:12] Christ of yesterday if we don't see it
[1:20:14] in our lives and as I said I'm a realist
[1:20:18] I want to see it if I don't see it white
[1:20:21] until it comes seek the Lord
[1:20:25] until you find him you know one of the
[1:20:28] greatest greatest annoying things that
[1:20:32] came down my wife and I we were living
[1:20:36] in a flat once and they'd had an evil
[1:20:38] spirit in it when Christine was still
[1:20:41] young and it affected us it affected her
[1:20:47] she was nearly killed
[1:20:48] like strangled and something was funny
[1:20:51] in that house and I had we had a lot of
[1:20:55] arguments and things that was just not
[1:20:57] right
[1:20:58] and I worked at 40-hour week and and
[1:21:04] then one night I woke up as one o'clock
[1:21:06] in the morning and I hurt my wife crying
[1:21:09] in a lounge and you know you have to get
[1:21:13] up in the morning you go to work and
[1:21:15] don't want to spend to half the night
[1:21:17] fussing so I went out and said what's
[1:21:20] the matter come to beat I wasn't very
[1:21:23] understanding obviously but I said that
[1:21:25] and she said no I'm not coming to be it
[1:21:29] here it says love joy peace I don't see
[1:21:34] it I want to know why oh whoa here we
[1:21:39] are in for a long haul you know as in
[1:21:42] well look that's the attitude we should
[1:21:46] have I said Lord you said in you word
[1:21:49] this why don't that see it
[1:21:52] I confess it I believe it I want to see
[1:21:55] it you know and I said what you want me
[1:21:58] to pray for you she said yes I went on
[1:22:01] my knees and I was half asleep and I
[1:22:04] mumbled something I can't remember what
[1:22:06] I said and then just about dropped off
[1:22:08] to sleep and then she started to pray
[1:22:11] and I tell you what it wasn't her
[1:22:13] praying was the Holy Ghost praying it
[1:22:15] was words of confessing the power of God
[1:22:19] confessing the glory of God thanking him
[1:22:23] for her for everything not the way she
[1:22:26] felt it was the Holy Ghost a man I woke
[1:22:30] up in a hurry
[1:22:31] and then that spirit came down the Holy
[1:22:34] Ghost and we screamed and cried and
[1:22:36] prayed till 3:00 in the morning we went
[1:22:39] to debate we couldn't sleep it was so
[1:22:41] heavy we jumped up and down and being
[1:22:43] praising God and praising God we could
[1:22:45] sir couldn't stop and we called on the
[1:22:48] blood of the Lord and thanked him for
[1:22:50] everything next thing there was this big
[1:22:53] bang on the window
[1:22:55] we lived upstairs the window was pushed
[1:22:58] from inside open with a scratching noise
[1:23:01] like you would throw a big dog through
[1:23:05] the window she said today we'll just
[1:23:07] lift
[1:23:08] he did there was peace in that house
[1:23:10] after their why did it happen because
[1:23:14] the perservere asked why why not Lord
[1:23:20] ever done anything wrong ever done
[1:23:22] anything wrong I want to repent I want
[1:23:25] to see you work manifest in my life we
[1:23:29] have to ask why isn't it
[1:23:30] and sometimes it's such a little thing
[1:23:34] you wouldn't believe it and for me once
[1:23:36] I sit there and I lost the peace my
[1:23:39] peace I knew it's wrong I should have a
[1:23:41] peace that passes all understanding
[1:23:42] didn't heaven there's the Lord whatever
[1:23:44] done I want to repent concede that I've
[1:23:47] done anything wrong I pray for three
[1:23:50] weeks in the middle of a prayer he said
[1:23:55] my plans not your plans you know I had
[1:23:59] wonderful planes wonderful planes and
[1:24:02] look in the middle of the prayer I
[1:24:04] almost smiled I mean I probably did I
[1:24:07] said Lord well that's the only horrible
[1:24:10] thing I did you know it was a horrible
[1:24:12] thing
[1:24:12] it was my plane my ways and all his
[1:24:16] voice you know as a father sometimes you
[1:24:19] want to be looking after your family and
[1:24:22] do things you do it in your own strength
[1:24:24] I was wrong I said Lord your plants of
[1:24:28] course your planes I don't care what
[1:24:30] happens and you know he place is so rich
[1:24:32] list that peace came back in but you
[1:24:35] know ask why not what what is seek God
[1:24:40] until you know don't blame him or don't
[1:24:43] think the word is not true or I'm not
[1:24:46] his that's why he doesn't answer no it's
[1:24:48] not that there's something hindering the
[1:24:50] leadership of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:24:52] know we read all these things to know it
[1:24:56] help people so easily forfeit the
[1:25:00] leadership with the Holy Ghost for
[1:25:01] something tangible they can see and you
[1:25:04] know that looks impressive but it's not
[1:25:07] it's not just closes this one you know
[1:25:14] sometimes we can end up being
[1:25:16] sympathizers with past work of God
[1:25:20] a past work and you know brother Brown
[1:25:24] puts it this way is like his paint it's
[1:25:26] fire one day somebody really good warm
[1:25:29] and and and you know week we can say
[1:25:32] wonderful painting beautiful painter
[1:25:35] fire almost feel the heat of it you know
[1:25:37] it's so good you know and and I know the
[1:25:40] author I don't know who painted it I
[1:25:42] know that was about 27 years ago he did
[1:25:44] their painting you know but he don't get
[1:25:47] warm on that painting
[1:25:49] and you know when when Elijah is show
[1:25:52] down there all the things in place the
[1:25:56] same old does the same everything
[1:25:57] sacrifice and talk but there Gothia
[1:26:00] dances real fire escort you see and that
[1:26:03] is really really what is our portion the
[1:26:08] real fire the real Holy Ghost and I I
[1:26:11] just want encourage you tonight
[1:26:13] don't don't don't just say oh well might
[1:26:19] be my lord
[1:26:21] it's know you a lot he said I want to
[1:26:24] give you life and life more abundantly
[1:26:26] that's what he says so it's not my lot I
[1:26:32] turned on a message of a brother amid a
[1:26:36] few years ago just briefly and ease it
[1:26:40] all I've got three sons we don't follow
[1:26:42] the Lord I thought that said you know I
[1:26:46] that is said it hurts a man or a father
[1:26:51] if the sons don't follow the Lord but
[1:26:54] you know before they reject the Lord
[1:26:56] they reject the leadership of the father
[1:26:59] his hope and then you know you cannot
[1:27:03] reject the family and those rejecting
[1:27:06] God God put it in place so it said it
[1:27:10] said but there's also promises and we
[1:27:14] always had Priya how we pray and we see
[1:27:18] the prayers answered we claim the things
[1:27:20] of God we claimed them because it's in
[1:27:23] the word and we believe the word and we
[1:27:25] act upon it we act upon our confession
[1:27:28] so we know just sympathizers we will
[1:27:32] actually go with it
[1:27:34] just finished with this quote here the
[1:27:37] Spirit of God can be identified by its
[1:27:41] characteristics the Spirit of God and
[1:27:44] the spirit of the church there is a
[1:27:47] church spirit and the Spirit of God
[1:27:49] that's absolutely not like the truth
[1:27:52] spirit at all there is a denominational
[1:27:56] spirit and like I said we can have it
[1:27:59] just ourselves
[1:28:00] it's another church that's faltering we
[1:28:03] can have it ourselves I know everything
[1:28:06] you know nothing you know we can have it
[1:28:08] ourselves but let's just surrender all
[1:28:11] our old ways to Jesus Christ declare him
[1:28:16] like Paul affirming that he's alive and
[1:28:19] if he is alive he knows everything our
[1:28:24] thoughts our motives our cries of our
[1:28:28] hearts he knows everything
[1:28:31] let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord is
[1:28:35] so much we can say and we can try to
[1:28:38] took place before for people but lower
[1:28:42] unless your Holy Spirit comes and makes
[1:28:44] it a reality in our lives it's just
[1:28:47] words and I just pray Lord let us all
[1:28:50] experience you to be alive in our lives
[1:28:53] even as we leave this place knowing you
[1:28:55] the Living God and and putting our lives
[1:29:00] before you Lord you know every detail of
[1:29:02] it we don't need to explain it you know
[1:29:05] everything let us all just surrender all
[1:29:09] our lives to you Lord and say lead us
[1:29:14] Lord Jesus by your Holy Spirit ask that
[1:29:18] you would do that Lord I pray that you
[1:29:21] would meet the needs of everyone here
[1:29:24] Lord there is there is always needs and
[1:29:27] we sometimes don't realize what is in
[1:29:30] need and what is there for our good and
[1:29:32] and we try to understand it but we don't
[1:29:36] but you know all things you're in heaven
[1:29:38] we are on the earth Lord you know all
[1:29:40] things and I just want to commit
[1:29:42] ourselves and our needs into your hands
[1:29:46] and ask you to undertake in a name of
[1:29:49] Jesus Christ amen amen

[1:29:56] wonderful it's wonderful I just don't
[1:29:59] know how to you know I don't know when
[1:30:03] he comes sometimes he comes down and
[1:30:05] sometimes he comes down when you go home
[1:30:08] sometimes when you pray but he is the
[1:30:10] Living God and I can declare to you he
[1:30:13] is alive I've met him

[1:38:26] he wants yeah you know it's it's oh just
[1:38:31] give you one one more example you may
[1:38:34] relate to this I when I came back to New
[1:38:37] Zealand I was looking for a job I had
[1:38:40] three job offers in Rotorua and I didn't
[1:38:44] want to go into Rotorua to work I wanted
[1:38:46] to live in Tara
[1:38:48] but then after had three job offers
[1:38:51] there and none in Tauranga a pride said
[1:38:53] lord if it's your well that I'm in
[1:38:56] Rotorua I'll go to Rotorua but you know
[1:38:59] I preferred to be in tirana if it's okay
[1:39:02] for me to meet Tara please let me have a
[1:39:05] job by Wednesday then old biddy on you
[1:39:10] said to me why don't you ring a travel
[1:39:13] agent he traveled so much I said well I
[1:39:16] drink a lot of milk doesn't make me a
[1:39:18] dairy farmer you know and but then I
[1:39:22] thought well might as well throw a ring
[1:39:24] at regulation and I had an interview
[1:39:26] straightaway and they had a job by
[1:39:28] Wednesday so I was you see the Lord
[1:39:32] doesn't force you through things but he
[1:39:35] looks for willingness to do and if we
[1:39:38] are willing to surrender our lives to
[1:39:44] deliver if the Holy Ghost
[1:39:45] should we just pray together as a
[1:39:48] congregation you know should we all
[1:39:53] raise our hands to Lord
[1:39:55] Heavenly Father Almighty God you know
[1:39:59] our hearts our lives our needs our every
[1:40:03] burden that we have Lord we want to
[1:40:05] surrender it all to you we surrender our
[1:40:08] hearts and lives
[1:40:10] fresh and in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:12] for a cleansing and Lord for your spirit
[1:40:16] to come in our lives to guide and lead
[1:40:18] us and Lord you want to rededicate our
[1:40:20] lives to you surrender all our wishes
[1:40:24] and desires into your hands Lord ooh you
[1:40:27] know what
[1:40:27] for us we want to have you will we want
[1:40:31] to be in a perfect will of God in Jesus
[1:40:34] Christ's name I ask that you make our
[1:40:36] hearts sensitive Lord if any one of us
[1:40:39] grief your spirit in the past forgive us
[1:40:42] for grieving your spirit and heal this
[1:40:44] and make a sensitive again to the
[1:40:47] leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord he
[1:40:50] come gentle as a dove he don't force
[1:40:52] yourself upon us Lord let us know when
[1:40:56] you move in our lives and respond and
[1:40:58] see the glory of God revealed in our own
[1:41:01] lives I just prayed a special anointing
[1:41:03] upon each one of us here that you will
[1:41:06] come and use us for the glory of God
[1:41:09] lower to to give us the assurance that
[1:41:11] we are in a perfect will of God Lord
[1:41:14] direct us and Lord if he stepped out of
[1:41:16] line we ask forgive us and we repent in
[1:41:20] the name of Jesus Christ and we say come
[1:41:23] Lord Jesus come Holy Spirit fearless
[1:41:26] leaders guide us for your glory in Jesus
[1:41:30] name I pray amen amen
[1:41:32] god bless you all it's wonderful to
[1:41:36] encourage one another you know it
[1:41:38] sometimes we can do it sometimes we
[1:41:42] can't but look what what better thing is
[1:41:45] there then just being in the will of God
[1:41:48] being led by the Lord you know I always
[1:41:51] say look even a little child who is led
[1:41:54] by the Lord brings out more wisdom and
[1:41:58] and things then then somebody who thinks
[1:42:01] they know everything if someone just
[1:42:05] obeys and is sensitive the leaders
[1:42:07] of the Holy Spirit and you know it's
[1:42:09] given to us and just remember and
[1:42:13] declare like pour believe he's alive and
[1:42:18] we declare him alive and that really
[1:42:21] helps it's always the crunch do we
