[3:21] holy ghost is fire itself that's right
[3:24] they'd bring them out and we will burn
[3:27] that religion right out of them we will
[3:29] make them bow down
[3:31] I can hear Shadrach and meshach and
[3:33] abednego starting up their game plank
[3:35] they're going starting up a gangplank
[3:38] they're going to drop off into the
[3:41] furnace I can hear Shadrach say brother

[3:59] furnace but nevertheless if you don't do
[4:01] it will not bow down to your image amen
[4:05] hallelujah
[4:07] I'll not bow down to your image they
[4:10] walked a few feet further my looked like
[4:13] God was unconcerned about it and I can
[4:16] see the man with the spears the intense
[4:18] heat was just about to get them they
[4:21] were just about to suffocate Shadrach
[4:22] Meshach and Abednego kind of faintly
[4:25] like walking on hands tied behind them
[4:29] going right into the fiery furnace
[4:30] taking the last step of the way I can
[4:33] see them now where they just about let's
[4:36] dramatize this a little I can see them
[4:38] where they just about the one step from
[4:41] going into the fiery furnace the only
[4:43] person gets in a hurry as you and I God
[4:46] takes his time as long as he's promised
[4:48] it that's good enough all right I can
[4:51] see them right up there almost ready to
[4:54] step into the fiery furnace then look it
[4:56] looks pretty bad for believers there
[4:58] they the old King sits well well
[5:01] we'll stop them them holy rollers around

[5:06] under control as as soon as they hit
[5:09] that fiery furnace the rest of these

[47:01] I mean who loves the Lord this morning
[47:13] praise the Lord let's go to yes so the
[47:16] book of Philemon right the end of the
[47:17] you know at the end of the scripture not
[47:19] a not a but not a book that I guess
[47:21] really Minister on a lot but if we go to
[47:28] Philemon 4 and verses from 4 to 7 or say
[47:32] I mean when you are there all right so
[47:34] that's read and so the Apostle Paul
[47:36] speaking to Philemon he says I think I
[47:38] think my god making mention of the
[47:41] always in my prayers hearing of thy love
[47:43] and faith which thou has towards the
[47:46] Lord Jesus and toward All Saints that
[47:49] the communication of thy faith may
[47:51] become official by the acknowledging of
[47:55] every good thing which is in you in
[47:58] Christ Jesus for we have great joy and
[48:01] consolation in thy love because the
[48:03] bowels of the Saints are refreshed by
[48:06] the brother
[48:08] Amy unless bow eating a word of Prayer
[48:11] gracious Eternal Lord Jesus Oh Lord how

[49:28] the Apostle Paul is speaking here to
[49:32] Philemon and and and and we can see from
[49:35] his writings that Philemon is not an
[49:37] unbeliever he's not a even to make
[49:39] believer but this man is a believer he
[49:41] you know as the Apostle Paul is thanking
[49:44] the Lord for Philemon love and faith I
[49:48] mean and because of this we can sit in
[49:50] and port the Apostle Paul heard of his
[49:52] love and faith so so Philemon had a
[49:56] testimony Amen that he was a believer
[49:58] and his love and faith impacted those
[50:00] around him and we can if we just I'm
[50:03] just gonna wade through this and see how
[50:05] we go but I trust you know we could the
[50:07] devil can disable our faith where we can
[50:10] become ineffective we can still be a
[50:12] believable you still being sealed into
[50:13] the kingdom I mean still on our way to
[50:15] glory but we can be ineffective we can
[50:17] be disabled and this is what I want to
[50:20] speak against we want our faith to be
[50:22] official I mean so so when the Apostle
[50:25] Paul is saying that I heard of thy love
[50:28] and faith this word love that he speaks
[50:31] offers agape love so let's see it's a
[50:34] and and the word agape is a Greek Oh
[50:36] Christian term referring to the highest
[50:38] for
[50:38] of love charity it's the love of God for
[50:41] man and of man for God so it's not a
[50:44] it's not a brotherly love is not a
[50:46] feeling of love we'd call it which is
[50:48] you know brotherly love based on how you
[50:50] love treat me that's how I'll treat you
[50:52] in return you know so if you love me
[50:54] I'll love you and return that as a
[50:55] brotherly love or a filial love but
[50:57] God's love is not that way God's love is
[51:00] constant it doesn't change it doesn't
[51:01] diminish it doesn't even get greater I
[51:03] mean but as love has been fully
[51:05] expressed it's not based on it on our
[51:07] behavior not based on what we do Amen if
[51:10] he loved you he loved you right but it's
[51:13] now our our response that love is what
[51:15] matters I mean so you know you read in
[51:18] the book of you know you know because
[51:20] many people must understand the love of
[51:23] God and God's love is shown towards this
[51:26] believer by his election as brother
[51:29] Brown would say in this moon of church
[51:31] age this is now the Lord God Almighty
[51:32] says I know for he is walking in the
[51:36] midst of his people there he is the
[51:38] chief Shepherd of the flock but does he
[51:40] hold back the persecution does he stem
[51:42] the tribulation no he does not he simply
[51:45] says I know your tribulation I am not at
[51:48] all unmindful of your suffering what a
[51:50] stumbling block that is to so many
[51:51] people like Israel they wonder if God
[51:54] really loves them how can God be just
[51:57] and loving if he stands by and watches
[51:59] his people suffer that is what they
[52:01] asked in Malachi 1 verses 1 to 3 the
[52:04] burden of the word of the Lord to Israel
[52:06] by Malachi I have loved you say at the
[52:09] Lord yet you say we're in hell we're in
[52:12] has they loved us was not Jacob and was
[52:14] not Esau Jacob's brother said the Lord
[52:17] yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and
[52:19] laid his mountains and his heritage
[52:21] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[52:23] you see they could not figure out God's
[52:25] love they thought that love meant no
[52:27] suffering who thinks that Amen we know
[52:30] we we must understand the love of God
[52:32] amen
[52:33] so you think no suffering they thought
[52:35] that love meant a baby with parental
[52:37] care but God said that his love was
[52:39] elective love I mean we think love is
[52:42] you like your children you want to keep
[52:43] them from all evil you want to keep them
[52:45] from all hardship you want to keep them
[52:46] from all suffering but that's not the
[52:48] love of God and I didn't expect the
[52:51] hallelujah
[52:52] you know but you know that is you know
[52:55] so many times you know it's such a
[52:56] battle we think does God really love us
[52:58] because we must understand his love his
[53:01] love has shown an election the proof of
[53:04] his love is continue on with the quote
[53:05] the proof of his love is election not
[53:08] met not no matter what happened his love
[53:10] was proven truly by the fact that they
[53:13] were chosen unto salvation because God
[53:15] has chosen you to salvation through
[53:17] sanctification of the Spirit and belief
[53:19] of the truth he may commit you to death
[53:22] as he did Paul he may commit you to
[53:23] suffering as he did job that is his
[53:25] prerogative he is sovereign but it is
[53:28] all with the purpose if he did not have
[53:30] a purpose that he would be the author of
[53:32] frustration or not of peace his purpose
[53:35] is that after we have suffered a while
[53:36] we would be made perfect be established
[53:39] strengthened and settled amen who wants
[53:41] to be made perfect establish strengthen
[53:43] them settle hallelujah so after we have
[53:45] suffered a while that will be the case
[53:47] as job said he put strength in us job 23
[53:51] 6 the be power verse you see he himself
[53:54] suffered he learned obedience by the
[53:56] things that he suffered he was actually
[53:58] made perfect by the things that he
[54:00] suffered Hebrews 5:8 2:9 though he were
[54:02] a son yet learned he obedience by the
[54:05] things which he suffered and being made
[54:06] perfect he became the author of eternal
[54:08] salvation unto all them that obey Him in
[54:11] plain language the very character of
[54:14] Jesus was perfected by suffering and
[54:16] according to Paul he has left us Church
[54:18] a measure of suffering that they to by
[54:21] their faith in God while suffering for
[54:23] him would be come to a place of
[54:25] perfection why did he want this James
[54:28] 1:2 and for my brethren count it all joy
[54:30] when you fall into divers temptations
[54:32] doing this that the trying of your faith
[54:34] worketh patience but their patience have
[54:37] a perfect work that ye may be perfect
[54:39] and entire wanting nothing Amen so God
[54:45] if he chose me he chose me if I'm
[54:47] elected he loves me
[54:49] amen he said well I don't know if I'm
[54:50] elected I I'd come anyway hallelujah
[54:53] some people say well if I'm there I'm
[54:55] there if I'm not I'm not that's just
[54:56] unbelief
[54:57] Jesus did all of the Father Kay your has
[54:59] given me will come to me and all that
[55:01] country or no wise cast out so I just
[55:03] say here Lord I Here I am
[55:05] I'm coming home father holy that means
[55:07] he won't cast you out so Philemon was
[55:09] known for expressing the love of God and
[55:11] also for his faith I'm basically
[55:13] building a case because some people if
[55:15] you say oh of my faith got to be a
[55:17] fictional some people think well I've
[55:18] got the Holy Ghost therefore my faith is
[55:20] effectual oh no it depends on you right
[55:25] so so I'm wanting to build the case here
[55:26] with Philemon I'm basically trying to be
[55:28] a lawyer today here's my case what's
[55:30] your verdict it'll either be owe me or
[55:33] praise the Lord or maybe a mixture I
[55:34] don't know but see so Philemon was known
[55:36] for expressing the love of God and also
[55:39] for his faith now we understand that
[55:42] faith is a revelation brother Branham
[55:43] would sound first his and works as faith
[55:47] expressed he says now faith is a
[55:48] revelation from God now faith is a
[55:50] revelation that's where I want to stay
[55:52] for just a moment it's a revelation he
[55:54] has revealed it to you by His grace it's
[55:56] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[55:58] up into faith you never have faith it
[56:00] give to you by the grace of God and God
[56:03] reveals it to you therefore faith is a
[56:05] revelation and the whole Church of God
[56:07] is built upon revelation a Baptist
[56:10] minister told me not long ago he said I
[56:12] I just cannot accept revelation I said
[56:14] then you cannot accept the Bible you
[56:16] cannot accept Christ because he is the
[56:18] revelation of God he's God's River he's
[56:21] God revealed in flesh therefore the
[56:22] whole church is built upon divine
[56:24] revelation
[56:25] jesus said - I believe was - Peter said
[56:28] what do does mean say I the Son of Man
[56:30] and he was talking to his disciples and
[56:33] some of them said you're Elias or Moses
[56:34] or one of the prophets in Jeremiah but
[56:37] he said who do you say he says thou art
[56:39] the Christ the Son of the Living God
[56:40] now the Roman Catholic Church is here
[56:42] speaking to Peter upon this rock I'll
[56:44] build my church
[56:45] the Protestants say he was building it
[56:47] upon himself now they could be right but
[56:49] to me both of them's wrong it was upon
[56:52] the spiritual revelation of who he was
[56:54] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[56:57] you Peter but my father which is in
[56:59] heaven has revealed us to you and upon
[57:01] this rock the revelation of who he is
[57:03] upon the revelation he is the word in
[57:05] the hole upon this rock I'll build my
[57:07] church and the gates of Hell cannot
[57:09] prevail against it it showed the gates
[57:11] of Hell wood would be against it amen so
[57:14] therefore you're the whole our Christian
[57:16] walk is based upon Revelation
[57:18] it's not upon what we learn your jesus
[57:20] said very simply to Peter no one told
[57:23] you this it wasn't because it was the
[57:25] public opinion or maybe talk to the
[57:27] disciples or you know but God told you
[57:29] this
[57:30] my father shouldn't even revealed this
[57:32] to you that I am the Christ I mean it's
[57:34] the same thing with you and I the same
[57:35] question is always placed in front of
[57:37] the people who do you say this word is I
[57:40] mean who do you say it is is it just a
[57:41] healing ministry is it just to even a
[57:43] prophet but it's more than a prophet
[57:45] I'm it's more than a healing ministry
[57:47] amen but as the word become manifested
[57:49] it is Jesus Christ coming out of history
[57:52] revealing himself to you I mean you're
[57:54] gonna have that revelation if it's been
[57:56] revealed to you this is more than
[57:57] william branham speaking but it's God
[57:59] Himself speaking I mean then you're
[58:01] built upon the rock of revelation
[58:03] hollien you're built where the church is
[58:05] being built I mean you're part of that
[58:07] church hallelujah so Philemon had
[58:09] revelation so here's a man know isn't
[58:13] that wonderful wouldn't you want to have
[58:14] that kind of you know
[58:18] Philemon appears to be a modal believer
[58:20] in here's wouldn't you thank the Lord
[58:22] for the work he has done in your life if
[58:25] you are known by your love and faith
[58:26] when you say Lord you're working widely
[58:29] in me you brought me out of the pit and
[58:31] you've placed me on a rock and you've
[58:33] transformed my life because this is the
[58:35] testimony I have and it's not me it's
[58:36] you doing it in me wouldn't you rejoice
[58:39] amen but notice now Philemon
[58:43] verse 6 but Paul is desiring that the
[58:46] communication of his faith may become
[58:48] effectual I mean by the acknowledging of
[58:51] every good thing which is in you in
[58:53] Christ Jesus now this word communication
[58:56] I trust you don't mind me go through
[58:58] some definitions but this word means
[59:00] partnership it means a participation it
[59:03] means a distribution and it means a it
[59:07] means a communion and then this word
[59:11] official it means to be active that
[59:14] means to be powerful it means to be
[59:17] operative so the Apostle Paul is
[59:20] acknowledging yes the Lord
[59:22] yes Philemon you have a yes you have the
[59:26] love of God yes you have
[59:28] revelation Philemon but I desire that
[59:30] the communication or the part
[59:32] the ship the distribution of your faith
[59:33] would become active it become powerful
[59:36] to become operative I mean it wouldn't
[59:38] be it wouldn't be disabled it wouldn't
[59:39] be neutral it wouldn't just sit there
[59:41] dormant but have been living and be
[59:43] manifest you'll be bubbling for holier
[59:45] that's what his desire was that his
[59:47] faith would be effectual who wants to
[59:48] fix your face hello he wants to really
[59:51] Lord Lord come come bubble out of me I
[59:54] mean that people would receive a culture
[59:56] and color it's not because of our
[59:57] ability it's God that would bubbles fall
[1:00:00] hallelujah for one another I mean for
[1:00:02] this this world is thirsty
[1:00:04] I mean spiritually it is dying is it
[1:00:07] there's a drought I mean but the but the
[1:00:09] believer hallelujah has an artesian well
[1:00:12] bubbling forth as it has an
[1:00:14] inexhaustible fountain I mean is in the
[1:00:16] believer hallelujah if Christ is in you
[1:00:18] you have the fountain in you but we need
[1:00:21] it to bubble forth and it what's the
[1:00:24] good having all the water in the world
[1:00:26] and it's not even being distributed amen
[1:00:30] hallelujah you take many parts of the
[1:00:33] world it can be raining a whole bunch in
[1:00:35] one part and it can be severe droughts
[1:00:37] in another part all they need is a big
[1:00:38] pot to transfer it and there wouldn't be
[1:00:41] a drought same thing with you and I they
[1:00:45] men so he sang him play in English
[1:00:51] Philemon I desire your life would have
[1:00:53] an impact it would change lives for the
[1:00:55] kingdom of God now the devil doesn't
[1:00:57] want us to be effective for the kingdom
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:01] he wants to disable our walk so that
[1:01:03] even though we know the Lord we can end
[1:01:06] up totally ineffective I don't want to
[1:01:09] be that kind of way but it can happen
[1:01:12] spirit filled believers can be disabled
[1:01:14] crippled up and that's what the devil
[1:01:17] wants us to be brother Brent brother
[1:01:20] Brandon would say and why Christ speak
[1:01:22] as in 1963 see the preachers today seem
[1:01:25] to want to make their churches like some
[1:01:28] kind of modernistic Lodge of some sort
[1:01:30] membership and so forth they see the
[1:01:32] possibilities of maybe becoming a bishop
[1:01:34] or a general overseer or something like
[1:01:36] that if they will go along with the
[1:01:38] church forsaking the scriptures when
[1:01:39] it's laying right there before them were
[1:01:42] thoroughly a vindicated by the power of
[1:01:43] God and by the Living
[1:01:45] of God living in the people yet they
[1:01:47] don't want it they say we don't want to
[1:01:49] get mixed up with something like that
[1:01:50] that would take their fellowship card
[1:01:52] that would make did take the
[1:01:55] denominational order yet honest men like
[1:01:57] lot sitting down and Sodom knowing that
[1:02:00] that it's wrong see what do they do when
[1:02:03] they do that they paralyze the little
[1:02:05] faith that they did have it can't work I
[1:02:09] mean because that you know the Bible
[1:02:11] says that the that that the life in
[1:02:13] Sodom and Gomorrha vexed lots righteous
[1:02:15] soul he was righteous compared to Sodom
[1:02:18] and Gomorrah but a victim but it
[1:02:19] actually his faith became disabled by
[1:02:21] where he was living
[1:02:22] he didn't make an impact he didn't he
[1:02:25] didn't win anyone he didn't get them to
[1:02:27] turn their you know from their wicked
[1:02:28] ways yet though he set in the gate I
[1:02:30] mean so he was you know he was a mayor
[1:02:32] of the city he was in a place of power
[1:02:35] and authority but yet his life as
[1:02:37] Christian testimony had no impact
[1:02:39] whatsoever on on the people even his own
[1:02:42] sons and laws would laugh at him when he
[1:02:45] would speak them say look these angels
[1:02:46] have come I mean they're pulling us out
[1:02:48] of this place because God is gonna burn
[1:02:50] this burn this world
[1:02:52] I hear crackly something going on up
[1:02:54] here you know we were singing and the
[1:02:56] thing just turned on it seemed to be it
[1:02:59] had a lot I didn't touch anything by the
[1:03:00] way anyway you know so so that has his
[1:03:03] walk his testimony was totally know and
[1:03:07] if an ineffective I mean because it was
[1:03:11] paralyzed by where he was now Moses he
[1:03:17] said so but Moses he says his faith
[1:03:20] paralyzed the world
[1:03:21] I mean his faith paralyzed Egypt the
[1:03:25] greatest superpower in the day and one
[1:03:27] man with revelation of who God was of
[1:03:29] what God was doing gonna say paralyzed
[1:03:32] at all total Empire hallelujah that's
[1:03:35] how powerful his faith was and if that
[1:03:38] is faith under the blood of bulls and
[1:03:39] goats how much more the faith under the
[1:03:41] blood of Jesus Christ and where our
[1:03:43] people are looked up to be joint heirs
[1:03:44] with Christ hallelujah how much more
[1:03:47] that kind of faith he says either your
[1:03:50] faith will paralyze glamour or either
[1:03:53] glamour will paralyze your faith now you
[1:03:56] have to take one or the other
[1:03:59] and you see the Bible don't change God
[1:04:01] don't change he's the unchangeable God
[1:04:03] so either this world we talked about
[1:04:05] glamour this world will paralyze you
[1:04:08] oh you your faith will paralyze the
[1:04:10] world I want my faith to paralyze the
[1:04:13] world I want what Jesus died for to be
[1:04:16] fully manifested in my life I don't want
[1:04:18] to just scrape in by the skin of my
[1:04:20] teeth I want I want to be an overcomer
[1:04:22] holy because the overcomers said in his
[1:04:24] throne I mean that's how I want to be
[1:04:27] now let's go to 2nd Timothy and in verse
[1:04:30] 1 I want to show you another oh no I
[1:04:34] want to go through Timothy's here the
[1:04:38] Apostle Paul is as addressing something
[1:04:40] very specific would it be amazing for
[1:04:42] the messenger to write to you personally
[1:04:45] hallelujah and God's written to us
[1:04:47] personally amen
[1:04:49] hell yeah 2nd Timothy 1 and 1 Paul an
[1:04:54] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:04:56] God according to the promise of life
[1:04:58] which is in Christ Jesus
[1:05:01] 2 Timothy my dearly beloved son grace
[1:05:05] mercy and peace from God the Father in
[1:05:08] Christ Jesus our Lord I thank God whom I
[1:05:10] serve from my forefathers with pure
[1:05:13] conscience that without ceasing I have
[1:05:16] remembrance of thee in my prayers night
[1:05:18] and day greatly desiring to see thee
[1:05:21] being mindful of thy tears that I may be
[1:05:23] filled with joy when I call to
[1:05:25] remembrance the unfeigned which means
[1:05:28] sincere faith that is in thee which
[1:05:30] dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and
[1:05:33] thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded
[1:05:35] that is in thee also wherefore I put
[1:05:39] thee in remembrance too that thou stir
[1:05:42] up which means to rekindle the gift of
[1:05:45] God which is in thee by the putting on
[1:05:47] of my hands for God has not called us
[1:05:49] and it has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:05:52] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:05:54] mind be not thou therefore ashamed of
[1:05:56] the testimony of our Lord nor of me his
[1:05:59] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[1:06:01] afflictions of the Gospel according to
[1:06:03] the power of God now we know Timothy was
[1:06:07] a believer
[1:06:07] hello believers how we today I mean he
[1:06:10] was a believer and he was not only a
[1:06:12] but he was a spirit-filled believer that
[1:06:15] had a ministry gift so he was part of
[1:06:17] the fivefold ministry in his day he was
[1:06:20] a son in the faith of the Apostle Paul
[1:06:22] Holley he was raised under the tutelage
[1:06:25] of the Apostle Paul but yet the Apostle
[1:06:28] Paul was prompted by the Lord to write
[1:06:30] to him to encourage him to rekindle the
[1:06:33] gift of God in his life so something had
[1:06:36] happened to Timothy that was the devil
[1:06:38] was trying to disable the gift in his
[1:06:41] life that God could not anoint that gift
[1:06:43] and use it because we must understand
[1:06:45] everyone is gifted in this room
[1:06:47] it's not just a preacher the song leader
[1:06:49] the musician the deacon whoever it may
[1:06:51] be we're all gifted we've all been given
[1:06:53] a gift hallelujah and every gift
[1:06:55] complements together the whole bodies
[1:06:57] must function in unity I mean that God
[1:06:59] can manifest himself through a mini many
[1:07:01] membered body I mean so now there so now
[1:07:04] here as the devil has come against
[1:07:06] Timothy to try and disable the gift in
[1:07:08] his life hallelujah and then how does
[1:07:11] this come in I mean well you know
[1:07:13] disappointment comes and people come the
[1:07:15] devil comes against you hallelujah he
[1:07:18] would Timothy would have faced
[1:07:19] opposition he would have faced the same
[1:07:21] opposition appeal the Apostle Paul faced
[1:07:23] and it affected him in such a way that
[1:07:27] it that instead of letting God use the
[1:07:29] gift in his life because brother Graham
[1:07:31] says what's the greatest gift get
[1:07:33] yourself out of the way that God can
[1:07:35] come in and manifest himself however he
[1:07:37] wants to manifest himself I say Lord I
[1:07:39] want to get myself out the way that you
[1:07:41] can take the gift of faith whatever gift
[1:07:44] you have a man and God can use it
[1:07:46] hallelujah because we have to surrender
[1:07:48] I mean we cannot be effectual for the
[1:07:51] kingdom if we are not surrendered and he
[1:07:53] said but I gave my eyes the Lord many
[1:07:55] years ago but have you taken it back
[1:07:56] again I mean because of circumstance
[1:07:59] because of hardship because of trials
[1:08:00] because of misunderstandings or
[1:08:02] unforgiveness or resentment whatever it
[1:08:04] may be have you taken it back again amen
[1:08:08] they met just like brother Tim fruit
[1:08:10] said he's like sixty odd years old I
[1:08:12] guess he said at five years old I gave
[1:08:14] my heart to the Lord I never took her
[1:08:15] back hallelujah and that's how we should
[1:08:18] be I gave her half the law I never took
[1:08:20] it back I mean cuz if he has your heart
[1:08:22] if he has your desires your affections
[1:08:24] everything that you are
[1:08:25] then God could anoint the gift in your
[1:08:27] life and you can be official in the body
[1:08:29] wherever God has placed you to be I mean
[1:08:33] so the Apostle Paul is addressing this
[1:08:35] and you know he's he's addressing
[1:08:38] Timothy that the enemy though he's
[1:08:41] trying to disable the gift of disable
[1:08:44] the gift of God in his life
[1:08:45] ami but Timothy wouldn't allow it to
[1:08:48] happen
[1:08:49] hallelujah hey the devil doesn't want us
[1:08:53] to be effective do you think he was
[1:08:55] happy when when when the day of
[1:08:57] Pentecost happened and you know the
[1:08:58] church just was birth gloriously why do
[1:09:01] you think they you know you you know you
[1:09:03] read through the Gospels as says they
[1:09:05] wanted to stone Jesus and throw him down
[1:09:07] the cliff and all these things the
[1:09:08] apostles were with them why didn't they
[1:09:11] try and stone the apostles and throw
[1:09:12] them down cliffs and kill them because
[1:09:14] the life of God wasn't in them yet
[1:09:16] they're with the son of man they're
[1:09:18] walking with them they were believers
[1:09:19] but yet that same life wasn't in them
[1:09:21] but then when the day of Pentecost came
[1:09:23] that same God came and dwelt on them and
[1:09:25] God manifests himself through 120 and
[1:09:28] the gospel spread and then where'd the
[1:09:29] persecution go against the apostles
[1:09:31] workers God or where the sorry the devil
[1:09:34] always tries to snuff out the life of
[1:09:36] God and man that's why they were they
[1:09:38] were brought before the Sanhedrin and
[1:09:40] the council they were threatened don't
[1:09:41] preach in this name anymore don't do
[1:09:43] these things no more and they just said
[1:09:45] who are we going to serve are we going
[1:09:47] to please God or man you tell us they
[1:09:49] say we're just going to please God and
[1:09:50] they came together after that they had a
[1:09:52] prayer meeting God came down shook the
[1:09:54] house refilled them I mean wash that
[1:09:56] complex out of their life and now given
[1:09:58] god i'm boldness and they went out and
[1:09:59] preached again hallelujah that's why
[1:10:02] it's so important to have a pre-meeting
[1:10:03] the devil tries to come against you just
[1:10:05] get into the prince of god stand in his
[1:10:08] presence amen God can come and mold and
[1:10:10] change you hallelujah that's so
[1:10:12] important it's not about trying to work
[1:10:15] out the solution he is the solution
[1:10:17] I mean God is a solution hallelujah Amen
[1:10:22] so so that so Timothy he was told by
[1:10:25] told by the Apostle Paul he says Timothy
[1:10:28] I remember the sincere faith that was in
[1:10:31] your grandmother that was in your mother
[1:10:33] and now I believe that faith is in you
[1:10:36] that unfeigned means sincere how it
[1:10:39] genuine faith I mean I believe what I
[1:10:42] saw in them that's in you and I want you
[1:10:45] to remember I mean what when when the
[1:10:48] Lord went from being their testimony
[1:10:50] from their story I mean it went from
[1:10:52] being his grandmother stirring his
[1:10:53] mother's story then that same God of his
[1:10:56] grandmother and mother became his God I
[1:10:58] mean it became his testimony I mean that
[1:11:00] guy became living in Hamlin
[1:11:02] I mean Timothy I want you to remember
[1:11:03] the day when the wood became a life to
[1:11:05] you it was more than some Scrolls more
[1:11:07] than just someone preaching and been the
[1:11:09] same God became living in your life I
[1:11:11] want you to remember that day I want you
[1:11:13] to stir up that gift bring to
[1:11:15] remembrance what happened to you
[1:11:17] hallelujah and that's what we must do I
[1:11:19] mean the devil tries to come against us
[1:11:20] going back through your testimony stir
[1:11:23] up remembrance what he did I think those
[1:11:25] of God called you back there he's not
[1:11:27] gonna drop you here he's going to take
[1:11:29] you all the way hallelujah that's why
[1:11:31] you got to stir it up don't dwell on the
[1:11:32] negative don't dwell on the situation
[1:11:35] dwell on God Drella what he has done
[1:11:37] hallelujah because he called you to put
[1:11:40] you in the army put you on the
[1:11:42] frontlines hallelujah amen sorry Timothy
[1:11:47] stir up which means to rekindle the gift
[1:11:50] of God
[1:11:51] you got to reignite it how do you
[1:11:54] recognize a fire you put you put fuel on
[1:11:57] that fire amen
[1:12:00] you don't just take your photo of it you
[1:12:02] underst what through your photos look at
[1:12:04] that wonderful fire no you put fuel on
[1:12:06] it hallelujah that's how you rekindle
[1:12:09] the fire that's being burnt down you put
[1:12:10] fuel on it you may be blown a little bit
[1:12:13] get the embas going hallelujah and then
[1:12:15] the fires going again well that sounds
[1:12:19] very lovely how do we do that exactly
[1:12:21] it's more than just going through the
[1:12:23] motions of listening to the message
[1:12:26] coming to church reading the Bible but
[1:12:28] it's a sincere prayerful desire I mean
[1:12:32] because you can have walls up you can be
[1:12:34] disabled yet go through the motions yet
[1:12:36] outwardly look like you're doing the
[1:12:37] right thing but if you're a walled up on
[1:12:39] the inside I just don't want to get hurt
[1:12:41] no more I just don't want to you know I
[1:12:43] don't want to go through that again I
[1:12:45] just I barely survived it I don't want
[1:12:47] to go through it again hallelujah you
[1:12:49] gonna have a gumption Lord if I've got
[1:12:50] to go through that battle again
[1:12:52] I mean the Apostle Paul had a lot of
[1:12:54] hardship he was shipwrecked he was
[1:12:56] beaten he was robbed people wanted to
[1:12:58] kill him I mean he he said he fought the
[1:13:00] beast at Ephesus that wasn't animals
[1:13:02] that was religious spirits and people
[1:13:04] and but he said none of these things
[1:13:06] move me wholly because he was determined
[1:13:09] I mean after he met the Lord on the road
[1:13:10] to Damascus he said you know he just
[1:13:12] clave to that visitation hallelujah that
[1:13:15] God was with him the whole way down and
[1:13:17] nothing the devil could do could disable
[1:13:19] his faith hallelujah and if that was the
[1:13:22] if that was the beginning it'll be at
[1:13:24] the end the same way
[1:13:26] hallelujah amen so it's more than just
[1:13:31] going through the motions but two
[1:13:33] sincere prayerful desire Lord speak to
[1:13:37] my heart like you did at the beginning
[1:13:38] touch my heart with your word as I hear
[1:13:41] it I don't just want to hear it in here
[1:13:43] speak you know how he speaks you it just
[1:13:44] it just throws your soul hallelujah
[1:13:47] please never had that experience I mean
[1:13:49] you may be reading the scripture just
[1:13:50] anchors down you just have a jubilee you
[1:13:52] hear the message you just have a jubilee
[1:13:54] how do you may have heard it many times
[1:13:56] but just quickens Cheers
[1:13:57] I mean you begin to rejoice God comes
[1:13:59] down in the room hallelujah
[1:14:01] well you begin to pray hallelujah and he
[1:14:05] draws near and you know you're talking
[1:14:07] to the eternal one and he's not up in
[1:14:09] heaven some places in the room with you
[1:14:11] hallelujah that's putting wood on that's
[1:14:14] putting fuel on the fire
[1:14:16] hallelujah amen
[1:14:20] see brother BAM sit in the pillar of 553
[1:14:23] sees the biggest trouble there is in the
[1:14:24] church today is a bunch of fear people
[1:14:27] always scared that's of the devil don't
[1:14:29] be scared be brave you don't have thee
[1:14:31] you've got nothing to be afraid about
[1:14:34] hallelujah brother Graham says in the
[1:14:37] revelation of Jesus Christ the church
[1:14:38] age book Christine cheese's she had
[1:14:41] shared this with me it's just blessed me
[1:14:43] so much is would you like an Old
[1:14:45] Testament type let's go back to the
[1:14:47] Garden of Eden when the first news came
[1:14:50] to glory that the son Adam had been lost
[1:14:53] at God send an angel then he seemed a
[1:14:56] son did he send another one like unto us
[1:14:59] no he came himself to redeem that lost
[1:15:01] son hallelujah God the Northern Trust
[1:15:03] his plan of salvation to another
[1:15:06] he trusted only himself God was made
[1:15:08] flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us
[1:15:11] unto himself we are saved by the blood
[1:15:13] of God the eternal God and dwells a
[1:15:16] mortal body in order to take away sin he
[1:15:18] became the lamb in order to shed his
[1:15:20] blood and enter into the Vail with it
[1:15:22] consider the sense that is the blood of
[1:15:24] God it is perfect blood and if the
[1:15:27] perfect blood is loosing us from the
[1:15:29] power and bondage into foul men of sin
[1:15:31] and then the loosing is perfect and
[1:15:34] complete there is now therefore no
[1:15:37] condemnation who shall lay anything to
[1:15:39] the charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:15:41] justifieth wish declares us righteous
[1:15:44] who is he that condemneth that is Christ
[1:15:46] that died Romans 8:33 34 there it is he
[1:15:49] his death gave us the blood the blood
[1:15:52] has loosed us there is now there is now
[1:15:55] no condemnation how can there be if
[1:15:58] there is nothing to be condemned for
[1:15:59] because the blood has Lucius from sin we
[1:16:03] are free guiltless don't listen to men
[1:16:05] listen to the word you are loosed by the
[1:16:07] blood now don't get tied down again by
[1:16:10] traditions and creeds and organizations
[1:16:12] don't be led astray by listening to
[1:16:14] those that deny the power of the word
[1:16:15] and deny that Jesus Saves heals fills
[1:16:18] with the Holy Ghost and power you are
[1:16:20] God's free men loosed by his own blood
[1:16:23] if you will still hold to your faith to
[1:16:25] creeds and denominations that will
[1:16:27] certain by the evidence that you've lost
[1:16:29] your faith in the word holy is that
[1:16:32] we've been loosed by a perfect blood and
[1:16:34] that loosing is complete it's not a
[1:16:36] partial loosing I mean it's not just on
[1:16:39] a weekend or one day of the week I mean
[1:16:40] but if you're loosed if you're free
[1:16:41] you're free I mean the hem of the Sun is
[1:16:44] set free is free indeed I mean it's a
[1:16:46] perfect sacrifice is perfectly loose - I
[1:16:48] mean from the bondage of sin from the
[1:16:51] yoke of the devil hallelujah we're free
[1:16:53] amen but it all depends though if you
[1:16:56] have faith in the word holy then he's
[1:16:58] done it for you it's not by feeling now
[1:17:00] if you feel up or down left or right but
[1:17:02] if your face is on the Word of God
[1:17:04] irrespective of how you feel how your
[1:17:06] day is going how your weeks going how
[1:17:08] your years going but you better sink it
[1:17:11] in your soul Lord I take you at your
[1:17:12] word your word says I'm free I accept my
[1:17:14] freedom I accept my pardon and I'm
[1:17:16] walking in that Liberty
[1:17:18] hallelujah but at all as I said it all
[1:17:20] depends on what you believe about what
[1:17:22] the Lord has done for you that makes the
[1:17:25] difference
[1:17:27] hallelujah you know brother Brown says
[1:17:29] how long you say for as long as you
[1:17:32] believe it
[1:17:33] how long you an overcomer for as long as
[1:17:35] you believe it I mean if you believe
[1:17:37] you'll never overcome you never will
[1:17:39] overcome if you confess defeat you'll be
[1:17:41] defeated if you confess victory you will
[1:17:43] get victory hallelujah what what comes
[1:17:47] out of here means a whole much you know
[1:17:51] if you say there's nothing to come into
[1:17:52] church there'll be nothing to come into
[1:17:54] Church for you hallelujah but those are
[1:17:56] bubbling rejoicing how wonderful it has
[1:17:58] been his presence what happens they go
[1:17:59] into his presence hallelujah
[1:18:02] now as I sit on I'm at the end of
[1:18:05] Wednesday night we must cultivate a
[1:18:07] spiritual appetite for the word I just
[1:18:09] want to go into this I mean to cultivate
[1:18:12] a piece of ground takes effort and labor
[1:18:13] but the farmer who does so sees the
[1:18:16] potential and the ground and the seed
[1:18:19] and what he can produce from it amen you
[1:18:21] see a farmer I said well I believe I'm
[1:18:23] going to get a good crop this year and
[1:18:24] they put into action what they believe
[1:18:27] now let's go to the Song of Solomon
[1:18:30] chapter 4 because the scripture declares
[1:18:35] to us that we are a garden who knows
[1:18:38] that Song of Solomon 4 and 12 say I mean
[1:18:54] when you are there do you swipe left to
[1:18:59] do
[1:19:03] see here a garden and closed I mean we
[1:19:10] don't normally preach from the Song of
[1:19:11] Solomon but it's a love story
[1:19:12] I trust you see yourself in there Holly
[1:19:15] he's writing about me and her hallelujah
[1:19:19] glory amen a garden enclosed as my
[1:19:23] sister my spouse a spring shut up a
[1:19:26] fountain sealed by plants are an orchid
[1:19:29] of pomegranates with pleasant fruits now
[1:19:31] camphor with with um spikenard spikenard
[1:19:34] and saffron calamus and and cinnamon
[1:19:37] with all trees of frankincense myrrh and
[1:19:39] aloes with all the chief spices a
[1:19:41] fountain of gardens a well of living
[1:19:43] waters and streams from lebanon awake o
[1:19:46] north wind and come thou Rippon my
[1:19:49] garden that the spices are of my flow
[1:19:51] out let my beloved come into his garden
[1:19:54] and eat his Pleasant fruits see saying
[1:19:58] that we are a garden we are a garden if
[1:20:01] we're a garden things growing gardens
[1:20:04] very elementary things growing gardens
[1:20:07] but it depends what you allow to grow is
[1:20:11] what's going to grow you know if I you
[1:20:15] go look at my lawn there's not a lot of
[1:20:20] grass in there because I don't look
[1:20:22] after it you know but what's in there
[1:20:26] growth it has a life of itself there was
[1:20:29] one time there's a pile of leaves down
[1:20:30] the side of the house is just concrete
[1:20:32] and then in this pile leaves weeds were
[1:20:34] growing out of it because there's the
[1:20:36] right atmosphere for these weeds just to
[1:20:38] grow a little pile of leafs
[1:20:39] things will grow wherever it can find
[1:20:42] it'll grow now so so in order so now
[1:20:47] this is this is us remember I said we
[1:20:49] need to get the right we need to have
[1:20:51] the right spiritual walk for Kemp to be
[1:20:55] truly effective I mean I don't want just
[1:20:58] a camp experience this year I want just
[1:21:01] choice it's going to be a step higher
[1:21:02] we're gonna have a Jubilee we're gonna
[1:21:04] have a wonderful time but what I was
[1:21:06] before camp I don't want to go back to
[1:21:08] after him I want to be higher closer
[1:21:11] walk with God I mean after camp than now
[1:21:13] right that's that's why I want to be I
[1:21:16] don't just want to
[1:21:16] well you know I don't just want to
[1:21:18] Plateau you know we're living in an age
[1:21:20] where the believers and called the
[1:21:21] plateau you take you take under Luthor
[1:21:23] the message of justification the just
[1:21:25] shall live by faith that's as high as
[1:21:27] they could live and they lived in they
[1:21:29] overcame then Wesley came with
[1:21:30] sanctification ii wherever work of grace
[1:21:32] is as high as they could live and they
[1:21:35] didn't they overcame then the
[1:21:36] Pentecostal move that's as high as the
[1:21:38] people could live they were living
[1:21:40] higher than the Lutheran's but they
[1:21:42] still that's as high as they could go
[1:21:43] but now when the Son of man has revealed
[1:21:45] the book has come open every part of the
[1:21:47] land belongs to us that means we can't
[1:21:49] Plateau unless we choose to I mean but
[1:21:53] God doesn't want us bribed just a
[1:21:55] plateau he wants her to grow mature
[1:21:57] become all I come every day yes
[1:21:59] hallelujah so if that's the case you
[1:22:02] know I want to close to walk with God
[1:22:04] after camp then now I mean it's I'm I'm
[1:22:07] giving you tools how lid don't just put
[1:22:11] it up in your garage and come once a
[1:22:12] month maybe if you're lucky and use it
[1:22:14] use it every day amen so in order for a
[1:22:18] farmer to get the most out of his garden
[1:22:20] he must have the understanding of what
[1:22:22] he's to plant the type of soil he has
[1:22:24] how much water he needs what fertilizer
[1:22:27] to use and how to get rid of pests and
[1:22:29] weeds now I want to go to proverbs 24
[1:22:33] sorry this is a bit of a Bible study but
[1:22:35] I just this is how does and proverbs 24
[1:22:39] verse 30 it speaks of a slothful man who
[1:22:45] likes the book of Proverbs lujah I tell
[1:22:49] you you read a proverb there's thirty
[1:22:50] you know there's virtually a proverb for
[1:22:52] every day of the month you read it
[1:22:54] ponder it you'll find your life you'll
[1:22:57] find your life changing for the good I
[1:23:00] mean God condenses as truths does he not
[1:23:03] so you know there's many power even just
[1:23:05] in a in one one verse is many powerful
[1:23:08] things so let's go to proverbs 24 and 30
[1:23:11] now I'm still talking about Philemon if
[1:23:13] you won't know where I'm going we
[1:23:14] haven't gone Horticultural you know only
[1:23:17] but proverbs 24 and 30 I went by the
[1:23:21] field of the slothful I mean say I mean
[1:23:24] when you are there and by the vineyard
[1:23:27] of a man void of understanding see
[1:23:29] someone who's lazy
[1:23:30] someone who doesn't have understanding
[1:23:32] and lo it was all grown over with thorns
[1:23:35] and nettles had covered the face thereof
[1:23:37] and the Stonewall drove was broken down
[1:23:39] then I saw and I considered it well and
[1:23:42] looked upon it and received instruction
[1:23:44] so we have just read in the Song of
[1:23:48] Solomon that we are a garden and to me
[1:23:51] in this proverb that the state of this
[1:23:54] man's vineyard is a manifestation of the
[1:23:56] state of his soul
[1:23:57] see he's slothful he has no
[1:24:00] understanding and because he is he has
[1:24:02] this nature amen his garden as just
[1:24:06] thorns and needles and his and and and
[1:24:08] the walls broken down so what's growing
[1:24:11] in him just grows
[1:24:13] there's no cultivation there's no
[1:24:15] planting the rites Eden amen and then
[1:24:18] the wall is broken down now we read and
[1:24:20] I'm just going to jump to this one no
[1:24:23] maybe I'll just actually follow my notes
[1:24:24] for once you know you know mark 14 Jesus
[1:24:28] gives the parable of the sower and he
[1:24:31] says that they that the seed falls among
[1:24:33] thorns as those that hear the word and
[1:24:37] the cares of this world and the
[1:24:40] deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of
[1:24:42] other things entering in they choke the
[1:24:44] word and it becometh unfruitful so the
[1:24:47] word is sown it's received
[1:24:49] but the cares of life you know
[1:24:51] deceitfulness of riches the lust of
[1:24:53] other things then they enter in and we'd
[1:24:56] always grow quicker than the original
[1:24:57] thing you want right so so this person
[1:25:00] allows other things to be sown into
[1:25:02] their life and because they actually are
[1:25:04] trying to jump on to those things the
[1:25:06] Word of God cannot grow it's choked out
[1:25:09] it doesn't it doesn't come to maturity
[1:25:11] it doesn't produce what it's meant to
[1:25:12] produce but the thorns of this life
[1:25:15] choke it out this is someone void of
[1:25:18] understanding what because what happens
[1:25:21] is they don't have understanding that
[1:25:23] this this is mildly official if it's
[1:25:26] receiving to a heart of faith but the
[1:25:28] devil doesn't want the word to produce
[1:25:30] what it says it will produce you know
[1:25:32] God is not an instant God right it's
[1:25:35] here you know he says like in the book
[1:25:37] of Ephesians he says that that we we
[1:25:40] begin as babies tossed to and fro right
[1:25:42] but then we should grow to maturity
[1:25:44] to the image of the Son of Man right so
[1:25:47] we are all spiritually when we're
[1:25:49] birthed into the kingdom doesn't matter
[1:25:50] what age that maybe we're babies but God
[1:25:53] wants us to grow and he wants his word
[1:25:55] to grow in us amen sir but if we let the
[1:25:59] deceitfulness of riches lusts of other
[1:26:01] things entering it chokes the word why
[1:26:04] do you think we have so many
[1:26:05] distractions in this day because the
[1:26:07] devil doesn't want the bride to come to
[1:26:09] her maturity he wants to sow his thorns
[1:26:11] and his needles and as and as you know
[1:26:13] he wants his crowd our mind we're so
[1:26:16] many things that the word because the
[1:26:18] word has to enter into the mind then it
[1:26:20] goes down to the heart brother Aaron
[1:26:21] says and greatest battle ever fought so
[1:26:23] if our mind is fought with everything
[1:26:24] else but the word how can it produce
[1:26:26] itself you following me I mean you say
[1:26:30] well this is a lot of work but if you've
[1:26:32] got the vision of what it will produce
[1:26:33] you'll say Lord I want your word to
[1:26:35] manifest in me I mean so so we don't
[1:26:38] want this so and that's what happens
[1:26:40] many times we want an instant fix but
[1:26:43] God gives us a seed like Israel cried
[1:26:45] out for a deliverer he gave him a baby
[1:26:47] right it was the Messiah but it had to
[1:26:51] grow become fully mature and then he
[1:26:53] manifested his Messiahship a menace like
[1:26:55] the word the word is a seed but it's got
[1:26:57] to grow I mean but then you can be so
[1:27:00] caught up in a service you can walk out
[1:27:02] the doors be consumed by this world and
[1:27:04] what's going on what's happening the
[1:27:05] world comes in and chokes I mean what
[1:27:07] what's just been so on amen that's why
[1:27:11] whatever things are good true and just
[1:27:12] and lovely and honest think on those
[1:27:14] things that's the Word of God you should
[1:27:16] think on those things you say well you
[1:27:18] too heavenly minded you'll be no earthly
[1:27:19] good know if you're too heavenly minded
[1:27:21] you will be earthly good I mean because
[1:27:23] you'll be official for the kingdom of
[1:27:25] God hallelujah you know brother Billy
[1:27:29] Paul said to his daddy said daddy all
[1:27:30] you think about is God you know like
[1:27:33] it's a bad thing it's not necessarily
[1:27:35] bad sure we've got to have jobs we've
[1:27:36] got to look after our family look after
[1:27:38] natural things but they shouldn't
[1:27:39] consume us right the whole thrust of our
[1:27:42] life should be the word should be living
[1:27:44] for him because he's worth it
[1:27:46] amen now this this and then he also saw
[1:27:51] that though the wall that was the stone
[1:27:55] wall there all was broken down
[1:27:58] we know wall as a as a barrier it's a
[1:28:00] protection if you know if you build a
[1:28:03] wall around something you your wanting
[1:28:05] to protect it right it says in Proverbs
[1:28:08] 25 28 he that hath no rule over his own
[1:28:11] spirit as like a city that is broken
[1:28:13] down
[1:28:14] and without walls so saying that they
[1:28:16] that have no you know them that have no
[1:28:19] control no dominion over their own
[1:28:21] spirit their emotions their affections
[1:28:23] conscious reasoning imagination you know
[1:28:25] all those things they have no control
[1:28:26] over that they're like a city that has
[1:28:28] broken down without walls a city that's
[1:28:30] broken down and without walls in him he
[1:28:32] just comes in and the enemy ghost
[1:28:34] there's no defense nothing to withstand
[1:28:36] it he just comes and he goes he does
[1:28:38] what he wants amen and this is someone
[1:28:41] void of understanding a slothful man
[1:28:42] that has not built a wall he following
[1:28:46] me maybe yeah
[1:28:48] so so those so the Spirit is the
[1:28:51] emotional realm they have no control
[1:28:53] over it they see something that that you
[1:28:56] know or or something bad happens to them
[1:28:58] someone offends them the resentment the
[1:29:00] unforgiveness they hold because they
[1:29:02] feel hurt and annoyed just runs rampant
[1:29:04] in their lives instead of the Word of
[1:29:06] God being the wall the defense that they
[1:29:09] that their emotions are subject to and
[1:29:11] that take control of it okay men the
[1:29:15] devil comes in resentment and you know
[1:29:17] and that just people just fester on that
[1:29:19] thing and it just snowballs and it just
[1:29:21] consumes their whole life and they get
[1:29:23] angry at other people you know that have
[1:29:25] just been nice and because someone did
[1:29:26] something 20 years ago what's happening
[1:29:28] there's no wall there's no debt there's
[1:29:30] no control over the spirit amen
[1:29:34] this world is hyped towards the senses
[1:29:37] this whole world is so engineered to to
[1:29:39] just lift the senses up we don't want to
[1:29:43] be a nun have a nun wall spirit well
[1:29:46] then how do you put a wall around that
[1:29:48] wall is the Word of God you can't stop
[1:29:50] the you can't stop life affecting you
[1:29:53] life happens the same things that
[1:29:55] happened to people in the world happened
[1:29:56] to us we can't stop it but you can stop
[1:29:59] how it controls you I mean you can
[1:30:02] actually you can actually put a wall
[1:30:04] around your spirit that when the enemy
[1:30:06] comes in just say if someone offends you
[1:30:08] something happens instead of dwelling on
[1:30:10] that thing of becoming a massive
[1:30:12] you can take that person in prayer into
[1:30:14] the presence of God amen and you can
[1:30:16] truly forgive them and to truly forgive
[1:30:18] means you actually forfeit the right to
[1:30:20] hold it against them in the future right
[1:30:22] and then you can actually come into the
[1:30:24] presence of God with that person in
[1:30:26] prayer and you will feel sorry for that
[1:30:28] person that did it to you what's that
[1:30:30] that's a wall
[1:30:32] hallelujah amen but you got to see the
[1:30:36] you got to see the value of it someone
[1:30:40] void of understanding doesn't see they
[1:30:41] just are run by their emotions unwalled
[1:30:44] spirit nothing's fruitful in their lives
[1:30:46] person void of understanding well I
[1:30:50] believe I'm not looking at those kind of
[1:30:51] people Amen see different gifts now I
[1:30:59] wrote this in my notes and this is
[1:31:00] probably the most obvious you know I say
[1:31:02] sometimes I've kept in obvious strikes
[1:31:04] again but you know we all have
[1:31:06] personalities yes we do we're not robots
[1:31:10] every personality now God when he saves
[1:31:13] us he doesn't wipe our personality right
[1:31:16] he can take the bad parts of it sure
[1:31:17] that you know but he will we're still us
[1:31:21] hallelujah and we'll still be us in
[1:31:24] eternity hallelujah
[1:31:26] so how he made me this is how I'm gonna
[1:31:28] be right he will refine me show you mold
[1:31:30] me but my personality will be my
[1:31:32] personality now with that personality
[1:31:35] comes a comes a certain gifting now I'll
[1:31:40] just take three that are very very very
[1:31:42] obvious you take someone who's a
[1:31:45] perceiver it's not someone who's
[1:31:47] critical someone who's a perceiver
[1:31:48] someone who's a mercy and someone who's
[1:31:50] a teacher those are those are gifts that
[1:31:53] we are born with right even even
[1:31:56] unconverted people like that and there's
[1:31:58] and there's more gifts than that but
[1:31:59] right but the thing is now if that if
[1:32:02] that if that gift is surrendered to God
[1:32:04] then God can use it for the body but if
[1:32:07] it's can but in that it's always like
[1:32:09] you know there's always two sides to
[1:32:11] everything there can be the good use of
[1:32:13] it and the bad yous right but it depends
[1:32:16] if it's walled now the good will be used
[1:32:19] and only the good but if there's but if
[1:32:21] the walls broken down the devil just
[1:32:22] comes in what happens he'll use the bad
[1:32:24] side of the gift
[1:32:25] you take a perceiver for example they
[1:32:27] will see something going on in someone's
[1:32:29] life and they're not looking for it as I
[1:32:31] said it's not being critical
[1:32:32] being a perceiver is not being critical
[1:32:34] that's been critical but a perceiver
[1:32:35] will see something that others will not
[1:32:37] see and if that gift is actually
[1:32:39] surrendered to God they will wait in
[1:32:41] prayer until they have the answer for
[1:32:43] that situation but if their can although
[1:32:45] just say this is wrong this is wrong
[1:32:46] this is wrong and they'll just basically
[1:32:48] destroy the people without helping them
[1:32:50] that's the wrong side of the gift the
[1:32:52] right side is waiting in prayer god
[1:32:53] wiser same thing with the mercy and
[1:32:55] mercy gift is a very powerful gift right
[1:32:58] people who can really enter into burdens
[1:33:00] and pray and help help one another but
[1:33:02] then that mercy gift can be used against
[1:33:04] the person what's happened to my pet
[1:33:11] brother Browne speaks to the interview
[1:33:13] with sister Bruce private interview I
[1:33:16] believe it's now called and brother
[1:33:19] sister Bruce is wondering she's having a
[1:33:24] private interview because she's
[1:33:25] wondering when she received the Holy
[1:33:27] Ghost because she says it's not a moment
[1:33:29] in her experience we say this is when
[1:33:31] she received it so she's wanting Lee so
[1:33:34] so she's having a private interview with
[1:33:35] brother Branham believing that the gift
[1:33:38] in his life will go back in her life and
[1:33:40] reveal this is where you received it now
[1:33:44] so so so brother brain speaking says now
[1:33:47] how could that spirit just leave
[1:33:49] something of the Holy Ghost when you get
[1:33:50] sick you get weary and you're a nervous
[1:33:52] type person and you get things on your
[1:33:55] mind see little bitty things that it
[1:33:56] just keeps building up both ways you'll
[1:33:59] get somebody on your heart and you want
[1:34:01] to pray for them you get up and pray for
[1:34:03] it and you just can't rest till you get
[1:34:05] that person prayed for that's you then
[1:34:07] you take the other side Satan maybe
[1:34:10] might present something that see out
[1:34:12] this way see your nature and God works
[1:34:15] and Satan works then when Satan tries to
[1:34:18] make you believe that you are not see
[1:34:20] you keep building this and maybe this
[1:34:22] and this see don't look at yourself
[1:34:24] sister Bruce remember so he says your
[1:34:27] nature your mercy you get burden you
[1:34:28] pray but who the devil use it against
[1:34:30] you and then so she's starting to
[1:34:32] question now do I have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:33] cuz the devil is using her own nature
[1:34:35] against her who's been there
[1:34:39] he says I'm fixing to pray for you I'm
[1:34:42] not worthy of that I think well what I
[1:34:44] do what would I do if Jesus was sitting
[1:34:47] here and what would he do if he was
[1:34:49] sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you
[1:34:51] in with his great faith see you'd get
[1:34:52] well well I think well I'm a sinner I'm
[1:34:54] not him but I come to represent him but
[1:34:57] remember me being a sinner in before God
[1:34:59] I'm not a sinner neither of you we've
[1:35:01] got a blood sacrifice laying there God
[1:35:03] don't even see us he hears our voice but
[1:35:05] he sees the blood of Christ that's at
[1:35:07] scene he sees the blood of his own son
[1:35:09] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:35:11] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:35:14] so therefore we're sinners no more we
[1:35:16] are Christian I believe you to be a
[1:35:18] genuine Christian woman
[1:35:19] I remember the thing with sister Bruce
[1:35:22] is I make so many mistakes and I fail so
[1:35:24] many times and brother Graham says
[1:35:25] that's why Christ had to die so that you
[1:35:28] with your mistakes wouldn't be allotted
[1:35:29] to you see he took your mistakes your
[1:35:32] desire in your heart is to serve Him
[1:35:34] sister Bruce is yes all right that's
[1:35:37] what He died for so you could serve him
[1:35:39] now not your your mistakes and not look
[1:35:42] not lot at you see he is your
[1:35:44] propitiation see he is your sin offering
[1:35:47] your sins are not known you're not a
[1:35:49] sinner before God Christ took your sins
[1:35:52] and became you because your desire is to
[1:35:55] serve Him hallelujah now now brother I
[1:36:01] see is in Christ is revealed in his own
[1:36:03] word he says I was just talking to a
[1:36:05] young minister and his wife in the room
[1:36:07] just a few minutes ago and both him and
[1:36:09] nervous just like the rest of the world
[1:36:11] rest of human beings on earth I said
[1:36:13] remember Satan's got a punch coming at
[1:36:15] you don't care who you were he's got a
[1:36:18] right for that one punch which would you
[1:36:20] rather be that punch be blind or be
[1:36:22] arthritic sitting in a chair or be
[1:36:24] nervous see he's got somewhere he can
[1:36:27] punch you he's got a right to that open
[1:36:29] place now that's the spot you've got to
[1:36:31] keep covered all the time amen and to
[1:36:34] see this nervous age that we're living
[1:36:36] in so there's this place in us we have
[1:36:39] to keep covered by prayer keep it
[1:36:41] surrendered I mean you keep hitting
[1:36:43] under the shadows of the wings of your
[1:36:45] mighty by prayers keep your life sarena
[1:36:47] don't take it back up again right holy
[1:36:49] and the devil can't get you there
[1:36:52] this is in the book of Ephesians that
[1:36:55] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:36:56] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:36:58] the hope of his calling and what the
[1:36:59] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:37:00] in the Saints hallelujah so our our eyes
[1:37:04] shouldn't be dull we shouldn't be void
[1:37:05] of understanding which we're people be
[1:37:07] of we should be a people of
[1:37:09] understanding lujah amen those who have
[1:37:14] understanding know the power and the
[1:37:15] ability of the word to wash them
[1:37:17] Allu you amen you say you know many
[1:37:21] times before we come to church we're
[1:37:22] troubled we're upset things are going on
[1:37:25] you're our mind we're all you know maybe
[1:37:27] and have ought against people we're all
[1:37:28] grumpy whatever more but then after
[1:37:30] service what you feel like you feel
[1:37:32] happy you feel rejoiced you know yeah
[1:37:34] you know you feel good why cause the
[1:37:36] word has wash that off you and when the
[1:37:38] word has cleanse you the word has
[1:37:39] changed you Amy because the devil tries
[1:37:41] to attach himself to us during the week
[1:37:43] but then the word comes and washes it
[1:37:45] away takes it away Amy I don't know how
[1:37:47] many devils would've been cast out just
[1:37:49] from the preaching of the word
[1:37:50] I mean troubles and you know being all
[1:37:51] caught up and things in you leave the
[1:37:53] service here I feel so good why cause
[1:37:55] the waters washed you I mean to those
[1:37:57] who have understanding know the parent
[1:37:59] ability of the word to wash them
[1:38:01] hallelujah
[1:38:02] Amy because we are cleansed but with the
[1:38:06] washing of the water of the word
[1:38:07] hallelujah now we read it you know so I
[1:38:12] said about you know we got to cultivate
[1:38:14] spiritual desires a spiritual appetite
[1:38:17] we were to develop it I mean we're going
[1:38:19] to watch what grows an hour
[1:38:21] yes I think it's like brother Brahim
[1:38:22] said it's like a bird you know who
[1:38:25] starts to build a nest you know it's
[1:38:28] like it's like the devil plants a
[1:38:29] thought in your mind you can't stop the
[1:38:31] bird flying overhead but you can stop a
[1:38:34] building the nest but it depends up to
[1:38:37] you what are you going to just dwell on
[1:38:38] the negative brother Bram he would he
[1:38:40] would come to a place where he would
[1:38:42] rededicate himself leaning over the
[1:38:44] Ottoman or whatever it was in his room
[1:38:46] with his wife he would pray it's a we we
[1:38:48] surrender every negative thought Amen
[1:38:52] how about you and I I think from time
[1:38:54] dog when we read you to Kate our lives
[1:38:55] we say Lord I surrender everything I'm
[1:38:57] not just myself every negative thought
[1:38:59] every ought every everything that would
[1:39:01] drain my faith disable my faith Lord I
[1:39:03] give it to you
[1:39:05] hallelujah now as as brother James did a
[1:39:08] few wins days ago from the scripture and
[1:39:10] Galatians for in Christ Jesus neither
[1:39:12] circumcision availeth anything nor
[1:39:14] uncircumcision but faith which worketh
[1:39:16] by love I mean so if your faith faith
[1:39:19] worketh by love he said Lord I want to
[1:39:22] be your garden I mean you'll see it's
[1:39:25] worth you know I'm not talking about
[1:39:28] salvation this year this morning I'm
[1:39:29] talking about being having a fictional
[1:39:31] faith that our walk will be effectual
[1:39:33] and then when the Lord comes by your way
[1:39:35] he sees a perfect garden no weeds the
[1:39:38] walls are high holy the angels there I'm
[1:39:41] in the Holy Ghost is there I mean
[1:39:43] everything's been cultivated just right
[1:39:45] the tree of life is blooming
[1:39:46] hallelujah says that person has
[1:39:49] understanding they're not slothful
[1:39:50] they're diligent amen because they love
[1:39:52] me faith worketh by love they put their
[1:39:54] faith into action hallelujah look at
[1:39:58] what they are now many times we allow
[1:40:03] the devil to rob us of so much victory
[1:40:06] and many times it's not even the devil
[1:40:09] that robs us it's our own selves but yet
[1:40:13] we will blame the devil and since it's
[1:40:15] not him we will remain in that cycle
[1:40:18] because you got to get to the root cause
[1:40:20] of it you know the devil the first the
[1:40:22] devil this and if the devil would tell
[1:40:23] the truth they say it wasn't me I'm over
[1:40:25] here doing this I wasn't there but it's
[1:40:28] actually our own selves with we give the
[1:40:30] devil too much credit right so many
[1:40:34] times it's our own selves that get us
[1:40:37] into a cycle of defeat it's our own
[1:40:39] selves what you know you read through
[1:40:43] the book of Judges you just go through
[1:40:44] the Old Testament what caused and and
[1:40:48] I've just taken the first few from the
[1:40:49] book of Judges what caused Israel to
[1:40:52] fall into being under the bondage of
[1:40:54] their neighbors I read a few judges to
[1:40:57] an eleven and the children of Israel did
[1:40:59] evil in the sight of the Lord and served
[1:41:00] Balaam judges three and seven and the
[1:41:03] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[1:41:04] of the Lord and forget the Lord their
[1:41:05] God and serve Balaam in the Groves
[1:41:07] judges three and twelve and the children
[1:41:09] of Israel did evil again on the side of
[1:41:11] the Lord judges four and one and the
[1:41:13] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[1:41:15] of the Lord judges six and one and the
[1:41:18] children of is
[1:41:18] well did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:41:20] and you can just keep going down so it
[1:41:22] doesn't say and the enemy came against
[1:41:24] them and they're in bondage no it
[1:41:25] started by the children of Israel doing
[1:41:28] evil in the sight of the Lord why
[1:41:30] because they had a fallen nature the
[1:41:31] blood of bulls and goats could not
[1:41:33] change that
[1:41:33] I mean souls their ownselves have
[1:41:35] brought them into bondage amen
[1:41:39] and it should be the same thing with you
[1:41:42] and I the enemy can't know our own self
[1:41:45] you know we become have you ever heard
[1:41:49] of the saying how people are just like a
[1:41:50] wrecking ball in their own lives they
[1:41:53] actually destroy everything they're the
[1:41:55] wrecking ball it's not the devil as
[1:41:56] their own selves they wreck their
[1:41:58] families they wreck their relationships
[1:41:59] they wreck their lives as their own
[1:42:00] selves as their carnal nature that
[1:42:02] actually wrecks everything who seen a
[1:42:05] wrecking ball swings into a building but
[1:42:08] chunks come out swingers again just
[1:42:09] smashes it down that's our own he said I
[1:42:14] love the devil's swinging that and he
[1:42:16] says no you're you're actually on the
[1:42:17] end of that you're swinging it yourself
[1:42:20] what's that now their faith is not
[1:42:23] effectual it wasn't there see Israel it
[1:42:27] wasn't the enemy's fault it was their
[1:42:29] own and they brought on the bondage of
[1:42:31] the enemy upon their selves and it's
[1:42:35] like ones that are like a wrecking ball
[1:42:37] in their own lives their faith isn't
[1:42:40] effectual because of themselves people
[1:42:43] will let their past disable their faith
[1:42:45] they will let anger disable their faith
[1:42:48] they will let unforgiveness disable
[1:42:51] their faith there's what happens people
[1:42:53] you know how was job's trial finally
[1:42:56] turned you read the end of Jobe God
[1:42:59] tells his friends get job to pray for
[1:43:01] you and it says Joe prayed for his
[1:43:03] friends then God turned his captivity
[1:43:05] when he prayed he forgave his friends I
[1:43:08] mean so his trial was ended by him
[1:43:11] praying forgiveness for his friends
[1:43:13] because his friends were lying to him
[1:43:14] about who God really was they were lying
[1:43:17] to him I think God came down said no I'm
[1:43:19] not what these these people say I am
[1:43:21] right and so his forgiveness turned his
[1:43:24] captivity but people hold unforgiveness
[1:43:27] because of reasoning and so many things
[1:43:29] are out of reasoning people reason
[1:43:31] things out in their own mind will they
[1:43:32] do
[1:43:32] tonight I have a right to be like this
[1:43:34] and they should forgive me here and all
[1:43:35] the people reason about it's not about
[1:43:37] reasoning right we don't want a reason
[1:43:40] to to to hold on to something they leave
[1:43:44] their past hold them back they let pride
[1:43:46] disable their faith God resists the
[1:43:48] proud trying to be the biggest and best
[1:43:53] bestest if that's a word disables their
[1:43:55] faith people let fear disable their
[1:43:58] faith people being worried about what
[1:44:02] others think about them disables their
[1:44:04] faith people not giving up pity things
[1:44:07] disables their faith amen you say well
[1:44:11] that's not a pity thing maybe - it's big
[1:44:14] but in God's economy it's pity God wants
[1:44:17] to give you greater than what you have
[1:44:18] even now like the rich young ruler he
[1:44:20] was rich but he had nothing all he had
[1:44:22] to do was sell all he had take up his
[1:44:24] cross and follow the Lord and he would
[1:44:26] have had far greater riches than what he
[1:44:28] had in the bank but he wasn't willing to
[1:44:31] do it people get all tense and stressed
[1:44:36] and worried their minds are caught up in
[1:44:38] things that don't even matter it
[1:44:40] disables their faith he say but I'm
[1:44:42] going through a big thing and the grand
[1:44:45] scheme of things doesn't really matter
[1:44:47] right season James 1 and 22 but be doers
[1:44:54] of the word and not hearers only
[1:44:55] deceiving your own selves for if any be
[1:44:58] hear of the word and not a doer he is
[1:45:00] like unto a man beholding his nature his
[1:45:02] natural face in a glass for he beholdeth
[1:45:05] himself and goeth way and straightway
[1:45:07] forgetteth what manner of man he was
[1:45:09] those are just hearers they hear the
[1:45:11] word hallelujah that's wonderful glory
[1:45:12] then they go away forget about it and
[1:45:14] they forget who their identity really is
[1:45:16] right because but he but whosoever but
[1:45:20] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[1:45:23] of Liberty and continueth therein he
[1:45:27] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[1:45:29] of the law of the work this man shall be
[1:45:32] blessed in his deed so he didn't look us
[1:45:35] into the perfect law of Liberty and
[1:45:37] continues in it Jesus said a few if you
[1:45:41] continue in my word then you are my
[1:45:43] disciples indeed so you've got to
[1:45:45] continue in
[1:45:46] the word don't just start and say well
[1:45:47] that was nice God seeing a prophet Here
[1:45:49] I am
[1:45:49] you gotta continue in the word right you
[1:45:52] got a you know sure you got to repent be
[1:45:54] baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:55] receive the Holy Ghost but you got to
[1:45:57] continue on from that you gonna continue
[1:45:59] in the word you can't just get derailed
[1:46:01] and do what you want to do you gotta
[1:46:02] continue amen are you sure you know you
[1:46:05] receive the Holy Ghost you have
[1:46:07] salvation I mean but you want your face
[1:46:08] to be a fiction right you want to grow
[1:46:11] into the statue of the perfect man come
[1:46:13] to your adoption amen so that's it it's
[1:46:18] so similar look into the law of perfect
[1:46:20] law of Liberty and continue there and
[1:46:22] see people identity is so important in
[1:46:28] this day everyone is looking for
[1:46:30] identity and that's what happens people
[1:46:33] look at the word and they can see their
[1:46:36] identities in the word do they walk away
[1:46:38] and they forget who they who who they
[1:46:40] really are
[1:46:41] forgets what manner of man he was just
[1:46:43] like looking in a glass this this is a
[1:46:45] mirror there's a glass and when we look
[1:46:47] into this we should be able to see this
[1:46:49] is me this is my identity this is where
[1:46:51] I belong not in the country not in a
[1:46:53] group not in a movement but this I mean
[1:46:55] this is my identification I'll leave but
[1:46:58] I seem that stay and keep beholding it
[1:47:01] hallelujah when you look into the word
[1:47:05] you're seeing who you really are
[1:47:07] I trust identity is so important it's
[1:47:10] because the bride is being identified by
[1:47:12] the manifested word but why live below
[1:47:16] your privilege trying to be identified
[1:47:18] in something else see and identity in
[1:47:23] the world is not going to give you
[1:47:24] overcoming power it's not going to give
[1:47:26] you peace there parsall understand it's
[1:47:28] not going to give you joy hell is not
[1:47:30] going to give you victory and that's
[1:47:33] what happened
[1:47:33] Israel forgot the Lord there I've got
[1:47:35] identified with the gods of other
[1:47:37] nations they didn't have victory they
[1:47:39] didn't they weren't living in peace
[1:47:41] they're under under the control of other
[1:47:43] people it's the same thing today
[1:47:46] what does what the movies do they
[1:47:48] predict an identity they preach a sermon
[1:47:51] you know I don't have it or maybe I do I
[1:47:54] read an article I
[1:47:59] an article about the it was about the
[1:48:02] Klu Klux Klan and the klu klux Center
[1:48:06] and have it right on me but by 1870 it
[1:48:08] was virtually it was branded a terrorist
[1:48:11] organization has basically did in the
[1:48:13] water but then in the 1920s a man made a
[1:48:17] film about the KKK and it was a it was
[1:48:20] romanticizing what they stood for and
[1:48:23] that actually produced a revival of the
[1:48:25] movement because his people they don't
[1:48:27] know who they are and then they see this
[1:48:30] film about the KKK and then all the
[1:48:33] white people say this is my identity and
[1:48:34] it produces a revival of the movement
[1:48:36] because people looking for an identity
[1:48:39] and that's why things are put in front
[1:48:40] of us in this day this is you this is
[1:48:42] you
[1:48:43] you'll be the gamer you can be the
[1:48:44] sportsman you can be the whatever this
[1:48:46] is you and people all this is yes and
[1:48:49] they look for they try and grab your who
[1:48:51] they really think they are but meet I
[1:48:53] still become that and they're not that
[1:48:54] there's no peace and becoming that
[1:48:56] hallelujah but then the Lord puts us in
[1:48:58] front of us amen more than a movie more
[1:49:03] than romanticizing something it's a
[1:49:05] reality and God is trying to tell you
[1:49:07] who you really are
[1:49:08] he doesn't want you he yeah he's trying
[1:49:10] to tell you you don't belong out there
[1:49:12] that's why you don't fit in I mean you
[1:49:14] you know many times at school there's
[1:49:15] peer pressure to to to fit into the
[1:49:18] group but then when you fit into the
[1:49:19] group you don't fit in I mean I've been
[1:49:21] there I know tried to be with the
[1:49:24] sportsman tried to be with the Nerds I
[1:49:25] was just in between somewhere floating
[1:49:27] around I didn't know where I was but
[1:49:29] then one day I heard a voice and I found
[1:49:32] out where I really belong wasn't the
[1:49:34] Word of God hallelujah
[1:49:37] you got to know where you are who's our
[1:49:41] identity he is our identity amen and and
[1:49:48] that's what's happened today the devil
[1:49:50] works on people you know why is he great
[1:49:52] movements in this world because people
[1:49:55] don't know where they belong and the
[1:49:57] devil then puts for an identity and
[1:49:59] actually tells them this is what's wrong
[1:50:01] in the world they rally behind that they
[1:50:02] become something that they shouldn't be
[1:50:05] you take white people for example you
[1:50:08] know this is great you know people say
[1:50:10] oh you know Europe's going to be
[1:50:12] by other nations and you know you've got
[1:50:14] to stand up and stand for your rights
[1:50:16] and all these things and you know what
[1:50:18] happens people rarely about their cuz I
[1:50:19] don't know who they are because their
[1:50:21] cuz the national identity is changing
[1:50:23] they don't know how they fit in that
[1:50:24] national identity
[1:50:25] it's not about fitting in national
[1:50:26] identity is about fitting in this I mean
[1:50:29] if people really recognize know I'm a
[1:50:30] son of God I'm a daughter of God doesn't
[1:50:32] matter what the nation does around them
[1:50:34] they'll remain the same hallelujah
[1:50:37] but the devil plays on people's
[1:50:40] insecurities where do I belong in
[1:50:41] society I don't know and he comes like
[1:50:43] I'll tell you right we don't want to be
[1:50:48] that way
[1:50:49] let me tell you something this is from
[1:50:52] thirst let me tell you something when
[1:50:55] you're worshiping God in the spirit and
[1:50:56] truth and when it becomes a custom for
[1:50:59] you to do it don't you think you ought
[1:51:01] to do it because you think if you don't
[1:51:03] shout or jump up and down dance with the
[1:51:05] music or your neighbors doing it to
[1:51:07] think your back slit you're drinking
[1:51:08] from a stagnated stream until it fills
[1:51:12] every fiber until the Holy Spirit itself
[1:51:15] is bubbling in you I don't care where
[1:51:17] the music's playing or whether it's
[1:51:18] playing nearer my God to thee or
[1:51:20] whatever it is the Holy Spirit is still
[1:51:22] ringing the glory bells in your heart
[1:51:23] that satisfies that's God satisfying
[1:51:26] portion anything else than that you're
[1:51:28] done hallelujah we want our faith to be
[1:51:33] effectual amen brother BAM would
[1:51:36] dramatize you know when he goes hunting
[1:51:38] and he sees a he sees a bubbling stream
[1:51:43] and he says you know if the stream could
[1:51:46] talk I'd say stream why you bubbling why
[1:51:48] are you bubbling this way is it because
[1:51:50] the deer comes longer drink serve you
[1:51:51] know it's not because that cuz of the
[1:51:53] beer or some of the animal or is it
[1:51:54] because I drink from you know stop that
[1:51:56] it's not me bubbling something's pushing
[1:51:57] behind me makes me bubble holy this
[1:52:00] stream was effectual there's a force in
[1:52:02] it pushing out the water hallelujah
[1:52:05] that's the same thing with you and I if
[1:52:06] the word is the word is in us if he if
[1:52:10] he himself God Himself is in you the
[1:52:12] word is in you but it's got to push out
[1:52:14] right if you're fully surrender to them
[1:52:16] you have no or you have your peace with
[1:52:18] everyone you're not worried about you
[1:52:19] know not no unforgiveness no bitterness
[1:52:22] no resentment no pride then God can
[1:52:25] manifest
[1:52:26] himself through you hallelujah it's like
[1:52:28] Ezreal you know they were seven days
[1:52:30] they were going to go fight somebody
[1:52:32] more ever whoever it was and and they
[1:52:34] had no water they they went seven days
[1:52:36] and they found out we have no water and
[1:52:38] they even say if you go read the story
[1:52:41] God brought us out here to die
[1:52:42] no God didn't bring them anywhere they
[1:52:46] themselves brought them into the desert
[1:52:47] by their own good intentions let's go
[1:52:49] take back our land or whatever it is and
[1:52:51] then so they get the Prophet the Prophet
[1:52:52] comes along thus saith the Lord make the
[1:52:55] valley full of ditches right you won't
[1:52:58] see rain you won't hear anything but but
[1:53:00] waters going to fill the place make the
[1:53:02] valley full of ditches and so it was up
[1:53:04] to them because there was a smitten rock
[1:53:06] and that desert it was there it was
[1:53:09] there where they were but it had to be
[1:53:11] uncovered and although all that all the
[1:53:13] dirt or the sand all the bitterness or
[1:53:16] the resentment all the malice or the
[1:53:18] strife or the envy all the slothfulness
[1:53:20] or the laziness or the indifference a
[1:53:22] man had to be dug away all worrying
[1:53:26] about what people say and we are caring
[1:53:28] about stuff yo there had to be all dug
[1:53:30] away Pylea for that water to stop
[1:53:33] bubbling forth again hallelujah and they
[1:53:35] dug and then the question was how much
[1:53:37] water do you want amen they do they just
[1:53:40] want to cover a little bit of the rock
[1:53:42] once you hit the rock keep digging I
[1:53:44] haven't keep thinking I don't just want
[1:53:46] a little drop drop drop job that's not
[1:53:49] because the waters is there's a big
[1:53:51] gusher eternal gusher it can't run dry
[1:53:53] it's impossible for God to ever run dry
[1:53:55] run out of goodness I'm it's I just want
[1:53:58] to drop I want to be flooded I want to
[1:54:00] be swimming holy I want to be stuck I
[1:54:03] don't know where the land is that's how
[1:54:04] much water I have hallelujah and that
[1:54:08] what you want God rivers of living water
[1:54:10] would flow forth there's no what you
[1:54:13] want amen
[1:54:18] that's what we need to do so as as the
[1:54:23] Apostle Paul said to Philemon that the
[1:54:26] communication of thy faith will become
[1:54:28] effectual he wants our faith to be
[1:54:31] official by the acknowledging of every
[1:54:34] good thing which is in thee by Christ
[1:54:35] Jesus see if you if you keep looking at
[1:54:39] yourself
[1:54:40] you want this we know there's nothing in
[1:54:42] ourselves there's no good thing right
[1:54:44] but in him if he's in us there's all
[1:54:46] good things in him right be you to
[1:54:48] acknowledge what's in you by Christ I
[1:54:50] mean then then your faith can become
[1:54:53] effectual that's just like you know if
[1:54:56] you know we go to the Old Testament if
[1:54:59] Israel didn't know where their borders
[1:55:01] were in the Promised Land they would
[1:55:02] never have taken the whole country if
[1:55:04] they never knew it was there to take
[1:55:06] they would never have taken it right
[1:55:07] that's the same thing in Christ if we
[1:55:09] don't know the land is there the word is
[1:55:11] here to possess we won't possess it amen
[1:55:14] but then if he's saying that the every
[1:55:15] good thing that you must acknowledge I
[1:55:18] mean every good thing which is in you by
[1:55:20] Christ Jesus that's how your faith will
[1:55:22] become effectual that's because if
[1:55:24] you're really a believer if you say well
[1:55:26] they should be joy their faith will rise
[1:55:28] the occasion you'll possess that joy you
[1:55:30] say well their peace should be in my
[1:55:31] heart
[1:55:31] I mean faith will arise and possess that
[1:55:33] peace how they ever have an overcoming
[1:55:36] fate of a real gumption real like Lord I
[1:55:38] want to I want to possess the land I
[1:55:39] don't be slothful I don't want to be
[1:55:41] lazy I don't want to be ineffectual I
[1:55:43] don't want to be like a God and covered
[1:55:44] in thorns and thistles with a wall
[1:55:45] broken down I don't want the devil to
[1:55:47] come in and just ride me anywhere I want
[1:55:49] anyway once hallelujah if that's in you
[1:55:52] I mean to have that desire faith will
