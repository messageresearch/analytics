[0:35] be,
[0:36] how
[0:38] marvelous,
[0:40] how
[0:42] wonderful is my
[0:45] Savior's love for me.
[0:51] For me it was in the
[0:57] garden. He prayed not my will but
[1:05] thine. He had no tears for
[1:10] whom griefs but sweat drops of love for
[1:17] mine.
[1:19] [Music]
[1:21] How
[1:23] marvelous,
[1:25] how
[1:27] wonderful, and my song shall
[1:32] ever
[1:34] be,
[1:36] how
[1:38] marvelous,
[1:39] how
[1:41] wonderful is my
[1:45] Savior's love for me.
[1:51] When with the ransom in
[1:57] glory his face I at last shall
[2:04] sing. This will be my joy through the
[2:11] ages to sing of his love for me.
[2:19] singing
[2:20] how
[2:22] wonderful,
[2:24] how
[2:26] wonderful and my song shall
[2:31] ever be.
[2:35] How
[2:37] marvelous,
[2:38] how
[2:40] wonderful is my
[2:44] Savior's love for me, how
[2:48] marvelous, singing,
[2:51] how
[2:53] marvelous,
[2:55] how
[2:56] wonderful, and my song shall
[3:01] ever be.
[3:05] How
[3:07] marvelous,
[3:09] how
[3:11] wonderful is my
[3:14] Savior's love for me.
[3:32] [Music]
[3:46] [Music]
[3:51] How deep the father's love for us.
[3:59] hours beyond no
[4:03] [Music]
[4:04] measure that he would give his only
[4:11] son to make a rich his
[4:18] treasure. How great the pain of searing
[4:24] loss.
[4:26] The father turns his face
[4:32] away as wounds which father chosen
[4:39] one bring many sons to glory.
[4:47] Behold the man upon the
[4:52] cross. My ear upon his
[4:59] shoulders. Ashamed thy he the mockers
[5:06] voice. Call out among the scoffers.
[5:14] It was my sin that held him
[5:20] there until it was a
[5:24] [Music]
[5:26] comeless. His dying breath has brought
[5:31] me
[5:33] life. I know that it is finished.
[5:39] [Music]
[5:41] How great the golf that God
[5:46] did to come. Where I lay
[5:53] helpless through tears I see his
[6:00] arrangement. As he declares
[6:04] me blessed.
[6:07] How great the love that sort me
[6:13] out. How
[6:16] infinite his
[6:20] mercy. His blood has cleansed my every
[6:26] heart and claims me as his purchase.
[6:32] [Music]
[6:34] I will not boast in
[6:39] anything. No gifts, no powers, no
[6:46] wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus
[6:53] Christ, his death and resurrection.
[7:00] Why should I gain from his
[7:06] reward? I cannot give an
[7:13] answer, but this I know with all my
[7:19] heart. His words have paid my ransom.
[7:25] [Music]
[7:27] But this I know with all my
[7:33] heart. His words have paid my ransom.
[7:42] [Music]
[7:49] [Music]
[7:59] Were it enough for thy nail
[8:06] scar? Nail scarred
[8:09] hands and
[8:12] thorny bands.
[8:15] Were written not for thy love for
[8:21] me.
[8:24] Unfailing love that chose
[8:30] Calary. Then such a
[8:34] one condemned as
[8:38] I would have no pardon.
[8:44] and I
[8:46] die. But thou, oh
[8:50] Lord, it's up my
[8:54] place. It's up my
[8:58] place. It's up my place.
[9:07] And you bore my sins on your
[9:13] shoulders when you could have had it
[9:18] all. You chose me to be the one that you
[9:23] would die
[9:24] for, the one that you would
[9:28] save, the one that you would carry. from
[9:33] the cradle to the
[9:36] grave. The one that you would care
[9:40] for, the one that you would
[9:44] raise, the one that you would see
[9:47] through every storm and every way. You
[9:52] chose
[9:52] [Music]
[9:58] me. You chose me.
[10:03] [Music]
[10:08] Your head was
[10:11] bound. Your
[10:14] [Music]
[10:15] body mercy called for
[10:18] ransom. You gave an I
[10:22] to your
[10:24] shaking
[10:26] shoulders my sin.
[10:28] [Music]
[10:43] condemned.
[10:46] I would have no
[10:50] part then and I
[10:53] die. But thou, oh Lord,
[11:00] Yes, Lord. You took my
[11:05] place. You took my
[11:08] [Music]
[11:12] place. And you bore my sin on your
[11:19] shoulders.
[11:21] And you could have had it all. You chose
[11:26] me to be the one that you would die
[11:31] for. The one that you would
[11:34] save, the one that you would carry from
[11:39] the cradle to the
[11:42] grave. The one that you would care
[11:46] for, the one that you would raise.
[11:50] the one that you would see through every
[11:54] storm and every wave. You chose
[11:58] [Music]
[12:04] me. You chose
[12:08] me. And you bore
[12:11] me. And you bore my sin on your
[12:17] shoulders.
[12:19] When you could have had it all, you
[12:24] chose me to be the one that you would
[12:28] die
[12:29] for. The one that you would
[12:33] save, the one that you would carry from
[12:38] the cradle to the
[12:41] grave. The one that you would care for.
[12:46] The one that you would
[12:49] say, one that you would see through
[12:52] every storm and every wave. You chose
[12:59] [Music]
[13:03] me. You chose
[13:10] me. You chose me.
[13:19] You chose
[13:20] [Music]
[13:25] me.
[13:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Anyone's got a need on
[13:29] their heart, you just want to raise your
[13:30] hands to the Lord.
[13:33] Oh
[13:35] Lord, what a declaration, Lord, that you
[13:37] would carry us from the cradle to the
[13:40] grave. And Lord, not to die a death, but
[13:44] Lord, to go from this world to the next
[13:46] world, Lord, into your presence, into
[13:49] your glory. And Father, we have received
[13:51] a word in this hour to take us from the
[13:53] cradle to the grave, Lord, and into the
[13:55] next world. Lord, you said in your word,
[13:57] I've come to I go to prepare a place for
[14:01] you. And if I go, I'll come again and
[14:03] receive you unto myself, that where I
[14:05] am, there you'll be also. Amen. Oh Lord,
[14:08] what a journey. Lord, Father, we come to
[14:10] give you praise this night, Lord, to
[14:12] lift you up. We thank you. You're a
[14:13] living God. Lord, you're not just an
[14:15] idea or some doctrine or some mental
[14:17] idea, but you're a living reality, Lord.
[14:20] You've become real to us, Lord. We thank
[14:22] you. You're Lord, not a God of history,
[14:24] but you're the present God. God, you're
[14:26] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[14:28] We thank you. We can be gathered on this
[14:30] night, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We can
[14:32] just be here, oh God. We just pray as we
[14:34] open the pages of your word, Lord. May
[14:36] you speak to us like you never have
[14:38] before through it, Lord. Father, may you
[14:40] just so lift us up into heavenly places,
[14:43] Lord, that we never come down again,
[14:45] Lord. May you grant it for your great
[14:47] glory, Father. Lord, we just commit the
[14:49] service into your hands, Lord. Have
[14:51] liberty among us, Lord, and be with
[14:53] those who couldn't be here tonight,
[14:54] Lord. be their portion and strength. Oh
[14:56] God, Father, those who are streaming in,
[14:58] Lord, may it be like they're on the
[14:59] front row. Yes, Lord. Lord, may you
[15:01] grant it for your glory, Lord. We
[15:03] Father, we just want to pray, Lord, see
[15:05] the many prayer requests that have come
[15:07] through, Lord, over these past few days,
[15:09] Lord, we just think of, Lord, Sister
[15:11] Kay's friends, Lord, and Lord, how the
[15:14] ones in jail, Lord, may you strengthen
[15:15] her in the family, Lord. Father, may
[15:17] they lift their eyes up to you, oh God.
[15:20] You see your daughter Esther has has a
[15:22] burden to witness to her friend at
[15:24] school, Lord. Father, open that door, oh
[15:26] God. Not just to her friend, but her
[15:28] whole family. May they come in, Lord.
[15:29] Meet you, oh God, like we have, Father.
[15:32] May you grant it, Lord. And every other
[15:34] prayer request, Lord. May you meet every
[15:36] need, Lord, for your glory. Lord, you're
[15:38] not an Aaron boy, but we ask these
[15:40] things that you would be exalted and
[15:41] praised, Lord, that we would bring these
[15:43] things and say, "Thank you, Lord." Amen.
[15:45] Lord, just just to just to answer
[15:47] prayer, Lord, Lord, what a privilege it
[15:49] is that we don't just speak into the
[15:51] ceiling, but you hear us, Lord, and you
[15:53] answer back, oh God, according to your
[15:55] will. We thank you for that, Father.
[15:58] Lord, may you just be glorified now in
[16:00] Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen.
[16:04] Amen. Amen. Thank you, musician. Thank
[16:06] you, brother Isaac. Amen. Good evening,
[16:09] everyone.
[16:11] Hallelujah. Amen. It's great to be here.
[16:15] I mean, if you got your Bibles
[16:18] handy, want to just go to Luke chapter
[16:25] 24 and I want to read
[16:28] uh I want to go to so Luke 24 and then
[16:31] we're going to go to John chapter 10 and
[16:34] we got a quite a few scriptures to to
[16:38] try and go through. I want to approach a
[16:40] subject. I was
[16:45] um want to take one
[16:48] word and it's to do with the wedding
[16:51] feast and it's not in the scripture per
[16:56] se but it's part of the feast and it's
[16:58] to be ushered
[16:59] in and um I just want to I want to read
[17:03] a bit of a a a context here just from
[17:05] Luke 24 and then we'll um and then we'll
[17:09] go to Revelations 19 as well and John
[17:10] 10. So, so Luke 24. Now upon the first
[17:13] day of the week, very early in the
[17:15] morning, they came into the sepila,
[17:17] bringing the spices which they had
[17:18] repaired, and certain others with them,
[17:20] and they found the stone rolled away
[17:21] from the sepila. They entered in, they
[17:23] found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
[17:25] And it came to pass, as they were much
[17:27] perplexed there. Behold, two men stood
[17:30] by them in shining garments. And as they
[17:32] were afraid, and bowed down their faces
[17:34] to the earth, they said unto them, "Why
[17:36] seek ye the living among the dead? He is
[17:39] not here, but is risen. Remember how he
[17:41] spake unto you when he was yet in
[17:43] Galilee, saying, "The Son of Man must be
[17:45] delivered into the hands of sinful men,
[17:47] and be crucified, and on the third day
[17:49] rise again." And they remembered his
[17:51] words. And they returned from the
[17:53] sepiler and told these things into the
[17:55] 11 to the
[17:56] rest. And um and let's just jump down to
[18:00] verse verse 13 very quickly. And behold,
[18:04] two of them went that same day to a
[18:06] village called Emmas, which was from
[18:08] Jerusalem, about three score furongs,
[18:10] and they talked together as these things
[18:12] which had happened. And it came to pass
[18:13] that while they communed together, and
[18:16] reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and
[18:18] went with them. But their eyes were
[18:20] Holden that they should not know him.
[18:23] And then we'll go to just John John
[18:25] chapter 10.
[18:33] And we'll read verse one. Verily,
[18:36] verily, I say unto you, he that enterth
[18:38] not by the door unto the sheepfold, but
[18:40] climbth up some other way, the same as a
[18:42] thief and a robber. But he that enterth
[18:44] in by the door is the shepherd of the
[18:46] sheep. To him the porter openeth, and
[18:49] the shepherd hears his voice, and calls
[18:51] his own sheep by name, and leadth them
[18:53] out. And when he puteth forth his own
[18:55] sheep, he goeth before them, and the
[18:57] sheep follow him, for they know his
[18:59] voice. And a stranger will they not
[19:01] follow, and they will flee from him, for
[19:04] they know not the voice of strangers.
[19:08] Amen. Which go to Revelations chapter 19
[19:10] very quickly.
[19:22] And it says this here in in verse 7,
[19:25] Revelations 19, let us be glad and
[19:27] rejoice and give honor to him. For the
[19:30] marriage of the Lamb has come, and his
[19:31] wife has made herself ready, and to her
[19:34] was arrayed that she should be arrayed
[19:35] in fine linen, clean and white. For the
[19:38] fine linen is the righteousness of
[19:39] saints. And he saith unto me, write,
[19:42] blessed are they which are called unto
[19:43] the marriage supper of the Lamb. and he
[19:45] saith unto me, these things are the are
[19:48] the true sayings of God. Amen. May the
[19:51] Lord bless his word. You may be seated.
[19:54] Now, I want to I want to approach a
[19:58] subject and I trust this means a great
[20:00] deal to
[20:01] you. We are being
[20:03] ushered. Okay, we are being ushered into
[20:07] the
[20:07] millennium. I just want to make that
[20:09] statement.
[20:11] Right? You know the word of God and
[20:15] you'll see it in your life. You're in
[20:17] one place and then this word came your
[20:20] way. Jesus came your way and you didn't
[20:22] really and you're like the two on the
[20:24] way to Emmas. You didn't fully even now
[20:27] there's so much of God you know we we we
[20:30] we grasp him, we embrace him and we and
[20:32] we love him but he keeps revealing
[20:34] himself more and more. So we don't know
[20:37] him in his completeness, but as we walk
[20:40] with him, he makes himself more known
[20:42] every day in his word. And so we are
[20:45] much like the two on the way to Emmas
[20:47] where many things have happened in this
[20:50] day. Many scriptures are fulfilled and
[20:52] being fulfilled. You know, we're living
[20:53] in Bible days. You know, it's incredible
[20:55] too. You know, we could spend literally
[20:58] days and you know, just going just
[21:00] reading scripture. You can see it's
[21:01] fulfilled in this day and now that we're
[21:02] alive in and it's just like the two on
[21:05] the way to Emmas. Hundreds of prophecies
[21:07] were fulfilled in the last few moments
[21:09] of Jesus' life. And they didn't fully
[21:11] comprehend what was going on, but they
[21:13] were being ushered or they were being
[21:15] led, I'll put it that way, they were
[21:18] being led to the upper room. The two on
[21:21] the way to Emmas, Mary Magdalene and the
[21:23] other woman that went to the went to the
[21:25] tomb, they found the stone rolled away.
[21:27] They had no idea what was going on. They
[21:29] had a visitation of angels and you know,
[21:31] they knew all about making spices and
[21:33] anointing the dead cuz Lazarus had died
[21:35] and they buried him. So, they knew what
[21:37] it was like to bury someone. And you
[21:38] know, death is part of life. But they
[21:40] had never ever had an experience where
[21:44] they came to a tomb and someone didn't
[21:46] call the dead forth, but the dead just
[21:48] wasn't there. And he just wasn't there.
[21:50] But angel said he's risen as he told you
[21:53] he's risen. And so they knew a lot about
[21:55] burying the dead and anointing the dead
[21:57] and making spices for the dead. But they
[22:00] had no idea really of what they're about
[22:02] to step into. But their life, they were
[22:05] being led into the upper room. There are
[22:08] 120 people that were ordained by God and
[22:12] they had to be there on the day of
[22:13] Pentecost where it just wasn't God with
[22:16] them. But now God was going to go in his
[22:18] people and their whole life was actually
[22:20] they were being directed. They were
[22:23] being led into this very day into this
[22:25] very moment. Amen. They were being now
[22:29] to be
[22:30] ushered. I just wanted this this word
[22:33] kind of gripped me today just you know
[22:36] now an usher we know lead someone just
[22:40] say in church you know or at a feast at
[22:43] a at a at a at a meal where you have a
[22:46] seated place and normally you would go
[22:48] to the door someone would be an usher
[22:50] and they'll say I'll take you to your
[22:52] seat so so that person is leading the
[22:55] guest to where they're seated amen so
[22:58] they're being ushered they've come under
[22:59] an influence of another And that
[23:01] influence is leading them to their seat.
[23:04] Yeah, that's what an usher does. And an
[23:06] usher is a show or a
[23:09] guide. Amen. It's also a cause or mark
[23:13] of the start of something new. This is I
[23:16] just this is just from Google. Amen. And
[23:19] so it's
[23:20] a it's it is it is where someone is led
[23:25] from one place to another and the place
[23:27] they're being led to has already been
[23:29] determined.
[23:31] Amen. So just say if you've been invited
[23:33] to a wedding and and you're going to be
[23:36] at the reception. Now normally you have
[23:39] to find your own seat but in some
[23:41] weddings you get ushered in. Say
[23:43] welcome. How are you? You know and now
[23:45] I'll take you to your seat. But so so
[23:48] the place you end up sitting at is
[23:50] predetermined. It's already determined.
[23:52] You just have to come under the
[23:54] influence of the usher and then you're
[23:55] at your seat. Very simple illustration,
[23:57] but I trust now God has sent his word in
[24:00] this end time. Amen. And you've come
[24:03] under an influence of a person. Amen.
[24:07] Not a not not a natural man. You haven't
[24:10] come under my influence. I pray. Amen.
[24:12] But but the Holy Spirit has come upon
[24:14] you because faith cometh by hearing and
[24:16] hearing the word of God. And then
[24:18] because remember the word is a person.
[24:20] It's not just a it's not just words on
[24:22] paper. He's a living person. Amen. So
[24:25] now he has come and and he is he is he
[24:28] has gripped you. I trust he's gripped
[24:30] you by his word. And then now he's
[24:33] leading you from this world into the
[24:36] next world. Amen. Amen. Because there's
[24:38] a wedding supper. Amen. Blessed are they
[24:41] that are called to the wedding supper of
[24:43] the lamb. And we understand that those
[24:45] that are called to the wedding supper
[24:48] are born upon the earth. Whatever age
[24:50] they are born in. And the message to
[24:53] that age opens their eyes and they meet
[24:55] God in the age that they're born in.
[24:57] Amen. And the and the final end of those
[25:00] people isn't just to be a witness and
[25:01] then die, but the final end of those
[25:04] people is there's a seat at a wedding
[25:06] feast. Amen. That has their name on it.
[25:09] And the very reason that the word had
[25:12] called them in their hour is because
[25:13] there's a seat there for them to sit on.
[25:15] Hallelujah. Amen. And so when the word
[25:18] when the word comes your way, you're
[25:20] being ushered. Amen. You're being led.
[25:23] Amen. Amen. From this world to the next.
[25:25] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[25:29] And you can see it all the way through
[25:31] the Bible. You can take anyone. You can
[25:33] take Joseph. His dreams because remember
[25:36] he had dreams that his family, his
[25:37] brothers bowed down to him. His whole
[25:40] life was ushering him to the right hand
[25:42] of Pharaoh.
[25:44] Amen. He come those dreams became so
[25:46] real. Gripped his life. Didn't matter if
[25:48] he was being taken as a slave down into
[25:50] Egypt, wherever he was in prison, he
[25:52] knew those had to be fulfilled. And they
[25:55] were ushering, they were leading him
[25:57] from just being just being his favorite,
[25:59] his dad's favorite
[26:02] son to the place he had to be, which is
[26:05] at the right hand of Pharaoh. You take
[26:07] David. I I know I've used these
[26:08] illustrations, but I want you to look at
[26:10] these people very differently because
[26:12] they came under the same influence
[26:14] you've come under. Amen. David was
[26:16] anointed to be king and then I could say
[26:19] that anointing came upon him says the
[26:21] spirit of God was with him from that day
[26:22] on and he was being ushered to the
[26:24] throne.
[26:26] Amen. Rahab much the same way when you
[26:29] know you know when when Naomi said I'm
[26:32] going to go back to Israel. I hear
[26:33] there's grain there back again and Ruth
[26:36] makes the decision where you die I'll
[26:38] die. Your people will be my people. Your
[26:40] God will be my God. Amen. The influence
[26:43] of Naomi ushered Ruth because remember
[26:48] Ruth didn't know where she was going.
[26:50] Naomi knew where she was going. We're
[26:52] going back to Bethlehem, the house of
[26:53] God's bread. Amen. Where she had to be.
[26:56] And so Naomi was ushering Ruth. Even
[26:59] though she didn't fully know understand
[27:01] what was going on and where their future
[27:02] would be, God knew where their future
[27:04] was going to be. Amen. So Naomi ushered
[27:07] Ruth come out. You have to marry Boaz.
[27:11] Out of you, out of your marriage has to
[27:13] come a line of kings. Amen. That the
[27:16] that the son of David is going to be
[27:18] attributed. Amen. Christ is going to be
[27:19] attributed to your great great grandson
[27:22] or whatever it is out of your lineage.
[27:24] Hallelujah. There was an ushering going
[27:26] on. Amen.
[27:29] Now in a traditional
[27:32] feast in a traditional feast if we go to
[27:36] let's just go to Luke chapter
[27:41] 14 now Luke chapter
[27:49] 14 here. No, Matthew 266. Forgive me.
[27:54] That's the That's the parable. I don't
[27:55] want the parable. I want the
[28:03] There he
[28:04] was. Now Jesus was invited to a
[28:09] Pharisees house for a
[28:10] feast. And brother makes a statement and
[28:14] it's so if you could just grasp the
[28:16] statement. He says Jesus always goes
[28:18] where he's invited. Amen. Because Jesus
[28:21] was invited to Simon's house. He wasn't
[28:24] welcome, but he was invited. And so even
[28:28] even because they wanted to make fun of
[28:30] Jesus. Amen. They wanted him to be the
[28:32] entertainment for the feast. It was the
[28:34] very God made flesh that that the
[28:36] Pharisees thought they were worshiping.
[28:38] They invited God to their feast, but
[28:40] they just wanted to make fun of him. So
[28:43] he always comes where he is invited.
[28:46] Remember, he's the same yesterday,
[28:47] today, and forever. Hallelujah. So now
[28:50] let's just read here from verse six. Now
[28:52] when Jesus was in Bethany in the house
[28:54] of Simon the leper, there came unto him
[28:56] a woman having an alabaster box of very
[28:58] precious ointment poured on his head as
[29:00] he sat at meat. But when the disciples
[29:03] when the disciples saw it, they had
[29:05] indignation saying to what purpose is
[29:07] the
[29:07] waste? Now wait, sorry, I may have
[29:10] the I have the sorry I have the wrong
[29:13] Anyway, we'll read it anyway. This
[29:15] people don't understand the inspiration
[29:17] people are under. When Jesus understood
[29:19] it, for this ointment might have been
[29:20] sold for much, and given to the poor.
[29:22] For when Jesus understood it, he said
[29:24] unto him, "Why trouble ye the woman? For
[29:26] he hath wrought a good work unto me. For
[29:29] they for ye have the poor always with
[29:31] you, but me ye have not always. For in
[29:34] that she hath poured this ointment on my
[29:36] body, she did it for my burial. Verily,
[29:38] I say unto you, wherefore this gospel is
[29:40] preached the in the whole world, uh
[29:43] there shall also uh also this that this
[29:45] woman hath done shall be told a memorial
[29:48] for her. Now, forgive me, I got the
[29:52] wrong parable. I mean, the wrong story,
[29:53] but you know the story of Simon the
[29:55] Pharisee as well. He had a feast. Now,
[29:58] in the Jewish custom, someone comes to
[30:00] the door and Jesus speaks about it in
[30:03] parables. Someone comes to the door,
[30:05] there's a man that washes the feet of
[30:07] the people and then a robe is put upon
[30:10] them and they're anointed with with you
[30:13] with oil and perfumes and then they're
[30:16] welcomed, kissed and made welcome. Amen.
[30:20] And it said Jesus comes to this feast
[30:22] and there is a woman who's not invited
[30:24] either, but she knew Jesus was there and
[30:27] she sold and she was a she was a
[30:29] prostitute and she took all of her
[30:31] earnings and she went and bought an
[30:34] alabaster box. Amen. Of precious
[30:37] precious perfumes and and and oils. And
[30:40] she and she somehow got into the feast
[30:43] and and anointed Jesus's feet and wiped
[30:47] her wiped his feet with her hair and her
[30:50] tears. And now and then and then and
[30:53] then Simon the Pharisee said in his
[30:55] heart, "If Jesus really was a prophet,
[30:58] he would know what kind of woman this
[31:00] was."
[31:02] And then said, "Jesus, just let her let
[31:05] her wash his feet with her tears." And
[31:08] then he says,"Simon, I've got one thing
[31:10] to say unto you." He says, "My feet
[31:14] haven't been washed, yet she washes my
[31:17] feet with her tears. I wasn't I wasn't
[31:20] anointed with, you know, perfumes and
[31:21] things, but she's done this for me, and
[31:23] I wasn't made welcome." And so, there
[31:25] was a process of how people came into a
[31:28] feast. Amen. And so, they came, there's
[31:32] one door into the feast. Remember, Jesus
[31:34] is the door. And then their feet are
[31:37] washed. Amen. So the world is washed off
[31:40] you. Amen. Then a robe is put upon you,
[31:43] the robe of his righteousness. And then
[31:45] you're anointed. And it doesn't matter
[31:47] if you're rich or poor or whatever you
[31:49] are after you go through the process.
[31:51] You're all the same. You all look the
[31:53] same. And the master of the feast, you
[31:56] know, welcomes the guests after they're
[31:58] ready.
[32:00] Now, from the door to in the feast,
[32:03] there's an ushering.
[32:06] Amen. You go here now. Welcome. Come
[32:09] this way. Sit down here. I'll wash your
[32:10] feet now. Welcome. Come this way. I'll
[32:12] put a robe on you. Come here. Person's
[32:16] anointed. They are led from one place to
[32:18] the other. You following me? It's much
[32:22] like us. And then Jesus makes the
[32:23] parable where there was a feast like
[32:25] that, but a man didn't have on the
[32:27] garment. He says, "How did you get in
[32:29] here?" Amen. And the and the guy was
[32:32] speechless. And the king said, "Tie him
[32:34] up and throw him into out of darkness."
[32:36] And he said, "If someone got in, he
[32:38] didn't have the robe on, and the robe is
[32:40] is the Holy Ghost." Remember, we're
[32:41] robed in his righteousness.
[32:45] Amen. So, there's an ushering taking
[32:54] place. So, you have to be led from one
[32:59] in. Amen.
[33:02] Now Jesus said in John
[33:07] 14 and we did say this in our prayer but
[33:12] he says let your let not your heart be
[33:15] troubled believe uh ye believe in God
[33:18] believe also in me and my father's house
[33:21] or actually kingdom because this is King
[33:22] James language in my father's kingdom or
[33:24] house are many mansions or palaces if it
[33:27] were not so I would have told you I go
[33:30] to prepare a place for you. And if I go
[33:32] and prepare a place for you, I will come
[33:34] again and receive you unto myself, that
[33:36] where I am, there you may be also. And
[33:40] whether I go, you know, and the way you
[33:43] know. Now, so Jesus makes a promise. I'm
[33:47] going to go and prepare a place for you.
[33:49] I know you know this may be very
[33:51] elementary but if there's a place
[33:53] prepared like I saying at a feast then
[33:55] there has to be someone has to come back
[33:57] now and usher the guests into that
[34:00] place. Amen. And and he says in his word
[34:05] I will come and if I go I'll come again
[34:07] and receive you to myself that where I
[34:10] am not where you are where I am you'll
[34:12] be also.
[34:14] Amen.
[34:16] So he promises, I'm going to prepare a
[34:18] place and then I'm going to come and get
[34:20] you, receive you to myself and take you
[34:23] there. Amen. And so he's saying that he
[34:27] is personally going to do this. And so
[34:29] when you see like you take Malachi 4,
[34:32] you take brother Brandham, you know,
[34:34] many people get caught up in him, but he
[34:36] wasn't the one doing the work. He says,
[34:39] I wanted to be a hunter. I wanted to be
[34:41] a trapper, you know, but it was God
[34:43] actually working through the vessel to
[34:45] receive people to himself. Amen. It
[34:49] wasn't it wasn't his ministry. It wasn't
[34:50] his natural way of doing, you know, it
[34:52] wasn't him doing it. It was it was God
[34:55] himself. He says in the token message,
[34:57] he says Jesus has more success in this
[35:01] ministry than he did in his earthly
[35:03] ministry. And he says, "No," and and if
[35:06] you go read it or listen to it, he says,
[35:07] "Notice, I said he has more success."
[35:10] Amen. Because of all the multitudes of
[35:11] the healings and miracles that were
[35:13] done. Amen. He had more success in this
[35:16] day than he had when he was there in the
[35:18] days of his flesh. And so it was not the
[35:20] man doing it. It was God in the man
[35:22] doing it. Amen. Amen. So
[35:26] now, so now here comes one. Remember we
[35:29] read there in John chapter 10, he says,
[35:30] he says, "The porter opens the door."
[35:33] Amen. And then the shepherd goes out,
[35:35] leads his sheep. So there's someone at
[35:37] the door that opens the door.
[35:40] Amen. So here we had a man and it's
[35:43] always it's not the man but it's the man
[35:45] but it's not the man. You must
[35:47] understand because it's God doing all
[35:49] the same things. Yeah. And so now here
[35:51] we have a ministry upon the earth that's
[35:53] actually introducing the people giving
[35:57] out the robes.
[35:59] Amen. He's giving out the robes to the
[36:01] wedding feast. Amen. Because the robe is
[36:04] not a you don't go down to a shop and
[36:06] buy the robe like some people put on
[36:08] white robes and say, "Look at me." It's
[36:09] not that. The robe is the Holy Ghost.
[36:12] Amen. And faith cometh by hearing and
[36:14] hearing the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[36:17] Now, I'm not doing mental uh gymnastics
[36:20] here. Amen. But there's there's he's
[36:24] preached now a word. And you receive
[36:27] that word which is Christ. Amen. And by
[36:30] receiving that word, what he did for you
[36:32] on Calvary comes into effect in your
[36:35] life. That you become as righteous as he
[36:37] is righteous. That we, that's why we can
[36:39] sing. He's washed away all my sin. I'm
[36:42] amazed that he loved me. I'm amazed that
[36:43] he care. Through his precious blood, I
[36:46] found pardon. He's washed all my sin
[36:47] away. Amen. Amen. Because it becomes a
[36:50] reality. So you go from a unbeliever to
[36:53] a believer. You go from a sinner to a
[36:55] saint. Amen. But remember, always in
[36:58] you, buried under that unbelief was a
[37:01] person with an invitation to a feast.
[37:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Always buried down.
[37:05] Just like David, he was always meant to
[37:07] be king. He just had to be anointed then
[37:09] be ushered into his kingship.
[37:11] Hallelujah. And it's the same thing with
[37:14] you and I. We have an invitation. And
[37:16] that's why when the word comes your way,
[37:18] it speaks to you. Amen. Like it maybe
[37:20] not speak to other people, but it speaks
[37:22] to you. Amen. And it becomes alive to
[37:26] you because you begin to recognize this
[37:27] world is not my home. There's more than
[37:30] just these five senses. You know, we're
[37:32] not just a bunch of animals like the
[37:34] rest of the animal kingdom. As I say,
[37:36] you know, as I said before, you go back
[37:38] to the times of Jesus. The chimpanzees
[37:40] then do the same chimpan thing the
[37:42] chimpanzees do today. That's right. But
[37:44] in those days, there was a horse and
[37:45] buggy. Now we're in space. There's
[37:48] something different. And it's 99% 99.9%
[37:51] the same DNA as you is in a chimpanzeee.
[37:55] Amen. So it's just more than just
[37:57] genetics. Yeah. Amen. That's right. And
[38:01] so there's something in us that's crying
[38:03] for God. Amen.
[38:07] Now faith is the evidence of things
[38:10] unseen. Hebrews 11. So now if there's
[38:15] something drawing
[38:16] you, Amen. If there's if if you have
[38:20] faith and these and we know that these
[38:23] five senses aren't made to do to to
[38:25] contact God. We know it's not that way.
[38:28] But there's a faith in us that knows
[38:30] that there's more to life than just
[38:31] this. Amen. And brother brother Brandon
[38:35] makes a real simple statement. He just
[38:37] takes a bit of the Psalms. He says, "The
[38:38] deep calling to the deep." Amen. And he
[38:41] says if there's a deep in here, there
[38:44] has to be a deep to respond. And he says
[38:47] there's a reason. The reason the deep is
[38:49] in here is because there is that deep.
[38:51] So that deep was there before there was
[38:53] a deep in here. Amen. So if there's a
[38:57] longing,
[38:59] this world is not our home. Amen.
[39:02] There's a rapture call has gone out upon
[39:04] the earth to take a people from this
[39:06] world to usher a people from this world
[39:08] into the next world.
[39:10] Amen. So if there's a deep calling, not
[39:13] a fear, not a, oh, I don't want to go
[39:15] through the tribulation or not a fear of
[39:18] being lost, but there's a deep call.
[39:20] Lord, I want to I want to crown you king
[39:22] of kings and lord of lords. I want to be
[39:25] one of those redeemed ones. I want to
[39:27] sing your praises throughout all
[39:28] eternity. Amen. I want to see you as you
[39:31] are. Not just feel your presence and not
[39:33] just be anointed, but I want to see you
[39:35] as you are. I want this veil of this
[39:37] this dimension to be ripped in twain.
[39:39] Amen. I can step into the eternity. If
[39:42] there's a deep if there's a deep call,
[39:44] there's a deep to respond. Amen.
[39:46] Hallelujah.
[39:48] You got to recognize it, friends. That's
[39:50] right. Amen. We've we we're being
[39:52] ushered in. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[39:55] Amen. So, so if there's something if
[39:57] there's something in here, there's a
[40:00] there's a heaven to go to. If there's
[40:02] something in here for a rapture, there's
[40:03] a rapture to have. Amen. Amen. If
[40:05] there's something in here to have a new
[40:07] body, there's a new body to have. And
[40:10] remember, Paul says very plainly, if
[40:12] this I'll just use I'll just use modern
[40:15] modern language. If this body is reduced
[40:17] to I've
[40:19] got waiting
[40:25] already go on the rapture, it's because
[40:27] there's a call from an eternal body that
[40:30] you have in the heavens. Amen.
[40:33] The scripture says, he says, "If this
[40:35] earthly tabernacle be dissolved, I have
[40:38] one waiting already eternal in the
[40:40] heavens." That's what he says. That's
[40:42] the Bible. Amen. So, if there's a
[40:45] longing to put on that body,
[40:49] hello. You know, Ellie, you know,
[40:51] Annalie said to me the other day, "I
[40:52] want to go to heaven. It's taking a long
[40:54] time." She did. She was upset. Said, "We
[40:57] just enjoy life. We're here to have, you
[40:59] know, we're here just to enjoy the, you
[41:00] know, praise the Lord and just, you
[41:02] know, enjoy life, aren't we? Amen. I
[41:06] said, well, you others have got to come
[41:07] in, but, you know, I want to, she's, I
[41:08] want to go to heaven. It's taking a long
[41:10] time. She's not even five.
[41:13] Amen. But praise the Lord. And but, you
[41:16] know, but because if there's a
[41:19] longing
[41:21] now, we, as I said, this is why this
[41:25] word has come to you. This is why this
[41:28] message has come to you. I trust this
[41:30] means this means a lot to me. Amen. The
[41:33] reason is he said well I'm just going to
[41:36] read it.
[41:38] Now we
[41:40] understand I just want to read this from
[41:42] the latest church age. Now there's a
[41:46] reason why prophets say things a certain
[41:47] way and this stumbles people but me
[41:50] doesn't stumble me. Okay? We've seen the
[41:54] eggshaped cars that drive
[41:56] themselves. Amen. We've seen everything
[41:58] he prophesied about
[42:00] 1933. Amen. He said Mussolini would take
[42:03] Ethiopia. And he
[42:05] did. Hitler would, you know, Hitler
[42:07] would rise up. You know, there'd be
[42:09] fascism, Nazism, and communism, and
[42:12] communism would swallow up the other
[42:14] two. And they did. Amen. We've seen the
[42:17] moral decay of the world. We've seen the
[42:20] great advances in technology. We've seen
[42:22] the Catholic Church rise in America and
[42:24] it has. Amen. We've seen the, you know,
[42:27] the, you know, the, you know, the, you
[42:29] know, the eggshaped cars, he said,
[42:30] driving themselves down the road, which
[42:32] we have. He said the last one is a
[42:34] miracle be smoke bombs and craters and
[42:36] it will be. If the others have happened,
[42:39] this will happen.
[42:41] But in the scripture in the book of
[42:42] Acts, you've got to understand as Jesus
[42:46] now Jesus was sent to the Jews to gather
[42:50] the last of the Jews because the word he
[42:53] was going to turn to the Gentiles. Yeah.
[42:57] So when now when when Jesus was
[43:01] crucified upon
[43:03] Calvary, it was the Jews rejecting their
[43:06] Messiah. But they had to reject them
[43:09] because the Gentiles had to come in.
[43:11] Yeah. Because you see the types the
[43:13] shadows in the Old Testament like uh
[43:16] Joseph's sons, you know, Jacob crossed
[43:19] his hands that the blessing would go to
[43:21] the younger instead of the older of
[43:23] Joseph's two sons. And it's like Jacob
[43:25] got the birthight instead of Esau. The
[43:28] firstborn in the Old Testament always
[43:29] got the birthight. Yeah. And so so the
[43:32] second born got the birthight ahead of
[43:35] the firstborn. And so what you enjoy the
[43:38] Jew should have, but God in his grace
[43:42] through the cross now would would
[43:44] actually put the blessing upon the
[43:45] second, the Gentile instead of the
[43:47] firstborn.
[43:49] Amen. And so that's why that's why you
[43:51] see Jesus is crucified. They reject him.
[43:54] He came to his own, but his own received
[43:56] him not. And then on the day of
[43:57] Pentecost, it's all a Jewish church. And
[43:59] then very quickly, I just Googled it
[44:02] real quick just just using I mean use a
[44:04] calculator rather. Um the dates from
[44:08] AD33 to AD45. AD33 we know Pentecost.
[44:13] Amen. Death, burial, resurrection, Jesus
[44:15] Christ, coming of the Holy Ghost,
[44:16] Pentecost. AD45 in my Bible is when Paul
[44:20] and Silas say to the Jews, because you
[44:22] find yourself, I'm worthy of eternal
[44:23] life. Lo, I turn to the Gentiles. It's
[44:26] only a few years. But that time there's
[44:28] an overlap because all the Jewish church
[44:32] and then the Gentiles start coming in.
[44:33] And as the Gentiles start coming, the
[44:35] Jews start going out. And then now when
[44:37] when Jesus is is is revealing himself to
[44:41] John in the book of Revelation, those
[44:43] seven church ages are all gentile
[44:45] churches. There's not one to Jerusalem
[44:47] or Antioch or any of those. It's the
[44:49] Jewish church. I mean, it's to Gentile
[44:51] churches because by that time, the vast
[44:54] majority of believers are gentile.
[44:57] Yeah. But because the gospel has to go
[45:00] back to the Jews for three and a half
[45:01] years, there's a repeat. There's a
[45:04] reverse of the process where the
[45:06] Gentiles start to fade out and the Jews
[45:08] come in. That's right. Amen. Yeah. It
[45:12] has to happen. But when the gospel goes
[45:14] back to the Jews, the brides of the
[45:16] wedding supper, right?
[45:18] Yeah. So there's a that that repeats
[45:22] itself. Now, I say that because I want
[45:24] to read
[45:25] this. He says, now this is just coming
[45:28] in through the end of it. He says, "The
[45:30] seventh and last vision, this is page
[45:32] 322 if you want to read it. The last and
[45:34] seventh vision was there and I heard a
[45:37] terrible most terrible explosions. I
[45:39] turned to look and saw nothing but
[45:40] debris craters and smoke all over the
[45:42] land of America." Now, listen to how he
[45:44] says this, cuz some people say, "Well,
[45:46] he says this, so he's wrong." But look
[45:47] how he says it. Based on these seven
[45:49] visions along with the rapid changes
[45:52] which have swept the world in the last
[45:54] 50 years, I
[45:56] predict I do not prophesy. He says, I
[45:59] predict that these visions will all come
[46:02] to pass by
[46:03] 1977. Yeah. And though many may feel
[46:07] this is irresponsible statement in the
[46:09] view of the fact that Jesus said that no
[46:10] man knoweth the day nor hour, I still
[46:13] maintain this prediction after 30 years
[46:15] because Jesus did not say no man would
[46:17] know the year, month or week in which
[46:19] his coming was to be completed. So I
[46:22] repeat, I sincerely believe and maintain
[46:25] as a private student of the word along
[46:26] with divine inspiration that 1977, now
[46:29] listen to this, ought to terminate the
[46:33] world
[46:33] systems and usher in the
[46:37] millennium. Now I said there's a it's a
[46:41] repeat. It's a reverse of what happened
[46:43] in the beginning. Yeah.
[46:45] So in the days of Paul and
[46:49] Silas, the Jewish world systems, because
[46:53] a religion that's just a religion of man
[46:55] is a world system. Yeah, it is. It's
[46:59] just part of this world. Yeah. It
[47:01] doesn't matter if it's Jewish or any any
[47:04] just organization of man. That's a world
[47:06] system.
[47:08] So when Paul and Silas say, "Lo, I turn
[47:10] to the Gentiles," there was a
[47:12] termination of the Jewish systems.
[47:15] Amen. It all came to an end for them.
[47:18] Yeah. It all came to an end. And so he's
[47:22] saying that 1977 ought to terminate the
[47:24] world systems and usher in the
[47:26] millennium. And that's why if you go
[47:28] back in church history, you have brother
[47:31] Brown's ministry. Then God is working
[47:33] among
[47:35] denomination. And then those testimonies
[47:37] go down.
[47:39] Amen. Then now as time goes along, the
[47:42] testimonies of the bride go up.
[47:44] of God working. Amen. I'm talking about
[47:47] real genuine things now. Not talking
[47:50] about the, you know, Toronto blessing of
[47:53] the laughing and the, you know, the
[47:54] barking and acting like animals and all
[47:56] these different things. I'm talking
[47:58] about genuine move of God.
[48:00] Amen. I trust this is not too much. Now,
[48:03] if you don't if you think this is a bit
[48:05] much, just just just say, "Well, this is
[48:06] just been okay. But there has to be a
[48:09] repeat of the process."
[48:11] So when he says now that 1977 ought to
[48:14] terminate the world system, he's saying
[48:16] now they've come to an end,
[48:19] the overlap is ending because it goes
[48:21] from the denomination. The bride has
[48:23] called out the denomination.
[48:25] Amen. Have you not been? Yeah. And then
[48:29] that means the because Jesus says,
[48:32] "Behold, I stand the door and knock." If
[48:34] anyone hears my voice, let him open the
[48:37] door and I'll come and s with him and he
[48:38] with me. Amen. So there has to come a
[48:41] time and we know that he was rejected
[48:44] you know in the 60s. Amen. But then he
[48:47] says that then he but then this is all
[48:50] terminated in 90 this is me now
[48:53] 1977 and it ought to and usher in the
[48:57] millennium. Now many people say well
[48:59] he's wrong because it's past 1977. Look
[49:02] what he says. He says this should come
[49:04] to an end and now it ought to usher in
[49:07] the millennium. The word usher, what
[49:09] happens? And ushering is a period of
[49:11] time. Amen. You meet brother Kaben at
[49:14] the front door. He says, "Can I take you
[49:16] to your seat?" There's a period of time
[49:18] from the front door to your seat. Amen.
[49:20] You're being ushered. There's a man
[49:22] standing at the door ushering you to
[49:23] your seat. Hallelujah. There's a deacon
[49:25] there ushering you to your seat. So,
[49:27] he's saying now there's come an end of
[49:29] time and now it's going to usher in the
[49:32] millennium. Amen. Amen. Now, in order
[49:35] for there to be a millennium, there has
[49:36] to be be a bride to rule and reign in
[49:39] the millennium.
[49:40] Amen. So, what's happening now? Those
[49:44] people, you I trust you can say that's
[49:47] me. Amen. There's a people now. So, it's
[49:52] not just the millennium. Oh, now we're
[49:53] facing a millennium. But now there's a
[49:55] people being ushered. Amen. There's a
[49:58] there's a there's an influence coming
[50:00] upon these people. Hallelujah. And now
[50:03] basically he's saying, "I'll take you.
[50:05] I'm going to take you into the
[50:06] millennium. I'm going to guide you
[50:07] through and you can go." It's just like
[50:10] King David or any of the any of the
[50:12] believers. They were they were ushered
[50:14] into where they were finally meant to
[50:15] end up. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And it's
[50:19] the same with you and I. We're being
[50:22] ushered.
[50:23] Amen. God is ushering you into the
[50:26] millennium. God is ushering you into a
[50:29] body change.
[50:31] Hallelujah.
[50:35] Amen. This is where we are,
[50:38] folks. Amen. This is
[50:41] why remember, sure, we can say, "Oh, the
[50:44] world's getting bad." But that pales,
[50:47] that should pale in comparison to this
[50:50] body's going to get changed soon and
[50:51] very soon. It's prophesied to happen, is
[50:55] it not?
[50:56] Just like you take this
[50:59] Bible, there's thousands of prophecies
[51:02] in this
[51:03] Bible. Most of them have already come to
[51:05] pass. Amen. And if we believe the same
[51:09] God wrote the first five books and then
[51:11] wrote Joshua and then Judges, Joshua,
[51:14] Judges, Ruth, and then Kings and
[51:15] Chronicles and all the different books
[51:17] all the way down through to Revelation.
[51:20] We believe the same God wrote it all
[51:22] through man. Amen. Amen. That means if
[51:25] this bit's been fulfilled and this bit's
[51:27] been fulfilled and this bit's been
[51:29] fulfilled and this is being fulfilled
[51:31] and this has yet to be fulfilled.
[51:34] If this has already been done, if this
[51:36] has been fulfilled, this is sure going
[51:38] to be fulfilled.
[51:40] Amen. If this happened, this is going to
[51:42] happen.
[51:44] Amen. And the man, the more man looks,
[51:46] the more they find that this really did
[51:47] happen.
[51:49] Amen. You go through history. History
[51:52] knows Jesus was alive. History knows
[51:55] Paul did what he did. Amen. History
[51:58] knows that all the church age messengers
[51:59] were alive.
[52:01] History knows the ministry brother
[52:03] Barham had.
[52:05] Amen. Even people who don't believe it,
[52:07] they they attribute
[52:10] they attribute the postw World War II
[52:12] healing revival. They said he had a
[52:14] ministry that surpassed anything else
[52:15] upon the earth. That's not just to
[52:18] excite people. Oh, God's here. There's a
[52:21] reason. Because I'm going to begin an
[52:22] ushering in. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[52:26] That's right.
[52:28] And why? Now, see, this is what I thank
[52:31] God for. And and I'm going to close with
[52:35] this. Normally in church history,
[52:38] churches start and then they become
[52:40] formal. They cool off. Now, the bride of
[52:43] Christ is birthed.
[52:46] She doesn't become formal. Amen. Amen.
[52:49] But it gets greater and greater and more
[52:52] and God becomes more real. Amen. And
[52:55] what's been happening? What's been
[52:57] happening among us? Amen. This is all
[52:59] over the world, but here we are. Amen.
[53:02] What's happening? And God bursts us into
[53:04] the kingdom and he gets greater and
[53:06] greater and more and more and more
[53:09] because he's showing he's showing you
[53:11] you're at the end. Remember, there has
[53:13] to be a quick short work upon the earth.
[53:15] There has to be a mighty display of his
[53:17] power. one more time. Yes, sir. Amen.
[53:19] And who's he going to use his church?
[53:21] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[53:23] Amen.
[53:24] Hallelujah. And that's where we are. You
[53:26] know, there's a there's a there's a
[53:29] brother who he was brother Bram's
[53:32] organist in his later later
[53:35] meetings. And he could see the ministry
[53:37] brother Bram had. Now, I'm going to
[53:39] close with this. You can go I um I'll
[53:41] put the link on the WhatsApp. Um, and he
[53:44] could see the ministry brother Bram had,
[53:46] but he's wondering why he didn't have
[53:47] the crowds. And he said to Brother B,
[53:49] you know, Brother Bram actually took him
[53:50] out for lunch one day. And he said, you
[53:52] know, Brother Bram, all you need to do,
[53:54] just let me market your campaigns.
[53:56] You'll get way more people. And he says,
[53:58] no, actually, now this guy doesn't
[54:00] believe the message. He said, he said,
[54:02] actually, my ministry is
[54:04] through. He said, well, what what's
[54:06] going to happen now? He said,
[54:08] "Well, I'm going to go and then there's
[54:11] going to be a time of teaching the
[54:14] people their position in Christ." And
[54:16] then after that, God is going to shake
[54:19] the earth one more time with those
[54:20] people. That's right. Amen. And what is
[54:24] happening?
[54:26] Amen. Amen. Remember there's two on the
[54:29] way to Emmas. Jesus is Jesus. Remember
[54:32] he was the word but he and and remember
[54:36] brother preacher assumment modern events
[54:38] are made clear by the prophecy. And he
[54:40] goes to Luke chapter 24 the two on the
[54:42] way to Emmas in there and he's saying
[54:44] that that chapter the resurrection is a
[54:46] prophecy.
[54:48] You understand? It's a prophecy. And so
[54:50] if it's a prophecy then it has to be
[54:52] fulfilled.
[54:54] Amen. And what he's saying is modern
[54:56] events. He says, "Modern events are made
[54:58] clear by the
[54:59] prophecy. Go away and listen to it." So
[55:02] he's saying, now remember when he's
[55:04] alive, the Cold Wars at its height. You
[55:06] know, people are scared about bombs and
[55:08] radiation and all kinds of, you know,
[55:10] nuclear bombs and nuclear war and all
[55:13] the communism rising up. But he's
[55:15] actually saying, "No, these modern
[55:17] events are made clear by Luke 24."
[55:21] Amen. The the death, burial,
[55:23] resurrection of Jesus Christ. And he
[55:25] takes the two on the way to
[55:27] Emmas and Jesus, he didn't have a Bible
[55:30] like this because he was the word. And
[55:32] then brother Abraham says, "Well, wasn't
[55:34] he, you know, did the did he not cry
[55:37] out, my God, my God, why is thou
[55:38] forsaken me like it says in this place?"
[55:40] And didn't they pierce my hands and you
[55:42] you hands his feet and goes to the
[55:44] Psalms and he goes all the way down
[55:46] through, you know, and they had six
[55:48] hours of of of fulfilled scripture in
[55:51] their day. What is happening? the word,
[55:55] the word made flesh, who's resurrected.
[55:58] These people think the world's these two
[56:00] that think the world's falling apart,
[56:01] but they're in the greatest. They're
[56:03] being ushered into the upper room.
[56:04] Hallelujah. Amen. They're being ushered
[56:06] into the upper room. We think sometimes
[56:09] our worlds are falling apart. Amen. But
[56:12] you're being ushered into a rapture.
[56:14] Hallelujah. Amen. You're being us, you
[56:17] know, ushered into a rapture. And that's
[56:18] why he began to show them the the word
[56:21] is being fulfilled and they're walking
[56:23] with him and he's opening the scripture
[56:24] all the time to them. And then he did
[56:27] something he did before he died. He took
[56:29] the bread and he blessed it and their
[56:30] eyes became open. And then they
[56:33] recognized he had risen. Amen. Now I'm
[56:35] going to put it this
[56:37] way. Now here comes a prophet and he
[56:40] begins to open up the scripture and he
[56:42] speaks about Christ as the mystery of
[56:44] God revealed. Speaking about Christ in
[56:46] you. having pre preeminence in you, you
[56:50] becoming one with him and then him
[56:51] restoring Eden again. Amen. He and he
[56:54] talks about the invisible union of the
[56:56] bride in Christ and the mighty God
[56:58] unveiled before us. And he says it's
[57:00] that same God is veiled in you. Amen.
[57:03] Amen. And he speaks about you know you
[57:06] know the message of grace. He speaks
[57:08] about the man and he and he speaks about
[57:11] it in that he says this is what grace is
[57:12] like. He says, "It's like a man murders
[57:15] a king's son." And then the king's men
[57:17] have this man, this murderer put into
[57:19] jail. The king comes down into the jail.
[57:22] He says, "Why did you do it?" He says,
[57:24] "Well, I was just angry. You know, I
[57:28] just did it. I, you know, I don't know
[57:29] why I just killed them. You know, I
[57:30] killed him." And this king full of anger
[57:32] just storms out of the prison. That man
[57:34] knows he's condemned to die. Amen. And
[57:38] then here comes a carriage and a red
[57:41] carpet's rolled out to a cell and the
[57:43] door is open. The king comes out of the
[57:45] carriage and says, "Now I'm going to
[57:47] take you. I'm going to make you my son."
[57:50] Hallelujah. And he puts the robe on him.
[57:52] And then the very murderer becomes the
[57:53] son of the king. He says, "That's what
[57:55] grace is like." Amen. Amen. Where you
[57:58] didn't earn nothing. It's God says, "I
[58:00] like you and I've made you in my image
[58:02] and I've washed you." Amen. White as
[58:04] snow.
[58:06] Hallelujah. And that's why brother B
[58:08] would say you never did it in the first
[58:09] place. Amen. Where the very record of
[58:12] your life, God takes, he puts it in the
[58:14] bleach of his blood. He pulls it out.
[58:16] There's no more record anymore. Amen.
[58:18] Then you begin to live out this.
[58:22] Hallelujah.
[58:24] And then you could add your name. If if
[58:27] there were more scribes of this Bible,
[58:28] they could go to Hebrews 11 and by faith
[58:32] put you there. Amen. And by faith you by
[58:36] faith he could write this down and he
[58:38] could you know you'd be in here.
[58:41] Hallelujah. And there's a record of
[58:44] Abraham. He staggered not the promise of
[58:45] God. Romans chapter 4. And you but you
[58:48] go down to his natural life and he
[58:50] staggers. He laughs in the presence of
[58:52] God. Amen. He laughs. It wasn't just
[58:55] Sarah laughing. It was Abraham was
[58:57] laughing. That's right. Amen.
[59:01] He had that was not the first visitation
[59:03] he had. There's a few down. He just
[59:05] laughs. God says you're going to have a
[59:07] son. He just laughs in the in the very
[59:09] face of God. Amen. He backslides. Goes
[59:12] out, you know, goes out of the promised
[59:14] land. Tells tells his wife Sarah cuz
[59:17] she's young and beautiful again. Just
[59:19] say that we're brother and sister. I
[59:22] mean, does it
[59:23] twice. Amen. But then even even in that
[59:26] backsliden state, God says to one of
[59:29] those kings, he says he says to him he
[59:32] says if if you take her as your wife,
[59:35] I'm just going to plague your whole
[59:36] country. And the king says, I didn't
[59:38] know he was married to, you know, she
[59:39] was married to Abraham. And he even says
[59:41] in one place, go get Abraham. He's my
[59:43] prophet. Get him to pray for you. Yes,
[59:45] sir. Amen. And here it's not the king
[59:48] wasn't doing, you know, this is
[59:49] Abraham's thing. He hatched up to try
[59:51] and keep his own skin in one piece.
[59:53] Amen. He's backsliden down into a place.
[59:55] But then God says, "This man is my
[59:57] prophet. Restore unto him his wife."
[59:59] Hallelujah. Amen. And here you are. And
[1:00:03] then when remember when Paul writes a
[1:00:05] divine commentary of Abraham's life that
[1:00:09] is not even there. Amen. He says by
[1:00:12] faith he staggered not at the promise of
[1:00:14] God with strong giving praise. He's
[1:00:16] fully persuaded that he is able to do
[1:00:18] which he had promised. Amen. because he
[1:00:21] believed God and it was attributed to
[1:00:23] him for righteousness. Blessed be. Amen.
[1:00:26] And you
[1:00:27] take you take
[1:00:30] him. You take him. He meets
[1:00:32] Melzdc. Amen. And he has all these
[1:00:35] failures, but yet he is not destroyed.
[1:00:39] Amen. You take
[1:00:41] David. David did way more worse things
[1:00:44] than Saul did. Go read their lives. He
[1:00:47] did way worseer things. But God never
[1:00:49] took the kingship from David.
[1:00:52] Amen. And it's because David and even
[1:00:55] David by the law should have been
[1:00:57] killed. Him and Bashibba should have
[1:00:59] been stoned. That's what the law said.
[1:01:01] He was also a murderer.
[1:01:04] Amen. But he was under a different
[1:01:06] covenant than the law. Amen. Because and
[1:01:11] David, remember it's Abraham met
[1:01:14] Melkazedc.
[1:01:16] David writes about Melchisedc and Paul
[1:01:19] writes about
[1:01:20] Melchisedc. Amen. And because Malazdc
[1:01:23] was one the one who brought the bread
[1:01:24] and the wine making, you know, having
[1:01:28] communion with Abraham. So here was the
[1:01:30] king of peace. Amen. Coming God in
[1:01:34] another form coming to the father of the
[1:01:36] faith. And then a natural son of the
[1:01:38] faith, David who should have been killed
[1:01:40] under the law was spared. Amen.
[1:01:44] Now the only reason I can see he was
[1:01:47] spared is because he was under a
[1:01:48] different covenant.
[1:01:50] Amen. He was not under the law. He was
[1:01:53] under grace even during the law. Amen.
[1:01:58] And here you are. Here you are walking
[1:02:02] down life's
[1:02:03] road. Amen. And you have your
[1:02:08] flusterations. Sometimes you don't even
[1:02:10] feel like a Christian.
[1:02:12] Amen.
[1:02:14] Sometimes you don't know which way is
[1:02:15] up,
[1:02:17] but that is not held against you.
[1:02:20] Amen. You got to see God's grace is so
[1:02:23] now it doesn't it doesn't mean you turn
[1:02:25] grace into disgrace. Amen. Because in
[1:02:28] your heart, you want to serve him as
[1:02:29] best as you can. That's right. Amen. But
[1:02:33] God has allowed it in such a way because
[1:02:35] remember, you're being ushered. Amen.
[1:02:37] You're being ushered into a rapture. And
[1:02:39] if your name is at the seat at the
[1:02:40] wedding supper, you have to be there.
[1:02:43] That's right. You have to be there.
[1:02:46] Amen. It's not, oh, where's so and so?
[1:02:48] Oh, no. They didn't make it. I'll put my
[1:02:50] feet up at that seat, sweetheart. You
[1:02:52] know, now I've got a footrest. No, no,
[1:02:54] no, no, no. It's not that way. Why are
[1:02:56] you taking those names off, putting
[1:02:57] other names? I changed my mind. God
[1:02:59] doesn't change his mind. He has a He He
[1:03:02] has a list of people and they're going
[1:03:04] to be there. And the reason they're
[1:03:06] there is because I I I'm sorry. I have
[1:03:09] to quit. I'll maybe pick it up on
[1:03:10] Sunday. But you know the reason there is
[1:03:12] because a person has come to them. Amen.
[1:03:15] Mazdc has come to them. Brother Baron
[1:03:17] preached. Who is this MZDC? And then he
[1:03:20] says in the end of that service he said
[1:03:23] and he and he speaks about that same
[1:03:24] misdc. He says who is this MZDC? Not who
[1:03:27] he was. Who is he now? He says Mazdc
[1:03:30] became Jesus Christ. And then he shows
[1:03:32] that same Jesus Christ is alive and
[1:03:34] well. And there's a woman on a on a cot
[1:03:37] who can't get up. Amen. And God calls
[1:03:40] her out. And then you even hear it at
[1:03:41] the end of the tape. And she gets up.
[1:03:43] She's afflicted. She can't get up. God
[1:03:45] heals her. She gets up. You should hear
[1:03:47] the people. They're just in shock and
[1:03:48] awe. Amen. Cuz that same Mazdc who
[1:03:52] became Jesus Christ is now present.
[1:03:56] Amen. And those ones that come into
[1:03:58] union with
[1:04:00] Melzdc, they're under grace. How do you
[1:04:03] come under grace? Because you become one
[1:04:05] with God. Amen. Because you're being
[1:04:07] ushered. You ever seen bodyguards usher
[1:04:10] someone into a place?
[1:04:12] Stay away from this one. They kick you.
[1:04:14] All everyone who tries to interfere, all
[1:04:16] the protesters, whatever more, they push
[1:04:18] them to one side. They usher the person
[1:04:20] in. You ever seen it? Sometimes looks
[1:04:22] pretty chaotic, but these the security
[1:04:24] detail are determined. This this VIP
[1:04:27] must get in. Amen. How much more are you
[1:04:30] now? Hallelujah. And God walks with you.
[1:04:34] Can we have some musicians to come?
[1:04:36] Otherwise, I'm going to be here a bit
[1:04:37] too long. I don't want to wear you out.
[1:04:39] But you got to understand, you say, I'm
[1:04:41] being ushered. How's your day going? May
[1:04:43] be terrible, but I'm being ushered to
[1:04:45] another land. Amen. How's that decade? I
[1:04:48] don't think it's going too well, but I'm
[1:04:49] being ushered. Hallelujah. I'm being
[1:04:52] led.
[1:04:54] Amen. Hallelujah. This is where we are
[1:04:57] soon and very soon. I'm not just trying
[1:04:59] to excite you. The Bible says it would
[1:05:01] happen in a day like this. Enoch walked
[1:05:04] with God and he was not for God took
[1:05:06] him. So Enoch walked with God, then he
[1:05:09] was ushered. As he was walking with God,
[1:05:11] he was being ushered. There's a there
[1:05:13] was a spot. I don't know. I don't know
[1:05:15] how he w you know, it wasn't just a
[1:05:17] natural walk. We just say it was. That's
[1:05:18] where the rapture takes place. And he
[1:05:20] was being led. I just love to walk down
[1:05:22] this way with God. maybe down some some
[1:05:24] valley or someplace. I don't know. Then
[1:05:26] God says, "Do you want to do you want to
[1:05:28] come up home?"
[1:05:30] Hallelujah. It was just another day for
[1:05:32] Enoch. Amen. This rapture will just be
[1:05:35] another day. He says it just a sweep
[1:05:37] will come down and a moment of twinkling
[1:05:39] of an eye and these atoms will be
[1:05:41] changed. Amen. It'll happen before you
[1:05:44] realize it's happened. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] Brother Brown, when he's taken past the
[1:05:49] curtain of time, now do you believe
[1:05:50] everything else happened in his ministry
[1:05:52] was true? If if that's true, then that
[1:05:55] testimony is true. He was there before
[1:05:57] he realized he was there. You got read
[1:06:00] the account and you know, look, you
[1:06:02] know, and then suddenly he sees his
[1:06:04] body. You know, he's lying there on the
[1:06:05] bed and he's thinking about beyond the
[1:06:07] curtain of time and you know, everything
[1:06:08] that's going on. Then suddenly somehow
[1:06:11] he's up here and he looks and he sees
[1:06:13] his body there. He puts, you know, he
[1:06:15] sees a big green grassy place and all
[1:06:17] these young people, you know, all, you
[1:06:19] know, all the redeemed and he, you know,
[1:06:21] he was bald, but he put he's got a full
[1:06:23] head of hair again. He's young again.
[1:06:25] Amen. Amen. He was there before he
[1:06:28] realized he was there.
[1:06:30] Hallelujah. Amen. And one day, it's not
[1:06:33] like, oh, I got to make a rapture. No.
[1:06:35] If God is in you, you have to make the
[1:06:37] rapture. Amen. You don't, you know, as I
[1:06:41] say, a sheep bears wool. It just eats
[1:06:44] grass and there's life pushing out that
[1:06:47] just makes wool. It doesn't plan it. It
[1:06:49] doesn't strategize it. It just What are
[1:06:51] you doing? I'm just being a sheep. Oh,
[1:06:54] this stuff. Yeah, it just keeps growing.
[1:06:55] I can't stop it. It's actually pretty
[1:06:58] handy sometimes when I'm cold. It's the
[1:07:00] same thing with the life of a Christian.
[1:07:02] You just walk along. This life comes out
[1:07:05] of you. What are you doing? I'm just
[1:07:07] being me. I don't know. I can't help it.
[1:07:08] Oh, that. Yeah, it's just how it is.
[1:07:11] Amen. because another life is there.
[1:07:14] You can't help it. Amen. And then now if
[1:07:17] you grieve the Holy Ghost, you know
[1:07:19] something's wrong and he doesn't leave
[1:07:20] you in that state very long and you
[1:07:22] repent of it, then he comes back down
[1:07:23] again and you just keep walking on.
[1:07:26] Remember, you're being ushered. You can
[1:07:28] be rude to your usher, but if the usher
[1:07:30] is very persuasive and very determined,
[1:07:32] that usher is going to pick you up and
[1:07:34] put you where you're going to be.
[1:07:36] Hallelujah. Amen. She can come kicking
[1:07:38] and screaming, or you can just come
[1:07:40] happy. You're going to end up in the
[1:07:41] seat. Thank you, Lord. Amen. It's the
[1:07:45] same thing with us. You can come happy
[1:07:48] or you can come tired and worn out.
[1:07:52] Hallelujah. The end result will still be
[1:07:54] the same.
[1:07:56] Amen. Oh, that means I don't need to do
[1:07:58] anything. No. God is a gentleman. And
[1:08:01] I'm going to I'm going to finish with
[1:08:02] this. God is a gentleman. So, he doesn't
[1:08:05] take anything from you without you first
[1:08:07] giving it to him. Amen. So he's not
[1:08:10] going to take your life and make him
[1:08:12] yours and the unless you say, "Here it
[1:08:14] is, Lord." That's right. He doesn't just
[1:08:16] pick you up and shake you and twist you
[1:08:17] and now you're a believer. You have to
[1:08:20] say, "Here's my life.
[1:08:22] Oh, I have this thing I can't overcome.
[1:08:24] Oh Lord, take it from me." You have to
[1:08:26] give it to him.
[1:08:28] If you don't, you can you can jump up
[1:08:29] and down and everything you want to do,
[1:08:31] but if you just got to give it to him.
[1:08:33] You just got to first you have to, oh,
[1:08:35] when he meets me, then I'll give up all
[1:08:37] these things. You have to give it to him
[1:08:39] first and then he you know it's like if
[1:08:43] you could not take this off me but I
[1:08:45] want to give this to you but but you
[1:08:47] can't get out of my grasp. Well, you
[1:08:48] can't. I can't give it to you. But when
[1:08:50] I say here you go. There it is. Amen. So
[1:08:54] it's not like you just got to sit around
[1:08:55] and say, "Well, when he meets me then
[1:08:57] I'll be a Christian." No, you have to
[1:08:58] give your life. You give it first and
[1:09:01] then he comes and takes it and makes it
[1:09:02] his.
[1:09:04] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:08] Amen. Let's just Can we just stand?
[1:09:10] Let's just sing. We're looking for a
[1:09:12] city where we'll never die.
[1:09:16] Hallelujah. Remember Joseph?
[1:09:18] Okay. People say, "Why is my life going
[1:09:21] bad if I'm meant to be a believer? I'm
[1:09:22] victorious." All these things. Remember
[1:09:24] Joseph was being ushered to the right
[1:09:27] hand of Pharaoh. Well, how was he being
[1:09:29] ushered? He was sold into slavery by his
[1:09:31] brothers. Amen. He was tied up and taken
[1:09:34] down into Egypt. He was being ushered.
[1:09:37] Amen. Then he was in Potifer's house.
[1:09:39] Then he got accused. He's back in jail.
[1:09:41] He's you put in jail. He was being
[1:09:43] ushered. Amen. And then the butler and
[1:09:45] the baker were there and the butler
[1:09:47] forgot about for two years. He was being
[1:09:48] ushered. The the time and season had to
[1:09:51] be right and he had to be right. Amen.
[1:09:54] And then
[1:09:56] finally, let's go. But the whole the
[1:09:59] whole thing, it began when he had those
[1:10:01] dreams.
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:04] It's not, you know, it's not just
[1:10:06] suddenly, oh, now the Lord's leading me
[1:10:07] on to the rapture. No, when he first
[1:10:09] begins to call you. Amen. The ushering
[1:10:13] in is going on.
[1:10:15] Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] Amen. Let's just sing
[1:10:19] this. Here among the shadows living in a
[1:10:24] lonely
[1:10:26] land, the pilgrims on the

[1:11:35] longer speak one word of
[1:11:38] love. But surely we have found
[1:11:41] contentment. Jesus promised us a hope.
[1:11:45] So we are looking for a city built above
[1:11:49] us. Oh yes, we're
[1:11:53] looking for a

[1:12:46] love and mercy. Though we may be
[1:12:49] strangers living in this world of care,
[1:12:53] we're always looking for a city built

[1:15:10] And the voice I hear calling on my ear,
[1:15:18] the son of
[1:15:21] God is
[1:15:27] closing.
[1:15:28] And he walks with me. And he talks with
[1:15:36] me. And he tells me I am his
[1:15:44] own. And the joy we

[1:15:51] carry there.
[1:15:54] No
[1:15:56] other has
[1:15:59] ever
[1:16:02] known. He speaks and the sound of his
[1:16:09] voice is so
[1:16:12] sweet. Lovers touch their
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:17] singing and the
[1:16:21] melo that he gave to
[1:16:25] me
[1:16:27] within my
[1:16:29] heart is ringing.
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:36] And he walks with me. And he talks with
[1:16:44] me. And he tells me I am his
[1:16:52] own. And the joy we
[1:16:56] share as we
[1:16:59] carry there.
[1:17:02] No
[1:17:04] other has
[1:17:07] ever

[1:17:17] him. All the

[1:17:26] But he makes me
[1:17:29] go through the voice of wo. His voice to
[1:17:37] me is
[1:17:42] falling. And he walks with me and he
[1:17:49] talks with me.
[1:17:53] tells me I am his
[1:17:59] own. And the joy we
[1:18:04] share as we
[1:18:07] carry
[1:18:09] there no
[1:18:12] other has
[1:18:15] ever known.

[1:18:27] me and he tells me I am his
[1:18:35] own. And the joy we
[1:18:39] share as we
[1:18:42] tear there.
[1:18:46] None
[1:18:48] other has
[1:18:51] ever
[1:18:54] known. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a
[1:18:57] word of
[1:18:58] prayer. Father, truly just to hear your
[1:19:02] voice, Lord. It's so glorious to know
[1:19:05] you in this
[1:19:06] hour, Father. We're so glad we can walk
[1:19:09] with you and talk with you and not just
[1:19:12] us talking to you. You talk back to us,
[1:19:14] Lord. We're so thankful this is a love
[1:19:16] relationship between us and you, Lord.
[1:19:18] You I remember the day when you became
[1:19:22] real to me, Lord, and I fell in love
[1:19:24] with you. I thank you, Lord, that's the
[1:19:26] same now as it was back then. And Lord,
[1:19:29] we we're so glad we can go back and
[1:19:31] think upon those things and how
[1:19:33] wonderful you are. And Lord, how also
[1:19:36] you're not just a God of when, you know,
[1:19:39] back there when we first met you, but
[1:19:40] you're always walking with us. Amen.
[1:19:43] talking to us, Lord, as we walk along
[1:19:45] the way. And we want to praise your
[1:19:47] great name that we're being ushered,
[1:19:48] Lord. We're being guided, Father, from
[1:19:51] this world to the next. And Lord, we
[1:19:53] thank you. Our guide is almighty God
[1:19:56] himself. And Father, we thank you, Lord
[1:19:58] Jesus, that Lord, that your hand is upon
[1:20:01] our lives. Father, it's nothing in
[1:20:03] ourselves that is special, Lord, of our
[1:20:05] own humanity. Lord, it's just you called
[1:20:07] us. Thank you, Father. And Father,
[1:20:09] that's the main thing, Lord. I just
[1:20:12] pray, oh God, that that people here who
[1:20:14] do not know what I'm talking about. They
[1:20:16] may think it's a bit strange, Father.
[1:20:18] May you make yourself real to them.
[1:20:21] Lord, may they not just look in and say,
[1:20:22] "These people are a bit crazy or a bit
[1:20:24] religious, but Father, may they see
[1:20:26] you're a living God today." Amen. May
[1:20:28] you grant it, Almighty God. We thank
[1:20:30] you, Lord, that you're ushering us into
[1:20:33] that wedding supper feast, and you have
[1:20:35] made us, Lord, you've allowed us to make
[1:20:37] ourselves ready by what you've given to
[1:20:39] us, Lord. Father, that we are robed in
[1:20:41] your righteousness because you have
[1:20:43] given us your righteousness, Lord, by
[1:20:45] the blood you shed on Calvary, we can be
[1:20:47] as righteous as you are righteous. And
[1:20:49] we thank you, Lord, that even now, Lord,
[1:20:52] Father, that you w you have washed all
[1:20:54] our sins away, Father, that you're
[1:20:56] making us and molding us into your
[1:20:57] image. And Lord, should our should
[1:21:00] should our lives leave leave these
[1:21:03] bodies, Lord, we'll go straight to be
[1:21:05] with you. Thank you, Lord. We thank you
[1:21:06] for that great assurance, Lord. We're
[1:21:08] not scared of where we're going because
[1:21:10] you put assurance in our hearts, Lord.
[1:21:13] Father, that just beyond the veil,
[1:21:14] you're waiting for us there. And Lord,
[1:21:17] may you just bless each one here.
[1:21:19] Father, be with us as we drive. Lord,
[1:21:22] keep us, Lord, guide us throughout
[1:21:24] tomorrow and the next day and the next
[1:21:26] day, Lord, till we see each other again.
[1:21:28] And Father, just bless each one who
[1:21:30] streamed in as well, oh God. Father, and
[1:21:33] those who are not here, Lord, we just
[1:21:34] commit the service into your hands. And
[1:21:36] we love you with all our heart, Lord. We
[1:21:38] thank you for your goodness. Lord, we
[1:21:40] can't, Lord. We can never, Lord, just
[1:21:42] get over how great you are to us, Lord.
[1:21:45] Every day we just rejoice and praise you
[1:21:47] more, Lord. How great you are. And
[1:21:49] Father, you Lord Lord, we're so glad you
[1:21:51] never become common, Father. And may you
[1:21:54] may you never become common to us, Lord.
[1:21:56] May we just love you more and just be in
[1:21:58] awe of what you've done, Father, because
[1:22:00] it's not our will. It's not him that
[1:22:02] willth or runth, but you that give us
[1:22:03] mercy. We thank you for your great mercy
[1:22:06] upon us. Lord, we love you and thank you
[1:22:08] for this evening in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:22:10] Dismiss us with your blessing now,
[1:22:11] please, Lord. Amen.
[1:22:15] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] Amen. God bless you, friends. Amen.
