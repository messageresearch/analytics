[2:15] [Music]
[2:57] God bless you all. Welcome to church
[2:59] this
[3:00] evening. Amen. Good to be here. Good to
[3:03] have the sound
[3:04] [Music]
[3:06] back. How are you all doing? Ready to
[3:08] praise the Lord? You feeling
[3:12] good? Someone posted about the pope past
[3:15] dying. And I think it was just a
[3:17] muggy. Yeah. And
[3:20] um they got different news articles on
[3:22] them. Now, this isn't I guess this isn't
[3:25] it's not really funny, but No, it's not
[3:28] funny at all.
[3:30] It's interesting
[3:33] how these things are taken from a a
[3:37] Catholic point of view because I
[3:41] um saw a news
[3:43] article about the pope which you
[3:49] would suspect should have had a glorious
[3:53] leaving from this world to the next, you
[3:55] know, if you looked at it that way. and
[3:57] you know that the Lord's there to meet
[3:59] him and those sorts of things. That's
[4:00] that's the way that a a Christian should
[4:03] pass over. You know, it's a peaceful
[4:04] experience when you pass from this world
[4:05] to the next, the Lord's waiting there to
[4:07] carry you across. And um Brother Brandon
[4:10] would often reference, you know, people
[4:12] that weren't saved or they thought they
[4:14] were and they weren't. at the end think
[4:16] they would see horrible things and they
[4:17] would realize that, you know, they they
[4:19] were lost and they would have a
[4:21] different experience than what a a born
[4:24] again believer should have when
[4:26] they come to the river. Um, and I read a
[4:31] there was a news article and it said
[4:32] that maybe it was the night before he
[4:35] passed away. It said he had to be
[4:37] sedated
[4:38] because he was screaming, "Get these
[4:42] evil, I use a swear word, but
[4:44] illegitimates off
[4:45] me." Meaning all these demons. And it
[4:48] says, they said, "As a portal to hell
[4:49] opened up at the end of his
[4:51] bed, you know, so that I don't think
[4:54] they're realizing that those things are
[4:56] there to get to take him to his final
[4:58] resting place, you know." So they sedate
[5:00] the guy so he can't to to stop the
[5:03] torment happening.
[5:05] But it's a vastly different experience
[5:08] than I think what
[5:10] Paul experienced when he passed on. He
[5:12] said, "Lord, I've I've fought a good
[5:14] fight. I've kept the faith. Now, Lord,
[5:15] receive
[5:16] me." And and I guess
[5:19] yeah, it people can it gets serious when
[5:23] we at the end of our road. I've always
[5:25] thought that, you know, I think I try
[5:26] and keep myself sober in times and
[5:28] think, Lord, imagine myself being at the
[5:30] end of the road and how would I think
[5:31] there and I want to think like that now.
[5:33] You know, that's how we think soberly
[5:36] cuz cuz the Bible tells us to to think
[5:38] soberly. You know, we can get carried
[5:39] away in life and and almost detach
[5:42] ourselves from a lot of things, but we
[5:43] we've got to think soberly. And I think,
[5:45] Lord, okay, well, the soberest I'll
[5:46] probably ever be is when I'm at that
[5:48] point where I'm going to cross from this
[5:50] world to the next, that's the time where
[5:52] everything there's only one thing that
[5:54] matters there. All the other lot a lot
[5:55] of things won't matter there. You know,
[5:58] there many many things will not matter
[5:59] at all there. And I think Lord, I want
[6:02] to I want to keep focus on the things
[6:03] that will matter there. I want to keep
[6:05] focused of them when I'm here like
[6:06] living now. That's what I want to focus
[6:08] on here and make sure that I keep those
[6:10] things. So yeah, I don't know why I said
[6:12] that, but it was just it struck me when
[6:14] I read that statement, you know. Um
[6:17] let's stand tonight and we'll just
[6:19] commit the service to the Lord. And I
[6:20] believe we're in for a good time. I
[6:21] always appreciate um Brother Jimmy's
[6:24] ministry and I do believe he has a
[6:25] ministry. I believe he's got a gift. So,
[6:28] we're in for a if we will pull on that,
[6:31] the Lord will speak to us um this
[6:33] evening. Let's just pray. Heavenly
[6:34] Father, we thank you that we can be
[6:36] here, Lord. And we thank you that we
[6:38] know you, Lord, and we know you in the
[6:40] power of your resurrection, Lord, that
[6:42] when we come to that place to cross from
[6:43] this world to the next, we know, Lord,
[6:46] that the there'll be the angels
[6:47] surrounding us, Lord, and you'll be
[6:48] there to meet us, Lord Jesus.
[6:51] And we just thank you Lord that we have
[6:52] this blessed hope Lord and the the great
[6:55] presence your spirit that we feel Lord
[6:57] when we come and worship you and that we
[6:58] we feel inside of us is the same
[7:00] presence that's going to meet us Lord on
[7:02] that day Lord when we draw our final
[7:03] breath Lord if the we should go before
[7:06] the rapture Lord that you'll meet us
[7:08] there I'm glad we don't have to have
[7:10] this May that not be true Lord what that
[7:12] pope went through there Lord we don't we
[7:15] don't desire that anyone would perish
[7:17] Lord that but that all would have
[7:19] everlasting life, Lord. If there's
[7:21] anything in us that would be happy,
[7:22] Lord, to see a just a human being, Lord,
[7:25] go through any sort of misery, then we
[7:26] have the wrong spirit about us. But
[7:28] Lord, we also know that that when time's
[7:30] up, we can't pray for that person
[7:32] anymore. Lord, it's it's been done. So,
[7:34] we thank you for this time tonight that
[7:35] we can, Lord, come to you while we're
[7:37] living, while we've got breath, while
[7:38] we've got hope, and we can worship you,
[7:39] Lord Jesus. So, we just want to worship
[7:41] you tonight. May you bless the songs and
[7:42] bless the um ministry tonight. We just
[7:44] want to um draw on your gift, Lord, that
[7:47] you have placed amongst us and bless the
[7:49] brethren that couldn't come tonight,
[7:50] too. We just pray in Jesus wonderful
[7:51] name. Amen. Praise the Lord. The first
[7:54] song we're going to sing is, "Oh, yes.
[7:55] We're looking for a
[7:57] city." We'll start with the chorus. Am I
[7:59] really loud or is that just Am I loud?
[8:03] I know, man. I'm like echoing in the
[8:05] whole building. Maybe just down a couple
[8:07] of notches, bro.
[8:10] It's all quite nice hearing your voice
[8:11] really loud, but it's after a while
[8:13] you're like,
[8:15] man, it's like when when you song lead
[8:17] and preach, not going to lie to you, by
[8:19] the time the song leading finished,
[8:20] you're tired of hearing the sound of
[8:22] your own voice and then you got to
[8:23] preach for another
[8:24] hour. Don't like doing that. Oh yes,
[8:27] we're
[8:28] looking for a
[8:31] city
[8:33] where we'll never die.
[8:38] Never the
[8:42] same.
[8:43] Never say
[8:47] goodbye.

[10:03] spir come all our hopes
[10:10] renew. Here in disappointment often we
[10:14] so sadly roam and earthly friends no
[10:17] longer speak one word of

[10:22] contentment Jesus promised us. We are
[10:26] looking for a city built above. Oh yes,

[26:52] Thank you, musicians.
[26:57] Well, it's good to be back. God bless
[26:59] you, saints.
[27:02] Man, I need to say in everyone's else
[27:05] behalf was an awesome camp. I hope that
[27:08] you could have um stream it. Was
[27:11] beautiful, was very powerful, very
[27:13] gladful being able to be there. Let's
[27:16] open our Bibles in the book of um
[27:18] Numbers chapter
[27:22] 14 and from the verse one we're going to
[27:25] start
[27:38] reading. And the Bible says, "And all
[27:42] the congregation lifted up their voice
[27:44] and cried. And the people wept that
[27:47] night, and all the children of
[27:50] Israel, murmur, murmured, whatever,
[27:53] sorry, against Moses and against Aaron."
[27:57] And the whole congregation said unto
[27:58] them, "Will God that we had died in the
[28:01] land of Egypt? Or will God we had died
[28:04] in the wilderness? And wherefore had the
[28:07] Lord brought
[28:08] us unto this land to fall by the sword
[28:12] that our wives and our children should
[28:15] be a prey, where it not be better for us
[28:18] to return into Egypt. You may be
[28:22] seated. Want to welcome sister
[28:31] Rachel. Amen. So let's talk about this.
[28:35] a murmuring and
[28:39] whining spirit. This message was um
[28:43] chosen by Bella as on Monday. No. Yeah,
[28:48] I think it was Monday. We were in
[28:49] Taranga and Tony's in Sharon's house and
[28:52] I was like, man, I'm preaching on
[28:54] Wednesday and I need something to preach
[28:56] about and she came with a little book
[28:58] and she said, "This one, daddy." So,
[29:01] this is on Bella's behalf. So if you
[29:04] don't like it, you can talk to
[29:07] her. So just let's go back a little bit
[29:10] in the um in the
[29:12] story. Moses, he sended 12 spies to go
[29:16] and see the land. And and we know that
[29:19] 10 of them, they came back with a bad
[29:22] report. It was too difficult. The people
[29:25] was way too strong, way too big, way too
[29:28] powerful. They had wolves, they had
[29:30] warriors. It was impossible.
[29:33] But two of them they came back with a
[29:35] different report. There was a different
[29:38] spirit in them. They came back saying it
[29:41] is doable. We can do it. They remember
[29:45] the Lord that split the sea. They
[29:48] remember the plagues. They remember the
[29:50] power of God. But 10 of
[29:52] them they couldn't remember
[29:55] that. You can see that guy saying, "Man,
[29:58] they're like this tall. They're
[30:00] humongous. They're warriors. We are like
[30:04] grasshoppers. We are nothing.
[30:07] [Music]
[30:08] So the people of Israel says, "And they
[30:12] said one unto another, let us make a
[30:14] captain and let us return into Egypt."
[30:18] They wanted to return because they said,
[30:20] "Man, this is not good." In their
[30:23] hearts, they were still in Egypt. We we
[30:25] will see soon. and says, "Then Moses and
[30:28] Aaron fell on their faces before all the
[30:30] assembly of the congregation of the
[30:32] children of
[30:34] Israel." If we go back to numbers um
[30:37] 11, we'll see that Egypt was was still
[30:42] in their hearts.
[30:44] And
[30:45] says, "And the mixed multitude multitude
[30:48] that was among them fall
[30:51] uplasting. And the children of Israel
[30:53] also wept again and said, "Who shall
[30:56] give us flesh to eat? We remember the
[30:59] fish which we did eat in Egypt freely,
[31:03] the cucumbers and the melons and the
[31:05] leaks and the onions and the garlic. But
[31:08] now our soul is dried away. There's
[31:10] nothing at all beside this mana that
[31:13] comes from heaven and is a heavenly food
[31:16] before our eyes. There's just nothing.
[31:19] We just have this mana. We just have
[31:21] this blessing that comes from heaven
[31:24] every single
[31:25] day. But they were not
[31:31] grateful. They forgot about this. They
[31:35] forgot that they were slaves for 400
[31:39] years. They forgot the whips. They
[31:41] forgot all of that, the whips and
[31:44] everything. They just wanted to go
[31:46] back even though the Lord rescued
[31:52] them. The Bible um says, "And Joshua the
[31:55] son of Nun and Caleb the son of which
[31:59] were of them of the search the land
[32:00] rendered clothed and this spoke unto all
[32:04] the company of the children of Israel,
[32:06] saying, The land which we pass through
[32:08] to search it, it is exceeding good land.
[32:12] If the Lord delight in us, then we will
[32:14] bring us to us the land and give it to
[32:17] us a land which flowth the milk and
[32:20] honey. Only rebel not ye against the
[32:23] Lord, neither fear ye the people of the
[32:26] land, for they are bread, they're bread
[32:29] for us, man. Easy peasy. These guys are
[32:32] nothing for us. We have the Lord with
[32:34] us.
[32:35] Their defense is departed from them and
[32:38] the Lord is with us. Fear them not. And
[32:42] all the congregation said, "Amen. We're
[32:44] gonna go and take the
[32:47] land." And all the congregation bed
[32:50] stone them with stones. And the glory of
[32:53] the Lord appear in the tabernacle of the
[32:55] congregation before all the children of
[32:58] Israel. They couldn't believe it. And
[33:00] that's something that always amazed me
[33:02] because probably there was only like a
[33:04] couple of months or weeks since the the
[33:07] Red Sea was split in half. But they
[33:10] couldn't not remember that. They just
[33:12] like the 10 plagues and everything. And
[33:15] they were too scared of the people that
[33:18] were living in the promised land. They
[33:20] forgot about all this. The 10 plagues of
[33:24] blood, the frogs, the lies, flies,
[33:26] pestilence, boils, hail stom, locus,
[33:29] darkness, the death of the
[33:32] frisborn. They could not remember. They
[33:35] diminish the power of God because
[33:38] because it was too
[33:40] hard. And now we have Moses just
[33:43] standing in the gap. This is remarkable.
[33:46] This is man awesome. And you can see
[33:49] here the leadership. God always put a
[33:53] leader, a pastor. And I think it's very
[33:57] important that we respect the leadership
[34:00] there is in church. pastors, deacons,
[34:03] stone leaders, they are there for a
[34:05] reason. And we'll see that the children
[34:09] of Israel, they
[34:12] were they were like um well, the word is
[34:17] not condemned, but it doesn't come to me
[34:18] now to go in the desert for 40 years
[34:22] because they kept like murmuring. They
[34:25] kept just
[34:27] winging. They could not just rest that
[34:32] the Lord was going to deliver them. They
[34:34] just could not. They had to
[34:38] complain. There's going to be a little
[34:40] bit of reading tonight.
[34:44] And English is not my mother tongue. So,
[34:49] Brother Colin, can you see the the
[34:51] scriptures there or should I pick
[34:53] another one?
[34:56] And if you get tired, just give the
[34:57] microphone to brother. Hey Isaac, you
[35:00] have a microphone
[35:04] today. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[35:07] "How long will this people provoke me?
[35:10] And how long will it be if they believe
[35:14] me? for all the signs which I have
[35:17] showed among them. I will smite them
[35:20] with pestilence and
[35:23] disinherit them and will make of thee a
[35:27] great a nation and mightier than they.
[35:31] And Moses said unto the Lord, then the
[35:34] Egyptians shall hear it, for thou
[35:38] broughtest up this people in thine might
[35:42] from among them. Brother Brandham said
[35:44] that Moses stood there in the gap
[35:47] because he was anointing as Christ. He
[35:50] was going to stand there and he was
[35:52] going to intercede for the people,
[35:59] right? And they will tell it to the
[36:04] inhabitants of this land. For they have
[36:07] heard that thou thou Lord art among the
[36:11] people. that thou, Lord, art seen face
[36:14] to face, and that thy cloud standeth
[36:17] over them, and that thou goest before
[36:21] them by day, and by and in a pillar of
[36:25] cloud, and in the pillar of fire by
[36:28] night. Now if thou shalt kill all this
[36:31] people as one man, then the nations will
[36:36] have heard the fame of thee will speak,
[36:40] saying, Because the Lord was not able to
[36:43] bring this people into the land which he
[36:47] sworeth unto them, therefore he hath
[36:49] slain them in the wilderness.
[36:54] You can see the way that Moses is
[36:58] talking to God and he's telling
[37:01] him to don't do it because God promised
[37:05] to
[37:07] them. Now, if I if that would have been
[37:10] me, I would have say yes,
[37:12] Lord, kill them
[37:15] all. That's why Moses were chosen and
[37:18] not
[37:19] me. That's why we have a pastor. That's
[37:22] why we have leadership in the church and
[37:25] you can say, "Oh, I could done it
[37:28] better. I could do it
[37:30] better." But it is in that moment when
[37:33] you see why that man was chosen because
[37:36] you can see the heart of Moses
[37:41] and carry
[37:42] on. And now I bi beseech thee, let the
[37:46] power of my Lord be greater, according
[37:49] as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is
[37:53] long-suffering and of great mercy,
[37:56] forgiving iniquity and transgressions,
[37:58] and by no means clearing the guilty,
[38:01] visiting the iniquities of the fathers
[38:03] upon the children unto the third and
[38:06] fourth generation. Pardon, I beseech
[38:08] thee, the iniquity of the people
[38:10] according unto the greatness of thy
[38:13] mercy. And as thou hast forgiven this
[38:17] people from Egypt, even until now. And
[38:21] the Lord said, I have pardoned according
[38:24] to thy
[38:25] word. Amen.
[38:28] But as truly as I live, all the earth
[38:30] shall be filled with the glory of the
[38:32] Lord. Because all those men which have
[38:34] seen my glory and my miracles, which I
[38:37] did in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and
[38:41] have tempted me now, these 10 times, and
[38:45] have not hearkened to my voice, surely
[38:49] they shall not see the land which I saw
[38:51] unto their fathers, neither shall any of
[38:54] them that provoked me see it. But my
[38:58] servant Caleb, because he had another
[39:02] spirit with him, and had followed me
[39:05] fully, him will I bring into the land
[39:09] where into he went, and his seed shall
[39:12] possess it. The Bible saying that Caleb,
[39:15] he had another
[39:16] spirit. I can't say what kind of spirit
[39:19] was, but if everyone was murmuring, he
[39:23] wasn't. So, he was he had a grateful
[39:26] heart. He was thankful with the Lord. He
[39:29] remembered the power of the Lord. And
[39:31] that was that different
[39:35] spirit. And is it this the same one? No.
[39:39] And now I beseech thee, let the power of
[39:42] my law be great according as thou hast
[39:44] spoken, saying, The Lord is
[39:47] longsuffering and of great mercy,
[39:49] forgiving iniquity and transgression,
[39:51] and by no means clearing the guilt, the
[39:53] guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
[39:56] fathers, upon the children, unto the
[39:58] third and fourth generation. Pardon, I
[40:01] beseech thee, the iniquity of this
[40:04] people, according unto the greatness of
[40:06] thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven
[40:09] this people from Egypt, even until now.
[40:12] And the Lord said, I have pardoned
[40:15] according to thy
[40:17] word. Told you it's going to be a little
[40:19] bit of reading. And the Lord spoke unto
[40:22] Moses and unto Aaron, saying, How long
[40:25] shall I bear with this evil congregation
[40:28] which murmur against me? I have heard
[40:31] the murmuring of the children of Israel,
[40:34] which they murmur against me. Say unto
[40:37] them, As truly as I live, sayith the
[40:39] Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so
[40:42] will I do it to you. Your carcasses
[40:45] shall fall in this wilderness and all
[40:47] that were number of you according to
[40:49] your whole number from 20 years old and
[40:53] upwards which have memory against me.
[40:57] The Lord had enough of that thing.
[41:02] So if I can put the ceremony in
[41:05] one phrase
[41:07] is stop murmuring.
[41:10] Probably this ceremony is for no one
[41:11] that's here. probably for someone that's
[41:13] watching online or
[41:16] something. But if if this sermon helps
[41:20] one person, that's awesome.
[41:27] Doubtless, ye shall not come into the
[41:30] land concerning which swore to make you
[41:32] dwell therein, save Caleb, the son of
[41:36] um and Joshua the son of Nun. But your
[41:40] little ones which ye said should be a
[41:42] prey them will I bring him and they
[41:46] shall know the land which ye have
[41:48] despised. But as for you your carcasses
[41:52] they shall fall in the wilderness and
[41:54] your ch and your children shall wander
[41:58] in the wilderness 40 years and bear your
[42:01] widows until your carcasses be wasted in
[42:05] the wilderness.
[42:07] After the numbers of the days in which
[42:09] ye search the land, even 40 days, each
[42:13] day for a year shall ye bear your
[42:17] iniquities, even 40 years, even 40
[42:21] years, and ye shall know my breach of
[42:24] promise. And I, the Lord have said, I
[42:28] will surely do it unto all this evil
[42:30] congregation that are gathered together
[42:33] against me in the wilderness. they shall
[42:35] be consumed and there they shall die.
[42:39] And the men which Moses sent to siege
[42:41] the land who returned and made all the
[42:43] congregation to murmur against him by
[42:47] bringing him up slander upon the land.
[42:49] Even those men did bring him upon the
[42:52] evil report upon the land die by the
[42:54] plague before the Lord. But Joshua the
[42:57] son of Nun and Caleb the son of which I
[43:00] wear of the men that went to search the
[43:02] land lived still.
[43:07] Now mirroring is a devil
[43:11] music because that kind that can cause
[43:15] a split between us the congregation that
[43:21] can cause a bridge like something that
[43:24] is between you and me because now we're
[43:28] memoring and that's not good. We have
[43:32] this guy that he wants to row his boat,
[43:35] but he is
[43:38] still there's a there's a stick there
[43:41] and there's a rope. So that guy, even if
[43:44] he pulls hard, he's going to be there
[43:46] forever.
[43:49] Amen. Like the people that left
[43:53] Egypt, their hearts were still bound to
[43:56] Egypt. They could not let go. There were
[44:00] slaves in Egypt, but they didn't want to
[44:02] go. That's the same when you don't want
[44:04] to let go the
[44:07] world. We have been
[44:09] chosen to move
[44:11] forward. But if you are still holding
[44:14] the world, we are not going to move. Now
[44:18] murmuring can cause that problem too.
[44:21] Now we have double the power.
[44:25] But what are we doing if we are pulling
[44:27] from different sides? We are not going
[44:29] to go
[44:31] anywhere. And you can pull as hard as
[44:33] you can, but if the other guy is pulling
[44:36] in the wrong direction, you are not
[44:38] moving. You're going to get tired. And
[44:40] we are not going
[44:42] anywhere. Now, this is how it's supposed
[44:44] to
[44:46] be. Beautiful day. We are all pulling to
[44:49] the same side. Amen.
[44:54] Now, if you have a mirroring in the
[44:56] desert
[44:58] experience, am I pronouncing that word
[45:00] wrong? A that's why you guys are
[45:02] laughing. E
[45:03] how you say it? Am I doing good? Good.
[45:07] Okay, you
[45:10] too. We'll see outside. E,
[45:14] if you have that
[45:17] experience, my recommendation is to
[45:20] stop.
[45:21] So you see what happened to the people
[45:23] of Israel in the
[45:26] desert. First Corinthians says um
[45:29] moreover brethren I will not that ye
[45:32] should be ignorant or have all your
[45:35] fathers were under the cloud and all
[45:38] passed through the sea and were all
[45:40] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[45:42] the sea? And did all eat the same
[45:44] spiritual meat? And did all drink the
[45:47] same spiritual drink? For they drank of
[45:49] the spiritual rock that followed them,
[45:51] and the rock was Christ, but with many
[45:55] of them was not well pleased. For were
[45:58] overthrown in the wilderness. Now these
[46:00] things were our example to the intent we
[46:03] shall not be we should not last after
[46:06] evil things as they also lasted. Neither
[46:09] be ye idolattors of where some of them,
[46:12] as it is written, the people sat down
[46:14] and eat and drink and rose up to play.
[46:17] Neither let us commit fornication, and
[46:19] some of them committed and fell in one
[46:22] day three and
[46:24] 20,000. Neither let us tempt Christ, as
[46:27] some of them also tempted and were
[46:29] destroy of serpents. Neither memory ye.
[46:33] So some of them also murmured and were
[46:36] destroy of the destroyer. Now all these
[46:39] things happened unto them for
[46:42] example and they were reasoning for our
[46:46] for our admonition upon whom the end of
[46:49] the world are come.
[46:52] They went through that thing for you and
[46:54] me. So we can see what happened to them
[46:57] and
[46:58] say oh man this is what happened to
[47:01] them. Probably you shouldn't do it.
[47:06] The Bible says only one part that that
[47:09] memory was
[47:11] right and we can find that in the book
[47:14] of acts and
[47:16] says and in those days where the numbers
[47:19] of the disciples was multiplied there
[47:22] arose a murmuring of the greians against
[47:25] the Hebrews because their widowed were
[47:27] neglected in the daily ministration.
[47:30] Then the twel called the multitude and
[47:32] of the disciples unto them and said, "It
[47:35] is not reason that we should leave the
[47:37] word of God and serve tables. Wherefore,
[47:40] brethren, look ye out among you seven
[47:44] men of honest report fully of the Holy
[47:46] Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint
[47:49] over this business.
[47:52] But we will give ourselves continually
[47:54] to prayer and the and to the ministry of
[47:56] the word and the saying please the whole
[48:00] multitude. There was a need. There was
[48:02] an actual
[48:03] need and was answer and everyone was
[48:08] happy.
[48:10] Now we know people that are quite
[48:14] ungrateful. I'm not looking everyone. I
[48:16] have to look people and there's some
[48:17] people that I really like. That's why I
[48:19] look Jenny all the time.
[48:23] But there are some people there
[48:24] ungrateful people. Now I'm going to show
[48:26] you some conditions of life like a 100
[48:28] years
[48:30] ago. That's daddy going to work down the
[48:35] mine. You can complain about your job.
[48:38] Pretty sure it's not that
[48:41] bad. That's daddy just doing a quick and
[48:44] short job. Can you imagine how many days
[48:47] they were cutting that thing?
[48:54] Now kids from a
[48:57] school not a school. E they're workers.
[49:01] They were working at the
[49:07] mines. Do you still want that iPhone 14
[49:11] 16A? after look that condition. How can
[49:15] you say that you have a bad life because
[49:17] your mom and dad doesn't want to buy you
[49:20] something? You can say to me, "Oh, but
[49:23] that's like a 100 years ago." Well, that
[49:26] looked more
[49:27] recent. Still the same thing. You should
[49:31] be so grateful for living in the
[49:34] condition that you live
[49:38] in. Keep working.
[49:46] That can be Bella or Ezekiel. Look the
[49:48] condition that the world is going
[49:51] through. That's why we need
[49:54] Jesus. That's why we need him to change
[49:56] this world.
[50:02] Philippians says, "Do all things without
[50:04] murmuring and disputings, that ye may be
[50:07] blameless and harmless, the son of God
[50:10] without rebuke, in the midst of a
[50:12] crooked, impervious nation among who yay
[50:16] shine as light in the world, holding
[50:19] forth the word of life, that I may
[50:21] rejoice in the day of Christ, that I
[50:23] have not run in vain, neither labored in
[50:26] vain."
[50:29] wanted to write this. Why do people have
[50:32] complexes? Because that's a big reason
[50:35] why some people they like to complain
[50:36] and winge
[50:38] and memor again. One of the cause causes
[50:42] is um an infury complex occurs when the
[50:46] feelings of infur are intensified in the
[50:49] individual through discouragement or
[50:52] failure. Those who are at risk of the
[50:56] developing a complex include people who
[50:58] show signs of a low self-esteem and a
[51:01] self-worth and have low status in their
[51:05] peer
[51:09] group. I'm too fat. I'm too short. I'm
[51:14] too skinny. I'm too white. I'm too
[51:18] brown. That's something that always
[51:20] happened. I like girls that have
[51:22] straight hair. They want to have Kelly
[51:23] here. People that are tall, they don't
[51:25] want to be that tall. People that are
[51:26] sure, they want to be, you know, they
[51:30] say why we just don't be happy with who
[51:35] we
[51:36] are.
[51:40] Now, that
[51:42] house, it's my dream
[51:45] house. The house that I'm living now, it
[51:47] doesn't look like that one. I don't have
[51:48] a lake outside my house.
[51:53] I only need a roof, a bed, and food to
[51:57] eat. And with that, I'm more than
[52:00] happy. If one day I get that house, I'm
[52:04] going to be very happy. Do I need
[52:06] it? I don't need it. That's a dream. And
[52:11] that
[52:11] one, that one is my drinker.
[52:15] Maybe I'm never going to have
[52:17] it, but that's my dream
[52:20] car. Do I need it? I only need a car to
[52:24] move me from p from A to
[52:28] B. That's fleshy
[52:31] fleshy. If one day have
[52:33] it, that going to be very cool. But if I
[52:36] never have it, I'm still going to be
[52:38] happy with the Lord.
[52:45] Now, I'm going to tell you a
[52:52] secret. I'm a short
[52:55] person.
[52:57] I'm I'm 163, which is like 5 nothing or
[53:03] 5.4 something like that. 55
[53:09] 54. We stop there.
[53:13] Now I was even short in Chile because um
[53:16] like the how do you call this thing?
[53:18] Like the average height is like
[53:20] 1.7 was short. When I move
[53:23] here that average probably is like 1.8.
[53:26] The old guys taller than
[53:29] me. Some of the kids are still not but
[53:33] they're going to pass soon. So when I
[53:36] moved here, I mean, let's when I was in
[53:40] high school, I was, you know, all my
[53:42] friends, they started to grow, but I
[53:44] didn't grow. I just stay the same
[53:47] height. And for like two weeks, I felt
[53:50] like, man, I want to be
[53:53] short. But I was like, okay, I'm going
[53:56] to be the short guy. That's
[53:58] fine. It never happened more than that.
[54:01] I didn't allow the devil to like give me
[54:04] like a complex or something like that.
[54:06] That's why I can joke with it. I don't
[54:09] mind. We always joke with our mind like
[54:11] it's just
[54:12] funny. But when I moved here again
[54:15] because all the people are more tall. I
[54:18] was like, man, I'm short again.
[54:21] E. And I was staying with uh at Pedro's
[54:24] house and he used to have chickens and
[54:27] turkeys and he used to feed them really
[54:29] good. So there were fat chicken and fat
[54:31] turkeys. And one day I was looking
[54:34] outside the window and I was like, "Man,
[54:36] I'm feeling short
[54:38] again." I was looking outside. There was
[54:41] this big
[54:42] beards and that black beard. It came to
[54:46] the scene and he just flew in between
[54:49] the chicken and the turkey and stood
[54:53] there carry on flying. Went flying and
[54:57] just disappeared.
[54:59] Now probably this for you it's nothing
[55:01] but I know that God hides in
[55:04] simplicity for me that moment oh boy
[55:08] that was a revelation for me. It was
[55:09] like you know Jimmy there might be some
[55:12] people that are very tall but that
[55:14] little black beard that one can fly and
[55:18] I was like yeah one day I'm going to
[55:21] fly. One day I'm going to get out of
[55:24] here. There might be people that are
[55:25] very tall, they're very
[55:27] big, but they're not going to fly. With
[55:31] that revelation in my heart, now I can
[55:33] joke, you know me, I don't mind if you
[55:36] call me
[55:37] short. And every time I remember that
[55:41] moment
[55:43] now, that could have created a complex
[55:46] in my life because I'm
[55:49] short and I don't want to be seen. And I
[55:52] start hiding.
[55:54] today. But thanks to the Lord, he gave
[55:56] me a grateful
[55:58] heart. So probably this thought wasn't
[56:02] for anyone
[56:05] here.
[56:07] But let's not be ungrateful with what
[56:10] the Lord has given to
[56:13] us. Even the smallest thing, there are
[56:16] some people that they don't have it.
[56:18] There are people living in horrible
[56:22] conditions and we can think that we
[56:24] deserve better but what we have is what
[56:27] the Lord has given to us and he knows
[56:31] way better than us what we can hold. You
[56:35] know probably if the Lord give it too
[56:37] much probably we're going to think that
[56:39] we're at the big thing and and even stop
[56:43] going to church.
[56:46] There are some people that they have
[56:49] plenty of
[56:50] houses and I'm so happy for them. I
[56:54] don't have none. Why should I complain
[56:56] that they have more than one house and I
[56:58] don't have any? That's what the Lord
[57:01] give it to them. Brother Empo has a
[57:04] really big car, a beautiful
[57:07] car. And I'm so happy. And every time
[57:10] that I see his car, I'm like, "Brother
[57:11] Empo, that car is so
[57:13] nice. I'm so happy for my brother. Let's
[57:17] just have the
[57:18] musician.
[57:21] But just remember if you are in that
[57:25] condition, in that murmuring in the
[57:28] desert
[57:31] experience, we should stop that because
[57:34] that can cause a division in the
[57:39] fellowship and that is going to put us
[57:41] in a place like this.
[57:44] where we want to pull to one side, the
[57:46] other one want to pull to the other side
[57:48] and we are not going to get
[57:51] anywhere. So let's just stand this
[57:54] night. Let's just
[58:00] pray. Almighty God, we want to give you
[58:02] thanks for all the things that you gave
[58:04] us, Lord. Thank you,
[58:07] Lord, for the bed that we have and the
[58:10] roof on top of our heads, Lord.
[58:13] Thank you Lord for the food that we
[58:15] have. Thank you Lord for the fellowship
[58:17] that we have Lord. Thank you for this
[58:21] church. Thank you Lord for all your
[58:23] blessings. Thank you Lord for our
[58:25] daughters and our boys Lord. Thank you

[58:29] youth. Thank you Lord for the elders
[58:33] Lord in this place. Thank you for our
[58:35] pastor. Thank you for our deacons Lord.
[58:38] Thank you for the preachers. Thank you
[58:40] for our sisters. Thank you for our
[58:42] brothers,
[58:43] Lord. We want to be thankful. We want to
[58:46] have a thankful heart, Lord, that we can
[58:49] go into places and carry a joyful face,
[58:53] Lord, because we
[58:56] are the
[58:58] children of the king. Lord,
[59:02] we want to ask you, Lord, to be with
[59:05] us. And we pray, Lord, that we going to
[59:08] be with us in our way back home. Lord,
[59:10] we ask you this in Jesus Christ's name.
[59:13] Amen.

[1:00:49] your
[1:00:50] light. Thank you,
[1:00:56] Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:01] [Music]

[1:01:08] shame. You took my sickness and heal all

[1:01:13] pain. Thank you,
[1:01:19] Lord. Thank you, Lord. With a grateful
[1:01:25] heart. With a grateful

[1:01:31] praise, with an

[1:01:48] Lord. Thank you,
[1:01:52] Lord. I just want to
[1:01:55] thank you. Thank you, Lord.

[1:02:18] thank you,
[1:02:21] Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:28] I just want to
[1:02:30] thank you,
[1:02:32] [Music]
[1:02:35] Lord.
[1:02:36] Thank you,
[1:02:40] Lord. I just want to
[1:02:43] thank you,
[1:02:46] Lord. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Want to
[1:02:51] turn the meeting to you, Brother
[1:02:53] Isaac. God bless you.
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:03] Amen. Praise the
[1:03:05] Lord. You know, it's always good to be
[1:03:07] grateful and to be
[1:03:10] thankful. You know, you of you you we
[1:03:13] get in a little little situations in our
[1:03:15] life and I I think to myself, you know
[1:03:18] what? What greater thing could the Lord
[1:03:20] give me than eternal life?
[1:03:23] name me anything of a higher value. And
[1:03:26] he's done that. It's like he doesn't owe
[1:03:29] me anything. Like he I don't deserve
[1:03:32] anything more, you know. He's given me
[1:03:33] the greatest gift that could ever be
[1:03:36] given
[1:03:36] me, you know. And that's why Paul says
[1:03:39] that godliness with contentment is great
[1:03:42] gain because he said we carried nothing
[1:03:44] into the world and it's certain we're
[1:03:45] going to carry nothing
[1:03:47] out. And you know that's when that
[1:03:49] scripture came in. If you have food and
[1:03:50] raignment, let us be content. you know,
[1:03:52] and it's um yeah, and it changes our
[1:03:55] life when we're grateful, when we're
[1:03:56] just we're we're
[1:03:59] just when you wake up in the morning,
[1:04:01] you take a breath. You know, you could
[1:04:04] wake up tomorrow morning and not take a
[1:04:06] breath or be very hard taking a breath.
[1:04:09] Imagine if you wake up in the morning,
[1:04:10] you get to barely breathe and you've got
[1:04:11] to live a day like that. Wouldn't that
[1:04:13] be
[1:04:15] awful? You know, there's an old saying,
[1:04:18] you don't know what you've got till it's
[1:04:19] gone. And I I I think, Lord, I never
[1:04:21] want to get like that. I want to realize
[1:04:23] what I've got when I've got it. You
[1:04:24] know, I wake up in the morning and I can
[1:04:26] breathe and I can jump out of bed and
[1:04:28] I'm it's I'm so blessed. I'm so
[1:04:31] grateful. I'm so happy.
[1:04:33] Amen. Amen. Let's just um let's just

[1:19:51] believe your face is turned upon each
[1:19:53] one here this evening, regardless of
[1:19:55] what the situation might be. Lord, we
[1:19:57] are so grateful that your faces turn
[1:19:59] towards us, Lord, in every situation as
[1:20:01] that we sung, Lord, in the morning, in
[1:20:03] the evening, in our coming and our
[1:20:05] going, and our weeping and our
[1:20:07] rejoicing. Lord, your face is always
[1:20:09] towards us, Lord Jesus. So, I just want
[1:20:12] to pray that and just pray you'll bless
[1:20:14] each one as they go their way this
[1:20:15] evening. And I just commit each one to
[1:20:16] your hands in Jesus name. And I also
[1:20:18] pray you bless the um circle family too.
[1:20:20] We always seem to sing that song
[1:20:21] whenever the um member of the family are
[1:20:25] here. So we just want to pray your
[1:20:26] blessing upon that family too, Lord
[1:20:28] Jesus.
[1:20:30] And we believe you're working a mighty
[1:20:31] work. Even when I don't see it, you're
[1:20:33] working, Lord
[1:20:35] Jesus. So we just commit um them and
[1:20:38] commit ourselves to you in Jesus
[1:20:39] wonderful name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:20:43] you all. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
