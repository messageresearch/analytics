[39:38] think it's worthy of
[39:41] like highlighting something made them
[39:42] loud man oh my
[39:44] god now is come you know now has come
[39:47] salvation

[39:54] accuser of our brethren
[39:56] is cast down hallelujah which accused
[39:59] them before our god day and night
[40:02] and they overcame him by the blood of
[40:06] the lamb
[40:06] and by the word of their testimony and
[40:08] they love not their lives unto death
[40:11] so that's going to encapsulate the whole
[40:13] thought tonight
[40:14] amen amen that's powerful
[40:18] we'll never touch the sides of it but
[40:20] we'll just have a little
[40:21] joy in the lord amen let's go to the
[40:24] next one here

[40:29] home
[40:30] it says here and i heard as it were the
[40:32] voice of a great multitude
[40:34] and as the voice of many waters and as
[40:37] the voice of
[40:38] mighty thunderings saying hallelujah
[40:42] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[40:45] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[40:48] honor to him
[40:49] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[40:52] and his wife has made herself ready
[40:55] and to her was granted that she
[40:58] should be arrayed and fine linen clean
[41:01] and wiped
[41:02] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[41:05] of saints
[41:06] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[41:10] they which are called unto the marriage
[41:12] supper
[41:12] of the lamb and he said unto me these
[41:15] are the true sayings
[41:16] of god may god add his blessings to his
[41:20] word

[41:24] is a group that
[41:25] i i believe that there this is the group
[41:28] that's going to be free right
[41:30] so somebody's going to be free there has
[41:33] been
[41:33] an atonement made there has been a king
[41:36] come a captain come
[41:37] and pay for it all he's paved the way so
[41:40] that there can be a people that is free
[41:42] right to be completely free from
[41:44] everything that sin has brought on the
[41:46] earth

[41:50] to receive that freedom
[41:52] amen why not you why not you
[41:55] amen now i'm speaking in a general term
[41:58] because
[41:58] there's many free people all right so
[42:01] don't think i'm
[42:02] saying that you're not free if you are
[42:03] free praise god amen
[42:05] but i believe that you can be more free
[42:07] amen hallelujah
[42:09] because see you're in a body that is
[42:11] natural see this natural body

[42:30] and they all shouted for joy
[42:32] amen they were all delivered they were
[42:34] all completely set free
[42:36] and that group is a reality amen who
[42:39] wants to be part of that group who's
[42:41] going to be there
[42:43] amen faith is the victory that overcomes
[42:45] this world

[42:49] don't try and figure it all out don't
[42:51] try and just reason it all away don't
[42:53] compromise to it
[42:55] just have faith and apply that faith
[42:58] in the one that made the way and the one
[43:01] that passed through selfishness
[43:02] and the one that passed through
[43:04] prejudice and the one that passed
[43:05] through all rebellion
[43:07] all witchcraft all hatred and malice and
[43:09] envy and jealousy

[43:32] bring you back up
[43:34] amen have faith have faith in god
[43:37] hallelujah remember who you're having
[43:40] faith in
[43:41] amen sometimes we get caught up in
[43:43] ourself in our own faith and do we
[43:45] believe enough
[43:46] and we forget who we're actually
[43:47] believing in right
[43:50] you know we get caught up on man i just

[44:16] and you start sharing
[44:18] what the lord has done for you amen and
[44:20] if it gets real bad then you just
[44:22] open up revelation chapter 20. go to
[44:24] verse 10

[44:50] here i just want you before i go there
[44:53] i just want you now to remember who
[44:56] you're putting your faith in and his
[44:58] power

[45:02] conquered
[45:03] how much has he conquered he's conquered
[45:05] all amen
[45:07] he came down from the highest place went
[45:09] to the lowest place
[45:10] looked up to the shortest man in the
[45:12] lowest city in the world and then he was
[45:14] raised up so that he had to look down on
[45:15] heaven
[45:16] and he let captivity captive and gave
[45:18] gifts unto men
[45:20] so that we could have victory so that we
[45:23] could be free
[45:24] so that we could have joy amen and so
[45:27] when something comes to you
[45:29] you can remember this he has conquered
[45:31] it
[45:32] he has completely conquered it it's
[45:34] finished

[45:51] the devil will tell you it's not going
[45:52] to come now it's going to come in a few
[45:54] years or it might come at a camp
[45:55] no happen now he conquered already he
[45:58] didn't conquer at the next camp

[46:32] you know the devil has a right punch on
[46:34] on us right and you've got to cover that
[46:36] with prayer so
[46:37] i'm just going to say a few things but
[46:39] then it might bring it up to the surface
[46:40] and it might just get shot in the head
[46:43] amen that's why i'm saying these right
[46:45] we don't want a glory and sinful
[46:47] uh attributes but let's just we're just
[46:50] gonna we're not gonna glory in it
[46:51] we're gonna expose it tonight so don't
[46:55] if i read something that's you're
[46:57] struggling with right now or maybe
[46:58] you're struggling with some of them
[47:00] many of them right because you're in the
[47:02] flesh
[47:03] in this body but i just tell you
[47:06] that don't just clam up tonight don't
[47:08] clam up because somebody's going to be
[47:10] free

[47:13] to be part of that somebody right
[47:15] hallelujah amen identify yourself right
[47:18] now with it

[47:37] can see this now but
[47:38] i'm just going to say read it out
[47:40] whether you see it
[47:41] so you know it says here you're going to
[47:43] be free from slavery
[47:44] from bondage from lust from fear
[47:48] from insecurity from jealousy from ill
[47:51] fame
[47:52] from depression obsession bitterness
[47:56] anger hatred laziness rejection
[47:59] and the fear of rejection and the fear
[48:02] of man and the fear of all these things
[48:04] it's just trapping people and the reason
[48:07] for
[48:07] let's just carry on sorry loneliness
[48:10] free from suicidal tendencies
[48:12] free from chemical imbalances because of
[48:14] a broken spirit
[48:16] free from dry bones in your own life who
[48:18] wants dry bones nobody
[48:20] wants dry bones we've heard a prophecy
[48:22] but
[48:23] prophesied over your dry bones it's not
[48:25] a valley of death anymore
[48:27] amen it's an army of the living god
[48:30] you've been prophesied over
[48:32] there's a word gone over your life that
[48:34] word has brought life back to you
[48:36] now faith overcomes everything that
[48:39] tries to bring you down to a dry bone
[48:41] condition
[48:42] and the way it comes to a dry bone
[48:44] condition
[48:45] is a broken spirit and how does it get a
[48:48] broken spirit
[48:49] but only if you get ensnared in the
[48:52] certainties
[48:53] of babylonian worship and all of the
[48:57] media and everything out there to
[48:59] ensnare your life
[49:01] to blind your eyes and actually will
[49:03] read in a vision
[49:05] where the prophet seen a people that
[49:07] were
[49:08] under that and it looked like they had
[49:10] cancers all over their eyes
[49:12] you see it's a very very carcinogenic
[49:15] thing
[49:17] and all the things i'm reading here that
[49:20] devil has got ways to bring you into it
[49:23] even real true believers
[49:26] can be ensnared in babylonian
[49:29] witchcraft rebellion loneliness
[49:32] depression
[49:33] fear all those things why
[49:36] by your spirit through your mind
[49:40] through your eyes your ears through the
[49:42] channels
[49:43] to get to your spirit to break it
[49:46] because a broken spirit
[49:47] dries the bones what does that do it
[49:50] brings your body into a chemical
[49:52] imbalance
[49:52] what does that do it makes you feel
[49:54] uncomfortable what does it do it makes
[49:56] you feel like you need something
[49:58] it makes you want instant gratification
[50:00] and because you're in that state
[50:02] when you pray you don't feel very good
[50:04] and then you trust your feelings and
[50:05] then you go what the heck
[50:06] i'm just going to go and watch something
[50:08] and then you go and get instant
[50:09] gratification
[50:10] and you start a snowball of destruction
[50:13] in your own life
[50:15] and that is a big problem a huge problem
[50:18] and that's how satan gets to the mind he
[50:21] starts to get to your eyes
[50:22] he starts to put cancer over your eyes
[50:24] and you can only half see
[50:26] and you sit in the church and it's and
[50:28] you're only getting half
[50:29] you're only getting a little bit but
[50:31] there's more
[50:33] somebody's gonna be free somebody's
[50:36] gonna be free amen
[50:38] are you that somebody why not you
[50:42] why not me why not there's no reason why
[50:45] not
[50:46] whosoever will whosoever will
[50:50] let them come and drink at the fountains
[50:53] of the waters of life freely and be
[50:55] washed by the water of the word
[50:57] take the crust off we serve a god
[51:00] that can heal cancer amen
[51:04] and maybe there's a babylonian cancer on
[51:06] your eye tonight that's stopping you
[51:08] from seeing
[51:10] stopping you from catching it you know
[51:14] because remember it all boils down to
[51:15] fault right
[51:17] thought i know it sounds very simple but
[51:19] god's thoughts are not our thoughts
[51:21] right
[51:21] they're way bigger and if you catch a
[51:24] thought of god
[51:25] it'll change your life forever the
[51:28] thoughts of god
[51:29] but you see if your eyes are coast uh
[51:32] crusted
[51:33] and if you you're down in a in a dungeon
[51:37] you can't grasp it it's just not you're
[51:39] not in that place to grasp it
[51:41] but you see god can bring you up god can
[51:44] bring you out of that
[51:46] god will bring you out of that because
[51:47] somebody's going to be free
[51:49] and it's going to be you you're going to
[51:51] be free
[51:52] you claim it tonight if you're
[51:54] struggling with something tonight
[51:55] claim your freedom tonight it's for you
[51:58] it is for you whatever it is the devil
[52:01] tells you it's so hard
[52:02] it's just such a big thing i'm going to
[52:04] have it all my life that's absolute lie
[52:07] absolute lie you don't have to be ruled
[52:09] by no sin
[52:10] you don't have to be ruled by no instant
[52:12] gratification
[52:14] i think i need a drink okay
[52:18] you don't have no one has to be ruled
[52:22] you know the devil's got a of
[52:24] counterfeit
[52:26] all of this is because people
[52:29] haven't tapped in to god's thoughts
[52:32] them tapped into god's joy they haven't
[52:35] tapped into the
[52:36] the peace and i know we probably sound
[52:39] like a broken record
[52:40] we always say it right that's so good
[52:43] it's so wonderful the children you hear
[52:46] it for all your life
[52:47] and then one day you taste one day it
[52:49] becomes real
[52:51] and you really have joy you really have
[52:54] peace and then you go why did i wait so
[52:56] long
[52:56] why did i wait all my life and i just
[52:58] sat in church bored
[53:00] and then all of a sudden one day the one
[53:02] that we talked about comes to your pew
[53:04] because you change your attitude because
[53:06] you finally when you know what i'm
[53:08] wasting my time here
[53:09] trying to make myself happy by all this
[53:11] stuff out there but it doesn't really
[53:13] hold you in a real state of joy and
[53:15] happiness
[53:16] it's just just just a temporal thing
[53:19] just while you're out there having the
[53:20] fun it's fine
[53:21] but the real the real thing the real joy
[53:26] the real love comes from the one that
[53:28] made it
[53:30] right isn't that logical we think of
[53:33] you know people say that faith is not
[53:34] logical i think it's more logical
[53:36] because what is logic right it's just
[53:39] satan's education
[53:42] it's satan saying this because of this
[53:44] and that because of that right
[53:45] taught us all our lives and we become so
[53:47] acclimatized to what he says is logical
[53:49] but actually no
[53:50] god is logical that's real logic
[53:53] heavenly faith logic if i believe and it
[53:56] happens that's my logic
[53:58] amen is that your logic amen
[54:01] you can't you can't this is a
[54:02] supernatural
[54:05] god is supernatural you're supernatural
[54:07] we come from him and we're going back to
[54:08] him
[54:09] so therefore let's become patriotic for
[54:12] the kingdom that we belong to
[54:14] amen stand for its laws stand for its
[54:16] values
[54:17] stand for its culture amen stand
[54:21] oh my be humble and proud of it
[54:25] amen
[54:28] amen it changes the way that you you
[54:31] know the devil tries to put fear on you
[54:34] make you embarrassed make you not want
[54:36] to share who you really are
[54:37] you know but just be be yourself
[54:41] we're on the winning time amen what can
[54:44] go wrong
[54:45] amen
[54:49] free from suicidal thoughts from
[54:50] chemical imbalances from sin
[54:52] as a as a whole indifference and
[54:55] rebellion and
[54:56] oh there's so many these things that we
[54:58] can be free from amen
[55:00] hallelujah someone's going to be free
[55:04] hey man amen i want to read this quote
[55:07] before i read it see we have a
[55:09] modern-day
[55:11] babylonian prison and this this i wasn't
[55:14] even looking for something like that but
[55:15] that popped up and i thought mate
[55:17] it's like encapsulating the what happens
[55:21] this is what happens pictorially and far
[55:24] more this is
[55:25] not gathering at all but just a little
[55:27] taste
[55:28] of what's happening what's happening
[55:31] when you are a prisoner in your own mind
[55:34] a prisoner in your own mind
[55:37] and really caught up in something that
[55:40] you don't
[55:40] really want to be caught up in but you
[55:42] get stuck in it right
[55:44] because of a broken spirit because
[55:46] you're spirit or something's wrong
[55:48] there's something in your life that
[55:50] needs to be delivered right
[55:51] there needs to be a deliverance there
[55:53] needs to be a healing there needs to be
[55:55] a change
[55:56] you can turn over a new leaf any day of
[55:58] the week you can have a new year's
[55:59] resolution
[56:00] that will not suffice the only thing
[56:03] that will suffice
[56:04] is when you have your visitation when
[56:08] jesus christ comes to you
[56:10] amen amen faith is the victory that
[56:13] overcomes your
[56:14] this jail amen faith is the victory
[56:18] you see but this is how the the
[56:21] babylonian
[56:22] kingdom works amen let's have a look at
[56:25] this quote here
[56:26] brother branham says i had a dream the
[56:29] other morning
[56:30] i don't dream very often i'm not a
[56:33] dreamer but
[56:34] i dreamed that i seen a man a young
[56:36] fellow in shackles
[56:39] and he was trying to get out and i said
[56:41] somebody told me
[56:43] said those are horrible people don't
[56:46] have nothing to do with them
[56:50] you know how the devil puts a scarecrow
[56:51] in front of a real believer
[56:53] that's what he does because a real
[56:55] believer's got treasure
[56:57] i'll tell you young people anyone that
[57:00] doesn't have the holy ghost and even if
[57:03] you do have the holy ghost
[57:05] you should always respect true believers
[57:09] realize that there is treasure in that
[57:12] person
[57:14] and who am i if we really esteemed each
[57:17] other better than ourself
[57:19] right how much more of a blessing will
[57:22] we get out of
[57:23] fellowshipping right being around your
[57:27] brethren who are
[57:30] full of treasure you're full of treasure
[57:33] amen there's so much in each one
[57:36] it's like a well he said he said this
[57:40] he that believes on me out of his belly
[57:42] shall
[57:43] flow rivers of living water yeah do you
[57:45] know what that water is
[57:48] that water is the river of god do you
[57:51] know where that river of god comes from
[57:53] it comes from eternity
[57:55] it comes from his throne so you are an
[57:58] outlet for the river of god
[58:02] i mean let's not take that lightly you
[58:05] are a river outlet
[58:06] you're a spring oh my now brother
[58:09] branham says
[58:10] you know you know that spring and i'm
[58:13] just paraphrasing because i'm talking
[58:14] about a spring
[58:15] that spring will not make itself known
[58:18] where it's not wanted
[58:19] right because it takes faith to operate
[58:22] the spring
[58:23] in each other right and so if you really
[58:26] believe
[58:27] you know and you really understand the
[58:29] spirit of fellowship
[58:30] and you go to somebody you can have a
[58:32] glorious time
[58:33] a glorious time and you can even receive
[58:36] things that you need
[58:37] spiritually right distant fellowship
[58:41] a glorious time god just comes down i
[58:43] mean we hear about it all the time right
[58:45] you talk about the lord
[58:46] walking on the road to emmaus with your
[58:47] buddy and you're just having fellowship
[58:49] and
[58:50] he's just around and it's just glorious
[58:52] what is that
[58:53] it's a spring of water flowing hey man
[58:58] amen
[59:03] he said oh my and i seen this young
[59:06] fellow getting out of his shackle
[59:09] so i just let him alone i thought i'll
[59:11] just see what he does
[59:14] so when he got out he was a nice fellow
[59:16] and i seen others trying to get out
[59:19] now this is only a dream and i walked
[59:22] over this way and i seen
[59:24] a brother roy borders a very good friend
[59:27] of mine lives in california
[59:29] so you see now no i'm not saying that i
[59:31] understand everything that's being in
[59:32] this vision but
[59:33] there's a few things that make sense and
[59:36] if you see here here is a true believer
[59:40] right
[59:41] a believer that's in california right
[59:43] now well not right now but in this
[59:45] vision in this thing
[59:46] god is showing brother branham one of
[59:48] his good friends
[59:50] and he's in california what is
[59:53] california we understand california is
[59:55] the seat of satan right
[59:56] it's the babylonian second babylonian
[59:59] has everyone
[1:00:00] understand the prophecy in revelation
[1:00:02] chapter 18
[1:00:03] how the millstone will be cast into the
[1:00:05] sea and we understand that in the
[1:00:07] choosing of the bride the prophet
[1:00:08] preached
[1:00:09] and he said that uh o capernaum
[1:00:12] capernaum
[1:00:12] and he says how los angeles the city of
[1:00:15] the angels
[1:00:16] you call yourself you shall be cast into
[1:00:19] the sea
[1:00:20] and the sea will all the way to the come
[1:00:23] up to the sultan sea which is a
[1:00:25] way inland basically saying that this is
[1:00:28] going to be the whole side of america is
[1:00:29] going to go in the ocean
[1:00:31] right and that's in revelation chapter
[1:00:33] 18. right at the
[1:00:35] prophecy of the second babylon there's
[1:00:37] two babylons
[1:00:38] one is in rome and one is in california
[1:00:40] these are two epicenters of
[1:00:42] lucifer's destruction of the human race
[1:00:46] religious and entertainment
[1:00:51] religious and political whatever you
[1:00:53] want to call it but there's two seats
[1:00:55] and so here we have a vision of a good
[1:00:58] friend
[1:00:59] of the of the prophet living in
[1:01:02] this place of satan's seat and he's
[1:01:05] looked like there was something wrong
[1:01:07] his eyes were half closed you see what i
[1:01:10] was saying before
[1:01:11] his eyes was half closed and great big
[1:01:14] maybe cancer or something over his eyes
[1:01:16] and someone was trying to pull me away
[1:01:19] from him
[1:01:20] i screamed brother borders in the name
[1:01:23] of the lord jesus
[1:01:24] snap out of that you see the prophet's
[1:01:27] heart went out for his good friends
[1:01:29] that were stuck in a babylonian
[1:01:31] condition with their eyes filmed over
[1:01:34] because of things that they were
[1:01:35] allowing into their life things that
[1:01:37] they were
[1:01:38] allowing into their family things that
[1:01:40] were going on
[1:01:41] that should not be going on but because
[1:01:43] a demon came down
[1:01:45] and wrapped itself around their
[1:01:47] reasoning channel and they
[1:01:48] lost the ability to reason with a godly
[1:01:52] conscience
[1:01:53] and i know firsthand how easy it is
[1:01:57] to sear your conscience and do things
[1:02:00] that you wouldn't normally do
[1:02:01] and you didn't used to do and yet you're
[1:02:04] a true believer
[1:02:05] god comes and fellowships with you and
[1:02:07] you have a glorious time in church
[1:02:09] and all of these things is going on but
[1:02:11] you're sinning
[1:02:12] but you're doing these things and it's
[1:02:14] keeping you with eyes half closed
[1:02:18] covered in cancer in vision
[1:02:21] right this is symbolic now this is good
[1:02:23] buddy
[1:02:25] in california in a babylonian condition
[1:02:27] stuck
[1:02:30] amen he says here
[1:02:35] and i and someone was trying to pull me
[1:02:37] you see now here the prophet
[1:02:38] had a heart for his friend come out snap
[1:02:42] out of it
[1:02:43] snap out of it but you see now god's
[1:02:45] gonna take him deeper or higher
[1:02:48] you see this vision gets it's like a
[1:02:49] liar it starts there and brother branham
[1:02:52] is now trying to deal with that
[1:02:53] he's just trying to deal with one person
[1:02:55] he's trying to deal with this one thing
[1:02:57] this one
[1:02:58] it's the fruit of sin he's trying to
[1:03:00] deal with that problem he's saying
[1:03:01] brother borders step out of it
[1:03:03] you know we want to say to each other
[1:03:05] snap out of it
[1:03:06] you can see something and you say snap
[1:03:08] out of it in your prayers and you just
[1:03:10] really want
[1:03:10] but sometimes you've got to go a little
[1:03:12] higher and watch this
[1:03:14] the lord takes the prophet higher he
[1:03:16] goes up a few layers until he gets to
[1:03:18] the very one that can do it
[1:03:20] hallelujah there's one that can do it
[1:03:23] amen we need to have some more
[1:03:25] supernatural prayer meetings
[1:03:27] we need to have some more supernatural
[1:03:28] fellowship supernatural
[1:03:31] encounters it is your inheritance saints
[1:03:34] you don't have to walk a natural
[1:03:36] christian life you don't have to
[1:03:39] you don't have to it is not your
[1:03:43] that's lots lot not your lot
[1:03:46] abraham had visitations amen you're the
[1:03:49] royal seed of abraham
[1:03:51] under a new covenant a new and living
[1:03:54] way
[1:03:55] not some shadow or not some ark or
[1:03:58] gold but a real living seventh seal
[1:04:00] revelation of jesus christ
[1:04:02] right excuse the terminology but this is
[1:04:05] the real
[1:04:06] real one they had an ark in the old
[1:04:09] testament but we've got the living one
[1:04:11] the what the person hallelujah
[1:04:14] comes down he prophesied in the fullness
[1:04:17] of his presence
[1:04:19] and you know you do not have to have a
[1:04:22] natural
[1:04:23] just a natural wandering walk
[1:04:26] you can have a poignant supernatural
[1:04:30] precise glorious walk with the lord
[1:04:34] regardless of the storms that are going
[1:04:36] on
[1:04:37] i'm preaching to myself because i'm
[1:04:39] always getting storms
[1:04:41] and the storms bring it down right you
[1:04:43] get down
[1:04:44] you don't feel good and you fail but
[1:04:48] it doesn't matter it doesn't that's just
[1:04:50] the that's just the daily
[1:04:52] grind right there's a bigger picture
[1:04:55] let's go to the bigger picture here
[1:04:57] hallelujah so you see he's now crying
[1:05:01] compassion sympathy whatever you want to
[1:05:03] call it to his friend
[1:05:05] come out of it snap out of it and we
[1:05:08] want to say that too you know
[1:05:09] we see something happening in our own
[1:05:11] life or in someone's life that we love
[1:05:12] and care about and
[1:05:13] you think step out of it but sometimes
[1:05:16] that's just not going to
[1:05:18] as it sees in the vision now remember
[1:05:21] it doesn't matter who says things in a
[1:05:23] vision it's god speaking
[1:05:25] he's causing those people to say those
[1:05:27] things in a vision right
[1:05:28] he says this and he just barely could
[1:05:32] speak
[1:05:34] he's saying brother branham it'll have
[1:05:36] to take something more than this
[1:05:40] i just can't grasp it brother branham i
[1:05:42] just can't grasp it
[1:05:44] because you see his eyes were filmed
[1:05:46] over where is that thing
[1:05:49] i couldn't get one that had so that was
[1:05:52] good enough
[1:05:53] you see there was something wrong with
[1:05:54] this vision
[1:05:56] something had happened to cause him to
[1:05:59] not be able to grasp
[1:06:01] it and i thought what is it
[1:06:05] what is it it's the lord it's the
[1:06:08] it's the it's what god it's his
[1:06:11] expression right
[1:06:12] it's the present truth it's the person
[1:06:16] speaking jesus is speaking
[1:06:19] jesus is doing jesus is unfolding
[1:06:22] prophecy
[1:06:23] jesus is fulfilling scripture can you
[1:06:26] grasp it
[1:06:28] does it impress you does it really move
[1:06:32] you
[1:06:34] or is it just nice information
[1:06:37] is that all it is
[1:06:40] or does it move you so deeply that you
[1:06:43] feel like you've just been
[1:06:45] you could just float away after a
[1:06:47] service and you just feel so moved
[1:06:50] maybe there's something in your life
[1:06:52] that's blocking that
[1:06:54] maybe you're in a prison in your mind
[1:07:03] oh i said oh brother borders and i love
[1:07:06] him
[1:07:08] and someone pulled me away and i looked
[1:07:09] and it was a lady standing over here
[1:07:12] that i when i was a little boy i used to
[1:07:14] haul groceries from the grocery store
[1:07:16] to the people and her name was
[1:07:20] mrs fenton and she lives in
[1:07:21] jeffersonville yet a personal friend of
[1:07:24] the wife and i and she said
[1:07:25] brother branham deliver us from this
[1:07:30] i said oh she said this is a house of
[1:07:33] hell
[1:07:35] and said you've been misunderstood and
[1:07:39] you misunderstood these people too
[1:07:42] said these are fine people and i looked
[1:07:44] over there and
[1:07:45] like a great big seller big walls
[1:07:49] down beneath a great big cave and great
[1:07:52] iron bars eight or ten inches thick
[1:07:56] oh my and people out of their mind
[1:08:01] twisted arms and legs beating their head
[1:08:04] like that
[1:08:05] this is god showing a vision right a
[1:08:07] dream this is god giving a dream
[1:08:10] this is the condition that babylon puts
[1:08:12] his people in
[1:08:13] this is the condition of someone that's
[1:08:16] stuck in a babylonian trap
[1:08:19] and their eyes is filmed over and god
[1:08:21] sees them as broken twisted limbs and
[1:08:23] and they can't you see and they're
[1:08:25] banging their heads because why
[1:08:27] madness absolute craziness this is what
[1:08:30] it brings
[1:08:32] and she was crying saying deliver the
[1:08:34] people brother branham
[1:08:36] said help us we're in trouble
[1:08:39] she herself i know her she belongs to
[1:08:41] the
[1:08:43] the church of christ or the christian
[1:08:45] church called the church of the brethren
[1:08:46] and
[1:08:47] uh we belong to the church of the
[1:08:48] brethren too amen and i believe that
[1:08:51] you see we're going to go a little
[1:08:53] higher
[1:08:54] i looked around and said i wished i
[1:08:56] could i wish i could
[1:08:59] you see we so desperately
[1:09:02] would want to see everybody free we want
[1:09:05] to see our young people
[1:09:06] free we want to see our children with
[1:09:07] the holy ghost we want to see our
[1:09:09] teenagers
[1:09:10] right up here just joy of the lord
[1:09:12] follow the holy ghost
[1:09:14] amen the gifts operating in their life
[1:09:15] and call to the ministry got a burden
[1:09:18] for the youth and the burden
[1:09:19] just to go out there and addicted
[1:09:21] themselves to the ministry
[1:09:23] it becomes your life you know i was so
[1:09:25] moved by that
[1:09:27] that service on sunday night by brother
[1:09:29] john anderson
[1:09:30] that's been that's been one of the
[1:09:33] biggest burdens of my
[1:09:34] whole everything i think with everything
[1:09:37] that i could
[1:09:38] imagine about that
[1:09:41] being it's everything this is everything
[1:09:45] god is everything the ministry and
[1:09:47] family and
[1:09:48] it's everything all that other stuff is
[1:09:51] so secondary i'm not going to say too
[1:09:54] much because you know how i feel about
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:57] but there is something happen
[1:10:00] to these people to be so addicted to the
[1:10:03] presence of god
[1:10:04] just so wanting to be part of it they
[1:10:07] just want to be around the christians
[1:10:08] they want to be ministering they want to
[1:10:09] be involved with the word they want to
[1:10:11] be doing god's service
[1:10:12] they want to be with the people they
[1:10:13] want to be fellowshipping they want to
[1:10:15] be in church

[1:10:17] a burden
[1:10:18] they want to go home they got they just
[1:10:21] they're just alarmed
[1:10:23] because of what they met the pillar of
[1:10:25] fire
[1:10:26] they met something they got something
[1:10:29] and i can guarantee you
[1:10:31] if you just meet that same one he
[1:10:34] changes
[1:10:34] everything he changes everything
[1:10:38] that's that makes the difference and i
[1:10:40] was praying so much when brother john
[1:10:42] was preaching lord

[1:10:45] come and visit them lord and
[1:10:48] give them their own reality their own
[1:10:50] burden
[1:10:52] and that's what it takes and i just
[1:10:55] encourage you young people

[1:11:22] shoulders and take you up
[1:11:24] oh my glory to god
[1:11:34] he says here

[1:11:39] could and go on looking around and
[1:11:42] my little bitty body and them great big
[1:11:45] iron bars
[1:11:48] iron represents rome roman
[1:11:52] imprisonments the roman beast
[1:11:55] that rules the earth through babylonian
[1:11:59] witchcraft and powers
[1:12:00] those poor people in there and you
[1:12:03] couldn't get to them
[1:12:04] them iron bars were sitting close
[1:12:07] together
[1:12:08] and i looked and they were beating their
[1:12:09] head like they were out of their mind
[1:12:13] these are real fine true people you
[1:12:16] watch what he says

[1:12:44] down
[1:12:45] that doesn't have to remain don't leave
[1:12:47] the service
[1:12:48] with the same thing you came with if you
[1:12:51] know if i read out something in that
[1:12:52] list
[1:12:53] then it was like a prescription that's
[1:12:55] and you you you think man that thing's
[1:12:57] been troubling me
[1:13:02] tonight
[1:13:04] tonight and you can say as the song
[1:13:08] not today if that thing's troubling you
[1:13:10] not today
[1:13:12] not today and for no longer right
[1:13:16] hallelujah and i seen some
[1:13:19] lights flickering around in there and i
[1:13:21] looked up and there stood the lord jesus
[1:13:23] with
[1:13:24] a light of rainbow around him he was
[1:13:26] looking right straight to me
[1:13:28] he said deliver those people and he went
[1:13:31] away
[1:13:31] and i thought well how can i deliver
[1:13:34] them
[1:13:36] i just want to stop there remember now
[1:13:39] he's gone from seeing the problem in
[1:13:41] brother borders as friend
[1:13:42] then he's seen to another lady now the
[1:13:44] lady tried to commission
[1:13:46] him right she tried to and
[1:13:49] they're not in a bad thing she just
[1:13:50] tried to say oh brother branham help us
[1:13:53] but you see now he's getting higher and
[1:13:55] higher and higher and sooner
[1:13:57] the commission is going to come from the
[1:13:59] right place
[1:14:00] right and then it makes a difference
[1:14:02] this is
[1:14:03] where we're getting to this is what
[1:14:05] makes the difference
[1:14:06] and i want to read that again it says

[1:17:30] of satan's eden
[1:17:31] to rescue you to bring him out of the
[1:17:34] darkest age and he's there
[1:17:38] and he says deliver these people
[1:17:41] you know he says that but behind those
[1:17:44] words is power
[1:17:46] behind those words is the atonement
[1:17:49] behind those words is total utter
[1:17:52] deliverance
[1:17:53] because somebody's gonna be free there
[1:17:56] is a people in eternity
[1:17:58] rejoicing shouting and i believe i'm
[1:18:00] looking at them
[1:18:02] right now right now
[1:18:05] i don't understand it but right now
[1:18:07] that's why we can say satan not today
[1:18:10] not today because i'm already there
[1:18:13] hallelujah i'm already up there i'm
[1:18:16] already rejoicing i'm already shouting
[1:18:18] hallelujah all the sons of god shouted
[1:18:23] all of them hallelujah they finally
[1:18:26] grasped it
[1:18:28] oh my that was a bit naughty but it was
[1:18:31] true
[1:18:31] they finally grasped it in its enormity
[1:18:34] and its magnificence and its glory
[1:18:36] because of this flesh it taints our
[1:18:38] perception
[1:18:40] it takes how glorious the word is
[1:18:43] it's why the prophet cried in the church
[1:18:45] age book are we sufficiently
[1:18:48] sufficiently impressed
[1:18:51] how can you be here you think oh my but
[1:18:54] something moves you
[1:18:56] and you lose yourself and the prophet
[1:18:58] says he crossed over
[1:18:59] you know david he said when david was
[1:19:01] dancing around the ark
[1:19:03] it said he crossed over i thought my i
[1:19:05] want to cross over
[1:19:07] you just get so beside yourself oh my
[1:19:11] you can't handle this world anymore and
[1:19:12] you get you just start vibrating too
[1:19:14] fast
[1:19:15] hey man you just start going too fast
[1:19:18] and you just spin into another dimension
[1:19:21] i believe i will do that one day forever
[1:19:24] oh my oh he crossed over
[1:19:28] oh my he lost all self styles he said he
[1:19:31] lost self styles you know
[1:19:33] we have a style it's generally forged by
[1:19:36] our experiences and our family traits
[1:19:38] and our culture and all those things
[1:19:40] we've become inadvertently which means
[1:19:43] you don't mean to do it it just happens
[1:19:46] uh a patriot for our own limitations and
[1:19:49] cultures and
[1:19:50] whatever we are as a human
[1:19:53] naturally but then there's something
[1:19:56] inside
[1:19:57] that's fighting its way out oh my
[1:20:00] hallelujah you can make this whole thing
[1:20:04] personal right
[1:20:05] this cage can be the house of hell
[1:20:08] and it really is depends what level you
[1:20:11] want to look at it
[1:20:12] you can look at it on all levels if you
[1:20:14] make it personal
[1:20:16] you see the cage of your flesh is going
[1:20:18] to break
[1:20:19] under a prophecy when the prophet got
[1:20:22] commissioned by this one here we're
[1:20:23] reading
[1:20:24] you know if you read between the lines
[1:20:26] and you get under inspiration
[1:20:28] you can see some things here that really
[1:20:30] show you
[1:20:31] the intent of god the plan of god the
[1:20:34] program of god the
[1:20:36] what's going to happen this is a this is
[1:20:39] a deep
[1:20:40] this is a very deep dream but it's also
[1:20:43] very simple
[1:20:44] and it's also very applicable very
[1:20:46] practical and it's yours
[1:20:49] so you need to take it
[1:20:52] this is this is the first time it's come
[1:20:54] for me to say it in
[1:20:55] a service but i'll say it because it
[1:20:57] never comes i think man i'd love to say
[1:20:59] that one day but
[1:21:00] you know israel i was driving one day in
[1:21:02] the lord he um
[1:21:03] i was just driving and and i was just
[1:21:06] pondering over
[1:21:08] israel and their struggle natural israel
[1:21:11] now in their struggle and how they
[1:21:14] i mean they're just such it's only the
[1:21:17] lord that can keep them there right
[1:21:19] and if you watch all the videos and all
[1:21:21] of the all the
[1:21:22] documentaries of how they came back to
[1:21:25] the land it's all supernatural
[1:21:27] but yet natural god works in
[1:21:29] supernaturally natural ways
[1:21:33] and the world like the devil's trying to
[1:21:35] delete the history delete their identity
[1:21:37] and
[1:21:38] the palestinians which is really the
[1:21:39] philistines the ancient philistine
[1:21:42] those they're just trying to you know
[1:21:44] use
[1:21:45] the political agenda and they're trying
[1:21:48] to work on
[1:21:49] on the human sympathy and the devils
[1:21:51] right there and the whole world's coming
[1:21:53] against them but
[1:21:53] you see they have an identity and this
[1:21:56] identity cannot be removed from them
[1:21:59] so i was driving and i've been to israel
[1:22:02] so i
[1:22:03] this is why i was thinking about it and
[1:22:05] i thought it was just so
[1:22:06] it's just so different from here and
[1:22:08] probably most of our countries
[1:22:10] unless you come from a country that's
[1:22:11] got lots of ancient civilizations there
[1:22:13] but
[1:22:14] you see when they and i because i'm in
[1:22:16] construction i'm thinking of building
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:18] and i thought of israel and how when
[1:22:20] they build
[1:22:22] they do excavation and they find like
[1:22:24] solomon's porch
[1:22:26] or they find something that relates to
[1:22:28] their history
[1:22:30] right in the old testament they find
[1:22:32] something
[1:22:33] and in the world no matter how much the
[1:22:35] philistines come against them with
[1:22:37] political powers
[1:22:38] and with all these reasonings and all
[1:22:40] this stuff they
[1:22:41] cannot delete the history they cannot
[1:22:44] take their identity
[1:22:45] because they dig down into the old
[1:22:48] testament
[1:22:49] under the construction and they find
[1:22:52] their history
[1:22:53] and they say that's me i can see myself
[1:22:55] in ray here but i can see myself in ruth
[1:22:58] i can see myself and david i can see
[1:23:00] myself in solomon
[1:23:01] i can see myself because a prophet came
[1:23:04] a master uh
[1:23:06] excavator an archaeologist who got
[1:23:08] commissioned by this one
[1:23:10] he got commissioned by this one with a
[1:23:11] rainbow about his head a man with an
[1:23:13] anointing
[1:23:14] and a book that came open hallelujah
[1:23:17] and it came open and it said dig here
[1:23:20] and when you dig there you'll see
[1:23:21] yourself
[1:23:22] and the devil will never be able to take
[1:23:24] it away from you
[1:23:25] he will never be able to refute you
[1:23:28] because you can see yourself
[1:23:30] right there you can see yourself there's
[1:23:34] no you know my
[1:23:38] how glorious it is when you see yourself
[1:23:41] right through the old testament
[1:23:42] get down and find who you really are
[1:23:44] because we have an open book
[1:23:46] and the open book opened many books
[1:23:50] it opened the book of the word to reveal
[1:23:53] jesus christ but it opened the book of
[1:23:56] your own life
[1:23:57] to reveal who you are and it opened the
[1:24:00] book of every life of every believer
[1:24:02] written in the bible
[1:24:04] and then you read their life and it's no
[1:24:06] longer a mystery
[1:24:07] it's you it's the word
[1:24:11] hallelujah it's you and the devil can't
[1:24:14] fight you
[1:24:15] he can't take away your identity that's
[1:24:18] why i encourage you
[1:24:19] you know young people we listen
[1:24:23] to the services and we hear about all
[1:24:27] these types
[1:24:28] but just remember this there's power in
[1:24:31] them
[1:24:32] there is power in them to to prove your
[1:24:34] identity
[1:24:36] so don't do away with the old testament
[1:24:38] the devil will do away with it he
[1:24:40] doesn't want it all these modern
[1:24:41] churches out there
[1:24:42] they think it's not even needed anymore
[1:24:45] oh my my oh i won't even say who it was
[1:24:48] but
[1:24:49] i've talked to family and they're like
[1:24:51] why are you reading the old testament
[1:24:52] i'm like going
[1:24:53] i'm not even going to even start this
[1:24:55] conversation
[1:24:56] you know what's the point
[1:25:00] where are you going to get to but unless
[1:25:01] there's election there
[1:25:04] but i just love that
[1:25:07] he came he wants you to know who you are
[1:25:11] he wants you in victory he wants you to
[1:25:14] have happiness
[1:25:15] he wants you to have joy he wants you to
[1:25:17] have peace
[1:25:18] he wants you to have a supernatural life
[1:25:21] all of you
[1:25:22] everyone not just an academic reality
[1:25:25] he wants a supernatural reality right
[1:25:28] now
[1:25:30] don't leave the service until you've got
[1:25:31] a supernatural reality
[1:25:33] you can have it whatever you ask
[1:25:37] believing you shall have it just ask him
[1:25:40] now
[1:25:40] lord i pl give me
[1:25:43] a supernatural reality you might go
[1:25:46] through some trials
[1:25:48] you will go for some trials oh my and
[1:25:51] you
[1:25:51] don't falter under those see jesus says
[1:25:55] satan has desired that he may sift you
[1:25:56] as wheat
[1:25:58] but don't worry i've prayed that thy
[1:26:01] faith will fail not
[1:26:04] well and then the lord in john 17 pray
[1:26:06] for us that we would
[1:26:08] be kept right through every trial
[1:26:12] amen hallelujah
[1:26:18] deliver those people i just can't get
[1:26:21] past it i'll go
[1:26:23] and he went away and i thought well how
[1:26:25] could i deliver them i haven't got
[1:26:27] strength enough in my arms to break
[1:26:28] those bars
[1:26:29] so i said hallelujah house of hell
[1:26:34] give way to the name of jesus
[1:26:37] and all the creaking and popping and
[1:26:39] rocks rolling and bars falling and
[1:26:41] people running
[1:26:42] and screaming delivered delivered
[1:26:45] that's why i said say it deliver it
[1:26:48] because you are part of that amen
[1:26:51] you got set free from babylon he said he
[1:26:55] called to the age come out of him my
[1:26:56] people
[1:26:57] you heard the voice you heard house of
[1:27:00] hell give way
[1:27:01] to the name of jesus the name of jesus
[1:27:05] is more than a title the name of jesus
[1:27:09] is the revelation of the word made
[1:27:12] manifest
[1:27:13] right when the word make is made
[1:27:16] manifest and the light shines
[1:27:18] on you know there's a revelation of the
[1:27:20] name
[1:27:21] it's a revelation of who he is
[1:27:23] hallelujah
[1:27:24] because a name identifies a person
[1:27:28] not a title to a person it's more than
[1:27:30] that
[1:27:31] and identifies a person amen
[1:27:36] and screaming at the top of their voice
[1:27:38] and
[1:27:39] they was all delivered
[1:27:44] god doesn't do a half job he won't do a
[1:27:46] half job in your life
[1:27:48] just have faith have faith just have
[1:27:51] faith in god
[1:27:53] hallelujah the definition of bondage
[1:27:56] a tenure or service of a villain surf or
[1:27:59] slave
[1:28:00] a state of being bound usually by
[1:28:03] compulsion
[1:28:05] as of law or mastery
[1:28:09] it's quite deep we're not going to go
[1:28:11] through it
[1:28:12] but just think about it
[1:28:18] captivity is another definition
[1:28:21] servitude or subjugation to a
[1:28:24] controlling person
[1:28:25] or force that is bondage
[1:28:29] bondage a state of being bound
[1:28:32] usually by compulsion something that is
[1:28:36] compelling
[1:28:37] you're being compelled by a force
[1:28:39] compelled by a
[1:28:40] lust compelled by
[1:28:44] a habit compelled by a
[1:28:47] need for comfort a need
[1:28:50] for comfort compelled young ones
[1:28:53] at school by a need to be accepted
[1:28:57] who feels that that you feel this desire
[1:29:01] young people most of the you feel like
[1:29:04] there's a pressure i need to be accepted
[1:29:08] and when you're not accepted you're hurt
[1:29:09] right that's the world
[1:29:12] satan stuffed up his own kingdom because
[1:29:14] it's a kingdom of
[1:29:15] non-acceptance and it drives the people
[1:29:18] to do things that they don't
[1:29:19] want to do and unfortunately believers
[1:29:22] get caught up in the same
[1:29:24] trap and it's a cycle of death
[1:29:28] it takes you down because you can never
[1:29:31] you'll try to earn
[1:29:32] acceptance you can't you see but let me
[1:29:35] tell you
[1:29:36] and listen very carefully you
[1:29:39] are already accepted in the beloved
[1:29:43] you're accepted in christ no matter what
[1:29:46] how good or bad or whatever
[1:29:48] you're accepted you're accepted for who
[1:29:51] you are
[1:29:52] not what you can do you're accepted in
[1:29:54] the brethren
[1:29:57] because of you you don't have to be or
[1:30:00] try
[1:30:00] amen you don't have to perform
[1:30:04] or put on a personality to be cool
[1:30:08] you don't have to you are accepted
[1:30:12] totally thoroughly accepted
[1:30:15] you you never have to earn that rebecca
[1:30:18] you don't have to earn it
[1:30:20] you don't have to earn acceptance in
[1:30:21] your friends in christ
[1:30:24] if you have friends in the world
[1:30:26] unfortunately they don't have god's love
[1:30:28] in them
[1:30:28] it's it's conditional so friendship
[1:30:32] in the world is conditional and it's
[1:30:35] based on performance
[1:30:36] based on what you can bring what can you
[1:30:39] bring to this relationship
[1:30:41] and it makes you it compels you by
[1:30:44] compulsion
[1:30:46] it compels you it drives you to do
[1:30:48] simple things
[1:30:49] to say a simple thing who can be the
[1:30:52] baddest who's watched the worst movie
[1:30:54] who's who's done the worst thing who's
[1:30:56] played the r16 rap video game
[1:30:58] who's done this because you're trying to
[1:31:01] be accepted
[1:31:02] you're trying to be included and what it
[1:31:05] is
[1:31:06] is hovering over that group of
[1:31:08] friendships as a demon
[1:31:10] and that demon is bringing a son or
[1:31:13] daughter of god
[1:31:14] out of their position as a child
[1:31:17] so that you can be acceptable remember
[1:31:19] in christ
[1:31:21] you cannot earn acceptance you are
[1:31:26] accepted and that's at full stop
[1:31:28] eternally
[1:31:30] oh my you know that's a real revelation
[1:31:34] and i and i just encourage the groups of
[1:31:37] young friends in the church don't
[1:31:41] try and make each other accept you or
[1:31:43] don't try and make someone be accepted
[1:31:45] by you
[1:31:46] accept them love them unconditionally
[1:31:51] amen they might have times where they
[1:31:53] say something stupid or whatever
[1:31:55] just love them anyway be accepting
[1:31:58] that's that's more than what we realize
[1:32:00] it's more than what we realize and we've
[1:32:03] all been through
[1:32:04] many of us have been through the peer
[1:32:06] pressure
[1:32:07] of school and the peer pressure of
[1:32:09] belonging
[1:32:11] you belong you already belong
[1:32:14] you belong in christ you belong in the
[1:32:16] greatest team
[1:32:17] the greatest family this is our family
[1:32:20] and we're accepted we didn't have to
[1:32:22] earn it and we're from very different
[1:32:25] paths very different cultures very
[1:32:26] different but we have become part of one
[1:32:28] body
[1:32:29] amen amen part of one body
[1:32:34] what is freedom definition of freedom
[1:32:37] this says here the quality or state of
[1:32:39] being free
[1:32:41] the absence of necessity the
[1:32:44] the absence of coercion
[1:32:48] that means to be forced to be coerced
[1:32:50] with fertility
[1:32:51] something that's stronger than you or or
[1:32:54] pretends to be stronger than you
[1:32:56] if you believe the lie you can have a
[1:32:58] tiny little little
[1:33:00] dog right let's just use a tiny little
[1:33:03] uh elf or whatever i don't know and a
[1:33:06] big strong
[1:33:07] but if that big strong man is gullible
[1:33:10] and that little elf says i'm stronger
[1:33:11] than you
[1:33:13] and that giant starts getting scared
[1:33:15] he's going to be overcome by that little
[1:33:16] thing right
[1:33:17] but that could just go boop but he's
[1:33:19] believed
[1:33:20] the lie that's the devil
[1:33:24] young people that's the devil he is so
[1:33:28] weaker than you not because of who you
[1:33:31] or what you've got in your own strength
[1:33:33] but it's christ
[1:33:35] you are a son and daughter of god amen
[1:33:39] you have authority and the devil hates
[1:33:43] it and when you realize you've got
[1:33:44] authority
[1:33:45] when you realize that when you speak and
[1:33:47] it happens and the devil can't do that
[1:33:49] he ain't got no spoken word you've got
[1:33:51] the spoken word
[1:33:53] you got the spoken word it's in you and
[1:33:55] he hates it
[1:33:57] because you're going to speak things
[1:33:58] that they're going to happen
[1:34:00] because somebody's going to be free and
[1:34:01] you're going to be part of that somebody
[1:34:03] amen we're just gonna get freer and
[1:34:05] freer and freer
[1:34:06] and freer amen hallelujah
[1:34:10] liberation from slavery look absence of
[1:34:14] absence of coercion the absence of
[1:34:16] constraint man i wish i had time to get
[1:34:19] into this
[1:34:19] the absence and this is the liberation
[1:34:23] from slavery the liberation from
[1:34:25] restraint
[1:34:26] deliberation from the power of another
[1:34:30] to come now i won't even get too far
[1:34:33] into this at all
[1:34:34] but you need to be liberated from the
[1:34:36] power of darkness
[1:34:37] so that you can be accepted as a love
[1:34:40] slave to christ
[1:34:42] right the human being
[1:34:45] must be a slave to something
[1:34:49] you must serve something
[1:34:53] you there's no void whatever
[1:34:56] you are right now whatever condition
[1:34:59] you're in
[1:35:00] whatever you think how well you can do
[1:35:03] it
[1:35:03] you're a slave to something or someone
[1:35:07] amen whether directly or indirectly
[1:35:10] whether it's through your own ideas
[1:35:12] you're a slave
[1:35:14] to some ideology why not be a slave
[1:35:17] to the one that loves your soul the one
[1:35:19] that will take you and give you joy
[1:35:22] be a slave to the right thing don't be a
[1:35:25] slave to some
[1:35:26] human concoction amen
[1:35:30] oh my sorry i'm gonna get i'm gonna get
[1:35:33] through this
[1:35:34] the quality or state of being exempt or
[1:35:37] released
[1:35:38] i like that you got diplomatic immunity
[1:35:41] amen
[1:35:42] hallelujah you're in your own little
[1:35:43] embassy
[1:35:45] all the devil's laws and what he says
[1:35:47] you can't you can
[1:35:48] amen because you're in your own embassy
[1:35:51] you've got your own law and that's his
[1:35:53] law
[1:35:53] you've got your own freedom diplomatic
[1:35:57] immunity
[1:35:57] complete diplomatic immunity if anyone
[1:36:00] does not know what that means
[1:36:02] come and see me hallelujah
[1:36:05] that's very powerful that's a whole
[1:36:07] sermon in itself diplomatic immunity
[1:36:10] you know okay i'll just just quickly if
[1:36:12] an ambassador comes from china right
[1:36:14] and the an ambassador comes over to new
[1:36:16] zealand when he's in his house
[1:36:18] it's chinese law through and thorough
[1:36:21] it's china
[1:36:22] in new zealand and he he can do whatever
[1:36:26] he likes according to chinese law
[1:36:28] new zealand law unless he comes and
[1:36:30] breaks the new zealand law on the
[1:36:31] outside
[1:36:32] then there will be probably trouble
[1:36:34] between the countries
[1:36:35] you see now that's where it gets a
[1:36:37] little bit more
[1:36:38] interesting because we we
[1:36:42] are under a diplomatic immunity for
[1:36:44] heaven and when we come out here we
[1:36:46] start breaking satan's laws
[1:36:47] and then there becomes a fight between
[1:36:49] heaven and hell because you're breaking
[1:36:51] his laws
[1:36:52] you're defying his laws you're walking
[1:36:54] on the water
[1:36:55] amen you're walking on the storms you
[1:36:57] are called
[1:36:58] to walk on the storms you are called
[1:37:01] to walk stable stable
[1:37:05] and that starts with your spirit that
[1:37:08] starts with you and i know your spirit
[1:37:09] never going to be converted but your
[1:37:11] spirit can be healthy
[1:37:12] your spirit can get healed like your
[1:37:14] body you say oh i've got a broken arm or
[1:37:17] i've got a cancer or whatever
[1:37:19] and you go out for prayer and you get
[1:37:21] oil and you get healed
[1:37:23] and you leave your spirit in a condition
[1:37:25] of cancer
[1:37:27] think about that real deep now real deep
[1:37:31] treat it the same just because of
[1:37:33] physical pain you make it more of an
[1:37:34] urgency
[1:37:35] but then you live with a squatter in
[1:37:37] your land
[1:37:38] you live with a squatter in your human
[1:37:40] spirit
[1:37:42] and it becomes a tributary lives in your
[1:37:44] own life
[1:37:46] and all it's doing is it's blocking you
[1:37:48] from the spoken word
[1:37:50] it's blocking you from rapturing faith
[1:37:53] you've got rapturing faith in you but
[1:37:55] there's enemies stopping it
[1:37:57] now i'm gonna say something every
[1:38:00] one of them enemies has got a number on
[1:38:02] its head cross hairs hallelujah
[1:38:05] they've got heavenly crosses heavenly
[1:38:07] crosses every enemy in your life
[1:38:09] everyone take refuge in this thought
[1:38:14] it's such a glorious thing rest assured
[1:38:18] that by the time we go there ain't going
[1:38:20] to be no squatters in your lap
[1:38:22] hey man little by little
[1:38:26] faith is a victory that overcomes the
[1:38:27] world and somebody
[1:38:30] someone's going to be free is that you
[1:38:34] i'm going to be free amen i'm getting
[1:38:36] freer and freer and free every day
[1:38:39] every day i just keep getting more and
[1:38:40] more free hey man when i fail i just get
[1:38:43] more and more free
[1:38:44] when i have a victory i get more free
[1:38:46] when the devil comes at me like a flood
[1:38:48] i just get more free
[1:38:49] hey man who's who's with me do you just
[1:38:52] keep getting more free
[1:38:53] amen why because you're on the winning
[1:38:55] team and if you're not on the winning
[1:38:57] team
[1:38:58] get on the winning team as we sing that
[1:39:00] song the old ship of zion get on board
[1:39:03] it's landed all these people it's landed
[1:39:06] noah's landed brother branham as land of
[1:39:08] john the baptist has landed everyone
[1:39:10] that's gone on it's landed them
[1:39:13] we're in heaven hallelujah
[1:39:16] exempt or released usually from
[1:39:18] something onerous and i looked up
[1:39:20] onerous
[1:39:21] and it says here involving imposing or
[1:39:24] constituting a burden troublesome
[1:39:27] amen oh my
[1:39:31] hallelujah freedom is deliverance from
[1:39:33] that
[1:39:34] having legal obligations that outweigh
[1:39:36] the advantages
[1:39:38] whenever you get into a deal with the
[1:39:39] devil
[1:39:41] come on he's just a real businessman
[1:39:43] he's a one-sided businessman you know
[1:39:45] you got businessmen
[1:39:46] that do a good deal for everybody right
[1:39:48] that's our motto everyone wins and it
[1:39:50] works and it's sustainable but then
[1:39:51] you've got businessmen out there
[1:39:53] but it's all about their business
[1:39:56] and they don't care who they're going to
[1:39:58] burn they burn bridges they make bad
[1:40:00] deals and it's all about how much they
[1:40:02] can get they don't give us
[1:40:05] anything about um anyone else
[1:40:09] they just want to make sure they're the
[1:40:10] one that gets all that's the devil's
[1:40:12] business man
[1:40:14] that's the devil's tactic on your
[1:40:16] contract that you ever make with him
[1:40:18] you make a deal you might not realize
[1:40:20] you're making a deal
[1:40:21] but anytime you go out of the word into
[1:40:24] something that is not of god
[1:40:26] into something that is from the tree of
[1:40:27] knowledge you are making a contract with
[1:40:30] the devil
[1:40:31] who no one if i said who wants to make a
[1:40:33] contract with the devil
[1:40:35] i'm sure no one will put their hand up
[1:40:37] but if we under inspiration
[1:40:39] could discern and it was like if
[1:40:41] something rose up i'm sure hands would
[1:40:43] go up
[1:40:44] that's making a contract with the devil
[1:40:45] right now or doing a deal with the devil
[1:40:47] you've got to be careful that's why we
[1:40:50] must be led by the spirit of god
[1:40:53] we must have divine leadership leading
[1:40:55] us and when we go
[1:40:57] should i look at this book should i
[1:40:59] watch this
[1:41:00] should i read this should i play this
[1:41:02] should i go to that group
[1:41:04] should i go be part of that group at
[1:41:05] school should i play that music
[1:41:07] before i do it i'm going to say lord
[1:41:11] is this your will lord will this help me
[1:41:15] because if it doesn't we go back to this
[1:41:18] this will be your eyes spiritually
[1:41:20] speaking
[1:41:22] and you'll become a prisoner in your own
[1:41:24] head
[1:41:25] and you know what you'll do you'll go
[1:41:26] crazy and you'll start smashing your
[1:41:27] head
[1:41:28] and you do crazy stuff that's how the
[1:41:31] lord sees it
[1:41:32] because it's a babylonian trap and you
[1:41:34] see
[1:41:35] the longer the devil can keep our young
[1:41:37] people in these traps and keep people
[1:41:39] under some regime it just delays things
[1:41:43] it just brings things down it just
[1:41:45] you know but we are overcomers you are
[1:41:47] an overcomer
[1:41:48] and if there's something that's happened
[1:41:50] in your life whoever you may be whatever
[1:41:52] age you may be
[1:41:53] tonight don't leave don't leave
[1:41:57] until that's gone have tenacity have
[1:42:00] resolve
[1:42:02] because faith is the victory that
[1:42:04] overcomes the world
[1:42:07] i am going to close
[1:42:18] man i'm just going to skim this i'm not
[1:42:21] going to read it
[1:42:22] but you see we've been called and see
[1:42:26] jesus sent
[1:42:26] out people to call to a marriage supper
[1:42:30] because in the marriage is your
[1:42:31] deliverance in the marriage is your
[1:42:34] healing
[1:42:34] in the marriage in the marriage is your
[1:42:38] freedom

[1:42:47] and precious to you you see
[1:42:51] he made his way down this is the
[1:42:53] greatest calling
[1:42:54] there's nothing greater to be called to
[1:42:56] the marriage suffer of the lamb right
[1:42:59] so here you have the golden ticket
[1:43:02] this is everything that humans live for
[1:43:04] right it's this this is the one moment
[1:43:06] and
[1:43:07] all of creation all of redemption
[1:43:10] all of it this invitation you have an
[1:43:13] invitation
[1:43:15] everybody tonight every one of us has an
[1:43:18] invitation you are being called to the
[1:43:19] wedding supper
[1:43:21] and you see you went through all these
[1:43:22] different echelons of society
[1:43:25] until he got down to the misfits
[1:43:29] got down to the down and outs got down
[1:43:31] to the highways and the hedges
[1:43:33] what is it about these people that make
[1:43:36] them
[1:43:37] candidates for the eternity
[1:43:40] candidates for supernatural what is it
[1:43:44] what is it that makes them of equality
[1:43:48] what is it about them what is it
[1:43:52] why is it that these people you know
[1:43:55] in a general sense just get so beat down
[1:44:01] and and and they've and god found these
[1:44:03] people
[1:44:05] in such a condition that they were down
[1:44:08] and out and broken
[1:44:10] and he found them and they were the ones
[1:44:12] who said i'll come
[1:44:14] and really god doesn't make mistakes
[1:44:16] they were god's people
[1:44:18] they were elect they are elect and yet
[1:44:21] they're just full of
[1:44:23] they're just down and out here they are
[1:44:26] what is it do you know what it is the
[1:44:29] devil out to get them
[1:44:31] the devil want to beat them down he
[1:44:33] wants to beat you down
[1:44:34] and if you walk out of the protection of
[1:44:37] god
[1:44:38] walk out from the blood the things he
[1:44:41] will do
[1:44:42] the things he can do he's a advantage
[1:44:44] taker
[1:44:45] don't let him take advantage of you amen
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:50] so there's a people called to this
[1:44:53] marriage supper
[1:44:54] says go out into the highways and hedges
[1:44:56] and compel them to come in that my house
[1:44:58] may be filled you see here it says in
[1:45:01] romans 7
[1:45:03] and we're talking now about this this
[1:45:06] this woman who says no you're not
[1:45:08] breathing for i speak to them that know
[1:45:09] the law
[1:45:10] how that the law has dominion over a man
[1:45:12] as long as he lives for the woman which
[1:45:13] hasn't husband
[1:45:14] is bound by the law to her husband so
[1:45:16] long as he liveth
[1:45:17] but if the husband be dead she is loosed
[1:45:20] from the law of her husband
[1:45:22] so then if while her husband liveth
[1:45:24] she'd be married to another man
[1:45:26] she shall be called an adulteress but if
[1:45:28] her husband be dead
[1:45:30] she is free from that law so she is no
[1:45:33] adulteress
[1:45:33] though she be married to another man
[1:45:36] wherefore my brethren
[1:45:38] ye also have become dead to the law by
[1:45:40] the body of christ
[1:45:42] you are dead to the law because of the
[1:45:44] body of christ
[1:45:46] oh my the body of christ took all sin
[1:45:49] upon himself broke it so that you could
[1:45:52] be free from the law
[1:45:53] but no not only that but that brought
[1:45:56] you
[1:45:56] into a place where you could come into
[1:45:58] fellowship with the very one
[1:46:01] but said to brother branham deliver
[1:46:03] those people
[1:46:05] you have been connected to the very one
[1:46:07] that said that
[1:46:08] and he's got the power to deliver you
[1:46:11] he's got the power to set you free
[1:46:13] he's got the power to heal all he's
[1:46:15] healed all sickness he's healed it all
[1:46:16] because he dealt with sin and sin has
[1:46:18] been done
[1:46:19] away with it says here that you should
[1:46:22] be married to another
[1:46:24] even to him so here is
[1:46:27] a death to self that's why you should
[1:46:30] never doubt the power of the altar
[1:46:32] the altar is the place of sacrifice the
[1:46:35] altar is the place where christ
[1:46:36] died for everything and the body of
[1:46:38] death is there to say
[1:46:40] you all sin has been broken now he's
[1:46:42] calling his people
[1:46:44] to come and fall on that altar and
[1:46:47] die to themself a living sacrifice
[1:46:51] why so that the divine influence of
[1:46:53] grace
[1:46:54] can come down and change your life and
[1:46:57] tonight is a life changing
[1:46:58] for you if you believe it if you want it
[1:47:02] young people if you want it it's for you
[1:47:04] tonight
[1:47:05] to change everything to give you a new
[1:47:08] operating system
[1:47:10] who knows what an operating system is
[1:47:12] you know
[1:47:13] on a computer a computer has an
[1:47:15] operating system
[1:47:16] we're born with a very bad one like 95
[1:47:20] dos but amen
[1:47:24] we've got a upgrade we've got an upgrade
[1:47:26] that came from the mind of god
[1:47:28] and goes back to the mind of god that's
[1:47:30] how much better
[1:47:31] it is for those that know about
[1:47:34] computers for those that don't know i'm
[1:47:36] very sorry
[1:47:39] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:47:41] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:47:43] god
[1:47:44] for when we were in the flesh the
[1:47:45] motions of sins
[1:47:47] which were by the law did work in our
[1:47:49] members to bring forth fruit under death
[1:47:51] but now we are delivered can everyone
[1:47:55] just say delivered
[1:47:57] we are delivered just say it just just
[1:47:59] declare it
[1:48:00] i am delivered
[1:48:04] i am delivered i came under an influence
[1:48:07] amen hallelujah it wasn't alcohol it was
[1:48:10] holy ghost
[1:48:11] hallelujah and he showed me that i am
[1:48:14] delivered
[1:48:14] that i am free that i can be married now
[1:48:18] why because all my past got blown down
[1:48:20] all my past
[1:48:22] came under a divine influence and that
[1:48:24] influence wasn't good for my past
[1:48:26] that influence wasn't good for sin that
[1:48:27] ruled in my spirit
[1:48:29] that influence is not good it's for that
[1:48:31] stuff it's good for one thing
[1:48:32] it's good to give god glory it's good to
[1:48:35] give god the praise
[1:48:36] it's good to raise up a standard in my
[1:48:38] life that i may be able to live
[1:48:40] because you see without it all you do is
[1:48:43] struggle
[1:48:45] struggle struggle up and down and
[1:48:49] emotional and
[1:48:50] all of those things until you get
[1:48:52] stabilized
[1:48:54] by the one that can remove your past
[1:48:57] but now we are delivered from the law
[1:49:00] that being dead
[1:49:02] wherein we were held we should serve in
[1:49:04] newness of spirit
[1:49:06] and not in the oldness of the letter
[1:49:11] you see this house who knows whose house
[1:49:14] this is
[1:49:17] yes i don't know if it really is but
[1:49:20] we'll pretend it is still standing they
[1:49:23] call it rahab's house
[1:49:25] hey it probably is god doesn't have
[1:49:28] monuments that fall down when he keeps
[1:49:30] them up all right
[1:49:30] no matter how old it is amen that's your
[1:49:33] testimony
[1:49:34] amen when god gives you a testimony no
[1:49:37] matter
[1:49:37] all the age and all the storms and
[1:49:40] everything of life
[1:49:41] it will remain as a testimony
[1:49:44] amen you see this is the same thing
[1:49:48] rahab and you can identify yourself in
[1:49:50] her
[1:49:51] you see she had a life that she was
[1:49:54] stuck under the law
[1:49:56] of necessity satan's kingdom had bound
[1:50:00] her and coerced her and kept her
[1:50:02] in the life that she lived of ill fame
[1:50:06] it can't do she had to do it she had to
[1:50:08] do it because she had no way of
[1:50:10] income she was supporting all these
[1:50:11] people the devil
[1:50:13] kept her coerced in a sinful state
[1:50:16] and there was no way out and you may
[1:50:19] think tonight
[1:50:20] that there's no way out of your
[1:50:22] condition but you
[1:50:24] can call that thing as a bluff because
[1:50:27] there is a captain come down into your
[1:50:29] land
[1:50:30] amen you see when she was there
[1:50:33] shuttling sterling her she heard the
[1:50:35] stories she heard the stories of the
[1:50:37] bible
[1:50:38] she thought wow this is different
[1:50:40] something real is happening
[1:50:41] i can hear there's a god that's coming
[1:50:43] on the scene there's someone doing
[1:50:45] something real
[1:50:46] i want that no god they didn't hear her
[1:50:51] with a voice or whatever godhead and he
[1:50:54] ordained spies to go to her house he
[1:50:57] ordained that this woman
[1:50:58] who believed him would be free and it's
[1:51:02] the same for you and i think
[1:51:03] it's the same for you and i you can be
[1:51:06] free because remember
[1:51:07] they had a captain come down into their
[1:51:09] land with a sword we've had a captain
[1:51:12] the one that commissioned our prophet
[1:51:14] saying deliver those people
[1:51:16] i believe i'm looking at those people he
[1:51:19] who's been delivered
[1:51:20] and there might be someone tonight that
[1:51:22] needs to be delivered someone that's in
[1:51:24] a babylonian prison tonight
[1:51:26] let's just stand amen just stand with me
[1:51:30] we're going to finish right now but if
[1:51:32] you haven't been delivered
[1:51:34] if you feel like you're in a babylonian
[1:51:36] prison amen
[1:51:38] it's time that you got delivered because
[1:51:40] a word has gone forth
[1:51:41] your spirit does not need to stay dry
[1:51:44] you don't need to have a desert inside
[1:51:46] you
[1:51:46] you can have a garden amen you can have
[1:51:49] a paradise
[1:51:51] amen if there's a desert of this cactus
[1:51:54] whatever it may be then there can be
[1:51:56] flowers
[1:51:57] there can be beauty there can be peace
[1:52:00] and there will be because you have been
[1:52:03] delivered
