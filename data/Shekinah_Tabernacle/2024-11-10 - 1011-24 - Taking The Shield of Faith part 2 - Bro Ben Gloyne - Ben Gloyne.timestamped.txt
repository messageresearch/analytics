[2:25] good
[2:26] morning praise the Lord It's good to uh
[2:29] be here again
[2:32] we were just discussing uh little
[2:34] microphone things and sound things and
[2:38] stuff like
[2:39] that and then we oh that I was just
[2:42] discussing that with brother admand and
[2:43] then our closing sort of remarks were to
[2:46] keep in mind that we're dealing with
[2:47] first world problems
[2:52] here you
[2:56] know there was a time when none of this
[2:59] existed and people people gathered in a
[3:00] field somewhere and someone just
[3:03] preached and they just sang and clapped
[3:06] sang and clapped you know but we thank
[3:08] the Lord that we have these all these
[3:10] modern
[3:11] conveniences and yet we want to want to
[3:13] always just just always be grateful for
[3:16] every everything that we have you know
[3:18] whether it's that or that we just we're
[3:20] always
[3:21] grateful amen
[3:24] um I wasn't I was huming in hariring
[3:27] wither I tell this little little story
[3:30] but I really only get one chance to say
[3:32] it and that's today otherwise it'll be
[3:34] of no uh
[3:37] importance if I say it next week or the
[3:40] week after because it's sort of time uh
[3:42] relevant I
[3:44] suppose can I say it she doesn't know
[3:47] what I'm going to
[3:50] say should I say
[3:55] it I it will take about three minutes
[3:58] hopefully but it I it's just something
[4:00] maybe maybe you'll get a blessing out of
[4:02] it
[4:04] um I'll say a little statement that that
[4:07] that maybe unusual to say here and then
[4:10] I'll explain why I say it and you'll
[4:13] understand as I go on why why why I've
[4:16] said it um because it's going to sound
[4:19] political
[4:20] but I am happy that Donald Trump won the
[4:26] election now hang on hang on hang on
[4:30] no no no hang on hang
[4:31] on now I'm too spiritual to be political
[4:35] okay you you must I'm not not saying
[4:38] that to distance myself you know when
[4:40] we're immature as a child we think a
[4:42] certain way when we mature to an adult
[4:45] we think
[4:46] differently when we're immature and just
[4:48] look at the world naturally we get all
[4:50] political and think that that's where
[4:52] it's at but when we get spiritual we
[4:53] understand we look at it from another
[4:55] dimension so I don't I cannot get caught
[4:58] up in political things it's it's too
[5:00] it's impossible that it goes through my
[5:01] head right so I couldn't it it doesn't
[5:03] excite me this way or that way the the
[5:05] kingdom of God excites me and the spirit
[5:07] of God working that's what excites me
[5:08] and that's the only thing I can latch on
[5:10] to as reality right but nonetheless I
[5:13] don't know if you people don't really
[5:14] know what I've been through in the last
[5:15] sort of 18 months two years but I've had
[5:18] a genuine I've had multiple genuine
[5:22] Devils whether it be the I don't know if
[5:24] it was the main devil but he's got a
[5:25] whole lot of devils around him that that
[5:27] do his bidding but I've had a
[5:30] genuine demonic attack on me for the
[5:32] last two years to just try and
[5:34] completely take me out like done let's
[5:37] take this guy out once and for all you
[5:39] don't know what I've been through man
[5:40] it's been so hard I've never been
[5:42] through anything as hard in my entire
[5:44] life and on the brink of like he's got
[5:47] me I'm planning my demise you know it's
[5:50] but and I'm not making it up like it's
[5:52] been a specific and I've had this for
[5:54] about 5 or 600 days Relentless one day
[5:57] after the other like no no no Rel Le
[5:59] from this demonic stuff and then every
[6:01] which way
[6:02] right uh earlier in the year I sort of I
[6:05] do just keep up with you know current
[6:07] affairs it actually relaxes my mind and
[6:10] I was watching this guy Trump and I'm
[6:13] watching all the stuff that they're
[6:14] throwing at him and a lot of the times I
[6:16] thought man this guy's gone for all
[6:18] money you know look at this next thing
[6:20] they trying to get him with this and
[6:21] that and that I'm thinking man a there's
[6:23] people out there that don't like them
[6:24] and be there trying to do them over
[6:26] whichever way they can and and
[6:29] yeah and when he was in when it was a
[6:32] point where I thought man this guy's
[6:33] this he's done there's no way out of
[6:34] this the at that point I was I'm going
[6:37] through the same stuff and and the Lord
[6:39] said watch what happens to
[6:41] him what what he's going through is what
[6:43] you're going through and watch his
[6:44] outcome it'll be the same as
[6:46] you
[6:48] so so I'm thinking man I hope this guy
[6:50] doesn't get taken out you
[6:53] know so it made me interested in in in
[6:55] what happened to him and even after that
[6:57] it seemed to get worse I'm like man he's
[6:59] gone and that means I'm gone you know so
[7:03] so then on last Wednesday
[7:06] night we the the the election was on and
[7:10] and I usually drive home cuz Shannon
[7:12] gets you know tired sleep so I drive
[7:15] home on the Wednesday night but I said
[7:16] to her could you could you drive home I
[7:18] want to keep up with this cuz I want to
[7:20] see what happens now she was maybe
[7:22] thinking oh he's worri about the
[7:24] election it's like no it's not I just
[7:25] want to see if he wins I'm good if he
[7:27] loses you know
[7:30] cuz CU he's been through all the stuff
[7:31] and yet and so and I think during that
[7:35] drive on Wednesday night it was it was
[7:38] apparent okay this guy's going to win so
[7:40] I'm like okay and I told Shannon this I
[7:43] hadn't mentioned that I'd had this thing
[7:45] but I said look this is what I have been
[7:49] this is what the Lord showed me a while
[7:50] ago and I just have been wanting to see
[7:51] what the outcome is here cuz that's
[7:54] going to be my outcome and so I told her
[7:56] you know in the end I said I'm going to
[7:57] win man I'm going to win this whole
[7:58] thing and um now we we think yeah we I
[8:03] still got one more thing about it we
[8:04] think oh this is uh this is um you know
[8:08] we get these things from the Lord but
[8:10] but the way the Lord speaks to me
[8:11] there's always got to be something else
[8:12] that makes it a bit more reality for me
[8:15] that I'm not just thinking up this stuff
[8:17] you know you want to tell do you want me
[8:18] to tell you a story about trained little
[8:20] children who who who watches uh who
[8:23] reads the Thomas the Tank Engine books
[8:24] you know the the
[8:26] trains I'll tell you a funny story about
[8:28] trains and then I'll go back to the
[8:31] story Shannon and I go most we haven't
[8:35] me as much lately but we have we've got
[8:36] this running track that we do at home we
[8:39] go from our house and up and it's about
[8:41] 5 km and we go to this train bridge then
[8:44] we run back so couple of KS there and a
[8:46] couple of KS back and and um the train
[8:49] bridge actually the we go on a bridge
[8:51] and we go the bridge goes over the train
[8:52] track so the train comes underneath and
[8:55] I don't know why but it it's just been a
[8:59] thing
[9:00] maybe twice a year CU we run we maybe
[9:02] run 200 times or 250 times maybe
[9:04] something like that you know maybe and
[9:06] two times out of those 200 times there's
[9:08] a or 250 times the train will go under
[9:11] the bridge as we get to the bridge we
[9:13] run there and oh there's a train and you
[9:14] see and you stand on the bridge and it
[9:15] goes underneath you it's just something
[9:18] unusual that happens and I I kind of you
[9:21] watch these things in life and I think
[9:22] it's always like I think when that
[9:24] happens I must have I I I reference it
[9:26] to the Lord maybe I've been what have I
[9:28] been thinking today or something cuz it
[9:30] seems to have just an unusual feel to it
[9:33] I feel like there's something
[9:34] significant when we when we sit there on
[9:36] a train goes under like one day I felt
[9:38] like the Marriotts were going to move
[9:39] here are they here this morning no
[9:41] they're not they and I and I I really
[9:44] felt like Bruce Marriot was going to
[9:45] come here I didn't know how it was going
[9:46] to work but he was going to end up here
[9:47] and it was all going to be all right it
[9:49] was just going to work out that way and
[9:51] then that day when we went running the
[9:53] the train came under the bridge I said
[9:55] Ah that's I told you that's confirmation
[9:56] that's going to happen that certain way
[9:58] does that make any sense it's just the
[9:59] funny thing that I do that the Lord sort
[10:01] of and it's only it usually with things
[10:04] that's just I don't know why the Lord
[10:05] does it but that's the way that he he
[10:07] does it like that you
[10:09] know and I told brother Ben about this I
[10:12] said I think bruces are going to come
[10:13] because the train went under the bridge
[10:14] when I was on top of it think you
[10:16] thought I was crazy you know what are
[10:18] you on brother you know are we believing
[10:20] in trains going under a bridge now you
[10:21] know there our
[10:24] confirmation so we're driving home
[10:27] between here and Lavin of course I'm not
[10:29] running but I'm
[10:31] driving and I don't know of many areas
[10:34] where the train is like this but when
[10:36] you drive on a road you usually drive
[10:38] over the train tracks like physically
[10:40] your car drives over the tracks so if
[10:42] you have an issue where if you have a
[10:44] time where you're on top of the train
[10:45] when that happens you're in big trouble
[10:46] means youit got hit by the train so and
[10:49] the other times the trains go over the
[10:52] road like silver stream there aren't
[10:54] many if you think about it like in this
[10:56] whole region where the train where the
[10:58] where the road goes over and the tranger
[11:00] is underneath I can only think of one in
[11:02] this whole region which is between here
[11:04] and
[11:05] lein yeah that's the only one I can
[11:07] think of and I don't I don't know of
[11:08] many others around the country but in
[11:10] this whole low North Ireland that's
[11:11] probably the only one so we're driving
[11:13] home I'm watching this election and I'm
[11:16] saying that he's going to
[11:18] win and I say to Shan you know what if
[11:21] he wins that means I win I'm this the
[11:23] devil's not going to get me in this one
[11:25] I'm going to win no matter what he
[11:26] throws at me I'm going to win cuz
[11:28] because the Lord said that that's what's
[11:29] going to happen and I'm thinking the
[11:31] strong and we're we're driving back and
[11:34] maybe 5 or 10 minutes after that as
[11:35] we're still discussing it we're driving
[11:37] along and then there starts to be a
[11:38] train following
[11:39] us and then we get up to this train
[11:42] bridge where it goes over the
[11:44] road and and when I'm on top of that
[11:47] train bridge what do you think is
[11:49] underneath me Bear Tracks
[11:53] ah a
[11:55] train I'm driving over this train bridge
[11:58] and there's a train underneath me now
[12:00] I've done that TR about a thousand times
[12:03] 500 times there and back I've never had
[12:05] a train under that bridge when I've been
[12:07] on top of it
[12:09] either you think oh there's nothing to
[12:11] that I don't know I think there is I
[12:13] think the Lord's confirming you're going
[12:14] to
[12:15] win and and I'm going to say that to all
[12:18] of you in any situation you're in if you
[12:20] hold on to the word of God you're going
[12:21] to
[12:22] win you you you cannot lose like like
[12:25] the word of God cannot fail so just walk
[12:28] in faith have no
[12:30] doubt you're going to win everything if
[12:32] you hold on to the word of God it can
[12:34] never ever fail no matter regardless of

[34:49] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[34:51] which is the word of God praying always

[35:06] it here it's on the screen but 1 Timothy
[35:08] 1:18 he says this charge I commit unto
[35:11] the son Timothy according to the
[35:13] prophecies which went uh went before on
[35:15] thee that thou might but that by them
[35:19] mightest War a good Warfare holding

[36:30] may you be glorified Lord in Jesus
[36:32] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[36:35] friends you can have your seats this
[36:36] morning so I want to I want to continue
[36:38] on from uh from Wednesday I was talking
[36:42] about the you know we're in this we're
[36:43] in this great battle and and the Apostle
[36:45] Paul when when he would speak about
[36:47] taking the whole armor of God he said
[36:50] above all taking the shield of Faith now
[36:53] he spoke about the other um you know
[36:55] take the helmet and all these things and
[36:57] but but he said above all take the
[36:59] shield of Faith now we need to we need
[37:01] to have an
[37:03] understanding uh how to quench the fiery
[37:05] darts of the enemy now we went over this
[37:07] on Wednesday that it's really the You
[37:09] Know The Enemy um I'm just summarizing
[37:12] then we'll continue on okay so so this
[37:14] is what I'm doing okay so a thought will
[37:16] come a spirit will try and take
[37:18] dominance over your life now it's a
[37:19] fiery Dart now you'll either agree with
[37:21] that and lower your shield and get hit
[37:23] by that fiery Dart or you'll raise up
[37:25] your Shield of Revelation and agree with
[37:28] the Revelation above the D okay so now
[37:31] we're continuing in this thought now
[37:33] it's interesting how how the Apostle
[37:35] Paul would say we wrestle not against
[37:37] flesh and blood now back in the Ephesian
[37:41] age we know that you you the Greek
[37:43] culture was was uh very great under the
[37:45] Roman power and and and they knew what
[37:47] Greek wrestling really was about and so
[37:50] when the Apostle Paul would describe
[37:52] this battle as a wrestling match no
[37:53] doubt their their minds would go to what
[37:55] maybe they had seen with two wrestlers
[37:57] will be wrestling it out and we know
[37:59] wrestling it's not a it's not a distance
[38:01] thing you're you're trying to Grapple
[38:02] your opponent you're trying to find a
[38:04] weak spot maybe you're trying to you
[38:06] know get them in a work them in a
[38:07] certain position then then you can
[38:09] finally pin them but but it it takes
[38:11] strategy it takes time you know it's not
[38:13] a it's not an instant thing but there's
[38:15] a there's a there's a grappling you to
[38:16] you to get hold of your enemy and the
[38:18] enemy wants to get a hold of you and in
[38:20] the Greek times there was one one
[38:22] certain kind of wrestling where where
[38:24] the Victor actually had the right to
[38:25] gouge out the eyes of the loser
[38:28] so they realize now that when they're
[38:30] talking about wrestling this is a
[38:31] serious battle where the enemy wants to
[38:33] pin us down and gudge out our
[38:35] spiritualize that we can see no more
[38:38] this is a serious thing you remember the
[38:39] devil's not playing a game he's not I
[38:41] win let's play again no no he's he he's
[38:44] fighting to destroy but we're fighting
[38:46] to destroy too we're not playing a game
[38:48] amen I mean we're in a real battle but
[38:50] we got to realize that we're wrestling
[38:52] against not flesh and blood but against
[38:54] demon powers and they want to they want
[38:57] to take uh dominion over your life now
[39:01] as we read here in first Timothy that
[39:03] Timothy was told that by the prophecies
[39:05] that went on before him that he by them
[39:07] might fight us fight a good Warfare
[39:09] we're going to realize that we a
[39:11] prophecy has gone before us amen where
[39:13] where John would see the Bride of Jesus
[39:15] Christ in Revelations 19 and there would
[39:17] be a there' be a prophecy of a bride
[39:19] that would be made in the image of the
[39:21] word that would look exactly like him
[39:23] amen that's the prophecy that's gone on
[39:25] before you amen where God sent a message
[39:27] in this end time and when brother Braham
[39:30] saw the preview of the Bride Marching In
[39:32] step with the word he saw you that
[39:34] Vision was a prophecy of your life today
[39:36] amen so by this prophecy we can fight a
[39:39] good Warfare amen so that what is this
[39:41] prophecy you will be victorious amen
[39:44] you'll come out of this age not just
[39:45] surviving but overcoming right and but
[39:48] just like a wrestler a wrestler's got to
[39:50] overcome their opponent right so there's
[39:52] an enemy that wants to pin you on the
[39:54] ground and G you out your eyes but no
[39:56] you're prophesied to gouge his eyes out
[39:58] to pin him on the mat and gudge his eyes
[40:00] out Amen to have a real Victory cuz
[40:03] because the victory Jesus won at Calvary
[40:05] he wants you to be partakers of that
[40:07] Victory and as he knows he's Victorious
[40:11] he wants you to know you're Victorious
[40:13] through
[40:14] him the Lord amen we got to realize that
[40:16] the fiery DTS of the enemy this is this
[40:19] is uh you modern language you could say
[40:21] it's like Vibes it's a spirit that's
[40:23] projecting itself it's not a ay fairy
[40:25] thing it's actually a real thing that
[40:27] wants Dominion now brother R makes a
[40:29] makes a statement in a few places but he
[40:32] says the devil's almost harmless unless
[40:34] he can have something to work in he says
[40:37] you remember those Devils that were cast
[40:39] out of Legion they had they want to do
[40:42] uh some more mischievousness so they
[40:43] wanted to go in them Hogs so the devil
[40:46] must have something to work and somebody
[40:48] to work through so the devil's almost
[40:50] harmless you think about this this this
[40:53] being that thinks he's the king of the
[40:54] world he's the God of this evil age he's
[40:56] made this world like he has the saint in
[40:58] Eden but yet he's almost harmless unless
[41:02] he's got someone to work through so if
[41:04] he's got no one to work through he's
[41:06] almost harmless he's not even you like
[41:08] brother BR one day he woke up and the
[41:10] devil was standing in the corner of his
[41:11] bedroom cackling like a chicken saying
[41:13] I'm going to get you you've got no right
[41:14] with God and he was actually he wasn't
[41:16] afraid he was actually going to wake up
[41:18] his wife and say meet to look at him but
[41:20] then then he thought no that I'll scare
[41:21] her to death so he just rebuked that
[41:23] devil in the name of the Lord and that
[41:25] and and of course he had to leave right
[41:27] because that Devil Couldn't work through
[41:29] the prophet amen he was almost harmless
[41:32] all he could do is threaten right but he
[41:34] couldn't work through him amen and I
[41:37] believe I'm looking at a group of people
[41:39] amen where the devil's almost harmless
[41:41] in their life because we do not give him
[41:43] Avenue to work through us now he may try
[41:46] and he will try because we're human
[41:47] beings right we're just like anyone else
[41:49] but yet by the grace of God a gene seed
[41:52] of predestination we place in our soul
[41:54] amen right but our human makeup we just
[41:56] like any anyone else
[41:58] Hall all right so now he will try so
[42:01] he's almost harmless unless he can get
[42:03] someone to work through now and
[42:06] he and he says he says remember in the
[42:08] Bible when a spirit was cast out of a
[42:10] man they said let us go over into them
[42:12] Hogs they're powerless until they have a
[42:14] place to
[42:15] dwell now I know speak you know I know I
[42:19] can speak for all of us the devil ain't
[42:20] welcome in our lives not even one aota
[42:23] not even one little finger touch he's
[42:25] not welcome anywhere and our private
[42:27] life public life at school our work our
[42:29] job church he ain't welcome the Lord is
[42:32] very welcome the devil's very unwelcome
[42:35] amen so so he is powerless unless he's
[42:37] got a place to dwell now we to realize
[42:39] when when we have all been whether we
[42:41] like it or not we have all been used to
[42:44] fire fiery darts because the devil's got
[42:46] to work through somebody now that
[42:48] doesn't mean we're evil it doesn't mean
[42:50] we're not saved but the devil want if he
[42:52] can get us into a carnal realm then he
[42:55] can start firing shots start getting
[42:57] fired remember because it says in Romans
[42:59] 8:6 for to be kindly minded is death but
[43:02] to be spiritually minded is life and
[43:04] peace amen so when you get annoyed at
[43:06] your brother or sister you're being
[43:08] carnal amen if you just get frustrated
[43:10] at how they are that's carnality you say
[43:13] well then how can I deal with this well
[43:15] you see something that's very human you
[43:18] go to prayer Lord give me wisdom Lord
[43:21] help them touch their life Lord May hold
[43:24] no order against that person because if
[43:26] you start doing that what you're being
[43:27] carnal and then an atmosphere of vibe
[43:30] will go out of you and we'll start to
[43:32] try and drag them down but the whole
[43:33] thing is the devil trying to drag you
[43:34] both
[43:36] down amen he says in James wherewith we
[43:39] bless God even the father wherewith
[43:41] bless uh curse We Men which are made
[43:43] after the Simi of God out of the same
[43:46] mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my
[43:48] brethren these things ought not so to be
[43:51] you say well I've never said I curse
[43:53] this brother I curse this sister but
[43:54] what's your attitude what's your what's
[43:57] your comments about them is it blessing
[44:00] them or is it trying to drag them down
[44:02] oh they've just got to be put in their
[44:03] place God is the one who puts people in
[44:05] their place God is the one that
[44:07] positions people in the body it's not
[44:09] our caral Humanity that's going to put
[44:10] the bride see brother R made a statement
[44:12] when he was talking about Israel and
[44:13] different things he said he said
[44:15] National Force put Israel as a nation
[44:17] back in the promised land he said
[44:19] National Force will put the world C will
[44:21] put the denomination in the world
[44:23] Council of churches but the power of God
[44:26] will put the up into Glory right so it's
[44:28] a very different thing it's not National
[44:30] Force that puts a church together it's
[44:32] the power of God Amen that brings the
[44:34] people together and puts them in their
[44:36] position right so do a fountain send uh
[44:39] send forth uh at the same place sweet
[44:41] and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren
[44:44] bear Olive and Berry um Olive berries
[44:47] either of Vine figs so can no Fountain
[44:49] doth yield salt water and
[44:52] fresh let's
[44:54] bless let's pray let's look at at the
[44:57] best in one another let's not try and
[44:59] drag down one another oh they just
[45:01] immature well what's your maturity doing
[45:03] for them what's your lived example doing
[45:07] for them because remember there may be
[45:09] fiery darts coming your way what are you
[45:11] going to do in
[45:12] response right are you just going to get
[45:15] carnal back at them that means you've
[45:16] been hit and now it's just shots fir
[45:18] everywhere or are you going to let if
[45:20] we're really mature will be spiritually
[45:22] minded and say maybe they you know
[45:25] there's a complex there maybe there's a
[45:26] hurt maybe they're just immature they
[45:28] don't know who they really are yet you
[45:30] know so you got to pray for them oh yes
[45:32] Lord work with them because remember we
[45:34] were all young
[45:35] ones oh I mean a lot of you are still
[45:37] young but the older ones now okay but
[45:39] you can say it all spiritually
[45:41] spiritually we were all young ones toss
[45:43] to and fro the slightest thing you're
[45:45] like man the world's over life's ended
[45:48] it's terrible no but then now you come
[45:50] and you you the Lord stabilizes your
[45:53] walk right and then the same thing
[45:55] happens to you it's just like was that I
[45:57] don't know where where where where bit
[46:00] before that thing almost took you out
[46:03] why because you've matured so you're
[46:04] going to realize we were all spiritually
[46:06] young
[46:07] ones and God had patience and Grace for
[46:10] us and the older ones had grace and
[46:12] patience for us so cannot we have grace
[46:14] and patience for the younger ones
[46:17] remember this bride this bride we must
[46:19] all come to our adopted position in
[46:20] Christ amen every every part of the body
[46:23] will come to its position and that
[46:25] should be our goal when we gather when
[46:27] we pray when we go into this world is
[46:29] Lord this message is an adoption message
[46:32] it's a placing message amen it's more
[46:34] than preachers and deacons and think no
[46:36] every part of the body must come to its
[46:38] position so Lord may I live a life where
[46:40] you can live through me that people will
[46:42] find their position in you amen the Lost
[46:44] will be found the sick will be healed
[46:45] the Wayward will come home amen that
[46:48] people say what's my purpose in life
[46:50] well maybe just the influence of the
[46:51] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost in your
[46:53] life will actually turn on a light bulb
[46:55] in them oh I meant to this this is where
[46:57] I meant to be what did you say well I
[47:00] don't know we just had Fellowship why
[47:02] because it's the Holy Ghost taking over
[47:06] he say well are your words really you
[47:09] know this Vibe thing and it's all little
[47:10] bit vague well Jesus would say the words
[47:13] I speak to you th Spirit of th life so
[47:16] there's a life that was Project now we
[47:17] know that was of course the Holy Ghost
[47:19] right that was God himself right Jesus
[47:21] is his word but your word carries Spirit
[47:24] too right that's why it's far darts it
[47:27] can be fiery darts or it can be healing
[47:29] Dart it can be abama gillad it can be
[47:31] either healing or hurting blessing or
[47:35] cursing amen but you see
[47:37] now there's this wrestling going
[47:42] on now so I'm just driving I I shouldn't
[47:46] be doing this at the same time now
[47:50] remember with wrestling this is the
[47:52] definition of it it wants to the devil
[47:55] wants to pin you down he wants to pin
[47:57] you on the mat now this can appear I'm
[48:00] just being humble no many times just he
[48:02] wants to pin you you know I've heard
[48:04] people say well the Lord allows this
[48:06] besetting sin in my life to keep me
[48:08] humble I think that's the that's the
[48:09] biggest lie you could ever swallow
[48:11] that's nonsense oh cuz I'm like the
[48:14] Apostle Paul he didn't have besing sin
[48:15] by the way you know but they're trying
[48:18] to be all spiritual because they're not
[48:19] willing because they love what is ruling
[48:22] them I no no we should hate every work
[48:24] of the enemy we should not put up with
[48:26] him for s you say well I've been this
[48:27] way all my life today could be a
[48:29] different day you can walk out with a
[48:31] different kind of Life different kind of
[48:32] an attitude I mean with the things
[48:34] that's once beat you down you say how
[48:36] could I ever be free of this yeah I'm
[48:37] just so used to this thing start getting
[48:39] used to Victory start getting used to
[48:42] the word living in your life hallelujah
[48:45] amen so he wants to pin you down wants
[48:46] to take control now many times these
[48:49] things will be will be as I said on
[48:51] Wednesday would be pride unthankfulness
[48:52] and
[48:53] jealousy right and they always run
[48:55] together you do a you look at you look
[48:57] at uh you start from Cain and and and
[48:59] we'll go to him and you go through balum
[49:01] I'm not going to talk about him but
[49:02] different ones it's always pride
[49:04] unthankfulness and jealousy now these
[49:05] are very much fiery Dart especially
[49:07] among religious circles especially among
[49:10] Believers now it's amazing now I know
[49:12] I've shown this picture but I just love
[49:13] the emotion in this picture this is the
[49:15] prodical son now it's amazing you know
[49:18] with because it's amazing what comes out
[49:20] of people when God answers his word when
[49:22] God fulfills his word it's really what's
[49:25] in The Believer comes out it's
[49:27] incredible you know like the scribes and
[49:29] Pharisees what was really in them came
[49:30] out when the word was manifested right
[49:32] in front of them now you take that even
[49:34] down to when prayer is answered now we
[49:36] know that there's a terrible sickness
[49:38] that can uh come around and and it's
[49:40] part of the leosan flu which is the
[49:42] elder brother
[49:44] syndrome it's a it's a mental disorder
[49:47] you know it makes people think the wrong
[49:48] way makes people think not according to
[49:50] the word makes people act not how they
[49:52] should act according to the word but it
[49:54] makes them act uh like an elder brother
[49:57] that's got a syndrome right so now here
[50:00] we are here's here's this picture I know
[50:02] picture uh says a thousand words or
[50:04] whatever so now here's the so so the man
[50:06] in blue he's the younger brother he's
[50:08] come home God has dealt with him so now
[50:11] now they're rejoicing because God has
[50:12] answered prayer don't know how long it
[50:14] took for him to you know the day he left
[50:16] the father's house with his money bag of
[50:18] inheritance the day he came back all
[50:20] broken and and you know in rags and so
[50:22] on we don't know the time frame but the
[50:24] short of it is God answered prayer amen
[50:27] amen one day the Father the father got a
[50:29] hold of the Throne of God and a peace
[50:31] came into his heart saying he's coming
[50:33] home amen so it turned from a I hope
[50:36] he's coming to a I know he's coming so
[50:38] now expectation begin to build maybe the
[50:40] first morning he looked out he's not
[50:42] come you know he's not walking up the
[50:43] path but he's coming right then day two
[50:46] the same thing because it was a
[50:47] revelation am mean the time that maybe
[50:49] it took did not diminish the revelation
[50:51] of his heart because it was more real
[50:53] amen the Revelation he's coming home was
[50:55] more real to the fact that he wasn't
[50:57] even physically there amen so there he
[50:59] was and you know no doubt the elder
[51:00] brother was in those prayer meetings
[51:03] we're going to have a special prayer
[51:04] meeting we got prodal this is the age
[51:06] where prodical are coming home this is a
[51:08] time of full restoration you know maybe
[51:10] the preacher got up and preached those
[51:11] things and you know the father said amen
[51:14] amen that was for me if it wasn't for
[51:15] anyone else that was for me I mean he
[51:17] spoke right into my life he revealed the
[51:19] secrets of my heart and I know this is
[51:21] for me amen they begin to pray they had
[51:23] a pray meting and you know you there was
[51:25] a difference after that one
[51:28] and no doubt you know the elder brother
[51:30] was there but obviously as time went on
[51:33] see but what happened is the elder
[51:35] brother subconsciously begin to compare
[51:38] himself with his younger brother I'm
[51:41] still at
[51:43] home I'm still here I'm a Believer look
[51:46] at all I do I don't tell anyone about it
[51:48] but just but what is he doing he's
[51:50] actually firing
[51:51] darts I'm better than my younger
[51:54] brother where's he gone I don't know oh
[51:57] we got to pray for
[51:58] him but I'm still here look at
[52:02] me what was happening a dart of Pride
[52:05] had come in and it and and it was
[52:07] producing this elder brother syndrome in
[52:10] him and as time went on no doubt he
[52:12] began to compare himself more and more
[52:14] with his younger brother maybe I always
[52:17] knew he'd leave he's just got that
[52:19] nature I just I just I just saw it
[52:21] coming A Million Miles Away you know so
[52:23] obvious when he said to us said to our
[52:25] dad one day I want my inheritance it's
[52:27] so obvious maybe at the time he was
[52:29] shocked but his
[52:32] pride was lifting him up now see if I
[52:35] can see but you see the thing is he
[52:38] became proud and see his identity was
[52:41] actually not wrapped in his position as
[52:44] a son in the house but his identity was
[52:46] the fact that he's better than his
[52:48] brother see we never want to get into
[52:50] that kind of a rut remember a rut is a
[52:53] grave with both ends kicked out okay so
[52:55] we never want it end up in that route
[52:57] I'm better than that one or our church
[52:58] is better than that church or this
[53:00] preacher is better than that preacher
[53:01] you've got an elder brother syndrome
[53:03] you've got a mental deficiency
[53:05] spiritually speaking if you think that
[53:06] way we must never think that way amen
[53:09] God is Sovereign amen he's dealing here
[53:11] he's dealing all around the world the
[53:14] bride is being lifted up into Heavenly
[53:15] places be made in the image of the word
[53:17] amen they may be smaller number they may
[53:19] be greater number in a church it doesn't
[53:21] matter God is dealing around the earth
[53:23] he knows where his seed is and every
[53:25] seed is going to come to it maturity
[53:27] Hallelujah so we must never compare
[53:29] ourselves with ourselves cuz Paul said
[53:31] you become
[53:33] unwise what why why you become unwise
[53:35] because you've come down with an elder
[53:37] brother
[53:38] syndrome right so now he was he was so
[53:43] he he become his identity was the fact
[53:45] that he's he wasn't his uh you know he
[53:47] was better than his brother but then
[53:49] this Pride brought this unth
[53:51] thankfulness because he wasn't dancing
[53:52] and rejoicing with the rest of the
[53:54] family and the servants when when his
[53:57] brother came home he was
[54:00] unthankful and then it even got to a
[54:04] point that when he talked to his father
[54:07] he couldn't even identify with his
[54:09] younger brother he did see notice here
[54:12] he says but as soon as this thy son has
[54:14] come this is the elder brother speaking
[54:16] as soon as thy so he didn't say but as
[54:18] soon as my brother has come no thy son
[54:22] so basically saying I'm not even I can't
[54:24] even identify with this guy and actually
[54:26] he could CU he had an elder brother
[54:27] syndrome his spiritual deficiency was
[54:30] very great he couldn't identify with his
[54:33] own flesh and blood coming back
[54:36] home that's a strange
[54:39] thing but you see he couldn't and you
[54:41] notice
[54:43] now so I'm just I was want to try and
[54:45] stick to my notes for once we'll get
[54:48] there so he couldn't even identify
[54:50] himself with his with his younger
[54:52] brother and then also he wasn't happy he
[54:55] says and he was
[54:58] angry
[54:59] see oh wait this one he couldn't even go
[55:05] in he was angry he couldn't even go in
[55:08] you see so it was pride and then of
[55:09] course that Pride brought an
[55:11] unthankfulness and then it brought a
[55:13] jealousy now this is a very dangerous
[55:16] position to be in because you think
[55:18] about it now here's
[55:20] someone and and and the devil's found an
[55:24] Avenue to try and diminish the power of
[55:26] a testimony you think about this for a
[55:29] second here here the whole church is
[55:32] rejoicing John's come home I'd know
[55:34] whoever his name would be he's come home
[55:37] the thing we've been longing for we've
[55:39] been praying for we've been under
[55:41] expectation for John's come home
[55:43] Hallelujah but here's this guy now
[55:45] what's going to happen shots are start
[55:47] are going to start to be fired right
[55:50] because now jealousy and pride and
[55:51] unthankfulness is going to try and
[55:53] permeate into the rest of the Believers
[55:56] because here he is he's a son he's the
[55:58] eldest son so he's got a position of
[56:00] authority right and the because there's
[56:03] there's the F the father the mother the
[56:05] Elder son whoever else but then there's
[56:07] the servants right so those the servants
[56:09] naturally come under come under the El
[56:12] you come under the older brother and so
[56:14] now shots are going to be fired right
[56:17] pride is going to try and come out and
[56:19] try and diminish what God is doing in
[56:22] their midst right because they're all
[56:25] celebrating but then here comes
[56:27] thunderace with his elder brother
[56:29] syndrome and and what the devil's going
[56:31] to use him to fire darts now to try and
[56:34] to try and take control of the rejoicing
[56:37] the victory in the camp oh
[56:41] my so now and this is what a this is
[56:45] what
[56:46] a this is what the devil
[56:50] does so
[56:53] now the servants now we know the father
[56:55] doesn't put put up with this he corrects
[56:57] him rightly right he's got a because
[57:00] he's got a shield of Revelation I pray
[57:02] this is my Revelation becoming material
[57:05] I mean it was real in my heart now I see
[57:07] it walking here and now he's been
[57:08] restored right but you see now what
[57:10] happens when when a jealous Spirit
[57:12] begins to project itself what it does is
[57:15] is people if they if they lower their
[57:17] Shield of Revelation what happens is
[57:19] those starts hit them and then they
[57:21] begin to Pander to that jealous
[57:23] religious spirit so now what they do is
[57:26] they say well that you know they're
[57:27] still happy for the younger brother but
[57:30] then now they've got to lift up the
[57:31] older brother to Pander to the spirit to
[57:33] try and make it happy what is that
[57:35] that's the result of fiery darts being
[57:38] fired right and what does it do because
[57:40] that jealous spirit will say look at
[57:42] me what about me he says to us if I have
[57:45] it here somewhere you know he says he
[57:48] says no I don't have it on my you in my
[57:50] notes but go read Luke 15 he says I
[57:53] never left I've been here the whole time
[57:55] I've been working hard you''ve never
[57:57] sell you've never you've never you know
[57:59] killed the fatted car for me you know
[58:01] you've never thrown a party for me you
[58:03] I've been here the whole time so what is
[58:04] this this jealousy is
[58:06] projecting and so naturally the servants
[58:09] would play you know because they see how
[58:10] the son the youngest son is they see how
[58:12] the father's reacting to the younger son
[58:15] coming home and they're of course
[58:16] celebrating but then they see how the
[58:18] Elder brother's there so what are they
[58:21] going to do are they going to let those
[58:23] fiery darts hit them cuz you got to
[58:25] realize you can't stop darts firing
[58:27] necessarily of jealousy and pride trying
[58:30] to take but how are you going to react
[58:32] to them amen but you see now to me to me
[58:34] now the the the servants saw what the
[58:37] father said they saw what the word said
[58:41] amen right so they responded according
[58:43] to what the word said amen so what they
[58:46] raised up that Shield of Revelation to
[58:48] say
[58:50] Hey you go be that guy enjoy your elder
[58:53] brother syndrome we'll pray for you it's
[58:55] like you maybe they were in the servants
[58:57] quarters later say Brothers we've got a
[58:59] prayer
[59:00] need you know the younger ones come home
[59:02] but it's brought out what what's in the
[59:04] elder brother we need to pray for him
[59:07] amen he needs to come to a place where
[59:08] he's thankful amen he's not jealous he
[59:11] doesn't he is not full of
[59:13] Pride and they would have had a
[59:15] different kind of a prayer
[59:16] meeting you see so they had a choice
[59:18] they could either they could either
[59:20] Pander they could either Pander to that
[59:23] jealous spirit and lift up the older
[59:25] brother at the same time or they could
[59:28] have held up that Shield of Revelation
[59:30] and quenched those darts and said no I'm
[59:31] going to celebrate
[59:33] because the father is
[59:35] celebrating amen so we must never jeal
[59:38] uh we must never Pander to a jealous
[59:40] Spirit that's allowing that fiery D to
[59:42] hit us because it begins to react in us
[59:45] you know instead of actually just saying
[59:47] praise God God's fulfilled his word amen
[59:50] we've got a time to S this is not
[59:51] another day this is not just another day
[59:53] this is a time to Rejoice amen hallah
[59:56] amen but you see now that that jealousy
[59:59] would try and produce a guilt can you
[1:00:02] imagine now the younger now let's just
[1:00:05] let's just go into here now if I can
[1:00:08] find this we'll go here
[1:00:10] somewhere now when the when the younger
[1:00:13] younger son comes
[1:00:15] home you know he tells his father father
[1:00:18] I've sinned against you and against
[1:00:19] Heaven yeah I'm no worthy to be called
[1:00:21] thy son of course the father's not
[1:00:23] interested in his son becoming a servant
[1:00:24] he's always a son right but the father
[1:00:27] said to his servants put forth the you
[1:00:29] know bring forth the best Rob put it on
[1:00:30] him and put a ring on his hand and shoes
[1:00:33] on his feet now can you imagine now I
[1:00:35] don't know because because Jesus does
[1:00:37] not reveal to us if the elder brother
[1:00:40] actually repented of this foolishness of
[1:00:43] this cality I don't know it doesn't say
[1:00:45] in the Bible but for argument sake what
[1:00:48] if he didn't you know what if he held on
[1:00:50] to it you know because he's so fixated
[1:00:52] on what he has done and what he is doing
[1:00:54] right so for argument sake what if he
[1:00:57] what if he you know was like this
[1:01:00] now as I
[1:01:02] said as I said on Wednesday a jealous
[1:01:06] Spirit like that will try and make the
[1:01:09] person who's who who's received the
[1:01:11] blessing uh try and make them feel
[1:01:14] guilty for what they've received you
[1:01:17] know it's like a you know it's like a
[1:01:18] family you know maybe they've had their
[1:01:20] first child you know maybe they got a
[1:01:21] baby you know and there's a there's
[1:01:23] another couple who maybe can't have a
[1:01:24] child or maybe it's not their time now
[1:01:28] they get jealous there's a jealousy
[1:01:31] saying well that's not fair they've got
[1:01:32] a child instead of rejoicing it's
[1:01:34] amazing you read The Parables you know
[1:01:36] it's all about Rejoice with me you like
[1:01:38] the woman with the coin I got it back
[1:01:40] Rejoice with me everyone you know the
[1:01:41] Shepherd that you know you know goes
[1:01:43] gets the one leaves the 99 gets the one
[1:01:45] it's Rejoice with me see we should
[1:01:47] always act according to the word when
[1:01:48] something good happens Rejoice amen be
[1:01:51] happy amen be happy God's doing
[1:01:52] something see you see you it can be
[1:01:54] you're like a baby comes into a home and
[1:01:57] there's another couple who doesn't have
[1:01:58] a child and there can be fiery darts of
[1:02:01] jealousy the vibe go you know there's a
[1:02:03] jealousy that goes forth to try and
[1:02:05] actually make that mother feel guilty
[1:02:07] that she's holding
[1:02:10] life what are you going to do with that
[1:02:12] I'd say hold up a shield of faith and
[1:02:14] say no no no God gave us this life this
[1:02:17] is this is what God has done in my
[1:02:18] family what he does in your family I'm
[1:02:20] not comparing because I'm not carnal
[1:02:23] right but you can either you either feel
[1:02:24] guilty for life
[1:02:26] or you can say no praise God Lord that's
[1:02:30] up to you I'd say hold up that Shield of
[1:02:31] Faith doesn't matter who it is what they
[1:02:33] do how long fire darts you can quench
[1:02:36] them
[1:02:37] all amen you see now this you know this
[1:02:39] uh elder brother
[1:02:41] here maybe maybe just for argument sake
[1:02:44] this is just me coloring the picture you
[1:02:46] know that because that jealousy loves to
[1:02:47] try and kill the effect of a testimony
[1:02:50] and it loves to try and kill the effect
[1:02:52] wait I'll get there
[1:02:54] eventually and it loves to kill the
[1:02:57] effect of a testimony in the life of the
[1:02:59] one who has the testimony it loves to
[1:03:01] kill the effect in that person so now
[1:03:03] imagine imagine this older brother he's
[1:03:05] still down with this syndrome he won't
[1:03:07] take a bomm of repentance and be be
[1:03:09] healed of it and think straight and then
[1:03:11] so imagine now if he you know comes out
[1:03:13] eventually he sees his younger brother
[1:03:16] and his younger brother's not walking
[1:03:17] like he did when he left he's a
[1:03:19] different man he's been transformed
[1:03:21] God's got a hold of his life and maybe
[1:03:23] you know because this because an elder
[1:03:25] brother the Pride just it's like
[1:03:27] anything whatever's in the heart comes
[1:03:29] forth and then so imagine now if you the
[1:03:31] older brother comes to him and says who
[1:03:34] gave you the right to wear the best robe
[1:03:39] who gave you the right to wear our
[1:03:41] father's ring of authority who gave you
[1:03:44] the right to wear his shoes so you can
[1:03:48] walk like he is walking you dressed like
[1:03:50] he's dressed you got the authority like
[1:03:51] he who gave you the right that's
[1:03:54] jealousy trying to actually oh you know
[1:03:56] try and put a guilt on someone there's
[1:03:58] this Vibe this Spirit going forth trying
[1:03:59] to bring Dominion now the younger
[1:04:02] brother could either feel bad because
[1:04:06] the older one say I know where you went
[1:04:08] I know what you did I've heard the
[1:04:10] stories that's right you haven't changed
[1:04:12] you look the same he's a brand new man
[1:04:15] he's come home the younger brother he's
[1:04:16] been transformed he's wearing a
[1:04:17] different kind of a robe right so now
[1:04:20] the older one could say what right do
[1:04:21] you have to do these things and now that
[1:04:23] younger one could hold either you know
[1:04:25] take those fiery darts and feel guilty
[1:04:28] and actually now have a shame from their
[1:04:30] past or they could rejoice and hold out
[1:04:33] that Shield of Revelation and say it was
[1:04:36] our father that gave me the robe it was
[1:04:39] his word that said you must be robed it
[1:04:41] was his word that says I've given you
[1:04:43] that that ring of authority it's his
[1:04:45] word that says you'll be shot amen with
[1:04:47] shoes like mine that you can walk like I
[1:04:50] walk amen so he could either do either
[1:04:52] one but it's his choice
[1:04:55] amen you know we can't ever appease
[1:04:59] Spirits you can't you can never appease
[1:05:02] a spirit that's like you know i' been
[1:05:04] thinking of Israel recently you know
[1:05:06] they got to a point over a year ago
[1:05:08] October 7th I think it was what whatever
[1:05:11] day you know and they said we're done
[1:05:14] we're done we're not appeasing the world
[1:05:17] anymore we're not appeasing the
[1:05:19] Palestinians anymore we're not appeasing
[1:05:21] the UN anymore we're going to do what
[1:05:24] we're going to do and we're to do it
[1:05:26] until our enemy's done they just got to
[1:05:29] that point because they realize we
[1:05:30] cannot appease this Spirit we cannot
[1:05:32] appease this thing that wants to destroy
[1:05:34] us we're sick of this wrestling match
[1:05:35] we're going to pin this thing on the
[1:05:37] ground that it can't get up amen and to
[1:05:39] me because that's the you know they are
[1:05:41] the natural Israel we're the spiritual
[1:05:43] Israel so I believe we are living in a
[1:05:45] season that we've been in now that we've
[1:05:47] got to a point enough is enough I don't
[1:05:50] care what people say I don't care what
[1:05:52] public opinion says about the word I
[1:05:54] don't care about what the enemy tries to
[1:05:56] say you can't do that what right do you
[1:05:57] have I say no enough is enough amen this
[1:06:01] word will put on flesh he will live in
[1:06:03] my life nothing of my past is going to
[1:06:05] hold me no threats of the enemy are
[1:06:07] going to bind me amen but I'm going to
[1:06:09] walk with God and God's going to fulfill
[1:06:11] his word and woe unto any devil that
[1:06:14] gets in my
[1:06:16] way amen you know it's amazing you
[1:06:19] Israel that you know you know America
[1:06:21] was trying to threaten them stop stop
[1:06:22] doing what you're doing we'll withhold
[1:06:24] weapons they keep doing what they're
[1:06:27] doing no International pressure is going
[1:06:30] to stop them right they're under a
[1:06:33] mandate and we're under a mandate from
[1:06:35] God no pressure of hell's going to stop
[1:06:38] us I mean you may have been wrestling
[1:06:40] for a long time you realize no enough is
[1:06:42] enough am mean I've been I've been given
[1:06:44] the right weapons amen my weapon Supply
[1:06:46] is never going to run to an end and I'm
[1:06:49] sick of the lies of the enemy amen I'm
[1:06:51] going to come out packing total Victory
[1:06:54] hallelujah amen they got to that point
[1:06:55] we got to get to that point
[1:06:58] too amen praise the Lord what am I doing
[1:07:01] here okay all right so
[1:07:04] now praise the Lord are you with me so
[1:07:07] far praise God we're going to continue
[1:07:10] on
[1:07:11] wait it's got to make sure I've got
[1:07:13] everything so we got to hold up that
[1:07:15] Shield of
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:20] Revelation amen you see Cain and
[1:07:23] Abel Cain possessed all three
[1:07:26] unthankfulness jealousy and
[1:07:28] pride he wouldn't see he was not happy
[1:07:31] see before God be to move they would
[1:07:33] have probably G along fine right but
[1:07:36] then when the Lord when the Lord um you
[1:07:39] know be to move on their lives and it
[1:07:41] was by Revelation Abel offered a more
[1:07:43] excellent sacrifice than that of Cain
[1:07:45] right it was by Revelation it was by
[1:07:48] faith that he offered it see Cain Cain
[1:07:51] offered his own good
[1:07:52] works and of course God didn't turn it
[1:07:55] down
[1:07:56] I mean sorry God did turn it down but
[1:07:58] you see now jealousy and contentment
[1:08:00] cannot dwell together this is how you
[1:08:03] can diagnose if someone's jealous they
[1:08:06] cannot be content they can't dwell
[1:08:08] together see jealousy jealousy is never
[1:08:11] happy when someone else does better
[1:08:13] jealousy is always comparing jealousy is
[1:08:15] always saying how do I
[1:08:17] fit we're accepted in the
[1:08:20] Beloved we're accepted Jesus said come
[1:08:23] home we've come home to his word right
[1:08:25] you know he's he's he's opened his arms
[1:08:27] wide just come home just dwell dwell in
[1:08:30] the land of the word of God Amen this is
[1:08:32] you you have a place but you see and
[1:08:34] surely we should be content just from
[1:08:36] those things because even even um you
[1:08:39] know Paul would say in first Timothy he
[1:08:41] says but godliness with contentment is
[1:08:43] great gain you say well I'm content but
[1:08:46] then how do you react when someone else
[1:08:48] does well how do you react when some
[1:08:50] when God blesses another family if
[1:08:52] you're unhappy about it you're jealous
[1:08:55] right but if you're content you're happy
[1:08:56] for them you see so so Cain Cain was not
[1:09:01] Cain was a very jealous man because he
[1:09:04] because he wasn't content you think
[1:09:06] about it you're having church and God
[1:09:08] answered someone's
[1:09:10] prayer this is what happened here God
[1:09:13] answered someone's worship and God came
[1:09:16] down consume the sacrifice if you're
[1:09:18] content in the Lord you you'd be so
[1:09:20] happy for them praise the Lord Brother
[1:09:22] Abel you got a
[1:09:23] breakthrough amen praise God he answered
[1:09:26] your prayer amen the Revelation he put
[1:09:28] on your heart is right look what he's
[1:09:30] done in your life Hallelujah see that
[1:09:31] should be that's contentment right but
[1:09:34] you see Cain wasn't dancing with Abel
[1:09:36] saying praise God praise God we know how
[1:09:37] to Worship in spirit and Truth now no he
[1:09:40] got jealous he got angry he got angry so
[1:09:44] now of course shots are going to be
[1:09:46] fired fiery darts are going to be
[1:09:48] projected right he wasn't even happy see
[1:09:51] see he was he was proud he could not be
[1:09:53] he could not be moved to be changeed to
[1:09:55] the word of God he was unthankful not
[1:09:58] only that God answered Abel's sacrifice
[1:10:02] but he was unthankful God spoke to
[1:10:05] him that's there's no record in Genesis
[1:10:07] that God and the Lord said unto Abel do
[1:10:09] this it was by Revelation in his heart
[1:10:11] right but then after that was all said
[1:10:13] and done and Cain was angry God came and
[1:10:15] spoke spoke to him just do like your
[1:10:18] brother did you'll be accepted he wasn't
[1:10:20] even thankful about that yeah that's
[1:10:23] crazy that's right that's what these
[1:10:24] things do you see but it was the devil
[1:10:26] working through human
[1:10:28] flesh man so he was unth thankful that
[1:10:31] God accepted Abel's lamb and unth
[1:10:33] thankful that God spoke to him to
[1:10:34] correct him and he was too proud to
[1:10:36] Humble himself to what God instructed
[1:10:38] him to do just what your brother did
[1:10:40] maybe he say I'm the oldest you know my
[1:10:42] younger brother's always been a pain we
[1:10:44] should not know each other after the
[1:10:49] flesh David David came to the battle
[1:10:51] where Goliath was his oldest brother
[1:10:53] elab that was bypassed by God to be king
[1:10:56] he said you're just naughty maybe he was
[1:10:58] a naughty boy we were or us boys we were
[1:11:01] all naughty
[1:11:03] once you see you see a four-year-old
[1:11:06] well I can see
[1:11:07] me we were all Naughty Boys once right
[1:11:11] but we've got to have a revelation we
[1:11:12] don't know each other after the flesh we
[1:11:15] must look Beyond see see my greatest joy
[1:11:18] is to see these young ones raised up
[1:11:21] have a real touch from God and then God
[1:11:23] began to move them into their position
[1:11:25] that their for ordained gifting becomes
[1:11:27] fully manifested that's not oh that's
[1:11:29] young son no praise godu that young
[1:11:32] sister that young brother God's moving
[1:11:34] them into their position we need to
[1:11:35] celebrate those things amen we need to
[1:11:38] make room for those gifts cuz they all
[1:11:40] must be manifested they all must be
[1:11:42] displayed amen and that's what the
[1:11:44] message is called to do that's right
[1:11:46] praise the Lord hallelujah amen so now
[1:11:49] so he started firing darts because Cain
[1:11:53] went and spoke to Abel and I doubt very
[1:11:55] much it was a happy conversation wasn't
[1:11:57] a light conversation Cain was Kan was
[1:11:59] and and that demon in him was coming
[1:12:01] full force now Abel had a choice oh
[1:12:05] you're right Cain yes sorry I don't know
[1:12:08] why you'd say sorry but people bowed
[1:12:10] down it's ridiculous what people Spirits
[1:12:12] people will bow down to cuz they feel
[1:12:15] guilty we should never bow never if
[1:12:19] that's your position Kan well God
[1:12:22] revealed this to me God revealed this to
[1:12:25] me Cain it was a lamb I did what the
[1:12:29] Revelation told me to do and God
[1:12:31] Vindicated
[1:12:33] it don't take it up with me take it up
[1:12:36] with God and that's how we should be
[1:12:38] many times people come and this and this
[1:12:39] and this and this well take it up with
[1:12:41] God see the first question should be
[1:12:43] have you prayed about that have you
[1:12:45] actually took that Before the Throne of
[1:12:47] God or are you just actually kindly
[1:12:48] minded and want to keep it very much on
[1:12:50] the earth because if you ever take it up
[1:12:52] to heaven you'll realize actually oh oh
[1:12:55] oh help me Lord instead of deal with
[1:12:58] that guy help me
[1:13:00] Lord you you
[1:13:04] see amen we got a few more we're nearly
[1:13:07] there I think
[1:13:10] now here we are in the
[1:13:12] temple now wait I need to before I
[1:13:15] actually um before I actually read this
[1:13:18] I mean go to that I want to read this
[1:13:19] quote from the church age book he says
[1:13:22] now now this this brother Brown speaking
[1:13:24] about his own Ministry if if you don't
[1:13:25] mind we know all know that this gift in
[1:13:27] my life is Supernatural it's a gift
[1:13:29] whereby the holy spirit's able to
[1:13:30] discern with uh discern diseases and the
[1:13:33] thoughts of men's hearts and other
[1:13:35] hidden things that only God could know
[1:13:37] and then reveal to me I wish you could
[1:13:38] stand with me and see the faces of
[1:13:40] people when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:13:42] exposed now it isn't the people that I'm
[1:13:44] talking about it's that Satan has got a
[1:13:46] hold of their lives through sin
[1:13:48] indifference and
[1:13:49] disease right now we are all subject to
[1:13:52] those things okay but you see the this
[1:13:55] is a wrestling match okay so the devil's
[1:13:57] going to try if he can't use this move
[1:13:59] he's going to use a different move on
[1:14:01] you and if he can't use that move he's
[1:14:02] going to try because a wrestling match
[1:14:04] like I saw some Judo at the Olympics you
[1:14:06] know and there was one person just kept
[1:14:08] um being flipped by the other and they
[1:14:10] were you know but they were just doing
[1:14:12] this basically one move and then
[1:14:13] eventually the other opponent worked out
[1:14:15] how to beat them and then they they won
[1:14:17] the
[1:14:18] bout so there's always there's always
[1:14:20] you know the devil always tries
[1:14:22] different moves so what happens now is
[1:14:25] when is when fiery darts come our way it
[1:14:29] can produce
[1:14:30] indifference and I think indifference is
[1:14:33] the most dangerous one that's right here
[1:14:36] sin unbelief is obvious right he'll try
[1:14:38] and use disease so he'll try and use a
[1:14:40] sickness that comes into our body and
[1:14:42] try and use that to pin us down
[1:14:46] spiritually but then it's indifference
[1:14:48] now indifference actually can come
[1:14:50] because of what other people are
[1:14:52] doing right like the Bible says because
[1:14:55] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:14:57] shall wax cold that's indifference
[1:14:59] coming in right so now here we have here
[1:15:03] we have these two so I just wanted to
[1:15:04] read that there where Jesus would speak
[1:15:06] of the uh the you know there were
[1:15:08] certain uh he said two men went into the
[1:15:11] temple to pray this is Luke 18 the one a
[1:15:13] Pharisee the other a Publican we can see
[1:15:15] the one with his shoes off of the light
[1:15:16] is the Pharisee the other is the
[1:15:18] Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed
[1:15:20] thus for himself God I thank thee I'm
[1:15:22] not as other men are extortion as unjust
[1:15:26] adulterers even as this Publican so this
[1:15:28] guy's got some he's got a real
[1:15:31] problem because he's standing in the
[1:15:33] temple saying I'm
[1:15:35] awesome I am the epitome of the message
[1:15:38] of the
[1:15:39] hour look at me I've got all the quotes
[1:15:41] all the all the buckles all the things
[1:15:43] look at me I've been to all the sites
[1:15:46] I'm better than everyone else you ever
[1:15:48] get that near your mind you're in
[1:15:49] Dangerous Grounds right the great one in
[1:15:52] our midst is not any mortal it's him
[1:15:56] it's the Lord Jesus he's the great one
[1:15:58] but this Pharisee he came in said look
[1:16:00] I'm awesome I'm better than this guy
[1:16:02] that's for sure I fast twice in the week
[1:16:05] I give ties of all I possess and the
[1:16:07] Publican standing a far off could not
[1:16:08] lift up as much his eyes unto heaven but
[1:16:10] smote upon his breath saying God uh
[1:16:13] breast God be merciful to me a sinner I
[1:16:15] tell you this man went down to his house
[1:16:17] Justified rather than the other for
[1:16:19] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[1:16:21] a base and he that humbleth him himself
[1:16:23] shall be exalted so here are these two
[1:16:27] here are these two now darts of Pride or
[1:16:30] the influence of Pride from from one
[1:16:33] who's proud can cause an indifference in
[1:16:36] people around them right because you
[1:16:39] look at the one who's got his shoes off
[1:16:40] he's you know saying how awesome he is
[1:16:42] see pride cannot lift up someone else a
[1:16:45] proud Spirit can never extend Mercy it
[1:16:48] can never Mercy can never be extended
[1:16:50] through pride pride can never you look
[1:16:53] at the Devil there's no mercy in the guy
[1:16:56] and and and here's the epitome of Pride
[1:16:58] self-importance but you see pride so
[1:17:00] Pride can never be extended through
[1:17:02] Mercy it only lifts up the one who's
[1:17:05] proud and pushes down and controls the
[1:17:06] one who's
[1:17:08] not so this guy is shooting darts of
[1:17:12] indifference right Pride which which can
[1:17:14] produce an indifference why is it
[1:17:16] indifference because it's indifference
[1:17:18] because those who those who look at the
[1:17:20] one who's proud they say I can never
[1:17:22] become like that guy
[1:17:25] I can never become like my family can
[1:17:27] never be like that family I can never be
[1:17:29] like that kind of a Believer and what's
[1:17:31] actually happened is they've come under
[1:17:32] the control of that proud Spirit but it
[1:17:35] doesn't make them proud it makes them
[1:17:37] indifferent because they look at they
[1:17:38] look at this person like like this
[1:17:40] Publican for example if he looked up at
[1:17:42] him said man I can never be that guy
[1:17:44] what's the point in trying but I'm a Jew
[1:17:46] I'm an Israelite so I'll come to church
[1:17:47] you know because this is who we are but
[1:17:49] it will produce an
[1:17:51] indifference so we must never we got to
[1:17:53] hold up our Shield of Revelation amen
[1:17:56] amen God you've called me you've saved
[1:17:59] me I'm your
[1:18:00] child amen irrespective Lord my walk is
[1:18:03] with you not with someone else right I I
[1:18:07] want to look in the mirror of your word
[1:18:08] Lord and not in the mirror of Pride amen
[1:18:11] because because that Pharisees basically
[1:18:13] you know he holds up the wrong
[1:18:17] mirror he's looking at himself saying
[1:18:19] I've made it but then he'll come to a
[1:18:21] stage in his life where he'll be
[1:18:23] miserably disappointed
[1:18:25] cuz he realized the mirror he's looking
[1:18:26] into is not the mirror of the word to
[1:18:28] match the word he's looking to the
[1:18:30] mirror of what he thinks the word should
[1:18:32] be so now so these two in the temple now
[1:18:37] so for example as I said earlier now you
[1:18:39] take so how can we now how can we combat
[1:18:43] these things because I I've you I've
[1:18:46] spelled out a lot of examples and you
[1:18:48] know different scenarios and things now
[1:18:50] how can we how can we combat these
[1:18:52] things
[1:18:55] we must never get
[1:18:56] carnal right we must never respond how
[1:18:59] it's given this is not tit fortat this
[1:19:02] is not eye for eye tooth for truth this
[1:19:03] not how this thing works otherwise you
[1:19:05] just continue a cycle that's been
[1:19:07] happening for seven Church ages right
[1:19:10] the cycle of fussing fighting stewing
[1:19:12] splitting arguments all these things
[1:19:14] Strife carnality there must come a time
[1:19:16] and now is that that cycle must be
[1:19:19] broken amen but it will only be broken
[1:19:22] by people who withstand that thing and
[1:19:24] say I will not let the devil work in me
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:29] amen praise the Lord like you take for
[1:19:31] example you know yeah like a young
[1:19:33] Christian brother sincere he thinks he's
[1:19:35] great a real example of a
[1:19:37] Believer right you know but does he help
[1:19:40] around church now I'm not talking to you
[1:19:42] I'm just using an example right so
[1:19:44] someone who thinks they're the epitome
[1:19:45] of the message young guy okay he thinks
[1:19:48] he's awesome does he help around Church
[1:19:50] does he actually lift a finger and help
[1:19:52] the body no
[1:19:55] but then when you put he's as quiet as a
[1:19:56] church mouse he won't even lift a finger
[1:19:59] for anything but as soon as you put a
[1:20:01] microphone in his hand it's like he
[1:20:02] comes
[1:20:06] alive that guy needs to go through some
[1:20:09] things he needs to really know the grace
[1:20:11] of God he's got to realize it is God and
[1:20:14] not him right but you see we see people
[1:20:19] but the thing is that those ones are
[1:20:21] just going through a
[1:20:23] stage right now we have a choice because
[1:20:26] there's now A vibe there's a there's a
[1:20:27] spirit being projected through that I'm
[1:20:30] awesome but then what happens is now you
[1:20:32] can either hold up your Shield of
[1:20:33] Revelation and say Lord I was there
[1:20:37] once just like let's be honest we were
[1:20:39] all legalistic
[1:20:42] once amen okay we were with oh no I
[1:20:46] never was yeah you were everyone goes
[1:20:48] through that face some people stay in
[1:20:51] that face but it's better when you go
[1:20:52] through the face and enjoy the goodness
[1:20:54] of of God right but we were all that
[1:20:56] stage but you see now there's a choice
[1:20:58] that the more spiritually mature could
[1:21:00] make they can either drop that Shield of
[1:21:03] Revelation and let that fiery doubt hit
[1:21:05] them and then they start pushing down
[1:21:08] start condescending start trying to push
[1:21:11] that young one out of the
[1:21:13] church that's the bad choice by the way
[1:21:16] okay see you got to look at how am I
[1:21:18] responding to the situation that really
[1:21:20] shows you whether you've lifted up the
[1:21:22] shield of Revelation or you've been hit
[1:21:23] by the D
[1:21:25] okay it's it's your reaction okay so if
[1:21:27] your reaction is man this guy's got to
[1:21:29] fall into line he's got to pull his
[1:21:31] weight he's got to do and you push him
[1:21:33] down condescend all these things you've
[1:21:35] been hit by a dart but then now if you
[1:21:38] hold up that Shield of Revelation and
[1:21:40] you realize Lord I was there once Lord
[1:21:43] this is all part of his journey Lord I'm
[1:21:45] thankful you're working his life Lord
[1:21:46] I'm thankful Lord he wants to be here he
[1:21:49] wants to serve you and then what do you
[1:21:51] do you create an
[1:21:53] atmosphere amen create an atmosphere
[1:21:56] which which causes them to come under
[1:21:57] the influence of the Holy Spirit where
[1:21:59] you can teach them a more excellent
[1:22:02] way
[1:22:04] amen see brother Ram says now surely
[1:22:07] after all these years uh on the field
[1:22:09] and around the world and seeing
[1:22:10] different people I ought to know a
[1:22:12] little bit about the gate to enter and
[1:22:13] out and if you want to get somewhere
[1:22:15] with God never let an arrogant Spirit
[1:22:17] ever come around you I mean don't let No
[1:22:19] Malice come in no matter what anyone has
[1:22:22] done if if they are wrong don't you
[1:22:25] never build a complex against that
[1:22:26] person see complex is building up
[1:22:28] against someone is because a fire darts
[1:22:30] hit
[1:22:31] you right see you be sweet and kind
[1:22:34] remember God loved you when you in sin
[1:22:36] and if the spirit of God is in you you
[1:22:37] love the other person when he is in
[1:22:39] wrong see just pray for them and love
[1:22:42] one another that's right that's the
[1:22:45] great
[1:22:46] secret amen
[1:22:48] now I'm just going to close with these
[1:22:51] thoughts
[1:22:52] here Satan wants to pen us on the
[1:22:56] mat but you see the church has a hidden
[1:22:59] power the Bride of Jesus Christ has a
[1:23:02] hidden power Amen brother Brown would
[1:23:04] say you know wrestlers you know they
[1:23:05] practice on breaking toe holes and
[1:23:07] things but you can't break these toe
[1:23:08] holes speak about the devil no could you
[1:23:10] imagine a wrestler that came out M with
[1:23:12] his fingernails polish trunks on all
[1:23:13] kinds of gold beads around it looks like
[1:23:15] a pretty good wrestler but if it's only
[1:23:17] intellectual if he hasn't got a hidden
[1:23:19] strength there that when the when his
[1:23:21] enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can
[1:23:23] pull out of it his intellectual beads
[1:23:25] around him and everything won't make
[1:23:27] much difference am mean so is all our
[1:23:29] intellectual means nothing if there
[1:23:31] isn't the hidden power of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:33] there you see this is the power that
[1:23:34] will break the wrestling match I mean
[1:23:37] there's a hidden power I mean that's in
[1:23:39] the believer that the devil doesn't
[1:23:40] realize it's there I mean you take
[1:23:42] Samson for example he was bound a
[1:23:44] thousand Philistines were in front of
[1:23:46] him saying we're going to kill him we're
[1:23:47] going to take him and make fun of him
[1:23:49] amen but he had a hidden power Amen to
[1:23:51] break those bands remember those bands
[1:23:53] were put on him not not from the enemy
[1:23:55] but from his own Israelites I mean from
[1:23:57] his own country and they said they said
[1:23:59] look the the Philistines are going to
[1:24:00] get us why they were they were so much
[1:24:02] fear was projected through them that
[1:24:05] they said let's bind up this Champion
[1:24:07] let's try and keep the status quo as it
[1:24:09] always should be I say no enough is
[1:24:11] enough I mean we should never God begins
[1:24:13] to move in someone's life let's rally
[1:24:15] around God moving I mean they should
[1:24:17] have rallied around Samson but they
[1:24:19] bound up the one that was sent to
[1:24:20] deliver them I me but you see Samson had
[1:24:23] a hidden power Hallelujah that even the
[1:24:25] Israelites didn't know where it came
[1:24:26] from but there was a Nazarite vow he was
[1:24:28] born under and he was living according
[1:24:30] to and then when the enemy shouted
[1:24:31] against him it said the spirit of God
[1:24:33] Came Upon him and he broke that toe ho
[1:24:35] hold to the enemy and he slew a thousand
[1:24:37] with a Jawbone of an ass why because he
[1:24:39] had a hidden power amen that can break
[1:24:42] any SE see there's a promise of God that
[1:24:45] can break any hold on any devil at any
[1:24:49] time amen Jesus our lord proved it when
[1:24:52] he was uh that he was Emanuel God
[1:24:54] himself made flesh Among Us and when he
[1:24:56] met Satan to show that Satan could be
[1:24:58] defeated by the word every time Satan
[1:25:00] would come to him say it is written it's
[1:25:03] written amen he says see what is this
[1:25:06] hidden power that's what the church
[1:25:08] today they've got a hidden power oh
[1:25:10] something that fortifies him what is
[1:25:12] it's the word the manifestation of God's
[1:25:15] grace with his people amen that's the
[1:25:18] hidden power that we have that's the
[1:25:19] manifestation of God God's grace with
[1:25:21] his people what is that manifestation
[1:25:23] that's the fulfillment of the word today
[1:25:27] in our midst amen not just back in the
[1:25:29] prophet's Ministry no that same word
[1:25:31] that same Pillar of Fire is here today
[1:25:34] confirming his word it's a manifestation
[1:25:36] of God's grace what was Camp a
[1:25:38] manifestation of God's grace I mean what
[1:25:40] of Our Lives they're a manifestation of
[1:25:42] God's grace and it's a hidden power that
[1:25:45] you possess am mean that when the enemy
[1:25:47] is trying to pin you down by firing
[1:25:49] darts you feel indifferent you feel
[1:25:50] resentful you feel Kindel you feel angry
[1:25:53] at someone you build a complex you've
[1:25:54] got a hidden power that can break that
[1:25:57] Toe Hold amen you've got that hidden
[1:25:59] power because they call on God say God I
[1:26:01] don't want to feel this way against my
[1:26:02] brother and sister God I don't want to
[1:26:04] feel this way against the word I don't
[1:26:06] want to feel this way against this
[1:26:07] church Lord Lord break this hidden power
[1:26:09] I don't want to be indifferent anymore

[1:26:23] Lord I want to see it come come out oh
[1:26:24] God I want to see it Liv in my life Lord
[1:26:26] Jesus that when the enemy comes against
[1:26:28] me he's going to be pinned on the ground
[1:26:30] and he's going to stay on the ground and
[1:26:32] he's going to keep staying on the ground
[1:26:34] why because I've allowed that hidden
[1:26:35] power Amen to take control of my life
[1:26:40] hallelujah hallelujah that's what you've
[1:26:42] got to do you got to let that hidden
[1:26:44] power of the Holy Ghost take Dominion

[1:41:50] Christ um
[1:41:53] as brother Isaac was sharing this
[1:41:54] morning it just you
[1:41:58] know struck something in my heart I I I
[1:42:01] didn't want to miss the opportunity to
[1:42:03] share uh this week was a hard week for
[1:42:06] me um in in My Flesh and myself as a man
[1:42:12] um but I know I had the answer about 8
[1:42:15] months ago when my Deacon and my pastor
[1:42:17] prayed for me that I shouldn't have
[1:42:20] nothing to worry about but in our flesh
[1:42:23] we do we do think about these things and
[1:42:27] I was going through a a trial in my life
[1:42:30] and the devil came and he threw his DTS
[1:42:32] upon me and he made me
[1:42:35] doubt and after I got prayed yes
[1:42:40] everything was forgotten about I didn't
[1:42:41] worry about it but a A letter came home
[1:42:44] from the hospital and they're going to
[1:42:47] call me up for a for a meeting and then
[1:42:51] it was there for a few months and I
[1:42:52] didn't worry about it and I've forgotten
[1:42:53] about it again and just before Camp a
[1:42:56] week before Camp I get a phone call from
[1:42:58] the hospital telling me that um yeah I
[1:43:01] need to come in they got a date set for

[1:43:16] fact that they called me in for the
[1:43:18] procedure
[1:43:20] um I was concerned
[1:43:23] and I brought it back to the Lord in
[1:43:25] prayer but still in my Humanity I I I
