[35:46] the Living God is among you that he will
[35:48] without fail drive out from before you
[35:50] the Canaanites and the Hittites the
[35:52] hivites the pites the gites the amorites
[35:55] and the jebusites behold the Ark of the
[35:58] Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth
[36:00] passeth over before you into Jordan
[36:03] praise God and we just go to Mark 16 and
[36:05] from verse 14
[36:08] down and it
[36:11] um reads like this here says and
[36:15] afterward he appeared unto the 11 as
[36:17] they sat at meat and upgraded them with
[36:20] their unbelief and Hardness of Heart
[36:22] because they believed not them which had
[36:24] seen him after he was risen and he said
[36:27] said unto them go ye into all the world
[36:28] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[36:30] he that believeth in is baptized shall
[36:32] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[36:34] damned and these signs shall follow them
[36:36] that believe in my name shall they cast
[36:38] out Devils they shall speak with new
[36:40] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[36:42] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[36:44] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[36:46] the sick and they shall recover so then
[36:48] after the Lord had spoken unto them he
[36:50] was received up into heaven and sat on
[36:52] the right hand of God and they went
[36:54] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[36:56] working with them and confirming the
[36:58] word with signs following amen praise
[37:02] the Lord let's bow our heads in a word
[37:03] of prayer this morning amen if you want
[37:05] to be remembered am we don't do it as a
[37:06] tradition but you want to remember just
[37:07] raise up your hand slip your hand up say
[37:09] Lord Remember Me this moment gracious
[37:11] father as we bow our heads Lord in your
[37:13] great divine presence Lord we're so
[37:15] thankful that we can call Upon Your
[37:16] Great Name because of your shed blood
[37:18] Lord God you broke down that middle wall
[37:20] of partition between us and you Lord
[37:22] that we can have fellowship with you
[37:23] Lord walk with you talk with you we so
[37:25] appreciate that Lord we love you through
[37:27] all our our hearts today Father we ask
[37:28] that your blood would cover us all this
[37:30] day Lord may you anoint speaker and
[37:32] hearer Lord may you be glorified in our
[37:34] midst father glorified in our lives
[37:36] father and you see the hands that have
[37:37] been raised the needs behind those hands
[37:39] Lord I pray you'd meet them for your
[37:40] great Lord glory and may you bless those
[37:42] who couldn't be here as well Lord those
[37:44] who are streaming be with them Father
[37:46] this day in Jesus Christ's name amen
[37:50] amen God bless you you can have your
[37:51] seats this morning so I want to speak
[37:53] about the True Church of the Living God
[37:55] this morning now I just want to get off
[37:58] the bat right away that the True Church
[37:59] of the Living God is made up of
[38:01] individuals it's not by going to a
[38:03] church building that you're saved it's
[38:04] that you know Christ you're under his
[38:05] shed blood His Holy Ghost is in you
[38:07] that's the True Church of the Living God
[38:09] Amen but I just want to come back here
[38:11] to this thought where where Joshua said
[38:13] that this is how you shall know that the
[38:15] Living God is among you now make this
[38:17] personal okay make the service personal
[38:19] don't make it as a collective amen
[38:21] because we're not here as a collective
[38:23] because when all is said and done it's
[38:25] it'll be you standing before the Lord
[38:27] right so take this as an individual
[38:29] thing right so this is how you shall
[38:31] know that the Living God is among you
[38:33] that he will without fail drive out
[38:35] every enemy in the land amen every enemy
[38:38] in your life will be cast out will be
[38:40] defeated this is how you shall know that
[38:42] the Lord is among you that you will go
[38:44] from Victory to victory that ultimately
[38:46] you will win the war okay this is this
[38:49] is how we know that God is with us
[38:51] because if we look back at our lives we
[38:53] can see what we were a year ago we're
[38:55] not now because God has taken us from
[38:57] Glory to glory amen sure we're been
[38:59] through trials and battles Joshua and
[39:02] the and the children of Israel went
[39:03] through some hard trials and hard
[39:05] battles but God was with them and they
[39:07] drove out the enemy without fail they
[39:09] won now we know and we um that that they
[39:12] had defeats along the way right so we
[39:15] take for example where where aen had
[39:18] where uh when they were getting all the
[39:19] spoils out of Jericho that he saw that
[39:22] golden wedge that um Babylonian garment
[39:24] and before they went in they were
[39:26] commanded not take anything for
[39:27] themselves but bring it to the
[39:28] Tabernacle of the Lord and so when they
[39:31] but but he did this in secret out of his
[39:33] own selfishness and what happened is
[39:35] when they went to fight AI they lost
[39:37] they lost I think 36 men and Joshua
[39:40] Joshua called a halt of the whole
[39:42] campaign because he knew something's
[39:44] wrong here they weren't meant to lose a
[39:46] man because God said without fail you're
[39:47] going to win every battle so they lost
[39:49] the battle so they said hey something's
[39:50] wrong right so they cast lots we know
[39:53] ultimately it came down to aen and Ain
[39:55] confessed and and and so so this was it
[39:58] seemed to be a defeat but you got to
[39:59] realize that I say that demon of AI sat
[40:02] there until Israel came and destroyed it
[40:05] right so the enemy you may you may lose
[40:07] a battle but you're going to win the war
[40:09] I mean just because you lose a battle
[40:11] doesn't mean the whole campaign's a
[40:12] failure it doesn't mean your Christian
[40:13] walks out of failure no God wants to
[40:15] teach you something in that failure but
[40:18] you've got to look for him to teach you
[40:19] in that moment right so it's like you
[40:21] know we've got to always realize that
[40:22] we've been predestinated to win amen we
[40:26] are Overcomers we are are not defeated
[40:28] we are victorious in Jesus Christ amen
[40:30] so here we are standing in this moment
[40:33] and but I'm so thankful that you know
[40:35] sure we're going to talk about casting
[40:36] out devils and all these things today
[40:38] and having having dominion over Satan
[40:40] but we got to realize that as Jesus
[40:42] would say to his disciples when they
[40:43] came back after um going on a healing
[40:46] campaign and they were rejoicing saying
[40:48] that even the devils are subject to us
[40:49] he said don't rejoice in those things
[40:51] but Rejoice that your names are written
[40:54] in heaven amen so there's a greater
[40:56] thing really Among Us it's not the fact
[40:58] that God lives and miracles are done
[41:00] those things are wonderful it's a proof
[41:01] that God's among us but it's not the
[41:03] proof I mean the proof is that God has
[41:05] lined us up with his word made us new
[41:07] creatures in him and the fact that he's
[41:08] done that because we can recognize our
[41:10] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[41:11] Life before the foundation of the world
[41:14] and this is why this message has come
[41:15] for to reveal the names in the book amen
[41:18] and that's why it's changed your life is
[41:20] because God gave you the Revelation your
[41:22] name was written before the foundation
[41:23] of the world by the blood of the lamb
[41:26] and nothing the devil can do can rub
[41:27] your name off his book amen so you can
[41:29] stand Victorious though you may feel
[41:31] defeated you're not defeated you will
[41:33] win the day amen so you got to realize
[41:35] that friends that this word has opened
[41:37] up and shown us into eternity that we
[41:39] came from God went back to God you
[41:41] didn't come here haphazardly you're not
[41:43] a Christian haply no God ordained you
[41:45] before the foundation of the world Amen
[41:47] you may have been raised in church but
[41:49] there was a day when the light went on
[41:51] and when the fire of God fell upon your
[41:53] life amen hallelujah and that's where
[41:55] we're going to realize that you were not
[41:57] an accident you were purposed here amen
[41:59] your purpose here is to overcome as
[42:01] brother Isaac preached about vengeance
[42:03] that there is a day now where every
[42:05] enemy will be under the feet of the
[42:07] children of God Amen we're not just
[42:09] waiting for victory in the Millennium
[42:11] it's now God wants to prove his blood
[42:13] now amen he wants to prove Calvary works
[42:16] now in face of every opposition every
[42:18] enemy God wants to prove his word today
[42:22] amen that when we walk out of here and
[42:24] we go up into Glory we're carrying
[42:26] spoils we're carrying testimonies of
[42:29] what God has done in our lives amen
[42:32] we're carrying trophies amen we're
[42:34] carrying victories amen and we when we
[42:36] get up there that day we'll lay lay them
[42:38] at his feet say Lord you actually won
[42:40] the victory but you Lord by your grace
[42:42] allowed me to stand there and watch you
[42:44] defeat my enemies Hallelujah CU you put
[42:47] something in my heart that I'm not
[42:48] willing that an enemy lives in my life I
[42:51] want them all gone I want them dead I
[42:53] want them defeated hallelujah hallelujah
[42:56] you put that in my life you put he put a
[42:58] grit in you that you didn't even realize
[43:00] you
[43:02] had hallelujah hallelujah friends we're
[43:05] living in a different season am mean
[43:08] we're not living in a season of just
[43:09] churchianity and Christianity no we're
[43:11] living in a season where God's word is
[43:13] put on flesh amen he's determined that
[43:16] he's going to have a people that that
[43:18] that people don't need to read this they
[43:20] read you and when they see you they see
[43:23] this amen every facet of your life they
[43:26] see this manifested I mean what the
[43:28] Apostle Paul described as a housewife as
[43:31] a husband as a child as a brother as a
[43:34] minister you're living it and it's not
[43:37] you living it it's he you allowed him to
[43:41] live amen maybe we just ditch this
[43:44] now but we're living in the season
[43:47] friends you got to realize oh had maybe
[43:50] had some bitter failures don't wallow in
[43:52] your failure don't wallow in the defeat
[43:55] and the all and the what could be of
[43:57] Life get up get up and keep walking get
[44:00] up and keep
[44:02] marching amen cuz it says in Proverbs
[44:04] here lay not wait a wicked man against
[44:06] the dwelling of the righteous spoil not
[44:08] his resting place for a just man falleth
[44:11] seven times and Rises up again
[44:15] Hallelujah so just
[44:17] personal you you're the Devil May
[44:20] literally get your face in the mud and
[44:22] trot on you a while but you're not
[44:23] staying there amen you may feel
[44:26] convicted condemned lost whatever but
[44:28] you're not staying there cuz there's
[44:30] something in the believer that wants to
[44:31] get back into the presence of God Amen
[44:34] Peter felt absolutely defeated amen
[44:36] because remember he stood there and told
[44:38] the Lord Lord I'll not deny you remember
[44:40] we preached last last Sunday about being
[44:42] offended and the Lord said you're going
[44:44] to be offended because of because of me
[44:46] this night Peter looked at him and said
[44:47] I ain't I'm the special case Lord your
[44:51] word doesn't apply to me friends never
[44:53] get to the place where you think that
[44:54] you're the exception to the rule there
[44:56] are no sub Clauses in this word there
[44:58] are no sub Clauses in this word that
[45:00] that make you a special case no if
[45:02] you're in a walk with God you stay with
[45:04] his word the devil wants you to think
[45:06] that you're a special case and it
[45:07] doesn't apply to you I'm sorry the word
[45:09] applies to
[45:11] everyone that terms and conditions that
[45:13] change these things so but Peter thought
[45:15] he was a special case because he had the
[45:17] grit he was a Burly fisherman and he was
[45:19] rugged and he could do it and the Lord
[45:21] said no no before the crows you're
[45:24] going to deny me three times he did
[45:27] agree with the Lord he didn't say Lord
[45:28] spare me from this humiliation and this
[45:30] defeat no he disagreed with the word
[45:33] because of his own Pride because of who
[45:35] he was he was in the Inner Circle man he
[45:37] was one of the top three disciples he
[45:39] had the keys to the kingdom all these
[45:40] things and he thought he was something I
[45:42] tell you friends if God lifts his finger
[45:45] just a little bit off our lives we're
[45:47] done we need him to keep us in the palm
[45:50] of his hand remember we're engraved in
[45:52] his hands but we don't we never want to
[45:54] get to a point we say now I can do it I
[45:57] can walk this walk I've matured and I'm
[45:59] all these things we must never get to
[46:01] that place I mean I believe the more
[46:03] mature we get the more we realize we
[46:05] need him I mean the more we depend upon
[46:07] him to me that's a that's a great side
[46:09] of maturity Lord I need you more more
[46:12] than yesterday more than words can say
[46:13] Lord I need you more and then so Peter
[46:15] went through his great trial where he's
[46:18] warming himself by the fire as Jesus is
[46:20] on trial when Jesus needed him and and
[46:23] then a woman comes
[46:25] along down the days of Israel a witness
[46:28] of a woman was the lowest thing that
[46:30] stood in court and so here comes a woman
[46:33] aren't you one of them aren't you one of
[46:36] them and and he he denies no and then
[46:40] another one comes along and then the
[46:42] third one says but even your speech
[46:44] betrays that you're a Galilean he had
[46:46] that Galilean accent that twang or
[46:48] whatever was going on right and so but
[46:50] but then he even cursed denying the Lord
[46:53] the last time just to you know make a
[46:54] effect I don't even know this guy
[46:56] whatever he said
[46:57] at that moment he heard the
[46:59] Crow he knew he failed miserably his
[47:03] good intentions made him defeated we
[47:06] can't go by Good Intentions friends we
[47:08] got to go by the word of God you see and
[47:10] then so there he is defeated he's failed
[47:13] but then when the Lord rose he says go
[47:16] tell my disciples and
[47:18] Peter see there was something in Peter
[47:22] though he has fallen I'm going to get
[47:25] I'm going to rise but he didn't know if
[47:28] he would be received in the rising but
[47:30] you see at the rising of the sun when
[47:31] they're fishing and of course you know
[47:33] that was Peter's idea I go fishing the
[47:35] other said well we'll go with you failed
[47:37] miserably at their old profession and
[47:39] then one of them you know you they see a
[47:40] figure on the seashore have you caught
[47:43] any
[47:44] fish oh my you don't tell you you don't
[47:46] ask a frustrated fisherman if he's got
[47:50] anything that's right but then of course
[47:52] he says no and then John John with a eal
[47:55] vision going to look beyond what Peter
[47:57] can see says it's the Lord amen and I I
[48:00] probably missed out some details of the
[48:01] story but the M but the thing is when
[48:03] Peter realized it was the Lord he put on
[48:06] his fish's coat he jumped in the water
[48:07] and he started swimming he didn't wait
[48:09] for the boat and all these things he
[48:10] just said I've got to get into his
[48:12] presence I've got to I've got to get
[48:14] back to where I was that's right and he
[48:17] didn't know if he'd be received or not
[48:18] but there's something within the
[48:20] believer Lord you'll you'll take me back
[48:23] somehow Hall and you know the rest of
[48:25] the story he was restored in all these
[48:26] things but you see though though we fall
[48:29] we will not be cast down so don't wallow
[48:33] and defeat
[48:35] rise because even it would say in Hosea
[48:39] now now achen was achen was stoned in
[48:42] the valley of aor and so saying Hosea
[48:45] therefore behold I will Allure her and
[48:47] bring her into the Wilderness and speak
[48:49] comfortably unto her and I'll give her
[48:51] her Vineyards from th and the valley of
[48:53] aor for a door of hope so in this place
[48:57] where where where this sin was dwelt
[48:59] with this this this failure was was
[49:02] remedied it became a doorway into
[49:06] expectation that's the Bible word hope
[49:07] is an expectation and she shall sing
[49:10] there in the days of her youth in the
[49:12] days when she came out of the land of
[49:13] Egypt and it shall be at that day sayeth
[49:15] the Lord that thou shalt call me ishy
[49:18] and shall not call me no more B so isi
[49:20] is married I believe it is for I will
[49:22] take away the names of balam out of her
[49:24] mouth and they shall be no more
[49:27] um sorry and they shall no more be
[49:29] remembered by their name there's a Door
[49:33] of Hope and
[49:34] failure God wants to give you a Door of
[49:36] Hope because he doesn't want you he
[49:38] doesn't want you on the ground he wants
[49:41] you to
[49:42] rise so you may lose a battle you ain't
[49:46] going to lose the war right that's why I
[49:48] just want to get that out there right
[49:49] now we ain't going to lose the war you
[49:51] lost the battle you know I know I've
[49:53] said it before but Winston Churchill
[49:54] where where Nazis had basically Rampage
[49:57] through Europe they were they were the
[49:59] only reason that England was still
[50:00] standing was because of the channel but
[50:02] he said look we're going to look and
[50:04] church WIll knew they didn't have the
[50:06] equipment or even the manpower to to
[50:08] withstand a Nazi attack but did but did
[50:10] he show that he said no we'll fight them
[50:13] on the beaches we'll fight them in the
[50:14] HED RS I mean we'll fight them on the
[50:16] landing Landing zones we shall Never
[50:19] Surrender I because he had a grit we
[50:21] ain't quitting just because we our our
[50:24] backs are against the wall and things
[50:25] look dark we ain't quitting in these
[50:27] kind of circumstances and friends I you
[50:29] know if a man who's not even saved who's
[50:32] fighting a natural War can stand there
[50:34] and rally his Nation am mean though he
[50:36] knows the facts are he's in trouble amen
[50:39] but the truth he believes they can win
[50:41] ultimately I mean even though he says
[50:43] though though help help can come from
[50:45] across the oceans though it does not we
[50:46] will still stand so now now if he can
[50:49] stand there like that what about the
[50:51] Bride of Jesus Christ amen that we're
[50:53] not fighting a natural War we're
[50:55] fighting a spiritual war and Churchill
[50:57] did not know if they' ultimately win the
[50:59] war but we've read the back of the book
[51:01] am mean we've seen that we win in the
[51:03] end that the war has been won amen so so
[51:06] if he can stand there with that grit how
[51:07] much more you and
[51:08] I so the true church of living God
[51:11] doesn't
[51:12] quit it never it never it never calls
[51:17] peace terms with the devil we ain't
[51:19] peacekeepers here we're conquerors I
[51:22] mean we don't put up with him he's not
[51:24] welcome his little foot his little toe
[51:26] in our land is not welcome he's not
[51:28] welcome anywhere he has no part in you
[51:31] and you have no part in him amen so his
[51:33] works if you have that Revelation you
[51:35] realize any even even the thought of his
[51:37] work should abore you completely should
[51:40] frighten you should say no I want
[51:41] nothing he's got no pardon me so I've
[51:43] got no pardon
[51:45] him Amen brother R says let me show you
[51:48] another reason why Satan hates this book
[51:50] of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[51:52] church he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[51:54] same yesterday today and forever and he
[51:57] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[51:59] more than do 90% of the theologians he
[52:01] knows that since God is immutable in his
[52:04] nature then he is just as immutable in
[52:06] his ways thus that means he doesn't
[52:08] change okay thus Satan knows ass surely
[52:10] that the original church at Pentecost
[52:13] with the power of God Mark 16 and action
[52:15] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[52:17] his own all us is false it has to be now
[52:20] remember this Christ in the true church
[52:22] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[52:25] amen so Christ in the true church is a
[52:27] continuation of the book of Acts you got
[52:28] to realize now that if the Bible will
[52:30] still be written today if you're part of
[52:33] that true church that your acts would be
[52:34] written in the book of Acts it would be
[52:37] it would be the biggest volume that's in
[52:38] the Bible would you know this whole this
[52:40] whole room could not contain the book of
[52:42] Acts because for 2,000 years God has
[52:45] been writing a book of Acts amen and it
[52:47] wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was
[52:49] the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[52:51] apostles amen so the true church is the
[52:54] the book of Acts being written
[52:56] continuing on Amen so you to realize
[52:58] when Jesus said if the you know he said
[53:01] that I am the vine you are the branches
[53:03] right so now if the first church put
[53:05] forth a branch where the power of God
[53:07] was on display the word had preeminence
[53:10] people sold out completely they were
[53:12] born again amen their old nature was
[53:14] dead God lived in power amen his word
[53:17] was manifested the signs were following
[53:20] amen they love the Lord more than
[53:21] anything even more than their own lives
[53:23] then would not the second Branch produce
[53:25] the same fruit
[53:27] would not the third branch produce the
[53:29] same fruit would not every branch that
[53:31] vine puts out would it not produce that
[53:33] same kind of Life of love and joy and
[53:37] peace amen goodness Faith being
[53:39] longsuffering would it not produce the
[53:42] one fruit of the spirit which is all
[53:43] those
[53:45] things amen but the Book of Revelation
[53:48] shows that the Antichrist Spirit would
[53:50] come into the church and defile it
[53:52] making it lukew formal and Powerless it
[53:54] exposes Satan revealing his works the
[53:56] attempted destruction of God's people
[53:58] and the discrediting of God's word right
[54:00] down to the time he's cast to the Lake
[54:02] of Fire he fights that he cannot stand
[54:04] it he knows that if the people get the
[54:06] true revelation of the true church and
[54:08] what she is and what she stands for that
[54:11] she can do the greater work she'll be an
[54:13] invincible Army if they get a true
[54:15] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[54:17] framework of the Christian church and by
[54:19] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[54:21] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[54:23] powerless before her he will be defly
[54:25] thoughted today as when Christ with stod
[54:27] his every effort to gain power over him
[54:29] in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation
[54:31] but we love it with true Revelation in
[54:33] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[54:35] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[54:38] over them amen just like Joshua was told
[54:41] without fail you're going to take every
[54:42] gate of every city you're going to take
[54:44] the Gate of AI you're going to take the
[54:46] Gate of Jericho you're going to take the
[54:48] Gate of uh gibian or wherever they are
[54:50] fighting you're going to take every
[54:52] single gate doesn't matter how big those
[54:54] gates are you're going to prevail
[54:56] against them amen because the True
[54:58] Church of the Living God is built upon
[55:00] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[55:02] when when Jesus asked his disciples in
[55:04] Matthew 16 who do men say that I am they
[55:08] thought that he was some Prophet that
[55:09] would that had resurrected cuz they saw
[55:12] the part of God that was manifested in
[55:14] those prophets the fullness of God was
[55:16] in Jesus Christ right so they could see
[55:18] the characteristics of Jeremiah John the
[55:20] Baptist or one of the prophets but Jesus
[55:22] asked the question but who do you say
[55:24] that I am that's such an important
[55:26] question friends that that question
[55:27] comes to every one of us but who do you
[55:29] say the word is amen is it a nice book
[55:32] of Ethics even the message I yeah I
[55:34] include that in there is it a nice nice
[55:37] way to live nice way to raise your
[55:39] family whole bunch of incredible
[55:41] testimonies of God living a prophetic
[55:44] Ministry or is it to you Jesus Christ
[55:47] revealed amen because he asked who do
[55:49] you say that I who do you say that I am
[55:51] and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the
[55:52] son of the Living God and Jesus said now
[55:55] notice the the the the whole framework
[55:57] of this um conversation is built around
[56:00] Revelation Jesus asked what's been
[56:02] revealed to the people well you're a
[56:03] prophet now what's been revealed to you
[56:05] who do you say that I am and Peter says
[56:07] you are the Christ son of the Living God
[56:09] and then of course Jesus says blessed
[56:11] are you Simon by Jonah for flesh and
[56:13] blood has not revealed this unto you but
[56:15] my Father which is in heaven so it's
[56:17] Revelation now Upon This Rock I'll build
[56:19] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[56:21] not Prevail against it so if your life
[56:23] is built upon a church culture you ain't
[56:25] going to prevail against the gates of
[56:27] hell if it's if it's built upon
[56:30] tradition if it's built upon
[56:31] intellectual understanding you will not
[56:33] Prevail against the gates of hell but if
[56:35] your life is built upon the revelation
[56:37] of the word where Jesus Christ he his
[56:40] word becomes quickened into your heart
[56:42] and it changes your life there's no gate
[56:44] that can withstand you I it doesn't
[56:46] matter how big it is doesn't matter how
[56:47] big the reasoning is or the
[56:49] circumstances may be that's all Gates
[56:51] amen because remember reasoning well I'm
[56:53] sick I can't reasoning comes in well you
[56:55] can't get well or the medicine is not
[56:56] working that's a gate but the word says
[56:59] by his stripes we're healed right so now
[57:01] his word should Prevail against the
[57:03] symptoms against the reasoning amen you
[57:05] say well my family's falling apart
[57:07] reasoning says they can't get back but
[57:08] the word says amen that I will put my
[57:11] word and thy thy seed seed henceforth
[57:14] Forever This is my Covenant with them
[57:15] that's in
[57:16] Isaiah amen isn't that right that's what
[57:19] the promise is so don't let any gate try
[57:22] and stop you no we're going to storm
[57:24] them all God made you as a battering ram
[57:28] Hallelujah God made you as a battering
[57:30] ram doesn't matter what the devil puts
[57:32] in front of you it's going down your
[57:35] past that's going down complexes it's
[57:38] going down hurt it's going down
[57:40] situations going down what your five
[57:42] censes declare to you it's going down
[57:45] I'm going through because I know there's
[57:46] a promise over there and it's mine amen
[57:49] Jesus died that I'd receive it so where
[57:51] is it I want it now you want to see a
[57:54] kid who's very persistent tell them
[57:56] you're going to give them something that
[57:57] they
[57:58] like that's the faith of his little
[58:00] child and they'll keep going and they'll
[58:03] keep badgering and they'll keep asking
[58:06] and they'll keep seeking until they get
[58:08] it and we get annoyed at that but God's
[58:11] trying to show you through that child
[58:13] this is how you need to be don't quit do
[58:15] you think they
[58:16] quit everyone who's got everyone who's
[58:19] got children understand this right they
[58:20] don't quit man they're they're like wow
[58:22] you know if only I had that tenacity you
[58:24] do in the spiritual sense you should
[58:27] right God said it's mine all things are
[58:29] mine I possess all things the power of
[58:32] God Is Mine the reality of his word is
[58:34] mine the holy ghost moving in my life is
[58:37] mine am mean every promise is mine
[58:39] because he purchased it for me that day
[58:41] on Calvary it's all mine I want it I
[58:44] want to see it live amen L you say you
[58:46] don't have the faith well Lord increase
[58:48] my faith amen don't don't increase my
[58:50] feelings increase my faith Lord because
[58:52] the promise is mine Hallelujah
[58:56] amen our God is an inexhaustible
[58:58] Fountain of faith and
[59:00] Revelation but you see if we turn off to
[59:03] a stagnated stream we ain't going to
[59:06] overcome a stream of reasoning
[59:08] circumstance trouble what people say no
[59:11] go back to what the word says
[59:14] amen amen now if you're part of the true

[59:53] the woman to do that never compow our
[59:55] men not to drink not to swear you just
[59:57] preach the gospel lay down the pattern
[59:58] of the Bible many men that comes to the
[1:00:00] Pentecostal faith and the Holiness
[1:00:02] faiths come in and profess to be when
[1:00:04] they're not in their heart many women
[1:00:05] does the same thing you don't tell them
[1:00:08] they have to do it you just give them
[1:00:09] the pattern tell them what the Bible
[1:00:11] says and if they're born of the Heavenly
[1:00:12] Spirit then their spirit is no more
[1:00:14] Americanized it's no more germanized
[1:00:16] it's heavenli ised am mean we're the
[1:00:19] kingdom of God because we're in another
[1:00:21] kingdom a kingdom of God where decency
[1:00:23] Holiness and power exists
[1:00:26] hallelujah amen so my spirit's been
[1:00:29] Heavenly ised amen cuz I belong to a
[1:00:32] different land praise God I'm I'm happy
[1:00:35] about that amen I'm happy about that
[1:00:38] amen because that means my spirit will
[1:00:39] cope with the word that means I love the
[1:00:41] Lord more than anything that means I'll
[1:00:43] put others before myself amen that means
[1:00:46] there's no selfish bone in my body amen
[1:00:48] why because my spirit has been Heavenly
[1:00:51] eyes
[1:00:53] amen praise the Lord why cuz I I belong
[1:00:56] to a kingdom where decency Holiness and
[1:00:58] power exist amen not a
[1:01:02] modesty filth and
[1:01:04] lukewarmness you belong all to the
[1:01:06] kingdom of God children amen this I'm
[1:01:10] pre yeah it's nice I get to preach to
[1:01:11] the choir all the time but you got to
[1:01:13] realize no I'm of a different spirit so
[1:01:15] when someone from your country comes
[1:01:16] along and tries to get you under their
[1:01:18] influence you got to realize no I can't
[1:01:20] ident sure I well it's nice being half
[1:01:23] South African I can identify with all
[1:01:25] the good food
[1:01:26] F it's a land of
[1:01:29] flavor I like food but when it comes to
[1:01:32] that Spirit of segregation that Spirit
[1:01:35] of aparte which I hate to say is still
[1:01:37] there I can't I can't identify with that
[1:01:41] because the spirit of God is all about a
[1:01:42] Oneness of the body one thing I hate in
[1:01:45] this life is racism I detest that spirit
[1:01:48] I hate that thing I want it to die and
[1:01:50] when it Surs a lake of fire I'm going to
[1:01:52] do a big dance cuz I hate that thing cuz
[1:01:54] it brings separation it brings Vision it
[1:01:56] brings distrust it brings everything
[1:01:58] that's not of God Amen but a Heavenly
[1:02:01] Spirit doesn't look at skin color
[1:02:04] because it's like when I go to Papa
[1:02:05] Guinea I'll just say it in English I say
[1:02:07] listen don't look at this we're all
[1:02:10] children of God there's no difference
[1:02:11] between us and it's the same here
[1:02:15] Glory Hallelujah I'm so thankful for
[1:02:18] that amen but see see now if our
[1:02:21] spirit's Heavenly then then we can't
[1:02:23] identify with our national Spirit we we
[1:02:26] can't identify with a tall poppy
[1:02:27] syndrome of a of a stabbing people in
[1:02:30] the back not saying things straight to
[1:02:31] their face and oh she'll be right kind
[1:02:33] of an attitude we can't identify with
[1:02:35] that sure it takes a while you know when
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost comes in he's got to take
[1:02:39] dominion over those things but we're got
[1:02:41] to realize that being a being a former
[1:02:44] um I'll say transformed New Zealander I
[1:02:47] was going to say rehabilitator but we
[1:02:48] Ain re rehabilitated we're transformed
[1:02:50] by the Holy Ghost right but you see I
[1:02:53] can't identify with that anymore cuz
[1:02:54] that's not my spirit
[1:02:57] I have of the spirit of decency in an
[1:02:59] order where things are above board
[1:03:01] things aren't manipulated and great
[1:03:03] everything's black or
[1:03:04] white
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:07] hallelujah amen we we live in a realm
[1:03:11] where power
[1:03:12] exists his power not National Power you
[1:03:16] know the greatest thing that brother
[1:03:17] Braham said that the greatest thing that
[1:03:19] a that a country can have that keeps off
[1:03:21] war and strife as Holy Ghost filed
[1:03:23] churches and camp meetings he says with
[1:03:25] more than hundreds of atomic bombs and
[1:03:28] silos am mean you got to realize the
[1:03:30] reason we have peace in this country is
[1:03:31] cuz God
[1:03:33] moves you are actually the biggest
[1:03:35] blessing to this nation and the nation
[1:03:36] doesn't even know it amen why cuz God is
[1:03:39] still here cuz you're here amen so we
[1:03:43] should never ever try and quench the
[1:03:45] spirit of God you know this kiwi Spirit
[1:03:47] quenches the spirit of God it doesn't
[1:03:49] want to talk about God it wants you to
[1:03:51] be happy about everything but God but
[1:03:54] the word says quench not the spirit
[1:03:56] so I think let's do the opposite let's
[1:03:58] just open the floodgates amen let's let
[1:04:01] them move in great power amen let's not
[1:04:03] try and St me it down and just cold
[1:04:05] formal you know I went to I went to you
[1:04:07] boarding school and it was an Anglican
[1:04:09] boarding school and do you know what the
[1:04:10] saddest thing was walking into a church
[1:04:13] where it's cold and formal you just
[1:04:16] repeat what the P this is Anglican
[1:04:17] Church I don't know why I'm going here
[1:04:18] but this is this is something a kiwi
[1:04:21] loves a formality even though we we
[1:04:23] appear to be informal okay you know but
[1:04:25] they you know they want to form even
[1:04:27] casual being casuals a form we ain't
[1:04:29] casual about the gospel we ain't casual
[1:04:32] about our Lord he wasn't casual about us
[1:04:34] he wasn't like yeah maybe I'll go die
[1:04:36] we'll see what happens whatever no he
[1:04:38] was determined amen he did not let
[1:04:40] anything stop him he didn't let the
[1:04:42] Pharisees stop him didn't let unbelief
[1:04:44] stop him didn't let the scribes stop him
[1:04:46] didn't even let his own disciples stop
[1:04:48] him when Satan got into Peter said you
[1:04:50] know no no Lord you can't go to Calvary
[1:04:52] you can't do this he said just get
[1:04:53] behind me Satan he identified anointing
[1:04:56] the inspiration on Peter you see he let
[1:04:58] nothing stop him cuz he had a greater
[1:05:00] thing he was looking at the joy that was
[1:05:02] set before him which was you redeemed
[1:05:04] that's why he went to Calvary amen for
[1:05:06] this cause I've come into the world
[1:05:08] praise the Lord now if he could look
[1:05:10] beyond the now and see the future cannot
[1:05:12] the true church of living
[1:05:14] God cannot cannot they look by faith and
[1:05:17] see the realities of his word greater
[1:05:20] than
[1:05:21] circumstance amen we can we're Heavenly
[1:05:25] eyes we can look
[1:05:27] Beyond amen let's try and get somewhere
[1:05:29] here
[1:05:31] now this we have one head this Kingdom
[1:05:35] has one king it ain't me it ain't a
[1:05:38] hierarchy of preachers it ain't the
[1:05:41] prophet it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:43] himself amen the one who governs this
[1:05:45] church is the Holy Ghost I actually said
[1:05:47] in SAR I said actually I'm the associate
[1:05:50] pastor here he's the main pastor and
[1:05:53] that's not passing the buck that's
[1:05:54] actually saying now what does the a
[1:05:55] pastor
[1:05:56] say what does he say about a situation
[1:06:00] and he's always his word right so the
[1:06:02] Holy Ghost he says the Dynamics of the
[1:06:04] Holy Ghost runs the church the prophet
[1:06:06] taught us am mean so in reality I say I
[1:06:09] am the associate because it's not my
[1:06:10] opinion that governs the church it's his
[1:06:12] word his word governing the church amen
[1:06:15] so now he is he has instructed
[1:06:18] us that we are to preach repentance and
[1:06:22] remission of sin should be preached in
[1:06:24] his name among all nations beginning at
[1:06:26] Jerusalem this is the orders of this
[1:06:27] church this is your orders that you're
[1:06:29] here to live ye and ye are witnesses of
[1:06:31] these things and behold I S the promise
[1:06:34] of my father upon you but car you in the
[1:06:36] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:06:38] with power from on high amen so this
[1:06:41] this gospel comes with power it comes
[1:06:43] with force it doesn't come with
[1:06:45] intellectual reasoning it comes with the
[1:06:46] power the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:49] so we have been instructed that we
[1:06:51] should preach repentance and remission
[1:06:52] of sins should begin pre being preached
[1:06:55] in his name from Jerusalem but it has to
[1:06:56] go to All Nations even to New Zealand to
[1:06:59] the end of the world this is the end of
[1:07:01] the Earth right here but we're but this
[1:07:03] is what we're instructed to do now this
[1:07:06] this began now you say this is the
[1:07:08] orders of the church to preach
[1:07:09] repentance and remission of sins in his
[1:07:11] name now this began in Jerusalem where
[1:07:14] Peter would preach on the day of
[1:07:16] Pentecost and he would you know you know
[1:07:18] he had preached and tell the people they
[1:07:20] have crucified the very Messiah and then
[1:07:22] and then they ask well then what shall
[1:07:24] we do men and Brethren what what shall
[1:07:25] we do and Peter said him repent be
[1:07:27] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:07:29] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:07:32] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:07:33] Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:07:35] to your children and to all that are far
[1:07:37] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:07:39] shall call amen so this is this is how
[1:07:42] um repentance and remission of sins
[1:07:44] should be preached in his name repent be
[1:07:47] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:07:49] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:07:50] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:52] we know as pet Jesus would say in
[1:07:54] Matthew 28 19 that that teach All
[1:07:56] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:07:58] the father Son and Holy Ghost one name
[1:08:01] and we from reading the scripture many
[1:08:04] people think that Peter either
[1:08:06] contradicts Jesus or Jesus's words of
[1:08:08] Matthew 28 are greater than Peter's
[1:08:11] words in Acts chapter 2 they aren't
[1:08:13] greater they ain't contradictory the one
[1:08:16] who Jesus that instructed his disciples
[1:08:18] to be B baptized people the name of
[1:08:20] Father Son and Holy Ghost was the same
[1:08:22] Jesus speaking through Peter in Acts
[1:08:23] chapter 2 there's no contradiction
[1:08:26] it's all see the Bible's all red letter
[1:08:29] it's all the words of God right so then
[1:08:31] then then then how does this reconcile
[1:08:33] well it's very very simple if you look
[1:08:35] at Matthew 28:19 it says name of father
[1:08:38] son Holy Ghost we understand that what
[1:08:40] is the name of them what is his name
[1:08:43] father's not a name I'm a father that's
[1:08:45] not my name I'm a son it's not my name
[1:08:48] I'm a person that's what I am like the
[1:08:50] Holy Ghost is what he is but none of
[1:08:52] those are titles they're just names so
[1:08:53] what is the name of the father son holy
[1:08:55] Holy Ghost well Jesus said I come in my
[1:08:57] father's name you receive me not what's
[1:08:59] the name of the father Jesus Jehovah's
[1:09:01] salvation he is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:03] that is the one name of the father son
[1:09:05] Holy Ghost you say these things aren't
[1:09:07] very important well according to the
[1:09:09] king of this of this body of this people
[1:09:13] of the true church it's
[1:09:15] important
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:20] now Church the word church actually
[1:09:22] means the called out ones where where in
[1:09:26] the um Israel was not called a church
[1:09:28] until it came out of Egypt So speaking
[1:09:31] of the called out ones so so we have
[1:09:33] been called out by this word amen to
[1:09:35] walk with him now we have access to our
[1:09:39] King see the true church of living God
[1:09:41] has access to to their King because he
[1:09:45] is the only mediator between God and man
[1:09:47] as the man Christ Jesus right so we have
[1:09:49] an interview with him uh whenever we
[1:09:52] want to call upon him we have no other
[1:09:53] intercessors no other mediator between
[1:09:55] the king and us but that one man Christ
[1:09:58] Jesus so we're living in a kingdom and
[1:10:00] we call it in the chronological um
[1:10:02] chronologically of the Bible the
[1:10:03] Messianic Messianic Kingdom in other
[1:10:05] words where the Messiah rules in every
[1:10:07] life in his domain ruling the Liv of his
[1:10:10] people are called out people from every
[1:10:12] Walk of Life Gathering them together in
[1:10:14] a group and calls it his church or his
[1:10:16] called out ones isn't that a beautiful
[1:10:18] thing now Israel was the people of God
[1:10:20] until we find in Acts 7:38 if you're
[1:10:22] putting it down that they were called
[1:10:24] The Church of God because they were
[1:10:26] called of God out of Egypt out of the
[1:10:28] world out away from other churches out
[1:10:31] away from other religions to walk with
[1:10:33] God
[1:10:35] Alone now we have an important role in
[1:10:37] this in this Kingdom because the Lord
[1:10:40] said we he's made us Kings and Priests
[1:10:42] to God so a king and a priest a king has
[1:10:46] Dominion right that's why we read Mark
[1:10:48] 16 it's amazing it's amazing with Mark
[1:10:51] 16 where many many new translations of
[1:10:54] the Bible they actually say that these
[1:10:57] scriptures are not actually in the
[1:10:59] original manuscripts that it's not the
[1:11:01] inspired word of God and you know I find
[1:11:04] it interesting because I've laid hands
[1:11:06] on the sick and they've recovered I've
[1:11:09] had warts you know when I was a young
[1:11:11] Christian I had a walk growing on my
[1:11:12] hand one and I just lay my hand upon it
[1:11:14] no was in to pray said Lord I ask you to
[1:11:17] take the life out of this thing and take
[1:11:18] it from me in the name of the Lord and
[1:11:20] it it went smaller and it shriveled up
[1:11:22] and left never came back and so you know
[1:11:26] and how many have been L hands have been
[1:11:28] laid upon them and been been healed or
[1:11:30] touched right so if God see see all the
[1:11:34] word's inspired but if people argue it's
[1:11:36] not inspired well you'd say well if God
[1:11:38] can do that with the uninspired what can
[1:11:40] he do with the inspired but we know it's
[1:11:43] all
[1:11:44] inspired but this is the principal works
[1:11:46] of the church to cast out the enemy amen
[1:11:50] wherever you find that evil one cast
[1:11:52] them out amen cast them out by the love
[1:11:54] of God cast him out by prayer cast him
[1:11:56] out by fasting but don't put up with him
[1:11:59] in your life amen we are called to lay
[1:12:02] hands on the
[1:12:03] sick speak with new tongues I don't know
[1:12:07] why people are afraid of the gifts we
[1:12:09] ain't afraid of the gifts that's part of
[1:12:11] God right but we should let God manifest
[1:12:15] Mark 16 in our lives this is the true
[1:12:17] church in
[1:12:18] action amen and God has restored all
[1:12:22] that back into the church in this day
[1:12:25] now I just want to make a bit of a segue
[1:12:29] here because as we read in the
[1:12:31] beginning
[1:12:33] that Joshua said that the Ark of the
[1:12:36] Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth
[1:12:37] passeth over before you into Jordan so
[1:12:40] to make an entrance to cross into a new
[1:12:42] land and this is what the true church
[1:12:44] does its Works give an entrance that
[1:12:48] people can receive the true baptism of
[1:12:50] the Holy Ghost and become part of the
[1:12:52] body that's the true church in action
[1:12:55] are you following me right this is the
[1:12:57] true church in action and we all have a
[1:12:59] role to play in
[1:13:01] that amen we're not bystanders we are
[1:13:04] participators we're all part of the same
[1:13:08] body
[1:13:10] okay now David would pray in the um
[1:13:13] Psalms the psalm of David Lord I cry
[1:13:16] unto thee make haste unto me give ear
[1:13:18] unto my voice when I cry unto thee let
[1:13:21] my prayer be set forth before thee as
[1:13:24] incense and the lifting up of my hands
[1:13:26] as the evening sacrifice this was this
[1:13:30] was David's prayer that his actions
[1:13:32] would be would be the same as as his
[1:13:35] prayers would be the same as the incense
[1:13:36] the altar of incense which is a sweet
[1:13:38] Savor to the Lord right so so God God
[1:13:42] when he hears our prayers it would be a
[1:13:43] sweet thing before him amen because we
[1:13:46] understand but by the shed blood of the
[1:13:48] Lamb that when we go to talking with God
[1:13:51] Amen if you're under the blood all of
[1:13:52] Heaven has to be quiet because God wants
[1:13:55] to hear your
[1:13:56] prayer but he says and the lifting up my
[1:13:58] hands as the evening sacrifice what is
[1:14:00] the evening sacrifice it's the time when
[1:14:02] the atonement is made time when
[1:14:05] reconciliation happens amen the evening
[1:14:07] sacrifice is is that sacrifice that
[1:14:10] Elijah gave on Mount Carmel to turn the
[1:14:12] hearts of the people back to worshiping
[1:14:14] God again amen so David's prayer is Lord
[1:14:17] may my life may My Worship to you bring
[1:14:21] reconciliation amen turn people's hearts
[1:14:23] back when I lift up my hand and sweet
[1:14:25] surrender with Thanksgiving Lord may you
[1:14:28] come down into my worship and touch
[1:14:30] someone's life amen that that that their
[1:14:32] heart is maybe their hearts been turned
[1:14:34] to the world been turned to Idols being
[1:14:36] turned to self being turned to Pride but
[1:14:38] may My Worship turn them amen you you
[1:14:42] got to realize we don't just sing for
[1:14:43] the sake of it we're not just Christians
[1:14:45] for the sake of it amen but God wants to
[1:14:47] use you as a Channel of his inspiration
[1:14:50] as his anointing am me because God wants
[1:14:52] to touch people Amen in this world
[1:14:54] through you
[1:14:55] yes so we're not just here to polish up
[1:14:58] things and make it sound good no we're
[1:14:59] here to worship amen that Lord when I
[1:15:01] pray may be a sweet selling sweet
[1:15:04] smelling incense before you Lord may be
[1:15:06] pleasing oh God but you as we were
[1:15:09] talking about it this week how brother
[1:15:11] Ram says that your thoughts are louder
[1:15:13] in heaven than your words amen so and
[1:15:16] and to me that that's such a blessed
[1:15:18] thing Lord may my may my thoughts of how
[1:15:21] great you are you're just walking
[1:15:22] through life Lord you're so awesome who
[1:15:25] knows what I'm talking about Lord you're
[1:15:26] so great Lord You Found Me Lord I'm so
[1:15:29] thankful Lord I was walking down this
[1:15:31] broad path of destruction and Lord you
[1:15:33] brought me on this narrow way and Lord
[1:15:35] you shed your blood for me and Lord
[1:15:36] You've redeemed me and Lord I knew what
[1:15:38] I was but thank God I'm not that person
[1:15:40] no more because of what you've done in
[1:15:42] my life Lord I'm so thankful Calvary
[1:15:44] became a reality to me Lord I'm so glad
[1:15:47] lord it's more than a story more than a
[1:15:49] nice idea more than a song but a reality
[1:15:51] that's gripped my life Lord I would love
[1:15:53] those thoughts just to reverberate
[1:15:55] Around Heaven hallelu that actually
[1:15:57] shakes Heaven amen cuz the sound like
[1:16:00] the Bas you you can feel the Bas so you
[1:16:02] sometimes it's so strong I pray our
[1:16:04] thoughts are like that through Heaven
[1:16:06] amen
[1:16:07] amen and and the Lord says I like that
[1:16:09] kind of
[1:16:11] thoughts
[1:16:12] glory
[1:16:15] amen now the
[1:16:19] priests had to stand in Jordan with the
[1:16:21] Ark in order to create a uh in order for
[1:16:25] Israel to cross over now this is very
[1:16:29] important they came to Jordan during the
[1:16:32] spring when it was
[1:16:34] flooding God orchestrated it that way
[1:16:37] because God wanted them to know the
[1:16:39] reason you're Crossing into your
[1:16:40] inheritance is not because of you but
[1:16:43] because you're following my word you're
[1:16:45] following the ark the Ark of all the
[1:16:47] Earth the Lord of all the Earth you're
[1:16:49] following me that's why I'm going to
[1:16:51] create a way for you to walk over a walk
[1:16:54] o walk through a river that actually
[1:16:55] becomes dry ground amen so those priests
[1:16:58] now they had to step into that water as
[1:17:00] soon as they did that water parted and
[1:17:03] however many million people whatever in
[1:17:05] all their o and you can see in the back
[1:17:06] of this picture they all can cross over
[1:17:08] cuz why the Ark of the Lord of all the
[1:17:11] Earth was being carried by the
[1:17:15] priesthood and they were commanded now
[1:17:17] if I can go back to this for the priests
[1:17:19] which bear the ark stood in the midst of
[1:17:20] Jordan until everything was finished
[1:17:23] that the Lord commanded Joshua
[1:17:26] we ain't done God ain't
[1:17:29] done we got to stand in that Jordan
[1:17:33] represents death you got to stand in
[1:17:36] that death that that someone whosoever
[1:17:40] will can see you standing there carrying
[1:17:43] the word and they find an entrance into
[1:17:46] the Holy
[1:17:47] Ghost we have an important job you say I
[1:17:50] don't preach this is with all of us I
[1:17:53] don't sing this is with I don't play I
[1:17:55] don't I'm not some outward person in the
[1:17:58] church this is still
[1:18:01] you don't ever let the devil diminish
[1:18:05] what your position is your impact in
[1:18:08] life he makes us try and think we're
[1:18:10] useless helpless that we're ineffective
[1:18:12] he's lying to you he's lying to you why
[1:18:15] listen to his lies and say well I'm
[1:18:17] helpless if God be for you who can be
[1:18:20] against you amen no one can be against
[1:18:23] you nothing can Prevail if God before
[1:18:25] you amen but if you're not standing your
[1:18:27] position how can God be for
[1:18:30] you
[1:18:32] Hallelujah so they stood there until all
[1:18:36] was all was done I say friends there's
[1:18:40] still names in the book that have not
[1:18:43] crossed Jordan they have not died to S
[1:18:45] and be filled with the Holy Ghost they
[1:18:47] have not done that yet they've been on
[1:18:48] the journey they've come out of Egypt
[1:18:51] thank the Lord they've gone through the
[1:18:52] Wilderness God's cleansed their lives
[1:18:54] thank God God's got to do those things
[1:18:56] but they have not crossed Jordan yet
[1:18:58] they're not home
[1:19:00] safe that's why never be satisfied be
[1:19:03] thankful someone's on their way but
[1:19:05] don't be satisfied they're on their way
[1:19:07] only be satisfied when their home's safe
[1:19:10] because when the home safe is sealed to
[1:19:12] the day of their
[1:19:13] Redemption so we must never just be
[1:19:15] satisfied as someone just gets a touch
[1:19:17] from the Lord that's great but Lord may
[1:19:20] they get home
[1:19:22] safe amen so Lord May May Our
[1:19:26] Lives May our lifting of our hands be as
[1:19:28] that evening sacrifice till everyone is
[1:19:31] home safe under the
[1:19:34] blood
[1:19:36] Hallelujah but you see what happens is
[1:19:39] we've got to lay this to Heart we're
[1:19:41] actually going to take this on board lay
[1:19:43] it to
[1:19:45] heart and Jeremiah says many pastors
[1:19:48] have destroyed my Vineyard they have
[1:19:50] trotten my portion underf fooot they
[1:19:52] have made my Pleasant portion a
[1:19:55] Wilderness they have made it desolate
[1:19:57] and being desolate it mourneth unto me
[1:19:59] the whole land is made desolate because
[1:20:01] no man layth it too
[1:20:07] heart we can't be like that friends we
[1:20:10] can't just go through the mo and now I'm
[1:20:12] not saying you are but never let the
[1:20:14] devil push you back and say well you
[1:20:15] just got to go through the motions of
[1:20:17] life no you've got a job you've got a
[1:20:21] calling and God's equipped you to live
[1:20:23] your calling out
[1:20:25] Amen to never become detached you got to
[1:20:27] realize we should have a
[1:20:29] burden for Humanity we should have a
[1:20:33] burden for our families now I'm not
[1:20:35] saying you don't but if you feel
[1:20:37] burdened that way God gave you that
[1:20:39] burden you should you should be bothered
[1:20:41] when people appear to be going sideways
[1:20:44] it should bother you not in a well they
[1:20:47] they know better and they deserve it
[1:20:48] what no no no it should bother you Lord
[1:20:50] get them back on the path something
[1:20:51] should cry out Lord bring them home
[1:20:55] bring them back lord they've being
[1:20:56] enticed and gone this way bring them
[1:20:58] back into that straight and narrow road
[1:20:59] Lord it should bother us if we love each
[1:21:02] other it
[1:21:04] should and you know when it says pastors
[1:21:07] here I know that's me but it's not you
[1:21:09] know mothers are pastors they've got a
[1:21:11] church Christine's got a Congregation of
[1:21:16] four She lays it to
[1:21:18] heart She lays it to her it's a good
[1:21:21] thing she cares I know you all do m and
[1:21:24] dads but you got to realize it's not
[1:21:26] it's not my job
[1:21:27] only to save your
[1:21:30] children I have my role but church
[1:21:33] starts at home right Fellowship starts
[1:21:36] at home am mean that when they when they
[1:21:38] see you they should see something they
[1:21:43] want they shouldn't see religion they
[1:21:46] should and irrespective of what
[1:21:48] condition our lives are you know what
[1:21:49] we're going through what do they see and
[1:21:52] I put that on me I remember when analis
[1:21:53] was born I I begin to think what will
[1:21:55] she
[1:21:57] see when when she grows up and sees me
[1:21:59] and then she gets to an age where she
[1:22:01] begins to compare and contrast with
[1:22:02] people and all these things what is she
[1:22:04] going to see a religious man God
[1:22:07] forbid someone who's just all rules and
[1:22:11] regulations God forbid will she see
[1:22:14] actually you know that that that when
[1:22:16] God begins to reveal himself to her you
[1:22:18] know will she be all confused cuz she
[1:22:20] thought God is like me cuz that's what
[1:22:22] happens us as fathers in print on our
[1:22:25] children a subconscious image of who God
[1:22:28] is so will she have this kind of
[1:22:30] confusion but God you say you're like
[1:22:32] this but I think you're like this cuz my
[1:22:33] father's like this you know or will she
[1:22:35] actually say oh yes that's the
[1:22:38] Lord because she doesn't have that
[1:22:41] confusion what about mom does she get
[1:22:45] this image how because really how mom is
[1:22:47] is how church should be the environment
[1:22:49] she creates remember we should this
[1:22:52] place should be a place of love and Care
[1:22:55] someone comes in something mortally
[1:22:58] wounded you know you like a hospital
[1:23:00] right what happens first so ambulance
[1:23:03] comes in someone with enough care gave
[1:23:06] their lives to serve their Community by
[1:23:08] being an ambulance driver they actually
[1:23:10] care they want to make a difference so a
[1:23:12] call comes out they go as fast as they
[1:23:14] can they get that person they're not
[1:23:15] indifferent they're like man you you've
[1:23:18] given me all this training all the
[1:23:20] training I I want to put into this
[1:23:21] person to get them to a place where they
[1:23:23] can get the proper help and shouldn't it
[1:23:25] be the same thing the Lord has given us
[1:23:27] training amen shouldn't I trust I'm not
[1:23:29] missing out parts of this that it
[1:23:31] doesn't impact you but you see you know
[1:23:33] the Lord has given us training that we
[1:23:34] should care when someone has been
[1:23:36] spiritually wounded even physically
[1:23:38] wounded amen that we now have a place a
[1:23:42] hospital a place of rest and healing
[1:23:45] that people can come and be refreshed
[1:23:47] and be renewed and be patched up and be
[1:23:49] sewn up and be
[1:23:51] fixed but it's the attitude of the staff
[1:23:55] that matter who's ever had a real caring
[1:23:59] nurse who's had a not caring
[1:24:04] nurse they do the same thing they do the
[1:24:07] same job but they're Polar Opposites we
[1:24:11] don't want to be the uncaring nurse we
[1:24:13] want to be the caring one right and so
[1:24:18] but then but then home should be like
[1:24:20] that too the environment because
[1:24:23] remember woman represents a church right
[1:24:25] so moms we should create an atmosphere
[1:24:27] at home that's like church where where
[1:24:30] kids when they come or people when they
[1:24:31] come they know what you're like at home
[1:24:33] the atmosphere you create the
[1:24:34] hospitality the love the care all those
[1:24:37] things the wisdom the guidance all those
[1:24:38] things that they have at home when they
[1:24:40] come to church they see this is just an
[1:24:42] extension of
[1:24:46] mom we got a
[1:24:49] job they all going to come
[1:24:52] home but remember it's whoo will will
[1:24:54] cross Jordan so don't beat yourself up
[1:24:57] it's whosoever
[1:24:58] will right they have to will but they're
[1:25:01] going to come I believe
[1:25:03] it
[1:25:05] amen but you see
[1:25:08] now the a big a big part of the church
[1:25:11] now is that we must never ever settle
[1:25:15] that our children have a different
[1:25:17] experience in Christ than
[1:25:18] us right the first generation comes in
[1:25:21] the fire is lit it happens all different
[1:25:24] ways but the fire falls they have a true
[1:25:26] Pentecostal experience where God comes
[1:25:28] and dwells in them I trust I'm not
[1:25:30] boring you with these things amen like
[1:25:32] like they on the day of Pentecost they
[1:25:33] are filled with the Holy Ghost and now
[1:25:35] the works of the church were that every
[1:25:38] generation would have the same
[1:25:40] experience that it wouldn't become
[1:25:42] anything different sure it may manifest
[1:25:43] in a different way amen but the life of
[1:25:46] God comes into that person and their
[1:25:48] life changes the word puts on flesh
[1:25:51] right and so as Joshua was commanded now
[1:25:54] before he crossed Jordan that the
[1:25:56] younger ones there's got to be another
[1:25:57] circumcision happened there's got to be
[1:26:00] a c you know a commandment went forth
[1:26:02] circumcised again that the same
[1:26:04] experience that the fathers had now the
[1:26:07] sons would have this is what we're got
[1:26:09] to we're always got to ensure that the
[1:26:13] god that saved you and I the god that
[1:26:15] lives in you and I will now live in our
[1:26:17] children this is the true church this is
[1:26:18] the work of the true church that the
[1:26:20] fire doesn't diminish amen that's it's
[1:26:22] not that well they're just racing church
[1:26:24] and now they're good people listen it's
[1:26:26] you know us that came out of the world
[1:26:29] God had to deliver us of many things but
[1:26:32] then the final thing he has to deliver
[1:26:33] us from is from ourselves there's got to
[1:26:36] be a death to self amen where it's no
[1:26:38] longer I that liveth but Christ that
[1:26:40] liveth in me and that's a thing that
[1:26:41] those who are raised in church they need
[1:26:43] that same experience when they come to a
[1:26:45] place Lord deliver me from my sin nature
[1:26:47] I'm born with Lord Lord take Save Me
[1:26:50] From Myself Lord that you can come and
[1:26:51] dwell in me and change my life
[1:26:55] praise God that's why we want to
[1:26:57] remember our CH I'm sure I said it on
[1:26:59] last Sunday but our children deserve a
[1:27:02] holy ghost
[1:27:04] Revival they deserve it they don't
[1:27:07] deserve churchianity and politics and
[1:27:09] fussing and fighting and chewing they
[1:27:11] deserve the power of God living in their
[1:27:13] lives amen that's what God gave us why
[1:27:15] should it be different for them you say
[1:27:17] well we're more a number and this and
[1:27:19] things have happened but he's still the
[1:27:21] same God he's still the same one he
[1:27:23] hasn't changed one
[1:27:25] bit
[1:27:27] amen praise the
[1:27:29] Lord now the now the Levites they had to
[1:27:32] carry the word over their hearts not in
[1:27:34] their head but their hearts this is why
[1:27:37] if you if you're carrying the word in
[1:27:39] your heart then you will you will give
[1:27:41] your life
[1:27:42] completely yeah and and the Lord will
[1:27:45] live sorry for this reading says my
[1:27:46] brother don't miss this my sisters you
[1:27:48] who want to be woman preacher so forth
[1:27:49] don't miss this no matter how much your
[1:27:51] anointing is you've got to get in God's
[1:27:53] provider um position David's anointing
[1:27:56] was all right but in doing what he did
[1:27:57] he got enthused and stepped over the
[1:27:59] boundary line that's when he put the Ark
[1:28:00] on a cart right a new cart that's what
[1:28:02] he's talking about here what did he do
[1:28:04] he stepped over the boundary line
[1:28:05] instead of putting the Ark in its
[1:28:06] original position he carried it on a new
[1:28:09] cart and not over the hearts of the
[1:28:10] Levites it was supposed to be carried on
[1:28:12] the shoulders of the Levites which is
[1:28:14] over the heart the word is not in the
[1:28:15] mind it's in the heart not on a new cart
[1:28:17] what was it some represented something
[1:28:19] new David did there spoke of every
[1:28:21] denomination ever be God's word is not
[1:28:23] carried by by state prors or Bishops and
[1:28:26] so forth of of denominations it's the
[1:28:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart
[1:28:30] of man and not in some ecclesiastical
[1:28:32] move the holy spirit is a treasure of
[1:28:35] God's love in the heart of man and woman
[1:28:36] to obey see amen so instructed to carry
[1:28:39] it carry it over our hearts why
[1:28:43] because we have to stand in Jordan that
[1:28:47] will create an entrance for the people
[1:28:48] I'm going to I'm going to wrap this up
[1:28:51] soon amen now
[1:28:54] what is this message of this church we
[1:28:56] said earlier about go preach in his name
[1:28:58] repentance remission of
[1:29:00] sin the message of the church is Jesus
[1:29:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:29:05] forever amen
[1:29:08] amen living in the church the king of
[1:29:10] the church raised from the dead the same
[1:29:12] yesterday today and forever performing
[1:29:14] the same Works doing the same things
[1:29:16] that Jesus did that's the message of the
[1:29:17] church if the church isn't teaching that
[1:29:19] it's teaching some false theology that's
[1:29:22] where Jesus commanded that's what Jesus
[1:29:24] commanded them to preach he's the
[1:29:26] same
[1:29:28] amen praise the Lord as Paul would Paul
[1:29:32] would say he all he determined to know
[1:29:35] anything among you speaking of the
[1:29:36] Corinthians it was save Jesus Christ and
[1:29:39] him crucified that's the message of the
[1:29:41] church all we should see is Jesus Christ
[1:29:43] and him crucified what happens when he
[1:29:45] got crucified his his Spirit got
[1:29:47] released right so when you only have
[1:29:49] Jesus Christ and him crucified in the
[1:29:51] people what he have the Holy Ghost on
[1:29:53] display Play Amen you have his word
[1:29:56] living amen that's no longer them but
[1:29:58] it's the the people become a living
[1:30:00] walking talking
[1:30:02] Bible amen you say that's impossible
[1:30:06] with you it is impossible but if you let
[1:30:09] God do it it's a guarantee more than
[1:30:13] just possible it's a
[1:30:15] guarantee
[1:30:17] amen so I'm just going to wrap this up
[1:30:19] with
[1:30:20] this brother ask a question you say Well
[1:30:23] I'm a Christian I'm glad but he asked a
[1:30:26] question don't he says always don't
[1:30:28] judge your life by how much power you
[1:30:30] have to perform
[1:30:31] Miracles and we don't judge ourselves by
[1:30:34] how much knowledge we have of the word
[1:30:35] but always judge yourself look back and
[1:30:38] take inventory of what kind of a fruit
[1:30:40] that your life you pre presently live
[1:30:43] now is
[1:30:44] bearing what is your life producing now
[1:30:47] is it a sweetness is it a love is it a
[1:30:51] joy is it a faith is it or is it stress
[1:30:56] and troubles and reasoning and complexes
[1:30:59] what is your life now currently
[1:31:01] presenting we got to take inventory I've
[1:31:03] got to take inventory we've got a job to
[1:31:06] do as the Church of the Living
[1:31:09] God now brother R would tell brother R
[1:31:12] would tell a story of a of a young
[1:31:15] boy that he had never seen a Mur before
[1:31:18] he lived out in the country he went into
[1:31:20] town he stayed with his auntie and one
[1:31:23] day
[1:31:24] this this boy he walked past this door
[1:31:27] that was closed and he
[1:31:29] looked and he saw a little
[1:31:32] boy and now this door had a ful length
[1:31:34] mirror on it so this boy looked at this
[1:31:37] boy and it looked a lot like him and he
[1:31:39] waved and the boy waved and he jumped
[1:31:42] and the boy jumped all at the same time
[1:31:44] perfectly synchronized and he walked up
[1:31:47] to the boy cuz he wanted to touch him to
[1:31:49] see if he was you know to see if he you
[1:31:51] know what he felt like and then he
[1:31:53] realized when he touched the mirror he
[1:31:55] looked back and said Mama that's
[1:31:58] me that's me
[1:32:02] now I want to ask you the question
[1:32:04] because we all have mirrors we look
[1:32:06] through or look into a lot of people
[1:32:09] have their own understanding as a mirror
[1:32:11] or their own reasoning mixed with
[1:32:13] scripture of course and
[1:32:15] quotes but is it the pure mirror of the
[1:32:18] word of God that your reasoning is gone
[1:32:22] your ideas are gone that it's just you
[1:32:24] say Lord I want to be a reflection of
[1:32:27] your
[1:32:28] word that when my life is held up to
[1:32:30] this mirror I can say mama it's
[1:32:40] me we must let ourselves be changed by
[1:32:43] the
[1:32:44] word we must do it cuz we don't not we
[1:32:48] don't want to get there on that day and
[1:32:51] realize we've been looking in a false
[1:32:52] mirror
[1:32:55] I'm sorry these things gone serious but
[1:32:57] we must be said Lord when I look into
[1:33:00] your word may I see my
[1:33:02] life not as a Pharisee or a sadducee or
[1:33:05] a make believer or an unbeliever but
[1:33:07] Lord what you describe a real believer
[1:33:09] to
[1:33:10] be may may I see my life now see see
[1:33:13] what fruit are we bearing I'm in the
[1:33:15] message that means nothing that really
[1:33:18] means nothing to God but are you under
[1:33:21] the blood as your life produces his word
[1:33:25] are you letting it if you're not letting
[1:33:28] it you're looking through a wrong mirror
[1:33:30] because Jesus nothing could stop
[1:33:33] him then nothing can stop you
[1:33:36] manifesting the word allotted to you for
[1:33:38] this
[1:33:42] age then you say well I don't know if my
[1:33:44] mirror is right I don't think that that
[1:33:46] sweetness is gone I just feel hard and
[1:33:49] callous and I just don't care and I want
[1:33:51] to do my own thing well I say sadly
[1:33:54] you say well then what what can I do to
[1:33:56] get that back you've got to go find him
[1:33:58] where you left
[1:34:00] him like Mary and Joseph remember they
[1:34:02] left Jesus at in Jerusalem they
[1:34:05] journeyed three days they presumed that
[1:34:07] Jesus was with them but they looked
[1:34:09] around they realized he wasn't there
[1:34:12] where did they find him where they left
[1:34:14] him I say
[1:34:17] friends if you want to be this for your
[1:34:22] family go find the we left
[1:34:24] him maybe it was an argument maybe it
[1:34:26] was in a fuss maybe it was in trouble I
[1:34:29] don't know but go back to that point
[1:34:32] because he's waiting for you
[1:34:36] there I'm just going to leave it there
[1:34:39] today maybe I haven't even touched my
[1:34:41] subject I don't know but friends let's
[1:34:43] have the musicians please you to come
[1:34:45] forward you'll find them where you left
[1:34:48] him don't just walk around presuming
[1:34:50] he's with you what's your life producing
[1:34:55] is it producing the fruits of the spirit
[1:34:57] oh you don't know my background you
[1:34:59] don't know where I've come from that's
[1:35:01] irrelevant God is greater than all those
[1:35:03] things there's no case in this building
[1:35:06] right now or those who are watching
[1:35:08] there's no case no background no
[1:35:09] circumstance that God says yeah you're
[1:35:12] right I can't do that no he can fix
[1:35:14] anyone he can change anything but we've
[1:35:17] got to be willing Lord change me to
[1:35:19] match your word Lord because I want to
[1:35:22] be a true represent ation of a Christian
