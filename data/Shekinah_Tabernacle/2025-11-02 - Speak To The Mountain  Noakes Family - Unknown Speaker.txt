TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Why would I worry when giants come calling [music and singing] my name? My God [music] is so much bigger [singing] than the troubles I face. Why would I hunger for powers and riches or [singing] fame? My God is so [music] much better than all of these things. I won't be shaking. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I speak to the mountains. [singing] Oh, it's time [music] to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger, [singing] greater than you. My enemies scatter cuz they know the battle is done. My God is stronger. The victory is already won. He died for my ransom. He rose up on the third day. Oh my God is greater than death and hell and the grave. I won't [music] be shen. I won't be moved. My God is [singing] faithful. His promise [music] is true. So I speak to the mountains. [singing] Oh, it's time to [music] move. Cuz my God [music and singing] is bigger, better, stronger, greater [music] than you. So I speak, there's no mountain to high, no valley [singing] to low. There's no fear that I have. He doesn't already know. [music and singing] There's no problem to be. There's no weapon too strong. There [singing] is nothing [music] for God that's impossible. True. I won't be moved.
