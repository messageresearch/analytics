[46:34] what it's this is a biblical story it's
[46:36] just not written in the Bible but yeah
[46:38] oh my goodness if there was another
[46:40] Bible being written this will be in it
[46:42] this is like a story of of God's
[46:45] judgment on Pride and human beings got
[46:48] too proud and this is what happens but
[46:51] don't just put it off in the history
[46:53] because we can be that Titanic too
[46:55] yeah and it can happen in our lives even
[46:57] as Believers message Believers that's
[47:00] when no one's exempt from this
[47:02] hallelujah amen so Titanic Pride shall
[47:06] near prevail
[47:08] Hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles to
[47:10] Genesis 11 1-5 amen and
[47:15] yeah
[47:17] I'm just moved
[47:18] who's moved by the guard amen I just
[47:22] want you to be movable tonight you know
[47:24] movable in in an encouragement way
[47:26] movable to co-hire not movable to get Go
[47:30] off into the world or into something
[47:32] else but movable by God to take you
[47:34] higher who's ready to go higher amen
[47:38] and the whole earth was of one language
[47:40] and of one speech
[47:43] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[47:46] from the East that they found a plane in
[47:48] the land of China and they dwelt there
[47:52] and they said one to another go to let
[47:55] us make brick and burn them thoroughly
[47:58] and they had breakfast Stone and slam
[48:01] their head for Mortar
[48:02] now this is here it says here in verse 4
[48:05] and they said go to let us build us see
[48:09] there's a very selfish thing going on
[48:11] here
[48:12] Amen Let Us build us a city and a tower
[48:15] whose top May reach unto heaven let us
[48:18] make us a name that's a very this is a
[48:22] very significant thing now this when
[48:25] this happens this God puts a stop to it
[48:28] but there is a time in which we're in
[48:30] now where God's not going to put a stop
[48:32] to it's going to go worse and worse and
[48:33] worse until Satan's in the flesh but we
[48:35] won't go there but that's what that's
[48:37] what was about to happen here and God
[48:39] stopped it and he stopped it many times
[48:41] over the ages so it says here lest we be
[48:43] scattered aboard upon the face of the
[48:45] earth and the Lord came down to see the
[48:48] city and the tower which the Lord which
[48:51] the children of men build it amen you
[48:53] may be seated God can add the blessing
[48:56] to the reading of his word amen
[48:58] hallelujah I'll just read here now I
[49:01] just mentioned that and it was just
[49:03] something that struck me so deeply but
[49:04] it's not it's just a thought that's
[49:07] going to complement the main thought
[49:09] which is the fact that at the Tower of
[49:12] Babel Lucifer begin to rise inside the
[49:16] human race
[49:17] he began to manifest in their thoughts
[49:20] in their imaginations again you know God
[49:22] cut it down at the flood he when when
[49:25] the flood happened because Lucifer began
[49:27] to build himself up in the human race he
[49:29] began to manifest himself in Babylonian
[49:31] religions and and imaginations of evil
[49:33] and all these things and so it got cut
[49:36] down because it wasn't time for the
[49:38] fullness of iniquity does anyone know
[49:40] what the fullness of iniquity is the
[49:42] fullness of iniquity is When sin can't
[49:44] get any worse it has its cap on it and
[49:46] it cannot get worse so every time the
[49:48] fullness of iniquity comes what that
[49:51] comes through is pride
[49:52] that's the pride of humanity and it's
[49:55] Lucifer's pride and when Lucifer's pride
[49:58] gets into the people the people begin to
[50:00] trust in themselves that's why it's so
[50:03] dangerous when you trust in yourself
[50:07] amen it's so dangerous and every time it
[50:10] happens on a we're talking now we're
[50:12] reading things that happening on an age
[50:13] level or on a dispensational level but
[50:16] here and in this one I'm about to read
[50:18] is happening on a national level and
[50:20] he's speaking to a King but he's
[50:21] actually speaking to Lucifer and he's
[50:23] telling Lucifer that this is what's
[50:25] going to happen but actually you'll see
[50:27] this there's a there's a very
[50:28] interesting parallel here with the
[50:30] Titanic story as well and actually let
[50:34] me just say it now that the Titanic the
[50:36] time of the Titanic after in the in the
[50:39] peak of the Industrial Revolution
[50:40] mankind got to the same point they were
[50:43] at at the Tower of Babel that Lucifer
[50:45] begin to manifest himself in human
[50:47] beings and and God was not ready to let
[50:49] the cut of iniquity fill up until the
[50:51] point of no return
[50:53] but at the day we're living in now that
[50:55] cat is going to fill to the top and it's
[50:58] going to go Lucifer will become flesh
[51:00] and he will manifest himself on the
[51:01] earth it's already in motion it's
[51:03] already near it's it's right there
[51:06] right there that's so bad and yet let's
[51:09] not get acclimatized to it Yeah the more
[51:12] you watch of it the more you partake of
[51:13] it the more you will get acclimatized to
[51:15] it and it will become not so abrasive to
[51:18] you it'll become not so hard for you to
[51:20] look at and then you become it becomes
[51:22] easy for you to to bear with it but let
[51:25] that not become your portion
[51:28] amen so I just wanted to bring that
[51:30] thought there because it was going to
[51:32] very much tie into the thought later on
[51:34] so Ezekiel 28 verse 2 it says son of man
[51:37] say unto the prince of Tyrus thus saith
[51:40] the Lord God because thine heart is
[51:42] lifted up and thou has said I am a god
[51:46] I sit in the seat of God in the midst of
[51:49] the Seas and sees in the Bible as
[51:51] kindreds Nations and tongues so here you
[51:54] have now the spirit that's coming to
[51:56] manifest itself in Kindred tongues and
[51:59] Nations and peoples and masses of people
[52:01] it's the spirit of Lucifer and it comes
[52:04] through pride and it's Pride that the
[52:07] devil uses to take people from God
[52:09] because they rely on themselves and
[52:11] what's in men a luciferian nature
[52:15] without the Holy Ghost without the new
[52:17] birth you have a luciferian nature and
[52:20] all that can happen is Lucifer will
[52:21] manifest himself in you or you'll be a
[52:23] legalistic Pharisee it's the only two
[52:25] options
[52:27] so you need the Holy Ghost
[52:29] and the only thing that's going to stop
[52:31] you getting the Holy Ghost is pride
[52:33] because you're not willing to let God
[52:35] heal that gash in your ship
[52:37] all right we're going to get to that
[52:38] soon hallelujah amen son of man oh we
[52:43] were in the midst of the sea so get thou
[52:45] art a man and not God though thou set
[52:48] thine heart as the heart of God now
[52:50] we're moving down to verse four it says
[52:53] therefore thus saith the Lord God
[52:55] because thou has set thine heart as the
[52:57] heart of God behold therefore I will
[53:00] bring strangers upon thee the terrible
[53:03] of the Nations and they shall draw their
[53:05] swords against the beauty of thy wisdom
[53:07] and they shall defile thy brightness
[53:09] they shall bring thee down to the pit
[53:12] and thou shalt die the deaths of them
[53:14] that are slain in the midst of the Seas
[53:17] amen I won't um comment on that any
[53:20] further but here I'd just like to know
[53:22] that you are I'd like to tell you right
[53:24] now and this is that I believe that
[53:26] scripture speaking of our age and I
[53:28] believe it speaking of today Hallelujah
[53:31] and it's a promise over you I like this
[53:33] sort of Promise who likes these promises
[53:35] over them it's just over you it's in you
[53:37] it's through you it's for you
[53:39] all you need to do is humble yourself
[53:41] and it will affect you
[53:43] God's compassionate against you for you
[53:45] compassion is when you're acting upon
[53:48] empathy it's not just sympathy that
[53:51] sympathizes in the mind about how bad it
[53:53] is that you got it or empathy that
[53:55] really it actually enters into the
[53:57] burden but compassion is the action upon
[53:59] the burden that's when you really act
[54:01] and God is compassionate towards you
[54:03] but he can't act if you're proud
[54:06] and I'm talking to all of us we're all
[54:09] in it none of us are exempt none of us
[54:11] if we are then we're on the wrong we're
[54:13] we're right where we shouldn't be we
[54:16] should be actually going Lord help me
[54:18] right now
[54:19] amen hallelujah pride is the only thing
[54:22] that can really stop you you know and
[54:25] stop you from growing stop me from
[54:27] taking your position stop God from
[54:29] healing you because he wants to bind up
[54:32] the breach of his people
[54:33] and heal the stroke of their wound and I
[54:37] want to carry this thought right through
[54:39] this whole sermon right now though we're
[54:41] going to go for a little bit of a
[54:43] history lesson because I was so moved by
[54:45] this I'll just say a couple of read a
[54:47] couple of quotes here just to build a
[54:49] foundation on what brother Branham has
[54:50] actually said about these things he says
[54:52] and if you'll get behind it
[54:54] it's the same motive that was at the
[54:57] Tower of Babel to build a man-made
[54:59] Earthly Dominion but God don't want that
[55:02] this is about the Tower of Babel button
[55:03] watch this now the Tara Babel is still
[55:05] here the unbelieving world walks along
[55:08] and grows Darkness around some Tower of
[55:11] Babel now we know the Tower of Babel not
[55:13] only stands for the pride of man and the
[55:16] Lucifer raising up to basically try and
[55:19] override judgment but it also stands for
[55:21] all the religions of the world
[55:24] and all denominationalism all
[55:26] Catholicism is rooted in the Tower of
[55:28] Babel all Eastern mythology all taoism
[55:31] or Buddhism all of that new age rubbish
[55:33] is all rooted in this Tower of Babel and
[55:36] that's why when it came to a certain
[55:38] point God had to to confuse their
[55:40] languages to stifle the connection right
[55:44] there because it wasn't time for the
[55:45] iniquity cup to be full it wasn't time
[55:47] for Lucifer to be made flesh
[55:50] amen
[55:52] Hallelujah are you with me amen brother
[55:56] Branham says here so they was crossing
[55:58] the ocean in the ship on its voyage
[56:02] this is the similarities now between the
[56:04] Tower of Babel and the Titanic and
[56:06] feeling so secure that there was nothing
[56:09] could harm them why did they build the
[56:11] Tower so high it was to avoid the
[56:13] another flood
[56:14] why do you think these people these
[56:16] these false religions build their
[56:18] religion so high to try and avoid
[56:20] judgment but they die in their sins and
[56:23] they go to hell there's no hope for them
[56:25] no hope
[56:27] do you believe that absolutely no hope
[56:29] all they'll have is a philosophy and
[56:31] they'll get into some Nirvana State on
[56:32] the earth because of all their their the
[56:34] canceling of the flesh by their own
[56:37] Works in their own mind
[56:39] but they'll go to hell because they're
[56:41] too proud to accept the Simplicity of
[56:43] Christ
[56:46] oh God help us Lord and help them you
[56:48] see it's not it's not a bad people it's
[56:51] just the fact that man is proud and he's
[56:53] trusting in himself but we should not
[56:55] trust in ourselves we should never trust
[56:58] in our own flesh and our own ability in
[57:00] our own intellect and our search like
[57:03] don't get me wrong don't trust in your
[57:05] ability to search the scriptures and
[57:06] compare them all together to try and get
[57:08] Deliverance it has to be a meeting with
[57:10] Christ
[57:11] Hallelujah and finding the source of
[57:14] strength is in him and and God uses
[57:16] people too so when you humble yourself
[57:18] you're able to become a beneficiary of
[57:21] the gifts in the body
[57:23] to be a benefactor but when we get proud
[57:26] we close off or we don't receive
[57:30] that's very much something that we need
[57:32] to look at and and consider our ways
[57:34] Hallelujah
[57:37] um so here look at this on the Titanic
[57:40] it says here they throwed a big drunken
[57:43] party and all the women and the men
[57:45] abroad or maybe many many of them I
[57:48] might say became drunk even they say
[57:51] even the pilot and the captain and all
[57:53] of them
[57:56] and the bands began to whoop up the jazz
[57:58] music
[57:59] which was the great fad of that day
[58:02] as we have rock and roll today and
[58:04] obviously it's further on now
[58:06] because they were safe
[58:08] they were safe right they were in a ship
[58:11] that man had given the world a sign of
[58:14] their intelligence
[58:16] so now we're now venturing into another
[58:18] kind of a revelation within this is the
[58:20] tree of knowledge
[58:21] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[58:23] this intelligence of man knowing
[58:25] everything and and being self-sufficient
[58:27] in science and the Industrial Revolution
[58:29] and it was it was coming to a peak in
[58:32] that day and they were trusting and they
[58:34] were starting to really move away from
[58:36] God
[58:37] and as a society as a as the whole world
[58:40] was moving far that this ship could take
[58:44] any wave or any sea
[58:48] Prophet says this
[58:50] we said that ship cannot be sunk it was
[58:53] called the Titanic we thought we had
[58:55] some we had did something we had
[58:58] achieved something in the marine life
[58:59] that no one could put their hand on that
[59:02] we had did something but on her voyage
[59:06] across the sea god with this powerful
[59:08] hand showed that what man tries to do
[59:11] will sink and fail
[59:14] he sunk it it was a Biblical Judgment of
[59:18] God and I just finished watching uh
[59:20] documentary by James Cameron which was
[59:22] called ghost of the abyss and he goes
[59:24] down and even they testify that it was a
[59:27] Biblical thing and they're not Christian
[59:29] at all but they're all saying this this
[59:31] is just a a story of biblical proportion
[59:34] and there actually I'll show you soon
[59:37] so can we play this video this is going
[59:39] to give us a five minute video I don't
[59:41] do we normally do this can we show a
[59:43] little video it's just it's basically
[59:45] very
[59:46] but it's just a quick overview
[59:49] is this sound oh good
[59:55] the industrial marvels of their age
[59:58] the largest machines on Earth
[1:00:01] when the owners of White Star Line
[1:00:03] commissioned the Titanic their Ambitions
[1:00:06] were every bit as large as their plans
[1:00:08] for the ship herself
[1:00:10] she was to be the biggest fastest most
[1:00:13] luxurious passenger liner ever built
[1:00:18] construction began at Harland and woof
[1:00:20] shipyards in the spring of 1909.
[1:00:23] the city of Belfast watched her groom
[1:00:25] and took pride in the Feats of
[1:00:28] engineering required to construct and
[1:00:30] fed out this giant vessel
[1:00:32] from her triple propellers to her
[1:00:35] elegant backswept funnels
[1:00:37] the Titanic was a sign of her times
[1:00:39] culture and commerce alike were hurtling
[1:00:42] forward into the Modern Age
[1:00:45] after just three years hard work she was
[1:00:48] finished
[1:00:49] floating city ready to welcome a whole
[1:00:52] community on board
[1:00:54] the passengers on her maiden voyage were
[1:00:57] drawn from all walks of life
[1:00:59] among the Gilded State rooms of first
[1:01:02] class silent film stars rubbed shoulders
[1:01:04] with millionaires further down in second
[1:01:07] class the quarters were compact but
[1:01:09] still comfortable housing School
[1:01:11] teachers small businessmen and the like
[1:01:13] and buried out of sight near the bottom
[1:01:16] of the ship the third class passengers
[1:01:18] included immigrants from all over Europe
[1:01:20] in search of a better life in the New
[1:01:23] World
[1:01:24] by the 11th of April the Titanic was on
[1:01:27] her way across the Atlantic
[1:01:29] hearing reports of ice from other liners
[1:01:32] playing this busy route Captain Smith
[1:01:34] plotted a new more southerly course and
[1:01:37] called for Full Speed Ahead
[1:01:40] on Sunday the 14th of April Titanic's
[1:01:43] radio operators received six further
[1:01:45] reports about icebergs in her path
[1:01:48] they were busy sending telegraphs on
[1:01:50] behalf of passengers and the final two
[1:01:52] warnings never reached the bridge
[1:01:54] that night the sea was flood calm the
[1:01:58] sky clear but moonless with temperatures
[1:02:00] dropping towards freezing
[1:02:02] in these conditions sea Ice is very hard
[1:02:06] to spot
[1:02:08] but at 11 40 PM the lookout sounded the
[1:02:12] alarm and a telephone call to the bridge
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:17] despite efforts to bring the ship around
[1:02:19] she struck the iceberg less than 40
[1:02:21] seconds later opening a long tear and
[1:02:25] the starboard Hull and sending the sea
[1:02:27] rushing in
[1:02:29] first the impact didn't strike the crew
[1:02:32] as anything too serious but by midnight
[1:02:35] the forward third class sections of the
[1:02:37] ship were beginning to flood and Captain
[1:02:40] Smith realized that the Titanic was in
[1:02:42] grave danger he ordered the lifeboats
[1:02:46] uncovered
[1:02:47] there were 20 lifeboats on board more
[1:02:50] than the law required but far too few to
[1:02:53] carry all the ship's passengers
[1:02:55] no one could imagine that a gigantic
[1:02:57] liner like the Titanic might sink before
[1:03:00] another ship came to the rescue and
[1:03:02] indeed the Titanic's crew could see the
[1:03:05] lights of another ship that night lying
[1:03:07] at anchor less than 20 miles away
[1:03:10] despite increasingly frantic efforts to
[1:03:12] make contact
[1:03:13] they got no response to their radio
[1:03:15] calls or distressed Flash
[1:03:18] the nearest ship that answered Titanic's
[1:03:20] SOS was the Carpathia
[1:03:23] her crew immediately set off to the
[1:03:25] rescue but she was four hours away even
[1:03:27] at frantic full speed
[1:03:32] cause of the shortage of lifeboats
[1:03:34] Captain Smith ordered women and children
[1:03:36] to board first
[1:03:38] the crew managed the evacuation as best
[1:03:40] they could in the confusion but many
[1:03:42] boots were launched half full
[1:03:45] third class passengers had to find their
[1:03:47] way through a maze of corridors and
[1:03:49] staircases to reach the boat deck
[1:03:52] just after 2 am the final Lifeboat was
[1:03:56] lowered the passengers still on board
[1:03:58] could see that the game was up
[1:04:01] Captain Smith relieved his man of their
[1:04:04] duties with the words every man for
[1:04:06] himself then returned to the bridge at
[1:04:10] around 2 20 am he went down with his
[1:04:12] ship
[1:04:15] by the time the Carpathia arrived to
[1:04:18] pick up the survivors more than 1500
[1:04:20] people had perished in the freezing
[1:04:22] water
[1:04:23] and the ship herself lay on the seabed
[1:04:25] almost four kilometers below
[1:04:28] less than a third of the third class
[1:04:30] passengers made it onto the list of
[1:04:32] survivors
[1:04:33] although the women and children first
[1:04:35] policy proved effective across all
[1:04:38] classes
[1:04:40] the Titanic was not the only disaster of
[1:04:42] its kind or even the deadliest
[1:04:45] but there is something about the story
[1:04:48] that still captures our imagination a
[1:04:50] century litter
[1:04:52] the way the tragedy slowly unfolds
[1:04:54] towards an inevitable ending
[1:04:56] the warnings it seems to offer about the
[1:04:58] limits of technology and the arrogance
[1:05:00] of man
[1:05:02] it's no wonder we have turned this
[1:05:04] unlucky ship into a legend
[1:05:12] we have to find ourselves
[1:05:15] identified with a similar situation in
[1:05:18] our own lives
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] 1500 people went down with that ship
[1:05:23] because they were so proud and so
[1:05:25] self-sufficient that they were unable to
[1:05:28] heed the warning or prepare
[1:05:31] and not only that as we go further on in
[1:05:34] the does this work yep
[1:05:36] as we go further on
[1:05:38] here's I'm just going to show you a few
[1:05:40] things because that was all animated you
[1:05:42] don't really get a connection to the
[1:05:44] um to the people remember these are
[1:05:46] people with families and lives and and
[1:05:49] very influential people in the world it
[1:05:51] was like the the Donald Trump of that
[1:05:53] day died on the ship and all these
[1:05:55] people and it was just a a Epic
[1:05:58] Proportion tragedy but you can see all
[1:06:00] these people here all leaving that was
[1:06:03] when they were leaving port
[1:06:05] there's the captain and his second first
[1:06:08] mate I think they're called
[1:06:09] um and some of the diner was one of the
[1:06:11] richest most luxurious
[1:06:14] liners to ever
[1:06:16] be on the sea that's the crew there
[1:06:18] there's the lifeboats those people
[1:06:20] walking along the lifeboats right there
[1:06:23] it's just the day that was taken the day
[1:06:26] they sunk there's a boy playing on the
[1:06:28] on the deck there down on the that was
[1:06:31] actually on the third class deck
[1:06:34] so here we are this is the ship sinking
[1:06:37] and you can see now I might just turn
[1:06:39] this way I feel like I'm in the way but
[1:06:41] like that's hard to see but like this
[1:06:44] these people in all these lifeboats were
[1:06:46] sitting around watching this massive
[1:06:49] ship break in front of them and people
[1:06:52] screaming can you imagine it just a
[1:06:55] horrific horrific like it's just you
[1:06:58] cannot you cannot put your imagination
[1:07:00] there too but if you put yourself in
[1:07:02] their shoes you'll realize the same if
[1:07:05] it can give you a little feeling of what
[1:07:07] it's like for a soul to be lost
[1:07:10] and for Pride to come into our lives to
[1:07:14] hinder us from healing from change from
[1:07:18] Deliverance
[1:07:19] from from our from an opportunity with
[1:07:22] God
[1:07:23] we must humble ourselves
[1:07:25] the more humble we can be collectively
[1:07:28] and individually
[1:07:29] the more God can use us in this in this
[1:07:31] Fellowship in this region
[1:07:33] powerful
[1:07:35] oh my it's not just so that you can have
[1:07:38] a healing it's so that God can use you
[1:07:40] hey man oh my
[1:07:42] God hallelujah so here you have now the
[1:07:45] ship it got so on it went up and the the
[1:07:48] weight of it broke it and there was
[1:07:50] thousands of people on this part
[1:07:53] 1500 people because you can imagine they
[1:07:55] were running up the ship to hold on to
[1:07:56] all this and that went right up
[1:08:00] and you can see here see where the ship
[1:08:03] now is actually half under the water
[1:08:05] there and thousands and thousands of
[1:08:07] people just sitting there watching this
[1:08:10] water come up that's what it's like for
[1:08:12] our lives and when we're watching people
[1:08:13] that are living in a in a way that
[1:08:17] yeah
[1:08:18] I'll get to a point there because it
[1:08:21] gets worse as soon as the water hits
[1:08:22] gets higher the higher it gets the
[1:08:24] faster it sinks
[1:08:27] you have some more pictures just to give
[1:08:30] you an idea of the the magnitude of the
[1:08:32] catastrophe that they faced here's the
[1:08:35] ship and all these thousands of people
[1:08:36] just swimming around in one degree water
[1:08:40] here it is now just about to go down
[1:08:43] 1500 people on board the ship
[1:08:46] these guys were the ones 730 of them
[1:08:48] were rescued and these are the lifeboats
[1:08:50] them at dawn the next day and the
[1:08:53] capathia ship they're on the capacia
[1:08:55] ship here
[1:08:56] this is the crowds of people there was
[1:08:58] thousands and thousands of people all
[1:09:00] the families you know that were waiting
[1:09:02] for their they didn't even know they
[1:09:04] didn't know who was dead or not the
[1:09:05] newspapers were in a frantic they were
[1:09:07] reporting oh the the Titanic that's okay
[1:09:10] it's getting towed in and some of them
[1:09:11] there was just so such a mix but all
[1:09:15] these people were waiting to know if
[1:09:17] their family was coming back
[1:09:19] and these people here they're all
[1:09:22] waiting outside the office waiting for
[1:09:23] news these people here are waiting for
[1:09:26] they had the news now they're waiting
[1:09:27] for the ship to come and can you imagine
[1:09:29] now this is the ship today
[1:09:31] this is down the bottom 3.8 kilometers
[1:09:35] down that's where the steering wheel was
[1:09:38] that was the bridge
[1:09:40] this is the stern or the bow sorry the
[1:09:42] bowel of the ship right where you know
[1:09:46] um people would have stood and watched
[1:09:48] the ship you know a ship as a type of a
[1:09:50] life that or as someone walking and
[1:09:53] you're dividing time with your life you
[1:09:56] know you're walking ahead you're if
[1:09:58] you're walking with God you're walking
[1:09:59] in his prophecy you're walking in his
[1:10:01] word you're dividing time you know it's
[1:10:03] one part's going that way one's going
[1:10:05] that way you're walking through it the
[1:10:06] ship is is like that
[1:10:08] it's going through its cutting and it's
[1:10:10] Majestic in its way but when there's
[1:10:12] Pride there's destruction because
[1:10:15] remember the Bible says Pride goes
[1:10:17] before destruction and a haughty spirit
[1:10:19] before the fall
[1:10:20] this was the captain's bathtub
[1:10:23] in his room this is the back of the ship
[1:10:25] it's hard to see but that they found
[1:10:28] everything that's all down there sitting
[1:10:29] down there now this lady here I just
[1:10:31] felt like we should just talk on her a
[1:10:33] little bit Helen candy a feminist she
[1:10:36] was a very early feminist a very
[1:10:38] independent woman and she set out in the
[1:10:41] world very influential millionaire from
[1:10:43] a very rich family and all that sort of
[1:10:45] stuff but she was uh set out to show
[1:10:48] that woman can you know basically live
[1:10:50] without men and be self-sufficient and
[1:10:53] do everything and so she actually is a
[1:10:56] very talented writer and some of the
[1:10:59] stuff that she wrote
[1:11:01] um she
[1:11:03] you know artists catch inspiration
[1:11:06] and so an artist can catch inspiration
[1:11:08] and be inspired by something and they
[1:11:11] can actually catch prophetic inspiration
[1:11:13] from situations and from things and so
[1:11:16] some of the stuff she said was very
[1:11:17] interesting she even when the ship went
[1:11:19] over the iceberg she even had a a vision
[1:11:23] of the Ark of Noah hitting Mount Ararat
[1:11:26] and you know this is like that's
[1:11:28] what she saw she's because you can
[1:11:30] imagine being on a ship and it's driving
[1:11:32] in the middle of the ocean and all you
[1:11:34] feel is
[1:11:35] that would make you think some pretty
[1:11:38] intense thoughts you know and she her
[1:11:41] mind went straight to biblical things
[1:11:43] and the it's interesting because just
[1:11:46] that morning she was on the bow of the
[1:11:48] ship basically Vin inspired by the pride
[1:11:52] of the Titanic and their in their
[1:11:54] ability of man and she even has there's
[1:11:57] a there's accounts of her saying that
[1:11:59] this ship might even be stronger than
[1:12:01] God and the moment she thought it she
[1:12:04] said a fear came over her and darkness
[1:12:06] and she got she was scared
[1:12:08] she felt something had changed and so
[1:12:11] this is this is her um
[1:12:14] this is her she says one morning I left
[1:12:16] my cabin early that gave me a chance to
[1:12:18] go to the bow alone Walnut which was a
[1:12:21] guy that was courting her or after her
[1:12:23] had developed a habit of going with me
[1:12:25] this time I tricked him and thus could
[1:12:27] have to ship the big ship to myself she
[1:12:30] impressed on me her personality as I
[1:12:32] stood at the bow alone that's the front
[1:12:35] of the ship alone way up there right on
[1:12:37] that you know I'll show you what it is
[1:12:39] it's there well that that that's kind of
[1:12:41] a rendition of her where she would have
[1:12:43] been standing and these guys James
[1:12:45] Cameron and his buddies were speaking
[1:12:47] the narration of what she was saying
[1:12:49] that's where I was like man it's crazy
[1:12:51] like she was embodying she was speaking
[1:12:53] for the ship she was speaking under
[1:12:55] inspiration the very Spirit of man and
[1:12:58] and self-sufficiency and pride that was
[1:13:01] that the ship was like this ship was
[1:13:03] like the personification of the pride of
[1:13:06] the Industrial Revolution the very head
[1:13:08] of it and she was standing there
[1:13:09] thinking this one morning oh I'll go
[1:13:11] down she impressed on me the ship now
[1:13:13] Titanic pressed on me her personality as
[1:13:16] I stood at the bow alone and absorbed
[1:13:19] her spirit
[1:13:20] she was a monarch of the Seas as her
[1:13:23] bowel cut into the waves throwing tons
[1:13:25] of water to the right and to the left
[1:13:27] though in light-hearted playful intent
[1:13:30] her indifference to mankind was
[1:13:32] significant in its utter self absorption
[1:13:37] it was only at the bow that I could
[1:13:39] appreciate her pride in her size how
[1:13:42] Grand she was how superb how Titanic
[1:13:46] oh my oh I was sure she liked her name
[1:13:50] it suited her Titanic which comes from
[1:13:53] Greek mythology
[1:13:55] the biggest ship afloat yet as I
[1:13:57] analyzed her I shivered with a sense of
[1:14:00] fear being myself overpowered and turned
[1:14:03] back into the regions where she kept
[1:14:06] Comforts for the land
[1:14:08] lovers not lovers but that's how they
[1:14:11] used to call them people that were not
[1:14:13] see men so she was saying I'm going back
[1:14:15] inside now because
[1:14:16] she got fearful and and actually like on
[1:14:19] the documentary they've got manuscripts
[1:14:21] and other things that that I think she
[1:14:23] goes further into it this one was
[1:14:25] published in a newspaper so I don't
[1:14:26] think she went right into the god stuff
[1:14:28] but
[1:14:29] um what they've read and I actually was
[1:14:31] with him yesterday and I was going to
[1:14:33] ask him but I forgot about it but I want
[1:14:34] to know where they read it you know I
[1:14:36] wanted to see if he got a copy of that
[1:14:37] manuscript but but he they mentioned
[1:14:41] that yeah she said that this ship is
[1:14:43] more powerful than God and the moment
[1:14:45] she thought it sorry thought it this
[1:14:48] fear came on her and that was the
[1:14:50] morning of the sinking
[1:14:54] pride and self-sufficiency
[1:14:56] Godless navigation
[1:14:58] this never you can imagine now
[1:15:01] this ship in all its pride is navigating
[1:15:04] a very dangerous sea all the variables
[1:15:07] all the storms all the icebergs and
[1:15:10] these icebergs you might see just the
[1:15:12] tip but underneath is where all the
[1:15:14] problems are under the water line under
[1:15:17] where you can see
[1:15:18] things that are in the Unseen realm as
[1:15:21] where all the the the problems can exist
[1:15:24] we all see with our eyes problems on the
[1:15:26] surface we see the iceberg sticking out
[1:15:28] and it might be something we're
[1:15:30] struggling with but it's actually what's
[1:15:31] underneath the effect of it and what can
[1:15:34] cause the real damage because if she was
[1:15:36] scratched on the top it's not going to
[1:15:38] make us sink this is going to be a sore
[1:15:40] it's going to be a pain it's going to be
[1:15:41] a bit of a trial but it's not going to
[1:15:42] be that bad but it's the it's what's
[1:15:44] happening in the Unseen realm when you
[1:15:46] go into those things and you're
[1:15:48] navigating the sea and you're navigating
[1:15:50] the Sea of life without God or in your
[1:15:53] own Pride you could be baptized with the
[1:15:55] Holy Ghost even and and get proud you
[1:15:58] know that you can start getting proud
[1:16:00] about things and God will begin to work
[1:16:01] and what happens is you're navigating a
[1:16:04] sea in your own strength in your own
[1:16:06] pride and you're going to hit it if you
[1:16:08] and there's icebergs everywhere and
[1:16:09] there's Devils ten thousand of them will
[1:16:11] swear to drown you who wants to navigate
[1:16:14] the sea without God who wants to
[1:16:16] navigate the sea proud and in their own
[1:16:18] sufficiency not me
[1:16:20] not me oh my give me God or give me uh
[1:16:24] take me away take me to Heaven Lord I
[1:16:27] don't want to go in Pride and I believe
[1:16:29] tonight is a night we can just say Lord
[1:16:30] I'm humbling myself Lord I'm just
[1:16:33] letting all my self-sufficiency go I'm
[1:16:36] not I'm not going to hold on to anything
[1:16:37] that I am in my own self
[1:16:42] because I don't want a Godless
[1:16:43] navigation and they were on a Godless
[1:16:46] navigation and as she thought that it
[1:16:48] was like she was and you know people in
[1:16:50] the world have prophetic gifts they can
[1:16:52] they can see things and catch stuff and
[1:16:55] do and and feel inspiration and I
[1:16:57] believe that she was at the bow of that
[1:16:58] ship and she was inspired by the devil
[1:17:02] to think those thoughts and she
[1:17:04] culminated in almost in a negative way
[1:17:07] prophesied the very heart of the people
[1:17:10] where they were going
[1:17:11] and here we have a Biblical judgment
[1:17:14] strike in such a way and it wasn't just
[1:17:17] anything it was this was the the elite
[1:17:20] was on there
[1:17:22] the elite of the world at that time was
[1:17:24] on that ship carousing and drunken and
[1:17:28] you know it reminds me of belshazzar and
[1:17:30] his feast in Babylon getting all drunk
[1:17:32] and getting out of hand and beginning to
[1:17:34] get so proud
[1:17:36] so proud that he began to take the
[1:17:38] vessels of Jehovah and drink wine and
[1:17:41] mockery
[1:17:43] and judgment came because it was the cup
[1:17:46] of iniquity who God had enough
[1:17:48] and there's a time where God has enough
[1:17:51] but where how far do you need to be
[1:17:54] brought
[1:17:55] for you to surrender Pride and I'm
[1:17:58] speaking on that camera too you're
[1:18:00] hiding behind that screen Somewhere Out
[1:18:01] There Pride it's time to humble yourself
[1:18:04] Hallelujah
[1:18:07] amen time because we don't want to
[1:18:09] navigate ourself we have a captain a man
[1:18:12] he's more than an admiral he's a he's
[1:18:15] just whoever said it I think it was
[1:18:16] about a seven star general not just a
[1:18:19] five-star we got a seven star general
[1:18:22] that's the one I want navigating my life
[1:18:24] and if I'm proud how can he navigate
[1:18:27] I find himself sufficient how can he do
[1:18:29] it he's not going to override me I'm
[1:18:32] gonna have to humble myself with all my
[1:18:34] heart so that he can navigate me through
[1:18:36] for cease because there's icebergs on
[1:18:39] this ocean we're in Satan's Eden now all
[1:18:42] things have been loosed out hell's come
[1:18:45] up on the earth does everyone know that
[1:18:48] how come on the Earth it's all the
[1:18:50] icebergs are out everywhere and they're
[1:18:52] very small on the top lust after this
[1:18:55] having a good career doing all these
[1:18:58] things that looks so innocent but they
[1:19:00] can be a thing underneath it can take
[1:19:01] you from God take you away can distract
[1:19:03] you
[1:19:04] Pride
[1:19:06] and all the things that you want to
[1:19:08] navigate through all this whole sea well
[1:19:10] don't let me do it without Jesus Christ
[1:19:13] Hallelujah so here we have now now
[1:19:15] remember
[1:19:16] we are receiving warnings
[1:19:19] it's warning time Hallelujah now I'm
[1:19:23] talking collectively but you know in
[1:19:24] your own life where your ship is right
[1:19:26] now
[1:19:27] our ships are all in space all in
[1:19:30] different spaces we're all going through
[1:19:32] things
[1:19:32] there's times where our ship is just
[1:19:34] sailing good
[1:19:35] and there's times where we've hit an
[1:19:37] iceberg there's times when we've hit
[1:19:39] things and I'll show you something soon
[1:19:41] but unheeded warnings when you hear
[1:19:43] something when God begins to speak to
[1:19:45] you it's time to act
[1:19:47] don't don't just just heed the warnings
[1:19:50] these telegraphs came through as you
[1:19:52] read who remembers what it said it said
[1:19:54] that there was they were too busy
[1:19:57] they were sending social telegrams for
[1:20:00] all the Rich and Famous to and they were
[1:20:03] all they were like these things were
[1:20:04] coming through there and they were just
[1:20:06] saying just wait
[1:20:08] oh my just wait
[1:20:13] they they two of them I think got
[1:20:15] through us three or whatever got through
[1:20:16] to the captain
[1:20:18] and they kind of just altered course a
[1:20:19] little bit but then more came and it was
[1:20:21] like they're everywhere these are
[1:20:22] icebergs everywhere
[1:20:24] and I'm telling you now
[1:20:26] warning icebergs everywhere and they and
[1:20:30] they're getting smaller and smaller
[1:20:31] because the sun shines so bright now but
[1:20:34] there's a big thing under the ocean and
[1:20:36] the ocean's dark
[1:20:37] the Steve the seas are dark and there's
[1:20:40] big spikes underneath the sand you can't
[1:20:42] see them but we have a seven star
[1:20:44] general that can and he wants to guide
[1:20:47] you and he's giving warnings after
[1:20:48] warnings after warnings and he's saying
[1:20:51] just humble yourself so that God can
[1:20:53] heal you so that God can change you so
[1:20:56] that God can take you higher who wants
[1:20:58] to go higher I want to go higher I want
[1:21:00] to be further I want to be deeper with
[1:21:01] Christ Hallelujah
[1:21:04] Hallelujah I want my ship to stay afloat
[1:21:06] and to be will stabilizers on it amen
[1:21:10] the prophet said the stabilizers are on
[1:21:12] the ship who wants stabilizers on their
[1:21:14] ship so that you can stay steady and
[1:21:17] you've got a seven star captain in the
[1:21:19] Helm of the ship and he's driving you
[1:21:21] not some proud arrogant man-made idea
[1:21:27] that's too proud and it's not
[1:21:29] necessarily the idea in history it's you
[1:21:31] that's holding it
[1:21:33] we got to be very careful
[1:21:35] it's all in love right unheated warnings
[1:21:38] they had unheated warnings this
[1:21:39] apparently the next day they found this
[1:21:42] this is the iceberg that did it
[1:21:44] and you can see I'm going to just go
[1:21:45] from here that's I mean these are these
[1:21:47] photos are pretty you know these cameras
[1:21:49] weren't like the cameras they're not add
[1:21:51] cannons so this here it's hard to see it
[1:21:54] but they this is all the paint of the
[1:21:56] ship on here
[1:21:57] and underneath now is like it would be
[1:22:00] like massive you know massive only a
[1:22:03] certain 10 is above the ground
[1:22:05] the rest of it's bubbling inside the ice
[1:22:07] cold water with big spikes ready to to
[1:22:10] hit ships and make them sink
[1:22:13] so one of the first things they had was
[1:22:15] their binoculars were inaccessible
[1:22:16] because of a whole confusion and a guy
[1:22:19] got laid off and he took the key in so
[1:22:21] they had no vision
[1:22:24] they couldn't get into the cabinet they
[1:22:25] had the binoculars and because they were
[1:22:27] so proud they didn't think they were
[1:22:29] going to have any trouble so they didn't
[1:22:30] there was no they had no fear
[1:22:34] now this isn't a natural thing natural
[1:22:36] fear but no we need to have a fear of
[1:22:38] God
[1:22:39] don't fear them that can kill your body
[1:22:41] but fear Him who can kill your body and
[1:22:44] your soul
[1:22:46] I know that sounds like you know the
[1:22:48] opposite of of Grace but it's not
[1:22:50] because God has got a provision for us
[1:22:52] right now to come out of the water to
[1:22:54] come out of a sinking ship
[1:22:56] and come into the Super Zion
[1:22:59] amen so look they had no vision they
[1:23:02] couldn't see clearly because they were
[1:23:04] they were floating past and pride and
[1:23:07] and their own man-made ability and they
[1:23:11] they were they didn't even have a fear
[1:23:13] enough to be extra precautionary even
[1:23:15] the captain that didn't even run a they
[1:23:18] never had done a a you know like a
[1:23:20] rehearsal of the boats the the safety
[1:23:23] boats they never even did it they were
[1:23:25] meant to and it never happened and
[1:23:27] they're all like I wonder why this
[1:23:28] didn't happen Pride yeah so proud in the
[1:23:31] Industrial Revolution and the
[1:23:32] achievement of man here they were about
[1:23:35] to hop in a Tower of Babel
[1:23:37] they were climbing the Tower of Babel
[1:23:39] they were sailing in the epitome of
[1:23:42] man's ability and Satan was inside the
[1:23:45] whole thing
[1:23:46] enjoying every moment
[1:23:48] and you know what's interesting very
[1:23:50] interesting and you can look it up and I
[1:23:52] didn't put it in here but a book was
[1:23:53] written 11 years earlier that describes
[1:23:56] the very event
[1:23:58] to the ship to the name of the ship
[1:24:00] everything so there was something that's
[1:24:03] crazy but someone called an inspiration
[1:24:06] they actually accused this guy of being
[1:24:07] a clairvoyant they thought he was like I
[1:24:10] mean if it was 400 years ago he probably
[1:24:12] would have got killed as being a witch
[1:24:13] you know but they accused him of being a
[1:24:16] clairvoyant for somehow knowing the
[1:24:18] future it was that
[1:24:20] the same
[1:24:23] now this is a very interesting part that
[1:24:26] observation they found that the rivets
[1:24:29] were low grade they weren't the proper
[1:24:32] steel ones in a lot of the very
[1:24:34] essential parts of the hull so the hull
[1:24:36] of the ship the very protection of the
[1:24:39] ship the sheet metal was thick enough
[1:24:40] that was of good standard but the rivets
[1:24:43] that held the sheets together was of
[1:24:45] substandard and you can see now all this
[1:24:48] red in the rivets these rivets were
[1:24:50] actually analyzed and they come out of
[1:24:52] the ship that was at the bottom and all
[1:24:54] this red stuff is impurities in the
[1:24:56] rivet and so what happened was when it
[1:24:59] struck the iceberg as these people said
[1:25:01] here the hull was not punctured by the
[1:25:03] iceberg but rather dented such that the
[1:25:06] whole seams buckled and separated
[1:25:08] allowing water to rush in so see the
[1:25:11] devil doesn't just come with sharp stuff
[1:25:14] he just comes with something blunt and
[1:25:16] if your rivets aren't if you're if if
[1:25:18] the protection around you isn't of
[1:25:20] sufficiency then the thing is it's just
[1:25:22] going to Buckle in
[1:25:24] but if you've got Christ in the vessel
[1:25:26] if you've got the the the the the the
[1:25:28] the very Seven Star General navigating
[1:25:31] and he's building the bark of your tree
[1:25:33] the doctrine revealing to you the word
[1:25:36] you're in the word you you you know
[1:25:39] you've got a good foundation in your
[1:25:41] reading children do you hear me children
[1:25:43] are you reading every morning are you
[1:25:46] reading it it doesn't have to be big
[1:25:48] long chapters and you know but just read
[1:25:50] it that's a supernatural book
[1:25:53] you just say Lord I want you to speak to
[1:25:55] me
[1:25:56] let me hear it Lord I want to hear you
[1:25:58] it might be a verse but if he speaks in
[1:26:01] it's worth everything and that's
[1:26:03] building your rivets so that when the
[1:26:05] Devil comes and nudges up against you
[1:26:07] and he will
[1:26:09] he will and God and even if even now let
[1:26:12] me say this is kind of inspiring to me
[1:26:14] that even with the Seven Star General
[1:26:16] he's going to allow a few icebergs for
[1:26:18] you he's going to allow a couple of
[1:26:20] dents but if your rivets aren't good
[1:26:22] and if you're just relying on your own
[1:26:24] without reading without feeding on the
[1:26:28] word without trusting in the Lord and
[1:26:30] you're getting into your own sufficiency
[1:26:32] because it was Pride that they just
[1:26:34] thought well we just can cut corners and
[1:26:37] that's what man does and that's what you
[1:26:39] will end up doing when you're in your
[1:26:40] own sufficiency when you're proud you'll
[1:26:43] have to cut Corners because you don't
[1:26:45] know none of us really really know right
[1:26:48] we don't know we don't have all
[1:26:50] knowledge like that we can't just go and
[1:26:52] look into the future we need him
[1:26:54] comment we need him and every step every
[1:26:58] moment
[1:26:59] we cannot let Pride hold us back
[1:27:11] this part here is one of the biggest
[1:27:13] things that really moves me is the
[1:27:16] Unseen damage you see when they hit that
[1:27:19] Iceberg they didn't realize how bad it
[1:27:21] was and actually
[1:27:24] the interesting thing is it wasn't that
[1:27:26] big there was one square meter of Hull
[1:27:29] when if they added all the gases
[1:27:31] together it was it equated to one square
[1:27:34] meter in a very very big ship
[1:27:38] one square meter of gas left unhealed
[1:27:44] can cause a whole life to sink
[1:27:48] and if you are willing to be proud and
[1:27:51] stay proud and not let God heal that
[1:27:53] thing in your life that's happened
[1:27:57] like they through Pride left it and and
[1:28:01] didn't realize how bad it was they just
[1:28:03] kept going
[1:28:05] they just keep going they didn't they
[1:28:07] they just thought it was okay until
[1:28:09] things started really happening and they
[1:28:11] realized no no this is not okay
[1:28:13] this is really not okay and this is the
[1:28:16] same thing in our own life with our
[1:28:17] human Spirit we can go through life and
[1:28:20] things can happen in an unconscious
[1:28:21] realm things can happen and you might
[1:28:24] have things that are in your life that
[1:28:25] you're dealing with that no one can see
[1:28:27] and you're hiding them and you're
[1:28:29] harboring them and they're and I'm
[1:28:31] trying not to look at people because I
[1:28:32] don't want people to think that I'm
[1:28:33] talking about them I'm not if I look at
[1:28:35] you I'm just your friend okay well I'm
[1:28:37] not meaning you so yeah I feel
[1:28:40] unconnected if I don't look at people
[1:28:42] um but you know sometimes when you're
[1:28:44] saying things and it's like it can be
[1:28:46] quite challenging you think oh man
[1:28:47] they're looking at me and sometimes Ben
[1:28:49] looks at me and he's saying these things
[1:28:50] and I'm like oh he's looking at me
[1:28:52] and I'm always owning everything anyway
[1:28:55] so you know I'm having a I go through a
[1:28:57] roller coaster sometimes oh my I think
[1:29:00] we all do right we should right we
[1:29:03] should be listening to everything and
[1:29:04] analyzing our life and I want to analyze
[1:29:07] my life and not right now the very Pride
[1:29:09] of the Titanic and the people that
[1:29:12] believed in that Spirit of that age they
[1:29:14] trusted that it was nothing yeah they
[1:29:17] should have gone straight to it and they
[1:29:18] should have sent out the stress straight
[1:29:20] away they and they wasted hours
[1:29:23] and in our life we can sit and come to
[1:29:26] church and go to conventions and go to
[1:29:29] camps and go to fellowship and you look
[1:29:32] all good on the top where everyone can
[1:29:33] see but underneath your waterline is
[1:29:36] gashes and water's coming in and your
[1:29:38] ship's getting lower and lower and
[1:29:41] people are watching a slow sinking
[1:29:43] sometimes
[1:29:46] huh
[1:29:47] it can happen
[1:29:51] Lord help us
[1:29:53] and that gesh in our life that no one
[1:29:57] can see but you know it's there
[1:29:59] as bolstered and guarded with pride
[1:30:02] and sometimes we just have to come clean
[1:30:05] yeah it's Pride that actually holds us
[1:30:08] in a vice of grudges
[1:30:11] of of and unforgiveness
[1:30:14] you know most unforgiveness is caused by
[1:30:16] your pride being challenged someone's
[1:30:19] challenge stepped on your pride and now
[1:30:21] you're holding something because that if
[1:30:23] you just just let go of that you will be
[1:30:25] out of there in many cases and forgive
[1:30:28] people truly forgive because you realize
[1:30:31] oh it's just they just they just stepped
[1:30:33] on my toes or they just offended me but
[1:30:36] the more humble you become the more
[1:30:38] buoyant and you to become to offenses
[1:30:42] you know when you're a proud person you
[1:30:44] get offended all the time I just get
[1:30:46] offended and offended and you just have
[1:30:47] this big pride and you're sailing
[1:30:49] through and everyone thinks you're okay
[1:30:51] but you've got gashes and you're sinking
[1:30:54] slowly I watch the two hour There's an
[1:30:57] actual uh
[1:30:58] oh my goodness it was just so moving I I
[1:31:01] watched a two hour real time or four
[1:31:03] hour whatever it is from 11 40 all the
[1:31:05] way through to it going down I watched a
[1:31:08] proper full real-time sinking of the
[1:31:10] Titanic all done and
[1:31:12] um uh graphics and things but very good
[1:31:14] and I was just blown away you just see
[1:31:17] this big thing just slowly and I thought
[1:31:20] my goodness Lord never let me have pride
[1:31:23] in my life
[1:31:24] that I'm going to keep hiding my real
[1:31:27] true self and what I'm really struggling
[1:31:29] with what I'm going through we're here
[1:31:32] this is what we're here for
[1:31:34] and it's the pride that's slowly sinking
[1:31:37] us but yet the Lord is saying I'm here
[1:31:40] where is your ship
[1:31:42] where are you
[1:31:44] how high is your ship
[1:31:46] how high is the water line where are you
[1:31:49] I'm just saying that
[1:31:51] that's a Christian now this was a very
[1:31:54] interesting thing because I read I mean
[1:31:56] I'm skipping so many things that I could
[1:31:58] have put in here because you know we are
[1:32:00] midweek
[1:32:01] oh my
[1:32:03] as the ship sunk more
[1:32:06] the more cavities they were around it
[1:32:08] that weren't meant to be there you see
[1:32:10] now all the stuff starts to crowd around
[1:32:12] and the more lower you go the faster
[1:32:14] you're thinking
[1:32:15] and so where is your ship
[1:32:17] where are you at where is your life the
[1:32:20] Titanic is representing your life it's
[1:32:22] representing you
[1:32:24] but sometimes some of us have to come to
[1:32:26] a point you know some of us hear the
[1:32:28] warnings and we change and we humble
[1:32:30] ourselves some of us we feel the gash
[1:32:33] and we get scraped by an iceberg and we
[1:32:35] humble ourselves
[1:32:36] some of us are just so proud that we
[1:32:38] don't even we don't need that we just
[1:32:40] keep going and we keep holding ourselves
[1:32:42] up and looking real good
[1:32:44] but really Insight is is pain insiders
[1:32:47] is these troubles that are that are that
[1:32:49] are so deep in fact we can hide them
[1:32:52] we're hiding them and the law and the
[1:32:54] Lord is trying to to call us off that
[1:32:57] thing but he's saying how far does your
[1:32:59] ship need to sink before you're going to
[1:33:00] humble yourself and and get and get get
[1:33:03] help from him
[1:33:05] because as it goes down the sinking rate
[1:33:07] increases flowing into windows and vents
[1:33:11] and so it becomes worse and faster and
[1:33:13] faster but how far will you go some of
[1:33:15] us get to this stage
[1:33:17] before we call for help
[1:33:19] because it gets to a point now you can't
[1:33:21] hide it
[1:33:23] gets to a point now and some of us the
[1:33:25] ship's gone right down I don't know if
[1:33:27] I've got any pictures no
[1:33:29] some of us it gets right down and
[1:33:30] further and further until it's half
[1:33:32] under the water and the things sink
[1:33:34] sticking up in the air like I showed you
[1:33:36] before those pictures and the whole
[1:33:38] thing breaks and your life is broken
[1:33:40] and everything's gone and your family's
[1:33:42] scattered and it's all just broken
[1:33:44] for what reason Pride
[1:33:46] you weren't willing to get help
[1:33:49] or let go of that thing or truly open up
[1:33:52] you know sometimes it's just because we
[1:33:54] our father was horrible to us or or
[1:33:56] neglected us and so you have this thing
[1:33:58] that God and you don't realize it but
[1:34:00] God you in your subconscious thinks
[1:34:03] God's like that but he's not like that
[1:34:04] and you have to just scream and cry out
[1:34:07] to God with all your heart it doesn't
[1:34:09] have to be loud but just really mean it
[1:34:11] like Hannah in the temple when she
[1:34:13] finally came to a point where she said
[1:34:14] Lord
[1:34:15] huh I need life
[1:34:20] some of us our life has been completely
[1:34:23] obliterated before we've really truly
[1:34:26] repented and given God everything and
[1:34:28] surrendered and got help
[1:34:30] and the ship's gone down you know what
[1:34:33] happened when the ship went down and you
[1:34:34] can imagine these people are floating in
[1:34:37] the sea and this and the ship goes down
[1:34:39] some of them got sucked in by the
[1:34:41] current that pulled him down but the
[1:34:43] people that you can imagine maybe a
[1:34:45] thousand people just floating around in
[1:34:47] the sea and they this this giant ship
[1:34:49] goes down
[1:34:51] and then all of a sudden a couple of
[1:34:52] minutes later you hear this
[1:34:56] and that ship smashed on the floor of
[1:34:58] the sea 3.8 kilometers down and at that
[1:35:02] some people's lives have to get to that
[1:35:04] stage where you're floating in the
[1:35:06] Atlantic
[1:35:07] freezing cold but let me tell you
[1:35:10] there's still hope
[1:35:11] because our God walks on water
[1:35:14] and he comes walking on the water even
[1:35:16] in the stormy seas of your life to say
[1:35:18] come up hither and if you are willing to
[1:35:20] surrender your pride and humble yourself
[1:35:22] totally and say Lord save me like Peter
[1:35:24] did and Jesus came walking up and he
[1:35:26] pulled him back so he could walk on the
[1:35:28] water and give him a new life did he
[1:35:31] give Peter a new life see Jesus wants to
[1:35:33] give you a new life he wants to bind up
[1:35:36] the bridge of your Hull can we have the
[1:35:38] musicians please
[1:35:41] as the musicians come I'm just going to
[1:35:42] work through these things here
[1:35:43] serenading our sinking ship you see the
[1:35:45] musicians came on the ship to make it an
[1:35:48] easier sinking
[1:35:49] but you see in our life I don't believe
[1:35:51] that we should just serenade our
[1:35:54] problems with convention worship and
[1:35:57] having a great time I mean we should
[1:35:58] have a great time but if you're just
[1:36:00] going to go to convince have a great
[1:36:01] time and not get healed and not get
[1:36:03] delivered because you're too proud too
[1:36:04] arrogant to admit that you're wrong and
[1:36:06] you've got these things in your life
[1:36:07] that need healing
[1:36:10] what's the point of serenading yourself
[1:36:12] David had to serenade Saul Saul serenade
[1:36:15] he didn't change him
[1:36:16] how many years was Saul preserved in his
[1:36:20] mental condition his inferiority
[1:36:22] complexes because of music that was
[1:36:24] serenading him and making him feel good
[1:36:26] but don't be guilty of letting God do
[1:36:29] that letting the church do that to you
[1:36:32] no I'm not I'm all for music I love it
[1:36:35] as you know I love worship
[1:36:37] I love it I think we should but that
[1:36:41] shouldn't be the thing that stops you
[1:36:42] from getting healed because you come
[1:36:44] into a meeting and you come when you
[1:36:46] know you've got this trouble you know
[1:36:47] you need healing and then all of a
[1:36:49] sudden you feel good again
[1:36:51] because the music's there though the
[1:36:52] atmosphere is there and then you don't
[1:36:54] do that thing that you're meant to do
[1:36:55] you just had to go and and get serenaded
[1:36:58] and these guys were serenading the
[1:37:00] singing of the ship now I give it my
[1:37:02] hand up to them in that natural
[1:37:03] condition but your ship doesn't have to
[1:37:05] go down bear went down because they
[1:37:07] refused to go to God
[1:37:09] they refused to come and humble
[1:37:11] themselves and cry out actually there
[1:37:12] was a preacher there and he was saving
[1:37:14] Souls right to the end swimming through
[1:37:16] the ocean saving Souls I thought
[1:37:19] Hallelujah I'm gonna meet him one day a
[1:37:22] real man of God he was saving Souls all
[1:37:25] the way through to the end and then he
[1:37:27] froze in the ocean and went down a hero
[1:37:29] and I'd say that he was the greatest
[1:37:31] hero of that ship Hallelujah those other
[1:37:34] people saved Sinners out of the water
[1:37:36] and they stayed in sin but this man made
[1:37:39] people go to heaven gave them eternal
[1:37:41] life was handed through to them and I
[1:37:44] believe that when you are willing to
[1:37:46] truly humble yourself and let God heal
[1:37:49] you no matter what's going on in your
[1:37:50] life
[1:37:51] when you're under the squeeze
[1:37:53] what's going to come out
[1:37:55] and I would I would think that about
[1:37:57] this story too if you were on that ship
[1:38:00] what would have you done would you have
[1:38:02] been a coward
[1:38:04] or would you have been a hero
[1:38:09] I was going to share a testimony
[1:38:11] but I think I won't but well there was
[1:38:13] one time I want to share just one
[1:38:14] testimony can you guys just play I had a
[1:38:17] song there
[1:38:18] um the when the road you walk leads you
[1:38:20] tired and warm oh uh The Battle Belongs
[1:38:22] to the Lord or the battle is the Lord's
[1:38:24] yeah the battle is the Lord
[1:38:27] I it was about well a few years ago now
[1:38:31] I
[1:38:33] I started getting real proud
[1:38:35] I didn't really realize it and sometimes
[1:38:38] you don't realize that you're proud
[1:38:40] but if you're stagnant
[1:38:42] and you're not growing
[1:38:44] it's probably Pride or if you're able to
[1:38:46] not if you're not able to forgive
[1:38:48] someone
[1:38:49] that's Pride it's proud that there's a
[1:38:51] pride going and you don't realize it but
[1:38:53] if you've got In God's Presence not just
[1:38:55] to serenade you to make you feel better
[1:38:56] but to actually really get in God's
[1:38:58] presence in your prayer Closet in your
[1:39:00] own time with the Lord you get serious
[1:39:02] with God you've got to come into a place
[1:39:04] with the Lord where his light shines in
[1:39:06] your life and discerns your heart so
[1:39:07] that you can know what's going on with
[1:39:09] you you know I'm sure we've all prayed
[1:39:11] this Lord show me where I'm at where am
[1:39:14] I at Lord what's going on in my life
[1:39:17] and you take inventory who takes stock
[1:39:19] do you want to take stock here you've
[1:39:22] got to take stock children take stock
[1:39:25] don't just float around you'll end up
[1:39:27] like that
[1:39:28] because all the icebergs around cut you
[1:39:30] up
[1:39:31] thank God when you take stock and he
[1:39:34] begins to come down he came down in my
[1:39:35] life and I was I remember praying I
[1:39:37] thought Lord I'm just feeling a bit
[1:39:39] stagnant I don't know why just feeling a
[1:39:42] bit stale and so I got down and prayed
[1:39:44] and you know from time to time when I
[1:39:46] pray the Lord really comes down you know
[1:39:49] and so I felt like the spirit of God was
[1:39:51] coming down
[1:39:52] and then he stopped
[1:39:54] and he was just above me and I thought
[1:39:56] man why is he not coming right down you
[1:39:58] know what's happening and then as he was
[1:40:00] hovering above
[1:40:01] all the he revealed the pride and
[1:40:04] arrogance that was in my life and it
[1:40:06] just dawned on me the memories and all
[1:40:08] it just went it just was like in a Split
[1:40:09] Second
[1:40:12] and I said oh God forgive me I'm sorry
[1:40:15] and that was all it took forgive me for
[1:40:17] being proud
[1:40:19] and all of a sudden that presence that
[1:40:21] stopped went just came right down
[1:40:23] and I was back in Fellowship and maybe
[1:40:25] you're feeling stagnant or you haven't
[1:40:27] had an experience like that
[1:40:28] just ask the Lord what's going on in my
[1:40:31] life Lord
[1:40:32] amen
[1:40:34] Hallelujah
[1:40:36] I've already touched on this but I want
[1:40:39] to read this
[1:40:40] oh this great and sinful Nation that's
[1:40:42] the very violin that was played as they
[1:40:45] were sinking down
[1:40:47] that was serenading them but the music
[1:40:49] changed watch this oh this great sinful
[1:40:51] Nations sometimes your rock and rolls
[1:40:53] are going to stop
[1:40:55] if you won't listen to the voice of a
[1:40:57] Preacher
[1:40:58] you'll listen to the hand of or you'll
[1:41:01] listen to the hand of God and judgment
[1:41:02] someday
[1:41:04] did you get that if you're not going to
[1:41:06] listen to a preacher
[1:41:09] you'll listen to the hand of God and
[1:41:11] judgment someday
[1:41:13] but the rock and roll will stop
[1:41:15] that thing those spirits that are taking
[1:41:17] you into Armageddon those spirits that
[1:41:20] are influencing you and you're getting
[1:41:21] into it behind your parents back and
[1:41:23] things that you're doing without them
[1:41:24] knowing
[1:41:25] it's going to take you to judgment
[1:41:28] which says here the rock and roll they
[1:41:30] were playing jazz on that thing and they
[1:41:32] were playing all this nice music and
[1:41:34] just kind of and all of a sudden it got
[1:41:36] real serious and they played started
[1:41:38] playing Nearer My God to thee because
[1:41:40] the Music's Got to change but how many
[1:41:42] how long is it going to take what is it
[1:41:44] gonna take for your music to change now
[1:41:47] I'm not speaking about music here
[1:41:48] because I like that well the music is
[1:41:50] your life the song what are you singing
[1:41:52] what's coming out what's the the melody
[1:41:55] is it harmonious with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:00] what will it take to change the music of
[1:42:02] your life
[1:42:03] will it take the ship to the water to
[1:42:05] come up to you will you be floating in
[1:42:06] the sea you need a rescue out by the
[1:42:08] ward Lord that walks on water or will
[1:42:10] you take the head before the iceberg
[1:42:12] comes will you take and heed the
[1:42:14] warnings
[1:42:16] someday you are going to change that
[1:42:18] tune the prophet says the music stopped
[1:42:21] here
[1:42:22] they they they rejected the message of
[1:42:25] Daniel
[1:42:26] and they got proud and they were they
[1:42:28] were drunk little vessels irreverently
[1:42:30] out of Jehovah's Temple the vein talks
[1:42:33] stopped here at the Tower of Babel
[1:42:35] because this cup of iniquity was getting
[1:42:37] full
[1:42:39] you've got to know when you looked
[1:42:41] you've got to know when you're licked
[1:42:43] and you need help and it's time to
[1:42:45] humble yourself
[1:42:48] where will what will it take for your
[1:42:51] pride to break
[1:42:53] where's your ship head how far does your
[1:42:55] ship need to go before you will make
[1:42:56] that change because I can guarantee you
[1:43:00] your ship is going to do that without
[1:43:02] God
[1:43:04] that's where every ship is heading every
[1:43:06] life and I'm not talking about physical
[1:43:08] life now I'm talking about the life
[1:43:10] around you your influence your life your
[1:43:12] school your future everything that you
[1:43:15] are as a person in your name and your
[1:43:17] reputation that
[1:43:19] the life that you live
[1:43:21] without Christ when you're
[1:43:23] self-sufficient or you're relying on
[1:43:25] some other Spirit which is either God or
[1:43:27] Satan there's only two
[1:43:30] it's going to go like that if you're not
[1:43:31] relying on the Lord
[1:43:34] it's going to go that way
[1:43:35] but where is it now
[1:43:38] where's your ship
[1:43:40] where is it
[1:43:41] where is your ship you should know where
[1:43:44] your ship is
[1:43:45] have you let that gas go on too long
[1:43:47] have you let that thing go on too long
[1:43:48] it's never too long it's never too late
[1:43:51] there's a God here right now to heal you
[1:43:54] if you're willing
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:56] no matter how cold how hopeless how
[1:43:59] confused how dark how proud you've been
[1:44:01] until now
[1:44:03] I'm ready to humble myself
[1:44:05] laying down every reason every mess
[1:44:08] every past hurt
[1:44:10] before my ship lays in the bottom of the
[1:44:12] Atlantic
[1:44:14] there's a bit there's someone here
[1:44:16] that's walking on the water tonight he
[1:44:18] wants to bring you out but otherwise
[1:44:20] you'd be like that man now Peter
[1:44:22] he looked around and he started sinking
[1:44:24] but you see now he cried out
[1:44:26] before I end up in the Frozen grave of
[1:44:29] Pride and separation
[1:44:31] maybe you're there
[1:44:33] we've all been in these situations
[1:44:34] doesn't I don't know how far but some of
[1:44:37] us have been pretty far we've been
[1:44:39] pretty low but though I make my bed and
[1:44:41] Hell behold Thou Art there
[1:44:43] no matter where you're at tonight
[1:44:45] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:44:47] light there's a man here he's our hero
[1:44:49] he's our real he's the true man his name
[1:44:52] is Jesus Christ and he's here to turn on
[1:44:54] the light he's here to heal you he's
[1:44:57] here if you're willing to Just Surrender
[1:44:58] that Pride to surrender self-sufficiency
[1:45:01] now to lay it all down no matter how far
[1:45:04] no matter how whatever Ladle down
[1:45:08] you know one of the biggest things that
[1:45:09] held me back when I was first giving my
[1:45:11] life to the Lord I didn't want to
[1:45:13] surrender my identity
[1:45:14] I thought I was this uh someone I think
[1:45:17] rather been preacher on Sunday he said
[1:45:19] what you thought you were
[1:45:21] not what you were
[1:45:23] we weren't that ever
[1:45:25] that's what we thought we were because
[1:45:26] the devil influenced us
[1:45:28] but then God gave you another thought a
[1:45:30] higher thought he revealed to you who
[1:45:32] you really are that's who you are and
[1:45:34] who you always will be and who and and
[1:45:36] now just catch this now who you always
[1:45:39] were and are
[1:45:40] because you're an eternal being you come
[1:45:42] from God and you're going back
[1:45:44] before I end up in the Frozen grave of
[1:45:46] Pride and separation
[1:45:47] Lord save me out of this mess
[1:45:50] where are you at
[1:45:52] that's my last question to you
[1:45:55] will your pride win
[1:45:58] or will you lay it down let's stand
[1:46:02] will your pride win because if your
[1:46:03] pride wins you stay where you are and
[1:46:05] you sink if you humble yourself and let
[1:46:09] God come in and be your sufficiency be
[1:46:11] your all in all
[1:46:13] your ship will be healed the bricks will
[1:46:16] be wherever you're at he will bring your
[1:46:19] ship out of the Atlantic if it's sinking
[1:46:20] down
[1:46:21] if it's all broken apart screaming and
[1:46:23] all your family's gone
[1:46:25] he will bring it back do you believe it
[1:46:28] children do you believe it no matter
