precious time in your presence tonight believe in Jesus Christ's name Lord we want to ask these things amen amen god bless you thank you musicians amen trusty ones well tonight if you've got your Bibles handy let's turn to seeking Corinthians chapter 10 see convenes 10 and we are continuing on our thought of a letter C in church age but I want to kind of it's a zoom into one particular thing here so seeking synchron's 10 and 3 verses 3 and 5 it says here for though we walk in the flesh so second Corinthians 10 and verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ amen may the Lord bless us would you may have your seats this evening and I want to you know we we went through Sunday about revelations 9 and the bottomless pit opening and Hell coming upon the earth but then also the mighty angel the Lord Jesus coming down to anoint has you know has in time people but we see there we're not going to read it but you know we read there in Revelations 9 that that there's a you know that you know that demon power that came out upon the earth was to torment those who had not the seal of God on their forehead so I could say just from that as a bit of a context that the battle and the mind is far greater and this age then that ever has been but and so it's very so what I want to talk about tonight is not you know not necessarily salvation but it's but it's amazing where where the battle and the mind can either enable the promise of God to you or actually disable it based on what's going on in your spirit realm and at sea you know your Paul is instructing the Corinthians to take captive bringing every and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ these commanding you've got to take your thoughts captive you've got to arrest them you're going to take them prisoner you can't just let it wander you've got to lay captive upon them bring them obedient he's not talking about here you know we you know we can preach on the soul and the soul is redeemed and you know we're sealed unto the day of our Redemption but at what happens in our mind can really determine how successful our walk will be you know we know that you know as we read on Sunday that they overcame him by the blood of lamb in the word of their testimony so you know the conclusion is done you know we read in the book of Revelation that the devil and the false prophet and all the beasts and all those things they thrown into the lake of fire and the believers are singing hallelujah glory to the lamb and you know and then it's a new heaven and new earth and eternity rolls on that's the foregone conclusion but between here and there a lot of things can happen and so Paul's instructing them to lay hold to to bring every thought into captivity and this is what we're instructed to do because the mind here is a very powerful place and many times we know the devil could inspire your thinking God can inspire your thinking or it can just be you yourself bouncing around in your mind but it's depending what how you you know what you think you know what you ponder on you think upon your ways and and your thoughts will lead you in a certain direction you just take anything in life you like you know you know if you're gone by okay begin to think well I need to buy a new car and your thoughts will take you in that direction and you have these certain things you want to you know the reason you buy a certain car because your thoughts have taken you in that direction so now about spiritually we must be careful what how we entertain our thoughts amen because it says in Isaiah 26 and three they will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me because he trusts us in thee now if that promise was under the blood of bulls and goats how much more those have been washed in the blood of the Lamb they've been reconciled to God by his blood I mean so he's told that he will will be kept in perfect peace of our mind has stayed on him so you can take the opposite we will be kept and chaos and in disarray and being upset and troubled if our mind has not stayed on him now we understand that that our thinking what we think about affects our body I mean you think about a very stressful time in your life you can have a flashback or you think about something that's very traumatic to you you'll find your heart racing you'll find your pulse you know going in your blood pressure rise and different things because you're reliving that moment and as I say so our our bodies are affected by what we think about amen so you know Jesus said it well let's just go down to scripture where it says in the book of Proverbs 17 and 22 it says a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit dries the bones so saying if you're merry if you're happy if you think about good things it's like a medicine to your body but if you have a broken spirit it's going to dry the bones it's going to be detrimental to your health to your physical well-being so you got to think about what you know you got to you got to guard now what's going on in this space we're to think about it now Jesus season I'm just going to really go through some scriptures and go into a few courts but Jesus is in Luke chapter 12 verses 28 and 29 you know we should be you know this age is full of pressure tension you know people's tie your peoples days aren't aren't you know down to hours but they're down to minutes you know everything's just so I got this much time to this this much time this it's a very nervous pressure pressured age you know that the devil has constructed and it can distract us so much and but we shouldn't be caught up in those things Luke 12 and 28 29 I think God so clothes the grass which is today in the field and tomorrow's cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you O ye ye of little faith and seek he not what you shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind now this word doubtful mind I won't try and pronounce the Greek word but it's a verb this word mind and it's a and it's a the definition is to race like in midair ie figuratively to suspend to fluctuate or to be anxious so something that moves up and down the track it's not state if your mind has stayed on him it stays rivers of a duck if it's moving up and down with the tide or you know whatever may be affecting it your mind will be moving you'll be tossed to and fro we're not meant to have tossed to and fro minds they meant we have to keep our minds focused on time we're gonna take every thought captive we're instructed to take every thought captive amen so so if we're instructed to do so we have the power to do it we have the power to do it God doesn't tell us to do something without first giving the ability I mean so so if we're told take every thought into captivity then we can do it amen so if our mind is not stayed on him we will not have perfect peace if our mind is stayed on our neighbor our brother our sister our minds will be tossed a mint what are we thinking about what are we thinking about we're going to keep our mind stayed on him I pray the Lord does and I'm putting myself on the operating table do some surgery amen he said now we understand when Jesus was here he was speaking to a religious world that was of purely of the outward appearance it was you know they had to dress a certain way they you know they they found fault in his disciples hadn't washed their hands before they ate and you know they had all this ceremony and as all outward things but when Jesus was the very one who gave the law became flesh and was talking to them he didn't speak about the outward he said in in Matthew 15 verse 16 it says and Jesus said are you also yet without understanding do you not understand that whatsoever entereth in it the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the draught but those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witnesses blasphemies these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man so he's saying it's not the things that come in physically it's what comes out of the heart will defile you look at the scribes and Pharisees outwardly they you know they looked very holy but inwardly they were a bunch of dead man's bones you know they called Jesus that you know Beelzebub they you know they you know made false accusation against because it was coming out of their heart what was really in them and it's out of our member as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so we can be perfectly dressed just right we can act just right but in word we can be bitter and twisted and angry and resentful and those things will come out so it has to be more than outward adoring you know of the message the message has to be in you right because we can be bitter and angry against certain people certain things and out of your heart that will speak Amen is what God's got to get in there do some surgery right because it's not it's out of the things that come out of the heart they defile so if you begin to speak negative things they will defile you right you can only live as high as you think so if you thinking if you think you're Unforgiven and you're a sinner and you're vile and you're Richard and you'll never make it that's what your life will be if you think that way but if you think what God says about you I've been redeemed jesus paid it all I've been washed white as snow his blood is enough I mean I'm his child he's in this message together you me to himself ever been swept up in this and this last move of God - that God would gather a bride are you beginning to think about those things you'll live according to that I mean I am as righteous as he is righteous Paul said he became me that I might become the very righteous of God through Christ we believe the first but yes he became sin for me believe the second part of that scripture that I'd become the very righteous of God through Christ right so if you think about it that way then your life will be different but if you think negatively about what God has done for you you you won't get anywhere with him humanity dwells on the negative to much I meant this world was full of negative we shouldn't be we have great exceeding precious promises we should be arraying those around us keeping them around us can you look at the promise not the circumstance who cares about the circumstance I'm in this world as this world is going straight to hell I'm not looking at this world i I received the promise I'm going to embrace the promise only keep focused on the promise thought on my house shall be safe I'll keep that promise I mean I awoke in the light as he is in the light I'll keep that promise amen he is my comforter I'm going to keep that promise amen he he's my defense he's my mighty target running toward him safe he's my shield he's my buckler he's my Healy's my protector I'm going to keep those promises around me who cares about what the world is going oh I don't care that's not my promise that's not my covenant God didn't make it that kind of covenant with me he said I'm going to take you I'm gonna wash you make you a new creature transform you by my word make you into my image change your body hallelujah make you walk on streets of gold Amen that's that's what I'm gonna keep around me what are you looking at what you look at you will become you see people you see young people they see you know this world is so aggressive they put with their advertising in social media and they put it down your throats you must become this way and people who look at those things they become it I mean you know Lady Gaga I wish I kept the you know the end of you a few years agos in the New Zealand Herald she prayed make me crazy I don't know what she was praying to but it wasn't God and she had posters of all famous artists on her walls and she was said she wanted to become like them she got her desire her prayer was answered what are you looking at because what you look at is what you will become amen the judgment that you meet out will be you will receive I'm just going to flip it around every way so if you are judging others saying look at them they're this way they're this way that Jasmine will come upon you amen love covers a multitude of sin it covers a multitude a multitude a lot not just a few a multitude assert whatever happened to giving people the benefit of the doubt and looking through God's eyes if God changed you you say well they're still down at the bottom of the ladder and I'm way up here don't try and kick someone down when they're trying to you gods during them take come up further the winners way better up here you understand what I'm saying people stop making baby steps and you say well why are they you know imagine you parents here you see your child begin to crawl and just maybe rocks back and forth girls backwards you don't you don't yeah you don't deal with them because they can't crawl you never punish your child because they can't crawl yet you say oh well that's obvious you're gonna bring it into the spiritual some children take a lot longer to walk but eventually every child walks right some children takes a long time than to start talking but every child begins to speak you've got to let them tire give them time to speak they will they will start speaking eventually they meant they may say googoo gaga but eventually words will begin to be formed I mean just like in the spiritual where God where people were going to speak God's language speak the language of this word I mean I'm more than an overcomer hallelujah are more than victorious amen through him that's what out of a so that's what's now it says in Hebrews chapter 12 I want to live a I want to go to I want to go to heaven victorious you know here brother Ron Spencer it is about how you know it should be when your eyes open in the morning this should be alarm bells going through hell he's up or she's up what's going to happen today they should be in battle stations in their bunkers you know not to attack but to defend what's this child of God going to do I don't know all things are possible go with them but just just try not to tell the mat you know the devil should be terrified when you roll out of bed in the morning maybe your back is half dislocated and you've got to take a while to get the feeling in your limbs but the Satan himself should be trembling I mean when the bride wakes up and every morning it should be thank you Jesus for another day I have life in this body to praise you I won't lead a rock in my place I mean I learned that some birds sing in my place I'm going to praise the Lord with my life hallelujah that's how it should be I have another day I have another 24 hours to praise God I'm in and in whatever capacity with my children with my aunt worker yeah my very life should be a worship I mean you don't have to tell the birds to wake up and start singing when the Sun comes up they just start singing only because the Sun comes up I mean they begin to worship God hallelujah that's another day nature worships God amen it should be the same thing with us the Sun's up children we're not in darkness anymore Alleluia hey Hebrews 12 and 12 wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make paths straight for your feet least that which is lame be turned out of the way but they don't rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without no man shall see the Lord now notice what we just read follow peace with all men okay and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently least any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and whereby many be defiled he's instructing you must follow do you see how those two statements are linked follow peace with all men this is the thing you must do and holiness with without which no man shall see the Lord so you've got to follow peace with all men least I'm just telling me the second part of verse 15 because I want to look these two things together lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you if you don't follow peace with all me and there's going to be a root of bitterness spring up this that's the conclusion I'm trying to draw out of this because if you are if you're against someone and you hold a grudge and you're bitter against them and resentful it doesn't affect them at affects you you're not following peace with them right you're actually declaring war on them and it's what comes out of your heart is just going to defile you they may never know we'll realize what's going on but and you can be a route of business growing and instead of being loving the Lord happy at peace rejoicing you become bitter bitterness isn't sweet amen it's not a you know if you see someone's face when they bite into a lemon they're not used to bitterness is it yo and you see someone I'm in the message hallelujah where's the joy that died along is shriveled up a long time ago do not end up that way don't even take a step that way amen because ultimately the devil's got it in here and that's and that thing becomes all they think about amen and there to fix your health that affects your family that affects everyone around you now season flip Ian's for eight for six to eight be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving that your Kris be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus so don't stress about it be careful for nothing you know committed to the Lord just walk with Him don't get stressed don't get worried about it brother Brown preacher swim and letting off the pressure and he says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into enter safe there's a place we can get in and let off the pressure amen and it's not these four walls it's in Christ who's who's gotten into the tower who's been sealed into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost amen so when you get in that place there you can laid off the pressure hallelujah I'm in that place all the time I dwell in that place continually I can let off the pressure you got to look at where you live you mean well I live here I lived another spiritually where are you living I mean you know in the wilderness somewhere you know in some D's it I pray but you're in you're in the City of Refuge which is Jesus Christ and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true now he's giving instruction whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things he's not saying whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are terrible what other things are scandalous what are things that just gossip he doesn't say think on those things think on these things it's a lot of things to think about he's instructing this how you take your your mind captive your thoughts captive I mean you keep your mind state on these things now this is not mind over matter this is word over matter I mean you're going to bring your circumstance subject to the Word of God right because if you just look at and when what's going on just naturally I mean then you'll get stressed then you'll get worried then you'll be anxious and you know but then if you bring your thoughts subject to the Word of God I mean that's what we need to do the devil loves to come and take our minds in a million places sometimes we just take it in a million places but you're going to take it captive think on those things worry will get you nowhere faith may deliver you I believe ultimately it will look at the Hebrew children going into the fiery furnace if we perish through perish if we don't hallelujah but we're not going to bow down they didn't they didn't get worried about it that that that was all they head we can't do this we can't bow down to your image Oh King live forever if our God delivers us praise the Lord have thought well we'll burn their minds what state he followed me they weren't all worried about they just they just winnin they were resigned they made up their minds you gotta make up your mind you gotta make up your mind this word is true it is Jesus Christ he is present his word doesn't change doesn't matter what all the atheists and religious realms may say his word is true right his word is sure it hasn't changed it's as good as the day it was written amen is still good today hallelujah we don't need to worry time is nothing with God you say well it was 2000 years ago Paul was writing these letters it doesn't matter it's still good today and it still works now let's read it I was going to read a few things now we must only think positive we can't think negative okay I'm gonna show you negative thoughts will disable your faith okay negative thoughts will disable your faith that's why ignore doubt doubt your doubts because all doubt is is the devil's the devil is speaking from his experience you know people who know nothing about something they always talk negative about it especially when it comes to things of the Lord they they've never tasted and seen that the Lord is good so the normally hundreds in the time war for my experience the people who have never met them they only speak negative because that's their experience they've never experienced it but once you really meet them it's all positive hallelujah amen so that now this is person that suffers from a greater than Solomon is here in 1958 person in here to have this in your mind that as soon as prep I'm sorry well Amir and while I'm praying and speaking I want every person in here to have this on your minds not just the people in the prayer line but everyone he's instructing the whole congregation that as soon as prayer begins to go for the sick every one of you is going to get up and walk out of the building well don't have nothing else in your mind keep thinking that if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him it's from the book of Hebrews there's like people they get healed he says yeah it's a brother Brahim says he says someone comes got cancer they get prayed for the spirit goes out of the cancer and then they begin to feel worse because the body has to purify out the tumor and in the person says I felt wonderful in the prayer line but then three days later of course because that thing begins to decompose and the body's got purified out that's how I feel worse or maybe I wasn't healed and then that unbelief that negative thought just brings brings that spirit back into the cancer again amen ECS basis you feeling worse is the very son you were healed see it's very easy when we're shouting and rejoicing and God is here right and we're having a Jubilee you feel like the dead in Christ are just going to turn up amen that's what it feels like but then it's when we leave that anoint we leave that presence he's always with us but it's different you know what I mean people have a rejoicing camp time they feel like they have basically fly away and then they've got to go back into the real world I mean but they forget and but then they're thinking matches where they are instead of keeping their thinking to how they were thinking in the service amen your are we all following me you got to keep your confession positive doesn't matter if it never comes out of here and here okay no he says you cannot get I was going to repeat that line you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought now that's why we've got to think we've got to think about him you know he's taking us to heaven I mean the church isn't taking us to heaven the Christian world not take against heaven he's taking us to heaven when we come together we worship Him we don't worship the person standing here or the musician or the first next to us we're here to worship God amen and when you think upon him he always draws near when you think about him and you talk about him he always draws near and we see this in Luke 24 it's the resurrections happened the tour walking on the way to Emmaus and they're talking about what God had done in their day they were talking about the living Jesus Christ they didn't understand why everything that was going on but they're talking about what had happened right there and as they will walk in talking about him he himself that they were talking about drew near and walked with them and he began to talk to them he wasn't just an unseen guest in the conversation he began to speak they weren't talking about what Moses did they weren't talking about what happened you know an Eden or some place they were talking about their day because he's the prison god and as they were talking about him he himself Junia and began to speak with them he wants that kind of fellowship because ultimately that's what we want to fellowship with I mean that's why we come together to have fellowship that he himself would step down I meant like brother berry stars from brother head bisko's testimonies up in northern British Columbia you know if brother Branham he's a bud south works place and they're sharing testimony they see the atmosphere just just around the dining table the atmosphere so electric brother Graham said that pillar far is not a few inches from either of us right there because I talking about that God I mean he's the same God we've had experiences it feels like we're just gonna disappear lying in bed talking about him he comes down hallelujah that's what we want and that's what we have talked about the believer our God would never come down and speak yes you got to get that out of your mind our God would never come down member he wants to draw near to you he wants to draw near to you more than you want to draw near to him amen that's what he wants oh but you know that's not a fantasy that's a reality hallelujah now this isn't Mary's belief in 1959 brother Graham says I think that one of the great troubles of the people of this day we have too many other things on our mind even when we come to a healing service we seem to think well I did not get a prayer card tonight or perhaps I'll not be prayed for see notice how close you say we talk about negative thoughts it's not thoughts God's not real he doesn't heal he's not here it's not those kind of thoughts comes right down close look at these thoughts these people are in a healing surface he's talking about and they say well I well I did not get a prayer card tonight over perhaps I won't be prayed for we will never be able to accomplish much accomplish much as long as we keep on those kind of thoughts simple thoughts like that with this person's doing this this child's acting up here this is going on here they're singing this and the wrong key this is too fast this is too slow this is too loud the system quiet that person will that last week you know this chairs not comfortable this chairs too comfortable this chair you know that's too hot it's too cold it's what it's too long it's too short when you have one accomplish anything with those kind of thoughts that's the devil telling you a whole bunch of stuff you don't need to know just like all of basically had virtually 100% of what's on the internet you don't need to know you need to know the message is here the Bible's here testimonies are on here vas other stuff who really cares about it but the devil come and fill your head while you're you know while you're sitting there thinking about tomorrow thinking about next week thinking about I've got to do this I've got to do this when I get home this needs to happen and all that I sort the saddest thing is the oven salon that I do this that I turn this that I lock this that I you know what about my car and editor and editor you won't accomplish much with those kind of thoughts you know take that captive say Lord I'm here and one of one heart my heart is to worship you I want to serve you I don't express my love back to you how great is our God sing with me how great how great is our God he's altogether lovely he's altogether wonderful he's altogether glorious hallelujah that's why we gather to worship so don't worry about all those kind of things now in the service what is the Holy Ghost oh whoa no I just want to read this a bit brother brand this is in 1959 and this happens a few times in his life where he he makes a renewed consecration to God I just want to read this he says the other night at around a little after midnight the wife and I after sitting a sitting up and praying and talking on the Lord across the little footstool in our front room now front room is a lounge and in in the Queen's English or whatever we talk I don't know but front rooms are lounge okay with to open Bibles we consecrated ourselves anew to God for a complete service now here's a here's a prophet you'd say well you'd say how how can he do any more of a complete service well you say he's done a complete service though it comes times in life where this is 1959 there's gonna be 1960 the church ages then shortly after that 1960 200 962 services it's the time of the end in the seals open he's coming to a very important junction and his walk as we are as we you say we have this church I mean this world will never continue on forever amen we've got a plan long term but we're going to live like it maybe tomorrow and it looks like it might be tomorrow oh yeah right so so we're gonna but we have to play long-term right that's why we love the young people and to me I'm one of them I'm gonna try and be part of club as long until I get kicked out you too I'll get out of here anyway you know I don't see age myself I feel young hallelujah anyway but you know so anyway oh I'll just read this we consecrated ourselves anew to God for a complete service that we would surrender our own wills and everything and every negative thought and to serve the Lord Jesus and I trust that's been your attitude to that you've done the same thing then when we are coming tonight we are coming upon holy grounds among the people who's been praying and fasting and making restitutions and getting ready to receive something from God and I know that he that will come hungry will not go away hungry but God will feed him with the bread of life go it's not going to make sure this is so he had a time of consecration notice he had it at home with his wife and as you know in their lounge and the purpose of it was to surrender their wills you'd say well hasn't he done that already he has done that already right and everything for a complete service and every negative thought he come to give over every negative thought amen their own wills for a complete service this is what he did and he did it with us help meet you know what help me it is in the Bible it's not a slave or a servant at someone this is my words but help me is a help that is able to you know someone who is able to do the job right so they are qualified to do the job they're called to do I don't write dictionaries but that's basically what it's not a servant who's sick in class to the one who's called right like Eve wasn't sick in class to Adam they meant she wasn't a servant they were joint ears than the garden before the fall that was his help me he was on equal terms with him a mint and then Peter has to instruct the you know instruct the New Testament they says you know husband's dwell with your wives according to knowledge that your prayers may not be hindered being joined ears of eternal life he his thinking had to be changed because in the Jewish way the woman was seeing close to the men but in the New Testament order the woman are not second-class but their joint is in Christ with the man his thinking had to be changed their thinking had to be changed right and a lot of us has to be you know our culture and what we think has to be changed our minds have to be renewed well I thought it was this and I thought was this God changed my mind you know I'm not interested in my opinion I'll just be real honest I don't care about what I think what does he say what does he say because it's not my opinion that matters it's his opinion amen we're going to take those things captive to the Word of God because it's such a you know it's such a robbery where men will beat their wives down as as slaves saying oh they're in their place now they're not in their place sisters help me out as I said on Sunday amen right this goes on the internet someone else may see it but you know men who beat their wives down that's not being that's not being Christ to his to his wife that's not a reflection of what Jesus Christ us to us he doesn't beat you down he lifts you up who's being lifted up love lifted me love lifted me no no we know it else but Christ could help what happened love lifted me amen and they say hallelujah and they've got the truncheon down like this at the same time something hasn't happened to them right they do not know what grace is all they know is law you say but my culture cares about culture it's a true message culture is a true heaven culture that's what we want this is not a Western message or an Eastern message this is a heaven message so we want our minds to be stayed on him we don't want to think of thoughts we're going to stay positive now this is from from a message if you don't mind the reading thou son of David have mercy on me 1961 he sees this he says go right on down the road no matter what school keeps or not if it don't you turn we turn the teacher out and just go right on believing the Lord see keep meditations upon God think on these things the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things well our thoughts are always negative we come into a prayer line I noticed they come in the prayer line Oh FFF he will tell me if if it is if at this oh my you never get nothing like that no you're so negative to begin with come like that come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains that sit come with faith believing he that cometh to God must believe that he is and the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him see never come with maybe it will work that's negative so closer or maybe he will maybe he reward me maybe you know no he's our water you must who believes that he is who believes it is and he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him who's diligently sought him amen and who's been found of him who who's been rewarded amen he says I'm not going to go through all Roberts Prayer Line then go through Tommy Hicks prayer line then go through Osborne's prayer line Ellen's prayer line Brandon's prayer line and so on so prayer line go to this church in that church why you're just wasting time that's all that's all the thing to do is just just say and make up your mind that is God and God said so and I'm going to meet his requirements and that settles it forever amen that's it God said so go out to my pastor say pastor the Bible tells us to call the elders anoint them and oil pray over the prayer of faith shall save the sick that's all I have to know amen amen that's all if God said it that's it it's done well will it work get get that out of your mind if he said it it'll happen amen now this is me don't combat negative thoughts replace them this thing you know we become creatures of habit not in just physically what we do but our thought pattern it becomes predictable we begin to think a certain way certain situations come up we react the same way because we've programmed ourselves to look at things a certain way and think you know if all this happens well this is how I react or if this happens is how I think you know many times that's got to be done away with we need a reprogramming a ment we need to be reset amen I know I think brother Andy talked about in a subconscious series but it's true the the pathways in the brain can constantly change based on how you think and so that's why you've got to look at how you think if you begin to think well we'll never really happen for me and I've been in this for years and nothing has ever really happened you ought to get rid of that I mean you got to get rid of that forget about what you've been thinking about in the past say Lord your word is true you've made me a believer I believe in the power of your Redemption that settles it here I come Lord Jesus amen he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and then they'll says well you tried before who cares about before who cares about yesterday forgetting the things which are in the past the scripture says forget about it it'll say put it on the Shelf when you feel bad pick it up and read about it forget it forget it well well I failed yesterday who cares but if you sincerely said Lord forgive me pick me up try me one more time it's done it's done away with God doesn't remember how many times we come to and say Lord you know I did this and I've done this and I've done this and it's the millionth time you've said those things to him and he looks at you saying what are you talking about let's look at my file no let's look at my Great Hall of Records it's not there what oh but I did this I did this and he says no he didn't do this but we get caught up and such a what do you call it a guilt complex and our mind is filled with guilt all the time oh he could never forgive me and he could and that's the devil trying to give you his experience because he can't be forgiven because there's no blood for him God didn't die for angels he died for you I mean he didn't Redemption they're not on the plan of redemption we're in the plan of redemption amen so we're good it's gotta get up it's not him the falls at him that gets up I meant you may be knocked down a million times just get up a million and one and that's the one that matters they meant Abraham Lincoln went for public office about eleven times before he became successful you would think that man would have got discouraged but he didn't get discouraged he became the president of the United States at a very crucial hour in their history and he spoke a very short address that Guinea Gettysburg Address and it rallied the nation and they won the war they meant it's not them that lose the battle it's them that win the war that matters they are the victors in the end amen you can lose basically every battle except the last one but if the last one wins you the war that all that's all that matters who cares you know how'd the campaign go pretty bad until the last one I won the whole thing hallelujah my enemies did I'm alive that's all that matters amen so you say well I've lost you know it takes real grit and determination you maybe you've been knocked around your entire life put it into it I'm not going to entertain that thinking anymore I'm not going to sit in the defeated if you're a corner anymore I mean my god is victorious I'm not looking at me his blood is more than enough amen if it can if he can set Legion free if he can set the woman at the well free if he can take the apostles who were illiterate and you know then know left and right and all that stuff and make them this let's person yo this is my church you know when God Jesus is here he's gathering his children comes into his ministry he gathers Peter James and John come follow me I need to go by the way of Samaria speaks to the woman of the world is Mary Magdalene all these different ones he's looking them saying this is my church these are my precious ones amen you know the high priest wasn't cold all those ones weren't called Pilate wasn't part of him doesn't matter how holy or the priests were he wasn't looking at them he one I want a tax collector in there hallelujah I want all these people of ill-fame these are the ones that they're going to be the power fulfillment of the Prophet Joel I'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh hallelujah they were part of that fulfillment and the Jews would look at the great big holy temple and although priests had to be a certain way and here were these ones that had bad names they had bad histories hey follow me I mean though the outcasts of society and God was looking any spaces here I don't care about this temple it's just a pollution in my nose but these are the ones who give me a real sacrifice of price these are the ones I really want to worship me I don't just want the blood of bulls and gods and somehow would religion that means nothing these ones don't really praise me hallelujah we have to forget our past doesn't matter what you were what are you what are you now as I see it many times about Caleb and Joshua they had the same scars from Egypt as the others but they weren't feeling they weren't too concerned about the scars they said we have a promise I've received a promise from a vindicated prophet amen that his word came true and it will come true to take us in the land and I've taken this promise and let's go take it now why are we sitting here on this place the desert may be nice for some people by my understand or a desert on a land of milk and honey I want my inheritance hallelujah they didn't care about their slave what they were they weren't slaves anymore amen if God is able to call you out of the world and open your eyes you may even have your eye a little bit open but is it starting to open a menace like someone who's beginning to get well they can either look at well I'm still in a in a body cast but maybe the day before they couldn't even move their finger but those so a positive saying I can look I couldn't move it yesterday let's move and they're in the body cos I don't know you know but and it's like well what's the main thing did they have more victory today than they have yesterday I'd say yes because they can move their finger and maybe the next day maybe you're all the fingers I can feel feeling in my toes today hallelujah amen you got a look at the victories that you're getting I meant hey if he can do a little bit he can do the whole thing that's what I'm trying to say amen now brother Brahim sees this and influenced 1963 I just want to say this first imagine if we all came to church one mind one heart one Accord didn't matter what anyone thought didn't matter what the people were doing next you in front of you behind you whatever things love covers a multitude of sin doesn't matter what's going on in that place and over there you're not concerned about things you've come to worship God you come to give them praise you come to worship Him you'll prayed up you're under expectation I mean you want to see God move baby it was not for you it's for the person next to you I mean you want to see people be filled with the Holy Ghost people be healed people be set free what if we were that kind of mind God make the service leave human control that's what I want to see from the musicians of the song leader to the minister team and the congregation back to the Sundays Lord make it leave human control take it totally in your control what if we were that kind of way and the devil says can it really happen I believe it can really happen I believe it can really happen well when this gets out of the way God takes us and we worship Him like we really want to worship Him I mean the very life in us comes forth we say hallelujah Oh Lord Jesus you're wonderful I don't want to wait to begin around a throne you're here in your spirit form I want to worship you in the cellar all been washed I've been redeemed I've been set free hallelujah to the lamb I've been healed I've been restored I've been renewed or glory to God as any wonderful then you want to wish him that way I mean weak just come and just worship and we become one one voice singing glory to the lamb Oh hallelujah to the lamb all my Jesus I love the I know that what mine or glory to your name Lord God hallelujah oh how great that water God How Great Thou art hallelujah to the soul hallelujah amen I believe it can happen I mean I believe it all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah that we can be more than a group of individuals will be one body moving with one mind one a call will be lifted up Lord be glorified Lord be worship Lord be a daughter God receive praise our Lord receive honor and glory and blessing a price Oh God hallelujah hallelujah to the lamb hallelujah hey darlin that's why we come to church we don't come to hear a lecture we run here to some lend some learn something and we hear that God would come down and God would wash the world out of us change our minds change our hearts bring us in line with his word that's why we come to church that's why I come to church that I know about you I mean that he have come and do surgery go down by spirit room and change me mold me holy are miss clay he's the Potter Oh work on me Oh God change me Oh God I don't want to be the same person I was yesterday I don't want to rest on history I'm going to walk with you today hallelujah coming mold being shaped me make me a vessel of honor and a great away hallelujah we are his workmanship work on me Oh God I mean you see the devil captures people's imagination then he slips in a spirit that's why people your entertainment everything they begin to relax they begin to enjoy it the evil comes in through deception and that that same devil comes and sits next to you and says don't enjoy what he's saying don't even listen you got better things to worry about what about tomorrow what's gonna do and he gets your ma and you're all tense you know 99% of times I trust maybe trust us is only our experience we get here to there and it's like we're all stressed let's just get there come on this one this one put this on Hawaii tell you know we get all like this and it happens that way for a reason because the devil's like I'm going to shake you up twist you around that when you get here it'll take you the whole service just to calm down again amen and in my mind I think well the more that happens the greater it's going to be hallelujah because he just wants to upset you upset you're thinking that you just think about what oh I can't believe I did this oh I'd never do this and why did I do this put it under the blood put it under this blood there's blood is flowing from Calvary fountain put it under how long does it take just a few seconds Lord I'm sorry forgive me have my way and he says it's going what and you've got to leave it there and walk on and walk on and then we come to church he wants to worship the devil doesn't want you to worship God he wants us to be cold to be indifferent I mean to be hostile to our brother and sister I mean just to put up a front oh god bless you and then you're there but then in your heart you're like where can I put my dagger in I'm looking for a weak spot I always knew though that way hold on we don't want to turn out that way it should be I'm so glad you're here he comes another look of fire he comes another part of the body together hallelu is going to be more glorious because you're here holy wouldn't be the same Amen without you here or we're going to have church today hallelujah Amen now he sees Dell and then when so this is an influence and then when you raise up from there with a real confession a real cleansing then when the call comes who go for us in Isaiah you can answer Here I am send me your life will influence your family I trust you all hundred percent say yes I want me to influence Lord the life and me will influence my family amen it'll influence your neighbor it'll influence your church he says you just put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than 40 revivals you could have can I just I just going to repeat that maybe another two times all you think because we think all we want to revival you know I say praise love we want a revival 40 revivals is an incredible thing you're in Uganda right now I think it's been about three or four months maybe even shorter they've had to 2,600 people baptized come to this message come out denomination pastors everything that's revival hallelujah he's the same God here as he is there amen but he says they'll know there's that kind of revival but he says you just put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than 40 revivals you could have Amen now you say oh there can be brother so-and-so sister so so they like you I mean I mean I mean they're like that well what about you Amen let the revival like those ones from I think America they went to Wales during the Welsh revival you know and they're trying to find where it is and there's a there's a policeman with your swing is bet on whistling something he says and they say good sir can you tell us where the Welsh revival is he says it's in me you're looking at it here it is hallelujah shouldn't there be the same thing with us a good cleanse member set an example with a face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God not not long face long hair long skirts you know long face not long face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God and watch when somebody get SiC they'll call that person to come and pray or you make fun of them and their tyre is deflated and so forth you might say all this nonsense but let death strike you one time you'll find out the end end struggles begin to come who that real sincere person is in the church why not you why not now don't put it on there can be someone else's job what about you what about me two or three good members waste is one or two that are really on fire for God it'll do more for that church than 40 revivals and there are revivals just an awakening Amen that's a powerful statement I've began to think well Lord Lord if you said that there's a reason Elijah said that to us and he's not saying it just to paint some picture that we can never obtain he's saying you just let this happen you'll find it's better than 40 revivals now brother Branham now I'm closing brother Branham and his wife they had a real consecration to give up their free will give up their negative thoughts lay it all upon the altar one more time now if a prophet had to do that from time and he did it more than once how about us that we can lay aside our negative thoughts of maybe it'll maybe it won't happen maybe it's not for me Oh it'll never be that way again you don't lay those things aside amen let's stand shall we let's pray together as a people let's consecrate ourselves to the Lord amen it's all pray gracious father Lord God we thank you we can have this time
