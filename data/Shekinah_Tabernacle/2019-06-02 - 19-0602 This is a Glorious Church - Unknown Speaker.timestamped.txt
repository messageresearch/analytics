[26:52] like the answer that God gives and so

[27:02] first song that came up and it had only
[27:04] just come out like had literally just
[27:05] been released on YouTube like a week
[27:07] before and it just really matched the
[27:18] situation and the thing I was going
[27:20] through and reaffirmed God's answer to
[27:23] me and then that Sunday I performed as a
[27:27] church and even just sitting pre-service
[27:28] I was reading one of the elderly
[27:30] strengths and and and the brother

[50:59] while you standing will just read a
[51:00] scripture quickly amen and praise the
[51:05] Lord will read Acts chapter 2 and then
[51:08] maybe you can also keep him and
[51:10] Ephesians chapter 5 amen well known
[51:17] scripture Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and the
[51:20] Bible says and when the day of Pentecost
[51:22] was fully come they were all with one
[51:24] Accord in one place and suddenly they
[51:26] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[51:28] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[51:31] where they were sitting and they
[51:33] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[51:35] as a fire and it sat upon each of them
[51:37] and they were all filled with the Holy
[51:39] Ghost and began to speak with other
[51:41] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[51:43] utterance amen and in just one more
[51:45] scripture Ephesians 5 praise the Lord
[51:49] amen
[51:50] I believe it's 27 visions 5:27
[51:56] and it says that he might present it to
[51:58] himself a glorious church not having
[52:02] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[52:05] that it should be holy and without
[52:07] blemish may the Lord bless the reading
[52:10] of his word you may be seated in his
[52:11] presence amen amen so god bless you this
[52:15] morning a man and just greetings in the
[52:18] precious name of Jesus Christ amen I
[52:21] have to admit I have to be honest I mean
[52:23] we were we were very tempted just to
[52:25] slip in again like we did the last time
[52:27] and just come to church
[52:29] mmm but I felt it wouldn't be the right
[52:30] thing to do a man but we were very
[52:32] tempted M about God bless you this
[52:34] morning when I greet you all in the
[52:35] precious name of Jesus amen pressure our

[52:54] when my calling in church is to worship
[52:56] God amen and I just don't need a church
[53:00] to do that it's my life
[53:02] worshiping God because I consider myself
[53:05] to be in Revelation chapter 5 Amen I I
[53:09] say because the brother branham said
[53:11] John types the bride and so if John
[53:14] types the bride and if I say I'm the
[53:15] bride then man because the Bible says in
[53:18] Revelation 5 everyone in heaven and
[53:20] earth under the earth said John said

[53:34] I contrary to popular opinion I I
[53:36] sometimes think I'm a bit of an
[53:38] introvert but then the Holy Ghost took
[53:41] over amen so I used to be an introvert
[53:44] and the Holy Ghost took over and since
[53:46] the Holy Ghost took over Amen I I make
[53:49] my presence known

[59:19] I'm a believer this morning amen and so
[59:21] since then I've been serving God and
[59:23] it's been rough that's been rough it's
[59:26] been rough brothers sisters it's been
[59:29] rough but it's been worth it all it's
[59:31] been worth it all hey man I remember
[59:34] brother Branham said when he was going
[59:36] through by the trials and the
[59:37] questioning they asked him so what kept
[59:39] you program said it was that thing that
[59:42] new birth that are dropped into his soul
[59:45] he said that kept him you said brother
[59:48] father what kept you it was that new
[59:50] birth dropped in my soul that's what
[59:53] kept me amen and that's why wherever we
[59:56] go brother acts 19 do you have Holy
[59:58] Ghost arm in the message I don't care do
[1:00:00] you have the Holy Ghost oh I know
[1:00:02] brother branham I don't care do you have
[1:00:04] the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[1:00:06] says that you and God are connected
[1:00:09] that's what connects you the picture
[1:00:12] brother Graham doesn't connect you to
[1:00:13] God the Holy Ghost connects you to God
[1:00:17] because the Holy Ghost God drops a part
[1:00:20] of himself in your soul now you ain't
[1:00:24] God or connected that's what happened
[1:00:30] brother
[1:00:31] that's what happened 83 God threw up
[1:00:33] something in my soul God and I got
[1:00:35] connected hey man we've been connected
[1:00:37] for 30 odd years yes I know I come from
[1:00:42] God I know that but I was born in sin
[1:00:45] shaped in iniquity yes I had a seed of
[1:00:49] representation plucked some along the
[1:00:52] line we got disconnected
[1:00:55] but in 31st of December Lord and I we
[1:00:59] got connected brother hallelujah amen
[1:01:06] and it's been awesome it's been awesome
[1:01:09] yes I fell yes I made mistakes
[1:01:12] but something keeps holding me and I
[1:01:15] tell you this morning young people if
[1:01:17] you get connected hey man what David's
[1:01:21] that was yong-nam old tell Jenny Jenny
[1:01:24] says we're getting old I said I don't
[1:01:25] join that conversation Fewster he says
[1:01:30] yeah but Ferdie we can't do what we used
[1:01:32] I said I don't care what you say so

[1:17:23] God let God inside of you
[1:17:25] look for himself and I will preach it

[1:17:37] it hard because they trying to oh
[1:17:40] brother you know I'm struggling to pray
[1:17:43] I'm struggling to dress right I'm
[1:17:46] struggling there is your problem you are
[1:17:51] struggling you know what I did I let God
[1:17:54] campaign and I let God love a Christian
[1:17:59] life through me no big deal no big deal
[1:18:10] you know you know you know what the
[1:18:13] young guys your brother gotta turn my
[1:18:14] head so why do you want to turn you hit
[1:18:18] her brother
[1:18:19] the naked women oh brother let God tell
[1:18:24] you hit and that's what I tell the young
[1:18:27] people I tell everybody you know the
[1:18:29] sick year yeah here's the message I'll
[1:18:31] give you the message in a nutshell you
[1:18:33] know we always say you know because when
[1:18:35] people look at the when we present the
[1:18:37] message to people we present a whole
[1:18:39] bunch of do's and don'ts all right don't
[1:18:42] do this don't do that don't do that
[1:18:44] don't do that
[1:18:46] just us don't sisters don't and with
[1:18:49] wonder why people find it odd and so we
[1:18:52] tell our young people how no social
[1:18:54] media no Facebook no this no YouTube
[1:18:57] notice no that and then our kids go
[1:19:00] behind our back and they do it I told my
[1:19:04] wife I said social media there is no
[1:19:06] problem with social media how can you
[1:19:10] blame Facebook for the problems in the
[1:19:12] world when Facebook is simply a bunch of
[1:19:16] computers and a website now you show me
[1:19:20] how Facebook a bunch of computers and a
[1:19:23] website causes problems no it's the
[1:19:27] users of the tool that causes problems
[1:19:33] so we don't have to educate Facebook
[1:19:36] educate the user so what do we do what
[1:19:43] do I do
[1:19:44] I'm not gonna stop well I can't stop the
[1:19:46] girls are mean too late for that that
[1:19:49] bird is flown in the 20s how do I stop
[1:19:53] that you know and I get told we get told
[1:19:55] that I'm an adult so praise the Lord I'm
[1:19:57] Adam
[1:20:00] you know I mean so what do we do so what
[1:20:03] I disc I decided we decided when we were
[1:20:06] younger the kids were younger we decided
[1:20:08] let's get God in the house then God in
[1:20:18] their heart we'll teach them how to deal
[1:20:21] with Facebook so when my kids were
[1:20:27] younger we did not have a monitoring
[1:20:30] system on the Internet it was open I did
[1:20:36] not trust them I trusted the God that I
[1:20:41] served would keep them and so when we
[1:20:45] get God inside of them it's God inside
[1:20:50] of them that controls the ice I can sit
[1:20:59] on my rocking chair put my head back
[1:21:01] have a cup of coffee blanket over my lap
[1:21:04] and Jamie and I we can rock away
[1:21:07] they got God on the inside so I don't
[1:21:10] have to monitor them I don't have to run
[1:21:13] off of them
[1:21:17] I don't have to check their browser
[1:21:21] history where were they on sites I don't
[1:21:25] have to think of God on the inside and
[1:21:31] God on the inside is the antivirus
[1:21:35] protection it's God that does it not me
[1:21:44] God is easy I put my head on Apple I go
[1:21:49] sleep at night they go visit their
[1:21:51] friends wherever they are having Apollo
[1:21:53] well as a dad you wanna monitor what
[1:21:55] time they come and when they are where
[1:21:56] they are but I don't have to worry God
[1:22:00] an insight and so now when we come to
[1:22:02] the young people we don't have to tell
[1:22:04] them for now now young go let's check
[1:22:06] your your length of your dress we don't
[1:22:09] have to walk with a tape measure it
[1:22:10] checked the height of your shoe and
[1:22:12] brother let's see how you dress it's
[1:22:16] tiresome it's tiresome you know it's
[1:22:20] like it's tiresome so what we do we make
[1:22:25] sure they have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:22:28] what we do that's all we do
[1:22:30] do you have only those my brother even I
[1:22:33] get it and we will create an environment
[1:22:36] for them to get it we will make sure the
[1:22:40] environment is
[1:22:44] problems so now I'm not I'm not a pastor
[1:22:55] right but as far as I'm concerned that's
[1:22:57] easy that makes it easy dealing with the
[1:23:00] church then everyone in the church gets
[1:23:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:14] our precious sister doesn't have to go
[1:23:16] check up where these big kids offers
[1:23:19] like what the Holy Ghost no problem
[1:23:21] if I don't see them for the day who
[1:23:23] cares they've got the Holy Ghost the
[1:23:25] Holy Ghost will look after them
[1:23:27] so I say now this is just Ferdie right
[1:23:29] there's my opinion so I don't preach
[1:23:31] against social media I don't preach
[1:23:34] against Internet and against mobile
[1:23:37] phones and you're either blood or mobile
[1:23:39] phones or iniquity iniquity let's poor
[1:23:43] thing is dead men and the only reason
[1:23:46] I've got this thing with me is the
[1:23:47] monitor the time all right so that's the
[1:23:49] only reason there's no clock it's only
[1:23:51] reason it's yeah this thing is dead the
[1:23:54] poor thing gets blamed for everything
[1:23:56] let's be serious
[1:23:58] this thing gets blamed for him so we as
[1:24:01] parents I won't give my child a mobile
[1:24:03] phone and I won't give my child this and
[1:24:05] my child doesn't have internet access
[1:24:07] and my child doesn't do this and my
[1:24:09] child doesn't do that and we're not
[1:24:12] preparing our children for the big world
[1:24:14] and then we wonder why our kids can't
[1:24:17] cope in the big world
[1:24:20] the kid is 30 years old still locked in
[1:24:23] their bedroom
[1:24:24] and now as a parent we start worrying oh
[1:24:28] honey much your child the way your child
[1:24:34] is as a result of how you read them now
[1:24:38] I wish I could let on saying so I won't
[1:24:42] say that but that's what I'm saying
[1:24:43] so Mira's children are as a result of
[1:24:47] hey how we taught him and so we made
[1:24:50] sure they get the Holy Ghost we make
[1:24:52] sure everybody in the church gets the
[1:24:53] Holy Ghost we make sure Thank You
[1:24:55] Barbara and you
[1:24:57] is it and so now this message that I'm
[1:25:02] in I want Christ and so all of a sudden
[1:25:07] my perspective on the message has
[1:25:09] changed I'm not telling people now do
[1:25:12] you know brother Branham do you know
[1:25:13] brother Branham no I'm telling him do
[1:25:16] you know Christ
[1:25:16] do you know Christ have you met Christ
[1:25:20] because I want to tell you this there
[1:25:21] are too many people in the message that
[1:25:24] don't know Christ and that's your
[1:25:27] problem
[1:25:28] there are too many people who don't know
[1:25:30] Christ but if we can get the people to
[1:25:34] Christ that creeps official not to
[1:25:40] knowledge not knowledge of the word or
[1:25:43] this mystery that mystery brother I'd
[1:25:46] rather not know any mystery but know
[1:25:49] Christ
[1:25:50] what if Paul say that I might know him
[1:25:55] and that's my call my man is to get to
[1:25:59] know Christ not just say Brian I know
[1:26:02] about but to know him so my whole
[1:26:07] perspective on how I deal with young
[1:26:09] people has changed because in the
[1:26:12] earlier years
[1:26:13] it used to be the law the law the law
[1:26:18] and you hard and you know mercian and
[1:26:23] you may not just kneel you look at them
[1:26:26] they look strange and you rebuke them
[1:26:28] and all you do is you got the Bibles of
[1:26:31] banging you so we do always to do if
[1:26:35] rather than in II was here he would have
[1:26:37] said ima because he realizes that's all
[1:26:39] we did
[1:26:39] nailed him so I said no I we had a chat
[1:26:43] I had a chat with the past lesson and he
[1:26:45] was saying maybe we we change our
[1:26:47] approach so if you come to our church
[1:26:49] our approach has changed so if a woman
[1:26:52] or a sister walks into the church in a
[1:26:55] trouser and we have in communion and she
[1:26:58] wants to come and have communion come
[1:27:00] and have communion
[1:27:05] and if a guy comes in and he's got an
[1:27:07] earring in his year and he comes from in
[1:27:09] the certain church and he says brother I
[1:27:11] want to take communion
[1:27:12] let's have communion because we not
[1:27:15] judgmental because what we're charge of
[1:27:19] love but I want to let you know we don't
[1:27:23] compromise on this because this is love
[1:27:28] we don't compromise on this we stand on
[1:27:32] this but we love them anyhow what about
[1:27:39] that woman that that Jesus that got
[1:27:41] caught in adultery come on you legolas
[1:27:46] tell me about that woman that got caught
[1:27:49] in adultery you know your brother's in
[1:27:52] I'm sure but I've been is none of them
[1:27:54] here but you get browsing the chest it's
[1:27:55] just waiting man for off the chest
[1:27:57] because they want to get you in the word
[1:27:59] I challenge the man there she was caught
[1:28:06] drag to Jesus she was caught and this is
[1:28:09] your loss says your Lord says and there
[1:28:13] was the law giver the one who had
[1:28:15] written the law he was the law and the
[1:28:19] law said he must hey you know what they
[1:28:21] say someone heard somebody said well
[1:28:23] normally the law says the man and the
[1:28:25] human must be stoned and the man wasn't
[1:28:26] there that's what the humans are come on
[1:28:28] come on man stop complicating stuff the
[1:28:33] law said stone and they stood the law
[1:28:37] and the Lord looked at her and the law
[1:28:40] said you were out sin cast the first
[1:28:41] stone and the lawyer looked around
[1:28:44] where's your accusers where's your
[1:28:47] peeresses how they walked away and Jesus
[1:28:50] neither do I accuse day
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:58] that was law tinged with love that was
[1:29:03] law encapsulated in love that was law
[1:29:07] wrapped with love and that's how we
[1:29:10] present Christ we don't present Christ
[1:29:15] as a judge and he'll come to that part
[1:29:18] but right now we present Christ with

[1:52:31] but that's what you do that's what I do
[1:52:34] sometimes next morning you're coming
[1:52:37] you'll say let's start this meeting
[1:52:37] again and I'm saying let's tell the
[1:52:41] devil don't wait for him to end the
[1:52:47] meeting interrupt him Midway tell him
[1:52:56] Satan do you know that hell was created
[1:53:00] for you and your demons and you've been
[1:53:05] trying to drag me down with you but the
[1:53:08] Bible says it was created for you Satan
[1:53:10] and your demons not for me and you tell
[1:53:15] the devil right Satan we're gonna now
[1:53:17] delete that reoccurring event that's in
[1:53:20] our calendar and some of you look at me
[1:53:28] as a bride talking nonsense and the fact
[1:53:32] that you have that attitude says you
[1:53:33] have a reoccurring event and the fact is
[1:53:35] the devil is so in control of your
[1:53:38] meetings he doesn't even wait for after
[1:53:39] church how rude how rude of the devil
[1:53:44] that when you in church he has his
[1:53:48] meeting with you how rude and you sit
[1:53:57] then he has the meeting and then he has
[1:53:59] the audacity to tell you tell their
[1:54:00] little colored boy shut up and you sit
[1:54:04] there with your attitude or whatever and
[1:54:06] you're having your meeting with a devil
[1:54:07] and you're not even listening to what
[1:54:09] God is saying over the pulpit but I want
[1:54:12] to say this morning let's call that
[1:54:13] meeting to an end and let's tell the
[1:54:16] devil we're not only calling this
[1:54:18] meeting to an end we are cancelling the
[1:54:20] reoccurring event in our calendar and
[1:54:23] you can't listen listen listen I hate
[1:54:27] him
[1:54:28] might as well let you know I hate the
[1:54:30] devil
[1:54:32] and he does the devil does everything he
[1:54:35] can to kill me and I am doing everything
[1:54:38] I can to kill him but yes the doctrines
[1:54:48] yes the difference his end is written in
[1:54:52] the book of Revelation
[1:54:57] that's his end my end you look in
[1:55:01] Revelation 5 you find about me and you
[1:55:05] look in Revelation 10 and you find about
[1:55:07] me and you're looking first
[1:55:09] Thessalonians 4:16
[1:55:10] and you'll read about me I know he's in
[1:55:15] ICU tell him that you tell him right
[1:55:19] that's it done we're not having this
[1:55:21] anymore that's the challenge to young
[1:55:25] people that's the challenge you can
[1:55:29] continue a reoccurring meeting we draw
[1:55:31] to an end that's it this meeting ends as
[1:55:36] of now I'm a child of God I'm part of
[1:55:41] that glorious church this meeting ends

[1:59:21] seventh church anniversary do you know
[1:59:24] who you are can you say look at me I'm a
[1:59:27] wonder I carry his glory and the Bible
[1:59:31] says Paul says we are changing from
[1:59:34] glory and to glory from glory and to
[1:59:39] glory on the outside age ages crueler
[1:59:46] amen but on the inside
[1:59:50] I'm changing and do you know the body
[1:59:53] change is from the inside out
[1:59:58] the world gets it wrong so the world
[2:00:01] tries to change them and you know what
[2:00:03] church you know watch it you know what
[2:00:05] that's what we try to do with young
[2:00:07] people we try to change our young people
[2:00:10] from the outside and we kept hammering
[2:00:13] on our young people how to behave what
[2:00:15] to wear what to do what not to do what
[2:00:18] what what we kept hammering on that and
[2:00:20] then we were wondering why it never
[2:00:22] worked and then we discovered it happens
[2:00:27] from the inside out where did I blow
[2:00:31] hams body change come from inside out
[2:00:35] and so yes the outer man is finishing oh
[2:00:40] brother
[2:00:41] Ottoman is perishing look at this after
[2:00:43] man I didn't look like this when we got
[2:00:47] married 27 years ago i Jane I didn't
[2:00:49] look like this eh
[2:00:51] believe it or not I was handsome
[2:00:58] unbelievers yeah I can't be had hey
[2:01:09] brothers that wasn't a fro either I was
[2:01:15] godly brother koukin I kept the short I
[2:01:18] had a I had when I got married I never
[2:01:21] had what you see now never had I wait 59
[2:01:26] kgs when I got married
[2:01:27] and up till today my wife wants to know
[2:01:30] what I weigh and I refused to tell her
[2:01:34] so the outer man is perishing the outer
[2:01:37] man when I like my brother branham said
[2:01:39] when brother branham's wife said belly
[2:01:41] you losing your hair brother branham
[2:01:43] told us it austere if you tell me where
[2:01:45] my hair was before I got it I'll tell
[2:01:47] you ladies now and I can say the same
[2:01:50] but I have a condition for God I
[2:01:52] shouldn't do that but I said God if you
[2:01:54] want to bring my hair back I'm happy
[2:01:56] with every but if you bring my hair back
[2:01:57] it's got a comeback blonde and straight
[2:02:05] is anything too hard for the Lord sister
[2:02:08] nothing but the outer man is perishing
[2:02:13] but the inner man is being renewed on a
[2:02:16] daily I can imagine Abram and Sarah one
[2:02:20] morning Abraham woke up and he looked
[2:02:21] across expecting to see the wrinkles and
[2:02:24] he saw a young woman a 90 year old
[2:02:29] grandmother that a king fell in love
[2:02:32] with she and thus King had access to the
[2:02:38] prettiest women but when he saw Sarah
[2:02:42] after her body had been changed he had
[2:02:46] never seen someone as fair Sarah
[2:02:50] he said I'm taking her and Abraham
[2:02:53] listen Abraham God's prophet the man of
[2:02:57] God he told his wife Sarah tell him I'm
[2:03:00] you see you my sister the Prophet lied
[2:03:04] the man of God lied so doesn't matter
[2:03:08] who you are you have your down moments
[2:03:09] and then you know the king said well
[2:03:11] your sister I'm gonna marry her and cost
[2:03:14] you a dead man and this is what I will
[2:03:16] show you the grace of God he Abraham
[2:03:20] lied and because he told lies the king
[2:03:23] took his wife because they though the
[2:03:27] king you give him back his wife and you
[2:03:29] get a liar to pray for you
[2:03:35] you see the lives of the devil
[2:03:38] so just because you failed God now the
[2:03:41] devil says your your liar you are devil
[2:03:43] and the devil makes you think you've
[2:03:47] lost your sonship
[2:03:48] you've lost your daughter shop you no
[2:03:50] more child and God makes then liar pray
[2:03:54] for you their king how does God work you
[2:03:59] know something else - you know Abraham
[2:04:01] lost ball so when God gave him the
[2:04:04] promise but when you go to Hebrews 11
[2:04:07] it's not faking it
[2:04:10] there's nothing in Hebrews 11 about
[2:04:15] Abram lying laughing do you find Sarah's
[2:04:20] laughing in Hebrews 11 you don't do you
[2:04:24] mean God forgot it yes God forgot it
[2:04:26] that whole church that doesn't know my
[2:04:30] just be pure so your failures doesn't
[2:04:37] come into God's reckoning your failures
[2:04:40] the devil reckons it your failures that
[2:04:43] give a reminds you're not God put on a
[2:04:47] bride a move on her parade what about
[2:04:52] David men
[2:04:53] so Bathsheba fell for the woman and God
[2:04:56] said your man after my own heart it's
[2:04:59] the same that is insane my head can't
[2:05:02] comprehend that that's the grace of God
[2:05:05] so stop listening to the lies of the
[2:05:07] devil
[2:05:08] stop listening to the lies of the devil
[2:05:10] the devil is a liar brother when do I
[2:05:14] know any stalling lies when he opens his
