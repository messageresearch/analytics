[30:10] I just yield myself to you all and I
[30:13] depend on you now
[30:14] and ask father that this congregation
[30:16] and all that here father would just give
[30:20] and er divided attention to the Word of
[30:23] God and recognize the magnitude and the
[30:26] importance or God of what is taking
[30:29] place right now I pray that your quicker
[30:31] net to us tonight father quicken that
[30:34] reality tonight to us father all cards
[30:39] that we may give our all to you and know
[30:43] and understand what is happening Jesus
[30:47] aim god bless you amen
[30:51] I want to thank brother Ben for allowing
[30:55] us to minister tonight and we do
[30:59] certainly pray for him amen because he's
[31:02] in a place that has got a lot of
[31:05] challenges physically and spiritually
[31:08] amen but if the Word of God is more
[31:11] powerful Amen Alleluia
[31:13] and we pray that the word go forth and
[31:15] accomplish that which God has purposed
[31:17] amen
[31:18] thank you musicians Lord amen without
[31:23] further ado let's turn in our Bibles to
[31:25] Luke chapter 9 verses 61 to 62 and we
[31:30] are going to speak tonight on moving
[31:32] with the pillar of fire moving with the
[31:35] vision of the pillar of fire amen
[31:38] hallelujah it is so important Amen that
[31:42] we move with the pillar of fire and if
[31:44] you don't know what I'm talking about
[31:45] we'll get into that and we'll explain it
[31:47] a bit later but I'll listen let me tell
[31:50] you it is life or death there's life or
[31:52] death whether you're moving with the
[31:54] pillar of fire or whether you're just
[31:56] coming to church or whether you're not
[31:58] coming to church whatever it may be
[32:00] whatever condition yeren now when I
[32:02] preach tonight don't think okay he's
[32:05] preaching at me because remember each
[32:07] one of us is a measure of of
[32:09] accountability to this thought amen
[32:13] and so it says here and another also
[32:16] said Lord I will follow thee but let me
[32:19] first go bid them farewell which are at
[32:22] home at my house and jesus said unto Him
[32:25] no men having put his hand to the plow
[32:28] and looking back as fit for the kingdom
[32:32] of God Lord had your blessing to the
[32:35] reading of your word father and you
[32:37] maybe have your seats Amen in the
[32:40] presence of the Lord tonight this is
[32:45] quite a an alarming scripture and I've
[32:49] always thought about it and I thought
[32:50] well you know for me personally when I
[32:54] first read this I thought well okay you
[32:59] know my legalistic side of me starts
[33:00] rising up thinking okay well I've been a
[33:02] you know the moment I start looking at
[33:04] the things of the world again I'm out
[33:05] but it's not quite like that this is
[33:08] more of an attitude of your life this is
[33:10] more what is your life saying where are
[33:13] you looking what is important to you
[33:14] what is most important to you and what
[33:17] is most important to you as your God and
[33:20] what is most important to you your life
[33:23] not what you say but your life will
[33:26] testify of what is most important to you
[33:29] and there's two things there and we're
[33:32] not going to this this is just where you
[33:34] boil everything down that's either your
[33:36] will or God's will and if you're going
[33:39] to worship your own will then your will
[33:43] will be more important to you than God's
[33:45] will and let me tell you this right at
[33:47] the for gun God's will for you is to be
[33:49] part of the vision God's will for you is
[33:52] to be part of the vision that he's
[33:54] opened in this area amen this might not
[33:58] look like much
[33:59] amen it'd been might be only 32 or
[34:02] something not some 60 year old known all
[34:05] around the world sort of international
[34:06] evangelist or a minister or pasta but
[34:09] you see God has opened a vision God has
[34:12] opened a fountain in the house of David
[34:14] a man is so we don't want to despise the
[34:17] days of small things even though I don't
[34:20] think it is a small thing I think it's a
[34:21] big thing a man I believe it's a big
[34:24] thing now God's will for us us to be
[34:27] 100% part of this vision 100% effort Lee
[34:32] all of our energy everything that we can
[34:35] give which is practical to this vision a
[34:39] man I thought I'll lay that down right
[34:42] at the start a man because we go through
[34:45] some examples in the scriptures of just
[34:47] how important it is to to know what the
[34:50] vision is you know some people are in a
[34:52] place where there isn't that much of a
[34:54] vision the visions being clouded over
[34:55] because it's not no one's exempt from
[34:58] having a vision be clouded over no
[35:00] churches exempt from coming under that
[35:03] attack and actually falling to their
[35:06] attack and losing their vision and
[35:08] becoming clouded over yet there
[35:10] eagle-eye getting filmed over and we'll
[35:14] go into exactly what happens with one
[35:16] case and the scripture later on
[35:20] I want to just look at now Nehemiah
[35:23] Nehemiah there's such a powerful thing
[35:27] and I a powerful story in the scriptures
[35:30] and it was just wonderful listening to
[35:32] the ministry on Sunday regarding
[35:35] Nehemiah and the attack of Sanballat and
[35:39] we remember the attack of Sanballat and
[35:42] you don't know you probably remember
[35:44] when I did the subconscious series one
[35:47] of the last sermons was also on that and
[35:49] I went it's a great detail about how the
[35:53] rebuilding of those stones the
[35:54] rebuilding of that wall and I also want
[35:57] to go back a little bit further now and
[35:59] we want I want to talk about with a
[36:02] vision opened for Nehemiah with a vision
[36:05] opened for this country to have their
[36:08] walls restored to have their safety
[36:11] restored to have their their protection
[36:13] restored so that they can resist the
[36:15] enemy so that they can discern the enemy
[36:17] so that they can rise up and that temple
[36:19] can take its place and Dominion in that
[36:21] city and this can all happen inside your
[36:24] own life if you're willing in the face
[36:27] of the enemy in the face of all your
[36:30] secret faults and every other voice if
[36:32] you're willing to let your whole life
[36:34] die so that God can live so that you can
[36:37] worship Him and you can worship his will
[36:39] that you
[36:40] you can give your ever teacher and your
[36:42] energy to put them first and your life
[36:46] will show it your life well sure not
[36:49] your revelation and the word but I tell
[36:52] you if your revelation and the word is
[36:53] from God your life will will show a
[36:56] positive a positive wholesome ever
[36:58] dedication to the vision that is open
[37:01] and become a functioning fully
[37:03] functioning part of that vision in the
[37:06] face of all the enemy in a face of all
[37:08] of Hollywood in the face of all of
[37:09] babylons image that has been pushed down
[37:12] over this people pushed down over this
[37:14] earth and is pressing down trying to
[37:16] pressure the church to Train helped to
[37:19] take a from putting their hand to the
[37:21] plow and then looking back and wondering
[37:23] about this oh I better go worry about my
[37:26] family first all my children come first
[37:28] I've got to what for the safety of my
[37:30] children we won't partake in this it
[37:31] means in the church for the sake of this
[37:33] I've got to go see my parents so we'll
[37:36] work go to that convention what's more
[37:38] important what I tell you I asked you
[37:42] what in your whole life family anything
[37:45] that you can possibly think of is more
[37:47] important than partaking of the vision
[37:49] of the Lord I can tell you this that if
[37:53] you will I believe the bride will get
[37:55] the revelation of this she will see it
[37:58] in this life or death that unless you
[38:02] are a hundred percent partaking of that
[38:04] vision how can you expect to have Retro
[38:07] in faith if you're just sitting there
[38:09] detached and when you come to church
[38:15] because she hadn't been a part of the
[38:16] vision you haven't been there all the
[38:17] time you don't you haven't seen the
[38:19] pillar of fire move when he moves and
[38:21] you've got to catch up when you're at
[38:23] the service so so your services when
[38:25] you're at church you're catching up on
[38:27] what's happened and you've missed this
[38:28] and that and this and that because other
[38:30] things are more important to you than
[38:31] the vision of the law and I might not be
[38:34] preaching to people in here but this is
[38:36] just going out you know so let the chips
[38:38] fall where they may God reveal to you
[38:42] and each one of us the importance of
[38:44] this because we don't want to just come
[38:46] to service to catch up on what's being
[38:48] preached and catch up you know we want
[38:50] to be part of this it's so important
[38:52] because in this is the very innocent
[38:55] they sound deeper you know I'm just like
[38:56] that the DNA of God the DNA of God the
[39:00] very building blocks of his personality
[39:02] the building blocks of his revelation of
[39:04] the identity of the very God that is
[39:08] within you and your own identity it's
[39:11] coming forth little by little little by
[39:13] little little by little and every
[39:15] service you miss you're missing out on
[39:17] that identity you're missing out on it
[39:19] streaming is not the same and you may
[39:23] watch the services later and you'll get
[39:25] a little bit in a little bit but it's
[39:26] there's an atmosphere amen and it's not
[39:30] just about you receiving it it's about
[39:33] you being part of it it's about you
[39:35] pulling on us about your faith involved
[39:37] a man because there's demon powers and
[39:40] principalities that are against this
[39:42] vision coming forth they're pushing it
[39:44] down discouraging the leadership
[39:46] discouraging and trying to to to fight
[39:49] it directly and so the more of the licks
[39:54] of fire the more because you see we've
[39:56] got a little piece of the pillar of fire
[39:57] in our own life amen and so when they
[40:01] come all together there's a stronger
[40:02] amen unity amen and such a unity that
[40:06] the devil can not even do anything
[40:08] against him such a power and unity amen
[40:12] and we've experienced there we've had
[40:14] great services where we've come into one
[40:17] mind and one accord and there's no other
[40:19] thoughts present and then he comes amen
[40:23] and lives change amen that's what it's
[40:26] all about it's about seeing people's
[40:29] lives changed it's about seeing people
[40:32] connect to God being part of it every
[40:35] one of us has got a part to play a
[40:37] Mainer so I'm not just preaching about
[40:40] you being here to receive your retirin
[40:42] faith but about you being here about you
[40:45] not just being attending a service
[40:47] either it's about being part of the
[40:49] vision it's a bigger picture this is not
[40:51] some sermon about how bad you are
[40:54] because you don't come to every service
[40:55] don't get me wrong let's look at the
[40:57] bigger picture here is a vision that the
[41:00] eternal God has opened up at the end
[41:02] time just before the rapture and all of
[41:05] that DNA of God they're very building
[41:07] blocks of his
[41:08] I divine nature as being ministered week
[41:11] after week in the prayer meetings and
[41:14] all of those things what's more
[41:15] important I ask you that there's your
[41:19] job more important are you just allowing
[41:22] your job tool to take you away from the
[41:24] services what's more important nothing I
[41:28] tell you in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:30] nothing's more important than being part
[41:32] of the vision amen hallelujah the
[41:35] rapture could happen any day are you
[41:36] ready
[41:37] hallelujah are you speaking things into
[41:39] existence if you're not speaking things
[41:41] into existence then you need to be here
[41:43] hallelujah amen
[41:46] praise the Lord I don't normally preach
[41:48] like this bit
[41:49] hallelujah does the Lord just inspires
[41:51] that so let's just accept that and
[41:54] embody it hallelujah amen hallelujah you
[41:59] see now the vision open nehemiah and
[42:03] here in the tight near mire is the
[42:06] king's cup bearer and i was looking at
[42:08] us and i was getting a bit happy about
[42:09] that i was thinking you know what that's
[42:12] a good place to be
[42:13] the king's cup bearer hallelujah fill my
[42:17] cup law amen I lift it up amen come and
[42:23] fill this thirsty heart of mine or
[42:25] however it goes you become the Kings cup
[42:28] bearer and the king is pouring his wine

[42:33] time and to you hallelujah - to a need
[42:36] to inebriates you hallelujah for the
[42:39] grapes give a good smell there any the
[42:41] revelation is really hallelujah the

[42:59] that is correct and as dry and as past
[43:04] restoration hallelujah amen as long as
[43:08] this a desire for God as long as there's
[43:11] a desire God can restore your wine skin
[43:14] so that you can handle the new wine so
[43:17] that you can handle that revelation so
[43:19] that you can handle that identity
[43:22] amen when the guard pulls that new one
[43:25] cuz you're the king's cup bearer when
[43:28] the guard pulls the new wine into you

[43:33] whinge
[43:33] a man you just get a bubble up amen
[43:36] it's gonna change the way you sink you
[43:38] know when someone in the world drinks a
[43:40] bottle of red wine they start talking
[43:42] different things start coming out that
[43:45] they wouldn't usually say I mean they
[43:47] start seeing things different they start
[43:49] perceiving things different they start
[43:51] if they drink enough of it they'll start
[43:53] hearing voices amen hallelujah and I
[43:55] tell you tonight that if you start
[43:57] drinking that wine that God has given
[43:59] you you become the king's cup Bearer

[44:04] going to start hearing voices they made
[44:05] you drink enough of it you're going to
[44:07] start saying things that you didn't
[44:08] usually say you're going to start
[44:10] lifting your hands and the service when
[44:11] you never used to do it hallelujah
[44:13] because you're getting excited about
[44:15] that revelation amen and you will start
[44:18] rising up my love fear one might come
[44:20] away a me rise above this humanistic
[44:23] thinking but you've got to take that
[44:25] line and when you start taking that
[44:27] whine what happens the vision because
[44:31] now you're the king's cup Bearer and the
[44:33] vision starts opening amen hallelujah
[44:36] and you see what is God doing he's
[44:39] taking this man and he's taking him back
[44:41] to Jerusalem because he wants his walls
[44:43] to be built amen and he knows that
[44:45] there's going to be a lot of enemies is
[44:47] going to be a Sanballat that comes to
[44:49] challenge him hallelujah but you see God
[44:52] had prepared a people God have prepared
[44:55] people that were ever to the vision but
[44:58] you know what in the face of death in
[44:59] the face of danger in the face of all
[45:01] aridity land mocking and everything
[45:03] they're not worried about that
[45:05] they've got a vision and they've got a
[45:06] purpose they want to rebuild their city
[45:09] amen and we have a captain today hey man
[45:12] that is ruinous wanting to rebuild our
[45:14] Jerusalem was wanting to rebuild our
[45:15] walls too so that we can be free so that
[45:18] we can rise in that complete dominion
[45:20] amen hallelujah I should take this off
[45:29] praise the Lord a people that are loyal
[45:36] a people that are loyal to the vision
[45:39] regardless now working amen
[45:42] there's no time to go and focus on other
[45:44] things no time to go back to Babylon and
[45:46] focus on what it was going on over there
[45:47] the politics and in these things than
[45:49] the old business and jobs they had a
[45:51] vision amen now I just want to put a
[45:55] balance here just don't think ok now
[45:56] let's just throw all our businesses away
[45:58] let's go do it
[45:58] let's just stay in church and have
[46:00] service seven days a week no there's a
[46:02] balance what is your desire what do you
[46:06] want and I want to put this in here just
[46:09] as a perspective if your desire is right
[46:13] now now this might not be practical and
[46:15] it probably won't actually happen well
[46:16] it may do it may happen just before the
[46:18] rapture happens you know but if your
[46:21] desire is right and your spirit is in
[46:24] the right gear and your you've got the
[46:26] right perspective of this vision and you
[46:29] can see how important it is for your
[46:31] well-being in the well-being of the
[46:32] people and the outreach in the whole
[46:34] vision together you would want to be in
[46:37] service Wednesday
[46:40] no matter how far you got to travel no
[46:42] matter how tired your kids are going to
[46:44] be you'll want to be a super swings day
[46:45] Friday Saturday Sunday probably Monday
[46:49] and have some other meeting on Tuesday
[46:51] then I had to be all super that's what
[46:53] you would want that's what you would
[46:54] desire because you realize how important
[46:56] this is now that might not be practical
[46:58] because we've been twined ourselves with
[47:00] so many things and we're so busy and
[47:02] we've got so much stuff to do because
[47:04] Babylon has got ahold of our schedule
[47:06] and it might not be or anything bad it's
[47:09] just Babylon has got ahold of our share
[47:11] - do you recognize that you realize that
[47:13] that has happened
[47:14] amen and now don't get me wrong this is
[47:18] I don't not saying let's do this I'm
[47:19] saying if your desire was right you
[47:21] would want them I know I would I
[47:23] actually want there but I know it's not
[47:25] going to happen and I can't actually do
[47:26] it because I've got so much stuff I got
[47:28] to do I'm so busy but you see this is
[47:31] what I'm what I'm trying to say is if
[47:33] you desire if you realize the importance
[47:38] of what we have and the bigger picture
[47:42] the vision we are Kings cup beers
[47:47] we have drunken the wireless stimulation
[47:51] we've hit revelation has made us see
[47:54] things and hear voices and become a
[47:56] little crazy to the world come on balls
[47:58] kami hallelujah we've been drinking this
[48:03] but you see what is it done you know see
[48:05] drunk people we make it them I sit on
[48:07] something or I'm gonna do it and they're
[48:09] going out of control a little bit
[48:10] hallelujah what about the King's wine
[48:13] amen when you drink that Kings wine you
[48:16] get so focused you get so desirous and
[48:19] so zealous for the vision a man that you
[48:22] don't want to think of these other
[48:23] things you just like let's partake of
[48:25] this when we come here let's make it the
[48:26] greatest service for our God amen let's
[48:30] cut let's pray for it whoa because
[48:33] what's happening what is going on and
[48:36] Stokes Valley of New Zealand
[48:38] what visitation has happened you read in
[48:42] the Bible of all these great visitations
[48:43] through the scriptures and this was no
[48:46] less or no more it's the same this is
[48:50] the same it may not end it's probably
[48:52] you know all you read these things in
[48:54] the scripture you think of this big
[48:55] grand thing and you see Rome and what
[48:57] they've done to it you go visit these
[48:58] places and these big cathedrals and they
[49:01] look so good and that that's just man's
[49:04] thinking of it but when it really
[49:06] happened it was just the simple thing
[49:08] and yet an eternal power hallelujah the
[49:13] Prophet talks about the unrolling of
[49:15] things that will never end we are in the
[49:18] midst of an event hallelujah of the
[49:22] unrolling of things that will never end
[49:25] eternity is unrolling before us we are
[49:29] partaking of the Tree of Life and that
[49:31] tree of life we're going to live forever
[49:33] hallelujah do you know what you're
[49:35] eating do you know what you're feeding
[49:37] on that's raising an identity in you
[49:40] hallelujah they mean Laurita God I'm
[49:46] drinking the wine right now I'm standing
[49:48] here voices I starting to see things
[49:50] that I didn't see before because I'm
[49:53] drinking the wine hey me hallelujah I'm
[49:56] to talk different than I normally talk
[49:57] Amen hallelujah because I'm drinking the
[50:00] wine
[50:01] it's making me Evan towards the vision
[50:04] as I'm speaking these things it's it's a
[50:06] it's heightening my perspective
[50:10] hallelujah because you don't throughout
[50:12] the day and this is the whole design of
[50:14] society is that the day would just make
[50:17] us so naturally thinking carnally minded
[50:20] worried about these things and got to
[50:23] fight this fight and that thing that
[50:24] depends on what sort of life you have
[50:26] and what job you've got but for a lot of
[50:28] us there's so many responsibilities and
[50:30] you know in a it's just like lay it all
[50:33] down it's lay it down because you see
[50:37] now you recognize the importance of this
[50:39] vision you recognize how ported us to be
[50:41] here so that we can partake at this so
[50:44] that we can add her like a fire amen and
[50:47] regardless of what sanballat you know
[50:49] what Sam Bellamy Sanballat means the
[50:53] enemy in secret he's the enemy and your
[50:57] secret and your secret faults he's that
[51:00] enemy they're boys that comes in to try
[51:03] and tell you this is wrong and that and
[51:04] this would make you critical and
[51:05] whatever it made them and mop you and
[51:07] make you fear and all those things Sam
[51:11] Bell it come in there to try and place
[51:13] fear on to try and cast out try and make
[51:17] you doubt the things that God is doing
[51:19] don't doubt don't fear as I just posted
[51:23] the sir I miss it's a little quote that
[51:25] I thought was so good pray for big
[51:28] things that's big don't just try it okay
[51:32] now let's just make this a bit small
[51:33] because go on mind if I ask too big he
[51:35] might say no you're being greedy a man
[51:37] God says ask abundantly that your Joy's
[51:39] may befall he wants you to have a
[51:41] prosperous life he wants to you to live
[51:44] in a spiritual prosperity but he also
[51:46] wants you to physically prosper he wants
[51:48] you to be a king amen
[51:50] now your attitude towards all these
[51:52] things will determine how much he gives
[51:54] you because if it's going to make you
[51:56] fall and it's going to make you proud if
[51:57] it's going to make you arrogant then you
[51:59] won't get much probably because he knows
[52:01] how to administer to you what you need
[52:03] based on your character based on what
[52:04] you can handle but
[52:08] you find yourself in such a situation
[52:10] that's big
[52:12] don't ask small at least you want
[52:14] something smaller force you just ask
[52:16] what you need but you see when it comes
[52:18] to the vision of the Lord when it comes
[52:20] to something you see as so impossible
[52:23] amen let me just read this before I go
[52:25] any further near him I have four one two
[52:28] six let's get this drink some wine who's
[52:30] ready who's ready to drink some wine
[52:32] amen but it came to pass that when
[52:35] sanballat heard that we builded the wall
[52:38] he was wroth which means angry and took
[52:42] great indignation and mopped the Jews
[52:45] and spake before his brethren and the
[52:47] army of Samaria and said what do these
[52:50] feeble Jews well they fortify themselves
[52:55] well they actually build themselves up
[52:57] that's what Satan's asking you will you
[53:00] can you do it will you access your
[53:03] inheritance and he's gonna do everything
[53:06] he can to try and push you down to try
[53:08] and make you sick Carolee agreeing with
[53:14] all that all the voices that's going on
[53:15] inside here same Belet inside a secret
[53:19] enemy enemy in and your secret faults o
[53:23] God purge thou me from my secret vaults
[53:27] that's what David prayed you know he hid
[53:30] revelation he knew some things he knew
[53:33] that there was stuff going on inside his
[53:35] mind and in a spirit there he couldn't
[53:37] get rid of he didn't even know they were
[53:38] there but they were holding him back
[53:39] there were things that was holding him
[53:41] back he said Lord cleanse me and that's
[53:46] what you'd be praying every day Oh God
[53:47] Oh Lord your mercy cleanse me Oh what
[53:52] the I don't want the voice of Sanballat
[53:54] to rule my life because he's a mocker
[53:58] and he's going to he's going to talk
[54:01] he's gonna torment you if he can and
[54:04] he's going to hold you back if he came
[54:06] because gonna question everything that
[54:07] God's promised you will you fortify
[54:10] yourself he says can you God says yes
[54:14] you can you are it's what you're doing
[54:16] here you're being fortified embody the
[54:20] word embody the word
[54:22] become one with it hallelujah yield to
[54:27] the spirit that are speaking behind that
[54:30] word elahh lujah will they sacrifice a
[54:35] me will your life your lips be a sweet
[54:39] sacrifice unto the Lord will you be able
[54:43] I ask me now not same bellick now well
[54:47] can you can you can you lay your life
[54:51] down as a living sacrifice upon the
[54:55] altar Alleluia can you have your own
[55:00] Gethsemane experience hallelujah
[55:04] where your world becomes none null and
[55:07] void and whose will becomes king Amen so
[55:11] that he can rebuild your Jerusalem
[55:12] because until you make David King
[55:15] there's no Jerusalem being built it's
[55:17] gonna lay in ruins
[55:18] that's the real part of you it's the
[55:21] stuff that really needs to be dealt with
[55:23] that's the that's your identity so that
[55:27] you can recognize your queenship so that
[55:29] you can recognize who you truly are
[55:31] your eternal being your eternal identity
[55:34] you will never see it until you are real
[55:37] willing to lay your life on that altar
[55:39] really not just say it not just
[55:42] religiously thing it really and
[55:45] everything everything will they make an
[55:51] end of the day will they revive the
[55:54] stones out of the heaps of the rubbish
[55:55] which a bird amen hallelujah you are
[55:58] living stones amen
[56:00] but you see in this particular context
[56:03] and it can be probably preached in other
[56:04] way but you see in this kintu versus the
[56:07] stones of your confession this is the
[56:09] stones of your revelation and what your
[56:12] confession becomes and what you speak in
[56:14] what you say you become to believe what
[56:17] you sing out in your life hallelujah so
[56:20] he's given you a new song will that be
[56:22] revived hallelujah would they be a group
[56:25] that has swollen from a vision
[56:27] sambel a task will they revive that in a
[56:32] mocking way he wasn't asking it
[56:33] sincerely he didn't believe it could
[56:35] happen
[56:36] he didn't believe that all these stones
[56:38] that have been later ruined
[56:40] hallelujah he didn't believe that they
[56:42] could be rebuilt because they were all
[56:44] laying under the dirt of Babylon and you
[56:47] see sometimes the enemy can come into a
[56:50] place come into a fellowship coming to
[56:53] your own life as an individual
[56:54] come into a nation and turn that nation
[56:57] into a bunch of stones that instead of
[56:58] becoming a real temple becoming a wall
[57:01] they just a layer a rubble in the
[57:03] rubbish and their confession has become
[57:06] a fight it's become a politics has
[57:08] become a complaint
[57:09] hallelujah it's exactly what happens and
[57:14] what can hit them and what has hit them
[57:15] but I tell you whoa he revived the
[57:19] stones yes the stones are being revived
[57:22] hallelujah it is the Loews doing it is
[57:24] marvelous in our eyes
[57:26] it is not our doing God is reviving
[57:28] those stones God has made a vision God
[57:31] has given us a vision hallelujah and now
[57:33] by Everett Lee following their vision
[57:35] and giving our all to this vision and
[57:37] praying into this vision and speaking
[57:38] into this vision through the stones of
[57:41] your confession you're speaking the
[57:45] vision you're speaking this vision
[57:48] you're the revival of your confession
[57:52] has been raised up from a Babylonian
[57:54] rule from a judgment of where it was all
[57:59] taken away can it be restored yes I say
[58:02] it can be restored hallelujah you're
[58:05] looking at one we're a part of one
[58:08] restoration for this this place
[58:11] Wellington was exactly what Sanballat
[58:13] was looking at Sanballat had got the
[58:16] better of this region and it was a it
[58:18] was a known thing that Wellington was
[58:20] gone
[58:21] most people that walked in this message
[58:24] near before anything could happen
[58:27] it won't never even considered it
[58:31] Sanballat was asking the question this
[58:33] question was looming and it was it was
[58:35] looming over the valley of Wellington
[58:39] will these stones be revived
[58:42] and there was there was a potential
[58:44] there there was a life hallelujah and
[58:47] even though that life had been concreted
[58:50] over by Babylonia concrete and man and
[58:53] ruin and all sorts of other things and
[58:55] species all of hallelujah

[59:03] in this region Amen God God had what hit
[59:09] him a hit a man come here became a Kings
[59:14] capira a man started drinking the wine
[59:17] amen hallelujah amen you know one of the
[59:20] very revelations that this church was
[59:22] found at all was that we needed a wine
[59:25] skin that was supple you they could they
[59:29] could hold the wine hallelujah Amen so
[59:32] now we're talking about a congregation
[59:35] here not just an individual but a people
[59:37] they had a vision there was they were
[59:40] free to receive the wine it was supple
[59:45] that had a wine skin that could handle
[59:48] the new wine that was being poured out
[59:50] at the evening time hallelujah because
[59:52] that Jesus amen he saved the best wine
[59:55] to last amen and you see these stones

[1:00:11] of God's testimony the testimony of
[1:00:13] Jesus the spirit of prophecy starts to
[1:00:16] resound over these hills and the blood
[1:00:18] of Jesus Christ that's to flow down to
[1:00:20] the lowest Valley hallelujah amen to see
[1:00:25] some stones a confession alive a
[1:00:28] profession be restored to come to live
[1:00:32] again that these stones would rise up
[1:00:34] again hallelujah in form the walls of
[1:00:38] Jerusalem again hallelujah and we are
[1:00:40] all beneficiaries what's more important
[1:00:45] is there anything in your life that you
[1:00:49] have in your schedule any family member
[1:00:53] anything now let's be practical here
[1:00:56] I'm just asking the question is there
[1:00:58] anything more important amen
[1:01:02] no there isn't there is nothing more
[1:01:06] important hallelujah
[1:01:09] you know we look back to 1965 and we see
[1:01:12] the sunset mountain sword landing in the
[1:01:16] prophets hand and we see how that was
[1:01:18] the the first time that the word the
[1:01:22] eternal word creative power
[1:01:24] it'll hand it in the hands of a mortal
[1:01:26] man marking a great a momentous moment
[1:01:30] and history this had never happened
[1:01:34] before we look at that and say let's
[1:01:38] amaze and you and it gives you this
[1:01:40] celestial feeling and inebriates you
[1:01:44] think about well because there's one now
[1:01:50] don't make that any more important than
[1:01:53] what is happening tonight
[1:01:54] I'm telling you know maybe that might be
[1:01:55] a big statement and what does not just
[1:01:57] happening tonight but what is happening
[1:01:59] in a most who is here what is being
[1:02:04] placed in your hands why are you going
[1:02:08] through trials why why is all of those
[1:02:11] things in your life being exposed
[1:02:13] because God is gonna get rid of them so
[1:02:16] that he can put that sword in your hand
[1:02:17] as well
[1:02:18] booyah he's put it in your heart that
[1:02:20] you just don't have the access to it and
[1:02:22] fullness you because you don't have the
[1:02:23] character if brother Brandon finally is
[1:02:27] the son of the the son of men revealing
[1:02:33] the son of men a son of man revealing B
[1:02:35] son of man a son of man standing there
[1:02:38] finally after all those hardships all
[1:02:40] those trials all of that stuff that he
[1:02:41] had to go through to make him ready to
[1:02:46] receive that there's a great time in
[1:02:48] history it's a great moment for Humanity
[1:02:51] it shows that the grace of God could
[1:02:54] redeem a man that God could entrust
[1:02:56] creative power - that was so surrendered
[1:02:58] to his will that was so did to his own
[1:03:01] ambitions had gone through some extreme
[1:03:04] trials extreme hardship to bring a word
[1:03:07] to you that's cleansing and sanctifying
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:10] and we want to miss service and we want
[1:03:12] to stay home we want to make our
[1:03:13] children more comfortable what's more
[1:03:15] important hallelujah making your
[1:03:17] children comfortable or part of the
[1:03:19] vision some people probably don't even
[1:03:21] watch these wings day night services
[1:03:23] shame on them shame on you hallelujah
[1:03:29] it's a shame they're probably watching
[1:03:31] some other things some other Minister
[1:03:33] following the envision now there's
[1:03:35] nothing wrong with following other
[1:03:36] ministries don't get me wrong but what's
[1:03:39] more important your local vision we're
[1:03:42] God's feeding you or some ministry some
[1:03:47] other place where God's feeding that
[1:03:48] church we're blessed to have the
[1:03:51] Ministry of all of these different
[1:03:52] things and people to have such a balance
[1:03:54] and here the fivefold ministry but if
[1:03:58] God is pouring out his wine locally now
[1:04:01] some people don't have this some people
[1:04:04] don't have the wine pouring out locally
[1:04:09] and you know it's very hard but I asked
[1:04:13] the AIA who if they listening to this I
[1:04:15] asked the same question who those stones
[1:04:19] that are laying in that condition be
[1:04:22] revived and I say yes I say God is doing
[1:04:25] the rounds of this nation I say God is
[1:04:28] doing the rounds of this nation
[1:04:29] hallelujah look open your eyes and see
[1:04:33] the events that are taking place amen
[1:04:35] for modern events are made clear by
[1:04:37] prophecy and what are we doing tonight
[1:04:39] Nehemiah we're looking at prophecy
[1:04:42] that's making the modern events of today
[1:04:44] clear because every story in the Bible
[1:04:48] was a prophecy as well hallelujah we're
[1:04:51] looking at a vision in the word my
[1:04:54] goodness I'm probably going to regret
[1:04:58] saying all these things later when when
[1:05:00] this inspiration kind of when the wine
[1:05:03] wears off a little bit but praise the
[1:05:05] Lord anyway hallelujah amen you know
[1:05:08] sometimes the truth hurts there's
[1:05:17] nothing more important Alleluia I mean
[1:05:20] just continue
[1:05:23] will they revive the stones out of the
[1:05:25] heaps of the rubbish which a bhoot yes
[1:05:27] they will if they are stay with the
[1:05:28] vision yes they will as they don't get
[1:05:30] distracted yes they will if they stop
[1:05:32] looking at other things all the time and
[1:05:34] put this vision first over here Alleluia
[1:05:38] put God first in your local area get
[1:05:42] that into perspective
[1:05:43] Haim it might not seem like much might
[1:05:48] not look like much when you compare it
[1:05:50] to the glorious giant misses churches
[1:05:52] all over the world with pastors that
[1:05:53] have been preaching for 50 years and
[1:05:55] have such wonderful ministries watch
[1:05:57] them but this was first for you because
[1:06:01] this is the same God that's speaking
[1:06:03] through them as speaking here and this
[1:06:06] revelation here is specifically for the
[1:06:09] people the stones that are part of this
[1:06:11] part of the wall it's true this part of
[1:06:15] the wall amen is a watchtower in
[1:06:19] different it regions and he's a
[1:06:20] watchtower here for us amen we're just
[1:06:23] part of the wall you know we're not the
[1:06:24] whole wall we're just one of the peoples
[1:06:26] on the beach I'm just NSB and says you
[1:06:28] know we don't think we're the only
[1:06:29] people on the beach but we're very happy
[1:06:31] to be on the beach amen we're happy to
[1:06:34] be part of something that's real amen
[1:06:36] so let's you know and it's focus our
[1:06:39] attention because if we don't there's a
[1:06:43] problem you can have you can actually
[1:06:44] start to have trouble and there are
[1:06:47] people in the Bible with car was doing
[1:06:49] amazing things and there was a vision
[1:06:51] moving and there was activity spiritual
[1:06:53] activity in God dealing directly in
[1:06:55] moving the people and those that kind of
[1:06:58] looked and weren't fully evident
[1:07:01] watching and focused putting their
[1:07:04] worship and energy into God that's
[1:07:06] moving locally in their own vision they
[1:07:09] start to think about other things they
[1:07:10] start to form little kemp's I start to
[1:07:13] get a bit sidetracked by Cora we'll go a
[1:07:20] little bit later now tobiah the ammonite
[1:07:23] was by him and he said even that which
[1:07:25] they build if a fox go up shall even
[1:07:29] break the arm a stone wall he wants to
[1:07:35] make you feel like this is
[1:07:36] that much is not really able people here
[1:07:40] that are part of an avid vision that can
[1:07:42] see it they have a perspective that has
[1:07:45] been tuned and they're tuned in so that
[1:07:49] when that pillar of fire comes up and
[1:07:51] wants the moon watch that's focused they
[1:07:56] are they're receiving the DNA of God
[1:07:59] they're receiving that revelation as its
[1:08:03] unfolding it's kept moving because the
[1:08:05] pillar of fire is moving this is all
[1:08:06] spiritually speaking now we're not in
[1:08:08] the wilderness and moving like this and
[1:08:10] there but we still will live by a pillar
[1:08:12] of fire and the pillar of fire is moving
[1:08:14] us he's turning a corner and he's
[1:08:17] building up to the pinnacle of the of
[1:08:19] the great temple of God right now now we
[1:08:24] want to be part of this we want to we
[1:08:26] don't want to be like I said earlier
[1:08:28] coming to church and catching up okay
[1:08:30] I'll that's what he was preaching on I
[1:08:31] tell you I better watch that now and you
[1:08:32] go back you know you want to be part of
[1:08:35] it live you know and maybe it's not
[1:08:38] practical real time but we've got a live
[1:08:39] stream there's a live stream there shame
[1:08:44] on those that aren't part of the live
[1:08:45] stream that are part of this church that
[1:08:47] are going on watching something else or
[1:08:48] at the rugby or something like that
[1:08:49] because that's more important than God I
[1:08:52] know that sounds hard but that's exactly
[1:08:55] what their life was saying that's what
[1:08:57] lives are say if rugby comes before
[1:09:01] church that the people will go to rugby
[1:09:04] or they'll have a rag me mind when
[1:09:08] churches on or there's a plan okay we
[1:09:11] won't go to church because these are
[1:09:12] ugly this thing nothing is more
[1:09:14] important and part of this vision you
[1:09:21] see we're streaming now that's there so
[1:09:25] that we can all partake live with part
[1:09:27] of this vision because someone's is not
[1:09:30] practical to drive so long and you know
[1:09:32] sometimes you just can't
[1:09:33] there's sicknesses and everything but we
[1:09:35] can buy the technology that's available
[1:09:36] it's a tree of good and evil so let's
[1:09:39] just use some of that good and it's now
[1:09:42] always be partaking of this manner
[1:09:45] always be partly see is more than mana
[1:09:47] now that's actually patched corn we're
[1:09:50] in the
[1:09:50] and we're feasting on the on the body
[1:09:52] word of the Son of Man
[1:09:53] we're feasting on the grain the golden
[1:09:55] green hero our God for we are despised
[1:10:03] and turn their reproach upon their head
[1:10:06] now this is now near my praying and give
[1:10:09] them for a pray in the land of captivity
[1:10:11] and cover not their iniquity and let not
[1:10:13] their sin be blotted out from before
[1:10:14] thee for they have provoked me to anger
[1:10:17] before the builders and here's the key
[1:10:20] now and this is what really when being
[1:10:23] read this on Sunday this is really what
[1:10:25] really struck me and you know when I
[1:10:28] didn't know what I was preaching on
[1:10:29] until last night and I prayed and asked
[1:10:30] Lord and that's what he brought this to
[1:10:32] me so built we the wall and all the wall
[1:10:35] was joined together and to the half
[1:10:37] thereof for the people head of mind to
[1:10:40] work
[1:10:41] hallelujah and I pray that God gives you
[1:10:44] a mind to work gives you a mind you know
[1:10:49] that weird mind as it's a heart that
[1:10:52] your heart is part of this vision not
[1:10:56] now because mind and the Old Testament
[1:10:57] is meaning the heart but let me just say
[1:11:00] what mine to us you know then to lecture
[1:11:02] you might have an intellectual mind to
[1:11:04] work you might think oh yes this is all
[1:11:06] this is a good idea and no no no but
[1:11:08] your heart's not really in it your
[1:11:10] hearts and the rugby your hearts and the
[1:11:12] cultural fabrics of your own nature
[1:11:16] that's got to die those things have got
[1:11:19] to die your will has to die because it's
[1:11:23] not more important than God there is a
[1:11:26] powerful vision forming and it's not
[1:11:29] getting any less it's becoming more and
[1:11:32] more and more the wine is becoming
[1:11:34] stronger and stronger and stronger the
[1:11:37] vintage is becoming sweeter and sweeter
[1:11:38] and sweeter and it's going to have a
[1:11:40] greater and greater and greater effect
[1:11:42] as the vintage becomes mature because
[1:11:47] those grapes just become more mature as
[1:11:49] they bottle and you are that bottle and
[1:11:51] inside you is the wine that is becoming
[1:11:53] stronger and stronger and stronger
[1:11:55] hallelujah amen to be raised up into
[1:12:01] that vision
[1:12:03] to give you a mind to work and
[1:12:05] intellectual mind not just a heart that
[1:12:10] your heart is in this and if it's not
[1:12:13] ask the Lord
[1:12:14] Celie even tonight and whoever's
[1:12:17] watching if you're watching it now or
[1:12:19] live or later pray now Claud give me a
[1:12:25] heart for this vision let me see it's
[1:12:28] reality
[1:12:29] let me see its importance because this
[1:12:32] is not just another thing that was
[1:12:33] happening and you know we just make this
[1:12:35] church and it's nice and we're going to
[1:12:36] get numbers and whatnot this is the
[1:12:38] gathering of the bride this is the
[1:12:40] gathering of an eternal people that have
[1:12:43] been stuck in bed alone they're been all
[1:12:46] these stones down into walls and they've
[1:12:48] been covered over by dirt this is the
[1:12:51] revival of the stones this is a revival
[1:12:53] of a testimony Amen hallelujah baby we
[1:12:57] can go for every type in the Bible and
[1:12:59] show you exactly what I'm talking about
[1:13:00] and I'm sure that you recognize these
[1:13:03] things but maybe it's just in your mind
[1:13:08] let this now who you pray Lord make it
[1:13:12] might let my heart be involved in this
[1:13:14] more I don't just want to give my mind
[1:13:18] or my body to this I want to give my
[1:13:20] heart my whole being to this to the
[1:13:24] vision of the Lord to be excited about
[1:13:27] it
[1:13:27] to see the celestial value of this
[1:13:32] vision because it's not this is not some
[1:13:35] agenda of man or some light thing this
[1:13:40] is this is a great thing and this is
[1:13:43] being done in trouble sometimes there is
[1:13:46] a restoration and trouble sometimes this
[1:13:49] is a troublesome time the devil's
[1:13:51] trained all of hell on you Sam Bela is
[1:13:55] mocking you
[1:13:56] and he's querying everything that you
[1:13:59] see to do and here's the very nail of
[1:14:05] this whole thing if your whole heart is
[1:14:08] not involved in this you will be swayed
[1:14:13] by sin
[1:14:14] you will be swayed and you will remain
[1:14:18] an uneffective stone yes people will
[1:14:21] enjoy it when you come and they'll say
[1:14:24] hello and good you're here and they
[1:14:31] stayed with me hey Maya they stayed with
[1:14:33] the vision they stay there even though
[1:14:35] they had to walk they were working and
[1:14:37] they were fighting and they had the
[1:14:39] sword in the shovel in their hands and
[1:14:41] they were working they had a mind to
[1:14:43] work I'll just replace mine with heart
[1:14:46] because that's what the artist was they
[1:14:47] had a heart to the vision the heart they
[1:14:50] loved it they had enough a gapper loved
[1:14:55] for it and a figlio love for it amen
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:02] hallelujah I pray before my heart that
[1:15:05] this will bless the vision amen I mean I
[1:15:10] have only passed the first stage but
[1:15:13] that's alright whatever the Lord wants
[1:15:15] we just just just you just let him speak
[1:15:20] let's go to as I 51 verse 19
[1:15:37] awake awake put on strength of the Lord
[1:15:44] hello I'm of the Lord hello branch Jesus
[1:15:50] says I am the vine you are the branches
[1:15:53] who was Jesus he's the tree of life what
[1:15:58] are you
[1:15:58] you are the branch of the Tree of Life
[1:16:01] why because you are avidly heartfelt
[1:16:07] idli part of this vision and to be part
[1:16:11] of the Tree of Life unit you you are and
[1:16:13] grafted into the vision of God not just
[1:16:16] in your minds people can put themselves
[1:16:18] in the vision in their mind but until
[1:16:20] they have a gift cemani and so they lay
[1:16:22] it down and go you you know you give
[1:16:23] everything to know where nothing becomes
[1:16:27] more important than you being part of
[1:16:29] this you know really really everyone
[1:16:32] should be here really this was and
[1:16:35] sometimes it's not practical but if
[1:16:36] people only realize how important it is
[1:16:39] you know and and geography there's it's
[1:16:43] got nothing to do with it and I know it
[1:16:45] sound this probably sounds very sweet
[1:16:47] because I any love five minutes away but
[1:16:49] if I love two hours away I would be here
[1:16:51] every service and that's just me and
[1:16:54] there's nothing more important to me
[1:16:56] than being in the service and not just
[1:16:59] for my own benefit because I'm blessed
[1:17:02] every night by God I have a good prayer
[1:17:04] life and all of those things but it's
[1:17:07] about given that's about partaking it's
[1:17:10] about moving how many swords are being
[1:17:13] held hallelujah how many shuttles are
[1:17:17] being held who's put their hand to the
[1:17:19] plow amen
[1:17:21] and who's still looking back you know
[1:17:25] what it's he says you're not fit to be
[1:17:27] my disciple it word fitters not
[1:17:30] appropriate not meet meet for the
[1:17:34] Masters use this is gonna sound really
[1:17:38] bad but see me useless to the Lord
[1:17:42] because he wants people that
[1:17:44] rely on reliable people wholesome always
[1:17:49] not casual about it not taking advantage
[1:17:54] of the Liberty cuz you know you can do
[1:17:56] what if you like and this is not the
[1:17:59] type of church that's gonna condemn
[1:18:00] anybody or you know have a deacon
[1:18:02] meeting with people because they don't
[1:18:03] attend this and that it's all in your
[1:18:04] own well but you know sometimes the Lord
[1:18:07] wants has and I prayed this with all my
[1:18:10] heart and and I felt that this is I said
[1:18:14] Lord let your heart be revealed tonight
[1:18:17] and so I'm just I'm only this is nothing
[1:18:21] that a lot of us stuff is not in my
[1:18:22] notes especially that heavy stuff it's
[1:18:25] not in my notes I'm just you know the
[1:18:28] Lord the thought comes you don't just
[1:18:30] turn the Lord down you speak what he
[1:18:32] says and so I speak it and then the next
[1:18:36] Lord's waiting and then I speak it and
[1:18:38] it's following the bane of this thought
[1:18:41] but the Lord's actually doing the
[1:18:43] speaking and I know it's probably
[1:18:45] doesn't make sense to everybody but if
[1:18:46] you're a minister you understand when
[1:18:48] you're under the inspiration that's how
[1:18:50] it works I guess for most of the path
[1:19:04] so here we're reading in Isaiah chapter
[1:19:06] 51 the importance now of our this hammer
[1:19:12] the Lord this tree of life you're the
[1:19:14] branch what happens on the branches is
[1:19:16] the fruit that's where the fruit is born
[1:19:18] now the fruit that they you see brother
[1:19:22] Branham says that if there's not enough
[1:19:23] water going in those leaves get turned
[1:19:26] into prickles and you become a cactus
[1:19:28] you don't want to be a cactus for the
[1:19:30] Lord will be under that order of God
[1:19:34] moist
[1:19:36] the leaves are wrong and they
[1:19:39] photosynthesize what the line of the Son
[1:19:42] of Man the light of the Son of Man that
[1:19:44] is shining a man in this last end date
[1:19:47] that mighty angel that's come down with
[1:19:50] a face shining like the Sun personal
[1:19:55] revelation to you
[1:19:56] amen now when you're part of the vision
[1:20:01] and your effort Lee in your hearts in it
[1:20:02] you're you are immersed in the vision
[1:20:06] you're immersed in the water that is
[1:20:09] being poured out a fountain that's
[1:20:11] opened in the house of David right here
[1:20:14] for you so this is Alves this is ours
[1:20:19] you know this is an amazing glorious

[1:25:28] deep you know that if you look at Luke
[1:25:31] actually he you know we build the life
[1:25:32] on the rock we always think okay the
[1:25:34] rock at them and the children's books
[1:25:36] have the man finding the rock and
[1:25:37] building his life on it but
[1:25:39] Jesus didn't say that Jesus actually
[1:25:41] said that you to find the rock you've
[1:25:44] got to dig through the sand the sands
[1:25:46] there first you've got to dig through it
[1:25:49] and find the rock you know he says I
[1:25:53] like in a wise man who dig deep
[1:25:58] hallelujah you got to dig down through
[1:26:00] all of those the muck right dig down

[1:26:11] all of the sand and all of the mud and
[1:26:13] muck of your old nature and your old
[1:26:15] desires in your old plans and what was
[1:26:17] used to be important to you and there
[1:26:20] are things are now us that we are still
[1:26:22] holding over and pulled more importance
[1:26:24] because when they come up we're not a
[1:26:26] church when they come up we can't be
[1:26:28] there or I've got to do this little
[1:26:30] assignment or I've got this project on
[1:26:32] nothing's more important nothing
[1:26:34] shame on those that put anything in
[1:26:36] front of the vision of the Lord
[1:26:38] Jamie because they needed deeper so that
[1:26:46] their life can be it's completely
[1:26:48] founded on the rock you've got to dig
[1:26:51] down through all the sand and pot but
[1:26:53] your house be built on that rock that
[1:26:57] cannot be swayed by any storm you know
[1:27:00] it will wither everything that decision
[1:27:03] that you make hallelujah that death that
[1:27:07] happens to yourself and all those things
[1:27:10] hallelujah so that you can be pilot
[1:27:13] vision that risk is right here that part
[1:27:15] cease to see people saved amen to see
[1:27:19] people's lives change because you see
[1:27:21] God will change nations to find his
[1:27:24] bride God will change governments he
[1:27:26] will do all sorts of things he will
[1:27:28] completely move things what and we will
[1:27:30] it happen through you through those that
[1:27:33] are evidently part of the vision you're
[1:27:36] an unstoppable force when you're part of
[1:27:39] the vision in that way and then if
[1:27:41] you're not in that way
[1:27:42] when I say you us as a people together
[1:27:46] in unity that have a heart for this
[1:27:48] vision that a part of it that are here
[1:27:51] all the time
[1:27:52] that are faithful but a loyal that have
[1:27:55] a revelation of the importance of this
[1:27:57] eternal unfolding right now that is
[1:28:01] happening here this fountain open we're
[1:28:06] unstoppable and invincible army
[1:28:09] hallelujah
[1:28:24] because there are a lot of hard cases
[1:28:28] out there then they've got their name
[1:28:30] written on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:28:32] they've been bound down by Babylon and
[1:28:35] he's saying to you into I and to those
[1:28:38] that are still got that those that have
[1:28:39] got their hand on the plow and are
[1:28:41] looking back they might not say it but
[1:28:43] it's shown in the life and this is just
[1:28:45] all of us have a measure of
[1:28:47] accountability here I'm not just
[1:28:50] preaching to individuals certain
[1:28:51] individuals it's all of us we all have
[1:28:53] to don't pitchfork this this is for all
[1:28:56] of us for me too and we search our lives
[1:29:00] have I got my hand to the plow and am I
[1:29:03] looking back cuz this is this is an
[1:29:06] awakening time awaken and put on
[1:29:09] strength and virtue to your faith
[1:29:13] because you see if there's no virtue in
[1:29:17] there when someone comes to you for help
[1:29:20] or for deliverance it says insufficient
[1:29:23] funds because you're receiving the DNA
[1:29:31] every week every service you're here
[1:29:33] you'll pray it up you've prayed for it
[1:29:35] you know I'm preaching you topic
[1:29:36] condition I'm not preaching that this is
[1:29:38] going to be every time everywhere where
[1:29:39] there's perfect people it doesn't happen
[1:29:41] that way but your desires you've you're
[1:29:44] geared towards that and you're making
[1:29:46] moves in your life to cater for that and
[1:29:49] eventually it will become that because
[1:29:51] you see we're moving into that and we're
[1:29:53] drinking the wine that is changing our
[1:29:55] thinking that's making us see visions
[1:29:59] it's making us speak that's allowing the
[1:30:02] operation of God to operate in our midst
[1:30:05] because there's a harmony there's a
[1:30:07] unity there's a place there's an
[1:30:08] atmosphere where God feels welcome
[1:30:10] hallelujah
[1:30:11] there's a Liberty but don't take
[1:30:14] advantage of the Liberty Amen Alleluia
[1:30:19] very much further get out the musicians
[1:30:41] season as Exodus 40s and here aired up
[1:30:44] the court round about the tabernacle and
[1:30:46] the altar and set up the hanging of the
[1:30:48] court gate
[1:30:49] so Moses finished the work then a cloud
[1:30:51] covered the tent of the congregation and
[1:30:53] the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:30:54] tabernacle of Moses was not able to
[1:30:55] enter into the tent of the congregation
[1:30:57] because the cloud abode thereon and the
[1:31:00] glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle
[1:31:01] and when the cloud was taken up from
[1:31:03] over the tabernacle the children of
[1:31:05] Israel went onwards and all their
[1:31:06] journeys but if the cloud were not taken
[1:31:09] up then they journeyed not till the day
[1:31:11] that it was taken up for the cloud of
[1:31:13] the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day
[1:31:14] and the fire was on it by night hello
[1:31:17] children of the evening time
[1:31:19] hello louia what are we being led by the
[1:31:22] pillar of fire are you focused on that
[1:31:24] can you see when it's moving and you
[1:31:26] churned into it or are you looking back
[1:31:29] hallelujah because if you're looking
[1:31:32] back you're not tuned in to that pillar
[1:31:34] fire and he's moving and he's got a
[1:31:35] little plane over here and he wants to
[1:31:37] do this and he wants to deliver that but
[1:31:40] we're playing catch-up playing catch-up
[1:31:43] because we you know and there's nothing
[1:31:46] wrong like I said was looking at all the
[1:31:47] other ministries but have you first and
[1:31:51] foremost as your heart completely part
[1:31:54] of this vision have you fed from the
[1:31:57] local resource the local resource of the
[1:32:02] fountain that is being poured out that's
[1:32:05] first
[1:32:05] then going to your heart's content and
[1:32:09] thus this I believe is not just me
[1:32:13] saying this you need to have that right
[1:32:16] perspective it must be there because
[1:32:19] this isn't these aren't yes they are
[1:32:21] sermons and and all that but there's
[1:32:23] more to it than that it's we're too far
[1:32:27] along in the day I don't know if I've
[1:32:31] preached on this before and it's kind of
[1:32:33] in the same context but you see now the
[1:32:37] age is matured it's gone from it's moved
[1:32:41] up from the Eagle Age where where the
[1:32:46] Prophet could see and raise us up and we
[1:32:49] would fly up with them and see for miles
[1:32:52] it's moved into the full mind
[1:32:55] crossed the age brother branham called
[1:32:57] it the age of the intelligence what is
[1:33:00] that fullness of Christ in the body that
[1:33:04] is not a sermon anymore for your new to
[1:33:07] enjoy just there has become flesh that
[1:33:11] and whereas it manifested it has
[1:33:14] manifested in the talents that every
[1:33:18] single one of us have and each one of us
[1:33:21] have a calling in our life each one of
[1:33:24] us have talents now if that talent is
[1:33:27] completely yielded to the vision that
[1:33:30] you're connected to it will embody their
[1:33:34] intelligence please just think and
[1:33:36] really absorb this it's then there for
[1:33:43] the very fullness of Christ operating
[1:33:46] through the ministry
[1:33:47] it's then there for the very fullness of
[1:33:51] Christ operating in the gift of mother
[1:33:53] and the gift of father and the gift of
[1:33:56] deacon and the gift of song leader and
[1:33:58] the gift of all the gifts part of the
[1:34:02] body if we can just completely give
[1:34:06] ourselves today and yield and take our
[1:34:09] own ambitions because we can diagnose
[1:34:11] situations and admit it could be very
[1:34:13] well thought of that I'm diagnosing the
[1:34:17] situation of our congregation and that's
[1:34:20] the hardest part about preaching in your
[1:34:22] own church you know what's going on but
[1:34:26] you have to get yourself out of the way
[1:34:27] we have to receive these things and
[1:34:30] believe that all those years that people
[1:34:35] preached about the intelligence and how
[1:34:37] will the mind of Christ and the people
[1:34:39] one day just one day it has to happen
[1:34:43] and it's happening now the the the
[1:34:48] pastoral gifts have come to a higher
[1:34:51] level of postural maturity and love
[1:34:54] because why they're all their ambition
[1:34:57] and all of their there's all God and
[1:34:59] it's Christ now and that gift operating
[1:35:02] in the fullness and that's why it's so
[1:35:05] important
[1:35:07] that we yield our talents to this vision
[1:35:12] because this is the vision that Christ
[1:35:14] has opened and then we will move and we
[1:35:19] will see the pillar of fire will be
[1:35:23] tuned in what's a good song we could
[1:35:28] sing it's kind of along these lines we
[1:35:42] need to stick with you know the
[1:35:44] Israelites needed to stick with Moses
[1:35:46] they needed to stick with Joshua they
[1:35:50] needed to stick with the captain of the
[1:35:51] hosts they needed to stick with these
[1:35:53] people just play something I'm just
[1:35:59] gonna read this quote this is the story
[1:36:04] of Gabe who knows the story of Gabe and
[1:36:07] the message that's when I read it here
[1:36:09] there was an old down there in the
[1:36:11] south and his pastor I knew him a nice
[1:36:13] old fellow
[1:36:14] we called him Gabe his name was Gabriel
[1:36:17] but we just called him Gabe he always
[1:36:18] passed her and I we we went hunting a
[1:36:21] whole lot and he was an old colored
[1:36:23] brother and we went out hunting and so
[1:36:26] old Gabe like to hunt better than
[1:36:28] anybody I ever knew but he was a poor
[1:36:30] shock so one day has passed her and him
[1:36:33] went hunting and we could never get old
[1:36:35] Gabe to line up to church he just
[1:36:37] wouldn't do it
[1:36:38] he wouldn't come to church he said our
[1:36:41] eyes don't go down there where those
[1:36:44] hypocrites is I said but Gabe as long as
[1:36:48] you stay out there bigger than you
[1:36:50] you're hiding behind them see I said you
[1:36:53] are hiding behind him you're smaller
[1:36:55] than they are they don't they do go down
[1:36:58] and make an effort see and so he said I
[1:37:02] thinks a lot of you mr. bill but I know
[1:37:06] all John's girls down there he ain't
[1:37:08] nothing he shoots craps and all that I
[1:37:10] said that's all right Gabe see that's
[1:37:13] all right but remember Jones has to
[1:37:15] answer for that
[1:37:15] you don't have to you see if you just go
[1:37:18] I said you've got a good
[1:37:21] pasta Oh pastor Jones is one of the
[1:37:23] finest men's there is in the country I
[1:37:24] said let him be your example if you
[1:37:27] can't look further than that let him be
[1:37:29] your example so one day brother Jones
[1:37:32] said took old Gabe hunting and said we
[1:37:34] got more rabbits and birds that day that
[1:37:36] we could hardly pack and said come and
[1:37:38] the evening come in the evening said Oh
[1:37:41] Gabe was coming behind all loaded down
[1:37:43] you know like that and his wife was a
[1:37:45] real loyal Christian and she had a place
[1:37:48] right there a Holy Ghost filled woman
[1:37:50] scene and this is there's a key there
[1:37:53] that even though her husband was not in
[1:37:56] that condition she was their loyal e her
[1:38:02] heart was part of the vision she was
[1:38:04] supporting that ministry her hand was to
[1:38:06] the plow and the sword was in the other
[1:38:08] hand fighting for her husband's
[1:38:10] well-being for a husband salvation for
[1:38:12] the people in her community she had a
[1:38:13] burden she was connected to the burden
[1:38:15] for the Spirit of God because the Spirit
[1:38:17] of God you see in something we always
[1:38:19] we've got to remember the Spirit of God
[1:38:21] knows every name that's in the Lamb's
[1:38:23] Book of Life he knows if your neighbor
[1:38:25] is an elected seed or even a person that
[1:38:28] can be saved in the second resurrection
[1:38:30] if you're in a ambivalent state or in a
[1:38:33] two minded state I should say sorry but
[1:38:35] good but if you're in that state you're
[1:38:38] not much effect with the book it can
[1:38:40] hardly use you very well but if your
[1:38:42] whole heart and become part of this
[1:38:44] vision your affections and everything
[1:38:47] have focused me and just you become used
[1:38:52] of God and a far greater way and you'll
[1:38:53] be able to feel
[1:38:54] burden of the spirit that is fear to
[1:38:57] reach out and find those rehab stuff
[1:38:59] find those people in Egypt that you need
[1:39:01] to spread the sea for them so that they
[1:39:02] can comfort why how your prayer your
[1:39:05] intercession speak now we knew become
[1:39:11] like this is just coming when you become
[1:39:14] like those that were building the wall
[1:39:15] of Nehemiah you're going to go through
[1:39:17] the trials that David you're gonna face
[1:39:19] the same balance if you decide that you
[1:39:21] know what I'm not I might go and visit
[1:39:23] them and I'll go and be part of their
[1:39:25] service and then I'm going back to
[1:39:27] Babylon well then I'm going back I'm
[1:39:29] gonna go sit in my home what are the
[1:39:32] people in the wilderness when the pillar
[1:39:34] of fire moved when the pillar of fire
[1:39:36] was up and going but those guys were
[1:39:38] tired you know honeys time stay
[1:39:42] home children we're staying home tonight
[1:39:44] and they stay in their tent and that
[1:39:46] pillar of fire goes and that leaves them
[1:39:48] behind and then they've got to wake up
[1:39:51] and they wake up out of their stupor and
[1:39:52] they come out of the tent and there's
[1:39:54] nobody there because they decided to
[1:39:57] stay home and now they're going to play
[1:39:58] catch up and they're going to go find
[1:40:00] them and they're walking through the
[1:40:01] wilderness dangerous because you see all
[1:40:03] the bandits and all the demon powers are
[1:40:05] all out there and the congregation's go
[1:40:07] on the pillar fires gone and those
[1:40:09] people become susceptible and you know
[1:40:10] what when they finally get back to the
[1:40:12] camp this this favorite thing they like
[1:40:15] so bewildered and they start thinking
[1:40:17] you know what the whole idea of Korah
[1:40:19] becomes a bit more cause look cause
[1:40:21] their minds
[1:40:24] the vision they didn't have the right
[1:40:25] mentality towards what was happening and
[1:40:29] the things of Korah and the ideas of
[1:40:31] Korah started seeming a bit more
[1:40:33] plausible that's how the devil works he
[1:40:36] works on people that haven't have two
[1:40:38] mindedness or their affections are in
[1:40:40] both camps or they're got the hand to
[1:40:43] the plow and they're looking back that
[1:40:45] person is in a double-minded state but
[1:40:48] there is a vision a fountain open in the
[1:40:50] house of David that's in this place and
[1:40:52] if we're if we've resolved in our minds
[1:40:56] to mmm come resolute in our decision

[1:44:39] nothing's gonna get done between me and
[1:44:41] them and the solution as we're part of
[1:44:45] us
[1:44:45] and these Rahab's out there the nearest
[1:44:48] it's just bow our heads for Jesus
[1:44:53] father the mail has been delivered
[1:44:58] father and I just asked Lord that you
[1:45:01] would just give me grace
[1:45:03] in their hearts of my beloved eternal
[1:45:06] family that I've been speaking to and
[1:45:07] father it's never it's not easy for me
[1:45:10] or Jesus to speak that way it's not in
[1:45:13] my nature but Lord how can I resist the
[1:45:19] heart of God that is crying to his bride
[1:45:25] - just fortune
[1:45:27] and I pray Lord that your spirit would
[1:45:30] just confirm that it's you where they're
[1:45:33] on the table whether in the congregation
[1:45:35] what
[1:45:37] wherever it be Lord you're not bound by
[1:45:40] geography you're not bound by time go to
[1:45:43] the ears and the hearts of those that
[1:45:45] are listening right now and further may
[1:45:48] Lord resolutions take place decisions be
[1:45:52] made revelations happen a new wine be
[1:45:55] poured into emptier than vessels to be
[1:45:58] filled to inebriated with spiritual
[1:46:01] inebriation stimulation of the
[1:46:03] revelation of the importance of this

[1:46:28] correction we have a heart Lord that can
[1:46:31] receive the instruction and
[1:46:33] righteousness and see these examples

[1:46:36] touched one person tonight of the
[1:46:40] glorious revelation then you have placed
[1:46:42] with an ear for our instruction I pray
[1:46:46] Lord all my heart your spirit would just

[1:47:08] other things and everything else nothing
[1:47:10] is as important as being part of the
[1:47:12] solution and being here how long my own
[1:47:18] comfort my own convenience is not more
[1:47:20] important

[1:47:29] asked Lord your mercy upon us upon me
[1:47:32] and help us Lord to break free and raise
[1:47:37] up above the thinking that we've fought
