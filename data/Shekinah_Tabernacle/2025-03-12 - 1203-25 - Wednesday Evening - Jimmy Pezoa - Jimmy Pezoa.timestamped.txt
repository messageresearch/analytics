[26:06] to pass when they had brought them forth
[26:09] abroad that he said Escape for thy life
[26:13] look not behind thee neither stay thou
[26:16] in all the plain escape to the mountain
[26:19] lest thou be consumed and verse 22 um

[26:30] th let's let's just pray again almighty
[26:35] God I have read your word Lord but I ask
[26:38] you for your
[26:39] help to be able to speak Lord to your
[26:42] people in Jesus Christ's name I ask this
[26:45] amen you may have your seats
[26:50] amen early this week I heard the
[26:54] seron the God of this evil age
[27:00] and I was supposed to preach like three
[27:03] or four weeks ago but I swap with her
[27:05] man and then I went to a funeral and but
[27:08] I'm here and I thought it was quite
[27:10] amazing that all the same they been
[27:13] preach from this Pulpit they have been
[27:15] like in the same line and I was like
[27:18] brother Arman Please Don't Preach about
[27:19] that and then Isaac he was quite close
[27:23] and I was like but tonight the night
[27:28] so we have a picture here of Sodom and
[27:31] lot escaping for his
[27:35] life big was the destruction of Sodom
[27:39] because the people that Liv there they
[27:41] was they were evil the Lord said that
[27:44] they were evil and the Bible says then
[27:47] the Lord Reign upon Sodom and upon
[27:50] Gomorrah brimson and fire from the Lord
[27:52] out of heaven and he overthrew those
[27:55] cities and all the plain and all the
[27:57] inhabitants of the cities and that which
[28:00] grew upon the grounds but his wife
[28:03] looked back from behind him and she
[28:06] become became a pillar of
[28:09] salt so one of the thoughts for tonight
[28:12] is escape for your life and don't look
[28:16] back
[28:17] amen this world can offer
[28:20] you hips of stuff but now that you are
[28:23] sitting here you shouldn't look back
[28:26] lord we are called to to escape from
[28:29] this evil
[28:30] age don't be like Lord's
[28:33] wife the brother brandham
[28:38] said I'm not too sure if was brother
[28:40] Bram but
[28:41] anyways she looked back she remember how
[28:45] good was living in the city she had all
[28:49] the um hairstyle products she could have
[28:52] go to trim her he or whatever she looked
[28:57] back cuz she was about to lost
[28:59] everything she probably was just a
[29:02] thought that she had but she looked back
[29:05] and she she was not alive to to tell
[29:07] anyone else about
[29:10] that and in the Book of Luke uh we have
[29:13] the scripture this is likewise this is
[29:16] Jesus Christ talking likewise also as it
[29:19] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[29:23] drunk they bought they sto they planted
[29:26] they build it but the same day that lot
[29:28] went out of Sodom it rain fire and
[29:31] brimstone from heaven and Destroy them
[29:33] all even th shall it be in the day when
[29:36] the son of man is revealed we have that
[29:40] we know
[29:41] that in Sodom they were building they
[29:45] were living their lives they didn't even
[29:46] consider what was going to happen they
[29:49] didn't know they were just too busy
[29:51] doing their own
[29:53] things but Sly it was one thing that the
[29:56] city got destroyed
[29:58] and only one family
[30:01] survived we find another example in the
[30:03] Bible is
[30:06] Noah but as the day of Noah where so
[30:10] shall also the coming of the son of man
[30:13] be for as in the day that they were
[30:15] before the flood they were eating and
[30:17] drinking marrying and giving in marriage
[30:19] until the day that Noah entered into the
[30:22] ark and knew that until the flood
[30:26] came and took them all all away so shall
[30:29] also the coming of the son of man
[30:32] be again was the same situation there
[30:35] were living their lives they didn't even
[30:37] consider God the only family that
[30:41] was um that was able to be rescued was
[30:45] Noah's family the whole world back then
[30:49] got destroyed they were too busy they
[30:52] were too busy eating they were too busy
[30:56] drinking getting married which is not
[30:59] bad James getting married it's not bad
[31:01] getting married but they the Bible here
[31:03] saying that they were too busy in their
[31:05] social activities they didn't consider
[31:08] God they didn't want to
[31:12] listen book of Hebrews says by faith
[31:15] Noah being warn of God of things had not
[31:19] seen as yet mve with fear prepare an ark
[31:22] to be saving of his house by the which
[31:25] he condemned the world and became ear of
[31:29] righteousness which is by Faith No Faith
[31:33] condemned the world same as your faith
[31:37] will condemn this
[31:40] world but in order to knowah to be safe
[31:44] he had to build an ark have you ever
[31:48] seen pictures of the Ark have you seen
[31:50] how big was that
[31:53] Ark that was Faith expressed was not
[31:57] just like you I believe that Jesus is
[31:59] true I'm going to stay home tonight
[32:01] because I don't really want to go to
[32:02] church he should for like a 100 years or
[32:05] so he build that Ark he trusted Jesus um
[32:09] the Lord's word he build the ark because
[32:12] that's how faith is expressed you you do
[32:15] works we are not saved by works but when
[32:18] you have faith you do the works amen
[32:26] amen so so s and Gomorrah and the old
[32:30] world had something in
[32:32] common
[32:34] unbelief they didn't believe the word of
[32:37] God they didn't want to believe the word
[32:38] of God they were too busy they were just
[32:41] too
[32:44] busy and this is what happened in this
[32:47] time this world has rejected the word of
[32:50] God there's unbelief
[32:53] everywhere they have crucified the world
[32:56] they have crucified Jesus Christ once
[32:58] again when they reject the word they can
[33:01] have big churches but Jesus is not there
[33:05] because they have reject the word second
[33:08] Peter um chapter 3 says knowing the fear
[33:11] that there shall come in the last days
[33:14] scoffers walking after their own L and
[33:17] saying where is the promise of his
[33:19] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[33:22] all thing continue as they were from the
[33:24] beginning of the creation for this they
[33:26] willingly are ignor an of that by the
[33:29] way of God the heaven were of all and
[33:32] the Earth standing out of the water and
[33:35] in the water whereby the world that then
[33:37] was being overflowed with water perished
[33:41] but the Heaven and the Earth which are
[33:43] now by the same word are kept in STO
[33:46] receive unto fire against the day day of
[33:49] judgment and predition of ungodly
[33:54] men people don't believe that those
[33:58] cities in that world the old pre flood
[34:01] world existed they can't comprehend they
[34:04] can't believe the word of God we will
[34:07] see that they are called this
[34:10] um um what's this word well I'm going to
[34:13] read this one
[34:14] anyways but that the stage of the world
[34:18] unbelief everywhere we have woman
[34:21] preaches how to enter in God's presence
[34:25] preached by some
[34:29] Apostle wearing pants makeup
[34:33] whatever they can't eat the whole book
[34:37] but it's not their
[34:40] fault they they are not chosen they
[34:43] can't really see it we'll see here soon
[34:46] says 2 Corinthians chapter 4 says in
[34:49] whom the God of this world Satan hath
[34:52] blinded their mind of them which believe
[34:55] not L the light of the Glorious gospel
[34:57] El of Christ who is the image of God she
[35:00] will shine unto them she will shine unto
[35:02] them they have being
[35:05] blinded how
[35:07] blessed how blessed you
[35:13] than let's have this mega
[35:16] churches Mega Lots Mega
[35:20] musicians everything's big and shiny and
[35:24] man
[35:25] wow imagine playing in the band
[35:29] eh they have the buildings they have the
[35:32] instruments they have
[35:34] everything they don't have God they
[35:36] don't have Jesus they rejected him they
[35:39] don't want
[35:41] him they say that the gospel is to all
[35:45] woman with long hair to all they don't
[35:48] even look
[35:50] pretty what a bunch of
[35:53] flies but that's a stage of the world
[35:58] I think there let's read Romans 1 says
[36:02] professing themselves to be wise they
[36:05] become fools and change the glory of the
[36:08] uncorruptible god into an image made
[36:11] like the corruptible man and to birds
[36:14] and for footed beast and cripping things
[36:17] wherefore God also gave them up to the
[36:20] uncleanness through the last of their
[36:23] own Hearts to the their own bodies
[36:26] between themselves
[36:28] who change the truth of God into a lie
[36:31] and worship and serve the creature more
[36:33] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[36:36] amen for this cause God gave them un to
[36:41] vile affections for even the woman did
[36:44] change the natural use of the which is
[36:46] against nature and likewise also the men
[36:49] living the natural use of the woman burn
[36:52] in their lust one towards another men
[36:55] with men working that which is is unly
[36:58] and receiving in themselves that
[37:02] recompense themselves that recompense of
[37:04] their era which was meat and even as
[37:08] they did not like to retain God in their
[37:11] knowledge God gave them over to a
[37:14] reprobate mind to do things which are
[37:19] not
[37:19] convenient they didn't want God in their
[37:22] lives so God give them a reproved mind
[37:26] so now as they do evil things they feel
[37:29] that they're doing the right
[37:31] thing we have parades we have people
[37:33] that they're so proud nothing I don't
[37:36] have anything against people that they

[37:48] world but I couldn't be friends with
[37:51] them

[44:21] get destroyed
[44:23] amen a big difference between the of
[44:27] Jesus Christ and the rest of the
[44:30] churches is that we accept
[44:34] Jesus the Jesus that was hung upon a
[44:37] cross and this Jesus the
[44:43] word the world they love Jesus this man
[44:48] that came down from heaven and died for
[44:51] their
[44:52] sins but they can't accept
[44:55] this they can't
[44:59] they were not called to accept this but
[45:03] you you and me
[45:07] Hallelujah glory to God you were called
[45:10] to accept the word of of of God
[45:13] Amen Romans 8 says for ye have not
[45:19] received the spirit of bondage again to
[45:23] fear that word was prophesied here not
[45:27] long ago but ye have received the spirit
[45:30] of adoption whereby we cry ABA father
[45:34] the spirit itself bear witness with our
[45:37] spirit that we are children of God I was
[45:40] listening um seon from um a pastor from
[45:47] Venezuela I had this um
[45:51] verse I was driving the van I just start
[45:54] to cry my own um
[45:58] how you
[46:00] cool my own Revival in the van that was
[46:04] me in in Jesus because the spirit of God
[46:08] that is in you talk to your spirit and
[46:11] reveal to you that you are children of
[46:13] God and doesn't matter how the day goes
[46:16] doesn't matter what are you going to do
[46:18] doesn't matter what can happen to you
[46:20] during the day you are a children of God
[46:24] amen amen amen
[46:27] and if children then his his of God and
[46:31] join his with Christ and it so be that
[46:34] we suffer with him and that we may also
[46:37] glorify together for I reckon that the
[46:40] suffering of this present time are not
[46:43] worthy to be compared with the glory
[46:46] which shall be revealed in US amen just
[46:49] waiting for that day my brother for the
[46:51] inest expectation of the creature
[46:54] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[46:57] sons of God there's a big
[47:01] expectation for you and
[47:05] me and as this well they have reject
[47:09] Jesus Psalms 118 says the stone which
[47:15] the builders refused it become the head
[47:18] and stone of the
[47:22] corner this mad people of the old days
[47:26] all the rabis and people that study the
[47:28] Bible they just refus him was just way
[47:32] too simple this man who's this man he's
[47:35] not a king he can do all the Miracles
[47:38] yeah but he doesn't want to belong to uh
[47:43] to our fellowship he doesn't want to
[47:45] belong to our church so I'm
[47:48] not but we have accepted
[47:51] him Hebrews 12 also said looking unto
[47:55] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[47:58] faith who for the joy that was set
[48:01] before him endure the cross despising
[48:03] the shame and it said down at the right
[48:05] hand of the Throne of
[48:08] God
[48:10] hallelujah the author and finisher of
[48:13] our
[48:15] faith the Bride of Jesus Christ we're
[48:18] going to have to be tested like no one
[48:22] else because the thing that this Rapture
[48:26] the Raptor
[48:27] of the church hasn't happened well it
[48:30] did happen more than once actually but
[48:33] not in these days but we're going to be
[48:36] tested like gold and you know how the
[48:40] gold was Ted with fire prove you're
[48:44] going to have to prove that you're a
[48:45] bride you're going to have to prove that
[48:47] you can stand in this world and
[48:51] shine hallelujah amen there a beautiful
[48:55] testimony from a all this daughter of
[48:59] Lilia she went to be my
[49:02] daughter
[49:04] and she is the only one in her school
[49:07] that wor
[49:09] cured man in this day in that
[49:14] school there one children of God that
[49:18] just saw to all of them how the things
[49:21] are supposed to be but do you think that
[49:24] the devil is happy with that
[49:27] do you think that the devil is happy
[49:28] with you of course not cuz you are
[49:32] shining and just keep shining
[49:36] amen but the the whole thought of this
[49:41] sermon of this little words that I can
[49:44] share to you is Jesus Christ knocking at
[49:47] the
[49:48] door Revelation 3 says behold I stand at
[49:52] the door and knock in If any man hear my
[49:56] voice and open the door I will come into
[49:59] him and I will sub with him and he with
[50:04] me Jesus
[50:06] Christ the Holy Ghost cannot live in you
[50:09] if you don't accept him you have to open
[50:13] the door you have to let
[50:16] him just search in your life and start
[50:19] to get rid of everything what he doesn't
[50:22] want you to have
[50:27] there a painting the light of the
[50:30] world by this English painter William
[50:33] Holman
[50:35] hunt there's a beautiful story in this
[50:37] painting and it's like this man he
[50:41] painted Jesus cried knocking on the door
[50:44] and someone asked him oh you forgot the
[50:48] door
[50:49] handle and he said no because the door
[50:53] of the human heart only can be opened
[50:56] from the inside side yeah that's why
[50:58] Jesus he just knocked he doesn't want he
[51:01] doesn't pull the door yeah he's
[51:04] knocking and if you want to open the
[51:06] door to him man that's going to be the
[51:09] Glorious Day in your
[51:13] life to
[51:15] receive the Holy
[51:18] Ghost and this is a little bit of my
[51:21] testimony you have to get to one point
[51:24] in your life that you don't want to live
[51:27] your life
[51:29] anymore that was for me how how I think
[51:32] I I received it anyways I was like Lord
[51:36] I'm 23 years
[51:39] old I'm a drug addict I drink pretty
[51:43] much the whole day I
[51:46] swear I messed it
[51:49] up but Lord if you give me one chance to
[51:53] start over again I just want to start
[51:57] all over
[51:59] again and in that moment when you don't
[52:02] want to leave and when you are fully
[52:04] empty cuz man when you're in the world
[52:06] you think you're the coolest of the
[52:08] coolest me and David we we see so many
[52:11] people in Wellington man wearing all
[52:13] these funny clothes and I'm like man

[52:19] finest of my wardrobe and
[52:27] oh
[52:27] boy full of Pride yeah they look
[52:32] awesome this world think that they're
[52:34] awesome but I didn't want to live like
[52:37] that
[52:37] anymore and in that moment when you
[52:40] fully can just accept that you are no
[52:42] one Jesus Christ can live in your
[52:46] life
[52:48] and I can't say that I'm
[52:51] proud because I didn't do that the Lord
[52:55] he just shut every window and every door
[52:59] I didn't have
[53:00] any anywhere to to run that was it that
[53:05] was me I just I tried to kill myself but
[53:10] the Lord Jesus Christ he says
[53:14] no so a young
[53:17] person there's a way to be overcome in
[53:22] this evil
[53:24] age by yourself
[53:27] no way with the blood of Jesus
[53:31] Christ
[53:33] 100% And from Jesus Christ who is a
[53:36] faithful witness and for the and the
[53:38] first begotten of the de and the prince
[53:41] of the Kings who are the rest of the
[53:43] Kings I'm looking at them all the Earth

[53:48] from our sins in his own
[53:51] blood and had made us King and priest

[53:57] to him be glory and Dominion forever and
[54:01] ever
[54:03] amen one day we're going to get to
[54:06] heaven and it's not going to be
[54:08] because anything that we have done it's
[54:12] just going to be because of him just
[54:15] because he died on the cross for you and
[54:17] me and you have shed his
[54:20] blood
