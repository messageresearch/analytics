meant a lot to to the people that visited us and again our love that we have for each other and that we bring and show to people that come in here and as brand new and might have some some walls that they've built along the years denominational walls walls where they got hurt and and and they just want to defend themselves and we can come here and relax among each other and just be ourselves and

wonderful to have you although visitors it's nice here people go on holiday but then people come on holiday so it's wonderful to see everyone I mean if we've got that do we have that going slide show I mean if you got our Bibles do you want to turn to Isaiah 53 with me we're going to read most of Isaiah 53 that's me am i driving I'm driving okay good the guys are 53 and we're gonna read a large portion of this so C is here and I was a fifty three and one it says who hath believed our report and to whom as the arm of the Lord revealed for each shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and antiquated acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so he opened openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he were and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him and he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand amen my lord Lycia spray-in gracious father we have read your word lord I just pray you just take it Lord and bless your word now father we commit the service unto your hands have your way please in every life we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you friends you may all have your seats this morning I'd like to approach a subject if I may about divine character divine nature now we understand that there's only one thing we take with us and that's our character we don't take our riches our gold our education our anything that we have in our human ability you know gathered or done we take our character with us that's all we take and God is looking for a people that have his character he's not looking for anything else he's looking for character brother Brahim said when Eliezer went to go get Rebecca well went to go get a bride for Isaac and found Rebecca that he was looking for character and God is looking for character and a people and we understand that all of this the scripture we have the message we have this is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's a person being made known it's more than doctrinal and you know just a school of thought but it is a person being expressed and now Christianity is that same person being expressed not just in one person anymore as God the fullness of God here bodily in a man but now it's in a many membered body so as a city just being in one it's in many so the same character that was in him has to be in you the same life that was in him has to be in you this is Christianity to be a Christian is to be christ-like amen so we're we are called to live out the definition of being a Christian is to be christ-like now we understand that the only way this can happen as if his life comes unto you now brother Branham and I'm gonna this is just my words wait where are we this is just my words this may not make sense to you but in my notes this is how I kind of right now we read in the scripture it said but it pleased God to bruise him that pleased God to brew some now in him was eternal life this is Jesus in him was eternal life all of salvation was in him healing was in him deliverance was in him overcoming power over everything was in him but it had to be released and to be released it wasn't just for Hermes is for this cause I've come into the world so for this course the reason he came into the world as his life would be poured out it would be given it wouldn't just be bottled up he didn't just want to be all by himself the whole plan of redemption is not just God dwelling by himself but redemption is I have a family I have a wife I have children and I want them to be gathered to where I am I want to express myself to them that they would love me in return this is redemption and so now God the brother bremen and and I'll fight you know we'll get down to the courts but he here II he sees a sculpture of Moses that Michelangelo sculpted and he said that the reason it's a masterpiece is because Michelangelo after what he had seen in his mind was now in marble in a statue as he was so struck by what he saw what he saw his mind had become material he took this hammer and he cried out speak and he struck it on the knee and there's a there's a gash there's a small mark in the in the it would be the statues right knee and brother BAM said the reason it's a masterpiece is because of the mark is because of the wounding the wounding makes it the masterpiece it's not the it's not the incredible sculpture work though that is incredible but it is it is the mark in the knee and he said when God when when Jesus what made Jesus the masterpiece is the wounds as the wounding because the wounding the wounding released a life and it's the same I'm just going to come right down to your address what's in US has to come out and it comes out by wounding it comes out by affliction it comes out by hardship doesn't come out by the good times your real character comes out in hardship and trial and you don't know which way is up or down or left or right that's when your real character comes up that's when your real nature comes out and and if you don't have that life whatever comes out of you is what's in you so I say the wounding allowed his life to come forth now and that life really was a divine character this is just my words now this this is this is what has to happen with us I'm just gonna read some scriptures as a background because we take our character with us God is going to have a people that are made in His image that's what he that is his purpose because in order I'll just black this out for a second remember a a man when he gets married he doesn't marry he marries the same specie and reality when when when whenever we were looking for a spouse we're looking for any what was our heart what's in us what's the river like you know what's really we can say a whole bunch of things but when we got married we're looking for something that was complimentary they mean so we were looking for a fit so for myself I was looking for the feminine side of me the feminine part of me hallelujah I believe I struck gold hallelujah that's just a very unbiased opinion but I was looking for the the revelation of of what what is my really what does my heart really want to express amen and then I found Chris to eat and here we are glory to God I mean but God but we're looking for their revelation that's in us and so now if God is if God is looking for a for a wife if God is looking for a wife he's not looking for people that just join a club or have a religion or heifer well this is our way of life he's looking more beyond that he's looking for a people that are him he's looking for the feminine part of him that's what he's looking for he's not looking for anything else he wants to find a people that have his character have his nature that's what he's looking for because the marriage is his in the book of Revelation that the marriage of the lamb has come now I can't marry an animal I have to marry the same specie so in order for him to marry for a lamb has to marry another lamb right you know and so he's got to marry someone who's exactly like him and that's why now but the thing is when we're born we have a part of that's the real part as dormant it's a seed that's just laying there that's the real us it has a divine character it has potentials in it are you following me it has potentials it has the potential to be loving and long-suffering and gentle and meek and have meekness and faith and and all those things it has it but it's just laying there but in it but then when we are born this kind of flesh begins to live but that's not what God is God's not looking for carnal flesh he's not interested in where we're from what color skin we have what nationality what language we may speak those things as God is a God of variety but but if you boil it all down he's looking for that for that seed he's looking for his children and we can be buried in all kinds of concrete and unbelief and and and complexes and pains and hurts and misunderstanding that can be buried away but as soon as the light strikes that seed hallelujah it has to live because there's a life in it it's a living seed it must come to life amen and I trust you can say and it did hallelujah and it did begin to lose and it did begin to grow and what was laying as a potential on the inside that seed began to manifest itself hallelujah and that's what he's looking for that's what he's looking for and so this is why you've been I trust that's why you can say God spoke to me there's something more it's just more than religion more than a nice idea I may not be able to understand it but that's why there's a pool there's a call and it's a call to God is calling you whether you recognize it or not I want to manifest my character in you I want to manifest my life in you that win at all whether it's all said and done and you gathered around the throat he looks at himself in a people amen this is what this message is to produce and this award does the word will produce what it's meant to produce we don't have to cook it up sugarcoat it whatever you know it will produce what we'll produce and that's why we can have such confidence Lord if this word has been seen to produce you and a people like never before then it will I accept it I believe it I walk in it I don't understand all things but I see Jesus and that's the main thing and you'll beget you because you got to look deep down into yourself and say do I see the character of God in me and the good times but mainly in the bed because there has to come it's like Jesus he was called The Rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley now in order to get the fragrance out of the I may get it because I normally get things mixed up if I have to either one the Rose of Sharon I believe it is it's got to be crushed to get the fragrance out in order to get that sweet smelling perfume it's got to be crushed it's got to be I can't just sit there in an advice and look nice or be sitted there you know in a garden looking beautiful it's got to be taken it's got to be cut down it's got to be crushed that's why it's called the Rose of Sharon and now we are called remember we have to be crushed there's a life that has to be expressed out of you it's got to be a crushing there's got to be a wounding in order for a life to come forth if you wanted to this is a different kind of service but here we are God is looking for character we can shout we can scream we can dance we can do all kinds of things but if the character of God is not in us we've missed the mark we must have his character that's what that's what he's looking for because these people in Matthew chapter 7 they come to Jesus they say have we not cast out Devils in your name every not prophesied in thy name have we not done many mighty works and he never says no you never did those things he said I just never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so they did all those things that are anointed they did supernatural things but he never knew them never intimately became one with him because our workers of iniquity they wouldn't take his word see and so he's looking for himself and a people now according s as this is in 2nd Peter according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby a given was exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the bad me divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so there's a we are called to be partakers of his divine nature now it's season Philippians 3:8 2:11 yea doubtless I count all things but the loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung this is how I've gotta weigh up your past life I counted it but dung that I may win Christ all the good and the bad you did many times we count the bad but dying you've gotta count the good right that I may win Christ the Apostle Paul did do some good things as a Pharisee he lived a holy life outwardly he looked good he was very devout he was sincere those are good things but he had to count it all but none that he may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and we all say hallelujah we know him in the power of his resurrection and and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death effort by any means I might obtain and to the resurrection of the Dead so he's saying that we have to be and the Fellowship of his sufferings because the it's through hardship and trial that we are that his character has molded and shaped into us he says this this is in first Peter 4 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happen unto you but rejoice and so much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happier ye for the spirit o spirit of glory and of God rest upon you on their part has evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified so we are partakers of Christ's sufferings there is a measure of suffering for the church but there's a reason for it it's not in vain all the hardship you know everything would go through it's a wounding but it's to release a life it's to release a life it's not just that he can deliver you and heal you and you know be your comforter and God through those things that's all part of it too but there's a it's a release it's a wounding amen it's a wounding and we have to be willing friends maybe he doesn't do a vain thing we may not understand what's going on but you have to have confidence Lord you're in control you've allowed me to be wounded you've allowed me to be afflicted because there's a life on me and it has to be released it's got to be a character that's got to be expressed amen there's a job but he not the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold now gold in the scripture represents the eating so when he has tried amen he knows he knows that when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold now in the New Testament the word I may get it wrong but there's a the root word over I think tried or tempted I may be totally wrong but it comes down to the definition of I mean the word means to be assayed to be tried now an essay when you think of a like in geological terms as they take a big column of rock that they've drilled out and they take sections of it and they pummel it in a ball mill so it becomes powder and then they begin to look at what's in this rock that's being assayed and that's like us we get s8 you know we get ground down gada lads are grinding to go on we get thrown in a ball mill and if you've ever used a ball mill I have but not for rock but for but for kiwifruit testing it's a very violent thing it's it's got a ball bearing and it shakes very fast and and when it's all said and done the key for it doesn't look like key for it anymore how much more a rock that's been ground down to powder but the reason is now there's an essaying going on and the part of the essaying is not only Galkin see what's in you but you can see what's in you they meant because you got to be able to see you gotta be able to see hey this is God and me I would have I would have reacted to this to this very differently before I met him but now after I've met him I'm responding in a way that even surprises myself hallelujah this is what he's got to do and so because he has to prove her salvation amen time-tested memorials of God brother Brown speaks about we're going to be time tested amen still loving the Lord still serving him still praising him amen and the good and the bad in the up and the down when everything's wonderful when everything's very unone derful hallelujah can you praise him in the storm I mean can you praise him when things look look like your backs against the wall in your in front of you is a firing squad can you praise them can you that's the see there's now a wounding what's in you what's in you will come out we can may full one another and put on a church face and a and an officer and say everything's peachy but God looks beyond that we may be able to fool one another but God looks beyond that and he sees what's in you amen there will be no actors in heaven no Pharisees in heaven only the genuine will be there now this is brother Bernie speaking he says and I stood up there speaking of michelangelo's Moses and I stood there Los Angeles at Forest Lawn oh there's a replica of Forest Lawn the real ones in the Vatican one day and my heart jumped how many has ever been to been in Forest Lawn that's a great that's a famous cemetery if you're not sure there's a statue of Moses by I believe it's Michelangelo it's a perfect statute all but on the right knee there's a Knick about half an inch deep and the guide I was looking he pointed out to me said Michelangelo spent a lifetime of trying to make he was a sculptor is trying to make the image of Moses back in his mind he had in his mind what Moses should look like he had that in his heart what Moses should look like and when he spent his life time a chisel but here Robert stand back looking at year after year after year he worked on it finally it was completed he stepped back and he laid down his rag and his hammer and he looked at the statute was so perfect the image of Moses that he had in his heart till he got so beside himself he grabbed the hammer and struck at holid speak it's called Michelangelo's masterpiece that great something in that sculptor that vision that he had of what Moses ought to be with was only portraying and type the Great Father God he had anis half before the foundation of the world a son because he is a father but it was still in the genes of his word and he created a man and he had I had to put him on free moral agency but that man fell but the great sculptor God who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again he made a Noah he died drunk he made a Moses that failed to keep his word he made prophets that run in time of trouble he kept building and moulding until after all he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him his nature what was in his heart what a son should be now don't just put this on Jesus when I read this or singing his nature to reflect him that's you as well that's me amen because that's what we are to reflect he says and there is a broken piece on his leg knee of Michael knee of Moses where Michelangelo struck it with his hammer for he was so inspired see there was something inside of him at the beginning that he drew a mental picture of what he thought Moses ought to look like and when he had seen that reflected before him the very thing that he had on his mind what he thought Moses should look like he carried that vision with him all them years and years as he took the great piece of granite and a chip of piece here and there and Mark it down because it had to come perfectly and when it was perfected before him he seen the reflection of what was in his mind and that's what inspired him so to strike the image and cry out speak for all his years of toil had paid off his great handiwork had been fulfilled now we see that and I got inspired by it because I thought of that really the mark on the league was what made it to me the masterpiece it's the wounding we cause that wounding a ment we all caused the wounding but it was the wounds that made it the masterpiece because the wounds allowed the release of the life and it's the same thing with us it's the same thing with us we can't just be walking around you know with this eternal life it's going to be expressed his character has got to be expressed I mean his nature has to be expressed and you see God God in the scripture main part of his character when it's expressed as when his children go sideways when they're lost and undone when redemption has to happen why did Jesus come he's the image of the invisible God he came to seek and seek and find that which is lost he came to redeem amen he didn't come to the ones who had it all together he came to the woman at the well he had to express Redemption she was wounded she was wounded by this world and he had the answer to those wounds hallelujah Legion was wounded by this world and then just he didn't just suddenly one day wake up with a thousand demons in them I mean he took a step off the road maybe by some influence of someone anybody found himself eventually in these terms and he wouldn't have been happy there but there was wounds there amen but in the master winners way hallelujah the master winners way I mean because he had an answer to those words amen Peter James and John all them they were wounded Matthew the textbook that he was willing to do no one liked him he wasn't accepted because he was a tax collector he's working for the Romans there was a wounding but then Jesus came and he was the answer to those wounds he's the answer to our wounds friends he's the answer to our words I mean here's the balm in Gilead he is the restorer of our souls he is our healer glory to God I'm glad before there was the wounds there was the healer before there was a lost and broken people there was a redeemer before that was manifest that he was there with these potentials and now they are so wounding now we become believers and it's very easy sometimes we come out of the world and those things God just heals it's very easy sometimes right but then it's when we come in among the house of our friends come in among believers and it's really the wounds of the believers are the ones that cut the deepest hallelujah isn't that right it's the it's the misunderstandings and fellowships and between brother and sister things that maybe not even really have an answer sometimes you know iron sharpens iron I mean we're a one big ball mill hallelujah sometimes we had a thing being ground sometimes we're the ball bearing because we hit us you know mold each other but it's but it's the wounding from from the ones who are closest to us those the ones that can be the deepest now but now here it comes that there's a purpose in that God saw that coming God knew it was going to happen and it had to actually be that ways because there's a life in you there's a life and it's not your natural life that he's looking for to be expressed he's not looking for that he's looking for that eternal life he's looking for his nature what's really in you it's gonna be proof you know God is in man and he's identifying himself today in his church and the born-again Christian God identifies himself that he remains God and the outside world will only know God as they see God in you and I that's the only way they'll know God is when you are written epistles epistle of the Scripture we are rid of all men and the life that we live for reflects what's on the inside of us a man is identified by the works that he does so our works should be good see always good because we are representing Lord Jesus Christ so the life we live reflects what's in you and when I'm born of the Spirit of God I'm a part of God that's all I am identified with him see that he is my father then my life should reflect him as my life reflects my earthly father and the image that he is and that's why you see you know if I put those photos through and brothers and sisters of their of when they are young and the appearance and grandparents sometimes and it's like everyone says time-travelling because naturally we look so much like our parents because it's a physical manifestation of a you know life but then there's also the character is passed down and their natures passed down now that's just natural life where so much you know whether we like it or not we become our parents on the natural level we do we start to speak like them we have mannerisms like them you know and it's you know you know I wasn't expecting a big hallelujah chorus right there but but it's true on the natural side we do because it's passed down but and if that is the case now naturally how much more eternally amen because we're not really called here to express our natural sure God uses that there's there's good qualities that he passes down but that's not all he wants us to express he wants us to express his divine nature if we are Christians that old life is dead and buried I mean it's dead and it stays did him that is dead is free from sin the scripture says so if you really did you're free from sin Alleluia and I'm talking about not naturally dead but if your old life is dead then you're free from sin so your life is reflected in you and and God our fathers reflected in us when we are born and conformed here to us so much now this is go to a scripture it's go to Ephesians I don't have this in my notes let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 I trust this little study is helpful in some way what are we looking to become what are you looking to become you know because all of us are behold something when I was young enough she had this probably me you know me talks about when I was young I loved cricket and I wanted to become Danny Morrison all who remember her a few generations back he's a fast bowler and I wanted to bawl like him I wanted to run up to the wicket like him I wanted to if there was an UMP I wanted to basically take his ear off every time I bowled like he did I want to be exactly like him cuz I was beholding an image this is what I wanted to be and of course it chops and changes as you go through the years but you'll be holding something and you want to become that now when you become an adult you're still be holding an image you're still be holding an image but which one are you beholding are you beholding someone successful in the world and the ideal you know what New Zealand dictates is this is how you know this is what family should have and be in things in this in the society is that where you'll behold it or are you beholding what is the image of God what do you want to become because if you whatever you behold you will become others very successfully or not very successfully but you'll you'll start becoming like that I don't want to become like this world I want to become like my maker I want to become like my father I want to be I want to do them proud here's my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased I mean here's my beloved bride and whom I'm well pleased she's the apple of my eye I mean she's wonderful she's the one I've been waiting for all these thousands of years and here she is hallelujah so I can express my love to her and she can love me in return that we want to behold that kind of image I mean this great this great romance between us and God hallelujah this is what we want to be you know I want to become him and if we read in Ephesians here let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 and we'll read we'll just start from verse 12 but brother Brown speaks I think in the scripture I mean in the mrs. paradox cases we've come to an Ephesians again now that means who have come back with a Ephesian Church was when Paul was writing to it we've come back to that spot again but the only difference now is the Ephesian Church aimed at the mark of the high calling to becoming mature form of him but they relaxed and Avista the church went from there down to the dark ages we've came back to that spot but we are not anointed to just a mat and relax and go down we're anointed to a mat and become that's what the bride is called to be we don't just aim at becoming him we become him everything he is we become by his grace he became me the scripture says he became a sinner he became you know rejected afflicted he became a sinner he became a sinner for me and he took my sins to hell hallelujah that I do not need to carry them to hell he took them to hell on my behalf it means that he became a sinner that I would become him by His grace so I become I'd become righteous perfect hallelujah everything God is everything all of his nature all of us how he looks at things his mind everything he is as hard I would I would manifest that Amen let's just not put Jesus as just a man in a robe that walked on the shore of Galilee he had a character like none other I mean you read the Sermon on the Mount and there's God he's expressing his character in the Sermon on the Mount blessing to the meek listen to the humble listen to the you know listen to the merciful and all those different things he's that's his character being expressed hallelujah and I believe he started with that is because he's saying this is what I'm going to produce into people hallelujah this is what we're growing - this is what we should be looking Lord make me more like me make me more likely so in Ephesians 4 and 12 for the perfecting of the saints now that word perfect thing it actually means a maturing because his blood makes us perfect by what an offering it says in Hebrews he has perfected them forever that is sanctified he is by one offering he has perfected us in that way so we are perfect as in sinless perfection we are that way if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us it's first John right so the believer that's walking in the light as he is it alight amen his blood cleanses you from all sin that's why it's so important to walk in the word for your day because you have fellowship it's not just you were to walk in the light you can't walk next to it you can't just sympathize what you got to be in it because he is in that light you won't have fellowship with God walk in the light for your day that's what first John 1:7 says and then he his blood cleanse us from all sin and then if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us hallelujah and so now his blood poor fix us but then there has to be a maturing that's why this word perfecting actually means to be it doesn't talk about being sinlessly perfect it means a maturing for the perfecting or the maturing of the body for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ this is what we're pressing to be this is what we're going to become they meant that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk and the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves under the Sevilla sness to work all uncleanness with greediness I mean greediness but ye have not so learned Christ and you can keep reading down he says this is what we're aiming to be this is this is what this is the mark of the high calling that we will grow to the fullness it sees into the fullness of the the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ this is what we're growing into and this is what this age is called to become hallelujah I'm so glad that that's the case this is this is a every individual member it's going to grow into the measure of the fullness of Christ hallelujah whatever God dictates that to be I do not know but this is what we're called to become that's why that's why in this age we're not called just to Plato and and now we're used to everything and this is just how does when Luther came by the just shall live by faith that's as high as they could live and then Wesley came with the second worker of grace sanctification they saw they believed in justification by faith within our sanctified that's as high as they could look and then the restoration of the gifts just added to that but that's as high as they could live but now the fullness of the word is open Christ is revealed and the fullness of his word hallelujah so we don't just plateau we're not called the plateau we're called the grounds of the fullness of his image individually and that's what we should be beholding Lord you've sent your word and it says it as Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ it means we should be holding that revelation Lord your word you have expressed you in your word and we should lay before that and say Lord make us into this image amen this remember reading the Bible listening to the message it's not it's not just trying to find find things that make you happy or trying to remember it in your mind it should you should be laying before it prayerfully saying Lord the character that's in this book this is a love leader this is a love leader this is not just Lauzon and different things it's a love letter to you and so now as we read that love letter should be Lord what what you are speaking to me may I become may my character be become like this word that's what we need to do now here's something that I've that really struck me the other day now remember there's a wounding it will Express what's in you remember we have a we have this nature it has to stay dead amen and so when a wounding comes your way what is going to respond is it gonna be this guy or is it gonna be him what are you gonna let they meant he says now I have constantly done in my very best to try to and disagreeing with man in religious terms but if I couldn't take his hand afterwards no matter how sharp the thing might be and take a hold of his hands and say this is in the light of a better understanding between us and still love the person not just say it from my looks from my heart then I'm no subject at all to go out there and try to talk to people because see we must do that we must love the person see and going amongst the people of all kinds of classes and different cults and clans and religious and so forth and trying to lay the Bible down and say let's discuss it not from your Creed but or from your book of ethics but from the Bible and then not maybe some time man get real sharp but if I got one thought that I didn't like that person then I know one thing the Spirit of Christ is departed from me if I can feel that I don't like that person there's something wrong with me because the Spirit of Christ when they are at crucifying him and his own people driving the nails and his very creation he created was putting the nails that he created back into his human flesh and yet with all this heart of full of love he cried Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing you see if I don't like that person I know one thing the Spirit of Christ is departed from me that's a very powerful statement they say see if we disagree on religious terms and you still don't like the person God has departed you have grieved the Holy Ghost remember there's got to be a wounding and that wounding is to express what's really in you and if it expresses your carnal nature you got to say Lord take it from me may it truly be under your blood because when I'm wounded when he was wounded there was deity that was expressed I mean it was only getting he could have died an angry man he could have died a bitter man he could have died or his in for man he came to his own his own received him not but when it was all said and done he said Father forgive them they don't know what they do and these were the religious people that should have known what they are doing they read the scripture they knew the prophecy but they just rejected him and when he said that he truly he truly meant it he didn't have one bit of goodness in him or resentment or unforgiveness he's looking for character friends and he will not he will not substitute he will not receive something that's half done amen he will only receive his full his character now sorry for all the reading but I trust this is this means something but his own divine character predicted this Tabernacle to express himself and speaking when he came in his first coming and yet he took himself away from the great thing that he was and had his birth he could have come with a full angel salute he could have come with the chariots and the angels of heaven but he came by the way of a bomb that's his love bringing himself down to the lowest now you study the that character a little bit and then look at yourself and I look at myself but that's what he was that's who he was and that's the way he was to save you he took he became you that you might become him he took your load of sin therefore when you come when we come to meet him we will not have to stand we could not stand in the presence of God there's not way for one of us to do it but when we stand in him he's already recognized the sacrifice this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased he recognized it there was no blemish on him and yet he suffered temptation like any other man and yet he was scorned he was made fun of he was persecuted from the hour who is born into the hour that he died amen wouldn't none of us have suffered like him he died with a broken heart he was rejected he was despised but yet it pleased God to Bruce him it pleased God this is pleasing to me and he's a man hanging on a cross my God my God why has thou forsaken me and if I could dramatize a little but there's the there's the father in heaven saying this pleases me this pleases me to bruise my son on the cross his wounding is pleasing to me there's what the scripture says but it pleased God we were in Isaiah 53 it was pleasing and so now when you come and you are wounded it please God there's a I hope I'm not leaning too far but you gotta think it's actually pleasing when you go through a trial God has allowed that trial and for you to express him in that trial that's pleasing to God that's pleasing look at my workmanship look at my children look at my bride she's being crushed she's being pressed she's being afflicted this is now this may sound strange it's pleasing to me because out of that trial I'm being expressed out of that trial I'm being manifested out of that trial I'm being made known hallelujah so it's actually a privilege it's actually a privilege to be crushed and to be rent and to be misunderstood and ill treated and it's a privilege because God has allowed you gods and trusted you in that trial I know when you walk in there Amen you'll express me hallelujah because you're dead and your life is hid in Christ with God Amen now where were we see there's no okay there's no blemish on him yet he suffered temptation like any other man and it was he was scorned he has made fun of he was persecuted from now he was born to the re died and yet he returned good for evil you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you see no man can produce that character of Christ and their own ability I mean this goes beyond psychology and learn behavior this is not psychology or learn behavior it's when his character his nature comes into you he says a church cannot do that a creed cannot do that a denomination cannot do that an education cannot do that it must be a birth it's got to be a dying out and let God in it by the grace of Christ mold this type of character in you that you become him and your life and his is the same then you are sons and daughters of God then when he was going up the mountain and his cross was dragging out the footprints he says I wish I was an artist I wish I could speak so that you could mentally paint you a picture of Calvary of the most dreaded out of the world ever knew and yet they were not conscious of what was going on millions would are conscious and could I turn that pictures of that what I've said this week we're entering again a dreaded hour a fearful time and Phoenix and I'll say in Wellington and the world is bathing and the churches is bathing themselves and worldly ism and in Hollywood showmanship wine out doing the other and our members are becoming worldly and it seems they don't catch the picture and the seriousness and the revelation of the appearing of the Son of God in this last days amen I just find this very striking you say well this was 50 years ago this is more up-to-date today than it was being this is way more up-to-date the world is slumbering and sleeping but we know that these are people feet see don't be caught up on what you see upon this earth don't be caught up with the five senses what are you becoming what have you given yourself to what have you really not not consciously subconsciously what have you given yourself to have you given yourself to be made in that image out there or a religious image or even given yourself he made into his image what have you given yourself to see it takes a birth education can't do it denomination creat a church cannot do it this may sound strange but this church cannot do it physically that this church cannot make you into him it takes him to come home super Desha to come and make the word alive that's what it required him to come and do it his character to be injected into you hallelujah that's what it has to happen and so now I'm gonna read you one more thing because we all want to reign with him it's from the church age book the Smyrna and church age AC is now the reason no way I gotta say this first because I seat some statements you may find a bit strange about how it would please him that is bright bride has wounded now his love is not like our love for our children our love for our children is like parental care love which is we want to keep them from every hardship that's not his love his love is elective love his love is elective this is why he said before esau jacob aboard he says Esau have I hated Jacob have I loved and that has brought out through the scripture he's before they're born I loved one and I didn't love another one this is God's choosing so his love for you is actually an elective love it's not like parental care that's why he allows us to go through hardship because because as lovers I have chosen you I have chosen you that's his election I have chosen you and you'll become made in my image I will unite myself with you you'll be my wife that's his choosing that's his choosing that's not your choosing many times we think all we we received him know he just put something on the inside of you to to to search for him that says to he put that there first and you're just really responding to his call I'm glad that that's the case because of it was me after him then I could just change my own and go somewhere else but if it's him drawing me and his will is stronger than my will Amen his his purpose is way stronger than my purpose because his purpose doesn't change if he's called me I'm going to be there but then I have to give myself to that call cuz he gives every man a chance he gives every man woman or child and we have to respond because he does like in the days of Noah he says God will not always strive with me so it came to an end I'm not striving with you anymore I've pleaded are big of spoken I've given my word a living witness of Adam and Eve upon the earth and different ones he said I'm not gonna strive with you anymore and I'm done so there is that part of it but if your tea that's why John when he's writing me a I think third John he says to the elect lady and he's not talking to one person he's talking to the body of Christ amen so he said well that's kind of elitism well maybe it is I don't know but if God says I'm elected to walk on streets of gold oh I'll take that and say thank you I'll just be happy with that this is for me hey if you've you know it's just like if someone came here and said I give you 10 billion dollars are you can ride your thermal that's not fear what about everyone else you just say I'll take that money and I'll use it for God's glory you won't argue with the person what about these people what about this no you just say thank you and then go and joy why don't you that's very natural thing but you know same thing with God and his election feces here at us his eternal life here's my work here's me I'm gonna join myself to you you say thank you thank you lord I take you I mean I'll be your lawfully-wedded wife hallelujah and you're in control and you're my head and you love me and I love you Amen so I'm pretty happy about that that's a man if that's okay he says now why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8 17 and 18 and if children then is is of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed on us I mean unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him we must suffer to reign the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering this is a law of God character is never made without suffering you have to suffer to reign way so character is a victory not a gift that's easy to say these words but it's true character is a victory you actually wouldn't character trial you win it but in order to win in order to okay I'll just keep reading this it's not a gift a man without character can train because power apart from character is satanic but character I mean but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sit down and his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to begin to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which are to try you that's what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chasing the sons but not one of us but not not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it doesn't it isn't of God hallelujah glory we have a bit of hardship we get some speed wobbles we kind of are in the gravel half of the time things are going bad that's of God isn't that isn't that wonderful we've got to look beyond human because you know and our human mind want everything just fine and there's no trouble and just a life of ease and you know we don't really want that humanly we want that we've got to drag this thing into a body change your body will thank you one of these days but it doesn't want to go through these things right now but it'll thank you you're not schizophrenic but you know what I mean just an illustration but this thing doesn't want to you know the flesh doesn't want to serve God you know that's why we used to pander to the sky before you were born again but then God came and in his his life is stronger than this desire of this natural thing where was I it isn't of no sir so see ya the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God Hebrews 12:6 and eight for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son which receipt he receiveth but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not sons that's what he says because the church says not suffering is not of God it hasn't got it well because there's a reason now he wants you to express him and your expressed in the trial I mean he is expressed in your trial and in your hardship amen and that is when he gets glory I want him to get glory don't you I want him to be manifested upon the earth don't you a man of taro sorrows and agony that's who he was amen and if he was that way and he was acquainted with grief amen no that doesn't mean God was never displeased with him as a man this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased this is the God who knows all things he was never displeased not a single thing he did he was always pleased with him but it he is a man of sorrows tears and agony and that's the same thing now if life is going well or if life is going bad that doesn't mean if life is going well that doesn't mean God is pleased with you and now life is going bad and God is displeased with you that's not how it works and the good and the bad remember God's lovers is constant he has fully expressed his love for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that ever should believe in him amen should have eternal life that was God's love the fullness of God's I was manifested that day on Calvary amen and then the reason he sent you elijah for the Grainger's will day the Lord that's God's love too because there's a second part of redemption hallelujah this is God's love people say God's never love me well we were yet sinners he loved us the scripture tells us his love doesn't change our love can change because it's just human love so we try and put that in to God now and think well things are going bad he must not love me or things are going well he must really of me now because we're looking through human eyes with the go beyond our human understanding amen we have some musicians just a yeah just now you know but we have to go beyond human understanding if everything is going well he loves me if things that look like we're it's all done and everything's terrible he loves me if it's in between somewhere he loves me hallelujah but he allows us to go through because he's got to be a wounding there's got to be a wounding I don't have the quote but you go listen to masterpiece and brother Brahim says now as as Jesus was the second Adam there has to be a second Eve and so now the bride is the part of that masterpiece we are part of we are God's masterpiece this day the bride round the world we are part of God's masterpiece and just like Michelangelo God was molding through through the prophets rebuilding a man then finally he had Jesus upon the earth and it pleased God to bruise him please God to strike him that a life would come out now if that's the man the woman we'll go through the same thing amen because he wants that divine nature to come out to be expressed and so counted all joy count it all joy when you have fiery trials and hardship and wounding because God wants to be expressed through that wounding Amen to bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious father Lord this may have been very different kind of service but father I pray that these things would just anchor down in our souls Lord please you win Oh Lord when when your son went up that day up Calvary Oh Lord Jesus when you went up Calvary that day it was pleasing for you to be wounded that a life would be expressed and father we thank you for that wounding Lord we needed that wounding Lord that's a man you didn't want to go through the wounding but you gladly there was a joy set before you there was us around your throne made in your image redeemed sinless and perfect Lord but father may we just as we go through life now Lord we have to be wounded we are like the Rose of Sharon there's like you were look as husband and wife or one they have to be crushed and molded that a fragrance would come forth Lord may we just be yielded to you Lord that in every situation you would be manifested you would be expressed you would be declared Oh Lord may we just rejoice father Lord that you place us upon the earth that you would be manifested to a dear and dead and dying world and father may one see Jesus and father we want to grow into the measure of the fullness of the statue of Christ may we be willing Lord Jesus to be led by your hand not to pull away we want to be more like you but father it takes suffering and affliction we know that Lord but father may not pull away but may we just continue say Lord if you lead me through this if you lead me through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil because thou art with me and father we see even David Lord we would never have had the Book of Psalms without the affliction he suffered and the rejection from his own people and being on the run from Saul and being Lord he said many times my enemies can pass me about and he is in great perils many times Lord you allowed that to happen that we'd receive a Book of Psalms Lord read receive a life and that his character would be molded there was foot to rule when he stood on the Lord when he sat on the throne of Israel and father help us as well Lord you allow the wounding Lord that your life would be expressed so father may we just say yes Lord and may we walk with you father I just commit us into your hands and Jesus Christ they may you grant it Lord amen amen can we just sing that song make me more like thee oh no they sing that song when it's all said and done no sorry let's sing that song the that's I'm consuming fire oh I know the time is near where everything that I've held dear will lay before the holy consuming fire I mean let's just
