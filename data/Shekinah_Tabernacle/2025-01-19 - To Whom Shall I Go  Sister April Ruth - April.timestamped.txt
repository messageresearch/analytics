[0:00] that was a beautiful special by the way
[0:02] um so I'm going to sing a song which was
[0:04] written by a friend who lives in the
[0:07] states um the inspiration for the song
[0:10] comes from when Jesus is preaching um
[0:14] about unless you eat my flesh and drink
[0:17] of my blood you have no part in me and
[0:20] most of his disciples from that time
[0:22] went back and they walked no more with
[0:24] him and then Jesus said unto the 12 will
[0:26] you also go away and then Simon Peter
[0:29] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[0:31] thou Hast the words of eternal life and
[0:34] we believe and are sure that thou art
[0:36] the Christ the son of the Living God
[0:38] from John 6 um I'm trying to work on
[0:41] when things seem impossible to just keep
[0:43] trusting in the word of God
[1:01] to whom shall we
[1:06] go if you have the words of
[1:11] life and where can I
[1:14] [Music]
[1:16] run there's nowhere to
[1:21] run to whom shall we
[1:27] go if you have the word words of
[1:32] life and where can I
[1:37] run there's nowhere to
[1:43] run I could run to my own
[1:48] understanding I could trust what I feel
[1:52] or what I see but my heart fails me
[2:00] my heart fails
[2:04] me I could run to my own
[2:09] understanding I could trust what I feel
[2:13] or what I see but my heart fails
[2:19] me my heart fails
[2:25] me so are un to the rock of the a
[2:31] I will stand on the word The Original
[2:34] Seed cuz that won't fail
[2:39] me see God can't fail
[2:45] me so are unto the rock of the
[2:50] ages and I will stand on the word The
[2:54] Original Seed cuz that won't fail me
[3:01] see God can't fail
[3:06] me with a
[3:08] resurrection
[3:11] power peace in my darkest
[3:16] dark a strong and mighty
[3:22] tower and his words Speak Life to
[3:27] me with a resurrection ction
[3:32] power peace in my darkest
[3:37] star a strong and mighty
[3:42] tower and his words Speak Life to
[3:49] me to whom shall we
[3:55] go Lord if you have the words of life
[4:01] and where can I
[4:06] run there's no way to
[4:12] run to whom shall be go
[4:22] [Applause]
