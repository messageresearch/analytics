bless you amen let's turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 amen Ephesians 1 we're gonna read we're gonna read down from verse three familiar piece of scripture to us all I trust but blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ to us blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and loved having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace rouen Heath made us accepted in the beloved and whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace ruin he had the bounded toward toward us and all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believed you are sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession and to the praise of his glory I mean let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer shall we if you want to be remembered just want to raise your hands to the Lord gracious father we are so glad we can stand on your promises Lord and we just want to thank you we can gather this morning Lord and in your presence and just asking as we have read some of your Holy Scripture I just pray father you just come a night your word father anoint speaker and hear O Lord may your word live in every heart hear father we just want to Lord just want to just surrender the service to your hands Lord me may the service Leaf human control Lord may it just be under your control further may you have preeminence Lord not only here but in all of our lives father because you're a personal God father may we just be your love prisoners to your word and we want to pray father also Lord for the meetings up in Taranaki Lord brother Craig ministering Lord may there be a great revival break out there father bless each one that's attending the services Lord we want to commit our lives into your hands be with those who are sick Lord who those who are not here father be their portion Lord in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen I mean god bless you everyone you may have your seats this morning so I want to ice like the first aw I just like to thank brother Isaac again for preaching last Sunday he said at the end of that sermon that he did not use a single quote of brother Branham to show the message that the seventh angel brought was not something outside of Scripture but it is Scripture I mean so what we believe is not something that's added to the scripture it is the scripture right so we want to what I want to go into today is that that I want to speak about the redemption of the purchased possession and that we should be the praise of the glory of His grace as we read here that we are so Paul is speaking that in the fullness of the dispensation of times as we read here he would gather all one in Christ and that we have obtained we are predestinated unto the adoption or to the placing of sons and we are living in the age of adoption where a people will come to their position in Christ that everything that Adam lost in the garden has been restored to man and this is where we want to go today and that so now there's a bride upon the earth that's not living under her privilege she's living according to her privilege in Christ Jesus and I believe this is who we mean to be right so we're not meant to be the devil's footstool or be his puppet driven around by his spirit but he's he at his places under the bride's feet so if the Devils on your case you got to tell them you're out of your position Satan get back under my feet in Jesus Christ name so we have a right to enforce upon Satan everything that Jesus purchased for us he's given us a great inheritance in him and so it's it's it's time for us to really look into what he's given us and to possess it amen so now that that we should be but the whole reason of this is that we should be the praise of his glory now Redemption we know as as the act of saving or being safe from sin evil or error and it's the action of regaining or gaining possession of something in exchange for payment or clearing a debt so to be redeemed now is not just a not just a nice phrase but it's a reality where a people have been redeemed from the clutches of Satan and you can see that redemption in their lives right it's not a just a phrase or something nice when we talk about but it's a reality I have been redeemed I was bought with a price so one time I was under the spirit of this world walk he could in a prince of the power of the air but as but the blood of Jesus Christ loosed me from his clutches and I'm not in prison anymore I'm free right so so Redemption is a reality I mean you know as we read that we would be the praise of his glory that we should be the praise of his glory I mean that that that has that what he has done his work should be manifested in us that we would we would bring forth as price thank you I'm free Thank You being redeemed thank you your word has become a living reality in my life I mean so the bride today is no longer a slave to anything right the bride of Jesus Christ is an independent woman as brother Brown says she's not hooked up with any of man's ideas man's Creed's man's organization she's a free she's a free woman amen so she's not hooked up with anything but Jesus Christ the Living Word right so to be if we're no longer slaves I mean we are completely free I mean so the bride has been has been washed of any religion of man fashions of this world entertainments whatever may be culture we are free of all things Allu you now someone who is free acts completely different to someone who's a slave or a prisoner right someone who is a prisoner cannot you know they you know the warden tells them what they do you know they're there they're pressed into a mold where this do this you know and they have no freedom in themselves but so and and they're stuck in prison bars behind prison bars and they want to be there but the nature that we were born with wanted us to be there right because we united with this world by our first birth that's why you've got to be born again that's why your spirits got to be change that's why that laughing is going to come forth I mean because your first birth you were born wrong we were born in slaves in sin shape that iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's why we were to be born again hallelujah that we that we would receive the right life I mean to someone who's in prison it's very different to someone who's free and those who are free are free to walk with God hallelujah now in the Old Testament they had the jubilee trumpet and the jubilee trumpet when it sounded those who heard it had a right to go free they drop what they were doing there they're their slave master or whoever it was that they're in bondage to they don't have to listen to that voice anymore they heard another voice they heard another call so they had the right to drop immediately what they are doing and walk free and it's the same thing now but they had to choose to do it right if they chose not to do it then and and they preferred to stay with their master then they would be taken to the table bored in the air with an awl and they were a slave for the rest of their days so they had to they had to choose to be free and that's a thing this world the devil's made this world's very comfortable he's made it very comfortable that we don't want to you know that that many people want to stay in the muck and mire of slavery but there's a call and if you want to go free you can't go free and walk with God you have a choice right the Jubilee trumpet today is the gospel trumpet it is this message that is blasted forth amen I know one day I heard freedom when I heard this mess it depends where you're listening you may hear a man from Kentucky but I pray you heard the voice behind the voice and I heard freedom you don't the stay in bondage you read the Saints stay in slavery you can go free if you chose and something in me says that sounds just right I'm sick of being stuck in this state being bound by Satan I want to walk with God and I went free hallelujah and so this is this is part of Redemption where people have been purchased you know if something is yours it's your property right you don't share it with anyone if you've paid it off and full it's yours right and you have legal right to do what you want with that piece of property because it belongs to you right no one can tell you what to do it belongs you and you have the proof you have the paperwork to prove it's mine right and so God the bride we are not our own we are brought with a price and that's the part that's the blood of Jesus Christ so god when he became a man to die in our place to redeem us he was laying claim on his children these are mine Satan they do not belong to you they're never your property I am laying claim to what is mine hallelujah and this message is a claiming message grace placing his hand upon his bride Satan lists woman's mind I'll not share her with you she doesn't belong to you she has no part in you and you have no part in her and we have to come to that realization friends we don't belong to the devil we have no part in him here's no part in us we have no luck with him he don't we don't belong to him in any way in any fashion doesn't matter how big or small we are not his hallelujah that's why I'm glad the word is a separator it separates some unto and some away I'm just being glad I'll be separate to the Lord by the Word of God hallelujah so we should just rejoice hey man he sees in Revelations 3 and 20 behold I stand at the door and knock who is behind the door we were behind that door I mean we know Christ has kicked out of the religious system of this day but we were locked in there if any man hear my voice who's heard his voice and open the door that's your doing you would open the door look come and dwell in me I will come in them and sup with him and he with me hallelujah you know I'm glad we're living that out hallelujah amen so we're not our own were bought with a price Jesus isn't Luke 19 and 10 for the Son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost I mean so he sought you out hallelujah because you are lost now God wants to restore Adam's fallen race now we read in Ephesians that we were let's just put that back up here it is that year sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest and that would earn astiz the pledge you like a down payment of our inheritance and their word inheritance means airship so we had joint ears let's our inheritance so we have a position in Christ until the redemption of the purchased position and to the praise of his glory so he knows that ultimately the fullness of our redemption is the change of our body right with what we have received that bride has received a down payment right the Holy Spirit in our soul as a down pat it's a pledge God's given you a promise by giving you his spirit I what I began I will complete and it will be completed with the change of your body I mean that the life that ye receive that quickening power in you is the power that will change this body holy that you'll leave this dimension go to the next now in order to redeem the right price must be paid and the right price was paid I mean the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of God was shed upon the earth that was the that was the purchasing price hallelujah but then the second thing now because God doesn't want a dispute right he doesn't want the devil's the devil's the accuser of the Brethren he wants to he want to try and find a foothold and doesn't matter how small said that he can lay claims on you and by your first birth he had claims on you right by by the new birth all that is struck off then he has no claims on you no more and an order for a for something to be bought first the right price must be paid but then also anything what is what that what that sorry that piece of property there has to be a search on that piece of property that any historical dispute has to be struck off right and once those disputes have been settled then the piece of property can go into the hands of the one who purchased it right so now God made sure that every claim the devil could have on the believer was struck off and we're living in that our right the bride everything's been struck off you hallelujah we're going to realize where our free people this morning I mean it's just like buying a pre piece of property a title search is done on that property to make sure there is no dispute on who would own it Alou you God gives us that he says in the Easter seal and God gives you a promise potentially and you'll receive it and you're going to be raised up this body's going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you have to have a clearance on that deed and the clearances win everything against it's been stricken off and you've got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours everything in it belongs to you amen and when you believe on Jesus Christ our Savior and repent in a baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards them sends down the abstract which is the Holy Ghost and the abstract is the assurance is the guarantee that everything that it was ever held against you you thoroughly repented wholly and the property is bought and you hold the abstract for the insurance let somebody try and put you off the land say he belongs and you with the abstract in your hand let him try to do it there ain't a law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology they could overstep the boundaries of God's proof and abstract that the baptism of the holy ghost has recognized us in Christ Jesus we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we're already raised in him amen so when God gives us the Holy Spirit he's actually showing everything that the devil lays claim on you has been struck off I mean everything that he said on but they did this and they believe this and they are born this wrong way that's all been struck off the bride how loose that's why we can stand with a with a clear abstract deed is everyone following what I'm saying we can stand and and the devil can't push us around we have the paper with the living evidence I mean that we've been redeemed hallelujah says he says in the waters of separation death itself has no reign over a Christian Christ died announced did Amen what a marvelous what a faith that ought to build up in the people something that'll toe the mark you'll never get nothing by being a little jellyfish Christian no sir did you ever see a jellyfish you hit him he splatters over everything see jellyfish you know what usually eats them the crabs and things along the side of the seashore comes up with a Spencer cuts em and - and takes them down because the jellyfish just lays there brother we need some Christians not jellyfish but with a backbone that's right that'll stand on oh I don't mean to fuss with people but stand on your god-given rights that Christ died for certainly not pushed around we don't have to be no sir we've got an inheritance amen now inheritance belongs to us that you're privileged to have anything that you've inherited therefore accepting Jesus Christ and dying to yourself how marvelous yes sir Saint said well I'll tell you what I'm going to do no you ain't going to do nothing that's just a way to talk back to him say I know my position in Christ you might as well get away I ain't listening to you no more I've got an inheritance and we've got a title deed to an abstract that goes all the way back to Calvary the day of Pentecost when he said this is the promise unto you and to your children and then that's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call abstract deed aiming cleared all the way back to Pentecost how far back does it go how many's at four as many as the Lord our God will call if God calls you he gives you an abstract title aiming all the way back and the blood of Jesus is just as good as it had been shed 10 minutes ago every believer it's your profession we are just scared to use your rights that's all I mean we're not living in a day - just to sit back don't be discouraged by what you see right the devil's our Bluff he'll try and Bluff you out if you're Victor if you can don't don't shrink back whatever you do don't be discouraged Abraham waited 25 years but he all he saw was the promise all he saw was that promise and when God moves on your heart for your family or whoever whatever healing where a don't shrink back say God it's mine your word says bye and thy seed will be there hallelujah I mean we're just go to prison amen why not I mean we've got privileges in Christ this bride you know this is exceedingly great precious promises you look through the message everything that belongs to us in the Word of God won't belongs to us I'd say Lord I want to not just talk about it not just say that's wonderful but possess that promise hallelujah if he died if he died to give it to me I want it I'm in because you know he went through he paid a great price I mean your son sent him to Calvary there hallelujah he died because of you I mean when we're his enemy he died for us right but then he came he redeemed us that would no be more his enemy but a joint heir hey man that's amazing grace I mean so now the bride now I trust you've met him because if you're meeting me have that abstract title deed that everything that was held against you has been wiped off and then you can stand Satan I have a right to push you around I've right there to tell you to leave my my life my family my mind hallelujah I think we should take God at His Word I mean we are his purchase possession nada maybe we are right we are hallelujah he says in the token this is the from the token of 1964 I have a right as the rest of them over right just the same as Paul head I have a right the same as any man and Seaver baptized with the Holy Ghost I've got the same right because I've got the same token to show the same God purchased by the same thing for me at the same day on the same time there you are the blood the blood the token not the blood chemistry but the token the Holy Ghost right we have the life that was in the blood what was released that day on Calvary I mean his life was released right and it's coming to you and I that's why you know to me we say how do you know this message is right well he was a lie jump brother Ben was Elijah he pointed a pointed us out the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world revealed Jesus Christ in the word we say well how do you know that's right it's because by faith by hearing that word of my faith I place my hands on that lamb and the life of Jesus Christ the lamb came into me I meant he introduced the lamb to me and the life and the lamb came into me hallelujah that's why the bright we don't need to be intimidated or pushed around do you know on whom you have believed amen that's why you know you know the Apostles they came under great pressure but they had an abstract deed they had something the rich young ruler didn't have they had something that the scribes and Pharisees didn't have they had the assurance of eternal life and that's why they could stand in front the Sanhedrin who should we please mean Oh God who should we follow mean and God you tell us hallelujah amen and that's why we can stand like them doesn't matter what pressure comes on intimidation whatever more no I'm a believer I'm a believer and the reason I believers cuz I met him he was there I was there we became one Poli yeah me and my me and his would became one I trust it's the same thing with you Amen but the token the Holy Ghost the life out of the blood that comes what does that and what what does that life does comes and confirms that the tokens been purchased for that token confirms that the blood that the blood brought for you the blood purchased your Redemption the token is the evidence of at the blood he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with the stripes we were healed see blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows you're identified with that sacrifice hallelujah Amen the devil can't keep you from it that's when I stand at the platform here to face everything there is and around the world and devils God's Word promise that as long as I know that the Bloods been applied and holding that Holy Spirit here in my heart the devil has not one word to say against that yes sir we'll walk with the apostles of trod yes sir because the token paid the way the token is the evidence that the ways been paid for and we have accepted it and to prove it God gave us the token the sign that we was received who's been received hallelujah to God Amen now as I said that we have a purchase that we have an inheritance or an issue now we know the reason Jesus died to redeem his bride is that he wants to restore Adam and Eve in the garden again right so he wants to restore a people he's the second Adam there's got to be a second even as the Bride of Christ from Calvary down to now as the multi-member D the bride and he wants to take these people and he wants to restore the I'm back to what a de nieve were in the beginning right as he's he's the adamant and we're the eve right so now if that's the case Adam and Eve had dominion over the earth right they had Dominion they were told subdue it you know you're in charge of this place everything upon the earth was under their rulership and this is and that's what God wants to do is he wants to take your people when the devil still here wins sinners rampant when darkness covers the earth but taking people to manifest as victory to show that there's a people that have been redeemed that everything upon this earth is under their feet I mean what good would it be if that you're you know of God just died on Calvary for us and then the devil got deleted he just disappeared and this is all what a wonderful victory my children have now there's no enemy to face right there victory can't be proved but he allowed it to be the darkest of ages the darkest have time the most deceptive time that there is upon the earth that's when his bride comes to a full maturity halia because God wants to show the devil this is what my offering did this is what my blood does this is what my word transferred through a profit vessel a man received into a heart of faith does hallelujah he was assures victory you know we like to you know people wouldn't great great things and they celebrate they do or more that's just a little shadow compared to God what happened are we off away on we wrong amen you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you ever seen the family I can I can sign some papers now they're adopted into my family now they're one of my children placing so now we are living in a we are living in an abduction H we are where the we're the first church change as the Apostle Paul said in Ephesians four is till we all come to the fullness of the stature the image of Christ to a perfect man so they hadn't come there yet but they were pointing towards that but in the word Ephesus means to a men into relax so they and get the high call in Christ but then they relaxed and then eventually the church went down to the dark age now brother Graham says we've come to Ephesians again right the bride has come through in Ephesians and Ephesians is the placing of a people in the body the book of Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians Joshua's ministry was to fight tribes in the land right that they would drive out the inhabitants and that would be placed in the land so what Martha's preached on the mountain I mean will become men officious people would go to the land and possess their here right and now we have received the Josh in direction because God's placing you on the body Allu amen so now we're joint is joint is with Christ now under thee under the blood of bulls and goats when you read the law you see that woman in Israel were second-class citizens to the man but then and that was showing that the blood of bulls and goats could not elevate the church to be joint heirs with Christ with God they were under here but now under the blood of Jesus Christ as as as Peter writes one of his epistles that the man and the woman a joint is together right so he's showing now that the woman the bride is not a second-class citizen but the blood elevates her to be joint is are you following me so now there's a so now we've been elevated we're not seeking class citizens in the kingdom Alleluia he's made us join here so he called you out of darkness this is read his word called you out of darkness he purchased your salvation holy that's why faith when you really see Calvary it's more than a story you see it I mean you know it happened you don't you don't you haven't lent it right real faith is not learning something real faith is seeing it real faith is knowing it to be a reality holy is a win when the crust becomes a reality to you do you see it you realize he he's your Redeemer I mean he's purchased your salvation it changes your trust it change you holy and he's showing now I'm gonna take your purchase you now I'm gonna place you place you in the body place you above the devil place you above the works of this world place you above any bondage of sin that you'd have dominion over all the works of the devil a Miss whether dimly you know you know he waves his Netflix and a social media and his internet and his entertainment and all these things right he waves these things popularity music whatever may be and I trusted something and he says there's no appeal I mean my heart's been turned I'm walking a different way they can have it it's not for me probably I've got a far better thing it's not a doubt shall not that's knowing my heart's been turn I'm walking with the Lord I see my end goal I see my reward hallelujah I see what I'm walking towards Amen hallelujah just like brother Craig or boy it can be priest about making the valley full of ditches speaking about how the kings came out and they had no water then they got a prophet and he said make the valley full of ditches and you weren't there won't be any rain or anything but in water will come forth and you'll win a great victory and he said brother Bram said that's the that's actually the message of the day make the valley full of ditches they got all the malice and the strife and the formality and the envy and the intellectual ability and whatever I just take it all out and because of the end day how much water do you want right oh I've got to lay myself before God he's going to deal with me how much water do you want I wrote in my book I want to roll how that is I want to trickle out on a drama hallelujah how much of God do you want that's why you look God I want all of you brother Bram said it's like a little fish in the middle of the Pacific sang I did not drink too much because I'll drink it all he can't drink it all it's impossible it's the same thing with us and God you can't drink all as goodness the Phantom will never run dry seemed as no prison I've got one life I Mazal see if I can exhaust it hallelujah well you're in for a you know you're in for a challenge God likes a challenge prove me he sees hallelujah so how much of us word d1 how much of his goodness do you want how much of him living do you want hallelujah I want it all I don't want a little bit hallelujah I like to swim who likes swimming I like swimming hallelujah so now we are joint heirs with him he says and if children than is is of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together now in the Ephesian Church ages church age bookies is it now to these sons of God who by him overcome and are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never be any more separation from him whether he goes as bride will go pardon me what he is she he shares with us beloved on a joint ear relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are knowing and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ how we long for that day when the crooked roads will be straightened and we will be with them time without end may that day hasten its appearance and may we hastened to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic it is in this first age did not listen to the spirit and see it listened to men but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit and that day of gross darkness the light will reach turn by the pure word and they will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah I I believe I'm looking at some of them I mean that they obey the spur because you're a spurt breath witness with him his spirit is the word right so a spurt brace would assume that we are the sons of God because a spurt agrees with all the word hallelujah so she will obey the spirit and you're glad to obey his spirit you look at see as I said make the valley full of ditches how much water do you want people people want the blessing but they don't want the sacrifice but if you really want the blessing you'll give the sacrifice hallelujah that we can walk with the apostles of trod it's worth it I tell you amen so they will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ and we have been restored back to everything the first church had right before the before the Ephesian Age started and I think 1865 whatever it was there was a period of time where the church hadn't begun to fall right we're being restored back to that hallelujah amen we have received a spirit of adoption or placing in the body amen now as I said this is the place or the position that man fell from the beginning now Adam and Eve before the fall down owners Adam Wright Eve was only named Eve after the fall which means the mother of all living right so they all caught by one name they were in perfect harmony before the fall and they had dominion over all the earth that was before the fall and this is what we are now hallelujah this is this is who we are now there's harmony between the bride and Christ right there is a harmony we have our battles but that that that doesn't correspond to a tension between our us and our Savior right sometimes we you know we need to demarcate very clearly I'm in a trial that doesn't mean your connection with God's not there that doesn't mean that relationships under strain right that actually means relationships good hallelujah Amen so now we need to eat to rejoice my Bible tells me he broke down the middle wall of partition he abolished in his flesh the enmity a lot of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace that's what my Bible says about me what he did then he might reconcile both under God and one body by the cross having slain the enmity they're buying and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father hallelujah we're no more strangers or citizens but fellow citizens with the Saints of the household of God that's what my Bible tells me see so the Lord tells me there's nothing between me and you right we've become one he you know the Apostle Paul speaks about the mystery of Christ and his church's husband and wife - becoming one flesh amen and we're living out that minute at that mystery right so we're one so they're in perfect harmony when you die to yourself you you enter into perfect harmony with God right because it's no more how do you know you're redeemed you no longer once your own will because you surrendered your will over to him right the second Adam Jesus Jesus Christ manifested everything the first Adam was he had power over nature he also showed us God by having power over the devil and all sickness and death itself and they were and so as Adam and Eve were called Adam before the fall so Christ and His Word bright is called the name of the bridegroom Jesus Christ amen in the bride only does his will amen yes sir amen so now we've come to a place where we are joint heirs with him now see here in 1st Corinthians 11 and 7 for a man indeed ought to not cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man so now just like in a natural marriage the woman is the revelation of the man so really what what the man what is in the man's hat will be in the woman will be manifested in her if there one right so now we are the glory so so the woman is the glory of the man so so how we treat our wives husbands I wish is she really our glory what do we think of ourselves right and so now if that is just naturally that's why when people put their wives out like prostitutes on the street dressed up as the world they're not really considering that their wife is the glory as they glory right because God doesn't want to share our ice with no body why would we share our wives with anybody on the street because to look upon a woman lust after her she sure you've committed adultery in your heart already right so if God saying no I'll not share her with anything he doesn't want to share you with anyone right he's not a yo-yo yo-yo he doesn't say the devil well you can have wrong winds they are all heaven for the rest of the week that's not how it works he is jealous of you with a godly jealousy he's jealous over you he's protective hallelujah he doesn't want the devil to handle you in any way now if that is you know if that is the heavenly how much more should that that should be they'll be manifested in the earthly right if God is as I said of God if you know redemption husbands fathers then that redemption will be manifested through you to your family right you'll want to lift them up not not tread them down lift them up Oh God reach through me to my children reach through me to my wife then that the revelation I have of you will become manifested in them Pulu yeah that's why it's such a danger we don't want to learn someone's revelation we want to receive the same revelation they have right you don't want to learn my revelation or even the prophets revelation you want to receive the same real revelation he had you following me right we can learn it's like it's like the Apostle Paul this is the revelation of Jesus Christ many people just learn the revelation we don't want to just learn it we want the same God that gave them the revelation gave give us the revelation of the word same thing with the prophets message Amen sanella that's how we should be so the woman is the glory of the man so the bride is the glory of the Lord Jesus this is glory this is praise this is what he's made hallelujah so now if the woman is the glory of the man then the woman will not be beaten down brother so the vision of us of a woman that looked like his mom but wasn't his mom and a man with a three-sided club that looked like his damn it wasn't as dead and every time the woman tried to get back up this man would beat her down with the club for that three-sided club that trinitarian spirit Club because because that woman and the vision was that was the bride wanting to rise up and she couldn't rise up cuz that spirit was beating her down but then he said no you got to deal with me and face my faith muscles built out hallelujah and then and that spirit had to steep back right should be the same thing with us friends I mean we don't want to beat our families don't want to lift them up hallelujah that's why I see father's don't provoke children to anger at least they'd be discouraged right they get frustrated I can never please this man therefore I can never please God so what's the point we don't want to be like that we need wisdom I mean so the woman is the glory of the man hallelujah so now the bride is the glory of Jesus Christ this is what he thinks of you and the citizen from desperations he sees in the Holy Ghost as the token that the blood has been applied because it follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption see that was the purpose of us coming that's what he followed in every age every age he has followed that to see that it's brought forth and they could not be perfect this is speaking of the whole whole bride through seven Church ages every age has followed that to see what it's brought forth and they could not be made perfect without us and now the entire Holy Spirit visits the church making God and human flesh as he did before Sodom the burning there which was a type then Abraham he appeared to him and all the things that he hasn't done down through the ages of the church age he is now doing back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire word and in the last days the seven seals being open was to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great body of the bride that them who lived back there were was not perfect until this church be perfected this bride group and the last days to bring them in and all together be take upsie it's how important is for us to come to our position right because when we come to our position in Christ then now come out of the grave the life in you will bring them forth hallelujah isn't that wonderful you say well Lord I can't do it he doesn't want you to do it he wants to do it you just gotta yield yourself to his word to his spirit and it will manifest in you I mean if you've been cooled out Egypt we're not here just to die in a wilderness we call the garbage Jordan and not just go over Jordan but take the whole land hallelujah take our entire inheritance the token Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit is among us we should reverence that we can't humble ourselves enough taking off your shoes you're getting on your knees wouldn't expel it wouldn't satisfy it wouldn't suffice it but a life that now brings forth the fruit of the Spirit now what is the fruit of the Spirit see love joy and peace longsuffering so forth holy that's why it's so incredible he's among us Jesus Christ is among us to manifest his word in us hallelujah now Daniel Daniel was seeing when these things would be and now we will daniel was seeing when these things were because he saw until the time of the end and he and and here's desiring he's and and he's told many shall sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn away and they didn't turn away to righteousness as stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased so Daniel Caesars vision to the timely anyone's and see when it's going to be God says it's sealed up but it will be made known and the time of the end where many shall run to and fro travel around the world are we living that day don't we and knowledge shall be increased where are we from the last you go back a hundred years world will one finishes you know they just had those rudiment you know technology was very basic narrower in space it wasn't that long from you know from from 1918 it wasn't that long till people were in space technology advanced and such Gracie's and this time the book will come open now it says that and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament now of the firm permanent as it speaks of not only the sky but also the heavens and what's that that shows is the brightness up there is the Stars so those that are and the stars we know the stars represent you it's also God's first Bible right so all those stars have to be in position that that it it speaks the Bible right so every and it speaks of your position in Christ so what so those stars represent you and a falling star attracts a lot of attention but it's falling but those that are in their position all those that are together they they speak the plan of redemption right so those that are those that are wise show-cell shall shine as them right so they come into their position in Christ and they're now manifesting what they should be in Christ the word you follow me so those that are wise and we know there's no that's not worldly wisdom that's god-given wisdom he's saying that in that time the book will be open the inheritance everything Adam lost will come open he says this again in Daniel 12 and 8 I know these may be foundational but here we are and I heard but I understood not then said I o my lord what shall be the end of these things he said go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand hallelujah trust you've been purified and made white and tried hallelujah the trial of our faith Amen so he's speaking of a future time now here we come to the time of the end John we understand represents the Bride of Christ he comes down through seven Church Ages and he's taken up to a door and him and he's opened up into an eternal realm and then this place he sees he sees God on the throne and the four and twenty elders around the throw and the cherubs I mean yeah yeah you're the cherubims and he sees in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book sealed on the backside sealed with seven seals this is everything Adam lost right there's all symbolic was everything Adam lost and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon so no man was seen to be found worthy all the prophets were there the redeemed her around there but no one's there that's found to be worthy and here's John who laid on Christ's bosom you know saw him being take away to be crucified saw him resurrected but now he's weeping because he knows if no man has found worthy to take this book everything's in jeopardy right this book represents you well cuz when brother Browns preaching in the breach he goes he goes to bow is taking Ruth amen any-any saying that this act is the same as that act where bow is a redeems Ruth marries her hallelujah redeems her from who would I hurt then now now she comes in Amen it becomes part of the promise of God by uniting herself with Boaz now she's part of the economy of Israel hallelujah so now brother Graham says this is the most sublime act in all the scripture the Lamb taking the book hallelujah because this is God this is this is the lamb because now what let's just let's just read as I wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders he had to be weak not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of spirits of God that went forth into all the earth so he looks again he sees this lamb appear hallelujah now here he comes and this is why it's so it's so important Jesus purchased our salvation but then he purchased but now it comes to claim right and this is what is happening in this day thank God our Lord Jesus is laying claim on his bride and taking her and placing her in her rightful position as joint heirs with him right and that's why this is such an important scene because now without the lamb with that our Lord taking the book loosing the seals opening the inheritance back to Adam's fallen race the whole things in jeopardy hallelujah so now here he comes he steps forth and he's found to be worthy to open the book how Lucy everything that Adam lost remember he he was God over the earth but by trying to save his wife and falling amen he forfeited as God ship over the earth and now Satan is God over the earth right the god of this evil age the scripture says he is amen because and so that title deed couldn't go into the hands of Satan so it went back to the original owner and it's been waiting it's been waiting Amen but then now there comes a time rel Lord Jesus redeemed us he's been interceding and he's still in the city on our behalf right he's still in the city on our behalf and then now it comes to claim what belongs to him and that's why it's so glorious witness word came your way I trust that still means something to you when the message came your way and it echoes something spoke to you on here that's a lamb saying you belong to me I'm calling your name I mean your name's in the book and I'm calling your name out of the book you say well he never verbally said my name but something spoke to you the word spoke to your soul hallelujah and that's God laying claim on you hallelujah amen so he prevailed to open the book to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld so step forth amen and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders the four beasts four and twenty else fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints now they could release these priests because you go read about Adams lineage and you know in Genesis it goes down a few says then man begin to call upon the name of the Lord because they're calling on God God when are you going to restore Eden when you're going to take away the grip of Satan when it will get me back and eternity again earlier but now is the time now is the time that's why we can rejoice soon and very soon we're going to see the soon and very soon we're gonna walk on streets of gold hallelujah soon and very soon it's all done now is the season and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by their blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation hallelujah and I trust that that's that's your song we've been redeemed amen he's taken the book he's loose the seals this is important amen brother Brahim season in the breach between the seven churches seven seals is oh my the four footed title deed is now in the hands of the original owner Almighty God the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when Adam four footed it when when Satan's dirty hands could not take it so went back to its original owner God himself we're gonna find it just a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed oh it makes me feel religious the title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam four-footed up for wisdom and set of faith and went back to the hands of the original owner Almighty God what a great thing all right waiting what's it doing it's in the hands of God waiting for redemptions claims he made a way for redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see where we're getting to now let's watch this fellow sitting on the throne all right waiting for redemptions claims its Redemption what is this book of Redemption this title deed abstract all did you say abstract what does abstract mean means it searched all the way back to its beginning like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sins been confessed and fall into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract straight right back to the crater again you become a son of God abstract title deed is held in the hands of the Almighty oh my it's Redemption means all legal possession of all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my what that ought to do to a born-again Christian it's legal position to that abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost or whatever brother the possession of that deed Adam could not meet the required of redemption after he found he lost it he had sending it cipro himself from God was on this side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he couldn't do it because he needed Redemption himself he could not do it but the law required a kinsman redeemer the law of God required a kinsman redeemer you want to market down kinsman redeemer we find it in Leviticus 25 we don't have time to thoroughly search this cause you know each text would take your night seat but God's law received a substitute now what if God had not offered to make a substitute but love constrained him to do it that man was without a way back there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of God met this kinsman redeemer and the person of Jesus Christ law required at Grace met its requirements or Amazing Grace how sweet the sound God's law required an innocent substitute and who was innocent every man was born sexual after sex everyone and the only one that wasn't had full foot the rights to eternal life to be the king of the earth oh when I think of that scripture for thou has redeemed us back to God we may reign to be kings and priests upon the earth oh my what the kinsman redeemer oh what a story we would have here notice the law required a kinsman redeemer to redeem a lost substance grace met this requirement and the person of Jesus Christ a kinsman must be born of the human race hallelujah so the law required it grace provided in the person of Jesus Christ our Lord amen when we could not get back he came down Daniel was looking it was sealed in his time now it's come to a time when it's open hallelujah and then we see this book now is taken and John is there and he sees a mighty angel descending in revelations 10 and before revelations 10 you see the bottomless pit opens up smoke comes the devil's come out of hell I mean but as that's happening and a mighty angel comes down upon the earth with an open book hallelujah so this is the book that they that that the Lamb took in Revelations 5 now that same God has come down upon the earth with that book open and he cries out with a loud voice as a lion Roth and he cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders uttered their voices I was about to write it so John heard it he was about to write it down I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that there are now and the earth and the things that there are now and the sea and the things that and there are that there should be time no longer and that means there shall be no more delay so remember this is all symbolic but this is Christ's coming down memory read on Wednesday that God's final move will be a greater outpouring of the Holy Spirit right so this mighty angel descending is the Holy Spirit coming down Christ and his fullness right the Holy Spirit feels not in portion like in Wesley's day or Zeus's Street day or Pentecostal day or Luther's day this is the fullness of God coming down into the church again brother Brennan see the Son of Man will be manifested in the church body hallelujah so now here he comes the anointing comes down with an open book so here's the title deed that of everything Adam lost God has come down to unite that deed to a people right that they'd become one with that word that that word will be manifested in them hallelujah hope that means something to you I mean just like Moses they're on Mount Sinai he receives the law the purpose of that law was that they would God's their land and they become one with that land right see here he gums and then it comes down the mountain he preaches that word Caleb and Joshua heard that word they became one with that word Caleb was now burnt up I won't mine here it's give me my mountain when am I going to be in my possession when am I going to manifest this law that came to me hallelujah that's the same thing with you and I friends I trust I mean when the word comes open you know this became a new book to me over ten years ago I was reading it and it was and once upon a time it was Paul was writing to someone and this was to someone else but then it became a personal book it was Peter writing to me and whenever I turn it's actually I'm writing to you personally today hallelujah so wasn't someone else's covered testimony it was now mine they made with me hallelujah so now it's very important you say so so John he heard these seven thunders but he was told not to write it but they were sealed up right at not right seal up those things see even John he heard it but he has told don't write this because there comes a time he says but in the days of the voice so when are these things gonna be but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so these seven thunders just like Jesus he's setting upon it as his father glorify thy name and a voice spoke from him and I've glorified I'll glorify it again some heard the voice the others heard a thunder so the thunders of the voice of God not interpreted it's all in the scripture right so it's not these seven thunders not saying that's added to the word it's in the word well you've got to come a time when it comes open when it becomes plain and brother has asked the question are the seven thunders the revelation 7 seals he says yes they are yslow sunders were we're held in the seals when the seals were loosed then the thunders were loosed the voice of God was loosed upon the earth right and now has been searching for hearts amen to come and manifest and then that word becomes flesh and her people hallelujah amen and that's why it gives us power to actually overcome the enemy I mean because there's always the question well if we've been restored back what do we have that that the first church age did it they didn't have the seals open they didn't need that power right because when God releases his word he releases a power in that word hallelujah and so now when he releases that word amen it gives the people power when they receive it by faith that gives them overcoming power to overcome the conditions of their day hallelujah so here we are down he says now he says when the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished should be completed as he hath declared it to servants the prophets now we know that God doesn't send a heavenly angel to preach God uses man while he always uses man right because God doesn't change his method he says it Amos 3:7 I'll do nothing until revealed to my servants the prophets first right so this the seventh angel is an earthly angel earthly messenger so the days of his voice then the mystery of God will be completed will be finished and that's why brother Browns ministry was recorded Rakas the days of his voice and the days of his voice the mystery gotta be finished because God will unfold the word to a people as they walk with Him and they begin to see the mystery of God has been unfolded in this day hallelujah so now here we are but this is not the end of it because now we're told that's just like the lamb why did Jesus died and died for himself he died for you he came to redeem you to take you back into your place right and so now the whole purpose God's whole purpose of redemption his focus is you God wants you in your place hallelujah and it's not subservient right when God calls people it's not that you know it's like a you know it's like a wife their position is not just chief cook and bottle washer now that went real quiet oh they're in their place no that's just not it if we're joint is right if what I am in Christ I'm joint heirs with him so that should be reflected down into the family you want to see something that supernatural you see a family that's actually in its order under the Word of God that's supernatural that's incredible and so now so so so now woman in her place is not just a cook in a bottle-washer right God doesn't just use a scissor now do these little things and you know no he has fellowship with us he whispers his love secrets in our ear he lifts us up to where he is I mean he actually you know he gives us burdens he shares his heart with us did he have a burden or God move I want to see Souls come in heal this person God sharing his burden with you right God sharing his burden he's not just using you as a server not telling what's going on he he shares this burden with you and should be the same thing with our wives they actually have a spiritual what do you call it input yeah I mean they share spiritual and put into the family right not just that cooking a bottle-washer then your spiritual input their there their view actually matters right that's like that you know we we're all part of the body of Christ as this I feel this is coming out okay right but we shouldn't tread down our our families lift them up amen so now God speaks but then also you see here but that's not the end of it and the voice which I heard from heaven speak to me again Saint go and take the little book which is open which standing upon me I'm the hand of the angel which standing upon the sea and upon the earth and he went give me the little book and he said take it and eat it up so now these people john represents the bride you got to become one with the word you can't just sympathize with the message oh that's what that he believes mommy believes this is okay now you're going to become one with it you become one with Jesus Christ and living word right and then now John takes the book he eats it up and as in his belly it's bitter but as mouth that sweetest honey and he did that and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings now we know in history John did not after his on the Isle of Patmos he went to pasture the church at Ephesus and there he died so he didn't fulfill this but this is actually the fulfillment the commission to the bride in those last days you got to become one with the book right become one with everything Adam lost you must become one with it and you got to speak it forth you have to prophesy again you were to speak the contents of the book I mean that's why it's important we should talk about what God has done what God has given us hallelujah if I'm a journeyer with Christ I should talk about it that's why you got to respond I mean with God's looking for a response from you hallelujah so we're going to speak the contents of the book and so now that is more than just repeating what brother Bram said though that is good but it's the life that was in the Lord Jesus lives out of you that's how it has to be Amen that thou must prophesy again so we have the Great Commission now right to go prophesy before many peoples nations tongues and kings there's the bride around the world see everything Adam lost has to become manifested spoken of and the stay an hour Amen that should make us happy Allu you so now we're living in this day now Moses now I'm just gonna it's gonna wrap up with us now Moses in Deuteronomy for we ask this question for us now of the days that were passed which were before thee since the day that God created man upon the earth and asked from one side of heaven to the other whether thou has seen any such a thing as great thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou has heard and live or hath God si to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations by signs by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes and to thee it was showed that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God and there's none else beside him out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon the earth he showed thee as great fire and thou hearest his words out of the midst of the fire and because he loved by father's written he chose their seed after them and brought thee out of out in his sight with mighty power with his mighty power out of Egypt to drive out nations from before the greater and mightier than thou art to bring the end to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day so you st. consider heavy as ever such a great thing being upon the earth amen and I just want to say well Moses God always gets greater has he ever been a day like this day has he ever been a time upon the earth where the people of God are not looking for something future Wednesday going to be a full restoration we're living the time of the full restoration we're living in the time of the full redemption right we're living in the time where soon and very soon these bodies could be changed right because that quickening power is coming to us of his holy spirit hallelujah has there ever been a day where God we've heard the voice out of the mists of the fire where the pillar of fire has come back among the church again that's why I was photographed in many places hallelujah that we've heard the voice out of the pillar of fire God took a prophet spoke his word out of that vessel hallelujah amen has he ever been a day like this there's never been a day like this this is the greatest day to be alive you may wouldn't have been neat to be there and and walk with Moses it would have been good what about the days when Jesus was in Basil's flesh that would have been wonderful but this is a better day this is a greater day because death is going to be swallowed up in victory in this day at the last Trump hallelujah this is a far better day to be alive so now we are living we are living in a day Amen that we that the Bride of Christ we are we are his purchased possession Amen that we all received an inheritance or an airship I mean that's why you've got to look at yourself as I said on Wednesday and some people chuckled when you look at yourself in the mirror do you say I do you look at yourself and think you're a masterpiece and God's eyes I'm not talking about the natural person the world puts everything on this the veneer of this flesh and how perfect it is God's looking for character God's looking for himself in a people God's number of people that's been called out having sanctified have been redeemed of being transformed by the Spirit of God having placed in the body of Christ that's what God's looking for and I trust when you look at yourself the merese a god I'm one of your masterpieces and a masterpiece is a piece of the master hallelujah we're part of him amen the bride is a piece of the master right hallelujah so I trust when you look at me say when you look at yourself say Lord I'm your workmanship that's it should make you proud oh I'm the bride know you if you really think you're something yeah you know a brother Brahim says we should pass around a bucket of water put your hole in the water pull it out see if you can find the hole amen that's the test of how important we are in ourselves you ever find the hole right if God did it yeah I mean you know because he's the important one so if we think we're something with nothing he's everything I mean but we should be we're made to the praise of his glory and life's to be Lord you're so amazing you're so incredible you'll redeem me you've you've watched me you've given me a sure
