[23:28] and um
[23:30] you most of you would know we now and
[23:33] then we write a few songs here
[23:35] and then we generally have a bit of a
[23:37] practice that when we have a new one we
[23:39] sing it as an item first so this is a
[23:41] this is a new song
[23:43] um that we've got and
[23:46] it's actually more of like a bit of a
[23:48] choir song you know when we when we go
[23:50] to the conventions you know we kind of
[23:52] do a bit of a we usually do some sort of
[23:55] a group item this is more like one of
[23:57] those
[23:58] so it's like a it's kind of been written
[24:00] more as a sort of happy choir group song
[24:03] so maybe maybe once we learn it good
[24:05] later on we can the next camp we can
[24:07] maybe get some
[24:09] get your amazing voices involved and do
[24:11] some do a bit of cunning
[24:13] um workmanship on it with all the with

[49:33] we're going to read two down to verse 39
[49:35] Familia piece of scripture I think but
[49:38] um he says here now in the last in the
[49:41] last day of that great um that great day
[49:43] of the feast Jesus stood and cried
[49:45] saying if any man thirst let him come
[49:47] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[49:49] me as the scripture hath said out of his
[49:52] belly shall flow rivers of Living Water
[49:55] but this uh spake he of the spirit which
[49:58] they that believe on him should receive
[50:00] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[50:02] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[50:05] amen let's just bow hits in a word of
[50:07] prayer this morning if you want to be
[50:08] remembered and prayers you want to raise
[50:09] your hand to the Lord amen dear Lord
[50:12] Jesus you see all the hands that are
[50:14] raised Lord we're so thankful that your
[50:15] word is ever true Lord and truly Lord
[50:17] that was more than a song Lord you are
[50:19] changing us oh God we thank you Lord
[50:22] that Lord your word resounds with your
[50:23] own heart and that's the that's what I
[50:25] want to catch this morning Lord not just
[50:27] to learn about you Lord but to Lord to
[50:30] to to meet with you to have a real
[50:32] experience with you oh God that your
[50:34] word would become part of us Lord that
[50:36] would walk out of these doors changed
[50:37] and renewed in the spirit Lord may you
[50:40] grant that I pray we just ask dear God
[50:42] may you just move Among Us Lord May
[50:44] touch every life and Lord we just want
[50:46] to get ourselves out of the way that you
[50:48] can have preeminence in our lives that
[50:50] you can do what you want to do so take
[50:52] control of every heart of every Spirit
[50:53] here for your glory Lord we love you we
[50:56] thank you Lord we can be gathered this
[50:58] morning pray you bless each one Lord and
[51:00] also those who couldn't make it today
[51:01] Grant it dear God we lord as we've read
[51:04] your word we need you the great author
[51:05] to come once again and make it live
[51:07] that's you're the one we want to see oh
[51:09] God so may you granted in Jesus Christ's
[51:11] name amen amen God bless you friends you
[51:14] may have your seats this morning I've
[51:15] been going through a bit of a kind of a
[51:17] series about the power in God's pardon
[51:19] and Grace and and I just want to kind of
[51:22] continue on in this uh theme a little
[51:24] bit here but you know it's amazing where
[51:26] you know you read about the um you know
[51:28] you read John chapter seven we and we
[51:30] won't read all of it but you know just
[51:32] to save time we're just going to cover
[51:33] it very briefly how it's amazing how you
[51:36] know Christianity is not just to sit
[51:37] around and debate and talk about who you
[51:39] think Jesus is where you know it's more
[51:41] than just arguing Doctrine or talking
[51:43] about well I feel the word is like this
[51:45] or I feel the word is like that or I
[51:47] think it means this because you know
[51:48] they would you know all the Jews were
[51:50] sitting around they were debating and
[51:51] talking well you know I Think Jesus is a
[51:53] good man or I think he's a bad man I
[51:55] think he's full of a devil I think he's
[51:56] Messiah and you know they were talking
[51:58] about all these things but they were
[51:59] really missing the point of him being
[52:01] there because the Lord said you know
[52:03] when you come unto me when you really
[52:05] believe on me out of as a scripture say
[52:07] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[52:09] Living Water where so it's more than
[52:10] just a confession of Faith but there's a
[52:12] real change in life where God would come
[52:15] and step into the person would come and
[52:16] live in us and out of us would flow the
[52:19] Holy Ghost amen so it's very important
[52:21] that we that we that we um uh under not
[52:24] just understand this but we experience
[52:26] this where our lives are here to
[52:28] actually bless one another you know
[52:29] every gift and every life is not for the
[52:32] person who has that gift it's for the
[52:34] body of Christ Hallelujah so you know I
[52:37] just you know I'm just so thankful that
[52:39] you know he would people would debate
[52:40] about him and and talk about him many
[52:42] different ways but he's really saying no
[52:44] you're missing the point if you really
[52:45] believe on me out of your belly shall
[52:48] flow rivers of Living Water I mean as I
[52:50] would say in Isaiah 32 would say behold
[52:52] the king shall reign in righteousness
[52:54] and and princes shall rule in judgment
[52:56] and a man shall be as a hiding place
[52:58] from from the wind and as a covet from
[53:01] The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry
[53:03] place as the shadows of a great rock in
[53:06] a weary land and the eyes of them that
[53:08] shall see him shall not be dim and the
[53:10] ears of them that here shall hearken the
[53:12] hearts also of the rest shall understand
[53:14] knowledge and the tongue of the stammers
[53:16] shall be ready to speak plainly I mean
[53:20] so we live in this kind of hour where
[53:22] where where this is no longer a prophecy
[53:24] but but it's here in manifestation in
[53:26] our lives where where a man shall be a
[53:28] hiding place from the wind from the from
[53:30] the cool blasts and you know cold blast
[53:33] of the devil you know where a man shall
[53:35] be this hiding place we know this hiding
[53:36] place is our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[53:39] where he would be a place you know
[53:40] hiding place from the wind and his
[53:42] rivers of water in a dry place you know
[53:44] I don't know if you've ever been in a
[53:46] situation where you can't just turn on
[53:47] the tap and water you know water doesn't
[53:49] run out when you turn on the tap you
[53:51] know water becomes very valuable it
[53:53] becomes a very precious commodity when
[53:55] you can't receive it it's easy to you
[53:57] know here we can just turn on the tap
[53:58] it'll just run until well it'll just
[54:00] keep running running because we get more
[54:01] rain than probably we you know get rid
[54:03] of but you know when you when you're in
[54:05] a place like when we're in bushback
[54:06] Ridge Brother Andy and I in December you
[54:08] know there'll be times where there'd
[54:09] just be no water running and you need to
[54:11] try and wash your hands you get bottles
[54:12] of water and yeah but it became very
[54:13] precious just a little bit of water that
[54:15] if it was coming out of the tap you just
[54:17] take it for granted but if it's in a
[54:18] bottle well it's it's an important thing
[54:20] and so so in a dry in a dry place you
[54:24] know he'd be a great rock in a weary
[54:25] land where where this word weary means
[54:28] it's a faint or a thirsty or a weary
[54:29] land now we live in a weary land it's a
[54:32] very dry you know people are fainting
[54:34] their hearts are fainting for fear amen
[54:36] we know mental illness has has
[54:38] skyrocketed these last couple of decades
[54:40] especially in the west is because man is
[54:43] trying to trying to find a satisfying
[54:45] place in their own ability in their own
[54:47] strength but they cannot find it you
[54:50] know there's no peace Amen in this world
[54:51] because the Prince of Peace has been
[54:53] turned down I mean but those who have
[54:55] received the prince of peace they have a
[54:56] peace that passes all understanding amen
[54:58] we can be living in the greatest trial
[55:00] of our life but if he is our Rock if he
[55:02] is our anchor I mean we can stand as
[55:04] sure as he'll stand not because we're
[55:06] depending upon ourselves but because
[55:07] we're depending upon him I mean that's
[55:09] the main thing if you know if if he
[55:11] really is our foundation if his word is
[55:13] our everything amen then then we can
[55:15] stand in every situation Hallelujah I'm
[55:18] so thankful we have a god greater than
[55:19] ourselves greater than the devil greater
[55:21] than anything he can throw at us we can
[55:23] stand amen because he stood amen that's
[55:26] the main thing you know it's amazing
[55:27] where you know we can we can look in the
[55:30] word of God and we can look at all the
[55:31] promises of God and you know
[55:34] everything in the Bible and the message
[55:36] you know that you're you know that's a
[55:37] promise to the bride Jesus died for us
[55:39] to receive
[55:40] right he did not just receive that word
[55:42] he didn't sorry did not just die the
[55:44] word receive forgiveness of sins though
[55:46] we have but there's Divine Promises of
[55:48] God that he died that we would possess
[55:50] amen and so it's very important when we
[55:53] look into these things we think how are
[55:54] we ever going to possess these things
[55:56] because it's amazing how man can can can
[55:58] go straight into the attempting with
[56:00] their own ability to possess the
[56:02] promises of God you know but we
[56:04] understand that it's not by our power or
[56:06] by might that we can ever obtain any
[56:08] promise it's by his spirit amen as the
[56:11] Apostle Paul when he would be speaking
[56:13] to the Galatians we know that the
[56:15] galatian church they go into a
[56:16] legalistic phase they're trying to
[56:18] because of the people weren't fully
[56:19] converted they're trying to bring an old
[56:21] way of life into the New and Living Way
[56:23] trying to bring the law into Walking
[56:25] with God and and and the Apostle Paul
[56:27] straightened that all out in the in the
[56:29] epistle to the Galatians and he comes
[56:31] down to a conclusion where he had saying
[56:33] Galatians 6 it say for in Christ Jesus
[56:36] neither circumcision availeth anything
[56:38] nor uncircumcision but a new creature I
[56:41] mean so it's not it's not keeping the
[56:43] law or your own ability or not doing or
[56:45] just being it's not being legal or
[56:46] liberal that are veileth or gives you
[56:48] power overcoming ability but it's being
[56:51] a new creation in Jesus Christ I mean
[56:53] that's the thing that avails that's the
[56:54] thing that causes us to overcome is when
[56:57] God takes our old nature and it dies out
[56:59] amen then he steps in and makes a new
[57:02] creation because remember we are not a
[57:04] patched up people I mean we are not a
[57:06] reformed people this is not a
[57:08] Reformation this is a transformation a
[57:10] restoration of a people back to the
[57:12] original faith of the book of Acts amen
[57:14] where God would live in a people amen
[57:16] walk and then manifest as word I mean
[57:18] that's what this message has come to
[57:19] achieve I mean that God would be
[57:21] restored back in the hearts and lives of
[57:23] men and women that he would his word
[57:25] would have preeminence in every life and
[57:28] I'm so thankful we can give him first
[57:29] place amen we don't just push him off in
[57:32] a corner somewhere but we give him first
[57:34] place in our life now you look we're
[57:36] going to look in the description see the
[57:37] benefit of doing that right because
[57:39] Christianity a lot of you know people
[57:41] tells people there's all the things you
[57:42] cannot do when you become a Christian
[57:44] all the things you lose but I think
[57:46] actually it's all the things you gain
[57:48] amen what do you gain well you can be
[57:50] free Of Heartache you can be free of
[57:52] Sorrow free of pain you'll be free of
[57:54] the fear of death amen free of the wrath
[57:56] of God you can be free of the devil's
[57:58] influence and control in your life you
[58:00] can actually be free Hallelujah not just
[58:02] free you know as brother Isaac said you
[58:04] know people say they're free but what
[58:05] are they free from
[58:07] right because some people say well I'm
[58:08] no longer a Christian I'm free what are
[58:10] you free from well you're you're free
[58:12] from the protection of God that's one
[58:14] thing you're free from the Rapture I'm
[58:16] free I can do what I want but I say I'm
[58:18] actually the freest person a Believer is
[58:20] free amen like the Apostle Paul would
[58:22] stand before king of gripper and chains
[58:24] and he was actually the freest person in
[58:26] that whole courtroom the king wasn't
[58:28] free the other people weren't free he
[58:29] was free why because he met God on the
[58:32] road to Damascus his life was
[58:33] transformed I mean he may have been in
[58:35] physical change but spiritually he was
[58:37] free hallelujah amen there's no Darkness
[58:39] over him no sin death sorrow pain it was
[58:42] all gone why because he made a new
[58:43] creature in Christ as the same thing
[58:45] with us today we can have that same kind
[58:47] of experience amen where God steps out
[58:49] of History touches our hearts changes
[58:52] Our Lives of the person we once were
[58:53] we're no more because that person's dead
[58:55] in the blood of Jesus Christ and we're
[58:57] walking on with God Amen so it's a new
[58:59] creation that's what avails amen it's so
[59:01] important I mean because as I was saying
[59:03] that it's that it's not just you know
[59:05] it's not just being pardoned from sin
[59:07] see Jesus died on Calvary not just to
[59:10] take our sins away he did that that he
[59:11] would step into us and live in our lives
[59:13] amen so it's one thing to say yes he
[59:15] died on the calvary for me but are you a
[59:17] beneficiary of his resurrection I mean
[59:19] because if he's alive amen Because He
[59:21] Lives we live also amen that his Spirit
[59:23] comes into us and transforms Our Lives
[59:26] now as I was saying before but you know
[59:28] before I went down that kind of Segway
[59:29] you know there's always a question how
[59:31] can we receive the promises of God how
[59:34] can we see the manifested now Abraham
[59:37] before he became Abraham asked God the
[59:39] same question
[59:40] where God would come down in Genesis
[59:43] chapter 15 and he would he would you
[59:45] know God would begin to tell him what
[59:47] he's going to do
[59:50] about about Abraham and Sarah would have
[59:52] the promised son and you know they would
[59:54] they would inherit and this would be
[59:55] their inheritance the promised land and
[59:57] all these different things and you know
[59:59] and then in Genesis 15 and 8 uh Abraham
[1:00:01] said to the Lord Lord God whereby shall
[1:00:03] I know that I shall inherit it so so
[1:00:06] he's because he's saying God I mean
[1:00:08] Abraham is saying to God you know but
[1:00:10] but this this um elieza of Damascus you
[1:00:12] know he's my Aaron you know I don't you
[1:00:15] know you know I don't have a son and
[1:00:16] houses how's this going to be continued
[1:00:18] down because you have told me that in me
[1:00:20] all nations shall be blessed and you
[1:00:22] know how's this going to happen and you
[1:00:23] know and then and then and so he asked
[1:00:25] the question whereby shall I know I
[1:00:27] shall inherit it that's a good question
[1:00:28] I think you know when God gives a
[1:00:30] promise we should be asking well how am
[1:00:31] I going to receive this promise how's it
[1:00:33] really going to be manifested in my life
[1:00:35] because you know there's a lot of
[1:00:36] promises in here Hallelujah and every
[1:00:39] promise of God has to be divinely given
[1:00:41] but then how's it going to be done and
[1:00:43] then so the Lord asks answers him this
[1:00:45] question he would tell him to and he'd
[1:00:48] say unto him in Genesis 15 9 maybe you
[1:00:50] want to throw it up Talia there and he
[1:00:52] said unto him take me a take me and hear
[1:00:54] from three years old and if she go to
[1:00:56] three years old and a ram of three years
[1:00:58] old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon
[1:01:00] and he took unto them all uh all these
[1:01:02] and divided them in the midst and laid
[1:01:04] each piece one against another but the
[1:01:07] birds he divided are divided he not and
[1:01:09] when the fowls came down upon the
[1:01:11] carcasses Abraham drove them away and
[1:01:14] when the sun was going down a deep sleep
[1:01:16] pardon me fell upon Abram and lower
[1:01:18] horror of great Darkness fell upon him
[1:01:20] and he said unto Abraham sure nervous
[1:01:23] surely that thy seed
[1:01:25] shall be a stranger in a land that's not
[1:01:26] theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[1:01:28] shall afflict them 400 years and also
[1:01:30] that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[1:01:32] judge and afterwards shall they come out
[1:01:34] with a great substance and thou shall go
[1:01:36] to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be
[1:01:39] buried in a good old age but in the
[1:01:41] fourth generation
[1:01:42] they shall come hither again for the
[1:01:44] iniquity the amorites is not yet full
[1:01:46] and it came to pass it when the sun went
[1:01:48] down it was dark Behold a a smoking
[1:01:51] furnace and a burning lamp that passed
[1:01:53] between those pieces so God came down
[1:01:54] and consumed that sacrifice so God is
[1:01:57] telling because Abraham's saying how am
[1:01:58] I going to inherit this and God is
[1:02:00] basically saying I'm going to join
[1:02:02] myself to you in sacrifice that's
[1:02:04] exactly how you're going to inherit This
[1:02:05] Promise it's not going to be you that's
[1:02:07] going to do it but but by these
[1:02:09] sacrifices I'm enjoining myself to you
[1:02:11] Abraham that through me you will possess
[1:02:14] this promise now because this word
[1:02:16] whereby uh the definition is actually by
[1:02:18] which way or method so so Abraham is
[1:02:21] asking God by which way a method shall I
[1:02:23] know that I shall inherit it so what is
[1:02:25] the way or the method that I'll know
[1:02:27] that this promise is actually mine you
[1:02:28] know how am I actually going to know
[1:02:30] that this promise is not just some nice
[1:02:31] idea that's instagramable that you know
[1:02:34] that I can put on the fridge but how do
[1:02:35] I know it's actually it's going to
[1:02:37] happen it's going to be a reality it's
[1:02:39] going to be manifested in my life and
[1:02:40] God says well take these sacrifices and
[1:02:43] he was showing Abraham that he was going
[1:02:44] to join himself to God I mean join
[1:02:47] Abraham to himself by these sacrifices
[1:02:49] now this is so vitally important because
[1:02:52] if you really know the Lord if he's
[1:02:54] really joined to you by Sacrifice by
[1:02:57] Calvary amen you're going to realize
[1:02:59] that you're going to possess every
[1:03:00] promise I mean that you're going to be
[1:03:02] the one that's going to do it you know
[1:03:03] before we go down that road it's amazing
[1:03:05] uh just how as soon as this happens now
[1:03:07] God actually shows him how he's going to
[1:03:09] inherit it
[1:03:10] then the very next chapter Sarah tells
[1:03:13] Abraham to take Hagar and through him
[1:03:15] have the promised son so as soon as God
[1:03:17] gives a promise man automatically for
[1:03:19] some reason works out how can they
[1:03:21] fulfill it because because Abraham was
[1:03:23] told by God this is how it's going to
[1:03:25] happen so basically I'm going to do it
[1:03:26] I'm going to join myself to you and
[1:03:29] you're going to have the promised son
[1:03:30] but then man says well it doesn't seem
[1:03:32] to be working so let's try it a
[1:03:34] different way and how often do we take a
[1:03:36] promise of God and we lay our hands upon
[1:03:39] that promise to try and make it
[1:03:40] fulfilled because it seems like there's
[1:03:42] a time delay in the promise coming and
[1:03:45] that though though there may be a delay
[1:03:46] it will happen right Faith doesn't know
[1:03:49] a time limit amen we know time limits
[1:03:51] Faith knows no time limit I mean if
[1:03:53] you've really got a revelation in your
[1:03:55] heart that it's going to happen it's
[1:03:56] going to happen and you can walk on
[1:03:58] praising God that it's going to happen
[1:03:59] amen remember because with Abraham it
[1:04:01] was a revelation he wasn't hoping he was
[1:04:04] going to have the promised son it was
[1:04:05] revealed to him amen so he could just
[1:04:07] walk on praising God for 25 years
[1:04:09] knowing the promise was on its road but
[1:04:12] Sarah had not had a visitation Abraham
[1:04:15] had a lot of visitations but Sarah
[1:04:16] hadn't had one so she doubted the
[1:04:18] promise because it wasn't real to her
[1:04:20] because God hadn't revealed it to her
[1:04:22] yet but she was part of the promise so
[1:04:24] you know there's about 25-year span if I
[1:04:27] could say it like that you know of of of
[1:04:28] of of one of them getting the promise
[1:04:30] you know being revealed and then Sarah
[1:04:32] getting the promise revealed to her but
[1:04:34] they were both part of that same promise
[1:04:36] see things can carry on but hey if we're
[1:04:38] all part of the promise eventually we're
[1:04:40] going to catch up I mean but it takes
[1:04:41] God to come on the scene Amen to to
[1:04:44] speak to our hearts I mean for it to
[1:04:47] happen so in Genesis 18 God would come
[1:04:49] down in flesh we know there were three
[1:04:51] men came to Abraham and God I mean
[1:04:54] Abraham called one of them Lord right
[1:04:55] and that one one of them that one stayed
[1:04:57] with Abraham when the other two went
[1:04:59] down to Asylum to investigate what was
[1:05:00] going on and then so God would be
[1:05:03] sitting there having a meal with Abraham
[1:05:05] and Sarah was in the tent behind him and
[1:05:07] and and she was overhearing the
[1:05:09] conversation in Abraham would tell I
[1:05:11] mean I mean God would tell Abraham you
[1:05:13] know according to time of life I'm going
[1:05:14] to visit you you're going to have the
[1:05:16] promised son now time of life doesn't
[1:05:18] speak of a man who speaks of a woman so
[1:05:20] so he's saying no actually you know
[1:05:21] you're going to have the problem of son
[1:05:22] so he's saying according to time of life
[1:05:24] you and you and Sarah are going to have
[1:05:27] a child and she laughs in her heart
[1:05:29] saying how can this be because we're old
[1:05:31] and how can I know pleasure with my Lord
[1:05:32] you know this is impossible and God
[1:05:34] being the discerner of the heart said
[1:05:36] why did Sarah laugh then she came out
[1:05:38] said no I didn't laugh and he said no
[1:05:40] you did right but because she but the
[1:05:42] reason all that happened is because God
[1:05:44] had to turn Sarah's heart from unbelief
[1:05:47] and doubt and negative thinking into
[1:05:49] faith I mean God had to visit her and
[1:05:52] say no you're part of this promise get
[1:05:54] out of your doubting way see see we
[1:05:57] can't really lift ourselves out of we
[1:05:58] can get into a pit of depression or you
[1:06:00] know you're a melancholic or you're
[1:06:02] being unhappy or whatever we can be all
[1:06:04] down it really takes something greater
[1:06:06] than us to come down and lift us up out
[1:06:08] of that amen so God came down because he
[1:06:11] was not wanting to leave Sarah in that
[1:06:13] condition of you always yo complaining
[1:06:15] maybe about the planes of memory and the
[1:06:17] sand and the dust and the problems and
[1:06:19] the infertility and the impossibility of
[1:06:21] God's word being fulfilled you know
[1:06:23] because there comes a time when people
[1:06:24] just get annoyed
[1:06:26] you know it's amazing you think
[1:06:28] testimonies were just like the whole
[1:06:29] world on fire but some people just get
[1:06:31] annoyed you know people don't Rejoice
[1:06:33] necessarily but the person that it
[1:06:35] happened to they're rejoicing so there
[1:06:37] would have come a time when maybe Sarah
[1:06:38] would have said to Abraham stop talking
[1:06:40] about this
[1:06:41] I cannot go through this guilt and this
[1:06:43] pain in this hurt every month because
[1:06:45] you keep asking me is it happening no
[1:06:48] it's not happening you know there would
[1:06:50] have been a time we just she got sick of
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:53] because she was looking at her own body
[1:06:55] and its own failures
[1:06:57] right that that was actually she just
[1:06:59] thought well this is impossible for me
[1:07:01] to do it and then when she decides to
[1:07:03] give um Hagar to to Abraham she just
[1:07:06] gets jealous
[1:07:07] she just gets angry why because it's man
[1:07:09] trying to fulfill the word and it's a in
[1:07:12] In Their Own Strength
[1:07:14] but then God would come and give give
[1:07:16] her a visitation they're on the plains
[1:07:18] of memory and that's why it's so
[1:07:20] important that we keep a spiritual
[1:07:22] atmosphere around us that that God can
[1:07:24] step down into our lives into our homes
[1:07:26] and touch our family see Abraham brother
[1:07:29] Graham said well keep a spiritual
[1:07:30] atmosphere around them
[1:07:32] how do you keep a spiritual atmosphere
[1:07:34] around and praise God
[1:07:35] sing Psalms in your heart sing Melodies
[1:07:37] in your heart to the Lord remind them of
[1:07:40] his promises remind him of his goodness
[1:07:42] amen it creates a Thanksgiving crates of
[1:07:44] power around you that God can step into
[1:07:46] it's so important we don't focus on the
[1:07:48] negative it's so important that we focus
[1:07:50] on the positive negative thinking has
[1:07:53] helped no one
[1:07:54] if we had everyone from Adam all the way
[1:07:56] to down and we interviewed every single
[1:07:57] one and we asked them when you thought
[1:07:59] negative did it help you the answer
[1:08:02] would be no
[1:08:03] every single one and they would ask well
[1:08:05] what about thinking positive thinking
[1:08:07] about things of faith has Faith ever
[1:08:09] helped you we could have the Heroes of
[1:08:11] Faith stand so by faith this happened
[1:08:13] show us in a bad spot but God came and
[1:08:15] reminded me of his word of his Covenant
[1:08:17] and Faith came to came to the Forefront
[1:08:20] and Faith Delivered amen because
[1:08:22] remember worry and doubt has helped no
[1:08:24] one but faith can deliver that's why we
[1:08:26] should always have positive thinking
[1:08:28] never have negative thinking never think
[1:08:30] there's nothing in this for me or
[1:08:31] there's no point being here amen no
[1:08:33] there's no point the devil being here
[1:08:35] amen but you're a son or daughter of God
[1:08:37] Amen it's very important amen that we
[1:08:40] think positive Hallelujah negative
[1:08:42] thinking creates a lot of problems in
[1:08:44] our body stress anxiety is because of
[1:08:47] negative thinking a lot of it amen so we
[1:08:49] should always think positive
[1:08:51] in every situation
[1:08:53] Hallelujah why because
[1:08:55] that can deliver us
[1:08:57] Hallelujah
[1:08:59] amen so so Sarah had her visitation
[1:09:03] and then they had the promised son
[1:09:05] but even in between the time it's
[1:09:07] amazing you know it wasn't just Sarah
[1:09:08] you know Isaac you know we know it means
[1:09:10] laughter and it wasn't just Sarah that
[1:09:12] laughed
[1:09:13] a few chapters before Genesis 18 God
[1:09:15] would come down and remind Abraham of
[1:09:17] his promise and Abraham laughed in the
[1:09:20] in the presence of God laughing
[1:09:22] basically at God saying how can this
[1:09:23] happen
[1:09:24] yeah it's amazing how we can get to a
[1:09:27] point where we just kind of say this is
[1:09:29] impossible
[1:09:30] but if God has made a promise to you God
[1:09:32] will fulfill that promise amen shall we
[1:09:35] get to spots in our Humanity where we
[1:09:37] begin to doubt and question and worry
[1:09:38] and double-mindedness but God doesn't
[1:09:40] want to keep us in that way amen so this
[1:09:43] time so it wasn't just Sarah that
[1:09:44] laughed but Abraham laughed Hallelujah
[1:09:46] but because the promise had to come
[1:09:48] through them God was God was dead sure
[1:09:50] was going to be fulfilled and it's the
[1:09:52] same thing with you and I sometimes we
[1:09:54] can think how can we ever be the bride
[1:09:55] how can we ever go on a Rapture how can
[1:09:57] we ever overcome and yet God service
[1:09:59] after service amen scripture reading
[1:10:01] after scripture reading message after
[1:10:03] message will tell you you're built to
[1:10:05] overcome I mean your bone of my bone
[1:10:07] Flesh of My Flesh you're part of me amen
[1:10:09] you're built to overcome this age you've
[1:10:11] been anointed To Tread on the head of
[1:10:12] the devil I mean to walk victoriously in
[1:10:15] this age you're built that way amen you
[1:10:17] don't become that way because of the new
[1:10:19] birth but because you are a subtle
[1:10:21] daughter of God you get reborn amen say
[1:10:24] you are a sudden daughter of God right
[1:10:25] hallelujah amen we are built you know
[1:10:28] when Jesus told John in the book Book of
[1:10:30] Revelation today that overcome speaking
[1:10:32] of this age they'll sit with me in my in
[1:10:35] my Throne as I've sat down on my
[1:10:36] father's Throne you know the Lord Jesus
[1:10:38] knew exactly the names of those who
[1:10:39] would be sitting in his throne because
[1:10:41] he knows the end from the from the
[1:10:43] beginning I mean so that that little
[1:10:45] phrase I'm in that I'm in that scripture
[1:10:48] holy I trust you can see yourself in the
[1:10:50] scripture I mean when it talks about the
[1:10:51] bride of Christ and those who have been
[1:10:53] redeemed by the blood of the lamb and
[1:10:55] Made In His Image you say my name's in
[1:10:57] them Hallelujah say well find your name
[1:11:00] in there well Benjamin John Glenn's not
[1:11:02] in there but by faith I see myself in
[1:11:04] there and God says that's you
[1:11:07] Hallelujah I'm not an Ishmael a wild man
[1:11:10] you know because remember man try to put
[1:11:13] their hands on the promise of God
[1:11:15] producing Ishmael and Ishmael was a wild
[1:11:17] man right we don't ever want to train in
[1:11:20] our own ability bring the word to pass
[1:11:21] it'll just make a wild man someone or
[1:11:24] something that's untameable to the word
[1:11:25] of God
[1:11:26] amen but when God does it it's perfect
[1:11:30] Hallelujah so that's why we should
[1:11:31] always just always trust and have faith
[1:11:34] in the promises of God just in his own
[1:11:36] character that God cannot lie he cannot
[1:11:39] fail amen we may not abide faithful but
[1:11:42] he is always faithful the scripture says
[1:11:43] amen that we can trust in our God no
[1:11:45] matter how dark and how scary how bad
[1:11:47] things may get we can look up because we
[1:11:50] know our redemption's drawing nine
[1:11:52] Hallelujah so now so now God would God
[1:11:55] would show the method that that Abraham
[1:11:58] would Abraham and Sarah would receive
[1:12:00] this promised son is that he would God
[1:12:02] would enjoin himself to them by
[1:12:04] sacrifice and God would change their
[1:12:06] names he would actually you know you
[1:12:07] know Abraham was changed to Abraham and
[1:12:10] and sorrow you know Sarah to Sarah right
[1:12:12] that H in the in the Hebrew alphabet
[1:12:15] actually speaks about the Breath of God
[1:12:17] so so God would Breathe into them his
[1:12:20] own his own life changed their names
[1:12:22] because we know a name represents a life
[1:12:24] you think of Moses you think about what
[1:12:26] Moses did right Peter you think about
[1:12:27] what Peter did Paul what Paul did amen
[1:12:30] because the name represents a life you
[1:12:32] think about the Lord Jesus and what he
[1:12:34] did and what he does praise the Lord so
[1:12:36] so when that when he changed their names
[1:12:38] he was actually signifying to them amen
[1:12:41] that that their lives were going to be
[1:12:42] changed
[1:12:43] so God would Breathe into them and
[1:12:46] change them and that's why the Lord
[1:12:47] Jesus before he ascended he breathed on
[1:12:50] his disciples saying receive ye the Holy
[1:12:52] Ghost the Breath of God was going to
[1:12:53] come into them and we know on the day of
[1:12:55] Pentecost he breathed into them the life
[1:12:57] of God came into transformed their lives
[1:13:01] praise God
[1:13:02] Hallelujah but he'd say you shall
[1:13:04] inherit this this is how you'll know
[1:13:06] because I'll join myself to you by
[1:13:07] sacrifice and that's exactly what
[1:13:10] happened that day on Calvary amen that
[1:13:12] God would enjoin himself to a people
[1:13:16] Hallelujah by sacrifice because we know
[1:13:19] that we could never keep you know we
[1:13:20] know this Covenant is unconditional just
[1:13:23] like the Covenant to Abraham because the
[1:13:25] one to Abraham was not if you do this
[1:13:26] I'll do that it's no I have made you
[1:13:28] right I have made you father of Nations
[1:13:30] and Abraham believed it and it came into
[1:13:32] manifestation right it's the same thing
[1:13:34] with us where he has told us we are the
[1:13:36] Bride of Jesus Christ we are sinless is
[1:13:39] here sinless because he became sin who
[1:13:41] knew no sin that would become the very
[1:13:43] righteous of God in Christ who believes
[1:13:45] that scripture amen so so
[1:13:48] he tells us these things
[1:13:50] and he gives us Faith to walk in them
[1:13:52] praise God God furnishes everything you
[1:13:54] know when we get there on that day
[1:13:55] there'll be nothing that we could ever
[1:13:57] inject into what he has done it'll be
[1:13:59] all the Lord
[1:14:00] praise God and I trust that we have that
[1:14:02] even today in our hearts it's all God
[1:14:05] Hallelujah you see the Oriental custom
[1:14:07] brother Bram says here but the auria
[1:14:08] until customers making a a a covenant
[1:14:11] was to kill a beast and stand between
[1:14:13] this beast and then ride out find um
[1:14:16] find uh over here find it in Leviticus
[1:14:18] they write out their agreement and that
[1:14:20] agreement is torn in two over this dead
[1:14:22] beast and they take an oath over the
[1:14:24] dead Beast that if they break this
[1:14:26] Covenant May their body Be As Dead As
[1:14:28] this dead beast and they give each one a
[1:14:30] piece then then they are sent away and
[1:14:32] when they come back those two pieces has
[1:14:34] the dovetail just exactly the same piece
[1:14:36] as how beautiful god making a covenant
[1:14:39] showing pre-showing it I've sworn that
[1:14:40] I'll do it in your seat I'll bless all
[1:14:42] nations of the world read it I'll bless
[1:14:44] the Gentiles I'll bless the black man
[1:14:46] I'll bless the yellow man I'll bless the
[1:14:48] white man I'll bless everyone through
[1:14:50] your seed for out of for out of you will
[1:14:52] come Kings and Priests and then how are
[1:14:54] you going to do it Lord I'll show you
[1:14:55] how and he showed him on a hillside
[1:14:57] where those pieces um where those pieces
[1:15:00] represented any Bible scholar here knows
[1:15:02] that each one of those
[1:15:04] was a clean animal that represented the
[1:15:07] sacrifice of Jesus Christ he was the ram
[1:15:09] he was the heifer that made the Waters
[1:15:11] of Separation when you had the Waters of
[1:15:14] Separation through how we have the
[1:15:16] washing by the Water by the word of the
[1:15:18] separation from sin through the word
[1:15:20] through believing and the pigeon turtle
[1:15:21] doves was Divine Healing and it's all in
[1:15:23] Christ amen and there God showed Abraham
[1:15:26] what he was going to do that through the
[1:15:27] seed of Isaac had bring forth his only
[1:15:29] begotten son Christ and was slain Yonder
[1:15:32] between heavens and earth when the sun
[1:15:34] went down the Blackness over the Earth
[1:15:36] and there he tore him apart he pulled
[1:15:38] his soul out of him and wrote a covenant
[1:15:40] with the families of the earth to me
[1:15:42] that's very powerful when that precious
[1:15:44] unadulterated blood of the almighty God
[1:15:46] dripping from Emmanuel's veins he tore
[1:15:48] out the soul out of him he said my God
[1:15:50] my God why is our forsaken me his face
[1:15:52] was full of mockery spit a crown of
[1:15:54] cruel mockery pulled over his brow his
[1:15:57] nails drove was Roman spikes his back
[1:16:00] ribbon until his ribs show through swing
[1:16:02] on the cross screaming dying a sinner's
[1:16:04] death the sin of the world upon him and
[1:16:06] their God Riven his sides he tore his
[1:16:08] soul out of him when he said unto thy
[1:16:10] hands I command my spirit and he dropped
[1:16:12] his head and the Earth Shook and belched
[1:16:14] out its rocks there he is there's God's
[1:16:17] covenant that's the fulfilling of it
[1:16:18] mid-rendering rocks and darkening Skies
[1:16:21] My Savior bowed his head and died the
[1:16:23] opening Veil revealed the way to
[1:16:25] Heaven's joy and endless day oh Calvary
[1:16:28] o Calvary Jesus bled and died for me
[1:16:30] there he tore the soul out of his own
[1:16:32] son separated a covenant and throwed his
[1:16:34] body into the ground there it laid for
[1:16:36] three days and nights it rose up if it
[1:16:38] was not possible that my Holy One should
[1:16:40] see corruption neither will I sit leave
[1:16:42] a soul in hell and a soul was his spirit
[1:16:45] that ascended into hell he rose down
[1:16:47] godded and picked up the body and gave
[1:16:49] him life and took the body of Jesus and
[1:16:51] said it at the right hand in glory and
[1:16:53] set back the Holy Ghost as a covenant
[1:16:56] amen because man God knew that man could
[1:16:59] never keep a side of the bargain right
[1:17:01] because if he said if you will I'll do
[1:17:03] this we're gonna fail just like the law
[1:17:05] Israel miserably failed
[1:17:08] because it was thou shall not Thou shalt
[1:17:10] thou shall not but because man had a
[1:17:12] fallen nature to begin with there's no
[1:17:14] way he could ever keep the law so God
[1:17:16] had to come and rewrite the nature of
[1:17:18] man amen give it change our nature from
[1:17:21] a one of sin and unbelief into faith in
[1:17:23] his word amen so so because God knew
[1:17:26] that man could never keep his side of
[1:17:27] the bargain he became the Dead one
[1:17:30] Hallelujah he became the sacrifice you
[1:17:33] knew that you couldn't keep it so he
[1:17:35] said well I'm going to keep it myself
[1:17:36] then amen so so that day on Calvary when
[1:17:39] when his blood was poured out of his
[1:17:41] body because of all the wounds he
[1:17:42] received the life in his blood was the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost Hallelujah and then that life
[1:17:47] was released from the blood cell and it
[1:17:49] comes now back into God's believing
[1:17:50] children and changes their nature from
[1:17:53] from a sinner from unbelief into faith
[1:17:55] in the word of God Amen that's why it's
[1:17:57] so vital we receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:00] that the life of our sacrifice comes
[1:18:02] into us and changes us Amen in the Old
[1:18:05] Testament we know that they would
[1:18:06] sacrifice bulls and goats and lambs and
[1:18:09] different things but you know the nature
[1:18:11] of that lamb could never come upon the
[1:18:12] worshiper and change them so so the very
[1:18:15] sin that made them come give the
[1:18:16] sacrifice in the first place they left
[1:18:19] with that same nature after they had
[1:18:21] given the sacrifice so they were
[1:18:23] justified by giving the offering but it
[1:18:25] didn't change them on the inside so even
[1:18:27] David with all of his sincere desire to
[1:18:29] love God and walk with God and he says I
[1:18:32] ever set God before my face that I stood
[1:18:34] not against him you know that was really
[1:18:36] all that all that desire it didn't
[1:18:38] change his carnal nature he was born
[1:18:39] with so when he saw bathshebra out the
[1:18:42] window that day all that was pushed
[1:18:43] aside and he went and committed adultery
[1:18:45] with her why because nothing could
[1:18:47] change his nature under the blood of
[1:18:49] bulls and goats but under the blood of
[1:18:51] Jesus Christ amen he has a transforming
[1:18:54] power that can change our nature amen
[1:18:56] that we don't just suppress things but
[1:18:58] God changes our desires that it's gone
[1:19:01] Hallelujah I'm so glad it's that way
[1:19:04] aren't you amen it's not us just trying
[1:19:06] to keep ourselves from sin or unbelief
[1:19:08] but it's God changes our nature like
[1:19:10] I've said many times when I was young I
[1:19:11] couldn't stand broccoli
[1:19:13] because there's just something in me I
[1:19:14] had no appetite for broccoli right but
[1:19:16] then one day I just you know something
[1:19:18] changed in my appetite broccoli ain't so
[1:19:20] bad after all right but something had to
[1:19:23] change in me that I like broccoli now
[1:19:25] right the same thing with you and I
[1:19:27] we're born with the nature we don't want
[1:19:29] God at all the scripture says there's
[1:19:30] nothing with us that seeks after him
[1:19:32] right so we don't have I'd say we don't
[1:19:34] have the appetite for him but then God
[1:19:36] does the work he begins to brood over
[1:19:38] our lives and call us to himself and we
[1:19:40] make a full Serenity changes us and our
[1:19:42] appetite changes for where once we love
[1:19:45] the world now there's nothing in us that
[1:19:47] wants the world Hallelujah like I've
[1:19:49] said many times I used to make Homebrew
[1:19:51] as a university student used to party up
[1:19:52] and all those things but now that desire
[1:19:54] was totally taken out of my life there's
[1:19:56] nothing in me that wants alcohol anymore
[1:19:58] I don't have to keep myself from it I
[1:20:00] just don't want it it's like broccoli
[1:20:02] when I was a kid I didn't want broccoli
[1:20:03] I would look at things and I see it
[1:20:05] repeated now I would see things on my
[1:20:07] place I don't like that never tasted it
[1:20:10] never had it in my life I don't like
[1:20:11] that Hallelujah and there's just things
[1:20:13] now it's like well you see things in the
[1:20:15] world I don't like that why because your
[1:20:17] Nature's change is gone praise God I
[1:20:19] believe that's what our God does
[1:20:22] Hallelujah now our lord Jesus is the
[1:20:26] inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen he
[1:20:29] is our satisfying portion amen he is
[1:20:32] more than an idea he's more than a
[1:20:33] Doctrine but he's a satisfying fountain
[1:20:36] that we can drink from and be satisfied
[1:20:38] and feel refreshed and rejoice and move
[1:20:41] on with him
[1:20:42] Hallelujah now but the thing is we have
[1:20:44] to drink it's very important that we
[1:20:46] drink we actually enter into a spiritual
[1:20:49] relationship with our Lord where it's
[1:20:51] not just in our heads but in our hearts
[1:20:52] amen it's very vital that we do this
[1:20:55] brother Brown would say that Christ is
[1:20:56] the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we
[1:20:58] are planted in him by the Holy Spirit
[1:21:00] and then and then we just drink from him
[1:21:02] every person that's a Christian he says
[1:21:05] the devil don't care how much you come
[1:21:06] to Christ as long as you don't drink
[1:21:08] amen you can stand at the table and your
[1:21:11] mouth watering saying well I'm here I'm
[1:21:12] here you but you're afraid to turn your
[1:21:14] faith loose see see and cry and see he
[1:21:18] says I love guns a man in the last
[1:21:19] meeting in Minneapolis the brother
[1:21:22] knowed my weakness I love to hunt and he
[1:21:24] gave me a rifle and oh how I love it of
[1:21:27] hunting and rifles and fishing he said
[1:21:29] I've got a rifle sitting here at home
[1:21:30] just to go hunting I'll never use it
[1:21:32] it'll never do me no good and when you
[1:21:34] receive the Holy Ghost everything you
[1:21:35] have need of for the Earth journey is in
[1:21:38] you then turn it loose and let it go to
[1:21:40] work let your faith loose and believe
[1:21:42] God well what do you mean by turn your
[1:21:45] faith loose let your faith control your
[1:21:47] life don't let your personality control
[1:21:49] your reservations or you know or or your
[1:21:52] nature or your upbringing don't let
[1:21:54] those things control you let your faith
[1:21:56] control your life that's how you let
[1:21:58] your faith loose see it's amazing when
[1:22:00] we
[1:22:01] when we look into the scripture there's
[1:22:03] many examples of people who let their
[1:22:05] faith loose who let their faith control
[1:22:07] or govern them more than their
[1:22:09] circumstances or their background you
[1:22:12] know there was a woman a Greek
[1:22:13] esophonician in in Mark chapter 7 and
[1:22:17] she had a daughter that was grievously
[1:22:18] vexed with the devil now she let her
[1:22:21] faith loose and and she was determined
[1:22:24] that she had to get to Jesus that her
[1:22:26] daughter would be made well now she had
[1:22:28] a lot of obstacles but her faith didn't
[1:22:30] have any obstacles you know people would
[1:22:32] tell her you know don't have anything to
[1:22:34] do with the Jews they'll have nothing to
[1:22:35] do with you who may be her pastor also
[1:22:37] said don't go and speak to that fanatic
[1:22:39] you know he's got nothing for you anyhow
[1:22:41] and you know but but her faith was was
[1:22:43] great
[1:22:44] and she was determined you know she just
[1:22:46] let her faith loose and her life and her
[1:22:48] faith led her to the source of her need
[1:22:51] I mean the one that could set her
[1:22:53] daughter free amen so we may have a lot
[1:22:56] of a lot of obstacles but Faith doesn't
[1:22:58] know obstacles
[1:23:00] Hallelujah see she was persistent
[1:23:03] I mean she was determined amen and then
[1:23:06] you know it's amazing when Jesus even
[1:23:08] when she got into his presence you know
[1:23:10] many times we think well we've gone to
[1:23:12] the prince of the Lord then it's all
[1:23:13] over actually many times that's when the
[1:23:15] battle really begins amen so maybe she
[1:23:17] got past the obstacles of her family and
[1:23:19] different criticizes her neighbors
[1:23:21] saying where are you going what are you
[1:23:22] up to and you know don't go down there
[1:23:24] don't go see Herman you know but but she
[1:23:26] pushed all past all that and then she
[1:23:28] got to the prince of of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:30] crying out all son of David have mercy
[1:23:33] on me and Jesus ignored her and her
[1:23:35] disciples you know would I mean his
[1:23:38] disciples were trying to discourage a
[1:23:39] different things and then she came
[1:23:41] before the Lord said Lord you know have
[1:23:43] mercy on me Lord and and the Lord Jesus
[1:23:46] said has not fit to give the children's
[1:23:48] bread to the dogs so he's basically
[1:23:50] saying it's not fit what I have to give
[1:23:52] to you
[1:23:53] but you see she had obstacles but Faith
[1:23:56] doesn't know any obstacles and she let
[1:23:58] her faith
[1:23:59] loose that drove her there amen see see
[1:24:03] when you let your faith loose it will
[1:24:06] not rest until it reaches its
[1:24:07] destination right she really see if she
[1:24:10] didn't actually let her faith loose at
[1:24:11] the first obstacle she would have quit
[1:24:13] got angry and walked on and told
[1:24:15] everyone how wrong Jesus is but no she
[1:24:17] had great faith and a great faith took
[1:24:19] her all the way through until she came
[1:24:21] to that place of humility saying yea
[1:24:23] Lord believe the dogs get the crumbs
[1:24:24] from the table and and and the Lord said
[1:24:27] of her great is thy faith she had great
[1:24:30] faith and he knew she had great faith
[1:24:32] amen but but the Lord had that in the
[1:24:34] scripture to show us a principle that if
[1:24:36] our faith if we let our faith loose if
[1:24:39] we let it drive Our Lives who's with me
[1:24:41] today amen because we don't want our uh
[1:24:43] our nature and and thinking what our
[1:24:45] neighbor thinks thinking what our
[1:24:46] parents think thinking what our children
[1:24:48] think thinking what our cousins think of
[1:24:50] thinking what our society thinks or
[1:24:52] whatever that will always hinder us we
[1:24:55] should never care about what anyone else
[1:24:56] thinks we think what about what does the
[1:24:58] Lord think I mean what does he think of
[1:25:00] me I mean we should let our faith loose
[1:25:02] until we get an answer because I believe
[1:25:03] our God is a miracle working God every
[1:25:06] promise in the Bible is true he's still
[1:25:08] as powerful and able and willing to do
[1:25:10] it as he did when he first did it I mean
[1:25:12] if we approach god with the same Faith
[1:25:14] they did we'll get the same results
[1:25:16] Hallelujah so so the Lord's the greatest
[1:25:18] thy faith and her daughter was was set
[1:25:21] free
[1:25:22] Hallelujah why because she lit her faith
[1:25:25] drive her amen When Faith catches a hold
[1:25:27] faith says it's so and Faith knows no
[1:25:30] difficult Faith knows no defeat when
[1:25:33] you've got faith you have perseverance
[1:25:34] you're going to push through amen you're
[1:25:37] saying perseverance this Greek had heard
[1:25:38] these words she believed it she had many
[1:25:40] hindrances but her faith didn't have any
[1:25:42] faith knows no hindrance her faith had
[1:25:45] no hindrance she had but her faith
[1:25:47] didn't have you may have hindrance but
[1:25:49] if you've got faith it knows no defeat
[1:25:51] it's positive amen so we should really
[1:25:53] push on until you know we we need to get
[1:25:56] to a place where we don't care when you
[1:25:58] really don't care about anything that's
[1:26:00] when faith can be let loose if we care
[1:26:02] about what people think our outstanding
[1:26:04] or reputation whatever if you care about
[1:26:06] those things Faith can't be let loose to
[1:26:09] to to govern Our Lives see but we've got
[1:26:11] to get to a place where we just don't
[1:26:12] care now there is another woman in the
[1:26:14] scripture that had an alabaster box now
[1:26:16] you think about this she was going to
[1:26:18] she was going to swap her man-made
[1:26:21] alabaster box that had limited volume
[1:26:23] and it was just a man-made perfume in it
[1:26:26] for a Fountain of Living Water that was
[1:26:28] going to flow out of her being Holly
[1:26:30] she's going to swap a man-made container
[1:26:32] with a supernatural vessel I mean a
[1:26:35] man-made perfume that was limited in in
[1:26:38] what it could do just make things smell
[1:26:40] nice is all it could do to Fountains of
[1:26:42] Living Water that could raise the dead
[1:26:44] heal the sick quench a thirsty Soul
[1:26:46] bring eternal life bring healing Amen to
[1:26:49] the word we manifest in her life she
[1:26:50] swapped a man-made thing for a
[1:26:53] supernatural Fountain of Living Water
[1:26:55] but she got to a point where she just
[1:26:57] didn't care
[1:26:58] amen because she saw she wasn't invited
[1:27:01] to
[1:27:02] um Simon the Pharisees uh Feast but you
[1:27:05] know when she saw Jesus sitting in there
[1:27:06] with with unwash unwashed feet and and
[1:27:09] not made welcome it just really stirred
[1:27:11] her up you know God's going to get
[1:27:13] worship somewhere you know God will get
[1:27:15] praise God will get a genuine heartfelt
[1:27:17] worship from somebody and wherever he's
[1:27:20] invited he'll get it from somewhere you
[1:27:22] know it's amazing it's amazing it you
[1:27:23] know it was put on Simon's heart to to
[1:27:25] to to to invite the Lord Jesus to his
[1:27:28] Feast now his motives weren't pure but
[1:27:29] Jesus went anyway amen because Jesus
[1:27:32] knew there'd be a woman there that
[1:27:33] wasn't invited to the feast but you
[1:27:34] would come into the feast and her whole
[1:27:36] life would be changed amen but she got
[1:27:38] to a point where she just didn't care
[1:27:40] say she did not care that she wasn't on
[1:27:42] the guest list anymore she did not care
[1:27:44] that she might not be allowed in she did
[1:27:46] not care what the neighbors would think
[1:27:48] about her she did not care what her
[1:27:50] friends or family would think she did
[1:27:51] not care about the consequences she did
[1:27:53] not care what Simon said she didn't care
[1:27:55] about what anyone would say or do she
[1:27:57] just had to get to the Lord so her faith
[1:28:00] was let loose and it led her all the way
[1:28:01] to the Master's feet amen and then when
[1:28:04] she got that Alabaster Box she actually
[1:28:06] took all of her earnings and we know she
[1:28:08] was a harlot it's amazing God knows
[1:28:11] where we get our old life from
[1:28:14] but he doesn't turn away if we give it
[1:28:17] to him that will make a great exchange
[1:28:18] here's the greatest exchange to to
[1:28:20] receive life when you give him death
[1:28:23] right to to receive healing when you
[1:28:25] give him pain
[1:28:26] Hallelujah yo it's amazing he has the
[1:28:29] greatest exchange you think about it's
[1:28:30] the greatest exchange there ever would
[1:28:31] be I mean where where were these broken
[1:28:34] decrepit creatures Fallen by nature but
[1:28:37] yet we give our lives to him and he
[1:28:39] gives us eternal life he gives us his
[1:28:41] own nature he gives us overcoming power
[1:28:44] Hallelujah so she got to a point she
[1:28:46] didn't care about any of those things
[1:28:48] she just had to get to him I mean so so
[1:28:51] she got all all of her all of her
[1:28:53] earnings she went to the Apothecary you
[1:28:56] know got the got the most valuable uh
[1:28:58] perfume in the place
[1:29:00] and then she put her into a robe and
[1:29:02] then she just ran and somehow she got
[1:29:04] past the footwash flunky and those that
[1:29:06] anoint and kiss and make welcome and
[1:29:08] somehow she found herself at the feet of
[1:29:10] the master remember she didn't care see
[1:29:13] the devil always say you know don't say
[1:29:15] Amen what will this person think of you
[1:29:17] what about your friends at school what
[1:29:19] about these people on the job what about
[1:29:21] your family here what what about your
[1:29:22] wife or your children or what about your
[1:29:24] brother or sister he always tell us
[1:29:26] those things to keep us stuck
[1:29:28] right but but if we really get to a
[1:29:30] place where what is that good gonna do
[1:29:32] you know what good is that gonna do to
[1:29:33] me
[1:29:34] always trying to please all these people
[1:29:36] they just hold us back what about
[1:29:38] pleasing the Lord what about coming to
[1:29:40] him that he can change our lives amen
[1:29:42] peer pressures of the devil
[1:29:44] peer pressure is actually satanic right
[1:29:47] to try and keep people down and try and
[1:29:49] oh no you better not rise above you know
[1:29:51] there's such a tall poppy syndrome in
[1:29:52] this country everyone's got to become
[1:29:54] the same way we're not all the same way
[1:29:57] we're Sons and Daughters of God Amen who
[1:30:00] cares about what the critic says or what
[1:30:01] people will say you know but they'll
[1:30:03] never be my friends again if you meet
[1:30:05] the Lord God can get a hold of them
[1:30:07] right the thing that helped Abe um
[1:30:09] helped a lot was Abraham Walking with
[1:30:11] God that's the thing that helped lot
[1:30:13] right it didn't help a lot when when
[1:30:16] they were walking together and
[1:30:17] compromising having trouble is when they
[1:30:19] separated and God walked with God I mean
[1:30:21] Abraham walked with God why because he
[1:30:23] got pulled out when he was taken captive
[1:30:24] with the Kings and when they are inside
[1:30:26] and where was Abraham wasn't with them
[1:30:28] he was up on the plains of memory
[1:30:29] interceding for his family and God
[1:30:31] pulled them out
[1:30:33] Hallelujah so you know
[1:30:36] we're going to think about our friend
[1:30:37] you know what what what influence do
[1:30:39] people have on our lives now I'm not
[1:30:42] saying don't have any friends who are
[1:30:43] not Believers hey you're friends with
[1:30:44] whoever but you've got to be careful
[1:30:46] because I'll either drag you one way or
[1:30:48] you'll drag them one way
[1:30:51] amen so so may may our influence always
[1:30:53] be upon them and not their influence
[1:30:55] upon us
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:58] amen that the law can get a hold of
[1:31:00] their lives and bring them into eternal
[1:31:01] life amen so so he she pushed past all
[1:31:05] these things
[1:31:06] and she didn't even think about the
[1:31:07] consequences where she got you know
[1:31:09] there's something when you get into the
[1:31:10] prince of God
[1:31:11] your own State yo you just can't hold it
[1:31:13] back
[1:31:14] you know there's no dried-eyed
[1:31:16] confession
[1:31:17] you know she just totally broke down and
[1:31:20] she took the alabaster box and she
[1:31:21] reached a point of no return where she
[1:31:23] could she broke it and she couldn't put
[1:31:25] it back together again it's the same
[1:31:26] thing when we really give our lives to
[1:31:28] the Lord Jesus you can't take it back
[1:31:29] you can't you can't assemble your
[1:31:31] Alabaster Box again you can't put the
[1:31:33] perfume of your life back in it's it's
[1:31:35] spilled it's on his feet holy your tears
[1:31:38] begin to come down and you just pour out
[1:31:40] your whole life and the Lord Jesus
[1:31:42] shouldn't turned her away
[1:31:44] he was there for her
[1:31:46] Hallelujah I believe he's here for
[1:31:48] somebody today amen when we get to a
[1:31:50] point where we just don't care push Puck
[1:31:52] let your faith turn loose until it comes
[1:31:54] to its destination amen you'll find your
[1:31:57] life will totally transformed amen she
[1:31:59] she walked out of there hey she had a
[1:32:01] lot of critics and the criticism
[1:32:03] actually went upon him
[1:32:04] if he really knew the kind of woman she
[1:32:07] was
[1:32:08] you know if he's really a prophet he
[1:32:11] wouldn't let her touch him
[1:32:12] you know all the criticism goes on that
[1:32:15] you know but she didn't care remember
[1:32:16] her worship filled the whole place
[1:32:18] her worship interrupted the whole party
[1:32:21] Hallelujah you know brother Brahm says
[1:32:23] you know may we get out of order long
[1:32:25] enough until one of us get saved you
[1:32:27] know we get so caught up in church ways
[1:32:29] and well this is just how we do it here
[1:32:30] but what about really getting a hold of
[1:32:32] God maybe because of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:34] inspiring it's in order right if God
[1:32:36] causes you to jump or shout or cry or
[1:32:39] whatever that's God that's Church order
[1:32:42] Hallelujah
[1:32:44] amen and then and then he would say to
[1:32:46] her
[1:32:48] your sins are forgiven you go in peace
[1:32:51] so now she was walking out with a
[1:32:53] totally different life
[1:32:55] Hallelujah she was now walking out with
[1:32:57] the peace of God God's Shalom upon her
[1:33:00] life
[1:33:00] Hallelujah and and I believe she went
[1:33:03] she went to the upper room she was one
[1:33:05] of the Believers
[1:33:06] so what so so she swapped a man-made box
[1:33:08] with a Fountain of Living Water I mean
[1:33:11] it wasn't some broken system she was
[1:33:13] drinking from some man-made tank anymore
[1:33:15] I mean but it was God's inexhaustible
[1:33:17] Fountain of Life Hallelujah and she
[1:33:19] didn't just come and drink it it was
[1:33:21] coming out of her
[1:33:22] Hallelujah and they said there's a big
[1:33:24] difference because in the Book of
[1:33:25] Revelation it says about those who come
[1:33:27] out of the Great Tribulation it says
[1:33:28] they'll be led to the rivers of Living
[1:33:30] Water so so there's a group of people on
[1:33:34] this side that it will come out of them
[1:33:36] but there's the people on that side
[1:33:37] they'll be led to drink to it they don't
[1:33:40] have it on this side see there's the
[1:33:41] wise and the foolish virgin the wise
[1:33:43] have oil in their lamps they have the
[1:33:45] Fountain of Living Water pouring out of
[1:33:46] them
[1:33:47] Hallelujah and there's those that don't
[1:33:50] have the Holy Ghost go through the Great
[1:33:51] Tribulation get eternal life then they
[1:33:53] drink them I'd rather drink now I'd
[1:33:55] rather have the fountain come out that
[1:33:57] when people come into my presence they
[1:33:58] get refreshed they have a cool drink
[1:34:00] remember they come troubled or upset or
[1:34:02] whatever more but then just just
[1:34:03] spending some time together maybe
[1:34:05] talking about anything they just get you
[1:34:07] know calmed down they take a drink
[1:34:08] they're no longer crying up yo
[1:34:11] everything's fine well he's a Fountain
[1:34:13] of Living Water
[1:34:15] this is a this is not just some Buzz
[1:34:18] phrase
[1:34:19] it's a it's got to be a reality
[1:34:23] it's got to be a reality amen
[1:34:27] but you see people are afraid of the new
[1:34:30] birth I'm just going to drop this in
[1:34:31] here people are afraid of the new birth
[1:34:32] they're afraid of it now any birth I
[1:34:34] don't care what level it's on it's a
[1:34:35] mess you take it out yonder in a pig pen
[1:34:38] any birth is a mess if it's in a pig pen
[1:34:40] if it's in a cow stable it's in a pink
[1:34:42] decorated hospital room I don't care
[1:34:44] where a birth takes place it's a mess a
[1:34:46] new birth is the same it'll make you do
[1:34:49] things that you didn't that you didn't
[1:34:50] think you'd do you might you might cry
[1:34:53] boohoo rub around on the altar no matter
[1:34:56] what you do he says I never ask God
[1:34:59] it wouldn't do no good to try and bring
[1:35:01] the new birth to my level see many
[1:35:03] people want want God on on their level
[1:35:06] on on their life on how they think it
[1:35:09] should be God if you're God you do it
[1:35:11] according to what I want
[1:35:13] that's not no God's not an errand boy
[1:35:15] he's not just someone we asked Lord do
[1:35:17] this and do that I want you to change
[1:35:18] this and change this no God's not he's
[1:35:21] he he's the Lord God Almighty he's the
[1:35:23] creator of heavens and earth he's not
[1:35:25] just some errand boy we can push around
[1:35:26] no
[1:35:28] he's God see many people just want him
[1:35:30] as Savior but not Lord he must be both
[1:35:33] amen so see I wouldn't want to try and
[1:35:36] bring the new birth to my level I want
[1:35:37] to meet God God's level of the new birth
[1:35:40] and receive it I don't care what I have
[1:35:41] to do see if you come to a point where
[1:35:43] you don't care what will happen then
[1:35:45] it'll happen
[1:35:47] someone said not long ago I'm afraid to
[1:35:49] receive the Holy Ghost I'm afraid
[1:35:50] that'll make me speak in tongues like
[1:35:52] them others I don't care if I spoke in
[1:35:54] tongues talked in tongues crowed in
[1:35:55] tongues or anything else I want the Holy
[1:35:57] Ghost that's the main principle I don't
[1:35:59] care what level it is I'll meet God on
[1:36:01] his level what he wants to say is right
[1:36:04] that's where I want to stand that new
[1:36:06] birth that changes a man changes a woman
[1:36:08] changes it changes a new desire changes
[1:36:10] their appetites wrestle with God until
[1:36:12] you can hold on until the blessing comes
[1:36:14] then God will change you like he said
[1:36:16] Jacob supplanter to to Israel who's a
[1:36:18] prince
[1:36:19] Hallelujah so so we've got to get to a
[1:36:21] place where we just don't care
[1:36:24] Hallelujah
[1:36:25] praise the Lord I believe I'm looking to
[1:36:27] people that don't care
[1:36:28] amen you burned every bridge you say
[1:36:31] Lord I'm I'm walking with you I don't
[1:36:33] care you can take the whole world Just
[1:36:35] Give Me Jesus I believe I'm looking at
[1:36:36] those kind of people
[1:36:38] Hallelujah
[1:36:39] Hallelujah so I'm just trying to find
[1:36:41] something
[1:36:42] amen praise the Lord I'm glad we can the
[1:36:45] Lord's so merciful to us we can just
[1:36:46] push through we don't care about
[1:36:47] anything and
[1:36:48] meet him
[1:36:50] amen so as I said it's not just a a buzz
[1:36:53] phrase out of your belly shall flow
[1:36:54] rivers of Living Water the Holy Ghost
[1:36:56] will flow out he says he says I'm
[1:36:58] planting the vine and where to plant it
[1:36:59] now Israel and Egypt was not planted
[1:37:01] they were just set out it wasn't their
[1:37:03] original home ground and a man that's a
[1:37:05] Christian that rests his eternal
[1:37:07] destination on some denominational Creed
[1:37:09] he's not in his right place he was born
[1:37:10] to be free a child of God to worship God
[1:37:13] but not under a Creed he can't bring
[1:37:15] forth his fruit yet something in him is
[1:37:17] longing to do it he shall be like a tree
[1:37:19] that's planted by the rivers of water
[1:37:21] Rivers plural water singular many rivers
[1:37:24] coming into the one channel in other
[1:37:26] words he'd be like a man in the
[1:37:27] scripture that believes all the word of
[1:37:29] God where the power and the nine
[1:37:31] spiritual gifts can flow through one God
[1:37:34] into his innermost being people don't
[1:37:36] believe in shouting the thing of it as
[1:37:37] they don't have spiritual joy and the
[1:37:40] joys of the Water of Life can flow
[1:37:42] through then there's a whole lot in the
[1:37:44] matter with with the Branham Tabernacle
[1:37:46] because it's unbelief and cares of the
[1:37:48] world has bound the people until it
[1:37:49] cannot produce spiritual growth so we've
[1:37:52] got to get to a place I'll say even here
[1:37:53] we can get to a place because of
[1:37:55] unbelief in the cares of the world that
[1:37:57] it binds us up to the water of God can't
[1:37:59] flow
[1:38:00] Hallelujah see
[1:38:03] if we believe all the word of God then
[1:38:06] the power and the nine spiritual gifts
[1:38:08] can throw a flow I mean through one God
[1:38:11] into our innermost being and flow out
[1:38:13] he says one thing say well I believe the
[1:38:15] word but but what's it doing in our
[1:38:16] lives I mean there's got to be a
[1:38:18] manifestation of that faith
[1:38:20] hallelujah amen and I believe that we
[1:38:23] are here in this hour amen for this to
[1:38:25] be so that's not just a confession but
[1:38:27] it's actually a possession of every
[1:38:29] promise
[1:38:30] amen say we've got to realize that God's
[1:38:32] quickening power of His Holy Ghost is
[1:38:33] essential and even as brothers saying
[1:38:36] the Easter seal is his tongues quickened
[1:38:38] together to a new Heavenly language
[1:38:39] speaking of the day of Pentecost to
[1:38:41] speak to them a rapturing up rising up
[1:38:42] into a different atmosphere that they
[1:38:44] ever have ever had lived in see when the
[1:38:47] Holy Ghost comes into a life you live in
[1:38:48] a different atmosphere you live in a
[1:38:50] different way of thinking different
[1:38:51] Outlook of life everything has changed
[1:38:53] because you're no longer in the fog and
[1:38:54] the trouble in the valley you're high up
[1:38:56] I mean above every storm you can see
[1:38:58] things for what they are who's with me
[1:39:00] today amen because why we are changing
[1:39:03] we are raised up into a totally
[1:39:04] different atmosphere where it's not
[1:39:06] troubles and fussing and fighting and
[1:39:08] drama that governs Our Lives as the
[1:39:09] peace of God in the word amen that
[1:39:12] govern Our Lives Hallelujah also with
[1:39:14] the new quickening life to them that
[1:39:16] comes in them it quickens their language
[1:39:18] they spoken new tongues oh yes now watch
[1:39:20] them it also was designed to give them
[1:39:23] after this abstract it was designed to
[1:39:25] give them every promise that was on the
[1:39:27] grounds every promise on the grounds of
[1:39:29] God's word that was promised in the
[1:39:30] Bible that quickening power was to give
[1:39:32] to them to Quicken the that promise to
[1:39:36] them therefore they laid hands on the
[1:39:38] sick they they was healed they spoke in
[1:39:40] new tongues they'd done great signs and
[1:39:41] wonders because it was in God's promise
[1:39:43] and when Jesus died to redeem that back
[1:39:46] to them the grounds that belonged to the
[1:39:49] sons of God he demonstrated what God was
[1:39:51] and he says how dare we try to socialize
[1:39:54] and put it into an organization we have
[1:39:55] no rights to do that it's the Holy Ghost
[1:39:57] today hunting out honest hearts that
[1:39:59] will believe the message everything in
[1:40:01] the Bible that was promised is to that
[1:40:03] believer and when we accept it in its
[1:40:05] fullness and God knows we'll do it he
[1:40:07] gives you the abstract to that that when
[1:40:09] every promise is made is in your
[1:40:11] possession and the Holy Ghost is there
[1:40:12] to Quicken that to you oh my what kind
[1:40:15] of people should we be how wonderful to
[1:40:18] see God's Great Holy Spirit here to do
[1:40:19] that power think of it when the Holy
[1:40:21] Spirit itself here to be a record of
[1:40:23] this hour Jesus said so he's the same
[1:40:25] yesterday today and forever
[1:40:28] he says how did any man try and wipe
[1:40:30] that out of there the works that I do
[1:40:32] you shall do also John 14 12. these
[1:40:35] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:40:36] that is the Assurance when we see a
[1:40:39] group of people sitting together and
[1:40:40] those signs manifesting themselves
[1:40:42] that's the assurance that the abstract
[1:40:44] is there to vindicate that that's God's
[1:40:46] that's the property of God Amen why
[1:40:49] because what happens is like Abraham was
[1:40:51] asking the question how am I going to
[1:40:52] receive this and God says I'm going to
[1:40:55] join myself to you by sacrifice so the
[1:40:57] Lord when he died on Calvary his body
[1:40:59] amen we know it went down to Hell I mean
[1:41:01] your body went to the gravers he went
[1:41:02] down to Hell preached the souls in
[1:41:04] prison took the keys of Hell death in
[1:41:05] the grave off the devil ascended on high
[1:41:07] amen then he's on the right hand of the
[1:41:09] Majesty on high but his Spirit came down
[1:41:11] to the people and that show that they
[1:41:14] were joined to God by his blood by the
[1:41:16] blood of Jesus Christ amen so when the
[1:41:18] Holy Ghost comes unto you it quickens
[1:41:20] you to every promise that's in the word
[1:41:22] of God
[1:41:22] Hallelujah I mean so what kind of people
[1:41:25] should we be amen if we realize that
[1:41:27] every promise of God is ours because he
[1:41:30] has joined himself to us by his own
[1:41:31] death bear Resurrection
[1:41:33] Hallelujah give us such a boldness and
[1:41:35] Faith amen that every promise we should
[1:41:37] never take no for an answer
[1:41:39] amen because God's promises are true it
[1:41:42] may happen in a different way that we
[1:41:44] think it should
[1:41:45] because because really what we need to
[1:41:47] pray for is God's perfect will amen but
[1:41:49] if we look into a scripture and say lord
[1:41:52] it's in your will that we would prosper
[1:41:54] in health
[1:41:55] as your soul prospers right amen that
[1:41:58] our family and us should be saved
[1:42:00] hallelujah amen that we shouldn't be
[1:42:02] tormented in our minds you know it's one
[1:42:04] thing to have a mind battle but don't
[1:42:05] prolong the Mind battle
[1:42:07] don't don't why why entertain the devil
[1:42:10] day after day after week with depression
[1:42:12] and trouble and troubled thoughts and
[1:42:14] trouble going on no take the word of God
[1:42:16] yo brother Bram said it's like a farmer
[1:42:19] you know like thoughts we can't stop
[1:42:20] them coming into our mind but we can
[1:42:22] stop them roosting like a bird
[1:42:25] you know you're like there's sparrows
[1:42:27] out here now we don't take a shotgun but
[1:42:29] if you're a farmer saying there's
[1:42:30] annoying bird somewhere you can blast
[1:42:31] them out of the sky right stop them
[1:42:33] roosting amen but you see see it's like
[1:42:36] a thought you can't stop it coming we
[1:42:37] can stop it roosting you can stop it
[1:42:39] taking hold and taking taking control of
[1:42:41] your whole thought life so what do you
[1:42:43] do you take the double barrel shotgun of
[1:42:45] the Old and New Testament and you start
[1:42:48] blasting those thoughts and when you
[1:42:50] take the word of God and defeat every
[1:42:52] thought that's how you bring every
[1:42:53] thought captive to the word of God so so
[1:42:56] for example you know you're beginning to
[1:42:57] think well I'm never going to be happy
[1:42:59] again
[1:43:00] no but at him is the fullness of joy my
[1:43:04] joy I give unto you amen I'll never have
[1:43:06] peace no the peace that pass all
[1:43:07] understanding I'll give you I'll never
[1:43:10] be well well by his stripes I'm healed
[1:43:12] amen there's no way that my children or
[1:43:14] my family Protocols are coming home no
[1:43:16] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ I know
[1:43:18] my house shall be saved what does that
[1:43:20] do that blasts every negative thought
[1:43:21] out by taking the word and combating it
[1:43:24] oh yeah well we know I I can never go
[1:43:27] back to my first love but this is now a
[1:43:29] restoration I shall restore thus saith
[1:43:31] the Lord all the years that the Palm
[1:43:33] worm Cancun Locust caterpillar have
[1:43:35] eaten I will restore to you so oh it's
[1:43:37] been so many Wasted Years but I will
[1:43:39] restore it saith the Lord amen so we can
[1:43:42] take those things and blast them out of
[1:43:43] our mind amen what's that taking every
[1:43:46] thought captive to the word of God
[1:43:47] that's why we must be always be positive
[1:43:50] in our thinking amen always think on the
[1:43:52] word of every promise you know the only
[1:43:54] negative promises are towards the devil
[1:43:56] and him
[1:43:57] what did you say I'm gonna throw you in
[1:43:59] a lake of fire you're defeated you're
[1:44:02] gonna burn that's not my promise
[1:44:04] it's none of your promises either right
[1:44:07] our promises that will be made in His
[1:44:09] image we're Maiden is likeness where his
[1:44:11] workmanship yeah we can beat ourselves
[1:44:12] up so much about our Humanity I'm going

[1:44:22] molding and shaping me into the image of

[1:45:22] about boys becoming men different things
[1:45:24] from a Christian perspective
[1:45:26] and and the author says you know
[1:45:28] Christianity is not just telling people
[1:45:29] to be good
[1:45:31] you know the gospel is not just to be a
[1:45:33] good person
[1:45:34] that you know Jesus did not die or
[1:45:36] wasn't crucified because he told people
[1:45:38] to be good
[1:45:39] no he was crucified because he
[1:45:42] identified in the scripture who he was
[1:45:43] that's why the battle came but
[1:45:45] Christianity is not some Suburban lot
[1:45:47] that we live in that's just here's the
[1:45:49] boundaries and it's it's all it's all uh
[1:45:52] sterile and boring and no that's not
[1:45:54] Christianity Christianity is is
[1:45:55] Adventure it's a battle it's going into
[1:45:58] the Wilderness it's it's going into
[1:45:59] Uncharted places that's really what
[1:46:01] Christianity is it's not some boring you
[1:46:03] know we shouldn't be bored in church we
[1:46:06] shouldn't be bored with the word it
[1:46:07] should be exciting because we're walking
[1:46:08] with God he leads us into into sometimes
[1:46:11] very rugged places very even Dark Places
[1:46:13] bright places where it is but it's an
[1:46:14] adventure right it's an Uncharted it's
[1:46:17] going into Uncharted places brother Ram
[1:46:19] says there's untapped resources in God
[1:46:21] their people have never tapped into in
[1:46:23] his words what's that uncharted waters
[1:46:24] in a way
[1:46:25] so we should just say well Christianity
[1:46:27] is boring and we see it all and there's
[1:46:28] the fence and there's the house and
[1:46:30] there's the dog and no it's not Suburban
[1:46:32] never get in your mind that it's just
[1:46:34] this is all no there's far more to God
[1:46:35] than we have
[1:46:36] right his word this is all sitting here
[1:46:38] it could be sitting here for thousands
[1:46:40] of years but he'll take a predestinated
[1:46:42] vessel Quicken it to him and make it
[1:46:44] live why can't we be those kind of
[1:46:46] people the word has come open in this
[1:46:48] day and not the messages open the word
[1:46:49] right so there's parts of God that have
[1:46:52] been hidden for ages but now it's become
[1:46:53] into full manifestation amen so we
[1:46:56] should never be bought
