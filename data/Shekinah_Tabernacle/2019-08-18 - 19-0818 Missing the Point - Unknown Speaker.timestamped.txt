[24:43] is this for me or is the lighted way
[25:00] okay are we all in position okay here we
[25:18] go the lighted way and we've got Fred
[25:20] Fred come on out right out in the front
[25:23] hi Fred Fred had been sent on an errand
[25:27] to his uncle's farm he thought he knew
[25:29] the way well as it had been described in
[25:31] detail to him by his parents but as the
[25:33] shades of evening gathered he began to
[25:35] get a little anxious I should have been
[25:39] there alone I should have been there a
[25:41] long time ago he said to himself I must
[25:43] have taken the wrong road somewhere I
[25:45] wish someone would come along whom I
[25:48] could ask but nobody came when darkness
[25:52] fell half hour later Fred was standing
[25:57] in the midst of a woods without the
[25:59] faintest idea which way to go well I'm
[26:02] in a fix he said to himself what shall I
[26:05] do
[26:06] in this other darkness he could not find
[26:08] I can not find my way back home let
[26:11] alone go to my uncle's farm for some
[26:14] minutes he stood still thinking a bit
[26:17] afraid there's one thing I can do he
[26:20] said to himself by and by but I wonder
[26:23] if it will make any difference a moment
[26:28] or two later he shut his eyes put his
[26:31] hands together and asked Jesus to show
[26:34] him the way out of the woods to his
[26:36] uncle's farm when he opened his eyes the
[26:42] first thing he noticed was what seemed
[26:45] to be a path of light through the trees
[26:53] strange he thought I never saw that
[26:55] before what does it mean anyhow I'll
[26:58] follow it I'll follow it when it cm so
[27:05] on he went following the glow of light
[27:07] and Teller last he was out of the woods
[27:13] when he ceased yeah when it ceased yep
[27:18] they turn off the light now he saw
[27:23] another light in the distance and walked
[27:26] towards it I'll just wait for our props
[27:32] to come back this way awesome you're
[27:41] coming to the farmhouse how yep when he
[27:45] found it came from the farmhouse he
[27:47] quickened his steps where he saw it was
[27:48] his uncle's farm how happy he was to get
[27:51] there without any mishap all safe and
[27:54] sound but the path of light in the woods
[27:58] he said to his uncle as they talked over
[28:00] experience his experience that evening
[28:02] how did it come to be there lo worms
[28:05] said his uncle smiling and so it was but
[28:09] God can use even glow worms to answer a
[28:12] little boys prayer
[28:16] [Applause]
[28:21] yeah and I know there was a couple of
[28:23] stories not just that testimony my
[28:24] husband has one where he was lost and he
[28:27] grew up in a prayerful family and you
[28:29] two go to the Lord and he got out from
[28:31] being lost as well were you with your
[28:33] brothers yeah with his brothers so we
[28:36] don't have anything to be afraid of okay
[28:39] now the next one we need okay all right
[28:57] we'll just give out our props that was
[29:02] another thing we did we practiced in our
[29:04] room we did practice out here so thank
[29:06] you for being with us here we go in a
[30:07] humble cottage friends and a humble
[30:10] cottage and friends the poor by body men
[30:12] was dying oh you'll have to give me some
[30:15] grace - because Pauline is only son to
[30:23] him he said my many troubles will come
[30:29] to you in this world but always remember
[30:32] that all comes from above then you will
[30:35] find it easier to bear everything with
[30:38] patience shortly after this poor man
[30:42] died and little Peter found himself
[30:44] quite alone in the world
[30:46] the only thing he could do for a living
[30:48] was to go out and beg as he went from
[31:08] door to door in the villages he would
[31:10] sing to the people receiving from them
[31:11] just enough to keep them alive to keep
[31:14] him alive every time anybody gave him
[31:16] some food or money he used to say it
[31:19] comes from above remembering his
[31:22] father's last words thank you girls you
[31:25] can sit down
[31:26] it became a habit with him to use these
[31:28] words whenever it whatever happened to
[31:31] him and he found that they did indeed
[31:33] help him to bear everything with
[31:35] patience ready Abraham you ready to
[31:38] stand up Jonathan you got the sheet
[31:41] ready yep guys stand on your chair okay
[31:45] we had to get a sponge something soft
[31:48] for Abraham to throw you'll you'll
[31:50] realize why one day
[31:53] he was passing through a village a
[31:54] sudden gust of wind blew a tile off a
[31:59] nearby house it's struck Peter on the
[32:03] shoulder knocking him to the ground it
[32:07] comes from above where his first words
[32:11] as he regained his feet at which you can
[32:13] imagine the by standards laughed
[32:16] heartily Hey a minute later however
[32:32] another gust of wind tore off the entire
[32:35] roof off of called it a little further
[32:37] down the street had little Peter gone on
[32:42] he might have been killed by it so he
[32:45] thought to himself that tile had that
[32:47] had struck him and hurt him
[32:49] had indeed come from above on another
[32:53] occasion um on another occasion little
[32:58] Peter ready ready with the first prop
[33:02] put that one down that one's for later
[33:10] on another occasion little Peter was
[33:14] employed by a wealthy gentleman to carry
[33:17] an important letter to a businessman in
[33:19] a neighboring town as he was told to be
[33:22] quick Peter ran as fast as he could
[33:24] coming to a stream he tried to jump over
[33:27] it but alas he fell in and was nearly
[33:29] drowned when he finally climbed out onto
[33:32] the bank drenched and weary he found
[33:34] that the precious letter had disappeared
[33:37] try as he would he could not find it in
[33:40] the muddy water
[33:42] [Music]
[33:45] sadly made his way back to the rich
[33:48] gentleman's house naturally enough the
[33:51] gentleman was very angry with him in
[33:53] fact he drove him out of the house with
[33:55] a stick but all Peter would say was it
[34:00] comes from above next day however the
[34:04] gentleman sent for him
[34:06] yes yes you are falling into the stream
[34:13] was a fortunate accident for me oh he
[34:16] said something changed overnight if that
[34:19] letter had been delivered
[34:21] I should have suffered a serious loss
[34:23] please accept this little gift as a
[34:25] token of my gratitude and the gentleman
[34:28] put more money turned towards the
[34:31] audience ribbon more money into his hand
[34:37] um then he had seen for many a long day
[34:41] it comes from above he said as he went
[34:45] down the steps smiling
[34:50] thus Peter grew up always believing that
[34:53] the hand of God was ordering his life
[34:55] confident that all things work together
[34:58] for the good that loved God one day he
[35:01] too became a successful business men
[35:04] happy are the boys and girls who have
[35:06] such faith in their Heavenly Father it
[35:08] will save the many needless sorrows and
[35:11] fill their hearts with peace and
[35:12] confidence that nothing can disturb why
[35:16] not see how it works for you hey we're
[35:19] not finished just yet sorry everyone so

[55:05] Christ's name Amen amen god bless your
[55:08] friends you may have your seats this
[55:10] morning I
[55:11] take a I want to take just the scripture
[55:14] and I was just one verse but brother
[55:16] Brown says you know it's not the size of
[55:17] the reading that matters it's what's in
[55:19] there that matters and I want to take a
[55:21] I thought a little thought this morning
[55:24] about missing the point you know we can
[55:28] all agree this Pharisee missed the point
[55:30] of being in the presence of Jesus he
[55:32] missed the point of inviting him to his
[55:34] house just think about it the lord of
[55:37] glory he invited him to come come to
[55:39] this feast I'm putting on he missed the
[55:42] point of him being there now I fell to
[55:44] understand the essential or important
[55:46] part of something so that's the missed
[55:48] the point as to to overlook or fail to
[55:52] understand the essential or important
[55:55] part of something so I pray none of us
[55:57] missed the point of this word none of us
[56:01] missed the point of Jesus and how much
[56:03] none of us missed the point I mean so
[56:05] you know who's ever felt that when you
[56:08] try and speak to someone they don't
[56:09] really understand what you're trying to
[56:11] tell them who's you know who's ever
[56:13] tried yo you talk to Mum you talk to dad
[56:15] you try you got something on your heart
[56:17] you try and convey it and they you just
[56:19] say they don't really understand they're
[56:21] missing the point
[56:22] hello children amen here yo who's ever
[56:26] felt that you know children I'm sure you
[56:28] felt that many times you want maybe you
[56:30] can't even put it on words quite right
[56:32] but they don't just quite catch what
[56:33] you're saying they are missing the point
[56:36] I mean they don't seem to parents don't
[56:38] seem to understand you know what you're
[56:41] trying to say and yeah I know that this
[56:43] is even more true from parents to
[56:45] children you know don't do this you know
[56:48] say please say thank you you know big
[56:51] kind stop being mean to your brother or
[56:53] sister stop you know and and you know
[56:56] stop whining you know whereas my parents
[56:58] will say stop being a bleacher bum you
[57:00] know stop stopped and you know the thing
[57:02] is many times and parents can say I mean
[57:05] silently I mean the children missed the
[57:08] point of what we're trying to tell them
[57:10] I mean because the point of it is not
[57:12] rules and do's and don'ts but we want
[57:14] our children to be decent human beings I
[57:17] mean that a kind that Icarus that a
[57:19] thoughtful I mean that a giving that a
[57:21] loving that a warm friendly open that
[57:24] while we say say please say thank you
[57:26] thank the person do this yo don't chew
[57:29] with your mouth open stop you know don't
[57:31] grab all the food you know big kind
[57:32] think of one another because the point
[57:34] of it is not know you're in trouble the
[57:36] point of it is that they would become
[57:37] decent human beings but many times the
[57:39] children miss the point right you got to
[57:42] see what is the point yo your parents
[57:44] speak you say what is the you're not
[57:45] really thinking you mind what's the
[57:46] point of this what are they really
[57:48] trying to get across because you know
[57:50] our lives aren't based around telling
[57:52] you off I mean that's not our life
[57:54] school you know start wake up in the
[57:56] morning another day to tell them off
[57:58] hallelujah oh it's the weekend I've got
[58:00] all day no that's not that's not the
[58:03] point the point is we want to raise you
[58:05] to be adults and we're going to have
[58:07] that in our minds it doesn't matter how
[58:08] young they are you got to think one day
[58:10] this child is going to be an adult so
[58:13] what's the point you're trying to give
[58:15] them Alleluia the problem is though many
[58:20] people miss the point because they
[58:23] already have their mind made up I mean
[58:25] they're fixed on a certain thing or a
[58:27] certain argument and instead of actually
[58:29] listening to what they're trying to be
[58:32] told they're just waiting for the other
[58:34] person to finish so they can respond
[58:35] who's never had a conversation where
[58:38] you're talking to someone it can be very
[58:39] serious but you know they're they're
[58:41] cogs are turning in their head and they
[58:43] just waiting to give the response
[58:44] they're not really listening to what
[58:45] you're saying they're missing the point
[58:47] they're missing the point of the
[58:49] conversation because they're just
[58:50] waiting for time to speak now can I have
[58:53] the floor now basically can you just you
[58:55] know you know like who's ever been in a
[58:56] debating team we should do it at school
[58:59] sometimes you know they have certain
[59:00] time then you got your time just waiting
[59:02] you know and as they're arguing you're
[59:04] all scribbling down notes like fury I
[59:05] mean because you're just going to
[59:07] counter what they're saying that happens
[59:09] everyday life you missed the point I
[59:11] mean see now if that is and that is the
[59:15] case errors people people are the same
[59:18] that happens bride not bride save Center
[59:21] whatever people do that because we're
[59:23] all human right but how much more now
[59:26] between God and man you know God's had
[59:31] God has sent his word the mystery of God
[59:33] is finished in the stage that says in
[59:35] Revelations 10 7 a means that knows we
[59:37] know the heart of God
[59:39] Howley you should bail say I know the
[59:41] heart of God I mean this message is
[59:43] revealed the heart of God to me I mean
[59:45] so we know what he likes what he doesn't
[59:47] like we know how to live a life that
[59:49] pleases him and that is more than how we
[59:52] dress but it's how we treat our spouses
[59:55] our children each other I mean because
[59:57] that's our actions right hallelujah but
[59:59] the problem is is we have all inherited
[1:00:02] ideas that are wrong all of us have
[1:00:06] inherited something wrong doesn't matter
[1:00:08] if you're fourth generation and the
[1:00:09] message or whatever generation we've all
[1:00:12] we've all inherited something wrong I
[1:00:13] mean but the thing is now what happens
[1:00:16] is that people they take that thought
[1:00:20] that's wrong they become a believer they
[1:00:24] may wrap it around in quotes and
[1:00:26] scriptures and it just fortifies that
[1:00:28] position in their life because the
[1:00:29] Prophet said right but they miss exactly
[1:00:31] they missed the point of what he's
[1:00:33] saying I mean so you take very classic
[1:00:36] example men who are controlling
[1:00:38] domineering over their families over
[1:00:40] their wives they come into the message
[1:00:42] they hear brother for him rebuking men
[1:00:44] saying you know how do you let your
[1:00:46] wives go out and smoke and drink and
[1:00:47] dress immoral and do these things and
[1:00:49] they say Amen why cuz the nature is
[1:00:52] already in them to be controlling but
[1:00:54] now they have something to fortify you
[1:00:57] know what what you know their
[1:00:59] preconceived idea you know people people
[1:01:02] come into the message and they hear
[1:01:04] brother BAM saying that the Catholic
[1:01:06] system and all the denominations is the
[1:01:08] great harlot and the daughters they
[1:01:09] already believe it they say Amen or
[1:01:11] they've got a revelation they say no
[1:01:12] they already believe that there's
[1:01:15] something they inherited or the husband
[1:01:17] is the head of the home amen I'm in
[1:01:19] charge now they just inherited that
[1:01:21] right but they missed the point of how
[1:01:25] actually to be the head of the home amen
[1:01:30] you see the Lord you see husbands and
[1:01:33] men to be like God as to the church does
[1:01:35] Jesus come to you and say you'd better
[1:01:37] line up Sonny Boy I'm gonna burn you
[1:01:39] alive you're gonna you know he doesn't
[1:01:41] browbeat us he following me he doesn't
[1:01:44] bring his fear and yo check us and
[1:01:47] living in you know torment and worry and
[1:01:49] what's going to happen I'm gonna be lost
[1:01:51] so I got a tow the line no
[1:01:53] you know if that's your relationship
[1:01:55] with God you need to change the
[1:01:56] relationship your your actually so
[1:01:58] following the wrong ones I mean because
[1:02:01] he motivates us by divine love and when
[1:02:04] he motivates us by divine love he
[1:02:05] changes our heart he changes our
[1:02:07] thinking so he we line up with his word
[1:02:09] because of love and not of fear right
[1:02:12] but if but if someone hears quotes about
[1:02:14] how to rule their home and how do you
[1:02:16] let your wife do so and so I mean then
[1:02:18] what they do is because they only have
[1:02:20] that preconceived idea being domineering
[1:02:22] then they try and force them to conform
[1:02:24] to the word but they've missed the point
[1:02:27] because the point is you get the Holy
[1:02:30] Ghost in your life I mean and let let
[1:02:33] the Holy Ghost manifest his life through
[1:02:35] you because it happens unconsciously
[1:02:36] it's not you consciously or I'm anointed
[1:02:38] now no God is a you know if he's in you
[1:02:40] you always anointed if he's in you he's
[1:02:42] always manifesting hallelujah so it's
[1:02:45] the life and you exchange and that life
[1:02:47] will go down down into your family and
[1:02:48] they will begin to line up with the word
[1:02:50] of God hallelujah want God to yo do a
[1:02:53] house clean in your house pray until he
[1:02:55] comes down
[1:02:56] I mean don't just kick it out and leave
[1:02:58] the void and I let God fill the void
[1:03:00] hallelujah sure you go to throwing stuff
[1:03:03] out but God's got to go fill their void
[1:03:05] otherwise you just have a bunch of
[1:03:06] people receiving what you're doing
[1:03:07] because their hearts had changed yeah
[1:03:09] they're both you follow me so so many
[1:03:12] people miss the point of the word
[1:03:17] because they have their own arguments in
[1:03:19] their mind surrounded by quotes and
[1:03:21] scriptures but if we really have the
[1:03:23] Holy Ghost then we do not hold and then
[1:03:26] when the word comes we can't hold onto
[1:03:28] our own our own arguments anymore
[1:03:30] because we receive because revelation as
[1:03:34] God's thoughts coming unto you
[1:03:36] so how he thinks about his word is how
[1:03:39] you think about his work because the
[1:03:40] same one that wrote the word comes into
[1:03:42] you and manifests the word that's
[1:03:44] revelation revelation is not well I
[1:03:46] understand it mentally no God's thoughts
[1:03:48] this multitude they have different
[1:03:50] thoughts on the scripture but when the
[1:03:52] author comes hallelujah comes unto you
[1:03:55] then you receive the revelation of the
[1:03:57] scripture hallelujah amen the thing is
[1:04:01] it says now proverbs 20:1 I'm going to
[1:04:04] come to Simon the Pharisee we're gonna
[1:04:06] it's going to go like this we're going
[1:04:07] to get
[1:04:07] okay amen proverbs 21:2 every every way
[1:04:11] of a man is right in his own eyes but
[1:04:13] God pondereth the hearts this word
[1:04:16] pondereth means to balance that is to
[1:04:18] measure out figuratively to arrange or
[1:04:21] to equalize I thought Lord balanced my
[1:04:24] you and your heart as your emotions so
[1:04:26] Lord balance ponder my heart wholly a
[1:04:29] balance at pellit your balance my
[1:04:31] emotions arrange them equalizing by your
[1:04:33] word holy it's how we should be Amen now
[1:04:37] I'm sure you can agree that when Jesus
[1:04:40] came to the earth and his first coming
[1:04:43] the religious world of the Jews missed
[1:04:46] the point of the law they had missed the
[1:04:50] point of being under the blood of bulls
[1:04:53] and goats there were promises in the law
[1:04:56] that if Israel would love the Lord with
[1:04:58] all their hearts and serve him according
[1:05:00] to his word they would and here at the
[1:05:01] land they would dwell that have pc1
[1:05:04] would be under his fig tree or vineyard
[1:05:06] you know that have peace in their land
[1:05:07] that was the point of the law that God
[1:05:09] would come down and walk among his
[1:05:11] children that was the point wasn't it
[1:05:14] that's the point but the thing is by the
[1:05:16] time Jesus came there was no cry like
[1:05:20] there was from Gideon if God is with us
[1:05:21] where as miracles
[1:05:23] that cry had gone they weren't looking
[1:05:25] where is the God that was with Moses
[1:05:27] they see where Moses disciples but they
[1:05:29] weren't Moses disciples because if their
[1:05:31] Moses disciples the god of Moses would
[1:05:33] have been their God so the same one that
[1:05:35] delivered back then would have delivered
[1:05:37] him in that day but they had long
[1:05:38] forgotten the point of God delivering
[1:05:41] them they had long forgotten what God
[1:05:43] did for them and they were now just this
[1:05:45] political way here we're going to keep
[1:05:46] our you know keep our nation intact and
[1:05:48] keep our you know carry favor with the
[1:05:50] Romans and all that it was all
[1:05:52] politically minded
[1:05:53] there's no deliverance is no power
[1:05:54] there's no freedom they were under the
[1:05:56] yoke of Rome they missed the point
[1:05:59] Amen we don't want to miss the point it
[1:06:03] had become the the law had become a dead
[1:06:07] ritual just a tradition amen
[1:06:10] Matthew said it I mean sorry Jesus said
[1:06:12] in Matthew 23 5 but but all their works
[1:06:15] they do are too poor to be seen of men
[1:06:19] they make broad their
[1:06:22] whatever they are fella sorry I don't
[1:06:26] know I can't really and enlarge the
[1:06:28] borders of their garments and love the
[1:06:30] uttermost room at feasts and the chief
[1:06:32] seats in the synagogues and the
[1:06:33] greetings in the markets and to be
[1:06:35] called of men rabbi rabbi but be not
[1:06:38] called rabbi for one is your master even
[1:06:40] Christ and all ye are brethren so this
[1:06:44] was the point this is what they thought
[1:06:46] the law was this is the point but they
[1:06:48] thought of you know being a Pharisee
[1:06:50] being a said you see people would think
[1:06:52] highly of them look how great I am look
[1:06:54] at what I do that wasn't the point
[1:06:57] the point was God would dwell among them
[1:06:59] God would fight their battles God would
[1:07:01] manifest his glory that was the point
[1:07:03] but they missed the point
[1:07:04] they forgot the significance of the
[1:07:06] importance of it Jesus says in Matthew
[1:07:10] 23:23 further down the same chapter well
[1:07:12] won't you scribes and Pharisees
[1:07:14] hypocrites for ye pay tithes of mint and
[1:07:16] anise and cummin and have omitted the
[1:07:19] weightier matters of the law judgment
[1:07:21] mercy and faith why did they admit these
[1:07:25] things I'll say because they missed the
[1:07:27] point of them they missed the importance
[1:07:29] of them do you think those the most
[1:07:31] important things Lord's judgment mercy
[1:07:33] and faith but they admitted them they're
[1:07:35] all about surface stuff well I type this
[1:07:38] I do this I do this none of those things
[1:07:41] are necessary wrong but they missed the
[1:07:42] point
[1:07:43] hallelujah these you ought to have done
[1:07:46] and to leave the other undone
[1:07:49] he says you blind guides which strain at
[1:07:51] a gnat and swallow a camel they missed
[1:07:53] the point
[1:07:54] are we all on the same you can agree you
[1:07:57] say man those guys are crazy they missed
[1:07:58] the point
[1:07:59] the same God that was with Gideon should
[1:08:01] have been with them that's a good
[1:08:03] question if God is with us where is his
[1:08:04] power
[1:08:05] where's his miracles where's his
[1:08:07] deliverance where's the reality of his
[1:08:08] first poly Raffy still God let him be
[1:08:11] God and he is still God hallelujah amen
[1:08:17] now the gee-gees that got y'all just oh
[1:08:21] yeah I was studying this last I make me
[1:08:24] so sad it's so ridiculous
[1:08:27] you know you take John six Jesus feeds
[1:08:31] the multitudes previously crosses the
[1:08:34] sea and they
[1:08:35] follow him across the sea and he says
[1:08:37] you didn't come because you saw miracles
[1:08:38] but because you didn't eat of the loaves
[1:08:40] and were filled
[1:08:42] so they got a free lunch they wanted
[1:08:44] another free lunch they missed the point
[1:08:46] here was the Messiah upon the earth for
[1:08:49] one they're looking for
[1:08:50] the woman was prophesied from the Garden
[1:08:52] of Eden and they wanted free lunch My
[1:08:55] Lord Jesus think about it just let it
[1:08:57] just just think they miss the point of
[1:08:59] them being there where's the food
[1:09:02] see I'm not here for food I'm here that
[1:09:05] your sins will be washed away I've been
[1:09:06] here you go to glory I mean you don't
[1:09:08] have to be under the law and you're
[1:09:10] kinda lazy you be delivered you be born
[1:09:12] again there was the point but they
[1:09:15] missed the point
[1:09:16] my they thought the point of him being
[1:09:20] there was free food they were looking
[1:09:23] for natural blessings same thing today
[1:09:25] people are Christians because you know
[1:09:27] people preach the promise of prosperity
[1:09:29] and that started an eye about the
[1:09:32] mid-fifties people begin to preach about
[1:09:34] prosperity gospel and people became
[1:09:37] Christians because God because I said if
[1:09:39] you become a Christian God will bless
[1:09:41] you oh I want a big house I want a big
[1:09:44] car on they missed the point they missed
[1:09:48] the point of being a believer I mean the
[1:09:50] point of the believer being a believer
[1:09:51] is not how rich you can be or whatever
[1:09:53] no the point is that you have eternal
[1:09:55] life
[1:09:56] that's the point probably that God can
[1:09:59] manifest this word through you to a
[1:10:01] dying world that's the point that God
[1:10:04] can come and dwell in you manifest
[1:10:06] themselves that's the point I mean but
[1:10:09] they but people go chasing money and all
[1:10:11] these big money-making schemes it's
[1:10:14] gonna burn it's not gonna be a memory
[1:10:18] polio you know when we are on the other
[1:10:21] side I believe we will be and we're
[1:10:24] fellowshipping about the days when do
[1:10:26] you think we're gonna remember well I
[1:10:27] you know this is the size house I had
[1:10:30] and my car broke down here and they
[1:10:32] don't know we're gonna be talking about
[1:10:34] what God did for us what he did he did
[1:10:37] it here he delivered me here he saved me
[1:10:38] here he healed me here he got a hold of
[1:10:40] this one here that's what we're gonna be
[1:10:42] talking about those are things we're
[1:10:44] going to remember we're not gonna
[1:10:45] remember the car and the wish I got this
[1:10:47] car and
[1:10:47] you know let's not miss the point
[1:10:51] haloo yeah nothing wrong with wanting a
[1:10:54] bigger house whatever but the point of
[1:10:56] being a Christian is not those things
[1:10:58] right brother Ram says God's blessing is
[1:11:01] not necessary reflected and being rich
[1:11:02] or poor that's irrelevant amen
[1:11:07] if you're rich praise the Lord of your
[1:11:08] poor praise the Lord whatever content
[1:11:09] state you find yourself and be content
[1:11:12] for that is the will of God concerning
[1:11:14] you
[1:11:15] hallelujah you know as I said you know
[1:11:18] your Papua New Guinea people scavenging
[1:11:20] out of the rubbish dump looking for
[1:11:22] Elementium cans to to buy yo to sell to
[1:11:25] recycle to get money that were happy
[1:11:27] they went walking under will move to do
[1:11:30] this again today this is dumb know that
[1:11:32] were hippie you drive along like hi how
[1:11:34] are you honey
[1:11:36] having done that were happy they weren't
[1:11:39] ashamed you know they weren't like that
[1:11:41] no why because they were content you
[1:11:44] know we should be content in the Lord
[1:11:47] hallelujah
[1:11:48] I have eternal life I have everything I
[1:11:51] want it all hallelujah
[1:11:53] what else do I need I met his brother
[1:11:56] Isaac's you don't we say what's the
[1:11:58] worst thing that happened you die and
[1:11:59] death is just a travel bus to get you
[1:12:01] where you want to go hallelujah so why
[1:12:04] do we need to worry hallelujah
[1:12:07] so I think we should just not miss the
[1:12:09] point where we should catch the point
[1:12:11] hallelujah
[1:12:13] so a Christian is a Christian because
[1:12:15] they receive eternal life and they
[1:12:17] believe him no matter what happens you
[1:12:19] know I'm not a believer because things
[1:12:21] go well and when things go bad I quit
[1:12:23] well I throw attention so God didn't do
[1:12:25] this movie you know people get angry at
[1:12:27] God they justify themselves
[1:12:29] what are you lil boosie doodle-ooh
[1:12:30] you're they fuss they throw tantrums you
[1:12:33] know doesn't change God barely robbed
[1:12:35] themselves really and if they could look
[1:12:37] at themselves I think men you bring an
[1:12:38] egg you're being ridiculous you know
[1:12:41] sometimes I won't name a name this three
[1:12:44] than their you know they get on the
[1:12:46] ground they cry they first you know what
[1:12:48] I do sometimes I get down on the ground
[1:12:49] I cry and fast with them and they stop
[1:12:51] and they're like you know and I just say
[1:12:55] this is what you look like you know yes
[1:12:57] it doesn't daddy look ridiculously like
[1:12:58] years like well that's what you look
[1:13:00] like
[1:13:01] and sometimes we need to really think
[1:13:02] man we get angry angry at God what's he
[1:13:06] ever done
[1:13:06] oh he just died for eternal life for you
[1:13:10] oh oh he owes me something he doesn't
[1:13:13] owe you nothing
[1:13:14] you know oh you better do this otherwise
[1:13:16] I'm not gonna follow you anymore you
[1:13:19] missed the point something a spoiled
[1:13:21] child
[1:13:22] you know you know I heard a testimony
[1:13:26] from foxes Book of Martyrs there's a guy
[1:13:28] and he's about to be burnt at the stake
[1:13:31] and he recanted there's a 17 year old
[1:13:33] girl and and she said youthful watching
[1:13:37] it she as a believer
[1:13:38] said you fool you you you traded eternal
[1:13:41] life just for a few maybe years of
[1:13:43] pleasure and she took his place at the
[1:13:45] stake because he missed the point we
[1:13:49] don't want to miss the point
[1:13:51] hallelujah Amen brother BAM tells our
[1:13:57] story in the message Messiah 1961 about
[1:14:01] a mother in Germany he says a little
[1:14:05] mother standing near her baby died over
[1:14:07] in Germany her husband's a chaplain and
[1:14:09] they called up long distance about five
[1:14:11] times through a day and night to ask me
[1:14:13] to come see they know that God would
[1:14:15] raise a little baby up I said let me go
[1:14:19] pray and he and I went and prayed and
[1:14:21] prayed that afternoon that night and
[1:14:23] I'll show you you whether the doctors
[1:14:25] believe or not when she already gave the
[1:14:27] dumb she already gave give the doctor my
[1:14:30] book to read I believe it's called
[1:14:31] profit visit South Africa something like
[1:14:33] that she said God will raise the baby up
[1:14:36] the little mother said God will raise
[1:14:37] the baby up and the baby had been dead
[1:14:39] before they knowed it about four or five
[1:14:41] hours so they got the father word down
[1:14:44] to the base where he was and the baby
[1:14:46] had been dead died that night and so the
[1:14:48] doctor said all right I'll tell you what
[1:14:50] I'll do
[1:14:50] I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back
[1:14:52] on and he let the baby lady for two days
[1:14:55] with the oxygen turned on at waiting
[1:14:56] and I was over there praying they were
[1:15:00] going to fly me across with a jet they
[1:15:03] could leave here with an immediate come
[1:15:05] back the same day to Germany and one
[1:15:06] morning about daylight I got up and the
[1:15:08] wife went out of the room she went out
[1:15:10] of the room and I just woke up and I
[1:15:12] laying there a little bit directly
[1:15:14] I heard someone coming into the room and
[1:15:16] look there was something moving in the
[1:15:17] room I jumped up I said Lord what would
[1:15:20] you have your servant know he said don't
[1:15:23] rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord
[1:15:25] see so I got her on the phone I said no
[1:15:27] God has called your baby so when she
[1:15:30] come over to see us so um I'm she said
[1:15:35] what was it brother branham my weakness
[1:15:37] of faith I said you have great faith you
[1:15:40] prayed for your baby you and your
[1:15:42] husband held on to it
[1:15:44] God raised that baby and he refused to
[1:15:47] do it because he knows what's best and
[1:15:49] still you love him
[1:15:51] that's real faith anybody when mountains
[1:15:56] are moving and things can have faith but
[1:15:59] let it go backwards one time and see how
[1:16:01] it works there that's when you prove
[1:16:04] whether you got faith or not he says
[1:16:07] that's real faith hallelujah when God
[1:16:11] says no but you don't mind cuz he knows
[1:16:13] the best hallelujah
[1:16:15] she saw the point amen and we and we
[1:16:22] think we have a bad day you know you
[1:16:27] missed the point you know is that right
[1:16:31] we get all twisted up in our mind you
[1:16:33] missed the point it's not a life a
[1:16:36] flower of b2v
[1:16:37] God didn't promise us a flower bit of
[1:16:39] ease he said take up your cross deny
[1:16:40] yourself take up your cross and follow
[1:16:42] me
[1:16:43] oh that's what you've got to be willing
[1:16:45] to do some of us said we all have
[1:16:46] different kind of cross but you'd be
[1:16:48] willing to be your own cross hallelujah
[1:16:52] problem is pride stops us doing it Allu
[1:16:56] yeah Amen Jesus says in John 6 he says
[1:16:59] labor not for the meat which perishes
[1:17:01] but that meat which endureth unto
[1:17:04] everlasting life which the Son of man
[1:17:06] shall give unto you for he hath the
[1:17:09] father seal I mean so you know we're not
[1:17:12] Christians because of a free lunch
[1:17:14] hallelujah we're not here for the
[1:17:16] material things we're here because of
[1:17:18] eternal life because this word is
[1:17:21] rapturing faith in it it has eternal
[1:17:23] life I mean this word is transforming
[1:17:25] power amen
[1:17:26] why do we worship
[1:17:28] not because we gave blessings but
[1:17:29] because of who he is I mean that's why I
[1:17:31] was even because of who he is not what
[1:17:34] initially he stayed more than enough for
[1:17:36] me he died for me he redeemed me by his
[1:17:39] blood I mean he purchased me he rents
[1:17:42] from me with his own life hallelujah
[1:17:43] that's more than enough I mean if he
[1:17:46] never doesn't a single more thing for me
[1:17:47] in my life he'd already done too much
[1:17:49] Halloween's already done enough for me
[1:17:51] because I am eternal life hallelujah
[1:17:54] that's all that matters
[1:17:56] that's all that matters they'll come a
[1:17:58] time and it will that this life won't be
[1:18:01] hallelujah and we'll be dancing on
[1:18:04] streets of gold hallelujah and I often
[1:18:07] think what's the first thing I'm gonna
[1:18:08] think I'm gonna think man I'm so glad it
[1:18:10] was worth it all hallelujah I'd do it
[1:18:13] all again hallelujah to end up right
[1:18:14] here hallelujah amen
[1:18:19] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[1:18:23] about what blessings we receive he's
[1:18:27] done more than enough we're gonna focus
[1:18:29] our perspective we're gonna get the
[1:18:31] point
[1:18:32] hallelujah it's amazing let's go to Luke
[1:18:36] 22 that's what uh you know I love the
[1:18:41] Gospels I love the scripture a man
[1:18:45] that's got to Luke 22 and 20 here we are
[1:18:50] this is the Last Supper you know must be
[1:18:54] an incredible moment it's called the
[1:18:57] Last Supper because they pass over
[1:18:59] before but this Passover was a little
[1:19:01] bit different I don't know if Jesus ever
[1:19:04] ever spoke these words of their previous
[1:19:07] Passover's where he said this cup is the
[1:19:09] New Testament in my blood which is shed
[1:19:11] for you I don't know if he ever spoke
[1:19:14] those car things maybe if we could just
[1:19:15] go there you know you know for a little
[1:19:17] bit you know maybe he you know he knew
[1:19:19] he knew in the next few moments he is
[1:19:21] going to guess M&E and then it's gone to
[1:19:24] Calvary he knew where he was going you
[1:19:26] know when someone's facing something
[1:19:27] real serious they kind of change it but
[1:19:29] maybe a little bit more quiet but more
[1:19:32] serious a deeper look on their face you
[1:19:34] know so I don't know yeah I imagine
[1:19:37] Passover maybe it was a somber time but
[1:19:39] it would have been a rejoicing time too
[1:19:40] because the Death Angel passed
[1:19:41] hallelujah I mean but you know maybe he
[1:19:44] had a deeper kind of look in his face
[1:19:45] maybe he wasn't talking so much I don't
[1:19:48] know but I don't know if he ever said
[1:19:50] these words at the other suppers this
[1:19:54] was the Last Supper
[1:19:55] why wouldn't you think about it here's
[1:19:56] the disciples they've been following the
[1:19:58] Lord and he's coming to the climax of
[1:20:01] his earthly ministry he's been telling
[1:20:03] them for this cause I've come into the
[1:20:05] world I'm gonna be betrayed into the
[1:20:07] hands of wicked men I'm gonna be killed
[1:20:08] he told them these things and here they
[1:20:12] were brother Brown said they were in the
[1:20:14] greatest week in history death burial
[1:20:17] resurrection of Jesus Christ multitudes
[1:20:20] of prophecy was being fulfilled the
[1:20:22] Messiah was on the earth they were
[1:20:23] following him but if they come to this
[1:20:26] point they come to this place and he
[1:20:30] speaks these words in the next verse but
[1:20:32] behold the hand of him that betrays me
[1:20:35] is with me on the table I don't know if
[1:20:37] he ever said those before and he just
[1:20:40] through he just he just speaks it out
[1:20:41] and then they begin to ask you know he
[1:20:48] this is in the next verse and truly the
[1:20:51] Son of Man garthe's it was determined
[1:20:53] but woe unto them that man unto that man
[1:20:56] by whom he is betrayed and in the next
[1:20:59] verse they begin to acquire among
[1:21:01] themselves which of them was that they
[1:21:03] should do this thing John you think it's
[1:21:06] you Andrew they be going to talk the
[1:21:08] conversation changed but they noticed
[1:21:11] them go go next verse go down and there
[1:21:15] was also a strife among them which of
[1:21:18] them should be account at the greatest
[1:21:19] so here he is I just I just pray God
[1:21:22] just makes us look here he is this bread
[1:21:26] is broken there's my body which will be
[1:21:28] given for you do this remembrance of me
[1:21:30] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:21:32] blood
[1:21:32] drink it as often as you remember me it
[1:21:35] is now Helu you the one among you is
[1:21:39] going to betray me and they're just
[1:21:42] talking about it and then they're still
[1:21:45] fighting but this strife this debate
[1:21:47] what trans greatest know I'm the
[1:21:49] greatest the Andrew says I'm the
[1:21:51] greatest John says no I'm the greatest
[1:21:52] this strife among them God
[1:21:55] fulfilling his word the promise of the
[1:21:57] ages is about to be manifested wholly of
[1:22:00] the Messiah his blood on the
[1:22:02] earth and they are missing the point
[1:22:04] they are striving among themselves
[1:22:06] though I'm the greatest now I know the
[1:22:08] best I can do
[1:22:09] although they're missing the point
[1:22:12] they're in the greatest moment he's
[1:22:14] going to be taken not long after this
[1:22:16] holy and be crucified they were missing
[1:22:20] the point of the moment oh well we had
[1:22:23] Passover last year we're headed the year
[1:22:25] before but this was the last one this
[1:22:28] was different
[1:22:29] hallelujah and we come to church well
[1:22:32] the songs will be this long this brother
[1:22:35] will make this comment no doubt we'll
[1:22:37] sing that song because he likes it
[1:22:39] this guy will do this you missed the
[1:22:42] point our Sunday School will be like
[1:22:44] this so this teachers teaching so he's
[1:22:46] like this or she's like this Allah you
[1:22:48] know you missed the point
[1:22:50] we missed the point of gathering we
[1:22:53] missed the point of being here amen they
[1:22:57] were they were so carnal you think about
[1:22:59] it here here he is one of he's going to
[1:23:01] betray me
[1:23:02] but then the conversation changes I'm
[1:23:04] the best I'm the booster this one's the
[1:23:06] best
[1:23:06] this is deficient animosity I am among
[1:23:08] them because of carnal things and they
[1:23:10] were missing the point of being there
[1:23:16] incredible you say well how can that be
[1:23:21] how can they be so caught up in things
[1:23:24] that they missing the importance they
[1:23:27] were missing the importance of the word
[1:23:29] being fulfilled in their day right in
[1:23:31] front of their eyes people consider the
[1:23:35] presence of the Lord and because they
[1:23:37] are so obsessed with their own situation
[1:23:40] what people have done to them what their
[1:23:43] family has done to them how much money
[1:23:45] they have or they don't have their pain
[1:23:47] they carry the suffering they have gone
[1:23:49] through they miss the point
[1:23:52] they miss the importance of being in the
[1:23:54] presence of God they miss their moment
[1:23:56] of deliverance that's true we can be so
[1:24:00] self-absorbed in our own lives and
[1:24:02] what's going this person is my brother
[1:24:04] did this my sister this my
[1:24:05] does this my dad doesn't you miss the
[1:24:08] point of sitting even here right this
[1:24:10] morning and this happened in my past and
[1:24:12] this person said this and this person
[1:24:14] looked at me this way and people get so
[1:24:15] obsessed with themselves they miss their
[1:24:19] deliverance you say you sure about that

[1:25:24] I've never seen the woman in my life do
[1:25:26] you believe it if that isn't the same
[1:25:28] Jesus that once lived I don't know I'm a
[1:25:30] man do you believe receive him here was
[1:25:32] a woman she had her she was suffering
[1:25:35] with the condition on her breast she had
[1:25:37] three operations so she had this paint
[1:25:40] you're suffering with this physical
[1:25:42] sickness she was missing and he was the
[1:25:46] son of man he think just just think
[1:25:48] about this many times he said wouldn't
[1:25:50] it be wonderful to be in those meanings
[1:25:51] God comes my brother says I'm just a man
[1:25:54] I'm just your brother I'm waiting for
[1:25:55] him to come angel the Lord comes down
[1:25:57] reveals that you know manifests the
[1:25:59] thoughts intents of the hearts of the
[1:26:00] people reveals them to show that the
[1:26:02] word that's has gone forth is God amen
[1:26:06] and here she is she's being called out
[1:26:07] right down to the specific details and
[1:26:11] she's missing it why cuz she's sitting
[1:26:15] with her own pain and suffering missing
[1:26:17] what God is doing
[1:26:19] it was God's grace that called her name
[1:26:21] oh my lord
[1:26:23] think about it we don't want to miss the
[1:26:26] point she was missing the point of the
[1:26:28] service amen and he's the same God today
[1:26:32] I mean why do we come to church why are
[1:26:34] we in his presence let's not miss the
[1:26:36] point although all the season of our
[1:26:38] deliverance you have the devil always
[1:26:40] the devil will never say believe it say
[1:26:42] yes amen that's why what happens is you
[1:26:44] got to see the point of saying amen
[1:26:45] it's not just to be loud I mean but when
[1:26:48] you say men you're receiving that word
[1:26:49] and that word I mean that powers
[1:26:51] released into your life I mean and you
[1:26:54] get what you need I mean by agreeing
[1:26:56] Amen you're connecting your faith with
[1:26:58] that word and there's power released and
[1:27:00] it helps you that's why it's important
[1:27:03] to say yes
[1:27:04] doesn't matter how loud you can be quite
[1:27:06] as nobody say amen amen
[1:27:12] as I said when I was prayed for it to
[1:27:14] camp down in Christchurch brother Craig
[1:27:16] boss said no go believe what you receive
[1:27:18] I said I receive it and the anointing
[1:27:20] came down and I had a jubilee hallelujah
[1:27:23] what if I just didn't say anything
[1:27:26] he said go receive us say well I receive
[1:27:28] it now God came down and join t'me I
[1:27:30] knew I'd received it I'm still living
[1:27:32] under that receiving holy I said I want
[1:27:34] a revival in a row for the church

[1:27:49] you're here to speak to me God I don't
[1:27:51] want to let my own suffering and pain
[1:27:53] make me miss the point hallelujah amen
[1:27:58] oh yeah now let's go back to Simon the
[1:28:03] Pharisee you think about you think about
[1:28:08] how so many people you know we talk
[1:28:10] about blind Bartimaeus
[1:28:11] he saw the point the woman with the
[1:28:14] blood issue she saw the point
[1:28:16] Lazarus saw the point the woman at the
[1:28:18] well saw the point but so many missed
[1:28:21] the point
[1:28:21] so multitudes missed the point of him
[1:28:24] being there and here Jesus is he's been
[1:28:27] preaching you know it's been a very hot
[1:28:28] day at least and he's you know he always
[1:28:31] been ministering to the people he
[1:28:33] comes a man coming up the hill he's got
[1:28:35] a message and he's been sent from Simon
[1:28:38] the Pharisee and he's come to invite
[1:28:41] Jesus to this feast and he comes to the
[1:28:45] disciples maybe he came as as you know
[1:28:47] they were Peter James and John room you
[1:28:50] know the closest disciples but maybe it
[1:28:52] was one of the other disciples Andrew or
[1:28:54] one of them and he he you're this you're
[1:28:55] this servant pushes way through the
[1:28:57] crowd yo what's going on he's not
[1:28:59] interested in what's going on he's got a
[1:29:00] message to bring and here he is he comes
[1:29:04] to Andrew maybe says Andrew I've got a
[1:29:06] message from my master to your master
[1:29:08] Congo speak to him Andrew goes maybe
[1:29:10] speaks to Peter James and John this guy
[1:29:11] wants to speak to Jesus and they say yes
[1:29:13] and finally here comes this man he has
[1:29:18] got through the crowd he's standing
[1:29:20] right in the presence of the Son of Man
[1:29:22] and he's not far away he's right there
[1:29:25] he's looking him in the eyes and here is
[1:29:29] the very fountain of eternal life
[1:29:30] standing in front of him and all he has
[1:29:33] fixated on as hard as his message to
[1:29:35] give him he had an opportunity you think
[1:29:39] about that wouldn't that wouldn't that
[1:29:41] have been raising polio if you knew who
[1:29:44] he was back then you would have kicked
[1:29:47] people out of the way you wouldn't want
[1:29:48] to say I must get to the son of man
[1:29:51] hallelujah and here he was Jesus Simon
[1:29:55] the great Pharisee of Jerusalem has
[1:29:56] invited you to his great feast will you
[1:29:59] come and Jesus is always he always comes
[1:30:02] when he's invited he always accepts an
[1:30:06] invitation I mean brother MC you know so
[1:30:09] you can invite him to where you are
[1:30:10] right now with an open heart he'll come
[1:30:13] he'll come if you really invite him
[1:30:15] he'll come hallelujah
[1:30:18] and so here's the servant he's delivered
[1:30:22] his invitation Jesus says I'll come and
[1:30:25] he walks away thinking that he has he
[1:30:28] has fulfilled his mission but he's
[1:30:31] missed the point how many other people
[1:30:34] had a one-on-one audience not planned
[1:30:37] just push through I've got I've got this
[1:30:39] message with the Son of Man and he
[1:30:41] missed the point
[1:30:42] and it goes back put yourself there you
[1:30:45] think wouldn't that be a shame
[1:30:47] and broadband speak spaces you know know
[1:30:50] that Jesus actually felt said so this
[1:30:52] man was in my presence and he missed the
[1:30:55] point he didn't use the words miss a
[1:30:56] point but he missed the point of being
[1:30:58] in his presence and then said this man
[1:31:00] the servant goes back to his master oh
[1:31:02] great master Simon farad the Pharisee I
[1:31:05] delivered your message as you have
[1:31:07] commanded and Jesus of Nazareth says he
[1:31:09] shall come and he thinks he's done is
[1:31:13] done is laden life he's missed the point
[1:31:15] I mean so then Jesus maybe maybe no
[1:31:18] doubt as you know his disciples are
[1:31:20] speaking to him saying Jesus why are you
[1:31:22] going to this man's house
[1:31:23] he's a Pharisee he doesn't care you know
[1:31:26] and Jesus said well he invited me so
[1:31:28] I'll come doesn't matter how he treats
[1:31:30] me I'm gonna go don't put him in the
[1:31:33] corner with unwashed feet and then here
[1:31:36] he comes you know this is a great feast
[1:31:38] so it wasn't just Jesus going the great
[1:31:40] celebrities of Jerusalem maybe in their
[1:31:41] chariots trumpeters going to make way
[1:31:44] for whoever who have a great name fancy
[1:31:47] pence man you know here they come this
[1:31:50] great fanfare they come out there's one
[1:31:53] door into the feast come in good sir
[1:31:56] you know feet awashed they get anointed
[1:31:59] kissed and made welcome and when the
[1:32:03] servant goes back before the feast
[1:32:04] starts he tells the man with the guest
[1:32:06] list at the door Jesus Nazareth is gonna
[1:32:08] come so his name is on the list he comes
[1:32:12] Jesus looked like any other man placed
[1:32:14] anchor but bad than ever who knows when
[1:32:16] he had a bath last time sweaty hot from
[1:32:18] the day his disciples can't come and he
[1:32:22] comes to the door the man with the list
[1:32:25] do you think about this so ridiculous
[1:32:28] what's your name and probably he said uh
[1:32:31] probably rather you know cuz if you see
[1:32:33] someone with a big fancy turban and
[1:32:34] golden robes if they are good sir what
[1:32:37] is your name it's so nice to have you at
[1:32:39] this feast but he sees this basically a
[1:32:41] bigger walking along short little man
[1:32:43] nothing of him that we desire he say
[1:32:45] what's your name
[1:32:46] he wouldn't have been welcoming Jesus
[1:32:49] Jesus of Nazareth coming think about it
[1:32:54] he had an opportunity here with eternal
[1:32:58] life
[1:32:59] you know that's the problem is how it
[1:33:02] presents itself is never how man thinks
[1:33:05] it should be
[1:33:05] it's the foolishness of preaching the
[1:33:08] scripture says it's foolish but you to
[1:33:10] them that believe it's eternal life
[1:33:13] hallelujah so to the believer it is not
[1:33:16] foolish it's precious I mean when God
[1:33:18] comes down into a meeting and manifests
[1:33:21] himself it is glorious hallelujah but
[1:33:24] somehow Jesus comes to the door the foot
[1:33:26] foot wash flunky maybe moves his bowl to
[1:33:29] one side I am washing his feet he missed
[1:33:34] the point
[1:33:35] imagine those sacred feet I believe in
[1:33:39] half our religion so if I cry a little
[1:33:40] bit well he's got to put up with it he
[1:33:43] gets to watch the Messiah's feet
[1:33:45] haloo yeah but he missed the point he
[1:33:50] washed the other guy's feet well not
[1:33:52] this man look at him pulls the ball to
[1:33:54] one side Jesus keeps walking in the man
[1:33:57] with the anointing spices in oil well
[1:33:59] I'm not anointing this guy stinks missed
[1:34:02] the point
[1:34:03] measured anointing the word hallelujah
[1:34:05] Mary Mary anointed him for his burial
[1:34:08] Pauline is going to be a woman on the
[1:34:10] earth that night's the word hallelujah
[1:34:13] what's next part I'm in miles over you
[1:34:15] miles away me how do you anoint him you
[1:34:17] say Amen yes Lord I believe it
[1:34:20] hallelujah that's how you anoint the
[1:34:22] word
[1:34:23] I mean don't look at me funny if I'm
[1:34:24] screaming I mean you know but but I'm
[1:34:27] not anointing this guy and where's the
[1:34:29] kiss to be made welcome but he goes
[1:34:33] where he's invited you know this is
[1:34:37] going to be played before those people
[1:34:40] at the great throne great white throne
[1:34:42] judgment and we will look at it we'll
[1:34:44] think that was the most ridiculous
[1:34:47] saddest life that has ever been because
[1:34:51] they miss the point
[1:34:53] amen Jesus just was in his earthly
[1:34:55] ministry three and a half years they had
[1:34:57] a moment they had their moment but they
[1:35:00] said now this guy stinks went you know
[1:35:02] do you know why they missed the point
[1:35:04] because Simon the Pharisee told them to
[1:35:08] miss the point and they would rather
[1:35:11] listen to the master
[1:35:13] and reject the word then anoint him and
[1:35:16] make him welcome because of just because
[1:35:19] of influence
[1:35:21] that's why oh this person will think
[1:35:24] this this person says this I want to be
[1:35:26] cool with this person so I'm just gonna
[1:35:28] sit here like a stone and do nothing and
[1:35:30] not really you're missing the point I
[1:35:32] know what peer pressure's like here's a
[1:35:35] guy in my dorm rich guy from Ramiro
[1:35:37] Auckland
[1:35:38] he wasn't even my friend I thought he
[1:35:40] was cool so I started dressing like him
[1:35:42] I started trying to act like him because
[1:35:44] I thought he was cool he wasn't my
[1:35:46] friend but but it was influence
[1:35:50] hallelujah Lord was dealing with me at
[1:35:53] university I was so afraid to lose my
[1:35:55] friends because God was dealing me
[1:35:58] wilshire I became a Christian sure but I
[1:36:00] didn't want to say anything about it
[1:36:01] because I'd lose them peer pressure is
[1:36:04] real and they didn't get up every day
[1:36:07] and say there's no God and God's not
[1:36:08] real and God's did and you're stupid if
[1:36:10] you think he won't you they never they
[1:36:12] never were anti religion they never
[1:36:14] spoke about it but because of peer
[1:36:16] pressure and some of them are non since
[1:36:18] I was 15 I lived with him a boarding
[1:36:20] school but because of peer pressured
[1:36:23] helped me back so I'm in the Pharisees
[1:36:25] influence cause those people to miss the
[1:36:29] point and here's Jesus he comes to the
[1:36:35] feast and it's the greatest mother em
[1:36:40] says about the courier that that we
[1:36:43] didn't delivered the message this is in
[1:36:44] the meanest man in Santa Maria he sees a
[1:36:47] Miss Korea standing there delivered his
[1:36:49] message I can imagine how a master watch
[1:36:51] the fellow with pity thinking about
[1:36:53] perhaps that he was passing the greatest
[1:36:57] opportunity that ever labor for any
[1:36:59] human being was to stand in the presence
[1:37:01] of Jesus Christ and he is the same
[1:37:05] yesterday today and forever the same
[1:37:08] presence is here I mean we have that
[1:37:11] same we have the greatest opportunity
[1:37:14] every service and I'm not just talking
[1:37:17] about getting saved
[1:37:18] Amen but two forgot to meet her need
[1:37:21] hallelujah and his Simon the Pharisees
[1:37:24] influence making them not received
[1:37:26] word in their day that's all they had
[1:37:29] and then that Jesus in the corner made
[1:37:32] unwelcome with unwashed feet not
[1:37:35] anointed he's there but there was
[1:37:38] someone there who yeah doesn't matter
[1:37:43] God will have a witness God will have
[1:37:45] one who'll receive him hallelujah and
[1:37:48] she wasn't invited to the feast but
[1:37:51] something I don't know how she heard
[1:37:52] Jesus was there but something moved in
[1:37:54] her heart what do you mean yes unwashed
[1:37:57] feet what do you mean he's not made
[1:37:59] welcome I'm gonna do something about
[1:38:01] this hallelujah and so she took all her
[1:38:05] money she was a prostitute it doesn't
[1:38:08] matter where we're from what's what what
[1:38:10] sin was triptan oh then that's
[1:38:12] irrelevant she said I'm not gonna make
[1:38:14] him welcome Polly she takes all the
[1:38:16] money she runs the Apothecary over it
[1:38:18] was and and the man looks at her or what
[1:38:21] do you want they know he knew who she
[1:38:24] was or what do you want puts all the
[1:38:26] money on the table I want your best I
[1:38:28] want your best he's probably thinking
[1:38:31] he's play thinking I wonder what she's
[1:38:34] gonna do with this
[1:38:35] she was about to anoint the word he
[1:38:39] missed the point
[1:38:40] hallelujah people get emotional on
[1:38:42] church they begin to praise and sing God
[1:38:44] and we were the critical spirit look at
[1:38:46] him so I wonder all the air up to I
[1:38:48] wonder what's going on with him - you're
[1:38:50] missing the point you're missing the
[1:38:52] point
[1:38:52] here she is gets the greatest one maybe
[1:38:56] puts it on her Road runs hardly to the
[1:38:59] feast I don't know how she got in it
[1:39:01] doesn't matter she got in totally it's
[1:39:04] like us I don't know how I got it but
[1:39:06] that doesn't matter I got in hallelujah
[1:39:09] I got into his presence that's all that
[1:39:11] matters hallelujah
[1:39:13] and she comes along she finds where he
[1:39:16] is she's not interested in Simon the
[1:39:19] Pharisee she doesn't care about critical
[1:39:20] spirits she doesn't care what other
[1:39:22] people are doing she's not worried about
[1:39:24] anyone else and what they think
[1:39:27] hallelujah
[1:39:28] she came to where he was I need more
[1:39:30] monitor please put me up hallelujah
[1:39:31] she found where Jesus was didn't even
[1:39:34] ask permission
[1:39:36] kaalia didn't even ask permission yeah
[1:39:40] I'm gonna wash his feet
[1:39:41] took that alabaster box hallelujah
[1:39:44] broken hallelujah she didn't just tip it
[1:39:48] out a little bit say well save the box
[1:39:49] no she gave everything polish she gave
[1:39:52] her all polio then she let her long
[1:39:55] glorious head down begin to kiss his
[1:39:58] feet
[1:39:59] these were feet that had the dung of the
[1:40:01] field on them they was thinking that was
[1:40:04] sweaty they were muddy
[1:40:05] hallelujah they were dusty she didn't
[1:40:08] care these were the feet that would turn
[1:40:11] to wear someone else didn't do it but
[1:40:13] she I'm gonna do it she didn't give it
[1:40:16] wasn't giving any water
[1:40:17] she had wash them with her tears kaalia
[1:40:20] took her towels of her glorious here
[1:40:22] how is she saw the point how is she saw
[1:40:25] the point of having Jesus at the face
[1:40:27] hallelujah and she pulls out her tears
[1:40:29] washes the feet hallelujah oh yeah and
[1:40:33] then Simon the Pharisee looks over there
[1:40:37] and he seasoned as hard if that man you
[1:40:39] if he was really a prophet he would know
[1:40:42] what kind of woman was touching his feet
[1:40:45] Jesus didn't say would she he just let
[1:40:47] her do it
[1:40:48] hallelujah he said that it was hard
[1:40:52] that person doesn't deserve to do that
[1:40:55] what she even here for and he's
[1:40:57] obviously not a prophet he's not really
[1:40:58] God he would rebuke her pride of a
[1:41:03] Pharisee disgusting religious devil and
[1:41:09] Jesus says I have something to say
[1:41:12] he missed the point of what was going on
[1:41:15] this woman was going from lost to found
[1:41:18] Paulo she's gone from Senator st. Holly
[1:41:21] her sins are gonna be were washed away
[1:41:23] hallelujah she'd recognize the Son of
[1:41:25] man was there Paulo she knew there's
[1:41:28] eternal life on that match piling in
[1:41:30] eternal life from that word she didn't
[1:41:32] care about anyone else cause she saw the
[1:41:34] point Tyler she saw the importance of
[1:41:37] the word and we must see the importance
[1:41:40] of this message is eternal life it is
[1:41:43] the rapture
[1:41:44] that is the point I mean that is the
[1:41:47] point of this word Kalia it's a body
[1:41:50] change work I mean it's a parting word
[1:41:53] hallelujah I need some help here please
[1:41:55] I mean yes I can hear myself Here I am I
[1:41:57] mean that is the point of this message
[1:42:00] it is not do's and don'ts and rules and
[1:42:03] whatever it is eternal life
[1:42:05] I mean Christianity is eternal life
[1:42:07] being imparted to one another
[1:42:10] kaalia that is the point hallelujah
[1:42:15] we need you getting talked about you
[1:42:17] know we need to see the point if we miss
[1:42:21] the point we have missed everything
[1:42:23] Simon the Pharisee missed everything his
[1:42:26] career with the missus missed everything
[1:42:28] the foot wash flunky the one that
[1:42:30] anointed they missed it all and all the
[1:42:34] other guests miss the point
[1:42:36] but that woman did not she got the point
[1:42:40] hallelujah and then Jesus turns because
[1:42:45] he knows what people think Simon I have
[1:42:48] some what to say to thee
[1:42:49] oh my you don't want him Jesus to look
[1:42:53] at you like that I have some what to say
[1:42:56] to thee I mean my feet weren't washed no

[1:43:44] why because she got the point I mean the
[1:43:49] devil will never tell you what the point
[1:43:51] is I mean cuz he can't get the point he
[1:43:55] can't get eternal life hallelujah and
[1:43:59] she looked down at him at her and said
[1:44:03] though her sins will scarlet
[1:44:05] they are white as snow your sins be
[1:44:08] forgiven thee go and sin no more
[1:44:12] holy Oh hallelujah

[1:44:32] actions I'm here Kolia to anoint the
[1:44:35] Messiah hallelujah and what did she got

[1:45:00] man is walking in this generation still
[1:45:03] hallelujah and that's why we anointed
[1:45:05] that's why we say lo you pour your life
[1:45:07] out I mean when she broke the alabaster
[1:45:09] box there was a point of no return she
[1:45:13] could have put it back together she
[1:45:15] could no it's broken the life has been
[1:45:18] poured out hallelujah and it's the same
[1:45:21] thing with us you really pour your life
