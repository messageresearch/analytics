of prayer and i think of the prophet how the angel told him and taught him how to come into that spoken word i don't have to try and think how do i come into the spoken word because the angel of the lord will just show us how to do it so this is what this song is about and i said know it and sing it you more than welcome to sing it it is written the man shall not live vibrate alone but by everywhere that comes from the mouth of god [Music] by his word he gave his son for us on calvary to pay the price of sin for you and me by his words gave life unto the dead he gives hope to the hopeless soul i swear you can have the victory he has set the characters free he gave life for you and me and just one word was broken and eden that's what caused the floor it will take all of the word to bring us back to god through his last day message all his thoughts are being made known through his powers i give you back [Music] salvation he gave his life he raised the sick man from the dead he gave life and to the dead he brings hope to the hopeless souls [Music] he gave life for you and [Music] i [Music] [Music] salvation he gave life for you and me and by his word he gave life for you and me [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you sister thank you for that blessing by his word and his word alone excuse me for that you want to stand with me and worship let's sing our most recent song that we've added not today i want to sing about doubt and fear and lies not today may we enter this time of prayer thinking of that not thinking on the negative or or what is satan blocking you with but speaking it uh it's been a revelation to me recently to speak to satan and say he does not have any ground to stand on amen amen amen let's get the words up for that thank you you came to us [Music] jesus son of god [Music] pay the price my sacrifice [Music] not today not today you will leave [Music] you prevailed you made every [Music] my safety try to have your way [Music] fear speaking

well god bless you all thank you musicians thank you brother ed amen there's no place like home praise the lord god bless you all we had a real nice weekend away but it's great to no place like home praise the lord so amen god bless you amen amen i'd like to just add to brother andy's little um announcement god bless brother andy there's a lot of work going into that you know we were scratching our heads how to communicate with everyone with people jumping off whatsapp and all this different stuff and so i think we found the solution but yeah just be with us praise the lord um let's go to philippians chapter three i'm going to read a couple of scriptures and then we're going to go to matthew chapter 2. i mean philippians 3 and 12. hey man so just say amen when you're there amen so this is paul speaking here saying not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count myself not to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before i press toward the mark of the for the prize the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you amen amen then we're going to go to matthew chapter 2 we're going to read from verse 7 this is speaking of of the wise men and then we're going to go to revelations 22 we're going to read one verse there amen this kind of ties in with what brother isaac was preaching on sunday i enjoyed that amen i mean yeah i was driving actually uh up to the straw eggs on on friday and just this thought came to mind the journey is worth it this is what i'm saying at the journey and i'm talking about journey to heaven now it's worth it i mean so matthew 2 and verse 7 says then herod when he had privileged called the wise men remember his here come these foreigners they've come in with a great yeah they just burst through the gates where is he born king of the jews you know they were under expectation you know inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again though i may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy i mean they had a praise break right there harlow they had a shouting time don't you get excited when you see your destination yeah you can be sitting in the car for hours and if you're young you say we're there yet are we there yet are we there yet but then finally the destination comes hallelujah amen so they rejoice with exceeding great joy and when they came into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to here they departed into their own country another way then was going to read one more scripture revolutions revelation hey it is a revolution i think what brother bram said his little daughter becky called it the book of revolutions i mean so revelations 22 and verse 4. amen i love the end of the book don't you i see me there harlow this is my destination that's where i'm going to end up yes hallelujah and they shall see his face this is this is the lord of glory and his name shall be in their foreheads won't that be a wonderful time amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer tonight oh lord jesus lord just to think one day we're going to live that scripture out lord it's not going to be a prophecy no more it's going to be a reality lord lord we're really going to see you face to face lord and give you praise and glory lord that those who feel your spirit among us even now lord as you've been drawing us lord and but lord one day lord we don't just feel your presence like this but we'll see you face to face that's the hour we look for oh god that you'd take us away and a rapture lord and we'll walk on streets of gold lord jesus to to see you lord surely the city will be a great sight but lord you're the one we want to see so lord i pray you just take this little thought lord and bless it to our hearts father for your glory and we love you so much and we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight i mean as i said the journey is worth it must have been quite a quite a time for those wise men you know we uh we're told that they traveled a great a great distance from up in persia or you know up in the east and they traveled for about two years and they were following the star and you know no doubt you know we know journeys uh journeys have difficulty in them you know they're not always easy journeys you know sometimes kids can get real carsick then they get car sick some more and sometimes the tire can go flat there can be action it's gonna be delays and you know but as long as it's on your heart i'm going to make this journey i mean that's the thing that really matters now in order to make a journey now the i just googled what journey means and it means an act of traveling from one place to another i'm sure that wasn't a bunch of rocket science to us all but we're on a journey we're going from earth to glory they travel from one part of the earth to another part of the earth but we're not traveling this way we're traveling this way hallelujah and we are in that journey you know even even as paul would say in the book of ephesians that the lord quickening us by his spirit making us alive in him washing all our sins away making us new creatures in him you know he has translated us into the kingdom of his dear sons already we have gone on a journey right we're under the powers of darkness but now we're under the power of light amen and even he said he's caused us to sit in heavenly places in christ jesus there was once upon a time when we didn't sit in that position i mean but the lord and his grace caused us to move into that position hallelujah i mean but in order to take a journey you must believe that that place is there to travel to i would never travel to australia if i didn't believe australia was real it's very elementary but you know if if australia was just a myth i'd say i can't travel there i don't believe it's real in order and also to in order to travel somewhere you must believe you can travel there you've got to believe that you can get on a plane and it's a lot more difficult nowadays but you can still do it you can get on a plane and travel to where you want to go and in order to travel somewhere you must believe that you have the means to get there amen you gotta so so so you must believe the places there right you must believe that you can travel there and you must believe that you have uh that you have the means to travel there i mean so we believe not by tradition but by revelation that heaven is a place prepared for us right we have an eternal thoughty body waiting for us in the heavens right so so that's been revealed to us it's more than tradition it's a reality amen and then we must say we must believe that there's a heaven to go to yes that's why this message came to us i mean to to for for our lord jesus to reveal himself to us because he wanted you to know there's a place for you this is not the end of your destiny you know this is not the ending resting place for you but there's a place to go to amen and also that you have the means to get there we have the means to get there and it's not in our human ability but god's gonna pack us hallelujah the you know the you know rebecca watered some camels and those camels that she watered when when when eleazar came together those same camels packed it to her isaac and the same holy spirit that's here upon the earth that we water with praise and worship and thanksgiving that same spirit is going to pack us amen to the lord of glory hallelujah that's why it's worth it i mean to water the camels that's why it's worth it to praise the lord hallelujah return everything he does you just just just return it and praise unto him harley what's happening the the camilla being i know it's very crude expression to compare the holy ghost to a camel but yo now that camel's getting refreshed it's getting hydrated it's ready for its return journey because the reason the message came is to take a people with it because the message is jesus christ it's a person it's not a bunch of doctrine it's not even 1100 tapes it's a person being expressed it's jesus christ being expressed so he came to earth to take you to glory he didn't come to earth to set up a kingdom right physical kingdom upon the earth he came to the earth to set up a kingdom and you the kingdom of god is within you to take you into glory that's why i love it you know we speak about where in the process of the coming of the lord which we are amen because the lord himself has descended with a shout right but it's really where the process off is going because this is a secret going away amen hallelujah why are you a believer to leave hallelujah why why are we at church here to leave now humanly that doesn't make much sense here people move to a place they establish themselves because they want to stay but we're here to establish ourselves in the faith to leave we're on a journey do you believe that you have the ability to get there remember he'll carry you there rebecca didn't walk i don't believe a single inch of that journey she just sat on the camel and she heard eleazar tell her about her isaac hallelujah we're on our way we're moving hallelujah we're not staying here hallelujah i'm glad i'm glad we're on the move amen so these wise men they must have had it must have been an incredible thing that what they were looking for that star gripped them amen it gripped them you could say even they coveted the star in a way they had a desire for its there was a hunger all the other stars didn't didn't give them that kind of hunger maybe it just you know excited their minds a bit but that star spoke to them in a different way and they're only satisfied when they got to the end of their journey it's the same thing with you and i will only be satisfied when we see him when these bodies are changed you know you'll know there's always more of god for you because this body is still the same right when our bodies have changed we'll know that we have made to our destination right hallelujah amen amen that's why the apostle paul would say i want to apprehend that which has apprehended me i mean you could say that that star apprehended the wise men they were obsessed with this heavenly body moving in the heavens they had to follow it they had to focus upon it all their life and what they were doing became secondary to following the star and they followed that star all the way to where the christ child was and they rejoiced hallelujah you think about a rejoicing time when we when we step from this world to the next world that's why i think we must just start rejoicing now why not this message is said to identify people it's the bride of christ identification brother braham said that the bridegroom call will come right through this and he says i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world did it introduce jesus christ to you more than a tradition more than i'd say even more than ink on paper but a living god manifesting a living word in your life what's happened jesus christ has been introduced you and why why was he introduced you for you to leave hallelujah i'm out of here glory i don't know what kind of difficulty those wise men had i don't know if their camels blew a tyre i don't know you know i don't know if one of them hurt themselves or i don't know what kind of difficulty they had but to travel from if you just go google maps you know they didn't fly they didn't drive they didn't sit on a train they sat on a camel and a camel isn't really the most glamorous mode of transport not that i've ever been on a camel but i've been on a horse and you know it can get a bit uncomfortable but they didn't worry about that they were focused on their end goal and i could say you know if i could put words in their mouth when they laid the gold the frankincense and the mirror at the feet of jesus and they worshipped him they would have said you know what this journey was worth it this journey was really worth it even with the hardship maybe the trouble the peril whatever they had to face and say this journey was worth it i mean the queen of sheba had to travel quite a way to see solomon she just she heard about she heard about this king in israel that had this gift of wisdom and the incredible things that were going on when you know you know when people would come up in front of him and the incredible gift of you know that solomon had and something just stirred in her heart i'm gonna go see that it's a good way to be i'm gonna go check that out i'm not satisfied just by hearing what the merchants say when they travel from here and what's the news in jerusalem and you know she just said i'm gonna go see it and then when she went to go see solomon all her life was laid bare and all her hard questions were answered and you know no doubt she would have said this journey was worth it hallelujah this journey was worth it amen you know but sometimes journeys they can cut very deep naaman was a mighty man of syria but he had a secret he was a leper and we know that you know no doubt he could you know his brother ron spencer preached that sermon to me that's one of the most powerful sermons i've ever heard neyman was a leper but he had to make a journey he had to be willing to accept the testimony of a slave girl and then go to the king of syria saying i need to go to israel because there's a prophet there that can heal me he had to be willing to basically expose his secret to go get a healing and so he made the journey you know from from damascus wherever he was down into israel and you know the leader was given to the king and the king misunderstood it and you know he thought the king of syria was trying to pick a fight with him you know trying to try to get him to do it but then you know you know the prophet sent a servant said no just just send them to me and maybe maybe when when naaman is is is traveling on this journey he he maybe begins to form in his mind what's going to happen when he reaches his destination and he has no idea in his mind that he has to humble himself that the prophet himself is not even going to talk to him but a servant's going to go out because remember he's a general he's a fancy guy he's the up and ups you know he doesn't just talk to the common people he talks to the fancy you know yeah yeah the royal you know you know the guys with the fancy clothes and the you know the big long titles and the you know those in there they'll drown if it rains kind of people you know he was he was those kind of people but then the prophet didn't even come out and speak to him i was just a servant and the servant just said go dip in the river jordan seven times he was at his destination he was at the prophet's house i don't know what he was under expectation because he believed the testimony remember he had to believe that he could be healed of this leprosy no one in history had been healed i think i might be wrong there but you know they didn't have a doctor they didn't have medicine no one could do it but this prophet because he knew the lord and so so he journeyed there and then he heard this message go dip in the river jordan seven times and he got offended that's why sometimes the journey can take a lot of you know it can really beat us down because there's a lot of things that we're going to get rid of we're going to jettison and the first thing he had to jettison was his pride i'm the general of assyria you know i'm a mighty conqueror he had to conquer himself to get what he needed when he got to his destination amen and you know he he he rode off in a huff and his servant said no oh mighty general name and live forever you know mighty great general fancy man you know what if he asked you to do something hard wouldn't you do something hard if he asked you to go to some great high mountain get a little flower this big and boil it and drink it yeah wouldn't you go and done it he asked you to do something easy why don't you just do the easy thing yeah many times it's actually the gospel is actually very easy but we're going to be willing to give ourselves to the word for for us to get what the word wants to give us amen he wants to give us eternal life that's a good thing to receive we must be born again hallelujah so so he so he listened to his servants and he dipped once twice three times still no change maybe he's getting a little bit sick of it four five six seven he comes back up again and the thing he thing he came to get he received hallelujah but same thing with us you know we've come to the word that we would become the word right this is our mirror i'll say i am not your example this is your example this is the message right i'm not your example the message is your example this is our mirror don't even try and match me whatever you do that's a that's a real bad idea that's the word line yourself up with the scripture amen but you know he had to make a journey he had to he had to be willing to be humbled and thank god he actually took correction from his servant and did what the prophet told them he got healed hallelujah some journeys have incredible hardship the apostle paul had an incredible life he didn't have an easy life he had a far easier life no doubt before he met the lord then after he met the lord amen he was he was a pharisee of the pharisees he there's no record of him being shipwrecked before he met the lord or being beaten or being chased from city to city or being hungry or put in jail there's none of that recorded of his first life but after he met the lord he really started his journey and when you start walking with the lord doesn't matter how many years you've been going the journey is harder than before you become a christian why because now you've got resistance we had no resistance when we're serving the devil because he's saying well done i'm on your side but then one day the real call from yonder came up hallelujah and then we begin to walk with the lord and the devil get gets mad at that kind of thing you shouldn't be surprised at this opposition hallelujah but greater is he that's in you that he that's in the world amen to already have the victory over that thing that we're facing amen amen the apostle paul would tell us now this let's just think about this he says he says i speak as concerning reproach as though i have been weak how be it wherever any is bold i speak foolishly i'm bold also are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a full i am more and laborers more abundant and stripes above measure and prisons more frequent and deaths deaths oft you know someone said i can't remember but you know when you know paul got into such a you know paul saw a pattern in his life he'd go to a new place he'd preach the enemy would raise up a mob and he'd be put in jail how's the missionary trip going brother paul real good i'm in the i'm in the worst cell we had a real good meeting this is how he found himself people would chase him from city to city he'd go to a new place he'd preach you know one place he would be preaching and and mighty miracles were done and the people thought that um they were jupiter and uh mercury they were the gods and they were about to sacrifice to them and he said no no we're not gods we're just like you but the lord jesus christ is alive he's the one who does these things and then the people that chased him out of the city before turn up and they somehow swing these people who think that paul and i can't remember who it was silas or whoever that they were gods they swing their opinion from them being guides to them being devils because they stone paul sometimes you think everything's going well and everyone's like praise the lord and but you know it's amazing how we don't want to end up like that i'll just i'll just leave it like that you know we don't want to just let opinion shift because what other people said but what have we seen what have we experienced in this world i've seen transforming power i've seen deliverance i've seen the holy ghost fall i've seen lives change i've seen healing i've seen deliverance i've seen people transformed i've seen the word put on flesh that's what i've seen they saw mighty miracles done but yet their opinions were changed by these other people we all know what i'm talking about eh you read that in the book of acts i just marvel at that kind of thing one day they're praising him thinking he's a god and the next day they they just stoned him and they hate the guy oh because people came along and second opinions five came out and it was red anyway so amen of the jews so we're in 11 24 of the jews five times sorry um and stripes above measure and prisons more frequent and deaths oft of the jews five times i received 40 stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once i was stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a day in the night i have been in the deep amen that okay in journeys often in perils of waters and perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen and perils by the heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false brethren he's had perils everywhere this is a journey and weariness and painfulness and watchings often and hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things which are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches so it all has trouble but then this great burden i must get this word out because remember if someone's really on the journey to glory they have a burden i can't walk this alone this is not a solo trip i want everyone to come paulus he had a great burden you know because he saw churches birth ministries be established and then his burden was lord keep them strengthen them may your word just multiply in their midst may may people become believers man you know keep them in the faith lord so he had a lot of burdens who is weak am i not weak who is offended i burn not if i must need glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities and the god and father our lord jesus christ which is blessed forevermore knoweth that i lie not he says in damascus the governor uh under uh aratus the king kept the city of of the damascus with the garrison desires to apprehend me and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands he had an incredible journey but his destination was the thing that was was was driving him it wasn't the peril it wasn't the hardship it wasn't the shipwrecks the beatings the stonings what was going on it was i have a place to go hallelujah he would he would come to the end of his road and he would begin to tell timothy he says he says but now i'm ready to be offered this is some of his last words that he repented timothy before his head was taken from his body for now i'm ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i afford a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith what incredible you know if you could put that as an epitaph on someone's tombstone what an incredible thing i afford a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith hallelujah i trust that's how you know if we could just say those words i pray that you know our names would be associated with that scripture when we think of that scripture i think of brother umph or brother james or anyone here i could name you all one by one but you know that would be our how we feel oh how we're known by henceforth there is later for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing do you love it when he appears when his presence comes among us amen you may be at home reading just praying and he just comes hardly it becomes more than a story it becomes more than just a song more than a message but you know but he appears hallelujah amen he knew he had a crown of life laid up for him he believed that there was a place for him he believed he had the ability to get there right the holy ghost was going to take him there i mean so all the trouble of life vanished compared to where he was going to go i pray that heaven is so real to us i pray it's more than a nice idea when we think of the dead in christ rising i pray it's such a reality that we're literally going to see them they may well they don't need the door they can just walk through the wall hallelujah they'll say it's on what you've been longing for it's on hallelujah amen as as he would say amen he says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to begin to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so you're saying this journey is not worthy to be compared to the destination hallelujah because the destination's awesome hallelujah hey man i trust that no no i'm just going to wind this up just just with this one scripture i pray that we can look back on our lives and we can see that the lord was with us all the time remember it's not in the good times it's in the bad times it's in the hard times you know you can see he he he never left me alone he was always there amen he would say in isaiah 43 but now thus saith the lord that created the o jacob and he that formed the o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine and we are not our own we're bought with a price the precious blood of jesus christ when they'll pass us through the waters i'll be with thee glory hey we're going to pass through some waters i'm sure you can look back on your life and say i passed through some waters what you know yeah it wasn't just a trickle of a you know down a down uh down a guttering but it was a it was a big it was a big moving body of water it was a deep place i'll be with thee and and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when they'll walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and see before thee since that was precious in my sight glory thou hast been honorable and i have loved thee therefore i will give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for i'm with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west hallelujah so i trust we can you know we can say he's always been with me and the good times he was there and the bad times he was there in the in the times where he saw there's no way out he was there hallelujah he never left us alone amen because remember he's going to carry us all the way and when we step on the other shore we'll say lord you got me here i probably i feel like i say it all the time but this to me it's just how i feel about my christian journey lord you got me here you got me here i can't boast any any any achievement any ability of my own in spite of me you got me here you know sometimes we think the devil's against us actually our own selves can be against is pretty good too you know brother brahm said the biggest enemy he had was william branham if he can just get him out of the way then god can do things william branham knows nothing about amen and that's very even more so i feel for myself i just get myself out of the way then the lord can work but you know even in spite of me we're going to make this journey we're going to make this journey hallelujah and we will look back if you know i don't know what memories we will still i have on the other side i believe we will still remember when we got saved because we will still know him he is our redeemer he redeemed us we will still know him as a savior because he's not just going to blank our minds when we're on the other side and then we have no remembrance of this because what why then would we have to go through all these things the form character and that he wants to build a relationship in our lives but you know can we just have the musicians actually we'll just sing a song but you know in spite of me he's going to get me there he promised if he promised me something he's gonna fulfill it amen so i don't know how you know i often think what is the first thing i'm gonna say hallelujah have you thought about that the first five minutes in heaven what's it gonna be like hallelujah you know maybe we won't be able to say anything just be too awesome all the all the all the brief tastes of you know because remember if you think of heaven as the great big ocean it's like we just experienced just a trickle of a stream and it's glorious even now but you know how about when we're really in the presence living in that great ocean if i can put it that way amen yeah i think maybe we'll be speechless but i think heaven will be a noisy place too and we can't get deaf well i'd say can you keep that down you're hitting my ears because you can't get you can't get paid but you know i think i'll be a bit speechless but i i say lord the journey is worth it you gripped me by your word harley just like that gripped by the star and they journey to find christ there we've been gripped by a message hallelujah and he's drawing us and carrying us through and then one day we will be there hallelujah may 2021 can it be now i say lord let's help us give us a burden for the lost hallelujah if we can just help someone take one step up the ladder glory amen let's work until until we cannot work no more amen i just want to um i want to sing a song about being up there oh yes that's that yep let's just stand and let's sing this song when my time has come amen and then we will go into prayer amen let's just let's just sing this in you know the lord is good he's so great amen i'm glad that our christian experience just gets deeper and better amen amen you put the stars in the sky and you told the morning you'll not your night until i have prepared away to the heavens redemption story hung between all the stars in the sky and this hope lay my clay on your power to save i rest my life your everlasting plan my world is
