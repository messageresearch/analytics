[4:32] Bless you saints. Welcome to the house
[4:34] of the Lord. Let's just stand this
[4:35] evening as we open in a word of prayer.
[4:40] Let's bow our heads.
[4:42] Thank you, Lord, for this this wonderful
[4:44] day you've given us, Lord. That you've
[4:46] been gracious upon us, Lord. That we can
[4:47] make it back here tonight, Lord Jesus,
[4:49] to come and hear from you once again,
[4:51] Lord Jesus, and bring up the needs of
[4:53] your people, Lord. And Lord, I just pray
[4:55] that as we've all gathered here, Lord, I
[4:58] pray that we'd be prepared, Lord Jesus.
[5:00] I trust we've come prepared, Lord, that
[5:02] you would just speak to us this evening,
[5:05] Lord Jesus. Change our hearts, Lord
[5:06] Jesus, and that and change our lives,
[5:09] Lord. Lord, I pray for those that
[5:10] couldn't make it tonight, be their
[5:11] portion, Lord. Pray you be with him
[5:13] wherever they are now, Lord. And Lord, I
[5:15] pray that if there's anything between us
[5:17] and you, Lord Jesus, that you take it
[5:18] away, Lord Jesus. And I pray we just
[5:20] have a wonderful evening tonight, Lord.
[5:22] Be with Brother Ben as he brings a
[5:23] message, Lord. And as we pray, Lord
[5:25] Jesus, may your atmosphere just come
[5:27] amongst us, Lord Jesus, and move in a
[5:29] powerful way this evening, Lord. Pray it
[5:31] in Jesus name. Amen.

[26:55] Amen. Amen.
[26:57] Life and death is in the power of the
[26:59] tongue. God wants to use your tongue.
[27:02] Amen. You say not today, Satan. get back
[27:04] in the name of Jesus Christ. I remember
[27:06] that, you know, that brother had that
[27:07] vision or dream. I don't know what what
[27:09] it was, but the devil kept getting
[27:10] bigger and bigger and he kept backing
[27:12] up. Eventually, he realized he had to
[27:14] fight. So, he picked up the Bible. He
[27:16] said, "Boo." The devil got smaller and
[27:18] got smaller and got smaller until he
[27:19] evaporated into nothing. So, you got to
[27:21] keep hitting your enemy until he
[27:23] disappears. Amen. Don't just put up with
[27:25] him. Don't just say, "Oh, you're here
[27:26] and I'm here." No. Get rid of him. Amen.
[27:28] We don't have to live with condemnation
[27:30] or guilt or shame or that's basically my
[27:33] sermon and I'm done tonight. But you
[27:34] know, you don't we don't need to live
[27:35] with any of those things. Amen. Our God
[27:38] is taking care of it all. So we can walk
[27:41] in confidence and victory tonight
[27:43] because our God is on our side. Amen. He
[27:45] is our helper, our defense, and our
[27:47] strength. Amen. He's on your side. He's
[27:49] in your corner. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:52] Thank you, brother Josh. Amen. Thank
[27:54] you, musicians. Amen. The Lord's in our
[27:56] corner tonight. Amen. Amen. As we
[27:58] boldly, as you know, as Paul would say,
[28:00] to boldly come before the throne of
[28:02] grace. Amen. And we have full right,
[28:05] amen, to do so tonight by the blood of
[28:07] Jesus Christ. It's nothing we have done.
[28:09] It's nothing we have merited. It's all
[28:11] what he has done. Amen. And I believe if
[28:14] there's ever a people that can walk in
[28:15] no condemnation, it is us tonight
[28:19] because of what he has revealed through
[28:20] the message of the hour.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's let's go on the
[28:24] scripture. Um, tonight I don't have a
[28:26] PowerPoint, so we'll do this old school,
[28:28] but I want to um I want to go into
[28:30] Romans chapter 3. Actually, let's just
[28:33] read one verse and you can have your
[28:34] seats. We're going to go to John chapter
[28:36] 15 and we're going to read uh verse 16
[28:40] and then we can just rejoice for the
[28:41] rest of our lives. I think
[28:42] &gt;&gt; that's a great scripture. You think
[28:45] about you because think about who's
[28:46] saying this what we're about to read.
[28:49] Okay? Who's saying this to you? Not
[28:52] don't put it well I trust he's a
[28:53] personal God to you tonight. So when you
[28:55] read these things you're not you don't
[28:57] have in your mind Jesus talking to the
[28:59] disciples though he was but he's talking
[29:02] to his disciples in 2025
[29:05] and he says this ye have not chosen me
[29:09] but I have chosen you. God makes the
[29:13] right choice.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. and ordained you that you should
[29:17] go and bring forth fruit and that your
[29:20] fruit should remain uh whatsoever you
[29:22] shall ask of the father in my name he
[29:25] may give it you these things I command
[29:28] you that you love one another amen let's
[29:30] bow heads in a word of prayer tonight
[29:32] amen who wants to say Lord touch my life
[29:34] Lord I want to be changed I want to be
[29:37] higher I want to be closer I want
[29:39] problems to be gone to be under my feet
[29:41] Lord I just want to be more like you I
[29:43] just want to express in liberty how I
[29:46] feel about you, Lord. Gracious father,
[29:48] you see all the hands that are raised
[29:49] across the building. We are asking, dear
[29:51] God, that you would come and touch our
[29:53] lives. Lord, I don't believe we need to
[29:55] invite you here. I believe you're
[29:56] already among us tonight. We're so
[29:58] thankful, dear God, if we could have,
[30:00] Lord, all we can give you is a
[30:03] hallelujah and a praise, your great
[30:04] name, Lord Jesus. There's no suit we
[30:07] could put on or clothes to impress you
[30:08] or even the greatest red carpet in the
[30:10] world would never do you justice, Lord
[30:12] God. But Lord, you're not looking for
[30:13] those things. You're looking for
[30:15] surrendered, open hearts. And Lord, we
[30:17] open our hearts, we surrender our lives
[30:18] into your hands, dear God, because we,
[30:21] Lord, greatly desire that when we pray
[30:22] as a people tonight, it would not us be
[30:25] humanly praying, but you would take over
[30:26] our vocal cords, take over our mouths
[30:29] and our tongues, oh Lord Jesus, and may
[30:31] you pray through us, Lord. May the Holy
[30:33] Spirit give us utterance this night for
[30:34] your glory. And dear God, as we've read
[30:36] your great eternal word, Lord, we're
[30:38] asking may you anoint it, Lord, multiply
[30:40] it, Lord, anchor it in our souls. And
[30:42] father, we especially want to remember
[30:44] those who are away, who are sick, who
[30:46] couldn't come tonight. Lord, I pray that
[30:48] sickness would cease now in the name of
[30:49] Jesus Christ. Father, may it not spread
[30:51] to any other family member. May the
[30:53] symptoms vanish, dear God, and may you
[30:55] touch them, raise them up for your
[30:56] glory. We love you, Lord. We thank you
[30:58] for the season we're living in, Lord, in
[31:00] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. You can
[31:04] have your seats tonight. So, if I could
[31:06] take a, you know, was it Gabriela asked
[31:09] me, "What's your title?" I'm like, well,
[31:10] I really don't know what a I don't know
[31:11] if I if I have a title tonight, but I
[31:13] want to talk about where there's no
[31:16] condemnation to them which are in
[31:17] Christ. That's really where I want to
[31:18] go. We're going to go to Romans chapter
[31:20] 8. But isn't it like you you think
[31:22] about, you know, Jesus speaking here in
[31:24] in in in John chapter 15, just those
[31:26] words. You got to think about who's
[31:28] speaking here. This is this is the Lord
[31:30] God Almighty more than a prophet, more
[31:33] than a rabbi, more than a religious
[31:36] leader, more than just a intellectual
[31:38] man or something. This was the God
[31:39] prophet. This is God made flesh telling
[31:42] his disciples, "You have not chosen me."
[31:44] Now, when he's speaking these words,
[31:46] Judas is already gone. Okay? He's
[31:48] already gone to do what he's doing. He's
[31:50] now, you know, when Judas leaves, he he
[31:52] he begins to speak to his other
[31:54] disciples in ways he never did when
[31:56] Judas was there. Judas is gone. He's um
[31:58] shot his last w. He's gone off to do
[32:00] what he's going to do. But then here
[32:02] here is Jesus saying, "You have not
[32:04] chosen me, but I've chosen you." And I'm
[32:07] sure we've all kind of had that moment
[32:09] in our walk where we think, "I chose the
[32:11] Lord. I made a decision." And and sure,
[32:14] you do need to make a decision. If you
[32:16] haven't made a decision, make a
[32:17] clear-cut, sold out decision. I'm
[32:20] serving you, Lord. But the one who put
[32:22] that on your heart to make that decision
[32:24] is Jesus Christ himself. And he put that
[32:27] on your heart. Amen. That's why it's so
[32:29] important when we gather maybe as a
[32:31] family or gather as a church, you know,
[32:33] we come and we have church or you have
[32:34] family altar that we should really pray
[32:36] God, God, come down to remove every
[32:39] hindering spirit and obstacle to stop
[32:42] you having free course. Because even
[32:44] brother Bram says the preaching of the
[32:46] word actually casts the devils off
[32:48] people for them to actually receive what
[32:50] they have need of from God. That's what
[32:51] the preaching of the word does. It
[32:53] pushes the enemy back. It creates an
[32:55] atmosphere, amen, that we can receive
[32:56] what we have need of. Amen. That when
[32:58] when we leave this atmosphere, the devil
[33:00] can't come back.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're washed by the water of the
[33:03] word. Amen. So, we should really have in
[33:05] our hearts, Lord, as we gather, when I
[33:07] pray, Lord, may your presence come down
[33:09] in such a way that the yoke of the enemy
[33:11] is destroyed, that the devil's pushed
[33:13] back. You may say, "Well, I don't have
[33:15] any problems, but we're all going
[33:17] through something."
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're having a jubilee,
[33:20] just have a jubilee. Amen. And let it
[33:22] may it spread. Amen. and I pray to
[33:24] everyone else. But you see, here's the
[33:26] Lord saying, you know, I have chosen you
[33:29] and ordained you that you should go and
[33:31] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[33:34] should remain. This is not temporary
[33:37] fruit. This is eternal fruit. This is
[33:39] the character of Christ revelation
[33:41] putting on flesh. Amen. And you think
[33:43] about now if God has chosen us and
[33:45] ordained us to do so, he's going to give
[33:48] us the ability to do so. I mean that's
[33:50] why it's so amazing when you think about
[33:52] the very God in heaven has made you a
[33:54] Christian. I mean the very God of heaven
[33:56] has called you has actually put it in
[33:58] your heart to respond to him to even
[34:00] hunger after him. You know that's a
[34:01] supernatural thing. Jesus would say in
[34:03] the biatitudes blessed is he that hunger
[34:05] and thirst after righteousness for they
[34:07] shall be filled. So if you're hungering
[34:09] and thirsting you're blessed. I mean
[34:11] you're a blessed person. You say I'm
[34:13] just I'm just grinding it out and I feel
[34:14] Lord you got to do something in my life
[34:16] and I have such a desperate need of you.
[34:18] If you're a blessed person to be in that
[34:20] kind of position, you say, "I just feel
[34:21] like I'm being torn in two." You're
[34:22] blessed cuz you're hungering and
[34:24] thirsting and calling out. There's
[34:26] something in you yearning for more of
[34:27] God because God wants to pour more of
[34:29] himself into you. Amen. So, you're a
[34:31] very blessed person. So, as you know, as
[34:34] as the prophet would say when Jesus hung
[34:36] on Calvary, it says that God hung him
[34:39] between heavens and earth and wrote a a
[34:41] covenant with the families of the earth
[34:43] that day. That day on Calvary. So, was
[34:45] God making a covenant with you? Many
[34:48] times we say, "Lord, I'm going to make
[34:49] you a promise and Lord, I promise I'm
[34:51] going to be faithful and Lord, I'm going
[34:53] to be true and Lord, I'm going to do my
[34:54] best." And you know, we make all these
[34:56] sincere promises and we should because
[34:59] it's our human will to say, "Lord, I
[35:00] want to serve you." Right? But you got
[35:02] to think about who's on the other side
[35:03] of the covenant. Amen. Because I'm sure
[35:06] we've come to a point in our walks where
[35:08] we realize it wasn't me holding on to
[35:10] God. He was holding on to me the entire
[35:13] time. I mean, it wasn't me that was, you
[35:15] know, with my humanity and my
[35:16] determination saying, "Lord, I'm going
[35:18] to keep walking with you when I don't
[35:20] understand what's going on. I can't see
[35:22] the way out. Lord, I don't understand."
[35:24] And I, you know, it's not us that holds
[35:26] on to him. It's him holding on to us.
[35:28] You know, Brother Ram would say is, you
[35:30] know, when his great trial came into his
[35:31] life where, you know, um, you know, he
[35:33] um he was he was influenced by his
[35:35] parents-in-law or his Hope's parents,
[35:37] you know, not to not to uh respond to
[35:39] the call and go preach to the
[35:40] Pentecostal people. And we know the
[35:42] great tragedy that befell his life when
[35:44] you know Hope died and um you know
[35:46] Sharon Rose died and all those things.
[35:48] And people would people would ask him,
[35:51] "Billy, did you hold on to your
[35:53] religion?" And he said, "No, no, no, no.
[35:55] My religion held on to me."
[35:57] &gt;&gt; And he would when when brother Brown
[35:59] would would describe the effects of the
[36:01] quickening power of the Holy Ghost. He
[36:03] would go to that time when he was in the
[36:05] hospital and and and his wife had
[36:08] already been dead and then you know you
[36:09] know he was told you know his you know
[36:11] his little baby shower and Rose was
[36:13] dying with the same disease and you know
[36:15] he would go there and he and he you know
[36:16] snuck past the doctors and nurses he got
[36:18] to where she was and she was just a
[36:20] little bitty baby and you know she was
[36:22] in so much pain her eyes were crossing
[36:23] and you know he'd be calling out to God
[36:26] don't take her don't take her life and
[36:27] he said he just saw like this black
[36:29] curtain come across him and God just
[36:31] refusing his prayer and it was in that
[36:33] moment, his lowest moment of his life is
[36:35] when the devil snuck up to him and and
[36:36] you know the devil was too smart to say
[36:38] God's not real cuz brother Brad knew he
[36:40] is real. But he'd say and you stood
[36:42] there night after night. You stand on
[36:44] street corners and witness to people
[36:46] saying God is a good God and God heals
[36:48] and God saves and God's there for you.
[36:50] And what has he done? Your wife's dead.
[36:53] Your baby's dying and you call him a
[36:55] good God. And brother Ram says, "And I
[36:57] was about to agree with him." But then
[37:00] he felt that quickening power raise up.
[37:02] And he said, "The Lord giveth and the
[37:04] Lord taketh away." Amen. When he
[37:07] described the quickening power, he went
[37:09] to that experience to say, "This is when
[37:12] it's at your darkest moments is when the
[37:15] quickening power really manifests
[37:17] itself."
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We You want to see a
[37:22] miracle? You want to see a miracle? You
[37:24] see a Christian that's been the devil's
[37:26] just been pouring everything they can
[37:28] upon that person and yet they still love
[37:30] the Lord. It's that quickening power
[37:33] holding. Amen. It's when they've been
[37:35] praying and they feel God's answer and
[37:36] everything's going sideways and yet they
[37:38] trust God. Amen. Brother Bram would tell
[37:40] the story of uh Julius Statcliffe um and
[37:43] his wife. They they were in the military
[37:45] in the US military. They were in Germany
[37:47] and they had a child and the baby passed
[37:49] away. And they believers in the well you
[37:51] could say the message back then in the
[37:53] 50s and 60s as it was in that form. And
[37:56] then what happened is they they they did
[37:58] not um allow the baby to be buried, but
[38:01] they somehow convinced the US Air Force
[38:02] of Military to to organize a a plane to
[38:06] fly Brother from America to Germany to
[38:08] pray for the baby that the baby would
[38:09] come back to life. Cuz they were
[38:11] convinced if if we just got the prophet
[38:13] here, he's going to come back to life,
[38:14] the baby. But then brother Brand went
[38:16] and um um prayed about it and the Lord
[38:18] said, "Don't go. This is my hand. I've
[38:22] allowed this." And then I don't know
[38:23] what the space of time was between that
[38:26] moment and then when they physically saw
[38:28] each other. And then so Mrs. Statscliffe
[38:30] asked brother did I not have enough
[38:32] faith? What was wrong? And and brother
[38:36] said no no you had tremendous faith
[38:38] because even when the Lord took your
[38:40] baby you loved you still loved him
[38:41] anyhow. See faith is proven when things
[38:44] go backwards not when things are
[38:47] answered.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because but because it's when
[38:50] things go backwards is when God proves
[38:52] that his faith he's put in you. And he
[38:55] proves you have not chosen me but I've
[38:58] chosen you. Amen. Cuz he when he chooses
[39:00] a people this is not a blanket call.
[39:02] This is a one-on-one come follow me.
[39:06] Like Peter, James, and John there in
[39:08] the, you know, fishing and things. Jesus
[39:10] comes their way, calls them by name.
[39:12] Come and follow me. And this message has
[39:14] done the same thing for you and I. You
[39:15] know, I'm sure you you remember that
[39:17] time where where where the Bible became
[39:20] alive, the scripture became alive, Jesus
[39:23] stepped out of history, realized he's
[39:24] more than a story. He's more than a
[39:27] testimony. He's a living God today. And
[39:29] God opened his word and caused you to
[39:31] see yourself in Bible characters. Amen.
[39:34] Whether it was David killing Goliath or
[39:36] even David on the run from Saul crying
[39:38] out to God, you somehow you read that
[39:40] and something in you identified that's
[39:42] you in this present moment.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Who's had those kind of experiences?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is cho showing you you're part
[39:50] of his scripture. You're part of his
[39:52] word. Amen. You are the you are the
[39:54] living epistle of this day. And he's
[39:57] showing you I have called you to bring
[39:59] forth much fruit. And that fruit is the
[40:03] character of Christ in flesh.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. More than miracles. You want to
[40:09] see a miracle? You see a Christian that
[40:12] loves the Lord with all of their heart.
[40:15] That's a miracle.
[40:17] Amen. Because you think about it. Adam
[40:19] and Eve fell in perfection. They
[40:22] couldn't stand. But then so God actually
[40:25] now shows the power of his choosing
[40:28] because with his choosing is a sacrifice
[40:30] to make sure they can you know he can
[40:32] gather them because remember there's a
[40:34] big gulf between us and God. He had to
[40:36] bridge the chasm. No one else could do
[40:38] it. No you it didn't matter. Brother
[40:41] Abraham couldn't do it. Moses couldn't
[40:42] do it. Elijah couldn't do it. Enoch
[40:44] couldn't do it. Adam couldn't do it.
[40:46] None of the heroes of faith could do it.
[40:48] So God himself had to come wrap himself
[40:50] in a you know as a as a man come down
[40:53] into time redeem us back to God.
[40:57] Hallelujah. Amen. And then what did he
[40:59] do that for? So because that was part of
[41:01] his choosing because he had to give a
[41:03] sacrifice that it just wouldn't be God
[41:06] above us or God with us but God Christ
[41:08] in you the hope of glory. God in you.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then so now he calls us to
[41:13] bring forth much fruit. And so what he
[41:16] does is he allows us to live in this
[41:18] time. This is a crazy time. This is a
[41:21] madness time.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; You take the arguments of today and you
[41:25] go back a 100 years ago. They would they
[41:28] would lock us all up in the asylum
[41:30] thinking, "What are these people arguing
[41:31] about?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; This is madness. Bathrooms and gender
[41:35] and they them and all this kind of stuff
[41:37] that people are fussing about these
[41:38] days. They you guys are crazy
[41:41] &gt;&gt; cuz this world has gone insane. And
[41:43] brother Ram says, "I'm going to tell you
[41:44] it's it's real close to it so you know
[41:46] before it happens." Right? God puts us
[41:49] in this time cuz he wants you to know
[41:54] that there is so much power. There's way
[41:57] more power in the blood
[41:58] &gt;&gt; than what the devil has. I mean, the
[42:00] devil's got nothing. There's more. I
[42:02] don't I think it was, you know, you
[42:03] know, there's a song that says there's
[42:05] more in the hem of his garment than the
[42:06] camp of the enemy. Amen. There's more in
[42:08] this. There's more in the tassels
[42:10] hanging off his robe than all of hell.
[42:12] That's how much power he has. Amen. And
[42:15] God wants to prove his power. And that's
[42:17] why he's allowed the world to go insane
[42:19] that he would place the people here,
[42:21] place his elect ones, and he can't lose
[42:23] one of them and place them in a crazy
[42:25] age to show that the blood still works.
[42:28] Amen. That his calling power works.
[42:31] Amen. His keeping power works. Amen. And
[42:34] what and not only does he do that, but
[42:36] he wants you to actively know there's
[42:38] nothing held against you. It's all been
[42:40] struck off. And I've been thinking this
[42:43] week a bit about, you know, the woman
[42:44] caught in adultery brought there before
[42:46] the son of man. And what does she, you
[42:48] know, you know, they start accusing and
[42:50] all these things and what does he do? He
[42:52] stoops down, begins to write in the
[42:54] sand. And I believe he was writing the
[42:56] book of life of all the Pharisees, of
[42:58] all the accusers, writing all their sins
[43:01] out. That's why from the eldest to the
[43:03] youngest their conscience gripped them
[43:05] cuz they could see they begin to write I
[43:07] know Levi
[43:09] Bar Ruben the eldest one starts right
[43:13] this is just me now this is what I think
[43:14] he did he's writing their names and
[43:17] their details and they're probably
[43:18] thinking how on earth does he know this
[43:21] and then and then they think I better
[43:22] get out of here otherwise he's going to
[43:23] write some real incriminating things you
[43:26] know brother Bram would have a there's a
[43:28] discernment line and he goes down a pew
[43:30] one to another And he says, "The next
[43:32] one's got this, and the one next to
[43:33] you's got this, the next." And he's
[43:34] saying, "Just to prove that Jesus Christ
[43:36] is here." And apparently in that sermon,
[43:38] people were getting out and running away
[43:40] because they knew it was going to come
[43:41] and hit them.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Same thing.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Same thing was happening.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; And so what was happening now is is
[43:48] their book of life was being written,
[43:50] but she was uh going to experience a a
[43:53] rewriting of her book.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because all the accusers
[43:57] left and then she's just there and he's
[43:59] there and she just asks him sorry he
[44:02] asked her a simple question woman where
[44:04] are your accusers and she says there's
[44:07] none here Lord that Lord means supreme
[44:09] one more than rabbi more than you know
[44:12] more than prophet supreme one lord he
[44:15] says neither do I condemn thee go and
[44:17] sin no more amen so she left that moment
[44:22] guiltless
[44:24] sinless
[44:25] No condemnation.
[44:27] Amen. And imagine now, imagine she's
[44:30] told that you're not condemned. The men
[44:33] around her didn't receive those same
[44:36] words. So imagine now you're her and you
[44:40] walk through the marketplace and you see
[44:42] them
[44:44] and your eyes lock
[44:46] and your mind would go back to that
[44:48] moment
[44:50] cuz now they're living with their guilt.
[44:53] She's not living with anything like
[44:55] that.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And you know what I love about that
[44:58] scene? It shows what the devil what's
[45:00] going to happen to the devil
[45:02] &gt;&gt; when everything's exposed
[45:04] &gt;&gt; on the great day of judgment. And
[45:06] there's going to be a question, how did
[45:08] this happen? And it's going to be like
[45:10] the like you know when when when God
[45:12] came down into Eden and he asked the
[45:15] serpent and you know he spoke to Adam
[45:16] and then Eve then the serpent who did
[45:18] this who told you this? What caused
[45:20] this? And then the serpent, you know,
[45:22] cuz it would have been Adam, Eve, and
[45:23] the serpent maybe. And the serpent looks
[45:25] to his left and says there's no one
[45:26] there to pass the buck to. And you know,
[45:29] it's all going to be laid upon him. And
[45:31] then and then the devil's going to come
[45:32] to the same way. Amen. Because the
[45:34] condemnation you should have received
[45:37] and the judgment you should have
[45:39] received. Jesus Christ took it that day
[45:41] on Calvary. Anything that can be held
[45:43] against you, he carried far away.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:49] Guilt gone,
[45:51] &gt;&gt; shame gone,
[45:53] &gt;&gt; sin gone, regret gone,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. All those kind of feelings and
[45:59] condemnation, all those things, he
[46:00] carried them far away.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said, I have, you have
[46:04] not chosen me, but I've chosen you.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to choose you to bring
[46:08] you to my side that when you stand by my
[46:10] side, there's nothing that can be held
[46:12] against you by the accuser.
[46:15] Hallelujah. You know, brother Bram says
[46:17] that when you confess your sins into the
[46:18] blood of Jesus Christ, it's actually
[46:20] transferred
[46:22] &gt;&gt; from you. It's got to go on someone cuz
[46:24] someone's got to answer for it. And
[46:25] where's it go? It goes on the head of
[46:27] the enemy and he's going to carry it to
[46:29] the day of judgment and he's going to
[46:31] answer for those things.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; We should not feel any condemnation.
[46:38] You say, "Well, my heart condemned me."
[46:41] God's greater than that. He knows your
[46:43] heart. You've got to come to a peace and
[46:46] I pray you have. God's taken care of it
[46:48] all. Amen.
[46:51] The Lord Jesus took care of all of that
[46:53] woman's accusers in John 8. They were
[46:56] all taken care of. They all had to
[46:57] leave.
[46:59] Our accuser,
[47:01] he's been taken care of.
[47:04] Amen. You say, "He's still running
[47:06] around. I still hear thoughts and
[47:08] memories come up and all these things."
[47:10] Don't let him put you on a hamster wheel
[47:12] of your past. update him to what
[47:15] happened. Oh, what happened after that
[47:17] devil? Oh, no. I don't want to talk
[47:18] about that. You know, it's like someone,
[47:20] this is totally a tangent, but we're
[47:22] going this way. It's like people who
[47:23] believe in evolution. They love to talk
[47:26] about cells multiplying and all these
[47:28] things, but you say, well, well, hold
[47:29] on. Rewind the story a bit further back.
[47:32] How did it come to cells? Oh, we can't
[47:34] talk about that. Yes, we can. We can
[47:36] talk about that. I've talked about it a
[47:38] lot. I did chemistry. I know what I'm
[47:40] talking about. I say it's against the
[47:41] laws of chemistry. But you just got to
[47:43] keep the take the story back far enough
[47:46] and then their lies exposed. And you do
[47:48] the opposite with with the devil. Take
[47:50] the story further enough to the point
[47:52] where God called you and found you and
[47:56] transformed you. And then you'll begin
[47:58] to realize everything before that in
[48:00] your mind is a lie because God took care
[48:03] of it that day on Calvary and he called
[48:05] you to show you that he took care of it.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can walk in liberty. That's
[48:14] why, you know, the devil tries to put
[48:15] things on our lives to try and keep us
[48:17] away from God. It's all a lie.
[48:21] The blood is more than enough, is it
[48:23] not?
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can now come boldly before
[48:26] the throne of grace with full assurance.
[48:29] Lord, you hear my prayer. You understand
[48:32] my need. Hallelujah.
[48:35] Amen. I'm not here just talking to the
[48:37] ceiling or talking to the floor. Lord,
[48:40] your blood has put me on speaking terms
[48:42] with you
[48:43] &gt;&gt; and so we can come boldly before the
[48:45] throne of grace.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Whenever you're in a I'm just going to
[48:48] close with this thought, okay? Whenever
[48:50] you're going through a hard time, think
[48:52] about who called you.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Was it a minister who called you? Was it
[48:58] a religion who called you? Some man-made
[49:01] idea called you? More than that,
[49:03] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; it was God.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. through his word
[49:08] &gt;&gt; called you and he's on the other side of
[49:10] the covenant and you know brother Bram
[49:12] would say in the Middle East there you
[49:14] know used to be in the ancient times
[49:15] when two men would make a covenant they
[49:17] would take a they'd write the covenant
[49:19] out they'd rip it in half and then what
[49:22] they'd do is when they did that and each
[49:24] one would have a half of it they would
[49:26] slay an animal between them and say if
[49:30] if either of us do not hold our side of
[49:32] the bargain let us be like this dead
[49:34] animal you know the Lord Jesus knew you
[49:36] could not live up to his word. He knew
[49:39] you could not live up to your half of
[49:41] the bargain. That's why he became the
[49:43] slain beast. Amen. That his life would
[49:45] come into you. That the covenant would
[49:47] come together. Amen. And it would be
[49:50] manifested in your life.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; That your fruit should remain.
[49:59] That eternal things would be done.
[50:01] We're not just wandering through life.
[50:04] God's doing things. He's doing it
[50:07] through you and he hasn't finished.
[50:10] Okay? He called you. You say, "Well, my
[50:12] family, my upbringing." Now, it comes to
[50:15] a point where God actually says, "No,
[50:16] no, no. Even if you were an atheist
[50:18] somewhere in the back of somewhere and
[50:20] you know Christianity whatsoever, I
[50:22] still would have found you there."
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are his child.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to realize who has made
[50:30] because as I said a while ago, we make
[50:32] promises to God. But what promises has
[50:34] God made to us? You got to focus on
[50:37] those things because he has the power to
[50:39] live out manifest those promises.
[50:44] Amen. Let's um let's have the musicians.
[50:47] I'm just going to abruptly just pull
[50:48] over and stop. Okay. But really, when
[50:52] things get hard, think about who's this
[50:54] one who called me? God did. And he
[50:56] didn't call me to lose me. You'll have
[50:59] your ups and downs. You'll have your
[51:00] hard times. But who's holding on to you?
[51:03] Amen. The Lord himself.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:12] Amen. Let Wait, let's just read one
[51:14] scripture, shall we? Can we just do
[51:15] that? I just want to read this and then
[51:17] we'll sing I want to sing that song. Um
[51:20] well, then we'll take prayer requests
[51:21] and then we'll sing He's a miracle
[51:22] working God. Okay, how about that? Let's
[51:24] go to Colossians chapter 2. This is one
[51:26] of my favorite favorite scriptures.
[51:29] [Music]
[51:36] Colossians 2
[51:38] and then we're going to go to
[51:42] let's just go from from verse
[51:46] verse 9. Okay, we're going to go down to
[51:49] we're going to uh verse verse 15 from
[51:51] verse 9. Colossians chapter 2,
[51:55] it says, "For in him dwelleth all the
[51:58] fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye
[52:00] are complete in him, which is the head
[52:02] of all principality and power, in whom
[52:05] also ye are circumcised with the
[52:06] circumcision made without hands, and
[52:09] putting off the body of the sins of the
[52:10] flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
[52:13] buried with him in baptism, wherein ye
[52:15] uh wherein also ye are risen with him,
[52:18] through the faith of the operation of
[52:19] God, who hath raised him from the dead,
[52:22] And you being dead in your sins and
[52:24] uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
[52:26] quickened together with him, having
[52:28] forgiven you all trespasses. I like that
[52:31] word. It's three letters, but it's
[52:33] amazing. all, not some, not most, all
[52:38] trespasses. Blotting out the handwriting
[52:40] of ordinances that was against us, which
[52:42] was contrary to us, and took it out of
[52:44] the way, nailing it to his cross, and
[52:47] having spoiled principalities and
[52:48] powers, he made a show of them openly,
[52:51] triumphing over them in it. Amen.
[52:55] This what he's done. So, you're going
[52:57] through a hard time, read the scripture.
[53:00] He's done it for you and I. We can walk
[53:02] in liberty. We don't have to walk in
[53:04] condemnation. We don't have to suffer
[53:06] its effects because there's now no
[53:07] condemnation in which you're in Christ.
[53:09] You walk after the spirit. Amen. So,
[53:11] let's um let's stand.
[53:15] We'll sing this. Then we'll take prayer
[53:16] requests if that's okay. Amen. He's a
[53:18] miracle working God. No matter what I
[53:21] see, no matter what I feel, no matter
[53:23] what I hear, I believe.
