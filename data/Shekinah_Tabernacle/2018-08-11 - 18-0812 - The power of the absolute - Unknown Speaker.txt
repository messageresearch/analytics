needs brother cabinas is here the service this Wednesday will be here at church and brother Isaac is going to it's going to preach so you'll have a you'll be in for a treat and we'll be back on well midnight Friday I mean god bless you also pray have a blessed week let's turn to the book of Joshua and let's go to verse 4 chapter 14 will read from verse 6 [Music] Joshua 14 and verse 6 we're gonna read down to verse 15 says here then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and Gilgal and Caleb the son of Jesse their kids Kimia Zeitz it unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and the inkaid espana 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to a spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land thereof by feet hath trodden shall be known inheritance and thy children's for ever because thou has a wholly followed the Lord my God and by and now behold the LORD hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and lo I mean and now lo I am this day for four score and five years old as yet I am as strong the stairs I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain were of the Lord spake in that day for thou hurt us in that day how the Anakin's Anakin's were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave under Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance Hebron therefore became the adherence of Caleb the son of Jephunneh in the kids in sight unto this day because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel and the name of hebron before was a courage' brother which Abra was a great man among the Anakin's and the land had rest from war I mean let's just go to the book of Matthew the Gospel of Matthew chapter 1 we're going to read just the first just a few verses from verse 18 down to verse 25 and this may seem odd scripture readings to read together but I just want to tie these together see it's here now oh no that's fine thank you God I don't I don't need it oh it says now it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the sways when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost didn't dosa fur husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things behold the angel the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins amen now let's just it's just bow our heads it would have free if you want to be remember you just well lift your hands to the Lord let's make this a personal service Lord Jesus we are so glad we can close our eyes and bow our heads and talk to you the very living true and living God the one who made humans and Earth Lord and we're so glad that you're our Redeemer you're our strength giver father you're our guide you are all in all and we just pray father as we have read some scriptures out of your out of your word I pray father you would by your Holy Spirit anchor it into every soul dear God may you have preeminence in this service I pray father may you Lord just speak to everyone Lord may the service be very personal kind of service father may we become gripped Lord by your Holy Spirit father refill us with your spirit dear God father renew our strength father encourage us in our walk with you heal the sick among us as well the bind up the brokenhearted father just lord your the supernatural God we need to come on the scene so far they want to commit ourselves into your hands and be with us now we asking Jesus Christ's name Amen I mean God bless you all you may have your seats this morning so I'd like to I'd like to speak this morning on the power of the absolute or the power of an absolute now brother Branham he he preaches a few services called called the absolute and I want to take a few thoughts from there but I want to look at Caleb and I want to look at John I want to look at Caleb I will look at Mary I will look at Paul the Apostle Paul because they had an absolute in their lives where they could rest upon theirs it was an anchor in their souls where it doesn't matter what came what went they still wholly followed God and now an absolute brother Bram says and this is a 1962 in Jeffersonville he says I was hearing a man speak or talk not long ago used the word absolute I thought that's a very fine word I hear at you so many times absolutely that's I so I looked it up in the dictionary Webster's according to Webster's it's perfect in itself and limited in its power primarily an ultimate and an ultimate is the Amen that's all an absolute it's the unlimited empower the word absolute it's perfect in itself that's all of it that settles it and I thought that's a glorious thing that's a wonderful word and now a word is a thought Express first it must be a thought and then it becomes a word because you do not you do not speak your words without thought when you when we speak in tongues we have no thought it's God giving the thoughts as God's thought using our lips we don't think or know what we're saying when we're speaking in tongues if it's inspired speaking when you interpret you do not know what you're saying you just say it that's all see that's God and prophesying you're not using your own thoughts that's God because you say things that you ordinarily wouldn't think about saying see but the word absolute is an ultimate and therefore I think that everybody should have an ultimate and every great achievement that's ever been achieved there has been an absolute behind it no matter what it is it's had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something has to first find and it first have the absolute and that's the final wind back through this back through the other till you come to that absolute or the Amen or the ultimate of what your you've got to have you've got to have something to tie to in other words it's the final tying post to every achievement that somewhere it might wind through many different things till it gets to that tie post but there is the Amen there's all of it there must be such a thing you cannot go on through life without having an absolute so you've got to have something where you say this is the bottom line this is where the buck stops this is this is where I tie my life to this is my absolute now Joshu I just want to take you through the life of I mean I mean Caleb sorry now many times we probably just read the scripture and we forget the struggles and the battles that that the believers have to go through but you know I just want to take Caleb because Caleb you know he didn't have a ministry like Joshua didn't have a ministry like Moses but he stood there with the believers all the way through there was something in him where he recognized that you know he was standing there in Egypt he was a slave like the rest of us rail he'd got the same beatings he ate the same food he probably made the same bricks you know he had the same life experience and then Moses came into into Egypt and God sent him as a mighty deliverer and now Israel was delivered he saw the plagues fall he saw the darkness he saw you know he put the blood on the door and lintel of his house like everyone else you know he heard the cry the Egyptians where their firstborn was was was being killed by the Death Angel you know he left you know after that Passover meal he journeyed with the rest of them to thee to the edge of the Red Sea you know he saw the Lord go behind them and and keep the armies of Pharaoh from coming and massacring then he saw the Red Sea open he walked through the dry ground I mean he went through the other side he saw a Pharaoh's army you know try and chase him through the Red Sea he saw the waters come over he saw them drown he danced with the rest of Israel when Miriam took the tambourine and the woman dancing they rejoiced and Moses sang in the spirit and they had a glorious time he was there he went to the waters of Marin was bitter and Moses cut down the tree and put it in the water became sweet he went to Mount Sinai he saw God come down on Mount Sinai right he saw he saw the Angel of the covenant descend upon the mountain with the word for the people amen so every one of the believers there I'd say all of Israel they experienced those same things but the difference came with their absolute what are they banking there you know what are they putting their life on right Caleb was different Caleb was sent out with the heads of the tribes to spy out the land it was him and Joshua and ten others they were the heads of the tribes you know and they they win spied the land out then they came back and then now they begin to give their report now there would have been he had overcome pressure it was here was here was men of renown they had they had they were celebrities of the of the tribes they had influence they had you know all look at these great heads of the tribes they had the celebrities of Israel and now they were giving their report and now when someone of great influence gives a report there's always pressure of the other ones now am I going to go against what they say or am I going to take am I going to speak my mind or really what I believe his the pressure comes on he was stood that pressure right because he was tied to an absolute he was tied to an ultimate he wasn't tied to conditions he wasn't tied to what he saw in the land of the enemy he wasn't tied to those things he is tied to the Word of God hallelujah he was there at Mount Sinai and when Moses came down with the Lord began to speak words to him it was more than a man speaking it was more than a prophet speaking it was more than a healing ministry or a B or Ministry of deliverance a ministry of Supernatural it was more than that to him it was God speaking through a man I mean we're anchored into his soul this is what changed it for him I mean it was more he could anchor his life on that word that was spoken by that prophet hallelujah he knew that word would take them into the Promised Land he knew that covenant angel was there to anoint them to take them into their inheritance there was an absolute hallelujah he had a meeting with God many people who had the same words he heard it didn't speak to them because the condition of the land outweighed was the promise that God gave through Moses hallelujah like it all look how big the enemy is we had grasshoppers in their sight that's not recorded they asked him at we grasshoppers that was there that was their information because the problem was they still had a slave mentality right they came out of Egypt but they weren't free of slavery and that's many times people come out of the world they're still slaves to the enemy they're still slaves to the devil amen we don't want to have a slave mentality God has not called us to be slaves slaves of a memory that's what they were there were slaves of a memory they taskmasters got drowned they weren't living in Egypt anymore they were dead where's the one that gave you those wounds he's facedown in the Red Sea how Louie's dead their enemy was dead but yet and their mind they were still captive to their past amen but caleb was not captive to us past he was captives to his future to has expected end hallelujah so he could stand there against those other against those other spies season numbers 13 now we all don't wait we're full we go there we'll follow something the Atheist follows Darwin or Dawkins or whoever it is the intellectual Giants you know people follow religious figures people follow celebrity everyone follow it something everyone says no I'm my own man I'll follow my own tech now you're influenced by something there's something in life will influence you and you'll dress a certain way because you see it somewhere you'll live a certain life because you see it somewhere I mean you'll believe a certain thing because you see it somewhere that's just shifting sands everyone is led by something what are you led by what are you led by that's why we'll ask you because if we have a real absolute that means we have met God for ourselves that is the absolute talking about where God has come down spoken to you you have had a personal meeting with the Almighty and he's come to anoint his word in your life Amen that you fulfill the promise of the H hallelujah Joshua Caleb's Caleb's life was to fill the promise of the age where God prophesied to Abraham your seed will be done in this land for hundred years but after that I'll deliver them with a mighty hand and they'll come back to this place again and caleb was there to manifest that prophecy hallelujah that's what we're called to do that's what ends when you meet the absolute Jesus Christ he said to anoint his word in your life that you live out the promise for you amen right so it's more than just an experience that experience will take you and you'll manifest the promise for your age hallelujah I'm so glad we have an absolute I'm so glad we know the absolute hallelujah God has the final say God always has the final say men can say what they want people can say what they want but then when God comes down that's different when God says this is me that's different amen Caleb was in Egypt he saw the plagues full I'm just gonna go Rebekah through this again he he saw the death angel come he saw the Red Sea part he came to Mount Sinai he heard Moses preach like the other spies did but it anchored in a soul hallelujah he had a meeting with God and that's what it has to be and we can go through all the way down through the Scriptures where God sends a prophet God sends a ministry a mentor and and the believer it's more than that person speaking to them that God takes a voice God takes some vocal chords spritzers word for something in their souls gripped by that word and the whole life has now chained to that word hallelujah amen Jesus spake a lot of words many people heard us preaching many people were gathered there's a few that caught it there's a few that caught it they were gripped hallelujah and we want to be in that category now it says in numbers 1325 and they and there we let's just read down here and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to my - Aaron into all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the wilderness of paran - Kadish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they found him and and said we came unto the land whither thou sent us and surely it Floyd with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land in the cities a walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak Leah the Amalekites dwell on the land of the south and the Hittites and the jebusites the Emirates dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan his Caleb now Caleb's tied to something he hears an absolute so you got to see this this has to be personal you want to have an absolute in your life more than going with the crowd more than going with your family more than going with society but you can stand God anchors his word in your soul come what may I'm following you Lord I'm going all the way hallelujah and Caleb still the people before Moses said let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it but the men that went up with them said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we Caleb didn't bow to their pressure because now they came a point because God used Moses to deliver them out of Egypt they didn't have to do anything I mean God plagued Egypt God open the Red Sea they don't have to do anything but now they came a point where they had to put their hand they had to pick up the word for themselves right they had to go possess the promise it was more than just them following Moses now was their time are you going to go on and take your promise are you to go take your landing you're going to take your sword kill every enemy possess your inheritance right because God said I give it to you either to go fight you've got to put your pick up the word yourself you're going to make it live the words going to come and live in you I mean it's not a it's not enough just to live through a prophet they also to come and live in your life that same God that anoint the proper to speak as to come and live in you right and they said no we can't do that you know there's a story with a man and he he's going along a high wire you know and and he's talking to someone he says do you believe I can take this wheelbarrow across absolutely you can do it and then and he talks about a few other things that you know you're on that vein then he asked the person how about you get in the wheelbarrow and then I'll take you across I'm not so sure about that because the person we're now watching say yeah sure he can do it he can do it he can take the wheelbarrow across he can do a blindfolded or whatever it was but then when the person the bystander became part of it they're like I don't know if this can be done we don't want to be like that we don't want to be like that I mean if God delivered in the beginning he delivers at the end we heard the Sunday school say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so if we fulfilled his promise in the beginning he's sure gonna fulfill it now but he wants you to get in the wheelbarrow amen he doesn't what you used to be a bystander there's no bystanders in this age you up your participator right you're part of the program Amen now see it was more this the Ministry of Moses was more than deliverance it was more than healing it was more than the brass serpent it was more than deliverance it was more than now we have a religion that we can worship God was more than those things right it was a God speaking and it was to bring him into us at his inheritance and when he heard that word I believe it changed him from a slave or even just an Israelite with a slave mentality to one whose desire was to seek God's Word manifested in his life hallelujah a slave is always in fear even a runaway slave is in fear they sled that slave mentality but when you're free from it we're no longer slaves to sin friends we're no longer slaves to unbelief we don't have to knuckle down to the devil in his lies where did they live below our privilege right numbers 14 and 24 but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will I give him will I bring into the land where where the two he went and his seed shall possess it he had a different spirit anointing him than the other spies he had an absolute he didn't worry about what the rest of Israel wanted let's go take the land what does the promises been given I want my promise and he received it now brother Bram says in the ladies in church H he says now he has cried out in this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debating it amen they should not be the believers heart should be Lord live come and live in my life take the word off the page in May it may become Felician me may the message become more than just tapes and books God's not going to rapture tapes and books and Bibles guidance get a rapture a living people filled with himself amen the Bible is going to stay here the message will stay here I'm in the books and tapes they will stay here God's not going to take them to heaven he's going to take people that are full of him where that word comes off the comes off the tape comes off the Bibles manifested and a people that's how he's taking that's why should be Lord come and live come and manifest your character come and make your abode with me Alleluia so Caleb faced opposition ready God has promised he was anchored friends he wasn't swayed by the other spies and by the conditions he didn't deny that there were giants in the land in the fence cities and all those things but he wasn't looking at that he had an absolute he had an absolute I meant that land belongs to me whatever's built there's got to go hallelujah amen he had opposition now Mary you know he's a little girl of Nazareth she's like probably any other girl but in the differences an angel comes to her where Isaiah nine and six becomes more than just a scripture that's read at the synagogue but it becomes a living reality brother Brahim says that you know he dramatizes many times just to make it but more alive he says you one day the rabbi felt inspired to read Isaiah 9 and 6 I mean in read you know a virgin shall conceive and she was sitting in the congregation that day and something gripped her your differently than it had then it had in the past hallelujah it's because she didn't know that she was part of the prophecy she was the predestinated worm she was the one that would carry Emmanuel hallelujah and she heard that word and something struck her and she went and they whoever her and Joseph we'd had talked about it later but but it moved her hallelujah and then she was going about her daily life and she was going through brother branches like a narrow kind of passageway and a man standing there about six foot tall olive complexion here down to about here saying Hail Mary and she begins to think how do you know my name and then he begins to say you're going to be found with child and the child's going to be conceived in you by the Holy Ghost and she she just has questions how's this going to happen I don't know a man how's this going to be but you heard the scripture a little while before and Agrippa and now it's going to become flesh and she just says let it be unto me according to thy word many virgins heard that prophecy for the hundreds of years after Isaiah yo was released through the prophet Isaiah many many dads no doubt said my daughter's going to be that daughter hallelujah she's going to be the one that's going to bring them a sight to the earth but Mary was the one hallelujah and I trust us the same thing with you I mean when you put on you push plane you just hear with your good morning friends good evening friend so happy to be here I'm going to you know and something just moves on you I mean it speaks to you but more than just you know other other religion other services whatever maybe God comes and speaks to you hallelujah where the promise becomes more than just a nice idea Amen but it becomes a living reality this word should grip us this word should grip us I mean brother arm says his three pulls the pull pulls you in how long it should be a drawing I mean we were drugged towards the hello Jesus hallelujah it became a no but it became a life to her she made an angel no one could talk her out of it she made an angel hallelujah and the thing is not everyone was rejoicing no one else saw the angel Joseph was troubled what do you mean he would have seen the pregnancy signs begin to you know and they would have had a conversation it wouldn't it wouldn't have been an easy conversation you can see by his response you know Joseph would I say well I'm gonna have to say so Mary what's happened well honey you know I love you I met an angel that was hard from the stomach no one else had the testimony no one else was there she only had the testimony right and he was troubled by it and then he you know no doubt he prayed he knew that Mary was a good good woman in that same angel came to him in a dream and now they both have the testimony but now I want you to know who's going to believe it who's gonna believe it imagine if there was about a 16 year old girl comes to church imagine if we're back in that day we're going to have a testimony meeting well praise the Lord I mean an angel you know you know this baby bump I actually met an angel and a lot of people would say you're right you're right you think you're that one you should be in Jerusalem or some other place what family did you come out of she's saying praise the Lord I made an angel and many would say no you probably meet some slick a devil you got to put yourself there you got to put yourself there she made an angel you know everyone wasn't rejoicing as I said he when Joseph was troubled by the whole thing and then now Jesus has a black name a dark name you're an illegitimate child history says that she was impregnated by some soldier that's what history is trying to put on the put on the birth of Jesus Christ right but there she says I made an angel hallelujah and the thing is she brought forth the Messiah amen it didn't matter what others said about it this is why you've got to have an absolute I mean it doesn't matter what other people say about it she was the fulfillment of the prophecy right she was a fulfillment of the word and that's what made it an absolute to her hallelujah amen Jesus never shook that name right she comes into the temple brother brems says about it when when when Jesus being dinner caddies wrapped up in swaddling clothes and he's all the other woman there to dedicate their babies and and he's and he says it's like there's like a gap between her and the rest of all the other woman cuz no wants to be near her because she's got a bad name to begin with hallelujah she's carrying Emmanuel no now sees it in but then but then Simeon comes in because the Lord's told her God directs his children God directs his children hallelujah Simeon comes and picks up the child Lord now I can depart in peace that I've seen thy salvation hallelujah dim blind enter the prophetess comes in she's stone blind but she can see way more than the rest of the people in that place hallelujah she's led to the Messiah amen they head it to begin with she only had the teeth but she met the angel right she met an angel of God hallelujah no she had an absolute the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul was thinking about this last night everything about him was against what God was doing in that day his whole energies was against it amen his whole energies he got writings from the high priest whatever to go to Damascus and find any of these Christians by your Banamine chains and bring them back his whole energies is we're going to destroy this thing he had learned about God he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he could quote the Old Testament pretty good I believe but he didn't have an absolute his absolute was man's teaching from gamellia that was his that's what he put his whole life on traditions this is what the school tells me this is like I passed my exams I've gave you know you know I've I've I've set my learning I've got my degrees that was his absolute that's not what God wants us to have he wants us to have a personal meeting with him right and that because when he was on the road to Damascus amen he met the God of the Old Testament I mean he met that came down a light shone about him he has a voice Christ Saul Saul why are you persecuting why persecutest thou me what was happening the god II he learnt about with a mental conception and a debate became a reality amen and we need that kind of meeting I mean we need that kind of an absolute where you meet the meet the god of the word I mean that's what this message is true to introduce the god of the word brother brand was baptizing on their high River and the pillar of fire came down and a voice it is John the Baptist forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second and I believe that this message is introduced us of Jesus Christ the word hallelujah see the world's looking from to come back with now scarred hands will meet that one will meet him physically in the air right but as spirits come upon upon the earth together people to himself hallelujah you go read the you read john 14 in my houses many mansions yeah I mean in my father's houses many mansions if we're not so I've told you I do I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you'll be also right where he is in heaven and if I go into if I go to prepare a place we all come again and receive you to myself hallelujah we're living in that scripture this word has come to receive you I mean to receive you to himself there you'll be taken away up into glory hallelujah now the Apostle Paul he met the Lord on the road to Damascus and his whole life was changed I prayed this is more than a story when you read the book of X when you read the Apostle Paul's life I pray it's more than a story I remember you can say that same God that he met I know I met the same one amen it has to be that way he says this in the absolute as well as in Houston he says now Paul here as we see here an absolute then he held to all of his life after his conversion there was a christ-centered life and what a place to have an absolute a christ-centered life it was a different life than what he had lived at one time that's a good that's a good and good indication if you've met the absolute if you meet the living word you'll see your life has been changed and he said their life I now live which was different from the one he had lived and there came a time when the Apostle Paul had this experience that brought him to this decision for Paul was a mighty man among the Jews a great theologian but he he wasn't too sure of his standing but one day on the road down to Damascus a light pillar of fire came down from heaven and Paul being a Jew was acquainted with that light pillar of fire that had been the thing that God had led his people out of Egypt they followed this pillar of fire so being a Jew he came to them quickly Lord who art thou he knew him as Lord but who art thou and the voice came back from the pillar of fire I'm Jesus and it's hard for you to kick against the pricks from that time on Paul knew that Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus of the new and he had something that he could hold to and that's how he could write this that great book of Hebrews now in your life you have to have it absolute amen you do things ordinarily you would not do especially if you have a god-centered life that God centered life makes a person do things that ordinarily they would not do very odd peculiar why as a Christian so odd and peculiar it's because they are looking to God's Word which has almost forgotten to the world today now we have churches we have organizations we have religion so much around the world and my seven times around since I was here with you at Houston I'm accumulated much knowledge on the gods and religions of this world but that isn't what I'm talking about I'm talking about an absolute connecting with Christ makes you an odd person you do odd things your thinking is altogether different than the thinking you once did amen because you have found something that you've anchored a faith in someone that created heavens on earth that has very word itself is creative and God who spoke the world into existence and there's nothing too hard for him I mean so it makes you creative yourself because you take his word and a word of the thought Express now Paul had got into that state to where that he had not a theological experience altogether but he had a personal witness he had met God and knew that that he was called of God and nobody had to tell him anything about it he was absolutely sure that God still remained God if the world could just do that if this group tonight I say this morning City he could just remember that God is still God he's just as able to answer in this case as he is in case of divine healing or anything else he's still God and if we can build our hopes not on not only our hopes but our positive thought upon what he says and we know that it is the truth and people act funny they seem just to forget about the negative side because they've found an absolute because it's the Word of God Jesus said him as an earth will pass away but my word cannot fail so if you've got the word of promise then there's no failing to it it cannot fail hallelujah the Apostle Paul had an absolute you go see his life he didn't have an easy road right shipwrecked beaten you know Imperial is robbed stoned people wanted to kill him all different kinds of things going on he says none of these things move me he's in peril of false brethren all different kinds of things but he had an absolute he met the God of the Bible hallelujah and that made him stand true and then he comes to the end of his Road you're near the end of his Road when he speed to King gripper knee and he's relating many years after the road to domestic experience and he gives the account of it he says I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision amen and he didn't have an easy rope he says I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision friends we've received a heavenly vision I mean this word is a heavenly version I mean for a for a bride to walk and step with the word I mean to become one with us with her bridegroom to walk up into glory hallelujah now this parent an absolute very absolute as Jesus Christ amen he will produce what his word promises to produce right you got to look at now the life that is manifested by believers right even even the scribes and Pharisees and the Sanhedrin when they brought the Apostles in before them and tried to say don't preach in his name anymore it says but they knew that they had been with Jesus the same life that was in Jesus wasn't them right and now try to say this is false doctrine this is wrong yo stop doing this you got off in the deep end but they knew that there was a life isn't that they could see that the life and Jesus was in them hallelujah amen the Apostles had an absolute Peter Brock buckled under pressure Jesus is in the judgment hall being being being judged Peters on the outside watching in then and it's a woman come and ask him and you one of them and you one of his disciples no I don't know what you're talking about the third time he curses trying to you know add some impact you know he denied it a lot three times like Jesus said he would he buckled under pressure and then after that after he met the absolute right here walk put the absolute for three years three and a half years however long it was but then it was more than just being associated with them you gotta go beyond being associated well I'm associated with our Lord Jesus Christ go beyond Association he's going to come and dwell in you I mean that the absolute is going to be more than just there it's got to be in here hallelujah so when the pressure came on he buckled but then on the day of Pentecost when he met that absolute I'm eating it stand and then there and then the enemy tried to put persecution on do you think it stopped them do you think it stopped the believers I mean there are threatened they were beaten they rejoiced they made fun off they rejoiced they are called bad names they rejoiced hallelujah and to make sure that they didn't make it complex and them they had prayer meeting God came down shook the place gave them boldness and they went out all the more hallelujah I think the devil's fighting against you you've got a weapon friends I mean you were to weapon you that you're tapped into hallelujah they were tied to an absolute now as I said if you tied to an absolute if there's power in that absolute Amen you will receive the benefits of that power john or jesus said in john 8 if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's a power and the absolute to make you free right it'll make you free you don't need to make yourself free it'll make you free right there's power in this message to free us from all sin all unbelief all complexes all hurts all pains all skepticism whatever more there's a power and the absolute hallelujah it shall make you free who's been made free I've been made free hallelujah amen we have a right friend's brother bear as I said these are it's in the trial the one I believe he he he preaches in temper I might be I'm over the place wrong but you're the trial Simmons how they are there's a layout this is the your the the congregation as the judge and jury and then and then the devil who's the prosecutor calls three witnesses mr. impatient mr. skeptic and mister unbeliever and they and they try and put the word on trial and then now and then but they're all proven wrong because the unbeliever doesn't believe the promise anyway the skeptic doesn't have faith anyway and then mr. impatient doesn't wait for it to manifest enough time but then but then you know brother Brown calls as the you know the you know the defense is the Holy Ghost he called calls three witnesses like Noah and Abraham and and and a different one I can't think of and then he says now now can I can I come to the stand can I be a witness and a big part of what he what what he gives evidence on was the Ohio River he says can i I want to take the stand to prove that God keeps his word and he sees where I was baptizing on the Ohio River and their light came down as John the Baptist for on the first coming of Christ so your message will forerun the second and then that then then and then II and then he's still standing and the witness boxes are worried begins to call people out we can say you there and you this and this is what they call you your nickname and listen down and down and down because God is saying now this is me amen you may have you know the world's put me on trial but I've here to give evidence that I'm present I mean that I'm here hallelujah and if God comes and backs up behind amen that ministry God saying yes that's me yes I did that yes I did this yes I did this yes I'm here to meet you hallelujah amen and he stood there you should go listen to it amen it's more than just oh but I trust this more than just words I trust as gripped you that the Lord Jesus Christ is gripped you could say I've actually have an absolute doesn't matter what my battle may come in or whatever comes in you're anchored on a solid rock hallelujah your life is built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is hallelujah amen it'll make you free now maybe I'll just close the eye mask this power in this word we are living witnesses yeah what you shall be witnesses jesus said we are witnesses I mean this message is life it produces the life of God and a people doesn't matter what anyone else doesn't with it what is it produced in you amen are we built hard enough you know I believe we're built on the absolute of the Bible right our life isn't built on man's opinion God has said no this is my scripture this is what it is this is me and it goes more than just now I learn these things but the very author of the Bible comes in to you and live hallelujah I mean we have the musicians please and you're glad is a power and absolute amen I see the question what is your absolute the Apostle Paul could always go back to the road to Damascus amen where the word went off pages and came living no how about you what's your absolute today you say well I just come here
