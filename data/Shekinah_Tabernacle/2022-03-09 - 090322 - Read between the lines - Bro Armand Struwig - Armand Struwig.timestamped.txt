[20:02] our places everyone in the comfy seats
[20:05] and
[20:06] very comfortable seats some more than
[20:08] the ones that has a church
[20:10] but see
[20:11] what happens now is we have taken our
[20:13] place the angels has taken their place
[20:16] god has taken his place and what can
[20:18] happen in this atmosphere
[20:21] it says with two or more gathered in his
[20:23] name there he is in our midst so he's
[20:26] here
[20:27] and and i know it's on zoom land and i
[20:29] know it's on the internet but you know
[20:31] what the anointing and the presence of
[20:33] god will be with you in your house i
[20:36] pray so as we enter into the word
[20:38] tonight if you pull
[20:40] and you go and try to get your blessing
[20:42] you will receive what you put in because
[20:45] the the rule is how the lord works it is
[20:48] you reap what you sow
[20:50] you absolutely reap what you sow you
[20:52] reap good you rebelled but you will reap
[20:54] what you sow
[20:56] so if you do make a mistake and some
[20:58] things happen you reap what you sow
[21:00] so tonight if you sow
[21:03] god's gonna give you some seeds tonight

[21:13] worry about a tv screen try to look past
[21:16] the tv screen and what can happen
[21:18] tonight amen
[21:21] it's um the first time i do this so
[21:24] uh it's a bit nervous because i can't
[21:26] really see all of you you're so small
[21:28] but praise the lord you are there so god
[21:30] bless you saints
[21:31] let's enter in tonight so let's all
[21:33] stand up
[21:35] and we and we start entering into the
[21:37] the word of the lord so i want to open
[21:39] just a word of prayer brother ed thank
[21:41] you so much we we're having church here
[21:43] at the milam's and i would say
[21:46] god bless
[21:48] brother ed and and
[21:50] brother matt for all the effort they do
[21:52] for us in the background
[21:54] we don't see it but it is a means i wish
[21:56] i could take my phone
[21:58] and go on to zoom and and point it that
[22:00] direction this house is just cables from
[22:03] corner to corner and screens and mics
[22:05] and i've never seen a setup like this in
[22:07] my life and they all do that to further
[22:10] the kingdom of god
[22:12] so it's not to find any fame not to find
[22:15] any favor with man they do it because
[22:17] they want us to receive god in our time
[22:20] there is not much time left
[22:22] so now more than ever let us pray in
[22:25] amen
[22:26] amen let's just open up in a word of
[22:28] prayer
[22:29] lord jesus
[22:30] we come tonight but lord
[22:33] we are everywhere
[22:35] but we came to one place
[22:37] lord and we come in one accord lord and
[22:40] we want you to just take this evening
[22:42] lord and minister to us and give us
[22:44] strength lord and help us to see things
[22:46] like you want us to see it father that
[22:49] your will be done in our lives and not
[22:50] our own will lord we ask that you would
[22:52] just lead us lord and guide us tonight
[22:54] you see many a people on this earth are
[22:57] sick
[22:58] many people are falling away lord many
[23:01] are tribulations lord rumors of war
[23:04] earthquakes and diverse places lord many
[23:06] things are going on and it's easy to
[23:08] look everywhere but lord let us look
[23:10] into your word
[23:12] let us tonight look into your word and
[23:14] draw strength and lord get encouragement
[23:16] and stay focused lord
[23:18] for lord what you want for us in our
[23:20] lives i pray that you would just take
[23:22] this time as brother ed preached
[23:25] lord and and with his song service he
[23:27] said something that touched my heart may
[23:29] i be that microphone may you be the
[23:32] voice father and may the people receive
[23:34] your voice may the hearer be so anointed
[23:36] tonight that they would read between the
[23:38] lions lord of what is being said that
[23:41] they'll go that little bit deeper lord
[23:43] and
[23:43] search for that nuggets of gold lord
[23:45] that they can take and lord that they
[23:47] can just go and meditate upon your word
[23:49] day and night and draw strength from it
[23:51] lord because your word is an unfailing
[23:53] word you are unfailing god and i pray
[23:56] tonight as we open your word lord would
[23:58] you open this word to us in the name of
[24:00] our lord jesus christ we pray
[24:02] amen amen
[24:06] so tonight we're gonna we're gonna talk
[24:08] about the subject
[24:10] read between the lines if brother matt
[24:12] could maybe put up that slideshow for me
[24:16] so um going to go to the book of genesis
[24:18] so if you'll turn to the book of genesis
[24:21] and we go to genesis 2 verse 15
[24:25] amen
[24:27] so
[24:29] the whole thought that i got and i don't
[24:31] know how the lord's gonna bring it
[24:33] together usually just does it so i pray
[24:35] that you would just follow me and if i
[24:36] do lose you
[24:38] around the corner somewhere maybe just
[24:39] raise your hand and say hallelujah
[24:41] anyways because god will just open up to
[24:43] you what i
[24:44] what my heart wants to say
[24:47] and what god has just inspired me to
[24:49] talk about so we go to the scene of the
[24:51] garden of eden
[24:53] and we're going to read this god now
[24:54] already in genesis 1
[24:56] he has he has spoken the word the spoken
[24:59] word has gone out
[25:01] so so god has said let there be light
[25:03] and and the word was spoken
[25:05] so genesis 2 is the manifestation of the
[25:08] spoken word that's actually where
[25:11] everything is being formed where god is
[25:13] actually creating
[25:15] man which is creating the plants he's
[25:17] creating the earth he's taking it out
[25:19] from the earth and here in verse 15
[25:21] after he's done all that and said and
[25:23] and the lord looked
[25:25] and the lord god took the man and he put
[25:28] him into the garden of eden so after he
[25:30] created everything to dress it and to
[25:32] keep it
[25:34] how many of us has been put into the
[25:35] gospel to dress it and to keep it
[25:39] amen
[25:40] and the lord commanded the man saying
[25:43] of every tree of the god and thou mayest
[25:45] eat freely eat
[25:47] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[25:50] evil thou shall not eat of it
[25:53] for in the day that thou they that eat
[25:56] us thereof thou shall surely die
[26:00] and the lord god said it is not good for
[26:03] a man that he should be alone
[26:05] i will make him a help meet for him
[26:08] and out of the ground the lord god
[26:10] formed every beast of the field and
[26:13] every fowl of the air and brought them
[26:16] unto adam
[26:17] to see what he would call them
[26:20] and whatsoever adam called the living
[26:23] creature that was the name thereof
[26:26] amen may the lord
[26:28] bless the reading of his word may he now
[26:30] come and just take over you all can have
[26:32] your seats
[26:33] amen god bless you saints
[26:36] so
[26:37] the reason why i said can you read
[26:39] between the lines there's three
[26:40] questions that that was in my heart that
[26:42] i as a christian wanted to answer i said
[26:45] lord just help me here first of all
[26:48] how do i read my bible
[26:51] how do i read my bible
[26:54] what is my motive for taking my word and
[26:56] reading it how do i read it do i just
[26:59] read it as it's a task or a job or do i
[27:03] read it because there's a connection and
[27:05] i want to find out more so the first
[27:06] question i heard is how do i actually
[27:08] read my bible
[27:10] the second one is how do i listen to
[27:13] this message of the hour
[27:14] what is my motive behind listening to
[27:17] this message
[27:18] why am i actually taking the time to to
[27:22] press play and to listen to what a
[27:24] prophet of god would say in this age why
[27:28] you know because what is what is
[27:30] happening that i would be attentive to
[27:33] listen to what the prophet brother
[27:34] branham wanted to tell us
[27:36] and in the third one
[27:38] is how is my relationship with god
[27:42] because all three of these things tie in
[27:44] very very closely because if i have a
[27:48] relationship with my god
[27:50] and i don't want to get to any further
[27:52] than now but i just say if i have a true
[27:54] relationship with god i want to know
[27:57] more about him
[27:59] i want to know what his will for my life
[28:01] is i want to see it in his word i want
[28:04] to see it in my life i want to express
[28:06] it through my life so what i need to do
[28:09] is is i want to have a relationship with
[28:13] our lord jesus christ yes amen not with
[28:16] rules not with
[28:18] anything else doctrines and those things
[28:19] so so we look at this i don't know i'm
[28:21] going to stand still here but i'll try
[28:22] my best
[28:24] they kind of pinned me in so i can only
[28:25] move to here and here so that's all
[28:27] right i'll give it a go so so when i
[28:29] look at verse 17 there was law there was
[28:32] a commandment that came from god
[28:35] god said but of the tree of knowledge of
[28:38] good and evil thou shalt not eat
[28:41] so yes god is a loving god god is a
[28:44] caring god god formed man god wanted to
[28:46] express himself but what he did is he
[28:48] gave a message and this message says
[28:51] don't do it
[28:55] now how do i accept that message this is
[28:57] where
[28:58] a christian
[29:00] comes to how do i accept that and how do
[29:03] i use that in my life
[29:05] so let's go further amen
[29:08] if we go to the next slide there
[29:10] so there's three things that happens in
[29:12] in a believer's life and
[29:14] and uh we've got wisdom that's the
[29:16] knowledge of good and evil and how to
[29:18] conduct yourself that's some people are
[29:20] more wise than other you know you you
[29:23] you
[29:24] you would say like i will get there now
[29:25] but i'm not going to explain it but
[29:27] wisdom is what i want to touch on today
[29:29] knowledge of good and evil revelation
[29:32] that's the experience that goes beyond
[29:34] knowledge
[29:36] that's something that knowledge no
[29:38] matter how much knowledge tells you
[29:40] about that once you've experienced it
[29:43] you know it
[29:44] it's done yes okay i'll use the exam
[29:47] example okay
[29:49] if we look at the manifestation of the
[29:51] spoken word okay oh sorry that's my
[29:54] wrong note so three ways here of dealing
[29:56] with this
[29:57] there was two trees in the garden of
[29:59] eden
[30:00] the tree of life and the tree of
[30:02] knowledge
[30:03] of good and evil two trees these two
[30:06] forces upon this earth god satan
[30:10] one is ruling the earth and one is
[30:12] ruling everything else
[30:14] so there's always two forces two choices
[30:16] yes no
[30:17] okay two places you can stand you can
[30:20] stand right in the middle
[30:22] but it's still yes and no at the end of
[30:24] the day you have to pick yes there must
[30:26] be a pick you cannot stay in the middle
[30:30] you cannot stay between two opinions
[30:32] because you'll be swayed the whole time
[30:34] so you'll never ever get somewhere in
[30:36] your life because you keep being swayed
[30:38] we cannot do that we have to stay either
[30:41] yes or no black or white there is no
[30:44] other way about it there is no gray with
[30:46] god
[30:47] there is no gray with god
[30:49] amen
[30:50] and and revelation
[30:52] is
[30:55] what i said you about revelation is
[30:57] experience so experiences if when you
[30:59] tell your baby
[31:01] please don't go or your child we can use
[31:03] that please don't touch that hot plate
[31:06] that is still just a commandment that
[31:09] still just in their head thou shall not
[31:11] touch the hot plate
[31:13] but they have no idea why they shouldn't
[31:15] touch it even if you tell them it will
[31:17] burn your fingers they have not ever
[31:20] experienced burning their fingers they
[31:22] have no idea what you're talking about
[31:24] but now one day they venture to the to
[31:27] the stove or the or the oven or wherever
[31:29] and i pray it never happens to any of
[31:31] our children and he goes and he touches
[31:33] that plate
[31:34] and instantly
[31:36] instantly he gets revelation
[31:39] instantly
[31:40] you know because the word was there the
[31:42] warning was there but he has never
[31:45] experienced
[31:46] the consequence
[31:48] so the law was there yes no law
[31:51] policeman yes god i'd keep your
[31:52] commandments all those things but it was
[31:55] the moment you cross that line or the
[31:57] moment something happens in your life in
[31:59] your and the presence of god comes down
[32:01] we don't have to just take it into the
[32:02] naked of you had experience yes
[32:05] and and nobody can reason you out of
[32:08] that experience
[32:09] you know that you know no matter how
[32:11] much wisdom they have no matter how much
[32:14] revelation they think they have if
[32:16] you've experienced it you've experienced
[32:18] it that's it yes it's settled yes and
[32:21] then predestination is the other one i
[32:23] want to touch at the end we what does
[32:26] god say about me because even with the
[32:29] world of wisdom
[32:30] and the whole world of revelation behind
[32:33] you and all the experiences upon this
[32:35] earth and in your word and everything if
[32:37] god didn't predestinate you to be a
[32:39] believer i'm telling you now you will
[32:41] not be a believer
[32:42] [Music]
[32:44] harsh words have mercy
[32:46] but what happened in cain and what
[32:48] happened with cain and abel
[32:53] it is what it is
[32:54] god gave them a choice god still poured
[32:57] his heart out towards cain he says just
[32:59] do as your brother so he was still
[33:01] helping he was still caring and still
[33:02] showing love still showing mercy but he
[33:05] knew
[33:06] he knew
[33:08] that cain could not make that choice
[33:11] that's predestination it's hard but it
[33:14] is god
[33:15] and god is sovereign and we should learn
[33:18] and know they will not learn but we
[33:20] should know that when god said it's
[33:22] white and god said it's black that is
[33:24] thus say of the lord he will not change
[33:27] his mind he knows the beginning of the
[33:29] end and as far as we get with the
[33:30] program the further we can get with god
[33:33] so i'm so way off the notes but i'm just
[33:35] letting you know once you realize that
[33:38] god knows what to do you can yield
[33:40] yourself and you can start asking for
[33:42] the will of the father because the
[33:44] father knows the true will of the
[33:45] believer
[33:46] because he's put it in you
[33:49] amen amen so if we go to the next slide
[33:52] so now we get three types of believers
[33:54] we've got the unbeliever the
[33:55] make-believer and the real believer and
[33:57] they all sit in church
[34:00] amen
[34:02] brother branham said it
[34:04] says every church service there is a
[34:05] make-believer unbeliever and real
[34:07] believer
[34:08] now i don't want to touch upon them
[34:10] but i want to say this a unbeliever can
[34:12] have the worlds of wisdom
[34:15] an unbeliever can have revelation
[34:18] he can
[34:19] but he can get to a point where he just
[34:21] says i don't take more of it
[34:24] so he can have experience with god god
[34:26] could have walked in his life but when
[34:28] it came to some little thing that he
[34:31] just doesn't agree with he just said i
[34:33] can't believe that and he walks away
[34:35] so he can have revelation but he doesn't
[34:37] have all that god give him
[34:39] and he can be predestinated to be an
[34:41] unbeliever
[34:42] and if so with the make-believer and so
[34:44] is the real believer a make-believer can
[34:47] have wisdom a make-believer can have
[34:49] revelation and a make-believe is
[34:50] predestinated to be a make-believer but
[34:53] which one are you
[34:56] because it's when the word comes your
[34:58] way and a challenge is put forth that's
[35:01] when god is displaying who you are
[35:03] because remember it's not you god put
[35:06] you here for him he made man in the
[35:09] garden of eden to fellowship with him
[35:12] he did not make man just because he
[35:14] wanted to make man he wanted to be
[35:16] worshipped he wanted to express himself
[35:18] towards um towards people that would
[35:21] love him back that will have a
[35:22] relationship with him
[35:24] i hope you follow me
[35:27] so what i'm asking is is when you look
[35:29] at predestination god already know what
[35:32] you're going to choose it's if you can
[35:34] can fight that big battle of what is the
[35:36] choice
[35:37] and say lord help me to make the right
[35:40] choice help me to to stand for the right
[35:43] thing and if revelation comes or
[35:45] anything comes your way and it's a bit
[35:46] hard that you can actually deal with it
[35:49] amen
[35:50] and the only way you can do it is you
[35:51] approach back to god
[35:53] so i'm just saying an unbeliever make
[35:55] believer in a real believer all of them
[35:58] have a form of this
[36:00] they have wisdom revelation and
[36:02] predestination
[36:04] it is it is a big thing to preach but it
[36:06] is the truth
[36:07] so if we go there to the next slide
[36:09] we're talking about wisdom first and
[36:11] wisdom basically what it sees here in
[36:13] the brown so i go into the strong's
[36:15] concordance and it gives me this little
[36:17] little um
[36:19] cut out and it says wisdom could be an
[36:21] administration with wisdom could be a
[36:23] shrewdness wisdom could be a prudence
[36:27] like in a religious affairs and wisdom
[36:30] could be ethical and religious
[36:32] so wisdom can can be something like the
[36:34] pharisees
[36:36] you know they were wise men as well
[36:38] and they knew the bible and they read it
[36:41] and they understood a lot of it and they
[36:43] had so many prophecies that was
[36:44] prophesied to them and when it came to
[36:46] fulfillment of it they all missed it
[36:49] but they knew their bibles
[36:52] they were scholars they studied and
[36:54] studied and they knew everywhere where
[36:56] to find it but the word was still just
[36:59] in their head
[37:01] it was only a mental thing it was a
[37:03] reasoning thing and you can read someone
[37:05] if god is just a mental understanding
[37:08] somebody can reason you away from god
[37:11] that's why you need experience with god
[37:13] that's why you need to push further with
[37:15] god you cannot just keep it in your top
[37:17] four inches because remember the
[37:19] greatest battle ever thought is here so
[37:22] if god is only here satan will fight you
[37:25] there and he will beat you because the
[37:27] thing is it hasn't sunk into here yes
[37:30] and once it's in your heart and it's
[37:32] anchored in your heart who you are and
[37:33] who you believe
[37:35] then your fight comes in from here
[37:37] because it says when the enemy comes in
[37:38] like a flood now see enemy comes in like
[37:40] a flood god will raise that standard
[37:44] god will come in he'll raise the
[37:46] standard because this is where we fight
[37:49] but i'm not talking about that either
[37:51] so now we look here at the next slide
[37:53] brother ed we look at wisdom
[37:57] so wisdom here is the knowledge of good
[37:59] and evil in my and remember this is not
[38:02] this is me so so i haven't gone to deep
[38:05] doctrines to go and pull this out this
[38:07] is brother armand just having fellowship
[38:09] with the lord and he shows me this so
[38:10] forgive me if i'm not 100 in line but
[38:13] the lord will will show you exactly
[38:15] where i am i do believe it amen and and
[38:18] you just you just try to follow
[38:20] so now we go here to kings and we all
[38:23] know that king solomon
[38:25] he was taking the throne after david
[38:28] and he knew it was a great kingdom that
[38:30] he was going to run
[38:32] so what he did is he prayed and he said
[38:34] lord i need wisdom
[38:37] to do this job i need wisdom to run a
[38:40] country like this i need wisdom to be
[38:42] able to run a country as you want me to
[38:45] run country
[38:46] so i cannot do it in my own ability i
[38:49] need you to help me and he prayed about
[38:51] it and god listened to him and it says
[38:53] here in verse 29 in 1 kings 4 it says
[38:57] and god gave solomon wisdom and
[38:59] understanding exceedingly much
[39:02] so he didn't just give him a little bit
[39:04] he gave him exceedingly much because if
[39:06] you ask you will receive
[39:08] and what you reap you will sow
[39:11] and god knows your heart and he knows
[39:13] the desire of yaht and he knew that
[39:15] solomon didn't just want to be a
[39:16] wisecrack but he wanted to be a minister
[39:19] he wanted to be in such a way that he
[39:20] could bring a millennium upon the earth
[39:22] he really wanted to reign for god's
[39:25] glory
[39:26] wisdom and god gave him wisdom it says
[39:29] and the largeness of heart so he
[39:31] actually gave him wisdom and he gave him
[39:33] a heart that he would be ruling not just
[39:36] with a rod of iron but had compassion
[39:38] and and when that whim two women came
[39:40] before him with the babies he could see
[39:43] and the wisdom was so great that he knew
[39:45] which one to to say give me the baby we
[39:47] cut it in half he knew who would be the
[39:48] mother so he had a heart he wasn't just
[39:51] called and said just cut the baby let's
[39:52] forget the matter he knew the real
[39:54] mother would do it so he had real wisdom
[39:58] he says
[39:59] and even as the sand that is on the
[40:01] seashore
[40:03] and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom
[40:05] of all the children of the east country
[40:08] and all the wisdom of egypt
[40:12] so he was wiser than all of them yes
[40:16] all of them
[40:18] and this is proving that wisdom is a
[40:20] gift
[40:22] and gifts and callings is without
[40:23] repentance
[40:25] so even if you know the lord or not
[40:27] there's plenty of wise people out there
[40:29] this world is full of them
[40:31] and they all can point you in 150
[40:34] million directions but none of them are
[40:36] pointing you back to god because it's
[40:38] still just man's wisdom and not god
[40:40] doing the work
[40:42] and this is where the key lies
[40:44] is what is god doing so if we look at
[40:46] solomon's life solomon lived really good
[40:49] and he reigned really good and it was a
[40:51] mighty kingdom
[40:52] and he was prosperous and he would do
[40:55] sacrifices that he did was like man
[40:57] animals they said they lost the count of
[40:59] the animals that they were sacrificing
[41:01] that's how how much it was prospering in
[41:03] his country with the wisdom he had
[41:06] but then one day
[41:08] one day he started just walking a little
[41:10] bit after something that he shouldn't be
[41:12] walking
[41:13] and all the wisdom that he had he put
[41:15] aside
[41:16] to start going after the gods of the the
[41:19] concubines and the women that he was
[41:21] wives that he was having
[41:23] because remember wisdom is still just
[41:25] not wisdom we need the life of christ
[41:29] we don't need cleverness we need god
[41:32] and i'm gonna hammer this tonight
[41:33] because you cannot reason god do into
[41:37] your heart
[41:38] you cannot reason him into your heart
[41:40] because devil will take your reasoning
[41:42] turn it and just get you away from god
[41:44] because it's still just a mental thing
[41:46] it is not an experience
[41:49] amen
[41:50] so remember wisdom is a gift
[41:53] we go to the next one brother ed
[41:56] he says
[41:57] so now we go back you to adam because i
[41:59] love the story of adam and eve i read it
[42:01] and there's much in it and we can spend
[42:04] so much time here but i just want to
[42:06] highlight something
[42:08] so wisdom
[42:09] is after he now said don't take from the
[42:11] tree of of the knowledge the tree of
[42:14] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[42:16] not eat of it for on that day they shall
[42:18] surely die okay so this was said to adam
[42:21] and adam was a wise man because he told
[42:24] eve because eve wasn't here yet
[42:26] eve wasn't taken out of man because if
[42:28] you go here to verse 19 he says and out
[42:31] of the ground the lord formed every
[42:32] beast of the field but just before it
[42:34] says and the lord god said it is not
[42:36] good for man that he should be alone so
[42:38] eve wasn't here yet god just said that
[42:40] to adam
[42:42] and adam when he met eve and and she was
[42:45] created out of him he said to her hey
[42:47] god said we shall not do it
[42:50] so that was for me not firsthand that
[42:52] was from god to adam and adam i hope you
[42:55] follow this get your spiritual caps on
[42:58] from god to adam and adam to his wife
[43:01] so from god to brother branham brother
[43:03] branham to his bride
[43:06] same instruction
[43:09] so what god said to the prophet the
[43:11] prophet opened up and said to the bride
[43:13] hey this is what god wants
[43:16] this is god's heart this is the warnings
[43:19] this is the victories this is the
[43:21] promises this is the overcoming power
[43:23] that's released to you this is the holy
[43:25] ghost this is where god is in your time
[43:27] so god speaking through adam saying to
[43:30] adam hey i don't want you to do this and
[43:32] adam relating to his wife is exactly
[43:34] what we're doing now
[43:36] amen
[43:38] but and now one thing that i want to see
[43:41] is if we go to the next slide
[43:44] because adam was a wise man he had
[43:45] wisdom he said and adam said
[43:48] after eve was created he said this is
[43:50] now bone of my bones and flesh of my
[43:52] flesh
[43:53] she shall be called woman because he
[43:55] come out of man therefore shall a man
[43:58] leave his father and his mother and
[44:00] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[44:02] shall be one flesh
[44:04] wisdom
[44:06] he knew that she came out of him so he
[44:09] knew she was a part of him
[44:11] he was wise he knew it
[44:13] amen
[44:14] i think i just got a
[44:16] tag on my
[44:17] um
[44:19] hey
[44:21] says and they were both naked
[44:24] and the man and his wife were not
[44:26] ashamed
[44:28] so look at the state year of of adam and
[44:30] eve state right now in the garden of
[44:32] eden
[44:33] so he knows right from wrong already
[44:36] because god gave him a warning he took
[44:38] that warning and he gave it to eve and
[44:40] he said please we should not eat from
[44:42] the myths three of us in the midst of
[44:43] the garden the tree of knowledge okay
[44:46] and they both were naked
[44:48] and they didn't know about it
[44:50] so also just wisdom now just a little
[44:53] bit of a uh
[44:54] i shall not do it so it's like me
[44:56] telling my boys
[44:57] don't hit the ball towards the window
[45:00] it's the same thing they know they
[45:01] shouldn't do it but they kind of don't
[45:03] know really what is going to be the big
[45:04] consequences god gives them the
[45:06] consequences for that day you shall die
[45:08] they've never seen death
[45:10] they've never seen death so how do they
[45:13] know how it is for something to die they
[45:14] don't know this word all they know is
[45:16] life
[45:18] amen so we go to the next life brother
[45:20] end
[45:22] he says and now we go to revelations of
[45:24] genesis 3 and this is where the fall
[45:26] came in
[45:27] so after god warned them their
[45:29] fellowship with god they walk in the
[45:31] garden of eden and just having a
[45:33] wonderful time with god knowing that all
[45:35] the fruit of the tree they can eat they
[45:37] can do anything they want to except this
[45:40] one thing or two things okay
[45:44] don't eat from the fruit that's in the
[45:46] middle of the garden
[45:48] he says and here comes that that devil a
[45:50] that liar that even if he he talks the
[45:53] truth he's still a liar he says
[45:55] and he speaks to eve now because he's
[45:57] trying to reason now i want to to just
[45:59] get a thought across you know that eve
[46:04] i won't say or maybe not say but i want
[46:05] to say it
[46:06] i'm going to say it
[46:08] eve was not part of the original
[46:10] creation
[46:12] god took her out of man because there
[46:14] had to come a place where the fall could
[46:16] take place because what god makes is
[46:18] perfect
[46:19] so it's the only way satan could get in
[46:21] and the plan of redemption could have
[46:23] kept off is through eve
[46:25] because she wasn't part of the original
[46:27] creation
[46:28] god has said it's finished he put man in
[46:30] the garden everything was done he rested
[46:32] on the seventh day and then after that
[46:34] he made eve because he had a purpose a
[46:37] predestinated purpose
[46:39] to do that
[46:40] so if you want to go back in the book of
[46:42] genesis and go read that again prophet
[46:45] speaks about it serpent seed go back and
[46:47] read it again it is important stuff
[46:49] because they always fight the book of
[46:51] genesis because that's where sin started
[46:53] that's where the devil has started it's
[46:54] exposing the devil and all his works
[46:57] where he started and they fight the book
[46:58] of revelation because that's where the
[47:00] devil is going to end up and if they if
[47:02] you don't believe in god here at the
[47:04] beginning and you don't believe in god
[47:05] at the end how can you believe
[47:07] everything in between
[47:08] and that's why that books get so
[47:10] attacked
[47:12] that wasn't in the notes
[47:14] so for god does know of that in that day
[47:16] they eat thereof now see
[47:18] wisdom knowledge gets reasoned away
[47:22] he says then your eyes shall be open and
[47:24] ye shall be as gods knowing good from
[47:26] evil now i want you to see that because
[47:29] eve had a desire in it there was
[47:31] something already in her to want that
[47:33] little bit of more that little bit more
[47:35] to have that extra knowledge you know
[47:37] that knowledge above that the other one
[47:39] she had something in and i'll come to it
[47:41] now that there was she was had a desire
[47:44] to have a little bit more
[47:46] not just to stay in line not just to
[47:48] listen to the word but i just wanted
[47:50] that little bit more that little bit
[47:51] more reasoning that little bit more
[47:53] wisdom because i know things
[47:56] i want to know things i want to know
[47:58] good from evil i want to experience it
[48:01] so maybe a sincere heart but look at
[48:03] this now
[48:05] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[48:07] good for food and that was pleasant unto
[48:10] the eyes and the tree
[48:12] to be desired to make one wise
[48:17] so she wanted to be clever
[48:21] she she wanted to know all the mysteries
[48:23] of god
[48:24] now if we look at a believer that's an
[48:27] honest that's a good question i want to
[48:28] know all the mysteries of god
[48:31] but but to know the mysteries and having
[48:34] the mysteries revealed is two different
[48:36] things yes
[48:38] amen
[48:39] because god wants to reveal his word to
[48:42] you he doesn't want you to figure it out
[48:44] don't worry about figuring out i'm the
[48:46] lord thy god that heals all thy diseases
[48:49] i am the lord that god that lead you
[48:51] through egypt i'm the lord that god that
[48:53] took you through the river i'm the lord
[48:55] thy god that will give you the promised
[48:57] land i am the lord doing the work don't
[48:59] you try to work rest
[49:02] relax
[49:03] read your bible enter in ask god don't
[49:07] try to figure it out because you'll make
[49:08] yourself tired and the devil is the best
[49:11] reasoner in all of the world and he will
[49:13] reason you tell you reason you right out
[49:16] of you can't reach you of your salvation
[49:18] because predestination said whose you
[49:20] are but he'll give you a very big
[49:21] headache
[49:22] okay so let's not climb on that boat
[49:25] let's not climb on that thing let's
[49:27] start with the word and we stay with god
[49:30] because it's a relationship with our god
[49:32] amen
[49:34] and then
[49:35] she took off that fruit thereof and then
[49:37] she did eat and she also gave to her
[49:40] husband with her and he did eat well now
[49:46] if we go to the next slide
[49:48] now revelation kicks in
[49:51] because now it was still just a mental
[49:54] thing that god said it was still just
[49:56] the instruction
[49:57] nothing no rubber has hit the road yet
[50:01] nothing has really came concrete in
[50:03] eve's life to know that this is maybe a
[50:06] really bad idea
[50:07] because they've not experienced death
[50:10] they've not experienced sin they were
[50:12] blameless spotless before god so they
[50:14] have no idea what was waiting for them
[50:17] to go
[50:18] beyond the word of god
[50:20] from out from the protection of the word
[50:22] of god
[50:23] which was vindicated in the day by god
[50:26] saying don't do that
[50:29] and then somebody reasoned them out of
[50:31] it
[50:32] he says and if we look at the definition
[50:34] of revelation i'll just read the last
[50:35] bit it's or it's a disclosure of truth
[50:39] instruction
[50:40] concerning things before unknown use of
[50:43] events by which things or states or
[50:46] persons you throw withdraw from view are
[50:49] made visible to all manifestation
[50:52] appearance so basically if you look at
[50:54] revelation the book of hebrews hebrews
[50:58] okay faith is revelation
[51:01] okay faith is something where god says
[51:04] the foundations of the world are formed
[51:06] that by faith you believe it i receive
[51:09] it that's just something that just
[51:10] triggers revelation to start
[51:13] completely none of my notes
[51:15] faith is what activates god to reveal
[51:17] you things because if you don't believe
[51:19] you cannot see
[51:21] it becomes with being a believer a
[51:23] believer of the gospel
[51:26] so revelation if we go to the next slide
[51:29] revelation is the experience that goes
[51:31] beyond knowledge
[51:33] so you can reason as much as you like
[51:36] satan you can reason as much as you like
[51:39] friend that says my son wasn't healed
[51:41] you can reason as much as i like that
[51:43] you still have cancer after you prayed
[51:45] for it you can reason as much as you
[51:47] like that there is no god
[51:49] you can reason as much as you like that
[51:51] this world will be okay you can reason
[51:54] that
[51:54] but there's some things in our life
[51:56] which god reveals to you
[51:58] and you have experience so when i prayed
[52:00] for liam and my wife we prayed for liam
[52:03] and he had that very bad wealth and
[52:05] stuff on his body
[52:07] and and he went to doctors and doctors
[52:08] couldn't help him
[52:10] and brother ben was talking about an
[52:12] elise that went to the doctor and the
[52:14] tongue tied got cut that was correct hey
[52:17] before they even cut her tongue
[52:20] it started bleeding and it and it and it
[52:22] just separated that's right brother ben
[52:24] amen and you preached upon that
[52:27] and we took brother ben at his word and
[52:28] we went back to our house because before
[52:30] that all we did was reasoning and all we
[52:33] did was taking pictures and stating the
[52:35] obvious but we never gave god the glory
[52:38] and we came back to the house and said
[52:39] on the confession that brother ben made
[52:42] that you can heal and our faith that we
[52:45] believe we're going to pray now for for
[52:47] liam and it will be done
[52:50] praise the lord and it was done
[52:53] and he got healed and no doctor touched
[52:55] him
[52:58] so who did that that was the event that
[53:00] no matter how many people try to reason
[53:02] for me out of it i was there it happened
[53:06] but what about all the prayer lines that
[53:08] the believers were standing in with
[53:10] brother branham praying and time and
[53:12] again is telling each one of them in the
[53:14] congregation what's wrong with them and
[53:16] they're not sitting in the message today
[53:18] they had a revelation
[53:20] they believed they received their
[53:22] healing and what then
[53:26] so yes had revelation had a experience
[53:29] but what then
[53:32] amen
[53:35] so now if we go to the next slide
[53:36] brother ed thank you
[53:38] when the woman saw that the tree was
[53:40] good for food and was pleasant to the
[53:41] eyes and the tree to desire to make one
[53:43] wise she took there off and she did eat
[53:45] and also gave to her husband with her
[53:47] and he did eat
[53:49] now watch verse 7 and the eyes of them
[53:53] both were opened and they knew
[53:57] not they thought not they guessed not
[54:00] what happened now they knew
[54:02] that they were naked
[54:05] they knew it
[54:07] and they saw fig leaves together and
[54:09] made themselves a prince
[54:12] but before that
[54:14] they didn't know they were naked
[54:16] but now revelation struck
[54:19] and now when they started seeing what
[54:22] was revealed
[54:23] them being naked automatically the words
[54:26] went back to what god said don't eat of
[54:28] this tree of the the fruit of knowledge
[54:30] in the garden and now they know that the
[54:32] next thing to follow is death
[54:35] because that's what god said
[54:38] that's what god said
[54:40] amen
[54:42] so they had the experience
[54:45] so if we go to the next slide brother ed
[54:48] he says and now we are here at the
[54:50] judgment and god comes down and he calls
[54:52] adam and he says adam adam we are thou
[54:54] because he wants to fellowship with him
[54:56] but he knows
[54:57] something went on
[54:59] because the devil can't pull anything
[55:01] over god and he gets there and the whole
[55:03] court case is up now and the serpent is
[55:06] standing there and and strange i want to
[55:08] maybe tell it to the kids if all your
[55:10] children are listening the serpent
[55:12] wasn't already lying on his belly
[55:14] he was the most subtle beast of the
[55:16] field he was a beast not a serpent so
[55:19] like the bible shows him as a little
[55:20] snake in a tree is a lie
[55:23] and it wasn't an apple
[55:25] just letting you know so the bible
[55:28] paints a preacher these children bibles
[55:30] paint a picture which is false
[55:32] he wasn't a snake was why would the
[55:34] almighty god come into the garden of
[55:36] eden and then tell a snake to go back on
[55:38] his belly when he's already been on his
[55:40] belly
[55:41] yes you know come on man
[55:44] seriously it's things like this that
[55:46] makes people confused
[55:48] and they throw them off because at the
[55:50] young age we're not teaching the right
[55:51] things and then what happens is they
[55:53] miss it
[55:55] they miss it
[55:56] he was a beast of the field the most
[55:58] subtle beast of the field and that's the
[56:00] only way he could get to eve because he
[56:02] wasn't a cow
[56:05] okay he was a beast of the field he was
[56:06] like an ape man
[56:08] looking man where's the missing link
[56:10] today
[56:11] have they found him
[56:13] they had how many thousands of years
[56:15] looking for this dude and he's still
[56:16] missing with all the technology
[56:19] because it's on his belly
[56:22] they're just not looking in the right
[56:23] places
[56:25] he says and i will put in verse 15 with
[56:28] with revelation 3 he says and i will put
[56:30] enmity between thee and the woman and
[56:33] between thy seed
[56:35] and her seed
[56:37] i'm not going to go there very tempting
[56:39] i'm not going to go there but i'll just
[56:41] see she didn't have seed women don't
[56:43] have seed
[56:45] read your bible
[56:46] between
[56:47] his seed
[56:49] and between her seed
[56:51] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[56:54] shall bruise her heel
[56:56] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[56:58] multiply thy sorrow in thy
[57:01] conception
[57:04] so the cry must fit the punishment there
[57:08] we go
[57:09] think about it we're talking here about
[57:11] apples the crime must fit the punishment
[57:14] here's the almighty righteous god
[57:16] walking into the garden of eden and he's
[57:18] busy having a court case and he gives
[57:20] her a a penalty
[57:23] of eating an apple that she'll get birth
[57:26] pains
[57:28] that we miss something here
[57:31] why didn't it give her indigestion
[57:34] you know or stomach trouble or something
[57:36] like that why was the punishment due to
[57:40] conception have you thought about it
[57:44] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth what
[57:47] children because he just spoke about
[57:49] seed
[57:50] and before there
[57:52] adam and eve didn't even know they were
[57:54] naked
[57:57] read our bibles it's not confusing it is
[57:59] so clear
[58:01] and i desire
[58:03] listen to this and thy desire shall be
[58:06] to their husband and he shall roll a
[58:08] rule over thee because he warned her
[58:10] before and she didn't listen and now god
[58:12] says listen he will and it's not the
[58:14] ruling if sisters if you please
[58:16] understand me to say thus saith armand
[58:19] you'll do everything i do it's not that
[58:21] way it's not that way it's it's a godly
[58:24] way it's meaning that we we talk to each
[58:27] other you're my help mate that's why god
[58:28] made the woman is to be adam's help mate
[58:31] okay to help him through his life
[58:33] to to make sure that whatever he
[58:35] achieves he feels love and he and he has
[58:37] someone that he can he can work with and
[58:39] like my wife she's my memory stick you
[58:41] know she's my memory bank she's my
[58:43] financial advisor my pa she's my mom
[58:47] she's my wife
[58:49] she's a lot of things to me you know and
[58:51] and now she's been stricken with this
[58:53] devil trying to attack her and give her
[58:55] this this virus and for a couple of
[58:57] weeks i have to say
[58:59] i miss her
[59:01] those sister priscillas looked after us
[59:02] so well i miss her
[59:05] because she's my wife she's my help mate
[59:08] and now she's down and and i just want
[59:11] to spend time with her but i miss her
[59:12] because who's helping me
[59:15] you know so i'm not pushing her down i'm
[59:17] lifting her up
[59:19] you know that's why we're here we're not
[59:20] here to push our woman down you know but
[59:22] we get the final say because we are god
[59:25] in our house so if the warning comes
[59:27] through the husband and he gives it to
[59:29] the wife she gives it to the children
[59:31] and all is in place
[59:33] and we all grow to get it towards god me
[59:36] and my wife closer together but if god
[59:38] is the middle pen we will get there
[59:40] okay so it's not a
[59:42] woman are wrong and you shouldn't do
[59:45] this and that just see it as god is
[59:46] saying it read between the lines
[59:49] he's just saying eve because you've done
[59:52] this your desire shall be to your
[59:54] husband and he will rule over you okay
[59:56] that's all he said let me say he'll beat
[59:58] you down you see he'll rule over you
[1:00:01] and then we drop down to verse 20 he
[1:00:03] says and adam called his wife eve
[1:00:06] because she was
[1:00:07] mother of all
[1:00:09] living
[1:00:11] wow
[1:00:12] the previous chapter she she was not
[1:00:15] even knowing she was naked and all of a
[1:00:17] sudden through all this event and
[1:00:19] through the major court case adam got
[1:00:21] revelation and said cause you are now
[1:00:24] mother of all living now
[1:00:28] not later now
[1:00:30] because she had seed within her already
[1:00:33] amen let's go to the next slide but that
[1:00:35] was also not quite in my notes but
[1:00:37] praise the lord is going good
[1:00:40] um
[1:00:43] whoo it's nice or not in here
[1:00:48] man i'm so far off my notes it's um
[1:00:50] ridiculous
[1:00:52] but you know what i'm gonna leave my
[1:00:53] notes
[1:00:55] okay so this is where i was with this i
[1:00:57] hope i've got it right because i don't
[1:00:58] want to say something before the time i
[1:01:00] kind of have a bit of a
[1:01:03] i kind of said i should finish here but
[1:01:04] let's read the slide amen
[1:01:07] the knowledge of good and evil so we
[1:01:09] know that wisdom is the knowledge of
[1:01:10] good and evil okay it helps you in your
[1:01:12] battles it gives you strength one might
[1:01:14] be wiser than me you know i know i
[1:01:16] always think brother isaac is much wiser
[1:01:18] than me you know because he always tells
[1:01:20] me what the english words means and
[1:01:23] you know he's always there for me he
[1:01:24] looks out for me so when he preaches he
[1:01:27] preaches to everyone and he gives a word
[1:01:28] like resolve and he turns at me and says
[1:01:31] just for you i'll give you the
[1:01:32] definition and i love it because he's a
[1:01:35] wise man and i and i have a deep respect
[1:01:37] for him and god uses his gift
[1:01:40] but it's still just a gift
[1:01:42] you know but if i look at isaac and i
[1:01:44] look at the life elites and i look at
[1:01:46] how he loves god and how he serves god
[1:01:48] and how god is taking him on a journey
[1:01:50] that's different
[1:01:52] that's that's brother that's brother god
[1:01:55] working there not brother isaac that's
[1:01:57] god working through his life he's a sold
[1:02:00] out man of christ
[1:02:01] so yes he is wise and he brings things
[1:02:03] to my level which is fantastic because
[1:02:05] 12 year olds don't understand the word
[1:02:07] resolve
[1:02:09] okay i don't and he doesn't want to miss
[1:02:12] anyone so he made her isaac before the
[1:02:14] foundation of the world and he put him
[1:02:16] in this church site so they can go
[1:02:17] behind the pulpit and say hey in case
[1:02:20] you missed that because you can't speak
[1:02:21] english brother isaac is going to show
[1:02:23] you my heart and that's what resolve
[1:02:25] means
[1:02:26] read between the lines
[1:02:28] he never said i was dumb he never said
[1:02:30] i'm not good enough he never said you
[1:02:32] will never get there he just said hey by
[1:02:34] the way god wants you to know what it
[1:02:36] actually means
[1:02:38] read between the lines if a pastor is
[1:02:41] preaching at you and you feel his
[1:02:42] preaching hellfire and brimstone read
[1:02:45] between the lines
[1:02:47] between the lines of the word don't just
[1:02:50] take something as what it said take it
[1:02:52] into your heart and say god reveal to me
[1:02:54] what that man is saying to me even if
[1:02:57] he's correcting me help me to understand
[1:03:00] what he's trying to tell me what are you
[1:03:02] trying to tell me
[1:03:04] read between the lines
[1:03:06] amen okay brother let's go to that next
[1:03:09] one
[1:03:10] now we go to pre-destination and i'm and
[1:03:12] i'm about to close but luckily because
[1:03:14] we on zoom we don't need to go home so i
[1:03:16] can just preach all night hey so if you
[1:03:18] fall asleep just take your camera off
[1:03:20] and i can't see okay
[1:03:22] amen i see sister case cameras off
[1:03:25] matt's all no you're still awake so
[1:03:28] just just entering man we we we're
[1:03:30] christians man this is the most exciting
[1:03:32] time it's ever been on the face of the
[1:03:34] earth you know that that brother ferdi
[1:03:37] said he says the saints is going to ask
[1:03:39] you how did you overcome
[1:03:41] i never thought about it that way but i
[1:03:43] thought wow that is a big statement
[1:03:45] but if you really look where we at
[1:03:48] man it is a miracle and only god's grace
[1:03:50] that we can overcome
[1:03:52] amen yes okay so predestination
[1:03:56] now i'm just gonna go to that the the
[1:03:58] bottom definition there it says a
[1:04:00] predetermined decided beforehand
[1:04:04] hello
[1:04:06] decided beforehand foundations of the
[1:04:08] earth back part like brother ferdi said
[1:04:11] back part of god's mind you were created
[1:04:14] then already you were in existence then
[1:04:16] already he already saw you in the
[1:04:18] seventh church age he saw you in the
[1:04:20] bride age he saw you in the rapture he
[1:04:22] saw you in glory he already foresaw it
[1:04:25] all it's just can you believe it
[1:04:28] it's all
[1:04:30] it's all can you believe it completely
[1:04:34] and it says there in the new testament
[1:04:35] so i went into the new testament
[1:04:38] and um when it goes on it says of god
[1:04:40] discerning from eternity to for ordain a
[1:04:43] point beforehand okay so we go to the
[1:04:46] next one that's a little bit small i
[1:04:47] hope it comes out nice if you can't read
[1:04:50] it i'll do my best english to read it on
[1:04:52] all my things still because this is
[1:04:53] beautiful this is ephesians 1 3 to 5 and
[1:04:57] then we drop down to verse 11
[1:04:59] blessed be the godfather of our lord
[1:05:01] jesus christ who has blessed us with all
[1:05:04] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:05:06] in christ according as ye have chosen us
[1:05:10] he have chosen us in him before the
[1:05:14] foundation of the world
[1:05:16] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:05:18] before him in love having
[1:05:21] having predestinated us to the adoption
[1:05:24] of children by jesus christ to himself
[1:05:27] so before jesus christ even went to the
[1:05:29] cross
[1:05:31] the lamb was slain before the
[1:05:32] foundations of the world he already knew
[1:05:34] he was going to die for have you ever
[1:05:36] thought about it
[1:05:37] we preach it we say the joy that was set
[1:05:40] before him is you
[1:05:42] but it was because he already knew who
[1:05:44] he's going to die for
[1:05:46] when he was walking up on the cross and
[1:05:48] his back was all bleeding and there was
[1:05:50] blood everywhere and he fell off the
[1:05:52] weakness because he was losing so much
[1:05:54] blood and he fell and then simon picked
[1:05:57] up his cross he knew it was for simon
[1:05:59] but he didn't know just for simon he
[1:06:01] knew it was for everyone with simon as
[1:06:03] well he saw me there he saw you there
[1:06:05] that's a true fact because before the
[1:06:07] foundation of the world it was done
[1:06:10] he knew he was going to do it it wasn't
[1:06:12] a hope so and maybe for hanging the
[1:06:14] cross god have mercy on him he knew it
[1:06:16] was for us he knew we were sitting
[1:06:18] tonight that's predestination
[1:06:21] he knows who believes he knows who don't
[1:06:23] believe he knows who would throw his
[1:06:25] word away he knows who would praise and
[1:06:26] worship him he knows who would love him
[1:06:28] who knows who would hate him that's god
[1:06:30] he's sovereign but it is if we can heal
[1:06:34] ourself to accept what he wants for you
[1:06:36] that's where it's at
[1:06:38] yield healed i'll get to it he says in
[1:06:41] whom we off also ordain an inheritance
[1:06:44] being predestinated according to the
[1:06:46] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:06:48] after the council of his own will so
[1:06:50] basically if we go to the next slide
[1:06:53] read between the lines
[1:06:55] read between the lines so brother
[1:06:56] brandon put this quote up and i love it
[1:06:58] i read it and this is where the sermon
[1:07:00] came from
[1:07:01] he says who shall separate us from the
[1:07:04] love of christ
[1:07:05] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:07:07] persecution or feminine or nakedness or
[1:07:10] peril or sword
[1:07:11] or world war iii
[1:07:13] or
[1:07:14] or not having food on your table or not
[1:07:17] having money in your bank account or
[1:07:19] what would separate you from god loving
[1:07:22] you
[1:07:24] tell me what would separate you from his
[1:07:26] love
[1:07:27] for us
[1:07:30] as it is written for thy sake
[1:07:32] we are all
[1:07:33] killed we are killed all the day long
[1:07:36] and we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:07:38] slaughter nay in all things we are more
[1:07:42] than conquerors
[1:07:44] through him that loved us
[1:07:47] so predestination
[1:07:49] isn't not just a set of rules that god
[1:07:51] set out and say you know what you are
[1:07:53] predestinated so you'll make it and abc
[1:07:57] and you know when you do programming on
[1:07:58] a computer you've got zeros and ones and
[1:08:00] zeros and ones and zeros and once and
[1:08:02] these are months and he's pre-destinated
[1:08:04] he's not he loved us
[1:08:07] he loved us
[1:08:08] and when he placed us on this earth he
[1:08:10] knew where we would be
[1:08:12] and he knew that that purpose for our
[1:08:14] life is there for a reason and because
[1:08:16] he loved us he placed us at a time where
[1:08:18] he could trust us with this word he
[1:08:21] placed us at a time where he could put
[1:08:23] confidence in us like he did with job
[1:08:26] you know this is not just new testament
[1:08:27] if you look back at job's life
[1:08:29] satan came before god
[1:08:32] and said yeah you've got to hedge over
[1:08:33] him and you protect him that's the way
[1:08:35] he loves you he's the richest man in the
[1:08:37] in the in the world basically he's got
[1:08:39] prosperity he's got sons and daughters
[1:08:42] and so many cattle he can't basically
[1:08:44] cow them account them but if you take
[1:08:46] them all away
[1:08:47] he'll curse you to your face
[1:08:51] so that's all testament that's not that
[1:08:53] definition that said just new testament
[1:08:55] this is not a new thing this has come
[1:08:57] from the old testament already this
[1:08:58] comes from the first book in the bible
[1:09:00] job the oldest book i know of
[1:09:03] where god knew that job will not turn
[1:09:07] no matter what satan threw at him he
[1:09:09] says that's a righteous man
[1:09:12] and he loves me and he will stay in his
[1:09:14] way
[1:09:15] maybe he didn't say he loves me but i
[1:09:16] know he loved him because when
[1:09:18] everything happens now look at job's
[1:09:20] life here comes the first messenger in
[1:09:22] job's life
[1:09:23] and he stands by by job and he says we
[1:09:25] were out in the field and the cattle
[1:09:27] were eating and all that stuff and there
[1:09:29] there i can't remember who attacked us
[1:09:31] and i think it was the
[1:09:33] ooh
[1:09:34] who was it
[1:09:35] um it was the sirians or something like
[1:09:37] that attacked the men killed them all
[1:09:40] stole the cattle and took them away and
[1:09:42] i lived and here i am and then the next
[1:09:44] messenger runs to him and he goes oh we
[1:09:46] were in the field and
[1:09:47] and the fire of god ran down and all the
[1:09:50] the the harvest is burned up and
[1:09:51] everything is destroyed i'm the only one
[1:09:53] to live here i am and here comes the
[1:09:55] third one he says and your children was
[1:09:57] in the oldest house and they were all
[1:09:59] having fellowship and having nice food
[1:10:01] and they came in and killed them all and
[1:10:02] i survived and here i am and
[1:10:05] you see everything happened around job
[1:10:07] and in a very instant in his life
[1:10:10] everything failed
[1:10:12] everything went wrong
[1:10:15] he never reasoned it
[1:10:17] he didn't get angry with god
[1:10:19] he turned around and he put it except
[1:10:21] cloth and ashes are very many and he
[1:10:23] went down and he says god giveth and god
[1:10:25] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[1:10:27] lord because he knew that there was a
[1:10:29] purpose that was happening he couldn't
[1:10:30] see it and no fear was one of the things
[1:10:32] that triggered it he knew there was a
[1:10:34] purpose
[1:10:35] so yes he might not have the revelation
[1:10:37] right there but he knew he was a
[1:10:39] believer he knew was predestinated not
[1:10:42] to talk against god because he loved god
[1:10:44] and he did everything that god commanded
[1:10:46] him and he knew he had no sin in his
[1:10:48] life so he knew when he was standing
[1:10:49] there he was a righteous man before god
[1:10:52] no matter what happened to him
[1:10:54] no matter what his friends came to tell
[1:10:56] him he knew where he was standing it
[1:10:59] wasn't pleasant if you read the book of
[1:11:01] job it was a horrible experience and i i
[1:11:04] i never wish it upon anyone
[1:11:06] but he knew where he was standing he
[1:11:09] knew he was a believer because he was
[1:11:10] predestinated to go through that trial
[1:11:15] and if we go to the next one
[1:11:17] it's and now
[1:11:19] oh no sorry verse 38 if we can go back
[1:11:21] and he says for i am persuaded that
[1:11:24] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:11:27] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:11:29] present nor things to come nor height
[1:11:32] nor depth nor any creature shall be able
[1:11:35] to separate us from the love of god
[1:11:37] which is in christ our lord and if you
[1:11:40] remember this kid
[1:11:42] nothing can separate you from the love
[1:11:44] of god and predestination
[1:11:47] is the love of god
[1:11:49] for you
[1:11:50] don't worry about anybody else that's
[1:11:52] not your job god is sovereign he's in
[1:11:55] control you are predestinated to have
[1:11:58] heard this message you are predestinated
[1:12:00] to be walking upon this earth now you
[1:12:02] not matter what goes on around you there
[1:12:04] is a purpose why you are here and god is
[1:12:07] doing it because he loves you
[1:12:09] as hard as it might be
[1:12:12] he loves you because he's got something
[1:12:14] more for you in your life don't miss it
[1:12:16] do not miss it whatever you do
[1:12:19] now brother branham says you know i'll
[1:12:21] admit that the people's people study too
[1:12:24] much they try to go too far ahead they
[1:12:26] try to think too hard and sometimes have
[1:12:29] mental breakdowns and things on the
[1:12:32] account of studying about the lord
[1:12:35] he wasn't talking maths here
[1:12:37] well you can have a mental breakdown
[1:12:39] trying to understand mass i know you
[1:12:41] know
[1:12:45] maths is terrible i mean it's a
[1:12:47] wonderful thing if you know the rules
[1:12:48] and the laws and all the places but it's
[1:12:50] when to apply them with that's the trick
[1:12:51] theory mate
[1:12:53] yeah so if you missed that q when they
[1:12:55] was giving the lesson
[1:12:56] you're not going to get it okay
[1:12:59] go stand in the back of the line again
[1:13:01] he says but
[1:13:02] because they're trying to understand god
[1:13:04] so much they think the more they know
[1:13:08] the greater their relationship with god
[1:13:10] is the more they know the more they know
[1:13:13] about god that's a lie
[1:13:16] i'm not saying don't read your bible
[1:13:19] you'll see now in a minute
[1:13:20] but it's the knowledge it's the it's the
[1:13:23] chasing of knowing and trying to
[1:13:25] figuring it out that's when you cannot
[1:13:28] get closer to god because it's still you
[1:13:30] doing the work and not the father in
[1:13:32] heaven which is doing the work through
[1:13:34] you
[1:13:34] don't miss that don't try to chase after
[1:13:37] god in some mental
[1:13:39] capability seek him in your life seek
[1:13:42] him in his word
[1:13:43] he says the only thing you have to do is
[1:13:46] to fall in love with him
[1:13:49] just fall in love with him
[1:13:51] and just go on right on loving him amen
[1:13:54] it is not trying to push him into
[1:13:56] something or to make yourself something
[1:13:59] you're not just go ahead and let god use
[1:14:02] you the way he wants to use you
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:07] just yield yourself commit yourself and
[1:14:10] walk on happy singing rejoicing that's
[1:14:13] the way
[1:14:15] not studying
[1:14:16] that's the way a relationship with god
[1:14:20] he says when i'm out in the missions
[1:14:22] my wife writes me a letter
[1:14:24] and i love her
[1:14:26] and she loves me and she says dear bill
[1:14:30] tonight i said i'll put the children to
[1:14:32] bed and i've worked today and i see what
[1:14:35] she's writing
[1:14:36] but see
[1:14:37] i so love her that i can read between
[1:14:41] the lines
[1:14:43] because i can read between the lines
[1:14:45] that's the way how it is with god
[1:14:49] oh no sorry i know what she's talking
[1:14:51] about she don't have to tell me i know
[1:14:54] because i can read between the lines
[1:14:56] that's the way it is with god we are not
[1:14:59] trying to study for some news newspaper
[1:15:02] standpoint or some theological
[1:15:04] standpoint oh i got that word i praise
[1:15:06] the lord but fall in love with him get
[1:15:10] down and really get him in your heart
[1:15:13] and love god the love of god is shed
[1:15:16] abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost
[1:15:18] then go reading your bible
[1:15:21] love him then read your bible
[1:15:24] you will see
[1:15:25] it will come right out between the lines
[1:15:28] amen because you love him it doesn't
[1:15:31] matter what he says in the bible you
[1:15:33] know sweet in your mouth put her in your
[1:15:35] belly however the word comes we take it
[1:15:38] lord you know however it comes across
[1:15:40] what i need to fix what i need to change
[1:15:43] it's all right lord i understand i love
[1:15:45] you i will do it because now it's a
[1:15:48] relationship and not just a doctrine or
[1:15:50] instruction like in the garden of eden
[1:15:53] but you can read between the lines and
[1:15:55] see the heart of god
[1:15:58] in your life
[1:16:02] jesus thanked the father because he hid
[1:16:04] it from those things of the eyes of the
[1:16:06] wise and prudent
[1:16:07] now
[1:16:08] no one else could read your wife's
[1:16:11] letters like that
[1:16:12] because i love her that way see
[1:16:15] and that is the way she writes to me
[1:16:17] that's the way god writes to you
[1:16:20] it's between the lines
[1:16:22] you read it
[1:16:24] amen and with that
[1:16:26] let us close tonight in a word of prayer
[1:16:29] and uh
[1:16:30] if if this world has gotten a little bit
[1:16:33] fuzzy
[1:16:34] you know and you're trying to work
[1:16:36] yourself up into some religious place or
[1:16:38] some place where you feel worthy
[1:16:40] to to serve the lord forget about those
[1:16:43] things
[1:16:44] because you're now miserable forget
[1:16:45] about those things
[1:16:47] why don't you just go back and fall in
[1:16:49] love with jesus christ
[1:16:51] why don't you just start there
[1:16:54] you know i would never in my life have
[1:16:56] seen myself
[1:16:57] on a wednesday night standing in some
[1:16:59] house
[1:17:02] at a at a pulpit which was makeshift
[1:17:04] with a microphone and some people on
[1:17:06] zoom and sharing the word of god
[1:17:08] why do i do that
[1:17:11] why
[1:17:12] not me
[1:17:13] because i love him
[1:17:15] don't lose your love for god because if
[1:17:18] you love god and correction comes you
[1:17:21] can take it
[1:17:22] if you love god and is asking you
[1:17:24] something that you should surrender you
[1:17:26] can do it
[1:17:28] if you love god and is asking you to
[1:17:30] love him more he'll give you the love to
[1:17:32] love him more he can do it
[1:17:34] but just love god
[1:17:37] so let's go one step back and let's
[1:17:39] start loving god again amen
[1:17:42] so let us all just pray together tonight
[1:17:44] and then i'll hand over the service to
[1:17:45] brother ben again oh brother um ed again
[1:17:48] our gracious heavenly father
[1:17:50] we love you lord
[1:17:52] and lord all these words might be mixed
[1:17:54] up lord and it doesn't really make sense
[1:17:56] sometimes lord and in my head maybe a
[1:17:58] lot of things make sense and then
[1:18:00] lord it's not me saying anything tonight
[1:18:03] it's you
[1:18:04] lord and when i got this thought i know
[1:18:06] lord you were trying to tell us one
[1:18:08] thing
[1:18:09] just
[1:18:10] relax there's so many things going on
[1:18:13] these wisdoms and revelations and
[1:18:15] predestination and all these terms that
[1:18:17] gets thrown around so loosely sometimes
[1:18:20] lord and and and all these doctrines
[1:18:22] that comes out and all these
[1:18:23] commandments and everything that we hear
[1:18:25] even on the tapes father and sometimes
[1:18:27] it strikes our heart
[1:18:29] and lord because we don't understand it
[1:18:31] lord we ask that you will just help us
[1:18:33] lord because if we love you we would ask
[1:18:36] you why
[1:18:37] if we love you lord we will go back into
[1:18:39] our word and go search the truth and
[1:18:41] just go keep on reading and say lord
[1:18:43] show us between those lines lord and if
[1:18:46] we got to a place where actually we're
[1:18:48] not in our word lord and we're not
[1:18:50] walking with you and we're not as in
[1:18:52] love with you as we was when we started
[1:18:54] lord i said you would forgive us father
[1:18:56] lord and like the heart of david you
[1:18:58] said man he was a man of after your own
[1:19:00] heart because lord he was quick to
[1:19:03] repent and he knew lord when you spoke
[1:19:04] to him that he would change his ways
[1:19:06] even he was so completely wrong
[1:19:09] lord and the prophet told him he was
[1:19:11] wrong he knew lord that if he would come
[1:19:13] before you might reap what he sowed
[1:19:15] but he knew lord that you would forgive
[1:19:17] him
[1:19:18] because he knew that he loved you lord
[1:19:20] and no matter what happened after that
[1:19:22] his love for you was sacred lord and it
[1:19:25] was something that was dear to him lord
[1:19:27] and yes it happened and and a lot of
[1:19:29] things happened in his life
[1:19:31] because of of that lord but i know that
[1:19:33] you still loved him father and he never
[1:19:36] never turned back on you and said why or
[1:19:38] why not lord instead he just kept
[1:19:40] fighting for you lord and keep standing
[1:19:42] for you regardless of all the things
[1:19:44] because he knew that there was a purpose
[1:19:46] father as we go tonight and we do we go
[1:19:49] in the rest of this week lord we ask
[1:19:51] that you will increase our love for you
[1:19:52] lord that when we open our word it's not
[1:19:54] a chore lord we open our word we can go
[1:19:57] and lord what do you want from me today
[1:19:59] lord if we put on a message it's not a
[1:20:01] bunch of rules or dogmas or creeds or
[1:20:04] some man that's got a mission lord but
[1:20:06] that we will read that voice behind the
[1:20:07] voice lord when we read our bible it
[1:20:10] wouldn't just be death and hell and
[1:20:11] broom and fire and brimstone falling and
[1:20:14] judgment and law and all those things
[1:20:16] but we'll see love
[1:20:17] unconditional love
[1:20:19] we'll see the plan of redemption we'll
[1:20:21] see a healer we'll see the mighty
[1:20:23] conquerors stepping forth claiming us
[1:20:25] back lord when we were once lost lord
[1:20:27] and and struck him down in sin lord
[1:20:29] taking us out of that mighty reclaim the
[1:20:31] god that came and and called us lord
[1:20:34] because you were calling for us we never
[1:20:36] chose you lord you chose us
[1:20:39] but we say thank you that you did and
[1:20:41] lord no matter how many others my fault
[1:20:43] lord i'm predestinated to believe i am
[1:20:46] for ordained to be a believer and to be
[1:20:48] sold out lord and to be standing here
[1:20:50] and just saying lord how good you are to
[1:20:52] me even if all fails
[1:20:55] even if everything goes wrong even if
[1:20:58] it's just so bad lord and we don't
[1:21:00] understand why that we can still stand
[1:21:02] as job and say lord
[1:21:04] god you are almighty
[1:21:06] you are sovereign lord and you know what
[1:21:08] before even time i was shouting with the
[1:21:11] sons of god lord and rejoicing when the
[1:21:14] lamb took the throne lord jesus may i
[1:21:16] remember that day when i was there lord
[1:21:18] because i believe just as in the book of
[1:21:20] revelation lord when there was silence
[1:21:22] in heaven we were there lord when you
[1:21:25] went to the cross we were there when
[1:21:27] miracles happened and you were walking
[1:21:29] here we were there lord we were all part
[1:21:31] of it we just maybe have a bit of
[1:21:33] amnesia lord but we were there because
[1:21:35] we are believers
[1:21:37] lord the only reason you make us see now
[1:21:40] is because you love us and lord
[1:21:43] i rebuke the enemy lord
[1:21:45] i rebuke him in the name of jesus christ
[1:21:48] and i say satan get back in your
[1:21:49] position under our feet
[1:21:51] lord you've wrapped up that plan of
[1:21:53] redemption you've taken back the book
[1:21:56] that adam lost
[1:21:57] lord that that chair of them stayed just
