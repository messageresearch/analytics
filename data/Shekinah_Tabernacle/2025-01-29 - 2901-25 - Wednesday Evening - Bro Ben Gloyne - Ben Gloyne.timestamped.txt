[11:30] amen you can all have your seats this
[11:33] evening we have a quick testimony from
[11:36] brother and then a special from the
[11:39] glowing girls
[12:15] God bless
[12:17] you one two yeah God bless you richly I
[12:22] greet you all in the name of our Lord
[12:23] Jesus Christ mine it won't be long but I
[12:27] feel it's significant to me and I
[12:30] thought I could share it with you um
[12:33] just to encourage you we went to support
[12:37] over that side to brother Tess so on our
[12:40] way back there was a lot of cars on the
[12:44] road that came or are going to the race
[12:47] you know with these race cars pulling
[12:49] pulling a little a race car at the back
[12:52] those ones so there was a lot of them on
[12:54] the road now we filled up and then left
[13:00] the road before ohaki is very windy very
[13:03] windy and I gave kir to drive while it's
[13:05] still light and I'm going to
[13:07] drive H when it gets dark so it was
[13:10] going very well and then
[13:12] strangely many of us will be sleeping
[13:15] when another one is driving so we were
[13:17] almost all awake so we saw this an
[13:20] almost an accident that that almost
[13:22] happened so as we just went around the
[13:26] band actually before the band
[13:30] I I said to K hey we were talking about
[13:32] you know these yellow boards that that
[13:34] directs you how how the road bends how
[13:37] sharp it is and they give you the
[13:38] estimate speed you see these ones
[13:41] they'll say 75 85 or 80 whatever so I
[13:44] was we were just chatting about that and
[13:46] I say you see these boats you must use
[13:48] them when you see it that's the average
[13:50] speed you can navigate that cave so he
[13:54] was not
[13:55] speeding just to clear to clear the
[13:58] boy so as soon as we we we get onto that
[14:01] band that sharp band man it was just a
[14:05] two lane one way I was I mean two lanes
[14:08] that way that way then a car BMW pulling
[14:12] one of those race cars came directly in
[14:14] our
[14:17] lane and it was coming for us and it he
[14:20] was overtaking a truck and he's he is
[14:24] pulling a trailer with that car so it
[14:29] was so
[14:30] fast that I knew that if the angel of
[14:33] the Lord was not in the
[14:35] car right now you could be singing himym
[14:38] songs while we are jumping in
[14:40] heaven right now because that's what
[14:43] almost
[14:44] happened he almost wanted to destroy my
[14:47] whole family and that car was was not
[14:49] going
[14:50] slow only us were going slow because
[14:54] we've just finished talking about
[14:55] navigating the road and you know that
[14:57] bend at a certain speed and this car
[15:01] just
[15:01] come he was trying to push to pass that
[15:05] truck and come in and he he just
[15:08] couldn't do it by the grace of God the
[15:11] road had a little bit of a a
[15:14] shoulder kirat said he told us that I
[15:16] didn't plan I I didn't know what to do
[15:19] we were all just shocked I didn't even
[15:22] have time to tell him hey just go this
[15:24] way I did not have nobody had time to
[15:26] react we were just shocked and it was
[15:29] so I believe it was the angel of the
[15:31] Lord who moved the car to the left
[15:34] because he gave that Sky a space of a
[15:36] meter or less just to pass us and then
[15:39] he was gone and and we we were only
[15:41] reacting saying what is happening or why
[15:44] is he doing this after so that's how
[15:46] fast it was when he came so I just
[15:49] wanted to tell you to encourage you that
[15:52] you know never forget to pray when you
[15:56] travel that's very very important
[15:58] because because the angel of the Lord is
[16:00] with you if you
[16:01] forget ask the Lord beforehand to remind
[16:05] you he will remind you so never never
[16:09] never forget to pray when you are on the
[16:10] road even if you already left and the
[16:12] Lord reminds you do it while you're
[16:15] driving be reverent and ask the Lord to
[16:17] be with you in the car because the enemy
[16:20] is on a rampage or people of God are he
[16:24] wants to take
[16:26] opportunities God bless you

[28:24] tonight amen praise the Lord so let's um
[28:26] let's go to the scripture we're going to
[28:28] go to um I have here numbers U Joshua 14
[28:33] and:
[28:35] 11 just want to read
[28:42] one or rather from verse
[28:47] 10 actually let's no let's go up further
[28:50] go to verse 5 this is this is Caleb
[28:53] speaking to
[28:54] Joshua okay from so from verse 5 now and
[28:57] and Joshua 14 sorry I don't have a
[28:59] slideshow so we're just going to do the
[29:00] oldfashioned thing today amen so Joshua
[29:02] 14:5 says as the Lord commanded Moses so
[29:05] the children of Israel did and they
[29:07] divided the land then the children of
[29:09] Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal and
[29:11] Caleb the son of Jeff the kenite said
[29:14] unto him thou knowest the thing that the
[29:17] Lord said unto Moses the man of God
[29:19] concerning me and thee in Kadesh Baria
[29:22] 40 years old was I when Moses the
[29:24] servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh
[29:25] Baria to spy out the land and I brought
[29:28] him word again as it was in Mine Heart
[29:31] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[29:32] with me made the heart of the people
[29:35] mouth but I holy followed the Lord my
[29:37] God and Moses swear uh on that day
[29:40] saying surely the land wherein thou feet
[29:42] have trotten shall be thine inheritance
[29:45] and thy children's forever because thou
[29:47] Hast fully followed the Lord my God and
[29:50] now behold the Lord hath kept me alive
[29:52] as he said these 40 and5 years even
[29:54] since the Lord spake this word unto
[29:56] Moses uh while the children of Israel
[29:58] wandered in the wilderness and now low I
[30:00] am this day four score and 5 years old
[30:03] as yet I am as strong this day as I was
[30:05] in the day that Moses sent me as my
[30:07] strength was then even so is my strength
[30:10] now for war both to go out and to come
[30:13] in now therefore give me this mountain
[30:15] of the Lord spake uh in that day for
[30:17] thou heardest in that day how the
[30:20] anakins were there and that the cities
[30:22] were great and fenced and if so be the
[30:25] Lord will be with me then I will be able
[30:27] to draw drive them out as the Lord
[30:29] commanded and Joshua blessed him and
[30:31] gave unto Caleb the son of jeffan Hebron
[30:34] for an
[30:35] inheritance praise the Lord amen let's
[30:37] bow our heads in a word of prayer
[30:39] tonight amen hallelujah PR oh precious
[30:43] Lord Jesus truly How Great Thou Art my
[30:45] God we love you Lord we thank you for
[30:47] this great privilege dear God to to

[31:11] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[31:14] God bless you friends you can have your
[31:16] seats uh tonight so I want to speak
[31:18] about uh Caleb here and I want to take
[31:22] from uh from from verse uh 11 how he
[31:25] says as my strength was then even so my
[31:28] strength is now now we understand that
[31:31] Josh uh Caleb when he uh Caleb was there
[31:34] in uh in uh Egypt we know and uh we
[31:38] understand that the strength that he
[31:40] came out uh with and was able to be as
[31:42] strong as he was at 85 years old as he
[31:44] was at 40 was because he took the
[31:47] Passover in Egypt I believe the
[31:48] supernatural strength that we receive
[31:51] from when we become one with our Lord
[31:53] Jesus Christ and that you know we can
[31:55] look back at our lives and we can say
[31:58] truly the Lord's it's by the Lord's
[31:59] strength and his mercy and his grace and
[32:02] his ability we are still alive and well
[32:04] that we're still serving the lord it's
[32:07] not been by Our Own Strength our own
[32:08] Works how smart we are how how we have
[32:11] worked things out it's by him that we
[32:13] are standing it's by him that we're
[32:15] strong Amen Let the weak say they are
[32:18] strong amen let the poor say they are
[32:19] rich amen hallelujah the blind say they
[32:21] can see amen cuz our God is more than
[32:24] sufficient he's more than able and we
[32:26] can say we're strong now as we were when
[32:28] we first believed amen that God has kept
[32:31] us he has led us he has equipped us he's
[32:34] protected us amen it's been him from the
[32:36] beginning to the end amen and it will be
[32:39] into eternity amen so we can stand like
[32:41] Caleb stood he says I'm imagine 85y old
[32:45] man saying I have not diminished in
[32:47] strength one bit compared to when I was
[32:50] 40 years old amen he's he was just as
[32:53] strong and the reason he was just as
[32:55] strong is because he had a he had a
[32:57] Worthy that he had to fulfill which was
[32:59] taking that inheritance amen taking that
[33:01] mountain amen that was the word of God
[33:04] that he had to fulfill in his life and
[33:06] God gave him strength that he would
[33:07] fulfill that word now friends we have a
[33:09] word to fulfill too amen that they were
[33:12] Char sleep amen noten you the dead in
[33:14] Christ are raised and they which are
[33:16] alive and remain will be caught up with
[33:17] them to meet the Lord in the air amen
[33:19] that is our scripture we are called to
[33:21] fulfill amen so God Will Keep Us strong
[33:24] he'll keep us able amen he'll keep us
[33:26] loving him and until that scripture is
[33:28] fulfilled and after that scripture is
[33:30] fulfilled we'll be dancing on streets of
[33:32] gold amen and when we hug each other
[33:35] Embrace each other when we're all look
[33:36] 18 to 21 whatever whatever our Peak
[33:39] looks are whatever that is amen we'll
[33:41] say it was the Lord that brought us here
[33:44] amen it wasn't our strength it wasn't
[33:45] how smart we were as you know it wasn't
[33:48] how we put it all together it was all
[33:50] him hallelujah amen you think about
[33:53] Joshua you know he you know when when he
[33:55] took the Passover the the first you
[33:57] could say communion you know as a shadow
[33:59] back there in the Old Testament you know
[34:01] he didn't know what what what was
[34:02] awaiting him all he knew there was a
[34:04] land promised amen that's all he had
[34:06] amen and you know so they in faith they
[34:08] applied the blood and they and they and
[34:10] they became one with that lamb and they
[34:12] ate the unle bread and they walked out
[34:14] of Egypt now if we go to uh
[34:17] Deuteronomy um Deuteronomy I think it's
[34:20] 29 here and we want to go down to verse
[34:24] 5 uh a few years between
[34:28] what we just read or before uh Moses
[34:31] would give this declaration to realize
[34:33] it's God's strength it's God's strength
[34:35] it's not your strength it's not my
[34:37] strength it's God's strength amen we are
[34:39] walking by the strength of the Lord
[34:43] hallelujah I like that don't you amen I
[34:45] like it when we just look back and say
[34:47] Lord it was you it is you amen so in
[34:49] Deuteronomy 29 we'll read from verse
[34:51] five he says here and I have led you 40
[34:54] years in the wilderness your clothes are
[34:56] not waxing old upon you and thy Sho Is
[34:58] Not wax n upon thy feet amen so he's
[35:01] saying here that the clothes you walked
[35:03] out on in are still good they went
[35:05] through Desert Sands they went through
[35:07] Rocky places imagine imagine trying to
[35:09] wear the same pair of clothes for 40
[35:11] years the same
[35:13] shoes you would be walking in maybe some
[35:16] shoelaces if you had half of one left it
[35:18] would have all been worn out as in the
[35:19] walk but because they left Egypt under
[35:22] the blood of the Lamb amen God God gave
[35:25] them strength God equipped them aen men
[35:28] that that that what they were walking in
[35:29] when they left out did not wear out
[35:30] friends I say Amen this gospel keeps
[35:33] amen it doesn't wear out this salvation
[35:35] doesn't get old it doesn't perish it
[35:37] doesn't get threadbear amen but it stays
[35:40] as strong and vibrant and full of life
[35:42] as it was when you first become one with
[35:44] him hallelujah amen but you look at
[35:47] Joshua now you what a blessed man he's
[35:50] taking the Passover he has no idea
[35:51] what's going to what's going to face him
[35:53] but he but but he can look back and say
[35:55] God has come down with a mighty hand
[35:57] amen when I could not deliver myself I
[35:59] could not help my own family God came
[36:01] down answered my prayer brought
[36:03] Deliverance into my house and God sent a
[36:05] prophet amen sent a word amen smoke the
[36:08] Egyptians and now we're walking out in
[36:09] the morning Hallelujah and one of these
[36:11] mornings friends we're going to be
[36:12] leaving this world Amen why because God
[36:14] has sent a Vindicator word to prove
[36:16] Calvary Works amen it's going to take
[36:18] you from this world to the next World
[36:20] Hallelujah I me there's Caleb now he's
[36:23] leaving he could he he could you know
[36:24] think back about what happened there
[36:26] with the plagues but then he into the
[36:27] Red Sea Watch God Amen open a way where
[36:30] there seemed to be no way and drown his
[36:32] enemy behind him when he walked through
[36:34] amen he could remember now when um you
[36:36] know he was there at Mount Si God came
[36:38] down his word God God revealed his word
[36:40] to him and something anchored that word
[36:42] anchored in his heart it didn't to the
[36:45] others but it did him and that's the
[36:47] main thing what has it done for you amen
[36:49] what has it done for you this message
[36:50] has transformed us we didn't work it out
[36:53] we didn't have to say well make it all
[36:55] fit it just fit somehow I mean we're
[36:57] like the woman at the well amen come see
[36:59] a man who's told me all the things
[37:00] they've ever done is this not the very
[37:02] Messiah amen this is what this message
[37:04] is is Messiah revealed amen so he could
[37:06] rejoice in those things and you know
[37:08] what I love about uh Caleb God allowed
[37:11] him to go into the promised land to
[37:14] search out where he was going to live
[37:16] someday amen and then come back with the
[37:18] evidence that that land is good and
[37:20] friends we amen we God allows us by his
[37:23] grace Amen to to Taste Of Heaven to
[37:26] taste where we're going to live some day
[37:27] when the Holy Ghost sweeps down and
[37:30] fills your life and lives out of you and
[37:31] you see the word being manifested and
[37:33] maybe you're living under a cloud but
[37:35] just the wind of the Holy Ghost begins
[37:37] to blow and you begin to sing a song or
[37:39] something and what heaven comes down am
[37:42] mean what is that that's a taste of
[37:43] where you're going to live it's just a
[37:45] little shadow of it but it's just but
[37:47] it's still amen it's still glory amen
[37:49] comes down and sweeps over your soul so
[37:51] he came back after spying out the land
[37:53] saying the land is good amen and and
[37:56] then and then he could say listen I was
[37:58] looking around there's a lot of nice
[38:00] places but when I saw that mountain
[38:02] something in me said that's yours amen
[38:04] and we can say the same thing with the
[38:05] word am mean you read the scripture you
[38:07] hear the message and there's and there's
[38:09] Parts there's promises where just
[38:10] anchors in your heart that's
[38:12] yours amen I trust the Rapture is a
[38:15] revelation to you tonight amen that's
[38:17] anchored in your heart that's yours amen
[38:19] and what God gives you have amen amen he
[38:22] doesn't give it and take it away he's
[38:23] not an Indian giver he gives it then he
[38:25] makes sure you receive it amen just like
[38:28] Caleb when God revealed to Caleb that's
[38:30] your Mountain God made sure he was going
[38:32] to get it CU he gave him strength to do
[38:36] it Hallelujah yes sir he lived such a
[38:41] life not by his own ability but by the
[38:45] strength of the Lamb he could remember
[38:49] one day when they were fighting the
[38:50] amalekites I think it was and Moses was
[38:52] on the mountain and his hands were
[38:54] raised and he saw Victory be manifested
[38:57] cuz the man's ra hands were raised up on
[38:59] a mountain and we can look back and say
[39:01] the victory that's we've seen in our
[39:02] lives because the king of kings and Lord
[39:05] of lords hands are raised on Calvary on
[39:06] a mountain amen a victory was won a
[39:09] great victory over hell death in the
[39:10] grave and we can look back and say Lord
[39:12] you won it there because you w it there
[39:14] I'm going to live out that Victory
[39:15] because of what you've done hallelujah
[39:19] the Lord praise God Caleb went through a
[39:22] lot of dark times a lot of difficult
[39:24] times but that didn't change who he was
[39:27] in the Lord right God allowed those
[39:30] things to happen but something anchored
[39:31] in Caleb I ain't staying here kades
[39:34] barer was not his end destination cor
[39:37] and Dayan splitting the church wasn't
[39:39] his end destination amen the unbelief of
[39:42] the Elders of his of his peir group
[39:44] caused him to walk in the you know
[39:46] desert for 40 years that was not his end
[39:48] destination God told him you've got to
[39:50] remind God sometimes you've got to take
[39:53] the scripture God is quick into your
[39:55] heart and you've got to remind God just
[39:58] like God youo Caleb reminded um Joshua
[40:00] remember what Moses told me remember
[40:03] what you were there Joshua when when
[40:05] Moses told me I'm going to take the land
[40:07] now I'm here the Mountain's here I'm
[40:10] here I want what God has given me
[40:12] Hallelujah God loves it when we quote
[40:14] his word back to him
[40:17] hallelujah amen so friends I just I I
[40:21] just want to keep it close like that but
[40:25] I'm sure we can look back say Lord 2024
[40:30] the reason I'm still here is because of
[40:31] your strength because of the strength of
[40:34] the Lamb it wasn't how smart I was how
[40:37] whatever I did it was you Lord
[40:41] hallelujah and we can and now we can
[40:43] look at the start of 2025 or well
[40:45] actually we're nearly a month down but
[40:47] you know a lot of children some have
[40:48] already gone back to school some are
[40:49] going to school I pray when you step
[40:52] into those school grounds you say Lord
[40:53] this may be a new class maybe a new year
[40:56] maybe different school but Lord I'm
[40:58] coming in here by your
[41:00] strength amen I don't know what I'm
[41:02] going to face I don't know what spirit's
[41:04] going to try and grab me I don't know
[41:05] what's going to happen but I don't fear
[41:06] those things because I'm walking by Your
[41:09] Divine strength I'm not trusting in my
[41:12] ability how smart I think I am or things
[41:14] I can work out I'm trusting in your
[41:17] strength in my life and parents we can
[41:19] all do the same thing amen young old
[41:21] whatever age we are we can say Lord
[41:23] because you live because it's your
[41:26] strength I'm going to walk into this
[41:28] year trusting you like never before gu
[41:32] what's beautiful the more you walk with
[41:33] the Lord the more you can look back and
[41:34] say God you've kept me God you've
[41:37] preserved me God you've taken me out a
[41:39] lot of tight spots God in spite of me
[41:42] you you I wanted to W off the path but
[41:44] you brought me back lord father you've
[41:46] done so much more to me and I'm so
[41:48] thankful for it Lord that's so we can
[41:51] just have such such confidence friends
[41:53] it doesn't matter what you're whatever
[41:55] you're going through Caleb went through
[41:57] a lot of things but it was the strength
[42:00] of the Lamb hallelujah hallelujah and
[42:03] what are we going to walk through this
[42:04] year Overcoming By the strength of our
[42:08] lamb and we we know that our our lamb
[42:11] wasn't just a natural lamb it was the
[42:13] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[42:15] the world I mean so if he could walk out
[42:18] of Egypt there by the natural blood of a
[42:20] lamb and eating a natural lamb and yet
[42:24] and he could overcome like he did how
[42:26] much more you and I friends
[42:27] under the blood of Jesus Christ becoming
[42:30] one with our
[42:31] sacrifice amen Our God's good we're
[42:35] going to make it Hallelujah you let's um
[42:38] wait let's just read one more scripture
[42:40] let's go to Jeremiah I I'm sure most of
[42:43] us could quote it but let's just go to
[42:45] Jeremiah
[42:47] 29:11 I'm sure we could all you know but
[42:50] I read this I saw it somewhere but it's
[42:52] just
[42:53] um Jeremiah we're going to read this
[42:56] then we're going to go to
[43:08] um
[43:14] sorry now I read this I saw it and it
[43:18] was the
[43:20] NIV and I can't remember the most of
[43:23] what it said but I just remember the
[43:24] last part of the verse and in the so
[43:26] I'll just just read this in the King
[43:27] James for I know the thoughts that I
[43:29] think toward you sayeth the Lord
[43:30] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[43:32] give you an expected end the NIV it says
[43:35] instead of an expected end it just says
[43:37] to give you a
[43:38] future and a hope but we don't live by
[43:41] hope we live by Revelation and what to
[43:44] me an expected end is far deeper than a
[43:47] than a than a future and a hope cuz our
[43:49] expected end is what
[43:52] Rapture isn't that our expected end we
[43:54] came from God we go back to God and how
[43:57] are we're going to do it by the strength
[43:58] of the Lord by the strength of our lamb
[44:01] amen so as we as we come to the
[44:03] communion table tonight I pray would
[44:06] just say thank you Lord you know I know
[44:08] it's always a special time when we
[44:09] gather around and we you know we take of
[44:11] the Lord's table than we have uh foot
[44:14] washing I pray we can look back at the
[44:17] previous years and or just the previous
[44:19] year and you know sure we've had
[44:21] failures we've had disappointments we've
[44:22] had hardship and all those things but I
[44:25] trust we can look back at those things
[44:26] and say Lord brought me through by your
[44:29] strength and Lord as I go into this new
[44:32] year new school new school year whatever
[44:34] it is lord it's going to be by your
[44:36] strength that I'm going to walk through
[44:38] those things amen so let's just
[44:41] um let's just
[44:44] uh well well let's go to 1 Corinthians
[44:46] 11 and chapter 23 and we're going to
[44:50] read here
[44:51] um down to down to verse 34 so 1
[44:55] Corinthians 11:23 down to ver verse
[45:06] 34 amen he says for I received of the
[45:08] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[45:10] you that night the Lord Jesus the same
[45:13] night in which he was betrayed took
[45:15] bread and when he had given thanks he
[45:17] broke it and said take eat this is my
[45:19] body which is broken for you this do in
[45:22] remembrance of me after the same manner
[45:24] also he took the cup when he had SED
[45:26] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[45:28] my blood this do ye as of as you drink
[45:31] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[45:33] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[45:35] you do show the Lord's death till he
[45:37] come where uh wherefore whosoever shall
[45:40] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[45:42] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[45:44] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[45:46] examine himself and so let him eat of
[45:48] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[45:50] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[45:52] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[45:54] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[45:56] cause many are weak sickly among you and
[45:57] many sleep for if we would judge
[46:00] ourselves we should not be judged but
[46:02] when we are judged we are chastened of
[46:04] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[46:06] with the world wherefore my brethren
[46:08] when you come together to eat carry one
[46:10] for another and if any man hunger let
