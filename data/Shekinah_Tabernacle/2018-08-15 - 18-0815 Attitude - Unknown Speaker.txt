just to be away for a while and just enjoy themselves so we just pray and bless those that are streaming tonight also we pray we just commit ourselves to you in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord thank you now you can have your seats actually my um sometimes I don't have a typical scripture to start and why I'm assuming with and this one's kind of one of those one say but I have scriptures all the way through I just don't have one it's that - I'm work with brother Adam was saying something about having a funny week not that it means much but I was at a I had a bit of a schedule to keep today and you know and your mind you finger cave and the morning I'll do this and it will take me till about this time and then I'll do this and listen this and then I leaned up homie at such a time and then will come here you kind of have it all planned out you know I was apart from a slight sleeping which is typical I am over half an hour or something I was am on time we had to finish off a job I started the day before I'm laying a floor and I just finished it and the the older guy there said could you give me a hand to move the fridge back into the spot so we had to move the fridge across the floor into where the fridge goes and I say yeah I'll give you a hand to do that and we put boxes down and rolled this thing and all was well and he we put it in the little spot where it goes and I just lifted up the boxes to check there was no damage there and when I lifted up it was a mess of scratch going right across the new floor so I put the Box down real quick as he was there he was about to go out well maybe I can just you can't fix these things up and no one knows about it this is a few little tricks but so he left to go and you know I couldn't fix this thing I tried went and bought some walnut you can actually get it's a little trick for you if you scratch your timber products you can get a piece of walnut and rub it on the scratches yeah didn't work I got I was getting fuller rubbing that in there doing all sorts of things nothing works man and then when you got back about 45 minutes later he said all right I said now there's actually a big scratch all the way through this floor so I had to like I would have had to come back at some point and replace the floor side just did it when I was there but I had to unclick it all from you know flooring it's like difficult you can't just flick it back and the in spots were really hard on the fridge was here so it took me about a couple of hours to unclick all these boards and then replace these three pieces and then take all the other pieces back and it kind of reminded me I thought about it I thought you know you can do one little event one time just a small event we did and yet the the trouble that it caused that we had to try and undo this little bit of damage that we've done life is like that you know it's good to be careful the way we walk because we can make a just do a little thing what seems so small and could happen so quickly and there's a lot of time to to try and put everything back together so this was a couple of hours so I was a couple of hours behind schedule and as a result I couldn't quite I couldn't get to another job to pick up a tool to do the next job I had to do so I had to go I'm sort of gone by at all just grinder and then all the I was trying to grind the job in all the parts the grinder wouldn't works all the parts weren't clicking together because you can't have to mess with us for a while it wouldn't work I finally got it to work and I was actually on schedule to leave for that job at 4 o'clock but I just cut out a whole lot of other jobs because I couldn't get to them and then I was driving home and my wife rung me up she had some good news I can't mean what it was then she said I'm by the way and now I was grinding before I had all this dust all over me and it's all like feeling me jack and he said oh and another thing happened today she said we actually ran out of water the middle of winter eh you ran out of water but I think because it rains you don't really think to keep the tanks but the gutters I think must have been a bit blocked or maybe it hasn't actually rained much this winter I think it hasn't rained much I don't think it has anyway so he said I've to say but that's all right there's still some water up in the heater tank you know cause like I wanted to give all the dust off me but that hot water cylinder there's only on a weak bit system so if you so I said okay that one's going and it's called there's a small amount of water and the heater tank that's left over but as the fire going because the hot water cylinders that only works on a wet back that particular cylinder that feeds from that tank she said oh no I'll quickly like the fire now so she I think and I was about 20 minutes from hind so she'd cook me lit the fire and be to try and heat up that was what a cylinder it kind of half with and we made it here in the end but that wasn't really a bad day there with these were small problems they weren't really problems and they were just there were things you just can find solutions for in it sometimes we have problems where they are no solutions you know you know those problems that's actual problems you know the children complain about this problem that problem but there's an easy solution even if it takes a day some problems there are no foreseeable solutions and those are the ones where you say Lord I need you for this one okay that's not my sermon but I'm I've only got a sermon it tonight I haven't had a lot of time to do my usual pull a whole lot of things together but I've avoided runny-nosed I've avoided I'm preaching for about the last month I've managed to sidestep it and get other people up and brothers have come and they've taken the spot size of minister wheeze them all out of it for about a month but I've been got me this time because brother Andy took last week you know when I was a younger when I was younger I wanted to be at the front but nobody would let me now that I'm slightly older I want to be at the back and no one will meet me but I think this out is in the Lord when we go on it but we realize we actually don't have much of ourselves to say in to offer you know and we're a bit more cautious of how we deal in life because we realize we're not really there we're not overly smart we're not we're not as wise as what we thought we were and we just trust in the Lord I mean okay let's um the message I want to speak about tonight I've made some of the words a bit bigger but not this one um it's I had this funny thought that called attitude and I want to just speak about attitude for a little while this evening and attitude as a player our attitude plays a major part in our life you know we have different attitudes as we go through days and and we may have the same attitude towards something for a very long time this way or that way and the word attitude actually isn't in the King James because the actual word itself wasn't the word attitude that we know wasn't made up until after the King James Bible was translated so you won't actually find the word attitude in the other we all know what it means but I just got the meaning for myself and attitude means a feeling or opinion about something with someone or a way of behaving that is caused by this attitude it's got a good attitude today that's what we want a good attitude hey man now this is not so much going to be a bit how to get a good attitude and you know just because we're talking about attitude I'll just say a few things about the the just about our natural attitude but this is more going to be about our spiritual attitude but but there are but it it encompasses a lot of things and our attitude is actually governed by if I can articulate a property or by our thought process essentially determines how what our attitude will be in a situation or towards anything because it's a result of the way we think about something for instance let's say brother Andrews about to get married and he's found this the girl of his dreams found her you know so he's found the girl of his dreams hypothetically speaking now because in his mind he's been wavy waiting for a wife for so long and he's trusting in the Lord and then eventually he finds a wife and it's this that has the the girl that he meets as the girl of his dreams so he's got the thought process in his mind that she's the girl of my dreams she's so awesome she's just so wonderful to be around and we have so much fun together and she's a great Christian and and all these things and and because that's a thought process then has attitude we need surround her and towards her will always be a reflection of a thought process you'll always be hey how are you how was your day you know I brought you this you know and his attitude towards it will be really really good and that's the way that it should stay so they get married and it should stay that way and now let's take someone else because Andrew wouldn't do this but let's take a non-christian person they may they may start off that way but then over time they begin to get used to this person and they get to know the little things that they do and don't do and woods they say that are annoying or things they do they're annoying or little thought patterns they have that you think oh here she goes again the certain way you know and over time that can start to you can you can start to change the way that you think about here because you've experienced a bit and if you don't watch it it because you start to let those things change your thought process towards who then your attitude will start to get different towards here no it won't be like what it used to be it you'll start to maybe get grumpy and you won't be as happy to see here as often and all these and and you maybe might talk your talk to her in a way that you wouldn't do earlier in the piece because your attitude has changed and as a result of your thought changing but a Christian shouldn't do that this is a bit of marriage advice look it's it's the journey we we take but now this is not just in marriages but in any relationship it's important you've got to guard it and treat it well and in always always uphold the other person and high esteem you know whether you've known them for one month for one year or ten years always hold other always hold people in high esteem the Bible says to esteem each other greater than ourselves and see if you if you always hold that thought towards any person that you're in a relationship with then your attitude towards them will always be positive now because you esteem them and your thought process towards them is always good and you'll have a positive attitude towards him we're not going to go down the road of starting to have bad thoughts about people in and then having negative attitudes towards them that's not the way we want to go and who's ever started a new job you know and you've been trying to go for this job for such a long time and maybe you've you haven't studied for years and then you finally landed your job at that dentistry hey you know and you've studied when you're a little girl do you want to be a Newark he didn't but may at some point in life sister Hannah wanted to become a dentist assistant yeah yeah yeah she thought that's what I want to do and she would have studied for years and and then over time maybe she would have finally gotten the job that she wanted to get as a dentist dentist assistant and you would have been so happy maybe the first day she would have been so happy to be there and wants to learn and wants to please the boss and do all these things because here your attitude towards the whole job and everything would have been positive in helping I want to help out and then maybe she would come across people in the the same workers who that were a bit negative and she would think man why are they like that this is the greatest job in the world you know I'm so happy to be here and maybe here attitude would have would have encouraged them but maybe if she didn't watch it she wouldn't do this but someone else over time they you start to get butt sick of the way the bosses like this and you know they they always do this there and that there and why don't that why do they book the jobs like this and we you know we we have to use these machines why don't they get these other machines and you know you can start to get slowly change your thought process towards that the user can start to get negative you know and and then your attitude towards the company changes but not a Christian you know not a Christian because it the way you starts the way you'll finish on your last day will be the same as your first day because you think you know what I'm what I'm here you're my boss of you you're the contractors for me to do a certain to reach a certain standard for you or your company and to support your company so that's the way I'll be from the Dow start to the Dow finished even if these things that I don't agree with I'm not gonna let that change my thought process and change my attitude I'm gonna keep on having a positive attitude towards this business because that's more that was my part of the contract and if I don't want to live up to that then I should say look I don't want to work here anymore yeah I shouldn't work here and have a negative attitude you know because that wasn't part of the agreement this is maybe my bosses head on now but some people have it I maybe I can say this they I've heard some people say this comment I don't get paid to think I'm thinking man I'll so how much do I have to pay you to think it'll cost another there's another five dollars an hour ten dollars you know I'm sure that when we agree to do something we do it to the best of our ability but the Bible says that we should do everything there's actually a scripture on that here okay so and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men Philippians 2:14 says do all things without murmuring and disputing z' all things not just most things but I can justify not doing that without murmuring because that's worth murmuring about we can often justify yes I'll do all these things but not that thing but do all things without murmuring and disputing and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him I'll give you another this is another story this is really not part of my sermon yet but I'll go on to it about how moving on about our attitude you know attitude towards life we've got to have a positive attitude towards life and um you know we don't want to be all down and negative and beer be a drain to people we want to be a positive we want to be refreshing to people you know if people come into contact with us we want to think that we could refresh them yeah and be encouraging to them and make them feel good in some way that's what that's what I think as a Christian we want to do and I mean we can only really do that if we've got something that the Lord and us it's that's refreshing us but this this may not be part of the sermon but I I thought I'd say it anyway because it was this is just a little a little thought that I've taken in life that's helped me but it may be a bit too harsh for some people but it's it's my thought process nonetheless that's helped me not to complain really at all I don't I tend to not complain to you often I was um when I first got married there was a we looked out in the country and across the road was a forestry block in a header there was a very high Ridge and Gisborne they have lots of high very high hills and apparently my neighbor had rights to go and shoot the goats from off there because the forestry people didn't like the GoSee because they wouldn't hit the back of the trees so if he had rights to what I had rights to it to we sort of figured and it was across the road so we used to go and shooting the goats the distant bring them back for dog food and um one day I went right to the top of this hill and I'm pretty sure I shot two goats this particular time and there were big billy goats and I kind of wanted to keep their horns on these things just because it keep them hanging around and I but I gathered these two goats and I thought I'll drag these all the way back down to the house which was a few Kay's away down through the blackberry and all down this big ridge and then across the road and up the river and yeah through our place and I I think I had to because one would have been easy I could have put it on my back but I was maybe 20 to 23 and so I had these two goats by their two sets of horns and dragging them but I had to drag these things through blackberries and gorse and over the logs it was through forestry and it was a it was a very steep hill I'm not exaggerating it was very hard work to drag these things down man I got to the bottom of that hill I still had to walk quite away and I was exhausted man and I thought I was dragging these things and I thought man I'm gonna tell Shannon how hard this was when I get home cuz hey that's what you dude you will do that you know you want it you want someone to know this is what I went through you know you want to tell them this is how hard I've hit it no you kind of want to complain of it you don't really complain but you kind of want you're you're you're searching for some sort of sympathy you know just by telling sugar you know we kind of you know we can get in the habit of always complaining about stuff so we can get sympathy sometimes but and I dragged them along and I thought to myself you know what even if I really tried to explain to hear about how hard this has been for me she won't really ever understand because she didn't do it with me well she she she wasn't me she doesn't know that struggle has been to drag these two goats over this distance he's a big goats she won't really she won't understand this she she'll say oh that's you know wow but she won't really fully understand what I've been through then I thought well the him why would I bother even saying much about it in if she's not really going to understand why would I really say it so my first lesson there was I thought now this may sound a bit harsh but I thought no one really cares when you think about it unless they've in this they were you they don't really care or understand fully you going through it was my first that's not so mm-hmm well I accepted that fact okay that's actually the way that it is because unless they're me but then I thought you know what the Lord knows what I've been through he knows how hard this has been for me to drag these goats down this far Lord you know how hard this has been and you care yeah and then it was from then on I've kind of taken that thought in life to not try and complain too much about what I've had to go through because the Lord knows what I've been through no and and he cares and he he actually really understands and he understands what you've been through all of us he really understands he was there with you he understood it all and I'm glad that we come to a God like that okay now speaking of now I want to go more towards the spiritual aspect of our attitude yeah and we all know the story of um Paul and Silas in prison you know we sing the song it was good for Paul and Silas and we hear the story about that when they were in prison they were singing hymns and rejoicing and sometimes me I would just read that chapter and move on to the next chapter or not think too much of it but then when you go through some hard times once or twice you try singing when you're really really in a hard battle and when it really looks like it's all pretty bleak around you and and more so you can't see the hand of God anywhere sort of almost feels like he's maybe he's he's over there and he's left you somewhere you know maybe you're walking through the valley of the shadow of death as David said it though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death you get to that spot once or twice and then you start to think about Paul and you think okay here was Paul serving the Lord going out to preach the gospel and and Minister the Word of God and then over a series of events he ends up being beaten and all these things happened to me needs that being thrown in prison and all he's trying to do is actually do good and preaching that you think maybe the Lord would give him a slightly easier road because he's out there to preach but he ends up thrown in prison and and maybe not even understanding why he's there you know we think we often would like to make sense of everything but when you really start to think about the situation it wasn't like he was in church and all the brothers li he was singing a song he was probably hungry sore and pain he would have been beaten he maybe had other report meetings he was going to go to he can't get there now and he's they just they're in prison they're in stock but then the stocks over and they can't do a lot and yet his attitude was praise the Lord you know because here his thought process was well Lord you've got a purpose for all us and as if his attitude wasn't less it wasn't that and he wouldn't have praised a little bit said they were in there and they sang and they worship God and they praise the Lord because this attitude was positive his attitude didn't change whether he was in a church service with all the brothers with with the Ephesians and rejoicing in the Lord or whether we was stuck in a prison his attitude was the same he was still praising the Lord the same so it cost him something to sing those songs in that prison it wasn't easy for him and yet we hear of another story of another negative attitude where here's a people that are in bondage and the children of Israel are in bondage and and slavery and God sends Moses down to them as a mighty deliverer and they see amazing miracles in the mighty hand of God working to to defeat Pharaoh at every turn and to keep them safe and they see that mighty hand of God working and then eventually they all get to leave Egypt there's free people not only that the Egyptians give them all of their gold and all this all these treasures these people are walking out free and rich you know you think they after all that they would have thought man this is isn't this an awesome time we're living in what we we get to walk free and we've actually got all those possessions with us and we're going into into a promised land their attitude should have been positive and yet in the first instance of any sort of hardship anything not quite going their way the first thing they did was they all started complaining yeah well you brought us out here to die now and complaining towards Moses and murmuring oh look at all the snow thee and the armies are coming down look he's just this is a big trap we've wasted our time here we would have been better off being slaves back in Egypt and eating you know we had garlic there now look what we got here and it's just complaining the whole attitude was complaining poor Moses you can understand most perspective they're here to have more character to deal with it but imagine this he's like people I don't even want to be here either but God called me when I was in the wilderness and can't you see that he's doing this what could I do I'm just a nobody like you but God just happened to call me and I'm here to actually help you've given up my life farming come here to help you and now we and we've got I've gotten us the Lord's gotten us this far now something happens all you do is complain it's the wrong attitude to take in it and God didn't actually like that attitude either because it stemmed back to a to a thought process that they didn't fully trust in God which was why they had the attitude that they had but Caleb and Joshua had a positive attitude because they believed God and they went all the way through and received the promise because they did they they had a positive attitude even when all the spies came back from the land and ten of them gave a bad report Joe Joshua and Caleb had a positive report I've got this quote here I want to read it no sorry this is a scripture I just want to read this here put this one on your fridge if F our thought process is like this script the short scripture here will be the happiest the most positive people for full you might joy that you'd be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought of not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross if you read through those if you just dissect all that and taking all those thought processes that are in here you'll be a very happy person then you'll be a very good Christian but now that's my point out these three things about our attitude the first one is we all have a free choice on what our attitude will be now this next point is a very important point in our Christian walk is that we're not judged on what we know about Christ and His Word but on our attitude towards what we know about Christ in his word and think about that one I'll cover that in a little bit and our spiritual outcome depends on our attitude towards the Word of God of course some quotes here to read brother MC somewhere you must show your life shows tonight where you are identified you are either identified in Christ or out of Christ you are not halfway there was no such thing as a drunk sober man there is no black white dude you're either saved or you're not saved you're a saint or a sinner one or the other and your spiritual attitude towards God's Word identifies you exactly where you're standing your spiritual attitude we take towards the Word of God never going out go into more of a spiritual aspect your spiritual attitude towards the Word of God shows who you are and it identifies you because if you really love the Lord your attitude towards the Lord into the things of the Lord towards his word is going to be reverent and pure and sincere that's going to be your attitude and it's going to reflect and how you act and what you do your attitude but if you're if you're just relaxed about the whole thing and not really too concerned about it then your attitude towards it it's going to be maybe or maybe I won't it's not really that big a deal it doesn't really matter maybe I've got other things to do this Sunday you know you know it's a is that but maybe God's not doesn't really care about that it's not really that important it's not you know it's it fix our attitude if you know the story of Ananias and Sapphira if you think about them this is going now to a negative attitude towards the Word of God they were a part of the believers in that time and maybe they maybe they heard of they'd heard of Jesus maybe they hadn't maybe they'd only meet Peter and maybe they were at the sermon where all the souls came in and were baptized and and they witness the Peter speaking in one language and all the other people from different countries hearing them in their own tongue and they were a part of all us maybe they were involved in all these things but somewhere even through this whole process it seems like they would they were kind of in into it but they were kind of they were like no but it's it's you know if it doesn't quite work out will God do something else no the attitude wasn't really sincere and and they were kind of I guess they were drawn unto thee maybe the emotion of it all in the way that it was all going and they were sort of caught up in it in a way but really they didn't really have the right attitude towards at all and maybe all their other friends were selling up their homes in giving to the the church so they thought well it seems to be what we're all doing at the moment we'll we'll sell our home too and give the money to the church you know but they couldn't quite see why they were thinking that's a bit of an extreme move though you know what if we what if it doesn't work out we're gonna eat me up with no home they say they always had this the attitude wasn't towards the Word of God and towards the things of Christ wasn't right it wasn't it wasn't fully hundred percent towards the things of the Lord they were mostly for the Lord with your attitude was and their thoughts were towards other things as well and so when they sold their home you can imagine them they were talking about it after the sale and thinking why don't we just keep let's just maybe we got 50,000 for let's just maybe keep 10 grand and would just say be that we got 40 grand for it we'll keep the other 10 just in case this whole thing doesn't work and you know we can we can go in that holiday you've always wanted you know now now we will you make a joke about it but they made light of it that's actually the way they would have thought was we'll keep some aside and they went and you can just adjust thinks of like insincere no no real reverence towards the things of God you know that's what that's what it seems like that they had and so Ananias went to Peter and he said here's my forty thousand I sold the house here praise the Lord we can you know the kingdom of God can be moved forward but Peter discerned something was wrong in the ass Peter why is Satan filled your heart that your life to the Holy Ghost no you see when your head the house wasn't at yours and then when you sold it the money was yours and yet you came here and you lied and you mate you made life of this whole thing you thought that ice it's you know it's not much in it he obviously wasn't that since he didn't think he was much in it you could just go and tell a lie think oh honey we'll just we'll say it's for this much and we'll just lie to these guys and you know they weren't know anything about it and when he realized he'd been found out the Bible says that he he was so stunned by it that he actually dropped dead and died and that in that moment because he had that he had the wrong attitude towards the whole thing and then his wife came in afterwards and Peter said did you sell the house for this much and she said y'all sold for this much and she had the same attitude to some and she died as well now God didn't really need the money he wasn't they weren't disappointed that uh now with ten thousand dollars short we we were going to sin Peter on this trip now we can't because you didn't give the ten thousand dollars God didn't want any of their money he didn't ki wouldn't care if they kept the house Peter said Peter said when it was it was your house you didn't have to sell it God wasn't interested in that was the attitude they're taken towards the things of God that were wrong the attitude was wrong and and it stem from the thought process they made light of the whole thing there was a negative attitude now go into a positive attitude and this is an interesting story but I wanted to bring this one up because it really doesn't matter what state we're in or how far we've come of all those sorts of things it's just attitude towards the Lord that really matters and we've go to the story of the Jesus on the cross with the two thieves either side and as they're all dying on the cross one of the thief's thieves has got it enough he's got enough in and to start railing on this other man on the cross next to him what an attitude it's like you're all they're dying men and you're going to now and you your last breath you're going to make fun of the guy next to you you know maybe maybe you should think of something nice to say and your last breath your last few hours of life and yet his attitude was so negative if you're the Son of God just think like like what these people think you out why don't you you know save yourself and save us in the process yeah what a bad attitude no wonder he was up on the cross he was probably like that in his life just negative attitude every rent and and I don't think he was really concerned that he was a thief I think he stole things and it didn't even prick his conscience that he stole he'd go and steal things steal off an old lady look what I got wouldn't think much of it seems like that sort of guy but there were two thieves on the cross and there was another thief there that was just as guilty and yet there was something in him a different attitude a different attitude now I don't know how many times how many sermons this guy had been to how many times had been to the synagogue obviously not many if he was a thief it didn't read about him you know I for an eye tooth for a tooth yeah what are the repercussions of a thief you know they would cut your arm off your hand off he obviously didn't study enough to find help and really take too much concern for it and yet he was actually concerned but he was just doing other things but when it really came down to it on the cross he actually had a different attitude and and even though he was still a thief he was still wrong he actually in that moment when the Lord was there he said he said to the other guy look look man I love this guy's attitude he said look man you and I are both thieves you know you're a thief I'm a thief we deserve to be up here but this man here he's not a thief maybe he was at the trial he was hearing what they were saying he's saying all they're accusing him of as I preached this and he did that but he's when you think about it he would have thought logically when you think about he's really done nothing wrong he is they didn't give any testimonies of he you know he stole or he hurt people or anything that they accused him of healing on the Sabbath day he's thinking hang on men there's nothing wrong with this guy leave him alone as attitude towards towards and the little that he knew his attitude towards him was different his attitude was different he said leave him alone and then he actually actually had enough of an attitude and them to say Lord when you go into your kingdom remember me maybe you would have thought to himself you know what I've got no other options I'm gonna be dead in a few hours maybe this is the son of God Lord remember me I don't think you do it as a back-up plan but maybe something came on him when he was drawing his last breath he said Lord remember me now he wasn't I wouldn't call him a profound Jew you know maybe he was Jewish but I wouldn't I wouldn't call him a very godly man and yet in that time all he had to do was have the right attitude towards Christ and he received mercy and the little that he knew he just had to have the right attitude and that was enough for him brother Branham says and he said in his Bible that he would judge the world by Jesus Christ and we read here that Jesus is the word and Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever so therefore he will judge the church by their attitude towards Christ who was the word notice he says attitude towards Christ he won't judge us by how much we know about Christ he will judge us by what we do with what we know with our attitude towards him because that makes it fair for everybody the thief all the thief knew was I think he's a good man there's nothing wrong with this man his attitude was he was judged by his attitude towards Christ so give an example of this young was David young David thinks mad I want to go and join the army in the US Army because I'm half American citizen some others American he thinks I want to join the army so so he maybe goes and runs in the bush and gets all army ready and then he applies for a replace through the Americans to join the army and he gets a letter back saying yeah you can join up to our army and so he starts pumping us wait so you think she's got to be tough to be in the army and he gets big muscles and everything in his foot he's ready to go and he signs up to the army and his attitude as man I want to be a good soldier I want to go out and wherever they say wherever they see me that's where I'll go I just want to serve well I want to be a good soldier I want to make my momma proud she doesn't want him to go but he wants to be a good soldier and so he turns up there and he's ready to go and he wakes up in the morning and then before he knows that here's this guy yelling in his face look at the state of your bed you think you're gonna be a soldier okay if he says make the bed good then I make the bed good knee makes the beard as tidy as he can then he realizes okay if that's the deal then every morning I wake up I'm gonna make this beard as tidy as I can cuz that's what my job is that I thought we would get gonna shoot guns and shoot everything but apparently not apparently I just have to make beards but hey he's the boss he's in charge I'm not I'm gonna make this beard the best I can every morning because that's what he asked me to do okay so that's this as far as he got with that one now we take another one he's maybe someone that's been in the Army for 30 years I like this I like these older pictures and see the general up here with on the horse maybe he's a faithful loyal general in peace he follows orders down to the T he's a he keeps his regiment and good condition he's he sound he's a sound man he's a temperate man the men respect him and he's a very good general and he's and maybe he's got to go and fight certain battles that he doesn't even know why he's there he's saying why we approach you from this side we should be on that side nonetheless they told me approach from this side they must have some plan that I don't know I approach from this side and he was faithful and loyal and maybe he'd won many battles and and and all the different facets of what it means to be a soldier he ticked all the boxes and he had the positive attitude had a positive attitude towards the name was a very good soldier and and he had a very good reputation now let's this look at this and we think okay let's say after one week of David being in the army and after 50 years of this guy being in the army and doing all these things let's say after Davis been in a week both these men David and this man and for some and some strange circumstances both died on the same day did now you think to yourself when you really ask the question you think who was the better soldier of these two when you really think about it who was the better soldier and you have to say they actually were both very good soldiers and neither one was better than the other they both had a positive attitude they were going to serve well the only difference was one man got more of an opportunity to and another one didn't but how can you say oh he was bitter because he did that well hang on if he'd have hit that much song he would have done that too you know and I say that about the young people you know it's actually if you're just starting up serving the Lord you're actually you see a net on that basis you're not any less maybe some of us have been down the road while so we've had to do other things and yet if your attitude towards the things of the Lord as Lord I'm going to serve you the best that I can and the Lord's eyes that is just as good as someone has been there a long time and you think wow they're animate they're an amazing Christian God doesn't see it like that he doesn't look at things like that that would be unfair to look at things like that he looks at it there so that's your attitude towards the Lord now see next year we grab it and we change we think man I was well I can't believe I did that back then and yet back then that was all we knew and that's what we did so don't young people don't ever feel discouraged that you're actually on the Lord's eyes what you have to do is actually have to have a positive attitude the right attitude towards the Lord and that's actually all you've got to do you know and then you just walk in the light that he shows you I'm gonna skip this now do it real quick I'm just gonna rush through this now I'm gonna be finished soon this is just this is just a play out to go on forward with that concept for a little bit you could have two people they could do the same Sun and once right and ones wrong on this with the same sort of basis and that's because one person's attitude is I don't care and the other person's attitude is I do care I just failed see it's their attitude they did the same thing and yet one was right when the outcome of both was right and wrong that's your attitude and you know what if you have always got that attitude lord I do care I just failed the Lord will always forgive you always you could do the same sin this may sound extreme but you could do the same sin every day of your life till you die and you'll still be perfect the Lord wants after 20 years saying it's been 20 years now I think and this is the 1300 time you've done that I've had a bit of I've had enough of this I think no I'm not going to forgive you this time you see cuz he tells us we say the disciple said Lord how long should we forgive our brother he said 70 issue we forgive him this many times he says seventy times seven and a day you know and if he tells us you forgive him this bit almost seemed like infinite then how could he turn around in and not give us the same deal you see it's our attitude but if our attitude ever changed well I don't really care that's different because now our attitude is wrong yeah attitude is wrong it's their attitude that makes all the difference in our walk with the Lord now I want to show you this one here because this is along the same lines that if God will judge you by what your attitude was to Christ and His Word then he will also reward you by what your attitude was to Christ in his word your attitude and and the reward because you know there's a reward for the believers the reward is not based on the amount of what you did but the true value of what you did and and I couldn't think of another word to just to think of what the true value was but it's along the lines of what we're talking about it was a story and it's the concept is and this story here with us with the widow woman and brought Jesus is sitting down near the synagogue at one day with the with his disciples and they're watching the priests and the different believers and different people throwing in money into the offering box at the synagogue giving me paying their tithe to the Lord and then that what a woman comes up and she puts in it she puts in two mites which is next to nothing and Jesus points out to this this woman and he points to the situation and he said to her I want to tell you something about what's just happened over here that woman there that throwing the two mites has thrown and more than all the other people he actually said all the other people put together she's thrown and more because she said the other people that through their money and they had they hit they just threw it out of the earth they had a hundred they had five hundred they threw and twenty they still hit or they threw an hundred they still had 400 left it wasn't really a big deal to them they but she only had two mites she Jesus said she threw an offer want meaning she was actually already a negative she didn't have any to hardly begin with and that was all she had she probably had to pay bills with it you know that was all she had she's thrown off who want she put that in now the difference in these two was attitude I think you'll find that these these people that's throughout $100 if he only had five hundred dollars in the air bills to pay of one thousand he would not have put their 500 dollars in no way he wouldn't even probably wouldn't have put the $100 and because his attitude was like well I don't really believe it this much to do it and yet who attitude was Lord this is all I've got but I'm gonna give it to you and look if you reward me or whatever I'm just gonna give it to you and just move on because I've I just want to go one thing I want to I want to give to your kingdom at least maybe your Foudy very else in life I would I got this - now everything else is foul but at least I can do this for you at least all I can do something and walk away thinking you know what at least the Lord will benefit us in a small way from my life you know it was your attitude was different now it's not the amount of what we do it's our attitude and I want to show you yet this may be too small for you to read but we'll just do a few more quotes and then we're done Matthew 5 verse 1 says in this is a Sermon on the Mount Jesus says blessed are the poor in spirit for these is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which hangar and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you now I want you to look at those scriptures those scriptures are not about doing a single thing you if you do all those scriptures you're going to end up with a whole kingdom and so much of a reward you love the earth you'll end up with everything and yet that doesn't say you have to do a single thing it's all about attitude it's all about attitude blessed are the poor in spirit that's an attitude lord I can't but you can bless of the day that mourned you know blessed are the meek Lord on the humble people Lord I just blessed are they which hangar and thirst after righteousness blessed are the merciful Lord you've shown mercy on me I want to show mercy upon others you see there's going to be many a poor widow woman that are going to be far wealthier and heaven then someone that's done all these wonderful things and I'm glad the Lord's made it like this that our reward is not based on what we do it's actually based on our attitude it's on an attitude towards what we do because then it makes it a level playing field because we can all determine our own attitude and all of these things the reward is based on our attitude how we react how we do things you know you think well I'll never go up and preach I'll never do this I'll never do that they actually it doesn't say after blesses other preachers they shall inherit the earth blessed are they that do all these things it actually doesn't say that it's got to be a fair playing field it's got to be fair you might think you have achieved you might say look I haven't had to did anyone leave no one to the Lord of my entire life but yet if you know your heart Lord I've been faithful wherever you've called me I've gone I've done this you know when I felt to bring someone something I brought it to them you know you if you can learn your deathbed and think Lord when you called answers and I went and and I had the right attitude you know and I always tried to keep peace where I went and all these things you've got a massive reward waiting for you according to these scriptures based on your attitude not based on what you do not based on your achievements and and that should be encouraging to whichever part of the body you find yourself in it's a level playing field it's fear and I'm so glad the Lord's fear I used to think you know if you do more you get more but doesn't work like that it doesn't actually work like that it's attitude now just I'll just read these three more quotes as an open I'm closing and I go on record and I say this about the Word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God he will bring it to pass for other p.m. said I'm gonna go on record here quote this he's saying quote this if you can take the right mental attitude towards any promit divine promise of God he'll bring it to pass if we can have the right attitude it will happen the way the Bible said it would happen let's skip that one two more what does that the quickening power come into the church making here already in this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh god help us to receive it help us to believe it see it depends on what attitude you take to it whether it's going to do you any good or not though you won't have to believe that if you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good all of this depends on what attitude we take towards it one more and the Gentiles are called out the bride's really the rapture is at hand can we realize that can we actually believe that is it a story that's been told as that a myth to us is it something that sounds real is it something that we can that we outside can believe or is it something this and us that's part of us that it's more than life to us what attitude do we sit in this morning in this Tabernacle remember it'll be a small flock that receives it what attitude have we got towards what we've heard Peter had the right attitude when everyone was leaving Jesus said a few things that sounded to put it in our terms we would understand crazy unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you've got no life in you suddenly they weren't inviting him back to preach you know you think about it put yourself in that time and even Peter himself didn't understand what was going on and yet when Jesus said to him will you go also what was his attitude his thought process was look I don't understand what you're talking about but there's something in you there's something about you this is what he's thinking there's something about you that that's that's more than all this even though I don't understand it I'm gonna follow you but I haven't found there's something about you that I haven't found anywhere else and he said Lord to whom shall we go you alone his the words of eternal life his attitude was Lord doesn't make sometimes doesn't make sense to me but I'm going to follow anyway because these are something in it amen and that's [Music] that's what a believers attitude as towards Christ one of the prerequisites for being a disciple he said unless you forsake all and follow me you cannot be my disciple we added you when you forsake all your attitude as the Lord you're in charge what are we doing what you say goes that's our attitude whatever you say goes if you say this I did this if you say that I do that you say don't do this I don't do that you say do this I'll do that you're in charge not me I've forsaken all that's our attitude and unless we have their attitude we actually cannot be his disciple that's not my words that's just the way the Lord has said it when we have that attitude though the whole of the kingdom of God is open to us that's actually the key having the right attitude that's the key having their attitude towards the Lord as the key to the door it opens up everything and we we enjoy everything the Lord has for us when we have the right attitude towards the Lord Lord I surrender all and I'm gonna just do the best that I can I'm gonna do everything you say I'm just gonna follow you as much as I can whether yeah this big well that big it doesn't matter if you have that attitude you're on the same lip it's a level playing for the you're at the same place as everyone else even if you're like that it kinda goes like that it doesn't matter young people old people old people aren't better than younger people know if their attitude is like this and someone's attitudes like that young or old it doesn't matter it doesn't matter and the Lord's eyes that everyone's the same like that you mean let's um let's just sing it's quite lately sing a song tonight is be close just as the musicians are getting ready let's just um this is close the service of prayer and then we'll sing one or two songs Lord Jesus we just thank you so much Lord for your word Lord and for your
