[5:43] good morning saints of god god bless you
[5:46] everyone
[5:50] everyone here in person and everyone in
[5:51] the stream i trust we all brought our
[5:53] lick of fire
[5:55] ready to lift the lord up in this
[5:56] sanctuary amen
[5:58] and just before we start um i'd ask if
[6:01] we can just stand and just read a song
[6:05] amen a familiar psalm psalms 23
[6:08] and i believe this is god's perfect will
[6:10] for us i mean let's put ourselves into
[6:12] the scripture
[6:13] [Music]
[6:16] it says the lord is my shepherd i shall
[6:18] not want
[6:20] he maketh me to lie down in green
[6:21] pastures
[6:23] and he leadeth me beside the still
[6:24] waters
[6:26] and he restoreth my soul he leadeth me
[6:29] in the path of righteousness for his
[6:31] name's sake
[6:32] and yet though i walk through the valley
[6:34] of the shadow of death
[6:35] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[6:39] my rod and my staff may comfort me
[6:43] and that prepares a table before me in
[6:45] the presence of mind enemies
[6:47] thou anointed my head with oil and my
[6:49] cup run it over
[6:51] so whatever you might be going through
[6:53] this morning you could be in the fire
[6:54] this morning
[6:55] but have no fear because the lord is
[6:57] right there with you
[6:59] it says surely goodness and mercy shall
[7:02] follow me all the days of my life
[7:04] and i will dwell in the house of the
[7:05] lord forever and ever
[7:08] amen this is what god has spoken for us
[7:10] this morning
[7:11] so it doesn't matter what the devil is
[7:15] trying to tell you or what he has for
[7:16] you
[7:17] and that's now irrelevant because
[7:20] jehovah god has the final say
[7:22] and this is what he said amen and before
[7:25] we pray let's sing
[7:26] a song blessed be the lord god almighty
[7:29] gives you
[7:31] and this morning as we sing our songs of
[7:34] praise and worship
[7:35] let's enter into the spirit and let's
[7:38] set aside everything
[7:41] everything else we have going on today
[7:44] and however you you want to express your
[7:46] love to god feel free to do it
[7:49] if you feel like lifting your voice go
[7:51] right go right on the head
[7:53] if you want to praise god in the dance
[7:55] and dance before the lord
[7:57] with your tambourine feel free to do it
[8:00] let's have freedom in the house of god
[8:01] today
[8:03] amen let's create an atmosphere where
[8:05] the holy spirit can come down and
[8:08] have his way how do
[8:11] father in heaven how we
[8:15] love you
[8:18] we lift your name in all
[8:23] the earth
[8:27] may your kingdom be established in
[8:31] our praises
[8:35] as your people declare your mighty words
[8:41] blessed be the lord
[8:46] god almighty

[25:22] amen we have a testimony from sister k
[25:25] if you like to come forward
[25:28] amen bless you
[25:32] we'll try and keep this brief because i
[25:33] can carry on a little bit so
[25:35] cut it right down but there's lots of
[25:37] details um
[25:39] i've been staying for a week with naomi
[25:41] and she lives near
[25:43] newlands and newlands is where i gave my
[25:46] heart to the lord when i was 9 years old
[25:50] and way back then
[25:55] the hills that are now covered in houses
[25:59] were covered in
[26:00] gorse and bush and
[26:03] when i was a child the children in the
[26:06] street and i used to run
[26:08] over those hills and there's a trig
[26:11] station at the top
[26:15] behind new newlands where you can look
[26:18] out across the harbour it's amazing view
[26:20] if you
[26:21] want to look there anyway so it's a very
[26:24] high point
[26:26] and it meant a lot to me because that's
[26:28] where we used to go and play as children
[26:30] so
[26:31] i just would naomi was at work i just
[26:33] drove up there
[26:34] and um i
[26:38] we got out of the car and and now
[26:40] there's just a tiny track from the road
[26:43] to the top of the trig like about
[26:47] three minutes walk
[26:50] so it was a beautiful day and i got out
[26:52] and i
[26:53] came to the park where the track starts
[26:56] and there's like a black bar that goes
[26:59] across
[27:00] the track like this to stop cars driving
[27:02] up and there's a little space where you
[27:04] can walk
[27:06] just before i got to the black bar i
[27:08] looked down there was a beautiful red
[27:10] admiral butterfly
[27:12] and it was just before the black bar and
[27:14] it was open
[27:15] just in front of me its wings were open
[27:17] it was sunning itself in the
[27:20] sun but as i walked up to it
[27:23] my shadow overshadowed it
[27:26] and it flew over that bar and
[27:30] into the sun again in front of the bar
[27:35] and i stopped and i had a look at it and
[27:38] its wings one of its wings was kind of
[27:42] um disfigured a little bit from
[27:46] flying into bushes or whatever it might
[27:48] have done
[27:50] and i thought oh
[27:53] but it was just like lord thank you for
[27:56] letting me see that and then i didn't
[27:58] think
[27:59] a lot more and i carried on walking up
[28:00] the track the track got narrower and
[28:03] narrower and
[28:04] literally it was like this narrow and
[28:07] quite steep
[28:08] and i had to kind of go carefully and i
[28:11] slipped a few times going actually up to
[28:13] the trig when i got to the top of the
[28:17] trunk station it was absolutely
[28:19] lovely you could see up buttoni the
[28:22] the hill going up to wainwa mate you
[28:24] could see into wellington all the
[28:26] harbour
[28:28] and it just was very nostalgic because
[28:30] it was my childhood days
[28:34] i sat down there on the rock and a
[28:37] butterfly
[28:38] came and landed in front of me about a
[28:41] meter away right in front of where i was
[28:45] sitting
[28:46] and this butterfly was perfect
[28:49] it had no dishevelment on the wings or
[28:54] anything
[28:54] and it was open right in front of me
[28:57] like that
[28:59] sunning itself and i thought oh lord
[29:02] there
[29:02] another one that's so beautiful thank
[29:04] you for letting me see that
[29:08] next minute another butterfly came from
[29:10] somewhere i don't know whether it was
[29:12] the first one or another one of the same
[29:14] butterflies we'd be
[29:15] admiral redhead more and
[29:19] they joined together and they did a
[29:21] dance going up into the blue sky
[29:23] together under the beautiful blue sky
[29:28] and once again i thought oh lord that's
[29:30] so beautiful thank you for letting me
[29:32] see that
[29:35] then after i'd been sitting there for a
[29:36] while they disappeared
[29:39] and another butterfly or whether it was
[29:42] the same one i don't know
[29:44] came along about a metre in front of me
[29:47] again this time it had its wings closed
[29:51] like this
[29:52] and it was facing south like facing
[29:55] wellington
[29:56] city way and once again it was clean and
[30:00] perfect
[30:01] and just beautiful it wasn't until
[30:05] a couple of days later i think i was in
[30:08] church on wednesday night or something
[30:09] was like suddenly
[30:12] i could see my life in that whole
[30:15] walk that whole journey it was
[30:20] like before the black bar i was
[30:23] disheveled and everything and the black
[30:26] overshadowed me which was
[30:29] where i was in newlands which was behind
[30:32] me
[30:33] and then i gave my heart to the lord and
[30:37] i leapt over that bar but i was still
[30:40] i was um a worldly christian you could
[30:44] say back then
[30:46] and it the journey of life got
[30:50] the track got narrower and narrower
[30:53] and i stumbled and
[30:58] i don't know what part i'm up to on that
[31:01] journey now but
[31:03] it was like when i got to the top that
[31:04] butterfly was perfect
[31:07] perfection and when you sing that song
[31:09] walk seven steps to perfection i thought
[31:11] that fits in my testimony maybe lord you
[31:13] want to share and
[31:15] share that with the saints that might
[31:16] encourage you and then it was like
[31:19] the bridegroom came and up
[31:22] into glory together into that blue sky
[31:26] i have no idea what the meaning of the
[31:28] butterfly coming back down and facing
[31:30] south as maybe the lord will reveal that
[31:32] i don't know but i just wanted to share
[31:35] it because
[31:36] who knows it might help you somewhere in
[31:39] your life
[31:40] to see the little tiny things that the
[31:43] lord can
[31:44] speak to us through praise god
[31:51] amen hallelujah we thank god for that
[31:53] testimony
[31:54] you know when we're in the spirit the
[31:56] lord shows us things you know in nature
[31:58] in way and we appreciate that god bless
[32:00] you my sister god bless you for your
[32:02] walk

[51:08] attention today
[51:12] luke 16 and we're going to read from
[51:14] verse 13
[51:15] and then we're going to go to romans
[51:17] chapter 9.
[51:23] luke 16 and 13.
[51:30] it says no servant can serve two masters
[51:35] for either he will hate the one and love
[51:37] the other
[51:38] or else he'll hold to the one
[51:42] and despise the other you cannot serve
[51:44] god and mammon
[51:45] and the pharisees also who were covetous
[51:48] heard all these things
[51:50] and they derided him and he saith unto
[51:53] them ye
[51:54] are they which justify yourselves before
[51:57] men
[51:58] but god knoweth your hearts for that
[52:00] which is highly esteemed
[52:02] among men is abominable as
[52:05] abomination sorry in the sight of god
[52:09] let's go to romans chapter nine
[52:13] i'm going to read the last i believe
[52:15] three
[52:16] three verses here if i have it right in
[52:18] my my notes can you turn me down and it
[52:20] feels like i'm booming in a cave
[52:22] somewhere
[52:24] uh romans nine and thirty
[52:29] what shall we say then that the gentiles
[52:31] which followed not after righteousness
[52:33] have attained to righteousness even the
[52:36] righteousness which is of faith
[52:38] but israel which followed after the law
[52:40] of righteousness hath not attained to
[52:42] the law of righteousness
[52:44] wherefore because they sought it not by
[52:46] faith
[52:47] but as it were by the works of the law
[52:51] for they stumbled at that stumbling
[52:53] stone
[52:54] it is written behold i lay in zion a
[52:57] stumbling stone
[52:59] a rock of offense and whosoever
[53:01] believeth on him
[53:03] shall not be ashamed amen let's bow our
[53:06] heads into word of prayer
[53:08] this morning lord jesus we
[53:11] come before you this morning with
[53:14] thanksgiving in our hearts
[53:16] also a real godly fear lord i just want
[53:18] to pray dear god
[53:20] that may we be attentive to your spirit
[53:22] lord may you
[53:24] lord just help us not to be distracted
[53:26] by anything i pray that you'll
[53:28] touch our lives this morning lord we
[53:31] don't take for granted that we can
[53:32] gather
[53:32] under your lord and your presence lord
[53:35] so i pray dear god may you just anoint
[53:37] speaker and hear her one more time
[53:40] lord i also pray that all those watching

[53:48] their bodies and heal them

[53:53] else lord i pray you'd be with them and
[53:55] dear god i pray you'll take the service
[53:57] under your control
[53:58] not our will not my will but thy will be
[54:00] done amen may you grant it father in
[54:02] jesus christ's name
[54:04] amen amen god bless you you may have
[54:06] your seats this morning
[54:10] pray god help me just now i'd like to
[54:12] speak about a subject
[54:14] and my title is don't tell me now this
[54:17] may seem very
[54:18] odd but we read there in luke chapter 16
[54:22] where you know what a scene that was
[54:26] to me this shakes me to the core here
[54:28] was the very fountain of life
[54:31] eternal life was standing in flesh and
[54:34] he was addressing a people
[54:36] that should have received him he was
[54:37] talking to a people that
[54:39] were looking for him to come but when he
[54:42] came
[54:42] they rejected him they turned him down
[54:45] and they didn't just turn them down they
[54:47] crucified him
[54:48] they called him beelzebub they the very
[54:52] one who even gave them life in their
[54:54] bodies
[54:54] not just eternal life but physical life
[54:57] gave them breath gave them life
[54:59] gave them a choice was standing right in
[55:01] front of them you think about
[55:03] how powerful it was you know before the
[55:05] lord became flesh
[55:07] you know it was all right for them to
[55:08] have schools of thought of what god was
[55:11] like in his attitude and his heart and
[55:13] what he thought and
[55:14] you know movements and religions and
[55:16] then bible schools but
[55:17] really when he became flesh all that
[55:19] should have been done away with it
[55:20] should have been closed up shop they
[55:22] should have thrown away the books
[55:24] thrown away their teachings and you know
[55:26] because the very god that gave the word
[55:28] was standing there
[55:29] he was talking to them and his heart is
[55:31] always come unto me
[55:33] heather heavy laden and i'll give you
[55:35] rest
[55:36] take my yoke upon you and lea and lord
[55:38] of me
[55:39] for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[55:41] shall find rest for your souls
[55:43] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[55:45] light that was his cry that's his cry
[55:48] now
[55:49] his cry hasn't changed come unto me
[55:52] don't
[55:52] forsake your religion and your nonsense
[55:54] and your humanity and what you think
[55:56] come unto me and i'll give you rest
[55:59] there he was what a scene you have you
[56:01] ever put yourself in that kindness
[56:02] imagine standing there
[56:04] here's the fountain of eternal life not
[56:07] just a prophet
[56:08] not just a religious man not just a
[56:10] rabbi to call them those things as the
[56:12] most discredit
[56:13] ever you put upon him was god and flesh
[56:17] and every school of thought opinion well
[56:19] i think god's like this and i think he's
[56:20] like this and he likes this and this and
[56:22] this that should have been done away
[56:23] with
[56:24] and it was it should be the same thing
[56:26] exactly in this day
[56:28] where god has revealed himself again and
[56:30] all schools of thought debate theology
[56:32] should have been thrown out to one side
[56:34] because god himself revealed who he is
[56:36] today
[56:39] but you see this word
[56:43] it says they derided him
[56:46] that word deride means to turn up the
[56:48] nose
[56:49] to snare it to scoff at so basically
[56:52] they said
[56:53] you can't tell me you
[56:56] don't try and tell us what we should
[56:58] believe
[57:00] you see the problem is people build a
[57:03] belief system and they worship that
[57:06] belief system
[57:08] and they think that's god and they think
[57:10] that's going to take them to heaven
[57:12] and they think it's going to give them
[57:13] eternal life and it didn't give them
[57:15] eternal life
[57:16] they rejected the giver of eternal life
[57:18] and they went to hell
[57:20] that was see people think by coming to a
[57:23] church
[57:25] you'll go to heaven they worship god
[57:27] through a church
[57:28] you don't worship god through a church
[57:30] you worship god through the word
[57:32] you don't worship him through what we
[57:33] think the word is you worship what he
[57:35] has revealed
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:38] and so that's what people think sincere
[57:40] people now when i talk about religious
[57:42] systems
[57:44] i'm not against any person and don't put
[57:46] this beyond the four walls of the
[57:48] message either
[57:50] don't pitch this we're not a bunch
[57:51] of farmers loading hey have you pitch
[57:53] walk to people you miss the whole point
[57:55] and so people build a religious idea
[58:00] and they basically describe some
[58:02] pharisees they had their religious idea
[58:04] they basically said no
[58:05] what we believe is god and you're not
[58:09] and they rejected him
[58:15] what you hold on to will take you either
[58:17] two places depending what it is
[58:19] it will take you to heaven or it will
[58:21] take you to hell
[58:22] what do you hold on to i trust i have
[58:26] everyone's attention right now and i
[58:28] pray you just
[58:28] let's just i don't want to stand here
[58:31] today but this is where we are
[58:36] read there and luke
[58:39] if i can just go back there
[58:52] no servant can serve two masters for
[58:54] either he will hate the one and love the
[58:56] other
[58:57] or else he will hold on to the one and
[58:59] despise the other
[59:01] you cannot serve god and mammon so we're
[59:03] going to hold on to something
[59:05] and you can only hold on to one thing
[59:07] you can't have feet in both camps you
[59:09] can't have your idea
[59:10] and god's word you can't have both of
[59:14] them
[59:14] you can only have one and the thing you
[59:17] identify
[59:18] with the most is what you hold on to
[59:24] brother branham when hit when when he
[59:25] saw the vision
[59:28] of the seven angels came coming to him
[59:32] he was there and he says and serves us
[59:34] the time of the insert because i want to
[59:36] show you history's repeated itself this
[59:37] is not 2 000 years ago this is right now
[59:40] in 2021.
[59:41] then i said lord jesus if it did not
[59:44] mean it
[59:44] mean that and it means that you'll go
[59:46] you've got something for me to do
[59:49] it'll be revealed to me later then send
[59:50] your power because he thought maybe that
[59:52] was the end of his life that blast he
[59:53] thought no man can survive that
[59:55] he says but but if it's for something
[59:57] something for me to do later send your
[59:58] power just now it says and it almost
[1:00:00] took me from the room
[1:00:02] i found myself somewhere over in a
[1:00:04] corner i could hear my wife somewhere
[1:00:06] trying to shake a door the door in the
[1:00:07] bedroom was locked
[1:00:09] and i had a bible open and it was
[1:00:11] reading i don't know what it was in i
[1:00:12] believe romans the ninth
[1:00:14] chapter the last verse behold i land
[1:00:16] zion a cornerstone a stumbling stone a
[1:00:18] precious cornerstone
[1:00:20] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:00:22] be ashamed now
[1:00:24] if you go into your bible which i trust
[1:00:26] you had it open and you read it now
[1:00:28] i have a scofield bible just out of
[1:00:30] because i've got used to where
[1:00:31] everything is but
[1:00:32] you open that there how does it go to
[1:00:35] just one verse it all looks the same
[1:00:38] god directed him to that verse so god's
[1:00:39] god's declaring
[1:00:41] that there has been 2 000 years of
[1:00:43] theology man's opinion just like before
[1:00:45] jesus came the first time
[1:00:47] but then now there's going to be a stone
[1:00:50] and it's him who whosoever believeth on
[1:00:53] him shall not be ashamed
[1:00:55] so it's a person it's not a doctrine
[1:00:58] it's not just a school of thought it's a
[1:01:01] person himself the word
[1:01:04] says now he's going to be revealed so
[1:01:07] and i went over to the window and was
[1:01:09] about 10 o'clock in the day your bed and
[1:01:10] i raised up my hands i said lord god i
[1:01:12] don't understand this is a strange day
[1:01:14] to me
[1:01:15] and i'm beside myself almost i said lord
[1:01:18] what does that mean let me read it again
[1:01:19] if it be you now this sounds juvenile i
[1:01:22] took up the bible opened it up and there
[1:01:24] it was again at the same place
[1:01:26] paul telling the jews that they tried to
[1:01:28] tell the
[1:01:29] romans that the jews tried to accept it
[1:01:31] by works but it was by faith
[1:01:33] that we believe it so they
[1:01:36] but if you think about it they did they
[1:01:38] had a faith
[1:01:40] they said we believe moses we believe
[1:01:42] our prophets
[1:01:44] but their faith but they tried to they
[1:01:46] they
[1:01:47] they built a whole religion around doing
[1:01:50] man-made things
[1:01:51] now i'll say this the liberal and the
[1:01:53] legal all in the same boat
[1:01:55] because they try and justify their own
[1:01:57] selves in their own state by what they
[1:01:59] do
[1:02:00] the liberals say well i'm saved by grace
[1:02:01] i can do what i want no
[1:02:03] grace is a divine influence upon the
[1:02:05] hardness reflection in the life if you
[1:02:06] really found grace there'll be a
[1:02:08] reflection of it in your life
[1:02:10] the fruits of the spirit the life of god
[1:02:12] the word of god will be manifested
[1:02:13] through you that's how you know you
[1:02:14] found grace
[1:02:16] right and it's not by our own humanity
[1:02:18] that we keep the word of god
[1:02:20] people have tried it for centuries and
[1:02:22] has abusively failed
[1:02:25] so they tried to find faith
[1:02:28] or they tried to become righteous
[1:02:32] but why by what they did and by doing
[1:02:36] what they did they rejected the one who
[1:02:38] wanted to give them eternal life
[1:02:40] i hope this is kind of making a bit of
[1:02:42] sense so they rejected the word the word
[1:02:44] was there to give them eternal life
[1:02:47] but they they they derided him they put
[1:02:50] up their nose at him they rejected him
[1:02:52] saying my system is god you're not
[1:02:57] you say well this was 2 000 years ago
[1:02:59] this is denomination this is not
[1:03:01] denomination but this
[1:03:02] is message where people will take quotes
[1:03:04] and they'll put them together and put
[1:03:06] them together and they think then they
[1:03:07] have god
[1:03:08] and they just have a form of religion
[1:03:10] they have no power they have no reality
[1:03:12] they have no life but they've got an
[1:03:13] argument
[1:03:14] the pharisees had a good argument but
[1:03:15] that's all they had they didn't have the
[1:03:17] life of god
[1:03:22] so when with the opening of the seals
[1:03:25] it was the lord himself coming into the
[1:03:28] church
[1:03:29] and to some he's a stumbling stone
[1:03:32] because they stumble because they
[1:03:33] justify themselves saying but i'm a good
[1:03:35] christian
[1:03:37] and they stumble the pharisees thought
[1:03:38] they were good too they were esteemed
[1:03:40] highly in front of other men
[1:03:42] oh look at them look at how they keep
[1:03:44] the law and they do all these things
[1:03:46] oh they're so devout people and wow look
[1:03:48] at how they dress all the tithing they
[1:03:50] give and all the outward things they do
[1:03:51] and and jesus said you're a bunch of
[1:03:53] sepulchers dead man bones
[1:03:56] that's all you were but outwardly they
[1:03:58] were highly esteemed
[1:04:00] by men but jesus says was highly
[1:04:03] esteemed by men
[1:04:04] god calls it abomination it's a filthy
[1:04:07] stinking thing he detests
[1:04:09] though it may look very good on the
[1:04:11] outside it's an abomination because
[1:04:13] people's motives look at me i'm the best
[1:04:15] believer there is
[1:04:17] and they crush others around them that's
[1:04:20] what the scribes and pharisees did
[1:04:23] now it says in psalms 106
[1:04:27] and they serve their idols which were a
[1:04:29] snare unto them
[1:04:30] they s yea they sacrificed their sons
[1:04:33] and daughters unto devils
[1:04:34] they shed innocent blood even the blood
[1:04:36] of their sons and of their daughters
[1:04:38] whom they sacrificed unto the
[1:04:40] idols of canaan and the land was
[1:04:42] polluted with blood
[1:04:43] thus they were defiled with their own
[1:04:46] works
[1:04:46] and they went a whoring with their own
[1:04:48] inventions
[1:04:50] so they invented a belief system and it
[1:04:52] caused innocent people
[1:04:54] to die they built their an invention is
[1:04:57] something because you need to invent
[1:04:58] something to
[1:04:59] to to improve your life but they
[1:05:02] invented
[1:05:02] a a religion to appease their own guilty
[1:05:05] conscience
[1:05:06] so now they had this way of worshiping
[1:05:08] god whatever it was
[1:05:09] you know they thought well this is but
[1:05:11] they would defile with their own works
[1:05:16] how are we today what we hold on to will
[1:05:19] take us one or two places
[1:05:23] they went to whoring after their own
[1:05:24] inventions it was to appease their own
[1:05:26] conscience they shed innocent blood
[1:05:28] and you can kill someone's character and
[1:05:30] that's murder the prophet tells us
[1:05:33] it's not stabbing someone in the back
[1:05:34] with a knife but by killing someone's
[1:05:36] character as a murder
[1:05:38] that's shedding innocent blood
[1:05:43] you must be very careful how we talk
[1:05:44] about one another be
[1:05:46] very careful how we talk about people
[1:05:47] even in the world how do you know
[1:05:49] there's not a predestinated seed
[1:05:51] and you're throwing them into the dirt
[1:05:52] and throwing it or a brother or sister
[1:05:54] at least people are trying but you throw
[1:05:55] them in the dirt
[1:05:56] that's murder that's killing someone
[1:05:58] we're not here to kill each other we're
[1:06:00] here to kill the devil cast him out of
[1:06:01] this place
[1:06:02] that we don't hold on to him and his
[1:06:04] filth but we hold on to the word of god
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:07] but the problem is it comes very close
[1:06:09] you see the rich young ruler
[1:06:11] he lacked one thing he was a very good
[1:06:14] message believer
[1:06:16] he knew conduct daughter doctrine and
[1:06:17] knew all the quotes he knew how to dress
[1:06:19] he knew how to act he knew how
[1:06:20] all those things went together but he
[1:06:22] lacked one thing
[1:06:24] jesus says one thing you lack
[1:06:27] and he had a choice and he decided to
[1:06:30] hold on to that thing that lacked
[1:06:32] because he wasn't willing to sell all he
[1:06:34] had give to the poor take up his cross
[1:06:35] and follow the lord
[1:06:36] he wanted to keep his identity that
[1:06:39] everyone thought he was a good
[1:06:40] rich young ruler and we all know where
[1:06:44] he ended up
[1:06:49] it's not
[1:06:53] i'm just proverbs 21 and 2. this is from
[1:06:56] the amplified bible
[1:06:58] every man's way is right in his own eyes
[1:07:01] but the lord weighs and examines the
[1:07:03] hearts of the people and their motives
[1:07:06] so everyone is right in their own eyes i
[1:07:08] think i'm right today
[1:07:10] i'll be honest well the scripture says
[1:07:11] that i think i'm right if i was wrong
[1:07:12] i'd do something else
[1:07:16] but it's the lord that examines the
[1:07:18] heart
[1:07:19] the lord looks beyond the veneer
[1:07:22] he looks down into the soul and he said
[1:07:25] it's either full of light or full of
[1:07:27] darkness
[1:07:28] there's only two things you know this
[1:07:30] message is not something we just grow
[1:07:31] into
[1:07:32] you don't just fit into a mold and you
[1:07:34] become a believer you're birthed
[1:07:36] by the seed of god the word and crypto
[1:07:38] you really do meet them brother brahm
[1:07:40] says after the seals open everyone must
[1:07:41] have an experience of the baptism of the
[1:07:43] holy ghost
[1:07:45] and it's an essential thing that we must
[1:07:48] receive
[1:07:54] the prophet tells us
[1:07:57] he says in enticing spirits see people
[1:08:00] hold on
[1:08:02] to their religion instead of holding on
[1:08:05] to the word
[1:08:06] and it can be a message quote religion
[1:08:09] the world is full of it in some places
[1:08:11] i'm not looking at anyone particularly
[1:08:13] when i say that
[1:08:15] but we're not meant to hold on to quotes
[1:08:17] and that's going to take us in a rapture
[1:08:19] you meet the one who sent the quotes
[1:08:21] which is the lord jesus christ himself
[1:08:25] they rejected the lord basically they
[1:08:27] said we don't tell us how to live
[1:08:30] don't tell me what to believe my
[1:08:31] religion is god and not you that's what
[1:08:33] the scribes and pharisees are basically
[1:08:34] saying
[1:08:35] he was the word that healed the sick
[1:08:37] raise the dead cast out devil set the
[1:08:38] captives free
[1:08:39] but they held on to their own religious
[1:08:41] systems instead of forsaking them and
[1:08:42] letting
[1:08:43] and then letting him hold them brothers
[1:08:46] has an enticing spirit
[1:08:48] now today so many people are listening
[1:08:50] he says now this is sunday school i love
[1:08:52] it look so many people are listening to
[1:08:54] enticing spirits instead of taking the
[1:08:56] word of god
[1:08:58] spirits they're in the world they're
[1:08:59] demons they go out into places and get
[1:09:02] amongst men and ministers
[1:09:03] they get amongst church members they get
[1:09:05] amongst good people they cause them to
[1:09:08] come into
[1:09:08] a illusion and they say things and do
[1:09:12] things and teach things and practice
[1:09:13] things that's contrary to the word of
[1:09:15] god
[1:09:16] today ministers of their congregation
[1:09:17] allowing their people to play cards in
[1:09:19] the churches many of them that's not all
[1:09:20] together catholic
[1:09:22] that's a lot of protestant does that
[1:09:24] what their
[1:09:25] what they tried to do is substitutionary
[1:09:27] something
[1:09:28] they tried to adopt some new plan they
[1:09:30] tried to adopt education to take place
[1:09:32] of the holy ghost you'll never be able
[1:09:34] to do it
[1:09:35] no matter how well your man is educated
[1:09:37] i think it's a good thing for me to be
[1:09:39] educated
[1:09:40] but if he hasn't got the holy ghost with
[1:09:42] that his education will do
[1:09:44] no good education will never take place
[1:09:46] to the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:09:48] amen so it says it causes them to go
[1:09:51] into an
[1:09:52] illusion what kind of illusion
[1:09:55] well i belong to church i'm a good
[1:09:57] person i pay my tithes i'm a loyal
[1:09:59] member i've been here for years
[1:10:00] you know i've you know i've i've given
[1:10:03] myself to this
[1:10:05] you know and and then also we can just
[1:10:07] bring into the ranks of the message
[1:10:08] which is really what i'm talking to
[1:10:10] today
[1:10:10] they say well i'm okay because i believe
[1:10:13] the message
[1:10:14] people justify well we believe the whole
[1:10:16] mess is therefore we've got the holy
[1:10:18] ghost therefore we're going into rapture
[1:10:19] brother braham says in the token don't
[1:10:21] come just this far say i believe the
[1:10:23] message
[1:10:24] you obey the messenger come into christ
[1:10:27] you say well i believe every word
[1:10:29] brother branham that's good but that's
[1:10:31] just being able to read
[1:10:34] take the message shake it into your
[1:10:35] heart they must have the token the very
[1:10:37] life that was in christ be in you
[1:10:39] when i see that i'll pass over you so
[1:10:41] it's all people say well i believe the
[1:10:43] whole message therefore i'm a believer
[1:10:45] no that's just being able to read the
[1:10:46] prophecies
[1:10:47] but they come under an illusion by
[1:10:49] seeing a mental agreement with the word
[1:10:51] they think they've got it but they're
[1:10:52] holding on to a religion that's been
[1:10:54] formed
[1:10:54] instead of meeting the god that brought
[1:10:56] thy broad eternal life that is eternal
[1:10:58] life
[1:10:58] himself and becoming one with him is
[1:11:01] this all right do we all
[1:11:02] understand where i'm coming the apostle
[1:11:04] paul asked the question have you
[1:11:06] received the holy ghost since you
[1:11:07] believed
[1:11:08] that's a very good question we should
[1:11:09] ask ourselves and don't throw it off by
[1:11:13] well what experience is big enough
[1:11:14] what's happened in your life has changed
[1:11:16] you
[1:11:19] amen people justify not fully
[1:11:22] surrendering to god
[1:11:23] because they feel the results they see
[1:11:25] in their lives validates them
[1:11:27] and then god overlooks their iniquity
[1:11:30] which is not a
[1:11:31] living according to the word they think
[1:11:33] but i do this therefore god will
[1:11:35] overlook this part of my life that's not
[1:11:37] how it works
[1:11:38] there is no easy step there's no side
[1:11:40] step into something
[1:11:41] well look i do this i'm a christian i
[1:11:43] read this i post these things
[1:11:44] on instagram i do this no no we got to
[1:11:47] line up with the word
[1:11:50] and i'm not just talking about dress
[1:11:52] code i'm talking about our attitude
[1:11:54] towards others
[1:11:56] if we've got to attempt to find a buzzer
[1:11:57] and just want to kill everyone across
[1:11:59] our path there's something wrong with us
[1:12:01] that's a demon power that's motivating
[1:12:03] someone's life
[1:12:04] we should have love for one another
[1:12:07] brother abraham says and humble thyself
[1:12:09] this is after the seals opened if
[1:12:11] if that matters to anyone now surely
[1:12:13] after all these years on the field and
[1:12:15] around the world and seeing different
[1:12:16] people
[1:12:17] i ought to know a little bit about the
[1:12:18] gate to internet
[1:12:20] and if you want to get somewhere with
[1:12:22] god who wants to get somewhere with god
[1:12:24] never let an arrogant spirit ever come
[1:12:26] around you don't let no malice come in
[1:12:29] no matter what anybody does if they are
[1:12:31] wrong don't you
[1:12:32] ever build a complex against that person
[1:12:34] we're not here to build complexes we're
[1:12:36] not here to build walls one ahead of
[1:12:37] build up defenses and
[1:12:39] forget it i want to get somewhere with
[1:12:41] god
[1:12:42] what's an arrogant spirit well i'm
[1:12:44] better than that person well at least
[1:12:45] i'm not like that person becomes an
[1:12:46] arrogance of pride look at what i
[1:12:48] am i don't care what i am who's he he's
[1:12:50] the important one
[1:12:52] amen you be sweet and kind remember god
[1:12:56] loves you when you're in sin
[1:12:58] and if the spirit of god is in you you
[1:13:00] love the other person when he is in
[1:13:02] wrong
[1:13:02] see just pray for them and love one
[1:13:04] another
[1:13:05] amen hallelujah that's how we should be
[1:13:09] we're all human by the way hallelujah
[1:13:13] amen so the stumbling stone has come
[1:13:16] again in this end time
[1:13:18] people stumble when the word is
[1:13:19] manifested it's very easy just to talk
[1:13:22] about the message talk about church but
[1:13:23] when god comes down
[1:13:24] and manifests that word people stumble
[1:13:26] at it people stumble at divine love
[1:13:29] people believe and stumble at it
[1:13:31] so-called believers they stumble at it
[1:13:33] because they say how can this be and
[1:13:34] this is not right now that's just
[1:13:36] pentecostal whatever they try and
[1:13:37] shove it off on something else just like
[1:13:39] the pharisees did they weren't willing
[1:13:41] they were holding on to what they
[1:13:43] crafted
[1:13:44] of the word we're not here to build
[1:13:47] idols
[1:13:50] people take certain scriptures and
[1:13:51] doctrines and if something steps on
[1:13:54] their toes they puff up and they just
[1:13:56] basically have a heart attack nearly
[1:13:58] you know what happens among believers is
[1:14:00] many times
[1:14:01] things become allowed in lives
[1:14:04] and then that thing that's allowed they
[1:14:06] run rampant with it
[1:14:08] you can take and you know for example
[1:14:10] and this is not against your own who's a
[1:14:11] hunter
[1:14:12] but people become hunters and fishermen
[1:14:14] just because the prophet was
[1:14:15] if you do those things i'm not speaking
[1:14:17] against him but you know people run
[1:14:19] rampant with it
[1:14:20] and it becomes their little thing they
[1:14:22] do and that's all they they forsake all
[1:14:24] and they do those things
[1:14:25] and if you speak against it say don't
[1:14:27] don't touch my little thing
[1:14:30] or christian movies or anything in the
[1:14:32] world any little pet thing
[1:14:35] hello everyone you're understanding what
[1:14:37] i'm saying and you know you know it's
[1:14:39] like they have this little
[1:14:40] this little treasure because they're
[1:14:42] allowed it i'm allowed this
[1:14:44] and instead of letting the lord uh what
[1:14:46] do you call it
[1:14:48] moderate it we should be so sensitive to
[1:14:51] god if we get into something too much
[1:14:52] god should say
[1:14:53] that's too much you need to you need to
[1:14:56] actually
[1:14:56] forsake that thing what about your
[1:14:58] family what about yourself what about me
[1:15:01] that's how we should be shouldn't it you
[1:15:02] know if we because we're people we get
[1:15:04] enthused about things and god made us a
[1:15:06] certain way we're not robots
[1:15:07] but if we get caught up in saying too
[1:15:09] much we should be sensitive to the lord
[1:15:10] to say and lord you say hold on
[1:15:12] you really need to cut back on that
[1:15:15] but some people don't have that
[1:15:17] relationship and they get this one
[1:15:18] little thing and it just becomes their
[1:15:20] whole life
[1:15:21] but yet they come to church they listen
[1:15:23] to the message of somehow
[1:15:25] they pay their tithes whatever but they
[1:15:26] have their little thing and if you stand
[1:15:28] on that thing
[1:15:28] won't be unto you for speaking against
[1:15:31] my little thing
[1:15:32] that's holding on to the wrong thing
[1:15:39] jesus says in matthew 21 jesus saith
[1:15:41] unto them did you not
[1:15:43] never read in the scriptures the stone
[1:15:45] which the builders rejected the same as
[1:15:47] become the head of the corner
[1:15:48] this is the lord's doing it is marvelous
[1:15:50] in our eyes therefore i say unto you the
[1:15:53] kingdom of god shall be taken from you
[1:15:55] and given to a
[1:15:56] nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
[1:15:57] so jesus saying basically
[1:15:59] because you can't accept me who is the
[1:16:02] word
[1:16:02] the kingdom of god is being taken from
[1:16:03] you given to another who'll bring forth
[1:16:06] the fruits thereof and whosoever shall
[1:16:08] fall on this stone
[1:16:10] shall be broken that that stone is the
[1:16:12] word of god
[1:16:14] but on whomsoever it shall fall it will
[1:16:16] grind him to powder
[1:16:18] i don't want to become powder i'd rather
[1:16:20] fall on the wood and be broken
[1:16:22] take my life lord mold it shape it
[1:16:24] anything any any country think of me
[1:16:26] just lord
[1:16:27] take it from me i don't want it lord and
[1:16:29] when the chief priests and pharisees had
[1:16:31] heard his parable they perceived that he
[1:16:33] spake of them
[1:16:34] but when they sought to lay hands on him
[1:16:36] they fed the multitude because they took
[1:16:38] him
[1:16:38] for a prophet
[1:16:43] we can't justify ourselves
[1:16:46] in what we do at all
[1:16:50] our christian walk should not be our own
[1:16:52] justification of ourselves
[1:16:54] but i'm a good person that doesn't
[1:16:56] matter
[1:16:58] we can't think well god will overlook
[1:17:00] this little thing in my life that i hold
[1:17:02] on to
[1:17:03] and i'll get to heaven
[1:17:07] he says he speaks a parable in luke 18
[1:17:12] and he says and he spake this parable
[1:17:14] unto certain
[1:17:16] which trusted in themselves that they
[1:17:18] were righteous
[1:17:19] and despised others then he went to the
[1:17:21] parable of the two in the temple
[1:17:22] once the public and the other ones the
[1:17:24] whoever and he thinks he's so awesome
[1:17:26] he's praising god he's not like the
[1:17:27] publican and the republicans can't even
[1:17:29] look up he just looks down says lord
[1:17:31] forgive me
[1:17:32] be merciful upon me a sinner and that
[1:17:34] man we're not justified but the other
[1:17:36] one didn't go out justified
[1:17:38] so we can't trust in our own ability
[1:17:40] amen
[1:17:41] remember when it comes to salvation
[1:17:43] we're not in partnership with god
[1:17:45] it's him it's his work
[1:17:49] our walk is not us and him either it's
[1:17:51] him
[1:17:52] amen it's not us living brother brahm
[1:17:54] says if beethoven was in me
[1:17:56] i do the works of bite home and he says
[1:17:57] i and beethoven can't live in the same
[1:17:59] house
[1:17:59] one of us has to be dead for the other
[1:18:01] to live same thing with jesus christ
[1:18:03] if jesus christ is in me then the works
[1:18:05] of jesus christ i'll do
[1:18:06] because it's no longer me living but
[1:18:08] it's jesus christ the word living in me
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:15] this isn't a this is an age of people
[1:18:17] being offended
[1:18:19] social media has has just allowed people
[1:18:21] to become a lot more offended
[1:18:23] and everyone's offended at something
[1:18:26] doesn't matter if it's the environment
[1:18:27] or whatever's going whatever's trending
[1:18:29] i'm not going to list anything but
[1:18:31] whatever people get offended
[1:18:33] and when jesus came the first time
[1:18:35] people were offended
[1:18:37] he even would save john the baptist
[1:18:39] blessed us he whosoever shall not be
[1:18:41] offended in me
[1:18:42] saying john don't be offended you ended
[1:18:44] up in prison
[1:18:46] and then he would speak about the
[1:18:48] parable of the sower
[1:18:50] and then there'll be a certain class of
[1:18:52] ground
[1:18:53] when they receive the word it falls into
[1:18:55] stony places the same as that that here
[1:18:57] at the word
[1:18:58] and anon with joy receives it
[1:19:01] yet hath not rooted himself but dureth
[1:19:04] for a while
[1:19:04] and then when tribulation or persecution
[1:19:06] arises because
[1:19:08] of the word by and by he's offended what
[1:19:10] does he get offended at the word
[1:19:12] the thing that's sown in his life he
[1:19:14] gets offended at and people get offended
[1:19:16] because it stands on your toes the word
[1:19:19] should stand on our toes
[1:19:20] shouldn't it hey it should actually be
[1:19:22] challenged it should be the
[1:19:23] the lord wants to challenge us how are
[1:19:26] you doing with me
[1:19:27] not in a bullying way but but we need to
[1:19:29] meet you this is such a
[1:19:30] such an affair you know people get
[1:19:32] offended don't tell me how to
[1:19:34] i need to change if god tells you you
[1:19:36] need to change i'd listen to him real
[1:19:37] good
[1:19:38] if god says you've got to lay aside
[1:19:40] something i'd say yes lord it's worth it
[1:19:43] missing heaven is not worth it for
[1:19:48] anything
[1:19:50] now i'm going to read the stream
[1:19:54] i want to i just want to weave this into
[1:19:56] this and i've been avoiding this for a
[1:19:58] very long time but
[1:20:01] here we are long time as and not just
[1:20:04] this morning
[1:20:07] so i'll read this first actually this is
[1:20:11] from a rejected king
[1:20:13] and when you die remember it doesn't
[1:20:15] change your spirit
[1:20:17] it only changes your dwelling place and
[1:20:20] whatever type of spirit you got in you
[1:20:22] that's the place it will go to and sin
[1:20:25] can never enter into heaven
[1:20:27] you say well i confess mine every night
[1:20:29] we got a prayer book and when we go to
[1:20:31] church we confess all
[1:20:32] our sins and turn right back around and
[1:20:34] do them again
[1:20:35] turn right back around the next day god
[1:20:37] forgive me for drinking forgive me for
[1:20:39] committing adultery forgive me for lying
[1:20:40] forgive me for stealing
[1:20:42] turn right back and do the same thing
[1:20:44] forgive me for getting drunk last week
[1:20:46] i don't mean to drink that much turn
[1:20:47] right back around and drink it again
[1:20:49] well that's not that shows that
[1:20:51] something hasn't changed inside
[1:20:53] you're trying to paint the outside kind
[1:20:56] of whitewash it
[1:20:57] but what it needs to be done is put it
[1:20:59] in the blood of jesus christ and wash
[1:21:01] white instead of white washed what is
[1:21:04] white wash just paint the outside washed
[1:21:06] white as the inside gets changed
[1:21:08] that's what the world needs today
[1:21:11] so now nine years ago about nine years
[1:21:15] ago when analysts was five months old
[1:21:16] christine had
[1:21:18] a series of five dreams over one night
[1:21:20] and i can read this because
[1:21:22] i'll say personally not because she's my
[1:21:24] wife but i can see when
[1:21:25] the lord has used her it's come to pass
[1:21:27] so it's trustworthy
[1:21:29] so i'm just going to read it but now
[1:21:31] remember remember what we're talking
[1:21:32] about what are you holding on to
[1:21:34] you can't tell me so the pharisees held
[1:21:36] on to something
[1:21:37] a religious spirit and it took them
[1:21:39] somewhere took them to hell so what we
[1:21:42] hold on to even though it may seem good
[1:21:44] will take us one or two places so when
[1:21:47] annelise was a baby about five months
[1:21:49] old
[1:21:50] i had a series of five different dreams
[1:21:52] over the course of a night because i was
[1:21:54] getting up to her quite a lot and if
[1:21:55] anyone remembers her back in those days
[1:21:57] she was
[1:21:58] if she slept an hour a day that was that
[1:21:59] was good each one
[1:22:02] was so clear so vivid and when i would
[1:22:05] put her back down and go back to sleep i
[1:22:07] would dream the next sequence of that
[1:22:09] each dream was so clear nothing was at
[1:22:12] all mixed up
[1:22:14] nothing was like a dream like a normal
[1:22:16] dream was very clear
[1:22:18] who's had spiritual dreams before
[1:22:20] they're very different to normal dreams
[1:22:21] i trust we all
[1:22:23] understand these things so the first
[1:22:25] ones the first one started and it was
[1:22:27] like an old movie to start with it's
[1:22:29] like a book was opened
[1:22:30] and how it started was like a story the
[1:22:33] book came open
[1:22:34] and then coming out of the pages came
[1:22:36] like a film
[1:22:38] and how it started was there's this
[1:22:40] christian family
[1:22:41] and there's this young girl who i think
[1:22:43] her name was betsy or something like
[1:22:45] that
[1:22:46] was in this family and it was during
[1:22:48] quite poor time so i think it was like
[1:22:50] in the great depression or something
[1:22:51] like that they're quite poor
[1:22:53] so but they're also very devout
[1:22:56] christian people
[1:22:57] and they had a cow that wasn't giving in
[1:23:00] any milk
[1:23:01] so she went and prayed for the cow and
[1:23:04] that cow
[1:23:04] started to give milk again and it gave
[1:23:06] so much milk until they fed their family
[1:23:08] and their neighbors
[1:23:09] in their little community and it was
[1:23:11] bursting so much they're able to swap
[1:23:13] things for the milk
[1:23:15] so that just showed she was from a very
[1:23:16] religious family that had a genuine
[1:23:18] faith a really lovely christian family
[1:23:22] i was just showing that to show it
[1:23:23] wasn't their their religion wasn't a
[1:23:25] cultural thing it was a genuine thing
[1:23:28] and that's and and that's how she grew
[1:23:30] up and then the next dream
[1:23:33] she was a lot older probably in her 50s
[1:23:35] and she had gotten married
[1:23:36] and she has this woman sort of like a
[1:23:38] 90s or 80s hairstyle
[1:23:41] uh yet you know so so she's quite a
[1:23:45] worldly kind of looking woman but yet
[1:23:47] she is a very pious
[1:23:48] everyone considered her to be a pious
[1:23:50] wonderful woman
[1:23:52] a great christian she was as lovely
[1:23:55] as you could be there was something she
[1:23:59] knew god but there was something in her
[1:24:00] life that god put his finger
[1:24:02] on and she didn't want to give that up
[1:24:05] and she didn't give it to him and she
[1:24:07] knew it and i got the assumption it was
[1:24:09] the message
[1:24:10] that she came across in the dream though
[1:24:12] i don't know for sure but i got that
[1:24:14] feeling
[1:24:15] she but she didn't go with that what the
[1:24:18] lord was showing her
[1:24:20] but no one else ever thought anything of
[1:24:22] it because no one else knew it but her
[1:24:26] everyone thought she was the most
[1:24:28] amazing christian woman and she was
[1:24:30] praised so much and in the church she
[1:24:32] was just as amazing person
[1:24:34] yet she had short hair wearing makeup
[1:24:36] she was that kind of christian
[1:24:37] now that so that's the first two dreams
[1:24:39] the third dream i'm going to admit
[1:24:41] because it relates to someone we know
[1:24:43] now in the fourth dream she was now an
[1:24:45] old lady in the hospital and remember
[1:24:47] christine used to be a minder in the
[1:24:48] hospital so minding elderly and people
[1:24:50] who need to be minded in the hospital
[1:24:52] so i was minding her or something like
[1:24:55] that
[1:24:55] and she was there and she was so scared
[1:24:58] because she said that the devil was
[1:24:59] coming to get her
[1:25:01] and she was in terror but from my side i
[1:25:04] knew nothing about her past
[1:25:06] i prayed for her and i asked the lord
[1:25:09] for mercy for her
[1:25:10] and then the room went peaceful and
[1:25:12] quiet and then after a little while
[1:25:15] suddenly she let out a scream and the
[1:25:17] devil came to get her and she died
[1:25:20] and then i woke up because annelise was
[1:25:22] crying
[1:25:23] so i just went and and and looked after
[1:25:26] analysts and i just cried to the lord
[1:25:27] said lord
[1:25:29] do my prayers not actually count do they
[1:25:32] not do anything
[1:25:34] because i pray for people in the
[1:25:35] hospital a lot i pray for people a lot
[1:25:38] do they not get saved as in there's no
[1:25:40] point praying for people
[1:25:42] then i remember asking the lord about
[1:25:43] this and i fell back into sleep
[1:25:46] and the lord said to me it does make a
[1:25:48] difference it does matter
[1:25:51] she was shown another opportunity for
[1:25:53] mercy
[1:25:54] she was shown that time in her life when
[1:25:56] she didn't accept the truth or the lord
[1:25:59] and chose her religion instead and she
[1:26:02] had the choice before her
[1:26:04] that's when the room went peaceful and
[1:26:06] quiet she had the choice
[1:26:08] so that prayer interceded for her and
[1:26:10] that devil actually was cast off her and
[1:26:12] then she had an opportunity now
[1:26:14] to accept mercy she's on death's door
[1:26:17] here
[1:26:19] she has an opportunity to accept mercy
[1:26:25] she had a choice before her to say that
[1:26:27] her own religion was a filthy rags
[1:26:30] she didn't have anything to denounce
[1:26:32] herself and take the lord and realize
[1:26:34] she was nobody but was all him
[1:26:37] but she would have to denounce all her
[1:26:39] piety all of her wonderful religion all
[1:26:41] her life and make it count as but
[1:26:43] dung that was nothing and then this
[1:26:46] voice said to me
[1:26:47] she wasn't able to do that and then it
[1:26:50] showed me her now listen to this
[1:26:53] this this look this listen and then it
[1:26:55] showed me her
[1:26:56] holding on to this demon spirit
[1:27:00] and it went suddenly dove down into hell
[1:27:03] going down down down into a pit
[1:27:06] and she was holding on and this voice
[1:27:09] said to me at any time she could have
[1:27:11] let go
[1:27:12] but that was that religious spirit she
[1:27:14] was holding onto
[1:27:16] she couldn't let it go she identified
[1:27:19] herself
[1:27:19] so strongly with it that even in death
[1:27:22] she couldn't leave it she held on
[1:27:25] and she didn't and and it and it didn't
[1:27:28] pull her down
[1:27:29] she held on to it and it took her down
[1:27:33] and i just woke up i cried so much i
[1:27:36] felt so shaken by this dream it still
[1:27:38] shakes me even now to think
[1:27:39] it was so real as they say at any moment
[1:27:41] she could have let go of her religion
[1:27:44] what what was that when and what is that
[1:27:47] when you die anyway
[1:27:48] but she couldn't let go of all her works
[1:27:51] in her life her religion her
[1:27:53] spirituality
[1:27:56] this woman had a choice
[1:28:00] but she held on to what she thought she
[1:28:03] was
[1:28:04] she esteemed her own religious works
[1:28:07] and what she believed above receipt
[1:28:10] letting go of it
[1:28:12] and actually holding on to the lord the
[1:28:15] dream said
[1:28:15] she see the spirit didn't take her there
[1:28:18] she held onto it
[1:28:20] right so she didn't get dragged down to
[1:28:22] hell she held onto that spirit and it
[1:28:23] took her down
[1:28:28] we don't want to end up in this
[1:28:29] condition you say well i believe the
[1:28:31] message
[1:28:32] you're not exempt we can form our own
[1:28:35] little message identity
[1:28:37] and i believe this doctrine and this
[1:28:39] doctrine and this doctrine i see that
[1:28:41] the apostle paul said if even though i
[1:28:43] know all mysteries
[1:28:44] and give my body to be burned and give
[1:28:47] all i am to the poor
[1:28:48] yet without charity i have nothing that
[1:28:50] tells me you can know all mysteries
[1:28:53] amen well i have a clear understanding
[1:28:55] you can know all mysteries
[1:28:57] you can give your whole life to help
[1:28:59] others well eternal life is living for
[1:29:01] others sometimes people just live for
[1:29:02] others but it's under their own
[1:29:03] motivation look at my religious self
[1:29:08] you can give your body to be burned you
[1:29:10] give your life you can give everything
[1:29:12] you can know all mysteries
[1:29:13] you can have faith to move mountains
[1:29:15] look at the results i get
[1:29:18] but yet not know him and yet
[1:29:21] at the end you'll be a failure and
[1:29:23] you'll go to hell
[1:29:24] by your own choice as opposed to letting
[1:29:27] go of that and holding on to the lord
[1:29:30] because even the prophet said i don't
[1:29:31] want to he said he said i don't want to
[1:29:33] try and get to heaven on my visions
[1:29:35] or on my preaching or any miracles he
[1:29:38] said i don't want to try and get i'd be
[1:29:39] foolish to try and get to heaven on
[1:29:41] those things
[1:29:41] all i want to get to heaven is the blood
[1:29:43] of the lord the blood of the lamb
[1:29:45] and what he has done for you and i
[1:29:46] that's all he wanted to get to heaven on
[1:29:48] that's all he wanted
[1:29:50] and it should be the same thing with you
[1:29:51] and i we have nothing to boast in
[1:30:00] to be offended
[1:30:04] it means to have displeasure
[1:30:09] it means to stumble it means to see in
[1:30:12] another
[1:30:13] what i disapprove of and what hinders me
[1:30:15] from acknowledging his authority
[1:30:18] you know you know what
[1:30:21] people do they let their problems and
[1:30:24] their complexes define them
[1:30:27] and they become their identity
[1:30:30] the ten spies that went into the land
[1:30:32] their identity came
[1:30:34] and and it was all the problems in the
[1:30:36] land that stopped them from actually
[1:30:38] crossing jordan
[1:30:39] all those things are there their giants
[1:30:41] their cities are too big there's this
[1:30:43] problem in my life and this problem is
[1:30:44] going on and this problem's here
[1:30:46] all they saw was problems and their
[1:30:49] whole life was
[1:30:50] was was their identity was wrapped up in
[1:30:52] those things
[1:30:53] but caleb and joshua weren't looking at
[1:30:56] those things
[1:30:57] they knew there was a resurrection over
[1:30:59] that river they knew there was an
[1:31:01] inheritance over that river
[1:31:02] so they weren't their identity wasn't
[1:31:04] the problems in the land and the
[1:31:05] problems in the church and the problems
[1:31:07] going on around they didn't care about
[1:31:09] those things
[1:31:09] they said and this word is a
[1:31:11] resurrection give me my mountain they
[1:31:13] didn't care about nothing else they
[1:31:14] didn't worry about problems and complex
[1:31:17] you know some complex is a god allowed
[1:31:21] brother branham had a complex against
[1:31:23] ungodly woman he had to be fashioned a
[1:31:25] certain way to be like elijah
[1:31:27] he loved real godly sisters that was god
[1:31:31] allowed if i can put it that way
[1:31:33] and we sit there and try and look at all
[1:31:34] the problems in our life and this and
[1:31:36] this and this
[1:31:37] just walk with god i'm not identified by
[1:31:40] this thing
[1:31:42] i'm not identified by my human spirit
[1:31:45] and my personality and whatever
[1:31:48] complexes i'm i have and problems and
[1:31:50] things and
[1:31:51] i'm not identified by those things i'm
[1:31:53] identified by this word
[1:31:55] i wish there could just be a curtain
[1:31:57] around me all the time and just change
[1:31:59] my voice so you can't even see me
[1:32:00] standing here
[1:32:01] i'm not identify i'm my identity is not
[1:32:04] preaching
[1:32:06] my identity is not my identity's in him
[1:32:10] but if we try and hold on to our own
[1:32:12] abilities in our own and our own
[1:32:14] religion that we're fashioned
[1:32:16] god says that's abomination
[1:32:25] in shalom 1964.
[1:32:30] it seems like that gross darkness is
[1:32:31] settled upon the people till they think
[1:32:33] the only thing there is to do is go to
[1:32:35] church and be a pretty good person
[1:32:37] put your name on the book and some
[1:32:38] little mysterious thing
[1:32:40] god will twist the key when you die and
[1:32:42] change that spirit in you to him
[1:32:44] you're mistaken when you're when you die
[1:32:47] that spirit that's on you
[1:32:48] that's the way you'll be forever
[1:32:50] remember the pharisees the sadducees and
[1:32:53] so forth
[1:32:54] was very religious people
[1:33:00] jesus says in matthew 7 i think i'll
[1:33:02] just close with this because
[1:33:07] he said here not everyone that said unto
[1:33:10] me lord lord shall enter into the
[1:33:12] kingdom of heaven
[1:33:14] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:33:16] which is in heaven
[1:33:17] that's the word of god many will say to
[1:33:20] me in that day lord
[1:33:22] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[1:33:25] in thy name cast out devils
[1:33:27] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:33:29] works
[1:33:31] and then i will proceed profess unto
[1:33:33] them i never knew you
[1:33:35] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:33:38] so i can stand here i can be a no i'm
[1:33:41] just gonna i'm just gonna talk about me
[1:33:43] i can stand here i can preach under
[1:33:45] inspiration mysteries can be opened up
[1:33:47] the word can come forth
[1:33:49] demon powers can be cast out
[1:33:51] supernatural healings take place
[1:33:53] many wonderful works could be done but
[1:33:55] if i don't know him
[1:33:58] depart from me he said
[1:34:02] and what is this pentecostal what is
[1:34:04] this religious world done in this day
[1:34:07] they major on their works either
[1:34:09] supernatural or natural
[1:34:16] that woman in that dream held onto her
[1:34:18] own religious ways
[1:34:19] and she thought god will overlook what i
[1:34:22] have turned down
[1:34:23] because of all i do and she was mistaken
[1:34:27] do you know what happens when there's
[1:34:28] the preaching of the word goes forth
[1:34:30] demons actually push back for you to
[1:34:33] receive the lord
[1:34:34] so there's actually a space of peace
[1:34:36] like her in her hospital bed
[1:34:38] where we can actually decide to hold on
[1:34:42] to a religious spirit or let go
[1:34:45] and cling to the lord and receive his
[1:34:47] holy ghost
[1:34:51] there's those things let's
[1:34:55] i don't i don't know what to say anymore
[1:34:56] can we hear the musicians please
[1:35:00] you do don't justify yourself by your
[1:35:04] christian walk
[1:35:05] and think god will overlook your your
[1:35:07] iniquities
[1:35:09] you refuse to forgive someone for what
[1:35:11] they've done to you god won't forgive
[1:35:13] you
[1:35:14] god is not a respecter of persons
[1:35:17] we don't have any special status because
[1:35:19] you're you
[1:35:23] you say well i believe the message i was
[1:35:24] raised in the message that don't count
[1:35:26] nothing
[1:35:26] you're just a very privileged individual
[1:35:28] that you don't have to be scarred by the
[1:35:30] world and then come into the truth
[1:35:32] but don't justify yourself by
[1:35:37] some message idol if i can put it that
[1:35:39] way
[1:35:40] forgive me if that sounds a bit tramping
[1:35:42] on something sacred some religious idol
[1:35:48] let's stand i want to sing rock of ages
[1:35:51] clear for me
[1:35:53] let me hide myself in thee
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:01] amen let's all prayerfully sing the song
[1:36:05] rock sorry what
[1:36:09] rock of ages
