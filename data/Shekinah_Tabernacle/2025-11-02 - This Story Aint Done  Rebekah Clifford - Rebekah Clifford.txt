========================================

The day is hot. The streets are packed. [music and singing] The sun is blazing down. Their hearts are gone so cold. I see him limping. [singing] Dragging [music] this weight that ain't his. The people look his way. But no one sees what I see. [music] Those eyes. [singing] Oh, those eyes. That's when it hits. It's all for me. He's carrying my shame. [music] He's carrying my blame. Crushed beneath [singing] the burden, but he still takes the pain. I stand here and cry while he [singing] bleeds for [music] me. &gt;&gt; Oh, the mercy in his [singing] eyes that sets [music] the captives free. He stumbles [singing] and shakes. [music] Still moving, still bleeding. And me [singing] I follow silent [music] while they throw their hay [singing] like stones. We reach the hill. Gotha. [singing] They [music] throw him on the wood like a criminal. But he's [music] not. [singing] He's not. He's not. He's the son of God. Nails to healing hands. A crown [music] of thorns adore. The sky breaks open crying. The veil of grace is torn. Thunder shakes the [singing] earth. And darkness [music] falls like storm. &gt;&gt; But even in the [singing and music] silence, I know I'm not alone. Holy. Oh, whisper, "It [music and singing] is finished." So quiet you could [music and singing] miss it. Oh, whisper, "It is finished." [music] So [singing] quiet you could miss it. Oh, whisper, [singing] "It is finished." [music] So quiet you can miss it. And just [music] like that, no wind, no breath, no life, just a miraculous fight. [singing] But you feel [music] the [singing] stillness that wait in the path between death and a miracle's cause. The story ain't [singing] over. This grave won't hold the sun. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hope is just beginning. The story end. [music] &gt;&gt; The story [singing] end. The story end. [music and singing] [applause]
