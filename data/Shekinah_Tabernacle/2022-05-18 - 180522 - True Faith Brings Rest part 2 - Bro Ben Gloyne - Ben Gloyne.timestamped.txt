[36:25] way in our midst lord in our lives

[36:32] amen god bless your friends you may uh
[36:35] yes let's take your bibles we'll go to
[36:36] daniel 3 i'm glad there's more people
[36:38] here that on sunday you've recovered
[36:40] from covert and you're back in fighting
[36:42] fit and amen we're happy to to to see
[36:44] you here so god bless you
[36:46] um praise the lord so daniel three and
[36:49] we're reading from verse 14. and uh this
[36:51] is a very familiar portion of of the
[36:54] account of shadrach meshach and abednego
[36:56] speaking to the king
[36:58] and uh so we're going to read from verse
[36:59] 14 down to verse 18 we're going to read
[37:01] hebrews 11 and verse 1. so near because
[37:03] nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[37:05] is it true oh shadrach mesa meshach and
[37:08] abednego
[37:11] do not ye serve my gods nor worship the
[37:13] golden image which i have set up
[37:15] now if you be ready that
[37:18] at that time you hear the sound of the
[37:20] corner the flute the harp the sack but
[37:22] the pulsary and the dulcimer however you
[37:24] say that and all kinds of music ye fall
[37:27] down and worship the image which i have
[37:28] made well but if you worship if you
[37:30] worship not you shall be cast the same
[37:33] out into the midst of a burning fiery
[37:34] furnace and who is that god that shall
[37:37] deliver you out of my hands
[37:39] shadrach meshach and abednego answered
[37:41] and said to the king
[37:43] oh nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[37:46] answer thee in this matter so they're
[37:47] not going to beat around the bush
[37:48] they're just going to say if it be so
[37:51] our god whom we serve is able to deliver
[37:53] us from the burning fiery furnace and he
[37:55] will deliver us out of thine hand o king
[37:58] but if not be it known unto thee o king
[38:00] that we will not serve thy gods nor
[38:02] worship the golden image which thou
[38:04] has set up
[38:06] amen i was going to go to hebrews 11 and
[38:08] verse 1 just a
[38:10] an incredibly fundamental scripture of
[38:13] the whole christian life
[38:15] hebrews 11 and 1 it says this it says
[38:17] now
[38:19] faith
[38:20] is the substance of things hoped for
[38:22] the evidence of things not seen
[38:25] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[38:27] his word tonight you may have your seats
[38:30] so i want to as i said on sunday i want
[38:31] to go into the difference between uh
[38:34] intellectual faith and real faith
[38:36] and what we need in this hour is real
[38:39] faith not not intellectual human faith
[38:42] now brother brown makes a statement
[38:43] that's in christ the mystery christ is
[38:45] revealed in his own word in 1965 he says
[38:48] now the stabilizers have been put on the
[38:50] ship talking about the ship of you know
[38:51] of zion this great gospel ship great
[38:54] fearful waves are out before us but we
[38:56] know just beyond that wave yonder we're
[38:58] nearing the shore amen so you can see
[39:00] why the world's getting worse because
[39:02] the waves are getting bigger
[39:03] hallelujah it's yeah the waves are
[39:06] the you know the world getting worse now
[39:08] we are nearing the shore it says just
[39:10] stay stabilized just stay in the woods
[39:12] stay with god no matter how you feel or
[39:15] what anything else just stay right with
[39:17] the word let it stay stable when you see
[39:20] all these great big old clouds around us
[39:23] and storms coming and atomic bombs and
[39:24] everything else they're talking about
[39:26] but our stabilizers is right straight in
[39:29] the word god said it would be here we'll
[39:31] crest every one of them yeah we'll go
[39:33] right over the top of them yes indeed
[39:36] they they can't sink us they can't drown
[39:39] us you put us in the grave we'll come
[39:41] out again that's just all there is to it
[39:44] there ain't no more in the world to keep
[39:46] it uh down there we'll crest every one
[39:49] of them because our great chief captain
[39:50] is calling at the other side so he's
[39:53] saying now stabilizers having put on the
[39:55] ship now what are those stabilizer ask
[39:57] the question now how do you stand the
[39:59] word because he says just stay in the
[40:00] word stay with god well how do you do
[40:02] that having real faith
[40:05] real revelation faith stabilizes the
[40:07] christian
[40:09] that is the stabilizers on the ship
[40:10] that's how you stay with the word how
[40:12] you keep walking with god is real faith
[40:15] not an intellectual faith where where
[40:17] it's just a collection of facts and that
[40:19] are put together that makes sense you
[40:21] know it's not that that's human faith
[40:23] but when it's revealed to you
[40:25] that is that is real faith because we
[40:28] know from james 2 and 19 it says thou
[40:30] believers there is one god thou doest
[40:33] well the devils also believe in tremble
[40:35] so the devil has a kind of faith the
[40:37] devils in hell have a kind of faith but
[40:39] the faith they have does not give them a
[40:40] body change does not give them eternal
[40:42] life doesn't give them heaven so it's an
[40:44] intellectual faith
[40:46] see so everything as i said on sunday
[40:49] everyone has a measure has a faith even
[40:51] atheists and evolution they have to
[40:53] believe because there's got to be a time
[40:54] element in their theories to make it
[40:56] happen but it's faith that puts the time
[40:58] element there see everyone believes in
[41:00] something doesn't matter what they say
[41:01] it is they still have a faith so as a
[41:04] and as as i just quoted the devils have
[41:06] faith too but their faith doesn't save
[41:08] them but the real faith of a christian
[41:10] saves them
[41:12] amen but it has to be revealed now faith
[41:15] is something this is brother brahman in
[41:17] 1951 faith is something that you it's
[41:19] absolutely it's not what you imagine
[41:21] it's a reality
[41:23] many people i say this with humble
[41:25] humility because i mean because i may
[41:27] never see you all again tonight there's
[41:28] probably people i never see in my life
[41:30] now but i say that eighty percent of
[41:32] people that comes to the platform
[41:34] doesn't know what faith is
[41:36] they have a hope but not a faith but
[41:39] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[41:41] the evidence of things not seen so many
[41:44] people have a hope well i hope it works
[41:46] i they say they believe or really they
[41:48] have a hope because it hasn't been
[41:49] revealed to them it's a mental
[41:51] understanding yes well i know there's a
[41:52] god i know jesus died on the cross yeah
[41:54] but it's a hope i hope he died for me i
[41:56] hope he purges my salvation but to a
[41:59] believer he doesn't hope or she doesn't
[42:01] hope she knows she knows he died that
[42:03] down calvary for him or her they know
[42:05] that he washed all their sins away
[42:07] that's a real faith it's a reality
[42:10] amen not a imagination
[42:13] now
[42:13] so real faith is knowing and resting
[42:16] this is just me now real faith is
[42:18] knowing and resting that our lord is in
[42:19] control and that he's leading
[42:21] doesn't matter what happens what comes
[42:23] what goes real faith stabilizes there's
[42:25] gonna be a lot of storms and many storms
[42:28] are unexpected
[42:29] right but if you have real stabilizers
[42:32] of real faith you'll crest every wave it
[42:35] may look like you're going to capsize
[42:36] but hey you got to keep going because
[42:38] you've got stabilizers on the ship
[42:40] and those stabilizers stabilize you it's
[42:42] not you stabilizing them
[42:44] amen now he says it works as faith
[42:47] express right there'll be a bit of
[42:48] reading tonight but i'm i'm going to lay
[42:50] a foundation kind of thing going into
[42:52] sunday because i kind of cut my notes in
[42:53] half so i can't put the salt and i can't
[42:56] make you enjoy this all now so um now
[42:58] faith is a revelation from god
[43:00] faith is a revelation that's where i
[43:02] want to stay just a moment it's a
[43:04] revelation he's revealed to you by his
[43:06] grace it's nothing you did you didn't
[43:08] work yourself into faith you you ever
[43:10] have faith it's given you by the grace
[43:12] of god and god reveals it to you
[43:14] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[43:16] whole church of god is built upon
[43:18] revelation remember salvation is a gift
[43:20] of god unless any man should both so
[43:22] that that salvation is a gift right it's
[43:24] nothing we earn it's nothing we mirror
[43:26] it doesn't matter how good you have a
[43:27] perfect spotless life but without god
[43:30] revealing him himself to you his
[43:32] salvation to you
[43:34] you don't have real faith yet i say yet
[43:36] but it's it's a god-given revelation see
[43:39] the world didn't give it the world can't
[43:40] take it away that's why the martyrs
[43:42] could go into the coliseum be eaten by
[43:44] lines and things so they had a
[43:45] revelation faith it wasn't based on
[43:47] circumstance how good or bad life was
[43:49] going it was anchored in them and
[43:51] nothing could take it out of them
[43:53] amen and it's got to be the same thing
[43:54] with us that faith is such a revelation
[43:58] that it's not our own human mind putting
[44:00] it together
[44:01] now since faith is a revelation from god
[44:04] it's not generated by man neither it is
[44:07] is it worked out by man see some people
[44:09] they like to say well they believe
[44:11] something because it makes sense
[44:13] don't ever stay in that bracket well the
[44:15] message makes sense oh that doctrine
[44:17] makes sense no that's just human
[44:18] reasoning by a collection of facts
[44:20] you've come to that conclusion never
[44:21] ever stay there because someone else can
[44:23] come with better reasoning and say no
[44:25] that doesn't make sense this makes sense
[44:26] that's oh i'm so glad i'm out of that
[44:28] now no no that is just human faith by
[44:31] taking a collection of facts and saying
[44:32] it's true no it's got to be more than
[44:34] that it's got to be the god of the bible
[44:36] revealing himself to you
[44:38] in his word
[44:39] amen brother brahm would say your
[44:41] baptist minister told him one time i
[44:43] can't accept revelation he says and you
[44:45] cannot accept the bible because the
[44:47] bible is divinely inspired i remember
[44:49] the first lockdown we ever had i um
[44:51] before that lockdown at work they had a
[44:53] whole bunch of books someone was giving
[44:54] away and there was one book i read when
[44:56] i was like 10 or 12 a novel and i
[44:58] thought i'm going to read that again now
[45:00] it's been a long few decades since i
[45:02] first read it i finished reading it and
[45:04] i realized it's exactly how i remembered
[45:06] it but this is a different kind of book
[45:08] this is a very very different kind of
[45:10] book i mean we can read the same
[45:12] scripture fifty hundred thousand times
[45:14] but every time it gets richer greater
[45:16] deeper means more to you i mean because
[45:18] it's god's eternal word
[45:20] hallelujah so but you've got to allow
[45:23] god to to reveal it to you by revelation
[45:26] amen it's not our own human mind amen
[45:29] that that will take us in a rapture
[45:32] otherwise i'm out
[45:34] hallelujah
[45:36] but god never wanted it that way
[45:38] he wanted it that salvation is all him
[45:41] amen so
[45:43] we must see so
[45:45] since since that so since
[45:47] real
[45:48] faith is a revelation then someone who's
[45:51] received it cannot boast in what they
[45:52] know
[45:53] or what's been revealed to them
[45:55] because they realize it was god given it
[45:58] wasn't them given it wasn't them that
[46:00] generated it it wasn't them that worked
[46:02] down their mind or put no matter how
[46:04] perfectly the quotes and the scriptures
[46:05] all dovetail together unless god comes
[46:07] down anoints that and makes it living in
[46:09] you that's just human faith
[46:12] and human faith both in itself the
[46:14] scribes and pharisees they were big
[46:15] boasters they loved to show off by how
[46:17] they dressed and the big prayers they
[46:19] gave and all the outward things but it
[46:21] was all human faith it wasn't a divine
[46:24] revelation from god so if faith is
[46:27] really revealed to you you cannot boast
[46:29] in it because it's god-given
[46:31] amen it's god himself speaking to you
[46:33] and revealing yourself and revealing
[46:35] himself to you where you might begin to
[46:37] say well
[46:39] if it's all god-given and it's nothing i
[46:41] can do what's the point of reading your
[46:43] my bible listening to the message and
[46:45] praying if i can't if i can't get
[46:47] revelation myself well the answer is
[46:49] very very simple the reason we do those
[46:52] things is that god can reveal himself in
[46:54] it to you i mean because it should be a
[46:56] hunger lord i want to know you more like
[46:57] we read i mean like we sung lord i want
[47:00] like um i remember francois lipper card
[47:02] he's a pastor in switzerland he says
[47:04] every time he reads the bible he prays
[47:06] lord may the character of you that's
[47:08] revealed in here
[47:09] manifest itself in me that's his whole
[47:11] purpose of reading the bible not the
[47:13] stuff is head full of theology but that
[47:15] god's character which is revealed in
[47:17] here will be manifested in here
[47:20] amen so that's why you read and pray and
[47:22] listen be so god can take his own nature
[47:24] put it into you because lord i want to
[47:26] know you more i want to have a greater
[47:28] relationship with with you i mean i'll
[47:30] also say cries lord i want a deeper walk
[47:33] i want a richer walk i want a better
[47:35] relationship i mean then i had before i
[47:38] want to be more like you so if you spend
[47:40] time in those things you you're giving
[47:42] god something to work with to give you
[47:45] revelation
[47:46] who wants revelation who wants to be
[47:47] more like him
[47:49] i mean so so there's great value in
[47:50] those things but don't rest on your
[47:52] laurel saying well i know all these
[47:54] things some great intellectual giant
[47:56] walking around of quotes and scriptures
[47:58] and you know it's got to become living
[47:59] it's got to become flesh
[48:01] amen because otherwise it is just human
[48:04] intellectual faith now it says in romans
[48:06] 10 and 17 so faith cometh by hearing and
[48:09] hearing by the word of god i mean so if
[48:11] you really want faith you've got to hear
[48:12] the word of god it comes by the hearing
[48:14] of the word of god that's how faith is
[48:16] transmitted into us see amen so now
[48:19] intellectual faith just makes people as
[48:22] brother brown would call them a stuffed
[48:23] shirt
[48:25] he says you take a stuffed shirt thinks
[48:27] they know it all look how great i am you
[48:29] know they've got message books and
[48:30] bibles you know this carrying them
[48:32] around and thinking they've got it all
[48:34] together all the pins and the belt
[48:35] buckle and all those things they think
[48:36] they're something
[48:37] you know they think they're god's gift
[48:39] to the bride now the only
[48:40] gift that god's given is himself
[48:43] amen so now so a stuffed shirt thinks
[48:45] they just know everything so brother man
[48:47] says this in the message fellowship he
[48:49] says you take a fellow that's always
[48:51] lord i'll do this if you'll do this and
[48:54] things like that god knows he'll be a
[48:56] stuffed shirt anyhow
[48:57] so human faith is all on condition
[49:00] lord if you do this i'll do this
[49:02] lord if you know it's all about
[49:04] condition but but real
[49:05] real faith is sold out
[49:08] a person has real revelation faith is
[49:11] totally sold out to god no matter what
[49:13] happens what comes what goes trouble no
[49:16] trouble good times bad times they're
[49:18] sold out
[49:19] i mean so we don't want to be stuffed
[49:21] shirts i don't believe i'm looking at
[49:22] stuffed shirts i'd love to look at
[49:23] genuine christians
[49:25] amen they're like lord it's all you amen
[49:27] he would say and and and the message
[49:29] that day on calvary he says now for
[49:32] repentance a remission of sin must be
[49:33] preached in his name to all the world
[49:35] beginning at jerusalem hallelujah glory
[49:37] there you are he says what does calvary
[49:39] mean to you
[49:41] what did that day do to you
[49:43] what a good question
[49:45] did it stuff you out with some theology
[49:47] did it make you a stuffed shirt or did
[49:49] it make you a christian sold out i mean
[49:52] to ask the question what did that day do
[49:54] to you
[49:55] amen that day took my sins far away that
[49:58] they gave me the new birth that they may
[50:00] be a new creature in christ that they
[50:02] gave me the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:04] that's what it did for me
[50:06] hallelujah and it didn't make me a
[50:07] stuffed shirt i trust you can agree that
[50:09] this is from your own personal
[50:10] experience it did not make us stuffed
[50:12] shirts but it made us a christian sold
[50:14] out
[50:16] sold out to what his word
[50:18] to his leading no matter where it takes
[50:21] you
[50:22] amen a believer
[50:25] who who is totally surrendered to god
[50:28] does not put conditions on god when he
[50:31] comes to him or she comes to him
[50:33] so it's not like lord i'll give you my
[50:35] life if you give me a good life
[50:38] oh lord i'll serve you if you give me
[50:39] this job or if you give me this spouse
[50:41] no no that's not what it's about see
[50:43] that is an intellectual faith that's not
[50:45] sold out
[50:46] i mean sold out is willing to to be led
[50:50] wherever god will take you
[50:52] he may take you through heartache he may
[50:54] take you through disappointments he may
[50:56] take you through sickness he may take
[50:58] you through loss through hurt amen but
[51:00] you'll just go on rejoicing and
[51:03] conducting yourself in the trial like a
[51:05] child of god
[51:07] amen jesus would say to john's disciples
[51:10] john was in prison brother braham says
[51:11] like his eagle eyes were filmed over and
[51:13] he sends his disciples to to jesus
[51:15] saying are you the one or do we look for
[51:17] another now remember john saw the spirit
[51:19] of god descend upon jesus like a dove
[51:21] and that was the sign
[51:22] he says here's the lamb of god that
[51:23] takes away the sin of the world great
[51:25] things happen but he finds himself in a
[51:26] hard spot in prison because he does not
[51:28] expect his life to end up that way and i
[51:30] could guarantee a hundred percent of us
[51:32] would say when bad things happen i'd
[51:34] expect that to happen
[51:37] right but then jesus just told john's
[51:39] disciples when when that question and to
[51:41] me that was the greatest i think brother
[51:42] brown said it in this kind of way too it
[51:44] was like the worst question you could
[51:46] ever ask jesus are you really the one
[51:49] or do we look for another and then jesus
[51:51] did not seem to send john a couple of
[51:53] books on how to behave in prison he said
[51:55] to john's disciples just sit here and
[51:57] watch what happens and the sicker healed
[51:59] the dead erased the gospels preached to
[52:01] the poor many mighty signs and miracles
[52:04] are done and then so john and he says
[52:06] blessed is he who's not offended in me
[52:09] so he's saying to john basically if
[52:11] you're not offended you're blessed
[52:13] so if you're not offended where god
[52:15] takes you in life you're blessed
[52:17] amen because we all we we would always
[52:19] think there's just going to be a great
[52:20] power of overcoming and victory and
[52:23] stomping on every devil and you know hey
[52:25] we do get that in life right but there's
[52:27] pain and heartache and agonizing moments
[52:29] and hardship but blessing you if you're
[52:31] not offended at god in those things
[52:33] see we should never ever blame god for
[52:34] where we end up god it's your fault i'm
[52:37] annoyed at you i'm gonna i'm i'm not
[52:39] gonna talk to you for a while now i'm
[52:41] gonna give you the cold shoulder and you
[52:42] know we should never treat our god he's
[52:45] god
[52:46] he's he's not a man that's a flawed
[52:48] human being that has to grow and learn
[52:50] no no he knows all things he's the
[52:52] almighty he has no flaw in his character
[52:55] he cannot you know he doesn't he's not
[52:56] like me that can offend people just by
[52:58] how they don't do things or do things
[53:00] you know he's not that kind of a man
[53:03] he's god so we should never ever be
[53:05] offended where he takes us in life
[53:08] amen and i say real faith is not
[53:10] offended
[53:12] if you have divine faith
[53:15] reveal faith
[53:16] there should be no offense
[53:18] now that doesn't mean you don't feel
[53:20] pain and you don't feel heartache or
[53:22] disappointment or loss or sickness we're
[53:24] not exempt from those things we don't we
[53:26] have no free pass
[53:27] right everything that we face the world
[53:29] has two
[53:31] right but
[53:32] we should be so sold out
[53:35] lord if you're gonna take me through
[53:37] you're gonna take me through
[53:38] lord if this is today's schedule praise
[53:40] god
[53:41] if this is my decade schedule praise god
[53:45] how you doing
[53:46] he's leading me that's the thing that
[53:47] matters i'm not doing too well but he's
[53:49] doing real good
[53:50] amen he'll lead me through
[53:53] that's real
[53:54] uh faith
[53:56] amen
[53:58] now
[53:59] it could be easy i just put here this is
[54:00] not even the beginning but to begin with
[54:02] what faith is not
[54:04] real faith is not
[54:06] these things
[54:07] now he says here there's an expected
[54:10] expectancy faith knows no defeat faith
[54:13] is perfect faith brings things when
[54:15] there is no things to be brought faith
[54:17] creates faith takes doubt away takes
[54:19] negative makes positive how beautiful
[54:21] the old man has a basis for faith now
[54:24] listen this is what faith is not faith
[54:25] is not so mythical something mentally
[54:28] worked up it's an absolutely fundamental
[54:30] result that happens in a person's heart
[54:32] so it's not something that's worked out
[54:34] it's not something that's just imagined
[54:35] and this is how it's going to be and
[54:36] this is how the situation is going to
[54:38] pan out and this is how i want things to
[54:40] go that's not faith
[54:42] that's something that's mentally worked
[54:43] up he says look not because i'm standing
[54:46] here saying it but if you can understand
[54:48] how it is that faith is not something
[54:50] mentally perceived but it's a myth but
[54:53] it's a revelation a revelation of god by
[54:55] faith not intellectual but by his heart
[54:58] so it's not something that you mentally
[55:00] perceive remember this is not a
[55:01] university lecture hall glory
[55:04] hallelujah this is not inorganic
[55:06] chemistry 101
[55:08] oh
[55:09] calculus or whatever things i endured
[55:11] too much of
[55:13] you know
[55:14] this is not what this is about this is
[55:15] not sitting an exam to working out
[55:17] everything and then you're going to go
[55:18] on a rapture this is not this is not how
[55:21] faith works that is just mental
[55:23] understanding
[55:25] amen see faith is not what you feel
[55:28] faith is what you believe so it goes
[55:29] beyond feeling it goes beyond the five
[55:31] senses you know the prophet said that
[55:33] real faith is a sick sense
[55:35] i mean that you used to contact god with
[55:36] because you don't contact god with your
[55:38] eyes or with your even just your vocal
[55:40] cords or how you feel or taste smell all
[55:43] those things no it's by faith you touch
[55:45] god by
[55:46] amen you know faith is a subconscious
[55:48] thing
[55:50] it's not like oh i need faith for this
[55:51] right now no no no no it's subconscious
[55:54] you have it and don't realize see he
[55:56] says faith is a subconscious thing lady
[55:58] faith is not a mental act see it's
[56:00] something that you subconsciously do it
[56:02] people trying to look to their
[56:04] intellects for faith when faith doesn't
[56:06] lay their reasons lay their faith lays
[56:09] in the soul i say reasonings work
[56:12] against god
[56:14] unless they are
[56:15] you you can take your reasoning back to
[56:17] the scripture
[56:18] you know so i'm sick but your reasoning
[56:20] says buy stripes i'm healed or he's
[56:22] going to see me through this problem
[56:23] that's that's good reason but but
[56:25] reasoning of trying to work out how it's
[56:27] going to happen
[56:28] that that ain't going to help you
[56:30] but faith is subconscious it's not like
[56:33] oh there's a trouble now now i've got to
[56:34] try and get some faith no no you've
[56:36] already got it if you've got it
[56:38] amen
[56:40] now jesus was asked in luke 17 and verse
[56:42] 20 he was demanded of the pharisees when
[56:45] the kingdom of god should come he
[56:46] answered them and said the kingdom of
[56:48] god cometh not with observation neither
[56:50] shall they say lo here or there for
[56:52] behold the kingdom of god is within you
[56:56] so they wanted to they wanted something
[56:58] physical they could see you know when's
[57:00] the kingdom gonna come i want to know i
[57:02] need to know the facts all these things
[57:03] but he's saying it's not with
[57:05] observation so it's not something that
[57:07] you just read about that you can observe
[57:09] it's in front page i'll say this even
[57:11] front page news
[57:13] it's not with observation
[57:16] the kingdom he says the kingdom of god
[57:18] is within you so it's not something that
[57:19] can be
[57:20] that can be researched out mentally or
[57:22] or or seen with your eyes or your five
[57:25] senses it's not with observation you
[57:27] cannot observe this thing coming it's
[57:29] got to be within you what is the kingdom
[57:30] of god within you the baptism of the
[57:32] holy ghost that is within you so i say
[57:34] even now when the world is falling apart
[57:36] and russia is doing what it's prophesied
[57:38] to do no no you say well the rapture's
[57:40] close because that's happening no that's
[57:42] just the backdrop but the main character
[57:44] is on stages is actually you and god and
[57:47] god is wearing you talking to you making
[57:49] him making you more like him getting you
[57:52] into his image right because when the
[57:54] bride realizes what she is then the
[57:57] rapture will go when we realize we are
[57:59] the word made flesh today amen we are
[58:02] the revelation of god made manifest what
[58:04] we read on paper here shall be material
[58:06] in here hallelujah so it was once once
[58:09] on tape form it's now in bright form
[58:12] amen so that's how it should be right so
[58:14] you know we are actually the sign that
[58:16] the end uh world is falling apart
[58:18] because we're getting ready
[58:20] hallelujah
[58:21] i mean so the kingdom of god is within
[58:23] you it's not by observation it's not
[58:25] that you can search the right websites
[58:26] to find it no it's within you the holy
[58:28] ghost
[58:29] amen
[58:30] now faith is not denying symptoms
[58:34] it's not denying symptoms the three
[58:36] hebrew children do not deny now i'll
[58:38] hopefully come to them again and if not
[58:40] we'll be there on sunday but they did
[58:41] not deny that they were facing the
[58:43] furnace
[58:44] they did not deny or say no we're not
[58:46] we're not going nowhere near that
[58:48] furnace this is not how this is going to
[58:49] work out no they resigned their fate to
[58:52] god
[58:52] because that was real faith whatever
[58:54] happens we're not going to bow down
[58:57] if he delivers us praise the lord if not
[58:59] we're not we're not worshiping your
[59:00] image so whatever the outcome is of our
[59:03] walk he's in control
[59:05] and we're not going to sweat it out
[59:06] because he's in control
[59:08] amen so he says brother braham says and
[59:10] um how can i overcome he says you can't
[59:14] say i've got a sickness i don't believe
[59:16] it's a sickness he says oh yes it's a
[59:18] sickness
[59:19] you've got cancer you say i don't
[59:20] believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's
[59:22] a cancer some people say no no i don't
[59:24] have it.
[59:25] he's saying don't do that he says but
[59:27] remember greater is he that is in you
[59:29] that's he that's in the world you must
[59:31] realize that the holy spirit that's in
[59:33] you has already overcome this thing and
[59:35] he is in you and you can overcome by him
[59:37] he says that's exactly sensible it's
[59:40] exactly the way the scripture's written
[59:42] overcoming she can't say i don't have it
[59:44] no no you've got it right but you know
[59:47] sometimes you know i believe in medical
[59:49] science
[59:50] right and we'll go into how god answers
[59:52] in different avenues but sometimes it
[59:54] can be just be good to go to the doctor
[59:56] to find out the devil's name that you're
[59:58] fighting
[1:00:00] sometimes it's just a good oh now i know
[1:00:02] what it is i can call it out
[1:00:04] now you say well i but even in saying
[1:00:06] that you say you can't get a diagnosis
[1:00:08] just know no devil can hide from god
[1:00:11] amen
[1:00:12] so it's exactly sensible to recognize
[1:00:15] the enemy and then realize the one that
[1:00:17] that is in you has already overcome that
[1:00:19] enemy
[1:00:20] doesn't matter what form or shape or
[1:00:22] size it may be and now some people just
[1:00:24] want to go to the quote and we're going
[1:00:25] to go into it where brother ram says
[1:00:27] don't don't sign for the devil's parcel
[1:00:29] and they take it out of context they
[1:00:31] think that's basically just flat denying
[1:00:32] it's there but let's just read this
[1:00:35] he says he says symptoms is something
[1:00:37] like say tomorrow when you go home now
[1:00:39] to your place the express agent will
[1:00:41] come and say hey mrs doe or you say the
[1:00:43] courier comes that's the express agent
[1:00:45] are you mrs doe you say yes i have a
[1:00:47] present for you all right what is it
[1:00:48] hands over a basket or a box yeah
[1:00:51] something hitting in that box you look
[1:00:52] it's a big box of snakes rattlesnakes
[1:00:55] well you don't want them things well you
[1:00:57] say i don't want them oh but they're
[1:00:58] yours somebody sent them to you here's
[1:01:00] your name here's the name it's somebody
[1:01:02] sent these snakes to it's yours you have
[1:01:04] to have them now
[1:01:06] in one sense of the world word they're
[1:01:08] yours in the other sense they're not
[1:01:10] somebody sent them to you but they're
[1:01:13] not but they're not yours until you sign
[1:01:16] for them that you've received them now
[1:01:18] i'm going to go on to that and when you
[1:01:20] sign you've received them then they're
[1:01:21] yours but if you refuse to sign for them
[1:01:24] he has to take them back to the express
[1:01:25] company the express company has to send
[1:01:27] them to the one that sent it to you is
[1:01:30] that right well don't sign for nothing
[1:01:31] the devil brought no sir just refuse to
[1:01:34] have it no sir say i haven't got it
[1:01:36] devil you'll take it all back that's all
[1:01:38] i won't have it refuse to have your
[1:01:40] sickness your arthritis whatever it is i
[1:01:42] haven't got it by his stripes i'm healed
[1:01:44] stand right on your ground confess it
[1:01:46] believe it stay there god will bring it
[1:01:48] to pass no matter what it is just
[1:01:50] believe him what's he basically saying
[1:01:52] he doesn't say deny it's on your porch
[1:01:55] or just turn a blind eye to it don't
[1:01:57] receive it
[1:01:58] when you receive something it becomes
[1:02:00] part of you
[1:02:01] right when you receive something it
[1:02:03] becomes part of you so now two to stand
[1:02:07] there and refuse it sure you've got the
[1:02:09] symptoms but you're not accepting it
[1:02:11] it's not part of you you haven't
[1:02:12] received it though it's on your porch
[1:02:14] and you can hear the snakes rattling
[1:02:15] around in the box and it's in your house
[1:02:18] that's there but you don't accept it you
[1:02:20] want it out
[1:02:21] right see
[1:02:23] it's very you know it becomes part of
[1:02:25] you if you accept it so when it comes to
[1:02:27] sickness don't ever say it's yours
[1:02:30] or you've got a real heavy depressive
[1:02:32] spirit on you don't say it's your
[1:02:33] depression
[1:02:34] i mean never say it's your cancer or
[1:02:36] your diabetes or your high blood
[1:02:38] pressure or your vertigo what is that
[1:02:40] that's receiving the snakes
[1:02:42] right but if you say this is not mine i
[1:02:44] don't want it it doesn't belong to me
[1:02:46] then god i believe will take it away
[1:02:47] from you in his time
[1:02:49] amen is that is that in balance i think
[1:02:51] you know because we can't deny if you've
[1:02:52] got something you can't just deny and
[1:02:54] say it's not there
[1:02:56] right now the prophet said you've got to
[1:02:57] recognize it's there but recognize the
[1:02:59] one in you has already overcome it
[1:03:01] and you don't receive it
[1:03:03] right you send it back stomp on box
[1:03:05] return to sender hallelujah
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:09] now
[1:03:11] he says in jehovah gyra
[1:03:13] i've seen so many times that people say
[1:03:15] well i've got it all figured out i've
[1:03:17] got to understand it then it isn't faith
[1:03:19] anymore faith is not what you understand
[1:03:21] faith is what you accept and can't
[1:03:23] explain it's an act of faith
[1:03:25] he says faith is not a myth
[1:03:27] neither is it something you just imagine
[1:03:30] faith is positive faith is a substance
[1:03:32] just the same as this glasses or the
[1:03:34] same as this book is
[1:03:36] now
[1:03:37] real faith will speak
[1:03:40] when david faced goliath
[1:03:42] it wasn't him and his humanity speaking
[1:03:45] the outcome
[1:03:46] it wasn't him deciding i'm going to kill
[1:03:48] you
[1:03:49] it wasn't him just mentally
[1:03:51] see it wasn't a power of just a positive
[1:03:54] confession that we mentally say this is
[1:03:55] how it's going to end up
[1:03:57] he did not he did not in his own
[1:04:00] mind say i'm going to cut your head off
[1:04:02] and then i'm going to kill all these
[1:04:03] philistines too i'm going to feed them
[1:04:04] all to the birds that wasn't him
[1:04:06] speaking the outcome in his humanity
[1:04:08] that was god taking his lips and
[1:04:10] prophesying the enemy's doom
[1:04:13] amen there's a big difference between me
[1:04:15] saying well this is how this is going to
[1:04:16] work out and god's saying this is how
[1:04:18] it's going to work out and and really
[1:04:20] it's when the holy ghost gets a hold of
[1:04:22] you and speaks the outcome that's when
[1:04:23] god's going to do it but we can sign our
[1:04:25] mind well this is i believe this is
[1:04:27] going to happen it could just be hope it
[1:04:28] could just be i i think so i'm you know
[1:04:31] this is how i think it's going to work
[1:04:32] out that's not speaking your outcome
[1:04:34] that's just you hoping it's going to
[1:04:35] happen but when god speaks it it's very
[1:04:38] different thing because we know the end
[1:04:39] of the story with david he killed
[1:04:41] goliath he used goliath sword to chop
[1:04:43] his head off
[1:04:44] and and the rest of israel the only
[1:04:46] reason david didn't go kill them all is
[1:04:48] because the army of israel chased after
[1:04:50] the philistines
[1:04:51] hallelujah but you go read the account
[1:04:53] he says i'm going to kill you and all
[1:04:54] your buddies behind you i'm going to
[1:04:55] wipe you all out and he had five stones
[1:04:58] in his in his script bag because goliath
[1:05:00] had brothers and relatives other giants
[1:05:02] he just killed them all
[1:05:04] but that was god speaking through him
[1:05:06] the outcome
[1:05:07] amen it's exactly the same when brother
[1:05:09] tim pruitt a few years ago his wife's
[1:05:10] sister karen had the first brain bleed
[1:05:13] and they were there in the icu he had
[1:05:15] the family there and he said no no we
[1:05:16] believe we believe god can do it because
[1:05:19] that's what believers do we believe the
[1:05:20] word of god and he said that she'll be
[1:05:22] in icu that night she'll be in a normal
[1:05:25] ward the next night and the third night
[1:05:26] she'll be back at home and that's
[1:05:28] exactly what happened why because god
[1:05:30] took his lips and spoke the outcome it
[1:05:32] wasn't him in his mind saying this is
[1:05:34] going to happen it was god speaking the
[1:05:35] outcome through him and it happened
[1:05:37] exactly that way
[1:05:38] amen so we're going to let the lord do
[1:05:40] that kind of thing
[1:05:42] when faith speaks that revelation begins
[1:05:44] to speak it's not you speaking it's god
[1:05:46] speaking through you i mean you see the
[1:05:48] reason david could do that is because it
[1:05:50] was revealed to him
[1:05:52] that it could be done
[1:05:53] it wasn't just a faith
[1:05:56] or or they knew uh he knew it could be
[1:05:59] done i'll just read the quote he says
[1:06:00] here now a little david's standing there
[1:06:02] little piece of leather goat skin or
[1:06:03] sheepskin with two strings piece of
[1:06:05] string tied to it but it was revealed to
[1:06:07] him revelation struck him amen he said
[1:06:11] the god that took me out the pores of
[1:06:12] the bear took me out of the pores of the
[1:06:14] lion how much more will he deliver that
[1:06:16] uncircumcised philistine into my hand
[1:06:18] his brothers were more than able to do
[1:06:20] it saul head and shoulders above his
[1:06:22] army but you see it wasn't revealed to
[1:06:24] them amen there it was they believed it
[1:06:27] could be done and that faith was just
[1:06:29] human faith intellectual faith they
[1:06:31] believe that god could do it but it
[1:06:33] wasn't revealed to them but it was
[1:06:36] revealed to david see now there's a
[1:06:38] difference right there if it's
[1:06:39] absolutely revealed to you that god is
[1:06:41] going to heal you you're going to get it
[1:06:44] you're going to get it i don't care
[1:06:46] what's wrong with you what's the odds
[1:06:47] that may be worse than david and goliath
[1:06:49] but if it's revealed to you and notice
[1:06:51] when it's revealed david became fearless
[1:06:54] he says today i'll cut your head off
[1:06:56] amen that's our god by grace and that
[1:06:58] crucial moment when decisions had to be
[1:07:00] made that same god that produced the
[1:07:02] grace in that day and dropped that seed
[1:07:04] of faith in that little hunchback
[1:07:06] looking boy being in his heart that same
[1:07:08] god and this crucial moment could take
[1:07:10] that woman from that wheelchair that man
[1:07:12] this woman here that child that little
[1:07:14] grain of faith is revealed to you he
[1:07:16] says then i don't care how long it takes
[1:07:19] because it's revealed it's not a hope or
[1:07:21] an intellectual faith it's revealed
[1:07:23] faith
[1:07:24] amen you see his brothers
[1:07:26] when he first turned up to the battle
[1:07:28] one of his brothers said you're just
[1:07:29] naughty you've just come out here to
[1:07:31] watch the battle you're being naughty
[1:07:33] and they just thought it was just
[1:07:35] bravado
[1:07:36] but it wasn't bravado speaking it was
[1:07:38] revelation speaking
[1:07:40] when he was speaking to goliath and
[1:07:41] saying who why doesn't someone go face
[1:07:43] this guy he's uncircumcised philistine
[1:07:45] who's this one who defies the army he's
[1:07:46] a living god they thought you're just
[1:07:48] being a naughty boy go back to your
[1:07:50] sheep go back to father's house but it
[1:07:52] wasn't bravado it was revelation
[1:07:54] speaking now today the girls had their
[1:07:56] cross country at school
[1:07:58] and we saw especially with the boys
[1:07:59] running a lot of bravado they would
[1:08:01] start sprinting and they and they went
[1:08:04] round the field then they went off you
[1:08:05] know went off somewhere came back the
[1:08:07] other side of the school those ones
[1:08:08] sprinting weren't even at the front at
[1:08:10] all when when when the finishing line
[1:08:12] was coming it was all bravado but they
[1:08:15] didn't have what they needed to finish
[1:08:16] the race
[1:08:18] you see it was all in the head it wasn't
[1:08:19] in the heart but those who had more than
[1:08:21] bravado but they knew i could win i can
[1:08:23] run this race i can do it i don't need
[1:08:25] to stop they were the ones who ran all
[1:08:28] the way and they won the race
[1:08:30] it means it's got to be the same thing
[1:08:31] with us it can start with brava yo it
[1:08:33] can appear see bravado is just trying to
[1:08:36] show off to see who can win it's the
[1:08:38] same thing with intellectual faith it
[1:08:40] may appear good at the beginning but it
[1:08:42] doesn't last the distance
[1:08:44] amy but so intellectual faith is what
[1:08:46] but the thing is intellectual faith is
[1:08:48] what we start with
[1:08:49] but don't stay with it because it will
[1:08:51] fail see what if that bravado was
[1:08:53] actually
[1:08:54] real stamina to run they would have won
[1:08:57] but they started sprinting and then when
[1:08:58] the
[1:08:59] you know going got hard they just quit
[1:09:02] i don't believe we've start
[1:09:04] when we're not on the christian journey
[1:09:06] like that
[1:09:07] amen it's actually when we need that
[1:09:10] faith it actually comes to the forefront
[1:09:12] it's not just provided not just an
[1:09:13] intellectual faith now intellectual
[1:09:16] faith
[1:09:17] is not enough
[1:09:18] it will bring you to the holy ghost the
[1:09:21] prophet says he says earnestly
[1:09:23] contending for the faith he says now he
[1:09:25] says he says you get the intellect um he
[1:09:28] says paul was down there in the natural
[1:09:30] realm with his phd he didn't know he had
[1:09:33] an intellectual faith but he didn't have
[1:09:34] a divine faith it's quite a difference
[1:09:37] in me having an intellectual faith in a
[1:09:39] divine faith that's where you my baptist
[1:09:42] friends fail to go on you get the
[1:09:43] intellectual faith by that but it must
[1:09:46] be a divine revelation of jesus christ
[1:09:48] you that takes sin out of the heart
[1:09:50] intellectual faith is not enough it's
[1:09:52] all right but it only brings you to the
[1:09:54] holy spirit so an intellectual faith
[1:09:57] will reveal to you that you're a sinner
[1:09:59] an ethical intellectual faith will
[1:10:01] reveal to you there's more to life than
[1:10:02] what you see that there's a world after
[1:10:05] there's somewhere where you're going to
[1:10:06] go intellectual faith faith will show
[1:10:08] you that jesus died on calvary to make
[1:10:11] an atonement for you that you can go to
[1:10:12] heaven
[1:10:13] it will just bring you to it but don't
[1:10:15] just stay there you've got to go from
[1:10:17] intellectual faith into a real holy
[1:10:20] ghost personal experience that'll give
[1:10:22] you a genuine new birth and will give
[1:10:24] you divine revelation
[1:10:27] amen will make you a new creature in
[1:10:30] christ
[1:10:31] hallelujah there's seat that's where the
[1:10:33] difference comes see we start off all
[1:10:35] start off with intellectual faith but
[1:10:36] don't stop there see some people stop
[1:10:38] there because they say well the great
[1:10:40] mystery in the end time was the holy
[1:10:42] ghost you're the baptism of the holy
[1:10:44] ghost without sensation but they just
[1:10:46] leave half the quote because the rest of
[1:10:47] the quotas but the works of christ did
[1:10:49] you like you did before
[1:10:50] hallelujah so but some people just say
[1:10:52] well oh our sensation nothing happened
[1:10:54] but praise the lord i must have it it
[1:10:55] can just be intellectual faith
[1:10:58] that's why you've got to be able to say
[1:11:00] no i really met him he changed my life
[1:11:02] what i once was i'm no longer that
[1:11:04] person it may happen very different ways
[1:11:06] to different people we've got to say
[1:11:08] there's been a change in me
[1:11:09] since i really met him
[1:11:12] amen now faith
[1:11:14] faith is knowing the lord is completely
[1:11:15] in control and fully trusting in him and
[1:11:17] being willing to accept however he wants
[1:11:19] to answer
[1:11:21] now now i'll just read this so
[1:11:23] he says faith finds a source that other
[1:11:25] people don't know nothing about just
[1:11:27] like the ones who won the cross country
[1:11:28] today
[1:11:29] or kept running the whole race i'll put
[1:11:31] it that way when a man has got faith in
[1:11:32] god he's got a hold of something that he
[1:11:35] can't explain it it's something he's got
[1:11:37] a hold of he cannot push it or shove it
[1:11:40] or pull it it takes him that's the way
[1:11:42] faith is when a man really has got faith
[1:11:44] in god it finds that source that others
[1:11:46] don't see i mean so real faith you can't
[1:11:48] push you can't shove you can't pull so
[1:11:51] you can't push it to happen you can't
[1:11:53] pull it to happen you can't shove it say
[1:11:54] god make this promise happen you can't
[1:11:57] even though we call out that way but but
[1:11:59] you can't shove it you can't push it you
[1:12:01] can't pull it it takes you
[1:12:03] your faith takes you to the promise
[1:12:05] hell it's not you you're humanly trying
[1:12:07] to work it out your faith will take you
[1:12:09] to the promise
[1:12:10] amen it takes you hallelujah
[1:12:13] now
[1:12:13] god is not a cookie cutter
[1:12:16] he doesn't answer the same time every
[1:12:17] way you can see in david's life he
[1:12:20] killed the lion and the bear and goliath
[1:12:21] with the slingshot he never used it
[1:12:22] after that
[1:12:24] right sometimes god told him go attack
[1:12:26] them other times he's waiting and
[1:12:28] praying and god says no don't go yet but
[1:12:29] go this way or when you hear the sound
[1:12:31] of it going through the mulberry trees
[1:12:33] you know so god is not a cookie cutter
[1:12:36] but we need to be surrendered
[1:12:39] to however he wants to answer us
[1:12:41] see the hebrew children did not have
[1:12:43] their preconceived idea of how it's
[1:12:45] going to work out
[1:12:47] they had real faith they did not speak
[1:12:49] their outcomes saying we're not going to
[1:12:50] go anywhere near the furnace and all
[1:12:52] those things they just went they knew
[1:12:54] god was able to deliver if not well
[1:12:56] they're not going to bow
[1:12:58] so now
[1:12:59] so we must real faith is willing to be
[1:13:02] led to however the answer comes
[1:13:04] you know there's um we know that there's
[1:13:06] the four
[1:13:07] four living creatures around the throne
[1:13:09] the four cherubims right as the holy
[1:13:11] ghost and different me uh different
[1:13:13] dispensations or however you want to put
[1:13:15] it down through the ages so the first
[1:13:16] anointing has had a face like a like a
[1:13:19] lion
[1:13:20] and sometimes god will just heal in a
[1:13:22] miracle like this supernatural just just
[1:13:24] like that something can happen right
[1:13:26] sometimes he'll answer that way i'll
[1:13:28] leave the ox till last
[1:13:30] but but then sometimes it can be through
[1:13:32] the face of a man which is man's
[1:13:34] understanding like medicine or a change
[1:13:36] in diet or you're getting enough sleep
[1:13:39] and god can heal you that way see lord i
[1:13:41] need i need help with this ailment in my
[1:13:43] body you know show me know touch my life
[1:13:46] change me then someone comes along and
[1:13:47] says how's your diet
[1:13:50] are you getting enough sleep
[1:13:52] you know are you you know how's your
[1:13:54] how's your quiet time you know
[1:13:56] and and you find that that's gone
[1:13:58] that's how the lord answered but if
[1:14:00] you're just looking for a bolt from the
[1:14:01] blue you'll miss the answer
[1:14:03] right
[1:14:04] um and then there's also divine healing
[1:14:06] and ego anointing lay hands upon the
[1:14:08] sick and they shall recover it's
[1:14:10] different to a miracle but it's still
[1:14:11] divine healer it's still god right
[1:14:13] there's a difference between an instant
[1:14:14] miracle and a divine healing divine
[1:14:16] healing can take a process of time lay
[1:14:18] hands upon the sick and they shall
[1:14:20] recover
[1:14:21] he doesn't give a specification of the
[1:14:22] time
[1:14:23] but then there's also the ox anointing
[1:14:26] which he had to carry unto death
[1:14:29] but are we willing to be led whoever god
[1:14:31] wants us to take it remember sickness is
[1:14:34] not a sign of unbelief
[1:14:37] trouble is not a sign that your faith is
[1:14:39] dropped
[1:14:40] remember faith is not some kind of force
[1:14:42] field that keeps all trouble away no
[1:14:45] faith gives you overcoming power to go
[1:14:47] through the trial conduct yourself like
[1:14:48] a believer that's what real revelation
[1:14:50] faith does
[1:14:52] amen so we've got to be willing
[1:14:55] however god will lead us
[1:14:57] through every trial are we are we
[1:14:59] surrendered to it like the hebrew
[1:15:01] children they didn't make up their mind
[1:15:03] this is going to happen they say well
[1:15:04] god can do it if not we're still not
[1:15:06] bowing so we're still going to die in
[1:15:08] the faith
[1:15:09] we're going to die believing and and and
[1:15:11] if they went into the furnace got burnt
[1:15:12] up would it be any more of a
[1:15:14] supernatural thing would it be less
[1:15:17] it'll be the same
[1:15:18] because everyone else bowed but their
[1:15:20] faith
[1:15:20] overcome in the pressure
[1:15:22] i mean otherwise you look at you know
[1:15:25] you can take examples and i'll just give
[1:15:26] this real quick then we'll then then
[1:15:28] we'll push pause and continue on sunday
[1:15:30] but you see peter peter was in prison in
[1:15:32] the book of acts and he was going to get
[1:15:34] beheaded and he got delivered
[1:15:36] james got beheaded some people say well
[1:15:39] james had less faith than peter no
[1:15:41] james finished his course ran his race
[1:15:43] and god said i'm taking you home now
[1:15:45] peter did not get beheaded because his
[1:15:47] course wasn't finished
[1:15:49] amen
[1:15:50] you take daniel the lion's den the lions
[1:15:52] didn't need him
[1:15:53] but then you take the martyrs you know
[1:15:56] you know who are feet to the lions which
[1:15:57] one had more faith well they both had
[1:16:00] faith
[1:16:01] god wasn't finished with daniel
[1:16:03] and god was finished with them on this
[1:16:04] earth he wanted to take them home
[1:16:06] but he's saying daniel i'm not taking
[1:16:08] you home yet you're actually gonna you
[1:16:09] have to live out a bit longer then i'll
[1:16:11] take you home
[1:16:12] see it's however avenue god will take
[1:16:14] our life we've got to be remember real
[1:16:15] christians sold out
[1:16:18] and that's why you can't compare your
[1:16:20] life with someone else's because some
[1:16:22] people just seem to tiptoe around
[1:16:24] trouble and some of us just wade through
[1:16:26] it
[1:16:26] you know but
[1:16:28] who's got the more faith
[1:16:30] see all that no no they both have the
[1:16:33] same revelation
[1:16:34] some through the fire some through the
[1:16:36] flood you know but all through the blood
[1:16:39] but it but it's all it's all god has pre
[1:16:42] conde you know he has predetermined our
[1:16:45] our walk
[1:16:46] and if you go through a trial the
[1:16:48] prophet says actually he's counted
[1:16:49] you're worthy to go through it
[1:16:52] so we can rejoice and say lord thank you
[1:16:55] but intellectual faith we'll just look
[1:16:57] at the here and now and say this ain't
[1:16:58] fair
[1:17:00] but real faith looks beyond the now
[1:17:02] and looks to the prize
[1:17:04] say lord jesus you're in this with me
[1:17:07] you didn't lead me here to leave me here
[1:17:08] you're going to lead me all the way
[1:17:10] through
[1:17:11] amen so
[1:17:13] real faith is a revelation it's revealed
[1:17:16] to you it's a substance of things
[1:17:17] hopeful the evidence of things unseen
[1:17:20] it anchors into your heart and you know
[1:17:22] it's going to happen
[1:17:23] you don't know how but you know god's
[1:17:25] going to do it
[1:17:26] it's not something you work up pump up
[1:17:28] push pull whatever no god just drops it
[1:17:30] in
[1:17:31] changes your whole life and you go on
[1:17:33] rejoicing saying thank you lord
[1:17:35] the answer's on the road
[1:17:38] amen we're gonna we're gonna push pause
[1:17:41] right there and we'll continue on sunday
[1:17:43] but aren't you glad for real faith
[1:17:46] it's more than this when this fails it's
[1:17:49] in you know it's in here you know
[1:17:51] there's some some christian
[1:17:52] denominations they they say well if you
[1:17:54] get alzheimer's you're lost because you
[1:17:56] can't think of god anymore god's greater
[1:17:58] than his mental faculties
[1:18:00] you know someone can be full up with
[1:18:02] with dementia all kinds of things but
[1:18:04] their soul is sealed into the kingdom
[1:18:06] what happens to this body is actually it
[1:18:08] doesn't matter when it comes to
[1:18:10] salvation if you're sealed to the day of
[1:18:12] your redemption you can lose your mind
[1:18:14] you're still going
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] you say well would the lord allow that
[1:18:19] to happen he allowed a lot of things to
[1:18:21] happen to a lot of people
[1:18:23] it didn't mean god was remember brother
[1:18:24] brahm says that sunny days is not a sign
[1:18:26] of god's
[1:18:28] pleasure or rainy days a sign of his
[1:18:30] displeasure in your life
[1:18:33] that doesn't even come to the equation
[1:18:34] he loves you he died on calvary for you
[1:18:37] his love doesn't change your love of god
[1:18:39] how rich and pure how measureless and
[1:18:41] strong it's not conditional like our
[1:18:43] level doesn't fluctuate like the stock
[1:18:45] market or the currency it doesn't go up
[1:18:47] and down because of market forces
[1:18:50] it stays constant
[1:18:51] and you're glad he doesn't change his
[1:18:53] mind about you
[1:18:54] at your worst he loves you at your best
[1:18:56] he loves you all the same
[1:18:58] and your down times and your broken
[1:19:00] times you can be upside down don't know
[1:19:02] which way you're going you can be
[1:19:03] walking in totally the wrong direction
[1:19:05] he still loves you and his love will
[1:19:07] just pull you back on the road
