your way in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen hallelujah god bless you saints it's good to be here in the house of the lord tonight hallelujah amen thank you musicians amen give the lord a hand clear for praise amen hallelujah hey man i don't know who said it at the convention but they were like these are this is for clapping i think it was brother cooper and he's like you know give god praise he gave us hands to praise him amen hallelujah whether your hands are lifted up and surrender and and you know really uh yielding and or you're praising god clapping you know i believe that he inhabits those things amen hallelujah so i'm just really honored to be standing here before you once again it is a great honor and privilege and i'm very thankful hallelujah amen while you're standing if we could turn in our bibles to luke please um and i'll have my slideshow so um we're going to go through now you know i kind of wrestled again oh man this is not my usual style but well you know the lord just leads us and this is where he's led me so we just obey the lord amen who thinks it's good to obey the lord amen it's really good to listen to the spirit of god because sometimes you don't understand why but the lord knows and so amen hallelujah the last time i've done this type of thing was when about eight years ago or something when i did the subconscious series so hey man i've got a it's it's probably like a three-part series that will happen over whenever i'm back in in here doing it if the lord wills so we'll just see how this goes amen so let's um i just ask for your undivided attention and for you to be focused because there's it's basically going to be a lot of reading but there's lots of pictures as well so we can have a bit of a visual as well as a audible amen who's excited to hear from the lord tonight amen hallelujah um oh yeah i'll do this so we're going to speak on the subject called the two trees and part one is called the overview of both trees from eternity to time hallelujah so let's read from luke chapter 6 verses 43 to 45 and it says here say amen if you're there amen hallelujah we're just family amen hallelujah hallelujah there's no need to be nervous hallelujah for a good tree bringeth forth not oh sorry sorry for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for every tree is known by his fruit may the lord bless his word you may be seated hallelujah right hallelujah so we're speaking of the two trees and the two trees obviously everyone knows what the two trees are the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen and everything comes back to those two trees everything the every inspiration anything you've ever thought anything you've ever done anything you've ever believed or ever partaken of is rooted in either these two trees and you know the trees are symbolic poetic they're they're they're not literal trees but the idea of the tree is used because of its nature and it's the way it works and it's a metaphor who knows what a metaphor is hey man when do you start learning that like standard four form one everyone's like what's that there's only a few of us in here now year seven year eight it's probably when you start learning about that eh hey man so anyway my why is a tree used to depict the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life and here the reason is is because of the parts of the tree you've got now you've got it you've got this organism that's rooted in the ground and you've got now um the process of this tree is that there is life in the tree right so where where that's rooted in is the inspiration to that tree and so the the what's the the the life is in the tree and it comes out and it comes out into the fruit right and the tree is known by its fruit so the tree of life the fruit of the tree of life would be love joy peace long suffering and these are the fruits of the spirit of god so what's the sap in that tree the holy ghost exactly the holy ghost is the sap in the tree of life so what's the sap in the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's the unholy ghost it's the unholy ghost it's unholy inspiration it's the inspiration of satan it's it's a corruption of truth so you have perfect truth perfect realization and then you have a corruption of that whether it's corrupt by one word or everything it's still a corruption and it's the roots of that so what you have here now as jesus said a tree is known by its fruit is this tree if this was the tree of life there would be love joy peace long suffering and the fruit of christ that would be the sweet stuff on the outside of the fruit there's love joy peace long suffering but inside there is a seed and that seed has got life inside it and that seed will produce another christian if it's you are you on the tree of life right now remember today is going to be an overview so i'm not going to go too deep into anything but then the next service will be about the fruit of the tree of life and then it's going to be about the fruit of the tree of knowledge after the service after that and then that's about it amen oh there is another one which will go into the destruction of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and you'll see man it's such a subject that's such a subject hallelujah um amen so we have here now if this was the tree of life it would have the seed in there and you use jesus says now but first before i go to the next slide i want you to see that if this was the tree of knowledge these would be different fruit they wouldn't be the fruit of the spirit and the fruit of and they wouldn't have the seed in them they will have a seed but it won't have any life in it you know that does anyone know that if you hybridize something you take god's creation god's creation you mix it up the life is gone it doesn't have the same life it's not original anymore that's why it's called the tree of knowledge of good and evil because satan and we'll get into this but satan had a plan and his plan was he thought was better than the plan of god's god has this idea of a perfect civilization of love joy and an economy that works and the spoken word and creation and supernatural and satan thought no no that's not good enough and satan thought he had a better idea okay so satan in doing that because you can imagine in heaven it's perfect and there's truth and there's the righteousness of god the economy of god the plan of god to have a family and to do all these things which he would have been revealing and that lucifer was like nah nah nah come and follow me a good portion of the angels he took them and he rose himself above them and he said and he went up to the kingdom of the north it said and he said this is my plan and he begin to lay out another plan and lo and behold you're in the middle of it you are in the middle of his plan out there but thankfully god has grace to say i'm not going to allow you to be of that i'm going to rescue you out of that civilization out of that plan i'm going to take you and put you in back on the tree of life it's a different economy it's a different sap it's it's not the sap of of satan or some corruption it's the sap of the holy ghost and when you're abiding on that vine then you become a branch right we all know this this is very elementary stuff but i think it's quite cool to um just go over it again amen so satan rose up above that and he decided to have a civilization and this is the civilization you see out there monetary systems all of the education system learning effort law rules all of that this whole control and and like this whole effort of man and to preserve the ideas of man and to lift up men above men there's a whole system of control that's a lack of the holy ghost and that's the reason why it doesn't work that's the reason why no matter what you do at the tree of knowledge you can give all your faith to it and you can believe in it and you can become a phd scientist and push evolution and push these things and and it will take you nowhere other than having maybe a better income and a bit of prestige in the world and it will just it won't actually get you anywhere and actually the prophet says that you get only to a certain point and then you fall backwards you know that yeah he says it quite a few times it's not just like a fig like he said it once he said it quite a few times i don't quite understand exactly what he means by fall backwards but it is fairly self-explanatory that you can't go any further and when you get to the top it's like you spring back and you don't know what to do and a lot of scientists they end up either becoming agnostic or they you know they just whatever they do they don't go any further but the tree of life now the prophet says when you get to the end of the tree of knowledge now jump over onto the tree of life and you'll just it's he says he's you've got untapped potential untapped oh my there's power love untapped you know the joy of the lord is untapped hallelujah there's so much currents and rivers of god hallelujah brother brown says this he says like i was preaching the other night on the blood offering blood sacrifice babylon is spoke of in genesis the first of the bible babylon spoke of in the middle of the bible babylon spoke of in the last of the bible it starts in genesis comes over to revelations everything begins them two spirits so he's lying everything back to these two spirits and all that stuff that you see in the civilizations and everything that comes under the babylonian umbrella is all everything that's all of that just comes back to the spirit of the devil and then there's god's spirit so we're going to start with the tree of life and jesus says i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every brunch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and iron you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches it's very clear who's the tree of life right but i'm going to go through quite a few different scriptures to show you exactly how he portrays himself poetically and directly as the tree of life and he's saying that you're the branches and he says if my abide in me and i and you what is that this holy spirit that has been made away for us to come and live in us to abide in you you will become fruitful but you need to believe that he is that vine and you need to believe his promises now this isn't rocket science this isn't some complicated thing you just need to have no fear and believe the promises of god and nothing is impossible nothing is impossible you look down the barrel of so many impossible situations but none of them are actually impossible the problem is is fear fear of the unknown fear that the devil because you know they weren't going to just give it to you like he's not going to stop attacking you he's not going to just let you have something without giving the resistance so he's going to put unbelief on you he's going to try and make you disbelieve things he's going to work against the promises of god but if you just believe in the simplicity of it like a child to their father and say i believe it and i'm going to walk in that and you begin to walk in that and believe the promises of god and you believe that he's divine in that you because it's only faith in him that connects you to the tree of life there's no other way to do it faith in him as the tree of life because adam wasn't allowed anymore but now you are you're allowed access back to the tree of life and the tree of life has come in such a way that it'll wrap you out of here so the promises every promise is that if there was ever anything reserved back it's not anymore it's all there and every fruit every promise every inheritance everything has been promised you just believe it and you become a branch you know you just you just a branch you don't have to produce anything you just yield and believe and you're just this faithful branch on the edge of the vine and he's just fruiting through oh my you don't have to do anything other than believe hallelujah i'm not go i will never get through it if i preach i just want to go through it so john 1 1 he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him in him was life amen and the life was the light of men hallelujah colossians 1 15 it says who is the in the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him jesus christ the son of god amen all things consist all things are held together you are held together he holds you together would you just believe just believe you know we try and figure ourselves out we try and work everything out we try all these programs and diets and everything to try and just believe hallelujah just believe oh my it works it's proven who believes it's proven tonight it's a proven reality that believing and having faith in jesus christ works hallelujah now be careful who you put your faith in you know who you believing in because you can believe in jesus but then you your actions are actually showing that you've got you're believing in the tree of knowledge and you begin to adhere to scientific opinion and you let that discourage you you let what the doctor tells you about your health discourage you but the tree of life is different now listen to your doctor if he's telling you to do something don't just be radical you know you want to be led by the spirit of god but just remember the the reality of the word is he has done it and there is nothing impossible if you just believe hallelujah and there is a tree of knowledge that we lean on i don't want you to to throw you into a complete you don't need to do that either you know that you don't need to completely divorce yourself from the society and become a monk in the monastery uh to to only have the tree of life you know um god will put you there we will get there we will actually end up 100 reliant on the tree of life before the end because god will uh the devil is not going to allow us to even buy anything in the society we will be so ostracized so repudiated but just remember repudiation who knows what repudiation means repudiation is the rejection and the the absolute renouncing of the truth or of something and you know that's what they did when they crucified christ and when the word came in the opening of the seals and brother branham's message came they repudiated it they hated on it they pushed it out they defamed it and they crucified the word but what happened it released the power of christ upon the bride in secret and it became this this private ministry between you and him because it's not a public show it's not this big fancy thing that's on these big arenas and in stadiums and all of that it's a secret mystery between individual and god you know and that's exactly what he wants to do that's what he wants to do to you tonight that's what he wants you to have tonight amen and he showed revelation 2 1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life amen which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit hello tree of life branches amen every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations in john 6 53 it says here then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last days for my flesh is meat indeed and oh mate where am i there we are and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat man he's talking to the jewish people you know and they're referring back to these things in their mind he's saying no this is different now and it did but he that eateth of this bread shall live forever the very thing that adam lost access to that would enable him to live forever was now being revealed back to the people and jesus is saying eat me eat my word partake of it and the word eat in the scripture means to devour hallelujah who's hungry are you hungry amen eat the word amen don't just touch the word amen don't flirt with the word eat the word that means to become one with it and put all your faith and trust in it and then you become a branch and then you then you're now connected to the tree of life and has sat now comes through you and produces fruit but the same thing can happen on the other side if you put your trust and you know this is where and we're going to read it but there's any when you whatever you do in the tree of knowledge and whether it's jobs whether it's needed whether it's just entertainment whatever it is it will dull your spiritual seeing and hearing it does that it's just a natural thing that it happens because it's the wrong spirit it's not the spirit of god it's the spirit of the devil and yet we are to be in it but not of it don't eat it but you're meant to actually go and you've got to actually treat it as a tool so there's a tool you know you have to go and earn money right you've got to go and have a job you know you've got to go do those things but it's part of another kingdom it's not the kingdom of god that's why you hear so much preaching and things like that don't let your heart open to the entertainment of the tree of knowledge you know if you could only just cross over and begin to be receive your joy from the actual creator of joy you know i know this i may sound like a broken record but god created joy the devil didn't god knows how to give you real joy real happiness but you have to repudiate the tree of knowledge you have to just you have to disdain that thing and it's very hard because the flesh just magnetizes to it because the flesh is part of it you know that it's hybrid that's why it likes that but but but god says you need to love the lord with your strength so that means to bring your flesh subject you know and i've and i've been guilty of also saying oh my flesh all it wants to do is not serve the lord but actually the lord is the the lord has actually asked that our flesh loves him hallelujah you know what it says it says if the same spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you it shall quicken your mortal body now he says that in the rising of the sun the prophet actually puts a effort into saying no it's not just for them like because i always you know you kind of think oh that's the rapture you know you're going to get quickened in your mortal body going to be changed and that is really the fullness of it but now quickened by the the power of the holy ghost amen temporary resurrections who's had a temporary resurrection amen oh my i've had a few of those hey man oh my i love it when this you know you go through a service and you did the lord just pours out and you just have a temporary resurrection into another place man you're just having a good time hallelujah that's the children's bread and he says if you eat of that bread you're gonna live forever amen and he's saying look here i am i am the vine and you're the branches and the devil will do everything he can to thwart your connection to his vine and it's it's a very simple connection like i said it's just faith it's just faith no fear perfect love he is perfect love cast out all the fear so that you can connect back on the vine it's just faith and the prophet says the reason is of fear is why we don't put our whole trust in the tree of knowledge tree of life and we look we can look at people over the years and ages that have done and you can see the fruit of it amen but then the same one that is the tree of life and like i said the devil will do everything he can to block us from being able to connect with with christ by making us busy by doing all these different things by fear in our life and it may be deep seated within us and we don't know why it's there but it's there and there's a reason why it's there and the lord will discern it for you he will actually discern that thing in your life to unblock that so that you can connect on the simplicity of the faith in christ but the devil will do everything to you as an individual but it's same as he did everything at the start of the church ages you know they were connected to the tree of life and you know they were in such a place that they could have just been raptured you know that they could they were imperfect love they were in this environment of perfection and yet and and they were they could have been raptured but it couldn't be at that time and the devil did everything he can to try and sever that tie and he began to corrupt things and he began to introduce the tree of knowledge into the church so the church became intertwined with the tree of knowledge and even in the reformations it was still intertwined but it was getting worse better and better and better a little less and less and less and then all these truths of the scripture were all scattered throughout all the denominations and then god sent him elijah the prophet to come and take it and consolidate all those truths into one message and that is the message that you're under amen and that is a revelation of him and he is the tree of life and if you just have simple faith in him you'll be connected back to the fullness of the tree of life again and live forever and that is the ingredients of the rapture right there is faith in him who has been revealed in fullness oh that is the message of the hour amen jesus said and there everyone dead eternally separated see talking about the same people in the wilderness but i'm the bread of life that come from god out of heaven a man eats this bread he'll never die see he's the tree of life hallelujah amen oh my god you know i feel so happy about this amen tree of knowledge now it says here oh i'm not actually so just to give you a context i'm not actually going to go right into like the genesis story in this service so that is actually later on we're just doing an overview of the two trees where they come from their ambitions and how to connect with them you know but we will just touch on this a little bit here so it says here and out and i've got two versions here because you know this version here is another version that just helps to understand the what it means so it says out and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and go and now this is in the set version it says and god made to spring up also out of the earth every tree beautiful to the eye and good for food and there's a break there and then it says and the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tree of learning the knowledge of good and evil so now you have this introduction of a of a verb of learning now it becomes an effort now it's taking a whole new approach the tree of knowledge of good and evil the tree of life is not learning on a human level it's given by revelation but the tree of knowledge of good and evil is actually the tree of learning the knowledge of good and evil it's a tree of human effort it's a tree of human achievement as a tree of pride to be raised up into a pedestal situation like the devil because he says i will i will i will i will and he put himself above the angels and he began to preach to them and he came up with a better solution a better civilization something a bit more interesting and bigger because when you look at christ and you look at the civilization of christ it looks simple and maybe to someone that's been eating of the tree of knowledge too long looks boring because you're feeding off the wrong spirit and then it looks boring because it's hidden away it says it's hiding in simplicity the love of god the simplicity of the gospel and the civilization that works perfectly and it's the greatest civilization there is the greatest atmosphere there is the greatest it's the most sustainable way of life is christ's way and and when you finally break into it you have such an amazing time you live this life and it's like you know i mean it's not it's not this big glittery thing but it's powerful it's real and it's it's like um what's the word wholesome and loving and the families just are better we're just a better people not by our own strength but by the love of god by the grace of god because you are coming under the the the leadership and the grace of the tree of life and he's bringing life back to you instead of death and separation but when you're feeding on the wrong tree and you become a learner and you're putting all this effort in and all your affections go into this other stuff then all of a sudden that you you almost can't even connect with the wrong the right tree anymore because ever since man began to eat of the tree of knowledge it separated him from god and the initial eating of that and becoming and i want to get to another thought here adam sorry lucifer in the beginning because the tree of knowledge of the learning of knowledge of good and evil was an option it's not you know like because before lucifer did what he did he chose to another plan and that plan of knowledge and wisdom was another option because he had free moral agency he could choose something so he made he chose another option and he was inspired by his own wisdom and teaching and he began to preach that and he became the very root of the tree of knowledge of good and evil he became the very inspiration behind it and now he was looking for branches he's looking for someone to believe him it's looking for someone to execute his will he's looking for people to have faith in what he's saying and he got angels to do it first and then he got eve to do it and eve became the first branch the human branch of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and she became a fruitful branch brother brandon said that she was of that tree and he said that she ate the fruit of her womb that fruit became the fruit of the tree of knowledge she put her faith in what the serpent was teaching her sorry the serpent was the first uh branch the first on the earth and the physical the serpent was the first one to subscribe to the tree of knowledge because he yielded his whatever however conscious he was he yielded his will to satan and then satan took over the serpent and then the serpent began to become a branch the serpent started doing what the devil was telling him started speaking for the devil and then eve she's like hearing that truth uh false truth and and and twisted perversion a perverted civilization a perverted way a perverted idea and she by believing that she separated herself from the tree of life and believed what the serpent was telling her and she in her own self became a branch because she yielded herself to the vine of the tree of knowledge so now coming out of the vine was her fruit and then adam did the same thing so now anyone this is now that's what i was saying i'm going to introduce another thought here anyone now that begins to subscribe to this becomes a branch for it if they eat it if they devour it are you devouring the tree of knowledge is anyone in here devouring the tree of knowledge anybody are you eating it are you eating it sorry i just i felt like doing that was it scary i hope you don't look at me don't eat it it should be scary i would not want to be devouring that tree because if you devour that tree you're endangering yourself of becoming a branch to it becoming fruitful for the wrong tree now that doesn't mean you can't go work you're gonna go work but you're not eating that because you've been called to eat something else the mighty angel came down with an open book gave a message and he says to you to you to all of us come and eat it eat the body word of the son of man what is that it's the best thing to eat and when you devour it oh my do you know johnny ate it all he didn't just eat a little bit he ate the whole lot amen and then he could prophesy then john had a message hallelujah john had something to go tell the nations and if you want something to go tell the nations then you need to eat the word and don't devour anything else amen hallelujah jesus prayed a prayer which i believe is like you know here's the son of god praying this prayer that they would be in the world but not of the world and it was like from that moment this mandate was on the devil hurt not the oil and the wine don't you ever cross the bloodline satan you have a restriction from that day forward my people they do need to go and work they do need to do these things they need to participate in certain things within that tree but they will not you will not cross them you will not take them and they will not eat of that tree and yet it'll become a tool to them like the money system you know the money system is a is a demon it's demonic it's demonic but you forgot you you know you've got power over them authority over the demons and if you've got authority over the demons and you're the head and not the tail you're in a royal seat of abraham then then you're blessed and then you follow the systems of god so that he can bless you and then you don't have to serve money money will serve you hallelujah man money has a place in our life and it's under our feet hallelujah not you know it's a lot of people money's up here for them and they're so concerned about it and when there's anything to fail about they get so touchy don't it's just a tool that's just a tool of the devil for his kingdom but i'm so thankful john 17 the lord prayed that prayer that they would be in it but not of it oh look because if you're of something then you are you know you are what you eat you know that if you eat a whole bunch of kfc and mcdonald's you're going to become real unhealthy and fat because you will that's not healthy but if you eat nice vegetables and fruits and a balanced diet you're going to become strong hallelujah it's the same thing spiritually if you feast and devour the wrong things then you're going to become spiritually fat and unhealthy and broken down and your spirit is going to be just broken but if you begin to feast and devour the word that's been handed to you too given to you hallelujah then you become strong amen you see moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying ezekiel 28 11 to 13 it says son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the son full of wisdom and perfect and beauty so now we're tracing now he's speaking to this king of of of tyre which was a kingdom of the devil which was a natural kingdom but a devil worshiping kingdom and yet he wasn't speaking to that king he was speaking right through him and prophesying to lucifer and he's saying and so when you see this you'll see and he's because what king you don't know king attire even being eden you know it says here now they'll seal us up some full of wisdom and perfect and beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so so you see now the lord enabled that to happen because he knew that lucifer and his free will would do what he did but then there would become a way for god to reveal himself and the attributes of savior and father and healer and redeemer would be able to be expressed and re avenger hallelujah i love the i love the attribute of avenger and not our avenging is avenging amen oh my that devil's got it coming he's got it coming saints hallelujah that was perfect here sorry and i have set this so thou was upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire ezekiel 28 15 says thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee he was discerned by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence what is his kingdom look at the civilization it's violent killing straight away kane killing when's that civilization and just their imaginations was just evil killing and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as a profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire so you can know now you are a living stone sons of god the kingdom of god the temple of god and you are a son of a god who says he's a consuming fire so if gods are consuming fire you're a consuming fire because you're his children you're his family and if you're baptized with the fire of god then you become a stone of fire amen you become a living stone built up in the temple of god and fiery amen and god has promised that this devil that's covering over all these things and just brooding over everything and trying to take over and trying to be proud in your life trying to make you subscribe to his channel trying to make you eat his book he's going to be destroyed from your midst he's got an expiry date glory that's a rejoicing point there he's got an expiry date the heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom there you go this is now the lord discerning what he took wisdom and he corrupted it he perverted truth and he began to change things to his own agenda by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee brother branham says this he says it was satan's ambition to be worshipped like god and now he is ready with his careful selected educated bride by his own knowledge here you have now a revelation that it's his knowledge that is actually the very stream that comes out through that tree and when you put your faith in that when you begin to devour that you become that oh my never let anything that you participate in that comes from this tree be any more than at all any more than a utility to get you by naturally amen amen never never raise it up any higher than a status of tool or utility because that's all it could ever be and if it ever becomes more than that then it becomes idolatry then it becomes something and and and god you know you think oh god as a jealous god you know he just doesn't want me to do anything but the reason is that his spirits behind the tree of knowledge brother branham says you can get to this education education until you get to the demon of education you know that and you begin to worship it because it goes it becomes a god and when it becomes that and it goes over that then you begin to eat it then it's going down into a place within you which is where god meant to be you don't want to invite the devil's ways in his tree of knowledge and his wisdom and his corruption into where god is meant to be never hallelujah remember god created joy he created the when you have the most funnest time in your life and you'll rejoice and have a good time you know whatever it may be just remember god can do it better if it's not from god god's got a better way he's got a better way to please you a better way to make you feel happy a better way to balance your life a better way to exhilarate your emotion if you need that and we do need to have fun there's nothing wrong with having a good time amen hallelujah there's a lot of healthy things amen see all so he says by his own knowledge see all painted up in his deceit of big buildings and big denominations and paints of knowledge and theology and smart and intellectual and educated to to see the whole world and become a god that's what he done and he says here in adoption he says so god in his infinite mercy he saw that lucifer would do that if he created this he had put them onto a free moral agency that basis and you're still there that's right the tree of right and wrong is set before every one of us you make your choice it's your decision absolutely but once one decision will lead you into a life of hell and one decision will lead you into a life of joy and peace and some and then there's minor decisions that will just give you this and that whatever but decisions have consequences i don't know so while we do have our own choice there is a lot of wrong choices to be made that can be made let's not make those choices amen hallelujah let's be discerning you know i was talking to a guy last night you know you know he he was asking about voices and thoughts and all that and i said you know the power i said you've got authority but what good is authority without discernment if you don't know where to use it and what to use it on you know if you just got this you got it because you're a son and a daughter and you've got authority you can cast out a devil you can bind things and loose things and but without discernment you just still let the devil in you'll still let him run a rampage in your head but if you can discern that and go that's the devil and he's gone because he's defeated and i'm casting him out hallelujah whatever it may be discernment makes it powerful it actually puts a real uh cements your authority because now you know how where to use it and how what to use it on hallelujah and lucifer was here and and you're still there that's right the tree of right and wrong is set before every one of us you make your choice and lucifer was the first one to take the wrong road as i said before he was the first one to take that option and he chose to corrupt the word of god and then from there came this tree that went forth of this corrupted truth and it began to grow and grow and grow and now it's filled the whole earth and it started with for his free will and pride and him wanting to rise up and think he could do a better job but let me just give you a bit of a news flash if you look out there who can say he's done a better job nobody no one can say he's done a better job even them out there know it's wrong even them can say look it's wrong it's broken it's dope it's just broken you know and everyone's on drugs or on something whether it's legal or illegal they're on something to make them feel good again because their spirit is broken well they've just inherited a whole bunch of junk in their spirit from from an inheritance naturally speaking of corruption and darkness and despair and sorrow but then god comes and he says i can heal you i can raise up a stand in your life so you don't have to fall under that thing again you have to live in that atmosphere again hallelujah he says thou art an anointed cherub that covereth yes he tries to cover your genealogy and cover you in darkness and despair and try and make you be something that just less than what your privilege says you don't have to you don't have to the first one to take the wrong way that he began to draw after him hoggish trying to take all for himself try to override somebody else and that's where it started now listen to this that's where sin began god in his infinite mind saw it this is i've just said all this so i'll just read it anyway evil was an option that lucifer took and became the first shoot for the tree of knowledge a corrupted version of the truth his root was grounded in paradise drawing water from the river of life but corrupting the dna to bring corrupted fruit you know um it's like uh if you've got an orange tree and you put a tangelo a branch on it it's like orange life orange life orange life and then when it hits the splice it goes into tangerine it's actually not the same life there's a corruption gone on on the branch you know and we don't want to have that this is what the devil did he corrupted the and and he's feeding it says that that the spirit the rain shall fall on the just and the unjust and it says in the scripture i think we'll read it soon it says that he's he's planted by the river of life he's planted by this great river and he's feasting off the power of god because there's only you know but he's corrupting it and then we go and we just entertain it and we fill our homes with it oh my help me lord oh wrong dna wrong information you know it comes out all right and then it gets corrupted we don't want that he would soon take the war of corruption from the spirit realm to the physical realm through the human race and through adam losing his inheritance lucifer would be able to squat over the creation and i put down the bottom there possess your office adam it's been given back to you amen this dominion is given back and now it starts with you as an individual before he can give you a dominion over the earth again he needs to see that there's dominion in your own life not by your own law and legalism but by love by true divine leadership by christ within you doing it and because adam you see adam he lost his inheritance there was no one controlling the earth anymore there was no one to to to keep the gardens anymore because god created adam to do it and to keep it and to say dominion over the fish and the sea and every land and all of it and he lost it so it was just sitting in no man's land so the devil's squatting over it that's why he's the prince of the power of the air that's why he's doing all these things and he can he tries to storm kill jesus and he then jesus rises up and shows that he's possessing the office again and now he's saying to you possess your office amen don't just let the devil trample all over you amen don't just let the devil just overcome you of all these fears make him regret it make him regret coming to attack you hallelujah you ask god for some tools ask god to give you some powerful wall tools and when the devil comes to you you begin to release the the power of god on the devil because you've got authority and you've got discernment because this message has come to give you discernment it's come to help you to know the to divide light and darkness and to know what's evil hallelujah and so if you know what's dark and what's wrong and you know when the devil's attacking you you know that that's the devil and he's exposed himself you know that he's showed his cards and you can see it's a bluff no matter what it is no matter how big this big problem is in your life he's shown his cards now he's he's exposed and he's a bluff and he shows you all this list of things that you struggle with and you can know it was defeated at calvary and you are free and you can now make the devil really have a bad day hallelujah just by possessing your office amen the lord is looking for us as individuals now to take back dominion by the dwelling of the holy spirit to raise you up above the authority of darkness amen hallelujah glory to god but remember prophet says and separation from unbelief he says in heaven what made lucifer jealous well he goes over in the north and puts him up a better kingdom he wanted a bigger kingdom a more brighter better prettier the devil always works in beauty sure he does that's the reason cain offered what he did for his offering but there was no beauty in abel bringing his lamb but abel had a spiritual revelation from god amen who's thankful for revelation oh my your prophet said the greatest thing you can ask for from the lord is revelation just lord give me revelation reveal this to me make it real to me oh my if you could ask anything just ask for that when something quickens to you you say lord reveal that to me make it substance in my life hallelujah you know when he reveals something to you it's with you forever the devil cannot take it from you hallelujah it's yours you've possessed it you've gained it it's now substance in your life it's part of you amen abel had spiritual revelation from god that's that that's what god would be pleased with and as we have said only through spiritual revelation can you ever know god you'll never know him by knowledge you see the devil his whole model is that you make an effort to learn something and you go to school and you go get a degree or a phd or you go do an apprenticeship or you go do whatever you do you live all these years and you struggle well a lot of us do some people just fly through it you know it's easy they've got like a real high big brain and it just works easy for some of us it's very hard and you've got to work hard and you've got to strive and that's the way it works for the tree of knowledge but not for the tree of life aren't you so glad he knew that there would be dummies like me that just needs revelation hallelujah and actually the the smaller that you can become the more he can reveal to you hallelujah you know you could have you could have no memory but if he reveals it to you remember it all because it's beyond that hello your soul is beyond your spirit amen if he just puts it in your soul oh my and then he begins to inspire you he said take no thought what you shall say in those days because it will be inspired to you hallelujah is higher than your memory never fear hallelujah because what's given to you is higher than your human spirit that's higher than your memory it's greater than it amen you'll never know him by knowledge because you see it's the absolute polar opposite it's given to you by revelation hallelujah i'm going back into ezekiel now and this is another um time where the lord is dealing with the devil and exposing him and he says here all the fowls of heaven made their nests and his bowels that's the tree bells and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nations so you you see all civilization is under the shadow of his tree this tree of knowledge and the devil taking him up to a high mountain luke 4. now that's why i had this picture here because now the devil now here's christ the second adam and now the devil is going to show his cards again and he says and the devil taking them up into an high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time man that's pretty that you know you know you don't underestimate this enemy don't underestimate him because if he can take our lord and he can show all the kingdom of the world that are under his umbrella in the moment of time don't you think that he could this is why you need discernment this is why you need the sermon this is why that innocent thing that you think is okay to do may just be the thing that destroys you for ten years destroys you your whole testimony this is this is how the devil if you just let a spirit in it can just wreak havoc that's why discernment is so important so important and i just thankful you know i'm saying these things to you because you have it i'm not saying it to you because you don't have it because then it would be like a carrot in front of you that you can't attain but you've got discernment hallelujah it's within you take no fear have no fear just trust in the tree of life put your faith in him let fear dissolve because perfect love is here perfect love is here you know paulie was so happy when epaphroditus or whatever his name is told him that they had the colossians were so loving they had the love of the spirit around them then he started praying that they could be increased in knowledge and in the power of god and begin to work because there was love love is the basis of all operation love is the basis for fellowship love is the basis for progress and for grace to really abound for people to give their lives to god in their atmosphere and so this is where we're at we love each other and we fight for love we fight the devil not each other amen hallelujah amen i think you're ready to fight amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so he says for this is and the devil said on him all this power will i give to thee and the glory of them for this is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will give it my this is very these are big statements you know you know we think oh well this is the whole world every country every kingdom every government is under this guy here under his tree of knowledge and and and then he's just got all this stuff going on and he's going to give this to the lord hallelujah thankfully the lord you know he didn't he wasn't even going to put up with that because he's going to take it all anyway it all belongs to the to the lord jesus he will and he'll take it back amen hallelujah and you know what he was going to take back first take it back within you because the devil's the devil was squatting on your land squatting in your life and so jesus said you know what i'm going to come down in the end time in the fullness of my glory and i'm going to enter into my bride and they're going to take back their land and they're going to take back little by little but it's all going to come back to them and this is where you're at you're taking back your land you're taking back your inheritance the devil try to offer you this and maybe you're right there where the lord is was in the wilderness and the devil's offering you kingdoms and offering you the tree of knowledge and offering you all these opportunities but you need to stand just like jesus and say get there behind me satan i'm not going to participate or eat of your tree i'm not going to eat of that because i know what that does i've got discernment i live under the power of an open book i live under the power of the body word of the son of man hallelujah true revelation of jesus christ hello i'm not going to put up with these things amen you've got to tell the devil you've got to address them and get oh my just deal with them hallelujah amen you resist them submit to god let god's power take over your life and then you begin to resist the devil how is that you begin to rebuke him you begin to cast him out you begin to pray for people you pray for your family you begin to enter into prayer hallelujah and you you got full authority over the devil amen if thou therefore would worship me all shall be thine but all that will do is bring death and then we're back to ezekiel 31 again since thus was he fear in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great waters as i was saying before the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir trees were not like his bowels and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in his beauty i have made him fear by the multitude of his branches so that all trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied him and brother brown says this and pillar of fire he says there were two trees in the garden of eden one of them was the tree of knowledge and the other was the tree of life man left the tree of life to eat the tree of knowledge and he's separating his self from god and ever since then by knowledge he's drove himself away from god god's not known by knowledge he's known by faith that's right and one of the greatest curses is because man is so acclimatized to the tree of knowledge he tries now to get to god by knowledge so it's not just he's having faith in the devil's corruption he's actually sincerely trying to find god by educating and there's seminaries and all these schools that are trying to teach and people trying to learn and trying to get closer to god and they're approaching them through the devil's system and this is why it's so important that we come back to the simplicity of christ and have faith real faith and say lord if if you find because you have the tree is known by its fruit and if your branch if you are not fruitful if the fruit's not there you say lord i believe but then you can say lord why is it that i feel like i'm not connected because it's just a simple thing he is the vine and you're the branches and if he abides in you and you and him then you will be fruitful and the tree of not life will come up through you and you'll be fruitful and there will be seed within your life and then when people eat that seed they begin to grow and you plant seeds you know this the whole purpose of fruit is to reproduce the whole purpose of fruit is to disperse seed hallelujah that's why he wants you to be fruitful he doesn't just want you to be it's not just an airy fairy oh you're such a loving christian it's so that life can come through you it's so that people can see you and eat the fruit of your life and and then they take the seed that's the whole purpose they can enjoy the sweetness of your life enjoy all the good things that come from the fruit of your life but the seed is what's important and the awesome thing is you didn't make that fruit happen it's just that you have the simplicity of faith and you simply believe in him and if there's a hindering thing where that where you connect to the vine maybe there's just like a little complex there or something there that's like are causing you to unbelieve and you just this is how simple it is lord why can't i connect with you and he'll show you it might come through the pulpit it might come through it might come in a vision or a dream or whatever he will show you he wants you to be connected he wants you to be part of the tree he wants you to be fruitful amen am i what's the time oh oh my my it's all reading from now on true of knowledge and he's separating himself from god and ever since then by knowledge he's drove himself away from god god's not known by knowledge he's known by faith that's right there were two trees in the garden of eden one of them was knowledge and the other one was life and when a man went off the tree of life to eat the tree of knowledge he always tried to figure things out from then on see that he's never he never has got it straightened out yet there's only one way to be a christian the word christian means christ-like and you can't do it you can't work it in yourself there's no way at all that you can do it you have to forget yourself die out to yourself oh my goodness self oh it can be such a pain hey who believes that oh man the ups and the downs but he says love me with all your strength so what is that now you drag your sorry flesh to church amen you dragged your flesh to use meetings you dragged your sorry flesh to pray drag it amen force it until finally it starts liking it hallelujah and one day you're going to rapture and you drag it up there and finally thank you i stole that from brother donnie that one's got a lot of mileage in it but that's what you got to do sometimes you just got to force it amen you know i talked to brother isaac about going to you know how he says because you know we talk about how this one you know and they're just someone's just not coming to church anymore and it's like you know and he says he just says you know what doesn't matter sundays i'm at church period doesn't matter how i feel that's irrelevant i'm going to church and this is where you know you could have all these things going on everything up and down but no i'm going amen hallelujah you're always thankful at the end amen hallelujah you can't do it you have to forget yourself die out to yourself and let christ come in and live the life of christ in you amen we're now i'm finishing by the way this is actually literally second to last quote we're going 1600 miles per hour today still moving on because science is eating off this tree of knowledge and we are over here the preachers and we are over here the preachers oh the knowledge will only run so far then it falls backwards hallelujah but the tree of life has no end to it oh my we got untapped resources amen saints you've got untapped resources they don't diminish they just keep going and getting better and better and better untapped there's untapped resources for your healing for your deliverance for your change hallelujah for you to have faith hallelujah faith is not something you manufacture faith is something that he gives you i give all men a measure of faith he says in romans 12 11 or something he says that oh man every man has a measure it's given to you but sometimes it's severed by something and it might be the tiniest thing it might be a great thing in your life but god can deliver you god can respond restore that and
