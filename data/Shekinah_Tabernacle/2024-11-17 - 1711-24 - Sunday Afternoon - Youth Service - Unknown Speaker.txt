bless these people Lord in Jesus Christ's name we ask you this amen amen let just um stand let's open our Bibles in the Book of John chapter 3 verse 14 thank you Mr James oh boy [Music] and the Bible says and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that what whosoever believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life amen you can have your seat this afternoon well this is the first youth meeting it's a pleasure to be here so what I want to talk today is a to be aware of snakes I know some people here in New Zealand they don't know really snakes CU you don't have but for my friends from South Africa and other countries you know snakes right right are you scar snakes no no they're not very likable creatures anyways I have caught to by the head in South America but they don't have venom so they can buite you but they don't do anything else I grab two by the head so feel so cool so first of all I want to talk um oh this screen this one okay as a context because we're going to talk about the brass serpent so let's talk about the um Israel and what happened Genesis 15 says and he said unto Abraham not Abraham yet just Abraham no assur thee that thy SE shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them for 400 years and also that Nation who they shall save will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance how many years 400 years here in Exodus 12 says now the souring of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was 430 years and it came to pass at the end of the 430 years even the self same day it came to pass that all the hes of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt when I WR wrote this thing I mean the first time that I read it and I was a kid I was like oh a contradiction in the Bible but actually it's not a contradiction because they were not slave those 30 years Joseph was still alive the Bible says that the next Pharaoh he didn't know Joseph that's when they became um slaves so who knows what is a slave what's a slave where we that's a very actual description but a slave is a person who is forced to work for and Obey another and is considered to be their property so they're not considered as humans they're just like a piece of meat that has to do whatever they want we have a picture here how slave were treated we can see the face of that guy looking like I better hurry up or I'm going to be the next one to receive the whips and but Israel was slave they were a slave for 400 years that's a long time that's a very long time and those 400 years there was no prophecy so if you take your Bible and go to the book um The Book of Malachi and the Book of Matthew there is a wide page right the one that said New Testament that page means 400 years again that nothing happened in those 400 years was just silence but the Lord didn't want Israel to be slaves all the time he delivered them with a mighty hand ni yeah very Mighty the Miracles and everything was just awesome but when they started to walk if you go to Google and if you search like how long take someone from Egypt to Israel The Mex is like three weeks or four weeks working only 6 hours per day for them took them 40 years that's that's long so they started to felt like tired and this what they said we remember the fish we we did eat in Egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leaks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there's nothing at all beside this manner before our eyes there were they didn't remember the whips or the treat that the Egyptians were giving them and they the way that they said like we don't have anything just beside this Mana that comes from Heaven it's like the Lord was giving them the best and they were like no no we're getting tired of this I hope that's another way that you're feeling because this is for the young ones say you have receiving Mana this the the scriptures that the word is open for some of us we that we come from um denomination th this is a new Bible for me this is a new Bible but you guys are you grabbing this probably you can feel like I grab here but I pray that you don't feel that way cuz this is glorious so numbers 21 chap um verse 4 says and they J Jour it see that's that is why I need a microphone here okay who's going to help me to read Lilia God bless you is it on thank and they journeyed from the Mount Hall by the way of the Red Sea to come past the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul Lo this this light bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died W can you give the microphone to m 12 us therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses may make thee a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon the snake shall live and Moses made a serpent out of brass and put it upon the bowl and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived amen so this is I remember when I was reading this when I was a kid I was like amazed like snake out brass but we shouldn't make like you know idols and stuff it was not an it was not an idol back then they just had to look at it and see the power of God giving them like the antidote for that um those bites amen so do we know what a serpent means serpent means sin right of course EMB brass like judgment is that right so that brass serpent it means like the sin was already like getting judged that's why they were able to receive the um the forgiveness and be healed right amen am I right brother you're preaching after me so you can fix this m and got a question here for you guys what was the name of the brass serpent so the option one is the Sneaky Snake um cushan and D we're going to know this soon so the brass serpent one was there can you I didn't put any picture of how the bite of a snake looks like for Priscilla's sake cuz after showing my fingers last time she almost pass out but it looks bad it start to look black cuz all the everything just start to die it's very dangerous getting beaten by his snake but they received this um cure from Heaven that that the lord gave them um Hebrews 10 says um by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest stand daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which we can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from hence forth expect until this till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he had prefect perfected forever them that are Sanctified that's you and me so only one sacrifice yeah it may you clean the rest of the journey amen but what does Sin producing you this is what happened to Adam and Eve they didn't want to see God because they were ashamed so they were trying to hide and that's what seem producing people when you see you see you think like oh I cannot come to church I cannot sing a special of being bad during the week but you have received the Cure from Heaven there's no sin for you if you believe in Christ amen and oh man I I think I been here for like 2 minutes but I need to tell you like a little testimony when I was a kid probably when I was only like eight or 10 years old my parents give me a pxa but I remember I did not um deserve it un Justified PX so I got angry and I knew there was one um and for how do you say this word unforgivable sin like there's only one sin that doesn't have the um amen I don't know how to say the word but I got angry and I said it with my lips I said like I'm not going to tell you guys cuz we don't want you to say it but I got angry and I said the words like I blah blah blah and after that I didn't fill it with my heart I was just angry but from that moment on that was like probably 9 or 10 the devil just start to telling me like you are done there's nothing else that you can do you cannot go back you're done so what happened to me so the way that I was done I just uh sinning cuz I I didn't have I knew that I was not going to get like forgiven for that so I started sinning and for you young people like don't don't this this is the whole sermon like if you have seen or if you you have done something don't think that you are cut off from God cuz you have the vaccine from Heaven that can clean you from every sin amen so what happened it's like when you sin then you think that you are Cast Away From God you cannot go back so you keep sinning and sinning and sinning and the thing that was only one sin it just become a whole life sing and it took me like 13 years to real lies that that was a lie that was the moment that I listen that sermon from Brother brandham it was like it's not just if you say it it's like what do you do with that and I received this um Revelation and I was like because the Lord changed my life and everything and I was like for 13 years I just lived aive and this is something that I don't want any anyone that is here to live like we can be forgiven for our sins but we have to confess them and pray and just move away from them you don't have to carry on sinning like yeah oh wow here we go is this screen we know that God he more than able to clean our lives amen it's hard for me to put a picture of um Jesus on the cross because I I grabbing a Pentecostal church and they are like kind of vampires they don't like to see crosses if they see a cross they like they in my house there was never a cross or anything but we know there is just the symbol of um for our beliefs so the name of the brass serpent was nean how many of you got it right 3 four five l okay that was a hard one it's just in the book of U Second Kings says um talking about ezekiah he removed the high places and break the image and cut down the grooves and break in pieces the brassen serpent that Moses had made for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and it called it nushan so they transform that symbol into an idol that they were not allowed to do but they did this is our Lord Jesus Christ talking said behold I give you unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hi you we are more than conquerors in Jesus Christ amen there's no sin that can just infect you because we have the Cure that the Lord gives amen and yeah this is just the breth that I he in my heart cuz when when you commit a sin or something you really feel like I can't go back you don't even want to pray when you're like when you have done something but you shouldn't feel that way cu the Lord he died for your sins amen he BEC sin for you amen let's just have the musicians I'm sorry for [Applause] okay I'm going to take my attribution here what song Can I Do What song Can I do

thank you musicians thank you brother Mo appreciate uh the songs um let's just go to the book of First Timothy I know I've read it a few times but just this one verse here and um then we're going to go into being paralyzed snake venom paralyzes right there's lots of snakes out there but we've already heard there's an antidote so I think that's good it's good to hear the good news before the I don't know the other news anyway so 1 Timothy 1:18 this charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them might us fight a good Warfare amen so let's let's pray this afternoon almighty God we thank you so much Lord for this opportunity we can gather just pray Lord you just have preeminence Lord may your presence be so real in our midst father touch our hearts Lord speak to each one we love you Lord we thank you so much in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can have your seat so that we so we want to fight a good Warfare hey we want to fight a good Warfare we don't want to fight a bad Warfare average Warfare we want to fight a good one fight the good of Faith now we need to know the battlefield that we're in it's very important because you're you're equipped for the battlefield so for example right now this is World War II so this is the Kota Trail in Papa New Guinea okay jungle warfare stinking hot mud mosquitoes disease you don't wear a lot of you know you're wearing summer clothing jungle fighting very different kind of conditions okay now the contrast of this is uh this is I think Russian soldiers in the on the Russian front in World War III wintertime harsh cold bitter very cold okay both those battlefields are different aren't they like you wouldn't wear those kind of see that's all ice on them by the way okay they ice blizzard so you wouldn't wear that kind of clothing here because you'll uh get heat stroke you'll die just from the clothing you're wearing but at the same time you wouldn't wear the these clothing here cuz you're freeze to death okay so you got to be aware of the battle and how the enemy works on that Battlefield okay so now we we are we are in all in a battle children whether you like it or not we're here in a battlefield okay so we got to be aware of the conditions that we're facing and how the enemy comes against us right so now the conditions of the battlefield we live in as we live in this leosan age where Lan means everyone wants their rights okay and it's a lukewarm age right because so lukewarm now it means lacking conviction means half-hearted it's an age of apathy people are indifferent They Don't Really Care right you take the average kiwi not really passionate about much really maybe they all black sometimes right they're not very passionate people you know not very emotional kind of people why because there's a lot of apathy and when there's apathy there's no motivation to live to strive to do things better just kind of float along and then being lukewarm means lacking conviction being half-hearted so there's a spirit in this world that wants us to be this way okay there's a spirit in this world that wants us to be this way and it's also of course everyone wants their rights lady means the people's rights so but remember a Christian fits their rights because we fulfill everything to God we don't want our rights we want God's rights okay so we got to be aware of this because if we walk into this world and we're facing the enemy the wrong way we're going to get shot okay if you look at the battlefield World War II there especially on the uh Russian steps big open terrain long range flat ground you know you can't you can't walk around there like you would in the jungle where it's close it's dense it's it's different so you so they had to be trained to be in the battlefield they're in so now we've got to be aware that there's a spirit in this world that wants to make us feel this way okay and we understand that the apostle Paul spoke of what this world would be like the world we're in okay so he says know this also then the last days perilous time shall come so we're living in the last days is everyone with me class okay everyone on the front row here yes president accounted for yep good hello good so he says this this is the condition so remember all these conditions nothing just happens in a vacuum you know but there's a deliberate work of the enemy to make this come into manifestation but of course it was prophesied it would come because God always forars us of the conditions of the battlefield that we'll be born into so they'll be lovers of their ownselves Covetous boaster proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural without natural affection so they won't yeah we could break this all down but just to save time Tru Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despises those that are good traitors HD highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power from such turn away right for uh for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead silly women later with sins lead away with d lead sorry lead captive silly women later with sins lead away with diverse lusts this is an age where things can creep into your home doesn't have to knock on the front door doesn't have to be a a piece of mail in the Box it just can slip in through a device and make people captive okay so now we got to be aware of this right we're not just remember we may be sheep but we have a great Shepherd okay and he instructs us to stay with him his word right but now Paul would say and through covetousness they shall make with f make shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you this world wants to make merchandise of you okay it wants to use you as a commodity right so a feigned word means an artificial one something that's molded it's it's false so they'll speak a false thing to you to make you to to to make merchandise out of you now I'm coming to now this is basically through the world of media okay I'm saying how the snake bites okay because we're going to realize like like the Bible says that you know the devil walks around like a roaring lion devouring who he will what does that look like you know is heit are we literally going to see a lion walking around who's seen a lion walking around the streets devouring people but yet he's he he's doing that but how's he doing it see if we're if we don't know how he's doing it how can we defend ourselves right so now so how he walks around is he is is is by by media by social media by movies Music Television the internet what is he doing he's he's with fed words trying to make merchandise out of you that's why people like social influencers they want you to subscribe they want you to click the Bell button to get notifications what's that they're trying to put their teeth into you to hold on to you that you become a captive audience that as soon as there's a ding-ding in your pocket you're you're there right what is that it is actually making merchandise of you because they make money out of you right this is how but but but but there's Venom in the fangs right because remember the internet there's nothing wrong with the Internet but it's what are you using it for because it'll either and we'll get to it but it will either paralyze you or you'll paralyze it that's right right so either either the glamour of this world will paralyze you paralyze your faith or you'll paralyze it your faith will paralyze it but it's your choice how you want it to be like we look at lot you I mean let's just look at the word paralyze so this is not really in order but you know let's look at being paralyzed uh so to take so so so to be paralyzed you've been affected by paralysis snake's venom paralyzes the mouse or snakes Venom paralyzes a person right and it's to make them powerless or ineffective see the devil wants us to be ineffective or powerless this is what the devil wants to make us this is what our enemy on this battlefield wants to make us he's not necessar interested in taking your life he just doesn't want you to be powerful right but God through his word wants you to be powerful see God sent you in this age doesn't matter what age you are to shake the kingdom of hell am right to lay ruin to his Works to cast down his everything he's done right but paralysis is a complete or partial loss of function especially when involving the motion or sensation in the part of a body it's a loss the ability to move or the state of powerlessness or in uh incapacity to act so something's been you know someone's been paralyzed with fear they're so fearful they can't act in a situation why because fear has paralyzed them right or who like whoever's who who has ever had a dead leg or you've slipped on your your hand and you wake up and there's no feeling it can't you can't really move it what it's partially paralyzed right cuz some weight has been on it you can't move it like and eventually you rub it you you pins the needles and then it's it's back right but if you kept the weight on it eventually that will get worse and worse what your limb becomes paralyzed and it's the same thing with your faith see the devil wants to paralyze your faith that it doesn't have the ability to act in your life anymore it doesn't matter what age we are this will this is going to affect us this is the battlefield we're in okay so you know we look at lot okay lot was in Sodom and Gomorrah we know that we're living in the days of lot again but lot's conscience was vexed he was grieved by his neighbors he was grieved by what he saw in the news in Sodom and Gomorrah he was grieved by what was going on about him but Sodom and Gomorrah paralyzed his faith that it was no longer effective in his life sorry this is not okay this may seem pretty down and hard and whatever but we're got to be real here the devil's not here to play tag you're it I got you I win this time no he wants to destroy you okay he wants to destroy your faith just make you that you can't act you know if someone's sick oh what do I do you know there's a you know there's a demon Spirit running ramp oh what do I do there's a bad atmosphere paralyzed you can't even pray and sing to change the atmosphere you can't stand against us he wants to paralyze you that that the thing just runs you over but we're not here to be run over we're here to we're here to wh stand every work of the enemy all right so now brother brah says this with Moses he said he said his faith his faith his eyes didn't fall on the glamour of Egypt it fell on the promise of God right so so the the world he lived in he looked beyond the glamour of Egypt see cuz he was an eagle he looked beyond those things but then but then brother R says he says like a woman I'm always calling to you about how you should let your hair grow out you mustn't you mustn't wear makeup you must act like ladies and Christians you look out upon the streets and see woman today dressed immorally and well you think well she belongs to church why can't I do that see and she cuts her hair why can't I do that see she seems to be just as sweet and such intellectual and a personality that that I haven't even got why can't I do that I ought to do it when you do that you paralyze your faith so when you begin to look at something of the world and say I want to be like that they're like that why can't I be like that then your faith is becoming paralyzed the snake has bit you okay the poison is starting to work because your faith begins to be paralyzed see you see you haven't given your faith a chance to grow see this is what especially after camp we got to give our faith a chance to grow who wants their faith to grow who wants to give their chance of Faith to grow well don't feed on the things of the world cuz it will bite you it will paralyze your faith so what happens when your faith becomes paralyzed you become indifferent you become numb you become desensitized you're not sincere anymore you don't care so much about God or anything he does you become numb to it see that's because why the devil's trying to paralyze your faith but you got to recognize it see stand against it now now what is glamour because brother Ram says here there's you know it was the glamour either um and he says in another place either either the glamour of the world will paralyze your faith or your faith will paralyze the glamour okay okay so glamour by definition is something that's exciting or often illusory or and and romantic attractiveness it seems and and this is why you know I don't think there's any influence in the world on YouTube or Instagram or Tik Tok whatever that have boring videos that are successful I don't think there's just someone badly lit bad sound no soundtrack in the back you know someone who just like rolled out of bed looks like a mess can't speak properly I don't think any anyone any video like that is going to go far there's no glamour to it there's nothing that's alluring there's nothing that you know you'd want out of that humanly right so they always make these things extra extra extra fancy beautiful neat you know it tries to grab the emotion of a person you know these things are very deliberately done McDonald's even the McDonald's restaurant has made a deliberate way they want you to get in eat and get out they don't want you to sit there for hours they want you to get in eat and get out right and it's been designed the lighting the the colors the Aesthetics everything of that place has been deliberately done and they say the same thing with social media there's this thing called brain hacking brain hacking is a thing where and so this is from 201 I think 17 this you it's just a opening thing about an article he says that the you know Silicon Valley and all the you know the tech World they call it some Pro program is call it brain hacking and so what they wanted is they make videos to hack your brain to change your thinking this is what poison does it changes your body you can't breathe like you normally can your blood your nerves go all these different things you know why because that Venom starts acting in your body and you can't function normally and it's like what happens is our brains get hacked by what we look at you know brother Braham said that you know he would he would read tazan in the Apes who's heard of tazan when he was young who who's heard of uh The Lone Ranger Lone Star Ranger right he read those books and when and you know when he when he read tazan he said he like spent a couple of months up on a tree he wanted to be tazan right and then when he then when he read The Lone Ranger when he was a kid he said he got his mom's broom and then he and he rode it to death as a hobby horse you know what hobby horse is do you want yeah see as a horse out of a broomstick right so what happened is what he read he wanted to become the character that he read and he wasn't planning I'm going to going to be like no it's just subconsciously cuz he was enjoying what he was reading it started to change his life and this is what brain hacking the social media all these things is you got to be careful because it will change your mood it'll change how you talk it'll change your attitude it'll change your respect for your parents or your peers or you know it'll change all those things because what your brain is actually being hacked you need virus antivirus software coming there you know we got to you know what is that that is like brother Jimmy said that's the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ to wash us to change us but you see it changes us whether we like it or not see this is the Warfare we're in this is what causes the apathy the lukewarmness is the changing of the thinking where the normal world people aren't satisfied with anymore okay see we got to be aware of where we're fighting okay I'm not going to be too much longer okay but so brother BR would say now now we know everything has a spirit right there's a that's being projected like you look at um you know you look at any any any country that's gone through a massive uh shift a spirit's been released and how's it been released through preaching politicians preach who's ever seen uh not that I can understand them but who's ever seen clips of uh Adolf Hitler giving a political talk you know what he finishes his speeches with amen just like the Lutheran priests that had finished preaching that's a amen at the end but very Dynamic very what he's anointed and that spirit that got on him spread around the nation and look at what it did but it changed their thinking changed their perspective on people and nationalities and all the horrible evil that that that Nation did is because a spirit brain hacked them right and it only took the anointing of God was the only thing that could withstand that thing and it's where you say well there's no nothing like that in this day and age but there's more subtle spirits that all it want to do is stop your love and desire for God right see brother Braham says about how your spirit of rock and roll he says outside the new birth it catches their attention just as quick as they hear it because in him is Born By Nature a carnal Spirit now brain hacking knows how to manipulate that Spirit and the power of the devil is so great today till it catches the spirit of that little one now I'm not putting fear on you because we just heard the the remedy right we have the not the Brazen servant but the one who gave the Brazen servant right we have the one who can heal can can deliver it doesn't matter how paralyzed someone can be right so spiritually now so I just want to ask a question how's your spiritual walk going old and young do you need one of them spiritually do you need someone to push you into the presence of God can you walk fine you know once you fine able-bodied you can run but now you you need a wheelchair so the girls were asked me last night what are you preaching on tomorrow dad is it going to be something juicy someone said I was that Mama anyway she's one of the girls you know going to be something juicy I said well it's going to be about spiritual do you need a spiritual wheelchair yeah right so because Spirits want to grab you at a young age like Jimmy said when he was what nine you said see that Spirit want to grab him and he lived under a lie for 13 years right and so people can live under lies like a social media thing they want to be like some influencer that doesn't care nothing about you does not want to help you none doesn't want to further your life all they want to do is make merchandise of you and your life that's all they want to that's all they care about you see so but the thing is we to understand that there is an answer for people who are paralyzed and this is what we are actually obligated to do okay here's a man he's in a bed he's paralyzed but he's got friends you see to me those four friends that took him to Jesus are the his real friends see the other ones may be sympathized and oh that's so bad and poor John or I don't know what his name is you know poor Jeremiah or something you know but the four friends realize no we want to help our friend we remember when when when they used to raise their hands in church they used to praise God they would touched at Camp you know they got baptized they were really enjoying the Lord they would sing and all these things we remember when he used to walk but what's happened to him because you know people say well I just don't feel I just feel so numb what's happened a serpent has bitten you right it's this doesn't just happen you know there's a reason a door opens spiritually and something comes in a snake comes and bites right so Johnny got bit okay but his friends weren't weren't happy with him being left in this condition because they remember a time when he was younger when he could run when he could walk right so what did they do they took him to where Jesus was amen they and and they didn't take no for an answer they didn't take a crowded room for an answer they what they do get up in the roof and they took the tiles off and B them into the presence of Jesus Christ now well how do you do that you pray till every obstacle is removed right you encourage okay let's go to youth group let's sing together amen let's pray together let's come to church let's do a special you know talk about God talk about a testimony even if you say well I can't think of your you know you can't think of your own testimony think of what about your parents testimony what about testimony brother brm or something God's done talk about it right encourage amen don't just don't just say well I guess they're growing up and they're going through a difficult time and this no you got to realize there's a snake has bitten but we have the antidote amen so you got to real and and then even even Johnny maybe he was paralyzed and maybe he used to say to his friends do you remember when we used to run together do you remember when when we used to really love church and love the word and we actually asked our parents to put on a message you know or I want to see a testim do you remember that you know what because there's always a memory of what God did the devil try to make it numb your mind but there's always that memory there right so maybe Johnny was like that and Johnny was like can you get me to Jesus again can we do those things again oh but I can't move my limbs and his friends would say yeah you can I know I know the brass serpent Hallelujah I know that there's an antidote what they do they took him to Jesus amen amen so don't be discouraged but I want to say this I'm going to leave it just with this we have the musicians please I want you to think long and good about this children are you Johnny on the bed or are you the friends helping okay what are you what are you doing in our friend groups and this is with adults as well are we encouraging each other towards the Lord or are we discouraging by keeping some kind of status quo because maybe the friends you know well they wouldn't have been friends if they said no Johnny you'll be okay you know let's just let's just talk and play and you know you're you're a but let's just you know no they wouldn't be friends his real friends were ones that took him to Jesus to get that venom out of him get that paralysis out of him okay so who wants to be that kind of a friend right who who wants to be shaped by the world get off your device if you feel like you have to you've got a problem I could spend a lot of time bring up research about how there's a lot of drug addicts but they don't shoot up with needles anymore they shoot up with this we don't want to be like that but what is that that's the battlefield we're in are you dressed for the jungle to fight in the jungle are you dressed for the winter or you mixed all up you don't know what Battlefield you're in right we're in this late here friends but we're here remember we heard we have the vaccine okay and we can take Johnny amen let's real friends to each other well am I responsible for them you are your brother's keeper yes sir if you really care about them you'd be like Johnny's friends okay let's pray let's stand let's all stand shall we and let's bow our heads sincerely before the Lord you say Lord I feel a bit paralyzed just want to slip up your hand to the Lord say Lord I feel a bit numb I feel a bit distant Lord I've been feeding on the wrong things my joy is gone my desire my love my passion is gone it's been placed on my phone some dumb Channel somewhere Lord I pray you'd forgive me Lord may you the great Holy Spirit now cleanse my spiritual system from these snake bites and God bless you all with your hands raised gracious father we stand here this afternoon Lord I put myself on this too Lord we're in this battlefield Lord Jesus you see all the snakes that are running rampant biting biting people Lord making making them feel indifferent and cold and not caring about you no more father we don't want to be like that Lord Jesus I pray you'd forgive us dear God that our affections have not been set on things above on you but Lord our affections have been set on some shorts or reels or some video somewhere Lord something that don't even matter Lord and it's been dragging us down spiritually Lord I pray forgive us dear God cleanse us Lord creating us a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within us father Lord with that Joy that was once is gone may you restore it dear God and I pray father we'd be Lord like we just Lord I showed the picture of the four friends lowering their friend down into jesus' presence to be healed Lord he has paralyzed that guy but Jesus the the the Bible says that the Lord you looked at the friends and it said when you saw their faith you said you said to the man who is paralyzed rise up and walk amen Lord God I pray our faith would go into action may we not be May our faith not be paralyzed but Lord I pray that our faith would paralyze the glamour of the world that it doesn't affect us that we're not interested in it Lord but father we just walk with you and love you with all our hearts Grant it dear God May bless the hearts behind every hand that's raised we thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you amen let's sing are you playing that Open the
