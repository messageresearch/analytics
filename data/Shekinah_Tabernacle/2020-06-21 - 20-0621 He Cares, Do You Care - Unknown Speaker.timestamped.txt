[25:03] since this
[25:03] pizza has a testimony for us if you can
[25:05] come right up sister god bless you
[25:22] [Music]
[25:25] well as you all know last year
[25:29] we spent like the first four months of
[25:32] the year
[25:34] praying for me to get a job and then i
[25:36] got a job in may
[25:38] which was a six month contract
[25:41] and when it was
[25:44] four months bef i mean two months before
[25:46] the contract
[25:47] ended i then got an extension
[25:52] so it was supposed to be finishing in
[25:54] may this year
[25:56] and around much the first week of march
[26:02] i had a meeting with
[26:05] my manager's manager's manager
[26:09] and then because he's the one who hired
[26:11] me and told them you're going to work
[26:13] with this person
[26:14] so i said to him it's much my contract
[26:17] is ending in may
[26:19] i don't like to wait until the end
[26:22] should i start applying for a job
[26:25] or is there going to be an extension
[26:29] but then he had moved to another team
[26:32] altogether he said you know what
[26:33] but i know the other team is looking for
[26:38] a business analyst around the same time
[26:40] when your contract is over so i've
[26:42] already given them your name
[26:44] don't look for a job at all you've got a
[26:46] job you covered
[26:47] i said okay thank you then covet 19 hits
[26:53] and my manager says to me did you
[26:56] confirm i said well we had a meeting we
[26:59] spoke it was a verbal agreement
[27:01] he said is it in writing i said no
[27:04] is it going him and then when i went
[27:08] back he said
[27:09] well it was not inviting
[27:13] and we tried to get approval there is no
[27:16] approval
[27:18] therefore there is no job
[27:21] i said okay that's fine no problem he
[27:24] said let's meet before you go there
[27:26] wherever you're going to go i said not a
[27:28] problem
[27:30] and the week when i was
[27:33] finishing up uh
[27:37] he sent me an email just saying goodbyes
[27:40] and all that
[27:42] not a problem then
[27:45] the agency calls me and said you know
[27:47] what
[27:49] your hr has actually just told me that
[27:51] there's two managers who are interested
[27:54] in having you let's just wait and see
[27:56] it's not a good buy yet i said not a
[27:58] problem
[27:59] then eventually attended interviews then
[28:01] they absorbed me
[28:03] but there was no contract it was just
[28:05] everybody they said because you don't
[28:07] have a contract let's give you two weeks
[28:08] extension
[28:09] okay no problem they gave me the two
[28:12] weeks extension
[28:14] when the two expression finished they
[28:16] gave me another two weeks extension
[28:20] in the middle of the two weeks extension
[28:22] we had a meeting where they said okay
[28:25] we are struggling so almost half of the
[28:28] contractors are leaving these are people
[28:30] who
[28:31] have contracts until next year most of
[28:34] them
[28:35] and then their jobs were cut and here am
[28:38] i
[28:39] i've got another two suspension they say
[28:41] no you are staying you're not going
[28:42] anywhere
[28:44] when i looked i could only see god's
[28:46] work
[28:47] because i don't even have a contract
[28:50] and then actually just backtracking a
[28:55] bit
[28:55] in april just when we stayed at home
[28:59] i had prayed and asked the lord to guide
[29:01] me to get a position the same way that
[29:04] he did with this one because i did not
[29:05] apply for this one
[29:07] i got a call to say there is a job so
[29:10] even
[29:11] in april i prayed and said lord i don't
[29:13] want to be
[29:14] out there looking around begging
[29:18] if there's a job for me please let it
[29:20] come through to me
[29:22] so early in april around three people
[29:24] contacted me
[29:26] for one position so i had to give my cv
[29:29] to the
[29:30] one who first came the other two i had
[29:31] to tell them i already gave my cv for
[29:34] the same job
[29:35] and it was quiet all the time when the
[29:37] two extensions were happening
[29:41] so by
[29:44] around the second extension i think so
[29:46] that's when they called me for the
[29:47] interviews i did the interviews
[29:50] and then they called me for the test
[29:53] i did the test everything is happening
[29:55] during lockdown so everything was
[29:56] happening from the house
[29:59] but the way the interviews were going i
[30:01] was not even too sure that they'll be
[30:03] interested because
[30:05] when you're not confident when you are
[30:07] only i just told myself i can only rely
[30:09] on god because
[30:11] it's just too technical and some things
[30:14] you can hear that you're not even to
[30:16] show what you said afterwards
[30:18] then when i wrote the test it was even
[30:20] worse but god just guided me because
[30:23] i'm used to writing tests before a job
[30:27] is offered but somehow i just thought
[30:31] you know
[30:31] as much as the same in america let me
[30:33] just check is the numerical that
[30:34] happening here the same one as the one
[30:36] that i did in south africa
[30:38] then whenever i would check there would
[30:40] be this link that keeps on popping up i
[30:42] said you know what let me just try this
[30:44] one
[30:44] but it was difficult for one i had never
[30:48] seen those
[30:49] and most of them were more accounting
[30:51] based
[30:52] not my normal meds pure mess that i'm
[30:54] used to
[30:55] but then it would keep on coming up i
[30:57] said okay it's fine let me just keep on
[30:59] practicing these ones
[31:01] then when they gave me the samples for
[31:02] the tests it was
[31:04] similar questions to the one that i had
[31:06] been practicing i said lord i can only
[31:08] thank you because
[31:09] i only have about 48 hours to do this
[31:12] and
[31:12] if i had not been practicing them all
[31:14] this time
[31:15] i wouldn't know what to do
[31:18] so when i wrote the test i think it was
[31:21] about 25 questions or so
[31:23] i only managed to do eight
[31:26] and the time was up i
[31:29] said lord just make your way as the
[31:33] submission goes
[31:35] just make your way i don't know what
[31:37] they're going to find there because okay
[31:39] i've written
[31:40] all the other tests the one that is that
[31:42] i couldn't finish
[31:43] is the numerical one which is where i'm
[31:46] supposed to be having the strength
[31:50] that's my strength i love numbers but
[31:53] that was difficult
[31:54] but i just held on to the fact that they
[31:55] said to me you know what we're not
[31:57] looking for the quantity looking for the
[31:58] quality
[31:59] so don't rush to finish just make sure
[32:01] you do everything correct
[32:03] so i said if i wrote only 8
[32:06] out of 25 i'm not even too sure if i got
[32:09] the 8 correct but
[32:10] hopefully the 7 is correct i left the i
[32:13] was actually surprised when they called
[32:15] me and said you know what
[32:17] you've passed the test i said it can
[32:19] only be got i only wrote eight questions
[32:21] out of 25
[32:23] and then on the other side it keeps on
[32:26] being two weeks
[32:27] extension studios and nothing is coming
[32:29] up then eventually they said you know
[32:30] what actually
[32:32] your contract was approved a long time
[32:34] ago but it got lost along the way so
[32:36] we're still looking for it i said okay
[32:39] lord here am i i've got a contract that
[32:42] is coming which is even getting lost
[32:44] along the way i've got no clue what's
[32:46] happening
[32:47] and here am i it looks like i'm getting
[32:50] an offer i need
[32:51] you to be the one guiding me because
[32:54] personally i would have obviously
[32:55] preferred a contract because that's
[32:57] where my money is
[32:58] but with the way things are going
[33:02] it doesn't look like there's any
[33:04] certainties
[33:06] one moment you just get told no there's
[33:08] no more contracts anymore so i said look
[33:10] be the one guiding me
[33:12] then on the side of the contract they
[33:13] would give me a task today tomorrow when
[33:15] i'm trying to start they say you know
[33:17] what
[33:18] it's blocked we're going to do it next
[33:20] year
[33:21] try this one just when i get started
[33:24] no actually this one you realize that we
[33:26] don't actually need it
[33:27] we just buy a new solution to resolve
[33:29] this issue so it's solved
[33:31] another task no it's actually blocked
[33:34] then i realized that nothing that i'm
[33:37] trying on the side
[33:38] works so god is answering my prayer that
[33:42] no
[33:42] this is no way this is not the way i
[33:44] want you
[33:45] i want you going this side of a
[33:47] permanent position
[33:49] so i would really just like to thank the
[33:51] lord for guiding me
[33:53] for being the one who is there for me
[33:56] even when i know that i have
[33:57] failed it's not according to my
[34:00] knowledge or my education or anything
[34:03] it can only be him who guided the
[34:06] process
[34:06] all the way and i'm starting a new job
[34:09] on the 8th of july
[34:12] and it is a permanent position so i'm
[34:14] just
[34:15] relieved that it's not the thing that
[34:18] every six months i'm looking for a
[34:19] position
[34:20] i would really like to give honor and
[34:22] lord to the lord thank you
[34:30] amen glory to god
[34:33] amen he loves your faith my sister and
[34:36] you stood upon his word and he's seen
[34:37] you through
[34:38] amen hallelujah and we have another
[34:41] visitor brother marty
[34:44] can you raise your hand for us god bless
[34:46] you god bless you brother good to have
[34:49] you here

[34:58] and let's just create an atmosphere
[35:02] of worship um before the preacher comes
[35:04] to
[35:05] deliver the word of god

[49:08] to thank you lord that we can announce

[50:05] you for it lord
[50:06] those who are troubled in spirit lord
[50:08] you're the comforter lord you're the one
[50:10] who gives peace
[50:11] father those who couldn't make it lord
[50:12] this morning be their portion father as
[50:14] well
[50:15] lord we're just asking these things in
[50:16] your wonderful name and name the lord
[50:18] jesus christ
[50:19] amen and then god bless you friends you
[50:22] may have your seats this morning
[50:23] if i could take a uh title
[50:27] i want to speak about he cares but do
[50:30] you care
[50:30] that's the big thing do you care that's
[50:32] the big thing he cares he's proven he
[50:34] cares but do you care
[50:36] amen because if you care a man you'll
[50:38] get
[50:39] his care yeah and and if i could
[50:42] subtitle this i feel this is just going
[50:44] to go all over the place but we'll end
[50:45] up somewhere
[50:46] you know it's like a guided tour you
[50:47] sometimes why do you go here and why do
[50:49] you go here but there's a purpose i
[50:50] guess
[50:51] i mean so let's just just hold on and
[50:53] let's just you know
[50:55] anyway so and if i can subtitle this
[50:59] i want to ask you the question what does
[51:01] your care produce
[51:03] what kind of atmosphere does it generate
[51:05] because there's certain levels of care
[51:07] you know there's there's there's kind of
[51:10] a very superficial level of care which
[51:12] actually is not care but it appears to
[51:14] be care you know
[51:16] especially with the lockdown i'm sure
[51:17] you saw it going to the supermarket
[51:18] people were kind of
[51:20] keeping distance and following but they
[51:22] really just cared about themselves
[51:24] they weren't friendly you know all the
[51:25] all the friendliness just kind of
[51:26] evaporated somewhere
[51:28] you know everyone was all stressed and
[51:29] worried about things and
[51:31] you know there's no real care and
[51:34] unfortunately in this day and age there
[51:35] is very little real care
[51:38] but he cares for you but do you care
[51:41] that's the question so now i just want
[51:43] to kind of mix in
[51:45] do you care and what kind of atmosphere
[51:48] does it generate
[51:50] and now we know the atmosphere around
[51:52] around a person
[51:53] is produced by what's going on in their
[51:56] spirit realm
[51:57] so what's going on in their heart will
[51:59] produce an atmosphere around them
[52:01] someone who's tense and troubled and
[52:02] worried and full of anxiety it will
[52:04] produce a very tense atmosphere around
[52:06] them
[52:07] someone is very unforgiving and rigid
[52:09] you'll know
[52:10] you know what's going on in them by the
[52:12] atmosphere around them but someone who's
[52:14] loving and kind and thoughtful you'll
[52:16] feel that kind of atmosphere when you
[52:17] come
[52:18] into their presence so so it's really
[52:19] when i say do you care
[52:21] it's really what's in your heart i mean
[52:24] so you know we just want to just just
[52:26] kind of go through these things but you
[52:27] know
[52:28] my question today is you know do we just
[52:30] care enough to look down our nose at
[52:33] people
[52:33] who are in sin or those who are
[52:35] struggling or those who are
[52:37] self-righteous do we just have that kind
[52:38] of care that we just look down our nose
[52:40] at them
[52:41] or do we really care for their souls
[52:43] really care for their struggles and
[52:44] their hardship and what they're going
[52:46] through and
[52:46] you know we want to not just have a
[52:49] outward
[52:50] appearance of caring without really
[52:51] having a heart of care
[52:53] because remember if you care he cares
[52:56] but you've got to care first
[52:58] amen if you really care first he'll care
[53:00] for you
[53:02] i mean so now definition of care uh
[53:05] it's the provision this is just mr
[53:06] google told me so says the provision of
[53:09] what is necessary
[53:10] for the health or the welfare the
[53:12] maintenance and protection of
[53:14] someone or something so that's what care
[53:17] means
[53:18] it's also an object of concern or
[53:20] attention
[53:21] so if you care for something or someone
[53:23] it's an object of concern or attention
[53:25] you're focused on it
[53:27] because you care if you don't care
[53:29] you're not focused on it
[53:30] right so it's just like with the lord
[53:31] you know people can pretend to care they
[53:33] can come to church but it's more than
[53:34] coming to church
[53:36] it's more than reading the bible you
[53:37] know going through a religious motion
[53:39] it's not that it can appear very
[53:41] religious but
[53:42] where's the care because if it's really
[53:44] care if you really care about the lord
[53:46] you love him you want to serve him
[53:47] because he's so wonderful and good
[53:49] then he'll be your object of attention
[53:51] he'll be your object of concern
[53:53] and i'll say if he is your object of
[53:55] concern and attention then his people
[53:57] will sure be
[53:58] your object of care and care and um
[54:00] concern and attention
[54:02] and so will this dying world amen
[54:05] because really his care will manifest in
[54:07] your care
[54:12] i want you to think about it because we
[54:13] don't just want to float in
[54:16] and float out and watch the world go by
[54:18] and come to church
[54:20] and go to church and read and just you
[54:22] know but do you care
[54:24] because it's more than just learning
[54:25] things we're not here this is not a
[54:26] lecture hall
[54:27] this is not a university arena or a
[54:30] school arena or a classroom
[54:31] this is where god comes down this is
[54:34] where our faith can pull them down and
[54:35] say lord i have a needle my brother has
[54:37] a need my sister has a need my children
[54:39] have a need
[54:40] and you create an atmosphere around you
[54:42] and god can come down and meet their
[54:43] need
[54:44] it's more than just me standing here and
[54:46] talking to you i pray god would come in
[54:48] behind it
[54:49] you know i've been thinking very
[54:50] seriously we need to go higher
[54:53] we shouldn't be comfortable you say well
[54:55] we have a great church it's got to be
[54:56] more than just a great church
[54:58] i want a wonderful bunch of people more
[55:00] than that
[55:01] i say oh we all get along it's got to be
[55:03] more than that i mean we need the
[55:05] supernatural
[55:06] god i mean why did what is the cross
[55:08] meant to produce the cross is meant to
[55:10] produce god living in a people
[55:12] that's why he died for you and me not
[55:14] just our sins would be forgiven he said
[55:15] i want to dwell in my children
[55:17] i want to walk in them i want to be
[55:19] their god not that they i don't just
[55:20] want to be with them i want to be in
[55:22] them
[55:23] that's the whole purpose of the message
[55:24] that god would dwell in people
[55:26] holy and that's why we gather that god
[55:28] would dwell in people
[55:29] i mean that's why we raise our children
[55:31] to love the lord that god would dwell in
[55:33] them and that's why we care for one
[55:35] another that god would dwell in
[55:36] one another that's how harsh desires or
[55:38] not
[55:39] i want to see people filled with the
[55:41] holy ghost i have power
[55:42] powerhouse of god walking down the
[55:44] street doesn't matter if you're a mother
[55:46] or a father or a child
[55:47] i mean you're a powerhouse of god
[55:52] this is what this is said to do not just
[55:54] a bunch of rules and regulations you
[55:56] know i got a
[55:57] sub clause 5 b c d e who cares you know
[56:01] it's not just that no it's a
[56:02] relationship this is a love letter
[56:05] but you gotta fall in love with the
[56:06] author and if you fall in love with the
[56:08] author i mean you'll show you really
[56:10] care then he'll care for you
[56:11] but the question is do you care
[56:17] you know what's going to happen to some
[56:19] people they'll float in they'll float
[56:21] out
[56:21] others will take a rapture they'll keep
[56:23] floating
[56:25] and they'll realize it's been too late
[56:28] we don't just want to float be caught up
[56:30] in a church culture and
[56:32] you know say the right things and dress
[56:34] the right way and just conform
[56:35] without knowing him because we've missed
[56:38] the whole point
[56:40] we don't want to miss the point knowing
[56:42] him is
[56:43] getting the point but it's really is see
[56:46] don't look at your
[56:47] struggles we all have struggles and
[56:49] trouble but do you care
[56:52] see it's not him that falls it's him
[56:53] that gets back up
[56:55] because if you really care you'll get
[56:56] back up say lord i fail i've sinned i've
[56:58] done wrong but lord try me one more time
[57:01] i want to get up and walk with you that
[57:03] shows you care
[57:05] amen so don't look at your failures and
[57:06] how many times you fall on them just get
[57:08] back up say lord here i am
[57:10] amen it's like a boxing ring yo yo it's
[57:12] like fighting the devil in a boxing room
[57:14] just keep getting back
[57:15] up well he really just floored me with
[57:17] that one get back up
[57:19] i'm still here devil i'm walking with
[57:20] jesus
[57:22] i'm in respect of what's going on so
[57:24] don't get bowed down by oh you know
[57:26] we all fail we're human newsflash you're
[57:29] human
[57:30] you know but god is divine amen
[57:33] hallelujah
[57:34] and he gives us overcoming power
[57:36] remember it's not that him that wins the
[57:37] you know
[57:38] it's not him that wins the battle it's
[57:40] him that wins the war
[57:42] napoleon won a lot of battles but he
[57:44] lost the war
[57:45] he ended up he ended up on some island
[57:47] there in the middle of the atlantic
[57:48] wherever it was a failure
[57:50] because he lost the war i mean you take
[57:53] anyone you know great
[57:54] great people if they if they lose the
[57:57] war
[57:58] who cares about all the battles they won
[58:00] oh what about this and this no no but
[58:02] you lost the
[58:03] you lost the war we may lose battles
[58:06] we might be absolute you know wreckage
[58:09] but if you win the war
[58:11] amen amen hell louise we want to win the
[58:14] war don't we
[58:16] amen says the kind of atmosphere around
[58:18] us is produced by what's going on in our
[58:20] spirit
[58:21] many times people have issues they open
[58:23] a door and the devil comes in and just
[58:24] takes them on a crazy ride
[58:26] and if they just expose the devil for
[58:27] what he was doing then they'd be free
[58:30] i mean remember it's not it's not us
[58:31] that you know causes all the trouble
[58:33] necessarily it's him
[58:35] but if we just you know sympathize you
[58:37] know people sympathize with spirits and
[58:39] they try and you know now we're going to
[58:40] stand on the word of god say hold on
[58:43] hold on this is not you this is not this
[58:45] is not your care
[58:46] this is the devil trying to rob you or
[58:48] something i just exposed the devil you
[58:50] know i was thinking what would we what
[58:51] would happen if we came
[58:53] into this place prayed up
[58:56] under expectation confess all our sins
[58:59] to god
[59:00] not just you know and i'm not saying you
[59:02] don't do that but what if we really came
[59:04] with an expectation with a greater
[59:06] expectation
[59:08] amen we want to think about it now here
[59:12] here is um here is the account of the
[59:15] two
[59:16] uh the the pharisee and the public and
[59:19] going into the temple to pray
[59:21] it's amazing jesus all of his
[59:24] all of his um a lot of his parables is
[59:27] on relationship
[59:29] it goes beyond the outward appearance
[59:31] because he's really uh
[59:32] you know god became a man to ask the
[59:34] world do you care i care here i am i've
[59:36] proven i'm caring
[59:38] but do you and the pharisees before
[59:40] jesus came
[59:41] you'd say they really care about god
[59:44] they study the word they do all these
[59:45] things they outwardly they pray and they
[59:48] they do these great religious acts but
[59:50] when god came down
[59:53] they actually their lives proved they
[59:55] didn't care they cared about their
[59:56] religion
[59:58] but not about the lord himself so the
[1:00:01] one that they claimed to be worshipping
[1:00:02] they actually proved they didn't care
[1:00:04] because they crucified him we don't want
[1:00:06] to be those kind of people we don't want
[1:00:08] to fit into that kind of bracket
[1:00:10] i mean we want to say when god is
[1:00:11] manifested we say we care
[1:00:14] holy and because we care he cares and
[1:00:16] and manifests himself
[1:00:18] so so the parables many of them to me
[1:00:20] they reach down to the heart of people
[1:00:23] amen and he spake this parable under
[1:00:25] certain which trusted in themselves that
[1:00:27] that they were religious and despised
[1:00:29] others
[1:00:30] two men went up into the temple to pray
[1:00:32] the one a pharisee the other republican
[1:00:35] the pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[1:00:36] himself god i thank thee that i'm not as
[1:00:39] other men are
[1:00:40] extortion unjust adulterers or even as
[1:00:42] the republican
[1:00:47] i fast twice in the week i give tithes
[1:00:49] of all that i possess and republican
[1:00:50] standing afar off
[1:00:52] would not lift up so much as eyes unto
[1:00:54] heaven but smote upon his breasts saying
[1:00:56] god be merciful to me a sinner
[1:00:58] i tell you this man went down to his
[1:01:00] house justified rather than the other
[1:01:03] for everyone that exalteth himself shall
[1:01:05] be abased
[1:01:06] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[1:01:09] exalted
[1:01:10] so this pharisee cared about him it was
[1:01:13] all about him he
[1:01:14] he didn't go to the temple to worship
[1:01:15] god he went to worship himself
[1:01:17] look at what i can do look what i can
[1:01:18] achieve he didn't care
[1:01:21] but the lord cared about this publican
[1:01:23] and he went away justified
[1:01:26] so we want to go away like that i mean
[1:01:29] if we're really honest with god god is
[1:01:31] honest with us
[1:01:32] you know when you really mean business
[1:01:33] and it goes beyond what other people
[1:01:35] will think of you and you really
[1:01:36] get honest with god that's when god can
[1:01:38] come upon the scene for you
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:44] brother brahman listen uh he cares do
[1:01:47] you care
[1:01:48] when he was here on earth as i say he
[1:01:51] cared for the people so much till he
[1:01:52] healed their sick
[1:01:53] he comforted their hearts told them
[1:01:55] about a place where he would go and
[1:01:57] prepare for them
[1:01:58] and would come again to receive them
[1:02:00] unto himself he cared for them and
[1:02:02] notice
[1:02:03] he cared so much until when he knowed he
[1:02:06] must leave in order to bring this great
[1:02:07] thing to us
[1:02:09] he said i'll not leave you comfortless
[1:02:10] but i'll send the holy spirit
[1:02:12] and he shall can he shall continue my
[1:02:15] care for you
[1:02:16] until he returns there's there's no one
[1:02:19] cares like
[1:02:20] jesus knowing that his body is a high
[1:02:22] priest in a meditorial work that he's
[1:02:24] doing now
[1:02:25] that body must be in the prince of god
[1:02:27] at all times for intercession
[1:02:29] that god cannot see the sin of sin he
[1:02:31] sees only the blood of his own son
[1:02:33] aren't you glad about that and knowing
[1:02:36] that he sent back the holy spirit to
[1:02:38] continue to comfort his people does he
[1:02:40] care
[1:02:40] certainly he cares now he was to
[1:02:43] continue to care for the people
[1:02:45] his people here on earth in the same
[1:02:47] manner that he cared for them when
[1:02:48] he was here amen he says he made
[1:02:52] this directly sure i'll he will speak in
[1:02:56] my name
[1:02:57] the works that i will that that i do
[1:03:00] will you do also when he's upon you
[1:03:02] speaking about the holy ghost
[1:03:03] see he could comfort in the same way by
[1:03:06] forgiving all our sins healing all our
[1:03:08] sickness
[1:03:08] speaking to us of comfort of a kingdom
[1:03:10] that is to come
[1:03:12] see proving himself among us as god
[1:03:14] proves himself among us by
[1:03:16] jesus christ first timothy 3 16 is
[1:03:18] written this way
[1:03:19] we know about god without controversy we
[1:03:21] realize that great is a mystery of
[1:03:23] godliness for god was manifested in the
[1:03:25] flesh we saw god in flesh
[1:03:27] that was god's comfort to know that he
[1:03:30] come so much he cared for us
[1:03:32] until he became one of us god manifested
[1:03:35] in the flesh not just another person but
[1:03:37] god
[1:03:38] himself and now to make it another step
[1:03:40] closer he sends the holy spirit to care
[1:03:43] for our comforts
[1:03:44] he abides in us oh he does care
[1:03:48] amen he cared so much for us he became
[1:03:50] one of us
[1:03:51] i mean to take our sin upon himself i
[1:03:53] mean he cares
[1:03:54] he cares for the child he cares for the
[1:03:56] elderly cares for the parent who cares
[1:03:58] for the teenager he cares for all of us
[1:04:00] but the question is do you do you care
[1:04:07] this is an age of of not caring
[1:04:11] speaking of our age it would say of
[1:04:15] of the age we live in i know thy works
[1:04:17] thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:04:19] i would that thou were cold or hot so
[1:04:22] then because thou
[1:04:23] art lukewarm neither cold nor hot i'll
[1:04:26] spew the
[1:04:27] out of my mouth so what does he mean
[1:04:28] just so so you're not religiously just
[1:04:30] ice cold
[1:04:31] you're not on fire for him just kind of
[1:04:34] lukewarm
[1:04:35] just a little bit of religion here and
[1:04:36] there just you know a little bit of
[1:04:37] tepidness
[1:04:39] you know in between but god says i wish
[1:04:42] you either hot or cold
[1:04:43] because the lukewarm they can justify
[1:04:46] themselves
[1:04:47] but those who are called when i came to
[1:04:48] the lord i was lost as lost as lost
[1:04:51] could be out in the world
[1:04:52] i knew i was lost when i heard the
[1:04:54] message i had no defense i knew i didn't
[1:04:55] know him i was just honest
[1:04:57] lord i don't know you i'm lost i am i'm
[1:05:00] dead and trespassed and says lord help
[1:05:02] me
[1:05:02] i cared when i heard his word and he
[1:05:04] cared for me
[1:05:06] hallelujah but i so i had no luke
[1:05:08] warmness no kind of a bit of religion to
[1:05:10] just justify
[1:05:11] well i'm a good person i'm a christian
[1:05:13] editor i even thought i was a good
[1:05:15] person and the lord gave me a dream of a
[1:05:18] of
[1:05:18] a young man my age and he was trying to
[1:05:20] you know you know he's on a beach with a
[1:05:22] little boat he tried to push it out of
[1:05:23] the sand into the water to travel
[1:05:24] somewhere i know i've told this many
[1:05:26] times i'll tell it one more time
[1:05:27] maybe as i get older i'll tell it more
[1:05:30] you know and then
[1:05:31] but then he couldn't get the boat to
[1:05:32] move and then these couple of brothers
[1:05:34] from her family were walking down the
[1:05:35] beach and
[1:05:36] they tried to help him to get at the
[1:05:37] budget just wouldn't move so they said
[1:05:39] to him just come live with us so he went
[1:05:41] and lived with them they had a sister
[1:05:43] he married the sister then he had
[1:05:44] children then they had great
[1:05:46] grandchildren now he's an old man
[1:05:48] he's walking down the street one night
[1:05:49] it's raining he goes to cross the road
[1:05:51] slips over cracks the
[1:05:52] the back of his head on the pavement and
[1:05:54] he's dying and in my dream i'm looking
[1:05:56] down on him blood's coming out the back
[1:05:57] of his head
[1:05:58] and he says to himself i've lived a good
[1:06:00] life then he turned from a normal
[1:06:02] looking old man to a very evil looking
[1:06:03] person
[1:06:04] and all these scenes of violence real
[1:06:06] rapidly throughout his life
[1:06:08] then there was a globe and people like
[1:06:10] him walking out upon it like his
[1:06:11] descendants
[1:06:12] i don't normally have dreams like that
[1:06:13] by the way but i woke up
[1:06:15] and and the lord said to me now he
[1:06:17] thought he was good what about you
[1:06:19] so even in my rank state i was
[1:06:21] justifying but i'm a good person because
[1:06:23] i never killed anyone never shot anyone
[1:06:24] never robbed anyone didn't end up in
[1:06:26] prison
[1:06:27] but no no god kid
[1:06:31] i had no that was my defense it just
[1:06:33] evaporated
[1:06:35] because we're all riding our own eyes
[1:06:38] but i didn't have any lukewarmness to
[1:06:40] any religion to
[1:06:42] to to hide behind that's why god says i
[1:06:44] wish you are the hot or cold
[1:06:46] amen because i can work with that
[1:06:49] amen so help us lord now now now notice
[1:06:52] here verse 17
[1:06:54] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:06:56] increase with goods
[1:06:58] and have need of nothing this is the
[1:07:00] condition of of this world
[1:07:03] even even when i was in papua new guinea
[1:07:05] a few times ago you know i heard a
[1:07:07] uh it was a pentecostal church of you
[1:07:09] know a uh preacher was preaching from
[1:07:10] this verse he says look we're rich in
[1:07:12] christ with goods
[1:07:14] and in our eyes we'd say no they're not
[1:07:15] but relative them relatively to where
[1:07:17] they've come from to where they are they
[1:07:18] are
[1:07:20] right so this is around the whole world
[1:07:23] it doesn't matter if it's in this world
[1:07:24] or a developing world whatever
[1:07:26] but it says i have need of nothing if
[1:07:29] you don't need anything you don't have a
[1:07:31] lot of care
[1:07:33] right you're not worried about people
[1:07:34] caring for you or what you're careful
[1:07:35] because
[1:07:36] i'm content right we don't want to be
[1:07:39] caught up in this kind of spirit i don't
[1:07:42] really need the lord i
[1:07:43] i what do you mean i i i come to church
[1:07:45] i read the bible
[1:07:46] i go through the you know but but
[1:07:50] you know have need of nothing
[1:07:53] we have to go beyond this we can't never
[1:07:56] ever get into this kind of bracket that
[1:07:58] you don't need him
[1:07:59] i mean it doesn't matter how long you've
[1:08:01] been walking with him i mean i just i
[1:08:03] i needed more today than i when i first
[1:08:05] started the journey
[1:08:06] i needed more every day to direct my
[1:08:08] steps and
[1:08:09] guard my tongue and help me lord of
[1:08:11] everything i do i need him more now
[1:08:14] amen hallelujah but you know so i pray
[1:08:17] we never come to this state
[1:08:20] we need him amen just like sheep doesn't
[1:08:24] matter how old the sheep gets still
[1:08:25] needs a shepherd
[1:08:27] it can be the oldest ram in the herd but
[1:08:29] it still needs a
[1:08:30] still need a shepherd amen we still need
[1:08:32] a shepherd
[1:08:34] amen so because of this though there's
[1:08:38] not real a lot of
[1:08:39] genuine care he says i counsel thee to
[1:08:43] buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:08:45] what's gold tried in the fire this deity
[1:08:47] that's proven
[1:08:48] that's a revelation that's proven amen
[1:08:52] that thou mayest be rich and white
[1:08:54] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:08:56] that's the righteousness of saints
[1:08:57] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:08:59] appear and anoint thine eyes with i
[1:09:01] salve
[1:09:02] that thou mayest see amen
[1:09:06] i'm glad we can get eyes out we can see
[1:09:09] that we're not just everything's fine
[1:09:10] and dandy everything's going good no we
[1:09:12] can
[1:09:12] we actually see our spiritual condition
[1:09:15] amen we can see even if we're saved we
[1:09:17] can still see it
[1:09:18] and when given praise lord you you save
[1:09:20] me you redeem me
[1:09:21] be washed in your blood i'm a new
[1:09:23] creature hey we've got something to
[1:09:25] shout about
[1:09:26] hallelujah as many as i love i rebuke
[1:09:29] and chase and be zealous therefore and
[1:09:30] repent you want to be zealous in this
[1:09:32] hour
[1:09:33] it's it's repentance behold i stand at
[1:09:36] the door and knock
[1:09:37] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:09:39] door i will come into him and will sup
[1:09:41] with him
[1:09:42] and he with me so if you really care
[1:09:45] he's going to come in
[1:09:46] you're going to have fellowship
[1:09:48] hallelujah
[1:09:50] amen but we know the uh another problem
[1:09:52] in this age we live in is because
[1:09:54] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:09:56] shall wax cold
[1:09:57] so because iniquities are bounded in
[1:09:59] this age i mean the love of many will
[1:10:00] wax cold but so if love
[1:10:02] if if love goes cold care goes down
[1:10:06] amen but the lord has given us the holy
[1:10:08] ghost that we don't become like this
[1:10:10] i mean because the love and the care
[1:10:12] that we have is not a human love and
[1:10:14] care
[1:10:15] because human love and care is based on
[1:10:17] how you treat me
[1:10:18] right but divine love and care is not
[1:10:20] how you treat me amen is what god has
[1:10:22] done for me
[1:10:23] it's how i'll treat you hallelujah so
[1:10:25] this is what we gotta
[1:10:27] lord help us
[1:10:31] i mean i like this we're reading we uh
[1:10:33] you know we're reading through the book
[1:10:34] of corinthians as a family
[1:10:36] he says i beseech you brethren that you
[1:10:38] know the household
[1:10:39] of stiffness which is the first fruits
[1:10:42] of acacia and they that have addicted
[1:10:44] themselves
[1:10:46] to the ministry of the saints i like
[1:10:48] that word they've addicted themselves to
[1:10:50] the minister saying so
[1:10:51] they've been consumed it's been driving
[1:10:53] you see someone who's an addict they can
[1:10:55] be
[1:10:55] you know an alcoholic or a smoker or
[1:10:57] whatever a gamer whatever it may be a
[1:10:59] sports fiend whatever it may be they're
[1:11:01] addicted to the thing
[1:11:02] because the spirit of them is driving
[1:11:04] them to feed off that thing
[1:11:05] baby you become addicted you know people
[1:11:07] will you know you know people
[1:11:09] leave university because they get caught
[1:11:11] up in online gaming because they
[1:11:12] they actually they actually ruin their
[1:11:14] future basically just to play a game
[1:11:17] amen people do it you know why because
[1:11:20] they become addicted
[1:11:21] so the desire the thirst they have for
[1:11:23] the game
[1:11:24] or whatever you know actually becomes
[1:11:27] first place in their life and everything
[1:11:28] takes secondary place
[1:11:32] amen but these ones addicted themselves
[1:11:34] to the ministry of the saints
[1:11:36] i'll say the reason they did it is not
[1:11:38] that they'd get brownie points this is
[1:11:39] not
[1:11:40] this is not brownie point country this
[1:11:42] is not about brownie points you know
[1:11:44] we're not gonna walk up into heaven with
[1:11:45] a bunch of merit badges look what i did
[1:11:47] no it's lord look what you did i mean
[1:11:49] he's the one with the merit badges
[1:11:51] because because he purchased our
[1:11:52] salvation he washes white as snow when
[1:11:54] we were his enemies he reconciled us
[1:11:56] back to god
[1:11:57] hallelujah so he's the one with the
[1:11:58] browning points
[1:12:00] i'm glad it's that way otherwise it'd be
[1:12:02] a lot of pressure on me to perform
[1:12:04] and you know who would fail that'd be me
[1:12:06] so you know i'm glad it's not the
[1:12:07] pressure's not on me the pressure's on
[1:12:09] him
[1:12:09] but if your cares upon him he'll care
[1:12:11] for you amen to these ones
[1:12:14] they addicted themselves to the ministry
[1:12:16] of the saints
[1:12:18] why because they cared they cared
[1:12:23] they cared for the people's welfare i
[1:12:26] mean if they're hungry they fed them if
[1:12:27] they were troubled in spirit they'd pray
[1:12:29] with them they would you know
[1:12:30] they were they were addicted consumed
[1:12:33] and they could i believe they couldn't
[1:12:35] help but it was just their nature yeah
[1:12:36] god comes and it just changes your
[1:12:38] nature
[1:12:38] i mean it's not selfish anymore we're
[1:12:40] not worried about your problems you
[1:12:41] worry about other people's problems
[1:12:43] amen because you care
[1:12:46] hallelujah this is not a self-centered
[1:12:49] gospel
[1:12:50] right the only one that's centered
[1:12:52] around is our lord jesus christ
[1:12:54] amen but he they they addicted
[1:12:57] themselves to the ministry of saints i i
[1:12:59] pray lord
[1:13:00] in an age of self-help and youtube and
[1:13:03] everything you can do for yourself
[1:13:06] let's let's do the opposite amen
[1:13:12] you know i always preach to myself too
[1:13:13] you know you guys just maybe i'm just
[1:13:15] talking to myself and you guys are here
[1:13:18] anyway you know but
[1:13:22] we can have a greater walk we can have a
[1:13:24] greater experience
[1:13:26] individually and collectively we can
[1:13:29] have a far greater experience in the
[1:13:31] lord than we do have now
[1:13:33] why should we plateau and get
[1:13:35] comfortable
[1:13:36] i say let's let's let's go beyond the
[1:13:38] comfort zone you say i'm not comfortable
[1:13:40] doing those things the first time you do
[1:13:42] anything you're not comfortable
[1:13:44] right but then it gets it becomes a
[1:13:46] habit you get used to it
[1:13:48] hallelujah let's burst the bubble you
[1:13:51] know
[1:13:52] i'm born in july so my star sign is
[1:13:54] cancer now there is some truth to the
[1:13:56] zodiac because you see certain people
[1:13:57] born certain
[1:13:58] months of certain characteristics so i'm
[1:14:00] a crab
[1:14:02] very comfortable likes this little shell
[1:14:05] you know likes just to have his nest or
[1:14:07] as whatever they have i don't know and
[1:14:09] you're
[1:14:10] you know in the rock pool and anyway
[1:14:13] that's my nature
[1:14:14] right but the lord but the thing is you
[1:14:17] know
[1:14:18] even in your conversion god uses your
[1:14:20] nature for good
[1:14:21] there's good and bad for every nature
[1:14:24] just because okay july is the best month
[1:14:26] let's just let's just clear that right
[1:14:27] now you know i'm sorry for everyone else
[1:14:29] but you know
[1:14:30] that's all right you know it's peak is
[1:14:32] july over yeah
[1:14:34] i'm glad i got my ambient corner anyway
[1:14:35] you know
[1:14:37] no but but there's good you know one
[1:14:39] personality doesn't have an easier ride
[1:14:41] to heaven than the other
[1:14:43] right there's good and bad to all
[1:14:45] personalities
[1:14:46] and the lord wasn't surprised when you
[1:14:48] were born
[1:14:50] he wanted you with a certain nature and
[1:14:53] he wanted to use that nature for the
[1:14:54] kingdom of god
[1:14:56] i mean so you know but so i have to be
[1:14:58] but i have to be very aware
[1:15:01] that i'm a bit of a crab
[1:15:04] right one person didn't say big loud
[1:15:08] amen right there that's fine
[1:15:10] i'm glad anyway that was a silent amen

[1:15:29] walking around with a bunch of blinders

[1:16:05] very elementary today

[1:16:12] this just struck me so here i am yo i
[1:16:14] can't help but i listen something

[1:16:27] cares do you care
[1:16:29] he said he also cared for them to bring
[1:16:31] them out this is speaking of them coming
[1:16:33] out of egypt
[1:16:34] and he cared for them in the journey
[1:16:36] after they came out amen
[1:16:37] as they were in the physical this is the
[1:16:40] in the spiritual realm he cared why
[1:16:42] he provided everything they had we are
[1:16:44] yes he provided
[1:16:46] everything they had need of while they
[1:16:47] were in the journey did he
[1:16:50] he healed them when they were sick he
[1:16:53] provided healing he provided a way for
[1:16:54] their sickness he provided a bra
[1:16:56] serpent what they could look upon that
[1:16:58] bra serpent a symbol of sin and be
[1:17:00] healed
[1:17:01] he fed them while they were in the way
[1:17:03] where there was no bread he rained bread
[1:17:05] out of heaven he fed them not only that
[1:17:07] but he clothed them
[1:17:08] showing he cares for those who care
[1:17:12] amen they were they were here here's a
[1:17:14] picture of them and you know
[1:17:16] this is their condition they are in
[1:17:20] but there were there were people in that
[1:17:22] condition
[1:17:24] that they were praying we had um
[1:17:28] let's just go back let's just blank this
[1:17:29] out could we blank it out of it
[1:17:33] anyway they were in this condition they
[1:17:36] were slaves
[1:17:37] but there came a time when the word of
[1:17:39] god was going to be fulfilled
[1:17:41] and brother brown dramatizes about
[1:17:43] moses's parents
[1:17:45] and they were slaves in the field but
[1:17:47] some of them begin to care
[1:17:48] see some just got used to life while
[1:17:51] we're slaves is our portion well yes
[1:17:54] there's a promised land to go to but at
[1:17:56] some time and you know
[1:17:58] you know and they just got acclimatized
[1:18:01] they adjusted to being slaves we don't
[1:18:04] want to be adjusting
[1:18:06] anything the devil put on us right we
[1:18:09] don't want to adjust well i just you
[1:18:10] know we need wisdom and some things but
[1:18:12] in terms of being under a spiritual
[1:18:14] oppression and being bowed down and the
[1:18:16] devil telling us we're never going to
[1:18:17] make it we're never going to be
[1:18:18] christians you're never
[1:18:19] forgiven and you know you just can't
[1:18:21] overcome you're going to withstand that
[1:18:23] thing
[1:18:24] right you don't withstand there was some
[1:18:26] there that really cared because the word
[1:18:28] of god was about to be fulfilled
[1:18:30] and moses parents brother brown just
[1:18:32] dramatized it to make it a bit more real
[1:18:34] he says that amram which was moses dad
[1:18:36] he would he would come home from the
[1:18:38] fields after being beaten and whipped
[1:18:39] and hungry and whatever
[1:18:41] he'd go up into the roof of his house
[1:18:42] and call out to jehovah god and say
[1:18:44] oh god when are you going to send this
[1:18:46] deliverer oh god when are we going to
[1:18:48] leave this egypt when are we going to go
[1:18:49] to the promised land
[1:18:50] lord it's nearly 400 years amen the
[1:18:52] promise was four hundred years we've
[1:18:54] been here but he's gonna take us out
[1:18:56] almighty jehovah god the god of our
[1:18:58] fathers abraham isaac and jacob the god
[1:19:00] of joseph
[1:19:01] i mean where are you in this time of
[1:19:03] need he began to care because the word
[1:19:05] of god was about to be fulfilled
[1:19:07] and he began to call out god when are
[1:19:09] you going to fulfill the word in my life
[1:19:11] hallelujah because he cared and then
[1:19:13] eventually you know
[1:19:15] his wife said to him we're tired
[1:19:19] we've been slaves you know why do you
[1:19:21] have to do all the praying when he is
[1:19:23] let someone else pray but he had a
[1:19:24] burden see he had a bird well what if no
[1:19:27] one else prays
[1:19:28] and then eventually the angel lord came
[1:19:30] and said deliver us coming
[1:19:32] hallelujah why because he cared
[1:19:35] about the word of god being fulfilled
[1:19:38] right and because he genuinely cared
[1:19:40] about the word being fulfilled
[1:19:42] then god showed his care to abram and
[1:19:45] it's the same thing with us see it's
[1:19:46] more than just caring about
[1:19:48] you know our house or our job our
[1:19:50] education all those things we should
[1:19:51] care about you
[1:19:52] but the genuine care amen is god's word
[1:19:55] being fulfilled
[1:19:57] right if you have a genuine care lord i
[1:19:59] want to see your work manifested in my
[1:20:01] life
[1:20:01] i mean i don't just want to complain and
[1:20:03] worry about things but lord i want to
[1:20:05] see you live
[1:20:06] i mean i care lord i care i want to see
[1:20:08] you manifested
[1:20:09] i want to see you more than a story more
[1:20:11] than history i want to see this word
[1:20:12] become flesh
[1:20:14] hallelujah and he cared
[1:20:18] amen we can we can turn that back on
[1:20:22] i just want to put okay david cared
[1:20:25] about god
[1:20:27] here's a man after god's own heart
[1:20:30] and he came to a stage in his life where
[1:20:32] he had he was no longer a future
[1:20:34] he was no longer fighting a war you know
[1:20:36] but finally he was king over israel and
[1:20:38] he
[1:20:39] any any and he had his palace
[1:20:42] but his care was always about god
[1:20:46] man after god's own heart and then he
[1:20:49] would he would sit there in his house
[1:20:52] and he would speak to the prophet nathan
[1:20:54] and said and it came to pass
[1:20:56] when the king sat in his house and the
[1:20:58] lord had given him rest
[1:21:00] around about all his enemies that the
[1:21:02] king said unto nathan the prophet
[1:21:04] see now i dwell in a house of cedar
[1:21:08] but the ark of god dwelleth within
[1:21:11] curtains
[1:21:12] see it seemed that god had you know god
[1:21:14] had blessed him he was now king he had a
[1:21:16] palace all these things but
[1:21:18] his care was for the ark of the lord
[1:21:21] because to him that was the greatest
[1:21:23] thing in his kingdom it wasn't his
[1:21:25] palace it wasn't his armies it wasn't
[1:21:26] his mighty men
[1:21:27] but it was the presence of god in the
[1:21:29] nation
[1:21:30] that's what he cared about remember he
[1:21:32] was a man after god's own heart
[1:21:34] and he didn't want to be sitting in a
[1:21:35] big fancy palace where where where the
[1:21:38] ark of god will just was just dwelling
[1:21:39] in a tent
[1:21:40] it didn't seem right for him because
[1:21:42] because to the human eye
[1:21:44] people would say well david thinks he's
[1:21:45] better than the ark
[1:21:47] because look why is the ark in this tent
[1:21:48] and he's in this palace
[1:21:50] and so he wanted he wanted the people to
[1:21:52] know this is my
[1:21:53] care this is this is how i esteem god
[1:21:57] more than just a errand boy
[1:22:01] sometimes we make god an errand boy god
[1:22:03] do this and heal this one and fix this
[1:22:04] and help me here and do it
[1:22:05] and you give him a list you give him a
[1:22:07] to-do list
[1:22:09] but he's god amen that's not that's not
[1:22:13] real care
[1:22:14] that's just using him for his own you
[1:22:16] know for your own ends
[1:22:18] what about genuine care lord come live
[1:22:22] come make your abode i want to feel your
[1:22:24] presence around me
[1:22:26] i want you close i want you dwelling
[1:22:28] here
[1:22:29] i don't just want to talk about you i
[1:22:30] want to feel your presence and
[1:22:32] i want to worship you i want to create
[1:22:34] an atmosphere and i want to give you
[1:22:36] glory because you're so worthy oh i want
[1:22:38] to praise your name and
[1:22:40] hallelujah david was that kind of man
[1:22:44] amen and he would he would he would say
[1:22:47] this
[1:22:48] because he had a care
[1:22:52] because he knew that the lord dwelt
[1:22:55] between the cherubims beloved um above
[1:22:57] the mercy seat on that ark
[1:23:02] see it's the i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[1:23:04] jump forward and jump back a bit
[1:23:07] now the same care the same care came to
[1:23:11] solomon
[1:23:12] because remember god actually told um
[1:23:14] god actually told david because he's a
[1:23:16] man of war he couldn't build the temple
[1:23:18] but he would have a son who would be a
[1:23:19] man of peace and he will build that
[1:23:21] temple
[1:23:22] so now this care was now transferred
[1:23:25] down to solomon
[1:23:27] and because that because i believe the
[1:23:30] care
[1:23:30] that that david had for for god so
[1:23:33] impacted
[1:23:34] solomon's life amen david wasn't a man
[1:23:37] just to go through the motions
[1:23:40] his heart was lord i love you as a deer
[1:23:42] painter for the water brook so my soul
[1:23:44] longs after thee i want to dwell in the
[1:23:46] house of the lord forever
[1:23:47] he was an unusual man i mean but he had
[1:23:50] a heart for god god i want to be where
[1:23:51] you are i don't want to see you a far
[1:23:53] off lord you know you call out to god
[1:23:56] and have a genuine hunger and this i
[1:23:58] believe
[1:23:58] so impressed his son oh boy you think
[1:24:01] about the kind of influence we can have
[1:24:03] on someone
[1:24:04] i mean where they can see that your
[1:24:06] heart is more than you know it's more
[1:24:07] than just having a religion but
[1:24:09] they see the love you have for god the
[1:24:10] care you have for him and it can so
[1:24:12] inspire them
[1:24:14] and so now solomon came to this place
[1:24:16] where where where he was instructed that
[1:24:18] he would build this temple that his
[1:24:19] father wanted to build
[1:24:22] hallelujah amen he had a care
[1:24:27] now to me imagine this moment let's just
[1:24:29] go back there
[1:24:32] the temple's built it's time for the
[1:24:34] dedication
[1:24:36] they're going to bring the arkhan the
[1:24:38] burden of david had become the burden of
[1:24:40] solomon and now
[1:24:41] it had become material it was more than
[1:24:44] just plans on paper or parchment now it
[1:24:46] was manifested
[1:24:48] and here they would have been on that
[1:24:49] morning they were under expectation i
[1:24:52] believe they didn't know what was
[1:24:53] necessary going to happen
[1:24:54] they didn't know what would happen when
[1:24:56] the ark went into the holy of holies
[1:24:57] they didn't know but they had an
[1:24:58] expectation
[1:24:59] the same god that gave the blueprint as
[1:25:02] the same god here today
[1:25:04] and no doubt solomon would instruct the
[1:25:06] singers now you know
[1:25:08] wash yourselves be prepared be
[1:25:10] sanctified to the levites and think this
[1:25:11] is an important day
[1:25:13] we're going to have church today we're
[1:25:15] going to have church today like we never
[1:25:16] had it before
[1:25:17] i mean we're going to have a worship
[1:25:18] like we've never had it before and the
[1:25:20] musicians were all ready and they were
[1:25:22] all in their places and the people were
[1:25:23] ready and
[1:25:24] solomon was there and you know it's
[1:25:26] amazing we have here you know these
[1:25:28] these people here you can't quite see it
[1:25:29] they're they're prostrate on the ground
[1:25:31] you know here's the trumpeters and the
[1:25:33] you know you know the ones on the
[1:25:35] symbols and there and they're playing
[1:25:36] and they're ready and they're blowing
[1:25:38] their trumpets and
[1:25:39] then finally but here comes the arkhan
[1:25:42] now what is going to happen when this
[1:25:45] goes in
[1:25:46] is going to be a direct result of the
[1:25:49] hearts of these people
[1:25:52] amen it's not how shiny the symbols are
[1:25:56] it's not how clean the whatever whatever
[1:25:59] is
[1:26:00] it's not how clean their clothes are
[1:26:02] it's not how well they sing
[1:26:04] it's their hearts do they care
[1:26:08] do they care that their god gets the
[1:26:10] worship he deserves
[1:26:13] amen because remember they he brought
[1:26:15] them out of a mighty long way in the
[1:26:16] wilderness
[1:26:17] he brought them out of great affliction
[1:26:19] great trouble
[1:26:20] great strife many enemies round about
[1:26:22] them i mean they were it was it was
[1:26:25] nearly a you know a very close-run thing
[1:26:27] will they survive as a nation will they
[1:26:28] continue on
[1:26:29] and god brought them through and it's
[1:26:31] the same thing with you and i many times
[1:26:33] you say lord how are we ever going to
[1:26:34] survive this how am i ever going to get
[1:26:35] through this
[1:26:36] i've got my enemies round about with the
[1:26:37] devil's on my case what's going to
[1:26:39] happen
[1:26:40] i mean then god comes down i mean
[1:26:42] because you care for him he cares for
[1:26:43] you
[1:26:44] hallelujah and then you get through
[1:26:45] those mighty long ways in the world as
[1:26:47] you come into the land of the word
[1:26:48] hallelujah and you begin to see your
[1:26:50] enemies are come under your feet
[1:26:52] hallelujah those spirits of which ward
[1:26:54] against you now are under your feet
[1:26:56] hallelujah then and then what happens
[1:26:59] hallelujah brother jesus hallelujah
[1:27:05] so it's all now this
[1:27:08] what happens now is based on the hearts
[1:27:11] of them
[1:27:13] not on what you see on the outside
[1:27:16] that's why we could have the greatest
[1:27:17] church the perfect acoustics
[1:27:19] the the the greatest uh sound
[1:27:23] uh equipment known to man it could be
[1:27:25] perfect
[1:27:26] perfect the the greatest musicians known
[1:27:28] to man that have ever
[1:27:30] stood on two feet upon the earth we're
[1:27:31] going to have them right here
[1:27:33] the greatest singers everything but if
[1:27:35] the heart of the people
[1:27:37] if the heart of the people is not
[1:27:38] prepared if the heart of the people does
[1:27:40] not care for god
[1:27:41] it can just be a great performance but
[1:27:43] yet outwardly it could go so well we
[1:27:45] could have the
[1:27:46] most perfect preacher that doesn't
[1:27:47] stutter and and spit and slobber and
[1:27:50] jump around and whatever
[1:27:51] you know the most eloquent speech but if
[1:27:54] the heart of the people is not ready
[1:27:57] i mean we could have the most perfect
[1:27:58] families in the world but if the heart
[1:28:00] of the parents of the heart of the
[1:28:01] children
[1:28:02] amen is not prepared amen
[1:28:06] if their hearts weren't ready that would
[1:28:08] have gone in there and it just would
[1:28:09] have been it
[1:28:11] but because the heart of people were
[1:28:12] caring here comes our god
[1:28:14] we built him a house because he wanted
[1:28:17] him because he because in our human mind
[1:28:19] this is what he deserved i mean not to
[1:28:20] be intense but to be in the highest
[1:28:22] place
[1:28:23] i mean to be the most focal point of the
[1:28:24] city is the temple of god
[1:28:26] amen they and they and they took the ark
[1:28:28] in hallelujah brother andy mentioned
[1:28:30] this on wednesday then then the lord
[1:28:32] came down
[1:28:33] after the priest came out of the holy of
[1:28:34] holies aiming up they dropped the ark
[1:28:36] off
[1:28:36] and the lord came down and the ministers
[1:28:38] couldn't even minister because the lord
[1:28:40] filled the temple
[1:28:41] and then he filled the temple then he
[1:28:43] went on to the outer court hallelujah
[1:28:45] he went out there all over the prince of
[1:28:47] god amen
[1:28:48] and i say this this morning what if we
[1:28:50] came the same kind of way
[1:28:51] i mean we don't live under the blood of
[1:28:53] bulls and goats we live under the blood
[1:28:54] of jesus christ
[1:28:56] i mean we are a new creation i mean we
[1:28:58] are not like them i mean we live in a
[1:29:00] greater reality than they ever had
[1:29:02] i mean so what if we came to church oh

[1:29:06] not not we need to get right here we're
[1:29:08] already right i mean we've confessed
[1:29:10] all our faults to god amen we've poured
[1:29:12] out our heart said lord forgive me of my
[1:29:13] sins
[1:29:14] and we've made everything right
[1:29:15] hallelujah i mean there we come an
[1:29:17] expectation oh boy we'd have a different
[1:29:20] service
[1:29:21] we'd have a different service and then
[1:29:24] the devil says well he's just trying to
[1:29:26] talk it up no no no no we'd have a
[1:29:29] different service
[1:29:30] amen but we've had church for years and

[1:29:43] through a motion

[1:32:36] but it's the attitude of the people that
[1:32:37] brings the results
[1:32:39] that's the reason at pentecost they had
[1:32:41] to go up in an upper room and pray until
[1:32:42] the holy ghost come

[1:32:45] accord let's get in one place and one

[1:33:22] they all go oh no they're just as a bed
[1:33:24] we're up in glory
[1:33:26] hallelujah that's that's that should be
[1:33:28] the thrust of our life
[1:33:29] why because we're addicted to the
[1:33:30] ministry of the saints
[1:33:32] and we become addicted to it hallelujah

[1:33:55] always instant
[1:33:57] amen hallelujah
[1:34:01] amen why are you putting this on us
[1:34:04] because i believe we can do it because i
[1:34:06] believe god is here to enable us to do
[1:34:08] it
[1:34:09] remember he doesn't put something on the
[1:34:10] people and say now you figure it out now
[1:34:11] you do it in your own energy no it's
[1:34:13] god's energy
[1:34:14] let god energize the branch bring forth
[1:34:16] the fruit
[1:34:18] amen because they see it's the
[1:34:20] atmosphere that brings results you
[1:34:22] believe it let
[1:34:23] every man and woman in this building
[1:34:24] this morning boy or girl
[1:34:26] get everything from their minds but the
[1:34:27] lord jesus
[1:34:29] i mean to anything that's not the lord
[1:34:31] jesus right now kick it out
[1:34:33] i've got a lot of things to do tomorrow
[1:34:35] who cares tomorrow will take care of
[1:34:37] itself
[1:34:39] there's a lot of to-do list don't worry
[1:34:41] about the to-do list
[1:34:43] the to-do list is the lord jesus christ
[1:34:45] the to-do list is loving him
[1:34:47] hallelujah isn't he lovely
[1:34:50] let's just let's just really take stock
[1:34:53] i was lost and undone
[1:34:55] in the world who was there
[1:34:59] who remember being there didn't know him
[1:35:02] maybe knew about him maybe raised in
[1:35:04] church he wasn't real
[1:35:06] maybe some other people shout and cry
[1:35:08] and you think what's wrong with those
[1:35:09] people
[1:35:10] it just it's just embarrassing but one
[1:35:12] day
[1:35:14] but one day because he knew deep down
[1:35:16] you really cared
[1:35:18] and it went beyond your mind but he knew
[1:35:20] down in your soul you really cared
[1:35:22] then he began to brood over you he began
[1:35:24] to call you
[1:35:25] you were gonna get stirred up and you
[1:35:27] realize there's more to life there's
[1:35:29] more to the god than what i have
[1:35:30] experienced
[1:35:32] and you had a hunger and you had a
[1:35:34] longing
[1:35:35] oh leah remember remember those who are
[1:35:37] you know we can't help people
[1:35:39] pray through you've got to pray through
[1:35:41] you've got to seek god
[1:35:42] people have a burden even for years but
[1:35:45] they're keeping that burden
[1:35:46] they keep praying they keep seeking him
[1:35:49] that seeketh
[1:35:50] findeth him that knocketh not just knock
[1:35:54] hello no i'm not knocker let me in lord
[1:35:57] let me in lord of y'all you're calling
[1:36:00] me
[1:36:01] help me oh god remember he put that
[1:36:04] desire in you not to make you miserable
[1:36:06] but to bring you all the way in
[1:36:08] that's why god calls it a heart not just
[1:36:09] to make you miserable and just be
[1:36:11] convicted no god wants to bring you all
[1:36:13] the way in that's why it gives you the
[1:36:14] burning desire him that seeketh findeth
[1:36:18] keep looking
[1:36:18] amen but then eventually somehow
[1:36:22] not by your own ability when you got i
[1:36:24] remember i got to the end of myself
[1:36:26] you'd go i'm doing well and then crash
[1:36:29] and burn and you do well again it's like
[1:36:31] a roller coaster
[1:36:32] and you knew you just go down and up and
[1:36:34] down and
[1:36:35] up and then you just get sick of it
[1:36:39] lord i can't do this why because
[1:36:42] because you wonder because remember you
[1:36:44] know humans are always like well what
[1:36:45] can i do
[1:36:46] what can i do and that's the problem
[1:36:49] words go what can i do
[1:36:52] and god's like no no what have i done
[1:36:55] what have i done and and then you've got
[1:36:57] to come to say
[1:36:59] lord it's not what i can do it's what
[1:37:01] you have done
[1:37:03] and then when you just take him at what
[1:37:04] he has done then he takes you
[1:37:07] then he breaks that cycle hallelujah
[1:37:11] do you remember being in that cycle
[1:37:13] remember being in that cycle
[1:37:15] and then god pulled you out of that
[1:37:16] cycle you don't necessarily know how he
[1:37:18] did it but he did even if you didn't
[1:37:20] realize you needed more but you needed
[1:37:22] more
[1:37:23] and god found you there if we just kept
[1:37:26] those things on our minds
[1:37:28] he brought me out of the my reclaim
[1:37:32] he set my feet on the rock to stay
[1:37:36] hallelujah did he not i was nearing
[1:37:39] despair
[1:37:39] when he came to me there he told me i
[1:37:41] could be free
[1:37:43] he lifted my feet gave me glory complete
[1:37:46] when he reached down his hand
[1:37:48] for me hallelujah
[1:37:53] you say there's just a bunch of emotion
[1:37:56] this is not emotion emotion comes and
[1:37:59] goes but this endureth forever
[1:38:04] get everything from our minds but the
[1:38:06] lord jesus and believe that he's
[1:38:08] standing right
[1:38:09] present now his word says where two or
[1:38:12] three gathered in my name there i am in
[1:38:14] the midst
[1:38:16] so he's between me and you sister
[1:38:17] hannah's between me and your sister
[1:38:19] maggie between you and you and
[1:38:20] you he's right here if we were just
[1:38:23] conscious
[1:38:24] of his presence many times we're
[1:38:26] conscious of everything but his presence
[1:38:28] it's too hot it's too cold it's too loud
[1:38:30] it's too quiet let's do this
[1:38:32] you know forget it
[1:38:36] if we were conscious of his presence
[1:38:38] he's standing here
[1:38:39] right now brother says you'll see
[1:38:41] something happening
[1:38:43] that'll cause headlines in the newspaper
[1:38:45] in the morning that's right
[1:38:46] it's atmosphere
[1:38:51] i i don't believe in joking from the
[1:38:53] pulpit because the pulpits no place to
[1:38:55] joke it's a sacred place i'm quoting
[1:38:57] something and
[1:38:58] after this here mr bosworth had a very
[1:39:00] good sense of humor and he said brother
[1:39:02] branham
[1:39:03] to prove that its atmosphere said you
[1:39:05] could take a hen egg and put it under a
[1:39:07] puppy
[1:39:07] and tie him down and it will hatch a
[1:39:09] chicken see
[1:39:11] it's the warmth of the puppy's body that
[1:39:13] would hatch the chicken
[1:39:14] it doesn't have to be under the hand it
[1:39:16] could be under the puppy it could be in
[1:39:18] an incubator
[1:39:18] it's the atmosphere that's why when we
[1:39:22] come
[1:39:23] or even when you pray or you know
[1:39:26] in your own time or family prayer time
[1:39:29] whatever you do i trust you do it or you
[1:39:30] come to church
[1:39:31] you have an atmosphere of faith
[1:39:34] non-atmosphere of problems
[1:39:36] we all have problems but your faith will
[1:39:38] produce the results
[1:39:40] it's not your problem it's your faith
[1:39:42] right so we must come to him believing
[1:39:45] that he is and he's here to meet our
[1:39:47] needs and he's so wonderful
[1:39:49] and he's so good and he cares he cares
[1:39:52] for us in all of our situations all of
[1:39:54] our problems he cares
[1:39:56] hey man sophia yo he cares if we're
[1:39:58] happy if we're sad if we're troubled if
[1:40:00] we're not
[1:40:00] he cares i mentioned
[1:40:04] create an atmosphere of faith you say
[1:40:06] well we're going through this honey
[1:40:08] but i believe he's going to get us out
[1:40:10] we're going through trouble but i
[1:40:11] believe he's going to get us out of this
[1:40:13] sure the children may be doing this but
[1:40:15] i believe the lord's going to bring them
[1:40:16] back
[1:40:17] believe on the lord jesus christ for
[1:40:18] your children amen i mean so the same
[1:40:20] faith you have for yourself have for
[1:40:22] them
[1:40:22] don't look at what they're doing say no
[1:40:24] lord i claim that i believe lord you
[1:40:25] save me the same faith now i'm applying
[1:40:27] on them
[1:40:28] and i'm lifting them up before your
[1:40:29] throne saying oh god you saved me now go
[1:40:32] save them
[1:40:33] amen i i release your holy spirit upon
[1:40:35] their lives that you'll go and get them
[1:40:38] hallelujah and you lift them up before
[1:40:40] the throne it works
[1:40:42] yes i'm too discouraged no no you just
[1:40:44] look at god
[1:40:46] see the devil wants you to look at
[1:40:47] failure but look at the promise
[1:40:49] i mean the devil wants you to look at
[1:40:50] your disappointments and maybe what
[1:40:52] appears to be wrong look at the promise
[1:40:53] of god
[1:40:54] don't look at nothing else when jesus
[1:40:56] said only believe
[1:40:58] he didn't say only believe and look at
[1:41:00] the problems he said only believe
[1:41:02] so that means all you bring into
[1:41:04] consideration is your faith
[1:41:06] that he has done it amen all things are
[1:41:09] possible to them that believe
[1:41:11] only belief
[1:41:16] what are you believing in the finished
[1:41:17] work of calvary
[1:41:19] amen if the same blood washed you to
[1:41:21] wash them the same holy ghost called you
[1:41:23] to call them
[1:41:24] amen you'll be steadfast in the faith
[1:41:30] lord
[1:41:42] and if god doesn't answer your prayer
[1:41:44] he's obligated to give you an answer why
[1:41:45] not on the day of judgment
[1:41:47] amen he always answers prayer
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:52] only belief it's faith that'll do it not
[1:41:56] human reasoning
[1:42:04] now you've got to create an atmosphere
[1:42:05] and your faith will do it
[1:42:08] they were all in the upper room with one
[1:42:10] accord when suddenly there came from
[1:42:11] heaven as a sound of a rushing mighty
[1:42:13] wind
[1:42:14] the atmosphere was right it takes an
[1:42:16] atmosphere to do anything you know
[1:42:18] the regular procedure to hatch chickens
[1:42:20] is to put them under the hen
[1:42:22] but get the egg in the right atmosphere
[1:42:23] it will produce anyhow listen brother if
[1:42:25] god love
[1:42:26] if a man loves god and the right kind of
[1:42:29] an atmosphere he could get into it'll
[1:42:30] produce a newborn babe
[1:42:32] just as certain as i am here remember
[1:42:35] it's the atmosphere you create it's not
[1:42:36] necessarily oh now they're behaving now
[1:42:38] everything's gonna be just right
[1:42:40] no no no it's the atmosphere you create
[1:42:43] right remember this is not oh well these
[1:42:44] people are gonna get right then
[1:42:46] something will happen no no what about
[1:42:47] you
[1:42:47] it's the individual right it's the
[1:42:49] individual
[1:42:50] amen brother abraham says that two or
[1:42:52] three real consecrated people
[1:42:54] in a church will do more for that church
[1:42:55] than 40 revivals
[1:42:58] amen says not necessarily oh these
[1:42:59] people are doing this this is this what
[1:43:01] about us what about the individual
[1:43:03] amen who wants more than 40 revivals
[1:43:05] worth of good
[1:43:07] i say lord use me take me lord sanctify
[1:43:10] me lord
[1:43:11] for for other people's sakes not for me
[1:43:13] but for others
[1:43:15] hallelujah amen all things are possible
[1:43:17] to them that believe we're gonna have a
[1:43:18] season of a great jubilee
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:24] amen
[1:43:30] if you're ready to confess and repent
[1:43:32] and believe and accept god
[1:43:34] cares but you've got to care first
[1:43:36] you've got to accept
[1:43:38] what he sent you you'll accept the holy
[1:43:41] ghost that he sent you
[1:43:43] he so cared for them that they'd be sure
[1:43:46] that there would be no mistake he
[1:43:48] vindicated his prophet by a sign of a
[1:43:49] pillar of fire
[1:43:51] and let the people see that it wasn't
[1:43:52] just this man walking along here
[1:43:55] that's what this message is not just a
[1:43:56] man preaching god came down and proved
[1:43:58] himself
[1:44:00] hallelujah allah that it was god
[1:44:04] right above him he was the one that was
[1:44:06] leading the way god cares for people who
[1:44:08] cares
[1:44:09] god cares for those who care for him
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:12] amen let's just take a couple of people
[1:44:15] that cared
[1:44:16] i've already spoken about moses parents
[1:44:18] they cared that the word of god would be
[1:44:20] fulfilled
[1:44:21] amen and god cared for them god god sent
[1:44:23] into their own house the one that would
[1:44:25] be
[1:44:26] the deliverer amen rahab cared
[1:44:29] rahab cared for her own salvation and
[1:44:31] her own family
[1:44:32] and then when she knew jericho was under
[1:44:34] judgment they all knew that they were
[1:44:36] doomed
[1:44:36] but she cared she can't say lord
[1:44:40] there must be salvation in this judgment
[1:44:42] time
[1:44:43] i mean she cared not just for herself
[1:44:44] but for her family and she got what she
[1:44:46] needed
[1:44:47] because she cared i mean god cared for
[1:44:49] her
[1:44:50] amen one day shamgar was there in israel
[1:44:53] and the philistines were marching up and
[1:44:54] down his land and taking his crops and
[1:44:56] but one day he got enough care one day
[1:44:59] when he looked into the eyes of his
[1:45:01] of his family and they were already
[1:45:03] skinny and gaunt and the harvest had
[1:45:04] just been brought in they were going to
[1:45:06] face another winter and
[1:45:07] and then he heard the stomp of the
[1:45:08] philistines coming up the road
[1:45:12] he began to get the right kind of care
[1:45:14] and he saw the plight of his
[1:45:16] family he wasn't worried about himself i
[1:45:18] mean he's worried about the plight of
[1:45:19] his family
[1:45:20] and he began to recognize that he was a
[1:45:22] circumcised son of abraham
[1:45:24] i mean dwelling in his land hallelujah
[1:45:27] he began to recognize that and he got
[1:45:29] enough care that god cared
[1:45:31] i mean god anointed his life he killed
[1:45:32] 600 uh armed soldiers
[1:45:35] i mean why because he cared how many kid
[1:45:38] god you gave us this land
[1:45:40] you gave us this land this is your word
[1:45:41] being fulfilled i'm i'm a circumcised
[1:45:43] son of abraham i'm dwelling in my land
[1:45:45] lord i care god says i care for you sham
[1:45:49] god jumped out there with an ox god and
[1:45:50] killed 600 men
[1:45:52] hallelujah i mean when we when we look
[1:45:54] into the eyes of our children of our
[1:45:55] family our brothers and sisters
[1:45:57] and we see their plight even if they may
[1:45:59] not think they're in anything of any
[1:46:00] kind of hardship spiritually
[1:46:02] i mean but you see their need amen they
[1:46:04] say lord i care for them
[1:46:05] i'm addicted to the welfare of them
[1:46:07] hallelujah everything god will come down
[1:46:09] and show us he cares
[1:46:11] amen but you have to care first
[1:46:14] hallelujah the centurion kid
[1:46:18] he cared for his servant who was sick
[1:46:20] and nearly dying
[1:46:22] he went to the source of all health
[1:46:25] because he cared
[1:46:26] he put his care into action amen he put
[1:46:29] his care
[1:46:29] he didn't just you know console him and
[1:46:32] and feel sorry for him no no
[1:46:34] he manifested his care he went himself
[1:46:37] he went to the lord jesus and say i have
[1:46:39] a sick servant
[1:46:40] and jesus said okay i'll come i'll come
[1:46:42] pray for him he said no
[1:46:44] i'm not worthy you come under my roof
[1:46:46] but i'm a man of authority
[1:46:48] you know i tell me to go here and do
[1:46:50] this they go here and do that
[1:46:51] just like you're a man of authority as
[1:46:53] well and jesus marveled
[1:46:55] i haven't seen a faith like this in
[1:46:56] israel but because the centurion cared
[1:47:01] jesus cared and that was gentile faith
[1:47:05] that the centurion understood by jesus
[1:47:07] speaking a word
[1:47:08] was exactly the same with him physically
[1:47:10] going into the room
[1:47:11] laying hands on his sick servant amen
[1:47:14] and god has sent his word into this
[1:47:15] age hallelujah he sent his word to this
[1:47:18] age amen and we must recognize that he
[1:47:20] is present
[1:47:21] just as if he is physically present now
[1:47:23] amen in his corporal body the same one
[1:47:25] that walk the shoulder of galilee is the
[1:47:27] same god today
[1:47:28] i mean he can heal the same way he can
[1:47:29] deliver the same way he can set free the
[1:47:32] same way he can pardon the same way
[1:47:34] i mean because the same god is still
[1:47:35] walking on the earth today
[1:47:37] highly why because he sent his word upon
[1:47:39] the earth and him and his word are one
[1:47:41] see
[1:47:42] hallelujah so the centurion cared and
[1:47:44] jesus cared
[1:47:47] darius cared for his daughter sure he
[1:47:50] was a
[1:47:50] he was high up in the synagogue and they
[1:47:52] had already told everyone if you go
[1:47:54] if you guys see this jesus of nazareth
[1:47:56] you'll be excommunicated from the
[1:47:57] synagogue
[1:47:58] but then he and then so finally he's
[1:48:00] trying to keep his station among the
[1:48:02] people
[1:48:03] but then he realized what he really
[1:48:04] cared about was his daughter
[1:48:07] and sometimes god's got to get us into a
[1:48:08] place where we really got to show our
[1:48:11] colors
[1:48:12] do we care about what people think of
[1:48:14] what god thinks and he saw the plight of
[1:48:16] his daughter and he knew that there
[1:48:18] was a god of of history that it was now
[1:48:20] walking upon the earth again
[1:48:21] so he put on his preacher's kindness hat
[1:48:23] and he went out to where jesus was fell
[1:48:25] down at his feet
[1:48:26] said master my my daughter's sick he
[1:48:29] cared
[1:48:30] he went to the right source of care
[1:48:32] hallelujah and then even though when
[1:48:34] jesus was coming back with him to the
[1:48:35] house and then and a servant came and
[1:48:37] said don't trouble him no more she's
[1:48:38] dead
[1:48:39] and sometimes god will take us beyond
[1:48:41] our care
[1:48:42] because he was just expecting her to get
[1:48:44] well but now she was dead but now the
[1:48:46] great carer
[1:48:47] stepped into the house they were all
[1:48:49] crying and things he
[1:48:51] cast them all out went and just spoke to
[1:48:53] her she arose
[1:48:56] all because jarius
[1:48:59] amen cared about the welfare of his
[1:49:01] daughter
[1:49:02] hallelujah blind bartimaeus scared
[1:49:07] hallelujah he had heard about a god of
[1:49:10] history
[1:49:12] but then he realized that god of firster
[1:49:13] is now walking in front of him
[1:49:15] holy and because he really cared jesus
[1:49:18] cared
[1:49:19] amen amen now what about you and i
[1:49:22] do we really care amen do we really care
[1:49:26] or do we just care enough because we
[1:49:28] worry about what other people think
[1:49:29] about us in the church
[1:49:31] or do we really care
[1:49:35] if we really care then he will care
[1:49:41] jesus would say the kingdom of heaven is
[1:49:42] like unto a merchant man seeking goodly
[1:49:45] pearls
[1:49:46] who when he had brought found one pearl
[1:49:48] of great price went and sold all that he
[1:49:50] had
[1:49:51] and bought it why because his care
[1:49:53] rested upon the right one
[1:49:56] amen it wasn't just attack on of his
[1:49:58] life it was his entire collection was
[1:50:00] now that one pearl
[1:50:02] why because he cared is this message
[1:50:05] just to tack on to your life
[1:50:07] something you just connect on or do you
[1:50:10] really care
[1:50:12] because it's very easy to just have
[1:50:13] attack on religion and outwardly look
[1:50:15] right
[1:50:17] but where's god living god cares for
[1:50:20] those who care first
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:30] so it's the same thing with you and i
[1:50:35] he cares for us i'm just going to leave
[1:50:37] it there as i said we end up here we go
[1:50:39] this way and we end up over here
[1:50:40] somewhere
[1:50:41] but i want to leave you the same i want
[1:50:42] to leave you with the question that i
[1:50:44] started with
[1:50:45] he cares but do you really care about
[1:50:48] his word
[1:50:48] is his word the most important thing to
[1:50:50] you in your life
[1:50:52] is it really the most important thing or
[1:50:54] is just a tack on to make you feel good
[1:50:56] because you've ticked the religious box
[1:50:59] or is it the most important is it the
[1:51:02] central thing of your life
[1:51:04] because if you really care i mean then
[1:51:07] he really cares
[1:51:11] amen let's have the musicians come
[1:51:14] please don't come forward
[1:51:18] he careth for you
