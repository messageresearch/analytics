[35:36] father we want to also lift up brother
[35:38] Pedro who's still in Chile oh God he's
[35:40] speaking to a collection of Pentecostal
[35:41] churches I think in a couple of hours or
[35:43] about this time Lord I pray you'd fill
[35:45] his mouth with your word Lord I may
[35:47] speak to their hearts and set them free

[36:00] love you we submit Our Lives into your
[36:01] hands we thank you in Jesus Christ's
[36:04] name amen amen let's just before we take
[36:07] our seats we're going to read a piece of
[36:09] scripture from Mark chapter four
[36:11] and I just want to apologize I don't
[36:14] have photos and videos to to show right
[36:16] now
[36:17] um I'll put some more on the on the
[36:19] WhatsApp but I want to kind of
[36:20] incorporate the trip into this morning's
[36:24] um service because I had a real
[36:26] education
[36:27] I had a real or I had a real education
[36:29] you hear Brother Bram talking about
[36:31] certain things you said in reality it
[36:33] just it is astounding amen so Mark 4 and
[36:36] we're going to read verses 26 down to
[36:38] 29.
[36:40] um
[36:41] so this is the Lord speaking here well
[36:44] all of his Bibles I'm speaking but
[36:45] anyway it's in read and he said so is
[36:47] the kingdom of God so if a man should
[36:49] cast seed into the ground it should
[36:50] sleep and Rise night and day and the
[36:52] seat should spring and grow up and you
[36:54] know if not how for the Earth bringeth
[36:56] forth fruit of herself now notice his
[36:59] four stages of this first the blade then
[37:01] the ear then after the full layer in uh
[37:04] full corn in the air but when the fruit
[37:06] is brought forth immediately he put us
[37:08] forth the sickle because the Harvest is
[37:10] come God bless you friends you may have
[37:13] your seats uh this morning it's great to
[37:15] be back amen it's um had a had a
[37:18] wonderful time in Chile the Lord really
[37:20] blessed I believe and
[37:22] um but this is this is the thing that
[37:24] really astounded me is because we we
[37:26] really went the whole idea was burden on
[37:28] brother Pedro's heart he wanted to go
[37:29] home and and share the message with the
[37:31] Pentecostal denomination that he came
[37:33] out of and um and it's amazing because
[37:36] many of them they have long hair they
[37:37] have long you know they have skirts they
[37:39] look like us but there's a totally
[37:41] different it's a totally different world
[37:42] in terms of the liberty of the god and
[37:45] him moving in in there and you know
[37:48] brother Baron speaks about how you know
[37:50] there was the restoration of of the the
[37:53] truth right as as Jesus said you know
[37:55] unless a corn of wheat you know falls
[37:57] into the ground and dies it abides alone
[37:58] he's speaking about himself you know he
[38:00] has to be a death burial resurrection
[38:01] that now would be the life his life
[38:03] would not just be in himself but being
[38:04] as Believers right but then also that
[38:06] same process would happen down through
[38:08] the church where we go on the Dark Ages
[38:10] the church was you know buried in the
[38:12] ground but then we'll come forth on a
[38:13] reformation and a restoration and it's
[38:15] amazing when when you hear Brother Brown
[38:17] talk about it you just take it for
[38:19] granted that you know the grain is here
[38:20] again and you know there's been a
[38:21] restoration and you know there's you
[38:23] know the life has moved on from you know
[38:25] from where from where Luther was or Josh
[38:27] I live by faith the life of God was in
[38:29] that movement right but then the but
[38:31] then you know they denominated they
[38:32] formed a denomination and God had to
[38:34] raise up the wesleyans with the second
[38:35] work of Grace they took they took
[38:37] justification but they believed in
[38:39] sanctification God was restoring back to
[38:41] the original faith and you know but then
[38:43] they formed a denomination you know then
[38:44] they put a full stop behind what they
[38:45] believe in God had to move on and um and
[38:49] then there was the Azusa Street movement
[38:50] the restoration of the gifts and in in
[38:52] Chile there was a big powerful movement
[38:54] in the Pentecostal Church you know they
[38:55] but there it's interesting uh Jimmy
[38:57] could probably described better than me
[38:59] but you know it's not like here where
[39:00] you say these people are methodists they
[39:02] look a certain way and these people are
[39:03] Catholic they look a certain way and
[39:05] these people are you know what a Baptist
[39:06] but they're they all look the same
[39:09] that can look like us but they can be
[39:10] Catholic or they can be methodists and
[39:12] then the gifts and different things can
[39:13] be in the Methodist Church you know
[39:15] there's all these it's like a big
[39:17] mouthing pot of of things but there used
[39:19] to be a powerful outpouring of the Holy
[39:22] Ghost there in that country and people
[39:23] would shout and scream and speak in
[39:25] tongues and God would generally move but
[39:26] now it's because the life has moved on
[39:28] it's just a tradition you know I don't
[39:31] know if brother Isaac's watching this
[39:32] but you know Chile is the land of
[39:33] guitars
[39:35] this mandolins all kind of get there's
[39:37] like a whole whole band of people
[39:38] playing it doesn't matter what church
[39:40] you're in you know yeah I mean uh you
[39:42] know
[39:42] denominational church but they all look
[39:44] the same but there's not a liberty for
[39:46] God to move anymore see God will give
[39:48] you God will take as much as you give
[39:50] him you know he always comes where he's
[39:52] invited just like with um you know Jesus
[39:55] when Simon the Pharisee invited him to
[39:57] the feast right invited him to the feast
[39:58] Jesus knew he'd be there with unwashed
[40:00] feet made unwelcome sitting in the
[40:02] corner but he took that corner right so
[40:04] so in the Pentecostal churches they
[40:06] believe people are instruments they
[40:07] believe in the gifts that's their major
[40:09] thing and um and people seem to be
[40:11] gifted but that's all where God can move
[40:13] God doesn't move anywhere else it's just
[40:15] a total it's very it's very like okay
[40:17] now we're going to stand and we're going
[40:18] to pray for this now the young people
[40:19] are going to pray for them and now this
[40:21] person is going to pray for the country
[40:22] and they all will just repeat Glory
[40:24] adios three times
[40:25] through the service but it's all like
[40:27] it's all a traditional formal worship it
[40:30] used to be years ago people start crying
[40:32] out glory to God and the spirit of God
[40:34] will fall upon them they'd be slain in
[40:35] the spirit they'd be changed but now
[40:37] it's just been it's become a family
[40:38] tradition and you know but sincere
[40:40] people lovely people we had wonderful
[40:42] time with them humble sincere but God
[40:45] has moved on and then when we came to
[40:48] the came to the message churches it just
[40:50] felt like home
[40:51] there was a liberty because remember God
[40:53] will God will take what you give him so
[40:55] if you give him just a little bit of
[40:56] your life he'll take that but you've got
[40:58] to open every door of your heart he
[41:00] can't just be your savior he's got to be
[41:01] your Lord you've got to allow him into
[41:03] your private life brother bam says
[41:05] there's doors within the door in your
[41:06] heart so your pride you've got to let
[41:08] them into that door your private life
[41:09] God let him into that door your faith
[41:11] got to live into that door well what do
[41:13] you mean the door of faith will people
[41:14] say well I don't believe that anymore
[41:15] well that door's closed to God then
[41:17] pride is don't tell me how to change my
[41:19] life well there's a door of Pride don't
[41:20] you know who I am see and you know
[41:22] different things see private life well I
[41:23] can be whatever I want no we're
[41:25] Christians 24 7.
[41:27] Amen to these different doors and and
[41:29] he'll he'll let you in I mean he'll take
[41:31] as much as he can get
[41:33] amen so so it's very um I found it very
[41:37] interesting that way but very very
[41:38] traditional but very formal way of
[41:42] worship didn't used to be that way
[41:44] and um yes I got a very big education
[41:46] because it's more than just because some
[41:48] people think well if you've got you've
[41:49] got uncut hair and you've got a skirt
[41:51] then you must be a believer and God will
[41:52] move in power no that's just a small
[41:55] part of it that's not the life of the
[41:57] word because they all a lot of them had
[41:59] that a lot of them appreciate it because
[42:01] I shared Christine's testimony of the
[42:03] power of uncut here you know to everyone
[42:05] everyone knows those testimonies I'm
[42:06] sure maybe I'll share it anyway we're
[42:09] here you know why not but because even
[42:10] even sharing those things because
[42:12] pastors message pastors were watching
[42:13] the services when we're preaching the
[42:15] message churches then they finally
[42:16] understood the whole reason for it
[42:18] you know because we know remember
[42:20] everything we do is affected by the
[42:22] Unseen World and we affect the Unseen
[42:24] World just like when you get baptized in
[42:26] the name of Jesus Christ you're telling
[42:28] this world also Heaven and Hell whose
[42:31] side you're on
[42:32] right you are telling the Unseen World
[42:35] because remember because remember it's
[42:36] just like if I had a natural thing where
[42:38] where where we can see you're the
[42:40] wavelength of light we can see a small
[42:43] portion of it most of it's unseen right
[42:46] so it's like the world that we live in
[42:47] most of it is far greater in the Unseen
[42:49] World than in this world that we think
[42:51] we know everything about amen so I tell
[42:53] them how you know when she was in her
[42:55] late teenage years and there was people
[42:56] in the church she was in sisters were
[42:58] tempted to trim her hair and you know if
[42:59] it says it says in First Corinthians 11
[43:01] that you know that word long means to
[43:04] let grow to be uncut to have long hair
[43:06] right and then she had a dream where she
[43:08] had scissors in her hand and she'd
[43:09] probably tell us far better than me but
[43:11] you know where where she was about to
[43:13] cut her hair there were Angels around
[43:14] her pleading with her saying don't cut
[43:16] your hair because we cannot protect you
[43:18] if you do and then one of the angels
[43:21] went to First Corinthians 11 and we'll
[43:23] let's just find that and then
[43:25] you know and and read this one scripture
[43:27] to her
[43:29] but it all ties together
[43:35] First Corinthians 11 and verse 10.
[43:39] I just felt because over there they
[43:41] believe in these things the Pentecostals
[43:43] the the younger generation not so much
[43:45] but the older generation yes it says for
[43:47] this cause ought the woman to have power
[43:49] on her head because of the Angel so for
[43:51] this course what's this cause that she
[43:52] has uncut here which is long hair right
[43:54] it's not a length it's being uncut then
[43:57] she has power in her head so she's got
[43:58] protection Angelic protection on her
[44:00] because and the angels are that
[44:02] protection so so if you obey this word
[44:04] in faith because you're a Christian then
[44:06] you have the best security detail in the
[44:08] universe
[44:09] President Biden's got nothing on what's
[44:11] around you 24 7. amen
[44:14] so then I you know so I shared those
[44:16] things and then they begin to see
[44:17] actually there's a reason for it it's
[44:19] not just where you've got to follow this
[44:21] thing no there's there's a spiritual
[44:23] application Amen to the other God you
[44:26] know and then and then so she had that
[44:28] dream she didn't cut her hair right and
[44:30] then she had the dream where she was
[44:31] working her father's knife shop and I
[44:32] would we need to go there and take
[44:34] photos of the layout because I couldn't
[44:35] emphasize strong enough where she's
[44:37] standing in that shop it's impossible
[44:38] for her to escape anyone right if a man
[44:41] came in crazy with a knife saying I'm
[44:43] gonna kill you but because she had
[44:44] Angelic protection the the man could not
[44:47] kill her and then two weeks about after
[44:49] that there's a quiet afternoon this you
[44:51] know in the shop it was a public holiday
[44:53] no one was around and a man who looked
[44:55] exactly like the one in Her Dream came
[44:56] in with a knife crazy sack I'm gonna
[44:58] kill you swearing at her and so on but
[45:00] then she felt the anointing of God come
[45:01] down and the man froze and he ran out
[45:04] and then even came out came back and
[45:06] later said sorry about that lady then
[45:07] ran out again something like that AC but
[45:09] why because her hair was uncut she had a
[45:11] revelation because it's uncut she got
[45:13] Angela protection and then a couple of
[45:15] years after that you know she's walking
[45:16] down the park there in a secluded area
[45:18] of the park there's a man with a dog you
[45:20] know and they're in the past she decides
[45:22] to walk past him anyway and as soon as
[45:24] she gets to where he is there's three
[45:26] other men jump out the bushes and
[45:27] Surround her now I believe she would
[45:29] have ended up dead and she thought I'm
[45:31] in a bad position but then she then the
[45:33] Revelation came to her again her hair is
[45:35] uncut they can't touch her and the
[45:36] prince of God came down they all froze
[45:38] and she pushed the dog out of the way
[45:40] and kept walking on
[45:42] amen see see these things work if you if
[45:45] you believe the word in faith then God
[45:47] will vindicate the word in your life
[45:49] amen but even even pastors there didn't
[45:51] even understand these things when they
[45:52] heard that like Ah that's why
[45:55] see it's more than just a do and I don't
[45:56] it's that's got nothing to do with it
[45:59] amen
[46:00] so that was very powerful and I shared a
[46:02] few other testimonials and things around
[46:03] but that one I think really spoke to a
[46:05] lot of people amen but it's amazing when
[46:07] you see and you know and we were in one
[46:09] one um
[46:10] one church so I'm just gonna
[46:13] that this may be a bit of scramble
[46:15] leagues today but you know but but so so
[46:17] we spoke at five Pentecostal churches
[46:20] and then two message no three message or
[46:22] something like that anyway and so so so
[46:24] what happens there is they have a
[46:25] hierarchy in the Pentecostal Church
[46:27] where there's a pastor and he's got like
[46:28] six other churches underneath him and he
[46:30] just goes around there every soft and
[46:31] any any preachers but there's other men
[46:34] there that aren't well they just fill in
[46:36] for him when he's not there and so
[46:38] we went to one and um and and and then
[46:41] also so I should say we had what we call
[46:43] the paparazzi come around with us which
[46:46] is a husband and a wife and then another
[46:47] Young Brother they came to all of the
[46:49] services to support us and they made a
[46:51] world of difference see because you
[46:53] think look because all we did was
[46:54] basically just go through the scripture
[46:56] you know it's just like a Bible study
[46:57] just taking things like anointed ones at
[46:59] the end time you know you know the devil
[47:01] Howie made the angels fall and that
[47:03] battle came on us the battle of the mind
[47:04] all these things but they they were
[47:06] amening and they made a world of
[47:07] difference so she's never underestimate
[47:10] when you say amen and Faith to the word
[47:11] yo it can change your service it can
[47:14] change your service from just a mediocre
[47:16] one to God moving in power when you say
[47:18] Amen in faith amen sir so we call them
[47:20] the paparazzi and um and um so so they
[47:23] came to one service and um
[47:26] now because so the Pentecostal churches
[47:28] they are led by gifts they call the
[47:31] people instruments they you know and
[47:32] they have dreams and they prophesy and
[47:34] all different things and I don't know if
[47:36] it's true or not maybe some things are
[47:37] but it's all very much that way the word
[47:39] is put to one side see Jesus is in the
[47:41] corner with unwashed feet he's not he's
[47:43] not made welcome anymore because they've
[47:45] taken credential traditions and and
[47:47] they've emphasized those things above
[47:49] him so he's in the corner with unwashed
[47:51] feet and then so we went to this one
[47:53] service and we're there in the song
[47:55] service now I can't understand half of
[47:57] what's being sung but I was just there
[47:58] and I was going to preach on anointed
[48:00] ones at the end time and but that was
[48:01] just in my head it wasn't in my heart
[48:03] but I just fell in my head this is what
[48:04] and I was kind of wrestling is this the
[48:05] right thing to preach and I just saw the
[48:07] people I thought these people are
[48:08] genuine sincere they do love the Lord
[48:11] but they are bound in denominational
[48:13] slavery and I thought these people
[48:15] deserve to be free
[48:16] and um and then and then I begin to
[48:19] think about Samson being blinded there
[48:21] going into the Temple of Dagon to push
[48:22] down the pillars you know where because
[48:24] that's what brother bam said is the
[48:25] Pentecostal Church became has become
[48:27] that enslaved they dance with the world
[48:30] they've been enslaved by the world and
[48:31] the devil's put out their spiritual eyes
[48:33] and if we're not careful that can happen
[48:35] to us too we know what I mean from those
[48:37] things right I mean so so I was standing
[48:40] there saying these people deserve to be
[48:41] free Yo think in my mind then we had a
[48:43] time of prayer and I just began to pray
[48:45] Lord just once more and now now I'm
[48:46] wrestling in my mind but I'm preaching
[48:48] an anointed ones right I shouldn't be
[48:49] you know this and then and then and then
[48:51] I um
[48:52] and then Pedro's next to me says you
[48:53] know the world that the church is
[48:56] Dancing with the world just like Delilah
[48:58] was Samson was dancing with Delilah I
[49:00] thought well I'm just going to preach
[49:01] that and so I preached I I took their
[49:03] own history to prove to them where they
[49:06] had fallen from you know because because
[49:09] he you know you know Pedro explained the
[49:11] history of the Pentecostal church God
[49:12] moved in power it wasn't now let's all
[49:14] stand up and say Glory adios three times
[49:16] and sit back down God moved and power
[49:18] people's lives fear would transformed
[49:19] but now it's become a family tradition I
[49:21] use that just like brother I did with
[49:23] the Pentecostal church just to explain
[49:24] to them look you're once this but what's
[49:26] happened to you I said I'm not being
[49:28] here to be critical I say this out of
[49:29] love but what's happened you were once
[49:31] this and then there are some old people
[49:33] in the church they're agreeing with me
[49:34] they were nodding saying yes we were
[49:36] once this but what but what has happened
[49:38] for you to become this way and um and so
[49:41] and so after the service so I just
[49:43] thought well we're probably not going to
[49:45] be invited back again but the pastor was
[49:47] there and he said thank you we
[49:48] appreciated that and and there was one
[49:50] of their instruments got up and energy
[49:52] and and she said she doesn't normally um
[49:55] get up and say things at the end of a
[49:56] service but she had a dream a couple of
[49:58] weeks ago and uh in that dream Pedro and
[50:00] I were in that dream and we're in a
[50:02] church in a house and then and then and
[50:04] then also
[50:06] um so I don't have all the details
[50:07] exactly right but then she had in the um
[50:10] she said now during on this service one
[50:13] of the other instruments
[50:15] um took her and took her to the front to
[50:17] pray for her but before that happened
[50:18] the pastor's wife came and took a young
[50:20] baby off her so that could happen and
[50:21] that happened in the song service in
[50:23] this in this dream and then now in this
[50:25] dream they were actually all prisoners
[50:26] in this church and there were men coming
[50:28] from the outside an old-fashioned army
[50:30] uniforms to come and kill them and then
[50:32] she was lifted up above the church and
[50:34] she saw two columns of angels coming
[50:35] down and then she was told read Matthew
[50:38] 24
[50:40] if I can find it here one scripture
[50:42] Matthew 24 and 31.
[50:46] and then so then she read this and said
[50:48] and it says here
[50:51] and he shall
[50:53] and he shall send his angels with a
[50:55] great sound of a trumpet and they shall
[50:56] gather together his lick from the four
[50:57] wounds from one end of the Earth
[51:00] no I'm not sure if it's that one
[51:03] I might have it wrong but there's a
[51:05] scripture if it's not that one that says
[51:07] he'll send us angels in the end and
[51:08] they'll separate the weed and the tears
[51:10] right I think it's that one actually I
[51:12] think I've got the wrong scrubs just
[51:13] think about it now but that was going on
[51:16] right there
[51:18] right there but then it was interesting
[51:19] because the paparazzi when they're
[51:21] driving to that service they were
[51:22] talking and they said God will take one
[51:24] of their instruments and vindicate to
[51:27] them what was happening right now is the
[51:29] truth because that's the only way
[51:30] they'll listen and that's exactly what
[51:32] happened
[51:33] amen because because they've because
[51:36] they've placed the word to one side and
[51:38] they've taken gifts Above The Giver
[51:41] you know and we've got to be very
[51:42] careful because remember because where
[51:45] he is welcome he'll take all the room
[51:47] right so if you make the word first
[51:49] place in your life he will do whatever
[51:51] he wants and it's more than just
[51:53] prophecies and tongues interpretation
[51:55] and gifts and miracles and dreams
[51:56] whatever more but heat comes and lives
[51:58] in a very powerful way
[52:01] amen I believe it amen so so because
[52:04] remember also in this in this age where
[52:06] where brother Brown would say about you
[52:08] know taking the ladies in church age we
[52:10] know we live in that condition right
[52:11] this world is Rich and keep increased
[52:13] with Goods have need of nothing but
[52:15] don't you know you're a miserable
[52:16] wretched naked poor and blind and don't
[52:18] know it he says I stand at the door and
[52:20] knock if anyone hear my voice open up
[52:22] the door I'll come in and sup with him
[52:23] and he with me and what is that that is
[52:25] Jesus on the outside of the church world
[52:27] trying to get back in see it's the first
[52:30] time in history in the Gentile
[52:32] dispensation where he's actually on the
[52:34] outside of his religious systems we
[52:35] can't get back in because they've
[52:37] accepted creatures and traditions above
[52:38] the word of God and it was the same
[52:40] thing when we were when we were there it
[52:42] just felt like we were on the outside
[52:44] there wasn't like a welcoming spirit
[52:47] wonderful people had Great Fellowship
[52:49] had lots of last shared testimonies all
[52:51] different things with them outside but
[52:52] when we came into the church it was like
[52:53] we're trying to like we're trying to
[52:55] speak through a window like you're on
[52:57] the outside of someone's house trying to
[52:58] get their attention why because Jesus is
[53:00] on the outside of the church system amen
[53:03] but then when we went into the message
[53:04] churches like well the door was open
[53:06] he's already there why because he the
[53:08] word was had had preeminence amen so I
[53:13] was it maybe I'm not showing you I mean
[53:15] giving you the right but I trust you can
[53:17] see the difference between see we take
[53:19] for granted where we are we take for
[53:22] granted what we have that we're not
[53:23] living
[53:24] in you know living on the memory of a
[53:27] past move of God
[53:29] right because that's what they have
[53:30] sadly because God has moved on and I was
[53:32] saying to them you know saying to people
[53:34] you know if if if there's no
[53:36] denominations the Catholic Church would
[53:39] be in the message Church
[53:40] because I would have moved on that would
[53:42] have seen the era of their ways and they
[53:43] would have all just thrown out the Hail
[53:45] Marys and the sprinkling of babies and
[53:47] all the stuff that's contrary to God's
[53:48] word and they would have walked on but
[53:50] because of the spirit of denomination
[53:52] religious spirits and we said it's not
[53:55] we're not against the people
[53:57] we're not even against the church we're
[53:59] against the religious spirit in there
[54:01] that holds the people back
[54:03] so that's why brother said he so he said
[54:04] I feel so misunderstood because people
[54:06] think I'm just against their
[54:07] denomination I'm not against the the
[54:10] people I'm not against the churches I'm
[54:12] against the system that holds the people
[54:13] back amen it's exactly the same thing
[54:16] today the good sincere people but then
[54:19] they
[54:20] but then they that that spirit in there
[54:23] holds them back from who they should be
[54:25] in the in the Lord
[54:28] amen and then so we drove four hours to
[54:31] a place called Constitution
[54:32] and um there's a church there and and
[54:35] that's where I sent the um sent the
[54:38] videos and saying you know they've made
[54:40] Jesus town already
[54:41] who said you know I put that on the
[54:43] brothers and sisters now how that
[54:44] actually happened it wasn't actually a
[54:46] purpose-built village it's called
[54:48] worship Village so it's not it's not
[54:50] okay we're building a church commune
[54:51] everyone's gonna live here that's not
[54:52] how it worked the pastor felt to buy
[54:54] four acres of land now there's no
[54:56] minimum subdivision kind of thing like
[54:58] here and and and he he lived there and
[55:02] he and his wife lived on this basically
[55:03] this rock of a hill and they and for six
[55:06] years they had no power or water she had
[55:08] to go down and get the water from the
[55:10] stream and all different kind of things
[55:11] but then other people started to move
[55:13] there and so what happened is he would I
[55:15] don't know if he I come here if he gave
[55:16] it or just sold portions of land to
[55:18] people so it's now basically a
[55:19] subdivision where everyone owns their
[55:21] own property builds what they want and
[55:22] so on and then eventually they decided
[55:24] let's move the church here too so that's
[55:26] just how it evolved it wasn't like a
[55:27] we're building a commune right does
[55:29] everyone understand that yeah there's
[55:30] quite a difference between a commune and
[55:32] a let's build a subdivision happen to
[55:34] have a church there 95 of the people are
[55:36] believers so it's like Camp all the time
[55:37] it's quite it's quite neat but you know
[55:40] people you know will go to school
[55:42] different places they have jobs you know
[55:44] whatever more and but it's amazing
[55:45] because there it's a very small town
[55:48] the Constitution is not a big place you
[55:50] know in San Diego
[55:51] um San Diego
[55:52] what is it Santiago
[55:55] muchas gracias
[55:57] Santiago that's the capital rights you
[56:00] expect big churches there but in
[56:01] Constitution very small kind of small uh
[56:04] um coastal town but but it's one of the
[56:06] biggest churches in the country second
[56:07] biggest is in that place now how that
[56:09] church started is is the is the brother
[56:12] there uh Pastor Elias he was having a so
[56:16] he started you know felt there to start
[56:17] having meetings and he's having a street
[56:18] meeting and and on that day about 10
[56:22] hours before that someone got murdered
[56:25] multiple stab wounds was dead in the
[56:26] morgue and um and his family so so the
[56:30] Dead Man's family was actually in in the
[56:32] street meeting admits some of them were
[56:34] drunks and all kinds of things and but
[56:36] he was preaching and then he felt a
[56:38] voice and he thought it was behind him
[56:40] said if if I raise him from the dead
[56:43] will you follow me
[56:45] and then and then he heard that voice
[56:46] and then everyone just got on their
[56:48] faces started crying out to God and he
[56:49] didn't realize he thought it was the
[56:51] Lord speaking there behind us actually
[56:53] came out of his lips
[56:55] and then and then while he's preaching
[56:57] about those things the man was actually
[56:59] on the autopsy table
[57:00] he is about to be sliced open to have an
[57:02] autopsy and he came back to life
[57:05] and he and he ran out of the morgue and
[57:08] so now while we were there
[57:10] he was sharing testimonies because
[57:12] because so now his family is mainly
[57:15] Pentecostal so the ones who are not
[57:16] Believers but if they have a hard case
[57:19] of a disease or a sickness they bring
[57:21] them to him
[57:23] now if God is all powerful in their
[57:25] Church while they're coming to a message
[57:26] believer
[57:27] right so now so now when we're there he
[57:29] was just sharing so this is just in the
[57:31] song service now you couldn't hear it
[57:32] because it's in Spanish but he said you
[57:34] know they thank the Lord there was a
[57:36] there was a there was a there was a
[57:37] mother having a baby and the baby was
[57:39] deformed in the womb so they prayed and
[57:41] the baby was born healthy strong and
[57:42] well there was a praise report of her
[57:45] sister who had cancer now she doesn't
[57:46] have cancer and he said there's been
[57:47] multiple times leukemia all kinds of
[57:50] sickness as God is just supernaturally
[57:51] healed and people bring their sick to
[57:53] him and God God heals them
[57:56] I'll go see see I think we take for
[57:58] granted where we live you know you know
[58:00] you know where we live we think well
[58:01] we're in the message we just have church
[58:03] no this is where God's life is this is
[58:06] where the life of God the final
[58:07] manifestation of the restoration of of
[58:09] of God's word is actually here right now
[58:12] right says the grain has come back again
[58:14] amen the fruit is here now the Harvest
[58:16] is going on it's not the shook anymore
[58:18] see the Pentecostal church was the shook
[58:20] that protected the grain who knows about
[58:22] wheat anyone here you know so so first
[58:24] there's a shook grows and it looks like
[58:26] the the wheat but the wheat is growing
[58:28] on the inside then as the wheat gets a
[58:29] certain size begins to push the shook
[58:31] away then it can be in the presence of
[58:34] the Sun and ripen to become exactly like
[58:36] it was when it was planted and that's
[58:38] where we are it was a good shook God
[58:40] lived in the shop just like God lived in
[58:42] Luther's time and then Wesley's time but
[58:44] the life came up the plant right then it
[58:46] came into the head and everything became
[58:48] golden then the shook pulled away and
[58:50] then the grain became golden right and
[58:52] that's where we're living
[58:54] Hallelujah and now you've got to realize
[58:56] friends that if we're back at grain
[58:58] again
[58:59] well who is the grain
[59:01] the real believer is the grain right so
[59:04] we're made of the same material of faith
[59:06] that was planted right so we're made of
[59:08] the same material as our Lord Jesus
[59:10] Christ the only difference is he was
[59:12] born sinless and we were born in sin
[59:13] shaped and liquor he didn't know who we
[59:15] were right but in our souls we're built
[59:18] of the same material that that that he's
[59:19] made of Amen so I think we should really
[59:22] treasure and rejoice what we have don't
[59:25] just take for granted that almighty God
[59:27] has come down revealed his word he's not
[59:30] on the outside of the church trying to
[59:31] get back in right he's been welcomed
[59:33] amen he's not sitting in the corner with
[59:35] unwashed feet saying well I'll take you
[59:37] as my savior I'll take you as maybe a
[59:39] philosopher or someone's good ideas but
[59:41] I've taken you as my Lord and Savior
[59:43] You're My All In All amen and we've
[59:45] washed his feet we've made him welcome
[59:47] now he's the head of the feast amen amen
[59:49] I trust I I trust that's that's what's
[59:51] happened in your own life not just
[59:53] collectively but individually
[59:56] Alleluia so they had they had many um
[59:59] yeah so they have many testimonies of
[1:00:01] God moving in power and it was amazing
[1:00:03] man it was such an electric atmosphere
[1:00:05] in that place where it's such a blessed
[1:00:07] time with them and um yeah it was a real
[1:00:09] it was a real blessing amen and then we
[1:00:12] um
[1:00:12] and then we went back to Los Angeles
[1:00:15] again preaching some more uh Pentecostal
[1:00:17] churches and so on the Mrs Church at the
[1:00:19] end and and it was just a real blessing
[1:00:21] like this you know people came to me
[1:00:22] they said you know you've just preached
[1:00:23] my life
[1:00:24] you know questions I've had for years
[1:00:26] things I've been struggling with you've
[1:00:27] answered them they're gone you know we'd
[1:00:29] have with our fellowship with people and
[1:00:31] it was like man you just start talking
[1:00:32] and then you know things with examples
[1:00:34] will come you think where'd that come
[1:00:35] from you know you know it's just like
[1:00:37] like we're talking to
[1:00:39] um uh Jimmy's parents and they want to
[1:00:41] know about you know doing you know do we
[1:00:43] worship brother Baron these things
[1:00:44] because there's all these there's these
[1:00:45] scarecrows around see I said no there's
[1:00:48] no no we don't worship him I said it's
[1:00:50] like and this never came to me and to me
[1:00:52] I mean I was blessed by it that you know
[1:00:54] it's like it's like the eunuch there you
[1:00:56] know in the book of Acts he's going in
[1:00:58] his Chariot right and he's reading
[1:01:00] Isaiah he has no idea what it means he's
[1:01:02] reading the Prophecies of the Messiah
[1:01:03] and then and then the Lord directs
[1:01:05] Philip who knows the interpretation of
[1:01:07] that scripture to join himself to The
[1:01:09] Chariot and then now Philip says do you
[1:01:12] understand what you're reading he says I
[1:01:13] don't know unless someone teach me and
[1:01:14] then he takes that scripture and
[1:01:16] preaches Jesus Christ so now when that
[1:01:18] unit goes down into Ethiopia what would
[1:01:20] he do he'd take that he would take that
[1:01:23] prophecy he'd say Philip told me this is
[1:01:25] what it means and I Know It means that
[1:01:27] because God Vindicated in my life it's
[1:01:29] the same thing with brother Baron people
[1:01:30] say well you you know you worship no
[1:01:32] he's like Philip
[1:01:34] he shows us what this means right and
[1:01:36] God vindicates us to be true
[1:01:39] Hallelujah so so I found that you know
[1:01:41] you know things like that would happen
[1:01:42] you know people would you know but but
[1:01:43] yeah so
[1:01:45] so it really helped I mean it was a
[1:01:48] blessing all all around and it was
[1:01:50] amazing the last service that I preached
[1:01:52] in the Pentecostal churches where so so
[1:01:54] I felt to take anointed ones at the end
[1:01:55] time showing you know you can't just go
[1:01:57] by an anointing you can't go by
[1:02:00] enthusiasm you can't go by people
[1:02:02] prophesying all kinds of things because
[1:02:04] you've got to take it all back to the
[1:02:05] word the word must be number one
[1:02:08] amen you know taking like Makaya there
[1:02:10] with the 400 profits and these 400
[1:02:12] prophets of Ahab and their Prophet
[1:02:13] saying go up and take ramoth Gilead the
[1:02:15] Lord's with you I said I said you know
[1:02:16] even even even the king of the I mean I
[1:02:18] mean the leader of that organization you
[1:02:20] know took the horn you know made two
[1:02:21] horns and got all enthused and this is
[1:02:23] gonna happen and see because signs
[1:02:25] should not follow us
[1:02:27] yeah science no sorry science should not
[1:02:30] lead us
[1:02:31] signs should follow us right because if
[1:02:33] you take the profit you know if you take
[1:02:35] King Saul and David right David
[1:02:38] science followed him
[1:02:40] signs laid Saul because remember Sammy
[1:02:42] would say to him you know okay now I'm
[1:02:44] going to anoint you now you're going to
[1:02:45] go here someone's going to give you some
[1:02:46] bread and some wine you go here you're
[1:02:47] going to prophesy with these people and
[1:02:49] all these things signs led him but but
[1:02:51] he wasn't actually a man after God's Own
[1:02:53] Heart but then what happened to David he
[1:02:55] got anointed just went back to being a
[1:02:57] Shepherd now whose testimony is better
[1:02:59] outwardly think man brother Saul wow
[1:03:02] God's leading him it's amazing but he
[1:03:05] wasn't a man after God's Own Heart but
[1:03:07] then science began to follow David and
[1:03:09] those signs are actually a Vindication
[1:03:10] of who he was because remember he was
[1:03:13] anointed he was King over Israel he
[1:03:15] already was King the anointing just
[1:03:16] brought it to life so now God would
[1:03:18] vindicate he had Dominion he had
[1:03:20] Dominion in whatever Kingdom he was in
[1:03:23] the first Kingdom he was in he had sheep
[1:03:25] that was the Sheep Kingdom right lion
[1:03:27] came in beer came in and and God proved
[1:03:30] to him you are King in this Dominion
[1:03:32] because because he killed those Lion in
[1:03:33] this Bear right they could not take the
[1:03:35] sheep and then now he comes into he
[1:03:38] comes into battle there's Goliath right
[1:03:40] amen David kills Goliath why because
[1:03:42] because David was the rightful king of
[1:03:45] Israel and where the Philistines came in
[1:03:47] was actually a part of Judah which was
[1:03:48] the inheritance of David amen so so
[1:03:52] David was actually in his position in
[1:03:54] Judah enemy came into his position what
[1:03:56] happened the enemy died David lived and
[1:03:58] that was a Vindication that was a sign
[1:04:00] following him that the anointing that
[1:04:01] came upon him was you're going to be
[1:04:03] king is everyone following I made this
[1:04:05] morning I mean so science should follow
[1:04:06] us to vindicate we are the bride of
[1:04:08] Christ right God should our testimony
[1:04:11] should be a Vindication that our Lord is
[1:04:13] with us and that we're the bride because
[1:04:15] you see now where we may join us with
[1:04:17] Jesus Christ right where joint is
[1:04:18] everything he purchased on Calvary we
[1:04:20] fell there too because he's given it to
[1:04:22] us he's made us join us amen so all
[1:04:24] authority and Power in heaven has been
[1:04:26] made given unto us
[1:04:28] amen amen and as now now now you look at
[1:04:31] the authority he had amen every funeral
[1:04:34] he went to
[1:04:35] then it's their funeral remember he was
[1:04:37] lit
[1:04:37] amen he says the son could do nothing to
[1:04:40] the father shows me and what the father
[1:04:41] does the son does likewise he was led by
[1:04:43] a vision I remember death had to give
[1:04:46] way to Jesus Christ Lazarus was in the
[1:04:48] Tomb four days that that had to give way
[1:04:51] amen his rotting carcass had to become
[1:04:54] healthy strong and well he stepped back
[1:04:55] into that body and he came out of the
[1:04:57] Tomb why because death
[1:04:59] praise the Lord Death had to be subject
[1:05:02] to life
[1:05:04] I mean death is subject to life not the
[1:05:06] other way around amen because I'm
[1:05:08] talking about eternal life now amen and
[1:05:10] then he had he had dominion over all
[1:05:11] manner of sickness
[1:05:13] all manner of disease religious Spirits
[1:05:16] couldn't conquer him culture couldn't
[1:05:18] conquer him rejection couldn't conquer
[1:05:19] misunderstandings couldn't conquer him
[1:05:21] why because he's the great king of glory
[1:05:24] amen and then what happens is his own
[1:05:26] life now comes into you and I and then
[1:05:29] now God is going to remember because
[1:05:30] what happened now is they are anointed
[1:05:32] they're in the upper room right and then
[1:05:34] science started to follow them
[1:05:36] amen signs started to follow them they
[1:05:38] meant to show them that they had passed
[1:05:39] from Death unto life amen that now Peter
[1:05:43] wasn't wasn't buckling Under Pressure
[1:05:45] right of of you know you're questioning
[1:05:48] you know because remember he's saying
[1:05:49] that Jesus is being you know you know
[1:05:51] he's on trial Jesus um Peter's on the
[1:05:53] outside watching he's trying to see
[1:05:54] what's going on he's warming himself by
[1:05:56] the fire and some women come along
[1:05:57] aren't you one of them
[1:05:59] you know even your own speech betrays
[1:06:01] you that you're a Galilee and it only
[1:06:02] swears and he denies him three times and
[1:06:05] but then he said to the Lord I'm not I'm
[1:06:07] not I'll never deny you you know I'm a
[1:06:09] I'm I'm Simon I've walked on water twice
[1:06:11] I've done Mighty things you know but the
[1:06:13] thing is because it was his own but he
[1:06:16] was sincere he was genuine but because
[1:06:18] the Lord hadn't stepped into his life
[1:06:20] there was nothing to to overcome the
[1:06:23] pressure of the age right so then so
[1:06:25] then he crumbles under that
[1:06:27] but then now after Pentecost right he
[1:06:30] could stand the pressure because
[1:06:32] remember he wasn't just questioned
[1:06:33] because remember his question by a woman
[1:06:35] not even in the court on the outside and
[1:06:38] he buckled and then after Pentecost that
[1:06:40] he was questioned by the same Sanhedrin
[1:06:42] that crucified the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:45] he didn't buckle he said what should we
[1:06:47] do should we please man or God
[1:06:49] what should we do we're going to please
[1:06:50] God we're Christians here that's what we
[1:06:52] do amen so he didn't Buckle under a far
[1:06:55] greater pressure than he did on a far
[1:06:58] lesser pressure what had happened
[1:06:59] because that was actually a Vindication
[1:07:01] that he had passed from Death unto life
[1:07:03] amen and brother Branham uses uses the
[1:07:06] example of when he is there and his you
[1:07:08] know hope has died his first wife has
[1:07:10] died and his little baby Sharon Rose is
[1:07:12] is dying of the same disease right and
[1:07:16] then and then so what happens is of
[1:07:17] course the Devil comes along because he
[1:07:19] always comes in moments of weakness
[1:07:20] right remember if you're tired of you're
[1:07:23] feeling you know down he comes to you
[1:07:25] then
[1:07:26] that's why that's why what you should do
[1:07:28] is you should turn the sign on your door
[1:07:30] saying actually business is closed come
[1:07:32] back when business hours are open don't
[1:07:34] talk to me now devil you've come at the
[1:07:36] wrong time and actually I have power to
[1:07:37] tell you to shut up and go away but
[1:07:39] anyways comes you in weakness and stress
[1:07:41] and problems that's when the Devil comes
[1:07:42] he doesn't come when you're on the
[1:07:44] Mountaintop rejoicing he always comes in
[1:07:46] a moment of weakness right amen but you
[1:07:48] see now
[1:07:50] here was here was the you know yo so so
[1:07:52] here was here was Peter right he
[1:07:54] overcame now Jesus no brother Brown was
[1:07:56] there and his and his brother I'm sorry
[1:07:58] his his his baby is dying and he's
[1:08:02] praying with all his heart Lord please
[1:08:03] may not take her and he just sees this
[1:08:05] black sheep come across like he's God's
[1:08:07] not going to answer the press and the
[1:08:09] Devil comes along and says I thought he
[1:08:10] said he was a good God
[1:08:11] I thought you said he loved you I
[1:08:13] thought you said he's a Healer you've
[1:08:14] told many people he's a Healer you know
[1:08:16] and that he's a god of love and mercy
[1:08:18] and look what he's doing to you
[1:08:19] and then brother bear because he's in
[1:08:21] his last points when the devil came he
[1:08:23] said I was about to agree with him but
[1:08:26] then something came up with him he said
[1:08:27] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:08:30] blessed be the name of the Lord and what
[1:08:32] was that and he always came back to that
[1:08:34] that that that that that quickening
[1:08:36] power of the Holy Ghost was in him he
[1:08:38] always came back to that to show him the
[1:08:39] Darkest Hours god holds on to us not us
[1:08:42] holding on to God Amen he showed us
[1:08:45] because that was I've never been in that
[1:08:47] position that would have been a horrible
[1:08:49] position to be in but yet brother Brown
[1:08:51] would take it back to that saying
[1:08:53] actually no the Lord has done a work in
[1:08:54] my life he's changed me that when
[1:08:56] pressure comes on he comes on the scene
[1:08:58] to to that I can overcome what the devil
[1:09:02] does see many times we're looking at Big
[1:09:04] Miracles and things that's a miracle
[1:09:06] yeah Hallelujah that's a great miracle
[1:09:09] when the enemy comes along like that and
[1:09:10] you say and he said I was about to agree
[1:09:12] with him because everything he said was
[1:09:14] true then something came up with him he
[1:09:16] said the Lord gives the Lord takes away
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:19] Hallelujah so now you see signs begin to
[1:09:21] follow the Believers
[1:09:23] proving to them that the Dominion that
[1:09:26] their lord had now is in them over all
[1:09:28] sickness and diseases
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:31] over everything and it should be yes we
[1:09:34] should look back in our lives and say
[1:09:35] the things that once bothered us
[1:09:37] tormented us ruled Our Lives those
[1:09:38] Spirits they don't rule us anymore
[1:09:41] amen that we should go from glory and to
[1:09:43] Glory that it shouldn't be that that
[1:09:45] it's not our emotions anymore that lead
[1:09:47] us it's not memories and scars and hurts
[1:09:50] and pains and trouble and Trauma you
[1:09:52] know God wants to use those things you
[1:09:54] know God doesn't waste anything in our
[1:09:55] lives he wants to use it but you're
[1:09:57] gonna be willing to give it to him you
[1:09:58] see it's just like in the Old Testament
[1:10:00] there were six Cities of Refuge right
[1:10:02] that uh you know that someone who you
[1:10:04] know you know they committed
[1:10:05] manslaughter was a mistake or something
[1:10:07] they could run in there right they had
[1:10:09] to get in there before the Avenger of
[1:10:11] blood got them right like a family
[1:10:12] member who could who could who could
[1:10:13] settle the score but once they got in
[1:10:15] there they could let off the pressure
[1:10:16] because their case would be heard and
[1:10:19] they are safe once they got in the doors
[1:10:21] right but the seventh is always a
[1:10:23] mystery the seventh just like you know
[1:10:24] there were you know Jesus at the Feast
[1:10:26] of you know winning Feast of Cain
[1:10:27] remember there are six six water pots to
[1:10:30] be filled but he was the seventh right
[1:10:31] six Cities of Refuge the seventh is
[1:10:33] Christ himself amen just like the
[1:10:35] seventh seal is Christ himself returning
[1:10:37] to the Earth winding up his plan Amen to
[1:10:39] the seventh is always a mystery
[1:10:41] hallelujah amen so now the seventh is
[1:10:44] Christ now now a lot of those Cities of
[1:10:46] Refuge they were once they want
[1:10:49] strongholds of the enemy in the land
[1:10:51] just like Caleb he took one of them it
[1:10:53] was a malachite City or whatever it was
[1:10:55] right they see so so what happens is the
[1:10:57] devil puts pain in our lives and that
[1:11:00] can become a stronghold
[1:11:02] where they're thinking can can so
[1:11:04] traumatizer and trauma's real right
[1:11:06] remember we're all human
[1:11:09] I've got some I've got some people I'm a
[1:11:12] person too right trauma is a real thing
[1:11:15] okay so there's no I'm not diminishing
[1:11:17] anything that's happened to in our lives
[1:11:18] okay so don't get me wrong but if we
[1:11:21] allow the devil to Harbor that thing
[1:11:23] that thing will make us live in a way
[1:11:25] that normally we would not live that way
[1:11:27] if it wasn't there
[1:11:28] right you take a you take a enemy City
[1:11:32] your enemy soldiers are coming up
[1:11:33] they're raiding other places they're
[1:11:35] causing havoc and trouble and all
[1:11:36] because they're in that city right if
[1:11:38] you took away the city and you took away
[1:11:40] them there wouldn't be that trouble
[1:11:42] right so now what God does is he wants
[1:11:44] to use those things and turn them into
[1:11:46] actually a blessing where it's no longer
[1:11:48] a stronghold that's why the Bible says
[1:11:50] we've got to cast down strongholds right
[1:11:52] don't allow strongholds to build in our
[1:11:54] lives well how do they start building
[1:11:55] how's the how's the foundation build
[1:11:57] well you allowed that situation to make
[1:11:59] you bitter instead of better
[1:12:01] right it comes with a choice amen so so
[1:12:04] it starts with that okay and then and
[1:12:05] then the enemy can get into that wound
[1:12:07] right and then he began to project
[1:12:09] himself in our lives to our families and
[1:12:11] all these things we think man what is
[1:12:13] going on here it's not the person it's
[1:12:14] that Spirit has gone into their Spirit
[1:12:16] doesn't mean we're not Believers either
[1:12:18] by the way
[1:12:19] right because remember the enemy has a
[1:12:21] right to inflict us with sickness he has
[1:12:23] a right to to to to get into our spirits
[1:12:25] but he can't get into our souls a means
[1:12:28] if God has stepped down into your soul
[1:12:30] amen you've been turned from unbelief
[1:12:32] into Faith what's happened God has
[1:12:34] stepped in amen so now what happens is
[1:12:36] now is is the nature of your soul has
[1:12:39] changed right and then now so now that
[1:12:42] changes the nature of your spirit
[1:12:44] amen but then what happens is the enemy
[1:12:47] can get into your spirit and start
[1:12:48] causing trouble but it depends who you
[1:12:50] surrender to see but then now we often
[1:12:53] wonder why on Earth did that happen to
[1:12:54] me well God wants to use it
[1:12:56] you know God wants to use it as a
[1:12:58] powerful testimony amen because now
[1:13:00] Caleb comes in it was an enemy City now
[1:13:03] it becomes a City of Refuge in the
[1:13:04] promised land amen where God can you
[1:13:07] know man can run into that testimony and
[1:13:10] be safe they can be healed they can be
[1:13:12] redeemed it's the same thing with you
[1:13:13] and I it's just like brother brownie
[1:13:15] said you know when his baby was dying
[1:13:16] Sharon Rose her eyes would cross over in
[1:13:19] pain and then he said
[1:13:21] every cross-eyed child that came across
[1:13:23] the platform what came to his mind his
[1:13:26] own his own daughter
[1:13:27] so he could now enter into prayer for
[1:13:30] that child because he had walked that
[1:13:32] way before
[1:13:34] I mean to God use it as an immense he
[1:13:36] said every cross-eyed child never left
[1:13:38] cross-eyed
[1:13:40] and but but but they never knew the pain
[1:13:43] and anguish
[1:13:44] that God allowed him to go through to
[1:13:46] get to that spot that he could enter
[1:13:48] into their prayers and God could deliver
[1:13:50] them
[1:13:51] but what happened it could have been a
[1:13:52] Philistine Garrison it could have been
[1:13:53] it could have been just a wound it could
[1:13:55] have been a stronghold of the enemy in
[1:13:57] brother Brown's life but he gave it to
[1:13:59] God and it became actually a City of
[1:14:01] Refuge we could enter into someone's
[1:14:03] burden pray for them I mean we could all
[1:14:05] pray for a cross-eyed child but but it's
[1:14:08] far different if you've been there
[1:14:09] before
[1:14:10] so you can actually step into that
[1:14:12] burden far more because many times we
[1:14:13] just sympathize right but if but but but
[1:14:16] if you've been in that before then you
[1:14:18] can really relate and you can really
[1:14:19] pray like no one else can and that's why
[1:14:21] we have every different testimony under
[1:14:23] the sun right here right Hallelujah
[1:14:25] someone walks in these doors they think
[1:14:26] no one will understand me here just hold
[1:14:28] on just come for lunch a few times you
[1:14:30] know let's have some fellowship people
[1:14:32] were going to open up and say this is
[1:14:33] where I'm from this is what happened to
[1:14:35] me but God brought me out and then they
[1:14:37] can bring it to realize I'm not a
[1:14:38] special case
[1:14:39] Hallelujah actually God has delivered
[1:14:42] them and if he's delivered them he can
[1:14:43] deliver me
[1:14:45] Hallelujah so what is that now so that's
[1:14:48] a sign following
[1:14:50] amen that's powerful if God has brought
[1:14:53] you somewhere from somewhere into into
[1:14:55] this present truth transformed your life
[1:14:57] you're a living miracle and that's why I
[1:14:59] said to the people over there I said you
[1:15:00] know we rejoice in cancers and things
[1:15:02] being healed but actually the greatest
[1:15:03] Miracle you ever see is a soul converted
[1:15:06] that was once dead and trespasses and
[1:15:08] sins given their life to the Lord being
[1:15:09] transformed by us Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] that's a miracle so when you get up in
[1:15:13] the morning you brush your teeth you
[1:15:15] live you're actually looking at a living
[1:15:17] miracle
[1:15:19] Hallelujah wait you are the miracle amen
[1:15:23] you are a living Miracle every day you
[1:15:25] live in this earth you're a living
[1:15:26] Miracle amen because you know sadly
[1:15:29] sadly this world is falling apart right
[1:15:31] Chile is falling apart they have the
[1:15:33] same problem sure it's not first world
[1:15:35] like here but you know you know there's
[1:15:37] economic pressures prices have gone up
[1:15:39] the value of the currency has gone down
[1:15:41] wages haven't gone up to reflect those
[1:15:43] things they have all the troubles we
[1:15:45] have
[1:15:45] and I said to them it was funny Pastor
[1:15:48] Elias you know he's saying everyone
[1:15:49] should move to New Zealand
[1:15:51] in the service and then I said in the
[1:15:54] service you know New Zealand's falling
[1:15:55] apart too
[1:15:56] and I listed all the trouble you know
[1:15:57] one of the highest suicide rates in the
[1:16:00] world all mental health has gone
[1:16:01] skyrocketing prices have gone up wages
[1:16:03] haven't gone up things are families have
[1:16:05] fallen apart all these things and they
[1:16:07] said to me after the survey said you
[1:16:08] know you're kind of wise I tried to get
[1:16:10] everyone to move to New Zealand and then
[1:16:12] you said it's not that great so they're
[1:16:14] going to stay here he said he actually
[1:16:16] said I tried to get rid of them man
[1:16:17] that's hilarious man
[1:16:19] but you know
[1:16:21] the world is falling apart
[1:16:23] but why are we not falling apart why our
[1:16:26] family staying actually getting stronger
[1:16:28] why is the love between husband and
[1:16:31] wives and between children why is the
[1:16:33] family unit getting stronger
[1:16:35] it's not it's not mental ability
[1:16:38] it's not because you're in a self-help
[1:16:40] book or you went on a YouTube
[1:16:41] clipping you know it's not well I'm
[1:16:43] deciding our family's going to be better
[1:16:45] no it's actually because we are
[1:16:47] beneficiaries
[1:16:48] we are beneficiaries of the resurrection
[1:16:51] of our Lord Jesus Christ and that and we
[1:16:54] know really that is the message of the
[1:16:56] hour
[1:16:57] right so when you receive this word see
[1:16:59] he's not on the outside trying to get
[1:17:01] into your life but you actually open the
[1:17:02] door because remember that that
[1:17:04] scripture there in Revelation is not
[1:17:06] just the church level it can also be in
[1:17:07] the individuals too because it says if
[1:17:09] any man hear my voice
[1:17:10] see and we've heard his voice in this
[1:17:12] day you open up your heart he comes in
[1:17:14] you have communion now
[1:17:16] hallelujah what happened because now you
[1:17:18] become a beneficiary
[1:17:19] amen of the open Word of God in this day
[1:17:22] and then so now our lives don't fall
[1:17:24] apart
[1:17:26] like the world
[1:17:27] sure we may have times have have times
[1:17:29] of great distress and trouble we're not
[1:17:31] immune to those things right but God
[1:17:33] will see you through those things see we
[1:17:35] have we have a way of Escape you know
[1:17:37] you know the Bible says you know if
[1:17:39] there's any trial or Temptation you look
[1:17:40] for the way of escape and he is the way
[1:17:42] of Escape amen and he wants to show us
[1:17:44] right he wants to show us something in
[1:17:46] the trial see aren't you so glad I'm so
[1:17:48] thankful you know we're not just
[1:17:51] but you know you know it's all the grace
[1:17:52] of the Lord right we understand we're
[1:17:54] only in this message by Grace right we
[1:17:56] could be in some charismatic Pentecostal
[1:17:58] church somewhere amen being sincere with
[1:18:00] all our hearts you know and and sure God
[1:18:02] will bless you a little bit in there but
[1:18:03] you know but he's brought us into
[1:18:05] present truth
[1:18:06] he's brought us into present truth you
[1:18:09] know
[1:18:09] I'm so thankful that we're not looking
[1:18:11] backwards but we're looking forward
[1:18:15] you know where where we see you know
[1:18:18] you know it's like sadly
[1:18:21] many have made
[1:18:22] Christianity a family tradition
[1:18:25] you know we don't want him to become a
[1:18:27] family tradition you know I wish I could
[1:18:30] take you to Chile and show you the
[1:18:32] contrast and then even even
[1:18:34] um Jimmy's parents saw the contrast you
[1:18:36] know and then one of the biggest things
[1:18:37] that spoke to to his mum was the young
[1:18:40] people worshiping
[1:18:42] she said that showed me there's such a
[1:18:45] liberty in here because in the
[1:18:47] Pentecostal Church you just kind of
[1:18:48] stand there there's no yo some don't
[1:18:50] even believe in clapping of hands or
[1:18:51] anything you know it's very very rigid
[1:18:54] like a Catholic Church in a way you know
[1:18:56] we're going to do this now stand up and
[1:18:57] pray this everyone stand up and say
[1:18:59] Gloria adios and now we're going to pray
[1:19:00] for this and do yes like a system of
[1:19:02] religion there's no Liberty where you
[1:19:04] know God can move and so I wish I could
[1:19:06] take you there and show you that then
[1:19:08] take you to among the message people and
[1:19:11] say man this is a day and night contrast
[1:19:13] we're actually among you know because
[1:19:16] because even his mom said where the
[1:19:18] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:19:20] right amen and I'm so thankful it's not
[1:19:23] because of us or anything we've done is
[1:19:24] because no what happened because because
[1:19:26] you know brother Brahm says if you want
[1:19:28] to see deity in your midst if you want
[1:19:30] to see God himself in your midst welcome
[1:19:32] and receive the word amen if you want to
[1:19:35] see him he says I wonder if we're
[1:19:37] sufficiently impressed by a deity which
[1:19:39] is in our midst are we sufficiently have
[1:19:41] we been sufficiently impacted Amen to
[1:19:44] think God has stepped out of History he
[1:19:47] was once bound at the doors of
[1:19:49] denominations by Creeds and dogmas but
[1:19:51] now the end time message because we've
[1:19:53] been restored back to the truth has has
[1:19:55] loosed the Holy Ghost
[1:19:56] I mean I'll share the testimony there
[1:19:58] you know housing last time I was in New
[1:20:01] Guinea and you know you know you know
[1:20:02] Papua New Guinea there's over 800
[1:20:04] languages and I was at a convention
[1:20:05] there's about people from 40 different
[1:20:06] places you know so at least 40 languages
[1:20:09] were sitting in that church and and I
[1:20:11] said this message restores us back to a
[1:20:13] true Pentecost of Acts chapter 2. and
[1:20:15] when I was preaching on those things The
[1:20:16] Interpreter stopped interpreting because
[1:20:18] everyone understood in their own
[1:20:20] language I had no idea what was going on
[1:20:22] I was just preaching away I thought he
[1:20:24] was interpreting I was just there but
[1:20:26] after the service people you know
[1:20:27] pastors who are like because they're you
[1:20:29] know you know some of them are very
[1:20:30] stoic
[1:20:31] they're like you know this one brother
[1:20:33] he's from he's from the base of the
[1:20:35] tallest mountain in Papua New Guinea
[1:20:36] where it where it snows up there Mount
[1:20:38] Wilhelm you know you know he says you
[1:20:40] know with our young people we take up
[1:20:41] the mountain we train them
[1:20:43] we train them I don't know what that
[1:20:45] training entails but oh boy but anyway
[1:20:47] after that service he came to close in
[1:20:49] prayer and he was just weeping over the
[1:20:51] pulpit never seen him do that before in
[1:20:53] my life but he was so moved and then
[1:20:55] they told me what was you know what
[1:20:57] happened
[1:20:58] I say it does because in Acts chapter 2
[1:21:00] the day of Pentecost everyone understood
[1:21:01] in their own language
[1:21:03] see
[1:21:04] so we don't have just we're not
[1:21:07] following a religion we're following the
[1:21:09] resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:21:11] amen that is here to change us into the
[1:21:15] image of his word amen that we can
[1:21:17] become true Bible Christians amen I'm so
[1:21:20] thankful that you know
[1:21:22] that God is so mindful of us
[1:21:25] you know that it's not us you know it's
[1:21:28] not us trying to be anything it's what
[1:21:29] the Lord has already said you know
[1:21:30] because the reason the reason he's
[1:21:32] brought us into the truth is because we
[1:21:34] are green
[1:21:35] right we are grain yes we are the fruit
[1:21:39] amen and it's not because of the color
[1:21:41] of this or the age of this or how smart
[1:21:43] or the top two inches in my case is
[1:21:46] definitely lesson two here you know it's
[1:21:49] not about no it's a seed that God
[1:21:51] planted by foreknowledge right he looked
[1:21:53] through time he saw you he says I'm
[1:21:55] going to predestinate that person and
[1:21:56] spy for knowledge and it doesn't matter
[1:21:58] what we came out of
[1:22:00] hey man it's it it's the seat on the
[1:22:03] inside you know saying to the people
[1:22:05] there you know it's like you know you
[1:22:07] know our our past can be so real
[1:22:09] and you know Abram had Ishmael we know
[1:22:12] that hey and so so Abraham but but then
[1:22:15] he became Abraham and we know the reason
[1:22:18] that you know a name represents a life
[1:22:20] right it's when God changes the name he
[1:22:22] showing a change in life and so Abraham
[1:22:25] and Sarah
[1:22:26] Sarah was changed to Abraham and Sarah
[1:22:30] and in the Hebrew that H represents the
[1:22:33] Breath of God
[1:22:34] so when he changed the names from
[1:22:35] Abraham to Abraham there's an H winning
[1:22:37] there from Sarah to Sarah and H he's
[1:22:39] representing now the Breath of God Has
[1:22:41] Come unto these people and changed their
[1:22:43] lives now when Jesus was there
[1:22:45] there before Pentecost before he before
[1:22:47] he ascended he breathed on his disciples
[1:22:49] saying receive ye the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:51] they did in the upper room so there was
[1:22:53] actually so the Holy Ghost really is the
[1:22:55] Breath of God comes unto you now the
[1:22:57] life of God and changes our nature
[1:22:59] changes our lives and then so now now
[1:23:02] Abraham has Isaac but then God says to
[1:23:06] Abraham take your son your only son and
[1:23:09] take him you know but you think now hold
[1:23:11] on
[1:23:12] God made a mistake this Bible's wrong
[1:23:15] because there's Ishmael Ishmael probably
[1:23:18] even looks like Abraham he would he'd
[1:23:21] probably talk a bit like him have the
[1:23:23] same mannerisms well as Abraham right
[1:23:25] but he was Abraham's son he wasn't
[1:23:28] Abraham's son so when God spoke to
[1:23:31] Abraham and said take your son your only
[1:23:33] son he was exactly right because that
[1:23:35] man Abram was dead
[1:23:38] he may have been living in the same
[1:23:39] house Abraham and Abraham looked the
[1:23:41] same but one had died and now a new man
[1:23:44] had come forth because remember we are
[1:23:46] not a patched up people we're not a
[1:23:48] reformed people hallelujah we are
[1:23:50] transformed we are new creatures in
[1:23:53] Christ Hallelujah like it says in
[1:23:55] Revelations it says about our age he
[1:23:58] says he's the beginning the author of
[1:24:00] the creation of God
[1:24:02] right wait let's just let's just read
[1:24:04] that shall we
[1:24:05] hey man it's so good to be home
[1:24:08] Hallelujah
[1:24:09] but you know it's like we get used to
[1:24:13] the atmosphere we live in
[1:24:15] you know if we went up Mount Everest too
[1:24:17] quickly we would die because not used to
[1:24:20] the atmosphere because there's a way
[1:24:21] thinner yo there's way less oxygen up
[1:24:24] there same same same Earth but different
[1:24:26] oxygen because it's lower precious less
[1:24:28] but if you slowly went up the mountain
[1:24:31] you'd slowly acclimatize as you went up
[1:24:34] right it's the same thing with you and I
[1:24:36] we may have been raised in church but
[1:24:38] there comes a time when God comes and
[1:24:40] speaks to our hearts and what happens is
[1:24:42] we begin to live in a different
[1:24:43] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost actually
[1:24:44] the word becomes alive you see people
[1:24:46] scream and shout you under what's going
[1:24:47] on with those people but then you have
[1:24:49] the same experience you know you realize
[1:24:51] that God's grace is amazing amen because
[1:24:54] it falls on you and then so now you step
[1:24:56] into a whole different atmosphere
[1:24:58] then because you because we once we're
[1:25:00] all dead and trespasses and sins right
[1:25:03] doesn't matter how much we were we may
[1:25:04] have been had our first nappy here in
[1:25:06] this church you know but we all need to
[1:25:09] meet him right so so it doesn't matter
[1:25:11] oh I'm in the message that doesn't
[1:25:13] really mean anything
[1:25:14] it's like saying I live in New Zealand
[1:25:16] what does that mean you know it doesn't
[1:25:18] make you anything you know but you have
[1:25:20] a
[1:25:21] we have to have a personal encounter
[1:25:23] with the Lord ourselves right then what
[1:25:25] happens is it once and didn't trespasses
[1:25:26] and sins we once were actually ruled by
[1:25:29] the prince of the power of the year the
[1:25:30] Bible says right but then when we give
[1:25:32] our lives to the Lord because he pulls
[1:25:34] on our hearts what happens is he breaks
[1:25:35] that yoke of the enemy and then now we
[1:25:37] walk in units of life with the Lord
[1:25:39] right when he fills us with us holy
[1:25:41] ghost who's who's following me amen and
[1:25:43] then now we realize
[1:25:45] the air is way better up here you know
[1:25:47] this is way different to living down in
[1:25:49] the dumps of sin I'm I'm living where
[1:25:51] the air is air is um you know pure you
[1:25:55] can see for
[1:25:56] eternity to Eternity before I can just
[1:25:58] see small doing rubbish burning and all
[1:26:01] those things but see
[1:26:03] and you're actually in shock you've been
[1:26:05] you're here now you're here
[1:26:08] well that that was my experience man I
[1:26:09] can't believe I was that and you think
[1:26:11] man how did I even think how did I even
[1:26:13] used to be who was that person I don't
[1:26:15] want to find out I'm just I'm glad I'm
[1:26:17] not that guy anymore but then what
[1:26:19] happens is we get used to where we live
[1:26:20] and we take for granted what we have
[1:26:22] because you come acclimatized we
[1:26:25] shouldn't become just acclimatized we
[1:26:27] should treasure
[1:26:29] what we are not and what we are what we
[1:26:32] are not we're not sinners
[1:26:34] right brother Brown says that many times
[1:26:35] we make a mistake and we think we have
[1:26:37] to get saved all over again don't do
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:40] see you know for some reason we think oh
[1:26:43] we've got to go back to the start again
[1:26:44] give our lives a new and start again no
[1:26:46] no no no don't do that
[1:26:47] right if the Lord has met you and
[1:26:49] changed you
[1:26:51] cannot be unchanged right if he's really
[1:26:53] done a work in your soul you cannot be
[1:26:55] unchanged you have your ups and downs
[1:26:57] sure but you won't be you don't be
[1:26:58] coming you don't go back and become lost
[1:27:00] again
[1:27:01] right so but what do you do just repent
[1:27:03] and move on with God right make it right
[1:27:06] if you've got to make it right with
[1:27:07] someone make it right move on with God
[1:27:08] don't don't hold on to condemnation
[1:27:11] right we're not meant to carry those
[1:27:13] things let go of it
[1:27:16] Hallelujah
[1:27:17] amen praise the Lord oh yeah where were
[1:27:20] we oh yeah Revelations three yep that's
[1:27:21] where we go
[1:27:33] amen so just verse um verse 14.
[1:27:36] have a going for time
[1:27:38] all right verse 14.
[1:27:46] it says and unto the angel of the Church
[1:27:48] of the later sians right these things
[1:27:49] saith the amen
[1:27:51] the faithful and true witness the
[1:27:53] beginning of the creation of God now if
[1:27:56] we if you actually look into that that
[1:27:57] beginning is the author of a new
[1:27:59] creation
[1:28:00] and that's exactly what we are God has
[1:28:02] made us a new creation remember we are
[1:28:05] not a patched up creature he is the
[1:28:08] author of the new creation of God and
[1:28:11] that's what he did that's what he's done
[1:28:12] in our lives see we're not the old
[1:28:14] creation patched up we're actually
[1:28:16] totally New Creations
[1:28:18] I mean that's why we're telling that's
[1:28:20] why we think different that's why we act
[1:28:21] different talk different you know
[1:28:23] because we're different people
[1:28:25] just like Abraham was once Abraham but
[1:28:28] then he then God breathed into him and
[1:28:30] he became a new creation just like Sarah
[1:28:33] she became a new creation I mean in
[1:28:35] Genesis 18 when when when God had a
[1:28:38] visitation with her according to time of
[1:28:39] life you're going to have the promised
[1:28:40] son amen so where once she was doubting
[1:28:43] and being frustrated and all these
[1:28:44] things at the promise you couldn't do it
[1:28:45] in her own strength but then when God
[1:28:47] came down gave her that visitation she
[1:28:49] then judged him faithful
[1:28:50] of whom had promised it says in Hebrews
[1:28:52] 11 amen and when you judge him faithful
[1:28:55] what's that you're actually because God
[1:28:56] has done a work in your life I mean you
[1:28:58] no longer frustrated and and being
[1:29:00] annoyed at God's promises not seemingly
[1:29:02] being fulfilled but you judge him
[1:29:03] faithful that he can do that which he
[1:29:05] has promised and then what happens we
[1:29:07] you can just praise him all day even
[1:29:09] because remember faith faith looks
[1:29:10] beyond what you see Hallelujah we don't
[1:29:13] look at what we see right now what we
[1:29:15] hear with our ears what we feel in our
[1:29:17] spirits and our emotions we look to the
[1:29:18] promise of God Amen so we can look
[1:29:21] beyond what we see it doesn't matter
[1:29:22] what people say it doesn't matter no
[1:29:24] we've got to take that person and say no
[1:29:26] that person is part of the promise I
[1:29:28] mean you take prodigals whoever it may
[1:29:30] be they are part of the promise of God I
[1:29:32] mean our children actually must receive
[1:29:34] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:35] Hallelujah because Jesus because Peter
[1:29:38] said and I can say Jesus said because
[1:29:40] Peter spoke through Jesus spoke through
[1:29:41] Peter right he said repent be baptized
[1:29:43] every one of you amen for a mission of
[1:29:45] sin in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:29:47] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:48] the promises to you and to your children
[1:29:50] those who are far off as many as the
[1:29:52] Lord Our God shall call right so so
[1:29:54] really if you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:29:55] your children have to
[1:29:58] Hallelujah I mean we can just take it
[1:29:59] that simple because it's all part of the
[1:30:01] same promise Hallelujah so you know but
[1:30:04] if we look at what we see we can be
[1:30:06] discouraged but don't look at what you
[1:30:08] see look with eyes of Faith to what you
[1:30:10] should really be seeing amen which is
[1:30:12] the promise of God Amen that's why Jesus
[1:30:15] said only belief
[1:30:16] only belief so that means don't believe
[1:30:19] in reason
[1:30:20] that means that you know that doesn't
[1:30:22] mean believe and look at the
[1:30:24] circumstances right because hope brother
[1:30:26] Bible says is the greatest enemy faith
[1:30:27] has see Hope and Faith both believe the
[1:30:30] promise
[1:30:31] but Faith doesn't look at circumstances
[1:30:33] hope does
[1:30:34] right so don't look at the circumstances
[1:30:36] because that's hope and that can
[1:30:38] actually he says it's the greatest enemy
[1:30:39] faith has this hope right many people
[1:30:42] hope it's going to happen I hope the
[1:30:43] word is true and hope you know that the
[1:30:45] promise will be fulfilled don't look at
[1:30:47] it with hope say Lord change my hope
[1:30:49] into faith
[1:30:51] a man that doesn't matter see because
[1:30:52] hope doesn't look at circumstances hope
[1:30:54] looks only at no sorry Faith looks only
[1:30:56] at the word faith does not look at the
[1:30:58] circumstances I feel like I just made a
[1:31:00] big mess of that
[1:31:02] Faith takes the word only
[1:31:04] hope
[1:31:05] does as well takes the word but it takes
[1:31:08] circumstances as well takes what the
[1:31:11] five senses declare so it's the enemy of
[1:31:13] Faith right so just only belief
[1:31:16] amen because all things are possible to
[1:31:18] them the belief Hallelujah so
[1:31:23] you know brother Brian said that the
[1:31:24] Pentecostal move was a great shook it
[1:31:27] protected the grain real well but it
[1:31:29] pulled away why did it pull away because
[1:31:31] the word came
[1:31:33] and declared himself right Jesus Christ
[1:31:36] stepped out of history and said here I
[1:31:38] am I am the resurrection and the life
[1:31:39] this is what my word really says this is
[1:31:41] who I really am and they had a choice
[1:31:43] either hold on to Traditions or walk
[1:31:46] with God right and it's the same thing
[1:31:48] with Israel when they came out of Egypt
[1:31:50] they had to follow the pillar of fire
[1:31:51] all the way into the promised land amen
[1:31:53] and that same Pillar of Fire was there
[1:31:55] with the Apostle Paul Amen in Acts
[1:31:57] chapter 9 he saw a great Shining Light
[1:31:59] there on the road to Damascus and that
[1:32:00] was Jesus returning his Pillar of Fire
[1:32:02] and he spoke to Paul amen because
[1:32:05] because Paul said who are you Lord he
[1:32:07] says I am Jesus whom you persecute who
[1:32:09] is he persecuting the church well who
[1:32:12] was in the church Jesus how did he get
[1:32:14] into the church he came as a pillar of
[1:32:15] fire into the upper room separate
[1:32:16] himself into the uh into the 120 right
[1:32:19] so now the people had to follow the
[1:32:21] pillar of Fire they couldn't just stay
[1:32:24] they had to follow the word as he
[1:32:27] unfolded himself right so through the
[1:32:29] writings of Paul even Peter said you
[1:32:31] know the things that brother Paul says
[1:32:32] are hard to understand and many wrestle
[1:32:34] with them and the scriptures to their
[1:32:35] own destruction so even Peter had the
[1:32:37] Revelation that what Paul was saying was
[1:32:39] actually scripture right so we don't
[1:32:41] want to wrestle with the word will say
[1:32:42] Lord I don't hey I don't understand this
[1:32:45] whole thing
[1:32:46] right this is an eternal book
[1:32:48] amen If we're honest we say Lord you
[1:32:51] know it's like when I was studying
[1:32:52] science at University one of the
[1:32:54] lecturers said you know the more you
[1:32:56] think you know it's actually you realize
[1:32:58] the more you don't know
[1:33:00] because it actually unlocks so many
[1:33:01] things you know oh yeah I've got this
[1:33:04] all down packed and then you learn
[1:33:05] something more it just like opens a big
[1:33:07] vast areas like man I have no idea
[1:33:09] really what's going on it's the same
[1:33:11] thing with God right yeah amen he opens
[1:33:13] his word and you think man praise the
[1:33:15] Lord I know that much but it just opens
[1:33:16] up a whole thing like when the seals
[1:33:18] come open Amen to you and you realize
[1:33:20] actually it's not four horse riders only
[1:33:22] in Tribulation and the Jews and all
[1:33:24] those things it's actually the lamb
[1:33:25] coming forth to redeem you
[1:33:27] amen it changes your whole man the whole
[1:33:30] world just I mean the whole Bible just
[1:33:31] opens up
[1:33:33] Hallelujah amens let's just keep walking
[1:33:35] with God but we have to keep following
[1:33:37] the pillar of Fire
[1:33:38] right the the lutherans see see Martin
[1:33:41] Luther I'll say this in a you know as an
[1:33:43] example he was in the Catholic church
[1:33:44] but he saw the pillar of fire move the
[1:33:46] Josh shall live by faith he followed it
[1:33:47] that far but then the Lutheran stopped
[1:33:49] and the pillar fire moved on Weasley
[1:33:51] John Weasley actually he actually heard
[1:33:54] the commentary of Martin Luther on the
[1:33:56] book of Romans being read he said he
[1:33:57] felt a warming in his heart he was a
[1:33:59] minister he had already gone to America
[1:34:01] and tried to preach he miserably failed
[1:34:03] he came back to England then this
[1:34:04] happened it transformed his life what
[1:34:06] happened is the messenger of the
[1:34:07] previous age wrote that commentary and
[1:34:09] and by reading that by him hearing that
[1:34:11] amen Faith came transformed his life
[1:34:14] what happened he saw the pillar of fire
[1:34:16] move it's not just a Joshua live by
[1:34:17] faith it's not by Good Works it's by
[1:34:19] faith alone in Jesus Christ you're
[1:34:20] Justified but also we live a holy life
[1:34:22] as well and he followed the pillar of
[1:34:24] Fire right and then the Pentecostal saw
[1:34:27] us more than just the Joshua live by
[1:34:28] faith you know and you know living a
[1:34:30] holy life but God's power should be back
[1:34:32] in the church there should be Divine
[1:34:34] Healing and gifts and all those things
[1:34:35] they saw the pillar of fire move they
[1:34:37] followed it but then when Malachi 4 is
[1:34:40] come and open open the word the full all
[1:34:41] of Jesus Christ has been restored they
[1:34:43] had the decision as well are we gonna
[1:34:45] follow the pillar of Fire
[1:34:47] or we're gonna stay here
[1:34:48] right God came now to fully restore his
[1:34:52] truth hallelujah and here we are the
[1:34:55] beneficiaries of that
[1:34:57] amen so let's I'm I might just finish
[1:35:00] that there it's kind of like a half of a
[1:35:02] hash of a trip report but what a blessed
[1:35:04] time
[1:35:04] and the Lord undertook in not just
[1:35:07] preaching and things but also
[1:35:09] um having fellowship with people people
[1:35:10] said I had questions for years now my
[1:35:13] questions are answered had no idea what
[1:35:14] the questions were just explaining
[1:35:15] things and talking you know having
[1:35:16] fellowship and you know people said I've
[1:35:18] been struggling with things for years
[1:35:19] but now that struggle's over
[1:35:21] God did God did things like that so it
[1:35:22] was a real blessed time I thank you so
[1:35:24] much for your prayers and because
[1:35:25] remember if one of us goes like that
[1:35:27] we're all connected with that person
[1:35:29] going right so it's not just me going
[1:35:30] but it's actually we are all represented
[1:35:32] in that same with
[1:35:34] um Andy and Dave down in Dunedin so
[1:35:35] thank you for your prayers you know the
[1:35:37] Lord really was good and I just flew in
[1:35:39] yesterday but I feel okay so praise God
[1:35:41] as well thank you for your prayers too
[1:35:43] amen but aren't aren't you thankful
[1:35:46] where God moves on we don't just stay in
[1:35:49] in the shadow but we walk with him
[1:35:51] something in US is like Joshua right
[1:35:54] something in Joshua and Caleb because
[1:35:56] remember the pillar of fire move Moses
[1:35:57] called Israel out but something in them
[1:35:59] said it's more than just being here by
[1:36:01] Sinai and complaining of the desert the
[1:36:03] pillow fire is going to move and take us
[1:36:05] into the promised land and they walked
[1:36:07] with the Lord until they until the lord
[1:36:09] gave them their inheritance and you're
[1:36:10] glad God puts up because God put
[1:36:12] something in them to do it they weren't
[1:36:14] smarter than the other spies they
[1:36:15] weren't you know better or whatever
[1:36:17] something God deposited something in
[1:36:18] them to say what that man is saying with
[1:36:21] those Ten Commandments is not him but
[1:36:22] it's God speaking and now we can take
[1:36:24] the land because God says it's ours
[1:36:25] we're just going to go fight for it but
[1:36:26] God is going to give us a land and they
[1:36:28] walked with the pillar of fire and
[1:36:29] possessed their promises and aren't you
[1:36:31] thankful we're the same amen that it's
[1:36:33] not just God's end of prophet and you
[1:36:35] know long hair and dress and baptism and
[1:36:37] one God and serpent seed but there's
[1:36:39] more than that but the whole word of God
[1:36:41] has opened up that now every Divine
[1:36:43] promise that he has given us
[1:36:45] we can inherit
[1:36:47] amen and we just walk as he leads us in
[1:36:49] his word we walk with him like that it's
[1:36:51] amazing
[1:36:52] I wish I could take you to one of those
[1:36:54] Pentecostal churches find people
[1:36:56] humble kind generous all those things
[1:36:59] but yet unfortunately they're living in
[1:37:01] the past
[1:37:02] and that Spirit has bound them like that
[1:37:04] I pray God the God just break the
[1:37:06] shackles and they'll come into the
[1:37:08] fullness of the word of God
[1:37:10] amen because remember we're not against
[1:37:12] gifts
[1:37:14] some people think you have one or the
[1:37:15] other no spirit and Truth
[1:37:17] we must worship Jesus once filled to
[1:37:19] worship and spirit and truth so we can't
[1:37:21] just have the truth without the spirit
[1:37:22] right and you can't just have the spirit
[1:37:24] without the truth which is the word we
[1:37:25] need both running together and I believe
[1:37:27] by God's Supreme Grace we have that and
[1:37:30] may we ever stay humble and thankful and
[1:37:34] appreciative
[1:37:35] that for whatever you know God's Grace
[1:37:38] has found us and he'll keep us and let's
[1:37:40] just keep walking on and love Everyone
[1:37:42] don't ever look down on anyone say
[1:37:44] humble love everyone out in the world
[1:37:46] wherever because remember as God found
[1:37:48] you
[1:37:49] right you didn't find yourself
[1:37:52] and just because you know just because
[1:37:54] that person hasn't been found it doesn't
[1:37:55] mean they won't be found
[1:37:57] amen so let's prayerfully find that last
[1:38:01] one so we can all go home
[1:38:02] they might be here somewhere you never
[1:38:04] know
[1:38:05] let's just love the Lord and this yeah
