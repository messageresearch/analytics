[22:42] [Music]
[22:45] how wonderful
[22:47] I wondered this morning driving here if
[22:51] there would be any testimonies today I
[22:53] think it's been at the wilds and we had
[22:55] a little open mic and some taste so many
[22:58] times so if you want to take your seats
[23:00] and I'll just ask that question this
[23:05] morning if there's any testimonies and
[23:07] in my heart I was expecting our Minister
[23:10] to be back brother bin and I was thought
[23:12] he would bring something wholesome Foss
[23:16] and I still think he would he's gonna so
[23:20] yeah I'll just I'll just open up will
[23:22] we'll have a little one hand out mic
[23:25] ready for there we go
[23:27] really for any testimony I see a hand
[23:30] god bless you brother hump off oh we've
[23:34] got the poop at my going as well so yes
[23:41] I mean god bless you
[23:45] I'm just hoping that brother man it's
[23:48] recording there so that brother Ben can
[23:50] also have a share of the testimony I
[23:53] will try not to be long but the
[23:57] testimony is about my car
[24:01] well let me say our family car not mine
[24:05] it's a family car and I I just want to
[24:10] say that you know everything that
[24:13] happens in the life of a believer
[24:17] whether is a physical thing or you
[24:19] perceive it as a spiritual thing or you
[24:23] perceive it as a physical thing it has
[24:26] got some spiritual implications and that
[24:30] is why that is what I want to base this
[24:32] testimony on that in as much as it was
[24:35] the vehicle that we were trying to bring
[24:38] from South Africa to here but there were
[24:41] some strong and spiritual influences or
[24:48] changes or things that the Lord wanted
[24:50] to do
[24:51] at least in my life or in my family life
[24:54] amen
[24:55] we we we planned to bring the card from
[24:59] South Africa to here and then we looked
[25:01] at the shipping company we call
[25:03] quotations and we booked it in and then
[25:06] from the very first day that the cow was
[25:08] supposed to be picked up in Johannesburg
[25:10] to Cape Town
[25:11] because Joanna's back is inland there
[25:13] were problems from the onset from the
[25:16] first moment you know there were
[25:18] problems so the car was supposed to be
[25:20] picked up on the 3rd of January it was
[25:24] not picked up it was picked up sometime
[25:27] I think in February or late and it was
[25:29] picked up late at night everything was
[25:31] just late Late Late Late and I even
[25:34] thought for a second that perhaps we
[25:38] took a wrong decision to try to bring
[25:40] the car here but little did I know that
[25:43] the Lord wanted to do something that
[25:45] will go way beyond just the car in my
[25:49] life amen
[25:51] taken it went to Cape Town it stayed in
[25:54] Cape Town for more than four weeks it
[25:58] was it was jumped by the shipping
[26:02] companies that were supposed to pick it
[26:04] up from the harbour one of the reasons
[26:09] was that there was just a stop at one
[26:12] time that the car was supposed to be
[26:14] picked up and loaded into their ship it
[26:16] was not picked up they said the ship
[26:18] could not even come into Cape Town the
[26:20] car was left second time they took cars
[26:24] and other like cargoes that came even
[26:27] after our car they took ours was left so
[26:32] you know those kind of things that to
[26:33] come and you pray and you ask God
[26:35] questions and you start to ask questions
[26:37] and the cars only picked up later and
[26:40] then there it left and then now I was
[26:44] started to worry the integrity of the
[26:47] shipping company I was worried about
[26:48] because I didn't trust him now I was not
[26:52] sure whether I must pay them or I
[26:53] shouldn't pay them will the car ever be
[26:55] here then the devil brings many things
[26:58] at the time that some ships some
[27:00] shipping cargos was lost
[27:01] some people lost
[27:03] how are some people lost cars and then
[27:05] the devil start to really come and be
[27:07] the tool that God created him to become
[27:10] in your life and he started to really
[27:12] come and you know work on me I think God
[27:16] was trying to do something in the end I
[27:18] saw that God was doing something then
[27:21] the car came it went all the way via a
[27:24] gr Singapore you know you can track it
[27:26] on the internet and you can see the next
[27:28] thing we were checking then we couldn't
[27:30] trace the car we couldn't we couldn't
[27:31] see where the car is we've got no idea
[27:33] there's no reception of GPS nothing
[27:36] because just somewhere in the middle of
[27:38] the ocean and you don't know when it is
[27:43] at that time when now you pray and say
[27:46] Lord you know I need this car and you
[27:49] are the one but the devil said no this
[27:51] was not supposed to come in the first
[27:53] place don't you remember
[27:54] then the devil reminds you things and he
[27:56] preaches to you he is at a time when you
[27:59] know you he makes you forget what the
[28:03] Lord said to him that no it is written
[28:05] it is written and you forget and we we
[28:09] spend so much time praying for that car
[28:11] until I I was studying to be worried and
[28:15] that's why the devil wants you he wants
[28:17] to stress you he wants to to to work on
[28:21] you on your faith to a point where you
[28:23] will start to doubt God and as long as
[28:25] he can get you there
[28:26] that's his will and as long as you
[28:29] cannot give him the the podium or to
[28:31] listen to him that is your win the
[28:33] Prophet says and look you can get
[28:36] worried you can get stressed you can get
[28:39] and whatever I want to be but the
[28:42] question is is that going to help you
[28:44] huh is that going to bring the solution
[28:48] towards your problem the answer is no so
[28:52] why then stress the Prophet says it only
[28:55] causes you diseases whether spiritual or
[29:00] physical it only brings more trouble for
[29:02] you to worry
[29:03] so if worrying cannot help you it can
[29:06] only bring worse then why do it that was
[29:09] one of the challenges that I had so okay
[29:11] the long and short of it and we check
[29:16] the car
[29:16] again we could see it now is in
[29:18] Indonesia Indonesia Australia Australia
[29:21] Auckland upland it arrives here the
[29:25] local agent who was supposed to help me
[29:27] he's the guy who'd never even call you
[29:29] you call him send him an email only then
[29:33] he can give an update all of a sudden
[29:35] the guy started to be the one calling me
[29:38] not me calling him and I said maybe the
[29:41] Lord is doing something here our
[29:43] excitement when the car arrived in
[29:45] Auckland It was as if our kai has
[29:47] arrived here it arrived in Wellington
[29:50] we're so happy clearing I knew that the
[29:54] MPI customs are going to to send the car
[29:59] for the second order you call the second
[30:01] inspection where you pay extra money it
[30:04] took it didn't even take the only stir
[30:07] weekend when when brothers wants two
[30:10] brothers and sisters West Auckland so
[30:13] the car was cleared in less than 24
[30:16] hours they did not even intended for the
[30:19] secondary inspection I said my the Lord
[30:23] is answering and we're so happy we
[30:25] praise Him we worship Him we thank him
[30:27] for answering our prayer but we never
[30:29] realized that no we are not there yet
[30:32] when on took the luggage send a car in
[30:36] for registration that this was this was
[30:39] the pic now of my trial or personally my
[30:42] test for really to trust in God in every
[30:46] little detail what God does he does not
[30:49] do things in my country we say God does
[30:53] not cook and have me have me half
[30:56] million or half baked cake he prepares
[30:59] something to the end sometimes you have
[31:02] arrived you are to the edge to the very
[31:05] edge where you think I thought here I'm
[31:07] going to fall please help me he says no
[31:09] you are not going to fall just trust in
[31:10] me he says now I'm saying on the edge
[31:13] you are looking at the court you know
[31:15] you are looking you say Lord I'm going
[31:17] to fall he says no that's come he wants
[31:20] you to the very edge so that you can put
[31:22] your trust in me I'm trying to make you
[31:24] think about being on a high mountain on
[31:26] the very edge here is a four
[31:30] and youth he says no just raise your
[31:33] hands don't try to hold just leave
[31:36] everything in my hands he brings you
[31:38] there then the car came gave them papers
[31:43] give them everything all of a sudden of
[31:46] something that we never thought about
[31:48] they said they want something called a
[31:50] statement of compliance man that became
[31:55] a weight that I hated to hear because
[31:59] back in South Africa our Kaiser GM a
[32:03] vacant South Africa GM has left our
[32:05] shores so they don't operate the South
[32:08] Africa anymore

[32:11] to hear the name GM because they left
[32:13] the country people lost jobs the economy

[32:21] products are upset so you told GM they
[32:23] don't want to listen to you call South
[32:26] Africa I call my dealer call everyone

[33:12] know what it took the longest time in lo
[33:14] had then the whole time it lives on
[33:17] Africa that's where my faith was really
[33:21] tried and then it went on to and fro
[33:26] sending emails everywhere we praying
[33:29] every night I think I even brought my
[33:31] request here so many times that we must
[33:33] pray for our car then it happened one
[33:37] day that my wife just said you know what
[33:38] this car was made in Thailand I can hear
[33:41] you I think he didn't know that I called
[33:43] Thailand
[33:44] she just sent an email to the very same
[33:46] people that are contacted after an email
[33:49] that says Miss damper we cannot help you
[33:52] she send an email to them
[33:55] those guys they said okay send up the
[33:57] details of the car she sent the details
[34:00] and then they within four hours they
[34:03] replied with the document I was like
[34:07] what I thought I was dreaming because I
[34:12] called them and I've got an email saying
[34:15] here's the email this gave us the
[34:18] documents within 24 hours and they they
[34:21] did not sign the documents send an email
[34:24] back that please this must be on the
[34:26] letterhead signed and authorized by a
[34:28] designated person they did that and they
[34:31] send it to us as if all this time there
[34:36] was no problem then we send it to lower
[34:41] hutt then the car was registered so the
[34:44] longer showed about it is that the Lord
[34:48] have got a solution to every big or
[34:50] small problem that you have it is not
[34:54] about the problem the issue is not about
[34:56] the problem the issues about you and
[34:59] your faith in God so he can bring
[35:02] anything to trust you to ensure that
[35:05] when the devil comes before him to say
[35:07] ah but I don't poke does not trust in
[35:09] you that the Lord can confidently say no
[35:11] devil you a liar go and test you the
[35:13] Lord ones dead it's not about food or
[35:16] job or car or anything but he uses those
[35:18] things to try and ensure that in the end
[35:22] spiritually there is a positive results
[35:25] so I just want to give God the glory and
[35:27] the honor because the guy is here but
[35:30] after all it was not about their car it
[35:32] was about us and I'm happy that the Lord
[35:35] achieved what he wanted to achieve and
[35:37] that he can only take us from that point
[35:39] to higher levels through other
[35:41] temptations one of my favorite codes I
[35:43] like to talk about brother brother
[35:47] Beckett he's not a figure he said you
[35:50] know you must be Christians who who'll
[35:53] say God thank you for the child because
[35:56] it has made me a better person
[35:57] not Lord don't ever bring me that to me
[36:00] no thank you Lord bring more so that I
[36:02] can be better
[36:03] god bless you so quick another testimony
[36:22] is just there in Kiwanis and the no DA's
[36:25] fellowship last night
[36:27] and it just dawned on me again
[36:31] so a few a few Wednesday's ago I was I
[36:35] had a little mini Simonet and I was
[36:38] pointing out the distances that people
[36:40] can travel and all of a sudden is the
[36:43] same thought in the same spot on the
[36:45] other side of the of the world so well
[36:50] we we're about twelve thousand
[36:52] kilometers away from where we grew up me
[36:54] and brother Paul but me and brother Paul
[36:56] grew up about a hundred kilometers from
[37:00] each other and we are now on the other
[37:03] side of the world
[37:04] and I love him and man I love that guy
[37:07] Oh Luke Wallace is a special to us
[37:26] oh so now when we came out here we sort
[37:37] of took a step of faith and coming to
[37:39] Wellington and I really I always said if
[37:44] there's one place we'll never live in
[37:45] New Zealand that's Wellington coming
[37:49] here was quite hard and leaving the work
[37:52] that I was doing there and coming into
[37:54] the city it was quite hard and I didn't
[37:56] really know what to do so I thought I'll
[37:57] just take the first job that comes up on
[37:59] trade me and they hung them up and they
[38:01] said yeah come and start with us so I
[38:03] come up and I did my first two or three
[38:06] weeks and I hated it I absolutely hated
[38:08] it and I'm not very emotional and I
[38:11] think I only cried once and my dog died
[38:13] and I was to the point sitting in my
[38:17] decade that I was so worked up and
[38:19] frustrated that the tears were running
[38:21] down my face I was just so upset I just
[38:24] hated it so much and I was stressed
[38:28] because I knew the money that we were
[38:30] earning was not enough to support us and
[38:32] Wellington it was you know only just
[38:36] enough to buy and I was stressed about
[38:40] that knowing that we were living with
[38:41] Andy and another time and so they looked
[38:44] after us but when we go out on our own
[38:46] housing I so work that said I just need
[38:51] to listen and I hadn't been listening
[38:55] anything wrong so I just press play
[38:58] a reading from Joshua he not maybe not
[39:03] discouraged and see and wherever they'll
[39:07] go or so blessing we never come home
[39:10] Wellington looking for a blessing Jacob
[39:13] he never went for the blessing for the
[39:16] birthright
[39:17] we came to Wellington because we knew
[39:19] this was a good place to be we didn't
[39:20] I'm looking for the blessing that the
[39:22] Lord promised will bless you and it's
[39:25] just like a part and it's learning apart
[39:27] and it's received it's a part and God
[39:30] can pardon you but if you don't exceed
[39:32] the pardon it's not a pardon T and it's
[39:35] the same with us promise see dope Leslie
[39:37] if if I trust and
[39:39] trust in me and so after that I just
[39:44] said okay Lord I'll just trust you I'm
[39:46] here for a reason I'll just trust you
[39:48] and so I worked at that place for six
[39:51] months and he used me and ways to
[39:55] counsel basically was very very way with
[39:58] people which has been quite good and
[40:00] hopefully we can hold onto some of those
[40:02] friendships but then I seen a small head
[40:07] on the bottom of a trade me listing and
[40:08] I don't even know why I'm quiet about it
[40:10] but I just rang up and asked about it
[40:12] and I had a good feeling about it and I
[40:16] went and met the guy and talked about
[40:18] what they were doing and I said I yeah
[40:20] sounds good but it's a bit risky for me
[40:21] to come it's a new company and I said
[40:24] I'm not interested and so I left it at
[40:27] that and then two weeks later he rang me
[40:29] back up and he said I have you been
[40:31] thinking about the job and I sort of
[40:33] said I sort of had that the job was
[40:35] based on bikuni and I didn't want to
[40:37] move there and I didn't want to travel
[40:39] and stay away every week so I said I
[40:42] have I like the opportunity but unless
[40:44] you've got a full-time job in Wellington
[40:46] I'm not interested and he said I well
[40:49] and a couple weeks time there will be
[40:50] full-time work in Wellington so he said
[40:53] why don't you come in and meet the owner
[40:55] of the company as well so I went in and
[40:57] met them and they're both very
[40:58] professional type people and nice nice
[41:01] people and so it's a few random things
[41:05] started to happen so first off the guy
[41:07] said to me so why don't you come in and
[41:09] meet us and maybe it will be a match
[41:10] made in heaven and I thought that was
[41:12] quite funny coming from just a normal
[41:14] person and okay yeah fine
[41:18] so then I I rang someone up I might even
[41:23] be my dad or someone else I can't even
[41:25] remember who it was it was a mouth of
[41:27] somebody else and they said oh maybe
[41:28] it's a match made in here but I'm sure
[41:30] it was dead well someone random that
[41:32] would say such a thing
[41:33] so that was twice I was like okay what's
[41:36] going on here I've never even heard of
[41:38] this place
[41:38] our Coony so I ran Chris up to talk to
[41:41] Chris and asked and tell Chris about my
[41:44] job and and he answers the phone he's
[41:46] like ah hey bro I'm just some on the
[41:48] train going through our Coony it's like
[41:50] I've never even heard of this place
[41:51] before
[41:52] so I was okay there's something to this
[41:55] so I said oh that's the Lord's well when
[42:00] he wants me to be here I'm just going to
[42:02] lay out what I want I'm just going to
[42:03] ask for what I want and I just laid it
[42:06] out to them and they said yeah we'll
[42:07] give you the job and so I went back to
[42:10] my old employer and I handed in my
[42:12] notice and he got massively mad that I
[42:15] was leaving and told me to get off site
[42:16] immediately without my notice period so
[42:19] that was okay I went and told the new
[42:24] job that the boss had fired me for
[42:26] handing in my notice
[42:29] so he said okay that's fine we can start
[42:32] you but for the first week you'll have
[42:33] to govern spend a week in our County
[42:35] before the work in Wellington starts
[42:37] yeah just you know like you've got a lei
[42:41] there's so many promises in the Bible
[42:43] but if you don't receive that promise
[42:45] and actually have faith for the promise
[42:48] then you won't receive the promise so we
[42:50] just say thank you Lord are trusting for
[42:52] we're believing for a Nadine keeps
[42:54] saying to me as she was getting stressed
[42:56] with the money and we were taking money
[42:57] out of savings every week and she said
[42:59] you said the Lord was going to bless us
[43:01] here where's that where's the blessing
[43:02] and and just something inside of me was
[43:05] saying just wait we just have to wait we
[43:06] just have to trust don't worry about it
[43:08] like brother I was just saying don't
[43:10] worry about it because worries not going
[43:12] to do you any good he's made the promise
[43:13] just trust with the promise and the
[43:15] promise will come god bless you brother

[50:52] god bless you Saints is a wonderful to
[50:55] be in the house of the Lord and I just
[50:57] look at that song up there and it says
[50:58] that talking about your strife sand and
[51:01] problems and may the Lord take those
[51:03] things from us and I certainly believe
[51:06] that he's doing great things in our
[51:09] lives as we sit here this morning he's
[51:11] done it's been doing great things in our
[51:13] lives all the way through our life but
[51:15] the thing is brothers and sisters we
[51:17] need to be able to recognize those
[51:18] things that he's been doing in our lives
[51:21] before we even come to the Lord amen you
[51:27] know this is the first time I've
[51:29] actually been in this building since you
[51:30] went from the earthly to the heavenly
[51:35] but it's a nice place it's a nice place
[51:38] and I just asked to was asked yesterday
[51:42] to take a meeting this morning I thought
[51:44] well that's just amazing isn't it one
[51:46] day's notice but I have to be out of
[51:50] here at twelve o'clock to catch the
[51:52] ferry to the South Island so I'm just
[51:54] passing through very very quickly so if
[51:57] I if I cut things short and I'm gone at
[51:59] 12 o'clock it's not because I think
[52:01] you're going to stone me or something
[52:02] like that I just have to be out of here
[52:05] and you know the ship doesn't wait for
[52:08] us so let's just bow our head chewy Lord
[52:12] Jesus we are in your presence Lord we're
[52:16] at or more gathered in your name Lord
[52:18] you said that you'd be in the midst of
[52:19] us Lord and Lord we are a multitude of
[52:24] people Lord different backgrounds and
[52:26] different experiences in our lives Lord
[52:30] but you're the one that's gathering all
[52:32] those particular varieties of people
[52:36] together to make up a great body that
[52:38] you'll take in a body change Lord and
[52:41] Lord we're living under the influence of
[52:44] our theophanies because Lord God you
[52:49] brought a message to us to contact
[52:52] that's theophany that's beyond
[52:54] and that great eagle anointing was the
[52:57] only thing that could come in our midst
[52:59] and connect us and Lord this new birth
[53:03] of this hour is to connect our soul to
[53:06] our reality because these bodies Lord
[53:08] you said is not our reality and our
[53:12] prophet could come and he said you have
[53:14] never seen the real William Branham
[53:16] because he was on the inside of that
[53:18] house of a flesh body
[53:20] lord I pray come this morning Lord God
[53:23] and I just pray that you take over the
[53:25] meeting and we want to remember to your
[53:27] brother being right now wherever he is
[53:29] and PNG I think of his Lord that you
[53:32] would anoint him you use him Lord in a
[53:34] mighty way Lord I know the people well
[53:37] over their Lord are such gracious people
[53:39] law they're such rule or respectful
[53:42] people Lord and I pray Lord God that
[53:45] you'll just bring the preacher and the
[53:47] people together there Lord God for a
[53:49] great blessing to flow Lord so Lord that
[53:52] they could come to maturity law we ask
[53:55] this for your glory in the name of Jesus
[53:58] Christ amen
[54:00] oh god bless you thank you musicians I
[54:03] really appreciate these my goodness we
[54:05] young fellows here okay thank you this
[54:11] is our hearing this morning and when I
[54:16] come into a meeting like this this is
[54:18] actually just a very very I would say
[54:20] altered version of something I preached
[54:22] in our church a couple of years ago and
[54:24] so I don't want anybody thinking this is
[54:26] a loaded sermon it's not a loaded sermon
[54:28] but it is loaded but there's not a
[54:30] loaded sermon against somebody and what
[54:34] we need to do is understand or what the
[54:37] Lord has been doing in our lives all the
[54:39] way through what he's doing now and what
[54:42] has expectation is for us as we're on
[54:46] this journey so if we will turn to 1
[54:49] Corinthians this morning just a flick
[54:54] that up and my subject this morning is
[54:59] the husband meant is harmonizing his
[55:03] varieties
[55:05] amen he's harmonizing the different
[55:10] varieties that is in the body so by
[55:14] election God must bring you to an
[55:18] expected end is that right
[55:20] because of the genes seed that's in the
[55:22] soul God must bring that gene seed to
[55:26] know it's reality but the thing is were
[55:29] the gene C than the soul Satan has got
[55:32] all his demons targeted on you is that
[55:38] right and he's trying to get you to not
[55:42] be able to stand in your identification
[55:46] and stand with power and withstand those
[55:49] things he's trying to wear you down and
[55:52] what he does he uses the human mind in
[55:56] such a way to complicate you and let's
[55:59] just look this morning at the scriptures
[56:01] I'm going to read this up here and
[56:05] Apostle Paul he's the message of the
[56:08] first church age and we know that by
[56:10] Apostle Paul every star every minister
[56:14] is patterned off Apostle Paul's outright
[56:16] brother babe says I preach what Paul
[56:18] preached when he went beyond the curtain
[56:21] of time he could look right back to that
[56:23] church age where Apostle Paul who met
[56:25] the pillar of fire in that second Exodus
[56:28] he could say I preached what he preached
[56:30] because how could he do that because
[56:32] brother Branham it the same pillar of
[56:34] fire is that right and so here's Apostle
[56:37] Paul and he says do we begin again to
[56:40] commend ourselves or need we as some
[56:42] others epistles of commendation to you
[56:45] or letters of commendation from youth
[56:47] this is your only personal written in
[56:49] our hearts known and read of all men
[56:51] that's a letter for as much as you are
[56:54] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[56:57] Christ ministered by US written not with
[56:58] ink but with the spirit of god the
[57:00] spirit of the Living God not of tables
[57:02] of stone but in flesh the tables of the
[57:04] heart and such trust have we through
[57:07] Christ to God would not that we are
[57:12] sufficient of ourselves
[57:15] amen no matter what you do not there's
[57:21] no merits of yourself that will get you
[57:26] through anything it's God doing
[57:28] everything for you and it's that you
[57:29] having to let go and let God take care
[57:32] of every situation that you're in
[57:34] because there is a law of God and the
[57:37] law of God has let go and let God
[57:39] but many times you want to hang on to
[57:41] something
[57:44] hang on to our personalities hang on to
[57:47] our past hang on to our complexes but
[57:51] God must break those things I met not
[57:55] that we are sufficient of ourselves to
[57:58] think anything as of ourselves but our
[58:01] sufficiency is of God is bow heads
[58:06] Emily Lord I've just pray you should
[58:08] take these words this morning Lord Lord
[58:12] I cannot finish the sermon because it's
[58:15] such a large sermon but Lord just give
[58:16] me the highlights that I need to preach
[58:18] to this church Lord well we asked us for
[58:21] your glory in Jesus name Amen
[58:24] my goodness be it you may be seated it's
[58:26] but dry up here now
[58:36] the prophet of God says that God is a
[58:40] God of variety amen so that means he is
[58:46] not going to be a cookie cutter God that
[58:48] is going to stamp everybody out the same
[58:51] way and you must understand that God is
[58:54] not interested in what you want to be
[58:57] he's interested on what he wants you to
[58:59] see us because when God looks at you
[59:04] he's looking at you from eternity he is
[59:06] not looking at you from the the the
[59:09] realms of Laodicea where people are
[59:11] trying to make themselves in the image
[59:14] of something that not meant to be now
[59:17] I've been in the message 35 years so
[59:19] that's a lot longer than some of you
[59:21] have been are born and I have seen many
[59:24] people pressured to be the way others
[59:29] want them to be amen and the ones that
[59:34] pressure these people are actually
[59:37] working against the Lord then you meet
[59:42] people brethren who become inward
[59:44] thinking because of their history their
[59:47] will go in history and they dwell on the
[59:51] hurts and the pains from the past and
[59:54] God must break those hurts and pains
[59:57] from the past because that is hindering
[1:00:00] him from taking you further praise the
[1:00:03] Lord
[1:00:04] excuse me I haven't got a suit on this
[1:00:06] morning I had to get on the ferry so I
[1:00:07] had to hip to be a little bit secondhand
[1:00:13] and many people they just fail to be
[1:00:16] able to grasp what the Lord is trying to
[1:00:18] achieve in their lives now the thing is
[1:00:20] there are seasons for everything in the
[1:00:23] Bible there's times and seasons and at
[1:00:26] least yes he says a time for this the
[1:00:27] time to live a time to die attempt to
[1:00:29] plant the turn to harvest there are
[1:00:32] times and seasons for all things there's
[1:00:34] a time and a season when God does not
[1:00:37] use you there's a time in the season
[1:00:39] where he does use you think there's a
[1:00:41] time in the season when he's finished
[1:00:42] with you is that right and you must be
[1:00:47] able to identify the seasons of God in
[1:00:50] your life because if you don't
[1:00:52] understand the seasons for you you'll
[1:00:54] get complexes and just think I'm no good
[1:00:57] now this person's bigger than me office
[1:00:59] minister preach is better than me
[1:01:01] you cannot go by what you feel about
[1:01:03] yourself you must die by what the Word
[1:01:05] of God says remember there was the time
[1:01:09] in the season for Elijah he had a
[1:01:12] certain time with God used them did he
[1:01:14] go to complex because everybody he
[1:01:16] thought everybody had abandoned him and
[1:01:19] then God had to lift the seal off his
[1:01:21] life and show that there was 7000 that
[1:01:23] help not bail their heads to bow in the
[1:01:26] same way as our prophet in choosing up a
[1:01:28] bride thought he was the only one left
[1:01:31] and God lifted the seal of his life to
[1:01:34] show that there was us coming in the
[1:01:37] future so that when the Prophet was
[1:01:40] finished with we could step onto the sea
[1:01:43] now season so the Prophet had his season
[1:01:46] now you've got your season and then that
[1:01:50] season is when God is going to magnify
[1:01:53] who you really are
[1:01:55] praise the Lord John the Baptist had a
[1:01:59] season
[1:01:59] how long did God train them for 30 years
[1:02:02] or something like that for how long six
[1:02:05] months and here was John watching
[1:02:11] prophecy oh I tell you something
[1:02:14] brothers and sisters as there every time
[1:02:16] we must watch prophecy is right now you
[1:02:20] cannot come to church and say well I'm
[1:02:22] just going to pick my bags and wait for
[1:02:23] the buddy change you must be watching
[1:02:25] prophecy and John knew the Messiah must
[1:02:30] come and so he is watching his ministry
[1:02:34] had been going for such a certain amount
[1:02:36] of time and then when the prophecy of
[1:02:38] the Messiah was coming into plain view
[1:02:41] he knew his time had come to decrease
[1:02:45] because now the fullness of the word was
[1:02:48] going to increase John had a light for
[1:02:51] his day but now the focus of the Shalom
[1:02:53] the rising of the Sun was coming for his
[1:02:55] day so we must identify what God is
[1:03:00] trying to achieve in you now
[1:03:05] I'm just trying to get myself into a
[1:03:08] place where I can see what the Lord's
[1:03:10] opening up to me now when you come into
[1:03:13] this work you have six seals of your
[1:03:19] earthly our pilgrimage everyone goes
[1:03:24] quiet
[1:03:25] you have your six seals of your earthly
[1:03:29] pilgrimage but when the seventh seal was
[1:03:34] revealed he shows you your eternal
[1:03:37] pilgrimage is that right because the
[1:03:41] purpose of the seventh seal Christ
[1:03:43] coming was to lift the veil on you you
[1:03:48] were walking around for a long time
[1:03:50] veiled but God had to lift the seals on
[1:03:54] your life and reveal to you your reality
[1:03:59] praise the Lord because we came into
[1:04:02] this world six seals affecting us until
[1:04:06] we met the seventh one and then when the
[1:04:09] seventh one revealed himself to us
[1:04:11] personally I meant not dispensational II
[1:04:14] now personally he takes us what he shows
[1:04:18] where we come from and he shows where
[1:04:22] we're going to and then what does he do
[1:04:25] by new birth he wipes out the record of
[1:04:30] those six seals in their lives is that
[1:04:34] right because you are born with a book
[1:04:40] of life understanding of yourself you
[1:04:44] were born contaminated with a book of
[1:04:47] life of yourself because place the
[1:04:50] profligacy is from the time you're born
[1:04:52] at the time you die everything is
[1:04:54] recorded of you but God must marry a
[1:04:57] virgin is that right and a virgin has no
[1:05:05] history oh my goodness me I hope you
[1:05:09] understand this now I virgin has no
[1:05:12] history so it does not matter what your
[1:05:17] natural pass was like path past was like
[1:05:20] God must bring you back into a spiritual
[1:05:24] virgin position and that is the pair of
[1:05:29] the blood and this day brothers and
[1:05:30] sisters there has never been a day with
[1:05:32] the blood of Jesus Christ is so powerful
[1:05:35] that he could break the fooders of just
[1:05:38] vacation and said you're never did it in
[1:05:41] the first place
[1:05:43] praise Lord you'll never get anything he
[1:05:47] puts it right back and abstract right
[1:05:49] back to the devil II says it slaps it in
[1:05:51] his lap easy you never did it
[1:05:54] that's my confidence that no matter what
[1:05:57] my past did I never did it now I'm a
[1:06:02] virgin to Christ I have no history and
[1:06:05] you could not go out to rehab and tell
[1:06:08] her that you've got a history as a
[1:06:09] prostitute and live in the face of Selma
[1:06:12] because what was Selma the Seventh Seal
[1:06:15] marrying a woman that once had a past
[1:06:19] but it was wiped away and revealed her
[1:06:21] name in the Lamb's Book it's time to
[1:06:28] look higher than our earthliness amen
[1:06:32] because the devil is pounding people and
[1:06:35] pounding them and pounding them and I
[1:06:37] get pounded all the time too but I tell
[1:06:39] the bag we need to concentrate on what
[1:06:44] God is trying to do the prophet of God
[1:06:46] says it's like Michelangelo had this big
[1:06:49] slab of rock and you could look at that
[1:06:53] rock and say that's rock that is a in
[1:06:57] front of us here as a rock that's none
[1:06:59] too flesh amen it was a bit of
[1:07:03] earthliness that was none too flesh but
[1:07:05] inside that rock was a vision amen but
[1:07:11] all of that God had to do was to remove
[1:07:13] the parts that were not a part of the
[1:07:15] vision if it's what God was doing is he
[1:07:18] reason removing the book of life parts
[1:07:21] of us that is not a part of the vision
[1:07:24] and sometimes you get chopped here drop
[1:07:26] there chop there chop do as I say praise
[1:07:28] God because inside of that rock of
[1:07:31] humanity there is a vision coming into
[1:07:33] plain view a vision that will take you
[1:07:36] in a body change because we're living in
[1:07:39] ladders here a time where there's so
[1:07:41] many pressures so many influences
[1:07:44] everybody's going around with their
[1:07:46] little cell phones and trying to be like
[1:07:47] some Dame in Hollywood or something like
[1:07:49] that but the thing is
[1:07:51] God has given us a message and he says
[1:07:55] look on this and be changed and how are
[1:07:59] you changed in an instant no it goes
[1:08:02] from glory to glory to glory to glory
[1:08:05] unto your in his glory in the glorified
[1:08:07] body praise the Lord because this is a
[1:08:11] day where God is brought a messaging you
[1:08:13] could hear from your theophany amen and
[1:08:17] you have to be dead developed into the
[1:08:20] image and a dark room get that that's
[1:08:24] why Satan's Eden is here is that right
[1:08:27] say all weren't such a bad place
[1:08:29] Satan's Eden must be here on the earth
[1:08:32] because you cannot develop the negative
[1:08:35] into the positive unless you've got a
[1:08:36] dark room to shine the light through so
[1:08:41] it's time to for us to stop grizzling
[1:08:43] about Satan's either and say praise God
[1:08:45] and then when the picture is developed
[1:08:50] God gets rid of that guy praise the Lord
[1:08:55] are you with me now this is matching
[1:08:58] time the prophet of God said and things
[1:09:00] that there are to be this is a time
[1:09:02] where God is matching you to your
[1:09:05] reality this is the only thing he's
[1:09:07] taking in a rapture is his character in
[1:09:10] you amen
[1:09:11] now you think about how that God is such
[1:09:15] an amazing creator that he goes right
[1:09:18] back into your history hundreds and
[1:09:20] hundreds of years all the way back
[1:09:22] because an eternity you have a perfect
[1:09:25] image a perfect body his hair right and
[1:09:29] then that body you might have blue eyes
[1:09:31] or you might have green eyes you might
[1:09:32] have certain color of eyes and certain
[1:09:34] color of hair and things like that and
[1:09:36] God who knows the beginning from the end
[1:09:38] he's been plotting the course of all of
[1:09:41] your natural ancestry to match you with
[1:09:45] something in another dimension now think
[1:09:49] deepness think deep all the way back
[1:09:53] great kick back take Benoit in break
[1:09:56] break break break gain there they got
[1:09:57] the eyeballs for each other and they got
[1:09:58] married and had kids and they're so
[1:10:00] they're married this one and this one
[1:10:01] married yet when kids were coming out
[1:10:03] all the way for hundreds of years is
[1:10:04] there right
[1:10:05] hundreds of years and you think it's a
[1:10:06] role in an accident that you're here in
[1:10:08] 2019 and ain't Amen because he must mix
[1:10:14] this with this to get the right color
[1:10:15] here and this for this to get the right
[1:10:17] kind of here if this was this to get
[1:10:18] kills in the hair this was this get
[1:10:20] right colorized
[1:10:21] this what this and is that right so
[1:10:24] you're not an accident he's been mixing
[1:10:26] these all together so that you could be
[1:10:28] in the image of that which you'll go to
[1:10:30] an eternity the only thing is it won't
[1:10:34] be 61 years old like me and brother and
[1:10:36] Nene here it will be a young body
[1:10:39] praise the Lord so here we are and
[1:10:43] bodies that has an expectation and I'm
[1:10:46] preaching to this body your time is
[1:10:48] going to come to an end soon and this
[1:10:51] pissed house this rubbish tin is going
[1:10:52] to be disposed of and we're going into
[1:10:54] our reality form and that's not the end
[1:10:57] of the story because the theophany is
[1:10:59] not the end of the story the end of the
[1:11:00] story is a glorified body in the
[1:11:01] Millennium and a new heaven and the new
[1:11:04] earth after that is that right praise
[1:11:08] the Lord
[1:11:08] so you are a privileged people to have
[1:11:11] your names in the book and he said he
[1:11:14] said then the scripture says my sheep
[1:11:16] hear my voice is that right and it's not
[1:11:20] the voice of a man he says ain't a
[1:11:21] stranger you will not follow now where
[1:11:24] did you hear that voice in the beginning
[1:11:26] you heard his voice and eternity because
[1:11:30] when he was creating the heavens in the
[1:11:32] earth you were in him is that right you
[1:11:35] were in heaven you heard him speak to
[1:11:37] speak to speak less and speak this
[1:11:39] praise the Lord
[1:11:41] he said when Jesus went to Calvary you
[1:11:45] were in him quote don't get quiet on me
[1:11:49] now this is a quote when he went to
[1:11:52] Calvary you were in him when he paid the
[1:11:55] price he you were in him when he went
[1:11:58] down into hell
[1:11:59] you were in him when he rose from the
[1:12:01] dead you were in him is there right so
[1:12:04] how do you know you were in him well
[1:12:07] that same voice was a creative voice
[1:12:09] that was in Jesus Christ because before
[1:12:12] he was a flesh man for the form of
[1:12:14] redemption he was in theophany form I
[1:12:17] met it
[1:12:18] from Elohim to Melchizedek to go and buy
[1:12:21] and from the locals create all things
[1:12:23] but you were in Han you heard the voice
[1:12:27] now when you were in him at Calvary and
[1:12:30] afterwards you were there paying for
[1:12:34] your sins back there in him now how do I
[1:12:39] know that I'm elect nor do I know I'm
[1:12:46] elect because when God brings the word
[1:12:53] for your day and something in your heart
[1:12:57] says my this is real that is proof that
[1:13:03] you are in him back then because the
[1:13:07] blood speaks of things to come amen
[1:13:12] and we're living in the time of the
[1:13:14] voice of the blood which is speaking
[1:13:15] greater things than the time time of El
[1:13:17] of Abel the bread is speaking greater
[1:13:22] things now then when Jesus was here 2000
[1:13:27] years ago
[1:13:28] prays a lot but I say there's the same
[1:13:31] Jesus but he's just moved on and you
[1:13:36] must move on with the inspiration that
[1:13:39] the Lord is putting out in this hour and
[1:13:42] you must move away from how you see
[1:13:46] yourself and see yourself as how God
[1:13:49] sees you amen
[1:13:51] my where are we going with this praise
[1:13:55] the Lord I hope you're getting something
[1:13:56] so far
[1:13:57] because you've only got 50 minutes left
[1:14:00] now when we look at Saints in the Bible
[1:14:05] and the experiences that they went
[1:14:09] through it's easy to think that they
[1:14:12] were the end of the story and that
[1:14:15] there's no continuity of them we can
[1:14:19] accept what they went through to make
[1:14:21] them what they are a man I called this
[1:14:25] and the angel was there I want you to
[1:14:30] keep this thought the angel was there we
[1:14:36] can accept what Ruth went through say
[1:14:41] praise God for ease we can say look what
[1:14:45] Esther weighed 3 say praise God for
[1:14:47] Easter yeah we can see what brother
[1:14:51] Brandon went through is say praise God
[1:14:53] for brother Ben why just love reading
[1:14:54] about brother Brandon but do you like
[1:14:55] reading about yourself because I want to
[1:15:00] say praise God for a God is doing in my
[1:15:03] life
[1:15:03] praise God for what he's doing in your
[1:15:06] life because you are a continuity of
[1:15:09] what came when a prophet was here you
[1:15:12] must see yourself in a continuity
[1:15:14] because he said just near the end
[1:15:16] they'll come another surge of the Holy
[1:15:18] Ghost what to do to bring to your
[1:15:19] remembrance what was spoken back then
[1:15:22] and when you see what he was talking
[1:15:24] about coming into reality form now you
[1:15:27] anoint that word of the Prophet and you
[1:15:30] say Lord this is for me it's not for
[1:15:34] that person so much it is for me and I
[1:15:37] start anointing the word for the day
[1:15:39] that we're living in I'm not looking at
[1:15:42] somebody else I want to see what am i
[1:15:45] that anointing the word and bringing it
[1:15:47] to pass pays a load so when we look at
[1:15:56] something else somebody assets some
[1:15:57] these these are expressions in the Bible
[1:16:00] it can become impersonal to us and so
[1:16:03] too often we keep Jesus back in history
[1:16:08] come on there
[1:16:11] some people like to keep Jesus in
[1:16:13] history but Jesus is the god of the I am
[1:16:17] he is the I am in my life he is the I am
[1:16:23] he's not the I was in my life if he was
[1:16:26] the I was in your life you're still
[1:16:28] right now back in the denominational
[1:16:29] system you cannot have him as I was in
[1:16:32] your life he is the ever-present God and
[1:16:36] he's moving and he's moving and he's
[1:16:37] moving and you must come into a union
[1:16:41] with the I am part of the words praise
[1:16:45] the Lord
[1:16:46] so now we can often go we can go to the
[1:16:48] Bible we can quote our revelations ten
[1:16:50] one is a mighty angel coming down and we
[1:16:53] can see brother branham's part
[1:16:54] revelations 10 seven and his Melchizedek
[1:16:57] stepping into some Kentucky swamp but
[1:17:00] dust or whatever and he's speaking to us
[1:17:03] and he's bringing a word out to us and
[1:17:06] we can say praise God for revelations
[1:17:08] 10:1 revelations hits him and but what
[1:17:10] about revelations 10 8 to 11
[1:17:12] Amen the voice of the Archangel praise
[1:17:16] the Lord
[1:17:18] what is God doing to you in this hour
[1:17:23] now think deeply now about the
[1:17:27] visitation of an angel we like to look
[1:17:31] in the Bible says yes this prophet had a
[1:17:35] visit from an angel and we rejoice in
[1:17:39] the visitation of the angel now let me
[1:17:42] just give you a quote which I haven't
[1:17:44] got on the board here brother Branham
[1:17:46] says and my son's been preaching on it a
[1:17:49] bit I think he just stole it from me
[1:17:50] action
[1:17:52] she's got a fresh from the throne
[1:17:54] evening
[1:17:56] when Gabriel came to Zacharias when
[1:18:05] Gabriel came to that priest what did he
[1:18:11] do he came at a specific time
[1:18:15] angel was come at specific times and
[1:18:19] seasons now the prophet of God says when
[1:18:24] Gabriel he introduced the first coming
[1:18:27] and Gabriel were introduced the second
[1:18:32] coming so when does Gabriel suddenly
[1:18:36] turn up Gabriel always turns up mainly
[1:18:41] at the time of the evening sacrifice now
[1:18:46] remember this word evening sacrifice not
[1:18:49] the morning sacrifice of 2000 years ago
[1:18:53] but the evening sacrifice so Gabriel
[1:18:58] comes to Zacharias and Zacharias
[1:19:03] is a man who is offering up and since at
[1:19:07] a particular time so he's offering up
[1:19:11] instance in the time of the evening
[1:19:12] sacrifice and bam he stands a man in
[1:19:17] front of Zacharias and he tells him that
[1:19:21] his wife is going to bring forth a
[1:19:25] scriptural prophet of Malachi chapter 3
[1:19:31] and here is Zacharias listening to the
[1:19:37] angel a man six foot tall maybe olive
[1:19:43] colored skin and you know what I'm
[1:19:45] talking about saying when that meet the
[1:19:47] permit the prophet in Greensville
[1:19:50] techno cave and so the angel is speaking
[1:19:56] to Zacharias and Zacharias
[1:20:00] was a priest who should have known the
[1:20:03] Scriptures and he did know the
[1:20:06] scriptures but when the angels
[1:20:10] to him what was going to be scripturally
[1:20:13] for food through Zechariah's wife he
[1:20:19] didn't believe it
[1:20:21] now I want you to understand something
[1:20:23] why did the angel strike zecharias dum
[1:20:30] was because he did something wrong that
[1:20:33] day or well he did
[1:20:35] what did Sakurai's do wrong
[1:20:40] now remember Zacharias his wife
[1:20:43] Elizabeth I think what was an old woman
[1:20:45] there right so here's this old woman and
[1:20:51] this angel has come to tell them she's
[1:20:56] going to bring forth John now John is
[1:20:59] not a priest's name now write the name
[1:21:05] of a boy must come after the same name
[1:21:07] as a father but he gives him an
[1:21:14] unprecedent is this Zacharias and he
[1:21:20] should have said amen to Gabriel but he
[1:21:27] didn't because he didn't believe that
[1:21:30] God could go and bring life in an old
[1:21:34] woman like he did with Sarah and like he
[1:21:37] did with the Shunammite because he was a
[1:21:41] priest he knew the Scriptures amen he
[1:21:47] knew from genesis to malachi in the
[1:21:49] scriptures and he should have anointed
[1:21:52] the words of the angel
[1:21:56] oh my that's why there's so many dumb
[1:21:59] message believers because I know what is
[1:22:06] structurally there and they won't anoint
[1:22:09] the words of Gabriel in their own lives
[1:22:12] and they become dumb and it's a turn
[1:22:16] church week after week dumb and - there
[1:22:22] comes a time when God is going to use
[1:22:26] that same angel to anoint another woman
[1:22:30] to bring forth another life when when
[1:22:35] Elizabeth brought forth John it was only
[1:22:39] at that time that Gabriel could bring
[1:22:42] back his words to him
[1:22:44] but that same Gabriel when he went to
[1:22:50] Mary she had a wonderful attitude now
[1:22:57] with that angel Gabriel comes to you
[1:23:00] it's to give you an understanding of the
[1:23:04] scriptures that's pertaining to the
[1:23:07] person that angel is going to amen
[1:23:12] Gabriel is always giving a revelation to
[1:23:16] the person he goes to and then when he
[1:23:21] comes to that person they must anoint
[1:23:24] that word and bring it to life in their
[1:23:27] own lives that's why when he comes to
[1:23:31] Mary he finds a different kind of a
[1:23:34] person
[1:23:36] Elizabeth's problem wasn't here and
[1:23:38] Elizabeth they have had a problems just
[1:23:40] Sakurai's when he comes to Mary she says
[1:23:44] well this is an amazing thing the seals
[1:23:47] have just been lifted off my life amen
[1:23:51] he sir he's just a he said showing me my
[1:23:55] name in the book
[1:23:56] he's showing my name in our Isaiah
[1:23:59] chapter 7 verse 16 and she's she then
[1:24:03] she sees the angel up they take the
[1:24:07] scriptures and bringing those scriptures
[1:24:09] that
[1:24:10] around the earth for 800 years is that
[1:24:12] right prophecy went around the earth 800
[1:24:15] years from the time that I Sai spoke it
[1:24:17] and there was a time and a season where
[1:24:22] that prophecy going around had to
[1:24:25] connect with a woman and then the angel
[1:24:29] showed her what she's fulfilling and she
[1:24:32] said be unto me according to your word
[1:24:34] she anointed the words and she brought
[1:24:37] forth the first coming of Jesus Christ
[1:24:41] and the prophet of God see see there st.
[1:24:43] angel what it did to Mary is the same
[1:24:46] way it comes to the bride at the end
[1:24:48] time nothing about this
[1:24:52] here's Daniel from the book of Dana of
[1:24:55] course and then you're he's a he knows
[1:25:01] that there there's he's been looking at
[1:25:04] the books of Jeremiah he met and he said
[1:25:07] there's 70 years that they are going to
[1:25:09] be down under the control Babylon and he
[1:25:13] knows this this 2 years left and he
[1:25:16] needs to have an understanding at a
[1:25:18] certain time the time of the evening
[1:25:20] sacrifice
[1:25:21] here comes Gabriel always at a certain
[1:25:25] time and a certain season he comes
[1:25:29] Gabriel and Gabriel goes and unfolds the
[1:25:33] mystery and Daniels life to connect them
[1:25:37] with the heavenly and given the
[1:25:39] understanding of the political world
[1:25:41] that was going on all around them and
[1:25:44] brothers and sisters don't you be too
[1:25:46] worried about the political world out
[1:25:47] there God has got it all under control
[1:25:49] is that right in the Book of Daniel
[1:25:51] chapter 7 I think he says and the
[1:25:53] heavens roll all things God puts into
[1:25:57] power who he wants to put into power God
[1:25:59] takes out a power he wants to put into
[1:26:01] power it is not the vote of the people
[1:26:02] that they think they're putting this
[1:26:03] person into power so you can go and
[1:26:06] complain about this person or this
[1:26:08] person to that cows come home
[1:26:10] God put cement so we shut up and say
[1:26:12] thank you Jesus amen I am NOT going to
[1:26:16] fight the politics of this world because
[1:26:17] God uses politics to fulfill his word
[1:26:20] for the bride praise the Lord
[1:26:23] so I don't care about rush I do not care
[1:26:25] about America I don't care about all
[1:26:27] those things I care about what God says
[1:26:29] is going to be pertaining to me in this
[1:26:31] era because God is going to use politics
[1:26:34] to bring a boycott upon us to even to
[1:26:38] activate the faith we already have you
[1:26:43] have to have perfect faith now don't
[1:26:45] expect the squeeze to bring it on you
[1:26:47] have it now how do I have perfect faith
[1:26:50] by knowing the Scriptures that pertain
[1:26:52] to me in the Bible praise the Lord
[1:26:55] it's not just a faith to believe that
[1:26:56] you're healed or the faith to take away
[1:26:58] your headache it's a faith by knowing
[1:27:01] what is spoken of you that's why after
[1:27:04] the seals were preached by the bed of
[1:27:06] preaches perfect faith because it's not
[1:27:08] pulsations of faith it's a perfect faith
[1:27:11] and perfect faith what comes from that
[1:27:13] love comes out of all that perfect faith
[1:27:19] praise the Lord
[1:27:21] we need to anoint the word for hell day
[1:27:24] my brothers and sisters this is not a
[1:27:27] time I know I don't all over the world
[1:27:30] shake every church up like that but I
[1:27:33] shake myself up to know he was I Daniel
[1:27:38] so when Gabriel comes to Daniel it is to
[1:27:42] awaken him and guess what
[1:27:47] with Daniel sorry when Gabriel comes to
[1:27:50] Daniel and when Gabriel comes to Mary
[1:27:56] what does he call them beloved oh my
[1:28:02] goodness he calls you beloved let's turn
[1:28:10] to Revelation ship that ain't aunt five
[1:28:15] might as well just forget about my notes
[1:28:16] it's a waste of time mister the
[1:28:19] Revelation chapter 8 oh my goodness me
[1:28:22] brothers and sisters I hope that you
[1:28:24] catch these things I just love it when
[1:28:28] the Lord opens things up you know just
[1:28:30] supernaturally they're right brother nd
[1:28:32] here's my buddy
[1:28:35] is by preaching buddy this fella and
[1:28:41] when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[1:28:44] There was silence in heaven about the
[1:28:47] space of a half an hour now where was
[1:28:50] the location of that in Revelations 10
[1:28:55] revelations 10 was the reality of what
[1:28:59] was happening in Revelations 8 verse 1
[1:29:02] they're right because it's seventh seal
[1:29:04] but what should the watch now and I saw
[1:29:08] the seven angels which stood before God
[1:29:10] and to them were given seven trumpets
[1:29:11] and another angel came and stood at the
[1:29:16] altar having a golden censer watch these
[1:29:20] words now brethren and there was given
[1:29:23] unto him much and since at the time of
[1:29:30] the evening sacrifice incense was
[1:29:32] offered up unto God who was what was
[1:29:38] happening in Revelations 8 there was the
[1:29:41] evening sacrifice was now coming into
[1:29:44] operation and Gabriel comes in the time
[1:29:49] of the evening sacrifice to break the
[1:29:54] mysteries over your life and the Bible
[1:29:58] says in the evening time there shall be
[1:30:02] light so in the evening time we are
[1:30:07] living in the time of the evening
[1:30:09] sacrifice amen and Gabriel revelations
[1:30:15] 10:1 christ himself has come to show you
[1:30:19] how to anoint the word for this day by
[1:30:24] your prayers because instances prayers
[1:30:27] going back to the Lord to pray for
[1:30:30] things and season here must pray in
[1:30:34] season that's why Caesar the Lord's
[1:30:36] Prayer let it be done on earth as it is
[1:30:38] in heaven
[1:30:40] is that right so we must know what is
[1:30:43] heaven expecting of us now bring it down
[1:30:46] onto the earth if you understand now you
[1:30:51] must pray in season your past is not the
[1:30:56] season my goodness me can you get that
[1:31:00] brethren your past is not the issue your
[1:31:05] past has taken care of it's under the
[1:31:07] blood God don't see it no we must anoint
[1:31:11] the word for this error and Satan don't
[1:31:15] want you to do it oh look what you did
[1:31:18] oh look the complex that you've got here
[1:31:21] what God's will fitted back here is that
[1:31:24] right and we come and we carry these
[1:31:27] problems into a meeting and God is
[1:31:32] trying to do something with people but
[1:31:34] that bear down by their dark ages
[1:31:39] because because everybody's got seven
[1:31:41] Church ages in your life dark ages
[1:31:45] but God wipes away the dark ages is that
[1:31:49] right
[1:31:50] he puts it on there's blood and God does
[1:31:53] not looking at your dark ages he's not
[1:31:55] looking at your past he wants you to see
[1:31:57] who you are in this hour and start
[1:31:59] anointing the word and bringing it to
[1:32:01] pass and then a church comes into unity
[1:32:04] around identification praise the Lord my
[1:32:13] goodness me breath been preachers
[1:32:20] victory day now why would he preach
[1:32:22] Victory Day amen
[1:32:27] why would he preach Victory Day what did
[1:32:29] he preach victory day before the seven
[1:32:31] seals were preached amen he preached
[1:32:36] victory day after the seals were
[1:32:37] preached if he's the seven seals gardens
[1:32:39] and pressing in the preachers of the
[1:32:41] three day and you know wearing preached
[1:32:42] victory day at a place called Sierra
[1:32:44] Vista Sierra Vista they are how you
[1:32:49] could see the Mount
[1:32:51] I went looking at some mountains right
[1:32:55] now some mountains ions here amen and
[1:32:59] he's preaching victory day now why would
[1:33:01] he preach Victory Day well it's like
[1:33:04] this Redemption
[1:33:05] your souls Redemption was paid for at
[1:33:08] Calvary
[1:33:09] Amen but did you know that the Prophet
[1:33:13] said that you did not become a Christian
[1:33:16] when you gave your life to the Lord it
[1:33:19] goes quite when I say that he said you
[1:33:23] were always a Christian you were a
[1:33:28] Christian before the foundation of the
[1:33:29] world but when you gave your heart to
[1:33:31] the Lord you just recognized you are a
[1:33:33] Christian so what the Seventh Seal does
[1:33:37] he takes you back to eternity
[1:33:40] and guess what it don't matter what you
[1:33:45] do wrong by election you cannot be lost
[1:33:49] by election look you can do some any
[1:33:52] lick and do some things willfully wrong
[1:33:54] amen
[1:33:55] but he says you'll pay for every bit of
[1:33:57] it David was he left look what he did he
[1:33:59] knew he'd you know what he did
[1:34:00] eventually go into the details of what
[1:34:02] David did but David was elect God could
[1:34:05] not kill him because it was a man after
[1:34:07] God's own DNA amen
[1:34:12] you it was a man after God's own DNA he
[1:34:16] could look at his own DNA and his DNA
[1:34:18] was called his causing him somehow you
[1:34:20] know so about things around them that
[1:34:22] was not to flesh and when he did things
[1:34:25] wilfully wrong problems come into his
[1:34:27] family but it didn't take away his
[1:34:28] election you keep that in your mind
[1:34:32] brothers because the devil always tries
[1:34:35] to pick on your faults you say praise
[1:34:39] God I'm gonna serve God and then you
[1:34:41] trip over the cat and say some words
[1:34:43] that you shouldn't say just get back up
[1:34:45] again I meant you get back up again stop
[1:34:49] sulking
[1:34:50] get back up hey keep serving God and
[1:34:54] remind the devil that I haven't expected
[1:34:58] end and you haven't expected him praise
[1:35:02] the Lord you tell him his expected in
[1:35:04] he'll shut up right quick and take his
[1:35:06] flight give him six thousand volts
[1:35:07] Rangers hide Amen so brethren preachers
[1:35:12] victory day two thousand years ago he
[1:35:14] prayed the price for the salvation
[1:35:17] of your soul Redemption brothers and
[1:35:20] sisters does not mean that just anybody
[1:35:21] out there can be saved redemption means
[1:35:24] to bring back that what he already owned
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:28] you can't redeem something that you
[1:35:30] didn't once own you put on the Mirenda
[1:35:32] in the pawn shop you'll redeem it
[1:35:34] Beckett sayers was always yours
[1:35:35] we were just born than the devil's pawn
[1:35:38] shop before sorry
[1:35:41] so Redemption can be expressed I explain
[1:35:45] some things to people like this let's
[1:35:47] just say that you're heading down a a a
[1:35:49] river and there's a waterfall over there
[1:35:51] and you're going to go over the
[1:35:51] waterfall and be toast you're going to
[1:35:53] be finished and somebody steps out and
[1:35:56] pulls you out of there of going over
[1:35:59] there those are they can wrecks there
[1:36:00] what are you going to feel about them
[1:36:02] you go to love them you can appreciate
[1:36:05] them and that's what this whole walk is
[1:36:08] about love and appreciation for what God
[1:36:11] has done for you you never deserve one
[1:36:13] thing but election fulfills at all he
[1:36:17] said I chose you you did not choose me
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:22] he said he chose you has got nothing to
[1:36:24] do with your merits that's got nothing
[1:36:26] to do with how good you do and how nice
[1:36:28] if you dig you write and read your Bible
[1:36:29] that's not nothing to do with that I
[1:36:31] elected you I caused you I chose you
[1:36:34] it's all over but in the meantime he
[1:36:39] says I'm the Alpha and the Omega but in
[1:36:41] between the Alpha and the Omega he's
[1:36:43] doing some adjustments to your character
[1:36:47] praise the Lord he's doing some
[1:36:50] adjustments so for seven Church ages now
[1:36:54] watch this oh I love these deep things
[1:36:56] in the Bible you know if you understand
[1:36:59] in the Bible feasts you understand the
[1:37:03] seven feasts in the Bible the whole
[1:37:05] Bible opens up to you
[1:37:08] seven feasts in the Bible my half and
[1:37:10] the other half of my trips time flies
[1:37:13] when you're having fun there are seven
[1:37:16] feasts in the Bible Passover unleavened
[1:37:21] bread firstfruits their rights then the
[1:37:27] feast of Pentecost is the trumpets use
[1:37:31] of atonement Feast of Tabernacles in the
[1:37:34] Old Testament every one in Israel head
[1:37:38] to all the male's had to attend three
[1:37:41] feasts Passover Pentecost and
[1:37:44] Tabernacles now that shows us something
[1:37:48] with the feast of Passover there are two
[1:37:51] minor feasts that go with the feast of
[1:37:53] Passover unleavened bread and first
[1:37:55] fruits then there's a long time for the
[1:37:58] feast of Pentecost and at the end time
[1:38:02] comes the Feast of Tabernacles and the
[1:38:05] Feast of Tabernacles as a price of a
[1:38:09] change of dwelling place but with the
[1:38:12] Feast of Tabernacles comes the Feast of
[1:38:15] Trumpets and the feast of atonement now
[1:38:20] think about it now 2,000 years ago
[1:38:23] here's Jesus on Calvary thinking of you
[1:38:29] he's thinking of you and what drives him
[1:38:33] to go beyond his humanity he's thinking
[1:38:38] of you because he don't want to be alone
[1:38:42] he wants a part of himself to come into
[1:38:46] manifestation but Jesus went to the
[1:38:49] woman at the well he was not going to
[1:38:51] anything else but a part of himself is
[1:38:55] that right he only goes to a part of
[1:38:59] himself so when he goes and reveals
[1:39:02] himself to you at the end time he's
[1:39:04] coming to reveal himself to a part of
[1:39:05] him I just think however what we think
[1:39:10] he's coming to have to reveal himself to
[1:39:13] you
[1:39:13] he as he is going to reveal my goodness
[1:39:17] me the seventh seal is to reveal
[1:39:19] yourself to yourself
[1:39:22] amen he's revealing yourself to yourself
[1:39:27] because yourself has been blinded for
[1:39:30] such a long time but you must come back
[1:39:32] to yourself because you were born insane
[1:39:38] my goodness may is just flashing in
[1:39:41] front of me how do you bring a person
[1:39:43] back to sanity come on somebody tell me
[1:39:47] how do you bring someone back to sanity
[1:39:50] what you do is you have them look at
[1:39:52] familiar places is that right so what's
[1:39:57] your familiar place way back in eternity
[1:40:01] that's where I come from I got a look I
[1:40:04] got a look and I gotta look up keep
[1:40:05] looking at myself since where were you
[1:40:08] when I laid the foundations of the world
[1:40:10] joke when all the theophanies were
[1:40:13] shouting for joy looking for the day of
[1:40:16] the fullness of redemption praise the
[1:40:18] Lord's he's hid the body angel was
[1:40:21] trying to get Jobe to see you were one
[1:40:24] of those shielding for joy because in
[1:40:27] the time in the season those that were
[1:40:29] shouting for joy must connect with those
[1:40:31] on the earth now and come back into true
[1:40:35] worship are you with me now we come back
[1:40:40] into true worship so as long as I keep
[1:40:43] looking and looking and looking there's
[1:40:45] a dawning of a new day praise God I'm an
[1:40:50] eternal being and what God does as where
[1:40:55] as you're breaking into the dawning of a
[1:40:57] new day you look around you see all this
[1:40:58] all that deception that held me down the
[1:41:02] others horse-riders I thought that I was
[1:41:06] such a spiritual person but I was bound
[1:41:08] down by horse-riders where did the horse
[1:41:11] riders come in the horse riders came in
[1:41:13] and Genesis is there right if you must
[1:41:16] see in the book from Genesis to
[1:41:18] Revelation the whole seven seals their
[1:41:22] height good look this Eve Adams wife a
[1:41:26] part of Evan and she said she's walking
[1:41:30] around and an anointed one comes on this
[1:41:35] saying my god the president preach about
[1:41:37] anointed ones at the end time but it was
[1:41:39] an anointed one back then and what was
[1:41:41] their anointed one the white horse rider
[1:41:44] coming to annoyed her with words and
[1:41:47] lighter with images anoint her with
[1:41:52] anointing her
[1:41:54] amen amen the news media is anointing
[1:41:59] you with a white horse rider and to
[1:42:04] you're you're walking like one of these
[1:42:06] hollywood clearance instead of walking
[1:42:09] like a son or daughter of God
[1:42:11] but then the anointing changed it went
[1:42:16] from words to Cain killing Abel sick and
[1:42:20] seal their right first few seconds here
[1:42:24] and because Cain could not receive he
[1:42:29] did not accept the vision that God gave
[1:42:31] to Abel Abel yeah
[1:42:35] Abel he went away from the presence of
[1:42:39] the Lord and formed the denominational
[1:42:40] system in the Land of Nod an economic
[1:42:44] denominational religious system and we
[1:42:47] see it all out there third seal you
[1:42:52] comes down to Genesis chapter 6 you see
[1:42:56] the perversions of the earth haleh's
[1:42:58] come up on the earth programs his lair
[1:42:59] this here was replicated in Genesis
[1:43:01] chapter 6 fourth seal hell had come up
[1:43:07] into the human race
[1:43:10] subsea Enoch goes in I buddy change I
[1:43:14] met six seal the earth takes a tumble in
[1:43:19] the days of Noah seventh seal God comes
[1:43:24] down to Noah grace comes to know her
[1:43:30] here's a seven thunders and the book of
[1:43:32] Genesis and God was lifting the veil off
[1:43:37] of off of Noah to show him that you have
[1:43:43] another since oh my goodness
[1:43:48] you have another sense my friends a
[1:43:51] super sense and that super sense God is
[1:43:56] putting us through things to activate
[1:43:59] that sixth sense now a sixth sense is
[1:44:04] just believing what the angel said and
[1:44:09] then anointing it and then waiting
[1:44:16] that's why you said patience is a part
[1:44:19] of the stage of a perfect man
[1:44:23] long-suffering knowledge knowledge with
[1:44:27] the publisher of a perfect man and God
[1:44:30] must tune us in to what he's trying to
[1:44:35] to bring us to where was I thinking
[1:44:40] about him you must anoint that words and
[1:44:43] pray in season so what when the angel
[1:44:50] come to Noah it was to activate the
[1:44:54] sixth sense to refuse what the
[1:44:57] scientific civilization was telling him
[1:45:01] amen because you're anointed by a
[1:45:05] scientific civilization every day but
[1:45:08] their sixth sense does not look to the
[1:45:10] facts looks to the promise now when
[1:45:14] brother Brenner was preaching the sixth
[1:45:16] sense he shows some amazing things and I
[1:45:21] was having a rejoicing time the other
[1:45:22] day I thought my goodness in me so
[1:45:25] simple when you see it now you talking
[1:45:27] about people that get pray for there's
[1:45:28] talk about under the second Posse he
[1:45:31] said God he goes and prays for them does
[1:45:34] just go out and believe now one thing I
[1:45:38] always do when I'm overseas and I pray
[1:45:40] for a lot of people I saw when I went to
[1:45:46] Pakistan in 2017 I saw more supernatural
[1:45:49] in Pakistan there are ever seen in my
[1:45:53] life I can tell you something brothers
[1:45:58] and sisters
[1:45:59] the supernatural that was happening in
[1:46:01] Pakistan was as if you were in brother
[1:46:03] branham's meetings now I used to have a
[1:46:08] very negative attitude towards Pakistan
[1:46:13] but the Lord had to change my attitude
[1:46:16] because I was looking at the outwardness
[1:46:19] of people not knowing what was going on
[1:46:22] the inside of the people this way you do
[1:46:25] not look at somebody from the outside
[1:46:27] look at what's going on the inside and
[1:46:30] these people they had a faith that I had
[1:46:35] not seen and many people in a long time
[1:46:38] now a person would come and they asked
[1:46:42] for prayer
[1:46:43] now watch you must do it the way God
[1:46:45] does it they would come up and say
[1:46:48] brother I can't walk will you pray for
[1:46:52] me now I can't heal anybody I'm not a
[1:46:55] healer but God uses a channel it's okay
[1:47:00] okay so there was there was a sister now
[1:47:02] she's shuffling along like this she
[1:47:03] can't walk she says will you pray for me
[1:47:07] I said okay sister
[1:47:08] I meant will pray for your Lord Jesus me
[1:47:10] listen listen listen listen I pray for
[1:47:11] her it says now sister what you do now
[1:47:15] is you're now going to speak the word
[1:47:18] amen start speaking the word now God God
[1:47:26] is the high priest of your confession
[1:47:32] now you must keep that in your mind he's
[1:47:34] the high priest of your confession now
[1:47:36] you do not confess by going it's not
[1:47:40] confession the Bible also says
[1:47:42] profession but professing is something
[1:47:44] has to come out of your mouth so here's
[1:47:47] the high priest of your confession
[1:47:49] speaking it now this power in words Amen
[1:47:55] if you keep saying my car's going to
[1:47:57] break down my cars going to break that's
[1:47:59] going to break down because your
[1:48:00] speaking is going to break down if
[1:48:02] grandma's going to go fall over she's
[1:48:03] gonna fall over next year and thinks and
[1:48:05] then she deserves it was something like
[1:48:06] that she's going to do it you speak
[1:48:09] positive words about what has already
[1:48:12] been spoke
[1:48:13] and the Scriptures so it's just okay
[1:48:15] just go out now create an atmosphere I
[1:48:18] tell you something saying so she walks
[1:48:20] out his I'm healed Jesus has healed me
[1:48:24] she's walking shuffling along and like
[1:48:26] that like this like this first date
[1:48:28] nothing happens but she's not a
[1:48:33] faithless woman second day she's
[1:48:36] shutting down the street Jesus is
[1:48:38] healing and atmosphere comes rena
[1:48:40] and she has a visitation from an agent
[1:48:42] go straight through a poor flight then
[1:48:43] she walks there is El God and he says
[1:48:50] that is perfect faith that is that super
[1:48:57] sense to look at something that looks
[1:49:00] impossible and speak by the word that
[1:49:03] it's going to come to pass and P&G
[1:49:09] robbing many many times a pastor brings
[1:49:13] in his daughter 16 years old paralyzed I
[1:49:17] love these things she's paralyzed just
[1:49:21] be carried in by a daddy 16 year old
[1:49:23] Parag leaned up against the wall for
[1:49:25] five days while US brothers were
[1:49:28] preaching man she's been sitting here
[1:49:31] five days didn't even think about
[1:49:34] praying for her on the first day five
[1:49:36] days she's still sitting there
[1:49:38] on the fifth day is that right we're
[1:49:41] going to pray for this the sister so
[1:49:44] they lift her up and she showed me
[1:49:47] weighs about 40 kilos maybe not even net
[1:49:49] put it in the cheer she's hanging there
[1:49:51] that you're paralyzed as its sister do
[1:49:54] you believe in the power of the Roar she
[1:49:56] yes she's now the Lord can do one of two
[1:50:01] things I'm gonna give you a miracle or
[1:50:02] heal you over a period of time so we
[1:50:05] prayed for her it wasn't a miracle this
[1:50:08] is now go out and speak Jesus has healed
[1:50:12] me know do you really believe that says
[1:50:14] that she's yes and she really believed
[1:50:16] it so she started speaking one day
[1:50:21] speaking it
[1:50:22] nothing happens another day another week
[1:50:27] she's speaking it a month later and
[1:50:30] she's speaking Jesus has healed me the
[1:50:32] atmosphere is perfect and she's speaking
[1:50:36] it suddenly gets a feeling and a foot
[1:50:38] she keeps speaking and it goes up a
[1:50:40] meeting keep speaking it comes out he
[1:50:42] keeps speaking it comes up keep speaking
[1:50:44] that comes up and then she's walked
[1:50:46] perfectly back to school
[1:50:47] faith is the God of elm cognition you
[1:50:53] believe it so the same thing that is
[1:50:56] done for healing and that the first and
[1:50:58] second pulse must be the same end of the
[1:50:59] third pole because the first and second
[1:51:01] pulse is the earnest of a body change oh
[1:51:07] my goodness I tell you something my life
[1:51:16] got really changed in that nation my
[1:51:19] life got changed I'll tell you what
[1:51:23] softens my heart because I'm not known
[1:51:26] to be particularly I'm not a ballet
[1:51:30] dancer you know
[1:51:34] but what softened my heart so much was
[1:51:41] we in hundreds of woman came into the
[1:51:44] prayer line that could not have babies
[1:51:46] because they had put poison substances
[1:51:49] into the food and their whole
[1:51:52] reproductive organs shut down it was
[1:51:56] awful to look at just hundreds of barren
[1:52:02] woman and they coming up and look I
[1:52:07] can't heal any of them but they come up
[1:52:10] and it just breaks my heart I tell you
[1:52:12] something there's something about you
[1:52:14] know there's something about a righteous
[1:52:15] woman I don't know just hard to express
[1:52:18] what it is there's something about a
[1:52:20] righteous woman she wants to bring forth
[1:52:22] of life so I've got made a forward bring
[1:52:24] forth life and when you look in and when
[1:52:28] you look through spiritual eyes at them
[1:52:30] it just breaks your heart and I'm just
[1:52:34] in that coming up for prayer and I just
[1:52:36] about
[1:52:36] can't-can't I'm not an emotional person
[1:52:38] I tell you you need a search party to
[1:52:41] find my emotions but I tell you
[1:52:43] something that was causing some serious
[1:52:45] emotions inside of me when I was seeing
[1:52:48] these woman just wanting to bring forth
[1:52:51] life so they come into the prayer line I
[1:52:55] think I've talked to you this brother
[1:52:57] Anini they come into the prayer line and
[1:53:00] they've and they're looking at in their
[1:53:03] pleading from the Lord pleading and in
[1:53:07] one pass in the eminent look these parts
[1:53:09] of Pakistan they're seriously dangerous
[1:53:11] it is a seriously dangerous place in
[1:53:13] some areas because of the thing
[1:53:14] terrorists and things like that I've got
[1:53:16] to be guard with guys with machine guns
[1:53:17] and there's a whole street of them
[1:53:22] sitting on the street hundreds of them
[1:53:25] and they come up for prayer and because
[1:53:29] of that faith their expectation God was
[1:53:37] able to do something for them that was
[1:53:39] so profound they would come up and be
[1:53:43] prayed for in a Cell and you know virtue
[1:53:45] is strength it goes out from you you
[1:53:48] know what I'm talking about when there
[1:53:50] when the woman touched they touch the
[1:53:52] the the garment off of the Lord he felt
[1:53:54] something virtue in out from him and
[1:53:57] virtue is something that you all have
[1:53:59] but it needs to be tapped into
[1:54:03] because virtues that's something that's
[1:54:06] human virtue is something that's coming
[1:54:09] from the inside on the inside going out
[1:54:11] for that person and when and there's
[1:54:14] there's this is virtue going out for
[1:54:15] these people on my goodness me would
[1:54:20] pray for them and pray this and don't
[1:54:22] how many we prayed for just just
[1:54:24] hundreds of them I thought when I went
[1:54:27] back home I thought I better check up
[1:54:29] with these pastors what's going on say
[1:54:31] what this one's never going to have a
[1:54:32] child or something they're going to have
[1:54:33] a child this was no Kevin this was going
[1:54:35] to have a child this was gonna have a
[1:54:36] child this one's gonna have a child
[1:54:38] that's how God no you put that back and
[1:54:42] brother Brigham state uses all praise
[1:54:44] God for what brother Branham did but
[1:54:46] that's your portion
[1:54:48] and we're too often looking back at a
[1:54:51] God of history but it's a God of the I
[1:54:53] am and they must see Jesus Christ on
[1:54:56] this earth right now inside of you
[1:54:58] because that's the only Jesus Christ I
[1:55:01] go to see is the one and bright form and
[1:55:04] we must stop anointing this word oh my
[1:55:10] goodness me
[1:55:13] I've just got a few minutes that all

[1:57:40] voices are going away the voices are
[1:57:43] going away there next night this is so
[1:57:48] profound finish on this when we were
[1:57:52] praying for all these hundreds of people
[1:57:56] up in front of me stands this man and
[1:58:03] his wife and his kids and perfect order
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:12] is our God
[1:58:16] that is your God
[1:58:19] that is your creator or studio suspect
[1:58:21] some her definitely out you see vendors
[1:58:25] out Creator that is the dawn of the I am
[1:58:29] but do you believe it
[1:58:31] you must anoint the word if the Bible
[1:58:38] says I am revelations 10 eight to eleven
[1:58:40] I'm not going to walk around and I'm
[1:58:41] just revelations 10 8 to 11 place of God
[1:58:43] you know I'm the John who's prophesying
[1:58:45] again this if John was prophesying again
[1:58:48] what was he doing he's seeing the
[1:58:50] prophesy that the prophecy that has
[1:58:53] already been amen and he brings it up to
[1:58:56] the present tense by anointing it but by
[1:58:59] his own words he's putting power onto
[1:59:02] those words and bringing it to life and
[1:59:04] making it real around them right then
[1:59:06] and you know what
[1:59:09] no devil in Hell has succeeded in
[1:59:13] killing me in 35 years
[1:59:15] no devil in hell have tried believe me
[1:59:19] they've tried but the angel of the lord
[1:59:22] encamps of the believer and the angel of
[1:59:26] the lord is always revealing to you your
[1:59:29] position in the scriptures and when
[1:59:32] Jesus was on Calvary he knew what was
[1:59:35] coming next a met because he was looking
[1:59:39] back in Psalms because he was the word
[1:59:41] and those were those of those ones who
[1:59:43] wrote these Psalms there was David there
[1:59:45] was a CF and these ones they were under
[1:59:47] an inspiration that came from the one
[1:59:49] that's on Calvary so he's looking back
[1:59:51] to the ones he inspired to sing those
[1:59:54] Psalms to put it in the Bible and he's
[1:59:56] looking back it says now they're going
[1:59:57] to do this to me now and he's he's an
[1:59:59] expectation watching it what the kind of
[2:00:03] day they're going to do this now and
[2:00:04] this is this now I'm going to make this
[2:00:06] happen I thirst and they bring the
[2:00:11] vinegar to happen how did he make them
[2:00:14] do it
[2:00:14] he spoke why he knew what was going to
[2:00:18] happen and they did it do you believe it
[2:00:23] this is an error we're not just message
[2:00:27] believers we are living this message
[2:00:32] amen the message is coming to life and
[2:00:38] the ship is waiting for me at the port
[2:00:43] extend our faiths musicians would like
[2:00:50] to come for peace this bow here chewy
[2:00:58] Lord Jesus you are the author and the
[2:01:00] finisher of our faith what you started
[2:01:04] Lord you said that you'd finish Lord we
[2:01:06] don't have to fret Lord because we set
[2:01:08] your complete heads Lourdes bi-election
[2:01:11] Lord you nothing can stop us no divison
[2:01:14] hell no 200 million horse but nothing
[2:01:16] could stop your word from coming to pass
[2:01:18] they could not stop the prophet of this
[2:01:21] hour they had gunsights on him they
[2:01:23] could not stop the prophet of the hour
[2:01:25] and no matter what devils were trying to
[2:01:28] hinder him and standing in the gap and
[2:01:30] affecting his mind that did not stop
[2:01:31] anything because he came to his expected
[2:01:34] ends and he preached his last sermon he
[2:01:37] preached communion he preached I'm no
[2:01:39] longer the son of Charles and Ella
[2:01:41] Bremen but he came knew who he was
[2:01:44] an eternity Lord he knew he came from
[2:01:48] you and he's going back to you and his
[2:01:49] earthly pilgrimage was Charles and Ella
[2:01:52] Brennan but that was his book of life
