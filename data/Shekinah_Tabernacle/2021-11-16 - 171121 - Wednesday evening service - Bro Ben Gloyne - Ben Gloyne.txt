started off quickly with a a small prayer group in otaki in the beginning and that was starting off with the young brothers and [Music] polandias and brother impor and brothers here and that dovetailed and moved on to when the lockdown came that locked us out but then we start up the barbecues and that's been going for about three or four months now and starting to snowball it's starting to get the community it's starting to get a lot of people interested a lot of people actually saying god bless you every time they get a sausage so you're starting to know who's who and the locals and there's a lot of locals there a lot of maori locals that have been bruised from church anarchy and all this uh you know what it's like and um they're actually searching they're actually seeking so in

around to weeping with him the moon and stars could not go any farther they could not shine no more the very god that created them was dying on the cross and he bowed his head [Music] [Music] my kids

you're walking with us even now lord through life's journey i just pray dear god as we turn to your word now and we go into the communion of foot washing lord this evening i pray it'd be very real to each every one of us lord my hearts be tender lord may we not be calloused or harder and different when we approach lord your table tonight we're so glad we can be here i just pray you bless each one and for those who couldn't be here tonight be their portion too father we just want to commit the service into your hands love you so much dear god in jesus christ's name amen amen thank you brother ed thank you musicians amen good evening everyone god bless you amen it's good to have omar here welcome home god bless you amen trust you had a good time down down south amen praise the lord amen praise the lord we're going to read one scripture in uh second corinthians 5 and verse 21 and what a song praise god you know jesus was when he was in his glorified form he had still had the scars or the holes in his hands and his feet though it didn't bother him none and i just wonder i might be wrong i might be right i don't know we'll find out though one day when we're over there and time is no more and we we're fellowshipping somewhere for a million gazillion years and then we go up to the great city where we live and we go see our king maybe he'll just raise your hand and wave or see a nail print hallelujah amen i trust tonight that i say if that song didn't move you you should talk to the lord about it it should move you second corinthians 5 and 21. for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him may lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats tonight i'm not going to be very long but we have if you think about the great exchange i remember brother moses where are brothers brother moses china when we were there at the family camp there in taranaki and he was preaching and he and he preached a service on gethsemane and and he was dramatizing and taking things where brother branham was dramatizing it and and he said that while jesus was there in gethsemane everyone was waiting for an answer heaven was waiting for an answer the angels were waiting now because they're waiting because all of creation hinged on one man no one else would come and pay the price no one else could do the job one man could do the job there was not a this was this is not a trial run in the real this was the for real life this was the one moment and all of heaven he was there agonizing under prayer the bible says that his bloods fell like sweat down his face because of the agony because he knew what he had to go through he wasn't walking blindly when he was there and the next few moments of his last of his mortal life he knew the anguish he knew the suffering he had stood there on mount transfiguration and moses and elijah had preached to him about what he had to accomplish in jerusalem he knew full well what he had to go through you know i trust you knew one day what it was like to have a burden of sin who remembered that day the grievous burden of sin that was upon your life but i'm trust you know the joy of when you lay that all down at his feet that you don't carry that burden anymore but if you take that and then you times it by i don't know how many billion souls that have been upon the face of the earth he was carrying all of that because he was our sin offering he was our passover lamb the wrath of god was god's law was satisfied that day on calvary there had to be a penalty paid a price paid no one else could pay the price he was mother more than any other man he was wounded for our transgressions the chastisement of peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed he was bruised for our inequities hallelujah he there he was and he was agonizing in prayer and heaven was waiting for an answer will he or will he not he had a choice the lord jesus was no robot just like we're not a robot we've got to make a choice and you can either make a choice now i'm so glad we can make a choice now i'm so glad we can say yes to eternal life i mean that we can you know we still have life in these bodies i believe we're insane mind and we can accept eternal life tonight so heaven was waiting for the answer and then finally he i don't know how he would have voiced it but i doubt it was would have been a very agonizing way father if you be willing take this cup from me but then the next part but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done a yes went through up into heaven hallelujah now waiting for an answer and he said yes hallelujah and he went his hour he was done before his accusers the lamb for the slaughter and the wrath of god was put out upon him that day on calvary for you and i he became sin that we who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him we're here tonight to remember the lord's death burial and resurrection the past last moments of his life were not an easy moment but they were the most joyous because he had a joy set before him that was you and i redeemed i trust heaven's real to you i trust brother brown would sing let us look beyond the curtain of time he says lord let them look as he's singing that he says lord let them look beyond the curtain of time and i trust you've had a glimpse either by even just as a spirit coming upon your life or he opens his word to you more than a human can but god takes his word and anchors it in your soul and you can't get rid of it not that you'd want to the devil can't get rid of it it's a revelation it's deposited that you don't belong on this terra firma you don't belong in this culture you don't belong in this world i mean you belong in a different world i heard a preacher say i can't remember who it was but you know this this world is the closest that the believer will ever get to hell because hell is upon the earth this is the closest we will ever get because we don't have to go to hell because jesus as a sinner took our place he stepped out of the portals of glory said i'm going to redeem adam's fallen race hallelujah and by his great love he chose you before the foundation of the world he ain't going to lose one there won't be one seat at the marriage supper table that will be empty and we'll have to ask the question what happened to that brother or that sister no there won't be that they will all be there you say well it's all rigged it's rigged but god has given you a choice i'd rather cast my vote brother braham said that the devil voted against me god voted for me but depends where you cast your vote i would i would vote with god if god voted for me i'm going to vote for her i'm going to vote in that in that direction but here you know this is the closest that believe will ever get to hell but for some people out of their own choice this is the closest they'll ever get to heaven i don't want to be that kind of person that's why i see before i'm so glad we have choice we can make up our mind we can sell out to god we can say lord take my life make it thine not my will but thy will be done irrespective of what we've done our pastors are relevant to god he doesn't care where you came from he looked beyond the works of your natural flesh he saw a gene seed of predestination that's why he called you and that's why he gathered you to himself hallelujah adam because of the transgression the apostle paul would say that through adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive so because of adam we know through love he tried to redeem eve but couldn't do it and they fell man fell but because of what happened there in the garden we are now under a curse of sin until it's not a forever for the believer it's in until until jesus comes to you i'm not talking about uh coming the coming of the lord but i'm talking about when he came to you the prophet said about the woman at the well he said that when she spoke to the lord and he said i'm messiah he said the light of the word struck her soul and brought it to life and the reason that it happened is because she had representation in heaven she had a theophany in heaven that's why when the word came up across her path not religion she was full of religion she said our fathers worship here and jacob dug this well and she could tell explain all those kind of things but here was the one who had the water that you drink and thirst no more you know a lot of people are thirsty and they try and and they try and bury that thirst and drugs or women or men or computers or movies or whatever they try and people are just thirsty but they just come to the fountain of eternal life and drink of this water amen you won't thirst no more your life will be changed and i'm so glad i'm so glad the fountain's here he's here for you he's not just here he's here for you all of you you all of you all of us he's here for us amen so under adam we all die even so in christ shall all be made alive that's first corinthians 15 and and 22. so by the transgression of adam we are we are under the curse of sin until jesus came the woman of the well was under the curse of sin until she met messiah by a well amen as i said because she had pre she had representation in heaven when she heard that word her her soul came alive that seed that was dormant under all this concrete of man's ideas and broken marriages and broken relationships and they just all burst they just all turned to powder and floated away because the sunlight passed through it and brought it to life hallelujah and that's what's got so because of that josh you're still in a natural body but she wasn't under the curse of adam anymore the lord had redeemed her it's the same thing with you and i he came to ignite your life to live in your life to shake this world to make your living bible i mean to make you in his image hallelujah to mold you and shape you into his word amen that you can you think about you you think about the mighty men of valor there in the old testament killing hundreds of philistines and different ones and you know that's nothing compared to the real warriors of god that i'm looking at here in this building doesn't matter how young you are i mean there's demon spirits they fought a natural enemy we fight a real spiritual enemy and we need to be able to discern between his anointing and the anointing of god his anointing will always put question marks on the word we'll put question marks on who you are we'll put question marks on your salvation we'll put question marks on is this real is it not and you'll fill your mind with everything else but the lord you've got to be able to discern amen amen but the lord will just draw you to himself there'll be a pull amen after you've been in this you know you know it's like that sweet feeling comes over you and you feel so small and humble brother baby says there's angels coming round hallelujah that's the lord drawing close and all of us i trust if you've i trust you've had those kind of experiences in your life you don't want to step out of that you know what that is brother ram says it's you're actually your theophany bumping into you it's eternity bumping into you and it bumps into you and it bumps into you and eventually it's not just going to bump it's going to grab and carry you away because you and it are going to become one hallelujah this is not a fantasy story this is not something off netflix or tick tock or place your social media nonsense here this is reality you know people want to live in a fantasy world in this day there's all kind of escapism all kinds of things people watch and do and they you know cosplay they dress up as their superheroes and whatever more and you know that's just a that's just a a perversion of what god wants to make us we're more than superheroes we're more than people with powers and a troubled past that's not what this is about no god doesn't just keep our troubled past there and you know try no he takes care of it his blood washes that away and he fills us with his own spirit that whenever the enemy comes against you you can deal with them you can cast them out you can have victory you can live an overcoming life so we will once once upon a time under the curse that because of adam but now if you're a believer you're under the blessings of jesus christ whatever god is blessed is blessed sure we may we may backslide we may step out of line god will deal with us he'll bring us back but as long as we're his son or daughter that's the main thing as long as we're his child he's going to get us back on the road hallelujah so we're now under the blessings of being in christ brother brahm says this here in the position of a believer in christ i won't be too much longer and jesus not ignorant of what he was doing came down and he took his place with the sinner the church that he might redeem the church back to himself see i said it was a type adam was uh christ is the second adam where through the first adam all die through the second adam all live so and he says is in christ the mystery god revealed notice then one like the first adam and eve before sin separated them in death now christ the second adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original eden restoring back his bride and fellowship back with god as husband and wife in the garden of eden christ and his bride so we he's redeemed us from death you think you know people make it doesn't well people make all things out of communion but really it's a symbol it's actually making a public declaration because there's three ordinances we are told to do communion foot washing water baptism in the name of lord jesus christ right that's the three things that's the three ordinances you're making a public declaration that you and your sacrifice have become one and that you are under the blessings of jesus christ now you've been united to him you're not under the curse of adam and his unbelief in sin hallelujah amen we are a different kind of people he has made you a different kind of a person this is not just religion this is not just a church forget that idea there's not just a movement no this is a part of god's plan of redemption we are part of god's redemption plan you are we are not spectators the woman at the well was not a spectator she was a spectator in a lot of things in life maybe what was going on in the sanhedrin and the temple and different things in her village but in god's mind she was not a spectator in his plan she was the main event she was the apple of his eye she was the one he was looking for and it's the same thing with you and i this great end time that's unfolding in front of us that we're living in where the world is falling apart and brother graham had a vision of of of billy paul when he when he went out and smoking told lies to his father and you know wouldn't you know he he saw him falling and falling jumped out a window falling and laughing and falling and laughing and falling and laughing and the prophet was so caught up in it because he saw this was billy paul's spiritual state he was caught up in the things of the world thinking he was having a great time i thought i was having a great time but then the prophet cried out oh god don't let my son die in this state and then he saw two hands or a hand grab catch him and bring him back up to where he was originally hallelujah i remember i was like to fall and laugh and fall and laugh but i remember what it was like when those big hands of the lord they never dropped one they never dropped one i remember i was like to be caught by them those great hands and he put me on his shoulder carried me into a sheepfold hollywood i'm safe for eternity hallelujah and this world is falling and laughing and falling and laughing thinking it's having a great time it's heading for judgment we don't have to live that kind of life the lord doesn't want you to live that kind of life he wants to catch you but you've got to let them catch you you've got to open your heart for salvation open your heart for deliverance open your heart for healing for redemption whatever it is you open your heart say lord catch me hallelujah so this world is falling apart and that's not a shock to anyone but he has made us in such a way that we won't fall apart with this world i say thanks be to god you think that woman at the well her past was irrelevant to him our past doesn't matter rahabs your god takes care of us in such an amazing way rahab had a past and you know it could have been and and i'm just going to stop with this thought everyone every other israelite woman who is of a eligible marriageable h would have wanted to marry salmon he was of the tribe of judah he was a general in the army this guy was a catch he wasn't just any guy he was the guy he was the whole package but yet god in his great plan didn't didn't allow his heart to rest or his affection to rest upon anyone of israel but one and she wasn't even part of israel she was rahab the harlot hallelujah and i don't know if they did it in those days but you know it used to be a tradition and you know and and weddings in the west that the minister would say if anyone has any reason why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony let them speak now forever hold their peace and just to dramatize it maybe you know there came that point in the ceremony this is all drama but yeah i hope it just makes something a bit alive too you know but you know and then maybe one of those is like woman just couldn't stand it because she should have been standing there at the altar and so she stood up and said excuse me she's a harlot she's rehabbed the harlot and salman could have said hold on hold on if that is the case find one of the men that you did the act with and you could have heard a pin drop in the place because god before before they came together god had annihilated her past it was all dead hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and i that's why we shouldn't be haunted by our past god took care of it when he went to calvary he was taking care of your past and your memories and whatever regret he took care of our regret he took care of our shame he took care of our sin that day on calvary hallelujah and the children of israel without knowing it they took care of rahab's past that no one could stand up and say no she's not worthy married to this man hallelujah because god takes care of it and it's the same thing with you and i god's taking care of it he's taking care of our past he don't remember it no more hallelujah and in his great mind it doesn't even exist abraham would be told by god to take isaac his son his only son and go and go offer him on the mountain now abraham in the flesh you'd say no god you're wrong he has another son and that was ishmael but ishmael was not abraham's son ishmael was abram's son but yet if you looked it in the natural this guy who's standing here is abram no he's abraham and when god looked down when god looked down at abraham everything that abram did in the flesh was not attributed to abraham because abram died same man same body but yet he became a new creature because we know to change abram to abraham you got to put the h in which is the breath of god god breathed into him and made him a different man he was born again we could say in type but when god looked down at him he didn't have a past though his past could walk up and talk to him hi dad how are you ishmael could have done that but in god's great mind he wasn't even attributed to abraham because he was abram's son that's why we should never ever let our past haunt us and we should never think well we just have to live under the burden of what we once did because the blood takes care of it hallelujah you think about it god cannot marry a woman that's got sin in her life i'm talking about the bride of christ he can't so that's why jesus hung there that between heavens and earth that down calvary because he wanted not just to cover your sin he wasn't interested in covering your sin it may be very real in your mind and i heard brother ron spencer say a few years ago god actually allows that that you remain thankful not not to be a grievous weight but you've got to realize i'm not that person that person died he's gone or she's gone i don't know what yo i'm not that person anymore he's liberated me because i'm not under the curse of adam i'm under the blessings of jesus christ our lord hallelujah so he became sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteous of god in him as i said he can't he can't unite himself with a with a with a believer that's got sinner got that sinful nature in their life but the blood takes care of it and in spite of our failures and everything remember if we confess our sin he's faithful and just to forgive us it says in first john 1 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light amen we have fellowship with him and the blood of jesus christ and cleanse us from all sin and the light is the word of the hour and then it says if we confess our sins faithful and just to forgive us our sin so the communion is a i'm just going to wrap up with i know i say that sorry but you are showing the world and i probably this is probably where i come down to every communion service but you think about this you're showing the world he said this is my body which will be broken for you do this remember it's me this is the new testament in my blood drink it as off as you remember me his body was mad more than any man he's going to show love this is love he poured his life out but where did that life go it didn't just bathe the earth and stayed there and come to nothing no the life in the blood comes into the believer hallelujah so now we're making a public testimony i and my sacrifice have become one when you see me you see the lamb because his life is now in me hallelujah it's no longer i that liveth in the flesh but christ that liveth in me amen and because you have i trust by faith become one who's become he found you somewhere he had a reason of doing it hallelujah he became one with you he chose to do that solomon decided or chose to become one with rahab and marry her hallelujah he wasn't ashamed of his wife god's not ashamed of you he's not ashamed of us he's proud we are his victory we are his victory he is we are if i can put it this way we are his finest achievement because here is a people who are born with a free moral agency and their natural birth actually caused them not to seek after god but yet god deposited something on the inside the inside of you before the foundation of the world that in your season the other hunger would come or even from a little child i mean being 11 years old i wanted the jesus to live in my heart no no i had no idea where to find him but there was something in me crying out and in god's season he said i'm not just going to leave you with the cry i'm going to fill the answer the cry hallelujah amen so we are now i trust you are beneficiaries of his death of his burial and his resurrection he chose you just be happy about that your ups and your downs you know he doesn't beat us up because we go down oh we you know we have our wobble us out yeah we get the speed wobbles whatever you want to call it our god has chosen us he can't change his mind and so we can say thank you lord that heaven has touched me because i have a representation in heaven and this is showing so i'm now making gonna make a public declaration that you and i have become one by your spirit that dwells in me don't you love him this evening isn't he wonderful he became sin for us who knew no sin that we might become the be made the righteousness of god in him or i'll say it this
