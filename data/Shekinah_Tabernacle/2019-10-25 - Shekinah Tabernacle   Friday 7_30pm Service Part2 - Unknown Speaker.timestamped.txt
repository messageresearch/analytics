[11:55] 20:1
[12:10] proverbs chapter 21
[12:21] Lester's reverse um as a reverse to the
[12:30] Bible says every way of a man is right
[12:33] in his own eyes but the Lord pondereth
[12:36] the hearts a man a Lord blessed meat of
[12:40] his word you can have your seats
[12:54] amen
[12:57] tonight by the grace of God I want to
[13:00] use for subject the power of choice the
[13:06] power of choice and if I could start by
[13:10] saying it like this
[13:12] everybody in this room today had to make
[13:15] a choice you made a decision on what
[13:20] kind of clothes you were going to put on
[13:21] you know what you're gonna eat which
[13:24] route you were gonna take to get down
[13:26] here some of you made a choice a couple
[13:30] months ago whether or not you were gonna
[13:32] come to this camp you know so God has
[13:36] given us the power of choice and from
[13:39] the first time when God created man he
[13:43] put them in position to make their own
[13:46] choices God is not a God to where he
[13:51] makes us do what he wants us to do
[13:53] God is a lover huh he's not a brute he's
[13:59] not in the business of making us do his
[14:02] will
[14:03] no God could easily strike all of us
[14:07] with the power of submission and we do
[14:10] whatever God wants us to do but that's
[14:13] not really love so God wants us to be in
[14:19] love with him and whatever we do
[14:22] whatever choices we make concerning the
[14:25] kingdom of God it's because we love him
[14:28] hallelujah
[14:29] I don't come to church because I made
[14:32] they come to church I come because I
[14:34] love it
[14:35] I don't sing unto the Lord because
[14:38] somebody making me sing I do it because
[14:40] I love it puh-leeze I live right because
[14:43] I love it I preach the gospel because I
[14:45] love it
[14:47] [Music]
[14:51] you have to make a choice nobody's gonna
[14:56] make you get anything out of the service
[14:58] you have to make a discontent decision
[15:02] to say god I'm choosing you tonight
[15:06] despite what anybody else may say you
[15:09] have to make up your own mind to accept
[15:12] Jesus Christ and everything that comes
[15:15] along with him and let me tell you
[15:20] something
[15:21] choosing Christ is not always easy it's
[15:29] not always easy but it's always
[15:32] gratifying it'll always work out for
[15:37] your good so by choosing Christ you can
[15:42] never make a bad decision
[15:48] holy but I want you to understand that
[15:53] this weekend and even even so tonight
[15:56] you have to make a choice you have to
[16:00] come see I had to make a choice you know
[16:04] even by making a statement of saying I
[16:06] got enough honey I got enough ginger
[16:08] I got enough now I'm making the choice
[16:11] to stand on the word now I'm making a
[16:15] choice and see one thing I want you to
[16:17] understand young people adults
[16:19] one thing about choices your choice
[16:23] really becomes an opportunity through
[16:29] church as far as alaman alaman Eve thank
[16:34] god gave them the ability to make a
[16:37] choice honey God he gives us his word
[16:41] but he doesn't make us obey he puts it
[16:46] in your lap and then he says what are
[16:49] you gonna do with this word I've given
[16:52] you and I want to tell you young people
[16:54] you have to make a choice you're not
[16:59] always gonna be hardly led by your
[17:04] parents but you're gonna have to make a
[17:05] choice
[17:06] and it's just like we say Adam and Eve
[17:08] had to make their choices but you know
[17:11] what the children also had to make that
[17:13] choice when you go and look at Cain and
[17:16] Abel earlier now it was the time for
[17:20] them to make their own conscious
[17:22] decision how they felt about God how
[17:27] what was there a revelation of God when
[17:31] it came to worship see some of your
[17:33] revelation is just let me come to church
[17:36] sit down be nice and quiet and nobody
[17:38] won't bother me and that's alright you
[17:42] can make that choice but does that
[17:45] choice give you an opportunity to
[17:48] experience more of God and some of us we
[17:52] make the choice to come to church and
[17:54] worship
[17:55] honey so if I worship holy then I step
[18:00] into the opportunity of the one I'm
[18:03] worshipping to come down and put me in
[18:06] to a reality so you hurry up you can let
[18:13] your flesh you can make a decision by
[18:16] what your flesh phone or you can make a
[18:18] decision about what your spirit won't
[18:23] and I guarantee you your flesh will
[18:27] never be right cuz your flesh I say I'm
[18:36] tired your flesh will make the choice to
[18:39] be tired and to be disinterested to be
[18:42] discouraged and all these things but
[18:45] your spirit man can hunger for more of
[18:47] God but I wanna I wanna go through the
[18:53] Bible and I wanna just deal with some
[18:55] characters of choice in the power of
[18:59] choice you know they're people in here
[19:02] who's made a choice that changed their
[19:06] life for the rest of their life oh yeah
[19:09] hey man some of us have made good
[19:13] choices some of us have made bad choices
[19:17] oh yeah but now you have the opportunity
[19:20] to make the best choice of your life
[19:25] yeah we made choices we were in the
[19:29] world but those were the good choices
[19:30] but now in the kingdom of God and we can
[19:35] make choices that will lead us straight
[19:38] to God you can make a choice to stand on
[19:43] God's Word and it'll lead you to healing
[19:45] you can take a choice hallelujah to
[19:48] receive Christ as your Savior hallelujah
[19:51] you can make a choice to receive Christ
[19:54] as your deliverer you can do that today
[19:57] and keep the benefit of that choice your
[20:00] choice will become an opportunity
[20:04] Wow you know to be a blessing
[20:40] some of us miss the opportunity to be a
[20:45] blessing cuz we let our flesh get it
[20:48] away hallelujah right now by your aim
[20:52] hands you can present an opportunity to
[20:55] the Word of God but letting the
[20:57] blessings of God come down in this place
[21:01] you ain't man annoys the word that God
[21:05] may come down and show himself but some
[21:13] of us make the choice to remain silent
[21:30] so she's coming he's he's you young
[21:34] people may not understand this but he's
[21:36] come and taking away everything that can
[21:40] hurt me every pain every discouragement
[21:46] every failure God has taken all of that
[21:50] away oh yeah he's giving me the choice
[21:56] to believe in his greatness to believe
[22:00] in his power to believe in Redemption
[22:02] money he's giving me the choice oh yeah
[22:07] to say my god is good
[22:14] and I'm trying to give you the
[22:17] opportunity to experience what I had and
[22:22] what some of these other adults have you
[22:25] make the right choice hallelujah
[22:28] and my opportunity becomes your
[22:30] opportunity you know right now you know
[22:44] we come to camps and we say Saturday
[22:47] night it's gonna be it's gonna be the
[22:54] explosion cuz we're expecting something
[22:57] it always happens on Saturday night why
[23:03] not make the choice to make this night
[23:07] you're not don't wait for another day
[23:12] another hour another minute
[23:15] God says today you hear my voice harden
[23:18] not your heart
[23:21] Moses head hallelujah who be on the Lord
[23:25] he said make your choice Moses and
[23:35] Joshua told the church make a decision
[23:39] one said choose ye this day whom you
[23:42] gonna serve did Elijah the prophet comes
[23:50] and he also tells his church make a
[23:53] choice if it seems evil to serve God you
[23:58] didn't did you serve bail he says what
[24:02] have you come on the Lord's side we want
[24:04] the real God the true God to answer by
[24:07] fire
[24:15] nobody's gonna do it for you look ya'll
[24:21] know oh my feel my help will coming on
[24:25] y'all know how I feel about the Holy
[24:28] Ghost receiving the Holy Ghost is a
[24:33] choice but it's the best choice you
[24:36] could ever make it's better than Krispy
[24:41] Kreme Doughnuts oh yeah it's better oh
[24:45] my it's better than a nice organic
[24:50] ginger beer y'all know I like curry but
[24:57] it's better than lamb curry with
[25:00] potatoes and spicy this choice the
[25:05] choice of Jesus Christ hallelujah gives
[25:08] you an opportunity to go to heaven hurry
[25:11] and beat his presence forever
[25:14] the choice of Jesus Christ gives you the
[25:18] opportunity to look at demon powers and
[25:21] say you got no right in me why not make
[25:27] your choice to seek to receive Jesus
[25:30] tonight or you can sit back
[25:52] hallelujah Church we look in the
[25:55] scripture as far as Cain and Abel God
[26:00] throws little boys he's okay so Adam and
[26:03] Eve say the day I want you to let the
[26:06] boys go to church by themselves and let
[26:09] the boys worship me by the sense
[26:12] mama daddy stay home I want to see what
[26:16] these boys think of me now I want to see
[26:20] their choices of worship
[26:22] I can tell what's in your heart
[26:27] by the way you worship I can tell what's
[26:32] going to home but how you respond to the
[26:35] word honey talking about the music how
[26:38] do you talk about the worship of music I
[26:39] was about to worship of the word cuz
[26:45] music will faint but the word is eternal
[26:53] and we can tell if you have an
[26:56] experience with God but a choice you
[27:00] make of worship you look at Cana name I
[27:05] was familiar with Cain and Abel but we
[27:08] want to look at their choice you know
[27:11] Abel came probably said you know cuz I
[27:13] believe Kane came probably came out
[27:14] first and you know he probably thought
[27:16] he was better than Abel please he came
[27:19] out he came to worship he probably told
[27:21] Abel let me show you how it's done
[27:23] oh look at his choice it was something
[27:30] nice and pretty
[31:12] that means it was never God because God
[31:16] is love
[31:21] now think about your choices if it's God
[31:27] it can never fail I told her I said girl
[31:36] that's going to preach in the next day I
[31:41] appreciate at a church but I can't what
[31:44] accredit God holy is love he meant love
[31:53] never faileth heylia
[31:55] so if it fails if you make a choice to
[31:59] love and it fails that means it was
[32:02] never God in the first place if you make
[32:06] a choice to do something and it fails
[32:08] that means it was never God in the first
[32:10] place why because God cannot fail we
[32:20] would take a poll right here tonight and
[32:23] say by show of hands how many of us has
[32:26] God never failed me I don't see has he
[32:31] ever failed you
[32:33] has he ever come up short anybody nobody
[32:38] so that mean just should be a
[32:41] supernatural visitation tonight
[32:46] because we all believe that there is no
[32:50] failure in God so as a collective group
[32:55] tonight we're making a choice to believe
[32:58] in the supernatural we'll make it a
[33:01] choice to believe that all things are
[33:05] possible if you don't know God tonight
[33:10] you need an atmosphere where all things
[33:13] are possible if you got struggles in
[33:16] your life you're in an atmosphere where
[33:18] all things are possible if you're sick
[33:22] in your body you're in a happy sphere
[33:24] where healing is here you know the price
[33:26] hallelujah the freedom of God is here in
[33:32] this atmosphere you just got to make a
[33:34] choice to receive it cuz we can't give
[33:42] it to you taking God and His Word is a
[33:50] conscious decision you know like I said
[33:53] you know how I feel about the Holy Ghost
[33:55] I have the Holy Ghost in bottles or in
[34:01] jugs and lying all y'all up one by one
[34:07] and get some mugs call the priestess I
[34:10] know we gonna pray we're gonna give me
[34:12] the whole that goes tonight wouldn't
[34:16] that would not be wonderful
[34:18] wouldn't that be quite lovely if we look
[34:23] at our children and say tonight I'm
[34:26] gonna give you the Holy Ghost whether
[34:30] you like it or not I'm gonna make you

[46:03] God is the best thing you could ever do
[46:17] Church let me tell you something let me
[46:26] tell you people something about this God
[46:28] we serve every every day I try to get
[46:32] something to myself so if I can find it
[46:52] in the word that means we serve a God
[47:32] that knows no failure we serve a God
[47:37] that whenever he steps into battle he
[47:41] has a guaranteed policy guaranteed to
[47:48] win guaranteed to come out also
[47:54] guaranteed to produce victory that's who
[47:59] we serve I've made a choice to serve a
[48:02] god that cannot lie and he cannot fail
[48:06] [Music]
[48:16] you know sitting in the house I was
[48:18] saying that to myself god I know you
[48:20] can't I know you can't fail and then he
[48:22] dropped something missing my spirit that
[48:24] goes along with that if God can't lie
[48:27] and God can't fail you know what else
[48:29] brothers do God does not worry so
[48:35] parents you don't have to worry about
[48:36] your children all you have to do is
[48:40] claim never claim them in the name of
[48:43] Jesus Christ call their name now hug
[48:46] by the token make the choice to apply
[48:50] the token of the blood of the Lamb to
[48:54] your whole household what we do we look
[48:58] at conditions and we make choices based
[49:02] upon what we see you ever been going
[49:07] down the road and you see a traffic jam
[49:19] different direction
[49:20] you wait five minutes so that knows the
[49:24] person to get out of the way the traffic
[49:26] was going smooth but you miss the
[49:29] opportunity to get there quicker because
[49:32] you didn't have enough patience to wait
[49:33] oh yeah
[49:37] stop making impulsive decisions and pray
[49:42] about things and let God lead you to the
[49:45] right choice
[49:57] cuz I want to give you an opportunity to
[50:00] make a choice
[50:04] let's go back to the boys Cain and Abel
[50:07] King he didn't brought all this stuff of
[50:10] the flesh to God in the Bible says God
[50:17] refused it you know why he refused it
[50:22] because God couldn't see himself in that
[50:27] worship
[51:03] all the greatest mysteries is receiving
[51:05] the Holy Ghost without sensation
[51:18] that may be all right for you but I like
[51:26] a little motion in church
[51:33] I like a little fire in church
[51:38] Church we're not at no ball game we're
[51:42] not into some concert
[51:44] so how emotion is spiritual emotion
[51:49] this is good emotion we're not excited
[51:51] earlier about the rugby game or some our
[51:55] excitement it's about the Word of God
[51:57] how excitement is about this atmosphere
[52:00] so why can't we have a little emotion if
[52:04] it's the right kind of a mossad and for
[52:12] those of you who need a quote the
[52:14] prophet of God said when the Holy Ghost
[52:16] comes it breaks our motion they also
[52:24] have a wildfire
[52:26] there's no fire at all but what we try
[52:38] to do is make everybody's experience the
[52:40] same I might wanna say
[53:01] I might want to do a backflip up here
[53:06] you know what I like about if I do it
[53:17] the old wonder whether is God and that
[53:19] is me and God God the only one know if
[53:22] I'm putting on because he knows what
[53:28] kind of life i'ma live I do that back
[53:31] asleep so make the choice to leave it
[53:38] alone robot was the messenger y'all know
[54:04] what is the most radical people in
[54:07] church was brother Brett - MS o now well

[55:39] [Applause]
[55:41] worship is in the pipe hoe emotion is in
[55:46] the pipe hope is that wasn't good enough
[55:54] God made the choice to destroy that
[55:58] thought and think God took him to David
[56:00] hallelujah and he said David saw the Ark
[56:03] of the Covenant on its way it wasn't
[56:06] even there yet and David began to dance
[56:10] and David begin to worship why because

[1:00:05] yer gods occurred to me for me to
[1:00:17] be silent
[1:00:23] and when your kids get on board dare
[1:00:26] defend you with somebody else talking
[1:00:28] trash then one day I told them but
[1:00:31] you're not and that time supposed to be
[1:00:37] Fraser my daughter and my daughter read
[1:00:45] her lips leave my daddy alone let him
[1:00:57] shout let him dance let him watch up
[1:01:01] that's who he is
[1:01:04] and besides you need to shut up do kids
[1:01:18] know if you fake it or not
[1:01:29] well it's we saw king worship
[1:01:33] it's worse than was something of the
[1:01:35] earth but Abel made a choice to be led
[1:01:39] by the spirit and it didn't look right
[1:01:43] can you see him I will show you how
[1:01:45] powerful his choice for he wouldn't got
[1:01:48] a lamb he walking to go worship and you
[1:01:54] know Mom and Dad it was looking now mom
[1:01:57] and daddy you know they couldn't go
[1:01:58] window but they saw him going to worship
[1:02:01] they couldn't all the worship for
[1:02:03] them but they saw it
[1:02:05] now here comes honey they didn't watch
[1:02:07] Cain and God they rejected Cain now he
[1:02:10] comes Abel making his choice he comes
[1:02:12] with that lamb then he just the lamb
[1:02:16] kind of nice everything look all cute
[1:02:19] pretty nice and clean you know that'd be
[1:02:25] a perfect you know why cuz God had to
[1:02:29] see himself in that hole in that choice
[1:02:32] colors
[1:02:34] so now Abel everything he's doing he's
[1:02:36] doing it by inspiration who was making
[1:02:40] his choice God Church look he grabs the
[1:02:46] lamp
[1:02:47] across come across he turns around with
[1:02:51] a rocket shooting everywhere now oh yeah
[1:02:59] Kings really like if God didn't accept
[1:03:08] my pretty fruit I know he's not gonna
[1:03:11] set your mess but how many knows the
[1:03:15] Holy Ghost is a mess the birth coming to
[1:03:19] a birth is a mess
[1:03:21] oh yeah but once you come into that
[1:03:23] birth he's sorry warning it's so
[1:03:28] gratifying it's so sweet and pleasant
[1:03:32] once you come to that birth
[1:03:38] judging he's done hacking and blood
[1:03:40] start squirting everywhere and Eve
[1:03:42] grabbed him by the hand because you
[1:03:56] young people get your own experience
[1:03:58] with God God will show you things that
[1:04:01] mom and daddy didn't tell you you have
[1:04:05] your own experience with God cuz you
[1:04:09] make the right choice you look a blood
[1:04:14] squirting everywhere did you tell him
[1:04:35] skin cuz their choice was religion fig
[1:04:40] leaves just like cane something of the
[1:04:45] flesh oh yeah
[1:04:47] but Abel saw your choice was called the
[1:04:50] mind of God just like he did for Adam
[1:04:52] and Eve huh he wrapped him in skin
[1:04:55] dripping with blood no he knows offer a
[1:05:07] blood it's his own choice sacrifice
[1:05:21] why huh Leah because he seized the
[1:05:24] moment he seized opportunity honey to be
[1:05:28] a type of Christ and that's what happens
[1:05:35] will you make the right choice you
[1:05:37] become a type of the bride in Christ in
[1:05:41] his relationship but to come down Oh
[1:05:52] different ones had to make a choice
[1:05:55] Esther had to make a choice I say I had
[1:06:00] to make a choice John had to make a
[1:06:02] choice Jesus
[1:06:12] he led by example because I remember his
[1:06:17] flesh didn't wanna die his flesh had
[1:06:20] been beaten and whipped
[1:06:22] more than the other man honey but he had
[1:06:24] to make a choice huh
[1:06:26] what was his choice he saw all of us he
[1:06:33] made a choice to die
[1:06:35] so that we could him so why don't we die
[1:06:37] so he can live young people Christ died
[1:06:47] so that you can have the choice to live
[1:06:50] so why don't you die so Christ can live
[1:06:54] through you who make the right choice
[1:07:17] listen I want you to think about your
[1:07:20] choices you know properly God said it's
[1:07:24] not God's will that anybody go to hell
[1:07:32] he has no pleasure net remember God is a
[1:07:39] lover he's not a brute she's not a beast
[1:07:42] the Bible say what we think to be
[1:07:45] slackness concern and God has gotten
[1:07:47] long-serving
[1:07:48] long-suffering hug because he don't want
[1:07:51] to see nobody perish but he want to see
[1:07:53] everybody safe but he knows who's gonna
[1:07:56] make the right choice honey but a
[1:07:59] prophet of God say God listen listen
[1:08:02] good he says God let me read it
[1:08:06] listen he said it's not necessary that
[1:08:09] any man will go to hell what's God
[1:08:35] doesn't have a desire to see people burn
[1:08:38] in hell hell was created for the devil
[1:08:41] and his angels not for any of you none
[1:08:48] of you God didn't create hell were you
[1:08:51] in mine so if you find yourself in hell
[1:09:01] it was your choice
[1:09:12] it's not necessary
[1:09:15] we'll go to him thank God don't see no
[1:09:18] one to help you send yourself to hell
[1:09:23] God don't God done everything in the
[1:09:27] world he can keep you from going to hell
[1:09:30] and yet you're determined to go to this
[1:09:37] little prophecies he says you fight over
[1:09:40] every barricade God says don't do that
[1:09:45] you say I want him I want him so much
[1:09:51] because he's hot and God tells you don't
[1:09:55] do it he barricaded he makes it so hard
[1:09:58] for you to get next to that serpent you
[1:10:05] kick the barricade down cuz you in your
[1:10:09] feelings don't do it
[1:10:22] are you making the wrong choice you bust
[1:10:27] through the barricade when God is trying
[1:10:29] to stop you let me say this when we as
[1:10:37] an individual all of us when we are
[1:10:40] doing wrong we already know you know by
[1:10:49] the choice you make if I can say it like
[1:10:53] this Church
[1:10:53] oh yeah God doesn't condemn you you
[1:10:56] condemn yourself by the choices you make
[1:11:01] before I turn into the guy you see now I
[1:11:06] was like some of you sitting in church
[1:11:35] I'm gonna drop a dime on you now drop a
[1:11:39] dime on some you children so are you
[1:11:41] young people let me tell you Paris
[1:11:43] something if you don't see the fruit of
[1:11:47] the Holy Spirit in their life that means
[1:11:50] they're dancing with the enemy because
[1:11:56] you can only serve one master and if you
[1:11:59] don't see the fruits of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:01] that means they're entertaining of
[1:12:04] spirits so stop being all girly boy
[1:12:09] every time oh he's such a nice boy do
[1:12:12] you see the Spirit of God and if they're
[1:12:17] not producing the life of Christ that
[1:12:20] means something else is going on inside
[1:12:22] something else is going only they mind
[1:12:25] something else is going on anybody but
[1:12:34] if you ain't producing my life that
[1:12:36] means you dancing with something else
[1:12:51] they go happen you sit at home sneaking
[1:12:54] listening to the Meagles
[1:12:55] ain't go what is the car to be what you
[1:13:12] don't know but your children do it's the
[1:13:22] spirit you got in your house and they
[1:13:25] mostly in everybody's house the spirit
[1:13:27] that we're aware of it's called YouTube
[1:13:30] I hate to use this type but I'm gonna
[1:13:45] use it I feel gosh every spirit
[1:14:00] will mature have you nibbling and Ibelin
[1:14:05] with the devil
[1:14:06] it will mature to a full demon you know
[1:14:15] I was talkin me my daughter was talking
[1:14:18] you know she's not a drug user but I was
[1:14:20] just I was just dropping some knowledge
[1:14:22] or I was like look they don't even
[1:14:24] understand what's happening nowadays all
[1:14:26] of us make marijuana legal and all this
[1:14:28] stuff and they did it our way
[1:14:36] they making the holy stuff legal but
[1:14:38] what I want you to understand the
[1:14:40] marijuana they smoking is not real it's
[1:14:45] made in a laboratory it's synthetic
[1:14:49] because anything real comes from a seed
[1:14:53] and the stuff that they smoking now it
[1:14:57] doesn't come from a seed it's something
[1:14:59] produced and made in a laboratory so
[1:15:01] what kind of effect it's gonna have on
[1:15:04] them when they start smoking it it
[1:15:05] becomes an addiction but that's how
[1:15:21] start real simple real easy if you make
[1:15:31] that choice you make the wrong choice
[1:15:39] all the stuff that's going on now is
[1:15:45] original everything is a byproduct
[1:15:48] everything is something that the devil
[1:15:51] has perverted even your fun you have to
[1:15:56] make the right choice I'm gonna play
[1:16:00] Connect four
[1:16:03] what's the basis of Connect for making
[1:16:07] the right choice but if you really pay
[1:16:13] attention to the game the game is always
[1:16:17] about your next choice so you make a
[1:16:24] move to set yourself up for the next
[1:16:26] move in the next move for the next move
[1:16:29] and not only are you playing office but
[1:16:32] your grant defense everything about
[1:16:34] Connect four is about the next choice
[1:16:36] not only your choice but the choice of
[1:16:39] your enemy also so you need to look at
[1:16:44] hallelujah what you're doing the choices
[1:16:46] you're making your choices just don't
[1:16:48] affect you but it'll affect the people
[1:16:53] you close to you know affect your mom
[1:16:56] and dad either people in your house so
[1:16:58] you have to make choices you have to
[1:16:59] make the next room move earlier that
[1:17:02] works out for the good of everybody that
[1:17:04] loves you because just like honey
[1:17:10] playing Monopoly you make their own
[1:17:12] choice you find yourself in jail mostly
[1:17:18] every game you can play it's about
[1:17:45] Oh
[1:17:48] he says and yet you determined to go to
[1:17:51] hell you fight every barricade God puts
[1:17:55] in your way
[1:17:55] you just go right on over it don't
[1:17:58] believe in this and I don't believe in
[1:18:00] that and I don't believe in this just
[1:18:04] don't reason with the Word of God
[1:18:08] because the word is not going and I
[1:18:14] wanted to start the meeting with this
[1:18:17] vote because your choice tonight it will
[1:18:24] dictate the rest of your meeting
[1:18:30] you can leave out here closer to God was
[1:18:47] presented with the same situation all of
[1:18:54] you tonight are being presented with the
[1:18:56] same situation either you know God oh

[1:24:25] Rahab she made a choice that I don't
[1:24:29] want to be a prostitute no more I want
[1:24:31] to be in the body of Christ and God

[1:50:14] few years like since I was 14 or so I've
[1:50:18] been really struggling with like
[1:50:20] pornography and sexual desires and stuff
[1:50:23] like that and I sometimes I always felt
[1:50:30] so bad like sometimes I didn't know
[1:50:33] where to go afterwards but it's amazing
[1:50:37] how we sang that song of how great is
[1:50:40] our God because he is great
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:54] many of you may have known about the
[1:50:57] Brisbane youth camp and that's when God
[1:51:01] delivered me from the pornography and
[1:51:03] stuff like that but I've always
[1:51:06] struggled with sexual desires and the
[1:51:11] guiltiness of it and this weekend and
[1:51:16] this week on Wednesday me and my mum I
[1:51:19] was talking to my mom about it and I
[1:51:23] asked my mom for pray and she kept
[1:51:26] prayed for me then and then we started
[1:51:30] talking about how stuff happens and
[1:51:34] stuff like that and then my mom told me
[1:51:37] about this quote that brother Brahim
[1:51:40] said about with the scroll and they eat
[1:51:43] oh that always chatta chatta chatta Din
[1:51:44] to the eagle and then when the eagle had
[1:51:47] enough it just took off and with but
[1:51:53] also was that which really amazed me is
[1:51:55] on Wednesday night when we're a church
[1:51:58] we always have these pre-service slides
[1:52:02] and the first slide was that quote and I
[1:52:07] I couldn't believe it and and then
[1:52:10] brother Ari talked about enslaved and I
[1:52:15] couldn't like sometimes I can I'm so
[1:52:19] speechless of how great is our God
[1:52:22] and
[1:52:34] and when he was preaching they was at
[1:52:39] Versailles can't completely remember it
[1:52:44] by my son who sound like that his son
[1:52:48] say it's free you are free indeed and
[1:52:51] when I heard that I felt all of that
[1:52:55] goat and sexual desires leave me just
[1:52:57] that instance
[1:53:06] but after the service when I talked to
[1:53:08] my mom and dad about it what has she
[1:53:11] been with my mom and and she was happy
[1:53:16] with me and but she told me that even
[1:53:21] though you have been released from it
[1:53:23] Satan will come back and try put that
[1:53:26] back on you
[1:53:27] and she told me that there's power and
[1:53:30] the power of confession so every single
[1:53:34] time when Satan comes to me with that I
[1:53:36] always say that first of them and these
[1:53:40] two songs as well when I get those
[1:53:42] thoughts I may not remember all the
[1:53:45] words but thank God I am free free free
