[32:53] prepare your hearts unto the lord and
[32:55] serve him only
[32:56] and he will deliver you out of the hand

[33:34] samuel cease
[33:36] not to cry out unto the lord our god for
[33:38] us that he will save us out of the hand
[33:40] of the philistines and samuel took a
[33:42] suckling lamb and offered it for a burnt
[33:44] offering holy unto the lord and samuel
[33:47] cried unto the lord for israel and the
[33:50] lord heard him
[33:51] and as samuel was offering up the burnt
[33:53] offering the philistines drew near to
[33:56] battle against israel but the lord
[33:57] thundered with a great thunder on that
[33:59] day upon the philistines and and
[34:01] discomforted them
[34:03] and they were smitten before israel and
[34:06] the men of israel went out to
[34:09] mizpah and pursued the philistines and
[34:11] smote them until they came unto bethka

[36:03] god bless you trust you're having a
[36:05] wonderful lockdown birthday there god
[36:06] bless you my friend amen praise the lord
[36:09] let's um so
[36:11] uh so i'm just opening my notes so i'm
[36:13] looking at you on my computer i've got
[36:14] my notes on my phone i've got my bible
[36:16] open so multitasking can be a struggle
[36:19] even uh well it is for me but anyway i'd
[36:21] like to speak about our god
[36:23] is our rock of revelation now i want you
[36:26] to notice here that israel as they were
[36:28] coming to you know coming back to the
[36:30] lord they had the vindicated prophet
[36:32] there on the scene and and it's it's
[36:35] always amazing when when man begins to
[36:37] decide to serve god and put away other
[36:39] guys that the enemy comes in to try and
[36:41] destroy them now here they were they
[36:44] they they cried out
[36:46] and and we read here that samuel offered
[36:49] a um a suckling lamb called out to the
[36:52] lord and then they you know our
[36:54] and then the lord came down and fought
[36:56] the battle for them that it was god
[36:59] supernaturally delivering israel now we
[37:01] know that our god
[37:03] is our rock
[37:05] right here's our revelation so during
[37:07] the service when i talk about our god
[37:09] think of revelation right because he is
[37:12] the the rock that the church is built
[37:15] upon is divine
[37:17] revelation so i want you to notice so so
[37:20] um samuel put this rock here called um
[37:24] you know he put the stone here between
[37:25] mizpah and shen and called its name
[37:28] ebenezer which is you know the lord has
[37:30] helped us so it's called the rock of
[37:32] help now
[37:33] their god was always a rock of help he
[37:35] always was a god that delivered a god
[37:37] that you know fought their battles but
[37:39] god and every generation wanted to
[37:41] reveal that to the people and and um as
[37:45] as we'll go through this we'll see that
[37:46] the same god for the battles for joshua
[37:48] amen has fought the battles for israel
[37:51] here with samuel and he's the same god
[37:53] today now brother braham says in the
[37:55] church age book now now he's speaking of
[37:58] um when when god showed him who the
[38:00] messengers to every age was every star
[38:02] to every age but
[38:04] this is a keystone for the whole bible
[38:06] he says the key given me of the lord
[38:08] when i was able to determine the
[38:10] messenger for each age is the most
[38:12] scriptural one
[38:14] in fact it might be called the keystone
[38:16] of of the bible
[38:18] it is the revelation that god never
[38:20] changes and that his ways are as
[38:23] unchanging as he is in hebrews 13 8 it
[38:26] says jesus christ the same yesterday
[38:29] today and forever ecclesiastes 3 14 i
[38:34] know that whatsoever god doeth it shall
[38:36] be forever nothing can be put to it
[38:39] neither can any anything be taken from
[38:41] it and god doeth it that men should fear
[38:44] before him
[38:46] that which hath been is now and that
[38:49] which is to be hath already been and god
[38:52] require requireth
[38:54] that which is past here it is an
[38:56] unchanging god with unchanging ways what
[38:59] he did at the first he will have to keep
[39:01] on doing until he is done for the last
[39:04] time there will never be a change so our
[39:07] god is a great unchanging god and that
[39:09] was brother brahms you could say
[39:11] rallying cry was jesus christ the same
[39:14] yesterday today and forever but so he's
[39:16] the same god as i said he's the same god
[39:18] that fought the battles for joshua and
[39:20] the children of israel taking the land
[39:22] was the same god that fought the battles
[39:24] there amen for for samuel and israel at
[39:27] mizpah but it had to become a revelation
[39:29] to the to that generation that their god
[39:33] was still alive that he still fought
[39:34] their battle see it was no good for them
[39:36] to have a historical god they had to
[39:38] have a god that was real to them a god
[39:40] of realities and it's the same thing
[39:42] with you and i you know our life is
[39:44] built upon divine revelation amen amen
[39:47] that divine revelation is what the
[39:49] church is built upon and so we can say
[39:51] our god is our rock amen and a rock is a
[39:54] revelation in the scripture now i just
[39:56] want to read here
[39:58] um as i said he you know he never
[39:59] changes now we read in the opening
[40:01] scripture that the lord
[40:04] um this discomforted the philistines and
[40:07] they were smitten before israel now god
[40:09] had god had already done this before
[40:12] because remember he's the unchanging god
[40:14] so in exodus 14
[40:16] it says here now moses would tell the
[40:18] people of the red sea he would say fear
[40:20] ye not stand still and see the salvation
[40:22] of the lord which he will show to you
[40:24] today for the egyptians whom you have
[40:25] seen today you shall see them again no
[40:28] more forever the lord shall fight for
[40:30] you and you shall hold your peace so now
[40:33] god was revealing himself as the god who
[40:35] fought the people's battles amen he's
[40:38] the one who steps on the scene and
[40:39] fights the battle supernaturally and
[40:41] then we come forward now 40 odd years
[40:43] down the road from exodus 14 and joshua
[40:46] and the children of israel are in the
[40:48] land and joshua says here
[40:51] uh there's joshua 10 and 8 and the lord
[40:53] said unto joshua fear them not for i
[40:55] have delivered them into thine hand
[40:57] there shall not a man of them stand
[40:59] before thee joshua therefore came unto
[41:02] them suddenly and went up from gilgal
[41:04] all night and the lord discomforted them
[41:07] just the same same action
[41:09] discomforted them before israel and slew
[41:12] them with a great slaughter at gibeon
[41:14] and chased them along the way that goth
[41:16] up to
[41:17] betheron and smote them at asaka and
[41:20] unto
[41:21] machida and it came to pass as they fled
[41:24] from before israel and were in going
[41:26] down to betharan the lord cast down
[41:28] great stones from from heaven upon them
[41:32] unto azakuba and they died and there
[41:34] were more which died with half stones
[41:36] than they whom the children of israel
[41:38] slew with the sword so the same god that
[41:41] discomforted the enemy there in joshua's
[41:43] day was the same god that fought the
[41:44] battle there for the israelites against
[41:46] the philistines and at them and there
[41:48] was a great victory
[41:51] he's the same god today he's here to
[41:52] fight our battles we're not alone in
[41:54] this walk by ourselves
[41:57] jesus would ask the question now we know
[42:00] this is very fundamental but but i trust
[42:02] you can uh you know i trust her be a
[42:04] blessing to you where jesus would ask
[42:07] his disciples in matthew 16. he would
[42:09] ask the question who do men say that i
[42:11] am and they would respond some say that
[42:14] you are john the baptist or elias or one
[42:16] of the prophets but then that that
[42:19] answer the lord was uh i mean i mean the
[42:21] answer they gave him wasn't really what
[42:23] he wanted because he said but who do you
[42:25] say
[42:26] so jesus knew
[42:27] um you know
[42:28] they knew he was some kind of prophet
[42:30] this is this is who men say he was he's
[42:32] a prophet because they could see the
[42:34] life of elias of jeremiah or one of the
[42:36] prophets they could see that life being
[42:38] manifested in jesus christ because there
[42:40] was a portion of god and all those
[42:42] prophets but jesus rules the fullness of
[42:43] the god here bodily so a part of what
[42:46] was manifested there in in the prophets
[42:48] was manifest in its fullness in jesus
[42:50] christ but then jesus asked the question
[42:52] but who do you say that i am
[42:55] and simon peter says thou art the christ
[42:57] the son of the living god
[42:59] and jesus answered and said unto him
[43:01] bless out thou simon by jonah for flesh
[43:03] and blood has not revealed this to you
[43:05] um but my father which is in heaven and
[43:08] i say to thee upon this rock i'll build
[43:10] he said and i sent him thou art peter
[43:12] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[43:14] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[43:16] against them and i will give unto thee
[43:18] the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[43:20] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[43:21] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[43:23] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[43:25] loosed in heaven so remember the whole
[43:28] subject of this of this
[43:30] conversation is revelation what's been
[43:33] revealed to the people who do they say i
[43:36] am so in other words what has
[43:38] you know what as the conclusion that's
[43:40] come to them of who i am
[43:42] what has been revealed to them and they
[43:44] said well he must be one of the prophets
[43:45] but but that wasn't
[43:48] you know the real revelation of who
[43:49] jesus was because remember he is the
[43:50] image of the invisible god so so simon
[43:54] peter was asked well they asked who but
[43:56] who do you say that i am and simon peter
[43:59] said thou art the christ so it's all
[44:01] about revelation and then jesus says
[44:04] listen thou simon by jonah for flesh and
[44:06] blood has not revealed this to you so so
[44:08] the culture or the or the all the um you
[44:11] know gossip or what people said about me
[44:14] that that didn't reveal to you who i was
[44:16] but my father in heaven has revealed
[44:18] this to you so it's divine revelation
[44:20] upon this rock right the divine
[44:22] revelation of who jesus christ is i will
[44:25] build my church and the gates of hell
[44:27] shall not prevail against it so this is
[44:30] this is god's pattern he takes the
[44:32] people and he builds upon the divine
[44:34] revelation of who he is in their season
[44:36] man because he's the same yesterday
[44:38] today and forever and he is his word and
[44:40] those people who are built upon the
[44:42] divine revelation of who jesus christ is
[44:45] amen not was is right now amen that is
[44:49] the church that god has built and the
[44:51] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[44:53] them and they've been given power to
[44:55] bind things upon earth and they'll be
[44:57] bound in heaven and whatever they are
[44:59] loose on earth it shall be loosed in
[45:01] heaven so this is the divine the church
[45:04] is built upon divine revelation who's
[45:06] following me so far i mean so if god has
[45:09] revealed to you who he is in this season
[45:12] you're a very blessed person amen amen
[45:14] money didn't give it to you you're in
[45:16] selective it didn't give it to you your
[45:18] family didn't give it to you god gave it
[45:20] to you yes hallelujah and if god is
[45:22] building upon this divine rock of
[45:24] revelation the devil can't kick you off
[45:26] it that's right amen
[45:28] hallelujah
[45:29] now david wood david would speak in in
[45:32] many places and we'll go through them
[45:34] where he would attribute god as his rock
[45:38] because remember david was anointed by
[45:40] that same prophet samuel that that that
[45:42] raised up um the ebenezer stone there
[45:45] the rock of help you know he was
[45:46] anointed by that same vindicated prophet
[45:49] and that same prophet anointed him for
[45:51] the purpose that he was going to sit on
[45:52] the throne he was going to be king of
[45:54] israel that was where david was going to
[45:56] end up
[45:57] and so david went through many hard
[45:59] times in life he would be on the run
[46:00] from saul he would have to go live among
[46:02] the philistines and you know even one
[46:05] time he'd have to act crazy you know
[46:07] before the kingdom just to try and
[46:08] survive and you know he was a fugitive
[46:10] in his own land but yet he had a
[46:12] revelation in his life
[46:14] amen i mean that he was going to be king
[46:16] that he was coming into power and this
[46:18] revelation no matter how bad life got he
[46:21] could always go back to that moment amen
[46:23] where the lord anointed him through the
[46:25] prophet samuel vindicated prophet poured
[46:28] out as a lord of anointing oil upon his
[46:30] head and says the spirit of god i mean
[46:32] yeah yeah the spirit of god was with
[46:34] david from that day on he could always
[46:36] go back to that moment amen and when he
[46:38] would get into the spirit that same god
[46:40] that was there when he was commissioned
[46:41] he was anointed i mean to become king
[46:44] that same god was with him hallelujah
[46:47] and so it didn't matter really how bad
[46:49] situations of life got for david his god
[46:52] amen was a divine revelation to him his
[46:55] god is his rock hallelujah it should be
[46:57] the same thing with you and i friends it
[46:59] doesn't matter how bad life gets or
[47:01] struggles or trials come in amen but we
[47:04] can always go back to that time when the
[47:06] word came upon us hallelujah his
[47:08] anointing came upon us quicken that
[47:10] quickened us to the promise of this hour
[47:12] and he made us new creatures in christ
[47:14] and that is our rock that our life is
[47:16] built upon
[47:17] holy amen amen he would say this in
[47:20] second samuel 22
[47:22] amen and david spake unto the lord the
[47:25] words of this song in the day that the
[47:27] lord had delivered him out of the hand
[47:28] of all his enemies and out of the
[47:31] hand of saul and he said the lord is my
[47:34] rock
[47:35] and my fortress and my deliverer
[47:38] amen she said the lord is my revelation
[47:41] amen he's been divinely revealed to me
[47:43] he's made himself known to me and he's
[47:45] my fortress and my delivery you see when
[47:48] the lord reveals himself to someone amen
[47:50] he becomes not only
[47:53] a you know so so he's the rock that
[47:55] you're built upon but he's also a
[47:57] fortress he's a place of defense
[48:00] hallelujah and he's also becomes a
[48:02] deliverer it means remember the god that
[48:04] saved you is going to keep you i mean
[48:06] the god that saved you is going to
[48:07] deliver you out of every fear
[48:09] hallelujah the scripture says that the
[48:10] angel of the lord isn't kept about those
[48:12] who fear him and he delivers them
[48:15] amen there's going to be spots in life
[48:17] where we're going to need deliverance
[48:18] we're gonna need god to come upon the
[48:20] scene but he promised he'll come on the
[48:21] scene and then he'll fight our battles
[48:23] and he will deliver us amen what a god
[48:26] we serve
[48:27] hallelujah
[48:28] amen amen
[48:30] the
[48:30] the god of my rock and him will i trust
[48:33] he is my shield and the horn of my
[48:35] salvation my high tower and my refuge my
[48:38] savior thou saveth me from violence i
[48:42] will call on the lord
[48:44] who is worthy to be praised so shall i
[48:47] be saved from my enemies the lord liveth
[48:50] and blessed be my rock and exalted be
[48:53] the god of the rock of my salvation so
[48:56] amen blessed be my revelation that the
[48:58] lord's imparted to me remember if if god
[49:00] gave it the world can't take it away
[49:02] amen because the world didn't give this
[49:04] to us friends it wasn't someone who who
[49:06] explained you into
[49:08] i mean the message of the hour it was
[49:10] the lord jesus christ revealed himself
[49:13] personally to you
[49:15] amen so he is my rock and exalted be the
[49:18] god of the revelation of my salvation
[49:21] you see if god reveals himself to you
[49:23] and i it makes us act different it makes
[49:25] us conduct ourselves differently it
[49:27] makes us be a different kind of people
[49:29] because we realize we're not from this
[49:30] terra firma we're not from this world
[49:32] we're from another world and we're just
[49:34] passing through this world but we're
[49:36] going to leave and go amen
[49:38] we can say we came from god and we go
[49:40] back to god hallelujah hallelujah that
[49:42] should be our revelation amen they
[49:44] should be anchored in our heart now
[49:46] remember the lord
[49:48] all right let's just keep reading here i
[49:49] don't want to get ahead of myself and
[49:51] now we drop down to verse 47 of second
[49:53] samuel 22 the lord liveth and blessed be
[49:55] my rock and exalted be the god of the
[49:59] rock of my salvation it is god that

[50:06] forth from my enemies thou also has
[50:09] lifted up my uh lifted me up on high
[50:13] above them that rose against me thou has
[50:15] delivered me from the violent man amen
[50:18] that's what revelation does yeah i mean
[50:20] it lifts us up that we realize that we
[50:23] are not subject anymore to the devil and
[50:26] to his works and to his schemes and to
[50:28] his devices but we've been lifted up
[50:30] into heavenly places in christ jesus
[50:32] amen far above all principality and
[50:34] power and his spiritual wickedness it
[50:36] works in high places and that's what
[50:38] revelation does it lifts us up i mean
[50:40] changes us that we realize hey we're not
[50:42] subject to the devil anymore we're not
[50:44] subject to our past anymore we're not
[50:46] subject to this flesh anymore amen we
[50:48] are subject to the spirit of god that
[50:49] dwells within us amen hallelujah amen if
[50:52] you can you know if that anchors into
[50:54] our heart you can say satan back off in
[50:56] the name of jesus christ get out of here
[50:58] you don't belong here you're not welcome
[51:00] here get out in the name of jesus christ
[51:02] and he has to obey you amen amen psalm
[51:05] 61 and 1 hear my cry oh lord attendant
[51:08] to my prayer
[51:09] from the end of the earth will i cry
[51:11] unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[51:14] lead me to the rock
[51:16] that is higher than i am amen for thou
[51:18] has been a shelter for me and a strong
[51:20] tower from the enemy i will abide in thy
[51:22] tabernacle forever i will trust in the
[51:25] covet of thy wings
[51:27] sealer see i think i said it a few
[51:29] sundays ago but i just want to repeat it
[51:31] you know god knew that our hearts our
[51:33] emotions would get overwhelmed by
[51:35] situations in life where it seems too
[51:38] much and we can't bear it no more and
[51:40] you know things just get too
[51:41] overwhelming amen he knew that that that
[51:44] this would happen to us because he knows
[51:46] how we're built yeah
[51:49] yeah amen
[51:49] mean he doesn't hold our humanity
[51:51] against us
[51:52] he knows exactly how we're built he
[51:54] knows sometimes our emotions will just
[51:56] become too much the situation will get
[51:58] too much grief will become too much
[52:00] anxiety will become too much worry can
[52:02] become too much but we have a place of
[52:04] safety
[52:05] that we can go i mean that will give us
[52:08] a stability in the trial and i believe
[52:11] this is what david's speaking about here
[52:14] he says when my heart is overwhelmed
[52:16] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[52:18] i lead me to the revelation oh god of
[52:21] who i am and you and who you are amen
[52:24] that is higher than my natural
[52:25] circumstances amen so when our hearts
[52:28] get overwhelmed
[52:30] we can be lead to a revelation that's
[52:32] already in our hearts i'm a son of god
[52:35] i'm a daughter of god all things work
[52:37] together for good that love god and are
[52:39] called according to his purpose and the
[52:41] bride very much fits that scripture amen
[52:43] we love him and we're called according
[52:45] to his purpose which is we're going to
[52:46] go on a rapture that's his purpose in
[52:48] this hour hallelujah i mean so so when
[52:51] our hearts get overwhelmed we can be led
[52:54] we say lord lead me i mean bring that
[52:57] revelation back to me i mean where it's
[52:59] not my five senses governing my
[53:01] decisions and and and and how i'm
[53:03] conducting myself but maybe who i am and
[53:05] you lord bring it back to my remembrance
[53:08] oh god show me who i am in you once
[53:10] again i mean that when that you know so
[53:12] when our hearts get overwhelmed we can
[53:14] be led to a place
[53:16] hallelujah a place of stability a place
[53:19] of a firm foundation amen that that that
[53:22] our hearts don't overwhelm us no more
[53:24] but we come to a place of rest even in
[53:26] the storm who's following me today
[53:29] aren't you glad you have that rock amen
[53:31] here's our rock our god is our rock of
[53:33] revelation
[53:34] hallelujah praise the lord now brother
[53:37] brown would say this in in the spiritual
[53:39] adoption message
[53:41] now he's talking about going back to
[53:42] matthew 16 there where where jesus is
[53:46] speaking
[53:47] to to his disciples there he says upon
[53:49] this rock i'll build my church now and i
[53:51] say unto thee thou art peter now we know
[53:53] peter means little rock i am the great
[53:55] rock i am the cornerstone there's jesus
[53:58] speaking but you are the little rock
[54:00] that's placed upon me the builders chose
[54:02] you now this should give us a real a
[54:05] real good uh peace in this time i mean
[54:07] the builders chose you
[54:09] you never chose yourself
[54:12] i mean the builders chose you the angel
[54:14] of god one night working in the quarry
[54:17] called you out and you submitted
[54:19] yourself to me this is talking about us
[54:21] amen we never chose ourselves to be
[54:22] believers
[54:24] god chose us to be believers
[54:26] i mean because because the scripture
[54:27] says it's not that him that willeth or
[54:29] him that runeth but god that shows mercy
[54:32] it's god that calls i mean it's god that
[54:34] elects amen as god buys full knowledge
[54:36] looks down through time and sees us i
[54:39] mean as his children it is god that does
[54:41] the calling it's god that does the
[54:42] saving it's god that does the keeping
[54:45] i'm so glad it's that way amen amen so
[54:47] he says that the
[54:49] hallelujah the angel of god one night
[54:50] working in the quarry called you out i
[54:53] mean so we're all in this big you can
[54:54] say this big mountain of humanity
[54:57] but god in his wisdom came down and he
[55:00] saw you in that big mountain of humanity
[55:02] and cut you out by his word and chopped
[55:04] you and shaped you and because he wanted
[55:05] to take you from that mound and put you
[55:07] into a building hallelujah into the

[55:33] backward so it's a bashful some of us
[55:35] are not bashful god made us that way
[55:37] amen
[55:38] hallelujah remember this is not you know
[55:41] god god you know he said you know
[55:43] brother ram says that the bride is a
[55:45] bouquet of flowers
[55:47] a good bouquet has a lot of different
[55:49] kind of flowers big ones small ones
[55:51] bright ones not bright ones the greenery

[56:03] flowers it's like us we're all we're all

[56:08] of greenery on the bottom i don't mind i
[56:10] just want to be in the bouquet
[56:13] amen
[56:14] now
[56:16] see i made you the way that i wanted you
[56:19] to be
[56:20] i done the soaring you just stood still
[56:23] hallelujah
[56:24] and i've placed you now as a little
[56:26] stone to fit in with some other stone
[56:29] to lead that stone and this stone leads
[56:31] to that stone and that stone and the
[56:33] cement of love is bringing you together
[56:35] making the foundation which i am to be
[56:38] fitted together with every stone that
[56:40] professes my name and receives this
[56:43] revelation
[56:46] we know faith is a revelation
[56:49] revelation faith is a revelation it's
[56:51] it's revealed to you
[56:53] and it's one thing we should pray for
[56:55] more for anything especially at this
[56:57] time is for divine revelation yes
[57:00] right lord reveal to us remember i think
[57:03] i think this lockdown is is good because
[57:06] it's kind of maybe kind of pinched us a
[57:07] little bit to realize life is not just
[57:09] going to go on that's right you know
[57:11] there's a new normal there's another new
[57:13] normal then there's another new normal
[57:15] and things just keep changing but we
[57:17] don't want to be complacent in this hour
[57:19] we don't just want to float by we say
[57:21] lord
[57:22] open our eyes in a greater way reveal to
[57:25] us who we are on you and who you are
[57:27] make the world more alive to be lord
[57:28] make it more amen
[57:30] uh more wonderful hallelujah make it
[57:33] more living yeah
[57:34] no it is now it's a revelation
[57:37] for revelation is faith you cannot have
[57:40] a revelation without it being faith
[57:43] faith is a revelation because it's
[57:44] something that's revealed to you
[57:46] faith is a revelation faith is something
[57:48] that's been revealed to you like it was
[57:51] to abraham that could call anything
[57:53] contrary to that uh sorry to what has
[57:56] been revealed to him as though it wasn't
[57:59] so
[58:00] now faith that's what faith is is the
[58:02] revelation of god the church is built
[58:05] upon a revelation the whole entire
[58:08] body
[58:10] and he says this in spiritual adoption
[58:12] and upon this rock the revelation of god
[58:14] that'll stand still and be cut the stone
[58:17] by the revelation i'll build my church
[58:19] and all the gates of hell shall not
[58:21] prevail against it showing that surely
[58:23] all the gates of hell would be against
[58:25] it but it shall never prevail
[58:29] amen he says this
[58:32] and may i take this moment to say this
[58:34] my friend that the entire church the
[58:36] living god is built solemnly upon the
[58:38] spiritual revelation of the lord jesus
[58:40] christ no matter how educated you are
[58:43] how smart you are how well you may think
[58:45] you know the bible satan knows it just a
[58:47] lot better than you do but only through
[58:49] the revelation
[58:51] god
[58:52] god through the holy spirit your tutor
[58:54] revealed it to you that he saved you by
[58:57] his grace
[58:59] amen so it's only through revelation now
[59:01] you say well then therefore i'm just
[59:03] going to sit back and god will pour it
[59:05] in when he wants to and no no him that
[59:07] seeketh findeth him that knocketh it
[59:09] shall be opened right you got to believe
[59:11] that he is and he's a rewarder of them
[59:13] that diligently seek him
[59:14] hallelujah so you know if we realize
[59:16] it's god that reveals it to us we say
[59:18] lord reveal it to me here i am oh god
[59:21] open open my heart lord jesus may may
[59:23] the world not come in and choke out the
[59:25] effect effectiveness of your word in my
[59:27] life
[59:29] amen
[59:30] amen amen he would say as well in the
[59:33] church age book as i've already said
[59:35] this book revelation is the consummation
[59:37] of the scriptures it is even placed
[59:39] exactly right in the canon of scripture
[59:42] at the end
[59:43] now
[59:44] you can know that uh no why it says that
[59:47] anyone who reads or even hears it is
[59:49] blessed it is the revelation of god
[59:52] that will give you authority over the
[59:54] devil and you can see why
[59:57] they who would add or take from it
[59:59] should i would be cursed it would have
[1:00:02] to be so
[1:00:03] for who can add or take away from the
[1:00:05] perfect revelation of god and overcome
[1:00:06] the enemy it is that symbol there is
[1:00:08] nothing as such prevailing power
[1:00:11] as the revelation of the word now i want
[1:00:14] you to just go back in your mind to
[1:00:17] matthew 16 jesus says and upon this rock
[1:00:20] i'll build my church so therefore that
[1:00:22] means there is other rocks right but
[1:00:24] there's a particular rock of the
[1:00:26] revelation of who jesus christ is that
[1:00:28] rock is the church
[1:00:30] is the rock that the church is built
[1:00:31] upon the revelation of who he is now
[1:00:34] jesus would give the parable of the wise
[1:00:36] and the foolish man
[1:00:38] the the foolish man built his house upon
[1:00:40] sand now i remember from brother isaac
[1:00:43] preached that um message on sand a few
[1:00:46] years ago that sand is actually just
[1:00:48] rock that's been crushed down to powder
[1:00:51] right if you if you reverse the process
[1:00:53] you have a whole rock but if you crush
[1:00:55] it down it's it's it's a whole bunch of
[1:00:57] small rocks that's just now what we call
[1:01:00] sand so now he said the foolish man
[1:01:02] built his house upon the sand now we
[1:01:04] know that sand is man's reasoning
[1:01:07] right it's just shifting sands it just
[1:01:09] moves with moves with the wind you know
[1:01:11] it's you know that you know it has no
[1:01:13] firm firm foundation i mean when storms
[1:01:15] come
[1:01:16] um jesus said that when the storms came
[1:01:18] the house was built upon the sand fell
[1:01:21] down and great was the loss of the house
[1:01:23] but he said a wise man
[1:01:25] digs down until he hits rock
[1:01:27] i mean so he's not just willing to walk
[1:01:29] with god i mean because it's a nice idea
[1:01:32] and someone else told them that or you
[1:01:34] know you know this is what everyone else
[1:01:36] is doing and these are nice people it
[1:01:38] goes beyond that but they
[1:01:40] you know a real believer will dig down
[1:01:42] through through the sand oh this is an
[1:01:44] idea and well i'm a good person i've
[1:01:46] done nothing wrong therefore the lord's
[1:01:48] got to accept me and look at you know my
[1:01:50] upbringing and different things you know
[1:01:51] that's all man's reasoning there's
[1:01:53] nothing we can give to god to earn
[1:01:55] salvation amen
[1:01:57] i mean there's nothing jesus paid it all
[1:01:59] that day on calvary i mean it's a very
[1:02:01] important revelation to have that the
[1:02:03] blood has cleansed us from all sin amen
[1:02:06] that we are free we've been loosed amen
[1:02:08] from sin by the power of the blood amen
[1:02:09] hallelujah and then so now so the wise
[1:02:12] man digs down through all religious
[1:02:14] reasoning until he hits the revelation
[1:02:16] of god's word and then he just pushes
[1:02:19] that out and he builds his house there
[1:02:21] yes and then the lord says that those
[1:02:24] storms may come and go that house is
[1:02:26] gonna stand amen amen so now storms are
[1:02:30] gonna come right there's gonna be winds
[1:02:33] there's going to be storms there's going
[1:02:34] to be rain there's going to be typhoons
[1:02:36] monsoons hurricanes however you want to
[1:02:38] stay at cyclones and you know all those
[1:02:40] things happening but you know so there's
[1:02:42] going to be good points in life and bad
[1:02:44] points in life hard points in life but
[1:02:46] but a house that's built upon the rock
[1:02:48] of revelation of who jesus christ is
[1:02:50] it's going to stand
[1:02:52] you can see it in david's life when he's
[1:02:53] there at ziglag and the amalekites have
[1:02:56] come in and taken all his family away
[1:02:58] and taken his men's family away and even
[1:03:00] as men got to the point where they were
[1:03:02] consenting to stone david but says but
[1:03:05] david encouraged himself in the lord why
[1:03:08] because he had a rock that his life was
[1:03:09] built upon the revelation of who you
[1:03:11] know jesus christ was or god was to him
[1:03:13] in that day hallelujah but if his if his
[1:03:17] life was built upon shifting sands of
[1:03:19] just reasoning
[1:03:21] well i could be a good king
[1:03:23] i could do it better than saul look i'm
[1:03:25] from bethlehem i'm from a noble house
[1:03:26] here you know uh everyone likes me you
[1:03:29] know i've got an influence over the
[1:03:30] people and you know we can you know i
[1:03:32] can sing better than saul i can create
[1:03:35] music and i can you know i can minister
[1:03:37] this kind of way and you know but if
[1:03:39] it's all reasoning if it was only
[1:03:41] reasoning in david's life
[1:03:43] then he would have fallen apart at
[1:03:45] ziggler true but because his life was
[1:03:47] built upon the divine revelation i'm
[1:03:49] going to the throne no matter what comes
[1:03:52] amen he could stand there and he could
[1:03:54] go to the rock
[1:03:56] because he encouraged himself in the
[1:03:57] lord his god amen and we know the rest
[1:04:00] of the story don't we god gave him
[1:04:01] instructions go pursue and you'll
[1:04:02] recover all amen hallelujah and they did
[1:04:06] it i'm so glad for that
[1:04:08] yes amen so there's nothing such as
[1:04:10] prevailing power as a revelation of the
[1:04:13] world why because it's the gates
[1:04:15] amen i mean sorry it's the rock that the
[1:04:18] church is built upon
[1:04:21] now
[1:04:22] if we go to second samuel i'm just gonna
[1:04:24] i'm just gonna keep reading from david
[1:04:26] here second samuel 22 and
[1:04:28] 29 for thou art my lamp oh lord
[1:04:31] and the lord will lighten my darkness
[1:04:34] for by thee i have run through a troop
[1:04:36] by my god have i leaped over a wall as
[1:04:39] for god he his way is perfect the word
[1:04:42] of the lord is tried he is a buckler to
[1:04:45] all them that trust in him for who is
[1:04:47] god save the lord and who is a rock save
[1:04:50] our god
[1:04:51] god is my strength and power he maketh
[1:04:54] my way perfect he maketh my feet like
[1:04:56] hein's feet and sitteth me upon my high
[1:04:59] places he teacheth my hands to war so
[1:05:01] that above steel shall be broken in my
[1:05:04] arms thou hast also given me the shield
[1:05:06] of my salvation and thy
[1:05:09] gentleness hath made
[1:05:11] me great
[1:05:12] and then in verse 47 and
[1:05:14] the lord liveth and blessed be my rock
[1:05:17] and exalted be the god of the rock of my
[1:05:20] salvation it is god that avengeth me
[1:05:22] that bringeth down the people under me
[1:05:24] and that bringeth me
[1:05:26] forth from my enemies thou also
[1:05:29] has lifted me up on high above them that
[1:05:32] rose up against me thou has delivered me
[1:05:34] from the violent man therefore i give
[1:05:36] thanks unto thee o lord among the
[1:05:38] heathen will i sing praises unto thy
[1:05:40] name he is the tower of salvation for
[1:05:43] his king
[1:05:44] enjoys mercy to his anointed unto david
[1:05:47] and to his seed
[1:05:49] more then psalms 62 1 a psalm of david
[1:05:53] truly my soul waited upon god for he
[1:05:55] cometh
[1:05:56] from him cometh my salvation
[1:05:59] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:06:01] is my defense i shall not greatly
[1:06:04] be moved how long will he imagine
[1:06:06] mischief against a man you shall be
[1:06:09] slain you shall be sorry ye shall be
[1:06:12] slain all of you
[1:06:14] as a bowing wall shall you be in as a
[1:06:17] totaling fence thou they only consult to
[1:06:20] cast him down from his excellency they
[1:06:22] delight in lies they bless from their
[1:06:24] mouth but they curse inwardly selah my
[1:06:27] soul
[1:06:28] wait thou only upon god for my
[1:06:31] expectation is from him
[1:06:33] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:06:35] is my defense i shall not be moved and
[1:06:38] god is my salvation and my glory the
[1:06:41] rock of my strength my refuge isn't god
[1:06:44] trust in him at all times ye people pour
[1:06:47] out your heart before him god is a
[1:06:49] refuge for us
[1:06:50] sealer i mean so i mean so and god is my
[1:06:54] salvation and my glory the rock of my
[1:06:56] strength is the revelation of my
[1:06:58] strength
[1:06:59] and my refuge is in god
[1:07:01] hallelujah see david knew that god was
[1:07:04] his rock
[1:07:06] amen east brother brown says in the
[1:07:08] message shalom now if you noticed in the
[1:07:10] scripture reading here in psalms it kept
[1:07:13] saying god is my rock do you know that a
[1:07:15] rock represents in the bible what it
[1:07:17] represents a rock in the bible
[1:07:18] represents the revelation of god see god
[1:07:22] is my revelation he is see the entire
[1:07:24] the revelation of the word is the rock
[1:07:28] he says i like the way david speaks that
[1:07:30] the rock you notice so many times god is
[1:07:33] my rock you know what a rock is referred
[1:07:35] to in the bible a rock is a revelation
[1:07:38] like peter said thou art the christ the
[1:07:39] son of the living god he said blessed
[1:07:41] are thou simon son of jonas and upon
[1:07:43] this rock this revelation god revealed
[1:07:46] it to me flesh and blood never revealed
[1:07:47] this but my father which is in heaven
[1:07:50] upon this rock this revelation i'll
[1:07:52] build my church and david here crying
[1:07:54] out god is my rock my revelation
[1:07:58] hallelujah now
[1:08:00] it's very important now
[1:08:02] as i was saying in the beginning
[1:08:04] when when israel was at mizpah
[1:08:07] there and god fought their battle
[1:08:09] discomforted the philistines he had
[1:08:12] already done that before
[1:08:13] and god was already one who fought the
[1:08:16] people's battles right he was always he
[1:08:18] was already that way but it had to be
[1:08:21] revealed to them
[1:08:23] they had to yeah they it had to be made
[1:08:25] known to them that god could fight their
[1:08:27] battles and he still did
[1:08:29] because god doesn't change there's got
[1:08:31] to be the same thing with you and i the
[1:08:33] lord i trust will drop into our hearts
[1:08:35] god fights our battle i mean he's
[1:08:37] already defeated the devil that down
[1:08:40] calvary satan doesn't have the own keys
[1:08:43] to his own house right he's a completely
[1:08:46] defeated being he's nothing but a bluff
[1:08:48] but may it be lord reveal that to us
[1:08:51] amen that we know in our hearts the
[1:08:53] devil's defeated right that we know in
[1:08:55] our hearts that victory is certain
[1:08:57] because if we realize or if we have the
[1:08:59] revelation that victory is certain
[1:09:01] hallelujah we're going to press the
[1:09:02] battle and then we're not going to
[1:09:04] wonder does the word work we know it
[1:09:06] works yes sir amen we know god is
[1:09:08] victorious amen brother braham said in
[1:09:10] spiritual adoption he says if he will
[1:09:13] reveal to you this morning
[1:09:15] by the revelation that this is the end
[1:09:18] of your suffering this is the end of
[1:09:21] your sickness
[1:09:22] all devils out of torment will never
[1:09:24] shake that foundation
[1:09:26] though every doctor says it's wrong for
[1:09:28] upon this rock i'll build my church the
[1:09:30] gates of hell cannot prevail against it
[1:09:33] though it would be against it yet it
[1:09:35] cannot prevail for when the enemy comes
[1:09:37] unlike a flood the spirit of god will
[1:09:39] raise a standard against it every time
[1:09:40] you see it you get it now jesus being
[1:09:43] revealed to his disciples so if we could
[1:09:45] just reveal you know if the lord could
[1:09:47] just reveal to us by revelation this is
[1:09:50] the season
[1:09:51] of the end of our suffering right this
[1:09:53] is the end of the season of unbelief
[1:09:55] spirits that fight against us amen
[1:09:58] unbelief that comes against this worry
[1:09:59] and strife that now is the season
[1:10:02] addiction whether it's drugs or alcohol
[1:10:04] whatever it may be amen could be that it
[1:10:07] could be anything anything that hinders
[1:10:08] your walk bound you down this is the
[1:10:11] time amen god is here to reveal to us
[1:10:13] that this is the end of our suffering
[1:10:15] where the lord has come i mean to give
[1:10:17] us a full restoration a full deliverance
[1:10:20] amen from our past from our flesh from
[1:10:23] from spirits to maybe travel down the
[1:10:25] family line wherever it may be this if
[1:10:28] if the lord could just reveal to us this
[1:10:30] is the season of the end of all of our
[1:10:32] sufferings not just physical sickness i
[1:10:35] mean but spiritual things that bother us
[1:10:37] amen but now god is present i mean to
[1:10:40] deliver us you know we don't have to
[1:10:41] stay bound amen well you know things
[1:10:43] fight against us but if if the law could
[1:10:45] just drop into our hearts actually no no
[1:10:48] the lord's taking care of it all he's
[1:10:50] already defeated that devil that down
[1:10:52] calvary and god proved himself in this
[1:10:55] this hour that we live i mean he proved
[1:10:57] to us that he has defeated everything
[1:10:59] and there's nothing that can be named
[1:11:01] that our lord has not defeated amen he
[1:11:03] defeated cancer he defeated all seconds
[1:11:06] i mean i love it where where lazarus was
[1:11:08] four days in the grave you know i think
[1:11:10] of people can have uh you know permanent
[1:11:13] effects
[1:11:14] you know from sickness you know i was
[1:11:16] thinking about little abigail you know
[1:11:17] how they're saying you know because that
[1:11:19] autoimmune disease that you know um you
[1:11:21] know was fighting her brain and you know
[1:11:24] and and and the doctors were saying well
[1:11:26] you know you can you know um you know
[1:11:29] they were telling susannah and emerson
[1:11:30] you know she may never become normal
[1:11:32] again
[1:11:33] but i was thinking when all this was
[1:11:35] going on you know lazarus was brain was
[1:11:38] bit was what was already rotten he was
[1:11:40] four days in the grave this is how bad
[1:11:42] that condition was you know his brain
[1:11:44] was four days rotten in the grave the
[1:11:46] noses sunken eyes had gone and yeah the
[1:11:48] body was already decaying but the
[1:11:50] resurrection in the life stood to his
[1:11:52] tomb and called him by name and we know
[1:11:54] that if jesus did not call lazarus by
[1:11:56] name there would have been a general
[1:11:58] resurrection anybody said lazarus come
[1:12:00] forth and a man whose body was rotten
[1:12:02] four days in the grave came out healthy
[1:12:05] normal and well he had no side effects
[1:12:08] he didn't have any lingering effects of
[1:12:09] being dead in his body rotten his mental
[1:12:12] faculties were fully restored his immune
[1:12:14] system fully restored his body fully all
[1:12:16] the organs everything he could see he
[1:12:17] could hear he could speak he could
[1:12:19] reason now fully restored hallelujah so
[1:12:21] if if god can do that if our lord jesus
[1:12:24] can do that for a man who is dead in the
[1:12:26] grave four days how much more a person
[1:12:28] who's alive almighty that maybe just
[1:12:30] being in the hospital or the other thing
[1:12:32] about abigail they say your brain is you
[1:12:34] know might never recover but you know
[1:12:36] they're expecting a full recovery now
[1:12:37] amen this is the doctors we always
[1:12:39] believed in a full recovery
[1:12:40] dropped into brother emerson's heart
[1:12:42] early in the trial he says they'll you
[1:12:43] know we're going to smite this thing
[1:12:45] with the arab guys deliver until it's
[1:12:46] totally destroyed
[1:12:49] so you know and now of course abby's
[1:12:50] home and well and
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:53] so we praise the lord for that but you
[1:12:55] know you think about there's no
[1:12:56] situation in life amen where well in my
[1:12:59] opinion that is too far nothing is too
[1:13:01] hard for the lord nothing is too hard
[1:13:03] there's nothing too impossible he
[1:13:05] doesn't have a hard basket he doesn't
[1:13:07] procrastinate because something's too
[1:13:08] difficult to do there's nothing too
[1:13:10] difficult to the lord and if god could
[1:13:12] just drop it in our hearts that he's
[1:13:13] already provided i mean deliverance and
[1:13:16] healing and salvation not just for
[1:13:18] ourselves but for our family i mean he's
[1:13:20] already released through the power of
[1:13:21] his word all power to deliver sickness
[1:13:23] and heal and cast out devils you know
[1:13:26] you know in the church of the living god
[1:13:27] this morning is is the power to heal all
[1:13:31] the sick to raise the dead aiming to
[1:13:33] cast out the devil aiming to bring peace
[1:13:36] aiming to cast out anxiety and worry and
[1:13:39] unbelief and troubling spirits and
[1:13:41] addiction in the church the living god
[1:13:43] right now lays that power yes hallelujah
[1:13:46] if god is in you amen that power is in
[1:13:49] you
[1:13:50] right let's just not just have it in
[1:13:51] some kind of abstract way of the church
[1:13:54] you got to say no it's in me and me amen
[1:13:56] that same one that conquered hell there
[1:13:58] in the grave and conquered all things is
[1:14:00] now living in me
[1:14:01] hallelujah
[1:14:03] so i pray this morning if god could just
[1:14:04] reveal to us amen that he has already
[1:14:08] conquered all sickness and this is the
[1:14:11] season of the end of our suffering amen
[1:14:15] amen david would say
[1:14:17] uh this is in um this is in psalms 119
[1:14:21] verse 18.
[1:14:22] he says open thou mine eyes
[1:14:25] that i may behold wondrous things out of
[1:14:28] thy law
[1:14:30] so david's praying now this is david is
[1:14:32] a man after god's own heart we know
[1:14:34] and david is asking lord open my eyes
[1:14:37] and and and that word open actually
[1:14:39] means to actually take off a covering
[1:14:41] unveil my eyes lord
[1:14:43] that i may behold wondrous things out of
[1:14:45] thy law so it's not like david couldn't
[1:14:47] read the law you know he had the first
[1:14:50] you know he had the law of moses but
[1:14:52] david's looking lord
[1:14:54] revealed the wondrous things out of the
[1:14:56] lord reveal the supernatural things
[1:14:58] reveal the mysterious things reveal the
[1:15:00] high things
[1:15:01] lord jesus this was this is his cry and
[1:15:03] it should be the same cry for us lord
[1:15:06] amen open my eyes lord that this open
[1:15:09] book that we have received this word
[1:15:10] that's come open in this hour lord
[1:15:12] reveal the wondrous things out of it
[1:15:15] hallelujah reveal i mean reveal who i
[1:15:17] really am amen that because remember
[1:15:19] we're living in a day that we would know
[1:15:22] as we are knowing hallelujah this is the
[1:15:24] other that we would know
[1:15:26] so so we would know
[1:15:27] as god knows us so as god thinks of us
[1:15:30] we would think about ourselves the same
[1:15:31] way yeah i mean so if he knows us as his
[1:15:34] beloved hallelujah then that revelation
[1:15:37] will come into our hearts i am my i my
[1:15:40] beloved's beloved amen hallelujah
[1:15:43] you know if he looks at us as sinless
[1:15:45] virtuous the bride of jesus christ made
[1:15:47] in his image the image of the word amen
[1:15:50] the god god made flesh and a people i
[1:15:52] mean overcoming i mean made to
[1:15:56] you know
[1:15:57] made to sinners throne as he sat down
[1:15:59] overcame and sat down at his father's
[1:16:00] throne amen if you know
[1:16:02] if that's how we are known
[1:16:05] then lord jesus may we know as we are
[1:16:06] known amen hallelujah because many
[1:16:09] people you know they they they wrestle
[1:16:11] with the fact does god love me
[1:16:14] and
[1:16:15] you know or or when i get to the other
[1:16:17] side
[1:16:18] is he going to be pleased with me
[1:16:20] well i just want to say this you know
[1:16:22] god is looking god is looking for people
[1:16:24] who will receive him
[1:16:26] amen this is what god's looking for
[1:16:28] and
[1:16:30] many times we you know we don't want to
[1:16:32] beat ourselves up on what we think is
[1:16:34] our performance i think if we you know
[1:16:36] serve the lord let serve the lord with
[1:16:37] our whole hearts amen right but he's
[1:16:39] looking for people that will receive him
[1:16:42] hallelujah and so now if we have
[1:16:44] received and you think about why is he
[1:16:46] why is he quickened us in this hour why
[1:16:48] has he made us alive in him
[1:16:50] have you ever thought about you know
[1:16:51] there's a purpose
[1:16:52] every season or every yeah every season
[1:16:56] there's a people that god has sent to
[1:16:58] the earth to fulfill the promised word
[1:17:00] of that hour
[1:17:01] right so moses was there to fulfill the
[1:17:03] deliverance out of egypt joshua is there
[1:17:06] after moses aiming to bring the people
[1:17:07] into the promised land samuel was there
[1:17:09] to anoint saul and then david to be king
[1:17:12] david was there to become king over
[1:17:14] israel to have solomon solomon was there
[1:17:16] to build the temple now it's very easy
[1:17:17] to look back
[1:17:19] and say yes these ones were there and
[1:17:21] they fulfilled god's word nehemiah and
[1:17:23] ezra were there to rebuild jerusalem and
[1:17:25] the temple you know you know john the
[1:17:27] baptist was there to forerun the lord
[1:17:29] jesus christ the lord was there to
[1:17:31] redeem all of humanity as god and flesh
[1:17:33] the apostles were there and mean to to
[1:17:36] to take the gospel into into all nations
[1:17:38] right you know we know these things you
[1:17:41] know looking backwards and say well of
[1:17:43] course the apostle paul ran his race and
[1:17:45] you know he you know you know he did
[1:17:47] that which was pleasing to god he had
[1:17:48] that crown of life look at all the
[1:17:50] things he did
[1:17:51] but you know he fulfilled his portion
[1:17:55] yeah and i believe if we're fully
[1:17:56] surrendered to god we will fulfill our
[1:18:00] portion amen and what is god looking for
[1:18:02] he's looking for people that love him
[1:18:04] that serve him they give their whole
[1:18:05] life to him that everything that that
[1:18:08] his choices amen are their choices that
[1:18:11] their choices aren't theirs but their
[1:18:13] choices are his choices lord what would
[1:18:15] you have me do in this hour is this
[1:18:16] pleasing to you you know it's not so
[1:18:19] it's not based on our merit of of what
[1:18:22] we've done for him it's those that can
[1:18:24] receive him look at the woman at the
[1:18:25] well
[1:18:27] she was lost and undone she wasn't even
[1:18:29] welcome in her society she had to come
[1:18:30] to the well at a time when the other
[1:18:32] woman didn't come to the well but she
[1:18:34] had something in her brother brown says
[1:18:35] she had representation in heaven
[1:18:38] and the very reason she had
[1:18:39] representation in heaven was the fact
[1:18:41] that when the messiah came and jesus
[1:18:44] began to discern her life and say go get
[1:18:46] your husband she says i have none and
[1:18:48] you know he says you've spoke you know
[1:18:50] you've told me the truth you've had
[1:18:52] you've had five and the one you're with
[1:18:53] us not yours you know she said you know
[1:18:55] we know we know where messiah comes he
[1:18:58] will do all these things and she just
[1:19:00] did i mean he just said to her
[1:19:02] i am the messiah he that speaks to thee
[1:19:04] am he
[1:19:05] now she didn't have to sit down for a
[1:19:07] big five hour discussion of how that
[1:19:10] works she just believed it hey man he
[1:19:12] dropped her water pot she ran into the
[1:19:13] sea the brother graham says the reason
[1:19:15] that she could do that is because she
[1:19:17] had representation in heaven yeah i mean
[1:19:19] the scrubs and pharisees they they heard
[1:19:22] the same kind of words they saw jesus do
[1:19:24] the same kind of things but they called
[1:19:26] him beelzebub they rejected him because
[1:19:28] they had no representation in heaven so
[1:19:31] the very reason that we receive well the
[1:19:33] very fact that we receive the word shows
[1:19:35] us i trust it does i mean it's
[1:19:37] transformed our life shows us that we
[1:19:39] have representation in heaven now what
[1:19:41] is that representation in heaven that is
[1:19:43] our theophany our eternal body waiting
[1:19:46] for us up in glory when the apostle paul
[1:19:49] would say you know the if this earthly
[1:19:51] tabernacle be dissolved i have one
[1:19:53] waiting in heaven already eternal in the
[1:19:55] heavens amen so now god you think about
[1:19:58] it
[1:19:59] if i have representation in heaven god
[1:20:02] can't change that representation amen
[1:20:04] right he can't take my theophany because
[1:20:06] what i've done here on this earth and
[1:20:08] you know i've disappointed him whatever
[1:20:09] more take that theophany make it nothing
[1:20:11] and then i'm not going to get there no
[1:20:13] he already made up his mind he has so
[1:20:15] many wedding garments that he's going to
[1:20:17] dress people in if i can put it that way
[1:20:19] right he has every place at the wedding
[1:20:21] supper feast and then he knows he's
[1:20:23] going to sit at the table and the reason
[1:20:26] that we've responded to him in this hour
[1:20:28] and we've given our lives and he's
[1:20:30] transformed us as proof as evidence that
[1:20:33] we have a place in that wedding's upper
[1:20:34] table
[1:20:36] that we have representation in heaven
[1:20:39] amen if his holy ghost has come into
[1:20:40] your life change your nature the things
[1:20:42] you once did you don't do no more you
[1:20:44] become a new creature in christ the
[1:20:46] things you love you used to love you
[1:20:48] can't stomach anymore you hate them you
[1:20:50] can't do them and the things you would
[1:20:52] never used to do now you do and you love
[1:20:54] amen what's happened and and and who did
[1:20:57] it god did it yes
[1:20:58] it wasn't you that did it and there's
[1:21:00] god that did it many people try and do
[1:21:02] it but that's just being but that's just
[1:21:04] their life being built on sands of man's
[1:21:06] ideas though they may be good ideas but
[1:21:08] those who we're god has really come and
[1:21:10] transformed their life and made them
[1:21:11] where they begin to read the scripture
[1:21:13] and they begin to see actually my life
[1:21:15] is a fulfillment of that scripture i
[1:21:17] mean i can turn the other cheek i can
[1:21:19] let go of past hurts you know i can't
[1:21:21] forgive i mean i can't pray for those
[1:21:23] who despitefully use me i can't love the
[1:21:25] unlovable hallelujah you know i can't
[1:21:27] turn the other cheek i can forgive i
[1:21:29] mean i can intercede i can accept a
[1:21:31] genuine love for lost and dying world
[1:21:33] hallelujah you know those kind of people
[1:21:36] god has transformed their lives amen and
[1:21:37] god's actually changed them and what
[1:21:39] does that show you have representation
[1:21:42] in heaven amen and god can't give that
[1:21:45] representation
[1:21:46] hallelujah that's a good rock to be
[1:21:48] built upon amen amen when this world was
[1:21:51] falling apart you say no no i'm built
[1:21:53] i'm in my god is my rock he's my
[1:21:55] revelation
[1:21:56] hallelujah
[1:21:58] praise our god
[1:22:00] has he done a work in your life hey
[1:22:02] hallelujah and if he's done started to
[1:22:04] work hey i'd start confessing it yes sir
[1:22:07] amen member because he's the high priest
[1:22:08] of our profession
[1:22:10] hallelujah he can only work that means
[1:22:12] he can only work as we profess his word
[1:22:14] yes lord right
[1:22:16] hallelujah if you professor you're
[1:22:19] backslidden you'll be backslidden
[1:22:21] right if you profess i'm an overcomer
[1:22:23] and god's going to see me through this
[1:22:24] you're going to overcome
[1:22:27] hallelujah if you profess that the blood
[1:22:29] has cleansed you amen the reality of it
[1:22:31] will come into your life yes sir
[1:22:34] hallelujah
[1:22:35] isn't that right yes it's right praise
[1:22:37] our god i'm beginning to feel religious
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:42] hallelujah so it's the so he said now
[1:22:45] um open david again he says open thou
[1:22:48] mine eyes that i may behold the wondrous
[1:22:51] things out of thy law
[1:22:54] so he's saying so those things that
[1:22:55] david wanted to behold they were already
[1:22:57] in the law but he was praying god would
[1:23:00] open them make them real to him
[1:23:02] right and it should be i trust the same
[1:23:04] thing with us because you know
[1:23:07] in this word is a body change amen
[1:23:11] and this word is salvation and this word
[1:23:13] is deliverous now if i had the message i
[1:23:15] just put it together because we know the
[1:23:16] message reveals christ in the scripture
[1:23:19] right it's not in another book and
[1:23:20] reveals jesus christ in here in here is
[1:23:23] the dead in christ coming out
[1:23:25] if it's revealed not just ink on paper
[1:23:27] now i'm talking about when it's divinely
[1:23:29] revealed into the believer's life
[1:23:31] hallelujah so it's like lord open my
[1:23:34] eyes that i'll see wondrous things in
[1:23:36] your word
[1:23:37] praise our god amen we have so many
[1:23:40] things you know brother and says we
[1:23:41] should be like prospectors
[1:23:43] amen we should be we should be looking
[1:23:45] down through the scripture for nuggets
[1:23:47] you know we should be prospecting and
[1:23:48] you know there's a lot of mines around
[1:23:50] the world i know i think in the
[1:23:51] johannesburg region that what's happened
[1:23:54] is as as they you know they do mining
[1:23:57] but then what happens is all the
[1:23:58] tailings and all the all the rock and
[1:24:00] stuff that they think there's no value
[1:24:01] of them and yes they make big heaps of
[1:24:04] it but then what happens is technology
[1:24:05] gets better then they go back through
[1:24:07] the tailings they go back through those
[1:24:09] which was just a rubbish dump and they
[1:24:11] remind that and they get all the
[1:24:12] precious things out so maybe some things
[1:24:15] you know you say well i've already mined
[1:24:17] through the scripture i've already mined
[1:24:18] through the message you know i've you
[1:24:19] know i've read it all i've seen it all
[1:24:21] i'll say no go back through what you
[1:24:24] call tailings yeah because what you call
[1:24:26] tailings there's there's gold in there
[1:24:28] oh yeah and then there's precious metals
[1:24:30] on there i can say there's rare earth
[1:24:32] metals in there i mean there's things of
[1:24:34] great value in there i mean we should
[1:24:36] dig back through because you'll find
[1:24:38] that the things that you just placed on
[1:24:39] the shelf or place to one side saying oh
[1:24:41] there's no value in that because of this
[1:24:43] you'll find i mean there's greater
[1:24:44] riches than you can even fathom amen
[1:24:47] hallelujah it'll make you spiritually a
[1:24:49] very rich man or woman if it's received
[1:24:52] in revelation
[1:24:54] now
[1:24:56] zechariah
[1:24:58] is um is
[1:25:00] speaking here in zechariah 4 1
[1:25:02] and the angel that talked with me came
[1:25:04] again and waked me
[1:25:06] as a man that is awakened out of his
[1:25:08] sleep
[1:25:09] and said unto me what see it thou
[1:25:13] i said i have looked and behold a
[1:25:14] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[1:25:17] the top of it and his
[1:25:19] and his seven lamps thereon
[1:25:21] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[1:25:24] are upon the top they're off and two
[1:25:26] olive trees by it one upon the right
[1:25:29] side of the bowl and the other on the
[1:25:30] left side thereof now you can keep
[1:25:32] reading down but we won't just to save
[1:25:34] time but heroes here is zechariah this
[1:25:37] is how the believer you know can be
[1:25:39] whereas asleep
[1:25:42] but yet there's all these things around
[1:25:44] us
[1:25:44] and the angel lord needs to come and
[1:25:46] wake us up out of the sleep to recognize
[1:25:49] what's already there
[1:25:51] you see many times it's not us you know
[1:25:53] we already have victory
[1:25:55] yeah we have total deliverance yes amen
[1:25:58] we have total victory but the lord needs
[1:26:01] to open our eyes
[1:26:04] to make us cause us to realize we have
[1:26:06] it yeah you follow me
[1:26:09] this is what we need is is for the lord
[1:26:12] and this is what we should pray for lord
[1:26:14] reveal to me
[1:26:16] who i am in you
[1:26:18] right reveal to me who i am and you
[1:26:21] that i will see where you've placed me
[1:26:24] because if you think about we are seated
[1:26:26] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:26:29] and that is a position of power and
[1:26:31] authority
[1:26:32] that by
[1:26:34] i say the new birth god quickening us he
[1:26:36] places us up in that position
[1:26:39] but many times i say lord help us that
[1:26:42] we would actually our eyes would come
[1:26:43] open that we would realize we're already
[1:26:46] seated in a place of power and authority
[1:26:49] over every devil over every sickness
[1:26:52] over every trend in society over
[1:26:54] everything that would sway us left and
[1:26:55] right and catch our attention and you
[1:26:57] know everything that would make us feel
[1:26:58] cold look warm and powerless we already
[1:27:01] have
[1:27:02] we're already in a position i mean to
[1:27:04] overcome all those things but lord open
[1:27:07] our eyes that we would see where we are
[1:27:10] remember zechariah was there but he was
[1:27:12] like in a dream but the angel lord had
[1:27:13] to come down
[1:27:14] and wake him up
[1:27:16] and then the then the angel began to ask
[1:27:18] him what do you see
[1:27:20] now i heard um brother wayne lawson he
[1:27:22] was preaching in um there in canada
[1:27:24] cloverdale camp it was tremendous i
[1:27:26] think i had it last weekend but he but
[1:27:28] he made a very um uh very astounding
[1:27:31] statement he said there's a big
[1:27:32] difference if i can get this right uh
[1:27:34] there's a big difference between looking
[1:27:36] for something
[1:27:38] and actually and actually finding it and
[1:27:40] seeing it for what it is
[1:27:42] see many people are looking for
[1:27:44] something
[1:27:45] they think there's some great big
[1:27:46] revival you know that's going to happen
[1:27:48] or you know oh there's the bride's
[1:27:50] revival and god's going to do incredible
[1:27:52] things and you know oh we you know we
[1:27:54] need something to come to make it happen
[1:27:56] that's looking for something but why you
[1:28:00] know but there's a big difference for
[1:28:01] looking for it to actually realizing
[1:28:03] it's already here and seeing it
[1:28:05] right we are living in a time you think
[1:28:07] about what god has done in the sound
[1:28:08] he's revealed himself in his fullness
[1:28:11] remember brother braham says that the
[1:28:12] opening of the seals reveals christ
[1:28:14] right the the seals have come off the
[1:28:16] book so now we're not wondering who we
[1:28:19] are anymore we know who we are we know
[1:28:21] who our god is we know what he's done i
[1:28:24] mean we've seen the full power of of of
[1:28:26] the blood being manifested in this hour
[1:28:28] hallelujah amen we know where we're
[1:28:30] going we know where we came from
[1:28:33] glory amen you know the lord has
[1:28:36] spiritually revealed this to us so but
[1:28:39] the thing is now if we're looking for
[1:28:41] something else you're gonna you know
[1:28:43] i'll go into this later maybe maybe
[1:28:44] another service but yeah i've been
[1:28:46] trying i've been i mean want to get into
[1:28:49] um
[1:28:50] where the former and the li
[1:28:52] formula and the latter rain run together
[1:28:53] in the end time and and we know you know
[1:28:56] i just want to say that's already
[1:28:57] happening
[1:28:58] amen because if we need someone else to
[1:29:01] come remember revelation
[1:29:03] is given the highest order that
[1:29:05] revelation is given through is through a
[1:29:06] vindicated prophet
[1:29:08] it's not through a bible school
[1:29:10] it's not through man's ideas it's a
[1:29:12] waste or a prophet amos 3 7 says the
[1:29:14] lord will do nothing until he reveals it
[1:29:16] to his servants the prophets and if you
[1:29:18] don't
[1:29:19] study through the study through the new
[1:29:22] testament you see that there are still
[1:29:23] prophets even into today
[1:29:25] and it says the days of the voice of the
[1:29:27] seventh angel the mystery of god shall
[1:29:29] be finished as he declares to his
[1:29:31] servants the prophets and we know we've
[1:29:32] already received that prophet to reveal
[1:29:34] the full word of god back to us again
[1:29:36] yes we're not looking for another one to
[1:29:39] come
[1:29:40] to open the book to us
[1:29:42] we've already had one come he's opened
[1:29:44] the book revealed jesus christ so now
[1:29:47] everything that has been promised to the
[1:29:49] bride is already here
[1:29:51] it's already here right rapturing faith
[1:29:54] is here quickening power is here
[1:29:56] amen the power to raise the dead from
[1:29:58] the grave is here
[1:30:00] the power to change these bodies is
[1:30:02] already within the believer
[1:30:04] amen overcoming power is here the
[1:30:06] bride's revival is here
[1:30:08] hallelujah those things are already here
[1:30:10] the former ladder rain running together
[1:30:12] to quicken the people i mean it's
[1:30:13] already here yes
[1:30:15] right now are you following me yes it's
[1:30:17] already here the thing is i say god and
[1:30:20] now i'm probably talking to myself more
[1:30:21] than anything god open my eyes amen
[1:30:25] that i would see
[1:30:27] in full clarity where we are right now
[1:30:29] amen because it's already here just like
[1:30:31] zechariah was asleep but all those
[1:30:33] things were around him but the angel had
[1:30:35] to come and awaken him up
[1:30:36] that he would see the candlesticks and
[1:30:38] different things going on i pray oh god
[1:30:40] may your great holy angel come may may
[1:30:43] the angel of your presence come to each
[1:30:44] one of us
[1:30:45] open our eyes
[1:30:47] mean that we would see where we are amen
[1:30:49] that you are our rock of revelation amen
[1:30:52] that that you have come to quicken us i
[1:30:54] mean that that these bodies would be
[1:30:56] changed amen all former latter reign are
[1:30:58] falling the bride's revival is going on
[1:31:00] amen that god is already here to pour
[1:31:03] himself out amen he yes he's in hosea
[1:31:06] sorry maybe i've been pondering it you
[1:31:07] know
[1:31:08] well i've been pondering off and on but
[1:31:09] he said hosea that he will come to you
[1:31:12] amen in that former ladder reigns just
[1:31:14] the lord himself coming to a people you
[1:31:16] know on the seventh seal
[1:31:18] brother braham says that yeah you know
[1:31:19] the seventh seal is actually christ
[1:31:21] himself yes yeah right it's actually
[1:31:23] christ himself the seventh seal now we
[1:31:25] know some people think that the seals
[1:31:27] are in a um what do you call it a um
[1:31:30] chronological order where it's the first
[1:31:32] and the second third and fourth and you
[1:31:33] know and and sure the first four that
[1:31:36] way but the others kind of overlapping
[1:31:37] different things but you know the
[1:31:39] seventh seal is christ himself
[1:31:41] where jesus himself showed the seven
[1:31:45] seals in in matthew chapter 24
[1:31:48] and he actually lays out the first one
[1:31:50] to six but for the seventh he says but
[1:31:52] when the son of man no man knoweth the
[1:31:54] hour when the son of man will come again
[1:31:56] and that's actually the seventh seal why
[1:31:58] see it's the lord coming down
[1:32:01] and as you know as that mighty angel
[1:32:03] with the open book i mean to make
[1:32:05] himself one with the bride of christ
[1:32:07] amen now brother and says about the
[1:32:08] seventh seal he says it's like a
[1:32:10] firecracker or firework going off you
[1:32:12] know a fight finger goes off and when a
[1:32:15] bit fires off and explodes and another
[1:32:17] bit fires off and it explodes another
[1:32:18] bit far up faster explodes he says it's
[1:32:21] the end of all things it's a cycle where
[1:32:23] the end of all things is happening
[1:32:25] so now what's going to happen first well
[1:32:28] you know
[1:32:29] um the church edge is going to end that
[1:32:31] that fires them you know cracker and
[1:32:33] blows off then yeah yeah then the next
[1:32:35] thing is the millennium sets in but
[1:32:37] that's a space of time and then
[1:32:38] eventually that's going to fire it's
[1:32:40] going to blow it's going to be done and
[1:32:42] there's going to be the white throne
[1:32:43] judgment different things and eternity's
[1:32:45] going to roll on so it's actually now
[1:32:46] we're living in a cycle of the end of
[1:32:49] suffering nature
[1:32:50] of the end of suffering humanity it's
[1:32:53] the end of sickness it's the end of
[1:32:55] sorrow and pain we're actually in a
[1:32:56] cycle
[1:32:57] where these things are going to come to
[1:32:59] an end it's an end of time right we're
[1:33:01] actually in that cycle who's
[1:33:03] who's with me just now right now
[1:33:05] hallelujah so now if that has already
[1:33:07] happened oh i mean you'd say rather if
[1:33:09] that is in progress of happening then
[1:33:11] the first thing that needs to happen is
[1:33:14] actually it anchors into our hearts the
[1:33:16] revelation amen that now is the end of
[1:33:20] our suffering
[1:33:21] we don't have to be we don't have to
[1:33:23] serve the devil no more
[1:33:25] i mean we don't have to be under his
[1:33:26] bondage no more we don't have to put up
[1:33:29] with family spirits or you know cultural
[1:33:31] spirits or unbelief or pain or hurt or
[1:33:34] our past or we don't those things aren't
[1:33:36] meant to rule us we're meant for them
[1:33:38] right those things are meant to be under
[1:33:40] our feet than every devil in hell
[1:33:42] amen it's not meant to rule us but we
[1:33:45] meant to put it under our feet
[1:33:47] now is the season of the end of the
[1:33:49] cycle of of humanity living under the
[1:33:54] curse of the devil all right hallelujah
[1:33:56] but what it does is as as one cycle ends
[1:34:00] another one begins
[1:34:02] right so now if we can take when it
[1:34:04] comes to time as time comes to an end
[1:34:07] eternity begins to roll along
[1:34:09] so it's a cycle where time begins to end
[1:34:12] but eternity now is actually overlapping
[1:34:14] with time and then now eternity is going
[1:34:16] to roll on and time ends
[1:34:20] now we're living in a time where we're
[1:34:23] the cycle of pain or even revival and
[1:34:25] death
[1:34:26] you know these things that hold us down
[1:34:29] now is the season where it's coming to
[1:34:31] an end but i pray and and i'm just gonna
[1:34:35] i'm gonna wrap it up with this but i
[1:34:37] pray that the lord would reveal to us
[1:34:41] that all those things have been defeated
[1:34:44] hallelujah defeated sickness has been
[1:34:47] defeated complexes have been defeated
[1:34:50] hallelujah spirits that hang around and
[1:34:52] trouble us we don't have to put up with
[1:34:54] them anymore
[1:34:56] hallelujah we don't have to put up with
[1:34:57] those things the lord has come
[1:35:00] not physically but you know his word is
[1:35:03] here amen to break every cycle
[1:35:06] generational problems they've come to an
[1:35:09] end
[1:35:10] you don't have to put up with them
[1:35:11] anymore you know there was a season
[1:35:13] where israel had to put up with being
[1:35:14] beaten in egypt
[1:35:16] there was a season they ruined they
[1:35:17] couldn't help it they were stuck in this
[1:35:19] way but then god came down
[1:35:21] hallelujah and they were liberated by
[1:35:24] the power of god
[1:35:26] and now they they didn't have to be
[1:35:28] beaten by slave masters anymore but they
[1:35:30] were free from them they were living in
[1:35:31] a different season
[1:35:32] hallelujah they were the same people but
[1:35:34] they're in a different season
[1:35:36] you know there were seasons where israel
[1:35:38] was like the philistines would afflict
[1:35:40] them or the or the midianites of
[1:35:42] different ones but then the season
[1:35:43] changed where they they didn't have to
[1:35:45] be under the bondage of those people no
[1:35:47] more but they were now free in their own
[1:35:48] land
[1:35:50] and it's the same thing with you and i
[1:35:51] israel many times if you read through
[1:35:53] the book of judges in different places
[1:35:55] they were in their land
[1:35:58] they were living in the promise but they
[1:36:00] weren't living according to the promise
[1:36:02] they were they reflected by the
[1:36:03] midianites or the philistines of
[1:36:05] different ones but they called upon god
[1:36:07] and god broke that season that they
[1:36:09] didn't have to be slave ma
[1:36:11] yo yo in in slavery no more amen
[1:36:15] hallelujah

[1:36:20] to give a full liberation yes and we
[1:36:22] don't

[1:36:35] lives are built upon divine revelation

[1:36:39] present condition
[1:36:41] and the things that you're wrestling

[1:36:50] here's our rock of revelation and if we
[1:36:53] can just look at those things
[1:36:56] instead of looking at you know
[1:36:58] trouble in here
[1:36:59] things that bother us
[1:37:01] physical conditions if we can look at
[1:37:04] who our god is of divine revelation
[1:37:07] then the lord can come and fight our
[1:37:08] battles you know you realize you're a
[1:37:10] son of god it does something to you

[1:37:20] back to that dominion amen well we are
[1:37:22] in charge and not the devil and it's not
[1:37:24] any spirit it's not any affliction not
[1:37:26] any trouble that rules us but we rule it

[1:47:05] praise the lord thank you brother ben
[1:47:06] that was i was in prayer last night and
[1:47:08] it was basically all the things that i
[1:47:10] was just meditating on last night you
[1:47:12] know i was thinking
[1:47:15] just we just
[1:47:16] when we we we can just be in our
[1:47:19] room we can be anywhere and we can enter
[1:47:20] into the throne room of almighty god and
[1:47:23] i was thinking how much of a privilege
[1:47:24] that is
[1:47:25] to
[1:47:27] be able to do that you know it's like
[1:47:29] and freely just walk in then i thought
[1:47:32] you know it's only by the grace of god
[1:47:34] that he softened our heart and put
[1:47:37] revelation in there that we desire to
[1:47:38] want to enter in because it's free to
[1:47:40] everyone to enter in but
[1:47:42] not everyone go everyone goes there
[1:47:44] but the the fact that we've been granted
[1:47:46] access to
[1:47:47] to
[1:47:49] fellowship with almighty god that
[1:47:50] revelation to be able to just go back
[1:47:52] there i was i thought this is this is
[1:47:53] the grandest thing ever for a mortal man
[1:47:56] this is a this is a pinnacle of man's
[1:47:58] existence he knows that we can go and
[1:48:00] have fellowship with almighty god
