[39:43] infirmity and he laid his hands on her
[39:45] and immediately she was made straight
[39:47] and glorified God
[39:49] and the ruler of the synagogue arms him
[39:51] with indignation because that Jesus had
[39:54] healed on the Sabbath day and said unto
[39:55] the people there are six days in which

[42:27] now formality comes in very many
[42:29] different forms but I just want to you
[42:31] it's amazing I just read the scripture
[42:33] in South Africa is interesting the
[42:34] things I wanted to preach on I didn't
[42:36] preach on the things I weren't weren't
[42:38] planning on preaching I preached on and
[42:39] I guess it's just how God works but you
[42:41] know it's amazing how you think about
[42:42] you I like to put myself in Bible
[42:44] stories who likes to put yourself in the
[42:46] gospels it's like you're there and
[42:47] everything goes on but it's amazing how
[42:49] you think about here here was a sister
[42:51] now she had she had this problem in her
[42:54] body for 18 years a spirit of infirmity
[42:56] had bound her that she could not even
[42:58] stand up straight about her over so you
[43:01] think about it that for 18 now who's
[43:03] younger than 18 here there's a few
[43:05] people younger than 18. so so this this
[43:08] woman had this problem where she was
[43:09] bowed over like this and she's coming to
[43:11] church maybe it was just about over the
[43:14] whole time and and for 18 years the
[43:17] church got used to her being in that
[43:18] condition and she became part of the
[43:21] service she they got people got used to
[43:23] her being in that condition now to me
[43:25] that really bothers me because you think
[43:27] they here were the here were the
[43:29] Believers of great Jehovah God you know
[43:31] they had the testimonies of Moses and
[43:34] Daniel and you know and David and you
[43:36] know Mighty Men and Caleb and Hannah and
[43:38] all the different testimonies down
[43:39] through the scripture and and you know
[43:41] the same God that that lived back then
[43:44] lived then you know but it was amazing
[43:46] they could get used to one of their own
[43:48] being bound by a spirit and to me this
[43:50] should bother us immensely you know when
[43:53] we see we should have such a love and a
[43:55] care and compassion for one another that
[43:57] you know it should drive us to prayer
[43:59] drive us to desperation the Lord would
[44:00] undertake for one another you know we
[44:03] should never ever look down on one
[44:04] another and say well they deserve it you
[44:06] know we all deserved hell be it the Lord
[44:09] Jesus interceded on our behalf he went
[44:11] to hell for you that you didn't need to
[44:13] go I say thank God for that amen I don't
[44:15] need to die a sinner because he died a
[44:16] sinner for me amen praise the Lord he
[44:19] took my sins upon his shoulders so we
[44:20] should never look down on one another
[44:22] when trouble strikes or when when a
[44:25] spirit comes in or something because you
[44:26] know we're all fighting this battle
[44:27] together you know this is not meant to
[44:30] be a Blue on Blue you know Friendly Fire
[44:32] kind of exercise but no our guns should
[44:35] be trained at the enemy and only at the
[44:37] enemy you know our criticism should be
[44:39] trained at the Devil you know all of our
[44:40] ill feeling whatever it shouldn't be at
[44:42] one another should be only at Satan and
[44:45] all of his devices right this is how we
[44:47] should be but it's amazing how she was
[44:50] in this condition 18 years
[44:52] it's a long time
[44:54] think about the
[44:57] just have a pause
[45:01] all right you know by the end he went
[45:03] through three interpreters in polokwati
[45:06] they couldn't keep up eventually the
[45:07] third one got there
[45:09] anyway praise a lot anyway praise God
[45:13] um
[45:13] yeah but but here she was for 18 years
[45:15] you think about that service after
[45:17] service
[45:18] should come in the front door bound
[45:20] she'd walk outbound you know
[45:23] service after service camp meeting after
[45:25] camp meeting Fellowship lunch after
[45:27] Fellowship lunch 30th birthday after
[45:29] 30th birthday 40th birthday after 40th
[45:32] birthday special meeting after special
[45:34] meeting should come in and go out the
[45:36] same way now we know God has a time and
[45:38] seasons for everyone right you know
[45:40] everyone God has a time and season to
[45:42] loose everyone now I I I I personally
[45:45] believe that that we're living in this
[45:47] season where the bride of Christ is no
[45:48] longer bound that God is here to loose
[45:51] us of all trouble of every Spirit of
[45:54] Affliction wherever it may be now I want
[45:56] to talk more about about spiritual being
[45:59] bound spiritually because we can be
[46:01] bound physically but if we're loose
[46:03] spiritually God can still work for us in
[46:05] a powerful way you know and you know and
[46:07] and sure physical binding oh God is here
[46:10] to heal but you know someone can come
[46:12] and bow and service after service and if
[46:15] we're not careful it can just become
[46:16] something we get used to instead of us
[46:19] interceding and praying that God in a
[46:21] season will will touch them and because
[46:23] remember God has no other voice on the
[46:25] earth lips but your lips he has no other
[46:27] hands but your hands no other feet but
[46:29] your feet no other heart but your heart
[46:31] no other mind but to use your mind right
[46:34] so God is depending upon you and I to
[46:36] call upon him that he can come upon the
[46:38] scene for for one another so yeah that's
[46:41] amazing because there came a day when
[46:43] when the very Jehovah God they claim to
[46:46] believe in walked in the church Messiah
[46:49] stepped in this was more than a prophet
[46:51] a more than a holy man more than just a
[46:53] Man from Nazareth but here was here was
[46:55] the Messiah the very the very one they
[46:58] are looking for the very hopes and
[47:00] consolation of Israel walked in the door
[47:01] and it's amazing because whenever he
[47:04] steps into the presence of his children
[47:05] and his children are hurting and they
[47:07] need a touch they need a hand he calls
[47:09] them to his side I mean I believe that's
[47:12] what the word does he doesn't just push
[47:13] us away you know if we're hurting if
[47:15] we're struggling if we're in pain God
[47:17] doesn't leave us in that condition amen
[47:19] but he comes and searches and finds us
[47:21] to gathers to himself as the grace of
[47:23] God I mean when when she could not lose
[47:25] herself he came to loose her and I'm I'm
[47:28] so thankful that the power of God
[47:30] nothing can conquer him amen he is the
[47:33] unconquerable one amen he is the mighty
[47:36] Victorious one so then she had said that
[47:38] he called her amen called her to him and
[47:43] said Woman Thou Art loose of thine
[47:45] infirmity amen and he laid his hands on
[47:47] her and immediately she was made
[47:49] straight and glorified God now you think
[47:51] the whole church would just erupt you
[47:53] know it would just be a praise break and
[47:55] God would just fall and you know the
[47:56] anointing would just touch everyone and
[47:58] it would just be a four or five hour
[48:00] meeting of just saying hallelujah
[48:02] but you know you'd think that right
[48:04] because here's your sister that's had
[48:06] this trouble been bound but yet she's
[48:08] yet she's persevered She's Come
[48:10] Faithfully to the house of God she's
[48:11] still a Believer she hasn't thrown her
[48:13] faith away but her faith has held of
[48:15] those 18 years she's been overcoming
[48:17] even in the bondage she's still
[48:19] Victorious but then the Messiah comes
[48:21] and touches her loses her you think the
[48:24] whole place would just erupt
[48:25] but the chief priest in the Pharisees
[48:28] and so on they said with indignation
[48:31] this is out of church order this is not
[48:34] how we do things around here this is not
[48:36] the day for this to happen this is not
[48:39] part of our program it's not part of our
[48:41] church service hey around here we just
[48:43] have three songs 45 minutes preaching
[48:45] then another song then we go out that's
[48:47] our order right no one says that Pete
[48:49] this is how it should be but you know
[48:50] Messiah walked in you know so it's
[48:53] amazing how people can get into a form
[48:55] of worship but yet they can miss the
[48:58] very God who steps on the seat and
[48:59] people can get upset when someone gets
[49:02] blessed I get happy when someone gets
[49:04] Bliss you know we watch some of the camp
[49:06] videos and things we saw people shouting
[49:08] rejoicing I thought man praise God lord
[49:10] pour and more touch more of them
[49:12] Hallelujah bless everyone more Lord
[49:15] Jesus it just makes me happy when God
[49:16] touches someone Hallelujah
[49:19] all right man brother Ben price other
[49:21] than the testimony on the scene 1962 he
[49:23] says you're still God you're still Jesus
[49:26] the Risen one we thank thee for these
[49:28] they're standing here they're your
[49:30] children there there's only one thing
[49:32] they can do is come and confess they're
[49:33] wrong and that he will confess his sins
[49:36] Shall Have Mercy he that hides his sin
[49:38] shall not Prosper you said so God and
[49:40] pray God that you'll break up the old
[49:42] cold formal spirit that tries to hold
[49:45] this revival in captivity that we will
[49:48] take it over in the name of the Lord
[49:50] Jesus and break the powers of Satan by
[49:52] the gospel of the resurrection and the
[49:54] presence of Jesus Christ in this dark
[49:56] evil hour so the your God yeah yeah the
[50:01] devil doesn't want us to to break into
[50:03] Revival he wants to hold a Revival
[50:05] captive to to to limit its influence
[50:07] limits it its effect limits it limit its
[50:10] power but I believe the Lord is here to
[50:12] break that cold formal Spirit now I'm
[50:14] going to go into formality because some
[50:16] people think being quite formal but it's
[50:18] not some people think dancing is not
[50:21] formal but it can be
[50:23] you see so we're going to get into that
[50:24] so don't just you know but you see you
[50:26] see but there's a spirit that wants to
[50:28] hold back a real heartfelt Revival in
[50:31] the word amen God wants us in Revival he
[50:33] wants us to be rejoicing and to be happy
[50:35] and to be thankful and you know just
[50:37] just appreciate him and love him more
[50:39] remember he can't love us anymore he
[50:41] showed his the fullness of his love that
[50:43] day on Calvary right he manifested his
[50:46] love to you that day on Calvary and he's
[50:48] told you that he loves you right and
[50:50] that is that is enough right he said so
[50:52] and he is a god of his word so I can
[50:54] rest in the fact he loves me amen amen
[50:57] and we also know his love because he has
[50:59] called you right his love is is an
[51:02] elective love it's not like a parent
[51:04] that you know parental care lovers like
[51:06] we want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap
[51:08] you know and keep them from all danger
[51:10] right who's who kind of parents are like
[51:13] that what's wrong with you parents you
[51:16] know what I mean you don't want your
[51:17] kids to run out on the street and maybe
[51:19] there's a truck and hey have some fun no
[51:21] you want to protect them right you don't
[51:23] want them for pancake you want them
[51:25] alive but you see God doesn't like that
[51:27] God allows us to go through trouble
[51:29] allows us to go through trials but his
[51:32] love is not shown in keeping us from
[51:34] trouble his love has shown in his
[51:36] election and his calling right he may
[51:39] allow you to go through trials remember
[51:40] he'll take you through the trial
[51:42] remember he is our great Shepherd he's
[51:44] not a Shepherd like New Zealand with
[51:45] dogs and quad bikes and sticks and
[51:48] whistles driving sheep he doesn't drive
[51:49] us he leads us so he steps into the
[51:52] trial before you ever get there
[51:55] Hallelujah and he doesn't leave you
[51:56] there he leads you all the way through
[51:58] you've got to remember that there's an
[51:59] end to every trial remember the devil
[52:01] has an expiry date every trial has an
[52:03] expiry date and when there's no more
[52:05] trials no more devil no more trouble we
[52:07] shall still be because we will be
[52:09] Eternal in the heavens glorifying God
[52:11] and all of that will just be an
[52:13] afterthought
[52:14] Hallelujah I mean I believe that dear
[52:17] you know normally normally yeah normally
[52:19] stuff in the fridge you throw away you
[52:21] kind of oh man I want him to eat that
[52:22] but the you know what I mean but you
[52:25] know I've never been happy yeah anyway
[52:28] we'll leave that one but you know the
[52:29] devil the clothes has expiry date gets
[52:31] the happier I get this guy's gonna not
[52:34] be thrown in the bin but in a lake of
[52:35] fire and he's not going to mold up my
[52:38] fridge no more not mold up my life he's
[52:40] gone
[52:40] praise a lot Hallelujah so we can
[52:43] Rejoice so so I pray that God would
[52:45] break up the old cold formal spirit that
[52:47] tries to hold the Revival in captivity
[52:49] maybe because God cannot be bound amen
[52:52] he will refuse us to be bound I believe
[52:54] his children refuse to be bound amen we
[52:56] refuse to be bound by culture or by
[52:59] criticism or by trouble or just our skin
[53:01] color whatever it is we refuse to be
[53:03] bound you know I was you know one of the
[53:06] last Services yeah everyone was dancing
[53:07] in the church in polokwanean I couldn't
[53:10] get through the Ark of all the sisters
[53:11] of dancing all the brothers around the
[53:13] pulpit so I could have snuck out the
[53:14] side and go around I start dancing with
[53:16] them and you know and then and then the
[53:18] song later got up the next morning says
[53:19] man I've never seen a white man dance
[53:21] like an African I thought praise God I
[53:23] must have some Rhythm somewhere but but
[53:26] then I said I didn't you know but I'm
[53:28] not a white man I'm a Christian I'm a
[53:31] Christian that's why I dance because I'm
[53:32] a Christian right so you know I just
[53:34] wanted to get rid of any kind of any any
[53:36] kind of you know we had a ball down
[53:39] walls eh I don't like walls well it
[53:43] should be just demolished and take out
[53:44] the foundation let's just Plum get rid
[53:46] of all that stuff Amen to the great
[53:48] people of God can rally together around
[53:49] him
[53:50] praise the Lord amen but you see we live
[53:53] in perilous times right we live in
[53:55] perilous times as it would say in second
[53:57] Timothy the Apostle Paul would say in
[53:59] the last days perilous times should come
[54:01] then he lists many troubles that would
[54:03] happen but he'd say that people would
[54:05] have a form of godliness because
[54:06] remember I mean normally people will
[54:08] read second Timothy we won't read the
[54:09] whole thing but you know your list being
[54:11] unthankful to Parents Without affection
[54:13] all those things be able to oh that's
[54:15] unbelievers but then it comes to he
[54:17] comes down to verse five he says having
[54:18] a form of godliness but denying the
[54:21] power of the thereof from such Eternal
[54:23] waste there'll be people upon the Earth
[54:25] that will have a form of godliness but
[54:28] they'll deny the power thereof so
[54:30] they'll be Christians now whenever I
[54:32] speak about these things like brother
[54:33] John Andy said at the camp you know we
[54:35] used to people we used to preach about
[54:36] come out of denomination and that's all
[54:38] wrong and blast those things and you
[54:40] know and in that few Generations ago
[54:42] people came out of the nomination they
[54:43] came out of systems but most of us
[54:46] didn't come out of those things we were
[54:48] raised in the truth so what's the point
[54:50] of saying we're free of that when we're
[54:51] well we're born free what do you mean
[54:54] you know so so when I look at these
[54:56] scriptures I always try and apply it to
[54:57] myself and not someone out there because
[54:59] the Bible you know we're going to bring
[55:00] it on home right so when it says having
[55:02] a form of godliness but denying the
[55:04] power thereof I don't put it out outside
[55:06] in some other church I said this this
[55:09] Spirit can come into the ranks of the
[55:11] believer because remember we're not
[55:13] immune from anything right just because
[55:15] you met God you don't get a free pass
[55:17] right actually the battle gets harder
[55:19] because the devil because you have
[55:21] something the devil wants but you can't
[55:23] give it to them because you've already
[55:24] given your life to the Lord right the
[55:26] reason he fights you is because he wants
[55:28] your life but you won't give him your
[55:30] life because you've given your life to
[55:31] the Lord hallelujah so so he fights you
[55:34] amen then then sure yeah but so it's
[55:36] expected but you've got to realize the
[55:38] one in you has already overcome whatever
[55:40] trial whatever Spirit whatever's come
[55:42] against you he has already overcome it
[55:45] the one in you so it's like brother
[55:47] Brahm says you know just say you got
[55:49] cancer you really have cancer some
[55:50] people just try and deny everything
[55:51] that's not overcoming brother and says
[55:54] when you recognize the enemy but also
[55:57] recognize the one in you has already
[55:59] conquered him that is overcoming
[56:02] Hallelujah so we don't bear it we're not
[56:04] a bunch of ostriches eh
[56:06] no we're Eagles right we don't bear our
[56:08] head in the sand we fly in the heavens
[56:10] right when the storm comes we go above
[56:12] the storm we don't bear our heads in the
[56:14] sand amen so sure trouble may be there
[56:16] you may be having the greatest trial of
[56:18] your life but there's one greater than
[56:20] the trail and he's with you in the trial
[56:22] he wants to show himself in the trail
[56:24] Hallelujah so we can have such you know
[56:26] I'm so glad being a Christian who's
[56:28] happy to be a believer doesn't matter
[56:29] what comes or goes we can say praise God
[56:31] anyhow holy that our Lord is in control
[56:34] he's greater than everything all the
[56:36] world he's greater than it all he's in
[56:38] control of this world over the devil's
[56:40] the king of this world yeah but who's
[56:42] who allows the devil to do certain
[56:43] things like the devil would come before
[56:45] God about job and and you know God would
[56:48] tell uh the enemy you can come this far
[56:50] but you can't cross this line so the
[56:53] first line was you can't touch him you
[56:55] can do what he wants just don't touch
[56:56] him amen and then so the devil pushed as
[56:58] hard as he could but he couldn't cross
[56:59] the line and he said well you know you
[57:01] can touch his body
[57:03] but he can't take his life he took him
[57:05] to the eighth degree
[57:06] but he couldn't take his life
[57:08] what God sets boundaries for Satan
[57:12] Hallelujah you know we're contending
[57:14] with a defeated foe we're contending
[57:16] with a limited foe he can't cross God's
[57:19] command he wants to he thinks he's in
[57:21] control no no he's just allowed to do
[57:23] certain things
[57:24] so we should never despair at this world
[57:26] we should say praise God God you're in
[57:29] control and even in this chaos we can
[57:31] walk as overcome as Victorious
[57:33] Hallelujah aren't you glad you know
[57:35] people walk around sad and you know
[57:37] empty
[57:38] but we can walk around rejoicing amen
[57:41] and happy and say Lord
[57:43] I think brother Tesla put a status on
[57:45] WhatsApp a while ago he said Lord may I
[57:47] live such a life people will easily find
[57:48] you
[57:49] I thought that is such a powerful I said
[57:52] Lord may that be me
[57:53] that I that you live in my life in such
[57:55] a way Lord that people easily find you
[57:57] when they come into my presence amen
[57:59] because because we have what the world
[58:00] needs the world doesn't need more zeros
[58:03] in the bank
[58:03] right it doesn't need less interest
[58:05] rates it does it needs the Lord Jesus
[58:07] Christ amen because all those things
[58:10] they'll fail eventually but he can never
[58:12] fail
[58:13] Hallelujah is having a form of godliness
[58:15] now this this word form it means a a a a
[58:18] a a a a shaping
[58:20] it means the mere form a semblance it
[58:24] means the you know it's the it's the
[58:26] outward form it's a structure
[58:28] but it's not it's the you know it's not
[58:30] actually the real thing
[58:32] it's like when you put boxing for you
[58:34] know brother Albert puts a boxing for um
[58:36] you know foundations there's a form is
[58:38] it called a form
[58:40] yeah there we go that one you know but
[58:42] you see it's not the it's not the
[58:43] foundation it's just a you know it's you
[58:46] know it's just the boxing whatever it's
[58:47] the outside and we can have the we can
[58:49] have the form just right
[58:50] so we can so so the outward form we can
[58:53] have the dress just right we can quote
[58:55] the word just right we can believe just
[58:56] right we can be baptized right never put
[58:59] a foot wrong when it comes to anything
[59:02] but that's just the outward four that's
[59:04] not that's not the real thing that's
[59:06] just the outward form so we can have a
[59:08] form of godliness even even among
[59:10] Believers amen we can be we can even
[59:13] dance around the church
[59:16] and I'm all for dancing you know being
[59:18] brother Andy's saying man we need more
[59:19] space up here this is this ain't gonna
[59:21] work no more
[59:22] praise a lot but you see formality comes
[59:26] not if you're quiet or if you're loud
[59:28] but formality is if your heart is not in
[59:31] it if there's not a heartfelt religion
[59:34] then it's just a form see because a form
[59:36] can just be where you conform to what
[59:39] your culture dictates to you right so so
[59:42] so here well we're well I don't know who
[59:44] it is but so apparently some people are
[59:46] conservative I don't I don't I don't
[59:48] that's not me I can't put myself there
[59:50] or maybe this color but I'm not that I'm
[59:53] a Christian right but but some people
[59:55] think well it's Godly to be formal and
[59:57] quiet and and reverent
[59:59] you know and then people fit into that
[1:00:01] and they say well they've really got it
[1:00:03] praise God they're a real believer but
[1:00:05] they can just be conforming to a culture
[1:00:07] and then it's the same thing you know
[1:00:09] you know even in Africa everyone dances
[1:00:11] around but it can just be a form there's
[1:00:14] people there dancing who really know God
[1:00:15] and they're having a rejoicing time but
[1:00:17] there's people dancing because everyone
[1:00:18] else is dancing just like here people
[1:00:20] are quiet they can be rejoicing tear run
[1:00:22] down their cheek and they can be having
[1:00:23] the greatest moment ever in the presence
[1:00:25] of God you know brother Brahman deep
[1:00:27] calls the Deep there's a man standing in
[1:00:29] front of him in the prayer line he's
[1:00:30] just standing like a bit of stone
[1:00:31] brother says no I can see you're excited
[1:00:34] he said he doesn't look excited but what
[1:00:37] brother Brown was saying is this man's
[1:00:38] excited because his life is being
[1:00:40] discerned by the angel of God rights you
[1:00:42] can never really tell on the outside
[1:00:45] really what God is doing on the inside
[1:00:47] sure what is inside does come out
[1:00:49] eventually but you know someone can be
[1:00:51] shouting and jumping amen and jumping on
[1:00:53] the chairs but no life and it can just
[1:00:56] be a form of godliness right or someone
[1:00:58] can be sitting there quiet and just say
[1:01:00] well actually and some people say well
[1:01:01] that person's got nothing but that could
[1:01:03] be God could be living in their life in
[1:01:04] a powerful way you know that the very
[1:01:06] God of heaven lives in that person in
[1:01:08] such a powerful way but you say well
[1:01:10] that person's just formal are they
[1:01:13] see we gotta we're gonna break formality
[1:01:16] even here we're a bit loud or what I
[1:01:19] don't know but you know people can just
[1:01:21] conform yeah to the church or go to
[1:01:23] another church they change to that
[1:01:24] church they just conform to that church
[1:01:26] we shouldn't conform to a church right
[1:01:29] we should worship God how we feel led to
[1:01:31] worship God because remember if the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost is leading you it's never out of
[1:01:35] order
[1:01:37] right it's never out of order you may be
[1:01:39] like the priest you're criticizing that
[1:01:41] woman for being loosed and shouting and
[1:01:43] glorifying God but she was right in
[1:01:45] order why because Messiah touched your
[1:01:47] life Messiah changed her life she was no
[1:01:50] longer bound by that Spirit but she
[1:01:52] stood upright and glorified God and I
[1:01:54] believe when the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:55] touches someone amen bound down by a sin
[1:01:58] by complexes pains and hurts the law can
[1:02:01] touch that person they stand upright
[1:02:02] they say that thing won't bow me down no
[1:02:04] more amen it's under my feet the Lord
[1:02:06] has conquered I am free Hallelujah I
[1:02:09] believe we have something to Rejoice
[1:02:10] about amen this morning Hallelujah in
[1:02:13] this 2023 we can praise God I mean why
[1:02:16] because he is loosedus I mean this
[1:02:18] message is a this message is not a bunch
[1:02:20] of rules and bind people down if you've
[1:02:23] got that idea about our Lord you haven't
[1:02:24] met him I mean you've just made a
[1:02:26] message culture that is wrong I mean no
[1:02:28] this message is the most liberating
[1:02:30] message that's ever struck the earth I
[1:02:33] mean that we're not bound by Church
[1:02:34] culture not bound by religion not bound
[1:02:36] by Creeds or anything of man or culture
[1:02:38] whatever we are loosed in the Holy Ghost
[1:02:40] that we can walk with God like he wants
[1:02:43] us to walk with him
[1:02:45] look he walked with God
[1:02:47] then one day he just took a step further
[1:02:49] and went from this world to the next and
[1:02:51] it's like you and I the Lord wants us to
[1:02:53] walk with him I mean he wants us to walk
[1:02:55] with him in his word amen that we have a
[1:02:57] relationship when we read his word it
[1:02:59] touches our lives and when we hear the
[1:03:02] message it touches Our Lives I mean when
[1:03:04] we pray to him it's not some cold formal
[1:03:06] ritual but it's a heartfelt prayer now
[1:03:09] you may be emotional or not but you'll
[1:03:10] know when God touches you hey man you
[1:03:13] can be very expressive that's fine you
[1:03:15] can be quiet that's fine but when God
[1:03:16] touches your heart I mean that's when
[1:03:18] you're no longer formal
[1:03:20] why because God is dealing God is
[1:03:22] working hallelujah amen and that is the
[1:03:25] most blessed thing that's what brother
[1:03:26] Braham said the end of the church age
[1:03:27] book this one thing he wanted to
[1:03:29] established was a true relationship with
[1:03:31] God and man
[1:03:33] that's what he wanted that was the
[1:03:34] summation of that church age because
[1:03:36] that's what he wanted to see amen and
[1:03:38] that's what we want to see that everyone
[1:03:39] here would have a true relationship with
[1:03:42] the Lord Jesus Christ they wouldn't just
[1:03:44] know about him they would know him amen
[1:03:46] and in the good times they would know
[1:03:48] him in the good and on the hard times
[1:03:49] they would know him in every moment of
[1:03:51] Life trouble sometimes they would depend
[1:03:53] upon him that's what he wants Hallelujah
[1:03:56] I'm so glad our God is Not Just up in
[1:03:57] heaven someplace amen but he's a living
[1:03:59] God that's present Among Us amen and not
[1:04:02] just in these four walls I mean but in
[1:04:04] our everyday life Hallelujah I mean we
[1:04:06] can turn our Help Cometh From The Lord
[1:04:08] hallelujah I'm so thankful that we have
[1:04:10] a guy aren't you glad
[1:04:12] Hallelujah I'm simple I just get happy
[1:04:14] about simple things I just get happy I
[1:04:16] met him you know he found me hallelujah
[1:04:19] hallelujah
[1:04:21] praise God you know some people are
[1:04:22] afraid
[1:04:24] of what the Holy Ghost might might cause
[1:04:26] them to do
[1:04:28] yeah you know you might speak in tongues
[1:04:30] you might not you might shout a cry or
[1:04:33] dance or you might not but are you
[1:04:35] willing to let the Lord live through you
[1:04:37] that's why a lot of people are afraid of
[1:04:39] the new birth is because they're afraid
[1:04:40] of what God might have them do but are
[1:04:42] you willing to let God do it
[1:04:45] Hallelujah that's how we should be
[1:04:47] because if we're not willing to let God
[1:04:49] live it because it becomes a form
[1:04:52] amen it's you know we don't want to just
[1:04:54] have a form of godliness
[1:04:58] but we want the character of the Lord
[1:05:00] Jesus Christ the word living in US
[1:05:02] amen a real heartfelt religion
[1:05:06] Hallelujah because formality is
[1:05:08] manifested by not allowing or letting
[1:05:10] the Lord change our lives
[1:05:12] amen because of our hearts are soft
[1:05:14] towards him we want him to meet us and
[1:05:15] speak to us that's a heartfelt religion
[1:05:17] God connects on that level
[1:05:19] I mean not in our heads you know a lot
[1:05:21] of people they want to learn the message
[1:05:22] or they want to learn the Bible this is
[1:05:24] not some I praise God not a university
[1:05:26] it's not some trade school you've got to
[1:05:29] sit some exams praise God hallelujah I
[1:05:32] sat in a lot of exam times I'm so
[1:05:33] thankful I'm not here setting exams I'm
[1:05:36] so thankful this is not some calculus or
[1:05:39] some chemistry lecture and you've got to
[1:05:41] absorb some teaching and then try and
[1:05:43] regurgitate it later and those that
[1:05:45] regurgitated well they've really got it
[1:05:46] no they just remembered something no
[1:05:48] it's when the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:05:50] changes the life amen that our character
[1:05:52] becomes like his character that is the
[1:05:55] most important thing amen see people are
[1:05:57] afraid of fanaticism but I say if the
[1:06:00] Holy Ghost is anointing you he will
[1:06:02] never lead you into fanaticism he will
[1:06:04] keep you in the middle of the road right
[1:06:07] he will keep you in reality not going
[1:06:09] into fanaticism he will keep you in his
[1:06:12] word
[1:06:14] Hallelujah see no he says here then
[1:06:16] doesn't Jehovah Jireh he says now that's
[1:06:18] about the way our church is gone it just
[1:06:20] took in a bunch of under cold formal
[1:06:22] profession some Mystic dance or some
[1:06:25] sensation what do they do just believe
[1:06:26] the word till they got a nest full of
[1:06:28] rotten eggs it's time to clean the nest
[1:06:29] and start over again I mean until
[1:06:31] they're in contact with the male Christ
[1:06:33] Jesus get born again of the word then
[1:06:35] they got to hatch because it's life so
[1:06:37] you're saying that people can have some
[1:06:39] kind of a dance or some sensation but
[1:06:41] that's not Etsy it's got to be a
[1:06:43] heartfelt religion where you've
[1:06:44] surrendered to the word of God Amen then
[1:06:46] that breaks all formality
[1:06:48] because you're not just coming to church
[1:06:50] just like you know that you know that
[1:06:52] you know that uh Rabbi or whatever he
[1:06:54] wanted his his synagogue just to be a
[1:06:56] formal thing we come in well this day we
[1:06:59] read these these certain pages from the
[1:07:01] Torah and we go out and we come back and
[1:07:03] we go out that's what the devil wants we
[1:07:05] come in we go out nothing happens God
[1:07:09] doesn't do nothing you know we just go
[1:07:10] through a form of religion nice songs
[1:07:13] better motivational talking and then we
[1:07:16] go out
[1:07:17] but God's not looking for that kind of a
[1:07:19] church amen but that's what that's the
[1:07:21] kind of church the devil's looking for
[1:07:22] but God wants a people our sons and
[1:07:25] daughters of him full of a spirit where
[1:07:27] everyone is part of the spiritual
[1:07:29] worship see it's not just not just an
[1:07:31] anointed preacher and then the people
[1:07:33] are trying to grasp things but the
[1:07:34] people are just as anointed as the
[1:07:36] preachers we are we are all just
[1:07:38] anointed as a song leader or the
[1:07:40] musicians we're all Anointed with the
[1:07:42] Holy Ghost we're all here to be
[1:07:43] partakers of the same Holy Ghost worship
[1:07:46] Hallelujah that's why we're here right I
[1:07:48] ain't meant to worship Him in spirit and
[1:07:50] in truth this is our portion this is
[1:07:51] your inheritance oh look it's better
[1:07:54] than uh I don't know a new house so this
[1:07:56] is your inheritance to worship Him in
[1:07:57] spirit and in truth
[1:08:00] Hallelujah he says here in as a message
[1:08:02] Abraham he says now he says the
[1:08:04] Pentecostal church is getting cold and
[1:08:06] formal going right back into the depths
[1:08:08] of organization and then he says and as
[1:08:10] long as we belong to the church that's
[1:08:12] all that's necessary so it's linking
[1:08:15] organization with Justice Just this
[1:08:18] Mantra or the slogan while we belong to
[1:08:20] the church that's all we need
[1:08:22] we got a more than this there's no
[1:08:24] membership here
[1:08:25] any church I know in this country
[1:08:27] there's no membership
[1:08:28] if there's any membership I'm gone
[1:08:30] I resign see you later goodbye but see
[1:08:33] there's a mentality comes in well I'm in
[1:08:36] the message what does that even mean
[1:08:39] you know I'm in Stokes Valley what is
[1:08:41] that you know what does that mean here I
[1:08:43] am but
[1:08:44] and you know I'm in the message A lot of
[1:08:47] people are in the message but are you is
[1:08:48] the message in you is Jesus Christ the
[1:08:50] word in you see that's the thing see we
[1:08:52] we never get into heaven by association
[1:08:55] right we're not going into Rapture
[1:08:57] because we come to this building
[1:08:59] this is not you don't go through that
[1:09:01] door now you now your raps are ready
[1:09:03] because you come no this is not how this
[1:09:04] works
[1:09:07] well you know him it doesn't matter
[1:09:08] where you go you're ready you know
[1:09:10] people are asking me about is this age
[1:09:12] long or short how long's the lady in
[1:09:14] church age gonna be I just say well as
[1:09:16] long as the people are in the Holy Ghost
[1:09:18] they are ready if they go by the way I
[1:09:21] don't actually care how long the ages
[1:09:24] as long as I'm ready
[1:09:26] if I go by the way the grave I'm ready
[1:09:28] because it did in Christ's race first if
[1:09:30] I'm alive and remain well I'm ready
[1:09:31] doesn't matter if I'm asleep or if I'm
[1:09:34] awake whenever the Rapture happens I
[1:09:36] could be snoring my head off but I'll
[1:09:37] wake up in Glory Hallelujah why because
[1:09:40] he has made me ready right and that's
[1:09:43] the main thing amen it's not about dates
[1:09:45] and ages and times whatever no no are
[1:09:47] you ready do you have your token in your
[1:09:50] heart do you have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:09:52] life if you do then you are Rapture
[1:09:54] Ready
[1:09:54] everything you have needle for life's
[1:09:56] journey is within you the prophecy the
[1:09:58] Rapture is within you if you have the
[1:09:59] Holy Ghost what a Blessed Assurance we
[1:10:01] have I mean we can be so relaxed
[1:10:04] not lacks but relaxed it's big
[1:10:07] difference Lex says you don't care you
[1:10:09] just float along in life but if you're
[1:10:10] if you're relaxed you can rest in God
[1:10:13] I believe we can do that
[1:10:15] Hallelujah well you're just so bound
[1:10:17] down and eternal security absolutely I
[1:10:19] believe in eternal security I believe
[1:10:22] the Lord did not save me to lose me
[1:10:25] right he saved me to keep me he come to
[1:10:27] seek and save that which was lost so I
[1:10:30] was in his in his mind I was found but I
[1:10:33] was born into the Earth I was born last
[1:10:34] he came to find me Hallelujah so I can
[1:10:37] have full Assurance maybe I'm just too
[1:10:39] far on that limb but I well I I don't
[1:10:41] think so because I believe our God is a
[1:10:42] god of stability he doesn't make us
[1:10:44] guessing and troubled and worried am I
[1:10:46] going to make it am I not no he wants to
[1:10:48] eradicate that question out of your
[1:10:50] heart he wants you to know that you're
[1:10:52] going
[1:10:53] that you've actually if you've got the
[1:10:55] Holy Ghost it's as good as if you're
[1:10:57] already there why because you are sealed
[1:10:59] to the day of your destination amen
[1:11:01] you're sealed to that time right so you
[1:11:03] know we got our ticket in our hand
[1:11:05] praise God now if you think on those
[1:11:09] things all formality should go away
[1:11:11] because remember the our our enemy does
[1:11:14] not want us to have a heartfelt religion
[1:11:17] and he wants us just to cabbage down and
[1:11:19] just get this idea well as long as we
[1:11:21] belong to church that's all we need well
[1:11:24] our kids are raising the message and you
[1:11:26] know we've applied the token it's all
[1:11:28] they've got to meet God
[1:11:29] they have to have their own experience
[1:11:31] and I believe it's their right to have a
[1:11:34] holy ghost Revival a powerful Holy Ghost
[1:11:36] revolve we are so bless you Melanie and
[1:11:39] Christine were singing she'll kill me
[1:11:40] later but you know you know those two
[1:11:42] started a Revival in Tauranga by prayer
[1:11:45] they pray take God moving our church
[1:11:47] when I see you live and the Lord spoke
[1:11:49] said I'm gonna move Hallelujah and God
[1:11:52] put his Spirit out and he also said I'll
[1:11:53] cause some to come and some to leave
[1:11:55] that's exactly what happened right the
[1:11:57] power of God moved just two two young
[1:11:59] people praying in a bedroom had a burden
[1:12:02] for God to live see their siblings meet
[1:12:04] God in the church everything and what
[1:12:05] happened that happened yes yeah
[1:12:07] Hallelujah and I believe every
[1:12:09] generation has a right my children have
[1:12:11] a right to see God move in their lives
[1:12:13] to see the power of God where they come
[1:12:15] and start testifying to me Daddy I was
[1:12:17] praying we're praying in our room and
[1:12:19] God came down yeah try and wake them up
[1:12:21] the morning why are you so tired well we
[1:12:23] had a prayer meeting last night God just
[1:12:24] came down and I don't know what time it
[1:12:26] was we're shouting and praising that
[1:12:28] would just bless my heart
[1:12:30] Hallelujah I'd say no I want some of
[1:12:32] that Hallelujah can I can I come in and
[1:12:35] join you that's what I would love to see
[1:12:37] because every generation deserves a
[1:12:39] Revival they deserve to see God alive
[1:12:43] hallelujah amen that's how I feel so we
[1:12:47] should live in such a way Lord may we
[1:12:49] not be a stumbling block to our own
[1:12:51] children because remember they said us
[1:12:53] at our best and at our worst they do and
[1:12:56] they see everything in between God help
[1:12:58] us
[1:13:00] so you know may we may we not get in
[1:13:03] their way
[1:13:04] Hallelujah amen but we can't have this
[1:13:06] mentality well just as long as our
[1:13:08] children church and you know they're in
[1:13:10] the message that no they have to have
[1:13:12] their own personal experience we all
[1:13:14] must know him personally remember we're
[1:13:16] not we no one will get in by association
[1:13:18] it's only by knowing him they're going
[1:13:21] in a rapture amen so it's absolutely
[1:13:24] important you know let's see now it's
[1:13:27] amazing if we go to Matthew 21 I I like
[1:13:30] it when Jesus goes to church
[1:13:33] he causes he causes trouble
[1:13:36] some love it some don't love it
[1:13:39] Hallelujah so now he's coming to the
[1:13:40] temple this is Matthew 21 verse 12. so
[1:13:43] Jesus goes into the temple now you can
[1:13:45] put it up or not that's fine you know he
[1:13:47] goes to the temple and you see
[1:13:49] immediately he begins to rearrange
[1:13:51] everything
[1:13:51] see man had changed the temple from a
[1:13:55] place of a house of prayer to where God
[1:13:58] comes on the scene to a money-making
[1:14:00] religious system it had just boiled down
[1:14:03] to three songs 45 minutes one song at
[1:14:07] the end that's all we do now if people
[1:14:09] do that that's fine but if you just keep
[1:14:10] it as a full stop that's it you know you
[1:14:12] can't be rigid right you've got to let
[1:14:13] God move amen Amy you got to get you let
[1:14:16] the Holy Ghost move in a service right
[1:14:17] that's what we want all right yeah I
[1:14:20] trust that's what you're looking for
[1:14:21] that's what I look for
[1:14:22] why are you away from the supernatural
[1:14:24] God is Supernatural this message is
[1:14:26] Supernatural the word is Supernatural
[1:14:28] amen so we should see God move
[1:14:30] Hallelujah so so remember the temple was
[1:14:33] a place where where where uh where
[1:14:36] Isaiah would come and see see the vision
[1:14:38] of God
[1:14:39] high and lifted up and God would
[1:14:41] commission him to go and be a prophet
[1:14:43] and you know Hannah would pray there you
[1:14:45] know when it was just a Tabernacle in
[1:14:47] the wilderness and she would get a
[1:14:48] prophet son you know there are many
[1:14:50] powerful things would happen there you
[1:14:52] know they'd go and pray they'd call upon
[1:14:53] God because the enemies were all around
[1:14:54] and God would anoint someone and speak
[1:14:57] and tell them what to do but you see it
[1:14:59] had become because over time tradition
[1:15:01] had crept in and and and and the fire of
[1:15:05] Revival had gone out see we must never
[1:15:07] let the fire of Revival go out see some
[1:15:10] people say well every Revival will just
[1:15:12] be three years well that may be someone
[1:15:14] else's experience but I I'm not claiming
[1:15:17] that for me
[1:15:19] Hallelujah well it's been three years
[1:15:21] it's all over now just no who says who
[1:15:24] said that has to be that way can't we
[1:15:27] have a rejoicing heartfelt love of God
[1:15:29] see him live every day of our life
[1:15:31] brother Graham said a man can be drunk
[1:15:33] on the spirit every day of his life till
[1:15:35] he leaves this Earth Hallelujah now to
[1:15:38] me that's not just pie in the sky I
[1:15:39] believe that's we can have that
[1:15:41] do you want it are you addicted that bad
[1:15:44] that you've got to have another drink oh
[1:15:46] my your whole life is just just just
[1:15:48] molded around I've got to get the bottle
[1:15:50] I've got to get the bottle I've got to
[1:15:52] have another drink Hallelujah
[1:15:55] praise God hallelujah there's underage
[1:15:57] drinking allowed in this place by the
[1:15:58] way well it's not just for adults amen
[1:16:01] it's for everyone praise God hallelujah
[1:16:04] amen but you see they had turned it into
[1:16:06] this kind of just yo yo yo all they were
[1:16:08] interested in in selling sacrifices and
[1:16:11] and you know but but there was still a
[1:16:12] form of godliness they still come
[1:16:15] according to the word they offered the
[1:16:16] right sacrifices according to the word
[1:16:18] the Levites were the Levites all those
[1:16:20] things they you know but it turned into
[1:16:22] just a form of worship
[1:16:25] and then the Lord comes in and he gets
[1:16:27] rid of the thing that the people are
[1:16:29] holding in the highest esteem which is
[1:16:31] making money out of the sacrifices
[1:16:32] because he always attacks that religious
[1:16:35] spirit right on the head right so so he
[1:16:38] goes and he kicks all that out and you
[1:16:40] see it says that see my house shall be
[1:16:42] called a House of Prayer or the House of
[1:16:45] Prayer now when you think about prayer
[1:16:46] prayer is not just us speaking into the
[1:16:48] ceiling or us kneeling on a you know
[1:16:50] speaking down into the ground no prayer
[1:16:53] is communion with God
[1:16:54] Paris communion with God you know I you
[1:16:57] know I put the brother and he made the
[1:16:58] poster for one of our camps and I put it
[1:17:00] out the front door where it says that
[1:17:02] God how we thank you we can speak to you
[1:17:04] we're so thankful to be on speaking
[1:17:07] terms the blood of Jesus Christ puts us
[1:17:09] in this condition see it's not us that
[1:17:12] puts us in that condition but his blood
[1:17:14] puts us in condition to speak to him
[1:17:16] amen it's not us that does it it's his
[1:17:18] blood that has done it so you know
[1:17:20] brother Braham says that someone who
[1:17:22] just gets saved right then has more
[1:17:24] Authority with God in heaven than an
[1:17:26] archangel that never fell so here you
[1:17:28] are you've stumbled in darkness you've
[1:17:29] been bound with sin unbelief and
[1:17:31] Gabriel's there Michael's they're the
[1:17:33] archangels they're talking to God but
[1:17:34] then you surrender your life to the Lord
[1:17:36] you give your life to him and then you
[1:17:38] start talking to him they have to be
[1:17:40] quiet because he says my son or my
[1:17:42] daughter's talking to me and it was just
[1:17:44] a second ago they gave their lives to
[1:17:46] Lord
[1:17:47] he tells them to be quiet for you to
[1:17:49] speak to him yeah
[1:17:50] Hallelujah How Great Is Our God he's
[1:17:52] more interested in your voice than the
[1:17:55] archangel's voices that never fell your
[1:17:57] voice your prayer Hallelujah so prayers
[1:18:00] prayer is a communion right so that you
[1:18:03] call on God who's that answered prayer
[1:18:05] before
[1:18:06] hallelujah what is that you talk to God
[1:18:09] and then God supernaturally did
[1:18:11] something back according to your prayer
[1:18:13] see prayer wasn't just a form but it was
[1:18:15] but it it is fellowship with God prayer
[1:18:19] is to change our minds to match his mind
[1:18:21] right prayer is to intercede for one
[1:18:23] another prayer is the one of the most
[1:18:25] powerful weapons ever placed in your
[1:18:27] hand not just in the preacher's hand and
[1:18:29] everyone's hand you can be a little
[1:18:30] child you know I often remind you know I
[1:18:32] tell it quite a lot around you know
[1:18:34] because there's a five and a half year
[1:18:36] gap between Gabriella and William now
[1:18:38] tell the story how Annelise came to us
[1:18:39] and said well we want a baby
[1:18:41] and and she said well what do you mean
[1:18:43] she said well we voted three against two
[1:18:45] where's our baby I said well it didn't
[1:18:46] work that way yeah it doesn't work that
[1:18:48] way and she and she looked at me with
[1:18:50] that serious face she has and says and
[1:18:52] says well we're gonna go pray
[1:18:54] six-year-old girl or I know what age
[1:18:56] seven
[1:18:57] there he is
[1:19:00] but that was prayer
[1:19:02] prayer had to change my heart prayer had
[1:19:04] to bring life
[1:19:06] a life-giving prayer
[1:19:08] little little girls praying for life
[1:19:10] life came
[1:19:12] Hallelujah
[1:19:13] so praise powerful
[1:19:15] right never ever diminish your prayers
[1:19:18] no God wants to hear you talk to him he
[1:19:21] knows all about it but he wants you to
[1:19:24] tell him
[1:19:25] how you're feeling what you're going
[1:19:27] through what you're facing what help
[1:19:28] whatever it is even just if you can't
[1:19:30] think of anything to pray just just tell
[1:19:32] him how much he means to you
[1:19:35] yeah then you'll start having a prayer
[1:19:36] meeting
[1:19:37] Hallelujah
[1:19:39] so they were people were praying people
[1:19:40] still would have been praying there even
[1:19:42] though you know it turned into a den of
[1:19:44] Thieves you know it says that the you
[1:19:47] know it says that the um blind and the
[1:19:49] lame came to him in the temple so they
[1:19:51] would have been sitting there they would
[1:19:53] have still been there they didn't just
[1:19:54] turn up because Jesus turned up they
[1:19:56] were already there praying but they
[1:19:58] turned into a den of Thieves now that
[1:20:00] what had become a cold formal way of
[1:20:02] worship but then when Messiah when our
[1:20:04] lord Jesus stepped into that Temple he
[1:20:06] began to rearrange it to how it should
[1:20:08] be and then and then they blind and the
[1:20:10] lame came to him because they couldn't
[1:20:12] get any help from the priest but they
[1:20:14] came to the one who the priests were
[1:20:15] claiming to worship and then he healed
[1:20:18] them
[1:20:18] and then a real Ruckus begin to happen
[1:20:20] because it says in all the chief priests
[1:20:23] and scribes saw the wonderful things
[1:20:24] that he did now you think that there'd
[1:20:26] be just an eruption from everyone from
[1:20:27] the top to the bottom and then the
[1:20:29] children were crying in the temple
[1:20:31] saying Hosanna to the son of David
[1:20:33] so so now the young people started
[1:20:36] getting vocal where once they were
[1:20:38] sitting quiet and not understood then
[1:20:39] they began to praise God why because the
[1:20:42] Messiah walked into church Hallelujah
[1:20:44] and they began to praise God so you know
[1:20:46] never ever dampen a young person when
[1:20:48] they get a bit happy we should encourage
[1:20:51] that we should encourage it never say
[1:20:52] well if you're a Christian you shouldn't
[1:20:54] do this no no no no encourage them and
[1:20:57] the Lord if they sing a special praise
[1:20:58] God where's Debbie where's Debbie she
[1:21:01] sang at the camp that was the most
[1:21:03] blessed special I ever heard of that
[1:21:05] whole meeting God bless you and I mean
[1:21:07] that I was I heard that song I was
[1:21:09] crying like praise God that blessed me
[1:21:12] that really did see we should always
[1:21:13] encourage our young people when they
[1:21:15] sing when they do anything for God
[1:21:17] hallelujah so they're crying and
[1:21:19] praising God the children were and all
[1:21:21] the scribes and chief priests they saw
[1:21:23] these things they were so displeased
[1:21:25] they weren't happy about it they're
[1:21:28] saying this is out of order where's the
[1:21:31] contact order Doctrine book this is not
[1:21:32] right this is not how we do things why
[1:21:35] what happened is because when the Lord
[1:21:37] came into the temple he came to restore
[1:21:39] a heartfelt praise
[1:21:41] a heartfelt religion
[1:21:43] not a formality but these ones these
[1:21:46] ones were so bound up and rituals they
[1:21:48] were not happy with what he was doing
[1:21:50] now what are we going oh boy okay you
[1:21:53] see man made the house of God into a
[1:21:55] money-making ritual form
[1:21:57] but it was a house it should have been a
[1:21:59] house of prayer and deliverance
[1:22:02] and then you know
[1:22:04] and then and then the scribes and
[1:22:05] Pharisees said to the Lord don't you
[1:22:07] hear what these ones are saying and
[1:22:09] Jesus said unto them yea but haven't you
[1:22:11] read out of the mouths of babes and
[1:22:12] sucklings thou has perfected praise so
[1:22:16] here was a response to what God had done
[1:22:17] in their midst and it was a perfect
[1:22:19] praise out of the young people's lives I
[1:22:22] say praise God this is how it should be
[1:22:25] amen that that really because remember
[1:22:27] church is in a way it's generational but
[1:22:29] it shouldn't be generational it
[1:22:31] shouldn't be the old people and the
[1:22:33] young people and there's the young
[1:22:34] people here's the like it's some big
[1:22:35] golf no we're all brothers and sisters
[1:22:38] by the way we're actually all the same
[1:22:40] age in God Amen We're All in This
[1:22:42] Together
[1:22:43] amen because remember in eternity
[1:22:44] they're going to be the same age as you
[1:22:46] you're going to be the same age as them
[1:22:47] amen so we should always pull up our
[1:22:50] children put everyone around and say
[1:22:51] let's rally let's rally around the Lord
[1:22:53] and worship and praise him
[1:22:55] Hallelujah
[1:22:58] amen see they didn't like that going on
[1:23:00] see now where Jesus is always normally a
[1:23:04] lot of noise
[1:23:05] then Jesus came and called
[1:23:08] you know because when God comes on the
[1:23:10] scene how could it not bring forth a
[1:23:11] praise how can it not bring forth a
[1:23:14] heartfelt religion right but now if
[1:23:16] people just join in because others are
[1:23:18] doing it that's a form to them see it's
[1:23:20] got to be an individual on the heart to
[1:23:23] God praising the Lord I'm just repeating
[1:23:26] this because you know we don't want to
[1:23:28] get formal in any way
[1:23:30] Hallelujah we always want to have a
[1:23:32] heartfelt remember but the devil doesn't
[1:23:34] want us to have a heartfelt religion he
[1:23:36] wants us to be bound
[1:23:38] by by pain or misunderstandings or hurt
[1:23:43] you know or or are falling out with a
[1:23:46] brother or a sister or hard times in the
[1:23:48] fact you know we are always going to
[1:23:49] have hard times
[1:23:51] right but remember I come to church to
[1:23:55] worship God I don't come to church to
[1:23:57] worship my hard times right I don't give
[1:23:59] my hard times place
[1:24:01] we should we should come to church to
[1:24:03] worship God not our hard week or a hard
[1:24:06] month or whatever's going on no no our
[1:24:08] worship should be dictated to by our
[1:24:11] revelation of what he's done right sir
[1:24:14] so so if you're feeling like you've
[1:24:15] cooled off go back to what he did for
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:18] go back into your testimony and they're
[1:24:21] going to draw out those memories you
[1:24:23] know like you go look at photos or
[1:24:24] videos from holidays and stuff and then
[1:24:26] it brings you back into that place
[1:24:27] brings you back that feeling and the you
[1:24:29] know the atmosphere and you know you
[1:24:31] know the emotion that's why it's so
[1:24:33] important take your testimony out from
[1:24:35] the Shelf and bring it into the present
[1:24:37] day that's why God always reminded
[1:24:39] Israel remember what God remember what
[1:24:42] he did for you with Moses and Joshua and
[1:24:44] all the ones down Through the Ages he's
[1:24:45] the same God today and it should be the
[1:24:47] same thing with you and I remember where
[1:24:49] he found you remember where he found you
[1:24:53] the state you're in maybe the place
[1:24:55] you're living remember where he found
[1:24:57] you but remember when he found you he
[1:25:00] didn't leave you there
[1:25:01] he called you to himself
[1:25:04] you may be imbound by a lot of things
[1:25:06] maybe outwardly you look the part but
[1:25:09] inwardly you are not the part you're
[1:25:11] just the form but when the Lord saw you
[1:25:13] he said I don't want to leave you like
[1:25:15] that that is not your inheritance I did
[1:25:17] not die on Calvary if you just to have a
[1:25:19] form I'd Die that you would have me in
[1:25:21] reality and then he came your way maybe
[1:25:24] you're in church maybe wherever you were
[1:25:26] but he found you there he was looking he
[1:25:28] knew that that woman was in that
[1:25:30] synagogue
[1:25:31] just like in you with a woman at the
[1:25:32] well was he knew and he knew where you
[1:25:34] were he knew where I was and then he
[1:25:37] came your way Hallelujah he came your
[1:25:39] way and he touched your life you
[1:25:41] couldn't Lose Yourself no doubt that
[1:25:43] woman would have been for that 18 years
[1:25:45] so you know tried to push yourself up
[1:25:47] try and move again but that Spirit kept
[1:25:49] her bound down she made me cry at saying
[1:25:51] Lord why has this happened to me but in
[1:25:54] God's season he came her away because
[1:25:57] that did not stop her being a believer
[1:25:59] that did not stop her being a Christian
[1:26:01] that did not stop her coming to church
[1:26:03] she went anyway what a testimony that's
[1:26:06] powerful to me someone who's so bound up
[1:26:08] they can barely walk but yet they come
[1:26:09] anyway Hallelujah so then the Lord came
[1:26:12] and loosed to Hallelujah but yeah you
[1:26:15] need to we need to go back into our
[1:26:17] testimony because remember the devil
[1:26:19] doesn't want us to be in our first love
[1:26:20] I pray this is the year of our first
[1:26:22] love
[1:26:24] 2023 is the year of our first love I
[1:26:27] remember where it just gets greater and
[1:26:29] greater and more Hallelujah where he
[1:26:32] means more to us than than our entire
[1:26:35] life combined amen hallelujah because if
[1:26:37] he means less to us then we're in danger
[1:26:39] of going into a lukewarm condition and
[1:26:42] we remember the world is lukewarm but
[1:26:44] that spur can come unto us you know it's
[1:26:46] interesting when you go into Nations you
[1:26:48] actually see the national Spirit working
[1:26:50] you know like sadly in South Africa
[1:26:52] there's this old division
[1:26:54] racial division whatever it's all you
[1:26:57] can see it but in New Zealand it's all
[1:26:58] Easy Come Easy Go she'll be right no
[1:27:03] worries you know that's just kind of
[1:27:05] it's It's a lukewarm Spirit I'm glad I'm
[1:27:07] getting some nods because it's true
[1:27:09] right so we must be very careful that
[1:27:11] that Spirit doesn't influence our walk
[1:27:13] with God right because we are not easy
[1:27:16] come Jesus Jesus wasn't an easy cut I'll
[1:27:19] just easily go to the cross and then I
[1:27:21] go here and then that's if I go down to
[1:27:23] Hell and now I'm up in the resurrect no
[1:27:25] he it was it was it was a it was an
[1:27:28] incredible thing he went through it
[1:27:31] wasn't an easy come easy go he says for
[1:27:32] this course I've come into the world
[1:27:34] remember he was led by vision
[1:27:36] he says that he I see the father do that
[1:27:39] the son doeth likewise right so he saw
[1:27:41] by Vision what he had to do so so when
[1:27:43] he saw by when he's knew what he had to
[1:27:46] accomplish on Calvary and what he and
[1:27:48] the beatings he had to take in part of
[1:27:49] the Judgment Hall he saw that by vision
[1:27:52] and then he willingly walked into that
[1:27:55] vision
[1:27:58] he saw it
[1:28:00] and it wasn't easy come easy go
[1:28:03] it's like father if you'd be willing
[1:28:05] take this cup from me he he he wrestled
[1:28:08] wrestled it out in Gethsemane
[1:28:11] and there was a heaven was waiting for
[1:28:13] an answer will he say yes
[1:28:15] will he do it Hallelujah my life was at
[1:28:19] stake there I trust you you could
[1:28:22] recognize that too my eternal
[1:28:23] destination was at stake in that moment
[1:28:26] and then he says father
[1:28:28] not but not my will thy will be done and
[1:28:31] the yes goes back up to heaven
[1:28:34] because remember he had to choose God
[1:28:35] doesn't Force us to do anything
[1:28:37] he did not chew he did not force his son
[1:28:40] to do anything
[1:28:42] he had to willingly give his life
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:47] so we should not just be an easy come
[1:28:49] easy go kind of believer no the violent
[1:28:52] take the kingdom by force
[1:28:55] it's going to take actually a real
[1:28:58] selling out
[1:28:59] and a real dedication and a real
[1:29:02] surrender a real consecration see if you
[1:29:04] really surrender to the Lord then the
[1:29:06] law can work through you it's not a
[1:29:08] physical violence that you and your
[1:29:10] human ability that could do it no it's
[1:29:12] in a fully surrendered life amen
[1:29:14] hallelujah Lord praise the Lord that's
[1:29:17] right
[1:29:18] that's right amen hallelujah so now
[1:29:22] our God is a god of power
[1:29:25] he's not a god of ritual
[1:29:27] he's not some formal theology
[1:29:30] see he says in the great coming revival
[1:29:33] outpouring the Holy Ghost so yeah I'll
[1:29:34] be I'll be done soon he says their
[1:29:36] Messiah was a god of power not some
[1:29:39] formal theology their God is a god of
[1:29:41] power he's the one that could can
[1:29:44] perform Miracles he's the one who knows
[1:29:46] the secrets of the hearts of the people
[1:29:47] he stands as Jehovah that's right Jesus
[1:29:49] Christ Jehovah May Flesh on Earth has
[1:29:52] raised from the dead and living among
[1:29:53] the people today and the Gentile days is
[1:29:56] finishing so he is not some formal
[1:29:58] theology now if this message is ever
[1:30:02] diminished to an argument then we are
[1:30:04] defeated
[1:30:05] when the when the Devil comes and
[1:30:08] diminishes the message the Bible to just
[1:30:11] an argument that person has been
[1:30:13] defeated
[1:30:14] because this is not an argument
[1:30:17] right it's not an argument it's not a
[1:30:19] list of doctrines it's not some
[1:30:21] persuasion or whatever no no the message
[1:30:23] is a res is the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:30:25] Christ that's what the message is and
[1:30:28] and and and if we have true Doctrine
[1:30:30] then it will be accompanied by the power
[1:30:33] of the Holy Ghost because it says in
[1:30:35] Luke 4 and 32 and they are astonished at
[1:30:37] his Doctrine for his words was worth
[1:30:39] power
[1:30:40] hey man so this message should never
[1:30:43] become an argument he is the
[1:30:45] resurrection and the life Hallelujah but
[1:30:47] the devil wants it to diminish into an
[1:30:49] argument why because then we just begin
[1:30:51] to adopt a form
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:55] but praise God we don't have to stay as
[1:30:57] a form
[1:30:58] amen but he's here this morning Amen to
[1:31:01] loose us that we can walk with a real
[1:31:03] heartfelt walk with God
[1:31:06] you say this is all very Elementary no
[1:31:08] we've got to have a first love love is a
[1:31:11] Feeling is right I can't say I love my
[1:31:14] wife and have no feeling
[1:31:16] that's right no that that's a fake but
[1:31:18] if I really love her I'll have an
[1:31:19] emotion they'll be you know because
[1:31:21] people say well the word comes into your
[1:31:23] soul there's no feeling in the soul and
[1:31:24] you know no hold on but love has an
[1:31:27] emotion with it
[1:31:28] right we're not a bunch of robots that
[1:31:30] don't feel anything because that's just
[1:31:32] a spirit realm and no we are human
[1:31:34] beings
[1:31:36] oh here okay we've got one we've got a
[1:31:38] human being here okay we've got a few
[1:31:40] more so we have emotion we have feelings
[1:31:42] right Hallelujah but so our our religion
[1:31:45] our walk with God must be a heartfelt
[1:31:47] one because that way he can mold us and
[1:31:50] shape us that that our walk doesn't
[1:31:53] become formal and indifferent
[1:31:56] yes Hallelujah
[1:31:57] see many people throw away a lot of
[1:31:59] things that God can do because of what
[1:32:01] others have done with it
[1:32:02] but it's amazing you know you take the
[1:32:04] you take the restoration of the Bright
[1:32:07] Tree you take the restoration of the
[1:32:08] church you know we love justification
[1:32:11] don't we to be justified by faith who
[1:32:14] believes is justified by fight
[1:32:16] amen all right see but then if we look
[1:32:19] at Martin Luther's life he was a
[1:32:21] trinitarian he you know he was a beer
[1:32:24] drinking pipe smoking trinitarian that
[1:32:25] hated the juice
[1:32:27] we don't throw away justification just
[1:32:30] because he did that but it was the truth
[1:32:32] being restored there's a lot of error
[1:32:33] but there's the truth we take that part
[1:32:35] of the truth don't we right now Wesley
[1:32:38] believed in sanctification who believes
[1:32:40] in sanctum you know a holy life
[1:32:42] who believes in that right now but
[1:32:45] Wesley we know had a method of
[1:32:47] sanctification a human method that's why
[1:32:49] they're called methodists but a true
[1:32:51] sanctification is actually the power of
[1:32:54] the blood comes into us and sanctifies
[1:32:56] our life from all unclean things right
[1:32:58] but then Wesley you know didn't didn't
[1:33:00] baptize correctly had all kinds of wrong
[1:33:02] things but we don't throw away
[1:33:04] sanctification just because he taught
[1:33:06] Samira because remember truth was being
[1:33:07] restored no
[1:33:10] amen anyone loves that kind of thing but
[1:33:12] the question is then why do we throw
[1:33:14] away the power of Pentecost
[1:33:16] just because of what the Pentecostals
[1:33:18] have done
[1:33:20] see why do we throw it away see people
[1:33:22] will throw away the gifts the moving of
[1:33:24] the spirit because well the Pentecostals
[1:33:26] went to seed on that look what they'd
[1:33:27] done look at what they do but why do we
[1:33:30] throw that away when that was a
[1:33:32] restoration of the gifts that was a work
[1:33:34] of God bringing restoring back his word
[1:33:39] see so we shouldn't see if we throw
[1:33:41] something away because of what someone
[1:33:42] else has done it can just become a form
[1:33:46] hey man it does see in my opinion man
[1:33:49] I'm very simple I don't it doesn't
[1:33:51] matter what other people have done with
[1:33:53] this they'll be accountable but it's for
[1:33:55] me
[1:33:56] hey man right yeah Joshua and Caleb did
[1:33:58] not throw away the promised land because
[1:34:00] of what Cora and Nathan did or anyone
[1:34:01] else no they said the promises for me
[1:34:03] that should be the same thing it may not
[1:34:04] be for someone else but it's for me I
[1:34:06] mean to everything that is of god is for
[1:34:09] me amen justification is for me
[1:34:11] sanctification is for me the gifts of
[1:34:14] the Holy Ghost as for me if God wants me
[1:34:16] to speak in tongues it's for me if he
[1:34:18] wants me to prophesy it's for me if he
[1:34:19] wants me to dance in the spirit it's for
[1:34:21] me whatever he has I want I don't just
[1:34:24] want part of him I want the whole word I
[1:34:27] want all nine spiritual gifts manifested
[1:34:29] in the local body that's what I want to
[1:34:30] see Hallelujah I want to see the spirit
[1:34:33] of God move I want to see a heartfelt
[1:34:35] religion on everyone's face amen why
[1:34:38] because it's for me Hallelujah that's
[1:34:41] how we want to be amen so thank God now
[1:34:44] Hallelujah though we live in a time of
[1:34:46] great indifference
[1:34:48] and great argument and great fussing and
[1:34:51] great coldness and people saying they
[1:34:54] have need of nothing in other words they
[1:34:55] don't need the Lord yet we can stand in
[1:34:58] this darkest of Ages you know I was
[1:34:59] thinking of maybe I'll preach at another
[1:35:01] time where it's incredible well where
[1:35:03] where we Rejoice being freed from the
[1:35:06] world from drugs or alcohol pornography
[1:35:09] whatever in the world lust whatever more
[1:35:11] but to me a greater Miracle is to be
[1:35:13] freed from a lukewarm spirit
[1:35:16] to me that's a powerful thing because
[1:35:17] someone who's lukewarm can look so right
[1:35:19] but they can be so wrong it can be so
[1:35:21] deceptive amen so that we can Rejoice if
[1:35:24] we're being freed from that lukewarm
[1:35:26] Spirit of formality where where our
[1:35:29] hearts hunted anymore but the Lord
[1:35:31] restores us back
[1:35:32] we can rejoice in that Hallelujah so I'm
[1:35:36] gonna I'm Gonna Leave It
[1:35:38] just there
[1:35:40] but I pray this year
[1:35:42] would be a year of our first love
[1:35:45] right and I believe the Lord wants us to
[1:35:48] give us a closer walk with him than ever
[1:35:50] before
[1:35:51] Hallelujah you say well I just seem to
[1:35:54] have a form you don't have to have a
[1:35:56] form
[1:35:57] he wants to walk with you more than you
[1:35:58] want him he waited all thousands of
[1:36:01] years for you to be born
[1:36:02] he rejoiced when you came to the Earth
[1:36:04] he rejoiced that day when he had it on
[1:36:06] his calendar the countdown I'm gonna
[1:36:09] meet them amen I'm going to meet them
[1:36:11] they get so excited
[1:36:13] you yo Adam Adam was sad because he was
[1:36:16] alone but he was manifesting God's
[1:36:18] loneliness he it's not good that God's
[1:36:21] alone say he thought of you and he put
[1:36:24] you upon the Earth and he put a date in
[1:36:26] the calendar at this time in this place
[1:36:28] they may not expect me but I've been
[1:36:30] expecting them
[1:36:31] and he came and found you that he would
[1:36:34] walk with you and know you and the power
[1:36:36] of his resurrection and he would be with
[1:36:38] you and your sufferings and your pain
[1:36:39] and your hurts and your glory and your
[1:36:41] rejoicing he's been looking forward to
[1:36:43] this day so I pray o God that this would
[1:36:46] be a day a year of our first love that
[1:36:48] whatever happens has happened in the
[1:36:50] past let's just put it under the blood
[1:36:52] let's not let us hold us back anymore
[1:36:55] let's press the mark of the high calling
[1:36:57] in Christ whatever's happened has
[1:36:59] happened we can't change last year we
[1:37:01] can't change whenever our birth or our
[1:37:04] family or whatever upbringing we can't
[1:37:06] change that
[1:37:07] but we can let him change us and our
[1:37:10] future
