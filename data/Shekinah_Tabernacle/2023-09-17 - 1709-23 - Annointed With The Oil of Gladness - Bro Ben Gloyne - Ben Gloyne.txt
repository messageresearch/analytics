set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac in Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old as God had commanded him and Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born under him and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear me will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck for I have borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great feast that same day that Isaac was win

begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship Him and of the angels He saith who maketh his angels um spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness in the scepter of thy kingdom I mean is the scepter of thy kingdom thou Hast loves righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even though God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows amens that's all I want to speak about this morning is the oil of gladness Amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer I

feel Glory as well we thank you Lord we commit the service into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to speak about the oil of glass Madness amen I'm so I'm so thankful that when the Apostle Paul was inspired to write about the anointing that was on our lord Jesus that he did not call it the oil of sorrow or the oil of formality or coldness or indifference but it's the oil of gladness amen and we can see that the uh he's speaking of the Holy Ghost that was upon him and this oil as you know this this anointing oil as you see this he was anointed above his fellows and we know that the fullness of all that God was was poured into Christ amen that so this anointing was poured out during you know just in portion into the prophets down through the Old Testament but when our lord Jesus our God became flesh it was a fullness amen of this oil and it's gladness and I I pray we get happy this morning amen when we when we realize that and and our gladness should be more than just an emotion the emotion goes with it but if we realize that the same anointing that was on our God is now within us amen that this gladness amen would would manifest in our lives now I read there about Sarah as a bit of a context because Sarah would come to a place in her life where her laughter turned from her laughter from unbelief and resentment and frustration to a laughter of Joy amen because the word had been fulfilled in her life that it was no longer it was no longer a a cycle of many years 25 years of a unfulfilled promise in our life that you know she no doubt got very frustrated Abraham didn't get frustrated because it was real to him it was revealed to him he was going to have Isaac so you know time did not frustrate him but he just got stronger in faith as it became more impossible but because it wasn't real to Sarah it became frustrating and we know that you know someone who can have such a revelation can be rejoicing overcoming that could actually cause a frustration in someone who is not in that same kind of position but I'm so thankful that we can walk with God that God that same atmosphere can meet one another amen that Sarah because Abraham knew that she was part of the promise and he kept praying and loving the Lord and walking with them knowing that in God's season God would meet Sarah amen so so finally there came a visitation in Genesis 18 I don't have it on my slides but we know it very well where God put on flesh amen and two angels also went and visited Sarah at Abraham and it was Abraham it wasn't Abraham's visitation it was Sarah's visitation because God would say according to time of life you're going to have the promised son and time of life speaks to a woman and not of a man so there there was God speaking to Abraham but it was it was Sarah's visitation but because the promise wasn't made real to her yet amen she laughed within herself saying this can't happen can I have pleasure with my Lord I'm old he's old you know this is impossible but in God God revealed that that that that that that that that was what she was thinking in her heart so if I stutter and splatter we'll get there eventually okay you know it'll come out okay you know so you know so so that was that was her visitation and that was God coming to her to turn her heart from unbelief and doubt to Faith I mean because we know that faith comes from God Amen you got to be anointed to believe amen and it's this anointing of gladness Amen that brings Faith Hallelujah so so I believe when she had that visitation when God spoke to her to say no you will have the son amen say it was a manifestation of Elohim that caused her heart to turn from doubt to Faith in the promise and we've had that same visitation in this this day where God has put on flesh and a prophet amen God reveal himself through brother Branham to turn the church's heart from from unbelief in the promise to Faith in the promise to give her strength amen that she can manifest the promised word of this season which is the change of the body that we will receive the promised out in the meeting in the End Amen so her heart so so her laughter was doubt amen her laughter was frustration at the promise of God but after that visitation she said laugh with me Hallelujah my heart has turned to laughter amen because why she's now rejoicing and the promise amen that God had given her had become manifested in her life so to me she received the oil of gladness Amen because he says here now that God has made me to love and that wasn't a laughter promise in doubt and unbelief but that was laughter and Faith saying Thank You Lord here's the promise I mean thank you Lord you turned my heart that I was resisting the promise I was angry I was you know we get to Stage our life we just get frustrated I mean we see a promise in the word we see the Promise and we've seen it happen many times you hear it on tape but then you just get so frustrated again you can't get to that spot and Sarah was frustrated here's Abraham rejoicing and having a good old maybe around the campfire get up and do a dance around the campfire praising God Amen and she's sitting there saying there he goes again that old you know but then it came her term I mean it wasn't just him dancing around the campfire saying glory to God she joined in the dance amen because the same Revelation that was upon him was now on her amen and it brought forth the promised son anyway so I pray that amen God pour out your all of gladness this morning amen that we'd see the promises there are a lot of today for us amen will be fulfilled Hallelujah did that become such a revelation we'd walk by that Revelation like never before I mean so he was anointed with this oil of gladness above his fellows now this word gladness as an exaltation specifically I welcome a gladness is an exceeding Joy amen an exaltation if that's how you say that word from the Oxford languages dictionary it's so it's a noun it's a feeling of triumphant Elation or Jubilation into rejoicing so it's not a feeling of defeat it's not a feeling of lukewarmness it's not a feeling of indifference you know it's a feeling of triumphant elation Hallelujah because you see when you get anointed you begin to see the victory the Lord has won for us the same way he sees it amen when we see that he he looks at Calvary as a finished work and he openly triumphed over every Spirit of hell he conquered hell itself every devil he conquered everything that could be conquered that day he conquered it and he Transit he conquered over it amen now he's here to manifest that victory in our lives amen so so he rejoices in the work of his hands amen he rejoices in the work of his hands and we are the work of his hands amen so Hallelujah it brings a feeling of trough now now I just want to say now this is more than just when I say a feeling it's more than just a feeling right because feelings come and feelings go one day you can feel like Satan Ray I'm gonna throw you until you learn from limb the next day I say Lord help me deliver me from this affliction but feelings come and go so but so so when I use the word feeling please take it Beyond a feeling to a revelation in the heart right that that that's Rock Solid that cannot move in spite of whatever's going on in your emotional realm there's a rock in your soul of Triumph I mean so so if so I trust that let's just put that glossary term out there so you don't get so you don't misunderstand me that well we're just going by feelings now because we know we won't the day of the Rapture some of us will be happy some of us will be sad some of us will be troubled but that's emotion that doesn't change the fact that we're on our way to heaven shouting Victory okay so so don't get in your mind that we have to be in a state of Nirvana of a a triumphal feeling in our spirits and then we're Rapture Ready okay because remember in the season the Resurrection the two on the way to emmaused our downcast their world had fallen apart everything had everything had crumbled around them and they're going back to their Village and they're living in the season of the resurrection and Jesus walks with them opens the scripture to them until they see him and that they realize they're part of his resurrection amen and this is the same thing that's happened in this day as God is Walking With Us opening his word to us to reveal to us we're part of this Rapture amen season Hallelujah the change of these bodies amen the resurrection amen of the of the Dead Saints and the translation of the living Hallelujah I mean let's read here in Psalms 47 and to the chief musician Assam for the sons of Korah oh clap your hands all ye people shout unto the god shout unto God with the voice of Triumph Hallelujah for for the Lord most high is terrible he's a great king over all the Earth he shall subdue the people under us and the Nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us the Excellency of Jacob whom he loves Selah God is God has gone up with a shout the Lord with the shout of a trumpet sing praises to God sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises for God is the king of all the Earth sing he Praises with understanding God reigneth over the Heathen God sitteth upon the throne of his Holiness the princes of the people Shall Gather together even the people um of the god of Abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto God he is greatly exalted Amy so we sing on clappy hands all ye people shout unto the Lord with the voice of Triumph I mean when we sing unto the Lord which is such a voice of Triumph in our voices amen Lord You've conquered all things amen you're the mighty conqueror amen and we are part of you amen but you see now as Sarah was waiting for the promise amen for for that visitation and as the church has been waiting for seven Church ages for that same visitation but now we can say truly we can laugh amen because remember remember God has the last love and it's actually upon the Earth the bride has the last laugh it's not the devil has the last laugh the final say no God has the final say so the devil may be laughing thinking he's got this whole world sewn up no no it ain't over it ain't over till the Bell until the buzzer goes amen and we have the last laugh amen it's not us CeCe let us let us turn our sorrow into Joy this morning let us turn our anguish in our frustration of trouble into Thanksgiving amen because our God is a great God Amen and we all have received if you have the baptism the Holy Ghost you've received the oil of gladness I mean this is what you have already so I'm not telling you something that one day you shall have no if you know him you have the oil of gladness because he is the oil of gladness Hallelujah so let that gladness come forth amen hallelujah amen let's read another one Psalms here 92 1-5 it says uh Assam or song for the Sabbath day now we are in the Sabbath day because the Sabbath day the true Sabbath day is being when you're birthed in the Kingdom you've received the Holy Ghost you've entered into an eternal rest I mean it's not keeping a day that was a shadow but the reality is when you receive the Holy Ghost so this is a song for you and I every day because we're in the Sabbath every day amen I'm resting amen I'm resting humanly from my own works now God is living as the Apostle Paul would say it's no longer either liveth a Christ that liveth in me he knew what the Sabbath was amen amen it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto his name almost high to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the upholstery upon the heart with the solemn sound for thou Lord hath made me glad through thy Work Hallelujah I will work I will Triumph in the work of thy hands amen who feels that way amen will we you know Lord you have made me glad through thy Work what we were we're not amen we're a sinner lost in the world full of unbelief and trouble but now we've met god with new creatures in Christ Jesus amen how can that not make you glad amen when you look at what you were and see what you are now you know what you were that's a good thing amen I believe we've all advanced towards the kingdom further we've all become more like him amen that should make us glad Hallelujah all right man I'm so you know it's so amazing when you see this Triumph through the scripture you know our God has never been defeated amen he's never retreated amen he's never backed up he's never thought I don't have enough to win the day no he's always had more than enough amen he had more than enough an Enoch's day for Enoch to walk with God you know many times we think of Enoch I just think of him as like all I have a picture in my mind is Enoch walk in this green grassy meadow the birds are chirping the sun's are shining no trouble he had a lot he had trouble in his life because he was he was the Shadow and we're the reality there were things going on in the world there was trouble going on in every hand but yet he chose to walk with God he didn't walk with the trouble he didn't walk with the problems he walked with God Amen so so this is yeah but so so God nothing could stop Enoch taking that walk God ordained that walk and Enoch took that walk amen so every day is Walking with God and then one day he got so far home yo yo he said well I've got to make my way back now home God and God says no no just keep walking with me and he walked all the way home with God hallelu instead of his natural home he went to his Heavenly home and I believe it's the same thing with you on I let's just keep walking we're an idea with the oil of gladness today amen we're not defeated amen we may be down we may be done because he may be troubling every hand but we are not defeated amen we are not Cars we're not forsaken we're not a forsaken people nowhere loved people we're an Embrace people amen we're an accepted people only we're accepted in the Beloved amen because of what he has done not because of what we could do what he has done that matters it will stand for eternity Hallelujah so that should give us such a Thanksgiving and a hearts Lord you found us on God you're keeping us in this Dark Age you will date in the world walk with you like Enoch walked Hallelujah so we just have an Enoch walk every day of our life hallelujah amen because God has given us the oil I'm gladness I mean your sins were as dark as the greatest Scarlet down there white as snow amen all those things I remember no more now walk with me Hallelujah Hallelujah amen we're not Anointed with the we're not Anointed with escepticism when I Anointed with a down you know some people think it's it's spiritual to be down and contrived and well here I am no that's not the oil of gladness that's the devil trying to push you down in a pit somewhere amen don't sympathize with the Devil is like I just continue from Wednesday the devil wants you to sympathize with them if you sympathize with that Spirit you open the door and you be and that Spirit comes on you so don't listen to No spread of this country to the word of God doesn't matter if it's family parents whatever it is don't listen to it disregard it that don't mean you don't like that person or love them no more but you can't help them by sympathizing with them you say well you don't understand what we're going through Jesus knows exactly what you're going through amen he conquered every spirit that can be conquered he knows exactly what we're going through amen he can relate to you because he's been there so never think no one understands amen maybe no one understands here but he does but he wants your his oil of gladness to come upon your life amen and then that will set you free and break the bands of the enemy Hallelujah hey man that's all we need just just sympathize with the Lord he wants you to agree with his word amen he wants you to say yes Lord Hallelujah see it doesn't matter what state we're in Gideon was a mighty man availability stretching weed in secret but God wanted him to agree that's why the angel came to and said you're a mighty man just agree with what I'm telling you you are doesn't matter what you feel you are this is what I say you are Hallelujah and that's what matters it doesn't matter what you think you are it's what he says you are that stands forever Hallelujah why because he's trying to get you to see how he saw you when he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and if you can just agree with that image amen you'll have a voice of Triumph irrespective of what's going on in your life hey man that's why Sarah could now laugh because she saw herself as God saw her amen she was a princess with God that's why her name was changed amen you're a princess with God we're royalty this morning amen doesn't matter what we are how much money what money that doesn't care about nothing no we are made in God's image Hallelujah that's your girl such an oil of gladness Amen I know I know who I am Hallelujah I mean the Apostle Paul was anointed before with a with a Scully intellectual kind of Darkness but then the oil of gladness found him on the road to Damascus Hallelujah Hallelujah amen he says now thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ before they'd say my Pharisee Doctrine makes me Triumph those things don't help no one amen but if you're in Christ you all he always causes us to Triumph I mean he will not put his name to shame Hallelujah he always uphold his children Hallelujah and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place for we are unto God a sweet savior of Christ in them that are saved and in them that and in them that perish amen that sweet savior is a nice odor like in the Old Testament I think I said a few Sundays ago God likes food God like you know like nice Aromas yellow incense and things and you know but that's just a shadow now here's the reality it's a surrendered life it's a lover a life that loves God that's Anointed with the oil of gladness that brings up a sweet scent before the Lord he looks downstairs I enjoy that worship and that's this and that's not just singing in church that's just an everyday kind of a life I mean your life is offering a sweet smelling savior before the Lord hallelujah and you're glad he's made us a Living Sacrifice I mean he looks down and says well there's a lot of Darkness but actually I see a lot of light I mean I see myself upon the Earth Hallelujah Hallelujah amen now as I said the oil of gladness this is what the Lord was anointed above his fellows the fullness of the god here bodily dwelt on me did not have this anointing by measure but it was without measure but we understand that that our Lord hears he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief now because many times you may think well how can you have the oil of gladness does that not mean you should always be happy as I'm saying it's above feelings it's greater than feelings I always say it's deeper than feelings now we're going there it's deeper right because it's in the soul it's more than just in your spirit realm even though it comes forth right you begin to feel glad but it's not a euphoric feeling we must have all the time that means we are ready okay because you see it says he's he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief if you're acquainted with something you know you begin to know that real well right so and we head as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows that yet we did a steam him stricken smitten of God and afflicted so he was so he had a hard life physically yeah he didn't have a place to lay his head he had a lot of trouble there's people pulling him you know he wanted to be killed he knew exactly what he wasn't shocked when the scribes and Pharisees you know came to get him he wasn't shocked that Judas betrayed him he knew all those things would happen so but yet he had this oil of gladness above any other Prophet amen his anointed because he could look because of this oil of gladness he could look beyond the Here and Now by me you know as as Jesus would say here in Luke 10 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit amen now that rejoicing and spirit is true to have exceeding joy to jump for joy Jesus jumped Jesus ran Jesus danced he wasn't a formal kind of hippie kind of a God no he wasn't that kind of way at all he was a real happy guy I mean but so so because and the reason he rejoiced in spirit he said I thank the O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth for thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so farther so it seemeth good in my sight all things are delivered unto me I mean turn me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned uh he turned him unto his disciples and said privilege privilege blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desire have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them amen says rejoicing because he is saying Lord these things are hidden but they're revealed to a certain group of people I mean because there was a joy set before him which was us redeemed dancing around the throne amen so so his his Joy came from a more than a here and an hour he looked beyond the crowds and what was going on you know normally the No Doubt the disciples were there without you know you're fed the fourth hour or five thousand and whatever and multitudes are following him they thought man this is really gaining traction yeah but in God's mind it wasn't gaining traction you know and then he had to say that yeah you know certain things in John 6 unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you all those things you know because it wasn't numbers he was looking for he was looking for character he was looking for parts of himself and when he began to gather those ones that was his Joy that was his Joy can you imagine he's walking by the Sea of Galilee we just see fishermen he sing attributes he sing parts of himself that he saw before the foundation of the world Amen they're in a fallen State because they're not but but within them is an image that must come forth and that's why when he came into his ministry he came out of the Wilderness after the 14 day temptation all those things he says come follow me he began to gather his his jewels would make up his crown he was looking Beyond a ragged fisherman he saw an attribute he saw a part of himself amen that would have given him a great joy holy what was he doing he was on a treasure hunt Hallelujah he went to Samaria there was a great treasure in Samaria the the city didn't see it see her as a treasure but she was a great treasure in heaven because she had representation in heaven so he could have said to his disciples I have Nico the by the way it's America because I've got a great Jewel well should we go with you do we need an armed guard are we going to get robbed what's going no no that's greater than a diamond greater than gold greater than whatever's in the treasury in Rome or wherever this is a greater Jewel that's an eternal one amen so he went Gathering Jewels he revealed himself Holiness just something about this oil of gladness it finds it finds attributes of God it finds parts of itself that are in flesh amen that he goes to Legion he goes to different ones yeah I'm gonna cross the sea what where are we going Lord there's a jewel across to see it's buried under a lot of Darkness it's got a legion of demons guarding that Jewel see it don't matter the security the devil puts around a jewel of God it doesn't matter how much he thinks he's got that got that one bound down tied down hog-tied whatever more no when the treasure hunter comes when the Great Shepherd comes amen nothing can stop it hey man he just hit us sir simple phrase get out and they had to leave amen just under that Divine Authority just get out it wasn't a long prayer time get leave well can we go into the pig's shop they went to the pigs Hallelujah just like when he was in the Tomb how ridiculous the devil is they you think about caiaphasis you know he sees the guards he sees the tomb sealed the Roman Legions and they're on high alert because if that guy gets out they're dead you know if the disciples come along steal his body that's the end of their Quran they're not just fired they're executed and he and he would no doubt would have had such a smug look on his face the devil gets smug sometimes but it ain't over till it's over so you know that when the smug look on his face it's finally done we crucified the plan worked boys high fives first bumps whatever they did I don't know you know we got him he's there we've got these guards they can't get them out and spread alive that he's raised and the devil thinks he's got you yeah the devil thinks he can just let a Spirit come in get blinded under some entertainment or something of the world I've got them in a tomb oh no oh no why because that may be what Friday looks like when Sunday is coming amen that made me look like Friday it's all ruined it's all fallen to pieces it's all gone like there's no but Sunday's coming resurrection's coming Hallelujah it doesn't matter what someone's head and buried behind and sealed behind I mean there's no tomb that God can't bust through I mean there's no guards of Hell whatever unbelief skepticism whatever more God can bust through that thing and bring his Jewel out Hallelujah because he ain't leaving until they're all gathered Hallelujah he ain't leaving until they're all on Amen so hallelujah amen that was his joy and I tell you friends if that's our joy that's our joy Lord there's got to be a jewel here somewhere maybe here maybe here I don't know find may we find him Lord you see that light come that flame of the Holy Ghost get a hold of someone yeah that should be our greatest joy that was his greatest joy oh that should be our joy amen Hallelujah you see brother around makes a statement in the Mighty God unveiled before us he says now I mean a woman and delegates of this convention you're on a convention today hello how are we doing I want to say this without respect of persons but in in the view of today in the view of what um we're here for today I'm afraid that the traditions of the fathers and church fathers has hid this from too many people since the Holy Ghost has come in this last days as prophesied and the veil had been rent too many people try to hang to their traditions of the fathers that's why they can't see this extreme joy amen and peace and things that the church has today yet it's in plain view to those who believe amen so there's an extreme joy that we have today Hallelujah praise God how's your how's your yo your joy should be extreme remember it's deeper than your feelings okay and then we just keep that in mind I mean you can be feeling so indifferent down whatever more but yeah there's extreme joy but you see the veil of the traditions of the Fathers as the whole you know yes well the Lord's allowed us all my life to Humble me you know I've got the sword in My Flesh and just to keep me humble because of the abundance of Revelation that I have and you know yo I'm just you know the Lord's allowed Us in my life and that's a tradition of the fathers has God told you it's meant to be there don't just assume the devil's in your mind and mind bowels and trouble because God's trying to keep you humble no he wants you to have joy and peace he wants you see we don't have the spirit of fear but love power and a sound mind I mean a sound mind is one that there's not a constant torment in amen see sure we're not immune from mind battles but there should come a point where it's like okay Satan I'm sick of this I'm sick of this mind battle go talk to yourself devil you go look in the mirror and tell yourself these things I know you're a decrepit creature anyway but hey just just just go talk to yourself business hours are closed you know the amazing thing about a throne room this security and if the king don't like somebody they get kicked out they have no right the only way they can come in and do what they do and then leave is if they have greater power than the Gods see Moses Brotherhood said you know one soldier with a spare could end of the whole thing but he had the oil of gladness because God's people are coming out they've been in slavery 400 years but God's people are coming out do you think about him and Aaron now they walk into the throne room naturally you think who are these stinking Shepherds coming into this great big Palace and the gods could have said just get out you can't you're not welcome here maybe they you know like the movies they cross the across the spares over the doorway you know but they also because the anointing was there they had to give way they had to give entrance because the devil could not stop them coming in and delivering their message Amy it's the same thing with Elijah came before King Ahab do you think he was welcome there in Samaria they had already started to put the prophets of God to death and here comes one guy fuzzy face out of the Wilderness you know it won't be rain or due till I call for it one God with a sword could have ended the whole thing but no the but the greater one came into the throne room than a natural Throne Hallelujah says the same thing we've got to realize hey we've got security we don't have to put up the devil raging in our mind all the time no we can call security he can be evicted amen he can be evicted amen doesn't matter how real how verbalt it can be no it's just trying to get you to worship it amen so we don't sure we're not immune for them but we don't have to put up with them we had to put up with nonsense this is a no-nonsense kind of place I know about the devil's nonsense now all right we don't have to put up with that stuff amen so there's we have an extreme now please when you read this stuff the devil will probably say you've never had this feeling it's Greater Than A Feeling right it's greater than a feeling okay but you got to realize the mighty mighty God unavailable for us brother Brown's not just preaching about God veiled in him he says no he's valid in people I mean these son of man Luke 17 30 is veiled in is manifested in human beings Christ revealed in a multi-membered body now it was in it was in brother Brown's Ministry the son of man was revealed Jesus Christ but that revealing of the son of man continues on through the bride of Christ amen so the Mighty God is unveiled he's been unviable for us and you know when he's unveiled when you've stepped into his presence and he's changed your life that means there's no vowels of tradition of long faces long hair long skirts grumpiness buzzsaw kind of attitudes you know oh we've got to be Pious and got to be referent no I think we should get out of order long enough someone to get saved yeah where did you get out of order long enough that that actually demons flee that we can really Express see the biggest problem is when we suppress what's going on within us that's very unhealthy and that's the biggest problem in this country especially with men as we suppress how we feel oh boy it'll hold together don't worry and if not well hey there's some effects there I'm sure we can you know but that's the biggest problem in this country especially as men don't know how to express how they feel they bottle up things and it's manifested in violence or anger or withdrawment or whatever it is but you see you should never suppress so the devil's fighting you trying to suppress you no just say no I'm gonna I'm gonna expose you devil I'm gonna expose you before the world if I need to you're going to get exposed and you're gonna look like the silly fella yeah amen so we should never express these things I mean I mean suppress we should have seen that's why you know we're not meant to just be a Pious bunch of statues I'm not saying we are you know I know I'm preaching to the choir but you know we should but we should let our emotions come out it's healthy to let our emotions come out amen amen pardon me now all that Christ all that wasn't God excuse me oh was poured unto Christ amen and all that was in Christ was poured into the church amen so that oil of gladness is now in you and I remember this is not something that's this is this is today's news and and some of us a bit have have have been have had this oil of gladness for a long time some of us are short time it's all fine you've got it if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got it I mean so all that was in God was poured into Christ other than Christ was poured into the church now this baptism is the same one that we have received as as the sons of thunder would ask him their mother said you know granted that that my two sons can sit on your right and left hand and then they ask can you drink the cup that I'll drink and be baptized with the baptism that I'll be baptized with and they said we can and he said truly that is true you shall drink of the same cup and you'll be baptized with the same baptism so you will receive the same oil of gladness amenby says unto them about they said but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them which are uh for whom it is prepared of my father so so the people that will sit on us right and left hand is a predestinated place and it's for a certain people amen it's a people that have been prepared to sit there amen so prepared over so so now if we come down to this last day the promises down through the church ages the promise to this lettuce in church Jesus to them that overcometh will sit down on my Throne as I sat down on my father's Throne so now he's saying now the Overcomers of this age they will sit so so we are the sons of thunder wanted to sit was not for them because they're not on this age amen but it's for the bride in this last age it's been prepared for you and I amen so there's a place of position power and authority amen that we've already been seated in Heavenly places but this is the Overcomers Throne amen that we will sit in in the millennium Hallelujah so I trust no because you got to realize man what we were we're not I know I say it probably very very simply but we've risen above a lot of things hey we've risen above sin we've risen above skepticism we've risen about formality we're represent above all kinds of things of the world and God Has Lifted us higher and higher so what's happening we are overcoming God through us is overcoming these things so whatever sins we were in Once Upon a Time but we're no longer that person we've overcome this right well they've been conquered so now the reason we're on this trajectory to the Overcomers Throne is because we're Anointed with the Overcomer himself with there's an oil of gladness because you've got to see the anointing we've received takes us to a position right so now the world brother Ram said that these spirits of you know rock and roll in Hollywood thinks will take the world to Armageddon so the demon powers of the world will take the world to the battle of Armageddon right but we're not Anointed with the spirit of the world we're Anointed with the spirit of Christ so if we're Anointed with the spirit of Christ he dwells within us he's going to take us to the Overcomers Throne we're not going to Armageddon well actually we are going to Armageddon but not that way we're going to come with Christ on white horses come out of heaven in Revelations 19 and fight the battle of Armageddon right for that spread of rock and roll will take the world through that battle but on the wrong side are you following me praise the Lord so the anointing we receive will take us to a place now I'm saying these things I trust that makes you glad it doesn't make you unhappy Amy just like David when he was anointed to be king it took him to the throne it's the anointing that took him to the throne it wasn't himself that took him there it wasn't his own abilities how smart he was how clever he was as Charisma whatever abilities he had it was not those things that got him to be the king it was the anointing in his life that got into the throne amen it's the same thing with you and I it's the anointing of God this should make us this the soil of gladness why because the love affair amen we don't this is not a oil Affair or trepidation that's the oil of gladness why you love your bridegroom he means more to you than everything in the world you can take this whole world but give me Jesus holistic is a there's a pulling power see we're being pulled we're not being pushed or kick we're being pulled there's a drawing why because the anointing thing is drawing you into Heavenly places it's drawing you into a rapture that's what the third poll is amen it's a word that's come to change our bodies I know it's the power of the spoken word all those things but ultimately it gives us rapturing Faith through what these bodies have changed I trust this is not all hashtags and buzzwords but there's something uh real in here I mean but you see there's an anointing has come upon the Earth to bring us to our expected end which is the overcomer's throne Hallelujah so you see even though we're surrounded by many enemies now it's going to read this because I enjoy Psalms 23. it says yo that yea though walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil now this is not mind over matter just something in a Believer I have no fear I don't know what I'd feel like when I got to this point but I just have no fear you you can hear many testimonies of those who are on death's door who thought they were going to die no fear you can speak to Christine then Switzerland many years ago she'd had an overdose anaphylactic reaction to Tramadol found herself leaving her body and a an unbelieving auntie he's there by the bedside crying and she's saying I just wish I could tell her how great this is no fear why because she settled her account long ago at Calvary amen but you see there's many examples like that there's just no fear and humanly it seems very strange but but that oil of gladness just takes over like never before Hallelujah you see because you realize now it's like when death starts to strike the real you comes out in a greater measure so if you love them more if you love them now you just wait till these five senses leave and you realize actually you are you know it's like our brother and now the opposite of that is you know brother Ram said about that Sunday school teacher she was dying you know the class even came into the hospital room and then her brother said her her human Spirit was leaving her mental faculty were leaving and she realized her true state I'm lost cries out to her pastor you deceiver of man so she thought she was fine until that moment she realized she wasn't fine now you take that into the positive now you know how the devil fights us you're not a Christian you'll never overcome you're never gonna get there and then there's that moment with actually these human factors leave I have I'm more found than I realized I'm more secure than I've ever been about that Hallelujah I'm not a strong Foundation it's greater than I ever thought hallelujah amen oh my hallelujah hallelujah amen all the fears and flusterations leave we just oh I pray God would just do that to us just even now Hallelujah we have such a confidence in our God amen but thou Anointed with my head whether or no thou prepares the table for me in the presence of my enemies Amy what's wrong do devil when you come around now what what's what my guide will do to me devil when you come around I mean our anointed my head with oil my cup Runners over maybe it's not just a little thing and let's all be uh all dignified and not make any mess no rejoicing can get messy his name is sinful but it can get messy hallelujah amen thou anointed my head what worth with sadness sorrow pain sickness no with joy maybe which is beyond anything that's going on in our lives and my cup runneth over amen David under the blood of bulls and ghosts knew what I was like to get happy in the presence of God Amen I say how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ everywhere it's God's not just with them but in them Hallelujah Hallelujah you see now this oil of gladness makes us very bold when you get anointed you feel like you can take on anything yeah amen you see this here and we go with David David before the host of the Philistines and Goliath is I'm going to kill you all if I have to one Shepherd boss I'm gonna I'm gonna annihilate this whole Army he was anointed with the oil of gladness I mean that what what why is it an oil of gladness in that situation because you know your God can do anything against any enemy and you'll come out packing the victory Hallelujah so yo if you ever get fearful you say no that's not my anointing you get worried about what you say no that's not my anointing my anointing is an anointing of boldness and courage and a stability Hallelujah amen praise God now you know this this oil is unlimited the devil can't limit it God's poured it poured out all the I know what all the Vats of Heaven the whole thing who's ever like poured out a bucket or like a swimming pool or say it's just it just goes everywhere Hallelujah that's what God's done it's not just an anointing by measure even down through the church ages anointing by measure because that's that part of the word down through each age you're still the Holy Ghost working but now it's the full word has opened up because the seals reveal Christ Hallelujah so now the anointing that's on this ages without measure I like a lot of food I like a lot oh I bet praise God so that's without measure amen we have more than just what Luther had though we have what Luther had but plus right we have more than what Wesley had but we're well we're but we have what where's he about plus and the same with the Pentecost we have that plus because God's a god of addition amen but we because the full word has come open this anointing is not limited amen and the devil can't limit it Hallelujah even under the third seal if we can go there even under the third seal where there's the black horse rider hey man he's riding with those scales in his hand oh yeah a pair of balances in his hand but notice this voice that actually tells you tells him what he can and cannot do that's why I'm so thankful the devil's got to ask permission before he does anything he's got to ask permission from our God and God has the final yes or no the devil can't sing he's not the devil's not like a rebellious child that you tell them no and they just do the yes anyway no if it's a no it's a no and he can't make it a yes hallelujah our god has all control of everything amen so notice this voice from the midst of the 4B so this is the voice from the Throne of God itself this is a measure of wheat for a penny and three misses of barley for a pennies in other words you can you can control the bread of life in this way the staff of life you know natural things but see thou hurt not the oil in the wine so Satan you can control economics you can do all these different kind things but you cannot hurt the oil the anointing oil and stimulation by Revelation you cannot stop that Satan you cannot diminish it you cannot contain it you can't put a dam up and nowhere amen it's going to come through hallelujah it's on and especially in this stage age it is unlimited I mean we are living in the age of unlimited resources I mean we're living at the age of unlimited Revival Hallelujah this is the age we're living in right now amen so the oil cannot be stopped by Satan he can sure fight he fights I know he fights and tries to stop and get us distracted but he can't stop the flow of the anointing Hallelujah and he can't stop amen the the wine the stimulation of the Revelation amen amen he would love to stop it he would love to he would love to make us all formal lukewarm powerless and cold he would love this church to be that way he would love your life to be that way but God's saying you can't do that to them amen you can't do that to them no they have they have an open they have all access to all that I am all they ever will be all my promises all the anointing all the stimulation they want it's open season you can have it all you want I mean you can drink it till you can't drink no more than drink some more games I mean you can be anointed till you're swimming in it Hallelujah and just swim some more amen amen so the devil wants to try and stop it but he can't stop it hey man so he can't stop our dance he can't stop our praise he can't stop our Victory he can't stop our song he can't stop our joy amen he can't stop it hallelujah amen and if the devil tries to steal anything from you say Satan give that back that's mine Hallelujah I was enjoying that now give it back to me Hallelujah hey man see you feel down the devil's fight he say Satan get out of my way you're I'm dancing here before the Lord get out of my way I'm dancing and if he doesn't move just stand on him be like a tank running over a car it just gets mashed down while Satan you ain't moving I'm gonna start stomping holy you know what that's in the Book of Esther well the Jews now when they have the Feast of Purim they write they write Haman on the bottom of their shoe and they read the book of Esther and every time haman's name is red they start stomping and then by the end of the book they look at their souls of their feet and his name is no longer written anymore hallo and the bride is having a dance right now amen where weather hey hallelujah what yeah but now they're looking back with triumph over historical Victory amen but now we're living in a season of Victory amen shall we look back at Calvary say it was all down that down Calvary but the victory one there is being lived out through seven Church ages has been lived out in uni hello so we're reading the book oh my God we're reading the book amen and we think Satan under our feet and we're just enjoying it because they wait wait till we get to the next chapter can you imagine amen your old Jewish fella he would know the Book of Esther word for word it's not many chapters imagine the excitement in this the Feast of Purim there's chapter one but chapter two gets real good Hallelujah the excitement will begin to build and then chapter three Hallelujah The Stomping will probably get a lot more Hallelujah no that's just a historical book what about this well where are we we're in Revelation 10. Hallelujah wait till 19. Hallelujah wait till 21. hallelujah it's gonna be awesome and then and in our lives hallelujah amen our bodies will be changed hallelujah hallelujah and we'll look and say no he's not under there he's in that pit burning up foreign [Applause] hallelujah amen oh my I don't know where to go from here isn't that God great I think we can just Rejoice this morning I mean we've been Anointed with the oil of gladness Amen when you're down and discouraged to say Lord Pour it Again that's what happened in Acts chapter four amen when the Sanhedrin drag them and say Don't Preach in his name anymore try to intimidate them I said boys yeah let's go have a prayer meeting God's Gonna pour in his oil oil of gladness safe and that's why they stick around like drunk people in the book of Acts Acts chapter 2 where they receive the oil of gladness amen because I saw the word fulfilled the prophecy became flesh in them so it made them happy amen and when you can see the prophecy of the Bride I mean being fulfilled amen it should cause your cup to run over Hallelujah so so after they were they were threatened by the Sanhedrin they went and had a prayer meeting God just poured in more of the oil of gladness refilled them again they went out with boldness amen I will finish with this in here I mean there'll be a Time come forth when he would Express himself in the fullness of his God he deity through his church have the preeminence in in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people Hallelujah oh my to bring back the anointed bride in the bridegroom anointed by accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spreads he Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept it amen so he's bringing forth the anointed bride and the bridegroom yeah Hallelujah amen you know what you know what brother Brown's greatest achievement was it wasn't the meetings in Durban whether thirty thousand came to crisis Mass healings at Racecourse was filled with people and you know it wasn't there in Cape Town where Christy and I stood there outside the drill Hall where brother Brown preached there was thousands of people on the outside because they couldn't get in they had they had loudspeakers you know um linked to the service and there was a also well there was a young sister in there at the time she's old now not even a believer who said all we heard him say was good evening friends and then the anointing fell upon the crowd pandemonium broke out because it was just a mass healing it wasn't those things weren't his greatest achievement his greatest achievement was a bride being dressed in the word that he preached amen John would say he would Rejoice saying because he's saying he is the friend of the bridegroom his grace achievement wasn't calling the scribes and Pharisees a bunch of snakes it was introducing the lamb to the people Hallelujah what are we what is what is this word done to you let's introduce you here's the word he's introduced himself to you that's what this message is the bridegroom call there's been a call there's been a pull come unto me my children Hallelujah shouldn't they give us such a gladness this morning wouldn't that isn't that our greatest achievement that's why we have candidates while we have Services while we witness on the street is that someone would fall in love would have their down Calvary and fall in love with the Lord wouldn't that be our grass achievement amen hallelujah I mean let's stand this morning let's just finish there hallelujah oh my God amen glory to God amen our God is amazing Hallelujah Lord thank you for the oil of gladness our God Hallelujah let's have the musicians same in this morning hey man there
