[37:01] happy and well and amen the shock fact

[37:05] think everyone's scrambling in their
[37:06] mind to get a gift it's fine anyway I
[37:09] hope not hope you're prepared Matthew
[37:13] 14:24 uh but the here we are so but the
[37:17] ship was now in the midst of the sea
[37:19] tossed with waves for the wind was
[37:21] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[37:23] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[37:25] the sea and when the disciples saw saw
[37:27] him TR walking on the sea they were
[37:29] troubled saying it is a spirit and they
[37:32] cried out for fear but straight away
[37:34] Jesus spake unto them saying be of good
[37:36] cheer it is I Be not Afraid amen amen
[37:41] we're just going to read that portion of
[37:42] scripture this morning so if you have a
[37:44] need you want to slip your hand up to
[37:45] the Lord as we go to the Lord in prayer

[38:20] Thanksgiving and may we just appreciate

[38:26] always want to remember them in prayer
[38:28] be their portion too Lord wherever they
[38:30] may be we thank you for this day in
[38:31] Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you
[38:35] friends you can have your seats this
[38:36] morning so I want to speak about being
[38:37] being
[38:39] convinced being convinced this morning
[38:41] so uh so here as we look at this opening
[38:44] scripture they were you know there's you
[38:46] can be convinced by many things but when
[38:48] God convinces you that's different than
[38:50] a human convincing so they were at first
[38:53] convinced that Jesus was a spirit but
[38:55] then when Jesus spoke they were
[38:56] convinced that he was wasn't a spirit
[38:58] amen but that he was the uh he was the
[39:00] Lord Jesus that's why after this Peter
[39:02] says if it's you bid me to come walk on
[39:04] the water and Jesus says come so he
[39:06] walked on the water so he was convinced
[39:08] they were convinced that he was a spirit
[39:10] then they were convinced that he was
[39:12] Jesus right so this is where I'm going
[39:14] so now this this word convinced from
[39:16] Webster would tell us is to bring as by
[39:19] argument to belief consent or a course
[39:21] of action and another word that's close
[39:23] to it is to persuade so so B so this is
[39:26] um just some example convinced himself
[39:28] that she was all right and something I
[39:31] could never convince him to read so so
[39:33] in the dictionary a convincing is
[39:36] because of an argument or a list you
[39:37] know something that logically makes
[39:39] right but I want to say when God
[39:40] convinces someone convinces you or I
[39:44] it's not by a logical argument or
[39:46] reasoning it's by Revelation so I just
[39:48] want to just go into this today because
[39:50] I believe I'm looking at a people who
[39:52] are convinced I mean they're not
[39:54] mentally convinced I you I I Pray by the
[39:56] end of the service if you're just
[39:57] humanly convinced cuz Mom says it's good
[39:59] or dad says it's good or well it's nice
[40:02] to be here it goes beyond that
[40:04] convincing and it's god-given
[40:06] convin convincing conv you you just
[40:09] become convinced I'm like stay to make
[40:11] up words this is not working out very
[40:13] well but I pray you're convinced by the
[40:15] Holy Ghost amen that his word is true
[40:18] that it is right and our God is the same
[40:20] yesterday today and forever so now Jesus
[40:23] would ask his disciples in Matthew
[40:25] chapter 16 he would before he would say
[40:27] this uh but whom do you say that I am he
[40:29] would ask his ask them who do men say I
[40:32] am so he's basically asking what are
[40:34] they convinced about about what they see
[40:36] in my life what are they convinced about
[40:38] him and some say you're you know you're
[40:40] Elias or jeremias or one of the pro um
[40:43] you know one of the prophets so that's
[40:44] what that's what what they saw convinced
[40:46] them that he was a prophet raised from
[40:48] the dead but then Jesus asked him but
[40:50] who do you say that I am what are you
[40:52] convinced about here you know what does
[40:54] this what does this mean to you and
[40:56] Peter Simon Peter said um answered and
[40:58] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[41:00] Living God Amen and then so Jesus is
[41:02] going to tell him the source or the
[41:04] reason why he's convinced this way and
[41:06] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[41:08] art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and
[41:10] Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[41:12] my Father which is in heaven so the one
[41:15] who's convinced you Simon Peter is not
[41:17] you it's not the disciples it's not your
[41:20] culture it's not your background it's
[41:21] not it's not even you convincing
[41:23] yourself it's God in heaven has
[41:26] convinced you that I am the Messiah I am
[41:29] the Fulfillment of every prophecy that
[41:30] would be given of the Messiah I am he
[41:33] and then so and then so um Jesus would
[41:36] say and I say unto thee that thou art
[41:38] Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my
[41:41] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[41:42] Prevail against it because we got to
[41:44] realize that if you're convinced humanly
[41:47] then the Gates of Hell will prevail
[41:49] against that
[41:50] human argument yes I keep want to say
[41:53] convincing but I don't even know if that
[41:54] yeah yeah it's convincing that's a word
[41:56] a yeah there we go who did English here
[41:58] even yeah but you know if you're
[42:00] convinced humanly then a human can come
[42:02] and convince you out of it right but if
[42:03] God has convinced you then it's all over
[42:06] nothing can move you from that rock of
[42:08] Revelation amen now now Jesus would say
[42:11] this here because we got to realize that
[42:13] Jesus would give a parable and he'd
[42:15] speak about because um you know if
[42:17] someone is fully convinced they'll go
[42:19] all the way if people are just convinced
[42:22] humanly then they will the first sign of
[42:25] trouble or the first part of doubt would
[42:27] start to come in it will it will degrade
[42:29] that foundation and they'll begin to
[42:31] question what they're doing is right but
[42:33] if they're convinced they can see it's
[42:34] going to happen it's been revealed to
[42:36] them it's going to happen then nothing
[42:37] is going to stop them so he says here if
[42:40] any man come to and hate not his um
[42:42] father and mother and his wife and
[42:44] children and Brethren and sisters yay
[42:45] for his own life all and his own life
[42:47] also he cannot be my disciple now that
[42:50] word hate actually means to love less
[42:52] okay it doesn't mean we get all angry I
[42:54] hate you Mom and Dad I hate you siblings
[42:56] and no it's not what he meaning you you
[42:58] got to love your own self and all of
[43:00] your all of your um you know family you
[43:03] got to love everything less than him
[43:05] right because if you love yourself more
[43:06] you cannot be his disciple you cannot
[43:08] follow him but if you if you love him
[43:10] more than everything else then you can
[43:12] then you can be his disciple amen and
[43:15] whosoever do not bear his cross and come
[43:17] after me cannot be my disciple for which
[43:19] of you intending to build a tower sth
[43:21] not down first and cth the cost whether
[43:24] he have sufficient to finish it let
[43:27] happily after Heath laid the foundation
[43:29] is not able to finish it all that
[43:30] beholdeth it begin to mock him so
[43:33] someone who's just humanly convinced say
[43:35] yeah I can do that yeah that makes sense
[43:38] yeah this can all come into being and
[43:40] but then but then as time goes on then
[43:43] the proof of that conviction or that you
[43:45] know if they're really convinced by God
[43:46] or man will become to be a parent but if
[43:48] they're convinced that yes it's going to
[43:50] happen it's it's a revelation they say
[43:52] it's going to happen it comes into
[43:54] manifestation it's like Elijah was n
[43:57] humanly convinced I need to call Ahab
[43:59] and the prophets of Baal to mount carel
[44:01] you know let's just you I'm sick of this
[44:03] let's just end this he wasn't convinced
[44:04] by his own mind and his own righteous
[44:06] indignation no he was convinced by God
[44:09] call them to Mount Carmel do what I tell
[44:11] you to do he was convinced and when he
[44:13] was convinced all the noise the prophets
[44:15] of Baal all the hooa they did all the
[44:18] cutting themselves the dancing the music
[44:20] the whatever they did did not move him
[44:21] one bit am mean because he was convinced
[44:24] by God what God showed him was going to
[44:26] come into manifest
[44:27] amen and it should be the same thing
[44:29] with you and I friends we should be so
[44:30] convinced that this word is true amen we
[44:33] should be so convinced that Beyond
[44:35] trouble beyond all whatever is going on
[44:37] in life his word is true he's more than
[44:39] able to fulfill it amen we should be
[44:42] thoroughly convinced hallelujah
[44:45] hallelujah I trust I am I mean I mean I
[44:47] trust you are rather saying this man
[44:49] began to build and was not able to
[44:50] finish it or what king going to make war
[44:52] against another king sth not down first
[44:55] and consult whether he's able with with
[44:57] 10,000 to meet him that cometh against
[44:59] him with 20,000 or else while the others
[45:01] is um while the other is yet a great way
[45:03] off he sendeth a an ambassage and
[45:06] desireth conditions of Peace So likewise
[45:08] who whosoever he be of you that
[45:11] forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot
[45:14] be my
[45:16] disciple so we've got to consider these
[45:18] things that you know we can't just start
[45:21] saying yes it's mentally true no we're
[45:23] to be convinced by the holy ghost that
[45:25] he's more than able to fulfill his word
[45:28] I mean cuz you've got to see now
[45:30] that when when when man tries to fulfill
[45:33] the word in his own ability he's only
[45:37] convinced he can do it and that never
[45:40] comes to any anything
[45:42] good right now Moses Moses was convinced
[45:47] humanly that he was the deliverer right
[45:50] he he heard the supernatural testimony
[45:52] of his parents you know where Abraham
[45:54] was praying and you know brother BR
[45:55] would dramatize it how you know amram
[45:57] his father was so burdened you know they
[45:59] had to come the deliverer and he would
[46:00] he would be beaten and and everything in
[46:02] the fields working it'd come out at
[46:04] night go on the top of his Housetop and
[46:05] cry out to Jehovah God that you know
[46:07] calling on him when you know when are
[46:09] you going to send this promise this this
[46:11] promise deliverer that you told Abraham
[46:13] that we're going to come out of this
[46:15] place with a mighty hand and time is
[46:16] approaching and when's this going to
[46:17] happen and amram would I mean I mean
[46:19] joked his wife would tell him you know
[46:21] amran you don't have to pray someone
[46:23] else can pray but he was so burned he
[46:25] said but but but what if no one else
[46:26] does I got to pray through cuz God he
[46:28] was convinced that it was this the
[46:30] season of the Fulfillment of that
[46:32] prophecy he was convinced amen then by
[46:35] faith they realized when they had that
[46:37] when they had Moses he was the promised
[46:39] son Hallelujah so and we know the story
[46:42] Moses was put in that basket you know
[46:44] went down the Nile and came to came to
[46:47] um came to um what do you call it um
[46:49] Pharaoh's daughter's Palace and all
[46:50] those things was raised in the palace
[46:52] and you know so he so Moses was
[46:54] convinced that he was the deliver but
[46:57] just humanly you see so when someone is
[47:00] just humanly convinced they try with
[47:02] human ways to try and fulfill it now we
[47:06] read here that you know Moses he came to
[47:07] a point in his life where where um you
[47:10] know he came to look out upon the um you
[47:12] know people of Israel he saw a Egyptian
[47:15] slave master was beating one of his
[47:17] Hebrew brothers and he looked around no
[47:18] one was no one was around and he and he
[47:21] and he killed the Egyptian and hit him
[47:22] in the sand and then now the second day
[47:24] he went out and behold two men of the
[47:26] Hebrews strove to and he said to the one
[47:28] that did wrong wherefore smartest thou
[47:31] thy fellow now you got to think about
[47:32] this Moses was raised in Pharaoh's
[47:34] Palace he could have been the next
[47:35] Pharaoh so he knew all the Judgment he
[47:38] knew how to you know give judgment and
[47:39] all these different things so he thought
[47:41] humanly because he was convinced humanly
[47:43] I can do the job and so how he tried to
[47:45] do the job was trying because he thought
[47:47] in his mind if I Sidle this fight then
[47:50] they'll say this man is really really
[47:51] knows what he's on about then he'll then
[47:54] they'll get under his influence and then
[47:55] eventually all of is Isel will come
[47:57] under his influence and then he'll say
[47:59] look boys this is what we need to do
[48:00] let's rise up you I know where all the
[48:02] weapons are and then we can start a
[48:04] revolution and we will liberate
[48:05] ourselves from Egypt but what did it do
[48:08] it caused one dead
[48:11] Egyptian that what his him being
[48:13] convinced humanly that he could fulfill
[48:15] the word just caused one dead Egyptian
[48:18] and him running at the first sign of
[48:20] trouble
[48:22] see if we are humanly convinced that all
[48:26] we need is human ability everything we
[48:29] do will come to nothing right but if we
[48:31] are convinced this is God then God will
[48:34] fulfill his word then God will manifest
[48:37] the promise right because Moses Moses
[48:40] would run as as as he you know because
[48:43] um he he realized by the two uh Hebrews
[48:47] speaking that you know Pharaoh is going
[48:49] to know about this that I killed an
[48:50] Egyptian and he ran he ran from he ran
[48:53] into the land of Midian and he came to a
[48:56] place where he
[48:57] he you know he married um the the the
[48:59] chief of midian's daughter Zapora and it
[49:02] says here and Moses was content to dwell
[49:04] with the man so he was content and that
[49:07] word content means um through the idea
[49:09] of mental weakness it means properly to
[49:11] yield so he knew he was the promised son
[49:14] to deliver but then because it was just
[49:16] he was just convinced humanly then he
[49:19] ran from trouble and then he and then he
[49:21] just he just he just basically sat back
[49:22] and said well this is my lot now I'm
[49:24] just going to be a Shepherd for my
[49:26] father-in-law I'm going to be away from
[49:28] my people away from the promise I'm just
[49:29] going to make this little safety zone of
[49:31] a life this comfort zone and I'm going
[49:33] to stay in this comfort zone and
[49:35] everything's going to be just
[49:37] fine this but but this wasn't his
[49:39] portion am mean because you got to
[49:41] realize that you know he was convinced
[49:45] now he was mentally convinced he could
[49:47] do it but then when trouble came and it
[49:49] didn't come out the way he thought it
[49:50] should come then he became convinced
[49:52] he's not the deliverer and he became
[49:54] convinced that his own failures
[49:57] brought him this way why cuz he's TR
[49:59] trusting in himself are you following me
[50:01] maybe we're just walking along today but
[50:03] you know I just want you to think about
[50:04] these things because what are you
[50:05] convinced by are you convinced by your
[50:08] upbringing convinced by the church
[50:09] convinced by your own ability or are you
[50:11] convinced by God that this is his word I
[50:15] mean to Moses actions thought he was he
[50:18] was convinced by his own failures now
[50:21] let's just look isn't it amazing when
[50:22] God would because everything that Moses
[50:25] lacked the burning bush had
[50:27] yes right right so the one that gave the
[50:29] promise was going to be the one that
[50:30] would fulfill the promise but he had to
[50:32] be convinced by God himself that he had
[50:35] been sent now now here he was now and
[50:39] and Moses it's amazing when you read
[50:41] through the account when when when when
[50:43] God Appears to him in the burning bush
[50:45] all Moses gives is
[50:47] excuses all he gives is excuses but he
[50:49] knew down in his heart he was the one to
[50:52] fulfill the word he knew he was but
[50:55] thing is he cont he
[50:57] let's just go back to that word again
[50:58] see and but he was content to dwell with
[51:01] the man and he gave Moses Zapora his
[51:03] daughter so he was so content with
[51:06] living this little comfort zone of a
[51:08] life yet circumcised son of Abraham yet
[51:11] a Believer all right but he was content
[51:13] to live in this little safety zone that
[51:16] when God came and spoke to him in the
[51:17] burning bush all he could give was
[51:19] excuses about why he couldn't fulfill it
[51:21] why CU he was still convinced it would
[51:23] have to be his own human ability that
[51:25] could fulfill it right he had to
[51:27] surrender to God that God was going to
[51:30] come and do it and how many people say
[51:33] yes I'm going to I'm going to be an
[51:34] overcomer yes I'm going to be the bride
[51:36] of Christ yes I'm going to fulfill the
[51:37] word but they convinced it's their own
[51:39] ability this is not our own ability
[51:41] right I trust you have come that that's
[51:43] why we can say thank you God for the
[51:44] scars because scars can come because we
[51:47] it's like Moses had a lot of scars he
[51:49] had regret from killing that man and
[51:52] trying to do it his own self and look
[51:53] he's just a failure no doubt that
[51:55] haunted him for 40 years
[51:57] and then and then but then he built a
[51:58] complex around it that when God came his
[52:01] way he says look at this he says look
[52:03] behold thou not believe me he was the
[52:06] one who gave the promise had manifested
[52:08] himself to him and he said no no no
[52:10] they're not going to believe me you know
[52:12] they won't hearken to my voice for
[52:13] they'll say the god that the Lord ha not
[52:15] appeared unto thee and then if you keep
[52:18] reading down it says Moses said unto the
[52:19] Lord oh Lord I am not eloquent neither
[52:22] here um here to for nor nor since thou
[52:25] Hast spoken unto thy servant but I'm
[52:27] slow of speech and of a slow tongue so
[52:31] he's just giving excuses why he can't do
[52:33] it isn't that interesting yeah I thought
[52:35] you know but why because he's still
[52:36] being convinced by his own ability he
[52:38] was convinced his own self could not
[52:41] fulfill it and that's why actually God
[52:43] just got anointed him saying come on man
[52:44] who made the mouth to speak who made
[52:47] your vocal cords who made you I've made
[52:49] you to fulfill This Promise Moses I made
[52:51] you to fulfill this prophecy why are you
[52:53] doubting why are you looking at yourself
[52:56] why you look at your own problems and
[52:57] your own regret and your own past look
[52:59] into my word look into me because I am
[53:02] what you lack amen I am here to convince
[53:04] you that you're here to fulfill this
[53:06] word amen amen it's the same thing
[53:08] friends with you and I we we I trust
[53:11] we're convinced this message is for us I
[53:13] can I trust we are convinced the Rapture
[53:15] is for us I trust we're convinced that
[53:17] we these bodies are going to be changed
[53:19] amen I trust that we are convinced that
[53:22] the blood of Jesus Christ is more than
[53:24] enough sir am to take away all sin all
[53:28] sorrow all guilt all shame it's all gone
[53:31] father hallelujah amen see he had a even
[53:35] brother Bram was speaking about a
[53:37] brother um he said you know um uh
[53:41] brother brother Rell here he says now he
[53:44] says I'm going to ask a dear friend of
[53:45] mine a young Minister sitting out here
[53:47] he had a kind of a complex and he and
[53:50] his little wife used to come to my house
[53:51] all the time and he' just sit around and
[53:53] he wouldn't talk and he just asked one
[53:55] question brother Braham what what do you
[53:56] think the Lord uh what do you think the
[53:58] Lord has called me to the ministry and I
[54:00] saw the potentials of this young man
[54:02] from A Fine Bible Institution but he
[54:04] just lacked like Moses with all of his
[54:07] training what Moses lacked the burning
[54:09] bush had that's what brother Adell
[54:11] lacked is what the burning bush had and
[54:13] one day it caught fire amen like Moses
[54:17] he caught fire amen fire spreads Fire's
[54:20] looking for fuel amen fire is looking
[54:22] for something to ignite amen and a real
[54:24] genuine sincere heart it'll your flame
[54:27] amen if you open your heart and let God
[54:29] in amen Moses was trying to put up all
[54:31] kind of walls of excuses but God didn't
[54:33] relent amen and you'll hear message
[54:35] after message sermon after sermon song
[54:37] after song we say come unto me my child
[54:40] I'll give you rest I'll give you peace
[54:42] I'll take your frustration from you I'll
[54:44] take your annoyance from you I'll take
[54:45] your bug beard away I will reveal
[54:47] yourself I will reveal myself to you but
[54:50] you've got to lead them in amen
[54:52] hallelujah amen how many people try and
[54:55] come to God on their own terms you to
[54:56] come to God on his
[54:58] terms amen but you see you see so Moses
[55:01] everything he lacked the burning bush
[55:03] had amen and everything we lack the
[55:05] pillar of fire possesses amen and we
[55:07] know that Pillar of Fire is present
[55:09] Among Us he said I'll never leave you
[55:10] nor forsake you where where the true
[55:13] word is preached the pillar fire is in
[55:14] attendance amen and what I love about it
[55:17] is God told Moses take your staff what's
[55:20] in your hand he throws it on the ground
[55:22] amen it became a serpent he ran away
[55:24] from it and God says pick it up by the
[55:26] by by the tail picks up turns into a
[55:27] staff again take your hand put it into
[55:29] your bosom pull it out becomes lepos put
[55:32] it back it becomes normal and you know
[55:33] the amazing thing is what God did to him
[55:36] in secret he manifested openly amen so
[55:39] the testimony wasn't just yes I had this
[55:41] time with God but God brought that
[55:43] testimony into the public am mean to
[55:46] prove what God had convinced him with
[55:48] was real amen so you see the fruit of
[55:52] the fruit of the commission became
[55:54] manifested in the palace amen what Moses
[55:57] went into the palace threw a staff down
[55:59] it became a cobra or a snake and he took
[56:01] it by a tail and it became normal again
[56:04] ien so the fruit that God promised would
[56:06] be manifested became manifested amen
[56:08] it's it's the same thing when you're
[56:09] convinced this word is Right amen you
[56:12] will have joy you will have peace you
[56:15] will have love you will have faith amen
[56:17] now you may be a lot of lot of trouble
[56:19] in your mind this morning put that to
[56:20] one side amen God has called you to
[56:23] manifest this word amen you were
[56:25] convinced many years ago it's right it's
[56:27] still right but the devil wants to try
[56:29] and derail you amen from stop you to try
[56:33] and think now was my convin what am I
[56:35] actually convinced what made you start
[56:37] in the first
[56:38] place what made you start in the first
[56:40] place why are you still here you say I
[56:42] don't feel like being here but yet
[56:44] you're here why are you here God's
[56:46] called you here God's brought you here
[56:48] God wants to show you what you're
[56:49] convinced by as not man you weren't
[56:51] influenced by family you weren't
[56:52] influenced by a nice idea no God came
[56:55] one day yes my spoke to you and say this
[56:57] is me amen cuz Moses could have sat
[56:59] there for another 40 years and said well
[57:02] what what about this what about that but
[57:04] then God came his way and said no I'm
[57:06] going to convince you and I'm going to
[57:08] convince you and I'm going to prove it
[57:10] amen hallelujah so what happens now the
[57:13] the evidence that we're convinced is God
[57:15] Lives the evidence is that we believe
[57:18] his word amen the evidence is that we
[57:21] take him at his word maybe I'm maybe
[57:23] simplifying things too much but you got
[57:24] to realize that we're we're a convinced
[57:27] people hallelujah now if you've got
[57:30] faith that's ridiculous to everyone but
[57:31] God and the fellow that's got it amen
[57:34] faith is a finds a source that others
[57:36] can't see amen Moses had a source you
[57:39] know when he walked into Egypt you know
[57:41] because what happened God commissioned
[57:43] him at the burning bush he became
[57:45] convinced by God it was the season was
[57:47] the time and he was the right man for
[57:48] the job he became a s he he became a
[57:51] surrendered human vessel to the
[57:54] commission am mean that's what if you're
[57:56] really convinced you become surrendered
[57:58] amen you don't try and do it in your own
[58:00] if you're convinced up here you do it
[58:01] with this but if you're really convinced
[58:03] in here you let God do it amen you let
[58:05] God fulfill his word so now Moses you
[58:08] got his two young got his wife put put
[58:10] them on a mule and went down into Egypt
[58:13] went through the Customs you know filled
[58:15] out the customs declaration form purpose
[58:17] of visit he he saw visiting relatives
[58:19] yes that's true business yeah I'm
[58:21] definitely on business and what about
[58:23] other he put one man Invasion maybe gave
[58:25] it to to the Customs guy thought crazy
[58:27] old man stamped his passport let him go
[58:29] through thing is he did it what are you
[58:31] doing Moses where are you going I'm
[58:33] invading Egypt maybe a lot of people
[58:35] thought he was a crazy man he wasn't a
[58:37] crazy man he found a source that that
[58:40] amen he found a source amen that others
[58:42] could not see but he saw it amen cuz he
[58:45] be to he realized the god that made him
[58:47] in the burning bush didn't leave him
[58:49] there amen but went before him went with
[58:51] him went in him amen that when he went
[58:53] into um Pharaoh's Palace and he said let
[58:56] let my people go that was God speaking
[58:58] it was the one who gave the conv you
[59:00] know convinced Moses spoke through Moses
[59:02] and said let my people go amen so Moses
[59:05] Moses was thoroughly
[59:07] convinced that God is here to do it yes
[59:09] sir he was thoroughly convinced God is
[59:12] here to fulfill his word in his life
[59:14] amen and I trust you are thoroughly
[59:16] convinced this morning God is more than
[59:18] able to do it the devil try and push you
[59:20] and push you saying you can't do it
[59:22] you've done too much you've done too
[59:24] much wrong no when he speaks
[59:26] 100 billion failures disappear we're all
[59:29] failures friends we were born failures
[59:32] we fail every day but he's the unfailing
[59:34] one if we keep our confidence in him
[59:37] amen we may fail we'll hey I'm sorry
[59:39] folks we'll fail again amen amen I'm
[59:42] sorry but he does not fail amen we may
[59:44] have lost a lot of battles but we won't
[59:46] lose the war amen like General Patton
[59:49] said one day he he had lost a couple of
[59:51] battles and you know you know he said
[59:53] you he's calling for new recruits fresh
[59:54] men to send to the front and you know
[59:56] he'd say give me men don't give me boys
[59:59] you know give me give me men with
[1:00:01] courage you know and you know people are
[1:00:02] saying yeah but you're losing these War
[1:00:04] you you're losing these battles he said
[1:00:06] but I haven't lost the war you know
[1:00:08] eisenh how would say you know you put a
[1:00:09] shell in the gun you fire it and maybe
[1:00:11] it doesn't even go off you don't throw
[1:00:13] it down and quit you put that shell out
[1:00:14] you put another shell in and you fire
[1:00:16] until it hits home amen it's like prayer
[1:00:18] amen sometimes you feel well it's just
[1:00:20] there's just no point put another shell
[1:00:22] in the gun I mean you want to change the
[1:00:24] atmosphere in your life put on another
[1:00:26] song I mean think on another scripture
[1:00:28] put another shell in the gun it'll fire
[1:00:30] amen it'll hit its Target amen don't sit
[1:00:32] there saying what's wrong with the
[1:00:33] weapon no the weapon works perfectly
[1:00:36] amen but keep firing until you get in
[1:00:38] condition that God can take over amen
[1:00:40] that's what we need this morning friends
[1:00:42] amen is to allow God to take over amen
[1:00:45] Moses put the shell in the gun of his
[1:00:46] own ability it just popped and did
[1:00:48] nothing but when he surrendered when he
[1:00:50] became convinced amen nothing could stop
[1:00:52] him you think about it one the the small
[1:00:56] smallest man in Pharaoh's Army could
[1:00:58] have killed him with a spear but nothing
[1:01:00] could stop him cuz he was convinced amen
[1:01:02] so when he went in before Pharaoh's
[1:01:04] Court he knew what it was like to be
[1:01:06] there he knew the pomp he knew the
[1:01:08] authority that Pharaoh had one word from
[1:01:10] Pharaoh kill that man take him out
[1:01:12] execute him it was done but he was
[1:01:14] Fearless why cuz he was convinced I mean
[1:01:16] he wasn't intimidated by Pharaoh in his
[1:01:18] Palace no cuz he was convinced that God
[1:01:20] could do it I mean so when he went in
[1:01:22] there he said let my people go and
[1:01:24] Pharaoh said no he says well God's going
[1:01:26] to plague you until you you have to let
[1:01:29] them go why cuz God had already given
[1:01:31] them the promise that they were going to
[1:01:32] be brought out with a mighty hand with
[1:01:34] great substance amen so Moses knew that
[1:01:37] was going to happen cuz he was convinced
[1:01:40] the one who gave the promise is the one
[1:01:41] who's going to fulfill the promise amen
[1:01:43] so it doesn't matter what opposition he
[1:01:44] came against God's going to fulfill it
[1:01:47] are we convinced this morning are we
[1:01:49] convinced this word is true are we
[1:01:51] convinced that God is able to meet every
[1:01:53] situation I mean are we convinced that
[1:01:55] he can do say well it seems impossible
[1:01:57] Our God works in the impossible am mean
[1:02:00] our God works you look at you look at
[1:02:02] Enoch it was it was impossible for Enoch
[1:02:05] to walk with God and be taken in his own
[1:02:07] ability but God showed Enoch I'm going
[1:02:09] to show you something impossible today
[1:02:11] I'm going to use you to show that when
[1:02:13] people walk with me I'm going to take
[1:02:15] them in a Rapture amen amen it was
[1:02:18] impossible for Noah hey he could have
[1:02:20] built a boat people can build
[1:02:22] boats but to build at the right
[1:02:24] dimensions you know that vot
[1:02:26] architecturally Naval Architects say the
[1:02:28] dimensions of the Ark are perfect for
[1:02:30] stability the ratio of length and width
[1:02:32] and height it's perfect because all it
[1:02:34] needed to do was float it wasn't winning
[1:02:36] the America's Cup didn't have to
[1:02:37] hydrofoil it just had to survive right
[1:02:41] you know so so it it was really you know
[1:02:43] so yeah sure he could have made a boat
[1:02:45] but to make it that perfectly and get
[1:02:47] all the animals there how did they go
[1:02:49] round them up no God LED them God
[1:02:51] anointed them to walk into that Ark
[1:02:54] maybe it took them a few Generations
[1:02:55] like the tortois or I don't know how
[1:02:57] long that took but they started walking
[1:02:58] eventually they started migrating amen
[1:03:01] there was a pull towards the ark it's
[1:03:02] the same thing with you and I friends
[1:03:04] there's a pull towards Christ amen it
[1:03:06] may take us a while but we're on our way
[1:03:08] we're walking amen if you're in it's
[1:03:10] wonderful if you're on your way don't
[1:03:11] stop don't stop saying no Lord I want
[1:03:14] Total Victory I want Total I want Total
[1:03:16] Joy I want Total peace I want to be
[1:03:18] totally in not just walking up the ramp
[1:03:20] not just seeing it yes I see the Lord is
[1:03:22] true and I see he's real no step into
[1:03:24] him give your life to him baptized in
[1:03:26] his name amen hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:03:29] you see now so that was
[1:03:32] impossible Moses impossible he tried it
[1:03:36] it failed God anointed him it worked the
[1:03:39] Red Sea you know scientists come up with
[1:03:41] all kind of excuses how it happened no
[1:03:44] God caused a wind to blow and they
[1:03:46] walked on dry ground who's ever walked
[1:03:48] even in a lake or a river and you just
[1:03:50] like your foot your legs half in the
[1:03:52] mud they walked on dry ground that's
[1:03:55] right who did that God did that how did
[1:03:57] he do it he did it moisture go down he
[1:04:00] just did this you know impossible and
[1:04:02] then at the right time they're all over
[1:04:04] and the thing closes on
[1:04:06] Pharaoh Hallelujah they got fed in the
[1:04:08] wilderness by Mana all these things
[1:04:10] impossible things David against Goliath
[1:04:13] you say well that was just a statistical
[1:04:15] anomaly of a Shepherd boy hitting a
[1:04:18] hitting a champion in the head with a
[1:04:20] with a sling no that was God anointed
[1:04:21] that rock David was convinced amen that
[1:04:25] he was a circumcised son of Abraham God
[1:04:28] had made a covenant with him he was
[1:04:29] living in his Promised Land amen he was
[1:04:32] living in his inheritance he was an
[1:04:33] adopted son of God and this enemy came
[1:04:35] on his ground and he just realized well
[1:04:37] God said one will chase a th two will
[1:04:39] chase 10,000 what is this uncircumcised
[1:04:42] Philistine compared to the armies of the
[1:04:43] Living God he was convinced I mean Saul
[1:04:46] and his men were were only humanly
[1:04:48] convinced they thought yes it can be
[1:04:50] done but they didn't know it could be
[1:04:52] done I mean but David knew it could be
[1:04:53] done cuz he was convinced that God could
[1:04:55] do
[1:04:56] am me so when when that sling when he
[1:04:58] released that stone amen God anointed
[1:05:00] that stone and it went straight to the
[1:05:02] killing Place amen and he fell on his
[1:05:04] head and even David said I'm going to
[1:05:05] cut your head off he had no sword am
[1:05:07] mean but but Goliath brought his own
[1:05:09] sword am mean it shows you that the
[1:05:11] devil actually sets himself up for
[1:05:13] failure I mean as soon as he you know
[1:05:15] reveals himself you know devil you just
[1:05:17] told me how I can kill you I mean if
[1:05:19] you're feeling depressed we realize
[1:05:21] that's a spirit of depression amen if
[1:05:23] you're feeling just rebellious you don't
[1:05:24] want to be here don't want to follow God
[1:05:26] that's a spirit of rebellion trying to
[1:05:27] get you you got to realize the devil's
[1:05:29] just exposed himself now you can stand
[1:05:31] against that thing now you can't expose
[1:05:33] that thing amen like the Bible says
[1:05:36] confess your faults one to another amen
[1:05:38] what is that doing you are actually
[1:05:40] stepping out from being the devil's
[1:05:41] human shield yeah shoot this
[1:05:45] guy it Lor it's good we need to expose
[1:05:49] Satan amen we need to expose him
[1:05:52] sometimes we can't get in words what are
[1:05:54] we facing it's like God give give me a
[1:05:56] name just like some sometimes well it's
[1:05:58] it's good way to go to the doctor but
[1:06:00] you know you get diagnosed with
[1:06:01] something praise the lord we we now have
[1:06:02] a
[1:06:03] name amen now we can pray against this
[1:06:06] thing praise the lord well do you need
[1:06:08] to get a name not necessarily but it's
[1:06:10] nice to know who you're
[1:06:11] hunting amen it's nice to know what
[1:06:14] trophies you're going to put on your
[1:06:16] wall of God's grace don't you think so
[1:06:20] like what have you shot Maria you say
[1:06:21] what have you shot and you say well I've
[1:06:23] shot this thing it wouldn't mean much to
[1:06:24] me but the hunters here about wow that's
[1:06:25] incredible why cuz there's a name to it
[1:06:28] amen it's like you know it's like
[1:06:31] David's carrying Goliath's head you know
[1:06:34] and if he said if he said uh you know
[1:06:36] people say who head you dragging David
[1:06:38] oh just a Philistine that wouldn't mean
[1:06:39] too much they said this is Goliath of
[1:06:42] gath and the reputation of that guy
[1:06:44] who's now dead would have been wow you
[1:06:46] killed him yeah cuz I'm con I was
[1:06:48] convinced I was convinced that God could
[1:06:50] do it and he did it amen I've got the
[1:06:52] evidence praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:06:55] praise the Lord
[1:06:56] L amen I trust no I believe we're
[1:06:59] convinced amen amen see but without
[1:07:01] faith it's impossible to please him so
[1:07:03] with faith it's impossible not to please
[1:07:05] him so so if so if God has revealed
[1:07:08] himself to you which is Faith it's
[1:07:10] impossible for you not to please him for
[1:07:11] he that cometh to God must must believe
[1:07:13] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:07:16] them that diligently seek Him amen so if
[1:07:18] you're convinced see where's your source
[1:07:20] of strength this morning what is your
[1:07:22] source of strength my strength Cometh
[1:07:24] From The Lord amen amen amen not social
[1:07:27] media not scrolling not not

[1:07:32] From The Lord my strength is in him amen
[1:07:36] so we're got to realize he is a rewarder
[1:07:38] of them that diligently seek him because
[1:07:41] when you seek him with all your heart
[1:07:42] you shall find him the Bible says it's
[1:07:44] not you might you will hallelujah
[1:07:46] hallelujah you say well I tried once
[1:07:48] upon a time put another shell in the gun
[1:07:51] put another shell in the gun amen don't
[1:07:53] be don't be discouraged that Devil Wants
[1:07:55] You discouraged but I pray God encourage
[1:07:57] you this morning amen like the saraph
[1:07:59] phenician woman who had a had a daughter
[1:08:01] that was grievously vexed with the devil
[1:08:03] she was convinced that this man Jesus of
[1:08:05] Nazareth could could set her daughter
[1:08:07] free he she was thoroughly convinced not
[1:08:09] in her head but in her heart so then she
[1:08:12] started to go and the deci you know she
[1:08:14] you know she starts calling you know uh
[1:08:16] son of man have mercy on me and all
[1:08:18] these things and the disciples even
[1:08:20] saying she's calling after us and then
[1:08:23] but then of course she's calling after
[1:08:25] the Lord but then the Lord would say to
[1:08:27] her you know or or to the disciples tell
[1:08:29] her you know I'm not sent to Gentiles
[1:08:33] I'm not sent so what happened her first
[1:08:35] prayer seemed to come back in her face
[1:08:38] but she was convinced she was convinced
[1:08:41] this man had the ability to free her
[1:08:43] daughter because she was convinced in
[1:08:45] here she did not take a no for an answer
[1:08:48] she did not she did not settle for well
[1:08:50] I guess that didn't work she did not
[1:08:52] allow anything to offend her she no she
[1:08:54] was convinced
[1:08:56] and then you know and then and then he
[1:08:57] would say well you know it's not meat to
[1:08:59] give the you know you know the bread to
[1:09:02] the bread to the dogs but she said yay
[1:09:04] Lord true but even the dogs get the
[1:09:06] crumbs under the
[1:09:07] table and he said you're really
[1:09:10] convinced great is your faith Hallelujah
[1:09:14] so she didn't stop until she got what
[1:09:16] she needed amen he's a rewarder of them
[1:09:19] that diligently seek Him are you
[1:09:21] convinced this morning he say well where
[1:09:24] is he that I can I can talk to him like
[1:09:26] that Faith contacts him he's the high
[1:09:28] priest you touched by the feeling of
[1:09:30] your infirmity amen he's not some
[1:09:32] distant place you know it took it was
[1:09:34] her faith that touched Jesus it wasn't
[1:09:36] her words it was her faith amen blind
[1:09:39] bmas was convinced that this Jesus of
[1:09:41] Nazareth was the same one or greater
[1:09:44] than the prophets that his mom told him
[1:09:46] about sitting by the wall of Jericho
[1:09:48] there he became convinced that's why he
[1:09:51] would holler out son of son of David
[1:09:53] have mercy on me and it was not it
[1:09:55] wasn't his his the audible sound of his
[1:09:58] voice that stopped Jesus it was his
[1:10:01] faith you know the people told him be
[1:10:03] quiet sit still you're causing trouble
[1:10:05] shush shush Bas you just gone crazy well
[1:10:07] no he was convinced amen he was
[1:10:10] convinced so when the devil when the
[1:10:12] devil tells you to shut up no you're
[1:10:15] you're you've been convinced you be
[1:10:16] greater than the devil trying to tell
[1:10:17] you to shut up when he says no don't say
[1:10:19] Amen don't enter in don't sing don't
[1:10:21] raise your hands it's just like that mob
[1:10:23] telling blind b m to be quiet yeah he
[1:10:26] said no no I'm convinced that the Lord
[1:10:28] Jesus as he passes by this way amen I
[1:10:30] can I can cause him to stand still amen
[1:10:32] that I can draw from him what I have
[1:10:34] need of Hallelujah why cuz I'm convinced
[1:10:37] that his word has the ability amen has
[1:10:39] the power hallelujah amen to do what it
[1:10:42] said it would do Hallelujah but you see
[1:10:45] human humanly being convinced changes
[1:10:48] I'm just going back to this you know
[1:10:50] they would they would cry in Egypt
[1:10:52] Israel would because of the reason of
[1:10:54] their task Masters
[1:10:55] and they you know they would cry you
[1:10:58] know you know they were they were
[1:11:00] convinced that this is not how they
[1:11:02] should be they're not meant to be slaves
[1:11:04] they were convinced but they are just
[1:11:06] humanly convinced because when they came
[1:11:09] to when they came to be delivered they
[1:11:13] begin to
[1:11:14] complain we should be convinced that
[1:11:17] depression
[1:11:19] anxiety doubt unbelief skepticism
[1:11:24] pessimism
[1:11:26] cynicism depression none of those things
[1:11:29] are our portion they are not ours they
[1:11:31] do not belong to you they should never
[1:11:33] belong to you the devil wants you to
[1:11:35] make you think they're yours but they're
[1:11:36] not yours pain hurt regret guilt shame
[1:11:40] it's not our portion no the Lord Jesus
[1:11:42] died that we'd be free of all those
[1:11:43] things but you've got to be convinced
[1:11:45] that his blood is more than enough amen
[1:11:48] so even they would just humanly
[1:11:49] convinced because when they came by the
[1:11:51] Red Sea you think about it they're about
[1:11:53] to see the greatest thing they had ever
[1:11:55] seen up to that point why because their
[1:11:57] enemy that was pursuing them was going
[1:11:59] to die so that enemy could not pursue
[1:12:02] them anymore sure it's one thing to
[1:12:04] leave Egypt it's another thing for Egypt
[1:12:06] not be able to pursue you amen so here
[1:12:09] they were and they cried out they said
[1:12:11] were there no graves in Egypt that thou
[1:12:12] has taken us to die in the wilderness
[1:12:14] where wherefore hast thou dealt thus
[1:12:16] with us to carry us forth out of Egypt
[1:12:19] so basically what have you done to us
[1:12:22] God came and called them out that's what
[1:12:24] God had done that's what God had used
[1:12:26] Moses for you know but but W they Graves
[1:12:29] why have you taken us to die here it was
[1:12:31] better to die in Egypt really in Egypt
[1:12:34] their their their baby boys were thrown
[1:12:36] to the crocodiles they were used as just
[1:12:39] they they were treated Less in Pharaoh's
[1:12:41] horses if they died they died the
[1:12:43] Egyptians didn't care about them they
[1:12:44] were abused and used and all kinds of
[1:12:46] things and they got to a point where
[1:12:48] they said actually it's better for us to
[1:12:49] be back
[1:12:50] there that's a but you see this is just
[1:12:53] being convinced in here because trouble
[1:12:56] had came their
[1:12:57] way amen is this not the word we did
[1:12:59] tell in Egypt saying let us alone that
[1:13:01] we may serve the Egyptians for it been
[1:13:03] better for us to serve the Egyptians
[1:13:05] that than that we should die in the
[1:13:06] wilderness I tell you friends I'd rather
[1:13:08] die delivered than die slave I would
[1:13:12] rather die amen a free man than a slave
[1:13:15] man amen so I'd rather die serving God
[1:13:18] than serving some depression some
[1:13:20] anxiety some trouble some doubt in my
[1:13:22] mind some culture something going on in
[1:13:24] the world I'd rather die a free man
[1:13:26] serving God any day amen then then be
[1:13:30] bound in the world Lord but you see and
[1:13:32] then what happened Moses said stand
[1:13:34] still and you know fear not and stand
[1:13:35] still you shall see the salvation of the
[1:13:37] Lord what happened the Red Sea opened up
[1:13:39] they walk through on dry ground the
[1:13:40] Egyptians tried to follow them and they
[1:13:42] drowned amen and God was see they were
[1:13:45] complaining just before they were about
[1:13:46] to see their enemy killed Amen to this
[1:13:49] enemy that would come back day after day
[1:13:51] and afflict them trouble them in their
[1:13:52] mind trouble them beat them all these
[1:13:54] things thing was going to be destroyed
[1:13:56] that would never come back again
[1:13:59] Hallelujah that's why they danced on the
[1:14:01] danced on the other side of the bank cuz
[1:14:02] they saw their enemy dead amen and when
[1:14:04] you come through the blood of Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ amen every enemy that's bothered
[1:14:07] you is drowned in the blood of Jesus
[1:14:09] Christ and you can do a victory dance
[1:14:11] Amen on the other side saying hallelujah
[1:14:13] I've been delivered I've been delivered
[1:14:15] I've been delivered amen A Hallelujah
[1:14:18] isn't that right maybe we should break
[1:14:19] out the tambourine a bit more amen
[1:14:22] hallelujah maybe we should go back to
[1:14:23] our Red Sea experience and rejoice about
[1:14:25] that a bit more amen don't you like to
[1:14:27] go down memory lane sometimes and
[1:14:28] remember where God has taken you from
[1:14:31] Hallelujah to put your joy joy shoes on
[1:14:33] Amen Hallelujah even see now when the
[1:14:36] spies when the when the 12 Spies came
[1:14:39] back when they came back from from the
[1:14:42] promised land Moses sent them out you
[1:14:43] know it took two men to carry a big
[1:14:45] bunch of grapes and they brought they
[1:14:47] brought evidence of the land that it was
[1:14:49] a land flowing with milk and honey yes
[1:14:51] the fruit was sweet amen it was it was
[1:14:54] an amazing amazing land it was exactly
[1:14:56] as God told us it would be it wasn't a
[1:14:59] land flowing with sand and I don't know
[1:15:02] it was milk and honey exactly as God
[1:15:05] said of the streams the Brooks the all
[1:15:07] those things the plenteous places to
[1:15:09] grow fruit and and and and have
[1:15:12] livestock and so on was exactly as they
[1:15:15] said all 12 said yes that's true but you
[1:15:18] see and all 12 said but there's Giants
[1:15:20] there there's walled cities there's
[1:15:22] Great Men you know you know there's all
[1:15:24] these things but 10 of them of the 12
[1:15:28] were not convinced in here they were
[1:15:30] convinced in here I mean so when they
[1:15:32] saw the opposition they said but we
[1:15:35] can't take it why cuz they're convinced
[1:15:37] in here why because they were still the
[1:15:40] reason I could say they're convincing
[1:15:41] here because they are trusting their
[1:15:43] human ability to take the land I mean
[1:15:45] because they said we are grasshoppers in
[1:15:47] their sights in other words we are so
[1:15:48] small they're just going to chew us up
[1:15:51] but then Caleb and Joshua said no we are
[1:15:53] more than able to take the land I mean
[1:15:55] what they were convinced in here that
[1:15:57] what God has started he's going to
[1:15:59] finish doesn't matter the battles the
[1:16:01] the the problems the struggles the
[1:16:03] hardship the disappointment the regret
[1:16:05] doesn't matter what we're going to go
[1:16:06] through Israel we're going to get there
[1:16:08] I mean exactly as God has said where
[1:16:10] we're going to live we're going to live
[1:16:12] amen the prophecy of of of every every
[1:16:15] of those 12 Patriarchs when their name
[1:16:17] was spoken and you you know the
[1:16:18] blessings were given I think the end of
[1:16:20] Genesis that was actually prophecy of
[1:16:22] where the tribes would be in the land
[1:16:24] yes amen what god prophesied with that
[1:16:26] dwell they're going to dwell I say
[1:16:28] friends it's the same thing with you and
[1:16:29] I amen we should be so convinced this
[1:16:32] word is going to take us it's brought us
[1:16:33] out of the world it's brought us out of
[1:16:35] many things amen it's placed us into
[1:16:37] Christ amen that every Redemptive
[1:16:39] blessing of God belongs to you and I
[1:16:41] every promise amen we are not here in a
[1:16:45] stalemate the devil wants you to think
[1:16:47] you're stuck this way Saul and Israel
[1:16:49] were stuck for 40 days with Goliath and
[1:16:52] and the Philistines right but then one
[1:16:54] man one boy stepped in who was convinced
[1:16:57] we don't have to be in the stalemate we
[1:16:59] don't have to be stuck this way you
[1:17:01] don't have to put up with the Mind B you
[1:17:02] have to put up with a problem depression
[1:17:04] all that you don't have to live with
[1:17:05] those things anymore you say but all of
[1:17:07] my family had the spirit in Me God is
[1:17:09] here to break it amen you see you got to
[1:17:13] realize how your parents are you don't
[1:17:14] have to be that way Naturally Speaking
[1:17:17] he if this filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:19] praise God but if they're struggling
[1:17:21] with things you got to realize there
[1:17:23] comes the devil has expiry date but are
[1:17:26] you convinced that it is here for him in
[1:17:30] your life it is overdue amen like I was
[1:17:33] coaching or helping with Anisa's netb
[1:17:35] and there was an app with the um app
[1:17:37] with the um score and stuff you know
[1:17:39] they going all fancy instead of pen and
[1:17:41] paper and so you start the start the
[1:17:44] half and of course you the ref's doing
[1:17:46] all kinds of things but then it goes
[1:17:47] into overtime on the app you actually
[1:17:49] have to physically go end and go end
[1:17:52] game otherwise you just keep running
[1:17:55] how many of us actually just let the
[1:17:56] game keep running with the devil we
[1:17:59] allow him to bombard us and to trouble
[1:18:02] us and we keep doing what he wants us to
[1:18:04] do instead of saying Satan I'm sick of
[1:18:06] you I'm going to feed I'm going to feed
[1:18:09] on something else it's like Christine
[1:18:11] was talking to the girls after I was
[1:18:12] talking about salt you know if you're
[1:18:13] fully hydrated with fresh water you
[1:18:16] drink salt water it's not going to
[1:18:17] bother someone like someone who's
[1:18:19] dehydrated why cuz you're full of fresh
[1:18:21] water right so naturally if you're being
[1:18:24] de hydrated by the world with salt water
[1:18:26] of this world start taking a fresh drink
[1:18:28] of water cuz you got to realize if the
[1:18:30] first drink of this world made you
[1:18:32] dehydrated instead of making you act a
[1:18:35] little bit crazy the second drink is not
[1:18:37] going to help
[1:18:38] you amen you got to change where you're
[1:18:40] drinking from amen so I would drink from
[1:18:42] The Well of Living Water I would start
[1:18:45] drinking from this word amen IID start
[1:18:46] listening to it I start praying start
[1:18:48] changing the music you know maybe
[1:18:51] there's a total tangent but we need holy
[1:18:53] uh I'm not saying we don't have this but
[1:18:56] when it comes to listening to
[1:18:57] contemporary Christian music you you
[1:18:58] need Holy Ghost leadership because how
[1:19:01] many of those gifted people are sitting
[1:19:03] in darkness trying to talk about a
[1:19:04] relationship they don't have that the
[1:19:07] bride has but they don't have you've got
[1:19:09] to be careful that it's Holy Ghost
[1:19:11] inspired if you're listening to that
[1:19:12] stuff amen right because many times
[1:19:14] they're sitting on this side of the
[1:19:15] chasm trying to sing about something
[1:19:17] they don't know and that and it's just a
[1:19:18] longing right and then and then that
[1:19:20] longing will come upon you and they'll
[1:19:23] try and give you that same experience
[1:19:25] when you're on the other side of the
[1:19:26] chasm Walking with
[1:19:28] God so we got to be careful with those
[1:19:30] things we say Lord lead us in what we
[1:19:32] listen to amen but but but if the music
[1:19:34] you listen to just makes you feel more
[1:19:36] empty makes you feel less stable makes
[1:19:38] you feel you know more depressed or but
[1:19:40] but there's a sincerity with it but you
[1:19:42] I'm just this little thing and no we are
[1:19:44] more than conquerors I mean we're more
[1:19:46] than Overcomers he overcame for us amen
[1:19:48] we are not defeated we're not
[1:19:50] downtrodden we're not beaten we're not
[1:19:52] useless no we are the apple of God's eye
[1:19:54] we are his redeemed we are his loved
[1:19:56] ones we are the purpose of his being
[1:19:59] praise God Amen so you got to think what
[1:20:01] are you listening to does it build Faith
[1:20:04] now oh but it makes me emotional of
[1:20:06] course it makes you emotional music
[1:20:07] should be emotional even even sitting
[1:20:10] there I remember in um you know you know
[1:20:13] dead formal Anglican Church at boarding
[1:20:15] school that made people emotional being
[1:20:18] bored and being annoyed as
[1:20:20] emotion it makes even un emotional so
[1:20:23] you got to be careful with what you but
[1:20:24] it makes me feel the certain way but
[1:20:26] what is the feeling what comes after the
[1:20:27] feeling what does it produce does it
[1:20:30] give you real Faith does it give you
[1:20:32] real confidence amen does it give you a
[1:20:34] real like yes Lord you are you are
[1:20:36] Supreme you're awesome and I'm your
[1:20:38] child there we go let's just jump off
[1:20:40] that sigue come back on so but you know
[1:20:44] so the so the T spies were not
[1:20:48] convinced and they even got to a point
[1:20:50] they said let us make a captain and let
[1:20:52] us return unto Egypt see they would
[1:20:55] rather live as slaves you got to think
[1:20:57] about this they'd rather live as slaves
[1:20:59] being oppressed than live free in their
[1:21:01] own land so they wanted this because
[1:21:04] they considered it safe to be a slave
[1:21:07] because that's where they are born this
[1:21:08] is what I'm used to this is the family
[1:21:11] Dynamic this is my mindset I'm used to
[1:21:13] being a pessimist the glass is always
[1:21:15] half
[1:21:16] empty not if I'm drinking it's half full
[1:21:20] Hallelujah no everything's half full we
[1:21:22] should be positive right won the Lord
[1:21:25] we're on our way to heaven shouting
[1:21:27] Victory I don't feel very Victorious but
[1:21:30] he's Victorious hallelujah amen but you
[1:21:32] see so they consider people consider it
[1:21:34] safe you know no safety is not in Egypt
[1:21:38] safety there's no safety in depression
[1:21:40] there's no safety in anxiety there's no
[1:21:43] safety in stress there's no safety in
[1:21:45] double mindness that is not people think
[1:21:47] it's safe because they're used to it
[1:21:48] we're going to break out of our safety
[1:21:50] zone where all things are possible amen
[1:21:53] we're going to you know so see they were
[1:21:55] used to see people get used to besetting
[1:21:57] sin family problems they think that it
[1:21:59] has to go on that way forever but no it
[1:22:02] doesn't amen see they would say well it
[1:22:06] was safer for us in
[1:22:08] Egypt being used being abused our sons
[1:22:12] being fed to the crocodiles all these
[1:22:14] things see they forgot their anguish of
[1:22:17] death of their babies and their cry to
[1:22:20] be delivered and they said we'd rather
[1:22:22] live this way than be free
[1:22:25] free friends that's not our
[1:22:28] portion if you think well this is just
[1:22:30] how I am I Was Born This Way quoting
[1:22:33] Lady Gaga that means she's crazy I was
[1:22:36] born this way that's why we need to be
[1:22:38] born again amen that's why we need to
[1:22:40] become a new creature that's why we've
[1:22:42] got to realize if you have had a real
[1:22:43] experience with God you're not your old
[1:22:45] man anymore stop letting the old man
[1:22:47] rule you amen no no he's dead and
[1:22:49] crucified I mean you're not you whatever
[1:22:51] your surname is that's not you who you
[1:22:53] are
[1:22:55] sure my last name is gloin but I'm a Son
[1:22:57] of God I thank God for my family all
[1:23:00] those things but that that is not my
[1:23:02] identity amen that is not who I am I am
[1:23:05] this right this is me amen not my not my
[1:23:09] identity and we're going to realize that
[1:23:11] the old man he's gone do not
[1:23:13] resuscitate leave him alone don't feed
[1:23:16] the animal leave him alone right so
[1:23:18] don't Panda to this flesh it won't help
[1:23:21] you none did it help you before you
[1:23:23] became a Christian no it caused us to
[1:23:25] get into a lot of
[1:23:26] trouble but Jesus brought us out I mean
[1:23:29] so why not focus on the one that brought
[1:23:31] you out as opposed to the one that
[1:23:33] caused you a lot of trouble amen so
[1:23:35] don't Pander to the flesh no feed the
[1:23:37] spirits what do you mean by pandering to
[1:23:38] the flesh this flesh loves salt water
[1:23:41] this flesh now thrives is not the right
[1:23:44] word but but it's addicted to salt water
[1:23:48] right but the spirit is addicted to
[1:23:49] fresh water so the one you feed is the
[1:23:52] one that's going to dominate your life
[1:23:54] amen so I'm just going to drink on good
[1:23:56] old fresh Holy Ghost
[1:23:58] water amen hallelujah well what if it
[1:24:01] overflows what if you can't contain your
[1:24:02] stomach will
[1:24:04] stretch Hallelujah hey and if it bubbles
[1:24:07] out it's a good thing it'll bubble out
[1:24:08] onto someone else amen they'll start
[1:24:10] having a fresh drink too hallelujah
[1:24:13] hallelujah hope we're all okay this
[1:24:15] morning amen so don't don't be caught
[1:24:18] don't say well it was safer back
[1:24:20] somewhere else no keep walking with God
[1:24:23] amen amen but they weren't see they
[1:24:25] weren't
[1:24:26] convinced in here like Caleb and Joshua
[1:24:29] were see but the two that went over into
[1:24:31] the promised land and brought back the
[1:24:32] evidence that it was a goodly land now I
[1:24:34] just want to go back to that quickly so
[1:24:35] I just skipped my mind the evidence of
[1:24:37] the land did not convince them the
[1:24:40] anointing of God did not convince them
[1:24:43] everyone can enjoy see they all enjoyed
[1:24:45] the grapes they all enjoyed what they
[1:24:47] you know the things they ate right just
[1:24:50] like everyone enjoys the holy ghost
[1:24:51] moving I trust you do amen but that just
[1:24:54] the anointing did not convince them no
[1:24:57] Caleb and Joshua were convinced by the
[1:24:59] revelation of the word right that's what
[1:25:03] convinced them God has brought us out
[1:25:05] God is going to take us in amen so we
[1:25:08] can all be under the anointing but don't
[1:25:09] let just the anointing convince you let
[1:25:11] it be the word amen that you're part of
[1:25:13] the promise I trust this came out right
[1:25:15] see they were convinced see that's why
[1:25:17] how can 12 go in and 10 come out with an
[1:25:20] evil report when all 12 saw the same
[1:25:22] thing all eight the same grapes also saw
[1:25:25] the same things see Caleb and Joshua did
[1:25:28] not deny the Giants or the cities or
[1:25:30] they didn't deny any of the things they
[1:25:31] said what those men said was true up to
[1:25:33] a point and the point that they differed
[1:25:36] on was 10 said they can't take it two
[1:25:38] said they could why the two were
[1:25:40] convinced in here that God was going to
[1:25:42] do it for them the other 10 were just
[1:25:44] convinced in here and when you're
[1:25:45] convinced in here what you see will
[1:25:47] change if you're convinced or not that's
[1:25:50] why we walk by faith and not by sight
[1:25:52] see
[1:25:55] praise the Lord now but the two that
[1:25:56] went over into the promised land and
[1:25:57] brought back the evidence that it was a
[1:25:58] goodly land and we were more than able
[1:26:00] to make it because it was God's promise
[1:26:02] and instead of the people going on
[1:26:04] receiving the Holy Ghost speaking with
[1:26:05] tongues receiving the power of God the
[1:26:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh signs
[1:26:09] wonders Miracles they felt that it would
[1:26:10] break down their tradition of Doctrine
[1:26:12] so in other words it would break down
[1:26:14] their comfort zone
[1:26:16] yes and what happened to it they
[1:26:18] perished in the land that's right but
[1:26:19] the Believers the Caleb and Joshua
[1:26:21] outfit they were fully convinced amen
[1:26:24] that that was going that was going on to
[1:26:26] the promise they moved on over into the
[1:26:28] land they took the land they settled
[1:26:29] down in the land as a possession and we
[1:26:31] never stop at being justified at
[1:26:33] justification sanctification let's go on
[1:26:35] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's
[1:26:37] not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:26:39] being baptized let's not stop because he
[1:26:41] cleaned us up from a life of sin but now
[1:26:43] we pressed on into a position to a
[1:26:46] promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:48] for Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:49] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:26:51] children to them that are far off even
[1:26:52] as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:26:55] call are you convinced about it amen
[1:26:58] let's let's not just stop let's go all
[1:27:00] the way in amen every promise belongs to
[1:27:03] you and I whatever Giant's on there he's
[1:27:05] coming off I mean whatever whatever
[1:27:07] stronghold of the enemy that thing's
[1:27:09] being bulldozed we're going to live on
[1:27:10] that possession amen when the devil says
[1:27:12] healing is not for you you bulldo him
[1:27:14] away you say no my God has promised me I
[1:27:17] am convinced that he's my healer I'm
[1:27:19] convinced he's my savior I'm convinced
[1:27:21] he's my family savior amen we've to be
[1:27:24] convinced he's our Refugee and strength

[1:27:27] trouble who do you turn to in a time of
[1:27:29] trouble just like brother Isaac you know

[1:28:16] that God was his hiding place I mean
[1:28:18] more than the caves of Abdul or
[1:28:20] somewhere else no God was his hiding
[1:28:22] place amen I and and thou shalt preserve
[1:28:25] me from trouble he was convinced God was
[1:28:28] going to preserve him why is that
[1:28:29] because God told him he's going to be
[1:28:31] king amen he was going to end up on the
[1:28:33] throne and David was convinced that God
[1:28:35] would get him there are we convinced the
[1:28:38] Lord's going to change our bodies I mean
[1:28:40] are we convinced that this Holy Ghost
[1:28:42] we've received is the Holy Ghost

[1:29:04] with the saving strength of his right
[1:29:06] hand that's just power punch right there
[1:29:08] some trust in chariots and summon horses
[1:29:10] but we will remember the name of the
[1:29:12] Lord Our God so David is saying well
[1:29:15] some are convinced chariots will help
[1:29:16] them some are convinced horses will help
[1:29:18] them but I'm convinced amen the name of
[1:29:21] that our God is a strong tower amen I
[1:29:23] convinced that he will save his anointed

[1:29:37] don't you know the seraphim there that
[1:29:39] that Isaiah saw around the throne crying
[1:29:41] out holy holy holy they do it because
[1:29:43] they're built to do it yes there's no
[1:29:45] heart in it but you and I can cry out
[1:29:48] the same thing holy holy holy and
[1:29:50] because of he's redeemed me he saved me
[1:29:52] your heart is completely in in your
[1:29:54] worship and that's what God is looking
[1:29:56] for are you convinced he has redeemed
[1:29:58] you amen hallelujah amen God never
[1:30:01] changes his program we can rest solemnly
[1:30:03] on what God says the first time
[1:30:05] Hallelujah he never has to stay with
[1:30:08] that he I mean he ever sorry has to stay
[1:30:10] with that he cannot he cannot and never
[1:30:13] did at any time change it because if he
[1:30:14] does then he is infinite like we are he
[1:30:17] makes mistakes he has to apologize and
[1:30:19] go back but he is the source of all
[1:30:21] wisdom source of all power he's infinite
[1:30:23] ipresent om omnicient omnipotent see
[1:30:26] he's just he's God if he isn't all those
[1:30:29] things then he isn't God but he has to
[1:30:31] be that to be God are you
[1:30:34] convinced amen I'm convinced he's the

[1:30:43] I don't need any any other source amen
[1:30:47] hallelujah amen you know people get
[1:30:49] ready uh better convinced in 10 days
[1:30:52] this is speak about the upper room
[1:30:54] then we can get them in 10 years when
[1:30:56] our seminaries come out they're still
[1:30:57] not convinced because they hold their
[1:30:59] tradition injected into them but when
[1:31:01] they waited on God for 10 days they were
[1:31:03] certainly convinced then they certainly
[1:31:05] was convinced some of them at Pentecost
[1:31:07] could not even write their own name but
[1:31:09] they were convinced that it was God Amen
[1:31:11] they knew it was they would die for the
[1:31:13] thing they knew it was God they were
[1:31:15] convinced yeah they knew it was God
[1:31:17] that's why Peter could stand up he
[1:31:19] didn't say I think this is that which
[1:31:20] prophet you know you the prophet Joel
[1:31:22] said he said this is that the Prophet
[1:31:24] Joel said I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:31:26] All Flesh he was convinced that was God
[1:31:28] he was convinced that now God lived in
[1:31:30] them amen they were thoroughly convinced
[1:31:33] that when Jesus said I'll send the
[1:31:34] promise of the comforter I will not
[1:31:35] leave you comfortless I'll come to you
[1:31:37] he was convinced that that happened
[1:31:39] there on the day of Pentecost amen they
[1:31:41] were thoroughly
[1:31:43] convinced amen they became thoroughly
[1:31:45] convinced that he was all they needed
[1:31:49] are you thoroughly and and this is
[1:31:50] really the nutshell this is what I read
[1:31:52] last night and it really gripped me are
[1:31:54] you thoroughly convinced that he's all
[1:31:56] you need amen Caleb and Joshua are
[1:31:59] thoroughly convinced all we need is his
[1:32:00] leadership he will lead us to the
[1:32:02] promised land he'll lead us to our
[1:32:03] inheritance he'll take us out of Egypt
[1:32:05] they were thoroughly convinced am me
[1:32:07] when Joshua came to the walls of Jericho
[1:32:10] when the a when the captain of the Angel
[1:32:11] you know the captain of the Lord's host
[1:32:13] came to him said you know when Joshua
[1:32:15] said are you for us or against us and
[1:32:17] and and the captain of the host of the
[1:32:19] Lord said no but I come to take over I
[1:32:21] come as the captain of the host of the
[1:32:22] Lord Joshua became thoroughly convinced
[1:32:25] that the one that was leading Moses was
[1:32:27] now leading him am mean and had now come
[1:32:30] to take over the entire campaign not
[1:32:32] just taking Jericho the entire campaign
[1:32:35] are you thoroughly convinced that your
[1:32:37] entire campaign Walking with God he's
[1:32:39] got it he's got the battle plans he
[1:32:42] knows how to fight the battle he knows
[1:32:43] what to do are you thoroughly convinced
[1:32:45] I mean because Joshua became thoroughly
[1:32:47] convinced that he was all he needed amen
[1:32:51] amen and I trust that we can look in the
[1:32:52] word of God and say this is all we need
[1:32:55] amen this message God has sent are you
[1:32:57] convinced that it's God's word are you
[1:32:59] convinced it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:33:01] Christ are you convinced it's God
[1:33:02] revealing himself in these end times
[1:33:04] amen then they were convinced that it
[1:33:06] was sufficient to take care of them are
[1:33:09] you convinced God is sufficient to take
[1:33:11] care of you Amen brother BR he preached
[1:33:14] the most was Jehovah Gyra the Lord
[1:33:17] himself will provide Hallelujah are you
[1:33:20] convinced he will provide for your needs
[1:33:22] are you convinced that he will keep you
[1:33:24] together are you convinced he'll keep
[1:33:25] your are you convinced he'll save your
[1:33:27] family are you convinced it doesn't
[1:33:29] matter where they go you see the
[1:33:30] prodical sons parents became
[1:33:33] convinced he's out of he's out of his
[1:33:35] inheritance he's gone to a Strange Land
[1:33:37] but I'm convinced that our God is more
[1:33:40] than if God you know imagine if they're
[1:33:42] having conversation maybe his wife's all
[1:33:43] upset he would have been brokenhearted
[1:33:45] too there goes his son there goes a
[1:33:48] second born son off into the world there
[1:33:50] he would have been brokenhearted but
[1:33:51] maybe he just open the scripture and he
[1:33:54] read there in Exodus I've heard the
[1:33:56] cries of my people I've come down to
[1:33:58] deliver them and Mary said you know what
[1:34:00] honey what's that you know if God can
[1:34:04] bring out our Forbe out of Egypt if he
[1:34:07] can bring them out can not get our son
[1:34:09] back can he not go canot that same Angel
[1:34:12] of the Lord honey I'm convinced amen we
[1:34:14] are God's covenant people I am convinced
[1:34:17] that our God is still alive I'm
[1:34:19] convinced he's still a deliverer I'm
[1:34:21] convinced he's the same and if God can
[1:34:23] go into Egypt and get our forbears out
[1:34:24] can he not go to where our son is gone
[1:34:27] and get him back what they became
[1:34:29] convinced Hallelujah they became
[1:34:31] convinced and what they begin to do take
[1:34:33] the promise of God and quote it back to
[1:34:35] him I mean they became convinced when it
[1:34:37] says in Isaiah that I'll put my word in
[1:34:39] the mouth of thy seed and thy seed seed
[1:34:41] henceforth forever they were convinced
[1:34:43] that promise was theirs and they began
[1:34:45] to quote it back to God hallelujah what
[1:34:48] they became convinced I remember when I
[1:34:50] first heard brother Brown preaching I
[1:34:51] was
[1:34:52] a Homebrew making lost student in the
[1:34:55] world I heard him preach about the Seal
[1:34:57] of God I opened my Bible that I had went
[1:34:59] to Acts chapter 2 3839 I said Lord this
[1:35:03] is your promis amen you said if I do
[1:35:06] this you're going to give me the Holy
[1:35:07] Ghost I've been baptized but I don't
[1:35:08] know what repentance is you got to lead
[1:35:10] me to bapt I you got to lead me to
[1:35:11] repentance This Promise is mine I became
[1:35:14] convinced that it was my promise amen
[1:35:16] not in here but in here amen hey it took
[1:35:19] a couple of years I you had to overcome
[1:35:21] peer pressure and surrender and all
[1:35:22] these things but I was convinced and me
[1:35:25] being convinced took me through a lot of
[1:35:26] disappointments till I met that until I
[1:35:28] met him and he changed my life I mean
[1:35:30] just like Peter when he said Thou Art
[1:35:32] the Christ the son of the Living God he
[1:35:33] was convinced in his heart I mean he
[1:35:35] would stand there and nearly 5,000
[1:35:37] people would leave after Jesus preached
[1:35:38] one meeting and then he turned Jesus
[1:35:40] turned to his disciples will you go also
[1:35:43] but then Peter would say where shall we
[1:35:45] go thou have the words of eternal life
[1:35:47] he was convinced am mean this was more
[1:35:49] than a Healing Ministry more than a
[1:35:50] prophetic Ministry it was the word of
[1:35:52] God being manifested he was convinced
[1:35:54] and that held him through his denying
[1:35:57] the Lord through trying to stop see you
[1:35:59] know in Gethsemane he was trying to stop
[1:36:01] the word being fulfilled when he when he
[1:36:04] cut the servant's ear off you know the
[1:36:06] high priest servant he was trying to
[1:36:07] stop the word being fulfilled through
[1:36:09] those disappoints denying the Lord three
[1:36:11] times all those things him being
[1:36:12] convinced took him through those things
[1:36:14] carried him through why because it was a
[1:36:16] God given he was convinced by God and
[1:36:18] not by man
[1:36:21] hallelujah amen are you convinced that
[1:36:23] he is way of Escape in every Temptation
