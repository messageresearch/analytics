hallelujah well it's good to be here amen i'm sure you all agree that it is good to be in the house of the lord this evening thank you musicians amen i don't know what happened to the music there but it just went what happened did it just stop or i heard this like and then it was just like oh where did the music go well praise the lord it was my cue hallelujah amen well we had a good time in the weekend and and the lord really blessed the the weekend meetings and it was just a real privilege to be there and see how the lord could knit lives together and and repair people's relationships and repair law people's relationships with him and with each other and you know i really i really feel to give god a hand clip of praise for what he's done and amen and what he's doing in our lives and so tonight i just ask you like i just prayed if you're seven pull on god ask him to speak to you if you're 17 pull on god and ask him to speak to you if you're 57 or 67 or 77 i don't know what the age range is but you we have to pull we have to say lord i need something tonight. otherwise you'll sit there and you'll think why is it that these sermons are always not relevant to me or why is this what is going on here lord and and i just i can encourage you now if you really just if you if you ask the lord he will speak to you it's very simple and it's a very supernatural event that's taking place amen while we're standing i just want to invite your attention to jude chapter one which is the only chapter in jude verse 20 to 23. and i want to speak this evening on a subject called fight back or fight first you choose you will either react or you'll fight first hallelujah amen and it says here but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost so i just want to just speak that again just so that it sounds verse 20. but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves this is all connected now it's not i mean these verses but this is all one thing keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life full stop and of some have compassion making a difference amen i believe i'm looking at a difference making people you can make a difference amen you can make a difference hallelujah and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh amen may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah amen hallelujah proverbs 21 31 and it says here the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the lord amen i like that balance here because tonight we're going to talk about fighting and and and and and and whether you fight back as a reaction when the devils hit you from behind because you somehow got blindsided and we get blindsided from time to time okay that happens because sometimes we get busy and all of a sudden boom and it's hit and it's too late you've got to now get up and work your way out of it by the lord's grace you know he pulls us up he gives us grace amen or fight first amen hallelujah we are in a time and you know i'll get to it but i just want to say before we go any further we're in a time of great calamity now right now in new zealand we're just living it up man we're living a dream we're having it all easy we can go and earn money we can have a good job we can see our friends and we can worship god how we want to worship god and according to the revelation of this message uh and and all the way out there you can go and you can buy nice things you can eat your fill of the tree of knowledge of good and evil tonight and today and all over the time in your life right now but let me tell you that underneath it all well and and maybe some of you are seeing this and some of you are not seeing this but underneath it all is it's just a veneer and underneath it all is a great calamity and a great emergency is dawning upon us it's emerging and it's change it's going to change everything that you think everything that you think of life right now is going to drastically change i'm not trying to put fear on you but i just want you to really search your heart with god and say lord what is he talking about what does he mean this veneer what is this tiny you know what a veneer is it's like this or you know like you can make this nice furniture you know and it's real beautiful and it's like some african mahogany you know and uh and and if it's just a veneer it's just one mil thick it's just and underneath is mdf or chipboard you know it's like what i tell you a story you know i had this table when i grew up it was my parents table and i grew up with a statement i thought it was mahogany or some wood and it was good wood you know i thought man this is a good table good solid table board in the 80s you know and you know only i think only humans came out that was the only thing good that came out of the 80s you know is people everything else kind of just has got a lot to answer for but this table this table was just nice and i was like you know what i'm going to sand this so i begin to give this table a trial you know i'm like sanding it back because you know i wanted to craft something beautiful out of this table and i'm standing this table and all of a sudden appearing underneath me there's these blobs these like light brown circles and i'm like what is going on here what is this and i was like no all of my life i thought this was a solid mahogany table it was veneer it was veneer and i ruined the thing amen we used it anyway for a few years until we outgrew it because you know we just used that fellowship and it was like we could get eight people seven people at the table and it was always like 20 people there you know i was like we needed a bigger table so we got rid of that but the point i'm meaning is here is that's what this world is this world may look good and it may provide for you and the tree of knowledge provides for you right now because you go work you earn money and you go and invest into the tree of knowledge of good and evil you invest into the system of lucifer and hey i'm not saying it's wrong we have to live and plant our potatoes and do all those things you invest into that you're actually buying into an economy of the devil it's his economy it's his masterpiece it's his ideas this is what he foresaw before way back when he had the big fight with michael way back way way back before the foundation of the world this was his idea and you're seeing it but all it is is just a facade all it is is this thing that makes you feel good and distracts you and gives you all these things to do young children it gives you sports it gives you all of these things in schools and school friends and school and all that stuff but it's just a veneer it's one millimeter thick if you begin to sand that veneer that looks so good this life this world out there all of these activities that's going on all of the rugby all of the soccer all of these things that are so fun and so good you begin to sand that down and all of a sudden there's nothing absolutely nothing there because as soon as you know it before you know it it's going to disappear and you won't be allowed to partake in it we'll be ostracized we'll be given all these things are going to change and so what we're seeing right now is you know it says peace and safety it says and and and and the lord delayeth is coming it might be a hundred years but you see the spirit of god i believe is putting an urgency forward to us to have an expectation young ones whether you're six seven eight ten whatever an expectation this evening that he could come tomorrow he could come tomorrow i know there's these movies and things that need to be made but you know what he can come tomorrow you know that and when you least expect it the son of man cometh right so we need to be ready we need to let's not put off tomorrow what we can have today because then when you have him then he he is like you know a watch you know has all of the springs and all of the things inside it but it has a main spring and that main spring in the watch is the main thing that causes everything in that watch to come together a human being without the holy ghost has no mainspring but when the mainspring comes down it puts a mainstream the holy ghost comes down it puts that very cog within your life to make everything work it doesn't take away your trials it doesn't take away your suffering but it makes everything work it brings you into balance it brings you into a a life that is happy so that when you go and do those things and you're still sowing into the tree of knowledge for a time and season it's going to change but for now you'll be sowing into it so now you've got to get a job and you've got to take that money where does that money come from it doesn't come from god but we're utilizing it's a tool you know and where you put money you don't put money all the way up here in your life it's not important money is not important it's necessary but it's a tool and god gave you the blessing of abraham to rule over it not for money to rule over you not for you to get all funny about money excuse the rhyme but not for you to get you know some people get so strange about money and as soon as money comes into the picture it's like they get all weird and oh i'm so scared of you know and you don't want to show anybody it's like well who cares it's just money it's just a tool it's just a tool and god said you're the royal seed of abraham you don't have to worry about finances you don't have to be funny about it it's just nothing if you just serve god and put him first all the provision will come everything will come he provided this for your freedom so you could worship so that you could redeem the time and and live a life of worship and peace in the midst of all of this turmoil the devil doesn't want that that you know those horse riders how that black horse rider i think we listened to a while back he was this one that had the balances in his hand and he began to control people with money and suck all the money of the world that's an anointing of the devil and that anointing hasn't gone he wants to put pressure on people he wants to pressure you with finances he wants you to worry about them he wants you to have fear and it will deactivate your faith if you begin to worry about it but if you you know but in all simplicity right now if you just say i just you know i'm just going to be diligent with my things and lord i put you first lord i know you'll provide you begin to sow into the kingdom of god you'll never have to worry about finances again i can testify this is my life i'm a living testimony of such things amen he's provided for me everything hallelujah amen well praise god that was completely in another direction but anyway this is all about a fight you know sometimes you've got to expose the devil right and that's that's just one veneer of the devil one veneer that's money it's a big thing you know it's this and it can be it can be a you know like a mountain out of a mohu what do you call it like when you just make something so big exacerbated but it's not really a big issue if as a son of god as a child and a seed of abraham hallelujah proverbs 21 31 says the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the lord you know this word safety it means rescue or or or a national deliverance or a individual deliverance a spiritual deliverance the horse is prepared until the day of battle you must prepare for the calamity that's here for the emergency that's coming you know i preached up to brother elrey's and i decla you know i felt on my heart to declare an emergency because in an emergency special powers are given to the people the controllers hello you are controllers you have been called with a dominion over sin over this world over darkness over yourself the old nature and in a time of emergency a special power comes upon the people to inaugurate you to to to give you what is activated it's already in you it's like these world governments and all of those people in the natural you know without an emergency on man they want to change laws they have opinions they have ideas they have satanic ideologies that are controlling them and they would love to be able to change law and then what happens is that many countries do it they declare an emergency and they live in a state of emergency and then they just change laws because they have a power to change laws in the middle of normal life they just declare an emergency and all of a sudden they begin to change laws and it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be you know okayed by the people and have big government meetings they just say we're going to do this because in the idea of safety of the people but how much more a people that realize what time we're in it will bring you to a desperation it will bring you to an alertness a sobriety in this hour to realize that sitting back and just warming a pew is just not enough now hallelujah that's just not enough amen this is the time to rise up this is a time to say lord what am i here for well what is my calling what is my purpose what have you brought me here on this earth young one right now because you see you might not get old so do something for god now hallelujah you get down on your knees and say lord will you sit on your bed at night and you say lord that brother said that i should pray and ask you what is my life for i can guarantee you if you really mean that before god he will come to you he will speak to you he will tell you something that you need to know hallelujah safety deliverance help safety salvation victory so there's a people that would see through the veneer and declare this that this power begins to emerge in this time of emergency a power emerges because of the pressure because of the things that come on a great squeeze would come on a people and it would cause something to emerge from that squeeze and that's what an emergency is something trouble strikes or war strikes or a calamity strikes and it presses people it presses you and it reveals all the good that's in you it reveals the good things it reveals what you really are amen are you with me fight back or fight first now i want to just show you something and those that you of you that read the news especially the middle east news you probably already know this but i just want to invite your attention to something that is quite significant and we know that israel types the bride natural and to spiritual and when you see something going on in the state of israel and you see attacks coming on and you see an escalation you can rest assured that there's an escalation happening in the bride you can rest assured you can mark my words tonight that when you see a calamity striking and when you see something changing there you can mark my words tonight that something's changing something is changing in your midst tonight there is a pressure coming on there is an oncoming storm and it may look really good and the devil is going to make trees going to do his best to hide it until it's too late he's going to turn up that heat slowly until it's boiling and if it's too late the frog dies who knows the analogy now you don't want to be that frog who knows that story do the children know that story how if you put a frog in cold water and you turn that water on slowly and slowly and bring it to the boil the frog will cook but if you put the frog in boiling water it will jump straight out the devil's not that stupid i mean he's dumb but he's not that stupid he's going to try and connive and trick and he's going to slowly turn it up until it's too late so i'm telling you now rise up out of your comfort come away from your comfort zones tonight for it is a time of an emergency there is a pressure coming there's a storm coming and it's time for you to rise up out of your comfort zones it's time for you to get down serious with the lord and say lord what is going on lord let me see what's my purpose lord what am i doing here lord tune me calibrate me make me lord ready i don't i want to i want to hear the voice of god for my hour i want to hear what he's speaking what the spirit would say to the church this evening amen hallelujah a senior leuked minister on saturday this is a report said israel would preemptively strike hamas terror group in gaza when it becomes apparent it's when it becomes apparent it's restocking its rocket arsenal and is and spent gearing up to fire at israel as he laid out what he described as the jewish state's new security doctrine we cannot wait he says for rocket fire to respond to gaza said saki hanabi in an interview with channel 13 from now on he said the terror groups re-armament and preparations to fire rockets rather than the actual firing is cause for israeli strikes on military targets in gaza this he this is the guy speaking aces this is a total change of the equation we've never done this so you can see now there is a great change happening in the natural bride there's a great change happening they've changed their approach now they're not going to wait for the enemy to strike at them they're going to watch the enemy they're going to have discernment they're going to begin to discern the antichrist spirit in their midst can you discern the antichrist spirit shekinah tabernacle can you see the devil operating around you can you discern what he's doing amongst you when he begins to gossip when people begin to talk and they say things to try and destroy a character can you see it and can you withstand it because that is one of the antichrist spirits greatest tools to try and break down fellowship because it's god's love that will bring the fruit will bring the fellowship will bring the holy ghost on the scene in your life and in the church can you see it there is a discernment that is coming and if we look at the technological advancement of israel in this hour and you can see them begin to have a reconnaissance and an espionage and all those funny french words upon the upon the enemy you see they do all that they can see it all happening and it's like well they just know where that one is and that one is they just know the whole thing and it must really make the enemy mad because they just know where all the enemies are hiding they know all the stuff why they've got a discernment they've got technology and in the countdown the prophet brought a a principle to us that as the technology of the tree of knowledge begins to unfold and manifest in the earth and he said watch israel god's timepiece you can see a development there is a development going on there's a development happening in the technology of israel's discernment to be able to preempt the strike of the enemy to begin to discern the antichrist spirit so that he becomes powerless against them are you with me do you understand that this is being released because a prophet in 1962 in the church age book whenever it was written somewhere around there he said that that same thing would be given to the bride and the devil would be torn down from his kingdom he would be torn down from his position he would be torn down from his ability in the church all of his things that he thought he had and try and rise up and try and be the complex that you worship will try and be the problem that governs your life it's no longer for you you don't have to have a complex that governs your life anymore you don't have to have these things that hinder your fellowship or make it hard for you to talk or be friendly you don't have to have that anymore because god says i will break the yoke of the enemy from off your shoulders and release you from those burdens hallelujah hallelujah nahum 1 13 it says for now will i break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy bonds in thunder hallelujah for now i will break his yoke from off thee who wants to take this for themself does anyone want to take this take it take it it's yours i will burst thy bonds and thunder break them that's the power of his blood hallelujah you know that you know you go through the old testament you see how god would deliver israel and he'd do these things but remember it happens and it's for you hallelujah it's for you first yeah all the natural kingdom in the natural land hello what are you conquering it's a kingdom within jesus said you can't observe this kingdom he was talking about it's the kingdom of the holy ghost inside you and it's time to conquer it's time for you to own the scriptures that is pertaining to you the youth heard brother adrian preach and he said find yourself in the bible find yourself in a character and say lord you did it for her you'll do it for me lord you did it for him you'll do it for me you're connected to the word and god will honor it because your faith activates the word hallelujah it gives you a contact amen i need to drink water hallelujah amen are we together amen so you see israel got sick of fighting back they don't want to fight back no more who's getting sick of fighting back getting sick of just reacting to the devil you know before you just find yourself in it and it's like you just get bashed around too much but you know see there's gonna come a time when you say no more no more there's a promise over my life that i will discern the antichrist spirit and he will be powerless against me and i'm encouraging you tonight and especially as we pray that god will give you spiritual prayer it says there i want to read that again but you beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep it one there's a comma there but make it it's connected how do you build yourself up on your most hold your most holy faith it's praying in the holy ghost hallelujah i know we all say prayers but do we pray you know really i'm not trying to condemn anybody because you see it you have to really pray there's a difference between saying a prayer and praying and really praying in the holy ghost hallelujah you know like the devil fights me big time of the prayer oh my all the resistance you can think of all of the thoughts and all of the flesh just begins to swirl around when i go to pray you know and oh my it's really hard i'm not saying it's going to be easy but i encourage you when you go to pray it's like an attitude just a lord you know i and you just begin to thank him and just be thankful it's not a big complicated thing and it's like it's just something takes place and god begins to take over hallelujah and you go from saying a prayer to praying in the holy ghost building yourself up on your most holy fate hallelujah building building taking land not just for yourself this is here pulling others out of the fire you know it's a great privilege and a joy to pull someone out of the fire there's people in the fire and there's people in the fire i'm not going to point at anybody but you know and people know when they're in a fire but that's what we're here for we are here hallelujah to pull each other out of fires and pull the people out by prayer by intercession by love expressed hallelujah amen hallelujah who's this devil anyway who is he he's a defeated being you know that we've heard this many times let's not keep it as a cliche or a catchphrase he's broken his back's broken he's a liar and i hate him i'm not going to entertain someone this being that i hate and many times we find ourselves entertaining or harboring a demon ideology or a complex or something that the devil uses in our life a complex is not a devil it's a tool that the devil uses it's a leverage that he uses to lever you into something that you don't want to do because of a hurt or a pain and you begin to act in a way that you don't want to act because something activates that but tonight i read that scripture name 1 13 take it just take it in simplicity and say lord promise to break these things off me amen isaiah 14 3 let's just we're going to just take a slight um journey here and i want you to think about bringing the devil down the devil has lost his position but he would seek to keep it he will seek to keep his position and the only way he can do it is by lying and even when he's got it it's a lie and it can be torn down like that tearing down strongholds and all these high things and a gate that exalts themselves against the knowledge of god principalities and powers and rulers of darkness where are you seated this evening far above it do you realize how far you are above it you have to reach down to stomp on the devil he's so far below so far down the only way he can come up higher is in your mind he begins to come up by a lie by a fiery dart and that fiery dart gets it's down there way down there way down there and you can stand on it but from there it begins to fire these things up and if you believe that you are exalting the devil up into your mind and you begin to entertain the devil and his thoughts and his processes and all of those things you're bringing him from out of his position which is down now when you think about bringing the devil down because what you're going to see here is how the devil's basically his testimony and you're going to see his end before he goes to the lake of fire and you'll see all of these things in isaiah 14 and we're going to read verse 3 to 7 and it says and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou was made to serve i underlined the lord shall give thee rest you know a prophecy because i'm speaking here but i think there are people watching as well but when this ch when we first you know when this church was in its initial stages and we were having a powerful prayer meeting and just crying out to god and there was a tongues and interpretation and the lord spoke and he said that if you remain humble i will draw my people into my rest and my word will go forth from this place so you can find rest in the promise that god specifically made for this region amen that his people could come and find rest and so if you have come and haven't found rest there is a real promise to you this evening that you can find rest tonight you can find rest to your soul the same god that stood there in matthew 11 and said come unto me all that you labor in a heavy laden and i will give you rest to your soul as the same god that came to stokes valley hallelujah and he's here tonight amen to say fine rest this is the purpose that you will cease from your works that you will cease from all your travail and labor in your own flesh trying this and trying that and turning over a new leaf and just over and over and under and out and then and then one day you begin to truly surrender and say lord if you spoke that that night in that prayer meeting then i believe it i'm going to receive that tonight i'm going to receive my rest i'm going to say lord oh hallelujah amen hallelujah this is not a lecture amen who believes that this is not a lecture we're having a you know this is a two-way thing and you know these things being spoken is for you to take and and make it yours you have to you can't just sit there and go man that's a good thought that just you know you just get full of knowledge but really it's got to be deeper it's gotta be more personal hallelujah so i encourage you tonight to take these things personally it says here that thou shalt take up this is verse 4 that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how has the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers he who smote the people in rough with a continual stroke over and over just beating the woman down beating her down beating the church down you know they keep rising up there'll be revival and then beat her down and beat them down i mean one day god says enough is enough and he said i would come in the fullness of my presence to break that cycle of revival and death and you are at the end of it you are at the end of the recite cycle of rival and death at the end of it this is your freedom call this is your jubilee call receive it receive it walk in it rise up into it hallelujah don't meddle with the things of the earth anymore rise up into your jubilee rise up into the one that has promised rest that has said i will draw my people maybe there's somebody that's feeling a drawing tonight that's not unrest that finds themselves tossed into and for tonight find your rest we're going to pray tonight there's prayer requests on my phone i'm going to read them out shortly but what about you what about you tonight hey man hallelujah because remember this and just keep this in mind as we read this think about bringing the devil down the lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth the whole earth is at rest and is quiet and they break forth into singing speaking of the millennium you could say the biggest scale the age or the dispensational level i hope you'll understand it's speaking of the millennium when jesus the king the real government the one that knows how to really rule a nation oh hallelujah but you see who's he will he's with his wife he's creating he's going to take that jerusalem that that center of god's earth and he's going to take all that disgusting evil religious layers upon layers of civilization and all of that he's going to kill it he's going to remove it he's going to get rid of it he's going to bring it back to the way it should be hallelujah he's going to convert the heart of the earth that earth is going to be converted that earth is going to receive fiery holy ghost hallelujah and you're going to be there and it's going to bring peace on the earth it's going to bring rest to the earth it's going to bring rejoicing hallelujah amen to the earth hallelujah but before that happens that bride that will help with that government amen you shall rule amen with christ amen he says if you're faithful in the giftings that he gives you and the talents and he begins to see fruit well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys and he says because you are faithful with these things i will make you rulers of many cities so what how did this woman hallelujah how did she get trained how did she learn how to govern the earth what was it that the lord allowed in her life to receive training over the to to rule over the earth it was the very same thing coming down into her earth into your life the holy ghost coming down so when i read this because this event of lucifer's fall and of lucifer losing his position of the devil losing his hold of those complexes going of all of that depression leaving of all the alcoholism and all of the drugs and all of the fear and all of the bondage and all of the satanic influence over your life all of those things that you inherited all of the demons that are troubling you in your flesh to be brought down to be broken completely to be brought down hallelujah by his anointing not your own works not your own travail not your own ability not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord hallelujah by his spirit not by your own effort because if it's your effort you haven't entered into rest to let the one that comes in hallelujah to your earth to bring you as a clay earth little living body into what i read here in isaiah 14 7 the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing your victory lies between faith and rejoicing your victory this evening lies between faith and rejoicing amen you see faith cometh by hearing the word and you believe unto salvation coming through calvary coming through that blood atonement into fellowship with god and then the next part is joy peace patience long suffering these fruits they're not lesser than faith they're of equal importance so you can be a stalwart faithful believer and have no joy you're you're actually not claiming a very big part of your inheritance you can have faith and you're going to heaven and you're saved but got no patience or peace they're just as important but joy joy and i speak on it every time because i think it's important joy is what you draw waters from the wells of salvation without joy you ain't drawing no strength you're just walking around morbid flat you you you might be sealed in your soul but your spirit and your flesh is just flat walking around depressed down oh my long hair and long face short hair and short temper fight a buzzsaw you know all these things because you're not bringing leadership in your own life and if you're going to rule and reign in an earth governing over normal people in real and flesh and governing and earth and cities then you need the lord is going to raise you up break those cycles in your life that's hindering you so that you can rule and reign over yourself and be a not a malevolent leader don't be a malevolent leader over your flesh and spirit don't rule with bondage and pharisaic style leadership but give your spirit and flesh something to live for amen die i'll tell you that it's all simple you just need to die to self self is the veil that hides the glory of god within your own heart because you may be sealed into the day of redemption and your soul is saved as save can be but your flesh is not dead and you're just hiding it all in and it's all just stuck in but tonight you can leave different tonight you can say there is a cycle breaker in here that can help me die to myself so i'm the selfishness and all about me it's just like gravity you know babies are but by the time they're conceived they're already sucking excuse the language but they're just sucking things in and the mother wants this and what's that and what's this and it's just drawing drawing drawing and more mark comes out crying and it's just all about that baby and they grow up and they're selfish children it's all about me and they don't care they're not thankful children be thankful it's true they don't realize what they've got they don't realize the preciousness of life until one day god comes to meet them and when you receive the new birth that selfishness gets destroyed that spirit that human spirit gets subdued and you begin to give hallelujah that's a general statement there are people around that are unconverted that are very unselfish but you see what i'm talking about it's just a principle of humanity the human flesh it's just selfish and it's that veil that will hide god within you it's that veil that will keep others from benefiting out of your life but if that veil just gets die killed dead on the altar elijah came what did he do he made an altar so that you can fall on it so that fire can come down and break it so that you can live and really live for others eternal life is living for others right amen so there has to be a death to self to break that flesh veil out of your own life so that it can release what the glory of god to conquer the enemy you can't destroy your own flesh because that'll be committing suicide you can't do that and you can't destroy your own spirit and end up in a great depression because that's what happens when you put yourself through torture and stress and all those things because you do things die to self let self die paul die daily what does that mean ask god i don't know i don't know how it's just something you have to do it's something you have to it's between you and the lord it's like a you know like a consecration it's a it's an attitude it's just it's fellowship that's the self hallelujah brother branham said desperation a lack of desperation is because of a lack of the love of god so if you find yourself just not really concerned you know it says you know because the prophet was us he said how do and um perfect faith he talked about developing having a real love for god and he says you've got to really meditate on what he's done for you you've got to begin to start thinking about your hero think of him differently he is your savior but make him your hero children make him your hero you know what he did he he took everything he took all of his own life he took it all he took all of our sins he took everything and he took it upon himself so that we could be his friend he's a hero i don't want to go down that route and preach too far on that but i just want you to realize that if if you find yourself lacking in his love or you feel like it's just like a duty your christianity becomes just a duty you know you honor god and you come to church it's an honor it's like a valiance you know you want to be a gallant soldier of christ and and yet that love isn't there my i said it makes a huge difference and you see now says begin to meditate upon the things he's done for you how he found you in darkness and he found you somewhere in some hole found you in some drug or some depression or some bottle some alcoholic condition he found you there but you're not there now who did that for you who took you from that somebody that loved you someone that really loves you that cares about your soul on the other hand there's another person that hates you who is this devil anyway this one that is you're called to tear down out of his lying position and make him real lying lying on the ground of your life don't have him lying in your head by lies have him lying on the ground underneath your feet that's where he belongs either way he's lying one is lying there or he's lying here amen i have to read this 14 because i just want to get to the next part and then we're going to pray it says here and we're going to skip from 7 down to 12 it says and i want you to realize as i've made this background with the millennium but actually in your own life you taste this now of a complete victory in your own earth a subduing of the flesh and the spirit by love by god's love by subduing you can't destroy it it's going to be destroyed it's going to be changed one day but at the moment you've got to live with these two parts of your own being which is unconverted and how you rule those is going to dictate how you would potentially rule in the millennium because the way your leadership style now if you take your leadership style in your own life and pattern it after some old school victorian rule way you've got another thing coming you have to rethink your leadership rethink the style because that's not the jesus style jesus style is perfect love jesus style is led by the spirit of god jesus style as the captain says how to release rahab completely different it's not logical but it's jesus it's his way it's his vision it's his prophecy it's him he gives you specific instruction and that's the the wisdom of god and as you walk that wisdom of god will begin to amalgamate in your own life and you will begin to have the wisdom of god and you'll have the mind of christ and it just merges into you and you begin to think like him and eventually one day everything you think will be the way he thinks and then he will release to you all the power of heaven and earth and you will be able to speak and it will happen and that stuff is already in you but he's you're just you're just not ready for it we're not ready but the thing is we're going through things to make us ready and we've been given promises to re to take that liar and bring him down how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer out of my life out of my mind out of my flesh how aren't thou fallen oh lucifer oh my i want you to make this personal son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation which stood weak in my life which did weaken my testimony which did weaken my fatherhood which did weaken my sisterhood which did weaken my friendship which should hinder me who was it lucifer how art thou fallen from heaven all of his influences all of these things that you inherited and behaviors that you saw a movie that impressed your life or some person said something to you and it's caused you to live under that bondage hard bondage but tonight you can be free tonight you can say no more devil because how art thou fallen oh lucifer hallelujah sorry i don't mean to shout but it just comes out like that for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god you are the stars he wants to exalt his throne above you that's his intention he wants to rule hell in your head it's the only way because he doesn't have a intrinsic position he doesn't have a given state he lost it he lost his first estate right and now the only way you can get back into a throne is by in the human mind only way but you have the power tonight little children if the devil gives you an evil thought you can say i cast you down in the name of jesus christ and he has to listen you can tear him down who likes to tear down the devil amen if he's annoying you you can cast him down and you know what we're called to cast the devil down we're called to cast him out cast him down kick him whatever you need to do to get rid of him because hey he's going to try he's going to continue to attempt to rule he doesn't want to lose he doesn't want to be under your feet do you think he likes lying down there and and being subservient to a just a regular joe you know just us average people no he doesn't like that and he'll do everything in his power to try and stop it for thou has said in my heart read there thrown above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee this is where i wanted to get to they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble is it him really all of a sudden the people realize that he's nothing after all these years of catering to him harbouring him in their lives worshiping inadvertently not realizing it these complexes that he's brought living under his depressions living under his addictions living under all this evil living under his his lies to to destroy teenage years you know i really believe that a teenager doesn't have to live under the bondage of the enemy with ups and downs and emotions this and that and everything they can be stable they can be full of joy they can be full of the holy ghost and serving god you know brother tim pruitt was a pastor at 14 years old leading people come on why because he got serious with god do you know samuel was probably leading israel at 14 years old i don't know but it wasn't him and it wasn't brother tim it was god it was god and i just pray right now lord help me i just pray if you're in that place it doesn't matter how old you are i may be cornering teenagers and i love you but we're all teenagers we're all going to be 18. we're all kind of 18 on the inside but i just want to say that in you is a calling in you a purpose a real divine purpose in you as officers of motherhood sisterhood some ministry some some some expression now when god gets a hold of that amen what you were born for and what you were made for and what fits you like a glove will come out of you and you will go i am here i've arrived thank you jesus and he begins to work and that's what you're made for and i just pray may god enable you i don't want to look at people but may god enable you you know sometimes i like you know because we know each other so well it's different when you're preaching in your home church because you know everybody so well you know and it's like yeah you don't want to look at people but you know you see there is i just pray god enable you know there's been a burden on my heart and i don't know how i mean it's only the lord that can do it but you see god is never going to override your will the lord is never going to like just come in and intrude but he wants to enable you he wants to take those gifts in your life and and operate through them so much that a 14 year old man boy teenager whatever can pastor a church you tell me who's 14 here is anyone 14 nine fourteen how josh you're 13 a so can you imagine josh maybe probably is three heads taller because he's probably going to grow three heads in this year but but can you imagine josh being our pastor this is this is what god can do god can do that and here we are you know thinking we're still young and just got to have a bit of good time but actually we've got to be serious we can have fun there's nothing wrong with having fun but there is a real seriousness that is required you know it says that we should um live a life that's worthy of the gospel of peace and it's not a legalistic thing that's as a love affair for thou it says here they shall see thee they that see they shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble and doubt that did you shake the kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness what do you do this is that one this guy you know this fallen angel he did all this this is the one that's taking family causing all sorts of crazy stuff to happen in your family to destroy your family taking your friends making your friends commit suicide you know doing all these evil things taking your joy making you depressed making you resort to human things to try and cope taking your children putting them in the world and destroy trying to destroy their lives trying to destroy your life trying to kill your body give you cancers who likes this guy does anyone like him or does everyone just completely just want to say i hate you devil this is you know the prophet says this and i want to read this and we're about to close he says here he says he says god rebuke that devil that's hindering you beautiful little girls may the power that raised jesus from the grave cast that thing away never bother you no more i say that on the authority of god's word you have to get angry at the devil this is the one that's trying to destroy your life that's trying to question your identity that's trying to take you from christianity that's trying to take your mind you know especially when you're going through your life change and you become you know from like the age of about 12 through to you know 17 18. you know he's going to try and take your identity and he's going to try and make you rethink who you are he's going to try and steal you from your position steal you from your families trying to make you upset and give you depression and and bring you down and all of us we are in the same boat this is the one and i want you to realize that tonight he is our enemy and tonight when we pray i want you to address him i want you to really address him for who he is and what he's done in your life just think about that and and and bring him down because you see what we read there is a reality that is a prophecy that this one our jesus who has come down in this generation to destroy the works of the devil completely so that you can be completely free let's stand can i have the musicians please let's sing all riser hallelujah just think this one that's caused all this trouble over all these years and back through your family generations has just been crushing your lineage and destroying and taking your loved ones to hell he's not going to take you to hell and he's not going to take your children to hell because the cycle breaker is here and now with this in mind i want you to pray tonight as we sing this song after we sing the song i want you to pray and i want you to really think about that this one that has destroyed all these generations and turned the world into a wilderness no more no more stand tonight with us we're going to pray together and we're going to bring our faith together and we're going to address that one remember what was read he was brought down he was fallen from heaven he was cast down from heaven and he's tried to rise up in humanity but he is being cast out of a bride because a bride has received a declaration of independence because a mighty angel came down with an open book in his hand and then that open book it said you are free you don't have to be under that anymore here is your inheritance saints here it says freedom to you here it says no more slavery here it says broken cycles here it says full and complete healing complete healing for everything all your tempers all your complexes all the darkness that would try and destroy your testimony all free it's all in here and he must obey it he must conform to the word hallelujah and so tonight i i i encourage you the same captain that said how to free rahab was the same captain that gave all the orders all the way through to the elect seat to give instruction and righteousness to show them exactly what to do in the situation and tonight you may be facing a situation to you may be facing something that you don't understand and you can't under figure it out but tonight god can come down and pray through you and give you instruction and maybe something's been spoken tonight that's given you instruction and you may be looking down the barrel of impossibilities but you are omnipotent and when you as an omnipotent man or a woman meet the omnipotence of god he will release the miraculous upon that impossible thing that you're looking at tonight so i want you to declare to the impossible thing that you think is impossible god specializes in that god will deliver you god will save your family he will save you he will redeem you out of it the things that you think is impossible do not be wary in well-doing for we have a declaration of independence we have a word that has come in this generation amen do you believe that hallelujah why let's play play softly i'll raise the hallelujah amen amen as you're playing i want you to listen to this quote as we see this pressure coming on it says the prophet says it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church now we are closer than it seems to be i don't know when but it's real real close amen who believes we're coming right into it amen hallelujah i may be building a platform for somebody else to step on i may be taken before that time i don't know and tonight as we pray out as we sing the song i just i just want you to open your heart to the lord and say lord you're that one that the prophet made a platform for lord i want you the one that spoke in that prayer meeting in stokes valley that said i will draw my people into my rest that one that one i want you to just to realize that he is the one that the prophet introduced [Music] we weren't just given a whole bunch of
