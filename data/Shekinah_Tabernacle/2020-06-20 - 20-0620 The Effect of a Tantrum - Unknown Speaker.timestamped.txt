[4:42] so I started to care about maybe 15
[4:46] leaves that we hopped in it was like hmm
[4:49] 25 20 reason me and um you know we
[4:55] complaining about how cold it is but
[4:56] Shannon said you know there was a time
[4:58] when people would have to go on a horse
[5:00] and buggy to church and this sort of
[5:03] temperature and no air conditioning no
[5:06] real insulation and I guess their
[5:09] clothes weren't the greatest but they
[5:11] weren't anyway so overall as a as a
[5:17] people we have it we have life
[5:18] reasonably easy and and you know it's
[5:21] always good to keep that in perspective
[5:24] so that our attitudes that become soft
[5:26] you know and we complain about having to
[5:28] graft but alien and the cold and go to
[5:29] church or anything like that you know
[5:30] it's good - it's good to keep them
[5:32] perspective can you hear me am I going
[5:34] okay that's good but you know price a
[5:36] little bit glad that hey these things
[5:39] just make it easier for us so we can we
[5:41] can more easily serve the Lord so now I
[5:50] see that the you know the principle of
[5:53] giving you shall receive you know you

[6:07] I think we reaped about what 1012

[49:02] after these things I just see if I can
[49:04] drive this okay good and it came to pass
[49:06] after these things that neighbor the
[49:09] jezreelite head of vineyard which was in
[49:11] Jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king
[49:14] of samaria and I have spoken to neighbor
[49:16] saying give me thy vineyard that I may
[49:18] have it for a garden of herbs because it
[49:21] is near unto my house and I'll give thee
[49:23] for it a bit of vineyard in it or if it
[49:26] seem good to thee I'll give thee the
[49:28] worth of it and money and they both said
[49:30] to Ahab the Lord forbid it means that I
[49:33] should give the inheritance of my
[49:35] father's unto thee and they have came
[49:37] into his house heavy and displeased
[49:40] because of the word which they both the
[49:42] jezreelite had spoken to him for he had
[49:44] said I'll not give me the inheritance of
[49:46] my father's and he laid him down upon
[49:48] his bed and turned away his face and
[49:50] would eat no bread no as we said last
[49:52] week he had an adult tantrum and but
[49:56] geez Abell his wife came to him and said
[49:57] unto him why is thy spirit so sad that
[50:00] thou eatest no bread and he said unto
[50:02] her because I spake unto name off the
[50:04] jezreelite and said unto him give me thy
[50:06] vineyard for money or else if it please
[50:08] the I will give thee another vineyard
[50:10] for it and he answered I will not give
[50:12] thee my vineyard and G's Abell his wife
[50:15] see and have dust they'll not govern the
[50:17] Kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread
[50:20] let thy heart be merry I will give thee
[50:23] the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite
[50:24] for she wrote letters and Ahab's name
[50:27] and sealed them with his seal and sent
[50:29] the letters unto the elders and to the
[50:31] nobles that were in the her city
[50:33] dwelling with Naboth and she wrote and
[50:35] the letters saying proclaimer fast and
[50:37] set now
[50:38] both on high among the people and set to
[50:41] men sons of Belial before him to be a
[50:44] witness against them saying thou does
[50:47] blaspheme God and the king and then
[50:48] carry him out and stone him that he may
[50:50] die and the men of his City when the
[50:53] elders and the nobles who were the
[50:54] inhabitants of a city that as Jezebel
[50:56] had said unto them and as it was written
[50:59] in the letters which she had sent unto
[51:01] them they proclaimed her fast and said
[51:04] neighbor thought high among the people
[51:05] and they came into men children of
[51:08] Belial and set before him and amenable
[51:10] are witnessed against him even against
[51:12] nay both and the presence of the people
[51:14] saying nay both did blaspheme God and
[51:16] the king then they carried him forth out
[51:18] of the city and stoned him with stones
[51:20] that he died then he sent that then they
[51:23] sent rather to Jesus about saying nay
[51:25] both the stoned and is dead and it came
[51:30] to pass when Jesus name both was stoned
[51:33] and was dead that G's Abell said to Ahab
[51:35] arise take possession of the vineyard of
[51:37] naboth the jezreelite which he refused
[51:40] to give thee for money for neighbor
[51:41] tha's not alive but did and it came to
[51:43] pass when Ahab heard that they both was
[51:45] dead that they have rose up to go down
[51:47] to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite
[51:49] to take position of it amen may the Lord
[51:52] bless his word you may have your seats
[51:53] this morning so I'd like to continue on
[51:56] from what I was speaking last Sunday
[51:58] about the effects of attention and going
[52:00] beyond going beyond a crush to real love
[52:04] but I want to take the other part of
[52:06] this about the effects of having a human
[52:08] or your adult tantrum and so we see here
[52:11] a hat because he would didn't have a
[52:13] good character he was you know he was
[52:15] kind of wishy-washy didn't didn't really
[52:17] you know there's times he repented but
[52:19] he didn't fully give his life to the
[52:20] Lord and he would you know he would be
[52:22] governed by govern basically but is
[52:25] about because we understand bit there's
[52:28] something if there's a void in someone's
[52:30] life something's going to fill it
[52:31] brother Brahim says we are full of
[52:33] something you can be full of nonsense
[52:35] you can be full of of gossip it can be
[52:37] full of malice you can be full of strife
[52:39] or you can be full of the Holy Ghost so
[52:41] so we're all full of something I mean
[52:43] even even just even if someone's just a
[52:45] bunch of nothing well they fall or
[52:46] nothing you know so so I have because he
[52:49] he didn't possess
[52:51] kingship properly he let other things
[52:53] kind of push him around but I want to
[52:55] show you now the effect of him having
[52:57] this tantrum now he desired his emotions
[53:00] led him the Word of God did not lead him
[53:02] so he saw the vineyard he says I want it
[53:05] so so so stir so his emotions as his
[53:07] desire was I want this vineyard he had
[53:10] bitter ones remember he said to neighbor
[53:11] I'll give you a better weather than this
[53:12] one so it wasn't the fact that that he
[53:14] didn't have better vineyards he just
[53:16] wanted that one
[53:17] but there's something when someone you
[53:20] know they they they want something but
[53:22] they can't get it and and is and these
[53:24] two options will happen one they will
[53:26] actually say okay fair enough or two
[53:28] they will just laughs after the thing
[53:30] and if they can get it they will get it
[53:32] and so I had because here's the King you
[53:34] know instead of accepting the fact that
[53:36] that that the the response that neighbor
[53:39] gave him was based on the word remember
[53:42] was wrong to to sell inherited and
[53:44] inheritance to to some other family had
[53:46] to stay within the family sown a boss
[53:48] was response was based on the Word of
[53:50] God and so if a ham was actually you
[53:53] know if he actually really accepted it
[53:55] he wouldn't have thrown a tantrum and go
[53:57] laid on the bed and cried to himself
[53:58] saying poor me why was me but because
[54:01] his emotions were leading him his
[54:03] emotions took control and because he
[54:05] threw that tantrum they both ended up
[54:08] dying right
[54:09] they both got killed but it also brought
[54:12] judgment upon his own self and not only
[54:15] himself but his entire family so we're
[54:18] going to be very careful how we react to
[54:19] things right it'll either it will either
[54:22] bring judgment or I'm gonna take the
[54:24] flip side of it as it will bring mercy
[54:27] to us it's our attitude towards every
[54:30] situation is very important so you know
[54:33] so what I want to take this morning is
[54:36] the effects of a tantrum and the effects
[54:39] of being a prisoner of the of the Lord
[54:41] Jesus Christ to a very two opposite
[54:42] things I mean so so one here one a head
[54:46] here was a prisoner to his emotions and
[54:48] basically it's unconverted nature and
[54:51] the other was not and the other that
[54:54] we'll go into or I'll just bring some
[54:57] examples they're not there on the other
[54:58] lords so their heart is governed fully
[55:01] by the Holy Ghost in my neighbor I mean
[55:03] I mean I had there are times
[55:05] he repented he actually sought the
[55:06] Lord's favor but was just basically just
[55:08] to get out of trouble you know many
[55:10] people repent because they get caught as
[55:12] opposed to God dealing with them true
[55:14] repentance is not because you get caught
[55:16] it's because actually God deals with you
[55:18] I mean so you know we don't want to just
[55:20] be oh you got busted
[55:22] so I'm sorry got your deal on our hearts
[55:25] Amen so so he got so now I just want you
[55:34] to we're just going to keep reading
[55:35] about me and technology aren't friends
[55:40] here we are where are we no we were
[55:42] backwards please hold
[55:46] okay here we are now they have had no
[55:50] idea that the effects of his tension
[55:53] would cause him to die in battle and
[55:55] dogs would look as blood and many times
[55:58] when we react to things we never think
[56:00] of the consequences it's always the here
[56:02] and the now and this is how I'm gonna be
[56:04] and this is what's going on in who cares
[56:06] and did it I'm gonna give my five cents
[56:08] I'm going to tell them give them a piece
[56:10] of my mind well really we should hold on
[56:11] to our mind because we'll lose our mind
[56:13] if we keep giving it away right so but
[56:16] you see he never he'd never fathomed in
[56:18] his mind that his reaction to nabe off
[56:20] would actually be he's gonna die in
[56:22] battle and the dogs are gonna lick his
[56:24] blood and The Jezabels gonna get eaten
[56:25] and his sons are gonna die and you know
[56:27] and because we never really look into
[56:29] maybe the effects of our response to
[56:31] things
[56:32] remember this life this society we live
[56:34] on is supercharged by emotion
[56:37] supercharged by the spirit live in the
[56:40] moment heaven and now you know why wait
[56:42] you don't need to wait heaven right now
[56:43] you know everything it though you don't
[56:45] need to say for money just you just use
[56:47] credit and you know I can I can have it
[56:49] right now I don't need to work for it I
[56:51] can just you know it's all instant it so
[56:54] it's all supercharged by emotion and but
[56:57] so and and the problem with that is that
[56:59] there's no stability in the world
[57:01] anymore talk about human character
[57:03] everything's either pulled by what this
[57:05] thing or this thing and pick a side make
[57:07] your decision you for us or against us
[57:09] or there's no middle ground anymore you
[57:11] even see what's going on in America at
[57:13] the moment you know that it's falling
[57:14] apart and we know it has to fall apart
[57:16] because the prophecy that's going to be
[57:18] smoke bombs and crowd
[57:19] so we can't stop it but it ones it's
[57:21] also polarized and that's the problem
[57:23] worth worth worth social media and you
[57:25] know what I would say to you through
[57:27] this could be very different to how I'd
[57:29] say to it to your face you know you know
[57:32] but this thing gives people a boldness
[57:33] you know you know even even now with
[57:36] with with young people even my
[57:37] generation you know you know you're
[57:39] sexting and so on your people
[57:41] unconverted people sending nude pics and
[57:44] different things and how they flirt
[57:45] online is very different to how that
[57:47] actually interact with people face to
[57:48] face why because there's this thing that
[57:51] they think it kind of makes them a bit
[57:52] more invincible or something and things
[57:55] that you would say to people online you
[57:57] wouldn't actually say it to their face
[57:58] but that's because that's the platform
[58:00] of communication has actually made the
[58:02] world more polarized there's no middle
[58:04] ground as meant to be an exchange of
[58:05] ideas Beck's actually just to grandstand
[58:07] shouting at each other
[58:08] instead of finding a middle ground amen
[58:12] and so we're going to be very careful
[58:14] that we could just keep walking with the
[58:16] word in an unstable age I mean there
[58:19] will be one people that will be stable
[58:20] and those who are surrendered to the
[58:21] Word of God though that know that God
[58:24] will stay stable amen you look at all
[58:27] the strife going on and Noah's day he
[58:29] just kept going on through didn't matter
[58:31] what was going on around him
[58:33] amen amen so I doubt very much that a
[58:38] habitat ever crossed his mind he had his
[58:41] dogs would be licking his blood because
[58:43] of what he did now now when I'm talking
[58:48] about this I'm not talking about like
[58:52] you know it's very different to have a
[58:56] tantrum and actually go and resolve a
[58:58] like the scripture says if there's an
[58:59] issue member we should we should deal
[59:01] with issues you know I think that's the
[59:03] problem with especially the Western
[59:04] world
[59:05] everything's fine on the outside but on
[59:08] the inside there's daggers and there's
[59:09] guns and there's plans and you know you
[59:12] know what I mean but you know we need to
[59:15] talk about things if they need to be
[59:17] addressed they need to be addressed and
[59:19] then hey if it tears the hide off my
[59:20] back good let's just get it done like it
[59:24] sees in the scripture here it says but I
[59:26] saying to you that whosoever is angry
[59:28] with his brother without a cause shall
[59:29] be in danger of the judgment but
[59:31] whosoever shall say to his
[59:33] Muraki shall be in danger of the council
[59:35] but whosoever shall say thou fool shall
[59:37] be in danger of Hell fire therefore if
[59:39] thou bring thy gift if thou bring thy
[59:41] gift of the altar and there rememberest
[59:43] it that that thy brother has Auto
[59:45] against thee leave there thy gift before
[59:48] the altar and go thy way be beat first
[59:51] be reconciled to thy brother then come
[59:53] and offer thy gift see here we come
[59:56] praise the Lord hallelujah glory or hold
[59:57] on I'm gonna lay my gift here I'm gonna
[1:00:00] go deal with this and then I'll come
[1:00:01] back so I'm not talking about when it
[1:00:04] comes to resolving issues you know
[1:00:06] there's a big difference between a
[1:00:07] tantrum and dealing with it right Amen
[1:00:10] now it's amazing and now this is this is
[1:00:16] maybe I'm just going to go kind of
[1:00:18] slowly through this button to me the
[1:00:21] children of Israel in the wilderness
[1:00:23] now this meant no this is just my kind
[1:00:26] of phraseology they had like a slow
[1:00:29] burning tantrum so then just erupted
[1:00:32] like this or slowly there was murmuring
[1:00:35] slowly us complaining maybe it started
[1:00:37] with one disgruntled here and one
[1:00:39] disgruntled here and they begin to talk
[1:00:41] and then finally the atmosphere and the
[1:00:43] camp began to change because you know it
[1:00:45] was sandy and it was hot and we're
[1:00:46] thirsty and you know so slowly it was so
[1:00:49] to me it's like a slow burning tantrum
[1:00:51] it's not a quick explosion but it was
[1:00:53] just like a slow kind of grumbling and
[1:00:55] so here they are it's amazing you know
[1:00:58] if you just read just just let's just
[1:00:59] break the scripture down here because
[1:01:01] this is where not long before this they
[1:01:06] cross the Red Sea they were dancing
[1:01:08] because their enemies were did Amen when
[1:01:11] it was like two million people had
[1:01:13] crossed the Red Sea and Miriam who's
[1:01:14] 80-odd years old took the tambourine and
[1:01:16] she laid all the sisters and worship and
[1:01:18] it would have been an incredible scene
[1:01:19] because their enemies were now dead and
[1:01:21] it's the same thing brother BAM says
[1:01:23] well when when we go through the blood
[1:01:24] of Jesus Christ we look back our enemies
[1:01:26] are dead amen our enemy of sinners dead
[1:01:29] and we have a jubilee hallelujah but
[1:01:31] then it wasn't long from that moment
[1:01:33] they were now in this condition now look
[1:01:35] and they journeyed and they took their
[1:01:37] journey from Elim and all the
[1:01:40] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:01:41] came into the wilderness of sin which is
[1:01:44] between Elim and Sinai on the 15th
[1:01:46] the second month after their departing
[1:01:48] out of the land of Egypt they hadn't
[1:01:50] been gone very long and the children of
[1:01:52] Israel said unto them would to God would
[1:01:56] to God we had died by the hand of the
[1:01:58] Lord in the land of Egypt when we set by
[1:02:01] our fleshpots and when we did eat bread
[1:02:04] to the full for ye have brought us forth
[1:02:07] out into this wilderness to kill this
[1:02:09] whole assembly with hunger now they had
[1:02:12] forgotten that when they're in Egypt
[1:02:14] their babies were taken from them
[1:02:17] killed or just thrown to the crocodiles
[1:02:19] to be fed to the crocodiles they are
[1:02:21] beaten by taskmasters they were just
[1:02:24] like they were not even valued as people
[1:02:26] they were just a commodity a tool in
[1:02:28] Pharaoh's hand if he said kill them they
[1:02:31] died if they starve they starved if they
[1:02:33] were beaten they were beaten they
[1:02:34] weren't even bellied as humans but here
[1:02:36] they were they had forgotten where they
[1:02:39] came from and we must never forget where
[1:02:41] we came from that's the reason God
[1:02:43] allows us to remember where we came from
[1:02:45] is that we are still thankful hallelujah
[1:02:47] so there's that we should never forget
[1:02:49] where we came from efforts from the
[1:02:50] world praise the Lord I'm out of the
[1:02:52] world it was just from just sitting in a
[1:02:54] Pew not knowing God then I meet him
[1:02:56] praise the Lord I met him holier so we
[1:02:58] should never forget where God has
[1:02:59] brought us from but somehow they forgot
[1:03:02] where God had brought them from they
[1:03:05] were wanting to go back into that
[1:03:06] condition because their walk was
[1:03:11] becoming uncomfortable now here's just a
[1:03:13] picture I found you know this is what
[1:03:15] Moses was dealing with you know it
[1:03:18] wasn't hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:03:20] god bless you brother Moses how you
[1:03:21] doing today and hallelujah we're going
[1:03:24] to Canaan sphere land I'm so excited and
[1:03:26] remember that taskmaster guy he's dead
[1:03:29] hallelujah hallelujah saw him floating
[1:03:31] there he died you ain't got drowned and
[1:03:33] you know we're free and you know God's
[1:03:35] delivering us and he's leading us with a
[1:03:37] pillar of fire by night cloud by day
[1:03:38] hallelu you know we'll get a night light
[1:03:40] all the time we don't need to be scared
[1:03:41] of the dark you know you know they could
[1:03:43] rejoice and well they like the snow oh
[1:03:46] why did you lead us out here to die
[1:03:48] Moses I saw annoyed it's so sandy and it
[1:03:51] gets in my eyes and I'm sick of us
[1:03:53] angels food and I've sick of us you know
[1:03:55] I'm thirsty and I and remember that came
[1:03:58] out of Goshen it was a nice piece of
[1:03:59] real estate
[1:04:00] it was well watered you know it's nice
[1:04:02] by the sea or by the river and if I like
[1:04:05] so would have you you know everyone
[1:04:06] likes to have a view of the ocean yeah
[1:04:08] so so they had a nice place to live but
[1:04:11] it wasn't with God one of them teamed up
[1:04:13] but they forgot the afflictions they
[1:04:15] were under there now they're complaining
[1:04:18] and grumbling wake up no I'm sick of
[1:04:20] this and daughter you know just this
[1:04:21] begins to spread was a slow-burning
[1:04:23] tantrum
[1:04:25] now they had no idea that this attitude
[1:04:29] would cause them to wander for 40 years
[1:04:31] in the wilderness there were just a few
[1:04:33] days there's actually not far if you
[1:04:35] look on the map to go from Egypt to
[1:04:37] Israel you could walk there in a couple
[1:04:39] of days maybe or even at I don't know
[1:04:41] it's not far but because of their
[1:04:43] complaining their slow burning tantrum
[1:04:46] base would spend 40 years in the
[1:04:48] wilderness
[1:04:49] now I'm really gone on the negative boat
[1:04:52] I'm we're gonna swing to the other side
[1:04:53] eventually your buddies want you to
[1:04:55] think about this they did not they never
[1:04:57] fathomed that this attitude would cause
[1:05:02] them to die in the wilderness you see
[1:05:07] sometimes actually a lot of the time god
[1:05:12] our walk is through many different
[1:05:15] things it's not always on the hilltop
[1:05:18] it's not always glorious as we would
[1:05:20] appear as we would think glorious amen
[1:05:24] but it it takes he takes us through
[1:05:27] valleys he takes us through hard times
[1:05:29] but we must never become offended where
[1:05:32] God is leading us remember the first
[1:05:34] thing they got unhappy with as they
[1:05:36] cross the Red Sea they had a jubilee
[1:05:38] Pentecostal meeting brother Brown said
[1:05:39] but then they walked for three days
[1:05:41] without water they came to a water
[1:05:43] source and it was bitter so they came to
[1:05:46] a bitter experience in their walk and
[1:05:48] God led them there it wasn't them just
[1:05:51] saying I wish we go well and they'll say
[1:05:53] well we don't have mister gurus list why
[1:05:54] don't we go this way well this way no no
[1:05:56] God God ordained their steps even when
[1:05:59] they came up to the Red Sea it wasn't
[1:06:01] them just making a mad dash for it and I
[1:06:03] ended up there God told Moses walk here
[1:06:05] walk here you'll end up here it was
[1:06:07] actually their ambush was actually
[1:06:09] prearranged by preordained by gods
[1:06:11] that's the same thing you think
[1:06:13] Sonia heels no gods are seeing in ambush
[1:06:15] Amen to wipe out your enemy that you can
[1:06:17] look back and say God is my deliverer
[1:06:19] hallelujah but you know though getting
[1:06:21] all worried and stressed about it but
[1:06:23] you know God ordained them to walk that
[1:06:25] way and so we need to be I say lord help
[1:06:27] us I mean that we don't begin to be
[1:06:30] unhappy or even you know even offended
[1:06:33] where God will take us you know John the
[1:06:36] Baptist was a mighty was a mighty
[1:06:38] prophet Jesus would give him the
[1:06:40] greatest compliment saying there's none
[1:06:42] like him in the Old Testament amen
[1:06:44] nothing like him and then and then and
[1:06:46] and that's the Lord putting Moses there
[1:06:48] and Elijah and all the different great
[1:06:50] prophets in other John's better than
[1:06:51] these ones you know but but here he was
[1:06:54] he had fulfilled his mission on earth
[1:06:57] you know he pointed out the Lamb of God
[1:06:59] he blot you know you know he exposed the
[1:07:01] sin of all the religious systems he did
[1:07:03] exactly what else meant to do
[1:07:04] and so but then he ends up in prison and
[1:07:07] then brother Bram says his eagle eyes
[1:07:09] filmed over because where he ended up
[1:07:12] and so he said to two of his disciples
[1:07:14] go ask Jesus are you really how much it
[1:07:17] would look for another you know because
[1:07:19] maybe he didn't expect to end up in
[1:07:21] prison remember he didn't do anything
[1:07:23] that this please God he wasn't being
[1:07:25] punished you know he didn't put a foot
[1:07:27] wrong he was walking perfectly according
[1:07:30] to the word that was meant for him but
[1:07:32] he ended up in prison and so many times
[1:07:35] you know sometimes we think all things
[1:07:37] go bad because we've done wrong no not
[1:07:39] necessarily maybe sometimes things go
[1:07:41] wrong because we've done right right
[1:07:43] yeah it doesn't mean guys displeased
[1:07:46] with us I'm going through a hard time
[1:07:47] that doesn't mean guys displeased with
[1:07:49] you yeah but it's normally because
[1:07:50] you're the believer sincere wants to
[1:07:52] because we love him because he's he
[1:07:55] saved us he's washed us in his blood you
[1:07:57] know he's given us a ticket to heaven
[1:07:58] with that money or price you know
[1:08:00] because we love Him we don't want to
[1:08:01] hurt him
[1:08:02] so when something goes wrong we begin to
[1:08:04] think we're Lord have I displeased you
[1:08:05] in some way amen but that's not if
[1:08:08] something goes wrong it doesn't mean
[1:08:10] we've done wrong hallelujah member God's
[1:08:13] love is proven in his election that's
[1:08:16] how he's proven his love I mean it's not
[1:08:17] like lovers parental care love which
[1:08:19] which that kind of love is you want to
[1:08:21] protect your children from all harm wrap
[1:08:23] them up in cotton wool again and again
[1:08:25] and again like they're a big beach ball
[1:08:26] and
[1:08:27] everything's fine and you know wherever
[1:08:28] they go there's not God's love God's
[1:08:31] love is shown an election he called us
[1:08:33] before the foundation of the world and
[1:08:35] the evidence of that as you heard this
[1:08:36] message in a quickened change your life
[1:08:38] and you see their word ami manifested in
[1:08:40] your life hallelujah
[1:08:42] and that's God proving his love for you
[1:08:44] I mean some so we must never forget that
[1:08:47] but sometimes we think well things are
[1:08:49] going bad well obviously the law I've
[1:08:51] done something wrong and this no doubt
[1:08:53] maybe wasn't John's mind he was thinking
[1:08:55] you know he never I don't know if he
[1:08:57] ever imagined that this is where he
[1:08:59] would end up but God's ordained path was
[1:09:03] life was prison God's ordained path for
[1:09:07] his life was to be beheaded because a
[1:09:08] little girl danced before the king you
[1:09:12] know sometimes we don't realize but
[1:09:14] actually our lives the people's reaction
[1:09:16] to our lives rather bring mercy or
[1:09:18] judgment whether we like it or not and
[1:09:20] it's not our fault you know Jesus
[1:09:25] couldn't help how people responded to
[1:09:27] him here he was healed the sick raise
[1:09:30] the dead brought life he didn't heed it
[1:09:33] he couldn't help how the Pharisees
[1:09:35] responded to him you know he just he was
[1:09:38] just doing what he was called to do and
[1:09:40] sometimes we get to you know I hope this
[1:09:43] comes out the right way but you know we
[1:09:44] can't help our people respond
[1:09:45] it's the spirit within them that will
[1:09:47] respond to a certain way that doesn't
[1:09:50] mean we just walk on and who cares what
[1:09:51] people say or do we should be mindful of
[1:09:53] people you understand but you know you
[1:09:55] can't help if people hate you or love
[1:09:57] you or whatever you can't help it right
[1:09:59] so here's John he ends up in prison and
[1:10:02] then he says now he asked his disciples
[1:10:05] to go and then Jesus says this to them
[1:10:09] this is the report you're going to give
[1:10:11] he says Jesus answer verse four and said
[1:10:15] unto him go and show John again those
[1:10:16] things which ye do hear and see the
[1:10:19] blind receive their sight the lame walk
[1:10:21] the lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear
[1:10:22] the dead are raised up and the poor have
[1:10:24] the gospel preached to them and blessed
[1:10:26] is he whosoever shall not be offended in
[1:10:29] me so so John is being told by the Lord
[1:10:33] you're blessed if you're not offended in
[1:10:34] me so do never we must never be offended
[1:10:38] where our walk will take us
[1:10:40] I mean because of member if we headed
[1:10:42] our own way nothing would go wrong we
[1:10:45] just plow through and we're just there
[1:10:46] the devil be mowed down in front of us
[1:10:48] never and will become a believer to be
[1:10:50] no trials or heartache or hardship or
[1:10:52] burden prayer or worry or shop none of
[1:10:55] that hey really really if you could
[1:10:57] really map out your life we'll just be
[1:10:59] oh boy
[1:11:00] hallelujah be like Rambo and nothing
[1:11:02] would go wrong and you at this theatres
[1:11:04] would you know but God hasn't made it
[1:11:06] that way because he wants to form
[1:11:08] character at us because that's the only
[1:11:11] thing we can take with us is our
[1:11:12] character you know there's a joke or
[1:11:14] something you know there was a man he um
[1:11:16] he he gave his whole life to business
[1:11:19] and and and what he ended up with was a
[1:11:22] few you know a pile of gold and he was
[1:11:25] actually for some reason allowed to take
[1:11:27] their gold with him up into glory and so
[1:11:29] he's there at the pearly gates and and
[1:11:32] st. Peter or whoever's there you know
[1:11:34] this is just it's just just a joke but
[1:11:35] you know you know the skies under this
[1:11:37] great wagga this gold so here I am I've
[1:11:40] arrived and st. Peter says John why are
[1:11:44] you bringing pavement into heaven you
[1:11:48] know men strives for pavement remember
[1:11:52] men the streets are lined with gold its
[1:11:55] pavement and but but people give their
[1:11:58] lives they they sacrifice their families
[1:12:00] they sacrifice so much just to earn
[1:12:04] pavement and remember in reality you
[1:12:07] can't take it with you anyway so you
[1:12:10] know we need a better perspective
[1:12:12] sometimes but you know this so but we
[1:12:16] should never be offended with a Lord
[1:12:19] takes us on our journey we just say Lord
[1:12:23] you've allowed this to happen
[1:12:25] remember Jesus said to Pilate the only
[1:12:28] reason you have power to help me
[1:12:31] crucified not because my father in
[1:12:32] Heaven's giving it to you don't think
[1:12:34] you've earned this sword don't think
[1:12:36] you've made this or achieve this no God
[1:12:38] allowed you to have this and it's the
[1:12:40] same thing all over the world people
[1:12:41] empower the reasons God allowed them to
[1:12:43] be in power that his word would be
[1:12:45] fulfilled I mean so we must never be
[1:12:48] offended when things go sideways or up
[1:12:50] or down or you're in zero gravity you
[1:12:52] don't know which ways up and
[1:12:53] things are going terrible don't be
[1:12:55] offended just keep walking through I
[1:12:58] mean but it all depends what your faith
[1:13:00] is upon if your faith is upon your
[1:13:03] emotions and how things appear to be
[1:13:04] going member thinks are as not as they
[1:13:07] appear write things out reality is not
[1:13:11] actually this this is passing away this
[1:13:14] is not even gonna be you know we're
[1:13:16] gonna remember being victorious and the
[1:13:18] devil being cast out and Paulo you know
[1:13:20] we're gonna remember the great victories
[1:13:21] you know but a lot of us is not even
[1:13:24] gonna be a memory you know so this the
[1:13:27] word is reality I mean the word is
[1:13:30] eternal I mean so let's not get caught
[1:13:33] up in things that come and go and
[1:13:34] trending not trending hashtags whatever
[1:13:37] you know it's gonna come it's gonna go
[1:13:38] it changes like the wind you know it
[1:13:41] changes like the weather in Auckland
[1:13:42] always you know it can be four seasons
[1:13:44] in a day you know it's like that we
[1:13:46] don't need to let's look at eternal
[1:13:48] things so that's why the children of
[1:13:50] Israel they were happy one day they were
[1:13:52] grumpy the other day but it just
[1:13:55] complaining constantly actually erodes
[1:13:58] your faith brother Graham says so so
[1:14:01] their faith was actually taken from them
[1:14:03] by their own complaining I mean but
[1:14:05] there were others in the camp that
[1:14:07] weren't like this you know we don't want
[1:14:10] to just go with the mob amen sure we are
[1:14:14] we are sheep but we don't want to go
[1:14:16] with the mob hallelujah we want to go
[1:14:18] the Lord's way amen that's what we need
[1:14:23] to do now he sees this brother Graham
[1:14:29] says us and the way to have fellowship
[1:14:31] God has to give it in love produces a
[1:14:34] fellowship now when God said back there
[1:14:37] the day that sin had separated that
[1:14:39] divine love God told Adam and Eve not to
[1:14:41] eat of these certain fruits and they did
[1:14:43] and sin brought separation and sin by
[1:14:46] separation brought hatred malice strife
[1:14:49] and envy is that right what happened
[1:14:52] they separated from divine love and when
[1:14:55] you separate from divine love and you
[1:14:57] can't overlook your brother's mistakes
[1:14:59] no more
[1:15:01] you've got to bawl him out for it that's
[1:15:04] right you can't overlook sisters mistake
[1:15:07] no more because you got away from that
[1:15:09] divine part that love part but if you
[1:15:13] really love the Lord Jesus now notice
[1:15:16] what he's saying he's not saying if you
[1:15:18] really love your brother or sister if
[1:15:20] you really love the Lord Jesus if sister
[1:15:23] or brother does something to you well oh
[1:15:25] well that's all right they didn't mean
[1:15:27] to do it that's the kind of love that
[1:15:29] Christ had Father forgive them they
[1:15:31] don't know what they're doing so it's
[1:15:34] this love between God and man will
[1:15:37] actually give love this way right it's
[1:15:40] not love this way it gives love this way
[1:15:42] it's actually your love with the Lord
[1:15:44] well we'll we'll fix this I mean but
[1:15:48] that's the problem see love love is just
[1:15:52] a word today it's not a reality I mean
[1:15:56] but but if we stay in divine love then
[1:15:58] you can overlook the faults of your
[1:16:01] brothers and sisters because love covers
[1:16:04] a multitude of sin but as I said before
[1:16:05] if this only needs to be talked to dealt
[1:16:08] with you got to do that right so I'm not
[1:16:10] saying just sweep everything under the
[1:16:12] rug and just ignore it no no things are
[1:16:13] going to be talked about if they need to
[1:16:14] be talked about right but but if if we
[1:16:18] really love the Lord then you'll love
[1:16:21] each other
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:27] now Jesus would not permit his disciples
[1:16:32] to preach the gospel until they received
[1:16:33] the Holy Ghost yet they had been honored
[1:16:35] to walk with him three and a half years
[1:16:37] though they were holy men accepted an
[1:16:39] aside but he would not let them go
[1:16:41] preach until they waited up there and
[1:16:43] got all the differences out of them and
[1:16:46] then the Holy Ghost came what the world
[1:16:48] needs today is that same feeling when
[1:16:51] the dumping out comes
[1:16:52] it needs a filling I mean what does the
[1:16:55] filling do when it comes in where you
[1:16:57] had doubt it brings faith now now I'm
[1:17:01] building up to those who are the
[1:17:02] prisoners of Jesus Christ right we've
[1:17:05] talked about the ten trimming ones it's
[1:17:06] done okay we'll move on because I don't
[1:17:08] believe I'm looking to people who are a
[1:17:10] heads you know as a phrase around our
[1:17:12] house as well yeah you know this week
[1:17:14] don't be an a hair back
[1:17:16] yes you know oh boy you know and I've
[1:17:21] got to remember that - don't be an Ahab
[1:17:23] lord help me you know but so so so so
[1:17:27] we're going this way now now so we're we
[1:17:29] have doubt it brings faith
[1:17:31] I mean we're you have indifference it
[1:17:34] brings love I mean so if you're
[1:17:37] indifferent empty it out and get love
[1:17:39] let us say Lord take my indifference
[1:17:42] away take my your people get so guarded
[1:17:45] and litter and they get become
[1:17:46] indifferent and cold don't become that
[1:17:47] way he's now been hurt too many times
[1:17:50] with look and he'll the hurt
[1:17:51] holy remember we're not meant to be
[1:17:53] walking bunkers you know you know I
[1:17:56] think I've seen this before but but I've
[1:17:58] been in an admiral yammamoto who was the
[1:18:00] leader of the Japanese and the southwest
[1:18:03] Pacific in World War two I've been in
[1:18:05] his bunker and Papua New Guinea it's not
[1:18:07] a nice place it's a bunker it's concrete
[1:18:09] and it's just it's dark and you know
[1:18:12] it's not nice and you can't it's not
[1:18:13] very big it's about as big as this room
[1:18:15] it's about two rooms this big not very
[1:18:18] big you know it's a bunker and that's
[1:18:20] how some people they become an air
[1:18:22] Christian walk they put up sandbags they
[1:18:24] put up some mint and it's reinforced
[1:18:26] cement they dig down they have you know
[1:18:27] machine-gun posts and you know they're
[1:18:29] just hiding away there's not how we
[1:18:31] meant to be it's but it's all because of
[1:18:33] hurt people become that way we're not
[1:18:35] meant to be living in a bunker Chris
[1:18:36] Shay's Minh to be walking the green
[1:18:38] grassy fields of God's Word enjoying the
[1:18:40] sunlight
[1:18:41] I mean having fellowship rejoicing every
[1:18:43] promise just walk over pick it up
[1:18:45] payment rejoice Amen isn't that right it
[1:18:48] should be a bunker mentality I mean
[1:18:51] because remember a rut if you know you
[1:18:54] know people get stuck in a rut well a
[1:18:56] rut the more it's driven in can become a
[1:18:58] ditch and a ditch can become a trench
[1:19:02] and if you keep digging where you can
[1:19:04] just make it into a bunker don't get
[1:19:06] stuck in a rut you know I think it was
[1:19:08] um I can't remember his name brother
[1:19:10] from Canada said you know a rush is just
[1:19:12] a grave with both ends kicked out yes
[1:19:15] there's a good analogy we don't want to
[1:19:17] be stuck in a rut and lord help us Lord
[1:19:20] get us out you know but I feel loved
[1:19:22] what I want I have you know might just
[1:19:25] be all closed away amen so empty out
[1:19:28] your indifference there Lord fill me
[1:19:30] love we had hatred it brings fellowship
[1:19:33] yes now the Apostle Paul would say this
[1:19:39] let this mind be in you which was in
[1:19:41] Christ Jesus now now we're talking to
[1:19:43] the remember the effects of those having
[1:19:45] a tantrum brought death and judgment but
[1:19:49] those who are the prisoners of Jesus
[1:19:50] Christ it brings mercy and deliverance I
[1:19:53] mean but let this mind be in you which
[1:19:55] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[1:19:57] the form of God thought it not equal to
[1:20:00] B I mean thought it not robbery to be
[1:20:02] equal with God sorry but made himself of
[1:20:04] no reputation and took upon him the form
[1:20:06] of a servant and was made in the
[1:20:08] likeness of men being found in the
[1:20:11] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:20:13] became obedient unto death even the
[1:20:16] death of the cross
[1:20:18] now when we think about the Ministry of
[1:20:20] the Lord Jesus Christ you know many
[1:20:22] times we just focus on the glory of it
[1:20:24] you know he you know he come you know he
[1:20:27] calmed the storm cast thousand-year-old
[1:20:31] Legion of Devils out of Legion you know
[1:20:33] raised Lazarus from the grave you know
[1:20:34] it did incredible you know the glory of
[1:20:36] coming out of the tomb triumphant we
[1:20:38] think about those things but his his
[1:20:41] walk wasn't all or glory what we
[1:20:44] consider glory but you know he as a man
[1:20:47] he had to humble himself to the Word of
[1:20:51] God that he had to fulfill remember the
[1:20:54] Apostle Paul would say that we would
[1:20:56] know him in the powers resurrection and
[1:20:58] the likeness of his sufferings so we all
[1:21:00] loved the resurrection part I was dead
[1:21:03] but now I live holy I got eternal life
[1:21:05] what about the likeness of a suffering
[1:21:07] spark because you got to have both you
[1:21:08] can't have one or the other right so so
[1:21:11] here he was as a man and he had to
[1:21:14] accept the Word of God that was that he
[1:21:17] had to fulfill so maybe I'll just
[1:21:20] backtrack a bit I'll just say it's our
[1:21:22] attitude towards the word will determine
[1:21:26] if we're an Ahab or a prisoner of the
[1:21:29] Lord Jesus Christ so it's our attitude
[1:21:31] will either giver will bring judgment
[1:21:33] upon us or we'll receive mercy that's
[1:21:36] our attitude see a Habs attitude towards
[1:21:40] what neighbor said was his attitude
[1:21:42] towards the word
[1:21:43] he had a tantrum and it killed my boss
[1:21:45] and brought judgment upon himself right
[1:21:48] and that so the scribes and Pharisees
[1:21:50] they touch the same Lord Jesus as the
[1:21:52] woman with the bloody shoe amen
[1:21:55] blind bartimaeus called out to the same
[1:21:58] one that the scribes and Pharisees he
[1:22:00] crucify him so they both spoke to the
[1:22:03] same one one got healing one got
[1:22:06] judgment it was the attitude towards the
[1:22:09] word that that that caused them to
[1:22:12] receive what they actually received amen
[1:22:15] so so now here's the Lord Jesus he had a
[1:22:21] he could have been offended at what he
[1:22:26] had to fulfill here he is I'm at
[1:22:28] Transfiguration know maybe I'm just you
[1:22:30] know here's a man here's the god man but
[1:22:32] he was a man he went to Calvary is a man
[1:22:35] not just with one person sin but the sin
[1:22:39] of the whole world and he's gonna be mad
[1:22:41] he is mad more than any man and here is
[1:22:44] our Mount Transfiguration Elijah and and
[1:22:47] and Moses appear and it says I think in
[1:22:49] the Book of Luke that account it says
[1:22:51] and they told him what he had to
[1:22:53] accomplish with his decrease at
[1:22:54] Jerusalem so they came from another
[1:22:56] world as a voice from another world and
[1:22:58] they began to preach them saying this is
[1:23:00] what you have to fulfill and they went
[1:23:02] to Isaiah and they went to different
[1:23:04] parts of the scripture they went to
[1:23:05] Genesis chapter 3 and they begin to lay
[1:23:07] out everything he had to accomplish
[1:23:10] hallelujah now now here's here's the
[1:23:12] Lord Jesus as a man and he's being told
[1:23:15] you're going to be wounded for our
[1:23:17] transgressions you're going to be
[1:23:19] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:23:21] chastisement of our peace will be upon
[1:23:23] you but by your stripes we will be
[1:23:25] healed you will be marred more than any
[1:23:28] man you'll be done before your accusers
[1:23:31] you'll be led as a sheep to the
[1:23:32] slaughter
[1:23:33] amen you'll be pierced in your hands in
[1:23:36] your feet
[1:23:37] you'll be rejected Amen that will mock
[1:23:40] you they'll spit on you they will
[1:23:42] despise you this is what you have to
[1:23:44] fulfill now imagine if I came to you and
[1:23:47] said now this is this is this is your
[1:23:48] next 48 hours this is this is in your
[1:23:50] schedule now will you get a fit what do
[1:23:53] you mean I'm a believer this is not done
[1:23:56] God
[1:23:57] this is not how it's gonna be look all
[1:23:59] these victories I've had look at what
[1:24:00] goes if none of those not this way
[1:24:03] that's being offended but was he
[1:24:06] offended he knew the full magnitude of
[1:24:09] what he had to do he knew it but he
[1:24:12] decided in Gethsemane not my will but
[1:24:17] thy will be done he won the victory
[1:24:20] there and he went to Calvary and he
[1:24:24] would cry on the cross my God my God was
[1:24:26] elfis akin me he died as a as a lot he
[1:24:30] died as a sinner that we would not have
[1:24:32] to die as a sinner member he took our
[1:24:34] place he had to choose he had that meant
[1:24:37] now the greatest miracle in his life
[1:24:39] that I see is not him bringing Lazarus
[1:24:41] from the grave as not even coming the
[1:24:43] storm or you know as not all those
[1:24:45] things but the greatest miracle in his
[1:24:47] life I see is he actually subjected his
[1:24:50] life to the prophecy he had to fulfill
[1:24:52] he actually took this flesh and said I'm
[1:24:56] gonna fulfill I'm gonna surrender my
[1:24:59] will over so it's not my own ability
[1:25:01] that's gonna do it it's not yes I'm
[1:25:02] power of yo y'all got a strong will and

[1:25:34] Word of God concerning him hallelujah he
[1:25:39] said well how can you do that while your
[1:25:40] own ability you can't do it but if you
[1:25:43] give your life to Him he said Lord not
[1:25:46] my will but thy will be done
[1:25:49] hallelujah then he'll take you through
[1:25:51] all the way remember he wasn't a robot
[1:25:54] he wasn't just some empty shell that had
[1:25:56] no emotion had no feeling amen he was a
[1:25:59] man he felt like a man he had a motion
[1:26:04] like any human head emotion they said
[1:26:07] law I'm gonna fulfill your word
[1:26:09] this is why I've come into the world and
[1:26:11] even Sid when he prayed other than
[1:26:12] Johnny sidled father I sanctify myself
[1:26:14] for the SH for his disciples sake for
[1:26:18] those that would still be here
[1:26:20] he had such a burden lord I want to see
[1:26:22] I want to see you affect them
[1:26:24] hallelujah this is one Holly member the
[1:26:26] effects of being a prisoner Holly we
[1:26:29] talked about those who who who have
[1:26:31] Tantrums anybody remember he he actually
[1:26:34] watch fulfilled the word then it wasn't
[1:26:38] just it wasn't him receiving mercy I
[1:26:40] mean but we would receive mercy wasn't
[1:26:42] that he would receive eternal life
[1:26:43] though he had it I mean but we would
[1:26:45] receive it Holly said well that's the
[1:26:47] Lord of glory what about those made in
[1:26:49] His image I mean what about those
[1:26:51] maintenance image that there we are are
[1:26:53] we not hallelujah by the Holy Ghost I
[1:26:56] mean we're made in His image hallelujah
[1:27:00] I mean God is looking for prisoners what
[1:27:04] are you up to Lord Jesus I'm I'm hunting
[1:27:07] prisoners what is he doing today looking
[1:27:10] for prisoners
[1:27:11] you know brother Graham said that
[1:27:13] peoples would say to him I'm American I
[1:27:15] can do this and I can do that and I can
[1:27:16] do that he says know if you're Christian
[1:27:19] you give up your rights you know we have
[1:27:23] to be willing to walk with him even if
[1:27:26] it's full of ridicule character
[1:27:29] assassination whatever it may be
[1:27:30] rejection hatred whatever we said Lord
[1:27:33] I'm walking through I mean we're through
[1:27:36] he willing said Lord you know even if
[1:27:39] the whole world despises us what are we
[1:27:41] going to know about it we're gonna be
[1:27:43] offended how are we gonna still love
[1:27:46] them now there's the challenge it's easy
[1:27:48] see it's even to say I love you because
[1:27:49] you got you know everyone treats me good
[1:27:51] it's easier to say it but when someone
[1:27:54] does not love you can you love them can
[1:27:59] you treat them with love and actually
[1:28:01] walk in their shoes amen well I just
[1:28:04] want to heap coals of fire on their head
[1:28:06] well that's the wrong motive know what
[1:28:09] if anyone in their right mind would
[1:28:12] never wish a person to go for even five
[1:28:15] seconds to help anyone in their right
[1:28:17] mind would never wish even their worse
[1:28:19] worst enemy you would never want them
[1:28:21] there
[1:28:24] God is looking for prisoners he's always
[1:28:26] done it you might search it through the
[1:28:29] scripture a man has to be a prisoner to
[1:28:31] Christ against anything therefore you
[1:28:33] cannot be connected with anything but
[1:28:35] Christ even your father your mother your
[1:28:37] brother your sister your husband your
[1:28:38] wife anybody your only Creek connected
[1:28:41] with Christ and him only and then God
[1:28:43] can use you until then you can't what
[1:28:46] does that mean I'll leave my family know
[1:28:48] that mean I just yeah go be in the world
[1:28:50] or somewhere no you're gonna be
[1:28:52] connected with him let's have a look at
[1:28:58] a few prisoners I took the main prisoner
[1:29:00] I mean be seized it's all through the
[1:29:03] scripture it's all through the scripture
[1:29:06] remember remember this is going on let's
[1:29:10] just go back to the picture a lot of
[1:29:11] pictures this is all going on but this
[1:29:14] one guy that is not going on with this
[1:29:17] two actually will just take one his name
[1:29:19] is Caleb he's not caught up in the
[1:29:22] complaining in this and the problem with
[1:29:23] the sand and blaming complaining about
[1:29:25] the food and all the stuff and what's
[1:29:27] going on no something happened
[1:29:30] remember he was and he was in slavery
[1:29:32] like they were he was beaten like they
[1:29:34] were he would have suffered lost maybe
[1:29:37] in his extended family of a child being
[1:29:39] fed to the crocodiles like they did he
[1:29:41] suffered all those same things but
[1:29:43] something in him did not complain he did
[1:29:46] not begin to throw a tantrum a
[1:29:48] slow-burning tantrum and in when the
[1:29:50] going got tough because he was not
[1:29:53] looking at his surroundings
[1:29:55] help us Lord Jesus just now he wasn't
[1:29:58] looking at his surroundings he was
[1:30:00] looking at a promise and though he had
[1:30:03] never walked into the Promised Land at
[1:30:05] that time I don't think you know he was
[1:30:07] he was so caught up with the fact that
[1:30:10] he had an inheritance remember he was he
[1:30:16] said you know and in an even Moses or
[1:30:18] the Lord would say about him but my
[1:30:20] servant Caleb because he had another
[1:30:22] spirit with him
[1:30:23] and has followed me fully who wants to
[1:30:25] follow the Lord fully not just a
[1:30:27] part-time Christian knows just a Sunday
[1:30:28] morning Wednesday night wherever kind of
[1:30:30] Christian but up all the time christian
[1:30:32] hali my whole heart god is yours but is
[1:30:35] it
[1:30:35] but not the convenient bus but everybody
[1:30:37] I mean him will I bring into the land
[1:30:40] we're enter he went and his seed shall
[1:30:43] possess it they mean sir he he didn't
[1:30:45] have a spirit of complaining a spirit of
[1:30:47] unbelief of yo groaning and moaning
[1:30:49] whatever he had a different spirit with
[1:30:51] him he had the Lord's spirit with him
[1:30:52] hello and that brought a faith I mean it
[1:30:55] didn't bring in unbelief and a doubt and
[1:30:57] a strife and all those things like
[1:30:58] everyone else was doing it you know
[1:31:00] that's the lamest excuse when people say
[1:31:03] we everyone else is doing it you know
[1:31:05] everyone else didn't get on the ark
[1:31:06] either apart from eight what have you
[1:31:10] got you know what you got oh everyone
[1:31:11] else's throwing tomatoes and stuff at
[1:31:14] the Arkell whatever they did making fun
[1:31:15] so they're you know no no let's not go
[1:31:17] with the crowd I don't want to just do I
[1:31:20] when else is doing it oh it's trending
[1:31:22] at the moment among the believers hold
[1:31:23] on you know we want to just walk with
[1:31:26] the Lord I mean we don't want to make
[1:31:29] factions and and be clannish and cliques
[1:31:32] and whatever more you know this goes
[1:31:34] beyond color race nationality age
[1:31:38] doesn't matter God's not interested in
[1:31:40] that he's looking at a seat
[1:31:42] he's look at a pre-decide see that's
[1:31:44] this important thing amen and we should
[1:31:46] be the same way because never we get
[1:31:47] caught up on what's going on in the
[1:31:49] world we will not discern the body of
[1:31:51] the Lord and we want to be able to
[1:31:53] discern the body of the Lord which is
[1:31:55] you and I by the way amen so so he had a
[1:31:58] different spirit with him even though he
[1:31:59] you know he suffered the same way he
[1:32:02] went to the waters of Marah and drank
[1:32:04] them he had a bitter walk as well
[1:32:06] remember he had the Red Sea - he was
[1:32:08] there yes he he drank the bitter waters
[1:32:11] of Mara he was there amen you know he
[1:32:15] walked through the desert - he was there
[1:32:16] he had exactly the same experience as
[1:32:19] everyone else but there's a different
[1:32:21] spirit with him why because he realized
[1:32:25] he realized he had a revelation a mint
[1:32:30] that he was going to the promised land
[1:32:32] it wasn't because ah what are you guys
[1:32:34] up to were going to the promise and his
[1:32:35] Moses prays delicious go along short
[1:32:37] happens that I he had a revelation amen
[1:32:39] he had an inheritance hallelujah
[1:32:41] he had he had a revelation I mean that
[1:32:43] he had a mountain I mean so instead of
[1:32:46] doubting and complaining no he was
[1:32:48] is strong in the promise you know I've
[1:32:50] done it before but just imagine if you
[1:32:52] go now it's nighttime there in the
[1:32:53] wilderness you know there's the tribes
[1:32:55] and camped around the tabernacle and
[1:32:56] imagine goes into the complainers tents
[1:32:59] what's the team Ouma mana you know eat
[1:33:06] your mana you know but this complaining
[1:33:08] there's and it's not just the children
[1:33:10] you know just goes to the parents and
[1:33:11] you know just the whole thing and then
[1:33:13] those talk about the sand and the heat
[1:33:14] and then and and the sunshine and why
[1:33:17] are they in Goshen anymore in Goshen was
[1:33:19] so much better in there yeah I remember
[1:33:20] the fleshpots and the leeks and the
[1:33:22] onions and all the oil was so good
[1:33:23] remember the yeah yeah you know the
[1:33:25] salmon rise over the Nile was so
[1:33:27] beautiful and they forgot their children
[1:33:29] with me to that you know thrown in there
[1:33:30] you know but they just complain and it
[1:33:32] always go why this and why this and this
[1:33:34] is wrong and this is wrong
[1:33:36] what an atmosphere to live in what an
[1:33:39] atmosphere but then we'll go into
[1:33:41] Caleb's tent and they and they put the
[1:33:45] man on the table or how they did that
[1:33:47] bow their heads and thank Jehovah God
[1:33:49] thank you Lord we're not in slavery
[1:33:51] anymore
[1:33:51] thank you you set us free our
[1:33:54] taskmasters died in the Red Sea we watch
[1:33:56] them drown Amen Lord you led us there
[1:33:58] you've led us now your puller fires over
[1:34:01] the tabernacle I mean you're speaking
[1:34:03] through your servant I mean you've
[1:34:04] revealed to us that we're going into an
[1:34:06] inheritance and then maybe the children
[1:34:08] would say Danny what was it like this is
[1:34:10] the bedtime story
[1:34:11] well son it was beyond anything why was
[1:34:16] it because the mountains were bigger
[1:34:17] because the waters were rivers were
[1:34:20] bigger why that's more than that son see
[1:34:23] there's a secret in that inheritance son
[1:34:24] it's more than honey and milk and it's
[1:34:28] flowing with it what is it what is it
[1:34:31] what does another more than that
[1:34:32] son there's a resurrection in that place
[1:34:34] you see why we're carrying Joseph's
[1:34:37] bones why are we carrying those bones
[1:34:40] daddy because he was a prophet and he
[1:34:43] knew that there was no resurrection and
[1:34:45] in in Egypt he could have had the
[1:34:47] biggest permit simple cut whatever he he
[1:34:49] could add the fanciest one but he didn't
[1:34:52] want to be put in that fancy term he
[1:34:54] want to be buried in a case he wanted to
[1:34:56] be buried in the promised land Oh daddy

[1:35:15] written down the other day
[1:35:16] Holly where where literally he was
[1:35:18] transported back into the Garden of Eden
[1:35:20] he saw the first judgment and judgment
[1:35:22] was poured out upon the serpent and the
[1:35:25] devil but mercy was given to Adam
[1:35:26] Alleluia and Eve hallelujah and there's
[1:35:29] a promise at the scene of the woman's

[1:36:02] there's more than a story Holly it's
[1:36:04] more than a nice idea I'm here to bend
[1:36:07] to keep my word in your life I'm here to

[1:36:30] hit way across I told you would cross
[1:36:32] highway oh did they take Jericho there's
[1:36:37] another prisoner in Jericho it's amazing
[1:36:39] what people get out of God it's amazing
[1:36:42] God has Richard mercy the scripture
[1:36:43] tells us he's Richard mercy I mean
[1:36:46] there's no financial crisis in heaven
[1:36:48] where where the commodity of mercy goes
[1:36:50] down and goes up he's rich amen he can't
[1:36:53] run out of mercy but it's those that
[1:36:55] look for mercy find mercy I mean those
[1:36:58] unfortunate look for judgment because of
[1:37:00] criticism they get judgment but those
[1:37:02] that look for mercy they get mercy it's
[1:37:05] amazing his rehab she's not the
[1:37:08] up-and-up in the city she she's the out
[1:37:10] washer Society hey bunkie

[1:37:14] of social distancing from her you know
[1:37:16] cuz of what she does if I knew what she
[1:37:17] did but they all heard the testimony of
[1:37:21] what God did in Egypt they all heard the
[1:37:23] same story and I was weeping over this
[1:37:26] last night said Lord how on earth did
[1:37:28] she know there was mercy / how did she

[1:37:39] here somewhere

[1:40:38] these people coming are they just over
[1:40:39] there they all new member this is what
[1:40:46] this is how this is the mood of the
[1:40:48] people in Jericho they all knew they
[1:40:51] were under judgment and if and if these
[1:40:53] people could destroy all them how they
[1:40:56] going to stand but there was a woman
[1:40:59] there she didn't throw a tantrum she
[1:41:03] didn't throw a tantrum I mean but she
[1:41:05] somehow knew that if he was a god of
[1:41:08] judgment he was a God of mercy also it
[1:41:11] was revealed her I don't know how it
[1:41:12] worked up as you said now hallelujah

[1:41:18] the Lord since I have showed you
[1:41:20] kindness that you will also show me
[1:41:22] kindness unto my father's house and give

[1:41:40] Richard mercy all she heard about was
[1:41:42] judgment there were no Gentiles you know
[1:41:46] you know she's a Gentile she's under
[1:41:50] judgment have you ever put yourself
[1:41:51] there somehow she knew Lord
[1:41:53] it must be mercy and all this
[1:41:55] destruction that's going on and Azrael
[1:41:57] coming out and they're coming this way
[1:41:58] it must be a mercy that I can receive
[1:42:01] and as as I seek God is Richard mercy
[1:42:05] and if you're looking for mercy you will
[1:42:07] receive mercy hallelujah because he's
[1:42:09] red channet Amen she was looking she was
[1:42:11] looking at she found mercy hallelujah
[1:42:13] and it's amazing you know the walls came
[1:42:16] tumbling down her house was on the top
[1:42:19] of the wall the scripture says the walls
[1:42:21] fell down flat and her house was
[1:42:24] preserved everything he just withdrew he
[1:42:25] went down to ground level saving and the
[1:42:28] destruction she was kept safe way
[1:42:30] because she looked for mercy I pray to
[1:42:33] God we're looking for mercy this morning
[1:42:34] I mean we just not taking him for
[1:42:36] granted but he is rich and mercy
[1:42:38] he is rich and deliverance hallelujah
[1:42:42] hallelujah she somehow knew that there
[1:42:47] was mercy and she found mercy hallelujah
[1:42:55] amen Joshua didn't throw a tantrum he
[1:43:01] became a prisoner they conquered Elijah
[1:43:06] he had his weak spots and his walk he
[1:43:09] would even pray against the will of God
[1:43:11] he said Lord take my life I'm just I'm
[1:43:13] no good and God had already in his mind
[1:43:16] oh you're gonna take your flaming
[1:43:17] chariot ride chariot of fire you're
[1:43:19] gonna be taking a body change you know a
[1:43:22] rapture he would he would be praying
[1:43:24] against God's will for his life so he
[1:43:27] had his weak spots but he became a
[1:43:29] prisoner to the Word of God he didn't
[1:43:31] throw a tantrum hallelujah he took a
[1:43:34] rapture amen
[1:43:37] our Lord Jesus I said surrendered his
[1:43:40] will to the Word of God for his life I
[1:43:42] mean the Apostle Paul would stand before
[1:43:45] King Agrippa and he'll begin to relate
[1:43:46] the visitation on the road to Damascus
[1:43:49] and he would write to Timothy about in
[1:43:51] joy
[1:43:51] as a soldier and he would tell about
[1:43:53] being shipwrecked and being destitute
[1:43:54] and you know being being being beaten
[1:43:57] and stoned in all those troubles that he
[1:43:59] had hallelujah but because he was a
[1:44:02] prisoner it's amazing when Paul wrote
[1:44:04] Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ it
[1:44:09] wasn't a nice term what title can I give
[1:44:12] myself today that's impressive no no no
[1:44:15] he experienced what it was like to be a
[1:44:18] prisoner showing the power of the blood
[1:44:21] hallelu showing the power of the
[1:44:24] salvation we have received that he went
[1:44:27] through all kinds of manner of trouble
[1:44:28] false brethren Antichrist spirit
[1:44:30] everything coming ISM but he said to
[1:44:33] King Agrippa but I was not disobedient
[1:44:35] to the heavenly vision I mean remember
[1:44:38] we've been called will be called to
[1:44:40] fulfill the word hallelujah we've been
[1:44:43] called that this word would manifest in
[1:44:44] our lives I mean we're here amen to run
[1:44:47] this final lap hallelujah I'm glad we
[1:44:50] have life in our bodies I'm glad we have
[1:44:52] strengthen our bodies I mean that Lord
[1:44:54] would you would take us for his glory
[1:44:56] you manifest his glory out of us not
[1:44:58] because we're anything but because he is
[1:45:00] everything
[1:45:00] Amen to us like brother enforce it on on
[1:45:03] on Wednesday Amy but when you let God be
[1:45:05] God amen but but but when you try and
[1:45:08] take the situation under your own
[1:45:09] control that's going to end up in
[1:45:11] Ricker's but when you let God be God let
[1:45:13] him take control of every situation then
[1:45:16] he can step on the scene and do what he
[1:45:18] wants to do hallelujah and when any
[1:45:23] believer comes to God he becomes God's
[1:45:25] attribute of his word he is used to
[1:45:28] manifest the word that's promised for
[1:45:29] that day see that's right god richard
[1:45:31] mercy has never left us without a
[1:45:34] testimony he is richard mercy you know
[1:45:37] it's very easy to yeah we can go through
[1:45:39] the heroes of faith say praise the Lord
[1:45:40] our prisoners hallelujah we go through
[1:45:42] the prophets life but now we're here now
[1:45:45] we're here they've run their race
[1:45:47] they're done if they could stand here
[1:45:50] for a few moments they would be
[1:45:52] screaming at the top of their lungs as
[1:45:53] two glorious tumors they would try and
[1:45:57] describe what it's like to go to glory
[1:45:58] what it's like there brother haven't
[1:45:59] seen it so sublime sublime can't even
[1:46:01] touch it as perfect as beyond language
[1:46:03] you know you can't express how
[1:46:05] does he says whatever you do don't miss
[1:46:08] it lay aside everything else but just
[1:46:11] don't miss it he says only divine love
[1:46:13] can get you there that's the Holy Ghost
[1:46:14] but they would they would maybe try to
[1:46:17] express how great it was to be there but
[1:46:21] God is looking for prisoners I might
[1:46:24] just leave this kind of chopped ups
[1:46:26] think just for that statement God is
[1:46:28] looking for prisoners it's a big
[1:46:32] difference between being a believer and
[1:46:36] being a believer with the Holy Ghost if
[1:46:38] you're just a believer you'll fall and
[1:46:42] fail but if you know him you may fall
[1:46:47] but you'll get back up and you'll
[1:46:48] overcome we can't emphasize enough the
[1:46:52] supernatural and how strong and powerful
[1:46:55] our God is in keeping us walking with
[1:46:57] Him irrespective of the journey you say
[1:47:01] you know if we all went back five years
[1:47:03] and we actually thought how our life
[1:47:05] would be up to this point I doubt very
[1:47:07] much we would even be close to what has
[1:47:09] happened but God knew where we would be
[1:47:14] God knew where we would be and God has
[1:47:17] ordained our steps but it's our reaction
[1:47:21] to it everything in life will make us
[1:47:24] better brother Ryan hey see this other
[1:47:26] words your policy that many times and
[1:47:28] everything in life will make us bitter a
[1:47:30] bitter person or a bitter person but it
[1:47:35] depends member Caleb and the rest of us
[1:47:38] are all had the same experiences one
[1:47:41] group became bitter
[1:47:43] he became bitter right but it depends
[1:47:49] what you surrender yourself to if you
[1:47:51] give yourself to the Word of God let him
[1:47:53] lead you you'll become a better person
[1:47:55] if you leave if you surrender yourself
[1:47:58] to your emotions you'll become a better
[1:48:00] person that's the choice we have which
[1:48:06] one do we want I want to be a prisoner
[1:48:09] isn't he worth it isn't he worthy isn't
[1:48:13] he worthy palea when he was on the cross
[1:48:16] your honors mine
[1:48:18] holy I'm gonna undo I'm going to take
[1:48:20] all this in a way I'm gonna reveal
[1:48:22] myself I'm gonna shed my life that I
[1:48:25] can't dwell in my people don't just be
[1:48:26] with them but being them I'm gonna be
[1:48:28] their comfort I'm gonna be that guy I'm
[1:48:30] gonna be their sorrows and their pain
[1:48:32] I'm I'm gonna walk in human flesh that I
[1:48:35] will understand what they go through
