out there in cyber world give them a hand have a praise Amen you know we're spreading out the praise amen there's a big geographical coverage right now praising the bride is praising Jesus amen all over the place amen hallelujah amen will I greet you all in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ and grateful to be here and just you know it is a wonderful experience and you know you just walk in and the presence of the Lord so we've got something to look forward to amen this place is the house of the Lord amen but it beside that in your living room wherever you're at right now you know you can you can have the same atmosphere because our God is not limited by geography Amen hallelujah amen so you just invite him to your sofa invite him to your chair invite him we are at right now he's going to come he always comes where he's invited amen hallelujah well you know we don't have that much time but you know we just want to appreciate brother Ben and for the invitation to minister and just want to thank you who who's grateful for a godly pastor amen hallelujah amen thank the Lord amen we're so thankful and we're so blessed in this place amen God is so good to us hallelujah amen well thank you musicians we are going to now get to the word and I would like to invite your attention tonight to a small but profound Scripture and a very personal scripture for us amen when this you all mysteries coming together but it's got to be a personal God where the rubber hits the road amen hallelujah hallelujah so let's turn in our Bibles to Romans 9 verse 33 amen hallelujah and so we want to minister a subject here if we just read here as it says here in Romans 9 verse 33 say Amen when you're there Amen hallelujah it says here as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed metal or dead is blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen well tonight I just want to minister a little bit on a subject which is called smitten by my first love amen now we can go home because you know that thought there oh man you know I I just I just sat there and the Lord just kind of spoke that title to me because I didn't know what to name it you know I kind of had these things out and and and I know that the stone the stone that has been laid in Zion now I want to say hello Zion hello Brad good morning Shalom to you amen there is a stone that has been laid in you hallelujah and I want to talk about what the stone this this revelation this person what he wants to do and what he has done and what he is doing in your life tonight and what he's doing in has done in your life and what he would desire to have as a result of the stone coming amen that you could be smitten by your first love you know and you know we think of our first lovers as something but really our first lovers him he is our first love and so when we really connected to him you know we're coming back to our first love amen because he is our first love and we when there is a place that we can get to and I don't want to get right ahead of myself I want to build up to this but there's a place that we can get to so intimate so affected so impacted so permeated the big Megaman is a new word for you permeated who knows what permeates it means Amen it's like it's just all over you and all through you and all around you Amen all under you all above you or beside you all-bran everywhere permeated hallelujah Amen well we want to be you know you know when you fall in love with somebody you know you know you you're permeated Amen you're permeated by the feeling Amen you know and I really believe you know we should feel our love for Jesus yes you know there is a divine love that we love him and that cannot be broken and nothing can separate us from us but sometimes we get so busy and things get caught up and maybe we go through such a trial and the scars just make it a bit dull or a bit tired and you've stopped feeling that love that you have for him you know the feeling disappears but we should have a feeling for our God we should have a love a heartfelt religion amen that goes beyond the teaching hallelujah that we should love him and the unbreakable reality of that perfect love that exists within you because the perfect love of God that we would love him and have loved him and that's the love that he loved us before the world began that love it's already in you amen that love exists with him the seed that was placed in your life before you came to understand anything there was a seed inside hallelujah that was waiting to be germinated that was waiting to be to crack open and and and and come forth amen there was a perfect love in there amen hallelujah but that perfect love needs to go beyond just staying right in there it there's a journey there's a growth visa there's a there's it needs to be accumulating amen the profits is that that love would accumulate hallelujah who likes there who enjoys the reality there that this love would accumulate in your life amen and when there's that love accumulates that your faith would accumulate amen and then you will stimulate amen hallelujah amen I think we're gonna talk some jargon tonight amen that maybe only the locals will understand Amen that we will stimulate tonight brother among amen and we will stimulate because of the love of God amen hallelujah but you see and we're going to hit something a little later that which the title kind of encapsulate that we are smitten smitten has anyone heard of the term smitten when you're smitten when you first met your girl or you first met that boy and that one that the Lord revealed to you is your your husband your spouse your wife amen and you just can't get a nothing else man this just that's it everything around you or your thoughts or it's not just hiding somewhere deep down Amen it's not just buried down in some theology hallelujah Amen it goes beyond information of that person's name it goes beyond all of those things and you just saturated Amen well I believe now tonight and I want to encourage you that you can be saturated by the love that already is in you hallelujah that love a man sometimes it just gets so buried down because some other things get tied up in our life and we get caught up and enjoying building this building this natural kingdom building our home making this thing look good making that thing go there helping there and doing all these works and sometimes you know we leave and and as the Prophet would say we mark that love you know the Prophet you know he says this he says I just can't even love my wife the way I really should know not that he doesn't love her he says I can't express the love that I have for my wife the way that I should because I don't want to Mar that love for him amen we may hit that later on hallelujah let's just we work to need you just listen and you can turn and study this later but Isaiah 54 verse 4 it says fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed amen remember who they that believe on him that stone that was laid in silence shall not be ashamed amen and and I want to link that ashamed to Baroness because Baroness in biblical times and in the scripture is a shame it is something wrong right there's something wrong in those biblical times now we're talking about a spiritual Baroness now now we do not want there is something that needs to happen inside the heart something that needs to happen that would cause a person to not be barren amen - to - that they would come forth out of their life a spiritual child amen and so it says here fear not Alleluia there's a reason why it says fear not it's a bit that wherever within the absence of fear faith can operate amen but the only thing to remove fear is perfect love I just want to say it say this love as before all things even before your faith before you believe really believe now before all love divine love I loved him because he first loved me that's the love that's before all things amen and no man can come to me except my father draws him first no man can come to me except my father draws him first so there's a love these are in a drawing happens and then the goodness of God starts to come over your life and now when we think about these things you know you just think about it and get it into a meditation cycle in your and your thoughts and you start meditating on how good he is you start meditating on the on the odds of you being a true believer that as Holy Ghost filled that as being a coming to their full adoption that is being sanctified and cleansed by fire and being rapture ready in this world right now and you think my where did I come from what did I it was man and how much how many times before you met him did he save you from death how many near-death experiences that he saved you from because he's because he's got a purpose for you and when we start to ponder over these things and the boisterous seas the tumultuous battles and all those things and he brings you through every single one and you think about these things and the Prophet says it will bring perfect love at what he says how can you not perfectly love him when you start to ponder over these things amen so there is a real virtue and meditating on the word and meditating on what he's done for you amen on a personal level now the meditation that's glorious and I'm not going to say don't do it but to meditate on the word and see all of us are mad and see how it all joins together as good wonderful but what about the personal how does it affect me what has he done for me what has he done for my family what has he done for my my my loved ones a man what is he doing for this and part of that's when it really starts to have an effect hey man so he says fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker as thy husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and a redeemer the Holy One of Israel just say his name Jesus that's his name hallelujah what a beautiful name it is nothing compares to this nothing can stand against the name of Jesus hallelujah oh my that could evoke a worship right now amen that name hallelujah the god of the whole earth shall be he be called you know and I and I really pray because remember you are a little mini earth you're a micro earth let's put it that way you know you're a whole ecosystem in your own right you're a little earth made of clay and then you've got you've got the earth went through water blood and that's going to have a fiery baptism you have gone through water blood in a fiery baptism a man the earth will one day have a new heaven and a new earth come down you're getting your new heaven and new earth soon amen you're gonna have an agoraphobe body come down on you soon amen and when you start to think about these things you think oh God oh my whole little bit need to be real Oh God amen hallelujah amen hallelujah yes the god of the whole earth let him be the God of your whole earth amen amen you see he rules inside you but you see there has to be now there there's a war going on it's not just he comes in and it's all nice bitter roses no no no no no way because how does the character get developed with them that's why he didn't convert your old human spirit and your flesh otherwise it'd be too easy you just have full dominion and you'll be doing whatever you'll do in the Millenium you'll be already doing anyway there'll be no resistance no enemies no squatters no troubles but there has to be a Time of Troubles a time of suffering a time of humiliation has brother been preached you know and and that's not a negative humiliation right they because that can be classed as a negative thing but it's actually a positive humility a positive suffering that will be found in the likeness of us amen if he had to go through it he the second Adam the new human race that was born had to suffer and learn obedience my the man Christ Jesus had to learn obedience I don't understand that to be honest I really don't let's just the best it blows my mind but he has to he had to and he did and he grew an appreciation and was able now to understand you to understand what you're going through and he took it and you know what I'll tell you what motivated him love divine love divine love motivated him to stand there and handle every nine tailwhip on his back the vinyl of motivated him to not crumble on the ground under the pain as his flesh fell to the earth as he suffered uncontrollably unmercifully more than any man or human ever suffered hallelujah he suffered more and he took it and I tell you it was love divine love that motivated him if that can motivate him to do that what will it do for you hallelujah when we can now take these tools you could say that the prophet has given us and the Scriptures has shown us to be able to we want to spur the love in our life you know because it's there you can't be separated from it but what the devil wants to do he wants you to get troubled in your spirit troubled in your flesh so that your so it's all just turmoil ash and tumultuous and you know and you get all upset and then you start turning to other streams of comfort because there's faster access to satisfaction but then the satisfaction never lasts and never lasts whatever it is that you would turn to but divine love if that can motivate a king to stand there and take that my divine love motivated him to receive every spit every thorn and his head every mock mockery it motivated him hallelujah if that love is so powerful and so simple and so strong that it could motivate him to take every hit to take all the shame to take all the reproach to hang naked on a cross oh my what will it do for us love is the most powerful motive that it is that in existence divine love love is the motive that drives the kingdom of God it's the key economic or whatever that the currency but the you know it's like a generator of life of action of of expression of of action divine love and we're going to live in a kingdom that's all about that amen it's gonna be out here but first let me encourage you let it be inside you first now let the whole economy inside you because there is an economy within you amen it's a civilization that's happening inside you amen it's not happening out here you it will one day and we'll be with them amen he'll take over he'll do the same thing out here that he's doing inside you now but the profit now if I get to it the profit gives us some keys to to to work not work it up we don't want to work up some emotional thing but but it needs to be that's like a relationship you need to work on it yeah you know you've got to actually give the Lord something to work with brother Branham says God will energize the vine but you got to do the work you got to do it you got to go and do it he'll energize you he'll give you the spirit he'll give you the anointing he'll give you the ability or give you the ghost he puts it all in there but there has to be an action on our part that's going to have fruit that's entering an and yielding getting still in saying Lord what is it what is it today Lord you know because this whole society is designed to busy us and get us caught up then we just have to say Lord you know and we get we get back into that channel and my my you know I've been so touched the Lord actually I'm taking a lot of faith here because you know I like to have notes and I like to have it mapped out but the Lord kind of basically was like you're not having notes for the service no notes and when he sung everybody wails like Lord you just want to speak you know he just wants to i've got quotes and that's it and some scriptures but no notes okay so Amen hallelujah it was a battle it was a battle man because you just you get inspiration could you pondering over these things and you're like wow that's amazing I just got to write it down no no they're not allowed to write it down I always use because you know when you're leading up to preaching or you're just developing thoughts and so you get something you like oh I gotta write that down otherwise you know you forget it and then the law was like hey I'm beyond that I'm greater than your memory amen let him speak hello let me speak hallelujah Amen hallelujah said the for the Lord has called thee for thy maker his own husband and the Lord of Hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called amen for the Lord has called thee as a woman Forsaken and grieved and spirit that's our old husband that we were married to forsaken a man grieved and spirit the spirit that realm that causes all the trouble in our life all those emotions and memories and affections and all that stuff causes trouble right and man but I believe and I'll read something that that can also be smitten you can let you know you can get solid love with him hallelujah let me just say it right now you can be so in love with him that your spirit just as smitten and it just can't doesn't need anything it doesn't need to go and last after they're all gone it's just so smitten not converted smitten hello yeah they're not smitten by law you can't smite it by law it just it aggravates your spirit she will find a way around it and you'll end up doing something else but if there's a love so strong if there's a love so you're smitten oh my and I'll tell you now your spirit is we win in the subconscious series when your spirit controls all the emotional feelings and and all their chemicals in your blood and all of the hormones in your life and all the cycles and all other Naturals things moods and all about right well if she's so smitten by love then you're gonna be feeling something you're gonna be in an atmosphere and when you hop out the car and you take your head off and walk up to brother Jack Moore's house and his daughter looks out the window start crying because of the atmosphere that's around you because the love that's inside you has an about it has an elder has an ability to be expressed you know because you're so often we find because of whatever experience we have and we get born again and we have a wonderful time for a while and then all of those troubles start setting in and it starts going like this in the devil weed he just wants to dumb you right down and told you no you're just sitting there and you're just going about the the week and you're doing those things and every now and again you have a nice little time and and then a convention happens and maybe you break out for a while and then it just comes back down again and he says come on come on just sleep now you know and this is this is this is what happened because you he doesn't want God's love to be so to smite you and your spirit and your flesh you see in your spirit there is five senses affections conscience memories reasons and imaginations five okay and in your flesh there are a see touch feel smell in here okay Tim senses right these are ten kings that when you were born on this earth come into this world speaking lies these ten kings ruled you and they will still try and rule you the Romans sixes or men I might read it actually just read them because there's a war and your flesh is going to try a revolution all the time the devil's going to try and find a way in he's a he's a he's a master of leverage and he looks for things and leverages you know who knows what leverages you use it as against someone you see a weakness and you'll use that to get leverage or say you're trying to strike a deal and you see that they want something you see there's a need and so you'll use that as leverage to get what you to convey your sales pitch or the devil will see are that person it's got a weakness there and that happened over there the other day he's got leverage right and he uses that as leverage to get in by the thoughts and by as fiery dots and this flesh these tin kings tin Kings that when you were born and a Babylonian rule that Babylonian ol nature then old husband that one that's we were under control of until the Lord came and they men you know the Lord went down into the hell and he kicked out the devil and took his keys Amen well he came down into your hell and took the devil and kicked that snake out of your heart and took the keys amen gave you eternal life hallelujah oh my let's let's read this Romans 6 I think it's verse 6 no it's not here it is Romans 6:15 it says here what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh because it's unconverted there's five senses but remember these are sixth sense right brother Brown says you get six senses faith and that sixth sense needs to take absolute benevolent leadership over those other senses now if you're an illegal istic form you will take malevolent you have to look this up but malevolent and benevolent leadership is the polar opposite to each other now they're both powerful leadership styles right they both have power and they both can rule the one rules with malevolence and law and hardship and uses draconian measures to control and this one here this one rules with love gentleness power and peace both have power both are very powerful forms of leadership but we need benevolent leadership all right because benevolent leadership allows the spirit to move it allows the people to be free to express failure so that they can be healed hey man and all many things but that this is the key to benevolent leadership and you will tell when there's benevolent leadership in a country in a person's life and a church and a you know you name it wherever it may be and you can tell where this malevolent leadership and I could it could be epitomized in North Korea right there is malevolent leadership that's a bad form of leadership and that's because Satan this what Satan does that's his style that's the way that he is he's like that and he wants to rule our life like there and he'll come in and it'll look real benevolent it'll look real nice it'll look like you're getting liberated but he really wants to get you so that you're under him draconian Lee here bad but benevolent leadership over because that benevolent leadership needs to be manifested and within our own life and how we as a person that is filled with the Holy Ghost that is walking with God and is about to be raptured how are we rolling over our own spirit how are we rolling over our flesh and we pushing it down under the law are we trying our best are we paying the commandments because it's the right thing to do are we singing songs and getting anointed and speaking faith because it's the right thing to do or be under a malevolence in our life and our spirit is actually crying for freedom it's crying to be expressed because it's not under the love it's not smitten by love and I believe that it's that will smite your spirit to keep you in a good place now I don't mean it doesn't mean you're going to not fail ever again but that's a good the love of God can do amazing things the love of God amen hallelujah hallelujah I need to get to this but I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and unto iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness sorry I forgot I need to go back I'm gonna go back a little bit because I think I missed something here I think it's verse 8 no here it is verse 6 it's not at six knowing that our old man knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin that were destroyed us to be made dormant it's to be rendered ineffective or unable to like a dormant volcano as not it's there and it's got potential to riot erupt but it doesn't erupt because there's been this dormant right now that is that's what that word destroyed there when you take it back to the Greek that the body of sin might be destroyed or might be made dormant because a king has entered your life and he is able now to administer leadership in your life so that you as a soul can rise up in Dominion now here that's where you come to a crossroads and you light now help what is the way to to overcome myself and you know we all go through a legalistic phase and we might even have legalistic cycles from being liberal too legalistic liberal to leave you listed but there is a balance there's a center there's a middle-of-the-road and I believe it's divine love truly divine love and you know this is the good thing right for us now we are under the ministry of the capstone so we have the full measure of divine love to come down upon us like no other Church ages ever head hallelujah no man and so we have an advantage now and the reason is because we're going to be raptured out of here hallelujah amen and so that's why we've been given open book divine access to perfect love in the full measure of it all amen and that divine love is already within you because you're born again and if you're not born again the altar is open amen hallelujah it's always open the altar is always open whether you're at home Church work wherever it may be the altar is open and you can be born again the Lord is waiting hallelujah that he may reign righteousness upon the fellow ground sometimes the ground gets a bit hard it needs to be broken up this is that in the book Hosea I think Hosea 12 13 or something but wake up the fellow ground he may come and reign righteousness upon you oh my let's just continue reading this romans 6 here now if we be dead with Christ for he that is dead is free from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death had no more dominion over him foreign that he died he died unto sin once but and that he liveth he liveth unto God and here's the one I wanted to visit living as the one says likewise Rick can you yourselves did indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body it wants to it wants to right and if and if there's a lack of it of God in your life if there's a lack of anointing in your life if there's a lack of fellowship in your life if there's a lack of free-flowing connection to the divine love of God then your flesh is going to look for something it's gonna start one wandering and you're gonna start needing other things but we have access divine access to the divine love of God behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone a rock of offense but to them that believe to be freed from shame that they could bring forth life that they could come into a love relationship hallelujah and it's that love that will connect you we can take this down if you want but this is that love that will connect you to the supernatural the manifestation of Jesus Christ is connected you're connected to that by divine love because he says this and it this is where this whole thing came from for me it says if you love me you'll keep my Commandments and I will manifest myself to you I will manifest myself to you that word manifest is a powerful word it means to reveal openly to to completely unveil who wants Jesus to be convenient to them he says I will love them and my father will love you and we will make our abode with you hallelujah he that loveth me he that agape me keepeth my Commandments now you know we can keep his Commandments alright but what is driving us what economy malevolence or benevolence and we're going to is it going to be is it he that sees that it's a good thing to do and it's going to make his life better and he's getting not go to hell keeps my Commandments or he that loveth me and so I see I see this and I'm like Lord okay here is to me is like this is the a very major key in our walk with the Lord that this love and I thought so much about it and prayed about it and he's unfolded many things and I've got and we'll move into the story of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and we'll see that the stone oh my but stone hallelujah you know when he comes down into our life you know what is he doing now you know daily bikinis with streamers encompassing an age it's encompassing the end of time it's encompassing you know major huge high-level visions for thousands of years but how does that affect me we need to make this personal this needs to connect we're at home right in our heart and it does and it has and it is and there's still things going on but what does it do you see the stone that the builders rejected you know I was so excited when Ben was preaching a because I'm studying this stuff deeply right now you know and really meditating on and he brings out that scripture there about the stone and Zion you know man you know I was just like man it's powerful real powerful because the stone Amen what he does is he comes he's cut out without hands and in the stone this capstone this headstone divine love comes and it strikes the feet of that image of the clay and the iron right the ten Kings the ten toes where does it hits the toes amen so here you have this image the stone that comes in and says it strikes it and then it breaks that image that Babylonian power that thing that's ruled and draconian measures over the earth and black horse rider white bread pale whatever all those powers that are deceived man and destroyed souls and and and always pharmaceutical evil people that try and control and greed and fear over the earth and keep people from God all of that the influence of it the power of it the stone comes and it spikes it and it blows it up hallelujah until it's blown away by the wind and that's what the Lord thinks of all of that and that's the power of our God and he will do that that's going to happen this earth is going to be rid of that Babylonian nightmare that nightmares gonna lose all is gonna be cast into the lake of fire amen with the false prophet amen and then we'll live happily ever after amen that's my favorite that's not a fairy tale but that's my whatever bedtime story that's a good bedtime story that's the real one amen huh that's what the gospel does that's our future and I said hey we think about that and we meditate on that you see and he's going to do that to the earth and to the age and to the dispensation but what about you now what's happening what were you born inside what was inside your heart brother Branham Caesar was a snake was born in there and it was overshadowed this predestined seed that was in there and that seed was lying in your heart dormant and then amen now under this ministry of Malachi 4 and under the the ministry and the revelation of the Son of Man here comes divine love himself at the end of time because it's a day that in the church those ten Kings need to be smitten because there's a people that need to get dominion over this bird and over their flesh once and for all but there's only one thing that can really give them a thorough consistent Dominion that's that smiting style that is you've got to be smitten amen now your heart smitten because he came in and he's coming and he comes in and he comes in his smite set image and he gets the devil and he gives him a good cook and he removes them from your life amen and smites those 10 kings of your life fights them so that you're smitten and I and I was like well that's awesome Lord I love that it's kind of like a vision right and it's explaining what's happening on a high level personally in our life right that's high level but how does it how does this really be practical how am I going to benefit from this because I'm still feeling like I'm failing all the time too much right and I'm still going this and then these things happen but what how does this become a practical thing in my life the smiting of that love in your heart now there's a relationship there is an accumulation that needs to take place right so that the love that's inside you and I I just see it all at the start anyway but I'll say it all again I see it at all I couldn't hold it in that love needs to just I can't stay in there has to go out it hits to start affecting you amen let me read something but just remember that we'll come back to this let not sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof and remember the key is not whether you let it or not it's with that's how even brother Branham says you notice he's like you know when he's preaching the Seventh Seal he's like he that he opens up a whole new idea of not when he's coming but how right cuz it's like Nike we know he's coming right everyone knows you're coming no one knows the day or the hour right and that can be debated all those things right but but how and when you realize when he reveals to you how that is like the absolute key and we're talking about it right now you know we're talking about that smiting stone coming down into your life to break Babylon out of you Babylon is still right now at that's a process right we see Daniel Nebuchadnezzar's vision and the interpretation and it all just kind of happens right and it's all just gone but that's not exactly how it would flesh out right it would be a process it would happen over years it'll happen over a lifetime it'll happen once he comes into your heart and I say let the one that just fall in love with him I'm trying to just say it I'm trying to and it's gonna all kind of unfold oh let me read a few things but just fall in love with them lay everything else aside until you have divine love there's a lot of responsibilities in our life a lot of other things these ministries there's all the gifts there's all the things that the Lord wants us to do but without divine love we are nothing it has to be motivated by divine love it has to be the very start of all motivation in your life and we really it's like okay if the Prophet says lay aside everything not most things but everything until you get divine love then I believe that there's a strong admonishing statement for us to really take heed to what a prophet is telling us and say you know what he's really like strongly Caesar and he says it over again he'd be emphasizes this so a lot lay aside everything until you have divine love until you can love everybody even the ones that are unlovable or whatever it may be even your worst enemies I love because what is that that is subduing your 10 Kings now you're never going to read them until you take a body change they're going to trouble but if there is such an atmosphere in your life because you're falling in love with them you take you've gone back to the rudiments of your relationship with God and said Lord I really want this you know I've done all of us and I've done all that and I've been there and I've fallen down here and I've shared my conscience there and I've gone back down that route and come back here and I've had that revival beer but Lord what about this love Lord I want this love to be so strong in my life Oh Lord I desire this love father to permeate my being I don't just want to hear and know about it Lord but I want to feel this love I want this love to be around me all the time I don't just want it to be something and like talk to me or I try and work it up alone let this love constantly and consistently radiate in my life so that my spirits become happy my human nature becomes satisfied by this love because it's perfect love and it's everything that we could ever want and brother Brown says is no human word or a way to describe how good it is and we have this like portion of it now has the down payment as the earnest of our inheritance the Holy Spirit divine love he went up there and beyond the curtain of time and he felt it and it's in a higher measure whether it was the full measure or whether it was a higher whatever it may be it was a lot stronger than here but you see when we get the Holy Ghost he comes down into our heart he comes down into our life he comes to smite that image Easter he comes to destroy Babylonian influence out of our life the power of it but he but you see when you receive the Holy Ghost he comes down to rule he comes down to teacher he comes down to bring you up he comes down so that within your life there is a need in it condition there is a you topic society going on inside you there is a place inside you that you could fellowship with them and that now that fellowship needs to have fruit that fellowship needs to go beyond theology it needs to go beyond works it needs to go beyond the in all performance and its go beyond everything you do and say but it needs to be reality it needs to have a fruit and unfertile seed and in seed as life that's how deep it needs to go and needs to get down deep inside amen and it can it's simple these things I'm saying to you they're very very simple but the Branham says this and the law having a shadow and 1956 when he was a prophet so if you're cons constantly on the up and down remember brother you've never correctly ever come to Jesus Christ yet if the Bible said love not the world neither the things of the world and if you love the world the love of God is not even in you in your life you're only emotionally mentally worked up with some kind of church entity or some kind of a theology that's been taught you and never in your life have you ever come face-to-face and met Jesus Christ you know this is a question that we need to really ask ourselves if we ever come face-to-face and met Jesus Christ and been born again for when you once fall in love with Christ the world dies right then for eternity hallelujah and he says here in 1955 and Abraham he says listen first you've got to be born again of the Spirit of God if you're not you'll never understand the Word of God God has said so God said I've had this Bible from the wise and prudent and will reveal it to babes such as will believe if you want to get anything from God just be a baby and open up the Bible fall in love with Jesus just fall in love with Jesus fall in love with him now this sounds real simple and you know we get a lot of the times and Ben's been heading on it a lot lately as you know we're try and it's like a rewards system type of thing and we if we do all of us and we and we achieve all these things and we become all us and you know and we're going to get something but it's actually we've already got it but now it's being able to Sisson you know you've got an arcade and you want to discover and you can discover people how do you really experience it where does it really become a reality to you if you love me you'll keep my Commandments divine love perfect love in your life that goes beyond the seed it's got a that's got to grow into something it's got to be it's got to be true it's got to come out it's got to grow into a fruitful tree because he says I'm the vine and the other branches and if you abide in me then you sure you will be pruned and then you'll be a much fruit amen and so there's this connection point when you come onto the vine and in the vine is the supernatural expression of God and let me tell you every person in the church is subject to all operations of the Holy Ghost not just a couple few people right every person amen who's born of the Spirit of God and even if you're not born of the Spirit of God he can still use you right but but you we should never rule ourself out from a supernatural experience with the Lord or to be used supernaturally but I believe that our motive I'm gonna walk around this pulpit untie our motive needs to be divine love through and through get down to the basics you know maybe you've never asked the Lord to really help you to love him and now this may come as a little shock but I believe this is a real this is true you know God has given us the ability to love on many levels right and even down down you know the devil will take and pervert that love and bring it into lust and bring it into all those perverted but if we just keep it from that threshold of of God's true godly levels of love from human love right up to agar P and and like so from friendship to you know husband and wife and you know I believe and I believe this is going to be something for our is that we can love him on all those levels because if we just love him on a divine levels too high level for us we can't even feel that properly because we we wouldn't to be destroyed we would disintegrate if that perfect love just was right like all over us right now your body could not fish just couldn't I have no brother but school was lost brother branham in a car and that was just another earnest he said he thought he could almost die because he said it one breast would take me into another dimension now I don't believe that was what it was fullness that was just more than maybe what we used to write and he said but their presence we're not made and so if that's all that we've got for the Lord and that's all that we're feeling in our experience then I believe we can ask the Lord Lord I want to love you with all the loves that I got I don't just want to love you and divine that because that's default that's in the predestined seed in your life it's already there and when it gets quickened it just gets more and more right it's like a love that just comes forth and you can't keep it's just like the alabaster box gets broken right and it pours out and you can't stop it till it's all empty all over his feet amen I break alabaster at your feet Lord amen but see now what how much can we love them if we love them with our friendship love and we love them with our philia love and we love them with our garper love so that all the love that's in us can be smitten can be consumed by him I believe it will take on a new your life will take on a different note a different song because you see we have a more ready access to feel your love we feel it more that love that you get smitten by when you first meet your spouse or you know that's a figlio love and and and you know there there there comes the time where that agape love starts to really it doesn't it doesn't it's always there right so it's there but you see this feeling of love as a vibration that we can really we can feel and we want to feel our religion and we want a heartfelt religion we don't just want some you know pie in the sky we want it to be heartfelt we want it to have a fruit and you know in it when it's really down deep inside you and it's flowing through you and it's all around you oh my your life will take on a different mount and you'll have more patience for people amen those grudges will just disappear that have been held against people because of some sort of thing that happened they just fade away it just fades off amen it fades away I can't so that's the water that's the oil they meant you know the oil is what causes the water to fall off the duck's back it's the oil it's the oil that cleans the Dove self-cleansing amen hallelujah that's what we need a bit of self cleansing amen it's the oil hallelujah and so you see you now you know if you've got a water the horse that takes you back to Isaac right the camel the camel train so you really need to start giving God some praise hello yeah you on the camera give God praise amen I can hear you by the way let's brother ninnie I know it you know because the Spirit of God is in you but he loves praise he loves to be worshipped he loves it when you remind him of us how good is a man when you sing with passion hallelujah amen ask the Lord Lord restore passion in my life for you amen we read about the Passion of Christ what it caused him to do and the love that was set before him he endured the shame took the cross because of you Amen hallelujah what drove him divine love what connects you to the supernatural divine love amen what would motivate you to keep his Commandments and and it would actually cause him to love you and really make his abode with you and you would see it in your life and there would be a manifestation of Jesus of the Father and your life is love perfect laughs and this is our inheritance and this is something as a child of God as the bride of Jesus Christ you can say like kayln give me my Mountain hallelujah amen because that stone now here it is here it is this just this just say it right now that stone comes into your heart but what did it what was the next part of the story it grew got watered by praise got watered by being reminded of what he's done for you how that Babylonian nature's not ruling over you anymore you've got freedom you got Liberty you can walk and freedom hallelujah and when you start to praise him based on these things and then that mountain starts to grow amen let that stone the builders rejected Amen didn't get rejected by you because you're praising him and he's growing and he's growing and he's becoming greater in your life what is becoming greater divine laughs that's divine love you know we pray and we ask the Lord for things I don't know what percentage we ask right but you know we ask for the Lord's for lots of things and I think there's a good thing it's a very good thing we don't always get it right but you know when you strike a chord with him and you know I've just asked the right thing and he comes down and he says yes and that's why I'd be waiting for you to us they don't know how long he's been waiting but he's been waiting for you to ask that I believe when you can ask the Lord out of a sincere heart and you prepare yourself and he's there and he's you know he's come there and used to say you know you know when you've got an audience right and you just know the Lord is there and you're having a fellowship and it's like you know when you ask that you've just you just believe you know it's just the atmosphere and you just say Lord you know I really I want all the loves of me to love you I want to love you Lord so that Lord it doesn't just remain inside but that mountain would just Lord fill my whole earth I want my whole earth to be filled I want all that Kings to be smitten hallelujah but if I love a man I want all the ten Kings to be under a cloud nine experience a man who knows what cloud nine knows amen well why don't you just put those ten Kings under cloud nine right now that's my kind of administration amen amen that's it against a good administration amen you know when a church gets under that administration there's nothing that's impossible right now you know that because there is a love the Spirit of God is happy because he is that love and he's being magnified hallelujah amen well I think we've gone over time so I'm gonna leave it there hallelujah but I must say that is a differently to be continued we will continue on that one day because man honestly well being or no it's never-ending a man amen can we have the musicians please I just want to you know why we're in this atmosphere you know maybe there's somebody here or on the tape or even if you're listening later on and and maybe the love you you know that you could love God more and maybe you've let other things into your life then as comforting you or giving you peace that the world can give but not but you see Jesus says I give you peace that the world cannot give and and you know if you want to access to that piece and you want access to faith remember there's the scripture in Galatians 5 it says that that that love works faith amen and so you see when this love becomes so preeminent in your life and that mountain that smitten all of those kings and you're coming under that influence and it's really affecting you you know this is going to make a real change and and that love because you see we all long to see the supernatural we all longed to be freed from the desire to watch YouTube or watch movies or or do whatever it is that the devil has given us or some you know out-of-balance thing right we want to be free from that but you see and we want but we need to be connected to the supernatural we need to be connected to the one that would say I manifest myself I mean if you love me he that loveth me keepeth my Commandments John 14 read it later he said I've got it right in front of me why don't just say it so this is here he that he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so you see now here is somebody who's got the the stone inside him and they love him and they realize oh I've got all these things that's happened and there's a war going on but here is divine love and now it's time for divine love to be and I want I just want to I want to feel this love I want more than just a teaching of it I just I don't want to just see it in other people but I want it in my life then tonight you can make that happen by surrendering more amen you know the Lord he rebuked the Ephesians Church H because they left their first love that church that church age began when they left their first love did you know that that's where the church age began because before that they were in eternal realms they were led by the spirit they were up in perfect love but then they left it and the Ephesians church age began but he said you know to come back and do the first works he said but it takes the humility it takes a heartfelt repentance and and really ask the Lord tonight Lord let's let's just pray before we hand the service over to brother Edie and if you want to be remembered in prayer you do so by just acknowledging the Lord just put your hand up to him and and just pray with us Lord Jesus father Lord we don't want to serve these 10 kings but father you've given us Lord a smiting stone in our life you sent the son of man you seen Elijah Lord you said there you came of clouds Lord Lord you sent a mighty message in this day to declare Lord the revelation of the Son of man that smiting stone that would come into our life and it would take over and you would grow and you would grow and Lord you would take over Lord so that our faith could rise because your love would bring it up Lord you would give us rapture and condition Lord you would bring us out you would deliver us from our enemies and Lord we just want to remind you of how good you are and how faithful you've been and Lord Jesus I just asked you now father and the name of Jesus Christ that you would renew that perfect love and me that Lord you would Lord let me love you with all the love that's in me Lord not just far the Lord that divine love which is needed and which is perfect Lord but Lord that I could really contact that love and I could really love love you with all of those that's within me Lord then it wouldn't just be Lord high-leveled father it wouldn't just be a theological reason it wouldn't just be not a positional little thing but Lord I would experience the love Lord we want to experience your love Lord for we know Lord Jesus that Lord that would motivate us Lord that would bring some German that would bring father and Mileva benevolent leader that we would be able laughs I love to lead Lord in our life phone that we would be able to take control of our spirit Lord not because we have too long not under some legalistic regime Lord but under divine love Lord that's what makes the change this is what makes the difference Lord and we want access to their tonight father that that smiting stole Lord would just grow I ask Lord that you would increase I pray Lord that law that government in our life others increase shall there be no end that government that one that wonderful counsellor that's the one that can subdue our spirit with divine love that's the one that can come into the outer courts of our life and out into our flesh and Lord it can just bring peace but not the world can give law but what you can give and we need that tonight Lord and father there's somebody that's out there or in here Lord Jesus that needs to be Lord of revival that needs a love tonight I pray you would give it Lord wherever they're at Lord I can't see the Lord but you can you know what's going on in every life you know this desires lot of your children's hearts Lord I pray father that they would come a supernatural or God and that we would see fruit tonight Lord Jesus that we would see Lord a lasting consistent change and the people Lord or the fussing would leave all the grudge's would go unforgiveness would be broken Oh God Jesus by love Lord love that permeates our being that comes into our flesh comes into our spirit Lord Oh God Lord Jesus I call on your name and I ask Lord that you attach every life touch my life Lord I need you Lord I need more of your love I need Lord Jesus that to be the only the motive of my life well God Oh God hallelujah oh Jesus have your way father we love you commit these things to you take all these words and reveal them to us Lord how Lord you would desire Lord and what you want said and done let it be in the name of Jesus Christ god
