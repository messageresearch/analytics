forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone hallelujah well god bless you friends good to see everyone out tonight uh we're gonna listen to a portion of christ as a mystery god revealed um we're gonna go just as that's getting ready to go so we're listening through the seals brother brown says in the seventh seal that there's a there's a threefold unveiling of it and then if you really want to know what the seventh seal is listen to christ i miss you god revealed we know it's unfold in other places too but there's a three-fold uh unveiling of the seventh seal in here i don't know if i um let me just see i'm not sure sorry if it's in this portion of tape but brother bam says that um well i'll just see if i can find it quickly he says this here i'll find it okay so this is from oh it is in this message but he says here he says now god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has kept it all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour now that's the seventh seal if you read just revelations 8 1. and the seventh and thunders out of their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed it yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't and he says no he has showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now on this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help will see it right here this morning what god what the lord had in his mind all along and has expressed it so it's not a mystery that silence is actually being manifested amen which is the coming of the lord and we know the seventh seal it's all the end of time end of sin end of struggling nature into the devil end of all those things but we're caught up in that end of all things i remember what i love about the seventh seal is that is that god is actually revealing christ where it's christ being unveiled it's christ unveiled in you and i yeah right and it's actually part of the end of all things is the end of sins dominion in you it's part of the unfolding i mean so i pray that you you may have heard this many times but i pray that lord will just anchor it into your heart the reality of what what is happening what we're going to listen to tonight is not something that was 60 years ago whatever or history or knowledge it's actually happening it's happening your life is expressing what the prophet is preaching about here so um let's just bow he's in a word of prayer then we'll just listen to this portion then we're gonna have a time of prayer afterwards but it's about he's in a word of prayer gracious father we thank you for your word lord how it's no longer just in book form lord or on tape or father it's living lord because you are your word you're a living god and lord you've put on flesh once again lord in this end time lord you've veiled yourself lord by your great grace lord behind our humanity lord we so glad we're knowing that the purpose of calvary is that you would you would forgive us and cleanse us all of our sins that you would dwell in a people that you would live and walk and move and speak and act through them and lord i believe by your supreme grace we are part of that redeemed number and i pray as we hear your word tonight mate just anchor into our hearts may you have your way lord as we have sung may have your way o god fill our hearts oh god and just have your way and not just not just in this service lord but i pray when we walk out these doors every moment of every day may you have your way in our lives grounded father we want to commit the service into your hands lord those who couldn't be here lord we just want to be mindful of them be their portion lord be where they are lord want to commit ourselves into your hands and we thank you for this opportunity to be gathered together in jesus christ's name amen amen amen your friends you may have your seats and um and then while we read this beginning with i want you when you go home to read the entire chapter of these colossians but i want you to read this morning with me from the 15th verse uh 29th inclusive and i'll just be as patient as you can or i feel that in this year if god will help me we'll reveal and bring into your mind all these other things that i have talked on all through the days of the tabernacle why i have said what i've said and why i have done what i have done this is why now from the 15th verse who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible invisible where they be thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the primitive for it please the father that in him should be all fullness dwell should all fullness dwell let me put a little emphasis on that again this 19th verse for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things and to himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven watch where that reconciliation went and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works you now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable approvable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not be moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven world of i paul made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is bound behind all the affections of christ in flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hidden from age from generation but now is made manifest to his saints i want to read that verse again even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we might present every man perfect in christ jesus or unto our also labor striving according to the working which worketh in me mightily now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text up on the entire bible but i want to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god reveal now i took it in order as a sunday school lesson so we could all read together and and uh have this fellowship together now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive and doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous messages i have tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels begin to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there was no sun there's no moon no stars no nothing then he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundations of the world i think when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy now where were you see that's way back before the earth now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly that you see i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's reason under our seventh um uh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they won't know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret that's reason they were silenced in heaven for a space for a half hour and seven thunders uh their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the of the believers in the bible has been entitled and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to the people see and then you don't i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me now if you want to mark this down i've got so many places i want to read from and now in in the book of saint luke the 24th chapter of saint luke we find out it's it is the two of the apostles on the road to emmaus and jesus stepped out after his resurrection and they were on the road to over to emmaus going along the road thinking and talking and weeping on account of his his death and how they seen him suffer for what they thought was of no value at all they took their lord and crucified him and and they were going along that weeping and he stepped out from the roadside and began to talk to them about christ he said oh fools and slow to understand don't you know that all the prophets and the psalms see what was he doing identifying himself to these apostles that all of the prophets and all of the psalms and everything was him expressed see and now the reason i never talked to preach this morning was because i thought in teaching we would understand it better than just to take a text and skip over it we just teach it he was saying that all the psalms and all the prophets spoke of him well therefore that shows that all of the old testament all of the new testament and all of the psalms the singing the songs that were sung were sung of him take the 22nd psalm and sing it and compare it with the morning of the crucifixion see my god my god why is thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my feet and my hands yet all those things are them singing that psalm down there in the temple and crucifying the very onesie see those great religious leaders those great man those great teachers and yet so blinded that was reading the prophets and was singing the songs and doing the crime that they said they would do the same thing is taking place this morning now listen close cause i ain't gonna even pay attention to what that clock says i want you to get this thing i want you to see so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that god had in his mind he hid it from all of those scholars and just a number a selected predestinated number a predestinated people was the only ones that heard i now search back the scripture down through the age of the prophets and see if it wasn't the same thing now at jesus christ referring them to the prophets and the psalms he said they all spoke of him see and here these jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law professors have did exactly like they had done before now notice again he said search the scriptures for they are they that testify me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures what am i trying to do to show you that this bible is the thing that's right the other day standing in a hospital room talking a sister had asked me to explain about the nominations why we was against denominations uh with some denominational people you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is god and jesus declaring the same here that the word is him you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word awards with god and the word was god and the word made flesh amen now here he says search the scriptures they testify me in them you think you have eternal life that's true and they are the ones that bear record of me and i'm bearing record of them and if i do not the works has promised that i would do that don't hear me but if i do the works and you can't believe me believe the works because they testify that he is the word oh it looks like it couldn't be any plainer then all right now search the scriptures he said moses and all the laws and so forth and the prophets and psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him he is the principal theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ and every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there's christ see every from that to the amen in revelations is every word testifying of jesus christ that's why these added books that are called the second book of daniel and the book of the maccabees uh uh adds purgatory and stuff like that see it's not spoken of in the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to place purgatory in there there's no place to place intersection of saints and things there's no place in there for that there's no place for denomination there's no place for for creeds outside of the bible so when you see those things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people has added those and got their their their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up they can't make it right same yesterday and forever but if the things put together right there's the entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation god's whole plan revealed right in jesus christ amen that's the whole picture set together every little crooked corner it's just like no i don't mean to be sacrilegious by this but it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today it looks horrible say we are believers the cow picking grass up on top of the tree don't work that's when they say yeah he's every way but just of a certain he's saying yesterday and forever all but a certain thing see then you ruin your picture the bible said he is the same saint john 5 or saint john 14 12 he said he he anybody he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also well that was for another age there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert for fish and a bunch of hot sand well there's no fish i had see see you've got to bring him back to where he's fishing at galilee where there's plenty of fish you see you you got to make the picture look right it's god's great picture and there's only one way you'll see it that when you see jesus christ there's the entire bible he's the principal theme of the bible now you realize that any of these places here you could take a text that's just hard for a preacher to hold his peace you look like you want to keep going with it but you got to get back to what we're teaching on he is the principal theme of the bible he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history of the bible the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find christ he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history and he also in the bible is the things that is to come so he was before and after what does that making then the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday and forever brother lee where do you go to you got an awful picture there for he was the history see and he is the prophet he is the psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything and the same what's your picture look like do you see it all right he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 if you're writing it down he should be then he should be the principal if that's what he is and we believe it don't we yesterday then if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in us then he should be the principal theme of everything that we do say our thing amen should be christ amen that right all right since we think this since he's been made the head of all things to us that colossians said so here he's the head of all things to us for he was made for us which we are considered all things he said what about the sinner he was made to be the judge of the sinner if he don't accept it he was made the glory for the believer who does accept it so their thing all things was made by him and for him and it takes the night to express the glory of the day it takes the vessel of dishonor to express the the love and care for the vessel of the honor it takes an evil woman that would wear immoral clothes and and cellar morals to express the virtue of a decent genuine lady it takes a crook and a thief in a man to express the genuineness of a real believer a real christian it takes a hypocrite to show up the believer what he is so all things was made by him and since he was made all thing made for all of us all things was made far by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us we should be identified with him how by living for him not just a confession so many people take a confession say i say it's got to this place now are you a christian i'm methodist well that's a long ways from being making yourself known as a christian oh look what the methodist does i'm baptist look what the baptist does i'm catholic look what they do see but the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you how we got some a stinger there i hope everybody on the tape gets that too you say i'm pentecostal that don't mean a thing it's christ identified in you that's when he has recognized you so i spoke of tongues devils does too i shouted the mohammedans buddhas and everything shouts the indians scream at the snake dance they there are they all do cults clans and everything else scream and holly holler and shallow the baseball game but when christ is identified in you identifying yourself saying you are christ-like which the word christian means to be christ-like [Music] there's your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him notice god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret god in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it and now what we want to go up on this morning is what is that threefold purpose i believe by the help of the of god who's present and he'll show it to us um now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space time and eternity he could not is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did began that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of life space and on out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood or he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son a man that's reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he's talking about many of them but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh my oh no this this is rich to me just even think of it see see what god's purpose was now why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could be a father there that's true but also he's the savior you say how do you know he was he is because i've had the experience amen he is a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through christ how could he be a son only through christ how could he be healer only through christ see all things are wound up in that one person jesus christ oh my god now when i when i think of it i i just see denominations passed off the scene everything else is going to when i see god's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the premises the oversight the leading another of the night if he didn't get the tape i preached there one night on a prisoner of jesus christ paul a prisoner see when god gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do paul with all his great intellects he taught he was taught by germain to be a great a priest or rabbi someday and he had high invasions he was intellectually a great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express jesus christ he knowed what it was to say uh he had an ocean to go someplace some brethren called him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will oh if if people have spiritual can pick that up he was forbidden to do his own will he only could do the spirit forbid me he was a prisoner to christ then this little fortune teller one day who you know paul know he had power to cast that devil out but he could only do it as god willed it day after day she followed him crying out after him but one day the spirit gave him permission then he rebuked her the spirit that was in her see he knowed what it was to be a prisoner moses his intellectuals he had to lose them in order to find christ to be a prisoner that when god got all the world beat out of him and all this uh mighty man that he wasn't standing the presence of that a pillar of fire that day he was found speechless he didn't even he couldn't even talk he said god had a prisoner then see you won't try it to your own searching then god had to do this man or endow him with power enough that he could go down there and he said lord i told pharaoh what you said and he wouldn't do it he said then take this thou rock god speaking that's god's word go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and flies come into creation because he had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else can turn him knowing he was a complete prisoner in the chains of god's word bound up only to thus saith the lord oh god can get his prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence you see he he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ you get what i mean all right that's secondly first to express itself completely god in christ second to have the premises by this in his church which is his body of the bride so he could have the premise to express himself through them all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them and now sin and death had separated them from his presence we're going to keep going through this but go listen to it isn't that wonderful guys looking for prisoners paul was forbidden to do his own will look at the magnitude of that he couldn't even do what he wanted to do because he's such a prisoner that lord said no don't go there he said yes lord i won't go there even though he wanted to go there we could be like that prisoners to the spirit of god amen um praise the lord so you see here that um this is the beginning of the threefold mystery under the seventh seal that's being unfolded in the sermon aren't you glad that there's no
