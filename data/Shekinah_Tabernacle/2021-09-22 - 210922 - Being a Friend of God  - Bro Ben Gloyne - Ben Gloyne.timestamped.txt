[26:53] sorry if all the young people who are at
[26:55] the banquet I I I spoke on this I just
[26:58] couldn't get it off my heart so the best
[26:59] way to get off my heart is to tell you
[27:01] about it and then we can move on so
[27:03] um I just feel to uh continue on in this
[27:06] vein uh about being a friend of God so I
[27:09] you know as always things always come
[27:10] out differently so uh don't don't
[27:13] um hit snooze if you're there so in
[27:16] James 2 and 23 and we're just going to
[27:18] read one one verse here James 2 and 23.
[27:22] um and it's a prayer night tonight as
[27:24] well so um we have a time of prayer
[27:26] after this so James 2 and 23 it says
[27:29] here and the scripture was fulfilled
[27:32] which saith Abraham believed God and it
[27:34] was reputed unto him for righteousness
[27:36] and he was called the friend of God Amen
[27:40] my what a what a thing to be known as
[27:44] right may the Lord bless the reading of
[27:46] his word you may have your seats tonight
[27:47] so I want to talk about being a friend
[27:49] of God you know we
[27:52] um
[27:53] I don't know how you view God uh many
[27:56] people have a very wrong idea of her of
[27:58] him even even brother Branham would say
[28:01] uh early on in his Christian experience
[28:03] he'd say you know he says I used to
[28:05] think that God was angry with me but
[28:07] Christ loved me
[28:09] and I come to find out that Christ is
[28:10] the very Heart Of God he is God's heart
[28:12] Jesus Christ is God's heart now love
[28:15] overcome love hides sin or gets rid of
[28:17] sin God so loved the world that he gave
[28:19] his only begotten son that whosoever
[28:21] believeth on him shall not perish but
[28:22] have everlasting life amen so he so
[28:25] brother babe used to think that God was
[28:27] angry with him but Christ loved him and
[28:29] you know what a what a sad condition to
[28:32] be in if you think God is angry at you
[28:34] you know you know imagine waking up
[28:36] every morning thinking this this being
[28:38] that you're going to pray to is mad at
[28:39] you you know but I'm so thankful that we
[28:42] don't have to live under that with that
[28:44] kind of relationship God God doesn't
[28:46] want us to think of him that way it's
[28:48] really man's idea of God or the devil
[28:51] perverting who God is to the people that
[28:53] makes people think that God is angry you
[28:55] know at them but God is not angry at
[28:58] people you know remember Jesus Christ is
[29:00] the very Heart Of God he wants a real
[29:02] relationship a love relationship with
[29:04] you not one that's just based on like a
[29:06] job or some kind of servanthood he
[29:08] doesn't want somebody wants sonship Sons
[29:10] and Daughters of God made co-equal with
[29:13] him that's what he wants and you know so
[29:15] so I trust you do not think that God is
[29:17] angry at you you don't think of him some
[29:19] angry father that's always correcting
[29:20] and lecturing and beating down and
[29:22] that's not the kind of God of that
[29:24] that's not the god of the scripture
[29:25] that's not the god of the message either
[29:27] he no it's it's it's Sovereign Grace
[29:29] it's divine grace being projected you
[29:32] know you know it's the love of God being
[29:34] expressed that's really what you know
[29:36] that's the heart of the scripture is
[29:38] divine love
[29:40] so he used to think of God being angry
[29:42] with him but he found you know Christ
[29:43] loving him he found out Christ is the
[29:45] very Heart Of God so I trust that you'll
[29:48] um uh uh you you you'll see that you
[29:50] know he's not a angry fathers I'm just
[29:52] laboring this point because many people
[29:54] are scared of God they think of you know
[29:56] people are terrified of going into
[29:58] Rapture because they're going to stand
[29:59] before an Angry God but you know no
[30:01] that's the most exciting thought to be
[30:02] you know these bodies have changed and
[30:04] then we get to see Jesus you know some
[30:06] people are terrified how's it going to
[30:08] work out over there well if it if it's
[30:10] fine here it's going to be fine there so
[30:12] you know if you've given your whole life
[30:13] to him he's changed you transformed you
[30:15] made you a new creature in him amen the
[30:18] love of God has shed abroad in your
[30:19] heart it'll be the same over there right
[30:21] so it's good to get these things settled
[30:23] here that you'll be right over there hey
[30:26] man so you know friendship can be
[30:29] you know has has many different layers
[30:31] and
[30:32] um you know we know that a true husband
[30:33] or wife they should be best friends with
[30:35] each other yeah first and foremost you
[30:37] should be enjoy hanging out with your
[30:39] spouse like me if I have the whole day
[30:41] with Christine that's that's a great day
[30:43] that's an awesome day well if we just
[30:45] sit on the couch and have coffee after
[30:46] coffee it's a brilliant day yeah yeah
[30:48] tick I'm I'm a happy man because I get
[30:51] to hang out with my best friend amen and
[30:53] and that's just gotten more and more
[30:54] since since I've been married to
[30:56] whatever it's just got better and richer
[30:58] and that's how it should be so so it's
[31:00] not just a kind of a casual kind of a
[31:02] friendship but it's a but but you know a
[31:05] real to be a friend of God you know he
[31:06] wants to have a real good friendship
[31:08] with you you know he doesn't we know
[31:10] some friendships are difficult he's had
[31:12] a difficult friendship before where it's
[31:14] actually all kind of one-sided you know
[31:16] and it's normally because one of the
[31:19] friends is very insecure
[31:21] they're not secure on their friendship
[31:22] you know they'll get insecure if you
[31:24] don't call them enough or text them
[31:25] enough or and you know invite them
[31:27] enough you know they see photos of you
[31:29] status of photos of you doing something
[31:31] with someone else and they get offended
[31:32] why didn't you invite me on that trip
[31:34] why why am I not in that selfie you know
[31:36] you know and it's an insecure kind of a
[31:39] friendship now our God is not insecure
[31:41] he's very secure he knows who he is he
[31:44] knows he made all things he knows from
[31:45] the end from the beginning he's very
[31:46] secure right so so it's only can be our
[31:50] side is insecure but our Lord wants us
[31:52] to be secure in this friendship he
[31:54] doesn't want us to be insecure well what
[31:56] is that insecurity am I going to make it
[31:58] am I not going to make it he wants to
[31:59] get that out of your head or get that
[32:01] out of your heart he wants you to know
[32:03] that you know that you know that you're
[32:04] going and you're gonna make it because
[32:06] remember he made it for us at down
[32:07] Calvary but he wants that Victory to
[32:10] come into your life that you could just
[32:11] have such a peace in your life no matter
[32:13] what happens you're under the blood and
[32:16] you are his child and he's your God
[32:17] that's what he wants you to know not
[32:20] guessing but knowing right because you
[32:22] know when Jesus hung there on Calvary
[32:25] and he purchased the Redemption of of
[32:27] Adam's Fallen race of you and I he
[32:29] carried our sins up his shoulders up
[32:31] there you know that day of Calvary he
[32:33] was our sin offering he was our lamb
[32:36] when he said it is finished he wasn't
[32:38] doubting it was finished or not it was
[32:40] finished he knew it was paid in full he
[32:42] knew that this wasn't just a down
[32:44] payment or some interest or you know no
[32:45] it was paid in full that all of Adam's
[32:49] Fallen race could go free I mean they
[32:51] could be redeemed back to God so in his
[32:53] mind the sentence question is settled
[32:55] but as it settled in your mind
[32:58] Hallelujah right see it's going to be
[33:00] settled in your mind that he paid it all
[33:02] for you right because if it's not
[33:04] settled in your mind you'll try and earn
[33:05] the friendship buy things you can do but
[33:08] that's not how it works no he paid it
[33:10] all he just receive it and enjoy it and
[33:11] walk in it amen right because he paid it
[33:14] all we you know he knew that we could
[33:16] not keep our half of the friendship
[33:18] right because remember he put Adam on
[33:20] condition if they'll you know don't eat
[33:22] this tree if you do this is gonna happen
[33:23] he failed you know he gave he gave
[33:25] Israel the law don't do this if you do
[33:27] this you'll do you know this is going to
[33:28] happen they failed but with Abraham was
[33:31] unconditional Covenant I've made you
[33:33] father of Nations and he made him father
[33:34] of Nations and the Covenant that we're
[33:36] under under the blood of Jesus Christ is
[33:38] unconditional right he puts a faith in
[33:41] our heart to fulfill the word right
[33:43] that's not nothing we could do but we're
[33:44] going to surrender ourselves completely
[33:46] to him
[33:47] right we can't hold anything back you're
[33:49] gonna give it all yeah
[33:51] amen and let him come and be not just
[33:53] savior but Lord amen amen of your life
[33:55] let him control you let his word govern
[33:57] you above all things above how you feel
[34:00] what you think the things you know let
[34:02] the word govern you
[34:03] amen so you know some some friendships
[34:06] are very insecure you're like you never
[34:08] text me you never call me you know and
[34:10] it and it feels like it's just work you
[34:12] got to try and maintain this friendship
[34:14] and you've got to be careful how you you
[34:16] know act around that person act around
[34:18] that friend because you're going to
[34:19] offend them if you do something wrong
[34:20] you can't be yourself necessarily you
[34:23] know that's not a real friendship
[34:25] you know a real friendship is you can be
[34:27] yourself
[34:28] what's in all you can be yourself and
[34:31] they enjoy you for you right they don't
[34:34] enjoy you for for some idea of who you
[34:36] are they enjoy you for you that's a real
[34:39] friendship you don't have to put on a
[34:40] Persona you don't have to try and dress
[34:42] up or impress them or or use a different
[34:45] kind of vocabulary you can be yourself
[34:47] right that's a real kind of friendship
[34:50] amen and that's the kind of friendship
[34:52] that God wants with you and I he wants
[34:55] us to be ourselves remember this
[34:57] remember the gospel is not like a cookie
[35:00] cutter kind of thing or just a machine
[35:01] that God puts us in a mold and we come
[35:03] out we're all just all the same you know
[35:05] doing the same speaking the same and you
[35:07] know having the same kind of character
[35:09] no he made you because he wanted to be a
[35:11] friend with you so if you're so if
[35:14] you're very loud he enjoys a loud friend
[35:16] if you're quiet he enjoys a quiet friend
[35:18] if you're somewhere in the middle he
[35:19] enjoys that kind of a friend but because
[35:21] he wants to be you he wants to be a
[35:23] friend with you
[35:25] he made you to be you if he didn't want
[35:27] you to be you who he would have made you
[35:29] someone else
[35:30] there's no mistakes with God
[35:32] right so you know a real friend you
[35:35] enjoy that person for who they are
[35:38] not what they have
[35:40] many people will be your friend because
[35:42] you throw money around
[35:43] those aren't friends they just want a
[35:46] free drink or something that's what
[35:47] they're after they're not really friends
[35:48] I had friends like that in the world
[35:50] wasn't too good
[35:52] amen but real friends will stick with
[35:55] you yeah
[35:56] amen bro you know the Bible says that a
[36:00] friend loveth at all times and a brother
[36:02] is born for adversity so a friend loveth
[36:05] at all times now our lord Jesus the
[36:07] Bible says when we were his enemy he
[36:09] died for us so he was our friend when we
[36:11] were his enemy we weren't even friends
[36:13] we were enemies because of sin nature
[36:16] Made Us totally contrary to him so when
[36:19] we were has that when we were against
[36:21] him he loved us at all times he loved
[36:24] you when you were lost he loved you and
[36:26] you were trying to please him out of
[36:28] your own Works he still loved you he
[36:30] loved you when you failed he loved you
[36:31] when you said the wrong thing he loved
[36:33] you when you put your foot out of the
[36:34] line he did all kinds of wrong things
[36:36] and you're eating yourself up saying I
[36:38] can't believe I did that and but we know
[36:40] he's saying lord well he's not praying
[36:42] because he knows but he's like maybe
[36:43] they just learn
[36:44] and grow
[36:46] and become more like me right but you
[36:49] know he loves you at all times a real
[36:51] friend will love him in the good times
[36:53] you're loving the bad times or she'll
[36:55] loving the bad times and the in between
[36:56] times when you're not doing your best
[36:58] they're still their best they still love
[37:01] you anyway
[37:02] right so our lord Jesus his love is
[37:04] constant it's not based on anything see
[37:07] his love does not change based on our
[37:10] what we do yeah that's right our love I
[37:13] could I could know you I mean or hear
[37:15] about you say you are the greatest
[37:17] person in all the world or vice versa I
[37:19] can hear about you and so I'm staying a
[37:21] mile away from that person I need a
[37:23] restraining order you know I don't I've
[37:25] never met them but they're that scary I
[37:26] don't want to know them so I've got
[37:28] virtually no love for you right human
[37:30] love but then when I meet you and you
[37:32] begin to talk with me and we do stuff
[37:33] together I say man this person's awesome
[37:35] and what happens my love for you goes up
[37:37] right it goes up based on what you do
[37:39] how you treat me but then God's love
[37:42] doesn't change that way his love is
[37:44] constant
[37:45] praise the Lord and I'm so glad that
[37:47] that's that is our way otherwise he'll
[37:48] be like he's not coming into my presence
[37:53] I'll be honest but you know
[37:56] but our Lord our Lord's love is is
[37:58] constant it's great it's far above human
[38:00] love that changes like the weather amen
[38:04] amen
[38:06] now Friends of the same character
[38:09] come together
[38:11] birds of a feather flock together right
[38:15] so those of the same spirit will gather
[38:17] themselves together I can't remember who
[38:19] said it but but if you want to see who
[38:21] you are see who your friends are
[38:24] right because your friends show Who You
[38:26] Are
[38:27] right so if your friends
[38:29] uh
[38:30] you're a bit that way but if your
[38:31] friends are awesome well maybe you're
[38:33] awesome too
[38:34] because birds of a feather flock
[38:36] together see the character of your
[38:38] friends and you see your own character
[38:39] because birds of a feather flock
[38:41] together
[38:43] oh my so so the Lord wants to be friends
[38:46] with those who are like him and the only
[38:48] way you can have that true friendship is
[38:50] if his own Spirit comes into you changes
[38:52] your nature and now it's him living and
[38:54] not you praise the Lord but see his
[38:57] friendship wins us over to become his
[38:59] friend
[39:00] right because what happens is Once Upon
[39:02] a Time Calvary was just a story
[39:05] right it was just a historical maybe
[39:07] happen story The Resurrection who knows
[39:09] you know but then one day he came and
[39:11] met you and you know the tomb's open and
[39:14] empty not because you see a photo on
[39:15] Google but because you've met the
[39:17] resurrected one right so so he wins your
[39:20] friendship over by proving himself who
[39:21] he is to you and then then once you see
[39:24] him that way how can you not give your
[39:26] whole life amen amen as he heals the
[39:29] sick raises the dead you know castes out
[39:31] Devils how can you not just say Lord
[39:32] you're awesome I want to be like you
[39:35] change my heart to be like your word
[39:37] Lord
[39:38] amen Proverbs 22 and 11 says he that
[39:41] love loveth
[39:42] pureness of heart for the grace of his
[39:45] lips the king shall be his friends so
[39:48] those who love the pureness of heart
[39:51] who loves the pureness of heart amen we
[39:55] don't love Shady deals or things that
[39:56] are perverse or not right we love the
[39:58] pureness of heart I mean so for the
[40:00] grace of his lips the king shall be his
[40:03] friend so what comes out of their mouth
[40:05] the king himself will be their friend
[40:08] and when I read that I thought thought
[40:09] of the syrophoenician woman that Greek
[40:11] woman who came and she had a daughter
[40:13] grievously vexed with the devil and she
[40:15] came to the Lord she had a faith that
[40:17] she knew if she just got to him amen
[40:19] that that Spirit would be cast out she
[40:21] just had to get to him but you know and
[40:23] and her faith faced a lot of obstacle
[40:26] well she faced a lot of obstacles
[40:28] because the disciples said go away and
[40:30] even Jesus himself said to her well said
[40:33] to his disciples to tell her you know
[40:34] I'm not even sent to her she's not even
[40:36] no this is this is wrong you're not
[40:39] welcome
[40:40] you know but so she had obstacles but
[40:42] her faith had no obstacles she her faith
[40:45] carried her through those things
[40:47] and she said you know I'm not even you
[40:50] know you know um the Lord called her a
[40:52] dog saying you know you're not even meet
[40:54] for the you know you know the crumbs
[40:55] just go down to the dogs and all those
[40:57] things and calling her a dog but then
[40:59] she said true Lord but at least the dogs
[41:02] get their Crumbs from the table I may be
[41:04] butchering the scripture but we but you
[41:06] know what I mean right and so so her her
[41:08] lips had Grace on them because you came
[41:12] with the right approach right she came
[41:14] in humbleness of heart
[41:16] right and he said for the saying you
[41:18] know you'll find your daughter as well
[41:21] right so the king became her friend
[41:24] praise the lord we want to have that
[41:26] kind of friendship don't we we said Lord
[41:28] I have this need and even if he seems to
[41:30] say no and knows as good as a yes right
[41:33] and maybe cut us very deep hurt us a lot
[41:35] we maybe have a lot of sadness
[41:36] associated with it but if he says no we
[41:40] can still rejoice
[41:43] amen right that's real Faith yeah when
[41:46] you've when you've done all you can but
[41:48] yet it seems like your prayers not
[41:49] answered but you still love them anyhow
[41:51] that's real Faith amen
[41:54] amen maybe it's quite a mouthful to say
[41:56] but it's true
[41:58] right we don't have faith just because
[41:59] he answers prayer brother Ram says it's
[42:01] easy to have faith when you see
[42:02] mountains moving but when nothing seems
[42:04] to happen
[42:05] and you still love him anyhow amen
[42:07] that's real faith I want to have that
[42:09] kind of faith
[42:10] amen you know a friend can come and
[42:14] really talk to another friend about deep
[42:17] issues some things that can cut a real
[42:21] friend feels they have the Liberty they
[42:23] can come to you and talk to you about
[42:24] things they don't just keep the
[42:26] friendship surface they can go down into
[42:29] real meaty things that are going on they
[42:31] can really just say it out because
[42:33] they're not afraid to lose the
[42:35] Friendship if you keep a friendship
[42:36] surface level it's because your
[42:38] friendship's not a real friendship it's
[42:39] just an acquaintance you can say hey
[42:41] buddy buddy hey friend but it's just
[42:42] surface and because a real surface
[42:44] friendship is no deep connection
[42:46] you know it's just a it's just an
[42:48] acquaintance you know but if but many
[42:52] people keep things surfaces because
[42:54] they're afraid the Friendship might fall
[42:55] apart or they're even afraid to go to a
[42:57] deeper friendship
[42:58] but the thing is a real friend can just
[43:01] speak things straight and they know
[43:04] their friend will actually be able to
[43:06] receive it
[43:09] it says in Proverbs 27 and 6 faithful
[43:11] are the wounds of a friend but the
[43:13] kisses of an enemy are deceitful so
[43:16] faithful are the wounds of a friend so
[43:18] the wounds of a friend as if they come
[43:20] to you and they say hey
[43:21] why'd you do that
[43:23] I saw how you treated that person
[43:26] I see pride in your life something's not
[43:28] quite right here you're the D you've
[43:30] changed how you speak to people's
[43:32] different hey your attitude something's
[43:35] crept into your life oh yes
[43:37] you know they can really and and that's
[43:39] wounding
[43:41] that's wounding but but any surgery
[43:43] leaves a wound
[43:45] any any surgery even even pinhole
[43:48] surgery there's still a lot of pain
[43:49] there yeah because the needles have been
[43:51] in and things have moved around and you
[43:53] know there's a wound but there's still a
[43:54] surgery had to take place and when a
[43:56] friend can go to a friend and say hey
[43:59] good that's not right
[44:01] we have to talk about this
[44:04] and a real friend will sit there and
[44:06] talk till the Matter's done
[44:08] doesn't matter if they get better
[44:09] they're going to say no no hold on we
[44:11] need to really talk and then pray this
[44:12] through yes see and that's why the law
[44:15] can come with his word if you're a real
[44:17] friend he can come to you and say hey
[44:18] I'm not looking at anyone in particular
[44:20] when I say this yeah you're prideful
[44:22] brother yo you become arrogant you've
[44:25] lost your love for people you've
[44:26] hardened your heart you know you've you
[44:27] think you're above everyone you know
[44:29] look at how you treat people you think
[44:30] you're holier than now yeah he'll come
[44:32] to you and what does he do he wants to
[44:34] actually cut the devil up from your life
[44:36] you know he said he why why are you
[44:39] harboring that complex why are you
[44:40] holding on to that pain you know I need
[44:42] to do some surgery
[44:44] the Lord but because he's your friend he
[44:46] can come to and actually talk to you in
[44:47] that manner because he loves you right a
[44:49] real friend that loves won't let their
[44:51] friend just go off and go on and to sin
[44:53] they'll say hold on
[44:55] this is not right and if you want if you
[44:58] won't listen to me I'm going to get some
[45:00] heavier artillery I'll get my I'll get
[45:02] our parents involved I'll get someone
[45:04] else involved because I love you
[45:07] you know because even Cain asked God am
[45:09] I My Brother's Keeper and yes you are
[45:11] yes we are our Brother's Keeper if you
[45:14] see some if you see me go wrong please
[45:15] talk to me about it
[45:18] thank you I'm glad Brother Paul's got my
[45:20] back see he's my friend brother and
[45:22] Paul's my friend some of you I'm not
[45:23] sure yet but hey we need to work on this
[45:26] all right we're going to do some outings
[45:27] or something
[45:29] all right but you know but it should be
[45:32] that way
[45:32] irrespective of office blah blah blah no
[45:36] that doesn't really matter oh man
[45:37] friendship goes beyond that remember to
[45:39] respect to be a respecter of persons is
[45:42] sin she said well I can't talk to that
[45:45] person because they're that personality
[45:46] that's respecting them but I can talk to
[45:48] the other person about that's fine no
[45:49] that's respecting one person above
[45:50] another we should treat each other the
[45:52] same
[45:54] respect officers all those things but
[45:56] hey if I if if my foot's out of line
[46:00] come talk to me about it please I know
[46:03] I'm serious I'm not saying this
[46:04] flippingly I mean it right and then I'll
[46:07] say actually thank you actually value me
[46:08] as a good friend
[46:10] amen
[46:14] amen now a real friend knows the nature
[46:17] of the other friend
[46:18] Abraham that was our opening scripture
[46:20] was he said that he was a you know he's
[46:22] called the friend of God
[46:24] now brother Brown would say and who is
[46:25] this he'd say he'd say what if Abraham
[46:28] would have took what it looked like 25
[46:29] years waiting for a promise that God
[46:31] gave him why he'd never had the baby
[46:33] that have never they'd never have um
[46:35] been the father of little Isaac but he
[46:37] believed God's word and wouldn't turn it
[46:39] loose but he watered it day and night
[46:41] strong giving praise unto God oh when
[46:43] Sarah was saying honey it's been 25
[46:45] years ago since the promise was made
[46:47] here I'm nearly a hundred he'd say
[46:49] praise God we're going to have it anyhow
[46:51] because God said so and that settles it
[46:53] that's right he knowed the nature of God
[46:55] because he was a friend of God so he
[46:59] knew the nature of God that when God
[47:01] gives a promise he's going to fulfill
[47:02] that promise well because it was a
[47:04] revelation to Abraham they're going to
[47:06] have the promised son so because it was
[47:08] a revelation he he and he knew God is a
[47:11] god of his word he knew God was going to
[47:13] fulfill that because he knew the nature
[47:16] of God because he was a friend of God I
[47:18] trust we know God above the letter right
[47:21] I trust we know God above just but other
[47:24] band's voice on tape right but we know
[47:26] the voice behind the voice we see the
[47:27] heart of God Amen being expressed
[47:31] because a lot of people who don't know
[47:33] the heart of God they'll take isolated
[47:35] quotes and scriptures take it totally
[47:37] out of context and away they go but
[47:40] those who know the True Heart Of God
[47:41] don't get swayed by those things because
[47:43] they know the whole character of God
[47:45] Amen
[47:47] amen amen praise the Lord amen
[47:51] it's like for example there was a there
[47:54] was a Lutheran Minister during the Nazi
[47:56] era and he actually was killed by the
[47:58] Nazis he was a he was a German by the
[48:00] name of a Dietrich Bonhoeffer and and
[48:03] and here's a Lutheran Minister very
[48:05] smart man and and he was he was there in
[48:08] the Lutheran Church when the Lutheran
[48:10] Church got swung into Nazism and he
[48:12] stood dead against it and because the
[48:14] Nazis were trying to get the church on
[48:16] board not because they were Christian at
[48:17] all but because they wanted the control
[48:18] because the Lutheran Church even even
[48:20] Luther's Bible had a massive sway over
[48:23] the German Nation because he unified the
[48:25] German language it was a very powerful
[48:27] you know part of their history and so
[48:29] they knew if they could swing the
[48:30] Lutheran Church into Nazism they had the
[48:32] country and so so little by little they
[48:35] did because that Spirit came in and just
[48:37] swung them into it because at first they
[48:39] would have you know you know within the
[48:41] Lutheran Church there there were there
[48:42] were Jewish believers who became
[48:44] Christians but they're Jewish by Blood
[48:46] but they became Christians then the
[48:48] Nazis came in and they and they and they
[48:49] and they tried to make the church change
[48:51] their change your list of beliefs saying
[48:53] you cannot have Jewish Christians they
[48:55] are not allowed in the Lutheran church
[48:57] anymore but he stood dead against this
[48:59] verse so but what the Nazis did is they
[49:02] found a bit of Luther's writings where
[49:03] he was actually anti-semitic and they
[49:06] blasted that Across the Nation saying
[49:07] look Luther said this therefore we
[49:09] should do this but it didn't sway people
[49:12] like uh Bonhoeffer because he knew all
[49:15] of Luther's writings
[49:17] so he knew the whole heart of Luther
[49:19] right so if you really know the whole
[49:22] heart of God yes or the whole heart of
[49:24] the message you don't get swayed by
[49:26] isolated quotes and things that are
[49:27] taken out of context she has to sway you
[49:29] out of it
[49:30] you see this you know so we've got to
[49:32] know the heart of God Amen
[49:35] amen right but unfortunately other
[49:36] people they said oh really he said that
[49:39] then it swung it into them but that
[49:41] Spirit had to come and do what it did
[49:43] but anyway he died he was actually he
[49:45] was actually executed by the Nazis at
[49:47] the end of the war for standing against
[49:48] what they were doing
[49:50] but you see because he really knew all
[49:52] of that Luther taught all of his
[49:54] writings he wasn't swayed by isolated
[49:56] quotes yeah
[49:58] and it should be the same thing with us
[49:59] if we really know the heart of God
[50:02] then isolated parts of the message won't
[50:04] sway us or isolated scriptures right
[50:06] amen so we've got to know the nature of
[50:08] God now sometimes
[50:10] you know if we really know the nature of
[50:12] God we can rest when God appears to be
[50:15] silent
[50:16] right we can rest when he appears to be
[50:18] silent we can trust no matter what
[50:20] happens if we've made Brothers one of
[50:22] the most powerful things in the world is
[50:25] a full committed God when he fully
[50:28] commits something to God when you father
[50:29] give it to him like a sacrifice that's
[50:32] powerful because now it's in God's hands
[50:33] amen and he can do what he sees as the
[50:36] best thing to do amen and if we're
[50:39] really his friend and know his nature we
[50:40] can rest at whatever happens in life you
[50:43] know he has our best interest in mind
[50:46] this is not just sitting back like a
[50:48] fatalistic kind of idea like what will
[50:50] be will be no if your life is in his
[50:52] hands completely then what comes you can
[50:55] rest in it
[50:56] good and bad you can rest in that
[50:59] amen so I think I'm gonna just wrap it
[51:02] up there because this is a prayer night
[51:04] but I want to ask you the question as
[51:06] your friendship with God now now a good
[51:08] friend you love to be around
[51:10] it's not work you enjoy there
[51:13] presence you enjoy their company you and
[51:16] and a good friendship is if you can
[51:19] basically you know you spend time with
[51:20] that friend and you may not see them for
[51:23] however long it could be years even and
[51:25] then you see them again it's just like
[51:26] you hit pause and now you put play again
[51:28] and you're back together
[51:29] that's a good friendship right it's not
[51:31] like Oh Where Do We Go From Here and
[51:33] where do we no no it's like you never
[51:35] were apart yeah because you're a good
[51:37] friend it's the same thing with us and
[51:39] God now we should never be apart from
[51:41] him right but but but but we can
[51:43] actually enjoy we you know a real good
[51:46] friend enjoys his presence it's not you
[51:49] know a friendship you got to work at so
[51:51] it's not you know if if you your
[51:53] relationship with the Lord is it takes
[51:55] work like it takes work to read the
[51:57] Bible or if it takes work or effort to
[51:59] come to church or it's work or effort to
[52:01] pray or listen to the message that's not
[52:03] the friendship that God wants with you
[52:05] he wants you to enjoy it
[52:09] just like a real good friend that you
[52:10] enjoy their presence you love to be
[52:12] around them it's like when you open the
[52:13] scripture you enjoy it
[52:15] you know you pray you enjoy it you know
[52:17] you come to church you enjoy it you long
[52:19] to do it because you want to be in his
[52:21] presence you and right so so I trust
[52:24] that that is how your friendship is with
[52:26] him it's not work
[52:28] right it's not something well it's
[52:30] expected of me you're like a friend that
[52:31] takes work well it's expected me I need
[52:33] to text him today you look at whatsapp
[52:35] now I'm not saying I do this some people
[52:37] do they look at the words happen they
[52:38] say where's the last time I messaged my
[52:39] friend this friend because if I don't
[52:41] measure them within three days they're
[52:43] not going to be happy with me you know
[52:44] it's not that kind of Friendship with
[52:46] God it's because you want to
[52:48] right it's like sometimes now I'm not
[52:50] saying this happens to me but you know
[52:52] you get a call on the phone
[52:53] and you see the name
[52:55] and you've got to steady yourself before
[52:57] you answer
[53:00] these are those kind of phone calls
