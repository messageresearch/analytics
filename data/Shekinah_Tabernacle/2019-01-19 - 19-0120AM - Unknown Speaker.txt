thank God this morning for the beautiful light thank you brother what a beautiful light we're walking in hallelujah reminds me of a brother BAM says that as you walk in the light you become the light remind me of brother Paul Moffitt preaching in our convention one day was saying you'll be you are changed by beholding behold the word look in the middle of the word by and by your being changed by the word and likewise as we walk in the light this beautiful light likewise by and by we will become the light brother and when we become the light there's no darkness can't prevail can't be around you can't stand you because you have become the light may God bless you this morning can we pray father we are thankful this morning that we are the light of the world Bible says a city set on a hill cannot be hid neither doesn't man light a candle and put it on a Lord God on a bushel but he puts on the candlestick and we so thankful this evening this morning that we have become the light Lord your prophet when God when you drew out made that world and the moon made it up blackened it out it took a prophet to come and put a sliver of light in there knowing that there will be seeds lying in the earth waiting to hear the voice and to feel the hot sun shining on on that seeds my god and we've got we had to come forth because it was life within us and this morning we are so grateful that for the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ Lord it has illuminated our hearts and our minds we no longer walking in darkness we are walking in the light of the world and we say thank you this morning we ask of you Lord take over this morning help me to say something that would be rad to your people the needs uuu I don't know the needs but you know and I just want to surrender to you lord if this is man speaking it's just gonna be another meeting but God when you speak this morning it can meet the needs it can change hearts and lives we will never be the same again after today or every time in other word we can never be the same my God because we are being changed by the power of the word so this morning we say thank you for this time I to bless us now as we commit this meeting or into your hands and we say thank you for allowing us to be here this weekend we give you the praise and the honor and the glory Lord in Jesus precious name Amen god bless you can we just turn to Isaiah 55 it's good to be here thank you brother Ben and the church for having us here amen I came down to rest a bit but somebody opened his mouth and said that I will be yeah and so yeah I'm finally a men so I had to do it because I'm expecting your pastor to do it back in Auckland too so we are just so happy to be here and we really appreciate the fellowship those that just had some beautiful fellowship during the course of this week and we also have been so blessed by the caliber of people in in Wellington in Stoke Valley we have been tremendously blessed and the food and the fellowship sorry brother nd we brother ended he never gave me my chop he never gave it yet brother so will you please deal with him amens Isaiah 55 we all know this portion of scripture verse 9 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and Turner's not Dida but it water at the earth and make it is bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish I think I like God at work accomplish that which I have which I please and it shall prosper in the thing we're on to I sent it and then Joel - Joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former and moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer were my great army which I sent amongst you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that I have done John dealt bountifully wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed maybe God this reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of God I just want to read the scripture here in the book of Ephesians which is a little bit what I wanna speak on this morning in chapter 5 verse 25 and I'm not going to talk about marriage husband love your wives you should know that I don't have to tell you that amen husband love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he may sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word verse 27 that he may present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish and they god bless the reading of his word to our hearts I was listening to that song Kim and Amy was saying how big my god is amen and I was listening to a minister the other day and it was saying that God he's a good God but then he added something that took my attention he says that's only an aspect God is a good god that's only an aspect of God that's not God that's an aspect of God the same as we say God is a healer that's an aspect of who he is but brother my God is greater than that my god is mightier than that Bible says brother that he set on the room of the earth he made an amazing earth his footstool my god sits on the room of the earth and brother and his feet is upon this world and that's his footstool my God is big hallelujah and brother is so big but yet so little we can look within our hearts how big is our God how big is his name is the mighty one he's forever the same he hold of the waters brother I thank God that I know him hallelujah came to know him in 1960 make some make some sums hallelujah but you know I thank God this morning and I can speak on a little thought this morning God has predestinated for himself a glorious Holy Ghost fell Church right here in hell rather to challenge the devil that's why I'm here he's ordained before this hour and this season and this time rather he has ordained me to give the devil nightmares [Applause] every time he sees you every time you roll out of bed then he scuttles and he runs and he is coward because why a son of God and a daughter of God hallelujah is back on their feet so doesn't matter brother this morning what you look like doesn't matter how you feel God's Word says he's can I have a bride he's gonna have a bride brother and I'm so grateful this morning and part of that bride but the man says in questions in answers and in the message law having grace law having a shadow and he says his words he says remember friend this glorious church that we have been talking about this last week he says why can't we have it yeah 113 George Street Stokes Valley no heart I challenge you if that church has been predestinated to be a why can't it be why can't it be a hallelujah he says we've got the qualifications we've got the people who love God don't you believe that hallelujah now wouldn't you like to have a real Bible Church that's a question where the venom is asking now wouldn't you like to have a real Bible Church hallelujah a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be wouldn't that be wonderful brother and this is happening not going to happening right now right now there's a bright brother right now there's a church right here now hallelujah oh my now you have to make you going to have to make some sacrifices amen to have that made manifests to live in your church in your home in your job you will have to make some sacrifices amen not money he says you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're going to have to sacrifice something you're sometimes in prayer that's a very scarce commodity they ever ever ever the enemy attacks you he's attacking you right there in your prayer life you know pray lie but that's why he attacks you and that doesn't matter who we are he attacks us hallelujah Thank You amen so he attacks you on our prayer life and brother BAM says you're going to sacrifice some time in prayer you're going to have to maybe sacrifice your stubborn wall to great gun humility he says you're going to have to sacrifice he says the whole Christian move is cross brother he says is sacrificial opens a church to serve God to serve God to really serve God hallelujah is not for sissies not for sissies is not for those with a weak backbone take some men and some woman to serve God to say no to say no I'm not gonna do it That's not me rather that's kind of person that God can rely and depend upon not some wishy-washy we can all quote we can all sing our hymns we can all say we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother that's easy to say that but when it comes to when the rubber hits the road when you have to say no hallelujah when the ones you hang out with try to get you away try to make you to compromise on your principles God is calling such men and women that can stand and having done all to stand then stand having your loins girded about with truth rather having the full armor of God on that's the only way that me and you all be able to overcome and live a victorious life daily we can we can live a victorious life daily we can we can't say no we can declare and say Sun has got no more dominion over me no more I am no longer under the rulership brother of that former guy that helped me captive no longer no longer devil hallelujah brother there are times chance that you will have to talk to the devil you will have to draw him to an invisible line in the sand and you will have to talk to him and tell him you are not touching my children telling him you're not having my son you're not having my daughter you will have to you will have to do it hallelujah it might be brother you will have to point your finger in his nose and he shoves his finger in your nose at the end of the day brother he will have to back up hallelujah too long brother have we as God's people live below our god-given rights to long as he has been the one that rules your home your marriage your family life time it we should stand up for our rights hallelujah brother that's that's the church he's going to have that's the church he's going to have hallelu well not going to is heading Amen hallelujah hallelujah so brother thus walk brother BAM says it's a sacrificial everyday Paul says he died daily every day he died and brother and brother bands as I pray God it will become a perfect to this church that this church may become perfected in the love of Christ that this will be a place that people will come from around the world to come in here and see the glorious operation and harmony of the Spirit you have to say that this church in stoke Valley it's gonna be the place where people are gonna fly into residences hungry hearts hungry hearts is gonna come here why because it's a love rejected why the gifts of the Holy Ghost is in operation it's set in order hallelujah rather the devil don't care how high you jump doesn't care how much you scream doesn't matter brother but what brothers can scare him off is a life is a life hallelujah amen let your life Thunder out in sweetness in meekness in an undefiled life that will be a thunder against the enemy that will make him back off when he sees the life so scream shout that's part of it emotions that part of it sobbing and boohoo that's part of it but when you walk away from this if I don't live right brother then that's all in vain hallelujah hallelujah you know what brother BAM says when the Holy Ghost poured out on the day of Pentecost I mean it poured out on the day of Pentecost he says the devil was lying on his back nice cross cigarette in his mouth that didn't disturb him when they were carrying on and drunken was wine and brother but when the man at the temple beautiful hallelujah when that man at the temple beautiful received his healing that is when the devil sat up and took notice hallelujah why because it was another people doing what they mastered it and he thought he thought that he did away with that when they crucified Christ and buried him he thought it was over the Bible says if only he knew that when he crucified the Prince of Peace if only he knew that out of that death burial there was going to be a resurrection and me and our youth a merely you he never knew when he crucified Christ never knew that he was going to me and you and a bride upon this earth brother hallelujah 2019 a bride hallelujah upon the earth brother year Enoch hot valley I don't know where you get that name so I thank God brother this kind of people he says this is gonna be such manifestations when sinners will walk into the building and the Holy Spirit will be so dominating in here though they were weeping and walk up to the altar and give their lives to Christ brother that is the church that is coming for not a church that quote not the church that can give you the volumes and the years and the books and line of the messages but we love project itself rather it is Zen when God that's gonna send them in brother bands all you need to do get the atmosphere right then Eagles will be born just get the atmosphere right music that's fine singing or good that's part of it but rather the atmosphere of love divine love agape love that love is not what I can do that's a love what God does when God does things in my life and your life oh my sis brother that's the way it's gonna be amen God will make every Church on the face of the earth like that and that the world may know that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead and loving today amongst his people praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah got a quote here from I'm talking the resume of the church ages now this is gonna be the church that's gonna be yeah hallelujah this church is not going to be like the Ephesians church well though brother brand says he's restoring us back there's going to be another Ephesians in notice here quote there's maybe another Ephesians but brother Wayne this church come to its pinnacle it's gonna be like it wasn't after Pentecost he says now the birth of the church was at Pentecost he said as the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a bride pure and fresh I think occurs and she remains separate and undefiled for some time the Bible says how long after Pentecost how about the people we know the people lived off the Pentecost we're not talking higher the first church page because brother BAM says when that first church age Ephesians came on the scene she was a ready a fallen woman she was already defiled so somewhere between the birth of the ephesian church age and Pentecost there was a span of time then that the bride was really manifesting what Christ was there was love program says that when someone heard that a brother or a sister was taken captive he said the believer said let us go down to them and die with him that was the love that was between that period and brother Branham says he doesn't know for how long that space was that a church that was birthed at Pentecost live and undefiled life but somewhere the enemy slip him so this little church does bride it we are talking about this morning when God is going to fully display his power in her she will not going to be like a defeated search page because the official church age I have somewhat against you you've left your first love but not this bride brother when she comes to the pinnacle regard expresses himself in his fullness in her must remember that that dead bride we're talking about the Bible says that no man just add himself to that church people were fearful to come beyond the doors of the church people were fearful because of the gifts because of the power of God because of the Holy Ghost calling out son this is what I'm praying our church that God that you will even if you call out my name but one thing I know then you know about me God you're aware of me that's why you calling my name ready I'm what pleased with you and I know brother he knows about me and the prophet of God see that's the kind of church he's gonna have just before the rapture just before the rapture we're gonna have that kind of church we can have that kind of people hallelu because that is the church brother that he's ordained for himself she will burn out sparks without wrinkle without blemish without any such things that's the church brother hallelujah and he says and the Lord added to that church daily that should be say this is how long this continued we do not know but one day even as he was tempted and seduced by Satan so this glorious wonderful church was contaminated by the ant entrance of the Antichrist spirit the brother BAM says that Antichrist spirit will manifest himself in three manners will make a former will make you powerless will make you look 1 now you have to decide in your life right now where do you forget where do you 50 formal countries your hands can't say Amen don't tell me brother that's your nature your nature should have been changed don't tell me that's the work that's the way you are no you can't tell me that you can't raise your hands and worship God then an antichrist spirit I scraped into your life if you are powerless Antichrist spirit if you are powerless that you don't have power to withstand the enemy you don't have power brother to say no Antichrist spirit I scraped in I still come to church I still love brother Branham but brother if you are powerless where God has ordained you to be powerful and you are powerless and the enemy overrides you and the enemy gets you to brother to do what he wants you to do then the Antichrist spirit look one look one they want to go there brother but do you know each one of us know how I was ten years ago when I first saw the light and what I am now each one of us know right now how my life is with God my standing and if I'm just on fire for God as I was in 1960 am I still on fire for God am I still just as enthused with God as I was yeah this is the hour that we living in I mean I feel sorry for our young people truly do because I have an idea what you go through I miss a posture you talk to young men and you deal with him and you realize the challenges they face but God is able it does not matter what the devil throws at you God not you not you not not me not us God is able to keep me clean God is able to keep me unspotted from the world God is able to keep me holy because the holy God living in me hallelujah church we are talking this morning about a bride of Jesus Christ that's what we're talking about this morning and she is going to walk upon this earth brother before the rapture before the rapture she's gonna the Beast displayed she don't need to be displayed after the rapture but before the rapture this world will once again feel the shaking feel the vibration of a little bride she's not much to look at she might not be even be great in numbers but she is going to shake this world once more why do you think the enemy is trying to make you look 1 why is he trying to inject because no one of us are immune to the odors here there's not one of us that's immune to the odors here that spirit not one of us that's why it takes a me and you are consecrated a dedicated and sincere life to be able to oak to combat see subtle she is a very brother she am Albie Albie Albie eighty into his time eighty some of you twenty five thirty some of you but let me tell you something the devil has got over six thousand years experience and he knows exactly you think your imagine you think you are a match to that guy we are no match brother no match but brother let me tell you this morning where the BAM says he says brother the kingdom of God it's in you when he was on the cross he said I can call legions of angels and brother BAM says when the kingdom of God comes into you this is legions powers authorities is in you or that he had access to I have access to hallelujah so legions brother the host of heaven brother everything in heaven it's in me right now that's the reason why we have power brother to overcome the enemy that's why we have power to say no you young people I'm gonna tell you God is able if you want to Amen God is able God is able amen to keep you God is able to make you victorious hallelujah so brother this is what we've this is where we are at Amen that there's gonna be a church there is a church right now on the earth maybe you don't even realize who you are but I trust God may help you this morning that you might realize who you are who you really are brother hallelujah the quote I like very much and this is a spirit that's gonna be in the church at that now it should be he says the devil is trying to keep us separated don't put your head in the same face up to it and say yeah the devil is trying to do that keep us separated keep us fighting he's gonna shooting at one another he says he's got an open target anyway he wants to shoot and what's the use of me shooting what sorry what's the use of him shooting we are shooting one another so he just sit back and relax but listen to this but he says let me give you just tell you something now this is my quote this is my quote I love it it's really helped me he says if I have found grace in your sight through God he says you take my word for this brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely justly brother BAM says I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he has done you evil brother BAM is trying to explain this he says he's done you evil don't mention that who's there who's there anybody done you evil anybody said something bad about you don't tell anybody oh my he says don't mention that you take him to pray before God and don't take it in a way of just selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father away a prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father here's my brother he justly deserves punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let God go to talking to you you're standing out with your brother or your sister in the presence of God shoulder to shoulder not him standing you stand yeah stand with him shoulder to shoulder and say Lord my brother my sister has done me evil I don't deserve it I did nothing but he's done me evil name brother brems is you God lifts you tell him what your brother or your sister has done then brother Sam brother branches after you have spat out your accusations and what is done brother Burns is now let God talk to you let God now tell you about that man's life how he grew up how he was abused how he was treated in his youth how he was scarred but the band says leave God now tell you about this man and why the devil is twist-up posted him up and caused him to do that though is absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of God you'll be speech you will be feeling sorry for that man before you leave the throne of God you will feel sorry for that man and you will be sympathizing with that brother now listen to this and when you get back down to earth again where were you with your brother your brother brems is when you get back down to earth again so you couldn't have been here you had to be up of prayer and intercession to be able to stand with somebody that's hurt you that broke your influence that destroyed your character this is when you get back down again to earth you'll go over to that brother shake his hand because you know what he's been through he says you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemned anybody this is I don't believe that even if he is a rank son now you realize why brother Branham says in teaching on Moses if you have ought against sinner or saint you are in danger of hellfire amen brother Anini Sunnah or st. you see many time we treat Sunnis different to what we treat brothers yet they should be no distinction we shouldn't actual fact loved a sinner more than we love a saint loving a saint that just happens you'll just love him but to love a guy where the babes is when a guy insult your wife many time I think of these things and you realize you reminder how will you react how will you react that's the reason why Paul speaks about first Corinthians 30th it doesn't call it love cause a charity because that is something else that you can love Bible says charity is long-suffering me and you our charity can go so far just might go far but there's gonna come an end to my annual charity and then we are going to react can I hear amen we are going to react and many times we react in a very unchristian manner because the prophet of God is with the Holy Ghost now I want to let you know what the Holy Ghost you and I are shackled to an outside guy we are shackled to a flesh guy this flesh guy hasn't got the Holy Ghost this flesh guy brother he hasn't got the Holy Ghost this flesh guy has got the ability to rise up and to be very unkind what the Holy Ghost this flesh guy has the ability brother to be angry that's what I many times says brother if the split guy is not brought into subjection to the inner man this flesh guy can push you so far that you can kill someone what the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost got you some mind battles now I got some mind because how can it be what the whole brother branham's is that snake nature it's with you when you receive the Holy Ghost he says you and I are two people they sir there's a hateful guy this guy really is hateful is mean gets angry this guy this guy almost caused me to kinamania in New Zealand this guy this guy I can push you beyond the boundaries if you don't let this guy be brought under subjection to this guy inside of you what cause brother branham to pull a gun it I'm gonna kill someone did they have the Holy Ghost what cause Dee so me and you Church shackled to the dead man shackled to this guy this guy you bring him to church be such next to it to you and you wanna worship and this guy keeps your arm down this guy doesn't feel like worshiping this guy doesn't feel like saying Amen this guy don't want to do anything to help to further the kingdom of God this guy is always the guy brother when you ask him to do anything for the things of God he's always got an excuse this guy this guy like Paul Paul in prison was shackled to a person a god that watched over him and that person you just have to read the history that person was with Paul all the time when Paul had to write then that guy was there that's why they called the book of it Philippians the bow of the clanging chains when Paul write it I might know him when Paul wrote those precious things brother he was shackled to what a god that kept him so in Paul want to worship he had to fight with this God to raise his arms likewise in church this guy keeps you from really doing for God what the inner man wants to do so you fight no one the pause is I die daily every day a little bit brother you can you have to overcome him you will have to tell him who you are you will have to tell him I'm a son of God you will have to tell him you are no longer control over me you will have to tell him you no longer the boss I'm the boss the inside man is the boss you will have to tell him because if you were not going to tell him church he's going to tell you who you are you're a weakling he's gonna tell you you're not a Christian he's gonna tell you look what you did there and there and what you thought and what you did I said I saw you going on internet I saw you watching that girl he's gonna tell you this especially when you come to church and brother Bin's is how you brother god bless you brother Ben I'm all good and he will let you know uh-huh you filthy hypocrite you will have to tell him yes I know I know I failed but I'm still a son yes I fight yes I failed but I'm still a son of God I know what happened to me I know what happened to me the 14th of December down in whizzer places can a day huh or if some of you forgotten already what happened I mean the Holy Ghost poured out and you are on your knees crying to God I will remind you prick of conscience because the enemy is going to challenge you so you stand up you man up and you say I remember I've got a tie post I've got a hitching post this is what happened to me this is my testimony yes I failed yes I made mistakes but something happened to me I'm no longer what I was hallelujah you will have to talk to him you'll have to hallelujah oh my so brother band says what about a brother I don't believe you can't can't condemn anybody even if it's a ranks honor what about a brother that has made a mistake what about a brother that's made a mistake this is going to be in this church God is busy getting a people ready to display the attributes of God hallelujah hallelujah oh she's gonna be a glorious church brother she's gonna be a restored Church brother Mannis is a church like it was at Pentecost a church I said that when a brother heard another brother has been arrested they would say let me go die with him that's the kind of love that God will restore in this church oh he's busy doing a hallelujah you're in Stoke Valley brother it will be nothing short of that kind of love a love that can be with your brother I love a brother that can bear with the weaknesses of another brother Bay with the weaknesses of another brother this is what I'm talking about I'm talking about a love this morning Church all that I can forgive a person I can forgive some without that person asking me to forgive him I can forgive him without him asking me that's the way Jesus did it Father forgive them they know not what they do Father forgive them brother that that love is gonna be in the church that love is gonna be in the church hallelujah hallelujah all my problem we're talking about turning the other cheek turning the other cheek turning the other cheek Oh Oh Lord Jesus help us no God I'm not there yet save me when someone push you someone pushed you someone push you and you can turn the other cheek and you can say I'll go with you the extra mile and I can say take my under this also we talking about what the Alpha Church had before she became contaminated with the Antichrist spirit this is what we are talking about this morning are you there brother Freddy I can see it singing through your mind are you they know no nd I'm nothing but I'm telling you one thing I'm gonna be I'm gonna be there hallelujah praise His Holy Name I'm gonna be there brother every day I fight every day I fight I am not rolling over I am NOT saying kick me a devil because you've been picking me here so much so kick me yeah no no sir I fight him I fight him I punch him he punch I punch he punch but he never flaws me I flaw him hallelujah hallelujah yes sir this we talking about the realities man I'm not talking about quotes I'm talking about real things that you and I face every day some of our young people are going to uni some of our young people are going to high school and we're gonna find out if we you know this one thing I've learned brother been I've come to realize that we have not prepared our children for life we prepared them for the rapture we talking about the rapture have you prepared your child for the world to face the real world to face unreal devils out there that's the reason why our kids go under because we have not prepared them for the Odyssey of spirits we have not prepared our children for peer pressure we have not prepared our people children our young people in our church but they're gonna face some real devils out there we haven't prepared them we spoke about the rapture we spoke about the changing of the body but what about waiting as we wait for the rapture how I ought to live how am I supposed to walk how am I supposed to overcome brother bin when I face the world how do I overcome give me a quote no can take him say come let's pray let me intercede with you but I'm telling you our young children are being swallowed by the world they've been destroyed by the world I think somebody said I think brother Armand told me someone to go and taste the world to get a taste of money I can take off my shirt I can show you the scars from going to try and taste the world to have a testimony your testimony is that you can overcome in the face of all the forth that you are facing you can overcome it you can stand strong where the others are going under your standing I'm talking about loving daily as an overcomer praying with your children your wife bring your wife your wife is the only one that know you when you stand there in the pulpit my wife is the only one that knows me I'm living with my son and my two granddaughters in my home I'm living with him and I'm the pastor and I am the granddad they have to listen to me preaching and I need to make sure that they are not offended of me preaching something that I'm fighting with my wife I'm always at loggerheads with anybody I need to love and if you're a pastor's child your life is hell because your children by the bend when they grow up everybody's gonna look at them they're gonna judge you and your wife by the a Bahamian ministers behind this pulpit they are watching your family brother in the church yes in the church because in the church you have three kinds of believers we need to be honest we need to so loving this message it's not easy it's not easy living what Malachi 4 said how he ought to live that ye believe all could say my dad treated the believe the friends and if there's any enemies the same they didn't know who was his friends or his enemies Billy Paul related an incident with his dad passed through a border control anything to declare I don't have anything to declare and when brother Berengar at home as he was unpacking he saw pack of peanuts or nuts he says Billy I say to the gentleman I have nothing to declare and look at this he said propose it my dad drove back those miles to go and to declare that pack of the nuts and all that guy did when you got the nuts just rooting the dirt but are we there because that was the first fruits that was woven as an acceptance that is more like william branham in the field coming to maturity [Applause] Paul said be a follower of me as i am a follower of christ so I can also say I'm following william branham because he is the one that's going to stand heard them talk about behind the curtain of time or these or branham's know who they're your converts and an algorithm animals quit ask the question man with Paul's believers will Paul have to stand he said yeah Paul have to stand also the program says well I'm so glad I preached exactly what Paul preached and the host screamed we are resting on that and I'm resting on this message brother I tell you I I don't know where I would have been if it wasn't for this message I don't know where I would have been if it wasn't for this message if you haven't fallen in love with this message you know I'm going to tell you friend you ain't gonna stand there's many many that's walked away from this message I'm finishing up this many many that preach this message what caused them to walk away after years standing for this message and not walking away and listen they did they not only walking away they going into the world I saw a brother a picture was senior showed me a brother that was a pastor that had a website it had a massive church sitting in a short brother beam with a beer you see I've got no problem leaving the message if you haven't got the revelation but at least if Christ has done something in your life find yourself another church but no they don't they go into the world I saw a picture of that same brothers family here cut gothic black lipstick here wood streets in short-sleeve what has happened this message never became real it was all little all teaching beautiful teachings but it never became real it never became their life that's why I say this morning that this message must because this message is Christ this is Christ I'm supposed to become him I'm supposed to become this message I'm supposed to become Christ hallelujah that's the church that he's going to have she's gonna be glorious in her peril she's gonna be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that is the church brother that's going to be here in 1 1 3 some Georgia Street right George Street stock Valley no what that's the church that's gonna be a this is the church that they're going to fly from all over the world hungry hearts to come and see what's happening here where the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even written is being made manifest hallelujah I tell you this morning church men this is my life hallelujah oh my my my brother BAM talks in little quote God keeps his word this was preached the morning five hundred fifty seven oh four oh seven the morning remembers now ministering God keeps his word and he says I believe this coming a time is this Paul said where there was prophecies it shall fail where there is tongues they shall cease he says I believe it's coming a time when the Saints will get together like this listen to this quilty when the Saints will get together like this and just a love Spirit will just sweep over the audience and just every person in there oh that's wrong will be taken out and the dead presence under that love spirit all that's wrong will be taken out he said it will be such a presence of the Holy Ghost he says I believe why we are now to lay hands on them and pray for them now it's a contact maybe of a minister anointed and laying hands on just as a blessing to God but I believe it's a time coming when God's church oh oh my it's going to be so cold out like that where the Saints will sit together like this and the Holy Spirit will just come in just woo it just like it was on the day of Pentecost and just heal the people and raise up the people and great things he says I begin to see it happen 1957 if he has seen it then brother it must be evident here now but brother I don't see anything get into the room I don't feel the love spirit get into the realm get a bit higher out of the realm of see and taste and smell in here and feel get into the realm of the supernatural because God only moves in the supernatural hallelujah that's why God move you'll see all the negative things someone left our church after the child to the camp a brother let's be real
