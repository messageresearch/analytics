[27:50] their portion we thank you Lord in Jesus
[27:53] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[27:55] friends you may have your seats uh
[27:57] tonight so I want to talk about well I
[27:59] want to get into talking about prayer
[28:01] but you know as as we read here in
[28:03] habakook you know every vision is for an
[28:05] appointed time and but at the end it
[28:07] shall speak so so in order for a vision
[28:09] to speak it's got to put on flesh it's
[28:11] got to become reality it's got to be
[28:13] more than just words or even just the
[28:15] symbols it's got to become reality it's
[28:16] got to become flesh now we're living in
[28:19] a day where God is dwelling in his
[28:20] people once again we're the full power
[28:23] of Calvary is being expressed like never
[28:25] before I mean where the blood of Jesus
[28:27] Christ is so living in a people amen
[28:29] that we are that by his grace we we
[28:32] overcome the devil all of his Works
[28:34] we're not afraid of nothing that a
[28:35] spirit can do to us what could harm me
[28:37] of God is for you if God is for you who
[28:39] can be against you amen we're going to
[28:41] stand like they just realize God's for
[28:43] me I mean before I turned up upon the
[28:45] Earth he was for me and it was for me
[28:47] before I ever came here he made a way
[28:48] for me to go to heaven he's going to be
[28:49] for me for the rest of my life and for
[28:52] eternity amen but you see God you know
[28:54] it's amazing when you think about God
[28:56] where he thought in his mind the
[28:57] creation and the universe and you being
[28:59] here and you know he knew the world
[29:01] would be like it is like it is in you
[29:03] but but he wasn't
[29:04] he wasn't scared or in in any kind of
[29:07] dilemma or trouble when he saw that
[29:09] Satan would make the world like this
[29:11] he has full confidence in his salvation
[29:13] tonight amen he has full confidence in
[29:15] the power of his blood he does not ever
[29:18] get afraid or not a not a single thought
[29:21] of worry enters and into his mind can
[29:24] the enemy defeat me of course he can't
[29:26] defeat him how could you fight an enemy
[29:28] you think about the devil now he thinks
[29:29] he can outwit God and God knows in real
[29:32] time and even before it happens what
[29:34] he's going to do when he's going to do
[29:35] it and how he's going to do it you can't
[29:37] defeat an enemy that's got that kind of
[29:39] intelligence you know imagine you know a
[29:41] natural Army like the you know the
[29:43] ukrainians have been fed a lot of Intel
[29:44] from the Americans different things and
[29:46] the No Doubt the Russians get there and
[29:48] tell from other places but you know they
[29:50] kind of give a it's almost a
[29:52] guesstimation
[29:53] we think the enemy is going to do this
[29:55] and normally if they got the good enough
[29:56] intelligence they'll they'll be about
[29:57] right but sometimes they can be wrong
[30:00] but God's not like that he knows exactly
[30:02] when where what why how and he defeats
[30:05] the devil on every hand
[30:06] Hallelujah so the vision so when God saw
[30:09] a people remember Jesus Christ displayed
[30:11] everything that Adam lost he had
[30:13] dominion over nature he had dominion
[30:15] over every devil had dominion over
[30:17] everything yeah right I mean he
[30:19] conquered heldith in the grave he but he
[30:21] displayed everything that Adam lost in
[30:23] the garden the second Adam Jesus Christ
[30:25] manifested yes amen but now there's got
[30:28] to be a second Eve upon the earth a
[30:29] redeemed Church washing the blood of the
[30:32] Lamb amen Made In His Image so it was
[30:34] it's been sitting in the Bible
[30:36] prophesied through various types of
[30:38] Esther and Ruth and Rahab and different
[30:40] ones it's been you know it's been
[30:42] displayed through but now it's not a
[30:44] vision no more now it's speaking now
[30:47] it's become material where the word is
[30:49] not just think on paper no more but now
[30:51] it's living in human beings I mean it's
[30:53] not just a Theology of a discussion an
[30:55] argument it's gone well beyond that it's
[30:57] now this word by the Holy Ghost is put
[30:59] on flesh and you and I and it wasn't you
[31:01] wanting it it was God wanting it and
[31:03] what God wants he gets probably what God
[31:06] desires he has amen and nothing the
[31:08] devil can do can stop him from getting
[31:10] what he wanted to do amen all the
[31:12] nations and the promised land couldn't
[31:13] stop Joshua and Israel taking the
[31:15] inheritance nothing could stop a man and
[31:17] if God could not be stopped then he's
[31:19] not going to be stopped now I mean
[31:21] because he's the old powerful almighty
[31:22] God nothing could stop our lord Jesus
[31:25] fulfilling the prophecy is concerning
[31:27] his own life amen culture couldn't stop
[31:30] him unbelief couldn't stop him religion
[31:33] couldn't stop him arguments couldn't
[31:34] stop him fussing and fighting couldn't
[31:36] stop him Devils couldn't stop him Hal
[31:39] couldn't stop him the grave couldn't
[31:40] stop him the Romans couldn't stop him
[31:42] nothing could stop him from fulfilling
[31:44] the word that was prophesied for him to
[31:46] do and I say Friends by that same holy
[31:48] ghost that same quickening power will
[31:51] Quicken you to that same word that's
[31:53] prophesied of you Hallelujah so the
[31:55] vision is no longer a vision it's
[31:57] speaking
[31:58] Hallelujah amen you got to realize the
[32:01] Bible doesn't just reveal Jesus Christ
[32:03] it reveals you too if you're part of him
[32:06] I mean as as Paul would say in second
[32:08] Corinthians three ye are our Epistles
[32:11] written in our hearts known and read of
[32:13] all men for as much as ye are manifestly
[32:16] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[32:18] ministered by US Written not with ink
[32:20] but with it but with the spirit of the
[32:22] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[32:25] fleshly tables of the heart I mean so
[32:29] Paul saying the word that was inspired
[32:31] to him was preached to the Corinthians
[32:33] and the Holy Ghost gave them Faith to
[32:35] receive that word and then they
[32:37] manifested that word so you're saying
[32:39] that the you are the living Bible that's
[32:41] basically what I'm saying you are living
[32:42] Bibles Corinthians and I'll say you
[32:44] right here are living Bibles I mean the
[32:46] bride of Christ is a living Bible some
[32:48] people don't like it saying oh we're the
[32:50] Living Word well actually we are the
[32:51] Living Word why because by his grace he
[32:53] transforms us gets rid of sin nature
[32:56] cleans up our lives and we receive the
[32:58] baptism of Holy Ghost we come a totally
[32:59] different person and then what happens
[33:01] the word puts on flesh
[33:03] Hallelujah remember if you say you're a
[33:06] Christian you're christ-like the only
[33:08] way you can be christ-like is not by
[33:10] human effort amen that's why we have all
[33:12] the religion we have in this day
[33:15] and unfortunately it's sincere people
[33:17] but it doesn't produce what the Bible
[33:19] said it should produce because it's
[33:20] man's effort if you pray enough if you
[33:23] listen enough if you do this enough if
[33:25] you give yourself enough no it's not
[33:27] it's not your effort see salvation and
[33:30] overcoming power is not based on what
[33:32] you can do it's what God has done it's
[33:35] faith and what God has done will produce
[33:37] the results
[33:38] Hallelujah I believe that remember
[33:40] salvation when we get to heaven we're
[33:42] not going to be gathered around the
[33:43] throne saying yes Lord you're awesome
[33:45] and thank you for bringing me here but I
[33:47] did this
[33:48] no every testimony is what he did in
[33:51] your life that's a true testimony you
[33:53] try to inject yourself into it it's not
[33:55] a testimony of God you're just trying to
[33:57] say look at me how great I am
[33:59] he's the great one in our midst and
[34:01] he'll always be the great one in our
[34:02] midst and he always will be the great
[34:04] one in our midst amen he's the one that
[34:06] we come to worship we don't worship any
[34:08] man
[34:09] we don't worship any man-made
[34:10] achievement we worship what God's
[34:12] achievements Hallelujah
[34:15] amen so
[34:16] he said that you admit so so that the
[34:19] spirit of living God not written in
[34:20] tables of stone in the fleshy table of
[34:22] the heart for such trust have we through
[34:25] Christ to godward not that we are
[34:27] sufficient of ourselves or think or to
[34:30] think anything as of ourselves but our
[34:32] sufficiency is of God who also hath made
[34:35] us able Ministers of the New Testament
[34:37] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[34:39] this letter killeth but the spirit
[34:41] giveth life
[34:43] I mean swear not here to kill people
[34:45] with letter dead letter but the spirit
[34:47] of God gives life gives life to the word
[34:50] that the word speaks amen puts on flesh
[34:53] and you're glad we have this kind of
[34:54] religion
[34:56] amen and you're glad this works
[34:58] Hallelujah aren't you glad it works how
[35:01] does it work he makes it work holy how
[35:03] did he do it I don't know but he did it
[35:05] how did he find you I don't know but he
[35:07] found you how did he turn you around how
[35:08] did he turn me around I'd actually don't
[35:10] know but he did it
[35:11] amen I don't know where how he found me
[35:13] but he found me he turned me around he
[35:15] saved me I wasn't looking for him but he
[35:17] was looking for me and that's what
[35:18] matters amen so I believe if he hasn't
[35:20] found you he's looking for you she might
[35:22] as well put your hand up and say Lord
[35:23] here I am reveal yourself to me Lord may
[35:26] I know you and your word hallelujah amen
[35:30] now there is there is always a
[35:32] predestinated people that want to line
[35:34] up with the word of God
[35:36] and it's not by their ability that they
[35:38] line up remember this is not remember if
[35:40] you're beating yourself up about your
[35:42] Victory it's because you've got you in
[35:43] the equation
[35:45] you give yourself to the Lord and He
[35:47] will give you Victory right remember the
[35:49] devil always wants us to get our Focus
[35:51] off of him right if we get our Focus off
[35:53] of off the law then we're defeated so
[35:56] who's the first guy he he he gets you to
[35:58] look at the man in the mirror
[36:00] right and if your focus is on you and
[36:02] what you think you are and you're you
[36:05] know this is not something that we earn
[36:07] this is not a this is not a coffee card
[36:09] thing
[36:10] you know you get a free coffee when you
[36:13] buy the tenth one you know what no this
[36:14] is not how this works we don't earn
[36:16] God's anything he earned it for us on
[36:18] Calvary amen so he's giving us the free
[36:20] coffee
[36:22] but we don't know yeah that may sound
[36:23] ridiculous but you know but people think
[36:25] that they have to earn something to get
[36:27] something you know God I've done this
[36:28] therefore you've got to listen to me no
[36:30] his blood puts us on speaking terms with
[36:32] him amen that's what breaks down the
[36:34] middle wall partition between us and God
[36:36] is his blood it's not what we have done
[36:39] it's what he has done but you see the
[36:40] devil wants us to focus on ourselves and
[36:43] not him
[36:44] let's keep our eyes on the Lord
[36:46] amen but there is a there is a always a
[36:49] people
[36:50] that are ordained to line up with the
[36:52] word of God
[36:54] now that is not just the letter of the
[36:57] word because that kills
[36:58] it's the spirit of the word or it's the
[37:01] heart of God in the word see many people
[37:03] come to the message with preconceived
[37:06] ideas and they think that's how it
[37:08] should be so for example men who are
[37:10] very strict think well yeah I'm the head
[37:12] of the home I'm the boss and the Lord's
[37:14] over their family that's not how brother
[37:16] Baron operated
[37:18] you know making sure that kids are
[37:20] basically seen and not heard just pushed
[37:22] in a corner Ultra strict on them and
[37:24] brother Adam said you should spoil your
[37:25] kids a bit more it's better to do it
[37:27] that side than the other side
[37:28] can't you say Amen
[37:31] spoil me parents spoil me of it where's
[37:34] that chocolate
[37:35] I heard that in chess today
[37:37] but you see preconceived idea of of
[37:40] children should be seen and not heard
[37:42] and that comes in they people get this
[37:44] whooped on my mind because they they're
[37:46] lining up with a letter of the word and
[37:48] not the spirit of the word
[37:50] amen men come along and they say yep I'm
[37:53] the head of the home they beat down
[37:54] their wife
[37:55] you know push you down that's not the
[37:58] spirit of the word
[37:59] that's culture coming in
[38:01] we're not here to bring our culture into
[38:03] Christianity remember this is not a
[38:05] white man's gospel any color gospel this
[38:07] is gospels from heaven right the gospel
[38:10] transcends culture right sure we're all
[38:13] built a bit differently but we should
[38:14] never bring our culture and how we were
[38:16] raised into how the word says we should
[38:18] have our families because 99 of how we
[38:21] were raised was actually we need to get
[38:22] rid of it
[38:23] and we say Lord change my thinking of my
[38:26] heart and my mode but everything how I
[38:27] operate everyday life change it to match
[38:29] your word Lord not I'm not here to bring
[38:32] preconceived ideas and say yeah this is
[38:33] how it should be they see people have
[38:35] lined up with the letter of the word
[38:37] bringing in their culture and things but
[38:40] now people have come to bring actually
[38:41] line up with the spirit of the word
[38:44] which gives life
[38:46] Hallelujah are you glad you can go back
[38:48] a generation and see it was like that
[38:50] they're Believers I'm not saying they
[38:51] weren't Believers don't get me wrong
[38:52] there's the people who begin to line up
[38:54] with the spirit of the word more than
[38:56] just a letter killing
[38:59] but you see now there's power when that
[39:01] begins to happen
[39:02] because the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[39:04] begin to get greater remember the
[39:07] enemy's moving on every hand but God is
[39:09] greater than the enemy right the
[39:11] remember when the enemy comes in like a
[39:13] flood the Lord says I'll raise up a
[39:14] standard against them and that standard
[39:16] is the anointed word in a people
[39:18] it means you look at this now she's he's
[39:21] about watch when the spiritual bride
[39:23] when she begins to have a Revival when
[39:25] she begins to come back and line herself
[39:27] up with the word of God watch then watch
[39:29] again you see how that the scriptures at
[39:31] that time there'll be a message sweep
[39:33] out to catch that bride catch that woman
[39:35] elect but I'm saying we're not just
[39:37] lining up the word that kills but the
[39:39] spirit of the word amen so people are
[39:41] going to line up with the heart of the
[39:42] word
[39:43] then God sweeps in to catch that licked
[39:46] woman away and we're living in that
[39:48] season it was a vision now it's here now
[39:51] it's speaking amen amen where it's not
[39:53] just the mechanics of of of church order
[39:56] and knowing Doctrine Doctrine but it's
[39:57] to make it's the Dynamics of the Holy
[39:59] Ghost coming in and making that word
[40:01] live amen I'm so glad this has gone
[40:04] beyond argument and compiling scriptures
[40:06] and quotes and having a stand that says
[40:08] no God comes in amen and takes over the
[40:11] church amen where it's not a man ruling
[40:13] over a bunch of people it's God
[40:14] shepherding a flock
[40:16] [Music]
[40:17] Hallelujah
[40:19] you know when you think about it that
[40:20] you know Jesus reputation was never made
[40:24] with the stiffened starchy
[40:26] his reputation was made with the Sinners
[40:28] so those he could who who actually
[40:31] crying out to be ministered to was where
[40:34] he got his reputation so so the woman at
[40:37] the well had five husbands and she was
[40:39] living with the six she was crying out
[40:41] she needed she was a broken woman yeah
[40:44] and she was looking for help and she
[40:46] knew that you know her father Jacob dug
[40:48] this well and so she had a religious
[40:50] kind of background but nothing could
[40:51] help her but Messiah said I need to go
[40:54] by the way of Samaria because I've got
[40:55] one of my daughters is there and she's
[40:58] hurting and she's broken but I don't
[40:59] want to leave her in that condition
[41:00] because that's not how I saw her before
[41:02] the foundation of the world and then so
[41:04] he made his reputation by revealing to
[41:06] her the things that she had gone through
[41:08] and her state but she but he did that
[41:10] that her eyes would come open and say
[41:13] the Messiah were looking for us here on
[41:15] the Earth right now Hallelujah the woman
[41:17] with the alabaster box amen the Lord's
[41:20] reputation was made amen she wasn't
[41:23] invited to Simon's Feast but she made
[41:25] her way in any way she broke that
[41:27] Alabaster Box At His Feet did not care
[41:29] what anyone else was doing around her
[41:31] amen and and he said thy sins by many
[41:34] are forgiven go in peace amen the lepers
[41:38] couldn't be helped by no one but they
[41:39] came to Jesus
[41:41] I mean he healed me I mean you know this
[41:43] Lazarus was dead in the grave four days
[41:46] his reputation was made being the
[41:48] resurrection of Life see it wasn't just
[41:49] talked about he manifested what he said
[41:52] he was and I pray to God that whoever
[41:55] comes through these doors
[41:57] amen as Christians our the reputation of
[42:00] the Lord Jesus Christ will be manifested
[42:03] that he heals the sick
[42:05] he heals the broken amen he comes
[42:07] troubled Minds amen he brings peace amen
[42:11] he brings understanding he brings
[42:13] identity and then he brings he he brings
[42:16] a belonging Amen to the word your people
[42:18] in the word I pray people can say this
[42:20] is what we are known for
[42:22] I came in these doors one way I left
[42:24] another way amen I came in Lost and
[42:26] looking and hungry and not satisfied by
[42:29] our left full and rejoicing and
[42:31] reinvigorated my life came alive
[42:34] Hallelujah he's real amen I trust that
[42:36] that could be our reputation amen when
[42:39] people come into your house and you
[42:41] begin to talk about the goodness of God
[42:42] the atmosphere begins to change
[42:45] it doesn't matter what they're in or
[42:47] what they've been doing I mean the
[42:48] atmosphere comes down and they know what
[42:51] these people are talking about it's not
[42:53] a theory it's not a learning it's real I
[42:57] mean because Jesus Christ is alive amen
[42:59] he's not just alive in these four walls
[43:01] he should be more alive out there than
[43:04] just in here I mean we come in here to
[43:06] get our our batteries boosted amen but
[43:09] it's out there where God can Minister
[43:10] Amen to to anyone
[43:13] hey Hallelujah that's the kind of Jesus
[43:16] I believe in
[43:17] amen amen
[43:20] we had we oh I don't care if this we had
[43:22] we had brother I'll call him brother
[43:24] Keith Thomas
[43:25] he was a he was a pastor he became an
[43:28] atheist in about 2002 where he thinks
[43:31] he's an atheist up to hear an evolution
[43:34] and he basically you know God moved on
[43:37] his heart came out of Catholicism he had
[43:39] a moment there and he was a he you know
[43:41] he told us of his walk with God such as
[43:42] simplicity
[43:44] something moved on his heart when he's
[43:45] just in his early 20s I've got to know
[43:48] God
[43:49] and he went to and he poured himself
[43:51] into Catholicism for a year because
[43:52] that's how his race didn't help him went
[43:54] to Evangelical Church Pentecostal church
[43:56] and God was doing things came across the
[43:58] message got baptized and but then you
[44:01] know he just got caught up in well he
[44:03] got made a pastor of a church
[44:05] and he said he never stopped
[44:07] to for God to satisfy that longing that
[44:10] he knew he had the Holy Ghost
[44:12] because he was pulling and confusion and
[44:14] especially in those days all kind of
[44:15] stuff politics and trouble and fussing
[44:17] and fighting and he's caught up and all
[44:19] that and we're saying to him because
[44:22] he's on Murphy Street there was where
[44:23] the boarding house was Mountain go back
[44:25] to that moment yes go back to that
[44:28] condition
[44:29] where it's not all confusing and you
[44:31] know what happens the Devil comes in and
[44:33] clouds your life well this is happening
[44:35] in the home the financial trouble this
[44:38] person is saying this about this person
[44:39] and now this problem with my children it
[44:42] all kind of you know becomes all
[44:43] confusing and busy and it's just like
[44:44] walking in a in the clouds fog who's had
[44:48] that kind of experience but God doesn't
[44:49] operate that way
[44:51] God has a still small voice and it's
[44:54] clear and he's alive and we're telling
[44:57] him just go back to that kind of
[44:59] condition and God will answer your
[45:00] longing and there's such an embass fear
[45:03] at the table and I knew he felt it and
[45:07] when he left he said you're doing a good
[45:08] thing
[45:10] I pray I pray it goes back to those
[45:12] moments because to me he didn't walk
[45:15] away from God he walked away from
[45:16] people's fussing and fighting and
[45:18] religious problems
[45:19] so I believe he's coming home that's
[45:21] what I said I call him brother Keith so
[45:23] remember him in prayer
[45:25] Hallelujah that's what our God does
[45:29] Hallelujah now
[45:32] oh okay A bit of wind this up quickly
[45:35] now a vision has to be spoken and that
[45:38] becomes material
[45:40] right the Apostle Paul says he says here
[45:43] he says we're just going to go down to
[45:44] verse 28 wherefore we're receiving a
[45:46] kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[45:49] have Grace whereby we may serve god
[45:51] acceptedly with reverence and godly fear
[45:53] for our God is a consuming fire now that
[45:57] word receiving it has a few meanings but
[46:00] it means something that's transmitted
[46:02] something that's been sent Hallelujah so
[46:05] the kingdom of God we know is the Holy
[46:07] Ghost within us because Jesus said the
[46:09] kingdom doesn't come with observation
[46:11] but the kingdom of God is within you
[46:12] speaking of the Holy Ghost that would
[46:14] come so now the Holy Ghost the kingdom
[46:17] of God we receive is something that's
[46:19] been transmitted down into our souls
[46:21] that God would take the word anointed
[46:23] with the Holy Ghost transmitted into
[46:25] your life and it would become flesh
[46:28] aren't you glad you got a receiving
[46:29] station
[46:30] Hallelujah and you guys you you got
[46:32] something in you that can receive the
[46:34] word of God
[46:35] Hallelujah and this is Sean where Peter
[46:37] was preaching in cornelius's house
[46:39] Cornelius was a devout man but he only
[46:41] knew the religion of the Jews he didn't
[46:43] he didn't even know the Messiah had come
[46:45] and been crucified and resurrected and
[46:47] the Holy Ghost poured out but an angel
[46:48] appeared to him when he was praying he
[46:50] said Cornelius your arms and prayers are
[46:51] come up before God now the angel didn't
[46:54] tell him how to receive the holy ghost
[46:55] or give him the Holy Ghost said go get
[46:56] Peter part of the body to come and
[46:58] preach and then then Peter comes in
[47:00] preaches about the crucifixion the
[47:02] resurrection and everything says well
[47:04] yet Peter spake these words the Holy
[47:06] Ghost fell on all of them that heard the
[47:08] word so what's happening the kingdom of
[47:09] God was transmitted amen through the
[47:12] body to them and they received the Holy
[47:16] Ghost and they are the circumcision
[47:17] which believer astonished why because
[47:19] they're back in the upper room again but
[47:21] it wasn't with the Jews it was with the
[47:22] Gentiles and they were astonished saying
[47:25] that same one who came down and filled
[47:27] us then is the same God who's come right
[47:29] here and filled these people hallelujah
[47:32] I'm so glad I can say I was there when
[47:34] the spirit came Hallelujah and I'm not
[47:36] talking about historical day of
[47:38] Pentecost Acts chapter two I'm talking
[47:39] about right here Amen in Our Lives who
[47:42] have seen the Spirit come again and
[47:44] again and again and he's filled people
[47:46] again and again and again
[47:49] Hallelujah I think we should brag on the
[47:51] Lord don't you think so I mean we should
[47:53] tell them as wonderful works that this
[47:56] word is alive it's not dead amen
[47:58] whatever you're going through our God is
[48:00] greater amen he's more than able to Lead
[48:02] You Through It Whatever trouble you're
[48:04] facing amen Our God has already led many
[48:06] people through the thing you're going
[48:07] through right now and he brought them
[48:09] out he'll bring you out the other side
[48:12] Hallelujah can any man Peter saying and
[48:15] they heard them speak with tongues of
[48:16] magnified God then answer Peter can any
[48:18] man forbid water that these should have
[48:21] should not be baptized seeing they have
[48:22] received the Holy Ghost as well as we
[48:24] and he commanded to be baptized in the
[48:26] name of the Lord then prayed they him to
[48:28] tarry certain days Hallelujah all right
[48:31] all right amen God's very good at
[48:33] repeating himself
[48:34] amen he fills every believing child with
[48:37] his holy spirit I believe you fully
[48:39] repented given your whole life I mean
[48:41] you baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ
[48:42] remission a sin and you shall receive
[48:44] the gift of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[48:46] now
[48:47] prayer okay because we're going to have
[48:49] prayer but you know many times we forget
[48:52] prayer is always tied in with praise and
[48:56] Thanksgiving
[48:57] you know how the devil tries to disable
[48:59] the body of Christ as make us tense make
[49:02] us stressed make us burdened in the
[49:04] wrong kind of way because remember if
[49:05] God gives a burden he'll manifest that
[49:07] burden right but devil just gives a
[49:09] burden there's no answer to there's no
[49:11] way out and it's all questions and
[49:13] trouble and there's no answer and he you
[49:15] know we can't we can't really we can't
[49:17] walk with God like that but he wants us
[49:19] but the devil wants us to be in that
[49:21] state but it's good if you're in that
[49:23] state you realize that's not actually
[49:24] you
[49:25] that's not actually how you're meant to
[49:27] be he said devil you can carry your own
[49:29] bags I'm not carrying around your
[49:31] tenseness and your anxiety and your
[49:33] burdens and your stress and your high
[49:35] blood pressure and your problems you
[49:37] carry your own bags devil hey man you
[49:39] made it you have it back
[49:41] Hallelujah but you see when we get into
[49:44] a spirit of Praise when we pray
[49:46] then the spirit of God can take over
[49:49] and pray what he once prayed
[49:52] see it's not us really we shouldn't be
[49:54] us trying to work out what to pray sure
[49:56] we have our list who's got a list who
[49:58] has some needs it's good to have those
[50:00] on your heart but it's not now I'm going
[50:02] to write out a prayer and say it this is
[50:04] going to that's not how we should pray
[50:06] we should yield ourselves to the Holy
[50:08] Ghost and say Lord what do you want to
[50:11] pray
[50:12] you know you could have a prayer meeting
[50:13] every day of your life you say but
[50:15] there's only me invite God to your
[50:16] prayer meeting amen that's the best one
[50:18] to have in your premium you and him can
[50:20] pray together
[50:21] Hallelujah
[50:23] amen so
[50:25] he says this here now says rejoice in
[50:28] the Lord alway and again I say rejoice
[50:29] let your moderation be known to unto all
[50:32] men the Lord is at hand be careful for
[50:34] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[50:36] supplication with Thanksgiving how many
[50:39] times do we forget the Thanksgiving
[50:40] birth you know shall we pray we make
[50:43] supplication we make requests and God
[50:44] I'm so glad his phone lines never
[50:46] overloaded the signals never jammed I
[50:49] remember when Christy and I were there
[50:51] in Christchurch in the first earthquake
[50:53] and you know when the place was shaking
[50:56] and we were praying and God came down we
[50:58] had a wonderful time in prayer Christie
[51:00] was off praising the Lord and tongues
[51:02] and having a Rejoice today but the
[51:03] spirit of God was so there I wanted to
[51:05] open my eyes and watch what's going on
[51:06] but I thought no I'm going to pray
[51:08] and God just came down we had a glorious
[51:10] time but then you tried after all that
[51:12] was said and done we try and get on the
[51:14] um cell phone because you know
[51:15] Christine's Grandparents were in
[51:16] Christchurch and and it was just the
[51:19] second the network is overloaded
[51:21] God's Network don't get overloaded
[51:23] uh we can all be talking to him at once
[51:25] and he can talk to us individually all
[51:27] at once at the same time so I'm so
[51:29] thankful his signal don't get overloaded
[51:31] but how many times do we forget the
[51:32] Thanksgiving
[51:34] amen because it says in the Book of
[51:36] Psalms
[51:37] let's go to verse 34. I don't have this
[51:39] on my um
[51:40] I don't have this on on there
[51:44] um just came to mind
[51:46] but um you know it says it says a
[51:48] condition
[51:49] that when you should praise the Lord
[51:52] okay you can actually throw it up can
[51:53] you put up Psalms 34
[51:56] and uh verse one
[51:59] okay so here's the condition because you
[52:01] say when should I bless the Lord
[52:03] and David or whoever wrote the said at
[52:04] all times
[52:06] his his praise shall continue to be in
[52:08] my mouth
[52:09] so at all times not just the good times
[52:12] not just the camp times not just the
[52:15] Happy Times the bad times the sad times
[52:17] the troubled times the burden times the
[52:20] times when things aren't going the way
[52:22] you think they should be going you
[52:23] should bless the Spain at all times at
[52:26] all times that covers the 24 said
[52:28] whatever condition you're in bless the
[52:30] Lord
[52:30] they say Lord my life is falling apart I
[52:33] bless your name amen Lord I'm in great
[52:35] trouble I bless your name Lord I don't
[52:37] know the answer this problem I bless
[52:38] your name that's how we should be at all
[52:41] times amen hallelujah we should always
[52:44] enter into prayer like this bless this
[52:46] night that's why when the lord gave the
[52:48] model prayer you know our father child
[52:50] in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[52:52] thy kingdom come thy will be done and
[52:54] then it wasn't to finish with with the
[52:56] for thine is the power and Glory forever
[52:57] and ever amen so the prayer starts with
[53:00] praise and to me it ends with praise and
[53:02] that's how we should pray we should
[53:04] enter into praise then you feel saying
[53:06] come on your heart then you pray for it
[53:07] then maybe you start praising him again
[53:09] something else comes on your mind pray
[53:11] for that you should just do it like that
[53:13] who's who's with me it's good it'll make
[53:16] you happy
[53:17] Hallelujah you think about where the
[53:19] Lord brought you from I mean let's just
[53:20] let's just be real folks where did he
[53:22] find you
[53:23] where did he find your winners he
[53:25] brought you
[53:26] Hallelujah
[53:27] yeah that's right and and it just gets
[53:30] better
[53:30] Hallelujah because we have this all of
[53:33] us in Heaven Too amen so there's just a
[53:35] foretaste of Heaven amen God comes down
[53:37] it's just a four taste it's just the
[53:39] fourth Taste of heaven love divine but
[53:42] then eventually we're not just living in
[53:43] the trickle of it we're living in the
[53:45] fountain when our bodies are changing
[53:47] we're up in glory so really we can't
[53:49] lose it's all good the world's falling
[53:51] apart it's all good I'm in great trouble
[53:54] it's all good Hallelujah
[53:57] you might think I'm crazy but I actually
[53:59] I did get brainwashed
[54:01] because my brain needed a washing it was
[54:03] filthy it thought about all kinds of
[54:04] filthy things but it got washed
[54:07] okay so yeah I've been brainwashed I'll
[54:09] just confess it to the world that's good
[54:12] holy amen that's a whiter snow praise
[54:15] the Lord so we should always have
[54:16] Thanksgiving amen we should bless the
[54:18] Lord at all times amen
[54:20] Hallelujah now you look at this I
[54:22] thought this is very interesting this is
[54:24] Psalms 22. and Psalms 22 is really when
[54:28] David
[54:29] is is looking at Calvary
[54:31] in
[54:33] in vision
[54:34] I don't have the whole thing here but
[54:36] just just look at this now he says my
[54:38] God my God why is thou forsaken me why
[54:40] thou so far from helping me and from the
[54:43] words of my roaring he was he was caught
[54:45] up in the spirit and he was looking at
[54:47] Christ on on the cross
[54:50] so I know what kind of stadiums and when
[54:51] the inspiration struck him but he was
[54:53] literally there in my opinion
[54:55] but then he says oh my God I cry in the
[54:58] daytime and thou Harris me not in the
[55:01] ninth season and am not silent but Thou
[55:04] Art holy oh that inhabitants the Praises
[55:08] of Israel amen so David had a revelation
[55:10] no he's looking at Calvary the great
[55:12] Agony our Lord would suffer there
[55:14] he had a revelation that God inhabits
[55:17] the Praises of his people
[55:19] that means if you want God to come down
[55:21] start praising him from her thanks
[55:22] thankful heart and God will step down
[55:25] into that praise he'll inhabit that
[55:27] praise it's not no no we know praise and
[55:30] worship is not rejoicing in a in a skill
[55:34] right praise and worship is from a
[55:36] thankful heart that what God has done
[55:39] amen so he inhabits the praise so if you
[55:41] want God to come down and anoint your
[55:42] prayer start praising him start giving
[55:45] him thanks for what he's done and what
[55:48] he said he would do
[55:49] Hallelujah
[55:51] amen
[55:53] amen I like the Psalms it's good praise
[55:56] ye the Lord
[55:57] Praise Him in a sanctuary
[55:59] Praise Him in the ferment of his power
[56:01] now that permanent word is the same as
[56:03] in Genesis was atmosphere so Praise Him
[56:05] in the atmosphere of his power and when
[56:07] you feel the power of God search through
[56:09] Praise Him hallelujah praise him for his
[56:12] mighty acts Praise Him according to his
[56:14] excellent greatness praise him with the
[56:16] sound of the trumpet praise him with the
[56:17] pulsory in the harp praise him with the
[56:19] timber in the dance Hallelujah
[56:22] wherefore dancing because it's in the
[56:23] word hallelujah amen amen if it's Holy
[56:26] Ghost dancing it's good dancing I mean
[56:28] praise him with string instruments and
[56:29] organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols
[56:31] Praise Him upon the high sounding
[56:32] symbols let everything that has breath
[56:34] who's got breath today
[56:37] praising the Lord
[56:39] Hallelujah I heard I think his brother
[56:41] Ron Spencer said the only excuse for you
[56:43] not to praise the Lord is if you're dead
[56:45] because let everything have breath
[56:46] praise you the Lord amen so if you've
[56:48] got breath praise him
[56:50] amen
[56:52] this is what we should do
[56:53] the lord loves praise he loves worship
[56:57] in spite of condition
[56:59] Hallelujah
[57:01] amen now when you get into that
[57:03] atmosphere and it can just be like that
[57:05] it's not a 10 minute workout this is not
[57:08] a warm-up like you're going to run a
[57:10] track and field or play a game
[57:12] you just from a thankful heart say Lord
[57:14] You're beautiful your face is all I seek
[57:17] when your eyes are upon this child Your
[57:19] Grace abounds in me his eyes are always
[57:21] upon you

[57:25] Ghost can come in and take over
[57:28] likewise the spirit all also help with
[57:30] our infirmities for he for we know not
[57:33] what we should pray for as we ought but
[57:35] the spirit itself maketh intercession
[57:38] for us with groanings that cannot be
[57:40] uttered who's ever prayed such a way
[57:43] just
[57:44] you don't even know what you're saying

[57:48] through you you say what did he pray for
[57:50] I don't know but he answered it
[57:52] amen for for us with groanings that
[57:54] cannot be uttered and he that searcheth
[57:56] the heart knoweth what is the mind of
[57:58] the spirit because he maketh
[58:00] intercession for the Saints according to
[58:02] the will of God
[58:04] amen see we're all intercessors
[58:06] not like our Lord Jesus Christ not for
[58:08] sin but for intercede for one another
[58:10] right but the devil doesn't want us to
[58:12] to to possess this office
[58:14] Amen to praise God then God can come

[58:19] to
[58:22] the devil can't stop you right he may
[58:26] hinder you but he can't stop you amen
