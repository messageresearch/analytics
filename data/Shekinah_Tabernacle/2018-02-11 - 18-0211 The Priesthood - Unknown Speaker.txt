TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I enjoy coming to church I enjoy conventions I enjoy meetings special meetings and that but there's something about your own fellowship that where the Lord's called you the Lord's place you and you can just go there and be faithful we can week at weekend we cap and be in our place sometimes they're going is good sometimes the goings rough whatever it is we're there we press on and yeah this is the this is the first service after our camp who had a good camp a good good camp meetings in well I guess none of the people here was anyone here young enough to go to the camp and this in here yeah I think it was 35 was the cutoff you know I think I'm 35 or thei I think I'm 35 maybe 36 but I'm pretty sure it's 35 I might yeah okay so yeah I could have made it to the Kemp if I wasn't married and had children because I think there were some 35 year olds at the camp that were that were there as campers man makes me feel old I think having children and that sort of thing you the responsibilities of life are slightly different when you've got children and that sort of thing in it your approach to life is different you kind of not really young anymore you find it I refuse to get old brother in you're not old are you no men they're a and here as young as anything little boy you know free and the Spirit of God our spirits don't get old men the body does its thing and deceives everyone but the Spirit is yang full of life that's what I love about Christians he just doesn't matter how old they get they're full of life because their spirit is alive you know there's nothing worse than seeing an unbeliever and just watching their spirit become decrepit and start to die because it's an unfortunate thing but their spirit will one day die like and it's kind of like it goes through this process they get they complain they're when as they say they're all they it's all negative it's the spirits going down I'm so glad that we can stay alive and be fresh the old people as young as the young people that's the way that it is so let's we're probably going to get interrupted halfway through by the I think the troops are on some secret mission outside but let's um let's stand this morning and welcome at the service to the Lord and just be under expectation for the Lord's going to do for us this morning Heavenly Father we thank you that we can be here in your presence and this place that we have set aside to worship You Lord and we've we come with an expectation upon our hearts Lord to receive a touch from you to receive a word from you Lord that you deal with us in a special way and speak to our hearts Lord where each one individuals here we're all different we we all think different we act different Lord and yet you're such a great God that you know each one individually and and you know how to speak to each one of us and the way that we would here and in the way that is right for us Lord so we thank you Lord that that you will speak to each one here this morning Lord that each what each person here would go leave this place better than what we were when we came and when it doesn't matter which way you would choose to do that Lord we believe that your desire and your purpose for our life is good Lord and it's wholesome you're a great father to Lord that you love us you care for us and you desire for our growth Lord so each individual here is going to grow more in you their character will be molded more their eyes will be more fixed upon you Lord our weight will be more steadfast our walk will be more steadfast will grow in grace and in faith this morning so Lord we just thank you that you're the Almighty God that can't that that does provide all of those things

done count your blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you what the Lord has done amen praise the Lord on that though let's maybe count our blessings you can take a seat who's got a testimony this morning I was going to do one more song but maybe someones got a testimony from camp or something like that big like this year brother Adam and come up here but man so we can hear you in the microphone good morning Saints has been a wonderful camp but sometimes when when God deals with you it's not always fun you know it's like here you ask ask the question Lord what am I missing and you've not dealt with me for a while you know and I was in this Jubilee and all those things and and I stood still I said Lord I'm missing something no I'm not being dealt with you know and I want to learn more about you and get closer to you but I can't do it if you don't help me and of course they knee he doubted was me and I was pride here oh man I was proud you know I couldn't take what he was saying to me and it came out of the word and it was perfect but my thought was different and instead of just entertaining the thought I did what brother Branham said always to do and I went back to the word and I kept asking the Lord I said Lord I'm missing something you know this is hurting it's not I don't agree with it but I agree with it and I don't want to go into details because I don't think it's it's time for that but I want to say is I was confused and it was about the Word of God and Word of God is never confusing it does not confuse you it is perfect and I kept looking and I kept looking and I and I just kept looking I said lord I don't understand when I went to camp brother then he preached about when he went to preach and he was empty as empty as he could be he says but the man told him after the service there was a man behind you holding you up that whole service and that was me before camp and because when camp happened you go into camp mode you just start working and and you do what you need to do and you lay aside all these things because now you it's for the children it's not for us but they were still that emptiness inside and when he preached that God say but now I can deal with it because I carried you through this whole thing and all that brother Danny was preaching about was about pretty much what I was going through and so the praise the Lord even in when we were serving I was being served and that's how God is but he's never confusing these words never confusing it is 100 percent just sometimes you need to lay in the presence of God and keep baking and keep baking until that shell breaks and you can get through its the hardest thing to do but trust me God gets the glory every time I pray so if it could help anyone who all goes through hard times just keep laying in his prisons and go back to his word every time and it will be alright I know so to God be the glory amen anyone else right brother George Ellis here maybe come up here then we can hear you I didn't mean to put you on the spot I wasn't going to I just looked at you and I saw your face beaming enough of I mean I wasn't planning to give a testimony but Sunday evening was very very powerful very powerful I was I was blown away completely I was crushed completely I was I think that's the evangelizing spirit that ministry you know it sometimes is like fire and brimstone but it's you know it's a shaking it's a wake-up call you know and I felt like I felt like a soldier who was had neglected his duties you know and and the Lord comes in you know the training soldiers get is you know sometimes Special Forces come in and take your weapon it you have to tell you up you're not you're not up you're not you know logically you're not alert yes and it's part of the training I mean God loves us even and even if he does that and that's what they do in the army you know they don't kick you away they just train you they just come and beat you they'll say you know where's your weapon here it is I've got it you know taking it away you know and it is part of the training and it is and it's you know although as much as I don't want to give this kind of testimony it is true and I felt like a soldier that had neglected his duty and uh and man sunday sunday was you know was pretty rough was pretty rough for me but it is a testimony from god but even the way I felt was quite rough and but Tuesday man Tuesday came in and that was that was you know I told brother Andy that was custom made yeah you get a suit and man and you know the Lord measures in and that suit is for you and I think the Lord was so and it was such an encouraging moment and you know although army life is not our entire life you know we're in balanced society we're not you know supposed not like Spartans you know living like a military life you know God has you know has has laid out everything for us you know we you know we're supposed to farm we're supposed to herd we're supposed to do many things but we are soldiers of God as well yeah and we have we need to be trained and I pray I pray to God that He will give us the training you know be like true soldiers of gods [Applause] it's not really a testimony it's just um glorifying God I didn't want to go to the camp I was looking forward to it and lots of things had happened and I'd built up walls and complexes around my heart from hurts and instead of taking good intentions are always to bad intentions because I'd been feeding the black dog I hadn't had much time for praying with the Lord so in something comes along and starts attacking you you can't just laid aside to the Lord and just keep walking on and so yes I was not looking forward to camp but on Sunday night the Lord took everything it's broke down all the walls he broke down all the complexes and it is completely full making such joy and love that I've been missing in my life I've missed that love and I just want to thank him so much that he was so thoughtful - even though I didn't want to go he still knew he was gonna meet me there and just completely change me again and I'm thankful to him for that so praise God for it praise the Lord brother George maybe that was prophetic what we've been calling you the last couple of weeks so rather jaws is Greek you know and then you know the Spartans are kind of Greek so yeah and they're these naturally speaking supposedly they're they're like warriors you know that you know one man can kill a hundred sort of type of guys you know so we could have we've been joking around and calling brother jords of sparta hey it's true your brother you're a spiritual Spartan I mean any late son I had an item this morning she loved do it you know the song but I just want to sing it I sing it last night and I just enjoyed it I'm gonna sing it fee this isn't one of my song but it's just it's a rendition of a song you would already know and a few songs put together but it's a very nice song and I

and if there's anything people will need to bring Christine we'll be in touch and also just an update on us having our own camp at Forest Lake so I have booked I've booked the camp for Friday the 13th to Sunday the 15th of April but then they will confirm that they said tomorrow and then also I haven't seen a date for our AGM yet but we're going to have it on March and if you have any anything you'd like to bring up can you please either send me a message or put it in the offering box so I can see it an agenda for what we'd like to discuss so whatever you feel like to bring up please please let me know I mean no it's um to to the scripture well actually 1:1 testimony just as you're as you're turning to Exodus 24 I just got this message from brother Jeremy dear away and um they're away in Auckland but so brother Jeremy he came up for Priya a couple of months ago for one of one of us customers at Moss chef Sarah who had she was going through cancer treatment and that was a couple of months ago and then so she so this is her words I mean sorry his words rather he just sent me no whatsoever he said she came back and said she has no terminal cancer in her body I believe with all my heart that God answered that prayer he is good I mean she's going through going through treatment but now it's gone hallelujah and I trust you all had ably said well let's just read the scripture then we'll saw am i driving this here we go Exodus 24 verses 12 to 15 we're gonna have a bit of a sorry bit of a that were chopped up reading but here we are says and the Lord said unto Moses come up to me into the mount and be there and I'll give the tables of stone and a law and commandments which I've written and thou that thou mayst teach them and Moses rose up at his minister Joshua and Moses went up to the into the Mount of God and he said unto the elders tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you and behold Aaron and Hur are with you If any man have any matters to do let him come unto them and Moses went up into the mount and the cloud covered the mount and then we keep reading it says in the glory of the Lord a boat upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered at six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses there the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the Mount and the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and get him up into the mount and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights and then we're going to go to Exodus chapter 28 and we're going to read a couple of scriptures from here and then we're gonna go to Psalms 110 just as a bit of a context he sees here now this is excess twenty-eight one two three it says and take them unto these as God speaking to to Moses and take down unto the Aaron thy brother and his sons with them from among the children of Israel and that they may minister unto me in the priest's office even Aaron never a bill Eliezer a thema Aaron sons and thou shalt make holy garments for aaron and thou shalt make holy garments for aaron my brother for glory and for beauty and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted whom i have filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office now going to read one more scripture in Psalms 110 and verses one two three and this all this will all come together as we as we go along the service sums 110 verses 1 2 3 it sees this is just a bit of a context a psalm of David the Lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until I make money in amis thy footstool the Lord shall send a rod of thy strength out of Zion rule thou in the midst of that enemies thy people this is you thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power this is a day of God's power and the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the Jui of thy youth amen let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we have read your word Lord we thank you Father you are here with us Lord we just want to pray remember all as well those who are not here this morning may be their portion father if they are watching in by the way of streaming Lord may this atmosphere that's here may be in their homes Lord father may be more than just looking at a screen but father may it be like they're here with us and father if they are unwell and body may you touch them you are the Lord God that heals all our diseases and we thank you that by your stripes we are healed it's already a finished work we thank you for that father so may you touch them embody father that unwell and Lord may you meet every need here father as well and we just want to commit the service into your hands Lord may have preeminence and may you get glory to yourself Lord Father and Jesus Christ name father anoint each one now we ask in your word Lord especially in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may have your seats I just want to mention just quickly about camp so they night was a tremendous every service brother Danny was ministering was a tremendous service Sunday night was like the Pool of Bethesda was open and where God moved and I'm glad you know I would encourage you you can't get that kind of atmosphere watching a recording sometimes you see a recording you think was it really that great but you got to remember being back there it was really that great and so I encourage you friends if we ever have surfaces like that again you don't want to don't rub yourself and be there I mean it was tremendous never seen but then even said this this doesn't always happen like this it at youth camps I was I picked them up from the airport we're driving home and he's ministered at brother Tim Pruitt's youth camp at Louisiana they have it every every Easter time and you should if you go watch those services this there's like six hundred odd youth of their parents are there they have pre Alliance God comes down you see you see even in the video a wave of the Spirit come down upon the people and demons are cast out people are delivered people are filled with the Holy Ghost and I said to him I want meetings like that and that's why we originally had the youth camp with the adults being there as well he said it makes a big difference you know people people they're pulling God speak to them speak to me move move down every pew so I want to say thank you to each and every one I mean for being there you bringing your look of fire it makes a difference makes a big difference amen it was wonderful so I encourage your friends if we have services like that you want to be there because God was there he met Mike he he blew out he totally went beyond my expectation amen and so I was very thankful he had moved like that and it wasn't like it trying to pull people it was just like one big one mind everyone just stood up went forward God came down I saw people I see if on the earth crying out to God God people were changed I mean people were changing those services see people worshiping they never seen worship before people were enjoy seeing people broken but being restored was wonderful as the book of acts going on right there amen that's my testimony from Camp Alleluia amen praise the look so it was wonderful I mean so now I've read here we've read a few a few scriptures and I want you to notice there's a pattern here Moses was called up into the presence of God on Mount Sinai God gave him instructions he gave him a pattern that just it just wasn't the pattern of the of the tabernacle but here this is how the priesthood should be and those who are called to the priesthood what what God delivered to Moses it became material in them they were dressed for a service now the scripture tells us we are kings and priests to God right now we are kings and priests of God is not we will be one day now you are every one who is a believer who's been called by this message as a king and a priest to God does everyone everyone following me but it was Moses received the vision from God and then we read there I want this to really kind of maybe change our thinking a little bit but sees here now God tells them you shall make the garments for the priests here in verse 2 so God used Moses I'm gonna be if I'm a bit slow you know I just am gonna be a bit slow I maybe get the preaching after a while but just just stay with me this is very fundamental because what God God has a pattern in the scripture and he does the same thing I'm gonna go from Moses then I'm going to go to Paul and then I'm going to go to this day amen because this is not just history the Old Testament is not just a history book or or something that doesn't apply to us that's a shadow the Apostle Paul says in the book of Hebrews the law is but a shadow but the reality is Christ so the priesthood that was there in the Old Testament was just a shadow of the reality which we're in today amen but you see only those who addressed only those who addressed by the Prophet could stand as a priest only those who addressed it wasn't those who just decided well I feel like being a priest today and I'll try and you know be partaker of the altar and do different things it was God had to call them amen and the Prophet had to dress them and if they were not dressed according to what the prophet saw in heaven I mean the vision he received on the mountain if they were not dressed according to that they couldn't be a priest amen and even some of some of Aaron's sons they took strange firing before God and God killed them they meant now you say well we're under a season of grace we are under a season of grace but God doesn't change god has a provided way and we must come according to his provided way and he gives us the power by His Spirit to be the priest and king it's not us doing it I y'all feel like doing this today God calls you God speaks to you God draws you you respond to his call and he wants to use you for a purpose it's not just to fill a seat on a Sunday morning or have a different kind of lifestyle you're a king and priest to God God wants to put you in service holily just like David David was carrying fruit from his father to his brothers in the battle he was serving the body and he just found an enemy come upon his way but he was serving serving in the body hey amen and when the good guys made his boast he says well I'm just serving in the body but how did this men defy the armies of the Living God hallelujah and he defeated that devil and it's got to be the same thing with us you got to serve in the body friends we're not here to see what we can we can just get what can we give I'm in the body every joint supplies the needs hallelujah says not like what can I get out of it God place me in the body that I can strengthen the body I'm in one I mean two is better than one hallelujah and God wants a church he wants a body that everyone's in their position fulfilling what they mean to fulfill that the whole body functions Amen so we're going to be in our place God wants to place us in the body hallelujah so now Moses came I'm just gonna Moses came and he was told you dressed them you dressed them they came out of we're gonna read in 1st Peter 2 here the Apostle Peter is now speaking about us wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envies and evil-speaking lay it aside don't speak ill of each other amen don't speak ill of each other as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby who wants to grow amen first thing is lay aside all malice and strife and envy who cares about those things it's just you and God I went to camp for me I think I see that the Sunday before camp I'm going for me hallelujah and God came and met my needs amen you talk about lifting burdens I say glory to God take it to the Lord and leave it there we're all in a battle when all immune from the devil trying to bog us down and and put a put a heaviness on us and and tell us it's not for you and you know let's just this just settle down we're not here to relax and the seats of we enter into rest you understand I'm enriched but we're in a battle is a season for fighting and we're fighting there's a season for resting eternally we're resting but this let's buckle on the whole armor I mean let's let's push the devil out hallelujah let's push him out of every life amen why should we settle back and just you know I heard a brother in our Auckland I'm just gonna deliver my heart today amen you know and he said we're not cool to be peacekeepers with the devil just you have this part I'll have this plate everything's fine that's not where there's not what we call - dude the priesthood was vital in Israel I mean because that was the connection with God and when the priesthood was strong the people were strong I mean when the people claims to God and say you'll be my god we'll be your people hallelujah they took the land I mean they drove out the enemy when the priesthood was strong as the same thing in a family when they when the husband is strong in God I mean them I mean the family will prosper when the husband and wife are one and purpose working together hallelujah you got to remember husband and wife for one amen you are one unit some people you looking at me like what you're one flesh and if you're strong you should do every single nurse of heart we're gonna serve God amen we're gonna you know the Bible says that we can now this is just me but no it's not just me but the Bible says you have a piece of passes all understanding Amen that what Christ Christ is to the church husbands are defeated their wives and what the churches what the brightest to Christ the wife is to be the husband to the husband amen so that units strong hallelujah you know season Peter you know speaking about the mean don't don't you know love your wife and all these things that your prayers are not hindered it's not it's actually your what the husband does will hinder the praise I'm just kind of putting it out there that's what the scripture says but we call to be one unit you know we're not we're not called just to be in a constant state of trench warfare you know where we've got our bunkers we've got our frontline and we have no man's land and there's the devil and he's got his bunkers in his front line and we're just firing artillery barrage us and maybe doing some you know I heard now this is not exactly trench warfare but in World War two the Soviets apparently from I may be wrong in the distance but it was the same casualty rate I think it was from Stalingrad to Berlin or something they lost ten men for virtually every meter of ground or something that they took or every hundred meters or something that was the cost of the life for them to overthrow the Nazi regime now we're not called to take casualties that way he's following me we're called but we're not called the sit back and let him have his field day he comes at I mean but this is the day of his power this is the day of his power it has never been there has never been the power of the gospel as of this day this is the strongest the gospel has ever been as today the power of God has been loosed in a greater way today than it ever has been amen because the enemy is far greater today than he ever has been when the enemy comes in like a flood God said I'll raise up a standard and that standard as his anointing and his people that is suspended he's lifted up his word hallelujah he's lifted up a standard amen the enemy is coming like a flood there's a time in revelations chapter 9 where two hundred thousand thousand demons will leave where we're loosed and that is this season that they have been loosed so there's more demon power upon the earth than there ever has been amen but God doesn't leave us amen at the you know at the whim of the devil what he wants to do his powers always greater hallelujah greater that is in you that is in the world hallelujah now he says now that you may grow thereby and if so you have tasted the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house about me a holy priesthood see Peter saying you're a priesthood a me to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone electra sheis that he that believeth on him shall not be confounded that administers Jesus Christ himself he he's a chief Cornerstone and to you thereby which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word now this is not what I'm majoring on but this is what we're eating being disobedient whereby also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people now that word peculiar doesn't mean strange it means the precious people it doesn't actually mean oh these people are but weird the world is actually weird we have it all the way around the wrong way the world is actually the weird ones amen the believer is not the weird one because this is what God ordained people to be right anything that is outside what God ordained to beat that's weird so now that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past you were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy hallelujah so now it's like the here comes Israel out of Egypt they're a bunch of slaves they have no priesthood there they have no way of of approach to God all they have is a promise from the past and then God calls them out of out of Egypt and now there has to be God has to put his how he wants it to be for them to worship Him so God has to take her people and he has to change now remember the you know the law of the Old Testament God talks about how they should dress who can marry who who can't marry who what they should eat what they should do the law covers every part of their life because they were in chaos in Egypt they were just slaves but now God when he speaks his word he takes chaos and turns it into order like in Genesis 1 darkness covered the world your water covered the earth you know it was just chaos and then God said let there be light and he began to separate light from darkness and he brought forth the land and he and he and he brought an order and when he had finished speaking there was an Eden that's what happens order comes out of chaos when God speaks but when the devil begins to speak order turns into chaos it's the other way around this is why the devil's been speaking in these you know since since the fall of man the devil has been preaching and his preaching caused the fall in the beginning through the serpent and look at the cows we have out here when we have the technology I mean we have everything we have need off to eradicate most diseases to take away famine to bring actually like a kind of a mature millenium upon the earth does man not have it we have all these things but yet the world is in chaos the world is falling apart and man seems did sit I'm destroying each other and destroying the very earth they live on its how does so why is that because the devil has been speaking and people have been listening and this is why we have this chaos but now when God speaks and a people listen it takes them out of chaos and brings them into order only it brings him into harmony with him that was the reason for the law remember under the blood of bulls and goats man and God could never become one like we are under the blood of Jesus Christ because the blood of bulls and goats could not change a person's nature they still had that full of nature I mean because they because the life of an animal could never come and change a person is a different order of life that's why God became a man hallelujah that he would become our lamb amen that his life he shed his blood he took your place hallelujah his life was given for your life I mean freely it was given hallelujah and so now but it wasn't that's not the final end of it now he dies that his life was coming to you that he would reconcile you with himself as the Apostle Paul says and Corinthians I believe it was in the last chapter he says we have the Ministry of reconciliation I mean that man and God that's the reason for the preaching of the gospel that God and man would become reconciled hallelujah that they would have peace again and it's not God that's out of order people are out of order hallelujah and that's why God has to come and change our nature that in the Davis power we become willing hallelujah if there's anything in us that's that as fighting against his word you should be in prayer change my heart change my ways that I become reconciled to your word we all have to do it that's what a real repentance are dying out is is where we say Lord changed my heart that I will live according to your word that's what real salvation is is because once upon a time we were doing anything we wanted to do we heard about it at camp Ephesians chapter 2 we walked according to the spirit of this world we did whatever we want it it says in Romans not one man seeks after God but then he comes and he becomes he he comes to draw you because he wants to reconcile you with him hallelujah that's what he wants to do and then so but then because we have a free moral agency we have to be willing lord take you you have to give it to him and say change my heart hallelujah amen than anything you have given in your word for me to do I'm willing it's just like a very simple thing water baptism Christine's dead brother Albert it was baptized and the titles back in Switzerland River it was it comes to New Zealand and then God begins to deal with them are going to be rebaptised name a Lord Jesus Christ but there's a struggle going on in his mind but then he comes to realize what spirit would stop me from fulfilling God's Word and he realizes just the demon spirit and then when it got baptized hallelujah it should be the same thing with anything Amen how we act how we dress how things we do things we watch whatever it may be I don't know this world this world is preached to you know what Hollywood is you know what all these ungodly things are that sermons it's sermons goddess because movies are more just entertainment they're conveying a message and they're actually written and made in such a way because they want to get a message across and they just have a whole bunch of Technology and CGI and everything and they can make it so amazing and you begin to enjoy people enjoy you know the film or whatever it is because it's entertainment and they open up their spirits because they're enjoying it and a message slips in' and haw and people's thinking and everything they do has been changed because there sitting listening to a message that's what it is Allu you not praise our God but I think praise our God because we can see these things we should not be ignorant to the devil's devices and the devil's not stupid I think sometimes we well not we should give him credit but he's not stupid he knows how man works he studies you he's been studying he was studying men in the garden and he's studying men now and the more you study something the more you learn and the more you understand it he knows all human nature's he knows how to war against you yes amen and that's why everything's so tailor-made amen even even you take now this is even like restaurants you know you take like McDonald's and so on they actually do studies about how they should have their lighting how they should have they'd be cool how they should have their seats how fast the food comes how big the portions are those things actually have committees and plans and they study these things they look because it's being refined down how can we get the most turnover what's the optimum time we want people to be in a seat people studied these things now that's just food how much more the devil wants to take the sons and daughters of God because he's determined because he knows God can't lose a part of himself he knows he saw it and the last thing Adam did as a god was he joined himself with his wife because he knew that the God could not destroy him and so God knows sorry Satan knows that God cannot lose part of himself and if and if Satan can get one he's won and that's why he fights against you he say I'm going through a battle praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm going through such a mind battle hallelujah why is that because the devil is trying to weigh you down he's trying to get you to surrender put up your white flag Amen because you have something that he wants and you're not willing to give it hallelujah no price can buy it you don't want to give yourself to him you've given yourself to another hallelujah this the Lord Jesus Christ hey man you say well I feel very trapped there's a deliverance I mean to set you free hallelujah just because you got my battles don't let the devil make you think you're not a believer I have mine battles I'm just going to tell you so because some people think how can those and their Christian didn't know everyone has mine battles everyone has struggles everyone has Hard Day's if one has valleys of hard experience and you're wondering Lord where is the way out how is this ever going to end up we all have it amen but then also at the same time if he god has allowed you to go through it and he leads you through it you'd have confidence if your will is surrendered to Hennis all you want is this perfect world sometimes it's how we go into his permissive will and then we end up wandering down some garden path and we give God credit for leading us there it's not always the case amen but you got to say and then if you find yourself down that way you say Lord forgive me get me back on the road hallelujah as brother Danny was saying you know these things called familiar spirits and we become familiar with a spirit amen and we shouldn't be and the thing is we get used to being a certain way that's why we are creatures of habit because there's something called the familiar spirit and we're familiar with it a spirit of a family or maybe our workplace or our school or our country we use that spirit and we begin to think that's us that's why they're in Egypt and God called them out there because he wants to get him to know you're not used you don't mean to be familiar with the spirits of Egypt you mean to be I want you to be familiar with my Spurs so I call you out he's called us out and he brought them into the wilderness and now God shows Moses this is how my priesthood is going to be and anyone who is dressed outside of that way was not a priest they could be religious they could offer sacrifices they could take incense they could do whatever they tried to do but God had to dress them through the word of a prophet okay now I got to see where we are he sees us in Hebrews chapter 8 who serve unto the example and the shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that they'll make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the Mount so he was instructed what you see on the Mount you ought to make it upon the earth it's not just the tabernacle it's the priesthood what's good having the what's good having the tabernacle of wilderness without people I mean to minister in that tabernacle I mean what's the good of having the church building I mean without having the people it's not about the building it's about the people I mean God doesn't want a you know a nice building I mean he wants people giving spiritual price sacrifice to him hallelujah now but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises for if the first covenant had been faultless there should have no place being sought for the second so he's talking about contrasting Moses in Jesus's ministry so he is a mediator of a better covenant mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises we have better promises than the Old Testament they meant we have better promises than just a denominational group hallelujah we have better promises than just a past age he says this for finding fault with him he said behold the days come saith the Lord I'll make a new covenant with the house of Israel with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that took them by the hand to lead them to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not with my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord he's talking about you to remember i will put my laws in their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people this is what are you saying this is what I'm gonna do I'm going to take my laws my word I'm going to put it not just I'm gonna put in their mind and I'm gonna write it in their hearts hallelujah amen and I will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people this is what he's promising and we are this is where we're living that God takes his word writes it in your heart takes a table of your heart and writes it in there because it's like we are like a computer a computer has programming it has software does it not computerhead software and the computer can only operate by the one the hardware but then to the software to make the hardware go there hey brother George yeah well you're there you're one of the experts here you're a software engineer so I see shaking here but maybe you're going off the wrong way but you have to have the right software now you can have the same computer but then you can wipe out the software give it new software and alap right differently it's the same thing with God and you know we are actually just one big battery we're organic battery do you not know anyway we won't do you not know that maybe I'll share a few diagrams I'll show you how the cell works where one big battery anyway but God takes us we were born with the wrong programming because we're born in a fallen nature the devil by the Fallen Eden gave us the wrong programming and that's why you have killing in your blood sugar of hatred and malice and strife and envy and selfishness and pride because that's his programming but then God has to come and he's got a he's got a more than just he's got a totally erratic hey I'm in the programming and he's got to rewrite your life he's going to give you a new programming that you begin to operate a different way not the same way as you Winston hallelujah how can you operate Amen if you say I've been rewritten how can you operate the old way I mean because you're programming you know I may have said this many times I don't have to avoid being trapped in the world I don't have to avoid video games and movies and rock and roll music and drinking and the pubs and whatever more I don't have to say Lord don't let me get near those places Kirby dragged in my programming has been changed my perfect everything says hallelujah and it's not just an update it's a total revamp hallelujah hallelujah ami we've been rebooted worried you gotta be rebooted hallelujah if you haven't been rebooted say God reboot me reinstall my life hallelujah that's because he says I'll take my word I'll write it in your heart that's your operating system I'll take my operating system and I write it in you and you'll be my people amen and I'll be your God hallelujah that's how it's got to be I mean so now that was that was there that was there in the Old Testament now we're coming to Jesus ministry and now it changes is happening they are under the law but now as a dispensational change we're now here comes grace and then now Jesus comes the lamb comes he's been given his spirit now has been real released upon the people and then now the Apostle Paul says in a few places a dispensation of the gospel has been given to me so God has now taken a man he takes him out into Arabia different place he says in Galatians I went into Arabia after I meet the Lord on the road to Damascus and he began to look into the Old Testament to see who was this being that I met on the road and he began to find out the same God that met Moses had met him and then God begins to anoint him to write most of the Newton estimate but they notice what he goes through he so first he he shows us just like Moses he says the Lord thy God is one you know he begins to show the deity of God and then he goes into how and then you read a lot of his writings how we should dress how parents should be how children should be we should abstain from fornication and and you know or adultery or all those things he he late and he goes down to every part of the life this is how the family should be and you would think being a Jew you'd say but we had all these things under Moses but what God now God was turning a corner it was a new dispensation and a lot of them had to one come out of out of old religion but it was all the Gentiles had to come out from their idols just like coming out of Egypt they had to forsake their idols they were called out of Egypt but now they had to go into Christ so that's why the Apostle Paul under this dispensation he says now he he he says this other family should be are you following me because he's saying it's not just a priesthood of a men that's now the whole congregation's our priesthood hallelujah so now everyone has to be dressed everyone has to be spiritually dressed I mean by the word that was delivered to that prophet hallelujah because remember you'd say well well that seems a lot less greater than what happened in the Old Testament no it's greater what is greater you say Moses Moses you know putting after he's seen the vision on the mountain and he and he puts together the Tabernacle in the wilderness and they have the priesthood and they and they apply the blood and all different things than the glory of the Lord fills the tabernacle now that would have been an amazing thing and then that was repeated again when Solomon built the temple but was that greater or was it greater than they have Pentecost I mean where there was a hundred and twenty people 120 priests I mean I mean they've been under the Ministry of Jesus Christ maybe the Ministry of Jesus Christ was continued through the Apostles are you all following me I pray you really are I mean so now what's greater that happens what happened in Solomon's Temple or what happened on the day of Pentecost I say it was great what happened on the day of Pentecost with the same God that we'd down to the holy of holies now came in 12th and 120 people that's a flag greater glory hallelujah so he begins to tell the people this is how you should be this is how you should trace this is how you should treat each other because they've been in chaos now they're coming into order and he says if any man is spiritual let him acknowledge that the things I teach of the commandments of the Lord amen she had to be willing to receive that word receive that instruction I don't want to be a half dressed priest and if you look in the scripture if you continue to read an exodus they were anointed and then they were dressed amen you can't just be a half dressed priest you ought to be fully dressed by this word you're following me and be fully dressed and then so now it came in order but then what happened as people then but then the enemy start to come into the church and formalism came in and creeds of men came in and then finally they came into a chaos of a dark age that was cast because the devil was speaking and now they're in chaos but then God said I will restore and God called out Luther but they came out with a lot of chaos but they had a little bit of water because I just shall live by faith and then Wesley came and there's all different parts of the Reformation as he as the bright tree was regrowing hallelujah but they still had a lot of chaos because they had a lot of denomination man's ideas but here we are in the end here we are on the end now this is why I said I was going to go Moses I'm going Paul and I'm coming down to this age because what's good just talking about history and this is really real really want to get to in this message it is so now here comes God says behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the father's that you're part of the scripture to be fulfilled I mean so he will preach a word hallelujah he says that I think in the church age book is those divine mystery truths will literally turn the hearts of the children to the father's amen so you say well I don't understand it but there's an anointing there's a Spirit of God coming through the word and it causes you you'll have to be turned hallelujah well yet Peter spake these words the Spirit of God fell upon them I mean and they were bunches living under the law a former age and then they found themselves in the current age hallelujah was malicious blood of bulls and goats but the very Messiah had come hallelujah now he is living in them hallelujah and so now he says oh I'll send you Elijah the Prophet he's been seen but why was he sent to cool the people out of chaos and bring them into order that they can be spiritual priests and kings unto our God that's why his ministry was safe it's not just a know some more stuff or or or quote a man a man who said God would come and it was God speaking by the way I mean I wouldn't put myself above a prophet by trying to say is this a Moses him or is this his idea is this God I'd say Lord there's enough as I've said it before God's character and his life has preached through those servants amen and what God loves and what he hates has ministered through those servants a prophet a man has a perfect balance in the scripture it's not his leaning this way or this way I mean when a prophet is perfectly balanced where God would come down and use that vessel I mean the Apostle Paul wasn't leaning one way amen that was God's perfect balance when he wrote thee when he when he preached and when he wrote the New Testament there wasn't his idea I mean people call him a woman-hater all different kinds of things he wasn't a woman-hater that was God this is this is God making himself known and the people that received that word they were dressed they were placed in a priesthood hallelujah Amen that's the same thing in our day it was chaos so many loose ends the part of the Ministry of Malachi fools take all the loose ends that the Reformers were proving it is that this in the Bible is of this in the Bible what are the seals mean what is all this and all this and then God says I'll show you hallelujah as he three is he five is he to z1 I'll show you he's one he is manifests himself in different ways hallelujah all the difference so we're being called out of chaos but now we have to come into order I'm gonna read this let's just I don't have this on my notes malicious go to Luke 17 this is very familiar scripture but we have more we have more than religion you notice there yeah you who are there on Sunday Sunday night that wasn't the music working people up that wasn't the that was God coming down that was God coming down and God made every every need it wasn't a bunch of work up by people I mean he didn't even need to say you know unlike Priya it was like here what a bust Ana barricaded and jumpin hallelujah cuz God was calling hallelujah and you won't find it I don't believe you won't find that anywhere else you can search YouTube you'll end up disappointed I mean we don't need a bunch of lights and a bunch of dark and a bunch of loud stuff and you know it's God comes that's that old time religion hallelujah and it was good for them I'll take what worked hey if it if it took Elijah Anna and a chariot of fire hallelujah but if it you know ever brought Jesus out of the grave even if it filled the Apostles filled the disciples on day of Pentecost if it gave them over Cameron power if it works hey you know hasn't been tested it's been tested hasn't been proven that's been proven I'll take it there hallelujah amen it's like if they had like Google you know people can write stuff and be all five stars and I think maybe I'll just be testimonies and then it works amen now we're a yes so Luke 17 and we'll just read we're just going to read verse 30 but if you read it before and after it's speaking Jesus's what its gonna be like at the end and it speaks in the days of nor in the days of lot and we can see that that is here this is in verse 30 even thou shalt be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed that's when God has revealed again the Son of Man is Jesus Christ so when you see the world of the condition at son he will be revealed he will be revealed now that is more than a prophetic gift but that is his word being seen him declaring himself so the same God that met Moses on the Mount Sinai was the same God that was that same God had a body he dwelt in it they meant that's Jesus Christ and that same God was there in the upper room and the same God has been walking through the church ages and the same God is here hallelujah the very same one and so nice is even that shall be when the Son of Man is revealed now the revealing of the Son of Man is Jesus Christ being made known again this has happened I know you say well we all believe all these things but I wanted to enter down a little bit more because you've got to look at now why did God do this to call the people out of chaos bring them into order with himself that they will be dressed to be in a priesthood and that's all of us man woman boy girl old young we we all have a part of this ministry now this is all years no way I have the English here I'll read the English there's the Spanish okay so this is an event made clear by prophecy this is the end of the service there's a 1965 Oh God Jesus manifested god of the word you see it as it was the days of Sodom the word the world would be in that condition just before the destruction of the Gentile world this is where we're living the Gentile dispensation here we are sodomites to the core speaking of this world then you see that the son of man which has always referred - as a profit would be revealed in that our fulfill my words our God we you're believing children wait with sincere hearts to give us faith Lord that when we have the prayer line the people will believe that it's the evening time father that the evening lights of the Son of God he that was which is and shall come manifest himself by the prophecy that he made and Jesus Christ name Amen would you know this is just a little bit doubted just after that priests is would you believe if God would manifest himself ensure that he is here alive doing the same things that he did at the beginning after this message would you accept it as your healing may God grant it now I'm asking anybody in the house no matter who you are where you're from I'm asking you just to solemnly believe this message to be the truth that is the message that God has in his Bible for this hour that Jesus Christ is here tonight and as alive he says now nearly now nearly and then just down a bit he says you believe it a lady sitting here before me now says remember God when Jesus was here in flesh he knew the thoughts of the people in you everything about them that same ministry is repeated again in this last day the ministry happened there amen that a people would be called out of chaos to come into a priesthood why I would and this is repeated again in this last day he says you believe it a lady sitting here before me looking at me tears in her eyes sincerely I don't know who she is never seen her I'm a stranger to you do you think God knows the secret of your heart your desires or your sin or whatever it is you think he knows he's talking to one lady here you think he could reveal to me what your sin is what you've done well you ought not to have done or your desire whatever it is if he would do it would it make you believe him know that it has to be him would you accept that as him it's not your sin that's bothering you you have confessed that but your wine the baptism of his Holy Spirit you shall receive it I seen it move down across her that you might know is looking at the woman she was looking at me I want to show you the Holy Spirit look here right over this little woman sitting here down beneath my feet here when I said that that's the same thing she wants as the baptism of the Holy Ghost you believe that you will receive it sister raise up your hand I never seen the woman of my life knowingly see this man right oh you see this man sitting here with us head down this is the same service sitting right here with us caller miss fitting him and so forth you suffer with the bladder trouble you believe that God will make you well raise up your hand if you'll accept it all right God grant

today and forever ask those people see if I know them I don't but he does amen see that light on the side of the wall yonder hanging down over a man sitting back there he is suffering with a spinal condition in his back he's not from me and he's from Georgia mr. Duncan believe with all your heart God will heal that back trouble you believe with all your heart god bless you here's a man sitting back here with back trouble looking at me I don't know him but it's mr. Thompson you believe me raise up sir back there I'm a stranger to you that's right but you're sitting here you're sitting there praying you're back trouble is healed now Jesus Christ makes you well now why don't I take the time to read that out because it's the same ministry that Jesus Christ had it would return through a prophet but it was all done that you would know here comes God has come in this end time to call the people out of chaos I mean that they would come to order they would come under order to him hallelujah so now here comes a prophet now I'm just gonna I'm just going to sum it up Moses went up a mountain he received a word and through that word he dressed a priesthood that they could operate as a priesthood and then here comes Jesus and his ministry continues through the Apostles hallelujah and then Paul now writes most of the New Testament and he receives a word and in an order of priesthood will be dressed amen this is not far-fetched go go read the scripture Alleluia he he receives the word and it covers every part of the people's lives amen because there's a change of dispensation right then if people would know how to live how to treat each other you know and what to do because God wants them dressed that they would be in a priesthood them have come through a Dark Age we're in chaos now in order God sends Malachi for upon the earth amen and he receives the word which is the same revelation that the Apostle Paul received a meant that all of man's chaos would be done away with that a people had come into order then that would be put into a priesthood but you have to receive it all to be dressed have you basically that's it you got to receive the whole word well that was it him or was it God just take it he say Lord who wants to be a priest and King to God because if God has a provider wait you say well everyone else has the Bible and thinks but what about the revelation contained in the Bible we have Bibles we have multitudes of Bibles but we all fuss and fight who's right who's wrong and people have their schools in there and their study and everything and there and there and they all come to disagreements god daughter he says he never said the way the Lord comes to a theologian says the word Lord came to a prophet he says older nothing to I shot to my prophets my servers are proverbs first amen so that's why he was said that we can be drift there we can be kings and priests hallelujah but if you don't whatever you do don't try and sidestep around there it's like them coming into the wedding supper it's one door into the wedding supper and then everyone's robbed the same way if one's been anointed and made welcome in their own and there's someone without a wedding garment on and in the king of the feces friend how did you get in here and it doesn't say anything yeah he must have got him through a window and he gets tied up and throw it out cuz he didn't come and God's provided way you say well what does girls provide away repent repent and real repentance is where you are reconciled with God where it's not not one part of you is fighting against him fighting against his word for your land full agreement that's a full repentance a full surrender repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ remission of sin that God's gonna work in your life and you shall you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise to you as to you those who are afar off a lot of us were afar off hallelujah we were afar off but it called us let's promise to you your children see see see you parents if you have received it it's for your children hallelujah I just take God in His Word Thank You law your Holy Ghost is for my children it's for me who believes it's for you I just say yes maybe don't look at where you are your situation doesn't matter God's promises the one that matters I mean this is an unconditional covenant with us and God and as God says I have made you thus it shall be so that's for he is obligated to keep us into the bargain or we have to a syringe and say let it be unto me according to thy word amen we you know God is the one who's got to make his word come to pass we just have to surrender and allow him to do it says to us as to our children as many as are afar off as many as the Lord our God shall call it's really that simple but a word has come to dress us there be kings and priests to God I mean clear some musicians please I encourage your friends if there's anything in your heart you're like no I don't want to that you're fighting against the word you pray you pray and say God take that out of me take it out of me Lord purge me of it I'm in his blood as blood is here to purge us two washes are the changes amen it's just um I'm not sure what to sing
