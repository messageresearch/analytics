[2:24] doing well this evening. Let's just
[2:26] stand as we open in a word of prayer.
[2:31] Welcome back, Bailey's.
[2:34] Let's bow our heads. Thank you, Lord,
[2:36] for this wonderful day you've given us,
[2:38] Lord. That we could all come here and
[2:40] gathered here in your name, Lord, to
[2:42] come and hear from you once again, Lord.
[2:43] And Lord, I just pray that Lord, you
[2:45] said two to three, if two or three are
[2:47] gathered in your name, you'd be there in
[2:48] the midst, Lord. And we've come
[2:50] believing tonight, Lord, that you'd be
[2:52] here. And Lord, I just pray you feel
[2:53] welcome in this place, Lord. Feel
[2:56] welcome amongst us, Lord. And Lord, I
[2:57] pray for those that couldn't make it
[2:58] tonight. Be their portion, Lord. Lord, I

[27:18] &gt;&gt; The greatest one that could ever be
[27:20] spoken about, him. Praise the Lord. God
[27:23] bless you all. Thank you, Josh. Thank
[27:25] you, musicians. Good to see everyone
[27:27] here tonight on this Wednesday. Uh, a
[27:29] bit of a change of schedule, but here I
[27:31] am. Praise the Lord. Jimmy will be here
[27:34] soon. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Happy
[27:37] birthday, brother Ben.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[27:41] Amen. Great to have the Bailey's home.
[27:43] God bless you. So, praise the Lord.
[27:45] Great to have you. Amen. Let's uh let's
[27:47] turn the scripture, shall we, to uh Job
[27:50] 38
[27:53] and verses
[27:55] 4-7.
[28:02] And I'd like to, if I could title this
[28:04] tonight, I'd like to speak about looking
[28:06] at the big picture. We're big picture
[28:09] people.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, they say the devil's in the
[28:12] detail. Actually, God's in the detail,
[28:14] but he's in the big picture. He's in the
[28:15] big the the the
[28:17] focused in view and the zoomed out view.
[28:19] He's in everything. So, I mean, so God
[28:22] would ask Job in Job 38:4-7, "Where was
[28:25] thou when I laid the foundations of the
[28:27] earth? declare if thou hast
[28:28] understanding. Who hath laid the t um
[28:31] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[28:33] thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the
[28:35] line upon it? Whereupon are the
[28:37] foundations thereof fastened? Or who
[28:39] laid the cornerstone thereof? When the
[28:41] morning stars sang together, and all the
[28:44] sons of God shouted for joy. Praise the
[28:47] Lord. Amen. Let's bow heads in a word of
[28:50] prayer. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we
[28:53] praise your great name this night. We
[28:55] want to lift you up high, Lord. Help us
[28:57] to lift you higher. I pray, Father,
[29:00] you're so worthy. You're so good to us.
[29:02] We thank you. We can bow our heads in
[29:04] your divine presence and just say, "We
[29:06] love you and you're so great." Just
[29:08] pray, dear God, you'd anoint your word,
[29:10] anoint speaker and hear her one more
[29:11] time. Just want to get ourselves out of
[29:13] the way that you can speak. You can do
[29:15] what you want to do in our midst, Lord.
[29:16] Not just here, but those who are
[29:17] streaming be our portion. We love you so
[29:20] much. We commit this service. We plead
[29:22] your blood over our lives. May the evil
[29:24] one be bound in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:26] that you'd have preeminence and your
[29:27] children can reach up and receive every
[29:29] divine promise that you've given in
[29:31] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you friends. You can
[29:35] have your seats tonight. So I want to
[29:37] speak about looking looking at the big
[29:39] picture.
[29:40] We must always have everything in
[29:43] perspective. And when you look at the
[29:45] big picture, you actually see things
[29:46] what they really are. as we read here in
[29:49] the in our in our scripture this uh uh
[29:52] uh tonight where you know Job was in the
[29:54] trial of his life. He was he'd never
[29:56] been tested in this at at all to this
[29:59] degree and he had lost his children. He
[30:01] had lost all of his livestock and even
[30:04] his own wife said, "Won't you just curse
[30:05] God and die?" Cuz she was so uh uh one
[30:09] she was suffering the loss of her
[30:10] children. But she was seeing your
[30:11] husband uh be afflicted in the way he
[30:14] was. And they didn't have the answers as
[30:16] what was going on. And so she even said
[30:18] just just curse God and die. But Job
[30:20] would say, "Well, the Lord gives the
[30:21] Lord takes away. Blessed be his name."
[30:23] And you know, and then then then Job's
[30:25] friends would come to him and and and
[30:26] and they would try and get him to
[30:28] confess he's a secret sinner cuz they
[30:30] were looking at the there and now and
[30:32] they're trying to work out what the
[30:33] reason behind this all was. But they
[30:35] couldn't see the bigger picture. And
[30:37] they couldn't see the bigger picture
[30:38] that God was proving his word upon the
[30:40] earth. That God was proving his perfect
[30:42] servant. Amen. His perfect one upon the
[30:44] earth which was Job. And you know, they
[30:46] couldn't see that even Job himself could
[30:48] not see. Amen. the the the value God had
[30:51] placed upon him and what God testified
[30:53] of him of being a perfect man. But you
[30:56] see, God would come at the end of his
[30:58] trial and he'd say, "Job, I'm going to
[30:59] show you the big picture. I'm going to
[31:01] show you where you were. I'm going to
[31:03] show you where you end up because
[31:04] whatever is in eternity remains in
[31:06] eternity. There's no start or beginning
[31:08] there." So you can say, but we say,
[31:10] "Well, we started somewhere." We have
[31:12] because we're creatures of time. As
[31:14] brother Ed was preaching, you know,
[31:15] we're outside of time, but you know,
[31:16] we're creatures of time. We we always
[31:18] think of where did everything begin?
[31:20] Where did we begin? When people you know
[31:22] children will ask how did God begin? We
[31:25] say you know even Williams he's you know
[31:27] caught up in numbers. He always asks me
[31:29] what's bigger than infinity. I say
[31:31] there's nothing bigger than infinity.
[31:32] Infinity is like God cuz God is God is
[31:35] in maths. Praise God. Amen. So you see
[31:39] but yeah so we always looking for a
[31:40] beginning and a how do we start and you
[31:42] know but but we never really did begin.
[31:44] Amen. We are we are part of God. Amen.
[31:47] We just came down into this space of
[31:50] time as brother would call it a hickey
[31:52] on the circle of eternity and we would
[31:54] come into these flesh bodies to these
[31:56] veils of humiliation to go you be
[31:59] tempted, tested and tried and go through
[32:00] all manners of things that God would
[32:03] develop a character in us. But the
[32:05] character that he develops in us, he's
[32:06] already seen it before the foundation of
[32:08] the world. Amen. So we're just becoming
[32:10] what we always were ordained to be. So
[32:13] for the Christian this uh tonight, we
[32:15] can say we had no beginning because
[32:17] we're part of God. We're God's
[32:19] offspring. Amen. And if we're part, you
[32:21] know, if we're God's children, it's easy
[32:22] to say we're sons and daughters of God.
[32:24] That means we're his offspring. We're
[32:26] made in his likeness. Amen. We're
[32:28] eternal as God is eternal. And the word
[32:31] always comes to eternal beings. Amen.
[32:33] Even as Jesus would say, didn't the
[32:35] spirit of go, you know, the word of the
[32:37] Lord come to the prophets and he called
[32:38] them gods. Amen. And the word of the
[32:40] Lord has come to you. Amen. as well. Not
[32:42] just the prophet or the prophets, but
[32:44] the word has come to you in the form of
[32:46] revelation. Amen. So, you know, we are
[32:49] God's offspring. We're made in his
[32:51] image. We may be in these fallen bodies,
[32:53] but our souls are made in his image.
[32:55] Amen. So, we never had a beginning and
[32:57] we never will have an end. The devil had
[32:59] a start date. He's got an expiry date.
[33:01] He's going to have a destruction day.
[33:03] Amen. But we will never end. Amen. Where
[33:06] when he's not even a memory, we will
[33:07] still be. Amen. and will be rejoicing,
[33:10] shouting for eternity, but he will come
[33:12] to an end. And I believe he won't even
[33:14] be a memory.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; So this is the big picture. This is this
[33:19] is always it's important to keep things
[33:20] in perspective. Now the big picture,
[33:22] it's a noun and it's the entire
[33:24] perspective on a situational issue. So
[33:27] that's the big picture. We in our finite
[33:30] human minds, we actually look at a lot
[33:32] of things not in the entire perspective.
[33:35] That's why we get stressed. That's why
[33:37] we get anxious. That's why we get
[33:38] worried. That's why we we we allow our
[33:41] minds to be plagued with doubts and
[33:43] questions because we're only seeing
[33:45] things in a in a partial perspective.
[33:47] Amen. But but God wants us to see the
[33:49] big picture and the big picture is
[33:51] according to his word. Amen. The big
[33:53] picture is not based on what your five
[33:55] senses declare or what you imagine or
[33:58] reason or think or no. The big picture
[34:00] is a revelation of his word. I mean if
[34:02] we can see everything by the big picture
[34:04] that everything is working for our good.
[34:06] Amen. That God is molding us. He's
[34:08] shaping us. That that, you know, God
[34:10] will never be defeated. Amen. He will
[34:12] never He's gonna every single one of his
[34:15] children are going to be there on that
[34:16] day. It doesn't matter what they drag
[34:18] through through life. That's irrelevant.
[34:20] They're coming out the other side. Amen.
[34:22] So, we can look at everything by a big
[34:24] picture perspective. Amen. I love this.
[34:27] This is a scripture that um uh brother
[34:29] Mach had in his in his sermon. This
[34:32] really gripped me. Uh he says, "Tell
[34:34] tell ye and bring them near. Yay, let
[34:37] them take counsel together. Who hath
[34:39] declared this from ancient time? Or who
[34:41] hath told it from that time? Have not I
[34:43] the Lord and there is no God else beside
[34:46] me? A just God and a Savior. There is
[34:48] none beside me. Look unto me and be ye
[34:50] saved all the ends of the earth. For I
[34:52] am God and there is none else." Now this
[34:54] is the scripture he had. He says, "I
[34:56] have sworn by myself. The word has gone
[34:58] out of my mouth in righteousness and it
[35:00] shall not return that unto me every knee
[35:02] shall bow and every tongue shall swear.
[35:05] So he says the word has gone out. It's
[35:08] already been released. Amen. It's not
[35:09] coming. It's gone. It's been sent out.
[35:12] And and and what's going to be the end
[35:14] result of this word going out is that
[35:16] every knee will bow and every tongue
[35:18] shall swear. So God has already decreed
[35:21] Satan, you're going to bow. Sickness is
[35:23] going to bow. Demons of torment are
[35:25] going to bow. Spirits of unbelief are
[35:27] going to bow. Family spirits are going
[35:29] to bow. Unbelief is going to bow.
[35:31] Reasoning is going to bow. I mean, the
[35:33] believer is going to bow in a different
[35:35] way, exalting him, Lord of glory. The
[35:37] unbeliever is going to bow as well.
[35:39] Amen. Satan's going to bow. HELL'S GOING
[35:40] TO BOW. I MEAN, EVERYTHING WILL BOW CUZ
[35:42] THE word of God has come out of his
[35:44] mouth and it will not return to him
[35:46] void. AMEN. IT WILL ACCOMPLISH that
[35:48] which he's purposed it to do. Amen. I
[35:50] tell you what, friends, WHEN HIS WORD
[35:51] WENT OUT, YOU went out cuz you're part
[35:54] of his word. Amen. You're an expression
[35:55] of his word in this end time. Amen. And
[35:57] what's going to happen? You're going to
[35:58] be placed in a position of authority and
[36:00] power. Amen. And that is and the devil's
[36:03] going to be under your feet and
[36:04] everything's going to bow to his name.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Surely one shall say this is what this
[36:10] is. You one shall say in the Lord have I
[36:13] righteousness and strength.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not my own righteousness and
[36:16] strength. It's not my human gumption and
[36:19] ability and my h religious works that I
[36:22] can boast and know. The Lord is my
[36:24] righteous. In him have I righteous and
[36:26] strength. My eyes have come open. Amen.
[36:29] To realize it's not my doing. It's his
[36:31] doing. Amen. It's his finished work that
[36:33] stands. And it's the strength of the
[36:34] Holy Ghost. Amen. It's not by power, by
[36:37] my by by my spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[36:39] Amen. Even to him shall men come and all
[36:42] that are insensed against them shall be
[36:44] ashamed. In the Lord shall all the seed
[36:46] of Israel be justified and shall glory.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; I feel that's you and I. We're spiritual
[36:51] Israel tonight.
[36:53] Praise the Lord. Now the Apostle Paul
[36:55] would pick up the scripture here in
[36:57] Isaiah 45 and he says, "Now and being
[36:59] found in fashion as a man to speak of
[37:01] our Lord Jesus, he humbled himself and
[37:03] became obedient unto death, even the
[37:05] death of the cross. Wherefore God also
[37:08] hath highly exalted him and given him a
[37:10] name which is above every name." Every
[37:13] name. I like that. That at the name of
[37:16] Jesus, every knee should bow of things
[37:18] in heaven, things in earth, and things
[37:20] under the earth. and that every tongue
[37:22] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[37:24] to the glory of God the Father. Amen. So
[37:27] now when the word became flesh, Amen.
[37:30] What what did the word do? It overcame
[37:33] in every circumstance.
[37:35] Overcame in the synagogue, overcame in
[37:38] Jerusalem, overcame against culture and
[37:41] superstition and religious spirits and
[37:44] unbelief. It overcame all those things.
[37:47] Overcame religious spirits and demons of
[37:49] torment. Everything had to bow to the
[37:51] name of Jesus Christ. And not just here,
[37:53] but then when the Lord Jesus descended
[37:55] down into hell, everything had to bow to
[37:57] him there. Everything had to give way.
[37:59] Not one spirit challenged them, saying,
[38:01] "Now you're here. I've got you." They
[38:03] knew they are in trouble. They knew that
[38:05] they were whipped. Amen. And then our
[38:06] Lord Jesus took the keys of hell, death,
[38:08] and the grave off the enemy and ascended
[38:10] victorious. Amen. Above them all. If I'm
[38:12] shouting, I'm just very moved by this.
[38:14] Amen. Because our God reigns. Amen. In
[38:17] every situation, we just get the big
[38:18] picture. We won't be fussing. WE WON'T
[38:20] BE FIGHTING. We won't be carnal. We
[38:22] won't be political. We won't try and
[38:24] manipulate. No, we'll see things in the
[38:26] big picture perspective. And we will let
[38:28] God be exalted in every every
[38:30] circumstance. Amen. So, he conquered. He
[38:33] conquered hell, death, and the grave.
[38:34] Everything that could be conquered was
[38:35] conquered that day. Amen. When he died
[38:37] that day on Calvary and descended down
[38:39] to hell, and he ascended on high and now
[38:41] he's given gifts unto men. Now, the same
[38:43] word is coming to you. Amen. We're that
[38:45] victorious one. Because the word is not
[38:47] defeated. The word is never at a
[38:50] stalemate. The word is never suffering
[38:52] loss. No. Because the word is God. And
[38:54] God is a mighty, mighty warrior. He's a
[38:57] mighty warrior. He's a mighty king.
[38:59] Amen. He's never been defeated in
[39:01] battle. He's never been fought to a
[39:02] stalemate. He's always comes out packing
[39:04] the victory in every generation. Amen.
[39:07] And see, as it was in the Lord Jesus,
[39:09] the word was made flesh and overcome and
[39:11] was victorious. So that same word has
[39:13] come to you and you're overcoming and
[39:15] you're victorious because the same one
[39:17] is now in you. Amen. Because the big p
[39:20] big picture perspective is that you
[39:22] realize you're the offspring of God.
[39:24] You're part of God. Amen. So if you're
[39:26] part of God and if he can't be defeated,
[39:29] you can't be defeated.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE FACING, LOOK
[39:33] AT THE BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE. I'M A
[39:35] CHILD OF eternity just having an
[39:37] experience in time and I'm going back
[39:39] into eternity. I came from God and I go
[39:42] back to God.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything Everything that happens
[39:49] to us in this life that's not of God is
[39:52] not eternal. It has an end time.
[39:56] It has an end time. It's coming to an
[39:58] end. Amen. Trials are temporary. They're
[40:01] very temporary. Amen. You can you can
[40:03] look back you know in eternity when we
[40:05] look backward say that was such a short
[40:07] space of time upon the earth. Amen. You
[40:11] can you can be you know even you know
[40:15] you can live 70 years like you know six
[40:17] score and 10 years are given to all men.
[40:20] That's such a nothing in in in the
[40:22] expanse of even time upon the earth. And
[40:27] we're we're here just for a little bit.
[40:29] And so every every problem that comes
[40:32] our way comes to an end. Sickness comes
[40:35] to an end. Torment comes to an end.
[40:38] Amen. Unbelief comes to an end. Amen.
[40:41] Wayward withward loved ones, them being
[40:43] lost come to an end. They don't come to
[40:45] an end. Amen. They come home. We're
[40:47] living in a season of the return.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Make room.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Kill the fatted calf.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Start celebrating.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Give praise TO GOD. I MEAN, DON'T LOOK
[40:57] BY WHAT YOU SEE WITH YOUR EYES. LOOK BY
[40:59] THE REVELATION OF THE WORD. ALL THAT
[41:01] HAVE COME TO ME, THEY will come. All the
[41:03] father's GIVEN ME WILL COME to me.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we can look WITH THE
[41:08] EYES OF FAITH because we see a big
[41:09] picture perspective. Amen. Where we can
[41:12] sit. Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; We're not just
[41:17] God has made us in such a way. Your
[41:20] prayers matter.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Your intercession matters. Your kings
[41:24] and priests of God. Amen. You got you
[41:26] got to look at your problem and say this
[41:28] is a very temporary problem. Amen. Like
[41:30] there's a lot of road cones around
[41:32] lower. They're a temporary problem.
[41:35] They're going to come to an end. Amen.
[41:37] And what has been envisaged in some
[41:38] engineer's MIND HAS BECOME MATERIAL AND
[41:40] WE'RE GOING TO hopefully enjoy the road,
[41:42] but it's a temporary thing.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; All problems in life are temporary.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; And they work for our good.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says here, he says, "For
[41:55] our light affliction." I love it how the
[41:57] Apostle Paul, he went through a lot of
[41:59] things, but he realized when the Lord
[42:01] met him on the road to Damascus and he
[42:03] looked back in the Old Testament, saw
[42:04] the God he met there was the God who met
[42:07] Moses and Enoch and Noah and Elijah and
[42:09] all the prophets down through the ages.
[42:11] That great Jehovah God revealed himself.
[42:13] And then he began to realize, I'm a
[42:15] child of God more than of the lineage of
[42:18] Abraham, but I'm a child of God. And
[42:20] then so he could look at all the
[42:21] afflictions that he suffered of being of
[42:23] being misunderstood and chased from city
[42:25] to city and stoned and beaten and thrown
[42:28] in jail and robbed and shipwrecked and
[42:30] all these things. He says it is but a
[42:32] light affliction.
[42:34] And he can look back at all those things
[42:35] and say those things did not ruin me.
[42:37] They made me. I mean they developed me.
[42:40] Amen. They are working for me. I mean
[42:42] they were they were on my team.
[42:45] Really? Yeah. Workketh for us. not
[42:50] workketh against us. So you got to take
[42:51] a big picture perspective. All these
[42:54] things are to develop us. Amen. And to
[42:57] to mature us. Amen. Because remember
[43:00] character
[43:02] power without character is satanic.
[43:05] Power with character is fit to rule.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you look at all the you look
[43:10] at David. He had character that was fit
[43:14] to rule.
[43:15] Saul was a light affliction for him. All
[43:18] the trouble he went through, they were
[43:20] light afflictions working for him. What
[43:22] was that to do? To develop his character
[43:24] that he would trust in God and not in
[43:26] the arms of men. That he would trust in
[43:28] God and not his own ability. He would
[43:31] trust in God and not in not in anything
[43:33] around him. He would he would solely
[43:34] rest on the fact I was anointed by God.
[43:38] And it wasn't a temporary thing. It was
[43:40] an identification that I am king.
[43:42] Remember before Samuel ever came to
[43:44] Jesse's house, before God ever told
[43:45] Samuel to go to Jesse's house, David was
[43:48] king. But that seed had to come to life.
[43:50] Amen. That kingship was dormant, but it
[43:52] had to come to life. Surely it, you
[43:54] know, you know, it came to manifestation
[43:56] in small measures like he was the king
[43:58] over his sheep. But God was using that
[44:00] stage of his life. And then finally, the
[44:03] anointing came upon him. And the word
[44:04] said the spirit of God was with him from
[44:06] that day on. And then he begin to God be
[44:08] to show him, I'm going to show you
[44:09] you've got dominion. That's why the
[44:12] first big enemy that's recorded he came
[44:14] against was against Goliath. The biggest
[44:16] Philistine, not a little bitty
[44:18] Philistine, just a raw recruit, some
[44:20] young young fellow who had never fought
[44:22] a battle before, but a warrior from his
[44:24] youth. Cuz God wanted to show him, look,
[44:27] you have dominion over the biggest
[44:28] enemy, physical enemy that is
[44:30] imaginable. Amen. And you're not even
[44:32] going to use a sword or a spear or the
[44:34] weapons of war. You're going to use a
[44:35] slingshot to take down this big giant.
[44:38] Amen. TO PROVE TO YOU, AMEN. THAT MY
[44:41] anointing Amen. that you're an overcomer
[44:43] and you're a king.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why our battles
[44:48] are big.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; That's why our battles are big cuz God
[44:51] wants to show you you can take down the
[44:53] biggest.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're the the God within you is
[44:58] more than able to have dominion over the
[45:00] biggest because God wants to show you
[45:02] you were born to have dominion.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to show you that you're
[45:06] not here just to be a servant and kicked
[45:08] around. No, we ain't some kicker kicked
[45:10] around group of people. No, we're the
[45:11] bride of Jesus Christ. I mean, we're the
[45:13] sons and daughters of God. Amen. So
[45:16] therefore, therefore, no spirit has a
[45:18] right to rule over us. Not for a second.
[45:21] Amen. No spirit has a right to try and
[45:23] take dominion over you and I. No, it's
[45:25] only the spirit of God that should rule
[45:27] us. Amen. And God wants to show that we
[45:29] have power over every spirit. Now
[45:32] Daniel, sorry this is a bit of family
[45:34] prayer from I think last night. But I
[45:36] just this this I really enjoy.
[45:39] I'm glad they were people. You think of
[45:41] Daniel, think of the believers through
[45:42] the Bible. Even even Paul or Peter would
[45:45] say that, you know, Elijah was of like,
[45:47] you know, man of like passions. So he
[45:50] was like us. Got frustrated, got up,
[45:53] down, troubled, all kinds of things.
[45:56] Even got to a point in his life where he
[45:57] prayed directly against the will of God
[46:00] for his life. He got under the juniper
[46:02] tree says, "God, take my life. I'm not
[46:04] worthy to live anymore. Just just just
[46:06] kill me now, Lord." He had no idea that
[46:08] his end was actually a chariot ride into
[46:11] glory.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; How many times we get to a spot where
[46:14] we're actually without knowing that
[46:16] we're praying contrary to the will of
[46:17] God for our lives because of our
[46:20] emotional, we get overwhelmed, we get
[46:22] troubled, all these things. God doesn't
[46:24] hold that against you. He knows what
[46:26] you're made of.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] And it pleased Darius to set over the
[46:30] kingdom 120 princes who should be over
[46:33] the whole kingdom and over these three
[46:35] presidents of whom Daniel was first that
[46:37] the princes might give accounts unto
[46:39] them and the king should have no damage.
[46:41] Then this Daniel was preferred above the
[46:43] presidents and princes because an
[46:46] excellent spirit was in him and the king
[46:48] thought to set him over the whole realm.
[46:51] So here's Daniel. He's been placed by
[46:53] the king. Now remember he was serving
[46:55] the Babylonians and now this is the me
[46:57] and Persians have come in. He was ruling
[46:59] Babylon. He was helping rule Babylon,
[47:02] right? Even when Nebuchadnezzar was out
[47:04] of his mind, he had a spirit of an ox
[47:06] for seven years and eating grass and all
[47:08] these things. Who was ruling the place?
[47:10] Daniel.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then now the enemy
[47:15] enemy comes and invades Babylon. And
[47:17] Darius just says, "Okay, so you're
[47:19] ruling Babylon now. I'm going to place
[47:20] you over the whole empire basically
[47:22] now." But he had an excellent spirit.
[47:25] Now this excellent spirit, this word
[47:27] excellent, it means a preeminent or
[47:31] surpassing, extreme or extraordinary,
[47:34] exceedingly extremely. So it's a it's a
[47:37] preeminent spirit. Now Daniel wasn't an
[47:40] arrogant guy who walked around and
[47:41] thought that the world owed him
[47:42] everything because he was a believer. He
[47:45] was humble, meek, mild, but he had an
[47:48] excellent spirit. He had one that was
[47:50] preeminent.
[47:52] And to me, what that means is that that
[47:54] he did not let any other because he knew
[47:56] who he was. He knew he was a circumcised
[47:59] son of Abraham that God made a covenant
[48:02] with. It wasn't Daniel and Shadrach,
[48:04] Meshach, and Abedneo giving covenants to
[48:06] God as they walked out of Jerusalem as
[48:08] captives. It was the fact they
[48:09] remembered that the God of our fathers,
[48:12] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he made a
[48:14] covenant with them, and we are of their
[48:17] lineage. We're still his children. And
[48:20] they would have been talking. This is
[48:21] just me. I like to think about it. But
[48:23] they would have been talking being taken
[48:24] to Babylon and they would have been
[48:25] talking, brothers, let's serve God in
[48:29] Babylon.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Can it be done? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S FIND
[48:31] OUT.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO DO IT. LET'S BE REMEMBER, WE'RE
[48:34] CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM. Where we are does
[48:37] not change that we're a child of
[48:38] Abraham. We don't suddenly become not
[48:40] children of Abraham because we cross the
[48:42] river Euphrates or we leave the borders
[48:44] of Israel. No, we're children of a
[48:46] Abraham every everywhere. I think it's a
[48:48] good attitude for Christians to take.
[48:50] I'm going to be a Christian at work. I'm
[48:52] going to be a Christian at school. I'm
[48:53] going to be a Christian at home. I'm
[48:55] going to be a Christian at church. I'm
[48:56] going to be Christian in the mall. I'm
[48:57] going to be a Christian WHERE NO ONE
[48:58] ELSE CAN SEE ME. I'M GOING to be a
[49:00] believer everywhere.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what did he do? He had a he
[49:03] had a preeminent spirit. He did not
[49:05] allow any other spirit to take dominion
[49:08] over him that would because every spirit
[49:12] would try. You think you're coming into
[49:14] the superpower of the world at that
[49:16] time, they've just destroyed your city,
[49:19] you know, and you know there's so if
[49:22] they didn't know who they were, that
[49:24] place would have destroyed them. But
[49:26] because they knew who they were, I mean,
[49:27] they could withstand no matter what the
[49:30] cost, they weren't interested in, well,
[49:32] what's going to happen to us? That's
[49:33] irrelevant. We're children of Abraham.
[49:37] If we live, we live. If we die, we die.
[49:39] We're children of Abraham. That was the
[49:41] attitude of Shadrach, Meshach, and
[49:42] Abednego. They said to the king when,
[49:44] you know, he was telling them to worship
[49:47] the idol. He says, you know, uh, we
[49:49] won't be careful how we're going to
[49:50] answer you. So, basically, we're going
[49:51] to answer you straight, O king. If we
[49:53] burn, we burn. If we don't, God's able
[49:55] to deliver us. But whatever happens, we
[49:57] know who we are.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are not GOING TO WE ARE NOT
[50:01] GOING TO LET OUR human spirits, our
[50:03] spirits come subject to the spirit upon
[50:05] you. Amen. But we are not of this world
[50:07] and we're not bowing to this world. and
[50:09] we're going to stand and doesn't matter
[50:11] what happens to us, we ain't bowing.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; I trust it's the same thing with you and
[50:15] I this tonight. Amen. That we are going
[50:18] to because we all have an excellent
[50:20] spirit.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a preeminent spirit. What
[50:23] is that spirit? The spirit of sunship.
[50:26] Amen. When we know we're sons and
[50:28] daughters of God. Amen. We know that
[50:30] we're not just another human being. You
[50:33] know, we are his offspring.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; What about the person on the street?
[50:37] They can come too. I'm not ruling anyone
[50:40] out, you understand? But we got to but
[50:42] you got to know who you are. I'm not
[50:44] here to be dictated to by fashion or
[50:46] politics or whatever. You know, this is
[50:49] an election year. There's going to be a
[50:50] lot of lolly scramble promises and and
[50:53] and and division and arguments and
[50:55] fussing and fighting. God knows who's
[50:57] going to rule this country.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It's going to work for his ends.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Don't get stressed about it.
[51:04] God's able to do whatever whatever he
[51:06] wants to do, he's going to do it. Amen.
[51:09] And we don't know what this year holds.
[51:10] But I pray that we have such an
[51:12] excellent spirit that if the world falls
[51:14] apart, we don't stop being believers.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if every accusation comes
[51:19] against you, every every reason comes
[51:21] against you, say, "I'm sorry, you've
[51:22] come too late. I've been birthed by the
[51:25] word." Amen. This message has birthed me
[51:27] into the kingdom of God. I know who I
[51:30] am. I know the God I serve. I know he's
[51:32] the God of the Bible. You've come too
[51:34] late.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Because it says in Proverbs, he that
[51:40] hath knowledge spe his words. And a man
[51:43] of understanding is of an excellent
[51:46] spirit. So, revelation gives us
[51:48] understanding. See, revelation gives you
[51:51] the full the big picture perspective.
[51:54] Amen. So, so we can say that we are a
[51:56] people because we're a people of
[51:57] understanding. Not that we humanly
[51:59] learned something, but because God
[52:01] opened our eyes to his word. I mean,
[52:04] he's quickened. He's taken the scripture
[52:05] off the page, tied it together from
[52:08] Genesis to Revelation, showed us who he
[52:10] is and showed us who we are. Cuz
[52:13] remember, if you know who you are, you
[52:15] know what you're not,
[52:17] &gt;&gt; right? It's like it's like Daniel knew
[52:19] who he was. So therefore, he knew he
[52:21] wasn't a compromiser. He knew he wasn't
[52:23] a lukewarm makebeliever. He knew he
[52:25] wasn't an unbeliever. He knew he wasn't
[52:27] a gentile. He knew he wasn't a
[52:29] Babylonian. He knew who he was.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Right? So, if you know you're the bride
[52:33] of Jesus Christ, you know you're not a
[52:36] foolish virgin.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; You know you're not a makebeliever. You
[52:39] know you're not an unbeliever. You know
[52:41] you're not just a churchgoer. You know
[52:42] you're the bride of Jesus Christ. Bone
[52:45] of his blown, flesh of his flesh, life
[52:47] of his life. She is him. Why? Because
[52:50] Christ and the bride become one.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust you know who you are. That
[52:55] means you know who you're not.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Well, what about all the group identity
[52:59] politics going on? Well, I'm not that.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because he's given us an
[53:10] understanding. If God's given you
[53:13] revelation that you're a child of God, I
[53:15] tell you that's enough to shout to the
[53:16] rapture.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can rejoice. Say, "I'm not of
[53:19] this world. I'm going to my real world.
[53:21] I'm just passing through this place.
[53:24] It's a temporary light affliction. I
[53:26] mean, but there's a home in glory
[53:28] waiting for me already. I mean, it's
[53:30] prepared before I even arrive. And God's
[53:32] made everything possible for me to get
[53:34] there. You know, if you got the baptism
[53:36] of the Holy Ghost, the rapture is
[53:37] already within you right now. I mean,
[53:39] you're actually rapture ready right now.
[53:41] And if you have the token of the Holy
[53:42] Ghost, you're ready to leave.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, whoa. What if I don't make it? I've
[53:49] already made it.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I've already made it. Amen. I can't miss
[53:52] this plane.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I can't miss the boat.
[53:56] Amen. Cuz I've got a place on the boat
[53:58] and I've already signed up. Amen.
[54:00] Remember, if you if God has quickened
[54:02] you, you're a son or daughter of God,
[54:04] what's the full perspective? You have an
[54:06] if this body be dissolved. You have an
[54:08] eternal body waiting already in the
[54:10] heavens. Amen. And the reason you
[54:12] believe it here is because you've got
[54:14] that body there. You've got
[54:16] identification before the throne of God,
[54:18] which is that eternal body.
[54:21] Praise the Lord.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That's a big picture perspective. So it
[54:24] doesn't matter what can happen to this
[54:26] guy. I've got a home waiting. Like Jesus
[54:29] would say, don't fear him that can
[54:30] destroy the body. Fear him that can
[54:32] destroy the body and soul in hell.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You see? So why should we fear what
[54:37] could happen to us naturally? We want to
[54:40] love the Lord.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just shared this on on uh
[54:46] Sunday, but I just enjoy this. He says
[54:48] he proves all of his words. All of his
[54:50] words. Just think of it. All of his
[54:51] words. And you were his word and he was
[54:54] the word and you are part of his word.
[54:56] And that's the reason you're sent here
[54:58] to confirm your place in life. Amen.
[55:01] Daniel was sent to Babylon to confirm
[55:04] his place in life. Amen. It was more
[55:06] than just a prince or whatever house he
[55:08] came from in Israel, but that he would
[55:10] have he would he would have such an
[55:12] overcoming testimony. NO SYNAGOGUE, no
[55:15] preaching. Amen. No, no tapes to listen
[55:18] to, no YouTube to stream your favorite
[55:20] preacher, not a bunch of songs you can
[55:22] listen to just to enjoy, you know, godly
[55:24] music. He had nothing. But he knew who
[55:27] he was. And God sent him to Babylon to
[55:30] confirm his place in life, that he would
[55:32] have an excellent spirit, a one of
[55:34] supremacy, a preeminent life. Amen. That
[55:37] nothing in that world could make him
[55:39] bow.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And you're sent here, too.
[55:43] You're sent here too to confirm your
[55:46] place in life. That's more than your
[55:48] job, more than your title, more than or
[55:51] any natural thing. It's actually that
[55:53] you're a son or daughter of God. That's
[55:55] a full perspective.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; You mean I was sent to this like brother
[55:58] Brandon speaks about the old school
[56:00] photography where it's actually a
[56:02] physical film. Who's seen that? Maybe
[56:04] you went to Tapa and seen it. You know,
[56:06] we used to have that before digital
[56:08] cameras were a thing.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[56:12] That's going back a long way. Like
[56:15] before the 2000s. Wow. You know, but but
[56:18] a but a film, you take a photo, then you
[56:20] had to take it to a dark room. Then you
[56:22] had to put it through a series of
[56:23] chemical washes and it just brought out
[56:26] what was imprinted on the film when you
[56:28] took the photo. It was brought through a
[56:30] development process in a dark room. And
[56:33] then all it did was actually reveal what
[56:34] was on the film when the photo was
[56:36] taken. And what did God do before the
[56:38] foundation of the world? took a photo of
[56:40] you at your best.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; That's in your eternal body, by the way.
[56:45] It's not it's not your peak at this in
[56:46] this thing,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; whatever that age was. Some of us peaked
[56:49] latest and whatever, you know. It's not
[56:51] that. It's it's a far better thing,
[56:53] right? But you see, he took a photo of
[56:55] you and then what did he do? He brought
[56:57] that he brought that into this dark room
[57:00] of time to develop what he took a photo
[57:03] of you before the foundation of the
[57:04] world. Because remember, death just
[57:06] changes our dwelling place. It doesn't
[57:08] change who we are. Amen. So if you're a
[57:11] believer here, you're a believer there.
[57:13] Amen. If you love the Lord here, you're
[57:15] going to love him there. Amen. If you've
[57:17] given your life here, well, you've
[57:19] already given it, but you know you know
[57:20] what I mean. You're not going to change
[57:21] over there. You're not going to suddenly
[57:23] wake up in eternity, if I put it that
[57:24] way, and be a different person. You'll
[57:26] be the same person. I mean, you just
[57:28] won't be in this body. I mean, just
[57:30] changing house.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So God has sent us upon
[57:35] into this world to confirm your place in
[57:38] life. Amen. You're not a slave to sin.
[57:41] You're not a slave to this ladyan world.
[57:43] You're not a slave to your family
[57:45] upbringing or family spirits or national
[57:48] spirits. No, it's to confirm that God
[57:50] has broken those things by the new birth
[57:53] out of your life.
[57:55] Praise the Lord. He's going to confirm.
[57:57] He's confirming it. That's why you can
[57:59] look back and see testimonies of what
[58:00] God's done. What's God been doing?
[58:03] Confirming your place in life. You
[58:05] didn't belong in the world.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; That's not your place in life. You
[58:09] didn't even belong just going to church.
[58:11] That's not your place in life. Just I'm
[58:13] in the message. It's far more than that.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; It's the God of the message. The Lord
[58:19] Jesus Christ who made all things reveals
[58:21] himself personally to you. And the
[58:24] lights go on. Your eyes come open. And
[58:26] you see more than just a group of
[58:28] doctrines. You see a person. You see
[58:30] Jesus Christ alive. You see him prove
[58:32] his word in your life. You see the
[58:34] spirit of truth which is him come and
[58:36] illuminate the scripture.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; And what's he doing? He's confirming
[58:41] you're my child.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; He knows that. He wants you to know
[58:45] that.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[58:53] Jesus uh we read this in perfect faith.
[58:55] Now notice where he said to us. I won't
[58:57] be much longer. He says, "If you abide
[58:59] in me and my word in you," John 15. "If
[59:01] you abide in me, see, have faith in him.
[59:04] You abide in me and my words abide in
[59:05] you, then ask what you will." Now, see,
[59:08] he knew who he was. Therefore, he had
[59:10] faith. Faith could produce when he
[59:13] knowed what he was.
[59:15] Do you know who you are tonight? It
[59:18] gives you a faith that you're not just
[59:20] haphazardly here. Well, I think I'm a
[59:22] Christian or I pray you're not like
[59:24] this, but you know you're a believer.
[59:26] You know God's done a work in your life.
[59:29] You know that he died on Calvary for
[59:30] you. Amen. And therefore, you know
[59:32] you're a son or daughter of God. That
[59:34] produces a faith in your life. That you
[59:36] can walk by that faith. That if things
[59:39] come into your life which are very
[59:41] misunderstood things like a curveball,
[59:43] unexpected things and having trials
[59:44] suddenly drop into your life. You're not
[59:47] doubting does Jesus love me or not.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; You know he loves you. I mean you know
[59:52] he's proven his love that day on
[59:53] Calvary. know he's he's predestinated
[59:56] you. Amen. So, because you know you're
[59:58] his child, then you know you can never
[1:00:00] be lost and that nothing the devil can
[1:00:02] do in time can change what God did in
[1:00:05] eternity when he wrote your name on the
[1:00:06] last book of life. Right? So, so it
[1:00:09] produces a faith. I mean that God can do
[1:00:12] anything. He can do an instant miracle.
[1:00:15] If not, it's okay.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean faith workketh patience,
[1:00:22] right? So we can wait on the Lord.
[1:00:24] However, he wants to prove his word.
[1:00:26] Praise the Lord. I'm happy with it.
[1:00:29] Amen. It's all light afflictions,
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; right? So it produces a faith and faith
[1:00:35] could produce when he know what he was.
[1:00:36] He says, "Now if you abide in me, my
[1:00:38] word in you, then you know who you are.
[1:00:40] Ask what you will and it'll be given
[1:00:42] you." See, you have a a producers of
[1:00:44] faith. Lord, I'm your child. Your blood
[1:00:47] has destroyed any gap between you and I.
[1:00:50] broke broke down that middle wall of
[1:00:52] partition. Abolish the chasm. Now it's
[1:00:55] you and God are one unit. The blood puts
[1:00:57] you on speaking terms. Amen. And that
[1:00:59] and that transcends how you're feeling,
[1:01:02] what you're going through, how happy you
[1:01:04] are, how many mind battles you have or
[1:01:06] don't have. It transcends all that.
[1:01:08] You're on speaking terms with God. Amen.
[1:01:10] And what does it do? You have faith now.
[1:01:12] Lord, you heard my prayer the first
[1:01:13] time. You'll hear this one, too. Amen. I
[1:01:16] believed your word back there. I still
[1:01:18] believe it. And actually, you've given
[1:01:20] me more faith since I first believed.
[1:01:22] You've matured my faith. It's expanded
[1:01:24] in my life. Things don't toss me to and
[1:01:26] fro like they used to. What's happened?
[1:01:28] Faith has taken a greater preminence in
[1:01:30] your life. We have a greater stability,
[1:01:32] a greater trust, a greater rest. Amen.
[1:01:34] You're not trying to work things out or
[1:01:36] reason things. You just believe God.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you can be like that?
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Well, how's he going to do it? That's
[1:01:43] his business. I just praise him. He's
[1:01:44] going to do something. Amen. I don't
[1:01:46] come to him with a pre-existing
[1:01:48] condition. Lord, you got to do it this
[1:01:50] way. I just commit it to him and God
[1:01:52] does what he wants to do in his time.
[1:01:55] Praise the Lord. Amen. It gives us it
[1:01:58] actually gives us a perfect faith that
[1:02:01] it's that it's a faith which is only
[1:02:03] believe all things are possible. So it's
[1:02:05] not faith and understanding or faith and
[1:02:08] reasoning or faith and working it out or
[1:02:11] faith and human works. It's just faith.
[1:02:14] It's just revelation.
[1:02:17] Brother Bram says here, he says, "Now,
[1:02:19] wouldn't it wouldn't that be wonderful
[1:02:21] tonight if everyone can come in that
[1:02:23] prayer line say I'm a Christian? I have
[1:02:25] no condemnation. I know that my heart
[1:02:27] condemned me not. Something tells me
[1:02:29] that tonight's the end of my suffering."
[1:02:32] Wouldn't it be great if we had come
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; to him? There's nothing between my soul
[1:02:37] and my savior. He's eradicated them all.
[1:02:40] He's taken it all away. I've confessed
[1:02:42] my sins. It's all under the blood.
[1:02:44] There's nothing between me and him. And
[1:02:47] something's telling me that tonight is
[1:02:49] the end of my suffering. There's,
[1:02:51] remember, there's an end to suffering.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; There's an end to it.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Either either by God doing something
[1:02:56] here, he just he just takes us home.
[1:02:58] There's an end to suffering then. But
[1:03:00] there's an end to all suffering. Amen.
[1:03:02] We do not have to let those things rule
[1:03:04] our lives. There's people in this
[1:03:06] building tonight who are suffering, but
[1:03:08] yet victorious. Amen. That tells me
[1:03:11] faith is ruling. Faith has dominance.
[1:03:15] Amen. Their their spirit is an excellent
[1:03:17] spirit. Though they may be hurting,
[1:03:18] going through great things, but faith
[1:03:21] has preeminence.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why does it show that it's not the
[1:03:24] human element that rules? It's actually
[1:03:26] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] Amen. What you going to do? You'll go
[1:03:33] away with something. No matter how much
[1:03:35] you come in with um how much you come in
[1:03:37] emotion, how much you do, it won't work
[1:03:39] until perfect faith has manifested and
[1:03:41] identified itself in you as a substance.
[1:03:43] And when it's there, then nothing's
[1:03:45] going to shake it from you. What it's a
[1:03:46] it's a revelation anchors into your
[1:03:48] heart. I mean, nothing can shake you
[1:03:50] from that.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see, we need to
[1:03:54] rest in the Lord. I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:03:56] kind of do a bit of a segue thing like
[1:03:57] this, okay? But we need to rest in the
[1:03:59] Lord because the big picture tells us
[1:04:03] all is well.
[1:04:05] It's like the Shudomite woman, her son
[1:04:08] was dead. She got to the prophet and
[1:04:10] said all is well.
[1:04:12] Amen. Because she had perfect faith that
[1:04:15] God heard that man's prayers and God
[1:04:17] gave gave the son. Then God can raise
[1:04:20] the son.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. like Abraham, you know, God just
[1:04:24] told Abraham, "Go take take Isaac, your
[1:04:27] only son, and go sacrifice him on the
[1:04:29] mountain. I'll show you." And Abraham
[1:04:32] tells the men that they're journeying
[1:04:33] with, they just the men come part of the
[1:04:35] way and and and he tells the men, "Stay
[1:04:38] here. I and the lad go and worship and
[1:04:40] we'll come back." So Abraham had a
[1:04:43] revelation. I'm going with the promised
[1:04:45] son. I'm going to bring him back even
[1:04:46] though God tells me to sacrifice him.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; That's incredible to me. Amen. because
[1:04:52] it was more than just a
[1:04:55] He knew something was going to happen.
[1:04:59] Praise the Lord. Now, I'm sorry. I'm
[1:05:01] kind of see see but he had perfect he
[1:05:03] was resting in the Lord's ability.
[1:05:05] Amen. That God was going to if God take
[1:05:07] his life, God can restore his life. And
[1:05:10] the big picture says all is well.
[1:05:11] Because remember, God told Abraham
[1:05:13] through Isaac, you're going to have
[1:05:15] many, many children. This is the
[1:05:18] promised seed. So, he saw the big
[1:05:20] picture. So whatever was going to happen
[1:05:21] between Isaac killed or not, whatever
[1:05:24] burnt up in ashes or not, God was going
[1:05:26] to just say if he actually did kill
[1:05:28] Isaac and he was burnt up on the altar,
[1:05:30] then God was going to bring him back
[1:05:32] because through him was going to come
[1:05:34] all of these children, right? So the
[1:05:36] Abraham saw the big picture. He wasn't
[1:05:38] looking at just the then and the well
[1:05:39] we're going up the mountain. This is it.
[1:05:41] No, he saw the big picture. Whatever
[1:05:43] happens in this incident is not going to
[1:05:45] change the end result. Are you following
[1:05:47] me? It's the same thing in our lives.
[1:05:49] sink can seem impossible and crazy just
[1:05:51] naturally, but that's not the end
[1:05:53] result. The big picture can look beyond
[1:05:54] those circumstance, say, "No, God's more
[1:05:57] than able. This is the promise of the
[1:05:59] end. I'm going to rest in that." Praise
[1:06:01] the Lord.
[1:06:04] Amen. He says, "See, we have, if you
[1:06:08] look at the big picture,
[1:06:10] we have more authority in heaven than an
[1:06:12] archangel who never fell
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; because we're his children. They're
[1:06:17] servants. They can never become heirs of
[1:06:20] the kingdom. They are not his. Amen. No
[1:06:23] angel can be a child of God because they
[1:06:26] weren't made thus. They're not part of
[1:06:28] him. They're created beings to serve
[1:06:30] him, but they're not his children. It's
[1:06:32] like if I hired some servants, they can
[1:06:35] never be my children.
[1:06:37] My DNA is not in them.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter if I brought
[1:06:41] them up from a baby and I actually
[1:06:43] adopted them in. They could never be
[1:06:45] full-blood children because they're not
[1:06:47] mine biologically. Are you with me?
[1:06:49] Amen. My my human spirit is not in them.
[1:06:52] My DNA is not in them. They don't look
[1:06:55] like me. They don't act quite like me
[1:06:57] because they have different ch uh
[1:06:58] parents, right? And the angels were
[1:07:00] created by God, but they weren't made as
[1:07:02] his children. They're just made
[1:07:03] servants, right? But we are God's
[1:07:06] children.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He we are the ones he's looking
[1:07:10] for. We are the ones he's interested in.
[1:07:13] Amen. And so that's why who has more
[1:07:16] power with God? Who has the most power
[1:07:19] in heaven? A sinner that's been saved by
[1:07:21] grace or an archangel that's standing by
[1:07:22] his right side? It's a sinner that's
[1:07:24] been saved by grace has more authority
[1:07:27] in heaven than the archangel that stood
[1:07:28] by his side without sin because he's a
[1:07:31] son. The son has more authority than a
[1:07:34] servant. Of course. Amen. So the devil,
[1:07:36] as I've said many times, he's a fired
[1:07:39] servant. He is not He is not a All of
[1:07:43] his all him and all the demons under him
[1:07:45] are just servants that got fired. Amen.
[1:07:48] They've lost the they got kicked out of
[1:07:50] the family business. They ne So so they
[1:07:52] have fallen from their position and God
[1:07:55] ain't going to restore them. Amen. But
[1:07:57] we were born fallen and God's determined
[1:07:59] to restore us because we're his
[1:08:01] children. Amen. So therefore, because
[1:08:03] we're God's children, we have more
[1:08:05] authority or power in heaven than Satan
[1:08:07] himself.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; So why should we fear anything when our
[1:08:11] father hears our prayer and he acts
[1:08:13] according to his own will and
[1:08:15] everything's working after the counsel
[1:08:18] of his will. We can rest in everything
[1:08:20] he does. I trust this is coming out
[1:08:23] right. But we have such a faith,
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; God, you made me a child. I'm your
[1:08:27] offspring.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It just kind of anchored to
[1:08:30] me in the song service. I'm your
[1:08:31] offspring God.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; A son can be such a you I'm part of him.
[1:08:36] His life is in me. Say his spiritual DNA
[1:08:39] is in me. Amen. HIS CHARACTER BY THE NEW
[1:08:42] BIRTH is in me. Amen. ALL THERE IS HE'S
[1:08:44] POURED INTO me cuz I'm his child.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm his child, I can never be
[1:08:50] lost. I can go wayward, but he'll deal
[1:08:52] with ME, BUT I CAN NEVER BE LOST.
[1:08:55] And therefore, cuz he has dominion over
[1:08:57] the Satan and all of his imps, I have
[1:09:00] dominion also.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God, according to his perfect
[1:09:03] will, will answer prayer and do what he
[1:09:05] wants to do. But God's going to prove
[1:09:07] his victory through our lives cuz we are
[1:09:08] his children.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we can see the big picture.
[1:09:12] If people get caught up in some
[1:09:13] religious spirit, we can look beyond
[1:09:15] that and we can intercede. We're sons
[1:09:18] and daughters of God. We're
[1:09:19] intercessors. We're priests under the
[1:09:21] most high God. We can intercede on their
[1:09:23] behalf. And God can move that spirit out
[1:09:25] of the way. God can bring deliverance.
[1:09:28] God can bring redemption. God can bring
[1:09:30] salvation. God can bring prodals home.
[1:09:33] Why? Because God hears our prayer cuz
[1:09:35] we're his children.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and if the Lord said, "If your
[1:09:39] fathers give you good gifts being evil,
[1:09:41] how much more your heavenly father? How
[1:09:44] much more the desires of our heart for
[1:09:45] our families?" Amen. For our loved ones.
[1:09:48] AMEN. THAT GOD'S WORD IS AS IT IS it is
[1:09:51] his WILL THAT THEY BE SAVED. ABSOLUTELY.
[1:09:53] HE'S NOT WILLING THAT ANY WOULD PERISH,
[1:09:55] but all would come to repentance. So,
[1:09:57] we're not praying contrary to his
[1:09:58] contrary to his word. I tell you what,
[1:10:00] friends, even even even Cain had a
[1:10:03] chance.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; And if he agreed, he would have been
[1:10:06] saved.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; There's no one that cannot be saved. OH,
[1:10:10] THEY BLASPHE. WHO CARES? I'M NOT LOOKING
[1:10:12] AT THAT.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The Apostle Paul was a blasphemer.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; That was just a temporary problem. cuz
[1:10:23] he was an eternal child of God.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; So, do we see the big picture?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Or we just look, oh, they said this and
[1:10:30] this and this and this and no, no, no.
[1:10:32] Look beyond that.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Look beyond their fault. See their need.
[1:10:36] Look to the end. Look at the promise of
[1:10:38] the word.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, we were God's enemies once.
[1:10:42] That's
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; true.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; We used to wake up every day driven by a
[1:10:45] carnal nature actually led by Satan
[1:10:47] himself, contrary to God. Whether we
[1:10:50] realize it or not, even just a religious
[1:10:51] person is fighting God. But God softened
[1:10:55] our heart, turned us around.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; So if he can do that for you and I, how
[1:10:59] much more how much more anyone else
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; for that matter?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; But you see, if we get all flustered,
[1:11:06] then God can't use you.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Just sit still. He's big enough to tell
[1:11:10] you. And so just keep on speaking terms
[1:11:12] with him, and he will tell you what to
[1:11:14] do when you get there.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What's going to happen,
[1:11:18] Lord, when I get there? I'll tell you,
[1:11:20] but don't get flustered. I don't think
[1:11:23] Daniel was a man who was flustered.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; He was troubled. He had trouble. He had
[1:11:29] problems, but I don't think he got too
[1:11:31] flustered or flustered that God couldn't
[1:11:33] use him.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a man of prayer. He
[1:11:37] kept that connection.
[1:11:38] He kept he kept surrendered to the Lord
[1:11:41] out of love and thanksgiving.
[1:11:43] Hallelujah. Well, I don't know what to
[1:11:46] love the Lord about. Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:47] I'm your child.
[1:11:49] Thank you, Lord. You redeemed me on
[1:11:51] Calvary. Thank you. You've revealed
[1:11:53] yourself to me, Lord. That's enough.
[1:11:55] That's enough to take you here to the
[1:11:56] new heavens and new earth.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] Praise the Lord. It's best. It's best
[1:12:02] just to carry out our commission. Then
[1:12:05] let him tell you uh let him tell us what
[1:12:08] to do when we get there. After we get
[1:12:10] there, don't you think so? Very fine.
[1:12:14] So, don't get flustered. If you get
[1:12:16] flustered, you got to just just take a
[1:12:18] step back and say, "Lord, help me."
[1:12:22] Because the devil wants to make you
[1:12:23] flustered. Remember remember with uh
[1:12:26] Brother Bram and the maniac that came on
[1:12:27] the uh platform in Oregon,
[1:12:30] spat in his face, tried to get him into
[1:12:32] a carnal way boxing, I'll tell you, limb
[1:12:35] from limb and tried to get him out of
[1:12:36] the spirit of God and get him into a
[1:12:38] carnal way to fight. Right? But brother
[1:12:40] Ram didn't get flustered cuz he realized
[1:12:42] actually the one I represent is in me.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He's present and he could see that man.
[1:12:50] He felt sorry for that man. He thought
[1:12:52] he must have a a a family somewhere.
[1:12:56] Look what he's become. He felt sorry for
[1:12:57] him. He didn't he wasn't condescending
[1:12:59] towards him in his attitude. He felt
[1:13:01] sorry cuz he realized that guy was a
[1:13:03] slave to that spirit.
[1:13:06] Can't we be the same way? not
[1:13:09] condescending. See, I don't think Daniel
[1:13:10] was a man who was condescending.
[1:13:12] He was humble, meek, mild,
[1:13:16] gentle.
[1:13:18] So, don't get flustered. Just trust the
[1:13:20] Lord. He'll tell you when you get there.
[1:13:24] Amen. We're just going to finish with
[1:13:25] this.
[1:13:29] Micaiah would
[1:13:32] we all we all know the story of Micaiah.
[1:13:34] I was just looking if I had a photo of
[1:13:35] it, but you know, Jehoshaphat and Ahab
[1:13:38] would be would be joined together to re
[1:13:40] retake Ramoth Gilead from the Syrians.
[1:13:45] And so Jehoshaphat being a godly king
[1:13:48] said to said to Ahab, "Well, you know,
[1:13:50] we got some prophets and let's let's
[1:13:52] hear what they say. Let's hear what God
[1:13:54] will say." So all 400 of those prophets,
[1:13:56] they got excited and they were they were
[1:13:58] prophesying. And the leader of the
[1:14:00] organization made some uh horns and
[1:14:02] said, "By these you'll push out the
[1:14:04] Assyrians out of the country." And
[1:14:06] Jehoshaphat said, "Well, that's all very
[1:14:08] well, but have you got one more
[1:14:09] prophet?" And then Ahab probably would
[1:14:12] have looked like probably paused and
[1:14:13] maybe looked at him sideways saying,
[1:14:15] "You know, but there's 400 here. Why do
[1:14:17] you want another one?" And he says,
[1:14:18] "Well, I do have one, but he hates me.
[1:14:20] He always prophesies evil against me."
[1:14:21] And Jehoshaphat said to Ahab, "Oh, don't
[1:14:23] let the king say so. Just just just go
[1:14:25] get him." Okay. And then so as um the
[1:14:29] messengers now went to go get Micaiah
[1:14:32] and then the messenger began to tell
[1:14:34] Micaiah the the testimonies coming out
[1:14:36] of the ministerial meetings they just
[1:14:39] had in front of the king and how
[1:14:40] everyone was caught up and excited and
[1:14:42] said what the prophets prophesied and
[1:14:44] all these things. Listen, see what's
[1:14:46] happening now is is is there is a a
[1:14:50] people who are only seeing a small part
[1:14:51] of the picture. These prophets were
[1:14:54] seeing just a small part of the picture.
[1:14:56] But Micaiah was told, you just you just
[1:14:59] say what they say and then you can come
[1:15:01] back and we'll have fellowship and it'll
[1:15:02] be good. But Micaiah said, as the Lord
[1:15:04] liveth, what the Lord saith unto me,
[1:15:06] that will I speak. So here was a man who
[1:15:09] could who wasn't willing just to look at
[1:15:11] the small part of the picture. You want
[1:15:12] to look at the big picture. And then so
[1:15:16] he told he told uh Ahab
[1:15:20] he went there and and and um you know
[1:15:22] Micaiah said, "Ahab, go and you'll
[1:15:24] conquer." Like real real sarcastic. And
[1:15:27] then and then Ahab said to him, I mean
[1:15:29] said to Jehoshaphat, "Don't you see this
[1:15:30] guy always prophesied evil against me?"
[1:15:32] And then Micaiah said, "I saw Israel
[1:15:35] scattered like sheep with no shepherd."
[1:15:38] And then so and then and then um Ahab
[1:15:43] said to him, "Listen,
[1:15:45] put him in the end of prison. Feed him
[1:15:47] the water of sorrow and bread of sorrow
[1:15:49] till I return or bread of affliction."
[1:15:51] Verse 27. And Micaiah said, "If thou
[1:15:54] return at all in peace, the Lord has not
[1:15:56] spoken by me." He said, "Hearken, O
[1:15:58] people, every one of you." So he he said
[1:16:00] basically that you're going to die in
[1:16:02] this battle, Ahab. And but but how would
[1:16:05] he how would he come to this conclusion?
[1:16:08] because because the meeting was 400
[1:16:10] prophets all caught up very charismatic
[1:16:13] move and prophesying all these things
[1:16:16] but you see Micaiah wasn't interested in
[1:16:20] what he saw the expression he wanted to
[1:16:23] look at the big picture and the only way
[1:16:26] that he could see the big picture was
[1:16:27] take take what he saw and what was going
[1:16:30] on back to the prophecy of the word and
[1:16:33] so Micaiah would studied the message
[1:16:35] books of Elijah
[1:16:37] And Elijah said the dogs would lick
[1:16:39] Ahab's blood. Right? So he realized
[1:16:42] actually this whole thing because what
[1:16:44] they were saying the 400 prophets were
[1:16:46] prophesying contrary to the word of
[1:16:48] Elijah. So Micaiah he he actually saw no
[1:16:52] the bigger picture is God is allowing
[1:16:54] all these things to happen because
[1:16:56] there's some dogs that are going to lick
[1:16:57] Ahab's blood. He's going to die. And so
[1:17:03] Micaiah took the vision he saw which was
[1:17:05] he saw a lying spirit come out of hell
[1:17:07] go up to heaven where they're having a
[1:17:09] meeting saying how can we get Ahab to
[1:17:11] fall in battle to fulfill the words of
[1:17:13] Elijah. And the lying spirit said I'll
[1:17:15] get into those prophets cuz they'll just
[1:17:17] fall for whatever I say cuz they don't
[1:17:19] have the big picture. They don't have
[1:17:21] the word. Amen. And then and then
[1:17:23] Micaiah said this is what happened. And
[1:17:25] of course you know the rest of the
[1:17:26] story. Ahab and that Jehoshaphat go and
[1:17:29] fight. Ahab gets struck by an arrow,
[1:17:31] stays in his chariot. They can't get out
[1:17:32] of the battle. He bleeds to death in the
[1:17:34] chariot and he's buried in whatever
[1:17:36] sephiler and dogs come and lick the
[1:17:38] blood off the chariot. But you see what
[1:17:41] did Micaiah do? He had the big picture
[1:17:44] perspective because he compared his
[1:17:46] vision with the word.
[1:17:49] I trust we do the same thing.
[1:17:52] Doesn't matter how emotional it may
[1:17:54] seem, how great things may seem. Can we
[1:17:56] take everything back to the word?
[1:17:59] Because if you got a big picture
[1:18:01] perspective, you will take everything
[1:18:03] back to the prophecy.
[1:18:07] So this is in summary. Now let's have
[1:18:09] the musicians please tonight.
[1:18:12] Are you looking at the big picture as
[1:18:13] you work through uh walk
[1:18:16] through? It should be life, not like so
[1:18:18] I can't spell. But are you are you
[1:18:21] looking at the big picture? What is the
[1:18:22] big picture perspective? The word that's
[1:18:24] revealed.
[1:18:26] Are you are you looking at that as you
[1:18:27] walk through life? Do you see where you
[1:18:30] come from and where you're going?
[1:18:34] Do you see that? I come from God and
[1:18:36] going back to God.
[1:18:38] Do you see situations through the lens
[1:18:40] of you being a son or daughter of God?
[1:18:43] See, if you see things through that
[1:18:44] lens, you realize all things work
[1:18:46] together for good because I love the
[1:18:48] Lord. I'm called according to his
[1:18:49] purpose. Amen. that everything is is
[1:18:53] going to develop me and my character to
[1:18:56] be more like his character
[1:18:59] or you just get frustrated and and
[1:19:01] question and get angry at God or do you
[1:19:03] see the big picture?
[1:19:05] I trust you see the big picture.
[1:19:07] Everything happens for us. Everything
[1:19:09] happens to us for a reason, for a
[1:19:12] purpose. And God is interested in
[1:19:15] character.
[1:19:17] That's why he's developing us in this
[1:19:19] time.
[1:19:21] Okay.
[1:19:22] So, never don't think, well, God's
[1:19:24] forsaken you. He's angry at you. No, no.
[1:19:27] He's developing character.
[1:19:30] That's what he's interested because the
[1:19:31] only thing we can take with us is our
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; character,
[1:19:36] right? So, praise the Lord. I trust we
[1:19:39] see the big picture.
[1:19:41] Amen. As you could maybe ponder on those
[1:19:45] three words, where were you? As God
[1:19:48] would ask Job, where were you?
[1:19:50] Where was I before the foundation of the
[1:19:51] world?
[1:19:54] I was shouting for joy.
[1:19:58] All the sons of God I'm sorry I'm just
[1:20:00] I'm finished. I'm just going to enjoy
[1:20:02] myself for a few minutes. All the sons
[1:20:04] of God were shouting. We were shouting.
[1:20:06] We're in God's mind and he saw us. He
[1:20:09] took a photo of us. Remember that. And
[1:20:11] and that photo is more than just a
[1:20:13] image.
[1:20:16] It's more than just an image. It's our
[1:20:18] character, our nature, how we respond,
[1:20:20] our attitude. It's us as an entire
[1:20:23] person. And he saw us shouting and
[1:20:26] rejoicing. And he knew what's eternal
[1:20:28] stays that way. We may take this bypass
[1:20:31] through time, come into this veil of
[1:20:33] humiliation to be tested, tried, and
[1:20:35] molded and shaped. But we're coming out
[1:20:37] the other side shouting.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we're not just
[1:20:41] shouting when the when the foundation
[1:20:44] stones are being placed in all these
[1:20:45] things. We'll be shouting around the
[1:20:47] throne. New heavens and new earth. New
[1:20:50] Jerusalem redeemed. Eternity rolls on.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's um let's stand, shall we?
[1:20:58] Tonight. Sorry, I've kept you, but uh I

[1:21:37] Before the world began, you knew my
[1:21:40] name. You held me in your hand.
[1:21:46] When the earth was silent, I was there
[1:21:50] with you singing your praise.
[1:21:55] And I came to the earth.
[1:22:00] I took my first breath
[1:22:05] and the cry I made was singing your

[1:23:20] every low.
[1:23:24] And you started to call me
[1:23:29] from eternity.

[1:23:45] I have a reason to praise you.
[1:23:49] I have a reason to lift up my hands and
[1:23:53] rejoice. I have a reason to sing.
[1:23:58] When I was lost in the darkness,
[1:24:03] you came to find me.
[1:24:08] I heard you calling my name. Took my sin
[1:24:12] and my shame and you saved me.
[1:24:17] Now I can call you my savior.
[1:24:22] I can call you redeemer.
[1:24:26] I can call you my healer, my father, my
[1:24:30] friend. I can call you my king.

[1:24:47] Hosan.
[1:24:49] I was lost. Now I am saved.

[1:25:26] rejoice. I have a reason to sing.
[1:25:31] When I was lost in the darkness,
[1:25:36] you came to find me.
[1:25:41] I heard you calling my name to my sin
[1:25:45] and my shame and you save me.
[1:25:50] Now I can call you my savior.
[1:25:55] I can call you redeemer.
[1:26:00] I can call you my healer, my father, my
[1:26:03] friend. I can call you my king.

[1:26:13] friend. I can call you my king.

[1:27:05] Some call me weak because I say that I'm

[1:31:37] may we always take everything back to

[1:31:58] continue to reveal to us who we are in
[1:32:00] you as your sons and daughters, your
[1:32:02] offspring. Father, may you bless each
[1:32:05] one here, dear God. And I pray, Father,
[1:32:07] that Lord, may we not look at things
[1:32:09] through our what our emotions or our
[1:32:12] reasoning or our conscience or our
[1:32:14] imaginations tell us, what we see with
[1:32:15] our eyes or hear with our ears, but may
[1:32:18] we look at everything, Lord, in the big
[1:32:19] picture perspective based on your word.
[1:32:22] Granted, dear God, I pray you'd dismiss
[1:32:24] us with your blessings now. We thank
[1:32:26] you, Lord, for this time in Jesus
[1:32:28] Christ's name. Amen.
