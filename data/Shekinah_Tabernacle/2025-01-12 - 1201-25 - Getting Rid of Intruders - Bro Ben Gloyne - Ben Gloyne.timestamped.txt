[3:21] Bruce when he walked in and I thought
[3:22] one day I'm going to ask him up to pray
[3:24] and he's going to say yes but not this
[3:26] morning but one day
[3:30] you know as Christians we speak things
[3:32] out by faith and then when we speak them
[3:35] out they become a
[3:38] reality I just spoke it out a a and and
[3:42] you can all watch it unfold and become a
[3:44] reality CU and when you comes up you'll
[3:46] remember oh that's right brother Isaac

[3:53] inspiration you know in the Lord we're
[3:55] always growing it's never like it's
[3:56] never stagnant it's never like he's
[3:59] never finished with us he's always doing
[4:00] something in our life he's always

[36:19] to we're going to go to 2 Corinthians
[36:21] chapter 10 you know it was interesting
[36:23] uh before Wednesday I was I was found
[36:25] myself looking at uh the greatest badly
[36:27] ever for and the conscience and
[36:29] different things I'm thinking why am I
[36:31] why am I looking at these things and
[36:33] then and then brother Jimmy stands up
[36:34] here and talks about Intruders and I
[36:37] thought praise the Lord I'm going to
[36:39] step in right behind what he has
[36:41] preached and I'm going to talk about
[36:42] getting rid of The
[36:43] Intruders amen because a lot of the time
[36:46] me sometimes we think of intruders as a
[36:49] a bad habit the world's G or something
[36:51] but no there's the greatest battle in
[36:52] here there Intruders get in here was try
[36:55] and stop God's word manifesting in our
[36:58] lives and those are the most subtle
[37:00] Intruders so we're going to have an
[37:01] intruder
[37:03] extermination amen today hallelujah
[37:06] praise the Lord so let's um sorry is
[37:09] that is that wait oh yeah one day I'll
[37:13] streamline this one day I'll get there
[37:14] amen Let's uh so 2 Corinthians chapter
[37:16] 10 verses 3 down to verse 5 then then as
[37:19] a context we're going to go to Mark
[37:21] chapter uh five here it says here for we
[37:24] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[37:26] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[37:28] of our Warfare not carnal But Mighty
[37:30] through God to the pulling down of
[37:32] strongholds casting down imaginations
[37:35] and every High thing that exalteth
[37:36] itself against the knowledge of God and
[37:39] bringing into captivity every thought to
[37:41] The Obedience of Christ you've got a job
[37:44] to do amen take every thought bring it
[37:48] obedience to the to the to The Obedience
[37:50] of Christ to the word of God Amen so now
[37:52] we're going to turn to chap uh Mark
[37:54] chapter 5 and this is this is a very
[37:56] familiar story to us all it's where um
[38:01] Jas is uh you know his his daughter's
[38:03] sick he's um he's come to get Jesus
[38:05] they're on their way then then um then
[38:08] uh Jas gets word that his daughter is
[38:10] not uh has has died but then Jesus here
[38:13] well so that's the background to this so
[38:15] here we are and Jesus immediately
[38:17] knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[38:18] out of him the woman with the blood
[38:20] issue touches His Garment as he's on the
[38:21] way to D's house he turned about in the
[38:24] press and said who touched my clothes
[38:26] and his disciples said unto him thou
[38:28] seeth the multitude thronging thee and
[38:30] saith thou who touch me and he looked
[38:33] round about to see her that had done
[38:35] this thing but the woman fearing and
[38:37] trembling knowing uh what was done in
[38:40] her came and fell down before him and
[38:42] told him all the truth and he said unto
[38:45] her daughter thy faith has made thee
[38:47] whole go in peace and be whole of thy
[38:50] plague while he it spake there came from
[38:53] from the ruler of the synagogue's house
[38:55] uh certain which said thy daughter da is
[38:57] dead why troubles thou the master any
[39:00] further and as soon as Jesus heard the
[39:02] word that was spoken he saith unto the
[39:04] ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid
[39:07] only
[39:09] believe amen Let's uh pray this morning
[39:12] if you have a need you just want to slip
[39:13] your hand up to the Lord and say Lord
[39:15] speak to my life Lord I'm here to
[39:17] worship you and touch my life oh God

[40:16] commit the service into your hands and
[40:18] thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[40:20] amen amen you can have your seats this
[40:22] morning so as I said about so we're
[40:24] going to talk about uh getting rid of
[40:26] intruders now Jesus would um as as Paul
[40:30] would say that the weapons of a Warfare
[40:32] are not carnal but uh But Mighty through
[40:34] God to the pulling down of strongholds
[40:36] now brother Bram when he preaches the
[40:38] greatest battle ever fought he says that
[40:39] greatest battle is in the mind today and
[40:42] it's on every man woman and child this
[40:44] battle comes comes your way but we have
[40:48] we have overcoming power in this battle
[40:50] now uh if you have uh this battle is
[40:53] irrespective of if you're a Christian
[40:55] not a Christian feeling victory not
[40:57] feeling Victory doesn't matter what
[40:58] state you're in you're going to have
[41:00] this battle but brother Bram would say
[41:02] in Satan's Eden and and and to me I you
[41:04] I like this where he says now I wanted
[41:06] to speak to you something to bring
[41:07] something to Enlighten you uh to the uh
[41:10] Enlighten to you the promise of God for
[41:12] this AGC something not something that
[41:14] somebody else was in some other
[41:16] day but something them things are all
[41:19] right but we all refer to those things
[41:20] but I thought I would try uh to bring
[41:23] something to your mind with these
[41:25] scriptures I got written down here that
[41:26] would enlighten you to know to make you
[41:28] a better soldier in the field that
[41:30] you're fighting in now to learn the
[41:33] tactics of the enemy now we're all in
[41:36] different fields really based on the
[41:38] stage of life you know if if if you're
[41:41] not a parent you're not fighting in the
[41:42] field of being a parent right if you're
[41:45] you know if you're um if you're at
[41:47] school you're not fighting in the field
[41:49] of uh the workforce or if you're retired
[41:52] you're not fighting in the field of all
[41:54] those previous things exactly so we're
[41:56] all in different kind of fields so the
[41:58] devil but but the devil uses the same
[42:00] tactics in those fields now we want to
[42:02] we want to learn the tactics of the
[42:04] enemy right because we need to see how
[42:07] he comes in and then how so these
[42:09] Intruders how they get in now I'm not
[42:11] going to repeat uh repeat Brother
[42:14] Jimmy's um sermon to me that was
[42:15] phenomenal and if you haven't heard it
[42:17] you should go hear that but you see now
[42:19] there's different there's different
[42:21] inlets into the body uh into the body
[42:24] and into the spirit realm and there's
[42:26] faith and doubt which is into the soul
[42:28] now Intruders want to get in and affect
[42:31] these Realms to hinder the work of God
[42:34] in our lives right this is the remember
[42:36] the devil's job is to withstand and try
[42:38] and stop God's word being fulfilled
[42:40] right he's the accuser of the Brethren
[42:42] but his main his main role is to try and
[42:45] stop the word of God being fulfilled
[42:46] because he wants to he wants to usurp
[42:48] the word of God and take control but God
[42:51] is here that that ain't going to happen
[42:54] right he will try but we know who comes
[42:56] out Victorious in the end right so now
[42:58] so these Intruders will try and get in
[43:00] because brother Braham says that the
[43:02] that the word of God must be first
[43:04] received in the mind in the spirit right
[43:06] and then it goes down into the soul then
[43:08] it takes over and does what it wants to
[43:10] do and that's with every every Divine
[43:12] promise of God we we got to realize that
[43:14] I'm sure we're all very aware of the
[43:15] fact that just because we're born again
[43:17] doesn't mean the battle stops you know
[43:19] just because we the Lord Med us and
[43:21] we've sealed to the day of our
[43:22] Redemption doesn't mean the battle stops
[43:24] one bit no it actually gets stronger but
[43:26] we got to realize that there's a soldier
[43:27] on the battlefield of the Holy Ghost
[43:29] which is mightier and greater than the
[43:31] enemy and all he can do cuz the devil's
[43:34] been defeated right but the devil will
[43:36] try and get in he knows how we're built
[43:37] he knows how our our how our emotional
[43:40] realm Works he knows what appeals to us
[43:42] he knows exactly how we're made and he
[43:44] will exploit how we're built for his own
[43:47] devices to stop the word of God coming
[43:50] into manifestation in our lives now but
[43:53] the great thing is is God knows this and
[43:55] God knows the thing that will defeat now
[43:57] I just want to get from the get-go if
[43:59] you see see uh as we identify some
[44:02] Intruders the way to get rid of The
[44:04] Intruders to take God at his word it's
[44:07] very simple right it's very simple you
[44:09] say Lord I believe your word now God
[44:13] wants us to come to a place where we're
[44:15] not leaning on the five senses or
[44:17] anything of this Earth where we're when
[44:19] we're born that's all we know is the
[44:21] five senses right our emotional realm
[44:23] begins to develop then we know those
[44:25] those things right you know affection
[44:27] and reasoning and memory and you know
[44:29] affection is great you know among
[44:31] children I want this I want this I need
[44:33] this you know there's this kind of
[44:34] supercharges their life but there comes
[44:37] a point where these things should become
[44:38] balanced but the only way to truly
[44:40] balance it is when faith comes in the
[44:42] Holy Ghost takes over then all these
[44:44] things can come into the right balance
[44:45] right but you see we have to come to a
[44:48] place like Abraham did where we walk by
[44:50] faith alone right so it's not by
[44:53] reasoning it's not by affections it's
[44:54] not by uh conscience or imagin or memory
[44:57] or what we see feel smell hear whatever
[45:00] touch taste whatever all those things
[45:02] it's not those things it's faith alone
[45:05] now as as um Paul would write about uh
[45:08] Abraham he said and the father of
[45:10] circumcision to them who are not of the
[45:13] circumcision only but all but who also
[45:15] walk in the steps of that Faith of Our
[45:17] Father Abraham which he uh had being yet
[45:21] uncircumcised now Abraham went on a
[45:23] journey he had to leave everything he
[45:25] was used to right as as um and we're
[45:28] going to come back to Jas because Jas
[45:30] had to come to this place too and every
[45:32] every child of Abraham comes to this
[45:34] place of walking by faith alone because
[45:36] we we know the pattern of Abraham's life
[45:39] or or or his his life is a pattern of
[45:41] the Christian walk and I'm not going to
[45:43] go into that particularly this morning
[45:44] but you know you got to realize that we
[45:46] come to a point as I said about a baby
[45:48] they just live on the five senses but
[45:50] then God comes into our life we could be
[45:52] young could be old where we go from
[45:53] those things to walking by faith alone
[45:56] now Abra was commanded by God in Genesis
[45:59] 12 he said get thee out of thy country
[46:01] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[46:03] father's house into a land that I will
[46:05] show thee so God is telling him
[46:07] basically leave everything you're used
[46:09] to leave your upbringing leave how you
[46:12] thought leave your culture leave your
[46:15] family spirit and traits and how you you
[46:18] know leave those things and walk by
[46:20] faith alone this is what he's telling
[46:21] him to do leave leave what you're used
[46:24] to and this is what the Christian
[46:25] Journey's got to be see we used to
[46:27] thinking a different way but then when
[46:29] you meet the Lord and the his word
[46:31] starts having effect in your life you
[46:33] start thinking a different way than how
[46:35] you used to I remember before I met the
[46:37] Lord I was lost in the world I never
[46:39] thought like I do
[46:40] now my thinking has totally changed
[46:43] praise the Lord to that amen I used to
[46:45] think the things of the world but God
[46:47] very rarely came into my thoughts unless
[46:51] I needed something from him amen so I
[46:53] remember when you know there was a when
[46:55] my parents live in American and you a
[46:57] cyclone came through it flattened all
[46:59] the um flattened all the trees where
[47:01] where my parents lived where they lived
[47:03] was like a basically a big lava shelf
[47:05] and it was this much soil and lava rock
[47:07] underneath and blew down all the trees
[47:09] and people lost their houses and things
[47:11] and you know and and and and the morning
[47:13] after we had to get out and and and cut
[47:15] a track through our driveway for my dad
[47:17] had to basically get on his motorbike go
[47:19] see if his work was still there so all
[47:21] the trees fell over us where these
[47:22] machetes and of course the wind still
[47:24] blowing and you know it's one thing to
[47:26] look at it from the inside but then you
[47:28] go into it and you're under all these
[47:30] coconut trees
[47:32] swaying with these big gusts and you're
[47:34] and you're hacking away at these Fallen
[47:35] branches I was thinking about God a lot
[47:37] then I was singing hymns that I sung at
[47:40] Chapel at school and you know but I
[47:42] never thought I never was like that
[47:44] normally but when I needed him I began
[47:46] to think on him right and then when I
[47:47] was at Uni I said Lord I prayed Lord I
[47:49] need a job and I got a job you see but
[47:51] other times I forgot about him and kept
[47:53] doing what I was doing until he got a
[47:55] hold of my life then he changed my
[47:57] thinking you see so you got to look at
[47:59] because an intruder will always try and
[48:01] diminish the word of God he'll try and
[48:03] see this is how you identify a an
[48:05] intruder he will diminish and reason
[48:08] away the effect of the word of God in
[48:09] your life amen what was the first
[48:12] Intruder the serpent got into the garden
[48:14] he was an intruder right and what did he
[48:17] say to Eve ye haath God said and what
[48:19] did he do you'll surely not die you know
[48:22] really really the potency of the word of
[48:24] God Eve is really you actually lifting
[48:27] it up higher than what it really is
[48:28] you'll actually be greater if you do
[48:29] this thing right so so and if an
[48:32] intruder comes in he'll make you think
[48:35] that the word isn't really as powerful
[48:37] and not as powerful For You
[48:39] especially we're identifying some
[48:41] Intruders I trust see this is a mind
[48:43] battle we all come across he comes in he
[48:46] comes out he tries to but but faith has
[48:48] got to be tested see the soldier on the
[48:51] battlefield in here is going to be
[48:53] proven in your life you're going to see
[48:55] as you walk with God that really this
[48:57] Soldier wins he really is
[49:00] Rambo he's a one man Victory amen but
[49:04] but it's got to be proven this is why
[49:06] God allows mind battles not to keep us
[49:08] oh you know you know not to keep us TR
[49:10] Trot and down no God wants to prove the
[49:13] faith he's placed in your life that's
[49:15] what he wants to do right so now praise
[49:19] the Lord and I'm glad for that aren't
[49:20] you you can look back in your life and
[49:22] you can see where God has comeing time
[49:24] and time again he's proven us word he's
[49:27] proven himself you see but the Devil
[49:29] comes in to try and make you think the
[49:31] word of God is Not powerful in your life
[49:34] you know the scripture can break a mind
[49:36] battle like that you know the word of
[49:38] God is is is is supreme power it's
[49:42] supreme power am me when Jesus and and
[49:44] Jesus proved it doesn't matter the
[49:46] condition you feel you're in relative if
[49:48] it'll work or not because when he was in
[49:50] the desert he was head fasted for 40
[49:52] days he was at his weakest point but yet
[49:55] he didn't use his great power now we
[49:57] know the Lord Jesus he supreme power he
[50:00] made the worlds we live in he made the
[50:01] universe he he he's the ultimate There's
[50:04] No One Like Our God but yet when he was
[50:06] at his lowest he wanted to prove to the
[50:08] Christian it's not it's it's not supreme
[50:11] power that you can relying to overcome
[50:13] it is quoting the word of God Amen why
[50:17] because the devil tried to bring an
[50:18] intruder into his reasoning if thou be
[50:20] the Son of God prove this he's trying to
[50:23] see he's trying to put an intruder in
[50:24] there but our lord Jesus don't let an
[50:26] intruder
[50:27] Hallelujah see the see the Mind battle
[50:29] came to him he appealed to his flesh
[50:31] you're hungry you've been fasting for 40
[50:33] days God's LED you out into this
[50:35] condition you know you can turn the
[50:36] picture around but he proved that the
[50:39] weakest of Christians by quoting the
[50:41] word of God will conquer the devil any
[50:44] place any time anywhere am mean so why
[50:47] do we quote our situation why don't we
[50:50] quote the word in our situation and take
[50:53] God at his word no matter what we see
[50:55] taste feel smile hear imagine reason
[50:57] whatever more why don't we just take God
[51:00] at his word because that's what our lord
[51:03] Jesus wants to do because if he did that
[51:05] then he will bring us into scenarios
[51:07] where we'll do the same thing praise the
[51:10] Lord aren't you glad because we're his
[51:12] children aren't we we're Made In His
[51:13] Image I me so what he went through we'll
[51:15] go
[51:16] through praise God maybe not physically
[51:19] crucified but you can be spiritually
[51:20] crucified you can be rejected you can be
[51:22] despised all those things but he wants
[51:24] to prove his faith that is placed in you
[51:27] it
[51:28] works amen but you see an intruder will
[51:32] put reasoning in there will try and
[51:34] reason away the power of the word of
[51:37] God and he will try and use you to
[51:41] diminish the faith that he's placed that
[51:43] God's placed in you because of oh
[51:45] because you say well of course Jesus
[51:47] could quote the word he was the word the
[51:49] word is made flesh
[51:51] today we are his sons and daughters of
[51:53] God are we
[51:54] not amen the Holy Ghost knew was not a
[51:57] less a Holy Ghost and what was in our
[51:58] lord Jesus wasn't a less a holy ghost
[52:00] what was in the prophet you know you see
[52:02] an intruder will come you see just like
[52:05] when Jesus told the story of the rich
[52:06] man in
[52:08] Lazarus the rich man is in hell and he
[52:11] cries out he sees that he he he sees
[52:14] Lazarus the poor man in Abraham's bosom
[52:16] right and then he appeals to Abraham
[52:18] send send Lazarus or send someone to my
[52:21] family who's still alive that they won't
[52:23] come to this place and Abraham says they
[52:26] have the Lord law and the prophets that
[52:27] is enough so Abraham knew the power of
[52:30] the word that they had in that day was
[52:33] was powerful more than enough to take
[52:36] people to go take them into
[52:38] heaven amen so can we not take God at
[52:41] his word that when we come into a mind
[52:43] battle we feel like we're failures we
[52:46] feel like we're far from God we feel
[52:47] like we can't overcome that we can take
[52:49] a scripture and it will break
[52:51] it amen I believe it many times things
[52:55] feel far away from God God's distance
[52:57] somewhere God doesn't care but then the
[52:59] scripture comes to mind I'll never leave
[53:00] thee nor forsake Thee I me it just
[53:02] breaks that whole thing I realize God
[53:03] your word is said that inres of how I
[53:06] feel what I'm going through Thank You
[53:07] Lord because your word is true no matter
[53:10] where I am no matter what's going on
[53:14] hallelujah amen an intruder will get it
[53:16] and and and and because it's just like
[53:18] uh Satan there with with with Jesus in
[53:21] the in the wilderness if thou be do this
[53:24] prove your faith right now
[53:27] but you see someone who doesn't have
[53:29] Intruders isn't looking for how the
[53:31] word's going to be fulfilled the three
[53:33] Hebrew children when they stood before
[53:36] Nebuchadnezzar they weren't you know
[53:38] they didn't say well if God delivers us
[53:40] now then we'll then we're not going to
[53:42] Bow they said we're not we're not going
[53:44] to be careful how we're going to answer
[53:46] you in this matter God can deliver us
[53:48] but if he doesn't we're still not going
[53:50] to Bow if we burn we burn if we don't we
[53:52] don't but we're not going to Bow so what
[53:54] did they do they stood there saying that
[53:56] we will not our worship our life will
[53:58] not change based on what God does our
[54:01] life is based on what he has said
[54:04] Hallelujah I trust that's the same thing
[54:06] with you and I friends see reasoning
[54:08] tries to come and say well if you're
[54:09] really the bride then this will happen
[54:11] if you're really then this will happen
[54:12] you say no I am the bride of Christ
[54:14] because his word says I'm the bride and
[54:16] I serve him because he uh because of who
[54:19] he is not what's going on in my
[54:22] life praise the Lord hallelujah aren't
[54:25] you glad for that I'm talking about the
[54:27] faith that's in you you got a you got a
[54:28] mighty warrior in the side of you I mean
[54:31] inside of you you may feel like a
[54:32] failure but he's never failed amen and
[54:35] he will never
[54:36] fail praise the Lord amen but you see
[54:40] now we've got to we've got to leave
[54:41] everything we knew and we got to walk
[54:44] we're got to walk into a realm of only
[54:46] Bel for all things are possible now you
[54:48] see if we go back to D just quickly I
[54:50] just because I feel like many times I
[54:52] read a scripture I just forget about it
[54:53] so let's just go through this now so Jas
[54:56] was son of Abraham right he was the son
[54:58] of Abraham but God allowed this trouble
[55:00] to come into his life because he wanted
[55:02] him to only Bel right we live in an age
[55:06] where it's it's it's really only believe
[55:09] is a very rare thing now I'm not talking
[55:10] about the song now I'm talking about a
[55:11] faith that's in a people because you you
[55:14] you if we look at the age we live in
[55:16] it's a it's a hybrid age it's a mixing
[55:18] age look at all the food that we eat I
[55:20] doubt any of its original seed it'd be
[55:23] pretty hard to find some Original Seed
[55:25] somewhere it's all all been hybridized
[55:27] it's all been mixed it's not just it's
[55:28] not just what it was in its pure form
[55:30] something's been added to it and Jesus
[55:33] was telling was telling Jas don't add
[55:36] anything just believe it's not it's not
[55:39] believe Plus or believe and feel it
[55:42] therefore it is or believe and imagine
[55:44] it there it is or believe and reason it
[55:46] no it's only belief just take God at his
[55:50] word it's not something mixed with it
[55:52] it's not something taken away from it
[55:53] it's only belief amen so now he had to
[55:56] come to this place cuz if you look at
[55:58] now Jas has this hope in his life he's
[56:01] trying to he's trying now if I go back
[56:04] to
[56:04] this and and and this is natural human
[56:07] being if you've got actually any emotion
[56:09] in you there's a way that emotional
[56:11] feeling Lord you can do it right and and
[56:15] and that's why he went to go get Jesus
[56:17] is because he he he knew that is you
[56:19] know he knew that his uh of course his
[56:21] daughter was sick and God God allowed
[56:24] him to come off the
[56:27] the work of man now if God wants you to
[56:29] go medical he'll Lead You medical that's
[56:30] fine right God said brother BR say It's
[56:33] Our obligation go to the
[56:35] doctor okay well some of you don't well
[56:38] I
[56:39] do amen is that
[56:43] okay does that mean you don't believe no
[56:45] I believe I've seen God heal all manner
[56:48] of things
[56:50] Hallelujah but you see now Jas had to be
[56:53] see what was he leaning on first he's a
[56:56] leader in the synagogue he's a good
[56:58] person the doctors can help this all
[57:00] this can happen God didn't use that
[57:02] Avenue he wanted him to walk like
[57:04] Abraham walked to go off the five senses
[57:06] go off what he can imagine and and
[57:07] hoping to actually have a Rock Solid
[57:10] Faith to only believe hallelujah amen so
[57:14] so so that's why Jesus said to him don't
[57:17] be
[57:18] afraid that's a big Intruder fear is a
[57:22] big Intruder fear is such a crippling
[57:25] thing thing but fear is an intruder and
[57:28] intruders are made to be exterminated
[57:31] they're not to be collected like um
[57:33] Jimmy had that big snake in that place
[57:35] you know that picture of that snake you
[57:36] know I'm sure everyone remembers that
[57:40] yes you see if you feed a snake long
[57:42] enough it'll get that big if it's a
[57:43] python right they just keep growing well
[57:45] I think anyway you see so fear or
[57:48] anything like that when when that little
[57:50] voice comes in and there's a fear of the
[57:53] unknown how's this going to happen
[57:55] what's going to happen to my children
[57:57] what's going to happen in the future the
[57:58] world's falling apart what's going to be
[58:01] you see now that can that can either
[58:03] take you to the Lord in faith because we
[58:06] see because remember in order to walk by
[58:08] faith alone doesn't mean that you're an
[58:10] ostrich and put your head in the sand
[58:12] that's not Faith that's actually just
[58:14] fear we don't walk along with blinkers
[58:16] on we see the trouble we see the
[58:19] condition of the age we see all these
[58:21] things and we see it more than the world
[58:23] does CU we can see it through the lens
[58:24] of the Bible we can see it through the
[58:25] lens into the message right but you see
[58:28] so so walking by faith alone does not
[58:30] mean you just ignore the um you ignore
[58:32] the conditions like ignore what you know
[58:34] what's going on like brother BR would
[58:36] say and how can I overcome he said it's
[58:38] like you know someone's got a Cancer and
[58:41] people say no no no I don't have a
[58:42] cancer he says yeah you got it but you
[58:44] got to realize the one in you has
[58:45] already overcome that cancer amen that's
[58:47] how that's how that that um that intrud
[58:50] doesn't get in and take control of your
[58:52] life is when you realize no the one in
[58:53] me has already conquered this thing am
[58:55] mean the one enemy has already conquered
[58:57] this mind battle he conquered it 2,000
[58:59] years ago and he's still Victorious
[59:01] today so it doesn't matter what fear or
[59:03] whatever comes into my life I'm not
[59:05] going to feed it that it becomes so
[59:07] big amen like you take that snake for
[59:10] example when it maybe it was small it
[59:12] would have been in a little a little
[59:14] cage enclosure thing I don't know where
[59:16] they put snakes they should be far away
[59:18] that's where they should put them but
[59:19] you see you know but I don't know what
[59:20] they're kept in but you know maybe but
[59:22] then as it was being fed it outgrew that
[59:25] enclosure so begin to control more of
[59:27] the house that's what happens when fear
[59:29] or some Intruder comes in you your
[59:32] double mindness it starts off with one
[59:34] thing one Avenue of your life and you
[59:36] begin to doubt question well yeah can
[59:38] even come down to should I be eating
[59:40] this food should I not be everyday
[59:42] simple things what about this color
[59:44] watch you double mindness what it starts
[59:46] off with something small but it grows
[59:48] into something very big why because it's
[59:50] being fed no the only thing a an
[59:53] intruder should be fed is lead
[59:56] shoot the
[59:57] thing by the word of God Amen that y
[1:00:01] that's that's what you should do with
[1:00:02] these your fear comes in you say no my
[1:00:05] God has not given me the spirit of fear
[1:00:07] but love power and a sound mind am mean
[1:00:10] that's my that's my inheritance right
[1:00:14] hallelujah amen are we all are we all
[1:00:16] together this morning amen see you got
[1:00:18] you got to look at your thought patterns
[1:00:19] because your thought patterns will be
[1:00:21] dictated by the word of God or by
[1:00:24] Intruders right and trud is always try
[1:00:26] and come in but we have been anointed to
[1:00:29] cast them
[1:00:30] out Hallelujah so fear can come in you
[1:00:33] know then you know then then your memory
[1:00:36] God can start youo God wants to use your
[1:00:38] memory but the devil wants to use it too
[1:00:41] see your memory can either build Faith
[1:00:43] or the devil can use it to actually try
[1:00:45] and pull Faith down try and disable
[1:00:47] Faith well how does God use your use
[1:00:50] your memory to build Faith you remember
[1:00:51] what you were but then you realize
[1:00:53] you're not that person anymore amen you
[1:00:56] go back in your testimony God you
[1:00:58] delivered me here you know it says in
[1:01:00] Hebrews 11 faith is the substance of
[1:01:03] things hopeful the evidence of things
[1:01:04] unseen right so faith is a substance of
[1:01:07] things hopeful the evidence of un you
[1:01:09] know things that are not seen so you can
[1:01:11] look at now in your life you are the
[1:01:13] evidence of Things Not Seen amen it's
[1:01:16] like people say how do you know Calvary
[1:01:18] happened you weren't there no but Faith
[1:01:21] what what the blood has done in my life
[1:01:23] is evidence of Things Not
[1:01:24] Seen hallelujah how do you know the
[1:01:27] atonement happened because faith has
[1:01:29] come into my heart amen and now my life
[1:01:32] is living evidence I mean of things that
[1:01:35] are not seen you can't go back there and
[1:01:36] prove it happened right you can't go
[1:01:39] back and find the cross and whatever
[1:01:40] more all those things no but the faith
[1:01:42] in my life proves to the world that
[1:01:45] those things happen hallelujah how do
[1:01:47] you know that his blood wasn't just for
[1:01:49] your soul but for your healing cuz faith
[1:01:51] is the evidence who's been healed who
[1:01:55] God's you know God's touched you amen
[1:01:57] now you are the living evidence amen
[1:02:00] that the blood atones not just for your
[1:02:02] soul but for your
[1:02:04] healing hallelujah amen praise God hello
[1:02:09] living evidence how are you doing
[1:02:11] today amen but you see now the devil
[1:02:13] wants to try and reason these things
[1:02:16] away he wants to use your memory against
[1:02:18] you and especially of of of things that
[1:02:20] you remember when after you became a
[1:02:24] Christian he wants to use those things
[1:02:26] against you right because remember the
[1:02:28] devil wants to an intruder will get in
[1:02:30] and say it's all about performance it's
[1:02:33] all about the victory that you perceive
[1:02:35] you have I say this if you're sealed to
[1:02:38] the day of your Redemption you've got
[1:02:39] complete
[1:02:40] Victory You've Won that's why I was
[1:02:42] singing that song I'm now seated at the
[1:02:45] table I don't know I've made it I don't
[1:02:47] know how you'd break that into a line
[1:02:48] but you know I've made it Hallelujah
[1:02:50] I've received the invitation I've come
[1:02:53] to his word I'm feasting on his word
[1:02:55] there's there's a seat at this table and
[1:02:57] the reason there's a seat at this table
[1:02:58] of his word is because there's a seat at
[1:03:00] that table on the wedding supper day for
[1:03:02] me Glory hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[1:03:07] I'm getting happy but you see an
[1:03:10] intruder way try and get you to diminish
[1:03:13] or sorry rather will try and amplify
[1:03:15] memories of past
[1:03:17] failures and if you let that thing grow
[1:03:20] your confidence will go down what you
[1:03:23] perceive as you being a Victorious
[1:03:25] Christian will go down like that snake
[1:03:27] will begin to grow that will take over
[1:03:28] your whole life where where it'll
[1:03:31] your faith where you feel how
[1:03:33] can I take God at his word now because
[1:03:35] I've done all those
[1:03:36] things amen that's an intruder that
[1:03:41] ain't you that's an intruder cast it
[1:03:44] out amen the word of God is here to get
[1:03:47] rid of those
[1:03:49] things thank you Lord Jesus amen so Jas
[1:03:53] had to come to a place of only
[1:03:56] Bel and this is where we are today God
[1:04:00] is conditioning us because he wants us
[1:04:03] to only believe not believe and reason
[1:04:07] not believe and imagine not believe and
[1:04:11] feel it you see faith is not a feeling
[1:04:14] but it will bring a feeling sure it will
[1:04:17] that's why we rejoice when we sing about
[1:04:18] the power of God and what he's done for
[1:04:20] us is because there's a testimony in
[1:04:22] here and then now what does that do
[1:04:24] because faith has come in then emotion
[1:04:26] comes out right but you see as I said a
[1:04:29] while ago this world is such a hybrid
[1:04:32] World especially into the realm of
[1:04:34] religion where where especially the
[1:04:36] modern Church they they they they they
[1:04:39] put people on an emotional high and what
[1:04:42] they're doing is producing an atmosphere
[1:04:44] that if people get to that emotional
[1:04:46] High then they have faith that's not
[1:04:48] always the case you see but it's a but
[1:04:51] it's a
[1:04:52] hybrid it's a it's a hybrid faith of not
[1:04:55] only believing who's ever who's ever had
[1:04:58] God do something when you don't even
[1:05:00] feel
[1:05:01] it I said about Anisa's tongue TI I've
[1:05:04] shared that testimony many times but you
[1:05:06] Shar that tongue tie needed an operation
[1:05:08] I you know and it wasn't just a snipper
[1:05:09] was around the sides I felt dead as a
[1:05:11] post but we asked God to loose it and he
[1:05:14] did did I feel it no but did I believe
[1:05:17] it yes right and sometimes you feel like
[1:05:20] you know you could conquer all things
[1:05:21] and you're just going to walk into a
[1:05:22] Rapture and God answers prayer that way
[1:05:24] too so never never diminish feelings but
[1:05:27] don't Place feelings above Faith No do
[1:05:29] you believe it it's not do you feel it
[1:05:31] brother BR never ask anyone do you do
[1:05:33] you feel he says do you believe Jesus
[1:05:35] said Do you believe it amen yes Lord I
[1:05:38] take you at your word you're more than
[1:05:39] able to do it praise the
[1:05:41] Lord amen so that's why I just come back
[1:05:44] to only
[1:05:46] believe praise the Lord so I'm just
[1:05:48] trying
[1:05:49] to now
[1:05:56] a squatter I mean a an intruder will
[1:05:59] always try and diminish the word of God
[1:06:02] as I've said before now Abraham came to
[1:06:05] a place in his walk now this is this was
[1:06:08] not in Genesis 12 this is in Genesis 15
[1:06:11] that he believed in the Lord and was
[1:06:12] counted to him for righteousness so he
[1:06:15] came to a to a phase where he
[1:06:18] left his five senses he left walking
[1:06:21] with his emotional realm and it was just
[1:06:24] faith alone
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:30] now everything now with your with your
[1:06:34] emotions so I'm just trying to find the
[1:06:36] quote here everything with your emotions
[1:06:39] everything is fine as long as it agrees
[1:06:42] with the word of God right so if you
[1:06:45] imagine if you imagine being healed that
[1:06:48] agrees with the word of God if you
[1:06:50] imagine Deliverance that agrees with the
[1:06:52] word of God right if you you know if you
[1:06:55] reason while God's word is true that
[1:06:57] agrees with the word of God so you can
[1:06:59] go with those senses in that regard but
[1:07:02] if it goes against the word of God what
[1:07:04] is that reasoning well I know God can do
[1:07:06] it but can he do it for me see that's an
[1:07:09] intruder yes he's done in other people's
[1:07:11] life but I don't feel he can do it for
[1:07:12] me that's an intruder we all know what
[1:07:15] I'm talking about right we all have mind
[1:07:16] battles okay you see that's an intruder
[1:07:18] we don't have to put up with that thing
[1:07:20] dictating to us to take the word of God
[1:07:22] or not you see so if they disagree with
[1:07:25] with the word don't you listen to them
[1:07:27] now imaginations conscious memories
[1:07:28] reasons and affections they're all right
[1:07:30] if they agree with the word but if your
[1:07:32] affection doesn't agree with the word
[1:07:34] get rid of it it'll you'll blow a flu
[1:07:36] right quick see if your reason disagrees
[1:07:38] with the word get away from it that's
[1:07:40] right the engine if your memory if your
[1:07:42] imaginations if your conscience anything
[1:07:44] disagrees with that what's on the inside
[1:07:46] get rid of it what do you got then
[1:07:47] you've got a solar system Hallelujah God
[1:07:50] set the stars in order said hang there
[1:07:52] till I call you amen nothing's going to
[1:07:54] move them when God can get a man in his
[1:07:56] hands till he can get his sense his
[1:07:58] conscience everything cleaned out till
[1:08:00] it stands with God behind it in the
[1:08:02] spirit there's not a devil in the world
[1:08:04] that can poke a doubt in there that's
[1:08:05] right he came right around and say you
[1:08:08] don't feel any better your conscience
[1:08:09] has even gone to that the flu is so
[1:08:11] clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlets
[1:08:13] blow a whistle glory to God it shines
[1:08:15] out certainly just as clean and clear
[1:08:17] for the word of God to work through the
[1:08:19] power of God see that's the main
[1:08:22] thing amen so if it does so so if it
[1:08:25] agrees that's good if it disagrees get
[1:08:26] rid of it it's an
[1:08:30] intruder
[1:08:31] amen praise the Lord so I'm just trying
[1:08:33] to find what see
[1:08:37] now um Paul would say this about
[1:08:40] Abraham see because many times he said
[1:08:42] therefore it is of Faith sorry for the
[1:08:44] reading but I was going to read a bit
[1:08:45] here that it might be by Grace the end
[1:08:47] of the promise might be sure to all the
[1:08:48] seed not to that only which is of the
[1:08:51] law but to that also which is of the
[1:08:53] faith of Abraham who's the father of us
[1:08:54] all and as it is written I have made
[1:08:56] thee a father of many nations before him
[1:08:58] whom he believed even God who quickeneth
[1:09:00] the dead and calleth those things which
[1:09:03] are be not as though they were who
[1:09:05] against hope believed in hope that he
[1:09:07] might become the father of many nations
[1:09:08] according to that which was spoken so
[1:09:10] shall thy seed be and not being weak in
[1:09:13] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:09:15] dead when he was about 100 years old
[1:09:17] neither the deadness of Sarah's womb how
[1:09:20] many times do we take the word of God
[1:09:22] and our current state and it's and and
[1:09:25] and what we're really looking at is is
[1:09:27] our current state how many times do we
[1:09:30] do that you see that's an intruder see
[1:09:32] the devil wants you to look from the
[1:09:34] word to
[1:09:35] yourself right so so if we look at how
[1:09:38] we feel like we feel like we'll never
[1:09:41] overcome God's far away we can never
[1:09:43] overcome this battle we're always going
[1:09:45] to be stuck in this we just all we can
[1:09:46] imagine is this thing is going to be
[1:09:48] with me till I go home that's an
[1:09:51] intruder but you see the devil wants you
[1:09:53] to look at that but God wants us to only
[1:09:55] believe only take him at his word like
[1:09:58] Abraham he didn't consider the state of
[1:10:00] his own self he looked all he sounded
[1:10:03] old he felt old he saw Sarah she looked
[1:10:07] old she talked old she felt old all
[1:10:09] those things it was impossible but he
[1:10:11] but but you see God see all those
[1:10:14] Intruders got kicked out of Abraham's
[1:10:17] life now I'm not talking about when he
[1:10:18] got made young again but before that all
[1:10:21] those things would got kicked out
[1:10:22] because his his imagination humanly
[1:10:24] would have said you can't be young you
[1:10:26] can't have a son you you know he came to
[1:10:28] a place where he where he rolls in the
[1:10:30] sand before God laughing how can this be
[1:10:33] you see but you see from that he God God
[1:10:37] brought him on because God wanted him to
[1:10:38] be the father of faith that the children
[1:10:40] of Abraham would be the same I mean that
[1:10:42] we come to a place we don't consider
[1:10:44] what's going on around us we don't even
[1:10:46] consider what's going on in here we
[1:10:48] don't consider what's going on in our
[1:10:49] family we just take God at his word see
[1:10:52] God wants us to actually not focus on on
[1:10:55] those things like Jas Jesus told Jas
[1:10:58] don't fear only believe basically Jas
[1:11:02] don't listen to what you've just heard
[1:11:03] don't don't listen to what you feel now
[1:11:05] that you've heard your daughter is dead
[1:11:06] and you feel that hopes is gone don't
[1:11:08] imagine what you're going to find when
[1:11:09] you get to the house and all these
[1:11:11] things no just
[1:11:13] believe amen those things are just
[1:11:15] Intruders D trying to stop your daughter
[1:11:18] coming to life
[1:11:20] again amen Abraham Abraham was in the
[1:11:23] same way he had to come to a place where
[1:11:26] you know he didn't consider those things
[1:11:28] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:11:29] through unbelief you see he did not let
[1:11:32] he did not let those things dictate to
[1:11:34] him to believe or not but was strong in
[1:11:37] faith why he was giving glory to God he
[1:11:41] can't see see this is what really blows
[1:11:43] those flues out blows those Intruders
[1:11:45] out amen is when you come to a place say
[1:11:47] God I take you at your word I don't know
[1:11:50] how you're going to do it I don't know
[1:11:51] when you're going to do it but you said
[1:11:53] you can do it you said your proom Pro
[1:11:55] because we got to realize Everything
[1:11:57] Jesus died for is yours amen every
[1:12:00] promise and it's not based on your
[1:12:02] current circumstances it's not based on
[1:12:04] your condition and how you feel you're
[1:12:06] doing it's what he has said see we got
[1:12:08] to get off this platform of looking at
[1:12:10] ourselves and look only at his word
[1:12:13] hallelujah giving glory to God and being
[1:12:16] fully persuaded that he uh what he had
[1:12:19] promised he was also able to perform
[1:12:23] don't we feel that way I feel the last
[1:12:24] 2020 before God has taken me on a
[1:12:26] journey Lord I'm just more fully
[1:12:28] persuaded amen that you're more than
[1:12:30] able to do it it's like you we think of
[1:12:32] the Rapture of the Rapture of the Bride
[1:12:34] how you going to do it Lord I don't know
[1:12:36] but I'm fully persuaded there is a
[1:12:38] people alive upon the the dead the dead
[1:12:40] in Christ are going to rise by the power
[1:12:42] of God we're going to be changed and
[1:12:43] with them meet the Lord in the air how's
[1:12:45] he going to do it by his quickening
[1:12:46] power but how's he going to do it well
[1:12:48] he said he's going to do
[1:12:50] it I I'm fully persuaded a Rapture is
[1:12:53] going to happen I'm fully ated amen
[1:12:56] hallelujah he's he's more than able to
[1:12:58] perform that even in even in this time
[1:13:02] that we live in where the world has
[1:13:03] fallen apart and chaos is on every hand
[1:13:06] but we don't look at those things and
[1:13:08] consider those things we consider God's
[1:13:12] word amen and the greatest B Li for
[1:13:15] brother BR talks about a man called
[1:13:17] Peter cartright Peter cartright felt led
[1:13:19] to have a meeting in a place this is
[1:13:21] this is how this guy operated he was a
[1:13:23] revivalist in the um in in America and
[1:13:25] he was he was one who really kind of
[1:13:27] spearheaded the Second Great Awakening
[1:13:29] greater Revival that swept through swept
[1:13:31] through
[1:13:33] America pardon me he felt led to have a
[1:13:35] meeting in a place one

[1:13:41] cleaning windows and getting the place
[1:13:43] ready maybe it was an old barn I I can't

[1:14:10] cart writes hard is a faith God said
[1:14:12] we're doing this right but now but now
[1:14:15] an intruder has come in and he's a
[1:14:18] physical man but he's trying to now play
[1:14:20] to Peter cartright's emotions he's
[1:14:22] trying to bring reasoning and trying to
[1:14:24] bring fear and trying in trouble and to
[1:14:26] to try and hinder what God has said he's
[1:14:28] going to
[1:14:29] do and then and then the town bully says
[1:14:31] to Peter car right well he said you're
[1:14:34] going to have to get through me to have
[1:14:35] a meeting so Peter car says well if I
[1:14:37] got to whip you that's the next thing I
[1:14:38] got to do so gets down off his ladder
[1:14:40] takes off his coat punches the guy gets
[1:14:43] on top of him and starts socking him a
[1:14:44] few and he asks him have you had enough
[1:14:46] he says yeah I did and then that guy
[1:14:48] came into the meeting that night he got
[1:14:50] saved Hallelujah you see but because he
[1:14:54] wasn't willing for an intruder to hinder
[1:14:57] anything cuz he felt lad no God's word
[1:15:00] has told me we're having a meeting am
[1:15:02] mean if God's words told me a certain
[1:15:04] thing it's I'm going to

[1:15:08] natural ex a natural
[1:15:11] example for a spiritual
[1:15:13] principle right cuz what are we do we
[1:15:15] just Retreat when the first sign of
[1:15:18] something triy an intruder tries to come
[1:15:20] in or do we say no God's word said I'm
[1:15:23] more than able I can do all things

[1:15:46] do it to the Natural how much more the
[1:15:47] Bride of Jesus Christ against spiritual
[1:15:49] powers in high places he was having a
[1:15:51] meeting in another place and there was a
[1:15:53] gang of bullies gang of bullies none of
[1:15:55] the preachers wanted to preach about 30
[1:15:57] of them I think and Peter caride do you
[1:15:59] know what he did he took off his coat he
[1:16:01] started fighting them in the
[1:16:03] meeting they came back and they got
[1:16:05] saved and none of the preachers wanted
[1:16:08] to preach that night and he got up and
[1:16:09] he took his text that the Gates of Hell
[1:16:11] shall not Prevail and they had a Revival
[1:16:13] in that place and a whole bunch of
[1:16:15] people got saved met the Lord because he
[1:16:17] was determined no I'm going to win
[1:16:20] because God has said this is true we're
[1:16:23] having a meeting in this place
[1:16:25] you take that for any promise of God do
[1:16:28] you let an intruder come in like those
[1:16:30] bullies with Peter carite try and hold
[1:16:31] it back or do you say no Satan I'm not
[1:16:34] going to accept your fear I'm not going
[1:16:36] to let this doubt rule me I'm not going
[1:16:38] to let you use my memories against me
[1:16:40] and my failes and all these things I'm
[1:16:42] going to walk with
[1:16:44] God Amen see you take the word of God
[1:16:47] and cut your way through every doubt
[1:16:48] this is how you get rid of this is how
[1:16:50] you get rid of The
[1:16:53] Intruders take the word of God and cut
[1:16:56] your way through every doubt you see
[1:16:58] sure that's it what's the next job get
[1:17:00] it done right next thing I'm going to do
[1:17:01] is get away from my doubts cut it down
[1:17:03] that's my job get all of my frustrations
[1:17:06] away if my senses tell me you feel bad
[1:17:09] the next thing to do is to cut that away
[1:17:11] how do you how do you do that you take
[1:17:13] the word of God above your
[1:17:15] feelings I know this is simple but you
[1:17:18] know you got to you got to nurse off the
[1:17:20] promise like like Abraham God came to
[1:17:22] Abraham as El Shai I think Genesis chap
[1:17:25] 17 and you know he says I'm alite means
[1:17:29] the strong Mighty God but also means the
[1:17:30] breasted God like a woman that
[1:17:32] breastfeeds her baby and God is telling
[1:17:34] Abraham Abraham all you need to do is
[1:17:37] Nurse off my promise nurse off my word
[1:17:40] and you'll get strength from that so
[1:17:42] Abraham you may have a lot of intruders
[1:17:44] of your age and how you feel and what
[1:17:46] you're hearing from Sarah and the
[1:17:47] trouble and you know it would have come
[1:17:49] to a place in their life that because
[1:17:52] Abraham believed they were going to have
[1:17:54] the child but it would become such a
[1:17:55] contentious thing month after month
[1:17:58] Sarah do you feel any different no I'm
[1:18:01] the same it would have become very
[1:18:02] contentious right but so but God came to
[1:18:05] Abraham said Abraham nurse off my
[1:18:08] promises that's all we need to do amen
[1:18:11] we've got you know it's it's at our
[1:18:14] fingertips the promises of God I think
[1:18:17] we should just take those things nurse
[1:18:19] off them and you'll find Intruders begin
[1:18:22] to scatter where'd that doubt go where'
[1:18:25] that where' that fear go where' those
[1:18:26] things those things are gone because why
[1:18:28] the the soldier on the battlefield in
[1:18:30] your mind the holy ghost is now Taken
[1:18:33] full control amen that whenever whatever
[1:18:36] something comes in it's like no I'm not
[1:18:38] looking at those troubles I'm nursing
[1:18:40] off the promise see my problems don't
[1:18:42] give me strength the promise gives me
[1:18:44] strength
[1:18:46] hallelujah
[1:18:48] amen praise the Lord but you see now s
[1:18:52] because of this's just come back to this
[1:18:56] Sarah because of Doubt tried to bring
[1:19:00] the promise a different
[1:19:01] way because of reasoning now see her
[1:19:04] reasoning wasn't God will do it in his
[1:19:06] time her reasoning was well I can't have
[1:19:09] the baby so take haar and then you can
[1:19:11] have the baby and then and then her
[1:19:13] affections would be well I've got a
[1:19:15] mother's love I've always wanted a child
[1:19:17] therefore you know I will love ishma
[1:19:20] like he's my
[1:19:21] own and then there would have been the
[1:19:23] memory of the sad Ness of of of having
[1:19:26] you know an empty cradle no child in her
[1:19:29] life and all these things so so the
[1:19:30] enemy was using those things against her
[1:19:33] and then of course that brought forth an
[1:19:35] ishma but what she needed was a
[1:19:37] visitation of the Lord what she needed
[1:19:39] was a visitation of the Lord I mean to
[1:19:41] blow out all those flu and all those
[1:19:43] things and that's what happened in
[1:19:44] Genesis Chapter 18 when God came down in
[1:19:47] flesh and began to speak to Abraham and
[1:19:49] discern her heart and all these things
[1:19:51] that was her
[1:19:52] visitation amen then after that what
[1:19:54] happened doubt turned to Faith amen all
[1:19:57] those Intruders were cast out of her
[1:19:59] life and then she received the promised
[1:20:02] son that's why it's so important you say
[1:20:04] well there's an intruder in my life what
[1:20:07] are you thinking on what are you
[1:20:08] listening to what are you feeding
[1:20:11] on Amen you want to feed on the word of
[1:20:14] God that builds Faith amen feed on the
[1:20:17] music Christian music you like you
[1:20:19] should we we should only be listening to
[1:20:21] those kind of things right feed on the
[1:20:22] good things of God and you'll see that
[1:20:25] those those those Intruders begin to
[1:20:28] scatter amen what it starts changing
[1:20:31] your thinking amen like I'm fighting a
[1:20:34] battle you've already won whatever comes
[1:20:36] my way I will overcome what does that do
[1:20:39] that takes away fear takes away
[1:20:40] reasoning Lord I'm going to overcome
[1:20:42] this because you've overcome it
[1:20:45] amen praise the Lord hallelujah we'll
[1:20:48] come we'll wind up a bit
[1:20:52] here amen now
[1:20:57] but you see now we must reach to the
[1:20:59] promise of God not through our emotions
[1:21:02] as I said Faith brings emotion but you
[1:21:04] see what happens is we're so anxious to
[1:21:06] see things done you we're so anxious to
[1:21:10] do something for God see this little
[1:21:11] lady uh is is is no doubt anxious to to
[1:21:15] live she wants to be well others are
[1:21:17] here wants to be well and then we hear
[1:21:18] about that case like the doctor the
[1:21:20] resurrection of the Dead the mighty
[1:21:22] things that our God has did then we're
[1:21:23] anxious and the thing thing of it is is
[1:21:25] we try to reach through these senses to
[1:21:27] grab a hold of something there like the
[1:21:30] like conscience you try and reach
[1:21:32] through by an emotional way so many
[1:21:34] people lots of times have misconstrued
[1:21:36] the word and I've been misunderstood by
[1:21:38] this by making alter calls I said I
[1:21:40] wasn't much on an altar call not meaning
[1:21:42] you shouldn't make an altar call but
[1:21:44] somebody get somebody by the arm and
[1:21:46] said oh brother John you know what me
[1:21:47] and you be neighbors all this time come
[1:21:49] up here to The Altar and get down what's
[1:21:51] he doing I wish I had a Blackboard here
[1:21:53] I could show you what he's doing he
[1:21:54] trying to get through his soul on
[1:21:57] affections just like you know your mom
[1:21:59] was a good lady and your father was a
[1:22:01] real Christian all these things why
[1:22:02] don't you come and serve God see he
[1:22:04] trying to work through an emotional
[1:22:05] realm you see he's maybe he's working on
[1:22:08] what a memory through the sense of a
[1:22:10] soul Oh Brother John you had a wonderful
[1:22:11] mother she died a long time ago a memory
[1:22:14] see you can't do that it's got to come
[1:22:16] down the line of free moral agency
[1:22:18] that's choice right see you yourself let
[1:22:21] the word of God you don't come because
[1:22:22] your mother was a good woman you don't
[1:22:24] come because you're a good neighbor you
[1:22:26] come because that God calls you to come
[1:22:28] and you accept him on the basis of his
[1:22:30] word that word is what means everything
[1:22:34] that word if you can get everything out
[1:22:36] of the way all conscious all senses and
[1:22:38] just let the word come and that word
[1:22:39] will produce just exactly here see
[1:22:42] what's all covered with well now you say
[1:22:44] well these conscious and senses and so
[1:22:46] forth don't have anything to do with it
[1:22:47] brother Bram certainly it does but if
[1:22:49] you let the word come in and cover it
[1:22:51] with conscience then it can't grow it'll
[1:22:53] be a formed word that's why if the word
[1:22:56] comes in but fear comes it won't grow
[1:22:58] like it should right did you ever see a
[1:23:00] grain of corn planted in the ground and
[1:23:02] let a stick fall over it it'll grow
[1:23:04] crooked any Vine even that grows up will
[1:23:06] because something has hindered it now
[1:23:08] that's what's the matter with our
[1:23:09] Pentecostal faith today is we've let too
[1:23:11] many things hinder it the faith that
[1:23:13] we've been taught the Holy Ghost that's
[1:23:14] been living in us we've let too many
[1:23:16] things look at somebody else right
[1:23:18] reasoning will make you look at someone
[1:23:20] else memory all these things will make
[1:23:22] you look at anything but the word but
[1:23:23] you see friend
[1:23:25] we live in an age where God has
[1:23:27] conditioned us to only believe amen
[1:23:30] isn't it wonderful that the W you know
[1:23:33] that the Lord is so good that when
[1:23:36] reasoning comes in you can identify it
[1:23:39] and say no that's a that's an intruder
[1:23:42] trying to reason away the word of God or
[1:23:44] the memory comes out of a past failure
[1:23:46] you say no I'm not accepting that
[1:23:48] because that's an intruded trying to
[1:23:49] hinder my faith amen or your imagination
[1:23:52] if you'll never get well if your
[1:23:53] affections on something else that you
[1:23:55] can you can you can see these things and
[1:23:57] realize no this is an intruder God has
[1:23:59] given me faith that I can only
[1:24:02] believe praise the
[1:24:04] Lord
[1:24:06] hallelujah amen now I will finish on
[1:24:09] this thing because many times we think
[1:24:12] well I need to have an absence of
[1:24:15] trouble to really only believe no God
[1:24:18] Wants You wants your faith to take
[1:24:20] control in the presence of your enemies
[1:24:23] amen he wants see see see many times he
[1:24:26] doesn't change your circumstances he
[1:24:28] changes you in the circumstance right to
[1:24:30] give you Victory right in the face of
[1:24:32] the
[1:24:34] devil amen so sometimes we think well
[1:24:36] I've got to go back and you know how you
[1:24:38] know you know how many times people you
[1:24:40] know some people will um will will hear
[1:24:43] healing lines and they'll hear you know
[1:24:45] the testimonies of the prophet and those
[1:24:47] things are good if you re if faith if
[1:24:50] you realize that same God is here right
[1:24:52] now right but the devil try and cover
[1:24:54] over with a with with affection and
[1:24:57] pervert that affection and say well if
[1:24:58] only I was back there then everything
[1:25:00] would be fine what does that do that's
[1:25:03] trying to diminish the power of God is
[1:25:05] still here to do exactly what he did in
[1:25:07] the prophet's life you following me amen
[1:25:09] but the thing is we need to like I was
[1:25:12] like I was talking to Christine about
[1:25:13] this we're driving down the hill
[1:25:16] and whenever enforce I mean whenever
[1:25:19] Intruders come in you got to realize you
[1:25:21] got to you think I didn't always think
[1:25:24] this
[1:25:25] way right when you first meet the Lord
[1:25:27] you don't think about those things right
[1:25:29] you know doubts don't control you your
[1:25:31] memories or failures don't control you
[1:25:33] all those things no it's just like the
[1:25:34] world is new I remember when I met the
[1:25:36] lord it's like the world was all new
[1:25:38] right the sunset was new the flowers
[1:25:40] were new it was
[1:25:42] amazing amen but God wants us to stay in
[1:25:46] that condition but take us through a lot
[1:25:48] of things right so now we have a
[1:25:50] testimony that the faith we have
[1:25:53] received has worked does work and will
[1:25:55] work right that soldier on the
[1:25:57] battlefield doesn't change but you see
[1:25:59] what happens many times I speak about
[1:26:01] myself very much here as we forget that
[1:26:04] Victory see it's not necessarily you
[1:26:06] know it's that not that we go by
[1:26:08] feelings and maybe I'll get this wrong
[1:26:10] but you know it's that feeling like I
[1:26:11] remember when I met the Lord I I just
[1:26:13] thought man everyone's going to believe
[1:26:14] that Jesus Christ is
[1:26:16] risen and I'm like recently I'm like
[1:26:19] Lord take me back to that take me back
[1:26:22] to that because remember God hasn't
[1:26:23] changed
[1:26:25] right God hasn't changed people haven't
[1:26:27] changed but what changes many times is
[1:26:29] our attitude amen our Outlook what's
[1:26:32] happened is an intruder's got in where
[1:26:35] we think no this word doesn't seem you
[1:26:37] know we should be careful how we share
[1:26:38] and sure we should have wisdom but we're
[1:26:40] got to realize the message that found
[1:26:42] you and transformed you will transform
[1:26:45] every son or daughter of God it doesn't
[1:26:47] matter what condition they're in doesn't
[1:26:49] matter what state they're in I was a
[1:26:51] drunk lost University student without
[1:26:53] hope but God found found me and gave me
[1:26:55] hope amen that's why I thought if you
[1:26:57] know everyone's going to believe this
[1:26:59] now why because I met him or he met
[1:27:02] me we got to remember those things
[1:27:05] Hallelujah you know you know that
[1:27:07] feeling of Lord all people need to do is
[1:27:09] get into your
[1:27:10] presence and it you fix everything who
[1:27:14] understands what I mean you you that you
[1:27:16] just that expectation Lord all they need
[1:27:17] to do is get into your presence we can
[1:27:19] be talking at the dinner table we can be
[1:27:21] in church but Lord you just need to come
[1:27:23] down and you will change that person's
[1:27:25] problem you'll fix everything you you
[1:27:28] that kind of feeling Lord you can do it
[1:27:31] Hallelujah Lord you're more than able
[1:27:32] amen Lord you're here you're present
[1:27:34] your word is true and Lord you're
[1:27:36] awesome but you see the enemy tries to
[1:27:38] come and say well but what about you and
[1:27:40] what you've been doing and look where
[1:27:42] your life has gone all these things we
[1:27:43] need to only believe we need to remember
[1:27:47] and then go back in reality maybe I'm
[1:27:50] just preaching to myself this morning
[1:27:51] but you see we got to remember those you
[1:27:53] know just that feeling now you're that
[1:27:55] attitude that you're that mindset God
[1:27:57] you can save
[1:27:58] anybody amen nothing's too hard for you
[1:28:00] no circumstances too hard see many times
[1:28:03] we you know we start off like that but
[1:28:05] then trouble comes in and and looks like
[1:28:07] the answer never comes and we begin to
[1:28:08] reason what's happening our faith is
[1:28:10] trying to be hindered by as an intruder
[1:28:12] has come in because we're looking
[1:28:14] through our five senses what we see what
[1:28:16] we hear all those things we're to come
[1:28:17] back to that place of remembering Lord
[1:28:19] You Found Me Lord you moved in power
[1:28:23] Lord you answered prayer Lord Jesus
[1:28:25] you've done many mighty things in our
[1:28:27] midst in our own lives you've done
[1:28:28] incredible things Hallelujah and then
[1:28:31] what do we do remember that and then go
[1:28:33] back to it in
[1:28:35] reality amen I'm just going to finish
[1:28:38] there but I think we need to remember
[1:28:41] see the devil wants to use our memory
[1:28:43] against us why don't we use our why
[1:28:44] don't we let God use our memory child
[1:28:48] you remember you were
[1:28:49] lost I found you remember when you were
[1:28:52] sick I healed you
[1:28:54] remember when you were in in distress I
[1:28:56] comforted you I'm still the same I
[1:29:00] haven't changed I'm still here I haven't
[1:29:02] left you I haven't forsaken
[1:29:04] you
[1:29:06] hallelujah amen so why don't we let God
[1:29:09] this morning Chase All The Intruders
[1:29:11] away maybe I haven't C you know maybe I
[1:29:14] haven't touched on them all but what you
[1:29:15] need to do is take the word of God and
[1:29:18] look how your thinking lines up with the
[1:29:20] word and what your attitude is towards
[1:29:22] every Divine promise because if your
[1:29:24] attitude comes and says well yes that's
[1:29:26] true but it's not for me that's an
[1:29:29] intruder yes he can help that person he
[1:29:31] can't help me that's an intruder yes
[1:29:34] that family sure but he can't save my
[1:29:36] family that's an intruder well I just
[1:29:39] don't have enough money or I just can't
[1:29:40] do this that's an
[1:29:43] intruder if it's anything that that that
[1:29:45] would try and put a block between you
[1:29:47] and the word of God being fulfilled
[1:29:49] that's an
[1:29:50] intruder okay so I think like we heard
[1:29:53] on Wednesday Let's Go Hunt some
[1:29:56] Intruders let's let God blow them out of
[1:29:58] our Lives amen that we can that that
[1:30:01] that faith can take control that we can
[1:30:03] only believe that we're not confessing
[1:30:05] if see see many times you think you you
[1:30:07] think about an imagination you you your
[1:30:09] feelings can be very strong failure is a
[1:30:12] very powerful feeling who's ever had you
[1:30:14] you feel like such a failure you feel
[1:30:16] like man I might as well quit what's the
[1:30:18] point in trying you know Lord why am I
[1:30:21] even here you know who's had that I've
[1:30:24] had those feelings many times it can be
[1:30:26] very real but you got to realize no the
[1:30:29] word of God is more real than that
[1:30:30] feeling what God has said about you and
[1:30:33] I is more real than that feeling what
[1:30:35] you imagine all those emotions that go
[1:30:37] on in your life you got to see we've got
[1:30:39] to take those things and cast them down
[1:30:43] every and those things try and exalt
[1:30:45] themselves against the knowledge of God
[1:30:48] that's our job and bring them into
[1:30:50] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:30:51] of Christ so bring every intruder
[1:30:54] obedient amen bring them into captivity
[1:30:57] to The Obedience of Christ the word
