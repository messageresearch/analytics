our lives and retched and changed and we're the most blessed people on the face of the earth you know to have we had food and raiment which would be continued but we have so much more than that we gave you an opportunity to to meet the King of Kings this morning to have the Spirit of God change our lives to make us make things better in whichever way that he would desire so let's um let's just give our full attention to God and put off the any other stuff that gets in the way because that's all futile and it's like this is pray this morning Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus that we

here the prayer meeting I sing praise the Lord most everyone's home hallelujah I have in sit god bless you great to see everyone they've been great to have all the visitors here god bless your brother in the back trust you feel at home as well I mean that's so you can have your seats this morning just just briefly just a few announcements so so on the weekend of the 17th to the 19th of of January which is a couple of weekend it's time brother El Rey is gonna he's confirmed he's gonna bring his youth down and brother Canaan as is going to well he hasn't confirmed numbers yet with me but bring down the youth from Whanganui and and fielding so if we could just have a meeting directly after service to speak about what we're going to do a rough timetable but you if we could just that'd be really good also Easter weekend brother areas are having a convention and and Taranaki and Stratford you're going to host it at the war memorial hall and brother Jason Watkins from South Carolina will be the guest speaker now can I can I have that slideshow so there's just a report from from brother Ronnie and Papua New Guinea regarding the convention in December that is quite small anyway so I just want to read this out and and and I want you to keep this in mind he says you housewives you don't have to be a preacher there's brother Barron speaking you do something for the glory of God remember eternal things is what lasts forever and that's getting soul saved let that be the first thing of all your work all your ideas all your motives yesterday standing he's holding a mother's hand my arm around her her chin quivering and a a new boy laying there dying she said Billy I've longed and longed for you to come back to the tabernacle I said sister Ferguson I'd like to do that I said well look sister I could get maybe 50 soul safety at the Tabernacle that would be a good crop for a year I could get a hundred thousand of them saved in some other land see when I walk into glory he says I don't want to god save me he done saved me that settled but the thing of it is when I get there I want to look around and see the stars shining I mean I want to see something that that makes something if you've if you would have died and I was a great man to present like Lincoln or something like that they'd build a big memorial but one day it wouldn't be but one soul saved and glory says your name will be wrapped in that as long as is an eternity rolling on so he saying to that sister because he could go out and minister all the souls that he saved their names are wrapped up amen and that in the church that that sent him forth right so so we will be identified with every soul that's been saved I mean by our giving by our prayer by by by support amen so now so brother Rodney just just a background to this before I share his his report some of you don't know but so in June last year I went up to Papua New Guinea to speak of the natural at their National Convention which was hosted by brother Robert naka and Goroka and brother Rodney was the translator that that translated for me in those services and at the time he wasn't even a message believer he was a he was a formerly a Pentecostal not a pastor but an area overseer of a denomination there but it wasn't so but the Lord was really working on him in those services you know after one of the first services I spoke you know after I had closed the service in prayer and it was just me and him standing on the platform he said to me he said brother pen did you put your hands on my shoulders when you prayed I said no I didn't touch you when I prayed he said I felt two hands come upon my shoulders like you're staying behind me as you're praying I said no that wasn't me God was dealing with them and and then there was a service where I speaking about this that you know the fact that this message returns us to the original Pentecost and then in that service he stopped translating for three or four minutes because everyone could understand perfectly in pidgin English like I was fluent and I'm not fluent at all that's why he has to translate and all the ministers everyone saw what was going on they were so moved I've been one of the ministers that tried to close the service and prayer very stoic man he was just weeping over the pulpit he was so gripped by what was going on and then also brother Rodney he would can you can you turn this down a bit please he was also really amazed to see himself as Esther in the scripture you know he would say after every service yeah this is so powerful you know he says he's never been in services like that with a word or so so alive even though he was a you know a regional leader and a Pentecostal denomination for many years now this he was so moved by this convention that he became a believer and then he went and he started witnessing to others now one of which was a Pentecostal pastor that he invited to come to the message church in broker to hear brother Robert knock a minister on the Sunday now the night before so so the Saturday night brother Robert had a dream and and in this dream a Pentecostal man and woman came into his church and the Lord said you will work with this man and the next morning that man saw so the Pentecostal pastor the brother Ronnie witnessed who and his wife came into church and and they they really enjoyed the service and that Pentecostal pastor invited brother Robert to go speak at his church and when he went to speak of that church there was about seven or six denominational churches came together to hear that message and some of them they said they're praying for 12 years to God to visit their Manor and T is rejoicing saying this is what we've been waiting for so this is what catalyzed now the convention they've just had now I want you to keep in mind this quote when I read this because remember every soul that's saved because of what what what your your support your prayer your giving your name will be identified with it an eternity now and I also want you to keep in mind that my rough estimates on the high side before this convention there was only two hundred believers in the tree so now this is brother Ronnie's words he takes us to me says praise the Lord brother Benjamin this is the this is the report accurately taken from the crusade he says 5p aww churches with five pastors converted to the message of the hour each Church has more than 100 Souls 3 UPC pastors one with a hundred and sixty-eight church members and two or 30 members each have converted to pastors from oneness churches also converted to the message of the hour with their entire families one st a pastor and five if sta members rebaptised in jesus name - 58 year old woman who are members of the EBC church also converted to the message and one Foursquare pastor with six of us church members converted that was one convention we've been praying for this for years that God would just sweep across their country because there's some up and some valleys up in that country that are God's elect they must hear this word they must become one with the Lord Jesus Christ then we can go home so that list you say well that's a lot of people they'll be brighter than that and that number but your names you will be associated with those souls because you gave because you prayed because you lifted that up before the Lord your names will be identified with this for eternity how they see so sometimes we think what's going on well things are going on and and in my you know you know from from what I've seen in the country that has never happened before and the message history of Papua New Guinea there's never happened like that before hallelujah so we're living in exciting times our God's alive hallelujah he found him up there I believe he can find you in the service this morning as well because the same God up there is present here this morning hallelujah amen isn't our God wonderful I mean so let's stand shall we let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 I want to read a couple of scriptures here from Hebrews 11 then we're gonna go to Joshua chapter 1 I mean I thought it was very fitting brother in pole singing that song let me stand on your heaven's table land a higher the other you know Lord lift me out let me stand hallelujah Hebrews 11:1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen are not made of things wish to appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by what she obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh a Mina let's go to Joshua chapter 1 I just want to read the first verse first 9 verses of Joshua 1 Amen who loves the Lord the sporting happy new year everyone hallelujah I mean brother Andy is saying what happened up there in Papua New Guinea well I found out so I mean but God bless you you know honestly without your giving in your prayer that wouldn't happen it's your work amen we are identified up there that's a body work so god bless you let's keep pressing the battle let's align the last one hallelujah why not us now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I see it unto Moses from the wilderness and to this lebanon even unto the great river the the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the Great Sea towards the going down of the Sun shall be your coast there shall be this shall not any man be able to stand before the all the days of my life for I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I'll not fail thee nor forsake thee hallelujah be strong and be of good courage front of this people shall I divide for an inherence the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only been our strong very courageous that thou mayst observe to do according to all the law which Moses a servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right handle to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth that thou shalt meditate there on day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that's written there and for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt be of good have good success have I not commanded thee be strong and be of good courage be not afraid neither bother I've been out dismayed for the Lord thy God as with thee wherever thou goest hallelujah let's bow our heads at a word of prayer or gracious father truly Lord we just want to tell you how much we love you just let us say how much we love you Lord Lord you're more than our next breath Lord you're more than life to us dear Lord to know you have ransomed us Lord by your blood Lord you have taken all our sin shame and guilt Oh God you took our judgments upon yourself o God the rest we should have received you you you took it into your bosom you took it upon yourself that day on Calvary and their God as well Lord as we read from your word Lord you have commanded us to be strong and courageous not to be dismayed my god father I pray dear Lord may your word anchor and every soul this day Lord may we be changed by your spirit dear Lord father may we ever closer walk with you Lord may you turn unbelief into faith O God doubt into a faith O Lord father may there be such a blessed assurance O God in every soul may revelation strike every heart dear God father of who we are and who you are oh Lord father may you grant it bless the reading of your word now bless a service Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats this morning I'd like to speak about Abel's lamb but I read here in Joshua chapter 1 because you know brother Branham would he would he would speak during his entire ministry he touched on it but but he came to the end of his life any any City you know he had a desire that he wanted to speak on the trail of the serpent now we know that he never condensed this into one service but but if you look into the entire message you can see the trail of the servant has already been preached but I mentioned last Sunday like to go through the scripture and see how the devil works in every age because he will come he will come against you in the same way and we know the Bible says that we are not ignorant to the devil's devices you may think well why do I need to know what the devil does in every age well you know I want to ask you the question do you know how to survive in your environment that you're living in you know your workplace your school your community your country this present age you know but and not just to survive but to overcome now so here we go now this now this is from Africa this is not my photo but this is a termite now when when we were at we're with brother Bryan Jones who am a hollow hollow there was a termite mound by the lion I'm enclosures he said brother put your finger in this hole so so so he put my finger in this hole and these termites started biting me now when they bite see they've got these big pincers here they bite and they just hold on now what he told me is you take the adult ones just say if you've cut yourself badly in the bush you take those termites and you get it to bite over where the wound is and and and the pincers just hold your wound closed then you rip the body off it'll stay there so they are they are nature's stitches now the thing is if I was in the bush in Africa I might need to know that because that's the environment I would be in right but if I don't know that I could be in trouble if I badly word myself how am I going to stitch myself up amen oh you say well or you could come across some predators or something now now in the bush and use yawn there's no there's no natural predators but you need to know just say if you're in the bush you would need to know what everything does you know most of us like myself you know we were at at at CEO and we're at Zealandia yesterday and there you you're walking along there's all different plaques and saying this tree does this and this Bush does this and I didn't know those things it just looks like a bush and that's a tree and and you're evidently we have the biggest protea in the world so I thought Africa I mean South Africa was at your national flower we've got the biggest one here anyway national sprint right so but you know but but they just like but but everything has a property now if you're living in the bush you would need to know how your environment works in order to survive and not just to survive but actually overcome you know sadly for myself you know I could maybe build a very rudimentary you know no shelter I know that there's like this green like hood or my stuff that grows and treats it that that's a very good firestarter that's as far as I know I would die I'd go hungry this food everywhere you can find it if you know what you're looking for you know but but you've got to know you got to know how your environment operates if you don't you'll die and it's the same so you know even but then and then if you take it another step higher and and you introduce predators into the into the environment now you really got trouble now this is now we got better photos than this but I just grabbed a couple like you take a hyena or a cheetah or you you you run to a herd of elephant how you're gonna survive that some people say well you just run no that's when you get killed but that's human instinct you run you don't run see but the thing is if you don't know how to if you don't know the behavior of these animals when you come across them you're in big trouble but if you do know the behavior of it then you can actually sidestep you can you can avoid them you can get around them or if you're hungry you can hunt them and and and eat them you say well I don't live in the Kruger National Park no but there's worse predators in New Zealand than a hyena it's called the devil and there's a lot of them and they hunt in packs and they're very good at what they do so you've got to know your environment you've got to know what's in your environment because we can't just walks like me wandering into the bush somewhere you know you can say I'm a tough guy I can handle the bush now you'll die doesn't matter how tough feel you think you know how great Bushmen you think you are if you don't know how to live in your environment you will die and it's the same thing in the spiritual if you don't know this environment this evil world you live in you will be charred by the devil you'll be chewed up spat out by him but if you know his trucks you know how he'll come against you you can withstand in this evil day and you can overcome Amy as it season you know season first Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary three the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour so we need to be very aware of his devices now last week we know when when I was at work I was talking to Christine on the phone and she was driving with the girls and and and the girls are singing the song and heavenly armor will into the land the battle belongs to the Lord no weapon that's fashioned against us will stand the battle belongs to the Lord and something struck me when I heard them singing I mean we have heavenly armor with heavenly armor I mean we have heavenly armor we have the whole armour of God I mean the Holy Ghost anointed word living at us we have the heavenly armor I mean we've been equipped by God in this day now if we've been equipped by God in the state and now we've entered the land hallelujah but we're going to recognize that there's squatters there's a devil sitting on every divine promise of God to try and stop you I mean obtaining the promise that is rightfully yours I mean as as as God told Joshua every place your foot shall tread I give it unto you you have to go and possess he says the whole land is yours but you were to go make it yours amen so now every divine promise hallelujah amen is yours but you got to go get it so so in heavenly armed amen we've been to the land now now this land we know as Christ it's the word brother Branham says and proving his word 1964 he says the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and make his paths straight was he was he preparing the way of of the word then that the word might be made manifest how old are you don't you see in shadow stop here for a minute and the last days has got to be a place repaired for the word to be made manifest which is the Bride of Christ and we're now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man so the son of man the word is the new land but you have to go in and take every promise I mean so that's why you know but you see the devil his job is to stop you obtaining the promise that is yours now Joshua was told now we are going to get to Abel's land but I wanted background this now Joshua was told that no there shall not be any man shall be able to stand you all the days of thy life as I was with my so I shall be with thee I'll not fail thee nor forsake thee now why did God tell them that no man would be able to stand before him all the days of his life is because men would try and withstand I mean try and stop Israel possessing their land now we know we are not here to possess a physical land but a spiritual land a spiritual inheritance so that that those that I was standing US and not men but they are spirits they're demon powers but you've been equipped in the south to dis possess him and take your inheritance in the Word of God hallelujah now brother Bram is as when he had the vision of the hand coming down and pointing to Joshua 1 2 9 and he says he's to way I mean I mean 2/3 of the way over to Canaan sphere land and every promise laid in the land he was walking on the Kings Highway and some of the people were afraid because he also feels that there was a black mamba snake there was death was was was slithering around on me on the on the highway and he had a vision there that this that this Mamba came out and tried to bite Yvonne now we know when a Mamba a black mamba bite someone its death amen it's death and they're very aggressive creatures you know and and sometimes snakes can be very small but very poisonous you know we saw did one in the Kruger was a Boomslang snake it was about yay long but they're deadly snakes they don't look like much but they're deadly one bite will you're done basically if you can't get anti-venom so the devil doesn't always come along as some great big something but there's poison behind his fangs right and you got to be very careful I mean because death is moving in this age I meant by but thanks be to God we have something to overcome that death now in that snake when that Mamba tried to bribe a bite brother branham in the dream I mean it tried to get closer to him and eventually it came to a point where it couldn't get any closer to him why is that because there was a power there was a force enter my baptism the Holy Ghost that kept this away I'm a that's the only way we can go and take every promise of our land as ever God Himself is present I mean he is in US but then he had to now speak he had to speak to that that that mama to bind it I mean you've got to speak to your Mountain I mean you just can't say well as me no you were to say uh and heavenly Amma I've been to the land I've been equipped to overcome in the south I mean God has given me the power hallelujah this word is living in me Christ Himself Ananda is in his bride I'm equipped hallelujah I am able I mean so then you know you've got to speak to your storm you've got to speak to the devil that's fighting you all fighting your family you've got to address it I mean cuz you have the power and you I mean you have the authority to do it I mean as the Prophet was given the authority you can bind death in every spirit under I mean combine this and all the ones under it hallelujah and then so and then so brother says I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ and that and that mama turned into a glass like a tempest and sign and the life went out of it hallelujah and they said that I may know I lost you in the name of Jesus Christ it came back to life in and then he bound them again just to show now you say well that's the Prophet no that's not just him I mean we got to understand wait can we have this back up again now brother Brown would speak he would speak in the in the church age book and he said now the key was given to me of the Lord says when he's identifying each messenger for the age but he says now the key was given to me the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age as a most scriptural one in fact it might be the whole Keystone of the Bible it is the revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is and Hebrews 13:8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now a key stone a key stone if you look at old old buildings this stone here is the key stone and it actually holds the arch together it holds everything together if you pull that stone out the whole thing will collapse so he sees that that this is actually the thing that holds the Bible together this is the key stone the most important element of the scriptures that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that he does not change and even the definition of key stoners as the central principle on which all else depends that's what he says I mean I mean there's the dictionary definition so he says it's the keystone of the entire Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so the same God that was in the prophet as in the bride the same anointing that was on Elijah fell upon Elijah right so the same authority given to the Prophet over the devil the bride has the same authority I mean she has the same power to bind or to loose just as the Prophet now it says in 2nd Corinthians 4 he says we having the same spirit of faith according his room I believed and therefore I have spoken ye also believe and therefore speak hallelujah so we have the same spirit of faith amen hallelujah so therefore we believe in therefore speak you've got to address your enemy amen now he would say at the start of his ministry when he would relate when the angel Lord came to him and commissioned him to take the gifts of divine healing to the world he says this in 1948 at thy word and Phoenix he says you have never seen them so we have never seen them come by by humbly and appreciative oh that's where God moves right in that channel it's wonderful isn't it certainly God is making up as jewel you understand what I'm speaking of now now now shall we bow our heads now for prayer father realizing that I'd be afraid to step into this realm now without you would would hold my hand now my mind is going back to around two years ago when in the room that night the angel the Lord came walking in there and said you've been born in this world to take a gift of divine healing to the people many will not believe you yet many will if you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you not even cancer shall stand before your prayer angel of God I do not see you but I know you're standing near please don't know us my heart and know how I love these people see he was taught by God if you're sincere and get the people to believe you now why would he have to get the people to believe you because of the people did not believe him then unbelief would hinder the moving of the Spirit of God and it's very easy to say oh I believe in Jesus but he I mean he's in his word presently here now I mean so even even as Jesus when he was a Nazareth it says in Matthew 13 58 and many things and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief they were in that they had their synagogues they believed in Jehovah God but Jehovah God became flesh as Jesus Christ Jehovah the Old Testament as Jesus of the news that same God they claimed to believe was standing in the inmense made flesh but because of their unbelief he couldn't do many mighty works now in Exodus 19 and 9 and the Lord said unto Moses i lo I I come unto the in a thick cloud that the people may hear when I speak under the am believed thee forever and Moses told the words of the Lord unto the people he said why would why would God come to Moses and say I want the people to believe you forever because God was going to speak through that vessel and so God wanted to supernaturally vindicate Moses that the people would believe the words of Moses and that they were not his words but they were God's words now it is the same thing today God I'd say over Vindicator brother Browns ministry Amen that that we would be able to have we would recognize that was not his thoughts or his interpretation of the scripture but it was the author himself the Lord Jesus Christ saying this is what my word says it means so now as as we read their brother Browns Commission he said he was told nothing would stand before his prayers now we actually must recognize that as not just for the prophet that's for the Bride of Christ I mean it's also for the bride because the same Living God that was veiled in the Prophet is now on the bride doing the same works hallelujah we must recognize that you've got to know who you are you're to recognize what you've got I mean not all one day know what you've got right now maybe brother I see when the weakness of Christian gets on their knees the king of house shakes while they I say and they take the kingdom of hell a time or two yes I'm not very strong in faith that's fine you'll still shake hell ain't meant you got to recognize what God has given you and you say Lord thank you it's mine how do I claim your name hallelujah thank you Lord I mean like I said to you last year you got to make a list have you made your list have you made your list I've got my list I wonder what's on the list well as it manifests you'll see it hallelujah amen so we you know so brother bran was asked a question 1963 he was asked a question with the Bride of Christ heaven ministry before the rapture his answer is sure that's what's going on right now the Bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour see the Bride of Christ she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the Bride of Christ she's got a ministry great ministry the Minister of the hour but it'll be so humble so the bride has a ministry right now and you're part of that ministry say I'm not five fold but you're part of the body of Christ I mean even you here you can create an atmosphere of faith where God can come down and change your life how that your amens your prayers how you sing how you worship you can bring God on the scene and change this whole service change someone's life forever you're very powerful in the eyes of God amen God will stop listening to an archangel to hear your prayer Ilia because you're more important to him than Gabriel or Michael or one of the great angels whoever it is you're more important because he never died for them but he died for you I mean he rants some doing ever rent some them hallelujah so he will say that quite Gabriel quite Gabriel I'm listening to my daughter she's praying to me I mean my son's talking to me hold on yo I want to talk my brides talking to me shush hallelujah of course they're good angels so they will say yes sir yes and they will so we we must recognize the ministry we have the devil always try and belittle what you have but never let him we have to look through the eyes of God at who we are and that doesn't make us proud that should make us more humble and more thankful Lord if you take me from the gutter of death and sin lift me up into heavenly places and wash me and cleanse me and change me make me a new creature hallelujah shouldn't that make us more humble and appreciative or thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah now he would also say the lady I see in church the church age book he said then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from God became the living epistles written own of all men for the generation when the Methodists failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the ages until in this last day there's another people in the land hello people in the land under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age so the same same Christ that came to the Prophet that same Lord Jesus comes to you and he manifests the same word through you hallelujah now this is done I mean the only way that this can be done as is the fulfilling of Revelations ten eight to eleven I mean with John we understand as a symbol in the book am I going too fast I really want you to get this because you're to say and heavenly armor I've entered the land the battle belongs to Lord I've been equipped for this hour I've been made for this hour been ordained for this hour every devil every weapons going to be at my feet I'm going to be conqueror I mean Christ Paul said we're more than conquerors through him that loved us how are you gonna say this morning I'm more than a conqueror you know we say well the devil's big he moves in shadows I don't know how to fight him he'll give you God will give you the ability he'll give me the revelation I mean how to conquered how to get out of the pit you maybe and even this morning Allu you saw it's the only way that this can be fulfilled is the fulfillment of revelations 10 8 to 11 we know all scripture must be fulfilled all scripture is going to be fulfilled so there's gonna be a be a people on the earth that become one with the revealed word I mean and then they begin to prophesy again so they become one with the open book which is Christ and they speak the contents of the book amen to tear down the your Satan's Kingdom hallelujah amen as as John was told I mean take the book eat the book become one with the word don't just talk about it don't just just just discuss it become one with him become one with Christ li to manifest in your being I'll let the word let the word put on flesh in you I mean as Christians we're more than just to talk about being a Christian I mean but to be a Christian the only way you can be a Christian is of Christ Himself comes and dwells in you and he's the Christian and you you can't do it in yourself we must understand that man has miserably failed trying to be a Christian man has miserably failed because they've tried to do it in their own ability if I just try harder if I do this if I do this you can't do nothing you've just got to surrender and die and let him live everyday oh now that's real victory hallelujah and and and the Lord told us to do it and the reason he told us to do it is because he gave the ability to do it he never put something on his people and says you can't fulfill this hallelujah I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me that's more than a nice Instagram pickle something to put on the fridge it's a reality hallelujah now so we hit a bit where we're here in the fulfillment of prophecy now Abel we read in Revelations I mean sorry Hebrews 11 and for by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now Abel Abel had a revelation that it was a blood set in the garden his gift was a manifestation of what was in God's mind that the Lamb of God will come and take away the sin of the world now Genesis we know is the sea chapter so everything starts off in a seed form and then it grows to a great big tree in the Book of Revelations everything starts in Genesis so we have a principle in the in the book well in Genesis 4 here where Cain kills Abel the the wicked religious destroy the righteous now it's spirits and it's spirits to try and destroy holy ghost worship a true spiritual union with God that's what the Antichrist spirit tries to do see see the Antichrist spirit doesn't try and make even atheists it wants people to be religious because the devil Satan wants to be worshipped he says I'll be like the Most High in Isaiah so to be like the most high he has to be worship like the Most High he all is as a mimic of who God is he's trying to mimic God so so the Antichrist what it does is it tries to destroy a mean holy ghost worship Amy now let's go to know we know that spirits don't die the people may die but the spirit on them that manifest that lives on their brother Burman saying in in the god of this evil age he says as she is part of the groom true to him in every point waiting and waiting the wedding uniting not at the ecumenical council but in the sky at the wedding supper she has been given he says this is for our own church he's been given and revealed to her the seven sealed mystery of the Bible see she sees the folly of the of the deceiver so every so very close to the truth that almost deceived the elected she sees it see the two opposing spirits at work in this evil age can you see it each every each very religious Cain and Abel spirits again coming to their heads still same as they started one worshiping by beauty and by knowledge about education by science and by ethics the other one by faith of the revelation of the Word of God both them standing right in this building this morning he says that's right what's he saying cuz those spirits have come to unto this age one by ethics and beauty and knowledge by education by science the other by revelation of the word of God well what do you mean by by by by ethics well it's ethically right morally right to be a Christian so its reason comes in well I should because it's good you know I don't want to be like those people I want to be good so it's oh it's ethically right what about by science well people try new science to be believers I spend before I met the Lord because I studied biochemistry at university I read creation science till I could find it no more to read nothing wrong with it but it didn't help me meet him I learned about his crashing it was excel in terrestrial hallelujah this Bible became a living reality hallelujah so it's all good to know about creation and how God's hand because God is in nature if you look long enough you right he's a nature they mean but you got to meet him they met and and the other by faith of the revelation of the Word of God he is both him and standing right here this morning now let's go to let's go to get let's go to Genesis 4 and 1 let's just read this little bit I have this thing ok good and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord we know all life comes from God yep and she bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord so there's something in these people to worship because then men to worship something you'll worship some people just worship themselves you see Instagram and all that yo YouTube bloggers that is worshiping themselves it's all vanity projects that yo most of it see so you worship yourself a job your family a car some hobby people give their lives to such small things I mean but we should be worshipers of God and spirit and truth so so they're both worshipers now and Abel also brought of the first things of his flock and the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering now it's not recorded that that that their parents were Adam and Eve told them anything about what happened in the garden but something moved in them they have to worship this God that that created them now Cain Cain's altar he brought his fruits he brought his works of his hands his own ability but it doesn't have any life in it it just had it it just that plant life I didn't have any animal life didn't have any blood member the scripture is without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin and people will try and take the blood out of the gospel the reality of the blood they'll just explain it away talk it away oh you don't need that you don't need a real birth I mean what is that that's a cane spirit try to take the reality of the Holy Ghost out of the message I mean this message is called to restore us to original Pentecost and I'm not talking about denomination Pentecost as experience where God came in 12th of this church and manifested his word out to the aged I mean we may not be there in the 1st and the beginning of the church but at the end I mean a we've got a work to fulfill we're going to work to manifest upon the earth Holly we're not here just to try and go back into history no God is here to fulfill his word and he's put you to fulfill it here so I'd say Lord take my life make it by and come and live hallelujah so here he was he had his beautiful fruit because of why cuz of knowledge it was reasonable to him I should offer something to this God he was a believer he wasn't an unbeliever he was a believer right and enable Abel broader brought the first things of his flock now something struck Abel I don't know what had been like but no doubt you know he would have seen this lamb be birth maybe help the mama I don't know would you know would lead it out into pasture look after it and there would have been other lambs around but something struck him I've got to take the slam he looked into the eyes of that lamb this is just me and something struck him said this one is an offering he'd never heard about offerings before I don't know but something that I'm seeing I've got to take this one he picks it up Cain's got his beautiful altar all the flowers and the fruit and all these things that looks over so lovely here comes brother am said he found a vine or something he said I don't know if they had him to make ropes in those days he took a like like a vine tied it around me I'm lambs Nick and and he began to lead it to the altar just as Christ was laid up Calvary and then he took him and then you know there's no record of them having any kind of metal so he took a sharp knife and he laid the lamb down who seen a lamb be killed who's actually seen that you want to see something you go see that say what because you'll understand the penalty of sin that our Lord paid was horrible and he was more than just a lamb being you know his throat being slit he has marred more than any man but you see the bleeding of the lamb the crying is its life is going out some of us need to spend some more time on some farms I think you know you know but but he took that sharp stone he said begin the hacking hack on the throat of that lamb and until finally his blood was released and its life was poured out it doesn't look pretty neither is that when a people are struck by a revelation and give their life to God snorting crying boo-hooing ain't meant pouring themselves out it's a mess at birth anywhere is a mess amen but when he was giving that lamb God said I can identify myself and that boys worship because that lamb is a revelation of who I am holy it's the same thing with you and I when God could look down at you and say I can identify myself than those people because their worship as me holy their life was me how they dresses me how they speak as me how they how they treat each other it's me hallelujah amen - he had so it says that that God had respect unto Abel and to his offering now we read in Hebrews 11 he had a more excellent sacrifice than that of K so Cain's sacrifice was excellent it wasn't haphazard it wasn't lazy it was sincere it was serious they knew that something something moved on them we've got off of something so that we can have peace with God so he didn't he did just haphazardly take it or leave it here you know here's some oranges or apples throw it down on some rock here it is you know blase he was serious but it wasn't according to the revelation of God it was by his own understanding and we can't be believers because of our own understanding of the Bible you know the one of the most dangerous things I hear as people say the message makes sense well the Bible makes it now that's dangerous because that's just intellectual reasoning of course the Bible makes sense the mystery of God's finished in this day right although we know what the Bible says from serpent seed all the way down to the messenger and the ladder rain mother brown said this in time minister I mean I mean messenger will reveal that so it's not it's not a surprise I mean where someone can come and just show you every type and shadow through the Bible because the books open but when science is that just makes sense now that's dangerous because intellectual reasoning as opposed to revelation amen it should make sense but don't just stop there do you keep walking till you meet the lamb until you meet the author of the word himself I mean because remember he's the same yesterday today and forever if the Apostles could meet him I could meet him maybe a brother Brown can meet him I can meet him oh yeah you know you can have visitations of angels in your heart you know there's more visitations of angels and the New Testament than the old and just didn't quit visiting just because Jesus shed his blood upon the earth amen so we don't just want to stay we don't just want to stop there and say well it makes sense no you got to meet him and when you meet him it changes your life forever it changes how you think you can actually operate in the environment you're in because the one who allowed the environment to come into being the one who created it actually comes out says I'm gonna be your guide through this wilderness hallelujah amen I did now Abel I mean I mean Cain it says but unto Cain and to his offering God did not have respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell he got mad he got offended he got offended at God God why didn't you receive my worship let's see it's all about attitude if thou doest well but in God but yea but then the Lord spake under Cain that's there's no record on the scripture that the Lord ever spoke table and then the Lord asked Cain why are you angry why are you Roth and why is our countenance fallen well I mean yeah wait we'll go here if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and unto these show and to thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so basically saying Cain just do like your brother did you'll be accepted see God gives you about an opportunity whosoever will let him come all the company or no wise cast out but it wasn't in cane to come and we'll go into that later it wasn't in him to come and then so Cain talked with his brother Abel and it came to pass that when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel and slew him so here's the spirit in the beginning religious worship God but hates the true worshiper that God receives and is not willing to surrender their will to God's will that God will receive them as well my Lord Jesus help us right now amen so then what happens Cain kills Abel Abel you can't worship like this why did you offer a lamb tell me why why do you do like I did we're family we should be doing this together why did you do why'd you take a lamb as hideous all the blood everywhere it was all over you and all over hallelujah I mean the blood of the offering went all over the altar all over you I mean that same smell of the lamb was all over yours it was all messy hallelujah same thing with you and I the blood that was in our sacrifice comes all over us that life that was in the blood comes all over us hallelujah the smell the lamb comes all over us hallelujah that when you see Abel you see the lamb hallelujah you see that same life Halle that innocent life comes upon him hallelujah ha but you shouldn't worship that way let's me see look I had this fruit like my best my best fruit it was perfectly shaped everything was perfectly right why didn't you just do like me he was jealous because one had God come down and say yes you're my son you more than Adam son go back another step you more than Adam son you're my son and that's why I moved on your heart that you would recognize hallelujah then it takes the shedding of blood parlor this is why hallelujah but a but Cain was jealous because he stood there do this thing I guess we got hope now he's jealous and so that spirit now comes and tries to stop the moving of the Holy Ghost it tries to just make us have a form and become formal cold dead and powerless and brother and says God hates a powerless Church because that's not that's not what he died for he didn't die just for a society of people just to talk about things and live the same kind of life he died that a people would be transformed I meant that the life that was in the blood of Jesus Christ would come unto you the Holy Ghost and would transform your life and make you a new creature in Him and saying that we're new creatures is more than just a buzzword or something nice to say it's a reality I mean once when some of us were with drunks and lost and caught up with all kind of spirits and and darkness and depression and brokenness and whatever it was but then God came and he says I'm not just gonna patch you up I'm gonna transform you that you're actually a new creation hallelujah amen and when you I don't know the person I once was died hallelujah it's like when Abraham became Abraham he received a new name because a new life was living write a name represents a life so Abraham he had Ishmael here - male but then when he received a new birth and became Abraham and type he you know he received a new birth and type became Abraham then he has Isaac and God says to him Abraham take thy son thy only son and go and go offer him on the mountain go well hold on God but there's a schmao he even looks a bit like him but when God looked down he says no Ishmael as Abraham's son it's not Abraham son I cannot attribute Ishmael to Abraham because it was Abraham's son Abraham is now a new creature that man Abraham died he's now Abraham so the works of his flesh are not attributed to him anymore because he's a new creature hallelujah so the things we once did they may even haunt us but when God looks down he says I do not attribute that to you because you know a new creature and me I've made you a new creature so those things I don't i cannot reconcile them with you with them hallelujah amen if god looked down and said that about abraham he says that about you hallelujah but but these things are still around me I'm still haunted by their memories Ishmael was still in the camp but God says I don't attribute this day brahim that's Abraham son glory hallelujah I like that don't you Amen so he rose up Cain rose up killed his brother and slew him and then the Lord said unto Cain where is like where is Abel thy brother and Cain said to him I know not am I my brother's keeper keeper we are our brother's keeper the answer actually is the issue I Cain you're your brother's keeper he's part of the family of God you're actually responsible for his welfare maybe not to be some selfish and with looking person who doesn't care about no one else know that was casing am I my brother's keeper yes you are your brother's keeper and then we are here for one another we're not here for ourselves I mean we're not here to see well what can I get only no God what can you pour through to help someone else that's like you know the scripture says those that are friendly have friends right so in order to our friends you be friendly it's real simple you want to have friends be friendly to everyone around you hello you'll create an atmosphere around you you have such a personality people say I want to hang out with that guy or that girl why cuz they're friendly somebody's old no one loves me no one's have talked to me are you friendly their respective of how they're treating you just be friendly and eventually those those bits of ice will thaw and warm up to you hallelujah I meant remember the merciful shall obtain mercy so if you want to receive mercy from others be merciful Amen it's pretty straightforward really you know you want people to make treat others how you want to be treated and how we treat others we want to basically we have be beaten up thrown on the gutter cast aside that's that's how sometimes we treat each other like that's the thing I tried and still am i girls do you want to be treated that way [Music] do you want to be treated that way you know I've got to the one who did it do you wanna be treated that way no of course not what don't treat her that way Jesus is how you treat others you'll be treated the same way you followed me if it works for children works rattles to you amen that's that's good for everyone so he is he should have been his brother's keeper because of selfishness and pride he killed his brother to destroy the Holy Ghost moving amen and he said and then and then God says to him and verse 10 I think it's there he said what is thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground now the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things in that of Abel because the blood of Abel all could do is cry out for you know I've been killed revenge me avenge me O Lord but the blood of Jesus Christ cries out mercy it cries out freedom and cries out Redemption how that cries out salvation hallelujah it doesn't just cry out avenge me it says no he said forgive forgive them father they don't know what they do says blood cries out freedom how it cries out Liberty hallelujah amen it's not a blood just sit sit your your the life of God is it's busy it's working hallelujah it's busy upon the earth it's looking for honest hearts to come and dwell in hallelujah that's up to you what are you gonna do with it now Jesus would say in John eight when people speak about serpent seed I like John chapter 8 he says I speak Jesus being to the Pharisees I speak that which I've seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father he's saying we have two different fathers I do that though job so you know my father Jesus says but you scribes and Pharisees are doing that you do that which you've seen with your father what were they doing it was Cain and Abel once again the same spirits had come down now I'm making it one big mess big jump thousands of years but the same spirit and Genesis's same spirit in the Gospels I mean that's why they did not receive him receive Christ because here he was didn't come through any of their organizations Abel didn't come to Cain's altar he came outside that that that way of thinking brought his own offering it was a revelation of God he bypassed Cain's way of doing it Cain got jealous you know here comes John the Baptist's out of the wilderness why didn't he come the way of his father being a priest because his job was too important you think naturally minded well of course Zacharias would be a priest in there of course the forerunner would come through a priest home because then he'd learn the scripture and he'd Belva you know know how to treat it you know conduct himself in church and all these different things God said no I can't have him come that way you're going into the wilderness to till your appearing of Israel why because this job was too important to be contaminated with man's ideas and it's the same thing with us God has to take our thinking I think I've seen it before I think brother Andy said it first and I just loved it yeah people say oh you're brainwashed well yes my brain needed washing it needed a good for soaking well because it was filthy and dirty and mucky with the world that needed a washing hallelujah so that's why you know we our job is too important as well what's your job we're gonna take a body change we're gonna walk from this world to the next world amen Jesus says in Matthew 24 this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in to all nations in the end shall come who wants the end to come who wants to go home so we have a job to do we are here well you know there's a reason we are here in this great place why aren't we in the fancy suburb because the Gospels preached to the poor Jesus said that's why we're here hallelujah I love this place I actually do I like it and they answered and said unto Abraham is our Father jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you do the work you would do the works of Abraham so if he really was spiritually your father you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the deeds of your father they said unto him we are not born of fornication we have one father even God they knew exactly what happened in the garden you do the deeds of your father and they said then they said to him where be not so I'm just repeating this you are not born of fornication you're you have one father even God Jesus say said unto them if you if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it Cain and Abel it's all through every age no during that I'm just gonna skip into the church ages very quickly but I want you to I just you know we are called if you get start reading through the church age book I'm just making a journey through brother Graham emphasizes so strongly we have been returned to the original book of Acts Pentecost before the Ephesian age started when when the church fell we've been restored back to that now that now that that doesn't mean we just preach acts to receive the holy God no we receive it he lives and then we grow right but we have not come to a place where we just have a formal culture CH and we do not just have formal cold lives he would say in the ephesian church age now this is speaking of the of the temple that was an emphasis of Dhyana he would speak about how that that is very fitting of what they did in that temple to speak of what the Antichrist spirit was willing to do through the age but I just pick up a part of his secondarily the temple had within its confines the Virgin priestesses who performed the religious acts of the temple this showed fourth day that ceremony informing ritual and works would take place of the Holy Ghost and no law would charismatic manifestation fill the temple of God shall read that again he says this showed forth the day that ceremony inform and ritual and works would take the place of the Holy Ghost and no longer would the charismatic manifestation filled the temple of God I want the charismatic manifestation of God to filled my temple I want him to come and live through me weird living stones without dead stones where living stones brought to bring the praises of God holy you may be quiet that's fine but there should be something in you bubbling fourth parlor you may not be the most expressive person we should be a living stone to be a cosmic manifestation god you're so good Jeff cleanse me you made yourself known to me I'm alive in you I'm not dead no more being quickened Holly you've you've saved me you've loosed me from sin hallelujah and not just one time but forever and ever and ever hallelujah so a charismatic manifestation should fill the temple that's why the devil says shut up sit down don't say Amen don't raise your hands don't do nothing just sit there like a but like a dead stick you see anyone who's into anything they allowed they're excited you see you see soccer you go to South America you go to Europe do they just well Renaldo's pretty good today did you see did you see Messi do that never seen him do that before pretty good are they like that no they celebrate and they celebrate and the next day they're still celebrating you know they're still shouting and dancing and whatever more white because they're in the spirit of the game and they can sit there for hours and hours and hours and just watch a ball go nothing in soccer but you know or rugby going back and forth League whatever sport you want they can sit there watch Test match after Test match after Test match keep the score should right there with their sandwiches on the on the boundary why cuz they're in the spirit of the game and they love what they're doing because something in them is feeding on it right and the spirit in them can't get enough what about eternal things what about this God this Lord Jesus Christ you just think about it he says in John 4 the Father seek such to worship Him in spirit and truth here's the God that made everything not just the earth but everything and now it says I'm gonna seek oh my I'm gonna seek worshipers I'm gonna look for them I'm gonna start hunting over this nation in this suburb this house this place I'm gonna start hunting through ages through the Ephesian age all the way down to later I said I'm gonna seek them but God you made everything you know from from you you know from eternity to eternity you know role be this is now I'm gonna seek you because I need something to worship me that's not mechanical that's not just a form of a because they've been programmed or made he wasn't satisfied with the Angels worshiping him they would say that's incredible but he wanted something with a free moral agency that willfully gave their lives knowingly over to him and worship him out of a sincere thankful appreciative heart wholly of that out of their own choosing why you're Christian because I chose he said will you I see the hope thank you this is what I've been looking for my entire life oh my hallelujah this is this is what he's been he is seeking hell Eddie found me how to worship Him in spirit and in truth but don't leave the devil say no you've done too much wrong no you listen this and this tell them to shut up and sit down because remember the Antichrist spirit does not want God he doesn't want Holy Ghost worship to happen and because when the Lord comes down to worship then healing can happen prophecy can happen discernment can happen deliverance can happen new births can happen we can be refilled with the Holy Ghost we make change hallelujah the word can put on flesh I mean that God can mold this character into our character to make us like him oh yeah we should never put God in a box this year 2020 should be God all things are possible but all things are possible to them that believe therefore there is nothing impossible with you oh that's just motivational speaking no that's a scripture that's the scripture brother I'm said if there was not a law to stop it you could create your own private world and go live on it oh my wouldn't that be cool I'm not talking about Minecraft I don't know about something that's minecraft I don't want something real you could go build your own private world and go live on it hallelujah why because the Creator is in you if the Holy Ghost is in you the same one that made Sun Moon and stars made all things now comes and dwells in you so let's not put God in a box oh we have our order and yes sure we have Church order we could have all those things but don't put God in a box if the Holy Ghost is moving and you know it's the Lord you you should have confidence I can step out on this if you can see it in his word everything in its word you saying Lord it's mine the scripture says that he will withhold nothing from them that walk uprightly he's made us walk uprightly he's made me righteous so therefore he will not withhold anything from me and if he's put the Holy Ghost in my life I will ask according to his word it will not be selfish things Lord I want a billion trillion dollars I don't think he's you know unless he gave me the character to handle that kind of thing and I would if I had the character I would use it for his glory right but he will give you he said Lord yo if you have the mind of Christ what you pray for will be according to the scripture amen hallelujah so nothing is impossible with you little old me absolutely now it says in the ephesian church age again he said Paul saw it coming but he warned him about the subtle priesthood that would come and take over with his false doctrines he knew they would they would emblem in a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a Holy Spirit ministry he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a Holy Spirit ministry I repeated that on purpose and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom and the lighting and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sit there and tries to absorb it and even right today I say God when I read as I say Lord not here not here and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the Spirit there is not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from Paul who said that when we all come together all had the leading of the Spirit and all participated in spiritual worship we have no this is serious we have been restored to a time where as not just inspired ministers or inspired song leaders its anointed people where cuz we are all the body of Christ by one spirit we baptized into one body and the body is to operate according to the Word of God right so it should be it should be God behind the pulpit is the same God that's in the pew that's the same God that's in the deacon the same God behind the sound desk the same God behind the instruments it should be the same God operating not just are sitting here trying to grasp something but should be the same God that speaking is the same God receiving in the people I'm in the same god that's anointed to speak I mean the same God and the preacher should be the same God in the pew hallelujah that's how it should be we want to be when we come together that's why brother Brahim said when when John he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day revelations chapter 1 he says if you want to do anything first get in the spirit get in the spirit first then do what you gonna do don't just go through the order of it no get in the spoon get under the anointing of the Holy Ghost say God come and live in me I want to get in the spirit you want to read the word and actually catch something get in the spirit just like when you hear the message get in the spirit say Lord hallelujah well how do you do that they were gathered in the upper room all praying in is there one of them one of them that's why the devil doesn't want us to sing he doesn't want us to clap her hands he doesn't want us to be free do you know my heart's desire as we stay like a man beating a tambourine on a street corner I say Lord may we stay like that all there's no substance to it hey sure amen the disciples in the book of Acts I went from house to house they had liberty God lives wherever they were we don't want to say oh we've arrived no when when when this body changes we've arrived right but right now we're on our way and if we're on our way there's more promises to possess there's more land to take I mean there's more work to fulfill I mean so we should keep pressing the battle amen until where we have received everything that God wants to give us as now in our position police will never ever let the devil try and rob you I'm in the same Holy Ghost that was on the Lord Jesus should be upon you I am in the same worship tub yeah I'm in the apostles hat you should have it as well where God comes down you say we don't believe in gifts no more why why not it's part of the word I meant there's a gift of the sermon it's part of the word gift of knowledge part of the word thanks prophecy it's all part of the word I mean if we sing let's sing in the spirit if we pray let's pray in the spirit I'm looking with some great big rush no just open your heart say Lord you lovely you saved me you wash me you've cleans me I'm so glad Jesus lifted me I'm so I don't care I don't think Jesus lifted me I'm so glad Jesus lifted me singing glory hallelujah Jesus lifted me now I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory singing glory hallelujah Jesus set me free well Satan had me bound but Jesus set me free Satan had me bound but Jesus set me free Satan had me bound but Jesus set me free singing glory hallelujah Jesus set me free hallelujah onion glad hey man it should be the anointing should be upon the people how they should be I believe the people should be more anointed of the minister why because then it should be the only reason that the words any good is because it should be given you I've pulling on that word here's my cup fill it up feed me God pour in your word and Spyro ever speaking I don't care who does I want to hear from you Holly then what happens oh I got a thought all this happened or God inspired why because there's a pull in the congregation but what was the devil do don't do that just just dress right act right you're going to say Lord how do you pull Lord speak to my heart just be sincere you don't need some great big flowery prayer it's not about it's not about what you say it's how you say it what I need you speak to my life come deal with me what I read about in here Lord I want to hear I want to see it live hallelujah but I'm on my way to heaven let's have the musician shall we shouting victory I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory singing glory hallelujah Jesus set me free hallelujah no we've got to understand being set free doesn't mean we're carefree we're gonna have troubles we're gonna have burdens we're gonna have things but that doesn't mean you're bound hallelujah the Apostles had the government in the religious world to push them down but they're free they had those worries things going on around them but they were rejoicing shouting victory why because they were they were dead but now they're alive they're being quickened from the dead hallelujah that was dead but now didn't respond since but now they're free and Jesus Christ said never ever let go he said the devil's fighting me that's good because you have something he has you have something sorry you have something he wants and you're not giving it to him yes I been contested every day that's good keep pressing the battle remember in heavenly armor we've entered the land Joshua fought a lot of battles breath but God said be strong they're very courageous don't be dismayed why did God say that because there be times when he would have felt us mate don't be dismayed be strong and very courageous probably with the river thou goest and as as God was with Joshua that same God is with you I mean that you would possess every promise in this hour amen let's they stand shall we I want I want everyone to I don't just want us to sit and try and grasp things gonna be spiritual worship that we'd be a spirit-filled Church from the oldest to the youngest it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do against us we're rejoicing I mean we enable off of that lamb the blood of the Lamb came upon him
