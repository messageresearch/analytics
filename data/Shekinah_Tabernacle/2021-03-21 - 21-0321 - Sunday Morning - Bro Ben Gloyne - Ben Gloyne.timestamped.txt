[51:18] i want to speak about the effects of
[51:21] those who sit at his table
[51:23] because there's an effect there's a real
[51:26] effect hallelujah it's not just an
[51:27] intellectual learning and absorbing
[51:29] information but there's a reality that
[51:31] comes into a person's life and
[51:33] so so david would say here thou prepare
[51:35] us a table before me in the presence of
[51:37] mine enemies
[51:38] thou anoint us my head with oil my cup
[51:41] runneth over

[52:57] grant it for your glory lord in jesus
[52:59] christ's name amen
[53:01] amen god bless you friends you may have
[53:02] your seats so
[53:04] as i was saying a lot to continue on
[53:06] from from
[53:07] from wednesday and the effects of uh
[53:10] sitting at his table now brother braham
[53:13] says in the sermon the mighty god
[53:14] unveiled before us in 1964
[53:17] he says since the holy ghost has come in
[53:19] this last days is prophesied and the
[53:21] veil has been rent
[53:23] too many people try to hang on to their
[53:25] traditions of the fathers
[53:27] and that's why they can't see this
[53:30] extreme
[53:30] joy and peace and the things that the
[53:33] church has today
[53:35] yet it's been made yet it's in plain
[53:38] view
[53:38] to those who believe so there's an
[53:40] actual effect that the word should have
[53:42] in our lives you know it should produce
[53:44] we know the life of jesus christ and us
[53:46] you know it should
[53:47] you know there's a transforming power in
[53:48] the word that'll change us from glory to
[53:50] glory but
[53:51] you know but there should be an effect i
[53:53] believe of
[53:54] someone who feeds at the table of the
[53:56] lord there should be an effect in our
[53:57] lives there should be a
[53:58] an influence that you know changes us
[54:01] and molds us
[54:01] and you know i just want to say this
[54:03] morning you know we're here to sit at
[54:04] the table of the lord
[54:05] we're not here to have religion this is
[54:07] not about religion if you want religion
[54:08] you've come to the wrong church
[54:10] i mean but here's we are here to have a
[54:11] real relationship with jesus christ
[54:13] that we would know him in the power of
[54:16] of his resurrection
[54:17] and david you know i love i love david
[54:20] incredible kind of man very you could
[54:22] say unusual kind of man
[54:23] even for his day where he would have
[54:25] such a longing for god no matter how
[54:27] much god had done in his life how much
[54:29] god had lived in his life
[54:30] he always wanted more and i believe that
[54:33] is just really a representation of who
[54:34] we are as people you know we've seen god
[54:36] do so much i mean he's done incredible
[54:39] things in our lives he's opened his word
[54:40] made his covenant so real to us and
[54:43] transformed us and renewed us and saved
[54:45] us but yet we want more of him
[54:46] amen and we need more of him in this day
[54:48] you know this is a day of formality it's
[54:50] a day of great emotionalism
[54:52] you know but there's a reality in the
[54:53] word of god that goes beyond emotion
[54:55] goes beyond formality
[54:57] goes beyond tradition you know that will
[54:59] actually you know
[55:00] get a hold of our lives and change us
[55:02] now what i love about being called to
[55:05] the table of the lord is it does not
[55:06] matter the state we started
[55:09] david would come to a spot in his life
[55:11] when he was established as king over
[55:13] israel
[55:13] and he then he remembered the covenant
[55:15] he made with his friend jonathan
[55:17] and he began to inquire through the
[55:19] kingdom are there any of jonathan's
[55:21] children alive
[55:22] and and and it was heard you know and it
[55:24] was reported back to him yes there's a
[55:26] mephibosheth
[55:27] who who is who is far away somewhere in
[55:30] the kingdom and david says call
[55:31] him call him here because he wanted him
[55:34] to sit at his table and
[55:35] yeah mephibosheth we know was was
[55:37] jonathan's son he was the house of saul
[55:39] which was the enemies of david and
[55:41] you know so no doubt mephibosheth he did
[55:43] come with great fear and trembling
[55:45] thinking that david was going to kill
[55:46] him because you know mephibosheth was
[55:48] the rightful heir to the throne
[55:50] but david wasn't interested in killing
[55:52] mephibosheth he wanted mephibosheth
[55:54] at david's table and the scripture tells
[55:57] us we were once the enemies of god you
[55:58] know we were we were contrary to his
[56:00] ways our nature was contrary to his
[56:02] nature
[56:03] but he didn't want us to stay in that
[56:05] state he wanted us to sit at his table
[56:07] to dine at his guests
[56:08] i mean to partake of his goodness
[56:10] hallelujah so mephibosheth is called now
[56:13] this mephibosheth
[56:14] we know the scripture tells us in in
[56:16] second samuel four and four
[56:19] and jonathan saul's son had a son that
[56:21] was lame of his feet
[56:23] he was five years old when the tidings
[56:25] came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel
[56:28] and his nurse took him up and fled and
[56:31] it came to pass as she made haste to
[56:33] flee
[56:34] then he fell and became lame and his
[56:36] name was mephibosheth so
[56:38] here is a man that has been affected by
[56:40] something from his childhood
[56:42] it was not something he did he did not
[56:43] plan to you know become lame it was what
[56:46] was going on in his parents life that
[56:48] actually caused him to become a
[56:51] and many things can happen in our lives
[56:52] have i got to have i got everyone's
[56:54] attention just now
[56:55] you know because we can be living under
[56:57] the influence of something that's not
[56:58] our fault not even our plans our you
[57:01] know it can be our family the church
[57:02] something going on
[57:03] and can cause us to be crippled in a
[57:05] certain way that hinders our walk but
[57:08] i'm so thankful that god doesn't want us
[57:10] to live under the influence of our past
[57:12] he wants us to live under the influence
[57:14] of our future now what is our future
[57:15] well we're going to the streets of gold
[57:17] we're going to be dancing on the streets
[57:18] of gold through eternity hallelujah when
[57:20] the devil is no more we
[57:22] still shall be hallelujah i trust god's
[57:25] made that real to you
[57:26] amen that you've got a heaven to go to
[57:28] and a hell you're not going to
[57:29] amen you're not even called to go to the
[57:31] great white throne judgment amen this
[57:32] message has been sent
[57:34] hardly that a people will not go and
[57:35] stand before the great white throne
[57:37] judgment but they will go
[57:38] hallelujah up until eternity and they
[57:40] will actually sit with christ and judge
[57:42] the world
[57:42] i'm sorry if i'm talking too fast this
[57:44] is how it is today
[57:46] hallelujah just replay the video on half
[57:48] speed maybe you know
[57:50] but mephibosheth was was afraid
[57:54] but david wasn't interested in killing
[57:56] him he wasn't looking for revenge you
[57:58] know our god is not angry at us
[58:01] you know the reason he corrects us is to
[58:02] keep us on the road
[58:04] he doesn't set us up to fail he sets us
[58:07] up to be victorious
[58:09] hallelujah so he's not angry you know
[58:11] many people are afraid that god's just
[58:13] going to get sick of them and throw them
[58:14] away
[58:15] who's ever had that feeling oh yeah many
[58:18] times think lord you should have thrown
[58:19] me in the bin someplace and just that's
[58:21] it yeah
[58:21] i've yeah i've had enough with you
[58:24] you're done
[58:25] now god's not that way he can't change
[58:27] his mind about his
[58:28] his children hallelujah you can't change
[58:30] his mind about his word
[58:32] hallelujah so here comes mephibosheth
[58:34] now he's he's he's under fear and
[58:36] trembling
[58:36] and he comes in and this is in second
[58:38] samuel nine and six and then when
[58:40] mephibosheth the son of jonathan
[58:42] the son of saul was come unto david he
[58:44] fell on his face ended reverence and
[58:46] david said mephibosheth
[58:47] he answered behold thy servant and david
[58:50] said unto him fear not
[58:52] how how many times does an angel or
[58:54] someone come you know god comes to a
[58:56] people says fear not
[58:58] amen we don't need to be afraid fear not
[59:00] for i will surely show thee kindness for
[59:02] jonathan thy father's sake
[59:04] and will restore thee all the land of
[59:06] saul thy father and thou
[59:07] shall eat bread at my table continually
[59:10] and bowed him and he bowed himself down
[59:12] said what is thy servant that thou
[59:14] should just look upon such a dead dog
[59:16] such as i am
[59:18] so this is what mephibosheth thought
[59:20] himself as i'm just a dead dog
[59:22] but but you know the people at the
[59:24] king's table are honored people
[59:27] harley and it's the king's invitation
[59:28] that makes them worthy to sit at the
[59:30] table
[59:30] it's not their worthiness not their
[59:32] prestige or their honor or what they
[59:34] know who they are
[59:35] no it's it's it's the king's commandment
[59:38] i've got a wedding supper feast
[59:40] i'm going to call the people it doesn't
[59:42] matter how they're physical
[59:43] maybe crippled or whatever more forget
[59:45] all those things
[59:46] you know we we pander so much to
[59:49] complexes and pains and hurts and bad
[59:51] memories and trouble and
[59:52] forget that thing i mean because
[59:54] there'll come a time where they won't
[59:55] even be a memory anymore
[59:57] oh there god doesn't worry about our
[59:58] physical state he's he's worried about
[1:00:00] our spiritual state what's the condition
[1:00:02] of our soul today
[1:00:04] amen is it being washed in the blood of
[1:00:05] the lamb do you really know him the
[1:00:06] power
[1:00:07] of his resurrection that's what he's
[1:00:09] interested in i mean because god is
[1:00:11] looking for his
[1:00:12] seed he's looking for his children and
[1:00:15] he can't lose one of them
[1:00:17] hallelujah amen so here he was
[1:00:21] mephibosheth was called and so so
[1:00:24] mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem
[1:00:26] for he didn't eat continually at the
[1:00:28] king's table
[1:00:29] and was lame on both his feet now i want
[1:00:32] to ask you a question
[1:00:34] when you see people sitting around a
[1:00:35] table do you see their feet if there's a
[1:00:38] you know a
[1:00:39] tablecloth there can you see their
[1:00:41] physical condition
[1:00:43] they all sitting they all look the same
[1:00:45] so you couldn't see
[1:00:47] you couldn't see mephibosheth's lameness
[1:00:49] in his feet
[1:00:50] because he was sitting at the table of
[1:00:52] the lord he looked like every well-body
[1:00:54] person there
[1:00:56] i mean and we're called to sit at the
[1:00:57] lord's table i mean he actually
[1:00:59] covers he doesn't just hide our
[1:01:01] infirmities or our physical failings
[1:01:03] but he changes them by the power of his
[1:01:05] blood you know our body's gonna be
[1:01:06] changed one day
[1:01:08] hallelujah so we can't if we're called
[1:01:10] then the lord covers actually
[1:01:13] these things that we hold so much
[1:01:14] against ourselves
[1:01:16] hallelujah now this is just a physical
[1:01:18] ailment how much more a spiritual
[1:01:20] ailment that's not just covered but
[1:01:21] taken away by the blood of jesus christ
[1:01:24] i mean so mephibosheth was called and he
[1:01:26] looked like all the same
[1:01:27] as you're all the same as all the other
[1:01:30] guests
[1:01:31] hallelujah remember he was called
[1:01:34] because of who he was he was the son of
[1:01:37] jonathan
[1:01:38] that's why he was called you know we are
[1:01:40] the children of the most high god
[1:01:43] you know this you know there's such a
[1:01:44] wrestle there's such a wrestle today
[1:01:46] about identity
[1:01:47] what's our identity even this country is
[1:01:49] going through a great identity change
[1:01:51] you know for good awful bad you know but
[1:01:53] you know there's great a big challenge
[1:01:54] what's your identity and i've come to
[1:01:57] the realization
[1:01:58] my identity is in the word of god amen
[1:02:01] this message is my identity this message
[1:02:04] called me
[1:02:05] it said brother brown said the
[1:02:06] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:02:08] this
[1:02:09] he says i'm i may not do it but this
[1:02:11] message will introduce jesus christ to
[1:02:13] the world
[1:02:14] and that's what happened to me i didn't
[1:02:15] meet a doctrine i didn't meet a church i
[1:02:17] met the lord jesus christ himself
[1:02:19] highly transformed my life so what he
[1:02:21] said would happen happened to me
[1:02:23] i mean to my identities in christ it's
[1:02:25] not in anything else
[1:02:27] hallelujah i may speak like a kiwi act
[1:02:28] like a kiwi you know look like a kiwi
[1:02:30] but i'm not a kiwi
[1:02:32] i'm a christian hallelujah isn't that
[1:02:34] right our identity is in christ
[1:02:37] amen so mephibosheth's identity was to
[1:02:41] be at the king's table that's where he
[1:02:42] was ordained to be that's where he
[1:02:44] should have been hallelujah and that's
[1:02:45] where he ended up
[1:02:46] amen hallelujah and this is
[1:02:49] it's the same thing with us who's been
[1:02:51] called to sit at his table
[1:02:53] now so there's not just the effect of
[1:02:55] covering any physical failures
[1:02:58] hallelujah but there's an anointing that
[1:02:59] comes because he said
[1:03:02] you know you sit he sets a table before
[1:03:04] me in the prince of my enemies
[1:03:05] then he anointeth my head and my cup
[1:03:07] runneth over so there's an
[1:03:09] effect of being at this table now
[1:03:11] there's a vast difference between
[1:03:13] intellectually learning the word
[1:03:15] that actually being under being under
[1:03:17] the inspiration of the word
[1:03:18] and feeding on it spiritually they can
[1:03:21] look the same you can read the same
[1:03:22] bible hear the same message
[1:03:24] but it's got to be inspired to you that
[1:03:26] the same inspiration that was spoken in

[1:05:48] ever
[1:05:49] amen amen so this this word for he
[1:05:52] careth for you
[1:05:53] it means to be of interest to that is to
[1:05:56] concern
[1:05:57] so he he has an interest in us he's
[1:06:00] concerned about us
[1:06:02] now that concern goes far deeper than
[1:06:05] just worry about how we are
[1:06:07] even though that's part of it you know
[1:06:09] the lord wants us to be happy
[1:06:11] do you know that we he he wants us to be
[1:06:12] happy christians you know to be a
[1:06:14] message believe is not a long hair long
[1:06:16] skirt long frown
[1:06:18] let's be joy unspeakable full of glory
[1:06:21] right he wants us to be happy brother
[1:06:23] braham says this he says
[1:06:24] um from uh it's not so from the
[1:06:26] beginning
[1:06:27] he says now find them on the mission
[1:06:29] field starve to death almost i've seen
[1:06:32] them with no shoes on their feet living
[1:06:34] off
[1:06:34] about 30 cents a week preaching the
[1:06:36] gospel brother
[1:06:37] just as happy as you are coming in a
[1:06:40] limousine
[1:06:41] they are happy for they found something
[1:06:44] that means more than creed or
[1:06:46] no or denomination or church affiliation
[1:06:48] they
[1:06:49] found what it takes to bring joy and a
[1:06:51] christian should be happy
[1:06:53] we were prayed for that our joys might
[1:06:56] be full
[1:06:57] i mean there's something about that
[1:06:58] that's real
[1:07:00] hallelujah so you know so jesus would
[1:07:03] say as the father hath loved me
[1:07:05] so i have loved you continue in my love
[1:07:08] if you keep my commandments
[1:07:09] you shall abide in my love even as i
[1:07:11] have kept my
[1:07:12] father's commandments and abide and
[1:07:15] abide in his love these things have i
[1:07:17] spoken
[1:07:18] unto you that joy that my joy might
[1:07:21] remain in you and that your joy
[1:07:23] might be full he says now if you've lost
[1:07:26] that joy
[1:07:27] if we have lost those things we can't
[1:07:30] find them among our kindreds we can't
[1:07:32] find them
[1:07:32] then there's one thing to do is to go
[1:07:34] back where we left them at
[1:07:36] the church should go back to the
[1:07:37] beginning where they left and that's
[1:07:38] exactly what mary and joseph did
[1:07:40] they left jesus at the feast of
[1:07:42] pentecost that's where mary and joseph
[1:07:45] left jesus so we need to if you if
[1:07:47] you've lost your joy go back and get it
[1:07:49] wherever you've left him go back to
[1:07:51] wherever you found him now to me when he
[1:07:52] speak about the feast of pentecost
[1:07:54] to me this is speaking when the holy
[1:07:56] ghost first came so he's saying go
[1:07:58] back to where he first met you i mean go
[1:08:02] back through your testimony to where he
[1:08:04] first met you and build from there again
[1:08:06] that doesn't mean you tear down
[1:08:07] everything else he did for you but go
[1:08:09] back to where you met your first love
[1:08:11] and you fell in love with him and you'll
[1:08:13] get your joy back i mean then you'll get
[1:08:15] your peace back amen because the same
[1:08:16] god that called you
[1:08:18] can't lose you he's gonna keep you
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:21] amen so that's where he's saying go back
[1:08:23] where you first met him
[1:08:24] where he touched your life and put a
[1:08:26] desire in your heart to serve him
[1:08:29] do you know we can walk above criticism
[1:08:32] do you know we can walk above
[1:08:34] fearing what other people think of us i
[1:08:37] mean if our focus is on the right thing
[1:08:39] we can actually walk above what other
[1:08:41] people think
[1:08:41] or misunderstandings what other people
[1:08:43] think we can walk above criticism
[1:08:45] we can walk above you know what everyone
[1:08:47] else is doing
[1:08:48] and we can worship god out of a pure
[1:08:50] heart hallelujah
[1:08:52] you know david as i said was an
[1:08:53] incredible man unusual for his day but
[1:08:56] an incredible
[1:08:57] you know incredible man he had a longing
[1:08:59] to see god live
[1:09:00] above all things he had it all he was
[1:09:02] king over the whole nation
[1:09:04] i mean but but he wanted more those
[1:09:06] things didn't really satisfy him as much
[1:09:08] as god living in his life
[1:09:10] and he would come to a place where he
[1:09:11] desired that the ark would be returned
[1:09:13] to his city
[1:09:14] now here he comes to a spot where the
[1:09:16] ark is returning and you know he just
[1:09:18] got a little bit excited
[1:09:19] remember when he would write psalms 23
[1:09:21] he sets a table before me in the prince
[1:09:23] of my enemies
[1:09:24] and then he anointed my head but with
[1:09:26] joy my cup runneth over
[1:09:28] you know he experienced that it wasn't
[1:09:30] something that he just wrote down that
[1:09:31] sounded good
[1:09:32] i mean but he really experienced that so
[1:09:34] he knew what it was like to be anointed
[1:09:36] by god
[1:09:36] and his cup to run over i mean the thing
[1:09:39] is when cups run over people criticize
[1:09:41] people look at that in a sideways way
[1:09:42] and say well you're just too happy
[1:09:44] you're just too fanatical
[1:09:45] you're just going off the deep end i
[1:09:46] tell you what depends where the swimming
[1:09:48] waters is at
[1:09:49] i mean i like to do a cannonball into a
[1:09:51] deep end hallelujah
[1:09:52] that's a good place to be i mean the
[1:09:53] shallow end you can jump in and break
[1:09:55] your neck i don't want to break my neck
[1:09:56] i want to swim in the deepness of god
[1:09:58] not just the shallow bits but the
[1:09:59] deepness of god others so david would
[1:10:02] see the ark coming back and he just got
[1:10:03] a little bit excited
[1:10:05] and then he began to dance and it wasn't
[1:10:07] necessary choreographed but he didn't
[1:10:08] care so much because
[1:10:10] he wasn't worshiping to entertain the
[1:10:12] people around him
[1:10:13] he was worshiping his god because the
[1:10:15] ark was coming
[1:10:16] down into the city into his own city not
[1:10:19] to someone else's city but into his city
[1:10:21] he began to dance and rejoice
[1:10:22] and he wasn't caring what it looked like
[1:10:24] he didn't say hold on is this okay he
[1:10:26] didn't care
[1:10:27] he was what his cup was running over
[1:10:30] hallelujah and he was rejoicing but
[1:10:32] there was someone there that didn't
[1:10:33] really enjoy it
[1:10:35] there was a king's daughter who looked
[1:10:38] out of the palace window
[1:10:39] she wasn't part of the worship she was
[1:10:41] just a spectator don't be a spectator
[1:10:44] don't be a spectator sure you can get
[1:10:46] the same t-shirt you know a lot of
[1:10:47] people bought team new zealand t-shirts
[1:10:50] but they're just spectators on the side
[1:10:51] and they wrote blogs and things how they
[1:10:53] should do what they should have done all
[1:10:54] about the america's cup they weren't on
[1:10:55] the water
[1:10:57] they were just spectators hallelujah i
[1:10:59] don't want to be a spectator in this one
[1:11:01] that was just for an
[1:11:02] old mug hallelujah this is for a crown
[1:11:04] of life we're talking about now
[1:11:06] i mean so i don't just want to be a
[1:11:07] spectator while they should do this and
[1:11:09] this is how it should be here and this
[1:11:10] and that no no
[1:11:12] get on board hallelujah so there's the
[1:11:14] king's daughter which was the daughter
[1:11:16] of saul
[1:11:17] and she looked out the window and she
[1:11:20] just had a critical
[1:11:21] spirit on her many times we think
[1:11:24] discernment is criticism or criticism is
[1:11:27] discernment no it's not
[1:11:28] because if it is discernment god will
[1:11:30] give you the answer how to fix it
[1:11:32] hallelujah it's easy to point out wrong
[1:11:34] here i am
[1:11:36] you know if you want you know if you
[1:11:37] came here for saying to criticize
[1:11:39] i think i've got given you enough
[1:11:40] material for for a few months
[1:11:43] you know but you know but if you've come
[1:11:45] to see god
[1:11:47] then you'll get your reward hallelujah i
[1:11:49] mean so she
[1:11:50] she you know she felt embarrassed
[1:11:52] because what her husband was doing
[1:11:54] i mean but she was a king's daughter
[1:11:56] show she was sitting in a place of
[1:11:58] privilege
[1:11:59] but she did not understand that place
[1:12:01] what that place meant
[1:12:02] i mean if she really knew what that
[1:12:04] place meant she would be dancing too
[1:12:06] because the ark wasn't just coming into
[1:12:08] david city it was her city
[1:12:10] here was that ark that was you know out
[1:12:11] with the philistines different places
[1:12:13] now it had been returned
[1:12:15] hallelujah and davis dancing she got
[1:12:17] offended by it
[1:12:19] but then did this stop david from
[1:12:21] dancing there should be nothing that
[1:12:23] stops our dance
[1:12:24] there should be nothing that stops our
[1:12:25] walk sure there'll be things that try
[1:12:27] and stop it
[1:12:28] to him that overcometh hallelujah will i
[1:12:30] grant to sit in my throne as i sat there
[1:12:32] to my father's throne so
[1:12:33] criticisms are something we've got to
[1:12:35] overcome how the coldness that comes
[1:12:37] into the church we've got to overcome it
[1:12:39] you know we had um i think it was
[1:12:41] brother andrew glover here
[1:12:42] whenever that was i was sitting down the
[1:12:44] back i found a coldness coming to the
[1:12:46] church during that service
[1:12:48] i refused to be subjected to it i
[1:12:50] started praising god and drawing and i
[1:12:52] and then i had a glorious time
[1:12:55] hallelujah
[1:12:56] that was true sitting back there so you
[1:12:59] know we shouldn't just say you know
[1:13:00] we're not called just to be
[1:13:02] thermos temperature gauges we're called
[1:13:05] to be thermostats
[1:13:07] if it gets cold turn up the heat it
[1:13:09] can't get too hot either by the way so
[1:13:10] don't turn it down
[1:13:12] you know but we should just be reactive
[1:13:14] to the atmosphere around us
[1:13:16] we should be reactive to what's in us
[1:13:17] the revelation that's in us that's how
[1:13:19] we should be reacting
[1:13:20] just like david he wasn't dancing
[1:13:22] because everyone else was happy there's
[1:13:23] a revelation coming forth
[1:13:25] hallelujah was the mercy seat coming
[1:13:27] into a city hallelujah he was the prince
[1:13:29] of god coming into a city
[1:13:30] and he was rejoicing amen and i will
[1:13:33] restore brother brahm says i'm so glad
[1:13:36] that i can say i'm one of them by the
[1:13:37] grace of god wouldn't swap it for
[1:13:39] nothing in the world oh sure
[1:13:41] they call me this that or the other that
[1:13:44] don't make any difference
[1:13:45] what they call me god calls me his son
[1:13:48] amen that's the main thing amen that's
[1:13:51] the main thing
[1:13:51] i see that little old girl that time
[1:13:54] david's wife
[1:13:54] that hid behind her fan fanning like
[1:13:56] that and she thought david her sweet
[1:13:58] sweetheart was the cutest thing
[1:14:01] but when the ark come in and david saw
[1:14:02] it and a revival was in session
[1:14:05] little old david went down there and
[1:14:06] danced around the ark as hard as he
[1:14:08] could go
[1:14:08] why she said you embarrass me my well
[1:14:11] i'll have the general counsel to put you
[1:14:13] out why you embarrass me
[1:14:15] see it's easy really if you want to see
[1:14:17] if you're looking at a future spouse
[1:14:18] somewhere
[1:14:19] see how they react in the presence of
[1:14:21] god
[1:14:22] right because sure she thought david was
[1:14:24] wonderful but when he got anointed
[1:14:27] really hurt her true feelings came out
[1:14:30] i mean so so if you're looking for a
[1:14:32] future spouse look how they are in the
[1:14:34] presence of god
[1:14:35] not just talking about the word and
[1:14:37] being religious but what happens when
[1:14:38] they get under the influence of the holy
[1:14:40] ghost
[1:14:41] and then you'll see their true selves
[1:14:42] come out
[1:14:44] hallelujah why oh see i'll put you out
[1:14:48] the next general counsel why you
[1:14:49] embarrass me he said if you don't like
[1:14:51] that
[1:14:52] watch this and down he went and around
[1:14:54] and around and around and around on the
[1:14:55] arc he went rejoicing happy
[1:14:57] shouting praising god and rejoicing
[1:14:59] hallelujah if you don't like that then
[1:15:01] watch this
[1:15:02] hallelujah and that should be and then
[1:15:04] god looked down from heaven
[1:15:05] and said david you're a man after my own
[1:15:07] heart hallelujah so
[1:15:08] don't make any difference what the world
[1:15:10] says it's what god says
[1:15:12] amen hallelujah that's how we should be
[1:15:15] we can live he lived above criticism
[1:15:18] under the blood of balls and goats how
[1:15:19] much more you know david
[1:15:22] he had such a longing in his heart but
[1:15:24] it couldn't be fully expressed under the
[1:15:26] blood of bulls and goats
[1:15:28] hallelujah because god could just be
[1:15:29] with him but not actually in them
[1:15:31] but now under the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:34] the longing he had
[1:15:35] can be satisfied in you and i brother
[1:15:38] brown speaks about it and spoken word is
[1:15:39] the original seed
[1:15:40] he said he had a longing but he wasn't
[1:15:42] the right moisture to bring it to life
[1:15:44] amen but here could you imagine what
[1:15:46] david would be like in this day
[1:15:48] could you imagine how he would have been
[1:15:50] hallelujah he would tear this place up
[1:15:53] hallelujah he'd be rejoicing
[1:15:56] why are you so happy david can't you see
[1:15:58] what you've got
[1:15:59] can't you see what you have right now
[1:16:01] holy can't you see that god dwells in
[1:16:03] you and you're the temple of the living
[1:16:05] god
[1:16:05] more than under a tent more than a
[1:16:07] temple of stone but in flesh
[1:16:09] can't you see what you have you're about
[1:16:10] to go on a rapture how are you about to
[1:16:12] be translated from this world to the
[1:16:14] next world
[1:16:15] can't you see what you've got you've got
[1:16:16] overcoming power to overcome this first
[1:16:19] birth that you're born with
[1:16:20] this carnal nature hallelujah can't you
[1:16:23] see what you have right now
[1:16:24] can't you see what you have you have
[1:16:26] power to overcome this world
[1:16:27] i mean overcome every demon of hell all
[1:16:30] torment all of your past your pain
[1:16:32] whatever it may be
[1:16:33] this is what you have and this is why
[1:16:35] david would have been rejoicing can't
[1:16:36] you see
[1:16:37] what you have right now hallelujah we
[1:16:40] have power to overcome all temptation
[1:16:43] all trials all hardship all trouble
[1:16:47] all sin all the problem with the flesh
[1:16:49] whatever it may be we have power right
[1:16:51] now by the blood of jesus christ by the
[1:16:53] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:55] we have power to overcome all things
[1:16:58] harley that's why he would have been
[1:17:00] dancing
[1:17:02] hallelujah amen
[1:17:06] you know they long to live in this day
[1:17:08] the scripture says the prophets of old
[1:17:10] day long
[1:17:11] to live in this day and god said to them
[1:17:14] no it's not for you
[1:17:16] you can be there but these people are
[1:17:17] going to be here
[1:17:19] hallelujah and here we are you know so
[1:17:20] amazing all of the hardship and the
[1:17:23] trouble and the burdens of the saints
[1:17:24] down through the ages
[1:17:25] and we just reap the benefits of it
[1:17:28] hallelujah isn't it incredible
[1:17:30] hallelujah praise the lord and if they
[1:17:33] could overcome in their day
[1:17:34] great obstacles great trouble we can as
[1:17:37] well
[1:17:38] and we will hallelujah
[1:17:42] amen david would come to a spot where he
[1:17:44] you know
[1:17:45] took bathsheba and did those things and
[1:17:47] he you know
[1:17:48] two years later the prophet came and
[1:17:50] exposed that sin in his life
[1:17:53] and he would say restore unto me the joy
[1:17:55] of thy salvation
[1:17:56] and uphold me with thy free spirit so
[1:17:59] the joy
[1:18:00] it wasn't the joy of david's salvation
[1:18:02] that he wanted restoring but the joy of
[1:18:04] god's salvation
[1:18:05] you know that the word if we're not
[1:18:07] careful can become common
[1:18:09] it can just become like a like
[1:18:11] information i've heard that before i've
[1:18:13] heard that quote before i've heard that
[1:18:14] scripture before
[1:18:16] i've sung that yeah we've sung that song
[1:18:17] before we've done it in that way before
[1:18:19] but that you know it can just become the
[1:18:21] joy leaves
[1:18:23] but we can keep that joy hallelujah
[1:18:26] we may sing the same song every week it
[1:18:28] can just mean more to you every time
[1:18:31] that same quote can mean a lot more to
[1:18:32] you every time that same scripture can
[1:18:34] mean a lot more why because there's a
[1:18:35] joy in the word
[1:18:37] holy there should be a joy in being a
[1:18:39] christian
[1:18:40] this is not a walk of drudgery sure
[1:18:42] there's trouble there's hardship you
[1:18:44] know sure there's all those things
[1:18:46] but there should be such a joy on the
[1:18:48] inside of the inside
[1:18:49] i'm going in a rapture hallelujah this
[1:18:52] is all going to be okay
[1:18:54] hallelujah we should have joy
[1:18:55] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:18:57] amen hallelujah
[1:19:02] amen you know
[1:19:05] we have something that overcomes
[1:19:09] remember the lord has already overcome
[1:19:10] all our troubles we're going through
[1:19:12] right now
[1:19:12] he or the god in you has already
[1:19:14] overcome all things
[1:19:16] amen you know you know what i love about
[1:19:18] god i'll just
[1:19:20] go back to here our god has got
[1:19:22] everywhere
[1:19:24] when when when syria would come and
[1:19:26] attack um
[1:19:28] attack israel and this was under king
[1:19:29] ahab's that kind of blew my mind in
[1:19:31] itself
[1:19:32] um they fought a battle in the valley
[1:19:35] and
[1:19:36] israel won in the valley and syria said
[1:19:39] well because they're because their god
[1:19:40] is god in the valley
[1:19:41] will replace all of our soldiers and
[1:19:43] we'll fight them in the mountains
[1:19:45] and they and the israelites one in the
[1:19:47] mountains as well
[1:19:48] so here's victorious in the valley and
[1:19:50] he's victorious in the mountains
[1:19:51] you know he was god in a whale's belly
[1:19:54] he heard the prayers of jonah
[1:19:56] hallelujah so so he was god under the
[1:19:59] ocean with jonah
[1:20:00] amen and he was god on top of the ocean
[1:20:02] walking on the water
[1:20:04] he was a god in the storm on the ocean
[1:20:06] with the disciples and with paul
[1:20:09] he was god in the furnace with the three
[1:20:10] hebrew children
[1:20:12] i'm just laying out different places
[1:20:13] where he's god amen
[1:20:15] he was god an alliance then with daniel
[1:20:19] he was god in prison with paul and silas
[1:20:22] hallelujah he was god on death row with
[1:20:24] peter
[1:20:26] peter was on death row the next morning
[1:20:27] he was going to be executed he was god
[1:20:29] with peter on death right
[1:20:30] hallelujah he was he was god in the
[1:20:33] stalemate between
[1:20:35] israel and the philistines with david
[1:20:36] and goliath there could be a
[1:20:38] stalemate in our lives he's god in that
[1:20:40] stalemate that stalemate's got to come
[1:20:42] to an end
[1:20:43] holy we're going to keep pushing the
[1:20:44] battle i mean don't just give up because
[1:20:46] the first day
[1:20:47] there's no answer amen keep pressing on
[1:20:50] he was god in the desert
[1:20:52] he was god in egypt he was god on mount
[1:20:54] carmel
[1:20:56] hallelujah hallelujah he's even got it
[1:20:58] 32 000 feet
[1:21:00] yes that's right amen my new
[1:21:02] brother-in-law i can't get any more
[1:21:04] um you know jimmy he had a supernatural
[1:21:07] experience flying from chile to new
[1:21:08] zealand at 32 000 feet in a plane
[1:21:11] was a different person from the person
[1:21:13] that bought the plane to the person that
[1:21:14] got off the plane god changed his life
[1:21:16] at 32 000 feet he's got in the house
[1:21:20] hallelujah amen he's got everywhere
[1:21:24] so whatever situation you find yourself
[1:21:26] in he's god
[1:21:28] he's god hallelujah amen hallelujah so
[1:21:31] we don't need to worry about anything
[1:21:33] amen amen he is god everywhere now
[1:21:37] we have something as i said we have a
[1:21:39] power by the holy ghost
[1:21:41] to overcome all things
[1:21:45] some people say well i just can't go
[1:21:48] back to my first love
[1:21:49] they may not say it like this but their
[1:21:51] actions prove it
[1:21:53] but there is never anything that cannot
[1:21:55] be redeemed
[1:21:57] david came to a spot
[1:22:00] he came to a lot of places good times
[1:22:03] bad times he was a man after god's own
[1:22:05] heart
[1:22:06] just because god had made a covenant
[1:22:08] with david that he would be king
[1:22:10] did not mean his walk would be easy
[1:22:12] remember faith does not make things easy
[1:22:14] but it makes it possible
[1:22:16] hallelujah so david was anointed to
[1:22:18] become king i saw a picture i think
[1:22:21] of facebook or somewhere there's a
[1:22:23] diagram of this is how people's
[1:22:25] people think their walk should be just
[1:22:26] going like this you know
[1:22:28] but god's view it's up and down and
[1:22:30] there's you know trouble and all these
[1:22:31] things but you're going up
[1:22:32] as long as your trajectory is up that's
[1:22:35] the main thing
[1:22:35] so david was was um there and you know
[1:22:38] he was about to be part of that battle
[1:22:40] with the philistines that would uh
[1:22:42] ultimately kill saul and jonathan but
[1:22:44] then he managed to get out of that
[1:22:45] battle
[1:22:46] and um he would come back he would be
[1:22:47] coming back to ziglag where all of his
[1:22:49] family was
[1:22:51] and i've never ever come back or
[1:22:54] begin to journey back home and see my
[1:22:56] house on fire and smoke coming up
[1:22:59] and maybe you know well i remember when
[1:23:01] i was young
[1:23:03] it was it was uh because i was at
[1:23:04] primary school and we actually saw this
[1:23:08] all the smoke come up from there where
[1:23:09] my house was this is in gisborne
[1:23:11] but it was actually the um petrol
[1:23:13] station on fire
[1:23:14] but it was pretty much you know pretty
[1:23:16] close to where our house was so at first
[1:23:18] you think well
[1:23:19] is that our house but in the close you
[1:23:21] get you realize it's not your house but
[1:23:22] imagine you flip it around the other way
[1:23:24] you think is that the neighbor's house
[1:23:25] is it this house no you find out it's
[1:23:27] your house
[1:23:28] and it wasn't just his house on fire the
[1:23:30] whole city was on fire
[1:23:32] and so they came back to ziglag
[1:23:35] and they they found out that all their
[1:23:38] family had been taken captive
[1:23:41] but none of them were dead and david and
[1:23:44] his men came to the city and behold it
[1:23:46] was burned with fire and their wives and
[1:23:48] their sons and their daughters were
[1:23:49] taken captives
[1:23:50] then david and the people that with him
[1:23:52] lifted up their voice and wept
[1:23:54] until they had no more power to weep
[1:23:57] this is the spot he was in his walk with
[1:23:58] god he's just about to step on the
[1:24:00] throne
[1:24:01] it's always darkest before dawn you know
[1:24:03] the prince of god brings us new hope
[1:24:06] you know when the lord comes in you know
[1:24:08] into a service or you're praying or
[1:24:09] wherever you may you know god comes near
[1:24:11] it just just rekindles your hope doesn't
[1:24:13] know
[1:24:14] gives you a renewed strength lord you're
[1:24:15] still with me in this battle
[1:24:17] holy or so so they wept until they had
[1:24:19] no more power to weep
[1:24:20] and david's two wives were taken captive
[1:24:23] his family was taken captive
[1:24:25] his uh his men that gathered themselves
[1:24:28] to david all their family was taken
[1:24:30] captive and even as men got to such a
[1:24:33] spot
[1:24:33] because they had they had lost
[1:24:35] everything you know you can replace a
[1:24:37] house
[1:24:38] you can replace cattle you can replace
[1:24:40] you can replace physical things
[1:24:42] but you can't replace family you can't
[1:24:44] just go get another one
[1:24:47] so here they were their most prized
[1:24:49] possessions their family had been taken
[1:24:51] captive
[1:24:52] and they even planned they're going to
[1:24:53] stone david this one that they knew was
[1:24:56] coming into power as king they got
[1:24:58] they got so discouraged at their state
[1:25:00] at what their five senses declared
[1:25:02] i mean that they decided well we're just
[1:25:04] gonna stone him
[1:25:05] but david because he had sat at the
[1:25:07] table of the lord
[1:25:09] he knew where his source of strength was
[1:25:12] his source of strength wasn't his mighty
[1:25:14] men
[1:25:14] his source of strength was in his family
[1:25:17] and his source of strength was a
[1:25:19] covenant god had made with him
[1:25:21] god promised david you're going to be
[1:25:22] king it wasn't david
[1:25:24] making the promise with god that he was
[1:25:26] going to be king god told david you're
[1:25:28] going to be king david
[1:25:29] i've anointed you for this purpose
[1:25:31] that's why my spirit's upon you
[1:25:33] i mean your your life is going to
[1:25:34] fulfill this prophecy of you becoming
[1:25:36] king
[1:25:37] we've been anointed too you know i don't
[1:25:39] know if you realize that but
[1:25:40] we're under an anointing actually the
[1:25:42] whole world is anointed amen this world
[1:25:44] has become drunk
[1:25:46] i mean from the cup of wine in the
[1:25:49] hand
[1:25:50] the whole world has become drunk via
[1:25:53] social media religion politics wherever
[1:25:55] people are
[1:25:56] steeping staggering along under the
[1:25:58] influence of a spirit
[1:25:59] intoxicated but then also the bride of
[1:26:02] christ is under the influence
[1:26:03] i mean we're under the anointing of the
[1:26:05] mighty angel himself
[1:26:07] that we are drunk by the stimulation of
[1:26:09] revelation of the word
[1:26:11] hallelujah i mean so here he was he knew
[1:26:13] what his source of strength was
[1:26:15] he says but david encouraged himself and
[1:26:18] the lord has god
[1:26:20] i mean that's why our opening scripture
[1:26:21] was you know basically if we could just
[1:26:23] think of all the mighty works god has
[1:26:25] done
[1:26:26] they're too many to tell we can't number
[1:26:28] them all
[1:26:29] there's just so many things what god has
[1:26:31] done in our lives he's called us
[1:26:34] he's justified us he sanctified us
[1:26:37] he's glorified us he washes of our sins
[1:26:40] took our first nature away gave us a new
[1:26:43] birth filled us with a spirit hallelujah
[1:26:45] established our goals in his word
[1:26:47] made us new creatures in him has he not
[1:26:49] done these things he he's healed us when
[1:26:50] we're sick
[1:26:52] amen when we're troubled he gave us
[1:26:54] peace we were a burden with care and
[1:26:56] worry he came and took those cares and
[1:26:58] worries
[1:26:59] he showed us the way through every
[1:27:00] situation i know that's very generic
[1:27:03] terminology but i trust when i say those
[1:27:05] things you can look back and say
[1:27:06] lord you've done so much i was once
[1:27:08] stooping in darkness and you gave me
[1:27:10] light
[1:27:11] once i had no peace now all i have is
[1:27:13] peace for my soul
[1:27:15] hallelujah so he began to encourage
[1:27:18] himself when the lord has god
[1:27:21] if you ever want an answer from god
[1:27:23] start to encourage yourself in the lord
[1:27:25] i mean start to encourage hallelujah you
[1:27:28] may
[1:27:29] just have one testimony just encourage
[1:27:30] yourself in that testimony
[1:27:32] holy lord you called me out here i am
[1:27:34] i'm called out you called me i didn't
[1:27:36] call myself you called me
[1:27:38] hallelujah you found me lord amen
[1:27:43] and then david said to abethar the
[1:27:44] priest a himalayas son i pray thee bring
[1:27:46] me heather the ephod
[1:27:48] and abbathar brought hither the ephot to
[1:27:50] david and david inquired of the lord
[1:27:52] saying
[1:27:53] shall i pursue after this troop shall i
[1:27:55] overtake them and he answered him pursue
[1:27:58] for thou shall surely overtake them and
[1:28:00] without fail
[1:28:01] recover all i just want you to think
[1:28:03] what it would have been like there he's
[1:28:05] standing in a ruined city
[1:28:07] so his five senses have have declared to
[1:28:09] him his family's gone
[1:28:11] his property's burned up he's lost
[1:28:13] everything and that's
[1:28:14] and his men are angry at him but then
[1:28:16] when god drops that revelation into his
[1:28:18] heart
[1:28:19] because he wants to know am i gonna can
[1:28:21] i get this back lord
[1:28:22] can i get my family back can i get my
[1:28:24] joy back can i get my piece back can i
[1:28:26] get my first love back
[1:28:28] can i get my long sufferingness back how
[1:28:30] can i get those things back
[1:28:32] and god says you shall overtake them and
[1:28:34] without fail
[1:28:36] recover all i mean so when god dropped
[1:28:38] that revelation in his heart hallelujah
[1:28:40] his five senses still declared he had
[1:28:42] nothing
[1:28:43] right his eyes didn't see his family he
[1:28:46] couldn't hear their voices he couldn't
[1:28:48] feel them he couldn't see them he
[1:28:49] couldn't touch them
[1:28:50] amen but the revelation dropped in his
[1:28:52] heart they were his
[1:28:53] amen and when that revelation dropped in
[1:28:55] his heart that was good as in his
[1:28:57] possession
[1:28:58] already oh that's the power of
[1:29:00] revelation it declares what the five
[1:29:02] senses cannot declare
[1:29:04] hallelujah amen so it changed his whole
[1:29:07] life what a feeling that would have been
[1:29:08] amen we're going to recover all boys why
[1:29:11] because god said so
[1:29:13] it's not because i'm saying so god told
[1:29:14] us we're going to get him
[1:29:16] hallelujah i believe it amen so he went
[1:29:19] and he recovered all
[1:29:20] you'll recover all david hallelujah
[1:29:24] remember as i said it wasn't david that
[1:29:26] promised that his men would recover all
[1:29:28] right it was god god promised him yeah i
[1:29:30] mean it wasn't a man
[1:29:32] that said you got an eternal body
[1:29:34] waiting for you in the heavens
[1:29:35] wasn't a man god told you i trust god
[1:29:39] has told you you've got a theophany
[1:29:41] waiting
[1:29:42] holy in the heavens why did you jump to
[1:29:45] that well it's quite simple
[1:29:46] this message has come to show us we have
[1:29:48] an eternal body in the heavens
[1:29:50] and to me that changes the whole
[1:29:52] perspective you can burn it you can
[1:29:54] shoot it you can rob it you can whatever
[1:29:56] you want to do to this guy
[1:29:57] it don't matter i've got a body waiting
[1:29:59] for me in the heavens
[1:30:01] god has already promised me i've got a
[1:30:02] i've got a change of clothes i can put
[1:30:04] on hallelujah
[1:30:08] amen isn't that wonderful isn't it
[1:30:11] wonderful that we're not hoping we're
[1:30:12] going to make it
[1:30:14] i trust it has anchored into your heart
[1:30:17] i
[1:30:17] yeah it's not oh i hope i'm going to
[1:30:18] take a rapture no no you have to take
[1:30:20] one
[1:30:21] you're booked in oh this is what this
[1:30:24] message has said it's actually said you
[1:30:26] are going in a rapture
[1:30:27] this message is the shout of first
[1:30:29] thessalonians 4.
[1:30:32] hallelujah amen i'm on my way to heaven
[1:30:35] shouting victory
[1:30:37] see our god is a god of stability he
[1:30:40] wants you to know that you are his child
[1:30:42] he doesn't want you to guess at it think
[1:30:44] about it because if you're guessing then
[1:30:46] you'll put your own
[1:30:47] own human well lord i do this so
[1:30:49] therefore i have to be your child no
[1:30:51] he's got a drop of revelation in your
[1:30:52] heart and then your life will be
[1:30:54] according to that revelation you'll live
[1:30:55] it out
[1:30:57] amen so it wasn't when peter said on the
[1:31:00] day of pentecost i probably
[1:31:02] if i repeat myself well here i am you
[1:31:04] know when peter stood up on the day of
[1:31:06] pentecost
[1:31:07] it wasn't peter preaching was it it was
[1:31:09] god preaching
[1:31:10] he just happened to be using peter's
[1:31:11] vocal cords and so when peter stood up
[1:31:14] and he promised he said if they would
[1:31:17] repent and be baptized everyone in the
[1:31:19] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:31:20] of sin
[1:31:21] and they shall receive the gift of the
[1:31:23] holy ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:31:25] to your children
[1:31:26] and all that are far off has been is the
[1:31:28] lord our god shall call amen
[1:31:30] it wasn't peter saying that's the way it
[1:31:32] was god speaking through him saying
[1:31:33] that's the way
[1:31:35] hallelujah so it wasn't peter that
[1:31:37] promised it
[1:31:39] god promised it we've really got to take
[1:31:41] stock
[1:31:42] who's promised these things god promised
[1:31:44] it and god cannot fail he cannot lie
[1:31:48] i mean it's impossible for god to give a
[1:31:50] promise and take back the promise
[1:31:52] if god's promised a certain thing it's
[1:31:54] got to happen
[1:31:55] hallelujah so we can encourage ourselves
[1:31:57] in the lord today
[1:31:58] lord if you promised it oh then you'll
[1:32:00] fulfill it
[1:32:02] in your season you will fulfill your
[1:32:03] word amen that we don't need to worry
[1:32:06] about it lord if you've promised it
[1:32:08] it's going to come to pass hebrews 6
[1:32:11] and 17 wherein god willing more
[1:32:14] abundantly to show unto the ears of
[1:32:15] promise
[1:32:16] the um the immutability of his counsel
[1:32:18] confirmed it by an oath
[1:32:20] that by two immutable which is
[1:32:22] unchangeable things in which it was
[1:32:24] it was impossible for god to lie
[1:32:27] we might have a strong consolation who
[1:32:30] have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
[1:32:33] the hope
[1:32:34] set before us he can't lie god can't lie
[1:32:38] so if he promised it he'll fulfill it
[1:32:40] hallelujah and
[1:32:41] if god gave the promise he has to
[1:32:43] fulfill the promise
[1:32:45] it's not us that has to fulfill it god
[1:32:47] has to fulfill it
[1:32:48] amen i put a lot of pressure on god
[1:32:53] because god's the one who gave the
[1:32:54] promise lord when are you going to
[1:32:56] fulfill your promise
[1:32:57] amen is that all right that's how we
[1:32:59] should be lord that says in your word
[1:33:01] certain things i have need of lord you
[1:33:03] said this is mine lord
[1:33:04] when will you bring it to pass in my
[1:33:06] life hallelujah
[1:33:09] now there's power in testimony
[1:33:13] there is power and confession we must
[1:33:16] confess the word of god
[1:33:18] we must never confess the negative we
[1:33:20] must confess the positive
[1:33:22] brother abraham even prayed said lord
[1:33:24] when he was renewing his consecration to
[1:33:26] the lord lord i've been too negative
[1:33:28] i want to be positive i see he says he
[1:33:30] says in one place i surrender my
[1:33:32] negative thinking to you
[1:33:33] we should always think positive we
[1:33:35] should never ever think negative
[1:33:37] all negative things come from the devil
[1:33:39] he's the one who tells you you'll never
[1:33:41] make it here he's the one that tells you
[1:33:42] your children aren't coming
[1:33:43] he's the one who tells you you can't
[1:33:45] have revival that's negative
[1:33:47] oh your brother and sister like this
[1:33:48] that's negative we should always think
[1:33:50] positive
[1:33:51] hallelujah amen to this power and
[1:33:54] testimony
[1:33:55] amen because when we begin to testify
[1:33:57] about his word then god can anoint that
[1:34:00] and it can come to pass
[1:34:01] amen when we say amen to the word what
[1:34:03] happens god can actually take it
[1:34:05] and make it live hallelujah amen because
[1:34:09] he just wants someone to agree with his
[1:34:11] word when you really agree with his word
[1:34:12] he'll bring it to pass in your life
[1:34:15] amen brother brown would speak about a
[1:34:17] man called john ryan
[1:34:20] and this is just one of the counts of it
[1:34:22] from the super sense
[1:34:24] old john ryan so well what i should say
[1:34:27] first is in revelations 12 11
[1:34:29] and they overcame him which is the beast
[1:34:31] and you know all the powers of hell
[1:34:33] the serpent the dragon and they overcame
[1:34:35] him by the blood of the lamb
[1:34:37] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:34:39] they love not their lives unto the death
[1:34:41] so part of that testimony is what god
[1:34:43] has done
[1:34:43] but we should be testifying of what the
[1:34:45] word says about us
[1:34:47] right amen so old john ryan
[1:34:50] he says he says there was a blind beggar
[1:34:53] in fort wayne
[1:34:54] uh there were we went that day and he
[1:34:57] was prayed for in the meeting
[1:34:58] that was the night before the piano
[1:35:00] played the great physician now is near
[1:35:03] without anybody by it and when he was
[1:35:05] blind he was catholic by face
[1:35:07] uh faith sorry he stopped in the line
[1:35:10] i looked at him and i said your name is
[1:35:13] is john ryan
[1:35:14] yes you're a beggar on the corner you've
[1:35:16] been blind for years
[1:35:17] yes that's right you're a catholic by
[1:35:19] faith that's right
[1:35:21] i said thus saith the lord you receive
[1:35:23] your healing
[1:35:24] say thank you sir i said thank the lord
[1:35:27] he said but i can't
[1:35:28] see i said that has nothing to do with
[1:35:30] it you're healed
[1:35:31] he went down along they helped him off
[1:35:33] the platform the natural man could not
[1:35:35] see nothing
[1:35:36] they couldn't see no results from that
[1:35:38] at all why he said he's just as blind as
[1:35:40] he ever was
[1:35:42] so two of his friends brought him back
[1:35:44] and put him in the prayer line again
[1:35:46] and run him through again howard let him
[1:35:48] pass through when he come back again he
[1:35:50] said mister
[1:35:51] you told me i was healed i said you told
[1:35:54] me you believed me
[1:35:55] he said i do believe you i have no
[1:35:58] reasons not to believe you
[1:36:00] said you've told me all things in my
[1:36:03] life
[1:36:04] he said i don't know what to do this is
[1:36:06] how people are normally trained what do
[1:36:08] i have to do to obtain the promise
[1:36:10] he said there was a woman back there
[1:36:12] testifying
[1:36:13] and she had a goiter a few minutes later
[1:36:17] it's gone away i said then if you
[1:36:19] believe me why are you questioning me
[1:36:21] i'm telling you the word of god
[1:36:23] he said what must i do sir now notice
[1:36:25] this knowing he was a catholic
[1:36:27] and had to have something physical that
[1:36:29] he could hold to
[1:36:31] i said just keep testifying by his
[1:36:33] stripes i'm healed and give him praise
[1:36:36] the old man for the next two weeks or
[1:36:37] three he stood on the corner and sold
[1:36:39] papers
[1:36:40] he would holler extra extra praise the
[1:36:42] lord i'm healed extra extra praise the
[1:36:44] lord i'm healed
[1:36:45] when he come back to the meeting the
[1:36:47] next night
[1:36:48] i couldn't hardly preach for him he'd
[1:36:50] raise up and holy one keep quiet
[1:36:52] praise the lord for healing me praise
[1:36:54] the lord for healing me
[1:36:56] as a as a catholic he didn't know
[1:36:59] how to take hold of faith but he knew if
[1:37:01] he just kept on saying it
[1:37:03] and kept on and kept on and kept on
[1:37:05] until that
[1:37:06] sixth sense would go to work
[1:37:09] that's right praise the lord for healing
[1:37:11] me he was standing on the corner
[1:37:13] hollering praise the lord for healing me
[1:37:15] extra praise lord for healing me
[1:37:17] and he'd walk down the street and as
[1:37:19] somebody came by how are you john
[1:37:21] praise the lord for healing me all right
[1:37:23] and i laughed at him and made fun of him
[1:37:26] and another little news boy led him over
[1:37:28] to the barber shop for a shave
[1:37:30] for two or uh about two or three weeks
[1:37:32] later
[1:37:33] from the meeting and the barber put him
[1:37:34] up in the chair lathered up his face
[1:37:36] said john
[1:37:38] i understand some little smart alec he
[1:37:40] said i understand you
[1:37:41] yours down to see the divine healer he
[1:37:44] said yes i went down
[1:37:45] he said i understand that you got healed
[1:37:47] just to make fun of him
[1:37:48] and the old man said yes praise the lord
[1:37:50] he healed me and his eyes came open
[1:37:52] out of that barber chair he went and the
[1:37:54] towel around his neck the barber trying
[1:37:55] to catch him with the razor in his hand
[1:37:57] and down the street he went why god's
[1:38:00] word had went
[1:38:01] to work i mean so it took a while for it
[1:38:04] to go from here down to here but
[1:38:05] eventually we're from here
[1:38:07] down to here and that he was healed holy
[1:38:10] because remember
[1:38:11] it wasn't brother brown said that you're
[1:38:12] healed he said thus saith the lord
[1:38:14] you're healed so as god said you're
[1:38:16] healed
[1:38:16] it means if god says a certain thing now
[1:38:18] we have to respond and receive it
[1:38:21] even with the same faith that was spoken
[1:38:22] to our sin amen
[1:38:24] hallelujah so sometimes you can see way
[1:38:26] out of grass powers anything going to
[1:38:27] happen in my life
[1:38:30] but you just got to confess it like it
[1:38:32] is
[1:38:33] and then let god go to work just like
[1:38:36] john ryan did now i'm not calling you a
[1:38:37] bunch of catholics
[1:38:38] but people are conditioned a certain way
[1:38:40] what do they have to do to obtain the
[1:38:42] promise
[1:38:43] amen we just got to anchor it let it
[1:38:46] anchor down from here down to here
[1:38:48] because when he was in the barber chair
[1:38:49] that was just subconsciously yeah i'm
[1:38:50] healed
[1:38:51] praise the lord i'm healed and anchored
[1:38:54] down in his heart hallelujah
[1:38:56] but why is that because he overcame the
[1:38:58] blindness
[1:38:59] by the word of his testimony amen that
[1:39:02] because he was confessing what the word
[1:39:04] had already done for him
[1:39:06] amy because by his stripes we were
[1:39:08] healed amen
[1:39:10] hallelujah now god he cares for us
[1:39:14] he's a real father he really cares how
[1:39:18] we're going to end up
[1:39:20] amen it would say in jeremiah 29 11 for
[1:39:23] i know the thoughts that i think towards
[1:39:25] you saith the lord thoughts of peace are
[1:39:26] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:39:29] now these thoughts cannot change like we
[1:39:31] think about people
[1:39:33] i could you could think about me a
[1:39:34] certain way and i do something in your
[1:39:36] presence or you hear something about me
[1:39:38] do you think about me differently
[1:39:40] right but god's thoughts cannot change
[1:39:42] if he's to if he's thought about you a
[1:39:44] certain way
[1:39:45] that's how you're going to be so if he
[1:39:47] thought about you before the foundation
[1:39:48] of the world as one of his attributes
[1:39:50] that be expressed to the earth to be his
[1:39:52] bride he can't change his mind
[1:39:55] he can't change his mind remember david
[1:39:58] decided that jo
[1:39:59] he he made a covenant with jonathan that
[1:40:02] we're going to look after each other's
[1:40:04] family whatever whatever happened so so
[1:40:06] the thought that david
[1:40:08] had towards mephibosheth was you're
[1:40:10] going to sit at my table
[1:40:11] i can't change my thought about you
[1:40:13] doesn't matter your crippled places
[1:40:14] whatever my thought towards you are you
[1:40:16] sitting at my table to eat at my table
[1:40:18] continually
[1:40:19] says the same thing with you and i he
[1:40:21] cannot change his thoughts towards us
[1:40:24] hallelujah it's not based on our
[1:40:26] performance
[1:40:28] it's based on us receiving his word
[1:40:29] believing him
[1:40:31] because we are his seed that's what it's
[1:40:33] really based on
[1:40:35] hallelujah i could never become it well
[1:40:38] he said you will
[1:40:40] right and then faith comes in and it
[1:40:42] produces what
[1:40:43] he says you are amen
[1:40:48] now abraham he lived a life that
[1:40:51] patented every believer's walk
[1:40:53] he's a pattern for our life his walk
[1:40:57] abraham came to a spot where it was
[1:41:00] absolutely impossible
[1:41:02] for him to have isaac this may be very
[1:41:04] elementary but
[1:41:05] you know he was 75 years old about when
[1:41:07] god called him
[1:41:08] he'd been living with sarah married to
[1:41:10] her for many many years before this
[1:41:12] they had already gone past the age of
[1:41:13] having children and so god
[1:41:16] it had to be only god that could produce
[1:41:18] the promise
[1:41:20] it was literally impossible sarah
[1:41:22] couldn't
[1:41:23] have a baby so so they tried to do it
[1:41:24] with their own human understanding well
[1:41:27] if you can't have the baby through me
[1:41:28] just have it through hagar and then
[1:41:29] it'll be my son
[1:41:30] that wasn't how god he he never intended
[1:41:33] it that way
[1:41:33] it was god it was abraham and sarah were
[1:41:35] part of the promise
[1:41:37] so it had to be a supernatural
[1:41:39] intervention by god
[1:41:41] for the promise to be fulfilled now if
[1:41:43] this is the pattern
[1:41:44] you know if his life is the pattern of
[1:41:46] every believer's walk
[1:41:48] then this is how it has to be in our
[1:41:49] lives
[1:41:51] right it's not our human ability that
[1:41:53] will bring the promise to path
[1:41:54] pass it's god intervening because of the
[1:41:58] covenant he made with you
[1:42:00] remember the covenant abraham made with
[1:42:02] god made with abraham was not
[1:42:04] conditional
[1:42:05] he says i've made you father of nations
[1:42:08] that's who you are he had no children at
[1:42:11] the time
[1:42:12] he was you know he couldn't have
[1:42:13] physical children yeah i mean you know
[1:42:15] he physically couldn't have children
[1:42:16] with sarah
[1:42:17] but god made a promise remember you know
[1:42:19] i i really hope it anchors in our heart
[1:42:21] god if you've made a covenant with me
[1:42:23] you're going to fulfill that
[1:42:25] you're going to fulfill that promise
[1:42:28] so god had to give
[1:42:32] abraham an experience in order to
[1:42:34] fulfill
[1:42:36] the promise of isaac coming now genesis
[1:42:39] 17
[1:42:41] the lord reveals himself to abraham that
[1:42:43] that does become abraham and it says
[1:42:45] when
[1:42:45] abraham was 1909 the lord appeared
[1:42:49] unto abraham and said unto him i am the
[1:42:51] almighty god
[1:42:52] walk before me and be thou perfect and
[1:42:55] i'll make my
[1:42:56] covenant between me and thee and will
[1:42:57] multiply thee
[1:42:59] exceedingly now when he says that i am
[1:43:01] the almighty god if you take it down
[1:43:03] into the hebrew
[1:43:04] it actually says i am el shaddai
[1:43:08] hallelujah and el shaddai has has a few
[1:43:10] meanings
[1:43:11] but one of the meanings is actually
[1:43:12] means the strength giver the life giver
[1:43:15] kind of like a you know a mother breast
[1:43:17] feeds her baby
[1:43:19] so he's actually saying i am basically
[1:43:21] the breasted god
[1:43:22] feed off me i'll give you strength for
[1:43:25] you to fulfill the promise
[1:43:27] and this is the way that every believer
[1:43:29] has to be as we actually nurse off the
[1:43:31] promise of god
[1:43:32] that we receive strength in order for it
[1:43:35] to be fulfilled
[1:43:36] that's why i say david knew where his
[1:43:38] source of strength was he encouraged
[1:43:40] himself from the lord
[1:43:41] because that el shaddai that revealed
[1:43:43] himself to abraham was the same god that
[1:43:45] met david
[1:43:46] right so he knew where his source of
[1:43:48] strength was that's why we've got to be
[1:43:49] real careful
[1:43:50] you know where do we get our strength
[1:43:52] from you know it's been proven
[1:43:55] medically that social media produces
[1:43:57] depression
[1:44:00] there shouldn't be a shock it's been
[1:44:01] years it's been it's been tested and
[1:44:03] proved and shown
[1:44:04] that depression is linked to social
[1:44:06] media use
[1:44:07] so the more we feed off those things it
[1:44:10] can make us happy at the time because it
[1:44:12] actually
[1:44:12] triggers dopamine in our brain which
[1:44:15] isn't a chemical that's released because
[1:44:16] of addiction
[1:44:17] and we can be enjoying it at the time
[1:44:19] but it actually produced depression
[1:44:22] that's why it's so addictive and so
[1:44:24] popular is because that's how it is it's
[1:44:26] like taking drugs whatever more there's
[1:44:28] an addiction side
[1:44:29] but it produces depression so i'm going
[1:44:32] to say
[1:44:33] those things can't be our source of
[1:44:34] strength if you want to be weak then
[1:44:37] fill yourself up but my source of
[1:44:40] strength is the lord
[1:44:43] and me saying it's linked to depression
[1:44:44] that's not me trying to say get off but
[1:44:46] i'm just saying that's
[1:44:47] been proven medically yeah who's read
[1:44:48] those studies
[1:44:51] right so if you use those things
[1:44:55] just be careful how you use it right
[1:45:00] but if you find yourself getting
[1:45:01] depressed and moody
[1:45:03] where you've been you're you're you've
[1:45:04] been feeding off the wrong thing too
[1:45:05] much
[1:45:07] right they're tools in the hands of
[1:45:08] people but don't let it use you
[1:45:11] this world we're here to see we're not
[1:45:13] here oh yeah i always get things mixed
[1:45:16] up the wrong way but you know
[1:45:18] use the world for yourself
[1:45:21] don't let the world use you if that
[1:45:24] makes sense
[1:45:25] right so so don't become just another
[1:45:27] hamster in the wheel
[1:45:30] but use it when you need to use it is
[1:45:32] that okay
[1:45:34] so we don't want to become a slave to
[1:45:35] the system i mean we love prisoners of
[1:45:38] jesus christ
[1:45:39] and so so abraham was was there
[1:45:43] and god revealed himself in this way i'm
[1:45:45] i'll shady i so basically nurse off me
[1:45:48] and the promise will be fulfilled you
[1:45:49] know this is the same way we must be
[1:45:52] amen we're called to nurse off god
[1:45:55] hallelujah that the promise will be
[1:45:57] fulfilled brother brahm says now watch
[1:45:58] here
[1:45:59] the first thing you know i see when he's
[1:46:01] 99 god appears to him in a kind of a
[1:46:04] uh to confirm this thing the 17th
[1:46:07] chapter of genesis he appeared
[1:46:08] in the name of el shaddai which el
[1:46:10] shaddai in hebrew means the breast or
[1:46:12] the breasted one
[1:46:13] like the mother where a baby you take a
[1:46:15] little baby and said now abra um
[1:46:18] abraham i'm el shaddai the almighty god
[1:46:21] now you're yet old and your strength all
[1:46:23] gone
[1:46:23] sarah's womb is dead she's 90 like
[1:46:26] little grandma like now
[1:46:27] a great great grandma 90 years old she's
[1:46:30] awful old the people's laughing at you
[1:46:32] making fun of you
[1:46:33] but i'm the breasted one like a mother
[1:46:36] to a sickly fret baby now when the
[1:46:38] little baby's all weak and run down his
[1:46:40] strength gone
[1:46:41] the mother pulls it to her bosom and the
[1:46:44] child nurses his strength from the
[1:46:45] mother
[1:46:46] the mother's strength becomes a child's
[1:46:48] strength as he draws it from her
[1:46:50] yeah hello so so god's strength becomes
[1:46:53] our
[1:46:54] strength as we nurse off the promise and
[1:46:56] he's your powerful god
[1:46:57] there's no limit to his power or his
[1:46:59] ability hallelujah and he said now

[1:47:42] changes not and his covenant people has
[1:47:45] the same privilege
[1:47:46] to draw from the same resource that
[1:47:49] father abraham
[1:47:50] had to draw because god swore by the
[1:47:52] same covenant that he'd give us the
[1:47:54] promise
[1:47:55] holy oh my that's where my hope is built
[1:47:57] on nothing less
[1:47:58] but jesus blood and righteousness when
[1:48:01] all around my soul gives way he's all my
[1:48:03] hope and stay

[1:48:17] from this side
[1:48:18] for my covenant was with christ my son
[1:48:20] and in there he was wounded for your
[1:48:22] transgressions and by his stripes you
[1:48:24] are healed
[1:48:25] i'm the almighty just lean up on here
[1:48:27] and go to drawing
[1:48:29] from them promises hallelujah
[1:48:32] that's what we need to do draw from his
[1:48:33] promises amen because we
[1:48:36] cannot get strength from anything else
[1:48:38] in this hour
[1:48:39] but from the promises of the word you've
[1:48:40] got to realize though the promise is for
[1:48:42] you
[1:48:43] not for your neighbor only but it's for
[1:48:44] you amen
[1:48:46] amen hallelujah
[1:48:50] now
[1:48:53] we won't be too much longer now there's
[1:48:55] a strength that's coming to the church
[1:48:57] today
[1:48:58] hallelujah when when
[1:49:02] john was anointed to write the uh book
[1:49:04] of revelation and and and he was
[1:49:06] uh scribing down the the word to the
[1:49:08] church of philadelphia
[1:49:10] he would say in the um he says and
[1:49:13] and to the church and to the angel of
[1:49:15] the church in philadelphia right these
[1:49:16] things sayeth he that is holy
[1:49:18] he that is true he that hath the key of
[1:49:20] david
[1:49:21] he that openeth and no man shutteth and
[1:49:23] shutteth and no man openeth now
[1:49:25] this this is what he openeth now we know
[1:49:27] jesus is the door
[1:49:29] and so what is speaking of now is is
[1:49:31] actually because the ages lap over one
[1:49:34] another
[1:49:34] as that at the end of the philadelphian
[1:49:36] agent going into the ladies and age
[1:49:38] there would be a door open of revelation
[1:49:40] that will give strength to the church
[1:49:42] now remember because this is we're going
[1:49:44] to we're going to draw strength from el
[1:49:46] shaddai
[1:49:47] brother evan says now then we can see
[1:49:49] that jesus is the door
[1:49:50] he's the door of the sheep and notice
[1:49:52] that it speaks now
[1:49:53] of the door opening and what is that but
[1:49:56] a revelation of him
[1:49:58] and that revelation is going to is
[1:50:00] opening up to bring us strength
[1:50:02] to illuminate the word and to glorify
[1:50:04] his name
[1:50:05] it was in the midst of the last two ages
[1:50:07] that the revelation of the deity of
[1:50:09] jesus christ blossomed out before us
[1:50:11] yes we knew he was god how else could he
[1:50:14] be our savior
[1:50:15] but to know that he is he was the only
[1:50:18] god or god alone that he was alpha and
[1:50:20] the omega
[1:50:21] and this jesus was both lord and christ
[1:50:24] making him the lord jesus christ the
[1:50:26] father the son and the holy ghost all
[1:50:27] one person
[1:50:28] that had been lost since the first
[1:50:30] church ages but now we're seeing it
[1:50:32] again
[1:50:33] the revelation of who he was had come
[1:50:35] back indeed
[1:50:36] godhead is not a three-person god with
[1:50:38] one personality
[1:50:40] for it takes personality to make a
[1:50:41] person if there is one personality
[1:50:44] but there is one person but they who
[1:50:46] believe in three persons have a three
[1:50:47] god godhead
[1:50:48] are guilty of breaking the first
[1:50:50] commandment but the revelation that god
[1:50:52] hit his back but the revelation that god
[1:50:53] um is back now the true church
[1:50:56] can be built in strength again after all
[1:50:59] this time she finally knows who her lord
[1:51:01] is once again we are baptizing in the
[1:51:03] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:51:04] i mean just as they did at pentecost so
[1:51:07] he's saying now
[1:51:08] because this door opened and the
[1:51:10] revelation of who god is now has come
[1:51:12] back into the church and the word has
[1:51:13] come open its fullness now
[1:51:15] i mean now the church can be built in
[1:51:17] strength again
[1:51:19] now all the strength we have need of has
[1:51:21] been released in this age
[1:51:23] and even even as the apostle paul i mean
[1:51:26] i mean
[1:51:26] i mean sorry john he would he would come
[1:51:29] to a spot in revelations 10 where he
[1:51:31] heard the voice of the seven thunders
[1:51:33] but then he was told to seal them up and
[1:51:35] write them not
[1:51:36] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:51:38] seventh angel those things should be
[1:51:39] made known
[1:51:40] hallelujah so there's a part of god's
[1:51:42] word that had strength in it that would
[1:51:45] be released in this hour
[1:51:47] amen and here we are standing in this
[1:51:49] day where i say that the whole
[1:51:50] scriptures come open it's no longer
[1:51:52] symbol
[1:51:52] it's no longer sealed that we don't know
[1:51:54] it's no longer man's opinion
[1:51:56] but god has opened the word to us that
[1:51:58] we know exactly what's in the scripture
[1:51:59] for us
[1:52:00] and what does that do it gives us
[1:52:02] strength to overcome
[1:52:04] holy just like moses preaching there
[1:52:06] caleb and joshua
[1:52:08] they received that word that gave them
[1:52:10] strength you take caleb naturally he was
[1:52:12] 84 years old when he got his inheritance
[1:52:14] but he said i'm as strong now as i was
[1:52:16] then amen give me my mountain holly why
[1:52:18] because he received a strength from the
[1:52:20] word
[1:52:21] that caused him to receive the promise
[1:52:23] for his day
[1:52:24] hallelujah and here we are in this hour
[1:52:27] maybe i'll pick this up another time
[1:52:29] we have a strength in this word you need
[1:52:32] vitamins
[1:52:33] you need spiritual strength it is in
[1:52:36] this word of god it is in the message
[1:52:38] you need strength to overcome it's in
[1:52:40] the lord
[1:52:42] there is a power i believe in this room
[1:52:43] this morning
[1:52:45] amy which is our lord jesus christ and
[1:52:48] if you have need of anything to over you
[1:52:50] know you need power to overcome it's in
[1:52:51] that
[1:52:52] many times all we need is a fire to be
[1:52:54] lit
[1:52:55] hallelujah just like i said on wednesday
[1:52:57] there's a brother being ordained and
[1:52:59] brother brahm said well
[1:53:00] um i don't know for some praying for
[1:53:01] them or someone else but he said lord
[1:53:04] they prayed lord wrap them up and burlap
[1:53:06] sacks pour a whole bunch of kerosene on
[1:53:08] them
[1:53:08] light them a flame and send them out
[1:53:11] hallelujah
[1:53:12] and that's and that's what we really
[1:53:14] need we need a fire to be lit
[1:53:17] not an argument to be polished not a
[1:53:19] retention of knowledge
[1:53:21] but a fire to be lit and if that fire's
[1:53:23] lit
[1:53:24] oh my watch out devil hallelujah
[1:53:28] amen but he cares for you what's the
[1:53:31] effect of sitting at his table
[1:53:34] you begin to rejoice you begin to praise
[1:53:37] god
[1:53:38] you begin to thank him for his goodness
[1:53:41] though your five senses do not declare
[1:53:42] the promise yet the revelation
[1:53:44] drops in your heart like david's it's
[1:53:46] all going to be restored
[1:53:48] hallelujah it gives you power to
[1:53:50] overcome remember god made the promise
[1:53:52] man didn't give you the promise god gave
[1:53:53] you the promise so we should thank him
[1:53:55] for giving us the promise
[1:53:57] shouldn't we the covenant of his word
[1:53:59] remember jesus died on calvary
[1:54:01] did everything god was he'd give to you
[1:54:04] the apostle paul breaks it all down the
[1:54:06] book of ephesians all the inheritance of
[1:54:07] the saints in light that's you
[1:54:10] right that's the purpose he died that
[1:54:11] god will come and dwell in you and
[1:54:13] manifest his word through your life
[1:54:15] hallelujah so we should thank god it
[1:54:18] wasn't conditional
[1:54:19] it's unconditional i have
[1:54:22] just like abraham was told you're father
[1:54:24] of many nations and abraham believed god
[1:54:26] has come to him for righteousness
[1:54:28] and it was manifested so there's
[1:54:29] something god actually puts faith in us
[1:54:31] to receive his word
[1:54:33] i mean so even to be a believer we say
[1:54:35] thank you lord for making me a believer
[1:54:37] if you don't have a but but i'll say
[1:54:38] this if you don't have a faith in your
[1:54:40] heart you say lord put that faith in my
[1:54:41] heart
[1:54:42] reveal yourself to me restore the joy i
[1:54:45] may have had years ago restore it to me
