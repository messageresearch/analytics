so far what great services the um the outpouring of the holy ghost and not just here but i think the whole time you know that the spirit of god's been here whether we've been in our cabins or walking around or fishing or eating in the kitchen whatever we've been doing the spirit of god's been here and there's a saying that i like and it's a saying that says on a guard and a blaze of glory something about that saying i like because it means you're going to keep going right to the very last dying breath you're gonna you're gonna go out you're not just gonna like whimper over and flop

specials this morning we've got um brother mo and brother anias and where are they both put your hands up here we go oh yeah good good okay mo you you first bro like you i keep fighting voices in my mind they say i'm not enough every single lie that tells me am i more than just the sum of every high and every love remind me once again just who i am because i need to know you say i'm strong but i can't feel the thing you say i am strong when i think i and when i don't belong i believe oh i believe what you say of me [Music] i believe the only thing that matters now is everything you think of me and you i find my worth [Music] [Music] i you say i'm yours and i believe oh i believe what you say of me [Music] i believe taking what i have and now i'm laying it at your feet you have every failure you have every victory [Music] [Music] [Music] oh i believe what you say of me i believe oh i believe oh i believe what you say help me believe [Music] [Applause] hey what's cheese amen first of all i think i want to thank the team we literally didn't have much time to practice yesterday i guess they were hearing the two songs for the first time so to say okay this is how i sing the verses this is how i sing the the choruses but they caught on amen so just in case i won't have the time to thank you after this thank you amen when we sing the singer has to be in the same spirit as the people that are begging him so i feel comfortable when the people that are playing catch the way i want the song done if they miss a chord it doesn't sound right you're missing something i want a minor there so we get to travel on the same plane now it takes me back to brother branham i always wonder why god chose brother branham he will explain to me when we get there there were so many educated people in the world billions literally but he chose an uneducated man from kentucky and that an educated man will take his stand on the pulpit his grammar was if he have studied literature say hey this is terrible grammar but god did it for a purpose when he preaches you say he doesn't sound but listen to it further don't just hurry he's just speaking about this about hunting about that then he gets to a place where he gets in the groove he preaches his message then that message that doesn't sound so special he gets to the end and he says you know who i'm waiting for you know who i'm waiting for he's here the ministers that were sitting behind there looking where is this one who is here where is this one who is here and then he says now be careful now i take over control i it wasn't him it's because he is there i take over control of every spirit here under my control so all the billions whatever they are is now under my control he is here so that's the anointing i'm talking about i work with an anointing with the singers when we get on the same anointing i feel comfortable they feel comfortable amen this song is called we have the message so i'll just read one verse before i sing it we have the message we have the word we are waiting for the trump the shout was heard we are going to meet him for we are the bride our blessed lord and god our god divine amen

so in control there's just so many supernatural things he's orchestrated this weekend i just had to say you know what you're doing lord praise the lord and brother isaac you i didn't tell him that but just let me say is my favorite congregational song so it was a blessing to come after that amen praise lord let's just um take our bibles thank you musicians god bless you we'll turn to john chapter one just uh pray for me this morning i'm i don't consider myself to be a minister but if you'll pull lord will help me to step out of the way then i'm sure something will be said which will help you amen praise god john chapter one starting from verse 1. amen it's a well-known scripture in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to be a witness of the light that all mean through him might believe he was not that light but was seen to be a witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me amen and of his fullness have we all received and grace for grace amen praise the lord in genesis chapter 1 verse 11 i'm needing this water a lot sooner than i thought i would my mouth gets dry pretty quick standing up here genesis chapter 1 verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind notice this after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good amen in romans chapter 11 you don't have to turn there but i'm just going to read one verse there for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches amen god bless you you can take your seats damn if we look back to this time in genesis chapter one i'm just gonna put this down here in genesis chapter 1 where god was creating the earth as he was bringing all these things into manifestation which he had in his thoughts he established a law and that law was that every seed every form of life had to bring forth after its own kind so with the animal life if it was a dog it would bring forth a dog if it was a sheep it would bring forth a sheep you know whatever animal it was it had to bring forth that same life it's the same with plant life if it was a pumpkin it had to bring forth a pumpkin if it was a grapevine it would bring forth the grapevine if it was an apple tree they would bring forth an apple tree so whatever those seeds were they had to reproduce after they kind and that means that whatever sea was planted that seed had a dna on the inside which had to produce the same life which it contained right that same law was present in the human race you can look at you know even after the four you can look at cain and abel cain was a direct lineage of the serpent adam or abel was direct lineage of the son of god which is adam and abel was able to receive revelation cain wasn't and he was a murderer like his father so that sea just brought forth after its kind so the life which is in every seed ultimately manifests what's in itself now i'm sure we understand the principle of reaping what we sow right god doesn't punish you for your wrongs if you repent but there's a law in place that you reap what you sow right but says here in the quote god keeps his word in the message god keeps his word little church struggling now for the kingdom of god i'm going to try not to take too long brother ben i might have to skip some stuff but just um we'll just leave that in the lord's hands um little church struggling now for the kingdom of god don't never falter in this day if you do quickly repent jump right back up see if you stump your toe don't fall if you fall get up get up might get up sure if you've made a mistake now this revival coming on and you want and you went back and got cold and different wait get down to your bible walk out in the apple orchard somewhere get out yourself and say god now here i am i'm sorry of the scene you're going to get a whipping for it just remember that yes indeed you'll reap what you sow out yes sir but whatever you do take you up in here get right up straighten up say father here i am whip me just as thou sees fit lord here i am that's right and walk right back with a hallelujah in your heart god lets the whip down on you you say yes lord i deserve every bit of it just keep on going god will take you through all right it'll be over one of these days amen see so god's aim is never to break us down it is always to build us up always satan's goal is to condemn and to break down to destroy but god's goal is always to build up to heal right the interesting thing i heard by the rams say the other day janice and jambrus they could produce everything that moses did but they couldn't take it away brother ram says the reason they couldn't take it away is because god's the only one that can bring healing satan can't bring healing so he'll bring destruction and condemnation on all these things but he'll never show you the way out right but god always shows you the way out only god brings healing god brings deliverance because where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty i want to make the statement that god is not an insecure god he doesn't get upset just because somebody dared to do something that he he didn't want right he doesn't do that that's not how god works so and it's the same way with you know with parents and i'm not a parent yet but i'm just i'm just showing you the word here is the way you raise your children i might get in trouble for this one kind of say the way you raise your children the way your children relate to you is inevitably the way they're going to relate to god until god gives me an experience so we've got to be sure that the way we raise them is the way that god deals with his children right the god is not insecure he's a father and everything he does for his elect is for their benefits amen so god put this law of reaping what you sow in place and he does that so that we can learn to do what's right so no chastisement is pleasant for the time but it works the peaceable fruit of righteousness by the alpha i really enjoy that service yesterday that was amazing and you know sometimes like that it's necessary for the lord to really point out things you know on the head but if it's done with the right spirit which i believe it was it brings redemption it brings freedom like we saw yesterday so the things we sow we will reap you know and we can do things sometimes which would scare us for life if we made the wrong choice but is god mean by allowing it does he love you less by it not at all he loves you just the same it's just the seeds we sow which brings forth its kinds like david and beth she by david sowed the wrong seed and he ripped you reaped what he sowed for years afterwards with um with amnon and with tamar and absalom killing amnon later he was reaping for years what he sowed even though god had forgiven him right so we've got to be careful what we sow satan will be ready to give you handfuls of tears everywhere you go to get you to sow that in your life but the flip side is true too god's given us his word and if we sow the word in our lives then it will bring forth the right thing the bible says in hosaiah hosea chapter 10 sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fellow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you now i want to just move the focus a little bit and say now the word of god is also a seed right so jesus tells the parable of the seed that fell in the ground right they got sowed by the sower some of that seed fell in good ground some of the fell in stony places some of it fell you know amongst the tears and so forth but jesus said those who hear the word and with an honest heart keep it and then bring forth fruit with patience that's the good ground like bring forth fruit with patience it's not about you manifesting the word in your eyes your life if the right seed is sown it will produce the right life but just like any natural seed just sowing it is not enough it's got to be watered it's got to have moisture and it's got to have warmth to grow so we've got to keep it in the right atmosphere the things we've heard this weekend i promise you when you walk away from here satan is going to come and he's going to try and steal it away from you he's going to try to discredit it and make you believe that it was just emotion and it was just you know just a bunch of excitement but don't believe that don't let the devil steal that away right so you know if we if we keep that seed in the right atmosphere then it starts producing the word if it if we stay in the word stay in the right atmosphere and in the lord's time the lord quickens that seed and brings it to life in your in your life that's a law of god so as we continually behold the image of christ he changes us from glory to glory into his image brother branham likens the promises of god to his seed he says and show us the father and it will suffice us you can take a man that looks like a christian acts like a christian but if that man hasn't got the word of god in him if there isn't a germ of life in there to germatize that he will never raise up in the resurrection that's right because he can't rise there's nothing in there to raise him up again a seed now when you bury a seed you farmers you take you take and go out here and plant your corn you don't go out every morning and scratch it up and say let's see now is it growing anything happening to it no put it back down late the next day you say oh i want to see if it's getting along alright scratch it up again it'll never grow like that well the thing you got to do with the sea you commit it to the ground cover it up that's all you can do about it it's up to god to do the rest of it keep that seed in the right atmosphere i mean obama says well that's the same way it is with the word of god if you'll take any divine promise of god made in his bible put it in your heart and water it every day with the praises of god that's going to come to pass it'll grow if you don't quit fooling with it you'll if you'll just leave it alone he says don't say now let me see can i move my finger any better today or do i feel any better or headache a little bit better oh no it'll never be that just committed to god and walk away and leave it alone that's god's seed it will grow so don't fret about trying to bring to pass the promises of god in your life right don't fret about do i have the holy ghost don't i have the holy ghost if it's god's word if you've met his requirements if you've repented like what the alpha said you've been baptized it's god's word and it's up to him to bring that to pass in your life one thing i said to the to the young people the other day something that the devil kept me in bondage with a long time was that i was looking for this lightning and thunder experience you know sometime and i felt like i couldn't be a real christian until i got that and then the lord showed me hang on your experience is not just about a single occurrence a once-off thing it's an everyday walk where god reveals himself to you more and more so don't if the lord's given you a lightning and thunder experience praise the lord but don't go looking for that and expecting that because god works differently with each one right so if you've if like i said if you've been if you've repented and you've been baptized you've met god's requirements and all you need to do is believe that word and that seed will come to pass that seed will produce so that conception takes place without sensation so don't try to dig up the seed and see how it's getting along just leave it in the lord's hands it's not up to us to make the promises of god come to pass as his promises he's the one that makes it come to pass amen so if you see the promises of god if you want to see it come to pass in your life just commit it to him water it with praise and believe it eventually you'll look back and you'll see hey all these things are starting to come to pass in my life and i don't have anything to do with it it wasn't me that did it because i wasn't the one that stirred it up it just started happening by itself praise the lord all the lord's work now there's another seed that i want to talk about and that's you you are the predestinated seed of god right so if we look at a natural seed from a plant like a wheat seed we can see a perfect resemblance to us as a train being i had a slider which i wanted to put up but um i actually forgot my flash drive so uh it's okay i'm just gonna demonstrate it but you have a seed on the outside you've got the shell or the coat lid on on the and then just a little bit closer to the inside you've got where the nourishment is is the endosperm and then on the inside of that you've got the root of life which is the embryo right so it's like body spirit and soul there's a quote here which i i got from the internet where um somebody says the seeds for new life are found inside fruit they contain everything necessary for the growth and development of a new plant the three primary parts of a seed are the embryo in the endosperm right which is which is the um uh is is just around the embryo in the middle and the seed coat the embryo is the young multicellular organism before it emerges from the seed so the embryo is where the life lies right the endosperm is a source of stored food consisting primarily of starches the seed coat consists of one or more protective layers that encase the seed so this is this is interesting now we have this type with a case it represents our body which is the outer shell we have the endosperm which represents our spirit and then we have the embryo which represents the soul and that's that's the part that contains eternal life right now notice this they say the endosperm is a source of stored food for the soul so the things you feed on in your spirit is what filters down to your soul and generates either faith or unbelief right that by the brown says the channel to our soul is through the spirit so we've got to be certain that the things we feed on is the things that is what god said we've got to feed on the word the word comes into the spirit and then by revelation god brings that down into your heart and then it brings forth life right amen so there's only two senses and that's faith and unbelief and if you feed on the wrong things it creates unbelief and says you know unbelief is sin he hammers that point many times unbelief is sin so that's why there's a lot of things for us as christians which we don't do not because there's a verb item quote or a scripture which says don't do it but because it generates unbelief if it's a wrong atmosphere like a bowling alley or something which probably hammers a lot he doesn't do it because there's something wrong with throwing a ball within you know thin plastic pins it's about the atmosphere you've got to be in the right atmosphere surround yourself with the right atmosphere with the right things because then that filters down through to the soul right so so yeah so if we're spending too much time in the things of the world right and we and we feed on that i'm just i'm skipping a few things here but um you know that filters down to our solar produces faith our own belief so if you feed on the right thing it'll produce faith in your soul so faith comes by hearing the word and it's not just hearing it with these ears it's hearing it by revelation right the holy spirit making it alive to you making it personal to you so when god quickens something to you it anchors so deep in your soul that the devil can't touch it right that's why jesus said on this rock i'll build my church which is the rock of the revelation of jesus christ to you personally right i also spoke about that the other day as well to the young people that has to be a personal revelation to you it's not somebody else's experience that you depend on the lord places ministers there to preach the word and to guide us but ultimately we have to have our own experience with jesus christ so that's the thing that's the key is to creating the right atmosphere for that seed to grow so the more time you spend in the presence of the lord the more it will feed that embryo that soul right and brother brown said that soul is what dominates the spirit and in the body so if faith is reigning in your soul it will express itself right right through to the body now notice that the embryo is where the gym of life plays brother branham often speaks about it i'm still kind of laying a foundation here but but the branham often speaks about it when the cold comes and you know the winter and the leaves drop off the trees and so forth that seed or or you know the problem says the ground freezes and that seed bursts open and the pulp runs out of it he says here in the message hear him here's something that happened not long ago as you all know i'm a hunter i was a game warden for years i've hunted around the world africa india all over the mountains my mothers are half indian my conversion never took it from me i love the woods that's where i found god in nature going out in the woods and see little flowers you can't hide it let it die a log can fall over it and bury that little seed in there and it'll rot and the pop run out of it when springtime comes that little seed of life will work its way around that log and stick its head up and praise god you can't hide real life not over a bushel real life shows itself it can't kill it it'll live again just as sure as anything the frost can bite and the little flower and it bow its head they have a funeral position the four rains cry and bury the little thing it rots the bulb goes out the petals are gone the seed gone burst it open the pulps run out but somewhere in there is a little germ of life that no science can find just let the sun go to shine and warm the sunrise it'll live again if god made a way for a flower to live again how much more has he made a way for a man to live again you don't have to die to receive it you have to die to yourself then you won't have to impersonate nothing you got the genuine thing amen the brotherhood says that science can't find their germ of life even if they try it they can't reproduce a blade of grass right so to the naturals to the natural eye that seed might look as dead as it can be but god looks deeper than that and he sees that in that embryo there's a germ of life there there's a germ of life and in his time that will come to life and nothing is going to stop it right that germ of life was a part of alum before the foundation of the world now this this really blessed me as well the brother spoke about it a lot this weekend but so in god's mind he had this mystery hidden which was a threefold purpose right he had a threefold purpose in his mind and as we heard the first part was to reveal himself in christ right the original seed you might be seeing where i'm going with this but that's christ was the original seed he wanted to reveal himself in christ in the first part of his purpose to have the preeminence and his people right by his life living in her in the second part and to restore the kingdom back to what it was at the beginning and the third part so i'm going to come back to this now we were a central part of what god had in his mind right back then it doesn't matter how deep you appeared to be there was a part of god on the inside of you from before the foundation of the world right and it cannot be lost that part of god cannot be lost it's like that sea lying in the ground you know dormant in the cold in the winter and so forth there comes a time when the sunlight pierces through to that seed and nothing can stop that seed from coming to life right so when the s o in light reached you and you heard the message and like brother adrian commented when you recognized it was eagle food you heard from your theophany right you recognize that it is christ revealing himself to you and that's when that life right of christ connected with that germ that was on the inside and you came alive and out of seemingly nothingness that lifestyle is growing right brother says there's a law of life which has to be expressed it's a law of life right a law is something which can't be stopped there's a law of life on the inside that has to be expressed if you pour a slab of concrete over the grass during the winter around somewhere where the grass is the thickest it's right around the edges of the concrete because you cannot suppress that life that life right the satan might try to pour a slab of concrete on you right after the word's been sown i promise you like i said you when you walk away here he's gonna try to pour a slab of concrete on you young people the lord's done something for you be careful because satan is gonna try to pour a slab of concrete on that but don't you let him don't you let him steal that away right you just keep feeding on the word stay in a word atmosphere and then the lord will continue bringing that word to pass in your life right so you are a seed that is predestinated to life but says that's predestinated by four knowledge god didn't god didn't say ah i like this one i'm gonna pick this one i'm gonna pick this one no he could predestinate because he knew which ones were a part of him before the foundation of the world he knew which ones received the word back there did not believe the devil's lie and who would receive it today amen so that is how god predestinated by that full knowledge we rejected the devil's line the beginning and that's why we rejected today we believe the word today because we believed it in the beginning so when that word strikes it right that germ seed manifests the dna of its daddy so the bible says you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins now he quickened right brother says you had to have something to quicken to begin with right so when we were drawn to the message when we recognized that it was christ revealing himself it shows there was something inside us to quicken right it's like the lily it was if it's buried in the mud you know when that light reaches that lily seed all the way down there that life will manifest so even if you feel like there's a whole lot of mud on top of you that life will manifest once that ray of sunlight reaches that seed you might feel like there's a whole lot of human weakness on top of you a whole lot of lord i'm such a failure you know i'm i can't do it myself that's a good place to be when you recognize that to me i believe that's one of the greatest revelations is when you recognize i can't do it myself but god has to be the one that does that because when he does it no man can stop it nothing can bring it to it to stop amen that's a good place to be so i want to ask you is it the seed's job to somehow climb through the mud work its way to the top of the mud before it can express itself no not at all it is simply up to the sea to say lord help me help me and then lord reveal yourself to me and then when the law does it when he reveals himself to you nothing will stop that life from manifesting it's not in your flesh it's not in your spirit like it's not in the seed coat or the endosperm it's the embryo on the inside starts growing and the seed like that embryo that case can't stop it either right it might be a horrible case right i sometimes look at this case and i go oh this is an awful case but this case isn't going to stop it right in the lord's time as that life starts growing that case just breaks open and more and more you look at your life and you say that's christ that's not me that's christ praise god amen so say lord interpret your word by bringing it to pass in me amen god doesn't need an interpreter he just needs somebody who's willing to yield and when you're willing to look away from your human abilities and look at christ then that sunlight can germinate that life right the life of christ will germinate that seed and bring it to life and christ will express himself through you to the world brotherham says you're in the token university can tell you what a seed seed is made out of but it can't give a seed life your education only takes you further away from god there is only one can give you life there is only one can give you life he says it twice and he will do it if you'll apply the token tonight he is here to give himself to you and give you life jesus christ is your life praise god amen and this word that's been preached this weekend at the camp it's preaching the seed of god it's preaching life right it is such a blessing to be here brothers and sisters to be here where the word is preached right not from a human humanistic perspective but preached with life preached with life now remember now a seed needs light and water in order to germinate right but that's not where it ends that seed needs to stay in the right atmosphere to continue growing so when a son or a daughter of god has been brought to life you you can never lose that life again right the bible says grieve not the holy spirit of god by which you are sealed to the day of your redemption nothing can take that away but we've got to stay in the presence of the s-o-n right of the lord of jesus christ drink at the springs of living water amen continuously feed on the word stay in the right atmosphere in prayer fellowshipping with the lord praising the lord praising him for what he already has done right not just one day he's already done a work right and you just keep praising god thank him already even if you don't see that seed yet eventually that leaf will pop out through the mud and you'll start seeing it come to pass so one of my one of my favorite verses isaiah says isaiah chapter 26 i believe he says thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee right that's the key is to keep your mind stayed on christ and then you stay in perfect peace that doesn't mean that there aren't going to be trials which comes sometimes the lord sees trials which absolutely breaks you right but if your eyes are on christ you still have a peace a peace through the storm through the trials that's the key is to keep your eyes on christ those things come to produce character in us right it produces character but if we just keep our eyes on christ we'll have a peace which passes all understanding amen peace doesn't come from the outside and work its way and it comes from the inside and works its way out right we don't produce peace by trying to force peace around us the life of christ in us the joy of christ in us produces peace amen keep our minds stayed on christ now as we stay in that atmosphere beholding the word right we changed into the image of christ and we start looking more and more like our daddy day by day and his seed his life starts producing after it's kind in us amen amen i want to come back to that but if i first want to go back to this thought of seed to seed that's my title this morning as seed to seed so notice this now that's every seed has to bring forth of its kind right the life which is in that seed is what makes it what it is right you can have two seeds which look absolutely identical right like you know but the brown speaks a lot about the true vine the false fine you can have seeds which look absolutely identical but if you plant it and like potatoes preaching is the word manifests life that's on the inside of that seed as soon as those seeds even if it's a wheat seed and a tear seed it manifests when the word comes on it right and that's not just you know it's not just on a on a dispensational level it's not just on a church age level it's on an individual level or even in our own lives if there's a seed if you're not sure which which seed it is just check it with the word you know just bring it to the word bring it under the light of the word and it'll manifest the seed that it is but the mam says here in questions and answers we're fixing to take communion just in a moment and i really want this to sink into you the thing of it is what's in your heart will produce make your life what kind of a seed you put in the ground will produce after its kind how can you take a popcorn plant and make a gems and weed out of it you couldn't do it no more than you can make a grain of corn and make a cockle bow you couldn't make them because they're two different natures two different lives altogether then you might take a gems and weed seed and an onion seed and they look so perfect alike till the very best of men couldn't tell them apart that's right the only thing you have to do is plant them they both look alike naturally but plant them they both will produce and one will be a gems and weed and the other one will be an onion right that's exactly right say why what makes the seed it just looks exactly like this produce a different kind of life it's because the kind of life is in it he says and a man of women a man or woman that professes to be a christian and don't live that kind of life by the grace of god notice this he says live that kind of life by the grace of god is a gems and weed by their fruits you shall know them if that things in your heart bears record of what you are somewhere else if it's evil it bears record that while you're down here when you die you'll just have to go where you are already if you're good and you're good because god has made you good and you're born again you're bound to go that way because that life will have to bear record with this place he says if it bears record record of here that's where you'll go if it bears record sorry he says if it bears record of down here that's where you'll go if a bear's record of up there that's where you'll go amen so kind of the kind now c c to c2c now the life which is inside us it makes us what we are right there was an original seed that went before us so god had this threefold purpose in his mind before the world began and the first part of that is that he would reveal himself to his bride through christ who was the original seed right and in the old testament when when a new harvest came they presented a wave offering that wave offering was the first fruits of the harvest that was to come right and it was a sign of what was to come it was the first fruits now brother man says in the sea of discrepancy and we know that jesus was the word saint john once said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt here among us then the word is a seed and the seed become flesh and dwelt among us jesus christ was the spoken word to mary made flesh right he was the original seed and and take note of this now a seed is something which has the potential to bring forth more of itself right and jesus christ was the original seed so his life that seed has to bring forth more of itself i trust you can see where i'm going with this if he was the first fruits who is the harvest i'm looking at it right here this is the harvest right here right god purposed before the foundation of the world he would reveal himself through christ who was the original seed right the first fruits in the first fold of his purpose but he wanted more than that right he by revealing himself through christ he wanted his life to come into a crop in this last days right and by that by his life having preeminence in his people and a bride he would produce the same life that was in jesus christ and that way he would have preeminence through a bride in the second fold of his purpose so that seed which walked the shores of galilee has reproduced itself again today in our lives by his life he has preeminence through the bride right so if that original seed expresses itself again it's not just through one seed but it produces many seeds right so christ is walking in flesh once again in a many-membered body right in many seeds in you and i he's produced his life again and you and i as a mini-member body amen so god tabernacled in christ as the original seed the christ was also a triune being right shall endosperm embryo now remember that the life that is in the seed is what causes it to bring forth certain fruits right so jesus said that for a seed to bring forth of its kind it had to die it has to abide alone and die right so jesus christ came and he paid with his life he paved the way so that his kind which is his seat after him could receive his life by him giving that life and bring forth himself again in this day right so if if jesus christ had not died he would have abided alone but like adam he chose to give up what he had so that he would not abide alone he decided in gethsemane that he was willing to take the way of suffering he was willing to give his life so that he could have a people in this day right that was redeemed back to himself so as a seed falls into the ground and dies he died he fell to the ground and died so that he could bring forth much fruit and we are that much fruit amen jesus was our first fruits and all by the way says all that christ was he poured into the church right the god has once again brought forth kind after his kind in us and seed has been brought back to seed again praise the lord that's the way she manifests his life is by surrendering to him and letting him live his life through her amen that brings forth the manifestation of christ says here in the quote the spoke spoken word is the original seed it's a longest quote just bear with me every seed must come after its kind god made man in his image after his kind to be his word on earth he expressed it in jesus christ what was god was in christ that's a man after his kind see when god which is the word how many knows he's the word when the word was in christ a man human man expressing itself through him that was god the word in christ expressing itself and god in the beginning made man in his own image and that's the kind of man that god makes me makes today the seminary and the incubator hatchery turns out a bunch of hybrids see the schools but when god calls a man he is in his own image the word made alive in him that's right there he is there's god's man man made in his own image in his very likeness and jesus said he'll do the works that i do so god made man in his own image after his kind his kind what's his kind the word he is the word then if a man denies god's word how can he be in god's image just ask the question ask yourself how can you be in god's image and deny god's word when the word is expressed is the expressed image of himself oh he says it doesn't mean that the expressed image of god say oh i said it but it didn't really mean it i was wrong back there back up you know there was for some other time i didn't mean it oh mercy he says trash slop of the devil that he feared to eve don't let him try to poke it down an elected neck amen no sir they won't believe that just come join with algae join nothing you've got to be born not joined a new creature in his own image of his kind to be his expressed word on earth now jesus was god's expressed word do you believe that then what are we to be sons of god too with the expressed word in the church carrying on that's the mystical body of christ carrying on the same works that jesus did when he was on earth when he was here on earth see that's the kind after his kind praise god god's life producing a crop again now you can have the lutheran kind after the lutheran the methodist kind after the methodist the catholic kind after the catholic the pentecostal after its kind the oneness after it's the trinity after its but if you're god's kind that's different see you're the expressed image of the word making itself manifest oh my why it's got to the water falls on it it's got to do it praise god jesus christ was our first fruits and he he fell into the ground and died so that he could produce much fruit which is us right and he planted the seed on calvary and on the day of pentecost he sent back his life right he sent back his life into the church which was a seed after him and that sea that life produces the same life that was in christ so on a church age level you know we had we had the sea that died in the dark ages in the ground fell in the ground again and germinated again produced a stalk with luther the tassel with weasley and so forth and the shock with the pentecostal movement but now it's gone all the way back around to the original in our day and mature seed is producing the same life that was in christ today in our age god having preeminence in his people right we've had the shout right we are now in the voice we are the voice the bride is the final voice to the final age because it's the same life it's by his life living through her she is the final voice to the final age and it's all about him it's not about us it's not about our abilities our works it's about his life living it through us that just takes all the pressure off doesn't it praise god so our knowledge and our understanding isn't the life it isn't our works or our abilities it's the life of christ and the embryo the soul of the bride right that's the life of christ and that produces that life again in us as long as that predestinated seed stays in the right atmosphere it will bring forth the life of christ automatically and you can't stop it praise god nothing the devil does can stop it you know brother-in-law says you've sometimes god has to let those winds come and shake the tree around but you know just loosen those roots up a little bit so that it can dig down deeper and hold on hold on deeper grow deeper right grow stronger in christ and brother brahman says again in the spoken word is the original seed he says now remember every spoken word of god is the original seed god planted everything in the earth by his word and as long as you stay with the original seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again i i spoke on this a while back this is not in my notes but god spoke the word over us right it goes from from thought to word to flesh right and god spoke the word over his bride he said he's gonna have a bride without spot or wrinkle right he's going to have a perfect people and that word that he spoke it was a seed that fell into the ground for a little while but it has to produce because god spoke it it was his eternal thought he spoke it and that has to come to life in flesh right from thought toward the flesh so christ is that original seed and if we stay with christ remember this the word is christ the word is not just the letter the word is christ and if you stay with christ his life will produce itself in you jesus was prophesied to bruise the head of the serpent and jesus christ in our day is still bruising the head of the serpent amen he got a real bruising this weekend praise the lord and don't let it stop there right when you go away don't let it stop there right just let the lord continue his work in you and you'll continue bruising that serpent's head amen notice that prophecy when he said it to eve he said it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel notice this now it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel that's because christ was the one that was bruised on calvary so that we don't have to be bruised right he was bruised for our iniquity but the bride shares in the victory of christ that's why it says it shall bruise thy head and not just he shall bruise thy head because it's christ and his bride male and female together which is still bruising the head of the serpent praise the lord says you know the church age book it's that that same life you know it thwarts satan it thwarts him he'll be just as thwarted with that last day church as he was back then because it's the same life that's in her praise the lord again in the spoken word is the original seed um i might skip through this a little bit okay man was made to die he was made to live man sorry man wasn't meant to die he was made to live but high breeding brought a death there she hybrid it now do you deny the serpent see then i'll ask you why you what's the reason funeral service is about she was a hybrid every one of us are hybrid from the original that's the reason you're constantly dying excuse me but oh god there's a germ of life come from the real seed but god proved it was his seed he rose him up again see that through that life that's going over the original seed like was given to eve over his real church is bringing forth life again through the birth through the womb of his bride amen can you say that lord let your word be born in the manger of my heart amen through the womb of his bride see oh it's rich and glorious i give it a little time to study so it'll it'll sink in he is that seed he is that seed that was produced by the word of god be it unto me according to thy word there's the seed see taking the word amen that's the cro the attitude that christ wants us to have is be it unto me according to your word not lord help me to somehow produce your word no be it unto me according to your word amen but it says now jesus is the word made me made manifest he and the word is one and the same and that's why it was made so perfect oh sorry ma it was so made manifest in him so perfectly that's the reason that god manifested himself so perfectly in christ because he was the seed word the germ word itself the germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed you get it see he was the germ word of god the germ is the spirit the germ is the water so he says here the germ it's all about christ that's the point he's making here right the germ is the spirit the germ is the water and jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth its life to water other seed that was coming praise the lord oh do you see even he said other sheep that's not even of this fold i have they're going to see that they're going to get that word and stay right with it and i'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it'll produce just exactly it'll produce miracles it'll produce the power of god it'll produce and it will not deny anything because it's kindred seed with the seed amen i can't say mr cockerbury you can't live with me no sir no sir no it won't do it no indeedy it just won't mix can't mix death in life you can't be dead and alive at the same time see so you see what i mean it is the germ that come from the seed he is he is the word of god made perfectly manifest that's the reason that in him was what that was the thing that he is correctly the son from the first adam was the son that was produced was promised through adam continue on the human race and eve hybrided to the serpent and brought forth a generation of bastard children born to death without life and jesus come and was that seed he proved it everything that adam lost jesus was see he is the correct everything listen to this says everything that adam lost jesus was and jesus christ has again like i said poured himself into fullness into the church so we have everything that adam lost is being restored back to us amen now notice how he speaks here about hybridization i'm not not too far from done hopefully every time man hybridizes something puts his own interpretation to it it produces death right it dies it can't go any further right but a hybrid so hybrid can't produce the life of christ right only the true seed can produce the life of christ so notices the original seed life cannot be hybridized because as soon as you hybridize it it's not so you can hybridize the seed but you can't hybridize the life in the seed okay as soon as you hybridize the seed the original life leaves right and it cannot ever produce that original life again right it has a perverted life of its own then so when man takes the word and tries to interpret it themselves it produces death right so that's the lutherans organized and they started interpreting the word themselves so that the with the wesleyans and the pentecostals and it died right but the true life the true life carries right on down that lineage of predestinated seed but brahman says here and have not i sent thee so when a man tells you and and you the children going to school and they say that we come from a single cell in the ethics of darwin he just doesn't know what he's talking about see you take a horse and a well let's say a donkey in a mirror and they have a cult it's a mule but that meal cannot breed to another meal and have a meal it finishes right there hybrid corn you could hybrid corn and then you could plant that corn it won't be nothing see won't be nothing has to come back so how can then if we begin on evolution from single cell then where we at see their own scientific research proves them wrong see you can't do it you can breed the blue violet with a white violet and get the african violet but just leave them to themselves and they'll go right straight back to the original blue violet that's right so you see what he's saying here is not that the hybrid life produces it again but the hybrid life dies out right and it's only the original thing which remains brother says so when god spoken made man and man's soul was lost it absolutely anything outside of that joining church and anything is hybriding you've got to come back to god's got to speak the word back again that makes it life eternal when god speaks life into you then that's eternal again but until that it's a hybrid condition you see so the devil mingled with it and mixed tried to mix faith and something unbelief together so it makes a hybrid see but when god speaks and places the holy spirit in there and seals it it's eternal amen it's eternal it's it's interesting to note you know with the modern trend of technology science has been developing seedless fruit right so you know look at mandarins or bananas or grapes oranges whatever they've developed the seedless fruit by tampering with the life right and it's just the same way with christians who are under a denominational anointing they have a measure of fruit right it looks like fruit genuine fruit but they you know you might speak in tongues or produce you know all seemingly all the gifts of the spirit but there's no life in there there's no ability to reproduce that life of christ right it's a hybrid religion and it has no ability to reproduce life because it's sterile right so the way i looked it up and they say the way they reproduce these these seedless fruit trees is by grafting right brother brandon speaks about that it's merely it's a denominational life which feeds off the tree of life it produces it keeps producing in its own kind of seedless fruit which is dead denominational life without the life of christ but the bride grows from the original life right the bride isn't another branch which is just grafted and the bride is an original life is is the tree that's put forth its own branch again and it's the exact same dna as the main stump amen that's the original seed producing itself again so it fell into the ground in the dark ages right and by the restoration of the bright tree she's she's grown back again through justification sanctification restoration of the gift and finally today in our day it's back to the fruit which contains the seed right and it's producing the same life that was in christ so you know denominations can try to graft their life into this tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch it produces the same dna as the original and it will produce the same manifestations praise lord it's not her life it's not our life it's the life of christ in us that produces the word if we try to convince ourselves of our righteousness just by our work or how righteous we can live it leads to death because it's a perversion righteousness comes only by accepting god's work of grace and the holy spirit bearing record of that in your life that's how the life or the righteousness of jesus christ has applied to you so we need to just surrender to that and let the life of christ live through us abraham says now we find out as went on said as janice and jambres withstood moses we talked about that how that these things would be in this last day now and last quotation was was that god made every seed after its kind that's his see when he was made man when he made man in his image was a seed of his word and when jesus was made flesh he was the flesh of the word of god and when we receive the word of god then we become god's word in our flesh see the church should be in that condition right god's word in our flesh that's the second fold of god's purpose the brother man says here later in the same message spoken word is the original seed and a real seed of god is an absorbent for the spirit all denominate all the nominal denomination that that word is taken out all unbelief is out and when the holy spirit comes into that germ of life that's laying there it produces another seed i want you to take note of this because i want to touch on this again it produces another seed just exactly another son of god is born amen another amateur god son of god i'm a brandon because i was born of charlie and alibranum that makes me a branham because i'm their seed their two agreements with the sperm together made me a seed that made me when god and his word becomes one hallelujah when god's spirit waters the seed of god the word of god it produces god and it's not the individual it's god for what you are dead you are not yourself no more you wrecking yourself dead hollowed out waiting for the sea germ then what is it it isn't you no more it isn't the man it's god in the man it's the sea germ like the beginning spoken word it's god's word made manifest in the man then it isn't a man it's a man that's died he can't be a hybrid and a son at the same time he's either a son of death or a son of life so if he's the son of death get it over to the devil or sorry give it over to god i meant and let him kill the devil that's in you run him out and hollows you out then then let god plant his own life in you then it's not you no more it's god's life because it's god's word watered by the holy spirit will produce the same thing you see it so you notice this now the same when a tree puts forth a branch again it produces the same life right the same fruit it produces the same fruits of the spirit it produces the same love that was in christ it produces the same attitude towards others that was in christ right so a seed remember this a seed is something which has potential to produce more of itself right the same works of god is to be manifest in this bride now what is the works of god the works of god is more than just signs and healing and demonstration of the power it's more than that right it that's definitely part of it right healing the sick and raising the dead and so forth that's very much part of it but it's not all of it right so notice this now under the third pull or sorry under the first pull it was a sign that was in the hand right it was just the seed coat it was just the flesh the sun that's in the hand the second pull was the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart right that went deeper it went into the endosperm the spirit it was the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart but the third pull was about a spiritual union it was about the life of christ coming to the embryo the soul of the rainbow trout right it was more than just about natural healing it was about producing life in the bride right in the church so that same life that was in christ as as the messiah that same seed that in us is what makes us mini messiahs do you believe that brother rams is here sorry i'm just messing up my notes here so that same life is what makes us amateur redeemers amen so that life of christ and us if we are a seed of god that same seed has the potential to bring forth more of itself and that same life of christ in us produces more sons and daughters of god right like paul calling timothy his son in the gospel he said um you know timothy my son so forth my son in the gospel he wasn't his natural son he was the son of the gospel so we are called to live the gospel and allow it to produce the same life and draw others to christ through our lives amen so that same attribute of redemption that was in christ that should be expressed through the church is expressed through his people in the second fold of his purpose amen the brotherhood the bible says you know that death and life are in the power of the tongue so if we speak our interpretation of a word it produces death right but if we are yielded to christ and god anoints us as vessels yielded to christ when we speak under the anointing of the spirit the holy spirit can ride on those words and produce life in the era if they have the ability to receive that it can produce life in the here now it's like the bible says while peter yet spake these words the holy spirit fell on them that heard the word so if we're speaking the word right but ram says if if that bride is so surrendered to christ it's not her speaking anymore it's deity speaking through her right so if you speak the word of god the undiluted word of god to a brother or sister it will produce life if there is an ability to produce life it will produce the life of christ right so the holy spirit can write on those words and penetrate into that embryo right into that heart and then that brother or sister can come to life right that doesn't just count for ministers right that counts for every son or daughter of god that's surrendered to his spirit right that's surrendered to christ us as ministers we're not any more important than the laity we're servants to the laity right but any vessel that is anointed by the spirit of god can speak life to another elected vessel amen so like mary she was anointed by the holy ghost to produce the christ child right and while she was speaking to elizabeth when she spoke the name of jesus john in elizabeth's womb received the baptism of the holy ghost you believe that amen so it's not not just works science it's not just uh just healing natural healing it's about that life producing more of christ right in others so and it's not it's it's not just about coming to life it's also you know you can have a brother and sister which can be a holy ghost filled but they can be clouded over with the wrong spirit and you speaking the word under the anointing of the spirit can move back that spirit and can produce freedom in a brother or sister's life right so if the un uncompromised word is preached by the anointing of the holy spirit it produces life doesn't matter which way you take it it will produce life right not bondage not works it produces the life of christ so amen so because you know you can ask the question why because it's not you speaking you know and brother man says it's deity speaking when that vessel is surrendered to christ we are anointed vessels anointed to carry forth the word of our hour right the life of christ today christ living through us right christ loving through us and christ producing his work through us we don't have to follow the signs the signs follow us because we believe the word right the life of christ fulfills his own word through us all the christ was he poured into the church she is him amen brother braham says here in the messiah i was talking about messiah the messiah messiahs they are the life sorry they are the light of the church today the light of the world jesus said to his disciples ye are the light of the world now you're a candle that sits on a hill that a light can be seen from everywhere we are the light if we are we reflect his messiah life the messiah sign follows the messiah's the same as it followed the messiah amen it's so good it's it might be a controversial topic but i love it anyhow that because the life of christ is in the bride today the mercy seat that was on the cross 2000 years ago is in the bride today right that mercy seat is now in the bride mercy is now in the bride amen and that's why you know brother you know the bible says if you if someone gives you as much as a cup of cold water they won't lose their reward because they're not doing it just to a normal person or just to anybody they're doing it to the mercy seat expressed in flesh again in our day so praise the lord so brother brandon says here here's some time ago in your lovely church here i believe in the same quote now he says i believe i preached on the subject here as the eagles stir with her nest flattereth over her young i believed i preached on that down there brother jack was somewhere yeah eagle stirring her nest i like to watch the big eagle you know that father eagle you know god called himself an eagle did you know that he called his prophet's eagles sure he did he told it that that eagle jacob he found him in a howling wilderness and as the eagle stirred its nest now we find out he calls himself eagle too so he's jehovah eagle and then he's got a bunch of eaglets eaglets like messiah it's eaglets now i can see the big eagle as he's walking around over the nest he loves to look at his children amen i think god was standing here with a if you could see him with a pleased smile on his face looking at everything that was happening here did you know that he called his prophet's eagles sure he did ah sorry now we find out he calls himself eagle two so he's jehovah eagle then he's got a bunch of eaglets eaglets like messiahs eaglets now i can see the big father eagle as he's walking over around over the nest he loves to look at his children oh my now he loves to look at them how do they look look just like he does they're not hybrid they're not half buzzard and half crown something else they're eagles amen that's what we are today we we're methodist baptist assemblies and so and so and so and so buzzards crows and everything else how can we be eaglets how can we when we see the sign of god moving among us and calling it something else hallelujah he likes to because he knows that they are thoroughbred they've got his flesh they got his blood they got his purity amen how proud he looks over his eaglets walking around amen the little egg let's look at him and say how great thou art how great they are look at myself oh my going to take a flight one of these days ain't we papa amen see how he likes to look at them they look like him they act like him they are his flesh his blood his spirit amen that's the way god's church is his eaglets his messiahs they look like him they act like him they preach like him they do the works that he did these things that i do shall he the things that i do shall he do also more than this shall he do because i go to the father amen these signs shall follow them eaglets hallelujah amen they'll do just as i do if my spirits in them they'll do the works that i do jesus christ as the original seed has by his life again produced kind after his kind and he's walking around in flesh again today in a mini-membered body praise god and that's why it's back to the son of man ministry again because christ in fullness is once again expressed in a many member body praise god 1 john 3 verse 9 says whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god so we can say who can accuse me of sin if my life is hidden with christ and his spirit bears record in my life of his righteousness in me who can accuse me of sin praise god for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy that is my opening scripture for root bioli so are the branches because it's the same life it's the same dna amen the same life in both the first fruits and the harvest hallelujah so job asked this question if a man dies shall he live again melbourne says here now that'll go on through december january february march april may now may comes along last of april first of may the seed gone the pulp's gone the pedal's gone the stalk's gone everything there was of that flower is gone that can be seen is it gone no god has provided a way there's a little germ of life laying there somewhere just as sure as that sun rises yonder in the east and begins to shine warm upon the ground it lives again why god provided a way for it to live again if god made a way for a flower to live again what about a man that's made in his image can we have the musicians please what about a man that's made in his image how god has made a way for us to live again but we can say like that like job said i know my redeemer lives and at the last day even if the skin worms destroy this flesh i will see god because i am an expression of his dna in our day there's a law of life within us and nothing can stop that law of life from being produced so there's coming a day where the seeds of god right which sleep in the dust of the earth and the seeds those who are alive and remain he'll say right it's time to take my harvest and he takes them into his barn and in the third fold of his purpose he gathers his elect with them and she reigns and rules with him on his throne praise the lord so he's going to gather his wheat into the ghana with him eden will be restored and that's king and queen again right the original seed and his harvest together raining on his throne because we have the life of god the life of christ in us we cannot die we cannot die nothing can kill that life it will produce itself again and it's not just a perpetual life like a seed it's eternal life it's zoe life that same eternal life will bring us all back together again and he's going to rapture that life he is rapturing that life he's going to take that life with him to be with him for eternity so if you feel brother and sisters like something was said this weekend something was done for you this weekend don't give it up don't let the day of the devil uproot that seed and say hey there's no life there just give a chance to stay in the right atmosphere stay in fellowship with christ right just stay on your knees stay in the wood stay and fellowship with christ and that seed will produce itself again right but the brown makes that statement he says the acorn right it's got everything that oak tree will ever be is right there in that acorn right there it just needs the right atmosphere right and if you're struggling just say lord this is not my word this is your word produce your word in me let me die to self lord let me produce your life in me again today i yield to you lord that's my word that that's my testimony that's my desire praise god let's just um bow our heads one more time let's turn to our feet amen bow our heads
