[10:13] wants to share something so we'll start
[10:14] with you
[10:18] [Music]
[10:23] Andre good morning it's lovely to be
[10:25] here again today um just something that
[10:28] was really that was revealed to me
[10:30] during last last um Sunday sermon and it
[10:33] was just so amazing and it just blows me
[10:35] away every single time when I think
[10:38] about it um I think if you would all
[10:41] agree last week's sermon was a bit of a
[10:44] reprimand me putting us right where we
[10:47] need to be putting us where the Lord W
[10:50] the Lord is a jealous God and it was
[10:53] just so amazing while Ben was saying
[10:56] something and he was saying um I can't
[10:59] quite remember what he said but he said
[11:02] that we need to we need to leave it we
[11:04] need to let go of this certain thing and
[11:08] at that moment when he stopped Andy said
[11:13] God have mercy on us and it was just so
[11:16] amazing how God is putting us right but
[11:18] he's covering us with his
[11:20] mercy and I just every time I think
[11:23] about it it's amazing it it's just
[11:26] amazing that his Mercy is setting us
[11:28] right just every time when we surrender
[11:30] he will cover us with his Mercy cuz
[11:33] that's what he wanted and I just wanted
[11:35] to share that with you guys hallelujah
[11:40] amen is there anyone else that would
[11:42] like to
[11:55] share praise the Lord um it's good to be
[11:58] here um I came here looking for answers
[12:00] and um sister Tony Anne who is my
[12:02] daughter-in-law said to me I bet you'll
[12:04] get answers when you go down there and
[12:06] last night the lord well this morning
[12:08] the Lord vot me I put about 27 minutes
[12:11] past two or something and I was awake
[12:12] for a couple of hours so I got my answer
[12:15] um and it was really simple and I know
[12:18] that everybody every saint of God is in
[12:19] the same um situation that we are
[12:22] suffering persecution for righteousness
[12:25] sake and I my answer was this I will
[12:29] defend my name you defend what I have
[12:32] given you so you defend what the Lord
[12:34] has given you you defend it you defend
[12:36] it with your life if need be but he will
[12:39] defend his name so oh I was really
[12:41] blessed I praise the Lord amen
[12:45] [Applause]
[12:55] amen I know I've shared this with some
[12:57] of you but I just want to encourage
[12:58] everyone
[13:00] uh when we just moved here for those
[13:02] that don't know we were burgled and at
[13:03] the time when we were burgled there were
[13:05] two things I prayed for the Lord to give
[13:06] back to me and that was my jewelry
[13:09] because it was just sentimental it's not
[13:10] something you can replace and they'
[13:12] stolen the hard drive with my boys
[13:15] crawling for the first time and walking
[13:16] for the first time and that's just stuff
[13:18] that you can't get back ever so um it
[13:21] was my prayer the couple of days
[13:24] afterwards I'd been cleaning the house
[13:26] and they' left the jewelry box in my
[13:28] passage cupboard with when they were
[13:29] looking for more bags and that so I got
[13:31] my jewelries back and I was like oh okay
[13:33] just the photos and I even wrote a
[13:36] letter into the newspaper and I asked
[13:37] the people please if you have it just
[13:39] bring the hard drive I don't care about
[13:40] anything else but that never happened so
[13:44] two years on Mom's now visiting and um
[13:47] her and Dad have decided to leave her
[13:49] laptop with
[13:51] me and so we were looking at photos the
[13:53] other night of her holiday and she's got
[13:57] stuff saved on her computer of my boys
[14:00] crawling and walking and do you know
[14:03] that I didn't even realize the Lord had
[14:05] actually answered my prayer had to drop
[14:07] that thought in my head and said but you
[14:10] prayed for this two years ago and I'm
[14:12] giving it back to you and it wasn't how
[14:15] I imagined it at all but I have some of
[14:17] my stuff back and I just want to praise
[14:18] the Lord for answering prayers in ways
[14:21] we don't always understand and not even
[14:23] in a time frame that we' expected in so
[14:25] thank you to him amenah
[14:29] [Applause]
[14:35] anyone
[14:36] else yes um I'll just quick I won't go
[14:41] up there because I bad enough here um my
[14:45] uh you know how we take prayers and we
[14:47] take prayers from our extended family
[14:49] back home and one of the prayers that we
[14:51] prayed for at a prayer meeting was for
[14:53] my mom um I don't know if you remember
[14:55] that she didn't really like her job she
[14:56] was a tax collector and she hated it
[14:58] she'd have to turn up at people's places
[15:00] in the country and um tell them that you
[15:03] know you're going to lose your farm and
[15:04] you know it's not a fun job I could
[15:06] imagine and um so anyway so we we prayed
[15:09] for a job for her and you know you think
[15:12] you I just love that song the lord loves
[15:14] Paradox cuz he works ways that we don't
[15:17] know about anyway so she stayed there at
[15:19] this job and we were praying for I was
[15:22] praying for another job and you know and
[15:24] um anyway so she stays there then people
[15:27] get um laid off so she has to take over
[15:30] two other people's jobs that she
[15:31] normally doesn't so she's getting
[15:33] overworked um and anyways long story
[15:36] short she um this year just recently
[15:39] it's been going on for a couple months
[15:41] now but um they same job but now she's
[15:44] an admin and she works from home so and
[15:48] and she gets paid what she's supposed to
[15:50] get paid and she's got a yeah she loves
[15:53] it so um praise the Lord she he's oh
[15:56] he's an answering prayer God

[16:09] amen okay before I left to South Korea I
[16:12] was kind of a depressed you know all the
[16:15] pressure from work and the house it was
[16:18] kind hard for me but one of my sister
[16:20] she's primary school teacher she told me
[16:22] when you come to South Korea you will be
[16:25] different so I kind of hope of my you
[16:28] know thing and after that I came back
[16:31] from South Korea really God is so good
[16:34] to me and then I feel so happier and
[16:38] even though a lot of pressure from I me
[16:40] work because I have to do kind of work
[16:42] after during one month but you know I so
[16:45] Rejoice you know in the Lord and I feel
[16:48] so you know happy and even though just

[16:52] my stuff said oh Hanah you look
[16:54] different and you're so joyful so praise
[16:57] the Lord God is so good to me and they
[16:59] even though in South Korea my
[17:01] family so you know actually they fed me
[17:04] very well so actually kind of I put on
[17:07] my weight on but except that you know I
[17:10] can see their love and passion towards
[17:12] to me and then I can see the light of
[17:14] God moving to South Korea as well so

[18:23] basically um you know he got taken down
[18:27] to two years which was huge anyway just
[18:29] from his effort and I know from the Lord
[18:31] as well cuz the word miracle was used
[18:33] quite a lot so um that's what it was
[18:35] really um but never before someone's
[18:37] been taken down to two years jail time
[18:40] and never been given home detention so
[18:41] it truly was exceptional and it truly

[35:49] Sunday school meeting afterwards and
[35:51] then there's the uh band practice for uh
[35:54] for Harmony and everything directly
[35:55] after that um if you have your Bibles
[35:59] handed you want to turn with me to
[36:01] Genesis chapter
[36:05] 1 and we'll go to verse 26 now I'm going
[36:08] to go to Isaiah chapter
[36:18] 14 so it says in
[36:20] Genesis 1 and
[36:26] 26 I me everyone's there it says and God
[36:30] said let us make man in our image after
[36:32] our likeness and let them have dominion
[36:35] over the fish of the sea and over the
[36:36] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[36:39] over all the Earth and over every
[36:41] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[36:43] Earth so Man created so God created Man
[36:45] In His Image uh in the image of God
[36:48] created he him male and female created
[36:50] he them and he blessed them and said
[36:52] unto them be fruitful multiply replenish
[36:55] the Earth and subdue it and have
[36:57] dominion over all the fish of the sea
[36:59] and over the foul of the air and over
[37:01] every living thing that moveth upon the
[37:04] Earth so God has commanded you will have
[37:07] dominion let's go to Isaiah
[37:16] 14 Isaiah 14
[37:18] and and from verse
[37:24] 9 I'm glad the scripture is always true
[37:28] for us and our enemy amen hell from
[37:31] beneath is moved for to meet Thee I mean
[37:35] moved for thee to meet thee at thy
[37:37] coming it stirreth up the dead for thee
[37:40] even all the chief ones of the earth it
[37:41] has raised up from their Thrones all the
[37:43] kings of Nations all they shall speak
[37:46] and say unto thee art thou also become
[37:48] weak as we art thou become like unto us
[37:51] thy pomp is brought down to the grave
[37:54] and the noise of thy vials the worm is
[37:56] spread under the
[37:58] and the worms cover thee how art thou
[38:01] fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[38:03] morning how art thou cut down to the
[38:05] ground that did US weaken the Nations
[38:07] for thou Hast said in thine heart I
[38:09] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[38:10] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[38:13] upon the Mount of the congregation in
[38:15] the sides of the north I will Ascend
[38:17] above the heights of the clouds I will
[38:19] be like the most high yet Thou shalt be
[38:22] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[38:24] pit they that see thee shall narrowly
[38:27] look upon on thee and consider thee
[38:28] saying is this the man that made the
[38:31] Earth to tremble and that shake Nations
[38:35] that made the world as a Wilderness and
[38:37] destroyed the cities thereof that open
[38:38] not the house of his prisoners amen may
[38:42] the Lord bless his word you may have
[38:43] your
[38:47] seats so I want to um continue uh in our
[38:52] thought of of uh what what men want but
[38:56] I really want to take it now the the
[38:57] other way is that uh God wants you to
[39:01] know who you are and God wants you to
[39:04] know your position we read there in
[39:06] Genesis chapter 1 that man was given
[39:08] dominion over the Earth so he was made a
[39:11] God over the Earth we understand that
[39:13] God is God of the universe but he he he
[39:16] allowed man to have dominion over his
[39:18] creation which is the Earth but through
[39:20] the fall Satan uh Satan dethroned man
[39:25] and now Satan is the god of this world
[39:28] the scripture says about the God of the
[39:30] God of this evil age has blinded people
[39:32] and you know it speaks about uh in in in
[39:35] Ephesians and we'll read it later about
[39:37] how he's the prince of the power of the
[39:38] year he he where one time Adam had
[39:41] control over all things Adam lost that
[39:44] God part of himself and he was now a
[39:47] slave to you know Satan but I just want
[39:50] to say from the get-go where you know if
[39:52] you're wondering where I'm going with
[39:53] this service it's very
[39:55] simple the and you the powers of hell
[40:00] are not were not ordained to be your
[40:02] master they were not ordained to be your
[40:04] lord angels are servants amen angels are
[40:08] servants doesn't matter if they're
[40:09] fallen or if they're not Fallen Angels
[40:11] were created to be the Servants of man
[40:13] amen amen to to be the Servants of God
[40:16] so Satan and his angels were never
[40:18] ordained to have dominion over man but
[40:20] man was ordained to have dominion over
[40:22] the devil amen so that's where I'm going
[40:25] that's basically what I'm going to say
[40:26] in a nutshell so I just but I want this
[40:28] to Anchor in because you got to
[40:29] understand the blood of Jesus Christ you
[40:32] know we were not created to be slaves of
[40:34] Darkness we were not created to for
[40:36] because the thing that rules us is our
[40:39] Lord and it can be God or it can be
[40:41] Satan but I just say from the get-go
[40:43] Satan was never ordained to be your lord
[40:46] he was never ordained to be your king he
[40:48] was never ordained to be in charge of
[40:50] you but you were ordained to be in a
[40:53] place higher than him amen here is the
[40:55] we we'll read in Ezekiel he's anointed
[40:57] cheer of that cover he was the
[40:59] right-hand man of God so to speak he was
[41:01] an archangel but he was lifted up with
[41:03] pride in his heart and he was cast down
[41:06] but so he was he was right up there but
[41:08] servants are never in the same category
[41:10] as as the family of the king that's
[41:12] right they're not even in the same
[41:13] category they cannot become family they
[41:15] cannot become blood relation to the king
[41:17] the children must be born of the king he
[41:20] they must come out of the king and if
[41:21] they've come out of the king the his DNA
[41:24] is in the children amen and it's because
[41:27] there his DNA in the children that makes
[41:29] them royalty Hallelujah and we ourselves
[41:33] and our Humanity there's nothing good in
[41:35] us but in our souls there's a part of
[41:37] God I mean there's a gan seed God put
[41:40] there before the foundation of the world
[41:42] and because that part of him was placed
[41:44] in us before the foundation of the world
[41:46] he can't lose a part of himself he
[41:48] cannot lose a part of himself that's the
[41:50] one impossibility as he cannot lose a
[41:53] part of himself Jesus said all that the
[41:55] father has given me has already given me
[41:58] will come to me and all that come to me
[42:00] are no wise cast out and we know the
[42:03] words of Jesus never fail he says Heaven
[42:05] and Earth may pass away but my word will
[42:07] never pass away so if he said all that
[42:10] have been given to me will come they're
[42:11] going to
[42:12] come
[42:14] Hallelujah
[42:17] now we read in so in Acts chapter 3 well
[42:20] I'll just say this before I read the
[42:21] scripture we understand we're in a time
[42:23] of
[42:24] restoration where this Fallen uh Adam's
[42:28] Fallen race is being placed back to
[42:30] where it should be in its position so
[42:33] we're in a and and in this time of
[42:35] restoration it's not just the truth of
[42:37] the scripture being restored but is the
[42:39] believer's position in Christ is being
[42:42] restored and Peter spake in Acts 3 and
[42:45] 20 and he shall send Jesus Christ which
[42:48] before was preached unto you whom the
[42:49] Heaven Must receive until the times of
[42:52] restitution of all things which God has
[42:55] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[42:57] prophets since the world began so there
[43:00] must be a restoration of a people back
[43:03] that Satan has no dominion over them but
[43:06] they have dominion over Satan oh
[43:08] hallelujah amen and we just happen to be
[43:11] living in that day and hour amen amen
[43:13] you turned up at the right time amen
[43:15] hallelujah to enjoy the full benefits of
[43:18] Calvary you turned up at the right time
[43:21] amen hallelujah hallelujah now we we
[43:24] have to understand a few things brother
[43:27] Brown tells us in in in the in the
[43:29] message pardon in 63 he says when man
[43:32] sinned in the Garden of Eden he crossed
[43:34] a great CM separating himself from the
[43:36] Eternal one man at that time was eternal
[43:39] with God he had no sickness sorrow or
[43:42] death man was not made to die yep hell
[43:46] was not made for man hell was created
[43:49] for the devil and his angels and not for
[43:52] mankind because they were created on
[43:54] Earth to be Sons and Daughters of God
[43:57] amen amen so we were not made man was
[44:00] not made for hell man was not made to be
[44:02] lost man was made amen hell was created
[44:06] the scripture tells us for the devil and
[44:07] his angels it was created for that
[44:10] purpose and that purpose
[44:12] alone and it wasn't made for mankind now
[44:15] but when man sinned and stepped across
[44:17] the boundary line between right and
[44:18] wrong he separated himself from God
[44:21] leaving himself no way back he was
[44:23] totally lost he could not come back
[44:25] because he had sinned but God rich in
[44:27] Mercy accepted a substitute because he
[44:30] had said the day you eat thereof that
[44:32] day you die and God's justice and
[44:34] Holiness required death because it's his
[44:36] word and he must keep his word in order
[44:39] to be God the love that he had for the
[44:41] human race and yet had to see them
[44:44] separated from him and the fellowship
[44:47] that he had with his children in the
[44:48] Garden of Eden and that heartbroken
[44:51] condition that he that he had to be in
[44:53] all that time because his word said the
[44:55] day you eat thereof the day you'll die
[44:57] then we can rely upon this whatever God
[45:00] says is true it must come to pass God
[45:02] cannot take his word back because he's
[45:05] infinite he's Eternal and his first
[45:07] decision is uh alltime decision he
[45:10] doesn't have to take back because he
[45:13] learned more about it so what he
[45:15] declared will be will
[45:19] be
[45:22] now in Ephesians 2 and
[45:24] 1 Paul Paul begins to uh tell the
[45:28] Believers there of their previous
[45:30] condition that they were
[45:33] once uh they were sorry my let's just go
[45:36] to Ephesians 2 and
[45:40] 1 so man remember after after Adam fell
[45:45] man has been under Dominion of
[45:48] devils it has been whether we like it or
[45:50] not man was has come into a fallen
[45:52] condition you know and we have been
[45:54] under Satan has become the Lord
[45:57] but he was never meant to be the Lord of
[45:59] mankind am mean that's why you've got to
[46:01] you've got to when when when sickness
[46:03] strikes you all sickness is from devil
[46:05] you know you know you know from Satan or
[46:07] or you become to be wward in your walk
[46:09] and you know you get a you your your
[46:11] your temper may rise or you may get
[46:13] unforgiveness in you or bitterness or
[46:14] whatever it may be you've got to
[46:16] recognize that is from that is from the
[46:18] devil and he's trying to become your
[46:20] ruler and your master because those
[46:22] things will lead you in a certain way
[46:24] and it becomes your Lord amen amen and
[46:27] so but you've got to recognize those
[46:29] things were not ordained to lead you you
[46:31] were meant to be the head and not the
[46:33] tail you are meant to be the boss and he
[46:35] has to be under your feet amen amen we
[46:37] have you God has ordained he says my
[46:40] bride will be join ear with me the
[46:42] scripture tells us we join is with
[46:43] Christ and if he's ordained the bride to
[46:45] be in that position she's going to be in
[46:47] that position and no power in Hell
[46:49] nothing on the earth or under the Earth
[46:51] can stop her Rising amen nothing can
[46:53] stop you rising to your position but you
[46:56] must recogn eyes of God's ordained me to
[46:58] be thus I'm going to be thus and nothing
[47:00] can stop it Amen brother Bram he you
[47:02] know he gave the testimony he saw a
[47:04] vision about two years before it
[47:06] happened of a of a boy that was killed
[47:08] in a car accident and he described it
[47:10] how was a foreign kind of dress and a
[47:12] very mountainous kind of country and he
[47:14] and he prayed for the boy and he came
[47:16] back to life and then when he was in
[47:17] Finland the whole scene came back to him
[47:21] and he said you could line every devil
[47:22] up in hell and it wouldn't stop that boy
[47:24] coming back to life cuz God ordained to
[47:27] come back to life am amen if that's just
[47:29] for Natural Life to Come how much more
[47:31] amen the bride of Christ coming to her
[47:34] position it has to happen there's
[47:36] nothing can stop it happening that's
[47:38] right Hallelujah but Satan will do
[47:40] everything he can but you've got to
[47:41] recognize he's not your lord sickness is
[47:44] not your lord temp is not your lord
[47:46] unforgiveness is not your lord
[47:47] bitterness is not your lord lust is not
[47:49] your lord whatever it may be that's
[47:51] that's you know some some addiction I've
[47:54] got Cravings whom the son has set free
[47:56] is free indeed when God took alcohol
[47:58] from me I never had a
[48:00] craving since that day till now amen
[48:03] amen thank you Lord hallelujah so you
[48:06] know we have to recognize these things
[48:08] have been ordained to be under our feet
[48:12] Hallelujah now and you have he quickened
[48:16] who were dead and trespassed and sins
[48:18] wherein in times past you walked
[48:19] according to the course of this world
[48:21] according to the prince of the power of
[48:23] the year that that's the spirit that now
[48:26] work work in the children of
[48:28] Disobedience among whom also you all had
[48:31] our conversation which is Manner of Life
[48:33] and Times past and the lust of our flesh
[48:35] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[48:37] of the mind and were by Nature the
[48:39] children of Wrath even as others but God
[48:42] who is rich in Mercy for his great lover
[48:44] and he loved us even when we were dead
[48:47] in in sins hath quickened us together
[48:49] with Christ by grace are you saved and
[48:52] has raised us up together and made us
[48:54] sit made us sit together in heaven ly
[48:57] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[49:00] to come he might show the exceeding
[49:01] Riches of his grace and his kindness
[49:04] towards us through Christ Jesus for by
[49:07] grace are ye saved through faith and not
[49:09] of yourselves for it is a gift of God
[49:13] not of Works lest any man should boast
[49:15] for we are his workmanship created in
[49:17] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[49:20] hath before ordained that we should walk
[49:23] in them amen if you've been ordained
[49:25] you're going to do it amen Hallelujah so
[49:27] he's saying that one time we walked
[49:29] according to the prince of the power of
[49:30] the air so we it was our Lord Satan was
[49:32] our master and so he was on he was on
[49:35] the throne of our heart but then but
[49:38] then what happened is one day the word
[49:40] came your way and the preaching of the
[49:42] true word of God dethroned Satan out of
[49:45] a person's life and then God becomes
[49:47] becomes your ruler and your Lord amen
[49:50] hallelujah so so the preaching of the
[49:52] Gospel the you know is to Dethrone Satan
[49:55] from every heart that will that will
[49:57] want to kick him out cuz you've got to
[49:58] agree to get rid of him amen if you hold
[50:01] on to him and and and and defend him
[50:03] well he's not going to be dethroned but
[50:05] if you see him for what he is and
[50:07] recognize Satan you're not meant to be
[50:09] my Lord and Master I was created to
[50:11] worship God I was created to be for God
[50:14] to be my head Hallelujah that's what
[50:16] we're created for are we not amen if we
[50:19] you know if you recognize that then then
[50:22] Satan must go that's right Hallelujah so
[50:25] and one times past he was our Lord but
[50:27] now he's not our Lord that's right one
[50:29] times we walked according to what he
[50:31] made us do but now we do not that's
[50:33] right amen because someone else is
[50:34] taking up residence and nothing is
[50:37] greater than our God Amen
[50:40] Hallelujah now that's what he that's
[50:44] what was uh that's what has happened I
[50:47] trust it's happened to you amen amen
[50:49] then then in Galatians it says that we
[50:52] were you know we were under tutors and
[50:55] governors until the time appointed to
[50:56] the father is Galatians 4:1 even so we
[50:59] when we were children were in bondage
[51:01] under the elements of the world but when
[51:03] the fullness of the time was come God
[51:05] sent forth a son made of a woman made
[51:06] under the law to redeem them that were
[51:09] under the law that we might receive the
[51:11] adoption or placing of sons and this is
[51:14] the hour where the Sons and Daughters of
[51:16] God receive their placing or adoption
[51:18] amen because if you look at that Greek
[51:20] word it means a placing and adoption is
[51:21] a placing amen it doesn't mean that you
[51:24] were not relation to the father
[51:27] amen because it says in the scripture
[51:28] because you were Sons he sent forth the
[51:30] spirit where you cry Abba Father because
[51:32] you were not because you
[51:34] became amen you know we have to really I
[51:38] I I trust this really mean something to
[51:39] you a little bit you know we don't
[51:41] become Sons and Daughters of God because
[51:43] we accepted oh Jesus you died for me the
[51:46] reason you accepted and he and he
[51:47] transforms your life is because you were
[51:50] amen he saw through the space of time he
[51:52] knew when you wouldd be born he says
[51:54] there's my child there's my son there's
[51:56] my daughter and Now's the Time
[51:58] acceptable where I'm going to meet them
[52:00] and they're going to recognize that this
[52:02] is not their family their natural family
[52:05] even you know but their real parent is
[52:07] me amen the real parent is me I'm their
[52:10] father I'm their mother I birth them
[52:12] into the world Hallelujah that's why
[52:15] it's so such a powerful thing when when
[52:17] when something in you says I know I'm a
[52:19] child of the king am I know I'm I you
[52:21] know and it's not a mental thing but
[52:23] something in your soul says I know Lord
[52:25] Jesus you birth me forth I'm part of you
[52:29] amen we have the same DNA not natural
[52:31] DNA now but in our souls amen amen
[52:34] that's right if you're a child of the
[52:36] king you cannot unbecome a child of the
[52:39] king amen and if you I put it the other
[52:42] way I don't believe I'm talking to
[52:43] anyone here but if you're not a child of
[52:44] the king you never will be but if all
[52:47] that come to me no wise cast out amen
[52:51] hallelujah
[52:53] so what security so we don't become
[52:57] wait and because you are Sons God sent
[53:00] forth the spirit of a son into your
[53:01] hearts crying Abba Father or my father
[53:03] my father wherein Thou Art no more a
[53:06] servant but a son and if a in the a of
[53:09] God through Christ how be it then when
[53:12] you knew not God you did service unto
[53:14] them which by Nature are no Gods so you
[53:18] serve something we all serve something
[53:20] there was actually not meant to be a God
[53:22] but we we put ourselves under the thing
[53:25] and did obedience to it and it became
[53:27] Our God amen amen
[53:31] by but now after that you you have known
[53:34] God or rather known of God how turn you
[53:37] again to the weak and bigly elements
[53:39] wherein you desire again to be in
[53:41] bondage so Paul is saying you are Sons
[53:45] he made you Sons why are you turning
[53:47] back and serving a
[53:48] religion amen CU they try to mix the LA
[53:52] in with Grace remember Grace is a Divine
[53:54] influence upon the heart to to live the
[53:56] word that's what Grace is amen amen
[53:59] God's Great Grace like Lord I'm Bound
[54:01] free me and he frees you that's his
[54:02] grace Lord help me I want to serve you
[54:04] and he and he anoints you and and now
[54:06] you can serve him amen it's his
[54:09] ability Hallelujah I'm glad that's the
[54:12] case Hallelujah now that's why in this
[54:15] hour there's in Zechariah there's a
[54:17] scripture it says we will bring forth
[54:18] the head headstone where C Grace Grace
[54:21] unto us amen cuz when Christ comes to
[54:23] cap off his church the Believers when
[54:25] they see the head Stone coming down and
[54:27] he's come down upon many he's kept many
[54:30] but when you see him come down what's
[54:31] that that's the baptism of the Holy
[54:33] Ghost I me but when you see him come
[54:34] down all you can cry is Grace Grace amen
[54:37] that's not yeah I deserved it all you
[54:38] say is Grace Grace with shoutings amen
[54:40] with glory and
[54:42] Thanksgiving Hallelujah glory to his
[54:45] name now this whole world this whole all
[54:47] of nature is in bondage to to to
[54:50] Darkness that's why nature is falling
[54:52] apart because Satan has got into Fallen
[54:54] man and has caused us world to fall
[54:56] apart like it is that's why people don't
[54:59] like it but the truth is man is
[55:02] inherently evil yes that's right man in
[55:04] his Fallen condition is inherently evil
[55:07] if man was inherently good we would have
[55:09] a Eden upon the Earth we would have a
[55:11] millennium cuz we have the technology to
[55:14] eradicate all all poverty we have the
[55:16] ability to feed every mouth amen we have
[55:19] the ability to eradicate diseases where
[55:22] they say oh it's such an epidemic but
[55:24] the drug companies hold back things
[55:27] people are dying in third world
[55:29] countries and rich people in the west
[55:30] are saying no I'm not going to give you
[55:31] the drug they could synthesize it they
[55:35] could do it we spend a lot I spent a lot
[55:37] of time University studying synthetic
[55:39] chemistry how they make how they produce
[55:42] drugs but they what they do is companies
[55:45] they put a copyright or a patent on a
[55:47] certain molecule and that means other
[55:49] companies can't come and just change a
[55:51] little bit to perhaps improve it and
[55:53] it's stuck like that and they won't just
[55:54] make it open source if man was
[55:57] inherently good it would become open
[55:59] source how's your billion dollars profit
[56:02] awesome but you're killing you're
[56:04] allowing people to
[56:05] die and people are
[56:08] starving the world produces more food
[56:10] than it needs but yet we have
[56:14] famine countries will spend billions of
[56:17] dollars on weapons that can wipe out
[56:19] hemispheres and yet we have
[56:22] poverty what is wrong cuz man is under
[56:24] the Dominion of Satan that's right amen
[56:28] man is under that
[56:31] dominion and so but it says in Romans
[56:35] 8:16 the spirit itself beareth witness
[56:37] with our spirit that we are the children
[56:39] of God Amen and if children then ears
[56:43] and ears of God and Joint ears with
[56:45] Christ if so be that we suffer that we
[56:48] may also be glorified together for I
[56:51] reckon the
[56:52] sufferings of this present time
[56:56] so I need to go to the this is go to
[56:59] Romans
[57:00] 8 I have a
[57:02] confession the color ink and my printer
[57:06] ran out I can't see half the
[57:08] [Music]
[57:09] words that's all right God Marches On
[57:13] amen
[57:16] amen 8 and 16 so not creation itself is
[57:21] is waiting for us to come to our
[57:23] position it says for I reckon the
[57:25] sufferings of the present time wait
[57:27] where are we and if okay yes for so
[57:30] Verse 18 for I reckon that the
[57:31] sufferings of this present time are not
[57:32] worthy to be compared with the glory
[57:34] that shall be revealed in us for the
[57:36] earnest expectation of the creature
[57:38] which is that word is creation waiteth
[57:40] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[57:43] or the revealing for the creation was
[57:46] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[57:49] by reason of him who hath subjected the
[57:52] same in Hope because the creature itself
[57:54] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[57:56] of corruption and to the Glorious
[57:58] Liberty of the children of God for we
[58:00] know that the whole creation granth and
[58:02] travaileth and pain together until now
[58:05] and not only they but ourselves also
[58:08] which have the first fruits of the
[58:09] spirit even ourselves grown within
[58:12] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[58:14] the Redemption of our body so the whole
[58:18] creation is groaning and waiting waiting
[58:21] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[58:23] because it's looking for Adam to return
[58:26] it's looking for Adam and Eve to return
[58:28] and take their
[58:29] position and we happen to be living in
[58:31] that hour amen amen so we read there
[58:34] that Satan uh so just just backtracking
[58:37] so Satan desired to become like the most
[58:40] high he wanted he wanted to become like
[58:44] God and it says in the scripture the God
[58:47] of this evil agees blinded the people so
[58:50] he has his his intention there before
[58:53] the foundation of the world to become
[58:55] like the most high has become manifested
[58:58] but that is not the end of the story
[58:59] there's always a to be continued and the
[59:02] final chapter of the story is that he
[59:03] will be cast down amen amen into the pit
[59:07] you know down into hell into the sides
[59:09] of the pit and we read the scripture
[59:11] there that they that see thee shall
[59:12] narrowly look upon thee so it doesn't
[59:14] say everyone will see him but they that
[59:16] see him and we see him in this hour amen
[59:18] cuz we see his workings we can identify
[59:20] now that's the devil that's the devil
[59:22] that's the devil you know because the
[59:24] word has come to EXP expose Satan's
[59:26] workings that's why brother said with
[59:28] the opening of the seals he says we're
[59:30] just stripping him down we're exposing
[59:32] him so you can see what he was doing in
[59:34] Genesis you can see in the middle of the
[59:36] Bible and you can see at the end of the
[59:37] Bible yes I mean you can see from
[59:39] Calvary to now the workings of Satan and
[59:42] how he's uh Bewitched the whole world
[59:45] and we can look at those things and say
[59:46] that's just the devil veiled you know he
[59:49] you know he's he he's hidden an open
[59:51] view or you know Plain View but the
[59:53] world gets caught up in all these
[59:55] different things but we can see it for
[59:56] what it is and it's not conspiracy cuz
[59:58] it's in the scripture amen that's right
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:01] so these whole things so that's not the
[1:00:05] end of the
[1:00:06] story but he will come down to nothing
[1:00:09] he will fall from his position he
[1:00:12] exalted himself above he says I'll make
[1:00:14] my throne above the stars of God but
[1:00:17] that would not be his final resting
[1:00:19] place but his final resting places will
[1:00:22] be a lake of fire amen but we have to
[1:00:27] uh there has to be a group of people
[1:00:29] that in their lives cast down Satan now
[1:00:31] this is the age of the dethroning of
[1:00:34] Satan this is the age of the casting
[1:00:36] down of his kingdom amen this is the age
[1:00:38] of where Satan is under the feet of the
[1:00:40] believer in every fcet amen amen amen
[1:00:43] that is this is the hour we're living in
[1:00:45] where where the bride of Christ has
[1:00:48] dominion over her enemy yes sir you know
[1:00:50] we read in Genesis the first prophecy of
[1:00:52] jesus' coming was the seed of the woman
[1:00:55] will bruise the head the seed of The
[1:00:56] Serpent and that was the first promise
[1:00:58] of Jesus coming in the flesh to undo
[1:01:01] everything The Serpent and the devil
[1:01:03] thre the serpent did and so now we must
[1:01:07] understand one thing the husband and the
[1:01:09] wife are one amen so what the husband is
[1:01:12] the wife is what the wife is the husband
[1:01:14] is because they're identified together
[1:01:17] you know a it's very you know simple if
[1:01:21] you think about it a male dog and a
[1:01:24] female dog have the same kind of
[1:01:25] character
[1:01:26] istics amen monkey and monkey you know
[1:01:29] everything male and female they have all
[1:01:30] the same kind of characteristics so if
[1:01:32] God is looking for a people he'll be
[1:01:35] looking for a people that have the same
[1:01:37] characteristics as him the same way as
[1:01:40] him so now if the husband if the man is
[1:01:43] a serpent Bruiser amen if the husband is
[1:01:46] the one who is a devil defeater amen who
[1:01:49] who prove his dominion over Satan and
[1:01:52] all the Devils under him over nature
[1:01:54] over death over everything sickness that
[1:01:56] was what he demonstrated in the days of
[1:01:58] his flesh Hallelujah that's why I read
[1:02:01] the scripture he was demonstrating I'm
[1:02:03] God in flesh and I have dominion over
[1:02:06] you Satan I can bind you I can loose you
[1:02:09] I know I say it many times but Moses was
[1:02:12] a type of the seed of the woman you know
[1:02:15] as a shadow and he came into he you know
[1:02:17] he you know he came into Egypt Egypt was
[1:02:19] a superpower of the of the world Pharaoh
[1:02:22] believed he was God the Pharaohs
[1:02:24] believed they were God so was Satan and
[1:02:26] pharaoh and God in Moses and he came
[1:02:29] there the first thing he did is he cast
[1:02:31] down his rod and became a serpent I
[1:02:32] believe it would have become a cobra
[1:02:34] because the Cobra was the emblem of the
[1:02:36] Pharaoh and he and he loosed him and
[1:02:38] then he picked that you know and then he
[1:02:40] picked out by the tail Aaron did and it
[1:02:42] became a rod and he was demonstrating to
[1:02:44] Satan I can loose you I can bind you I
[1:02:46] have dominion and then he said and then
[1:02:48] Pharaoh said I won't let your people go
[1:02:50] so God said I'm just going to reain
[1:02:51] curse upon you I'm going to curse your
[1:02:53] Gods that's why the curses fell on the
[1:02:55] night
[1:02:56] and he brought the Flies and he brought
[1:02:58] the flogs and the Darkness and all those
[1:03:00] things he was demonstrating every God
[1:03:02] you have exalted I have brought down
[1:03:04] that they would know that God is God
[1:03:07] hallelujah and he delivered his people
[1:03:09] but it wasn't just the end of it now
[1:03:11] after 40 years in the wilderness a
[1:03:13] generation Rose that's right and they
[1:03:15] believed that they weren't slaves and
[1:03:17] they believe they were the promised ones
[1:03:19] and they believe they were the sons and
[1:03:21] daughters of God and they believe they
[1:03:23] could take the land and that same God
[1:03:25] that delivered them out of Egypt now
[1:03:26] Came Upon a generation hallelujah
[1:03:28] hallelujah hello generation and they
[1:03:31] took land and they and they broke down
[1:03:33] Jericho and they defeated the enemy and
[1:03:35] Joshua standing there said Sun stand
[1:03:37] still Moon stand still until we defeat
[1:03:39] our foes what was that now God inspiring
[1:03:42] a man never been written before but he
[1:03:44] inspired to do it he felt led to do it
[1:03:46] nature obeyed the voice of a man under
[1:03:48] the blood of bulls and ghosts Hallelujah
[1:03:50] wasn't even a prophet just a man in his
[1:03:52] position and if that was the case under
[1:03:54] the blood of bulls and goat how much
[1:03:56] more the Bride of Jesus Christ amen how
[1:03:59] much more those who become join ear with
[1:04:01] Christ the Old Testament Believers were
[1:04:03] not join ear cuz they're under the blood
[1:04:05] of bulls and goats they could never
[1:04:07] animal blood you with me animal blood
[1:04:10] could never elevate a people above sin
[1:04:12] it just covered their sin so it could
[1:04:14] never raise them up but the blood of
[1:04:16] Jesus Christ doesn't just cover sin it
[1:04:18] annihilate sin it annihilates your past
[1:04:21] it annihilates your first birth the you
[1:04:23] know the court of Heaven has no record
[1:04:25] of of anything you've ever done I mean
[1:04:27] once you come under the blood of Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ and by coming under that now well
[1:04:32] how do you come under that the spirit of
[1:04:33] God comes into you well how do I do that
[1:04:35] you give a full surrender every facet
[1:04:37] Lord take me and make me thine amen and
[1:04:40] that lifts you up now so you're a joint
[1:04:43] ear Hallelujah so here's the first Adams
[1:04:45] that was just in type that's why the
[1:04:47] prophets could come and Elijah could
[1:04:50] stand there on Mount carel and Just sh
[1:04:52] down you know kill all the old uh
[1:04:54] prophets of baale and do what they did
[1:04:56] they did great exploits amen amen cuz
[1:04:58] that was now the serpent Bruiser was
[1:05:00] coming down am mean David could take
[1:05:02] full possession of the promised land but
[1:05:05] that was just in Shadow and then now the
[1:05:08] the real serpent Bruiser Jesus Christ
[1:05:10] came and he didn't just have dominion
[1:05:12] over a natural enemy but Satan Was
[1:05:16] Defeated amen all the devils in hell you
[1:05:18] got to remember if the head Devils
[1:05:20] defeated all the ones under them are
[1:05:22] defeated and that day on Calvary when
[1:05:24] when when the Stinger of death was
[1:05:26] yanked out of his side amen youo the
[1:05:28] devil was no he would have been
[1:05:30] rejoicing I finally got him I couldn't
[1:05:32] get him when he casted me out of here I
[1:05:34] had a legion of people and one of his
[1:05:35] children but they got cast out you know
[1:05:38] he just said a word and they had to go
[1:05:40] but now I've got him he's hanging there
[1:05:43] and then death came this big buzzing bee
[1:05:45] coming around with it Stinger saying and
[1:05:47] he's probably no doubt saying I'm going
[1:05:48] to enjoy this one I enjoy putting it
[1:05:51] into Moses I enjoy putting it into
[1:05:53] Joshua and King David and all those ones
[1:05:55] but now I'm really going to get one I'm
[1:05:56] going to enjoy it and he what you know
[1:05:58] how the devil does he likes to relish
[1:05:59] things you know but then he put the
[1:06:01] stinger and then an invisible hand came
[1:06:04] he couldn't pull it outall remember when
[1:06:06] a bee rips a your rips a stinger out it
[1:06:08] begins to die Hallelujah it begins to
[1:06:11] die amen and now our Prophet your
[1:06:14] Prophet told you Satan is like an animal
[1:06:16] with a broken back after Calvary have
[1:06:19] you ever seen an animal with a broken
[1:06:20] back it has no control it has no control
[1:06:23] Hallelujah
[1:06:26] now if that was the if that was the
[1:06:28] groom I'm going to read some
[1:06:31] things he says
[1:06:33] this
[1:06:36] now God this is from it's the rising of
[1:06:41] the Sun God has never separated the
[1:06:43] bride from the groom yet this speaking
[1:06:45] on Calvary so when God looked down upon
[1:06:47] the body of Christ he he saw both male
[1:06:50] and female it was all redeemed in that
[1:06:52] one body see they are one the same word
[1:06:55] the the same word spoke of the groom
[1:06:57] speaks of the Bride how can the Bride
[1:07:00] come and fail to manifest everything
[1:07:01] that was promised of him and the groom
[1:07:04] came and he uh and he wouldn't be for
[1:07:07] the bride and when he did everything
[1:07:09] even to proving it by raising himself up
[1:07:13] from the dead afterwards um the bride
[1:07:16] have to do the same thing have to be
[1:07:18] exactly what the word said should be in
[1:07:20] these last days you following me don't
[1:07:23] she have to return through Malachi 4
[1:07:26] don't you have to be manifested like it
[1:07:27] was in the days of Sodom don't the word
[1:07:30] world have to be exactly like this isn't
[1:07:33] these things a perfect identification of
[1:07:35] God made known to us so he says the word
[1:07:39] that speaks for the groom speaks for the
[1:07:40] bride see here here's the first Adam had
[1:07:43] dominion over everything he did perfect
[1:07:46] Dominion amen amen he was he was tired
[1:07:50] in a boat back of a boat all those
[1:07:52] Devils because remember the devil
[1:07:54] controls mhm the weather that's why we
[1:07:57] have the typhoons and all these terrible
[1:07:58] things so he's asleep in the back of a
[1:08:00] boat weary from the meetings he's had
[1:08:02] all the Devils swore th drown him now
[1:08:04] we'll get him and now there was a power
[1:08:06] battle who really made who really made
[1:08:08] nature who really made nature and so and
[1:08:11] so here's the devil believing he's in
[1:08:13] control whips up a big storm the
[1:08:15] disciples are scared but they have Jesus
[1:08:17] in the boat with them hello disciples
[1:08:19] how are we today and then so they got
[1:08:21] all scared but then they woke him up
[1:08:23] we'll perish and he just says peace be
[1:08:25] still he didn't say B he said peace be
[1:08:28] still and the winds and waves had to
[1:08:30] obey him the creation the you the
[1:08:33] creation had to obey the voice of the
[1:08:35] Creator and God was demonstrating I made
[1:08:38] this that's right because the thing that
[1:08:40] you know the one that makes it is in
[1:08:42] control so he was demonstrating devil
[1:08:45] you didn't make this this is not yours
[1:08:47] this is mine I'm showing on you know
[1:08:49] showing I'm in
[1:08:51] control how much more now that's the he
[1:08:54] had Dominion over death he had dominion
[1:08:57] over all manner of disease every every
[1:09:00] disease and he had dominion over
[1:09:03] nature amen and he had dominion over his
[1:09:05] own flesh amen hallelujah amen if that's
[1:09:09] for the bride how much I mean for the
[1:09:11] groom how much more the bride amen by
[1:09:14] his sacrifice on Calvary it elevates her
[1:09:17] into a position remember we're not
[1:09:19] called to be servants we're not the
[1:09:20] devil's slaves amen amen we're not
[1:09:22] called to be the devil's slaves if
[1:09:24] you're a slave to the devil
[1:09:26] you're out of your position let this be
[1:09:28] a change in position service
[1:09:31] amen and so we're not ordained to be
[1:09:34] those things but he's ordained to be
[1:09:36] under us
[1:09:37] amen the same
[1:09:39] thing

[1:10:27] be in the grave they'll go and the
[1:10:29] trumpet of God shall sound the dead in
[1:10:31] Christ shall rise first and we which are

[1:10:43] Christ there's quickening power upon
[1:10:44] them that same spirit is upon us amen
[1:10:47] the same quickening power presented in
[1:10:50] both of these prophets Elijah and Elisha
[1:10:52] that same quickening power look their
[1:10:54] names are almost the same Elisha and
[1:10:57] Elijah see the bride and the groom one
[1:11:00] of them is Mr Jesus represents Mr Jesus
[1:11:04] the other one is Mrs Jesus see amen
[1:11:07] almost the same Elijah see how
[1:11:10] represented there now Elisha was taken
[1:11:12] up I mean Elijah was taken up in the
[1:11:14] Rapture so the same The Same Spirit that
[1:11:17] was upon Elijah Came Upon
[1:11:20] Elisha amen and that is a that that
[1:11:23] represents Elijah represents Christ and
[1:11:24] Elisha represents us that's it and
[1:11:27] elishah did twice the amount of Miracles
[1:11:29] as Elijah did amen but the same life
[1:11:32] that was on him was on Elisha Hallelujah
[1:11:36] and
[1:11:37] Elisha the same God did the same things
[1:11:41] in the same ways amen
[1:11:46] amen and he's saying it's the same thing
[1:11:48] as you the bride and I mean the groom
[1:11:50] and you
[1:11:52] amen now there's a modern events made
[1:11:55] clear by prophecy I happen to believe
[1:11:57] what he say that's why I'm reading these
[1:11:59] things these things are powerful because
[1:12:02] we have to something has to click in us
[1:12:04] saying that we're he's made us joint
[1:12:06] ears yes joint ears so everything he did
[1:12:10] we fall a too amen so if he had Dominion
[1:12:13] If he if he conquered hell death in the
[1:12:15] grave because of a joint a we fall a to
[1:12:17] it amen hallelujah amen notice now they
[1:12:21] had done to him just exactly what the
[1:12:22] prophet said they would do just as they
[1:12:24] would doing just as they are doing in
[1:12:27] this very same day in the Lan age if you
[1:12:30] want to look at it read Revelations 3
[1:12:32] blind naked and don't know it when he
[1:12:36] begins to reveal himself in the seed
[1:12:37] form again the same one that went into
[1:12:40] the ground come back to be the bride
[1:12:42] just the bride and the groom is the same
[1:12:45] Flesh and Blood the same Ministry the
[1:12:47] same things doing exactly what he done
[1:12:51] so he's saying the same thing you read
[1:12:52] about in the book of Acts and in the
[1:12:53] gospels you will demonstrated again that
[1:12:57] same life producing the same life will
[1:12:59] be back again with the same Ministry
[1:13:02] amen the same things doing exactly just
[1:13:05] what he done and we see it around the
[1:13:06] world I mean we as a people coming to
[1:13:09] their position Satan is being Dethrone
[1:13:12] hallelujah amen I trust you can identify
[1:13:15] you can identify with what God is doing
[1:13:17] not that yester you would just agree
[1:13:18] with it but you see your life is in
[1:13:20] unity with what's going
[1:13:22] on Hallelujah
[1:13:26] now you say
[1:13:29] well I'm just a little old
[1:13:32] me but you got to see what Jesus has
[1:13:34] made you what what you ordained to be
[1:13:39] amen what are you ordained to be cuz if
[1:13:41] he's ordained you to be a certain thing
[1:13:42] you have to be it because all of all of
[1:13:46] Heaven is behind you coming into your
[1:13:49] position nothing can stop nothing in
[1:13:51] this hour can stop his kingdom
[1:13:53] come Hallelujah it's like a you know
[1:13:57] brother B tells a story about a little
[1:14:00] policeman 2x4 little guy with a badge he
[1:14:04] says the policeman doesn't have the
[1:14:05] power to stop the traffic but he's got
[1:14:08] the authority to stop the traffic
[1:14:10] because all the city is behind that
[1:14:12] policeman if that's just a little bit of
[1:14:14] policeman with a natural law behind him
[1:14:17] how much more are people Redeemed by the
[1:14:19] blood where all of Heaven is behind that
[1:14:22] person I mean we may not have the power
[1:14:24] but we have the Authority amen God when
[1:14:26] you became a Believer God gave you the
[1:14:29] badge of a Believer and all you have to
[1:14:31] do is hold up that badge and say Satan
[1:14:33] amen I'm a Believer that's right see
[1:14:35] this this is the Seal of the king the
[1:14:37] king of Heaven that cast you out
[1:14:40] Hallelujah and he has to obey your voice
[1:14:42] that's right I believe it I mean let's
[1:14:45] go to Revelations chapter
[1:14:47] 12
[1:14:54] just here's a reason why I'm repeating
[1:14:56] myself I really want this to sink in you
[1:14:58] got to you got it's not just singing
[1:15:01] dominions being given to the family of
[1:15:02] the king something's got to Anchor in I
[1:15:04] have dominion I have the authority every
[1:15:09] devil must be under my feet amen Angels
[1:15:13] were never made to take your place amen
[1:15:15] angels have nothing to do with
[1:15:17] Redemption they when when we're gathered
[1:15:19] around the throne or even now when we
[1:15:21] sing about redemption in the blood they
[1:15:22] don't know what we're talking about they
[1:15:24] may know oh yeah that happened and we
[1:15:26] saw that happen there but they don't
[1:15:28] know what it's like to be redeemed Jesus
[1:15:30] never died for Angels God never became
[1:15:33] flesh for Angel's Redemption he came for
[1:15:35] your Redemption amen he came to redeem
[1:15:37] his family back to the position they
[1:15:39] meant to be in right amen that's right
[1:15:41] so they won't know we we dwell in a
[1:15:43] position that Angels know nothing about
[1:15:45] you mean even Gabriel and the archangels
[1:15:48] and all those incredible yeah they don't
[1:15:50] know what we are they're just servants
[1:15:52] they're not part of the family
[1:15:55] whole totally different category and if
[1:15:58] Satan was created as the anointed Cher
[1:16:00] that cth as he says in Ezekiel he's just
[1:16:02] a servant yeah that's right he knows he
[1:16:04] knows nothing of the position we in you
[1:16:07] and I are in now amen that's right
[1:16:11] Revelations chap
[1:16:13] 12 and verse
[1:16:15] 7 now we sorry just before we read this
[1:16:18] we understand that God made all the
[1:16:20] Angels before there was anything he made
[1:16:21] angels to worship him and then Lucifer
[1:16:24] and his in his heart iniquity was found
[1:16:27] but before that he preached to the
[1:16:28] angels and some of them believed his lie
[1:16:30] and fell with him yeah that's why and
[1:16:34] those angels those fallen angels are
[1:16:35] demon Spirits that's right yeah that's
[1:16:38] right and there was war in heaven
[1:16:40] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:16:41] the dragon and the dragon fought in his
[1:16:43] angels and prevailed not neither was
[1:16:46] there Place found anymore in heaven
[1:16:49] right and the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:16:51] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:16:52] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[1:16:55] was cast out into the Earth and his
[1:16:57] angels were cast out with him and I
[1:17:00] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:17:01] has come salvation and strength and the
[1:17:04] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:17:06] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:17:09] is cast down which accuses them before
[1:17:11] our God day and night and they overcame
[1:17:14] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:17:16] word of their testimony and they loved
[1:17:19] not their lives until the death
[1:17:21] therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:17:23] dwell in them woe to the inhabitant of
[1:17:25] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[1:17:27] has come down unto you having great
[1:17:29] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[1:17:31] but a short time so Satan elevates
[1:17:36] himself there's war and he's cast down
[1:17:39] and then now he's come down to the Earth
[1:17:41] so the battle goes from an Angelic
[1:17:43] battle down to the realm of human being
[1:17:45] but there's a people upon the Earth he
[1:17:47] was defeated in heaven he is cast down
[1:17:50] to the Earth but there's a people that
[1:17:52] overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[1:17:54] and and the word of their testimony and
[1:17:57] he's defeated here amen I'm in that
[1:17:59] number I can't sing but not in that
[1:18:01] blood wash number you in that number
[1:18:04] Hallelujah there's a people this
[1:18:06] scripture must become manifested that's
[1:18:08] right amen and we understand that
[1:18:10] through Through the Ages it has but it
[1:18:13] has to come to a final you know it has
[1:18:15] to come to a
[1:18:17] finality amen where there is a people a
[1:18:20] final living generation that overcome
[1:18:22] him by the blood of lamb and the word of
[1:18:24] their testimony
[1:18:25] you say
[1:18:27] well our testimony is not just what God
[1:18:30] has done for us but we are to testify or
[1:18:33] give witness that God's word is true
[1:18:35] amen so everything that is contrary to
[1:18:38] his word you got to cast down am mean
[1:18:41] you got to take God at his word doesn't
[1:18:43] matter what situation we may be in but
[1:18:46] is to give testimony that his word is
[1:18:49] right because if you begin to testify of
[1:18:52] things that are not his word then Satan
[1:18:54] come in and have dominion over you you
[1:18:57] see it's in first I think it's in first
[1:18:58] or second Kings you know there's the
[1:19:01] king of Israel and there's the king of
[1:19:03] Judah or whatever it is one's Ahab and
[1:19:06] Elijah's prophesied that the dogs will
[1:19:08] lick this man's blood he's going to die
[1:19:10] he's been he and he's brought out to
[1:19:13] this battle and he's got 400 prophets
[1:19:15] and the he and and they all of One mind
[1:19:17] and one Accord prophesying go up and
[1:19:20] take ramoth Gilead the Lord's given it
[1:19:22] into your hand remember ramoth gillad
[1:19:24] was a part of his Israel it's God's
[1:19:25] given ground the enemy had taken the
[1:19:27] ground and they're all getting excited
[1:19:30] they were they were having a real time
[1:19:31] and the head the head Prophet made two
[1:19:33] horns made a sign and begin to say with
[1:19:35] these you'll push out the enemy that
[1:19:37] sounds pretty good but then now Micaiah
[1:19:40] was there and then I think it's
[1:19:42] Jehoshaphat I think he was the good King
[1:19:44] he says don't you have just one more he
[1:19:47] says there is one more but he you know
[1:19:50] but he always Propet you know you know
[1:19:51] prophesies against me I hate him and the
[1:19:53] other king says don't let the king say
[1:19:56] so go get him so now we're going to see
[1:19:59] we're going to see now who has
[1:20:01] Dominion this is where it comes down to
[1:20:03] Everyday Life who has Dominion
[1:20:06] now and then so a guy goes and gets him
[1:20:08] he says you say what these like these
[1:20:10] Prophet said them we have Fellowship
[1:20:11] again this Prophet says I'll only say m
[1:20:14] says I'll only say have you pronounce
[1:20:16] his name I'll only say what God puts in
[1:20:18] my mouth he comes along and he praise
[1:20:21] God comes upon him and he says now okay
[1:20:25] now tell us what God told you go up the
[1:20:26] Lord's given you the land and Ahab says
[1:20:28] don't you see always prophesies against
[1:20:30] me he says now I saw heaven and God was
[1:20:34] saying how can we get Ahab to come and
[1:20:36] and die because the words of Elijah have
[1:20:37] to be fulfilled and then a lying Spirit
[1:20:40] comes out from
[1:20:42] Hell says I'll get into them they don't
[1:20:45] know the word basically they don't know
[1:20:48] what's prophesy of the day and hour in
[1:20:49] which they live and a lying Spirit came
[1:20:52] down upon them and they are enthus and
[1:20:54] they anointed now what was what was
[1:20:56] their lord just then amen lying Spirit
[1:21:00] that's right that's why you've got to
[1:21:01] take your thoughts and everything got to
[1:21:03] be subject to the word of God Amen they
[1:21:06] were Israelites they were prophets but
[1:21:07] they were led the wrong way that's right
[1:21:11] and
[1:21:12] so and we know the outcome and the head
[1:21:15] Prophet was so angry he smacks the other
[1:21:17] guy in the mouth when did the spirit of
[1:21:19] God come out of me and go unto you and
[1:21:21] then the king Ahab says take this man
[1:21:23] feed him water of affliction and bread
[1:21:24] of Affliction put him in prison till I
[1:21:26] come back then that Prophet looked at
[1:21:28] that King King ABAB says if you ever
[1:21:30] come back again the Lord has never
[1:21:31] spoken to me amen cuz he says I see
[1:21:35] Israel scattered like sheep without a
[1:21:37] shepherd on the Hills amen and it
[1:21:39] happened exactly because the word of
[1:21:41] Elijah had to be
[1:21:43] fulfilled amen so we have to you got to
[1:21:47] really think about oh you're I'm
[1:21:48] enthused about something the world gets
[1:21:51] enthused have they ever anointed their
[1:21:53] American Messiah yeah
[1:21:55] you see on YouTube all the all the
[1:21:56] church leaders praying for him and
[1:21:58] things you know before he became
[1:22:00] president they have they have theyve
[1:22:02] selected their Messiah and the word's
[1:22:05] got to be
[1:22:06] fulfilled amen but what about
[1:22:10] us there has to
[1:22:12] be there has to be people that overcome
[1:22:15] him by the blood of lamb and the word of
[1:22:16] their
[1:22:17] testimony amen there has to be and we I
[1:22:22] trust by God's grace that we are part of
[1:22:24] that number amen amen because Satan he
[1:22:29] was cast out of Heaven he was defeated
[1:22:31] there he has to be defeated here amen
[1:22:34] and there has to be the Battle Is Now
[1:22:35] put on human
[1:22:37] flesh amen that's right
[1:22:45] amen Jesus gave instructions in the end
[1:22:48] of Mark
[1:22:49] 16 go into all the world and preach the
[1:22:52] gospel and these son shall follow them
[1:22:53] that believe you cast out Devils speak
[1:22:56] with you tongues if you drink any deadly
[1:22:58] thing it shall not harm you you know
[1:23:00] that was the instructions that was that
[1:23:02] is the gospel in action so he says go
[1:23:04] into all the world and Dethrone Satan
[1:23:07] out of every life that will believe
[1:23:09] preach it to Every Creature but everyone
[1:23:10] that believes Dethrone him and that's
[1:23:13] our standing
[1:23:15] orders that's what we're ordained to
[1:23:17] do amen
[1:23:20] amen just bear with me a bit
[1:23:23] longer okay you got to recognize I just
[1:23:27] it's got to punch home an addiction
[1:23:31] something of the flesh something that is
[1:23:33] robbing you of your walk with God that
[1:23:35] is not ordained to be your ruler amen oh
[1:23:38] but I but I love the Lord and I you know
[1:23:42] and I'm religious don't don't let him
[1:23:44] rob you of your walk because you're not
[1:23:47] ordained to be his slave he is ordained
[1:23:51] to be under your feet amen amen
[1:23:57] brother brah says here and unbelief does
[1:24:00] not hinder God but today we have the
[1:24:03] privilege of coming beyond the Angels
[1:24:06] because Jesus never died for angels
[1:24:08] angels are servants and by the blood of
[1:24:10] Jesus we are Sons and
[1:24:13] Daughters says in the angel of God in
[1:24:16] 48 he says now we unworthy Mortals have
[1:24:19] been bought to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:24:21] God to be fellow citizens I get to
[1:24:23] shouting notice into that realm where
[1:24:25] even angels can't come you say Angels
[1:24:28] yes sir we're Sons and Daughters angels
[1:24:30] are servants that's right servants
[1:24:32] cannot go to where Sons and Daughters
[1:24:33] will go they cannot enter into that
[1:24:36] relationship for their servants and we
[1:24:38] Sons and
[1:24:39] Daughters amen who has more power before
[1:24:43] God what uh what is an angel and Angels
[1:24:46] a servant is right there his servants
[1:24:49] what are you his son and daughter who
[1:24:51] has the most power in heaven then yes am
[1:24:53] you thought about
[1:24:54] a sinner that's been saved by grace or
[1:24:57] an archangel that's standing by his
[1:24:59] right side The Sinner that's been saved
[1:25:01] by grace is more Authority in heaven
[1:25:04] than the Archangel that stood by his
[1:25:05] side without sin because he's a son a
[1:25:10] son has more Authority than a servant of
[1:25:12] course we forget what we are that's
[1:25:14] right amen we forget many times what
[1:25:17] made us what we are Hallelujah after we
[1:25:20] become what we are then we forget how we
[1:25:24] got
[1:25:24] here that's why it's so important things
[1:25:27] begin to go Wayward think back on where
[1:25:30] God has brought you and think back on
[1:25:32] what he's done for you amen now there's
[1:25:35] a Scene It says now we read there in in
[1:25:38] in Revelations 12 that the accuser of
[1:25:41] the Brethren is cast down so there was a
[1:25:45] time now where
[1:25:48] Satan Heavenly places is the believer's
[1:25:51] position in
[1:25:52] Christ so there was that time where Adam
[1:25:55] was in that position but then he fell
[1:25:57] and Satan took that position and that's
[1:26:00] why we see all the Carnage around us but
[1:26:03] then now by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:06] now there's a dethroning of Satan and
[1:26:08] the believer comes into his or her true
[1:26:10] position in Christ where we are we read
[1:26:13] there in Ephesians he made us he has
[1:26:15] made us to sit in Heavenly places in
[1:26:16] Christ Jesus amen so our position in
[1:26:20] Christ of being in Heavenly places is
[1:26:22] not a feeling oh I feel like I'm in
[1:26:25] Heavenly places and yes we are but it's
[1:26:27] talking about your position so when a
[1:26:30] son now when a when a son or daughter is
[1:26:33] adopted or placed in the
[1:26:35] family they are placed in a certain
[1:26:38] position by the authority of the father
[1:26:40] that's right he says what they say is as
[1:26:43] good as me saying it that's right what
[1:26:45] they do is as good as me doing it all
[1:26:47] the power I have I give them all the
[1:26:49] authority to use all the power I have
[1:26:52] and they become placed in their position
[1:26:54] position now once that person is in that
[1:26:57] position I do not believe they can
[1:27:00] become a slave or I mean a servant under
[1:27:03] tutors again they stay in that
[1:27:06] position amen they are plac in the
[1:27:08] family and they're and their name on the
[1:27:11] check is as good as the father's name
[1:27:14] amen and so if that is the case
[1:27:18] now being in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:27:21] Jesus is a position that God has placed
[1:27:23] us in
[1:27:24] it's not a feeling that's right so if
[1:27:27] you've been placed in that position
[1:27:29] you're in that
[1:27:30] position amen and so if God has made us
[1:27:33] joint ears with Christ in our walk with
[1:27:36] him we don't become joint ears and not
[1:27:38] joint ears we don't become the bride and
[1:27:40] they're not the bride and the bride they
[1:27:41] not the bride and the bride and not the
[1:27:43] bride but sometimes we're walking along
[1:27:45] and everything's going well we're the
[1:27:47] bride we're Rapture Ready you know but
[1:27:49] then they then then we get onto a gravel
[1:27:51] patch on the road and things begin to go
[1:27:53] sideways and we think Lord are we ever
[1:27:54] going to get
[1:27:56] there amen remember it's a maturing in
[1:27:58] the walk absolutely but when the spirit
[1:28:01] of God falls into your life and it's not
[1:28:03] just a confession but you see his word
[1:28:05] become manifested in you in every way
[1:28:09] what's happened now you become Rapture
[1:28:11] Ready but now he's maturing you that's
[1:28:13] right as long as life is in there and
[1:28:15] remember the life in you will never will
[1:28:17] never come go against the word of God
[1:28:19] that's right that's right and so Satan
[1:28:21] now he came in religion in in Ezekiel
[1:28:24] he's the God of this world so he wants
[1:28:26] to be
[1:28:27] worshiped but there has come to a place
[1:28:30] now where where where he once was
[1:28:34] standing in heaven and he could go
[1:28:36] before the father's throne and be an
[1:28:39] accuser just like in the days of job he
[1:28:42] went up there before the Throne of God
[1:28:44] you know Job chapter 1 and so he was the
[1:28:47] accuser because he stands there and he
[1:28:49] accuses he he he tells everything you
[1:28:52] have done and he accuses you to God
[1:28:55] because God knows God uh Satan knows
[1:28:58] that God is a god of his word and we're
[1:29:01] Sinners God has to come to a place where
[1:29:02] he just wipes it off he knows it that's
[1:29:04] why he always tried to get Israel to
[1:29:06] fall because knew if Israel fell then
[1:29:08] God would have to take them out of the
[1:29:09] land that's right and so he's there
[1:29:11] accusing day and night you I'm going to
[1:29:14] be done soon okay but there has to come
[1:29:17] a time when the accuser of our Brethren
[1:29:19] is cast down where he has no access
[1:29:22] anymore to to accuse the Sons and
[1:29:26] Daughters of God and and and and you
[1:29:29] know and and tell it to God Amen now
[1:29:31] there's a scene which is very
[1:29:32] interesting where when we go to
[1:29:34] Revelations chapter 5 and chapter 4 we
[1:29:38] are taken into John is taken up into the
[1:29:41] throne room up into heaven and he begins
[1:29:44] to describe everything that's there he
[1:29:46] sees the throne he sees the cheram
[1:29:48] around the throne he sees the 4 and20
[1:29:50] Elders he sees the host of Heaven there
[1:29:53] but there's one one person that is not
[1:29:55] there amen there is one person that is
[1:29:57] not allowed to be there anymore there is
[1:29:59] no devil there that's right there's
[1:30:01] Satan is not there and it's because at
[1:30:04] the time of the taking of the book amen
[1:30:07] at the time of the taking of the book
[1:30:09] now Satan is cast down the accuser of
[1:30:12] the Brethren is cast down amen you say
[1:30:15] what does that mean the taking of the
[1:30:16] book it's where everything that Adam
[1:30:18] lost couldn't go into the hands of Satan
[1:30:21] the title deed to the Earth it couldn't
[1:30:23] go into a slippery hand so it went back
[1:30:24] to the original Creator and it waited
[1:30:27] there for a man to come to lay claims on
[1:30:30] the book and to restore everything back
[1:30:32] amen and when John was lifted up he
[1:30:34] looked around he saw no man was you know
[1:30:36] there was a call a strong Angel Mighty
[1:30:39] Angel stood there and said who's worthy
[1:30:40] to take the book loose the seals thereof
[1:30:43] and John's looking cuz he knows he's not
[1:30:44] worthy that's right amen he saw the
[1:30:47] Angels the Angels were sinless they
[1:30:48] would have been worthy but they weren't
[1:30:50] man that's right they're different
[1:30:52] they're just servants a son has to come
[1:30:54] oh Hallelujah a Kinsman has to come Amen
[1:30:57] to redeem the family back from being
[1:30:59] slaves to back to their position so he
[1:31:02] looked around he couldn't see he begins
[1:31:03] to weep because he knows a Kinsman must
[1:31:06] come it's a law in the word a Kinsman
[1:31:08] has to come and restore and he can't see
[1:31:10] the Kinsman anywhere it begins to weep
[1:31:12] but then he says weep not and you an
[1:31:14] elder comes don't weep John the lion of
[1:31:17] the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[1:31:20] Hallelujah and he looks he he's
[1:31:21] advancing from the eternities in he
[1:31:24] looks he sees a lamb coming Hallelujah
[1:31:27] he saw the Lord Jesus you advancing out
[1:31:29] wounded bleeding amen he has prevailed
[1:31:32] and overcome hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:31:34] he's been standing there as a
[1:31:36] intercessor but now he's but he's always
[1:31:38] an intercessor remember because he's
[1:31:40] still our intercessor but he's left he's
[1:31:43] left that kind of role in that way but
[1:31:44] he still is an intercessor but now he
[1:31:46] comes wait maybe I should um explain
[1:31:50] that when John looked at him he saw a
[1:31:52] lamb but he was the lion but to John
[1:31:56] he's his lamb he's a sacrifice and he's
[1:31:58] not just a dead sacrifice but he is also
[1:32:01] the priest he's also our intermediary
[1:32:03] which is a priest's work he's our
[1:32:04] intercessor so because he's liive
[1:32:06] forever more he is the sacrifice but he
[1:32:09] is our intercessor he is our
[1:32:12] priest he was made as a high priest
[1:32:14] after the order of
[1:32:15] bzdc so he but he was in an intercessory
[1:32:19] role but now he's come to change his
[1:32:21] role but he still is an intercessor amen
[1:32:25] I'll put it this way it's like well I
[1:32:28] just always use Christian as an example
[1:32:30] when she was born in her was to be a
[1:32:32] sister but she had no siblings but in is
[1:32:35] to be a sister in is to be a mother but
[1:32:37] she can't be a mother she's a little
[1:32:38] girl in to be an auntie but she has no
[1:32:42] nieces or nephews to be an auntie but
[1:32:44] then as time goes on those attributes
[1:32:47] are being able to be expressed amen
[1:32:49] because now Sharon was born now she can
[1:32:51] be a sister yeah that's right amen and
[1:32:53] then then we get married now in her was
[1:32:55] to be a wife but she couldn't be a wife
[1:32:57] as a little girl there's no husband now
[1:32:59] we get married now she's a wife she's
[1:33:00] still a sister she's still a daughter
[1:33:02] but now another part of her life is
[1:33:04] manifesting amen amen and now we have
[1:33:07] children now she's a mother in her was
[1:33:09] to be a mother but she couldn't be a
[1:33:11] mother there has to come to a process of
[1:33:13] time now she's a mother just like our
[1:33:15] lord Jesus in him was to be a sacrifice
[1:33:17] to be a lamb to be our you know you know
[1:33:19] to be our healer Our Redeemer Our God
[1:33:22] everything but certain times when he can
[1:33:25] manifest those things remember je
[1:33:28] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:33:30] the new so in him was to be a person
[1:33:33] that would in him was to be a lamb but
[1:33:37] he wasn't a lamb in the Old Testament he
[1:33:40] gave animal lamb but he was the lamb but
[1:33:44] in him was to be a God's provided
[1:33:46] sacrifice but then he came now and his
[1:33:49] name was changed from Jehovah to Jesus
[1:33:53] when the angel you shall call his name
[1:33:55] Jesus is saying Jesus means Jehovah
[1:33:57] savior Jehovah's salvation so now God
[1:34:00] made flesh is going to manifest God's
[1:34:02] salvation to the Earth amen because he's
[1:34:05] changing what he's
[1:34:07] doing amen so in him now so he comes out
[1:34:13] when John turns to look he doesn't see a
[1:34:15] lion he sees a lamb amen but it's all
[1:34:18] about what relationship he is to you
[1:34:21] because a a Lon he means a judge a king
[1:34:23] he's going to rule the world with a rod
[1:34:25] of iron but the bride when the bride
[1:34:27] sees him amen she sees a lamb Hallelujah
[1:34:30] she sees God's provided sacrifice she
[1:34:32] sees the high priest she sees her
[1:34:34] intercessor sees the intermediary she
[1:34:37] sees Mercy amen hallelujah so now but in
[1:34:41] the scene Satan's not there and he comes
[1:34:43] and he takes the book because now he he
[1:34:47] purchased our Salvation on Calvary but
[1:34:49] now he's going to enforce what he paid
[1:34:51] for that's right and what he paid for
[1:34:53] was Adam's fall and race coming back to
[1:34:55] their position and he releases The
[1:34:57] Inheritance because only he's worthy to
[1:34:59] take it and it's amazing because in one
[1:35:02] instance remember John is the type of
[1:35:04] the Bride one man he is a symbol in the
[1:35:07] book too that's right he's a symbol in
[1:35:09] the book yeah that's right so John John
[1:35:12] is a symbol of you remember the Book of
[1:35:16] Revelation is the bride's book true
[1:35:18] these things aren't mysterious anymore
[1:35:20] they be made plain and so now John in
[1:35:23] one instance he wasn't allowed to even
[1:35:25] look at the book you read Revelations 4
[1:35:27] and 5 but then in Revelations 10 after
[1:35:29] the book is open and it comes down he's
[1:35:31] been called to become one with the book
[1:35:34] to eat the book and then speak out its
[1:35:36] contents amen hallelujah well what is
[1:35:38] that contents the contents of the book
[1:35:40] is everything Adam lost has been
[1:35:42] restored so that means your dominion
[1:35:45] over the Earth amen over nature amen and
[1:35:49] because Jesus has dominion over hell
[1:35:51] death in the grave and all the works of
[1:35:52] Satan that's included in it too amen
[1:35:55] amen because if I if I have true just
[1:35:58] like you have a everyone who owns
[1:36:00] property if there's a squatter in the
[1:36:02] place you don't have full Dominion but
[1:36:05] but the Le your legal right is you have
[1:36:07] a legal right to kick that squatter off
[1:36:09] because it's your ground amen that means
[1:36:12] you have true Dominion so anything that
[1:36:14] tries to come into the ground you have
[1:36:16] the legal right to to call the police or
[1:36:18] kick them out yourself however you want
[1:36:20] to do it but that person must leave
[1:36:22] that's right amen amen so by us being
[1:36:25] restored back to what Adam was we have
[1:36:27] the same legal right now to have
[1:36:30] dominion over Satan when he tries to
[1:36:32] work the Earth amen
[1:36:35] hallelujah amen is this all right you
[1:36:38] you have to see we have dominion Satan
[1:36:40] is under our feet
[1:36:42] am
[1:36:44] amen so at the taking of the book Satan
[1:36:46] is cast down the accuser of the Brethren
[1:36:48] is cast down because now everything that
[1:36:51] Satan could accuse the believer of has
[1:36:53] been stricking has been been strucken
[1:36:56] off thank you Lord amen amen and we
[1:37:00] happen to be living in that day and
[1:37:02] now
[1:37:05] Hallelujah
[1:37:08] now this is
[1:37:10] Dominion you say well I don't you say
[1:37:14] well I don't have that kind of authority
[1:37:16] yes you do yes amen amen the scripture
[1:37:20] tells us in Corinthians it says we
[1:37:22] believe therefore we speak
[1:37:24] amen it says in Romans 10 that faith
[1:37:28] speaketh on this wise the word is
[1:37:30] neither even in thy heart and how do you
[1:37:33] cast down Satan you have to speak the
[1:37:35] word amen be inspired and speak the word
[1:37:38] and then Satan has to obey your voice
[1:37:41] amen he had to obey Jesus's voice he had
[1:37:44] to obey you know and if the bride and
[1:37:46] the groom do the same thing then the
[1:37:48] spirit of God in the bride means the
[1:37:51] bride has the authority to cast Satan
[1:37:53] out
[1:37:54] cast him down to put him in his place
[1:37:56] amen amen but every believer has that
[1:37:59] Authority it's not just a five-fold
[1:38:01] Ministry or the Elders of the church
[1:38:03] amen a sinner that's just coming and
[1:38:05] being redeemed has the same Authority
[1:38:07] amen hallelujah has the same power amen
[1:38:10] that's why we can stand in our homes and
[1:38:12] cast Satan out we change the atmosphere
[1:38:14] wherever we are Hall the enemy tries to
[1:38:17] creep and we can kick them out
[1:38:19] Hallelujah we have that Authority it's
[1:38:22] time to exercise our right yes right
[1:38:24] hallelujah it's a god-given
[1:38:27] right amen we have more power than Satan
[1:38:31] himself amen Satan's been stripped of
[1:38:33] all power he's just a bluff amen it's
[1:38:36] time to call Satan's hand in every
[1:38:38] situation amen
[1:38:40] hallelujah because you'll come to find
[1:38:43] out he really is a bluff amen that's
[1:38:47] right amen he really is a bluff in every
[1:38:50] situation Hallelujah but it's up to us
[1:38:52] now are we going use our god-given
[1:38:54] Authority or we just going to shrink
[1:38:56] back and let him and let the devil have
[1:38:57] his day amen amen no I say no let's be
[1:39:01] militant that's right amen against Satan
[1:39:04] that's right Hallelujah cuz we have the
[1:39:05] authority and if the Bride As I said a
[1:39:08] while ago if the groom had Dominion the
[1:39:10] bride has the same
[1:39:12] Dominion amen we have the right we have
[1:39:16] the power in the name of Jesus amen
[1:39:19] amen amen I'll just leave it there but
[1:39:23] you got to remember servants are not the
[1:39:25] same as Sons and Daughters Angels were
[1:39:28] made to be servants the devil and his
[1:39:30] angels are servants they're under you
[1:39:32] yes amen so if he is trying to deril
[1:39:37] your life and trying to take Dominion
[1:39:38] he's out of his place and this is the
[1:39:41] day and hour where everyone comes into
[1:39:44] their position amen the bride comes into
[1:39:46] her position Satan is cast down into his
[1:39:50] position that's right amen this is the
[1:39:52] hour it has to happen amen hallelujah
[1:39:55] there in Revelations 9 it says I saw a
[1:39:57] star fall from Heaven amen which was
[1:40:00] Lucifer he had the key to the bonless
[1:40:02] pit but he fell that's right Hallelujah
[1:40:04] the devil is falling in this hour but

[1:40:09] ascending amen we have some musicians to
