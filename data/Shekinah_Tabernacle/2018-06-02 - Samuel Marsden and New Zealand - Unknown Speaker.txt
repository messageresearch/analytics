may they do speak they continue to speak the words of life and we just pray it blesses service here this morning in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord god bless you all you can take your seats this morning okay so you all kind of know me by now my um my messages are slightly different I just do what I do and I like to look into things in study on things I get a little subject and I just like to look around at it and it takes me about a week I just by the time I finished preparing it I think I'm done you know I've gotten all I want out of it and delivering it as a wee bit different because most of my inspiration comes when I just dig out but this is a different one and I've had this on my heart to do for quite a while I thought if I do we know when they win brother beam pulls out the spare tire you know do this one here and I've wanted to do a study on it started off being a study just on the message in New Zealand in a bit of a historical context and then I kind of thought well I can't really do that unless I go back and maybe a few hundred years and get get the look at when Christianity came to this country and then take it all the way through so I was going to have it all the way through from about 1720 to about 2018 but I realized you couldn't quite do it in one hour and I barely got through I was having trouble getting that the the man that first brought the gospel here I was having trouble even getting him to the shores of New Zealand I was at sixty slides until he hadn't even got here so I thought there's no way that I'm going to go into you know that what the Lord did in this country in the you know in those times and through the merry people in there and the revivals that came here and then the message that the brother that brought the message here and how that sort of spread through the country Shannon said to me don't say this but I'm going to say it anyway I my next one if when you know I do about two a year maybe it may be I may do this in a three-part series so the next one may be today I'm just going to do it to the gospel coming here and then the next one may be the gospel Hallett works for about a hundred years and then the next one may be the message how the message came around because there's many great Testim but the purpose of it is is to realize that we're not just here coincidentally and in our life is significant it's not we are part of a greater plan than just what we think we are we're actually part of a great plan of God and sometimes when you step back and look at what God's done you it gives us a bit more it's given me a bit more encouragement to actually realize you know what I'm a part of a bigger plan I'm fighting for the kingdom of God that's actually doing a work and and I don't want to get sidetracked on other things but I want to actually see the master and say Lord what so what's the job for me today what's our plan what are we doing and realizing we we there was a plan for us so I'm driving three things this morning can you turn that okay so let's slide on now the scripture I'm going to read there's revelations 3:8 it's just part of the salasi you can just some read it from here and it's I know though it works behold I've set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and it's not denied my name and the reason why I read that is because the time period that we're going to go into as as what brother Branham called the open door age you know we're where the Lord opened up a door for missionaries and for the gospel to go out throughout the world and in this little study you kind of see the dynamics of how that came about and why that could happen in kind of why it's not happening now but so this was the thrust of the gospel at that time was actually was the open door age where the gospel could go out and we're going to be studying a man called samuel marsden who's heard of samuel marsden hey we've got some out-of-towners out of countries that have heard of samuel marsden there's a college in wellington here called um Marsden college I think it's called Marsden girls college yep that's named after Samuel Marsden I think there's a his Marsden point where they do the picture of the oil refinery so we're gonna be studying a man called Seema Muslim because he he essentially was though the one that that the Lord used to bring the gospel into this country for now this is by no means a political sermon my kingdom is the kingdom of God I appreciate politicians more the more and more I appreciate them but this is not political at all because without perfect love you can't have peace or anything and our kingdom the kingdom of God is perfect love and you can't get that here now I appreciate men that try their best to make things as best as they can but you can't get that here ultimately so at a certain point I just leave it all alone and say Lord I can't wait for the new kingdom we're perfect love reigns that's what we're after now I've got a few to get through so I'm going to try and rush through this this man is Samuel must and I'm gonna go through the history of him can you all see that okay at the back okay good now he was born 28 to July 1764 and near Leeds and England have you been to Leeds you guys looked at Lilian you been there nice place this is it here yeah got a few little pictures of it if he was alive he would be 254 years old so it's not really that long ago when you think about it it's not that long ago its appearance we're just he was just an average guy's parents were appearance was a father was a farmer and I think he did a bit of butchery he was he wasn't really anything of note essentially but he loved the Lord and that showed and his and his zeal as he was growing up he just had a desire for the things of the Lord school was just went to school and learnt like everyone else did but he always had a desire to want to work in there not so much the mission but just work for the kingdom of God to be a minister or something like that he just had this desire and I'm going to talk about the eland Society I'll bring this the the Society and there were a few societies like this that were formed at the time and these societies were formed by politically powerful and wealthy men in England who had a desire that the gospel would be spread throughout the world and the the one of the societies was called the eland society and a few of the men that that were part of the formation of this of the society was this man here Henry Thornton maybe you don't know Henry Thornton but they actually call him the father of modern banking and he the world knows him if you're in the if you're in the economic circles you would know this man here so they know him in a and an economic sense and indeed economically in in London the owned he was part of a group of three of them that they had one of the biggest banks in London and they spread out throughout the UK so he was very wealthy but he was also a devout Christian man that had a desire to see the gospel spread throughout the world and he actually was part of societies the CMS he was part of forming that he was part of the formation of the Bible Society these men formed a lot of organizations to actually whatever way they could to spread the gospel he wasn't so much a minister or anything but he just wanted to put his money and effort into the gospel another men was this man you may have heard of this men William Wilberforce he was the he was at a politician these two I think were they were cousins and he he was the man that his whole one of his missions that he felt was to abolish slavery throughout the British Empire so that was it was what he fought for amongst other things he was part of these PCN lots of different organizations that would push good causes and he achieved that the abolishment of slavery as well another man that was part of the group and part of their friends was John Newton and he was the man that wrote Amazing Grace so there was all these there was all these men there was Joseph Milner he that he wrote though he was very well known for writing a commentary on the Old Testament he didn't put a lot of work into that now these were very powerful men politically powerful men essentially some of the wealthiest most powerful men in the world but they had a desire to spread the gospel and say you start understanding why this could be an open door edge because in this day and age when when we want to go and seen brother Andy to Vietnam essentially he's got to try and hook into his own back pocket or you know we try and give a little bit here a little bit there to help him out for argument's sake mission work back in that time there was a essentially almost a country and the political powers backing mission work so there was there was money and effort and time and groups and everything pushing it to actually see that it could happen and part of this group the eland society their their goal was to get people that were keen to that they felt they had a call on of the Lord upon their life and and essentially pay for them to go through college power their expenses and then and then send them out throughout the world as missionaries and pay all their expenses so this group they had a expressed purpose of sending the gospel out and they came across samuel marsden and they realized that this is a sort of person we want to be supporting so they they support it and they took him out of his school and they he went to this Saint John's College to those times you'd sort of study I think he was part of the Church of England but they would train him up and what's the purpose of sending these men out to to spread the gospel all around the world I need to bring in a bit of background history here London and 1780 this was kind of the Industrial Revolution was happening and so a lot of the people from the the countryside and that the country were moving into the bigger cities and they were setting up factories and things like that there was a lot of child labor going on and all these sorts of things a lot of the politicians that we just looked at were part of trying to get rid of that those sort of systems and those practices but as a result of all the influx of people into the cities there because factories would come and go and things would change the a lot of people ended up there with no work and they became a lot of social unrest and there was a lot of I guess pity crime in crime and then they apparently gin they learned how to make Jen so they sort of spread through the cities so half the town almost all the common people would just became drunks and it was a it was a chaotic place apparently and another thing that happened was there was a death penalty for so many things in that time there was a death penalty for if you stole a rabbit out of a rabbit hole you could be put to death for it and and they were just people were being put to death for mainly for crimes of theft there's a lot of and see the politicians we're realizing that this is a bit too extreme to put people to death for these things but then the concept of a jail like a prison they thought no that's American that's kind of like how the Americans do it we don't want that so their idea was just to seem people to other countries was the at this solution so they were actually sending people to America they sent about fifty thousand convicts to America until there was the War of Independence and in course after that the Americans didn't want any more convicts sent over so that that little party was stopped and so Captain Cook came and he did his venture around the South Pacific and he told them of a place called they called it New Holland but we know it as Australia and then they came up with this idea well that's it probably a nice place we can looks like a pretty barren land we'll just maybe we'll ship with our convicts out to there because they didn't want to start like kill him all but they didn't want to have them in prisons in the UK they didn't like the idea so they that's what they did so at that time over the course of 20 or 30 years sorry over the course of about 80 years they shipped 100 and around about a hundred and sixty two thousand convicts some just petty criminals some bad guys to Australia year after year after year they sent convicts they're the first ones the first boat arrived in 1788 and on the 20th of January but they came to one band they saw it wasn't gonna suit what they were doing so they went out to another Bay and Port Jackson this was this is in Sydney Parramatta and they went ashore on the 26th of January and and started the new convict colony essentially and the Australian celebrate Australia Day well that's the date where the convicts first turned up so that's what they celebrate their 20 percent of Australians descendants of convicts so this is a very significant portion of the population the when they decided a plan to seen the convicts there they still wanted to have some sort of Christian influence off on the country so the the man they appointed to be the chaplain of the colony and to try and keep some sort of Christian order to it was a man Richard Johnson and he held the first sort of Christian service in terms of a at British well I guess it was because the Aborigines weren't serving the the Lord as we know so that was that they they turned up on the 26th and in the first Sunday was the febri the third and they had the first Christian service that day and that was run by Richard Johnson and I've just got a little um black there too it commemorates it and people like John Newton were they were influential and getting this man over there and William Wilberforce than those people so now we we that was that was the time when samuel marsden was going through college and starting to decide they were they were they didn't know where they were going to send him but he was going through his training and over time they thought that we need another chaplain in Australia to help this other man because one there is just not enough so they approached him when he was 29 and said would you like the job of being the second chaplain and Parramatta in Sydney in Australia he refused at first because he said I'm only 29 I can't do this I'm too young you know but they they must have seen something in him and they they pressured him to say no we think you should be the one that goes there so in the end he took up their invitation to go and become a chaplain the second second-in-command chaplain in Australia so now that he was coming from a very political he wasn't just a nobody being sent here tune up and say guys I'm here I'm so and so can I do something here he was going in through official channels as a minister of the gospel to to push Christianity officially it wasn't an unofficial like like brother and he's going to Vietnam unofficially know that that we do mission work now unofficially almost but this was official business so he was living near Leeds and then he when he decided to take it up he um sorry I should have I've got to going so I'll try and keep this one going as well as Marlon he went to Hull and he had to wait me for about eight months because he was going to be going to Australia on a convict ship because they were the only ships that were going there so he had to wait for the convict ship to tune up well he was there he married his lifelong wife Elizabeth Tristan that this was April 1793 so he married here well he was there and then in August the convict ship turned up to Hull and they had to go down to a little place called Portsmouth and stop and there maybe pick up more convicts there and they're never going to head to Australia from there apparently he was preaching a service because it was a Sunday he was part way through preaching his service and you heard the guns or the Bell whatever the ship does that the ships leaving and so he's he's part way through service and he sees the ships leaving over gotta go and hop on the ship so he runs down to the ship and history tells us that all the congregation sort of followed him down and followed him out to the shore and then he went off to the ship I think that they see that in the book I read because they had a he gained a lot of respect where he went because he had it as I think they realized his motive was pure and as intentions were pure can you forward that please thank you this place here is called the Isle of Man who's heard of the Isle of men okay ports mouths as as just as in England and the Isle of Man is a small little island I want they always want to talk about this for a second there was a lady there called Elizabeth Walbridge she she was just like a any other I guess normal teenager growing up and the UK and we go heads Christian values but over time a new teenage year see she didn't want it she rebelled against it she said she didn't do anything bad she just was prideful I didn't think that she needed God or anything like that so I don't want to go to church I'm I'm fine so she was nothing there was no real significant testimony about her but she went to a service on one Sunday and she was so convicted by what you heard that she just she thought now I've got to serve the Lord I've got to commit my life over to the Lord from going to the service so then she began to serve the Lord over the course of time her sister passed away and she asked a man to come and officiate at the minister to come and officiate the funeral of his sister and this man Lee Richmond sorry Lee Richmond when he began talking with you he was taken back by how much he loved the Lord and and he started to find out about her life now she had began to get sick herself as well and for the last I think year or two of her life she was confined to her a chair she what she did was sit down and she could all she did was read the Bible all day so he was taken back by how much he knew about the scriptures because all she did all day every day was read the Bible and and even though she was and it had a terminal sickness here well she naturally should have been going negative she was so positive in here outlook and his service to the Lord was so positive that he was just taken back by how she would act and so he would he found out about her life and interviewed her and did a few different things and then she passed away and he wrote a book about her essentially just a little story of her life only a short book and nothing overly dramatic and out in terms of a testimony but there was something about the book that just caught on and inspired people and this book in 1828 by 1828 there were four million copies of this book in 19 languages and it was estimated that they were and during the 1802 sort of 1900 there are over ten million copies of this book that were printed and seen all around the world all different languages and there were thousands and thousands came to the Lord through the reading of this book of this Elizabeth Walbridge and no one really knows why they thought it's just an average story but in yet that had such a profound effect and it like people like the Queen of England she had read the book so she actually did a pilgrimage to the to the gravestone to see the grave of Elizabeth Walbridge now the reason why I told you that story was because when samuel marsden was in portsmouth as he does when he turns up to an area he efforts a sunday he thinks log on find a church to go and preaching because that's what I do I'm a minister so he went across to the Isle of Man and preached a sermon in this little church and it was Elizabeth Ward she was at she came to that sermon and it was assuming that he preached that that it that caused her conversion so when she says I went to a church and a minister preached and I was convicted that was samuel marsden preached that sermon and he assumed was called be clothed with humility I want to read you these here politically at the time there was a war with England and France so they had to if they were going to sail throughout the out of the kind of English area they had to wait for a convoy of ships to go together because they and and for the Navy to be with him because the ships were still being attacked so if they had a convoy of ten or fifteen ships it was going to be safer so they waited and ports mouths till all the ships were there and then they began the ESTs sailed on the comics ship to Australia I want to read this so you this is Samuel Marsden's diary so these are he has words so you start to get an idea of what he's like I'll just read you a few of these you probably can't see that 30th of September this morning the signal was given by the commander for all the ships under his convoy to weigh anchor and prepare for sea about nine o'clock the whole fleet was all under say which consisted of about 40 ships the one was really fear so we were quickly in the main ocean I was soon affected by the motion of the vessel I thought of brother Marty when I read this that's why I put it in here I was soon affected by the motion of the vessel this rendered me quite unfit for any religious duties so he sees basically I got seasick oh how miserable must be this state must this state be who have all their religion to seek when sickness and death come upon them Lord grant that this meant even be my case so he's saying well imagine if you get to a state of this disparate state or sickness or illness and you don't know the Lord I'd rather tune up in that state knowing the Lord because he was thinking now I'm so sick now so now he's on the ship and he and here's his words on a Sunday he says how different is a Sabbath from those that I formerly known when I could meet with the great congregation I longed for these means and privileges again oh when shall I come and appear before God yet it is a consolation to me but to believe that I am in the way of my duty I requested the captain today to give me permission to perform divine service to the ship's company let me have a church service to all of convicts he rather hesitated said he had never seen a religious sailor but at length promised to have service the following Sunday so he's on the ship and he's already saying to the captain let me run a it's a Sunday let me run a service captain said no I've never seen a religious sailor we've seen one haven't we brother Chris okay now the next Sunday comes around he says that this is his words the last Sabbath that kept them promised me I should have Liberty to perform divine service today but to my great mortification he now declines how unwilling are the unconverted to see anything of divine truth the next Sunday I rose this morning with a great desire to preach to the ship's company you did not know how I should be able to accomplish my wish we were now four ships and company so the other ships had left and gone different ways our captain had invited the captains belonging to the other three to dine with us today as soon as they came on board I mentioned my design to one of them to want to have a service who immediately comply with my wish and said he would mention it to our captain what she did and preparations were made for me to preach I read part of the church prayers and afterwards preached from the third chapter of st. John the fourteenth and fifteen verses as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness etcetera the sailors stood on the main deck I and four captains upon the quarterdeck and they were a tentative and the good effects were apparent during the remainder of the day so he began having services every week on the ship after that now the journey from England to Australia on a sailing ship takes a long time about four or five months and they go from England down to Rio de Janeiro they stop there for supplies and things and then they go to Cape Town stop there and then around to Australia so it's it's a very long way and in December they arrive in Australia so it's past it but yes so that's right and this here just says he was happy to see the land now the first Sunday that he was there I want to read his diary what he said saw several persons at work as I went along so this is Sunday I saw several persons at work as I went along to whom I spake and warn them of the evil of Sabbath breaking you shouldn't be working on Sunday my mom was deeply affected with the wickedness I beheld going on as first service I spoke from the 6th chapter of Revelation behold the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand as I was returning home a young man followed me into the wood and told me how he was to stress for the salvation of a soul he seemed to manifest the strongest marks of contrition and to be truly awakened to a sense of this of his danger I hope the Lord will have many souls in this place when you read how he talks you start to see there's attitude was his heart was pure a lot of a secular world right the sky off and don't like him but I think differently of him now you know we see there was a senior chaplain he was the essentially the vice chaplain it was within six months maximum of a year I think that this man said he had to go back to the UK and then he was going to come back but he never had any intention of returning because I think the the the state of the area that he was trying to minister and became too much for him because all he was dealing with were criminals and trying to I don't know how much of contact the help with the aborigine people but the whole society was basically that from a British sense all the dregs of Britain was sent there and these guys had to try and run that I want to read this here the state of morals was utterly depraved as in don't know this word and were dishes lying with general marriage and the sacred secretaries of domestic life are almost unknown and those who from the station should have set an example to the comics and settlers encouraged sin and others by essentially doing it themselves so this man got so discouraged and one of Samuel Marsden's pieces of advice that he would always give to the mission group back in England cuz I would ask him Oh after you've been here for years and years they used to ask him advice of what they should do and one of the things he said was don't see anyone that's melancholy over to the mission field don't seem down as he said this is this place is hard it's rough it's tough if you're a downer you're gonna fail because you've got to be a go-getter you've got to be willing to get your hands dirty and all sorts of things and he said of this guy he was a bit of a melancholy downer so it all got too many years went home so that left samuel marsden essentially 30 years old in charge of the the christian welfare of this whole convict colony which that was never really his plan i think going into it now we need to end up the governor of the year because he was working for the government and him working for the crown the new rule was that because they were short-staffed i guess that the the chaplains had to also be magistrates so now he turns up and has caught this colony he wants to spread the gospel and share the Word of God and suddenly he gets tired now you also have to be a judge in anything that goes wrong they can be thrown before you and you've got a dish out some sort of whatever punishment is applicable to these guys that have put before you and that included here to dish out anything from floggings to even and that day they had the death penalty still even hangings and things like that and of course he refuses he said I didn't come here to I'm a minister I don't work in this field I'm a minister but his ties were such that he had to he essentially was a he worked for them missiles as boss and he just had to do the job he had to do and I think in those times you didn't really question the authority he just did what you had to do but he didn't like it and one man quoted that you know if you do both officers their detriment to each other you're basically ruin both you know you try be a minister one hand he's trying to minister to people in the other hand he might throw the same guy will flog the same guy the next day he got a reputation for being just but what the Australians call him the flogging person and they don't like him because they said I used to dish out all these floggings to to us he didn't want to he didn't wasn't interested in that job but he had to I want to tell you this just to get an get you in the mindset of what he had to start dealing with when he went there this was one of the hangings he had to go to a man Joseph Samuel and a few other people a policeman had been killed well he was trying to find out who stole some lady's belongings he was murdered and they got three men thinking that these three men did it one of the men on the the day before his trial they thought no he didn't do it so they put him they didn't hang him but two other men they were going to hang and one of them was Joseph Samuel and Joe I'm Samuel Marsden's job was actually to go there and talk with this man and pray with this man before I was going to be hung and you know say I don't think he expected to have to do this sort of job when he was going to go to a mission field but this was just his job and and but before they were going to hang this man Joseph Samuel he he said a statement like look I didn't do it when I was in prison last night with this other guy he confessed to it the guy that you guys leaked I know yeah he said the guy you guys did go he confessed to me that he did it and the crowd said I was that true and there was a bit of an uproar but they so then they realized will the other guy that's about to get hung he obvious didn't do it because you didn't say it was some so they let him go so they were just gonna hang this guy Joseph Samuel why himself and they they I guess I had the cart they hit the rope and they pull the cart away and they hung him in the rope snapped and so then they get the guy off the ground the the hangman ties the rope again makes another noose try and hang them again and the Rope comes loose and then they tie another rope put it up there put him on the cart pull the cart away and the Rope snaps again this rope is tested for guys twice three times his size and well this is all happening the crowd is saying well hang on he must be innocent he's not we can't he's not dying so they actually it was a bit of an uproar and they got the governor in and they gave him a pardon on on the grounds of divine interference God nice and then wanted him to die so we're gonna leave him alive so but Josey he was if you look at that top ten guys that they couldn't kill you know execute he was I think number three and samuel marsden happened to be there during the whole event and prayed with the guy and everything but this was the sort of activity here to be involved with being in Australia another thing that happened was the governor said that all the people that work for the government the magistrates these different ones they could be allocated 100 acres of land and they will be allocated half a dozen convicts to work the land for them essentially for free so samuel marsden took them up on this offer because he tells that when he got there there was no food there it was a in his toy house there was a wee bit of meat leaf but there was no there was no farming there was nothing going on so they were essentially people they were starving they didn't have farms and commerce happening and so he got a hundred acres of land and he began to work this land and he was successful in what he did was farming and it was well then well then about this is actually his house here that's one of his houses now the Australians and many people again criticize him because he became very wealthy he he ended up he would do so well working his farm that he would buy the next guy's hundred acres and in this one and that one and that one he ended up with about three thousand acres of land he had he was the first to export wool into England he he had he had crops he had vineyards he had fruit he was a he became very commercial in his way of doing things and that got him a lot of criticism as well because they said well you're a minister what are you doing and business and just making money you you and they get this concept like he's just gone over to Australia and you know making taking advantage of the whole situation I want to read you something that and I'll just explain something I want to read you something that this was a French sailor that went through and Samuel Marsden and saw what he had done on his farm in it and he said listen eight years ago the whole of the spot was covered with the mints in useless forests what pains what exertions must have been employed these roads these pastures these fields his harvest these orchards these flocks the work of eight years and his admiration of the scene was not greater than his reference to its owner who he adds well he thus labored and his various important evocations was not unmindful of the interests of others he generously interfered on behalf of the poorest settlers in the district establish schools for their children and often relieved their necessities and then he sang and he was also nice to the the aborigine people of the land he was also helped them and a lot of ways to help them to get things now you see why you can see why over time why the Lord bless them they will see why later on but he actually had to write letters out to rebuff claims that he was just over there to make money so one of his letters he wrote back was he said he said this he said I did not consider myself in the same situation and a temporal point of view and this colony as a clergyman in England my situation if I was in England at that period would be a no such comparison a clergyman in England lives in the very bosom of his friends his comforts and his conveniences are all within his reach and he has nothing to do but to feed his flock on the contrary I entered the country which was in a state of nature and was obliged to plant and sew or starve that was not from my desire that my colleague and I took to the ax the Spade in a hoe we could not from our situation help ourself or any other means st. Paul's own hands ministered to us necessities necessities in a cultivated nation and our hands ministered to our wants and an cultivated one if this be cast upon me as a shame and reproach I cheerfully Barrett for the remembrance never gives me any cause of reproach or remorse so saying look say what you want I got the room we were starving and I had to we either did this or we died that was it and the Lord just bless what he didn't he became very wealthy now you hear all this and you start to think even in a bad situation life is going up looking out for him he's got quite a good position and things like that but any minister of the gospel any real servant of God I call it a I'm not the mark of a minister but the the hallmarks almost of a minister explained like this Paul Paul the great minister we would think you know Paul had and he would have had he was he was called of God he should have had an easy life but he didn't and when he wrote and one of the and one of the scriptures he explained how I've been shipwrecked I've been beaten I've been robbed I've been a Piero's on the CP rolls on the lamp here was among false brethren I've been whupped stoned I've had all these things and he says from henceforth let no man trouble me for our beer my body the marks of the Lord Jesus anyone that really serves the Lord and has got a bigger calling in the Lord you'll find that the relative in relation to their calling oftentimes they have hardship of the same magnitude but you look at what brother Brennan went through with the loss of his family and things that you know that he has to beer and anytime you look into a minister if you start to see these things in their life you think okay this is I can see the Lord here I don't know what how it works but that's just a minister of someone that really serves the Lord doesn't get an easy lot in life now samuel marsden when he was they went there and they were getting set up he had a little family because he was married in england and he came back in his his wife was sitting on a horse and buggy like this and holding their little child is parked holding their two three-year-old baby and then the horse kicked and the baby flung out of your arms and fell on the ground in so he lost one of his children there and the like these words here that this book was written in 1850 so it was still relevant they still could catch this he said he received tidings together with the body of his lifeless boy doesn't when they brought this dead boy to him and we are told with calm and even dignified submission so he just took the baby the boy and he said for he was a man who said little girl he felt much so you can imagine you've got to go through that that was one of the hardships he had to go through maybe a year or two later three years to three years later because of the death of their first that one of their children the mother always tried to protect the other children to anything happening from them she was going she had to go out summer and she lift the lift the child home and she got someone in a maiden or someone to you know stay here with the child and look after them while I go out maybe they used to just leave them alone but she said you stay here and look after this child but well she was out the little child was playing in the in their house and then those times they headed these they would cook in an open fire essentially like this and have a boiled stuff over the fire with the pot on it and this little baby was playing around stumbled and fell into the boiling pot of water and died from that so he lost another child so he didn't have it easy and you think that you know that the struggle he would have had and as Christian walk because he you know that's the first one was hard enough losing another child and he was a man like we were here they loved his children so the by no means had it easy he would preach a lot preached in different parishes there's a saying that said I just want to read this about his his preaching is described as very plain full of good sense and manly thought and treating chiefly of the teaching truthfully of the great foundational truths of the gospel so there was nothing really flashy about it he just spoke the Word of God and he said those who came to hear a great preacher went away disappointed but those but those who came to pass like an hour of you know no conviction where sometimes grievously disturbed because he would just sort of preach it how it was nothing flesh there was a story that after one of his services he was walking along by the river and a man looked like he he jumped into the river and so Samuel being Samuel he the first thought was I've got to go and save this man from drowning so he jumped in the river to save this this man from drowning when he got there to pull a man out the man started wrestling with him and trying to drown him so he fought with his man in the river and Samuel being the stronger of the to manage to fight with him overtake him and then he dragged him back to the shore and pulled him out when the man got to the shore he confessed what his intention was he said he was a convict you see Dolls in church this morning and you were preaching and you must have known the things that I was going through and that and you were you were basically preaching about me and you were making fun of me in the congregation you were singing me out making fun of me and so I will came here to I knew that if I went and jumped in the river you'd jump after me that I was going to drown you because that's what you you did that to me this man was converted here she became a big help to Samuel Marsden through throughout their work there so he had an effect as minute his preaching that may have been plain and very bland it hadn't effect on people and maybe that's the way little wanted it because of the people he was amongst were very just bland plain probably tough people you know he it was the other thing that he would do when he was there was he would not only preach in his main churches that he had but he would do two to three week essentially circuit write writing preaching as well the circuit writing preacher you would call it that so he would write for go out maybe 20 kilometers turn up and say I want to run a church service here and so that the people of that area would go out about 12 kilometer radius and gather about 60 people to come and have church and they would run a church service there and then he would ride for another 25 kilometers which was you know 12 within 12 cows out he would call them and they would have a church service see and he would ride around all the district sometimes for two or three weeks holding these church services and he became essentially a household name amongst and the area where he was and anytime that he would leave to go back to England for a period of time he would always hit there would always be a big congregation of people sending him off because he he garnered a lot of respect and the different with his ministry with his business things with us even as judged his Magistrate work he actually respected him a lot he had a good reputation I'll tell you the story because it's um this just kind of points out that sort of guy he was he he would have to write to from Port Jackson to Parramatta you know maybe fifteen kilometres often to go and preach and do different things and a few of his horses he had these they said no one else could handle his horses but when he would have them he'll be fine but what he would do is he would be in his little horse and buggy like this and he would get on the road and then I don't know what you do giddyup horsey let the reins go and just read the reader paper I read a book whatever for the 15 kilometres didn't drive his horses because he said any horse that just can't go beyond its own is not worth me having say-so he wasn't he didn't want to have to steer sources he just said you go let me know when we're home and that was there was just the way that he was something about him now we've got to cover these things because it starts to tie the story together of we're going to get to New Zealand who knows about whalers these men and this period of time were borderline on crazy the things that these men did whalers catching whales out in the middle of the ocean they went in their little boats and they would harpoon these things and these whales would tow them along and then they would have other boats and spear these massive whales and at the time when joseph samuel marsden was there that the whaling industry was becoming more and more popular and they would use the sperm whale oil forum user for cooking but also for I'm burning the lanterns and things and making wax because it was an odorless oil and it had a lot of uses for it so they would his men would kill these whales and get the oil out of it and different things and it was quite a big industry but hard rough work and the sort of people that did it were just hard rough type of people the Whalers more of these guys here this the the ventures that these men did but they were also just rough ungodly men that was just the character of these men probably nice men good but just rough now in 1791 I think it was a French Whaler they discovered he went around New Zealand and discovered that there were a lot of whales around New Zealand so he started he wailed around there for a bit did some whaling and then of course six months later once he's gone back to where he was going from he tells the people about New Zealand here there was a lot of whales around there and it was good whaling and so from that time what the ships will do the ships would come down and drop the convicts often and Sydney where similar wasn't in they would that would be their main port and then they would go across the Pacific in whale all around New Zealand catching whales and if they dream for months and months they for a time hit to go into Shore and and they would actually start going on shore and trading with the merry people in different parts of New Zealand to get water get supplies give them this for that and just do nothing major but just general trades of things like that so the Whalers started making contact with different parts of New Zealand I found these is a few little photos this is later on so this is at that time it was very small low-key but I found this one interesting because there was a potted or whaling station so they would come in here but this was more in the 1830s and 40s but now the they would have contact with the merry people and what would happen was the Mary's became interested in these guys and where are we where are you going and so over time that a lot of the merry people would hop on these whaling boats and sail around I've got a picture here I just want to touch on this this picture I've got here for a second this is this is Russell up and the bay of islands this became a popular area this may be it's the location of where it was the harbour it was just a it was sheltered it was just where a lot of the whaling was in the ships were coming in this was an 18 36 but I mean it's kind of fast forward a few 50 years just to tell you this part of the story whale is being whale as they would they were just ungodly people they would eventually Russell was just a pit of these guys came in with the alcohol with the prostitution with everything and they were just with with the merry people and it was all it was just a Charles Darwin of all people he went to Russell and he coined it and it still it's got this old still called this to the today if you research it it was called he called it the hellhole of the Pacific he said don't go to that decrepit place is just full of debauchery and drunkenness and fighting and so that was the influence of whalers head and it's you know that's the kingdom of Satan just getting in there you know what here was the kingdom of God trying to come into the place and at the same time the Satan's inning has missing there but we digress so now as a result of the merry people hopping on the ships in doing whaling and suddenly being one of the main ports that the Whalers would come back to and and pick up things and go back to England over time Sam you'll meet a lot of merry people on the ships that would come in and they would stay for a month or two three and he had a lot of contact with him and he actually he began to greatly he had a genuine respect for the way that they were and he wrote a letter to one man and he said I'm very anxious for the instruction of the New Zealanders which was a Mary's they are a noble race vastly superior and understanding to anything you could can imagine any cause of this but the savage nation could attain to so he's making contact with the Mary's and saying these guys are smart and clever and he picked he picked up very early that they were they displayed on to Commerce works and they would start doing deals and all sorts of things in and he but he had genuine respect for the for them s of people which I think was helped him and his motives towards him now he went back to England he has a desire now he wants to send missionaries to New Zealand so this is Samuels desire he wants to he's in Australia and he wants to send missionaries to New Zealand so he goes back to England and I think he was here for a few years trying to sort this out and he gets a few men one called Thomas Kindle another man called William Hall and a bunch of them he arranges all US and their intention is they're gonna go back to Australia and then Thomas hall and William Thomas Kindle and William hall are going to go to New Zealand and mission is over there I'm not gonna read this one now I want to tell you another story this man was called there were different spellings of his name but Roth IRA and this man was from the Bay of Islands he was a chief quite young but he was a chief from the Bay of Islands and he had a when the whaling ships would come through and go into the port he had a desire to do an OE so he hopped on a whaling ship called the Argo and just away they went and they they they worked all around for about five months getting whale oil and different things then after five months he was dropped off in Sydney and the the ship just dropped them off there and didn't Pam just lift him there and he this is often how the Mary people got treated on these ships not all the time but it was quite common you know they would abuse them and then just drop them off and don't pay them so this was one of them men they didn't pay and then he managed to find another whaling ship to bring him back to the Bay of Islands and the next ship was called the the L beyond and the captain of this was a good man and he took him they did the whaling venture and then when they got back to the Bay of Islands he paid him all of the money he was jus paid him everything and drop them off and they carried on about six months later there was another ship called the Santa Anna came through the battle and wrote our I wanted to do another venture so he hopped on the Santa Ana and the plan for that this ship was they were going to sail to the Norfolk Island and drop some men off there and they were going to hunt seals for a while well the Santa N and went back to New Zealand picked up supplies and then they were going to come back pick them up and they're never going to hit two actually England after that because this this man wanted to admit a lot of these Western the British people he wanted to go and see the chief I want to go to England see the chief that's what he said the king take me to see the chief so so now here they were dropped off on the Chatham Islands but they were there was about twelve or thirteen of these men they were given very few supplies before this time the Chatham Islands was actually set up as a convict colony for Australia but over time it they realized it wasn't going to work so they they abandoned it so they were still a old abandoned structures there from when it was a convict colony but for a period of about thirty years it was there's nobody there so they tune up on this island that I don't think they had water they had to get it from the Rana they didn't have running water Springs and things so these men were there they had very few supplies and the Santa Ana on the way back from New Zealand got caught in the storm and it was delayed by a few months so these these men had to live on this island for about three months and survival and basically seal in birds for three months and and he it was a rough time two of the Europeans died and one Ty Heaton man died just through starvation on this island the Santa Ana finally turned up there and and took these meant that picked him up and they went all the way back to the UK so this man finally was a little merry man from the Bay of Islands in as in the UK to go and see the chief but he wasn't allowed to see the chief they said no you can't go and see the king you know we don't work like that and he can't just walk in and see him and and they were quite mean to him near they just left him on the ship they wouldn't let him go into London and explore and then after a few weeks they said oh and you're gonna be getting on this other ship and going back to Sydney on this other ship and he asked him once again about my pay where's my pay I've been working for six months and this man refused to pay me just drop them off on the other ship no pay they will pay you and some muskets when you get to he said they left him on the ship now that ship he got onto it was the same ship that samuel marsden and his same convict ship that they were all going back to england on and well semia was on the ship he recognized this this Mary guy that was working the ship and he saw that his words where he was almost like he was look so sad and down and depressed and looked like he was almost going to die look like in a few days this man's going to die and so him being how many he a he liked the Mary people and be he was a compassionate man he went up to him I said why why do you look so how are you waiter what's wrong with you and so this man explained them all of his story what happened to him and he also said look the sailors would beat me all the time that's when he would coffee would cough up blood and things like that and he would have had bruisings and there he explained to them the mistreatment and Samuels own words I won't read that he actually he wanted to go and get the captain over the southern ship and he said if I could I would go and see him and say why have you treated this man like this but he was already he'd already left the shore so he couldn't he couldn't do that but he he assured this man he said I want to look after you he he told the captain we're not gonna have this man working we're gonna he can stop working we're gonna he's got to be looked after so they they looked after him for a you know the duration of the trip and he became very healthy and then they they got back to Australia and he stayed there for about eight months with Samuel Marsden he taught him the English he learnt different trades and they became quite good friends and he was very healthy after that and so after about eight months they were going to send him back to New Zealand so he hopped on a ship to go back to New Zealand and the ship that he went on to go back to New Zealand didn't drop him off in New Zealand they wailed around they drove a few kilometres past his the Bay of Islands and then they carried on to Norfolk Island and they dropped him off at North Oak Island just lift him there and carried on and he almost died again at Norfolk Island a whaling ship came in and picked them up from Norfolk Island when they saw him there and they took him back to Sydney again so he's still not back in his New Zealand and so CNE went back to suddenly found CMOS and again he helped him out again to get well then he hopped on another ship and this time he made it back to New Zealand so that was Samuels connection with this man he played a significant role in and bringing the gospel to New Zealand so they got him back to New Zealand now the plan was for these men to leave Australia and Garbi missionaries in New Zealand at the time they were different there was mission work going on around the Pacific and that the the two that Samuel wasn't three that Samuel was involved in was Australia trying to get people to New Zealand and Tahiti of all places so Tahiti is in the middle of nowhere and missionaries families were going over and just living on tahi and trying to spread the gospel there that wasn't successful at the start and a few of the men actually came back and were quite down and they stable semua for about eight months and he sent them back again to carry on the mission I want to tell you something that happened about that same time which changed the nature of the plan what they wanted to do is anyone who have the burning of the Boyd this is a this was a ship a trading whaling ship that turned up in the Bay of Islands and now that you know the story of sometimes how that the merry people were treated on ships there was a son of a chief that had gone whaling on this ship and done things and they mistreated him a lot on the ship and he had convinced him because he was angry this men for the way had been treated so he convinced him that this is the best way to pull into this Bay over here and his plan was when they pull him the bay he said we'll go and we'll get supplies in it but it was his own it was his people he was going to go there and tell them what had happened and they were going to come in and get you to revenge on these people and wipe them out so they said to the captain he will come on board it will take you and a few men up and we'll take you and I'll go and meet the Chiefs and we'll sort things out for you we'll trade so he took it the captain and it first mate in different ones up took them up the bush a bit and when they went up there the marys killed them and ate them because they were cannibals I have to tell this because this is so they kill them and eat them and then they dress up in their clothes and then they row the boat out there to to the captain and his first mate a going back out to the the boy there's about 70 people men women children on there and so they they come back to this this boat they get on there at night and they one by one start killing all the people on the ship one of the time people are trying to escape up the mast dive into the water they were canoes around and they they killed about 70 drag them on the shore ate most of them the ones that there was a few they kept as slaves three days prisoners what well this was happen the next day another ship that were Mary Walker came in a canoe and he realized what was happening and he tried to it he was he liked to trade with the Europeans he tried to stop it but he wasn't really successful but as a result of that the people that got caught saw him they actually word got out that this men because he was a more prominent chief he was the one that killed all these people that's important part of the story but he was from a tribe not far down in the bay he tried to stop at videos unsuccessful after that another when word got out what happened another ship came in from the UK and they wanted to take revenge on these people and they'd heard that it was this guy from this tribe that did it so they turned up there they went to that tribe killed the chief and had a war with them and they killed about 30 or 40 of this other tribe which that tribe didn't do it this other tribe did they killed about 30 or 40 of them and and went away again to get revenge on on the burning of the Boyd and that started a war between these two tribes because this one tribe said well we got killed we didn't do anything it was you guys that did it now we got killed for us they started fighting amongst themselves so this is two tribes close to each other now this the man that from the other tribe was t-party 'no he was a he was a good person they actually all were and samuel they'll tell you this so now word got out that that the ship had been burnt all the people killed and eaten and from there people basically said no one go to that god forsaken country all the whaling stopped everything stopped people stopped going there because they said don't go near those cannibals they just you'll turn up there and they'll kill you and eat you that was the reputation that New Zealand had after burning of the Boyd now they'd also put a bit of a hindrance on the plans of these to see missionaries to New Zealand because the two missionaries that we're going to go there suddenly didn't want to go there anymore because you know these guys just been killed and eaten we don't want to go there but Samuel still wanted to go because he said hang on no no I think what happened was they mistreated that guy and they just now this coming from a judge that's quite intense but he said they not like they deserved it but hey they probably mistreated in what they mistreated this guy and they just took revenge on him so he looked at it from more of a different perspective it didn't deter his thoughts about them because he said these the great people they probably just were must treated this why they did what they did not saying it was right but he saw possible he said now I still want to go there and and but two things that happened the first thing that happened was he asked his the government the Europe he could go to and be gone on a mission trip to New Zealand and they said no way the last guys have all been killed there was no way you're going to go on a mission trip to New Zealand cuz he said if we're going to go the owner be the first one that turns up - if there's any danger I'll face it because he he also knew one of the minis so he thought I'll be accountant I know this man that's part of the tribe one of the Chiefs they said no the second thing they had was they couldn't find a ship that was willing to sails in New Zealand and bring them into the bay of islands couldn't find it kept into sailor's ship because they said the last ship that went they got burnt so they couldn't find a ship that someone was the one captain was going to go there and he was going to charge them exorbitant amounts just to to sail over there and seamlessly we can't afford to pay that that's that's just as ridiculous that was extortion so they had this hinderance so I have a guess what Sam you did I like this but because this is the sort of guy he was because he's also bearing in mind he's got this mission and Tahiti that he needs to get to as well you want so so he's got he's got these he's got a problem where he's got no ship and he's got these remote places that he wants to spread the gospel to New Zealand B he wants to help the people in Tahiti so he went out and bought him a ship that's what he did and he explained to his friend he said me buying of the ship has put me in a small amount of financial hardship but we should be right after a while now these this was an expensive sure penny I imagine he used most of his living to buy the ship because he had tried to ask the people back in the UK we need to help me out why should we need to get to these places we can't just leave him cut off he didn't get much of a response or anything so he said to them look I've just brought onboard a ship myself I'll do this thing myself so he bought the ship it was called the active be active now he still wasn't allowed to go on the first trip there but the two men it was a few of them at these were the main men that went now he had told him when you get to the bay of islands go and see this man writer I wasn't I think that was his name you know the man that he'd seen on the ship go and see him and they said when you get there give him Sam you gave from a wheat grinder he said give from this weak minded when you get there though these this is an interesting story but before this man live for his last trip to New Zealand when he actually finally made it Samuel gave him some wheat and he said you wanna grow this and this will you know because he saw the sky was quite commercial and of interest and his way of thinking so he gave him some wheat amongst other things and so this man this this man turns up in the Bay of Islands he's got this wheat seed and he grows all US wheat and he's telling the people this is this is you know those biscuits and things you eat on that you've you've heard from the Whalers and the bread this is from that comes from this and they said no you're crazy it doesn't come from that yes it does I'll show you so they started growing this wheat now the first thing as it started coming up the the people in the tribe out of curiosity went to eat the wheat so they pull it out of the ground to eat the roots because all the other food came from the roots you know like bulbs and things you know that he plan your roots and fern Bracken roots so they started pulling out his wheat well there's you can't eat this he's no no no it's the the wheat comes on top you gotta wait for it to come on top no no so it grew and he harvested this wheat but he then tried to grind up the sweet but he didn't have a grinder we tried to use a coffee grinder but nothing worked to grind this wheat strange a he they don't know why but you didn't think of like getting a mortal and pestle and grinding it but he couldn't actually grind this wheat and so he couldn't show them that this is actually weak that you eat that make the biscuits in the bread and so he became a bit of a joke like oh this guy tries to tell us that it's you know the stuffs what makes the biscuits and yeah you know so they took the sweet and stored it away because it was dry so his reputation I guess had he was kind of like the laughing stock in a sense because he'd even told him about horses is here man there are these big creatures and means sit on them and ride around no no no he would tell him about fruits and they said no no so so he was probably the crazy guy even though he was a chief he was the crazy guy in the village now these men turn up there and they specifically ask for arturro can we go up we want to see him and he knows that they he says look we're from Samuel we want to come and see you now the Samuel said to the people and the government and Australia if these men can go there and if they're safe and if they can bring some Chiefs back with them then you've got to let me go on the second trip back their company be more back with the Chiefs and they agreed to those terms if the men returned back alive and if they've got some of the Chiefs with him then they can accompany you back so they're meeting this men they meet this man rather and they and and then they say oh by the way Joseph told us Samuel told us to give you this some present here this week grinder this is for you and he said wow this is what I needed so he goes and gets all the wheat puts it in the grinder and grinds all the sweet and makes his flour and they quickly baked some cakes some bread and all the Mary's eat the bread and they say he was right this is true this is wheat and he became a hero overnight and they so he said look so they suddenly believed anything Neda said they were like well we should listen to what he says and he said look these mean a good mean this is you know we need to actually invite these men and they're good and so that little incident actually a little wheat grinder it gave that man a lot of esteem amoxil so they were basically listen to anything you see now so seed he said yeah it'll be safe we can all go back on the ship few of us will go back we'll go back to Australia then we'll go and pick him up samuel up because he told them about Samuel and we'll take him back over here and you'll like SEMA he's a good man so so the fame of Samuel amongst that tribe had already spread like they already knew him before he went there as a good person he'd already had quite a high reputation because of the help he'd already done too not just some but a lot of people that went there he helped out and sent them back so this was his reputation went before him so now they went back to Australia and now you can imagine Samuel Samuel when you start to see his life you think you know when he was just a clergyman in England or standing in the in the ministry and he thinks you know I'm just gonna be a minister I'm gonna go and have a church somewhere and preach the gospel and have my family and you know we're just going to do this thing his life was vastly different to what he expected even going on the mission field I'm gonna go on a mission field all he ended up with were British and Irish convicts that he's trying to minister to he's hearing to flog them he's even the guard of business and do all these different things you know you think tweet he is down the track 14 years he's saying man I would not have thought that this was the mission field I was getting a gun you know this is what I was going to be doing it was vastly different and yet it totally fit that look the life he had to live in the mission he had to do was it was very rough and tough and he even getting money to buy ships and all the things he did and as his idea of commerce because then he started realizing if we can give these merry people things and show them this is quite good it helps us in our relationship with him we teach you madam we give them things and help them out and they'll be better and he had this desire to actually enrich their lives all across the board not just in the gospel so you can imagine his excitement when he's actually finally going to get to go to New Zealand and visit these people with the sole intention really of sharing the gospel with him now they arrive and about maybe the 19th or 20th of December 2014 and the word gets around that samuel marsden has arrived and all the chiefs come and the men row they walk us out and they bring them fish and food and all that because this means this man's got a lot of esteem and respect already amongst the people so they they're bringing them food and just to paint the picture of it wasn't just a low-key visit there was the situation that I guess built up over ten years almost you know of culminating in this event it's not just like I will go there and I can you see any people or this I'm over there let's go and maybe try and tell him of the gospel this was a different affair it was actually there were things that work over years and years and years to cause it to have a different atmosphere about it now there was there was rapport there was it was good goodness all around it like that like that like God had sort of walkest rated it to be this way and the atmosphere amongst them was such and so after a few days he went onto the shore to talk and you know they all wanted to see him but he also heard about the fighting between the two tribes one was you know only a mile away but because you know remember the two tribes were fighting because these guys had killed the the guys in the ship these guys didn't they were killed by the Europeans so they were still it was still a war happening and he thought well we can't we're not going to be able to do anything and if these two chiefs these two tribes are fighting each other so he talked to this one try but then he said okay now the ring that was with him was I think John somebody he said now we want to go and see this other tribe and go and meet them and say hello to him so he just walked from them walked over to the other village and talked with them and told them why he was there was there to share the gospel and then either said look can we stay here tonight so him in this other man John they John didn't like the idea because in John's mind he thought here we are we're unprotected it's just him and I we're sleeping amongst cannibals murderers and cannibals and this guy said we're just going to sleep here because seem your said to him whatever they tell you just to just go to sleep here God's going to protect us as nothing's going to happen to us so he just went down and went to sleep that night sleep among the the the guys that they'd all the British people he said no it's gonna be perfectly fine so you sleep there tonight woke up the next day and then he said right I want all that do you Maine Chiefs to come and have breakfast with me on the ship so they all went onto the ship and had breakfast and they they um oh sorry I've got I want to show you that I'm going to first through the so here they are turning up and then this is just pictures of them you know they went to see this other tribe and slip there for the night and there was reconciliation between the two tribes now that may have been a Thursday Friday this happened on the Saturday this men Russ and I knew that on a Sunday was the Sabbath thing you have a service on a Sunday so of his own desire of his own will he he began to set up a place where they could have a church service on the Sunday have divine service Sam we didn't ask him - apparently he just started setting this up himself so he he fenced off about half an acre of land and he made he made a pulpit he put up - and canoes made little seats and because he had seen how churches operate overseas asleep and he made this big area for the church service and he begins telling people we're going to have a church service here tomorrow we have a what we have a church service you all come here tomorrow meet we hear the gospel that's what he did and I'm gonna show you this picture here that's this as there were about three and a half thousand people gathered at this church service and the different tribes were the everyone was there and they they all came I don't even think they knew why they were there but they they just were told that this man's gonna tell us something today I wanna read you Samuel Madison's own words on this to get his thoughts on it to write a a thorough past the remaining part of the previous day on the Saturday and preparing for the Sabbath he enclosed about half an acre of land with a fence he rekted a pulpit and in reading discs in the center and covered the whole either with black native cloth or some duck which he had brought with him from Port Jackson he also procured some bamboos some bottoms of old canoes and fixing up his seats on each side of the pulpit for the Europeans to set upon including to have divine service there the next day these preparations he made of his own accord and then the evening and for me that everything was ready for divine service I was much pleased with the singular mark of his attention the reading disc was about three feet from the ground in the pulpit about six feet the black cloth covered the top of the pulpit and hung over the sides the bottom of the pulpit as well as a reading desk was part of a canoe the whole was becoming and had a solemn appearance he had also erected a Flagstaff on the highest hill in the village which had a commanding view on Sunday morning when I was up on the deck I saw the English flag flying so this marionette had set up a mast and flew on the English flag up which was a pleasing sight in New Zealand I considered it as a signal of the dawn of civilization and liberty and religion and that dark and benighted land I never viewed the British colors with more gratification and flatter myself that they would never be removed till all the natives of this island enjoyed all the happiness of British subjects this was this more political mind but then he said at about 10 o'clock we prepared to go ashore to publish for the first on the glad tidings of the gospel I was under no apprehension for the safety of the vessel and therefore ordered all on board to go on shore to attend divine service except the master and one man when we landed we found Cora Cora tortilla and Shengo I don't know her say his name dress and regimentals which Governor McGuire had given him when they're in Australia was the amend rule not ready to be Martian to the enclosure to attend divine service they had their swords by their side their switches in their hands we entered the enclosure and we're placed on the seats on each side of the pulpit corporal marches men and place them on my right hand and the rear of the Europeans and Toronto because he was the chief places men on the left the inhabitans of the town was the woman and children in a number of other chiefs formed a circle around the hole a very solemn silence prevailed the sight was truly impressive so you can imagine years and years and years and now this thing is unfolded to wear now you can imagine see me with this about three and a half thousand people there and he's had this desire to preach the gospel through these these people for years and years and years and suddenly it's happened what a what an awesome time it would have been for him to to there and then he's about to get up and start and and preach the the gospel of Jesus Christ then he says I I rose up and began singing the service was singing the old 100-some and felt my very soul melt within me when I viewed my congregation and considered the state that they were in so seeing the hundreds I'm I managed to track down the words this is an old song but the words are quite fitting this was written by Isaac Watts he said before jehovah's awesome throne ye nations bowel with sacred joy know that the Lord is God alone he can create and he destroy his sovereign power without our aid made us of clay informed us then and when like wandering sheep we strayed he brought us to his fold again will crowd thy gates with thankful songs high as the heavens our voices raised and earth with her ten thousand tongues shall fill thy courts was sounding praise why does the world as I command vast as eternity that I love firm as a rock by truth must stand when rolling years cease to move when rolling years shall cease to move so his him a hundred son and then he preached the first Christian service ever to behold in this country and the subject he preached on was Luke - 10 - 11 and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and that was his first message to the people of New Zealand I don't think that's an amazing story and and that's that's made this country what it is part of making this country what it is I'm part of the the I often think back talking to brother Kubek like even I thought it this morning when I saw a brother Edie and brother kuben embrace you know and do that now maybe you're on video you can't see them but brother kuben is Indian South African and brother Eaters there's a white South African but they embrace and brother Kuby and said to me you know what beckons today for he didn't like me I didn't like him we didn't talk he said but here we're brothers and and and that's the power of the gospel of this country his has its has created a love in this place and it's I'm thankful for men like samuel marsden they actually devoted his life to wanting to bring the gospel here so praise the Lord that some think about that because that's that's you're all part of a plan to wasn't just semi we're all part of a plan God's got a plan he had a plan for all of us and he's still got a plan for this place he's still with a plan for our neighbors for different places he still has a plan and we're still part of his plan maybe let's just in closing I think it might be fitting listening I'm God defend New Zealand who'd like to sing that one I'd like to sing that song the the the words and the song are so fantastic
