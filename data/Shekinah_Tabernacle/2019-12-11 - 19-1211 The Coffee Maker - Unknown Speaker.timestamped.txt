[21:32] the subject now so we'll read the
[21:34] scriptures first and then I'll introduce
[21:36] you to what what was laid on my heart
[21:39] and it's a while ago so but maybe before
[21:42] I jump in this is son this is a Sunday
[21:45] School lesson okay
[21:46] now when I say Sunday school listen I
[21:49] don't mean to look down on anybody if
[21:53] you've ever been in a proper Sunday
[21:55] School lesson Exhibit A to my left any
[21:59] of those rooms is for me a proper Sunday
[22:02] school there's this substance there's
[22:05] this teaching there's lessons that's
[22:07] coming out there there's truth right and
[22:10] 100% truth and and and in word and so
[22:16] I'm bringing you that I'm bringing you a
[22:17] bit of a
[22:18] a condensed version of hopefully a
[22:22] sermon that could be taught and if you
[22:25] have some grace for me this evening it's
[22:27] a it's a subject that's dear to my heart
[22:29] and if you can if you can watch it from
[22:33] from your spiritual lens your spiritual
[22:35] eye you might you might get something
[22:38] out of this so please be gracious it's
[22:41] practical for the kids to to relate
[22:45] hopefully they don't relate too much
[22:47] okay anyway I don't want to it's don't
[22:49] want to spoil it yet let's read the
[22:51] first scripture the first scripture is
[22:52] Isaiah 55 we will start from verse 11 if
[22:57] you can't read there again apologies for
[23:01] that
[23:01] it's our 55 from verse 10
[23:10] [Music]
[23:23] verse 10 for as the rain cometh down and
[23:28] the snow from heaven and returneth not
[23:31] thither but watereth the earth and make
[23:33] of the bring forth and bud that it may
[23:37] give seed to the sower and bread to the
[23:40] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[23:43] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[23:46] return unto me void but it shall
[23:48] accomplish that which I please and it
[23:51] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[23:54] sent it for ye shall go out with joy and
[23:57] be led forth with peace the mountains
[24:01] and the hills shall psyche shake forth
[24:04] sorry break forth before you into
[24:06] singing and all the trees of the field
[24:09] shall clap their hands I love that I
[24:11] love that and the next one is Romans 8
[24:14] Romans 8 from verse 17 I've got one
[24:20] quick more Scripture before I sorry
[24:22] after that and then you may take your
[24:24] seats
[24:25] so Romans 8 from verse 17 and if
[24:31] children then here's here's of God and
[24:37] joint his with Christ if so be that we
[24:41] suffer with him that we may also glorify
[24:45] together be glorified together for I
[24:47] reckon that the sufferings of this
[24:50] present time are not worthy to be
[24:52] compared to the glory which shall be
[24:54] revealed in us in us for the earnest
[24:58] expectation this is what I want to get
[25:01] to the earnest expectation of the
[25:02] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[25:05] of the sons of God there's a waiting
[25:08] there's expectation of Hope excitements
[25:11] coming over the pulpit now quite a bit
[25:14] and then the last one is 1 Peter 4 first
[25:19] Peter 4 verse 11 if any man speak let
[25:25] him speak as
[25:27] Oracles of God if any man minister let
[25:31] him do it as of the ability of which God
[25:34] giveth that God and all things may be
[25:36] glorified through Jesus Christ to whom
[25:39] be praise and Dominion for ever and ever
[25:43] amen
[25:46] bless the reading of his word you may be
[25:49] seated
[25:50] Saints and again I ask you that it can
[25:53] be various for my message today so I'll
[25:58] just go back to that previous slide that
[25:59] would have given you indication or a
[26:02] hint on the on your right little picture
[26:04] if you don't know what it is by the fool
[26:06] you may not answer but that the next one
[26:12] will probably give you a bit more of a
[26:14] of a hint yes yes that's what I want to
[26:18] hear
[26:20] so my subject tonight the coffee maker
[26:25] something that's dear to my heart if you
[26:28] know me and look I've been I've been
[26:34] part of this message end and and and
[26:36] since I've been I've never looked to the
[26:39] world and to my my interests and
[26:42] everything the same right the Lord
[26:45] brought forth aney he unveiled to me a
[26:47] lot of things you reveal to me and while
[26:50] you walk in your daily walk daily life
[26:52] you go to work you go to home you play
[26:54] golf you played you know go fishing
[26:55] you're not looking the same way as you
[26:58] as you look before you're doing the same
[27:00] things right and I wanted to bring you I
[27:04] don't want to jump too much ahead but I
[27:06] don't want to I wanted to bring like a
[27:08] little glasses like you know you get
[27:11] these three-dimensional glasses one of
[27:13] the boys at homes got a book and it's
[27:16] got massive tires and 4x4 cars and the
[27:19] mud looks like it's spitting you know
[27:21] out of the pages when you put on those
[27:24] glasses take it off and it's all blurry
[27:26] it's all - can't figure it out put it on
[27:28] and it comes alive right so I want you
[27:31] I'm pleading with you tonight to put on
[27:34] those spiritual lenses that spiritual
[27:36] eyes and everything that I will tell you
[27:39] look at the spiritual meaning the
[27:43] spiritual significance behind it and
[27:46] while while I've been studying and
[27:49] researching all this about coffee I
[27:51] which is I was amazed by all the little
[27:54] tidbits that that I could relate
[27:56] spiritually and put it back to the word
[27:58] and and look at like wow am I this this
[28:00] is this has been a real revelation so
[28:03] yes please follow with me okay so I
[28:09] talked about glasses right okay next
[28:13] slide
[28:13] let's see now this is this is my house
[28:17] so on your left is a coffee tree a small
[28:21] one it's busy trying to grow the in the
[28:25] in the backyard for multiple reasons it
[28:30] should fail but it is still going
[28:33] there's still new leaves on the top I'm
[28:36] watering it and giving it what I can
[28:38] it's going on well on the right might
[28:41] look a bit weird okay so we've got do we
[28:44] have I've got a pointer here some way is
[28:47] that this thing ha ha ha
[28:49] so that who could tell me what's that
[28:52] it's a popcorn maker a popcorn maker I
[29:00] roast my coffee with a popcorn maker so
[29:04] through all my research and my my
[29:08] excitement when I saw big old drum
[29:12] coffee machines and that's when I saw it
[29:15] just before I saw the price tag I
[29:17] thought ok let's turn it down a notch so
[29:19] I've done my oven roasting it works I've
[29:22] done my K Dec barbecue scott'll dry
[29:25] roasting it works sort of I think
[29:28] Brotherhood month still got a video of
[29:31] that that was my very very first one I
[29:33] put the K Dec dry inside the the kitchen
[29:36] ironically and I was Brian's just
[29:38] smoking everything out and just thought
[29:41] it was yeah it was it was fun it was fun
[29:44] right and then there is a single origin
[29:48] mojo green bean from
[29:52] Tamala so what's next next is so that's
[29:58] the inside of the packet that is a a
[30:01] unroasted or green bean and it's a
[30:05] Rebecca bean we won't go into the detail
[30:07] and on the right is what they call
[30:12] husking or chefing right so you can't
[30:15] see anything on this being you can have
[30:18] it up close you won't see any anything
[30:22] else that's supposed to be on this
[30:23] coffee bean that needs to fall off that
[30:26] needs to change or disappear or whatever
[30:29] and again I'm bringing you back to the
[30:32] spiritual reasons now right there
[30:35] chefing so remember that okay
[30:38] so let's see what do I have now ah okay
[30:41] the into the in product right so that's
[30:45] that's after my roasting after it comes
[30:48] out of the coffee or the popcorn maker
[30:52] probably about seven minutes roasting in
[30:55] that thing it's about 30 grand or sorry
[30:57] probably about 60 70 grams of coffee in
[31:02] depending what type of bean it is weird
[31:04] it's from which origin so we call we
[31:07] that's not like a professional they call
[31:10] the the important coffee beans the
[31:14] coffee belt or the bean belt so if you
[31:16] look across the globe
[31:17] you've got South America Colombia in the
[31:20] in Geneva Papua New Guinea
[31:22] Vanuatu all those places that's got a
[31:25] high altitude good rainfall moisture not
[31:29] too cold Wellington so perfect perfect
[31:34] conditions for for growing good coffee
[31:36] right a good old brother of mine brother
[31:39] Joseph Bayley done and and Taranaki gave
[31:43] me some of his or some of the local
[31:45] Roasterie coffee and that's me trying to
[31:48] trying to make something pretty like
[31:50] like that but that was me I just want to
[31:53] say that was me yeah so exciting stuff
[31:58] from the beginning to the end I'll take
[31:59] you through the process now of yeah
[32:03] what what it's like now this is a I just
[32:06] like the picture you know pyramid so
[32:08] here at the bottom we have the world
[32:11] coffee of the commercial grade coffee
[32:13] those that like McDonald's coffee hands
[32:15] up while being coffee all those a
[32:19] Starbucks I don't know how to spell that
[32:21] even then I don't like it then then you
[32:25] have the preparation coffee I would say
[32:27] there's a there's a there's a few local
[32:30] Roasters around that's that's probably
[32:32] sitting in that then don't worry about
[32:35] this the standard label goes so here
[32:39] this this is now where they put a label
[32:41] on it it's a bronze medal or a sole
[32:44] votes you know part of the gold standard
[32:46] order and we get into the single origin
[32:49] so I showed you that green bean from
[32:52] Guatemala so this would be from a
[32:54] roasted perspective they would roast it
[32:57] to perfection for that particular
[32:58] country or bean and then you have this
[33:02] state coffee now I can mention one and
[33:05] that's the Blue Mountain coffee I'm
[33:07] still after it people on the web all the
[33:09] locals if you know where I can get some
[33:12] Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee single
[33:15] origin I would be most grateful it's
[33:17] probably about two hundred and ten
[33:24] dollars per 100 gram if I remember
[33:26] correctly yes they said at the top the
[33:31] cream at the top spiritual reasons then
[33:35] we sit at the top it's we're not
[33:40] boasting we're not but we've walked this
[33:43] walk right we've we've been in the
[33:45] commercial grade we've been you know the
[33:48] McDonald's coffee we've gone up the
[33:50] ladder because of Revelation because of
[33:52] surrender because of a multitude of
[33:55] things because of a geographical move a
[33:57] shake that the Lord had to give you to
[34:01] shake off their checking so we'll get to
[34:03] that now right and then here's just well
[34:10] it's a bit small sorry about that but
[34:13] this is a estimation of two million and
[34:17] eighty three cups
[34:19] of coffee every five minutes which
[34:23] equates to around I think an estimated
[34:25] 1.6 billion cups being drank each day
[34:30] across the globe the step was something
[34:34] like eight eight hundred million cups
[34:40] that McDonald's would serve only in the
[34:42] US a day something I can't remember
[34:45] it is it's significant right so I just
[34:48] wanted to show you some fun stats and
[34:50] what do I do when I have time off so now
[34:57] we're getting into the nitty-gritty
[35:00] Coffee is not better
[35:06] doesn't matter whoever tells you what
[35:08] coffee proper coffee is not better you
[35:13] do not have to add sugar really trust me
[35:19] and I've walked that walk so I've been
[35:23] I've been in South Africa and I've had
[35:25] my Rico cough my Rico Hassad Rico Frisco
[35:29] Rico Frisco and Rico coffee you know two
[35:32] spoons of coffee three spoons of sugar
[35:34] you know and you'll have eight cups of
[35:37] that today an area where it's just awful
[35:39] right back we know is a student we had
[35:44] this little regular ketchup thing after
[35:48] church on a Sunday evening we'll go over
[35:50] to what they call it's a franchise
[35:51] called mug and bean and mag and bean has
[35:54] got about five or six urns full of
[35:57] coffee different flavors and you can you
[36:01] you you you pay for a cup or a mug and
[36:03] you can go fill up as much as you want
[36:05] throughout that day or night so after
[36:08] church we will go there that's probably
[36:09] about eight o'clock or so and we'll sit
[36:12] there till whenever because of his
[36:14] students right so we never really I
[36:17] didn't you know drank alcohol or smoked
[36:20] a lot and that bake was not smoked a lot
[36:22] drank a lot and smoked nothing but I
[36:25] drank a lot of coffee so I think the one
[36:28] night I finished about eleven probably
[36:31] of those cups
[36:32] those mugs and that's that's when I
[36:35] found the revelation that that will keep
[36:38] you awake yeah so I've had that
[36:42] revelation I've walked that road now
[36:45] what I have there up there is
[36:46] revelations 22 verse 18 for I testify
[36:50] unto every man that heareth the words of
[36:52] the prophecy of this book If any man
[36:54] shall add unto these things God shall
[36:56] add unto Him the plagues that are
[36:58] written in this book
[37:00] first time I've read this I said thank
[37:03] the Lord I'm part of the message there's
[37:06] nothing at is nothing away but when you
[37:09] read church he's talking about you as
[37:11] well
[37:12] he's talking about a bit individual walk
[37:14] and I started thinking oh my
[37:16] if God's that serious you can be in any
[37:22] organization denomination you can have
[37:25] your own personal walk you need to make
[37:27] very very sure you're not adding or
[37:30] taking away from the word and it's gonna
[37:36] be hard it's gonna be tough some of the
[37:40] things are so easy I think who talked
[37:44] about it brother nd you talked about it
[37:45] last Sunday it's easy to stop smoking
[37:47] and in some people's lives
[37:51] some I'm swearing and and drinking and
[37:54] all this kind of that's the easy bit
[37:56] right and that's when when God's got out
[38:00] there's big old vital what's a vital in
[38:04] English pick ax picks X probably a
[38:08] hammer and chisel here we go chisel
[38:10] hammer and a chisel and he's standing
[38:12] and he's knocking out you know big
[38:15] chunks that falls off I'm trying to
[38:17] unfreeze some of the stuff in my deep
[38:19] freezer so I'm there with a knife and a
[38:21] hammer and everything to get all the ice
[38:23] loose bit jumps fall off but one shot
[38:29] with the with the chisel on your arm is
[38:31] going to be ouch right but if someone
[38:34] comes with a little sandpaper and do
[38:35] this that's gonna be significant that's
[38:38] gonna be hurtful that's gonna be so it's
[38:42] gonna maybe take a bit longer to heal
[38:44] than just one
[38:46] with a chisel right and that's where I
[38:48] am that's where you are we we are being
[38:51] polished we are being sanded we're being
[38:53] made to perfection in His image he wants
[38:56] to see himself in us now not finished
[39:02] black coffee no sugar no cream okay I
[39:06] drink some cream some some some milk but
[39:10] what I want to read here for you is and
[39:12] thou shalt shall possess the gate of his
[39:15] enemy this 1962 brother branham sees an
[39:17] organization a church that's the reason
[39:21] why we find our organizations falling by
[39:24] the wayside is because when it comes to
[39:27] the tests what tests God's Word that's
[39:29] the test God's Word is the test what we
[39:33] do what a bunch of men sees do or will
[39:35] we do what God says do that's the
[39:37] difference there it comes the days of
[39:40] Dwight moodily moody the the days of
[39:43] Finney Sankey Knox Calvin Spurgeon all
[39:46] the rest of them those spiritual men are
[39:47] like this the organization's followed
[39:50] after them they didn't started there was
[39:53] the I think that's how I read this there
[39:55] was a sincerity in their heart and gods
[39:57] placed the message there to bring forth
[39:59] but but people crowded and and that's it
[40:03] that's that's that's the sayeth and we
[40:05] need to go and it was in that day but
[40:07] again it's a spiritual its individual
[40:10] walk you have to you have to do not form
[40:14] and that's what it comes now they've got
[40:16] a bunch of men back V that's cut their
[40:19] way into that each one believing this
[40:21] and that adding a little here taking
[40:23] with a little away V adding a little
[40:25] until finally they made an organization
[40:28] out of it that's the coffee tree so on
[40:36] the left as as all the cherries on the
[40:39] right is just that previous beta these
[40:41] are there's a nice white flower that
[40:45] comes around springtime and then late
[40:46] summer they become this this red color
[40:50] there's a bit of green it's in a bit of
[40:52] a yellow orange E and then and then red
[40:55] that red means ready red means they
[40:57] ready to be picked
[41:01] the beans or sorry that so that
[41:04] yeah but cheery consists out of out of
[41:09] the out of flesh that you see there the
[41:10] red and inside there's two beans we
[41:13] refer to it as beans but it's actually
[41:15] seed and again put your spiritual hats
[41:17] on he's talking about seed inside what
[41:20] you see there I can't do anything with
[41:22] it
[41:23] it looks beautiful the flowers nice but
[41:27] there's a cheery coming and it's red the
[41:28] flesh on the outside is beautiful
[41:30] everything on the outside right you can
[41:33] you can color it you can wash it you can
[41:36] polish it it's not useful to me I can't
[41:39] use that it needs to be proceeding needs
[41:42] to be refined and needs to what needs to
[41:44] do what's what's inside needs to come
[41:46] out right and that's where I want to get
[41:48] now so how do I go on here there we go
[42:02] in 1953 brother branham said we are in
[42:08] his making so we are perfected in three
[42:11] soul body and spirit and our body is
[42:14] controlled of nerves and bloods and
[42:16] cells flesh three all perfected in three
[42:19] so I thought wow okay
[42:20] you've got this flesh and then the two
[42:22] beans or seeds inside and I thought if
[42:25] the ones that spirit maybe in the ones
[42:28] the soul they outside the flesh right if
[42:32] what what we striving for is to to let
[42:36] our spirit become what is our soul what
[42:39] is our driving factor right that's that
[42:42] that's when when you alone when you when
[42:45] you are when you are away from
[42:47] fellowship when you are when the when
[42:49] the tire hits the road that's when the
[42:52] the white dog and black dog wants to
[42:54] fight yeah every time right and that's
[42:57] growth that character that building
[42:59] there when we'll get to that part of the
[43:00] character building I want my spirit of
[43:04] my soul to look exactly the same right
[43:07] and how do I get there well a bit
[43:11] through a bit of trial but yeah I just
[43:15] thought man and three that's that's
[43:16] basically what it's it's it's it's it's
[43:19] made out of out of those three but I
[43:23] need to get the flesh out of the way to
[43:25] get to my spirit in my soul right so the
[43:30] best way to process to get there is what
[43:33] they call a wit process so this is where
[43:36] this is where my journey started when I
[43:40] sorry to burst your bubble but the
[43:42] sunday-school has had a very condensed
[43:44] elation on this way back and I thought
[43:47] but I'm not done yet I want to I want to
[43:49] just dig in a bit more so sorry for
[43:54] those that that some of those rings a
[43:56] bell for kids I think they might have
[43:58] forgetten already right so the best way
[44:02] to process those beans is what they call
[44:04] a wit process to get a clean green bean
[44:08] but quotes oh sorry the scripture I've
[44:11] got out there everyone knows that then
[44:12] Peter said unto them drip
[44:14] pens and be baptized every one of you in
[44:16] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[44:18] remission of sins and you shall receive
[44:20] the gift of the Holy Ghost so just as an
[44:29] FYI there on that right hand side is the
[44:32] washed which most of the most of the
[44:36] organic growers and and the top Markey
[44:40] growers would use so I've got this the
[44:44] squirts from brother Brennan this the
[44:45] great servant Moses beautiful type of it
[44:47] when Jesus said in the wilderness that
[44:49] he was the rock that was in the
[44:51] wilderness now one of the people
[44:52] screamed back they that day when he came
[44:55] into Jerusalem riding on that horse at
[44:57] little mule and they were crying those
[45:00] Nazarenes crying Hosanna Hosanna to him
[45:02] that cometh in the name of the Lord some
[45:05] of those self-styled starchy priests
[45:07] it'd make them hold their peace
[45:09] why he said if they hold their peace the
[45:12] rocks will immediately cry out what does
[45:15] the rocks the rocks has been washed by
[45:17] the same waters and watered by the word
[45:20] they have to cry out that if they hold
[45:24] their peace
[45:25] the rocks will immediately cry out
[45:27] something had to take place and what I
[45:31] what I love about this is this whole
[45:36] process and I and I love nature and be
[45:39] so close to God's creation there's a law
[45:42] there's there's something that needs to
[45:45] happen in a certain order everything
[45:47] needs to go through a certain a period
[45:50] of its life a season and everything and
[45:52] it comes to just look to creation to
[45:56] find out what is what what is God busy
[45:59] with there's a you know summer winter
[46:01] spring autumn there's a season and
[46:04] something's happening in that even in
[46:06] nature and even if the rocks are going
[46:08] to cry out then how much more do we need
[46:11] to cry out then and get on this road
[46:13] that's mean for us okay so you can't see
[46:19] the green bean anymore here this this
[46:21] has been roasted and on that green bean
[46:25] I wish I brought you some sorry about
[46:26] that
[46:27] is you can see nothing it's there's a
[46:30] bit of a shine on it but I can't use it
[46:33] like I can't eat it I can't drink it
[46:36] like that it's horrible it doesn't smell
[46:38] like anything where's Jessie Jessie can
[46:40] you remember I brought that green coffee
[46:42] beans in that it smell like anything
[46:44] that didn't smell like anything I yeah
[46:46] so I had three different beans there I
[46:49] had the green bean and I and I roasted
[46:51] it to about two minutes nothing happened
[46:53] maybe a bit of chefing fell off roasted
[46:55] to three or four minutes start off a
[46:58] bouquet and I'll get to that now the
[46:59] smell smells like almost like a bread
[47:02] like smell of baking bread you know but
[47:07] you're expecting a coffee smell so no
[47:10] way through this process you are
[47:11] smelling coffee it's it's different
[47:13] smells and burns and all this to get
[47:16] this chafing off but nothing about
[47:17] coffee
[47:19] so yes the the roasting process starting
[47:23] now so from the green bean you can't see
[47:26] any any of this husk or this chafing and
[47:29] even before that first crack so now I'm
[47:32] pouring it into my roaster okay a
[47:34] popcorn machine and switch it on starts
[47:38] with a hot air and it's circulating
[47:40] around the bean and it's heating up all
[47:42] the beans quite evenly and before so
[47:45] there's this different stages of this
[47:47] coffee you get a first crack and it
[47:50] sounds like a popcorn cracking and a few
[47:53] minutes later you get a second crack or
[47:55] very softer crack that's when I start
[47:58] getting excited because I know okay time
[48:00] is right I can chuck it out and and and
[48:02] and start looking at cooling this
[48:04] process down and even before that first
[48:09] crack so Mike popcorn machine and that's
[48:12] why it's so efficient is it blows all
[48:14] the Chaffin out so in a pan or in the
[48:17] oven
[48:17] you've got chefing everywhere you know
[48:19] it's just it's a mess to clean up
[48:21] and the same with my little k dog BBQ it
[48:23] was just a walk so I had to get that out
[48:26] otherwise that burns more and yeah it's
[48:29] just a mess but the spork own maker does
[48:31] it quite well for me so I use that
[48:34] regularly and has the heat builds up
[48:37] that chef that
[48:39] husk begins to separate and it falls
[48:41] away from the seed okay so in our walk
[48:45] and I'm praising the Lord and I'm
[48:47] reading my Bible and I look at my family
[48:50] altar in the morning before my first
[48:51] coffee and I go praise the Lord this is
[48:54] a walk this is a lot three months later
[48:56] you like whoa that's a missus a lot of
[48:59] chefing lying around here but I'm not
[49:01] smoking anymore I'm not drinking I'm not
[49:03] not satisfied by anything that the world
[49:06] can give me keep on walking keep on
[49:09] roasting it's sometimes hard a trial by
[49:11] fire we'll get to that now and but the
[49:14] chaff thing is falling off right do you
[49:17] get to that first crack that that almost
[49:21] a masterpiece we'll get to that now so
[49:24] what I have here is the unwelcomed
[49:27] Christ 1955 Simon said master if you
[49:30] only knew what kind of woman that was
[49:32] she's speaking now if the prostitute
[49:34] Jesus said Simon I've got something to
[49:37] tell you you invited me to your home you
[49:40] didn't wash my feet you never give me
[49:41] any oil my face you didn't even kiss me
[49:44] welcome but this poor woman ever since
[49:48] she's coming here she's continually
[49:49] kissing my feet washing my feet with her
[49:52] tears wiped them with her hair
[49:54] then he turns to the poor prostitute
[49:57] looking at him she's standing there he
[50:01] is dripping down the tears all staining
[50:03] her cheeks she wondered what he was
[50:06] going to say is he going to rebuke her
[50:08] and say get over out of here you awful
[50:11] woman no he turned to her and he said
[50:15] child your sins which are many is all
[50:19] forgiven your faith in me has made you
[50:23] whole all their chefing gone in a wink
[50:28] of an eye if you carry on with that
[50:30] message is just beautiful help brother
[50:32] branham's coloring that in and oh yeah
[50:35] it just made me excited so they the
[50:40] worst of the worst call it the worst
[50:43] MacDonald Coffee Bean chefing will fall
[50:47] off chefing will fall off if you go
[50:50] through the fire if
[50:52] go through the roasting process there's
[50:54] a law and there's our order for everyone
[50:58] yesterday today and forever the same so
[51:03] first crack first cracks happened and
[51:05] you have this earthy tone earthy it
[51:08] smells of the world the earth
[51:10] smells like baking bread but nowhere
[51:12] near how coffee should smell yet so we
[51:16] waiting still continuing on I don't
[51:18] switch the roaster now off because I
[51:20] don't smell coffee I continue on I read
[51:23] my Bible I push on I get to fellowship
[51:28] storms coming and all that kind of thing
[51:30] I find a way to get to church so that
[51:33] can get a beautiful message from mother
[51:35] any loss Sunday please go and watch that
[51:38] again it's just amazing how you know
[51:42] we're just thankful for the for the
[51:44] ministers in our midst
[51:46] now we get to the second crack so like I
[51:49] said I get exciting now much much much
[51:51] less chaffing right but there's this
[51:54] inside crack that's inside stirring this
[51:58] softer crack this something's happening
[52:01] Lord what is this now you are in that
[52:04] quality coffee tasting zone now you know
[52:08] you're getting somewhere there's a
[52:10] woofed in the air that earthiness is
[52:13] gone there's a there's a chocolate eNOS
[52:16] there's a there's a rum a filling this
[52:18] and if you continue on hopefully I've
[52:22] got there here yes if you continue on
[52:29] you get to that bit which they call a
[52:33] fringe roast I don't often roast this
[52:35] this is just personal preference but
[52:38] they're certain beans you can roast to a
[52:39] French or a dark roast now that Ben has
[52:44] not each been individually polished that
[52:47] is oil being excreted from the inside
[52:51] oil coming out this is just the roasting
[52:55] process so from green it goes all the
[52:57] way till we have a cup of coffee but
[53:00] that for me was amazing I thought it was
[53:04] marketing I thought there was you know
[53:05] but Harris you know do something and put
[53:08] something in their bag to make this all
[53:09] shiny when you open it up but being
[53:12] itself its gets it gets so dry and it
[53:15] gets so dark in that roasting process
[53:17] that oil becomes to come out it's just
[53:21] wonderful to see and yeah again through
[53:25] your spiritual lenses what's that
[53:27] oil inside you that wine in oil beloved
[53:36] think of it not strange concerning the
[53:39] fiery trial which is to try you as
[53:43] though some strange thing happened unto
[53:45] you but rejoice in as much as you are
[53:47] partakers of Christ's suffering that
[53:50] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[53:53] be glad also with exceeding joy so I
[53:59] call this the this is a Edwin Odia
[54:02] terminology I call this the third crack
[54:04] and that's when you actually actually
[54:06] have to grind the coffee I can look at
[54:09] that beam I can they do beautiful
[54:11] artistic things with coffee beans I
[54:14] can't drink that I need to grind it I
[54:17] need to go through the grind and that's
[54:19] why I'm say that polishing phase that
[54:21] sandpaper phase when when you go through
[54:24] that burr grind and everything needs to
[54:26] be less of me and more of him that's
[54:29] when when them when the bouquet comes
[54:32] out that coffee bean and the and the
[54:35] grind can sit next to each other the
[54:38] grind smells better than the coffee bean
[54:40] it's a fact right and to get that aroma
[54:43] and that bouquet out of it
[54:45] it needs to get to its final stage its
[54:48] final destination and something I
[54:52] mentioned earlier is the best beans grow
[54:56] at altitude so we're sitting here on or
[55:01] no altitude here in Wellington but the
[55:04] best beans Jamaica Peru South America
[55:07] Brazil Brazil is the largest exporter of
[55:10] or grower of coffee
[55:13] they've got altitude to work with and we
[55:16] need to go up
[55:17] we need to get into the mountains and
[55:21] the high mountains the Blue Mountains
[55:25] so at thy word 1951 may every person in
[55:29] here that's bound by sense bound
[55:32] existence only trusting and that what
[55:36] you can see here taste the fuel smell
[55:39] may they fall away from that tonight go
[55:42] up into the reales to the high of the
[55:44] higher and may this church literally be
[55:47] rocked with a with the power of God and
[55:51] that's what I'm praying tonight send the
[55:54] Holy Spirit may every angel that you've
[55:57] ordained to be at this meeting tonight
[55:59] take his place now standing by the sick
[56:02] and afflicted by the sinner by the
[56:03] skeptic Lord send the angel that stood
[56:06] at Baia by thy servant then proclaim
[56:08] these things that I've spoken to be true
[56:11] that they'll know it comes from not a
[56:14] man
[56:14] it comes from God hear me father hear me
[56:17] for I ask it in the name of your son
[56:19] Jesus Christ and to finish it off I like
[56:28] this quote 1957 as the Eagle stirs up
[56:33] this nest I remember the night when God
[56:36] made that scream to me you're not of
[56:39] this world you're not of them chickens
[56:41] you're not a chicken to begin with
[56:42] you're an eagle you're mine and I've
[56:44] come for you now honey up and listen to
[56:47] my word listen to my word I pray that
[56:52] this very nice re just a little jump and
[56:55] a flop of your little wings she's
[56:57] circling the barnyard oh I pray that
[57:00] this hour he's circling the barnyard
[57:03] you're mine you belong to me there's
[57:05] nothing about this voice that I
[57:07] understood that he that he understood
[57:09] well it was goodbye chicken yard he made
[57:13] a great big flop with his little wings
[57:15] and he landed right on top of the
[57:16] barnyard post he's seen he had done
[57:19] something that's a little rock falling
[57:21] off that of that big old mountain but
[57:25] did the rock fall off that that pair of
[57:26] people fall off yes I did keep on
[57:29] walking
[57:31] his mother screamed against it honey
[57:33] you've got to come higher than that I
[57:35] think we do too we've got to come higher
[57:38] than an under an organization or
[57:40] denomination or a confession
[57:42] she said just simply make another jump
[57:46] and flop with all that's in ooh I'll
[57:49] catch you on my wings and I'll bear you
[57:51] up to the place where you ought to be
[57:55] and it was just beautiful that brother
[57:59] Andy means in it on Sunday and that's
[58:01] how it all tie together with mine and I
[58:03] thought Lord yes this must be something
[58:06] in there must be of you so with this
[58:09] whole literal thinking of the coffee
[58:13] process you go think oh wow it's quite a
[58:17] science you know it's much more complex
[58:19] than I thought well I'll tell you this I
[58:23] think personally we are the most complex
[58:26] individuals on this earth and why you
[58:31] can't explain this to the world
[58:33] you can't explain the Godhead to the
[58:35] world you can't sit down and explain ma
[58:38] agape true love to this world we've
[58:41] talked about this brother ful at my
[58:42] house how do we how do we if only the
[58:46] world found the true definition of love
[58:49] according to thy word and not anything
[58:52] else what a difference it will be and
[58:56] why are we the most complex individuals
[58:59] because he hides in simplicity there's
[59:04] less of me and there's more of him and
[59:06] he can do his work thank you very much
[59:10] for tonight hope you got something out
[59:14] of it the Lord's good to me and go to my
