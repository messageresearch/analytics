[8:02] so i was informed of uh how to structure

[25:11] sorry i just put them on the spot i
[25:14] greet you all in the name of our lord
[25:15] jesus christ
[25:17] you see if you can hear if you want to
[25:19] do something for the lord
[25:21] i believe and you you hear
[25:25] something that wants to to discourage
[25:28] you
[25:29] or to to disallow you to come and do it
[25:32] for the lord you must know that's the
[25:34] devil
[25:35] that's the bold statement but if you
[25:37] want to do something for the lord
[25:38] according to his word
[25:40] and then something pulls you away from
[25:43] it
[25:43] just know that's the devil so just do it
[25:46] amen so i'm sitting there and i've been
[25:48] having this song on my heart
[25:51] for some time and
[25:56] there's there's just something about a
[25:57] good a good old-time christian
[26:01] there's something about that um we might
[26:04] be living in this
[26:05] modern time and you know somehow
[26:09] sometimes become modern christians but
[26:10] there's something about a good a good
[26:12] old christian
[26:14] you know that is why malachi chapter 4
[26:16] wants to take us back
[26:18] to to be the good old-time christian
[26:20] there's just something about that amen
[26:23] and we want to sing this song maybe we
[26:25] start with the choruses
[26:27] then i believe there was no
[26:30] there was no you know sometimes we
[26:34] i get confused with keys
[26:37] but i believe the kids that we have
[26:40] today you know
[26:41] might have not been tuned this way when
[26:43] they were singing have an angel signal
[26:45] i don't know what keys they were going
[26:47] they were going in but i believe it was
[26:49] the holy spirit key amen
[26:54] and all our instruments and things
[26:55] they're just trying to get to that key
[26:57] so i decided to rather just go direct to
[26:59] that
[27:00] amen i would rather be an
[27:04] old-time christian than anything
[27:08] i know sorry forgot my classes

[27:22] [Music]

[48:57] and we're good then we're going to go to
[48:58] uh first samuel 17. so
[49:11] matthew 27 and and 27.
[49:16] then the soldiers of the governor took
[49:19] jesus into the common hall and gathered
[49:21] unto him the whole band of soldiers and
[49:22] they stripped him and they put
[49:24] on him a scarlet robe and when they had
[49:27] planted a crown of thorns they put it
[49:29] upon his head and a reed in his right
[49:31] hand and they bowed the knee before him
[49:33] and mocked him saying hail king of the
[49:34] jews
[49:35] and they spit upon him and took the reed
[49:37] and smote him on the head
[49:39] and after they had mocked him they took
[49:41] the robe off from him
[49:43] and put his own raiment on him and led
[49:45] him away to crucify him
[49:47] and as they came out they found a man of
[49:50] cyrene simon by name
[49:52] him they compelled to bear his cross
[49:56] we're going to go to this may seem a bit
[49:58] um
[50:00] i just prayed the lord all this title
[50:01] together
[50:03] amen and then and then we're here in
[50:05] first samuel 17 from verse 24 this is
[50:08] just another familiar piece of scripture
[50:10] this is where david has
[50:11] come to join the battle and um
[50:15] and all of the men of israel when they
[50:18] saw the mans that was goliath they fled
[50:20] from him and were sore afraid
[50:22] and the men of israel said have you seen
[50:25] this man that has come up
[50:26] surely to defy israel as he come up and
[50:29] it shall be
[50:30] that the uh that the man who killeth him
[50:33] the king will enrich him with great
[50:35] riches and will give him his daughter
[50:37] and make
[50:38] his father's house free in israel and
[50:40] david spoke to the men that stood by him
[50:43] saying
[50:43] what shall be done to the man that
[50:45] killeth this philistine and taketh away
[50:47] their approach from israel
[50:48] for who is this uncircumcised philistine
[50:51] that should defy the armies of the
[50:53] living god
[50:54] and the people answered him after this
[50:56] man are saying it shall be done to the
[50:57] man that killeth him
[50:59] and elia his eldest brother heard when
[51:01] he spake unto the men
[51:03] and elijah's anger was kindled against
[51:06] david and he said
[51:07] why cometh thou down hither and with
[51:10] whom
[51:11] hast thou left those few sheep in the
[51:13] wilderness
[51:14] i know thy pride and the naughtiness of
[51:16] thine heart
[51:17] art thou come down that thou may see for
[51:19] thou come down that thou mayest see the
[51:21] battle
[51:22] and david said what have i now done
[51:25] is there not a cause
[51:29] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[51:31] his word you may have your seats
[51:32] uh this morning and i would like to
[51:35] continue from
[51:36] last sunday speaking about how we are
[51:39] the lord's ambassadors upon the earth
[51:40] and i just want to
[51:42] just throw a question out there is there
[51:44] not a cause you know we have the cause
[51:46] of christ
[51:47] i mean we understand that there are many
[51:48] great there have been many great causes
[51:50] through history
[51:52] there have been many great causes you
[51:53] know of great you know um you know that
[51:55] men have literally given their lives
[51:57] amen for you know and and in doing so
[52:00] they've been great feats of heroism
[52:02] i mean they're the great feats of
[52:03] stories of human survival hardship
[52:05] overcoming great odds sacrifices given
[52:08] amen and and and we know that there are
[52:11] still causes today
[52:12] but i want to speak about the cause
[52:14] which is the cause for christ
[52:16] i mean we know if there is a cause there
[52:17] will be a conflict there'll be a battle
[52:19] and we know if there's a battle there's
[52:20] an enemy to contend with
[52:22] amen and and we must understand that
[52:25] that we have an enemy that we're
[52:26] contending with amen we know that
[52:28] he is a defeated being he has been
[52:30] conquered he was stripped
[52:32] of everything that day on calvary he
[52:34] doesn't have the keys to his own house
[52:36] amen he was he was reminded of this
[52:38] prayer line after prayer line in the
[52:40] prophet's ministry night after night
[52:42] service after service he was reminded
[52:44] satan an angel of god has commissioned
[52:46] me amen to
[52:48] to to cast you out wherever i find you
[52:50] and i'll say this we are commissioned
[52:52] we're under a mandate amen for the cause
[52:54] of christ amen that the devil will be
[52:56] cast out wherever we may find him
[52:59] hallelujah so whether you like it or not
[53:01] you're you're in a cause
[53:03] and you'll you'll adopt some cause in
[53:05] your life
[53:06] i mean there's many different causes
[53:08] many different voices trying to enlist
[53:09] you into their cause
[53:10] but i say i need you in the cause of
[53:12] christ i need you on my side i mean
[53:15] i can't do this alone i won't try and do
[53:17] it alone i need you
[53:18] in my in my army amen hallelujah
[53:22] this may be scattergun but but we'll
[53:24] start somewhere end up somewhere else
[53:26] and
[53:26] you know but we have a cause and i was
[53:28] thinking if this was maybe the last
[53:29] sermon i'd ever stand and i'd deliver to
[53:31] you
[53:32] we have a cause that's worth living for
[53:34] we have a cause that's worth dying for
[53:36] where because it's worth giving our all
[53:38] for hallelujah so we have
[53:41] we have an enemy to fight we must
[53:44] understand that sure he is defeated but
[53:46] he's a slicker
[53:47] you cannot defeat him in your own
[53:49] strength amen you cannot
[53:50] not with your mind not with what you
[53:52] remember not with your affections your
[53:54] conscience imagining imagination
[53:56] reasoning you can't defeat him in your
[53:57] own ability doesn't matter how much
[53:59] self-control you have you cannot defeat
[54:01] him
[54:01] it takes the holy ghost in your life he
[54:04] will defeat him
[54:05] every time and he makes the difference
[54:08] he will make the difference in your job
[54:09] he'll make the difference in your school
[54:11] on the street in your home he makes a
[54:13] difference
[54:14] and we must always remember this that
[54:16] the power of god is greater than the
[54:18] power of the enemy
[54:19] hallelujah greater that is in you that
[54:21] he's in the world
[54:22] we must remember this well i'm going
[54:24] through a real hard point he'll make the
[54:26] difference
[54:27] hallelujah amen
[54:31] brother brown would speak of a man
[54:33] called arnold von winkler
[54:36] let's just let's just put this in here
[54:38] that's the way the devil does it and
[54:39] brother he
[54:40] don't halfway do nothing he pushes
[54:42] everything he's got right into you
[54:46] oh our enemy does not
[54:49] he doesn't believe in no j you know
[54:51] geneva convention
[54:52] how to how to handle prisoners and you
[54:54] know he he has no rules
[54:57] i mean he has no rules he knows he has
[55:00] but a short time
[55:01] he will push everything he can into you
[55:03] and then once he's pushed everything he
[55:04] can he'll keep pushing a little bit more
[55:07] and a little bit more i remember thanks
[55:09] be to god god has got something pushing
[55:11] back that he does that's himself
[55:13] hallelujah that's right amen look at him
[55:15] hallelujah
[55:16] so the devil will push as much as he can
[55:19] he doesn't give you a day off
[55:22] he doesn't take leave he doesn't go on
[55:24] holiday
[55:25] he's a 24 7 devil he has a cause
[55:29] he's committed he's not a part-time
[55:32] devil he's a full-time devil
[55:34] and we cannot defeat a full-time devil
[55:36] being part-time christians
[55:38] amen we cannot be part-time christians
[55:40] what does that mean
[55:41] it's more than just well coming to
[55:42] churching no no a part-time christian is
[55:45] part of time
[55:45] the lord's living in your life by the
[55:47] time you're living yourself
[55:48] that's part time we can't be part-time
[55:51] this word is to be put on flesh
[55:52] every moment of every day hallelujah
[55:57] it's a brother brown with speaker of
[55:58] arnold von winkler and it's amazing when
[56:01] when the first time that he would bring
[56:02] up the story he would he would speak
[56:04] about
[56:05] uh oh here's another one so i don't me
[56:08] and slides you know
[56:08] we're trying to become good friends but
[56:11] and as the devil always does when he
[56:13] thinks he's got the upper hand brother
[56:15] he really
[56:16] pushes it so he had a great big fella
[56:18] there about seven foot or eight foot
[56:20] tall maybe a little more maybe ten feet
[56:22] great big shoulders like a barn big
[56:24] spear and armor this is thing about
[56:25] goliath
[56:27] i mean and he stood out there said now i
[56:28] tell you what now that's what we do i'm
[56:30] the witness over here for the
[56:31] philistines let us
[56:33] have a witness from over there and let
[56:35] the armies not fight but let us come out
[56:37] and fight and if i kill him
[56:38] then you all serve us if he kills me
[56:40] then we'll serve you
[56:42] see how the devil does it when he thinks
[56:44] he's got the upper hand he boasts and
[56:45] brags and carries on
[56:47] and he'll rub himself right in your face
[56:51] amen he will put himself right in front
[56:54] of your face and say you can't do
[56:55] nothing about me here i am
[56:58] but that's not the end of the story we
[57:00] should never put up with the devil
[57:02] you know there's a scripture that you
[57:03] know you know the brotherhood uses about
[57:04] the devil being cast out and you know he
[57:07] you know the devil leaves his his
[57:08] habitation and he walks in dry places he
[57:10] says i'm going to go back to where i'm
[57:12] from
[57:12] you know many times unfortunately people
[57:14] who don't have the holy ghost yo they
[57:15] may be acting normal for a little bit
[57:17] and then the devil just anoints their
[57:18] life and they just go berserk and then
[57:20] they go normal again
[57:21] what's that the devil walks out he goes
[57:24] on a scenic tour
[57:25] and he comes back into what he believes
[57:26] is his house
[57:28] we're not called to have that kind of
[57:29] life we're not called to have that kind
[57:31] of life
[57:31] we're called to have a life where god
[57:33] lives and when the devil comes back
[57:34] there's someone
[57:35] when he tries to open the door there's a
[57:36] strong man standing there saying what
[57:38] are you doing here boy this is my
[57:40] position i purchased this one on calvary
[57:42] this is mine
[57:44] hallelujah amen but he'll push
[57:47] he'll this is how he does it is there
[57:50] not a power in the bride
[57:52] is there not a power in this revealed
[57:54] word to cast out any devil
[57:57] to master every circumstance to overcome
[58:00] everything
[58:01] hallelujah and there's powers right here
[58:03] this morning we're not looking for
[58:04] something to come we've got it
[58:06] hallelujah you know and don't don't
[58:09] don't don't glaze over
[58:10] when i talk about these things the only
[58:13] glaze i ever want to see is on a
[58:14] doughnut
[58:15] or maybe a roast ham that's the only
[58:18] glaze i want to see i don't want to see
[58:19] a glazed look
[58:21] hallelujah you say just just lock right
[58:23] in
[58:24] amen this is the hour of liberty
[58:27] hallelujah we are we are living under a
[58:29] mandate
[58:30] this is the hour of the liberation of
[58:32] the sons and daughters of god
[58:33] not a partial liberation a full
[58:35] liberation i mean this is the hour for
[58:38] it amen the word calls for it
[58:40] and here we are amen we'll get to simon
[58:42] of cyrene
[58:43] at at some point now brother brown would
[58:46] speak of arnold von
[58:48] von winkler and everyone who
[58:51] who knows the story is as there was in
[58:53] switzerland
[58:54] many many years ago when the austrians
[58:57] had had come in to invade the country
[58:59] and the swiss have something about them
[59:01] they like to be independent
[59:03] now this is just a national thing but
[59:05] it's amazing when brother brown would
[59:07] bring the story up he would preach a
[59:08] service
[59:09] called return and jubilee so what he's
[59:12] saying is we need to return to
[59:14] the real pentecost and have a liberation
[59:16] have a jubilee
[59:18] so so this is this is the context that
[59:20] he's bringing the story in and and i
[59:21] thought that was very
[59:22] very interesting why is that interesting
[59:25] because we've gone 50 odd years down the
[59:26] road
[59:27] the books the mighty angels come down
[59:29] with an open book he's given us a title
[59:31] deed but now we must fight for the
[59:33] contents of the document
[59:34] right just like the declaration of
[59:36] independence they they rang the liberty
[59:38] bell
[59:38] they signed that declaration of
[59:39] independence but they had to fight a war
[59:42] and they went through a lot of hardship
[59:43] they had a lot of trouble i mean but
[59:45] they were determined what we put our
[59:47] names to what we put our lives to is
[59:49] will be manifest in this country
[59:51] hallelujah now i'm talking about the
[59:52] united states now but they were
[59:54] determined
[59:54] we're going to have it's not just words
[59:56] on paper
[59:58] this is going to become flesh where
[1:00:00] they're going to have their own
[1:00:01] sovereign nation under heaven
[1:00:02] and if a national just a just a nation
[1:00:05] can be that way
[1:00:06] how much more the bride of christ how
[1:00:08] much were people that haven't just
[1:00:09] that written an earthly document but
[1:00:11] they've received a heavenly document
[1:00:13] amen and the captain of the host is
[1:00:15] jesus and he's present
[1:00:17] to and to ensure that we receive the
[1:00:19] contents of that document
[1:00:21] well what's in that document divine
[1:00:22] healing a rapture our families amen
[1:00:24] salvation the holy ghost
[1:00:26] liberty in christ walking with the lord
[1:00:28] all those things are in the document
[1:00:30] overcoming
[1:00:31] the natural man that that we received at
[1:00:33] our first birth
[1:00:35] i'll say many times we're using a
[1:00:37] complex as an excuse
[1:00:39] many times you know it's amazing people
[1:00:40] build great big temples and shrines to
[1:00:43] gods
[1:00:44] but in reality they're nothing compared
[1:00:45] to what people build in their own hearts
[1:00:47] of complexes and pains and hurts and
[1:00:49] they they make these things so very big
[1:00:52] but really what we need is we need the
[1:00:54] holy ghost
[1:00:55] we need him to come and sweep out our
[1:00:57] temple and take those grottos away and
[1:00:59] those shrines and those things that we
[1:01:01] people will build their lives around
[1:01:02] complexes and hurts and worries
[1:01:05] i don't want to build my life around
[1:01:07] those things i want to build my life
[1:01:08] around the lord jesus
[1:01:10] christ hallelujah there's great temple
[1:01:13] complexes in the world but they're
[1:01:15] nothing compared to how people build
[1:01:16] things in their lives
[1:01:18] so we should never use a complex as an
[1:01:20] excuse or a hurt as an excuse
[1:01:23] if we could have jesus come and stand
[1:01:25] here and testify
[1:01:26] of his earthly journey here he comes
[1:01:30] jesus of nazareth
[1:01:31] he stands behind the pulpit he's going
[1:01:33] to give a testimony
[1:01:34] my childhood was different the kids
[1:01:37] didn't like me
[1:01:39] i want to be in the temple they made fun
[1:01:41] of me
[1:01:42] i was misunderstood they called me bad
[1:01:45] names
[1:01:46] they said that i wasn't joseph you know
[1:01:49] you know they said that you know
[1:01:50] mary slept with a soldier or soldier
[1:01:53] raped her or whatever and here i
[1:01:54] am but i knew who i was but but there
[1:01:58] was a pressure that
[1:01:58] that they tried to put on me when i was
[1:02:01] 12 i'd go to the temple
[1:02:03] and i'd speak to the scribes and
[1:02:04] pharisees in the high priest i wasn't a
[1:02:06] normal kind of kid i knew i was
[1:02:08] different
[1:02:09] i was tempted on every point
[1:02:12] my teenage years were very difficult he
[1:02:15] with me
[1:02:16] he was a man he was the god man but he
[1:02:18] was a man my teenage years were very
[1:02:20] difficult
[1:02:21] i tried somewhere to kind of fit in but
[1:02:23] i didn't i just didn't fit in i knew who
[1:02:25] i was
[1:02:26] i was friendly to him but i was friendly
[1:02:28] to no one at the same time i mean
[1:02:29] friends of all but friends of none
[1:02:32] i was i was acquainted with grief my
[1:02:34] life wasn't a happy life
[1:02:36] now i ask you the question now what's
[1:02:37] your problem what's your if you could
[1:02:40] look at the lord and see what he endured
[1:02:42] he wasn't like this modern film idea
[1:02:45] that they put of jesus or or the kid's
[1:02:47] cartoon he's like some hippie jesus that
[1:02:49] walks around and everything's just
[1:02:50] lovely
[1:02:51] the scripture says he was acquainted
[1:02:52] with grief if you're acquainted with
[1:02:54] grief you know it real well
[1:02:56] it's not just a one-off kind of
[1:02:58] interaction no no you you build a
[1:03:00] relationship
[1:03:01] and this was the kind of life he lived
[1:03:03] and he came to his own his own received
[1:03:05] him not
[1:03:06] think about it for a second this is this
[1:03:09] is the kind of
[1:03:10] walk that he had i gathered many people
[1:03:13] to myself
[1:03:14] i was betrayed by my inner circle
[1:03:17] who's been betrayed who's been made fun
[1:03:21] of
[1:03:21] who's been rejected when i would finally
[1:03:24] end up on the cross
[1:03:27] i died of a broken heart but that was
[1:03:29] the end of my journey
[1:03:32] i had to carry the sins of the world
[1:03:35] upon my shoulders
[1:03:36] not just one man's sins i died a sinner
[1:03:40] my last cry was my god my god why is
[1:03:42] that forsaken me this is the spot that i
[1:03:44] got to in my walk
[1:03:46] and not only that i went down to hell
[1:03:48] and preached the souls in prison
[1:03:51] and we think we had a bad day we think
[1:03:53] we had a bad decade
[1:03:55] if he lived that kind of life did it
[1:03:58] up his walk
[1:03:59] no amen did it leave him a bitter
[1:04:03] twisted angry man
[1:04:04] oh no amen when he would hang on the
[1:04:07] cross between heavens and earth and say
[1:04:08] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:04:10] they do
[1:04:10] that wasn't just a word that he said out
[1:04:12] of his mind that was his heart's cry
[1:04:14] they don't know what they're doing and
[1:04:16] we must understand they planned the
[1:04:17] whole thing
[1:04:18] right you could stand the natural mind
[1:04:21] they knew what they were doing
[1:04:22] they had meetings they had they had zoom
[1:04:25] meetings maybe
[1:04:28] they sent emails how can we destroy this
[1:04:30] man
[1:04:31] they planned it but when he looked down
[1:04:33] at them he said father forgive them they
[1:04:35] don't know what they do
[1:04:38] he wasn't he could have been
[1:04:41] he wasn't bitter he could have been
[1:04:45] he walked with god he fulfilled the word
[1:04:48] for his life
[1:04:50] there's many parts of the scripture that
[1:04:51] we would not want to fulfill
[1:04:54] one of the prophets would walk naked
[1:04:55] through the streets
[1:04:57] one would take a harlot marry her one
[1:04:59] would you know be on his side
[1:05:01] so many days and so many you know on his
[1:05:03] other side so many days
[1:05:05] you know they had to do incredible
[1:05:06] things but yet they were surrendered
[1:05:09] to the word of god for their life how
[1:05:11] about you and i
[1:05:13] and we open the fridge and there's no
[1:05:15] food and we think we're having a bad
[1:05:16] time
[1:05:19] kind of puts it in perspective that's
[1:05:21] the kind of testimony he would give
[1:05:24] sure he'd talk about lazarus being
[1:05:25] raised sure he'd talk about this
[1:05:27] wind and the waves and the you know but
[1:05:28] we always love to talk about the great
[1:05:30] things
[1:05:31] but what about the other bits that
[1:05:32] aren't so glamorous
[1:05:34] it's all part of it it's not it's not a
[1:05:37] one-sided
[1:05:39] streak
[1:05:42] so brother and would speak about arnold
[1:05:44] von winkler
[1:05:46] and the swiss had been invaded by the
[1:05:48] austrians
[1:05:51] and they they decided that they were
[1:05:54] going to make a stand
[1:05:55] because they wanted liberty they wanted
[1:05:58] liberty they had a cause
[1:06:00] some causes are very good some causes
[1:06:02] are not so good but they had a cause
[1:06:03] isn't that a good cause
[1:06:04] i want to live in my free land i don't
[1:06:06] want some foreign power coming in and
[1:06:08] taking over
[1:06:09] i want to live in my free land and so
[1:06:12] but the austrians had
[1:06:13] had far greater weapons they had far
[1:06:15] greater you know armies
[1:06:17] these people were just farmers but they
[1:06:19] made up their mind
[1:06:20] they are not gonna just let this enemy
[1:06:22] trample over our lives
[1:06:24] we should have that same kind of
[1:06:25] attitude towards the devil
[1:06:27] we're not gonna let him come in here set
[1:06:29] up shop do what he wants to do
[1:06:30] no there must be a cry of liberty we
[1:06:33] have a cause
[1:06:34] amen so he says right out from behind
[1:06:36] that table she went in the middle of the
[1:06:38] floor
[1:06:38] the hat took off and the cop took off
[1:06:40] his hat and all the rest of them and we
[1:06:42] had an old-fashioned prayer meeting
[1:06:43] there
[1:06:44] and she was liberated and brought back
[1:06:46] to christ it's a jubilee friends the
[1:06:48] jubilee's on
[1:06:49] it's time for men and women to come back
[1:06:51] to christ
[1:06:52] amen here not long ago in switzerland
[1:06:54] standing up there in the big high
[1:06:56] uh elk mountains i was thinking of
[1:06:58] arnold von winkler
[1:06:59] many of you know the story what a
[1:07:01] gallant hero he was many years ago in
[1:07:03] switzerland how that the
[1:07:05] swiss nation had been invaded by mighty
[1:07:07] army and the cities were being taken
[1:07:09] and the gallant blood of the swiss
[1:07:11] people were
[1:07:13] sorry and the gallon blood of the swiss
[1:07:15] people congregated
[1:07:17] into the mountains into a valley with
[1:07:18] such little weapons
[1:07:20] as they could defend themselves with and
[1:07:22] when they stood there on the field
[1:07:24] they looked approaching them and when
[1:07:26] they were approaching this great army
[1:07:28] they were outnumbered 50 to one
[1:07:30] and they wasn't soldiers they wasn't
[1:07:32] trained they didn't know what to do but
[1:07:33] this army had that was invading
[1:07:35] was well trained every man was like a
[1:07:38] brick wall coming right in
[1:07:40] the devil's well trained he's had six
[1:07:43] thousand
[1:07:43] nearly six thousand years however long
[1:07:45] to train he knows what it's like to take
[1:07:47] a human life and try and destroy it
[1:07:49] he knows what it's like to try and take
[1:07:50] a family and rip it apart he's done it
[1:07:52] before
[1:07:53] but there's got to come a time where it
[1:07:54] stops there's got to come a time where
[1:07:57] it stops and now is the time where it
[1:07:59] stops
[1:08:00] hallelujah amen and when they were
[1:08:03] standing there with their spares moving
[1:08:05] up one
[1:08:06] great man stepped out arnold van von
[1:08:08] winkler as he stepped out there in the
[1:08:10] presence they were hopeless
[1:08:12] everything they could think of was lost
[1:08:14] it was simply
[1:08:15] uh they would simply have to go down
[1:08:17] with their homes be lost their families
[1:08:18] would be killed the fatherlands would be
[1:08:20] destroyed
[1:08:20] there was nothing they could do it was
[1:08:22] hopeless
[1:08:24] then arnold von winkler stepped out and
[1:08:26] said swiss brethren this day i'll give
[1:08:27] my life to switzerland
[1:08:28] and the homelands he said what will you
[1:08:30] do said down in the valley yonder is a
[1:08:33] lovely little home
[1:08:34] where my wife and little children are
[1:08:35] waiting for me to come back but they'll
[1:08:37] never see me again
[1:08:38] from this day shall be my life for this
[1:08:41] day shall i give my life for my country
[1:08:43] and as he said that they said what will
[1:08:44] he do he said now everyone
[1:08:46] that's got weapons follow me and do the
[1:08:48] best you can fight with what you got
[1:08:51] i mean do everything you can with what
[1:08:53] well with what you have
[1:08:55] got to do with fight with what you got
[1:08:58] oh i don't have enough faith take that
[1:09:00] faith and start fighting
[1:09:01] hallelujah i don't have enough
[1:09:03] revelation take the revelation you have
[1:09:04] and start fighting hallelujah
[1:09:08] and he screamed threw up his weapons he
[1:09:09] said make way for liberty
[1:09:11] and he started towards that arm and he
[1:09:12] went right towards the thickest of the
[1:09:14] spears
[1:09:15] and when he got right down to where
[1:09:16] there was a hundred gleaming spares to
[1:09:18] catch him as he came
[1:09:19] he threw up his hand and said make way
[1:09:20] for liberty and he grabbed big handfuls
[1:09:22] of those spares and threw them into his
[1:09:24] chest
[1:09:24] and each one of those swiss soldiers
[1:09:26] followed right behind him he broke the
[1:09:28] ranks of the enemy and they won a
[1:09:29] victory like there never was one
[1:09:32] before and today you can mention his
[1:09:34] name in switzerland and their um
[1:09:37] eyes with color with tears and their
[1:09:38] cheeks will flush it
[1:09:40] to the hero that was one of the greatest
[1:09:41] heroes to my opinion
[1:09:43] that's been in the army life but that's
[1:09:44] just a minor thing
[1:09:46] just a minor thing one day the sons of
[1:09:48] adam were standing defeated laws and
[1:09:49] prophets and everything had failed
[1:09:51] every approach we had made had totally
[1:09:54] failed
[1:09:54] and yonder and glory there was one
[1:09:56] stepped out called the son of god
[1:09:58] and the angel said what will you do he
[1:10:00] says i'll go down and give my life
[1:10:02] and this day i'll redeem the fallen sons
[1:10:04] of adam
[1:10:05] hallelujah and he came to calvary and he
[1:10:07] went to the thickest of the spears and
[1:10:09] he went through the valley of the shadow
[1:10:10] of death
[1:10:11] caught every dart of the devil pulled
[1:10:12] into his own bosom and called for the
[1:10:14] church to take what you've got and do
[1:10:16] the best you can
[1:10:18] highly praise god in the day of
[1:10:19] pentecost a rushing mighty wind
[1:10:21] fell out of the heavens above and armed
[1:10:23] every man with a weapon
[1:10:24] and i say today my brethren that every
[1:10:26] man whatever you've got let's do the
[1:10:28] best we can with what we got
[1:10:29] and fight to the last man because we've
[1:10:31] got the enemy's lines broke
[1:10:33] christ defeated satan stripped him of
[1:10:35] everything he ever had and he's nothing
[1:10:36] today but a bluff
[1:10:38] but he tells you you can't have another
[1:10:40] old-fashioned holy ghost outpouring of
[1:10:42] the spirit
[1:10:42] you can have it today because the lines
[1:10:44] of the enemy is broke
[1:10:46] and god rules and reigns today
[1:10:47] hallelujah i'm glad for an old-fashioned
[1:10:49] holy ghost experience of the living god
[1:10:52] amen hallelujah oh he doesn't do that
[1:10:53] today yes he does
[1:10:55] he doesn't pour himself out today oh yes
[1:10:57] he does
[1:10:59] hallelujah amen there's a there's a
[1:11:02] painting of what he did he took those
[1:11:03] spears
[1:11:04] pulled them into himself made a breach
[1:11:07] in the lines
[1:11:08] and they won the day that's a minor
[1:11:11] thing brother branham said great heroics
[1:11:12] great causes
[1:11:14] but we have a greater cause than that we
[1:11:16] have a far greater course than that
[1:11:18] not just for a national you know a
[1:11:20] nation to be preserved amen we've got a
[1:11:22] we got a heavenly calling
[1:11:24] hallelujah but i'll say this the reason
[1:11:26] they could rally around arnold von
[1:11:28] winklers they knew they were swiss
[1:11:30] right they knew where they were from
[1:11:31] they knew their land they knew their
[1:11:33] culture they knew their language
[1:11:34] they knew where they were from that's
[1:11:35] why they could rally together
[1:11:37] i say friends we're not here to contend
[1:11:39] for a nation we're not here to contend
[1:11:41] even for this world
[1:11:42] we're here to contend for the sons and
[1:11:44] daughters of god amen that they would go
[1:11:46] free
[1:11:47] as the prophet told us let's find the
[1:11:49] last one that we can go
[1:11:51] home amen hallelujah but the reason they
[1:11:55] could rally is they knew who they were
[1:11:57] and we were we can look one another in
[1:11:59] the eye and we can see the word in flesh
[1:12:01] we can see a part of heaven literally in
[1:12:03] a body
[1:12:04] hallelujah i mean and we speak the same
[1:12:07] language
[1:12:08] we speak a heavenly language how do we
[1:12:11] fight for the same things
[1:12:12] we're not against one another we're not
[1:12:13] divided we're united
[1:12:16] hallelujah amen
[1:12:20] jude would tell the right to the
[1:12:21] believers there beloved
[1:12:24] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[1:12:26] you of the common salvation
[1:12:27] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:12:29] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[1:12:31] contend
[1:12:32] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:12:34] to the saints this is what he's this is
[1:12:36] the last letter written
[1:12:37] and then of course there's the book of
[1:12:38] revelation but this is the last epistles
[1:12:40] yeah that's written he said you must
[1:12:42] earnestly not casually
[1:12:44] not lazily not when you feel like it you
[1:12:47] know
[1:12:48] many times i don't feel like walking
[1:12:49] into this building i'll be honest
[1:12:51] i'd rather be in i'd rather be asleep
[1:12:54] but there's something in me
[1:12:56] i want to i want to show the devil whose
[1:12:57] side i am on
[1:12:59] i want to show them devil i'm on the
[1:13:01] lord's side i'm coming into the house of
[1:13:03] the lord whether i feel like it or not
[1:13:04] whether it's convenient or not i'm going
[1:13:06] to worship god
[1:13:07] hardly because he gave his whole life
[1:13:09] for me i mean out of appreciation i'm
[1:13:11] just going to pour it all out for him
[1:13:14] hallelujah i'm having a bad day who
[1:13:16] cares i'm having a bad week don't worry
[1:13:19] about it i'm having a bad year don't
[1:13:20] worry about that either
[1:13:21] amen hallelujah i'd just come and praise
[1:13:24] god
[1:13:25] hallelujah because remember we don't
[1:13:27] worship god because of our situation
[1:13:29] we're not on hallelujah highway because
[1:13:31] we're because of our situation
[1:13:33] we worship him because of who he is and
[1:13:35] what he has done
[1:13:36] i mean not because of what we may be
[1:13:38] going through because of who he is
[1:13:40] isn't that right that's why we raise our
[1:13:42] hands that's why we worship god
[1:13:44] it's because of who he is not because of
[1:13:47] your circumstances
[1:13:49] hallelujah that's why david could say
[1:13:51] that that he prepares the table before
[1:13:53] me in the presence of my enemies
[1:13:56] hallelujah that sounds like a strange
[1:13:59] strange place to eat a feast oh no but
[1:14:01] if you're under the king's banner
[1:14:03] you can be rejoicing in the mess of the
[1:14:05] devil amen
[1:14:07] god actually prepares a table he says
[1:14:09] satan look at my bride she's gonna feast
[1:14:11] she's gonna feast in your presence she's
[1:14:13] going to enjoy she's going to worship
[1:14:15] she's going to praise god
[1:14:16] hallelujah the devil thinks it can't be
[1:14:20] done but we're living it out
[1:14:22] hallelujah so we're here to earnestly
[1:14:24] contend for the faith once delivered to
[1:14:25] the saints
[1:14:27] amen this is our cause
[1:14:31] is it not we've got a noble cause the
[1:14:34] noble scores on the earth
[1:14:35] there's many great causes but this is
[1:14:37] the cause
[1:14:40] hallelujah
[1:14:44] no man can serve two masters for either
[1:14:46] he will hate one and love the other
[1:14:48] or else he'll hold to the one and
[1:14:49] despise the other you cannot serve god
[1:14:52] and mammon
[1:14:53] you can we can only have one master we
[1:14:56] can't have two
[1:14:57] we can't have two we have one i mean so
[1:15:01] let's have the right one
[1:15:02] amen what's the pay in listening into
[1:15:05] the army of the king

[1:15:41] that's the best that's the best company
[1:15:42] vehicle hallelujah and it never needs a
[1:15:45] rejo

[1:15:51] technology this is the best one
[1:15:54] hallelujah what kind of security package
[1:15:57] do i have well
[1:15:59] you know you have more authority with
[1:16:01] god than the archangels of heaven
[1:16:03] you may have been a christian five
[1:16:05] seconds you've got more authority with
[1:16:06] god than the archangels in heaven
[1:16:08] i mean they may be talking to him but
[1:16:09] when one of the redeemed sons and
[1:16:11] daughters of god
[1:16:12] begin to talk to our father which is in
[1:16:15] heaven
[1:16:16] he says hold on gabriel hold on wormwood
[1:16:20] my children are talking hallelujah
[1:16:24] don't get glazed now donuts
[1:16:28] or ham okay
[1:16:32] anyway chocolate if you're wondering
[1:16:35] with the doughnut i don't know about the
[1:16:36] ham
[1:16:38] we can't serve two masters we have the
[1:16:40] best cause in the world
[1:16:43] for he must reign till he hath put all
[1:16:46] enemies under his feet
[1:16:48] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[1:16:49] is death for he hath put all things
[1:16:52] under his feet but when uh he saith all
[1:16:54] things were put under him
[1:16:56] it is manifest that he is expected till
[1:16:59] uh which did sorry it's kind of crop
[1:17:02] i can't see all the words there it is
[1:17:04] manifest that he is expected which did
[1:17:06] put all things under him
[1:17:08] so the last enemy that will be just
[1:17:10] defeated is death
[1:17:12] this is why we're upon the earth you
[1:17:14] know this is why you're here
[1:17:15] we're not here to serve through a dark
[1:17:17] age we're not even here to serve in the
[1:17:19] early church
[1:17:20] we're here to serve that there will be a
[1:17:22] people which are alive and remain
[1:17:24] amen that will not taste death but will
[1:17:27] be changed in a moment and a twinkling
[1:17:29] of an eye
[1:17:30] and this is why this message has come i
[1:17:32] mean to transform your body
[1:17:34] i mean as as melchizedek would go and
[1:17:37] speak to abraham
[1:17:38] and those words and that visitation
[1:17:40] literally changed their bodies
[1:17:42] i mean to be young people again that
[1:17:44] they could receive the promise
[1:17:45] i mean that same melchizedek is in the
[1:17:47] earth now i mean calling the bride to
[1:17:50] himself and the words that have been
[1:17:52] spoken through the mouth of the prophet
[1:17:54] will change your body hallelujah that's
[1:17:56] a good cause isn't it amen
[1:17:59] and we'll do it hallelujah
[1:18:02] amen
[1:18:05] but now we must stay true to our cause
[1:18:12] hey simon simon of cyrene
[1:18:15] we read in the scripture that he was
[1:18:17] compelled
[1:18:19] he was not there in the earliest part of
[1:18:21] the lord jesus ministry
[1:18:23] i don't know what he was doing when the
[1:18:25] thousands were fed in this
[1:18:27] you know seas were calmed whatever i
[1:18:29] don't know what he was doing
[1:18:31] but this was his time the earliest part
[1:18:34] of the ministry of christ had been
[1:18:35] fulfilled
[1:18:36] and he was now taking his last few
[1:18:39] earthly steps
[1:18:40] to the cross what has this got to do
[1:18:43] with you and i
[1:18:45] we've had seven church ages this is the
[1:18:48] literally the last few steps that christ
[1:18:50] will have in a body upon the earth
[1:18:52] before the rapture
[1:18:53] is you and i he's the son of man has
[1:18:56] been walking
[1:18:57] he's walked through this age oh that was
[1:18:59] in the prophet's ministry no no it's
[1:19:00] still now
[1:19:01] because the son of man is revealed in a
[1:19:02] body not just in one but in a body
[1:19:05] so as the son of man walked through the
[1:19:07] prophet's ministry he's still walking
[1:19:08] today through a bride upon the earth
[1:19:11] but now he's come to the last few steps
[1:19:14] before the translation of the saints
[1:19:18] and here is simon i don't know where he
[1:19:21] was in the crowd
[1:19:23] maybe he maybe his interest just got
[1:19:25] attracted because there's a lot of
[1:19:27] a lot of commotion going on in those
[1:19:29] days maybe he was there when everyone
[1:19:32] cut down the palm trees and put their
[1:19:33] garments in the way as the lord jesus
[1:19:35] rode on the donkey into
[1:19:37] into jerusalem i don't know but he was
[1:19:40] attracted
[1:19:40] maybe he was just interested i wonder
[1:19:42] what's going on here
[1:19:44] and and he would see the lord and and
[1:19:46] and maybe barabbas up there
[1:19:48] pilate would say who should i release to
[1:19:50] you
[1:19:51] and pilate was thinking surely they'll
[1:19:53] ask the jesus of nazareth
[1:19:55] then they cry out barabbas give us
[1:19:57] barabbas
[1:19:59] and then brabus is freed and then now
[1:20:02] here comes the lord jesus
[1:20:04] two thieves are behind them and now here
[1:20:06] comes the king of glory
[1:20:08] taking his cross and now in reality
[1:20:11] he was far more mad than this man he was
[1:20:14] mad more than any man
[1:20:16] and brother brown would say um um um
[1:20:18] would dramatize he'd say as his robe
[1:20:20] you'd see spots of blood would start to
[1:20:22] come through his robe
[1:20:23] and then it'll become one big mass of
[1:20:25] blood and so as he's carrying the cross
[1:20:28] now the blood is going on to the cross
[1:20:30] then he falls under the weight of it
[1:20:34] and there he stops the roman soldiers
[1:20:37] picked someone out from the crowd
[1:20:40] you know i wasn't looking
[1:20:44] i wasn't looking for jesus i wasn't
[1:20:47] looking for a rapture
[1:20:48] i wasn't looking to be part of the bride
[1:20:50] of christ i wasn't looking
[1:20:52] but something compelled me something
[1:20:55] compelled me
[1:20:56] you must be part of this ministry you
[1:20:58] must actively pick up the cross
[1:21:01] and you must help him you say well he
[1:21:04] doesn't need help but he needs a people
[1:21:06] to walk through
[1:21:07] he needs a people to finish his earthly
[1:21:09] journey in because
[1:21:10] he has no hands but yours no feet but
[1:21:12] yours no eyes but yours no mouth but
[1:21:14] yours no tongue but yours no heart but
[1:21:16] yours
[1:21:16] upon the earth are you with me
[1:21:20] so here he is the roman soldiers call
[1:21:22] him out
[1:21:23] pick up this man's cross and he's a man
[1:21:26] with a crowd of thorns on his head
[1:21:27] groaning under the weight of that cross
[1:21:29] bleeding
[1:21:31] mud more than any man now it's one thing
[1:21:35] to see that
[1:21:36] another thing to pick it up one thing to
[1:21:39] see the word
[1:21:39] another thing to pick it up one thing to
[1:21:41] see him manifesting but what about in
[1:21:43] you
[1:21:44] what about a new what about the word
[1:21:46] putting on flesh and you that's two
[1:21:48] different things
[1:21:48] it's one thing to see people stand up
[1:21:50] and give testimony in the spirit to fall
[1:21:52] on someone else and they rejoice
[1:21:53] and they get transformed but what about
[1:21:55] you what about you and i hallelujah
[1:21:58] so here he is he's told he's compelled
[1:22:01] you know the last
[1:22:02] call that went out to the wedding supper
[1:22:04] compel them
[1:22:06] get the good get the bad go to the
[1:22:09] highways the byways the rejected ones go
[1:22:11] to them
[1:22:12] compel them and maybe just the spirit of
[1:22:15] god's compelling today
[1:22:18] don't just be a spectator get on the
[1:22:20] field
[1:22:21] get on the field remember there's great
[1:22:23] memorials written to great heroes of
[1:22:25] you know of the world but those things
[1:22:27] will pass away amen but those things
[1:22:29] that are done for christ will last
[1:22:31] hallelujah god's looking for heroes
[1:22:33] today he's not looking for cows he's
[1:22:35] looking for heroes
[1:22:36] well i'm afraid take the weapon you have
[1:22:38] and go with what you have
[1:22:40] hallelujah says simon he's told he's got
[1:22:43] to pick up the cross
[1:22:45] i pray god just make this rule live real
[1:22:47] good right now in everyone's life
[1:22:48] and he picks that up and now he's under
[1:22:51] the way to the cross and now the blood
[1:22:52] that was in jesus that was on the cross
[1:22:54] is now on him
[1:22:56] and now he's he's he's identified with
[1:22:58] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:23:00] he can't put it down and go hide in the
[1:23:02] crowd imagine if he tried to do that he
[1:23:04] tries to hide in the crowd maybe he
[1:23:05] looks like everyone else
[1:23:06] but there's blood on him there's blood
[1:23:09] on him he's not clean no more
[1:23:11] it's actually got a hold of him there's
[1:23:13] blood on him hallelujah it's the same
[1:23:14] thing with you and i
[1:23:15] once the blood falls on you you can't
[1:23:17] hide and you won't want to hide
[1:23:20] hallelujah so he picks up the cross
[1:23:23] and he carries it to golgotha that the
[1:23:26] earthly ministry of jesus christ our
[1:23:28] lord would be fulfilled
[1:23:32] what about today amen is someone willing
[1:23:36] someone willing say lord i'll pick this
[1:23:38] word up yes
[1:23:40] all of its shame all of its glory all of
[1:23:43] its misunderstandings whatever people
[1:23:44] say but i don't care i'll pick it up
[1:23:46] i'll take this revealed word
[1:23:48] i'll let it i'll let it cover me as the
[1:23:51] blood of jesus came on simon he was a
[1:23:53] gentile by the way
[1:23:54] a gentile help the lord jesus to finish
[1:23:58] his earthly ministry
[1:24:00] and here we are today is everyone
[1:24:02] following what i'm saying
[1:24:04] god is looking for people to be part of
[1:24:07] his work
[1:24:08] oh god will get it done but he needs
[1:24:10] people on the earth to be available
[1:24:12] that's right maybe switzerland would
[1:24:14] have been made free but arnold von
[1:24:16] winkler i'd step into the breach
[1:24:19] or someone else would do it but god
[1:24:20] needs you or someone else will do it no
[1:24:23] god needs you
[1:24:24] he needs you and i or someone smarter
[1:24:26] will do it no no god wants you
[1:24:28] someone who can speak better no god
[1:24:30] wants you someone more maybe who can
[1:24:32] sing better god wants you
[1:24:33] amen hallelujah well i can't sing i
[1:24:36] can't preach i can't do nothing i'll
[1:24:37] tell you in the time of joshua
[1:24:39] the elders that outlive joshua their
[1:24:42] presence
[1:24:43] them just being alive kept israel on the
[1:24:46] straight and narrow
[1:24:47] it says after joshua died and the elders
[1:24:49] then they went into idolatry
[1:24:51] so there can be people in our midst it's
[1:24:53] just them living
[1:24:55] just the life they live they don't
[1:24:57] preach they don't sing they don't do a
[1:24:58] lot but just their presence in the
[1:25:00] church
[1:25:01] can keep a church in the word
[1:25:04] that's powerful that's real powerful
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:10] hallelujah
[1:25:14] we don't want to have any excuses
[1:25:17] there's no excuse i can't speak i can't
[1:25:21] do this i can't do this i can't do this
[1:25:22] moses tried to give those in front of
[1:25:23] the lord
[1:25:24] and the lord said no no no he just got
[1:25:26] angry come on i've commissioned you for
[1:25:28] the job
[1:25:29] simon was built to carry the cross he
[1:25:32] was built
[1:25:34] i don't know what his whole life was
[1:25:35] before this but he was made for this
[1:25:37] moment
[1:25:38] and the same thing with you and i we are
[1:25:40] made you say well
[1:25:42] soon it's going to be a rapture
[1:25:43] absolutely but there has to be there has
[1:25:46] to be
[1:25:46] people on the earth that carry this word
[1:25:48] from this point to that point
[1:25:50] and up into glory hallelujah
[1:25:56] he did it i pray we do it too
[1:26:02] but there are some that maybe gone the
[1:26:05] negative a little bit
[1:26:07] there are some that forget their cause
[1:26:14] samson was a great man
[1:26:17] he was raised up to defeat the nation
[1:26:20] that was oppressing israel
[1:26:22] that was his cause but somehow
[1:26:25] he found himself in a dungeon
[1:26:29] with his eyes out grinding meal for the
[1:26:32] philistines
[1:26:33] he didn't start off that way he ended up
[1:26:35] that way
[1:26:37] and the world delilah loved him
[1:26:41] and wooed him and vexed his spirit
[1:26:45] and kept asking him and manipulated him
[1:26:48] until finally he revealed the source of
[1:26:50] his strength
[1:26:52] and that same spirit is in the earth
[1:26:55] wooing us
[1:26:56] oh i love you you're so welcome here
[1:27:00] this is where you fit oh you're so good
[1:27:02] at this and that and whatever more
[1:27:04] tries to wore us away and if we're not
[1:27:07] careful it'll put our eyes out
[1:27:10] that we cannot see the promises of god
[1:27:12] for our day
[1:27:13] it'll literally put our eyes out other
[1:27:15] world's harmless i can be fine it'll put
[1:27:17] your eyes out
[1:27:18] it will blind you and all you'll be
[1:27:20] doing is going working for the devil
[1:27:22] going around
[1:27:23] and around and around
[1:27:26] you say that's pretty hard that's true
[1:27:28] that's what happened to him oh but we're
[1:27:30] in this
[1:27:31] but but we're living after calvary it's
[1:27:34] different now is it
[1:27:35] what happened down through the church
[1:27:37] ages there's been a cycle of revival
[1:27:40] and death and that cycle of revival and
[1:27:42] death brotherhood says has never failed
[1:27:45] oh but i'm in the message there'll be
[1:27:47] people in this message
[1:27:48] that come with great enthusiasm
[1:27:52] and then they become formal and
[1:27:54] powerless
[1:27:55] and cold and they go down to death
[1:27:58] but there will be a people that come in
[1:28:01] under the word hallelujah and they know
[1:28:04] what their cause is they know why
[1:28:05] they're here
[1:28:06] and they don't go into that cycle but
[1:28:08] that cycle is broken in their lives
[1:28:10] and they just are walking in revival
[1:28:14] i believe i'm looking at those kind of
[1:28:16] people amen
[1:28:18] yes sir but samson
[1:28:21] he did incredible things what a hero
[1:28:24] takes up a new
[1:28:25] jawbone of an ass and kills a thousand
[1:28:26] men takes the gates of gaza and carries
[1:28:29] them on his shoulders
[1:28:30] their big gates takes a line and just
[1:28:33] literally rips it in two
[1:28:35] hallelujah the philistines were
[1:28:37] terrified of that kind of man
[1:28:39] the his name just being mentioned made
[1:28:41] made soldiers maybe to wet their pants
[1:28:43] and run for their lives
[1:28:45] but now it was different he had allowed
[1:28:49] delilah to take his strength from him
[1:28:54] many people said the devil's on my case
[1:28:57] where did you open a door where did you
[1:29:00] open a door
[1:29:01] samson opened a door and he found
[1:29:04] himself blinded
[1:29:06] at the mill but all that time
[1:29:11] all that time his hair was growing back
[1:29:14] his hair was growing back you may feel
[1:29:17] like you've been stripped
[1:29:19] the devil's just got you as a laughing
[1:29:20] stock but all that all this time
[1:29:23] you must never remember but you must
[1:29:25] never forget rather
[1:29:27] the reason you're upon the earth amen
[1:29:29] amen it's to defeat
[1:29:31] death i mean that sin will not have
[1:29:33] dominion in our lives or our families
[1:29:36] not
[1:29:36] lives but we'll walk out of this world
[1:29:38] victorious this is the cause that we
[1:29:40] live for
[1:29:43] we'll come back to that later
[1:29:47] now and we'll come back to samson now
[1:29:50] jesus would speak
[1:29:51] in matthew 24 he says therefore be
[1:29:54] also ready for such an hour you think uh
[1:29:57] not when the son of man cometh who then
[1:30:01] is a faithful and wise
[1:30:02] servant when whom his lord hath made
[1:30:04] rule over his household
[1:30:06] to give them meat and due season blesses
[1:30:08] that servant whom his lord when he
[1:30:10] cometh shall
[1:30:11] find so doing amen how do you want the
[1:30:14] lord to find you doing
[1:30:16] living for him barely i say to you that
[1:30:20] he shall make him ruler of all of his
[1:30:22] goods
[1:30:22] but if that evil servant shall say in
[1:30:24] his heart my lord delayeth
[1:30:27] his coming no one will say that
[1:30:31] but people's actions say that because
[1:30:34] they find
[1:30:34] other things more important than the
[1:30:36] coming of the lord sure we have families
[1:30:38] we have children we have jobs we have
[1:30:39] houses we
[1:30:40] we have all those things but what's the
[1:30:43] what's the principal theme of your life
[1:30:45] what's the main thing that's that's
[1:30:48] that's motivating you
[1:30:49] amen it should be the coming of the lord
[1:30:52] so this so
[1:30:52] see the lord the laith is coming and
[1:30:54] there appears to have been a delay
[1:30:57] right that's because there's more names
[1:30:59] in the book that must
[1:31:00] be dipped in the blood amen and beget
[1:31:04] and he shall and shall begin to smite
[1:31:06] his fellow servants
[1:31:08] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[1:31:11] well we're not going to become a bunch
[1:31:12] of alcoholics but there's another
[1:31:14] there's another spirit you can drink in
[1:31:17] remember book of revelation it says the
[1:31:20] world the kings the earth will be made
[1:31:21] drunk
[1:31:22] with the wine or the wrath of her
[1:31:24] fornication so people can become
[1:31:26] drunk because they say well i've got a
[1:31:30] long time he'll come
[1:31:31] he's delaying his coming they lose their
[1:31:34] focus their cause
[1:31:36] and they begin to smite their fellow
[1:31:38] servants how do you smite fellow
[1:31:40] servants
[1:31:41] your brother so and so did this sister
[1:31:43] did this and talk
[1:31:44] talk about people in a way that will
[1:31:45] actually de-christianize them
[1:31:48] that's how you smile it's not physically
[1:31:50] beating people you can actually
[1:31:52] smite people by just how you talk about
[1:31:53] them
[1:31:57] and eat and drink with the drunkard this
[1:31:58] world is drunk
[1:32:00] this world is literally teetering on its
[1:32:02] feet
[1:32:03] on the way to the battle of armageddon
[1:32:06] the whole world is reeling under the
[1:32:07] impact of the spirit
[1:32:09] amen of the devil so they begin to eat
[1:32:12] with the drunken what's happening they
[1:32:14] actually begin to drink in what they're
[1:32:16] feeding on
[1:32:19] the lord of that servant shall come in a
[1:32:21] day when he looketh not for him and for
[1:32:23] an hour that he is not aware of are
[1:32:26] there so many things i've got to do
[1:32:27] i've got a schedule god's got a schedule

[1:33:09] those things but i'm busy doing what i'm
[1:33:11] doing
[1:33:12] now i don't want to be too busy with my
[1:33:14] schedule when the lord says okay this is
[1:33:16] now the time
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:19] and he shall cut him asunder and appoint
[1:33:21] him his portion with the hypocrites
[1:33:23] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[1:33:25] teeth
[1:33:27] we don't want to become drunk with this
[1:33:28] world just because everyone else is
[1:33:30] doing it
[1:33:31] everyone else didn't get in the noah's
[1:33:33] ark either how'd that work out for them
[1:33:35] and this whole world is drunk
[1:33:37] you know the first time trump got
[1:33:38] inaugurated i i
[1:33:40] for some reason live streamed part of
[1:33:42] his inauguration ceremony
[1:33:44] and there's a bit where they go from
[1:33:45] some place i think to the white house he
[1:33:47] gets sworn in
[1:33:48] and and some i just caught the bit where
[1:33:51] he's driving his motorcade from one
[1:33:52] place to another and in this part where
[1:33:54] he gets out he walks along the parade
[1:33:57] and i just watched that and i thought
[1:33:58] this world is drunk
[1:34:01] this world is crazy oh we're going to do
[1:34:04] something about it no we've got a
[1:34:05] different course
[1:34:06] we've got a different course amen
[1:34:10] you know but this this this world has
[1:34:12] gone crazy
[1:34:14] we don't want to be drunk with this
[1:34:16] world
[1:34:19] but remember samson this is where i've
[1:34:22] been listening in in
[1:34:23] 1963 you know i'm just listening through
[1:34:25] this is where i found myself this week
[1:34:28] so here he was samson the mighty
[1:34:31] deliverer of israel
[1:34:34] he was blinded the world blinded him
[1:34:36] don't let the world blind you
[1:34:38] i'm not talking about 20 20 20 vision
[1:34:40] i'm talking about spiritual vision
[1:34:42] don't let the world put your eyes out
[1:34:46] here he was but look at him now blinded
[1:34:48] mocked and just a sport for the enemy
[1:34:50] all of his powers that he once had for
[1:34:52] his protection
[1:34:54] for god's achievement that he had been
[1:34:56] born in the world to do had been
[1:34:57] stripped from him by a woman
[1:35:00] i think that same thing could be applied
[1:35:02] today that a woman who pretends to be
[1:35:04] the bride of christ and basing her
[1:35:06] teaching with a cup of the filthiness
[1:35:08] filthiness of her abominations and her
[1:35:10] fornications she has tipped the cup of
[1:35:12] her fornications
[1:35:13] into the mouths of god's church that's
[1:35:15] been raised up to show his signs and
[1:35:17] wonders
[1:35:18] as jesus last commandment was to do in
[1:35:20] mark 16.
[1:35:21] and now we find that she took uh that
[1:35:24] she has took god's little faithful group
[1:35:26] and organized them together
[1:35:28] just exactly the way she did herself and
[1:35:30] has got them standing stripped
[1:35:32] denying the power thereof denying the
[1:35:34] holy spirit denying the power to speak
[1:35:35] with thanks knowing the power of the
[1:35:37] holy spirit to raise the dead
[1:35:38] to heal the sick that cast out devils
[1:35:40] and now the philistines
[1:35:42] is upon thee what are you gonna do now
[1:35:44] stripped
[1:35:45] oh what must have went through that
[1:35:47] man's mind
[1:35:49] when he found himself in this situation
[1:35:54] because remember he didn't realize that
[1:35:55] the holy ghost the spirit of god left
[1:35:57] him
[1:35:59] are we all following me
[1:36:03] and god had raised him up for this
[1:36:04] purpose and there he stands between
[1:36:07] those two posts blinded
[1:36:09] defeated humiliated and he has still the
[1:36:13] same big bulk that he ever was but his
[1:36:14] strength was gone
[1:36:16] the church is everything is stronger in
[1:36:17] membership than it ever was
[1:36:19] but where is the word the strength being
[1:36:21] manifested
[1:36:22] it's been cut off from you by your power
[1:36:25] shaving organizations
[1:36:26] he had failed god and not only had he
[1:36:28] failed god but he failed his
[1:36:30] own people he was a total failure now he
[1:36:33] was a prisoner to the very nation that
[1:36:35] god raised him
[1:36:36] up to destroy amen
[1:36:40] we are here to cast out the devil amen
[1:36:44] we are here to destroy his why was the
[1:36:46] lord manifested in the flesh to destroy
[1:36:48] the works of the devil
[1:36:50] we're not here to pull down nations this
[1:36:52] is not what i'm talking about
[1:36:54] but the he was became the very prisoner
[1:36:56] of the spirit who was meant to defeat
[1:37:02] but we're not part of an organization
[1:37:03] you can be an organization in yourself
[1:37:06] i've got it worked out i've got
[1:37:08] everything sorted out to a t but does it
[1:37:10] live
[1:37:11] does the message live it must live
[1:37:14] it's not just under be talked about it's
[1:37:16] got to be lived i mean there is as i
[1:37:18] said in the beginning there is power in
[1:37:19] the holy ghost
[1:37:20] to meet every need amen i'm going
[1:37:23] through hard things in my life it'll
[1:37:24] it'll help you it'll cause you to
[1:37:26] overcome
[1:37:27] i heard of a i heard a testimony a very
[1:37:29] brief one of her of her sister she's
[1:37:31] just been recently out of school
[1:37:33] she said before she received the holy
[1:37:34] ghost she always had trouble didn't know
[1:37:36] how to fit and felt you know
[1:37:38] worried about things but then she met
[1:37:39] god at a camp we had
[1:37:41] and then she's just happy within herself
[1:37:43] hallelujah she just continued on through
[1:37:45] school not troubled not worried
[1:37:46] why because she had the difference maker
[1:37:49] she had the holy ghost in our life
[1:37:51] hallelujah amen one day
[1:37:55] i might drag her up here to give that
[1:37:56] testimony hallelujah
[1:37:59] it really does make a difference
[1:38:02] amen we must never ever belittle what
[1:38:04] god can do
[1:38:06] i'm just working out i'm just i'm just
[1:38:08] going through some issues let him be the
[1:38:09] issue worker router
[1:38:11] let him deal with the issues but
[1:38:13] sometimes we want to hold it too close
[1:38:14] to our chest and hold on to these things
[1:38:16] because we think it's our identity our
[1:38:19] identity is this message
[1:38:20] it is the lord jesus christ yes sir but
[1:38:23] here he was
[1:38:27] but he began to think
[1:38:30] he began to think about what he was the
[1:38:34] thoughts that went through his mind
[1:38:35] yes and then he was there
[1:38:40] but he realized he he felt something on
[1:38:42] his shoulders that he hadn't felt in a
[1:38:44] very long time
[1:38:45] he felt some locks that had grown out
[1:38:48] all the way down this time when he was
[1:38:50] blinded
[1:38:52] and i don't know what is going through
[1:38:53] his mind but maybe you know there was a
[1:38:55] time when it was just a spear
[1:38:58] and he would have heard voices oh here's
[1:39:00] great samson the great champion of
[1:39:01] israel the judge of israel
[1:39:05] all these things mockers and scoffers
[1:39:07] but then there came a time where he felt
[1:39:08] something come down
[1:39:10] on his shoulders and he began to
[1:39:12] remember
[1:39:13] what his source of strength was that had
[1:39:15] grown out
[1:39:16] and he had to be led even though i was a
[1:39:18] blind man
[1:39:20] and he put his hands on those two
[1:39:22] pillars
[1:39:23] and now here he was in his moment yes
[1:39:27] hallelujah
[1:39:30] don't just stand in the temple of the
[1:39:31] philistines being mocked
[1:39:33] the devil comes and bombards us in our
[1:39:35] mind you'll never get there
[1:39:37] you'll never achieve it it's not yours
[1:39:40] you'll never save them
[1:39:41] it'll it does no good and he mocks and
[1:39:43] he and he just pushes right up in our
[1:39:45] faces and he challenges
[1:39:46] us and say you'll never be free of this
[1:39:48] you've done too much you've gone too
[1:39:50] deep you've gone too long
[1:39:51] you'll never do it samson was gone a
[1:39:53] long time but something grew out
[1:39:55] and he put his hands on those pillars he
[1:39:58] said lord i just let me die with my
[1:40:00] enemy
[1:40:01] and he didn't know maybe he had tried to
[1:40:03] push things before but it was just like
[1:40:04] the same old thing but then when he
[1:40:06] pushed that he found a power
[1:40:08] come on him that he felt many years ago
[1:40:09] maybe and the whole thing came down
[1:40:12] because he was willing to die with his
[1:40:14] enemy
[1:40:16] hallelujah it's the same thing when you
[1:40:18] are willing to die
[1:40:19] this is not about some dry eyed
[1:40:21] confession you've got to pray until you
[1:40:23] pray through
[1:40:24] you've got there's a difference between
[1:40:26] praying and really praying through
[1:40:27] there's a big difference between saying
[1:40:29] you have the holy ghost and having the
[1:40:30] holy ghost
[1:40:31] amen hallelujah yes and he died with his
[1:40:35] enemy
[1:40:38] we'll just jump this that his seat
[1:40:43] he stood there remembering his errors he
[1:40:45] remember what what caused it first what
[1:40:47] caused it first not
[1:40:48] not exactly his natural eyes put out but
[1:40:50] it was a spiritual eyes put out
[1:40:52] that he let delilah woo him into it
[1:40:55] he forgot the cause that he was upon the
[1:40:57] earth for we must never forget the cause
[1:40:59] we're here
[1:41:00] there's liberty in the camp that should
[1:41:03] be our hearts desire
[1:41:04] give me liberty or give me death amen
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:09] hallelujah lot
[1:41:14] see it's amazing when people they'll
[1:41:16] take up natural causes
[1:41:18] they try and dodge the new birth and
[1:41:19] take up a natural cause
[1:41:21] i've had someone say to me many years
[1:41:23] ago they said why can't we just help the
[1:41:25] widows and feed the orphans and do these
[1:41:27] things
[1:41:29] because they're trying to dodge a new
[1:41:30] birth
[1:41:32] and many people try and dodge dodge the
[1:41:35] real cause of christ
[1:41:36] because remember in order to enlist in
[1:41:38] this army it takes a death
[1:41:40] amen god doesn't want your natural
[1:41:42] talent he doesn't want your strength he
[1:41:44] wants your life
[1:41:45] he wants your heart that's what he wants
[1:41:47] so i've had people come to me and say
[1:41:48] why can't i just feed the orphans and
[1:41:50] i'll set up an orphanage in india and
[1:41:51] i'll do this and you know
[1:41:52] and they've just tried to dodge the new
[1:41:54] birth and they're
[1:41:56] to this day they've still dodged it but
[1:41:58] they say i know when i really when i
[1:42:00] really give my life he's really gonna
[1:42:01] i'm really gonna give it
[1:42:04] brother abraham said about branham
[1:42:06] tabernacle he said you become afraid of
[1:42:08] the new birth
[1:42:10] and people are afraid of really dying
[1:42:12] out they want to keep their composure
[1:42:15] what will this one think of me i don't
[1:42:16] want to act that kind of way i don't
[1:42:18] know what how you'll act but you'll know
[1:42:19] that something's happened
[1:42:21] remember this is not a baptist way of
[1:42:23] just getting baptized and now you're a
[1:42:25] believer now you've got it you've got to
[1:42:26] meet the giver
[1:42:28] you've really got to meet him it's good
[1:42:29] to get baptized but you've really got to
[1:42:30] meet him
[1:42:32] hallelujah so lot
[1:42:35] see lot had a different cause than
[1:42:36] abraham lot went with abraham and he was
[1:42:39] blessed he wanted to stay with him but
[1:42:40] it became trouble became too much
[1:42:43] so he went down into sodom and we know
[1:42:46] that he was in the gate because he
[1:42:48] became high up in the city he became the
[1:42:50] mayor of the city
[1:42:52] but his his life could not
[1:42:55] fix sodom and gomorrah he couldn't take
[1:42:58] up the natural cause and help the city
[1:43:01] it was too far gone and his witness
[1:43:03] actually became
[1:43:04] totally null and ineffective that even
[1:43:07] his sons-in-laws would laugh at him say
[1:43:09] when he said the angels have come to
[1:43:11] take us out because fire's gonna fall
[1:43:14] he's left but abraham
[1:43:17] you say well why are you talking about
[1:43:19] these things there's a lot of causes in
[1:43:20] the earth but what cause are we fighting
[1:43:22] for
[1:43:23] what cause we fighting for he said well
[1:43:25] at least he tried
[1:43:27] what about abraham he just said on the
[1:43:29] planes of memory he just sat there in
[1:43:31] his tent
[1:43:31] but he was waiting for the right one to
[1:43:33] come he had the right cause
[1:43:35] because he was waiting for someone to
[1:43:36] come and change his body
[1:43:38] hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:43:40] with you and i why are you here i'm
[1:43:41] waiting for a body change
[1:43:44] hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:43:49] it says that the conversation the filthy
[1:43:52] see and with vexed with filthy
[1:43:55] conversation of the wicked yes
[1:43:58] sir so he was grieved he was troubled he
[1:44:00] was vexed
[1:44:01] and that's why people have risen up
[1:44:03] let's make america great again and the
[1:44:04] whole evangelical vote swung in and
[1:44:06] and because they're looking for the
[1:44:08] wrong champion they think politics will
[1:44:10] help them politics won't help them
[1:44:12] politics will just condemn them
[1:44:14] but they're looking for the wrong
[1:44:15] champion
[1:44:17] amen people go through this through this
[1:44:19] nation oh we've got vision 2020 and this
[1:44:21] is the vision of the kingdom for new
[1:44:22] zealand forget it

[1:44:27] nation the vision for this nation is the
[1:44:29] bride's going to be lifted out of this
[1:44:30] nation
[1:44:31] hallelujah and then there's going to be
[1:44:33] a renovation and then we're going to
[1:44:35] come back and live here
[1:44:36] and the healthiest health care system
[1:44:38] will be right the education system will
[1:44:40] be right the roading will be right the
[1:44:41] transfer will be right the
[1:44:42] parks will be right i mean they you know
[1:44:44] their quality will be right everything
[1:44:46] will be right
[1:44:47] there amen
[1:44:53] you say well i'm gonna die straight
[1:44:56] you gotta call jesus on the scene we're
[1:44:59] just gonna end up here
[1:45:00] the disciples had a glorious time
[1:45:04] they had seen you can read that if you
[1:45:06] want but you know they had seen jesus do
[1:45:08] incredible things
[1:45:09] but now he is in the back of their ship
[1:45:12] and they are crossing the sea
[1:45:15] and now here comes the devil this is
[1:45:17] what the devil does
[1:45:18] he thinks jesus is asleep now i'm going
[1:45:20] to strike you know the holy ghost can
[1:45:22] lay dormant in your life
[1:45:24] brother brown talks about it you got to
[1:45:25] wake him up in the ship
[1:45:27] it's not just a natural boat that's on
[1:45:29] the scene no no this is the gospel ship
[1:45:32] he can lay dormant asleep we're going to
[1:45:35] wake him up
[1:45:37] and then say here they are they're
[1:45:38] crossing they just had a revival
[1:45:40] they're rejoicing they begin to talk
[1:45:42] about everything he did
[1:45:44] and the devil says now i've got him look
[1:45:45] he's asleep he's tired his disciples are
[1:45:47] with him but they're just talking about
[1:45:48] what's happened in the past i'm going to
[1:45:50] draw them right here
[1:45:51] but he had a cause to cross the sea yes
[1:45:53] he had a cause
[1:45:55] amen and then so every ten thousand
[1:45:58] devils brother and said got into those
[1:46:00] wounds and waves they swore they would
[1:46:02] drown them
[1:46:03] and these men are sea going men they've
[1:46:06] been raised on that sea maybe from their
[1:46:08] birth
[1:46:08] they knew how to handle that boat they
[1:46:10] maybe built that boat
[1:46:11] they knew how every condition they could
[1:46:14] read the water when a gust would come
[1:46:15] through
[1:46:16] they knew exactly you know that they
[1:46:18] could tell what's happening
[1:46:21] so in their humanity they try and keep
[1:46:23] the ship afloat
[1:46:26] this is probably the worst thing they
[1:46:28] could do why go through all this trouble
[1:46:31] when you've got the one who made the
[1:46:33] wind in the sea
[1:46:34] you've got the master of the wind in
[1:46:36] your boat why go through all that
[1:46:38] trouble and try and
[1:46:39] you know maybe fill the cells a bit
[1:46:41] peter maybe just turn the order but you
[1:46:42] know turn into the swell a bit more so
[1:46:44] we're not going to capsize and you know
[1:46:46] turn it down you'd go go bow down as you
[1:46:48] go down the swell and
[1:46:50] you know robert harder bale a bit more
[1:46:52] here why do all that when you've got the
[1:46:55] master of the wind
[1:46:56] right any and he's right there he knew
[1:46:58] this was going to happen
[1:47:00] oh but i've got this sword and i know
[1:47:02] and yeah i know what i can achieve and
[1:47:03] what i can do and
[1:47:05] maybe if we just approach it this way
[1:47:06] maybe if we just do it this way honey
[1:47:08] maybe we just tried this and
[1:47:09] no call the master awake call the master
[1:47:12] on the scene
[1:47:13] hallelujah remember god just doesn't
[1:47:15] live in church
[1:47:17] amen god just doesn't live in church god
[1:47:19] lives in our houses
[1:47:20] god comes down i trust you can say god
[1:47:22] has literally come down to my house
[1:47:24] and we've had a prayer meeting with
[1:47:25] almighty god hallelujah
[1:47:27] it doesn't matter maybe what the
[1:47:28] children are doing god comes down
[1:47:32] hallelujah that's why i love lockdown

[1:47:36] had we had prayer god came down
[1:47:41] and and and it wasn't just us feeling
[1:47:42] good he came down
[1:47:44] and they all knew he came down
[1:47:48] hallelujah
[1:47:50] you got to wake him up wake up the holy
[1:47:53] ghost in your life stop trying to take
[1:47:55] control of everything
[1:47:56] that's the problem with man and then
[1:47:58] also you say well i don't know how this
[1:47:59] works we go on youtube and we get it
[1:48:03] you know or we just google oh this is
[1:48:05] how we handle this
[1:48:06] and we go through all the psychology in
[1:48:08] the world and all this and this and this
[1:48:09] and this and this
[1:48:10] we need to wake up the master we need to
[1:48:13] wake up the master of the ship
[1:48:14] they were drowning they they were gonna
[1:48:17] drown
[1:48:18] and then they and then they came to the
[1:48:19] end of their natural ability to keep the
[1:48:21] boat afloat
[1:48:23] and then one of them remembered
[1:48:26] yes we have this one master
[1:48:31] don't you care that we perish and they
[1:48:33] wake him up and he's like maybe because

[1:49:02] and he just said peace be still and the
[1:49:05] winds and the waves had to obey him
[1:49:07] because he was the maker of it now here
