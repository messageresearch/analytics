[51:24] um so yeah thank you for your prayers
[51:27] um
[51:28] luke two and one
[51:32] we're going to read down to verse 20.
[51:37] and it came to pass in those days
[51:40] that there went out a decree from caesar
[51:42] augustus that all the world should be
[51:44] taxed and this taxing was first made
[51:46] when cyrenius was governor of syria
[51:49] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[51:51] his own city and joseph also went up
[51:54] from galilee out of the city of nazareth
[51:57] into judea unto the city of david which
[51:59] is called bethlehem because he was of
[52:02] the house and lineage of david
[52:04] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife
[52:07] being great with child and so it was
[52:09] that while they were there the days were
[52:12] accomplished that she should be
[52:14] delivered and she brought forth her
[52:16] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[52:18] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[52:20] manger because there is no room for them
[52:22] in the end
[52:23] and they were in the same country
[52:24] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[52:27] watch over their flock by night and lo
[52:29] the angel of the lord came upon them and
[52:32] the glory of the lord shone round about
[52:34] them and they were sore afraid
[52:36] and the angel said unto them fear not
[52:39] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[52:41] great joy which shall be to all people
[52:44] for unto you is born this day in the
[52:47] city of david a savior which is christ
[52:49] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[52:52] you you shall find the babe wrapped in
[52:54] swaddling clothes laying in a manger and
[52:56] suddenly there was with the angel a
[52:59] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[53:01] god and saying glory to god in the
[53:04] highest and on earth peace good will
[53:06] toward men
[53:07] and it came to pass as the angels were
[53:09] gone away from uh from them into heaven
[53:12] the shepherd said one to another let us
[53:15] now go even unto bethlehem and see this
[53:18] thing which has come to pass which the
[53:20] lord hath made known unto us
[53:23] and they came with haste and found mary
[53:26] and joseph and the babe laying in a
[53:27] manger and when they had seen it they
[53:30] were they made known abroad the saying
[53:33] which was told them concerning this
[53:34] child and all they that heard it
[53:37] wondered at those things which were told
[53:39] them by the shepherds but mary kept all
[53:42] these things uh and pondered them in her
[53:44] heart and the shepherds returned
[53:46] glorifying and praising god for all the
[53:49] things with that which they had heard
[53:51] and seen as it was told unto them amen
[53:56] let's bow heads in a word of prayer this
[53:58] morning

[54:02] before you with great thanksgiving in
[54:04] our hearts lord and great reverence lord

[55:06] lord we need you lord jesus to make your
[55:09] word live in our hearts so may you grant
[55:10] it for your glory we thank you for this
[55:12] day lord in jesus christ's name amen
[55:16] amen god bless you friends you may have
[55:17] your seats this morning
[55:19] this may seem like a bit of an
[55:20] elementary kind of a service but i want
[55:23] to talk about the testimony of a
[55:24] believer now here we are
[55:27] you know this
[55:28] i love luke chapter 2 you know this is
[55:31] one of my favorite parts of the gospel
[55:33] here and when when jesus is taken into
[55:35] the temple and you know it's amazing
[55:37] where there can be great events going on
[55:40] in the world but god makes sure his
[55:41] elect know what's going on and that
[55:43] they're a part of what's going on not
[55:45] just we would see and no this is
[55:46] happening but you'd realize that we're
[55:48] part of it now if we could just be
[55:50] transported 2 000 years ago back into
[55:53] the hills of bethlehem we're sitting
[55:54] with the shepherds there you know no
[55:56] doubt you know it's always what's
[55:57] happening in the world is normally the
[55:59] topic of conversation you know this has
[56:01] been since time has began whatever is
[56:03] trending is trending and conversation
[56:05] too and so no doubt they would be
[56:07] talking about you know i don't know
[56:08] exactly how they had it but you know
[56:10] they're looking after their sheep on the
[56:11] hills and you know maybe they would
[56:13] count them you know every so often make
[56:15] sure they're all there and they're all
[56:16] sleeping and you know as they're sitting
[56:18] around the campfire they look up in the
[56:19] heavens and maybe they talk about their
[56:21] flocks and their family and and but but
[56:23] no doubt their conversation will
[56:25] gravitate towards what's going on
[56:27] because you know they didn't have to
[56:28] travel somewhere because of this law of
[56:30] of of the caesar you know they were from
[56:32] bethlehem they had probably maybe
[56:34] already given their money and you know
[56:36] but they would have been talking about
[56:37] how the city was was full and maybe they
[56:40] talked about this taxation how there was
[56:42] now a great economic pressure on the
[56:44] people and you know you know this is a
[56:46] parallel of today
[56:48] you know you know we are we are living
[56:49] this out you know this is there's really
[56:51] nothing new under the heavens you know
[56:53] there's been end times before there's an
[56:54] end time in the days of noah there's an
[56:56] end time you could say for uh israel
[56:59] being stuck in egypt you know there's an
[57:01] end time you know these shepherds were
[57:02] living in the end time of of the old
[57:05] laws you know of the blood of bulls and
[57:07] ghosts there was an end to that and now
[57:08] a new era was coming in so there was an
[57:10] end time there you know and now we're
[57:12] living in the end time of end times
[57:15] hallelujah all those ones are pointing
[57:17] there was an end time for sodom and
[57:18] gomorrah they had their end time right
[57:21] and all those things are pointing to
[57:23] right now so where these shepherds are
[57:25] sitting is really where we're sitting
[57:27] you know we yeah i trust when we read
[57:29] the scripture we can see hey we're
[57:30] living this out this seems very familiar
[57:33] this seems eerily familiar that what i'm
[57:35] reading in the news these people are
[57:37] living and because it's pointing to
[57:39] today now so there was a great economic
[57:41] pressure uh in that day of this taxation
[57:44] and you know we know we're under a
[57:45] pressure of economics today
[57:47] you know inflation's gone up you know
[57:49] there's taxes coming different things
[57:51] trouble and can't seem to make ends meet
[57:53] and house prices have gone up and you
[57:55] know so here we are we're living in the
[57:58] same kind of an era and but yeah i said
[58:01] it a few weeks ago but i just want to
[58:02] kind of repeat it again this morning you
[58:05] know we can look in through natural eyes
[58:07] and what's going on in the world and we
[58:08] can become upset
[58:10] but that's just looking through natural
[58:12] eyes all we can look through spiritual
[58:14] eyes
[58:15] and praise the lord
[58:16] because really if they if you know
[58:18] before the angel came to them maybe they
[58:20] were quite upset we got taxed i can
[58:23] barely afford to feed my family my flock
[58:25] hasn't increased much this year and you
[58:27] know there's more pressure you have the
[58:28] pharisees and scribes they want more for
[58:30] offerings and you know the houses are
[58:32] getting smaller the population's
[58:33] increasing and there's nowhere to build
[58:35] and the council wants to do this and
[58:37] this and you know i've got trouble here
[58:38] and you know but that was before the
[58:40] angels came
[58:41] you know they could complain all they
[58:43] wanted before the angel came i mean but
[58:45] after the angel came to them i mean they
[58:47] had a different kind of a message i mean
[58:50] they had a different kind of what was
[58:51] trending was totally different
[58:53] hallelujah so you know but but all that
[58:56] was you even take you know that that's
[58:58] easy you say how dare he make this rule
[59:00] that people got to travel for taxation
[59:02] and you know but all of that i'd say god
[59:04] inspired him
[59:06] to make that decree that was god's
[59:08] inspiration
[59:09] yeah we can get upset but you know
[59:11] how do you know it's not god inspiring
[59:14] to make a people move i mean just like
[59:16] joseph and mary they had to move from
[59:18] nazareth they couldn't stay there for
[59:19] jesus to be born i mean there was there
[59:22] was a there was a time as soon as she
[59:23] conceived by the holy ghost there was a
[59:25] nine month timer was counting down and
[59:27] within that nine months she had to get
[59:29] to bethlehem and mary and joseph weren't
[59:31] going to travel there when she's
[59:32] pregnant so there had to be a law come
[59:34] into place to make them move from one
[59:36] place to another that the word can be
[59:38] fulfilled now i pray we can look in the
[59:40] message look in the scripture and
[59:42] realize that god is moving us
[59:45] we can complain all we want but you're
[59:46] looking through the wrong eyes we should
[59:48] say lift up your heads and know your
[59:50] redemption draweth nigh and because god
[59:52] is moving a people not necessarily from
[59:54] one part of the earth to the other i
[59:56] mean but from one spiritual condition to
[59:58] another into a body change
[1:00:01] hallelujah so everything we see around
[1:00:03] us is the fulfillment of scripture
[1:00:06] but the carnal mind will complain the
[1:00:08] spiritual will rejoice
[1:00:10] in the trial
[1:00:12] hallelujah
[1:00:13] so they could talk about the injustice
[1:00:15] of the taxation they can talk about the
[1:00:17] all those kind of things but it was the
[1:00:19] word being fulfilled
[1:00:21] but they had to have a visitation of an
[1:00:24] angel for them to their eyes come open
[1:00:26] now we know that really what we're
[1:00:28] living has been prophesied of
[1:00:31] right now
[1:00:32] jesus would say can you put up luke 21
[1:00:35] 25 for me please
[1:00:37] we'll get to the shepherds but i just
[1:00:38] want to you know
[1:00:40] this is better than today's news
[1:00:42] this is not an analysis or opinion piece
[1:00:46] or whatever no this is news
[1:00:48] there's no slant on this
[1:00:51] oh there's no filter there's no agenda
[1:00:53] or is this left is this left wing or
[1:00:55] right-wing conservative or liberal no
[1:00:57] it's god's truth
[1:00:59] it's god's word
[1:01:01] hallelujah so there shall be signs in
[1:01:03] the sun so no no jesus is speaking of
[1:01:05] today
[1:01:06] there shall be signs in the sun and the
[1:01:08] moon and the stars and upon the earth
[1:01:10] the stress of nations
[1:01:12] now distress is extreme anxiety sorrow
[1:01:15] or pain
[1:01:17] is there distress in the world
[1:01:19] are they you know you look at the news
[1:01:21] and people say there's going to be war
[1:01:22] with china
[1:01:24] it's not even a maybe it's going to
[1:01:26] happen
[1:01:27] so there's now distress oh you say but
[1:01:30] we're on this
[1:01:32] you know we're on this island nation we
[1:01:34] won't escape this
[1:01:36] we won't escape this one
[1:01:38] whether you like it or not oh no we'll
[1:01:40] just be kind and whatever no no it's not
[1:01:42] going to work
[1:01:43] this whole world's under judgment
[1:01:46] so there's distress
[1:01:48] extreme anxiety sorrow or pain
[1:01:52] of nations and perplexity
[1:01:55] uh with perplexity now perplexity is an
[1:01:57] inability to deal with or understand
[1:02:00] something it's just too big of a problem
[1:02:03] oh the climate is too big of a problem
[1:02:05] oh easy to cut down ceo yeah co2 gases
[1:02:08] it's not that simple
[1:02:12] you know on paper it may be very easy
[1:02:14] but it's it's you know someone said to
[1:02:16] me this is years ago they asked the
[1:02:17] question to me well why doesn't the oil
[1:02:19] and gas industry just go green i say
[1:02:21] well if you have invested tens of
[1:02:23] hundreds of billions of dollars into
[1:02:24] infrastructure do you think you're just
[1:02:25] gonna write that off and do something
[1:02:26] else
[1:02:28] but the greed of man holds it in this
[1:02:30] way you know man fallen man brings
[1:02:32] judgment upon himself
[1:02:34] and the destruction of the planet will
[1:02:36] be actually man bringing judgment upon
[1:02:37] themselves
[1:02:38] but the problem is actually too big
[1:02:42] whether you like it or not
[1:02:44] it's too big so what is that perplexity
[1:02:46] inability to deal with or understand
[1:02:48] something
[1:02:50] why is there such a mental health crisis
[1:02:52] i just throw more money at it it's not
[1:02:54] going to fix it
[1:02:55] because the fabric of society is broken
[1:02:58] family structure is broken amen the
[1:03:01] whole world projects a fake life upon us
[1:03:04] movies are fake why would you want to be
[1:03:06] like an actor they're pretending to be
[1:03:08] someone else i mean but when they take
[1:03:10] off the mask and they go home they just
[1:03:12] have broken lives broken marriages a
[1:03:14] bunch of drugs up their veins to try and
[1:03:16] find peace and they end up dying or
[1:03:18] whatever just broken i don't want to be
[1:03:20] like that kind of person
[1:03:23] i don't want to be i want to be
[1:03:24] something real
[1:03:25] the world's looking for something real
[1:03:27] but the world is giving the world fake
[1:03:29] so be like this guy be like this
[1:03:31] instagram filter you can't take a photo
[1:03:33] of something and live in that photo
[1:03:36] that's what some people try and you know
[1:03:37] the world projects us your life can be
[1:03:39] like this and it's a still frame shot of
[1:03:40] somewhere that's been filtered to the
[1:03:42] nth degree and stage completely and they
[1:03:44] project it to you and say this is how
[1:03:46] life should be
[1:03:47] and that's why there's so much mental
[1:03:49] illness because people try and live in a
[1:03:50] fantasy world but you got to live in the
[1:03:52] real world and you can people bury
[1:03:54] themselves in all kinds of cosplay and

[1:06:19] the climate is ruined the planet is
[1:06:20] ruined
[1:06:22] you know
[1:06:23] there are micro plastics in everything
[1:06:25] pretty much
[1:06:27] in the sea
[1:06:29] in what you eat the water you drink
[1:06:33] it's been proven that this kind of water
[1:06:35] has microplastics in it because of the
[1:06:38] bottle
[1:06:42] that is stuffing up our ecosystem not
[1:06:45] just you but the whole ecosystem

[1:07:06] god told us they would be here we
[1:07:08] shouldn't be surprised they'd be here
[1:07:10] but if you're surprised you will be
[1:07:12] perplexed with the world and living in
[1:07:14] fear

[1:07:17] the world even in this country
[1:07:20] but where but the angel when he came to
[1:07:22] the shepherds he said fear not
[1:07:24] amen so that's the first thing every
[1:07:26] time pretty much that i could find in
[1:07:28] the scripture when an angel comes to a
[1:07:29] believer the first thing they say is
[1:07:31] fear not
[1:07:33] i mean so that's why we have received an
[1:07:35] angelic visitation in this day and it's
[1:07:37] got to be personal amen and the angels
[1:07:40] telling you of the lord saying fear not
[1:07:42] do not be afraid of this current don't

[1:07:56] universe you're in his mind i mean you
[1:07:59] came from god you go back to god amen
[1:08:01] you're you're his beloved amen here he
[1:08:04] ransom you with his blood he's not going
[1:08:06] to let one of his children perish they
[1:08:08] cannot perish they are his amen the
[1:08:10] devil may try and destroy us but we will
[1:08:12] not be destroyed amen he shall be

[1:08:57] see that you be not troubled
[1:09:00] let the rumors let the rumor mill just
[1:09:02] go in overdrive
[1:09:04] don't be troubled
[1:09:06] see that you be not troubled for all
[1:09:08] these things must come to pass but the
[1:09:10] end is not yet for nation shall rise
[1:09:12] against nation and kingdom against
[1:09:14] kingdom
[1:09:16] front page news
[1:09:18] and there shall be famines
[1:09:20] and pestilences
[1:09:22] and earthquakes and diverse places i
[1:09:24] said a while ago maybe i just said it to
[1:09:26] christine i said well we've had the
[1:09:27] famines we've had the earthquakes and
[1:09:29] divers places now here's the pestilence
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:34] it had we shouldn't be surprised oh
[1:09:37] global pandemic yeah this blindsided us
[1:09:40] if we're reading the real news
[1:09:42] we'd say yeah it's right on schedule
[1:09:45] it's right on schedule it's always under
[1:09:47] budget with god it never blows out
[1:09:49] amen you know so it's we shouldn't be
[1:09:52] surprised by these things
[1:09:54] so don't be troubled
[1:09:56] amen now
[1:09:58] brother braham says in a man running
[1:09:59] from the presence of the lord 1965 he
[1:10:01] says we believe that we're living in the
[1:10:03] hour that when god is doing something we
[1:10:06] believe that we're living among them now
[1:10:09] i believe tonight i'm preaching to that
[1:10:11] congregation now i'll say this morning
[1:10:13] that's laying and waiting out there just
[1:10:15] to get ripe i really believe that with
[1:10:17] all my heart i would say it's the same
[1:10:20] now as it's always been
[1:10:22] now we believe that the hour has come
[1:10:24] that saint john 14 12 must be fulfilled
[1:10:27] we
[1:10:28] rodney we believe that malachi 4 must be
[1:10:31] fulfilled
[1:10:33] we believe that luke 17 30 must be
[1:10:35] fulfilled we believe that all these
[1:10:37] prophecies that he said will come to
[1:10:39] pass in this day
[1:10:40] we believe they must be fulfilled and we
[1:10:42] believe we're seeing them fulfilled
[1:10:44] right now
[1:10:45] exactly right
[1:10:46] because remember malachi 4 is not just
[1:10:49] an elijah ministry the ministry of
[1:10:51] brother brahm coming to the earth says
[1:10:53] behold i god send you who's you me
[1:10:56] elijah the prophet to do what to turn my
[1:10:58] heart back to the original faith of the
[1:11:00] fathers i mean so there's you in that
[1:11:02] scripture too
[1:11:03] that's not a one-man scripture that's
[1:11:05] that's the prophet amen with the
[1:11:07] ministry to turn the heart of the bride
[1:11:08] back the original faith of the fathers
[1:11:10] hallelujah so that's why we can say that
[1:11:12] is still being fulfilled
[1:11:15] i wasn't here in 1965 i wasn't here in
[1:11:17] 63 and the seals are open but i'm here
[1:11:20] and god knew that i would be here in
[1:11:22] this time and any new that boy's heart's
[1:11:24] got to get turned
[1:11:26] because i want him to walk with me i
[1:11:28] want him to be back to the original
[1:11:30] faith not the faith of a church or
[1:11:31] denomination man's opinion but back to
[1:11:33] the apostolic faith of the fathers
[1:11:36] hallelujah
[1:11:38] amen and also luke 17 30 the son of man
[1:11:41] is now being revealed through a
[1:11:42] multi-membered body
[1:11:44] jesus christ
[1:11:46] he says stop running
[1:11:48] don't get out of his presence just keep
[1:11:50] moving up into his presence
[1:11:52] amen that's what so stop running but
[1:11:55] move up into his presence now
[1:11:57] in order to how do you get out of his
[1:11:58] presence well you can be out of his
[1:12:00] presence sitting here by thinking about
[1:12:02] something else
[1:12:03] you can be preoccupied you can let the
[1:12:04] devil take you on some garden path and
[1:12:06] think about other things and you know
[1:12:09] that's that's getting out of his
[1:12:10] presence
[1:12:11] you want to get into his presence you
[1:12:13] want to say hey man you want to engage
[1:12:14] let's lock in
[1:12:16] i mean let's not be distracted by books
[1:12:18] and things and you know different you
[1:12:20] know let's be engaged let's we're going
[1:12:22] to heaven
[1:12:23] hey lilia we're going to heaven
[1:12:25] hallelujah
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:29] amen i'll do it brother and paul call
[1:12:30] some names
[1:12:31] are we here
[1:12:33] good morning hallelujah hey we're going
[1:12:35] to have church
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:37] hallelujah i mean we want to get up into
[1:12:40] his presence so the you say well you
[1:12:42] know
[1:12:43] and one way to get out of his presence
[1:12:45] is the devil to make you think it may be
[1:12:47] for someone else but not for you
[1:12:49] oh sure he can save anyone but
[1:12:52] not me
[1:12:53] no that's a lie he can say when i met
[1:12:56] the lord i just became so convinced if
[1:12:58] he can save this guy he can save anyone
[1:13:00] there's no too hard basket for god
[1:13:03] hallelujah the devil may think it's too
[1:13:04] hard but he's never been saved he's
[1:13:06] never been redeemed he's never known
[1:13:08] what it's like to be forgiven
[1:13:11] holy so he tries to put his experience
[1:13:12] on you and i
[1:13:14] amen so so the devil tries to make us
[1:13:16] think we're not worthy that forgiveness
[1:13:19] by the blood of jesus christ is not for
[1:13:21] us
[1:13:21] and also another way am i doing that
[1:13:25] okay
[1:13:27] anyway the simplest way also so so the
[1:13:29] devil gets us into a thought pattern
[1:13:32] that there is never a way of escape out
[1:13:34] of his condemnation
[1:13:36] that's how you know the devil's talking
[1:13:38] to you
[1:13:39] that he never gives a way of escape
[1:13:41] he just says you've done wrong you've
[1:13:43] done wrong
[1:13:44] and you did that wrong i'm going to
[1:13:45] remind you you've done wrong you thought
[1:13:47] this you went and did this and yeah god
[1:13:48] sees everything the devil knows that too
[1:13:51] and he reminds you as well but he never
[1:13:53] but the difference between the devil
[1:13:56] condemning someone and god convicting
[1:13:58] someone as god always gives a way of
[1:14:00] escape
[1:14:02] and he gives you he actually convicts
[1:14:04] you of sin because he doesn't want you
[1:14:05] to be stuck in that sin he doesn't want
[1:14:07] you to be branded with the devil's
[1:14:09] working but he wants to fill you with
[1:14:11] his presence he wants you to walk with
[1:14:13] him
[1:14:15] i mean so god always gives a way out and
[1:14:17] that way out is a heartfelt repentance
[1:14:20] amen so we don't want to and and really
[1:14:24] we have to categorize anything the devil
[1:14:26] tries to use to condemn us as lying
[1:14:29] vanities
[1:14:31] that's the that's the that's the filing
[1:14:33] system
[1:14:34] lying vanities
[1:14:36] it doesn't matter how real it may seem
[1:14:38] how alive it may be how much it makes
[1:14:41] your senses go your imagination or you
[1:14:43] know you got to put it into one basket
[1:14:45] lying vanity
[1:14:47] you take the prophet jonah
[1:14:49] the prophet jonah was surrounded by his
[1:14:51] problem
[1:14:52] it was pressing against him
[1:14:54] he was breathing it in he couldn't you
[1:14:56] know it was his problem surrounded him
[1:14:58] so much there was no light in that place
[1:15:00] now that place i'm talking about is a
[1:15:01] whale's belly
[1:15:03] you know there's you know you know they
[1:15:04] dramatize it there's light in the belly
[1:15:06] there's no light in that belly
[1:15:08] you know jonah didn't have some torch or
[1:15:10] some smartphone turn it on
[1:15:12] you know
[1:15:13] scroll and now i've got oh i've got five
[1:15:15] percent battery help me god you know no
[1:15:18] no no there was no light in that belly i
[1:15:20] was pressing against him
[1:15:22] right and we know the lord
[1:15:23] supernaturally allowed him to have three
[1:15:25] days of oxygen
[1:15:27] but his his lying vanities and remember
[1:15:30] he ended up there because of his choice
[1:15:33] no one pressured him to go to tarshish
[1:15:35] you know no one pressured him he he just
[1:15:37] pressured himself i don't want to go
[1:15:38] there i'm going to go here
[1:15:40] and so his own choice caused him to be
[1:15:42] surrounded by whale's belly his own
[1:15:45] choices made him to be in this place and
[1:15:46] no doubt the devil would say you're
[1:15:48] stuck
[1:15:49] have you ever seen a guy get out of a
[1:15:51] whale's belly
[1:15:52] no
[1:15:54] and you're in there you're gonna be fit
[1:15:56] you are fish food
[1:15:58] god's god's judged you
[1:16:01] because of your choice you chose wrong
[1:16:03] jonah
[1:16:04] you should have obeyed the word of god
[1:16:06] but now you've done you went and did
[1:16:07] your own thing and look where your own
[1:16:08] things brought you
[1:16:11] but the thing is jonah began to realize
[1:16:14] that his the whale's belly that
[1:16:16] surrounds him
[1:16:18] is just lying vanities and he would
[1:16:20] begin to pray to god and he'd say they
[1:16:23] that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:16:26] their own mercy
[1:16:27] now to observe something means to study
[1:16:29] to to to comprehend it to really focus
[1:16:32] upon it and you know so if you focus on
[1:16:34] your lying vanities well i did this sin
[1:16:36] and this and i did this in secret i feel
[1:16:38] so condemned by that
[1:16:39] if you focus on those things you forsake
[1:16:42] your own mercy
[1:16:44] so jonah realized that it was god
[1:16:46] telling him there's a way out of this
[1:16:48] it may seem it's humanly impossible you
[1:16:50] are actually being digested
[1:16:52] by in a whale's belly
[1:16:55] humanly it's impossible but with god
[1:16:57] nothing's impossible god can get you out
[1:16:59] of the deepest darkest pit amen but
[1:17:02] you've got to call upon him and say i
[1:17:04] don't want this pit no more you can get
[1:17:06] very used to being in the muck of sin
[1:17:08] but i pray to god god would you shake
[1:17:10] each one of us that we get out of this
[1:17:12] little world that we're built in amen we
[1:17:14] can look to calvary and be free
[1:17:17] hallelujah
[1:17:19] now brother brown would say
[1:17:21] uh in the message without money or
[1:17:23] without price
[1:17:24] now he's talking about a he's
[1:17:26] paralleling a car being crashing into a
[1:17:28] ditch getting pulling it out speaking of
[1:17:30] a person in sin he says now yet how much
[1:17:33] greater ditch has sin throwed you in
[1:17:36] who could never get you out of the ditch
[1:17:38] of sin who could ever get you out of the
[1:17:41] ditch of sin but god takes you out of
[1:17:43] the ditch of sin without money without
[1:17:45] price
[1:17:46] when there is no one could take you out
[1:17:49] if you don't pay if you don't pay daily
[1:17:52] for your wrecker pulling you'll stay in
[1:17:54] the ditches saying you know in those
[1:17:55] days you had to pay for a wrecker to
[1:17:58] come pull your car out of the ditch
[1:17:59] you'll pay you know you'll pay for it if
[1:18:01] you don't do that your car stays in the
[1:18:02] ditch
[1:18:04] you've got to have the money or you stay
[1:18:06] in the ditch
[1:18:07] but the worst ditch you ever gotten is
[1:18:09] what the devil throwed you in the ditch
[1:18:12] of sin and unbelief god willingly will
[1:18:14] pull you out without money without cost
[1:18:18] and yet you lay in the ditch just
[1:18:20] sloshing in sin and don't even call upon
[1:18:23] him
[1:18:24] so that's the one thing to get you out
[1:18:26] is you've got to call lord i want out i
[1:18:28] don't want to slush anymore jonah did a
[1:18:30] lot of sloshing but he had to call
[1:18:32] amen and god got him out of that whale's
[1:18:34] belly so we just got a call lord jesus i
[1:18:37] don't want to slush
[1:18:38] the world is sloshing i don't want to
[1:18:41] slosh
[1:18:42] hallelujah
[1:18:44] and you call upon him he'll pull you out
[1:18:47] if you really want to be out
[1:18:49] some people they just want to stay they
[1:18:51] actually enjoy it
[1:18:53] we don't want to enjoy
[1:18:55] god has way more for us
[1:18:56] you think the devil the devil just
[1:18:58] perverts what god has why would you want
[1:19:00] the perversion when you can have the
[1:19:02] real
[1:19:03] and that real is not just life life more
[1:19:05] abundantly and there's heaven too it
[1:19:08] doesn't come to an end
[1:19:10] hallelujah
[1:19:12] amen so the so the shepherds were there
[1:19:14] on the judean hills complaining about
[1:19:17] taxation and people moving and what the
[1:19:19] government's doing and this is wrong and
[1:19:21] you know blah blah
[1:19:23] and um
[1:19:25] but then the angel came to him said fear
[1:19:26] not
[1:19:27] amen and we know this world is gripped
[1:19:29] and fear but we're told not to fear
[1:19:31] you've got to choose not to fear the
[1:19:32] lord is my shield the lord is my buckler
[1:19:35] he's my high tower he's my rock he's my
[1:19:37] fortress he's my refuge he's a great
[1:19:39] captain in this battle he fights my
[1:19:41] battles i mean he's here to protect me
[1:19:43] he's going to see me through he's my
[1:19:44] deliverer amen he's my shield he's my
[1:19:47] portion amen he's my inheritance all
[1:19:49] that i am is in him hallelujah
[1:19:52] amen fear not why should we fear
[1:19:56] fear has helped nobody no time
[1:19:59] faith delivers
[1:20:01] brother brown was us you know well he
[1:20:04] says fear hasn't helped anyone
[1:20:06] and then and then he asked the question
[1:20:08] well what why he's asked the question
[1:20:09] well what can faith do he said faith
[1:20:12] might deliver me
[1:20:14] hallelujah
[1:20:15] and i'd rather die believing
[1:20:18] than die in fear
[1:20:20] because even the scripture says that the
[1:20:21] fearful actually end up in the lake of
[1:20:23] fire
[1:20:24] so fear not don't let that spirit come
[1:20:26] upon you and you up your life no
[1:20:28] we're not here i love that song that the
[1:20:30] boy sung but we're not just survivors

[1:20:37] just somehow i'm so glad we no we're
[1:20:39] here to overcome amen through our god we
[1:20:42] will overcome this age the lukewarmness
[1:20:44] will not get us it may try and sweep in
[1:20:46] but there's something in us that pushes
[1:20:48] it back out hallelujah amen
[1:20:51] we will overcome the sage because he the
[1:20:54] great overcomer is in you and i if you
[1:20:56] have the baptism of the holy ghost he
[1:20:58] who has overcome hell death and the
[1:21:00] grave is already in you and you've got
[1:21:02] to realize brother ham said i mean to
[1:21:04] overcome you must realize that the god
[1:21:06] in you has already overcome all things
[1:21:08] he already overcomes sickness temptation
[1:21:10] he's overcome lies pressure whatever it
[1:21:12] may be sickness death hell itself he's
[1:21:15] already overcome it and he's in you
[1:21:18] hallelujah
[1:21:20] amen you've got to realize if you've got
[1:21:21] trouble in your life god's already

[1:21:24] your jesus has already overcome it and
[1:21:26] if he's in you then this thing will be
[1:21:28] overcome as well
[1:21:29] i mean because our god is a creature of
[1:21:31] habit
[1:21:33] hallelujah hey there's bad habits to
[1:21:34] have but there's good habits to have
[1:21:36] hallelujah it is a good habit to read
[1:21:38] your bible pray every day it's a good
[1:21:40] habit to think on god it's a good habit
[1:21:42] not to lean on the arm of flesh but to
[1:21:44] lean on the arms of the lord it's a good
[1:21:46] habit to commit all that waste to lord
[1:21:48] and he'll direct my path those are good
[1:21:50] habits to have and it's good habits
[1:21:52] always to testify of good things
[1:21:54] never to have it never have a negative
[1:21:56] testimony in spite of what you're seeing
[1:21:58] what you're facing you know i was so
[1:22:01] down in the dumps yesterday and then
[1:22:02] christine sends me through a whatsapp of
[1:22:04] a quote
[1:22:05] oh let's just wait i'll read it
[1:22:11] where are we here we are
[1:22:14] you must never
[1:22:16] you must never say no she says i love
[1:22:18] this quote i love this quote too you
[1:22:19] must never say that don't never let your
[1:22:22] testimony be negative
[1:22:24] let it be positive all the time i'm
[1:22:26] saved i have god in my heart i believe
[1:22:28] him with all my heart
[1:22:30] i mean so our testimony should be
[1:22:32] positive irrespective of what we see
[1:22:35] what we may be facing our testimony
[1:22:38] should always be positive our god's in
[1:22:40] control
[1:22:41] he's working in this problem i mean god
[1:22:44] loves a crisis because he steps into
[1:22:46] that crisis he proves himself alive and
[1:22:48] real i mean he manifests his power and
[1:22:51] then after the end of the crisis we say
[1:22:53] how did we ever doubt him
[1:22:56] so we must have that same kind of
[1:22:58] attitude not just after the crisis but
[1:23:00] in the crisis how we're going to get
[1:23:02] through this god's here
[1:23:04] how are we going to survive god's going
[1:23:06] to make us survive how are we going to
[1:23:07] overcome this devil god's here
[1:23:10] the one who's overcome all things is
[1:23:12] right here
[1:23:13] he's not just with us he's in us
[1:23:16] do you believe that
[1:23:18] brother and said how long you saved your
[1:23:20] long as you believe it

[1:25:15] for i want those things and always tell
[1:25:18] lie oh yeah that's a good one no we
[1:25:20] never ask for these things
[1:25:22] but somehow we just find ourselves with
[1:25:24] them and as life goes on you say well
[1:25:27] where did that come from
[1:25:29] well it it entered in the family tree
[1:25:31] somewhere
[1:25:32] and you just happen to be on that family
[1:25:34] tree
[1:25:35] and the devil says well
[1:25:37] this is just how you have to be who said
[1:25:41] the devil's not my god
[1:25:43] he is not my creator
[1:25:45] he didn't make me
[1:25:47] amen and when god saw me he didn't see
[1:25:49] me with these failures of my character
[1:25:52] he saw me made in his image i mean so
[1:25:54] i'd rather start confessing i'm a son of
[1:25:56] god
[1:25:57] i'm a daughter of god hallelujah i'm a
[1:25:59] child of god i mean if i'm a child of
[1:26:02] god if the only begotten son overcame
[1:26:05] amen and his life is in me i'm going to
[1:26:07] overcome
[1:26:09] that's what we should confess
[1:26:10] amen he cast out the devil because he
[1:26:12] knew who he was
[1:26:14] hallelujah
[1:26:16] amen if we realize who we are
[1:26:18] amen the devil wants to say we're a
[1:26:20] bluff we're in a bluff
[1:26:22] he's a bluff we ain't a bluff you ain't
[1:26:24] a bluff i mean you've got authority to
[1:26:26] tell the devil where to go
[1:26:28] you do he says no you've got no power
[1:26:31] over me he said no no hold on jesus
[1:26:33] conquered you
[1:26:34] where's your keys gone boy
[1:26:37] and he said and if he was honest he'd
[1:26:39] say i don't know but he'd try and lie
[1:26:40] and say well i've got a spare set no he
[1:26:42] don't got no spare set one key
[1:26:45] one key
[1:26:46] he don't have a spare one hallelujah say
[1:26:49] well where are those keys my lord has
[1:26:51] those keys and he placed the authority
[1:26:53] amen of those keys into you and i
[1:26:56] that we can tell the devil to go
[1:26:58] anyplace anytime anywhere just tell them
[1:27:00] to get you don't have to wait to come
[1:27:01] into church oh they've got no no the
[1:27:03] same atmosphere that's here sure the
[1:27:05] atmosphere gets great as we gather we
[1:27:07] bring our licks of fire i mean you know
[1:27:09] brother baby says that god the fullness
[1:27:11] of god here bodily is upon the earth in
[1:27:13] a multi-member bride that's why the
[1:27:15] body's got to come together
[1:27:17] hallelujah
[1:27:18] and then the bonfire gets bigger and
[1:27:19] bigger the atmosphere gets greater and
[1:27:21] greater but you've got to realize that
[1:27:23] same atmosphere is in you
[1:27:25] amen you shouldn't need your favorite
[1:27:27] preacher be screaming at you or your
[1:27:29] favorite song to be playing to feel that
[1:27:31] you can overcome
[1:27:32] hallelujah but that same overcomer
[1:27:34] should be in you if there's no preacher
[1:27:36] screaming no song playing no tape
[1:27:39] playing nothing you can stand on the
[1:27:41] word of god and overcome
[1:27:45] hallelujah that's how we're built
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:50] now notice now the angel
[1:27:52] told them
[1:27:53] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[1:27:56] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:27:58] clothes laying in a manger
[1:28:01] so the angel told them exactly where
[1:28:02] they'd find messiah
[1:28:04] because remember he's he's messiah
[1:28:06] right he's messiah so this is so that so
[1:28:10] the so the believers the shepherds in
[1:28:12] those days they received an angelic
[1:28:14] visitation to point them exactly to
[1:28:17] where messiah was
[1:28:19] now i want you to notice there was one
[1:28:21] angel announcing it to a group of
[1:28:23] shepherds it was a personal message to
[1:28:25] all those shepherds
[1:28:26] it wasn't just for some of them it was
[1:28:29] to all of them
[1:28:30] and it's got to be the same way with you
[1:28:32] and i
[1:28:33] because remember we've received an
[1:28:35] angelic visitation in this day
[1:28:37] not just the seventh angel but the
[1:28:39] revelations 10 1 the mighty angel christ
[1:28:41] himself has come down with an open book
[1:28:44] brother brahm says that the that he says
[1:28:47] in the breach message he says that the
[1:28:49] seventh angel is on earth
[1:28:52] at the time of revelations 10 1 this
[1:28:54] coming right
[1:28:56] so
[1:28:57] but that which is christ himself has
[1:29:00] didn't leave when the prophet left
[1:29:02] right he is here now
[1:29:04] that mighty angel is here fixing things
[1:29:07] for the bride to leave that's why he's
[1:29:10] allowing the world to fall apart you
[1:29:11] know it's not the devil just just
[1:29:13] blowing up stuff and making stuff fail
[1:29:15] no no he thinks he's in control but god
[1:29:18] is in control
[1:29:20] remember the devil has to ask god
[1:29:22] specifically can i do this can i do this
[1:29:25] can i do that he went up before god
[1:29:27] about job
[1:29:29] god began to testify about his servant
[1:29:31] on the earth he's a perfect man
[1:29:33] have you considered job and maybe if yo
[1:29:36] satan was ever honest he'd say no i
[1:29:37] didn't consider him i just walked past
[1:29:40] you know because he looked like anyone
[1:29:41] else but in his heart was a burning
[1:29:43] faith
[1:29:45] amen that you're in jehovah god because
[1:29:47] of the blood of the lamb
[1:29:48] hallelujah and there's a god begins to
[1:29:50] have a testimony service about job you
[1:29:52] know because god will testify about you
[1:29:55] he's not ashamed of you
[1:29:57] god ain't ashamed of you he loves to
[1:29:59] show off his bride
[1:30:01] hallelujah
[1:30:02] satan have you considered these have you
[1:30:04] considered the apple of mine eye
[1:30:06] hallelujah have you considered her she's
[1:30:09] lovely
[1:30:10] i'm proud of her
[1:30:11] hallelujah
[1:30:13] and then the devil says well it's just
[1:30:15] because you protect and do it
[1:30:17] tries to make excuses
[1:30:19] you know and then god says fine
[1:30:21] you can you can do whatever you want
[1:30:23] just don't touch him
[1:30:25] and so what the devil do obeyed what god
[1:30:27] said
[1:30:28] he did exactly what god yo god made him
[1:30:31] boundaries
[1:30:32] he may try to push against the
[1:30:33] boundaries but he couldn't go past the
[1:30:35] boundaries
[1:30:36] you know and then and then the devil's
[1:30:38] defeated and all that because god says
[1:30:40] well god gives lord gives lord takes
[1:30:42] away blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:30:44] then now and then the devil comes up
[1:30:46] before god and god says i told you
[1:30:48] and see the thing is god knew what would
[1:30:50] happen because he knows the future his
[1:30:51] brother isaac preached jesus already
[1:30:52] been in our future and then so here he
[1:30:54] comes back
[1:30:56] and yeah the devil makes more excuses
[1:30:57] well it's just because his health hasn't
[1:30:59] been harmed
[1:31:01] and then so god gives him more
[1:31:03] boundaries
[1:31:04] just don't take his life
[1:31:06] so the devil has to ask permission
[1:31:09] before a trial ever strikes you
[1:31:12] before hardship ever comes trouble in
[1:31:14] the family whatever it may be before it
[1:31:16] ever comes the devil goes to our god
[1:31:19] and gets permission from our god can i
[1:31:22] do this you can only do this he only
[1:31:24] does that can i do that no you can only
[1:31:26] do this
[1:31:27] so before
[1:31:28] trouble ever strikes
[1:31:30] god has to give the devil permission and
[1:31:33] we think the devil's just on a rampage
[1:31:35] it may appear that way but no he's
[1:31:37] following strict instructions
[1:31:40] amen and the prophet tells us when
[1:31:43] trouble strikes it actually shows that
[1:31:45] you have shown god you have found favor
[1:31:48] with god
[1:31:49] that's what he said you found favor with
[1:31:51] god and that's why the trouble strikes
[1:31:54] holy i'm going through a terrible time
[1:31:56] that's just a actually a proof you found
[1:31:58] favor with god i mean god loves you
[1:32:01] hallelujah hey job found favor with god
[1:32:04] and he went through a test
[1:32:07] hallelujah so we can rejoice
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:11] amen
[1:32:12] now so the message of the angel was
[1:32:14] personally to all those shepherds
[1:32:17] and so it wasn't just
[1:32:19] some of the shepherds receiving the
[1:32:21] message
[1:32:22] and then they told the other shippers
[1:32:23] and they all went because you know
[1:32:25] imagine someone's just received an
[1:32:26] imagine being on the hill and you're no
[1:32:28] this is not how the scripture was but
[1:32:30] imagine only one shepherd received the
[1:32:32] angel's message
[1:32:33] and they come all excited messiah's on
[1:32:35] earth
[1:32:36] hallelujah
[1:32:37] an angel just came and you feel the
[1:32:39] presence around them and you know and
[1:32:41] you know
[1:32:42] but
[1:32:43] that could just be some shepherds coming
[1:32:45] under the atmosphere of or of of that
[1:32:48] person
[1:32:49] and you don't want to come under the
[1:32:50] atmosphere of a church
[1:32:53] under the atmosphere of a preacher
[1:32:56] right because it's just that humans
[1:32:58] enthusiasm
[1:33:00] that you begin to follow this is not
[1:33:02] what this is about this is you and god
[1:33:04] right you know we don't want to try and
[1:33:06] put people under our enthusiasm
[1:33:08] because when our enthusiasm may be wayne
[1:33:10] or something
[1:33:12] then what happens is their confidence
[1:33:15] gets knocked because of what we do
[1:33:18] and that person's just following us
[1:33:20] this is not why we want to see people
[1:33:22] come to the lord
[1:33:23] you know if some people are honest they
[1:33:24] say i want to see people come to me
[1:33:28] i want to make disciples of me no that's
[1:33:30] man-made denominationalism
[1:33:32] we are not here to do that we hear that
[1:33:34] people would meet jesus christ
[1:33:36] brother braham said at the end of the
[1:33:37] church book the one thing i want to see
[1:33:39] established is a true spiritual
[1:33:41] relationship between god and man
[1:33:43] that's what he wanted and that's what we
[1:33:45] want
[1:33:46] amen so now
[1:33:48] the message came personally to them and
[1:33:50] then they went
[1:33:51] then they went they didn't just sit
[1:33:52] there on the hill and talk about it they
[1:33:54] went to see where the angels said they
[1:33:56] would find messiah
[1:33:58] hallelujah
[1:34:00] no they went there
[1:34:01] they found the manger
[1:34:03] they saw the messiah hallelujah so now
[1:34:07] notice when they went into the manger
[1:34:10] they did not just find a better way to
[1:34:12] live
[1:34:13] they did not just find some nice people
[1:34:15] in the manger hey joseph and mary would
[1:34:17] be nice people right the shepherds did
[1:34:20] not find a bunch of arguments in a
[1:34:21] manger
[1:34:23] right the shepherds did not just find
[1:34:25] correct doctrine in the manger we know
[1:34:28] the message has restored correct bible
[1:34:29] doctrine
[1:34:30] right but they did not find those things
[1:34:32] in the manger they found messiah in the
[1:34:35] manger right they found the living
[1:34:38] emmanuel god with us the word made flesh
[1:34:41] they found that in the manger now the
[1:34:43] reason i made that list is because what
[1:34:45] you see is what you'll tell others
[1:34:48] right so if you find just a good
[1:34:50] argument in the manger you'll give a
[1:34:52] good argument to people
[1:34:53] if you just fight all these people are
[1:34:55] really nice in the manger you'll tell
[1:34:57] them oh these people are really nice
[1:34:59] right oh oh we have correct bible
[1:35:01] doctrine the bible truth has been
[1:35:02] restored all these things are true but
[1:35:04] if you just see that
[1:35:06] that's what you tell others
[1:35:08] but if you see messiah if you look
[1:35:10] beyond the veil
[1:35:12] i mean if you hear the voice behind the
[1:35:14] voice and the message you don't just
[1:35:15] hear brother brown's voice but you hear
[1:35:17] the voice of the mighty angel himself
[1:35:19] speaking amen then you'll see messiah
[1:35:22] amen because the word is messiah in
[1:35:25] every age
[1:35:26] hallelujah it's not just enough to to
[1:35:29] recognize the historical event of his
[1:35:32] birth death and resurrection though we
[1:35:34] believe in that do we not but you must
[1:35:36] receive it's not to receive messiah in
[1:35:38] history only you must receive him today
[1:35:41] now he is the word he is the true and
[1:35:43] living word
[1:35:45] hallelujah
[1:35:46] no
[1:35:48] we're going to come back to that thought
[1:35:49] but paul
[1:35:51] when he met the lord on the road to
[1:35:53] damascus did not meet an argument
[1:35:56] he did not meet correct doctrine only
[1:35:59] he didn't he didn't just meet a book
[1:36:01] i'll just read the quote brother says in
[1:36:03] an absolute paul didn't always have that
[1:36:05] thai post he used to be tied to the
[1:36:08] group of the pharisees and he had to be
[1:36:11] trained and educated so that they would
[1:36:13] accept them and let him tie himself to
[1:36:15] their post but one day
[1:36:17] he was on the road to damascus and he
[1:36:19] met jesus face to face
[1:36:21] and from there he cut loose of his
[1:36:23] pharisaic thai post and retired himself
[1:36:26] again that jesus who he knowed was
[1:36:29] crucified died and rose again
[1:36:31] paul knew it because he met the person
[1:36:34] that changed him right there he never
[1:36:36] was the same from then on he never met
[1:36:39] he never just met a book
[1:36:42] okay so i could say he never just met a
[1:36:45] message book
[1:36:46] though the truth is in the message
[1:36:48] there's messiah in the word right but he
[1:36:50] didn't just meet a book
[1:36:52] now don't get me wrong that you think
[1:36:54] well we shouldn't give out message books
[1:36:55] give it out
[1:36:57] the word will find the word
[1:36:59] the word will find the bride
[1:37:01] right this message has a life of its own
[1:37:04] right you can give it to someone to be
[1:37:06] passed down down and fall to the hand of
[1:37:08] the elected you know there's a church
[1:37:10] over in australia it was it was founded
[1:37:12] by an aboriginal brother
[1:37:13] and he found the message books and the
[1:37:15] rubbish
[1:37:16] and the dub he picked up started reading
[1:37:18] he got converted
[1:37:19] i think his brother roshan in india that
[1:37:21] i seen the reports through i think he yo
[1:37:23] he received a message book in english
[1:37:24] and he kind of he taught himself english
[1:37:27] to read the book
[1:37:29] it'll get to the elect
[1:37:31] it'll get god knows where his children
[1:37:33] are god knows where you are this morning
[1:37:36] so he never came he never just made a
[1:37:38] book he never just met a creed he met
[1:37:40] the person
[1:37:42] jesus christ who are you lord he said i
[1:37:46] am jesus
[1:37:48] hallelujah
[1:37:49] so that's how when the shepherds went
[1:37:51] into the manger
[1:37:53] they didn't just meet a book
[1:37:55] they met messiah
[1:37:57] amen and because they met messiah
[1:38:00] they could go forth from there and tell
[1:38:03] everyone concerning it says and they
[1:38:05] made known abroad the saying which was
[1:38:07] told them concerning this child so they
[1:38:09] went forth saying
[1:38:11] the angel lord met us in the fields they
[1:38:14] left the sheep there they ran into
[1:38:16] bethlehem i mean they could say
[1:38:18] the angel of the lord told us messiah is
[1:38:20] here on the earth right now and told us
[1:38:23] where we could find him and we've seen
[1:38:25] him and if you go to the same place
[1:38:27] you'll see the same messiah
[1:38:29] hallelujah it's not the same thing if
[1:38:30] you believe the same word you receive
[1:38:32] this message you will see messiah amen
[1:38:35] you will see him alive
[1:38:37] and you
[1:38:38] hallelujah that's what god wants to do
[1:38:40] he wants to fulfill his word in you
[1:38:43] hallelujah
[1:38:45] amen and the shepherds returned
[1:38:47] glorifying and praising god for all the
[1:38:49] things that they had heard and seen and
[1:38:52] it was told unto them now
[1:38:55] the big the big thing though
[1:38:58] if i jump to this
[1:39:00] is the shepherds couldn't take the
[1:39:01] messiah with them
[1:39:03] they didn't you know it wasn't a
[1:39:05] baby stealing
[1:39:07] they couldn't literally take the messiah
[1:39:09] and take him with them
[1:39:11] and go through the street saying look
[1:39:12] i've got messiah
[1:39:14] that may sound ridiculous but of course
[1:39:15] they couldn't they left him in the
[1:39:16] manger so now where messiah was and they
[1:39:19] were became two different places
[1:39:21] and they could just point to where he
[1:39:23] was now it's not the same with you and i
[1:39:26] right
[1:39:27] if you only see a bunch of books and
[1:39:29] tapes and a prophet's ministry in the
[1:39:31] manger then that's what you will do
[1:39:33] you'll say go see this but if you've
[1:39:35] really seen the babe i really see the
[1:39:37] messiah because we know he's not a babe
[1:39:38] in a manger anymore he's a resurrected
[1:39:40] lord jesus christ he uses his word right
[1:39:42] but if you've really seen him i mean
[1:39:45] then you will take him with you
[1:39:47] hallelujah that because why because he
[1:39:49] becomes incarnate in you
[1:39:52] hallelujah that now where you go and you
[1:39:53] begin to testify that jesus christ is
[1:39:56] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:39:58] tomb is empty not because he's not a
[1:39:59] body in it but because jesus christ is
[1:40:01] alive today i mean i've met him i where
[1:40:04] the angel told me i would see him in his
[1:40:06] word i mean i've met that resurrected
[1:40:08] messiah and now he's living in me and
[1:40:10] now i can be a true testimony
[1:40:13] hallelujah
[1:40:15] and then now the life you live is a
[1:40:16] vindication of what you're saying is the
[1:40:18] truth
[1:40:20] hallelujah i mean so we're not so so the
[1:40:23] shepherds couldn't take the messiah with
[1:40:25] them but now in the end time
[1:40:28] we are
[1:40:29] we do
[1:40:33] amen can i have scripture for that
[1:40:34] please okay second corinthians 6 and 15
[1:40:38] and what concord hath christ with belail
[1:40:41] or what part hath he that believeth with
[1:40:43] an infidel
[1:40:44] and what agreement hath the temple of
[1:40:46] god with idols for ye are the temple of
[1:40:49] the living god as god has said i will
[1:40:51] dwell in them
[1:40:52] and walk in them that's what he wants to
[1:40:55] do this is why you're here i want to i
[1:40:57] want to walk in them
[1:40:58] where they walk i'm going to walk where
[1:41:00] they go i'm going to go hallelujah
[1:41:02] hallelujah you wake up in the morning
[1:41:04] he's walking
[1:41:06] amen you go to school he's there you go
[1:41:08] to your job site he's there
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:12] hallelujah
[1:41:13] and i'll be their god and they shall be
[1:41:15] my people
[1:41:16] you want identity politics people want
[1:41:18] an identity in this end time amen we
[1:41:20] have an identity in the word
[1:41:23] hallelujah
[1:41:25] amen they shall be my people wherefore
[1:41:27] come out from among them be separate
[1:41:29] saith the lord touch not the unclean
[1:41:31] thing and i will receive you and will be
[1:41:33] a father unto you and you shall be my
[1:41:34] sons and daughters saith the almighty
[1:41:38] amen after the lord gave the
[1:41:40] instructions of mark 16 which is the
[1:41:42] general orders of the church amen these
[1:41:44] signs shall follow them that believe and
[1:41:46] after he listed that all off he says in
[1:41:48] verse 20 he says and they went forth and
[1:41:50] preached everywhere the lord working
[1:41:52] with them and confirming the word with
[1:41:54] signs following amen
[1:41:57] so where they went the messiah went too
[1:41:59] because the messiah was in them
[1:42:01] hallelujah and that's to be the same
[1:42:03] thing with you and i you know this world
[1:42:04] is anointed
[1:42:06] the whole world is anointed
[1:42:08] amen and we know that you know the
[1:42:10] prophecies but the rain falls on the
[1:42:12] scriptures the rain falls on the just
[1:42:13] and the unjust the rain is for the just
[1:42:16] so it doesn't matter what the church
[1:42:18] world does with the anointing i'm not
[1:42:20] interested in that
[1:42:22] they can do what they do i try to i pray
[1:42:24] they give their lives to the word not to
[1:42:26] a church crete and they rarely give
[1:42:28] themselves over to him but the rain is
[1:42:31] for the believer
[1:42:32] to bring us to maturity
[1:42:34] amen to bring us into the full
[1:42:36] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:42:39] so you'll be anointed with something in
[1:42:40] the end time either with this world
[1:42:43] religious spirit antichrist spirit or
[1:42:46] the spirit of god
[1:42:47] i want to be anointed with the spirit of
[1:42:49] god
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:52] now
[1:42:53] brother brahm says this in the trial
[1:42:55] 1964 this is the 19th of the 4th 1964.
[1:43:00] and you know how the court trial um
[1:43:02] sermons work
[1:43:03] right that you know you know people have
[1:43:04] to stand mr skeptic unbeliever mr
[1:43:06] impatient and then believers come along
[1:43:08] and then brother brown moyes takes the
[1:43:10] stand
[1:43:11] and and and what is on trial is the word
[1:43:14] of god
[1:43:15] and he comes down to the end and he's
[1:43:17] referring to
[1:43:19] that at the promise of this day is
[1:43:20] malachi 4 being fulfilled luke 17 30
[1:43:24] being fulfilled which is the son of man
[1:43:25] being revealed again which is jesus
[1:43:27] christ and also john 14 12
[1:43:30] being fulfilled
[1:43:32] he says i'm a stranger
[1:43:33] and i'm only being record of what the
[1:43:36] bible says to be truth if you notice the
[1:43:38] angel of the lord that came down in the
[1:43:40] form of a man had his back turned to the
[1:43:43] tent and he told abraham what sarah was
[1:43:46] thinking jesus said it would repeat now
[1:43:48] if i've told you the truth
[1:43:50] let god confirm
[1:43:53] that to be the truth let him reveal it
[1:43:55] then it's no secret you know then
[1:43:58] i'll leave this court this afternoon
[1:44:00] with this verdict to make in your own
[1:44:02] mind let the god that made the promise
[1:44:05] not back in them days they were
[1:44:06] vindicated like the god that made the
[1:44:09] promise vindicated today

[1:44:22] standing exactly on what the scripture
[1:44:25] says i want this court to see that he's
[1:44:28] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:44:30] that he keeps his promise and he

[1:46:28] i'm a stranger to you and don't know you
[1:46:30] what is it the fulfilling of the word of
[1:46:32] god in the last days prosecutor i want
[1:46:36] you to know that the word of god is true
[1:46:38] god told me that 33 years ago i've
[1:46:41] waited all this time but it's fulfilled
[1:46:43] right here this afternoon god keeps his
[1:46:46] word he's the same yesterday today and
[1:46:48] forever god bless you go and get your
[1:46:50] desire now so what he is declaring is
[1:46:53] the promises of malachi 4 luke 17 30. i
[1:46:56] mean john john 14 12 and others are
[1:46:58] fulfilled right here this afternoon
[1:47:02] hallelujah now if we could really see
[1:47:05] because what the angel said there to the
[1:47:07] shepherds is you will see the
[1:47:08] fulfillment of god's word
[1:47:10] this is where you'll find it
[1:47:12] and they went there they saw messiah
[1:47:14] then they broadcast it everywhere they
[1:47:16] went their lives were changed because of
[1:47:18] that angelic visitation
[1:47:20] and and the prophet is saying here back
[1:47:22] in 1964 that these scriptures that have
[1:47:25] been laying in the word maybe up to a
[1:47:27] thousands of years have been fulfilled
[1:47:30] right now
[1:47:31] and so now and so he's telling you that
[1:47:33] because god wants you to see this is
[1:47:35] more than healing this is more than
[1:47:37] discernment this is me the son of man
[1:47:40] jesus christ being revealed again
[1:47:43] this is messiah being declared this is
[1:47:46] not a church system this is not a
[1:47:48] movement this is god himself being made
[1:47:50] known hallelujah and the true shepherds
[1:47:52] that receive the angelic message amen go
[1:47:56] to where they're going to that word and
[1:47:58] they see messiah
[1:48:00] hallelujah now as i said before the
[1:48:02] shepherds could not take the messiah
[1:48:04] with them but we take him with us
[1:48:07] now if you look at the nature of the
[1:48:08] messiah he has the nature of a lamb
[1:48:10] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[1:48:12] the sin of the world i mean so now if
[1:48:14] you take the messiah with you you'll
[1:48:16] become like the messiah
[1:48:18] because two of you can't live in the
[1:48:20] same house
[1:48:21] brother brahm says i cannot be alive and
[1:48:23] god alive in me at the same time
[1:48:26] i mean just like if beethoven lived in
[1:48:28] me i would write great music it can't be
[1:48:30] me and beethoven in the same place
[1:48:33] right so the apostle paul said you're
[1:48:35] gonna reckon yourself dead
[1:48:36] christ is alive and you the life i now
[1:48:39] live it's not i that liveth yet i'm
[1:48:41] alive right but it's christ that liveth
[1:48:43] in me
[1:48:44] i mean so now the nature of the messiah
[1:48:46] if you're really if you're really a
[1:48:48] shepherd who's a shepherd
[1:48:50] who's a shepherd on the hill of
[1:48:51] bethlehem
[1:48:52] amen if you really if you really have
[1:48:54] looked into the message and seen messiah
[1:48:57] then you become one with him remember
[1:49:00] the scripture says many as received him
[1:49:02] gave you power to become the sons of god
[1:49:04] so if you really receive messiah
[1:49:06] are you following me i trust this is not
[1:49:09] mental gymnastics
[1:49:11] you become one with your sacrifice just
[1:49:13] like brother brown would say who died
[1:49:15] for you on calvary did a church die for
[1:49:17] you did a denomination die if you no the
[1:49:19] word died for you jesus christ the word
[1:49:22] but but whatever your sacrifice is
[1:49:24] that's what you become one with so if
[1:49:26] this church became if this church is
[1:49:28] your sacrifice
[1:49:30] i pray it's not
[1:49:32] even you know this is this should not be
[1:49:33] your absolute
[1:49:36] this is our absolute
[1:49:39] right
[1:49:40] so if the church is your sacrifice what
[1:49:42] you believe god gave you to have peace
[1:49:45] with him
[1:49:46] then you'll be a most miserable person
[1:49:48] at the end but you'll become
[1:49:50] like the church
[1:49:51] right or a system of creeds or dogmas
[1:49:53] whatever it may be but if you've really
[1:49:55] received messiah
[1:49:57] amen you'll become if he's really your
[1:50:00] sacrifice you'll become like him
[1:50:02] why because his life comes into you by
[1:50:04] the baptism of the holy ghost i mean to
[1:50:06] his nature now is your nature
[1:50:09] his ways become your ways it's not our
[1:50:11] ways anymore we can't live we can't be
[1:50:14] lord of our own lives and he be our lord
[1:50:16] too
[1:50:17] and then so and then how is it how is he
[1:50:20] our lord he makes our choices
[1:50:22] right if you make your own choices
[1:50:24] you're still in charge
[1:50:26] i've got a right to ball that person out
[1:50:28] hold on
[1:50:30] i've got a right to hold this this
[1:50:31] person wronged me here hold on
[1:50:34] hold on what did jesus do we want to be
[1:50:36] like jesus
[1:50:38] oh but i'm justified in doing this he
[1:50:40] was real justified
[1:50:42] he could have been real justified and
[1:50:43] just wiping the whole place out
[1:50:47] but his nature comes into us
[1:50:49] hallelujah and that's how you know
[1:50:52] see now this is actually a trial
[1:50:55] you've got to examine your own life by
[1:50:57] the holy ghost
[1:50:59] have you really met messiah
[1:51:01] have you really met him or have you just
[1:51:04] met a culture how i was born this is how
[1:51:06] i was raised as my mode of living a
[1:51:09] bunch of arguments a bunch of doctrines
[1:51:11] have you just met a prophet
[1:51:14] that's the biggest indebtedness you
[1:51:16] could do to his message be caught up in
[1:51:18] brother brown brother brown did this and
[1:51:20] brother and he did this and this miracle
[1:51:22] happened here that's all very good but
[1:51:24] is he living in you see the biggest
[1:51:26] problem with denomination is god lived
[1:51:28] in the founder you read about john
[1:51:29] wesley martin luther different ones
[1:51:32] supernatural was living in the founder
[1:51:34] but then the next generation comes along
[1:51:36] and they can just point back god lived
[1:51:37] in the founder
[1:51:39] we are not called there's that cycle
[1:51:41] that's a cycle of revival and death
[1:51:44] and that cycle is meant to be destroyed
[1:51:46] in this day and it's a bunch of
[1:51:48] individuals amen that will break that
[1:51:50] cycle god they'll allow god to live in
[1:51:52] them
[1:51:53] hallelujah you think about the shepherds
[1:51:55] on the field i mean when they met
[1:51:57] messiah their lives are different
[1:52:00] totally transformed you couldn't go back
[1:52:03] and be having the same kind of
[1:52:04] conversations the same kind of life i
[1:52:06] mean after after having that happen to
[1:52:08] you
[1:52:09] hallelujah you'd be a different person
[1:52:11] and that's just seeing him in a manger
[1:52:13] how much more of those that god lives in
[1:52:16] by the blood of jesus christ how much
[1:52:18] more those have been transformed
[1:52:20] by the power of the blood that is holy
[1:52:22] ghost now we see in our own lives his
[1:52:24] word expressing
[1:52:26] how can that become common to us
[1:52:29] hallelujah but what have you seen in the
[1:52:31] manger
[1:52:32] your life dictate actually proves you
[1:52:34] can say well i've seen this and you can
[1:52:35] rattle off you know this message is not
[1:52:38] a creed
[1:52:39] you know the lots of churches have the
[1:52:41] apostles creed and we say what donson
[1:52:43] said is
[1:52:44] but people make this message of creed
[1:52:47] i believe brother i believe brother
[1:52:49] brahma is the prophet of god for the
[1:52:50] ladies and church age i believe all the
[1:52:52] seven seals are open i believe all the
[1:52:53] mysteries of the god you know i believe
[1:52:54] god is one manifested different ways and
[1:52:56] they can you can rattle off till the
[1:52:58] cows come home that doesn't help
[1:53:00] it's the life of god and i'll tell you
[1:53:02] the life of god is expressed when we put
[1:53:04] under pressure
[1:53:06] it's not when everything's going well
[1:53:07] it's when pressure comes down when you
[1:53:09] squeeze a lemon
[1:53:11] you prove what's in the lemon it can
[1:53:13] look all fine on the outside who's ever
[1:53:16] seen fruit where something's basically
[1:53:18] just hollowed the thing out
[1:53:20] and you crush it and there's just powder
[1:53:21] there's nothing in it who's ever seen
[1:53:22] that kind of thing
[1:53:24] when no pressure is applied it can look
[1:53:26] like a perfect apple or whatever but
[1:53:28] when pressure comes in then what's the
[1:53:30] life that's in it is squeezed out
[1:53:32] what life is being squeezed out of you
[1:53:34] and i
[1:53:35] is it carnality wrapped up in some
[1:53:37] religious terms
[1:53:39] see we've got to take off the religious
[1:53:42] mask
[1:53:44] we do we can't wear it
[1:53:46] we can't be impersonators
[1:53:48] you know we've got to be genuine
[1:53:51] if we're struggling we're struggling
[1:53:53] call out for help
[1:53:55] if you're doing well praise the lord
[1:53:57] don't look at our inward you know jonah
[1:53:59] looked he could have sat there until he
[1:54:02] was digested and looked at his own
[1:54:04] problem
[1:54:05] he could have sat
[1:54:06] there but he made a choice
[1:54:10] i'm going to look by faith towards your
[1:54:12] holy temple now can you can you someone
[1:54:15] explain because remember solomon prayed
[1:54:17] lord if anyone looks towards this holy
[1:54:18] temple you'll hear them
[1:54:20] can you explain to me
[1:54:22] he's in the bottom of the sea
[1:54:24] i don't know
[1:54:25] he's probably struggling to find
[1:54:27] whatever way is up
[1:54:29] how could he possibly say oh jerusalem's
[1:54:31] that way
[1:54:33] you know how could he do it
[1:54:35] but he by faith
[1:54:37] said i'm gonna look i'm not gonna look
[1:54:39] at this is lying vanity he's pressing in
[1:54:41] me on every hand
[1:54:42] but i'm gonna look beyond my
[1:54:44] circumstance that's why i'm gonna look
[1:54:46] beyond i have this you know all the
[1:54:49] troubles and things we face you know the
[1:54:50] devil loves to make us feel alone
[1:54:54] he wants us to think that god doesn't
[1:54:56] care that god's not interested and we
[1:54:58] just got stuck in this way and these
[1:54:59] people aren't really that you know they
[1:55:01] don't care about me and this is my
[1:55:03] problem there's all these things and god
[1:55:05] has allowed trouble to come in because
[1:55:07] god wants to reveal himself in that
[1:55:09] trouble
[1:55:10] but if we just keep observing lying
[1:55:12] vanities we'll just keep being digested
[1:55:15] by it it'll lead us up
[1:55:17] not here to be fish food
[1:55:20] i'm not here to be fish food for my
[1:55:22] whatever's going on in my life i don't
[1:55:23] have it all together
[1:55:26] you know where maybe i i should what's
[1:55:28] the time
[1:55:29] i just finished with this you know sheep
[1:55:31] are always sheep
[1:55:34] they can be we were driving up to the
[1:55:35] wedding we saw a whole bunch of lambs
[1:55:37] some were a few i don't know how old but
[1:55:39] they are little things
[1:55:40] but there was mama she's a sheep
[1:55:43] mama
[1:55:44] all the she or the lamb they need a
[1:55:46] shepherd
[1:55:48] they can be the oldest biggest mature
[1:55:50] one in the herd
[1:55:52] still sheep
[1:55:53] god has never made us to think now we
[1:55:56] have it all together and everything's
[1:55:57] fine and we don't need him he is our
[1:56:00] shepherd
[1:56:01] we always need a shepherd
[1:56:05] i've been in the message 10 billion
[1:56:07] years you still need a shepherd
[1:56:09] i can trace my natural lineage back to
[1:56:11] adam you still need to ship it
[1:56:13] i've never done a single thing wrong in
[1:56:14] my life you still need a shepherd
[1:56:16] amen and really we're born in sin anyway
[1:56:19] but see we'll always have time in life
[1:56:22] where we need him
[1:56:24] someone who knows all the answers has it
[1:56:25] all together there's actually something
[1:56:27] wrong with that person
[1:56:29] because now they are
[1:56:31] i am self-existing
[1:56:33] i don't need god because i have it all i
[1:56:35] know the quotes i know everything to do
[1:56:36] i know everything how it should be and
[1:56:38] no no that is
[1:56:40] we're not built to be that way
[1:56:42] we're built to always need him
[1:56:46] amen and that's why you could say the
[1:56:48] shepherds
[1:56:49] had that same nature because they were
[1:56:51] shepherds they could see find the chief
[1:56:53] shepherd
[1:56:54] and they weren't too proud to to lower
[1:56:56] themselves to where he was born because
[1:56:58] that was a natural place for a shepherd
[1:57:00] to be
[1:57:02] see zacchaeus went up a tree
[1:57:04] and he was looking judgmentally down on
[1:57:06] jesus
[1:57:08] but when jesus came to him and saw him
[1:57:10] hiding in that tree he said no no you're
[1:57:12] looking at me the wrong way
[1:57:14] because zach jesus knew where zacchaeus
[1:57:17] was
[1:57:18] he didn't see a foot sticking out of a
[1:57:19] branch and say odd zacchaeus
[1:57:22] no he knew he was there
[1:57:24] maybe he just walked along and just
[1:57:26] cried out zacchaeus didn't even look up
[1:57:27] at first
[1:57:28] but then zacchaeus was looking the wrong
[1:57:30] way at the word
[1:57:32] i don't agree with this this doesn't fit
[1:57:35] my belief system this is not right this
[1:57:38] is not according to social standing this
[1:57:40] is contrary to we've progressed what's
[1:57:42] that being up in a sycamore tree looking
[1:57:44] down at the word
[1:57:45] but you can never receive messiah
[1:57:48] if it it's not compatible with your
[1:57:50] belief system our belief system when
[1:57:53] we're born is wrong
[1:57:55] because we're born in sin
[1:57:57] shaped an iniquity come to the world
[1:57:58] speaking lies we're full of unbelief
[1:58:00] that's just putting a few scriptures
[1:58:01] together right
[1:58:03] so our belief system is wrong we are not
[1:58:06] called to make the message be compatible
[1:58:09] with our belief system we're here to die
[1:58:11] to ourselves and let and and receive the
[1:58:14] mind of christ
[1:58:15] that he becomes our belief system not by
[1:58:18] well i'll take this i won't take this i
[1:58:19] like this bit i don't like that no
[1:58:21] that's what zacchaeus was he was looking
[1:58:22] condescendingly down upon the word but
[1:58:25] because jesus knew that salvation was
[1:58:26] going to come to his house says
[1:58:28] zacchaeus but zacchaeus you can't look
[1:58:30] at me up there you can't look down
[1:58:32] you've got to come down here
[1:58:34] and zacchaeus was the shortest man in
[1:58:36] the
[1:58:37] lowest city
[1:58:38] and when he came down and he looked up
[1:58:40] at the word in a place of humility
[1:58:43] then he began to realize
[1:58:46] i can't where i was was wrong and
[1:58:49] they're just coming into the prince of
[1:58:50] the lord he says lord i'm going to make
[1:58:52] these things right
[1:58:54] what happened he saw messiah
[1:58:58] and he and the messiah came into his
[1:59:00] house and changed his whole life
[1:59:02] and that's how you know i'm just going
[1:59:03] to finish with this that's how you know
[1:59:04] you've really seen him
[1:59:06] he comes into your house he's in this
[1:59:08] house death hath to flee now there is
[1:59:11] life
[1:59:12] amen where darkness used to be
[1:59:14] hallelujah when you've really seen him
[1:59:17] like the shepherds
[1:59:18] we've seen messiah on this day
[1:59:20] no one told you god told you you'll find
[1:59:22] him here
[1:59:23] the angel will lead you here to the word
[1:59:26] hallelujah it changes your whole life
[1:59:28] but if you just see a prophet's ministry
[1:59:31] if you just see healing if you just see
[1:59:33] a group of nice people or a good
[1:59:34] argument
[1:59:36] you're missing the eternal life part
[1:59:38] you can look the part
[1:59:40] but it's the life as brother paul saying
[1:59:42] on wednesday what life are we living
[1:59:44] every day
[1:59:46] how we treat each other how we treat our
[1:59:47] children how we treat our spouse how we
[1:59:49] treat people on the work side how we
[1:59:51] treat our boss how we you know
[1:59:53] because christianity is every day
[1:59:56] not just tend tintel whatever on here on
[1:59:58] a wednesday and whenever no every day
[2:00:02] amen
[2:00:04] so let's finish there
[2:00:05] we have the musicians please this
[2:00:07] morning
[2:00:19] amen
[2:00:22] let's down to our feet shall we
[2:00:28] i mean this bow heads in a word of
[2:00:29] prayer if anyone want to be remembered
[2:00:31] and pray say brother ben
[2:00:34] i don't know if i've seen him
[2:00:38] got to be remembered in prayer your last
[2:00:40] side
[2:00:42] they saw messiah i wish i could convey
[2:00:45] it in words
[2:00:47] we see messiah on this day in the word
[2:00:49] of god in this message
[2:00:51] and those who have truly seen him in the
[2:00:53] word they become that word
[2:00:55] they become the living bible
[2:00:58] lord
[2:00:59] oh lord jesus
[2:01:01] father you see all the hands that are
[2:01:03] raised
[2:01:04] i pray father you touch each one

[2:01:12] father i pray dear god that you would
[2:01:14] touch each life here lord that we could
[2:01:16] look back on our lives and we could
[2:01:18] truly say

[2:01:22] maybe through a tape
[2:01:24] and maybe through a preacher and maybe
[2:01:26] just reading the bible maybe through a
[2:01:28] song
[2:01:29] but i heard a voice from heaven
[2:01:32] and and that voice told me where i'd
[2:01:33] meet
[2:01:34] you and lord jesus we came to you lord
[2:01:38] through your word we found you in your
[2:01:40] word and you look we gave our lives
