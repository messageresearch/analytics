TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord hello welcome to church this morning amen it's good to be here it's good to see all of you see your smiling faces amen I I so we had I I just you know when you get up here you just talk a bit to kind of capture the atmosphere and like see how people are doing and it's like you got to warm up you know when you when you in the winter when you apparently with a diesel you kind of diesel vehicle you've got to just sort of switch it on and leave it running for like five or 10 minutes before you drive the thing you know cuz it's got to all sort of warm up so we're just going to you know if you wonder why I come up here and just start talking a bit and just kind [Music] of sometimes blabber on it's like it's actually very spiritual [Laughter] so um yeah yeah yeah yeah so so no so we had the we had the communion on Wednesday was who was here on Wednesday and um I was sitting down I was thinking you know I always dragg the children up with me to do communion and things I said uh I said to the children you know what you guys go out by yourself you know this is more a personal thing you you got just I thought that not that I'm right or wrong or anything I just thought you guys you always come up with me but you know when you when you serve the Lord you got to it's you and the Lord you know it's between you and God you go you you that's just something I thought I was like so you just got by yourself I'm just going to go up when I want to go up but little did I realize I was breaking tradition man you know cuz like we have a very nice tradition here where we you know we all got with the family you know so the father and the mother and all the children and toe come up and then you know it's a very nice tradition it's and I I like it but you know it's a it's a it is a tradition if you if you'd be honest about it you know cuz the Bible says that every man you know examine himself and you know it's it's your own personal thing it's not like oh how I'll examine you child you know how you're doing it's like no you got to go and meet God yourself you're the one you die tonight you it's you and the Lord I'm not there to help you you the Lord's crossing over with you my faith can help you but that's as far as my ability to help you goes is my faith you know and I know there's a bit more to it but yeah so we were driving home and the children were like cuz I came up by myself and then there was a straggling of others and the the children were like Dad you shouldn't have done that they're all going to think we're having a big dispute in the family and you're going up by yourself and so you know it goes to show the power of tradition sometimes you know oh and and I I thought you know some of the people that had to even follow Jesus they had to really break with some tradition and some very powerful ways that families did things in that and someone in the family had to say no um uh I won't be at the synagogue today I'm actually going out in the field to listen to this other man and it was a they were they had to fight against this well no that's not who's this guy we do this this is the way we've always done it what are you doing who's this you know so but I thank God that you know we yeah we don't do things here out of a tradition we do things out of a love for God and we we follow the lord the way that the Lord calls us to do it so I don't know why I said that but I was just how are you all doing you're doing good good okay let's stand and let's open in prayer let's praise the Lord this morning I think

Furniture status it's great amen so God bless you amen so love you all appreciate you all amen everyone else amen God bless you Sister Kay thank you good to have you here too God bless you amen let's uh go to the scripture uh this morning we to go to uh Psalms 119 and um it's got a got a a a small thought this morning um let's just read this verse here so Psalms 119 and vers 89 down to 93 here halfway through school holidays 50% there the older ones are rejoicing the younger ones are lamenting but hey we'll get through it amen some 1989 you can take that however you want to I don't know any who so this is uh say it says here forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou Hast established the Earth and it abideth they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants unless thy law had been my Delights I should have perished in mine Affliction I will never forget thy precepts for with them thou Hast quickened me glory to God Amen um let's just Bowe in a word of prayer this morning amen if you have a need just want to slip your hand before the Lord amen gracious Lord we're so thankful that we can come into your presence that we don't worship an idea Lord or a religion we worship the true and living God the Lord Jesus Christ and we are asking dear God you come down in our midst in a very special way may you touch all of our hearts may you speak to our lives Lord God we need you to pour yourself into us more and more and we are just so thankful you have quickened us by Your Word Lord we are so thankful Lord just want to pray dear God for all those who couldn't be here today we think of Sister Barbara dear God and others who are not well I pray father Bailey family Lord I just ask that you would be everyone's portion Lord if they be streaming May you may your presence be with them because you said to us all you'd never leave us nor forsake us no matter where we are may you be their portion and Lord may you just have preeminence in the service we surrender Our Lives into hands may your blood cover us all oh God and may you have the preeminence For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I have this thought um and it's Heaven Knows hell knows do you Hallelujah that's the question so Heaven Knows hell knows do you amen cuz that's really the thing if you know like heaven knows and hell knows Hallelujah you're going to have a glorious walk amen so we read here in Psalms 10 19 here that you know the word of God is settled uh in heaven I mean forever so it's done in God's mind his word is true it works in every circumstance in every situation it works there's not a variable there's no there's no sub Clauses or variables where God says it cannot work it can work in to all places all generations all situations God word is true it's all powerful you know it can do what it wants to do amen so we got to realize that God knows this amen God knows because he is his word God knows his word Works amen cuz he said let there be sun moon and stars and you go out at night maybe you can see one star because of the street lights maybe you can see the whole whole milky white way I don't know but God said let there be and it's amazing in the book of gener um Genesis it says and he made this Heaven um um heavens and you know Heavens also just like a side note like God made all the creation he said oh and I made that too by the way you know so God can do anything his word is all powerful now we're going to realize that the devil doesn't have the keys to his own house this morning he's defeated you know he knows what happened that day on Calvary he felt the impact of it you know one event can cause some people to Rejoice the same event can cause other people to mourn like you know when the All Blacks lose another world cup it makes our GDP go down domestic violence go up trouble happens but the other team's rejoicing saying we won so the same event can cause rioting or it can cause rejoicing it depends what side you're on Amen so I don't believe we're on Hell's side today I believe we on side today amen so hell knows that it doesn't have Satan remembered the moment where the Lord Jesus stepped into hell he remembered the moment that feeling he got that finally I've got you you know he said to the Lord Jesus I thought I had you when I had Abel I thought I had you when I had Noah I thought I had you when I had Moses I thought I had you when I had John the Baptist but finally you're here and maybe he just was gloating and think oh he's going to enjoy this but really the one who was going to enjoy it was the Lord Jesus amen because Jesus said no Satan my blood's on the cross amen I have redeemed Adam's Fallen race I have redeemed this Earth I'm in charge I'm the boss now give me the keys I H death in the grave he boots Satan back down to how he slams the door behind him and walks up triumphant amen so Satan knows the day he lost his keys and he's not guessing where he lost him he knows we lose our keys we got to kind of go down a memory lane and try and find them and eventually hopefully we do he doesn't Satan doesn't need to try and remember he knows because that moment so impacted his life he's never the same death is never the same hell's never been the same amen and so hell knows it Heaven Knows It Hallelujah do you hallelujah hallelujah you know it says here in Revelations 12 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the Dragon for and his angels and prevailed not hell knows this I I'm just going to go through some things today because because it's when we don't know like heaven knows then fear comes in we try to operate in a humanistic realm and that's where trouble comes but if we can receive revelation we can know like God knows amen that his word is true his word is powerful he's more than enough and every trial we'll stand on his word we won't try and use our five senses to work things out we won't try and you know work things out with our mind see the world is trying to work out how to fix the world oh my that's going really well isn't it that's working out real good for them this place is going to be smoke bombs and craters and Chaos cuz they're trying to work out how it's going to go humanistically see but if they could just see into the word of God how things should be handled oh boy won't be no trouble you know I heard brother Bram this morning saying you know a holy ghost filled camp meeting is more has more power for a nation than all the atomic bombs that Nation can make for million years amen that's what he said amen so the so the anointed of God being in a country amen can do more for that country amen than than all the weapons that that anyone could ever devise I say an anointed son of of God in a family I mean can do more for that family than all the counseling all the self out books all the humanistic things am mean the anointing of God in that family will do far more than anything else you see so now so the devil fought and he lost and he prevailed not neither was there any uh their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him amen and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ isn't it isn't it strange the devil's cast out into the Earth but now here comes this voice saying now has come power to the people of God hallelujah because when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord says I'll raise up a standard he'll make his promises more alive more real more tangible amen praise the Lord amen so for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him this is where you step in and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and they love that not their lives un the death amen this is what heaven knows but do you know it this is how you overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony what should your testimony be God's word is true I believe the word amen irrespective of how I'm feeling what I'm going through the Mind battles the troubles whatever no God's word I'm going to confess God's word not going to confess my situation I'm not going to uh no I'm not denying my situation right we're not ostriches that have ostrich faith and just put their head in the sand right we're not those kind of a people we see the enemy for what he is and what he does like brother Bram says and how can I overcome he says you know it's like you've got cancer you really have cancer you can't deny it you've got it but greater is he that's in you that's already conquered that cancer than that cancer right so that's how you overcome you don't put blinkers on you don't deny things and walk around like this you say yes the enemy is there but my God is greater than that enemy I don't need to fear him because my God has already overcome this enemy hallelujah hallelujah amenu therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto having great wrath he doesn't have great joy he's angry he's got great wrath he's got great hatred great great anger because he knoweth he has but a short time so heaven knows that the expired date of the devil is now Satan knows it himself he sees his barcode he sees the expiry date he he's come to his end see you could think now he's come down he's God of this evil age you think he'd have great joy now I'm a now I'm King no he's has great wrath because he knows the one that kicked him out of Heaven pursued him down upon the Earth amen so so heaven so Satan knows he lost in heaven he's going to lose on the Earth right heaven knows that Satan lost in heaven he's going to lose upon the Earth but what about you now when this battle falls on human beings now falls on you and I do we know what side we're on do we know the power of the side we're on Amen so the devil has great wrath amen he is angry he is troubled amen now as I said before you know one event can can can cause people to react different ways see thou believest there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and TR they're troubled this all powerful being the supreme god they believe in him too but it doesn't give them Joy it doesn't give them love it doesn't give them peace it doesn't give them satisfaction it doesn't give them Comfort no it makes them tremble it makes them afraid amen because they know this great one that conquered them in heaven is going to conquer them on the earth amen and because our lord Jesus has already conquered hell death in the grave amen this is just you know this is just they know it's coming the devil knows he's got it coming to him yes amen we know we've got Glory coming to us amen hallelujah so it's so important that we that we realize you know that we think and know like heaven knows remember if the devil was uh you know spoke the truth and nothing but the truth he' say yeah I'm going to lose he reads the same script you do he reads the same script he reads the end of the book He studies it he's trying to find a loophole trying to find a way in and he's tried every loophole he can to try and get into the bride of Christ but he can't get in I mean because the blood of Jesus Christ has sealed him out I mean the anointing of God has sealed him out amen so he's trying to find a loophole but he just can't get it he searches and he tries he's got all these schemes and all these things so he thinks in his in his deluded mind somehow he can win but if he was truthful he' say no I can't win right you know Hitler had great delusions of grandure uh when when when when the when the Soviets were coming and you know the Americans and the allies landed in Normandy you know he had plans to rebuild Berlin he had these big models built of this great big Metropolis he was going to build he had this delusions of grandeur we're going to win this thing we're going to turn this thing around his generals knew they knew if the Allies ever got a beach hit in Normandy that was the war that's it but they fought like they were going to win the Nazis but they knew they were going to lose the devil know he's got delusions of grandeur I'm going to have a I'm going to have an eternal Kingdom I'm going to build my my kingdom I'm going to be like the most high and all these things I'm going to have a you know Kingdom better than God's kingdom he's got all these models set out but yet if his generals really told him the truth and he really realized the truth he no no we've lost this thing we've lost this thing you know but you see the devil never go he doesn't have Revelation he has calculations and thoughts and ideas and planning it but he doesn't have Revelation because if you really walk like God walked you know the end from the beginning amen and God wants us to walk like that in this world he wants us to walk by Revelation not by humanistic ideas not not by calculations and projections of this is how I think this will happen and this and this no you got to walk by Revelation amen because if you walk by Revelation that's the only thing that has prevailing power against the enemy it's not us in our two Ines of gray matter trying to work out how to beat them and how to defeat him because even the Christian world today they think we have to somehow outsmart the devil to not take the Ark of the Beast and go in rapture we don't have to outsmart the devil our lord Jesus already conquered him we surrender to the word of God and God gets us there amen this is not something where you know like an escape room or something you got to try and you know work it out and how can I escape this scenario no surrender to the Lord Jesus and he'll get you out of the scenario amen but you see the devil wants us to think like him yeah that's right that's what he wants us to do he wants us to uh because he he knows the power of Revelation he's he's felt the effects of it Jesus said no man takes my life I lay it down and I'll pick it back up again he heard those words he saw it happen yeah Glory he Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life you know and and the devil anointed all the you know the mourners to go with Mary and Martha try and put some unbelief into their house and try and keep the promise coming but Jesus came their way anyway called them out amen where where Martha went to Mary said the master call your comes and cth for thee took her out that you unbelieving atmosphere of your know this your pity parties and all these things took took her out of that and then Jesus spoke to her faith came back yes Lord you can do it right now amen where'd you lay him Hallelujah went to the Grave Jesus wept because humanly he was he was hurting cuz his friends were hurting amen cuz you when he wept he was a man but when he said Lazarus come forth amen if he didn't speak Lazarus by name there would have been a general Resurrection Hallelujah why cuz he's the resurrection in the life amen hallelujah so so the devil has felt the effects of Revelation amen he felt the effects in the prophets meetings where where where God gave him Revelation in the cave by the angel of the Lord amen if you get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer and night after night meeting after meeting demons were cast out demons ran for the hills I think it was Billy Andrews um um who who became a Believer but but he was an evangelist and brother time and you know he could see demons in meetings and he was up on the balcony first meeting he ever went to and you know um you know he's just watching the service and and he saw brother BR come in the side they on the platform not even say a word just come and take off his hat and he said demon started running for the hills amen he saw that he saw man this is this is different see because the devil believes and trembles he is he has felt the impact of Calvary he felt the impact of Pentecost amen you know the bride feels the impact of Pentecost too it puts our dancing shoes on because we realize we' passed from Death to life amen nothing can harm us amen because we have eternal life but on the flip side of that amen because remember before Pentecost you know Peter tried to scheme in his mind how can I stay close and how can I do this and you know but then a woman came to him you know when he's warming himself in the fire aren't you one of them and then another one came and then a man came all these things and that pressure broke him where he became a a a god denying cursing preacher curing preacher right swearing and all those things but after Pentecost greater far greater pressure Came Upon the disciples cuz there wasn't some people by a fire outside the Judgment Hall they were in the Judgment Hall standing before the same ones that Jesus did and Peter said well what should we do should we serve God or man oh boy basically we're not backing up we're not quitting you can't make us we're going to keep walking on with God yes and so the devil realized I've got a problem yeah Hallelujah I've got a real problem here hallelujah are you following where I'm you because why he was now walking by Revelation he wasn't walking by humanistic fear and worry and all these things he was walking by Revelation amen so now I just going to read this from the church age book now remember this Christ in the true in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works is which is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible army yes sir what are we we're bone of his bone flesh flesh of his flesh life of his life we're part of the Lord Jesus we are united with him amen what do we stand for this word is true amen God is always right in every situation God is always right no matter what's going on in my life he's right amen I may be I may be the tale I may be going through all kind of trouble but he is right he knows what he's doing I have full confidence in him amen hallelujah someone someone join in for a second amen doesn't matter what's happening in life you say I'm going through a the ringer God knows what he's doing God wants to prove himself he wants to manifest himself he wants you to trust him in the storm now I made completely butcher this dream that you know Christine had the other day but I think it's a real good one you know she was she was here in the harbor and there was a you know the harbor was Cal but out in the cook TR was big massive Seas there was a fairy went out there and that's you know the waves are swamping it and all these things and now she's not a water person me I love the sea many times sailing there as a young boy you know you can't even see the the shore because the swell was so high above the master of your boat I was having a great time the boat would you know pitch pole over and spit you out you had to swim after it try and catch it so it didn't know I was loving it that's me she's the opposite of that kind of deal hey but but the thing is the Lord told her I want you to go out there I want you to get into this little boat and I want you to go out there and she's like well Lord I don't want to go out there but if you want me to go out there I'll go out there and then so she went out there and as she was going into this big storm it was calm all around where she was but the storm was still raging yeah why cuz Jesus was in the boat too so the thing is right God wants you actually to go into a storm sometimes he doesn't want you to stay in a nest he wants you to fly he wants you to be like him he wants you to see what you're made of and you're not going to see that by sitting in a sheltered little bubble where where you have no harm no trouble he wants you to step into it amen so she went into the storm that the is being washed and covered and Things by waves and she's just just in this little calm patch as the storm goes on around her but do you trust them to go into the storm Hallelujah see she said Lord I trust you I'll go out there I don't want to but I'll go out there CU I trust you see and it's if we can trust him in every situation you've got Victory am no matter sickness sorrow pain hard whatever the storm is if you can trust him in that storm you've already won amen hallelujah amen she can do the greater work she'll be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definely thred today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it do you love it when the Lord Reveals His word to your heart I mean not to your top two inches only but but into your heart amen you love that amen with true Revelation Our Lives the gates of hell canot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen so gate stops access we know that so any that tries to stop you to get to the blessings of God you're going to Prevail over there am me you take the battering realm of his word say God you said This Promise is mine I'm coming through the devil I'm coming through amen you may feel discouraged bang through the that door of discouragement you may feel weary trouble that's a door trying to stop you that's a gate trying to stop you amen you say no Satan I'm not I'm not staying on this side I'm going in amen cuz we got to realize we're in line for a breakthrough hallelujah we're in line for a breakthrough we're actually sit up for a breakthrough like blind bmus he was there in Jericho he was lined up for a breakthrough why cuz Jesus came his way he cried out by faith amen and he got healed amen he had a breakthrough in his life Hallelujah you can take zakus any they lined their lives were lined up for a breakthrough amen amen see it is the authority it is the revelation of God that gives us authority over the devil why is that because we think like God thinks God knows he has authority Jesus did not ask one time Mr devil can you please leave this is not convenient right now he said no go Legion leave well can I go to the onean okay I'll give you permission to do that you know so that's how the Lord knows he knows he has Authority but do you know cuz the devil wants you to wants you to think that you have no power with God like brother one time he woke up in the morning the devil was in the corner of his room cackling like a chicken saying you have no power over me you've got no power with God Satan and and brother Bram said just get out in the name of Jesus Christ and the thing left but the enemy is trying to intimidate him you think you've got power you think you're Victorious you think the blood's more than enough no you've got no power with me that's what he does he tell you that you've got to call him at his bluff say Satan you're lying he's not going to tell you you can cast me out now yes I've lost no he fights like he's winning he's he's he fights like he's going to win and some many times we fight like we're going to lose I think we should walk and fight like we've won because that's how because Jesus said it's finished right when he died on Calvary it's finished it's done am that's in his mind is that in your mind is that in your heart that's how heaven knows it that's how Satan knows it but do you know it the same way Jesus amen you see but the thing is if we let's just read a few more I like this we having the same Spirit of faith according as it as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak amen knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction amen I like it how the Apostle Paul would just classify every trial that would ever come across any person any time that's a light Affliction let's just put this in the right category okay but then also which is but for a moment oh that seems like a long moment but you know I remember like waking up Christmas morning it was a long morning but then it was but then it f it felt long but really it was a same length as any other morning but it felt long and many times a trial can feel very long but it's just for a moment moment and it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory thank you Lord so it's not here to break us it's not here to destroy us no it's actually working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory so you got to look at your light Affliction and say you're working on my behalf thank you Lord God has put this in my life for me and you're a light Affliction and you're just for a moment am yes sir you remember seasons of your life you know you have a newborn baby you think man are they and you know they're going to grow up right but they're spewing over the floor they've got colock they're not sleeping there's diapers and all it's a season of life but it's just for a moment Yeah because sometimes you look back after th that th that time's well and truly gone you're thinking you know and then you get some kind of nostalgia feelings and babies and some of us do no not me it was I enjoyed it but I was happy to wave and see it Go by right but you see it but it see it feels when you're out of it just like a moment but when you're in it it feels like a very long time you're sleep deprived and man you and and Christine bore the massive brunt of it so I just got a little sliver I was like man this is too much and she's just powering on but you know it feels like a group a very heavy thing but you know they're going to grow up you know it's just for a moment right and it's actually working in Eternal way it's actually working for you what do you work patience you call on God more amen you can actually enter into their needs more you actually feel sorry you can relate to people who are you know who need help and you can't you know you know it it it changes you so that it's actually for your good it's not just for their good while they're fed and they're change and they're clean and blah blah no no it's more than that it works trials work on many angles it's like a pinball machine that pinball hits a lot of things in the machine as it goes through and like a trial can affect many different people but it's all for everyone's good yeah amen while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen what is that that's God's word right we look to the end right amen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal Hallelujah so you're going through a trial you say Lord reveal to me that this is a light Affliction reveal to me this is just for a moment Lord may I not be consumed in the here and the now and the you know the this is what's going on May I not be fixed cuz the devil wants you to be fixed on that because if you're fixed on that then you'll be humanly trying to sort things out right but if you look at it through God's eyes how God sees it cuz this is how God sees it Paul wasn't just filling in letters while can't think of anything to write to the Corinthians let's make them feel a bit better no he was revealing to us this is what trials are this is what hardships are they're a light Affliction they're doing they're working for your good they're just for a moment okay so if we can look at it that way we won't fear won't grip us so we won't work out things humanly yeah true now this is a very nice scripture but I but I pray this is a revelation to you behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth uh an instrument for his work I have created the wasted to destroy this is the Lord saying I've created the wasted to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper that's right I trust this anchors in here this is how God thinks amen because God knows the end from the beginning he knows the day he created the devil remember you came from the mind of God you came from God you go back to God the devil was created he wasn't an elected Angel right and the angels that fell with him they were just created they have an expiry date remember there'll come a day where the devil will never be am he's gone he's burning and we're dancing Amen on the streets of gold and to me I'm not dancing cuz he's burning I'm dancing cuz I'm on the streets of gold Hallelujah hey he could be who cares what he's doing I I'm an eternity right but you see there'll come a day there's a time in the Book of Revelation where the devil gets off and we continue on so you've got to realize a trial may get on but it's going to get off right you got to realize that you say I'm going through a big problem no it's it got on it got off amen it will get off amen so so no weapon formed against you shall prosper I pray this becomes a revelation it's not just something to put on the fridge your Instagram that sounds good no this weapon that's been formed against me will not Prosper amen it's not going to win it's not going to have Dominion is not going to conquer me no it's going to come to an end amen amen and every tongue that shall rise against me in judgment thou shall condemn Hallelujah who's ever felt a condemning Voice or thought come when you're in a trial oh yeah what is that that's a voice rising in judgment well if you did this this wouldn't happened and this happened because of this and this is you're the problem and no God's using this to mold God's using this to shape amen God's using this to show his glory right but you've got to stand on your feet say Satan I'm a redeemed Blood Washed Holy Ghost filled Son of God daughter of God I've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ I belong to him and he can't lose me amen so that's why you got to raise up say Satan shut up and sit down no this is the hour for the bride to speak it's not the hour for unbelief to speak it's not the hour for problems to speak it's time for people to stand up with the word of God and confess it and say God your word is true amen so no weapon that's formed against the Prosper it may be sickness it may be financial trouble may be trouble in the family may be in your body going through a time of life or menopause or whatever it may be this thing will not Prosper against you why because these things cannot take Revelation from a soul amen the devil can't take Revelation from you that's right he can't touch your soul I mean he can attack your body he he can attack your mind but he can't take that Revelation out of your heart that's why you got to realize that this thing will not Prosper you know sure some people they get sick and die God uses is that sickness to take them to Heaven am oh my Lord right but if they can just be but the thing is the closer people get to death that are Christians the more happy they are because their reasoning begins to leave and the true self comes forth you know like brother Ram said about that Sunday school teacher she backslid went to a denominational Church she's a Sunday school teacher she got some sickness and you know she's dying there in the hospital and her Sunday school class came to you know say goodbye she's on her deathbed you know and and as she was dying her reasoning left her and she realized her true spiritual State and she cried out I'm lost that preacher you know the the minister was there smoking cigarettes saying you lied to me go get that Holy Ghost Holy Roller girl there you know go get that preacher you and she sadly she died in that state but now if you take the flip side of that and you take a real believer who sealed into the kingdom they could come into that hospital with trouble on their mind worry concerned all these things but then when they're when they're about to cross over all that reasoning will leave them and their true self will come to the Forefront instead of crying out I'm lost I'll say I'm saved Hallelujah Jesus in the room to take me away hallelujah hallelujah he's here to carry me home amen and be and all that all that reasoning and trouble would leave them like that why cuz the true self comes forth what if we just s thought like that all the time cuz that's how the Lord Jesus Jesus thinks of you and I when you were when he was on the cross you were on his mind the joy set before him going up gogoa that day was you redeemed around the throne amen so when he died he thought of you amen he knew he did that on your behalf amen amen praise God so what if we thought like that all the time prise the Lord we you know don't let our reasoning and trouble tear us down say no I know in whom I have believed amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now the thing is man operates by fear because they don't know like heaven knows right and hell don't tell the truth anyway so they don't know like hell knows either right but fear comes in when man tries to reason things out and tries to work things out man will do crazy things when they're afraid fear is such a killer popularity comes because of fear people want to be popular they're afraid of what people think of them and it's such a it's such a snare now Saul King Saul Now not not Saul who became Paul he operated the kingdom by fear think about it he was anointed by the prophet of God the spirit of God changed him but yet he operated the kingdom by fear there was a time when he was calling wanted to call Israel to to a battle and he cut up an oxen sent the four parts to the different parts of the nation and said if you don't come you're going to be like this dead animal so it was fear that was motivating cuz he wasn't thinking like heaven was thinking he wasn't thinking like the word was thinking he wasn't thinking how the word would say if you follow me with all your heart and love me then then you will be the head and not the tail one will chase a th000 two will chase 10,000 amen this is your inheritance this is your promise he wasn't thinking like that he didn't know like heaven knew amen he was because of fear he was trying to you know run run the kingdom the wrong way but yet he would wrap it with a religious rapping you see he would he would he was instructed by Samuel wait for a certain day and I'll come and sacrifice then you can go fight the battle and on the evening time of that seventh day Saul because of fear sacrificed himself so his re because he wasn't thinking because Samuel knew when he was going to come and Samuel we know is the word of God to Israel that time because he's a prophet right so if he just if if Saul just believed the same way Heaven believed I'm I'm I'm just using the title all the time because I want that to stick right if he if Saul just believed like heaven believed he would have waited for Samuel he wouldn't have been worrying he wouldn't have been freeding he wouldn't have been troubled by some of the men leaving the Army he said no this is what God has said I'm staying with the word I'm not and then but the thing is he didn't do that cuz he didn't have that Revelation see he's just going by human understanding so fear came in and he gave you you he made the sacrifice and then when the sacrifice it ended then Samuel turned up but you see King Saul here said because I feared the people and obeyed their voice this is verse 24 so so he so he gave the sacrifice because he fear motivated him now how many people rule their family have a Christian walk out of fear they do things because they're afraid they're afraid of hell they're afraid of the wrath of God they're afraid of the tribulation they're afraid of this they're afraid that you know their you know their children will actually have their own thoughts and they have their own humanity and their wife will actually have her own personality and there may be some laughter in the home and you know there may be some Joy you know they want to be all restricted down like a like put a duvet in one of those vacuum bags and suck it all right down that's what fear does will suck everything right down and people will oh but I'm in the message no but they're being they're operating out of fear because they're not walking with Revelation they're walking out of fear how many people you know how many people sadly we see that happens they're Christians out of fear not out of faith not by Revelation amen so so Samuel I mean sorry Saul LED his whole LED his whole Kingdom out of fear he worked out now what do I have to do this he said well I'm fulfilling the word you didn't come all these things no it was fear that motivated him but we're going to realize that fear doesn't belong to us you see fear will cause us to Pander to evil spirits fear will cause us to try and appease and just have no trouble and keep everything fine I don't want to upset that person no it's really a spirit many times if you stand for the word God will stand for you amen amen if you stand for the word God will stand for you say well I don't want trouble in my home well I'm sorry wherever Jesus goes there's trouble there was trouble in Jericho there was trouble in Nazareth there was trouble in the synagogue where he was raised up he said this day the scriptures fulfilled there wasn't a great pandemonium rejoicing worship go on no they got angry they wanted to Stone him they wanted to throw him down a cliff our lord Jesus you know you think about this guy you know he caused he caused trouble in the temple he caused trouble wherever he went he crossed the sea to deliver Legion caused trouble with the farmers so so the rural people didn't like him the city Folk didn't it was trouble everywhere amen and then you see the disciples what that same Jesus comes into them what do they get trouble through Great Tribulation do we enter into the kingdom of God yes amen right praise God Amen well I'm entering the kingdom of God so you you've got to expect trouble but you don't have to put up with the trouble you don't have it's not okay I'll yeah I'll punch you you punch me who's yeah I know I've seen it before but who's seen those videos where two guys are standing there facing off and they slap each other who's ever seen that it's a game I'll slap you first and you slap me it is insanity but yet but yet Christians will operate the same way they think well I've had a Victorious time so basically I slap the devil in other words now I've just going to wait for him to take his shot and they stand there and just take it that's Insanity no we're going to plead the blood I mean we have the best defense we don't have to put up with this nonsense we have to put up with him trying to rearrange Our Lives no plead the blood for your family for yourself trouble comes in plead the blood pray create a different kind of you know create a different kind of an atmosphere there's a real heaviness in the house put on some rejoicing music you know change the atmosphere a little bit you know you don't have to feel down and out no you should feel up and in amen why hallelujah hallelujah why cuz we're in Christ and we're going up amen so we don't have to put up with a bad atmosphere the devil don't want you happy that's right I don't know if You' realized it he's not he's not The Happy Guy no he is Mr buzzkill he wants to ruin he wants to take the edge off everything he does he wants to ruin he wants to rain on your parade and keep raining and he wants to tell you the reason it's raining is because of you why do we put up with it come on why do we we've got to realize we have authority over the devil if you woke up on the wrong side of the beard some people say well I woke up on the wrong I'm grumpy today it's Grump well it's grumpy Monday or or hump day or whatever even Friday Friday can be a grumpy day I don't know how but but it's but it's a decision I'm making you laugh cuz I'm yeah we're going somewhere with this okay you see but people decide I'm grumpy today that's it yeah right do you have to stay that way no why why let the devil dictate you you have to be sad you have to be down this is your portion no my portion is Joy my portion is being drunk on the Holy Ghost my my portion is eternal life amen my portion is him you know is the Lord Jesus so you know but you see the thing is if we if the devil he tries to stop us believing like heaven believes amen it's like when you know you know the disciples would come back and they were rejoicing because they had authority over the devil and Jesus said no don't Rejoice over that Rejoice cuz your names are written in heaven amen so even greater than having authority over the devil you've got to realize your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life amen if you could you could you imagine that could you imagine that and in a way we have looked at the Lamb's Book of Life but could you imagine that you you're transported up into heaven the record is open what's your name Benjamin John Glo oh yes you're on page 35 here you are wouldn't that be a jubilee wouldn't that be a jubilee wouldn't that be the most glorious thing Hallelujah when you saw that and then and then you read and and you see where why is only my name on the book oh because the lamb washed it that's just my name pardoned hallelujah it's all gone amen wouldn't that be a glorious thing but don't you realize you've actually been allowed to look into the Lamb's Book of Life amen because when the message when the word came your way Hallelujah it called you by name amen it may not have orderly said your name but it called you by name amen and what happened you responded to him you surrendered your life he filled you with the Holy Ghost and God's telling you your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah amen that's how Heaven Heaven's records that's how Heaven's records think of you I think we should think about ourselves the same kind of way Hallelujah to the lamb glory to God glory to God Amen I think this is how we should look at ourselves amen we shouldn't operate by fear we should operate by Revelation you see when Saul was Saul was confronted with Goliath that fear he was walking with amen stopped them right there because fear could fear only motivates to a certain point you look at North Korea I wouldn't be surprised to that if that place ate itself up it's going to all dictatorships like that have to crumble cuz it's a kingdom of fear it's a kingdom of intimidation and that's how the devil wants to come in in our ranks is to have a kingdom of fear but no perfect love casts out all fear and we're living in a season of perfect love we should have have no fear the devil wants to put fear on you right yeah yeah I know I've shared the testimony probably many times but you know when when we were living there in frickleton Grove Christine and I and there was that there was that demon in the house we were renting and that Spirit was there felt trouble and fighting and oppression all these things being in the house and we're praying against it realizing this is not us you got to realize if the enemy comes against you it's not you it's the enemy it's not God it's not you it's the enemy it's either one of the three okay now now and we were praying against this thing for it to leave and I felt this fear come upon me when we were praying and after we finished praying Christian said how do you know I felt fear well I was feeling it now I had I had two choices in that moment I could either succumb to the fear or this is terrible there's a there's a supernatural being in the house and you know oh no maybe the blood's not strong enough maybe I'm not right with God I could have those kind of feelings those kind of thoughts all right or I could have like I said I said Satan you have no right to put your fear upon me I rebuke in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen was the fear feeling real yes amen was it a real emotion yes did I feel it yes but what do you do with it you either accept it and let it rule you or you rebuke it because you realize God has given you authority over the enemy and in the name of Jesus Christ commanded to leave that Spirit left shortly after that there was such peace in that home so just because because many people look at me say oh I feel fearful sometimes therefore I must not have perfect love no that feeling tries to to come upon you to intimidate you to try and get you to second guess your salvation are you with me today so don't let fear intimidate you well what if I what if I what if I no what has Jesus done what has he already done for you amen sir see if we just thought like he did I think we could just go rejoicing amen hallelujah amen you say well I've got a lot of trouble I've got a lot of things how do I how do I break out of this how do I think like heaven thinks you got to focus on the Promises remember you've only got so much bandwidth I think I've just got dial up you know but I've got some okay I've got some praise the Lord I've got some so it's very limited what go what can happen okay it depends what I focus on is what's going to fill here right it's like a news feed or whatever you're looking at on your phone you know your screen is only can only be filled with certain thing right so now I could either focus on my problems and my situation and the what could bees which are always negative see the devil never says imagine God coming down to your house imagine the angel because the angel Lord visits homes you know imagine the Lord just stepping in that's right Hallelujah imagine the presence just changing in the room and you don't need to tell your children or your wife or your or your husband he's here they all know he's here and you just have a glorious Jubilee for however long just just worshiping and rejoicing you can have that kind of a visitation do you believe that we don't need to wait for camp or church to have a glorious visitation with God he can step in you can be driving along and you can be having a jubilee in a traffic jam and you can be glad for the traffic jam because that means you're longer in the car with him Hallelujah this ain't Pie in the Sky these things happen glory to God you can be at work man there was um it was after Jimmy preached the Thursday man I was just I was just doing my job you know I was having such a good time I felt such a sweet humble presence around me Hallelujah it was such a glorious Thursday thank you brother Jimmy for that service but what was that brother R says when the angel of the Lord come around you you feel the sweet humble presence that was a good day Hallelujah we can have that more but what's going on in your fiber copper fiber optic connection you got to focus in on the promise amen now we know that technology uh represents something in the spiritual now this is a nuclear fusion reactor they're trying to build everyone around the world's trying to build these things so what they're trying to do basically is replicate the sun on the earth so the power in the sun they want to replicate it on the earth so the Sun what it does is it fuses hydrogen different atoms together and it releases releases energy and that's why you can that's why we get warm that's why we have sunlight because of a fusion reaction two atoms being fused together so they're trying to replicate this in a basically a big giant donut thing with a strong gravitational field mag magnetic field and superheat at different things now the longest they can cause this to happen is for about 48 seconds is the longest they can get it and they've actually got it now that the energy they get out is greater than the energy they put in now one of the ignition sources for this is when they get a they get multiple laser beams and they focus it on two two atoms of uh heavy hydrogen so all these laser beams fire down on these hydrogen atoms and it causes this thing to ignite and then all this energy is released now I was thinking about this remember because the natural types are spiritual so they're trying to replicate the power of the sun which is is unlimited upon the earth now they've got to realize that God has already made this and I'm not talking about the s n no he has replicated the s o n upon the Earth Amen in a body of people amen that it's unlimited you got to realize if you have the Holy Ghost this morning you have unlimited power there is unlimited potential amen there is there's there's no limit to what God could lead you to pray for there's no limit to what God could cause you to do you amen that that power has already been replicated upon the Earth amen but so but what they do is they get all these lasers to focus in on one promise or two Adams right and what happened in the upper room 120 in the upper room they got God got 120 Believers focused on one promise I mean and that promise was I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I will fulfill the promise of Joel so all them got all their Humanity out of the way their carnality their fear their whatever's happened in the last week and they focused in on the promise saying This Promise is true this is the season God's going to manifest it it's going to happen and what to do God got them in I to fulfill the word amen now friends how much more now you and I if we could focus in on the Promises of God as an individual as a family as a church we get not focus on problems not focus on fussing not focus on fear but focus on faith amen what if we focused what could happen there could be a spontaneous amen ignition of unlimited power amen with the Holy Ghost pour himself out change lives bring protocols home bring healing bring restoration bring salvation amen God it's unlimited with what God could do who's with me tonight now this morning now this ain't sometime in the future I'll say they're trying to get this up and running but this has been up and running for 2,000 years Hallelujah I mean since the day of Pentecost we've had nuclear fusion reactors walking around in bodies of Flesh amen what the power of the S so n living Hallelujah hope you don't mind the science lesson but you see now it's unlimited but that's how heaven knows you yes Jesus knew who he was he wasn't guessing am I the Messiah I don't feel like the Messiah today well I feel like I'm today you know no no he knew who he was he knew what God had made him to be and that gave him perfect Faith do you have a revelation in your heart that you are the bride of Christ amen do you have that Revelation that you're part of this word that you're here that God wants to use you to fulfill his word he wants to fulfill prophecy in your life amen do you have that Revelation in here amen well that that should give you perfect Faith well then people say well if I have perfect faith I could speak whatever I want and get it that's not perfect Faith perfect faith is being surrendered to God and then when God wants to speak and do what he wants to do he does it amen remember remember the Holy Ghost we don't use the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost uses us amen we are not here to twist God to our will no we are here that God would mold us and change us to his will and remember Jesus was the first nuclear fusion reactor Hallelujah he was all the power would ever be in all the rectors around the world in one man the fullness of godhe bodily right amen and he said I've not come to do do my own will but the father's will Hallelujah but that gave him perfect Faith now what about you and I friends because we got to realize we have received a word that gives us perfect Faith this message produces per perfect Faith amen and that's why all hell is against this Revelation because the devil realizes because he's seen it before if God ever gets into people again if this word ever puts on flesh again I've got big trouble yeah my my kingdom is going to be laid waste amen what I really know in my heart I'm going to see you know who's people people you know well let's just take the positive side who's ever been longing for a day or for a moment and then you're finally in it you imagine what it's going to be like how maybe maybe all of us who got married you know you know it's going to happen even before you get engaged you know what's going to happen and then you get engaged and the countdown's Really on then you set a date oh my it's pinned the invitations are out and it's countdown time and then slowly then the dress comes then the recept you know all the all the details you need for a wedding where the ceremon is going to be who's going to be the celebrant the guest the uh you know the best man the you you all those things the Bridesmaids all those things they come into manifestation Hallelujah so what was just a will you marry me I love you will you marry me and a yes becomes manifested and then so the excitement begins to build because what was just a a wonderful idea that you believed was going to happen your faith now become sa and then there's the morning man I nearly put food on my suit anyway I didn't that was fine but you know but but there's the morning and and you've had the rehearsal you've had all these things now finally here's the day and then you're standing in the moment oh hallelujah praise God who remembers that moment if you haven't had that moment yet I pray you have that moment it's incredible time and then the rest of your life is awesome too but you know what I mean but but so you're longing for that time and then it happens amen now you take the flip side of that and all of your just like the devil his because his kingdom is ruled by fear it's not ruled by Revelation it's ruled by fear so all of his greatest fears are becoming it's not just he's kicked out of heaven but it becomes more material all the time where God said to the said to him in the garden the seed of the woman's going to bruise the head of the seed of The Serpent and then deliverer started to come Moses came Abraham came no was here these are not an order as you know but you know God would manifest himself down all the way through what's happening that promise is becoming more materialized so his fear and anxiety just begins to go higher and higher and higher and higher because the sum of all fears of him are becoming manifested right and then finally the Lord Jesus is born and he says if thou be the Son of God he tries to kill him as a 2-year-old doesn't work he tries to do all kind of things doesn't work he cannot stop this man I mean he can't make a temporise like he did in did in did in Moses he can't make you know anything happen like that caus Joseph to lie cuz all the Believers down Through the Ages have had something against them but this man's different cuz he's the God man so he couldn't cause he couldn't cause this man to fall like he did the others and then now he's hanging on Calvary and then then he gives his last breath he goes down into hell takes the keys of Hell death and the grave off him and then now the devil his fear is now now Adam's restored What About Eve so he tries to get into the church he tries to make it lukewarm for and Powerless but then now we're coming to the end time where God sends Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the fathers and then now what what what the devil saw at Pentecost is what the devil sees now amen hallelujah so now the devil begins to see the bride of Christ rising up realizing who she is amen realizing who she is as God knows her Hallelujah so what's happening the sum of all of his fears are becoming manifested yes amen amen and that's why he tries to put you under the same blanket to try and keep you down but if we just approach everything by divine revelation right and let Faith motivate our lives that will never bother us irrespective of what happens in life you know the devil says look this is going to happen you can say step one stop talking step two how do you know you don't know right no my father said this in his word my father has revealed this this to me not just in here but in here when's it going to happen that's up for God to do amenu praise the Lord let's just let's just finish with this quote but the church has received a Heavenly sign and Astronaut amen Jesus Christ in the form of a pillar of fire that he was in the Old Testament that he was when he met Saul on the road down there to Damascus the same Jesus here today and what does it do does it bring fear it brings love a uniting of one another amen a feeling for one another it brings the love of God a uniting uniting us and brings us the body of Christ into a Unity as a bride now that's what it's doing now this great Union amen amen do you I pray we know who we are no matter what's going on in life that don't change you that's right got to realize in the Garden of Eden God gave Adam and Eve dominion over Nature by creation by birth you put it that way Satan came along to Eve and said you'll be as Gods but by education and that word Gods there is Elohim you'll be like Elohim they already were like him because they had dominion over the Earth they were Gods over the Earth right so God made them Gods by birth Satan said no that was wrong Eve you need education to become what you already are God has given us the Dominion by a birth he's he G he he's given us all authority over the Enemy by birth it's not by education the Devil comes along and says well do you know enough have you prayed enough have you studied enough do you listen enough all those things are good we should be feeding on the word fill up on good things don't be the world's trash can okay fill up on good things but you got to realize your birth gives you Authority your birth gives you Authority it's not what you know how you know whatever no your birth gives you Authority amen your birth actually causes you to realize my father is God Amen then what can you do then you begin to know as Heaven believes about you you believe the same thing that no matter what happens in life like you imagine the Apostle Paul he's there in the dungeon he knows his head's going to be cut off now fear would want to grip him saying this is the end but thing is he had seen too much of the Lord he saw him on the road to Damascus it changed his life what he received a birth he saw the Lord Jes Jesus all the way through his life he knew he never failed and in that critical moment he he be to write to Timothy there's a Crown of Life awaiting me and all those that love him Hallelujah so that fear because you think you the devil wants to give that final kick I've got you now Paul and the thing that the devil tried to use was the death of this physical body but because Paul did not look at this world by natural eyes and natural understanding and by fear and reasoning he looked at it by faith he realized this is is not my end yeah this is allowing me to go where I really want to be Hallelujah so it doesn't matter what happens in life you say well everything's going wrong no but are you a child of God Amen just focus on that and rejoice Lord you've made me you've made me like you I am part of you Lord hallelujah so let's just finish there I just want to finish with that question Heaven Knows hell knows but do you about what God has made you already amen let's have the musicians this morning [Applause] amen I pray we all know who we are you say well I failed so many times that's why he died that's why the Lord Jesus died on Calvary he say there's a lot of moments in my Christian walk that I wish never happened that's why he died amen his grace is sufficient he's our he's our intermediary he's our intercessor he's our high priest is he not amen he we we need to look at our Christian walk through God's eyes remember Abraham had a lot of you read Abraham's Journey with God it wasn't just Sarah that laughed in the presence of God when God said I'm going to give you the promised son Abraham already did it here comes God down this great supernatural being comes down picture it and God says you're going to be the father of Nations your name is Abraham Abraham gets down in the dust and laughs at God At This Promise that's that's quite a thing where God has done all these things for him yeah then finally says I'm going to do this for you and he laughs but then now when God see see the devil want to take that and say look at what he did here how can he be the father of Faith but when God writes his commentary of his life after the blood of Jesus Christ he said he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in the faith giving praise to God I think it's Romans chapter 4 so that's how God viewed Abraham we normally view ourselves as as the Genesis account of Abraham right this wrong I did this I did this but God looks at us in a totally different way I pray we can look at ourselves in that way too does it make you arrogant does it make you proud does it make you loose and LAX no it makes you more humble and thankful and you want to and and you love him more amen let's um let's stand amen I mean let's sing that song no matter what I see no matter what I hear no matter what I told I believe amen I'll lay a Hallelujah on the altar it looks like it's broken amen no matter what I see no matter what I hear no matter how
