praise the lord praise the lord amen i hope you're warmed up it's nice and cool outside it's getting it's getting heated in here i think just before we go on i heard there's a few testimonies around here and i think because we had this beautiful youth service youth with with our borders there might be more so i'm going to hand the mic over to our precious brother phil i might i think i know i i can guarantee there might be more so you can have your seats and we can we can hear how how good the lord is you wish you saints um the otaki outreach just a quick report on that this is the second saturday that we've had it the first saturday i'd just like to thank brother and paul brother ben that's young ben and marion and brother john for attending because at that time we had a gentleman by the name of tainui and tainu is named after one of the walkers that come to new zealand and he's a local and he carries around a big kunchow which sounds like the shofar so here we are talking about the chauffeur and the trumpets playing and this gentleman has left his family here in otakis born otaki but he likes to walk down the street and blow the chauffeur and if anyone's got any problems which they ask him he goes around and prays for them and then he'll blow the chauffeur and that's like blowing the devil out of their problem areas so i was really blessed he was really blessed having the young brothers there for them for young brother and you know it's always good to have prayer warriors there and he actually sat beside brother impal so when we prayed mate he got earful and he was blessed with that air force amen and he was blessed with the young brothers because the other the young brothers could actually follow the word and pray as well and so he got really blessed with that so that was the first saturday the second saturday brother anias brother cuban brother cuban's mother-in-law sister vanessa's mum myself and belinda were there and the next gentleman came in was a another maori guy and this guy was the neck level up and he was out of the president of the mongol mob from gisborne and in his past he was like a real mongol and now the lord touched him 18 years ago and brought him to otaki and he did some silly things and bad things in otaki but then the lord touched him when he was in the shower and i want to emphasize this because this is how he come to preaching the word and how the lord touches heart he actually had his wife was sick and he asked she asked for a pastor to come and pray for her so he rang this pastor up and the past said yes i'll be there and the pastor forgot so on the sunday he went there early to the pastor's place to the church and he asked he dressed in his number ones he's like number ones out of his gang suits and he asked the gentleman they're playing in the band where's the past and they sit in the office so he went into the office and said are you the pastor and he said yes so he grabbed the passport the scruff of the neck smashed him in the face dragged him out put him down on the pulpit and smashed him and says where's your jesus now in a church then he went home and he was in the shower and jesus hit him and he was laid out for nine hours on the ground a sobering mess because the lord was dealing with him the next day he got up and he went back to the church and you sat there and you went up to shake the hands of the pastor you saw him coming of course and as he shook the pastor's hand the lord hit him again and he fell down on his knees so that reminds of the gentleman that came with their bully attitude to brother branham and fell at his knees that gentleman his name's kingi and he followed that pastor for the next nine years gave his heart put everything away he couldn't read couldn't write and so he knows now how to read and write but under a denominational spirit right so these are the battlefields that we have faced when we're going out to outreaches as brother and paul known brother and you would know so when you're going out you got to make sure that you know who your god is absolutely you got to have the absolute so when we when he came to the meeting he started testing me and testing me and trying to find out who i was and all this and i told him my testimony and he looked at brother anyas playing the guitar with brother cuban singing songs and he said that man is a preacher you you call me a puppy that's good he said you're just a youth preacher so he says and we don't need you here in otaki to tell us older men than you what to do because we are here and i believe he's older than you i'm a little bit younger than him and so you're just a puppy he says oh okay that's nice i can wake my tail afterwards we sat down and then the kaupapa we have there is that i'll open up with a prayer then we'll ask for a prayer request of whoever's there and then we'll hit those prayers you know if you're ibm missiles you hit those prayers together so if it was a prayer from brother brother um marion will find out his prayers a prayer from brother andy a prayer from brother as we pray for these things together so we're hitting those prayers so if you've got five or six of us hitting those prayers at one that's quite a lot of dynamite throwing at satan he doesn't like it right and it's very effective and then after that we go into having a little bit of a sing-song as well so as we sat down but onto the table with anya said here but the cuban said here i said here the mother-in-law sat here belinda sat here and he sat there he was looking at me all the way because to him it was disrespectful that i'm i went away from him this is the maori culture traditions i should have sat beside him and given that sort of acoloid of mana but i didn't come over here so he looked at me and then i opened up a prayer room from genesis to revelation 23 and we hit that book in the middle and we showed him who he was and we break the bread we break the waters we restored the buildings of the walls in troubles times then he caught it while i was praying all i could hear was and i knew that he was looking you could feel those eyes and then when everyone else started praying he got the shock of his life because he was sitting now beside brother cuban brother cuban is not quite okay when he prays brother anya said to get up and walk away because he couldn't hear himself praying i was over here i knew where i knew the power was coming from this gentleman here just you could hear him as the prayers are going on half an hour and now you could hear him going sweeter and sweeter from um to amen to praise the lord and his voice started getting higher and then you started entering into the prayers and you could feel that he was checking everybody out and here's my wife hands up giving the blast of a trumpet and same to the other sister and afterwards he grabbed the guitar and he sang a wayata a song and it was a really nice mellow song if you didn't know this gentleman you'll think that it was probably a 20 year old singing the song yeah and he was just praising jesus and then he gave his testimony all the scars in his life and all that and when we first met him we go to shake hands it was a it was a mongol mob shake hand right he fisted first when we left he got up shook cuban's hand put his hand like that a typical cuban gave him a crush by the time he went through bolognas and myself you're shaking our hands and he was calling his brother the move of the holy spirit moved then he invited us men onions to come next week to five gentlemen that he knows that they want to start a prayer group up it's too late we got him first but he wants us to come to show them how to pray the last testimony here today i've been going to physio in the vin and i have a taxi driver that acc has supplied he didn't say much in the beginning but today he started telling me about his testimony about how he met the lord because i was talking about the supper room i was talking about the barbecue that we're going to have out there to intercede and to connect with everybody that's walking the streets and then he told me his testimony how he met the lord this guy's a pretty big kiwi guy from gisborne and he's a diver so that's how he got talking and then he was telling me that that's how he met the lord he was out diving one day off the coast of takaha the east coast and he got pulled out on the drift about 13 kilometers the hills got less and less and less and less he knew he was in trouble he had his bottles on dropped his wipe out but he couldn't kick all the time then he saw something moving and i was like it was a shark this side it was a white pointer he knew what it was it circled back around like this and then it came at him and all of a sudden it just flipped over and dived in the water so he saw the body and when a shark goes underwater the next thing you see is going to come up from the bottom to grab you and take you out so here's waiting for that so he started praying and he says maybe the ocean got a bit more water in that day he started praying next to me he felt this bump bump bump bump and what it was was a pod of dolphins and they picked them up and bumped them all the way 13 kilometers back to land that man had an experience of god so today i was able to tell him the experiences that we have had over these last two sundays amen so if you want to come on on saturday at five o'clock to eight o'clock it's been really wonderful just let just let us know it's good to have a company of saints prayers alike even a sister come along and bless you all thank you for your prayers amen thank you brother full that's awesome anyone else i thought so brother armand yes evening saints thank you brother phil for that sharing the testimony um i think every believer's heart is that those last ones would come in no matter how we do it no matter what we need to do it's it is so the last one's coming we didn't come to play around we came here to go home you know so so we have a work to do and and the harvest is plenty and the laborers are few god still sends out his laborers to go find them so yeah i pray that we all do support brother phil i think it's good work he does there and um yeah i'll leave my garden work brother full i come and join you on saturday hey hey lord willing because um it's a bit of my testimony so we um well i said it where's my wife he's usually yes he's my my memory god so that's all right so the sunday um after church we had the youth service on the sunday night six o'clock but in the morning early i started getting a migraine but a terrible headache just didn't leave me so then we had the the two o'clock session with the youth and they're singing their song and those things and i and i left because i just yeah and i had such a headache but you push on because you think oh it's going to break it's going to break it's going to break you know in jesus name i claim my healing or we just walk but it's just balding and balding and building and building and and it's man it's just not nice so i went home early i said to brother ben and brother matt and our brother ed and met i said can you take the service i'm just going to go home i'm just going to go crash and the next day we were going to go hunting so i thought hey if i get a couple of a bit of sleeping then at least we can go the next day because you still want to you know i don't want to disappoint reuben and i wanted to go and hunt with him so next morning i wake up to go to to bed about 10 10 o'clock 11 o'clock because we just had to get so many things done for the hunt and woke up the next morning three o'clock we're on the road we're going hunting but the headache's still there not as much but it's you know you know that feeling it's just saying hello i'm here so i just say no i don't claim it i just keep going so we start hunting and we walk in this in this beautiful place that goddess has provided us out in nature the best place it is there is no demons out there they can they can interfere that god the spirits can't work through anything there it is absolutely wonderful to be out there and i enjoyed the experience and had a wonderful time with the boys and with brother ed and them but the headaches started coming back they started coming back stronger and stronger so evening we were up on a ledge and we we basically was on a clearing looking out towards some other clearings looking for deer and they just kept going and growing and growing and and i just got quiet and if i get quiet you know there's something wrong and i was starting and i was really brave because i said okay i'll climb behind the steering wheel i'll drive home you know i'm fine you know i'll just drive home because you kind of push everything just aside you will just get home but as we left brother ed he suggested that he would drive home and he had to sleep the afternoon you know so i said you know what you drive home i'll just i'll take a shotgun and i'll just lie here couldn't sleep here they grew hit it grew windy road it just grew it just grew it just grew and i got real sick i was not feeling really good and we got to the akita ketarawas and we dropped brother mary on all for this house and we continued on and about five turns later i said to it just stop and i and i threw up and the heat was because now it's so so much that your body just reacts and i and i threw up two three turns later threw up again but man shaking really not feeling good and i was standing there almost starting to feel sorry for myself and uh now you're talking with the lord because remember he puts these things on you because he wants you to know that he's your healer he doesn't put a headache on you to to make you suffer he puts a headache on you because he wants to show you and he doesn't do it we do it because we don't have a discipline we don't take care of our bodies and these things happen but when you pray this power and prayer so i went back into the car and i went and sat down and and and i was just you know very tired and just not feeling too well and i said to brother edward said brother can you guys just lay hands on me and pray for me because i'm feeling really bad and he said let's do it. and and him and the boys and they hear they're all witnesses they laid hands upon me they prayed for me it wasn't supernatural they didn't win wow everything went away all of a sudden but i could the pressure was gone but still had the headache but that that intense pressure went and just left it was a migraine got home and told my wife as always any good husband throw all the bags down and just hit for the show and hit for the bed and i slept so the next morning brother ed said okay well tomorrow i'm going to work from home and i said well i think i'm going to call in sick because if i feel anything like this i'm just not going to go to work at all and i went to sleep and me and my wife we prayed together and i slept and i fell asleep with this headache and i woke up the next morning perfectly fine like sober before my alarm perfectly fine and we went to bed what time brother that was about it all 10 11 o'clock again again late and the next morning i went to work and brother ed stayed at home but the lord gave me my healing and i could go to work and when i was at work i could actually testify of what just happened because we had a guy that was at work and he said and it's a long story but i won't go into it but he said about and this is the battles we face he said about most war starts either religion money greed and i said to him my bible never tells me to fight a war except it's against satan so if you can show me a scripture where it says i can go and kill on those things i think you must read the bible because the bible is there to lead to learn to love your neighbor as you love yourself and to love god so then that opened it up and then i gave him a bit of the testimony how god healed me and all those things had to happen so that i could have a five minute to a ten minute talk with this guy and show him the grace of god so sometimes we go through that so the next day you prepared for what he's going to send you so i just want to say thank you for the lord for healing me and it might not be instant but he is a healer amen [Applause] thank you brother armand anyone else youth without borders friday night saturday sunday do you have one okay let's stand and worship then shall we um the lord's real and he deals for with anyone he wishes he is sovereign he's got everything in control i sought the truth and men gave their answer but something just wasn't right i couldn't explain them they sounded like strangers it just didn't meet my thirst inside then i'd heard indeed go cry heard a voice speak to my heart it said child you don't belong down here come up from where you are then on an eagles cry you told me i could fly and i believed the world that i had heard and sold up to the sky when an eagle cries [Music] how i was thrusting and i was calling from somewhere deep inside the deep unveiled through through your seventh angel the voice of the bridegroom calling to his bride then an eagle's cry i heard a voice speak to my heart it said child you don't belong down there come up from where you are then i heard and eagles cry [Music] indeed go cry [Music] now i am flying above all the confusion below everything's clearer now i'm flying above the storm in every situation whatever comes my way i

be changed forever o god please may your grandmother lord and comfort the family too we pray lord commit ourselves into your hands we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats tonight so i want to speak about faith in action and i was thinking about this last week and i trust everyone tuned into the youth without borders and they were very blessed and you know brother brahm says i just want to lay some uh comments out but you know he says he says the only the only thing to bring that right atmosphere he's speaking about dancing and music and so on then for the dancers to put on your old music that makes dances and everybody gets thinking what a good time they're going to have dancing and so forth and they'll end up having a big whooping time put the right kind of music on the piano the organ and everybody in the atmosphere that jesus christ is there and going to meet everything that they have need of something is going to take place so it goes from people getting the atmosphere of a party or a music or a concert he brings it right into the churches and if you get into the right atmosphere you'll get the right kind of a right kind of results he says atmosphere he says but that's the hardest thing there is to do and that is to get the people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing so who wants to be in the atmosphere of believing tonight you know we're not here just you know i was thinking that you know church is not a passive thing you know it's not like you you know it's just you pause the preacher walk and get a snack come back and you know you know just watch and just kind of you know it's it's not a passive thing but it's actually the faith of the people pulls certain things you know you see in the life of jesus where where he'd be walking by and you know one for example is a seraphinician woman and you know she had a daughter that was vex grievously vexed with the devil but but she managed to her her faith went into action and it went beyond discouragement it's amazing how much jesus tried to push her off the promise but he already knew what was in her but you see if you have real faith if it's been revealed to you you'll go past all discouragement past you i can't think of a better word or a better phrase but it's like jesus just tried to better you know i'm not even sent to you he says you know it's not even me to to to to feed the dogs the crumbs and you know he tried to basically just you know call her a dog and different things but her faith went beyond that and and and she worshipped him and and he said basically grace your faith you'll find who healed them well so it wasn't just a passive thing but it was actually a reaching out of faith amen brought the promise into her family it's the same thing with you and i you know we're all on the same team hey we're all on the same team right we're not we're not this you know it's not red against blue or whatever color whatever color you know this is not a parliament you know there's a government and there's the opposition then there's the whoever's and the you know the bank bet you know back benches no no we're all on the same team we don't have our own agenda we've got god's agenda the agenda of his word that's the thing we're interested in you know we're not interested in what what we can necessarily push our thing it's not about us pushing our own borough but we want god's kingdom to be established in the hearts and lives of people i mean so you know we're all in this together so you know i was really blessed by the services of brother john you know he would he would mention the um scripture quite a lot about jesus after the resurrection he'd speak to peter and you know he asked the question peter do you love me and then you know you know the fur he says yes i love you he says feed my lambs they asked them again do you love me feed my sheep so so the effect basically jesus is telling peter if you really love me you're going to feed some people you're going to nurture people you're going to feed them food that they can grow on that and and that's the proof that you love me it's not that you just stand there and say oh jesus you're so wonderful and look up in the sky and try and have a religious kind of moment no no yeah there should be a giving there'd be a life there's a faith goes into action and it actually supports one another hallelujah so that's the that's the kind of faith i'm kind of talking about i probably may i feel like i scramble it's like scrambled eggs but you know i'm sure the omelet will get made and it'll make sense but you know we're all on the same team and he asked the question do you love me says feed my sheep and feed my lambs now you may say well i'm not a minister i don't preach but that's not necessarily the food we always give we know sheep live on cheap food and brother baby says that's the word of god it's not creed it's not dogmas it's not opinions it's the word of god that's what sheep live on but you know the bible tells us in ephesians that every if we can go to ephesians chapter four i'm let's just read a bit of this because you know i just think we can i believe by the help of the lord we can just go a step higher tonight you know we can go beyond just having church and i don't believe we just have church we have church you know i believe we really have church you know god really opens his word and he anoints it with spirit and you know you know his holy ghost is not just intellectual trying to grasp something but god really does something in this place but i believe we can go further than what we have you know it's amazing the effort it's amazing that the effort people put in to go watch a big sporting event or a great big concert it's amazing the effort i'm not even talking about the athletes or the musicians or i'm talking about the people just go and watch they put a lot of effort in they're up at all kind of crazy hours you know if you know if the rugby's on at 2am they're up at 2am and they're and they'll leave it at 2am they're up at 1 30 to get all the pre-match and get all excited and you know buy spend way too much on a jersey that's you know defunct after the tournament and you know but but they put a lot of effort in because they're under expectation and they want everyone to know whose team they're on you know i heard a joke or not really a joke but there was a i don't know how he communicated but there was a blind uh blind deaf man and he went to church every sunday so he couldn't see anything couldn't hear anything and but but but he went to church every sunday and and someone asked him i don't know how they did it but they did why do you go to church you can't see anything you can't hear anything and however he responded i don't know but he said i want to tell the world whose side i'm on hallelujah it should be the same thing with this message we want to know we want to tell the devil not just god we're on your side we'll tell satan we're not on your side but we're on your side lord jesus amen so it's here in ephesians 4 and 16. or verse 15 but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him and all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body jointly fit together and compacted by that which every joint supplier according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make it increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so that tells me that every part of the body has a function and it's a it's a necessity it's it's necessary it's not optional bits that you just tack on but every bit's important so it's not just the ministry that's important it's the helps it's important it's the it's every part of the body you know there were there were elders in the days of joshua that outlived joshua and just their very presence you read about the book of judges just their very presence kept israel on the straight and narrow it says after they died then israel went after the um gods around them so just their presence his brother so and so and he knew joshua and he was there when you know they took the land he was that generation just his presence and and that sister's presence kept the church on the straight and narrow of the word hallelujah so you say i have no function we all got to function we all have an important part to play amen see so as i say it's not like well you know you may feed one another by preaching to one another like you say oh that was peter's job to feed the sheep and feed the lambs but we all have a role to play to nurture the body we all have a very from the youngest to the oldest we all have a very important part so it's very vital that our faith goes into action now brother braham says here if i can find it i think maybe i should just print notes because it's easy to turn pages but you know he says he says in the message faith in action he says god's word is a solid rock of any faith that anybody wants to have in the supernatural it must be placed first in the word of the living god that's been through the ages how that when men of old in all ages when they would rarely find the word of god and could grasp it faith went into action right away so actually just subconsciously australia went into action when the people really grasped found the word of god and grasped it they didn't grasp a creed or a church or some movement but it was actually the word of god they grasped then faith went into action now we know that the scripture tells us that faith without works is dead now those kind of works is not not just feeding the hungry and clothing those are needy and doing good works that people say but faith is works expressed so the life that we live the things we say the things we do amen is an expression of our faith how we treat one another should be an expression of our faith right how we treat the lost and dying on the street should be an expression of our faith you know so i i ask the question the beginning we're all on the same side because what can happen is unbelief is also has a work right it's a divider it's a killer it's a terror down but i don't i'm persuaded we're not anointed with that kind of spirit [Music] we have a faith amen to to minister to one another and also to reach the lost this may be very elementary but i don't know this is just i'm maybe i'm just a bit silly sometimes i just a thought comes and i just look into it and i get happy and here i am you know but you think about the faith we have faith is a revelation it's not something we try and work up it's something that god just deposits faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god if you want faith hear the word of god that's why it's so important to get into this message and just absorb let god just pray lord the same inspiration that the prophet preached with and opened the whole book that revealed christ in his word may that same inspiration fall on me as i hear hallelujah so it's not just something you hear but something that manifests in your life you know brother braham says that the holy ghost feeds on the word that's what it feeds on so if you've received the holy ghost there's something in you that feeds on the word of god hallelujah so if we want to get big and strong with faith muscles it's good to feed amen this is a lie full of distractions but it's good to feed on the word of god hallelujah amen now on the day of pentecost that one heart one mind one accord hallelujah we can have that kind of atmosphere here every wednesday every prayer meeting you can have around your dining table wherever you have your family altar be one heart one mind one accord lord i want to see you live lord i'm hungry to see you manifest your glory lord i want to see it go from ink on paper to be a living reality hallelujah hallelujah you know that's that's that's how we should be says now a person who comes into now we are called all different kinds of things a crazy fanatica whatever you know to the general public we're considered that way or an insane person it's because we've changed dwelling place we live in a different atmosphere than the world and our one motive brother braham says and your one motive your one thought is to stay in that atmosphere any person that's ever come into that atmosphere one time is never satisfied nowhere else so when you really step into the prince of god hallelujah you want to stay there that's why we never want to leave camp hallelujah that's why there's just services that people just don't go home seems to me why because you want to stay in that atmosphere but that atmosphere can come with us wherever we go hallelujah now there's something very powerful and a group coming into one heart one my one accord you know we're facing the greatest thing to ever strike the earth which is the secret leaving of the bride remember the rapture the coming of the lord is not necessarily you know it says in revelations one every i'll see him but that's when he comes in revelations 19. right but when the bride leaves it's a secret going in a moment of twinkling right it comes like a thief in the night so there's two different kind of comings right so the one we're facing is actually a secret leaving hallelujah so now here we are in this moment of time and this little even brother ram says that that that time on on the whole ring of eternity is like a hickey you know and we'd have to get a big fat magnifying glass to go right at the end where the hickey comes back to eternity again and we're living right there that means we're living right at the end of the end of the end yes i'm glad hey if we're living in the middle we'll still push on like it's going to be tomorrow that's how we should be hallelujah but you know there's there's such a powerful thing that we possess and that is actually life in these bodies to see god live and a hunger to see him live amen atmosphere is everything atmosphere is everything i'm not saying we don't have a good atmosphere i'm just saying we can have more right so i'm not no don't ever take this as you thinking that i'm thinking that this place is dead and there's nothing here and you you no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying there's more to have we can have more we can have a greater atmosphere our brother ram says it goes all just like a faith bank rests upon the people we're all the demon spirits are cast out you know you know brother abraham says about how in the millennium the devil will be bound by a chain yeah you know the scripture says that and and he says that chain is a chain of circumstances there's no one for the devil to work through during the millennium you know we can have i but this is just me and my little silly self but you know we can have that kind of thing in our lives the devil can't use my tongue there's a chain of circumstance he can't use my mind he can't use my spirit he can't use my body he can't use my imagination my conscience my reasoning my affection he can't use any part of me because there's a chain of the holy ghost that keeps him bound that he can't he he can't work hallelujah we can have that kind of life i believe by the power of the blood you say that's unobtainable no with god all things are possible where we stay you know you know last time i was well the only time uh no the first time i was in venue you know i was in vanuatu you're flying to port villa and you go we went past the cemetery and brother adrian says you know perfect harmony in that place everyone's dead there's no fusses there's no fighting there's no trouble there's perfect harmony you know but if we reckon ourselves dead yeah i'm not i'm not living the devil shows up tries to cause some trouble i know he's dead i can't work through this guy hallelujah oh she's dead i can't work here well there's no point you know there's no point you know that's the kind of chain of circumstance no i'm not trying to be silly you know but i'm serious you know but imagine and and it's not saying we can just imagine but i believe it's a reality where where brother graham says that a man or a woman can be so surrendered to god that the devil don't know what to do with him so the devil can plague them with sickness financial trouble strife in the family strife and church strife in their personal life strive for however may be and and and somehow that person just walks right through it goes through deep valleys high mountains fire bright patches trouble you know but somehow they just get through and the devil says well that doesn't work i'll try this and then it ends up with the same result and the same trouble come you know different trouble but same result and the devil just says i just don't know what to do with this person why because they're so surrendered to god that the devil don't know what to do with them you know we know that we are not exempt from trouble but we have the answer to get us out of trouble because he is the way of escape but that but the but the source of our uh deliverance comes from an opening of the scripture to you and i because when you see yourself in the word that gives us stability in time of trouble david saw that he was king of israel he was anointed by a vindicated prophet that gave him stability it says in the scripture that you know even when saul was trying all of his antics you know that david behaved himself wisely and saw feared him all the more because he was a man that could wasn't reacting according to how saul was expecting him to react he was reacting in a different way and then saul was all more afraid this guy is different trust when the devil comes against you he'll say these people are different why didn't they fall in that trap you know it's so obvious thousands have fallen and why didn't this one fall in there's something different on the inside of the inside hallelujah but it's a but it's a source of our strength is when the scripture comes open and christ steps out of history you know he goes by i love the story of the woman at the well he goes there and they begin to have a conversation he sends off his disciples he he's already told them i need to go by the way of samaria he sits at the well because he's waiting for a vision to be fulfilled and he sees a woman walking he's seen it by vision because he says i can do nothing till the father shows me and that the father shows me i do likewise so his whole life was led by vision and so he sat there then he sees a woman walking what he saw in vision is now coming reality upon the earth now she has no idea of her place in the scripture she has no idea that she's one of them that she's an attribute of god from the foundation of the world that's expressed in flesh she has no idea but she's walking into a vision just like you and i hallelujah you know the apostle paul says the works are finished before the foundation of the world hallelujah so our overcoming the devil was already done we're just living out the vision and then so here he is sitting here she comes along she's part of the vision he just says woman bring me a drink he looks at her thinking but you're a jew i'm a samaritan we have no dealings one with another is racial segregation and trouble and all these things and you know but then he says if you really knew who i was you'd ask me for a drink and they begin to talk but then now the discussion gets religious and then she begins to say well our fathers worship yo here and you say you say you should worship in jerusalem and it's all about they were they were all living off or she was discussing what was not what is it's it's the what is that matters because it's very easy to by tradition and history to say jesus died and rose again the christian world all believes it but it's when that one steps out of history and this becomes living it becomes a love letter not a not a history in a theory you know but it becomes a living word to you and i that's a very different thing so here she was talking about things of history and you know and you know she'd say well jacob dug this well and you know she was she was discussing about what was and i'm just trying to find where i am but she was talking she had an intellectual faith of what god did in the past now the scripture tells us in james 2 that the devils believe and tremble they have a faith even so even the devils belief and quite frankly everyone who goes from this world into the next they become a believer but it's better to become a believer now because it's too late then but you know but even the devils believe in tremble but they don't have the same faith as you and i because real faith is a revelation the devils have an intellectual faith because if the devil really if the scripture was really revealed to him and he knew he was going to lose he thinks he's going to win because intellectual you know it's like christie and i play scrabble now you know she sometimes i think i'm going to win i ain't won once i don't think but she even sometimes lets me nearly win like halfway through the game i thought i've got the sewn up and then comes the end of the game i'm like 50 60 points behind you know she puts like one letter down it's like 60 points how does that work you know but it's like the devil yo god knows he's not going to win but the devil thinks i'm going to win this but if it's revealed see you know hallelujah it's got to be revealed faith must be a revelation amen if because if it's a revelation nothing can shake you from it but the devil will try and shake you from it so so she had an intellectual understanding passed down by her forebears about what god did in the past but she only was living by knowing of past revivals but she was in the process of becoming part of the revival for her day hallelujah i mean so at that point she was going to get natural water that a man dug and a lot of people live if you if you read in jeremiah we don't have the time i think it's chapter 2 where where where jeremiah says the people have done a great thing they've forsaken the fountains of living water and hewn themselves out systems broken systems and so this well basically was like a sister it's a four yes a man-made thing that's dug it's a man-made tank that collects man collected water and people drink from that instead of drinking pure artesian water and so here she was drinking from a man-made well talking about a god of history but she was talking to the god of the present right and he was the fountain of living waters and so what he wanted to do was open her eyes of understanding that she would understand that she shouldn't drink a mat water from a man-made tank or a man-made religion a man-made creed but come to the living word himself and drink the livers rivers of living water amen hallelujah because out of because jesus said the last day of the feast now we've had a feast of seven church ages was the last day of the feast jesus himself stood up and said anyone who thirsts come to me and out of them will come rivers of living water hallelujah and that's the hour we're living in so she had to she was living by something that somebody dug but now she has come to a time we should actually drink the rivers of living water that were not out of human systems but from god himself now when when she when the word began to discern her life and and and he would say go get your husband no we all know these things very well but i just wanna here we are again you know he said go get your husband and she says i don't have one and he says that's right you've had six i mean five of the one you're with is not yours you know she dropped her water pot because she said now we know where messiah cometh he'll do these things and and he just said he that speaks you he it wasn't a big seven seven hour series it wasn't a big thing sit there it was just a it's just a conversation a man and a woman talking but but the word brother says the light struck the seed and the woman and she came to life so it went from a dormant faith to a living face and she dropped her water pot her old life and she ran into the city what happened automatically faith went into action and that faith was now i've got to tell somebody that this is life that the messiah is on the earth right now he's not in the past he's not in the future he's right here and we know that the revealed word of god is messiah every generation when the word comes open that is christ of that age hallelujah amen so when the word came up and she realized this was messiah talking you know it's amazing many people heard words come out of his lips but she was the only one that said i think you're messiah hallelujah and so her faith went into action and she ran into the city said come see a man that told me all i've ever done is this not the christ this is not the messiah and then the people ran out and they and they said to him now we believe you not because of what her testimony about by the words you have said hallelujah aren't you glad we have someone to point people to i didn't say something i don't say a building where we have someone amen we have someone the ever-present water from the rock the lord jesus christ the living waters amen he's not a creed he's not a dogma he's more than a doctrine he's a living person a living being hallelujah amen brother brown would say in broken systems he said that's the way it is when you live by that fountain of living waters it's living all the time bubbling over and over and over and over there's no end to it not not go see if some water if they had rain here not long ago it's not it it's that fountain of living water as i say it gives its water free you don't have to put rags on it that's to keep all the wiggle tails out some educational rags before you send them out to preach and see if he spells his words right and speaks him right he uses it sees if he uses his nouns and his pronouns and so forth and adjectives many of them don't even know what they are but he's living at the fountain just the same just the same you don't have to depend on local reigns to fill it up or local revivals for it it don't have to that for it's a power it's a purity within itself that's where the word is its own power when a man can receive it in his heart it's got purity it's got its power it's right in the word itself it springs forth the life hallelujah amen i'm not saying youth without borders was a local revival don't get me wrong that's a worldwide revival that's the fountain coming open hallelujah but it's not just a local thing that keeps it pumped up there's something there's a force within the believer that this life comes forth hallelujah amen he said you know it's amazing when faith goes into action now faith is a very common thing we try and think it's some fandangled fancy thing but it's a very common thing when when the blood was applied in egypt on the night of passover they applied it with hyssop hyssop is just a common weed it wasn't some little flower that grew up in some mountains some faraway continent it was a weed that grew everywhere around them and if you look at weeds i don't have a photo of it but maybe i'll show it on sunday if i remember but around the back of my house i swept a pile of leaves and it's been sitting there a while and um anyway there were seeds in that pile of weeds they're all growing it'll grow wherever it can find a place to grow faith will grow how it just needs a little bit of soil and it'll grow so to apply the blood because i had to apply the blood with this hyssop it was just common faith it wasn't a big fandangle thing just a common faith so the faith that goes into action it's a common faith hallelujah amen now he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him it says in hebrews 11 6 but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him who believes that tonight he's actually a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so that's what i say from the beginning it's not some passive thing turn it on turn it off pause it just watch it be brainy and what no it's actually it's actually a relationship but so if he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i mean then i trust that re that's a revelation that's actually sunk into your heart he will reward me if i diligently seek him i know it may be very elementary but he's actually a we believe that he is we've seen that he is we still see that he is hallelujah and he is a rewarder of them to diligently seek him so so if he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i want my reward now i'm not talking about i'm not talking about natural things on this site i'm talking about his kingdom being established his kingdom going forward to me that's a reward i just want to see him live that's all i'm interested in i want to see god save people deliver people cast the devil out heal the sick raise the dead start a revival pour himself into each and every one of us refill us that already have the holy ghost fill those who don't have the holy ghost turn a dead heart into a hungry heart amen give a satisfying portion to each one amen fill the hunger that people just consumed become addicted you know you know there's you know there's addiction centers that people gather like alcoholics anonymous you know narcotics anonymous and they talk about their problem and they try and support each other from keeping away from things and it was actually built on christian principles once upon a time now this is not an alcoholics anonymous where or or a jesus anonymous where we're trying to support each other to keep away from the spirit of god in the word of god it's actually the opposite this is an this is an addiction center where addicts come hallelujah no i'm not i trust you're not offended if i call you an addict hallelujah hallelujah because we're addicted to something hey man hallelujah once i was i was up to my eyeballs in the world i was addicted to stuff of the world i was addicted to spirits in the world i remember then one day jesus came my way through the word i was listening to this message i realized i needed the holy ghost and i really needed to meet him not just some feeling or sensation but me the person of the word and she changed my life but i became an addict of something else hallelujah so where's that i'm an addict how many days have been cleaned zero hallelujah i don't want a single day well i can say he didn't live today in some form hallelujah so you know we're addicts aren't we and we should fuel each other's habit hallelujah you know in the world i was bad for my friends and they are bad for me because i was feeding each other's habit of different things but there's a different kind of addiction hallelujah man these people are dealers absolutely hallelujah that's how we should be should we with this word amen how does every joint supply the knee of the other become a dealer amen hallelujah what are you pushing pills no gospels that's what i'm pushing hallelujah change our lives that's how we should be we're all on the same team how can we get each other high in the holy ghost hallelujah amen but shouldn't that be our motivation why do we come to church it's not just for ourselves we want to create an atmosphere of faith where someone else may be going through the biggest trial of their life but they walk through the doors and they feel the atmosphere of the holy ghost come down and it and their burdens and their troubles don't seem so heavy anymore because the comforter and the guide and the counselor is right here to meet their needs and they sit under the shady trees of fellowship you know how many people have you know how many times like myself you're all twisted and tied up then you go sit down with a believer what what happens you're sitting under the shady trees of fellowship hallelujah and even just subconsciously now the holy ghost begins to give you a bit of shade and a bit of rest hallelujah then you walk from under that shade tree and say i'm feeling pretty good hallelujah why because fella it's actually the holy ghost doing a work as the same thing with you and i when we come to church yeah we join our faith together lord speak to everyone here and this is not this is not pitchforking now because pitchforking is oh they better get that and i hope they got this no that's not what i'm talking about lord meet every need and divine presence touch each one of us oh god mend every heart meet every need may the past just be kicked to the side and give us strength given encouragement to god by virtue come forth amen before the first song is sung and the last prayer is prayed amen in between that time god come down then when we have lunch lord come and minister to one another lord come and speak supernaturally even just by actions and deeds lord minister to each heart amen that's how we should be and that's what i mean by being a dealer oh look because you want to see we want to see each of each everybody's drunk on the holy ghost hallelujah yes i've been literally drunk intoxicated by the holy ghost i realized this is how it felt like when i was drunk in the world but there's no perverseness amen there's all the all the greatness i mean all the feelings but it was just pure hallelujah staggering around hey that's what if it's in the scripture then it's for us right oh but we're we have matured no i never want to you know you see a tree who knows what photosynthesis is okay if you have no greenery you can't absorb sunlight and convert it to energy that's how greenery is green they have you know so so it absorbs sunlight draws moisture up from the atmosphere and through its roots and nutrients and it grows if you cut all the greenery off a tree it can't absorb any sunlight and actually use it as energy so i never want to get too stiff and starchy set in my ways that i'm not a green tree anymore i'm not talking about being green as an immature aren't green as inflexible hallelujah that i can still absorb the sunlight of the s-o-n that the word doesn't become common and well i've heard that i've heard that quote before i've heard that scripture before i've heard that arrangement of songs before just because we never wanted to become common i remember whatever where the atmosphere of faith being built in the church that he can do beyond what we can ask or think you know i think it's brother said it you know we should pray ask the lord to loose our tongues things that we can't even imagine want to pray lord go beyond what we imagine and just take these vocal chords and speak forth what you want spoken hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'm gonna because time is you know you know eternity's going to be cool amen you know but i just pray lord may our faith go into action everything we do we should do in faith how we raise our children it's actually in faith lord this is actually going to affect them it's going to be positive on them that your word is going to put in flesh i'm going to create an atmosphere lord i believe actually by you doing it through me that that they're going to receive the holy ghost you know it was a year ago since annelise and lilia and and malachi hey they got baptized a year ago level three lockdown you know how that came about we had a we had a zoom meeting and i and and and i remember you know preaching about the um uh you know the uh raising the flag and time of trouble and you know those things yeah you know where the americans put on erojima put their flag up on that mountain and there's still the japanese shooting and everything but they put their banner up anyway that's how we should be inspired the enemy shooting at us let's put our banner up and you know you know you know coming out of lockdown that was you know not being locked down and putting out treasures in the attic and all those things you know and then after that we prayed and there was such an atmosphere in the home that the lord came down spoke in tongues interpretation and and said my child i know what you've been thinking about on your bed i am calling you i think the lord said basically come to me and i'll fill you with the holy ghost now annelise was would would would lie in her bed now there's her testimony lilia's but analysts would lie in her bed thinking is this man calling me or god calling me and then the atmosphere was right not by anything we did humanly but just god being sovereign in his grace and the lord answered a question without even christine knowing it or i knowing it hallelujah why do those things happen it increases our faith that's why brother owen says about the discernment you know that didn't heal the people he says the lord healed you on calvary but it's to elevate your faith to receive the promise of god i mean it should be the same thing here in service that our faith should be elevated because of the atmosphere that we can actually get what we need hallelujah [Music] amen so here we are hallelujah let's let's let's take church you know anything can happen we don't need camp for anything to happen
