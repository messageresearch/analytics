[5:12] you, brother Josh. Thank you, musicians.
[5:14] Amen. God bless you all. Amen. Um, so
[5:17] just one announcement just as you want
[5:20] to take your Bibles. Um, so we've got
[5:22] new church cards in the back with our
[5:23] updated website address on it. Like to
[5:25] thank brother Ed very much for putting
[5:26] the website together and uh bring that
[5:29] all together. So we appreciate that.
[5:30] We're going to be adding to it as we go.
[5:31] But yeah, so if you got old cards, uh,
[5:34] just throw them out because we don't
[5:35] have that website anymore. That's a
[5:36] whole story in itself, but we'll get
[5:38] anyway. We had a new one. We needed a
[5:40] new one. So maybe that was just the
[5:42] push. I don't know. But all things work
[5:44] together for good.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you all. Let's turn
[5:47] to Genesis chapter 3. Just want to read
[5:50] a couple of verses uh here and then
[5:52] we're going to go to Isaiah um chapter
[5:56] 53. I know this is probably familiar
[5:58] scriptures to all of us, but just wanted
[6:00] to read these. And uh you know, I I went
[6:02] and saw brother Phil today and uh he was
[6:05] getting well maybe I shouldn't say it,
[6:06] but I'll say it. He was getting 60 odd
[6:08] staples pulled out of his wound and and
[6:11] this kind of got me on this whole
[6:13] thought of wounds. I don't have any
[6:15] pictures. Okay, I wouldn't show them,
[6:16] but you know, but so yeah, this is what
[6:18] I'm going to talk about. So, uh, Genesis
[6:21] 3 and 14, it says, "And the Lord God
[6:24] said unto the serpent, because thou has
[6:25] done this, thou art cursed above all
[6:27] cattle, and above every beast of the
[6:29] field, upon thy belly thou shalt go, and
[6:32] thus shall they eat all the days of thy
[6:33] life. And I'll put enmity between thee
[6:36] and the woman, and between thy seed and
[6:38] her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and
[6:40] thou shalt bruise his heel." There's
[6:42] going to be wounding that's going to
[6:43] happen. And when God promises something,
[6:45] it's going to happen. And it did. And we
[6:47] praise the Lord for it. Amen. So, and
[6:49] then we go to Isaiah chapter 53. And um
[6:53] we're just going to read here.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; I actually have it, sorry, on the um I
[6:58] have it on the uh projector if you, you
[7:01] know, to save you time. But here we are.
[7:05] Isaiah 53. Going to read verses 2 to 6.
[7:07] Uh you we could read the whole thing.
[7:09] We're just going to read these verses
[7:11] here. It says, "And he shall grow up
[7:14] before him as a tender plant and as a
[7:16] root out of a dry ground. He hath no
[7:18] form nor comeliness that when we shall
[7:20] see him there is no beauty that we
[7:22] should desire him. He is despised and
[7:24] rejected of men. A man of sorrows,
[7:26] acquainted with grief, and we hid as it
[7:28] were our faces from him. He was despised
[7:30] and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath
[7:33] bore our griefs and carried our sorrows.
[7:35] Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten
[7:38] of God, and afflicted. But he was
[7:40] wounded for our transgressions. He was
[7:41] bruised for our iniquities. The
[7:43] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[7:45] And with his stripes we are healed. All
[7:48] we like sheep have gone astray. We have
[7:50] turned everyone to his own way. And the
[7:52] Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[7:54] all. Amen. What a powerful scripture.
[7:57] Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[7:59] prayer tonight. If you have need, you
[8:00] just want to raise your hand. Say, Lord,
[8:01] remember me at this time. Speak to my
[8:03] life, Lord Jesus. Cuz he's a personal
[8:04] God, isn't he? Amen. Hallelujah. We're
[8:07] so thankful for that. Let's pray.
[8:08] Gracious heavenly father, as we bow our
[8:10] heads in your presence once again, we
[8:12] just want to give you thanks, Lord, for
[8:14] all you have done. We praise your great
[8:16] name, Lord Jesus. Thank you that you are
[8:18] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[8:19] Thank you. You're faithful and true. And
[8:21] as we have read your great eternal word,
[8:23] Lord, we ask once again. May you anoint
[8:25] it to our hearts, Lord. Not just the
[8:27] hearers here. Anoint it to my heart,
[8:29] Lord. Anoint it to those who are
[8:30] watching by the way of YouTube, Lord
[8:32] Jesus. Just be all of our abundant
[8:34] portion. We love you so much. We commit
[8:36] our lives into your hands asking Lord
[8:38] that you'll raise our faith Lord Jesus.
[8:40] Lord may you just uh bring a greater
[8:42] stability in our lives. May you just
[8:43] manifest yourself in a greater way Lord
[8:45] through us Lord as we Lord Lord from uh
[8:48] from before we left I mean before we
[8:50] came in this place to when we leave at
[8:52] the end Lord may there be a change in
[8:53] our lives going from glory to glory and
[8:55] be those who are streaming as well be
[8:57] their portion in Jesus Christ's name.
[8:59] Amen.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you friends. You can
[9:01] have your seats uh tonight. So, I want
[9:04] to talk about wounds now. Oh, wait.
[9:08] I'm pushing the wrong screen here. I
[9:10] want to talk about wounds.
[9:12] I mean, a wound is inflicted by a sharp
[9:14] or a a a hard object striking you,
[9:16] cutting you, damaging you in some way.
[9:19] And this is not just in the uh uh in the
[9:21] in the natural, but it's also speaking
[9:23] about spiritual wounds. Now, we read
[9:25] there in Genesis chapter 3 that God
[9:27] promised a wounding. Amen. There would
[9:29] be a wounding that would take place
[9:30] where the the the seed of the woman
[9:33] which we know is Christ would crush or
[9:35] bruise the head of the seed of the
[9:36] serpent and then that serpent in in turn
[9:39] would would would bruise his heel. So
[9:41] there was a wounding that would take
[9:42] place on both sides. Now we uh
[9:45] understand that the fulfillment of this
[9:47] prophecy was that day on Calvary where
[9:49] where Christ was was was was bruised in
[9:52] his heel. He was marred more than any
[9:53] other man. But the head of the of the
[9:56] serpent was crushed or bruised that day.
[9:58] That word bruise means crushed and I
[10:00] like crushed more. I like think of my
[10:01] enemy being crushed under his feet.
[10:03] Amen. So, so there was a wounding. Now,
[10:05] wounds wounds work both ways. They can
[10:08] they can either uh manifest God or they
[10:11] can or Satan will try and get into those
[10:13] same wounds and try and manifest, try
[10:16] and manifest his character. But it all
[10:18] depends on which way we allow it to go.
[10:20] Like it says in Hebrews about, you know,
[10:22] don't let a root of bitterness grow in
[10:23] you. You know, because there was a
[10:25] wound. In order for business to come in,
[10:26] there has to be a wound to to to come in
[10:29] cuz uh you know who's ever had an uh
[10:32] infected wound. It may go red may you
[10:35] know be a bit inflamed or something
[10:37] that's infection trying to come in. Now
[10:39] what happens is is is God allows wounds
[10:42] to happen and he allows them to happen
[10:44] that his glory would be made known. And
[10:46] like we have here Joby sitting he's
[10:48] covered in boils his friends or you know
[10:50] you know the picture's cropped but you
[10:52] know his three three friends are coming
[10:53] to visit him to basically tell him he's
[10:55] wrong and you know so but you see he was
[10:58] wounded.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; God permitted the wounding.
[11:02] God told en uh Job's enemy and his enemy
[11:05] Job's a perfect man and basically Satan
[11:08] said well the only reason he loves you
[11:10] is because everything's going fine. In
[11:11] other words he's never had a wound.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; That's why he serves you. That's why you
[11:15] could testify him about him this way.
[11:17] But but because God knew Job's future,
[11:19] he could because he knew Job's past, he
[11:21] could uh because remember he was with
[11:23] God before the foundation of the world.
[11:24] Amen. So God could actually testify to
[11:26] his enemy, do what you Well, you can do
[11:29] certain things, but you can't take his
[11:31] life. You can't touch him. We know he
[11:33] came to, you know, the first time he
[11:35] wasn't allowed to touch Job. Second time
[11:37] he could make him sick, but he couldn't
[11:38] take his life. And basically God was
[11:40] basically telling the enemy these wounds
[11:43] that you're I'm allowing you to inflict
[11:45] upon Job, they're not going to change
[11:47] Job in terms of the fact that he's going
[11:49] to become an unbeliever. He's going to
[11:51] curse me to my face. That was uh could
[11:53] not happen. Right? So, so Job's wounds
[11:56] actually brought out good in his life.
[11:58] You say, well, how did it bring out
[11:59] good? Well, before the tr before the
[12:01] wounding, he would say, well, I see in
[12:03] in nature, you know, the flowers come
[12:05] forth, they die, then they come back
[12:06] again the next season. And you know, he
[12:08] saw death, burial, resurrection in
[12:09] nature. But he says, "Man dies. Where
[12:11] does he go?
[12:12] &gt;&gt; He's not like a tree. He's not like a
[12:13] flower. He's just he just goes, gives up
[12:15] the ghost. Where does he go?" And this
[12:17] was his main question in life. What
[12:19] happens after my last breath leaves my
[12:21] body?
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Where am I going? But so God would allow
[12:25] wounding to come into his life that he
[12:26] could stand and say, "Now I know my
[12:28] redeemer liveth." Amen. And with these
[12:30] eyes, I shall see God. I'll stand with
[12:32] him on the last days of the earth. Amen.
[12:34] So his wounding actually opened heaven
[12:36] to him.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually gave him a mighty
[12:38] revelation.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see the enemy
[12:42] wanted to use those same wounds to make
[12:44] Job curse God to his face. But you see,
[12:47] no those wounds actually brought out
[12:49] where God would actually because of
[12:50] those wounds, God would ask Job, "Where
[12:52] were you when the morning stars shouted
[12:54] for joy and the foundation world was
[12:56] formed? Where were you, Job?" And God
[12:58] through those wounds was trying to tell
[12:59] Job, Job, you were with me. in my mind
[13:01] before there's anything I thought of
[13:03] you, Job. And it wasn't with these
[13:05] wounds. It was with in in an eternal
[13:07] body dancing, rejoicing, and shouting
[13:10] because how God thought of Job in the
[13:11] beginning is how he's going to end up in
[13:13] the end. And those wounds weren't going
[13:14] to stop it.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing in our lives,
[13:17] friends. We're all being wounded.
[13:19] We've all been hurt. We've been
[13:20] betrayed. We've been backstabbed. We've
[13:22] been lied on. We've been, you know,
[13:23] ridiculed. We've been rejected. We've
[13:25] all been wounded.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; But why are we still believers?
[13:29] There's something greater in you than
[13:30] your wound. I mean, there's something
[13:32] greater in you than than than what man
[13:34] could do to you or a spirit would try
[13:36] and afflict you with. There's something
[13:37] far greater in you than those things.
[13:40] And we'll come to that later. Amen. But
[13:43] you see what happens is the enemy always
[13:44] tries to bring, I could say, infection
[13:47] into the wound where God wants to reveal
[13:49] himself. The devil wants to come in and
[13:51] try and mess it up just to taint it a
[13:53] little bit because he loves man, our
[13:56] enemy. Let's just read this like this
[13:59] for example. Likewise, the spirit
[14:00] although also helpeth our infirmities,
[14:02] for we know not what we should pray as
[14:05] we uh for as we ought, but the spirit
[14:07] itself maketh intercession for us with
[14:09] groanings that cannot be uttered. Amen.
[14:12] So when you get wounded, you just let
[14:13] the spirit of God pray through you and
[14:16] it can really it can really manifest or
[14:18] utter really what that wound has done.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that searchth the hearts
[14:23] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[14:25] because he maketh intercession for the
[14:27] saints according to the will of God. And
[14:30] we know that all things work together
[14:31] for good to them that love God and to
[14:33] them that are called according to his
[14:35] purpose. Now the enemy wants to come in
[14:38] and because we can look at things and
[14:40] say this is working for my good.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Do you understand how? No. Do I need to
[14:45] understand how? No. We walk by faith not
[14:48] by sight. I don't walk with God because
[14:50] I understand everything. I don't walk
[14:52] with God because I've seen my life
[14:55] mapped out every day of what's going to
[14:56] happen. No, I walk with him because he's
[15:00] revealed himself to me and he's a
[15:02] faithful shepherd and he will see me
[15:04] through.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; He's proved his word in my life. Amen.
[15:07] So, we don't walk with him because we
[15:09] know all things or understand all
[15:11] things. Things will happen like Job
[15:12] didn't even understand what happened to
[15:14] him. And God never took the time to
[15:16] explain to him that that that he had a
[15:18] testimony meeting with with Satan before
[15:20] this happened.
[15:22] You don't read it in the book of Job.
[15:24] God's not obligated to tell us
[15:26] everything. And that's okay. I don't
[15:28] mind. He can do what he wants. He's God.
[15:31] I'm me. He's God. I've I've got the
[15:33] hierarchy right. You know, anyway. So,
[15:36] you know, so so things will happen and
[15:37] we don't understand why. Well, we've got
[15:39] to realize it's working for our good.
[15:41] But then the enemy wants to come in
[15:44] because remember trouble, brother says
[15:46] that God harnesses trouble, puts bits in
[15:49] its mouth and causes it to bring us
[15:51] closer to God, right? He he allows
[15:54] wounds to come in not because he wasn't
[15:56] displeased with Job. Job didn't put a
[15:59] foot wrong. He was a perfect man, right?
[16:01] God wasn't embellishing his testimony
[16:03] about Job to the enemy.
