[49:38] we've got fellowship lunch unfortunately
[49:41] we couldn't get the ball which we
[49:43] normally have it's been booked i was
[49:45] booked already but um but our home is
[49:48] open also the Clifford's open their home
[49:50] so we're gonna kind of divide into two
[49:51] and have some wonderful fellowship a man
[49:55] who loves the Lord this morning I mean
[49:57] there's got a First Samuel 22 and then
[49:59] we're gonna go to second Corinthians so
[50:03] first samuel 22 and verses we're just
[50:06] going to read verses 1 and 2 it says
[50:08] David therefore departed thence the
[50:11] David's now on the run and escape to the
[50:14] cave
[50:15] Abdulla and when his brethren and all of
[50:19] his father's house heard it they went
[50:21] down hitherto to him and everyone that
[50:24] was in distress and everyone that was in
[50:27] debt and everyone that was discontented
[50:29] gathered themselves under him and he
[50:32] became a captain over them and there
[50:34] were with him about 400 men I mean
[50:39] unless go to second Corinthians chapter
[50:41] 3 this is I pray this is a very familiar
[50:44] piece of Scripture to everyone it is not
[50:47] just a scripture you maybe have in your
[50:49] mind but you're living it out I mean the
[50:53] second Corinthians 3 we're going to read
[50:54] verses 15 to 18 but unto this day when
[51:01] Moses is read the veil is upon their
[51:04] heart
[51:05] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[51:08] Lord the veil shall be taken away
[51:12] so we are someone who's not turn to the
[51:16] Lord there's a veil over there bail over
[51:18] them right upon me heart now the Lord is
[51:22] that spirit and where the Spirit of the
[51:24] Lord is there is Liberty but we all with
[51:27] open face beholding as in a glass the
[51:29] glory the Lord are changed into the same
[51:32] image from glory to glory even by the
[51:35] Spirit of the Lord Amen may the Lord
[51:39] bless his word this morning you may have
[51:41] your seats and I want to talk about
[51:43] God's transforming power now I want to
[51:48] lay out a few things just just first now
[51:51] we read we read here and Samuel about
[51:56] David and all the ones that gathered to
[51:58] him and I'm going to refer to this but I
[52:00] want to say that they were those people
[52:02] together today but were transformed
[52:04] they became David's mighty mean so they
[52:07] were the state they started and was not
[52:09] the state they finished in right they
[52:12] came in debt discontented distressed
[52:15] whatever state but they became David's
[52:17] mighty men they were transformed right
[52:20] because David David's life of becoming
[52:23] King was actually prophecy and they knew
[52:26] that he was coming into power to become
[52:28] king and the same anointing that same
[52:31] word that came upon David came upon them
[52:33] and have made them David's mighty men
[52:35] now to be transformed the word well
[52:39] let's start with it says we're to spread
[52:40] Lord is there is Liberty now this does
[52:43] not mean we can do whatever we wish to
[52:45] do that is not the Liberty it's speaking
[52:47] of but in the Greek it means freedom and
[52:49] the root word of this is and all as
[52:52] unrestrained
[52:53] which means to go at pleasure that is at
[52:56] a citizen not a slave so you become free
[52:59] born so it means to be at liberty it
[53:01] means you're not a slave anymore you are
[53:03] not you're not a slave but you're a
[53:05] Freeborn citizen I mean see you have
[53:08] change from being a slave a slave you're
[53:10] not dictate can I go can I come can I do
[53:12] what I want no you're a slave you're
[53:15] under a slave master you're told what to
[53:17] do and you have no choice what you can
[53:20] do what you cannot do but those who are
[53:22] citizens are no longer slaves what
[53:24] they've been doing chain
[53:26] I mean living transformed and in for a
[53:28] slave to us to a citizen so we're the
[53:31] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[53:32] that a people can go as citizens of the
[53:36] kingdom of God and not slaves under
[53:37] Satan right so we are free we are free
[53:40] born we are not bound by the enemy or
[53:43] his devices hallelujah so so now and
[53:47] also now as we're beholding we all with
[53:49] an open face beholding as in a glass the
[53:51] glory of the Lord now an open face means
[53:54] an unveiled face and if there's no veil
[53:56] of tradition there's no veil of man's
[53:58] ideas and then when brother Brad
[54:00] preaches swim and the mighty God on bow
[54:02] before us as not just a nice idea was
[54:05] declaring that the mighty God of the
[54:07] Bible the Lord Jesus Christ is unveiled
[54:09] himself in this hour through his word
[54:11] and he's he's manifested himself in
[54:13] front of you I mean so when we see this
[54:15] message I mean manifested I mean that's
[54:18] God making himself known to a generation
[54:21] a minute when we behold him as he is we
[54:24] are trained from glory to glory amen
[54:26] into the same image so we had
[54:29] transformed I mean from what we were in
[54:31] the beginning and we're transformed from
[54:33] glory to glory into the image of God I
[54:36] mean so we become the living
[54:38] manifestation of his word hallelujah so
[54:41] that's what it means now we're not we're
[54:43] not beholding him through a veil trying
[54:45] to work out what he's like and what he
[54:47] doesn't like it his nature and his
[54:48] character and how he operates we're not
[54:51] we're now looking through that kind of
[54:52] veil the veils being taken off power
[54:55] your whole traditions have been stripped
[54:56] away man's ideas man's Creed's man's
[54:59] whatever it may be we're not looking
[55:01] through that kind of oh yeah well anyway
[55:04] what does this mean does this mean this
[55:05] does this mean that God just said this
[55:07] is what my word is I mean god interprets
[55:10] his word by bringing it to posture God
[55:12] proves his word by manifesting the truth
[55:15] of it
[55:16] hallelujah so now I say if you cannot
[55:20] but if you are still veiled in your
[55:22] heart you cannot be changed from glory
[55:24] to glory I mean that's why that veil
[55:26] must be done away with he must be born
[55:29] again I'm in the and yeah if you're not
[55:32] born again you cannot see or understand
[55:35] or comprehend the kingdom of God
[55:38] make sense right if you cannot really
[55:41] see what you're looking at it doesn't
[55:42] make sense to you and the more someone
[55:44] tries to explain it the more frustrated
[55:46] you'll become right but if you can
[55:48] really see you can understand it you can
[55:50] comprehend it that means you've been
[55:52] born again that means you can you can
[55:53] really understand what you're looking at
[55:56] hallelujah so now we are being
[56:00] transformed right I'm not talking about
[56:03] something in the future the word now is
[56:05] transforming a bride hallelujah and I'll
[56:09] just drop this in from the get-go the
[56:11] reason David became King as in him was
[56:13] to be king and him was the kingship and
[56:16] him was to be on the throne before he
[56:18] was even a shepherd boy he was ordained
[56:20] to be king right gifts and callings of
[56:23] God are without repentance are
[56:26] irrevocable what God has declared a
[56:28] person will be they will be hallelujah
[56:31] trust in your election God's called me
[56:33] cause he lectured me to a certain
[56:35] position doesn't matter what the
[56:37] buzzards say then they say say that
[56:38] critics say I'm on my way to Canaan
[56:41] freely I'm on my way up into the New
[56:43] Jerusalem
[56:44] hallelujah be made I mean I've been
[56:46] predestinated to be conformed to the
[56:48] image of his son which is the image of
[56:50] his word hallelujah
[56:52] if God's made me last times us go argue
[56:56] with him about it please go why are you
[57:01] talking to me about a go talk to him I
[57:03] mean I am his workmanship you know have
[57:07] you ever seen someone maybe some people
[57:08] do maybe they're funny in their mind
[57:10] they see a masterpiece on the wall and
[57:12] they begin to argue at the painting
[57:14] you're wrong
[57:15] this is painted your your Arrangements
[57:18] wrong your compositions around the
[57:20] colors on your wrong if you have seen
[57:22] someone argue at their painting thank
[57:24] you thank you who they go take it up
[57:26] with the artist but people come and
[57:28] haven't got the painting right
[57:32] they say they accuse you they say I know
[57:34] you're wrong this is wrong this is not
[57:36] true I say no talk to him about it
[57:38] I'm just the painting
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] hallelujah we are we have been
[57:46] predestinated to be conformed to the
[57:48] image of a son which is the word amen to
[57:51] the word transformed that's where we get
[57:54] the word metamorphosis from there's a
[57:57] transformation to change from one thing
[57:59] to another right just like you know a
[58:02] butterfly doesn't start off as a
[58:03] butterfly it starts off as a caterpillar
[58:06] but then goes through a metamorphosis
[58:07] goes through a transformation but in it
[58:10] is to be a butterfly all it has to do is
[58:12] walk along and eat the leaf and be a
[58:15] caterpillar but eat and eat and eat
[58:16] Anita me and then eventually the life
[58:18] and it transforms itself right is the
[58:21] same thing with the Bride of Christ
[58:22] we've received amen brother Bram says
[58:25] that the shout he says in the rapture
[58:27] measures a shot as the Living bread
[58:29] which brings forth the living bride and
[58:31] then to the word it's just like your
[58:33] honor it's like the caterpillar eats the
[58:35] leaf becomes a butterfly the bride eats
[58:38] the word and it brings forth the living
[58:40] bride right this message will bring
[58:42] forth a living bright and it has and it
[58:46] is you are the proof people want to see
[58:49] vindication look at you look what the
[58:51] believer look at what God has done for
[58:53] you
[58:54] hallelujah you want proof amen a
[58:59] testimony is evidence that the word is
[59:01] true a real testimony is proof that the
[59:05] word is true right that's what a
[59:07] testimony is and God is testifying in
[59:11] the believer my word is truth
[59:12] they believe they took me at my word
[59:14] that's all you're gonna do take God at
[59:16] His Word right don't look at me now just
[59:18] take out of this word amen and faith it
[59:21] will produce what it says it will
[59:22] produce
[59:24] alleluiah so to be transformed it means
[59:26] to go through a metamorphosis amen
[59:30] so those who are free so we're the
[59:34] spirit of Lord is there's Liberty we're
[59:35] no longer slaves right the Lord is by
[59:38] the blood of Jesus Christ is loosed us
[59:40] from our sin amen we have been freed
[59:42] right we're no longer the people we once
[59:44] were you may be bound up and religion
[59:47] wherever you're from it doesn't matter
[59:48] what are you now what if God done for
[59:51] you I mean where have you come from and
[59:53] where are you now I'm not worried I'm
[59:55] not what I used to be hallelujah I may
[59:58] not be what I want to be yes right this
[1:00:01] and it's full manifestation but I'm
[1:00:03] thank God I'm not what I used to be I'm
[1:00:06] being changed from glory to glory I mean
[1:00:09] what you what you behold is what you
[1:00:11] become right if you behold atheism
[1:00:16] you'll become an atheist right if you
[1:00:19] behold critics voices you'll become a
[1:00:21] critic if you behold the voice of God
[1:00:24] you'll become the living manifestation
[1:00:25] of the Bible amen now Paul says in 2nd
[1:00:31] Corinthians three and one and three he
[1:00:35] sees down well I'll say this so those
[1:00:37] who are free behold the Lord with
[1:00:39] unveiled eyes and they are transformed
[1:00:41] their change from into his image and he
[1:00:45] is the word amen so you become
[1:00:48] transformed from glory glory to glory
[1:00:51] being made into the Living
[1:00:53] manifestations of his word that's what
[1:00:56] the bride becomes and the Apostle Paul
[1:00:59] puts it this way he says do we begin
[1:01:02] again to commend ourselves or need we as
[1:01:05] some others epistles of combination
[1:01:09] to you or letters of condemnation from
[1:01:14] you ye are our epistle written in our
[1:01:16] hearts known and read of all men for as
[1:01:19] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[1:01:21] the Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[1:01:23] written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:01:26] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:01:28] but in the fleshly tables of the hearts
[1:01:31] he's saying that they are the
[1:01:33] manifestation of the word that they have
[1:01:35] preached
[1:01:35] right they have become the living
[1:01:39] manifestation of what they preach right
[1:01:40] and that is what the truth the true
[1:01:43] believer receives the word by faith into
[1:01:45] their hearts and it produces what is
[1:01:47] ministered to them hallelujah now
[1:01:51] brother Bram says in the mighty God I'm
[1:01:53] available for theses and Jesus said as
[1:01:55] it was the days of Sodom so shall it be
[1:01:59] at the coming of the Son of Man deity
[1:02:01] veiled again and human flesh now
[1:02:03] remember Jesus didn't say when the Son
[1:02:05] of God is revealed and Luke the 17th
[1:02:07] chapter I believe about the twenty 21st
[1:02:09] verse somewhere along they said but when
[1:02:11] the Son of Man is revealed the son of
[1:02:13] man back in the church again revealed
[1:02:16] and human beings
[1:02:18] he didn't say reveal in human being one
[1:02:20] revealed in human beings so in the Son
[1:02:23] of Man Jesus Christ is back in the
[1:02:25] church again revealed in human beings
[1:02:29] right so the you know many times we take
[1:02:32] Luke 17 thirty that will when the Son of
[1:02:34] Man being revealed of course that was
[1:02:36] manifested in the prophets ministry but
[1:02:38] it's not just manifested there I'm in
[1:02:40] the son of man ministry is continuing on
[1:02:42] in the Bride of Christ hallelujah so now
[1:02:45] he is revealed in human beings if he is
[1:02:48] in you he is being revealed in your
[1:02:50] flesh right when people see you they
[1:02:52] should see Jesus they may not understand
[1:02:54] what they're looking at they may not be
[1:02:56] able to say what do you believe this
[1:02:57] away you this way but when they're
[1:02:59] looking at you they see Jesus hallelujah
[1:03:01] that's how it should be that God deity
[1:03:04] is veiled in human flesh once again
[1:03:07] Alleluia and that's why the that's why
[1:03:10] Paul said in first Corinthians 11 when
[1:03:12] he's speaking about when he's speaking
[1:03:14] about communion he says for he that
[1:03:16] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:03:17] and drinketh damnation to himself not
[1:03:19] discerning the Lord's body he's talking
[1:03:22] about the body of the Lord as the people
[1:03:25] right people are not discerning the
[1:03:27] Lord's body and I'll and I'll say it's
[1:03:29] very simply because we are not meat to
[1:03:32] be knowing after the flesh right we
[1:03:38] don't know it we shouldn't know each
[1:03:39] other by personality and this is where
[1:03:40] you're from this is what they got caught
[1:03:42] up with Jesus he's from Nazareth this is
[1:03:44] his mom this is a sibling sisters here
[1:03:46] this is where he's from
[1:03:48] you know you know
[1:03:49] and his own people were caught up in his
[1:03:51] humanity but when it was God made flesh
[1:03:53] but those who could look beyond the veil
[1:03:56] of his humanity saw Messiah right the
[1:03:59] woman at the well didn't say you're a
[1:04:01] Jew from Nazareth therefore your Messiah
[1:04:03] she said we know we're Messiah cometh he
[1:04:05] will do these things right so she looked
[1:04:07] beyond the veil of his humanity and knew
[1:04:10] him as Messiah right
[1:04:12] hallelujah just like the Apostle Paul
[1:04:14] you'd look at him you'd say here comes
[1:04:16] the hook-nosed Jewry comes you know how
[1:04:18] every you know presents himself
[1:04:20] those who look beyond the valves of his
[1:04:23] humanity saw God revealing himself now
[1:04:32] sees here in Romans 12 I beseech you
[1:04:35] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[1:04:36] that you present your bodies a living
[1:04:38] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:04:40] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:04:43] conformed to this world but be
[1:04:44] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:04:47] that you may prove that what is that
[1:04:49] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:04:51] God says don't be conformed to the
[1:04:53] thinking of this world do not be
[1:04:54] conformed to this world don't let the
[1:04:56] the world with its cookie cutter pattern
[1:04:58] of whatever be stepped upon you but be
[1:05:01] transformed then your thinking go
[1:05:03] through a metamorphosis I mean from
[1:05:05] being just thinking about culture and
[1:05:07] this is me and this is my family then
[1:05:09] you begin to think no I'm a child of God
[1:05:11] holy I be made in His image I mean I'm
[1:05:14] going I came from eternity I'm going
[1:05:16] back to eternity hallelujah that's how
[1:05:20] it should be now brother parenthesis and
[1:05:24] the power of transformation God's power
[1:05:27] to transform rather he says but brother
[1:05:29] there's one thing I can brag on I can
[1:05:31] brag on my Lord Jesus who has redeemed
[1:05:33] me and with this transforming power
[1:05:35] planted a seed by predestination and I
[1:05:38] saw it whose son am I now yeah I can
[1:05:41] brag on him and I have spent 33 years of
[1:05:44] my life bragging on him if he could
[1:05:47] spare me another 33 years old bragged
[1:05:49] more on him see I can brag on my
[1:05:51] ancestor hallelujah he that redeem him
[1:05:54] planted the seed of life in here and let
[1:05:56] me look down upon this word sit down his
[1:05:59] spirit said here it is speak this and
[1:06:01] this will
[1:06:01] and do that oh my I can brag on him how
[1:06:04] did he do that through the washing of
[1:06:06] the water by the word the waters of
[1:06:08] separation
[1:06:09] he said whisker we wish we could explain
[1:06:12] it true predestinated believers will
[1:06:14] stay with the word because they're part
[1:06:16] of that word since I wandering stars how
[1:06:19] long were you wonder you Methodist
[1:06:20] Baptist Presbyterian Outsiders whatever
[1:06:22] you might be wondering stars from church
[1:06:24] to church from pillar to place
[1:06:26] television to television world to world
[1:06:29] why don't you come on he longs to have
[1:06:31] fellowship with you he's longing for you
[1:06:34] he wants to transform you by the
[1:06:35] renewing of your mind not to the church
[1:06:38] or to the denomination but to his word I
[1:06:40] mean which you're a part of that desire
[1:06:43] is in you blessed are they that do
[1:06:45] hunger and thirst for righteousness for
[1:06:47] they shall be filled and it's sent his
[1:06:51] transforming power to bring you out of
[1:06:53] this deformity of religion that you're
[1:06:55] in and this deformity chaos that were in
[1:06:58] God has sent his transforming power his
[1:07:00] word vindicated proven to bring you out
[1:07:03] of this religious deformity of ignorance
[1:07:05] that you're walking in naked blind
[1:07:07] missable don't know it think of it
[1:07:08] friends you know God sent his
[1:07:10] transforming power to fulfill his word
[1:07:12] and he changed the whole body of Sarah
[1:07:15] and Abraham transformed an old man a
[1:07:17] tall woman because he promised here
[1:07:18] doing Alleluia now it says in
[1:07:23] Revelations 3 and 20 If any man hear my
[1:07:25] voice and open the door I will come in
[1:07:27] to him and he'll sup with me and I with
[1:07:29] him I mean that is the same voice as
[1:07:31] revelations 10 7 the 7th church age
[1:07:34] messenger now when God speaks there is
[1:07:37] transforming power in his word right
[1:07:39] when he spoke in Genesis 1 a many sand
[1:07:43] and he brooded over the earth the earth
[1:07:45] was transformed from a chaos that it was
[1:07:47] in into an Eden right when God spoke
[1:07:50] away from chaos and darkness and to an
[1:07:52] Eden amen and then now when he spoke
[1:07:56] through Moses Amen down into Egypt it
[1:07:58] transformed Israel from a bunch of
[1:08:01] slaves to a free people living in their
[1:08:03] own lands but the true believer in
[1:08:06] Israel was transformed I mean Caleb went
[1:08:09] from a slave he heard the voice of God
[1:08:11] it transformed him from a slave to the
[1:08:14] chasing a mountain and the promised land
[1:08:16] to possessing his inheritance rights he
[1:08:18] was transformed I mean he may have
[1:08:20] looked the same on the outside but the
[1:08:22] inside was very different hallelujah the
[1:08:26] Lord Jesus when he was here in the days
[1:08:28] of his flesh amen
[1:08:30] well actually let's go back a bit the
[1:08:33] Bible said out of Egypt I've called my
[1:08:35] son so Israel and and that's a that
[1:08:39] scripture has compound meeting one it
[1:08:41] speaks about Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:08:42] by Moses but it's also Jesus being
[1:08:45] called out of Egypt right so now when
[1:08:47] God spoke through Moses God was calling
[1:08:50] out his son out of Egypt so they went
[1:08:52] from slaves to sonship right they went
[1:08:55] from being a slave under Pharaoh to
[1:08:58] their position in the land right they
[1:09:00] were transformed I mean the Lord Jesus
[1:09:02] in the days of his flesh he called out
[1:09:04] of people amen and they were transformed
[1:09:08] they said under the spoken word for
[1:09:10] three and a half years and then now the
[1:09:12] word that they received the Spirit of
[1:09:14] God came into them day of Pentecost and
[1:09:16] they were transformed I mean Peter was
[1:09:18] transformed I mean from being afraid
[1:09:20] under a bit of pressure I mean to the to
[1:09:23] the boulders he had on the day of
[1:09:24] Pentecost preaching amen
[1:09:26] you know they were transformed from from
[1:09:28] a bunch of afraid people locked up in an
[1:09:30] upper room they'd boldness they went out
[1:09:32] on the street
[1:09:33] hallelujah they're transformed yes amen
[1:09:36] now the reason that they were
[1:09:39] transformed just like you take the earth
[1:09:41] why did not why did God not brood over
[1:09:43] the moon there's no life in the moon why
[1:09:46] did he not brood over Mars there's no
[1:09:48] life on Mars you could go through every
[1:09:50] planet and there's and there's a lot of
[1:09:52] planets apparently that look like they
[1:09:54] may have life but why didn't he brood
[1:09:55] over them they were seated in this earth
[1:09:57] that's why he brooded
[1:09:59] that's why his Trent that's why his word
[1:10:00] went forth over this earth with
[1:10:02] transforming power to bring forth an
[1:10:04] Eden because there was life and that
[1:10:06] life on this earth that had to be
[1:10:08] produced hallelujah and it's the same
[1:10:10] thing with you and I friends amen you've
[1:10:13] heard his word his word is transforming
[1:10:15] power and has transformed you I trusted
[1:10:18] has has transformed you you're not just
[1:10:21] looking and saying why are these people
[1:10:22] excited you know why they're excited
[1:10:24] because you
[1:10:25] experience the same thing you have
[1:10:26] experiences Redemption Alleluia amen
[1:10:34] that same God that spoken Eden has
[1:10:36] spoken through a prophet messenger in
[1:10:38] this day a man has brought a
[1:10:41] transforming power that has taken a
[1:10:43] people out of every kindred nation and
[1:10:45] tongue to produce the Bride of Christ
[1:10:47] for himself right and I said just like
[1:10:50] David and David before he was the ship
[1:10:52] it was a king right
[1:10:54] he was already king but it had to come
[1:10:55] to life that was laying dormant there he
[1:10:58] was he was there in Jesse's house just
[1:11:01] you know I don't know what he was like
[1:11:03] when he was young but there he was
[1:11:04] but then there must be a king it had to
[1:11:08] be anointed that seed and his life had
[1:11:10] to be anointed so God sent a vindicated
[1:11:13] prophet with a horn of the anointing oil
[1:11:16] any and you know why don't he anoint the
[1:11:19] other you know if he anointed a Bernard
[1:11:21] a bore the other sons a woman have
[1:11:23] brought for the king they may have felt
[1:11:26] a bit emotional they may have felt
[1:11:27] special
[1:11:28] there's no king in there it would never
[1:11:30] have produced a king but David is the
[1:11:33] king in there and Samuel was under the
[1:11:35] right leadership because he was going to
[1:11:37] anoint I've been a dam or the eldest one
[1:11:39] whatever his name was and God says no I
[1:11:41] don't look according to the outward
[1:11:43] appearance I look at the man's heart I
[1:11:46] look what's really in someone Oh
[1:11:47] helllooo yeah and then finally you know
[1:11:50] one sango's pass no it's not whom next
[1:11:53] one and maybe Jesse's thinking well
[1:11:54] surely this one and surely this one and
[1:11:57] surely this one and God saying Samuel no
[1:11:59] no no no I've lost count how many knows
[1:12:03] I've said but then they're all gone
[1:12:05] through anyway and then Samuels like
[1:12:08] well do you have another one
[1:12:10] Jesse's like I actually do why wasn't he
[1:12:13] called he wasn't considered how lujah
[1:12:17] hallelujah no I would have considered
[1:12:20] you amen the woman at the well you think
[1:12:23] she would be there as a fulfillment of
[1:12:24] our God saying I'll pour my spirit out
[1:12:26] upon all flesh now no one would think
[1:12:28] she would equate to that Peter James and
[1:12:30] John illiterate fisherman ignorant fish
[1:12:33] they are part of that prophecy but but
[1:12:35] the Karem I would say would be the high
[1:12:37] priest it'd be these scribes would be
[1:12:38] these people look they should fulfill it
[1:12:40] no not considered not considered and
[1:12:43] here you are I don't think the world
[1:12:44] would consider us to be anything but
[1:12:46] what does God consider us to be what
[1:12:48] does God say we are that's the important
[1:12:50] thing
[1:12:51] hallelujah what does God say and then
[1:12:53] finally David's called and God says this
[1:12:55] is him this is him and he kneels down
[1:12:58] the anointing oil a proper vindicated
[1:13:00] proven prophet anoint anoint Sassie and
[1:13:04] the Spirit of God the Bible says is
[1:13:06] worth it from that day forward what
[1:13:08] happens now that kingship begins to grow
[1:13:09] their kingship and is the rock and then
[1:13:11] here you are God sent a message you know
[1:13:14] what God sent a message it's an anointed
[1:13:16] the words I speak to their spur in their
[1:13:19] life right there anointed word and God
[1:13:21] release an anointed word cuz he knew
[1:13:23] that that fall into URIs and they've got
[1:13:25] from just your ease into your soul and a
[1:13:27] bring for the sea and then they would
[1:13:29] bring you bring a transforming pound
[1:13:31] here live hallelujah hey the whole
[1:13:34] anointing has been poured out on the
[1:13:35] side pour it all out not just a little
[1:13:38] bit pour the whole thing out hallelujah
[1:13:40] and it wasn't a vial like he pointed
[1:13:42] stallworth a vial denotes a judgment oh
[1:13:46] yeah he took the Horn of anointing oil
[1:13:48] poured it out hallelujah and that horn
[1:13:52] is a ram's horn
[1:13:54] Allu yeah and what happened now a
[1:13:57] transforming power came into David's
[1:13:59] life then he was really king of a sheep
[1:14:01] you know we start off small you know God
[1:14:04] is working in every situation you may
[1:14:07] just have I don't know what you do it
[1:14:09] doesn't you know it doesn't matter where
[1:14:10] you are God's working God's training you
[1:14:12] that's training you you may just have a
[1:14:15] child a little family or start a
[1:14:16] business or start a job start a career
[1:14:18] you may be learning you may be at school
[1:14:20] doesn't matter we were God is
[1:14:22] transforming you polio God had him as a
[1:14:25] shepherd because he's saying now this is
[1:14:27] how cheaper and then he and then David
[1:14:30] as the revelation the Lord is my
[1:14:32] shepherd
[1:14:32] I'm a sheep too he saw sheep behavior
[1:14:36] and people right so he could apply that
[1:14:38] training to when he was really cool
[1:14:41] Allu yeah our God is wonderful
[1:14:45] amen so he begun to go through a
[1:14:47] transformation now we're gonna go back
[1:14:51] to opening text a bit he says and that
[1:14:55] he died for all that we which live
[1:14:58] should not henceforth live unto
[1:15:01] ourselves but I'm the him which died for
[1:15:03] them and rose again wherefore henceforth
[1:15:05] henceforth means now hereafter right now
[1:15:08] now from here no we no man after the
[1:15:11] flesh yea though we have known Christ
[1:15:13] after the flesh yet now henceforth know
[1:15:16] we him no more so you say well that's a
[1:15:19] bit of an unusual think now is that what
[1:15:21] Paul is saying is you've known him as
[1:15:23] the man from Galilee right there are
[1:15:25] people that Paul was writing to we're
[1:15:27] living witnesses I was there swimming on
[1:15:29] the Mount I was there when he comes to
[1:15:31] Isaac but Jesus wasn't he had manifested
[1:15:34] himself as the men of Galilee he had
[1:15:37] purchased our Redemption Amen he had
[1:15:39] loosed his blood upon the earth to
[1:15:41] redeem of people his spirit had been
[1:15:42] loosed upon the earth but now he's not
[1:15:44] known that way anymore
[1:15:45] Rochus he's the great I am yeah he's the
[1:15:48] great item he's not that I was even
[1:15:50] though we believe what he did in history
[1:15:52] but you got to believe the present truth
[1:15:53] because the present truth ties you back
[1:15:56] into what he did in history right so now
[1:15:58] well how do we know him now because you
[1:16:01] say well I'm looking for Jesus to return
[1:16:03] with now scarred hands the next time we
[1:16:05] see is corporal bodies where we meet him
[1:16:07] in the air
[1:16:08] that's the promise of the meeting when
[1:16:10] we will see that body right we'll see
[1:16:12] him in his flesh in the meeting in the
[1:16:13] air I'm looking forward to that meeting
[1:16:17] hallelujah are you I'm looking forward
[1:16:19] to see him in there oh there's my lovely
[1:16:21] Lord Jesus probably hallelujah I've been
[1:16:23] waiting for this moment how look at me
[1:16:25] look forward to this moment I'm in the
[1:16:27] same screwed that's here among us we'll
[1:16:28] take us up hallelujah take us up amen so
[1:16:32] now but how do we know him now we know
[1:16:35] him by his word when it's manifested
[1:16:39] that's how we know him when God
[1:16:41] manifests his word that's him right
[1:16:44] brother Brad said and I've I've heard of
[1:16:46] leaving but now I see thee it's when you
[1:16:48] when you see God manifested you see him
[1:16:50] right where whatever God is veiled
[1:16:53] behind that
[1:16:54] you seeing godlike jobs saw him in a
[1:16:56] whirlwind right God is not the woman but
[1:16:59] he has veiled in the whirlwind right so
[1:17:01] when God manifests his word that's when
[1:17:05] we see him and that's how we know him by
[1:17:07] his word being manifested right so you
[1:17:11] say well what does this got to do with
[1:17:13] you say well how's this so Paul said
[1:17:16] that Jesus when when he was writing his
[1:17:19] epistles he said in one place that Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ has preached unto you
[1:17:22] right so they knew him by the preaching
[1:17:24] of the word amen
[1:17:27] right and so that and it wasn't just
[1:17:32] word only but God came and manifested
[1:17:35] proved that this was him
[1:17:37] right so now this message this message
[1:17:39] is God manifested right this is Jesus
[1:17:42] Christ making himself known right so we
[1:17:45] know him right we don't know him after
[1:17:48] the flesh right because we went back
[1:17:50] there we're here in this day we know him
[1:17:53] by his word being manifested everyone
[1:17:57] Allu you right that's how we know him
[1:17:59] and that's how we should also know one
[1:18:01] another as we shouldn't be caught up and
[1:18:04] because we're always going to have this
[1:18:05] thing right this thing disappoints not
[1:18:08] only ourselves but each other
[1:18:09] right well you know we you know we rub
[1:18:12] and we are why'd they say this why they
[1:18:14] mean listen do they mean listen you know
[1:18:15] how so you know and we get because it's
[1:18:17] it's this progress is this sticky nature
[1:18:20] and we'll always have this thing until
[1:18:22] it's change right but we should be able
[1:18:24] to look beyond this look beyond the veil
[1:18:27] and say this part of God this part of
[1:18:29] God this part of God this part of God
[1:18:31] this part of God
[1:18:32] what there's part of the bride they're
[1:18:33] all part of the bride right we should
[1:18:35] rather look beyond this veil and so I
[1:18:38] can see God I mean that's why I said in
[1:18:41] first Corinthians 11 they weren't
[1:18:42] discerning the Lord's body where God was
[1:18:45] where God is so now these these people
[1:18:51] that gave themselves to David they
[1:18:54] weren't looking just at a man they are
[1:18:56] looking at prophecy being fulfilled
[1:18:58] they're looking at a vindication prophet
[1:19:02] anointing a vessel saying you will
[1:19:04] become king you are king of Israel
[1:19:06] they're looking at that
[1:19:07] now looking at that above all other
[1:19:09] things right they weren't looking at
[1:19:12] David stature or maybe how he carried
[1:19:15] himself they knew he was coming into
[1:19:17] power they knew he was going to become
[1:19:19] King and that's why they gathered
[1:19:21] themselves to him right they knew his
[1:19:24] coming into power now we know David as I
[1:19:29] said David was actually prophesied to
[1:19:31] come since in Genesis 49 and 10 the
[1:19:34] scepter shall not depart from Judah nor
[1:19:36] a lawgiver from between his feet until
[1:19:38] Shiloh shiloh come and unto him shall
[1:19:41] the gathering of his people be Shiloh is
[1:19:43] an attribute of the Messiah King when
[1:19:45] Messiah comes I mean so he's saying that
[1:19:47] the scepter shall not depart from Judah
[1:19:49] there shall be a king a kingship will
[1:19:51] continue through Judah even and even in
[1:19:53] the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 17 there's
[1:19:56] laws of what Kings should and shouldn't
[1:19:57] do I mean so they knew Moses was telling
[1:20:00] the people well God was speaking through
[1:20:02] Moses you're gonna have a king right you
[1:20:04] are going to have a king he says and
[1:20:06] I'll just read two verses Deuteronomy 17
[1:20:08] 14 and 15 we're now are coming to the
[1:20:10] land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
[1:20:12] and shall possess it and shall dwell
[1:20:13] therein and shall say I will see it a
[1:20:16] king over me like as all the nations
[1:20:18] that are round about me thou shall in
[1:20:20] any way set him king over thee whom the
[1:20:23] Lord thy God shall choose one from among
[1:20:26] thy brethren shall set king over thee
[1:20:28] thou mayst not set a stranger over the
[1:20:30] which is not thy brother oh oh yeah
[1:20:34] Saul was man's choice David was God's
[1:20:37] choice right so he was prophesied to
[1:20:40] come hallelujah now David as I said he
[1:20:43] was transformed from a shepherd boy into
[1:20:45] a king now all believers have in the
[1:20:50] inner man a dormant seed of
[1:20:52] predestination right it is sitting there
[1:20:55] but it takes a life to come - to - to
[1:20:59] bring it to life right just like a
[1:21:01] natural seed you can have it in a bag on
[1:21:03] the shelf or you can sit there but when
[1:21:05] you put it in the right soil you put
[1:21:07] give the right water the right sunlight
[1:21:09] whatever life comes out the life that's
[1:21:11] in it comes forth it goes through a
[1:21:13] transformation now as I said the bride
[1:21:19] is also prophesied through the Bible
[1:21:21] just like david was prophesied became
[1:21:23] the bride is all through the bible so
[1:21:26] many prophecies are pointing to you
[1:21:28] pointing to your day hallelujah and she
[1:21:32] is also going through a transformation
[1:21:34] now a person you say naturally also a
[1:21:37] person goes through a transformation
[1:21:39] right you take even a little baby and
[1:21:42] there must be an adult right you take
[1:21:45] you take you you know yo someone can be
[1:21:47] just 2 or 3 cells and a mother's womb
[1:21:49] and there mister be an adult right in
[1:21:51] the muster be fully functional as an
[1:21:53] adult but they had to go through a
[1:21:54] transformation but the life that's in
[1:21:56] them their DNA has to be expressed and
[1:21:58] it makes cells and grows and grows and
[1:21:59] grows and then they're born then
[1:22:01] eventually you know they get bigger and
[1:22:02] they can begin to you know when they
[1:22:05] first start off in life they they get
[1:22:07] afraid with that you know they scratch
[1:22:08] themselves they get scared they don't
[1:22:10] even realize these things are attached
[1:22:12] right but then it comes to the process
[1:22:15] of time right and it growth and a
[1:22:17] maturity then these things become very
[1:22:20] useful now I was thinking of a you know
[1:22:24] you take a brain surgeon and I'll say
[1:22:25] we'll say brother and Nene very
[1:22:26] specialized person or a very specialized
[1:22:28] job now those hands that they start with
[1:22:31] before they go on to training know you
[1:22:34] take a brain surgeon someone who says I
[1:22:36] want to be a brain surgeon but never
[1:22:37] been spent a day in school in their life
[1:22:39] would you trust them taking your skull
[1:22:41] off and rearranging things but then in
[1:22:46] the process of time with the right
[1:22:48] teaching the right training those same
[1:22:52] hands that you would never trust you
[1:22:54] give your life to right because that
[1:22:57] person has gone through a transformation
[1:22:59] right they've gone through a
[1:23:01] transformation but it all begins now
[1:23:04] it all begins with ambition you know
[1:23:08] what do you want to be when you grow up
[1:23:09] I'm still working on that one but some
[1:23:12] people from very young age I want to be
[1:23:14] this I want to be this and they just go
[1:23:15] become it right God put an ambition in
[1:23:18] you a deep calling to the deep right but
[1:23:24] so it begins with that but then you got
[1:23:26] to have the right text books right if a
[1:23:30] surgeon is learning from medical
[1:23:32] literature from a hundred years ago
[1:23:34] same procedures now they don't do back
[1:23:36] then because it's been refined right so
[1:23:39] you'd have the right textbooks and they
[1:23:42] have to become open right and in order
[1:23:45] for it really to become open you've got
[1:23:47] to have the right teachers I mean you
[1:23:50] gotta have the right teachers and then
[1:23:52] that that is written becomes manifested
[1:23:55] in the student so what's in the textbook
[1:23:57] as just words on paper becomes flesh I
[1:24:01] mean it puts on flesh right and then
[1:24:04] that produces the transformation now
[1:24:07] it's exactly the same thing right the
[1:24:10] word when the wood comes open to you I
[1:24:13] mean the word becomes open to the bride
[1:24:16] by the voice of the seventh angel amen
[1:24:19] and the same spirit that was upon him to
[1:24:21] preach the mysteries of the of the
[1:24:23] gospel this two to finish up the mystery
[1:24:26] of God amen comes upon you right and he
[1:24:31] that is anointed to preach the contents
[1:24:33] of the open book
[1:24:34] amen then that same spirit comes upon
[1:24:37] you and it quickens that word that you
[1:24:39] hear I mean and that the the the title
[1:24:43] deed everything that's everything that
[1:24:44] Adam lost becomes material in your life
[1:24:47] everything Adam lost the bride has been
[1:24:49] restored back to hey you following what
[1:24:52] I'm saying because it's season you know
[1:24:55] we can go to we can go to Isaiah 29 he
[1:24:59] says stay yourselves and wonder this is
[1:25:01] Isaiah 29 9 to 14 stay yourselves and
[1:25:06] wonder cry ye out and cry yet drunken
[1:25:09] but not with wine they stagger but not
[1:25:11] with strong drink for the Lord hath
[1:25:13] poured out upon you the spirit of deep
[1:25:15] sleep and it's closed your eyes the
[1:25:17] prophets and your rulers the seers had
[1:25:19] he covered now we're coming to a stage
[1:25:21] where Israel's eyes are coming open and
[1:25:24] as their eyes are coming open the gentle
[1:25:27] eyes are being blinded just like it was
[1:25:29] in the beginning when the Gospels first
[1:25:31] went out the Jews eyes were being
[1:25:33] blinded and the gentle eyes were coming
[1:25:35] open right and the vision but we're not
[1:25:38] anointed with this anointing right the
[1:25:40] bride is not anointed with a anointing a
[1:25:43] spirit of deep sleep and slumber and our
[1:25:45] eyes are closed that's not you know this
[1:25:47] Bible is
[1:25:47] not close to us it's not sealed up it's
[1:25:50] been opened up I mean in the vision of
[1:25:53] all of this become unto you as a book
[1:25:55] and the vision of all this became unto
[1:25:58] you as a book I mean as the words of a
[1:26:01] book that is sealed which mean deliver
[1:26:03] one that is learned saying read this I
[1:26:05] pray thee saith I cannot for it sealed
[1:26:07] and the book is delivered to him that
[1:26:09] has not learned saying read this I pray
[1:26:11] then he saith I'm not learned wherefore
[1:26:13] the Lord said for as much as this people
[1:26:15] draw near me with their mouths and with
[1:26:18] their lips too they honor me but have
[1:26:19] removed their heart far from me I'm glad
[1:26:22] we are not that way I mean that's why
[1:26:24] it's got to be more than lip service
[1:26:25] your life will prove what your what's in
[1:26:29] your heart I'm it's just like people say
[1:26:31] it doesn't matter how we dress though
[1:26:32] how you dress as a manifestation of
[1:26:34] what's in you right legion was naked
[1:26:39] insane demon-possessed in the tombs what
[1:26:42] he was wearing or not wearing was a
[1:26:45] manifestation of the Spirit in him and
[1:26:47] then when that spirit was driven out of
[1:26:49] him he has found closed in his right
[1:26:52] mind at the feet of Jesus therefore amen
[1:26:59] and their lips say honor me and have
[1:27:01] removed their heart far from me and
[1:27:03] their fear towards me as taught by the
[1:27:05] precept of men therefore behold I'll
[1:27:07] proceed to do a wondrous myrrh work
[1:27:09] among this people such a marvelous work
[1:27:12] and a wonder for the wisdom of their
[1:27:13] wise men shall perish and the
[1:27:15] understanding of the prudent men shall
[1:27:18] be hid as how does it become sealed but
[1:27:22] now for the bride that is not the case
[1:27:25] the word has come oh you know this the
[1:27:29] Bible has to become a new book to you
[1:27:31] rights become more than just stories in
[1:27:34] history and and think it's going to
[1:27:36] become a Living Word right it's been it
[1:27:38] has to become a love leader
[1:27:40] all right it's going to become a love
[1:27:42] leader where you're in relationship with
[1:27:43] the one who wrote it
[1:27:45] amen and so now as the book has come
[1:27:48] open now in the same anointing that was
[1:27:50] on the seventh angel which is the mighty
[1:27:52] angel himself Christ anoints you and
[1:27:55] then it manifests everything that was
[1:27:58] preached becomes living in you
[1:27:59] winner-winner pertains to the bride
[1:28:02] hallelujah and you are built so the word
[1:28:05] then puts on flesh and builds you into
[1:28:08] the living image of the Lord Jesus amen
[1:28:11] that's why what is the message this is
[1:28:14] the message it's Jesus Christ in a
[1:28:17] people amen it's Christ in you the hope
[1:28:20] of glory and then how that life
[1:28:22] manifests out of a people hallelujah now
[1:28:28] Paul the Apostle Paul says in Hebrews
[1:28:32] six and one I'm just gonna hope you
[1:28:34] don't mind the when the reader was
[1:28:36] laying out a few more things therefore
[1:28:37] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:28:39] of Christ yes let us go unto perfection
[1:28:42] not laying in the foundation of
[1:28:44] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:28:45] towards God of the doctrines of baptisms
[1:28:48] and of laying out of hands of the
[1:28:49] resurrection of the Dead and of eternal
[1:28:51] judgment and this we do if God permit
[1:28:55] now he's not saying forsake the
[1:28:57] principles of the doctrine he's not
[1:28:59] saying throw it away he's saying let's
[1:29:01] go on let's go from here and it's built
[1:29:04] right that's what he saying he's not
[1:29:06] saying forsake it I mean we need the
[1:29:09] principles of doctrine of Christ we
[1:29:10] saying let's go on from here right and
[1:29:13] that's why we've got to go on from most
[1:29:15] things what is the profit what does God
[1:29:17] said in this day right we should look
[1:29:19] into it we should listen to it I mean
[1:29:22] where if God has added his voice upon
[1:29:24] the earth to make you into his very
[1:29:25] image I would I would beli that very
[1:29:27] highly I mean this is in Hebrews five
[1:29:31] and thirteen he says for everyone that
[1:29:33] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:29:35] righteousness for he is a babe but
[1:29:37] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[1:29:39] of full age even those who by reason of
[1:29:42] use have their senses exercised to
[1:29:44] discern both good and evil I mean so we
[1:29:48] want to be I believe we're full age
[1:29:51] right I believe I believe in for now
[1:29:53] young people can take the fullness of
[1:29:54] the of the word of who Jesus is right
[1:29:57] we don't just eat sure they'll be
[1:29:59] milking every service but we should have
[1:30:00] the meat too I like a fool you know it's
[1:30:04] like of people you know they were well I
[1:30:06] didn't this is was there are people at
[1:30:09] university flatting and all they lived
[1:30:12] on was was rice and potatoes cuz it's
[1:30:15] cheap
[1:30:15] they got scurvy they got scurvy why
[1:30:20] because they've never balance diet right
[1:30:23] they'll come a time a baby lives on milk
[1:30:26] but then it comes at humber a baby needs
[1:30:28] more than milk right it's it's its life
[1:30:31] its body is calling for more than milk I
[1:30:34] need more than and it's the same thing
[1:30:37] with us friends we can't just live on
[1:30:38] rice and potatoes
[1:30:39] we can't just live on the milk of the
[1:30:41] word we need the we need the full meat I
[1:30:43] mean we need the full course we need all
[1:30:46] the word hallelujah I say we shouldn't
[1:30:51] be afraid to look at anything or preach
[1:30:52] from anywhere in the message Amen so but
[1:30:59] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[1:31:01] full age even those who by reason of use
[1:31:04] so those who have the strong meat so by
[1:31:07] the reason of youth they have their
[1:31:08] senses exercised to discern both good
[1:31:10] and evil amen you eat a full course meal
[1:31:13] you'll be able to zoom between good and
[1:31:15] evil right oh yeah now I want to go back
[1:31:21] to David's mighty men as I as I've said
[1:31:23] they did not start off if one's read the
[1:31:27] story right one killed jump into a but
[1:31:30] you know as a lineman and killed the
[1:31:31] lion one killed a few hundred men and
[1:31:33] you know they did exploits they did
[1:31:35] great exploits and it wasn't Hollywood
[1:31:37] it's not a choreographed battle sync I
[1:31:39] mean they were just they just went in
[1:31:41] there and they you know like Samson with
[1:31:43] the jawbone oh but the reason was that's
[1:31:47] why they look beyond David yesterday
[1:31:50] they saw this man is going to become
[1:31:52] king the the prophecy that was placed on
[1:31:56] his life he will become king it doesn't
[1:31:58] matter how dark it looks it doesn't
[1:32:00] matter how much on the runway oh it
[1:32:01] doesn't matter how bad things may be he
[1:32:03] is going to become king
[1:32:04] knew he was coming into power right and
[1:32:07] that same anointing that was upon David
[1:32:09] look at David he's a shepherd boy but it
[1:32:11] wants to be king he comes he comes
[1:32:12] aligning into his Dominion well you know
[1:32:16] what's gonna happen David one lion zero
[1:32:19] right and he comes a beer he's King he's
[1:32:23] still king of the Sheep king of the
[1:32:25] Sheep he comes a beer a bigger enemy you
[1:32:28] know what's going to happen like David
[1:32:31] to Lyman br0
[1:32:33] right he comes Goliath do you know where
[1:32:38] they fight they're in Judah you know
[1:32:40] their battles and Judah who's David's
[1:32:43] from Judah it comes a man living in his
[1:32:46] inheritance he's living in us as
[1:32:48] inheritance he's anointed me to become
[1:32:50] king of this land and he comes an
[1:32:52] uncircumcised Philistine saying bring me
[1:32:55] a man and that both fell on the wrong
[1:32:58] mans he is that day hallelujah and now
[1:33:01] they square off
[1:33:04] Goliath belittles David what am i dog
[1:33:07] you can't chase me with stones and
[1:33:09] sticks and whatever more I'll feed you
[1:33:11] to the birds and David said I've come
[1:33:14] you've come with your spear and whatever
[1:33:16] you have I come name a little god of
[1:33:18] hosts of Israel and he's staying there
[1:33:20] and hearth in his inheritance and we
[1:33:22] know what's going to happen
[1:33:23] David three the devil 0 listen this is
[1:33:31] our inheritance right this word that's
[1:33:34] become open as our inheritance oh I mean
[1:33:36] everything in Christ belongs to you
[1:33:38] everything that's why the message opens
[1:33:41] this I mean that you'll see this is who
[1:33:43] this who the Lord is he's the Lord God
[1:33:45] Almighty he's not a third person not a
[1:33:47] second person he's the Lord God Almighty
[1:33:49] and then he sees that this is what the
[1:33:51] bride is your joint is with me right
[1:33:54] what I am you become I mean so I conquer
[1:33:57] death the last I mean at the sound of
[1:34:00] the last Trump death shall be swallowed
[1:34:02] up in victory I mean so even death will
[1:34:04] be swallowed up in victory hallelujah as
[1:34:06] he conquered death to our people will
[1:34:08] conquer death as well I mean that's why
[1:34:10] all sickness must give way you know the
[1:34:13] name of Jesus Christ is the true where
[1:34:15] the true interpretation of the word is
[1:34:17] manifest
[1:34:17] that that is the manifestation of the
[1:34:19] name of Jesus holy that's why now here
[1:34:22] you are it's more than just saying Jesus
[1:34:24] Jesus Jesus multitude say the name
[1:34:26] there's no life backing up there what
[1:34:29] they say right so where the true word is
[1:34:32] that's where Jesus is that's why we
[1:34:36] gather of them because we gather around
[1:34:37] with the true word is he is the word
[1:34:39] he's a person holy that's why gates of
[1:34:42] hell give way to the name of Jesus
[1:34:43] Christ give way to the living
[1:34:45] manifestation of the name of Jesus
[1:34:47] Christ hallelujah
[1:34:50] David walking in his inheritance every
[1:34:52] enemy must go walking just walk in the
[1:34:55] word it's your inheritance
[1:34:57] doesn't matter what enemy comes along
[1:34:59] and the battle may be sure that may be
[1:35:01] long who's gonna win you one devil zero
[1:35:05] I've seen the scoreboard
[1:35:07] have you read the scoreboard have you
[1:35:10] read the final school you say you say
[1:35:12] this thing's rigged of course it's
[1:35:14] rigged
[1:35:15] God's pre dismay at the end hallelujah
[1:35:18] this is rigged we don't need to worry
[1:35:22] you will have the victory you will have
[1:35:25] the victory it doesn't matter the Bride
[1:35:28] of Christ is not does not come sick in
[1:35:31] place to the devil's argument right just
[1:35:36] like I read a few Sundays ago in John 8
[1:35:37] Jesus is speaking and the scribes and
[1:35:39] Pharisees say your record is not true
[1:35:41] and Jesus said in your law to a
[1:35:44] witnesses he says I say something and
[1:35:46] the father comes in and says it so jesus
[1:35:50] said something in Jesus not me to do it
[1:35:52] the work sister it's the father in me he
[1:35:54] doeth the works so jesus said something
[1:35:56] I think God came in the spirit of the
[1:35:58] father came and manifested just like the
[1:36:01] crippled man Jesus said yo yo yo yos
[1:36:04] friends take the roof off lower him down
[1:36:08] Jesus says license be forgiven thee and
[1:36:13] then and then they're all criticizing
[1:36:15] him how dare he say that it easier for
[1:36:18] me to say that but you all know I said
[1:36:21] take up your bed and walk as a
[1:36:24] manifestation as a proof that is since
[1:36:26] were
[1:36:27] forgiving right so we'll just him making
[1:36:29] an idle boast God came supernatural
[1:36:32] power of God came in to prove what he
[1:36:34] was saved hallelujah the Apostle Paul
[1:36:37] said I don't come with word only they
[1:36:40] you add that your confidence would be in
[1:36:42] man's wisdom our confidence is not in
[1:36:44] man's wisdom but spare demonstration of
[1:36:46] the Holy Ghost I mean that God says this
[1:36:48] is my word this is me this is me this is
[1:36:51] me hallelujah shouldn't we have
[1:36:53] confidence in that if God you know
[1:36:56] because when God takes a witness stage
[1:36:58] he's listened to the trial messages you
[1:37:02] should go listen to him go listen to the
[1:37:03] one in 1964 brother baron speaks about
[1:37:06] the bridge he speaks about the ohio
[1:37:08] river so you've had different
[1:37:10] testimonies then God comes in against
[1:37:14] the call people out God is saying I am
[1:37:17] happy to be identified with this man's
[1:37:19] witness you say well I don't know about
[1:37:23] it well God said God said I'm gonna God
[1:37:26] said I agree with what he said I'm
[1:37:28] testifying on his behalf now what do you
[1:37:32] do with it what are you doing this what
[1:37:34] do you do with that yeah think about it
[1:37:36] if God said this is me well that's him
[1:37:40] Moses comes down into Egypt let my
[1:37:44] people go
[1:37:45] Pharisees who who's gonna let him go
[1:37:48] bassy is God now you come on you just do
[1:37:55] what I told you do throw the stuff down
[1:37:56] have Aaron throw the stuff down turn the
[1:37:58] water into blood whatever more God
[1:38:01] stepped in and said because when Moses
[1:38:03] said let my people go they were God's
[1:38:05] people God was speaking through Moses
[1:38:07] doesn't matter what fair I was doing God
[1:38:10] came and said no this is me that's the
[1:38:14] most important thing
[1:38:16] I mean that's the most important thing
[1:38:17] when God says this is me that's why it
[1:38:23] goes beyond debate
[1:38:24] I mean God vindicates his word
[1:38:27] that's if he doesn't then all we have
[1:38:30] his argument and how did the head of the
[1:38:33] church start silver and gold have our
[1:38:35] numbers such as I had give ID what they
[1:38:38] what they said they received they proved
[1:38:41] it right there on the day of Pentecost
[1:38:43] now they didn't just sit around for ten
[1:38:45] days and say well let's act excited and
[1:38:49] jump out and say this is that no God
[1:38:52] came down and God said this is that and
[1:38:55] then it was proven it was that and then
[1:38:57] and then God came in behind it uh you
[1:38:59] know the your the scribes and Pharisees
[1:39:02] put pressure on don't preach in his name
[1:39:03] anymore don't do these things it's now
[1:39:06] an argument this is intimidation the
[1:39:08] devil intimidates you bullies don't do
[1:39:11] this anymore
[1:39:12] don't believe these things there's
[1:39:13] nothing to it and you can actually they
[1:39:15] could have stood there and said to yo
[1:39:17] mister car versus mr. high priest what
[1:39:20] do you have to give me what do you have
[1:39:23] well we have tradition what is your
[1:39:25] tradition do you're stuck here under the
[1:39:27] Dominion of the Romans that you want to
[1:39:29] overthrow you don't have your land you
[1:39:31] just have your dead traditions of man
[1:39:33] you look at what people are selling and
[1:39:37] then so God came in and backed up the
[1:39:39] disciples right Paul goes into a place
[1:39:43] God comes in behind and confirms what he
[1:39:46] says that's how you know he's true yeah
[1:39:48] and if the gospel started their way or
[1:39:51] tool in that way how lujah they david's
[1:40:00] mighty men the same anointing that was
[1:40:03] on david came upon them right they knew
[1:40:07] he was coming into power their brother
[1:40:10] Brahim sees us in marriage and divorce
[1:40:12] oh well I just say this first
[1:40:15] I trust you see this anointed word that
[1:40:17] we've received which is Jesus you know
[1:40:19] one day he'll sit on the throne of David
[1:40:21] in the Millennium right I trusted
[1:40:24] something and you saying I know he's get
[1:40:25] Lord I know you're coming into power I
[1:40:27] know you'll be there in the Millennium
[1:40:29] doesn't matter what goes on around among
[1:40:31] us I know you may be rejected you may be
[1:40:34] despised you may be hated you may be
[1:40:37] ridiculed I know you're coming into
[1:40:38] power he says now we find today that the
[1:40:45] church character Satan and his group
[1:40:47] look after look after big beautiful
[1:40:50] churches beautiful things that's what
[1:40:52] the world looks at today oh it's the
[1:40:54] past of the great so and so time so and
[1:40:57] so so priestly godly walking up these
[1:40:59] fine big robes things like that they
[1:41:01] call that beauty but the real saints of
[1:41:04] God looked for the character of the
[1:41:05] vindicated word that's what the Saints
[1:41:08] did in that day when they seen Jesus he
[1:41:11] wasn't nothing to look at but they
[1:41:12] seemed god was in him they think God was
[1:41:15] with them that's what that's how those
[1:41:18] Joe had those characters with David a
[1:41:21] little old fellow they seen they seen
[1:41:24] the man was in him they seen that God
[1:41:27] was in him they knowed he was coming
[1:41:29] into power some day one slew other five
[1:41:33] brothers of glass' single-handed one
[1:41:34] killed 300 men and some women were
[1:41:36] picking up beans for dinner an army had
[1:41:38] gone away he took up a spear killed 300
[1:41:40] men Philistines he said character way
[1:41:42] they stayed right by David they know the
[1:41:45] anointing was upon him they knowed he
[1:41:47] was coming into power he says a pure
[1:41:49] picture of the church today that will
[1:41:52] stand by the word we know it's going to
[1:41:55] be made vindicated we know it's coming
[1:41:57] into power someday he says although he
[1:41:59] was a fugitive from the rest of the
[1:42:01] nations but they knowed he was coming
[1:42:03] into power we know he's coming into
[1:42:05] power too so we take that word and stand
[1:42:08] right there no matter what it costs if
[1:42:11] we have to cut Philistines or jump into
[1:42:13] a pit and kill a lion as wondered we go
[1:42:16] anyhow cause it's that's the way God
[1:42:19] designed it to be we look for character
[1:42:22] we look for the life of God being
[1:42:25] produced
[1:42:26] right and now the character of the word
[1:42:31] is what we look for and that's what
[1:42:34] we've seen right you take a true
[1:42:36] believer
[1:42:37] you see Jesus's character you see Jesus
[1:42:39] is nature why is that because they've
[1:42:42] seen a word is coming this day which is
[1:42:43] Jesus Christ and they know he's coming
[1:42:45] into power and anointing is come upon
[1:42:47] them because we're looking for we've
[1:42:49] seen his character hallelujah now now he
[1:42:59] see it's here in Ephesians 3:16 well
[1:43:03] I've just got 16 to 19 he says that he
[1:43:06] would grant you according to the riches
[1:43:07] of his glory to be strengthened with the
[1:43:09] might by his spirit in the inner man
[1:43:11] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:43:14] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:43:16] in love may be able to comprehend with
[1:43:19] All Saints what is the breadth and the
[1:43:21] length and the depth and the height and
[1:43:23] to know the love of God which passes
[1:43:25] knowledge that ye may be filled with all
[1:43:27] the fullness of God this is what there's
[1:43:30] what Paul was you know it was desiring
[1:43:33] God would grant us this right so in the
[1:43:35] inner man Christ would dwell in us
[1:43:37] hallelujah so now when God so there's as
[1:43:41] so as I see it as a natural person right
[1:43:44] our natural bodies we go from a little
[1:43:46] well to cells and we go into a
[1:43:47] fully-fledged at all right so we as
[1:43:50] spiritual people we go from a babe in
[1:43:53] Christ and we mature we grow right until
[1:43:57] we are transformed our inner man oh I'll
[1:44:00] just use my terms the inner man it comes
[1:44:03] into his image right so we go from a
[1:44:06] baby then we grow into a fool me fully
[1:44:08] mature image of Jesus Christ now brother
[1:44:13] BAM says this and you know in the
[1:44:15] communion message he says I was saying
[1:44:19] this taking for myself like you was
[1:44:21] going to say William Brennan well 40
[1:44:23] years ago william branham it isn't the
[1:44:25] same one tonight if somebody back there
[1:44:28] would say william branham he's a ranked
[1:44:29] rascal see because I was born of Charles
[1:44:32] and Ella Branham and innate and in their
[1:44:35] nature I was a sinner I come to the
[1:44:37] world a liar and all the habits of the
[1:44:39] world lay right in
[1:44:40] but down in there too was another nature
[1:44:43] presence he predestinated was in there
[1:44:45] by God and the same body see two natures
[1:44:48] in there
[1:44:49] well I only catered to one and as it
[1:44:52] grows I good as a baby Dada first thing
[1:44:55] you know I became a liar became
[1:44:57] everything else that's a sinner because
[1:45:00] I was raised up that way so he's
[1:45:02] catering to his first nature right but
[1:45:04] down in there was a little speck of life
[1:45:06] all the time I used to remember as a
[1:45:09] little boy he says I hope I'm not
[1:45:11] holding you too long but sitting out
[1:45:13] there on the creek bank and I'd sit
[1:45:14] there and look around at nighttime mom
[1:45:17] and pop they had gone on now to the
[1:45:19] arrest and them days they were sinners
[1:45:21] there was no Christianity in our home at
[1:45:22] all and oh my drinking parties and
[1:45:25] carrying on it made me sick I take my
[1:45:27] lantern of my dog and go through the
[1:45:29] woods stay all night and the wintertime
[1:45:31] I'd hunt till the party was over
[1:45:32] maybe daylight in the morning come home
[1:45:34] wouldn't be over I'd lay on the top of
[1:45:36] the shed and sleep waiting for daylight
[1:45:38] to break then I then I think of how that
[1:45:41] times then being out there in the summer
[1:45:45] time get my sticks and put put them down
[1:45:48] for a little wooden break a where a
[1:45:50] train laid there and having the pole
[1:45:52] sticking the water fishing my old
[1:45:53] dog laying there
[1:45:54] I'd say looking here you know last
[1:45:56] winter I camped right here one night I
[1:45:58] built a fire right here when I was
[1:46:00] waiting for my old dog here to tree and
[1:46:03] I had a fire here it was froze five
[1:46:05] inches deep in the ground but little
[1:46:08] flower where'd you come from see well
[1:46:10] where did you come from who come here
[1:46:14] and planted you and that hot house did
[1:46:17] they bring you out or where'd you come
[1:46:20] from see that little flower I'd say why
[1:46:21] it was froze and everything and I built
[1:46:23] a fire on top of here besides the
[1:46:25] freezing element there was the heat
[1:46:26] element laying here on the cold a big
[1:46:29] old log where I burned you and yet here
[1:46:31] you are you're alive where'd you come
[1:46:32] from what was it there was another
[1:46:35] william branham see a little spot of
[1:46:37] eternal life down there from the genes
[1:46:39] of God the Word of God that was planted
[1:46:42] in there
[1:46:42] each one of you can think of similar
[1:46:44] things see it was working then look up
[1:46:47] to the trees and I think leaf I seen you
[1:46:49] fall off last year and why are you back
[1:46:52] there again where'd you come from what
[1:46:54] what you hear see it was eternal life
[1:46:56] working in the body I mean when you
[1:46:58] begin to think about this more than this
[1:47:00] life and what happens next that's
[1:47:01] eternal life working I mean now then one
[1:47:04] day as I walked on that voice talking
[1:47:06] don't ever smoke drink and so forth and
[1:47:08] the young fellows and all got older seed
[1:47:11] there was something moving but yet all
[1:47:13] at once I looked up I said I'm not the
[1:47:15] son of charles nella Browne and there's
[1:47:16] something calling like my little eagle
[1:47:19] I'm not a chicken there's something up
[1:47:20] yonder somewhere our great Jehovah
[1:47:22] whoever you are open up I want to come
[1:47:24] home there's something in me calling
[1:47:26] then I was born again that little life
[1:47:28] was laying there the the life of water
[1:47:32] was poured upon it and it began to grow
[1:47:34] now that old life was forgiven put in
[1:47:37] God's see if God's forgetfulness never
[1:47:39] to be remembered against we no more see
[1:47:41] now we stand justified as though we'd
[1:47:44] never sinned in the presence of God
[1:47:47] Allu you I trust as the same with you
[1:47:51] Amen now we are being built we are going
[1:47:55] from glory to glory I trust you are I
[1:47:58] trust you look back and say what I was a
[1:48:00] year ago I'm not the same one I've been
[1:48:02] grind more into his image I see more of
[1:48:04] his character more of his life and me
[1:48:06] hallelujah now as I said David didn't
[1:48:11] start off as a ship I mean he didn't
[1:48:13] start off as a king he started off as a
[1:48:14] shepherd boy but because there was the
[1:48:17] life that that seed of a king in him he
[1:48:20] had to become that King I mean because
[1:48:22] he was anointed by the Prophet he walked
[1:48:24] according to that prophecy that's what
[1:48:26] we must do Allu you now I want to kind
[1:48:34] of see grab it into into something else
[1:48:38] now we David remember David went through
[1:48:44] a lot of hard times in his life and God
[1:48:47] had to had to do that because we needed
[1:48:50] the Book of Psalms right we needed the
[1:48:53] Book of Psalms who's been comforted by
[1:48:54] the Book of Psalms right he had to go
[1:48:57] through those tight places and those you
[1:48:59] know he had to cuz the Book of Psalms
[1:49:02] had to be expressed and many times we go
[1:49:05] through things in life it's actually for
[1:49:06] someone else
[1:49:08] well it is for us to cuz Davis character
[1:49:10] was developed right through the trial
[1:49:12] but he didn't know we would read those
[1:49:14] things you know he didn't say this is
[1:49:16] going to go into every language and
[1:49:18] whatever more and God's children down
[1:49:20] through the ages gonna read this and be
[1:49:21] confident he didn't realize right but he
[1:49:24] had to go through those things that the
[1:49:26] Book of Psalms would be written
[1:49:27] hallelujah that we could be beneficially
[1:49:30] you know you know God allows situations
[1:49:34] for his life to be expressed that's what
[1:49:37] the devil I don't underst
[1:49:38] he doesn't even understand himself you
[1:49:40] know if the devil just lifts us alone
[1:49:42] God wouldn't even be expressed you think
[1:49:46] about it if David was just left alone
[1:49:48] we'd never have the book of Psalms
[1:49:50] you know we'd never have it it would
[1:49:52] just been but you know the devil he all
[1:49:55] remember the devil's just at all he's
[1:49:57] just a tool in God's hand for your
[1:49:59] benefit right he has nothing over God
[1:50:02] he's God gives him boundaries he tries
[1:50:05] to push against like a being an
[1:50:06] invisible cube or whatever you want to
[1:50:08] call it but he can't go beyond it right
[1:50:10] and so now we we have to remember that
[1:50:15] everything is working for our good and
[1:50:18] it's working that Christ would be
[1:50:20] expressed not you be expressed Jesus
[1:50:23] Christ would be expressed out of your
[1:50:25] life right now here we are for all but
[1:50:30] see David David kept his focus I'm gonna
[1:50:33] be king right this is what he he knew
[1:50:37] what it was like
[1:50:38] maybe he'd been anointed with the world
[1:50:39] before I don't know but the Spirit of
[1:50:41] God was with him from that day forward
[1:50:42] that what made the event very special
[1:50:45] right that was really kept off the whole
[1:50:47] of it and he kept that before him Lord
[1:50:50] you've made me king and in your season I
[1:50:53] will become king I don't need to kill
[1:50:56] Saul I don't need to work out some deal
[1:50:57] to get rid of him and have a cool aroma
[1:50:59] died or God put him there God to remove
[1:51:01] him then old when I'm ready I'll be
[1:51:03] there so he had confidence now and the
[1:51:05] prophecy that had been spoken over him
[1:51:07] by vindicated prophet now we this this
[1:51:12] this message is a message of
[1:51:14] transformation right and the ultimate
[1:51:17] transformation is the change in the body
[1:51:19] right where where
[1:51:21] mortality is swallowed up in immortality
[1:51:24] right the last enemy the last Trump
[1:51:26] death is swallowed up in victory right
[1:51:29] so this is this is what this message is
[1:51:32] to do is to make us into the image of
[1:51:33] Jesus Christ the word right as is bright
[1:51:35] and then we take a body change then we
[1:51:38] go to streets ago okay we should keep
[1:51:41] that in front of us we should keep that
[1:51:43] real folk art yeah yeah I think we
[1:51:45] should keep that you know all the time
[1:51:47] Lord this is a rapture call I've heard
[1:51:51] the call something in me said yes and I
[1:51:53] just gave myself I just gave it all I
[1:51:56] just jumped you know you got to jump you
[1:51:59] can't just say well oh I'll have one
[1:52:01] foot here you know you can't have some
[1:52:03] safety line crawl out and when it gets
[1:52:05] bad I'll pull myself back in I mean
[1:52:08] you've got to you got to let go and let
[1:52:09] God
[1:52:10] you got a fully surrender what's going
[1:52:12] to happen he'll change you you got to
[1:52:15] really die before you can be born again
[1:52:17] right and so now he says here that this
[1:52:20] is all things for your sakes that the
[1:52:23] abundance abundant grace they mean
[1:52:26] through might through the Thanksgiving
[1:52:27] of many a rear bear a readout of the
[1:52:31] glory of God for which cause we faint
[1:52:33] not for the outward man perish yet the
[1:52:36] inward man is renewed day by day for our
[1:52:39] light affliction is but for a moment
[1:52:41] worketh for us a far more exceeding
[1:52:43] eternal weight of glory while we look
[1:52:46] not at the things which are seen David
[1:52:49] did look at the things that are seen he
[1:52:51] looked at the unseen he looked at the
[1:52:52] promise right but the things which are
[1:52:55] not seen so while we sorry while we look
[1:52:58] not of the things which are seen but
[1:52:59] things which are not seen for the things
[1:53:01] which are seen a temporal but the things
[1:53:04] which are not seen are eternal so he
[1:53:06] says the slider fly see that's just a
[1:53:08] light affliction here's the man who went
[1:53:10] through a lot of hardship right he says
[1:53:13] just a light affliction right but it has
[1:53:15] a far more eternal weight but it is just
[1:53:18] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[1:53:21] exceeding eternal weight of glory so
[1:53:22] it's working for you okay now I just
[1:53:26] want you to think about those the
[1:53:28] prophets of old you imagine you imagine
[1:53:33] receiving
[1:53:35] a prophecy but I just read Rome from
[1:53:37] from Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 I'll take you
[1:53:41] from the heathen and gather you out of
[1:53:43] all countries and I'll bring you into
[1:53:45] your own land then will I sprinkle clean
[1:53:47] water upon you you shall be clean from
[1:53:50] all your filthiness and from all your
[1:53:52] idols will I cleanse you and you heart
[1:53:54] also will I give you and a new spirit
[1:53:56] will I put within you and I'll take away
[1:53:59] the stony heart out of your flesh and
[1:54:01] I'll give you a heart of flesh and I
[1:54:03] will put my spirit within you and cause
[1:54:05] you to walk in my statutes and you shall
[1:54:08] keep my judgments and do them so here's
[1:54:12] here's Ezekiel he's living in Babylon
[1:54:14] and God speaks to him us he would no
[1:54:18] doubt begin to think Lord when is this
[1:54:19] going to happen and he would pray Lord I
[1:54:22] want to see this I want to see this
[1:54:24] happen
[1:54:25] I want to you know when are you gonna
[1:54:27] gather us into our own land and do this
[1:54:29] and and put your spirit within us that
[1:54:31] we would keep your statutes walking them
[1:54:33] and do them you know the prophets
[1:54:35] prophesied of the grace that should come
[1:54:37] unto us yes I'm in the salvation he says
[1:54:40] in 1st Peter 1 it says of which
[1:54:42] salvation the prophets have been quiet
[1:54:44] and searched diligently who prophesied
[1:54:46] of the grace that you come unto you
[1:54:48] right searching what or what manner of
[1:54:52] time the Spirit of Christ which is in
[1:54:54] them did signify when it testified
[1:54:55] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[1:54:58] the glory that should follow and to whom
[1:55:00] it was revealed that not answered
[1:55:02] themselves but unto us they'd administer
[1:55:04] the things which are now reported unto
[1:55:07] you by them that have preached the
[1:55:09] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
[1:55:10] down from heaven which things the angels
[1:55:13] desire to look into so the prophets when
[1:55:15] they're prophesied these things they
[1:55:17] were looking when is it going to happen
[1:55:18] it was a longing in them when's it going
[1:55:20] to happen
[1:55:21] David was a peculiar man as the heart
[1:55:24] panas for the water Brooks so my soul
[1:55:26] longs after thee I mean he had such a
[1:55:28] burden Lord I what I need more and we
[1:55:30] should ever longing right but he was
[1:55:32] living under the blood of bulls and
[1:55:33] goats there was not a blood there they
[1:55:36] could actually release the Spirit of God
[1:55:38] into him not just anointed but to be
[1:55:41] into him to satisfy his desire right
[1:55:44] because if the blood of bulls and goats
[1:55:46] did it why did Jesus need to die
[1:55:48] right so he was head of head along it as
[1:55:51] I as the hot pennant for the water book
[1:55:53] so my soul longs after thee oh you're my
[1:55:56] soul longs for the Living God how I
[1:55:57] longed and so he had such a burden it's
[1:56:00] such a desire Lord I want to I want to
[1:56:02] come into the secret of my tabernacle
[1:56:04] you know I was looking for looking for
[1:56:06] that time Ezekiel was you know no doubt
[1:56:08] he was stirred up Lord when will you
[1:56:10] fulfill this prophecy I want to see it
[1:56:12] fulfilled no I just want to ask you a
[1:56:15] question
[1:56:16] well now we're on streets ago just
[1:56:19] imagine the raptures happened
[1:56:20] we're on streets of gold so eternal
[1:56:24] youth camp we're all 18 to 21
[1:56:25] alright and we began their fellowship
[1:56:28] and you begin to see you know remember
[1:56:31] the prophets wanted your day they would
[1:56:34] give any onion I don't know how it would
[1:56:36] have been but just so if there's an
[1:56:37] option I'll give two arms two legs on
[1:56:40] the beginning you know they would want
[1:56:41] to be in your day wouldn't you want to
[1:56:43] be in this day we look at the wrong
[1:56:45] thing too much and then no doubt you
[1:56:48] know you know maybe bumming to Ezekiel
[1:56:50] and and and and and you would ask you oh
[1:56:52] he's a prophet Ezekiel or you see the
[1:56:54] Lord is aware within the we'll come down
[1:56:56] and all those Isles in that one you know
[1:56:58] and and and he would tell you about his
[1:57:00] day
[1:57:01] we're in captivity way to burden him
[1:57:04] even though rusty oh yeah because
[1:57:06] Ezekiel this isn't Ezekiel that God said
[1:57:09] though these people that come and sit
[1:57:11] among you they've got idols in their
[1:57:12] hearts right they don't worship God
[1:57:15] according to truth they have idols in
[1:57:17] the heart set you know that
[1:57:18] and so he would have a burden but Lord
[1:57:20] you said that I will put my spirit
[1:57:23] within you and then you'll walk they'll
[1:57:27] walkin according to your statutes and
[1:57:29] they will keep your judgments you say
[1:57:31] when is this going to happen and so and
[1:57:33] so then David would come along no doubt
[1:57:35] and then you to others as King David
[1:57:37] what was it like to face Goliath and you
[1:57:39] all these things you know and they were
[1:57:41] cheer and you know be a wonderful and
[1:57:42] you'd have a jubilee with them and you
[1:57:44] dance around for a few thousand years
[1:57:45] and holier what was it like for the ark
[1:57:47] to come in and your day Yahoo does I'll
[1:57:49] show you I was like holy yeah but then
[1:57:52] that ask you now so where did you come
[1:57:55] from and they say oh they do see ya they
[1:58:00] do see ya
[1:58:00] what was it like
[1:58:02] well and this is how some of us really
[1:58:04] are it was the darkest of times as
[1:58:08] perilous times the Bible said it was
[1:58:09] perilous there be lovers of pleasure
[1:58:12] more than lovers of God false
[1:58:14] you know trucebreakers you know in
[1:58:17] content despisers of those that are good
[1:58:19] trading traitors heady highminded lovers
[1:58:21] of police among lovers of god having a
[1:58:23] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:58:25] they're all from such turn away
[1:58:27] it was very dark age nothing was right
[1:58:29] nothing was wrong it was all gray the
[1:58:31] whole of society was against me you know
[1:58:33] such a pressure in the and the
[1:58:35] bombardment of the enemy when I walk out
[1:58:37] my door and you know but they said no
[1:58:39] what was it like I'm trying to tell you
[1:58:42] what was like it was very dark and this
[1:58:44] all happened no member here his people
[1:58:47] in the desire was never made in this
[1:58:49] life what was it like to have God live
[1:58:52] in you what was it like to be the Living
[1:58:54] Tabernacle Living God where it wasn't
[1:58:57] just my heart longs for you but the
[1:58:59] expectation was met I mean with God came
[1:59:02] and dwelt in you we'll just under the
[1:59:03] blood of bulls and goats
[1:59:04] I mean being anointed one time but God
[1:59:06] comes and dwells hallelujah what was
[1:59:08] that like Holly well as that night we
[1:59:11] were lighting for that day we had a
[1:59:13] burnin love Wayne will you restore your
[1:59:14] people when we come and dwell in your
[1:59:16] people and then will you give back
[1:59:18] everything Adam loss will be restored
[1:59:20] Holly you think Adam would have been
[1:59:22] like you would have talked to him what's
[1:59:23] it like to walk out the garden I think
[1:59:27] and then he says where did you come from
[1:59:28] what was it like to walk back in
[1:59:31] hallelujah what was like to walk back
[1:59:33] into eternity what was like to receive
[1:59:35] everything I lost oh I could command
[1:59:37] every there's a tree move here move here
[1:59:40] do this but then I see her a few days
[1:59:43] later I see the same words who didn't do
[1:59:44] anything and the enemy was oppressing us
[1:59:48] and I told my descendants what it was
[1:59:50] like and this is then men begin to call
[1:59:52] upon the name of the Lord because they
[1:59:54] will say Lord when are we going back
[1:59:56] hallelujah and then here you were Oh
[1:59:58] Lord we look at the wrong thing they
[2:00:03] think you think David would be excited
[2:00:05] in a meeting like this you think they
[2:00:07] would have been excited being Bing in
[2:00:09] your pew amen he was hearing a longing
[2:00:12] where maula alone I longed for thee
[2:00:16] I want more than just what I have he
[2:00:18] couldn't live any higher than the blood
[2:00:19] of bulls and goats hallelujah amen do
[2:00:22] you think he'd get excited you think his
[2:00:24] cup what was life you'll cut the run
[2:00:27] over
[2:00:27] oh my didn't you think what was life for
[2:00:30] y'all cut the run over hallelujah when
[2:00:32] your expectation and what does
[2:00:34] expectation it wasn't met it was met
[2:00:36] hallelujah
[2:00:38] think about it they had along there to
[2:00:40] burden Lord winners it's going to be
[2:00:42] fulfilled imagine receiving the Apostle
[2:00:45] Paul comes along I mean but when he
[2:00:47] wrote to the Thessalonians they which
[2:00:49] are alive and remain they meant to the
[2:00:51] coming of the Lord he was writing you
[2:00:54] would have got that letter you know he
[2:00:57] go to the mailbox I'd know however it
[2:00:59] happened courier came along the Apostle
[2:01:01] Paul says this I'll show you a mystery
[2:01:04] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[2:01:07] changed they mend another place they
[2:01:09] which are alive and remain tonight you
[2:01:11] know the Deen Christ will rise first all
[2:01:14] those different things they would have
[2:01:15] thought it was deep right and and it was
[2:01:18] them because they died right they were
[2:01:20] dead in Christ but they thought they
[2:01:22] were alive and remain and they and they
[2:01:25] died with an expectation and then here
[2:01:27] we are we don't just have an expectation
[2:01:29] we're gonna live the expectation but
[2:01:32] it's going to be fulfilled
[2:01:33] hallelujah we're going to live it out I
[2:01:35] mean without alerting Lord when is it
[2:01:37] gonna happen when's it gonna happen and
[2:01:39] we say it's happening it's happening
[2:01:40] it's happening hallelujah so what was it
