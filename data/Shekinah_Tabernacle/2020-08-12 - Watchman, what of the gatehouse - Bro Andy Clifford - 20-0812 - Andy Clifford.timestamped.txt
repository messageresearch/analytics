[38:13] now
[38:14] and then it's forever yours he's forever
[38:16] yours amen so let's read for zion's sake
[38:20] will i not hold my peace and for
[38:22] jerusalem's sake
[38:24] i will not rest
[38:28] until the righteousness thereof go forth
[38:31] as brightness
[38:33] and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
[38:35] burneth
[38:36] and the gentiles shall see thy
[38:38] righteousness
[38:41] and all the kings thy glory and thou
[38:44] shalt be called by a new name
[38:46] which the mouth of the lord shall name
[38:49] thou shalt also i like that the mouth of
[38:52] the lord shall name
[38:54] bride hello bride the mouth of the lord
[38:57] has named you hallelujah remember this
[39:01] we speak of natural jerusalem but
[39:03] there's a spiritual jerusalem
[39:04] and you are that spiritual jerusalem you
[39:07] are the
[39:07] that you are zion amen so the spiritual
[39:11] jerusalem is in you and we're going to
[39:12] toggle between the natural and the
[39:14] spiritual jerusalem for the evening
[39:17] and we're going to also just to give you
[39:18] a context i'm not going to
[39:20] go too long on this but the the
[39:24] the temple began in the time of the
[39:26] apostles and
[39:27] and then it it went through an at seven
[39:29] church ages and it'll be restored again
[39:32] same as when solomon built the temple it
[39:34] was glorious
[39:35] and then it went and fell and they went
[39:36] through a dark age and then it came back
[39:38] as a restoration
[39:39] okay so that's kind of around the
[39:42] thought
[39:43] just so that we get some context as we
[39:44] read thou shalt
[39:46] also be a crown of glory
[39:49] oh sorry let me go from verse two again
[39:53] and the gentiles shall see thy
[39:54] righteousness and all kings thy glory
[39:56] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[39:58] which the mouth of the lord shall name
[40:00] thou shalt also be a crown of glory in
[40:03] the hand of the lord with the royal
[40:05] diadem in the hand of thy god
[40:07] thou shalt no more be termed forsaken
[40:10] thou
[40:10] neither shall thy land any more be
[40:12] termed desolate
[40:14] praise the lord hallelujah that's a
[40:16] powerful thing you know you own it it's
[40:18] yours

[40:28] forsaken
[40:29] the bible says you will not be alone
[40:31] amen
[40:36] hallelujah
[40:38] but thou shalt be called hepsivah and
[40:41] thy land
[40:42] beulah for the lord delights anew
[40:45] and thy land shall be married oh my
[40:48] hallelujah hello bride you sing uh me

[41:26] bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee

[51:28] you know the enemy says like sam bell
[51:29] can these stones live
[51:31] they were all lang ruined and covered in
[51:33] moss they didn't look very good but they
[51:35] were living stones predestined
[51:37] to be part of your wall so that you can
[51:40] have a gatehouse
[51:41] so that you can have a watchman and
[51:42] every gate to control what goes in and
[51:45] control what goes out by the holy ghost
[51:48] who is in gatehouse making the decisions
[51:50] because it should be lord
[51:52] because we've had a watchman over the
[51:53] age he's come to restore what a real
[51:56] watchman should do
[51:57] what the holy ghost would say yes to and
[51:59] say no to
[52:01] who's in your gatehouse hallelujah
[52:04] i'm questioning myself here you know
[52:06] because we all

[52:37] i think i've done this in vietnam
[52:39] they're holding the mic thing you know i
[52:41] praise god amen
[52:43] we'll let subconscious do this
[52:46] you know me ma'am i get i i crush things

[52:52] tight and i was like just so intense you
[52:54] could get all those right you know
[52:55] you're recording
[52:56] and i look at my knuckles and they're
[52:57] white so let's hope that that doesn't
[53:00] happen
[53:01] oh my let's relax you know the lord
[53:04] really was speaking to me
[53:06] if i just relax then he'll fellowship

[53:14] man we just got to relax let him have
[53:17] his way
[53:18] hallelujah
[53:21] so just ask that question what is what's
[53:23] happening with your city walls
[53:25] and what's happening with your gatehouse
[53:28] you know you know i'm not pointing
[53:29] fingers at anybody or any
[53:32] situation you know this is these are
[53:34] just questions we need to ask ourselves
[53:36] because you see when we ask these
[53:38] questions and no matter how deeply it
[53:40] gets into your home
[53:41] or into your bedroom or into your living
[53:43] room or into your entry
[53:44] depending where you've bought into in
[53:46] your own home
[53:48] that's it's there is reparation there is
[53:52] restoration
[53:53] there is a power in here that can create
[53:55] a world that can spit stars
[53:57] oh man do you realize it let's just
[54:00] realize that by now
[54:01] think about that right now we serve god
[54:03] star breathing god
[54:06] if he can breathe a star seven set clean
[54:09] of them and know all of them by name
[54:12] how much more can he oh my how much more
[54:15] can he restore your laws tonight can he
[54:18] revive your walls can he revive your
[54:20] gates
[54:22] so that you know your battle becomes a
[54:23] little bit easier
[54:25] you don't get bombarded down it might
[54:28] i'm not saying your battle is going to
[54:29] stop amen but you know sometimes
[54:32] we've got so much stuff going on and
[54:34] we've learned that we're just bombarded
[54:35] down and you're
[54:36] crushed under but you don't have to be
[54:38] crushed under hallelujah
[54:41] but you've got to operate the dung gate

[54:45] the only one that really stood out to me
[54:47] was the dung gate there's a lot of them
[54:51] in there
[54:52] but the dungate i just thought i like
[54:53] this we're going to hit that
[54:56] it was just inspired to me that dumb
[54:58] gate needs to get some traffic
[55:00] hallelujah it needs to be it needs to be
[55:03] a lot of outgoing you know
[55:04] hello because the only thing we take
[55:06] with us is our character you know we've
[55:08] got to empty out
[55:09] hallelujah there's a song that says
[55:13] oh my loving lord you get to a place
[55:15] where you're just like lord i don't want

[58:12] we do
[58:13] to to assist to come underneath to push
[58:16] and to deliver and to heal
[58:18] and to declare he said if you love me
[58:22] you'll keep my commandments
[58:23] and i will manifest myself to you
[58:28] that is the king of kings the lord of
[58:30] lords
[58:31] the jesus christ to manifest himself
[58:35] to us that is to openly reveal himself
[58:38] to declare himself
[58:39] to make himself known in our life to us
[58:43] for us to help us
[58:47] they didn't have that and they went
[58:49] through all sorts of different
[58:52] treacherous times and for many years i
[58:54] thought
[58:55] how they just had joshua they just had
[58:58] moses they just had all this
[59:00] and look where they are i never realized
[59:02] that that's the condition
[59:04] that we can get ourselves into too that
[59:06] tortures can get into
[59:08] we're in a time where the devil is using
[59:10] everything
[59:12] to infiltrate and he doesn't just
[59:14] infiltrate and then destroy straight
[59:16] away
[59:16] he has sleeper cells they come in and
[59:19] they wait for years
[59:21] then all of a sudden when the teenagers
[59:23] start to erupt
[59:24] then he opens up those things that we're
[59:26] letting when they were seven or eight
[59:28] stuff like that i'm telling you he's not
[59:31] stupid
[59:32] but he is stupid because he fight god
[59:34] anyone that fights god is very stupid
[59:37] but he's still you know you can't
[59:38] outsmart him oh
[59:41] so let's you know what serves not a
[59:43] faith is sin really
[59:45] and so you see now our gatehouse
[59:49] needs to be operated by faith our
[59:52] gatehouse
[59:53] really needs to be his faith not our
[59:56] faith his faith
[59:57] and his discernment in his decision and
[1:00:00] if we
[1:00:01] are a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:00:05] we will let him decide everything that
[1:00:07] comes in
[1:00:08] and everything that goes out that's very
[1:00:11] simple
[1:00:12] but yet you know there's always a fight
[1:00:15] there's a war there's a battle and it's
[1:00:18] raging
[1:00:18] and there's people and there's human
[1:00:21] this and that and politics and whatnot
[1:00:23] but still at the end of the day what
[1:00:26] right is right and what's wrong with
[1:00:28] amen what is babylon as babylon and what
[1:00:31] is heaven is him
[1:00:32] and i believe i'm speaking to a heavenly

[1:00:35] culture
[1:00:36] they have a heavenly economy you are not
[1:00:39] subject to the monetary system

[1:07:13] done that before
[1:07:14] oh my you know you get it at a time
[1:07:16] where your mind you say the wrong thing
[1:07:18] and that can cause trouble
[1:07:24] but we should discern and our gates
[1:07:26] should be allowing
[1:07:28] things in based on the national faith
[1:07:31] you know what our national faith is who
[1:07:33] knows what our national faith is
[1:07:36] well our nation ain't no new zealand our

[1:07:54] judge you righteous
[1:07:56] so that you can come be a part of that
[1:07:58] and he opened the seals and revealed
[1:08:00] himself
[1:08:01] that is the culture that has been
[1:08:03] revealed to you
[1:08:05] and it came with power it came with
[1:08:07] anointing
[1:08:08] so that you can attain it you don't have
[1:08:11] to try and earn it you don't pick
[1:08:13] yourself up with push-ups pull-ups and

[1:08:46] anointing and a power to restore
[1:08:49] when you honor his word when you honor
[1:08:51] him
[1:08:52] there is more power in him than the
[1:08:53] devil and when you let the devil in
[1:08:56] you're using the devil's power to to
[1:08:59] operate
[1:09:00] why would you want to let the devil
[1:09:01] operate in your life why would you want
[1:09:04] to utilize the devil to keep your family

[1:09:10] that
[1:09:10] compromise it might be sweet for a
[1:09:13] season

[1:12:50] because you like them it must be a human
[1:12:52] nature you know
[1:12:54] i like that amen hallelujah
[1:13:02] a watchman needs to be under the same
[1:13:03] vision as the nation's leadership
[1:13:09] discern and shine light on the common
[1:13:12] issues
[1:13:13] a city faces when a watchmen don't do a
[1:13:17] proper job
[1:13:19] social security is compromised spyware
[1:13:22] and malware
[1:13:23] threats enemies reconnaissance
[1:13:26] installed in your land do you know what
[1:13:29] reconnaissance means
[1:13:31] that's when the enemy army comes in and
[1:13:35] they covert they don't show themselves
[1:13:38] and they might pose as civilians
[1:13:39] that they're in there and they're
[1:13:41] watching
[1:13:43] when you let the wrong things on
[1:13:48] and they cause a lot of trouble those
[1:13:50] are the real nasty ones you know
[1:13:52] they're like the sas they don't send the
[1:13:54] imagery of those missions
[1:13:55] they send the sas and they send the
[1:13:57] delta force they send the
[1:13:59] marines and all of those top watch
[1:14:01] soldiers
[1:14:02] they send those ones for reckon right
[1:14:05] into the enemy's camp
[1:14:07] amen in this case right into the
[1:14:10] for the to the lord's camp and you if
[1:14:12] you if your gate man
[1:14:14] is not right or is blind or has been
[1:14:17] impaired by some
[1:14:18] set conscience or something in your life
[1:14:20] that you've allowed in
[1:14:21] you know spirits you know sin is
[1:14:23] deceitful and it starts to cloud your
[1:14:25] judgment
[1:14:26] and it starts to make you make decisions
[1:14:28] that are not right and you don't even
[1:14:29] realize it
[1:14:31] and then your subconscious starts to do
[1:14:34] things and operate
[1:14:36] and you don't even know your diet just
[1:14:38] happens
[1:14:39] and you go oh and it burned your heart
[1:14:42] and you think man why did i do that
[1:14:44] it just happened before you even know
[1:14:47] because the gates have allowed the wrong
[1:14:50] things in
[1:14:51] or the dungate hasn't got the wrong
[1:14:54] things out because remember
[1:14:57] there's an out there's restoration and
[1:15:00] we are in that time of restoration
[1:15:02] but you see this whole purpose is
[1:15:03] consider your gates
[1:15:05] consider your walls now i'm not saying
[1:15:07] that you're all of us and all of that
[1:15:09] but i'm this is a consideration service
[1:15:11] this is a service where we can consider
[1:15:14] what are my gates doing are there any
[1:15:16] gates
[1:15:17] i mean you know a city built without
[1:15:18] walls is like you know a broken spirit
[1:15:20] right
[1:15:22] and it all ties back to your human
[1:15:23] spirit it all ties back to how you have
[1:15:26] relationships
[1:15:26] how you interact what how things affect
[1:15:29] you
[1:15:30] and then you got to go why why are
[1:15:32] things affect him like this
[1:15:34] why am i like this and then you allow
[1:15:36] gold
[1:15:37] you say here i am lord open
[1:15:41] he's a great physician he's a great
[1:15:43] physician
[1:15:44] if you just hop on operating table you
[1:15:47] know
[1:15:47] and let him operate it's so simple
[1:15:52] and you know sometimes these things we
[1:15:54] we we
[1:15:55] we we clam up and you know sometimes we
[1:15:57] think ah
[1:15:58] and you know when that when the
[1:15:59] anointing's there when the angel like
[1:16:01] peter in the prison the angels are
[1:16:02] sweating
[1:16:04] you know the devil's on the other side
[1:16:05] reasoning just dreaming it's all just a
[1:16:07] dream
[1:16:08] hey do you remember the story he thought
[1:16:09] it was a dream
[1:16:11] there's reasoning just a dream go sit
[1:16:13] back down
[1:16:14] wake up don't but you know if peter
[1:16:17] didn't obey the angel the chains
[1:16:18] wouldn't have fallen off right
[1:16:20] said when he the angel and to me that's
[1:16:23] like a service
[1:16:24] where the lord moving and he's down on
[1:16:26] your alley he's coming down into your
[1:16:28] room
[1:16:28] down into your living room and he's
[1:16:30] coming down into your conversations
[1:16:32] down into your sinking down into your
[1:16:34] troubles

[1:16:38] he smite you on the side
[1:16:39] says get up rise up peter rise up
[1:16:43] rise up and as he rose the chains fell
[1:16:45] off
[1:16:46] you see so it's time for you to rise up
[1:16:49] out of it
[1:16:49] when the angel of the lord comes and
[1:16:51] smites you on the side
[1:16:53] rise up out of your chains you see peter
[1:16:56] was the head of the church right
[1:16:58] it even happened to him that's not when
[1:17:01] none of us
[1:17:02] are exempt and we will all go through
[1:17:06] troubles
[1:17:06] and we will all have troubles and we
[1:17:08] will all fail but it's he that gets back
[1:17:10] up
[1:17:11] and there is an angel of the lord that
[1:17:13] has come down in this end time
[1:17:15] he's come to smite you on the side amen
[1:17:18] he's come to smite on the side so that
[1:17:21] you can rise up out of your chains
[1:17:23] amen those chains fell off
[1:17:26] but that wasn't the end of it after the
[1:17:29] chains fall off you gotta start walking
[1:17:31] you gotta walk at lunch you know when
[1:17:34] you're a future to me man
[1:17:35] we're kind of constantly a future from
[1:17:37] the devil's kingdom
[1:17:38] we're just out of his prison and he's
[1:17:40] trying to chase you down
[1:17:42] he's trying to keep you back and put you
[1:17:44] back in jail but you've got an
[1:17:45] angel the angel of the lord encampeth
[1:17:48] about those that fear him
[1:17:50] they say you've got an angel tonight you
[1:17:53] can rise up right now
[1:17:55] and you can let the chains fall off so
[1:17:57] that you can walk out of that prison
[1:17:59] and when you walk out the reasoning
[1:18:02] of the dream will stop and you'll
[1:18:05] realize i'm free
[1:18:07] and then you can walk for 50 yards of
[1:18:08] elbow room
[1:18:10] oh my god that's 50 yards
[1:18:13] no devil let us cram you down you can
[1:18:16] walk and be free
[1:18:17] amen walk it large
[1:18:20] walk at lunch amen you know what that
[1:18:23] means
[1:18:23] you're free from the prison you're free
[1:18:26] from the government
[1:18:27] hallelujah amen
[1:18:30] not this government but the earthly
[1:18:32] government amen
[1:18:34] but when you get free from the early
[1:18:35] government you come into the heavenly
[1:18:37] government
[1:18:38] amen hallelujah

[1:18:52] infected and disease threats this is now
[1:18:56] the these are just
[1:18:57] results of uh you could say
[1:19:01] a dysfunctional watchman or a city
[1:19:04] without walls
[1:19:05] a broken spirit so infected diseases and
[1:19:08] threats
[1:19:09] now it's physically sicknesses and
[1:19:11] plagues
[1:19:12] spiritual and physical so there's you
[1:19:14] know these things

[1:19:20] what's coming in based on your domain
[1:19:23] because you have domains right children
[1:19:25] have their domain themselves and
[1:19:27] they're a brother or a sister a son and
[1:19:29] a daughter and they're in school or
[1:19:31] whatever they are their influence
[1:19:33] you have a domain and over yourself you
[1:19:36] have a domain
[1:19:38] amen now you can discern what comes in
[1:19:42] children at school you can discern am i
[1:19:45] going to allow that thought
[1:19:47] that that person tom come in or am i
[1:19:49] gonna say no
[1:19:50] the bible says this about me i'm
[1:19:52] daughter of god i'm a son of god
[1:19:55] i don't have to do those things i'm not
[1:19:57] gonna have those things come into my
[1:19:58] gates

[1:20:13] is there anyone right this is a secret
[1:20:16] here
[1:20:17] that you can have don't let all those
[1:20:20] other things into your life

[1:20:23] your life just just go lord i don't want
[1:20:24] all those things i don't want to have
[1:20:26] the attitude
[1:20:27] i don't want any of that because you see
[1:20:28] your parents who sees their parent
[1:20:30] having a glorious time huh
[1:20:32] who sees their parents having a good
[1:20:34] time and you think what how do they have
[1:20:36] such a good time
[1:20:37] what are they what are they doing what
[1:20:39] what someone's just yelling at them at
[1:20:40] the front they're having a glorious time
[1:20:42] and the children are looking going how
[1:20:44] does this work how does it work
[1:20:46] well just try it just try it
[1:20:49] get your gates operating say lord of my
[1:20:52] gates
[1:20:52] so that i can have a good time in
[1:20:54] service i want to be in such a place
[1:20:56] that word you know we're preach it's
[1:21:00] glorious i don't have to sit and enjoy
[1:21:02] and think about everything else but
[1:21:04] and actually you shouldn't even be
[1:21:05] thinking about church you should be
[1:21:06] thinking about god
[1:21:08] amen amen church is glorious
[1:21:11] if your gate's functioning good amen
[1:21:14] and we'll be walking with the lord and
[1:21:15] having a good time but then you
[1:21:17] you let the gate down and something
[1:21:19] wrong comes in and then all of a sudden
[1:21:21] church becomes a bit hard for a while
[1:21:23] you wonder what's going on well there's
[1:21:25] something in there that's when the dung
[1:21:26] gate has to operate
[1:21:28] that's when something has to get out of
[1:21:29] your house out of your life
[1:21:31] off your phone out of your tv oh there's
[1:21:34] probably no such thing anymore
[1:21:35] but out of your screen amen
[1:21:38] something's got to go so i can have a
[1:21:40] glorious time
[1:21:42] so i can walk with god amen
[1:21:45] help me lord amen so you know
[1:21:49] the more of the more you allow god to
[1:21:52] purge you
[1:21:53] purify you the more impressionable you
[1:21:56] come
[1:21:57] the more the word affects you the more
[1:22:00] just the thought when it's preached
[1:22:01] you just feel love in your heart you
[1:22:03] think my
[1:22:04] i want to be like this i want to have
[1:22:05] this all the time and you can
[1:22:08] but it's a fight because you see where
[1:22:10] like we just absorb things
[1:22:12] and sometimes you go and you let the
[1:22:13] wrong thing in and then all of a sudden
[1:22:15] your impression ability
[1:22:17] becomes hard and you know and it's like
[1:22:19] the ground becomes hard
[1:22:21] and then you sit and you're enduring and
[1:22:23] what you don't understand something or
[1:22:24] what
[1:22:25] maybe but then all of a sudden the lord
[1:22:27] comes he says i'm here to deliver you
[1:22:29] i'm here to heal that you know the bible
[1:22:31] says break up the fallow ground
[1:22:33] break it up break up the dirt the soil
[1:22:37] you know literally all oxygenate get
[1:22:39] some air in there
[1:22:41] amen so the seeds when the lord reigns
[1:22:44] down in the service
[1:22:46] the seeds just quicken up you know david
[1:22:48] says thy word have i hid in my heart
[1:22:50] that i might not sin against you the
[1:22:52] prophet takes that further and says you
[1:22:54] know david could only do that
[1:22:56] that's all he could do there was no
[1:22:58] quickening power
[1:22:59] to quicken the word that he hid in his
[1:23:01] heart but now
[1:23:03] and tonight break up the fallow ground
[1:23:06] because there's a quicken power to
[1:23:08] quicken the seed
[1:23:10] in your life to bring it to life
[1:23:13] this is what i'm talking about amen
[1:23:17] hallelujah watchmen what are the night
[1:23:20] the night is out here the night is in
[1:23:22] this flesh
[1:23:24] there's a soul inside you good morning
[1:23:27] good morning soul you're in glory you're
[1:23:29] in a glorious place
[1:23:31] but this flesh is nighttime what of the
[1:23:34] night
[1:23:34] what's happening in the night time of
[1:23:36] the life what's happening in this realm
[1:23:38] are you allowing things to come and try
[1:23:40] and get into your jerusalem
[1:23:42] try and get your temple all beaten down
[1:23:44] trying to get it desecrated
[1:23:47] want some babylonian idol erected in
[1:23:49] your temple
[1:23:50] no but did it happen to israel
[1:23:54] it did now i don't believe the devil can
[1:23:57] come into a step heart
[1:23:59] amen he can't get in there but he can
[1:24:01] certainly cause destruction and trouble
[1:24:03] right around
[1:24:04] huh the prophet said even a holy ghost
[1:24:07] for person
[1:24:08] can have mental illness man that's
[1:24:11] pretty extreme
[1:24:12] can have a trouble in there for it's so
[1:24:14] bad they get broken down by a
[1:24:17] mental breakdown mostly emotional
[1:24:20] connections and all that stuff
[1:24:22] can happen but god rich and mercy
[1:24:28] just like that gone
[1:24:31] just let him build jerusalem let him
[1:24:33] build it up amen
[1:24:35] that's what he wants to do he wants to
[1:24:37] come down into your heart
[1:24:39] and he wants to rearrange some things he
[1:24:41] says i want to turn that desolate place
[1:24:43] into an eden again
[1:24:44] i will turn it into a beautiful garden
[1:24:46] again i want the river flowing again
[1:24:49] amen that eaten the river flowed from
[1:24:53] paradise
[1:24:54] to one of the garden you need the river
[1:24:58] amen he the believer for me the out of
[1:25:00] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:25:02] water
[1:25:03] you need the river hey man he creates
[1:25:06] that
[1:25:06] dead condition so that rivers can flow
[1:25:09] from you
[1:25:09] the holy ghost can flow from you to
[1:25:11] water your garden
[1:25:13] to put an influence over your flesh
[1:25:16] over your spirit to make you happy
[1:25:19] subdued
[1:25:20] you know when jesus comes to the real
[1:25:21] earth in the millennium he's down
[1:25:24] and there's there's an idiot condition
[1:25:25] again what's the devil doing
[1:25:28] what can he do he's bound what is he
[1:25:31] bound by
[1:25:33] circumstance what's the circumstance
[1:25:36] jesus and the bride manifest ethernet
[1:25:40] condition
[1:25:41] rivers flowing oh my oh my earth what
[1:25:43] can the devil do
[1:25:45] so if you are having a need in your life
[1:25:48] and the river's flowing
[1:25:49] what can the devil do that's when
[1:25:53] you become an invincible army discerning
[1:25:56] the antichrist spirit
[1:25:58] what is it the gates have got functional
[1:26:01] gatekeepers
[1:26:02] functional watchmen not blinded by some
[1:26:04] sad conscience remember
[1:26:05] your conscience is sad and i know oh i
[1:26:08] know
[1:26:09] and when you see your conscience it's
[1:26:11] not easily
[1:26:12] brought back it takes years and
[1:26:14] something and it actually doesn't have
[1:26:16] to
[1:26:16] because the same divine healing that
[1:26:18] heals your body
[1:26:21] it can be a miracle or it can be over
[1:26:23] time but it will be healed
[1:26:24] because it would above all things that
[1:26:26] you prosper and be in health
[1:26:28] that body is subject to the fall your
[1:26:31] spirit is also subject to the fall
[1:26:33] and so if you've said your conscience or
[1:26:34] your broken memories or whatever it may
[1:26:36] be
[1:26:38] the same divine healer by your his
[1:26:40] stripes
[1:26:41] my conscience was healed so the same
[1:26:44] faith that you have for divine healing
[1:26:46] of your body
[1:26:47] you can have divine healing for your
[1:26:48] spirit honestly
[1:26:50] you can have it you know we think i've
[1:26:52] got to go through countling and you
[1:26:53] there's nothing wrong with counseling i
[1:26:55] need to go through all of this stuff i
[1:26:56] need
[1:26:58] no there's divine healing you can be
[1:27:00] healed
[1:27:01] and then adjust your habits because
[1:27:04] there's one thing you can get here or
[1:27:05] something
[1:27:06] and i've been healed in my conscience
[1:27:07] i've been healed and i've gone back and
[1:27:09] done the same things
[1:27:10] and gone back in the same round i think
[1:27:12] it's harder
[1:27:13] because you sear it you share your
[1:27:15] conscience
[1:27:16] who knows what i'm talking about you
[1:27:18] know it becomes
[1:27:20] easier to do wrong and i'm talking about
[1:27:22] just little things
[1:27:23] and sometimes those things can lead into
[1:27:25] worse things and you can find a person
[1:27:27] a son of god a daughter of god in a bad
[1:27:30] place
[1:27:31] and that's and but i'm talking to those
[1:27:33] people
[1:27:34] you can come back there and maybe it's
[1:27:37] in your dark age
[1:27:38] maybe you've gone through it may and now
[1:27:41] it's time you know there's been a
[1:27:42] reformation
[1:27:43] but now you've got to come out of
[1:27:44] affirmation it's time for you to come
[1:27:46] out of revelation
[1:27:47] it's time for you to come out of
[1:27:49] sanctification now don't lose it
[1:27:51] keep it it's time for you to just get
[1:27:53] beyond
[1:27:54] the supernatural of the gifts and come
[1:27:57] into full
[1:27:58] communion with god come into the
[1:28:01] fullness of god
[1:28:02] hallelujah all of those things need to
[1:28:04] happen in your life right
[1:28:06] you're going through him hey man let me
[1:28:09] just read something
[1:28:10] and then we'll close
[1:28:19] brother branham says the watchman was
[1:28:22] what
[1:28:22] what he was the duties of the watchmen
[1:28:24] in the old testament what was duties of
[1:28:26] the watchmen in the old testament the
[1:28:28] watchman
[1:28:28] was the man that went up to a tower in
[1:28:30] the city
[1:28:32] on the city way high he was higher than
[1:28:35] all
[1:28:36] the footmen because it was his position
[1:28:39] now in order for his men
[1:28:43] for this man to get up there he must
[1:28:44] have a good clear understanding
[1:28:46] and he must have good eyes he must be
[1:28:49] alert he must know the stars
[1:28:51] am i this is deep and you can
[1:28:55] you can read this it's in watchmen mode
[1:28:56] of the night study the sermon
[1:28:58] just actually read it enjoy it afterward
[1:29:00] to speak to you through it that's
[1:29:01] powerful
[1:29:02] he says here clear understanding and he
[1:29:04] must have good eyes
[1:29:06] they must be alert and he and must know
[1:29:08] the stars and
[1:29:09] many qualifications had to be before he
[1:29:12] could
[1:29:12] be a correct watchman and remember the
[1:29:15] lord
[1:29:16] trained he traineth my ends to war
[1:29:20] i asked his brother ben preached on
[1:29:22] sunday if you ask for wisdom you'll get
[1:29:24] wisdom
[1:29:24] god will get to you abundantly so you
[1:29:27] don't have to say i don't know how you
[1:29:28] know
[1:29:28] don't be like that the lord will provide
[1:29:32] everything you need he's given you a
[1:29:34] message to make end time conditions
[1:29:36] and as the devil gets all of his
[1:29:39] unholy intelligence all on here to try
[1:29:41] and get you down there is a greater
[1:29:43] intelligence
[1:29:44] there is a message that's gone forth to
[1:29:46] to give you
[1:29:47] to meet those conditions so you can
[1:29:49] believe that
[1:29:51] and brother branham says i'm afraid
[1:29:53] today that we've put some watchmen in
[1:29:54] there
[1:29:55] that couldn't sepha oh couldn't see all
[1:29:57] this disaster that's a coming
[1:30:00] to warn the people then unqualified a
[1:30:03] watchman
[1:30:03] would soon have a city destroyed because
[1:30:06] the entire city depend
[1:30:08] on the watchman god's watchman
[1:30:11] the watchman is a prime place to attack
[1:30:14] and
[1:30:14] or corrupt at all means possible you
[1:30:18] think about it
[1:30:19] at all means possible the devil do
[1:30:21] everything to corrupt your watchmen in
[1:30:22] your life
[1:30:23] so that he can get to your city so that
[1:30:25] he can bring it down
[1:30:26] so that he can give the devil leverage
[1:30:28] that's what he wants
[1:30:29] he wants the devil to have leverage in
[1:30:31] your life leave her at your job
[1:30:34] leave it in your finances and and when
[1:30:36] you break off from the
[1:30:37] word of god and what's been revealed
[1:30:39] under the opening of the word
[1:30:41] and the and and things that's been
[1:30:43] prescribed
[1:30:44] when you veer out of it by your
[1:30:46] reasoning and searing your conscience
[1:30:48] then trouble comes then that watchman
[1:30:51] allows things in
[1:30:53] but be careful be careful
[1:30:57] because the devil's trying to attack
[1:30:58] that because he knows that when that
[1:31:00] gets attacked
[1:31:01] it can cause trouble in life but a
[1:31:03] watchman which colludes with the enemy
[1:31:06] a watchman that has become worldly and
[1:31:08] spiritually numb
[1:31:09] a watchman that is detached from the
[1:31:11] importance of his post
[1:31:16] brother bran says this i'm just going to
[1:31:18] read for the rest the what the morning
[1:31:20] cometh and the night also
[1:31:22] now we're in the dark time the loud
[1:31:25] descent church age
[1:31:26] man lukewarm not able to stand the
[1:31:29] things of god
[1:31:30] they pull themselves off separating like
[1:31:32] it was in the days of noah
[1:31:34] but the morning star shines right off
[1:31:36] them
[1:31:37] i like that the morning star has come as
[1:31:40] a morning as a daytime as a
[1:31:42] good morning shalom to the bride but yet
[1:31:45] there's darkness everywhere and it's a
[1:31:46] time of darkness but the star shines
[1:31:49] on all
[1:31:53] the power of god the holy spirit he says
[1:31:55] jesus said the works that i do shall you
[1:31:57] do also greater than this shall you do
[1:31:59] because i go to my father
[1:32:00] he promised the power he said a little
[1:32:02] while and the world won't see me no more

[1:32:17] church

[1:37:40] that we're going to close it says here
[1:37:42] you know
[1:37:43] it's time for a restoration and
[1:37:44] rebuilding of watchmen
[1:37:46] and the spiritual infrastructure that
[1:37:48] supports
[1:37:49] the important placement of the watchmen
[1:37:52] in our lives
[1:37:53] the process happens as i discussed
[1:37:57] you go you know you have a temple that's
[1:37:59] beautiful
[1:38:00] you have a relationship that's beautiful
[1:38:02] and you come to the lord and you're in
[1:38:04] your first love and everything's pretty
[1:38:05] everything's glorious the grass is
[1:38:07] greener everything smells nice and the
[1:38:09] sky is blue
[1:38:11] and then trials come and then all the
[1:38:14] temptations come
[1:38:15] and then you find yourself in places
[1:38:17] that you never thought you
[1:38:18] even had in your life anymore but they
[1:38:21] started coming out
[1:38:22] but there is a time of restoration amen
[1:38:26] there is a time now and we're in that
[1:38:28] season
[1:38:29] we have to come to that place and the
[1:38:31] lord is bringing us right up into it
[1:38:33] so that we can walk in the fullness of
[1:38:36] it
[1:38:37] he says here you know this is in
[1:38:39] nehemiah 2 verse 1.
[1:38:41] he says now remember this when i read
[1:38:44] this

[1:38:47] know
[1:38:48] there's a queen by his eye it's very
[1:38:50] powerful
[1:38:51] he says here and it came to pass in the
[1:38:54] nissan in the twentieth year of dirk
[1:38:57] sees the king
[1:38:59] that that wine was before him and i took
[1:39:01] up the lion and gave it unto the king

[1:39:06] said in his presence wherefore the king
[1:39:08] said unto me

[1:41:28] failing at it over and over
[1:41:30] but you can live with it but you don't
[1:41:32] want to live with it because you know
[1:41:33] it's just unbelief

[1:41:37] getting between you and the lord
[1:41:39] and i've got them we all got them

[1:42:12] now you can't believe because this is a
[1:42:14] season you know there's reasoning
[1:42:16] but remember peter got up remember peter
[1:42:18] shocked those teens
[1:42:20] tonight gonna get up and you're gonna
[1:42:22] shake those chains
[1:42:23] because the angel of the lord has
[1:42:25] encamped about those defeat him
[1:42:27] who fears the lord hallelujah
[1:42:30] so there's something tonight that you
[1:42:33] can have
[1:42:34] that you could claim because it's the
[1:42:36] season
[1:42:37] for you to have it it's the season

[1:42:57] tonight you shall be free tonight you
[1:43:00] are going to have divine healing happen
[1:43:02] in your spirit
[1:43:02] or in your body whatever you need but i
[1:43:05] encourage you
[1:43:06] the body you know it's all right these
[1:43:08] elements almonds
[1:43:09] they'll come and they'll go but your
[1:43:11] spirit is causing you more trouble than
[1:43:13] more bodily ailments
[1:43:15] way more trouble those are those the
[1:43:18] weaknesses those are the
[1:43:20] brokenness that is causing the enemy to
[1:43:22] be able to get into your
[1:43:24] land dampen down the fire of your temple
[1:43:27] oh my i'm gonna go right to the end now
[1:43:31] and read the final things
[1:43:40] now just to set the scene remember
[1:43:43] nehemiah had a vision
[1:43:44] and he he had to he was sorrowful that
[1:43:47] he approached the king
[1:43:48] and tonight you're like nehemiah and you
[1:43:52] are approaching the king
[1:43:53] because you have brought the king wine
[1:43:55] you have you have made in the whole
[1:43:57] a cold drink amen from the will of
[1:43:59] bethlehem hallelujah
[1:44:01] amen who's been freed who's been set
[1:44:04] free amen
[1:44:06] who was like rahab once upon a time and
[1:44:08] all your life crumbled away
[1:44:10] because of the voice of bloody angel
[1:44:12] because of the message of the hour
[1:44:14] that set you free so then
[1:44:17] what happened after she got set free
[1:44:19] there was bethlehem
[1:44:20] they founded bethlehem so you are part
[1:44:24] of that place
[1:44:25] and you can by default by predestination
[1:44:29] by eternal inheritance you can give him
[1:44:32] a drink tonight
[1:44:33] that's you are the cupbearer of the king
[1:44:36] you are
[1:44:37] the one that can bring him a drink amen
[1:44:40] so before the king like nehemiah you can
[1:44:42] say lord
[1:44:43] it's time for my walls to be built it's
[1:44:46] time
[1:44:47] hallelujah for for the right functions
[1:44:50] of my spirit again

[1:48:08] oh my glorious times and then you've
[1:48:11] gone through a few things
[1:48:12] you've had a new battles if you're
[1:48:13] scared and a few problems and
[1:48:15] failed literally many times and now it's
[1:48:18] time for the restoration
[1:48:19] of your life it's time for the temple

[1:48:24] might not be as good looking
[1:48:26] god doesn't care he's not caring about
[1:48:28] the prettiness
[1:48:30] the makeup of caring about it the great
[1:48:33] cold and the great things
[1:48:34] he's not worried about that what he's
[1:48:36] worried about the temple is really fun
[1:48:39] a temple that's ready for god to come on
[1:48:41] flesh
[1:48:42] to come on the earth remember we're
[1:48:44] right before the millennium
[1:48:53] the governor of judah and to joshua son
[1:48:55] of joseph
[1:48:56] the high priest and to the residue of
[1:48:59] the people saying
[1:49:01] who was left among you that saw this
[1:49:03] house in her first glory
[1:49:07] and how do you see it now
[1:49:12] is that that singing
[1:49:18] in comparison of it as nothing you know
[1:49:21] sometimes you feel like you're just
[1:49:22] nothing
[1:49:23] and really you think that and maybe you
[1:49:26] think of
[1:49:26] all those glorious things or whatever it
[1:49:28] may be like uh
[1:49:30] you know you you it becomes like almost
[1:49:32] like a a delusive
[1:49:34] memory of what it was and all those
[1:49:38] things and how it was but
[1:49:39] actually even though you've gone through
[1:49:41] it all
[1:49:42] what you're going into is far
[1:49:46] far more glorious far far more gross
[1:49:49] than you could ever imagine
[1:49:51] eyes not seen nor is there heard nor is
[1:49:54] it entered the heart of man the thing
[1:49:55] which god has prepared for them that
[1:49:57] love him
[1:49:58] and the glory of this restored temple of
[1:50:00] your life
[1:50:01] the jerusalem of your life the temple
[1:50:03] that you are
[1:50:04] in jerusalem is more humble
[1:50:11] you see that first temple now i'm not
[1:50:13] putting down anything this is just in
[1:50:15] this type
[1:50:16] you can't stretch it out but in this
[1:50:18] type you have this glorious temple that
[1:50:20] looks so
[1:50:21] great and it was but the corporal
[1:50:25] being of the lord did not come to that
[1:50:28] temple
[1:50:29] and then here right at the end right it
[1:50:32] was rebuilt
[1:50:34] and it was good it wasn't as good it
[1:50:36] didn't look as it wasn't as rich
[1:50:38] it was humble on the outside who came to
[1:50:41] it
[1:50:42] let's read it he says he says is it not
[1:50:45] in your eyes
[1:50:46] and comparison of it is nothing hair guy
[1:50:49] two verse nine
[1:50:51] the glory of this letter house shall be
[1:50:52] greater than of the former
[1:50:54] saith the lord of hosts and in this
[1:50:57] place
[1:50:58] i will give peace to the lord hosts

[1:52:16] full soap
[1:52:18] and tonight i believe that we're
[1:52:19] experiencing that and he
[1:52:21] shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of
[1:52:23] silver
[1:52:24] and he shall purify the sons of levi and
[1:52:27] purge them
[1:52:28] as gold and silver that they may offer

[1:52:54] but people begin to say hosanna in the
[1:52:56] highest hosanna to the king of kings
[1:52:59] hosanna to the son of david who said it
[1:53:01] to him that comes in the name of the
