[2:15] good evening welcome to the house of God
[2:19] it's Eid here I thought I saw the
[2:21] children here is your dad here he's
[2:25] outside
[2:25] brother Eid is he I thought I could hear
[2:33] him but I wasn't quite sure see I think
[2:40] if I have to look at I know kind of here
[2:44] I was going to say if I have to look at
[2:50] him pick who's being lost on the bush I
[2:52] would probably pick brother Chris his
[2:55] beards a bit longer makeup underneath
[3:02] brother Chris has been lost out at sea
[3:05] for a while
[3:11] okay let's stand up this evening and
[3:16] let's come up this night to the Lord
[3:17] wheel under great anticipation to hear
[3:20] from the Lord tonight and to be
[3:22] refreshing the Spirit of God to hear to
[3:24] hear the word of God and to be enriched
[3:27] and to leave here better than what we
[3:29] were when we came and to look upon the
[3:32] unseen things tonight not the things
[3:35] that are seen but their minds look on to
[3:37] the unseen because those the unseen
[3:39] things are eternal the natural things
[3:41] are temporal so we want to look on to
[3:44] the eternal this evening and focus all
[3:46] of our minds and all of our attention
[3:48] and all of the effort onto the unseen
[3:50] onto the kingdom of God and walk by
[3:54] faith and act and faith this evening too
[3:57] to just experience something that we
[4:00] can't see and yet will experience it
[4:01] because it's more real than what this is
[4:03] and yeah let's just pray this evening
[4:07] Heavenly Father we thank you that we can
[4:09] be gathered here again this evening and
[4:11] we just some want to take this

[4:24] feel welcome in our in our midst Lord

[4:33] they glorify you and may they may they
[4:35] welcome you into our midst

[5:53] sense we can't see it but it's there and

[26:03] but Lord Jesus only you Father can open
[26:07] it only you can reveal the love language

[26:40] said Amen hallelujah bless you this
[26:45] evening thank you musicians it is just
[26:48] so wonderful to be here and you know
[26:51] just in a short time we can go from an
[26:53] atmosphere of very busy very full of the
[26:58] tree of knowledge and the things that we
[27:00] have to do during the day if that's you
[27:04] know what we're called to do in a our
[27:05] life outside of our church life and
[27:08] personal life you know and very quickly
[27:11] the Lord can take us from that
[27:13] atmosphere into this you know and into a
[27:16] place where you know we're caught up in
[27:18] heavenly places amen and you know and
[27:21] and that doesn't negate the fact that
[27:22] when you're out there that you should
[27:24] also have that atmosphere but this is
[27:27] this is there's just something different
[27:29] about when the saints gather together
[27:31] and we're here to worship God and that's
[27:34] all we're here to do you know it's it
[27:35] really it's different
[27:37] amen amen hallelujah amen let's just go
[27:42] straight to the word while we're
[27:44] standing oh here we go
[27:48] tonight we're going to speak on part 9
[27:51] of the this is the second to last of the
[27:53] series and you know the series could go
[27:55] on forever because there's just so much
[27:57] but you know that there comes a time
[27:59] where we just have to say it's complete
[28:01] for the series and you know I'm sure the
[28:04] Lord will just continue to reveal
[28:05] himself and other angles and other ways
[28:07] amen because that's what he's doing and
[28:09] he enjoys that and we enjoy it don't we
[28:12] who enjoys the Lord revealing himself to
[28:14] you
[28:15] hallelujah amen hallelujah so tonight
[28:18] we're going to speak on a subject called
[28:19] leave no stone unturned Alleluia amen
[28:23] and may the lord give me wisdom and help
[28:26] me to bring this fall so our opening
[28:29] scripture tonight is Matthew 7 verse 24
[28:34] to 27
[28:37] and it goes like this therefore
[28:42] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[28:45] and doeth them I will liken him unto a
[28:49] wise man which built his house upon a
[28:51] rock and the rain descended and the
[28:54] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[28:56] upon that house and it fell not for it
[28:59] was founded upon a rock and every one
[29:03] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[29:04] doeth them not shall be likened unto a
[29:08] foolish man which built his house upon
[29:10] the sand and the rain descended and the
[29:13] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[29:15] upon that house and it fell and great
[29:19] was the fall of it Lord please hand your
[29:23] blessing to the reading of your word and
[29:26] Jesus name
[29:27] you may be seated I'm going to tie this
[29:35] and further on down in the in the sermon
[29:39] so just don't be alarmed but where we're
[29:43] going next but I want to talk about here
[29:51] there's a difference between a rock and
[29:54] a sand right the rock is a sure
[29:57] foundation the sand and I want to speak
[30:00] I'm going to just talk about sandstone
[30:03] you know you you've seen sandstone it it
[30:05] seems hard it seems like it's got
[30:07] substance but you put that under enough
[30:09] pressure it's going to crumble and
[30:11] become what it were origin amen amen
[30:14] but it took fire to make that rough and
[30:18] wrought the rock and this is actually
[30:21] the revelation and the doing of this
[30:24] because he's Jesus says that a wise man
[30:27] will build his house upon a rock he's
[30:31] the man that hears the sayings of mine
[30:33] and does them now for me Jesus Christ is
[30:37] the rock that's the revelation of Jesus
[30:40] Christ that's the rock now he is the
[30:43] high priest of our profession and the
[30:46] King James but that's like the
[30:48] confession and it's also not
[30:51] just what you say now we are going to
[30:53] deal tonight about what you say but
[30:55] whenever I talk about what you say I
[30:57] want you to keep in your mind the
[31:00] tsunami it's synonymous with what you do
[31:03] because your life is your kin is also a
[31:06] confession your life is also a testimony
[31:10] so let your life and your mouth say the
[31:14] same thing
[31:15] amen so that that confession could be of
[31:18] an equal value between your life and
[31:20] your mouth because both hold very
[31:23] similar value in the kingdom of God and
[31:25] in the spirit world your life is
[31:28] actually when that life is in harmony
[31:31] with the Bible and the word by
[31:34] revelation by a rock amen by a true
[31:36] profession that life is a stable life of
[31:41] substance and that life is what shakes
[31:44] help that life is what is destroying the
[31:47] enemy Alleluia I will go further into
[31:53] that bit later but I just want to delay
[31:54] that deal the next scripture we want to
[31:57] read us from Matthew 21 verse 42 to 44
[31:59] and it says jesus saith unto them did
[32:02] you never read in the scriptures the
[32:05] stone which the builders rejected the
[32:07] same has become the head of the corner
[32:10] just keep that in mind the head of the
[32:12] corner you know what the head of the who
[32:13] knows what the head of the corner is
[32:15] it's the capstone it's the head of the
[32:17] corner
[32:18] amen it's the capstone so the stone that
[32:22] the builders rejected the same has
[32:24] become the head of the corner this is
[32:26] the Lord's doing amen and it is
[32:29] marvelous in our eyes is it marvelous in
[32:31] your eyes are you wouldn't to sing
[32:32] something hallelujah amen are you
[32:35] witnessing a descending of a capstone
[32:38] Amen the sending of the Lord Himself
[32:42] into where and to you and see your life
[32:45] God is laying that stone into your life
[32:50] this is the Lord's doing and it is
[32:52] marvelous in our eyes you cannot
[32:54] manufacture it it cannot be impersonate
[32:56] it amen no one can play Church around
[32:59] here
[32:59] Alleluia do you know why because you
[33:02] can't impersonate the third pool
[33:04] Canon's personate the Lord Himself
[33:07] hallelujah putting on flesh it just
[33:09] cannot be impersonated and when it tries
[33:11] to impersonate it all be found out you
[33:14] can see it because Satan doesn't want to
[33:17] do that does it you kick himself and he
[33:20] can't anyway but even if he did he would
[33:22] just kick himself for living the word he
[33:25] doesn't want to do that why would he
[33:27] want to do that that's why it can't be
[33:29] impersonated because the head at the
[33:31] corner is here amen
[33:32] this is the Lord's doing and it is
[33:34] marvelous in our eyes therefore I say
[33:36] unto you the kingdom of God shall be
[33:38] taken from you and given to a nation
[33:40] bringing forth the fruits thereof and
[33:42] whosoever now this is what this is where
[33:44] the emphasis now for us here and
[33:46] whosoever shall fall on this stone shall
[33:50] be broken and whosoever but whosoever
[33:55] shall fall it shall fall it will grind
[33:58] him to powder amen so you have two
[34:01] choices now you can be broken and
[34:05] rebuilt or be ground to powder and hope
[34:09] for the best man there's a lot good
[34:11] place to be in amen
[34:13] really not a good place to be in you
[34:15] know that I don't know this is just me I
[34:17] don't know whether that means you're
[34:19] completely lost or whether he just has
[34:20] to deal if you're a lot more harder than
[34:22] someone else maybe he has to take a son
[34:24] of God and grind them down to completely
[34:26] nothing so that he can rebuild from
[34:28] powder rather than rebuild from just a
[34:30] bit of a broken life or a trial you know
[34:33] and I don't know this is just me whether
[34:35] sometimes you see people that resist the
[34:37] Lord enough God just breaks them down
[34:39] more than you've ever imagined you know
[34:41] they end up becoming like I think been
[34:44] preached years ago on the sa Abraham was
[34:47] a saved you know it's like you had to
[34:49] grind it down till it was completely
[34:51] nothing and then through your experiment
[34:54] I don't know this is that's just me okay
[34:57] but for for this particular thought we
[35:00] want to fall on the stone
[35:02] now that word fall is a very interesting
[35:04] word it actually means that's the idea
[35:08] of a lighting to fall to fail to fall
[35:13] down or to light on
[35:16] now that word I looked up that and it
[35:19] says here that it's probably a Kenton
[35:21] wool to geo for 72 407 to through the
[35:25] idea of a lighting now that geo for 72
[35:27] means two flights and that's a verb to
[35:30] fly so you see what I was talking about
[35:33] and what I actually was in them in my
[35:35] prayer that this flying you know we want
[35:39] to sometimes sometimes the Eagles got to
[35:41] land and actually deal with some things
[35:43] amen so sometimes you know actually
[35:47] there's seasons in our life where you
[35:49] know we are flying high and we're going
[35:51] up and we're doing things and we move
[35:52] soaring and then there's times where the
[35:55] Eagles just got to land down on the rock
[35:56] and allow the Lord to break them down a
[35:59] little bit maybe take that crust off
[36:01] their head that intellectual
[36:02] understanding of something or some crust
[36:04] that's on their head that needs to be
[36:06] broken off a little bit on the rock so
[36:09] that they can see something that the
[36:10] Lord is trying to show them about
[36:12] himself or about him amen
[36:15] so that they can grow and come further
[36:17] into the very love of God now you see
[36:20] now we need to alight that is that that
[36:24] word a light is like if you could
[36:26] describe it like a bird that is flying
[36:28] and it alights down upon your shoulder
[36:31] amen so when you are walking like a lamb
[36:33] and that Holy Ghost comes down like a
[36:35] dove and the lights upon your shoulder
[36:37] amen he'll come to a lamb nature but you
[36:40] see now you have to also a light down
[36:42] out of your flight sometimes amen and
[36:45] fall on that rock so that he can break
[36:47] you down hallelujah amen romans 9 verse
[36:54] 33 and this is going to place where this
[36:57] rock has been placed for us right here
[37:00] tonight in this generation as it has
[37:04] written behold I lay in Sion a
[37:06] stumbling-stone and a rock of offense
[37:08] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[37:10] be ashamed amen you shall not have the
[37:15] reproach of barrenness amen
[37:17] you shall not be barren no longer
[37:19] because there's going to come you're
[37:21] going to get with the mail amen and he's
[37:23] going to germanized you and you're going
[37:25] to be germinated amen so that you can
[37:27] actually bring forth a life hello
[37:30] now that rock that you need to fall on
[37:32] is actually within you already if you
[37:34] have received her Amen if you have
[37:38] received the Lord Himself hallelujah if
[37:41] you were walking with the Lord Himself
[37:43] and that's that's why the Lord says I'm
[37:45] going to land sigh and I'm going to lay
[37:47] in my bride my stumbling stone
[37:49] hallelujah
[37:50] you know when brother Bannerman this
[37:51] just before the seals was going to open
[37:53] you know he was he came out of their
[37:55] vision that showed him the seven angels
[37:57] and all that sort of stuff and the Bible
[37:58] was open to Roman's 9 and he send the
[38:01] law enter said behold I lay in Sion a
[38:03] stumbling-stone what was happening the
[38:05] the head of the corner the capstone
[38:07] himself was coming to the generation was
[38:10] coming down was going to be revealed now
[38:12] to some it was going to be a stumbling
[38:14] stone to the denominations and to those
[38:16] believers that was going to be a
[38:18] stumbling stone but to the believer amen
[38:21] it was going to be something that's
[38:24] going to stop them from being a shame
[38:25] something that's going to take away
[38:27] their reproach amen
[38:29] actually so glad that the very head of
[38:32] the corner has come to you to take away
[38:34] your reproach amen and that you are in
[38:37] the category that is falling upon that
[38:39] stone amen
[38:41] you're in that category now now what
[38:44] you'll find and this is what we will all
[38:46] find in our life is that and we're going
[38:48] to get into it a bit later in the story
[38:50] of Nehemiah as we you we've come out of
[38:55] Babylon we've come out of a cage of
[38:57] hateful birds every unclean thing come
[39:01] out of it and we've been showing an
[39:03] epistolary age we've been showing the
[39:05] message which is Jesus Christ which ties
[39:08] us back to the origin or the beginning
[39:10] the reality would be showing those
[39:14] things for a permanence let's carry on
[39:19] now we want to go I want to talk about
[39:24] this is that this is a very strong quote
[39:27] so just don't read it yet please
[39:35] so just how do i black that out of it
[39:37] here we go I want to just read this
[39:41] before we go on in essence this because
[39:44] you see you've got to lay your life down
[39:47] upon that rock it's a rock of truth and
[39:52] confessing you believe it the truth
[39:54] itself will become Rock and your current
[39:57] lifestyle will be broken by the truth
[40:00] and wrong God will give you he's got
[40:05] those stones that they're lying in your
[40:06] life because the word is in you already
[40:08] and so as you walk with him he's going
[40:11] to reveal things to you he's going to
[40:13] show you things and he's going to ask
[40:15] you fall on this he's going to ask you
[40:17] let your lip because this is a certain
[40:19] revelation that you have to fall upon it
[40:21] to allow him to break that old lifestyle
[40:24] or whatever that thing was that you were
[40:26] doing whatever that mentality was that
[40:29] complex was whatever that attribute was
[40:32] you need to fall upon there because that
[40:36] rock is going to break that current
[40:37] lifestyle and the rock itself will
[40:40] become your actual lifestyle because
[40:42] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[40:44] it's actually going to build up your
[40:46] life and it's going to continue to build
[40:48] you up like in the story of Nehemiah
[40:51] until all the wolves are built amen and
[40:55] you actually see later on those stones
[40:58] that built that wall were lying and
[41:00] rubbish did you know that and the stones
[41:04] that are going to build your life I'm
[41:05] just going to say it now the stones that
[41:07] will build your life allowing in rubbish
[41:09] sometimes in your own life and your own
[41:11] vessel in your own subconscious the
[41:14] revelation that God's given you he's
[41:17] placed it right in your subconscious the
[41:19] stones the confessions the professions
[41:21] the things that's going to build the
[41:23] walls of your life and make you a
[41:24] wholesome person and make you the
[41:26] character of God a lying and rubbish
[41:28] sometimes in your life
[41:30] they're lying down there and you'll see
[41:32] it in the story of Nehemiah it's amazing
[41:37] every stone in our life must be tuned we
[41:40] cannot leave any stone unturned and
[41:43] we've got to stop confessing sandstones
[41:46] those stand stones that you think is
[41:50] your confessions that you say about
[41:52] yourself all the time and maybe we're
[41:54] getting better now we've been 10 parts
[41:56] now 9 parts but and over the our life as
[41:58] a Christian you get better it and you
[42:01] know confessing the right thing we've
[42:04] got to stop confessing sandstone and
[42:06] building our life on the sand a man will
[42:08] start confessing and doing amen amen
[42:10] letting our life confess the rock
[42:14] hallelujah and when that rock presents
[42:16] itself to fall upon it amen don't resist
[42:20] it stop resisting it don't resist it
[42:23] anymore it's no point of resisting it
[42:25] because you'll end up in in a trouble
[42:27] especially if you're a son you'll end up
[42:30] in the trouble because you can't go any
[42:33] further
[42:34] amen when I say son I mean daughter -
[42:36] you know synonymous yeah amen everything
[42:42] we think on and say needs to be sincere
[42:44] and aligned with our true origin who we
[42:48] really are
[42:48] amen and that's just another way of
[42:51] saying you need to confess from the
[42:53] Stone the rock the foundation of Christ
[42:55] which he's come and laid it with a knew
[42:58] already
[43:01] so please know just move on I mean this
[43:05] is all going to try to give it later on
[43:11] this is from the sermon the hour has
[43:15] come brother Branham says now the right
[43:18] mental attitude all you along here do
[43:23] you understand what I mean when I say
[43:25] the right mental attitude you're right
[43:27] mental mental attitude towards God's
[43:33] divine promise will bring any promise to
[43:36] pass this is a really amazing thing it's
[43:40] so simple and so elementary but it's so
[43:42] amazing that there is a real God places
[43:47] an importance upon this part as well
[43:51] then if this part can just hold to a
[43:53] testimony for long enough and stick the
[43:56] stand your guns or whatever the saying
[43:58] is stick to it eventually something's
[44:02] going to happen if you don't get swayed
[44:04] by your circumstances or by your
[44:06] symptoms or by all those things by all
[44:08] the temptations of the enemy stick to
[44:12] your testimony amen
[44:14] stick to it with all your heart with all
[44:17] your mind that sticking to it
[44:20] keep that mental attitude what is the
[44:22] mental attitude the Word of God is
[44:24] always true the promises of God are true
[44:26] amen God is faithful to his word and he
[44:30] will meet you your faith he will answer
[44:33] his word his promises according to your
[44:36] faith so we said to them when they
[44:38] approached them in the flesh as to by
[44:41] your faith be it unto you as per your
[44:44] faith be it unto you they held on they
[44:46] really wanted something and they just
[44:48] keep doing it and they touch the hem of
[44:50] His garment and they got what they
[44:51] needed leave it now maybe you don't
[44:54] believe that you say well my faith is
[44:56] weak now this is where that starts to
[44:58] really kind of bite I wouldn't confess
[45:02] it see don't let the devil know that
[45:05] what so the devil doesn't know what
[45:07] you're thinking no if you start
[45:10] confessing that your faith is weak
[45:12] you're going to let the devil in on a
[45:13] bad secret you don't want to let the
[45:15] devil in on that secret maybe you might
[45:18] have some problems down there or
[45:20] whatever may be going on or complexes
[45:22] that make you never confess
[45:23] don't let the devil in on those things
[45:25] and then you just keep confessing it
[45:27] because that isn't the real you
[45:29] that is a sandstone testimony there is a
[45:32] testimony that under pressure is going
[45:34] to crumble the sand and you don't want
[45:35] to build your life on that a man you
[45:38] don't want to build your life on sand
[45:39] amen so you need a I thought that was
[45:42] quite good
[45:43] well my faith is weak no I don't I
[45:45] wouldn't confess it see don't let the
[45:47] devil know that always say man that
[45:51] makes me feel good I've got good faith I
[45:54] believe God with all my heart
[45:56] amen I don't know the Prophet just
[45:58] understood something that Harvard and
[46:00] all those people are only just
[46:01] discovering now the Prophet understood
[46:03] that if you just keep testifying the
[46:05] positive and keeping your mind on what's
[46:07] positive and testifying that the devil
[46:09] is going to start getting unsure about
[46:11] you he's going to start being but shaky
[46:13] around you amen
[46:15] and there might in all reality there
[46:17] might be some frustrations and doubts
[46:18] going on but he doesn't need to know
[46:20] that amen because eventually it's all
[46:23] going to change because eventually
[46:24] what's up here is going to be trained
[46:26] down in those papers there and down in
[46:28] your subconscious and you're going to
[46:30] have perfect v amen and whatever you say
[46:33] now remember as we've said God is
[46:35] reserving those things as time unfolds
[46:37] and as you become mature he will entrust
[46:39] you with the power to just speak in
[46:41] anything happen but you see we've got to
[46:43] have the character we're going to have
[46:44] the maturity I'm on my journey man I've
[46:47] got a long way to go but Amen I'm sure
[46:50] we all got a long way to go you know
[46:52] hallelujah and you see that's just part
[46:55] of the journey but we still we don't
[46:58] want to confess or speak the devil's
[47:00] language because as soon as we do that
[47:03] you just man you'll just open yourself
[47:05] up and you go all right yes he doesn't
[47:07] really believe or now look and they're
[47:09] really now you see you can't really
[47:12] Bluff them either you can't Bluff them
[47:14] you've got to you when you're testifying
[47:16] these things you've got to believe it
[47:18] that's not like oh you're trying to go
[47:21] against your own grain your mental
[47:23] attitude as I believe it now there might
[47:26] be some enemies in the land that's
[47:28] surrounding you and trying to configure
[47:30] it against you inside your subconscious
[47:32] trying to pull you down and do all those
[47:34] things because I'm old habit but that
[47:36] doesn't mean
[47:37] that's you right that doesn't mean that
[47:38] that's what your mental attitude is so
[47:40] you just hold your mental attitude
[47:42] strong firm and confess what the stone
[47:45] is said because those stones are lying
[47:48] down inside you those stones that are
[47:51] going to rebuild your walls
[47:53] mrs. Jerusalem I'll call you mrs.
[47:56] Jerusalem where the soul is where the
[47:59] temple is where the throne is where God
[48:00] comes to dwell as inside your soul so
[48:03] it's like furtively as Jerusalem and
[48:07] inside used the land you know you're the
[48:08] land Jerusalem is inside you in your
[48:11] heart amen and now all of that when you
[48:16] come you know every time that a little
[48:18] progress happens is going to be enemies
[48:20] that get angry because they don't want
[48:23] you to progress and there's going to be
[48:25] things that happen and all sorts of
[48:27] stuff that goes on to try and pull you
[48:29] down to try and distract you and get you
[48:31] focusing on something that's negative
[48:34] just stand your testimony never give up
[48:37] on your testimony never give up on your
[48:39] profession amen
[48:41] because he's the high priest of your
[48:42] profession I mean there's a supernatural
[48:44] element here I'm not trying to tell you
[48:46] positive thinking mental gymnastics
[48:48] tough I'm telling you that there is a
[48:50] supernatural backing hallelujah
[48:52] of backing towards your confession
[48:55] you're not just confessing 30 Amen
[48:56] you're confessing a supernatural God
[48:59] hallelujah that's living inside you amen
[49:02] so when you're confessing these things
[49:04] it's not like what the psychology world
[49:05] they're just empty and they might get
[49:08] results but they don't get our results
[49:10] amen
[49:11] because what we're confessing is the
[49:13] truth for one thing what we're
[49:14] confessing is part of an eternal God
[49:16] with eternal power to actually make the
[49:19] change possible and happen and so we've
[49:23] got good backing amen
[49:24] there's there's good funds in the bank
[49:27] hallelujah and you've got a checkbook
[49:29] with written in the blood of Jesus amen
[49:31] hallelujah we ain't going to get far
[49:33] down here I can do it so let's go
[49:36] it says here I've got good faith I
[49:38] believe God with all my heart see don't
[49:40] testify nothing of the devil
[49:42] when you accept them as your healer
[49:44] don't never act like you're sick or
[49:46] crippled anymore believe that you're
[49:48] healed
[49:49] take your Mathers word then it's all
[49:51] over on God then and not on you see now
[49:54] you need it this needs to be quicken to
[49:55] you these things start to get quite
[49:57] serious you can't just go out on a on a
[49:59] woman start doing things that are
[50:01] completely opposite it has to be quick
[50:05] until you have to be very serious about
[50:06] these things I want to just go
[50:08] willy-nilly and start doing these sort
[50:10] of things if you're on medication or you
[50:12] know you're doing something that's going
[50:13] to cause danger or cause change and this
[50:16] gods quicken that to you and this that's
[50:18] become a reality to you and this you're
[50:20] willing to fight it out and bear the
[50:22] reproach through thick and thin because
[50:24] there is a will be a reproach it will be
[50:26] a battle it will be a fight so then it
[50:28] you need to enter these metals ready
[50:32] ready
[50:34] amen brother Branham said to the people
[50:36] don't come into this prayer line if you
[50:37] don't believe you know there's no point
[50:40] you're coming because you're just going
[50:41] to go up and out in the Saints so you
[50:45] there is a balance to these things amen
[50:49] but at the same time the Prophet is been
[50:52] making a clear definition here and when
[50:55] this whole sort has been made a reality
[50:58] to you it's a very simple thing it's
[51:02] just holding sticking stand fast to your
[51:05] testimony to what God is showing you to
[51:07] the stones that are being lifted out of
[51:10] the rubbish of your life the rubbish
[51:13] that's been refused because you see when
[51:15] you came out of Babylon you were like
[51:19] you know Nehemiah the Kings copier and
[51:23] one day a burden came on your heart
[51:25] hallelujah something changed something
[51:27] shifted in your thinking and you look
[51:29] back and you saw the you the condition
[51:32] of your life you saw the walls that were
[51:34] all broken down and all the nostalgia
[51:38] came of a form of glory that what you
[51:42] could be restored back
[51:49] and all they will go into later
[51:53] let me just carry on for a second as
[51:55] long as you take God at His Word then
[51:57] the word will produce what it promised
[51:59] to you to do as long as you take God at
[52:02] His Word though workers then the word
[52:05] will produce what did promise to you to
[52:08] do is that right well his word returned
[52:12] boy no so if he gives you a word if he
[52:16] takes a stone and he brings it out to
[52:20] you and says fall on this let this
[52:23] become you this is your promise this is
[52:26] my promise to you take him at his word
[52:28] and never let that testimony wither
[52:31] never change that testimony no matter
[52:34] what sand ballots come to you okay
[52:36] Sanballat was the resistance to Nehemiah
[52:38] and we'll talk about them later
[52:40] never let it the - no matter what
[52:45] opposition comes hold to that testimony
[52:47] and the fact that you're getting
[52:49] opposition is a very good singer Amen
[52:52] from within and from without that
[52:55] resistance is a very good sign that what
[52:58] you're testifying what your life is
[53:00] saying is actually good and you're
[53:02] holding to something real with substance
[53:05] hallelujah now Jesus here was speaking
[53:07] he said father the time has come and
[53:10] this is where he brings the belt here he
[53:12] goes now they're seasons for everything
[53:14] do you believe that you've so in a
[53:15] certain season and you reap in a certain
[53:17] season and there's seasons when the time
[53:19] comes
[53:20] that's right for things to happen do you
[53:23] believe that and the servants called the
[53:25] hour has come so I think it's time amen
[53:27] the hour has come we're at the fullness
[53:29] of time there's been a great sowing
[53:32] coming into this bride coming into our
[53:35] lives he's actually sowing the head of
[53:39] the corner he's sewing the rock of our
[53:42] salvation
[53:43] he's Solon the very lord himself so if
[53:48] he's sowing into Sion into the bride
[53:51] into you if he's sewing into you himself
[53:54] not just the restoration of the gifts
[53:57] not just sanctification not just
[53:58] justification not just these bits and
[54:00] bobs
[54:01] but the fullness
[54:03] that you have access to every single
[54:05] thing and everything that you confess
[54:07] that's in that word is your inheritance
[54:10] amen and so if there's something God's
[54:13] placed on your heart like I preached
[54:15] earlier what you're failing whatever
[54:18] you'll fail that lately just work
[54:20] through that don't search everything in
[54:24] your life or and you get overwhelmed by
[54:26] all of the stuff that needs to go on and
[54:27] happen let God do that choosing that God
[54:30] actually bring up what needs to be
[54:32] brought up at the season that needs to
[54:34] be brought up so that he can deal with
[54:35] that
[54:36] between you and honey amen and stick
[54:39] with it until it's finished
[54:40] don't move on the devil will try and
[54:43] make you move on just before you get
[54:45] deliverance just before you get the
[54:47] victory he will put other problems in
[54:49] your life and you make you fail there no
[54:51] just wait God might be dealing with that
[54:53] thing and don't just turn from a
[54:55] whole deal with another time I'll go to
[54:57] the altar another time whatever however
[54:59] God deals with you how he speaks with
[55:01] you
[55:02] let it be dealt with amen don't you know
[55:05] and we all do that I'm sure I do it
[55:07] anyway as you know the laws dealing with
[55:10] something and then the next thing comes
[55:12] up and you sort of put that aside and
[55:14] then you start to get things going on
[55:16] that and God starts at the author so you
[55:18] get victory there and then another thing
[55:21] comes up and distractions and busyness
[55:22] and whatever I know it sounds easier
[55:25] said than done because we are in a
[55:27] battle and the enemy's been doing for
[55:28] 6,000 years but if we can just stay
[55:31] close to the captain if we can stay
[55:33] close to the rock and fall on him and
[55:35] rely on him amen the battle belongs to
[55:39] the law the seasons and his program
[55:42] belongs to him he will give us the
[55:44] discernment he will give us the vision
[55:47] and the wisdom because rovenland
[55:51] when I'll say it now the revelation that
[55:54] you get like a stone a rock of
[55:57] Revelation and it builds and it builds
[55:59] and you get more in a bill stone upon
[56:01] stone and it's actually creating the
[56:04] vision for your life it's giving you
[56:06] spiritual vision it's allowing you to
[56:09] see the ministry preach then and there
[56:12] and the testimony that's happening in
[56:14] the Fellowship is all bringing
[56:16] vision to you so that you can see things
[56:19] for what they really are so that you can
[56:23] see with spiritual eyes and not just see
[56:27] with your own intellect or understanding
[56:29] but revelation upon revelation brings
[56:31] vision stone upon stone is going to
[56:34] rebuild your life and you're going to
[56:36] become a city that is built with walls
[56:38] amen
[56:40] but with proper defenses that the devil
[56:43] can't touch bearing the reproach who
[56:51] remembers the story of John Ryan brother
[56:53] branham tells the story many times
[56:55] because here's a man that received a
[56:58] healing from God and God spoke to this
[57:01] man and it didn't just happen straight
[57:03] away and he didn't understand and so God
[57:05] he came back in the prayer line and
[57:07] there the Prophet said I thought you
[57:10] believed I do believe brother Brennan
[57:13] but it hasn't happened
[57:14] he said just go and testify now this man
[57:17] was ridiculed and laughed at but he had
[57:20] been given the word from the Lord and so
[57:22] he held to that word and regardless of
[57:25] the reproach and the embarrassment and
[57:26] Wow how people thought he was crazy the
[57:28] whole town was probably thought this man
[57:30] has gone off the nuts amen this then
[57:33] this man's gone down with those Holy
[57:35] Roller nuts and he's become a nut case
[57:37] and it was all this big thing
[57:40] extra extra praise the Lord for healing
[57:43] me Amen that man hallelujah he bore the
[57:46] reproach and you know what God's and let
[57:52] it come out sometimes the medicine that
[57:55] you need and your healing is going to
[57:56] take a reproach and that's up to the
[57:59] Lord and so you might have to go through
[58:01] a John Ryan experience sometimes to get
[58:03] a healing Amen
[58:04] God might promise you and you might come
[58:06] up here and the word might come over
[58:07] your life and you might get healed and
[58:09] then all of us and the manifestation
[58:12] hasn't happened but maybe God wants you
[58:15] to bear some reproach for it he wants
[58:17] you to testify what your faith is seeing
[58:20] and not what your eyes are seen not what
[58:23] your body is feeling not what the doctor
[58:26] is saying about what faith is saying
[58:28] what faith is see
[58:30] because faith is the true vision best
[58:33] time to look at the promises Amen and
[58:35] that leads us on to Abraham who embraced
[58:38] the promises amen and I believe that we
[58:41] are a people that are embracing the
[58:44] promises of God hallelujah
[58:46] what are some embraces to grab hold of
[58:48] and Linnet just become dear to you and
[58:50] have a hope a man that sounds bad but
[58:53] it's a hope a real hope a godly Hope
[58:55] which is an anticipation Amen so when
[58:58] something's promise to you hallelujah
[59:01] when something's promise to you and
[59:03] before it actually becomes a reality in
[59:06] your life there is always a period where
[59:10] there is hope which is actually because
[59:13] faith now is the substance of what you
[59:16] hope for so there's a period where
[59:19] you've got a hook for something is
[59:20] appear where you look or something
[59:22] quickens to you and you're like all yes
[59:24] that's mine I'm going to have that I
[59:27] want that and now you've got an
[59:30] anticipation and it's a pleasurable in
[59:33] census and page because you're craving
[59:35] after that you want that you're you're
[59:37] drawing from the wells of salvation
[59:41] rejoicing amen while you're embracing
[59:43] the promises amen
[59:45] while you're carrying yourself embracing
[59:48] that promise
[59:49] hoping until one day Amen God turns that
[59:52] hope into substance and that becomes
[59:54] faith hallelujah and then you really got
[59:57] it then amen and then it all just sinks
[1:00:00] down and whatever needs to happen
[1:00:02] happens Alleluia
[1:00:04] but we must that we need to embrace
[1:00:06] those promises of God we need to let all
[1:00:08] of them laugh with this sense it's life
[1:00:12] or death this is like you we cannot just
[1:00:16] be willing nilly about it or we cannot
[1:00:17] just be blase about it this is a battle
[1:00:21] this is a fighting the good fight of
[1:00:22] faith fighting the good fight of faith
[1:00:25] and it's all planned for you
[1:00:27] Amen God knows just how to deal with you
[1:00:30] he knows that we're born in a microwave
[1:00:33] generation that's always used to getting
[1:00:35] everything straight away and so you know
[1:00:37] and it comes in the disguise of you know
[1:00:40] all we are the bride of Jesus cry
[1:00:43] then you know we're coming into perfect
[1:00:45] faith and and we're almost ready for the
[1:00:47] rapture so we should get everything by
[1:00:49] an instantaneous miracle but you see now
[1:00:52] God is actually more wise than just to
[1:00:55] give us everything instantaneously
[1:00:57] because there's still things in our life
[1:00:59] that need to be dealt with they're still
[1:01:01] and so therefore he will administer his
[1:01:04] healing in many different ways the
[1:01:06] manifold grace of God amen and so
[1:01:09] sometimes as I've said you need to go
[1:01:11] through the reproach sometimes you need
[1:01:13] to go through hope and you need to wait
[1:01:16] and and and call those things that are
[1:01:18] not as though they were amen Abraham
[1:01:21] embraced the promises of God for 25
[1:01:23] years
[1:01:24] amen and he had a burden on his heart to
[1:01:27] bring forth a son amen to bring forth a
[1:01:30] life that was going to take on the
[1:01:32] inheritance amen hallelujah so he had to
[1:01:35] embrace those promises for a very long
[1:01:37] time and God wanted him to do that
[1:01:39] hallelujah because that would bring
[1:01:41] encouragement to us because sometimes
[1:01:43] we're going to wait a long time for
[1:01:45] things but that doesn't mean we're
[1:01:47] lacking in faith never confess that
[1:01:49] that's a sandstone testimony amen and
[1:01:52] under pressure that will crumble but a
[1:01:55] true testimony is yes it's mine God
[1:01:57] promised that I believe it and that's it
[1:02:00] the Word of God is always true it's
[1:02:02] always pure he is faithful I he would
[1:02:05] above all things that I prosper and be
[1:02:07] in health amen
[1:02:09] what above all things that I prosper and
[1:02:11] be in health hallelujah
[1:02:13] Nehemiah now we're just going to get
[1:02:16] into the very crux of the sermon here
[1:02:20] rebuilding the stone walls of the broken
[1:02:22] city you see near Meyer one day he was
[1:02:28] just doing this thing
[1:02:29] he was the king's cup bearer you know so
[1:02:32] I think you know that's kind of like us
[1:02:34] a little bit we build a cup of the King
[1:02:36] amen hallelujah we drink from the king's
[1:02:40] cup hallelujah amen and there's many
[1:02:43] great things in that cup their cup was
[1:02:45] poured out for us
[1:02:46] hallelujah so we partake of the king's
[1:02:48] cup but this man here the king's cup
[1:02:50] bearer in the presence of the king and
[1:02:52] one day a burden comes on his heart and
[1:02:56] he looks back and he
[1:02:57] seize this torn down place and he
[1:03:01] becomes burdened and he starts getting a
[1:03:05] real burden to see this Jerusalem being
[1:03:07] rebuilt hallelujah and I believe that
[1:03:10] God is placing giving us a similar
[1:03:13] burden to see what was one once upon a
[1:03:19] time and thrown by David and enthroned
[1:03:22] by Solomon and great kings and great
[1:03:24] things happen in the God of heaven dwelt
[1:03:27] Ernest and the Shekinah glory and and
[1:03:29] and then the neighborhood was a presence
[1:03:32] of God hallelujah was was it was awash
[1:03:35] with the glory of God and their
[1:03:38] victories and all those things and they
[1:03:39] must have been going to his mind he must
[1:03:42] have been thinking on those things above
[1:03:44] hallelujah amen and God started to
[1:03:47] reveal to him and show him and started
[1:03:50] to quicken to him then he's going to be
[1:03:53] he's part of a vision it's going to open
[1:03:56] up that's going to see lives rebuilt
[1:04:00] it's going to see what was glorious that
[1:04:04] was torn down be restored again
[1:04:07] hallelujah and we're in a similar
[1:04:09] position Saints where what was glorious
[1:04:13] under the Apostolic age under Paul and
[1:04:15] under the Apostles the foundation of our
[1:04:18] faith amen what was glorious there it
[1:04:22] got all torn down once upon a time it
[1:04:25] all went into the dark age and the
[1:04:26] church went into Babylon it's the same
[1:04:29] repeat of history Saints history has
[1:04:32] repeated itself and now we've been
[1:04:36] raised up and we've been drinking from
[1:04:39] the golden rooms of the King's Cup
[1:04:41] hallelujah
[1:04:42] but you know it's actually time that all
[1:04:46] of the things in our life need to be
[1:04:50] restored all of the walls of our life
[1:04:54] that make the defenses and bring us into
[1:04:57] our perfect order need to be restored
[1:05:01] and I say to you leave no stone unturned
[1:05:10] he that has no rule over his own spirit
[1:05:13] it's like a city that has broken down
[1:05:15] and built without them without wolf and
[1:05:19] so I'm tying that together you see what
[1:05:24] God is doing as he's going to make you a
[1:05:27] city Jerusalem hello Jerusalem hello
[1:05:31] bride Holy City being rebuilt holy
[1:05:35] priesthood temple of living stones
[1:05:38] amen he's going to make you a city that
[1:05:43] is fixed with wolves amen hallelujah
[1:05:50] he's going to restore you completely now
[1:05:59] but what does that mean you know on a
[1:06:02] practical that is he's going to give you
[1:06:05] dominion over your spirit he wants to
[1:06:08] give you control over those things
[1:06:10] because he wants to see a true
[1:06:12] leadership forming in your life he wants
[1:06:14] to see that you can lead your own spirit
[1:06:17] you can actually get control of your own
[1:06:20] spirit and and and discern all the
[1:06:23] things that's got incoming and outgoing
[1:06:25] you know inwards and outwards goods and
[1:06:27] actually have a clear de sermon on that
[1:06:29] so that there can be a true leadership
[1:06:31] in your life because he's preparing you
[1:06:33] because you're coming to it you're not
[1:06:36] just a betrothal you're not just a
[1:06:39] fiancee you're not just a wife you're
[1:06:44] not just the co-heir you'll come into
[1:06:46] something you're actually being trained
[1:06:49] you're being brought up because he's
[1:06:51] going to make you ruler over many cities
[1:06:52] and so right now is your trying time
[1:06:56] right now he's preparing you for
[1:06:59] queenship because you're going to be
[1:07:02] queen of heaven amen
[1:07:04] right through that millennial reign and
[1:07:06] probably for eternity Queen and so there
[1:07:12] is an actual leadership that needs to
[1:07:13] come out of your life and so yeah it
[1:07:15] gives you something to rule over and
[1:07:16] that's your spirit now how are you going
[1:07:19] to rule that spirit Saints what are you
[1:07:21] going to lead into those eyes so
[1:07:23] for what you linen is going to become a
[1:07:25] big problem in your life if it's wrong
[1:07:27] hmmm because that that flesh man will
[1:07:30] attach attach to anything that's evil
[1:07:33] like like you wouldn't believe
[1:07:35] real quick and those things need to be
[1:07:38] dealt with real good and how are you
[1:07:42] going to rule it since you're going to
[1:07:44] rule it with a malevolence legalism make
[1:07:49] yourself through this conform to
[1:07:51] something or by a true benevolence of
[1:07:55] leadership and love so that your spirit
[1:07:59] and your body enjoys living and actually
[1:08:02] enjoys and it can actually be balanced
[1:08:04] and express emotion and you know and BMB
[1:08:07] freedom truly free so near Maya to
[1:08:14] eleven to fifteen says so I came to
[1:08:17] Jerusalem and was there three days and I
[1:08:22] arose in the night I and some few men
[1:08:25] with me neither told I any man what my
[1:08:27] God had put into my heart to do it
[1:08:30] Jerusalem neither was there any beast
[1:08:32] with me save the Beast that I rode upon
[1:08:37] and I went out by night now take note of
[1:08:42] these places five different points that
[1:08:45] he stops at then surveying the damage so
[1:08:49] there is a this is just a confirmation
[1:08:53] of what I was speaking on I think last
[1:08:55] week last time by the gate of the valley
[1:08:59] even before the dragon well and to the
[1:09:02] done Paul and I viewed the walls of
[1:09:05] Jerusalem which were broken down and the
[1:09:09] gates thereof were consumed with fire
[1:09:10] then I went on to the gate of the
[1:09:12] fountain and to the Kings pool but there
[1:09:16] was no place for the beast that was
[1:09:17] under me to pass so then I went up in
[1:09:20] the night by the brook there was the
[1:09:21] brook Kedron
[1:09:22] and viewed the wall and turned back and
[1:09:25] entered by the gate of the belly and so
[1:09:27] returned you see there is a there is
[1:09:30] meaning and all of these words here
[1:09:33] he went out by night and entered in by
[1:09:35] the gate of the valley
[1:09:37] and this is actually where when you
[1:09:40] enter into survey these things it comes
[1:09:42] down into a valley of your life where
[1:09:44] you're going through something hard and
[1:09:45] there is a there there is trouble and
[1:09:48] you come down into a valley and
[1:09:50] sometimes you you're going to face now
[1:09:54] the din of a dragon the den of some
[1:09:57] demon that's affected you
[1:09:59] that's hurt you or is hurting you
[1:10:01] depending on where you've been and
[1:10:03] what's happened and if you've been
[1:10:05] delivered
[1:10:06] but you'll you'll stumble across these
[1:10:08] things in your view when you're viewing
[1:10:10] the damage when you're viewing the walls
[1:10:13] that have been broken down because you
[1:10:16] see we cannot remain in a state of
[1:10:17] broken wolves you cannot remain that way
[1:10:22] it is not God's will for us to be a
[1:10:25] broken down city that's tossed to and
[1:10:28] fro by every wind of doctrine tossed out
[1:10:31] by thoughts of your spirit that's
[1:10:33] allowing you to think stuff that you
[1:10:34] shouldn't think infections and vile
[1:10:38] affections and all those things that the
[1:10:40] Spirit will your spirit will try and
[1:10:42] think of you allow it if it's ruling you
[1:10:45] it's going to cause you lots of trouble
[1:10:47] and so now near my earners surveying of
[1:10:52] the damage comes to the done pork and
[1:10:57] this done port is actually the gate of
[1:11:00] where they all the rubbish dump of
[1:11:02] Jerusalem basically in G Jesus actually
[1:11:04] likened us to Hellfire tahina because it
[1:11:07] was burning there booth in rubbish and
[1:11:09] so you see now this is now coming down
[1:11:11] and looking at all of the rubbish
[1:11:13] because it was apparently overflowing
[1:11:15] and there was rubbish everywhere and the
[1:11:18] walls were all broken now there was so
[1:11:19] much rubbish that he couldn't his beasts
[1:11:21] couldn't go any further at the walk you
[1:11:23] know this was this is what the histories
[1:11:27] say now that I don't know where the next
[1:11:29] biblical or not but it seems pretty good
[1:11:32] because I'm sure it would have been
[1:11:34] because there was no more order to the
[1:11:35] city because the city was broken down it
[1:11:38] wasn't functioning there was no Kingdom
[1:11:40] net city but when the King comes back to
[1:11:43] the city thinks that changing hey men
[1:11:45] hallelujah hallelujah but you see now as
[1:11:50] he views
[1:11:51] and he sees all this rubbish piling up
[1:11:55] it must have saddened him and he viewed
[1:11:58] the walls of Jerusalem which were broken
[1:11:59] down and the gates there I was consumed
[1:12:01] then I went on to the gate at the
[1:12:03] fountain fountain
[1:12:14] that word fountain means outward
[1:12:16] appearance start looking at the outward
[1:12:19] appearance and what your life appears to
[1:12:22] be as your life worthy of the gospel is
[1:12:26] that reflecting the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:12:29] that reflecting the image of Christ and
[1:12:32] the message of the hour that's been
[1:12:34] revealed to us what is the outward
[1:12:36] appearance as you come and assess the
[1:12:40] walls of your city as you assess what's
[1:12:43] going on because you see it's not that's
[1:12:47] not the will for this age to live in
[1:12:49] that condition many ages have gone by
[1:12:51] many generations in the church where
[1:12:54] that's passed by and the people have
[1:12:55] remained but this is an age where that
[1:12:58] does not remain this is an age where
[1:13:01] that City is being completely rebuilt
[1:13:02] and you are that City you are that
[1:13:05] Jerusalem that is being completely
[1:13:07] restored and the King has descended into
[1:13:09] your city to rebuild you to rebuild your
[1:13:13] walls he went round here he entered in
[1:13:22] here at the Valley Gate and he will ride
[1:13:26] around here past the pool of Siloam the
[1:13:29] Kings pool
[1:13:31] and you see the dung gate down here was
[1:13:36] full of rubbish and as beasts couldn't
[1:13:41] get any further here and then he walked
[1:13:44] up to the fountain gate here we passed
[1:13:48] the Kings pool which is the pool of
[1:13:50] Siloam and then he walked back up here
[1:13:52] and then he went back out this is up the
[1:13:55] cardroom
[1:13:56] card Rhone Valley here and up to this
[1:13:59] Brook here I've actually been here go to
[1:14:03] the next one this one's a bit clearer so
[1:14:07] went up here and down here the pool of
[1:14:09] Siloam and this little tunnel here is
[1:14:12] actually here's a Kies aqueduct then I
[1:14:15] actually went through there it's pretty
[1:14:16] cool really cool but anyway he walked
[1:14:22] through here to assess what was going on
[1:14:25] to assess by night
[1:14:28] my secret to prepare and this is the
[1:14:34] thing that we need to do in our own
[1:14:35] lives we need to prepare for the battle
[1:14:41] we need to know what the Lord is
[1:14:44] actually dealing with and when we come
[1:14:47] into a valley and we discover that
[1:14:52] there's things going on this is the age
[1:14:55] that it will be dealt with this is the
[1:14:58] time that it will be dealt with this is
[1:15:01] the prerogative this is the program the
[1:15:03] plan of God to deal with those things to
[1:15:07] deal with the dragons so to speak that
[1:15:10] are laying down there that you can only
[1:15:13] discover when you're in the valley and
[1:15:16] to see all the rubbish that's been piled
[1:15:18] up because you see that rubbish that's
[1:15:21] been piled up is covering over the rocks
[1:15:23] of the walls that need to be rebuilt and
[1:15:26] there's rubbish in our lives that you
[1:15:29] know and maybe not all of us we're all
[1:15:31] in different places of course and some
[1:15:33] piles of rubbish are bigger than others
[1:15:34] it depends on how you what you've done
[1:15:37] with the Word of God how you've been
[1:15:39] dealt with how you're fallen on the rock
[1:15:41] or whether you're one of those people
[1:15:43] that resists it all the time and spake
[1:15:45] take ages and ages for to do anything
[1:15:49] and the Lord has to crush you down or
[1:15:53] whether when the revelation comes when
[1:15:55] the rock is presented by grace and you
[1:15:59] fall on that rock
[1:16:01] you know season the psalm 119 I hasten
[1:16:04] to keep like a man that took God you
[1:16:06] come to a place in your life where
[1:16:08] whatever in Lord O Lord if you could
[1:16:12] just show me anything that you were
[1:16:15] grieved was in my life I don't want
[1:16:17] nothing to come between me and him amen
[1:16:20] nothing at all and if something is
[1:16:24] between me and them and I don't know
[1:16:25] about it Lord show me if there's a
[1:16:28] complex in my life and this complex is
[1:16:30] in my life and I don't know you know if
[1:16:32] I knew where they came from I'll be
[1:16:33] dealing with them and I'm asking the
[1:16:35] Lord where does this come from why do I
[1:16:38] do this cuz it's frustrating me and for
[1:16:41] us
[1:16:41] ready for others but this is the this is
[1:16:46] our here it is to be free from all those
[1:16:48] things amen brother Branham says on
[1:16:54] outside this is the Bible you see the
[1:16:57] trouble we are in how Jerusalem lies in
[1:17:00] ruins with its gates Boone come let us
[1:17:05] build the wall of Jerusalem that we may
[1:17:07] no longer suffer reproach this is nearby
[1:17:10] now encouraging the people and may this
[1:17:13] be an encouragement to you and I told
[1:17:16] them of the hand of my God that had been
[1:17:18] upon me for good and also of the words
[1:17:21] that the King had spoken to me and they
[1:17:23] said let us rise up and build so they
[1:17:26] strengthen their hand for the good work
[1:17:28] but when send ballots the annoyed
[1:17:31] and to Baia the ammonite servant of
[1:17:33] geese in the Arab heard of it they
[1:17:34] jeered at us
[1:17:36] and despised us and said what does this
[1:17:39] thing that you're doing are you
[1:17:42] rebelling against the king then I
[1:17:45] replied to them the God of heaven will
[1:17:47] make us prosper ever see in the face of
[1:17:50] all the enemy in the face of whatever he
[1:17:52] said if that vision opens to you and
[1:17:55] this is our vision our walls are being
[1:17:58] rebuilt and maybe it's the last gate I
[1:18:00] don't know you know God knows you'll
[1:18:04] know how far to a degree where your
[1:18:10] walls are at what party or walls is he
[1:18:13] working on what stones are getting
[1:18:16] pulled out of the the heaps down below
[1:18:19] the sand is getting cast off amen all
[1:18:23] those confessions that are false and all
[1:18:24] those things that you've said about
[1:18:25] yourself that are wrong they're all
[1:18:28] being cast off you know we're being
[1:18:30] equipped now this is what's happening
[1:18:34] Saints this has been happening over the
[1:18:37] last nine parts the walls are being
[1:18:40] rebuilt your confessions are being
[1:18:41] corrected the sand stones of your life
[1:18:45] are being crushed down under the
[1:18:47] pressure of the Word of God so that you
[1:18:49] can recognize that what stance though
[1:18:51] and now confessing the truth confessing
[1:18:54] the word rebuilding those walls amen be
[1:18:59] encouraged Saints don't lose the vision
[1:19:02] continue in your testimony regardless of
[1:19:06] all the enemies and all the same ballots
[1:19:07] had come and we'll go into that name
[1:19:09] sembalun soon it's very interesting he
[1:19:12] says here Nehemiah the God of heaven
[1:19:14] will make us prosper he says thus
[1:19:16] directly in this in the face of Satan
[1:19:18] the God of heaven will make us prosper
[1:19:21] no weapon that is formed against you
[1:19:23] shall prosper but you will prosper
[1:19:25] because he would above all things that
[1:19:28] you prosper and be in health
[1:19:29] what above all things heavy and we his
[1:19:34] servants will arise and build a men were
[1:19:38] who's building you the master builder
[1:19:40] he's building you amen
[1:19:42] hallelujah and we his servants will
[1:19:45] arise and build but you Satan have no
[1:19:48] portion or right or claim in Jerusalem
[1:19:51] and amen
[1:19:53] why don't we talk about the title deed
[1:19:55] that his claim has been what hallelujah

[1:20:47] wrong now I don't mean like it should be
[1:20:50] easy I mean it's the grace of God will
[1:20:52] keep you but if you're not going through
[1:20:54] a struggle the Prophet said this life is
[1:20:56] a struggle if you're not struggling
[1:20:59] through things by the grace of God of
[1:21:01] course not in your own strength then it
[1:21:03] be this
[1:21:05] no progress without it because God's
[1:21:08] putting you through stuff amen
[1:21:10] maybe you're just you're ignoring the
[1:21:12] problems in your life you've seen the
[1:21:15] walls of your life and you know that
[1:21:16] there's a bricks there and you know that
[1:21:18] there's a bricks there and you know that
[1:21:19] this is there but they're you thinking
[1:21:20] you're my heart's too hard I don't want
[1:21:22] to deal with those things now it might
[1:21:24] embarrass me in front of the others Amen
[1:21:27] I don't want to confess them before my
[1:21:28] brothers and sisters but you can because
[1:21:31] you see we're all in the same boat
[1:21:33] Alleluia we're all in this together
[1:21:35] we're all humans amen

[1:21:40] Babylonian place and we've been given an
[1:21:42] edict okay be king go and rebuild
[1:21:46] hallelujah and so now under the power
[1:21:49] and authority of the king we're being
[1:21:51] called to rebuild amen
[1:21:53] but that rebuilding is going to be a
[1:21:55] battle all the way and as it gets more
[1:21:58] and more the battles get worse and worse
[1:22:00] amen hallelujah but hallelujah
[1:22:04] regardless of all the battles and all
[1:22:06] the sanballat pressure hold to your
[1:22:09] testimony regardless of your
[1:22:11] circumstances regardless of your
[1:22:12] symptoms hold to your testimony hold to
[1:22:16] your confession not just with this that
[1:22:19] was your life let your life fall on the
[1:22:22] rock and let whatever that rock is
[1:22:24] become what your life produces because
[1:22:28] that's the purpose of the rock is that
[1:22:29] you fall on it
[1:22:30] amen that revelation will then become
[1:22:33] flesh hallelujah it'll break down the
[1:22:36] things that there's been problematic to
[1:22:38] you hallelujah
[1:22:41] Satan you have no right or claim in
[1:22:43] Jerusalem
[1:22:44] Satan you have no right or claim over my
[1:22:46] soul hallelujah over my inheritance
[1:22:50] because you see the king issued the
[1:22:54] Edict they made hallelujah the King
[1:22:58] issued it
[1:22:59] Amen it's got the whole power of King
[1:23:02] the king behind it mm-hm so nothing
[1:23:04] Sanballat could do amen I like that so
[1:23:09] much it makes me so happy to know that
[1:23:14] he near Maya for one to two this is but
[1:23:18] it came to pass that when sanballat hold
[1:23:21] on it forgives me I just want to just
[1:23:24] talk about I just want to show you there
[1:23:30] it is
[1:23:37] I must have deleted oh no here does the
[1:23:39] name Sanballat and it took a while to
[1:23:41] find this because it's not in the in the
[1:23:43] concordance it's actually in the book
[1:23:45] I've got about names and it says the
[1:23:48] name of Sanballat means sin save the
[1:23:51] life and I said Lord what does that mean
[1:23:55] sin save the life where does this fit in
[1:23:59] because everything but since the Word of
[1:24:00] God member everything fits guys telling
[1:24:03] you a story he's revealing you yourself
[1:24:06] and your situation and your vision in
[1:24:08] the word and it has to mean something
[1:24:10] and then the full he that saves his life
[1:24:13] shall lose it and he that loses life for
[1:24:16] my sake shall gain it so what does it
[1:24:19] profit you of you get all the things of
[1:24:22] this world and lose your own soul so
[1:24:24] what is the sin bellick come to try and
[1:24:26] offer you he wants you to keep your life
[1:24:29] he wants you to keep your will and your
[1:24:31] intentions in your motives and your
[1:24:33] objectives and your dreams and what you
[1:24:36] think is right for your family and your
[1:24:37] children Sanballat will come to you at
[1:24:40] all these different crafty ways and
[1:24:42] you'll get into your reasoning in your
[1:24:43] conscience you get into your spirit and
[1:24:46] you'll twist things around and then all
[1:24:48] of a sudden you think it's a good
[1:24:49] decision that I made that and really you
[1:24:51] keep your life amen
[1:24:54] you kept your life that's the temptation
[1:24:56] that sam bella keep firin it nehemiah
[1:24:59] and you see that same temptation comes
[1:25:03] to us are you going to surrender your
[1:25:06] life or are you going to give it to the
[1:25:09] Lord and continue in the vision
[1:25:12] regardless all the reasonings and all of
[1:25:15] that stuff question it as this part of
[1:25:18] the program where are we act oh man
[1:25:20] we're knocking on the wretches door
[1:25:21] hallelujah amen there's no time to waste
[1:25:25] hallelujah and so you see now we're
[1:25:27] going to save our life where we're going
[1:25:28] to lose it or we're going to lose our
[1:25:29] life and save it
[1:25:30] hey man that's the temptation and so the
[1:25:33] same bellick pressure would come on
[1:25:35] hallelujah amen it's character plays the
[1:25:40] part of the temptation we face to give
[1:25:41] up on the vision of being rebuilt and to
[1:25:45] save our life here but as Jesus said we
[1:25:50] will lose our
[1:25:50] all if we fail to lose our own life here
[1:25:53] and take up our cross the rebuilding of
[1:25:57] the walls is linked to a complete death
[1:26:00] to self and surrender to the open
[1:26:04] version that's coming from the stone
[1:26:08] laid in soil the stone lead and Sion is
[1:26:16] Laden all of you and he is opened a
[1:26:21] vision for our church for our age for
[1:26:25] our generation as a program and he's
[1:26:29] given it and it's coming from within you
[1:26:31] and it's coming out now for you to see
[1:26:34] that for you to experience that in to
[1:26:37] walk in that you need a fall on that
[1:26:39] stone and stone by stone revelation by
[1:26:43] revelation it will become clearer to you
[1:26:45] but if you if you resist that and you
[1:26:48] just keep walking when that stone is
[1:26:50] laying there for you to fall on and a
[1:26:52] light upon out of your flight sometimes
[1:26:54] you need a full light fail you know fall
[1:26:58] down fail and fall on that rock don't
[1:27:01] fall on your own reasoning and try and
[1:27:02] reason in a way that was everyone else's
[1:27:04] fault not yours because actually it was
[1:27:06] your fault
[1:27:07] amen amen even when it wasn't you just
[1:27:11] own up hallelujah always look to
[1:27:13] yourself first before you look at others
[1:27:16] amen did I have a right how could I have
[1:27:19] avoided that better I'm a son of God I
[1:27:22] can create an atmosphere Amen my prayer
[1:27:25] changes things hallelujah could have
[1:27:27] preempted those things you know and I
[1:27:28] think we're all grown amen I believe we
[1:27:31] are all growing I don't just think that
[1:27:32] we are growing amen and so here I'm
[1:27:36] going to read you the devil's question
[1:27:38] hold on he is rebuilding us stone by
[1:27:41] stone as we completely surrender to his
[1:27:44] will his vision opens as we bear the
[1:27:50] King's Cup and enter into communion that
[1:27:53] edict continues to sound and that vision
[1:27:56] for a rebuild a total rebuild a total

[1:28:59] great indignation and mocked the Jews
[1:29:01] and he speak before his brethren and the
[1:29:04] army of Samaria and said what do these
[1:29:07] feeble Jews will they fortify themselves
[1:29:12] will they sacrifice will they make an
[1:29:16] end in a day

[1:32:21] Alleluia that is our focus as Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ that and has eat it so his edict
[1:32:27] is behind us saying you are I give you
[1:32:29] all authority I give you all the needs
[1:32:31] that you have to be rebuilt and Here I
[1:32:33] am Hartley in waiting for you
[1:32:35] amen and not only that I'm in you
[1:32:37] hallelujah that same stone is right
[1:32:40] within you and the revelation just keeps
[1:32:42] coming out the revelation just keeps
[1:32:44] coming out fall on this my son fall on
[1:32:47] this my daughter look at this in your
[1:32:49] life
[1:32:50] assess that breach in that wall there
[1:32:52] you see hallelujah God says that he
[1:32:55] right at the end time he would bind up
[1:32:58] the breech of his people isaiah 30:26 i
[1:33:02] will bind up heal the stroke of their
[1:33:04] wounds and i will bind up the breech of
[1:33:07] my people as right now that all the
[1:33:11] breaches everything in your life is
[1:33:14] being restored being rebuilt but it's
[1:33:19] not just a magic one amen
[1:33:21] that's a process it's a battle to fight
[1:33:24] the good fight of faith being their
[1:33:26] approach amen because you see if you
[1:33:29] just keep believing all the time you're
[1:33:32] training the subconscious you're
[1:33:34] training the people down in the engine
[1:33:36] room we really do believe that's like
[1:33:39] leading your children if your children
[1:33:42] see you waver and every little thing and
[1:33:44] and the slightest thing comes up and
[1:33:47] you're not at church this list comes up
[1:33:50] in their net and they watch that you're
[1:33:54] training in the wrong way it's false
[1:33:57] leadership it's not a true image that
[1:33:59] they're beholding and because of that
[1:34:01] they get trained in a certain way in one
[1:34:03] day what you've trained them all their
[1:34:05] life will manifest and then you'll be by
[1:34:08] that time you're probably far on on your
[1:34:11] journey and you're looking and you're
[1:34:12] seeing your self again and you're
[1:34:14] looking at that and you're going by now
[1:34:16] this very similar situation to your
[1:34:18] subconscious and between your conscious
[1:34:20] and your subconscious the decisions you
[1:34:22] make in the the testimony that you hold
[1:34:25] in the face of any Sanballat temptation
[1:34:29] any Sanballat struggle
[1:34:33] any symptom even if you're in the middle
[1:34:35] of a fish down the bottom of the sea
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:40] Jonah's subconscious was trained well a
[1:34:42] man they got some good lessons that they
[1:34:44] they may regardless of testable
[1:34:47] regardless of circumstances regardless
[1:34:48] of anything I'm going to hold and you
[1:34:51] know eventually eventually it'll pay off
[1:34:53] you might look like a silly person you
[1:34:56] might look weird and whatever your
[1:34:59] colleagues and friends and whatnot tell
[1:35:01] you and speak to you about but is a
[1:35:04] training going on there's a there's a
[1:35:06] there's a focus going on there's a
[1:35:08] purpose in it and you amen play the long
[1:35:14] game look at that in look towards the
[1:35:17] prize of the high calling amen which is
[1:35:19] Christ amen he brother Brad was here
[1:35:23] because remember this the whole ship
[1:35:25] analogy and everything we won't go into
[1:35:27] it but he said that this ship of Zion
[1:35:30] with the stabilizers on his ship she's
[1:35:32] going to crisp every wave and she's
[1:35:34] going to continue over every way and
[1:35:36] who's waiting on the shore amen who's
[1:35:39] waiting there none other than our Lord
[1:35:41] Jesus amen the high priest themself
[1:35:43] waiting on the shores of the rapture for
[1:35:46] us to be to seeing them to hold them
[1:35:48] with their eyes where faith becomes
[1:35:50] sight amen
[1:35:53] now this is the practical right here at
[1:35:55] the end amen the stones that actually
[1:36:00] rebuild the wall not these should I say
[1:36:02] stones that do because there's other
[1:36:04] parts as well of course let me just hit
[1:36:06] this
[1:36:13] I'm just going to go through a few
[1:36:14] examples and then we're basically
[1:36:15] finished this is a certain situation now
[1:36:22] remember this is generalization and it's
[1:36:24] not pointed at anybody and then many
[1:36:27] times not even it myself but these are
[1:36:30] these are hypothetical circumstance --is
[1:36:33] that I was led to put in here and if you
[1:36:38] can identify with anything here then the
[1:36:41] Lord can deal with that amen so one
[1:36:43] second stance here is I can't bring
[1:36:47] myself to look forward to prayer
[1:36:48] now maybe people go through that and
[1:36:51] these are some of the testimonies or the
[1:36:53] the situation that you can you can
[1:36:57] continue to confess that if you like but
[1:36:59] I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend it I was
[1:37:02] always ignored as a child I was always
[1:37:04] told it's rude to ask for something
[1:37:06] every everything was given to me and I
[1:37:09] was seldom said no told no I'm spending
[1:37:13] too much time under pest of stimuli so
[1:37:16] this is this is a testimony of some
[1:37:18] earnest that's building their life on
[1:37:19] the sand or that was built on sin right
[1:37:22] let personal stimuli psyche
[1:37:24] entertainment just sitting there being
[1:37:26] fed and you do you've got no you've got
[1:37:29] no participation in it Satan opens your
[1:37:32] mind and whatever goes in is just this
[1:37:33] demonic horrendous ordeal
[1:37:36] now that testimony is sandstone if you
[1:37:40] just continue or was always ignored as a
[1:37:43] child and all lowers me that you're just
[1:37:47] going to keep testifying then and
[1:37:48] believing that if becoming that and
[1:37:50] remaining there that's a walls that's
[1:37:52] broken down but instead you should say
[1:37:54] no I love to pray I have a powerful and
[1:37:57] supernatural prayer life God loves to
[1:38:00] hear my voice my prayers change things I
[1:38:03] know what God wants done with his word
[1:38:05] because you do because you're his bride
[1:38:07] he enjoys spending time with you
[1:38:10] hallelujah number two always seeking the
[1:38:12] approval of others may this is one of my
[1:38:15] weaknesses just so you know and it's
[1:38:17] something that the Lord has dealt with
[1:38:18] so much I'll be through many many trials
[1:38:20] trust me I was not appreciated as a
[1:38:23] child now I'm not testifying like this
[1:38:25] is not coming out of me I'm
[1:38:27] listed at some of the thoughts that and
[1:38:29] the things that you can well on but even
[1:38:32] though they might have been your
[1:38:33] circumstance they might have been how
[1:38:36] you were raised and it could have been a
[1:38:38] most of us were raised very negative
[1:38:39] because our parents raised us like the
[1:38:41] appearance and their parents like beard
[1:38:43] and they came out of the Dark Age and so
[1:38:46] it's Babylonian and it's all ruined with
[1:38:48] all sorts of rubbish so we're all in the
[1:38:52] same boat nearly some of us might have
[1:38:54] been raised good amen god bless you you
[1:38:57] must be good on the path you know but
[1:38:59] I'm sure your medals is the same in
[1:39:01] other areas amen
[1:39:03] but anyway I was not appreciated as a
[1:39:05] child even when successful or victorious
[1:39:08] I was never good enough this is things
[1:39:11] that were told I was rejected by the
[1:39:13] popular group at school I watched a lot
[1:39:15] of Disney and Hollywood programs that
[1:39:17] promoted popularity and acting the part
[1:39:20] to be cool and popular I was only ever
[1:39:22] criticized by my parents you see you can
[1:39:25] hold to that testimony but that's just
[1:39:28] sandstone that stuff that you cannot
[1:39:30] build your life off and if you continue
[1:39:32] holding to those things they will keep
[1:39:34] you as a bad self-image and keep you on
[1:39:37] the ground they'll keep you away from
[1:39:40] being able to really fellowship and and
[1:39:43] actually let your gift come to its full
[1:39:47] glory because you see it and this is the
[1:39:52] temptation of sanballat trying to make
[1:39:57] you keep your life and you see it's like
[1:40:00] a drive and people I always need to be
[1:40:03] at seek approval of other people and so
[1:40:06] it's like this Drive and you you know as
[1:40:08] a Christian you don't want that
[1:40:10] and yet it's down in the subconscious
[1:40:12] and the other guy's driving the ship and
[1:40:14] it just seems to happen and even when
[1:40:16] you're doing stuff it's like these
[1:40:18] thoughts just roll around are you going
[1:40:21] to think this is quite good and it's
[1:40:23] actually going to earn me some
[1:40:24] credibility you know what in the
[1:40:26] Christian world you don't need to earn
[1:40:28] one but a credibility God as your
[1:40:30] counselor God as your manager God is
[1:40:33] your marketing have you need marketing
[1:40:35] to go and help somebody or whatever it
[1:40:37] may be
[1:40:38] not that it's marketing but you get
[1:40:40] I mean you're not going to market you
[1:40:42] but you know what I mean like he's going
[1:40:43] to he'll put you on someone's huh
[1:40:45] I need a speak with you or they need to
[1:40:48] go and preach it my they you know
[1:40:50] whatever it may be God does the
[1:40:52] organizing like that hallelujah now we
[1:40:56] can all if we continue thinking on those
[1:40:58] things and dwelling on those thoughts
[1:41:00] and maybe they actually happen but you
[1:41:02] don't need to remain under that identity
[1:41:04] that is not your true identity remember
[1:41:07] you were born in the muck but you came
[1:41:09] up through that mucking it up out to the
[1:41:10] bum of the pond and now by the Lord's
[1:41:13] grace and what he has made you he likens
[1:41:16] you to a beautiful lily and that lily is
[1:41:20] actually produced by the Holy Ghost
[1:41:21] within the beauty of that lily is
[1:41:24] actually the Holy Ghost life that was
[1:41:27] placed than you and cause you to bloom
[1:41:29] you don't need to make it happen you
[1:41:31] don't need to hear that's your true
[1:41:33] identity start actually thinking on your
[1:41:36] real here at regime which is Bible which
[1:41:39] is the Eternity it just is real and
[1:41:41] start confessing you know and these are
[1:41:43] just suggestions you neither have to but
[1:41:45] these you God might give you something
[1:41:47] else because when say this thought oh I
[1:41:50] was never good enough and then when you
[1:41:53] drop something on just so useless I can
[1:41:56] never do it I can never do anything
[1:41:59] right it always just goes to custard
[1:42:01] those are the sort of testimonies that
[1:42:03] because of your upbringing and what your
[1:42:05] parents always said to you those are
[1:42:06] sort you might not say it you might not
[1:42:08] get angry but it might just be an
[1:42:09] underlying thought you know what I am
[1:42:13] satisfied with who God made me I don't
[1:42:17] need the approval of man or woman my
[1:42:20] identity is in the Holy Ghost I'm just
[1:42:24] suggesting things here just to get your
[1:42:26] because these are practical things and I
[1:42:28] do encourage you to actually when you
[1:42:31] when things arise and you actually can
[1:42:34] identify these issues that you face in
[1:42:37] your life this is practical and this was
[1:42:41] not easy like because just remember it's
[1:42:44] ingrained in your habits you do this and
[1:42:46] then that always happens and you say
[1:42:48] this and you think this about yourself
[1:42:49] and all those things that's been going
[1:42:51] on all your life
[1:42:52] and now finally God's shedding light on
[1:42:54] how to get rid of it so now it's time
[1:42:55] it's time to actually put these things
[1:42:58] into full action but before you do it
[1:43:03] make the decision that you're going to
[1:43:05] go right through to the end and this is
[1:43:07] going to be your life from now your
[1:43:09] lifestyle I'm not going to dwell on the
[1:43:12] old past testimonies and actually when
[1:43:14] it rises up you say Lord is that is that
[1:43:17] all of that or is there more of that
[1:43:19] involved in that whole thought process
[1:43:21] and ask the Lord to show you and then
[1:43:24] whatever it comes out write it down
[1:43:26] these thoughts about yourself write them
[1:43:28] down so you can see it and then you can
[1:43:30] renounce that and you can say Lord take
[1:43:33] that out of my life and find the
[1:43:34] opposite rather fantasy do the opposite
[1:43:37] and I'm telling you to say the opposite
[1:43:38] say that if you get a thought I was
[1:43:41] never good enough you say no I don't
[1:43:43] need the approval of men a woman God's
[1:43:45] made me who I am I am bust because God
[1:43:47] made me this way and you see God's
[1:43:49] developing who you really are
[1:43:50] and there might be lots of faults right
[1:43:52] now but you're coming into that image
[1:43:54] you will be who you really are and this
[1:43:57] is one of the mysteries I believe
[1:43:58] revealed in this message is that the
[1:44:00] revelation of who you really are
[1:44:02] that you can be you and as you are able
[1:44:05] to be you are outside of legalism you
[1:44:10] can actually develop but if you're stuck
[1:44:12] under the pressure of a legalistic
[1:44:15] mentality and the real you can't be
[1:44:19] expressed and it's an freedom and it's
[1:44:22] just caged down down down you just saw
[1:44:26] you've got to just let yourself out you
[1:44:32] know obviously within reason you don't
[1:44:34] want to be unruly or anything but you
[1:44:36] see that's being under the right
[1:44:40] leadership in your own life don't rule
[1:44:42] yourself of the rod of iron but allow
[1:44:46] God to lead you in love deep down I want
[1:44:50] to prove myself to God I want to earn
[1:44:52] something from him and this is sandstone
[1:44:55] I was left to raise myself as a child
[1:44:58] parents never spent quality time with me
[1:45:00] and pushed me away for their own
[1:45:02] interests I was never shown love from my
[1:45:04] family I was always
[1:45:06] using privileges due to behavior I was
[1:45:08] always having possessions taken away due
[1:45:11] to performance as a young child you see
[1:45:13] these things yes there are ways to
[1:45:14] discipline your children of thought but
[1:45:16] you see now when it's just always and
[1:45:18] just hard and you'll just drop brought
[1:45:20] up like that you know you can develop
[1:45:21] these thoughts about yourself and you
[1:45:23] can always you end up trying to earn
[1:45:25] something from God end up it's very hard
[1:45:29] for people that have these types of
[1:45:30] sandstone testimonies to be able to
[1:45:32] receive a free gift to be able to
[1:45:35] receive the Holy Ghost these people that
[1:45:38] have these problems and these things
[1:45:39] happened in their past and they can't
[1:45:41] receive the Holy Ghost until it's dealt
[1:45:43] with that's happened but instead when
[1:45:46] these things start to come up
[1:45:48] this is the real testimony this is the
[1:45:49] rock that your walls need to be rebuilt
[1:45:52] with I believe God's grace is sufficient
[1:45:53] I already possess the title deed of
[1:45:56] creation I am a co here with Christ his
[1:45:58] sick that has been extended towards me
[1:46:00] and grace I am on speaking terms with
[1:46:03] God these are all suggestions yeah but
[1:46:07] these are the things that you can say in
[1:46:08] the light of all those thoughts coming
[1:46:10] about yourself you know when you might
[1:46:12] get under a real battle under a real
[1:46:14] cloud sometimes and that Devils trying
[1:46:16] to crush you down and push you to to do
[1:46:18] stuff you know what just start saying
[1:46:22] the breath take those rocks that are
[1:46:26] lying down in your life I believe God's
[1:46:29] grace is sufficient let that rock come
[1:46:30] and form the wall of your life
[1:46:32] don't just let some old mentality
[1:46:39] influence you I am a co here with Christ
[1:46:44] inside I want to shout and praise God
[1:46:47] and laugh but something always holds me
[1:46:49] back and I bottle it up I was always and
[1:46:52] these are some of the sandstone
[1:46:54] testimony of the reason why people can
[1:46:57] get in such a way I was always told to
[1:46:59] be quiet in church I was laughed at and
[1:47:01] completely embarrassed one time when I
[1:47:03] lifted my hands or shouted in church my
[1:47:05] parents thought I was making it up but I
[1:47:07] was seriously praising God and you know
[1:47:09] there could have been times in your life
[1:47:10] when that happen and it caused you to
[1:47:13] just retract down and then you spend
[1:47:15] your whole life not able to praise and
[1:47:17] maybe a light being shed on something
[1:47:21] it could be there but these are this is
[1:47:24] this is just a very hypothetical ample
[1:47:27] but suits don't hard Oh men and just see
[1:47:31] because we should be lifting our hands
[1:47:33] in church and having a good time there's
[1:47:36] no reason not to it's not the stupid
[1:47:38] conservative New Zealand culture away
[1:47:40] with it don't identify yourself avec
[1:47:43] amen let your arms rise name it and if
[1:47:47] they don't rise there's something wrong
[1:47:49] I really believe it because there is
[1:47:51] part of worship to actually be able to
[1:47:54] worship and you know there's some people
[1:47:56] that are quiet peace of course there's
[1:47:58] nothing wrong with being quiet or you
[1:47:59] know but that you'll find that when the
[1:48:01] Lord comes down they start moving amen
[1:48:03] they start getting a bit drunk and they
[1:48:05] start doing things that they would
[1:48:06] normally do amen hallelujah
[1:48:09] but then there's some people that will
[1:48:11] have trouble and they don't know why but
[1:48:14] these are some of the things that could
[1:48:16] have happened I was told as a child
[1:48:18] you're being too clean a costume well
[1:48:20] that would only be in a message Church
[1:48:21] but well maybe in a you know but you see
[1:48:26] now you know when these thoughts come
[1:48:28] you can actually actually override those
[1:48:30] thoughts with light and this is a light
[1:48:33] that can shine on the darkness and put
[1:48:34] it out I can express myself my true self
[1:48:37] freely I enjoy praising God with all my
[1:48:40] heart say it over brother bands have
[1:48:42] repeated over of those thoughts are
[1:48:44] troubling you
[1:48:45] or if something gets identified and you
[1:48:48] and you need oh lord help me I want to
[1:48:51] get away from that mentality I want to
[1:48:52] get away from that way I don't want to
[1:48:54] be held back at my own subconscious from
[1:48:58] being able to worship Lord shine your
[1:49:00] light upon my life so that I can see it
[1:49:02] these our prayers that I pray Lord o God
[1:49:06] why do I do this why am I like this and
[1:49:09] I know it's not really a good trait and
[1:49:12] eventually the little show he will but
[1:49:17] then you know how do you you can pray
[1:49:19] and you can ask the Lord to help you and
[1:49:21] free you and maybe you get freed
[1:49:23] instantly and sometimes you need to just
[1:49:25] start testify the opposite sometimes you
[1:49:27] need to just start doing the opposite as
[1:49:29] brother Branham said amen to get rid of
[1:49:31] something you do the answer
[1:49:33] through something opposite or say the
[1:49:36] opposite and this is in this case I'm
[1:49:37] dealing with confession tonight so
[1:49:40] there's a rock confession because your
[1:49:42] confession is a stone I mean I can
[1:49:45] express myself freely throw that stone
[1:49:47] at the devil I enjoy praising God with
[1:49:49] all my heart save that stone at the
[1:49:51] devil and then I am free to shout and
[1:49:53] praise God throw that stone at the devil
[1:49:55] in Amen it might happen when you're in
[1:49:58] church one day and you're sitting there
[1:50:00] and that very complex is overwhelming
[1:50:02] you and the Holy Ghost is movie you know
[1:50:04] and you know some that one day is just
[1:50:06] going to break and you're just going to
[1:50:07] go hallelujah amen hallelujah and it
[1:50:10] will be broken forever Amen that might
[1:50:14] be for somebody I don't know it might
[1:50:16] not be in here but Amen hallelujah you
[1:50:19] see how we need to be free Saints amen
[1:50:21] to do whatever God puts on our heart to
[1:50:24] do hey we don't any channel this club
[1:50:26] double o'clock as well as we see we want
[1:50:29] the Holy Ghost of flow and since we're
[1:50:30] all got gifts in our life and they need
[1:50:32] to be functioning and all their glory so
[1:50:35] that God gets all the glory got some men
[1:50:38] please or or some guy trying to prove
[1:50:40] himself or some person this will press
[1:50:42] down to schedule a good but for it to be
[1:50:45] free
[1:50:47] amen that's not taking those stones and
[1:50:49] storing them in the devil
[1:50:50] hallelujah baby I struggled to open up
[1:50:53] my true heart to anyone and struggle
[1:50:56] with human leadership I have been hurt
[1:50:58] by those I love most
[1:50:59] I have had a partner leave me for
[1:51:02] another I was raised by a paranoid and
[1:51:04] trusting family I was always told if you
[1:51:07] want it done right do it yourself you
[1:51:09] know these are these are horrible
[1:51:10] mentalities this ania huh I have to say
[1:51:15] but you know I've been raised up under
[1:51:18] some of these things I'm sure a lot of
[1:51:20] us here as well
[1:51:21] sayings that your parents just caught a
[1:51:23] hold of it they thought sounded good and
[1:51:25] they said they you know they called you
[1:51:27] then well they spoke that over your life
[1:51:29] and they've gotten great in your
[1:51:31] subconscious and now you know it might
[1:51:34] have been repressed you might not even
[1:51:35] but there might be a certain lifestyle
[1:51:37] practice there that you don't know why
[1:51:39] and it could be just a little saying
[1:51:41] that your parents sent over you when you
[1:51:43] were young you know what with those
[1:51:45] thoughts start coming at you you throw
[1:51:48] these stones into people I can trust my
[1:51:50] husband the wife with my whole heart you
[1:51:52] know that sounds like it's just for two
[1:51:54] simple doesn't it but it's not you start
[1:51:57] saying it the thought comes and you know
[1:52:01] I'm not saying there might only thing
[1:52:03] sometimes you really hit a pretty where
[1:52:05] you do if you need a breakthrough but
[1:52:07] identifies the little thing in your life
[1:52:09] and you need to pray through but you see
[1:52:13] sometimes this still the memories or the
[1:52:15] habits that are surrounding that and
[1:52:18] when those thoughts starts are coming
[1:52:20] better at you or let's try to raise the
[1:52:22] head again know I can trust my husband
[1:52:25] and model my wife with all my heart it's
[1:52:27] just a testimonial and this testimony is
[1:52:30] a stoner you can throw at the devil
[1:52:31] there you go I can trust the leadership
[1:52:35] in my life I'm safe to love and trust my
[1:52:39] church family with my strength all of
[1:52:43] that what's struggle to open up do the
[1:52:49] opposite my car gets all the brain and
[1:52:52] all the subconscious and every all the
[1:52:53] bells are whistling and all the alarms
[1:52:55] are going and everything just you now
[1:52:59] you know that it's right to do the
[1:53:01] opposite this is where your dominion is
[1:53:04] going to be tested this is where can you
[1:53:07] tape reverse your ol s through love in
[1:53:10] love because the motive is love the
[1:53:13] motive is I don't want that anymore I've
[1:53:16] received the profit that taught me if I
[1:53:18] do the opposite it will change and
[1:53:19] things would really change and some of
[1:53:23] you know I encourage
[1:53:24] that you might not be able to open up to
[1:53:27] the church or trust anybody with your
[1:53:30] whole heart anymore
[1:53:31] remember that it might also come to a
[1:53:35] reflection in your relationship with God
[1:53:37] and not only the church so you have to
[1:53:39] be very careful now when we're faced
[1:53:42] with these things I can open up and
[1:53:45] become vulnerable to my eternal family
[1:53:48] and you can because we all love each
[1:53:50] other there's no judgment or no we're
[1:53:54] not going to scorn your jeer at you
[1:53:55] we're actually growing together and so
[1:53:58] by opening up we love that because we
[1:54:02] know we're growing and you know the the
[1:54:04] the weakest and the strongest not that
[1:54:08] you put measurements on people but just
[1:54:09] for an example
[1:54:10] those strongest is not just running off
[1:54:14] yeah I'm the fastest of the stronger sir
[1:54:16] know that if they've really got God in
[1:54:18] them they're actually right behind the
[1:54:20] weakness they actually praying for the
[1:54:23] young ones and new ones the pray for the
[1:54:25] ones that are sitting on the fence
[1:54:26] they're praying for the one they desire
[1:54:28] to see us all free completely they
[1:54:41] desire us this is we desire us to be all
[1:54:45] completely free and so that's why we can
[1:54:49] confess our confess to each other and be
[1:54:53] free to when we have fellowship
[1:54:54] fellowship is not just to talk about the
[1:54:56] news or talk about the weather or talk
[1:54:58] about the rugby whatever we want to talk
[1:54:59] about fellowship was actually for iron
[1:55:02] to sharpen is it's a it's a it's a
[1:55:05] divine appointment you know when I have
[1:55:08] fellowship with anybody Bronwyn and I
[1:55:11] we've really pray with all our hearts
[1:55:13] Lord let this be any have eternal
[1:55:15] perspective or eternal value you know
[1:55:19] it's fun yes we have a bit of fun and we
[1:55:22] talk and we have a laugh and whatever
[1:55:23] but you know there's always we want to
[1:55:25] have that fellowship where where God is
[1:55:29] sitting with us you know and we start
[1:55:32] talking about heavenly things email and
[1:55:34] you'll find that you can open up to each
[1:55:37] other
[1:55:37] and do the opposite it might go against
[1:55:40] your grain because you might have had a
[1:55:42] past that has the sandstone testimony
[1:55:45] but remember as the pressure comes on
[1:55:48] that sandstone is going to crush down to
[1:55:49] powder those old testimonies those old
[1:55:51] stones you think that near mire and all
[1:55:54] of them when they were searching through
[1:55:55] the stones didn't find some sand and
[1:55:58] find some mud then fine rubbish
[1:56:00] that's what Sanballat was mocking them
[1:56:02] this rubbish all around these walls how
[1:56:04] are you going to get it all are you
[1:56:05] going to revive those stones and I say
[1:56:07] yes all those stones all those
[1:56:10] testimonies these rock testimonies of
[1:56:12] your life let your life now when I say
[1:56:15] this with your mouth right right this is
[1:56:17] not just with your mouth I can trust my
[1:56:19] husband and wife with my whole heart not
[1:56:22] just with your mouth yes that's a good
[1:56:23] start but with your life worth your life
[1:56:27] and it might take you to do the opposite
[1:56:29] these testimonies remember I see that
[1:56:32] the start is not just a verbal testimony
[1:56:34] it's your life my life says I trust the
[1:56:37] leadership in my life amen
[1:56:39] I am safe to love and trust my church
[1:56:42] family do it he that heareth these
[1:56:45] sayings and doeth them I will liken a
[1:56:47] wise man to build his house upon the
[1:56:49] rock where's that rock it's inside you
[1:56:52] your life's being built by the very rock
[1:56:55] of Christ Alleluia
[1:56:58] I fear to allow my gifts to be used I
[1:57:01] find it extremely embarrassing and I
[1:57:03] don't enjoy it remember so it's that
[1:57:05] this is just general so it might not be
[1:57:08] it might be partially it might be fully
[1:57:10] it might be more or less it's just a
[1:57:12] generalization but you know these are
[1:57:14] these are common homes
[1:57:15] I ought now this is this is a sandstone
[1:57:18] I was always told to stop being proud
[1:57:21] when I was used by God I have been told
[1:57:24] it may be the devil using my gift and it
[1:57:27] might not just be a human telling you
[1:57:29] they're Devils can tell you that two
[1:57:31] thoughts come saying I am too
[1:57:34] insignificant for God to use me
[1:57:35] I was never entrusted by my parents to
[1:57:39] accomplish things so these are
[1:57:41] experiences that could have happened in
[1:57:42] your life I was never allowed to help my
[1:57:44] parents with important duties once my
[1:57:47] gift was being used
[1:57:50] but I felt resentment so I don't want it
[1:57:52] to be offensive I want to be offensive
[1:57:55] you know and these tiny little things
[1:57:58] tiny it can be so small can block your
[1:58:03] gift from being used by a little thing
[1:58:07] and you know we're very sensitive
[1:58:08] especially now you get closer and closer
[1:58:10] to each other and so it can take the
[1:58:12] smallest thing to hurt each other and it
[1:58:15] might not be a big giant just a tiny
[1:58:18] little thing like a funny look and if
[1:58:20] you actually take offense to that it can
[1:58:23] be not offense as much as a as a as a
[1:58:26] all maybe they maybe I was wrong or and
[1:58:29] yet you were perfectly right your gift
[1:58:32] was coming into operation but you
[1:58:33] perceived it wrong you perceived it
[1:58:35] through a filter that you made a filter
[1:58:38] of a complex that you make an
[1:58:40] imagination possibly or maybe the person
[1:58:43] was looking at you like that and maybe
[1:58:46] they've got a problem but it's not them
[1:58:48] they might have been having a hard day
[1:58:50] they might have just been staring and
[1:58:52] often another dimension and looking it
[1:58:54] and you might not you see always give
[1:58:57] the benefit of the doubt yes always if
[1:59:00] you don't you'll take everything the
[1:59:03] wrong way on always give the benefit of
[1:59:05] the doubt and if it really is troubling
[1:59:08] contour seriously don't hold off for six
[1:59:10] months because there would be six months
[1:59:11] where your gift might not be an
[1:59:13] operation where you might and you might
[1:59:15] be a musician up here or whatever and
[1:59:17] you're just playing naturally the gift
[1:59:19] is out because these complexes but when
[1:59:21] your gift can be clean and actually in
[1:59:24] the complexes freed when it get we're
[1:59:27] neck ATAR with that drama with that
[1:59:29] piano I'm going to hit the name every us
[1:59:30] right now when it plays the gift is
[1:59:35] operating in God's coming out you know
[1:59:37] this freedom whatever gift that may be
[1:59:40] you know you see these gifts are
[1:59:41] sensitive because it's God it's the Holy
[1:59:43] Ghost the timid dove that comes and
[1:59:45] operates the gifts and so if your
[1:59:47] complexed up and you built up these
[1:59:49] little walls you see it's very hard for
[1:59:51] the Dove to come and come through that
[1:59:55] because he can't he just can't it has to
[1:59:57] be pure
[1:59:58] I can now these are this is the rock
[2:00:00] throw these stones in there I'm sorry
[2:00:02] it's going so long I
[2:00:03] express my gifts and it brings people to
[2:00:05] Jesus Christ I yield my gifts to Jesus
[2:00:08] Christ I am pleased to see God using my
[2:00:12] gift now really we don't own the gift
[2:00:15] it's God I'm just saying that because it
[2:00:17] isn't new and so I see God's grace gave
[2:00:20] it to you and he said you can call it
[2:00:22] yours
[2:00:22] and you know what God gave you the Holy
[2:00:24] Ghost and he gave you life and he said
[2:00:26] you can
[2:00:26] God gave you a predestined seed and he
[2:00:28] gave you the he actually loves you so
[2:00:30] much that he said you can call it yours
[2:00:32] as your seed you are as you how are you
[2:00:36] he gave it to you so you he loves you so
[2:00:39] much so he's actually put that gift in
[2:00:41] your life and it's your gifting and
[2:00:44] you'll tell him now it's actually life
[2:00:47] or death to whether you can whether that
[2:00:50] talent can operate because remember the
[2:00:54] man that got received the one talent
[2:00:55] they had a complex that was all complex
[2:00:58] down and all too scared just in case he
[2:01:00] lost it or something
[2:01:01] Jesus did not deal wery well with that
[2:01:04] man didn't he that man hatch Lee went
[2:01:06] through condemnation because he didn't
[2:01:09] that gift there were there is grace
[2:01:13] enough to free us from every complex so
[2:01:17] that all our gifts can come into full
[2:01:19] operation because as they come into
[2:01:22] operation and their fullness don't be
[2:01:24] fearful don't be scared and if there is
[2:01:29] scare or fear talk it over with them
[2:01:32] talk it over see the pasta whatever you
[2:01:34] need to do anyone company's open up be
[2:01:39] free we love you we love a men I am
[2:01:42] pleased to see God using my gift the
[2:01:44] gift in my life is gone on display click
[2:01:49] this is the last one I fear commitment
[2:01:50] and always step back when faced with a
[2:01:52] voice to commit and these are some of
[2:01:56] the things why reasons why I have been
[2:01:58] dumped by partners soon after I gave my
[2:02:00] heart to him I was always told I would
[2:02:02] never amount to much I was always told I
[2:02:05] wasn't the sharpest tool in the sheet
[2:02:07] now that might sound like a little funny
[2:02:10] thing you say to your children but I
[2:02:11] wouldn't say it Oh seriously I wouldn't
[2:02:13] say that and I don't think any of us
[2:02:15] would
[2:02:15] you know I'm sure many of us were told
[2:02:18] that or maybe I was you guys are
[2:02:20] probably smart but I was told a few
[2:02:23] things my parents divorced now remember
[2:02:26] this is not much is funny but these are
[2:02:30] these are things that can actually cause
[2:02:31] trouble now the rock of that as
[2:02:34] commitment is a joy to me I can do all
[2:02:36] things through Christ I can trust people
[2:02:38] that God gives me you've got or just now
[2:02:44] I'm only saying it so you can actually
[2:02:46] think over your own life it's just to
[2:02:49] trigger some force I'm not saying this
[2:02:51] is you or anyone these are just to
[2:02:54] actually shed some light on situation
[2:02:56] unable to experience or understand
[2:02:59] divine love that's missing the love but
[2:03:02] exposure to abuse of parents or partners
[2:03:04] where you open your heart and it was
[2:03:06] abused exposure to a mother who was
[2:03:09] abused by your father or stepfather etc
[2:03:12] exposure to fear-mongering regarding
[2:03:15] marriage or commitment I was told you
[2:03:18] would not make a good husband or wife
[2:03:20] you see these things and most of the
[2:03:23] time more often than not that what's on
[2:03:25] a natural level with your relationship
[2:03:27] with fellow men and partners and
[2:03:29] husbands and wives is actually going to
[2:03:31] ultimately reflect your relationship
[2:03:33] with God and either hinder it or help
[2:03:35] and now sandstone is going to hinder it
[2:03:37] it's not my foundation but the rock
[2:03:40] musicians can come please this is it I
[2:03:43] love Jesus Christ with all my heart you
[2:03:46] know and I think that you know there is
[2:03:47] this room for us all to come to a deeper
[2:03:50] understanding of God's divine love
[2:03:52] brother Branham said that in the Garden
[2:03:55] of Eden before the fall Adam and Eve had
[2:03:58] a perfect understanding of gods of God
[2:04:00] love had a perfect understanding of it
[2:04:03] experienced that they lived in it now I
[2:04:07] think that you know we're coming into
[2:04:08] that further and further and more and
[2:04:10] more I love Jesus Christ with all my
[2:04:13] heart and I say this every morning over
[2:04:16] and over in my own and as I'm praying I
[2:04:20] think we all do I always testifying how
[2:04:24] much I love them and theirs you know and
[2:04:27] for me
[2:04:28] because I my upbringing was hard and not
[2:04:31] communicated we never told each other we
[2:04:33] loved the my family and so for me to
[2:04:36] actually to feel God's love and
[2:04:40] experience God's love it's taken a long
[2:04:42] time and I'm still probably not where
[2:04:45] I'm definitely not where I should be but
[2:04:47] I want to be there and so for me by
[2:04:50] telling by constantly telling him how
[2:04:52] much I love him and thinking on what
[2:04:54] he's done for me that's generating that
[2:04:56] love I'm pondering over I'm thinking
[2:04:58] about it
[2:04:59] being thankful and thinking over why I'm
[2:05:03] thankful and but in actually expressing
[2:05:06] the gratitude and saying yes thank you
[2:05:08] all I can express my love and word
[2:05:11] indeed I am greatly loved by my family I
[2:05:14] am greatly loved by God and this is the
[2:05:19] final scripture that the communication
[2:05:22] of thy faith may become effectual by the
[2:05:25] acknowledging of every good thing that
[2:05:28] is in you so I encourage your saints
[2:05:32] take those stones that are all laying
[2:05:35] down and maybe you know we're on the
[2:05:37] last level layer of the wall I don't you
[2:05:39] know we could be right there and you
[2:05:42] know I believe we are very close so we
[2:05:44] might be on the top level at all the
[2:05:46] gates maybe you're getting done right
[2:05:48] now but whatever it may be
[2:05:50] let the communication the expression of
[2:05:54] your faith will become a fictional as
[2:05:56] you acknowledge every good thing so take
[2:05:59] every stone that may be laying there and
[2:06:02] let no stone be unturned
[2:06:04] but take every stone and turn it and
[2:06:07] acknowledge it and say yes this is who I
[2:06:10] really am and this is a stone this is
[2:06:12] not a sandstone and I'm going to let
[2:06:14] this become the walls of my Jerusalem
[2:06:17] amen
[2:06:18] god bless you hallelujah let's sing
[2:06:23] what's that song

[2:06:29] heart Oh God

[2:06:42] again I want to scare you away
[2:06:44] but I'm sure faith doesn't when you've
[2:06:46] got real faith you know nothing scares
