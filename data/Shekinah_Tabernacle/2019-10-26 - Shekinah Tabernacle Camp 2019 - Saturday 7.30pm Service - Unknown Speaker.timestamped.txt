[1:03:05] be if Jesus didn't show up amen it'd
[1:03:10] just be another gathering but when he
[1:03:13] comes then the whole dynamic is changed
[1:03:17] hallelujah number 33 let's start reading
[1:03:22] at verse I started verse 50 numbers 33
[1:03:32] and verse 50 the Bible says and the Lord
[1:03:39] speaking to Moses in the plains of Moab
[1:03:41] by the Jordan near Jericho saying
[1:03:43] speaking to the children of Israel and
[1:03:46] say unto them when ye are passed over
[1:03:49] Jordan in the land of Canaan the initial
[1:03:52] drive out all the inhabitants of the
[1:03:55] land from from before you and destroy
[1:03:59] all their pictures and destroy all their
[1:04:02] molten images and quite plucked down all
[1:04:06] their high places and ye shall
[1:04:09] dispossessed the inhabitants of the land
[1:04:12] and dwell therein for I have given you
[1:04:17] the land to possess it
[1:04:20] and ye shall drop and ye shall divide
[1:04:22] the land by lot for an inheritance among
[1:04:25] your family among your families and to
[1:04:29] the more he shall give the more
[1:04:32] inheritance and to the fewer you shall
[1:04:35] give the less inheritance every man's
[1:04:38] inheritance shall be in the place where
[1:04:42] his life falleth according to the tribal
[1:04:45] of your father's he shall inherit but if
[1:04:49] ye will not drive out the inhabitants of
[1:04:52] the land from before you then it will
[1:04:56] then it shall come to pass that those
[1:04:59] which he let remain of them shall be
[1:05:03] pricks in your eyes and thorns in your
[1:05:05] size
[1:05:06] and she affects you in the land wherein
[1:05:09] ye dwell moreover it shall come to pass
[1:05:12] that I shall do unto you as I thought to
[1:05:16] do unto them O my mind let's turn to
[1:05:25] Hebrews the tenth chapter
[1:05:43] Hebrews 10 verse 1 he was tending when
[1:05:49] the Bible says for the law having a
[1:05:51] shadow of good things to come and not
[1:05:54] the very image of those things can never
[1:05:57] with those sacrifices sacrifices which
[1:05:59] they offered year by year continually
[1:06:02] make the comers thereunto perfect for
[1:06:05] then will they not have ceased to be
[1:06:08] offered because the worshiper was purged
[1:06:11] should have no more conscious of sin a
[1:06:16] metal order blessing to the reading of
[1:06:19] his word you can have your seats and as
[1:06:25] you're sitting I want to read another
[1:06:27] verse you know how the book of Romans
[1:06:30] chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 the Bible
[1:06:34] says but what saith it the Lord is nigh
[1:06:38] thee even in thy mouth and in thine
[1:06:41] heart that is the Word of Faith which we
[1:06:44] preach that if thou shalt confess with
[1:06:48] thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:50] shalt believe in thine heart that God
[1:06:54] have risen him from the dead thou shalt
[1:06:57] be saved
[1:06:59] amen you know tonight by the grace of
[1:07:03] God I want to use for subject
[1:07:05] deliverance comes through the blood
[1:07:10] deliverance comes through the blood but
[1:07:13] I want to use for a a subtitle
[1:07:17] unattended habits on attended habits
[1:07:23] amen
[1:07:23] you know as we look right here in the
[1:07:26] scripture and we can see you know that
[1:07:30] God he promised him a land flowing with
[1:07:33] milk and honey and one thing about God
[1:07:37] God cannot lie
[1:07:42] thank God can I fail so if God made a
[1:07:46] promise that promise has to come to pass
[1:07:49] you know but the thing we have to do is
[1:07:52] believe that whatever God said it's
[1:07:55] going to happen don't reason with it you
[1:07:59] know don't don't know try to figure it
[1:08:01] out on your own but just believe that
[1:08:03] whatever God's saying he can keep it
[1:08:06] holy and we ought to stand on the
[1:08:09] promise of God but you know as I get
[1:08:12] started this message I want to talk
[1:08:15] about the power of the blood of a man
[1:08:17] you know Church you know there are
[1:08:19] different places where we can see that
[1:08:22] the blood meant something in the
[1:08:24] scriptures we can see when Adam and Eve
[1:08:27] first fell into sin that the covering of
[1:08:30] religion wasn't good enough
[1:08:31] it had to be blood so God like I said
[1:08:35] and they won God he wrapped him in and
[1:08:38] skin dripping with blood showing them
[1:08:41] that it had to be a life and you know as
[1:08:44] time went on you know man they fell into
[1:08:47] sin I want you to understand this Church
[1:08:50] of God that the Bible says we were born
[1:08:54] as he serving in iniquity
[1:08:57] why because of sin so you need something
[1:09:00] I need something that covers her the way
[1:09:04] we were born we need something that can
[1:09:09] take away our sins your religion take
[1:09:13] you it you church take you it you saying
[1:09:18] I mean the message will do it it has to
[1:09:21] be a sacrifice a sacrifice Stroger to
[1:09:27] the sin in your life and not only a
[1:09:30] sacrifice but it has to be a perfect
[1:09:33] sacrifice it has to be something huh
[1:09:36] that can't connect with you honey but as
[1:09:40] we look that sacrifice earlier that Adam
[1:09:43] and Eve you know God gave them it
[1:09:46] couldn't connect with their soul
[1:09:50] so had sacrifice of pools and coaching
[1:09:53] and all these things
[1:09:54] year by year honey so they could be
[1:09:57] forgiven for seeing that was the old way
[1:10:00] of sacrifice that won't work for you
[1:10:06] going to a farm getting the lamb and
[1:10:09] slaying it it won't work for you you go
[1:10:14] to your preacher go to your pastor Oh
[1:10:17] God will you please go to God and pray
[1:10:20] for me that I be forgiving that will
[1:10:23] work you have to come through the blood
[1:10:30] because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:10:33] could never take away so the desire to
[1:10:36] do wrong you go to the truth priest
[1:10:42] let's just say we was back in that day
[1:10:44] and brother already was my pastor pastor
[1:10:46] Robinson
[1:10:47] and I come to him go to God and pray for
[1:10:54] me cuz I have sinned I have come short
[1:10:58] of the glory of God I got things going
[1:11:01] on in my head
[1:11:02] evil thoughts will you please take it to
[1:11:04] the Lord in prayer and I come and meet
[1:11:07] with the pastor we have fellowship and I
[1:11:10] give him all the things wrong in my life
[1:11:13] he said okay god bless you brother I'll
[1:11:16] take it to the Lord in prayer but then
[1:11:19] he gets a phone call from somebody else
[1:11:22] and forgets all about what I asked him
[1:11:25] to do and he got that person prayers and
[1:11:30] did he get some text from somebody else
[1:11:32] did he forget things they asked him to
[1:11:35] do what would happen to me if the law
[1:11:38] was to come and he forgot to pray over
[1:11:42] my life he forgot to pray over my sins
[1:11:45] you know what
[1:11:46] I'd be lost that's why God took away
[1:11:51] that kind of sacrifice now you and I all
[1:11:55] of us have the opportunity to go behind
[1:11:58] the veil
[1:12:01] we can go to God personally and say I
[1:12:05] need your blood I need to be covered I
[1:12:11] don't have to go to the Congo priests I
[1:12:13] don't have to go to the pastor you know
[1:12:15] we thank God for pastors but pastors are
[1:12:18] not there for you to put the blame on
[1:12:25] let me tell you pastor something a lot
[1:12:28] of times people will come tell you
[1:12:31] different things why cuz they want
[1:12:33] somebody to blame they want somebody to
[1:12:38] put it on when it doesn't work out the
[1:12:41] way they wanted to work out go to God
[1:12:49] who you gonna blame you can't blame God
[1:12:54] because God cannot fail and God cannot
[1:12:58] lie so church when it comes to the blood
[1:13:03] a man in those days you know the
[1:13:05] worshiper he would come and maybe come
[1:13:08] in sin let's just say he was an
[1:13:10] adulterer and he committed adultery he
[1:13:13] take it to the priests the priests say
[1:13:14] oh I got you this one time this year but
[1:13:17] you know what with the pastor and the
[1:13:24] pastor say I got it I'm gonna take you
[1:13:26] to the Lord in prayer and you'll be
[1:13:29] forgiven but he leave with an adulterous
[1:13:32] desire cuz the life of a goat won't
[1:13:39] connect with your spirit the life of an
[1:13:43] animal won't connect with your desire so
[1:13:48] it had to be a sacrifice that could
[1:13:50] change your desires that could change
[1:13:53] your thoughts that could change your
[1:13:55] other tizen habits
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:14:00] had to be a god that could purge you
[1:14:03] purge your conscience from dead work
[1:14:06] so that's why God oh yeah he came and he
[1:14:10] put on fresh let's just before we get
[1:14:14] there let's go up a little bit
[1:14:16] remember when Israel were coming out
[1:14:19] they were a miracle after miracle God
[1:14:21] did signs and wonders God turned blood
[1:14:24] water into blood and and God made fire
[1:14:27] come down from heaven he created Falls
[1:14:29] he created life he caused darkness to
[1:14:31] come down in the land of Egypt God did
[1:14:34] all these mighty things but the last
[1:14:36] thing to come that God did God said I'm
[1:14:39] gonna let the death angel come and
[1:14:42] wherever I don't see the blood the
[1:14:48] oldest child now let's say tonight what
[1:14:53] if the Deaf Angels coming would you make
[1:14:57] it are you covered by the blood what if
[1:15:01] it was your life at stake what have you
[1:15:05] had to have the blood over your house is
[1:15:08] the blood applied when you know you've
[1:15:10] done wrong when you know hurry
[1:15:13] your life is might matching up but the
[1:15:15] death angel is coming
[1:15:16] would you still be shaking your sin or
[1:15:21] would you make sure you ready would you
[1:15:25] make sure the blood was applied
[1:15:27] remember the prophet of God he said he
[1:15:29] said this when he preached this message
[1:15:31] he said
[1:15:45] in the blood of Jesus is the only thing
[1:15:48] that can change your desires but you
[1:15:52] have to accept the Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:15:55] faith oh yeah like I said earlier I
[1:15:59] can't give it to you nobody can give it
[1:16:02] to you it has to be a confession out of
[1:16:04] your mouth it has to be a lifestyle you
[1:16:08] have to be more than just a nice diet
[1:16:14] but we find out we have habits that we
[1:16:19] like and we don't pay no attention to
[1:16:23] those habits but those habits are doing
[1:16:26] something give me the picture of the
[1:16:27] tree I'll show you something and trust
[1:16:32] me by the grace of God I don't want to
[1:16:34] be long I'm gonna preach move out the
[1:16:38] way and give God a chance oh yeah to
[1:16:42] bathe you in this blood look at that
[1:16:48] tree right there I was probably about 25
[1:16:52] feet something like that it's cut down
[1:16:54] now so you can't see I told it was look
[1:16:58] like a tree that's not a tree it's not a
[1:17:04] tree that's a weed that was left
[1:17:08] unattended but it looks like a tree but
[1:17:14] let me tell you something it has no
[1:17:16] value it has no benefit all I was doing
[1:17:20] was taking up space taking up
[1:17:23] nourishment from something else that
[1:17:25] really needed that water that needed
[1:17:27] that sunlight but this twig was left
[1:17:31] unattended and it grew and grew and grew
[1:17:34] and grew to the place it got it away and
[1:17:39] it had to be cut down
[1:17:43] now let me tell you how this crew to
[1:17:46] this place now this came out of my
[1:17:48] pastors yard
[1:17:53] this is his yard this is our church
[1:17:55] right here and you can see there's a lot
[1:17:57] of things growing his house goes back
[1:17:59] this way but he left this right here
[1:18:02] and he says you know you couldn't grass
[1:18:05] you can see some things that need to be
[1:18:07] mowed over there's some things in some
[1:18:11] of our lives tonight that needs to be
[1:18:13] mowed over stop taking pity on the devil
[1:18:19] and your unsaved habits and mow the
[1:18:23] devil completely down but you know what
[1:18:35] happened that tree when it was a twig
[1:18:44] and because it was unattended it just
[1:18:47] started growing cuz one thing about
[1:18:50] twigs and tears they feed on the same
[1:18:54] sunlight they feed on the same water
[1:19:01] that's falling around the grass and
[1:19:03] stuff so you can sit here earlier and
[1:19:07] you can enjoy the presence of God you
[1:19:10] can enjoy the outpouring of God and
[1:19:13] still have no life no substance to give
[1:19:19] back into the body but you look good no
[1:19:28] you totally said this tree just just
[1:19:31] just weed he says he saw it and then he
[1:19:39] saw it growing a little bit and he got
[1:19:42] about this high and something in this
[1:19:45] spirit said cut it down but he reasoned
[1:19:49] with that and he said well because it's
[1:19:53] giving the dog some shade that's our
[1:20:02] problem fees need to be cut down but we
[1:20:06] reasoned with what kind of benefit it
[1:20:08] can be for something else God says get
[1:20:15] out of that relationship and did you say
[1:20:17] Lord I don't want to hurt her feelings
[1:20:21] huh hurting the feelings being in the
[1:20:26] will of God if you don't listen to God
[1:20:30] you and her feelings are going to be
[1:20:33] hurt you say well he said he said
[1:20:41] something even it's what he's trying to
[1:20:50] make a decision
[1:20:51] the weed kept growing what things that
[1:20:56] are in your life and they're being
[1:20:59] unattended huh they're continually
[1:21:01] growing why your reasoning you might say
[1:21:05] well I got I got till I'm 21 why your
[1:21:08] reasoning those demon powers that are in
[1:21:11] your life they're continually growing
[1:21:14] those bad habits that are in your life
[1:21:17] that continually growing it's still a
[1:21:30] twig but you know who's benefiting the
[1:21:34] dog
[1:21:39] and I laugh I laugh so much cuz y'all
[1:21:43] had to know pass this dog he wasn't a
[1:21:48] guard dog he wasn't a tag dog he was
[1:21:54] like I'll see you later dog you walk in
[1:21:58] the yard and you look at you like oh
[1:22:00] that's just you and I didn't state it I
[1:22:06] didn't know him that good but we walk in
[1:22:08] the yard he look at us baby like what's
[1:22:10] up so sometimes the thing that you're
[1:22:18] trying to save don't even need saving
[1:22:26] I'm about to close don't get nervous see
[1:22:34] why we're going this way
[1:22:35] because we haven't entered into a
[1:22:37] complete deliverance yet some of you are
[1:22:41] still holding back and I can feel some
[1:22:44] of the tightness it might be tightness
[1:22:46] or maybe tiredness because some of y'all
[1:22:49] don't like to go to bed and then they
[1:22:57] start growing and growing and growing
[1:22:59] and the dog said Nick he's enjoying the
[1:23:02] pastures unattended habit so church he
[1:23:12] the tree kept going let me tell you
[1:23:15] something
[1:23:15] the reason the purpose for him leaving
[1:23:18] the trees and was for the dog the dog
[1:23:22] died but the twig remained once the dog
[1:23:32] died he wasn't even thinking about that
[1:23:34] anymore he got used to seeing it he just
[1:23:40] walked by and almost like hatred
[1:23:45] let's get this straight in those moments
[1:23:49] he was calling it something that it
[1:23:51] wasn't
[1:23:52] it's not a tree it's a weed it's a twig
[1:24:00] it has no value so I wonder how many
[1:24:04] things how many habits you got in your
[1:24:07] life that has no value all it's doing is
[1:24:15] being a hinderance well probably a month
[1:24:29] ago because we cut it down he he put the
[1:24:36] picture up in Turkey so y'all see this
[1:24:38] right here this is weed he said well I
[1:24:43] let it grow and I let it grow my wife
[1:24:45] kept telling me honey cut it down cut it
[1:24:47] down cut it down he said how often we
[1:24:51] say that when God is telling us to get
[1:24:54] seeing out of our life God is challenged
[1:24:57] some of you young people that seems you
[1:25:00] need to deal with but you keep reasoning
[1:25:02] you keep saying no what I'm gonna do it
[1:25:04] I'm gonna do it one day know what I'm
[1:25:06] gonna do then why are you saying that
[1:25:07] it's growing and growing and growing and
[1:25:10] growing
[1:25:17] it will mature and it will become
[1:25:23] something that you don't like and the
[1:25:29] longer you keep it around the more
[1:25:31] reasons you have to say oh it's alright
[1:25:34] it's like music there's been times when
[1:25:38] a song came on the radio
[1:25:39] and I'm like but again
[1:25:55] and now you're finding where's the music
[1:26:05] make you wanna break it down trust me
[1:26:10] the Spirit of the Lord in behind that if
[1:26:15] the music make you want to get in the
[1:26:16] mirror at the housing trust me there's
[1:26:23] another spirit behind that music because
[1:26:28] worship is not premeditated
[1:26:31] worship is not for you to go home and
[1:26:34] practice so you can make everybody say
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:49] the reason who we left for died but the
[1:26:53] evidence of the we stay there
[1:26:55] so that's just one picture when you cut
[1:26:57] it down I got some warm iPhone you can't
[1:27:00] just cut it down you got to destroy it
[1:27:07] from the root you got to dig it up you
[1:27:11] can't leave this part right here you got
[1:27:14] to dig to stump up because if you don't
[1:27:16] life will come back out of that piece of
[1:27:20] the stump earlier if God is dealing with
[1:27:23] you heart honey
[1:27:24] and there are things in your life you
[1:27:27] must how do you dig it up
[1:27:30] [Applause]
[1:27:32] remember there's a woman the Prophet was
[1:27:34] dealing with and she was she was in the
[1:27:37] psychiatric ward and she was crying and
[1:27:40] saying all these things that all got
[1:27:42] down indeed a promise they come on let's
[1:27:44] pray and she got down to stop principle
[1:27:50] in a prophecy sister you ain't
[1:27:56] stay down there I love it more stay down
[1:28:00] there till you get a breakthrough and we
[1:28:03] found out that people have things in
[1:28:05] their life from the past that they will
[1:28:08] not let go and they bring those things
[1:28:11] to church and then they put the reason
[1:28:15] why they're so unhappy on everybody else
[1:28:17] with Stephen a past that they won't let
[1:28:20] God deal with but then they'll say well
[1:28:24] it's so far why I'm like this and it's
[1:28:26] your fault
[1:28:27] well I'm like this no it's your fault
[1:28:29] you won't let God put all of that
[1:28:32] trouble under the blood look reason why
[1:28:42] I showed you that because numbers
[1:28:45] numbers 33 cents but if you will not
[1:28:49] drive out the inhabitants of the land
[1:28:51] from before from before you see he will
[1:28:54] come to pass the dose which he let
[1:28:58] remain sell shall be pricks in your eyes
[1:29:04] so what's on websites and social media
[1:29:07] and all these things and God didn't told
[1:29:09] you stop going down that road but you
[1:29:12] keep going and you keep going and now
[1:29:14] it's becoming a habit now it's becoming
[1:29:20] something that's just a part of your
[1:29:23] everyday life and you wonder how did I
[1:29:26] get like this because God told you to
[1:29:28] get rid of it and you didn't and now
[1:29:33] it's becoming a part of who you are and
[1:29:35] you want to get rid of it but it's a
[1:29:37] prick in your eyes and the only thing
[1:29:39] that can save you is applying the token
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:51] the only thing that can save you
[1:29:53] it's the come in contact with a life
[1:29:57] stronger than yours
[1:30:01] you know we don't even preach about the
[1:30:04] blood of Jesus no more blood what did
[1:30:08] the blood of Jesus do honey he took
[1:30:11] every sickness every trouble every hurt
[1:30:14] every pain every struggle every trial
[1:30:18] tribulation and Jesus put it on his
[1:30:20] shoulders and he crucified he destroyed
[1:30:25] he annihilated all your problems all
[1:30:28] your weaknesses oh you hurt all your
[1:30:33] pain what happened to it God put it
[1:30:37] under his blood yeah but some of us are
[1:30:46] still carrying things when they don't
[1:30:48] belong to you
[1:30:50] it's supposed to be God's it's supposed
[1:30:53] to be the Lord's but we're still
[1:30:56] carrying it the blood of Jesus
[1:31:05] you say well brother deeds I don't know
[1:31:08] about that there's something called the
[1:31:11] Holy Ghost
[1:31:15] if you get the Holy Ghost it'll do
[1:31:19] something in your life that you cannot
[1:31:22] explain what the Holy Spirit is so
[1:31:28] important cuz I think I did this one
[1:31:34] time before but the Holy Spirit is a
[1:31:41] seal and wherever there's a seal nothing
[1:31:49] can get in and nothing can get out even
[1:31:58] if you drop sometimes if you truly got a
[1:32:02] sail nothing to come out even if you
[1:32:06] kick the r a little bit even if you
[1:32:11] kicked around a little bit if it's a
[1:32:14] good seal nothing to come out and
[1:32:17] nothing to come in if it's really a true
[1:32:24] seal nothing to go out and nothing to
[1:32:27] come in that's the importance of the
[1:32:30] holy cows sometimes life will shake you
[1:32:35] up sometimes you don't know if you're
[1:32:37] coming on you're going but if you got a
[1:32:40] true sale
[1:32:42] [Music]
[1:32:59] the anchor will hold you might say
[1:33:06] brother Deeks I got trouble in my life
[1:33:09] shake shake it up shake it up shake it
[1:33:15] up honey now let me ask you something
[1:33:17] is it still sealed it's still sealed so
[1:33:20] it doesn't matter who has the seal it
[1:33:23] will hold it doesn't matter where you
[1:33:28] come from is this a if it's a true seal
[1:33:30] it will hold if it's a genuine holy
[1:33:34] ghost doesn't matter your background to
[1:33:37] devil your struggles your child cannot
[1:33:40] break the seal
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:50] sometimes you don't know if you're
[1:33:53] coming or going
[1:33:57] you look like you forgotten everybody's
[1:34:01] wondering what happened to you but with
[1:34:04] all the smoke clears and you start
[1:34:07] making your way back to church you start
[1:34:10] working you may make the service they'll
[1:34:12] find out that you got something in your
[1:34:14] life that can't be broken you got
[1:34:18] something in your life that's keeping
[1:34:20] you no matter what you go through
[1:34:23] there's something keeping you and the
[1:34:34] Holy Ghost can keep you through your
[1:34:37] good times through your bad times do
[1:34:43] your struggles do your tribulations do
[1:34:46] your not knowing the seal is your
[1:34:49] protector oh I challenge you to get the
[1:34:58] Holy Ghost before you leave this campus
[1:35:09] and will come back to us
[1:35:23] yucky you know that is that's a pipe
[1:35:30] from under the house then I want you to
[1:35:36] understand out of those pipes came all
[1:35:40] the stuff right here and it clogged up
[1:35:43] the flow of the water coming out those
[1:35:45] pipes how did that all that other
[1:35:51] rubbish how did all that other rubbish
[1:35:57] get inside that pipe when they built the
[1:36:03] house and he put the pipes together no
[1:36:05] doubt none of that was in there earlier
[1:36:08] but as time went on and water started to
[1:36:12] flow there was no seal and because the
[1:36:18] seal was broken another life started to
[1:36:21] be fan right in another life started to
[1:36:29] grow right in the midst where things
[1:36:32] were flowing freely and it grew so much
[1:36:36] - it took over the natural area where
[1:36:39] the water was supposed to flow now I
[1:36:42] want you to understand all these trees
[1:36:45] and twigs that's in the black now didn't
[1:36:47] start that way and I guarantee you the
[1:36:54] things that's going on in your life you
[1:36:57] didn't start that way but some kind of
[1:37:00] way Dean start to seep in I wonder how
[1:37:10] many of us got under tenant habits and
[1:37:14] we don't even realize because we don't
[1:37:16] have a seal something else is growing
[1:37:19] inside of us
[1:37:23] now this one I want you to Xu why didn't
[1:37:27] that grow on outside why did he grow on
[1:37:31] the inside because this pipe was on the
[1:37:35] ground had dirt covered all around it
[1:37:39] but the safe place for life to grow and
[1:37:43] not be detected was on the inside you
[1:37:52] may say well I ain't bother nobody
[1:37:54] no you might not be but there might be
[1:37:56] something inside of you bother you
[1:37:58] there might be something inside are you
[1:38:01] growing like feelings different desires
[1:38:04] and all these things if these things are
[1:38:06] unattended another life will grow inside
[1:38:09] of you and you don't even know it until
[1:38:11] it becomes a cog and because this other
[1:38:21] life start to grow within these pipes
[1:38:25] God is so good
[1:38:27] I was I was preaching out of church and
[1:38:32] a friend of mine as a plumber and I had
[1:38:36] to patch up a pipe at my house and
[1:38:41] because I'm not a plumber my patch-up
[1:38:46] job was very laughable so he had a good
[1:38:52] laugh at my patch up job and then he
[1:38:55] showed me this he said look at this he
[1:38:59] said this is what I was working on today
[1:39:00] I say where was that he said that was a
[1:39:04] photo photo three feet underground
[1:39:09] nobody could see it but it was crawling
[1:39:12] and you can sit in church with that the
[1:39:16] Holy Ghost hallelujah and there'll be
[1:39:18] another life growing inside of you that
[1:39:21] nobody else knows
[1:39:25] look the pipe didn't always look like
[1:39:28] that
[1:39:29] it was once new but that other life was
[1:39:35] always growing because there was no seal
[1:39:38] and as the water seeped out earlier the
[1:39:42] other substance and rubbish and twigs
[1:39:44] and all that stuff it start to grow holy
[1:39:46] got to the place to where life got
[1:39:49] inside of the pipe and then it hatched
[1:40:03] Church the worst thing you can do is we
[1:40:07] sit in church and the devil hatches eggs
[1:40:10] inside your spirit because the seal was
[1:40:26] broken eight unworthy life got in the
[1:40:34] way and what did he do it clogged up the
[1:40:39] pipes and this was the main pipe in the
[1:40:42] house it was just clogged up the whole
[1:40:45] house couldn't function
[1:40:49] I wonder what's in your life stopping
[1:40:58] the flow of the spirit what kind of
[1:41:05] habits you got that you won't get rid of
[1:41:08] that are being unattended you know one
[1:41:14] thing I noticed that the prophet of God
[1:41:16] said he say one thing about demons he
[1:41:19] said if you like doing what you're doing
[1:41:21] you worship that spirit you're not
[1:41:25] looking for the deliverance but you're
[1:41:29] satisfied with how your life is remember
[1:41:35] that woman who had the social disease
[1:41:37] and brother Brendan came to to talk to
[1:41:39] her
[1:41:41] no brother Neville came to talk to one
[1:41:43] of the brothers and she said I didn't
[1:41:45] send for you she said I'm just as safe
[1:41:49] as anybody else get out of here in the
[1:41:53] preface and watch her with a life comes
[1:41:56] to an end and one thing about death
[1:42:03] death takes away all of your reasoning
[1:42:09] cuz you're about to come into the
[1:42:11] presence of reality and you are not
[1:42:14] going the other side oh yeah not knowing
[1:42:18] but you will know who and what you are
[1:42:20] when you're about to change dimensions
[1:42:24] so you can sit in church you can hide
[1:42:26] and you can do all these things and you
[1:42:28] know what you can you can act like
[1:42:29] everything is good but if there's
[1:42:32] something that's screwing inside of you
[1:42:34] it's gonna stop the flow of God give me
[1:42:43] that coat don't get nervous
[1:42:49] see one thing I want you to understand
[1:42:53] without God life is meaningless take
[1:43:02] that down take that down let me say this
[1:43:04] I've been in services where people have
[1:43:08] been delivered from smoking have been
[1:43:11] delivered from marijuana and alcohol huh
[1:43:14] deaf ears opened up blinded see I've
[1:43:18] seen a lot of things so you can't tell
[1:43:20] me God ain't real
[1:43:27] let me said I just I've been at dis camp
[1:43:30] oh yeah three years ago a young man was
[1:43:33] here oh yeah he gave up all his drugs he
[1:43:38] had in a bag
[1:43:39] and he walked up to the past came up to
[1:43:41] me he said you know what I don't need
[1:43:43] this no more I want to serve the Lord
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:47] right here in New Zealand you can't tell
[1:43:54] me God is not real I know a young lady
[1:43:57] in the UK in London England hallelujah
[1:44:01] she was fighting the spirit of
[1:44:02] depression so much cuz she wanted to
[1:44:05] commit suicide it was another life
[1:44:09] growing inside of her and she was in a
[1:44:12] Christian home but she was fighting an
[1:44:15] unseen battle her parents didn't even
[1:44:18] know and one day she went to school and
[1:44:25] she told her teacher she's a very gifted
[1:44:27] young girl she told a teacher I can no
[1:44:30] longer play this worldly music in band I
[1:44:33] can no longer play this worthy music and
[1:44:37] the teacher told her sister hey if
[1:44:39] you're not gonna play what we put out
[1:44:42] I'm going to fail you and that added
[1:44:47] more pressure and then she went home and
[1:44:50] had an argument with one of our sisters
[1:44:52] that added more pressure so that was it
[1:44:56] she said you know what I'm gonna kill
[1:44:57] myself and she went home
[1:45:01] got a loan when nobody could see her
[1:45:03] whenever whatever she did and she put
[1:45:06] some rounds Nick and tried to hang
[1:45:08] herself but in that moment of her trying
[1:45:12] to kill herself hope she her life gang
[1:45:16] on the pastor's heart in the past to
[1:45:19] stop praying for an older sister who was
[1:45:22] walking with her her sister she came on
[1:45:25] her heart so now she got prayer coming
[1:45:28] from the sin and prayer coming from the
[1:45:30] scene and she says she don't know how
[1:45:32] she don't know what happened but all of
[1:45:34] a sudden she lost the desire to try to
[1:45:36] kill herself it left just like that Wow
[1:45:43] because somebody was interesting what
[1:45:48] was it
[1:45:48] it was another life hallelujah the
[1:45:58] church she overcame that battle but she
[1:46:02] can remember the Prophet saying that
[1:46:04] you're gonna have to come to a showdown
[1:46:07] you're gonna have to come to a showdown
[1:46:09] you're gonna have to overcome the spirit
[1:46:13] of depression
[1:46:14] and she went to a camp meeting just like
[1:46:17] this in the UK hallelujah and while she
[1:46:20] was at the camp meeting the Holy Spirit
[1:46:22] started falling in a church the power of
[1:46:25] God came down in the church and she said
[1:46:28] in that moment she could see other
[1:46:29] people being dealt with
[1:46:31] she knew God was there but she said lord
[1:46:33] if this is truly you you know what she
[1:46:36] prayed like that because people always
[1:46:45] Lord if this is truly you lourdes this
[1:46:49] is truly not please father
[1:46:52] God if this is you I need to know father
[1:46:55] I've overcome depression she said god
[1:46:59] this is you listen to her request
[1:47:01] she said Lord as this issue I want you
[1:47:04] to touch my right hand
[1:47:07] [Applause]
[1:47:10] you mean God is so real he can touch
[1:47:13] your hand in service I'm telling this
[1:47:21] testimony to the glory of God Church she
[1:47:24] said in that moment she was praying that
[1:47:26] the Holy Spirit was moving all over
[1:47:28] appears she said lord I need to know
[1:47:30] that I've overcome depression and father
[1:47:33] that I'm your child would you please
[1:47:35] come and plus my right hand she said I
[1:47:39] came over and grabbed her hand and I
[1:47:42] said the powers of depression are broken
[1:47:48] the power of depression is broken in the
[1:47:53] night I will not be used by the devil
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:13] can you imagine what she did when that
[1:48:16] happen in church you talking about
[1:48:21] worship you talk about dancing and
[1:48:24] shouting and giving God praise if God
[1:48:29] ever does anything for you how can you
[1:48:32] be silent
[1:48:41] Church she worships so hard after that
[1:48:45] did she lost her voice and when we got
[1:48:53] to church the next morning after the
[1:48:55] camp the pastor was was going around
[1:48:57] saying who got a testimony she lost her
[1:49:00] voice so she couldn't testify but she
[1:49:03] wasn't gonna lose a chance
[1:49:05] she wrote it down on paper what God did
[1:49:09] for her that's how I knew what the Lord
[1:49:12] he because he even though she lost her
[1:49:16] voice she didn't lose her experience you
[1:49:23] may lose your voice you may not be able
[1:49:25] to touch the fire but that doesn't mean
[1:49:27] your experience is not real Church and I
[1:49:43] can show you a video right now we'd
[1:49:45] heard leading the worship in church and
[1:49:48] it's this world she's playing the piano
[1:49:53] well she plays the piano
[1:49:55] she doesn't even sit down she plays the
[1:49:57] standing up bow Church and she her in a
[1:50:09] system or two out of a family of seven a
[1:50:11] mother and father will take ministry
[1:50:13] they were pretty much cast out for going
[1:50:16] to a local fellowship but they kept
[1:50:18] going and they kept going and when I was
[1:50:21] there in August hardly a couple months
[1:50:23] ago the whole family was in church
[1:50:27] [Applause]
[1:50:35] that's what happens when God gets the
[1:50:39] whole world why am I telling that
[1:50:43] testimony because there's power in the
[1:50:46] name of Jesus to break every chain
[1:50:52] holidays Church and I was in Canada
[1:50:57] hallelujah in for Easter holy and
[1:51:01] eastern me and I told that testimony I
[1:51:06] told that testimony and there was a
[1:51:08] young girl in church hallelujah who wit
[1:51:11] the way of the world
[1:51:12] but now she's trying to find her way
[1:51:14] back her parents they had some struggles
[1:51:17] they had some fights some arguments but
[1:51:19] she's trying to find her way back and
[1:51:21] when I told that testimony she know what
[1:51:23] she did she said lord if you're the same
[1:51:26] God
[1:51:33] if you are Jesus Christ the same
[1:51:37] yesterday today and forever she was in
[1:51:43] the seat in the last row of seats
[1:51:46] oh yeah and she heard that testimony and
[1:51:50] she said Lord if you did that for her
[1:51:53] god I need to know that you are real and
[1:51:56] dealing with me I need brother deeds to
[1:51:59] come put his hands on my left shoulder
[1:52:01] and pray for me I was up at the pulpit
[1:52:06] preaching and it all of a sudden I found
[1:52:09] myself walking through the back
[1:52:21] he's a god taking that's a prayer he's
[1:52:26] the god of a total deliverance
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:35] you don't have to carry it no more
[1:52:39] search and from there huh Lia I walked
[1:52:42] out the pulpit and I know the Spirit of
[1:52:44] God was moving just like it is in here
[1:52:49] did you catch that just like it is in
[1:52:53] here he's the same God in church I shot
[1:52:58] myself in the back of the church
[1:53:00] huh Lia and I saw her and maybe two
[1:53:03] sisters gather with her and it looked
[1:53:06] like she didn't need no prayer but
[1:53:08] something was compelling me to go lay
[1:53:10] hands on her and I went over there and I
[1:53:14] laid not my right hand
[1:53:16] oh just like she asked now can you
[1:53:26] imagine what that did for a young girl
[1:53:28] who was struggling who had other kids
[1:53:33] habits in her life but now God is
[1:53:36] putting his hand God is putting his hand
[1:53:39] on her shoulder and the Lord is saying I
[1:53:42] am real can you imagine when God comes
[1:53:48] to show how real he is that was a
[1:53:59] defining moment church it starts in
[1:54:08] service
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:15] in that same service another sister she
[1:54:20] said lord if you did that for her these
[1:54:24] two girls were praying the same prayer
[1:54:26] cuz they heard the same testimony and
[1:54:29] they believed in the same God this other
[1:54:33] so sitting up in the front I remember
[1:54:35] what she was she was on the our Ohana
[1:54:37] and she was praying a prayer
[1:54:39] she said lord if you can do that for her
[1:54:41] I need you to touch my right hand and
[1:54:46] deal with the struggle and as soon as
[1:54:51] she prayed after I heard the young girl
[1:54:57] in the back hands laid on her as I was
[1:54:59] walking back up to the front oh yeah I
[1:55:01] saw that young girl hands extended and I
[1:55:04] grabbed it earlier and I started praying
[1:55:06] for her holy and rebuking all of her
[1:55:09] mind battles just like she acts God
[1:55:19] my gift does not belong to me it belongs
[1:55:22] to you can you believe can you believe
[1:55:33] in a God that can touch can you believe
[1:55:37] in a God that can speak a God that can
[1:55:41] carry you you are a son hallelujah you
[1:55:44] are called to be a son of God you
[1:55:47] believe in a God whose personal in that
[1:56:02] same meeting a young girl was worshiping
[1:56:06] she had her hands lifted we was in a
[1:56:08] tent she had her hands lifted and when
[1:56:11] she looked up the top of the tent was
[1:56:13] gone and she said she saw the face of
[1:56:15] Jesus looking down on him as they
[1:56:18] worshiped now can you imagine what that
[1:56:21] did for her to see God looking down on
[1:56:24] her and she worship nobody else saw it
[1:56:30] but nobody else can take away what she
[1:56:33] saw Church in the same meeting earlier
[1:56:41] after the meeting was over a young man
