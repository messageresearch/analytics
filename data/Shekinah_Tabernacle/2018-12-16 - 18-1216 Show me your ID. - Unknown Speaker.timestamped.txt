[36:10] brother any comes this morning
[36:12] [Music]
[36:42] as we wait
[36:43] [Music]
[37:28] [Music]
[37:41] Jesus father we just come before you
[37:44] with the deepest reverence insincerity
[37:47] Lord their fathers in our life at the
[37:50] bottom of our hearts Lord we come Lord
[37:53] humbly before your throne
[37:55] Lord Jesus approaching you through the
[37:58] shed blood of Calvary Oh Lord that the
[38:02] price was paid it was sufficient that we
[38:05] could come and we could approach God
[38:07] again there is nothing between my soul
[38:10] and my Savior
[38:12] Alleluia or Jesus and we have steadfast
[38:16] confidence that the sacrifice that you
[38:19] made when you became flesh and you
[38:21] became a man because a man needed to pay
[38:24] the price of redemption you came and you
[38:28] paid it all and you displayed what a
[38:30] real man is you are the image of a true
[38:34] man a real true rugged real man and you
[38:39] were revealed that we could have an
[38:41] example and then the same spirit that
[38:44] was in you would come in us that we
[38:47] could live like you and I pray father
[38:50] that you would impress us that you would
[38:54] place a eternal impression of the image
[38:58] of your son and every heart in this room
[39:01] that every heart would receive an
[39:04] impressive image of the Son of God and
[39:08] their heart then I prayed it for the
[39:11] camp to Lord that the youth Oh Lord how
[39:13] people can as the human being is made
[39:15] Lord in such a way
[39:17] they see something and they analyze it
[39:19] and they want to be like they want to be
[39:21] like that musician they want to be like
[39:23] that what they saw there and impress
[39:25] them the devil's out there to impress us
[39:27] lon but father there's a greater image
[39:30] not some golden statue or some flesh car
[39:34] or some pretty woman or some rock star
[39:37] but the image of the son of God Lord
[39:41] this is Luke this is who we need to be
[39:43] impressed by and our youth that set the
[39:45] camp the people the rising next
[39:49] generation father I pray Lord that that
[39:52] image would deeply impress their hearts
[39:55] father I pray O God that then Lord you
[39:59] would deeply move each one and that
[40:02] image would just become so branded by
[40:06] fire in their hearts Lord Jesus and even
[40:10] this morning Lord the word that you
[40:12] desired and the the Oracle of God the
[40:19] supernatural seed in the word you desire
[40:24] for Jesus to minister linen impress us
[40:27] let us become sufficiently impressed by
[40:31] the message that you have sent us by the
[40:35] Holy Spirit that is speaking from the
[40:38] voice that cries from the blood that was
[40:41] spilled in the earth Lord we remember
[40:44] her the blood of Abel spoke vengeance
[40:47] that spoke did vengeance my brother
[40:51] killed me you said that the voice of thy
[40:54] brother's blood speaketh from the earth
[40:56] but we read in the book of Hebrews law
[40:59] that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks
[41:02] better things he meant it speaks liberty
[41:04] that speaks identity it speaks freedom
[41:07] it speaks the shackles are broken it
[41:10] speaks Liberty from sin
[41:12] it speaks life that speaks our true
[41:16] eternal nature our true freedom who we
[41:21] really are not the pseudo reality that
[41:24] we see here that has been fabricated by
[41:26] Satan but the reality of the true
[41:30] heavenly realm that is eternal
[41:33] let that be established this morning
[41:35] father that your anointing father meet
[41:38] every need
[41:39] speak into hearts discern speak the
[41:44] needs father of the hour I yield myself
[41:47] to your Lord and I ask Lord that you
[41:49] would grant prophetic utterance divine
[41:51] intervention Lord that the word would go
[41:54] forth and it would preach down into
[41:56] every heart every life let no stone be
[41:59] unturned
[42:00] hallelujah may you expose all the
[42:03] unfruitful works of darkness shine your
[42:06] lights that glorious light where the dew
[42:09] drops of Mercy a bright shine that light
[42:12] Lord and to every huh
[42:14] let the day star rise and every heart
[42:18] this morning father I pray that it would
[42:20] be new births in this room I pray Lord
[42:23] that you would penetrate beyond the
[42:25] intellect this morning Lord and let
[42:27] faith rise because father no man can
[42:31] come to you except the son drawsome and
[42:34] I pray that you would draw all men unto
[42:36] yourself as we lift you up high as we
[42:38] give you glory Lord Jesus have your way
[42:42] just commit the service into your hands
[42:44] law I humble myself under your mighty
[42:47] hand and pray Lord that our true
[42:49] identification would be realized this
[42:52] morning Jesus Christ's name hallelujah
[43:01] well praise the Lord these differently
[43:04] the anointing it's already very thick
[43:09] hallelujah can you turn the pulpit one

[43:24] standing we shall turn in our Bibles to
[43:29] job chapter 38 verse 4 man
[43:46] well praise the Lord say Amen when you
[43:49] bring you there
[43:51] hallelujah joy 38 verse 4 says when
[43:56] we're where were you
[44:00] I'm gonna I'm calling that to you where
[44:05] were you when I laid the foundations of
[44:11] the earth declare if you have
[44:14] understanding who has laid the measures
[44:17] thereof if you know or who has stretched
[44:26] the line upon it we're upon other
[44:29] foundations thereof fastened or who laid
[44:33] the cornerstone thereof when the morning
[44:37] stars sang together and all the sons of
[44:40] God shouted for joy where were you amen
[44:46] it's lord I pray that you add your
[44:48] blessing to the reading of your word and
[44:50] I pray father that you would reveal
[44:52] where we were when these things happen
[44:57] Jesus Christ amen
[45:00] do I have a slideshow here not that I'm
[45:04] doing a slideshow but I just want to
[45:06] have the Spanish for our Spanish friends
[45:08] well I didn't Indian friends say you can
[45:13] have your seats amen hallelujah I want
[45:17] to speak now the sermon title is as you
[45:19] can see show me your ID
[45:22] now I hope that many of you don't know
[45:25] what that means because you didn't do
[45:27] the things that I used to do but if you
[45:30] did the things that I used to do and you
[45:32] looked as young as I used to look
[45:33] hopefully I still look that way you get
[45:37] you hear this a lot well I heard this a
[45:40] lot anyway always I was always looking
[45:43] younger than I was so everyone always
[45:44] asked me for ID for things that were
[45:46] restricted by age we'll leave it there
[45:49] now we need our ID to prove who we are
[45:54] our ID proves our who we really are
[45:59] okay so we need that and not just for
[46:03] those things but we also need that when
[46:04] we travel around the world and we we go
[46:06] to different places or we need to apply
[46:08] for some official you know document or
[46:12] something we need to prove who we are
[46:13] and so you carry this ID and it says
[46:16] this is who I am this is me and you
[46:18] display that when someone calls for that
[46:20] you say yes this is me I'm I'm this
[46:22] person and they believe it because they
[46:24] see that it as a genuine ID and I trust
[46:27] that you are displaying your genuine
[46:31] identification in your life is that the
[46:34] real you or has your real identification
[46:38] asking you these questions now as a kind
[46:40] of a start to foundation thing and then
[46:42] we'll go and I'll just kind of open up a
[46:45] little bit about it but so as they you
[46:47] displaying the real you or has your real
[46:52] identification either never come and you
[46:56] are waiting on that or has been stolen
[46:59] because your identity can get stolen
[47:01] we know now there was some sisters and
[47:04] Auckland that lift their wallets in the
[47:06] car you know and and they went on a bush
[47:09] walk and when they came back someone had
[47:11] jumped in the car broken the window
[47:13] whatever and stolen all their
[47:14] identification so they couldn't prove
[47:16] who they were now that's just naturally
[47:17] but spiritually speaking now we have an
[47:21] enemy and his main goal because he can't
[47:25] what he can't do is he can't really
[47:27] can't destroy you because if God be for
[47:30] us who can be against so what he will
[47:33] try and do is he will try and lead you
[47:35] down garden paths he will try and lead
[47:37] you down roads that look good at the
[47:39] start but then they turn into gravel and
[47:41] they turn into big deep mushy gravel and
[47:43] you get no traction you can't really get
[47:45] anywhere and you start losing control
[47:47] because there's no traction on gravel
[47:50] but the devil's roads always start off
[47:52] as tarmac
[47:53] you know I remember once when I was
[47:55] driving man this is a real good example
[47:57] of what I'm saying here so I was very
[48:00] young in the Lord and and I hadn't
[48:04] driven the whole new New Zealand Island
[48:07] North Island for years and obviously
[48:10] been there having been in prison
[48:12] those things I it was a long time since
[48:14] I had driven right at the island and I
[48:15] went I had this map and the map was
[48:18] pretty vague it was that actually it was
[48:21] the title was actually on it was the
[48:23] front of the book so it was just really
[48:25] an abbreviated version of them happen
[48:26] you know that says something then we
[48:29] don't want to follow an abbreviated
[48:30] Bible doing we don't just want some
[48:32] modern Bible that abbreviates the Word
[48:35] of God because that's God's Word
[48:37] hey we want something that is genuine
[48:39] anyway so I'm following this map and it
[48:42] has one road I get to topo and this it's
[48:45] got from tapos stemming one highway five
[48:47] and I knew that I had to take Highway
[48:48] five out of tapper
[48:49] and little for knowin Stu me I ended up
[48:54] taking Highway 5 to why Orand yrl waro
[48:59] so I'm instead of going up Highway five
[49:02] are we're to cross down the other
[49:03] highway five I don't know why they have
[49:05] to highway 5 but anyway they do and so
[49:08] I'm driving happily fellowshipping with
[49:10] Joe and the car and we're just going for
[49:12] it and we're meant to be in terrible at
[49:13] a certain time and we're going the
[49:15] opposite direction now so I'm following
[49:16] a garden path because I looked at a map
[49:19] that wasn't completely you know it
[49:21] wasn't it wasn't accurate this met was
[49:24] taking me on another direction but it
[49:25] was so I'm following this thing and I'm
[49:28] like oh man now I have a choice now do I
[49:30] I spent three hours now driving in this
[49:33] one direction and I get a nice and I get
[49:35] to the teachers I'm like man this is I
[49:37] haven't driven the for a long time but I
[49:38] think this is not this is there's
[49:41] something going on here and then I get
[49:43] to the first intersection and it's got
[49:46] Napier and yrl or the other way around I
[49:50] think it was there and so I'm like what
[49:52] the Rotorua of Tehran there or
[49:55] Aucklanders gone the wrong way
[49:58] and I'm completely like oh dude and I'm
[50:00] like do I go back on that boring road
[50:02] and go the same way again or shall I
[50:06] just find another route up there and
[50:07] hasn't gone an adventure so I mean that
[50:10] I've gone through I ended up going down
[50:14] white lake waikaremoana and this road I
[50:18] looked at the map and I thought yet now
[50:19] looked at the real map this time I made
[50:22] sure it wasn't just the front you know
[50:24] the actual
[50:25] Paige the front cover of the book I went
[50:28] into the book and looked properly and I
[50:30] and I look at this thing and I go okay
[50:33] yes wheatless blake why correct my honor
[50:34] it takes me right back into five again
[50:37] and it's a bit of a detour it's gonna
[50:39] take me about three hours by the looks
[50:41] of it but anyway I'm gonna go through
[50:42] and have a nice scenic route so I Drive
[50:44] and it's all nice normal Road and then
[50:46] it goes to gravel and I'm like oh dear
[50:48] then it goes even worse it goes to mud
[50:51] and we're going through the bush
[50:52] and I think and my clutch was failing
[50:54] and I think man I hope I don't get
[50:55] attacked by like the local tribes or
[50:57] something you know if I put the car
[50:59] brakes because the clutch was not
[51:01] working very well and man it wasn't
[51:03] really it wasn't a pretty it was it was
[51:05] actually cutting I was like man but
[51:07] anyway the the moral of that story there
[51:10] is their road may look like it's sealed
[51:13] and good and it might look no that's
[51:15] just what the devil does that's what the
[51:17] enemy does as he makes the road look
[51:19] okay but there are ways that seem right
[51:21] to a man but the end thereof is death
[51:23] you know we can get caught up in their
[51:26] recent faculty and we can get caught up
[51:28] and and their whole mental realm and and
[51:31] it looks really good in it and we strive
[51:33] figure it all out but man cannot lead
[51:36] himself man is we're following something
[51:39] we're always following something or
[51:41] somebody or some influence or some image
[51:43] that has been displayed through some
[51:46] medium on in this society is always
[51:49] something that that could catch our
[51:51] attention and lead us down a certain
[51:52] path but we don't need that and and
[51:56] really the only true foundation that we
[51:59] want to follow is the Word of God amen
[52:01] that is the actually only true full
[52:04] reality that there is in existence as
[52:07] the Word of God the revealed pure true
[52:11] Word of God is the foundation of all law
[52:14] of all righteousness and of all judgment
[52:17] and of all mercy every thought that as
[52:20] pure comes from the word because that's
[52:22] God's preserved Symphony preserved sheet
[52:27] music blueprint whatever you want to
[52:29] call it for life for where we came from
[52:32] while we're here and how to get to where
[52:33] we want to go because no one wants to go
[52:35] down into
[52:37] the place that's void of all love and
[52:39] void of all joy and void of anything
[52:41] that has anything to do with God because
[52:44] that's where people go if they don't
[52:45] want them here they will get their wish
[52:47] and they'll end up where they think they
[52:50] want to be which is away from God but
[52:52] actually if you want to be with God and
[52:55] you want God now you'll get him in his
[52:57] fullness when you know and when you're
[53:00] raptured I mean lujah so yes we want we
[53:03] want to make a very we want to be
[53:06] prayerful about the paths that we take
[53:08] we want to be discerning now because I'm
[53:11] going to go into what these pads are and
[53:14] I'm not going to deal with every path
[53:15] because such a vast subject you know
[53:17] show me your ID
[53:18] you know identification the
[53:21] identification subject is so vast we
[53:23] could be here for weeks months on
[53:25] identification but I want to just sort
[53:28] of hone down into what paths of thought
[53:32] because thought is a very important
[53:35] factor of our life because we're
[53:37] thinking all the time and what we think
[53:40] on we become you are no higher than your
[53:43] thoughts and what you believe you are
[53:46] you are and you believe you can't you
[53:48] want if you believe you can you will
[53:51] that's what you believe and Jesus laid
[53:54] these things out and it wasn't just laid
[53:57] out just for Christianity was laid up
[53:59] for Humanity if you believe that you can
[54:01] happen if you have faith and believe
[54:03] that that mountain removed that shall be
[54:05] moved that goes for any human because
[54:08] every human has an element of faith
[54:10] inside them whether they are a true
[54:13] vessel that as a channel of God's glory
[54:15] or whether they're a channel of anything
[54:17] they have faith because they're a human
[54:18] they've been given a set sense to
[54:21] believe but I just thank the Lord that
[54:24] we can yield our gift we can yield our
[54:27] life we can yield our everything to the
[54:29] Holy Spirit to the true foundation of
[54:32] the Creator that created this earth that
[54:34] holds this whole universe together by
[54:36] his word hallelujah
[54:39] so as an outline I want you to look into
[54:43] your life what identification are you
[54:47] carrying
[54:48] if someone says show me your ID now I'm
[54:50] just
[54:50] is an analogy but no one's gonna say
[54:52] show me and you're a Christian you know
[54:55] but now I'm talking in a spiritual
[54:58] context here show me your ID
[55:00] what life are you displaying what
[55:02] identity as has lived out not just
[55:05] consciously now subconsciously what
[55:07] identity is being expressed out of your
[55:09] life is that identity your true eternal
[55:14] identity which is your inheritance which
[55:16] has been given to you you know and you
[55:19] hit the fight foot to keep that you have
[55:20] to fight to lay hold of that that's your
[55:23] true identity and it's in the Holy Ghost
[55:24] the Holy Ghost is your identification
[55:26] but now the devil can come into your
[55:29] thoughts and start distorting things and
[55:31] twisting things and you start getting
[55:32] caught up in your business you start
[55:34] getting caught up in politics you start
[55:35] getting caught up and all these waves of
[55:37] ideas and opinions and all these things
[55:39] what are they to do to do to distract
[55:42] you from your identification because a
[55:45] huge portion of your experience here is
[55:49] based on what you are consciously
[55:51] thinking on your experiencing I'm not
[55:54] talking about your your eternal
[55:56] inheritance I'm not talking about what
[55:58] you are by what God sees you but I'm
[56:00] talking about what you experience well
[56:02] how much quality of life you have here
[56:05] if you want quality of life and you want
[56:07] your identification to really be that
[56:10] you're really in fellowship with God and
[56:12] that supernatural presence is with you
[56:14] and it shows you things and angels come
[56:16] to you and you start seeing supernatural
[56:19] stuff unfold and the Bible speaks to you
[56:21] personally and God reveals himself to
[56:24] you and you start reading your life like
[56:26] you're reading the Bible and how God
[56:28] came to them because the same thing can
[56:30] happen to you but what are you thinking
[56:34] what is your life spin table where are
[56:38] you what are your fantasies no I don't
[56:40] say that in a dirty way or anything I'm
[56:42] saying what do you fantasize about what
[56:45] do you imagine as good and what are you
[56:47] thinking on all the time what is your
[56:50] heart because your heart has a voice
[56:52] you'll soul has a voice your will what
[56:55] is coming out what is being expressed is
[56:57] that worship are you worshiping them in
[57:01] your heart now
[57:02] it's a subconscious worship it just as a
[57:04] stream what is it so I want you to look
[57:08] into your life what idea you carrying is
[57:11] is it real or has your real ID been
[57:16] stolen and replaced with a fake ID
[57:18] because there's a lot of fake IDs this
[57:22] world is full of fake IDs people put on
[57:24] a masquerade they put on a front they
[57:27] put on something that's just a fake ID
[57:30] because they saw Katy Perry or some pop
[57:33] star and they like that and impress them
[57:36] and and and so their identification is
[57:39] that and they dress like that and they
[57:40] put their posters up in their rooms and
[57:42] they they love it
[57:43] or they see some tough guy they see some
[57:46] tough guy and they want to be a tough
[57:48] guy you know or they want to be they
[57:49] want they see some rugby player and they
[57:51] want to be like that they want to see
[57:52] some cricket player and they want to be
[57:53] like that therefore they've been given a
[57:55] fake ID because that image of that
[57:59] Sportster has been impressed upon them
[58:02] branded like a branding iron into their
[58:05] subconscious and therefore they get joy
[58:08] they get dopamine released into their
[58:09] mind when they start to act like that
[58:11] and they feel good makes them comfort
[58:14] and human life there's a preservation of
[58:18] your own comfort until you get the Holy
[58:20] Ghost and then you still try and
[58:22] preserve your comfort but you think
[58:23] about this first
[58:24] okay so we always want to be comfortable
[58:26] that's just human nature we want to be
[58:28] comfortable we want to be happy we don't
[58:31] choose to go through hard times we don't
[58:33] choose to go through trials but the
[58:34] choices that we make and the paths that
[58:37] we think on will determine these things
[58:39] they will allow us to go through because
[58:41] God does not want us to be thinking
[58:43] about all these other things all the
[58:44] time and actually as we get into the
[58:46] sermon I'll show you exactly what God
[58:49] actually wants for us in this hour what
[58:52] he wants for us what is our true
[58:53] identification and so I'm going to give
[58:55] you an over because it's such a a vast
[58:58] subject I'm just going to focus on four
[59:02] points here and this is who we are
[59:06] our Fortin and the second point I want
[59:09] to hand us our thoughts need to be on
[59:10] Christ all the time with heart worship
[59:14] and the third place that we want to move
[59:17] then into the revelation of our
[59:19] spiritual habitat now these things can
[59:22] be all Simmons and themselves but we're
[59:23] just going to go over view and a few if
[59:25] you do have time you know because I will
[59:28] put unpacking in a lot of content you
[59:30] can't listen to this again here you can
[59:31] go over you can take notes take
[59:32] scriptures because if we're going to
[59:34] read a lot and then I'm going to
[59:37] summarize the whole thing and the story
[59:39] of deborah and barak because there's a
[59:41] power that's released in their union
[59:43] that frees people that frees people and
[59:47] it's a responsibility that we have with
[59:49] our union and marriage to Christ and
[59:52] it's something that happens when we
[59:56] really become what I'm talking about
[59:58] today and really have and it's something
[1:00:00] that you actually possess you have your
[1:00:03] real identification but is it being
[1:00:06] displayed when someone says show me your
[1:00:08] ID now analogy again and it opens up
[1:00:11] your wallet of your life and and they
[1:00:13] see it is that you your eternal image is
[1:00:18] that who God thought of you before the
[1:00:19] foundation of the world where were you
[1:00:22] when this morning stars sang together
[1:00:24] and the sons of God shouted for joy I
[1:00:27] tell you where you were you were there
[1:00:29] hallelujah Amen you were there before
[1:00:32] the world was ever formed because you're
[1:00:35] an eternal being hallelujah euros
[1:00:38] eternal is God is eternal you come from
[1:00:41] God and you're going back to God
[1:00:42] hallelujah because you're his sons and
[1:00:45] daughters you're his family you were in
[1:00:48] his eternal mind
[1:00:49] now our thoughts start and they begin
[1:00:51] and they get fragmented maybe that but
[1:00:52] God's done those thoughts are eternal
[1:00:54] they're established they never change
[1:00:56] they're the exact and before the world
[1:00:59] was in again began his whole mind which
[1:01:01] is eternal and unfathomably amazing
[1:01:04] omniscient just for him everything
[1:01:06] thought of all of you and all your
[1:01:08] identity your real identity and he knew
[1:01:12] that you would struggle you would have
[1:01:14] hard times you would go down gravel
[1:01:16] roads that look good at the start and
[1:01:17] became hard and you wiped out and you
[1:01:20] realize that when you open your wallet
[1:01:22] there was a fake ID inside there and not
[1:01:25] a real ID and then you
[1:01:26] say lord save me like Peter when he was
[1:01:28] sinking down in the water he said lord
[1:01:30] save me
[1:01:31] and sometimes we just have to do that we
[1:01:33] have to humble ourselves and realize
[1:01:35] that this identification that is being
[1:01:37] displayed in my life has come from some
[1:01:39] impressionable image out there and not
[1:01:41] from the gods revelation of who Jesus is
[1:01:45] now what is Jesus doing this second what
[1:01:49] is his program has planned because when
[1:01:52] we realize that we will be placed in our
[1:01:54] habitat and when you're placed in your
[1:01:56] true spiritual habitat where you are
[1:01:59] made for you will express your true
[1:02:01] identification that's true when you're
[1:02:04] placed in the habit and I'm going to
[1:02:06] place you today and you're hepatech
[1:02:08] hallelujah amen amen
[1:02:10] well I'm going to preach it anyway it's
[1:02:11] up to you whether you get placed there
[1:02:13] or not
[1:02:13] hallelujah I'm going to preach about
[1:02:15] what's going on in this hour so just a
[1:02:18] little overview because we can't exhaust
[1:02:20] these things it's inexhaustible
[1:02:21] hallelujah but we'll just touch on a few
[1:02:24] things they meant about some front-page
[1:02:26] news or what's going on in this very
[1:02:27] hour who wants to know what's going on
[1:02:29] in this very hour
[1:02:30] who wants some front-page news that's
[1:02:33] more current than the Dominion Post in
[1:02:35] four years time amen hallelujah because
[1:02:38] God is prophetic he tells you things
[1:02:41] before they happen because he knew it
[1:02:42] would happen
[1:02:43] hallelujah he knew every nature of every
[1:02:46] man he knew the societies and how every
[1:02:48] nature and every person would ever
[1:02:49] evolve and become a certain way without
[1:02:52] even interfering of their free will he
[1:02:54] would just inspire this one and inspire
[1:02:56] they learn and give that one faith and
[1:02:58] bring this one forth him through that
[1:02:59] and put them all together to make you
[1:03:01] hallelujah
[1:03:02] physically and make your personality and
[1:03:05] then he had put let your life become a
[1:03:07] race become a challenge become a battle
[1:03:09] so that it would reform you and he would
[1:03:12] put his image in front of you he would
[1:03:14] preach his true word to you so that that
[1:03:17] image could become impressed open your
[1:03:19] heart this morning and let his image and
[1:03:22] press you howl ooh you go beyond this
[1:03:27] thing you know the devil is so good at
[1:03:31] working with us and all I'm just going
[1:03:34] to say stop listening to him don't
[1:03:37] listen to
[1:03:37] anything that makes you feel negative
[1:03:39] anything that stones have pulling you
[1:03:41] down or try and pull someone else down
[1:03:43] on degrade who you are what God says you
[1:03:46] are in the Bible you have authority over
[1:03:51] those things those of power of
[1:03:54] suggestion the devil is the master of
[1:03:56] power of suggestion because he knows how
[1:03:58] the human psyche works he knows how it
[1:04:00] works he just has to keep doing
[1:04:02] something and he and he starts to
[1:04:04] breathe familiarity and he starts to I
[1:04:06] can't remember what that there's a term
[1:04:08] actually I've got it here it's called
[1:04:11] mere-exposure effect thank the Lord I
[1:04:14] put that wrote that down when I was
[1:04:15] studying something ages ago I'd never
[1:04:17] want to remember that but mere-exposure
[1:04:19] effect this is how this is a very very
[1:04:22] cunning and it's a every human none of
[1:04:25] us are exempt from the mere-exposure
[1:04:27] effect that's familiarity when you you
[1:04:31] might have heard something and not even
[1:04:32] really listen to it but then you hear it
[1:04:33] again then you hear it over here and
[1:04:35] then it places this image into the world
[1:04:38] and you use as mere exposure and in all
[1:04:41] the sudden you love it and you might
[1:04:42] have hated that thing and all of a
[1:04:44] sudden you liked it even now with real
[1:04:47] true gospel songs and real true sermons
[1:04:50] or whatever preachers or whatever it may
[1:04:52] be in righteousness the same thing you
[1:04:55] get familiar with something you like it
[1:04:56] and you might not like that you might
[1:04:58] not jell with it you might want to like
[1:05:00] that song all of a sudden you start
[1:05:01] liking that thing and you're beating
[1:05:02] your foot and you're like it's not too
[1:05:05] bad it's true now we are all made like
[1:05:09] we just made like that we're like a
[1:05:11] highly absorbent people where 90 percent
[1:05:14] or 80 something percent water apparently
[1:05:16] I don't know but anyway it doesn't feel
[1:05:18] like it fluffing around but anyway we're
[1:05:22] a lot water and water can absorb things
[1:05:24] so well you know you can take a cup of
[1:05:26] water like that and you can pour an
[1:05:30] equal volume of raro or sugar there and
[1:05:33] it doesn't actually increase in volume
[1:05:34] because of osmosis which is like the
[1:05:38] diffusion whatever it may be but it just
[1:05:40] absorbs into it and we are like that
[1:05:43] spiritually we are like that we're so
[1:05:45] impression of all we have to arrest our
[1:05:49] fault
[1:05:51] we have to take control of that garden
[1:05:52] because that garden in your mind is very
[1:05:54] fertile those children they're all
[1:05:58] sleeping they must have had a good time
[1:06:00] I'm about to close oh yeah yeah so those
[1:06:10] children are like little Gardens you
[1:06:11] know you whatever we and especially at
[1:06:14] the innocent age of innocence you know
[1:06:15] they're just you know whatever you saw
[1:06:17] in there whatever you tell them they're
[1:06:19] going to that's like a little seed
[1:06:20] that's thought and the the nature of
[1:06:23] that thought if it's evil or good will
[1:06:25] be planted in them and it will and it
[1:06:27] will it might not in my 18 years 20
[1:06:30] years and then one day they don't go
[1:06:32] because seeds just know the atmosphere
[1:06:34] that they need to to Germany right every
[1:06:36] seed has its own germination specific
[1:06:39] aspects you know like it's so it'll be a
[1:06:41] certain amount of humidity a certain
[1:06:43] amount of light a certain amount of rain
[1:06:44] a certain amount of something in the
[1:06:46] atmosphere and the soil all of a sudden
[1:06:48] comes up and we like that so just what
[1:06:52] use things on you become don't let the
[1:06:56] devil lead you down garden paths because
[1:07:00] I see it so often my goodness how many
[1:07:04] people struggle because they think
[1:07:06] stupid thoughts not that they generate
[1:07:08] them but they are through the power of
[1:07:10] suggestion through demonic study of
[1:07:12] their life demons study you they study
[1:07:15] you and they wait and then they plant a
[1:07:17] thing they fire forts at you they fire
[1:07:19] all these things at you to see what you
[1:07:22] do and people just constantly thinking
[1:07:25] about these thing they put there and
[1:07:26] they start to stew on them and they
[1:07:27] started because when a thought comes to
[1:07:29] you it doesn't just come as information
[1:07:31] that's just flat it comes with an
[1:07:33] emotion it comes with a feeling it comes
[1:07:36] with a with a pride or it comes with a
[1:07:38] lust or it comes with a jealousy or it
[1:07:41] comes with a MELAS it comes with all
[1:07:43] these different things or of God's
[1:07:45] thoughts
[1:07:46] it comes with love comes of faith it
[1:07:48] comes with identity hallelujah now you
[1:07:51] are the judge in your life to judge
[1:07:55] those thoughts you have to make the
[1:07:57] decision am I going to entertain this
[1:07:59] this is making me feel a certain way and
[1:08:01] anyway you'll get caught up before we
[1:08:03] realize it's happening
[1:08:04] because we're just humans and we might
[1:08:06] be brushing our teeth like happens to me
[1:08:08] all the time and because I can't see it
[1:08:10] and the devil's just stop coming at me
[1:08:12] and I'm just I just go off on this big
[1:08:14] train and I end up back in the same room
[1:08:16] and my thoughts and I'm like wow I'm
[1:08:18] here and and it's negative and I go off
[1:08:21] and I just say get out of here Satan you
[1:08:23] know and you have to he's a real enemy
[1:08:26] and he will do those things to try and
[1:08:30] he what he want to do wants to get those
[1:08:32] thought and he wants to stir it up in
[1:08:33] here and then he wants it to come down
[1:08:35] into here amen
[1:08:38] I'm gonna read some stuff now because I
[1:08:40] think it's good sorry Spanish brothers
[1:08:47] but that's the opening Scripture I'll
[1:08:50] let you read that but we have to be
[1:08:53] careful what we allow okay I'm going to
[1:08:59] read one more scripture about our
[1:09:01] eternal identification oh good
[1:09:13] Oh somebody
[1:09:22] so we want to turn to 2 Corinthians 5:1
[1:09:26] says here for we know that if our
[1:09:29] earthly house of this Tabernacle we
[1:09:31] resolved we have a building of God and
[1:09:33] house not made with hands eternal in the
[1:09:36] heavens
[1:09:37] hallelujah I believe that I believe that
[1:09:41] because I'm ever going to be there but
[1:09:44] I'm already there spiritually my body my
[1:09:47] eternal being my eternal nature that's
[1:09:49] in the mind of God which is eternal that
[1:09:51] never had a beginning or an end it was
[1:09:53] right there now ask me to explain it I
[1:09:56] can't I can't explain it but it's just
[1:09:59] amazing you know Jesus when you're
[1:10:01] speaking to Nicodemus he said the son of
[1:10:03] man he's referring to myself and third
[1:10:05] person he says the son of man is talking
[1:10:06] to you but he's also inhibited so
[1:10:08] somehow it happens like that somehow if
[1:10:11] you're ever going to be there you're
[1:10:13] already there that's why you could sing
[1:10:15] together with the sons of God and shout
[1:10:18] the stars before the world was even
[1:10:20] began and if then and and the same goes
[1:10:23] for where we're going into eternity you
[1:10:26] are already there and we're and I don't
[1:10:29] know if you caught this and if you
[1:10:30] actually heard this testimony but
[1:10:33] brother Brennan's testimony when he was
[1:10:34] taken beyond the curtain of time God he
[1:10:37] was lying on his bed one day and and he
[1:10:40] was wondering about what it would be
[1:10:41] like when you died and how it would be
[1:10:43] in heaven and what form you had been in
[1:10:44] the Lord spoke being a prophet he could
[1:10:46] use him in certain ways and he said
[1:10:48] would you like to see beyond the curtain
[1:10:50] of time would you like to see an
[1:10:52] eternity and he said oh yes I would like
[1:10:54] that I mean who wouldn't like that
[1:10:55] everyone would like that people would
[1:10:57] like to do that wouldn't you I would I'd
[1:10:59] love to go and see I'd love to
[1:11:01] experience that that that what God has
[1:11:04] prepared that has never even entered the
[1:11:05] heart of man it's so glorious now he
[1:11:08] went there and he and he was and he said
[1:11:11] words cannot describe it and then when
[1:11:13] he came back and he's that now he's
[1:11:14] telling this congregation and he said to
[1:11:17] them he said I saw you all there you
[1:11:21] were there so somehow God has it so yes
[1:11:24] we are playing that time and we're in a
[1:11:26] shadow of what we really are
[1:11:28] we're like a shell this life and what we
[1:11:31] had possessed in these bodies is just a
[1:11:33] very
[1:11:34] of a shell of what we should be of what
[1:11:36] we could be and what Adam was before the
[1:11:39] fall and what Jesus was when he walked
[1:11:41] the earth and had control over
[1:11:42] everything that's what we're meant to be
[1:11:45] but we because of the fallen because
[1:11:48] Adam lost that inheritance and we lost
[1:11:49] and this flesh became sinful and started
[1:11:52] thinking all that other stuff that
[1:11:54] identification that pure true faith in
[1:11:56] identity was diminished and it got
[1:12:00] diminished right down until here we are
[1:12:01] hello trouble moves problems this turn
[1:12:06] the things that it says that it
[1:12:08] shouldn't and the stuff that comes out
[1:12:11] and there and there in the little niggly
[1:12:13] things it's all stuff to hinder and
[1:12:16] aggravate your identification but see he
[1:12:21] saw them all there that means that if
[1:12:23] you're ever going to be there you were
[1:12:26] there too and he saw you hallelujah he
[1:12:30] saw you you are already there a mess I
[1:12:34] just wanted to you know this is who you
[1:12:36] are you are not just some mistake or
[1:12:39] some just random number of humanity with
[1:12:43] chromosome but God painted your
[1:12:45] chromosomes he took your great-great
[1:12:47] great-great great-great-grandfather's
[1:12:48] and hid mothers and he put them all
[1:12:50] together without interfering a free
[1:12:52] world and he painted your chromosome and
[1:12:54] once that chromosome was exactly what he
[1:12:57] saw in his mind the very very code is so
[1:13:00] intricate and when that was exactly the
[1:13:03] way it should be then he put that
[1:13:04] predestined seed inside your life
[1:13:07] because he knew that there it is there's
[1:13:09] the image I saw this the that's machine
[1:13:12] that's who he looks like
[1:13:13] that's them all finally there but my
[1:13:17] place that seed inside let's see to
[1:13:19] receive the word for your day that see
[1:13:22] to come into connection to be children
[1:13:26] to the frequency of the voice of God for
[1:13:31] this hour not history now everyone knows
[1:13:35] the history even unbelievers it can't
[1:13:38] deny the history of Calvary because the
[1:13:41] whole civilization is centered around it
[1:13:43] while Western anyway you know you can't
[1:13:45] deny it civilization is at
[1:13:47] really centered around Calvary it sends
[1:13:50] it around the cross all birthdays all
[1:13:52] dates all calendars everything all of it
[1:13:55] the humanity basically I mean it's
[1:13:57] drifted away and the last since man
[1:13:59] started really eating from the tree of
[1:14:00] knowledge of 1948 it's really drifted
[1:14:03] away and the conscious and psyche of men
[1:14:06] especially you know there are some
[1:14:08] countries that still kind of hold to it
[1:14:09] but most countries now especially New
[1:14:12] Zealand has the the mentality general
[1:14:14] mentality is godless but society was
[1:14:18] centered right around Christianity amen
[1:14:22] well we'll just get back on track
[1:14:24] because I don't know why I went down
[1:14:26] that path but anyway we did let's go to
[1:14:28] Colossians 3:4 it says here now I want
[1:14:33] to show you something here and this may
[1:14:35] be a little deep for some this may be
[1:14:37] something that you've never heard before
[1:14:39] and and or you might have been you might
[1:14:42] have already seen it in the scriptures
[1:14:44] and your studies yourself but the
[1:14:46] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:14:48] the Lord and corporal form is two
[1:14:50] different things and if you we're not
[1:14:52] going to study right through it but I'm
[1:14:53] just going to tell you that that's what
[1:14:55] it is and the scripture is very clear
[1:14:56] that the appearing and when he talks
[1:14:58] many places we talks about the appearing
[1:15:01] and the New Testament when the Apostles
[1:15:02] are talking about this appearing to come
[1:15:05] they are talking about when Jesus comes
[1:15:08] spiritually to prepare the people for
[1:15:10] the rapture when Jesus comes and his
[1:15:12] full identity again not just partial not
[1:15:14] just a portion not just a little bit of
[1:15:17] Revelation for the theology but before
[1:15:19] person in spiritual form in the
[1:15:21] revelation of his word he would appear
[1:15:24] and and and because you know he's like
[1:15:26] the son and the son of God he appears in
[1:15:29] his full identity and we look at him and
[1:15:33] it's been preached now you're you're
[1:15:36] getting you're getting that image now
[1:15:38] the real Jesus has been preached to you
[1:15:41] the full glory of Jesus and word form in
[1:15:45] the revelation of the scripture as being
[1:15:48] ministered for so an entrance shall be
[1:15:51] ministered to you now we net as minister
[1:15:54] to you in that full image of Christ
[1:15:56] which is appearing and the last days to
[1:15:58] give you a true
[1:16:00] to build you up in the most holy faith
[1:16:02] to give you something to look at an
[1:16:06] image so you can be impressed by that
[1:16:10] image and take his identity the way you
[1:16:14] take his identity is through spiritual
[1:16:16] marriage to him spiritual marriage to
[1:16:21] the Son of God he is the bridegroom the
[1:16:24] whole scripts are centered around
[1:16:25] marriage it's centered around marriage
[1:16:28] he is the bridegroom the masculine part
[1:16:31] of God the masculine expression of God
[1:16:34] and the church is the feminine
[1:16:35] expression of God and the climax of his
[1:16:39] symphony the very crescendo of God's
[1:16:43] symphony as the full union between
[1:16:47] bridegroom and bride hallelujah and what
[1:16:51] happens there is we through marriage
[1:16:54] receive his name hallelujah and we
[1:16:57] received his seed his word the word is a
[1:17:01] concept that's a seat and inside it's
[1:17:03] got the Holy Ghost you plant there
[1:17:04] enhance you can't plant achmet you go
[1:17:06] partner in your spiritual wound and see
[1:17:09] what happens you go entertaining those
[1:17:11] thoughts amen hallelujah stop thinking
[1:17:17] about other stuff all the time that's
[1:17:20] real estate in here are you gonna give
[1:17:22] all the stuff out here in real estate
[1:17:24] and what is it going to prove you know
[1:17:26] you're trying to figure out this and
[1:17:28] trying to do that they have to figure it
[1:17:30] out for you let her bleed you all your
[1:17:33] business affairs will become a lot
[1:17:34] better all your education will become a
[1:17:36] lot better everything will become better
[1:17:39] because it's founded on something real
[1:17:41] hallelujah and he this is litmus mind
[1:17:44] being new the mind of Christ let that
[1:17:48] mind be in you hallelujah amen I love
[1:17:54] you
[1:17:55] so the appearing of Christ we're in it
[1:18:00] we are in the appearing of Christ you
[1:18:04] know there's no longer stabbing at
[1:18:05] things now
[1:18:06] it's no longer just taking a theological
[1:18:09] approach to figuring out the Bible
[1:18:13] that's not rapturing material here but
[1:18:15] it was ages where this was God used that
[1:18:19] and he inspired but he didn't really
[1:18:22] ever use the theology of men that isn't
[1:18:24] Scripture that he gave them enough for
[1:18:27] to have when he was dealing with them in
[1:18:31] that capacity you see each age in the
[1:18:34] church now I won't talk about the
[1:18:36] artists book but there's the same just a
[1:18:37] shadow fall but in the New Testament
[1:18:38] each church each age each generation it
[1:18:43] was allotted a certain portion you know
[1:18:47] they were given a certain portion and
[1:18:49] they were given a certain characteristic
[1:18:50] of God they were given a portion of
[1:18:53] Revelation and in the next one and the
[1:18:55] next one and obviously you know the
[1:18:57] story how it went down and you know the
[1:18:59] Dark Age came over and and really
[1:19:01] crippled everything even agnostic and
[1:19:05] even sciences and all that sort of
[1:19:07] crippled everything it was satanic to
[1:19:10] the expression of humanity cuz
[1:19:12] he hates humanity so the Dark Age is
[1:19:14] really what Satan wants to do to you and
[1:19:17] if you walk away from God that's what's
[1:19:19] going to happen to you you're going to
[1:19:21] be twisted up in his whip you know one
[1:19:25] smarter than him in the flesh and if you
[1:19:27] walk away from God he's think on those
[1:19:29] things and you start getting caught up
[1:19:30] and all his thoughts all the time in you
[1:19:32] and and you're not using your sword your
[1:19:35] authority to cast them down you get
[1:19:38] caught up in those things and the Dark
[1:19:40] Ages is what will happen in your life
[1:19:42] you'll have your own Dark Age and I mean
[1:19:44] you know we do have that day sometimes
[1:19:46] where it's hard and you get down
[1:19:48] sometimes you get depressed and
[1:19:49] sometimes you get frustrated and
[1:19:51] sometimes you've got no patience just
[1:19:54] too much sometimes there's all these
[1:19:56] things but that's just one day here and
[1:20:00] then but if you let the devil just take
[1:20:02] rampant control what you sort of Dark
[1:20:05] Ages will happen in your own life that's
[1:20:08] what he wants to do to humans he hates
[1:20:10] humanity he wants to press them down but
[1:20:12] then God says now I'm not gonna let you
[1:20:14] do that anymore and I'm going to give
[1:20:19] him I'm gonna now you're not he had a
[1:20:21] revelation you don't have the service
[1:20:23] Catholicism to get saved you don't have
[1:20:25] the cross
[1:20:26] and crawled and confessed all these
[1:20:28] priests and two sisters Annalee rubbish
[1:20:30] you can just believe that he died for
[1:20:33] you and that was enough and they came
[1:20:37] out of it they were liberated by faith
[1:20:39] and they were justified
[1:20:40] they had a portion they had a push then
[1:20:43] had everything that Jesus was yet they
[1:20:46] had Jesus they had a spirit because the
[1:20:48] spirit was telling them that but then he
[1:20:51] wanted to give some more so he gave more
[1:20:53] to John Wesley and what of the the age
[1:20:55] of holy missing them holding this
[1:20:56] movement and developed them develop then
[1:20:58] he kept giving them portions of his word
[1:21:00] until finally in the last days it was
[1:21:05] time for his appearing because he needed
[1:21:07] a church to reflect him not reflect some
[1:21:10] school of theology not reflect 90% of
[1:21:13] truths and meant 10% of Catholicism and
[1:21:16] some man's ideas but 100% the identity
[1:21:21] of Jesus Christ to be revealed the only
[1:21:24] way he can do that is by a word prophet
[1:21:26] like Moses that's why he's into Gentile
[1:21:28] prophet it's the only way there's no
[1:21:30] other way for God to declare the
[1:21:32] fullness of himself through theology
[1:21:34] through some hierarchy that's figuring
[1:21:36] it out they did their thing they had
[1:21:38] their time but the last days for the
[1:21:40] appearing of Jesus Christ he had to use
[1:21:43] a word born prophet that was none of
[1:21:47] their thoughts that was all God's
[1:21:48] thoughts through the mouthpiece that's
[1:21:50] how a prophet office works you know
[1:21:52] there's minor prophets and gifts of
[1:21:54] prophecy in the church is that God or is
[1:21:58] that then it's God speaking but you see
[1:22:01] that's just a minor gift it's a gift of
[1:22:03] prophecy they give you a word they give
[1:22:05] you knowledge they give you wisdom won't
[1:22:07] they give you those things but they're
[1:22:08] not actual word born prophets like Moses
[1:22:11] that lead a generation from one thing
[1:22:14] into another God needs for the most you
[1:22:17] think about this this event with the
[1:22:21] appearing of Christ as one of the most
[1:22:24] major events in history
[1:22:26] how could man and his hierarchy and
[1:22:29] theology figure that out
[1:22:30] it takes the only way to do it is by
[1:22:33] God's alone Jesus Christ Himself
[1:22:35] speaking and the only way you can speak
[1:22:38] Angela and take a peep 'l as through the
[1:22:41] office of a prophet that's why we read
[1:22:42] an Amos 3:7 it says that the Lord God
[1:22:45] will do nothing except he revealeth his
[1:22:47] secrets to a servants the prophets amen
[1:22:52] hallelujah well you know I get quite a
[1:22:55] hit myself so here we read now in
[1:22:59] Colossians about we're just going to
[1:23:01] read a couple of things about the
[1:23:02] appearing just the appearing is so that
[1:23:06] you can reflect them I'm trying to get
[1:23:09] to that they're just never time to
[1:23:10] happen the appearing is so that you can
[1:23:13] reflect them so that you can behold the
[1:23:17] true image of the Son of God and go I
[1:23:20] like that I'm impressed by that that
[1:23:22] affects my life I love that nature I
[1:23:24] love that life I love that character I
[1:23:27] choose to be identified with that who
[1:23:29] chooses to be identified with the Son of
[1:23:32] God the real son of God nothing to do
[1:23:36] with men nothing to do a theology
[1:23:38] nothing to do with intellectualism but
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ and the in time would
[1:23:43] appear to his church to say Here I am
[1:23:46] others mean look in my face hallelujah
[1:23:49] this is Who I am reflect me you are the
[1:23:52] moon and I am the Sun hallelujah the
[1:23:55] moon reflects the light of the Sun does
[1:23:58] it produce its own life you're the moon
[1:24:00] you're here to reflect his light in the
[1:24:03] night evening time hallelujah
[1:24:06] I'll give me it so that is the purpose
[1:24:08] now I get I've got it out there's to
[1:24:11] reflect them to your identity there's
[1:24:14] been reflecting him there's actually a
[1:24:16] beautiful scripture write this down if
[1:24:18] you can Isaiah 30 verse 26 Isaiah 30
[1:24:23] let's just read them sorry my
[1:24:25] spanish-speaking brethren but I don't
[1:24:27] have this on the projector but Isaiah 30
[1:24:31] verse 26
[1:24:38] this is one of my most favorite passages
[1:24:41] of scripture in the Bible because it
[1:24:45] tells me about my life it tells me
[1:24:47] what's happening now it says here
[1:24:50] moreover the light of the Moon hello
[1:24:53] moon she'll be as the light of the Sun
[1:24:58] and the light of the Sun shall be
[1:25:01] stepping forward as the light of seven
[1:25:04] days in the day that the Lord binds up
[1:25:06] the breech of his people and heals the
[1:25:08] stroke of their wound this is the
[1:25:11] message that you have received this is
[1:25:14] that the very heart of God right now
[1:25:19] he you see what I'm telling you about
[1:25:22] the all of these ages have received a
[1:25:24] portion this seven church ages men don't
[1:25:28] even look at my fingers but there's
[1:25:29] seven church ages seven days seven seven
[1:25:34] expressions of God two different ages
[1:25:36] you know and all of them had a portion
[1:25:39] of truth the first church had a lot of
[1:25:41] the truth most of it he reserved one
[1:25:43] thing one small portion because if they
[1:25:46] had that they would have had a wretched
[1:25:47] him you see so he reserved from the
[1:25:51] first church that book that was sealed
[1:25:53] seven seals it stayed sealed for him it
[1:25:57] stayed in the hands of the Father for
[1:25:58] him even though their sins was paid for
[1:26:00] and their Jesus was leading the church
[1:26:01] he held that back because then he said
[1:26:03] to Daniel Daniel seal it up until the
[1:26:05] end time seal that up until the time of
[1:26:09] the end when knowledge shall increase
[1:26:10] when mansions eat from the tree of
[1:26:12] knowledge of it more then open it
[1:26:14] because that all that all that all that
[1:26:16] all seal away my bride it'll give her
[1:26:19] what she needs to be raptured Amen so
[1:26:26] here you are and all those seven days
[1:26:31] all the like all those the portioned
[1:26:34] allotments of word that came to all
[1:26:36] those generations through the seven
[1:26:37] Church ages has been gathered together
[1:26:39] under a prophetic ministry to preach all
[1:26:42] the truth to you so that you would shine
[1:26:45] like the brightness of the Sun as the
[1:26:48] light of seven days and
[1:26:51] one day put that on your fridge and say
[1:26:53] that's me that's me I'm the moon I'm
[1:26:57] reflecting the light of the Sun and the
[1:26:59] Sun has decided now it's her season that
[1:27:02] he's going to shine everything you know
[1:27:04] what happens when he shines all seven
[1:27:06] colors of the rainbow at once
[1:27:07] who knows what color it is white all
[1:27:12] seven colors together as white amen so
[1:27:16] you see the first to attend to receiver
[1:27:18] color second third fourth fifth sixth
[1:27:20] right to the pinna costal and
[1:27:21] charismatic move pin across the motion I
[1:27:23] say now these colors but then he would
[1:27:26] get it all together and he would shine
[1:27:28] at all he would what's the word
[1:27:31] consolidate he will consolidate all of
[1:27:35] it so that the entity the seed of that
[1:27:38] word would be the appearing of Christ
[1:27:40] and he would preach it to you and he
[1:27:42] would say to you arise and shine for
[1:27:45] your light has come and the glory of the
[1:27:47] lord has risen upon thee and the light
[1:27:49] would shine in the dark places of your
[1:27:51] heart and the day star himself would
[1:27:54] arise in your heart amen what do you
[1:27:57] think happened to Mary when Mary had the
[1:28:00] angelic visitation and he preached her a
[1:28:03] message when the coming of the Lord
[1:28:06] began didn't it and he'll I just started
[1:28:10] the coming that's physically because he
[1:28:12] had to pay for the sins now the start of
[1:28:15] the coming happens in you hallelujah
[1:28:18] that's how it works because you've
[1:28:22] received the same angels message because
[1:28:24] Gabriel announced the message of the
[1:28:27] first coming Gabriel announced the
[1:28:29] message of the second coming it's the
[1:28:31] same thing God just repeats this history
[1:28:33] but this time he didn't need a corporal
[1:28:35] lamb Jesus Christ to pay for our sins
[1:28:39] because they're paid for so he just you
[1:28:42] received escaped the fullness of his
[1:28:43] word and the same son of God spiritually
[1:28:47] now without a physical body inside you a
[1:28:50] spiritual body the appearance of him is
[1:28:54] born in here coming of the Lord has just
[1:28:57] started there's a couple little cells
[1:28:59] inside just like Mary coming Oh Lord it
[1:29:02] began it was already there specific
[1:29:04] there you see these things are so humble
[1:29:07] so small seemingly they're actually big
[1:29:10] great things God does great things very
[1:29:12] quietly he does great things that man
[1:29:15] doesn't even realize the whole church
[1:29:17] world doesn't even realize what's going
[1:29:18] on you know there's so many they're
[1:29:23] going about pomp and they've got their
[1:29:24] whole thing will draw down this is how
[1:29:27] it's going to happen you know God's
[1:29:28] gonna open the skies and he's gonna roll
[1:29:30] out the cup he's going to destroy the
[1:29:32] Roman Catholics he's gonna destroy the
[1:29:33] the beasting and a destroy all the stuff
[1:29:36] it's happening already
[1:29:38] Alleluia it's already happening yes
[1:29:43] there is all going to happen but we're
[1:29:45] gonna be with them
[1:29:45] Alleluia you do realize that that the
[1:29:49] second coming when he comes in his body
[1:29:50] hello
[1:29:51] who's going to be on white horses with
[1:29:53] them who's going to be there with him
[1:29:55] Alleluia so his appearing is coming so
[1:29:58] that you can actually be part of the
[1:30:00] coming you're part of the coming of the
[1:30:03] Lord
[1:30:03] cuz you're his wife and he spent the
[1:30:06] last 2000 years building the real church
[1:30:09] building building building building and
[1:30:11] there's been a a bride put away in every
[1:30:13] age in one day they're all going to
[1:30:15] gather together and we're going to be
[1:30:16] caught up to meet him in the air and
[1:30:18] then we're going to ride out we're gonna
[1:30:19] spend three and a half years and supper
[1:30:21] and we're gonna rejoice we're gonna talk
[1:30:23] to each other share testimonies whatever
[1:30:25] happens I don't know it's gonna be
[1:30:26] amazing and then we're gonna go back
[1:30:28] with them and the second coming more
[1:30:29] actually that everyone actually is
[1:30:31] really the general consensus sees will
[1:30:35] be with them amen I know that's probably
[1:30:39] a lot to swallow but that's exactly what
[1:30:41] it is it's perfectly scriptural lujah
[1:30:45] now that there when I preach these
[1:30:48] things you know this is the image of the
[1:30:49] Son of God
[1:30:50] this is the true Word of God when you
[1:30:52] can see those things it's going to
[1:30:54] produce life because you're seeing
[1:30:57] reality this is your natural super
[1:31:00] natural habitat this is where you're
[1:31:02] meant to look when you realize these
[1:31:04] things what it does is it unclips all
[1:31:05] the stuff that you know you our own
[1:31:08] ideas and Satan's ideas and all those
[1:31:09] ideas that just it just undoes them
[1:31:12] because the Word of God is this
[1:31:15] and this is how it's happening this is
[1:31:17] what is happening front page news and
[1:31:19] you go well okay yeah and you start to
[1:31:21] live and then you start to identify with
[1:31:23] them you start to react and act and
[1:31:25] conduct yourself according to the front
[1:31:27] page news amen
[1:31:29] if there's an earthquake on the front
[1:31:30] page you're going to prepare for an
[1:31:31] earthquake but I'm telling you now that
[1:31:34] the appearing of the Lord is here and
[1:31:35] and he's appearing inside you do you
[1:31:39] know Peter says that one day you know
[1:31:41] light won't and the dawning of the day
[1:31:44] you know and they're dawning day or I'll
[1:31:46] read it to Peter 2nd Peter 1
[1:32:04] second peter 1:16
[1:32:16] this for we have not followed cunningly
[1:32:19] devised fables now fable is like it can
[1:32:23] be a story that's you know you know that
[1:32:26] that real kind of nice preaching that
[1:32:29] you're here and that makes you feel real
[1:32:30] good but it's just a story
[1:32:32] they've just told you a story about some
[1:32:34] guy and you get a nice fluffy feeling
[1:32:36] but there's no real substance there's no
[1:32:38] real prophecy inside there there's not
[1:32:40] that's not the Word of God
[1:32:42] well that's very rampant around that's
[1:32:44] very common you know and motivational
[1:32:47] speakers and that they use fables people
[1:32:51] that go people that are called to the
[1:32:52] ministry and go preach and learn how to
[1:32:54] preach in some theological school they
[1:32:57] just they they'll tell you all these
[1:32:58] fables and things because there's no
[1:33:00] real prophetic element inside them
[1:33:03] that's expressing the pinpointing where
[1:33:05] you are where are you in the Bible where
[1:33:08] is it happening what's the front page of
[1:33:10] God's news because that's the news you
[1:33:12] really need to know because then you
[1:33:13] will conduct yourself according to your
[1:33:15] spiritual habitation so here we have not
[1:33:20] followed cunningly devised fables when
[1:33:22] we made known unto you the power and
[1:33:23] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but what
[1:33:26] I witnesses of His Majesty for he
[1:33:30] received from God the Father honor and
[1:33:32] glory where they came such a voice to
[1:33:34] him from the excellent glory this is my
[1:33:36] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:33:38] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:33:41] heard when we were with them in the holy
[1:33:43] mount we have also a more sure word of
[1:33:47] prophecy whereunto you do well that you
[1:33:50] take heed as unto a light that shines in
[1:33:53] a dark place until see the light of God
[1:33:59] started shining the gospel went out and
[1:34:02] it keeps shining and dark shining in
[1:34:05] this dark world shining in your dark
[1:34:07] world shining in the darkness and here
[1:34:09] shining shining shining shining until
[1:34:13] the day dawns and the day star arise in
[1:34:18] your heart that doesn't happen until the
[1:34:22] days about the door it doesn't happen
[1:34:24] until the new day is about to come open
[1:34:27] and that is in this day because we Trent
[1:34:30] we are in a convergence of dimensions we
[1:34:34] are in a convergence where time and
[1:34:37] eternity is blending and we're going to
[1:34:39] go into eternity we're actually in that
[1:34:41] face of of existence now this is why
[1:34:44] everything is happening the way it is
[1:34:46] that's why there's soddom conditions out
[1:34:48] there that's why it's become the way it
[1:34:49] is because prophecy said it would that's
[1:34:52] why it's there this is why Jesus
[1:34:54] described the world we live in now as
[1:34:56] exactly like it wasn't Sodom in the
[1:34:57] moral the same thing as the same
[1:34:59] condition as my knowledge has increased
[1:35:00] the times that about and Dan who
[1:35:03] everything is here the prophecies is
[1:35:04] here the Pope was taking his preeminent
[1:35:07] position he's loved by the world even
[1:35:09] the Muslims and all of that are starting
[1:35:10] to love him he's actually going to solve
[1:35:12] some problems and he will become the
[1:35:14] savior of the society whether it's this
[1:35:17] one or the next one or whatever he will
[1:35:19] and its gearing that way it's been
[1:35:21] gearing that way since Vatican 2 in 1964
[1:35:23] when the Pope finally left and went to
[1:35:26] Jerusalem with Rome and we visited
[1:35:27] Jerusalem and there was the total
[1:35:29] eclipse and it showed the seven Church
[1:35:31] ages of the Moon and they brother
[1:35:32] branham preached the seven church ages
[1:35:34] then in the revelation chapter five
[1:35:35] sermon that he preached he's sharing
[1:35:37] these things and the Holy Ghost came
[1:35:39] down into the room and shown the very
[1:35:41] images on they had a predictor of 1964
[1:35:45] and it was a divine projector amen so
[1:35:48] you see the technology was already there
[1:35:50] hallelujah God vindicated that his
[1:35:53] prophet was telling the truth and here
[1:35:55] was a total eclipse because the Pope was
[1:35:57] wanting to go to Jerusalem and he did
[1:35:59] now that Vatican 2 started the dialogue
[1:36:03] between Rome and the world to actually
[1:36:05] income in us and come together and form
[1:36:08] the image and form the mark of the beast
[1:36:11] and form all those things together to
[1:36:13] control a one-world government
[1:36:15] yep that's right but in the same time
[1:36:22] and this darkness all the darkness is
[1:36:25] here light ash on and the day is dawning
[1:36:27] and we're dawning into a new day now
[1:36:29] there is a new day and it's happening
[1:36:32] inside here because you've received an
[1:36:35] Angels miss
[1:36:37] hallelujah you are Mary hello Mary Lou
[1:36:46] I'm gonna get back to my notes now I
[1:36:49] want to give the spanish-speaking
[1:36:51] brothers we read this motto when Christ
[1:36:58] who has a life I'll read it now when
[1:37:01] Christ who is our life shall appear then
[1:37:03] shall we also appear with him in glory
[1:37:06] see there's an appearing to be for there
[1:37:08] to be an appearing because it's Sun and
[1:37:10] Moon its reflection amen mortify
[1:37:14] therefore your members this flesh which
[1:37:17] are upon the earth fornication
[1:37:18] uncleanness and ordinance affection evil
[1:37:21] concupiscence and covetousness which is
[1:37:23] idolatry now you only multiply those
[1:37:26] things by the Holy Ghost by the Spirit
[1:37:28] of God it's in Romans 8 for which things
[1:37:33] sake the wrath of God come upon the
[1:37:35] children of disobedience in the which he
[1:37:37] also walked sometime when you lived in
[1:37:40] them 1 John 3:2 beloved now we are the
[1:37:43] sons of God now not we shall be now we
[1:37:48] are the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:37:50] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:37:53] when he shall appear
[1:37:55] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:37:58] him for we shall see him as he is
[1:38:02] hallelujah and she was so happy that and
[1:38:05] so glad that he would reveal himself
[1:38:08] like this we are sitting under four
[1:38:12] gospel truth all the time it's this is
[1:38:16] this is Jesus he's saying Here I am I'm
[1:38:19] appearing to you so you can see me and
[1:38:22] carry yourself with an excellent spirit
[1:38:25] Daniel carried himself he was a prophet
[1:38:28] he carried himself with an excellent
[1:38:29] spirit in the midst of Babylon we are in
[1:38:32] Mystery Babylon carry yourself with an
[1:38:35] excellent spirit and I know and
[1:38:37] regarding thoughts you know your spirit
[1:38:40] your your subconscious and all the
[1:38:43] thoughts and everything what's going on
[1:38:44] take control of it
[1:38:47] Solomon says he says mister actually
[1:38:56] proverbs 25 28 he that has no rule over
[1:39:00] his own spirit as like a city that is
[1:39:02] broken down and without walls you have
[1:39:05] to take control of your thought life
[1:39:08] you're called to take control of your
[1:39:10] thought life because you are a free
[1:39:12] moral agent you have a free will you
[1:39:15] choose what thoughts are might know to
[1:39:17] think on what am I going to think about
[1:39:19] what am I going to entertain what am I
[1:39:21] going to allow in here and in here and
[1:39:23] what am I going to allow out of here
[1:39:25] God gives us the temperance to make the
[1:39:29] right decisions but our decisions should
[1:39:31] be based on righteousness and not on
[1:39:34] selfishness not on the preservation of
[1:39:38] our own interests because eternal life
[1:39:41] is living for others but you shouldn't
[1:39:46] consciously icon Allah for others today
[1:39:48] I've got to look for others you know it
[1:39:49] should just be flowing out of your belly
[1:39:51] like the rivers of living water
[1:39:53] you understand you out flow fountain
[1:39:58] beautiful and every men one John 3:3 and
[1:40:04] every man that has this sari and every
[1:40:10] man that has this hope in him purifies
[1:40:13] himself even as he is pure you know this
[1:40:17] was a as hope as as an anticipation was
[1:40:21] a pleasure its anticipation with
[1:40:24] pleasure Bible hope is different from
[1:40:26] human hope human hope is like can I hope
[1:40:28] I won the lotto but Bible hope is
[1:40:30] different but I will hope is based on a
[1:40:32] promise and you you've got an
[1:40:35] anticipation and some pleasure you're
[1:40:37] waiting on him in one day the faith
[1:40:40] comes and he reveals it to you faith is
[1:40:47] the substance of things anticipated
[1:40:50] hopeful they would hope is anticipation
[1:40:53] with please
[1:40:55] and faith has given to you that you see
[1:40:57] your approach as an approach of
[1:40:59] anticipation with pleasure you approach
[1:41:02] the promises with please don't goddess
[1:41:05] you better prove it to me or I all you
[1:41:08] just sit there in light because it
[1:41:09] hasn't happened you don't feel anything
[1:41:10] you just unbelief you just let the devil
[1:41:13] you just start entertaining the devil's
[1:41:14] thoughts real it's not real look look at
[1:41:18] that look at this look at everybody else
[1:41:19] look it even got that just cast all that
[1:41:23] stuff down you know all that is is to
[1:41:25] dissuade you to distract you from hoping
[1:41:28] real hope Bible hope because those
[1:41:31] promises are sure and stedfast approach
[1:41:33] them with hope approach them with faith
[1:41:35] but approach them with anticipation with
[1:41:37] pleasure because when I say hope I'm not
[1:41:40] talking about human hope I'm talking
[1:41:42] about real anticipation which is a human
[1:41:45] faith that's a it's an expression of
[1:41:47] belief I believe that and then one day
[1:41:51] the revelation comes
[1:41:53] it could come straightaway the moment
[1:41:54] you pray sometimes it's just there and
[1:41:56] you have it and you believe it in a
[1:41:58] manifest instantly and it's a miraculous
[1:42:00] event takes place I've seen it we've
[1:42:03] seen there actually I want to share a
[1:42:04] little testimony so brother Malcolm some
[1:42:07] amazing testimony actually so he was
[1:42:09] about he's just preparing and rather
[1:42:12] Andrew Donaldson was going to preach up
[1:42:16] there and he brother Malcolm was just
[1:42:18] giving his dialogue at the start and he
[1:42:22] was about to welcome him up to preach
[1:42:23] and then sister ray I don't actually
[1:42:27] know who she is but I was telling me
[1:42:29] about it she died she just keeled over
[1:42:32] and the seat and died and no poles have
[1:42:34] gone we're cold and the congregation was
[1:42:36] starting to get a bit but like worried
[1:42:39] and brother Malcolm says stop no no
[1:42:41] let's just pray and it's just sing
[1:42:43] so they started singing and they praying
[1:42:46] and he waited for the atmosphere then he
[1:42:47] prayed for her and she raised up from
[1:42:49] the deep and she raised up and God gave
[1:42:52] her life bang and she walked they called
[1:42:55] the ambulance anyway to check her out
[1:42:56] and she walked up to the emmalin's after
[1:42:58] being dead energy for some minute so see
[1:43:02] God still raises the dead
[1:43:03] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:43:06] forever amen and and and they've been
[1:43:09] preaching about these things preaching
[1:43:11] about the inheritance we have thus
[1:43:13] inheritance we had the spoken word and
[1:43:15] it's and it's a mature form it's just
[1:43:17] small but it will come into full
[1:43:19] manifestations Alleluia when the
[1:43:22] pressure comes on
[1:43:30] so praise the Lord amen
[1:43:40] in the Webster dictionary the definition
[1:43:43] of identity I thought this was quite
[1:43:47] actually it was actually quite good I
[1:43:48] like this is for different pacifists and
[1:43:51] it says here the distinguishing
[1:43:55] character of a personality or an
[1:43:57] individual of an individual
[1:43:58] individuality the relation established
[1:44:03] by psychological identification what you
[1:44:07] think on what do you identify for within
[1:44:10] here do you identify with that I'm a son
[1:44:13] of God and that I believe and that Jesus
[1:44:16] Christ is good to me and I love them and
[1:44:17] he's kind to me and he keeps his word
[1:44:20] and you're worshipping Him and you
[1:44:22] adoring him in your thinking on what
[1:44:24] he's showing you in the scriptures
[1:44:25] what are you identified with
[1:44:28] psychological identification so there is
[1:44:31] a psychological element to this the
[1:44:35] condition of being the same with
[1:44:37] something described or asserted so you
[1:44:39] see well I think I like having that
[1:44:41] condition it's one condition that I like
[1:44:44] being the same of what the preachers
[1:44:46] preaching to me Amen what that preachers
[1:44:49] preaching I am there Amen I thought
[1:44:53] that's really good I enjoyed that
[1:44:54] ah and I find that myself thinking man a
[1:44:58] lot when I'm hearing the preaching you
[1:44:59] know and I'm sitting there listening I'm
[1:45:01] like yes that's me I know that I believe
[1:45:04] that I can identify with that and I do
[1:45:08] identify with that and I opened the gate
[1:45:10] of joy in my life
[1:45:12] you know when you enjoy something you
[1:45:13] really are leading that and an effect
[1:45:16] thing has rooted in hell you're letting
[1:45:18] hell if you're enjoying it you know
[1:45:21] something's you know and I'm glad that
[1:45:23] it's like that because I don't enjoy the
[1:45:25] music in the mall I hate it if i sat
[1:45:28] there and started enjoying that that
[1:45:29] spirit of that lust or that rock star or
[1:45:32] that pop star which was absolute junk
[1:45:35] man that stuff is just so it just makes
[1:45:37] me tired like I get tired you own the
[1:45:39] whole time in the mall
[1:45:40] hey I'm like going man what's up with
[1:45:42] this place it makes me tired
[1:45:43] it's just must be just subconsciously
[1:45:46] stressful anyway I'm sitting in the arm
[1:45:48] so tired
[1:45:49] and this music player I think you've met
[1:45:51] I do not
[1:45:52] enjoy this but I know and I've studied
[1:45:54] this out that when you enjoy something
[1:45:56] when you actually open up to it and you
[1:45:58] enjoy it it really keep becomes part of
[1:46:01] you you know that when you sit there and
[1:46:04] you really an impressive it's like you
[1:46:06] open up the aperture of your heart and
[1:46:09] you just let it go
[1:46:11] shine that image like on the on a camera
[1:46:14] burns that oh that's right unto you
[1:46:17] sizzling hot fire the spirit behind it
[1:46:24] now spirit behind it so don't you be
[1:46:31] careful what you enjoy amen
[1:46:34] careful what you open your aperture
[1:46:37] sorry if you're not a photographer the
[1:46:39] apertures like the shutter on the camera
[1:46:42] the measurement of the shutter or
[1:46:44] something but anyway it's a thing that
[1:46:45] opens up and it instantly goes it and it
[1:46:49] just impresses the image of the light
[1:46:51] just touches it now your eyes you know
[1:46:55] it's like the epitome and they open they
[1:46:58] dilate you know when you're in the dark
[1:47:00] and it's just this type you know when
[1:47:02] you're in the dark and your eyes wide
[1:47:03] open it makes you more open and
[1:47:05] susceptible to demonic health that's why
[1:47:09] the demons love darkness that's why all
[1:47:10] the people go out at night to night
[1:47:12] clubs because it's where the demons
[1:47:13] starts are really role that's why
[1:47:15] there's so much trouble this fights this
[1:47:17] anger is hatred because when people get
[1:47:19] drunk they open up an aperture for Satan
[1:47:22] to start operating through them I
[1:47:24] remember when I was on that stuff and if
[1:47:26] I had vodka mana life I didn't even know
[1:47:30] what happened the whole night was gone
[1:47:32] blackout and I'd get told the stories in
[1:47:34] the morning and then demon took over my
[1:47:36] life completely and the stuff that I did
[1:47:40] was you wouldn't want to know honestly I
[1:47:43] don't even know I get told it but I
[1:47:45] don't even it's just crazy stuff because
[1:47:47] of you're opening yourself up and that's
[1:47:50] one that's world opens up to - be
[1:47:53] careful what you enjoy sameness of
[1:47:57] essential or generic character in
[1:48:00] different
[1:48:00] instances but this is the one I really
[1:48:02] like - it's one here sameness and all
[1:48:06] the sudden out the definition of
[1:48:08] identity sameness in all their
[1:48:11] constitutes the objective there is the
[1:48:14] practical the really just the the
[1:48:19] objective reality of a thing so the
[1:48:23] sameness and all that constitutes the
[1:48:26] objective reality of a thing oneness
[1:48:29] Alleluia that's my identity oneness I
[1:48:33] want this is my I want and I am
[1:48:37] hallelujah one with him that we have
[1:48:42] been made one not Shelby we are one
[1:48:46] because the blood was sufficient the
[1:48:49] blood paid at all the the weight of the
[1:48:52] Holy of Holies was open the veil was
[1:48:54] ripped now we know a religious spirit
[1:48:57] and come and try and sew that back up
[1:48:58] and give you a seven steps to approach
[1:49:00] it but it's really you just walk home me
[1:49:03] how I loo you you open up now you see I
[1:49:08] see don't open your aperture to those
[1:49:09] things you know I want you to open your
[1:49:11] aperture to Jesus Christ you do that
[1:49:15] approach him with that way approach him
[1:49:18] of joy I walk into his gates with
[1:49:20] Thanksgiving in his heart I will enter
[1:49:22] his courts with praise this is in Psalm
[1:49:24] 16:11 you will Lord you will show me the
[1:49:28] path of life in your presence is
[1:49:32] fullness of joy and at thy right hand
[1:49:35] there are pleasures or open the aperture
[1:49:39] of your heart I've been a writer and let
[1:49:44] me image that as being ministered to you
[1:49:46] and press you and enjoy it sit there and
[1:49:51] enjoy the word and let it brand the very
[1:49:57] image of the Son of God in you and see
[1:50:00] what happens see why down the walls let
[1:50:05] go of those other thoughts that you're
[1:50:06] thinking about all those things that's
[1:50:08] going on there train lay it down
[1:50:11] and let those thoughts come in and let
[1:50:14] your heart continually worship let it
[1:50:18] continually flow praise now I know
[1:50:22] that's not a that's the that's ideology
[1:50:24] now it's idealism should I say there is
[1:50:27] an ideal idyllic condition and we want
[1:50:30] that and we all want that I'm just
[1:50:32] reminding you I'm just reminding you
[1:50:35] that this is important and I believe
[1:50:37] it's more important now than ever before
[1:50:39] because we are approaching the the very
[1:50:43] convergence of dimensions sorry for the
[1:50:45] big words we are approaching the very
[1:50:48] translation hallelujah
[1:50:50] we're all of these things and everything
[1:50:52] is just for coming it's just this world
[1:50:55] is boring it's boring it's got no life
[1:50:59] in it all the life being sucked out
[1:51:02] it's suffered entropy it's suffered all
[1:51:05] of the condition that if it was is just
[1:51:08] being absorbed and you are absorbing the
[1:51:12] order you're absorbing the very
[1:51:15] condition of order because he's bringing
[1:51:18] their image into his church he's
[1:51:20] bringing that order into his bride so
[1:51:23] all the order that there is left because
[1:51:25] there's their energy now holds things
[1:51:27] into order energy holds things into a
[1:51:30] substance
[1:51:30] now all that energy that ever was is
[1:51:33] already there and it doesn't deplete it
[1:51:35] doesn't the energy in general and the
[1:51:38] earth it's as any created in the
[1:51:41] beginning when you see like create the
[1:51:42] work work of energy I create this work
[1:51:45] and it's there and it will work and it
[1:51:47] will go around and systems and go from
[1:51:48] one thing to the next but energy is that
[1:51:50] it's just there you are sucking up all
[1:51:54] the spiritual energy that this world has
[1:51:56] because you are coming into the perfect
[1:51:58] order of the bride you are coming into
[1:52:01] the perfect order of God's masterpiece
[1:52:04] hallelujah all the order that they could
[1:52:07] be is coming into you you are causing
[1:52:09] all of the stuff to go on because you're
[1:52:13] fulfilling scripture not by trying to it
[1:52:18] just happening because
[1:52:19] season this is the season where his wife
[1:52:23] will be manifesting this is the season
[1:52:26] where she would shine like them
[1:52:28] hallelujah
[1:52:29] not because you're any better than
[1:52:30] anyone else just because you are who you
[1:52:34] are
[1:52:34] amen has grace do not struggle it says
[1:52:39] you know only thing you can do is take
[1:52:42] up your sword and cut down those other
[1:52:43] thoughts and just start small Lord I
[1:52:47] want to think about just ask him this is
[1:52:50] as simple as asking him to help you know
[1:52:53] because sometimes and I think about it
[1:52:55] myself
[1:52:56] I've got businesses to run I've got
[1:52:58] people and this and that and kill
[1:53:00] children everything so there's all these
[1:53:01] thoughts always going on and
[1:53:02] responsibilities and stuff happening and
[1:53:04] negative things that make me angry and
[1:53:06] whatever it may be all that stuff
[1:53:08] happening but lord I ask let my heart
[1:53:13] worship through it'll let me help me
[1:53:19] Jesus to stay in an attitude of worship
[1:53:22] oh my imaginary wouldn't that be great
[1:53:25] every here just in that atmosphere I
[1:53:28] just need to read these things they I
[1:53:30] have to read the stuff because I don't
[1:53:32] want to I don't want to deprive you of
[1:53:34] what is in here because there's such
[1:53:37] good quotes in scriptures and I just
[1:53:39] want to let the Lord's word speak so as
[1:53:41] I read these things you just absorb it
[1:53:44] enjoy it
[1:53:53] I'm going to now just hit that the
[1:53:56] section about the paths of four because
[1:54:00] the the paths that you are led down a
[1:54:03] four part who knows who's been down a
[1:54:06] footpath before you know you go right
[1:54:10] down on those things and up and out left
[1:54:12] and right and then you think yourself
[1:54:15] right back into you the room who you're
[1:54:16] and then you go mad I'm in this room I
[1:54:18] don't know if you do that but I do that
[1:54:20] more so when I was a child but I'd still
[1:54:23] do that sometimes
[1:54:23] ever ever does everyone understand what
[1:54:26] I mean it's quite freaky actually you
[1:54:28] know you think yourself right down and
[1:54:30] you're going off and all of a sudden
[1:54:31] you're thinking about the room that
[1:54:33] you're in and you're in it and you're
[1:54:34] like wow just bite out of it it's like
[1:54:37] coming into a vision or something you
[1:54:38] know know as a man thinketh eat they are
[1:54:45] not the bread of him that has an evil
[1:54:47] eye neither desire thou his dainty meats
[1:54:51] for as he thinks in his heart so as he
[1:55:01] thinks in his heart so is he
[1:55:07] you are no higher than your thoughts
[1:55:10] really hallelujah and this is how the
[1:55:16] enemy can hinder your life this is the
[1:55:19] only way he can do it because Calvary
[1:55:22] brokers back I love saying that I love
[1:55:26] saying that Satan's that defeated being
[1:55:27] that he has no power and all his chains
[1:55:30] are made out of burger rings hallelujah
[1:55:33] they're nothing they're just a lie he
[1:55:37] can lie a chain over you but it's really
[1:55:39] a lie he doesn't have any power all the
[1:55:45] only way he can get you as by a lie the
[1:55:47] strength of his hold on you as a lie
[1:55:49] hallelujah it makes me feel so good to
[1:55:52] say that
[1:55:52] hallelujah he is an absolute defeated
[1:55:56] being writhing on the ground broken back
[1:55:58] can't even walk but he shouts from there
[1:56:00] ain't
[1:56:03] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:56:05] and to him and he's been doing that for
[1:56:08] thousands of years and he knows how
[1:56:09] humans work very well and he's been
[1:56:11] engineering societies but even though in
[1:56:16] the book of Revelation and revelation 9
[1:56:18] it says that you know around the time of
[1:56:20] the Second World War
[1:56:21] first and second world war that were
[1:56:23] just around that time man really stepped
[1:56:26] off the tree of life in a general sense
[1:56:28] and started eating from the tree of
[1:56:30] knowledge that's why there's the
[1:56:31] technological advancement and here comes
[1:56:34] the smokers is what does it say that an
[1:56:40] angel fell from heaven a star fell from
[1:56:42] heaven I'm at the end of my sermon now
[1:56:47] so he's an a fifth angel sounded
[1:56:49] revelation 9:1 and two and I saw a star
[1:56:53] fall from heaven unto the earth and to
[1:56:55] him was given the key of the bottomless
[1:56:57] pit and I believe that key was the
[1:57:01] technological advancement to enable this
[1:57:06] so that the world could be controlled by
[1:57:09] media but anyway and he opened the
[1:57:17] bottomless pit and there arose a smoke
[1:57:19] out of the pit and this as the smoke of
[1:57:22] a great furnace and the Sun and the air
[1:57:24] was darkened by reason of the smoke of
[1:57:26] the pit now when we read the book of
[1:57:29] Revelation it's symbolic now the Sun is
[1:57:31] actually the Word of God the truth and
[1:57:33] the air is the Holy Ghost is the
[1:57:35] atmosphere it's the heavenly dimension
[1:57:38] that's our spiritual habitat where where
[1:57:42] men salute and that habitat has
[1:57:44] ministered to you by anointed preacher
[1:57:46] and you catch that in your identify love
[1:57:49] that psychologically and it comes down
[1:57:51] into here becomes a revelation to you
[1:57:53] and God renders a three-dimensional a
[1:57:55] seven dimensional image in your life you
[1:57:58] know it's seven dimensions it's not just
[1:58:00] for three maybe it's seven and that
[1:58:04] seven dimensional image in your life is
[1:58:06] given to you by revelation of the Father
[1:58:08] and it reveals but you have to hear it
[1:58:11] and then
[1:58:16] so that smoke rose up and it just clouds
[1:58:19] everybody and clouds everything in cloud
[1:58:21] society clear blocks out the Sun and you
[1:58:24] see after the first and second world
[1:58:26] wars look what how society is degraded
[1:58:28] so insanely degraded absolutely
[1:58:33] demolished morale morally morally
[1:58:36] demolished you know these things that
[1:58:38] are better and these things that are far
[1:58:40] worse the things that are better a pale
[1:58:42] in comparison to the things that it was
[1:58:44] that were good morally so there is a
[1:58:48] degradation that's happened in society
[1:58:49] and as a result of this the smoke came
[1:58:54] out of the pit
[1:58:56] thank God hallelujah now we're going
[1:58:59] back to the appearing again because when
[1:59:02] that happened and all of this world and
[1:59:05] any church that became part of the world
[1:59:07] system any church that's governed by a
[1:59:09] hierarchy of men there's part of the
[1:59:11] world system because the the general
[1:59:14] consensus is to follow the times to
[1:59:16] follow the fashions to be led by the
[1:59:20] image of the Beast to be led by the
[1:59:24] image of the beast to be which is the
[1:59:25] Gentile world power which is Rome which
[1:59:28] is America which is the conglomerate of
[1:59:30] leadership in the earth that is
[1:59:32] basically the Beast
[1:59:35] and so what you have there is any world
[1:59:38] system that is led by their it comes
[1:59:41] under that and it's completely
[1:59:42] influenced by that and it's under that
[1:59:44] smoke now about god richard mercy
[1:59:46] hallelujah he appeared to his elect he
[1:59:52] appears to his he appears to his church
[1:59:55] and to anybody he says behold I stand at
[1:59:58] the door and knock was he knocking on
[2:00:00] he's knocking on the door of the church
[2:00:01] he's knocking on the door of Babylon
[2:00:03] he's knocking on the door of your prime
[2:00:05] he's knocking on the door of your
[2:00:08] culture he's knocking on the door of all
[2:00:12] of who you think you are personal
[2:00:18] the appearing of Jesus Christ knocking
[2:00:21] hallelujah and he's saying if any man
[2:00:23] will hear my voice and open and I was
[2:00:30] what is he gonna give you no Bible up
[2:00:33] here is there hallelujah six thousand
[2:00:39] years that was sealed with seven seals
[2:00:41] and then he said that the entire
[2:00:44] according to Daniel and according to
[2:00:46] many other prophecies he says at the end
[2:00:48] time I will appear and I'll give it to
[2:00:52] you the full image of Christ your
[2:00:55] inheritance if you eat this you'll live
[2:00:57] forever
[2:00:57] Ignis you'll be raptured and the whole
[2:01:02] world was full of smoke and all the
[2:01:04] societies and all of any world system
[2:01:06] anything was controlled by man would
[2:01:07] come under there fish come under
[2:01:09] Hollywood's all of those influences and
[2:01:16] powers and slavery let's smoke
[2:01:20] everywhere all that people can see now
[2:01:22] you think about that when you're
[2:01:24] immersed in something fully immersed
[2:01:26] full immersion if you look that way it's
[2:01:28] there you look that way that way is
[2:01:30] spherically surrounding you the world is
[2:01:33] spherically surrounded by smoke
[2:01:38] spiritual smoke that blocks out their
[2:01:40] vision of the Sun and the completely
[2:01:45] blocked
[2:01:46] but here comes I'll read it revelation
[2:01:51] 10:1 and I saw another mighty angel come
[2:01:53] down from heaven hallelujah a man had
[2:01:57] clothed with a rate cloud and I'll do
[2:01:59] here who knows I'm gonna talk about the
[2:02:01] cloud in a minute I'll talk about the
[2:02:05] cloud because he's close with a cloud
[2:02:09] hallelujah amen this is our God
[2:02:12] this is front-page news and a rainbow
[2:02:17] was upon his head
[2:02:18] hallelujah the whole rainbow and his
[2:02:22] face was as it were the Sun now we read
[2:02:25] before about how the moon would shine
[2:02:26] like the brightness of the Sun areas
[2:02:28] this is his face here is front-page news
[2:02:31] and his feet as pillars of fire
[2:02:34] hallelujah so we've seen a pillar of
[2:02:36] fire we've seen a cloud hallelujah amen
[2:02:40] and I'll read these things in a minute
[2:02:43] because otherwise it just sounds strange
[2:02:45] but we have seen these things and this
[2:02:47] is reality this is front-page news this
[2:02:49] is your habitat when you can identify
[2:02:51] what is happening prophetically this you
[2:02:56] can be living it do you want to know
[2:02:58] what you can live him here he is nothing
[2:03:00] on the door of stoked man he's knocking
[2:03:03] on the door of the rest Church he's

[2:03:06] ever these nothing on the other son

[2:03:34] drink that wine and it's going to change
[2:03:36] the way he thinks hallelujah people
[2:03:39] drink wine in the earth and it starts to
[2:03:41] open them up and they start to talk the
[2:03:42] truth amen they start to say what they
[2:03:45] really think
[2:03:45] hey they're different they get all happy
[2:03:49] and they get lightheaded and depends on
[2:03:51] how much they take them like in a bit

[2:05:04] drinking until you are inebriated
[2:05:06] hallelujah and you will get if you open
[2:05:09] the aperture just open it right up
[2:05:11] hallelujah
[2:05:12] and just put them on open now don't
[2:05:14] actually because you need to discern
[2:05:15] other stuff but when you're in church
[2:05:17] when you are in some way where you can
[2:05:18] trust and you you know the words coming
[2:05:20] or your in your prayer time or your in a
[2:05:22] Bible study open the aperture let it
[2:05:25] open and enjoy it because that's that
[2:05:28] joy the joy of the Lord is my strength
[2:05:31] strengthened by the revelation of the
[2:05:33] word I'm going to let that word I'm
[2:05:35] going to let it just permeate me that's
[2:05:39] what eating the Bacchus let permeate
[2:05:44] every fiber of your being
[2:05:46] every essence of your spirit every part
[2:05:49] of who you were and will be as that
[2:05:52] eternal word because you were part of
[2:05:54] the I am hallelu
[2:06:03] is that
[2:06:10] Philippians 4:8 finally brethren
[2:06:13] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[2:06:14] things are honest whatsoever things are
[2:06:18] just whatsoever things are pure
[2:06:20] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[2:06:23] things are of good report if there be
[2:06:26] any virtue if there be any praise think
[2:06:29] on these
[2:06:41] we've done it
[2:06:48] 2 Corinthians 10 water 6 CC for the
[2:06:52] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[2:06:54] but mighty through God to the pulling
[2:06:59] down of strongholds this is and this is
[2:07:02] something that you have to do you have
[2:07:06] power mighty through God is not your
[2:07:07] strength now but he gave you he invested
[2:07:10] some power unto you he gave you
[2:07:12] authority in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:07:16] cast down the enemy cast down those
[2:07:19] thoughts this rhythm
[2:07:22] casting down imaginations and every high
[2:07:25] thing that exalts itself against the
[2:07:28] knowledge of God and bringing into
[2:07:30] captivity every thought man when I first
[2:07:34] read that and I'm sure many people hear
[2:07:36] that they think I'm like goodness that's
[2:07:37] too much and then I started us honestly
[2:07:41] but you say lord please help me I went
[2:07:43] up from prayer many times at the start
[2:07:44] of my walk with the Lord because I had
[2:07:46] so much bad thoughts going off because
[2:07:48] of my past very very bad and they were
[2:07:51] always plaguing me when I was trying to
[2:07:52] pray or just even just entering in and
[2:07:54] waiting on the Lord it was just like
[2:07:56] this barrage you actually have to you
[2:08:01] want to be a diligent gardener so that
[2:08:04] only good plants are growing in your
[2:08:05] life
[2:08:06] the real identification you have to
[2:08:08] actually start gardening your mind your
[2:08:12] thoughts and God will help you until it
[2:08:15] becomes like when you drive you drive at
[2:08:18] the start and you're all worried and
[2:08:19] you're shaking and you're moving
[2:08:20] everything and you're like aw it's so
[2:08:22] hard to drive because you're thinking
[2:08:24] here but after a while you just drive
[2:08:26] and you don't even think because it's
[2:08:28] been registered within your subconscious
[2:08:30] the same thing happens with your force
[2:08:32] you become subconsciously autonomous
[2:08:36] with your thought life with discerning
[2:08:39] thoughts it just becomes naturally
[2:08:41] naturally every thought becomes it'll be
[2:08:44] arrested and the one center of the Lord
[2:08:46] will be you will you'll enjoy and you
[2:08:50] will meditate on those and the ones that
[2:08:53] are of the of the devil and thoughts
[2:08:56] that are just negative it cast it out
[2:08:58] you actually
[2:09:00] the ability the authority to take that
[2:09:03] thought that entity and literally take
[2:09:07] it out of your mind and cast it away
[2:09:09] it's a spirit it's a spirit this is
[2:09:13] where the world of psychology doesn't
[2:09:15] they lose that they they stop their
[2:09:17] understanding here this is where they
[2:09:18] can't explain it they've got that goes
[2:09:20] beyond sir
[2:09:21] natural explanation where a thought
[2:09:23] comes from is right there because they
[2:09:25] don't accept spirit they don't accept
[2:09:28] demonic power or heavenly power they
[2:09:30] don't accept that so they can't explain
[2:09:32] it they don't know I know writing one
[2:09:36] thought from a psychological perspective
[2:09:39] for a while and yeah I can see you know
[2:09:44] because you read their things their
[2:09:45] essays and things some of the stuff you
[2:09:47] know it's very abstract and like it just
[2:09:50] you know that they're just clutching at
[2:09:52] stuff that there's because this is the
[2:09:54] problem with science as they they are
[2:09:56] denying the very foundation of all
[2:09:58] things but then scientists that can
[2:10:01] actually do an unbiased way take
[2:10:04] scientific discovery and take the Bible
[2:10:06] and join them together because God is
[2:10:11] the Creator God is the genesis of all
[2:10:13] things and when you can see that you'll
[2:10:16] see that it actually all makes sense and
[2:10:18] everything clicks together perfectly but
[2:10:21] then you get by us on both sides you get
[2:10:23] creationists that are anti science and
[2:10:25] they lose their balance and then you get
[2:10:28] scientists that are anti God and they
[2:10:29] lose their balance but when you get a
[2:10:30] scientist that can actually join the two
[2:10:32] together in harmony because science is
[2:10:35] just the discovery of God's creation
[2:10:37] when you see there and there's no bias
[2:10:40] it's just balanced you have a scientist
[2:10:42] that's got the ability to discover and
[2:10:44] measure and they can measure it by the
[2:10:48] foundation of what it really is
[2:10:50] and there's the same thing with your
[2:10:52] thinking you need to measure you need to
[2:10:56] become a scientist of your mind of your
[2:10:59] thoughts of whatever comes into you so
[2:11:02] and having an ax readiness now I'm
[2:11:05] casting down imaginations and every high
[2:11:07] thing that exalts itself against the
[2:11:09] knowledge of God and bringing into kept
[2:11:12] every thought to the obedience of Christ
[2:11:15] and having Anna readiness to revenge all
[2:11:19] disobedience when your obedience is
[2:11:22] fulfilled Colossians 3:1 if ye then be
[2:11:31] risen with Christ seek those things
[2:11:33] which are above where Christ sitteth on
[2:11:35] the right hand of God set your affection
[2:11:39] on things above not on things on the
[2:11:42] earth set your affection your affections
[2:11:49] what you enjoy what you like we need to
[2:11:57] get into the four-year did in your life
[2:12:01] is hid with Christ and God Psalm 16
[2:12:06] verse 8 I have set the Lord always
[2:12:09] before me because he is at my right hand
[2:12:12] I shall not be moved
[2:12:15] Psalm 101 3 sorry we're moving through
[2:12:19] this but I'm sure you can absorb these
[2:12:21] things I will set no wicked thing before
[2:12:26] mine eyes I hate the work of them that
[2:12:31] turn aside it shall not cleave to me it
[2:12:35] doesn't say I hate their workers the
[2:12:38] work the energy that they put into what
[2:12:41] they put into that's causing destruction
[2:12:43] and taking people from God and removing
[2:12:45] faith out of the human life I hate that
[2:12:48] work that is that produces death
[2:12:58] now just want to read this quote here
[2:13:00] because I thought this was actually this
[2:13:02] was in the family altar but I'm so
[2:13:03] impressed by it I want to read it and it
[2:13:05] was really the inspiration while part of
[2:13:08] the inspiration of the subject sit here
[2:13:12] missus from Jehovah of miracles in 1959
[2:13:16] that says oh it's too bad that the
[2:13:19] church today doesn't walk in the spirit
[2:13:21] like that more than we do for us that
[2:13:26] kind of a time that when God comes to
[2:13:28] you you know it was on the road to
[2:13:29] Emmaus Winkley opus and his friend was
[2:13:32] speaking and talking and thinking about
[2:13:34] Jesus and thinking about Jesus that he
[2:13:37] walked out of the bushes by the side of
[2:13:39] them and walked with them it's while we
[2:13:42] are thinking upon him the trouble of the
[2:13:45] world today we are thinking about
[2:13:47] everything else but him then we wonder
[2:13:51] why we don't get blessings do wonder
[2:13:55] that sometimes why is my life plain why
[2:13:58] don't I see those things
[2:14:00] what's it not why doesn't it happen to
[2:14:02] me what do you think
[2:14:03] where are your thoughts always you know
[2:14:07] what does the worship coming from God is
[2:14:09] there a connection pray without ceasing
[2:14:13] that doesn't mean going around reciting
[2:14:15] prayers that is an attitude of your life
[2:14:22] let that become autonomous you're always
[2:14:25] thinking about him it was just a few
[2:14:28] weeks ago about three weeks ago when I
[2:14:30] sit down by some sycamore trees and I as
[2:14:33] I was telling you and begin to think it
[2:14:36] was there for the first time that he
[2:14:37] came into cleared the new ministry to me
[2:14:39] think on him draw nigh unto me and I'll
[2:14:42] draw nigh unto you saith the Lord think
[2:14:45] upon him David spake that he was right
[2:14:50] his Commandments on the bedpost and
[2:14:52] meditate on them day and night that's
[2:14:54] what the church ought to do would keep
[2:14:57] your heart tuned in with God day and
[2:15:00] night for it's then when he appears now
[2:15:06] Louie Solomon said as a man thinketh in
[2:15:09] his heart so does he begin to think that
[2:15:12] you're one of us child children that he
[2:15:14] saved you that is good to you and that
[2:15:16] you love him and he loves you don't just
[2:15:19] wait till you go to church or some
[2:15:20] convenient hour just keep him on your
[2:15:23] mind all the time all the time every day
[2:15:28] keep him on your mind and I believe that
[2:15:32] this is a the Lord is saying these
[2:15:35] things this is carrot now he wants us to
[2:15:38] think on him he wants our mind to
[2:15:41] worship Him we we again we get caught up
[2:15:45] in busyness we get caught up in all
[2:15:46] these things but let's think on him more
[2:15:51] and as she went and as she went I'm
[2:15:56] walking down the street it was one no
[2:16:00] one yet on the street and as she walked
[2:16:02] along the dirt path recital all of a
[2:16:04] sudden she began to realize there was
[2:16:05] something around her she's talking about
[2:16:10] me Reena sorry I must have deleted
[2:16:14] yeah this is actually talking about Mary
[2:16:16] now as a real strange feeling oh that's
[2:16:21] the most wonderful experience
[2:16:23] I trust that everybody here has
[2:16:26] experienced them kind of at times if you
[2:16:28] haven't this would be a good night to
[2:16:30] start and I say this will be a good day
[2:16:32] it's not just start thinking on him it's
[2:16:36] not worshiping him let the expression of
[2:16:38] your life give thanks to don't be
[2:16:43] condemned in your own babies you know
[2:16:45] that kind of self condemnation can pull
[2:16:47] you right out of worship that makes you
[2:16:49] feel like you're not worthy to worship
[2:16:51] that's blood made you worthy to worship
[2:16:53] it's not about how worthy you are or
[2:16:56] your behavior that's already painful
[2:16:59] amen you can just enjoy even if you feel
[2:17:02] like we haven't prayed enough just pray
[2:17:04] a little bit just enjoy you have worship
[2:17:09] hallelujah oh that most wonderful
[2:17:14] experience I trust that everybody here
[2:17:15] has experienced them kind of at times if
[2:17:17] you haven't this would be a good night
[2:17:19] to start just start thinking about him
[2:17:21] and worship him in your heart and all of
[2:17:23] a sudden you'll feel the close
[2:17:25] fellowship of the holy spirit around you
[2:17:27] all around you and it gets so anointed
[2:17:30] until you can't hold it any longer
[2:17:31] you'll raise up your hands and you'll do
[2:17:34] something you just can't stand still
[2:17:36] when it comes a man hallelujah
[2:17:39] and as she was thinking not noticing who
[2:17:42] was around here the little lady perhaps
[2:17:43] a pair of sandals on her feet walking
[2:17:45] along this little dusty path but
[2:17:47] thinking of the Lord and of his promises
[2:17:49] and all things to come amen and as she
[2:17:52] was thinking all of a sudden that
[2:17:54] feeling got so great around her until
[2:17:56] she just raised up her head and when she
[2:17:58] did standing before who was alive and
[2:18:00] standing by that light was Gabriel the
[2:18:03] angel the angel of God if you want
[2:18:06] angels to appear to keep your mind on
[2:18:09] God and all the things
[2:18:12] if you you you know not not just the

[2:19:02] and he together rise up above
[2:19:10] self-condemnation

[2:19:15] yourself what you've judged yourself to
[2:19:18] be under your own experience that
[2:19:21] doesn't actually really matter in the
[2:19:23] grand scheme of things because God has
[2:19:26] seen an image of you God has seen who
[2:19:28] you really are God has seen you perfect

[2:20:43] this happened in 1963 and February 28
[2:20:46] this is the exit from the Life magazine
[2:20:49] and I'll read the scripture here it says
[2:20:53] annex to serpentina season it shall come
[2:20:56] to pass then the last days saith god I
[2:20:58] will pour out of my spirit upon all
[2:21:00] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[2:21:02] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[2:21:04] see visions and your old men shall dream
[2:21:06] dreams and on my servant and my man hand
[2:21:09] mates I will pour out of my spirit in
[2:21:12] those days and they shall prophesy and I
[2:21:15] will show wonders in the heavens above
[2:21:18] and science and the earth beneath blood
[2:21:21] in fire and vapor of smoke this cloud
[2:21:25] formed when brother Branham was
[2:21:28] commissioned to write to go and preach
[2:21:30] the opening of the seven seals and seven
[2:21:32] angels came to him and commissioned him
[2:21:35] and then we made the partnered when they
[2:21:37] run lifted back up into the sky they
[2:21:39] formed this cloud and the cloud was seen
[2:21:44] this is here the Sun shall be turned
[2:21:46] into darkness a blood before the great
[2:21:50] notable day of the Lord I hear
[2:21:55] revelation 1:7 behold he cometh with
[2:21:57] clouds and every eye shall see him
[2:22:01] now if you actually read if you see what
[2:22:06] happened on that that will be all around
[2:22:08] America they went all over the world
[2:22:11] [Music]
[2:22:12] they couldn't explain they which pierced
[2:22:19] him and all Kindred's of the earth shall
[2:22:21] wail because of them even so amen
[2:22:25] next one - is that when he had spoken
[2:22:28] these things while they beheld he was
[2:22:29] taken up
[2:22:33] you turn the cloud over to the right and
[2:22:37] actually as Christ the supreme white
[2:22:40] would ducky returning back to the earth
[2:22:42] a heaven on February 28th 1963 and this
[2:22:46] was the appearance of Christ and when
[2:22:48] those seals was preached the seven seals
[2:22:50] was open the book became open and
[2:22:54] revealed the truth fullness of Christ so
[2:22:57] that he could be preached has been 50
[2:22:59] years since then and the end the
[2:23:01] ministry has fought there and developed
[2:23:03] and preaching these things and the
[2:23:05] church has caught it and the very life
[2:23:07] it was in the word has now become flesh
[2:23:10] in you and this was just a sign in the
[2:23:13] heavens that Christ he would come back
[2:23:16] what was he coming back to bring them
[2:23:22] out of Babylon to say come out of her my
[2:23:26] people come out of her come out of
[2:23:29] denominationalism come out of your own

[2:23:38] of the culture of America and come out
[2:23:41] of the culture of Holland come out of
[2:23:43] the culture of your own ideologies come
[2:23:46] out of the culture of education
[2:23:49] that programming programming communes
[2:23:54] come out come out because the supreme
[2:23:58] judge the supreme judge and the formulas
[2:24:02] word to preach to you to minister to you
[2:24:04] an entrance into the everlasting kingdom
[2:24:07] of Jesus Christ here he is Alleluia this
[2:24:11] is one of the science and the evidence
[2:24:13] that he promised and it says here annex
[2:24:17] 1 verse 9 ER when he had spoken these
[2:24:18] things while they beheld he was taken up
[2:24:21] and a cloud received him and out of the
[2:24:24] out of this site X 110 and while they
[2:24:27] looked steadfastly towards heaven as he
[2:24:29] went up behold two men stood by them in
[2:24:32] white apparel which also said you men of
[2:24:34] Galilee why are you standing up gazing
[2:24:36] into the heaven this same Jesus which
[2:24:39] has taken up from you into heaven shall
[2:24:41] so come and light same way he went the
[2:24:48] same way the high priest himself Jesus
[2:24:51] Christ went up into the Holy of Holies
[2:24:53] and inflict his blood on the mercy seat
[2:24:56] for seven times showing seven making the
[2:25:01] atonement interceding for the people and
[2:25:04] then once those the blood was flicked on
[2:25:06] the mercy seat seven times he wouldn't
[2:25:08] come back up
[2:25:10] and the Jubilee trauma would sound
[2:25:12] freedom from all of man's ideas freedom
[2:25:15] from all of babylons thoughts freedom
[2:25:18] from Roman Catholicism freedom from all
[2:25:21] liberal Christian freedom from lives
[2:25:25] freedom from complexes freedom from
[2:25:29] anything that would hinder your world
[2:25:31] freedom from politics freedom from
[2:25:34] anything with us shaky standing
[2:25:36] Foundation and liberation and
[2:25:39] restoration of the true image of the Son
[2:25:42] of God
[2:25:43] [Music]
[2:25:45] why because the very son calling us
[2:25:51] calling you out this is front page news
[2:25:55] this is what's happening this is the
[2:25:58] events taking place they may not see my
[2:26:01] dream
[2:26:02] but the white wisdom of man is
[2:26:04] foolishness response and the wisdom of
[2:26:07] God is foolishness to man who will you
[2:26:10] be identifying where is your
[2:26:13] identification what will you be
[2:26:16] identified with what is the identity of
[2:26:19] if I say open the wallet of your life
[2:26:21] and show me your identification is that
[2:26:24] the eternal you or is that for you that
[2:26:27] is that a fake ID that has been
[2:26:29] idealized to you by some system of man
[2:26:33] some ideology or some political movement
[2:26:36] or some churchianity what I did
[2:26:40] are you Hulk Jesus Christ appearing in
[2:26:46] the last days in the form of the
[2:26:48] fullness of his word the Seventh Seal is
[2:26:50] opened and the book being revealed that
[2:26:52] he is calling you he's calling you to
[2:26:58] eat it straight from his head's not
[2:27:01] sticking hands through a property
[2:27:09] Jesus Christ come down with an open book
[2:27:13] but rainbow about I said you know this
[2:27:15] magazine so the page of this magazine
[2:27:18] you're looking at the page they're the
[2:27:21] other side of that page was a moonbeam
[2:27:24] rainbow on the same magazine now this is
[2:27:26] a scientific magazine they took the
[2:27:28] photo this is the Life magazine which is
[2:27:30] like the Time magazine
[2:27:31] it's a scientific magazine and they
[2:27:33] wondered what this was because this
[2:27:34] cloud was just too high it wasn't even a
[2:27:37] normal cloud they couldn't describe it
[2:27:39] they couldn't make sentiment now when
[2:27:42] bit on the other side of that page as a
[2:27:44] moonbeam rainbow that they took because
[2:27:47] they were amazed it was how this rainbow
[2:27:48] the moon had shone so bright and there
[2:27:51] was rain coming down and the the the
[2:27:55] light refracted through the rain of the
[2:27:58] moonlight showing the church's light and
[2:28:01] the letter rain falling of this one
[2:28:04] coming the latter rain falling and the
[2:28:07] moonlight shining through and it causing
[2:28:09] a rainbow
[2:28:10] what are you causing rainbows shine
[2:28:15] choose your identity and you hold that
[2:28:18] cloud picture up through the light let
[2:28:20] the light shine through the picture and
[2:28:22] the rainbow was right about the heat of
[2:28:24] that clip that is our God
[2:28:27] this is how God rolls this is how he
[2:28:30] vindicates things beyond any shadow of a
[2:28:34] doubt beyond any politics beyond any
[2:28:36] thoughts of man beyond any haters or
[2:28:38] backbiters or Pharisees that don't
[2:28:40] believe God for decades
[2:28:43] message because he is calling not real

[2:29:08] there was a woman in a tent
[2:29:10] her name was junior and she was stuck
[2:29:13] her husband had made a covenant with the
[2:29:14] Canaanites and they were stuck under
