[6:27] that what was wrote was enough
[6:30] he was standing out there and he had his
[6:33] bonds all fixed up and everything was
[6:36] just going fine and he was standing
[6:38] there looking then thought well now

[6:43] come maybe maybe they won't come this
[6:45] year

[6:51] and while I was standing there he heard
[6:53] a noise he raised up on open the window
[6:56] and look coming in on down the roads he
[7:00] had guns 600 armed Philistines there

[8:49] he begin you begin to get this feel it
[8:53] coming up on him he said yeah I'm a Jew

[9:11] couldn't learn to to fight with a sword
[9:14] he was a farmer he didn't even have a
[9:17] fight in him
[9:18] but he know that the promise of God was
[9:21] with him and he was circumcised and he
[9:24] stuck to that promise and if every man

[46:24] Lord today we're going to read mark one
[46:34] down to verse 20 mark 5 so verses 1 to
[46:39] 20
[46:51] so I don't have a slideshow what's that
[46:54] yep was here we are and they came over
[46:56] unto the other side of the sea into the
[46:59] country of the gadarenes and when he was
[47:02] come out of the ship immediately there
[47:04] met him out of the tombs of man with an
[47:06] unclean spirit who had his dwelling
[47:09] among the tombs and no man could bind
[47:11] him no not with chains because he that
[47:13] had been off bound with fetters and
[47:15] change the chains had been plucked
[47:16] asunder by him and the fetters broken in
[47:19] pieces neither could any man tame him
[47:21] and always night and day he was in the
[47:24] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[47:26] cutting himself with stones for when he
[47:28] saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped
[47:31] him and cried with a loud voice but I
[47:34] want you to notice who's doing the
[47:35] worshipping as it the manner is at
[47:38] Legion I want you to see just just look
[47:40] at us here and when he saw Jesus afar
[47:43] off he ran and worshipped them and cried
[47:45] with a loud voice saying what have I to
[47:47] do with thee Jesus our son of the Most
[47:49] High God I adjure thee by God that thou
[47:52] art torment me not this is the devil
[47:54] worshiping for he said unto him come out
[47:57] of the man thou unclean spirit and he
[47:59] asked him what is thy name and he said
[48:02] saying my name is legion for we are many
[48:03] and he besought him much that he would
[48:06] not send him away out of the country now
[48:09] there was their high unto the mountains
[48:11] a great herd of swine feeding and all
[48:13] the devil's besought him saying send us
[48:15] into the swine that we may enter into
[48:17] them for as much Jesus gave them leave
[48:20] and the unclean spirits
[48:22] excuse-me went out and entered into the
[48:24] swine and the herd round
[48:26] ran violently down a steep place into
[48:28] the sea there about two thousand and
[48:31] were choked in the sea and they did't
[48:32] feed the swine fled and told it in the
[48:35] city and in the country and they went
[48:36] out to see what it was that was done and
[48:39] they come to Jesus and see him that was
[48:42] possessed with the devil and had and had
[48:44] the legions sitting clothed and in his
[48:46] right mind and they were afraid and they
[48:50] that saw it told them how it befell to
[48:53] him that was possessed with the devil
[48:54] and also concerning the swine so they
[48:56] began to testify of what happened to
[48:58] this man and the result was and they
[49:00] began to pray him to depart out of their
[49:01] coasts and
[49:03] he was coming to the ship he that was
[49:05] possessed with the devil prayed him that
[49:07] he would might might be with him howbeit
[49:10] Jesus suffered him not and south--and
[49:12] him go home to thy friends and tell them
[49:15] how great things the Lord has done for
[49:16] thee and hath compassion on thee and he
[49:18] departed and began to publish and jakka
[49:22] bless or have you say that I don't know
[49:24] how great things Jesus had done for him
[49:26] and all men did marvel I mean this bow
[49:29] heads and a word of Prayer gracious Lord
[49:31] we are so thankful we can be standing in
[49:34] your presence once more Lord to know
[49:36] that by your precious blood we have no
[49:38] condemnation we have no sin Lord you've
[49:40] you've answered that question you've
[49:42] taken all guilt and shame away Lord
[49:45] that's your doing and we rejoice because
[49:46] it's you're doing Lord we're so thankful
[49:48] that no one can boast in your presence
[49:50] no mortal can't declare any goodness of
[49:52] their own selves Lord because we know
[49:54] it's all you Lord salvation is of you
[49:56] who lured our Walkers of you our rapture
[49:58] will be of you as well and dear God I
[50:00] just pray that you'll bless your word to
[50:02] your people now father
[50:03] noid speaker and here one more time Lord
[50:05] what good is it if the people are
[50:07] anointed but I am NOT or if I am
[50:09] anointed and the people are not Lord we
[50:10] must both be anointed so may we be one
[50:13] heart one mind one Accord Lord may what
[50:15] we face tomorrow just be put one Lord to
[50:17] one side you already know what's going
[50:19] to happen tomorrow you're not worried
[50:20] about it Lord so therefore we shall not
[50:22] be worried neither Lord because our
[50:24] lives are in your hands so I asked
[50:26] father may your blessing be upon us now
[50:28] and anoint your word to our hearts Lord
[50:29] may you grant the police Lord in Jesus
[50:31] Christ name Amen
[50:33] I mean God bless you all you may have
[50:35] your seats so it's quite a quite a scene
[50:42] we've read here with speaking of Legion
[50:44] I just wanted to point that out with
[50:46] with with who was worshiping there and
[50:50] we're gonna come back to that but
[50:51] brother brownie says and the message
[50:53] identification he says now may the Lord
[50:56] had his blessings to the reading of his
[50:57] word I'd like to take for a few minutes
[50:59] of your time
[51:00] on what I would call or like to say a
[51:03] text called identification identifying
[51:06] identified in the likeness of Bible
[51:09] characters being identified in the
[51:11] likeness of Bible characters and tonight
[51:13] as I thought an approach to this after
[51:16] we have this
[51:17] begin talking of us coming and how that
[51:19] the church should make itself ready
[51:22] he says I'm sure tonight we ought to
[51:24] find ourselves somewhere in some
[51:26] character of the Bible so that we would
[51:29] know the outcome of that character and
[51:31] know what our outcome will be amen so we
[51:35] want to be identified in the scripture
[51:37] and every man woman and child will be
[51:39] identified in the scripture but it's
[51:42] really what you give yourself to as what
[51:44] you'll be identified and now brother
[51:46] cadre said this at camp and it really
[51:48] blessed me how he said when Abel offered
[51:50] the lamb God could identify himself and
[51:53] that sacrifice because he was a lamb so
[51:55] now if you go all the way through the
[51:57] scripture you can see where God
[51:59] identifies himself with the people now
[52:01] when I when I speak of him being
[52:04] identified it's because he can see
[52:06] himself in that life hallelujah he could
[52:09] not see himself in Cain sacrifice
[52:11] because that was not what God was God
[52:13] was not fruit he was a lamb hallelujah
[52:15] so so now you know so when God can see
[52:19] himself in our lives then he will anoint
[52:21] our lives accordingly
[52:22] so you see Moses Moses went down to
[52:25] Egypt as a deliverer and God could
[52:27] identify himself in Moses ministry
[52:29] because he was the deliverer so he had
[52:31] anointed Moses life accordingly to
[52:33] manifest that deliverer and see you can
[52:35] go all the way down through the
[52:36] scripture and you see when man begins or
[52:39] man a woman began to begin to move
[52:41] according to the promise of God God says
[52:43] I can identify myself in that life and
[52:45] he anoints that life the supernatural
[52:47] takes place and God vindicates his word
[52:49] to that person you take like the
[52:51] shunammite woman God gave them the baby
[52:53] supernaturally she couldn't have a child
[52:55] you know and and and and the prophets
[52:57] heed to a servant you know she's been
[52:58] good to us look they've built this
[53:00] little room for us here as we journey
[53:02] through and you know what do you think
[53:04] we could do you know to - you're you're
[53:06] in Thanksgiving back you know do you
[53:08] think we talked to the king or whatever
[53:10] more but you know the servants here but
[53:12] they have no children and so now then
[53:14] then the inspiration moved on the
[53:16] prophecies go tell that woman thus saith
[53:18] the Lord you're going to have a child
[53:19] and she had a son but then it was out
[53:23] with us dead in the field and it got
[53:24] heatstroke you know and you know got
[53:26] sick and it died but that woman now now
[53:28] God
[53:29] gonna see what the woman was gonna do
[53:31] because God wanted to identify himself
[53:33] in her life again hallelujah so it
[53:36] wasn't just a one time where we're
[53:38] because she was good to the Prophet that
[53:39] she got a blessing now God was going to
[53:42] put her under a test to identify herself
[53:44] in his Amit did identify himself in her
[53:48] life I mean said oh here she was she had
[53:50] been given a child by promise but now
[53:52] death had struck the child what was she
[53:54] gonna do she was either gonna bury the
[53:56] child she had a choice you could either
[53:58] bury the child say well that was
[53:59] wonderful but now the blessings God or
[54:01] she could go back to that man of God
[54:03] because she knew that the Prophet God
[54:05] was in that prophet and she knew if I
[54:06] could just get him to that just get my
[54:09] boy to him I mean he can raise him from
[54:11] the dead because the one who raised did
[54:13] in the past was the same God that was in
[54:15] the Prophet I mean so she said to her
[54:17] servant said Allah mule what's going to
[54:19] go get him hallelujah and then the
[54:21] Prophet you know beginning yoga has he
[54:23] or whatever it was the servant looked
[54:24] and saw the Shoom light coming and you
[54:26] know and then the Shunammite said you
[54:28] know it's all well with thee was asked
[54:29] she said all as well she's got a dead
[54:32] son on a bed at home but she's saying
[54:34] all as well why because she's about to
[54:37] be identified with a resurrection
[54:38] because God was going to look at her
[54:40] life and say I can identify myself in
[54:42] this woman's faith now you're going to
[54:44] understand from the get-go God gives us
[54:46] that faith it's not aeronite oh that's a
[54:49] nice idea I'll try that all this is a
[54:51] good idea or someone else has tried it
[54:52] no it's not that it's when God moves on
[54:55] your heart gives you the revelation that
[54:57] the word will come to pass then you act
[54:58] upon that then God says I can identify
[55:00] myself in that life
[55:01] olia so you know the rest of story she
[55:04] she comes his all as well but when she
[55:05] gets within striking do you're reaching
[55:07] business grabs the grabs his robe and
[55:09] you're helping back hallelujah God can
[55:12] identify himself on that and that
[55:14] woman's desire to see her son raised
[55:16] from the dead hallelujah so know that
[55:18] and then you know there is a story the
[55:20] Prophet goes the house lays himself on
[55:21] the child you know who is dead life
[55:23] comes back and the child is restored
[55:27] God moved in a supernatural way because
[55:29] he can identify himself in that woman's
[55:31] faith a man you can take you know when
[55:33] brother Brown when you know he's flying
[55:35] through Memphis and his plane is
[55:36] grounded I mean because you don't see
[55:38] this woman could identify herself in the
[55:41] scripture
[55:41] she
[55:42] saw her son go off into the world she
[55:44] saw her son become sick don't know what
[55:46] it was some social disease she saw him
[55:49] getting sicker and sicker till
[55:50] eventually he he was lying there
[55:52] basically you know hanging you know
[55:54] between life and death just cried mum
[55:56] it's dark oh it's dark mama you know and
[56:00] and but she was praying and she began to
[56:03] pray Lord Lord I'm not the shunammite
[56:05] woman she can identify herself in the
[56:07] scripture now this is not however many
[56:09] thousand years ago this is this is an
[56:11] hour generation she can identify herself
[56:13] a description Lord you gave me the son
[56:15] now you've got to restore the son and
[56:17] she wasn't necessarily worried about his
[56:19] physical health she just wanted to know
[56:21] that he'd be saved before he went up
[56:24] into the eternity and so she began to
[56:26] pray thank God I'm like I'm like the
[56:28] Shunammite woman where's my Elijah
[56:30] where's my prophet hallelujah and God
[56:33] had the prophet oh you're in the place
[56:35] the plane was grounded not because of
[56:37] the prophets faith it was that woman's
[56:39] faith caused the storm I mean which
[56:41] caused the plane to be grounded
[56:42] hallelujah that same faith is in your
[56:45] life if God reveals to you who you are
[56:48] in the scripture then how they overcome
[56:50] their outcome will be your outcome and
[56:52] her outcome was God gave a revision when
[56:55] she was praying she'll brother Bram
[56:56] walking down the street so before dawn
[56:58] she was their honor sitting there you
[57:00] know leaning on her gate waiting he's
[57:03] coming where is he and she was laying
[57:06] there and there brother but and then now
[57:08] God begins to act on both ends the
[57:10] planes grounded brother I said why let's
[57:11] go for a walk or whatever he decided to
[57:13] do and then the Lord yo he's just
[57:15] looking some some shop Lord says start
[57:17] walking just start walking it's quite a
[57:19] distance from where that was to where
[57:21] she lived it's quite a bit he just
[57:23] walked kept walking down into that color
[57:25] district he says and then finally he's
[57:27] walking past she's leaning on the fence
[57:29] cuz why the one that God showed was
[57:32] coming was walking down was more than a
[57:34] vision now the visuals becoming material
[57:36] hollow it's the same thing with you and
[57:38] I when you see this when you see
[57:39] yourself identified in the word I mean
[57:41] you know it's not just me to stay as a
[57:43] vision it must become flesh so here she
[57:46] comes your he comes down and she just
[57:48] says good morning parson he says good
[57:51] morning aunty as they would address each
[57:52] other and well how did you know as a
[57:54] parson they begin to talk
[57:56] then she said you know but where's your
[57:57] where's your suitcase he left it in the
[58:00] hotel see then then then you know she's
[58:04] invited Simon tells the story he says
[58:07] I've been in King's palaces but there
[58:08] was nothing like this
[58:09] god bless our home on the your front
[58:12] door it's a little shotgun house but he
[58:14] said this is far greater than a palace
[58:15] and he says now you pray and then he
[58:20] said you could tell she knew who he was
[58:22] who she was talking to well I'm just
[58:25] talking to the air something no she knew
[58:27] him that's the main thing got to know
[58:29] him hallelujah and then and then brother
[58:32] BAM prayed and then he just forget to go
[58:34] it's getting like mama it was not his
[58:37] prayer it was her prayer that brought
[58:40] her son that was going to be lost died
[58:43] lost to be come back to life again her
[58:46] faith you know we got to understand
[58:48] we're living in an age of an anointed
[58:50] people it's not just an anointed profit
[58:53] or anointed ministry it's now an
[58:54] anointed people I mean just like we read
[58:57] about I mean I mean brother ed was
[58:58] saying about killing the Philistines and
[59:00] you know I was reading in the scripture
[59:02] you know David came to a point where he
[59:04] couldn't kill Giants no more he got too
[59:06] old but then others rose up to take his
[59:09] place so the next generation rose up to
[59:12] finish off the Giants that David was
[59:13] meant to kill he picked up five stones
[59:15] when he crossed the brook to face
[59:16] Goliath why'd he pick up five because
[59:18] because Goliath had sons and brothers
[59:20] there are other Giants in the land they
[59:22] had been destroyed hallelujah but David
[59:25] didn't do the job the younger generation
[59:26] did it so when from anointing on one man
[59:28] committee police and now we're living in
[59:31] age of an anointed people not jointed
[59:33] ministry anointed profit now anointed
[59:35] people police is the same anointing on
[59:37] the prophets on you are they the same
[59:38] anointing on Jesus Christ is on you are
[59:41] the same life those are Nimbus and you
[59:42] Holly and you're going to recognize who
[59:44] you I recognize what's in you I mean
[59:46] take honor is worth whatever you do
[59:48] don't shrink back and say someone else
[59:50] or do it no you do it
[59:51] hallelujah that's when you come to a
[59:53] place where you recognize no one else is
[59:55] going to stand I'm going to say I'm
[59:57] going to take God at His Word I'm gonna
[1:00:00] play those Philistines
[1:00:01] hallelujah Sangha recognized that he was
[1:00:05] a circumcised Jew God could identify
[1:00:07] himself in his life that's why when he
[1:00:10] ran jumped out the windows we heard this
[1:00:12] morning with an ox code Georgia I can
[1:00:14] identify myself in your life Holly and
[1:00:17] supernaturally he killed every one of
[1:00:19] them why cos God said I can identify
[1:00:21] myself in that kind of a life I mean he
[1:00:24] wasn't rich he didn't have servants he
[1:00:26] had nothing but he knew he as a
[1:00:28] circumcised Jew standing is in his
[1:00:30] inheritance that was enough brother Ram
[1:00:34] said it's the same thing with you know
[1:00:35] all the Devils on my back I've got these
[1:00:36] problems that's going on you will
[1:00:38] recognize your son and daughter of God
[1:00:40] standing in the land standing in your
[1:00:42] inheritance hallelujah and you're gonna
[1:00:44] recognize that is enough hallelujah
[1:00:47] doesn't matter what the devil fights you
[1:00:49] what you're gonna recognize who you are
[1:00:50] and don't ever just think oh really no
[1:00:53] really hallelujah amen you we go down
[1:00:59] all through all the way down through the
[1:01:00] scripture God identifies themselves
[1:01:03] supernaturally because he can see
[1:01:05] himself in the life so you can say now
[1:01:08] so everything we do everything all in
[1:01:12] everything in word or deed doing the
[1:01:14] name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:15] right way because God wants to identify
[1:01:18] himself in your life in everyday life
[1:01:20] not just in church this is actually the
[1:01:23] least amen Wednesday night whenever
[1:01:26] whenever truth is that though everyday
[1:01:28] life as when the word puts on flesh I
[1:01:30] mean so everything we do everything we
[1:01:34] wear we say how we treat one another how
[1:01:36] we treat our family how we treat our
[1:01:38] children God should be able to look down
[1:01:40] and say I can identify myself in that
[1:01:44] life hallelujah I can identify how we
[1:01:48] speak to other may your speech be
[1:01:50] seasoned with grace with sure yes sir
[1:01:52] how you speak to other God sure so I can
[1:01:54] identify myself and what they're saying
[1:01:55] and anoint that word to that person
[1:01:57] probably how we treat one another
[1:01:58] preferring one another in love God's you
[1:02:01] better look down and say I can identify
[1:02:02] myself because I see myself living in
[1:02:05] those people
[1:02:06] hallelujah it's how it should be
[1:02:09] help us Lord right man that's why I say
[1:02:15] Lord that yeah that's why we're gonna
[1:02:17] die daily - if you can't live at the
[1:02:19] same time I will be you or the Lord who
[1:02:22] do you want to live I know if I'm living
[1:02:24] it's a train wreck
[1:02:25] you must just drive off the cliff it's
[1:02:28] not always gonna end badly but I don't
[1:02:30] mean that as a joke but you know
[1:02:31] humanities fails people are we gonna
[1:02:34] sort this out no we're not going to sort
[1:02:36] out nothing God's got to sort it out
[1:02:38] amen hallelujah no but so with Legion
[1:02:46] Legion God could not identify himself in
[1:02:49] legions worship because it wasn't the
[1:02:52] man worshiping it was the devil it's
[1:02:54] amazing when you look into the story of
[1:02:57] Legion it's only in Mark's Gospel where
[1:03:01] it actually identifies that Legion
[1:03:03] worship God Legion worship Jesus and we
[1:03:06] know Mark's Gospel that's under that ox
[1:03:08] anointing it just goes into the works of
[1:03:10] John the Baptist and Christ all works
[1:03:11] works works that's how it sir that's how
[1:03:13] the gospel is written so so it says the
[1:03:17] only account and the Gospels of the
[1:03:19] deliverance of Legion where it says that
[1:03:20] the Legion of Devil's and the man caused
[1:03:22] him to worship God we have to be very
[1:03:26] careful we see people worship God but
[1:03:29] what's worshiping as it as it is it the
[1:03:34] Holy Ghost in them as in a sincere heart
[1:03:36] or is actually a devil
[1:03:38] pretending to worship because if we're
[1:03:40] not careful we're not careful it can
[1:03:43] actually be an unclean spirit and
[1:03:44] someone worshiping God and it's not ours
[1:03:48] at this I trust the Lord just makes us
[1:03:50] come down the middle road because the
[1:03:52] life at the end that'll produce what the
[1:03:54] worshipers it's the life at the end it
[1:03:57] was very obvious with Legion he was
[1:03:59] cutting himself in the tombs naked crazy
[1:04:01] demon-possessed
[1:04:02] here it comes to fall down and worship
[1:04:04] God so it's very obvious there's
[1:04:06] something wrong with this man because of
[1:04:07] the life he's living right but then you
[1:04:10] bring it into our circles and people can
[1:04:13] dress right people can can act right
[1:04:16] they can quote right they can quote the
[1:04:18] scripture you're the devil can out quote
[1:04:21] every language under heaven he can quote
[1:04:23] the message to you and the scripture and
[1:04:25] it can be 100% exactly right but he
[1:04:28] can't live the life he can never produce
[1:04:30] life in the word he cannot do that but
[1:04:32] the believer by the blood of Jesus
[1:04:34] Christ can amen and that's when God can
[1:04:37] identify himself in life I mean it's
[1:04:40] when his life is and you say well I fail
[1:04:42] many times we're prone to failure we're
[1:04:45] human right the only day the moment we
[1:04:48] will stop failing is the moment these
[1:04:50] bodies change
[1:04:51] lelou yeah right that's why we need a
[1:04:54] blood that's why we need a high priest
[1:04:55] that's why we need a mediator amen for
[1:04:58] every moment up till then we need one
[1:05:00] because we're prone to failure because
[1:05:03] we're human but in the same token that
[1:05:07] that's very different someone who's you
[1:05:10] know to Legion in that state because the
[1:05:14] life after the worship what is it
[1:05:17] amen you're with me now so Legion here
[1:05:24] is Legion I just want to show you how
[1:05:27] demon power works Legion became isolated
[1:05:30] he lived in the tombs and in the
[1:05:32] mountains he was so he surrounded
[1:05:35] himself with death isolation crying to
[1:05:39] himself and cutting himself
[1:05:41] this is demon spirits where someone
[1:05:45] becomes isolated now to be isolated
[1:05:48] doesn't mean you go live up in the
[1:05:49] mountain somewhere be hermit you can be
[1:05:51] isolated even in this service right now
[1:05:53] you can be isolated in your family you
[1:05:57] can be you know you could be living in a
[1:05:59] boarding school nones abundance you'll
[1:06:01] hear but I've been there but you can be
[1:06:02] isolated living with 70 odd boys in a
[1:06:04] boarding school
[1:06:06] Amen you can be in a very big family and
[1:06:08] be isolated why cuz that's what demon
[1:06:11] powers do they try and isolate I mean
[1:06:14] because when the body comes together
[1:06:16] there's a part of God part of God comes
[1:06:18] in the bonfire God comes down
[1:06:20] deliverance can happen that's why it
[1:06:22] tries to isolate us out how does the I
[1:06:24] slightest in here and our thoughts no
[1:06:28] one cares about me no and understands me
[1:06:30] these people don't accept me you know
[1:06:32] what happens Pearson becomes
[1:06:34] isolated Amen people surround themselves
[1:06:37] by death now and back in my day we had
[1:06:40] the goth culture and the and the emo
[1:06:43] culture people dress in black lots of
[1:06:47] death and skulls and it's just evolved
[1:06:48] to something else what's happening
[1:06:51] people are anointed with death they
[1:06:53] isolate themselves we had a lot of
[1:06:55] especially the rock bands in my dates
[1:06:56] all this teenage angst you know no one
[1:06:59] understands you know that's how it was
[1:07:03] because what's happening is the devil
[1:07:06] because what happens is when people go
[1:07:08] through any change in life especially
[1:07:09] when teenagers become adults is such a
[1:07:11] massive change so now you're actually
[1:07:13] working out who am i because you
[1:07:16] actually go you making a transition from
[1:07:18] from from being as part of the family
[1:07:20] transitioning to becoming an individual
[1:07:22] and eventually you make a transition
[1:07:24] from being part of a family to making
[1:07:26] your own family but it's at in-between
[1:07:29] time it's always the transition time
[1:07:31] which is the difficult time and then so
[1:07:33] now you're so now you're getting
[1:07:34] frustrated because you wanted to grow up
[1:07:36] and become an adult and you are but then
[1:07:40] your parents are a certain way because
[1:07:42] they have to protect you you look at the
[1:07:45] you look at nature do like any herd
[1:07:48] animal do they let the little little
[1:07:50] newborns just run off they'll just go
[1:07:53] right off into the savanna enjoy the
[1:07:55] great you know kruger just go they don't
[1:07:58] the big ones are protecting the little
[1:08:01] ones because the little ones have
[1:08:04] probably never experienced a lion before
[1:08:06] they've never ever experienced the hyena
[1:08:09] pack or cheetahs or a leopard well
[1:08:11] they've never experienced it and it and
[1:08:13] their mummy and daddy could say you know
[1:08:15] now son there's something called a lion
[1:08:19] what made this big mark on the ground
[1:08:21] that's a lion poor whatever you know
[1:08:26] you know and and but then even though
[1:08:29] the chart the little one could see that
[1:08:31] they don't know what a line can do and
[1:08:33] the description of the line by the
[1:08:36] parents never matches the actual lion
[1:08:38] right and sometimes what could happen
[1:08:42] it's a little one now I was there too my
[1:08:44] parents moved overseas I was in boarding
[1:08:47] school they moved overseas what did I
[1:08:49] begin to think my parents don't
[1:08:50] understand me they don't care that was
[1:08:52] me as a teenager we've all been there
[1:08:55] before and I really thought that did
[1:08:58] they did they not care about me no they
[1:09:00] loved me they cared about me but that
[1:09:02] was what I got in my mind then what
[1:09:04] happens then you don't you can't talk to
[1:09:07] them well who are you gonna talk to talk
[1:09:09] to your peers and I just want to maybe
[1:09:12] just drop a bomb your peers don't have
[1:09:14] the best advice Solomon's son when he
[1:09:19] was gonna be made King the the elders in
[1:09:22] the country said make the taxes and the
[1:09:24] burden lighter on the people this is the
[1:09:26] ones who were Solomon the older ones but
[1:09:28] he talked to us his his peers to the
[1:09:30] same age and they said not Tek some more
[1:09:33] what happened the nation split because
[1:09:36] he listened to the wrong advice you
[1:09:40] gotta be kidding you can't experience
[1:09:42] you can't read you can't learn
[1:09:44] experience from reading in a book or
[1:09:46] watching it on YouTube or whatever you
[1:09:48] have to experience it to have experience
[1:09:50] so you've got to actually realize you
[1:09:53] know that us older ones we've been
[1:09:56] through a few things and we've been
[1:09:58] through what you're going through it's
[1:10:00] just been rebranded like spark is still
[1:10:02] telecom different logo different name
[1:10:07] does the same thing and the devilry
[1:10:09] brands he went from the Beatles to like
[1:10:11] the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and
[1:10:13] all the way down through to other we to
[1:10:16] to whatever's out now same devil just
[1:10:18] rebranded
[1:10:20] you see what's her name Lady Gaga we I I
[1:10:24] had an interview on her and she actually
[1:10:25] had posters of like different different
[1:10:28] artists that were older than her that
[1:10:30] she admired she put them up in a room
[1:10:31] and prayed make me crazy she want to
[1:10:34] draw the inspiration that that they had
[1:10:36] and become greater than them and what
[1:10:39] happened prayer answered why because
[1:10:45] just rebut the same devil rebranded amen
[1:10:50] now you can even take the same thing in
[1:10:53] the sports world you can't compare
[1:10:56] people try and make all the best rugby
[1:10:57] team in history you can't take people
[1:10:59] from a generation to go and put them
[1:11:01] with the players today they would never
[1:11:03] ever be in the they wouldn't even be in
[1:11:05] the squad they're smaller they're weaker
[1:11:08] they're not as skilled amen
[1:11:11] you take okay so we had John Kirwan who
[1:11:15] who knows John Kirwan this is now I'm
[1:11:17] just showing where my era there's John
[1:11:21] Cohen he had the fend he had that fend
[1:11:23] Jonah Lomu picked up the same friend
[1:11:25] basically push the guy in the face as
[1:11:27] he's trying to tackle him John a lot
[1:11:30] John Kirwan was way smaller than Jonah
[1:11:32] Lomu but he's the same tactics because
[1:11:35] he drew inspiration from that that
[1:11:36] player that was the generation before
[1:11:38] what happened he drew from it became
[1:11:40] greater now why are you saying these
[1:11:44] things you have to be careful what
[1:11:46] you're looking at you ought to be
[1:11:48] careful what you're actually saying I
[1:11:51] want to be like right and us and and
[1:11:54] it's like the young ones and like the
[1:11:57] elephant herd or whatever heard the
[1:11:58] young ones are protected by the adults
[1:12:00] because the adults know what a lion is
[1:12:02] I'm going back to that story they've
[1:12:03] seen it they've experienced a lion
[1:12:05] trying to kill them they know what it's
[1:12:07] like and we know what it's like for a
[1:12:10] devil to try and kill us amen we know
[1:12:13] what suicides suicidal thoughts like
[1:12:16] depression is like I know what that's
[1:12:18] like I know it's a you know drinking and
[1:12:20] you know being having alcohol poisoning
[1:12:22] all terrible I know what it's like I
[1:12:24] know what that devil's like to try and
[1:12:26] kill me
[1:12:27] amen and we and you could identify any
[1:12:29] anything under the Sun even religious
[1:12:32] pride sure there's that
[1:12:33] Evil's tried to kill some of us trying
[1:12:35] to think we're something awesome that's
[1:12:37] just a devil trying to stop us what we
[1:12:39] what we mean to be holier than thou kind
[1:12:41] of attitude legalistic Pharisee that's a
[1:12:44] spirit and it will try and get you for
[1:12:47] Ken but to hear about it and to fight
[1:12:50] against this two different things
[1:12:52] fighting against you know mind battles
[1:12:54] and things spirits try to come in I know
[1:12:56] what it's like
[1:12:57] cuz I've seen that lion but how God is
[1:13:00] greater than any any demon power
[1:13:02] anywhere anytime hello
[1:13:05] peer pressure I know what that's like to
[1:13:07] overcome hallelujah try just I I just
[1:13:11] got to fit in we're gonna fit in we're
[1:13:15] gonna fit in because your friends will
[1:13:17] probably go become friends with someone
[1:13:18] else and where are you gonna be I just
[1:13:21] want to fit him with the crowd you know
[1:13:22] I probably told this before but one of
[1:13:24] my best drinking buddies at yuning I was
[1:13:26] at I was at so forth form what's fourth
[1:13:30] form nowadays year ten yet in here
[1:13:34] here's one of my mates a boarding school
[1:13:36] that I went to another school then he
[1:13:37] came to the same universities me I don't
[1:13:39] know we were the best buddies best
[1:13:42] drinking buddies the Lord got ahold of
[1:13:45] me and then the next time I didn't tell
[1:13:48] him anything about next time I saw him
[1:13:50] you know I said you know we're in the
[1:13:52] supermarket and it's like he didn't want
[1:13:54] to spend another second in my presence I
[1:13:56] didn't try and pour pour the gospel down
[1:14:00] to so nothing but what happened well I
[1:14:03] don't know we were he found other
[1:14:05] friends
[1:14:06] I just got dropped my friends left me so
[1:14:11] you gotta be careful who you try to
[1:14:13] identify identified the Lord Jesus
[1:14:14] Christ amen he'll see you through well
[1:14:17] I've just got to prove myself I just
[1:14:20] proved yourself with the Lord let him
[1:14:22] prove himself to you rather they meant
[1:14:25] Allegiant became isolated crying in the
[1:14:30] tombs cutting himself why people try and
[1:14:32] alleviate the pain and the misery
[1:14:34] they're earned by doing all sorts of
[1:14:36] stuff people get tattoos because it
[1:14:38] means something about some past
[1:14:39] something or they cut themselves or
[1:14:41] people do that today
[1:14:42] who is that from this it's actually a
[1:14:46] tormenting spirit
[1:14:47] Pisan here because somehow that a doors
[1:14:50] come open pain or something's happen and
[1:14:53] the devil steps into that pain and says
[1:14:55] now I'm gonna make room I'm gonna come
[1:14:57] live in this place and then it just gets
[1:14:59] worse and then he says come buddies this
[1:15:01] room for us all you know we say well we
[1:15:05] just gone through some stuff and
[1:15:06] actually many times it's just demon
[1:15:08] powers trying to have preeminence in our
[1:15:09] lives trying to take over you're gonna
[1:15:12] recognize that's not me I mean something
[1:15:16] that makes you feel useless worthless no
[1:15:18] place anywhere that's not you and it's
[1:15:21] certainly not God that is not the Lord
[1:15:23] Jesus Christ one but that's a demon
[1:15:26] trying to rob you of your life you've
[1:15:28] got a you got to identify what it is and
[1:15:31] it's not you saying that it's actually a
[1:15:34] devil amen I've seen that lyin
[1:15:40] but you gotta identify for us and it
[1:15:42] doesn't mean you're an unbeliever what's
[1:15:45] the first thing comes and the devil
[1:15:46] comes in with something and they say oh
[1:15:48] you just don't have it because of this
[1:15:50] oh no we have to fight everything we
[1:15:57] have to overcome something right you
[1:16:00] have to overcome the Lord member he was
[1:16:01] identify himself in your life so he's
[1:16:04] gonna give you things to overcome
[1:16:05] because he wants to manifest his
[1:16:08] overcoming power and you hallelujah now
[1:16:16] Legion brother brownie season from that
[1:16:20] time he says as a maniac one day up and
[1:16:24] get her who was cutting himself and they
[1:16:26] bound them and change and espousals 10
[1:16:28] times an ordinary man could break the
[1:16:30] powers of them chains you know we have
[1:16:33] changed today people try and cope with
[1:16:35] things and they're about this big it's a
[1:16:38] pill nothing wrong if you've got to take
[1:16:41] them but don't let it stay that way just
[1:16:44] to make something dormant you get rid of
[1:16:46] it they meant those things help but
[1:16:49] don't just say well this is means the
[1:16:51] rest of my life is just how it has to be
[1:16:52] I trust this is coming out okay I'm for
[1:16:56] medicine but God is the healer
[1:17:00] sometimes you just got to give God
[1:17:02] something to work with right because
[1:17:04] sometimes because remember God God is
[1:17:07] not a cookie cutter when David killed
[1:17:10] Goliath with a slingshot
[1:17:11] did he use that again no sir God came
[1:17:15] this so he killed the line in the beer
[1:17:16] angle either with a slingshot after that
[1:17:18] he never picks up a slingshot again he
[1:17:21] has a sword right and God shows them
[1:17:23] different ways to fight different
[1:17:24] enemies because god that's why God is
[1:17:26] sometimes he just incident like
[1:17:28] instantly answers your prayer God heal
[1:17:31] me of this gone hallelujah your faith
[1:17:34] has risen but then he wants to show you
[1:17:36] that's not the only way I'd do it
[1:17:38] because I want to mold character into
[1:17:40] you faith worketh patience writes and
[1:17:42] sometimes you may even get the same
[1:17:44] sickness Lord heal me I feel I have the
[1:17:47] same faith that's like there's nothing
[1:17:49] and you wait and there may be someone
[1:17:52] comes along and says well how's your
[1:17:55] diet it's God working you gotta be
[1:17:58] sensitive to God working you know maybe
[1:18:00] you got to change your diet or maybe you
[1:18:02] need to go see the doctor
[1:18:04] hallelujah and then you slowly get
[1:18:07] better or you come forward and get
[1:18:08] prayed for lay hands upon the sick and
[1:18:10] they shall recover or your parents pray
[1:18:12] for your son praise you lay hands on the
[1:18:14] sick they shall recover and you slowly
[1:18:16] get better it's the same God working in
[1:18:20] different ways amen
[1:18:24] so there was a maniac one day gather us
[1:18:27] I'll just read this again who is cutting
[1:18:29] himself and they bound him and changed
[1:18:30] and his power was ten times an ordinary
[1:18:32] man could break the powers of them
[1:18:34] chains I always thought if he was so
[1:18:36] perfectly under the influence of the
[1:18:37] devil when the devil takes hold of a
[1:18:39] person and saying it makes men and men
[1:18:42] to hold him he breaks them chains
[1:18:45] completely surrender to the devil if he
[1:18:48] could break chains how much more could
[1:18:50] we break completely surrender to God how
[1:18:53] much more powerful is God's power than
[1:18:55] the devil's there he was this poor
[1:18:57] maniac and he was always out there in
[1:19:00] the graveyard cutting himself with
[1:19:02] stones and attacked everybody but one
[1:19:05] day he met God things change for him
[1:19:06] after that he was clothed in his right
[1:19:09] mind why he had met God a leper stood by
[1:19:12] the gate begging one day
[1:19:14] excuse me one day Jesus Nazareth passed
[1:19:16] by and said if thou will thou can make
[1:19:19] me clean he said I will be thou clean
[1:19:20] and from then on he was clean so Jesus
[1:19:25] was Jesus was on his way to where that
[1:19:27] man was in the tombs we don't know how
[1:19:29] long he was in that condition but that
[1:19:31] doesn't matter
[1:19:33] amen he didn't start off one day he was
[1:19:36] saying a normal mix day in the tombs
[1:19:38] something happened to him open a door
[1:19:40] one devil God and a beast he got worse
[1:19:42] and worse and worse and he's found
[1:19:43] himself where he was but jesus knew
[1:19:46] where he was the resurrection and the
[1:19:48] life was actually making his way towards
[1:19:51] where that man was and it's the same
[1:19:53] thing today you've got no this is you
[1:19:55] got to recognize the same God that
[1:19:57] walked the shores of Galilee is exactly
[1:20:00] the same one here right the same Jesus
[1:20:03] it's not a different Jesus it's not a
[1:20:05] Lisa Jesus and is exactly he's the same
[1:20:09] in power he's the same in authority he's
[1:20:12] the same in deliverance he's the same in
[1:20:14] healing is the same in peace all that he
[1:20:16] is it's in the believer
[1:20:18] I remember program said all that God
[1:20:21] poured into Christ oh yeah yeah all that
[1:20:24] God was he bought himself into Christ
[1:20:26] and although he bought into Christ he
[1:20:28] poured into them he should say me
[1:20:33] hallelujah well the scripture says -
[1:20:35] were filled with the fullness of God
[1:20:37] hallelujah so exactly the same one is
[1:20:41] present in 2019 just not in his corporal
[1:20:45] body we're gonna meet that in the air
[1:20:46] hallelujah that's going to be a glorious
[1:20:48] time amen see season first Corinthians
[1:20:53] two and twelve how we have received not
[1:20:55] the spirit of the world but the Spirit
[1:20:57] which is of God that we might know the
[1:20:59] things which are freely given to us of
[1:21:01] God hallelujah which things also we
[1:21:05] speak not in the words which man's
[1:21:07] wisdom teacheth excuse me but which is
[1:21:13] the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[1:21:16] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[1:21:19] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:21:21] the Spirit of God for they are
[1:21:23] foolishness unto Him neither can he know
[1:21:25] them because they are spiritually
[1:21:27] discern but he that is spiritual judgeth
[1:21:29] all things yet himself as judged of no
[1:21:32] man for who hath known the mind of the
[1:21:34] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:21:36] have the mind of Christ I mean so the
[1:21:39] mind of Christ is in the people today
[1:21:42] they men we have the mind of Christ
[1:21:44] we're not guessing we know because it's
[1:21:47] been revealed to us I mean we know the
[1:21:49] things that are freely given to us of
[1:21:51] God why cuz we don't have the spirit of
[1:21:54] the world where the Spirit of God
[1:21:55] hallelujah so now if we know the things
[1:21:58] freely given unto us and we will go and
[1:22:00] get them we will become not just
[1:22:02] professors but possessors so a professor
[1:22:06] just says it's - - mind a possessor says
[1:22:08] I have it hallelujah just like Abraham
[1:22:11] with Isaac he says I've got him where is
[1:22:14] he he's coming he's here twenty-five
[1:22:16] years later his revelation became
[1:22:18] material that's the same thing with us
[1:22:21] we don't just say we have it we have it
[1:22:22] Memphis is a substance of things not
[1:22:25] seen in evidence of things hoped for I
[1:22:27] mean so and that word hope means an
[1:22:29] expectation so it's the evidence of
[1:22:31] things not seen
[1:22:32] that's the it's the expectation of the
[1:22:35] young sorry let's go to Hebrews 11 we'll
[1:22:43] get back to Legion Bron he's on his way
[1:22:47] now faith is the substance of things
[1:22:51] hoped for so it's the substance as the
[1:22:55] evidence of things expected for the
[1:22:58] evidence of things not seen
[1:23:00] so faith is not a hope so that you know
[1:23:04] you haven't Amen it's an evidence it's a
[1:23:07] proof that you have it and it's and it's
[1:23:11] things that would hope is an expectation
[1:23:13] usually with pleasure so you know it you
[1:23:16] know you're actually expecting it as we
[1:23:18] heard on Wednesday expectation faith
[1:23:20] gives us expectation hallelujah so now
[1:23:23] if the Spirit of the Lord reveals to us
[1:23:26] the things freely given to us of God
[1:23:27] what does it do
[1:23:28] it gives us an evidence that we have it
[1:23:31] the things that are expected hallelujah
[1:23:34] so you know if you're sitting Legion in
[1:23:38] the tombs ya gotta have an expectation
[1:23:39] this is not my
[1:23:40] final destination the devil may have
[1:23:42] robbed me may have done all kinds of
[1:23:44] things to me I may be in the state but
[1:23:46] Jesus is on his way and Jesus is here
[1:23:49] now hallelujah
[1:23:52] Susan Philippians 4 invoice is rejoice
[1:23:55] in the Lord always and again I say
[1:23:57] rejoice let your moderation be known
[1:23:59] unto all men the the Lord is at hand
[1:24:02] it says be careful for nothing now that
[1:24:06] would careful it means to be anxious
[1:24:08] about so be anxious about nothing don't
[1:24:12] be stressed don't be worried don't be
[1:24:15] concerned and now that doesn't mean
[1:24:17] don't be no it doesn't say basically so
[1:24:21] don't be blase yeah it comes goes
[1:24:25] whatever sweet as she'll be right that's
[1:24:27] not what this is saying it's saying
[1:24:29] don't be anxious don't get stressed
[1:24:31] about it how's this going to happen
[1:24:32] I don't know God said God said in his
[1:24:36] word it's become revealed to me I know
[1:24:38] it's going to happen hallelujah so don't
[1:24:41] be anxious about nothing but in
[1:24:43] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:24:45] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[1:24:48] known unto God and the peace of God
[1:24:51] which passes all understanding shall
[1:24:53] keep your hearts and minds through
[1:24:54] Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever
[1:24:57] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:24:59] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:25:01] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:25:03] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:25:04] of a good report if there be any virtue
[1:25:07] if there be any praise think on these
[1:25:09] things those things which he have both
[1:25:12] learned and received and heard and seen
[1:25:14] in me do and the God of peace shall be
[1:25:18] with you hallelujah
[1:25:21] so he shouldn't be anxious about nothing
[1:25:23] just walk on with God whatever is going
[1:25:25] on just walk on with him but Legion came
[1:25:28] to his place in this life where
[1:25:29] something happened to him and it allowed
[1:25:31] a devil to come and he was a believer
[1:25:34] but then this happened to him and he
[1:25:37] found himself going in a downward cycle
[1:25:38] where he then he eventually found
[1:25:40] himself crying depressed alone cutting
[1:25:44] himself and that surrounded by death I
[1:25:48] meant you you see people
[1:25:52] do you not people some some people wear
[1:25:56] black because they like the color other
[1:25:57] people wear black because they're
[1:25:58] actually surrounded by death amen
[1:26:02] that's how was it my day Goths emos
[1:26:04] skulls death black whatever yeah what
[1:26:08] it's actually a spirit they didn't stay
[1:26:11] you know often I you know you know you
[1:26:12] see people they never you know people on
[1:26:16] the street they never how they are now
[1:26:18] they never started that way
[1:26:19] there was some little girl some little
[1:26:22] dad's little bundle of joy someone's
[1:26:25] sweetheart some mother's little bundle
[1:26:28] of joy they never started how they
[1:26:31] finished or how they are right now
[1:26:33] something happened to them which caused
[1:26:35] them to end up that way even even people
[1:26:39] who seem to be very successful but what
[1:26:41] they do if they basically get rid of
[1:26:44] their families they'll just get rid of
[1:26:46] whatever that stands in their ambition
[1:26:47] in the way of their ambition
[1:26:49] I don't believe they started that way
[1:26:51] but something came in so now I'm just
[1:26:54] trying to cover every aspect of society
[1:26:56] we can be here in George Street we say
[1:26:59] what happened to them or he can be the
[1:27:01] richest person in the world well what
[1:27:03] happened to them
[1:27:04] because all they want is greed and make
[1:27:06] a name for themselves and fame and you
[1:27:08] know something happened to both those
[1:27:10] people which was bad to the world one is
[1:27:13] great and one is not but it's bad things
[1:27:15] of it because why they get rid of their
[1:27:17] families they cut you know they cut bad
[1:27:19] deals they do all kinds of terrible
[1:27:20] things and it's all out of selfishness
[1:27:23] what happened they never say yeah you
[1:27:27] take little children they're all lovely
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:32] and they they give me little
[1:27:34] two-by-fours but they're wonderful
[1:27:35] things you know but then you look at
[1:27:38] that and you just go a few years and you
[1:27:40] go well what happened from they were
[1:27:42] like this and then now they're like this
[1:27:44] we know it's because sure we are born in
[1:27:47] a fallen state but the devil comes in
[1:27:50] and just cripples people up and that's
[1:27:57] not what we meant to be
[1:27:59] Legion was not meant to be Legion bad
[1:28:03] things happened to us all
[1:28:05] those people out there the bride all the
[1:28:08] same things happened to us we can't stop
[1:28:11] it we can't stop bad things happening
[1:28:14] even if we even if we said okay friends
[1:28:16] I've just bought a hundred hectares in
[1:28:19] the back of a Katara we're all off the
[1:28:21] grid bad things will still happen you
[1:28:24] can't escape the world naturally people
[1:28:27] try and they prep and they do whatever
[1:28:28] you can't escape the bat because the
[1:28:30] Devils in here right but it's how you
[1:28:34] allow it to affect you how you respond
[1:28:39] can God
[1:28:40] identify himself in your response even
[1:28:43] to your enemy he said love your enemies
[1:28:46] do good to them that you know treat you
[1:28:49] badly can you do that and then God says
[1:28:52] I cannot anoint that life as you treat
[1:28:55] them that way amen so he ended up
[1:29:00] brother and says one so one day way down
[1:29:03] and land of Gator I know no doubt a
[1:29:04] sociable god-fearing citizen once lived
[1:29:07] he got out with the wrong crowd maybe
[1:29:09] just married and had two or three little
[1:29:11] kitties but he got mixed up in the wrong
[1:29:14] group and that's where many a young man
[1:29:16] and young woman loses out getting mixed
[1:29:18] up in the wrong group the wrong
[1:29:20] associates and so one day they'd taken
[1:29:23] him out give him a drink I played a
[1:29:24] little game will do this gamble a little
[1:29:26] it won't hurt then the first devil
[1:29:28] entered him he went home and has to tell
[1:29:31] his wife a lie the second devil entered
[1:29:34] him and until he was possessed with a
[1:29:37] legion and he got beyond any help and
[1:29:40] the poor fellow was drove out into the
[1:29:42] tombs but then Jesus came I'm just gonna
[1:29:47] wrap this up but then Jesus came but
[1:29:50] then there was worship but it was the
[1:29:52] devil worshipping God it wasn't the man
[1:29:56] that was worshiping because Jesus asked
[1:29:59] him who are you
[1:30:00] we're legion for him any it wasn't the
[1:30:02] man speaking it was the devil in him
[1:30:05] worshiping but the life that was being
[1:30:08] lived behind that worship wasn't wasn't
[1:30:11] a God living life
[1:30:13] amen help us Lord Jesus and brother BAM
[1:30:16] says now it comes down like an like in
[1:30:18] Jesus day there were the disciples and
[1:30:21] they were the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:30:22] were pole opposite one had joy peace God
[1:30:26] living the other was dead formal
[1:30:28] powerless proud arrogant people but but
[1:30:31] but brother and says now adays it comes
[1:30:33] to this he calls it the thin edge of the
[1:30:34] wedge so it comes down to the very close
[1:30:39] where the people can say the same thing
[1:30:42] they can quote the same prophet they can
[1:30:44] say amen to the same quotes they can aim
[1:30:46] in the same scripture they can quote the
[1:30:48] same scripture but one has the life of
[1:30:53] the word and the other does not that's
[1:30:58] the thin edge of the which it's when God
[1:31:02] comes down identifies himself anew what
[1:31:05] is the purpose of what is the purpose of
[1:31:08] this that he would live in people that
[1:31:13] is that is what is Christianity God
[1:31:15] living in man
[1:31:17] that is the purpose why did he die that
[1:31:19] he would live in you data would go from
[1:31:22] quoting to living remember brother you
[1:31:25] know I think it's brother on Spencer
[1:31:27] said you know God's not going to wrap
[1:31:28] your Bibles your Bible will stay here
[1:31:31] your message books will stay here your
[1:31:33] tablets will stay here hallelujah
[1:31:36] I mean those things will stay here but
[1:31:38] God is going to rapture human beings
[1:31:40] that are full of his presence full of
[1:31:43] his word that is the only thing going in
[1:31:45] the rapture as when God can identify
[1:31:47] himself in the life and say that's part
[1:31:50] of me upon the earth I'm not leaving it
[1:31:52] on the earth no more they're coming to
[1:31:54] where I am hallelujah so it's the thin
[1:31:58] each of the which what life are you
[1:32:02] producing you can say all the right
[1:32:04] things you know we can have this church
[1:32:07] perfect some churches as a doctrine
[1:32:10] you've got to wear a certain time that
[1:32:12] is right so we could we could be
[1:32:15] outwardly perfect perfect but as God
[1:32:19] here
[1:32:20] as God here I would rather pick up and
[1:32:26] Magento's and jeans if that's all I had
[1:32:29] if that's the best I had and God live I
[1:32:31] know that's an extreme case but I've
[1:32:33] been and I've been in Papua New Guinea
[1:32:35] literally wearing just gendell's yo
[1:32:38] t-shirt and you know not a tie and this
[1:32:41] stuff God comes down speaks to those
[1:32:44] people those things that I don't they
[1:32:47] have even seen here hallelujah it's our
[1:32:50] attitude towards the word that matters
[1:32:52] I'm not discounting wearing this right I
[1:32:55] think it's good but you know but it's
[1:32:57] our attitude we can be all outwardly
[1:33:00] right with a stinking attitude trying to
[1:33:02] destroy one another speaking ill of one
[1:33:04] another tearing one another down you
[1:33:06] know unhappy discontented strife envy
[1:33:10] going through what is that but yet
[1:33:12] worship what is that that's legion thank
[1:33:16] you what else is it it's not God and
[1:33:20] kind of God and kind of God than kind of
[1:33:21] not God than the devil it's God or Satan
[1:33:25] two different ones but here it was he
[1:33:34] went out where the dead were don't be an
[1:33:38] individual ated in your family don't
[1:33:42] because that leads to a slippery slope
[1:33:44] you'll end up like this
[1:33:46] and you'll be tormenting you know I
[1:33:47] tried to drink my own happiness away
[1:33:50] didn't work people who try and do way
[1:33:53] worse of things but I tried to drown it
[1:33:55] you know it doesn't help that there's no
[1:33:58] lasting satisfaction been there done
[1:34:01] that got the scars wish I never had to
[1:34:04] but God allows it and God allows you to
[1:34:07] remember it because that will keep you
[1:34:09] thankful that you're delivered Powler
[1:34:11] that's why we clear that's why we don't
[1:34:13] rejoice and what we once did but we
[1:34:16] rejoice that we're free
[1:34:18] that's why God told the children of
[1:34:20] Israel tell your children your
[1:34:21] children's children what you came out of
[1:34:23] your slaves you're beaten you are just a
[1:34:26] tool in the Pharaohs hand tell them
[1:34:28] where you came from that's why we're
[1:34:30] going to always tell our children where
[1:34:32] we came from they may not understand it
[1:34:35] be say this is what I once was and this
[1:34:38] is why I want nothing to do with it
[1:34:39] because it bound me up it twisted me up
[1:34:42] and gave me trouble in my mind I had no
[1:34:44] peace I had to erase I had no joy
[1:34:46] nothing lost that nothing was satisfying
[1:34:48] I thought I found it that it just fell
[1:34:50] apart I thought I found it I fell apart
[1:34:52] I went here tried this win it tried this
[1:34:55] win it tried this
[1:34:56] nothing satisfied until one day the Lord
[1:34:58] Jesus came in my life transformed me and
[1:35:01] now I found peace now I found
[1:35:03] satisfaction now I found joy now I found
[1:35:06] love now found acceptance and I never
[1:35:09] never never never never never never
[1:35:11] never want to go back never ever
[1:35:14] you could honestly I would rather be
[1:35:18] homeless on the street with the
[1:35:20] revelation of Jesus Christ then the
[1:35:23] richest richest man in all the world
[1:35:25] hallelujah you say well wolf I had a
[1:35:29] billion dollars what could I do and what
[1:35:32] then everyone it doesn't matter how rich
[1:35:35] say I have great technology is there
[1:35:38] come to a point where the stops beating
[1:35:41] this stops and there's words pronounced
[1:35:44] over their body they did time of death
[1:35:47] and then what you got to think about it
[1:35:53] you say well why are you going this way
[1:35:57] we have life we have the greatest the
[1:36:02] greatest thing is eternal life
[1:36:05] lelou you you know if I tell this wrong
[1:36:09] I'm sorry but your brother Ferdie was
[1:36:11] telling me a testimony of his mum and so
[1:36:14] she was having an operation not that
[1:36:16] long ago and she actually had an
[1:36:17] out-of-body experience and she had no
[1:36:21] fear just had peace was so happy and
[1:36:23] then she was actually going up above you
[1:36:26] up into heaven and she looked down and
[1:36:28] she saw all the people
[1:36:31] people in Auckland or burdened down like
[1:36:33] this but then he's but then she saw
[1:36:36] where where the youth were doing
[1:36:38] outreach and their singing and brother
[1:36:40] Zion singing about love will conquer the
[1:36:42] world or love is what the world needs
[1:36:44] our young singing about the Lord and all
[1:36:46] those people that heard heard that heard
[1:36:48] that singing and saw the believers they
[1:36:50] stood up straight the burdens kind of
[1:36:52] left them there happy and before this
[1:36:55] brother Ferdie said that he was
[1:36:57] wondering is the outreach doing anything
[1:36:59] hey they didn't understand the
[1:37:01] supernatural part of it and then she was
[1:37:05] about and then she got taken up she's
[1:37:06] about to go through the gates into
[1:37:07] heaven but then a voice said to her your
[1:37:10] purpose on earth is not done and now
[1:37:13] she's back alive on the earth but she
[1:37:16] had and you can ask Christine about when
[1:37:18] she nearly departed this world no fear
[1:37:22] peace didn't really want to come back
[1:37:26] why is that cause the sudden question is
[1:37:29] sidled hallelujah so it doesn't matter
[1:37:32] what happens to this thing blessed
[1:37:35] assurance Jesus is mine I what a
[1:37:37] foretaste of glory divine oh yeah he
[1:37:45] says I'll just finish with this I don't
[1:37:47] want to be too much longer but see this
[1:37:49] poor fellow he was drove out into the
[1:37:51] tombs the deep place and they bound him
[1:37:54] with chains and they could and he could
[1:37:56] pluck them asunder now when the devil
[1:37:57] possesses a person he becomes me times
[1:37:59] of strength and if a devil can give you
[1:38:01] twice your strength what do you what do
[1:38:04] you think God could do for people
[1:38:05] sitting here in a wheelchair what do you
[1:38:07] think God could do to you that's a
[1:38:08] sinner if the devil can drive you into a
[1:38:11] barroom will get you into the street
[1:38:12] immorally or doing the things of the
[1:38:15] world which is contrary to your own
[1:38:16] nature because you were born to be a son
[1:38:19] and daughter of God now I'll just say
[1:38:22] this I used to the weekend for me
[1:38:25] started on a Wednesday ended on Monday
[1:38:29] we would go out into town this is this
[1:38:32] is in Christchurch everyone's like
[1:38:34] basically the whole University was it
[1:38:36] the other night life was what they call
[1:38:38] pumping
[1:38:38] I remember going there once being sober
[1:38:41] and I was singing this is madness wasn't
[1:38:44] even a Christian
[1:38:45] and why because you got to come under
[1:38:47] the influence of something to enjoy it
[1:38:49] and that's how many people yeah many
[1:38:52] things in the world you got to actually
[1:38:53] become drunk or stoned or high or
[1:38:55] whatever to enjoy it you know and many
[1:38:58] people they needed they need a drink in
[1:39:00] their hand to actually become sociable
[1:39:03] why why do you need a substance to fit
[1:39:06] into somewhere you know God didn't God
[1:39:10] and Mac now you gotta have this to fit
[1:39:13] in in the world you following me you
[1:39:16] know but but that's how the world is you
[1:39:18] got to be drunk and stoned or high
[1:39:19] whatever you got to be on something
[1:39:20] uppers downers whatever you know to to
[1:39:22] cope to fit in we don't want to be that
[1:39:26] way
[1:39:27] you know when you're in it you think
[1:39:29] it's awesome but when you can look
[1:39:30] soberly whether you think man that's
[1:39:31] crazy
[1:39:33] let's be sober-minded hallelujah now
[1:39:40] because seat which is contrary to your
[1:39:42] own nature cause you were born to be a
[1:39:44] son and daughter of God and the devil
[1:39:46] could make you do things and cheat on
[1:39:47] your husband cheat on your wife steal
[1:39:49] cheat lie how much more can God do when
[1:39:51] he gets full position of you and this
[1:39:53] fellow Legion wants a gentleman no hopes
[1:39:55] now he's out in the tombs with the devil
[1:39:57] and year after year he got worse and
[1:39:59] worse and he got so that no man could
[1:40:01] pass that way no he didn't want to hurt
[1:40:03] anyone he knew better than to do that
[1:40:05] but every time he's seen someone the
[1:40:08] devil would jump on him and he would go
[1:40:10] and try and kill that person till every
[1:40:12] one feed him he was X community from the
[1:40:16] from the city the devil had drove him
[1:40:19] out of his mind and he was out in the
[1:40:20] tomb the darkest hour he had ever seen
[1:40:23] and then Jesus came along and he cast
[1:40:26] the Devils out of him and those Devils
[1:40:29] went into a herd of hogs and they had
[1:40:31] sense enough to drown themselves I often
[1:40:33] wondered when I get to heaven I'd like
[1:40:35] to see how much strength his testimony
[1:40:37] had against hog raisers in that country
[1:40:40] after that you know I often think about
[1:40:43] it there were 2,000 hogs drowned that's
[1:40:48] a lot of pigs it's not just one or two
[1:40:50] that's a mass drowning that was a big
[1:40:52] thing but when the when when the hog
[1:40:56] raisers began to testify that this man
[1:40:58] of
[1:40:58] being delivered but the Hogs are drowned
[1:41:00] it was in such a way that the people of
[1:41:03] the city didn't want Jesus around he
[1:41:06] says and that's they didn't want any
[1:41:07] revival think I'll said this is they
[1:41:10] didn't want any revival if it was going
[1:41:12] to cost them some hogs they felt more at
[1:41:15] home with the Hogs and the Devils than
[1:41:17] they did with the Lord Jesus
[1:41:18] they wanted their hogs and asked him to
[1:41:21] leave crazy and that's the way it is
[1:41:24] tonight people would rather stay in
[1:41:26] their old stale formal ungodly
[1:41:28] indifferent condition than to put up
[1:41:30] with a little wild fire now and then I'd
[1:41:33] rather have a thousand times to one they
[1:41:35] feel better at home with the devils and
[1:41:38] in their old condition drinking smoking
[1:41:39] gambling wearing old dirty clothes and
[1:41:42] bobbing off their hair and doing all
[1:41:44] this other stuff that they do feel more
[1:41:46] at home doing that and they that then
[1:41:48] you do to be called old-fashioned and
[1:41:50] have Jesus around the house I'll take
[1:41:53] him a hundred billion times to one the
[1:41:56] darkest hour then Jesus came along could
[1:41:58] you imagine Legion going back to his
[1:42:00] home
[1:42:01] finding where he used to live the little
[1:42:03] wife had to sell the place he wanted to
[1:42:05] wish yours at so he searched from place
[1:42:08] to place finally someone said she lives
[1:42:10] down the alley and when he goes down
[1:42:12] there and the old little tin shack then
[1:42:14] when the children see him coming they
[1:42:16] run to hide the wife grabbed up a little
[1:42:19] shawl put it on her and started out the
[1:42:21] gate he said never mind honey never mind
[1:42:23] children come here to Daddy I want you
[1:42:26] to take I want to take you in my arms I
[1:42:27] want to put my arms around you
[1:42:30] sweetheart
[1:42:31] your little dresses are tore off oh she
[1:42:33] said what happened he said Jesus came
[1:42:36] along that's what made the difference
[1:42:38] our wife babies come here it was the
[1:42:41] darkest time the Devils were to
[1:42:43] tormenting me and then Jesus came along
[1:42:47] that's more than a story that's more
[1:42:50] than a that's more than a story that's
[1:42:52] more than someone else's testimony he's
[1:42:55] the same God today however he can do the
[1:42:58] same deliverance that man was out of his
[1:43:00] mind
[1:43:01] he couldn't pray he couldn't seek
[1:43:03] deliverance but some one of us he was
[1:43:05] praying for him amen and Jesus came
[1:43:08] along and that same Jesus can do the
[1:43:10] same deliverance maybe to those you say
[1:43:13] well there's no hope for them hold on
[1:43:15] hold on just let Jesus go along and
[1:43:18] you'll see they won't end up that way
[1:43:22] hallelujah just let Jesus come along you
[1:43:26] gotta just only belief hallelujah don't
[1:43:29] put don't put conditions it can't be
[1:43:31] done no it can be done if Jesus can can
[1:43:34] deliver that man if Jesus can deliver
[1:43:37] the Apostle Paul up to here in religion
[1:43:39] if Jesus can heal the woman deliver the
[1:43:42] woman at the world all these examples in
[1:43:44] when going all the way through the
[1:43:45] message people blaspheme people that all
[1:43:47] kinds of things but Jesus came along and
[1:43:50] delivered them gave them peace gave them
[1:43:52] salvation he's still the same God today
[1:43:55] hallelujah we say it's nothing's
[1:43:58] happened just wait just let Jesus come
[1:44:01] along how Louie's mighty to save amen
[1:44:06] absolutely can we have the musicians
[1:44:08] please hallelujah say well I feel
[1:44:22] isolated my family doesn't understand me
[1:44:24] no one knows what I'm going through
[1:44:25] these people here could never put
[1:44:27] themselves in my shoes you'd be
[1:44:29] surprised you'd be shocked quite frankly
[1:44:34] if everyone stood up and gave the
[1:44:38] testimony didn't just just sugarcoat it
[1:44:40] a little bit and actually see how it
[1:44:41] really was you'd be shocked you mean you
[1:44:45] went through that you actually did that
[1:44:47] you actually enjoyed that in your fallen
[1:44:50] state I'll be honest
[1:44:53] now you're born you're born and fallen
[1:44:56] state I enjoyed what I want what I once
[1:44:59] was and my fallen state
[1:45:01] but then Jesus came along and the things
[1:45:03] I once did I can't do not because I have
[1:45:06] to keep myself in or what will people
[1:45:08] think no that's not that's not it and he
[1:45:11] changes your nature that what you once
[1:45:13] loved you hate and once you hated you
[1:45:15] when you now love and you can't help but
[1:45:18] it's like he just flicks a switch
[1:45:19] why because you give all your heart to
[1:45:22] him but if you come to him but you've
[1:45:24] actually got some fire exit to run
[1:45:26] through he'll never take you you'll be
[1:45:30] willing to say Lord every bridge has
[1:45:32] been burned there's no turning back Here
[1:45:35] I am
[1:45:36] and Jesus will come along hallelujah
[1:45:41] let's dance shall we let's just give him
[1:45:43] thanks aren't you this is Thanksgiving
