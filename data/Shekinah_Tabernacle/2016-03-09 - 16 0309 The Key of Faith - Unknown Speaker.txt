hearer Lord we pray please in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen amen hallelujah amen God bless you friends thank you musicians hallelujah amen amen that's right amen God bless you if you'd like to turn with me to First Peter and we'll just read uh verses 3 and 4 then we're going to go to Revelations chapter I believe it's chapter 3 go to the Philadelphia age oh here here that's all right bless you okay so second Peter chapter 1 and verses 3 and 4 it's good to see everyone out tonight amen amen it says here now let's just read from verse one of 2 Peter chapter 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given us according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us succeeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen hallelujah and then we'll go to Revelations chapter 3 and then we'll go to uh Revelations 3:7 and it says here and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before the an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and has not denied my name amen may the Lord bless his word you may be seated amen now I want to I want to take a just a uh couple of a couple of uh words there from that scripture we read in second Peter about exceeding exceeding great and precious promises now this is not a service of positive thinking but God has given us something in this age that is very different you know it's incredible when you just when you just listen to the message in you and you just see how it unfolds not only not only does it unfold to you but it's it's unfolding to the prophet of the Lord as God is revealing himself and it's incredible that we could be standing here in this age where the word has become open to us you know we're not we're not just you know we're not wondering who we are we're not wondering what Jesus has done you know we we know who we are in Christ amen we know our position in Christ and we know what God has made us and and it's important because you know we have we have as as as brother Bram he heard brother Neville preach and he and and brother Neville preached about it's like a big arcade it's like a big you know you know you go into the arcade then you have a look around you know what's there and what belongs to you and it's the same thing with the word of God you know we should look into the word to see what belongs to us amen we shouldn't just say it looks nice and isn't that pretty isn't that neat we should go in see what belongs to us and try it out amen it's like if you had your favorite kind of store and you said here's the you can do whatever you want you just wouldn't open the front door and close again say that was neat you'd go in there amen you'd take supplies with you and you'd say hey I'm busy for a few probably a few years maybe I don't know and you would open every box you'd try everything Hallelujah and you'd probably try it till it breaks the things you really like amen so now we you know you just take that and you take it into the word of God we have exceeding great and precious promises and I read that scripture in um in Revelations there because we must understand that the ages lap from one into another and so the blessings of all the evil and everything that's been building from the first age has built down to now and all the blessings to the believer have built from the first age down to now and so when when it was declared to the Philadelphian age there you know we know this is John Wesley Age The Great missionary age that age overlaps into this this age and so Jesus now is saying behold I set before you an open door and that open door we understand where Jesus would say in John chap 10 he'd say I am the door amen he says I am the door to the Sheep amen so this door that was set before them was an escape out of the world saying now I'm going to open a door of Revelation that you can escape this world and he was actually saying this open door cuz he is the door and this is the age because the you know the the Revelation and the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ that was before isusa Street amen it was right at the end of that uh Philadelphia age where these things were unfolding so God was now declaring behold I I set before you an open door that no man can shut and yo y he yo let's just I'm going to read that again because we must understand the devil cannot take anything from us amen amen he says here he that is true and he at the Key of David and he that shutteth no man I mean he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth so what he's saying is that what whatever God has revealed the devil can't take it away from the bright amen the devil can't steal what is what is your god-given rights Hallelujah he can't he can't steal God back away in history amen if he has if he has revealed himself in this age and he has Hallelujah then then then the devil can't smother him away amen so what God has opened the devil cannot shut and what and what God has shut the devil cannot open Hallelujah so we have we have an exceeding great and precious promises in this age now I just want to read this is really the door now brother B preaches a a service and it's called the key to the door amen yes sir the key to the door there's only one door and that is Jesus Christ amen he is the door amen amen so there's only there's only one door now I'm just going to read this this is basically my whole sermon is in this right here and I just because I was thinking you know in the Book of James be not just hearers of the word but doers and sometimes we think do is asn't dress right speak right clean up your house but a do is actually putting this word into action amen where Faith puts legs on and actually lives out the word that is being a doer of the word hallelujah where where where you're sick you say buy Stripes I'll be made well amen and you actually put legs on your faith it's not just speaking about it but actually lay hold that's right Hallelujah of what belongs to you amen hey we've got an arcade I've heard this before we've got an arcade have you searched that well I I've gone down this aisle hallelujah what about this aisle amen what about oh I've been healed what about this aisle amen amen well I believe my own salvation go down this island what about the salvation for your family amen because because brother Ram tells the same Faith you have for yourself to get saved apply to your family Hallelujah yes sir he says there's not another name given under heaven whereby you must be saved only through the name of Jesus Christ no church no denomination no read no do doctrines of anything only through jesus' name this is the key amen amen no wonder Peter could use one of them on the day of Pentecost they wanted to know how to get into that door he used the key and there's only one key because there is only just one door I am the door Jesus said and Peter had the key to it and he said now he's going to show how the keys used he says repent everyone one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the treasures of God it's the key to the door and Jesus is the door there's only one door to healing and Jesus is that door there's only one door to peace yay my peace I give you he's the only door to genuine peace you might think you've got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children clothes have food to eat but you might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular amongst people but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one peace that's Jesus is the peace he is our peace he is our healing I am the Lord thy God that heals all your diseases he is the door to Heaven there's no other the door or no other way but through Jesus Christ he is the door to heaven and now Jesus is the door of all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all these promises Faith now I just wish I had this in you know massive massive text here right here faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God see the key is Faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that faith in his finished work it's these keys that we're speaking on right amen so faith in his finished work amen we'll open every door we'll open the door un need Hallelujah faith in his finished work because we see that you know when Adam and Eve were upon the Earth before there was sin they had Direct communion with God they had perfect Fellowship but then sin we know made a Chasm and it separ separated God and man but then when Jesus came he reconciled heavens and earth am mean heavens and earth are reconciled in one man amen hallelujah and then so and so he had to give us life to bridge that Chasm that as we as we uh as I mentioned the quote last Sunday that his blood puts us back on speaking terms again it puts us back in that condition amen so it's his finished work that Bridges the chasm that God and man can become one again and that man could have that key of Faith again and open the door of everything they have need of cuz we see Adam Adam you know he had control over the Earth he could just speak and things would move amen because Jesus demonstrated everything Adam lost Jesus was demonstrating everything that he had amen he he had control over nature he had control over life he brought you know he he everything he was in Supreme control over everything in his environment amen even even the you know the soldiers and things that came to get him in the Garden of Gethsemane they didn't you know they didn't take him he says I give my life I Lay My Life down no no man takes it from me but I lay it down and the prophet says you can say that amen you can actually say that because if he if that was the man what about the woman if he was under Supreme control are he following me if he is under Supreme control and you read that in the Garden they all come in with their swords and their staves and armed men and and he just asked a question who do you seek Jesus Nar us I here they all fall down backwards then they get back up who do you seek Jesus of Nazareth and they fall back down amen he had to actually get consent to be taken amen that's right Hallelujah here's here's the devil coming in the power of Darkness Amen to take our Lord and he had to actually consent for for for them to take him away amen cuz he was and that was remember in the garden the left him he went from that before that moment he went as a man cuz God can't die you following me amen so he was he had Supreme control over every circumstance hallelujah amen and then now he he demonstrated that because he's going to he demonstrating to a people in the end time this is how you're going to be and he showed this in the life of the Prophet amen amen where where sure you can see maturing through his ministry but he came to a point where he could Master every circumstance that's right amen you see you hear the bar you know you know you know you hear the testimonies that say you know he just he just knew how to handle every situation why is that because he's a man who has had Mastery over every circumstance amen that's and that was done to show this is what you're going to become amen hallelujah hallelujah so now the the key of Faith opens every door every Divine promise is opened by the key of faith and this is very important to us because we must understand that God in this end time has taken away all the Creeds and dogmas amen he's taken away everything that is a lie of the Creeds of man and he's taken it away that man is not believing into a church you know through a church and through that church they might receive you forgiveness of sins but now he's taken that away that God that man can have a genuine faith in the genuine Lamb of God amen amen Methodist have their own interpretation of the Bible and they believe that but it's Creeds of man mixed with the scripture and you know you take that to every denomination there's the Creeds of man have mixed in that and the people believe that amen but there came a time where God would do away with the Creeds of man and he would reveal himself saying here is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen amen amen hallelujah so now it actually takes away it takes away what God I mean what man has added to it and so and this is very important you say well why is it why do it matter what we believe Jesus said by teaching the Commandments and doctrines of men you make the word of God no effect to the people amen so that means if you teach the pure word of God you make the Commandments of God effective to the people amen so now we're not believing in we're not believing just in in the cre of man or the mind of a man but God has revealed himself therefore because if I believe in the if I put my faith in the wrong thing I'm not going to get the results I think I should get amen right but if you put your faith in the right thing then you get the results you believe you should get am amen right so if if he has revealed himself and you put faith in him amen then you will get the results you need amen amen amen he says this in the Feast of the trumpets he begins to speak about you know you the two witnesses of of of Moses and Elias he says in Revelations 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elias calling to Israel out of Jewish Traditions just as the seventh Angel's message called The Bride out of the Pentecostal tradition remember Moses and Elijah is to call Israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the LI to the Real Living Sacrifice to the word and the seventh Angels message under the same trumpet same exact everything the same seal as to what call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word had made flesh Among Us amen so he's saying that Malachi for's Ministry is to turn the people from Creeds and dogmas to a genuine faith in God Amen Hallelujah am because if you're trying if you're probing the wrong door you're going to get the wrong thing that's right amen so just like if I wanted to get into my house but I'm trying to get to the next door neighbor's house well I'm not going to get into my house right and many people unfortunately think they have the key of Faith but they're trying to put it in the wrong door that's right amen and they're not getting the results they think they should be getting well why not because they're putting the key of faith in the wrong door that's why people need to stop and look at their lives why are not things being produced you know you can take that individually Church wherever you say why why are things not being how they should be well what door are they putting the key in amen is it genuine revelation of the hours that things man's injected right amen so now if we have that genuine if we have the genuine door remember the door is Jesus Jesus is the word we have the genuine door do you believe it amen amen do you believe it's been declared amen so if we if we have the genuine door amen and we have faith to open that door then everything that God has for us is available amen amen we have the ability to open because remember he says he says here that faith in the finished in his finished work will open every what does that Encompass every promise of God Amen faith in his finished work remember in the Old Testament when the worshipper brought the lamb to the priest the priest wasn't looking at the worshipper even if he knew him and oh that's Jones from down the road and this is where he's from and you know he wasn't looking at him he looked at the lamb and if the lamb was accepted the worshipper was accepted amen the worshipper didn't even come into account of it it was the lamb Hallelujah it was the lamb that was accepted and that's all the priest was worried about and if the lamb was accepted the worshipper was accepted amen hallelujah so that's why it's not faith in you he said faith in his finished work faith in what he did on Calvary will open every promise to you Hallelujah hey we don't need to worry about what you know how good we think we are you know we have to we have to come to a place like Jacob did Jacob Jacob knew he wasn't worthy to receive the birthright but he just denied himself covered himself in skins and and denied his own self when he came in before his blind prophet Daddy he says who is that he says I'm your I'm your son Esau and then he felt them all over you you feel like Esau you you smell like Esau but you sound like Jacob you sure you Esau yes I am he denied his own self he had no right to receive that Birthright that's right amen you had no right to receive the birthright either amen but he covered himself in skins he denied himself amen and God has provided a covering in this end time Hallelujah the blood of the Lamb to cover you amen that you can deny your own self you may be around school it doesn't matter you know when the wedding Feast is being called Amen Hallelujah Jesus makes up a parable he speaks about the feast and he says he says you know you know a king great king Had A Feast for his son you know a great feast and he says call the good call the bad amen it comes down remember the first set They didn't accept their invitation then they went to the highway you you they went to another place is there's still room go to the highways call the good call the bad call the indifferent it doesn't matter amen hallelujah it doesn't matter what condition we think we're in have you received the invitation yes I received my invitation amen Jacob had to deny his own self even if he thought he was better than Esau he had to deny his own self he had to put on a charade to get what he needed that's right amen and you may think you don't deserve it but that doesn't matter amen you got to deny your own self and say I am righteous amen I am actually worthy to receive what I've come to get amen that's what that's what Jacob did he wasn't worthy firstborn son he wasn't even brought into account but he denied his birth hallelujah hallelujah he denied his first birth amen amen and he and he said this is me this is who I really meant to be amen amen what about you that's right that's right what about you Hallelujah you got to I'm not worthy who cares amen kick that idea out right now I fail every day who cares Hallelujah amen amen if he has called you has he called you you might just answer the question I've been called and it's more than just a you know more than just being convicted because you know you're wrong but something in here says I feel the pull amen I've heard the voice of God hallelujah if you've heard that voice if something in here says that's me amen amen you're worthy hallelujah amen you Lord Jacob was a supplanter his his very name resembled his nature he was a Shyer as the prophecy is a supplanter there's no good thing in him but yet he wanted that Birthright amen and there's no good thing in you or I it doesn't matter I don't care if you could trace your you I don't care if I could trace my lineage back to Adam or back to the upper room or my great great great granddaddy was in the upper room that means nothing doesn't matter if i' I I've lived a perfect life that means nothing doesn't matter if I've lived a terrible life that means nothing there's something in there says yes hallelujah hallelujah amen so we have we have the key to the door amen we have the key to the door we have the right door and we've got faith in that door how do you know you have faith CU it's been revealed to you that you have the faith Hallelujah you know I'm so glad some people just take the scripture and they look for that's just a nice scripture to read amen and they say oh that's such a nice scripture it goes beyond that but when you read it something Anor said that's for me amen that the Bible is becomes a living word hallelujah amen amen so if you have that you have the key remember faith in his finished work why did he why did why did have the send a prophet take over all the Creeds of man to tie by giving you the truth that ties you back into Calvary amen by teaching the commands of doctr mean you make the word of God no effect what was the effect of the word of moses' law to cover their sins by the blood of an animal what is the effect of the Gospel today this message to annihilate sin to give you a new nature amen that the blood the life that was released on the cross that day would come into you amen amen hallelujah amen amen so so here's a few doors we have the key to amen we have the key to the door of healing and the church said amen amen we have the key to the door of of Peace as I read we have the key to the door of Joy amen we have the key to the door of of longsuffering amen hallelujah we have the key to the door of his divine nature that's right we have the key to the door of the power of God Amen we have the key to the door of the Rapture am amen we have that key amen how am I going to get there I believe what he did hallelujah it's been revealed to me that he died for me Hallelujah we have the key to the door of our family salvation hallelujah amen amen we have the key to the door of all things amen amen all things in Christ we have access to Thank You Lord amen we have it you have it in your hand I say you have it in your heart rather you can't lose this key amen amen you can't lose the key of Faith that's right if it's been revealed to you you can't lose it amen I feel so happy one day and down the next day don't go by how you feel go by what's been revealed to you and that's why now this why God PS it in he is so determined he wants you to know that he is your savior and that's why he makes you understand how I'm lost and then he redeems you then he saves you cuz he wants to reveal that to you and then he lets you get sick and then he heals you amen and then he let you get into some financial trouble Amen to let him know that you he is your provider Hallelujah and then you get all stressed and red because he wants he allows that to happen that that that you'll receive his peace amen hallelujah hallelujah amen and it's and if he's done that for you now he does that for a reason because he wants to you to show you I'm the door I have all these promises that I want to release to you amen amen and so he does those things that in the time of trouble amen you can draw from those experiences and you can put the key of faith in the door and receive what you need amen amen that's why oh if he healed me once he heal me again if he saved me he can save anybody amen amen if he could be the peace in the storm he can still be the peace in the storm amen if I don't know my direction he led my direction then he'll do it today I I don't know which way to turn he'll direct my steps amen amen and that's why he does it to you cuz he wants you to rest upon the fact if he's done that for you there he's going to do it for you now you Lord amen he hasn't brought us thus far to just to lose us amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen he is the key to the door thank you Lord faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that faith in his finished work it's these keys that we're speaking on I just wanted to read that again amen so don't be afraid to use the keys amen well I tried it once and it didn't work who my brother Isaac likes fishing who else likes fishing there we go just because you don't catch a fish doesn't mean you go fishing doesn't mean you just quit fishing do you that's right amen you go again I'm still sick maybe he wants to teach you something else amen maybe he wants to reveal something else oh things are just real shaky maybe he wants to teach you something else amen because he remember we have great exceeding precious promises but if you don't search into those promises how do you know you have them and normally it's it's when you need them when you need something that's when you go look for it amen that is right that's right so unless you actually you know that's why that's why I think Peter even said it um I might be wrong he said rejoice when you're under when great trials and things come upon you he he says count it all joy how can I count this all joy you should count it all joy because he's trying to he wants to reveal something in that trial amen that that you will know there's a door amen you can open what you need of what you have need of are you following me y amen amen we have everything at our fingertips that's right amen we don't have to beg for it we don't have to earn it in any way it's just been given to us amen it's been given through this word amen hallelujah he is the door amen amen he says here's the door to the Sheep let's read this let's go to John chapter 10 let's read this here John chapter 10 we'll read from verse one I'll

he's doing that to show when you don't know which way to go say Lord which way should I go and sometimes someone just comes and talks you talk about something other there it is and there you go amen sometimes you just says here here go this way amen but you got to open the door that's right amen turn the KE ke you have the you have the key amen we're called to believe all things are possible in this day amen and okay is a Rapture greater than a healing in God's sight amen he doesn't to me now now this is all me we think of things as the greater the effort the greater the thing oh look I built a house oh that's a great thing oh I just opened the door that's not such a great thing but the god it's all the same that's right amen so if he can if he can do all things are just the same for him cuz it Doesn't expend his energy it doesn't use up his power in any way amen so he shouldn't be afraid well I don't know if I have that key you have the key amen if you have if if he has revealed himself to you that's right amen if he has Upon This Rock the revelation of who he is now I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not provide against it so if he has if he has revealed

open every door amen who's ever seen a Rapture before no one go hunt it down amen it it's in the arcade amen all you need is a step ladder of Faith to go and reach it off the top top top shelf amen amen and you already have the step ladder of Faith why did David look at David's life he killed the lion he killed the bear that was that was God was building his faith that whenever he came to another crisis he'd go back to those testimonies and say God if you delivered me from the poor the what did he say to Saul what did he say he said God delivered into my hand the life of The Lion and the bear and if he delivered them into my hand this uncircumcised Philistine will be the same as them that's right amen if he healed you of a co cold he can heal you of a cancer amen amen if he saved you he can save your family amen amen all those things were were were just just God was dealing in his life to when the big challenges came what was the big challenges on the run from Saul in the great hours of distress he could he could when his whole when his family and his men's family were taken by you know the ones that burnt the city zigg took them away he could say if God helped me when I was a boy Shepherd he'll sure help me now amen amen he just had that key of faith and he put it on the door amen all my family's been taken by the enemy he just used that key of faith and he put it in the door everyone all of my men are consenting to Stone me go read the scripture that's what it says he just put us the key of faith and opened the door well how did he do it then he just delighted himself in the Lord amen he delighted himself in the Lord and that's how that way he didn't try and work it out he just delighted himself in the Lord I don't know how this is going to work out just delight yourself in the Lord amen that's right amen amen amen that that that that's what he did he didn't try and work it out even though he would have had the intelligence to to to work it out he just delighted himself in the Lord amen everything's falling apart Delight himself delight yourself in the Lord what's easy for me to say just delight yourself in the Lord amen that's all you need to do and that's how he overcame that's how he overcame because he knew that that was a source of strength amen and the devil the devil all he tries to do is take you away from your source of strength what is your source of strength faith in his finished work on Calvary amen so do not let anything in here take you from your source of strength amen amen because if the devil could get you to forget

you now you haven't you keep pulling it back amen you have to give it over oh but I can do it no you can't amen the more you realize you can't do it the more God can work amen Jesus is the door am we have access to every promise in the word every promise in the word from healing to a body changing and everything in between we have access to it we have the access to the power of God we have access to be seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we have access that heaven comes down wherever we are amen we have access that we can live in another dimension the world knows nothing about amen

people they say like a genius they can they can tap into things in their minds that other people have no way of doing amen they all have brains that look like our brains well what makes them so intelligent they have they have an intelligence that other men can't tap into but yet you know some you know they say that man only uses not you know man doesn't use 100% of his brain that's right amen but other people can seem to tap into things and make themselves well they just are born as a genius because they tap into things amen we're not called to tap into 1% of God Amen we're called to tap into 100% of God amen amen I'll just leave you with this question how how much of him do you want amen amen well I've been walking this way many years how much of him do you want amen Enoch walked with God and he was not Hallelujah and that is our type he walked with him glory how does someone how do you get to know someone in a manner of speaking you walk with them you spend time with them they speak to you you speak to them amen and that was Enoch Enoch's great thing was he walked with God wherever God would take him he just walked with God Amen and that's the great big secret as well just walk with him and every and well well brother Tim DoD said it at Camp he said when his first wife died and and he was in the middle of that trial he said I'm going to look around because I May Never Walk This Way Again amen and to me it's like if you go and and and and I and this came to my was up at brother Freddy's it's like if you just say went to some big Museum there's a big difference in the tour if if one of their um art directors took you on the tour and pointed out all the paintings and said this is who painted this this is what it's about and this is how old it is and all these things and they can point out all the pieces of art but then if you just went in there by yourself with no idea you maybe say that was neat that wasn't neat I didn't like that then you'd walk out but you wouldn't get the full impact of the tour of the building amen it's the same thing in a trial if you don't look around and see now why is this happening what yo what's going on over here if you don't sit and look around you won't get the full impact of what God is trying to teach you in the trial amen that's why when things are good look around Lord what are you trying to teach me when things are good because he doesn't just try and teach you things when things are bad and then when things are bad definitely look around amen not just not just in here but look around here see what's going on why situation like this Lord what are you trying to teach me through this that you know that happened other day look around amen and he'll show you what's going on and that's important because as I said if you don't do that if you just kind of oh I hope this gets better and you walk along you won't receive what he's fully trying to get you to see amen it's the same thing that's why I you must open every door amen every Divine promise we have the key of Faith amen amen don't be afraid to open the door and get what you need amen maybe I just leave it there that's what we're called
