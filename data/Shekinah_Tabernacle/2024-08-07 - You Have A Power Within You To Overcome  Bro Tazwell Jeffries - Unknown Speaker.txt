========================================

[Music] good evening good evening men of God and woman of God I always enjoyed brother Alpha you know whenever You' see him he would always say man of God and he shake my hand did he do that to you or was it just me what about did he ever does he ever call anyone woman of God any of the sisters does he ever say that no not that he has to I'm just wondering but uh you know there's power in confession because Satan's always trying to tell you that you're not you know and it's powerful when you tell someone that they are like woman of God woman of God you know we and when you realize then you think yeah I actually am a woman of God I am a man of God and you you know you you um act differently when you when you know that you are and when you believe you know but Satan's always trying to

verse 12 and then if you could hold Ephesians uh chapter 1 as well uh verse 12 say says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name and then the book of Ephesians I I I love the book of Ephesians um chapter 1 and you'll just read from verse three it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ we are blessed people according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame

God bless you good to you sister Hannah alatan God bless you good to see you um yes um I've got I've got a title this evening but I was I was just thinking um today um so generally I come once a quarter to Wellington um and we have customer meetings and it's just like meetings that runs whole day and you sit there and you get so bored and you get so tired and I wasn't looking forward to the meetings of the day but I was looking forward to the meeting of tonight you know it's just so wonderful to gather together with a people that loves the Lord Jesus and uh you know just we have that that kindred spirit amongst us it's it's so good this this evening when I just stepped in and I as I walked in I just looked and I seen the brother at the back the Deacon and I just I just I can't explain how I felt brother the goodin but it's just wonderful wonderful to be here um not really sure exactly how things are going to go this evening but we just trust the Lord um so i' I've got a title just a thought um and I'm not sure if I'm going to hit the thought but uh it's just something that the Lord has been dealing with me for a while um and uh I'm going to the title says you have a power within you to overcome amen simple simple thought you have a power within you to overcome and the inspiration behind it and I I've got it written out it says here Lord Jesus please give us Revelation to know this amen because you know how it is many times we we we we we hear these powerful words um you know the min would come and they would give us these these these words that that really does something to us but many times you know I believe that God has got to come and give us that that divine revelation because once we we we we catch the revelation of what God is trying to tell us then I believe it automatically has an impact on how we live that's right um it has an impact on how we make decisions amen you know the word revelation it's about um you know if you go if you just go and and go and read the church change book um brother brandham would say you know the word revelation the Greek word is apocalypse but he would say the mean the the the meaning behind the word revelation is to un Veil something yeah that's previously been hidden so it is it's it's something that's always been there yeah but it takes what they say Revelation to come and maybe it's a maybe it's a sheet that's covering it Revelation is taking that sheet pulling it away way and revealing what's there amen and I believe that is what our Lord Jesus Christ constantly wants to do in our lives and he is doing it amen in our lives I was I was um spending some time with a friend uh just a couple of days ago and we were just going he's not a message believer he doesn't believe in William brandham and he he he believes in the Trinity he believes in three gods in one and all these sorts of things but the Lord allowed me just to sit with him and you know just talk about the scriptures and see how this one scripture links in with that scripture and uh you and as I'm talking to him and you know he's starting to see things and it's like lights is going on you know in his head kind of thing as I'm talking to him I'm saying Lord I am so thankful that father you came my way amen amen and you took scriptures Lord that's always been there right yeah hallu and what you did for me you opened up my understanding so that I could sit with this brother and we took we just took Malachi 4 and we took behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children yes and the hearts of the children to the the fathers and the Lord allowed us just to go into the scriptures and and we could see how Malachi 4 he agreed with me you know what actually yes it does talk about sending an Elijah and that Elijah is John the Baptist and then and then you know we could talk about how it talks how Behold our send you Elijah the prophet he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and I told him I said if you look at it and and I said when when when when that scripture became fulfilled I said God pressed pause because there's another part of the scripture that still needed to be fulfilled but I could take him by Revelation to just the first part of John the Baptist and take him into the Book of Luke and point out that you know how the Scriptures it just balances out amen amen but it takes I believe revelation from God to reveal these precious mystery truths to us hallelujah right and I believe that we need to be willing and open to the Holy Ghost open to him Amen to reveal himself to us hallelujah because the more he reveals himself to us yeah and the more we see the Lord Jesus Christ in the word the more we see who we are in the word because remember you are the words in this book that's right I believe so brother Brandon would come and say the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized what that means is revelation is so important Hallelujah that it doesn't matter if Brother TZ comes here on Wednesday and tells you Revelation is important and then by Ben comes on Sunday and says Revelation is important and brother the Aran comes the next Wednesday and says Revelation is important doesn't matter how many times you know we we are told that but the brandom says it cannot be overemphasized Revelation means more to you and me than what we realize because like I said with Revelation it's it's it's showing us things that's always been there amen praise the Lord maybe we just didn't see it at the time and because we didn't see it at the time our lives that we lived lived according to what we had seen yeah true true but then when God comes and he Tak takes the things of our eyes Hallelujah and he shows us more of what is in the word automatically Our Lives has got to adjust to what he is revealing to us hallelujah right so you know the common the common scripture in the Bible which is in Matthew chapter 16 where Jesus comes and he asks his disciples you know who do people say I am Etc and they say some say you are this and some say you are that but then Jesus comes with that question and says but who do you say I am amen and you know what that question has to come to each of us individually amen amen as we sit here if it hasn't come to you yet it will come to you because you need to know who he is amen so the question is who do you say I am and then Peter comes and Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of of the Living God and we know when we look into the scripture today we can recognize that something Supernatural happened to Peter right so that Peter could come with that answer and then Jesus when Peter tells him and says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said unto him Simon you are blessed see de blessed art thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and you know as I'm looking at you you know what I'm talking about because you've experienced the beauty of Revelation because if you didn't experience the beauty of Revelation then you know the your faces would show different but as I'm looking at you I can see that you know what I'm talking about because this is a reality hallelujah it's life changing in the Lord you know what when when when when when Peter said Thou Art the Christ um Jesus turned around to him and says you are blessed Peter Simon you are blessed but then Verse 18 He says and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter now we know Peter was up and down and in and out in these things right but what are so interesting was that when Peter identified by Revelation who Jesus was Jesus then turned to him and said you are Peter now we know that Peter had their change had to come to Peter at some point Hallelujah but what was so beautiful was that Jesus they could tell Peter who he was and then he goes on you know and and we know these things and and Jesus would say and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen and that rock we know is the rock of Revelation brother Brandon would say he says the church is not built upon Jesus he says but it was the revelation of who he is and with Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail amen can we put up that photo you got it uh brother uh now Satan hates revelation but you and I we love it we want it we say Lord give me Revelation and the more he Reveals His word the more brother AR I want the more he reveals the more I want amen hallelujah you know what I'm discing in in my own personal walk is that the more I am seeing who my God is and the more I am seeing who I am in the word it makes me want to surrender more and more and more of myself to him amen amen the more he reveals with and he starts to show me the things that he's showing me in the scriptures the more I want to just give my life I've given myself to him but I want to give the I just want to give more and more and more of myself to him you see Satan hates Revelation but you and I we love it we want it because Revelation shows you who you are now the devil doesn't want you to know who you are but Revelation comes and reveals to you who you are amen Lord because when the you see the devil knows that when you come to that Revelation and the realization of who you are and I'm just I'm leaving that picture there for a while so you can look at it and you can see yourself in it you see the devil knows that when you come to that recognition he is defeated amen you see brother brandham says Satan hates Revelation you see the Bible this word of God exposes Satan yes so the more we the the word is revealed to us and the more we see God for who he is and the more we see us for who we are we also see the devil for who he is and many times people get afraid of the enemy but you and he's a powerful enemy but the more God Reveals His word we come to a realization that the devil is under our feet amen amen amen yes and that's not just words that's a loving reality amall you see Revelation exposes Satan it Reveals His works and it says the The Works of the of Satan is the attempted destruction of the people of God and trying to make the word of God to no effect yeah to try and tell you that you know what the word of God is not as powerful as people say it is or as the minister says it is so he will the devil will come and he wants to break us down he tried it with brother brandham he didn't come and tell brother brandham that God doesn't exist he tried to tell William brandham that God doesn't care so the devil wants to discredit the word he wants to discredit God but Revelation shows that to us amen so we are able to withand him amen because you see I'm going to read the quote he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is you not just Shak of Tabernacle yeah in this Upper Room yeah but there is something great within you there is some transforming power that's within you and the devil doesn't want you to catch that Revelation because this year it's a revelation he says he knows that to the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army and that is who you are don't let any situation and situations is trying to tell you that you are weak that you are nothing that there is no hope for you don't allow that you have the authority to speak to the devil amen and to tell him to go am ammen I I'm not sure if I gave this testimony I'm going to give it and then we'll go on one one you know there was the devil was to menting me one time for a while and it was just getting to me and uh I I I remember I was in my car and I was driving and I was just getting tired of of just giving in every time the enemy come came my way and I was in the car and I was driving and I was praying and I said Lord I am tired I am tired of fighting that thing it's just getting me down every time and as I'm driving in my car I felt the atmosphere change in my car and I'm praying and I'm praying and then all of a sudden I just found myself just uttering words it was like brother arand is like I was sitting in the passenger seat and I was watching Taz driving his car and I was watching Taz speak stuff yeah that he wasn't planning to speak it was like some I can't explain it it was like just words that came out but it was direct to a specific devil that had been tormenting me but it came out in such Authority huj and then when that was done that's like I I came to myself and and uh I I I was so weak and I I turned around I was close to home I turned around I got home and my wife seen as I came out of the car I was half staggering and she came and said T are you okay what what's wrong and I said wait wait wait wait I'll tell you later but the beauty of it all is that that specific devil never bothered me again until today amen so there is an authority hallelujah amen within you he just wants us to surrender amen surrender everything amen surrender my wants surrender my desires says give it all to Jesus amen and you will see what he does in your life and my life and we know again you know what I'm talking about you going through the same things I'm going through you experiencing the same God that I'm experiencing and you know what I don't ever want to go back to where I came from amen I am grateful for what I have and as I'm reading the word it's showing me what I can attain so I I got this picture and I actually wrote in there I said the word seed in you is Unstoppable you see God has placed a part of himself within you and that part of himself if we go read the scripture if we're going do the message of brother Bram you talk about the gene seed of God you talk about the gene of God you talk about the seed that's what you and I have within us that's right and if we look at this photo this picture it proves the power that is in a natural seat this is a normal flow look at it if I go and I go and pluck it off or plck of that yellow flow I can take it and I can easily just crush it I can go and I can put my foot over it and I can just break that flower but what that flower is proving or this picture is proving that deep down somewhere there is a power Hallelujah brother brandham would talk about transforming power Lord if we look at the natural seed that natural seed has got a power of transformation when it was in the ground it was just a little seed that was laying there and then life came along and started to throw things over the seed trying to stifle its growth trying to keep it down there but that seed maybe didn't realize it but the seed just surrendered itself to the life that existed in the seed amen right and regardless of the concrete regardless of the stuff that happened that se proved that it had something within itself Hall that would be able to press through concrete that I think this is called concrete or tar or whatever that we have to go take a hammer or a axe or whatever to make a hole we've got to go and we've got to hit it and we got to hit it a couple of times in order to make a hole the seed proved regardless of what's at the bottom Hallelujah there's an authority there's a power of transformation and that seed would push through the obstacles Hallelujah but allowing the life that's in that seed to do the work until it has transformed into this beautiful flower but that seed the transformation doesn't stop there because the transformation goes on cuz that flower depending on what it is has the potential to become a big tree so there is a potential within the seed natural seed and we see it here now take the natural seed and look at yourself Our God has placed within you his seed and that makes you unable amen regardless of what you might face in life that's right the seed within you and that seed might be laying dormant for a while but when the light of the word comes your way and that light strikes that seed and Revelation eats you it changes your life a good classical example is the woman at the well but the brandom would talk about her he to love to talk about the woman at the well the Bible says in John chapter 4 where Jesus says I have needs to go through Samaria so we know Jesus and his disciples they were somewhere and they were going to go or whatever but Jesus just felt this pool I have needs to go via Samaria because there was somebody that needed to have that seed that was in her brother David to have that seed ignited she was a woman the Bible would would say of ill Fame and we know these things right she was a woman that people would see as a bad woman doing bad things but you know what I love about God and I see it through the ministry of brother Brandon is that he would look at that woman and you would see her as a bad woman she was a bad woman doing bad things but the grace of God and and and the love of God would look at that thing from a different perspective you know what I believe that's what Revelation does to us as well the more he reveals himself and the more he reveals the word when we look at things and when we look at people and and maybe this person is not in the right space that they need to be in because God has revealed more and more of himself to us amen our approach and our attitude to that person is different my Lord so brother Brandon would say for about this this lady he says maybe her parents did not care and maybe she made bad choices in life and that's why she ended up where she was doing the things that she was doing not knowing that deep James deep down inside of her was something sacred was something special she would maybe walk down the street and the neighbors and the people would turn up their nose maybe they might gossip about her or send messages to the next house and say hey close your windows she's coming past to the world she was a fthy woman but Jesus had need to go via Samaria because this fthy woman needed a change in her life life amen this fthy woman needed an experience that to show her who she truly was so obviously she probably didn't know she had that potential within her but she probably also knew that there was something different about her yeah she maybe couldn't put a finger on it because if you listen to the conversation that she and Jesus had it was about worship this ill failed ill famed woman doing the bad things that she does she had a conversation with Jesus about worship but what she didn't know that she as she was coming thinking is just another day to come and fetch water not knowing that that was her day on the calendar of God you see God wanted her to be at the right place at the right time in the right season for her because there was somebody amen that had needs Lord to go via Samaria she was walking towards that well having no idea that her life was going to change you know what I identify with that in my own testimony I went to church that day I had no idea that my life was going to change and I know your testimonies here today you had no idea that your life was going to be changed but he came your way he had needs Hallelujah to go VI wherever he met you yeah forz it was in a valley in South Africa in Kimberly he had needs to go via Kimberly for T amen and you have your own testimony right when he came your way brother bandam says watch what was it talking about when Jesus was talking to this woman he says that light struck that seed that was in her she had no idea it was there but it was there because you see that seed then drives you to want to know more because that seed knows that this word is powerful that seed knows that there is power in what we read so brother Bram says the seed talking about the woman it had been laying there that was spoke by God and then when the Holy Holy Spirit in him moved away her past life and showed it to her showed her PA that light brother Bram says struck the seed yeah that was laying within her she had no idea that it was there but it was there and when that light stuck struck that seed she became unstable prise Lord cuz what did she do she went running running and says come and see a man that told me certain things but she did not realize it was more than the man just telling her things something happened within her and her life was transformed in the patriarch um Abraham brother Bram says all Abraham seed believes God am they are believing God we believe God I believe I'm speaking to Abraham's spiritual seed today amen he says and we know that it pleased God so well that here is what he said thy seed shall possess the gates of its enemy thy seed shall possess amen the gates of its enemy that is scripture and scripture does not lie no no what scripture says it will do it will do amen yes sir and I got I got some so I'm not going to go to it you can Genesis 22:17 Genesis 2460 Numbers 14:24 Deuteronomy 18 all referring to thy Sheed shall possess the Gate of its enemy am am that's your promise Hallelujah so don't let the devil M you around amen come on now amen you tell him I know who I amallah and if you're sitting here today right and you're struggling with who you are you don't have the Revelation don't allow yourself to be under pressure yeah because someone caught a revelation of something and maybe you didn't catch that revelation that doesn't make you any less than that person I'm saying that because I've been through that sitting with brothers and man the Deep Revelations and you sit there and you feel so insecure and feel like you know nothing God will in his time he will reveal to you what you need to know amen so don't allow yourself to be put under pressure no don't but just remember this that there is something great within you there's a seed of God that's Unstoppable amen I said you have a power within you to overcome am and my inspiration was Lord help us to catch the Revelation amen of these things because when you come to that realization that there is a a an authority within you nothing can stand in your way nothing now I know it's easy to say that but that's the reality amen we might think I think brother the Brandon there's a quot quote somebody gave a yeah I think Andrew G posted a quote and I I I screenshot it I want to just read it here quickly it says brother brand brother brandom actually says he says in the in this great warrior David he says we still got goliaths so there's still goliaths out there we know the story of David and Goliath right there's still goliaths out there and those goliaths are trying to threaten us and those goliaths are trying to still mock us they still trying to tell us that we are we are big you small you nothing come on but brother Bram says we still got goliaths amen he says and we still got David's too I see The Davids here tonight amen all goliaths out there that's right but there are Davids here as wellah and what did David do he followed the instructions of God he prophesied he didn't have a sword but he says I'm going to cut off your neck that's right and he did that so yeah David's here today this is my last quote and then we'll finish the musicians can come possessing the enemy's Gates brother Bram says this and today the Church of the Living God has the privilege of standing and seeing the Conquering resurrected Jesus Christ the son of the Living God standing present living in his church he's living with inside of you you know that right when you go home he's within you when you go to bed at night he's not only around you but he's in you living in his church doing the same thing he did there then yeah then we possess the Gate of every enemy yeah we possess it not the past possesses it on your behalf not the Deacon on your behalf but you amen doesn't matter how young you are on doesn't matter how old you might think you are you can possess that's right amen amen the Gate of every [Music] enemy if you if you are a Seed of Abraham after hearing this there's not enough devils in hell can keep that Gat before you amen now sometimes we find ourselves trapped behind some gates oh my Lord sometimes it's a bad situation and we find ourselves trapped behind that gate Lord and that gate is trying to prevent us from moving forward yeah because that's what we need to do as Christians we move forward amen amen Onward Christian Soldiers Hallelujah so brother brandom says there's this gate that stands before you he says there's not enough devils in hell that can keep that gate before you Hallelujah now we as we sit here can place whatever the gate is that's trying to keep us down keep us bound I wrote here maybe it's a gate trying to tell you that you cannot receive the Holy Ghost cuz the devil does want to try to do that but you see you have an authority to possess the Gate of the enemy Hallelujah brother Bram says that gate it has got to open yes sir he says I don't care what it is yes sir Hallelujah now if brother brandom says I don't care what it is then you must not care what it is amen because that gate can be broken down oh yesah believe Lord remember House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Amen it might be a gate telling you you a weak Christian might be a gate telling you you just naturally just weak trying to tell you that you are nothing you have an authority over that gate you know what I I love as well right is that maybe we we caught in this gate uh maybe I don't know what it is lust you know all these sorts of things that just keeps us there and then we think because you know I'm caught up in this I don't have an authority to overcome it I don't have I'm not able to really break through this gate you know Jesus comes he tells us about the prodical son oh yes where did the prodical son come to himself he was in the pig pin yes right yeah that's why amongst the pigs but he had to come to a realization I'm not a pig I don't belong in the pig pen but he was still that that piggish gate was still there but he came to the realization even behind the gate he came to a realization amen hallelujah I'm know who I am and my father is waiting for me I'm not just anything I'm I'm his son and that prodal son then had the ability to break P that gate that biggish gate come on Hallelujah but before he broke through the realization hit him yes yes sir so my encouragement to you as we close and the musicians you came come now brother brandham says there's not enough devils in hell that can keep that gate before you Hallelujah it will open I don't care what it is and then he goes on and he says this he says you walk up there as a promised seed Seed of Abraham hallu that's who you are Hallelujah there's an authority within you you are able to break whatever gate tries to keep you down but the brandom says you walk up there as a promise seat yeah and you say I claim this for mine amen amen now you could come up and you could have brother the T pray with you and I would love to do that the ministers would love to pray with each other we love that we support each other amen but brother brandham says yes says you have an authority right you walk up there as a promise seed and you say I claim this for mine am amen this is mine because God swore that he'd raise up Jesus and through Jesus I conquered says that's what you say and he says you go on he says and you say this I come in the name of that conqueror amen Jesus Christ amen you have that Authority am just put it into practice amen you know as as you're looking at me your faces beautiful faces it differs each of us look different and we each have our different challenges in life but you have an authority over that challenge over that Goliath amen and and you know what hallelu we you pray for something and it seems like nothing is happening but there are things happening I'm I mention it I'm not mention it again yet because it sort of fits in with the context my my wife was sick one time and she was um she she she was terribly sick and she went into a prayer line in in in December and she felt the hand of the Lord touch her she was supposed to go for surgery or major operation the Lord touched her in December it took from December until September the next year for the manifestation of the healing to happen but God started the work so it doesn't matter how long you think you might be praying for something things are happening am my God is coming through for you amen so you walk up and you say I claim this for mine this is mine because God swore that he'd raise up Jesus and through Jesus I conquer it I come in the name of that conqueror Jesus Christ Satan or situation or problem step back amen so gate whatever it is for the prodal son it was a piggish gate but he caught the revelation of who he was and that piggish gate had got to go so he could go through and you have that Authority uh tell that gate step back I'm passing through the Bram reads that the scripture again he shall possess the Gate of the enemy brother Brandon says then stand up there with your soldiers back your Shield shining covered by the blood of Jesus the enemy will recognize it and that Gat whatever it is has got to come down the seed had Gates of concrete and whatever it was but it proved the power in the seed amen and that power is within you as we just bow our heads and we close our [Music] eyes Lord Jesus we so thankful tonight that it's your grace and it's your mercy Lord that we can speak these powerful Revelations Lord God this is so wonderful Lord just to know that the scripture said thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy Hallelujah and know God I believe this evening you just wanted me my God lord just to release that to us your people father amen so that when we go out and we do the things that we do my God by Revelation you are showing us who we are and loving father by revelation we can say that as a Seed of Abraham am I'm able to possess the gate that's trying to slow me [Music] down I I pray this evening loving father that we we touched earlier at the beginning of the service we touched on the importance of Revelation Lord and I just pray this evening that my God if you are people here that desires more Revelation the desires my God a deeper understanding of your word that loving father you would honor their requests because Lord God it is an honorable request for Revelation Lord give us more Revelation so that Lord God when when when these Gates come before us Lord God we can know what we are [Music] saying because it's by Revelation oh God that Lord God we are able to do the things that we do because loving father you Revelation you come and you show us that there is a power within us Lord that there's an authority over hell father in fact brother the Brandon tells us he says that the life that we live Sanctified holy it's the Thunder that shakes hell Lord the life that we live surrendered to you is
