[40:05] praise the lord um
[40:08] you could turn with me to uh romans
[40:10] chapter eight
[40:18] and um
[40:22] actually let's go to first john chapter
[40:24] two
[40:26] and then we'll go to romans chapter
[40:27] eight
[40:36] so first john chapter 2 and read verses
[40:38] 20 down to 29
[40:41] and um we did read this last sunday but
[40:43] i want to kind of take it in another
[40:44] direction
[40:46] uh today
[40:49] it says
[40:50] but you have an ancient from the holy
[40:52] one and you know all things
[40:54] i have not written unto you because you
[40:55] know not the truth but because you know
[40:57] it
[40:58] and that no lie is of the truth who is a
[41:02] lie but he that denieth that jesus is
[41:03] the christ he is antichrist that denieth
[41:06] the father and the son who so whosoever
[41:09] denieth the son the same hath not the
[41:11] father but he that acknowledges the son
[41:13] has the father also
[41:15] let that therefore abide in you which
[41:16] you have heard from the beginning
[41:18] if that
[41:19] if that which you have heard from the
[41:21] beginning shall remain in you
[41:23] you also shall continue in the son and
[41:26] the father this is the promise that he
[41:27] has promised us even eternal life
[41:29] these things have i written unto you
[41:31] concerning them that seduce you but the
[41:33] anointing which you have received of him
[41:36] abideth in you and you need not that any
[41:38] man teach you but as the same anointing
[41:40] teaches teacheth you of all things and
[41:43] his truth and is no lie and even as it
[41:46] hath taught you you shall abide in him
[41:48] and now little children abide in him
[41:52] that when he shall appear you may have
[41:54] confidence
[41:56] and
[41:56] and not be ashamed before him it is
[41:59] coming if you know that he is righteous
[42:01] you know that everyone that doeth
[42:03] righteousness is born of him
[42:06] and let's go to romans chapter 8
[42:14] and i'm sure it's a very familiar piece
[42:16] of scripture to to us all but uh we'll
[42:19] just start from verse six
[42:26] it says this here
[42:28] for to be carnally minded as death but
[42:30] to be spiritually minded is life and
[42:33] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[42:36] against god for it is not subject to the
[42:38] law of god neither indeed can be
[42:41] so then they that are in the flesh
[42:43] cannot find
[42:45] so they that are in the flesh cannot
[42:47] please god
[42:48] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[42:50] spirit
[42:51] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[42:53] you now if any man have not the spirit
[42:55] of christ he is none of his and if
[42:57] christ begin you the body is dead
[42:59] because of sin but the spirit is life
[43:02] because of righteousness but if the
[43:03] spirit of him that raised up jesus from
[43:05] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[43:07] christ from the dead shall also quicken
[43:09] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[43:11] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[43:14] are deaders not of the flesh to live
[43:16] after the flesh for if you live after
[43:18] the flesh you shall die but if you live
[43:19] through the spirit
[43:21] but if you if ye through the spirit do
[43:23] mortify the deeds of the body you shall
[43:25] live for as many and this is read the
[43:27] verse one to get to for as many
[43:29] as are led by the spirit of god they are
[43:31] the sons of god
[43:33] for ye have not received the spirit of
[43:35] bondage again to fear but ye have
[43:37] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[43:40] you cry abba father the spirit itself
[43:43] witness without spirit that we are the
[43:45] children of god and if children then
[43:47] heirs ears of god and joint heirs with
[43:49] christ if so be that we suffer with him
[43:52] we may be also glorified together for i
[43:55] reckon that the sufferings of this
[43:57] present time are not worthy to be
[43:59] compared with the glory which shall be
[44:01] revealed in us
[44:03] i mean let's just bow our heads together
[44:05] word of prayer
[44:06] gracious heavenly father we like to
[44:08] thank you lord for your word thank you
[44:10] it is a living word father that you are
[44:12] not a stagnant god of history but you're

[44:19] you're alive lord that the tomb is empty
[44:21] and lord it's more lord we know you've

[44:41] yourself through your word to us oh god
[44:43] and father may just anoint speaker and
[44:45] hearer one more time
[44:47] father we could leave this place changed
[44:48] law because of your transforming power
[44:51] father may you grant that lord and
[44:52] father we want to pray for brother andy

[45:08] father we pray these things lord have
[45:09] your way among us oh god in jesus
[45:11] christ's name amen
[45:13] amen you may be seated
[45:18] now
[45:20] i'd like to i'd like to try and approach
[45:22] the subject and i i don't think i'll be
[45:24] able to uh
[45:25] could you just turn this down a bit um
[45:28] i want to i want to speak on divine
[45:30] leadership this morning you know i was
[45:33] walking down the stairs at work i think
[45:34] it was a thursday or wednesday and just
[45:36] those two words dropped into my heart
[45:37] divine leadership
[45:40] and it's very it's you know it's a vital
[45:42] subject because
[45:44] you know we are led by either two things
[45:47] and the scripture itself
[45:49] is a record of two leaderships
[45:52] it's it's the record of god's divine
[45:55] leadership
[45:56] and it's also the record of satan's
[45:58] religious leadership there's only two
[46:02] and i'm going to show that to you soon
[46:03] so we must be everyone is led by
[46:05] something
[46:08] now in the message leadership in 65
[46:12] he says now remember this is brother
[46:13] brown speaking each one of us young and
[46:16] old
[46:16] your first step that you ever made in
[46:18] your life someone had to lead you
[46:21] that's right and your last step you ever
[46:23] make someone will be leading you
[46:26] someone has to lead god has likened us
[46:29] unto sheep
[46:30] and if
[46:31] anyone knows about raising sheep and the
[46:33] nature of sheep while you know that a
[46:35] sheep cannot find its way around he has
[46:38] to be led
[46:40] and then the same same message he says
[46:42] now there's something in nature watch
[46:44] the birds watch the animals watch
[46:46] everything and you watch nature
[46:48] watch the little dove how he flies what
[46:50] a different bird he is see he doesn't
[46:52] have any gall
[46:54] he can't eat like the crow can see he
[46:56] has no gall in him he doesn't have to
[46:58] take a bath in the water because he's
[47:01] got something on the inside of him it
[47:03] cleans him out from the inside out you
[47:05] see and that's the way the christian is
[47:07] that's the way god represented himself
[47:09] in a dove
[47:11] because jesus was represented as a lamb
[47:13] always in nature you'll find god and god
[47:16] likened us unto sheep that has to be led
[47:19] did you ever notice there he says the
[47:21] lamb coming down on the dove to lead the
[47:24] lamb
[47:25] it and it led him to the slaughter so
[47:27] when jesus was baptized john said behold
[47:29] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[47:30] of the world and john saw the spirit of
[47:32] god like a dove descend upon him so
[47:34] those two natures came together
[47:38] if the lamb the dove could not have
[47:40] descended upon any other type of animal
[47:42] because they both had to have the same
[47:44] nature see if the dove would have lit
[47:46] upon a wolf it would have snorted or
[47:49] growled the what the dove would have
[47:51] taken its flight
[47:52] well it's the same way now and our ill
[47:54] ways the holy spirit just takes this
[47:56] flight and goes away
[47:58] it's got to have the same nature the
[48:00] birds of heavens the dove the meekest
[48:02] animal on earth the lamb they can agree
[48:04] together
[48:05] and when the holy spirit comes upon us
[48:07] and makes us new creatures then he can
[48:09] lead us
[48:11] but we try to live the same old life it
[48:14] won't work it just won't work now the
[48:16] first step you've probably ever taken in
[48:18] your life speaking of leadership
[48:20] it was probably the hands
[48:22] of some kind of mother them hands may be
[48:24] still tonight out there in some cemetery
[48:27] somewhere but that was the hand that led
[48:29] you to make your first step then after
[48:32] mother taught you how to walk and you
[48:34] would make a few steps and fall down and
[48:36] get up and you thought you were doing
[48:38] great things then she turned you over to
[48:40] the school teacher
[48:42] and then she began to lead you to
[48:44] education and how
[48:46] and what you must do and how you must
[48:48] learn and so forth like that then after
[48:51] the school teacher got through with you
[48:52] then you return back your father got a
[48:54] hold of you and then your father got a
[48:57] hold of you he taught you perhaps your
[48:59] business how to be a successful
[49:00] businessman how to do things right your
[49:03] mother taught you to be a housewife how
[49:05] to cook and so forth like that but after
[49:07] they got through with you then your
[49:09] minister or priest got a hold of you but
[49:11] then you asked the question but now who
[49:13] leads you
[49:15] now who leads you there's only two now
[49:17] uh yeah i've been thinking about this
[49:18] because this is this is very vital this
[49:21] is incredibly vital
[49:22] because if you look in the bible as i
[49:24] said there's two leaderships there's
[49:26] god's divine leadership or this satan's
[49:28] religious leadership both were religious
[49:31] both claim to worship god both claim to
[49:33] be the true but only one was divinely
[49:36] led
[49:37] amen i mean it's the same thing today it
[49:38] doesn't change
[49:40] so we need to think about these things
[49:43] so
[49:44] everyone
[49:46] so everyone is led now if this is a bit
[49:48] laborious today i'm just sorry this is
[49:50] just how it came to me everyone is led
[49:52] by something and even though
[49:54] so i'll just list a few
[49:56] because there's god and there's a whole
[49:58] bunch of other things but jesus said
[50:00] very simply in matthew 12 30 he that is
[50:03] not with me is against me
[50:05] and he that gathereth not with me is
[50:07] scattered abroad
[50:09] so it doesn't matter what category you
[50:10] may say what the other campers are
[50:12] leading people jesus said very simply if
[50:14] you're not with me you're against me
[50:16] that's it there's only two there's not
[50:17] three or fifty there's two
[50:20] amen
[50:21] so if you're not with him
[50:23] and how can two walk together unless
[50:24] they'll be agreed
[50:26] amen you can't you can't actually walk
[50:28] with god without agreeing with him
[50:31] and the only way you agree with me say
[50:32] yes i take you your word lord and
[50:34] surrender to it
[50:35] that's the only way you can be with him
[50:38] so in reality man is either led by the
[50:41] holy ghost or he's not
[50:44] now let's look now i'm just going to
[50:45] look a list of a couple of knots
[50:50] people just say just follow your heart
[50:52] who's heard people say that just follow
[50:53] your heart just be true to yourself
[50:55] you know but then in jeremiah
[50:58] jeremiah says in jeremiah 17 verse 9 the
[51:01] heart is deceitful above all things and
[51:04] desperately wicked who could know it
[51:06] i mean so how can people say well i'm
[51:08] just going to follow my heart but but
[51:10] god is saying through jeremiah the heart
[51:11] of man is desperately wicked
[51:14] so i'm not going to trust me i'm not
[51:15] going to trust my feelings
[51:17] i'm not going to trust well i just have
[51:18] a gut feeling to go this way who says
[51:20] the gut feeling's right
[51:22] i mean who you know who says it's right
[51:24] well i feel this way you've got to be
[51:27] careful remember
[51:28] what are you being led by yeah just
[51:31] because you come to church i believe the
[51:32] message what are you being led by
[51:35] because it's an individual affair
[51:36] between you and god
[51:38] ultimately it's him leading you that's
[51:40] right
[51:41] so you've got to you've got to take
[51:42] these things
[51:43] so he says the heart is deceitful above
[51:45] all things
[51:47] and that's because man is born with a
[51:48] fallen nature to begin with
[51:51] yeah
[51:52] so you can't trust your heart well i
[51:54] just need to get no you can't do that
[51:56] and then he says in the next verse he
[51:58] says i the lord search the heart i try
[52:01] the reigns
[52:02] even to give every man according to his
[52:04] ways and according to the fruit of his
[52:06] doings
[52:07] so god actually weighs it up saying well
[52:09] is this right or is this wrong
[52:12] amen because everyone thinks uh you know
[52:14] i read the scripture i think a month ago
[52:16] every man is right in their own eyes
[52:19] that's what the scripture says every man
[52:20] is right in their eyes so every man can
[52:22] justify their position whatever they're
[52:24] doing in life
[52:25] you know and and they and then in their
[52:27] own mind they can say i'm absolutely
[52:29] justified i have a right to do what i'm
[52:30] doing
[52:32] you can't
[52:33] hold on you can't go that way
[52:36] you have to you've got to take it back
[52:38] you've got to take it back to this
[52:40] yes amen you've got to everyone has to
[52:42] have an absolute
[52:44] and if you're absolute is well my heart
[52:46] feels to do this you got the wrong
[52:47] absolute
[52:49] i mean but if you can take it back to
[52:50] something that's solid that's been
[52:52] proven
[52:53] that's been vindicated over and over
[52:55] again
[52:56] amen and not what you think about it
[52:58] what god says about it amen amen
[53:01] and then he also says in in jeremiah 10
[53:05] because man relies on his own ability
[53:08] you know say you see the civilization
[53:10] we're in it is man's achievement this is
[53:12] what we can do yeah you know what could
[53:15] let's build a better one than the next
[53:17] nation you know let's let's let's have
[53:19] our you know our better way of doing
[53:20] things
[53:21] and they put their minds together and
[53:23] they and man has achieved incredible
[53:24] things
[53:26] but jeremiah says in chapter 10 verse 23
[53:31] o lord i know that the way of man is not
[53:33] in himself
[53:34] it is not in man
[53:36] that walketh to direct the steps
[53:39] so jeremiah was saying it's not actually
[53:41] in
[53:43] it's not actually it man
[53:45] you know the way of man is not in
[53:47] himself and that word way is actually
[53:49] the trodden way the way of life
[53:52] and you can see that abundantly because
[53:54] you see israel here's jeremiah
[53:56] you know babylon's going to come and and
[53:58] destroy them and take them into
[53:59] captivity and you ask the question how
[54:01] did they get in that predicament that's
[54:03] right
[54:04] they left the leader they left divine
[54:06] leadership
[54:07] and now and they're following their own
[54:09] ways they are religious they are god's
[54:11] chosen people
[54:13] amen they didn't deny jehovah flat right
[54:16] but they had left divine leadership and
[54:19] now following their own ways and that's
[54:21] how they ended up in this predicament
[54:23] because if they just followed god's
[54:24] provided way they would never been
[54:26] carried away into captivity but moses
[54:28] said this would happen
[54:30] in deuteronomy he said this was going to
[54:32] happen and it was happening
[54:34] and no doubt no doubt when the children
[54:36] of israel there and moses you read
[54:38] deuteronomy he says if you turn from god
[54:41] this is what's going to happen to you
[54:43] he says he gives blessings and cursings
[54:46] he says the cursing is the result of
[54:47] turning from god's word and no doubt
[54:50] that generation that was there they
[54:52] heard moses speak these things
[54:54] yeah because
[54:56] you know i put myself you know where the
[54:58] believer is in the word and no doubt
[55:00] they'd have in their heart
[55:01] i'm going to teach this to my children
[55:03] we are not going to be taken out of this
[55:05] land that god's given us we're going to
[55:07] stand according to his word
[55:09] it's not going to be my generation
[55:11] that's going to go into captivity that
[55:12] would have been their burden
[55:14] amen but then as generations went down
[55:17] it shifted from divine leadership now to
[55:20] human leadership
[55:24] so now it is not in man
[55:27] to direct the steps
[55:30] and that's why people say well i just
[55:31] want to go my own way
[55:33] you can't go your own way
[55:35] you can't go
[55:36] this little and you you're thinking
[55:39] you say well people think well i can
[55:41] just plan it out i can put all the facts
[55:42] out and go according to that that's what
[55:45] the world has been doing
[55:46] why do we have war why do we have death
[55:48] why do we have greed and famine and all
[55:50] these different things
[55:52] because man has said i'm going my own
[55:53] way
[55:54] the world has the ability to wipe out
[55:56] poverty
[55:57] the world has the ability to wipe out
[56:00] hunger
[56:01] it has the ability
[56:03] but the greed of fallen man
[56:05] doesn't let it happen
[56:08] why because man is going its own way
[56:12] now
[56:14] and it's also but the main course of the
[56:16] problem is man is not willing to humble
[56:19] itself to the leadership of god
[56:22] man is not willing to humble itself
[56:25] and it even says in james 4 verse 6 but
[56:28] he giveth more grace wherefore he saith
[56:30] god resists the proud
[56:32] but he give us grace unto the humble so
[56:34] god actually actively resists the proud
[56:38] amen proud and religion proud and
[56:40] whatever it may be god resists those
[56:41] people
[56:43] and i think they're doing the right
[56:44] thing
[56:46] but you see
[56:48] you know so man man in itself
[56:51] you know there was a there was a podcast
[56:53] radio thing over in america that's
[56:56] called the art of happiness or the
[56:57] pursuit of happiness
[56:59] and these people say just look within
[57:00] yourself this is not that many years ago
[57:02] they said just just just look within
[57:04] yourself you'll find happiness do you
[57:06] know what happened to the two people the
[57:07] husband and wife that that founded that
[57:09] thing
[57:10] they put bags over their head
[57:12] and they put tubes in there and they
[57:14] killed themselves
[57:15] they they guessed themselves
[57:17] and these are the people saying you'll
[57:18] find the
[57:20] yo yo you'll find happiness if you just
[57:22] look within yourself
[57:24] and
[57:25] look where they ended up and i just feel
[57:27] sorry for them because they were saying
[57:29] because they just said no man has it
[57:30] within themselves to to find happiness
[57:33] man doesn't have
[57:34] man sure does not have it in themselves
[57:37] i'm sure you can agree that's why
[57:38] there's pain there's broken families
[57:40] there's all these pains and hurts in the
[57:42] world because man says i'm going to do
[57:43] it my own way
[57:45] they reject the leadership of god and
[57:47] they are led by something else
[57:49] and it's normally their own selfish
[57:51] ambition that takes them there
[57:55] now
[57:56] let's go to ephesians chapter 2.
[58:08] ephesians two verse one
[58:10] because you see
[58:12] you know if this isn't such a shouty
[58:13] happy service it's all right i can't
[58:15] have expected it
[58:16] but you know i don't mind
[58:20] but
[58:21] it's very important you say what am i
[58:23] being led by you you really got to think
[58:25] about it
[58:27] so ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1.
[58:32] and we'll you know
[58:34] let's just read the verse first two
[58:35] verses
[58:36] and you have he quickened who were dead
[58:38] in trespasses and sins wherein in times
[58:40] past you walked according to the course
[58:42] of this world according to the prince of
[58:45] the power of the year the spirit that
[58:46] now worketh in the children of
[58:48] disobedience so
[58:50] paul was saying to these ephesians that
[58:52] had come out of what
[58:54] whatever they came out of they came into
[58:56] christ are sealed into the kingdom he
[58:57] said one time you actually been governed
[58:59] by it you're being led by something else
[59:02] you're being led by the spirit of the
[59:03] prince of the power of the air that's
[59:05] what he's saying here he's saying your
[59:07] your leadership was not god at one time
[59:10] you're being led by a demon spirit
[59:14] there's only two
[59:15] this shouldn't shock you free it
[59:16] shouldn't it shouldn't be shocking at
[59:18] all
[59:18] and you know no doubt it didn't matter
[59:20] what what what facet of society they are
[59:22] from didn't matter what religion they
[59:24] had they'd just been governed
[59:27] they walked according to the course of
[59:29] this world
[59:31] they were led
[59:32] you know and
[59:34] paul just in that one statement
[59:35] encompasses all of humanity
[59:38] amen he said once upon a time you're
[59:40] walking this way
[59:42] but then now another leadership has come
[59:44] into your life because we're all led by
[59:46] something
[59:48] yeah
[59:49] so he's saying now one time you you
[59:52] walked according to this spirit so this
[59:54] this this unseen and maybe they had no
[59:57] idea of spiritual things i don't know
[59:59] but he's trying to open their
[1:00:00] understanding that that actually
[1:00:03] the road you were going down it wasn't
[1:00:05] you ultimately doing it but you yield
[1:00:07] yourself to another inspiration
[1:00:09] to another spirit leading you
[1:00:12] and
[1:00:14] but then he says now
[1:00:16] he says also in verse three among whom
[1:00:18] you also also we all had our
[1:00:20] conversation which is manner of life and
[1:00:22] times past and the lusts of our flesh
[1:00:24] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:00:26] of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:00:28] children of wrath even as others
[1:00:31] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:00:33] great lover and he loved us even when we
[1:00:36] were dead in sins is quicken us together
[1:00:38] with christ by grace you are saved and
[1:00:40] has raised us up together and made us
[1:00:41] sit in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:00:44] that in the ages that come he might show
[1:00:45] the exceeding riches of his grace and
[1:00:47] his kindness towards us through christ
[1:00:50] jesus for by grace you are saved through
[1:00:52] faith and not of yourselves it is the
[1:00:54] gift of god not of works least any man
[1:00:57] should boast we are his workmanship
[1:00:59] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:01:02] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:01:04] should walk in them
[1:01:06] now
[1:01:09] a multitude of people quote that
[1:01:10] scripture
[1:01:12] and a multitude of people say that's me
[1:01:16] i was delivered from something and now
[1:01:18] i'm a christian
[1:01:20] but then now
[1:01:21] you take those people remember i said
[1:01:24] last sunday
[1:01:25] an orange tree produces oranges
[1:01:28] you don't judge the orange tree you just
[1:01:30] discern well it makes oranges
[1:01:32] and then an apple tree produces apples
[1:01:34] fig tree figs you know it's just what
[1:01:36] they make but jesus said now if they you
[1:01:39] know he said yeah i am the vine you are
[1:01:42] the branches
[1:01:44] so a certain fruit will be produced from
[1:01:46] the true believer a life will be
[1:01:48] produced that is that is particular only
[1:01:50] to the true believer
[1:01:52] and so we have to look now
[1:01:56] you take you know everyone who you know
[1:01:58] you know who can quote this verse and
[1:02:00] they believe um a whole myriad of
[1:02:02] different things
[1:02:03] and they have all different kind of
[1:02:04] understandings on the scripture i ask
[1:02:06] the question what is leading them
[1:02:10] and and and i put the true believer in
[1:02:12] that bracket you take all of
[1:02:13] christianity
[1:02:14] and that all quote that scripture jesus
[1:02:16] blood is save me i believe in the cross
[1:02:19] but what is what is being produced
[1:02:22] and what is leading them
[1:02:25] yeah i'm taking this deliberately slow
[1:02:27] because i want it to sink in pretty deep
[1:02:29] you know so
[1:02:30] because jesus said when the spirit of
[1:02:33] truth has come he'll lead you and guide
[1:02:35] you into all truth
[1:02:37] so if there's people so there are people
[1:02:39] upon the earth that are being led and
[1:02:40] guided into all truth
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:44] those people are under divine leadership
[1:02:47] but there's also people upon the earth
[1:02:49] that are not being led into all truth
[1:02:53] amen yeah
[1:02:55] this may be very elementary but you know
[1:02:57] you have to say well you're making a
[1:02:59] true and a false absolutely there's a
[1:03:00] true and a fault you've got to test the
[1:03:03] spirits you've got to actually discern
[1:03:04] now is this god or is this not god
[1:03:07] if it is god give everything to it if
[1:03:09] it's not just forget about it
[1:03:11] amen and then you got to bring it down
[1:03:12] into your own life am i am i being led
[1:03:16] divinely led
[1:03:18] or am i not being divinely led
[1:03:20] if you're not being divinely led he's
[1:03:22] here to lead you
[1:03:23] if you're willing to give yourself over
[1:03:25] to him
[1:03:26] amen and if he is leading you you should
[1:03:28] rejoice hallelujah
[1:03:32] now
[1:03:33] because you've got to ask the question
[1:03:35] what motivated the scribes and pharisees
[1:03:37] the religious world the churches of
[1:03:39] jesus day what motivated them to reject
[1:03:42] christ
[1:03:44] it wasn't it wasn't the spirit of god
[1:03:47] it wasn't but yet they could claim
[1:03:49] remember because i said this walking
[1:03:51] according to the course of this world
[1:03:53] according to the prince of the power of
[1:03:54] the year
[1:03:56] that that is not a just an atheist you
[1:03:58] know atheist spirit or some other
[1:04:00] religion you know
[1:04:02] that's where it comes in among the true
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] it says the same things
[1:04:09] it uses the same scripture
[1:04:12] you know you take the scribes and
[1:04:13] pharisees they believe the messiah was
[1:04:15] coming they believed they said we have
[1:04:17] we are moses disciple we believe what
[1:04:20] moses said
[1:04:21] you know and and that so they believed
[1:04:24] and then they even sent people down to
[1:04:25] john when he was baptizing are you the
[1:04:27] christ
[1:04:28] because they are under expectation that
[1:04:29] he was going to come
[1:04:31] and they even thought he's going to come
[1:04:33] but then when he came
[1:04:36] they didn't accept him they rejected
[1:04:38] him but then you take the woman at the
[1:04:41] well we know where messiah comes he'll
[1:04:43] do these things so they both had the
[1:04:45] same scripture but one was being
[1:04:47] divinely led to become one with that
[1:04:49] messiah and the other group was
[1:04:50] rejecting him
[1:04:52] so
[1:04:53] you know there was a religion you know
[1:04:55] it was you know it was so close
[1:04:57] it was close because they both said the
[1:04:59] same thing they both claimed to believe
[1:05:01] the same thing but when the word made
[1:05:03] was made flesh among them that really
[1:05:05] was the dividing line
[1:05:07] are these people being later are these
[1:05:08] people being led by god
[1:05:12] and then we can see this in first kings
[1:05:14] chapter 22 that's why this because satan
[1:05:16] is a religious being
[1:05:18] he wants to be worshiped he said i will
[1:05:20] ascend above the you know i will you
[1:05:22] know i will ascend i'll be like the most
[1:05:24] highest isn't isaiah
[1:05:26] well the most highest god in other words
[1:05:28] i'll be worshipped as god and paul
[1:05:30] speaks about in second thessalonians
[1:05:31] that he that he'll be in the temple of
[1:05:33] god showing himself that he is god
[1:05:36] worshipped
[1:05:38] and that's his ambition
[1:05:40] so it's a it's a it's in religious
[1:05:43] nature
[1:05:44] above all things
[1:05:46] and then we can see this we can see this
[1:05:49] in in first kings chapter 22
[1:05:52] we have the story of ahab
[1:05:55] he he goes to the king of judah which is
[1:05:58] jehoshaphat
[1:05:59] and he says
[1:06:01] let's go take ramoff gilead back from
[1:06:03] the back from syria
[1:06:05] and so that used to be a part of israel
[1:06:07] but the syrians had taken it over
[1:06:10] so there
[1:06:11] so it was it was it was their land they
[1:06:14] had a right to reclaim it
[1:06:16] so their their ambition was right you
[1:06:19] could unders you know yeah i'm sure he
[1:06:20] could agree their ambition was right
[1:06:23] their cause seemed right
[1:06:26] but there was something very lacking in
[1:06:28] their understanding
[1:06:31] and that was
[1:06:32] that elijah had prophesied just the
[1:06:34] chapter before he says the dogs will
[1:06:37] lick ahab's blood
[1:06:39] so there's a prophecy he'd already come
[1:06:41] out that ahab had to die and the dogs
[1:06:43] lick his blood
[1:06:45] and so that had to be fulfilled but then
[1:06:47] if we go down into that scene and to
[1:06:49] save time we won't read it but but go
[1:06:51] away and read first kings uh 21 and 22
[1:06:55] you know ahab had 400 hebrew prophets
[1:06:58] and and they consulted them because
[1:07:00] jehovah you know you know jehoshaphat
[1:07:02] said well shouldn't we consult god first
[1:07:05] you know shouldn't we
[1:07:07] and then
[1:07:08] and then so ahab said well i've got 400
[1:07:10] hebrew prophets these aren't these
[1:07:12] aren't prophets of baal they're hebrew
[1:07:13] prophets
[1:07:14] and then they all said with one accord
[1:07:16] go up for the lands yours go up you know
[1:07:18] they they prophesied and they had one he
[1:07:20] made two horns of vine said by this
[1:07:22] you'll push the syrians out of the land
[1:07:25] now that sounds pretty good
[1:07:27] because
[1:07:29] there's 400 people saying the same thing
[1:07:32] and how many times
[1:07:34] how many times have you ever heard
[1:07:35] someone say
[1:07:37] you know
[1:07:39] you got something on your heart and then
[1:07:42] someone comes along and basically says
[1:07:44] what you're thinking about should i do
[1:07:46] this is this right someone says
[1:07:48] and they say that's a confirmation from
[1:07:50] god
[1:07:52] is it
[1:07:54] amen sometimes it is
[1:07:57] sometimes it's not
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] i want you to think deep
[1:08:02] i want you to think real deep this
[1:08:03] morning
[1:08:06] and then so here's 400 prophets saying
[1:08:07] let's go up and take the land and then
[1:08:09] jehoshaphat says well isn't there one
[1:08:11] more
[1:08:12] isn't there one more prophet he had a
[1:08:13] bit more spiritual bone than ahab and
[1:08:15] then ahab said there is one more micah
[1:08:17] but i hate him
[1:08:18] because he always prophesies against me
[1:08:21] and then says jehoshaphat says don't let
[1:08:22] the king say so let's go get him and
[1:08:24] then so some of them go and get micah he
[1:08:26] says you say what they said
[1:08:29] and then and then we'll have fellowship
[1:08:30] again and micah says i'll only say what
[1:08:32] god puts in my mouth amen
[1:08:35] now now if you bring it into modern
[1:08:36] times you'd say here's 400 and they're
[1:08:38] all saying the same thing with one heart
[1:08:40] and one accord and it's according to the
[1:08:42] word that we should take that
[1:08:44] it was a different season
[1:08:46] ahab's blood had to be licked by some
[1:08:47] dogs he had to die
[1:08:49] and then so micah said i'll only say
[1:08:51] what god told me to say and then the
[1:08:53] next day he comes out
[1:08:54] and then micah says i see israel
[1:08:57] scattered without a shepherd
[1:08:59] and then the chief one of the 400
[1:09:01] prophets that made the horns he smacks
[1:09:03] him in the mouth and says when did the
[1:09:05] spirit of god come out of me and go on
[1:09:07] to you
[1:09:08] he says yeah and then he said he said i
[1:09:10] saw i saw in heaven there's a conference
[1:09:12] in heaven see now i was going beyond
[1:09:14] just what you see going up into the
[1:09:16] eternal realm
[1:09:17] and then and god was having a conference
[1:09:19] saying how are we going to cause ahab to
[1:09:21] come into battle to die
[1:09:23] how we're going to get the word to be
[1:09:24] fulfilled and then a lying spirit comes
[1:09:26] out of hell and says let me get in those
[1:09:28] hebrew prophets
[1:09:30] and then god gave him consent so these
[1:09:33] 400
[1:09:34] they were inspired they were anointed
[1:09:38] they were all with one accord
[1:09:40] but yet
[1:09:42] they were anointed by the wrong spirit
[1:09:44] but they could say at that moment we are
[1:09:46] divinely led we're being led by god
[1:09:52] and then you know and then you read the
[1:09:54] rest of the story that go into battle
[1:09:56] and before that ahab says take micah put
[1:09:59] him in the yo yo in the prison feed in
[1:10:02] the bread of sorrow in the water of
[1:10:03] sorrow
[1:10:04] and micah says if you come back at all
[1:10:07] god hasn't spoken to me
[1:10:09] and ahab dies in the battle of dogs lick
[1:10:10] his blood
[1:10:12] exactly as elijah said exactly according
[1:10:14] to the word that came through elijah
[1:10:18] so
[1:10:20] before micah has that vision
[1:10:23] of heaven and what was going on you'd
[1:10:25] say which one was divinely led
[1:10:29] amen see you got to know you you must
[1:10:32] know
[1:10:34] just because someone comes to you and
[1:10:35] says god told me this you should do this
[1:10:38] you got to have a witness in your heart
[1:10:40] if that's what god is telling you to do
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:45] and then you've got to take it back to
[1:10:46] the scripture to say is this god's plan
[1:10:48] for my life
[1:10:49] is this really what god wants me to do
[1:10:53] remember they were hebrew prophets they
[1:10:55] were they were believers
[1:10:57] they wanted to see the land be reclaimed
[1:11:00] it was part of their inheritance that
[1:11:02] the devil had
[1:11:04] but they were anointed by the wrong
[1:11:06] spirit they didn't even know it
[1:11:08] amen because they didn't take their
[1:11:10] vision or their inspiration they didn't
[1:11:12] take it back to the word of what elijah
[1:11:14] had just said
[1:11:18] now
[1:11:19] divine leadership must be according to
[1:11:21] god's word
[1:11:23] ultimately
[1:11:25] how do you know you're led by god you've
[1:11:26] got to take it back to the scripture
[1:11:31] and then it must be so it must be
[1:11:33] according to god's word and it must be
[1:11:34] according to god's way
[1:11:37] and we can see this in 2nd samuel
[1:11:39] chapter 6 where david
[1:11:42] david wanted to bring the ark of the
[1:11:44] covenant into his city
[1:11:47] and what happened was
[1:11:48] he was trying to so so so his motive was
[1:11:51] right because where the ark was where
[1:11:53] the prince of god was so his motive was
[1:11:55] right he wanted he wanted god and among
[1:11:57] the people
[1:11:59] so his motive was right he was anointed
[1:12:01] king he was a he was a genuine man
[1:12:04] he was a genuine believer
[1:12:06] but the method that he tried to bring
[1:12:08] the arkhan was on a new cart
[1:12:10] instead of being on the shoulder of the
[1:12:12] levites that was god's provided way he
[1:12:15] put it on a new cart
[1:12:17] so
[1:12:18] the method that which he was he was
[1:12:21] bringing the ark into the city was wrong
[1:12:24] though his motive was right
[1:12:26] and he could say i feel divinely led
[1:12:29] amen i feel divinely led to do this
[1:12:32] but the way he was doing it was wrong
[1:12:35] amen and we understand you know the
[1:12:37] story you know you know the oxen
[1:12:39] stumbled
[1:12:40] and the ark was going to fall off the
[1:12:42] cart and a and a good man put his hand
[1:12:44] hold it to try and keep the word in its
[1:12:46] place and he was struck dead
[1:12:49] and they called uh holt david said stop
[1:12:52] this right now something's wrong
[1:12:54] a good man has lost his life out of my
[1:12:56] good intentions see that's why man's
[1:12:58] good intentions has to be according to
[1:13:00] the work
[1:13:01] david had good intentions but it was not
[1:13:03] according to the scripture
[1:13:05] and that's and it even says that they
[1:13:08] um you know you know they didn't just do
[1:13:10] this uh you know they did this with with
[1:13:13] great sincerity
[1:13:14] it says in second samuel 6 and 5 and and
[1:13:17] david and all the house of israel played
[1:13:20] before the lord on all manner of
[1:13:21] instruments made of furwood even on
[1:13:23] harps and upholsteries and on timbrels
[1:13:26] and on and of cornets and on symbols so
[1:13:28] they were you know they really put
[1:13:30] everything they had because this was a
[1:13:31] special day that the ark was coming into
[1:13:34] the city but it wasn't according to
[1:13:36] god's plan
[1:13:38] it wasn't according to god's way
[1:13:40] because if you read that scripture david
[1:13:42] consulted with the captain you know and
[1:13:44] all the people and they said that's a
[1:13:46] wonderful idea let's let's bring the ark
[1:13:48] into the city but there was one person
[1:13:51] he didn't consult
[1:13:52] and that one person was the one he
[1:13:54] should have consulted which was nathan
[1:13:55] the prophet
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:58] so he would have consulted the levites
[1:14:00] he would have consulted all the
[1:14:01] religious people
[1:14:03] and they all said let's do it david
[1:14:05] absolutely god's with you you're our
[1:14:06] anointed king we love you
[1:14:09] but then what happened
[1:14:11] a good man died
[1:14:13] but they would have said see i'm trying
[1:14:15] to bring this whole divine it's it it
[1:14:17] comes to a real thin point
[1:14:19] amen real real
[1:14:22] you know it's not it's not just a broad
[1:14:24] yo yo brush stroke you're the leader
[1:14:26] you're not lead well ultimately you are
[1:14:28] but you've got to come down to real hone
[1:14:30] it down is this god's provided way
[1:14:32] how how we're meant to do things or is
[1:14:34] this not
[1:14:37] and then so uzi died and brother brown
[1:14:39] preached a sermon trying to do god a
[1:14:40] service without it being his will
[1:14:43] many times when you put that sermon on
[1:14:45] the denominations because he says they
[1:14:46] made a new denominational cut which
[1:14:48] wasn't god's provided way to bring the
[1:14:50] word and it caused the death of a good
[1:14:52] man
[1:14:53] but then you've got to bring it down
[1:14:54] you've got to put it on your shoulders
[1:14:57] amen you got to you got to put that in
[1:14:58] your lap
[1:14:59] am i trying to do god or service without
[1:15:02] it being his will
[1:15:04] because it sounds good it may sound
[1:15:06] right it may make sense
[1:15:08] but is it god's way of doing things
[1:15:14] and so he failed to consult the prophet
[1:15:17] and the word lord always comes to the
[1:15:18] prophet
[1:15:20] amen he failed to consult the message of
[1:15:22] the hour bringing into our day's
[1:15:24] language
[1:15:25] he failed to consult the word
[1:15:28] and it caused a good man to die
[1:15:30] now
[1:15:33] they all claimed to be led by god and
[1:15:36] david was a genuine believer
[1:15:38] i mean he wasn't a make-believer he was
[1:15:40] a real he was a real believer
[1:15:42] but but but the way he wanted to do
[1:15:44] things was wrong
[1:15:47] and we have this for as many are led uh
[1:15:49] by the spirit of god they are the sons
[1:15:51] of god
[1:15:53] and this led in the greek it means to
[1:15:56] you know it means to drive it means to
[1:15:58] induce it means to bring
[1:16:00] you know you know bring forth to carry
[1:16:03] so something that's actually driving
[1:16:04] someone
[1:16:08] and he says he says in the um
[1:16:11] unconditional covenant he says so give
[1:16:13] us courage tonight give us faith give us
[1:16:16] give give leadership and let the holy
[1:16:18] spirit the real divine leader of the new
[1:16:20] testament of the holy ghost church may
[1:16:23] he lead us all the way into that perfect
[1:16:25] faith perfect love one for another make
[1:16:28] us lord so much in love that'd be hard
[1:16:30] to leave the building just tie our
[1:16:33] hearts together as one and may we be in
[1:16:35] one accord and may the same holy spirit
[1:16:37] that came on the day of pentecost
[1:16:40] to go forth and to bring forth the seed
[1:16:42] of abraham to the promise of god may he
[1:16:44] do his work tonight here in this
[1:16:46] building i say may do his work this
[1:16:47] morning here in this building before i
[1:16:49] ask it in jesus name amen amen
[1:16:53] you notice the levites had to carry the
[1:16:55] ark that was god's provided way so it
[1:16:57] was the because the ark represents the
[1:16:59] word of god
[1:17:00] so the word had to be carried upon the
[1:17:02] heart over the heart of a levite that
[1:17:04] was god's provided way and it couldn't
[1:17:06] have been just any you know you know it
[1:17:09] couldn't just be any anyone carrying the
[1:17:11] word now remember we are a nation of
[1:17:13] kings and priests under god
[1:17:15] yeah
[1:17:17] and
[1:17:18] you know you know the priests they
[1:17:19] didn't just come into the office
[1:17:20] haphazardly they had to be cleansed a
[1:17:22] certain way they had to dress a certain
[1:17:24] way i mean they had to be prepared for
[1:17:27] that event otherwise they would have
[1:17:28] been struck dead
[1:17:30] and so the same with us we can't carry
[1:17:32] the word
[1:17:33] we can't carry the word amen with a
[1:17:36] defiled heart amen you can't carry the
[1:17:38] word not being sanctified amen amen you
[1:17:41] can't carry the word not being cleansed
[1:17:43] by the power of god
[1:17:45] we all carry the word
[1:17:46] you understand that it takes a sincere
[1:17:49] dedicated heart that's been washed by
[1:17:51] the power of the blood
[1:17:53] i mean to really carry the word because
[1:17:55] many people have taken up the scripture
[1:17:59] and they may have the right ambition
[1:18:00] they may have the right motive they
[1:18:02] think
[1:18:03] but it's caused death
[1:18:05] upon good people
[1:18:07] amen and upon good families it's caused
[1:18:10] death
[1:18:11] because it hasn't been carried right
[1:18:15] i say the lord help us
[1:18:17] amen and that's the error we are
[1:18:20] carrying the word
[1:18:21] i'm not just talking about ministry
[1:18:22] every day we live a sermon
[1:18:24] every day we preach a sermon
[1:18:27] and if we
[1:18:29] if we
[1:18:30] bring it in
[1:18:31] a wrong way
[1:18:33] it'll cause death somewhere along the
[1:18:35] way
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:39] so we have to we have to be prepared
[1:18:41] that's why that's why it's a faithful
[1:18:43] thing
[1:18:44] i mean to come into the presence of god
[1:18:47] it's a fearful thing it's a wonderful
[1:18:49] thing because we know he paid it all
[1:18:51] and we don't come in our own ability we
[1:18:53] come in his ability
[1:18:54] but god is not god is not mocked
[1:18:57] whatever you sow you'll reap
[1:18:59] and god is not an old granddad he'll
[1:19:02] he'll chastise us he'll do whatever he
[1:19:04] needs to do to get us into our position
[1:19:06] and he's not afraid to do whatever he
[1:19:08] needs to do because he's going to lead
[1:19:10] us
[1:19:11] he's determined he says i'm your father
[1:19:12] you're my children
[1:19:14] amen and whom a father loves he
[1:19:16] chastises he corrects not just to
[1:19:19] frustrate them not just to frustrate you
[1:19:21] he wants to guide you
[1:19:23] in the way that you should go
[1:19:25] god is not you know god is you know his
[1:19:27] his his his love is is supreme but his
[1:19:31] judgment correction is very severe
[1:19:34] amen this is you know
[1:19:36] our god is a severe you know his
[1:19:38] holiness he's a holy god
[1:19:40] i mean he loves us more than anything he
[1:19:43] you know he says about you know how much
[1:19:45] he loves us but he doesn't just let us
[1:19:47] get by with things david took bathsheba
[1:19:52] had had had her husband murdered
[1:19:55] and he was a righteous man
[1:19:58] and then apparently it was two years
[1:19:59] after the event here comes nathan the
[1:20:01] prophet and gives the parable one man
[1:20:04] had one sheep
[1:20:05] and another man had a whole big flock of
[1:20:07] sheep
[1:20:08] and then
[1:20:09] the man with the whole flock of sheep
[1:20:11] was having a feast he said i won't take
[1:20:12] one of my sheep i'll go steal this man's
[1:20:14] sheep
[1:20:15] and kill it and prepare it and feed the
[1:20:17] guests
[1:20:18] and then
[1:20:20] and then nathan asked david what should
[1:20:22] happen to this man and david said it's a
[1:20:24] wicked man he should just be dealt with
[1:20:26] and then nathan said you're the man
[1:20:29] you are that man
[1:20:31] so david must have thought two years
[1:20:32] down the road i just got by with this
[1:20:35] amen he didn't get by with it
[1:20:39] god waits sometimes
[1:20:41] then god deals with it
[1:20:44] amen but god allowed but the reason that
[1:20:48] and that was proof though of god's love
[1:20:50] for david because no adulterer will see
[1:20:52] heaven no fornicator will see heaven the
[1:20:54] scripture tells us i mean he said david
[1:20:57] had to put that right
[1:20:58] that was god's love
[1:21:03] now
[1:21:05] this is go tell my disciples
[1:21:07] all of the prophets of old
[1:21:10] not having any scripture to go as we
[1:21:12] have any divine promise of god only
[1:21:14] through the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:21:16] men of old as they were moved by the
[1:21:19] holy ghost wrote the word
[1:21:21] each one of them when they died they
[1:21:23] specified they wanted to be buried in
[1:21:24] palestine they did um they died out of
[1:21:27] palestine many of them but they wanted
[1:21:29] to be buried in palestine because god
[1:21:31] gave the first fruits of the
[1:21:32] resurrection out of palestine so they
[1:21:34] didn't have a bible you know moses wrote
[1:21:36] the first five books however many
[1:21:38] thousand odd years since adam i don't
[1:21:40] know how long it was but it was that was
[1:21:42] when the bible was put together before
[1:21:44] they didn't have a bible
[1:21:46] but yet they were under divine
[1:21:47] leadership
[1:21:48] what they're doing they were divinely
[1:21:50] led
[1:21:52] now i just want to go through abraham
[1:21:54] quickly
[1:21:55] yeah that's probably my foundation so
[1:21:57] i'm going to build on it
[1:21:59] now
[1:22:00] abraham
[1:22:02] i'm sure we all can agree abraham was
[1:22:04] divinely led by god
[1:22:06] amen he was divinely led by god
[1:22:09] and
[1:22:11] now
[1:22:12] that leadership started with a call
[1:22:15] he was called and i think genesis 12 get
[1:22:17] out of this country and go yo you know
[1:22:19] you're the land of your kindred and i'll
[1:22:21] show you a place and i'll make you a
[1:22:23] father of many nations there was a
[1:22:24] divine call
[1:22:26] that came through and through that call
[1:22:28] he became under the leadership of god
[1:22:32] and then so abraham had a divine call
[1:22:36] now but there's something so so so in
[1:22:39] order to be led there's things a leader
[1:22:41] must do
[1:22:43] okay so maybe i'm going to turn a corner
[1:22:45] here but i just
[1:22:46] trust it all works together now you know
[1:22:49] a leader must give a vision of of of
[1:22:51] what's the end goal
[1:22:53] in order to to lead correctly they must
[1:22:56] give a vision this is what we're aiming
[1:22:57] towards
[1:22:58] because if you don't have an end goal
[1:23:00] all the people you're trying to lead
[1:23:02] will just lose the vision you know you
[1:23:04] know they'll just
[1:23:05] you know you know there won't be a
[1:23:06] fervency there won't be desire to to to
[1:23:09] see it achieved
[1:23:10] so there must be an end result this is
[1:23:12] what we're aiming for and this is what
[1:23:14] god did when he first called abraham he
[1:23:16] says get the out of thy country and from
[1:23:18] my kindred and from my father's house
[1:23:20] into a land that i will show thee and
[1:23:22] i'll make thee a great nation i'll bless
[1:23:24] thee and make thy name great and thou
[1:23:26] shall be a blessing so he's already
[1:23:28] given this is the end result you're
[1:23:30] going to receive a land that's not here
[1:23:32] and you're going to be a father of
[1:23:33] nations i'm going to make your name
[1:23:34] great
[1:23:36] so so he'd already told him this is the
[1:23:38] end goal
[1:23:40] and then so abraham dropped under that
[1:23:42] divine leadership and he began to walk
[1:23:44] according to what he was just
[1:23:46] told so and then as as god was as
[1:23:51] abraham was walking with god
[1:23:53] god revealed more now of of that call
[1:23:57] because you know
[1:23:58] you know when he's first called he says
[1:24:00] i'll give you a land but then afterwards
[1:24:01] he says this is the borders of the land
[1:24:04] and then and then he hones it even down
[1:24:06] more he says now sir now you and sarah
[1:24:07] are going to have the promise son not
[1:24:09] just out of you but now sarah's part of
[1:24:11] the promise
[1:24:12] you know and then so so so they so the
[1:24:15] promise we could say
[1:24:17] the
[1:24:18] the revelation that abraham received was
[1:24:20] honed down
[1:24:22] to more of a concrete thing
[1:24:25] and then so this was done that abraham
[1:24:28] would keep us focused
[1:24:30] because it was 25 years from when he was
[1:24:32] called to when he had isaac 25 years is
[1:24:34] a long time
[1:24:35] but god god kept him focused because he
[1:24:38] kept confirming his covenant with
[1:24:40] abraham over and over again
[1:24:45] and paul
[1:24:46] and so so he kept his focus
[1:24:49] and that call was a central drive of his
[1:24:51] life
[1:24:52] and we're talking about divine
[1:24:54] leadership who believes they are
[1:24:55] divinely led
[1:24:58] amen who believes they're divinely led
[1:25:00] then if you've been divinely called to
[1:25:02] do a certain thing keep it central
[1:25:05] whatever you do keep it central you say
[1:25:07] well what am i called to do you call to
[1:25:09] take a rapture in this hour you're
[1:25:11] called to become the very image of
[1:25:13] christ upon the earth a mature believer
[1:25:15] that we're called to do
[1:25:16] amen we're called to raise our children
[1:25:19] the way that they should go and let's
[1:25:21] not just bring them to church every
[1:25:22] sunday
[1:25:25] i should hear an amen from that amen
[1:25:27] amen because because what happens now if
[1:25:30] you raise them just out there
[1:25:32] and then now we have two hours every
[1:25:34] sunday morning well then actually you're
[1:25:35] raising them to go out there
[1:25:38] because that is the way that they've
[1:25:39] actually taught to go
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:43] but their whole life is encompassing
[1:25:45] everything we do is because we love the
[1:25:46] lord
[1:25:47] and it's every facet of every you know
[1:25:49] every part of life is jesus christ then
[1:25:52] you'll raise them in the way that they
[1:25:54] should go
[1:25:56] amen you've got to keep that you've got
[1:25:58] to keep it
[1:25:59] central you've been divinely called and
[1:26:01] this is what you're meant to do
[1:26:04] you know if paul i don't know how many
[1:26:06] years down the road he stood in front of
[1:26:08] king agrippa
[1:26:10] he says whereupon oh king agrippa is not
[1:26:12] disobedient unto the heavenly vision and
[1:26:14] before that he relates the road to
[1:26:16] damascus experience
[1:26:18] he says i have not been disobedient to
[1:26:20] that one heavenly vision he was divinely
[1:26:23] called and he came under divine
[1:26:24] leadership
[1:26:26] and we
[1:26:28] i trust i trust you can see yourself in
[1:26:29] those stories
[1:26:31] i mean that we've been divinely called
[1:26:32] by a voice and it wasn't a voice from
[1:26:35] kentucky as a voice out of heaven
[1:26:37] i mean it wasn't just a man preaching
[1:26:39] but god came and confirmed that word
[1:26:41] multitudes of people came up on the
[1:26:43] platform
[1:26:44] this is your name this is where you're
[1:26:46] from this is your address this is why
[1:26:48] you're here is that true and you can
[1:26:49] hear them say it's true is that true
[1:26:51] it's true why because the spirit of
[1:26:53] truth was revealing what was going on
[1:26:55] and then point out to the audience you
[1:26:56] there you there this is what's wrong
[1:26:58] with you
[1:26:59] amen and every time
[1:27:01] it was true
[1:27:03] and god came in he says in quite a few
[1:27:05] sermons
[1:27:06] if i have said the truth and i are the
[1:27:08] true servant of god let him come forth
[1:27:10] now and prove that it's true
[1:27:13] and god did
[1:27:15] why says more than a man oh it's a bunch
[1:27:17] of shirts more than just a bunch of
[1:27:18] sermons it's christ being revealed it's
[1:27:21] divine leadership coming upon the earth
[1:27:23] once again
[1:27:24] i mean to lead a people into a rapture
[1:27:27] hallelujah
[1:27:29] so now a leader
[1:27:32] so so a leader keeps people focused he
[1:27:35] says this is our end goal
[1:27:37] amen this is what a leader does
[1:27:39] but then also a leader
[1:27:41] cultivates the people under them
[1:27:44] or under yeah amen that's right so a
[1:27:46] leader cultivates what is in the people
[1:27:50] now
[1:27:51] abraham
[1:27:54] abraham had to be cultivated
[1:27:57] amen yup hebrews 11 verse 17 it says by
[1:28:00] faith abraham when he was tried offered
[1:28:04] up isaac
[1:28:05] and and that
[1:28:06] and he that had received the promise of
[1:28:09] offered up his only begotten son
[1:28:12] so this word try in the in the greek
[1:28:16] it means to test
[1:28:18] and and it's where we get the word assay
[1:28:20] from
[1:28:22] so he was actually assad abraham was
[1:28:24] being assayed abraham was being tested
[1:28:28] and this was all done because okay i'll
[1:28:30] take i'll take like you're a rock for
[1:28:32] example if you're looking for you know
[1:28:34] you know gold or any precious metal they
[1:28:37] they drill a big core sample out
[1:28:39] then they take that thing and then they
[1:28:41] take sections of it because they want to
[1:28:43] know what depth
[1:28:45] all the minerals are and they put it
[1:28:46] into a ball mill and they crush that
[1:28:48] rock into powder
[1:28:50] and they do certain chemical tests to
[1:28:53] see what is in that what is in that
[1:28:55] section of rock and that's where we get
[1:28:57] and that is being assayed that is
[1:28:59] assaying the rock where it once was a
[1:29:01] big
[1:29:02] column of rock and then it's crushed a
[1:29:04] powder and then it's examined
[1:29:06] what's in it
[1:29:08] and so when abraham and because you want
[1:29:10] to see what's in the rock
[1:29:12] amen so when abraham was being tried he
[1:29:15] was being assayed
[1:29:17] he was being ground down to powder
[1:29:19] amen every part of his life was being
[1:29:22] laid out it was being stripped down
[1:29:25] because god was examining now what's in
[1:29:28] you abraham
[1:29:29] i want to see what's in you
[1:29:32] hallelujah
[1:29:34] and then so now the same thing because
[1:29:36] remember you want to see if you've got
[1:29:38] people under you you want to see their
[1:29:39] qualities
[1:29:40] and you want to develop their qualities
[1:29:42] but not just that you want to help
[1:29:44] improve their weaknesses
[1:29:45] and see if they're good
[1:29:47] you'll get a certain way you want to you
[1:29:49] want to put them in that certain role
[1:29:51] that's leadership
[1:29:53] amen because you want to cultivate your
[1:29:54] staff or whoever's working for you and
[1:29:57] so
[1:29:58] but then you have so but then you have
[1:30:00] to examine them
[1:30:02] and you've got to see really what's in
[1:30:03] them
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:06] and so abraham he was essayed
[1:30:09] he was ground down to powder he was
[1:30:11] examined in this way because god was
[1:30:13] willing to say what's in abraham
[1:30:15] what are the qualities there in abraham
[1:30:18] amen and then so you come along
[1:30:21] and god's put something in you because
[1:30:23] he wants to cultivate what's in you
[1:30:26] and abraham was being cultivated the
[1:30:28] whole time his walk was with god because
[1:30:30] he had to separate he believed god you
[1:30:32] know he had to separate from lord all
[1:30:34] these things had to be separated from
[1:30:36] him
[1:30:37] because what wasn't called abraham was
[1:30:39] called
[1:30:40] amen lot wasn't even part of the promise
[1:30:43] yeah it was it was abraham's promise not
[1:30:45] lot's promise
[1:30:47] and then so all the separation had to be
[1:30:49] taken place
[1:30:50] but then finally when the greatest test
[1:30:52] came
[1:30:53] here's the promise
[1:30:55] now now now kill that promise
[1:30:58] amen are you willing the thing you've
[1:31:00] been praying for are you willing to give
[1:31:02] it up
[1:31:03] are you willing to give it up to follow
[1:31:05] me
[1:31:06] i've been praying about this for so long
[1:31:08] are you going to give it up
[1:31:09] you received it now now now give it back
[1:31:12] and so now it was at that crucial time
[1:31:14] he was being assayed
[1:31:18] and this was done
[1:31:20] this was done to see now what was in
[1:31:22] abraham
[1:31:24] and you have to be able to put yourself
[1:31:26] in that those same shoes
[1:31:28] he was a man that was divinely led
[1:31:31] but now he was a man that was being
[1:31:33] pulled apart and god was examining him
[1:31:36] is there is there faith in there what is
[1:31:39] in him is it gold is it false gold
[1:31:42] is it make-believe is it faith
[1:31:45] amen is it his ambition or is it my word
[1:31:48] in him
[1:31:49] answer he was all laid out like that
[1:31:51] when he was tried and we know the end of
[1:31:53] the story he didn't he didn't he was
[1:31:55] gonna kill isaac but the angel said stop
[1:31:58] but he was going to do it
[1:31:59] because he believed that if god his body
[1:32:02] was dead sarah was all dried up you know
[1:32:04] abraham had sure he had hagar but it
[1:32:06] came down the
[1:32:07] time when they were both made yangi and
[1:32:09] they still couldn't have the child
[1:32:11] because they're still dead in their
[1:32:12] bodies even though they are turned young
[1:32:13] again and then so so he
[1:32:17] he knew if i was dead and i received one
[1:32:20] ass from the dead if i kill him he'll
[1:32:22] come back to life again god will raise
[1:32:23] him up amen
[1:32:25] amen so so he knew that that would
[1:32:26] happen
[1:32:29] so we are here
[1:32:31] divine leadership now
[1:32:35] that will you will be tried
[1:32:38] you will be essayed amen
[1:32:40] amen
[1:32:42] and the reason remember the reason essay
[1:32:44] like rock you don't want all the rock
[1:32:46] you just won the gold
[1:32:48] and the gold maybe maybe this much gold
[1:32:50] i don't know out of tons of
[1:32:52] rock amen and it's the same thing with
[1:32:55] us
[1:32:56] there may be tons of rock that god has
[1:32:58] to move
[1:33:00] to get the gold that's in you out
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:05] if you're being crushed
[1:33:07] god's essaying you
[1:33:09] because he knows he knew what was in
[1:33:10] abraham he wanted to prove it
[1:33:13] you know some geologist can look at a
[1:33:15] mountain range this is what's in this
[1:33:16] rock
[1:33:17] but i'd have to say prove it to me okay
[1:33:19] i'll show you
[1:33:20] and they you know and they're mine
[1:33:22] this is how much he was like brother ian
[1:33:24] senior he said you know they could
[1:33:26] calculate the amount of gold up in peru
[1:33:28] used to be
[1:33:29] you know precious meals they could just
[1:33:31] look at it and you know examine it say
[1:33:33] this is how much is in there they hadn't
[1:33:34] mind anything yet
[1:33:36] they just took some samples and they
[1:33:38] found it
[1:33:39] it's just like god now god can look in
[1:33:41] you
[1:33:42] and he knows what he wants to see
[1:33:44] developed
[1:33:45] he wants your humanity to be get out of
[1:33:47] the way
[1:33:49] just like what we just read there to be
[1:33:51] carnally minded as death
[1:33:53] to be spiritually monitored as life
[1:33:55] because if you're calmly minded you're
[1:33:57] not being led by god
[1:33:59] i mean you're being led by your own
[1:34:01] self amen and your own self won't get
[1:34:03] you where you need to go
[1:34:06] amen but if you're spiritually minded
[1:34:09] then god will lead you the right way
[1:34:11] amen
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:14] so he was essayed
[1:34:16] and so we are essayed because that's
[1:34:19] divine leadership is to not only lead
[1:34:20] you because remember we're not this is
[1:34:22] not some
[1:34:24] you know we're in 2016.
[1:34:27] this could be the last year we're here i
[1:34:28] probably said that last year but i'll
[1:34:29] say it again this year and this is not a
[1:34:32] story of the boy who cried wolf
[1:34:34] or maybe it is but i trust you still
[1:34:36] believe the boy
[1:34:38] amen where's the promise of a body
[1:34:40] change
[1:34:41] this could be the last year we're here
[1:34:44] but we don't want to just take it
[1:34:45] haphazardly
[1:34:47] we don't just want to say well it's
[1:34:49] another year and you know
[1:34:51] because if we're divinely led
[1:34:54] then we have a goal as i said
[1:34:56] but then what are we doing
[1:34:58] what are we doing about that goal
[1:35:00] the scripture tells us
[1:35:03] proverbs 29 18
[1:35:05] where there is no vision that people
[1:35:07] perish
[1:35:08] where there is no vision
[1:35:10] but they could say well we have the
[1:35:11] bible
[1:35:13] but if you have no version what the
[1:35:14] bible is producing then the people will
[1:35:16] perish
[1:35:17] yeah
[1:35:20] and so
[1:35:21] we're to think what are we what are we
[1:35:23] wanting to achieve
[1:35:26] yeah if we're divinely led there's a
[1:35:28] specific thing that we're to achieve
[1:35:31] yep
[1:35:33] because it you know it's not just having
[1:35:35] church on a sunday or a wednesday or
[1:35:37] whenever day we may gather
[1:35:40] that is that is not why we're divinely
[1:35:42] called
[1:35:44] you know what do you want out of this
[1:35:45] year
[1:35:47] what do you want out of when we gather
[1:35:48] what do you you know
[1:35:49] what do you want to do what do you feel
[1:35:51] led to do
[1:35:53] you take it back into the scripture why
[1:35:55] do we you know you know i've been
[1:35:56] thinking about this
[1:35:58] because we you know
[1:35:59] we're at a time
[1:36:01] where life can't just go on
[1:36:04] that's right you understand that life
[1:36:05] can't
[1:36:06] i do not believe i'll have grandchildren
[1:36:08] or even children amen
[1:36:10] amen not not
[1:36:12] you know because i don't believe we have
[1:36:14] that much time left
[1:36:16] i do not believe it for a second and so
[1:36:18] we can't just keep having church
[1:36:21] and then have church and then have camp
[1:36:22] and then have camp and have watched you
[1:36:23] know life is not just going to continue
[1:36:26] on that way
[1:36:27] but then brother abram tells us he says
[1:36:30] it's when he says any any builders
[1:36:33] can can can put down a wall put down a
[1:36:35] stone wall but it takes a master mason
[1:36:38] to actually lay the corner right to turn
[1:36:40] the corner
[1:36:41] and then he said now when jesus came and
[1:36:43] john the baptist was coming i mean mean
[1:36:45] came
[1:36:46] israel was turning a corner
[1:36:48] they are going from law to grace
[1:36:51] they're going from the blood of a lamb
[1:36:53] or a bull or a goat to the blood of thee
[1:36:55] lamb
[1:36:56] amen they'll go from god above them to
[1:36:59] god with them than god in them they're
[1:37:01] turning a tremendous corner i'm sure you
[1:37:02] can agree and it took divine leadership
[1:37:05] now to lead the people around that
[1:37:07] corner
[1:37:09] and and so so they turned a corner and
[1:37:11] then now we're at the end of the church
[1:37:13] ages where god is turning a corner again
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:18] because
[1:37:19] we're under expectation for a change in
[1:37:21] the body
[1:37:22] and we can say we have that expectation
[1:37:24] because the scripture identifies where
[1:37:26] we are
[1:37:27] so there's a change in the body there's
[1:37:29] a rapture then the tribulation and
[1:37:30] there's the millennium that's a corner
[1:37:32] i'm sure you can agree that's a big
[1:37:34] corner
[1:37:36] but it's always at the corner that the
[1:37:38] people stumble
[1:37:40] amen israel stumbled when jesus was
[1:37:42] there he said if he can't believe me
[1:37:44] believe the works that i do for they
[1:37:46] that they are they that testify of me
[1:37:47] amen
[1:37:49] so they couldn't they stumbled at him
[1:37:52] they stumbled here comes the lamb of god
[1:37:54] take away the sin of the world even john
[1:37:56] himself
[1:37:57] identified himself in the scripture
[1:38:01] he he was asked who are you i'm the
[1:38:03] voice of one crying in the wilderness to
[1:38:05] prepare the way of the lord
[1:38:07] he quoted the scripture for them this is
[1:38:09] me
[1:38:10] and they stumbled they stumbled at john
[1:38:13] yeah
[1:38:16] now
[1:38:17] we are not here to stumble and fall
[1:38:21] yeah
[1:38:23] because even even even brother braham
[1:38:25] says the rapture will go because there's
[1:38:27] a secret i come as a thief in the night
[1:38:28] to catch the bride away so people will
[1:38:31] still be having church
[1:38:32] people still think they're getting saved
[1:38:35] you know
[1:38:36] they'll still have meetings now what are
[1:38:37] we going to do for the year in our
[1:38:39] services how are we going to reach this
[1:38:40] country pray for you or whatever they're
[1:38:42] still going to christian
[1:38:45] but the corner has been turned and they
[1:38:46] missed the turning of the corner
[1:38:49] yeah
[1:38:50] because they weren't under the divine
[1:38:52] leadership that came to steer them
[1:38:54] through that corner
[1:38:56] amen
[1:38:58] so
[1:38:59] we are in the process
[1:39:01] you know we have turned a corner
[1:39:04] we have turned a corner this age has
[1:39:06] turned a corner
[1:39:07] and not only has the age turner well how
[1:39:09] do you say the ages turn the corner
[1:39:11] because the prophet's come the word's
[1:39:13] been opened
[1:39:14] christ has been kicked out of his church
[1:39:16] revelations three behold i stand the
[1:39:18] door and knock if any man will open the
[1:39:20] door there's not just a man's heart he's
[1:39:22] talking about the age itself he's
[1:39:23] standing on the outside of the christian
[1:39:25] church that's a big corner term
[1:39:27] once he was in there now he's been
[1:39:29] kicked out
[1:39:30] and so
[1:39:31] you know so this has happened
[1:39:33] but then there's
[1:39:35] you know but then where we are
[1:39:38] now from there down to here
[1:39:40] we have turned a corner
[1:39:42] where once it wasn't once it was a time
[1:39:45] like the book of judges every man did
[1:39:47] what was right in his own eyes
[1:39:50] amen well i believe the message says
[1:39:52] this i believe the bible the message say
[1:39:54] this this is and everyone did what was
[1:39:55] right in their own eyes there's still
[1:39:57] some around but the majority that was a
[1:39:59] time of judges
[1:40:01] but now there's a difference now where
[1:40:03] people are actually coming under the
[1:40:04] divine leadership
[1:40:06] of the word himself
[1:40:08] why'd they have a time of judges
[1:40:11] because they
[1:40:12] led they followed what was right in
[1:40:14] their own eyes they had the word
[1:40:16] amen the angel of the lord was still
[1:40:19] among them
[1:40:21] hey he visited gideon he visited other
[1:40:22] ones in the in the book of judges god
[1:40:25] was still there
[1:40:26] but they were doing they're doing well i
[1:40:28] believe this is how it should be done
[1:40:30] instead of going back to the word and
[1:40:31] saying lord is this right
[1:40:34] those days are over
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:37] those days are over
[1:40:39] they could say well we believe we're
[1:40:41] divinely led because we have look i can
[1:40:43] quote scripture this is what it says i'm
[1:40:45] in the land i'm a real believer
[1:40:49] but they are doing what was right in
[1:40:50] their own eyes
[1:40:52] amen that that phrase is repeated in the
[1:40:54] book of judges over and over again
[1:40:57] but it came to an end
[1:41:00] amen
[1:41:01] when the king came upon the throne you
[1:41:04] say well what about the king now he's
[1:41:05] got to be king in here before he's king
[1:41:07] in the millennium
[1:41:09] and if he's king in here you won't want
[1:41:10] to do what's right in your own eyes
[1:41:14] amen you won't want to do it
[1:41:17] but if he's not king in here you know
[1:41:19] it's like brother joseph
[1:41:20] brought out in the convention of a care
[1:41:22] carry he yeah he brought out a quote how
[1:41:24] do you know you're redeemed you no
[1:41:26] longer want your own will
[1:41:29] that's how you know you're redeemed you
[1:41:30] don't want your own will
[1:41:33] so how do you know you're under divine
[1:41:34] leadership you don't want your own will
[1:41:38] amen but if you want your own will
[1:41:40] then you that must die
[1:41:43] i mean that must lie no bones about it
[1:41:46] you can't be led by two things at once
[1:41:48] you can't please two masters jesus said
[1:41:50] you can't serve god and mammon
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:54] you cannot serve both
[1:41:56] you can be religious and you know you
[1:41:58] can be you can you can serve the world
[1:42:00] and be religious
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:05] yeah but that doesn't mean you're under
[1:42:06] divine leadership
[1:42:10] so now maybe i just wind it up
[1:42:13] so here's yo here's that question
[1:42:16] what are you being led by
[1:42:19] it doesn't matter what situation you're
[1:42:20] going into life that's irrelevant what
[1:42:21] are you being led by
[1:42:24] because the greatest danger david
[1:42:27] david fell at the end of his life
[1:42:30] numbered the people you know no i mean i
[1:42:32] mean even before that bathsheba you know
[1:42:34] saw bathsheba because instead of out
[1:42:36] there fighting with the rest of the
[1:42:37] believers to to take the land he sat
[1:42:40] back in his palace
[1:42:41] he began to lose the vision what he was
[1:42:43] called to do
[1:42:44] yeah
[1:42:46] and people can can come down and they
[1:42:48] can get comfortable in their walk
[1:42:51] and they can say no i just know
[1:42:52] everything everything's just going to be
[1:42:54] rosy
[1:42:55] and that's where the danger comes in
[1:42:58] yeah that's right god told moses told
[1:43:01] the people
[1:43:02] when you come into the land
[1:43:04] and you're blessed and you have all
[1:43:06] these things then you will
[1:43:08] be careful because you'll forget the
[1:43:10] lord in that time
[1:43:13] amen and they did
[1:43:15] they went from divine leadership now
[1:43:18] they've just been led by their own
[1:43:19] selves
[1:43:21] what about you
[1:43:23] yeah you know yo i put this on my lap i
[1:43:25] don't just want to come here and have
[1:43:27] church and just continue on and here we
[1:43:28] are and this is what we do and you know
[1:43:31] i must go beyond that
[1:43:33] amen we're not here forever
[1:43:37] there's a singleness of heart now i
[1:43:40] i've been called under a rapture call
[1:43:42] this is a bright caller's gone out
[1:43:45] hallelujah amen because if you've you
[1:43:47] know if that is anchored in your heart
[1:43:49] if that is anchored in your heart you'll
[1:43:51] be led like abraham was led you'll be
[1:43:54] led paul paul said i wasn't disobedient
[1:43:56] to the heavenly vision now it's not the
[1:43:59] danger is never when the call comes
[1:44:02] you know the challenge can be to keep
[1:44:04] the vision that has been given
[1:44:07] amen because during the walk we can lose
[1:44:10] our vision sometimes
[1:44:12] and people look yo because people get
[1:44:13] motivated they can they can start for
[1:44:15] the kingdom they can get all enthused
[1:44:17] about it but then after a while they
[1:44:19] begin to taper off and cool down because
[1:44:21] they begin to lose the fervency of the
[1:44:23] vision
[1:44:25] amen
[1:44:26] let's not go that way
[1:44:28] amen you gotta i trust when you get up
[1:44:30] in the morning you think this is our
[1:44:32] goal
[1:44:33] honey this is this is why we're raising
[1:44:35] our kids a certain way
[1:44:37] not because we want to be different it's
[1:44:39] not about trying to be different
[1:44:41] it's about
[1:44:42] the family circle will be unbroken on
[1:44:44] that day
[1:44:45] and we know it's god's grace that gets
[1:44:47] us there but we're going to do
[1:44:48] everything in our power
[1:44:50] amen everything in our power to create
[1:44:53] the right ass you know you know create
[1:44:55] the right atmosphere to do the right
[1:44:57] kind of things
[1:44:58] amen that something will happen in our
[1:45:01] children in us they'll take us into a
[1:45:03] higher walk with god
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:06] and that's not being some some fanatic
[1:45:09] paul you know
[1:45:11] all the believers they are fully
[1:45:12] persuaded
[1:45:14] they sold out they were fully persuaded
[1:45:16] they came under divine leadership and
[1:45:18] god led them every step of the way and
[1:45:20] the world thought they were mad
[1:45:23] but who cares
[1:45:24] who cares what the world thinks
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:29] so i trust this coming year
[1:45:32] we'll do things a little differently
[1:45:35] amen
[1:45:36] and my prayer for me this year is i
[1:45:38] don't want to be led by myself
[1:45:40] i don't want to be led by how i feel
[1:45:42] about things or you know
[1:45:44] what i think in it oh it seems to be
[1:45:46] working therefore let's just do it that
[1:45:47] way
[1:45:48] no
[1:45:50] israel thought things were working and
[1:45:51] it was going downhill
[1:45:54] we want to do things according to the
[1:45:55] scripture
[1:45:56] because if you stand on god's word he'll
[1:45:58] stand by you amen amen if you don't
[1:46:01] stand on god's word he's not obligated
[1:46:02] to do anything for you
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:06] so maybe let's just let's just bow heads
[1:46:08] in the wood of prayer
[1:46:11] family want to be remembered or just
[1:46:13] raise your hands i'm going to raise
[1:46:14] raise both my hands
[1:46:16] don't be afraid to trust them
[1:46:18] don't be afraid to trust them
[1:46:20] dear lord jesus
[1:46:22] father i pray you just take this chopped
[1:46:24] up message father may you just buy your
[1:46:27] holy ghost put it all straight lord
[1:46:29] father may recognize that it takes more
[1:46:31] than just being enthused about something
[1:46:33] it takes more than just being excited
[1:46:35] about something but father we need to
[1:46:37] take it back to your word to see if it
