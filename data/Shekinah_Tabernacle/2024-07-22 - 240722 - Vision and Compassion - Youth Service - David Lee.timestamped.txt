[26:41] your seats this afternoon you've got
[26:43] musicians you can take your seats but
[26:44] stay
[26:45] in your seats there
[26:47] praise the lord good to be here this
[26:48] afternoon um
[26:50] i enjoyed the last youth service yes
[26:53] and we actually requested another one
[26:56] so
[26:57] i believe we're in for
[26:59] a continued good time thank you for the
[27:01] songs so far brother josh
[27:03] you're doing really good
[27:05] and
[27:07] for the item it was really good
[27:10] um
[27:11] the bible says in first timothy 4 12 let
[27:14] no man despise thy youth but be thou an
[27:16] example of the believers and word and
[27:18] conversation and charity and spirit and
[27:20] faith and purity
[27:22] and because we're all believers that are
[27:24] taking all of the land we take that land
[27:26] too
[27:27] so none of us despise any of the youth
[27:29] here we think you're all great and
[27:31] and it's always a blessing to us when we
[27:33] hear
[27:34] whether it's a young person or an old
[27:36] person whoever whatever age we get
[27:38] blessed there's a blessing in it also
[27:40] you're in good company all the youth
[27:42] here it feels weird because i feel like
[27:44] kind of a bit of a
[27:47] sir youth um 21 at heart amen
[27:51] um
[27:52] there was a
[27:53] i heard a story a seven-year-old six or
[27:56] seven
[27:57] they asked a month to preach and he got
[27:59] up and preached and it was really
[28:01] anointed you know this the crowd were
[28:03] amending everything was going and he
[28:04] just thought this is the greatest thing
[28:05] so he's preaching his little heart out i
[28:07] think this is a true story
[28:09] pretty sure it is
[28:11] and then um
[28:12] then it was so good that maybe the
[28:13] neighbouring church down the road said
[28:15] oh can we have that little sign so to
[28:16] come preach for us
[28:18] so that was it he was you know starting
[28:20] his preaching sort of journey
[28:22] so he went down to the next place and it
[28:24] didn't quite work as well as the first
[28:25] one you know so it was a bit dry and he
[28:27] sort of just tried to plow his way
[28:29] through but you know
[28:30] came to the end and sort of sat back
[28:31] down then he that night he prayed said
[28:33] lord that's me i'm finished with the
[28:34] ministry
[28:38] but hopefully that's not what we're
[28:40] going to do here
[28:40] [Laughter]
[28:42] um so the first we're going to have
[28:45] brother dave minister to us then um i'll
[28:47] come and we'll sing another song then
[28:48] we'll have brother ben so i believe
[28:50] we're in for a good time i think they
[28:51] have prepared as much as they can
[28:53] you know when you're
[28:55] ministering for the lord it's our duty
[28:56] to prepare as good as we can and then we
[28:58] give the rest of the lord
[28:59] and if we do that hey it's all in the
[29:01] lord's hands you know if we do our part
[29:03] it's not up to man but we can make an
[29:05] effort to say lord this is i want to
[29:06] give you my best
[29:07] and then you do what you want with it if
[29:09] you want to do nothing with it that's
[29:10] fine you want to do something with it
[29:11] it's up to you but and i believe these
[29:13] two brothers have given their best they
[29:14] were in the room praying before they
[29:16] take it seriously
[29:17] so um let's sing the chorus of i'm
[29:20] amazed give me a c as um i'll call up
[29:22] brother dave
[29:24] [Music]

[31:23] jesus christ i'm free
[31:26] amen you guys can all have your seats
[31:29] this afternoon
[31:31] mean i want to talk i want to talk today
[31:33] about um about visions
[31:36] i mean because i you know i've i've been
[31:38] going through some stuff and i thought
[31:39] you know why don't i start sharing
[31:41] a little bit a little bit about visions
[31:43] sorry i find a little bit nervous that
[31:45] kind of doesn't hasn't left
[31:47] um
[31:49] but i looked i looked up on the internet
[31:52] and it's the biblical like the vision a
[31:54] vision means it's just an it's it's
[31:57] imagination you know you have a vision
[31:58] of something you want to do something
[31:59] and you go
[32:00] and you you then do it yeah the biblical
[32:03] meaning at this rate and it says it says
[32:05] visions are scripted efforts to affect
[32:08] change
[32:09] amen so god god will give us a vision
[32:12] and he'll heal them reveal to us you
[32:14] know what we must do but we've already
[32:16] got the god's already given given us the
[32:18] the imagination of what we must go and
[32:20] do and then we must go
[32:23] and do it you know and it's quite it's
[32:26] quite um
[32:27] it's quite powerful so i've
[32:29] i've then gone i've gone to the
[32:30] scriptures if we could turn to acts nine
[32:32] and versus um ten and we'll be reading
[32:36] verses ten through eighteen
[32:38] i mean so acts nine and then
[32:42] 10. um
[32:44] and it says here and there was a certain
[32:46] disciple at the damascus named ananias
[32:50] and to him said the lord in a vision
[32:53] ananias and he said behold i am here
[32:55] lord and the lord said unto him arise
[32:58] and go unto the street which is
[33:01] called straight and inquire in the house
[33:03] of judas for one called saul of tarshish
[33:06] for behold he prays so the lord's giving
[33:09] ananias um
[33:11] a vision
[33:13] and
[33:14] to do something
[33:16] right so he's given he's given him a
[33:18] scripted effort to to go and hit and
[33:22] keep reading
[33:24] and hath seen in a vision a man named
[33:26] ananias coming in and putting his hand
[33:29] on him that he may receive his sight
[33:32] then ananias answered
[33:34] lord i have
[33:36] heard
[33:37] by many of this men
[33:39] how much evil he hath done to thy saints
[33:42] at jerusalem
[33:44] and here he hath authority from the
[33:46] chief priests to bind all that call on
[33:48] my name
[33:49] on thy name
[33:50] but the lord said unto him go thy way
[33:52] for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[33:55] bear my name before the gentiles
[33:59] and kings and the children of israel
[34:01] for i will show him how
[34:04] great things he must suffer for my
[34:06] name's sake and ananiah sent his way
[34:09] and entered into the house
[34:11] and putting his hands on him said
[34:13] brothers saul
[34:15] the lord even jesus that appeared unto
[34:17] thee and the way
[34:19] as thou came camest hath sent me
[34:23] that thou mightest receive thy sight and
[34:26] be filled with the holy ghost and
[34:27] immediately there fell from his eyes as
[34:30] it had been scales
[34:32] and he received his sight forth and
[34:34] arose
[34:35] and was baptized amen so so ananias got
[34:39] a scripted effort and he went and did it
[34:42] and affected change and this this man's
[34:44] and saul who's later taught um name
[34:47] change to paul was filled with the holy
[34:48] ghost so through in a nice um
[34:52] you know god allowed someone to be
[34:53] filled the holy ghost you know i was
[34:55] like man how you know how amazing and
[34:56] then if we can turn to ezekiel eight and
[34:59] four
[35:01] ezekiel eight and four
[35:18] so ezekiel 8 and 4 says
[35:21] and behold the glory of god of israel
[35:24] was there according to the vision that i
[35:27] saw in the plane amen so he was he was
[35:30] there and he'd seen previously in a
[35:31] vision
[35:32] of what had happened so again it's it's
[35:34] basically the same as same as axes gods
[35:37] you know god show him something and he's
[35:38] then seeing it in in the later date um
[35:43] and then i have a quote here from from
[35:44] brother branham
[35:46] it's called the manifestation of the
[35:48] spirit and it says and now after a bit
[35:50] when i got converted
[35:52] it got more than ever
[35:55] it predicted
[35:56] the 1937 flood when hundreds of men
[36:00] stood there
[36:02] and laughed and turned their heads and i
[36:04] predicted 22 feet of water over the
[36:06] streets why i stood there and seen it in
[36:09] a vision i mean so rather than seeing a
[36:10] vision of something happening
[36:13] amen
[36:14] seen a vision of what i've why i stood
[36:16] there and seen in a vision
[36:18] they said the boy's gone crazy i mean so
[36:20] i would have gone to tell some people
[36:21] you know i've seen this vision about
[36:23] this flood and people going you know
[36:24] you're crazy you know same as they did
[36:26] with with brother branham and russia you
[36:27] know they're like you know at the start
[36:29] people are you know it's impossible you
[36:30] know it's not gonna happen and russia's
[36:31] at war you know it's all it's all it's
[36:33] all happening
[36:35] and just a few weeks after that 22 feet
[36:38] of water went over the spring street in
[36:40] jeffersonville indiana see so it
[36:41] actually happened amen so it's
[36:44] how powerful you know
[36:46] amen
[36:48] and then
[36:50] so i want to touch on now outside i was
[36:52] so i'm in my study of visions i was
[36:55] thinking you know who who gets to see
[36:56] visions you know and then um
[36:59] if we if we can all turn to daniel 1
[37:01] and verses 17
[37:17] so daniel 1 verses 17
[37:21] and it says as for these four children
[37:24] god gave them knowledge and skill
[37:27] and all learning of and wisdom and
[37:30] daniel had
[37:31] understanding in all visions and dreams
[37:34] i mean so god's given daniel a gift so
[37:36] god doesn't give everybody this gift he
[37:38] but he's he's saying here he gave he
[37:40] gave this man a gift and
[37:43] and um and understanding
[37:46] in all visions and dreams i mean so
[37:48] daniel daniel alone he's he's now gifted
[37:51] and then if we could go to um
[37:54] if we could go to
[37:56] acts
[37:58] 26
[38:01] and then um
[38:02] acts 26 16.
[38:13] so acts 26 16.
[38:19] and it says here
[38:24] um
[38:26] but rise and stand upon thy feet for i
[38:28] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[38:32] to make thee a minister and a witness
[38:34] both of these things which thou has seen
[38:37] and of those things in which i will
[38:39] appear unto thee delivering thee from
[38:42] the people and from the gentiles
[38:45] unto whom i now now i send thee to open
[38:48] the eyes and to turn them from darkness
[38:51] to light
[38:52] and from the power of satan unto god
[38:55] that they may receive forgiveness of
[38:57] their sins and
[38:59] inheritance
[39:01] among them which are sanctified
[39:03] by faith that
[39:05] is in me were upon o king agrippa i was
[39:08] not disobedient
[39:10] unto the heavenly vision i mean so in
[39:13] our thing of visions there's a heavenly
[39:15] vision
[39:16] amen and then if we could turn to joel 2
[39:19] 28
[39:24] so joel
[39:25] chapter 2 verse 28.
[39:28] that one
[39:51] so joel chapter 2 verse 28 it says and
[39:55] it shall come to pass afterwards that i
[39:57] will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[40:00] and your sons and your daughters shall
[40:02] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[40:05] and you your young men shall see visions
[40:08] amen so i thought i was quite powerful
[40:09] you know stating that you know your old
[40:11] men children dreams and young men shall
[40:14] see visions but i was like you know i'm
[40:17] you know what about the sisters you know
[40:19] they've got no dreams or visions
[40:21] so then i went and i found the um the
[40:22] heavenly vision i'm like actually
[40:24] everyone can see a vision you know we
[40:26] can all see the heavenly vision amen but
[40:28] i was then thinking i was thinking you
[40:30] know every person that that was on earth
[40:32] ever on earth
[40:34] has been a part of this heavenly vision
[40:36] because if
[40:37] if the heavenly vision you know is as
[40:38] god's as as the thought you know of
[40:41] christ his vision of what he wants to
[40:43] accomplish with all of this you know
[40:44] everybody can play a part in it
[40:46] everybody has played a part in it but in
[40:48] order to
[40:50] you know you must live according to the
[40:52] heavenly vision amen which is living
[40:54] you're living your life in truth you
[40:55] know being filled the holy ghost you
[40:56] then have the key to receive the holy
[40:58] ghost but
[41:00] amen
[41:02] but you know don't get disgruntled when
[41:04] it says you know men and young men shall
[41:06] see visions you know because sisters you
[41:07] know you can also see the heavenly
[41:09] vision i mean you can see the vision
[41:10] literally taking part before your eyes
[41:13] amen you don't have to be disgruntled
[41:16] i mean
[41:18] um and then i have i i've have another
[41:21] quote by um by brother branham
[41:24] says
[41:25] i will i was not uh this is the i was
[41:26] not the uh disobedient to the heavenly
[41:29] vision it says here if
[41:31] he's talking about a prayer line
[41:33] if you had to pass through a a line just
[41:36] passing by you'll be healed there just
[41:38] the same as anywhere that is true if
[41:41] your faith is strong enough to throw you
[41:43] throw yourself into the vision
[41:46] it can be for you if not it isn't amen
[41:50] so if you believe you're producing and
[41:51] are going to be and you really want to
[41:53] be filled the holy ghost i mean you will
[41:54] be filled the holy ghost and get saved
[41:57] amen because if you're gives god's given
[41:58] you that faith that can allow you to you
[42:00] know step into being part of the
[42:02] heavenly vision amen and then you can
[42:04] you know you'll be filled the holy ghost
[42:05] i thought man how powerful you know
[42:07] because i often think you know what
[42:08] happens if people get angry at me
[42:10] because you know i've been felt the holy
[42:11] ghost and saved what if they're not you
[42:13] know but i was thinking you know all you
[42:15] have to do is have faith and belief and
[42:16] this will happen to you also so why are
[42:18] you getting frustrated at me for you
[42:20] know you can it's so easy you know god
[42:22] god loves you more than anything you
[42:24] know
[42:25] and all you must always believe and have
[42:28] faith amen
[42:32] and then
[42:33] okay and then and then i was thinking
[42:34] you know what
[42:36] um
[42:37] and then brother brother branham says
[42:39] says here about about a vision um and it
[42:41] shall be even as it was told to me it
[42:44] says now quickly to a vision i told you
[42:46] i would tell you tonight i'll just take
[42:49] about 15 minutes long if possible
[42:52] it happened two years ago
[42:54] i was in my room right after a big
[42:56] meeting and i and i seen a rocky hilly
[42:58] country just as natural i mean so he's
[43:00] having
[43:03] i'm sorry um
[43:05] it's not what you
[43:07] had at now not a dream friend a dream is
[43:10] a dream i mean and i looked on the
[43:12] internet dreams are actually drifts of
[43:14] imagination a vision is as something you
[43:16] see before you it says a vision is
[43:19] something you're looking at like i'm
[43:20] looking right now to you or you're
[43:22] looking at me
[43:24] sometimes i'd be standing right like
[43:26] this i'd sit in my room been sitting in
[43:28] my room talking to my family and move
[43:30] completely away be gone for an hour
[43:33] and half
[43:35] half
[43:36] or two hours and i'd sit perfectly still
[43:38] without a speck of breath that's what
[43:40] medical science can't understand
[43:42] where it done not even a speck of breath
[43:46] you could put
[43:47] a as fine a thing as
[43:50] any you want to around my nose
[43:53] and not a and not a bit of breath
[43:55] they'll tell me but my respirations
[43:57] heartbeats just the same but they don't
[43:59] understand aiming because it wasn't
[44:00] revealed to them however when god
[44:02] reveals us something no we believe the
[44:04] truth
[44:05] amen
[44:06] powerful and then um if we could turn to
[44:08] job 7 14.
[44:12] i mean job 7 14.
[44:19] so job 714 says
[44:22] then they'll scare us me with dreams and
[44:24] terrifies me through visions amen so not
[44:27] every vision is going to be you know
[44:29] wonderful and you know this they they
[44:31] are often you know they might be scary
[44:33] as job stays you know yeah so we don't
[44:36] have scary visions but you know some
[44:38] people might have a scary vision so just
[44:40] warning you no if you start praying dear
[44:41] god give me visions you know you might
[44:43] get a little bit terrified
[44:44] um okay um if then we'll go to job 20
[44:49] and verse 8
[44:53] okay so job 20 and verse 8 he shall fly
[44:56] away as a dream and shall not be found
[44:59] ye he shall be chased away as a vision
[45:02] of the night and when i read this
[45:04] i was like you know a vision of the
[45:06] night you know i need to look into this
[45:08] one and see what it means and then if we
[45:10] go to job 33 and 15
[45:13] so job 33 and 15.
[45:17] it says here in a dream in a vision of
[45:20] the night again he's stating vision of
[45:22] the night when deep sleep falleth upon
[45:24] men and slumberings upon the bed
[45:28] amen so he says sailing again and then
[45:30] if we go to isaiah 29
[45:33] isaiah 29
[45:37] verse 7.
[45:44] so isaiah 29 i've 29.7 says
[45:46] and the multitude
[45:49] of all the nations that fight against
[45:51] ariel
[45:52] even all that fight against her and her
[45:54] munition
[45:56] and that distress her shall be as a
[45:59] dream of a night vision again so he's
[46:00] stating night night vision and i
[46:02] actually um
[46:04] i was like i looked it up on the
[46:06] internet as well
[46:07] because i couldn't i couldn't really
[46:08] find it anywhere else and but it says a
[46:10] night vision is a vision you have half
[46:13] asleep or half awake
[46:15] i mean and brother branham also had um i
[46:18] got a quote from brother branham because
[46:19] i just to try to try to back myself here
[46:22] because the internet you know you can't
[46:23] believe everything it tells you it's
[46:24] full of lies
[46:27] it says and while walking
[46:29] and a few moments ago with brother wood
[46:31] and his arms
[46:32] and his and his uh with his arms around
[46:35] me i was thinking of dear by the wood
[46:38] when i was in
[46:40] uh shrevey port louisiana the lord woke
[46:43] me up one night i mean so the lord's
[46:44] waking him up so i would have been quite
[46:45] tired
[46:46] you know half awake one night and showed
[46:49] me a vision said tell brother would be
[46:51] careful he is going to get hurt amen so
[46:54] quite possibly a night vision but yes so
[46:57] as
[46:58] it's not yeah it's not quite 100 to me
[47:00] yet but
[47:01] i might still have to a little bit of
[47:02] study but
[47:04] that's that's what i got for that one
[47:05] and then if we could go
[47:08] amen um if we could go to x eleven and
[47:11] five
[47:13] so x eleven and five
[47:24] so acts 11 and 5 it says i was in this
[47:27] is um this is peter i was in the city of
[47:30] joppa praying and in a trance i saw a
[47:33] vision i mean so peter's now he's not
[47:35] having a night vision he's not you know
[47:37] he's not half asleep or half awake he's
[47:39] in a trance you know so it's i don't
[47:41] quite know what time it was but he's
[47:43] just he's in some sort of a trance um
[47:46] but i suppose when you have a night
[47:47] vision you'll kind of be no sitting down
[47:49] or he may have been standing up you know
[47:50] like yeah
[47:52] so um
[47:54] i saw a vision a certain vessel
[47:57] descended as it had been a great sheet
[48:00] letting down
[48:02] let down from heaven by four corners and
[48:05] it came even to me
[48:08] amen and then if we could go
[48:09] to x
[48:11] 10 so we turn back to x 10
[48:14] and then we will read
[48:17] from nine
[48:19] and it says here on the morrow as they
[48:21] went on their journey
[48:23] and drew nigh unto the city peter went
[48:25] up upon the housetop to pray about the
[48:28] sixth hour
[48:30] and he became very hungry
[48:32] and would have eaten but while they made
[48:34] ready he fell into a trance i mean so
[48:36] he's having another another trance
[48:38] amen and then
[48:41] um it was 11 and saw heaven opened and a
[48:45] certain vessel descending upon unto him
[48:47] as it had been a great sheep knit at the
[48:51] four corners
[48:52] and let down to the earth amen and then
[48:55] if we go to verses
[48:57] quick to verse 17 now while peter
[48:59] doubted in himself what this vision
[49:02] which
[49:03] he had seen should mean behold the men
[49:05] which were sent from cornelius had made
[49:09] inquiry for for simon's house
[49:12] and stood before the gate amen so was
[49:15] like i was thinking about that i was
[49:16] like man so peter peter and you know his
[49:18] his own being you know being just like
[49:20] one of us you know is doubting i mean
[49:22] says you know if we you know if we see a
[49:24] vision or something you know we it
[49:26] you know it's all right you know some we
[49:29] do doubt i mean i mean we are human we
[49:31] do make make mistakes i mean we do we do
[49:33] doubt but then it says and
[49:36] the men which were sent from cornelius
[49:38] had made inquiry for simon's house and
[49:41] stood before the gate amen so if peter
[49:43] didn't doubt if if god didn't place that
[49:45] down on peter he might have left and he
[49:47] might have you know miss cornelius i
[49:49] remember unfortunately because you know
[49:50] peter's a human god used that amen and
[49:53] now and now you know god's god's making
[49:56] making another plan amen i just i found
[49:59] that quite powerful but then i was also
[50:01] thinking i was like man you know what
[50:02] what happens what happens if we if we
[50:04] start doubting you know in our vision
[50:07] and then if we could turn to isaiah 40
[50:10] so isaiah 40 and go verse
[50:13] 30.
[50:14] what's this
[50:26] so sorry isaiah 40.
[50:42] so i'm gonna have to sing that um the
[50:44] children's song that shows has all the
[50:45] um the books of the bible sister brown
[50:48] actually taught it to me but because i
[50:49] was
[50:50] but um i forgot so
[50:53] i have to re-learn that one um
[50:57] and then if we go verse 30 it says even
[50:58] the youths
[51:00] shall faint and be weary
[51:02] and the young men shall utterly fall i
[51:04] mean so
[51:06] and
[51:07] what i was thinking i was like even
[51:09] though you shall faint and be weary and
[51:10] the young men childly force i mean
[51:11] that's a little bit like um
[51:14] you know peter peter in their place you
[51:15] know kind of he he got a little bit
[51:17] faint start doubting amen
[51:19] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[51:21] renew their strength they shall mount up
[51:23] with wings as eagles they shall run and
[51:25] not be weary they shall walk and not
[51:27] faint i mean so all we have to do we
[51:28] start downing is just wait upon the lord
[51:30] and he will reveal his word amen because
[51:33] that you know is a great great god
[51:34] almighty amen but i i hope you guys were

[55:38] see people overcome and receive eternal
[55:40] life
[55:41] that this is the lord's work and uh i

[55:45] get behind the pulpit neither will i
[55:46] know it's like you're speaking to
[55:49] someone very special special like this
[55:51] is god's special people
[55:52] it's like um you can just say i'm just
[55:54] gonna say a prayer
[55:57] lord jesus lord just want to thank you
[55:58] lord for the opportunity to minister my
[56:00] god just
[56:01] as the word comes out i pray just i'm a
[56:03] vessel to you lord you can just use me
[56:05] and speak through me lord we're so
[56:07] thankful lord to be in your house on the
[56:08] sunday lord with our brothers and
[56:09] sisters who are also happy to be here
[56:11] god
[56:12] lord we just pray you just teach us how
[56:14] to use your sword lord and reveal your
[56:16] word to us my god and just
[56:17] become so personal to us lord jesus amen
[56:21] so i've got a little thought today and
[56:23] my thought is about compassion
[56:25] um can the compassion has the human know
[56:28] it and compassion as god no i think a
[56:30] little bit different
[56:32] um it was doing a little journey but i
[56:34] want to start with matthew chapter 11 28
[56:36] amen
[56:38] the scripture says
[56:40] come unto me all ye that are all that
[56:44] labor and are heavy laden i will give
[56:45] you rest
[56:47] and
[56:49] i think this scripture has a you if you
[56:52] read it it has a lot of it
[56:54] has compassion in it what the words are
[56:56] compassion that's that's what i read
[56:59] come to come to me and he'll give you
[57:00] rest when you when people come out of
[57:02] the world
[57:03] when they don't have the holy ghost when
[57:05] they come to christ
[57:07] they and when they get that research in
[57:08] life that is compassion
[57:10] god came down and he died for us
[57:14] because he had compassion he didn't want
[57:15] to do away with us he had compassion me
[57:17] and my state when i was in the world
[57:19] full of idolatry and sinning and
[57:20] drunkenness and no happiness like as
[57:23] eternally separated from god at that
[57:24] point he had compassion he died on the
[57:26] cross for me and that's the compassion
[57:29] he's given to us but there's many times
[57:31] in the bible he came to people and he
[57:32] walked past blind malted people cripples
[57:36] and he didn't heal them he went to one
[57:37] and he killed them so if you've had that
[57:39] compassion understand that god is very
[57:41] compassionate to you and you're very
[57:42] blessed and you need to
[57:44] you need to show that compassion to
[57:45] people everywhere you go
[57:47] and the bible is the bible is full of it
[57:49] and it's just it's pretty much having
[57:50] the same mind as christ too that
[57:52] compassion is a great attribute god have
[57:54] and he wants us to have that and show it
[57:56] to people also
[58:04] this is not just for the old people this
[58:05] is for the young people we're all young
[58:06] here young in christ
[58:09] and we all want to be we all want to we
[58:10] all want to be a vessel for the word and
[58:12] of the lord
[58:15] we want to be willing to surrender just
[58:16] like jesus did he his compassion was so
[58:19] great like
[58:20] this is nothing new to you guys i know
[58:22] you all know but he didn't he didn't
[58:23] have a wife he didn't have a house he
[58:25] didn't have a job description we got
[58:26] paid money like me and you do he didn't
[58:28] have that and it was he did this all for
[58:31] compassion because he didn't want to see
[58:32] his
[58:33] the greatest creation for sin because of
[58:36] the devil's trickery and how he he came
[58:38] against us he warned against us to trick
[58:40] us that's the devil's trick was to
[58:43] to anoint the word to anoint the devil's
[58:45] word to make us unbelievably anointed
[58:47] unbelief through the serpent made us
[58:49] full but the lord had compassion to
[58:51] bring us out of that and
[58:52] he wants us to take on his mind to be
[58:54] able to see the devil's trick in this
[58:55] day and move forward and overcome
[58:57] because the devil always comes with the
[58:59] same tricks in your mind there will be
[59:01] one bit of doubt on the word of god and
[59:03] that will make you
[59:05] fall away from god it's that one thing
[59:06] in the mind we need to have the same
[59:07] mind of christ the devil will always
[59:09] attack us in the mind and if he gets in
[59:10] the mind he just sits backs and laughs
[59:13] he just that's what he does
[59:15] and the lord is very gracious to
[59:17] to
[59:18] give us grace and teach us and use us
[59:21] and keep extending us grace and keep
[59:23] teaching us how to use a sword to cut
[59:24] through
[59:25] each demon as they come because there's
[59:27] a legion of them trying to attack us in
[59:28] this day and it's only through his grace
[59:30] and compassion that he teaches us to
[59:32] overcome
[59:34] i want to um there's
[59:38] so the
[59:40] english meaning of compassion is the
[59:42] meaning of compassion is to recognize
[59:44] the suffering of others and then take
[59:46] action to help
[59:48] compassion is more than a feeling
[59:49] concerned about someone in the stress or
[59:51] caring about
[59:53] a person's misfortune
[59:56] compassion is a feeling of sympathy or
[59:57] pity for others
[59:59] but like especially it makes you help
[1:00:01] them it's not just a feeling you don't
[1:00:02] go
[1:00:03] they're hurting it makes you actually go
[1:00:04] and help that person that's hurting and
[1:00:07] you go to them help them not just oh a
[1:00:10] couple of days they're hurting they'll
[1:00:11] be right you know the lord didn't when
[1:00:13] he seen me
[1:00:15] in my backs in the stage
[1:00:17] in agony and depressed and worth nothing
[1:00:20] he didn't go oh the devil's done that
[1:00:22] too bad he had compassion he died for me
[1:00:23] like his blood was for me
[1:00:29] he made a way he didn't want him without
[1:00:31] us and i'm so thankful because
[1:00:33] i know where i was and i know where i am
[1:00:34] now and it's very powerful and i'm
[1:00:37] when when i see i'll use brother davis
[1:00:39] example when i see dave went out to the
[1:00:40] world he had compassion on him and
[1:00:42] brought him back and it's real powerful
[1:00:44] because i know he's our brother you know
[1:00:46] and
[1:00:46] anyone in our church if we see them full
[1:00:49] we should have compassion on them
[1:00:51] oh i don't want to hear myself i wish we
[1:00:53] should go into fasting and praying we
[1:00:55] should go see them we should go help
[1:00:57] them out and assist them because that's
[1:00:58] what god did for us and for us not to do
[1:01:00] that is not to have the mind of christ
[1:01:02] we
[1:01:02] it might not be to go do everything for
[1:01:04] that person because the lord is bringing
[1:01:06] them through something but definitely
[1:01:07] pray for them battle through and win
[1:01:09] through prayerf because that's what
[1:01:10] christ did for each and every each of us
[1:01:15] i want to um
[1:01:18] it's a fantastic battle you know it's
[1:01:21] rigged i've been to this rig because we
[1:01:22] win you know
[1:01:26] it's great it's great i nev i don't like
[1:01:27] losing anyway
[1:01:29] i want to read jude
[1:01:32] i want to read jude
[1:01:34] 19-22
[1:01:38] i think
[1:01:49] these be though who separated themselves
[1:01:51] sensual having not the spirit but ye
[1:01:54] beloved building up yourself on the most
[1:01:57] on your most holy faith
[1:01:59] praying in the holy ghost keeping
[1:02:00] yourselves and the love of god looking
[1:02:04] a love of god looking for the mercy of
[1:02:06] our lord jesus christ unto unto eternal
[1:02:09] life
[1:02:10] and of some have compassion making a
[1:02:12] difference
[1:02:16] jude to me is a little it's a little
[1:02:18] it's a something in the scripture but
[1:02:19] he's really talking to the bride
[1:02:21] he's talking to his purchase
[1:02:24] and he's saying he's saying pray through
[1:02:25] the pray pray in the holy ghost keep the
[1:02:27] love of god in the mercies of the lord
[1:02:29] jesus christ until eternal life your
[1:02:30] whole life and
[1:02:32] and in the end the scripture stuck out
[1:02:33] to me when i was um studying it because
[1:02:36] he said end of some
[1:02:38] have compassion
[1:02:40] making a difference
[1:02:42] brother andy was saying to me a while
[1:02:43] ago you know you've got loved ones and
[1:02:45] family friends around the world and you
[1:02:47] want to come and receive christ
[1:02:49] and he said you know how are you how are
[1:02:51] you going to get them to do that you can
[1:02:52] you can say what you want
[1:02:54] that can help but
[1:02:56] really praying for them having
[1:02:58] compassion praying like you know
[1:03:00] spending two hours a night praying for
[1:03:01] that person to receive their eyes be
[1:03:03] open that's for me that's having
[1:03:04] compassion that's surrendering your
[1:03:06] sleep time you're what you want to do
[1:03:08] your hobbies your interests and really
[1:03:09] praying through that for that person and
[1:03:12] if it's a burden of the lord if it's a
[1:03:13] person the lord has put in your heart
[1:03:15] and there's a burden for him that
[1:03:16] compression the bible says it makes a
[1:03:19] difference it will make a difference in
[1:03:20] their life they will help or they will
[1:03:22] overcome they will have happiness and
[1:03:24] joy and they won't know why but they
[1:03:26] will be because you're praying for them
[1:03:27] it'll be the love of god expressed to
[1:03:29] them
[1:03:32] we have to have compassion for this
[1:03:33] dying world we we were once all part of
[1:03:35] it before the lord pulled us out
[1:03:44] and the same with that entering into our
[1:03:45] brothers burdens with compassion wanting
[1:03:47] to help our brothers
[1:03:49] winning through prayer our brothers and
[1:03:50] sisters not in the world but in the
[1:03:52] church too you know if people are
[1:03:53] struggling i don't want to jump ahead
[1:03:56] but praying
[1:03:57] praying for them
[1:03:58] entering into their burdens with
[1:04:00] compassion because that's it's a
[1:04:01] compassion that christ said through us
[1:04:03] will make the difference for them
[1:04:08] i want to go to chapter peter chapter 2
[1:04:11] our second peter
[1:04:13] chapter three eight to nine
[1:04:21] oh man
[1:04:37] yeah it sort of seems like some of this
[1:04:38] was a continuation of my first sermon on
[1:04:41] the mind
[1:04:43] being fully sold out to christ in your
[1:04:44] mind not letting the devil attack you
[1:04:45] there
[1:04:47] finally brethren ye o
[1:04:49] finally be ye all of one mind having
[1:04:52] compassion one to another love as
[1:04:54] brethren be pitiful and
[1:04:56] is that
[1:04:57] courtesy
[1:04:59] see how you spell it
[1:05:00] say it
[1:05:01] courteous
[1:05:03] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[1:05:06] for railing but contra wise blessing
[1:05:08] knowing that ye
[1:05:10] are the who that ye are
[1:05:13] there
[1:05:16] sorry not rendering evil for evil or
[1:05:19] rallying for railing but contra wise
[1:05:21] blessing knowing that g are
[1:05:24] there
[1:05:25] unto called
[1:05:27] say well your bible says that ye
[1:05:29] shouldn't hear it a blessing
[1:05:32] i don't i'm sorry that this is what my
[1:05:34] bible said didn't make sense that word
[1:05:35] anyway but i'm sure it does
[1:05:41] at the end of the city that you
[1:05:42] shouldn't hear to hear and hear it or
[1:05:44] blessing not rendering evil for evil or
[1:05:45] writing for railing you know when
[1:05:46] someone does your best i'd rather either
[1:05:47] say if someone does your bad just if
[1:05:49] you've had a bad deal just it's all good
[1:05:52] you know there's a blessing in it for
[1:05:53] you humble yourself and serve your
[1:05:55] brother serve your brethren be like
[1:05:57] christ that he didn't
[1:05:59] he doesn't fight if someone hits him he
[1:06:00] doesn't hit them back he just forgives
[1:06:02] he moves on
[1:06:03] and it's hard but
[1:06:05] surrender
[1:06:06] surrender just like christ did and have
[1:06:08] compassion for them because if that if
[1:06:10] they're truly ripping you off or doing
[1:06:12] dirty to you there's a spirit on them
[1:06:14] that will take them to hell and if they
[1:06:15] can never see someone with christ in
[1:06:17] them show them compassion that spirit
[1:06:19] will take them to hell because i'll
[1:06:20] never see they'll just this is how they
[1:06:22] are and this is people when i genuinely
[1:06:24] they they try attacking back when
[1:06:26] someone doesn't i'll be like when that
[1:06:28] person blesses them back like the lord
[1:06:30] says they'll they'll think and go oh
[1:06:32] what what's going this is not normal why
[1:06:34] would he love me back when i'm when i'm
[1:06:36] ripping him off or doing him wrong or
[1:06:38] hitting him or hurting him or taking
[1:06:39] from his family
[1:06:45] the the christian walkers is a suff it's
[1:06:48] to suffer with the lord he suffered for
[1:06:50] us
[1:06:50] the greek meaning of compassion is to
[1:06:53] uh
[1:06:56] to suffer with
[1:06:58] and in this life we are suffering with
[1:07:00] the lord
[1:07:01] we make sacrifices and we suffer with
[1:07:04] the lord but it's a great suffering i
[1:07:06] i enjoy it sometimes sometimes it's a
[1:07:08] bit harder
[1:07:17] um
[1:07:18] especially to the young kids i just want
[1:07:20] to
[1:07:21] i've seen a little bit already but
[1:07:23] close close your ears and your eyes and
[1:07:24] your mind to the devil
[1:07:26] jesus overcome the devil and just he
[1:07:28] said it is written
[1:07:29] it is written that's how he overcame he
[1:07:31] didn't let the devil's lies enter into
[1:07:32] his mind he didn't give the devil time
[1:07:34] he didn't pay attention to his nonsense
[1:07:36] he just moved forward
[1:07:38] and said it is written and we know the
[1:07:39] bible has given us many ways to overcome
[1:07:43] compassion is one of them loving your
[1:07:45] neighbor is one of them but it is
[1:07:46] written don't don't let the devil's lies
[1:07:49] and
[1:07:50] and all the things of this world occupy
[1:07:52] your mind put your mind and your time on
[1:07:54] christ
[1:07:55] that's that's when you will start to be
[1:07:57] blessed and you'll be able to move
[1:07:59] forward in your walk with the lord
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:04] i want to turn to luke 10 27.
[1:08:22] so lawyer came to tempt him in the story
[1:08:24] and then he said unto them
[1:08:27] and he answered
[1:08:30] and he said answering thou shalt love
[1:08:32] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[1:08:34] all thy heart with all thy soul with all
[1:08:36] thy strength and with all thy mind
[1:08:39] and our neighbor as thyself
[1:08:43] then you know then your neighbor can see
[1:08:44] christ you know in somebody it's very
[1:08:47] important you know sometimes we we
[1:08:50] we fight many battles in this life and
[1:08:52] if we just keep our mind our heart our
[1:08:54] strength and our soul all on christ
[1:08:56] everything sold out to christ a lot of
[1:08:58] the battles we came and faced we would
[1:09:00] have really been equipped although we
[1:09:03] are humans who make mistakes and stumble
[1:09:05] but if we had been a little bit more
[1:09:07] sincere a little bit more
[1:09:08] studying in the world we would have
[1:09:10] known the battles that were coming and
[1:09:11] we would have already had the sword of
[1:09:13] the word in our hand ready to overcome
[1:09:16] don't be slothful in this light hour it
[1:09:18] is dark out there
[1:09:20] take on the mind of christ
[1:09:22] put him forced in everything and he'll
[1:09:24] fight your battles but if you don't take
[1:09:26] on the minor christ if you don't put him
[1:09:27] first there will be battle scars it will
[1:09:30] hurt it will hold you back your family
[1:09:32] back anybody that's around you would be
[1:09:33] affected if you're if you're walking
[1:09:35] around like this oh
[1:09:36] if you're walking like this you'll get
[1:09:38] attacked and the people around you will
[1:09:39] also
[1:09:40] you know it will affect them too because
[1:09:42] who you hang around is what you become
[1:09:44] like
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:51] i'm not sure if this one was very
[1:09:52] fitting but i'm going to say it i felt
[1:09:54] led to galatians
[1:09:55] 3 10
[1:09:57] to turn away
[1:09:58] from god's compassion is eternal death
[1:10:02] god's compassion is eternal life without
[1:10:04] god's compassion without him dying on
[1:10:06] the cross
[1:10:07] it would be death we wouldn't there
[1:10:08] would be no way to access god so
[1:10:10] compassion for god is
[1:10:12] eternal love
[1:10:17] um
[1:10:27] galatians 3 10.
[1:10:32] for as many as ye are of
[1:10:34] the works of the law
[1:10:39] for as many as
[1:10:40] are of the works of the law are under
[1:10:42] the curse that is written curses is
[1:10:45] everyone that continueth not on all
[1:10:47] things which are written in the book of
[1:10:49] the law to do unto them now we know
[1:10:50] we're under grace but this is still a
[1:10:53] book of law without the blood it's law
[1:10:55] but we've got grace but it he plainly
[1:10:57] says that you're cursed
[1:10:59] if you're if you don't if you care if
[1:11:01] you carry on and follow in the world
[1:11:02] you're cursed to do not to do with the
[1:11:04] things of the lord
[1:11:06] and to reject the lord's word you're
[1:11:08] cursed
[1:11:09] don't do that give all give everything
[1:11:11] to the lord whether you stumble and fall
[1:11:14] whether you make mistakes just run back
[1:11:15] to the lord tell them all about it he'll
[1:11:16] help you
[1:11:17] even if it's addictions
[1:11:19] if it's hurt if it scars from when
[1:11:21] you're a kid and how you react
[1:11:24] the lord will help you overcome that if
[1:11:25] you run to him and tell him about it you
[1:11:27] know
[1:11:28] some of my childhood things you know i
[1:11:29] reacted with anger out of fear and
[1:11:31] because of past hurts and emotions and
[1:11:33] that's how you react you react and you
[1:11:35] react but the lord doesn't want you to
[1:11:36] react like that give that to the lord he
[1:11:38] will you might you might cry to the lord
[1:11:40] about your anger or about your
[1:11:41] frustration or about how you are as a
[1:11:43] person or react to situations because of
[1:11:45] how
[1:11:46] you were brought up in the people around
[1:11:48] you that made your life what it was but
[1:11:50] the lord will take that from you but if
[1:11:51] you don't run to the lord and tell them
[1:11:53] about that and you don't do what god has
[1:11:54] told you to do
[1:11:56] it it won't get any better you you won't
[1:11:58] get help the lord is our help he's our
[1:12:00] strong tower in our refuge
[1:12:06] i want to turn to romans
[1:12:09] 9 and 15.
[1:12:23] i was saying start from verse 14 what
[1:12:25] shall we say then
[1:12:27] is there unrighteous with god god
[1:12:30] forbid for he saith to moses i will have
[1:12:32] mercy on whom i will have mercy and i
[1:12:34] will have compassion on whom i will have
[1:12:36] compassion
[1:12:40] it's pretty powerful
[1:12:42] that he does have mercy on whom he has
[1:12:45] mercy on his compassion who is
[1:12:46] compassion the bride has lots of mercy
[1:12:49] grace and compassion accents to them and
[1:12:52] if
[1:12:53] if god's revealing your bride
[1:12:55] your your mercy and compassion can go
[1:12:57] out to others too because you hold a
[1:12:58] very powerful
[1:13:00] place with the lord
[1:13:02] with the word
[1:13:06] it's it's a that's a great
[1:13:08] it's such a great thing to know your
[1:13:10] compassion will help and change other
[1:13:12] people's lives
[1:13:14] it's not the lord gave his bride power
[1:13:18] he gave him the word the sword the lord
[1:13:20] is with us
[1:13:22] the lord cared he didn't want in he
[1:13:23] didn't come to
[1:13:25] he came that everybody would come but
[1:13:27] he's chosen
[1:13:29] but our compassion can still change
[1:13:31] lives our prayers can change lives
[1:13:34] i want to turn to luke
[1:13:37] 15 20.
[1:13:55] when he rose he came
[1:13:58] and he rose and came to his father but
[1:14:00] when he was yet a great way off his
[1:14:02] father saw him and his compassion ran
[1:14:04] and fell on his knees and kissed him
[1:14:08] now if i
[1:14:10] remember
[1:14:11] rightly this is a this is the one of the
[1:14:13] prodigal sons he was hungry and he came
[1:14:14] home
[1:14:15] and he he you know his inheritance he
[1:14:18] had spoiled he had
[1:14:19] he had turned from god he'd turned from
[1:14:21] his father's will we've done everything
[1:14:22] wrong and when he came home his father
[1:14:24] ran out to meet him he didn't make him
[1:14:26] big or grovel the lord doesn't make us
[1:14:27] big or go he he runs out to us and he
[1:14:30] gives us his best robe he puts his blood
[1:14:32] on us he washes us from sins and
[1:14:33] cleanses us makes us to his own image
[1:14:36] and that's what the lord's doing right
[1:14:37] today he has compassion on us
[1:14:43] i'm so glad that with his compassion
[1:14:44] comes the land
[1:14:46] comes healing comes faith comes
[1:14:49] overcoming power of all spiritual
[1:14:50] wickedness
[1:14:52] you can claim your family it's not just
[1:14:54] some small promises everything is ours
[1:14:57] we do need to possess the land that we
[1:14:59] are in the rapture cycle that's the
[1:15:00] point of time we are the prophet has
[1:15:01] come with the message
[1:15:03] we are moving forward it's the
[1:15:08] truth want to turn to mark 141
[1:15:21] a lot of these scripts are just
[1:15:24] um
[1:15:26] times throughout the bible
[1:15:28] where he speaks of compassion and how it
[1:15:30] was extended and what the people have
[1:15:32] done around them
[1:15:33] like like the son who had gone out and
[1:15:36] when he came home how the father reacted
[1:15:37] he didn't
[1:15:38] he didn't scorn him
[1:15:40] he didn't put him down he welcomed him
[1:15:43] and
[1:15:45] i'm so glad jesus welcomes us you know
[1:15:46] through all of our shortcomings when we
[1:15:49] do wrong he welcomes us home
[1:16:05] i was going to read
[1:16:06] from actually 39 and he preached in the
[1:16:08] synagogues throughout all galilee and
[1:16:10] casted devils and they came a leper to
[1:16:12] him beseeching him and kneeling down to
[1:16:13] him and saying unto him if thou wilt
[1:16:16] thou canist make me clean and jesus move
[1:16:18] with compassion put forth his hand
[1:16:20] and touched him and said unto him
[1:16:23] i will be thou clean as soon as he had
[1:16:26] spoken immediately the leprosy departed
[1:16:28] from him he was cleaned and he was
[1:16:30] straightly charged and he strongly
[1:16:32] charged him
[1:16:33] and went for
[1:16:34] and sent him away
[1:16:36] and he said unto him
[1:16:38] see thou say nothing to
[1:16:40] any man but go thy way show thyself to
[1:16:43] the priest and offer for cleansing those
[1:16:46] things which moses commanded for a
[1:16:48] testimony unto them
[1:16:50] and i want to jump over to mark
[1:16:53] 5 19.
[1:16:55] i don't know why he didn't say to tell
[1:16:57] anybody in that scripture but over in 5
[1:16:59] 19 if i've got the right one
[1:17:06] however jesus suffered him not but unto
[1:17:08] him go home tell thy friends
[1:17:11] and tell them how great
[1:17:13] things the lord have done for thee and
[1:17:15] here compassion on thee
[1:17:28] this is the story
[1:17:31] with the man that had the legion of
[1:17:32] demons
[1:17:33] and he hate compassion but the lord said
[1:17:38] the lord had compassion i'm sorry i'm
[1:17:39] getting ahead of myself
[1:17:47] i thought sorry i thought that was a
[1:17:48] story where he told him to go tell how
[1:17:50] the lord had compassion
[1:17:55] that's right i want to turn over to mark
[1:17:56] 9. 22.
[1:18:10] jesus before in 21 just asked how long
[1:18:14] since
[1:18:15] this happened to the child 22 in off
[1:18:17] times
[1:18:18] it hath cast him into the fire and into
[1:18:21] the waters to destroy him
[1:18:23] this is talking of evil spirit on the
[1:18:25] boy but if the arcanist do anything have
[1:18:27] compassion on us and help so this dude's
[1:18:29] asking for compassion and jesus said
[1:18:31] unto him if thou cannot believe all
[1:18:33] things are possible to him they
[1:18:34] believeth we're all believers here so
[1:18:36] all things are possible it's fantastic
[1:18:39] and straight away the father of the
[1:18:41] child cried out and said with tears lord
[1:18:43] help me help thou my unbelief
[1:18:46] and when jesus saw the people
[1:18:49] saw that the people came running
[1:18:50] together he rebuked the foul spirit
[1:18:52] saying to them thou dumb and death
[1:18:54] spirit i charge thee come out of him and
[1:18:56] enter into him no more
[1:18:58] so
[1:18:59] this stood out to me because
[1:19:01] he didn't just charge him and cast me he
[1:19:03] said enter into him no more
[1:19:05] he gave he he
[1:19:07] commanded that demonic spirit
[1:19:09] no more you will go into this person
[1:19:17] i wanna um
[1:19:22] touch uh
[1:19:30] i want to carry on down here
[1:19:32] with this particular spirit
[1:19:38] he he said he told him not to go go and
[1:19:40] i'm sorry i should just keep reading so
[1:19:42] i'll just keep reading
[1:19:44] and the spirit cried and rented him saw
[1:19:46] and came unto him and
[1:19:48] he was as one that was dead and so much
[1:19:50] that many said he is dead when the
[1:19:52] spirit had left him and jesus took him
[1:19:53] by the hand and lifted him up and he
[1:19:55] arose and when he was come into the
[1:19:57] house his disciples asked him privately
[1:20:00] why would we not cast them out because
[1:20:02] they couldn't they couldn't cast me even
[1:20:03] though
[1:20:04] over in
[1:20:06] luke 9 1 jesus had already given
[1:20:08] power for him to cast all devils and
[1:20:10] diseases the spirit wouldn't leave and i
[1:20:12] asked lord why why could we not cast
[1:20:14] this this
[1:20:15] specific demon out
[1:20:17] and i asked him privately about this and
[1:20:18] he said unto them this kind can come
[1:20:20] forth by nothing but by fasting and
[1:20:22] praying
[1:20:23] and
[1:20:25] this is what i wanted to get to
[1:20:27] in the sermon
[1:20:28] but because i believe there's some keys
[1:20:30] in here for us that really help us
[1:20:31] overcome
[1:20:33] the lord had compassion on this person
[1:20:35] the
[1:20:36] the son's dad had compassion and brought
[1:20:38] him to be healed jesus had compassion on
[1:20:39] that person and when he had rebuked the
[1:20:42] spirit he said enter no more so he he
[1:20:45] gave he he sent an authority over the
[1:20:47] demons but he said no more and then and
[1:20:49] then the disciples were like okay so no
[1:20:51] more he can't but then they went to him
[1:20:53] and said why couldn't we do it and he
[1:20:55] said because you're not fasting and
[1:20:56] praying this forth will not come forth
[1:20:58] by passing and praying and when you fast
[1:21:00] in prayer you're having an intimate
[1:21:03] relationship with the lord jesus and if
[1:21:06] you're praying for someone that has
[1:21:07] spirits on them you're showing
[1:21:09] compassion on them and that is as you're
[1:21:11] surrendering your life
[1:21:14] part of your time
[1:21:16] to intercede for that person to help
[1:21:17] them overcome and i think it's very
[1:21:19] important when we're praying for people
[1:21:20] if they're going through something in
[1:21:21] our church or our friends our family to
[1:21:23] fast and pray for them to help them
[1:21:25] overcome to have compassion because the
[1:21:27] spirits in this day and age are all
[1:21:29] linking together
[1:21:30] fortifying so we can't
[1:21:33] so we can't remove them you know so we
[1:21:34] don't have anointed sons of god serving
[1:21:37] the lord
[1:21:44] i just want to read a description of
[1:21:45] brother ben and quotes john 5
[1:21:48] 19.
[1:21:56] then jesus answered said unto them
[1:21:57] verily verily i say unto you the son can
[1:21:59] do nothing of himself but will he see
[1:22:01] the father do it do
[1:22:04] for what things so ever he doeth these
[1:22:07] also do with the sun likewise amen
[1:22:13] it's um it's good it's good that we see
[1:22:16] that
[1:22:16] the father faster than jesus faster than
[1:22:19] pray to the fat the father
[1:22:21] as you know so we can see to do that too
[1:22:23] if we see someone struggling we can
[1:22:24] enter into their burden and have
[1:22:25] compassion and we can overcome stronger
[1:22:29] demonic spirits that are battling with
[1:22:30] our children or our families our lost
[1:22:32] ones to help them overcome that's right
[1:22:35] brother branham showed so much
[1:22:36] compassion
[1:22:41] this is speak to the rock
[1:22:43] how do you do sir do you believe me to
[1:22:45] be a prophet our lord is the same
[1:22:47] yesterday today and forever he's always
[1:22:49] full of full of mercy and compassion for
[1:22:51] those who believe on his name
[1:22:54] i trust that you do sir
[1:22:58] this man had a blood disease
[1:23:00] but this thing stuck out to me because
[1:23:02] he said
[1:23:03] he's always full of compassion for those
[1:23:05] who believe on his name you know when
[1:23:07] jesus
[1:23:09] died
[1:23:10] he had compassion for his lost seed and
[1:23:13] his compassion was lost seed he didn't
[1:23:15] necessarily have compassion for
[1:23:18] serpent seed for the people that
[1:23:20] actually aren't saved i don't have a
[1:23:21] place in the book of eternal life he
[1:23:22] didn't have compassion to them that's
[1:23:24] why he went through the uh the the
[1:23:26] waters to stir up the waters you know
[1:23:27] the angel said the waters once a year
[1:23:29] when he went through
[1:23:31] he went through lots of blind and hot
[1:23:33] altered and laying people but he only
[1:23:35] had compassion on one person as a person
[1:23:38] with a blood issue i believe
[1:23:43] um
[1:23:48] people don't know what compassion is
[1:23:50] compassion and love is the will of god
[1:23:52] this is from brother branham and looking
[1:23:53] for jesus
[1:23:55] and you can only exercise that as god
[1:23:56] gives it not human emotional passion not
[1:23:59] emotional love but divine love which can
[1:24:01] only be
[1:24:02] be rendered and given by god
[1:24:07] i'm so glad the lord showed compassion
[1:24:09] on me
[1:24:10] and you believers
[1:24:12] we would be lost without him
[1:24:23] i've just got a couple more scriptures
[1:24:26] but i wasn't sure if i was going to use
[1:24:27] them
[1:24:32] i'll just read this one out for you
[1:24:38] um this is deuteronomy 3
[1:24:41] uh deuteronomy 30
[1:24:43] and three almost the wrong one
[1:24:52] i saw aside from two
[1:24:54] and shall return unto the lord thy god
[1:24:55] and shall obey his voice according to
[1:24:57] all that i command thee
[1:24:59] this day that
[1:25:00] thou and thy children with all thine
[1:25:02] heart and with all thy soul and then the
[1:25:04] lord thy god will return
[1:25:06] will turn thy captivity and have
[1:25:08] compassion upon thee and will return to
[1:25:10] gather thee from all the nations
[1:25:13] whether
[1:25:14] the law thy god hath scattered thee
[1:25:18] i'm so glad that he has doing that now
[1:25:21] he's calling a bride he's he's going out
[1:25:23] to everybody
[1:25:29] don't let yourself be tricked by the
[1:25:30] devil
[1:25:32] the devil don't don't even listen to him
[1:25:34] in the garden of eden if eve hadn't even
[1:25:36] listened to the serpent and reason with
[1:25:37] the word of god
[1:25:39] we would never know jesus redeeming love
[1:25:41] but we do because it happened and that's
[1:25:43] fine but don't don't give don't give
[1:25:46] these things to the devil all these
[1:25:47] things or your mind secure them give
[1:25:49] them all to the lord
[1:25:54] and don't don't let things come
[1:25:57] against the word of the lord and sit in
[1:25:59] your mind don't let ill feelings come in
[1:26:02] don't let scorn come in don't let
[1:26:05] anything ungodly come in the christ is
[1:26:07] all revealed to the word
[1:26:10] if you do this is i wasn't going to edit
[1:26:12] him i i felt like i didn't want to but i
[1:26:15] just want to read it to you guys
[1:26:16] it's um proverbs 22 10. the lord
[1:26:19] lord gave to me a long time ago and
[1:26:22] the the scripture says cast out the
[1:26:24] scorn and contingent shall save ye and
[1:26:26] strife
[1:26:27] ye strife
[1:26:29] and reproach shall cease
[1:26:32] the devil tries with everything you know
[1:26:33] like it just it'll just be one little
[1:26:35] thing you know someone let's just say
[1:26:36] someone makes a mistake and it's real
[1:26:37] funny and you and you laugh and you're
[1:26:39] embarrassing you snicker to yourself
[1:26:40] about it you know you're scoring that
[1:26:42] person if they're just trying their best
[1:26:44] to serve the lord to surrender
[1:26:48] that's good for them but
[1:26:49] we can never look on upon someone and
[1:26:52] scorn or because that
[1:26:54] scorn bring it can bring an element of
[1:26:56] pride in the situation
[1:26:58] and that's like to me it's the opposite
[1:27:00] of compassion and the lord in the in
[1:27:02] this he said you know he gave us a way
[1:27:05] to get rid of it too he said cast a
[1:27:06] school in a row
[1:27:08] and contention shall go out and strife
[1:27:10] shall go and reproach i'll see so if you
[1:27:12] if you if you
[1:27:14] if you're struggling
[1:27:15] just just look at your life and see how
[1:27:17] you're treating people with if people
[1:27:19] are falling by mistakes are you showing
[1:27:20] compassion are you praying for them are
[1:27:22] you training your will and asking the
[1:27:24] lord to help them or are you laughing at
[1:27:26] their mistakes going haha i was once
[1:27:28] there or you're really caring for them
[1:27:30] because you know we all want to go on a
[1:27:32] rapture we all want to be ruptured and
[1:27:34] we don't want to leave anybody here we
[1:27:35] don't want anybody to be the devils or
[1:27:37] go to hell it's not it's not what the
[1:27:39] bride wants
[1:27:40] the bride will sigh and cry for the
[1:27:42] abominations that are done
[1:27:44] i hope this thing's helped you
[1:27:47] to our young kids
[1:27:49] it's good to see you you guys will be up
[1:27:50] here soon
[1:27:52] protect your minds
[1:27:53] give you all to christ okay
[1:27:57] god bless you all
[1:27:58] i hope this helps i hope you got
[1:28:00] something
[1:28:14] amen praise the lord
[1:28:17] um
[1:28:19] the heavenly vision and compassion
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:23] what these brothers just did was push
[1:28:26] the kingdom of god forward because
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:31] because
[1:28:32] there has been
[1:28:33] there has been something in that for
[1:28:35] everybody that has changed your life for
[1:28:37] the better for the kingdom of god
[1:28:40] that's that's the fact right so so what
[1:28:42] your brothers did was push forward the
[1:28:43] kingdom of god
[1:28:45] and i feel like we're moving forward and
[1:28:49] so uh
[1:28:50] and us being us we're not gonna we're
[1:28:52] not gonna lose any ground that we've
[1:28:53] gained and we certainly aren't to stop
[1:28:55] moving forward when we've got the enemy
[1:28:57] on the run either
[1:28:59] so i think we should we need to book on
[1:29:00] you seem to be the group administrator
[1:29:02] [Laughter]
[1:29:04] we need to book another one and i think
[1:29:07] yeah hey it done yep we're not going to
[1:29:09] lose any crowded man and we're just
[1:29:10] going to keep pushing forward and you
[1:29:11] ain't seen nothing yet
[1:29:13] that's how we do it around here because
[1:29:15] that's that's
[1:29:17] the king we are called to push forward
[1:29:19] for the kingdom of god
[1:29:21] that's what we do we push forward there
[1:29:23] the armor of god had nothing on his back
[1:29:25] there's no protection on the back anyone
[1:29:27] turn around and ran you go on
[1:29:29] all the protection is on the front
[1:29:30] because we're only called to move
