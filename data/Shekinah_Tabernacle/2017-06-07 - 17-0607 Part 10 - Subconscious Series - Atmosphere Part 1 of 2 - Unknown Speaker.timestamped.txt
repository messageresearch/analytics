[20:05] tuned to Psalm 91 Thank You musicians
[20:16] dwelling in God's atmosphere where
[20:19] perfect faith is as the subject for
[20:21] tonight dwelling and God's atmosphere
[20:25] where perfect faith is hallelujah my
[20:30] this is such an exciting thought for me
[20:33] and you know I'm so dependent on the
[20:35] Lord to bring it out because it's not an
[20:37] intellectually a thought it's very
[20:40] difficult for to convey such an awesome
[20:43] thought and so we're just depending on
[20:45] the Lord tonight amen some ninety one
[20:57] verse one he that dwelleth in the secret
[21:06] place of the Most High shall abide under
[21:11] the shadow of the Almighty let me read
[21:16] that again he or she that dwells in the
[21:21] secret place of the Most High shall
[21:25] abide under the shadow of the Almighty
[21:30] oh my lord bless the reading of your
[21:34] word Jesus name you may be seated you
[21:41] think about the shadow of Peter a man
[21:44] that was redeemed by the blood and the
[21:48] virtue that was placed in that shadow
[21:50] amen
[21:53] what happened when the shadow of Peter
[21:56] touched people something touched in
[22:02] their faith and they was healed and all
[22:06] manner of sicknesses and diseases left
[22:08] the people because the shadow of a
[22:11] redeemed man crossed it how much more I
[22:17] ask you this question how much more the
[22:21] shadow of the Most High
[22:23] the shadow of God to dwell in the secret
[22:31] place of the Most High shall abide to
[22:37] unite to marry to come into a place of
[22:43] constancy under the shadow of your money
[22:48] to be there to stay there to remain
[22:51] there to abide there amen under that
[22:55] shadow of the Almighty something takes
[23:01] place and we see with Peter how somebody
[23:09] would just be touched by the shadow of
[23:13] Peter could have such an effect on their
[23:17] lives
[23:18] how much more and we're going to see how
[23:21] much more the effect of remaining under
[23:25] the shadow of the Almighty staying under
[23:28] his wing staying close to him remaining
[23:31] in an atmosphere remaining in that
[23:34] secret place now you know the
[23:36] traditional sort of a secret place is
[23:38] your closet and hey if you want to have
[23:40] a closet and you make it a little prayer
[23:43] box that's awesome
[23:45] praise the Lord and that's and God might
[23:47] call you to do that and want you to do
[23:49] that that's absolutely wonderful there
[23:52] is nothing wrong brother branham said
[23:53] you can never pray too much so don't
[23:56] ever feel discouraged and don't take me
[23:57] wrong but you see the secret place is
[24:00] not just a geographical point in your
[24:04] room or somewhere in your house or
[24:06] somewhere in the bush some prayer cave
[24:08] that you may have but your secret place
[24:12] is actually it's your supernatural
[24:17] holiest of Holies relationship with God
[24:20] and now that's your entering in to the
[24:26] holiest of Holies with God into that
[24:28] Shekinah glory presence now I would like
[24:33] to and I'm sure you've heard it before
[24:35] but I just you know it's been said on
[24:37] Sunday you know you can bring to
[24:38] remembrance these things because it's
[24:40] expedience to hear these things again
[24:43] and so you see that secret place you we
[24:47] don't actually need to be on our knees
[24:50] in an awesome time of God to be in the
[24:53] secret place as much as that is so good
[24:56] and sometimes it takes that to get there
[24:58] and because we in 4 find ourselves under
[25:01] some trial or in some frustration that
[25:06] brings us into a carnal Staton and it
[25:09] that can be that can there can be a
[25:11] prolonged period of time and for some
[25:14] people you're probably in that state
[25:16] right now and for some people
[25:19] unfortunately have always been in that
[25:21] state and they may have walked in this
[25:23] message for many years and they've never
[25:26] entered into the holiest of Holies
[25:28] unfortunately their success what the
[25:30] case is for some people and then there's
[25:33] also people that have been into the
[25:35] holiest of Holies and have experiences
[25:37] with God and they are sealed and they've
[25:39] been baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[25:41] and they're walking and then for years
[25:44] they've left their first love and
[25:46] they've walked out of that place because
[25:48] of circumstances and things that's
[25:50] happened in their lives and ideologies
[25:53] that they may have followed or
[25:55] pollutions that they've allowed into
[25:57] their life that's taken them from that
[26:00] place that place of pure satisfaction
[26:02] that place where nothing can move you
[26:05] that place where perfect faith is
[26:14] Hebrews 10 16 to 20 this is still part
[26:18] of the opening scriptures so it says
[26:21] here verse is the Covenant that I will
[26:25] make with them after those days saith
[26:28] the Lord I will put my laws into their
[26:30] hearts and in their minds will I write
[26:34] them and their sins and iniquities will
[26:36] I remember no more now where remission
[26:41] of these as there is no more offering
[26:44] for sin having therefore brethren
[26:46] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[26:50] the blood of Jesus by a new and living
[26:53] way which he has consecrated for us
[26:57] through the veil that is to say his
[27:00] flesh and so you see it's not the Old
[27:06] Testament anymore where the high priests
[27:08] could go in once a year and by the blood
[27:13] of bulls and goats and sprinkle seven
[27:14] times and do all the ritual approach to
[27:17] God through the sacrificial system that
[27:20] was pointing to what we have but a
[27:22] beautiful time I love this actually I
[27:26] just love it so much and may I just
[27:28] share this with you a beautiful example
[27:30] as when you know on the day of
[27:32] resurrection when Jesus raised from the
[27:36] dead and the disciples they were so sad
[27:38] and merry and the other mirror I think
[27:40] it was went down into the term and they
[27:42] and they went down there and I'm
[27:45] probably not going to get this whole
[27:46] story and all in order or anything but
[27:48] they basically now they went down into
[27:50] this place and they went into the tomb
[27:52] and they looked around and they didn't
[27:56] see and see anything and then what they
[28:04] saw on the bed was a packet of
[28:11] like where his clothes was like some
[28:14] sort of clothing there and then there
[28:16] was an angel on the head of the bed and
[28:20] it and it shows that was showing
[28:23] something there there was this showing
[28:26] here is what it was there was two angels
[28:29] on the end and there was meant to be the
[28:31] Shekinah in the middle but you see now
[28:34] it had changed from being a symbol and
[28:37] an arc of a covenant and and angels on
[28:42] two ends protecting or guarding the way
[28:45] to the Ark of the Covenant or however
[28:46] people see that and something said turn
[28:51] around Mary I think it was the angel
[28:52] turn around and she saw him she saw the
[28:57] new and living way she saw the Lord
[29:00] Himself she came into connection with
[29:02] the new and living way she came into a
[29:05] personal contact with him amen and so I
[29:08] love that to show from the old to the
[29:10] new
[29:11] and so now Saints we have boldness to
[29:14] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[29:16] Jesus so you see that blood is powerful
[29:21] enough for you MERS if you have made
[29:23] mistakes today if you have made big
[29:25] mistakes in your life and you feel
[29:26] condemned by those things you don't have
[29:28] to remain in the state you don't have to
[29:30] remain out of the holiest of Holies you
[29:33] can have boldness by the blood now not
[29:36] boldness without the blood you need to
[29:38] recognize that it is the blood it is the
[29:40] atonement it is that that blood was
[29:42] spilled and your faith in the blood
