[5:09] Praise the Lord. Good morning. Good to
[5:12] see you all here this
[5:14] morning. You ready? Ready to praise the
[5:16] Lord. You're feeling good. Had a good
[5:18] sleep. All
[5:20] like, thankful that you're alive.
[5:25] Could be dead right now.
[5:28] Not that not that that's overly a bad
[5:31] thing, but when you're alive here, you
[5:34] have hope because you're
[5:37] alive. I believe it was Solomon that
[5:40] said, you know, there's no there's no
[5:41] desire. There's there's there's nothing
[5:43] in the grave. Once you're there, you're
[5:44] done. That's it. You know, regardless of
[5:47] what sort of situation we're in, if we
[5:48] wake up, we've got
[5:51] hope. It's Mother's Day today. Happy
[5:53] Mother's Day to all the mothers here.
[5:55] [Music]
[5:56] [Applause]
[6:02] I always did love my mother growing up.
[6:04] Still do. Always loved her. Um I
[6:08] remember being a kid
[6:10] maybe six, seven years old.
[6:13] We lived out in the country. There were
[6:16] like seven of us kids, children. So
[6:18] there was, you know, quite a big family
[6:21] and quite close together. So it was I
[6:23] looking back I think it was a lot of
[6:25] work for my mom to raise us all and
[6:28] um my father would take us out fishing
[6:32] maybe on a Saturday and we had this old
[6:34] Holden HQ station wagon in those days
[6:37] you all just piled in. I remember
[6:38] sitting in the back looking the other
[6:40] way out the back window so you know so
[6:43] the car's driving this way but I'm
[6:44] looking out this way that we would just
[6:46] sit in the back like that. It was in the
[6:47] 80s man. Things were good.
[6:50] You can do what you want. was
[6:52] fun. And um we would be driving down our
[6:56] long driveway and I would be looking
[6:57] back at the house and seeing mom waving
[6:59] on on the deck as we were
[7:02] leaving. And I would be quite sad cuz I
[7:05] would think, "Oh, poor mom. You know,
[7:07] we're all leaving her and leaving her
[7:09] there by herself cuz dad would take all
[7:10] the boys away." I thought, "Man, she
[7:12] probably wants to come fishing with us,
[7:14] but poor mother has to stay home."
[7:17] As I got older, I realized, man, she
[7:18] would have been so happy. Like, yes,
[7:20] hope you guys go for a long
[7:25] time. Yeah. No, it's
[7:27] um yeah, happy Mother's Day to all the
[7:30] moms and we appreciate all that you
[7:33] do. And you know, home is not the same
[7:36] without a mom in it. So, yeah, let's um
[7:40] let's stand this morning, commit the
[7:41] service to the Lord.

[23:23] freedom, save it. He's a prison. Shake
[23:27] your savior. If you got
[23:30] shame, he's a chain break. Let's sing
[23:33] the first verse
[23:35] [Music]
[23:37] again. If you've been walking the same
[23:40] old road for miles and
[23:44] miles. If you've been hearing the same

[23:54] same old holes
[23:57] inside, there's a better
[24:01] life. There's a better
[24:05] life. If you got
[24:08] pain, he's a pain taker.

[24:15] lost, he's a way
[24:19] maker. And if you need

[24:33] pain, if you got
[24:36] pain, he's a pain
[24:40] taker. If you feel
[24:44] lost, he's a way
[24:48] maker. If you need freedom, a
[24:52] saving, he's a prison shaking savior. If
[24:56] you got

[39:32] foundation this morning. And we don't

[39:52] Great to have you here. And as brother
[39:54] Isaac said, happy Mother's Day. God
[39:55] bless all the mothers. Amen. The fifth
[39:57] gospel. You know, Brother Brham, he said
[39:59] how to break a nation. He didn't say
[40:00] break fatherhood. He said you break
[40:02] motherhood. You've broken a nation.
[40:03] That's how vital you are to the nation.
[40:05] Amen. To to to the people of God and
[40:07] everything. And like say happy birthday,
[40:09] Stephanie. God bless
[40:11] you. Happy
[40:13] birthday. Amen. Praise the Lord. Great
[40:15] to have everyone here today. Amen. Let's
[40:17] go in the scripture. We're going to go
[40:18] to um we're going to go to Revelations
[40:21] chapter 3.
[40:23] So many things are going on in this day
[40:25] and I'm so thankful to be part of the
[40:27] family of God. Aren't you glad you're in
[40:29] his economy? I mean, nothing's out of
[40:32] cada. Everything's running right on
[40:34] schedule. You're running on schedule,
[40:35] too, you know. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[40:38] Um, so we're going to read here
[40:40] Revelations 3 and we're going to read
[40:42] from verse 14. Sorry again, I don't have
[40:44] a PowerPoint. I will get back to that
[40:45] one day, but um, sorry about that. Um,
[40:48] says Revelations 3 and 14. And it says,
[40:50] "And unto the angel of the church of
[40:51] Leadyians, write these things, sayeth
[40:53] the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
[40:55] the beginning of the creation of God. I
[40:57] know thy works, thou art neither cold
[40:59] nor hot. I would that thou work cold or
[41:01] hot." So then, because thou art
[41:03] lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I'll
[41:04] spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou
[41:06] saith, I am rich and increase with
[41:08] goods, and have need of nothing, and
[41:10] knowest not that thou art wretched,
[41:12] miserable, poor, blind, and naked. I
[41:14] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[41:16] the fire that thou mayest be rich in and
[41:18] white raignment that thou mayest be
[41:20] clothed and that the shame of thy
[41:22] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[41:24] eyes with Isav that thou mayest see. And
[41:27] just a bit of a context, we're going to
[41:28] go to the last chapter of Job. Job uh 42
[41:31] and just a couple of verses here. So Job
[41:33] 427 and 8. Who enjoyed the prayer
[41:36] meeting on Wednesday night? Amen. Thank
[41:38] you, brother. Appreciate that. Amen. God
[41:40] bless you. Amen. So Job 42:7
[41:44] and8 reads like this. Uh this is after
[41:48] you know God God has spoken answered Job
[41:51] and then he begins to address Job's
[41:53] friends. You could put that
[41:55] in friends you know anyway they thought
[41:59] they were doing a good thing but they
[42:00] weren't. And uh so it says here as and
[42:03] uh it was so that after the Lord had
[42:05] spoken these words unto Job, the Lord
[42:07] said unto Eleph the Temonite, my wrath
[42:09] is kindled against thee and against thy
[42:11] two friends. For thou have not spoken to
[42:13] me the thing that is right, as my
[42:15] servant Job hath. Therefore take unto
[42:17] you now seven bulocks and seven rams,
[42:19] and go to my servant Job, and offer up
[42:21] for yourselves a burnt offering. and my
[42:23] servant Job shall pray for you. For I
[42:26] for him will I accept, least I deal with
[42:28] you after your folly, in that ye have
[42:30] not spoken to me the thing which is
[42:32] right like my servant
[42:35] Job. And um Amen. So let's let's um
[42:39] let's bow heads in a word of prayer. But
[42:40] I just want to ask you a question. What
[42:41] have you come for today? What have you
[42:43] come what is what's your expectation for
[42:45] this service? just hear a good sermon or
[42:48] come in contact with Almighty God that
[42:49] whatever your needs are, your burdens
[42:51] are, you don't carry them away, but God
[42:53] steps on the scene and does the
[42:54] miraculous. Amen. I believe God could
[42:56] change all of our lives in these few
[42:58] moments. Amen. So, let's let's bring our
[43:00] needs before the Lord. You got financial
[43:02] need, spiritual need, whatever it is,
[43:04] health need, let's just lift it before
[43:05] the Lord. Almighty God, we want to thank
[43:07] you so much. We can gather in your
[43:09] presence once again, Lord. We do not
[43:11] take these opportunities for granted,
[43:12] Father. We appreciate so much we can
[43:14] gather Lord because Lord you said where
[43:16] two or three gathered in my name there
[43:18] you are in the midst Lord we acknowledge
[43:20] your presence among us even now we thank
[43:21] you for it Lord and pray to God you
[43:23] anoint speaker and hearer Lord Jesus
[43:25] meet every need father you know what's
[43:27] going on in all of our lives we want to
[43:29] thank you that Lord we're not out of
[43:30] your care out of your care Lord you're
[43:33] guiding us father you're watching over
[43:35] us you're shaping us into your image
[43:37] Lord we thank you for that father may
[43:39] you bless each one touch each life Lord
[43:41] whatever need Lord we have come in these
[43:43] doors with. Father, I pray we wouldn't
[43:44] walk out with them, but we'd walk out
[43:45] with an answer, saying, "Thank you,
[43:47] Lord." Hallelujah. Lord, a revelation
[43:48] would drop in our hearts, Lord, knowing
[43:50] that you have answered. You're on your
[43:51] way. You're working, Lord. We thank you
[43:53] so much. Be those who are streaming as
[43:55] well, Lord. Be their portion in Jesus
[43:57] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may have
[44:00] your seats um this morning. So, I want
[44:02] to pose a question about uh who's whose
[44:06] mouthpiece are you? Now, I want to I
[44:08] want to speak about these things. It's
[44:10] very important when we think about who
[44:12] are we speaking for because you know we
[44:14] understand that uh it's been a
[44:15] monumental uh week or couple of weeks.
[44:18] We had the previous pope die on uh
[44:20] Easter Monday. Then we had an American
[44:22] pope never happened in the history of
[44:24] the world as you know a pope come out of
[44:26] America and and it's a very significant
[44:28] we know what brother Brandham spoke
[44:29] about those things but you know uh
[44:31] because there came a time and I believe
[44:33] it already is you know what I really
[44:34] think is God allows these things to
[44:36] happen that we realize it's already
[44:38] there you know like you know like even
[44:41] if you look at uh um you know demon
[44:43] power's always been here right and you
[44:45] look at you know 20 years ago in the 80s
[44:47] the '9s a lot of demonic things were
[44:49] cartoonish you know the movies the
[44:51] films, they seem so innocent. But now
[44:53] with the with the advancement of
[44:55] technology and CGI and all these things,
[44:58] what it really is is no longer a
[44:59] cartoon, but it's really here and it's
[45:01] all of its horrible wicked detail.
[45:03] Right? So the same thing with the demon
[45:05] powers working in religious, political
[45:07] realms. They've already been here the
[45:08] whole time, but what we see now is the
[45:10] evidence of it. You know, to me, it's so
[45:12] astounding when you look at this where
[45:14] it says in Revelations 13 where where it
[45:16] says that the power would come out of
[45:18] the come out of the earth. And we know
[45:20] that this is America in prophecy. And
[45:22] you know, it would say that it would
[45:24] have two horns like a lamb, but it would
[45:25] speak as the dragon. So, so, so this
[45:28] nation that was birthed under freedom of
[45:30] religion would begin to turn would would
[45:33] morph or be or be deformed until it
[45:36] becomes the mouthpiece of the dragon
[45:38] itself. It's been here for a long time,
[45:40] folks. When brother said about how that
[45:43] Catholic system came in when Kennedy was
[45:45] voted in by a crooked voting machine,
[45:47] you know, that changed the whole course
[45:49] of America. But that that scripture and
[45:51] he spake as a dragon came into
[45:53] manifestation. They say, "Well, oh, this
[45:55] is going to get us ready." No, the power
[45:57] of God has called out a bride. Amen. We
[46:01] don't need persecution to call us out.
[46:04] We've been called out. But I say
[46:05] persecution will just manifest what's in
[46:07] you already. Amen. It's like the
[46:09] apostles, you know, when they came in
[46:11] before the Sanhedrin and they were
[46:13] commanded, don't preach in Jesus' name
[46:14] anymore, were threatened and beaten and
[46:16] all these things. Amen. It just came out
[46:18] the overcoming power of the Holy Ghost
[46:20] within them. They didn't bow to what the
[46:22] enemy wanted them to do. They said, "Who
[46:24] should we please, God or man?" Amen. And
[46:26] then and then said, "We're just going to
[46:28] keep preaching. We're going to keep
[46:29] doing what we do." And then they came
[46:30] and had a prayer meeting. God came down
[46:32] and shook the place. Amen. Filled them
[46:34] with a b boldness and they walked out
[46:35] more victorious when they walked in.
[46:37] Amen. So all that squeeze is just a is
[46:40] going to prove what's in you. I say even
[46:43] the squeeze of a lukewarmness of this
[46:45] age is proving what's in you already.
[46:48] Amen. Because remember, God is waiting,
[46:50] he God is preparing a bride. Okay? And
[46:54] when the bride goes up, Satan comes down
[46:56] is incarnate in the beast. Right? At the
[46:58] moment, he's a false prophet, the pope,
[47:00] right? But then Satan comes down,
[47:02] incarnates him, he becomes the beast
[47:03] incarnate, becomes Satan incarnate,
[47:06] right? Brother B talks about the fourth
[47:07] seal. But that can't happen until we go
[47:10] up. So what is the thing that's holding
[47:13] the wrath of God, the destruction of
[47:14] God? Like brother Ed said on Wednesday,
[47:16] it's sincere, sold out group of people,
[47:20] praying to the Lord, surrendered to God.
[47:23] So nothing's out of cater. God's getting
[47:25] you ready, right? You're you're the
[47:28] thing that has to come out of the way.
[47:30] Then God can do what he wants to do upon
[47:31] this earth in terms of the great
[47:33] tribulation. So don't get don't panic
[47:36] about those things because you realize
[47:38] if that's there, then I'm here.
[47:40] Amen. If the tears are doing what the
[47:42] tears are doing, the wheat's doing what
[47:44] it's doing, right? We can say, "Well,
[47:45] the tears are so advanced and so
[47:47] mature." No, they come up to maturity
[47:50] together. Amen. So, I think we can just
[47:53] rejoice. Amen. Right. Don't be afraid of
[47:56] these say, "Oh, what's going to happen?"
[47:57] God has you in his hand. I'm not even
[48:00] started what I'm talking about this
[48:01] morning, but I just want you to realize
[48:02] God has you in his hand. If you've been
[48:04] filled with the Holy Ghost, you're as
[48:06] safe as safe can be. You're sealed to
[48:07] the day of your redemption. Amen. But
[48:09] you see, as as America has become the
[48:11] mouthpiece of the dragon, I say, "Whose
[48:13] mouthpiece are you this morning?" I just
[48:15] want to read a quote before we move on
[48:16] with this thought. He says, "Now I'm
[48:18] going to say something. This is in
[48:19] recognizing your day and its message.
[48:21] Now I'm going to say something. National
[48:22] force put Israel in her homeland.
[48:24] National force will put the church in
[48:26] the world council of churches, but the
[48:28] power of God will put the people in the
[48:30] bride." I'm trust you can say that
[48:32] quote's been fulfilled in my life. The
[48:33] power of God has put me in the bride.
[48:36] The world forces this way, the world
[48:37] forces that way, but God forces upward.
[48:40] The spirit of God, which is the word of
[48:42] God, my word is spirit and life, will
[48:44] put the bride in her place because
[48:46] she'll recognize her position in the
[48:48] word. Amen. Amen. When she's in Christ,
[48:51] she'll put will put her in her place. No
[48:53] national force will do it. But the
[48:55] national force did drive Israel to the
[48:57] homeland. The national forces of the
[48:59] World Council of Churches will drive
[49:01] every organization into it. But the
[49:03] power of God will raise the bride into
[49:05] glory out of
[49:07] it. Amen. So what have we got to fear?
[49:10] That's why you know you probably look at
[49:12] last few years, last 10 years, however
[49:13] long, God has poured his spirit out more
[49:16] and more and more. Why? Because the
[49:19] power of God is putting her the bride
[49:21] into her position. Amen. Moving us
[49:23] higher in revelation. Amen. Causing us
[49:25] to realize who we are. Amen. That we
[49:27] realize we're not our own mouthpiece,
[49:29] but we are the mouthpiece of the Lord.
[49:31] Amen. But you see now we look here at uh
[49:34] Revelations 3 that I opened with is that
[49:36] there's three three three groups of
[49:38] people here. There's the cold, there's
[49:39] the lukewarm, and there's the hot. And
[49:42] each one each one will be speaking for
[49:45] something. Now, just to go um just here
[49:48] as a bit of a foundation, uh the hot can
[49:51] become lukewarm and then become hot
[49:53] again, right? Even if you're cold, there
[49:56] came a time when we were all cold. We're
[49:58] all indifferent. Even if you're raising
[50:00] the message, yeah, there's an
[50:01] indifference about you. Well, my parents
[50:03] are going to take me here. Why am I
[50:04] here? What's the point? What's the use?
[50:06] It doesn't speak to me. It goes over my
[50:08] head. Who cares? That's being cold. But
[50:10] then God begin to turn up the
[50:12] temperature. Begin to pour out his
[50:14] spirit upon you and begin to bring a
[50:15] conviction into your life. And you begin
[50:17] to realize, hey, he died for me. He's
[50:19] redeemed me. His blood's for me. Amen.
[50:21] This message is for me. It's come to
[50:23] identify me as the bride of Christ.
[50:25] Amen. And what happens then? Then a heat
[50:27] comes into your life. Amen. And a light
[50:29] begins to be ignited. Amen. What
[50:31] happens? You go from cold to hot.
[50:35] But God, but the devil don't want you
[50:37] hot. He wants you lukewarm cuz he's
[50:39] lukewarm. He wants you to have his
[50:42] experience. Right? So now there's a
[50:44] thing where where we can go from hot to
[50:46] lukewarm, but we can go back hot again.
[50:48] Just like you started cold, you don't
[50:50] stay cold. Amen. You become hot.
[50:53] Hallelujah. On fire with the Holy Ghost.
[50:55] Amen. I think God's doing something
[50:57] right now. That's all right. Amen.
[51:00] Praise the Lord. Now, you see Jo, see,
[51:02] let's just Okay, so a mouthpiece, it
[51:04] means someone who speaks for a person or
[51:06] a group or organization. Now, we know
[51:08] that spirits travel on words. As I spoke
[51:10] with that quote there just before where
[51:12] Jesus said, he said, "The words that I
[51:14] speak to you, they are spirit and they
[51:15] are life." So, every word that's
[51:17] projected, doesn't matter who's
[51:18] speaking, there's a spirit behind those
[51:20] words. If you look at the recordings,
[51:22] now I don't know German, but if you look
[51:24] at the recordings of of of of Hitler and
[51:26] his political rallies, and he'd always
[51:29] end with an amen, just like the Lutheran
[51:31] priesthood, but he was anointed, and
[51:33] that anointing spread from him over
[51:34] Germany, over all those different parts
[51:36] of the world. Then we came into a
[51:38] amateur tribulation there, but it was
[51:40] anointing. You look at Trump and what he
[51:42] does. He's anointed. He gets people
[51:44] under his influence. You look at
[51:46] politicians, religious leaders, they're
[51:47] anointed. You I was watching I was
[51:49] watching uh um footage there of when the
[51:51] new pope came on the balcony. Everyone's
[51:53] cheering and praising. Children are
[51:55] crying and all these things going on. I
[51:57] say what? They've come under an
[51:59] anointing. Amen. So, so, so these
[52:02] things, you know, and have you ever
[52:04] spoken to someone and they say a
[52:07] particular phrasal thing and you think
[52:09] that's just someone else speaking? Who's
[52:11] ever come across that? Like you're
[52:13] talking to someone and it's like you're
[52:15] talking to someone else cuz the how they
[52:16] speak what they say it's like man this
[52:19] person's just teleported here speaking
[52:20] now they've gone again. What's that?
[52:22] They've come under the influence of that
[52:24] spirit of that person. Amen. Now this is
[52:28] of course quite evident when children
[52:29] normally repeat what their parents say.
[52:31] But it's got to go from just repeating
[52:33] or being a parent of the parents to
[52:34] having their own conviction. Amen. Where
[52:36] it's it's it's their idea, it's their
[52:38] faith, it's their conviction that comes
[52:40] in. Amen. But now you take this on a
[52:42] deeper level and it's and it's now it's
[52:44] when a spirit speaks or the Holy Ghost
[52:46] speaks through a person. Remember we'll
[52:48] be a mouthpiece for someone or
[52:49] something. We all are. You say, "Well,
[52:51] I've got my own thoughts." No, you
[52:52] don't. No, you don't. You're being
[52:54] influenced by by an unseen world, right?
[52:57] Either above or below. It depends who
[52:59] you yield yourself to. It's either
[53:01] through the heart of love. Amen. A pure
[53:03] love and a faith or an ought or an
[53:05] offense. It depends who's going to speak
[53:07] to you. Because we got to be careful
[53:09] what we let use these lips. Well, I'm
[53:12] sealed to the day of my redemption. But
[53:14] you've got a human spirit, right? You
[53:16] get grumpy like everyone else gets
[53:17] grumpy. You get moody like everyone else
[53:19] gets moody. You get annoyed like
[53:20] everyone else gets annoyed. Okay,
[53:23] there's some people here. Everyone else
[53:25] has had a body change already or
[53:27] something. I don't know. But you see, we
[53:28] all we all are because why? We are
[53:30] people of like passion. We're all human,
[53:32] right? But the difference is we have the
[53:34] Holy Ghost on the inside of the inside
[53:36] of us. He is the difference maker. Amen.
[53:38] So if you don't have him living on the
[53:40] inside of you, seeing his overcoming
[53:41] power in your life, I say give, sell
[53:44] everything you have. Sell out to him.
[53:47] I'm just not I'm not talking naturally.
[53:48] I'm talking about your affections, your
[53:50] emotions, your desires. Just put it
[53:51] straight on Calvary and you'll see what
[53:53] happens. Amen. God will you'll never
[53:55] stay the same.
[53:58] Amen. Like brother speaks about uh uh in
[54:00] the message ashamed. He's speaking about
[54:02] music now, but there still words
[54:03] traveling, spirits traveling, right? He
[54:05] says, "Way back in the jungles of Africa
[54:07] on the safari hunters, they had some h
[54:10] um high-powered radios to hear Elvis
[54:11] Presley Pat Boon them guys with that
[54:13] rock and roll and twist and the natives
[54:15] trying to u trying to see them act
[54:18] along, jerking their head and acting
[54:19] like that. The natives stood and looked
[54:21] at them. But you see, they're not
[54:23] Americans like Pat Boon and Elvis
[54:24] Presley, Ricky Nelson, and them guys
[54:26] are. They're not judices of that type.
[54:28] You see, it's a spirit. And the spirit
[54:30] is not only in America. It has spread
[54:32] itself over the world to bring them to
[54:33] the battle of Armageddon. Amen. They act
[54:36] like that whether they are whether uh
[54:38] whatever nation they come from, Africa,
[54:40] India, wherever it is, that vulgar stuff
[54:42] that spread all over the earth by just
[54:44] one man starting it. So has the gospel
[54:46] and the power of almighty God has spread
[54:48] around the world. And the separation
[54:50] time is now taking place when God is
[54:52] calling a bride and the devil's calling
[54:54] a church. Let me be part of the bride,
[54:56] he says. I mean, that spirit has spread.
[54:58] I mean, I tell you what, if you're a
[55:00] swifty, I'd stop being a
[55:02] swifty. A lot of people have no idea
[55:04] what I'm talking about. That's good.
[55:05] Amen. But you see, those spirits that
[55:07] started with Elvis Presley, those ones
[55:08] who just spread and spread and got more
[55:10] powerful and stronger as as the spirit
[55:13] has grown, right? But the power of God
[55:17] has grown too because the word has
[55:19] become more alive, more real to you.
[55:22] Amen. So now that you know the power of
[55:23] almighty God has come around the earth
[55:25] to to to call a
[55:28] bride. Now as I said there's three
[55:31] different types. There's the cold,
[55:33] there's a lukewarm, and there's the
[55:34] people who are hot. Now the difference
[55:37] is really how much you allow the word to
[55:39] live through you. That's really the
[55:40] thing. It's more than emotion. I've seen
[55:42] people are very emotional, very caught
[55:44] up in just worship. Nothing wrong with
[55:46] that. But their lives, they're not
[55:48] interested in living the word. I say in
[55:50] reality they're cold or lukewarm at
[55:52] best. Amen. So it's not your outward
[55:54] expression which dictates how hot you
[55:56] are on fire for God. You can be a very
[55:58] quiet person. You can be very reserved.
[56:01] But there's a flame. There's a burning
[56:03] passion. Lord, you're my everything.
[56:04] Lord, I want to live for you, Lord.
[56:06] Lord, I just want to I'm so glad I'm
[56:08] yours, Lord. There's a burning passion.
[56:09] You're sold out completely. That's
[56:11] someone who's on fire. Amen. So, it's
[56:13] not just don't don't get it in your
[56:15] mind. It's a it's got to be an outward
[56:17] expression. We're all built differently.
[56:20] Praise God. God is a God of righty. Some
[56:22] of us are very vocal. Some of us are
[56:24] not. That's fine. Just let God impact
[56:26] your life. Amen. Let him let him
[56:28] influence you. Like brother Bram said in
[56:29] the um in the uh Deep Calls to the Deep
[56:32] film, you know, the prophet standing
[56:33] there. There's a man standing in front
[56:34] of him and he's just standing just like
[56:36] like this. And Brother Bram says, "I can
[56:38] see you're
[56:40] excited." You can't tell by the outward
[56:42] really what's going on in the inside.
[56:45] Amen.
[56:47] Now, so never measure yourself by
[56:50] someone else. You just be you and God.
[56:52] You just be yourself and God. Be the
[56:54] individual God made you to be. Well, I'm
[56:56] well I'm well I'm too loud. Be loud.
[56:58] Well, I'm too quiet. That's fine. Just
[57:01] be you. Just love the Lord. Amen. So
[57:04] now, whose mouth mouthpiece are you?
[57:06] Amen. So now we know that we are living
[57:08] in the age where the spoken word, the
[57:10] power of the spoken word has been
[57:11] restored into the bride and it's present
[57:13] now. The manifestation of the third pull
[57:16] is here. It's the opening of the word.
[57:17] But what? When the word opens, the power
[57:19] is released. Amen. Every time. When the
[57:21] word opened to Luther, the just shall
[57:23] live by faith. It gave them a faith. I'm
[57:25] justified by faith. It changed their
[57:27] lives. Amen. When the word came open
[57:28] more to Wesley with sanctification, it
[57:31] gave them power to live a sanctified
[57:33] life. Amen. When the word came over to
[57:35] the Pentecostals, open to the
[57:36] Pentecostals, what? The power came that
[57:39] the gifts would be restored because the
[57:40] word came open to them. Amen. Now, what
[57:42] about when the full word has come open?
[57:45] Amen. where it's more than just a
[57:46] restoration of the gifts, but God
[57:47] himself dwells in you. Amen. Manifesting
[57:50] his word, proving his word in you. Amen.
[57:52] That when you step into a room, Jesus
[57:54] steps into the room. Amen. When you go
[57:56] to school, God goes to school. When you
[57:58] step on your work site, that's God
[58:00] stepping on a work site. Hallelujah.
[58:03] Why? Cuz he's living in you.
[58:06] Amen. Why? Cuz now the full word has
[58:08] come. So the word we, you know, so the
[58:12] manifestation of spoken word is here.
[58:14] You say, "Well, we need persecution to
[58:16] activate it." No, brother said, "It's
[58:17] already here. We need a squeeze." We're
[58:20] already being squeezed. It's here right
[58:23] now.
[58:25] Amen. We've seen it evident around us,
[58:27] have we not? It's just a greater of what
[58:28] you already have living. Amen. So, if
[58:31] you're a prayer warrior, when that power
[58:33] of the spoken word comes into your life,
[58:34] you just pray in a greater way. Amen. If
[58:37] you're a singer, well, you know what's
[58:38] going to happen. Amen. or a preacher or
[58:40] you praying for people, whatever it is,
[58:42] God God will anoint your life. God wants
[58:45] to use you as a mouthpiece. If that's
[58:46] all you get out of this service, God
[58:48] wants to take your lips, take your vocal
[58:50] cords, take your heart, and live through
[58:53] you. Amen. That when people come into
[58:55] your presence, they're actually coming
[58:56] into God's presence. You say, "Me?" Yes.
[58:58] Because his blood can cleanse any
[59:00] spirit, can cleanse anybody. Amen.
[59:03] There's nothing too hard for the Lord.
[59:04] You got to realize that God has cleansed
[59:06] you by the power of his blood. Amen.
[59:08] When he hung on Calvary, he said, "It is
[59:10] finished." He's saying, "I have
[59:12] purchased their redemption and
[59:13] completeness." Amen. I purchased their
[59:16] salvation. It is done. Amen. The power
[59:18] to cleanse the vilest, darkest, most
[59:21] religious message believer in the world
[59:23] is here.
[59:25] Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:28] I just dropped that. But you got to
[59:30] realize, see, you know, so stop
[59:32] wrestling with yourself and just start
[59:34] accepting what God has already done for
[59:36] you. I mean, me, I could never be saved.
[59:38] Well, he Well, he said he's done it. How
[59:41] could I ever go free? Well, he's already
[59:43] done it. You just got to choose the
[59:44] liberty. Well, could I walk in the power
[59:46] of God? Absolutely. Amen. Could he use
[59:49] my vocal cords and step into a
[59:51] conversation and set someone free? Yes,
[59:53] sir. Absolutely he can.
[59:56] Why? Because the power is here to do it.
[59:59] Amen.
[1:00:01] You think yo yo we you know we look at
[1:00:03] the prophets you know we look at we look
[1:00:04] at ones like Moses you know where he'd
[1:00:06] stand there and you know who would have
[1:00:08] liked to been there seeing Moses do what
[1:00:10] he did that would have been amazing
[1:00:11] right right see him you know stand
[1:00:13] before Pharaoh and say let my people go
[1:00:15] and throw down his rod and you know it
[1:00:17] turns into a snake and his you know
[1:00:19] Pharaoh's magicians do the same thing
[1:00:21] and then Moses' rod eats up their rods
[1:00:23] and then then Moses picks his snake rod
[1:00:26] up it becomes a rod again and where did
[1:00:28] their rods go and Moses one just
[1:00:30] swallowed up their power, right? And God
[1:00:32] was showing through Moses. Now, you got
[1:00:34] to think about this. This is a man under
[1:00:36] the blood of bulls and goats. I mean, I
[1:00:38] was listening to the breach message this
[1:00:39] week and Brother Ram said, "Now, you
[1:00:41] know, if if if the power of the blood of
[1:00:44] bulls and goats, now I'm going to go
[1:00:45] through a few examples, can do that in a
[1:00:47] person, how much more the blood of Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ, I mean, where Moses could stand
[1:00:52] there un called by
[1:00:54] prophecy." Amen. He was prophesied of
[1:00:57] that he was going to come and deliver
[1:01:00] Israel out of Egypt. His name wasn't
[1:01:02] mentioned, but he was part of the
[1:01:03] promise God gave Abraham. Amen. So when
[1:01:05] he walked into after being commissioned
[1:01:06] at the burning bush, God sent him down
[1:01:08] into Egypt, he was the fulfillment of
[1:01:10] prophecy. Amen. So nothing could stop
[1:01:12] his life. Amen. So he went in there and
[1:01:15] when he throw his rod down, picked it
[1:01:16] up, it became a rod again. Right? What
[1:01:18] was he telling Pharaoh? Because Pharaoh
[1:01:21] on his crown he has two or one cobra,
[1:01:23] right? on his crown representing he's
[1:01:25] the king right but but by throwing down
[1:01:27] his staff Moses doing it becomes a snake
[1:01:30] picks it up again God was actually
[1:01:32] telling Satan Satan I have given power
[1:01:34] to my son to loose you and to bind you
[1:01:38] amen to control you at every hand amen
[1:01:40] this is what you're seeing Satan and
[1:01:42] he's going to go and I'm going to prove
[1:01:44] it through him until you let my people
[1:01:46] go amen so he turned the turned the um
[1:01:50] Nile into blood brought the hail brought
[1:01:52] the darkness brought all these things
[1:01:54] and you think my he opened the Red Sea
[1:01:56] and did incredible things you say man
[1:01:57] wouldn't that be amazing I say that was
[1:01:59] just a man under the blood of bulls and
[1:02:02] goats I mean when Joshua stood there and
[1:02:04] he and he said sun stand still moon you
[1:02:06] hang there over the valley of Agelon I
[1:02:08] mean that was a man under the blood of
[1:02:10] bulls and goats controlling nature
[1:02:12] because he realized also that he was
[1:02:14] part of the prophecy taking the people
[1:02:15] in friends we are the fulfillment of
[1:02:17] prophecy as well you got to see your
[1:02:20] life as a fulfillment of prophecy amen
[1:02:22] when the scripture says in Revelations,
[1:02:24] the spirit and the bride say come. Who
[1:02:26] are those people? Who were who did John
[1:02:28] see? He saw you. Amen. When he saw a
[1:02:31] multitude around the throne. Amen.
[1:02:32] Brother said John saw himself there. And
[1:02:35] that and that group there in Revelations
[1:02:37] 5 is the whole of the redeemed of all
[1:02:39] ages. Amen. So he saw you there. Amen.
[1:02:43] Glory. It was a symbol. Now it's a
[1:02:46] reality. Amen. It was a symbol of
[1:02:48] revelation. Now it's flesh.
[1:02:51] Amen. I trust when you see the seals
[1:02:54] come open, you see the lamb coming to
[1:02:56] claim you. Amen. The second time I
[1:02:58] heard, I know I've said it, but I'll
[1:02:59] tell it again. Amen. The first time I
[1:03:01] heard the seals, I saw horse riders,
[1:03:02] tribulation, the two prophets, and all
[1:03:04] these things. But then when I heard it
[1:03:06] the second time, all I saw was the lamb,
[1:03:09] step off out of eternity to claim me.
[1:03:13] Hallelujah. That's what I saw. That's
[1:03:15] why I see the opening of the seals. God
[1:03:17] saying, "You're mine. I'm going to carry
[1:03:19] you away." Hallelujah. The devil can't
[1:03:21] mess with you anymore. You're mine.
[1:03:23] Amen. You're in my possession. Amen.
[1:03:24] I've wrestled. I've overcome. My blood
[1:03:26] is still working. Amen. I'm there to
[1:03:28] intercede for you. I'm here to carry you
[1:03:29] away in this season. Hallelujah.
[1:03:33] Amen. This is See, this is what you
[1:03:34] should see when the seals come open. Oh,
[1:03:36] I need to know the doctrine. No, just
[1:03:37] have the experience of the doctrine.
[1:03:39] See, the revelation under it will change
[1:03:41] your
[1:03:42] life. Hallelujah. So now the cold I'd
[1:03:45] say is like in Jesus day I say the cold
[1:03:47] are like the uh well so I just got to go
[1:03:50] back you know backtrack here. So if
[1:03:52] Moses could do that under the blood of
[1:03:53] bulls and goats how much more you now
[1:03:56] you know we're amazed at Elijah we're
[1:03:57] amazed at Elisha we're amazed at um
[1:04:01] Isaiah and all the prophets and what
[1:04:03] they did but it was all under the blood
[1:04:04] of bulls and goats. How much more are
[1:04:06] people that have been cleansed back by
[1:04:08] the blood of Jesus Christ?
[1:04:11] Amen. But you see now because this is
[1:04:13] the age of the spoken word, what happens
[1:04:15] is the devil wants to get in and pervert
[1:04:18] that. He wants to get his hands on that
[1:04:20] power. Now he can't, but he'll try.
[1:04:24] Right? It's just like remember the fir,
[1:04:26] you know, well, I'm going to say it
[1:04:27] again. I'll tell it again. Right? It's
[1:04:29] just like, you know, the first time we
[1:04:31] went to Canada, the devil tried to stop
[1:04:33] us going by bringing a storm down. And
[1:04:35] the Lord actually told Christine saying,
[1:04:37] "The devil's asking me if if he will
[1:04:40] permit me to allow him to stop you going
[1:04:43] and he wants to give you CO and all
[1:04:45] these things and and said, "Now you've
[1:04:46] got to ask. And why'd you ask?" Lord,
[1:04:48] may we leave? We're going to Canada. We
[1:04:50] got on the plane, we went to Canada. Did
[1:04:52] he still send the storm? Yes. Couple
[1:04:55] hours later, he closed the airport. Did
[1:04:57] we end up getting CO? Yes. when we got
[1:04:59] home and we had a station. But the whole
[1:05:02] point is he wants to get his hands on
[1:05:04] it, he'll try and he'll end up fussing
[1:05:07] anyway. Just because he can't get his
[1:05:09] hands on it doesn't mean he's going to
[1:05:10] quit, right? You know, just like the
[1:05:13] second time we went to Canada, he tried
[1:05:14] to stop us going again. He sent a storm
[1:05:17] trying to stop us flying out of
[1:05:18] Oakuckland this time. Did we get on the
[1:05:20] plane? Yes. Was the storm there yet? No.
[1:05:22] Did it come anyway? Yes, it did. It's
[1:05:24] just like he throws a tantrum because he
[1:05:26] can't, you know, get his hands on these
[1:05:27] things.
[1:05:29] Amen. So the devil throws a tantrum be
[1:05:31] because because he re you know he knows
[1:05:33] in his heart he cannot get creative
[1:05:35] power. That's the one thing he can know.
[1:05:37] He cannot create. He cannot. Only the
[1:05:40] power of God, the spirit of God can
[1:05:41] create. He'll pervert though. Like sin
[1:05:44] is righteousness perverted. Amen.
[1:05:46] Unbelief is faith perverted. You see
[1:05:48] sickness is health perverted. All these
[1:05:50] things are a perversion cuz that's all
[1:05:52] he can do. Amen. So now he wants to take
[1:05:55] your lips and pervert your voice. that's
[1:05:58] no longer speaking life and peace and
[1:06:00] edifying the body in love. Edifying is
[1:06:03] building up. You're in the construction
[1:06:05] industry.
[1:06:07] Amen. We're ordained to edify the body
[1:06:10] of Christ. We're here to build each
[1:06:12] other up. We're not here to tear one
[1:06:14] another down. Satan has come to rob,
[1:06:16] kill, and destroy. Tear down. Amen. But
[1:06:18] the voice of God is here to build up.
[1:06:20] Amen. To encourage. Amen. To to to to
[1:06:24] stabilize people in their walks. Amen.
[1:06:26] To encourage. You can do it. You know,
[1:06:29] it's like I was I was there at
[1:06:30] Gabriela's school camp and we were we
[1:06:32] were walking up a walking up a river and
[1:06:35] it was, you know, oh well, yay deep on
[1:06:37] me. But, you know, all you know, through
[1:06:39] all these rocks and all these things we
[1:06:40] had to ford up this river for a few
[1:06:42] hundred meters and, you know, there were
[1:06:43] some of the students, they felt like
[1:06:45] they couldn't do it. So, us as parents,
[1:06:46] we just grabbed them by the hand. And
[1:06:48] you know I was taking one girl used to
[1:06:49] be a neighbor of us down in Kelson
[1:06:51] Nonica and she's you know so so I'm
[1:06:53] leading her and you can barely see where
[1:06:55] the rocks are and cuz it's a bit muddy
[1:06:57] and some of them have got you know uh
[1:06:59] gunk or slime or whatever on them.
[1:07:01] They're slippery. So I'm trying to say
[1:07:02] now step here and go here and let's go
[1:07:04] this way and stand here and you know and
[1:07:06] so we're walking up this river right and
[1:07:08] she's saying I can't do it. I can't do
[1:07:10] it. I say you're doing it. We're
[1:07:13] walking. To me that's edifying the body.
[1:07:15] You sometimes you think man I can't do
[1:07:17] it. How can I make another step in the
[1:07:18] Lord? But someone's got you by the hand.
[1:07:20] Amen. God wants to use you to encourage
[1:07:22] one another. Amen. So what happens?
[1:07:24] Someone will take you by the hand. But
[1:07:25] you are doing it. You are serving the
[1:07:28] Lord. You are a Christian. She said that
[1:07:30] so much. I can't do it. I'm not. Yeah. I
[1:07:32] said you but but non you are. And what
[1:07:34] did we do? Did we stop? No. We got up
[1:07:36] the end of the river. We got out.
[1:07:39] Hallelujah. Edify one another.
[1:07:43] But you see
[1:07:44] now lukewarmness is dangerous because
[1:07:47] the cold, the cold's like the publican
[1:07:50] sinners, you know, those who are just
[1:07:51] totally indifferent in Jesus' day. They
[1:07:53] didn't care. That's not dangerous.
[1:07:55] Cold's not dangerous, right? But it's
[1:07:57] the lukewarm that are the problem.
[1:07:59] That's a dangerous state to be in
[1:08:01] because the lukewarm you can either
[1:08:03] speak for God or speak for the enemy.
[1:08:05] But if you're hot, you can only speak
[1:08:06] for God. Amen. So, so, so this is the
[1:08:09] problem now. You know, even if you look
[1:08:11] at like Kora and Dayan, because the
[1:08:13] lukewarm because Satan always comes with
[1:08:14] a lot of truth like Coror and Dayan when
[1:08:17] he w when they withtood Moses, you know,
[1:08:19] they said, "You're not the only holy one
[1:08:21] here. We're all holy." They were right,
[1:08:24] but they were saying it on an angle,
[1:08:26] saying, "Look, you have no authority to
[1:08:28] be leading God's people, but yet God
[1:08:30] ordained him to be the leader." Right?
[1:08:32] So, so there was they were the lukewarm
[1:08:35] ones. Judas. Judas was lukewarm with his
[1:08:39] indignation towards Mary anointing
[1:08:41] Jesus. You see, if you ever hear a
[1:08:43] comment that tries to drag someone down,
[1:08:45] we should encourage one another. Someone
[1:08:48] gets a bit excited and zealous, praise
[1:08:50] God. Amen. Someone wants to, you know,
[1:08:54] we're not wet blankets here. Who likes a
[1:08:57] wet blanket? Who likes a cold, fluffy,
[1:09:00] warm blanket when it's cold, right? We
[1:09:02] all do. Amen. So, we're not here. But
[1:09:04] you see the devil is the biggest wet
[1:09:06] blanket there is. Amen. But we should
[1:09:08] have enough fire around us that whenever
[1:09:11] that wet blanket tries to come along,
[1:09:12] you feel a bit of criticism coming
[1:09:14] towards someone. What are you going to
[1:09:15] do with that?
[1:09:17] You got to identify cuz what is that?
[1:09:19] That thought comes in because something
[1:09:21] wants to use these lips, right? You get
[1:09:23] annoyed at someone. You just have some
[1:09:25] ought, you know, you get even jealousy
[1:09:27] or pride rises up. That's a sure sign
[1:09:29] there's lukewarmness in the camp. When
[1:09:31] there's pride in someone, you know, you
[1:09:33] begin to be annoyed. Some young person
[1:09:35] gets all excited and all enthused. I
[1:09:37] think we should just fan that fire run.
[1:09:40] I mean, you ever seen someone scoring
[1:09:41] like in rugby and someone's doing a big
[1:09:43] run, they're scoring a try and you see
[1:09:45] his teammates running alongside. Not
[1:09:47] that the ball will be past them
[1:09:48] necessarily, but because they're
[1:09:49] cheering on. Go get the try. You can do
[1:09:51] it. We're going to win. Amen. Get the,
[1:09:53] you know, score the points. Amen. We're
[1:09:54] going to get over. Who's ever seen that?
[1:09:56] Who's ever done that? Amen. You see,
[1:09:57] that's how we should be encouraging one
[1:09:59] another. If someone else has got the
[1:10:01] ball, Amen. I'm gonna support that
[1:10:03] player. I'm not going to drag them down.
[1:10:05] They shouldn't be doing that. They're
[1:10:06] too enthused. I don't think we can get
[1:10:08] too enthused. I've never seen someone
[1:10:10] that's too enthused about the Lord. I've
[1:10:12] never seen that. I'd like to see it. See
[1:10:14] what that I I don't think there's a
[1:10:16] scale that you can go, you know, but we
[1:10:19] should never put a dampener on someone
[1:10:21] else's zeal.
[1:10:23] Amen. We should never ever put a, you
[1:10:26] know, try and push someone down who's
[1:10:27] struggling. That is that is a lukewarm
[1:10:30] condition. But the devil will try and
[1:10:32] make you lukewarm by making you look at
[1:10:34] everyone else. Right? But if you're
[1:10:36] looking at the Lord, I say, "How on
[1:10:38] earth can you be
[1:10:41] lukewarm?" Amen. So even even um Peter
[1:10:44] now when you we could read it in Mark 16
[1:10:47] uh Matthew 16 maybe you can turn or not
[1:10:50] but you know Mark 16:21 you know Jesus
[1:10:52] would ask the question or earlier in the
[1:10:54] chapter he'd say who do you say that I
[1:10:56] am or who do they say that I am? And of
[1:10:58] course, the disciples say, "Well, the
[1:11:00] people think you're Jeremiah or Elias or
[1:11:02] one of the prophets." And then, but
[1:11:03] Jesus asked the question, "But who do
[1:11:05] you say that I am?" And who was the one
[1:11:07] who answered, "Thou art the Christ." It
[1:11:08] was Peter, "Thou art the Christ, the son
[1:11:10] of the living God." And then Jesus says
[1:11:12] to Peter, "Blessed art thou, Simon, but
[1:11:14] Jonah, son of Jonah, for flesh and blood
[1:11:16] is not revealed this to you, but my
[1:11:17] father in heaven." Right? And then you
[1:11:19] keep reading down and then Jesus begins
[1:11:22] to show his disciples that he must go to
[1:11:24] Jerusalem, suffer many things. Jesus is
[1:11:26] verse 21 of the elders and chief priests
[1:11:28] and scribes and be killed and raised
[1:11:30] again the third day. But then Peter took
[1:11:32] him be to rebuke him saying be far from
[1:11:35] it thee lord it shall not be unto thee.
[1:11:37] Now Jesus is about to identify the
[1:11:41] inspiration behind what what Peter's
[1:11:43] doing. And he turned and said unto
[1:11:45] Peter, get thee behind me, Satan, for
[1:11:46] thou art an offense unto me.
[1:11:50] So a few verses before this, it's God
[1:11:54] speaking through Peter. You're the
[1:11:56] Christ. Amen. Then a few verses later,
[1:11:59] it's not God speaking anymore. It's
[1:12:01] Satan speaking. Why? Because Peter's in
[1:12:03] a lukewarm condition because he hasn't
[1:12:05] been converted yet. He hasn't gone to
[1:12:08] Pentecost yet. He hasn't got the Holy
[1:12:09] Ghost yet. Amen. But you see now how how
[1:12:13] easily the devil can slip in and use
[1:12:16] your lips to try and stop the word being
[1:12:18] fulfilled. Just like if someone's really
[1:12:21] hungering and thirsting for God, we
[1:12:23] should encourage that. He's there to
[1:12:25] get. The promise is yours. I mean, just
[1:12:27] focus on the blood. Focus on Calvary.
[1:12:28] Just just, you know, he'll fill you with
[1:12:30] the Holy Ghost. You're hungry and
[1:12:31] thirsting after righteousness. You shall
[1:12:33] be filled. Right? That would be God
[1:12:36] speaking to that person. But if we say,
[1:12:37] "No, you're fine. Don't worry about it.
[1:12:39] It's just, you know, you're just going
[1:12:40] through a phase." Who's saying that to
[1:12:42] them?
[1:12:44] It ain't it ain't
[1:12:45] God. So, we got to be very aware how the
[1:12:48] you know, it's like you get into an
[1:12:50] argument with someone. you begin to you
[1:12:52] to disagree and then maybe maybe the
[1:12:55] real kicker comes into your heart to
[1:12:57] say, "Who's that
[1:12:59] speaking? That ain't God. I'm going to
[1:13:02] prove I'm going to prove I'm right." You
[1:13:04] know, you get this ought this, you know,
[1:13:05] what is that's actually lukewarmness.
[1:13:06] That's not hot. Yeah. Because this
[1:13:09] thing, this thing has killed many
[1:13:11] people. The tongue. Life and death is in
[1:13:13] the power of the tongue. But who you
[1:13:15] going to surrender it to? You say, "But
[1:13:17] I get angry. I get annoyed. I get, you
[1:13:19] know, people rub me up the wrong way.
[1:13:21] It's because you're human and iron is
[1:13:23] sharpening iron. God has allowed that
[1:13:26] person. You know, you can have someone
[1:13:27] come into a church that you just
[1:13:29] disagree with. You can't even put up
[1:13:31] with them. God brought them here for
[1:13:34] you.
[1:13:36] God needs to rub certain things. God
[1:13:38] allows situations to come in cuz he
[1:13:41] needs to shave you down a bit. He needs
[1:13:42] you to come to a certain, you know,
[1:13:44] praise God. But do we see it that way? I
[1:13:47] say, "Oh, that person dechristianize
[1:13:49] them, run them down, all these things."
[1:13:51] Who's doing that? Who who are you being
[1:13:53] a mouthpiece for? Let's be a mouthpiece
[1:13:56] for the
[1:13:58] Lord. Amen.
[1:14:01] You know, even even
[1:14:03] where someone who's lukewarm, they
[1:14:07] will they
[1:14:09] will wait, let's just read this. Sorry.
[1:14:11] Because you say, "Well, what is this
[1:14:12] lukewarmness? What is the what is the uh
[1:14:16] problem behind it?" because it's more
[1:14:17] than just being indifferent. But where
[1:14:19] we read in Revelations chapter 3, I will
[1:14:21] because thou are lukewarm, I'll spew
[1:14:23] thee out of thy mouth. Spw thee out of
[1:14:25] my mouth. Right now, this doesn't speak
[1:14:28] about that you're no longer saved. Okay,
[1:14:31] I'm just going to read this from the
[1:14:32] church age book because so I'm okay. He
[1:14:34] says, we're going to look carefully at
[1:14:35] this as brother saying. It says this,
[1:14:36] and the lady church age group is
[1:14:38] lukewarm. This lukewarmness demands a
[1:14:40] penalty from God. The penalty is that
[1:14:42] they they will be spewed out of his
[1:14:44] mouth. Here is where you don't want to
[1:14:46] go astray as a lot of folks do. They
[1:14:48] very unwisely say that God can spew you
[1:14:50] out of his mouth. That proves there's no
[1:14:52] such thing as any truth to the doctrine
[1:14:54] of the perseverance of saints. I want to
[1:14:56] correct your thinking right now. This
[1:14:58] verse is not given to an individual.
[1:15:00] It's given to the church. He is talking
[1:15:02] to the church. Furthermore, if you will
[1:15:04] just keep the word in mind, you you will
[1:15:06] recall that nowhere does it say that we
[1:15:09] are in the mouth of God. We're engraved
[1:15:11] in his palms. We're carried in his bosom
[1:15:13] way back in the unknown ages before
[1:15:15] time. We're in his mind. We are in his
[1:15:17] sheepfold and in his pastures, but never
[1:15:19] in his mouth. What is in the mouth of
[1:15:21] the Lord? The word is in his mouth.
[1:15:23] Matthew 4:4. But he answered s them,
[1:15:25] "Man shall not live by word uh bread
[1:15:27] alone, sorry, but every word that
[1:15:29] proceeds out of the mouth of God." The
[1:15:31] word is supposed to be in our mouths
[1:15:33] too. Now, now we know that the church is
[1:15:36] his body. It is here taking his place.
[1:15:39] What will be in the mouth of the church?
[1:15:41] the word. He says in 1 Peter 4:11, "If
[1:15:43] any man speak, let him speak as the
[1:15:45] oracles, the word of God." 2 Peter 2:21,
[1:15:47] "For prophecy came not in old time by
[1:15:50] the will of man." But holy men of God
[1:15:52] spake as are moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:55] That is uh then what is wrong with these
[1:15:57] people in the last day. They've gotten
[1:15:58] away from the word. They're no longer
[1:16:00] fervent about it. They are lukewarm
[1:16:02] about it. He says, "I'm going to prove
[1:16:04] it right now. The Baptists have their
[1:16:05] creeds and dogmas based on the word. You
[1:16:07] can't shake them. They said the
[1:16:08] apostolic days of miracles are over.
[1:16:10] There's no baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:12] subsequent to believing. The Methodists
[1:16:15] say based on the word there's no water
[1:16:16] baptism. Sprinkling is not baptism. And
[1:16:19] that sanctification is the baptism with
[1:16:21] the Holy Ghost. The Church of Christ
[1:16:23] majors in regenerational baptism. In all
[1:16:25] too many cases they go down dry sinners,
[1:16:27] come up wet once. Yet they claim their
[1:16:29] doctrine is word-based. Go right down
[1:16:31] the line. Come to the Pentecostals. Do
[1:16:33] they have the word? Give them the word.
[1:16:34] Test and see. They'll sell out the word
[1:16:36] for a sensation. just every uh just
[1:16:38] about every time if you can produce a
[1:16:40] manifestation like oil and blood and
[1:16:42] tongues and other signs whether in the
[1:16:44] word or not or whether properly
[1:16:46] interpreted from the word the majority
[1:16:48] will fall for it but what has happened
[1:16:49] to the word it has been put aside so God
[1:16:52] says I'm going against you all I'll spew
[1:16:54] you out of my mouth this is the end for
[1:16:56] seven out of I mean for seven out of
[1:16:58] seven ages I've seen nothing but men
[1:17:00] esteeming their own word above mine and
[1:17:03] I say when you put your own feelings
[1:17:06] thoughts above the word. What are you
[1:17:08] doing? You're laying the word aside. You
[1:17:11] say, "I've really got to ball this
[1:17:12] person out. Is that edifying? Is that
[1:17:14] speaking the truth in
[1:17:16] love?" No. Well, what are you doing?
[1:17:18] You're you're actually putting the word
[1:17:19] aside and letting and actually taking
[1:17:21] your own thoughts or creeds, you know,
[1:17:24] and making that your number one. I know
[1:17:26] we've gone very quiet. That's okay. You
[1:17:28] see, but you got to realize now we don't
[1:17:30] want to become lukewarm. The word should
[1:17:32] rule in every situation. The word is
[1:17:35] always right. No matter how I feel, if
[1:17:37] my feelings are against the word, I'm
[1:17:39] going to go with the word. Amen. If my
[1:17:41] imagination is is against the word, I'm
[1:17:43] going to go against the word. Amen. So
[1:17:45] imagination comes, I'll never have
[1:17:47] victory. Or thoughts come, I'll never
[1:17:48] have victory. I'll never overcome. I
[1:17:51] just have to be this way for the rest of
[1:17:52] my life because of something I did.
[1:17:54] That's contrary to the word. Amen. Why?
[1:17:56] Because we're new creations in Christ
[1:17:58] Jesus. Amen. You know, there's nothing
[1:18:00] there's nothing the blood cannot atone
[1:18:01] for. You say, "Well, my past and what I
[1:18:03] did, you're imagining or your memory is
[1:18:06] actually ruling above the word." You got
[1:18:08] to put that memory to one side and say,
[1:18:10] "No, I take that memory to Calvary."
[1:18:12] Amen. Crucify it. Amen. Say, "Lord, you
[1:18:14] have redeem me. I'm your child." And
[1:18:16] walk on with God.
[1:18:19] Amen. You say, "Well, we can never mend
[1:18:21] a friendship." Yeah, you can. We were
[1:18:24] enemies of God once. He mended more than
[1:18:26] a friendship. Are you with me? Amen. So
[1:18:28] never ever let but if you take those
[1:18:30] things you say well there's no place for
[1:18:32] the gifts anymore really there's no
[1:18:35] place for the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] anymore really we don't need shouting no
[1:18:39] more
[1:18:40] really don't take things that now we're
[1:18:43] not called to become cold and formal
[1:18:45] that's right amen we come to become on
[1:18:48] fire with God now the manifestation is
[1:18:50] that it's how God has made us right but
[1:18:52] we should never ever think that well now
[1:18:54] we just mature and settled down and God
[1:18:57] don't do those things No more. Really?
[1:18:59] Are you sure? That's a creed exalting
[1:19:02] itself above the word of God. Because if
[1:19:04] you have the giver, he'll do whatever he
[1:19:06] wants. Amen. If he wants to shout
[1:19:07] through through you, let him shout. If
[1:19:09] he wants to praise through you and run
[1:19:11] the aisles, let him do it. Don't be
[1:19:13] Don't Don't restrict what God wants to
[1:19:15] do in your life. Amen. If he calls you,
[1:19:17] lead you to pray for someone, do it. Go
[1:19:20] witness to someone, do it. Amen. Don't
[1:19:22] don't don't restrict God. You say,
[1:19:24] "Well, I don't have the words, but you
[1:19:25] got a testimony." Amen. You've got the
[1:19:27] proof that it works, do you not? Amen.
[1:19:29] You can say, "Well, I know where I was
[1:19:31] when God found me. This is what he did.
[1:19:32] This is Praise the Lord. This message
[1:19:35] works."
[1:19:37] Amen. So, we don't want to esteem our
[1:19:39] be, you know, we don't want to esteem
[1:19:41] our own thoughts above the word of God.
[1:19:42] We want to be God's mouthpiece. I don't
[1:19:45] want to be my own mouthpiece. I don't
[1:19:47] want to speak for the devil. That's for
[1:19:48] sure. I don't want to speak my own
[1:19:50] opinions. I don't want to be lukewarm
[1:19:51] where where the devil can step in and
[1:19:53] God can step in and all these things.
[1:19:54] No, I want to be on fire for God. You
[1:19:56] see even you see even Peter himself
[1:19:58] after Pentecost because I was thinking
[1:20:00] many people will take Mark 16 and say
[1:20:02] well that was before Pentecost so things
[1:20:03] are different. No after Pentecost Peter
[1:20:06] got
[1:20:07] lukewarm because he got to a point where
[1:20:10] the Apostle Paul would speak about it
[1:20:13] where where the Apostle Paul would I
[1:20:16] mean sorry Peter when when he was in
[1:20:18] Antioch he be to separate himself from
[1:20:21] the Gentile believers and only and only
[1:20:24] eat with the Jewish believers. Now, the
[1:20:26] reason he did this is because some
[1:20:28] believers came from from um from
[1:20:30] Jerusalem and then he be to so so what
[1:20:33] happened was he be to think or care
[1:20:35] about more what man thought of him than
[1:20:37] what God thought of him. Because here's
[1:20:40] the man now you think about this. Here's
[1:20:41] the man who you know if you if we go
[1:20:44] back to Acts chapter 10, he's in Japer.
[1:20:46] He's on the roof of the house. He has a
[1:20:49] vision of a sheet coming down from
[1:20:50] heaven with all these unclean beasts in
[1:20:52] it. And God would tell him, "Slay and
[1:20:54] eat." and it'll go back and come back
[1:20:56] down. Right? He says, you know, but but
[1:20:58] Lord, I've never, you know, I'm I've
[1:21:00] never eaten anything like that. I've
[1:21:02] always eaten things which are which are
[1:21:03] right, right? Which are clean. And God
[1:21:06] told him, don't call that which is
[1:21:08] common and unclean what I have made
[1:21:10] clean. And then when the vision left and
[1:21:11] then there was a knock on the front
[1:21:13] door, men were coming from Cornelius's
[1:21:15] house, a gentile calling him because an
[1:21:18] angel of God had already spoken to
[1:21:19] Cornelius telling him to send men to
[1:21:21] Jopa to Peter and he'll come and speak
[1:21:23] the words of life. So now after this
[1:21:25] vision now Peter Peter receives the
[1:21:28] revelation of it that God has cleansed
[1:21:31] the Gentiles. Amen. So he has this
[1:21:34] vision. He goes to Cornelius's house. He
[1:21:36] begins to preach the word to them. And
[1:21:38] while he's preaching, amen, the Holy
[1:21:40] Ghost falls upon everyone in Cornelius's
[1:21:42] house. They're baptized in the name of
[1:21:43] the Lord. And what's happened? The door
[1:21:45] has opened to the Gentiles. Amen. But
[1:21:48] you see what happened. So, so he was he
[1:21:50] was he put the word above. So that
[1:21:53] vision was the word, right? He put that
[1:21:55] above his previous what he thought.
[1:21:57] Amen. But then now it comes years down
[1:21:59] the road, he's in Antioch. And because
[1:22:01] of believers that have come from
[1:22:02] Jerusalem, he be, you know, who are
[1:22:04] Jewish, he begins to worry about what
[1:22:05] they will think of him. and he begins to
[1:22:08] separate himself. I say what he came
[1:22:11] lukewarm
[1:22:12] because those actions weren't the
[1:22:14] actions of God that we're one body. No,
[1:22:18] it was actually the
[1:22:20] actions of the enemy trying to bring
[1:22:24] division. What happened? He became
[1:22:27] lukewarm. And even Barnabas and other
[1:22:29] ones were were all caught up in it. But
[1:22:32] then when Paul went to him and and and
[1:22:34] and publicly begin to speak to speak to
[1:22:37] him about it, he be to realize Peter be
[1:22:39] to realize I'm wrong. What happened? He
[1:22:42] became hot again. So we got to be very
[1:22:44] careful. God can show us something very
[1:22:46] powerful in the word. Amen. And but you
[1:22:49] say, well, you know, he can show us
[1:22:51] something very powerful. You got to live
[1:22:52] true to that. You got to live true to
[1:22:54] that because what Peter saw that vision
[1:22:56] was according to the scripture because
[1:22:58] out of the Gentiles, he call the people
[1:22:59] for his name's sake. rises all according
[1:23:02] to the word. But you see, Peter became
[1:23:03] lukewarm. He He went from hot to
[1:23:05] lukewarm, but then back to hot
[1:23:08] again.
[1:23:10] Amen. Now, we've talked about the
[1:23:12] lukewarm ones, I think. Are we done?
[1:23:14] We're done with them. We're done with
[1:23:15] the cold. Now, let's talk about the hot.
[1:23:18] Let's talk about the hot. Amen. Because
[1:23:19] that's what we want to be. Amen. Where
[1:23:21] we don't want we don't want to become
[1:23:23] lukewarm or stay lukewarm. Because you
[1:23:25] know a lukewarm can be well back in my
[1:23:28] early walk with God yes things were
[1:23:30] different but now things have changed.
[1:23:32] It should be the same. It should be the
[1:23:34] same. Amen. There'll be times when we
[1:23:36] come lukewarm
[1:23:38] just like Peter did. But doesn't mean
[1:23:40] we'll stay lukewarm cuz God wants to
[1:23:42] break the cycle of revival and death.
[1:23:44] Amen. He wants to break that cycle. He's
[1:23:46] going to break that cycle in this age.
[1:23:48] Who's he going to use? You. He's going
[1:23:50] to use the bride around the world to
[1:23:52] say, "Hey, you're on fire once, but I'm
[1:23:54] going to fan that fire again." Amen. You
[1:23:55] say, "Well, I'm just a smoking flax. I'm
[1:23:58] just barely there, but but the Lord
[1:24:00] said, "A smoking flax I will not
[1:24:02] quench." He's going to blow on that
[1:24:04] thing. He's going to set your candle of
[1:24:06] flame again. Amen. Where where where the
[1:24:09] Lord says this, he says this, well, this
[1:24:11] is an Ephesian church age. He says, he
[1:24:13] says, "Now, but these he says, now the
[1:24:15] original fire has died down." Okay?
[1:24:17] They're not the same anymore. with the
[1:24:18] fervent desire to please God, the
[1:24:20] passion to know his word, the cry for
[1:24:22] reaching out the spirit all begins to
[1:24:24] fade and instead of that church being on
[1:24:26] fire with the fire of God, it has cooled
[1:24:27] off and become a bit formal. So let's
[1:24:29] change that around now. I mean the
[1:24:30] fervent desire to please God, the
[1:24:32] passion to know his word, the cry for
[1:24:34] the reaching out of the spirit has got
[1:24:35] stronger.
[1:24:37] This is the hot. I want more of you,
[1:24:39] Lord. I want you to live, Lord. Lord, I
[1:24:42] don't want to be once upon a time I was
[1:24:44] the mouthpiece for the devil. I spoke
[1:24:47] cursing. I spoke unbelief. I I spoke
[1:24:50] doubt. I spoke division. I spoke
[1:24:52] trouble. I spoke circumstances, complex
[1:24:55] spheres of pain. This all came out of
[1:24:57] here. Amen. But then God came along. I
[1:25:00] just think friends, if we could really
[1:25:01] look at Calvary and what he done, how
[1:25:02] can we stay lukewarm? That's really what
[1:25:04] I got out of this whole thing. Amen.
[1:25:06] Because you think about once upon a time
[1:25:08] this this these vocal cords brought a
[1:25:10] lot of death and a lot of harm and a lot
[1:25:13] of hurt. But then God, goodness and
[1:25:15] mercy of God was on my trail. Amen. He
[1:25:18] came searching for me. Amen. Because he
[1:25:20] because he ordained me not to be the
[1:25:21] mouthpiece of the devil. No, he he
[1:25:24] didn't even make me to be the mouthpiece
[1:25:25] of myself, but he made me to be the
[1:25:27] mouthpiece of a of almighty God. I mean
[1:25:30] that God by the power of his blood would
[1:25:32] cleanse a human soul, cleanse a human
[1:25:34] spirit. that these same vocal cords,
[1:25:36] amen, God would speak life and he'd
[1:25:39] speak truth and he'd speak redemption
[1:25:41] and he'd speak healing and he'd speak
[1:25:43] encouragement. Amen. That's what God has
[1:25:45] done for you. You once a you were once
[1:25:47] here to build Satan's kingdom, but then
[1:25:49] God got a hold of you and God wants to
[1:25:51] use your life to tear Satan's kingdom
[1:25:54] down.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah. Amen. Well, how what do you
[1:25:58] mean? the kingdom that Satan has built
[1:26:00] up in the lives of men and women.
[1:26:02] Complexes, strongholds, hurts, unbelief,
[1:26:05] pain. Amen. God wants to use your lips
[1:26:08] to demolish Satan's kingdom in their
[1:26:10] lives. Amen. That the word of God would
[1:26:12] put on flesh in you and I. And God would
[1:26:14] speak. Amen. God would God would live.
[1:26:16] God would love. God would care through
[1:26:19] human beings. Hallelujah.
[1:26:23] Amen. You think about
[1:26:26] now what has he done? He's put the voice
[1:26:30] of God in the bride. Once again, brother
[1:26:33] Ram says in this day that the voice of
[1:26:35] God is in her. Yes, it is. And he said
[1:26:37] he said that the once more the world
[1:26:39] will hear direct from God as at
[1:26:41] Pentecost. This is this day. You got to
[1:26:44] realize when God, who's ever had
[1:26:45] something, you speaking to someone and
[1:26:47] it's like words just fill your mouth and
[1:26:49] it's it's him and the prince of God
[1:26:52] drops into the room. God begins to work.
[1:26:54] What is that? That is that person
[1:26:56] hearing from God.
[1:26:59] Amen. That is hear that is the world
[1:27:00] hearing from God like they did at
[1:27:02] Pentecost.
[1:27:04] You say, "Well, I can't I'm not a
[1:27:06] preacher." That's got nothing to do with
[1:27:08] it. I'm not a singer. I I'm not
[1:27:10] charismatic. I can't put words together
[1:27:12] very well. That has got nothing to do
[1:27:14] with it. Amen. God will anoint you for a
[1:27:16] word in season and it's not you trying
[1:27:18] to imagine something to say or you know
[1:27:21] something about the person. So you say
[1:27:23] this like this and I feel this. No, it's
[1:27:25] God takes over and speaks. You're not
[1:27:27] even conscious of what's coming out.
[1:27:30] Amen.
[1:27:31] I know it's true. I know it's happened.
[1:27:34] God wants to use us in everyday
[1:27:36] situations like that. Amen. People may
[1:27:38] never come through these doors, but God
[1:27:40] can still minister to them through your
[1:27:41] life.
[1:27:43] Hallelujah.
[1:27:45] Amen. Hallelujah. Burning hot, fully
[1:27:49] surrendered like brother Ed preached on
[1:27:51] Wednesday. Completely sold out. Their
[1:27:53] main desire is for the Lord to live.
[1:27:55] Amen. To walk and talk through them.
[1:27:57] Amen. They want to please him. Not to
[1:27:59] earn salvation or to earn anything, but
[1:28:01] they know what he has already done for
[1:28:02] them on Calvary. Amen. They're not
[1:28:04] interested in rewards. They just want to
[1:28:06] live for him. Amen. They know his
[1:28:08] amazing grace. Amen. That's those who
[1:28:09] are on hot. Amen. You remember where he
[1:28:11] found you. I probably say it every
[1:28:13] service, but remember where he found
[1:28:15] you. I think sometimes we're going,
[1:28:16] Brother Bram said, go back in thought
[1:28:17] and then back in reality. Amen. If
[1:28:20] you're lukewarm, go back in thought to
[1:28:21] where he found you. The feelings you
[1:28:23] had, the joy and elation, thanksgiving
[1:28:25] you had. Go back in thought. Then step
[1:28:27] back in reality. Amen. Because if you're
[1:28:29] thinking all the time, "Well, the
[1:28:31] season's different. I'm cold. I'm
[1:28:32] mature. This has happened. Trouble's too
[1:28:34] much." You'll never go back in reality.
[1:28:37] Begin to but but go back and thought
[1:28:38] where God found you. What he's done for
[1:28:40] you. Amen. He didn't give you just a
[1:28:42] one-time experience. No, he stepped into
[1:28:43] your life to walk through you. Amen. To
[1:28:46] prove his word through you. Amen. Praise
[1:28:49] the Lord. Amen. They know it's all him.
[1:28:53] Those who are burning red hot are not
[1:28:54] writing emotion. They're writing
[1:28:57] revelation.
[1:28:59] Amen. We're not We're not just going
[1:29:00] from emotion to emotion. No, it's far
[1:29:03] deeper than that. I know where I I know
[1:29:05] who I am. I know where You say, "Well,
[1:29:06] you get a bit emotional." Of of course I
[1:29:08] get emotional. He saved my soul. I'm not
[1:29:11] on death row anymore. Amen. My
[1:29:13] destination is secure. I know where I'm
[1:29:15] going. Hallelujah. I know there's a body
[1:29:18] change waiting for me. I know it's
[1:29:20] already happening on the inside. Amen. I
[1:29:22] know I'm like Enoch. I'm walking with
[1:29:24] God. Why? Because God called me to walk
[1:29:26] with him. I say, "Lord, it's the
[1:29:27] greatest privilege." Amen. Like brother
[1:29:29] Bram there in Colorado mountains in that
[1:29:31] storm and God begins to speak to him.
[1:29:33] I'm the God of creation. He says, "Will
[1:29:36] you walk with me?" Brother said, "That's
[1:29:39] the greatest joy I could ever have."
[1:29:41] And the storm.
[1:29:43] Hallelujah. God allows storms to come
[1:29:45] into your life. But he's actually
[1:29:46] asking, "Will you walk with me?" He
[1:29:49] said, "How can I ever be that way?" Just
[1:29:50] walk with him. Say, "Yes, Lord. Here I
[1:29:53] come." Amen. And brother Ram says that a
[1:29:56] man fully surrendered to God is
[1:29:58] omnipotent or all
[1:29:59] powerful. Amen. You see he says he says
[1:30:02] man is omnipotent. You don't believe it
[1:30:04] but he is a man fully surrendered to God
[1:30:05] is omnipotent. Did he not say in Mark
[1:30:07] 11:22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:30:09] don't doubt in your heart it will come
[1:30:11] to pass you can have what you've said.
[1:30:13] Amen. So someone's just on fire for God
[1:30:15] just loves the Lord. God can use their
[1:30:18] vocals. Lord whatever you want Lord.
[1:30:20] Amen. It's like prayer. What is really
[1:30:21] prayer? It's not us praying. It's him
[1:30:23] praying through us. the spirit, you
[1:30:25] know, you just get into a channel.
[1:30:26] Sometimes it's like you're like laboring
[1:30:28] along in prayer. Those are fine, too.
[1:30:30] But, you know, sometimes a channel just
[1:30:31] opens up and just words come out. You
[1:30:34] say, "Who was that? That was him praying
[1:30:36] through you." Amen. Hallelujah. You got
[1:30:39] to, you know, like the thing is we got
[1:30:40] to
[1:30:42] we we just got to keep walking with God.
[1:30:44] So, I was going to go segueing, but I'm
[1:30:46] going to stay with this. He says he
[1:30:47] says, "Whatsoever things you say, don't
[1:30:49] doubt in your heart. It will come to
[1:30:50] pass. You can have what you've said."
[1:30:51] Did he not say in Mark 9:23, Jesus said
[1:30:54] unto them, "If thou canst believe, all
[1:30:56] things are possible to him that
[1:30:57] believe." If you can believe, you say,
[1:30:59] "Lord, increase my faith, Lord." Use use
[1:31:02] these lips. May I be your mouthpiece,
[1:31:03] Lord Jesus. All things are possible.
[1:31:06] Amen. What happens when two omnipotent
[1:31:09] meet? When God and man comes together,
[1:31:11] two omnipotent meet, something's got to
[1:31:14] shake. Something's got to happen.
[1:31:17] Amen. Amen. Whatever you you'd say with
[1:31:20] that creative power, the omnipotence of
[1:31:22] God, knowing that he's promised it, and
[1:31:24] he said it in his word, it creates a
[1:31:25] power that goes out yonder and brings
[1:31:27] things to pass, things that is not, it
[1:31:29] makes them as though they are because
[1:31:31] two omnipotents have met. Amen. There he
[1:31:33] stands. Oh my, isn't he
[1:31:35] wonderful? I know you've seen it
[1:31:38] happen. I'm not going to give any
[1:31:40] examples right now. I just want to say I
[1:31:41] know you've seen it happen. Amen. Where
[1:31:43] God, you a peace, you pray and a peace
[1:31:46] comes, you know it's done. And then you
[1:31:48] begin to come see it come into
[1:31:49] manifestation and you just rejoice in
[1:31:51] that. Well, what's happened? There's a
[1:31:53] creative power that that that stepped
[1:31:54] into your mouth, spoke out. Amen. And
[1:31:56] even the word says in Romans chapter 11,
[1:31:59] it says, "What does faith say?" Do I
[1:32:01] need to call him from above or call him
[1:32:02] from below? He says, "No, what does
[1:32:05] faith say?" It says, "The word is
[1:32:06] neither even in thy mouth and in thy
[1:32:08] heart." That is the word of faith which
[1:32:10] we preach. Amen. So, it's already within
[1:32:12] you. Amen.
[1:32:15] You know, brother Ram says, you know, we
[1:32:16] often marvel at the word of God being a
[1:32:18] discerner of the thoughts intents of the
[1:32:20] heart, aren't we? You know, we come to a
[1:32:22] service and it's like the preachers just
[1:32:23] been in our car, right? Been around the
[1:32:25] kitchen table, been with us yesterday,
[1:32:28] been on the phone with us. You know what
[1:32:30] is that? That's the word of God being a
[1:32:31] discerner of the thoughts intents of the
[1:32:33] heart, right? And often we think, man,
[1:32:35] that's amazing. But you know that God
[1:32:37] wants to do that in everyday life with
[1:32:40] you. Amen. Because brother Ram says that
[1:32:43] he says in Christ the mystery God
[1:32:44] revealed. He says when that word has
[1:32:46] preminence in the man the same thing
[1:32:48] takes place again for it is the word.
[1:32:51] Amen. So so when he's number one when
[1:32:53] you're hot for God you're not lukewarm
[1:32:56] or cold but you're fiery hot enjoying
[1:32:58] God loving him with all your heart fully
[1:33:00] surrendered then God can step in and you
[1:33:02] can have a conversation with someone and
[1:33:04] it's like you know their history you
[1:33:06] know their address. You know everything
[1:33:07] they're going through and you have no
[1:33:08] idea what's going on. Why? because he
[1:33:10] has preminence. God has preminence in
[1:33:12] your life. Amen. I'm just throwing these
[1:33:15] things out here because I realize, yo,
[1:33:16] you got to realize you're a very
[1:33:18] powerful people. Amen. You have a very p
[1:33:21] you are very powerful. Actually, there's
[1:33:23] unlimited the power within you is
[1:33:26] unlimited in its ability, its potency,
[1:33:29] and its strength because it's the word
[1:33:32] himself. Amen. The blood puts us back on
[1:33:34] speaking terms. I think how can anyone
[1:33:36] be lukewarm when you look at that?
[1:33:37] Brother Bram says about the lamb taking
[1:33:39] the book. He says, "Doesn't that want to
[1:33:41] make you go into the corner and cry cry
[1:33:43] a while?" Amen. To see to see our Lord
[1:33:46] Jesus come and step forth and he says
[1:33:48] it's the most sublime act in in in all
[1:33:50] of scripture, the lamb taking the book.
[1:33:52] I think, man, if you could, you know, if
[1:33:53] we could just look again like the thief
[1:33:55] did on the cross and see our lamb
[1:33:57] hanging there, how could we how could we
[1:33:59] ever be lukewarm? Amen. Because the
[1:34:01] blood of blood of Jesus Christ puts us
[1:34:03] in speaking terms. It puts us in
[1:34:05] condition. Amen. That we can talk. Amen.
[1:34:08] You know, we can talk to God and God can
[1:34:10] talk back to us. I think my how how
[1:34:12] powerful it is. I'm going to close soon
[1:34:13] with this. Okay? So, we'll be okay. You
[1:34:15] see, isn't it an incredible thing? You
[1:34:16] think how on earth could we could we
[1:34:19] remain lukewarm? We want our ideas, our
[1:34:21] opinions, our thoughts ruling when you
[1:34:23] just look at what he has
[1:34:25] done. Amen. You know, the blood of Jesus
[1:34:27] Christ has cleansed us back to
[1:34:28] everything Adam lost is now in our
[1:34:31] possession. Everything. Authority over
[1:34:33] nature. authority over the devil. Amen.
[1:34:36] Placing as the sons and daughters of
[1:34:37] God, the blood has cleansed us back into
[1:34:39] that condition. Like I said a while ago,
[1:34:41] if Moses under the blood of bulls and
[1:34:43] goats could do what he did as a and he
[1:34:45] was a fulfillment of prophecy, how much
[1:34:47] more you and I under the blood of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ. Amen. We have been restored
[1:34:52] back, amen, to what Adam lost. And but
[1:34:55] yet we're still in these bodies to prove
[1:34:57] the blood of Jesus Christ gives us
[1:34:59] victory in these fallen bodies.
[1:35:02] Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] People say, "If only I was in Adam's
[1:35:05] condition." We're in actually a better
[1:35:07] condition than Adam. Because God has
[1:35:10] sealed us the day of our redemption that
[1:35:11] we can never fall. But Adam could fall
[1:35:13] in the garden. We can't fall in Satan's
[1:35:16] Eden.
[1:35:18] Amen. God has anointed us to tear
[1:35:20] Satan's kingdom down. God wants to use
[1:35:23] your voice to bring salvation to people.
[1:35:26] Amen. You can impart eternal life.
[1:35:28] Brother, brother says, "A son of God can
[1:35:31] impart eternal life through your lips,
[1:35:34] not by a preconceived idea, but God
[1:35:36] wants to use your vocal
[1:35:39] cords." Amen. He said, he said, "When a
[1:35:43] spiritborn, spiritfilled man takes the
[1:35:45] word and faith into his heart and place
[1:35:47] it upon his lips, why it's the same as
[1:35:50] deity speaking, every mountain has to
[1:35:51] go. Satan cannot stand before that man."
[1:35:54] That's you he's talking about.
[1:35:57] Amen. Because remember Peter, Peter,
[1:36:00] remember what it was like to be hot and
[1:36:01] he went back to that condition. I'm just
[1:36:04] going to close with this. Maybe it's
[1:36:05] kind of the service has gone gone this,
[1:36:07] but I just want to talk to you
[1:36:08] individually
[1:36:09] now. Whose mouthpiece are you this
[1:36:13] morning? Are you cold? You just
[1:36:15] indifferent? Are you lukewarm where it's
[1:36:18] a lot of truth, but it's the devil
[1:36:19] wrapped up to tear people down? Or are
[1:36:22] you hot? Has your life got a track
[1:36:26] record of building people up
[1:36:28] irrespective of of temperament? You say,
[1:36:31] "I'm just built this way. I'm just I'm
[1:36:32] just highrung. I'm hideered." All these
[1:36:34] things. That's got nothing to do with
[1:36:36] it. No, we should have the if you're
[1:36:39] dead, it's Christ
[1:36:41] living. Amen. So, we can't blame our
[1:36:43] temperament on our actions. No. What
[1:36:45] happens? The lukewarmness comes. Pride
[1:36:47] comes in and we think people just get
[1:36:49] Yeah. We got to be careful when people
[1:36:50] say, "Well, I've just got righteous
[1:36:52] indignation.
[1:36:54] Are you sure it's that?
[1:36:57] Cuz many times it's just someone being
[1:36:59] grumpy, someone being angry, and the
[1:37:01] devil steps into that and causes a lot
[1:37:03] of damage.
[1:37:05] We shouldn't be like
[1:37:06] that. You what is your life
[1:37:09] producing? Peter's life when it was hot,
[1:37:12] miracles happened, salvation came,
[1:37:15] healing happened, the dead were raised,
[1:37:17] the body was edified. You say, "I'm not
[1:37:19] an apostle." But we're all here to build
[1:37:21] up one another.
[1:37:23] Right? So what is the track record? We
[1:37:25] say, "Well, once upon a time, I loved
[1:37:27] him with all my heart and he was more
[1:37:30] than life to me and he meant everything
[1:37:32] to me and all I cared about was serving
[1:37:34] him and living with him. You're hot."
[1:37:38] But now things have changed and I've
[1:37:40] gotten older and there's problems and
[1:37:41] life is a lot more complex and harder
[1:37:43] and I just can't be that way anymore.
[1:37:45] Who said?
[1:37:47] Who said? You say, "Well, I can't come
[1:37:49] back to what I was." Who said?
[1:37:52] The Lord has made a way of escape.
[1:37:55] Amen. So why not let him reignite that
[1:37:58] flame again? Why not fall in love with
[1:38:01] Jesus Christ one more time? Amen. Cuz
[1:38:04] that's what it means to be on hot.
[1:38:05] You're in love. You're having a love
[1:38:07] affair with you and the Lord. Amen. All
[1:38:09] you want to do is live for him, please
[1:38:11] him. Why? To get to heaven? No.
[1:38:12] Absolutely not. You know he's purchased
[1:38:14] your salvation. Amen. But you just love
[1:38:16] him more than anything in this world.
[1:38:18] You see someone who's happy, it's
[1:38:20] infectious.
[1:38:21] You see someone grumpy, that's a
[1:38:23] disease. It's infectious, too. So, what
[1:38:27] is your You say, "Well, I'm not a bubbly
[1:38:29] personality, but with the Lord, you can
[1:38:31] have an atmosphere around you." You can
[1:38:33] be a person of few words. I've met
[1:38:34] people of few words. I've met believers
[1:38:36] who I can't even speak their language,
[1:38:38] but there's an atmosphere around them.
[1:38:40] You feel so at home. Hallelujah. You can
[1:38:43] just speak a few words, maybe together,
[1:38:44] maybe some pigeon or whatever. Not even
[1:38:46] that. I don't know. But you Who's ever
[1:38:48] been in that situation? Yeah. I remember
[1:38:50] being in being in Chile being with
[1:38:53] believers. I can't speak their lang. I
[1:38:54] can't speak Spanish. They can't speak
[1:38:56] English. But just being around them
[1:38:58] said, "Man, this is this is a brother.
[1:39:00] This is a sister." It's like you there's
[1:39:01] such a connection and you feel so at
[1:39:03] home. You feel at peace. So it's more
[1:39:06] than just what you say. No, it's it's
[1:39:07] the atmosphere you carry. So someone
[1:39:10] who's who's cold carries a cold
[1:39:12] atmosphere. Indifferent. Who cares? This
[1:39:14] is boring. Can we have lunch? Let's go
[1:39:15] home. Okay. Someone who's lukewarm.
[1:39:17] Yeah. Kind of speaks to me. Yeah.
[1:39:19] Whatever. whatever, you know, up and
[1:39:21] down, left and right, but someone who's
[1:39:23] hot, they love him. There's a love, the
[1:39:26] love of God permeates out of their
[1:39:29] life. So, let's have the musicians this
[1:39:31] morning. I'm just going to leave it with
[1:39:33] that. We can be on fire. We can have
[1:39:37] that same first
[1:39:39] love and it's here to have.
[1:39:43] Amen. So, why not be on Why not be hot?
[1:39:46] Why not be God's mouthpiece?
[1:39:49] Isn't that incredible? The creator of
[1:39:50] heavens and earth can step into you and
[1:39:52] change someone's
[1:39:54] life. Amen. That's a powerful thing. So
[1:39:58] why not let him say, "Lord, I want to be
[1:40:01] your mouthpiece from now and forever
[1:40:03] more." If I get feel a bit lukewarmness,
[1:40:05] if a pride steps in an order and anger,
[1:40:08] Lord, may I not carry that thing and and
[1:40:10] and allow it to drag me into a
[1:40:11] lukewarmness where I care more about me
[1:40:14] being right and them wrong and me
[1:40:16] pushing them down and me proving my
[1:40:17] point. May I slip away, Lord, and pray
[1:40:19] for that person because they're going
[1:40:21] through something and they need your
[1:40:22] help, Lord. That's someone who's
[1:40:24] actually hot. They take it to the
[1:40:27] Lord. Let's be that way, shall we? Let's
[1:40:31] stand. Amen.
[1:40:33] [Applause]
[1:40:37] Amen. I need a song.
[1:40:43] Amen. Sure. Change my heart, oh Lord.
[1:40:46] Make it ever
[1:40:52] true. Amen. Let's worship the Lord this
[1:40:54] morning. Amen. Let's raise our hands and
[1:40:56] say, "Lord, I want to be Let's pray
[1:40:57] before we sing, shall we? Do you want to
[1:40:59] dedicate yourself to the Lord?
[1:41:00] Rededicate yourself to the Lord. Say,
[1:41:02] "Lord, you know, I've raised both my
[1:41:04] hands. I don't want to be a lukewarm
[1:41:06] Christian. I don't want to be negative.
[1:41:07] I be full of God's love and zeal and
[1:41:10] fire and Amen. God bless you all that
[1:41:12] have raised your hands." Amen. Let's
[1:41:13] pray together, shall we? Gracious
[1:41:15] Father, Lord, as we stand here today, we
[1:41:20] want to be your mouthpiece, Lord, where
[1:41:21] you can step in, Lord. You can you can
[1:41:24] live through us, Father. Lord, that our
[1:41:26] actions, our words, our mannerisms,
[1:41:28] Lord, how we speak to people,
[1:41:30] irrespective of if they're a believer or
[1:41:32] or or not, Father, Lord Jesus, Lord, how
[1:41:35] we speak to people would be you speaking
[1:41:37] to them. Father, it be like, as the
[1:41:38] Apostle Paul would say, it's no longer I
[1:41:40] that liveth, but Christ that liveth in
[1:41:42] me, Lord Jesus, the life I now live, I
[1:41:44] live by the faith of the Son of God.
[1:41:47] That's what we want to be, Lord. We want
[1:41:48] to be your mouthpiece. We don't want to
[1:41:50] be cold. We don't want to be
[1:41:51] indifferent, Lord. And we and we
[1:41:53] especially don't want to be lukewarm,
[1:41:55] Father. Lord, Lord, that we're just our
[1:41:57] own mouthpiece or we're the devil's
[1:41:58] mouthpiece or Father, we want to be on
[1:42:00] fire for you, dear God. You could take
[1:42:02] our vocal cords, take our lips, take our
[1:42:04] hearts, Lord Jesus, and speak to this
[1:42:07] dying world, Father. Speak to the Lord,
[1:42:09] we see what's happened in the Vatican.
[1:42:11] We can see this world of, Father,
[1:42:13] falling apart. We can see America is
[1:42:15] indeed up to its eyeballs and beyond as
[1:42:17] the prophet said it would go bust. Lord,
[1:42:19] we see all these things going on, dear
[1:42:21] God, but Father, may we not be caught up
[1:42:24] in those things necessarily, but may we
[1:42:26] be caught up in your word. Lord, may we
[1:42:28] have a love for the truth, dear God. May
[1:42:30] we have such a zeal and a thankfulness,
[1:42:32] Lord, such a joy to serve you, Lord.
[1:42:35] Irrespective of what's going on in life,
[1:42:37] Lord, the troubles, whatever it may be,
[1:42:39] Lord, we live in a complex time, but
[1:42:41] Father, may we just love you. May we
[1:42:43] just be on fire for you, dear God. May
[1:42:44] we be burning hot, Lord, that you can
[1:42:46] speak through us, Lord. So may you
[1:42:48] cleanse our hearts, Lord Jesus. Cleanse
[1:42:49] our minds, cleanse our spirits, Lord.
[1:42:52] Father, refill us with your Holy Ghost,
[1:42:54] Lord. Those who haven't given their
[1:42:55] lives to you, Lord, in this audience,
[1:42:56] Lord. I pray they would, Father. Lord,
[1:42:58] it's not you holding them back from
[1:43:00] repenting, giving their lives, being
[1:43:01] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:43:02] know it's not you holding them back.
[1:43:04] It's the enemy holding them back. So may
[1:43:06] they may the enemy give way now in the
[1:43:07] name of Jesus Christ. And Father, may we
[1:43:09] all come to our position in you, dear
[1:43:11] God, on fire for you, Lord. Come live
[1:43:13] through our lives, Lord. We want to
[1:43:15] rededicate our lives into your hands for
[1:43:17] your glory, Lord. And Father, if we got
[1:43:19] lukewarm, forgive us, Lord. We don't
[1:43:21] want to be like that, Lord. We want to
[1:43:22] be on fire for you, Lord. Loving you in
[1:43:25] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:43:27] Amen.

[1:59:34] They're new every morning, Lord. They're

[1:59:51] never gets weak, Lord. It's just always
[1:59:52] powerful. It's always refreshing. It's
[1:59:54] always full of love and full of grace,
[1:59:56] Lord. Full of longsuffering, full of
[1:59:58] tenderness, full of goodness, Lord. Full
[2:00:00] of hope, full of joy. There's just so
[2:00:02] many good things you, Lord. So, I just
[2:00:04] pray that your the rivers of living
[2:00:05] water would continue to pour out upon
[2:00:07] each life here, Lord. that we'd be a
[2:00:09] would all be living springs, Lord, and
[2:00:11] just have the life of God bubbling up
[2:00:14] from us, Lord. That nothing that we our
[2:00:16] lives wouldn't become stale and
[2:00:17] stagnant, Lord, but it would be vibrant
[2:00:18] and fresh and new every morning, Lord.
[2:00:20] And just, Lord, it would be as though we
[2:00:22] just meet you for the first time each
[2:00:23] and every day, Lord Jesus. So, we just
[2:00:25] want to commit each one here to your
[2:00:27] hands. We thank you so much for your
[2:00:28] grace. We thank you so much for your
[2:00:29] goodness and for speaking with us this
[2:00:31] morning, Lord. We just pray in Jesus
[2:00:33] wonderful name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise
[2:00:35] the Lord. God bless you all this
