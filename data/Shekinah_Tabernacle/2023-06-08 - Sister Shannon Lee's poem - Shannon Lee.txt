TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if I ever seen a sorrowful sight in all my 20 years of battle and fights is a complainer so simple no plainer a complainer but did you know I bet you didn't because it may not show a complainer is not a complainer without a one-eyed six-leg Wally Winder that's right what a terrible sight what a frightful fright a complainer is just a person a people a peep walking life's journey prepared or asleep and then boom something happens something out of the ordinary something goes wrong and the first thing you know here comes the Wally wonder which is six legs long its legs wave about with fear dismay and doubt its tentacles try to attack with sections of a pending doom and it attacks oh my only oh no let me see if I can get this nice the Wally Winder has suctioned the eye see see all is falling all is failing surely this is your doom this is your fate how could God let you get to this state Oh Me Oh My the second thing you know the Wally World winter has suctioned the brain oh the humiliation oh the shame you didn't want this why is this happening who's the culprit who's to blame Oh Me Oh My oh my third thing you know the Wally has suctioned the arms you're too weak too weary to warn don't raise your hands just be downcast beaten forlorn Oh Me Oh My Oh no now the feet I turn the page sorry the wallywag winter has wrapped the feet to stop the person in their tracks rendering them immovable unfruitful it attacks from moving forward pressing on the Wally Winder has nearly one then then oh no oh me oh my oh no the mouth the wallywag winter goes for the tongue to make confession to make profession of what they believe of what they'll receive all or what they'll be come but wait don't give up it's not too late this is not your doom this is not your fate don't be crowned a complainer a mega moaner a wally-wall winter just believe all things are possible all things work together for the good that love the Lord we are more than conquerors what can separate us fight him by Praise bite him by testimony smack him by song Whack Him by dance kick him by Joy sorry sicken by faith good job babes you did it ends up in the air you won [Applause] now now you can speak now you can move now you can think now you can see now you've got your Victory and if the one-eyed six-legged Wally Winder comes crawling creeping sneaking back when another one of life's trials changes rearranges comes you comes to you along the way don't give him don't give him the time of day just lift up your arms and say I believe God what come what may I believe God in Me For Me All Around Me [Applause]
