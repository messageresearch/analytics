[2:17] Lord bless the reading of your word you
[2:19] may have your seats this morning I want
[2:20] to uh I I pray this all works together
[2:24] but I want to talk about having the joy
[2:25] of the Lord you know we we live in such
[2:29] a a
[2:30] uh uncertain time there's troubles on
[2:32] every hand there's a time of trouble
[2:34] that there's never been upon the Earth
[2:35] as is now but even in this time of
[2:37] trouble you know the bride of Christ can
[2:39] rest amen because our lord Jesus has
[2:41] everything under control and you know to
[2:44] the believer it is the most joyful time
[2:47] of all ages because we're going to be
[2:49] we're going to walk with God and we are
[2:50] and we shall be not cuz the Lord's going
[2:52] to take us so to me that should give us
[2:54] such a joy such a peace such a
[2:56] thankfulness in our hearts because he's
[2:58] going to take us home Hallelujah you
[3:00] know we know every every Prophet down
[3:02] Through the Ages Every believer if they
[3:04] could trade their place for your place
[3:05] they would trade it in a heartbeat
[3:08] Hallelujah but you know the Lord
[3:09] ordained that we would live at this time
[3:12] H he you know he knew the conditions
[3:13] that we would be living in he knew the
[3:15] trouble we'd be facing he knew you know
[3:17] how how our society would be everything
[3:20] would be but yet in that even in this
[3:22] great darkness that we live in there is
[3:23] joy unspeakable full of Glory you know
[3:26] the Apostle Paul would would would say
[3:28] here in Romans 14:17 just to take this
[3:32] for the kingdom of God is Not meat and
[3:33] drink but righteousness and peace and
[3:36] joy in the Holy Ghost so this is the
[3:38] kingdom of God it's not meat and drink
[3:40] and you know those things but it's
[3:42] righteousness peace and joy in the Holy
[3:45] Ghost so now if if if if you have the
[3:48] Holy Ghost you have you you have the
[3:50] access to all joy you have the access to
[3:52] all peace you know I I'm so thankful we
[3:55] do not serve a limited God a God that
[3:57] has borders a God that has Ed is a God
[4:00] that you know you can come to the extent
[4:01] of him but he is Unlimited in his Joy
[4:05] he's Unlimited in his peace and his love
[4:07] and his favor and his power to heal the
[4:09] power to save the power to redeem he is
[4:11] an unlimited God and if he's unlimited
[4:14] he's Unlimited in power he's Unlimited
[4:16] in knowledge he's Unlimited in all
[4:18] things amen so we cannot limit Our God
[4:21] hallelujah so you know this I'm just so
[4:23] thankful we serve a God that's not an
[4:25] Angry God brother Braham said he used to
[4:27] think the father was mad at him but the
[4:29] but the son loves them but he found out
[4:30] that Jesus Christ was the heart of God
[4:32] they weren't two different gods you know
[4:34] and he realized that the Lord loved him
[4:35] with all of his heart Hallelujah so you
[4:38] know and and and when we come to that
[4:39] spot that God is not angry at us you
[4:41] know some people would be scared like
[4:43] David would say the Lord's at my right
[4:45] hand that I shall not be moved some
[4:46] people be scared Oh you mean God's right
[4:48] there all the time now he's going to
[4:49] tell me of no no God's there to preserve
[4:51] you he's there to keep you he's there to
[4:53] guide you I mean the very God that
[4:55] created you that you would worship him
[4:56] as present with you always that's a
[4:58] wonderful thing that gives me joy amen
[5:02] hallelujah now David yeah I just took a
[5:06] couple of scriptures here out of First
[5:07] Chronicles this this is the this is
[5:10] where David is is uh sitting in motion
[5:13] to bring the ark into Jerusalem so so
[5:16] the word is now in a transition it's
[5:17] been with the Philistines and been in
[5:19] the house of Odom Edom and you know it's
[5:21] but but now it's coming into Jerusalem
[5:23] where it will rest eventually in the
[5:25] temple so now the word is transitioning
[5:27] from one place to another but notice now
[5:30] the theme of of of David here sure this
[5:33] is a serious time but this is a
[5:35] tremendous time to the believer because
[5:37] their God member of the Ark the presence
[5:39] of God was above between the cheram
[5:41] above the mercy seat and they believed
[5:43] and knew that God would speak to them
[5:45] from that place so so now the word is
[5:47] going to come into the city where the
[5:48] people are and David's now going to
[5:51] instruct the people this is how I want
[5:52] you to be worshiping when the word's in
[5:55] transition now when I speak about the
[5:56] word being in transition I'm talking
[5:58] about the word is about to go from this
[6:00] world into the Millennium now we know we
[6:02] are the word made flesh right if the
[6:04] Holy Ghost is in you you are the word
[6:06] made flesh the word is no longer above
[6:09] no longer in a Mercy Seat but it's now
[6:11] in a mercy seat in the in in flesh right
[6:14] so that same God is now in you amen we
[6:16] don't you know we don't just this
[6:18] Christianity we have it's not something
[6:21] that's just Theory it's living it's a
[6:23] living God it's a living word right we
[6:26] written Epistles read and know of all
[6:27] men so it's not something we just learn
[6:29] and we're and we're separated from you
[6:31] know you know to walk with God is not
[6:33] something just in here but it's in here
[6:35] it's got to be a heartfelt religion it's
[6:37] got to be reality in the heart and when
[6:39] it becomes a reality in the heart that's
[6:41] when God lives in the heart amen so so
[6:44] now when I talk about the word
[6:46] transitioning because I'm talking about
[6:47] the bride is going to leave there's
[6:49] going to be a millennium the seven
[6:50] Church ages is coming to an end right so
[6:53] there transition season we are now
[6:54] living in a transition season where the
[6:57] Gentiles going to be taken in a Rapture
[6:59] and this same gospel the same Mercy the
[7:01] same Jesus Christ we know is going to go
[7:03] to the Jews am mean so we're living in a
[7:05] transition season the blindness of the
[7:06] Gentiles is coming on and the Jewish
[7:08] eyes are coming open just as when the
[7:10] gospel came in the eyes of the Jews were
[7:12] being blinded that the Gentile eyes were
[7:14] coming open right so now this is how
[7:16] David wants to Institute the worship
[7:18] when the word is
[7:20] transitioning and David spake to the
[7:22] chief of the Levites to appoint their
[7:25] Brethren to the singers with instruments
[7:27] of music posteries and Harps and symbols
[7:30] sounding by lifting up their voice with
[7:33] joy so he's saying this is how I want
[7:35] you to worship as the word is moving
[7:37] Hallelujah so it's not with a somberness
[7:39] it's not a funeral March it's not
[7:40] feeling sorry for ourselves or
[7:42] criticizing all the nations around us no
[7:44] it's with joy this is how I want you to
[7:46] be as the ark is moving to its final
[7:48] destination there it's going to be with
[7:50] joy Hallelujah there's going to be a
[7:51] rejoicing wouldn't you be happy if the
[7:53] king is coming into your city amen you
[7:56] wouldn't put out you wouldn't be putting
[7:57] out black flags and putting flags at
[7:59] half mast and somber You' be rejoicing
[8:01] here's the one we love here's the one we
[8:03] worship here's the one we adore amen
[8:05] it's going to be with joy Lord amen and
[8:08] so David and the Elders of Israel and
[8:10] the captains over thousands went to
[8:11] bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the
[8:14] Lord out of the house of OB Edom with
[8:16] joy Hallelujah it was a joyous occasion
[8:20] Hallelujah that's why David danced there
[8:21] was an atmosphere but he was instituting
[8:23] this the ministry is saying this is how
[8:25] the people should be when the AR comes
[8:28] into the city
[8:30] amen Glory
[8:32] Hallelujah now Nehemiah would so so Joy
[8:37] I you know I believe we're living in a
[8:39] season of Joy this is the marriage of
[8:41] the Lamb this is a season where a
[8:43] Heavenly bridegroom is being united with
[8:45] an Earthly bride this is a time of joy
[8:47] you know I've never ever been to a
[8:48] wedding that's a sad
[8:50] wedding I've never seen the you know the
[8:52] bride be sad the bridegroom be sad the
[8:54] best men be sad the minister be sad the
[8:57] Bridesmaids be sad the flower girl sad
[8:59] I've never seen that I've only seen Joy
[9:02] Hallelujah you because there's a uniting
[9:04] coming along you know where where where
[9:06] there's been a longing maybe for a long
[9:08] season or a short season where your your
[9:10] bride and a bridegroom will be United
[9:12] and their identity's going to be changed
[9:13] and you know there's been a longing
[9:15] Hallelujah and now now The Season's here
[9:17] hallelujah it's no longer now the
[9:19] invitations have gone out now now the
[9:21] ceremon is taking place Hallelujah and
[9:23] something that was dreamed about talked
[9:25] about longed for is now a reality
[9:27] Hallelujah so I've never seen a wedding
[9:28] that is SA
[9:30] I've only seen a happy wedding you know
[9:32] and and and to me you know to me that
[9:34] Joy shouldn't fade after the wedding it
[9:37] should get greater because now you're
[9:38] entering into a different kind of walk
[9:40] Hallelujah a different kind of
[9:41] relationship and you know that Joy
[9:43] should just get bigger sir as I said God
[9:45] is unlimited so so the joy the believer
[9:48] can experience is unlimited the peace
[9:50] because he said I'll give you peace that
[9:52] passes understanding so the peace that
[9:54] God gives is greater than the limited
[9:56] peace a man can give or a woman can give
[9:58] it goes beyond amen Hallelujah so same
[10:01] thing with joy you say well you're just
[10:02] trying to get us to be happy well I
[10:04] think we should be happy I believe this
[10:06] message came to you and it's pardoning
[10:08] Grace Hallelujah when that cloud
[10:10] appeared that you know the Supreme judge
[10:11] would you know you know appeared in the
[10:13] heaven some people think well that's
[10:14] just judgment coming to the Earth it is
[10:16] but it also judges you righteous am mean
[10:19] just like Jesus there there's that woman
[10:20] caught in adultery and the scribes and
[10:22] Pharisees tried to get him who was the
[10:24] lawgiver to to condemn her but she he
[10:28] actually judged her without
[10:30] sin
[10:32] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[10:34] we're in John 8 isn't that right so now
[10:36] when the Lord appeared there amen he's
[10:38] just yeah sure judgment was coming to
[10:40] the world but he was actually judging no
[10:41] the bride is without sin amen the blood
[10:43] that I shed on Calvary is enough for her
[10:46] how it's been attributed to her
[10:47] Hallelujah so you know I think this is a
[10:51] joyous time I'm without spot or
[10:54] wrinkle is that because you said no
[10:56] because he said UND depending upon what
[10:58] he said what he's declared to me I say
[11:00] Amen H just like Mary said Let It Be
[11:03] unto me according to Thy word that's
[11:05] that's just what she said or was she
[11:06] didn't understand how it happened but
[11:08] Gabriel said this is how it's going to
[11:09] happen where she said well let it be
[11:10] unto me according to your word and I
[11:12] think we should look into the scripture
[11:13] and whatever God says about us we say
[11:15] Let It Be unto me according to Thy word
[11:17] so if I've been Sanctified by the by the
[11:19] blood of the Lamb Let It Be unto me
[11:20] according to Thy word if I'm accepted in
[11:22] the Beloved Let It Be unto me according
[11:24] to Thy word hallelujah if I righteous as
[11:26] God is righteous Let It Be unto me
[11:27] according to Thy Word Hallelujah
[11:29] shouldn't it be that way if God said I
[11:31] was a certain way let it be unto me
[11:33] according to Thy word hallelujah it's
[11:35] like you always think of Christine's dad
[11:38] you know brother Albert's testimony
[11:39] where he was he was um becoming a
[11:42] Believer and you know he went to a
[11:44] meeting and you know you know the Bible
[11:46] says that we are Saints we are
[11:48] Sanctified and then he spoke to the
[11:50] preacher afterwards and and the preacher
[11:52] said well have you ever thanked him for
[11:53] it have you actually thanked him because
[11:56] in his present condition he didn't feel
[11:57] that way brother Albert but then but
[11:59] then and the preacher said have you ever
[12:00] thanked him that he Sanctified you and
[12:02] they prayed and he thanked him and then
[12:03] when he was driving home the spirit of
[12:05] God Came Upon him in the car brother
[12:06] Albert and he had to stop and he was
[12:07] rejoicing outside because he realized he
[12:09] was a saint amen and that's how we
[12:12] should be you know have you ever thanked
[12:13] him you say well I'm not I'm not what I
[12:15] think I should be in God but have you
[12:17] ever thanked him that you are that
[12:19] actually right because whoever is called
[12:21] he's Justified whoever is called he has
[12:23] already glorified so have you already
[12:25] have you actually ever thanked him that
[12:27] you're glorified or you thanked him that
[12:29] he called and you're
[12:30] Justified Hallelujah because that's how
[12:32] we should approach God because in God's
[12:35] mind it's a done deal it's a finished
[12:36] work Paul says that the works were
[12:38] finished before the foundation of the
[12:40] world so so in God's mind we're there
[12:43] hallelujah we're in white robes we're
[12:45] around the throne the devil's just not
[12:46] even ashes no more Hallelujah and
[12:48] Eternity is rolling on because he's an
[12:50] eternal being he's already seen the End
[12:52] Amen we read last night there in
[12:54] Revelations 21 and God says it's done
[12:57] hallelujah I like that when God just is
[12:59] it's done it's done amen so so if that's
[13:02] how God sees things I should you know we
[13:04] should say
[13:05] amen
[13:07] hallelujah to me that takes out all the
[13:09] battles because the devil tries to keep
[13:10] you trapped in time in your current
[13:12] state but really you should look your
[13:14] current state really should be the word
[13:16] we need to testify about ourselves about
[13:18] what the word says about us am mean so
[13:20] if the word says I'm an overcomer I'm an
[13:21] overcomer if the word says I'm the bride
[13:23] of Christ join ear with Christ amen
[13:26] hallelujah if the if the word says I can
[13:28] do all things through Christ Jesus was
[13:29] strengthens me amen if the word says I
[13:32] have joy peace love longsuffering Faith
[13:35] all the fruits of the spirit amen
[13:36] granted the statue of the perfect man
[13:38] amen shouldn't we talk about ourselves
[13:41] that way because we are his workmanship
[13:43] Hallelujah and you know if the master
[13:45] builder has come and said I'm going to
[13:46] build a church I'm going to make it
[13:48] without spot or wrinkle washed in the
[13:50] blood of the Lamb made in my image amen
[13:53] amen hallelujah glory to God I think
[13:56] that should give us joy if the word says
[13:59] the devil's been exposed in this hour
[14:02] amen hallelujah
[14:06] hallelujah amen now
[14:09] Nehemiah let's not go there we go here
[14:12] now the word is yo y nehemiah's day here
[14:15] so so they uh they've just opened the
[14:18] book to the people they've read the law
[14:20] and things and and and of course the
[14:22] people are crying and they're upset cuz
[14:24] they realize they haven't been keeping
[14:25] the word but then
[14:27] Nehemiah says Nehemiah which is the um t
[14:32] t which is the governor and Ezra the
[14:35] priest The Scribe and the Levites that
[14:37] taught the people said unto all the
[14:38] people this day is Holy unto the Lord
[14:40] your God moreour not nor weep for all
[14:43] the people WEP when they heard the words
[14:44] of the law then he said unto them go you
[14:47] way eat fat and drink the sweet and send
[14:49] portion unto them of whom um is nothing
[14:53] I mean for for whom nothing is prepared
[14:55] for this day is Holy unto the Lord Our
[14:57] God neither be ye sorry for the joy of
[15:01] the Lord is your strength now this word
[15:03] strength here means a fortified place it
[15:07] means a defense it means a fortress it's
[15:09] a strength you know it's a stronghold so
[15:12] notice he did not say um put up walls
[15:16] against other people for that's your
[15:17] strength right or protect yourselves or
[15:19] just be distant from people and you know
[15:21] emotionally detached and he didn't say
[15:23] that's your strength he did not say
[15:26] criticism of of other people is your
[15:28] strength am mean he did not say you know
[15:30] to to to think you're better than others
[15:32] is your strength remember because a
[15:34] place of Defense now he see the joy of
[15:36] the Lord is your strength amen so now
[15:38] there's a there's actually in the joy of
[15:40] the Lord there is a
[15:42] defense Hallelujah there's a defense
[15:45] against bitterness there's a defense
[15:47] against a critical spirit I mean there's
[15:49] a defense against reasoning I mean
[15:51] there's a defense against anything
[15:52] contrary to the word of God there's a
[15:54] defense in the joy of the Lord amen so
[15:57] he said the joy of the Lord is your
[15:58] strength so therefore if that was under
[16:00] the blood of bulls and goats how much
[16:02] more under the blood of Jesus Christ
[16:04] Hallelujah listen we can go rejoicing
[16:07] all the way into
[16:08] heaven we can do it Hallelujah now I
[16:12] just want to show you many people or
[16:14] maybe just in my little brain I used to
[16:17] think in the Old Testament that if the
[16:18] people just went through the motions of
[16:20] keeping the word it was
[16:22] enough and we we should obey the word of
[16:25] God so I'm not saying this in a loose
[16:27] way haard whatever but it was was more
[16:29] than just going through the motions now
[16:31] when when when Moses was was giving his
[16:34] last address to Israel in Deuteronomy he
[16:36] would go into Deuteronomy what we call
[16:39] 28 and and he would speak of all the
[16:40] blessings and the cursings and
[16:42] everything and now this is not the whole
[16:44] list but you can read the whole chapter
[16:45] but he says here he says the stranger
[16:47] that is within thee so this he he's
[16:50] saying this is what's going to happen to
[16:51] you basically the stranger that is
[16:54] within thee shall uh get up above thee
[16:57] very high and thou shalt come down very
[16:59] low and he shall lend to thee and thou
[17:03] shalt not lend to him he shall be the
[17:05] head and thou shall be the tail moreover
[17:07] all these curses shall come upon thee
[17:10] and thou and shall pursue thee and
[17:12] overtake thee till thou be destroyed
[17:14] because thou hearken us not to the voice
[17:16] of the Lord thy God to keep his
[17:18] Commandments and his statutes which he
[17:20] commanded thee and they shall be unto
[17:23] thee for a sign and for a wonder and
[17:25] upon uh and upon thy seed forever now
[17:28] notice the reason for this because thou
[17:31] servest not the Lord thy God with
[17:33] joyfulness and with gladness of heart
[17:35] for the abundance of all things so so
[17:38] Moses is saying the reason that all
[17:40] these curses which as I said you read
[17:42] the whole chapter there's all these
[17:43] curses these things will come will come
[17:45] upon future Generations is because they
[17:48] came to a place where they didn't serve
[17:50] the Lord with joyfulness and with
[17:52] gladness of heart so that so it wasn't
[17:54] just going through emotion but obviously
[17:56] there came a time where they they were
[17:58] Serv the Lord with joyfulness and
[18:00] gladness of heart imagine that the
[18:02] Lord's just came in just drove all the
[18:03] inhabitants of the land out you're in
[18:04] your Promised Land you've received what
[18:06] Moses said you would receive am mean you
[18:09] could say when you now in your Promised
[18:10] Land you say this day the scriptures
[18:12] fulfilled am mean now you're in the
[18:14] promised land so so that generation
[18:15] would have served him with joyfulness
[18:17] because they saw the hand of the Lord
[18:19] deliver them and bring them into their
[18:21] into their inheritance but there would
[18:22] have come a time where a cycle came in
[18:25] where it wasn't joyfulness anymore and
[18:27] gladness of heart but it be but it just
[18:29] was reduced to going through the motions
[18:32] and then once that leaves once once
[18:34] there is once joy and gladness of heart
[18:37] leaves the people and they just go
[18:38] through the motions where then that
[18:40] cycle will continue down till they start
[18:42] to look at other things and then they
[18:44] started to serve other gods and look for
[18:46] other they tried to find satisfaction in
[18:48] something else and not obeying the word
[18:50] of God with
[18:52] joyfulness so we should always serve the
[18:54] Lord with joyfulness you just think of
[18:57] that for the abundance of all things has
[18:59] there ever been a generation upon the
[19:01] Earth that has the abundance of all
[19:03] things now I'm not talking about natural
[19:05] things I'm not talking about fancy cars
[19:08] big houses travel whatever whatever I'm
[19:10] not talking about those things I'm
[19:11] talking about spiritual abundance am me
[19:14] we're not just living off crumbs we're
[19:16] not living off just little half of
[19:18] scripture somewhere but the whole
[19:19] Council of God has come open to us I
[19:22] mean where the book has come open to a
[19:23] people we have the abundance of all
[19:25] things you know I'm so thankful we're
[19:27] not living in a day where we can just
[19:29] reach a certain level and that's as high
[19:30] as we can live well what do you mean by
[19:32] that well Luther preached that just
[19:34] shall live by faith and that was an
[19:35] incredible work of God in his day but
[19:38] that's as high as he could go he
[19:39] couldn't be Sanctified you know he was
[19:42] you know you he used to drink smoke a
[19:43] pipe hate the Jews all different kinds
[19:45] of things but you know that's as high as
[19:47] they could live in that day and and and
[19:49] and people got to that height and that
[19:51] was it and then Wiley came along with
[19:53] the second work of Grace there was other
[19:55] reformers before that we know things
[19:56] were being unfolded but he was a
[19:57] messenger for us age and you know so
[19:59] they were justified by faith but then
[20:01] they Sanctified but it was actually a
[20:03] human uh it was a method of
[20:05] sanctification that's why they're called
[20:06] Methodist they had a method of living a
[20:08] holy life but we know now we don't have
[20:10] a method of living a holy life but the
[20:12] Holy Ghost in us sanctifies us out
[20:15] Hallelujah so it's not us trying to
[20:16] reform ourselves and live a holy life he
[20:19] comes and changes our appetite as I said
[20:22] when I was young I couldn't stand
[20:23] broccoli cuz there was nothing in me
[20:24] that wanted the broccoli but there came
[20:26] a time in life where broccoli wasn't so
[20:28] bad my appetite changed amen hallelujah
[20:31] and I remember many things and I see it
[20:33] repeating down in my own girls where
[20:35] where I was young and I'd look at
[20:36] something I never had it before but I
[20:38] said I don't like it and I knew I never
[20:40] had it before I knew I never but no I
[20:43] don't like it and we see a cycle
[20:45] continue but you know but but but when
[20:48] my but when my appetite my attitude
[20:50] changed my my my taste changed then I
[20:53] liked it Hallelujah
[21:02] amen so so aren't you glad because the
[21:04] Lord changes your appetite you know cuz
[21:07] this this Christian walk is not a
[21:09] suppression of of of worldly lusts this
[21:12] is not a suppression of trying to keep
[21:14] yourself from what the devil has for you
[21:16] and thinks you this is not suppressing
[21:18] nothing this is not living as a as an
[21:20] inter cled nun away from the world no
[21:23] but God changes the heart of when you
[21:25] really give your heart to God and give
[21:27] those things to God God put them in the
[21:29] right place Hallelujah and then you can
[21:31] walk through this world and there's
[21:32] nothing in you that wants it used to be
[21:34] a time where I love this world but then
[21:36] God changed my heart now I don't want to
[21:37] eat it no more
[21:40] Hallelujah and it doesn't matter how how
[21:42] how polished it gets I just don't want
[21:44] it just like when I was young you could
[21:46] put that broccoli in a lot of different
[21:48] ways but I didn't want the
[21:50] broccoli so we should serve we have the
[21:52] abundance of all things Hallelujah then
[21:55] the Pentecostals came along with the
[21:56] restoration of the gifts they believed
[21:57] in justif ation sanctification then God
[22:00] poured out his Spirit then the gifts
[22:01] were restored that's as high as they
[22:02] could live but now the full counsel of
[22:04] God is open in this day where we can
[22:06] grow to the stature of the fullness of
[22:08] Christ amen hallelujah so everything
[22:10] Christ is we can become by his grace
[22:13] amen where when he looks down and sees
[22:15] us he sees himself amen replicated in a
[22:18] people
[22:20] hallelujah amen so we have an abundance
[22:23] of all things I mean to know that our
[22:26] sins aren't just covered I mean to know
[22:29] that God actually forgets our sin he
[22:32] doesn't attribute those he doesn't
[22:34] attribute those things to us anymore he
[22:36] doesn't hold our past against us he
[22:38] doesn't keep it hanging over us you know
[22:40] to know that we are actually in a
[22:42] Rapture cycle Hallelujah that's an
[22:44] abundance of all things am me to know
[22:46] that the mighty Angel has descended the
[22:48] anointing that we feel Among Us not just
[22:50] in these four walls but even when you by
[22:52] yourself that anointing comes down that
[22:54] is Christ coming to you Hallelujah I
[22:56] mean when his word comes open where it's
[22:57] no longer history is no longer stories
[22:59] it's a reality from Genesis to
[23:01] Revelation Amen to me that's why the
[23:03] message is so great it opens the
[23:05] scripture and makes it a living book
[23:07] amen and you can be you can be reading
[23:10] portions of it where brother Bram never
[23:11] touches on it but it becomes alive to
[23:13] you why because the author of the book
[23:15] comes to you and makes it live amen yeah
[23:18] so I'm so thankful that we don't throw
[23:20] away the Old Testament but there is
[23:21] truth in it amen hallelujah and and in
[23:24] the gospels is even richer than ever
[23:26] before amen why we have the abundance of
[23:29] all
[23:29] things Hallelujah that's why we should
[23:32] serve the Lord with joyfulness amen it's
[23:35] such a joy to come to church it's such a
[23:37] joy to pray it's such a joy to read the
[23:39] Bible such a joy to hear the message
[23:41] such a joy to sing songs to the Lord
[23:43] such a joy to you know live for him and
[23:46] walk with
[23:47] himall amen hey how can we not be glad
[23:50] now remember you may be going through
[23:52] the biggest trial of your life but that
[23:54] doesn't take away your salvation but the
[23:56] devil tries to get us to look at circum
[23:58] ances but the Lord wants us to look at
[24:01] his word and what we are in him right if
[24:03] we focus on our trouble then then that
[24:05] will what we will we will become that
[24:07] trouble amen but if we focus on his
[24:10] promises to us all's going to be fine
[24:13] amen cuz remember our identity is not in
[24:15] this
[24:16] time right remember when when when
[24:19] eternity is rolled on time is no more we
[24:22] will not be defined by this year
[24:27] 2021 amen it'll pass our identity is in
[24:30] our Lord Jesus Christ amen so if our
[24:33] identity is in him then then that's who
[24:35] that's the one we should focus on in
[24:37] love now I love this um I get the our
[24:40] daily strength devotionals and then they
[24:42] you know put this up yesterday I really
[24:44] loved it something happened to me a few
[24:46] weeks ago and I'm determined by the help
[24:48] of God never to be negative on anything
[24:50] anymore to blast my heart out and remind
[24:53] me or no matter what it costs you be
[24:56] sincere and down to the bottom of it
[24:57] that's the truth and men just educate
[24:59] themselves so they educate themselves
[25:01] away from one another they get complexes
[25:04] you don't get no complex by the blood of
[25:06] Jesus Christ you get love hallelujah
[25:10] amen that's where see you get love not a
[25:12] complex that I'm a little bigger than
[25:14] somebody else a little better than
[25:15] somebody else and know a little more
[25:17] than somebody else you just get your
[25:19] arms around everybody it's a basis of
[25:21] Love through the blood the blood
[25:23] cleanses amen so goes to show that real
[25:26] Christianity doesn't give a complex
[25:28] blood you you know the Lord can't give a
[25:30] complex the blood can't give a complex
[25:32] it produces
[25:33] love Hallelujah I like that real good
[25:37] Hallelujah but now we know that we live
[25:39] in an age where because iniquity shall
[25:41] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[25:44] but God has built the believer in such a
[25:46] way that we come to a place where
[25:48] atmosphere and situation does not
[25:50] change who we are now I'm going to jump
[25:53] to this for some reason I put this in
[25:55] but I'm sure it'll make sense if we go
[25:57] to
[26:00] everyone who reads fast don't
[26:04] read now this is the Niagra Falls oh
[26:07] wait let's read the scripture first and
[26:09] the last day that great day of the feast
[26:10] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[26:12] thirst let him come unto me and drink he
[26:14] that believeth on me as the scripture
[26:15] hath said out of his belly shall flow
[26:17] rivers of Living Water but this he spake
[26:20] of the spirit um uh which they that
[26:23] believe on him should receive for the
[26:24] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[26:26] that Jesus was not yet glorify so he's
[26:29] saying this is how the spirit's going to
[26:30] be it's going to be a gusher it's going
[26:32] to be rivers of Living Water not just a
[26:34] trickle not just an argument there going
[26:36] to be a Life coming forth Hallelujah now
[26:39] who's been to the Niagara Falls here
[26:41] it's a big place apparently and so so
[26:44] this is like to me this is rivers of
[26:46] Living Water we know it's a connection
[26:48] between two lakes and things but you
[26:49] know to me this is rivers of Living
[26:51] Water and no doubt the sound of the
[26:53] falls is very loud hallelujah it's not a
[26:56] trickle it's not opening a tap there's
[26:58] there's a lot of I don't know what ton
[26:59] of water moves per whatever but there's
[27:01] a lot of water and and to me this is
[27:03] like the believer Hallelujah like the
[27:06] rock that Moses smoted in the wilderness
[27:08] a lot of water came out of it it wasn't
[27:10] just a trickle member he had to water
[27:12] all those animals 2 million people
[27:14] there's a lot of people and and they
[27:15] were thirsty so they weren't just
[27:17] waiting no we'll wait for our time no no
[27:18] had to be a big gusher of water come out
[27:20] of that rock and now that Rock's a new
[27:22] cuz that rock is Christ Hallelujah so
[27:24] now there's a lot of water coming down
[27:26] there but the thing is what happens now
[27:28] the atmosphere gets a bit cold
[27:31] yes it freezes this is Niagara Falls and
[27:35] and I think that these pictures are
[27:37] looking at this part of the Fall so this
[27:40] is n so this was in
[27:42] 1936 but it has happened before so this
[27:45] is when the atmosphere gets
[27:47] cold it's not full of life it's not full
[27:51] of love it's not a good atmosphere
[27:53] that's wholesome to being a Believer it
[27:56] gets cold
[27:58] and we know when when when when the cold
[28:00] comes hibernation comes things Retreat
[28:03] you know like leaves I mean trees they
[28:05] lose their leaves and so on those that
[28:07] do because the life goes into the roots
[28:09] to protect it so these people so so
[28:11] these are people and normally so they're
[28:15] walking around
[28:16] here when the water's flowing you don't
[28:19] want to be walking there you can't walk
[28:21] there it's impossible but then when the
[28:23] atmosphere gets a bit cold you and then
[28:26] look there's people on the top of it you
[28:27] up there there if they were there when
[28:29] it's running they would you know people
[28:30] have jumped off this in barrels and died
[28:32] and done stuff and you know so this can
[28:34] be like a Believer the water freezes
[28:37] it's still water you following me see
[28:40] this is why I say we shouldn't live
[28:41] according to our environment they should
[28:44] be something that is pulsating out
[28:46] hallelujah amen so so that's what
[28:48] happens is is the condition the
[28:50] atmosphere can get cold who's ever been
[28:52] in a cold
[28:53] condition but there is another spring
[28:57] you don't have to stay in the freezer
[28:58] you can walk out the sun's still good
[29:01] Hallelujah even after our one day of
[29:03] summer here in Wellington the sun is
[29:04] still good somewhere you know but then
[29:07] what happens is so so sometimes the
[29:09] conditions get cold enough where that
[29:12] River doesn't flow now it's our choice
[29:15] if it freezes or not amen and then
[29:18] sometimes because of man's uh what do
[29:21] you call
[29:22] meddling it can stop
[29:25] flowing now this is that same for
[29:28] it's not frozen it's not flowing well
[29:31] it's trickling a bit but it's not
[29:33] flowing anymore and the reason is
[29:36] because man had to build a dam up here
[29:38] to divert the water to do they did some
[29:40] maintenance or they did something but
[29:42] again it's man meddling that stops the
[29:45] water
[29:46] flowing now what is the purpose of the
[29:50] devil the devil doesn't want God to live
[29:51] in a people amen that is that is that is
[29:54] what he wants he wants us to become
[29:57] formal lukewarm and Powerless now I can
[30:01] you know you know I'm sure we can agree
[30:03] this waterfall is a powerless
[30:06] waterfall right it's not gushing it's
[30:08] not going to kill anyone it's not going
[30:10] to you know and maybe it's got a little
[30:12] bit of formality because it's still
[30:14] appears to be like a waterfall but it
[30:17] ain't that right and then also it can
[30:20] freeze over it still is a waterfall but
[30:22] it ain't that so that's what the devil
[30:24] wants us to be he wants us to become
[30:27] either a Frozen
[30:28] Christian suspended in
[30:31] animation don't get too happy don't
[30:33] shout don't testify don't Rejoice don't
[30:36] let it be like honey on your lips you
[30:38] know how good the word is and you I was
[30:40] thinking in the back office about that
[30:41] little baby beer that got into brother
[30:43] braham's bucket of Honey or molasses and
[30:45] got it all over him H that's how it
[30:47] should be we should reach our hand into
[30:48] the honey pot of the word and hey if it
[30:50] doesn't get in our mouth it goes all
[30:51] over us that's fine Hallelujah and then
[30:53] people who really see the Lord anoint
[30:55] someone they should say I want some of
[30:57] that too Hallelujah I want some of that
[30:59] amen and it just spreads everywhere yes
[31:01] sir glory to God hallelujah but the
[31:04] devil wants us to become like this but I
[31:06] say no God or has ordained we shall be
[31:09] like this Hallelujah why CU there's joy
[31:13] bubbling forth Peace Love Hallelujah joy
[31:16] and the Holy Ghost glory to God Amen
[31:23] Hallelujah now again don't read
[31:29] amen now as I said before there is a
[31:32] scripture that says because iniquity
[31:33] shall abound the love of many shall wax
[31:35] cold like because so so because of
[31:37] outside influences people's love W wax
[31:40] cold just like just like the Niagara
[31:42] Falls there was outside influences are
[31:43] either froze it or stopped it running am
[31:46] mean so so now we know that that spirit
[31:48] is in the world we know iniquity is
[31:50] abounding in this day but it's our
[31:52] response to that iniquity will depend if
[31:54] our love waxes cold or if it just gets
[31:56] greater yeah
[31:58] amen it is actually our choice because
[32:00] remember it should never be you know
[32:02] it's like Adam in the beginning he
[32:04] blamed Eve for the
[32:06] fall but it was his choice because he
[32:08] went with his eyes open to save his save
[32:10] his wife right he allowed it to come on
[32:13] because of love for his wife to try and
[32:15] redeem her but in his Fallen State he
[32:17] said it's her fault and and actually
[32:19] said God it's your fault cuz you gave me
[32:20] the
[32:21] woman even though before he even even
[32:24] before even Eve came out of Adam he was
[32:26] lonely and sad and God saw he was lonely
[32:28] and said it's not good that man dwelleth
[32:29] alone so God was just fulfilling the
[32:32] desire in his
[32:33] life right but then Adam when he got to
[32:36] his Fallen State he said God this is
[32:38] your fault we're in this condition and
[32:40] so man always blame something else for
[32:42] the present state they're in we should
[32:44] never be that way am mean we should be
[32:46] even in spite of the condition we should
[32:48] still be a believer we should still be a
[32:50] bubbling stream we still be your water
[32:53] should still be flowing from the rock
[32:54] hallelujah there still should be a joy a
[32:56] real reality of God God in our lives
[32:59] amen amen but so brother Braham says
[33:01] this in the church age book he says now
[33:02] do we have it then I
[33:04] want he says I know your love service
[33:07] and Faith now this is from the th tyon
[33:09] age faith and patience you'll note that
[33:11] their love is placed between works and
[33:13] service and that is the right place for
[33:15] it because without love our works is are
[33:18] are not accepted before God and neither
[33:20] is our service Paul speaking to the
[33:22] Corinthians here without love I am
[33:24] nothing and what's uh whatever I do is
[33:27] without profit unless it is done in love
[33:30] now you can see right here that these
[33:32] Believers weren't that nickan class that
[33:34] did works as mean of Salvation or to be
[33:37] admired by men they did their works out
[33:39] of out of the love of God that was shed
[33:42] abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost
[33:43] now there's a scripture Romans 5:5 that
[33:46] love in their hearts was God's love for
[33:48] his own Jesus Says by this all men know
[33:51] that ye are my disciples that you have
[33:53] love one for another the pagans who saw
[33:56] the lives of the early Christians said
[33:58] behold how they love one another so I
[34:00] say this the world should see something
[34:03] different he should not you know the
[34:05] world should not just see a group of
[34:06] religious people they should see a love
[34:09] between one another that is not in the
[34:11] world Amen because if we really have the
[34:14] love of God in our hearts amen we have a
[34:16] love the world knows nothing
[34:18] about amen amen behold how they love
[34:22] each other John said everyone that
[34:24] loveth is born of God Amen
[34:28] he says I want to give a warning right
[34:31] here it says concerning the last days
[34:33] that because of abounding iniquity the
[34:34] love of many will wax cold in the later
[34:36] scene or last age selflove and love for
[34:40] material things will take place of the
[34:42] true love of God now self love really
[34:45] boils down to what can I get for myself
[34:48] that is selflove but that's not a true
[34:50] love of God the true love of God goes
[34:52] out amen amen it's for someone else we
[34:56] need to guard against the power of sin
[34:58] in these last days so that many are
[35:00] getting so hard because they haven't
[35:02] realized the effect of this last day
[35:04] spirit so we can be a believer and
[35:06] become very hard and and and the reason
[35:09] that we become hard is because the
[35:10] effects of this last day Spirit that's
[35:12] in the world Amen we need to realize
[35:15] what's the water level going over my
[35:17] waterfall amen where's the you know
[35:20] where's the um you know is it going up
[35:22] or down or is it is it just constant
[35:24] gusher Hallelujah we need to guard I
[35:26] mean uh because I haven't realized the
[35:29] effect of this last day spirit it's time
[35:30] to draw nigh to God and let him fill our
[35:33] lives with his love or we will feel the
[35:35] coldness of the last day church and
[35:37] reject the truth of God which alone is
[35:39] able to help us in those dark and
[35:42] Dreadful years the True Vine held its
[35:44] love for God and the love for the
[35:46] Brethren God commanded them for it
[35:51] Hallelujah so we have a you know but I'm
[35:54] so thankful it doesn't matter how dark
[35:56] the world gets God is greater amen am
[35:58] mean whoever did physics or math is
[36:00] always the greater
[36:01] sign and and the one that's on the left
[36:04] side of the greater sign can never
[36:05] become greater than the greater one amen
[36:08] it's always greater than so so the power
[36:10] of the Holy Ghost of the believer is
[36:11] always greater than the world doesn't
[36:13] matter how much you stack on one side of
[36:15] the equation if the side of the equation
[36:18] that's on the good side of the greater
[36:20] than is greater than that that's always
[36:22] be less Hallelujah so it doesn't matter
[36:24] what the world Stacks up it can never be
[36:27] greater than the Holy Ghost and the
[36:28] believer the word made manifest in
[36:31] US
[36:33] amen
[36:35] now a lot of things give me joy in the
[36:38] word remember the joy joy in the Holy
[36:40] Ghost this is the kingdom of God and I
[36:42] saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the
[36:44] first heaven so this is what we read
[36:46] last night and the first Earth was
[36:47] passed away and there was no more sea
[36:49] and I John saw the holy city New
[36:51] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[36:53] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[36:55] her husband and I heard a great voice
[36:57] out of of Heaven saying behold the
[36:58] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[37:00] will dwell with them and they shall be
[37:02] his people and God himself shall be with
[37:04] them and be their God hallelujah amen
[37:07] that should give us joy and God shall
[37:10] wipe away all tears from their eyes and
[37:11] there shall be no more death neither
[37:13] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[37:15] any more pain for the former things are
[37:18] passed away and he sat upon the throne
[37:20] and said behold I make all things new
[37:22] and he said unto me write these words
[37:24] are faithful and true and he said unto
[37:26] me it is done I am Alpha and Omega and
[37:28] the the beginning and the end I will
[37:30] give unto him that is a thirst of the
[37:32] Fountain of the Water of Life freely he
[37:35] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[37:39] Hallelujah you know we're overcoming
[37:40] right now what's your current status
[37:43] Overcomer I haven't bowed to the world I
[37:45] haven't broken I you know Hallelujah I'm
[37:47] walking on with the lord well you say
[37:49] well I fallen on my face in the mud but
[37:51] if there's a desire in your heart to
[37:52] serve God I mean you'll get back up
[37:55] Hallelujah he that overcometh remember
[37:57] it's not him that wins the battle it's
[37:58] he that wins the war amen Hitler won a
[38:01] lot of battles but he lost the war and
[38:03] history he has gone down in history as a
[38:05] loser I mean just like the devil he may
[38:07] have won a lot of battles but he will
[38:09] lose the War I mean because our king of
[38:11] glory already defeated him the Lord
[38:13] Jesus Christ and he will go down in
[38:15] history as a loser as a defeated being
[38:18] as just a footnote in history as one who
[38:20] tried but he couldn't do it I mean cuz
[38:23] the devil don't have enough Hallelujah
[38:25] he is a defeated being he will and
[38:28] that's what history he will be
[38:29] remembered as a defeated being if he's
[38:31] ever remembered I don't care if he is or
[38:33] not Hallelujah but the believer will be
[38:36] remembered as the
[38:37] Overcomer Hallelujah we will be
[38:39] remembered as the Overcomer amen who
[38:41] overcame Satan and all of his Works am
[38:44] mean that should give us joy I mean
[38:45] we're going to win hallelujah we're
[38:47] really going to win
[38:49] hallelujah amen he that overcometh shall
[38:53] inherit all things and I'll be his God
[38:54] and he shall be my son amen hallelujah
[38:58] now I love this here sorry where am I
[39:02] and I saw no Temple herein for the Lord
[39:04] God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple
[39:06] of it and the city had no need of the
[39:09] sun neither of the moon to shine in it
[39:11] for the glory of the Lord did light in
[39:13] it and the lamb is a light thereof and
[39:15] the nations of them which are saved
[39:17] shall walk in the light of it now I was
[39:18] just thinking now this is not even in
[39:20] the city this is not even where the
[39:22] bride dwells but even just the nations
[39:23] are going to walk in the light of the
[39:25] glory of God hallelujah so it's not a
[39:27] natural sunlight but it's the glory of
[39:29] God will be their light and they will
[39:31] walk in that light now that's just those
[39:33] outside the city how much more those who
[39:35] are in the city Hallelujah they are not
[39:37] just walk in the light but they are that
[39:38] light amen they are there with the lamb
[39:41] Hallelujah that should give us joy why
[39:43] does that make you happy cuz he reserved
[39:45] me a place in that place hallelujah
[39:47] hallelujah I've got a reservation in
[39:49] heaven Hallelujah did you put it there
[39:51] no no he put it there he just had to
[39:53] remind me that that you know you've got
[39:55] a place on my on my ation
[39:58] list Hallelujah and the gates of it
[40:00] shall not be shut At All by day for
[40:02] there shall be no night there and they
[40:04] shall bring the glory and honor of the
[40:05] Nations into it and there shall be no
[40:07] wise enter into any of it that defileth
[40:10] neither whatsoever worketh Abomination
[40:12] or maketh a lie for they which are
[40:14] written but they which are written in
[40:15] the Lamb's Book of Life
[40:19] hallelujah amen when the role is Called
[40:21] Up Yonder I'll be there Hallelujah
[40:24] that's right you know when you think
[40:26] about that
[40:28] the reason the reason this message is
[40:31] alive to you and I I talk about the
[40:33] message I talk you know the message in
[40:34] the Bible are one in the same because
[40:36] the message reveals Christ in the
[40:37] scripture so the reason this has come
[40:39] alive to you is because God is telling
[40:40] you you have a place in that City it's
[40:43] not just to tickle your religious itch
[40:45] or whatever no it's actually God is
[40:47] declaring you have a place in that City
[40:49] that's why there's something in the
[40:50] believer that be wants to become like
[40:53] him with all their heart irrespective of
[40:55] what's going on in their lives you know
[40:56] but there's a reason there's a reason
[40:59] and you know we're not just here
[41:01] haphazardly we're here for a purpose I
[41:04] mean even the even the special song this
[41:06] morning we for a purpose Hallelujah so
[41:08] we're not here just to see you know God
[41:10] knew we would be here he made us for a
[41:12] purpose and he's going to take us into
[41:14] heaven to after we've served his purpose
[41:16] upon the Earth Hallelujah but you know
[41:19] brother Braham says this he says for the
[41:20] gospel is delivered it's good news and
[41:23] this morning the Holy Spirit through the
[41:25] word is bringing you the good news that
[41:27] that from before the foundation of the
[41:28] world God wrote your name in the Lamb's
[41:30] Book of Life all the Devils out of hell
[41:33] can't erase it out of there God's word
[41:35] has done spoke it I like that all the
[41:38] devil's out of hell hey you can run
[41:41] around and Shout run around the church
[41:42] that's fine you know I don't mind it at
[41:44] all Hallelujah frankly it'd be good if
[41:46] more of it happened Hallelujah but you
[41:48] know
[41:50] Hallelujah you know I'm so glad we have
[41:52] little ones God bless I'm so glad this
[41:55] is not great power you know I'm glad
[41:57] there's life in this church nothing
[41:58] against people who are like that but you
[41:59] know I'm glad there's life in this
[42:00] church Hallelujah am mean all the Devils
[42:04] Out of Hell Kinder race it out of there
[42:06] God's word has done spoke it but just as
[42:08] sure to happen as God wrote it in there
[42:10] before the foundation of the world Amen
[42:13] how glorious our heavenly father is in
[42:15] his infinite love and his Mercy uh to do
[42:18] that for
[42:19] us said be ye therefore perfect even as
[42:22] your heavenly father is perfect how can
[42:24] you be when it's not my perfection it's
[42:27] not your Perfection it's his Perfection
[42:29] of his word that he chose you and you
[42:31] never chose him he brought you into
[42:34] Christ and you are secured with Jesus
[42:36] Christ and just as perfect as Christ was
[42:39] before God for you're not standing with
[42:41] your own you're standing in him with one
[42:43] thing I believe God Amen oh I love him
[42:45] oh my on the other side of Eden amen
[42:48] what a wonderful time it'll be someday
[42:50] when you look back down and say why did
[42:53] I fear look at the joy I missed
[42:59] why should we
[43:00] fear why should we worry sure we have
[43:03] burdens for different things but why
[43:05] should we fear he says look why did I
[43:08] fear look at the joy I missed I don't
[43:11] want to miss no joy no hallelu I don't
[43:14] want to miss no peace Hallelujah if the
[43:17] Lord has it all in control who believes
[43:19] their name is written in the Lamb's Book
[43:21] of
[43:21] Life what is there to fear then what is
[43:24] there to worry sure the devil's our
[43:25] adversity he's going to come come and
[43:27] fight us with all that's within him but
[43:29] but we have the power to defeat him
[43:31] Hallelujah that should give us joy
[43:36] hallelujah amen now with all this in
[43:39] mind it should make us walk and talk a
[43:42] certain way Colossians 4:5 he says walk
[43:45] in wisdom towards them that are without
[43:47] Redeeming the time let your speech be
[43:49] always with Grace seasoned with salt
[43:51] that you may know how you um how you
[43:54] ought to answer every man now we know
[43:56] great
[43:57] is a def is a Divine influence upon the
[44:00] heart and Its Reflection In The Life
[44:02] That's from the strong concordance
[44:03] definition right it's not Grace like the
[44:05] world says turning a blind ey to sin but
[44:08] real Grace is a Divine influence upon
[44:10] the heart and Its Reflection In The Life
[44:13] Hallelujah that's why we can say we have
[44:14] found Grace in the sight of God Amen
[44:17] because he has turned our hearts to
[44:18] follow his word and believe his whole
[44:20] word how and and the only way you can do
[44:23] that is if Grace has come upon your
[44:25] heart a Divine influence has come on
[44:27] your heart saying this is my word and
[44:29] I've turned your heart to receive my
[44:31] word hallelujah so if my speech is be
[44:33] always with Grace it should always be
[44:35] with a Divine influence not with an
[44:37] Earthly influence you know we know many
[44:39] times even now you know you know
[44:41] there'll be there'll be bits of what I'm
[44:42] saying is God and a bits that's just
[44:45] me amen that's true just like brother
[44:47] Bram said so much is just a human part
[44:50] but then it's also you know God speaking
[44:52] as well amen but our speech should be
[44:54] always with Grace with a Divine
[44:56] influence Seas them with salt now salt
[44:59] remember we are the salt of the earth
[45:01] but how we speak to people how we you
[45:03] attract you how we speak to people
[45:05] should cause an attraction they should
[45:08] want what we have amen and and I think
[45:11] many times that's the problem is we we
[45:13] we present the message even to our own
[45:15] family that they don't want what we have
[45:17] they don't see it as something that is
[45:19] actually worth living
[45:20] for now sure though you know unconverted
[45:23] man doesn't want the things of God but
[45:25] you know there should be something that
[45:26] you know our Liv should be salty it
[45:28] should attract people that they should
[45:30] look at us and say I want what that
[45:32] person has I really want that kind of
[45:35] Life Hallelujah that's how we should
[45:40] be amen he says and I think God hasten
[45:43] the day that when we as Christians who
[45:45] believe the Bible can prove that uh what
[45:47] we are talking about see uh What uh
[45:50] that's what makes as said a while ago
[45:52] the salt of salt of the earth the sister
[45:55] said that's right the world is for the
[45:57] salt and when we can prove by our lives
[46:00] and by the Bible that our lives are
[46:02] vindicating that word to be living today
[46:04] that's the day we're looking for so the
[46:06] very life we live is a Vindication of
[46:08] the scripture amen it actually actually
[46:12] makes the word the word is living in US
[46:14] amen now I'm not saying I believe we're
[46:16] living in this day amen amen I don't
[46:19] believe it sometime in the future I
[46:20] believe we're living in this day right
[46:22] now amen but that should give us joy to
[46:25] see the word is put on flesh to see it's
[46:27] no longer ink on paper or just on a tape
[46:30] but it's actually living in you and I
[46:34] Hallelujah
[46:36] now as I said a while
[46:39] ago there in Deuteronomy that the reason
[46:42] that that all those curses would come
[46:43] upon them is because uh is because they
[46:46] weren't serving the lord with joyfulness
[46:48] amen and so you know you know and and
[46:51] with thankful Hearts but now when so
[46:54] it's our attitude towards the word will
[46:56] really
[46:57] uh mean what we get out of it and and
[47:00] how we esteem it if we esteem it lightly
[47:02] we'll get that if we esteem it as
[47:03] something very precious amen we'll get
[47:05] really what the word wants us to have so
[47:07] here in Proverbs says hear ye children
[47:09] the instruction of a father and attend
[47:11] to no understanding I give you good
[47:13] Doctrine forsake not my law for I was my
[47:16] Father's son tender and only beloved in
[47:18] the sight of my mother he taught me also
[47:20] and said unto me let thy heart retain my
[47:24] words keep my Commandments and live get
[47:27] get wisdom get understanding forget it
[47:29] not neither decline from the words of my
[47:31] mouth forsake her wait sorry here we are
[47:34] forsake her not this is speaking about
[47:36] wisdom and she shall preserve thee love
[47:38] her and she shall keep thee wisdom is
[47:41] the principal thing therefore get wisdom
[47:43] and with all and with all thy getting
[47:46] get understanding exalt her and she
[47:49] shall promote thee that's go remember
[47:50] this is Godly wisdom this is how we
[47:52] should esteem the word amen amen so uh
[47:56] and and get understanding exalt her and
[47:58] she shall um promote thee uh she shall
[48:01] bring thee to honor when thou Dost
[48:03] Embrace her now remember if we have the
[48:05] joy of the Lord this is how we will
[48:07] exalt the word she shall give uh to thy
[48:11] head an ornament of Grace a Crown of
[48:14] Glory shall she deliver to thee amen he
[48:18] says here oh my son and receive my
[48:20] sayings and the years of thy life shall
[48:22] be many I have taught thee in the way of
[48:24] wisdom I have led thee in the right
[48:26] paths when thou goest thy steps shall
[48:28] not be straightened and when thou
[48:40] runstrom and instruction and
[48:42] understanding is you know wisdom is the
[48:43] principal thing keep her for she is thy
[48:46] life amen it's not a part of your life
[48:48] she is your life am mean so to forsake
[48:50] those things as death but to but to keep
[48:52] her as life Hallelujah well what's this
[48:55] got to do with having Joy well if you
[48:57] have joy in the Lord you want to keep
[48:59] them I because where your heart is
[49:00] that's where your Treasures are I mean
[49:02] so if your heart is not in the Lord then
[49:04] then your Treasures won't be in the Lord
[49:06] but if your heart and therefore you will
[49:08] not um esteem wisdom you won't think
[49:12] much of it right but if your heart is in
[49:14] the Lord then you'll then you'll
[49:16] treasure it you'll keep her because she
[49:17] is thy life amen hallelujah I'm glad we
[49:21] have something that will keep us amen
[49:24] that's
[49:25] right
[49:28] amen
[49:29] hallelujah now brother man says this in
[49:32] a personal experience with God and I
[49:34] just wonder sometimes if we the church
[49:35] knowing that God has promised to deliver
[49:37] the church from its sin and from its
[49:39] sickness and to make us a people a salty
[49:42] people that the Earth will hunger and
[49:43] thirst after I wonder in our human
[49:45] efforts and our theologies and so forth
[49:47] and our um and our great fine buildings
[49:51] and so forth that we tried to present to
[49:54] the people many years ago and we found
[49:55] out it had fail
[49:57] because we took it on ourselves to do so
[49:59] we took it upon ourselves to have new
[50:02] schools to educate our ministers and so
[50:04] forth we left off the real principle the
[50:06] real thing that God told us to receive
[50:09] was let the Holy Spirit lead the church
[50:11] we've left off as we've Lo we have lost
[50:14] our divine joy we have the vision is
[50:17] dull now so if someone loses their
[50:21] Divine Joy their Vision becomes dull so
[50:24] if your vision becomes dull things are
[50:25] not in the right perspective perspective
[50:27] anymore it becomes the wrong perspective
[50:29] because now you can't see the thing that
[50:31] you should be looking at I mean but if
[50:33] our if our vision so if your vision is
[50:36] dull then your vision is not towards
[50:38] heaven no more but you just see what's
[50:40] going on around you and that's all you
[50:41] can see and if you're just looking at
[50:43] problems in the camp then that's all
[50:45] you'll see and then your joy will be
[50:46] gone right but if your vision is not D
[50:49] remember this remember the anointing in
[50:50] this last days is an eagle anointing
[50:53] amen that the anointing of the Holy
[50:54] Ghost upon the church is an eagle
[50:56] anointing anting to Lift Us above all
[50:58] the problems Lift Us above I mean all
[51:00] the works of man that we can see from
[51:02] eternity to Eternity Hallelujah so we
[51:05] can actually be looking from the right
[51:06] perspective amen amen amen so so if that
[51:10] is the case then then we will then our
[51:12] vision will not become dull amen I
[51:15] believe we have been given isav as in in
[51:17] the lady of in church age you receive
[51:19] isav that you can see right I don't
[51:21] believe that our eyes are Meed over and
[51:23] we and and we can't see who we are who
[51:26] God is where we're going amen amen but I
[51:28] believe now that that that the Lord has
[51:30] opened our eyes that we can see who God
[51:33] is amen we can see his character his
[51:36] divine nature and we can see who we are
[51:39] in him that should give us joy remember
[51:42] isn't it wonderful when when when when
[51:44] God would type the bride in the Old
[51:46] Testament oh all those women overcome
[51:50] all those women got their promise
[51:52] Hallelujah you take Rahab she got her
[51:54] family in she didn't perish with the
[51:55] rest of the
[51:57] hallelujah amen you take Esther
[52:00] Hallelujah she overcame her enemy she
[52:04] did not end up dead she did not end up
[52:07] being killed by hmon Hallelujah she
[52:09] ended up Victorious amen hallelujah
[52:12] Sarah Sarah had Isaac amen hallelujah
[52:16] she received the promise though it may
[52:17] have carried she received that promise I
[52:20] mean none of them ended up losing they
[52:23] all won amen hallelujah now that's the
[52:27] shadow we the reality I mean you know
[52:29] Ruth Ruth married Boaz Hallelujah didn't
[52:32] stay a widow Hallelujah so you know if
[52:35] if we can look at the Shadow and the
[52:36] Shadows you know those Shadows should
[52:38] bring us joy why is that because we can
[52:41] see ourselves in the lives of those
[52:43] women Hallelujah of those wom of Grace
[52:45] amen so not you know they all received
[52:48] their
[52:49] promise it doesn't say and hmon killed
[52:52] Esther and then he became king no hmon
[52:55] died Hallelujah and she and she you know
[52:58] used her god-given Authority am
[53:00] Hallelujah so we should you know but if
[53:03] our vision becomes dull we can actually
[53:05] lose sight of who we are in
[53:08] Christ right yes amen so this is people
[53:12] who have lost their Divine Joy their
[53:14] vision gets dull but if we have our if
[53:18] we have Divine joy to me these are
[53:20] linked together this is just me and my
[53:22] little brain if we have our divine joy
[53:24] we know that we have a body waiting
[53:27] amen amen we're not guessing what's
[53:29] going to happen when we die or how's the
[53:31] Rapture going to take place are we going
[53:32] to go we know we're going to go
[53:34] Hallelujah God has put a reality in our
[53:37] hearts a revelation in our hearts this
[53:38] body is going to change hallelujah we're
[53:40] really going to step from this world to
[53:42] the next world I mean so now if that and
[53:44] that should give us a Divine Joy this is
[53:47] not the end this is just the beginning
[53:49] amen hallelujah amen and then our vision
[53:53] should become
[53:54] clear amen that that that we are Sons
[53:57] and Daughters of God Amen that we are
[53:59] not servants we are not the tail we're
[54:02] the head we are joint ears with Christ
[54:04] everything he fell air to we fall air to
[54:07] Hallelujah just like I think someone
[54:08] said about Muhammad Ali you know he
[54:10] would he would train and he would fight
[54:12] great Fighters and he' go through great
[54:14] strenuous battles and things but when he
[54:16] got the paycheck for the you know you
[54:18] know for the for the Bel amen it was now
[54:21] shared with his wife his wife never
[54:23] entered into the ring she never trained
[54:25] she never fought people she never was in
[54:27] the boxing ring she never went through
[54:28] the pressure of the battle me but she
[54:31] received what Muhammad Ali received when
[54:33] he won the battle it's the same thing
[54:34] with us and our Lord Jesus Christ we
[54:36] didn't go to Calvary and die for our
[54:38] sins like we didn't go to hell like he
[54:40] did for us amen but amen everything that
[54:43] he fell ear to we fall ear to because of
[54:45] what he did for us amen that should give
[54:47] us a great joy hallelujah amen we're
[54:50] fall an a to All Things hallelujah amen
[54:54] glory to his name all things not just
[54:56] some things you know God doesn't say
[54:58] some of the words for you and some of
[54:59] the words not for you no every Divine
[55:01] promise of God Is Ours right now amen
[55:03] and brother R says that faith in the
[55:05] finished work of Calvary amen unlocks
[55:08] every Divine promise of God Amen and he
[55:10] put that key of faith in our hearts
[55:12] hallelujah amen amen you say well you
[55:14] know you may think well Lord I don't
[55:15] have enough Faith or you say Lord you
[55:18] know increase my faith Lord help my
[55:21] unbelief Lord I believe help my unbelief
[55:24] like the father said with the epileptic
[55:25] boy there and you know in the gospels
[55:28] and then what did he do Jesus healed
[55:31] him Hallelujah that's why we should
[55:33] never freeze
[55:34] up we should never freeze up when the
[55:36] Lord wants to bring us higher we should
[55:38] never say well I guess I just can't do
[55:40] it and pour me in this way no no keep
[55:42] walking amen keep pressing the battle
[55:44] it'll be worth it all when we see Jesus
[55:47] amen
[55:50] hallelujah
[55:53] amen now the only way
[55:56] that that waterfall feeds water into the
[55:59] other River in lak and is it because it
[56:01] runs
[56:02] over it don't help none that way it
[56:05] don't help none that well but
[56:07] evaporation probably evaporates more
[56:09] water than the water comes down so you
[56:10] know it it's got to run over it's got to
[56:13] be like this hallelujah hallelujah now
[56:17] brother Braham says here he says and
[56:19] who's who is this he says and I'm sure
[56:22] you all had good times this morning at
[56:24] churches around and everything great
[56:25] turnouts and the glory of God that's
[56:28] that uh so that's really good makes us
[56:30] all happy and the best is just a head SE
[56:32] that's right tonight will be better than
[56:34] it than it was this morning we just keep
[56:36] filling up and we just get running over
[56:39] after a while just filled up so full as
[56:41] David said my cup
[56:45] runthe just running over and then you
[56:48] can help somebody else you see when
[56:51] you're running over see it's got to be
[56:52] more than just that fills your vessel
[56:54] it's got to fill and run over Hallelujah
[56:56] so that's why you know that's why we're
[56:58] got to be like this that that waterfall
[57:01] is running over remember we're built to
[57:03] run over do you know that we're actually
[57:04] built to run over we're not built just
[57:06] to be a broken system or some tank we're
[57:08] built actually that the water of life
[57:10] would flow from us freely hallelujah
[57:12] hallelujah so Joy should be
[57:14] infectious Hallelujah imagine if I stood
[57:16] up here every Sunday and said well I
[57:18] guess we'll make it and I don't know if
[57:19] this word's true and you know you know
[57:23] whatever do you think we'll be happy
[57:25] people that kind of thing's infectious
[57:27] but if I stood up here and was like that
[57:29] you say no hold on I don't want to turn
[57:32] into this that's not right so the
[57:35] atmosphere that we actually generate
[57:37] around us will produce something in
[57:39] other people we need to be conscious of
[57:42] that you know if we're always confessing
[57:43] doubt and unbelief and well I don't
[57:45] think that's true and I don't think that
[57:46] promises for us and you know I guess
[57:48] well maybe we've done too much wrong and
[57:50] this will never happen and you know
[57:51] where we came from therefore we can
[57:53] never become the bride of Christ what
[57:55] does that do produce unbel belie if
[57:57] there's double bindingness about the
[57:58] promise it just produces unbelief it
[58:00] produces confusion I mean we should be
[58:02] we should be like no no the promise is
[58:04] true yeah and amen it's for me it's not
[58:08] for someone else necessarily it's for me
[58:10] Hallelujah when I take this Bible and I
[58:12] read this Bible I always take the
[58:14] promises personally I never really think
[58:16] about well that must be for someone else
[58:18] maybe it is for them but it's for me
[58:20] Hall cuz remember this is a personal
[58:21] love letter to me Hallelujah and to you
[58:24] so you know we should always take every
[58:26] promise of God personal and it's never
[58:29] well can I obtain that no the the reason
[58:31] the Lord died on Calvary is that you
[58:33] would receive it Hallelujah remember he
[58:37] made all promises
[58:39] obtainable Hallelujah you just think
[58:42] when the Apostle Paul would said the
[58:43] faith that I now live by live you know I
[58:46] live by the faith of the Son of
[58:48] God hallelujah amen that same Faith
[58:51] hasn't diminished that Faith did not die
[58:54] with the Apostle Paul that faith faith
[58:56] is still alive today am H that faith is
[58:58] still in a people today Hallelujah and
[59:01] if that Faith the faith of the Son of
[59:03] God that he lived by is now in the bride
[59:05] amen I believe it's been down through
[59:06] seven Church ages whether they realized
[59:08] it or not but now it's coming to its
[59:09] fullness Hallelujah so the same faith
[59:12] that said let there be sun moon and
[59:13] stars is in you and I that's an
[59:16] unlimited Faith it's not limited it's
[59:20] not you know you know it's not based on
[59:22] you know real faith is like this amen
[59:24] summertime winter time maintenance time
[59:29] that's that's maintenance time doesn't
[59:31] matter what's going on around it amen
[59:33] it's just bubbling over it's running
[59:35] over Hallelujah and this is how we
[59:37] should be you know the atmosphere gets a
[59:39] bit cold get behind me Satan Hallelujah
[59:42] I'm not going to put up in your freezer
[59:43] you can freeze all you want I'm going in
[59:45] the sunshine I mean the devil tries to
[59:47] put man-made blocks up to try and block
[59:49] your water get behind me Satan I'm not
[59:52] being a little desert place because
[59:54] someone else is a desert place I'm going
[59:55] to to keep bubbling cuz I've got joy
[59:58] unspeakable full of Glory I mean I know
[1:00:00] where I'm going I know the blood's
[1:00:01] washed me of all sin H I know the book
[1:00:04] has come open in this day I mean to show
[1:00:06] me my inheritance to show me who I am in
[1:00:08] Christ
[1:00:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:00:14] amen glory to God
[1:00:17] hallelujah this is how we should be amen
[1:00:19] say well you're trying to push something
[1:00:21] on me haven't you ever had Joy before
[1:00:26] Hallelujah remember walking we say well
[1:00:29] the soul realm has no has no emotion but
[1:00:32] the nature of the spirit is based on the
[1:00:35] soul so if your soul is unbelief then
[1:00:38] that unbelief will become the nature in
[1:00:40] your spirit cuz once upon a time there
[1:00:42] was unbelief in my soul the seed hadn't
[1:00:45] been quickened I had that serpent nature
[1:00:48] in there and so the W so my spirit was
[1:00:51] based on what was in my soul that's it
[1:00:53] if I can put it this way if it's okay
[1:00:55] right but then one day the Lord found me
[1:00:57] and I Surrender my life to him and he
[1:01:00] transformed Me by his Spirit he killed
[1:01:02] that unbelief that sin nature out of me
[1:01:04] and now what's in my spirit the life I
[1:01:07] now live is different because there's
[1:01:09] now Life In My Soul Hallelujah you are
[1:01:13] back however many years I would have
[1:01:14] been a different person not because of
[1:01:16] my age but because of the life that was
[1:01:18] in me then is different the life that's
[1:01:20] in me now hallelujah amen so you know
[1:01:24] there should be so I'm not trying to
[1:01:26] force thing on you but but okay that's
[1:01:29] what I was saying people say well
[1:01:30] there's no emotion in the in the soul
[1:01:32] but the life in the soul will be
[1:01:34] expressed in the
[1:01:35] spirit Hallelujah right it it has to
[1:01:39] push it has to push
[1:01:42] out so if you got God on the inside of
[1:01:44] the inside he's going to push to the
[1:01:46] inside and he's going to be Jesus on the
[1:01:49] inside working on the outside what a
[1:01:50] change in my life who's heard that song
[1:01:52] it's Jesus on the inside working on the
[1:01:55] outside
[1:01:56] oh what a change in my life hallelujah
[1:01:59] hallelujah and I'm sure we can see that
[1:02:02] there there's a change in my life cuz
[1:02:04] Jesus on the inside working on the
[1:02:06] outside
[1:02:11] hallelujah
[1:02:13] amen he says brother Bram I shouted once
[1:02:17] I danced in the spirit don't take that
[1:02:20] no wait till that satisfaction comes the
[1:02:24] satisfaction the poor
[1:02:26] of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes
[1:02:28] in then these Joy bells of shouting
[1:02:31] speaking in tongues and dancing the
[1:02:32] spirit will come you won't have to do it
[1:02:35] by music you will do it when you're
[1:02:37] going down the road in your car you'll
[1:02:39] do it when you're sweeping the floor
[1:02:41] you'll do it when you're driving nails
[1:02:43] in the wall with your carpenter work
[1:02:45] wherever you are that joy unspeakable
[1:02:48] and full of Glory Hallelujah so it won't
[1:02:51] just be a onetime camp thing and that's
[1:02:52] it but it'll be a it'll just pulsate out
[1:02:55] yes sir Hallelujah you know when you
[1:02:57] think about the Lord hallelujah and and
[1:03:00] and and the mighty things he's done
[1:03:02] glory and and I'm not talking about just
[1:03:04] an age level I'm talking about personal
[1:03:06] level am mean the mighty works that he's
[1:03:08] done in our lives he's brought us out of
[1:03:11] many Dark Places he brought us through a
[1:03:13] mighty long way in the wilderness you
[1:03:15] know he's brought us through trials and
[1:03:16] temptations and Dark Places and you know
[1:03:19] the devil on every hand and you know
[1:03:20] he's you know but God has kept us
[1:03:22] through all things Hall that should give
[1:03:24] us a joy Lord you brought me through
[1:03:26] this you'll bring me through that
[1:03:28] Hallelujah whatever troubles I may be
[1:03:30] facing Lord if you delivered me there
[1:03:32] you must deliver me here cuz you do not
[1:03:33] change and if I keep my confidence in
[1:03:36] you you'll see me through amen
[1:03:37] hallelujah
[1:03:39] hallelujah you say
[1:03:42] well
[1:03:44] amen there is Joy it's amazing how much
[1:03:48] the Bible talks about praise and joy I'm
[1:03:50] just going to finish with this comment
[1:03:51] it's amazing how much it talks about joy
[1:03:53] and rejoicing and praise and Worship the
[1:03:56] Lord am mean you go through the Psalms
[1:03:58] you go through the whole scripture it's
[1:04:00] all linked into the believer the you
[1:04:01] know it it speaks very really of the
[1:04:04] Believers just being mournful maybe for
[1:04:07] a season remember joy cometh in the
[1:04:09] morning Hallelujah the Lord wants us to
[1:04:12] be happy he wants us to be rejoicing
[1:04:14] irrespective of trial irrespective of of
[1:04:17] of whever whatever we may be going
[1:04:19] through the Lord wants us to have joy in
[1:04:21] the trial amen hallelujah because even
[1:04:24] even Peter said counted all Joy maybe
[1:04:27] we'll just finish with that scripture
[1:04:28] then he says count it all joy I believe
[1:04:31] I have it here if we can go back fast
[1:04:38] enough no I don't that's in James I
[1:04:40] believe he says count it all joy
[1:04:44] hallelujah amen but whom having not seen
[1:04:46] you love and whom though now you see him
[1:04:49] not yet believing yet ye Rejoice with
[1:04:52] joy unspeakable and full of
[1:04:54] glory amen
[1:04:57] being a Believer is the happiest thing I
[1:04:59] know
[1:05:00] of it really is it has the most joy and
[1:05:04] it has a deep satisfaction you know in
[1:05:06] the world You' try and live on you know
[1:05:10] you want to get back to the pub and try
[1:05:11] and relive that and drunk and relive
[1:05:13] this this party relive that but there's
[1:05:14] no satisfaction to it it's just an
[1:05:16] emptiness and doesn't matter how try you
[1:05:19] how much you try and relive that or try
[1:05:21] and get deeper into it there's no
[1:05:22] satisfaction but with the Lord There's
[1:05:25] real joy and there's real satisfaction
[1:05:28] Hallelujah that you don't walk out empty
[1:05:30] You Walk Out full amen and you want more
[1:05:33] of that again
[1:05:34] hallelujah
[1:05:38] amen you know if we're attributes of God
[1:05:41] God can't lose an attribute he can't
[1:05:44] lose a part of himself he can't it's
[1:05:46] impossible for him to lose part of
[1:05:48] himself amen so where are his attributes
[1:05:51] now his attributes will respond to his
[1:05:53] word amen they will remember deep
[1:05:56] down there will be something in a saying
[1:05:59] that word is true and that's for me
[1:06:02] what's God trying to get you to see you
[1:06:04] are one of his attributes what's the
[1:06:05] biggest fear that that that that people
[1:06:08] have am I worthy and am I going to make
[1:06:12] it isn't it isn't it a big fa and plague
[1:06:15] on our minds am I worthy and am I going
[1:06:16] to make it well let's just settle that
[1:06:19] right now the blood makes us worthy
[1:06:22] amen right the blood makes us Worthy
[1:06:25] amen amen and if that blood now if if
[1:06:29] the life in that blood is coming to you
[1:06:30] and I we have to make
[1:06:33] it because we're sealed until the day of
[1:06:35] our Redemption right it's not a partial
[1:06:38] seal it's not just an anointing but if
[1:06:40] you're sealed into the kingdom now well
[1:06:42] how do I know I've sealed into the
[1:06:43] kingdom it's like the interview with
[1:06:44] sister Bruce she was a real believer she
[1:06:47] was a prayer worry she got burdened she'
[1:06:48] pray for people but then brother bah
[1:06:50] told her that's your nature God uses
[1:06:52] your nature to pray for people you get a
[1:06:54] burden you pray pray pray till is done
[1:06:56] but the devil uses that same nature
[1:06:58] against you and she you know she would
[1:07:00] say to so so that was the Lord anointing
[1:07:03] her life and that was her part of the
[1:07:04] body but then she was saying brother
[1:07:06] Bram there's no place for me to put my
[1:07:08] foot on to see if I've got the Holy
[1:07:11] Ghost she was longing and praying that
[1:07:13] the that brother BR would see a vision
[1:07:16] of when she received the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:17] then he would relate that story to her
[1:07:19] and she'd walk out saying praise the
[1:07:20] Lord that's where I got it and but then
[1:07:22] brother R said one day you're walking
[1:07:24] this way yeah and then but then then you
[1:07:28] started walking this way you walking at
[1:07:29] the Lord and he asked her what caused
[1:07:32] that and she said Christ and he said
[1:07:36] there it is there it is see you're going
[1:07:40] this way but then something turned your
[1:07:41] heart to walk with the Lord what was
[1:07:44] that that's when you received the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost amen so you got to look at your
[1:07:49] life see so she was operating in the
[1:07:51] body as a as a prayer Warrior had
[1:07:54] burdens we were praying but she was but
[1:07:56] then the Devil comes along because her
[1:07:58] because because the devil is using her
[1:07:59] nature against her she's wondering do I
[1:08:01] really have it and and and the prophet
[1:08:04] said well what caused you to go from
[1:08:06] this way to serving the Lord with all
[1:08:07] your heart that's when you receive the
[1:08:09] Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost amen why are you saying these
[1:08:13] things well that's the two biggest
[1:08:15] things am I worthy and am I going to
[1:08:18] make it that's why I said well if you've
[1:08:20] you know if you're trusting the blood is
[1:08:22] enough you're worthy cuz it's not our
[1:08:24] own Worthy it's his worthiness right and
[1:08:27] then the question is well am I going to
[1:08:28] make it and the way to make it is is if
[1:08:30] you really been born again you got the
[1:08:31] Holy Ghost I mean and it can be such a
[1:08:34] simple thing that happens to in your
[1:08:35] life you can stumble over it like like
[1:08:37] she did but she found herself operating
[1:08:39] in the body and she didn't even realize
[1:08:42] she was actually in because the devil is
[1:08:44] using her own nature against her
[1:08:47] amen now I'm not trying to give an easy
[1:08:49] believism because something happened to
[1:08:51] her and now she was actually God was
[1:08:54] working in her life
[1:08:56] but her heart was all she wanted was to
[1:08:58] serve the Lord above all things so if
[1:09:02] your heart is fixed you
[1:09:04] know brother Braham said when his when
[1:09:07] his first wife died in son people asked
[1:09:09] him is your religion are you holding on
[1:09:10] to your religion he said no my religion
[1:09:12] is holding me
[1:09:15] right and so it should be the same thing
[1:09:17] in our lives it doesn't matter what we
