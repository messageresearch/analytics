much for that amen let's go to Hebrews 12 and um we're going to go to Hebrews 12 and verse 18 uh was going to read and then we're going to go to Joshua chapter 14 as well uh just a couple of places of scripture um probably a oh yes I can drive this here we are yes okay so Hebrews 12 and8 we're going to read down to verse uh 24 then we're going to go to Joshua chapter 14 just a couple of places to read uh he says now this is this is the Apostle Paul as we know in the book of Hebrews he's contrasting to the Hebrews the difference between the blood of bulls and goats and the blood of Jesus Christ the the um you know the high priest the natural uh you know you know the high priest and the Levites different things so the high priest of our Lord Jesus Christ he's contrasting many different things and he comes down to this place and he's contrasting now Mount um um SI where the law was given to Mount Zion he says for you have not come unto the mountain that might be touched uh that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which words uh they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but you have come unto Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen then we're going to go to Joshua uh chapter chapter 14 sorry it's got a few more verses here to read trust you don't mind standing for a bit but want to take this as a context here uh this is Joshua he's speaking to to he's speaking to um sorry this Caleb speaking to Joshua about he wants his possession now he says then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of of Jeffy the kenite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and the in Kadesh Baria 40 years old was was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Baria to spy out the land and I have brought him word again what was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I holy followed the Lord thy God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land where uh whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord thy God how did he follow the L holy followed the Lord he believed that God was able to do that which he has promised to do he was fully convinced God's going to give it to us amen now behold the Lord ha kept me alive as he said these 45 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day 4 score and5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake and that day uh for thou heardest in that day how the Anakin were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I'll be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave um Caleb the son of jeffn that's how he said Hebron for an inheritance and Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of jeffa the K kenite unto this day because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel amen amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seats uh this morning and um I just want to I just want to take a few moments to speak on taking our mountain now I would now before I speak about these things I just want you to understand that we are we are ordained to take this Resurrection Mountain that's what I want to call it this Mount Zion is a resurrection Mountain where there will be a people that will Ascend the top of this mountain and they will take a body change now before I speak about these things I want you to know from the get-go there is a people predestinated to stand on the top of this mountain to take the summit of this mountain to to to to possess it to enjoy it and then their bodies would be changed okay so I I I just want to put that before you before I start because it may sound like oh can we do it will we take it will we stay there we will but the enemy wants to drive us off this mountain he does not want us to possess the promise I mean he does not want the bride to be raptured he wants us to to be trapped there because he always wants to hinder God's Plan of Redemption he he's been fighting it from Heaven he's been fighting it all the way down through time he will always he's always there to hinder God's plan right so I just want to read this from Christ The Mystery of God revealed denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve not but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall speaking about the second evil the bride at the end time she won't fall amen she knows it and won't fall she has ordained her Hallelujah few she is ordained not to fall she won't fail she's predestinated to it amen so there's are people that are predestinated to stand on that mountain amen so now I was I was um a couple of weeks ago I was with I was with um brother Daniel sister chery white I took them through the galy uh exhibition there in tapa I thought it would mean something to them being well she's actually a kiwi and he's an Australian and this may not mean a lot to a lot of us because we're not raised from this country but you in World War I the you know the um the uh Western Powers decided they would invade a peninsula right by Istanbul called galipoli and they would they would effectively take this peninsula they march on Istanbul and they and the purpose of this is they would drive the ottoman Turk Empire out of the war and so they they they gathered uh New Zealand troops they gathered Australian troops they gathered French and British different ones and they landed them on this peninsula and now to me this was like the church where where if you look at uh uh this is this is the gpoy Cove or the Anzac Cove and you see it's very steep terrain and the first objective of the war was to take this uh a summit called chanik bear and if they could take that High Ground they could take the whole Peninsula and so it was a very difficult campaign you could see they were landed on the wrong spot they were they had to fight their way up these Hills like this they had to dig themselves in and they they eventually reached the summit of chanuk beer but they could only keep it for a couple of days where the because they outnumbered by the Turks there'll just be Mass waves of attacks and even even there' be friendly artillery fire would actually from the British warships or the British guns would actually hit the new zealanders on the top and it came to a point where they stood on the mountain now take this in the spiritual they stood on the peak they held the peak but they couldn't keep the peak and the church after the day of Pentecost stood on the top of the mountain the church could have been raptured it was in condition now it was ordained we know to go down through the Dark Ages that they would come AB bride at the end time it was ordained that way but they stood on the summit but then the enemy came in and drove them down to the down to the bottom of the mountain just like the Turks drove now this ended in a bitter defeat where where it was a now we know all war is a waste of life but they didn't they did not achieve their goal they they were driven off they were you know you know they couldn't hold the summit they couldn't retake it and there just a bit of failure of a of a campaign and we know that you know the church would eventually after Pentecost the the Antichrist Spirit would come in what would the the purpose of the enemy coming in is to drive the people off the summit to drive them off a resurrection Peak and that's why you know it's so important that we discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit cuz remember we're ordained to take the it and not just take it but to dwell on it right but that doesn't mean the enemy is going to not try and drive us off and push us back down and separate us and divide us from the word and divide us from the moving of the Holy Ghost and so they they they they were driven off the peak eventually they would have to withdraw and the whole campaign ended in a bit of failure and even even when the church would go if you if you read through the church ages there come the Smur and age and that Smur and age that word smum actually means there's a Burness anointed to die and if you take a person who ever gets resentful against the word of God they're not anointed by life and because if we're anointed by the life of the Holy Ghost there's joy there's peace there's love there's a there's a there's a there's a Zeal amen we're going to possess every promise but if you begin to be resentful that's not life anointing you that's the enemy trying to push you off your promise so I say let's never be resentful let's never be bitter let's never be annoyed at anyone amen but let's let's take the peak amen because Luther would yes God would restore now now amen it was like as if they came back to the bottom of the mountain and then God would restore the just shall live by faith you know the church begin to ascend out of out of dark Catholicism out of dark religion and then and then it Ascend a bit higher under under Wesley with with with with sanctification then there's a restoration of the gifts and then God would send Malachi 4 in the end time to restore us back to the top of the peak I mean back to a cycle where the church has come back in a cycle again to be Rapture Ready now all the saints down through the ages are going to be in the Rapture too I mean there's going to be the dead in Christ raised we're going to meet Luther we're going to meet different ones under his message meet ones from the Dark Ages meet those who gave their lives in the Coliseum we're going to meet them all we're going to have a 40 it's going to be a busy 40 days before our bodies are changed too or we're caught up you know we're going to meet all these ones right so there's been the Holy Ghost has been working in every age but there must be a people come to their position come to their position in Christ possess the top the mountain amen and then the dead in Christ will raise so just because we're ordained to stand there does not mean the devil won't want to try and kick us off this is my whole thought for the whole this morning amen so brother Braham says this he knows that since so this is the devil here he says the devil knows that since God is immutable in his nature that he is just as immutable in his ways that Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action is the true church that God claim as Jesus claims as his own all El is false it has to be now remember this Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts so Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come in come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he'll be definitely uh thoughted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them now every every Spirit that's come against the church is against you and I every spirit that came against the prophet is against you and I remember brother Braham gives a principle God takes his man but the Holy Spirit remains upon the the Earth the devil takes his man but the Antichrist spirit is still upon the Earth so Spirits don't die see everything that the that the all the Believers Through the Ages have fought against that same Spirit we are fighting against it wants to drive us off the peak it wants to drive us off this mountain amen that where we are reduced to a place where we're just lukewarm formal and Powerless amen remember we're ordained not to be lukewarm formal and Powerless but the devil wants to make us that way so we have to we're going to make a choice here are we going to be driven off the peak or we going to possess it that no matter what bombardment whatever weapon the enemy forms against us we're not we we're not moving we're not retreating we're standing our ground we're standing for the word we're standing for Unity we're standing for love we're standing for deliverance we're standing for the moving of the Holy Ghost we're standing for Joy we're standing for peace I mean we're standing for love and healing that this is what we're standing for we're not standing for malice we're not standing for division we we're not standing for trouble drama malice Strife Envy unbelief we don't stand for any of those things but we're called to push those things back in the name of Jesus Christ amen so now where it says lukewarm now lukewarm if you look in the webs of dictionary it says lukew means lacking conviction so so Satan wants to make us that we lack conviction that we don't that that that you know that there's nothing in us that actually when when God comes to correct us that we can be changed back to him you know that that that the word isn't important but this word formal if if we look from 2 Timothy 3 says having a form of godliness but denying the power of the from such turn away now this word form it means basically the thing like a mold it's a mere form it's a resemblance you know it's just it's just a shape so like if you pour concrete first you make a mold you put you build a form right then you pour the concrete in we don't just want to be the form having a form we want to be what's on the inside right so we don't just want to look the part on the outside we want to be a believer on the inside right we don't just want to have a form of a church or form of a group of people no we want to be the redeemed body of Jesus Christ I mean where God lives on the inside of every heart there's Revival flame in every life am mean the power of God moving the word manifesting himself but you see what happens is it's amazing how the voice of unbelief can be so strong and how quickly Believers will pay attention to it now we see here where because the book of Acts started when the church was completely sold out to God it was completely on fire for God and that's what brother R says we're restored to okay back to that book of Acts Church there but you see there came a time in Acts 15 where men came in who were professing to be Believers but they were trying to get people back into the old ways they were they were saying you've got to be circumcised you've got to follow you after the manner of Moses otherwise you cannot be saved and you know there was a great um dissension you here it says in verse two here when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them other words other words it was a big argument this wasn't a casual side conversation no no we're going to deal with this thing we're going to talk about this thing we're going to we're going to we're going to iron this thing out they had a big discussion about it but you see it's amazing how people even paid ear to this that that that even a person saying look you've got to you've got to follow what God did in the past now brother brah says that the Pentecostals were good legalists and anyone who's a legalist is living in a former age right anyone who's a legalist is actually still living in a former age now a liberal person there I don't know where they are but someone who's a genuine believer loves the Lord with all their heart and wants him to live that's why it's a heartfelt religion a heartfelt walk it's a heartfelt relationship that keeps you in the middle of the road right so but you see these people come in you've got to do this and otherwise you you can't be saved there's a big argument but you see even even in Jerusalem to me this is astounding There Rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed Saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses now to me that doesn't compute how can you be a believer where the Messiah has come and then now he's poured his Spirit out the day of Pentecost the god of the Old Testament now dwells in a redeemed people and yet you're professing to be this but you're saying you've got to follow the law which they could look in their history the blood of bulls and goats miserably failed and it was meant to the law is only a policeman puts you in jail Grace gets you out right so so it's very you know to me it's astounding that there's this group oh yeah we believe in the Lord Jesus yes we're message Believers but you've got to follow the old way see it's a voice of unbelief trying to push the people off the top of the mountain this is how subtle the Devil comes in where where where he where he comes in this way to push people off the top of the mountain this is what they were trying to do here now so this Antichrist Spirit who that that came in this way desired to make the people formal lukewarm and Powerless this is what he always tries to do he tries to drag the people back into a former age we can see this when Israel left Egypt you know it's amazing the cry it's recorded so many times oh why did you bring us here to die Moses why we're in this desert look at as we heard on Wednesday all the sand and all the trouble and you know there are better graves in Egypt why did we not stay in Egypt and I I want to go back to Egypt let's make a Captain there's no real real record of we're going God's given us the land you see what I mean don't look at me like this like you got a problem on your neck you know there's a lot of people that you know that there's such a cry of unbelief they want to go back to a former age of of slavery but what did slavery do for them sure uh well it didn't do a single thing for them God wasn't even among them as slaves there was all there was was a mournful cry from their hearts God Deliver Us oh the world is so bad oh my children are going sideways oh it's so hard oh it's such a Dark Age oh this is so bad Lord when are you going to come and that was the cry they had in Egypt that was their Worship in Egypt that's all it was reduced to and you see people are the joy bells are gone put the joy Bells back on Amen we're in the Promised Land we've been given all things amen we're not here to just mourn and cry and brother R says sure we should sigh and cry for the Abominations down in the city but on the other side you should be crying with joy thank you Lord I'm part of you thank you you have redeemed me Lord thank you your word is true thank you you're not dead in the Tomb somewhere amen but you see this this unbelieving Spirit wanted to drag them back into Egypt where all they could do is cry and sigh totally totally without help or anything but yet the very God who answered them had brought them out but they wanted to go back I say let's walk with a pillar of fire amen let's not let's not listen to The Cry of unbelief amen but let us let us walk on now the reason they could not enter into the promised land is because of unbelief they had to believe the promise was theirs and they went in but that cry of unbelief of saying let's go back let's go back to a former age let's go back to how it was 50 years ago we live in a different season we live in a different season we live in a season where you know 50 years ago it was God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet now it's what does the word say what has he said we're here to fulfill the word the bride is here upon the scene the word has been made flesh Malachi 4 is introduced the bride to Jesus Christ the Lamb of God the word of God Amen so now it's a different season do we do away with the former season no we don't but now we' have moved on it's not Malachi 4 was not the purpose of the message in terms of the man brother brandham the purpose of his ministry was to prepare a people to meet the Lord that we would become one on this side with the Lord Jesus Christ The Marriage of the Lamb is come it's not we go to the wedding supper we get married this side amen there's an invisible Union that's taking place but you see because of unbelief they could not enter in because there's always a cry there's always a cry you see let's go back I say let's not go back no sir see to them obviously slavery was coming comfortable people can be used to being beaten and downtrod and poor me and just whipped and faced down in the mud and just being the devil's whipping post you can get used to that I say let's rise up above those shackles let's rise up above that unbelief that's not our portion that's not what we're made to be amen we're made to be Overcomers we're made to conquer amen we're made to be God has said we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus amen so this is what he's made us to be I say Amen let's do it amen but you see these Pharisees who claim to be Believers were not born again if they were born again they would never have spoken such things they would have seen the deadness of what they came out of and the reality of what they walking in amen and if you see the deadness of what you came out of well the only way to see that is when you see the New and Living Way you see the reality of the word you see the power of God in your life you see he's transformed you from what you were you may have been a been a proud arrogant message believer but one day God found you transformed your life and that's all burn out of you and you realize that was not the way to live and I'm so glad not that person anymore amen but you see it takes God see it takes a truly a dying to self amen for the fire of God obviously with these Pharisees the fire of God did not come down upon them and burn their old nature out otherwise they would never have been speaking this way see human ability can never give you overcoming power this is what they thought see they keep the law they do this they do this then they can be saved no human ability can never give you overcoming power it's letting God take over and letting him live in your life amen see every Antichrist Spirit against the prophet is still here now let's take a few we're just going to leave that up cuz I've got some other things here see the Baptist would say it's just a see see the Baptist spirit that will try and drive us off the peak says it's just a confession of Faith as as brother Arman said a few Wednesdays ago in his afre English where what he meant was and and I did speak to him so so so this is okay and see what he meant was just believing what he said is just believing is not enough and what he meant by that is just just a confession is not enough see many people identify as many things it doesn't make them thus I could identify as a car today am I a car that's how ridiculous the world has become but you see if I say no I'm a Christian and now I have a testimony God has changed my life it's not just an empty confession it's a reality right because what I believe he's made me I have become by his grace am mean so a Baptist confession just is basically just believe by faith and it's yours but there's no change now that is the biggest edent to the blood of Jesus Christ I've ever heard in my life amen that is such a that is such a nonsense amen where where where see it's more than just saying you have it you possess it what you believe has become manifested in your life amen yeah there we go we'll come to that soon sorry see when we say we've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the True Believer literally has the True Believer literally has had Pentecost amen it's not just a it's not just a a nice idea and there's been no change in life the True Believer if they've been delivered from alcohol they''re being delivered like as I've said I used to brew the stuff now I could live in a brewery and I and I'll be the most sober man in existence CU I've been delivered from that Spirit I've been delivered from you know these kind of things so it's not just me confessing I'm clean no the Lord has made me clean you see but a Baptist confession says yes I'm clean but the desire still there amen so it's not just that we've gone you know no so it's not just yes if you confess it you know then you have it no it must become a reality am mean just like people say well you know we've been restored you know the grain is back again as you know brother BR would say that you know the first church was the grain right there was buried in the ground in the Dark Ages then it came forth Luther Wesley the plant was growing and now we've come to the grain again and brother Ram says now the grain is here it just needs to lay in the presence of the Sun and ripen and so people say look look at the grain there's no moving Parts in a piece of grain you don't see it wave in the breeze like the rest of the plant maybe I should had a picture of a wheat plant you know but you know the the leaves they move the tassel blows in the wind you know the Shook and everything you know you the whole plant can Sway in the breeze when you take the grain put it on the ground I mean I mean put it on there it just lays there so people will take that argument and say well there's no manifestation of the spirit anymore we don't need those things because the grain has no manifestation it doesn't move it doesn't you know the days of Miracles well that was the Pentecost L but we've moved on from that now but we understand that God doesn't take away he adds amen everything that the Luthers had that was genuine we have everything that the methodists had that was genuine we have everything that the Pentecostals had we have amen he doesn't take away right so now people say well you know this is the Grain and you know there's no moving parts that's why the bride is the way she is we've gone past the manifestation of the spirit you know the spirit doesn't move anymore cuz we're the grain I think what nonsense is that because if you take the original grain when he walked upon the face of the Earth what did he do he raised the dead he cast out Devils amen he prophesied amen he brought Deliverance amen God used him mightily it was why the fullness of God and B was in him to bring Deliverance to Open the Eyes of the blind set the captives free I mean so if that was him as one man now he's in a multi-member body what's going to be manifesting the sick are going to be healed the dead will be raised healing will come Deliverance will come the Devils will be cast out the Holy Ghost will be pulled out amen so that is to me the manifestation of the grain what it's him in a multi-member body you put one seed of wheat in the ground you get a whole bunch of the head same same quality same substance same DNA same everything right spiritually now right same thing it's what happened Jesus was one grain he went on the ground brought forth a crop and the church was put on the ground brought forth a crop and here we are all right so don't ever think well you know cuz this cold formal Spirit doesn't want God to have us right away there's always a battle in every Church of Supremacy and in every family and every life what what spirit is going to rule you is it your family spirit is it a religious spirit or is it the Holy Ghost all right amen so you know and and even people will say you know um the Holy Ghost comes without sensation so you can have it and not know you have it and brother BR would say you know the Holy Ghost comes without sensation but he says but the works of Christ are manifested in that person if you take the whole quote and people will say well you know like Mary she was she was found with child by the Holy Ghost she didn't realize it even happened and that is true true but that's not how she got eternal life she had to go to the upper room she had to be filled with the Holy Ghost she had to act like a drunk because the promise had been fulfilled in her life she had a definite manifestation why cuz God dwelt in her and you and and if you won't take that well when she got pregnant with the Lord Jesus what happened her her just like a natural you know like anyone else who's been pregnant your appetite changes some things you love some things you can't stand your walk eventually changes cuz you're walking for two or three or how many you know so your walk changes how how you act change the things you once did you can't do anymore cuz you got to look out you're not looking it's the life in you is dictating to you what you eat what you don't eat where you go what you don't do all those things it's the baby it's the life it's not you you've become prisoner to a baby what about the Holy Ghost now when he comes in right so if you can't even take that second bit take the first bit so her life changed cuz she had a visitation by an Angel but many people say yes I've got the Holy Ghost but there's been no change what's happened but you see and then and then there's the you know the Church of Church of Christ spirit that doesn't believe in you know that comes in among Believers that doesn't believe in the Supernatural but where but where a supernatural God is there's going to be Supernatural things happening you can't keep from it that's why it's got to be that way amen so if there's a super Supernatural God present Supernatural things are going to happen and it's more than going to be an interesting lecture it's going to be more than an interesting song service no Supernatural things will happen I mean I remember when we had I think it was when when brother Tim Dodd was here there was Sister K Moyer was sitting in the congregation in the pre- service just the musicians are playing she had a bad knee and she just felt the prin of God come and touch your knee and totally healed it just in the pre- service well Christine had a bad back a few years ago she's just in bed she's praying God came down and just totally fixed her back why cuz when you the presence of a supernatural God Supernatural things happen amen you just can't keep from it it's got to happen amen just like gon he says now if you stand he says here if God be with us where are all the Miracles the Mighty Man of Valor could refer back to the old word and know it's right because he know that this that God is a supernatural being and wherever a supernatural being is you'll do he'll do Supernatural signs because the Supernatural is in him you just can't get out of it how can you stand in the face of the wind without having the wind blowing how can you get in the the water without being wet water is wet that's the chemical of it it's wet and when you get in water you're going to get wet right and when you get in the presence of God the supernatural there's going to be Supernatural signs Supernatural workings of a supernatural God Amen so we can never get to a spot say well we don't need God to do Supernatural things anymore no we need God more supernaturally than ever before because the devil's running rampant in the end time but then God is R running rampant too amen so because when the enemy comes like a flood God says I'll raise up a standard against them and what is that the promises of God becoming more real to the believer they become more alive they come more stronger they become more strengthened to you why he's raised a standard amen will we believe no my God can do anything Hallelujah we can stand on the top of the mountain I'm being bombarded I'm not retreating from the spot reinforcements are here and they're coming amen yes sir I didn't say reinforcements are coming first because God is already in you Hallelujah I trust we're all happy this morning amen so we've got to know we should never settle for anything less than a supernatural God moving in a supernatural way amen hallelujah that that's our portion that's right amen but you see now it's it's so vital as it says in Proverbs where there is no vision the people perish so we Caleb had a vision that Mountain's mine Joshua had a vision the land is ours Moses had a vision they're going in now so some of us can have a vision but you've got to have a vision you all of us ourselves got to have that same vision this word is true the Rapture is mine I'm walking with God he's come here to redeem me he's my savior he's my comforter I'm going all the way up into Glory that should be the vision of Our Lives amen you know how we how we structure everything should be around that God is alive and he's my God Amen but if we do not have that Vision that's where frustration can come in that's where resentment can come in because you don't see the value of what you're doing in the moment amen but but if you have that Vision you'll see everyday life has a purpose it may be very much same maybe you know maybe Friday was the same as the last Friday maybe Monday tomorrow be very similar to the Monday you had a week ago but there's value in every day if you got this Vision I'm on the King's Highway I'm walking with God like Enoch walked am mean I want to be a blessing I want to be a witness I want to I want to walk with God that everyone around me will I'll be so salty that they'll want what I have then then you're walking in Vision amen you're not saying oh another job and this is the same and this is wrong and no no that is when you don't have Vision you may get frustrated in the every day we all have frustrations we're human but if you have Vision you can look beyond the frustration amen like brother Arman said about you they complain about the sand and the desert and the trouble and the lack of water and all these things but Caleb and Joshua had Vision we may be here but we're not staying here this is not the purpose of Us coming out of Egypt is to enjoy the desert no well not enjoy the desert but we're on our way I me you know I imagine that the that the atmosphere in Caleb and Joshua's tent was very different to cor and Dayan and all the rest cor and Dayan were fussing and backbiting and trying to maneuver things to take over and everyone was complaining look at the sand and where's the water and my problems and my needs and this is wrong they had no vision but Caleb and Joshua would have gathered their family around the table Hallelujah I know I've said it before but I enjoy it every time it comes to mine they would have sat around the table children did you enjoy the Mana Hallelujah yes Dad it was awesome I'm so glad aren't you glad God brought us out aren't you glad that God sent a prophet down into the age with a pillar of fire am mean you see the pillar of fire hanging over the Tabernacle and our God's taking us through and let me tell you let me tell your children you know how I went with the other spies and they would have probably heard this testimony probably pretty much every other day I want to tell you about the land again children because you're going to live in that land it's not just me visiting there one time and coming back we are going to possess this promise you're going to enjoy what I'm telling you is there it's real I stood on it I've experienced it I've tasted it I've seen it I've heard it I breathed it in it's there and you're going to experienced exactly the same things I believe Jehovah God would have stepped into the tent anointed their faith amen bring them as a family unit around Hallelujah yes we're going to take it yes this is not our end sure the winds are blowing the sand and the Heat and everything but this is not our resting place Hallelujah why because they had Vision amen I trust that sure you may be a sandstorm blowing through your life but realize this is not the End Amen this is not what this is not what where you are staying you're going through amen so we must we must always remember that the vision of the the bride is to take a Rapture and the vision of the Bride is to be a unified body the vision of the Bride is to see the word of God manifested in every member the vision of the Bride is to have discernment that we're all here to meet one another's needs every joint supplieth amen this this is the vision of the Bride but you realize the Antichrist Spirit what he wants to do is break Fellowship as as our lord Jesus would say in John 10 but he that is in highing and not the shepherd whose own sheep are not see the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catcheth them and scattereth the Sheep this is what the Antichrist Spirit does wants to break a herd up break a church up break up fellow you know break the fellowship up and this is how the enemy comes in to try and make us cold that a cold church is a scattered church because there's no feeling one for another there's no love one for another there's no care one for another it's just well this is my church this is where I go and that's a cold Church there should be such a warmth of love and care and respect and concern should be such a warmth that that that if we could physically well take the spiritual temperature and make at the physical temperature man this place should be tropical I don't know if you don't like heat I like heat I like sunshine right but but this place should be bmy and tropical and nice spiritually amen but you see the enemy wants to scatter the Sheep now how he scatters the Sheep he always comes in subtly he wants to break down respect for church officers this is what he wants to do because if you do not have confidence in the brother who's in that office amen you will not respect that office and if if you can't respect the brother in the office at least respect the office I mean just like me if you can't respect me as a pastor at least respect the office as a pastor same thing with a pastor's wife amen you got to respect the office that she's in am mean the Deacon's wives remember because if you can't respect the man you won't respect the woman if you don't respect the woman you can't respect the man because they're one amen isn't that true so I'm not you know that's just how it is if you can't respect our wives you're not respecting us our deacons are not glorified babysitters in the back or ushers they're the policemen of the church if they tell me off to speak in the sanctuary I'll say yes I'm sorry I won't say who you are I'm in I'm the no I will respect the Deacon because they're controlling the order in the church cuz we must so we must respect one now there's a reason I'm saying this is that because if you just give respect to the Holy Ghost exactly right yes sir and when you get to doing that then God will go pouring out his blessings Among Us amen just just us little group right here about 50 or 60 maybe 75 people sitting in here tonight if we would just all together bind ourselves together and give Godly respects to God and to the Holy Spirit and to what he's doing in this day and respect every gift and every office that he'll send into our midst then God will continue to pour out his Spirit upon us and we'll grow on numbers and multiply don't you believe that sure we've got to have respects unto God that's the reason I say I want to see God's I want God to pour his Blessing out so much we just cannot maintain it it's just too overwhelming it's too awesome it's too what happened in church I don't know I've got to go see the video again God just took over and not just here but everywhere where just one unified body God moving and power there's a Unity I believe we've never even tasted I mean you know there's more to God and what he can do you know many times we think back at camps and how he's moved in a mighty way to me that's just a little you know that's a sip of what he can do Hallelujah I don't believe we've reached the peak and I don't believe we ever will because our God's Eternal but let's keep climbing the summit of His blessings now we're on the top of the mountain but let's climb the summit of His blessings right why put a cap well that's all God can do no let's not have that kind of an attitude no God can do more he can do the exceedingly abundantly Beyond you can ask or think amen so we must have respect for every gift we should we should treasure every gift every office someone's singing someone's cleaning someone's cooking someone's Sunday schooling whatever it is every part mother father daughter whatever the gift is we say thank God thank God for this gift that's come into our midst let's treasure this gift you're welcome we're all part of the same body amen amen praise the Lord but you see a selfish a selfish Spirit brings division even you look in the Corinthian Church everyone had a Psalm everyone had a tongue everyone was doing their own thing there was no there's no Unity they are all divided they're all carnal it's actually a carnal Church the Corinthian Church and then even when they come to the Lord's Supper he says first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you who who are they which are approved they which are approved of God God would be made manifest among you amen when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper for an eating every one of you take taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and the other is drunken so there's a carnal Spirit comeing what can I get what can I take see there's no waiting one for another see one's hungry the other's drunken cuz the drunken says well I'm going to get everything I can and this court no Unity as he would comeing down here he says wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another so think about more than just yourself don't be so focused on you but be focused on the whole body how can I help and how can I be a blessing Amen to to everyone here you [Music] see where am I up to I'm just going to jump down to this I feel time is gone and you you know worship he's the main thing he was the prophets he was them he was in the Psalms he was in the history and here's the things to come the same yesterday today and forever I mean Hebrews 13:8 if you're writing it down he should be then he should be the principle if that's what he is and we believe it don't we then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking our thinking our singing our walks he should be the Principal theme of of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible's in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think should be Christ so how we treat one another should be how he would treat us he doesn't tear his children down he doesn't belittle any part of his body see Jesus has a perfect revelation of his body just like I know this is my thumb you can't convince me it's not my thumb you can change its color change it shape give it plastic surgery it is still my thumb why CU it's attached to my body and I know it's attached to my body amen just like Jesus he has a perfect revelation of who his body is so therefore how he treats us is how he treats his own body because we are his body amen so it should be the same thing with you and I friends that if he is in us then the things we say do or think should be Christ now Christ does not complain Christ ises not tear down Christ is not negative he's positive he builds up he edifies right brother Ram says one of the worst things I don't know where the quote is just now but he says one of the worst things is a complaining Spirit it tears down faith and you could see that with the children of Israel coming out of Egypt is that their faith was being was trying to be tore down because it was unbelief complaining all the time why this and why Moses and why that and all these things it was it was unbelief had come in so we should never complain it should be such a privilege and honor to serve one another amen it should be the highest thing because the Bible says that that as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are the household of faith so we should do good to all men but especially the household of faith amen so it should be such a highest honor when we have one another in our homes or when we gather together any occasion it should be such an honor it's such a privilege to have you here it's such a privilege to have you here this morning amen as a shepherd of this place I it's such a privilege to have you here it's a blessing for me I'm blessed to see you here this morning amen so we should have that same attitude when we have lunch when we have dinner because worship and sacrifice go hand in hand you cannot have one without the other so remember as John would say how can you say you love God when you do not love the brothers right so how do I show I love God as I love you right so so it's actually how I treat you is actually a worship to God Amen so but we must never lose focus of these things we we must never we must never put a negative slant on anything we do why do I have to do oh Camp's coming up or we're having lunch again or this why do we have to do this see we don't understand the power of lunch amen we don't understand the power see the Devil Wants wants to destroy Fellowship as I said he wants to scatter the Sheep he wants to break down see fellowship with Believers is a supernatural event that's right it's an incredibly powerful event see what is fellowship what do the leaves do it makes it cool when the birds fly under the leaves aha they cool off that's your tree again and he shall be like a tree that's planted see all right where people can come and sit under the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost cool off a little bit you're all flustrated you don't know what's happened where you die whether you're saved or not you don't know whether this church is right or that is right just come under the tree and get some leaves on it sit there let the winds from Heaven go to blowing like a rushing Mighty Wind Through the leaves you know and then what you begin to cool off a bit so you're can to have such a stressful week you have the most precious week of your life you come to church what you you're coming under the those green trees of Fellowship I mean then we go to lunch if you choose to stay or go whatever but you know what's happening cool off a bit more why cuz you're in a supernatural atmosphere where God can minister to you while you're eating chips making a sandwich making a coffee you see God is settling you down amen so it should be really when we step into lunch how can I serve one another you need a coffee let's make a coffee you need some chips hey we're going to turn those fries on you know it should be such a joy say oh there's a mountain of dishes praise God I can wash dishes for the bride of Christ Christ amen praise the Lord you know I can look after the kids I can I can create an atmosphere where God can come down and do the miraculous you say God don't move in Fellowship Simon the Pharisee one day he had a church lunch that's right he was in the wrong church but he had a church lunch he invited Jesus to his lunch the best thing he ever did in his life was invite the Messiah to his lunch Hallelujah and then so they're just having their feast he doesn't realize cuz he's invited Jesus to lunch Supernatural things are going to happen Hallelujah so all he saw was guest lless and food and do I have enough money to pay for the food and what's going to be cooked and make sure servants are all dressed right they've got their orders right and all the entertainment he was just worried about all the natural things he had forgotten that the one he really needed there to make it lunch was coming amen so he was all stressed about those things see he didn't respect Jesus that's why when he came in his feet weren't washed he wasn't anointed kiss made welcome all those things see he came in with unwashed feet but you see there was because he was there anything could happen amen and there was a woman who wasn't invited to the wasn't invited to the feast but she looked through the windows she saw Jesus with dirty unwashed feet and something moved in her heart he was a sinner that needed salvation one of God's children was going to come to the lunch you got to think about the potential of us having lunch here hallelujah and then what what she did she got her ran home got her money got the best um Alabaster Box all those things paid all of her money got the thing somehow got in there I mean got to the presence of the Lord Jesus and her life was transformed while everyone was having lunch now you think about this imagine if imagine if this was us having lunch and we're having lunch there and then because Jesus is walking around the tables as we're having conversation we're building one another up it's just love being projected talking about how good the Lord is or how how he's helping us in our life or whatever we're talking about there's an atmosphere amen and then someone just begins to break down and they give their lives to the lord they're washing his feet Hallelujah and we won't have faces like all these guys like gawking like oh what's going on they Ru he you know she's ruining our whole thing and no it just be maybe just a break out of aaal Amazing Grace Hallelujah why CU God's come down to meet someone at lunch wouldn't you like a fellowship I'd love that'd be cool yeah amen that's not Pie in the Sky that's reality amen so why not then if this could be the potential of every lunch we have that God comes down heals someone touches someone brings brings a brings a you know clarification to something Comfort comes strength comes healing comes Deliverance comes should we not want to have the best attitude when we come to lunch amen amen when we serve one When We Gather Supernatural things could happen amen Eternal things could be imparted lives could be forever changed just while we're sitting around having a cup of coffee amen but you see that's why the enemy fights against Church lunch he fights against fellowship and I say as a Shepherd I feel very lit we must have it I will not Retreat from us having lunch I'll not Retreat from dinner or what or us gathering together I will not Retreat I'm standing right here this is very it's vital where every visitor that comes says to me you're so fortunate that you can have this you're so we don't have this at our church I'm so glad you can have this at your church this is the outside of coming in and so if that's their attitude I I just say thank you Lord I'm so thankful the Lord has allowed this to happen and we can gather we can talk and have fellowship and you know we're blessed so why Retreat from that why have a negative you know sure we can have a bad day but leave the bad day at the door you know I've never seen a sports fan in my life who's a real sports fan or someone who's a Swifty or someone I don't know you know and they'll mortgage their house they'll pay crazy amount of money to go to the go to some sports event they they'll give everything they may have the worst life that they've left I've never seen them sit like this In This Crowd you know they may be going through hell but they're there in front of their God they're they're going in the place they've always wanted to be and they're excited what they leave leave their troubles at the door and they have the and they pick up the right attitude say I'm going to enjoy this this may never happen again this may be my last chance to ever be in this kind of an atmosphere now I'm talking spiritual now you think about we may never have church again we may never have lunch again this may be the end why not go out with a bang am mean why not go out on a high amen why not just say Lord we're going to have an awesome time I'm excited what may happen well God could do anything and if he doesn't I'm still excited because I'm in the presence of God's people amen amen where I can enjoy amen I can enjoy their Fellowship their love and their lives and everything and amen so whatsoever you do do it hardly as to the Lord and not unto men knowing that the Lord that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inherence for you serve the Lord Christ so whatever you do do it hardly and I'm going to finish there I've got I've got a few other spirits that want to drive us off the hill maybe maybe when we come back after the new after the King's birthday but don't let anything break up Fellowship don't have a negative attitude toward don't don't resent anything resent anyone you got a problem come talk about it right let's bring some resolution let's discuss things okay but don't let it create a negative atmosphere we should a positive atmosphere say life's hard that yeah life is hard but we're among redeemers I mean I mean the redeemed we're among the Redeemer we're with him right we can lead off the pressure we can Rejoice we can serve God we can be ourselves amen amen so let's stay on the summit they say we're bombard being bombarded I'm standing right here I got I've been having the worst mind Battle of of my life brother Ben stand right there don't retreat as as as
