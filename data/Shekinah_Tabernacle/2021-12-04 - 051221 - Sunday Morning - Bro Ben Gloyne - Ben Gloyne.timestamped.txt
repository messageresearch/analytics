[44:25] amen god bless you friends you may have
[44:27] your seats uh this morning um i'd like
[44:30] to talk about this morning uh bringing
[44:32] out the best in us
[44:34] now we read here you know the scripture
[44:37] when when we look through the old
[44:38] testament we know that the old
[44:40] testament's a shadow of the new and
[44:42] brother branham would say in christ as
[44:44] the mystery god revealed we um we
[44:46] uh
[44:47] heard it um
[44:49] on wednesday just this but he says he's
[44:51] the principal theme of the entire bible
[44:53] if you read the bible and don't see
[44:55] christ in every verse of it go back and
[44:57] read it again see if you can't see
[44:59] christ in every verse of the bible then
[45:01] you read it again because you've missed
[45:03] something the bible is christ he is the
[45:05] word when you read in the beginning god
[45:07] created there's christ see every you're
[45:10] from that to amen and revelation every
[45:12] word testify of jesus christ so the
[45:15] prophet is telling us if we don't see
[45:17] christ in every scripture we need to go
[45:19] back and read it now there's some bits
[45:21] of the scripture very easy to see him in
[45:22] the old testament you know it's very
[45:24] easy to see him in
[45:26] the life of joseph for example you know
[45:28] he was the promised son i mean he was
[45:29] the favorite son the promised son he was
[45:31] a he was given the code of many colors
[45:33] which represents a covenant you know he
[45:35] was hated hated of his brethren loved of
[45:37] his father you know he was he was you
[45:39] know went down into prison just like
[45:41] christ was on the cross and you know one
[45:43] thief died one thief was saved you know
[45:45] like the baker was killed and the butler
[45:47] was restored or i hope i got that the
[45:48] white right way around but you know and
[45:51] then he was exalted to the right hand of
[45:52] pharaoh just like christ has exalted the
[45:54] right hand admit you know of the majesty
[45:56] on heist it's very easy to see
[45:58] christ in joseph's life but you know
[46:00] this you know there's some some
[46:02] characters in the scripture it's really
[46:03] hard to see see the lord you know but
[46:05] but deep down in them
[46:08] because they are expressing christ in
[46:10] their age deep down in them you could
[46:12] really see them now
[46:14] jacob's a very interesting character
[46:17] you know it's amazing that god would
[46:18] take people such as him and he would
[46:20] express himself even maybe just a short
[46:22] portion of their lives but but it would
[46:24] be it would god would so inspire their
[46:26] lives that when that when moses was
[46:28] inspired to write the first uh first
[46:31] portion of the old testament he would
[46:32] see their lives by vision and god would
[46:34] command him to write this about him and
[46:36] you know so jacob we know his name means
[46:38] supplanter and and he lived up to that
[46:40] name real good you know he was cheating
[46:43] you know he cheated his brother out of
[46:44] the birthright you know as you know but
[46:46] the thing is when when when situations
[46:48] come it brings out really what's within
[46:50] us now i pray that you know when we when
[46:52] we look at this today we're not just
[46:54] talking about good human traits this is
[46:55] goes beyond that it's talking about
[46:57] christ being expressed you know because
[47:00] we can look through there's many
[47:01] accounts of great heroism in the world
[47:03] but it's without god but it brings out
[47:05] the best in people but this is more than
[47:07] that but it's actually bringing out
[47:08] christ and the believer so
[47:10] jacob you know you know when when
[47:12] situations come it really shows what's
[47:14] in someone jacob though he was a
[47:16] scoundrel he was a supplanter he lived
[47:18] up to his name you know he really wanted
[47:20] the birthright more than anything this
[47:22] was this was the central theme of his
[47:24] life though he was
[47:27] the second born though he didn't have
[47:29] right to it because of his natural birth
[47:31] the order that he was born in he wanted
[47:33] that birthright to him it meant
[47:35] everything
[47:36] it meant everything it should be the
[47:37] same thing with the believer the baptism
[47:39] of the holy ghost being sealed into the
[47:41] kingdom should mean everything to us it
[47:43] should be more than who our friends are
[47:45] what our job is what people think about
[47:48] us it should be the main purpose of our
[47:50] life and what i love about jacob being a
[47:53] supplanter he looks for the occasion to
[47:55] supplant
[47:57] because that's what he wants he wants
[47:59] that birthright right and so here comes
[48:02] the occasion esau comes in now esau just
[48:04] thinks well i'm in the message i'm in
[48:06] the church i have it it's all fallen on
[48:08] my luck because i'm the firstborn and
[48:10] you know he felt entitled to it but just
[48:13] feeling entitled to something doesn't
[48:14] mean you it's yours amen but there's a
[48:17] very difference with
[48:19] than just taking something for granted
[48:20] and being entitled then really going and
[48:22] getting it you know the whole human race
[48:24] you could say is entitled to eternal
[48:26] life
[48:27] but those who really want it go and get
[48:28] it
[48:29] hallelujah so that's the kind of people
[48:31] we want to be
[48:32] and so so it came down to the crunch you
[48:35] know and and um and uh he saw he would
[48:38] he would you know he was hunting he
[48:39] didn't catch anything he was starving to
[48:41] death he thought he he wanders into
[48:43] jacob's tent and you know he he says i
[48:45] perish you know give me something to eat
[48:47] and we know these stories really well
[48:48] but let's just go through them because i
[48:50] want you to think about this you know
[48:51] jacob your esau said well i might die
[48:54] what's the youth of the birthright to me
[48:56] because jacob had his occasion he said
[48:58] now i can get it off him now i can get
[49:00] it because now he really because he
[49:02] wants to preserve his natural flesh and
[49:05] that's the carnal believer they want to
[49:06] preserve this thing
[49:08] right but we don't care about this thing
[49:10] we care about our soul
[49:12] right because jesus says don't fear that
[49:14] which can hurt this body but fear him
[49:16] that can destroy the body and soul in
[49:17] hell so that's the kind of people we
[49:19] want to be we're not trying to save our
[49:21] own skin
[49:22] right though if we have to give it you
[49:24] know in death whatever be martyred who
[49:26] cares it's just a body i've got a new
[49:28] one waiting in the heavens already which
[49:30] is far better hallelujah so so so jacob
[49:33] said well oh oh i'll give you this i'll
[49:36] give you this mess of pottage just give
[49:38] me the birthright
[49:39] and so esau because remember when
[49:42] pressure comes what's in us comes out
[49:45] and so esau decided well actually this
[49:47] next meal is more important than my
[49:49] birthright
[49:50] how
[49:51] short i
[49:53] he couldn't see far
[49:55] how short-sighted all he cared about was
[49:56] it there and now
[49:58] and so he sold his birthright for a mess
[50:01] of pottage and it says the bible says he
[50:03] despised the birthright by doing this
[50:05] now you think about it was jacob's tent
[50:08] the only one there
[50:10] they had a they had herdsmen it wasn't
[50:13] just it wasn't just you know isaac
[50:16] and and and rachel or rebecca sorry and
[50:20] then the children and that was it there
[50:22] were herdsmen
[50:24] there were there were a lot of people it
[50:25] wasn't just them there was a lot of
[50:27] people as a community
[50:29] do you think jacob was the only one who
[50:31] had had had afternoon tea
[50:34] he was the only one with food there were
[50:36] others what if esau just said no no my
[50:38] birthright means more to me than this
[50:40] i'll just go i'll find food somewhere in
[50:42] this camp he would have found it
[50:44] but all he cared about was that there
[50:45] and now
[50:47] god help us that we don't care about the
[50:48] there now we have we have long-range
[50:50] vision
[50:52] amen hallelujah brother brahm says this
[50:55] and um if i can find it i really like
[50:57] this he says others in handwriting on
[50:59] the wall he says oh god when we're there
[51:02] ten thousand years as the part said will
[51:04] be no less days to sing thy praise than
[51:06] when we first begun what a time that
[51:09] will be
[51:10] knowing that it's in the near future
[51:13] that we have this great hope and weight
[51:15] with great anticipations on looking upon
[51:18] the face of him
[51:20] who has been invisible in helmets and
[51:22] has blessed us so miraculously
[51:25] hallelujah so the one who's been walking
[51:27] among us
[51:28] god's done incredible things in our
[51:30] lives
[51:31] hallelujah even just to be saved you
[51:33] know have eternal life that's an
[51:34] incredible thing but he's done more than
[51:37] that he's healed frozen shoulders in our
[51:40] midst you know how how how important is
[51:42] it to stay in harmony with the holy
[51:44] ghost
[51:45] you know brother brown said in um i
[51:47] can't oh it was questions and answers he
[51:50] says it's so important he says if you
[51:52] want to see spiritual gifts you want to
[51:53] see god live he says you just stay in
[51:55] harmony with the holy ghost
[51:57] and then so so he said you stay in
[51:59] harmony with the holy ghost so i just
[52:01] came to a conclusion yesterday i said
[52:03] lord anything
[52:05] that causes me to be in disharmony with
[52:08] you
[52:09] i want it out of my life
[52:11] i want to stay in harmony with you
[52:12] because i want to see you live that
[52:13] you'll be glorified i want to be a
[52:15] living witness on this earth i want to
[52:17] see him manifest his power that he'll be
[52:19] glorified he says that if you stay in
[52:22] harmony with god then then the whole
[52:24] church stays that way so it's not about
[52:26] what is this person doing what's that
[52:27] person doing what this dog you just add
[52:29] harmony with god and if we all stand
[52:32] harmony with god he says then the
[52:34] spiritual gifts will just spread
[52:36] but he says the problem is is when is
[52:39] when is when difference comes in the
[52:41] vision comes in as is and our setup
[52:45] now people would say but a setup is a
[52:47] good thing no you can you can have your
[52:50] life so itemized and standardized and
[52:53] you know sectioned off and that you have
[52:55] your own setup that god can't work
[52:58] i don't want my set up i want his setup
[53:01] i don't want my church order i want his
[53:03] church order right i don't want my
[53:05] conduct door to doctrine i want his
[53:07] i mean that that that that god because
[53:09] we don't want to get to such a place
[53:11] that we cabbage down
[53:13] and just go through the motions and god
[53:15] can't live oh but we've had a good
[53:16] church service no i'm not this is not a
[53:19] lecture theater
[53:20] this is not a hall of learning you know
[53:23] forget that i've said in many a lecture
[53:25] probably too many in my life
[53:27] and it gets real
[53:29] yeah and you just try to absorb
[53:31] information and it's real tough when
[53:32] you're trying to learn
[53:34] you know
[53:35] um
[53:36] mathematics and you know and then and
[53:38] the lecture is some guy just walked out
[53:40] of a somewhere and he this droning voice
[53:42] and just writes on a overhead predictor
[53:45] i mean i mean projected enough they do
[53:46] that these days it's just hard but this
[53:48] is not that's the kind of lecture
[53:49] theater i'm used to in the world but
[53:51] this is not a lecture this is where we
[53:54] come in contact with almighty god i mean
[53:56] to see him live so who wants to see god
[53:58] just just spread
[54:00] let's stay in harmony with god amen so
[54:02] let's just purpose in our hearts lord
[54:04] anything in my life now this is that
[54:07] makes me to be in disharmony with you i
[54:10] want it gone because i want to see you
[54:12] live
[54:14] hallelujah let's live a harmonious life
[54:16] with the lord jesus christ
[54:19] because remember god wants to shake this
[54:21] world one more time
[54:22] he wants to live in a people amen one
[54:25] more time hallelujah we can't just look
[54:27] back in history and say well god did
[54:28] great things there this is 20 21 and
[54:31] soon it's going to be 2022 and i'll say
[54:33] this world needs jesus christ more than
[54:35] ever
[54:36] amen people are scared people are
[54:38] worried people are double-minded all
[54:40] kinds of lies and misinformation truth
[54:42] mixed together and you know people don't
[54:44] know where to stand on christ the solid
[54:46] rock you can stand i mean if your life
[54:48] is firmly founded on the revelation of
[54:50] jesus christ doesn't matter what
[54:52] category storm comes through
[54:54] it can be the biggest storm in history
[54:56] you'll just stand like the rock of
[54:57] jebulta the prophet says hallelujah
[55:00] unwavering amen
[55:02] amen so this one that's you know i'm
[55:04] under great anticipations that the one
[55:07] who's walked among us invisible but we
[55:09] feel his presence will see him face to
[55:11] face
[55:12] hallelujah
[55:14] and it says in the book of revelation
[55:15] that they that are sealed with the seal
[55:17] of god in their foreheads will see him
[55:18] face to face
[55:20] i'll look forward to that day that
[55:22] scripture is going to go from prophecy i
[55:24] mean to reality it's going to be
[55:25] manifested then it will be you can say
[55:27] history if i can put it that way but
[55:29] it's eternal but you know what i mean
[55:31] hallelujah so jacob you know it's hard
[55:33] to see
[55:34] the lord in his life
[55:37] he supplanted his brother
[55:40] and then when the time of the blessing
[55:41] came it's amazing how god would actually
[55:43] cause his father who was a prophet to
[55:45] become blinded
[55:46] you know because his bro
[55:48] his father loved esau
[55:51] because he looked after his daddy really
[55:53] well naturally he was a better son he
[55:55] went out hunting
[55:56] and everyone loves free free free
[55:58] venison
[56:00] hallelujah hey amen yes sir i'll be
[56:02] honest everyone loves free venison
[56:04] everyone loves a charcoal bride venison
[56:07] praise a lot so that's what his father
[56:09] loved and so he loved esau but the thing
[56:11] is
[56:12] um his mother
[56:14] inquired of the lord because there was
[56:16] strife you know her tummy would have
[56:18] been going like this there was fighting
[56:19] going on in the womb
[56:21] maybe she saw a foot here and a hand
[56:23] here and all this
[56:24] what's going on here and she asked the
[56:26] lord lord what's going on
[56:28] and it's good when you can actually seek
[56:30] the lord
[56:31] and he'll give you an answer
[56:33] you know i was listening to the sermon i
[56:35] think it's um hear his voice
[56:37] and brother i'm saying is that we need
[56:39] to actually hear his voice
[56:42] don't get so busy in our own lives that
[56:44] we don't you know don't get into a realm
[56:46] where god can speak to us now you can be
[56:48] driving the car remember it's a
[56:49] condition of your heart not it's not a
[56:51] condition of an instagram picture of a
[56:54] prayer closet where there's candles and
[56:56] pillows and everything's nice and you
[56:58] know no no this is not what it's talking
[56:59] about it's where you can walk in such a
[57:01] way
[57:02] that you're in harmony with god that
[57:04] when god wants to download what he wants
[57:06] into your heart he can say boop praise
[57:08] the lord you hear his voice you can be
[57:10] walking along you'll be on your job you
[57:12] can be washing dishes
[57:14] the greatest experience i ever had with
[57:16] god i was washing dishes
[57:18] i was working i was i was working in a
[57:20] kitchen in a commercial kitchen a
[57:23] student hostel kitchen washing up after
[57:25] lunch thinking on the lord i love him
[57:28] i love him because he first loved me
[57:30] that was the first christian song that
[57:31] really anchored in my heart we had bible
[57:33] in schools growing up i went to chapel
[57:36] three times a week at boarding school
[57:37] you know we
[57:39] you know there's the great pipe organs
[57:41] in the you know those songs and you know
[57:42] the angle but just that simple song
[57:45] meditating upon it
[57:47] and the love of god filled my heart when
[57:49] i was washing dishes
[57:51] changed my life because i realize how
[57:53] much i love him because of how much he
[57:55] loved me first that day on calvary
[57:58] hallelujah i was just washing dishes
[58:00] so don't you know
[58:03] there's some people in our household
[58:04] that kind of anyway we have trouble with
[58:06] that and and they're
[58:08] younger than
[58:10] younger than 21 i'll put it that way but
[58:12] you know you could god can meet you in
[58:13] mundane things
[58:15] hallelujah god can meet you in mundane
[58:18] things but sometimes we see something
[58:19] we've got to do and we just kind of roll
[58:21] our eyes and say oh why do i have to do
[58:24] this look at it as an opportunity for
[58:27] god to meet you
[58:28] you say well it's my numbing work no no
[58:30] no it's only my numbing if you look at
[58:33] it that way you say no it's an
[58:34] opportunity lord i can actually have a
[58:36] conference with you
[58:38] while i'm doing this mundane work
[58:41] praise god so you know look for god in
[58:43] everything
[58:45] amen so so here comes uh yeah so um
[58:49] there yeah rachel no sorry rebecca
[58:52] god was told because this was going on
[58:54] in her womb because jacob and esau were
[58:56] fighting
[58:57] god told her that there's two nations in
[58:59] your womb they're striving but but she
[59:03] was told the elder shall serve the
[59:05] younger yes
[59:07] so she had in her heart
[59:09] sure there's two boys coming out but
[59:11] it's the younger one that's going to be
[59:13] the main one
[59:14] hallelujah and then so now there came
[59:17] the time but but of course um
[59:19] um isaac loved esau because of the free
[59:22] venison
[59:23] because he was more of a man's man you
[59:25] know the scripture says that that jacob
[59:27] was a plain man he dwelt in tents
[59:30] you know he probably didn't spend a lot
[59:31] of time out in the fields with the
[59:33] flocks and doing here's a plain man the
[59:34] scripture says and so
[59:37] but then the thing is the time of the
[59:38] blessing came
[59:40] and because because um jacob wanted the
[59:43] birthright he wanted the blessing he
[59:45] wasn't just satisfied just with the
[59:46] birthright he wanted everything that
[59:48] goes with it
[59:49] hallelujah so he was willing to deny
[59:51] himself
[59:53] put on put on the persona of his older
[59:56] brother
[59:56] just like us we have you know we are
[59:59] born wrong
[1:00:01] right but if we just
[1:00:03] and you know the devil says you're not
[1:00:05] worthy
[1:00:06] and i can agree with him on that that's
[1:00:08] the one thing i can agree with him on
[1:00:10] everything else is no
[1:00:12] but the reason but doesn't mean i kind
[1:00:14] of listen to him after he says that
[1:00:16] because he says you're not worthy
[1:00:18] therefore you can't get it i say yes i'm
[1:00:20] not worthy but i've got an older brother
[1:00:24] holly that is worthy
[1:00:26] amen and he's worthy to go before the
[1:00:28] throne of grace and get
[1:00:30] whatever he asked for
[1:00:32] hallelujah and if we go in his name
[1:00:34] which is going in his dead
[1:00:37] this i greet you in the name of the lord
[1:00:38] jesus christ that's a powerful greeting
[1:00:41] so all all the crisis i'm greeting you
[1:00:43] in
[1:00:44] all that heaven is i'm greeting you in
[1:00:47] so he put on eso's clothes because
[1:00:49] remember his mother knew that ella is
[1:00:51] going to serve the younger so her whole
[1:00:53] life was now governed around that
[1:00:55] and so when the time of the blessing was
[1:00:57] going to come she's like listen i heard
[1:00:58] this you know jacob put on put on esau's
[1:01:01] clothes and we'll get kids skins and put
[1:01:03] them onto your hairy and different
[1:01:04] things and you know he walks in with not
[1:01:06] even venison it was something else that
[1:01:08] his mother had made and then but he was
[1:01:11] jake um jacob was such a man
[1:01:13] that his own fear of being exposed was
[1:01:16] secondary to getting the blessing
[1:01:19] hallelujah because remember his daddy
[1:01:21] was a prophet
[1:01:22] he was there and he saw he saw the
[1:01:24] stairway to heaven
[1:01:26] there at bethel god spoke to him just
[1:01:29] because he was physically blind it
[1:01:31] didn't mean he wasn't spiritually blind
[1:01:33] but god and you know so so jacob did not
[1:01:36] know is god just going to expose me when
[1:01:38] i walk in because that could have
[1:01:39] happened you know isaac could have been
[1:01:42] lying down there and you know and then
[1:01:43] and then uh jacob would have come in i'm
[1:01:45] you saw you know and then and then isaac
[1:01:48] could have sat up pointed his finger at
[1:01:49] him said you you deceiver
[1:01:52] i cursed you in the name of god he could
[1:01:54] have done that how dare you come and try
[1:01:56] and get your get your brother's blessing
[1:01:58] that could have happened
[1:02:00] but god blinded god blinded his father's
[1:02:03] eyes
[1:02:04] so that jacob could get the blessing
[1:02:08] hallelujah why because jacob was willing
[1:02:10] because he would have gone in there in
[1:02:11] fear
[1:02:12] what if i get exposed what if i die
[1:02:14] today what if god just kills me
[1:02:17] but his desire for the birthright was
[1:02:19] greater than any fear that was in the
[1:02:21] back of his mind
[1:02:23] and it should be the same thing with you
[1:02:25] and i what if god doesn't doesn't
[1:02:27] receive me what if my sins get called
[1:02:29] out what if this and this and this and
[1:02:30] what if what will this person think of
[1:02:32] me what will my family say of me what
[1:02:34] will my friends say of me what will my
[1:02:36] colleagues say of me he didn't care
[1:02:38] about that
[1:02:39] i want the blessing
[1:02:41] i want the blessing of god i want the
[1:02:43] blessing of god to rest upon my life
[1:02:45] because what god is blessed is blessed
[1:02:47] and he cannot reverse his blessing
[1:02:49] hallelujah so he went in there he denied
[1:02:52] his own self
[1:02:53] when i went clothed as esau and said i
[1:02:56] am esau
[1:02:57] and we have to go before the prince of
[1:02:59] god that way
[1:03:00] we're not worthy we don't deserve it i
[1:03:02] remember we say you but you deny
[1:03:04] yourself
[1:03:05] go and say i am worthy
[1:03:08] hallelujah
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] so he got the blessing
[1:03:14] so
[1:03:15] naturally
[1:03:16] we can if we can look at his actions we
[1:03:18] say
[1:03:19] where is christ in that
[1:03:21] where is actually the attributes of of
[1:03:24] our great lord jesus in his life
[1:03:26] but you see
[1:03:28] none of this came into being until his
[1:03:30] eyes fell upon a certain woman
[1:03:33] hallelujah
[1:03:35] amen when he saw rachel because remember
[1:03:37] he had to run for his life after that
[1:03:39] esau swore that as soon as isaac's dead
[1:03:42] i'm going to kill my brother so he had
[1:03:43] to run for his life
[1:03:46] and he went down to where where rebecca
[1:03:48] came from went to his you know family
[1:03:51] there and and when he saw rachel he fell
[1:03:54] in love with her yes
[1:03:56] and now laban is an interesting
[1:03:58] character
[1:03:59] god's amazing
[1:04:01] the bad character traits in in us
[1:04:05] we can always we'll meet our match
[1:04:06] somewhere
[1:04:08] hello we'll meet our match somewhere
[1:04:11] here was jacob
[1:04:12] he was a supplanter
[1:04:14] he come to find out his father-in-law
[1:04:17] changed his wages 10 times
[1:04:20] god knows how to outmatch us with
[1:04:22] someone remember we are all god's agents
[1:04:25] for our for each other
[1:04:27] iron sharpens iron
[1:04:30] hallelujah fellowship there's rubbing
[1:04:32] that's why we can't be christians you
[1:04:34] know we can't be christians isolated
[1:04:36] somewhere it takes it takes the rubbing
[1:04:38] of humanity
[1:04:40] hallelujah i'm just like children
[1:04:42] they're god's agents
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:45] oh my you know it's funny it's funny you
[1:04:48] know you meet the lord
[1:04:50] before you get married you think man uh
[1:04:52] i've arrived
[1:04:54] and then you get married you say lord
[1:04:56] help me and then and then eventually
[1:04:58] because it's actually your own character
[1:05:00] flaws coming out it's things that you
[1:05:02] need you know and then you get to a
[1:05:04] place praise the lord and then and then
[1:05:06] the first one arrives and you cannot
[1:05:08] negotiate with a six-month-old
[1:05:11] it just doesn't work if they're sore
[1:05:13] they tell you if they're hungry they
[1:05:15] tell you if they need changing they tell
[1:05:16] you if they can't sleep they tell you
[1:05:17] you know and you can't just say no hold
[1:05:19] on this is not reasonable this is not
[1:05:21] rational no it doesn't work and then you
[1:05:23] begin to see
[1:05:25] walking on two feet is your own
[1:05:27] character
[1:05:28] and it's not you looking in the mirror
[1:05:29] by the way they're about this tall
[1:05:32] the good and the bad
[1:05:33] but for some reason there's something
[1:05:35] about humanity the bad seems to outweigh
[1:05:37] the good
[1:05:38] in our own little minds
[1:05:40] are we are we together
[1:05:42] are we together
[1:05:43] and you know but what are they they're
[1:05:45] god's agents
[1:05:47] because god is doing a work many times
[1:05:49] we pray for our children lord help them
[1:05:51] but really it's helped me
[1:05:53] hallelujah lord i need help they need i
[1:05:56] probably need more help than them
[1:05:58] praise god
[1:06:00] why what happens is because you begin to
[1:06:02] your match may be this tall
[1:06:04] but it's not the size of the package
[1:06:08] it's what's in the package
[1:06:10] hallelujah
[1:06:11] anyway so so so laban
[1:06:15] jacob met his match in lebanon
[1:06:17] he would change his way just 10 times
[1:06:20] you know sure you know
[1:06:22] jacob being jacob he would try and you
[1:06:24] know you know trick him out of
[1:06:25] everything got the best cattle different
[1:06:27] things but laban he was a real match
[1:06:30] but the amazing thing is is that when
[1:06:32] when when real love came in
[1:06:35] we read there in verse 20
[1:06:37] he served seven years for rachel
[1:06:40] and they seemed unto him but a few days
[1:06:43] for the love he had to her you think
[1:06:45] about he was a man who was who used to
[1:06:47] dwell in tents
[1:06:48] he was as he he was a real mama's boy
[1:06:52] you know he was he was her favorite son
[1:06:54] and
[1:06:55] so
[1:06:56] maybe he didn't spend a lot of time with
[1:06:57] animals but here he was it's amazing
[1:07:01] love can lift us above
[1:07:03] everyday life you know what i love about
[1:07:05] this is this really brings out christ
[1:07:08] in in jacob it really it goes beyond his
[1:07:12] humanity and goes down to really who he
[1:07:15] really is
[1:07:17] just like esau sold his birthright for a
[1:07:19] mess of pottage that brought out who he
[1:07:21] really was
[1:07:22] so now when love comes into the equation
[1:07:24] in jacob's life
[1:07:26] it shows who he really is
[1:07:30] now i say this i hope jacob did not stop
[1:07:32] loving her and the trials did not get
[1:07:35] more grievesome after they got married
[1:07:38] i hope it just seemed but a few days
[1:07:40] and everything was fine because remember
[1:07:42] this was seven years out in the elements
[1:07:44] he didn't have some big shed to put the
[1:07:46] sheep in
[1:07:47] you need to follow them around you know
[1:07:49] he had to you know in the rain in the
[1:07:51] cold in the baking hot sun
[1:07:54] whatever it was you know but it seemed
[1:07:56] but a few days
[1:07:59] because of the love he had for her amen
[1:08:02] amen as i say i trust that brothers
[1:08:06] when you're courting your wives it's
[1:08:08] just a few that day all the family
[1:08:10] things going on and it's just but it
[1:08:12] seemed just a few days but i trust that
[1:08:14] didn't change after you got married it
[1:08:16] just got greater
[1:08:17] i mean that the love that you have gets
[1:08:19] greater and what should it do it should
[1:08:21] bring out more of christ in you right
[1:08:24] they shouldn't now bring out you know
[1:08:25] you shouldn't walk down the aisle one
[1:08:28] man
[1:08:29] and then wake up the next morning a
[1:08:30] different man
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:33] i love you sweetheart you're darling all
[1:08:35] these nice things and then and then you
[1:08:37] wake up the next morning and you're back
[1:08:38] to your old self no no
[1:08:41] it should bring out what's within you
[1:08:43] it should be more love
[1:08:45] more of the lord
[1:08:47] hallelujah
[1:08:49] amen that's how it should be so jacob
[1:08:51] you know even so so the love that he had
[1:08:55] amen made those seven years seem but a
[1:08:58] few days
[1:09:00] praise god
[1:09:02] here we are now see
[1:09:06] love should bring out the best in us
[1:09:09] it should bring out the character of
[1:09:11] christ because remember he was because
[1:09:13] the you know paul would say in hebrews
[1:09:15] 12 1
[1:09:16] wherefore seeing where also compassed
[1:09:18] about was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:09:20] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:09:22] sin which does so easily beset us and
[1:09:25] let us run with patience the race that
[1:09:26] is set before us looking unto jesus the
[1:09:29] author and finisher of our faith who for
[1:09:31] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:09:34] the cross despising the shame and has
[1:09:37] set down at the right hand of the throne
[1:09:39] of god so that you know i know i've said
[1:09:41] this a lot but there's a joy set before
[1:09:43] him and there's a joy set before jacob
[1:09:45] i'm getting married
[1:09:47] i love her we're gonna get married sure
[1:09:49] i've gotta work seven years but we're
[1:09:51] gonna get married and you know the lord
[1:09:53] has been interceding for us for
[1:09:56] you know there's been seven church ages
[1:09:58] but there's a joy set before him even
[1:10:00] when he went to calvary there was a joy
[1:10:02] set before him
[1:10:03] you know and that joy was us redeemed
[1:10:06] you know would say in the theater's
[1:10:07] dictionary the definition of joy
[1:10:09] it's joy or gladness it's a joy received
[1:10:12] from you
[1:10:13] it's the cause or occasion of joy so
[1:10:16] there's a cause in his life that this
[1:10:19] joy was a cause
[1:10:21] i've got a bride
[1:10:23] i'm gonna make her in my image
[1:10:25] i'm gonna purchase her i'm gonna pull my
[1:10:27] life out upon the earth i'm gonna give
[1:10:28] my all amen that joy
[1:10:31] made it seem that the great trial he was
[1:10:34] going to go through being marred more
[1:10:35] than any man
[1:10:36] he'll be marred beyond recognition
[1:10:39] amen he would be bruised for our
[1:10:41] iniquities you know the devil would
[1:10:43] anoint those soldiers to beat him like
[1:10:45] they never beat another prisoner and
[1:10:47] whip him and you know they would he
[1:10:48] would anoint the pharisees to pull out
[1:10:50] his bed and spit in his face and mock
[1:10:52] him and make fun and you know all those
[1:10:54] horrible things that he had to go
[1:10:55] through
[1:10:56] and even you know and then jesus would
[1:10:59] even come to a place where he would he
[1:11:00] would feel so forsaken on the cross he'd
[1:11:02] cry out my god my god why is that
[1:11:04] forsaken me
[1:11:05] but yet he had a joy before him
[1:11:08] and that joy far outweighed amen his
[1:11:11] present circumstances
[1:11:13] the then and now didn't mean too much to
[1:11:14] him it was it was the joy
[1:11:17] that was coming
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] amen so there was an occasion he was
[1:11:22] looking for
[1:11:23] and that gave him great joy we know that
[1:11:25] that that greater k that great occasion
[1:11:28] was now he was going to come and dwell
[1:11:29] on his disciples that he loved and not
[1:11:31] just that he was going to redeem a
[1:11:32] people down through seven church ages
[1:11:34] and they were going to be gathered
[1:11:35] around the throne hallelujah you know
[1:11:38] how god's under expectation
[1:11:40] we're under expectation we want to see a
[1:11:42] body change we want to see the dead in
[1:11:43] christ rise but our god is under
[1:11:45] expectation for that moment he's been
[1:11:47] waiting for thousands of years for this
[1:11:49] moment i mean ever since that he he
[1:11:51] would stand in the garden and he would
[1:11:53] speak to adam and eve and you know enter
[1:11:55] the serpent and he would give the first
[1:11:56] prophecy of the redeemer coming
[1:11:58] hallelujah he's been under expectation
[1:12:00] to see it unfold he knows how it's going
[1:12:02] to end up but you know it's like a great
[1:12:04] artist they have in their mind what
[1:12:06] they're going to paint
[1:12:07] but when it actually becomes material
[1:12:09] before them
[1:12:11] that the thing they had in their mind
[1:12:13] becomes material
[1:12:15] then they can rejoice
[1:12:17] because it's now expressed
[1:12:18] the same thing with god
[1:12:20] in the back part of his mind was
[1:12:22] redemption
[1:12:23] was you and i being redeemed
[1:12:25] hallelujah and he knew what would look
[1:12:27] like and he knew our character traits
[1:12:29] and knew how tall we'd be and he knew
[1:12:31] the struggles would go through he knew
[1:12:33] everything we'd go through but yet and
[1:12:36] and even with all that he knew that you
[1:12:38] would one day
[1:12:39] in his timing say yes
[1:12:43] hallelujah and he knew that you would
[1:12:45] actually lay it all down
[1:12:47] and say yes
[1:12:49] and he knew that there would come many
[1:12:51] points in your life where you wouldn't
[1:12:53] know which way to turn your turn to him
[1:12:55] and he would guide you through
[1:12:58] hallelujah and he also knew amen that
[1:13:01] there will come a time when you step
[1:13:02] from this dimension to the next
[1:13:03] dimension
[1:13:05] you think we're excited for that moment
[1:13:07] now we can only imagine what it's going
[1:13:09] to be like you know the prophet could go
[1:13:12] beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:13:13] described that world it's sublime
[1:13:16] you know or he would he would he would
[1:13:18] rather describe the condition of the
[1:13:19] people in the green grass and all those
[1:13:21] things
[1:13:22] but that but the atmosphere and the
[1:13:24] feeling of the place
[1:13:25] that's what he couldn't fully describe
[1:13:27] he said it's it's above sublime
[1:13:30] it's the greatest place he he just
[1:13:32] couldn't there was not words to describe
[1:13:35] that land beyond the river
[1:13:37] and he said whatever you do
[1:13:40] don't miss it lay aside everything till
[1:13:42] you get perfect love which is the holy
[1:13:43] ghost and get to that land
[1:13:45] so it was easy for him to describe the
[1:13:47] people in their condition but the
[1:13:49] atmosphere
[1:13:51] hallelujah you think of place there's no
[1:13:53] sorrow pain or death this is a real
[1:13:55] world it's more real than this world
[1:13:56] there's no devil there's no bad thoughts
[1:13:58] there's no sickness there's no sorrow
[1:14:00] there's no separation death can't enter
[1:14:02] there there's no separation there's not
[1:14:04] a bad day there's not a bad week there's
[1:14:06] not a trial there's not any tribulation
[1:14:08] no trouble nothing the devil's not there
[1:14:11] that's nothing it's like the best day
[1:14:13] you can imagine but time's a billion
[1:14:16] hallelujah he says make sure you get to
[1:14:18] that land
[1:14:19] and that's why jesus died to get to that
[1:14:21] land i mean that we would get to that
[1:14:23] land but you see now the lord he's
[1:14:25] already seen it
[1:14:27] just like a vision
[1:14:28] a vision brother brown would see what's
[1:14:30] going to happen in the vision that he'd
[1:14:31] walk into the vision
[1:14:33] right so a prophet who can see a vision
[1:14:36] sees the future before it happens
[1:14:39] and that's god just just showing that
[1:14:40] man or woman what's going to happen
[1:14:43] right so now when the lord the lord's
[1:14:46] already seen the rapture
[1:14:47] he's already seen us round the throne
[1:14:50] hallelujah he's already seen it because
[1:14:52] the works are finished before the
[1:14:54] foundation of the world the apostle paul
[1:14:56] said so he's not just imagining it like
[1:14:59] we do he's already seen it
[1:15:01] so now he's coming he's watching it
[1:15:03] become more material all the time
[1:15:06] hallelujah and now to me that would make
[1:15:09] that would make me real excited if i was
[1:15:11] in his shoes
[1:15:13] hallelujah
[1:15:14] soon and very soon we're going to see
[1:15:16] the king
[1:15:17] amen so you think we're going to be
[1:15:18] excited that day he's going to be
[1:15:20] excited our guy's not a robot
[1:15:23] he's not some just um you know something
[1:15:25] like
[1:15:26] cold
[1:15:27] indifferent he has feelings
[1:15:30] hallelujah he's not indifferent towards
[1:15:32] us the bible says that he takes pleasure
[1:15:34] in his people
[1:15:37] he delights in our prayers the bible
[1:15:38] says
[1:15:40] hallelujah he actually cares for you and
[1:15:42] i
[1:15:42] yes amen he's not indifferent he's not
[1:15:44] some just some like a working
[1:15:46] relationship doesn't care about us we're
[1:15:48] the apple of his eye
[1:15:50] we're the redeemed of the ages
[1:15:52] hallelujah you know many times we go
[1:15:55] back to the back to the time when we
[1:15:57] first meet and we think lord why did i
[1:15:58] meet you earlier
[1:16:00] we just had a few years upon the earth
[1:16:02] which is not even a i don't know how
[1:16:03] long in god's time
[1:16:05] and he's been waiting thousands of years
[1:16:07] for us to come here for us to express
[1:16:09] himself to us
[1:16:10] hallelujah
[1:16:13] the reason i say that is because we get
[1:16:15] excited when we see someone we love
[1:16:18] he's been waiting a lot longer than
[1:16:19] we've ever waited for someone
[1:16:22] hallelujah
[1:16:24] amen so the great joy
[1:16:26] so jacob could express christ there
[1:16:29] because of his love for his bride-to-be
[1:16:33] hallelujah
[1:16:34] now
[1:16:36] i pray that we would be the same way
[1:16:39] when we when we see
[1:16:41] even each other or our families
[1:16:44] that the love we have for one another
[1:16:46] which should be the love of god not just
[1:16:48] human love that goes up and down or the
[1:16:51] love we have for our children for our
[1:16:52] families it would bring out the best in
[1:16:55] us
[1:16:56] maybe before we became a christian maybe
[1:16:58] we were like jacob
[1:17:00] we cheated we did everything we could
[1:17:01] maybe even when we when we came in among
[1:17:03] believers
[1:17:04] we became that way but then when the but
[1:17:07] then when we really met god
[1:17:10] because of love
[1:17:11] you think yo
[1:17:13] jacob had seven years of hardship
[1:17:17] but love lifted him up above the
[1:17:19] hardship
[1:17:20] we're living in a very troublesome time
[1:17:24] in a time of trouble we've been reading
[1:17:25] about it for years in the scripture now
[1:17:27] we're here
[1:17:28] right now we're living in this time of
[1:17:30] trouble but does the love of god lift us
[1:17:33] up
[1:17:34] above the trouble does it lift us up
[1:17:36] above the storm it doesn't mean the
[1:17:38] storm stops it's still there
[1:17:41] we can be standing in the middle of it
[1:17:43] but does the love of god lift us up that
[1:17:45] we don't get caught up in the storm but
[1:17:46] we can just keep walking on
[1:17:52] you know jacob
[1:17:54] would
[1:17:54] after this when he went back to his
[1:17:57] brother
[1:17:59] he was still a supplanter
[1:18:01] he was still a deceiver
[1:18:03] he even sent his own family that's why i
[1:18:05] said it's a small window in his life
[1:18:06] where you can really see god
[1:18:08] because when he's going back to esau
[1:18:10] going back to where because because the
[1:18:12] lord told him you got to return home now
[1:18:15] and then so he gets a report that esau's
[1:18:17] got 400 men waiting for him
[1:18:19] and remember when they parted ways it
[1:18:21] wasn't i love you see you bro i'll come
[1:18:24] back soon he ran for his life
[1:18:26] and there's something in human nature we
[1:18:28] we we just hold grudges
[1:18:31] you know carnal man holds on to things
[1:18:33] they just can't let it go but a
[1:18:35] christian can
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:37] and so and so jacob is such a deceiver
[1:18:40] he said yo he would rather push his own
[1:18:42] flesh and blood in front of him
[1:18:44] than actually go first and actually meet
[1:18:46] his brother
[1:18:47] he sent the flocks to try and buy him
[1:18:49] off and he sent his children
[1:18:52] and his wives
[1:18:54] first
[1:18:55] so where is he in that where's god in
[1:18:57] that i mean yo where's the christ-like
[1:18:59] character in that we should be in the
[1:19:01] front
[1:19:02] we should be the shield
[1:19:04] hallelujah but you see it's just that
[1:19:06] small window but because of love
[1:19:09] it seemed but a few days
[1:19:12] lord jesus may we be the same way
[1:19:15] may we be the same way that our lives
[1:19:19] because of divine
[1:19:20] love amen
[1:19:23] that the trouble sure we have troubles
[1:19:25] we're not exempt from troubles we're not
[1:19:26] exempt from hardship but we can live
[1:19:28] such a life
[1:19:30] that those things don't bog us down it
[1:19:32] should just take us in prayer to god
[1:19:37] what i love about the scripture is it's
[1:19:38] not just
[1:19:40] god being expressed
[1:19:42] you know so so
[1:19:44] god brings out the best in us
[1:19:46] but we can live in such a way we bring
[1:19:48] the best out in god
[1:19:51] you know the scripture would tell us of
[1:19:52] of of abigail
[1:19:55] she was married to a man
[1:19:58] called nabel
[1:20:00] and there came a situation where where
[1:20:02] david and his men were actually camping
[1:20:04] around where nabel and his flocks and
[1:20:06] his and his farms were and they were
[1:20:09] like a wall protecting protecting naval
[1:20:12] in his and his and his flocks
[1:20:14] and so david sent some men to nabal and
[1:20:17] he said am i saying that right is that
[1:20:18] the right name i think it is yep um you
[1:20:21] know can you give us something to eat
[1:20:24] and abel just got mad who's this david
[1:20:26] what's this you know and just sent them
[1:20:28] away with nothing
[1:20:29] and david got real mad he basically said
[1:20:33] to most of his men he didn't um um i
[1:20:35] think 400 of his men and him arm
[1:20:37] yourselves we're going to deal with this
[1:20:38] guy
[1:20:39] but the bible says that
[1:20:41] abigail
[1:20:44] if i can find it here
[1:20:46] she was basically beautiful and of a
[1:20:48] good understanding
[1:20:51] i like it when when we can
[1:20:54] yeah she was a good understanding and of
[1:20:56] a beautiful countenance i like it when
[1:20:58] the lord tells us we're beautiful and
[1:21:00] we've got a good understanding because
[1:21:02] abigail here is a type of the bride you
[1:21:05] know there's some types in the scripture
[1:21:06] that are just us
[1:21:08] like ruth or rahab
[1:21:10] right or abigail here
[1:21:13] and so the lord is really showing us in
[1:21:15] the scripture this is what i think of
[1:21:16] you
[1:21:17] you have a good understanding because
[1:21:18] you've got my mind and you're a
[1:21:20] beautiful woman
[1:21:23] amen the lord doesn't hide us in the
[1:21:25] corner
[1:21:26] the law is not ashamed of us i if i have
[1:21:28] to start every service till you get it
[1:21:30] i'm going to say it the lord is proud of
[1:21:32] his achievement we are his greatest
[1:21:34] achievement amen we are his victory we
[1:21:37] are not his defeat we're not his
[1:21:38] embarrassment we are his victory he is
[1:21:41] proud
[1:21:42] of you and i
[1:21:44] god is in such a way that he lifts his
[1:21:45] bride up
[1:21:47] i believe
[1:21:48] i know we join ears but my feeling is he
[1:21:50] just lifts us up because remember we're
[1:21:52] jewels in his crown
[1:21:53] you see someone decked out in royal
[1:21:55] apparel like crowns and stuff you don't
[1:21:57] see the person you see their crown and
[1:21:59] their fancy stuff
[1:22:01] why because because they wear it in such
[1:22:03] a way that the attention does not go
[1:22:05] upon themselves but goes upon
[1:22:08] their crown
[1:22:09] their robes yes
[1:22:11] and the lord is showing that to us
[1:22:13] because he's he's saying actually i you
[1:22:16] are my greatest achievement
[1:22:18] i'm proud of you i'm not ashamed of you
[1:22:21] even in spite of our troubles ups and
[1:22:23] downs lefts and rights and
[1:22:25] you know personality peculiarity all
[1:22:28] those things we are jewels in his crown
[1:22:31] to reflect the light
[1:22:34] because god's proud of us
[1:22:36] i just i'd say lord thank you you're
[1:22:38] proud of i don't see the thing is i
[1:22:39] don't know how he's proud of me but if
[1:22:41] he says he he takes pleasure in his
[1:22:43] people and i'm one of them
[1:22:45] i say thank you lord
[1:22:47] hallelujah
[1:22:49] i pray that just because you know we get
[1:22:51] so scared
[1:22:52] will i be accepted that day well the
[1:22:55] bible tells us that he goes to prepare a
[1:22:57] place for us
[1:22:58] and if he does he'll come again and
[1:23:00] receive you unto himself that where he
[1:23:02] is you'll be also
[1:23:04] that's in john 14. so he says i'm going
[1:23:06] to go prepare a place for you
[1:23:08] and he's done that
[1:23:09] and he's going to come again and receive
[1:23:11] you to himself
[1:23:12] and he's doing that
[1:23:14] hello this is what this message is
[1:23:16] that's why christ and the believer
[1:23:18] becoming one what is that that is you
[1:23:20] being received
[1:23:22] amen because remember he gives you the
[1:23:24] holy ghost because he receives your
[1:23:26] faith
[1:23:28] right he receives your faith if he's
[1:23:30] received your faith in the blood then
[1:23:33] he's received you
[1:23:35] amen so if he's who's been
[1:23:38] hey is anyone in that condition
[1:23:42] right
[1:23:44] because many times brother ram says
[1:23:45] people misunderstand me sure we have to
[1:23:47] receive the lord
[1:23:49] as our lord and savior but he's got to
[1:23:50] receive us how does he do that he
[1:23:52] receives our faith
[1:23:54] which is just a common thing take him at
[1:23:56] his word believe in what he's done for
[1:23:57] you right so
[1:23:59] he says i'll come again and receive you
[1:24:01] unto myself and this is what this
[1:24:03] message does it's a receiving
[1:24:05] hallelujah hallelujah it's actually us
[1:24:08] receiving
[1:24:10] him receiving us
[1:24:12] hallelujah just like i said on wednesday
[1:24:14] i just think about maybe it's a turn of
[1:24:16] phrase but i was thinking about how you
[1:24:18] know people say are you prepared to meet
[1:24:20] the lord yes but he prepares me to meet
[1:24:23] him
[1:24:24] right because we are his workmanship i'm
[1:24:26] not my own workmanship this is not seven
[1:24:28] steps to becoming rapture ready in your
[1:24:30] own ability no this just repent and be
[1:24:32] baptized name the lord jesus christ
[1:24:34] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:24:35] the gift of the holy ghost that's how
[1:24:37] you become rapture ready
[1:24:39] hallelujah so it's actually us being
[1:24:41] prepared by him to meet him
[1:24:45] amen praise god praise the lord so she
[1:24:48] was of a good understanding and of a
[1:24:50] beautiful countenance now abigail
[1:24:52] because remember david was a man of war
[1:24:55] he was a type of christ but in him was a
[1:24:58] heart of mercy
[1:24:59] and that was really like the lord
[1:25:01] brother brahm said that you know it used
[1:25:02] to be that he thought that that that
[1:25:05] god was angry with him but then jesus
[1:25:07] loved him but he found out jesus is the
[1:25:09] heart of god
[1:25:10] right so so the heart of god is mercy
[1:25:14] really you know sure he's got judgment
[1:25:15] but in his core being he's mercy and
[1:25:18] deliverance and salvation that's really
[1:25:20] what because he's a life-giver
[1:25:22] right he wants to impart eternal life he
[1:25:25] wants to give life he doesn't want to
[1:25:27] destroy life because of judgment right
[1:25:29] so his core being is actually mercy and
[1:25:32] grace so now here's david on the outside
[1:25:34] we're just going to modi we're going to
[1:25:36] butcher these people
[1:25:37] but then abigail because she is of a
[1:25:39] good understanding
[1:25:41] and of a beautiful countenance speaking
[1:25:42] of you she went she it says that she
[1:25:45] baked 200 loaves of bread made all this
[1:25:47] food don't know how she did it but she
[1:25:49] did it you know and then so
[1:25:51] she went with these to david like
[1:25:53] prostrate herself down before him and
[1:25:56] and interceded for her husband
[1:25:59] and then so david his wrath was turned
[1:26:02] to mercy
[1:26:03] and we know god took care of nabal he
[1:26:05] was he died all these things but the
[1:26:07] thing is
[1:26:08] she brought out the best in david
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:13] what about you and i can we i pray not
[1:26:16] by our own humanity this is not by our
[1:26:18] five senses and even how we articulate a
[1:26:21] prayer it's not about a pretty prayer
[1:26:23] it's a half-out cry
[1:26:25] hallelujah and it's about can we i
[1:26:28] believe we can because we're being made
[1:26:30] thus
[1:26:30] to bring out the best in the lord
[1:26:34] hallelujah amen who wants the best out
[1:26:37] of him
[1:26:38] not just the surface there but but the
[1:26:40] depths of salvation
[1:26:42] to intercede like she did for her
[1:26:44] because remember if david walked in
[1:26:46] there he would have just killed everyone
[1:26:47] killed all the men he says i'm going to
[1:26:49] kill every man in this place
[1:26:51] but
[1:26:52] because abigail brought out the best in
[1:26:54] david
[1:26:55] amen they're all spared
[1:26:59] so can we be the same way i believe we
[1:27:01] can
[1:27:02] amen if we've been made new creatures in
[1:27:03] christ we can bring out the best in the
[1:27:05] lord
[1:27:06] hallelujah that that that eternal life
[1:27:08] is imparted that salvation comes
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:22] now
[1:27:24] brother bam says i'm going to i was
[1:27:25] going to read some
[1:27:27] read a few quotes and then we actually
[1:27:28] were going to finish maybe a a bite size
[1:27:30] portion today but i just i just wanna
[1:27:32] you know sometimes the mail will get as
[1:27:34] long
[1:27:35] sometimes it's very short but you just
[1:27:37] deliver the mail
[1:27:39] right because i want you to think is my
[1:27:40] life bringing out the best
[1:27:42] in the lord and is my life that i'm now
[1:27:45] living is it the love of god that causes
[1:27:48] me to not be burdened down by troubles
[1:27:51] in life but does it bring out the best
[1:27:52] like in jacob's life because of love it
[1:27:55] seemed all the problems he had for seven
[1:27:57] years it seemed about a few days
[1:28:00] you know because it brought it love
[1:28:02] caused christ to be expressed out of his
[1:28:04] life
[1:28:05] and is that the same thing with you and
[1:28:07] i and and i very much whenever i preach
[1:28:09] something i always put myself in it you
[1:28:11] know
[1:28:12] it's because of love that's why we
[1:28:13] should never because the bible says
[1:28:16] because the knickers shall abound the
[1:28:17] love of many shall wax coals
[1:28:21] we can't stop iniquity abounding
[1:28:24] but we can stop it we can stop it
[1:28:26] affecting us
[1:28:29] right that our love does not wax coal
[1:28:32] but it gets greater
[1:28:36] amen remember this is not an age of
[1:28:38] survival
[1:28:40] this is an age of overcoming
[1:28:42] right we are not here just going to
[1:28:44] scrape in
[1:28:45] we are going to overcome
[1:28:48] and the power of god is always greater
[1:28:51] than the power of the devil the devil
[1:28:53] comes and by deception and lies right
[1:28:56] that's how he gets you by deception and
[1:28:58] lies and he uses circumstances you're in
[1:29:01] he just wants you to agree with his take
[1:29:03] on those circumstances
[1:29:05] and if he you agree with him then he's
[1:29:07] got you
[1:29:09] like for example people just get in
[1:29:10] their minds they're you know they'll
[1:29:12] never be happy
[1:29:14] and that's the devil telling them
[1:29:15] they'll you'll never be happy and then
[1:29:17] they agree i'll never be happy then what
[1:29:18] happens they're never happy
[1:29:21] you know or you'll never you'll never
[1:29:23] earn enough money what happens and then
[1:29:25] they agree with that then they nothing
[1:29:26] is good enough
[1:29:27] there's like negative things that come
[1:29:29] and i know it may be very kind of vague
[1:29:30] but you know who knows what i'm talking
[1:29:32] about
[1:29:33] or you'll never have peace or you'll
[1:29:35] never overcome this
[1:29:36] that's what the devil says but his
[1:29:38] deception is you're stuck with it
[1:29:41] and if you agree with that then you're
[1:29:43] stuck with it but the lord is here to
[1:29:45] say you don't have to be stuck with
[1:29:47] nothing
[1:29:48] the only thing you should be stuck with
[1:29:49] is joy love peace faith long suffering
[1:29:52] temperance joy in the holy ghost power
[1:29:54] to overcome that's the only thing you
[1:29:56] should be stuck with if i can say it in
[1:29:57] such a crude way
[1:29:59] so we shouldn't listen to the devil's
[1:30:01] lies and deception what's another lie
[1:30:04] brings in we'll look at all the problems
[1:30:06] and everyone else
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:08] what happens and then our focus is on
[1:30:10] them and not on the lord
[1:30:12] and then we become in harmony with
[1:30:14] everyone else as problems and not in
[1:30:16] harmony with the holy ghost
[1:30:18] i want to stay in harmony with the holy
[1:30:20] ghost
[1:30:21] oh but that's just turning a blind eye
[1:30:23] no it's not it's by it's sticking to the
[1:30:26] one who can solve the problem
[1:30:28] just like david when his men wanted to
[1:30:30] stone him because ziglag was burned and
[1:30:31] all their families were taken away he he
[1:30:34] encouraged himself in the lord his god
[1:30:36] he went back to a source of strength god
[1:30:39] gave him the answer and he got
[1:30:41] everything back amen he his whole his
[1:30:43] family was restored their families were
[1:30:45] restored they lost nothing
[1:30:48] in a time of transition
[1:30:50] i mean from one kingship to another
[1:30:52] we're in a time of transition too from
[1:30:54] the church ages to a millennium there's
[1:30:56] a rapture in between but there's a time
[1:30:58] of trouble in between
[1:31:00] amen so so you've got to go back to your
[1:31:02] source of strength our source of
[1:31:04] strength should never be the lies of the
[1:31:05] devil saying there's no way out of this
[1:31:07] no god can make a way
[1:31:09] peter was in the inner prison going to
[1:31:11] get killed the next day god made a way
[1:31:13] there are all these guards just chained
[1:31:15] to many guards they went you know the
[1:31:16] angels came in and the chains came off
[1:31:18] how did he do it i don't know but he did
[1:31:20] it
[1:31:21] even knocked him on the side said get up
[1:31:23] put your robe on put your shoes on we're
[1:31:24] going for a walk
[1:31:26] hallelujah and it's all because people
[1:31:28] were praying because the people the
[1:31:30] believers did not accept that peter
[1:31:32] should die they interceded amen and
[1:31:34] that's what we should do we should go to
[1:31:36] our source of strength say oh and then
[1:31:38] what does that do that brings out the
[1:31:40] best in god you want to see him as a
[1:31:42] healer amen go to him in prayer you want
[1:31:45] to see him as a mighty god of
[1:31:46] deliverance amen go to a prayer
[1:31:48] intercede you'll see him as a mighty god
[1:31:50] of deliverance
[1:31:52] hallelujah
[1:31:54] but it takes love to do
[1:31:56] it he says in a hidden life in christ
[1:32:00] i wish i could explain it but let me
[1:32:02] tell you something brother you'll never
[1:32:03] come in contact with a greater force in
[1:32:05] this life than love
[1:32:07] yes sir i do not try to conquer demons
[1:32:09] by kicking them
[1:32:10] i love god
[1:32:13] see love is what god is god is love god
[1:32:16] love moves god
[1:32:19] god so love the world it's love love
[1:32:22] loves what conquers
[1:32:24] so he says he doesn't conquer demons by
[1:32:25] kicking them
[1:32:27] he says i love god
[1:32:29] that's how he causes the devils to move
[1:32:32] he loved the lord
[1:32:34] so it's not even about what the devil's
[1:32:35] doing it's about the love of god in his
[1:32:38] heart
[1:32:39] right is it so it's not about that you
[1:32:41] know how many people came through the
[1:32:43] prayer line people would be
[1:32:44] demon-possessed and straight jackets
[1:32:46] slithering it like snakes and different
[1:32:48] things and totally full of the devil
[1:32:50] he didn't he didn't kick the devil you
[1:32:52] know but you know he didn't print out yo
[1:32:54] tell him to get out and all this anger
[1:32:56] yo the prophet prayed such calm prayers
[1:32:58] yes when it came to dealing with spirits
[1:33:01] now
[1:33:02] not everyone is made that way we all
[1:33:04] express ourselves differently like
[1:33:06] people preach different way people sing
[1:33:07] different way but this but he is such a
[1:33:09] calm wasn't all theatrical
[1:33:12] this is how god made him but the reason
[1:33:14] but the thing is the devil had to move
[1:33:17] why because he says i love god
[1:33:20] that maybe i trust that's not too simple
[1:33:22] it just goes over our heads
[1:33:24] amen but he loved the lord so much that
[1:33:27] caused the demons to move
[1:33:29] he said in blind bartimaeus how many
[1:33:31] loves them with real divine love
[1:33:33] now how do you know that here's one
[1:33:36] witness
[1:33:37] because you love one and you have love
[1:33:39] one for the other that's right we know
[1:33:41] we have past and death under life and we
[1:33:43] love our brethren
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:48] you want to see real love you say i love
[1:33:50] the lord but you can't put up with one
[1:33:51] another that love is just imaginary but
[1:33:54] if you really love one another you would
[1:33:56] give the off your back you'd do
[1:33:58] anything for them you stand in the gap
[1:34:00] whatever real real love
[1:34:03] that that shows you love the lord jesus
[1:34:05] and real love overrides annoyance
[1:34:10] real love
[1:34:11] fake love does not we should be able to
[1:34:13] look past one another's mistakes
[1:34:15] you know easy
[1:34:17] jesus looked past my mistakes i would
[1:34:20] hate to this wall would need to be the
[1:34:23] be like 20 million imac screens and all
[1:34:25] my mistakes written on it that's how big
[1:34:27] you know but he looked past all of that
[1:34:30] hallelujah so if the lord could overlook
[1:34:33] me
[1:34:34] and save me can't we look beyond one
[1:34:37] another
[1:34:39] who wants to see a powerful church
[1:34:41] who wants to see god move in power
[1:34:44] that sin can't even walk in the door
[1:34:46] i mean that that sickness can't stay
[1:34:49] amen that unbelief can't stay that
[1:34:51] complexes can't stay that pain can't
[1:34:53] stay i mean it has to leave because the
[1:34:55] power of god is so strong in this place
[1:34:57] that's what i want to see i mean people
[1:34:59] just come in and give their lives
[1:35:01] hallelujah people really weep their way
[1:35:03] to calvary meet god that's what i want
[1:35:05] to see
[1:35:06] amen amen well how do you do it i love
[1:35:08] god
[1:35:10] amen now
[1:35:12] by this men will know you're my
[1:35:14] disciples
[1:35:16] when when you
[1:35:17] become a member of the church no no when
[1:35:19] you shout no no when you speak with
[1:35:21] tongues no no when you have a healing
[1:35:23] service preach the gospel no no when you
[1:35:25] love you have love one for the other
[1:35:28] friends he says here friends i'm not no
[1:35:31] little boy no more i've seen many a test
[1:35:34] but i've never seen nothing yet could
[1:35:37] override love
[1:35:39] it takes everything out of the way love
[1:35:42] conquers wild animal love conquers it's
[1:35:45] the most conquering force there is
[1:35:47] because it's god
[1:35:49] i'm talking about real
[1:35:51] love it's unwavering love not a human
[1:35:53] love that goes up and down
[1:35:56] hallelujah
[1:35:58] hallelujah
[1:35:59] now he says this here i'll just i just
[1:36:01] finished with this quote i alluded to it
[1:36:02] but i want to read it he said and you
[1:36:04] when you're filled with the
[1:36:06] when you're filled with the spirit
[1:36:07] here's one of the best signs i know
[1:36:09] because someone's asking about the
[1:36:11] evidence of the holy ghost you're so in
[1:36:13] love with christ and believe every word
[1:36:15] that he says to be the truth
[1:36:17] see that's the evidence that you have
[1:36:19] the holy spirit and your life's full of
[1:36:21] joy and oh my everything's different see
[1:36:24] than what it used to be that's the holy
[1:36:26] spirit now these gifts are in the holy
[1:36:28] spirit now if this congregation this
[1:36:30] morning
[1:36:31] it's just a snug nice snug church he
[1:36:34] says he says full you know the overflow
[1:36:36] rooms are filled up of course
[1:36:38] but not announcing we're going to answer
[1:36:40] these questions but these people have
[1:36:42] just come and noticed if every person
[1:36:44] here was in perfect harmony with the
[1:36:46] holy spirit every one of you was filled
[1:36:48] with the holy spirit and in harmony with
[1:36:50] the holy ghost these signs would just be
[1:36:53] multiplying among you all the time see
[1:36:55] it'll just be constantly going but where
[1:36:58] there's confusion
[1:36:59] where there's difference
[1:37:01] and where we set up the holy spirit
[1:37:04] can't move itself see it can't operate
[1:37:06] through the people
[1:37:09] so let's this morning i'm going to
[1:37:11] finish with this statement this this
[1:37:12] morning
[1:37:14] take away all the confusion
[1:37:15] how do we do that god's word's right
[1:37:18] god's word is always right above opinion
[1:37:21] above video blogs above what people pay
[1:37:24] paste on the internet whatever above all
[1:37:27] people's opinions god's word remains
[1:37:30] true
[1:37:31] and it meets the conditions of 2021 it
[1:37:34] will meet the conditions of 2022 and
[1:37:37] however long we're upon the earth the
[1:37:39] entire message meets end-time conditions
[1:37:42] the scripture meets in time conditions
[1:37:45] right amen so let's just take the
[1:37:47] confusion if if what you're feeding on
[1:37:49] look you got to look now who watched the
[1:37:52] this is years ago there was a
[1:37:53] documentary called supersize me
[1:37:56] whoever watched that the guy lived on
[1:37:58] mcdonald's for a month
[1:38:00] and he had certain effects in his body
[1:38:02] because he was just living on mcdonald's
[1:38:04] he put on weight was very lethargic
[1:38:06] couldn't concentrate so much it was you
[1:38:08] know it was bad for him every meal was
[1:38:10] mcdonald's
[1:38:12] now
[1:38:13] so the effect of the mcdonald's the
[1:38:14] effect of what he was eating caused him
[1:38:16] to be put on weight lethargic
[1:38:18] couldn't focus
[1:38:20] so you've got to look at what you're
[1:38:22] eating spiritually
[1:38:24] and look at the effects of it
[1:38:26] and and when you see the effects of it
[1:38:27] you actually say is this good or not so
[1:38:30] does it make you lethargic towards the
[1:38:32] lord
[1:38:33] does it fill your heart with fear and
[1:38:35] double-mindedness
[1:38:37] does it put doubt in the word
[1:38:40] the things you feed on think about and
[1:38:42] this could be the news this could be
[1:38:44] anything right movies music news
[1:38:47] whatever does it make you does it take
[1:38:49] the joy of the lord from your life
[1:38:52] if it does
[1:38:54] change your diet
[1:38:55] amen oh all things in moderation no no
[1:38:59] when it comes to the devil's stuff nah
[1:39:02] that's not in moderation i need to relax
[1:39:06] you just actually you really meet god
[1:39:08] you know i was telling the
[1:39:09] the sunday school i was
[1:39:12] i was telling them about how when my
[1:39:13] sister hannah was a nurse in saudi
[1:39:15] arabia
[1:39:17] they had on the screens in the hospital
[1:39:18] people walking around the you know the
[1:39:20] black rock thing there in mecca and that
[1:39:23] was on just all the time and people just
[1:39:24] sat there and watched it
[1:39:27] and she said that's so crazy
[1:39:30] and and i just thought to myself i
[1:39:31] should have responded it's like no it's
[1:39:33] the spirit on them is feeding on that
[1:39:35] and it's producing that
[1:39:37] right
[1:39:38] that's why they love it because the
[1:39:39] spirit in them is feeding on that and
[1:39:41] they can sit there and watch people do
[1:39:43] that for hours and you know and but the
[1:39:45] thing is it's the spirit in you
[1:39:47] will feed on certain things
[1:39:50] so if you've got the spirit of the world
[1:39:52] in you you're not going to love the
[1:39:54] spirit of god
[1:39:56] you won't but if you have the spirit of
[1:39:57] god in you
[1:39:59] you will get joint satisfaction from his
[1:40:01] word
[1:40:02] and from his songs from his music and
[1:40:05] you'll love it
[1:40:06] right so what spirit
[1:40:09] is in you and what's it feeding on
[1:40:11] i would change your diet
[1:40:13] if it if if what your if what's being
[1:40:16] produced in your life is fear worry
[1:40:18] stress double mindedness
[1:40:20] you know no stability in your christian
[1:40:22] walk i would change your diet
[1:40:25] because you see you know we have we have
[1:40:29] testimony
[1:40:31] of people who have decided to follow
[1:40:33] jesus
[1:40:34] living right here and they have and they
[1:40:37] were once like the super size me guy
[1:40:39] when it comes to things of the world but
[1:40:40] yet their diet was radically changed
[1:40:43] and they just begin to feed on the word
[1:40:47] and you can see the effects in their
[1:40:48] life
[1:40:49] sin is gone
[1:40:51] sure their life's there's still trouble
[1:40:53] in life because we're not exempt but
[1:40:54] there's overcoming joy
[1:40:56] there's joy there's a peace there's a
[1:40:58] stability amen that that wasn't there
[1:41:01] when they used to be chasing everything
[1:41:03] that was trending in the world and up
[1:41:05] and down and this is happening and oh
[1:41:07] dear this is happening and oh dear this
[1:41:09] is going on and you know that's all gone
[1:41:12] because the diet changed
[1:41:14] because we can say yes it's going on but
[1:41:16] praise the lord the word says when you
[1:41:18] see these things lift up your head you
[1:41:19] know your redemption is drawing nigh
[1:41:22] harlow you can see all these things
[1:41:23] going on you know you can just rejoice
[1:41:25] because we know we're actually we're in
[1:41:26] the end time
[1:41:29] amen
[1:41:31] where there's difference sorry i'm still
[1:41:32] here so get rid of the confusion see
[1:41:35] what is what you're feeding on what is
[1:41:37] it producing
[1:41:40] i pray that you're feeding on the right
[1:41:41] thing
[1:41:43] and it's producing the joy of the lord
[1:41:45] and a strength
[1:41:46] that when you're when your heart is
[1:41:48] overwhelmed you go to the rock you go to
[1:41:49] him that's higher than you
[1:41:51] amen
[1:41:52] now where there's difference difference
[1:41:55] is because of humanity
[1:41:57] we're all built differently
[1:41:59] now i'd you may be
[1:42:01] very disappointed in this next statement
[1:42:03] i will still be me in eternity
[1:42:07] so
[1:42:08] you know just just get yeah sure they'll
[1:42:10] be the negative side of me won't be
[1:42:12] there but my personality i'll still be
[1:42:14] me
[1:42:15] okay yeah well i wasn't expecting a big
[1:42:18] hallelujah right there
[1:42:20] but
[1:42:21] you know we've gotta just
[1:42:24] we'll still be us
[1:42:27] right so don't get caught up on
[1:42:30] differences of personality and things
[1:42:33] that causes
[1:42:35] that causes the lord not to move yes
[1:42:38] that's difference
[1:42:40] and where we set up what's the way we
[1:42:42] set up you get all systemized in your
[1:42:43] religion and your approach to god
[1:42:45] well this is how we do things because
[1:42:47] this no no hold on is god moving amen is
[1:42:50] god moving that's what we want is god
[1:42:51] moving
[1:42:52] is god changing lives is god making us
[1:42:54] more like him that's the setup we want
[1:42:58] amen so
[1:43:00] i'm just going to finish there
[1:43:02] but i pray
[1:43:03] like jacob when he fell in love with
[1:43:06] rachel those seven years about for a few
[1:43:08] days for the love he had
[1:43:11] to her
[1:43:12] amen so i pray it's the same thing with
[1:43:14] all of us all these things that go on in
[1:43:16] life no the love we have
[1:43:19] for the lord
[1:43:20] has expressed the love we have for one
[1:43:22] another and to our families to this lost
[1:43:25] and dying world
[1:43:27] and all the troubles we go through
[1:43:29] it's it's just a nothing
[1:43:31] you know brother brown makes a statement
[1:43:33] these things will seem so small when we
[1:43:35] get to the end of the
[1:43:36] way you know when we've been there then
[1:43:39] when we've been there one second
[1:43:42] and you know the thing is
[1:43:44] when the lord comes down
[1:43:46] and you just feel such a love
[1:43:49] and you just want to be it all the time
[1:43:51] do you think that when you see him face
[1:43:53] to face he's going to turn you away
[1:43:56] if he's received you this side he can't
[1:43:58] turn you away that side
[1:44:00] right
[1:44:02] amen let's have the musicians please
[1:44:03] this morning
