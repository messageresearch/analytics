so praise God Amen let's just um before we go into the communion foot washing I just want to speak a little bit from um I'm going to go to Mark chap uh chapter 7: 36 and 37 amen it's great to have everyone here tonight amen sure enjoyed the Sunday School place praise the Lord thank you so much all the specials and amen praise God that was wonderful really enjoyed all those so praise the Lord amen so the Lord amen if I look at you funny it's cuz I pulled a neck a muscle on my neck you know so anyway yep so I'm not looking at you funny it's just hey age or something I think someone told me you know any who Mark 7:36 and 37 we'll read this oh yeah I can do this can't I amen and he and he charged them this is this is uh the Lord Jesus charg them they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much more a great so much the more a great deal they published it and we're beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the de to hear and the dumb to speak so I just want to take that phrase he hath done all things well amen and I can put it as a question has he not done all things well has he not done what he promised he would do but you see the pro and we put ourselves in the picture and get frustrated at God doing things well that's where a problem can come so let's just Bowe in a word of prayer tonight you want to be remembered in prayer you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen gracious father we want to thank you so much Lord that we are your children by Your Grace we're no longer slaves to fear we're no longer slaves to unbelief we're no longer slaves to sin but we are your love prisoners Lord God we are your children we're so thankful we can be gathered on this night Lord and I pray father read your word may you the great author step forth and Speak Lord Jesus may you have the preeminence for this final moment of the Year dear God as we come here to worship and thank you for all you have done because you have done all things well Lord you've done great things Lord this year in our lives and we thank you Father for every testimony you've given us dear God we pray you'll just take the service Under Your Divine control may be with those who couldn't make it tonight because of sickness dear God father there's many who are away because of that Lord I pray you'd be their portion tonight tonight we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight I just want to ask you that question I'm going to ask it a lot has he not done all things well it's so important that we don't inject our own thoughts into what God has prophesied to do because when we when we inject our own selves that's when unbelief can step in and take over and God has done so many things we must be very careful to stick with all that God has promised to do now it's very interesting when you look at we're just going to go through the um uh just a few examples here but you know there's one one particular one you know it's amazing how when God will speak something and if we interpret it differently to our God will interpret it people will get frustrated they'll get annoyed at God unbelief will rise and they'll just spit the dummy out they'll throw the toys out of the cck but God's right on schedule but if we put our own thoughts into it that's when God's whole everything he's done can be just be brought to almost nothing because we have put ourselves eles in the picture so I just want to ask you the question has he not done all things well and will he not continue to do all things well because just as the devil's the creature of habit so is our God a creature of habit where he does all things well he he's done all things well from the beginning he does all things well today he'll do all things well in 2024 he's going to keep doing all things well now we're reading here just from Luke just going to you want to read with me he says so so this is where Zechariah he's standing in the temple the angel Gabriel comes and speaks to him and and and and he's here to announce that the uh you that uh John is going to be uh his son he's going to be the Forerunner all these things that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou Hast been instructed this is Luke now speaking here here was in the days of Herod the king of Judah a certain priest named Zacharias of the course of uh ABIA and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and they were both righteous before God walking all the Commandments and ordinance of the Lord blameless and they they had no children because Elizabeth was Barren and they were um and they both were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before God in uh in the order of his course according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zachariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John how long have they been praying for a child now they had come to a stage of life where they thought it's impossible but it's amazing how when we pray for things God will answer in his time according to his season not our schedule God doesn't work by our program as brother am would say at the closing of a new year I mean end of a year he'd say may we see Jesus and his program it's so important we see Jesus and his program because it's one thing just to see the Lord but you got to see him and his program because if you see his program he can line up with his program which is his word and it doesn't matter what happens you won't be offended amen right so he heard so so the Lord had heard his prayers but no doubt Zacharias and and Elizabeth thought well I guess God did not is not going to answer our prayer let's not put a full stop on what we think God's going to do now amen God can do the exceedingly abundantly more than we ask or can think right amen let's not put God in a box am mean I pray 2024 is a God we serve a god that is not in a box in our own lives he won't be bound he's moved through church ages moved through movements all these things as soon as man puts God in a box he moves on let's not be those kind of a people amen let's let God be God and let us be us and let God be God right and do what he wants to do so amen and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither strong uh neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and Zachariah said un to the angel whereby shall I know this for I'm an old man and my wife well stricken in years amen now I didn't put verse 19 in here for some reason um but hey we can just find that here where are we oh maybe we're in Luke come in Mark let's just let's just let's just get this here cuz I don't know why I missed it but hey so we're in Luke chapter 1 and we are verse 19 no we're not trust you don't mind the technical technical difficulty this uh this evening now and the angel answered said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and and sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these Glad Tidings amen all right so this is who's speaking to them not just anyone else right and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in this season now I want you to just there's quite a few things in here I'm going to you I made a to them but one of them is that the a the words of the Angel shall be fulfilled in their season not in your season not in my season yeah in God's season right so the the words of the seventh angel will be performed in their season amen okay and behold yes and the and the people waited for Zacharias and Marvel that he carried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he Beacon under to them and remained speechless and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days dur and he looked on me to take away my reproach among men now we're just going to jump down in the story where where the same Angel Gabriel speaks to Mary and with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her and Mary arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with haste into a city of Judea and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary The Babe leapt in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost now Elizabeth's fulltime came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son now we're going to con and her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her now we're going to jump back to this but but here's a question there's quite a few things that the angel said would be fulfilled now as soon as the angel said it now here comes the time scale number one you know if I find my if I find my list here this is not an order but Zacharias was promised numerous things as part of the same promise he wouldn't be able to speak that happened straight away uh until a son be born so that's the end of the of the whole thing before his son is born uh his son will receive the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb that puts a time scale on things okay so now his son is going to be the Forerunner of the Messiah his name is going to be called John and he'll be able to speak again so all of these promises are from the same Angel giving all these promises now what would happen if John put his interpretation into this list and said well as soon as John is born or you know zachari put his interpretation on this list well as soon as John is born I'm going to be able to speak again oh boy he would stay in unbelief and stay dumb because it wasn't see if he had that in his mind well as soon as his son is born my tongue's going to be loosed I'm going to praise God but you see that was his season that was his thinking it wasn't God's thinking see what happens is God can fulfill so many promises Elizabeth was with child there one prom well first one he couldn't speak that's one promise number two he Elizabeth was was with child that's the second promise third promise is John received the ghost in his mother's womb that's the third promise fourth promise is he's born right say all these promises that God has given but what if John spat the dummy just using uh you know that kind of term and got angry and frustrated at God if when he was soon as was born he couldn't speak see and this is what people do has God not done all things well and they begin to doubt what God is about to do in their lives and if you let unbelief take you over that thing will not happen yeah but has has not God done all things well amen has he not called you from a life of sin has he not brought you out of Darkness has he not saved you has he not washed you has he not filled you with the Holy Ghost has he not baptized you amen has he not walked with you has he not guided you has he not kept you from falling has he not kept you from many dangerous toils and snares even this last year God has kept us from many dangers this world is in a Free Fall Into Darkness why aren't you going with it cuz God unfailing hand says I'm not going to let these ones fall I'm going to hold them and sustain them and keep them amen from falling thank you Lord has he not done these things oh yes then why do we doubt him with everything else he's promised why do he say he cannot do it he's done all these things see people think well my problem is too hard no one understands R I've Bean it's impossible Jesus went to hell with one scripture he knew is going to come out of the grave and that scripture was I'll not I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption will not leave his soul in Hell by that one Revelation he had in his heart he knew that he was going to die but he was going to come back to life again amen he went to the worst place in existence for you and you think you've got a problem he carried your sin my sin all of our sin all the sin of the world up Calvary he died he's forsaken he says my God my God why is Thou forsaken me amen when he was in Gethsemane sweating it out it was Drops of blood falling cuz he was in Ang cuz he knew exactly what he was going through he saw it by Vision he knew he's going to be beaten he's going to be M more than any other man he's going to his his bones are going to be out of joint all these things are going to happen to him and he stepped into it gladly for you and you think you have a bad day and you think you've got trouble and you know we're going to put things in perspective Jesus went with faith into that and came out the other side Glory Paul said the life are I live I live by the faith of the Son of God so if Jesus could walk into hell with that faith can we not walk through Satan's Eden with that same faith and go to a Rapture can we not if his faith overcame hell death in the grave and all the hordes of hell don't you think that faith and you can operate the same way and do the same things and overcome the same problems I believe it can that's why we're standing today I may be shouting but I'm very happy because I look back at a year I say that wasn't all the failes was me but all the victory was God Amen all the overcoming was not me it was him and the reason we're still Believers today is not because of us and what we think we are it's who he is is the reason we're Believers today the reason we're overcoming today still have faith in this word is because of him not ourselves amen so I think you know we should never ever inject our own thoughts and say well God can't do it that's right God's going to take a people off the Earth they're going to be old they're going to be young they're going to be teenage going to be young people they're going to be elderly they're going to be all different ages he's going to transform their bodies amen amen I believe it amen is there anything too hard for the Lord no but people say well you don't understand and I just need no we need God we need God and one another we need to gather more together we need to see the fire of God move we need to put our problems you know I've been to places and I hear people just talk about their complexes all the time and but they believer but they talk about their complex and I think well what are they worshiping in this place are they worshiping their humanity and their complexes and their problems or they worshiping God I think we should make our problems very small and make our God very big am mean we should make him the biggest cuz he is the biggest my daddy's bigger than all the daddies Hallelujah he can beat up all the daddies I mean he already beat them up when he conquered hell death in the grave you know what I mean so we should never exalt our problems amen because if we exalt our problem problems will get offended come on now that's true you know Jesus would say you blind guide you strain at a net and swallow a camel and that strain means to filter out you filter out the smallest thing you think is wrong and this is what happens people get a blindness on them and they and they and they strain out a little thing that they're not happy with a little net but yet they'll swallow up this world they'll gulp it down by the by the screen load or by the airwave load you know they'll gulp it down but they'll strain out this little thing that they the things we don't like is cuz we're not willing to die we're not willing to surrender that's the things people strain out they're not willing to allow those things to like Brother Andy says if the flesh Burns let it burn if you feel uncomfortable let it burn let God burn it out of you amen I think that's a good way to look at things amen so so we don't want to get into this place CU what happens is when you strain at the small things you get offended Jesus spoke a lot about getting offended he said blessed is he whom is not offended in me or I can put it a different way blessed is he who's not offended in how I fulfill my word in your life amen see it's very easy say yes we're going in a Rapture yes this is all these things happening what happens when it comes down to your life my life Wow blessed is he who opens the cupboard and is not offended that it's empty blessed is he that looks at the bank account and doesn't get offended cuz it's just a bunch of zeros and maybe a negative in front of it I don't know yeah blessed is he when he Praises something and it goes sideways and he doesn't get mad he Praises God anyhow we should never be offended yes sir with how God how God fulfills his word he's in the business of fulfilling his word we're in the business of surrendering to his will that his word is fulfilled amen abolutely he said this in Matthew 11 I don't have the whole thing up there but he said this to John's disciples John was in prison he was getting offended all right because he' introduced the Messiah he had the story of his parents of his peculiar birth and everything that happened there and he knew he is different because and and and and the reason he knew he is different because his mother said when when when Mary who was carrying the Messiah came my way and spoke Jesus is name to me you got filled with the Holy Ghost that's your testimony he thought this is why God's with me but then when he fulfilled his mission on Earth and he was in a prison yeah he got offended because he didn't think it would have ended up that way Lord hallelujah he got offended we shouldn't get offended how God fulfills his word I have no idea what 24 is going to bring us we could be gone who knows the world could collapse yes whatever happens praise God can we actually have the faith and trust in God to say Lord whatever you want for my life whatever happens if sickness strikes my family if trouble strikes my family if hardship strikes my family I walk with with you in it Lord I'll walk with you in the trouble I'll walk with you in the sickness Lord are we willing I pray we are I believe I'm looking at a people prise the Lord he said I want to go dancing out of this place we we might dance later but if you're if you're blessed if you're not offended in how God fulfill his word you're very blessed because even look at this this is the disciples Jesus here before they go to the Garden of Gethsemane this Matthew 26 here then saith Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written you're going to be offended because this scripture is going to be fulfilled in you I will Smite the sheeper and the and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I'll go before you into Galilee he told them he was going to be crucified he told them he was going to raise the third day he told this to them numerous times but in the Fulfillment there was an offense for them and Peter said I'm never going to be offended you can't offend me Lord doesn't matter what you send me through I'm just going to coaster it cuz I'm just made of this kind of stuff he realized his Humanity wasn't built come on to to not be offended in the word being fulfilled right but when you get the Holy Ghost is a different story amen amen now this word offended it's actually uh a scandal this is the root word it's a scandal it's a a trap stick which is bent like a bent sapling it's a snare figuratively a cause of displeasure or sin sometimes how the words fulfill can actually displease us that's right I'll say amen for everyone sometimes we're like Lord why is my life going this way and it's the perfect will of God it's exactly where he wants you to go and you're thinking Lord do I have to yes if we had our way let's let's just be real honest if we had our way would you have wanted any of the trials you have had even this last year but we want God's way amen us we don't want our way Satan wants his way to be Antichrist is to want your own way so let's not be Antichrist it's an occasion to fall of stumbling it's an offense it's a thing that offends a stumbling block and how we can sadly see when the word is fulfilled it can stumble it can offend Believers amen we don't want to be like that brother says in the forgotten beatitude I won't be too much longer oh my and blessed is he who's not offended in me now don't be offended I believe that there's more people offended in Jesus than any other person that ever lived on earth they get offended too quick Jesus now in this misplaced beatitude slipped over here so we could get it tonight why he said blessed is he who's not offended in me don't be offended then the more that takes place everything's working right on schedule yes so you just go ahead and believe it that's all everything's all right just go ahead and believe it I like that everything's right on schedule it's right on budget everything's performing Just Right In God's economy we just got to go in and believe his word not to get offended amen see it's the Fulfillment we get offended and the Israelites when they came out of Egypt they at the Red Sea and they're asking Moses because there's no graves in Egypt h has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness they have they became offended because their enemy was behind them the Red Sea was in front of them and they were going to see they were about to see the greatest hand of Deliverance that God had ever done they weren't offended at the 10 plagues or how many plagues there were in Egypt right but it was this time they begin to get offended it's because God was wanting to take them on a faith walk all the word brought them out but they had to have faith mix that word with faith now and start walking with the Lord but those those that God offended thought well you've just brought us out here to die but you see they forgot to remember what God had promised them to do he says I come down this is verse eight this is the Lord speaking to Moses I've come them to deliver them out there's no offense in that the 10 plagues will have many out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey so the people who got offended did not believe that God his whole promise he had brought them out they weren't in Egypt anymore they weren't in Goan anymore they were standing on the bank of the Red Sea they were there but then they got offended because they thought now we're just going to get massacred they misunderstood how God wanted to deliver them we don't want to misunderstand you know brother Braham says that that Saul before he became Paul how he persecuted the church was a man under conviction yeah after stoning you know consenting to see Stephen stoned all these things it was a man under conviction and we see God actually trouble begins to stir it at home it's actually God bringing someone under conviction and we get upset thinking Lord I'm praying for this but you're giving me this what do we do we get offended at God is actually answering prayer you may agree with me but this is what it is brother R said a man under conviction is like Saul before he met the Lord on the road to Damascus so you see someone in a family start acting up in Pride and selfishness and trouble and me me me and all these kind of things it's someone under conviction and instead of praising God come on thank you Jesus Glory you know you just had the worst meal of the dinner table ever someone just blew up and if they could they would have flipped the table in your face what do we do oh poor is me oh no God's not here he's not answering my prayers the devil's on the rampage this problem so big and God's actually got someone under conviction you got to allow them to stand under conviction someone some of you are looking at me real funny but you got to look at things differently yeah oh yeah instead of saying hallelujah thank you Lord you're dealing in my family sure that was a terrible time I'd never want to be in the atmosphere again because you all that trouble that got but actually we' say thank you Lord like if they just knew that their task Masters that were behind them were going to be drowned and they were going to do a victory dance on the other side of the Red Sea they wouldn't have been complaining yeah they wouldn't have been saying this they would say Moses glory amen you see that guy in that Chariot he beat me a lot he's going to drown in there I'm walking through there he's going to drown in there Hallelujah Miriam have you got your dancing shoes on have you got your tambourine ready Miriam Hallelujah because tomorrow we're dancing tomorrow they're dead but tomorrow we're dancing amen hallelujah but what do we do we do like this oh it can't work the promise isn't for me God's forsaken me the problem's too big the problem's too hard I can't get through this I just need me time God doesn't work God always works amen those people's attitudes and what is it it's unbeliev speaking Yeah the world has a lot of sin preaching and unbelief speaking sin is unbelief why don't we speak some Faith amen why don't we speak some Faith around the dinner table speak some Faith around in our conversations amen Caleb and Joshua said let's go take the mountain amen why because they believe that God would do the whole promise if he did the first part he's going to do the second part he doesn't do one part and say oh yeah that was fun I'll go to do something else no he fulfills his whole word but do we have faith that God can do his whole word amen yes amen so we don't want to be offended when trouble strikes all we don't want to be offended but you see now it was eight days the child was born for eight days but Zacharias said if God basically said in his heart God you done all these things my I can't speak my wife is pregnant my our son received the Holy Ghost in her womb all these things have happened you're going to loose my tongue in the right time I know I said it before but what if he said as soon as the baby's born well I'm dumb and I God said you know I'd speak but I can't speak he's wrong what's the point of serving this God yes we can't have that attitude it was 8 Days 8 days after the child was born but you see zacharias's confession had to match what the angel what the word said that's why as soon as he he was given the writing tablet because they said let's call him his name should be Zacharias and Elizabeth said no his name should be called John they saying but none of your family's name that way and but then they made signs to his father and and you know called him he took up the writing tablet and he inscribed in Hebrew his name is John what his confession matched what the angel said and as soon as his confession matched the word amen the miraculous took place in his life amen and that's what we've got to have when our confession matches what the what God has promised us in this day of Shamar manifested in our homes amen of the devil being kicked out restoration of Life sickness being driven out demon powers being cast out the Holy Ghost being poured out amen when we confess what the angel has said then the miraculous miraculous will take place amen who wants that who wants that this year amen that that that may our confession be the word hallelujah then what happened and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and he praised God it was more than just a mental thing his name was John it was from it was a revelation why cuz he no doubt he took stock I was made an angel met me and Angels met you God met you amen if you're a real believer God met you a church didn't meet you a religion didn't meet you Jesus Christ met you he stepped out of history and met you and then be to make some promises amen come unto me all you that are heavy labor your heavy laden I'll bring give you rest who's received that rest who's been transformed by the power of the Holy Ghost then will he not do everything else he said can he has he not done all things well and will he not continue to do all things well amen I pray is if if we're here another year we'll stand here and we'll give testimony said Lord you did all things well Lord you taught me this year not to inject my own thoughts into your word you taught me not to put myself in your word ahead of what you want to do but you told me to walk in harmony with the Fulfillment of your word and you fulfilled exactly what you promised to do Hallelujah that's right I pray that will be our testimony amen amen and I believe that we are a people that will see that amen God's built us that way by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I'm just going to close with the scripture here cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward don't throw your confidence away in God God is more than able am to do anything for ye have need of patience this world is an impatient world but we have need of patience what is the patience in the Statue of the perfect man patience with God many times we think it's just human patience with one another no it's patience with God they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with the wings as an eagle they shall walk and not be we run and run and not be weary walk and not faint amen after ye have done the will of God you might receive the promise praise the Lord amen amen amen I pray I pray this is us don't throw your confidence away yes the devil say he can't do it just turn the devil's lie around and say no he's he's more than able to do it amen let's have the musicians tonight shall we uh let's just sing a song hallu Amen and and but yeah I pray I pray we will just keep walking with the Lord and don't throw your confidence away if God is God will do he he does all things well amen amen so let's stand this is this is before we go into the communion service and maybe after we sing this brother Matt or now you can maybe maybe just um cut the stream whatever you want to do uh but let's stand and uh yeah yeah we'll use that table won't we amen um but before we just
