[29:39] name amen amen God bless you friends you
[29:42] can you can have your seats tonight so I
[29:44] just want to take a bit of a uh a bit of
[29:47] a uh um subject about you know you got
[29:49] to know the right season that you're
[29:50] alive in and um you know we we live in
[29:54] the most tremendous time that there ever
[29:55] has been in the history of man because
[29:58] there's a people upon the Earth that
[29:59] that that walk with God and shall we not
[30:01] cuz God's going to take them I mean so
[30:03] the same God that that called you that
[30:05] saved you that redeemed you that shed
[30:07] his blood for you is walking with you
[30:08] and he's going to take you one day so
[30:10] it's a glorious time to be alive amen
[30:12] now but it's amazing that you know God
[30:15] is you know um you look through the
[30:17] Bible it's whenever Trouble Comes God
[30:19] comes on the scene it's incredible where
[30:21] God would you know it's amazing when you
[30:23] know like the three Hebrew children in
[30:25] the fiery furnace that we've you know
[30:27] many of us have looked into it was the
[30:29] Fourth Man stepped into the fire when
[30:30] they were in the fire wasn't when they
[30:32] were Outside the Fire wasn't when they
[30:33] were in Jerusalem Before They carried
[30:35] away but God proved himself to them in
[30:38] the fire you you take you know you take
[30:41] Moses and his troubles and Joshua and
[30:43] all different ones down through the
[30:44] Bible take Jesus when he he would prove
[30:46] his great Supreme Being the Supreme
[30:48] deity raising the dead Healing The Sick
[30:50] doing all these things it's when trouble
[30:52] came into life and and and that's what
[30:55] God wants to show us is he wants to take
[30:56] us from from from leaning on the five
[30:59] senses of Faith uh sorry not Faith see
[31:03] taste smell hear you all those things he
[31:05] wants to take those things that we don't
[31:07] lean on those things anymore we don't
[31:08] lean on our imagination our reason our
[31:10] conscious our affections our our memory
[31:12] all those things but we lean on faith
[31:14] alone that's why God wants to prove
[31:16] himself in times of trouble and he does
[31:18] prove himself there you see our God
[31:20] loves to keep his word brother Braham
[31:22] says in Christ is he identified the same
[31:24] in all generations he said but he did it
[31:27] that it might be f fulfilled he has to
[31:28] keep his word and he loves to do it and
[31:30] he will do it because he's God and I
[31:33] pray tonight that he'll keep this word
[31:35] also that's promised for this hour amen
[31:37] and yeah I believe he he will keep his
[31:39] word promised for this hour it's
[31:41] impossible for him not to keep it
[31:42] because he's kept his word down through
[31:44] every generation now he loves to prove
[31:47] his word yes our God loves to prove
[31:50] himself amen he never backs up from a
[31:51] battle he never backs up from a trial he
[31:53] never says no I I'm tagging out you tag
[31:56] in and tell me how it goes no he loves
[31:58] to prove himself in the face of the
[32:00] devil amen he loves to prove himself in
[32:02] times of trouble amen and so you know he
[32:05] loves to prove I'm just going to read a
[32:07] couple of quotes here and proving his
[32:08] word he says what would he do he was
[32:10] proving his word proving his position
[32:13] proving that he was God was in Christ
[32:17] reconciling the world to himself and God
[32:19] is the word am mean he calmed this the
[32:22] wind and the waves to prove Isaiah's
[32:24] prophecy he shall be called The Mighty
[32:27] God the Everlasting father see he also M
[32:30] multiplied the bread and Fishes this
[32:32] virgin born son what was it to prove the
[32:34] word all scripture has to be fulfilled
[32:36] he proved the word by saying he was
[32:38] Jehovah made manifest he was the
[32:40] beginning of the creation of
[32:44] God beginning of the creation of God God
[32:47] in creation God made a little part of
[32:49] the creation here that God was living in
[32:51] himself he was the beginning of that
[32:53] creation of God for he for for him begat
[32:56] many sons not he also multiplied the
[32:58] fishes he is the word and the proof of
[33:01] the word now we know that we are his
[33:03] children we're made of the same
[33:06] material we're not made of different
[33:08] material now I'm not talking about your
[33:09] flesh not talking about your mind how
[33:11] smart you are talking about that Gene
[33:13] seed of God placed God placed in you
[33:15] that Soul amen the ability to take God
[33:17] at his word and believe it amen because
[33:19] as God believed his own word and it came
[33:21] into pass so he put something within us
[33:23] to believe his word that he would
[33:25] fulfill it in our lives and that's an
[33:27] incredible thing am mean in this age of
[33:29] skepticism and and and factchecking and
[33:31] all these things on the internet of
[33:32] false news and fake news and and you
[33:35] know deep fakes and fake voices fake
[33:37] video all these things there's a people
[33:39] on the Earth that can take God at his
[33:41] word amen amen and so I believe I'm
[33:43] looking at those people tonight amen
[33:45] that you know in spite of trouble
[33:47] circumstances what's going on we can
[33:49] believe his word yes sir and we hold on
[33:51] to it above all things now as I said in
[33:54] the beginning I want to talk about
[33:56] knowing you know it's essential to know
[33:58] the right season now we're living in the
[34:00] season of The Rapture this is not news
[34:02] to any one of us but you know I just
[34:04] pray that we'll just be encouraged
[34:05] tonight amen because we're living in the
[34:07] age of the Resurrection we're living in
[34:08] the time of the Resurrection this is
[34:10] Resurrection season now you can know the
[34:12] natural you know Seasons By really what
[34:15] it boils down to is the amount of
[34:17] sunshine because the amount of sunshine
[34:19] that's that's that that's that that's
[34:21] upon any place of the earth will will
[34:24] produce an atmosphere right so we know
[34:26] summer because there long days lots of
[34:28] sunshine we know winter because it's
[34:31] short days and where' the sun go cuz
[34:33] it's winter time you take you know like
[34:35] even like Alaska places where there's
[34:36] very short growing seasons for most of
[34:39] the Year short days not much Sunshine
[34:42] everything's covered in snow you know
[34:44] it's doesn't look like much is going on
[34:45] but there's seeds under the ground but
[34:48] then now when when when when spring
[34:49] comes and the days get very long they
[34:52] may have a short growing season but it's
[34:53] very powerful growing season why CU
[34:55] summer the sunshine is is is pouring out
[34:58] in its strength to bring forth what's in
[35:00] the seed and it's the same thing today
[35:02] you know friends we're not living in a
[35:04] winter spiritually you know you may feel
[35:07] like you're going through a winter but
[35:08] but we're not in a winter time am mean
[35:10] we're living in a summertime we're
[35:11] living in a Harvest Time am mean we're
[35:13] living in the time when there is much
[35:15] light am mean this is not a short you
[35:18] know a short daytime a lot of night time
[35:20] no we're living in the time when the
[35:22] sunlight of God is shining in his
[35:24] strength what is that to to bring forth
[35:26] you and I into the image of God Amen now
[35:31] see it's the but you see whenever
[35:34] there's a harvest time you know there's
[35:35] a lot of sunshine in a harvest time and
[35:38] it's amazing how many victories how many
[35:40] battles how many troubles happened
[35:42] during a harvest time so for example
[35:45] Joshua crossed the Jordan River went
[35:47] into the promised land uh during the
[35:50] time of harvest because it says in
[35:52] Joshua 3:15 says and as they bear the
[35:54] ark that came unto Jordan the feet of
[35:56] the priest that bear the ark were dipped
[35:58] into the brim of the water for Jordan
[36:00] overfloweth all his Banks all the time
[36:03] of harvest so they came into their
[36:04] inheritance in Harvest time they had a
[36:07] lot of battles but they were coming into
[36:09] the promise amen just like we are coming
[36:10] into every Divine promise of God what we
[36:13] are living in a harvest we are the
[36:14] Harvest amen we are the Harvest am mean
[36:17] we are God God's Harvest amen and same
[36:19] thing with Gideon Gideon was threshing
[36:21] Wheat by The Wine Press why was he doing
[36:23] that he was you thresh wheat during a
[36:26] harvest season and that's when God you
[36:28] know the angel of the Lord came down and
[36:29] and and said go on thy might thy Mighty
[36:32] Man of Valor here's a man hiding afraid
[36:34] hiding from his enemies all these things
[36:36] but God looked at him and said you're
[36:37] not a coward Gideon you're a mighty man
[36:39] of Val as the same thing with you and I
[36:41] friends we're not cowards amen amen no
[36:44] no we're mighty men and women of Valor
[36:45] amen who take God at his word she was
[36:47] threshing wheat during a harvest season
[36:49] but there's a great battle Ruth came
[36:51] into the promised land in the beginning
[36:53] of the barley Harvest I means all these
[36:56] things would happen during a harvest
[36:57] time now even even shamgar we need um
[37:00] slay 600 Philistines we know the Bible
[37:03] doesn't say it but brother Bram would
[37:04] dramatize it it's after shamgar got his
[37:07] harvest in then the 600 Philistines came
[37:09] to take the Harvest away so shamgar had
[37:12] a mighty victory in Harvest time he
[37:14] realized who he was in Harvest time I
[37:17] mean brother said that you know he
[37:19] already was a circumcised son of Abraham
[37:21] living in his inheritance nothing
[37:24] changed he only realized who he was so
[37:26] his attitude towards what God had made
[37:28] him changed amen and I believe that's
[37:30] the same thing with you and I when we
[37:31] can really see we're Sons and Daughters
[37:33] of the most high God God has made us
[37:35] thus we have not made ourselves this way
[37:37] I mean I believe we'll walk different
[37:39] act different talk different we'll we'll
[37:41] talk Victory I mean our language will be
[37:43] Victory Amen in spite of trouble what's
[37:45] going on we'll talk Victory yes sir amen
[37:48] not a negative confession a positive
[37:50] confession sure the You Know The Enemy
[37:53] may may be swallowing up the land but
[37:55] God is with us amen and if God is for
[37:57] who can be against us that's right amen
[37:59] but you see now during these times like
[38:01] brother BR would speak I know they speak
[38:03] about Harvest but you know the the the
[38:05] evolution of of of of
[38:09] Technology brother Braham says show
[38:11] something in the spiritual because I
[38:13] want to tell you who you are tonight
[38:14] you're an astronaut you're God's
[38:16] spiritual astronaut amen where you can
[38:19] live in a sphere of faith of only belief
[38:23] amen this is who you are amen so so he
[38:26] said you know there was there was there
[38:27] was an evolution of Transport where
[38:29] where it was once the horse and buggy
[38:31] and you know horses and that was for a
[38:32] very long time but then there came the
[38:34] automobile And Then There came the
[38:36] airplane and then now we're in space and
[38:39] he says it was the same thing you know
[38:41] with with under Luther it was the horse
[38:42] and Buggies that was you know one horse
[38:44] is one horsepower we know that ain't so
[38:46] if you had two horses you had two
[38:48] horsepower you had twice as much power
[38:50] but then but then then there came Wesley
[38:53] you know it was it it was more than a
[38:55] horse and buggy era it was you could say
[38:57] an as an evolution showing in technology
[38:59] is now the motorc car age and you know
[39:01] the fastest well this is the fastest
[39:03] electric car sorry I know it's not a
[39:05] real car but hey it's still a it's got
[39:07] four wheels amen it's the taian turbo GT
[39:10] I think it's a Porsche it has
[39:13] 1,93 horsepower that's a lot faster than
[39:16] one hor or two horsepower 1,093 and you
[39:19] think man I can drive pretty good with a
[39:21] over 1,000 horsepower But Then There
[39:23] came the restoration of the gifts where
[39:25] brother BR said men got off the ground
[39:26] they were flying around like like the
[39:28] right brothers or the brother who was
[39:30] down in you the man who was down in what
[39:32] South Island flew over hedge apparently
[39:34] the first man to fly but it wasn't
[39:36] verified all these things and you know
[39:37] now the Boeing 747 it boasts a total
[39:41] Cruise power of
[39:57] basically 60,000 horsepower that's a lot
[39:59] of horsepower right but you see that is
[40:02] nothing compared to the Space
[40:04] Shuttle NASA would boast that their
[40:07] space shuttle when it takes off it has
[40:09] 12 million
[40:11] horsepower see you later B 747 you see
[40:15] 12 million horsepower now brother B said
[40:17] now we are spiritual astronauts so you
[40:20] say so you take the power that's in a
[40:22] horse you multiply it by 12 million you
[40:25] got the power that it takes that's requ
[40:27] Reed for a person to leave this world's
[40:29] atmosphere to defy gravity and go into
[40:32] another world that we cannot see from
[40:35] here I'm talking about you can't see
[40:36] what it's like in space like being in
[40:38] space being on the earth you know what I
[40:39] mean you got to go and look at what does
[40:41] it look like from the space station
[40:42] looks totally different than it does
[40:44] here right so it takes 12 million
[40:46] horsepower to leave Earth's gravitation
[40:49] now brother Bram says that we Are
[40:51] Spiritual astronauts right so the power
[40:54] that was in a horse you times it by 12
[40:56] million You've Got The Power of a you've
[40:59] got the power of the Space Shuttle now
[41:01] this is far greater the power of the
[41:03] Space Shuttle is far greater than than a
[41:06] horse and buggy a b 747 or or electric
[41:09] Supercar right but there's a big
[41:11] difference now because remember he wants
[41:13] us to live in a realm of only belief he
[41:15] wants us to take God he wants us to take
[41:18] him totally just at his word not at what
[41:20] we think not at what we see taste feel
[41:22] smell hear imagine reason out he doesn't
[41:24] want us to live by those things he wants
[41:26] to live us take us from the five senses
[41:28] into a realm of faith and that's why God
[41:31] comes in trouble to prove himself cuz he
[41:33] wants to show you you have made a
[41:35] material that will take God at his word
[41:38] in spite of what your eyes tell you your
[41:39] hearing tells you your emotions tell you
[41:42] your reasoning tells you your conscience
[41:43] tells you you live in a realm you're
[41:46] built of a material that will take God
[41:48] at his word in spite of everything if
[41:50] everything is contrary to that word
[41:52] you've been made to take God just at his
[41:54] word
[41:55] amen praise God Amen Enoch took God at
[41:58] his word and he walked with God was not
[42:00] cuz God took him amen Noah took God at
[42:03] his word built the ark sa you know saved
[42:05] his house you know Moses took God at his
[42:07] word I mean went down to Egypt delivered
[42:09] the people Joshua took God at his word
[42:11] took the people into the promised land
[42:12] Elijah took God at his word amen and
[42:14] rebuilt the altar of the Lord the fire
[42:16] of God came down you know elishah took
[42:18] God at his word and wanted to follow
[42:19] Elijah and the mantle that was on Elijah
[42:21] came on Elisha you know all these ones
[42:24] took God at his word the disciples took
[42:26] God at his word John the Baptist took
[42:28] God at his word we're no different
[42:29] friends amen God has made I see I want
[42:32] you to see see remember end time
[42:34] evangelism brother bam says is Malachi 4
[42:37] the restoration back to the original
[42:39] Faith amen that is what M time
[42:42] evangelism is amen that's what the
[42:43] message has come to produce to return us
[42:45] back to the faith of the fathers where
[42:47] they just took God at his word amen amen
[42:50] so there's a big difference now now if
[42:53] you look at the if you look at the um
[42:56] you know the awesome buggy the car and
[42:58] the plane and and the space shutle
[43:01] there's a big difference in in those
[43:03] things now you have to physically drive
[43:06] a horse unless you know you've got to
[43:09] have the rains in your hand right right
[43:12] if you're flying a plane you there's
[43:13] times when you have autopilot on but
[43:15] you've got to drive the thing even even
[43:18] even cars that bow self-driving
[43:19] capability there's a time when you've
[43:21] got to drive it right you need to drive
[43:23] it this the astronauts that get into the
[43:26] space shuttle they don't drive it there
[43:29] is no human they are not there's not
[43:32] there they they don't drive what do they
[43:33] do they get on their astronaut suit amen
[43:36] amen and they walk into the space
[43:38] shuttle and they sit down and they put
[43:41] on their safety seat seat belt and they
[43:44] wait praise the Lord and then what
[43:47] happens it's Mission Control drives a
[43:49] space shuttle they cannot drive it
[43:52] themselves they will crash they'll
[43:53] because the way they have to go through
[43:55] the Earth's atmosphere is to be at a
[43:57] particular trajectory right it's yeah
[44:00] it's got to be a particular direction
[44:02] and it's the same thing with you and I
[44:04] it's when we give ourselves to the Lord
[44:06] and he takes over right that's the big
[44:08] thing many people say I've got to get
[44:09] the Holy Ghost no the Holy Ghost has got
[44:11] to get you and I it's when we quit we
[44:13] give up say Lord take my life that's
[44:15] when he takes you over amen so so it's a
[44:17] big difference a pilot can fly a plane
[44:20] but you don't fly a space shuttle amen
[44:23] I'm talking about leaving this Earth's
[44:24] atmosphere it's ground it's Mission
[44:26] Control that does the countdown it's not
[44:28] the astronaut says okay we're going to
[44:30] fly today no there's a whole bunch of
[44:32] studying of the weather the atmosphere's
[44:34] got to be just right how many times you
[44:36] heard of a launch be canceled there's
[44:38] too much Cloud there's Crosswinds
[44:39] there's there's winds right up in the
[44:41] atmosphere you can't see or feel but
[44:43] it's up there and they say we cannot
[44:45] launch today right so the atmosphere is
[44:47] going to be just right friends and I'll
[44:48] just tell you something I'm not a
[44:49] weather man but I got a different kind
[44:51] of a weather a weather pattern I'm
[44:53] looking at amen and God's word is saying
[44:55] the atmosphere is good amen for a launch
[44:57] amen we're living in the end of the
[44:59] seventh Church age where the Rapture is
[45:00] going to take place the weather's real
[45:02] good amen amen and you may not realize
[45:04] it but you're strapped into a rocket
[45:07] ship amen amen you're strapped in in
[45:09] spite of you see the astr could be
[45:11] sitting there and he could have trouble
[45:12] and think about what's going to happen
[45:14] when he's going on the mission and
[45:15] what's going to happen when he gets back
[45:16] home and what just happened this morning
[45:18] and there can be all kinds of things
[45:19] going on emotionally in him but he's
[45:22] strapped in the astronut you he's
[45:23] strapped in the space shuttle see it's
[45:25] not our feelings that get us wrapped
[45:27] ready it's the word of God Amen cuz
[45:29] remember now Rocket Fuel cometh by
[45:31] hearing I mean no faith cometh by
[45:33] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[45:35] see and that's why we get filled up with
[45:37] the word and the goodness of God God's
[45:39] pouring in Rocket Fuel am mean he's
[45:41] pouring in amen the the the the power to
[45:45] make us leave this world yes sir
[45:47] Hallelujah see it's not the astronaut no
[45:50] it's not human ambition that drives the
[45:52] space Shadle of the pilot no it is the
[45:55] ambition of mission control and we have
[45:58] a mission control it's not in Houston
[46:00] it's not in Mah here it's in glory amen
[46:02] that's our mission control and so he is
[46:04] he has placed Us by his word into his
[46:07] space shuttle because remember people
[46:10] are trying to get to Mars they want to
[46:11] live on a new world and that's only
[46:13] reflecting there's a people getting
[46:14] ready to leave this world and go not
[46:16] live on Mars thank God Amen but to go
[46:19] live in glory amen cuz why the natural
[46:21] types the spiritual Hallelujah so
[46:24] everyone's trying to get to the moon
[46:25] amen they want to get off the Earth to
[46:27] go to the Moon brother Ram says don't
[46:29] you see the spiritual application the
[46:31] spiritual astronaut got into Jesus
[46:33] listening to the countdown of the word
[46:35] of God and fixing to take off to Heaven
[46:37] Hallelujah that's you and I now if you
[46:40] look at if you look at you know you can
[46:43] wear the same clothes to ride a horse
[46:46] and buggy to drive a car or fly an
[46:49] airplane you can wear the same clothes I
[46:51] could do all three if I knew how to fly
[46:53] a well you I've been on a horse once but
[46:55] as was a horse track I think horse was
[46:57] driving me but you but you know I can
[46:59] ride a horse like this I can drive a car
[47:02] like this and I like well I probably
[47:03] crash a plane but you know I can still
[47:04] try and drive the plane you know but I
[47:06] need a space suit I need a different
[47:09] kind of a suit to go up into orbit amen
[47:12] I can't go with natural man you know for
[47:14] this atmosphere cuz we live in a
[47:16] different atmosphere an astronaut works
[47:19] and lives and dwells in a different
[47:21] atmosphere than an Earthbound atmosphere
[47:24] amen there's a different you know it's
[47:25] it's a totally different world World up
[47:27] there it is here and a world of faith is
[47:30] totally different to a natural man I
[47:32] mean because a natural man just looks at
[47:34] symptoms signs troubles and all these
[47:36] things but an astronaut or a spiritual
[47:39] astronaut sure those things are there we
[47:41] don't walk around like this in our hands
[47:43] like this and you know we don't walk
[47:44] around that sure we see all those things
[47:47] but Faith overrides them amen like
[47:51] Abraham he felt like he couldn't have a
[47:53] child he saw with his eyes if he had a
[47:55] mirror him old Sarah old you know their
[47:58] speech how they were the aches and pains
[48:01] all these things his five senses his his
[48:03] emotional real everything declared he
[48:05] could not have the child but faith
[48:08] overrode those things because it was a
[48:10] revelation he says Isaac's on his way
[48:13] amen it's the same thing with you and I
[48:14] we are built differently we've got you
[48:16] you know you're wearing an astronaut
[48:18] suit not like NASA builts but this is
[48:21] the best one this one's made to change
[48:23] dimensions in amen the baptism of the
[48:26] Holy Ghost amen is the astronaut suit
[48:29] Hallelujah that that that that the Lord
[48:31] has actually dressed Us in amen I trust
[48:34] everyone's worth me don't be nervous
[48:35] we'll be over soon amen but you see now
[48:37] you know we are We Are Spiritual um
[48:40] astronauts yes sir Hallelujah because if
[48:43] you got to see if your life is Lord I
[48:44] don't want my ambition I want his
[48:47] ambition I don't want my will I want his
[48:50] will I don't want to be glorified I
[48:51] don't care about me I want him to be
[48:53] glorified I want him to be made know I
[48:55] want him to be exalted in my life that's
[48:58] a good sign you're an astronaut
[48:59] hallelujah amen because there's a lot of
[49:01] you know that's a good sign you're an
[49:04] astronaut why cuz you're surrendered to
[49:05] Mission Control because Mission Control
[49:08] says astronauts you've got to get in the
[49:09] ship now they get in they sit in they're
[49:12] already amen and what do they do they
[49:14] hear sermon after
[49:16] sermon they're in meeting after meeting
[49:19] what's happening there's a there's a
[49:20] pipe being plugged into them cuz God's
[49:23] got some tanks hallel God's got some
[49:25] booster rocket tanks
[49:27] amen that are strapped to your suit
[49:28] strapped to you amen you don't feel them
[49:30] because hey Faith is light faith is not
[49:33] Grievous Faith doesn't wear you down
[49:35] Faith builds you up I mean the word of
[49:37] God preaching Faith doesn't make you
[49:38] worry it doesn't make you feel
[49:39] double-minded doesn't make you feel
[49:41] troubled it makes you feel empowered it
[49:43] makes you feel stable it makes you give
[49:45] you Vision see where you're going it
[49:47] gives you confidence it renews your
[49:48] strength amen that's what faith does so
[49:51] so so these tanks we carry are not heavy
[49:53] amen they're light amen and what is God
[49:55] God is filling up those tanks amen you
[49:58] open your Bible what's happening he's
[49:59] putting in the fuel line amen glug glug
[50:01] glug glug it's going up to full full and
[50:03] God knows and then but there's a lot of
[50:05] gauges that you know they check they're
[50:07] not just checking the atmosphere they're
[50:09] checking the whole thing I don't know
[50:11] how many senses I didn't Google it but
[50:13] there'd be probably a good maybe
[50:15] exaggeration but at least a million
[50:16] censes on a space shuttle cuz it cannot
[50:19] disintegrate when it flies amen so
[50:22] there' be a lot of test pre-flight tests
[50:24] they do you know I've seen I've sat
[50:26] there with brother Tony Murray in the um
[50:28] cockpit of a little plane that goes from
[50:31] well Nelson to here a little little
[50:33] thing and they're doing all these
[50:34] pre-flight checks they go through times
[50:36] that by a whole bunch and you've got a
[50:38] space shuttle there's all these
[50:40] pre-flight checks and that's why you
[50:42] know that's why God inspires Ministry to
[50:44] preach on love your neighbor don't hold
[50:47] grudges that Grudge T tank needs to be
[50:49] removed you can't have any grudges
[50:51] that's got to be taken out cuz that will
[50:53] hold you down you won't be able to fly
[50:55] with a grudge all the unbelief is burnt
[50:57] out by the Holy Ghost because unbelief
[50:59] tank we're we're taking because we have
[51:01] a lot of Earthbound things that Hold Us
[51:02] Down naturally that we're born with but
[51:04] God does a
[51:06] restoration not a Reformation a
[51:08] restoring of who we TR truly should be
[51:11] so The Grudges go the you know the
[51:13] unbelief tank goes the worry goes
[51:16] sometimes it takes a while to drain but
[51:18] it's going yeah amen you can look back
[51:20] maybe maybe you worried a lot a few
[51:22] years ago but now you're like hey praise
[51:23] God and people think you're blaz no
[51:25] you're not blaz you just trust in God
[51:27] more what's happening that worry tank is
[51:29] going away amen all the Fring and the
[51:31] stress and all those things anxiety goes
[51:33] why God is emptying you of those and
[51:35] pouring in faith hallel pouring in
[51:37] pouring in his word amen pouring in
[51:39] confidence Hallelujah that's what he's
[51:41] doing what is he doing he's getting you
[51:43] ready for a flight Hallelujah and it
[51:45] doesn't matter what the you know the
[51:47] devil's atmosphere he tries to put over
[51:49] you to stop you taking that potential
[51:50] flight the devil will never do it that's
[51:52] right brother Bram says in Christ your
[51:54] mystery of God revealed he says she
[51:56] won't be closed up speaking about the
[51:57] bride she'll be taken up amen so we
[51:59] won't she won't be closed up she'll be
[52:01] taken up amen so things may start
[52:03] looking bad and dark I don't know but we
[52:05] won't be closed up we'll be taken up
[52:07] hallelujah hallelujah so it doesn't
[52:09] matter what the devil tries to do now we
[52:11] can walk in confidence amen amen now so
[52:15] this is why it's so important we let God
[52:17] fill us with his word his tanks canot
[52:20] overflow you know get too full amen
[52:23] What's Your Capacity just enjoy them
[52:24] more amen and it's not in vain do you
[52:27] think every every ounce of the fuel
[52:29] because they calculate how much fuel
[52:30] they need on those on those space
[52:32] shuttles and they tailor it in Things
[52:34] based on the cargo capacity and whatever
[52:36] they're taking up into the space and so
[52:38] on all those things are worked out so
[52:41] every ounce or whatever fuel that they
[52:43] put in it's for a purpose it's not in
[52:47] vain so we hear the word you think maybe
[52:49] it's just Wednesday after Wednesday
[52:51] Sunday after Sunday God's working God's
[52:53] filling you up amen God's getting you
[52:55] ready and you've got the
[52:57] already amen the baptism of the Holy
[52:59] Ghost is there to ignite it amen so the
[53:01] so the fuel's getting filled up you're
[53:04] sitting in the tube I trust you're
[53:05] sitting in the
[53:06] tube and you're ready to
[53:09] go who who's like that who's like that
[53:14] now we have been proved to us over and
[53:18] over again the power of
[53:21] God brother BR says in the unfailing
[53:24] realities of the Living God because we
[53:25] got to realize that we can read through
[53:27] the Bible we can hear testimonies and
[53:29] and and what it really is to me is it's
[53:31] the proof of Rocket
[53:33] Fuel hallelu not just Enoch going in a
[53:35] Rapture not just Elijah going in a
[53:37] Rapture but everyday Believers down
[53:39] Through the Ages them living the life
[53:41] expressing the words for their age and
[53:43] whatever part of the body they meant to
[53:44] be and that's Rocket Fuel being tested I
[53:47] mean that and not just talked about you
[53:49] know I do I do environmental testing at
[53:52] my work and we'll look at different
[53:53] compositions of different uh milk powder
[53:56] and just just different things I'm not
[53:58] talking about just looking at what it's
[54:00] made of of the word I'm talking about
[54:02] the proof of it living the ignition of a
[54:05] like brother B says in um um uh it is
[54:08] the rising of the sun he says you take
[54:10] two cars both just off the assembly line
[54:13] just both made exactly the same and they
[54:16] can have a tank full of gasoline but
[54:18] only one has a spark plug the one that
[54:21] doesn't have the spark plug ain't going
[54:22] nowhere it can talk about how great it
[54:25] is it can you know look at it look at my
[54:27] stats look what I can do look how fast I
[54:29] can run look how far I can travel but
[54:31] without that spark plug it's going to
[54:33] sit right there amen so so the one with
[54:36] the spark plug has the baptism of the
[54:38] Holy Ghost it's got the fire to make the
[54:39] gasoline operate the engine make it
[54:42] start going and we have evidence after
[54:44] evidence of the rocket fuel of God Amen
[54:48] igniting in people's lives taking people
[54:50] to promises taking people through
[54:52] overcome you know trouble and you know
[54:54] you know with overcoming power now
[54:55] brother Bram says this here in the
[54:56] unfailing realities of the Living God
[54:59] now the holy spirit will not behave
[55:01] itself in one person oh sorry the holy
[55:03] spirit will not misbehave itself in one
[55:05] person and behave itself in another
[55:07] it'll make each person come into its
[55:10] character now that doesn't mean we're
[55:12] all become quiet all become loud all
[55:13] become boisterous introverted
[55:15] extroverted no it'll make us come into
[55:17] its character what is the character of
[55:19] Christ believing his word taking God at
[55:22] his word amen Above All Things see
[55:24] because it's the spirit that leads you
[55:26] it brings it makes you subject to its
[55:28] nature you don't bring it subject to
[55:31] your nature it makes you subject to its
[55:33] nature amen and the Holy Spirit makes
[55:36] you live and love uh to do it oh how you
[55:39] love to give up the things of the world
[55:40] when the Holy Spirit comes in how it
[55:43] cleanses you washes you and puts a
[55:45] desire in you to follow him and a thirst
[55:47] and a Hunger for More of it just bathing
[55:49] yourself he brings realities now when
[55:52] God placed man here in the days of the
[55:53] Lord Jesus he gave him a true road map
[55:56] to his power a road map is something
[55:59] that tells you tells you which way
[56:00] you're headed if you want to go when you
[56:02] leave the next few days I've crossed
[56:03] this country so much my wife and I were
[56:06] amazed to think of it just PD me for the
[56:09] last few years I could mention to you
[56:11] where you want to go I mean you could
[56:13] mention where you want to go I could
[56:14] tell you any road that leads to it and
[56:16] within 15 minutes of time you'll arrive
[56:18] from here to California I haven't missed
[56:20] it a time uh in um I don't know
[56:24] sometimes right to the dots Z
[56:25] calculating my time of what the driving
[56:27] time is and the average of time I've
[56:29] been just back and forward up and down
[56:32] back and forward till you just know it
[56:35] that's the way God wants us to know his
[56:37] word we know it we've traveled it we've
[56:39] tested it we've tried it and you know
[56:41] where it leads to amen how how true is
[56:44] that for you and I amen we've walked up
[56:46] and down his word we've tested it we've
[56:48] tried it amen we tried does the baptism
[56:50] name of Lord Jesus Christ work yes it
[56:52] does does a true repentance work yes it
[56:54] does can we receive the Holy Ghost like
[56:56] that in the book of Acts yes we can and
[56:58] yes we have does healing work yes it
[57:00] does does Deliverance work yes it does
[57:03] Amen does prayer work absolutely amen
[57:06] amen does living a holy life work
[57:08] absolutely does overcoming power is it a
[57:10] real thing yes it is why because we have
[57:13] tested it we've walked up and down it
[57:14] we've tried it amen and that's why I say
[57:16] so what have we done we have tested and
[57:18] proven and shown that it's Rocket Fuel
[57:22] amen it's not just the Believers of the
[57:23] old times but today we have tested
[57:26] by God's grace and and actually he's
[57:28] proved it Rocket Fuel let's be honest
[57:30] it's not us testing it it's him testing
[57:32] proving it to you cuz he wants you to
[57:34] know he's the same yesterday today and
[57:36] forever he wants you to know that he's
[57:37] alive and well and he wants you and I to
[57:40] know amen that his word is forever true
[57:42] amen hallelujah amen now his road map is
[57:45] his Bible the Bible is the road map that
[57:47] leads to the power of God faith leads
[57:50] you to the power power produces the
[57:52] promise amen and he says we need power
[57:55] and I'll say we have power amen God has
[57:57] given us Power by the baptism of the
[57:59] Holy Ghost amen by his presence living
[58:02] in you and I he has given us power to
[58:04] produce the promise not by our desire
[58:07] but by his desire not by our will but by
[58:10] his
[58:11] will praise the Lord hallelujah you see
[58:15] why he has made us to be spiritual
[58:17] Astron astronauts because he is
[58:19] conditioning us to live by faith alone
[58:22] that's what he wants us to do live by
[58:24] faith in his word alone he is preparing
[58:26] us praise God I'm so glad we're going
[58:29] forward aren't you we're not going
[58:30] backward we're not just going around a
[58:31] mountain aimlessly no we're walking into
[58:34] a greater walk with God we're walking
[58:36] into every promise amen you look at
[58:38] where you were and and and how much see
[58:40] God saved you what happened you walked
[58:42] into one promise that's a glorious
[58:45] promise Glory he took you out of Egypt
[58:47] it's a glorious promise you're baptized
[58:49] in his name that's another promise am
[58:51] mean he took you through a
[58:51] sanctification cleanse you and cleanse
[58:53] your spirit that's a great promise you
[58:55] cross Jordan death to sou you received
[58:57] the Holy Ghost that's a great promise he
[58:59] healed you that's another promise what
[59:00] is he doing he's leading you into all of
[59:02] his promises that's right amen isn't it
[59:05] a wonderful thing amen so how we know
[59:07] him now and how we used to know him we
[59:09] know him far greater now why cuz he's
[59:11] revealed himself more and more and
[59:13] that's why it's so important that we
[59:15] walk with God let him speak to us let
[59:18] him minister to us Amen Let Him reveal
[59:21] himself but you see he we have come to a
[59:24] place in our journey I believe that
[59:26] we're living by faith more than you
[59:28] realize brother Ram says in the church
[59:30] age book I don't have it here on me but
[59:32] he says you know we Marvel at the
[59:34] martyrs that gave their lives in the
[59:35] arena do we not and those who are
[59:37] tortured they suffered terrible things
[59:39] and we think how could we ever do that
[59:43] but he says we fail to realize the same
[59:45] Faith they had to overcome in their day
[59:48] is the same faith we have to overcome an
[59:51] everyday life am mean cuz remember we
[59:53] are we are anointed to overcome the
[59:55] challenge of our day our challenge is
[59:58] different to their challenge amen we're
[59:59] not being rounded up thrown to Arena and
[1:00:01] feed the Lions we're not tortured like
[1:00:03] that we're not you know but the same
[1:00:05] faith we have because what causes us to
[1:00:08] overcome the world our faith faith is
[1:00:10] the victory amen so so our everyday life
[1:00:14] we live we are overcoming amen praise
[1:00:17] the Lord to be a believer in Satan's
[1:00:19] Eden is a glorious thing it's a
[1:00:21] supernatural thing where you walk in a
[1:00:24] realm of faith and you're sure the World
[1:00:26] tries to grab you and try to get your
[1:00:27] attention but something in you says no
[1:00:30] I'll not bow amen that's right praise
[1:00:32] God I may wrestle I may fight but I'm
[1:00:34] not giving up I'm not quitting I'm
[1:00:36] walking on with God I will not let this
[1:00:38] world devour me I'm going to walk on its
[1:00:40] head I'm going to walk Victorious
[1:00:42] doesn't matter what's going on what
[1:00:44] what's happened that is Supernatural yes
[1:00:46] amen you're you're a supernatural thing
[1:00:48] sure was a supernatural thing for people
[1:00:50] to be murdered at all those things they
[1:00:51] are anointed to do it amen but we're
[1:00:54] under an eagle anointing the same holy
[1:00:55] GH in a different way they Anointed with
[1:00:57] an ox anointing they
[1:00:59] overcame Hallelujah I believe I you know
[1:01:03] I believe with all my heart there be
[1:01:04] such a there was such a joy in them cuz
[1:01:06] they realized what they're about to go
[1:01:08] through wasn't their end they were going
[1:01:09] to see him they're going to see the one
[1:01:11] that suffered and died for them just in
[1:01:12] a few minutes they're going to be in his
[1:01:14] presence amen and if we just keep that
[1:01:16] Joy before us couldn't be maybe it's not
[1:01:18] many days now these bodies will be
[1:01:20] changed
[1:01:22] Hallelujah we have a different kind of
[1:01:25] pressure than they did but how they
[1:01:27] overcame is the same way we
[1:01:29] overcome so don't diminish your
[1:01:31] Christian
[1:01:33] Walk Don't diminish your don't diminish
[1:01:35] what God has done in your life don't let
[1:01:37] the devil try and put you down saying
[1:01:39] you're nothing and you're a ladyo and
[1:01:40] you're not getting anywhere no we are
[1:01:42] the Overcomers of this age amen God has
[1:01:44] built you to be an overcomer just like
[1:01:46] astronauts they're selected not just
[1:01:48] anyone you know you can't just go what
[1:01:50] are you going to be when you grow up I'm
[1:01:51] going to be an astronaut many people say
[1:01:53] it but many are called you can say but
[1:01:55] few are
[1:01:57] right many try and join but there's only
[1:01:59] a few that actually get on I don't know
[1:02:01] how many astronauts lined up to be where
[1:02:02] Buzz Aldren and um thingy Armstrong was
[1:02:06] that landed on the moon I don't know how
[1:02:08] many men or women lined up to try and
[1:02:10] get that job two got it right and you
[1:02:13] think about it in the natural people
[1:02:15] have an ambition I want to become that
[1:02:17] but when we're born we have no ambition
[1:02:19] to serve God there's nothing within man
[1:02:21] that actually wants to be a spiritual at
[1:02:23] um astronaut the Bible says it
[1:02:26] right so it's not us enlisting saying I
[1:02:28] want to be that it's actually God comes
[1:02:29] down and says this is who you are I'm
[1:02:32] going to reveal who you really are amen
[1:02:34] and he reveals himself to you you give
[1:02:35] your life to him and what does he do he
[1:02:37] opens your eyes to see I'm a spiritual
[1:02:39] astronaut I'm ordained to sit in that
[1:02:41] Rapture chair Amen brother Braham says
[1:02:44] that when Elijah went up on that in that
[1:02:46] Chariot of fire he says every every Bush
[1:02:48] and tree had a had a chariot hitched but
[1:02:52] they've got your name on
[1:02:53] it hallelujah amen they've got your name
[1:02:56] on it so God has called you because he
[1:02:58] sees within you you're an
[1:03:00] astronaut amen but he wants us to leave
[1:03:02] the five senses behind and walk by faith
[1:03:06] just to take God at his
[1:03:09] word amen see but when the six sense
[1:03:12] comes in faith it denies all of those
[1:03:15] things what faith um see taste feel
[1:03:19] smile hear all those things and moves a
[1:03:20] person straight into the bosoms of God
[1:03:22] he that cometh to God must believe that
[1:03:24] he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:03:26] diligently seek Him by Faith by faith
[1:03:28] Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob
[1:03:30] all by faith it's the sixth s sent that
[1:03:33] does it Sixth Sense denies all symptom
[1:03:36] all symptoms anything contrary to God's
[1:03:38] word any feeling emotion somebody say oh
[1:03:41] well I was prayed for but I didn't feel
[1:03:43] any better Faith would never stand still
[1:03:46] for that the six sense would say it's a
[1:03:48] lie I feel better and I'm getting well
[1:03:50] if remember faith is a revelation if
[1:03:53] it's been revealed to you you can walk
[1:03:55] into that take everything else contrary
[1:03:57] to that if it's being revealed see it's
[1:03:59] the super sense it's the super above the
[1:04:02] senses it's a greater sense it's a faith
[1:04:04] it's a power that stirs and drives amen
[1:04:06] it's something that makes you do things
[1:04:08] that you never thought you would do it's
[1:04:09] the Sixth Sense the super sense that's
[1:04:13] why Revelation is more important you got
[1:04:15] re Revelation is more important than you
[1:04:17] realize that God himself has revealed
[1:04:20] himself personally to you that's a
[1:04:23] powerful thing you can't earn it you
[1:04:24] can't work it out you can't study enough
[1:04:26] you can't try and be humanly good enough
[1:04:28] God does it
[1:04:30] sovereignly amen so then well well then
[1:04:32] what's the point of trying the no if you
[1:04:34] believe that he is and he's a see he you
[1:04:38] must believe that he is and is a
[1:04:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:04:41] Him amen so if so if you know he's real
[1:04:45] then you seek him you'll be rewarded for
[1:04:47] it you'll find him you'll get what you
[1:04:49] need amen I trust that came out okay see
[1:04:52] some people say there's no such thing
[1:04:54] you know an atheist Infidel was was
[1:04:56] challenging some people thisen the
[1:04:57] message of super sense and you know
[1:05:00] there's a you know there's an Infidel
[1:05:01] saying you there's no such thing as God
[1:05:03] it's all emotion and you know there you
[1:05:05] know it's just all nonsense and brother
[1:05:07] BR said there was a guy there and you
[1:05:08] know he was just eating an apple while
[1:05:10] this guy is pouring it into these
[1:05:12] Christians saying there's nothing to it
[1:05:14] this man's eating this apple and then
[1:05:16] and then he stops eating his apple and
[1:05:17] he ask the guy saying there's no such
[1:05:18] thing as God says what does my Apple
[1:05:20] taste like is it sweet or is it sour and
[1:05:23] the guy looks at him annoyed saying how
[1:05:24] do I know I'm not e the Apple the guy
[1:05:26] says I thought so just walks off why but
[1:05:29] same thing with God unless you taste and
[1:05:31] see that he is good amen then an
[1:05:34] argument will never stack up to a
[1:05:36] testimony see the man eating the Apple
[1:05:38] had tasted the see before he ever tasted
[1:05:40] it you could debate well it's a granny
[1:05:42] smith it must taste like this it's a br
[1:05:43] bur it must taste like this a whatever
[1:05:45] an eve apple or whatever Apple it must
[1:05:47] but when he tasted there's no more
[1:05:49] debate in his mind cuz he's tasted the
[1:05:51] apple he knows exactly what it's like
[1:05:53] and it's the same thing with the Lord
[1:05:55] once you taste and see that he is good
[1:05:57] amen amen that he is alive and he is a
[1:05:59] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:06:00] him all the debate has
[1:06:03] gone praise the Lord amen I'm so glad
[1:06:07] for that Hallelujah now he is as I said
[1:06:12] now and I'm just going to finish soon
[1:06:15] with this as I said that we are we are
[1:06:18] um dressed in a astronaut suit amen it
[1:06:22] is it is made to live in a different
[1:06:24] Realm
[1:06:26] okay now the believer is covered by the
[1:06:29] blood it that is the best armor that is
[1:06:32] the best protection that is the
[1:06:34] astronaut suit amen if you're covered in
[1:06:37] the blood you see an astronaut suit can
[1:06:39] go into a realm with these clothes well
[1:06:41] I just explode in in space I'm not
[1:06:43] pressurized in these clothes my eyeballs
[1:06:45] would explode I'd freeze I'd be gone but
[1:06:48] if I'm in an astronaut suit same man in
[1:06:50] a different suit I'll be fine in any
[1:06:52] condition on Mars I'll be fine on the
[1:06:54] moon I'll be fine and the rocket I'll be
[1:06:55] fine outside the rock it'll be fine even
[1:06:57] on the earth I'm fine in my suit amen
[1:07:00] it's the same thing being covered in the
[1:07:02] blood of Jesus Christ amen it doesn't
[1:07:05] matter what the devil tries to do
[1:07:07] doesn't matter how much he comes against
[1:07:08] you it doesn't matter how much trouble
[1:07:10] comes in your life you're dressed to
[1:07:12] you're dressed for the occasion you're
[1:07:14] dressed to overcome amen you are dressed
[1:07:16] that the that the devil cannot win amen
[1:07:18] that no weapon formed against you shall
[1:07:20] prosper it is the best covering amen
[1:07:24] Sheen's got nothing on it come on now
[1:07:27] hallelujah amen nothing of this world
[1:07:30] compares to being covered by the blood
[1:07:32] praise the Lord didn't get many amens
[1:07:35] there that's fine but hey we see maybe
[1:07:40] I'm just going to go down this track for
[1:07:41] a while we're going to realize who we
[1:07:42] are now amen that's right that's why I
[1:07:44] read the opening scripture now we are
[1:07:46] the sons of God not one day oh one day
[1:07:49] our will be one day one day one day no
[1:07:51] no now now we are the sons of God right
[1:07:54] now your present State now you're a son
[1:07:57] or daughter of God Amen Hallelujah
[1:08:00] you're in your astronaut tube you're in
[1:08:02] your spaceship and you're dressed in
[1:08:04] that in the see it's not one day like
[1:08:06] Brother David silus said at the camp
[1:08:08] many people put the carrot far away like
[1:08:10] a carrot before a donkey one day you'll
[1:08:12] be like this one day you'll be like no
[1:08:13] no we are now God has made us now amen
[1:08:17] we don't need another message to perfect
[1:08:19] the bride we don't need another word we
[1:08:20] don't need someone else to come and open
[1:08:22] the word to us no Christ is fully
[1:08:24] revealed amen and he has appeared Among
[1:08:27] Us so when we see him we shall be like
[1:08:28] he is amen and he has appeared in these
[1:08:31] last days his spirit is upon the Earth
[1:08:34] proving his word amen and so what does
[1:08:36] he make us like him how's that we
[1:08:38] believe his word we take him at his
[1:08:40] word hallelujah but you see now we are
[1:08:43] walking see he does not see us you got
[1:08:45] to realize if you're in in this
[1:08:47] astronaut suit you're covered from head
[1:08:49] to toe and toe too right there's not one
[1:08:51] part of you who's ever seen them when
[1:08:53] there's like the film over there you
[1:08:55] know they're outside in space you can't
[1:08:57] see their face you can't see any part of
[1:08:59] them they're covered in an asut suit
[1:09:01] right and it's the same thing if you're
[1:09:03] covered when you're covered in the blood
[1:09:04] of Jesus Christ when God looks at you he
[1:09:07] doesn't see you glory he doesn't see
[1:09:10] your Humanity he doesn't see your
[1:09:12] mistakes he doesn't see your mind
[1:09:13] battles he doesn't see your trouble no
[1:09:15] he hears your voice through his blood
[1:09:18] Hallelujah he hears your voice through
[1:09:20] his blood you see we can get so caught
[1:09:23] up with the man in the astronaut suit
[1:09:25] that we forget about the suit who's ever
[1:09:28] been maybe brother M and you've been up
[1:09:29] in the bush but you're wearing the right
[1:09:30] kind of clothing you got confidence in
[1:09:32] your clothing right you know if I go up
[1:09:35] there with you in this the weather
[1:09:36] changes man I'm going to be an icicle on
[1:09:39] a hillside you just march on fine why
[1:09:42] because you're dressed you're dressed
[1:09:43] for the conditions amen it's the same
[1:09:46] and you have confidence in your clothing
[1:09:47] right so the same thing with you and I
[1:09:49] we're going to have confidence in the
[1:09:51] blood of Jesus Christ we must have
[1:09:53] confidence in our clothing that no
[1:09:54] matter where we go we're
[1:09:57] safe Hallelujah why because he doesn't
[1:09:59] see us just like an astronaut you don't
[1:10:01] see the astronaut in the suit you just
[1:10:03] see the
[1:10:04] suit amen and when God sees us he
[1:10:07] doesn't see our Humanity he sees the
[1:10:10] blood of his own son see see there's an
[1:10:13] interview that you know there's a it's
[1:10:14] called private interview interview of
[1:10:16] sister Bruce and sister Bruce is worried
[1:10:18] about the astronaut in the suit herself
[1:10:20] but she's forgetting what she's clothed
[1:10:22] in amen and then how many of us because
[1:10:25] we just living everyday Christian Life
[1:10:27] we think well we're not really getting
[1:10:29] anywhere but I say the tanks are being
[1:10:30] filled up we are not retreating we're
[1:10:33] advancing amen and then so she's
[1:10:35] wondering is everything okay with her
[1:10:38] but she didn't realize that the life she
[1:10:40] was living presently was how how God
[1:10:42] wanted her to be because she was built a
[1:10:45] certain way that she'd get someone in
[1:10:47] her heart and she would pray through for
[1:10:49] them and that was her position in the
[1:10:51] body she's just living life I don't know
[1:10:54] if she had a job I what she did you know
[1:10:56] outside of church all these things but
[1:10:58] she was walking in her astronaut suit
[1:11:00] living everyday Christian Life in her
[1:11:03] pre-ordained position by God and she's
[1:11:06] wondering is she really fine so she
[1:11:07] asked the prophet about it he says now
[1:11:10] brother Braham says this just coming
[1:11:11] halfway well most the way through the
[1:11:13] interview says but remember me being a
[1:11:15] sinner and before God I'm not a sinner
[1:11:17] neither are you right we've got a blood
[1:11:20] sacrifice laying there God don't even
[1:11:22] see us he hears our voice but he sees
[1:11:24] the blood blood of Christ that's it he
[1:11:26] sees the blood of his own son it's our
[1:11:28] voice Christ's blood then it's Christ
[1:11:31] that's talking through us to God so
[1:11:33] therefore we're not Sinners no more we
[1:11:35] are
[1:11:37] Christian how many times people they
[1:11:39] they fall they fail they and they feel
[1:11:41] like they need to go back and start
[1:11:43] walking with God like go back to you
[1:11:44] know like playing Monopoly you know you
[1:11:47] pick up a chance card or a community
[1:11:49] whatever and you got to go back to go
[1:11:51] you know you're about to buy that big
[1:11:52] property everything's going to be a
[1:11:54] great big victory but you pick up this
[1:11:55] card you got to go back to the start
[1:11:57] it's the same thing many Christians they
[1:11:59] fall they fail they think they go back
[1:12:00] and start get saved all over again no
[1:12:03] but no but the thing is you got to
[1:12:05] realize if you've really given your life
[1:12:06] to the Lord you don't go save sinner
[1:12:09] save sinner save sinner all the time no
[1:12:12] you go from sinner to saved sure we've
[1:12:15] got to confess our sins and make things
[1:12:16] right right but it doesn't mean we got
[1:12:18] to get saved all over again who's with
[1:12:19] me who understands what I mean we're not
[1:12:21] going back and forth all the time no
[1:12:23] we're Christians just like he said we
[1:12:25] are no more Sinners we are Christian
[1:12:28] amen praise God Amen I believe you to be
[1:12:31] a genuine Christian woman brother says I
[1:12:33] remember says but sister Bruce says I
[1:12:35] make so many mistakes I fail so many
[1:12:37] times then brother R says that's why
[1:12:39] Christ had to die so that you with your
[1:12:41] mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you amen
[1:12:44] so let's stop looking at the man in the
[1:12:46] suit and start looking at the quality of
[1:12:48] the suit the quality of the word that
[1:12:50] we're covered in the power of his blood
[1:12:52] amen see that's why Christ had sorry I'm
[1:12:55] just repeating this but so that you with
[1:12:57] your mistakes wouldn't be a lot of to
[1:12:58] you see he took your mistakes you desire
[1:13:00] in your heartest to serve him sister
[1:13:02] Bruce says yes all right that's what he
[1:13:04] died for so you could serve him see your
[1:13:06] mistakes are not looked not lted to you
[1:13:09] see he is your propitiation see he is
[1:13:11] your sin offering your sins are not
[1:13:13] known you're not a sinner before God
[1:13:16] Christ took your sins and became you
[1:13:19] because your desire is to serve
[1:13:22] him I think that's a marvelous thing yes
[1:13:26] don't you think so that we can that we
[1:13:28] can realize you know if we can realize
[1:13:31] who we really are not one day we are
[1:13:35] we're not
[1:13:36] Sinners
[1:13:38] anymore you say well I'm living in the
[1:13:41] same house yeah but another one's come
[1:13:42] and lived in here amen if God steps in
[1:13:46] faith really steps in amen it's not you
[1:13:48] living no more it's Christ Living in you
[1:13:50] you may look like the same old person
[1:13:52] but there's a different life going on in
[1:13:53] here amen the life you were born with
[1:13:55] did all kind of crazy stuff I know from
[1:13:57] my experience but then one day God
[1:13:59] stepped in God came and said hey you're
[1:14:01] an astronaut you're not meant to be an
[1:14:02] Earthbound creature going up and down in
[1:14:04] the with the clouds and the troubles and
[1:14:06] all these things no fly up into the
[1:14:07] Heavenly Realms of only belief amen and

[1:14:22] acronym it would be but you know we're
[1:14:24] not working for NASA we're living for
[1:14:25] the king Hallelujah so in these times of
[1:14:29] trouble God wants to prove to you you're
[1:14:32] an astronaut that you can live in a
[1:14:34] realm of I Take God at his word amen he
[1:14:38] he had to prove to Abraham who who
[1:14:40] Abraham really was Abraham thought he
[1:14:42] was from the cheles and he was an idol
[1:14:45] worshiper and all these things but God
[1:14:46] called him out because God knew in him
[1:14:48] he was the father of Faith but God had
[1:14:50] to show to Abraham who Abraham was just
[1:14:54] like Gideon he thought thought he was a
[1:14:55] cow he was you know he was threshing
[1:14:57] wheat and secret all these things but in
[1:14:59] that time of trouble God had to prove to
[1:15:01] Gideon what Gideon was made of see David

[1:15:12] you and I God wants to prove to you in
[1:15:14] times of trouble who you really are but

[1:15:18] senses he wants us to live by faith
[1:15:21] alone and SP no matter what I see no

[1:16:09] where he said not my will but thy will
[1:16:10] be done popularity pulled him different
[1:16:12] things pulled him but he had to walk by
[1:16:14] faith alone and God wants us to walk the
