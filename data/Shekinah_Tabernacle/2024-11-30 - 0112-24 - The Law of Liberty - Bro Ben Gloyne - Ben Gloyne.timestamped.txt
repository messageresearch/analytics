[35:08] one the law of Liberty is a very good
[35:10] one amen so amen just going to read here
[35:12] so Psalm 119:
[35:15] 41-48 he says let thy mercies come also
[35:18] unto me oh Lord even thy salvation
[35:20] according to Thy word so shall I have uh
[35:23] wherewith to answer him that reproacheth
[35:25] me for I trust in Thy Word and take not
[35:28] the word of Truth utterly out of my
[35:30] mouth for I have hoped in thy judgments
[35:32] so shall I keep thy law continually
[35:34] forever and ever and I will walk at
[35:37] liberty for I seek thy precepts I will
[35:39] speak of thy testimonies also before
[35:41] Kings and will not be ashamed and I'll
[35:44] Del Delight myself in thy Commandments
[35:46] which I have loved my hands also will I
[35:49] lift up uh unto thy Commandments which I
[35:51] have loved and I'll meditate in thy
[35:54] statutes amen so let's uh let's bow our
[35:56] heads in word of prayer this morning
[35:57] morning if you have a need you just want
[35:58] to slip your hand up to the Lord amen
[36:00] gracious father we thank you so much as
[36:02] we have have gathered this day Lord in
[36:04] your great presence we want to First
[36:06] tell you we love you with all our hearts
[36:07] today thank you for what you've done and
[36:09] what you're doing Lord we praise your
[36:11] mighty name we thank you that Lord that
[36:13] truly the gospel is the good news Lord
[36:16] father thank you Lord It's good news for
[36:17] us we want to praise your name this
[36:19] morning asking Lord you'd have
[36:20] preeminence I pray that Lord your blood
[36:23] Lord I plead your blood over us as a
[36:24] people Lord over everyone who may be
[36:26] streaming as well may you be our portion
[36:28] Lord this day may you anoint your word
[36:30] as we've read it Lord anoint speaker and
[36:32] hearer dear God may you just come and
[36:34] take complete control us want to get
[36:35] myself out of the way for you to do what
[36:37] you want to do father so may you have
[36:39] your way we love you Lord we thank you
[36:41] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[36:44] bless you friends you can have your
[36:45] seats this morning so I want to talk
[36:47] about the law of
[36:49] Liberty which which we uh find ourselves
[36:51] under this morning amen so as we read
[36:54] here in Psalms David will be writing I
[36:56] will walk at liberty for I seek thy
[36:58] precept so there is a there's a liberty
[37:00] for the people of God now we know that
[37:03] uh in in um you Paul would Paul would
[37:06] speak of these things and he'd say you
[37:08] know uh here in 2 Corinthians he's
[37:10] speaking with Moses and how Moses's face
[37:13] was veiled and the hearts of Israel were
[37:15] veiled but in the in Christ that Veil
[37:17] will be taken away but he's saying now
[37:19] where the Spirit uh now the Lord is that
[37:21] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[37:23] is there is liberty so there's not
[37:25] bondage there's not depression there's
[37:28] not a heavy weight that binds us down
[37:30] but there's a liberty for us to walk as
[37:33] God would have us walk and be as God
[37:35] made us to be amen but we with all with
[37:37] open face beholding as in a glass the
[37:39] glory of the Lord are changed into that
[37:42] into the same image from glory to glory
[37:44] even as by the spirit of the Lord so
[37:47] there now there is Liberty I pray that
[37:49] we would you have have such a time of
[37:52] Liberty not just in service but but in
[37:54] our everyday life that we can walk as
[37:57] God would ordain us to walk now this
[38:00] word liberty and and I think maybe in
[38:02] this day and age we kind of forget about
[38:04] the uh because we live in a a a a a
[38:07] country of Liberty that's right you can
[38:09] believe what you want to believe you can
[38:11] dress how you want to dress you can do
[38:12] what you want to do there's no in terms
[38:14] of social constructs we have great
[38:17] Liberty but in the but uh but I'm not
[38:20] talking about a a a a natural Liberty
[38:22] I'm talking about a spiritual Liberty
[38:25] now now the Apostle Paul would say when
[38:26] he speaking about Liberty here it say
[38:29] it'd say to go as to be unrestrained so
[38:32] to go at pleasure so basically to do
[38:34] what your desire would be to do now we
[38:36] know when in the Lord this is a desire
[38:38] to do as God would have you do right and
[38:41] that is to be as a citizen not a slave
[38:44] and it means whether to be either
[38:46] Freeborn or ma uh manumitted however you
[38:48] say that which means someone who's been
[38:50] released from slavery so he's saying it
[38:52] doesn't matter what state you were born
[38:54] into or found yourself in you can go
[38:56] free as a citizen now if we're a citizen
[38:58] of a kingdom or or a nation you've got
[39:01] the rights of that Nation right so as a
[39:03] New Zealand citizen I have the rights as
[39:05] a New Zealand citizen to to to to live
[39:08] under the rights of this nation now if I
[39:10] was under a different Nation I'd have
[39:12] different rights so for example if I was
[39:14] living in Afghanistan I'd have different
[39:16] rights to New Zealand you know if I
[39:18] lived in America if I lived in different
[39:20] parts of the earth I'd have different
[39:21] rights based on my citizenship right now
[39:23] we have a we have greater than Earthly
[39:26] citizenship I pray you just just you
[39:28] know let's have church today all right
[39:30] let's have church today amen because
[39:32] because remember the purpose of the
[39:33] message is for us to be reminded and
[39:35] told who we are in Christ right that's
[39:38] the whole purpose of the of of of
[39:40] Malachi 4 coming to turn our hearts back
[39:42] to the faith of the fathers is that we
[39:44] would know who we are and we need to be
[39:46] reminded who we are amen I think it's
[39:48] very important we know who we are
[39:50] because the devil in this day wants to
[39:52] mix up everyone's
[39:53] identity right so that's why I just want
[39:55] to talk about these things and I've
[39:57] spoken about these things before but we
[39:58] find ourselves here again amen so now we
[40:01] have a citizenship in heaven right so so
[40:03] therefore we have the rights of Heaven
[40:06] hallelujah amen so we have the rights of
[40:08] Heaven amen so so we don't have the you
[40:10] know so when when we're in this law of
[40:12] Liberty which we are if you're in Christ
[40:14] amen then then we don't live under the
[40:16] under the slavery of the devil anymore
[40:19] we don't live based on these five senses
[40:22] right we don't live based on this flesh
[40:23] we don't walk according to our feelings
[40:25] or the vibe or you know things are going
[40:28] on no no we walk by the word right
[40:30] because we're under a different
[40:31] citizenship see when we're born we
[40:33] walked by our flesh very much so you he
[40:36] children I want this I want this I need
[40:38] this I want this it's all about what
[40:39] their flesh wants right that's why
[40:41] McDonald's is a multi-billion Dollar
[40:43] business is because it panders to the
[40:45] Flesh and it's and it's popular because
[40:47] they've tapped into what what taste buds
[40:50] and how to manipulate all those things
[40:51] and price points and whatever more and
[40:53] it's very popular it would never be
[40:56] popular if it was super healthy and very
[40:59] Bland it would have closed long the
[41:01] first McDonald's would have been the
[41:03] last McDonald's right but you see but
[41:05] you see because it panders to the flesh
[41:07] it it it it pulls people in by an
[41:09] Earthly desire and that's how we're born
[41:11] that way right but we live under a
[41:13] different citizenship if you know the
[41:15] Lord see more than just coming to church
[41:16] if you know Christ you're in a different
[41:18] citizenship amen you live in a different
[41:20] whole world than than this world would
[41:23] live amen so we we are unrestrained so
[41:26] whatever is restraining you this morning
[41:27] you got to realize you're under a law of
[41:29] Liberty that that that that that thing
[41:32] that holds you back must let go in the
[41:34] name of Jesus Christ amen because we are
[41:36] called to go as unrestrained now if we
[41:39] look into uh here with um you know the
[41:43] Lord would the Lord would stand in
[41:44] Nazareth now to me it's amazing when you
[41:47] look at what he's going to declare to to
[41:49] the
[41:51] Jews they've had four 400 years of
[41:53] Silence from Malachi till John now the
[41:56] Messiah himself is standing in flesh he
[41:58] he came to church this was his custom to
[42:00] go to church and uh so he would stand up
[42:02] and he was given the book of The Prophet
[42:05] Isaias and when he had opened the book
[42:07] he found the place that it was written
[42:09] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[42:10] because he had anointed me to preach the
[42:12] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[42:14] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[42:15] Deliverance of the captives and the
[42:17] recovering of the sight to the blind to
[42:19] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[42:21] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[42:23] and he closed the book and he gave it
[42:25] again to the minister and sat down
[42:27] and the eyes of all them that were in
[42:29] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[42:31] he began to say unto them this day is
[42:33] the scripture fulfilled in your ear and
[42:35] all bear him witness and wondered at the
[42:37] gracious Words which proceeded out of
[42:39] his mouth and and they said is this not
[42:42] Joseph's son so to me this is amazing
[42:45] when you see the word himself opens the
[42:47] book and then and then begins to reveal
[42:50] to the people this is their inheritance
[42:52] this is the season you live in you're
[42:54] not going to live under the blood of
[42:55] bulls and goats no more where it's a you
[42:56] know but you're going to but but the the
[42:59] spirit of God is here to set you at
[43:01] Liberty to set you in Freedom Amen to to
[43:04] to deliver you from these things so you
[43:06] know when you think about who was
[43:08] declaring this it was not a religious
[43:11] leader declaring this it was not a a
[43:13] leader of a bible school that had a nice
[43:15] idea that maybe put some scriptures
[43:17] together and you know tied some things
[43:18] and say this is what it means no this is
[43:20] The Interpreter of the word himself
[43:23] standing there in flesh opening the book
[43:25] declaring what was in the book to them
[43:27] you see so it was incredible how this
[43:29] was the Messiah himself telling them
[43:32] this is the season you're living in I'm
[43:33] going to set you at Liberty the prophecy
[43:35] of Isaiah that maybe people debated
[43:37] maybe they talked about maybe they would
[43:39] wrestle with was now living in front of
[43:41] them and they were and they were living
[43:43] in it amen but you see how often is it
[43:46] that spirits will come and try and take
[43:48] someone else's inheritance and place it
[43:50] on someone else you know how often that
[43:52] spirits will come and displace the word
[43:54] for people like for example you know
[43:56] I've been talking I don't think we're
[43:57] going to be talking much more but
[43:58] talking with a sect or a group that
[44:00] think that they are the 144,000 Jews
[44:03] they're not Jewish at all they're
[44:05] gentile people they think it's some
[44:06] tribes and you you know they think
[44:08] they're the Lost tribe of Israel and
[44:09] they think that you know the day of the
[44:11] Jew is over there's no more grace for
[44:14] them you know they are they are it I
[44:16] thought what a deceiving spirit that
[44:18] would come along because we know the
[44:20] Bible tells us that the Jews have three
[44:22] and A2 years of Grace allocated to them
[44:24] still am mean as Paul would say in the
[44:26] Book of Romans he said he said that they
[44:28] are blinded until the fullness of the
[44:29] Gentiles comes in right and the prophecy
[44:32] of Daniel says that there's 3 and 1/2
[44:34] years of Daniel 70 weeks that that that
[44:36] is for the Jews right we know these
[44:38] things you know there's prophecy in
[44:40] Zechariah saying that he'll o open the
[44:42] fountain in the House of David for them
[44:44] right so so what is causing them to
[44:46] think they are they are someone else's
[44:48] inheritance it's not God right it's not
[44:51] God it's some it's it's a spirit that's
[44:53] come along and how many other groups are
[44:55] out there saying they're the 144,000
[44:57] they are not the Jews are right but what
[45:00] happens is that there's a promise given
[45:02] to a people and the devil will take that
[45:04] try and take that promise from them and
[45:06] give it to another group of people and
[45:08] how often does he come to you now and
[45:10] try and make you think the promises of
[45:12] God are not yours I mean to try and make
[45:14] you think that they for someone else
[45:15] they're from a different age therefore
[45:17] for maybe in the future somewhere but
[45:19] the Bible says today is the day of
[45:21] salvation I mean today is the day of the
[45:23] promises of God I mean that's what our
[45:25] God tells us does he not amen so we're
[45:27] got to realize that whenever a thought
[45:29] comes into your mind that no you know
[45:31] maybe you're not the bride maybe you
[45:32] won't overcome maybe you'll never get
[45:34] out of this problem I mean that's a
[45:36] spirit trying to dispossess you of a
[45:37] promise but you've got to look into the
[45:39] law of Liberty of the word of God and
[45:41] see what it speaks about you and
[45:43] actually look at that and continue it
[45:44] and say no God you've given me the
[45:46] promise it wasn't a man that gave me the
[45:48] promise it was you amen amen because
[45:52] we're living in a day where everyone's
[45:55] inheritance is being allotted out that's
[45:57] right just like in Moses's day when they
[45:59] were traveling from from Egypt into the
[46:01] promised land and you know Moses would
[46:03] tell the children of Israel you know
[46:04] you're going to pass through Moab don't
[46:06] fuss with them that's their inheritance
[46:08] I mean Edom that's their inheritance
[46:10] leave them there these different ones
[46:11] you all the all the nations around were
[46:14] allocated an inheritance right but the
[46:17] but the thing is with the with the
[46:19] believer now you know they belonged on
[46:21] the right side of Jordan they did not
[46:23] belong on the Wilderness side of Jordan
[46:24] their inheritance was going to be on the
[46:26] right right side of Jordan but it was
[46:28] what kept a half the tribe of Manassa
[46:30] and different tribes out of the promised
[46:32] land is because they looked at the
[46:34] cattle they had and said well actually
[46:36] this side of Jordan the wrong side of
[46:37] Jordan is the place for what we actually
[46:40] have right now so what they brought with
[46:42] them hindered them from going into the
[46:43] land what they should have done is said
[46:45] well God you we've got this cattle
[46:47] you've gave us the cattle if you want it
[46:49] in the land you'll bring it over with us
[46:51] if not well we're going to have a cattle
[46:52] sale and the price of beef is going to
[46:54] go way down because the Market's going
[46:56] to be flooding
[46:57] right but what they did instead is they
[46:59] said well this is what we have this is
[47:00] what we're journeying with and this is
[47:02] going to dictate to us where we settle
[47:05] now how often it is it people would say
[47:07] well my family was this way I'm this way
[47:10] I'm stubborn they're stubborn our last
[47:12] name should have been stubborn it's a
[47:14] trait of the family I guess this is just
[47:16] and so what will that that will cause
[47:17] someone to settle in the wrong
[47:19] inheritance right or there's always
[47:21] being lust bir or trouble or
[47:22] unforgiveness or whatever these family
[47:24] strains that come down but you see in
[47:26] the L of Liberty those things have to
[47:28] let go I mean those things do not define
[47:30] you the word of God defines you amen
[47:33] that your identity is not in your
[47:34] natural lineage anymore amen but it's in
[47:36] the word of God Amen so those things
[47:39] will keep people unfortunately on the
[47:41] wrong side of the Jordan but You' got to
[47:43] realize that no when God allocated the
[47:45] inheritance of the Bride in this day it
[47:47] wasn't on the wrong side of Jordan it
[47:49] wasn't just looking you know outward in
[47:51] but no it was that we would be in Christ
[47:53] amen in our Promised Land amen because
[47:56] we belong you to realize you belong in
[47:59] the Holy Ghost that's where you belong
[48:01] more than just coming to church you
[48:03] belong in Christ amen that's your
[48:05] inheritance this morning I'm here to
[48:07] read the will I mean the Lord Jesus died
[48:09] that we'd Reed promises and that's what
[48:11] preaching should do is actually say this
[48:13] is your portion it's not your portion to
[48:15] be in debt to sin it's not your portion
[48:17] to be burdened down with troubles no
[48:19] your portion is you'd walk at Liberty
[48:21] amen that you'd walk as Christ walked
[48:23] amen you'd walk in Freedom amen that you
[48:25] would not walk in so sure we'll go
[48:27] through troubles but as I've said
[48:29] probably no I don't think I've said it
[48:30] enough we'll go through the trouble am
[48:33] it's not your end they went through the
[48:36] Wilderness but the Wilderness wasn't
[48:37] their End Amen they went through some
[48:39] battles but the battle wasn't their End
[48:41] Amen it was actually living in the what
[48:43] God gave them to possess amen so God has
[48:46] told his bride in this day that we
[48:48] belong on the right side of Jordan amen
[48:50] with the resurrection remember the
[48:52] resurrection happened in the promised
[48:53] land Abraham buried Sarah in the
[48:55] Promised Land amen job was buried in
[48:58] that land Joseph commanded when they
[48:59] leave Egypt take my bones and put them
[49:02] in the land amen Jacob you know he could
[49:04] have had a great tomb down in Egypt but
[49:06] he said no bury me back in the promised
[49:08] land why because his inheritance he knew
[49:10] by his Birthright was I'm going to go on
[49:13] a resurrection one day where my redeemer
[49:15] liveth am me where my redeemer stands
[49:17] upon the Earth but it's in the land and
[49:19] that's why the prophet told us don't
[49:21] bury me in some church system bury me in
[49:23] Christ I mean don't bury me in a
[49:25] religion bury me in Christ amen cuz
[49:28] those which are in Christ God will take
[49:29] with him am mean you say well how do I
[49:32] get into Christ take God at his word see
[49:34] I think we complicate things way too
[49:36] much well how do you do that you repent
[49:38] you give your life to the Lord don't
[49:39] just come to church give your life to
[49:40] the Lord open your heart to him let him
[49:42] come and rearrange your life and be
[49:44] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[49:46] the remission of sin and you shall
[49:48] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost AM me
[49:50] what's that now your Resurrection ready
[49:53] hallu Hallelujah you got to realize
[49:55] that's your portion that's why God pul
[49:56] you and that's why God's called you am
[49:58] mean not just to sit in a Pew but to
[50:00] walk with him in his resurrection am
[50:02] mean because remember God's inheritance
[50:04] for us is himself like he told like he
[50:07] told Abraham I am your exceedingly great
[50:09] reward amen his reward wasn't just a
[50:11] promised land no it was God himself amen
[50:14] like brother Bram when he you know after
[50:15] he saw orl Roberts's state-ofthe-art
[50:17] building and he saw uh Tommy Osborne's
[50:20] headquarters you know he felt pretty
[50:22] small because they had great big
[50:23] multi-million dollar businesses going on
[50:26] and systems and regimes and he had a
[50:28] little trailer with a typewriter in the
[50:30] back of it that was his
[50:31] office you think about
[50:35] that here was the ministry God used to
[50:37] spare here to post world to Healing
[50:39] Revival and not just that but to call a
[50:41] bride to be reunited with the word of
[50:43] God and he had a c he had a trailer
[50:45] there in his backyard or wherever it was
[50:46] just with one typewriter and he felt so
[50:48] small saying Lord I guess you you you
[50:51] can't trust me with this kind of stuff
[50:53] that's why I don't have it but then he
[50:54] heard a voice said look up I'm your
[50:57] portion I'm your inheritance I'm your
[50:59] reward so those ones had their things on
[51:01] this Earth but I'm not looking for
[51:02] rewards on this side I'm looking for
[51:03] rewards on that side am me that my
[51:05] inheritance lays over amen over in
[51:08] glory hallelujah amen so our our our um
[51:13] promises are all in Christ Our
[51:15] inheritance is his amen see he's saying
[51:17] you belong in me I'm your exceedingly
[51:20] abundant portion I'm your inheritance
[51:22] I'm your resting place Hallelujah I am
[51:24] the resurrection and the life all that I
[51:26] am is yours amen our lord Jesus has set
[51:29] us free to enjoy every promise of the
[51:31] word amen not just some of them every
[51:34] promise amen we're at Liberty that our
[51:37] desires in him can be manifested we're
[51:40] at Liberty see we don't need to ask
[51:41] anyone permission can we we don't have
[51:43] to ask the devil we don't have to have
[51:45] to ask anyone can we receive all
[51:48] Promises of you know of God no because
[51:50] God says it's yours amen so whatever
[51:52] hindering spirit is coming against you
[51:54] you have a right to say get out of my
[51:55] way in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:59] hallelujah amen praise the Lord now so
[52:04] here was the Messiah
[52:06] himself he was telling everyone where
[52:09] they
[52:10] belonged but they said is this not
[52:12] Joseph's son are we still there you we
[52:13] there now brother Bram says as in
[52:15] recognizing your day and its message he
[52:17] says now I'm going to say something
[52:19] National Force put Israel in her
[52:20] Homeland National Force will put the
[52:23] church and the World Council of churches
[52:24] but the power of God will put the people
[52:26] people in The Bride the world forces
[52:29] this way the world forces that way but
[52:31] God forces upward the spirit of God
[52:33] which is the word of God my word is
[52:36] spirit and life will put the bride in
[52:37] her place cuz she'll recognize her
[52:39] position in the word then she's in
[52:41] Christ she will put her uh will put her
[52:44] in her place no National Force will do
[52:45] it but the National Force that drive
[52:48] Israel to the Homeland the national
[52:49] forces of the Council of churches will
[52:51] drive every organization into it but the
[52:53] power of God will raise the bride into
[52:55] Glory out of it amen so we got to
[52:58] realize now it's not National force that
[53:00] pushes the bride together it's not
[53:02] National Force that puts people in The
[53:05] Bride so it's not our national force of
[53:08] our intellect our ability that will push
[53:10] people into the bride that will actually
[53:12] cause people to get saved no it's the
[53:14] power of God Amen that will put the
[53:16] people in The Bride you got to read see
[53:18] friends our inheritance is a
[53:21] Rapture remember it doesn't matter where
[53:23] you came from what your past was that's
[53:25] irrelevant in God's economy am mean that
[53:27] don't matter am me the woman at the well
[53:28] had a bad past but that that had nothing
[53:31] to do with that c gen of God on the
[53:32] inside of him am mean Abraham had a lot
[53:35] of shady deals a lot of trouble in his
[53:36] life that didn't stop him being the
[53:37] father of faith I mean David committed
[53:40] adultery all these you know all the
[53:41] Believers down Through the Ages have
[53:43] done some nasty things but yet that
[53:45] wasn't who they were in God Amen so
[53:49] don't let your past you're at liberty to
[53:51] leave your past behind you're a perfect
[53:53] Liberty to leave your past behind and
[53:55] walk on with God hallah amen so it's so
[53:58] it's the power of God Amen that will put
[54:01] that will put the bride into
[54:04] Glory see cuz there's a law of Liberty
[54:07] see gravity is a
[54:09] law right you can fight against it all
[54:11] you want but it's a law yeah okay
[54:14] there's law of electricity there
[54:15] different laws and if you want something
[54:17] to work do it according to the law right
[54:20] there's like a law of lift right you
[54:22] know aerodynamics of a of a of an
[54:24] airplane wing the the right Brothers has
[54:26] finally got that law right and what they
[54:28] do it they lift it off the ground who's
[54:30] ever seen footage of
[54:31] that we could all make a better airplane
[54:34] than that you see in this day and age
[54:36] but what did they do they they didn't
[54:38] just haphazardly make the make the wings
[54:40] they designed it because they realized
[54:42] there lift just like when you you know
[54:44] you're driving along you put your hand
[54:45] out the window you tilt it up there's a
[54:47] lift that happens right right so so so
[54:50] they were so they took off they made a
[54:53] record of the first human powered flight
[54:55] by Tapp into that law of lift they
[54:57] didn't work against that law if you
[54:59] wanted to work against the law you would
[55:00] have added weight on the plane and you
[55:02] would have made the wings upside down
[55:04] because if the Wing's upside down then
[55:05] it'll actually cause you to be stuck to
[55:07] the ground there be the lift will
[55:08] actually be in a opposite side right so
[55:12] they work things according to the law so
[55:13] if we want to if we want to walk in in a
[55:17] greater Liberty we must walk according
[55:19] to the law of
[55:21] Liberty right now that law of Liberty is
[55:24] looking to see what God has said about
[55:25] you amen and focusing on that right it's
[55:29] really that simple this is not a
[55:31] complicated deal what God said about me
[55:33] is who I am amen right what he said
[55:36] about me not what my past says about me
[55:38] not what the accuser of the Brethren
[55:40] says about me not what others say about
[55:42] me not even what I know about me what he
[55:45] said about
[55:46] me amen hallelujah praise the Lord so
[55:50] now the power of God will put the people
[55:52] into the
[55:53] bride and that power will take amen the
[55:56] uh see as I said about those who try and
[56:00] make the 144,000 some Gentiles and
[56:02] displace the displace the um the Jews
[56:05] from their promise so the Devil comes
[56:07] along and tries to make us think that we
[56:11] are not fit to be the bride of Christ
[56:13] who's had that
[56:15] thought that's a real common thing isn't
[56:17] it because the devil's trying to push
[56:18] you off your inheritance you don't you
[56:19] don't belong here you're not worthy
[56:21] you've done this and remember he's the
[56:23] accuser of the Brethren if he's accusing
[56:25] you you should say praise God I'm part
[56:27] of the Brethren amen hallelujah why
[56:30] because he's accusing you right always
[56:32] use what he does against you against him
[56:34] just take vice versa like brother Braham
[56:36] said when he was trying to you know meet
[56:38] God there was a pull towards God he you
[56:40] know would you know thought he'd write
[56:41] God a letter and put it on going you
[56:43] know put it on a tree cuz God will walk
[56:44] there you know you know through the
[56:45] woods one day and read his letter then
[56:47] he said well you I'll go pray and he
[56:49] goes into the C and he's you know
[56:51] trying to say do I put my hands like
[56:52] this do I do this how am I meant to pray
[56:54] and you the devil came along and said
[56:56] well you've left it too late and then so
[56:58] he actually used that against and say
[57:00] well God if even if I'm too late anyway
[57:02] I'm going to tell you about it anyhow
[57:03] and had had a glorious conversion he met
[57:05] the Lord because what he used the
[57:07] accuser of the Brethren was trying to
[57:08] keep him down but the law of Liberty in
[57:11] his life allowed him to use out against
[57:12] the devil and he got what he
[57:15] needed praise God so he used the devil's
[57:17] accusations against him do the opposite
[57:21] amen amen so there is this of course
[57:23] there's an accusation that comes against
[57:25] us we are not worthy or fit Amen to be
[57:28] the bride of Christ right how could God
[57:31] ever work through a people like
[57:33] us but remember there's a law of
[57:36] Liberty right it's not about us it's
[57:38] about him you start to focus on you
[57:40] you're looking at the wrong person right
[57:42] so now as as as God would in the
[57:44] beginning make a bride for for for Adam
[57:48] forgot this here he says now and the
[57:50] Lord said it is not good that man should
[57:52] be alone I'll make him and help meet for
[57:54] him and out of the ground the Lord
[57:56] formed every beast of the field uh um
[57:58] and every foul of the year and brought
[57:59] them unto Adam to see what he would call
[58:01] them and whatsoever Adam called every
[58:03] living creature that was the name
[58:05] thereof and Adam gave names to all
[58:07] cattle and to the foul of the air and to
[58:08] every beast of the field but for Adam
[58:10] there was not found and help meat for
[58:13] him so Adam named everything but every
[58:16] time Adam saw an animal come up doesn't
[58:17] matter how how similar it looked to a
[58:19] human being remember because he saw the
[58:21] serpent right upright could talk reason
[58:24] all these things but there was nothing
[58:26] in him said this is part of me right
[58:28] this is not part of me right so so so he
[58:31] could not find the other part of himself
[58:34] and so now finally the Lord but then I
[58:36] guess the Lord needed him to realize
[58:38] this because really his the help meat
[58:41] for him was in him and had to come out
[58:44] and then so now the Lord God caused a
[58:45] deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[58:47] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[58:48] closed up the Flesh and stead thereof
[58:50] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[58:52] from man made he a woman and brought her
[58:54] unto the man and Adam said now this is
[58:57] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[58:59] she shall be called woman because she
[59:01] was taken out of man so when when Adam
[59:03] saw Eve he saw the feminine part of
[59:06] himself I see me walking towards me amen
[59:10] hallelujah this basically what he's
[59:11] saying cuz remember before the fall they
[59:12] were called Adam they had one name she
[59:15] was only called Eve the mother of all
[59:16] living after the fall right so so they
[59:19] they were called by the same name Adam
[59:21] Adam saw himself in femin feminine form
[59:25] walking towards him
[59:27] now a help meet is not a subordinate
[59:30] it's not someone who's less okay now
[59:33] this may be very Elementary for everyone
[59:35] and praise God if it is we're back in
[59:36] Sunday school but a help meat is not a
[59:39] something lower it's equal remember
[59:42] because under the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:44] the bride has been elevated be joint
[59:45] ears with Christ right we're not we're
[59:48] not subordinate I mean we're not I mean
[59:49] we're we're subordinate in the fact that
[59:51] we are under him but we're not less than
[59:53] him remember
[59:56] a a a marriage is between a man and a
[59:59] woman right that's what Believers
[1:00:01] believe right you don't have someone
[1:00:03] Marrying an animal you don't have like
[1:00:06] marries
[1:00:08] like amen maybe Sisters You may look at
[1:00:11] your husband say are you sure but you
[1:00:12] know like Mary's like right
[1:00:18] amen we'll get there one day I think
[1:00:20] anyway but you see so this help meet as
[1:00:25] the Bible say this meat for him is
[1:00:26] actually one word and it means the part
[1:00:29] opposite especially a counterpart or a
[1:00:31] mate now that word counterpart I love
[1:00:34] this he says a thing that fits
[1:00:37] perfectly amen just it's so it's not
[1:00:39] something that doesn't fit we got to
[1:00:40] realize we fit with the word I mean when
[1:00:43] you heard this message something in you
[1:00:44] said this is home this is me something
[1:00:48] in you says I fit with this this this
[1:00:50] this Rings true you know I was in I was
[1:00:53] in different D you know I I had to go to
[1:00:56] Presbyterian boarding school Anglican
[1:00:57] boarding school went to uh Pentecostal
[1:01:00] Church Charismatic Church nothing seemed
[1:01:01] to fit but when I heard that voice good
[1:01:05] evening friends that word spoke to me
[1:01:07] like no nothing else ever has and will I
[1:01:10] mean why because I'm going to realize I
[1:01:12] fit with this see many times we think we
[1:01:15] just stumble into this or well my
[1:01:16] parents were raised in this or my
[1:01:18] grandparents were in this and this is
[1:01:19] just a family thing we do but there
[1:01:21] comes a season I pray now is Amen to all
[1:01:23] of us that it becomes a personal
[1:01:25] relationship with Jesus Christ am mean
[1:01:27] it's not your mother's experience your
[1:01:29] dad's experience your grandparents
[1:01:30] experience or or the culture that you
[1:01:32] find yourself raising no it's you and
[1:01:34] God Amen so you begin to realize that
[1:01:37] you fit the
[1:01:38] word amen now I'm not talking about your
[1:01:41] natural ability there's a there's a seed
[1:01:43] in you right am mean that fits there's a
[1:01:45] Harmony what a Harmony that is between
[1:01:47] the bride and the bridegroom Christ the
[1:01:48] word and is bride am mean a Harmony of
[1:01:50] love and faith working together
[1:01:54] Hallelujah am mean it's something that
[1:01:56] completes it's a compliment this is a
[1:01:58] help meet I mean something that
[1:02:00] completes the other half so so Eve
[1:02:02] completed Adam right Eve without Adam
[1:02:05] was5 of a
[1:02:07] person right so so they completed they
[1:02:10] complimented one another so what he now
[1:02:13] lacked she had and what she lacked he
[1:02:15] had they were complimentary are we all
[1:02:17] here today are we all okay you say not
[1:02:19] my spouse you need a revelation all
[1:02:22] right you need a revelation no we
[1:02:23] compliment one another well we have
[1:02:25] different um personalities and different
[1:02:27] likes and different things yeah but you
[1:02:29] when you bring both together praise God
[1:02:32] yeah there's a saying Opposites Attract
[1:02:34] and that's true you say we're very
[1:02:35] similar that's fine as well right but
[1:02:38] you see you compliment one another God
[1:02:40] brought you together you said we made
[1:02:42] out in the world God was guiding your
[1:02:44] life before you even knew it he was with
[1:02:46] you the whole time amen he never he
[1:02:48] always had his hand upon your life I
[1:02:50] mean didn't matter what you were going
[1:02:51] through the struggles the troubles the
[1:02:53] fog whatever God had his hand upon your
[1:02:55] life because he was determined they're
[1:02:57] going to hear my law of Liberty in their
[1:02:58] season they're going to walk with me
[1:03:00] they're going to know me in the power of
[1:03:01] my resurrection and that's it and Satan
[1:03:03] you've got to let go of them they have
[1:03:05] no right you have no right to hold them
[1:03:06] back anymore there's a law that's been
[1:03:08] declared am mean there's a gospel
[1:03:10] trumpet that's been blown amen that
[1:03:12] there's a law of Liberty that must be
[1:03:14] manifested Hallelujah that's why if you
[1:03:16] look at Rahab now Rahab was in was in um
[1:03:19] she was in Jericho right amen but now
[1:03:22] when God formed Rahab he did not see a
[1:03:25] hot in Jer sealed up in a gentile system
[1:03:28] he saw a part of himself he saw the
[1:03:30] lineage of Jesus Christ passing through
[1:03:32] her body amen she that's how she was
[1:03:36] seen in the mind of God so now now now
[1:03:39] to me you I love it how how Joshua they
[1:03:41] had to March around the city but then on
[1:03:43] the 13th
[1:03:45] time however many time it was on the
[1:03:48] seventh day they went seven times right
[1:03:51] all right I remember Jimmy's um uh when
[1:03:53] he preached on that put the question up
[1:03:55] had to think about that anyway you see
[1:03:57] there's a reason they blew the trumpets
[1:03:59] and they shouted to cause the walls to
[1:04:02] come down because through that trumpet
[1:04:04] was a jubilee cry a jubilee sound I mean
[1:04:08] there was a declaration now that Liberty
[1:04:11] a law of Liberty was now spoken into
[1:04:14] Jericho amen so the so so there was
[1:04:16] Rahab her pass bound her down you know
[1:04:19] her her City bound her down there was a
[1:04:21] death sentence over the whole place but
[1:04:23] yet she found Grace in the sight of of
[1:04:26] God because she realized if judgment was
[1:04:28] coming Mercy was coming too amen and
[1:04:31] that's what happened with you and I we
[1:04:32] see the world falling apart but we
[1:04:34] realize that there's judgment coming
[1:04:35] there's got to be Mercy somewhere
[1:04:37] because our God is rich in Mercy amen
[1:04:40] he's rich in Mercy this morning amen so
[1:04:42] when she when those trumpets were
[1:04:44] blowing what happened is that law of
[1:04:45] Liberty caused every obstacle in rahab's
[1:04:49] life to be destroyed amen it caused the
[1:04:51] walls to come down am mean it caused it
[1:04:54] caused every hindrance to come down and
[1:04:56] it caused her past to
[1:05:00] die why because every man that she ever
[1:05:02] you know slept with died when that City
[1:05:05] was destroyed her past was killed am
[1:05:07] mean so then when finally the day that
[1:05:09] she uh was married into Israel and maybe
[1:05:12] the rabbi don't know if they do if they
[1:05:13] stand up and say if there if there's
[1:05:15] anyone
[1:05:16] here who who who who who can testify
[1:05:20] against this Union stopping speak up and
[1:05:24] maybe maybe there'll be just some little
[1:05:26] uh Israelite princess would get up
[1:05:28] because they were going to marry um
[1:05:30] Salomon you here's a prince of Judah
[1:05:31] this is the one that Rahab married and
[1:05:33] maybe you they thought no I'm going to
[1:05:34] put an end to this cuz he's meant to be
[1:05:36] mine maybe she stood up maybe someone
[1:05:38] stood up and said you have no right to
[1:05:40] marry this Gentile and then maybe you
[1:05:42] know Solomon would have said okay you
[1:05:45] you say she did these things where's the
[1:05:48] witnesses you'd hear a pin drop cuz God
[1:05:51] takes care of everything he takes care
[1:05:54] of your past see she was now at Liberty
[1:05:56] the law of Liberty had come into her
[1:05:58] life cuz she was a citizen of Israel am
[1:06:02] mean now how much more you and I friends
[1:06:03] we've heard the a a word of Liberty amen
[1:06:07] you got to realize now which voice you
[1:06:09] going to listen to which voice you going
[1:06:11] to Panda to the voice of Liberty or you
[1:06:14] going to listen to that the voice of the
[1:06:17] devil holding you down so you're going
[1:06:19] to realize if something's making you
[1:06:20] reason away following the word that's
[1:06:22] not God it's not God causing you to
[1:06:25] reason away the word of God that's not
[1:06:27] the law of Liberty speaking the law of
[1:06:29] Liberty wants you to fulfill his word
[1:06:32] amen he wants you so for example people
[1:06:34] wrestle about being baptized or not what
[1:06:37] is why is there that wrestling because
[1:06:38] the devil says no I don't want you to
[1:06:40] actually come under the full law of
[1:06:42] Liberty to be identified in the word you
[1:06:44] see but God's calling you come amen what
[1:06:47] does hinder thee it's not
[1:06:51] God Amen prise the lord it's not God
[1:06:55] Amen
[1:06:56] praise the Lord so so it's something
[1:06:58] that compliments we haven't gone off the
[1:07:00] slide yet amen they are one remarkably
[1:07:02] similar to another amen a counterpart to
[1:07:05] help me they're remarkably similar now
[1:07:08] we may we all look different God is a
[1:07:10] god of variety I say thank God for that
[1:07:13] amen thank God you're not all like me
[1:07:15] praise God hallelujah I'm happy about
[1:07:18] that and you can say Amen too that's
[1:07:19] fine amen but you see now see but but
[1:07:22] but we are remarkably similar to Christ
[1:07:25] why because there's something in us that
[1:07:27] actually believes his word see brother
[1:07:29] bam said when you know before there sun
[1:07:30] moon and stars he said let there be and
[1:07:33] he believed his own word so he had faith
[1:07:36] in what was spoken right and then now
[1:07:38] what does every believer do they have
[1:07:40] faith in the word spoken amen they have
[1:07:42] faith in the word ultimately this is
[1:07:45] this is what makes us Believers we take
[1:07:46] God at his word above our feelings our
[1:07:49] whatever whatever whatever we take God
[1:07:51] in his word we believe his word amen so
[1:07:54] so we are remarkable
[1:07:57] similar praise the Lord you know they
[1:08:00] see you know it's like when Jesus was
[1:08:02] here you know the days of his flesh and
[1:08:04] he would ask his disciples in Mark 16
[1:08:06] who do men say that I am and they said
[1:08:08] you're Jer you John the Baptist or
[1:08:10] Jeremiah or one of the prophets because
[1:08:12] what they saw Jesus do was remarkably
[1:08:14] similar aming to what the prophets did
[1:08:17] now we know the reason for that is
[1:08:18] because because Jesus Christ was the
[1:08:20] fullness of the god here bodly right he
[1:08:22] was God unlimited all that God was was
[1:08:24] in Christ right but upon the prophets
[1:08:27] was was was God in measure so it's like
[1:08:29] a you know like light you have a
[1:08:31] three-sided prism you shine light
[1:08:33] through it you know the white light goes
[1:08:35] in that comes out red and yellow orange
[1:08:37] green and all those things right so the
[1:08:39] green is not the fullness of the light
[1:08:40] but it's part of the light same with the
[1:08:42] blue the yellow Indigo whatever it is
[1:08:44] right but when you put those back all
[1:08:46] together you get white light again you
[1:08:47] get the fullness of the light so when so
[1:08:49] when the prophets were here it was God
[1:08:51] in portion amen right but now Christ was
[1:08:54] the fullness of all the prophets were
[1:08:56] amen cuz he was the full word right so
[1:08:58] now when they saw Jesus do certain
[1:09:00] things they say that's like Jeremiah
[1:09:02] he's a weeping prophet that's like Moses
[1:09:05] he did this this is like John the
[1:09:06] Baptist you know they could see what
[1:09:08] what the previous prophets did and
[1:09:10] that's sort in his life why because he
[1:09:11] was remarkably similar why because the
[1:09:15] same life was in him now I pray to God
[1:09:17] that when you know when when when you
[1:09:20] roll out of bed in the morning a shutter
[1:09:22] goes through hell like that through
[1:09:25] every imp through every devil there's a
[1:09:27] shutter goes through them saying they're
[1:09:29] awake again they're awake again because
[1:09:31] when they look at you they see something
[1:09:33] that even humans don't see I mean they
[1:09:36] see the life of God I mean they see
[1:09:38] there's a fire the pillar of fire is
[1:09:39] burning Veil behind human skins once
[1:09:42] again and so when they look at you they
[1:09:44] see something that is that is to them
[1:09:46] terrifyingly familiar to what they've
[1:09:49] seen in past ages amen so when God when
[1:09:52] when Michael and his angels fought
[1:09:54] against his dragon you know in his
[1:09:55] angels in Revelations 12 before the
[1:09:57] foundation of the world Amen that look
[1:09:59] in Michael's eyes is now in you amen
[1:10:03] that look was in Noah's eyes it was in
[1:10:05] moses' eyes in John the Baptist's eyes I
[1:10:07] it was in every believer's eyes was that
[1:10:09] same look cuz God was veiled in them I
[1:10:11] mean God was living himself out of them
[1:10:13] and the same thing of course in the life
[1:10:15] of our Lord Jesus and then of course in
[1:10:17] the upper room that same God came down
[1:10:19] and the look that was in the disciples
[1:10:20] eyes was now different they looked the
[1:10:23] same the house looked the same but
[1:10:24] there's a Burning Flame the lights
[1:10:26] turned on Hallelujah I pray the lights
[1:10:28] turn on Amen not looking here in
[1:10:31] particular but I pray the lights turn on
[1:10:33] right that there's now there's that
[1:10:34] burning Eternal Flame is now burning
[1:10:36] amen so so whenever the devil I pray
[1:10:38] that when the devil sees you he sees
[1:10:40] that life and he says there they are
[1:10:42] remarkably similar am what the first
[1:10:45] church was and what the end time bride
[1:10:47] is they say they are remarkably similar
[1:10:50] one to another Hallelujah am mean one
[1:10:54] having the same functional
[1:10:55] characteristics as another it's
[1:10:57] counterpart amen what's the same
[1:10:59] function in my name they shall cast out
[1:11:02] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:11:04] they'll take up any deadly thing that
[1:11:05] shall not harm them they'll Che on
[1:11:07] serpents amen they will they will the
[1:11:10] gospel will be manifested in power same
[1:11:14] function what is the function of the
[1:11:15] church that God will come and dwell in
[1:11:17] us and fulfill his plan upon the Earth
[1:11:20] remember he purchased everyone that day
[1:11:21] on Calvary right amen but he's going to
[1:11:24] live through us that Redemption would
[1:11:25] come through the body to everyone around
[1:11:28] us we got to realize I've got a function
[1:11:30] I've got a purpose amen I'm not here
[1:11:32] just filling up time amen but I've got a
[1:11:34] function what is that to worship and
[1:11:36] praise God in every circumstance Amen to
[1:11:39] live for him am me because that's the
[1:11:41] law of Liberty the law of Liberty
[1:11:43] dictates to you that your worship is not
[1:11:47] meant to be dictated to by
[1:11:49] circumstance amen trouble comes in
[1:11:51] you're at liberty to praise God hardship
[1:11:53] comes in you're at liberty to praise God
[1:11:55] God you don't know the way forward
[1:11:56] you're at liberty to praise God that is
[1:11:59] not that is not what's happening in your
[1:12:00] life controls no it's the law of Liberty
[1:12:03] it's like Caleb and Joshua they were
[1:12:05] under the law of Liberty they came to
[1:12:07] trouble they didn't murmur like the rest
[1:12:09] because their walk with God wasn't based
[1:12:11] on what God was doing it was or where
[1:12:13] God was leading them through it was
[1:12:14] based on who God was amen so they went
[1:12:18] there they were praising God in the
[1:12:19] desert praising God going through Jordan
[1:12:22] praising God on the other side praising
[1:12:23] God why because they were under the law
[1:12:25] of Liberty they knew that their
[1:12:27] citizenship was not based on natural
[1:12:29] Israel it was in
[1:12:31] heaven praise
[1:12:34] God Amen you see the life of God see the
[1:12:38] devil I pray shutters at the thought of
[1:12:39] you because he thought he snuffed out
[1:12:42] the life of God long ago but he can't do
[1:12:43] it amen the life of God can never be
[1:12:46] snuff snuffed
[1:12:47] out praise God Amen even as brother
[1:12:51] Brown would preach the statue of a
[1:12:52] perfect man but he didn't call it that
[1:12:54] do you know that
[1:12:55] he said this morning want to speak on
[1:12:57] the subject or teach rather of building
[1:12:59] the living Tabernacle building the
[1:13:01] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:13:03] Dwelling Place the perfect
[1:13:06] man amen that's what he's preaching
[1:13:09] right so the and and and this is this is
[1:13:11] what happens is when the Living God
[1:13:13] comes into you and I then what happens
[1:13:15] is we are a help meat for
[1:13:17] him thank you Lord amen as he you know
[1:13:20] that that when when people see us they
[1:13:22] should see his character on display more
[1:13:25] than anything more than Miracles more
[1:13:28] than signs and wonders they should see
[1:13:29] the characteristics of the word the
[1:13:31] nature of Christ in you and I living
[1:13:34] out amen you say
[1:13:36] well the power of God will put you in
[1:13:39] that position amen because it says in
[1:13:41] Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he did
[1:13:43] also predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:13:45] image of his son that he might be the
[1:13:47] firstborn among many Brethren praise God
[1:13:51] remember that's your law of Liberty got
[1:13:53] to look into that say Lord you predes me
[1:13:55] to be conformed to the image of your son
[1:13:57] which is the word of God Amen praise the
[1:14:01] Lord
[1:14:02] now let's go here because we got to
[1:14:05] realize see the devil wants to try and
[1:14:07] push us down that we are you know we are
[1:14:09] nothing no God has made us something we
[1:14:12] may be a bunch of nothings but God has
[1:14:14] made us something right what is that
[1:14:16] something jewels in his crown love gifts
[1:14:19] to Christ brother B says many times when
[1:14:20] people come forward and give their lives
[1:14:22] he says Lord I present them to you as
[1:14:24] love gifts
[1:14:25] amen you say I've got no value you're a
[1:14:27] love gift and God knows how to give the
[1:14:30] best
[1:14:31] gifts amen he's The Ultimate Gift Giver
[1:14:35] he's now brother R would say now the
[1:14:36] greatest thing that God could give man
[1:14:38] outside of Salvation was a wife aen that
[1:14:41] she was to comfort him help him to bless
[1:14:43] him to console him to be a real
[1:14:45] companion to him amen praise God now
[1:14:50] this is the same now if you take it in
[1:14:51] the spiritual sense where where you know
[1:14:54] the greatest thing that God could give
[1:14:56] Christ if I put it that way is a
[1:14:58] bride that's you and I you're under the
[1:15:01] law of Liberty to become
[1:15:03] this
[1:15:05] amen praise the Lord but you got to see
[1:15:07] now we going to look into this where you
[1:15:10] say well what is now driving what's
[1:15:13] motivating my life cuz these two laws CU
[1:15:16] remember we are still in these bodies
[1:15:18] right we these bodies need changing and
[1:15:22] more just because they're getting old
[1:15:24] yep remember you get a certain point
[1:15:25] it's all
[1:15:27] downhill right it's not the sense that
[1:15:30] these bodies get old we want them change
[1:15:31] it's because of the nature the sin
[1:15:33] nature that's in this flesh right the
[1:15:36] wrestling match that we go through every
[1:15:38] day amen because this thing is is bound
[1:15:41] by a chain of circumstance which is the
[1:15:43] holy ghost in your life right but it's
[1:15:45] rather you feed the animal or not who do
[1:15:48] you who do you lean
[1:15:49] to amen because the remember the law of
[1:15:52] Liberty is greater than the law of sin
[1:15:53] and death yeah amen amen but you see now
[1:15:56] you got to look at now what so if we go
[1:15:59] here now so James would ask the question
[1:16:00] who is a wise man and endured with
[1:16:02] knowled endued with knowledge among you
[1:16:04] let him show out of um of a good
[1:16:07] conversation with his works with
[1:16:08] meekness of wisdom but if you have
[1:16:10] bitter envying and strife in your hearts
[1:16:12] Glory not and lie not against the truth
[1:16:15] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[1:16:17] but is Earthly cental and devilish I'll
[1:16:19] say it is not the law of
[1:16:21] Liberty right if you got striving and
[1:16:24] envy and bitterness and stuff no that is
[1:16:26] not the law you should be living under
[1:16:29] amen all with me now amen for where envy
[1:16:32] and strife is there is confusion in
[1:16:33] every evil work but the wisdom that is
[1:16:35] from above is first pure then Peaceable
[1:16:38] gentle easy to be intreated full of
[1:16:39] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[1:16:42] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[1:16:45] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:16:47] that make peace so now we have a choice
[1:16:50] now if the wisdom in our hearts is
[1:16:51] strife and envy and you got to realize
[1:16:53] that is not the law of Liberty
[1:16:56] right remember we're called to live out
[1:16:58] I'm just going to repeat this because
[1:16:59] you realize what law am I under what
[1:17:01] rights remember a law brings rights
[1:17:03] right so what rights do you have amen
[1:17:06] under the law of Liberty you have a
[1:17:08] right to walk with God that his life and
[1:17:11] nature will live out of you right amen
[1:17:14] but then you can be still a slave and
[1:17:16] then you can let your own natural carnal
[1:17:18] life live out but I think no we need to
[1:17:20] look at now what is what is motivating
[1:17:22] us is it strife and envy and all these
[1:17:24] things that say that's not the law of
[1:17:26] Liberty amen we got to realize now that
[1:17:28] that you say well this character that
[1:17:32] that that that this Liberty should
[1:17:33] produce remember it's a victory
[1:17:36] character is a victory right so this law
[1:17:38] of Liberty just because we live under
[1:17:40] this law doesn't mean we don't have an
[1:17:42] opposition I mean doesn't mean the devil
[1:17:44] quits and gives up says well I guess I
[1:17:46] just can't win no he's going to he's
[1:17:48] going to resist you as much as he can
[1:17:50] right you got to realize you're
[1:17:52] Victorious amen nothing can stop you
[1:17:55] am mean nothing can stop you you can
[1:17:57] press on am mean so brother Bram says
[1:17:59] that now the reason for this is so so
[1:18:01] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:18:02] reign with him we have to suffer to
[1:18:04] Reign the reason for this is that
[1:18:05] character simply never uh is never made
[1:18:08] without suffering character is a victory
[1:18:09] and not a gift a man without character
[1:18:12] can't Reign because power apart from
[1:18:13] character is satanic but Power with
[1:18:16] character is fit to rule am mean so this
[1:18:18] is why now character is a victory it's
[1:18:20] not a gift that means you got to you
[1:18:22] have to fight you've got to over come
[1:18:25] something for that character to come
[1:18:26] into your life now what is that thing
[1:18:28] you've got to overcome is actually your
[1:18:29] first birth am me it's your first birth
[1:18:32] this own nature that you inherited you
[1:18:34] say well I don't like this nature I have
[1:18:36] or none of us like the nature we're born
[1:18:39] with right it's all very much a lord
[1:18:42] changes thing right but that doesn't
[1:18:45] mean we focus on it we focus on the law
[1:18:47] of Liberty right because if you keep
[1:18:49] looking at yourself you're not looking
[1:18:51] at the law of Liberty you got to look
[1:18:52] into the word of God now brother has
[1:18:55] asked a question a couple of places how
[1:18:56] do you overcome a
[1:18:58] complex cuz we unfortunately we inherit
[1:19:01] them or we Reed him during life's
[1:19:03] journey so so he asked the question now
[1:19:06] how how do you overcome this now he
[1:19:08] would say this in God being uh
[1:19:09] misunderstood sorry I don't have it up
[1:19:11] here but he says now he says my brother
[1:19:14] or my Christian brother or sister
[1:19:15] whoever it may be most times when you
[1:19:17] find people uh it's got stubborn Spirits
[1:19:19] it's usually a complex that causes this
[1:19:22] either they have inherited it from
[1:19:23] mother father uncle aunt grandmother
[1:19:25] grandfather somebody like that and if
[1:19:27] you'll trace it back down through your
[1:19:28] life you'll find it see I've taken this
[1:19:31] by experience under discernment because
[1:19:33] I've met cases on the platform thousands
[1:19:34] of those who have had that Spirit and
[1:19:36] the first thing you'd know I'd chase
[1:19:38] that Spirit right back by discernment
[1:19:40] and find out there was a granddaddy or
[1:19:41] grandmother that was somebody else bound
[1:19:44] uh back down there and you inherited
[1:19:46] that by Nature he said well do I need to
[1:19:49] realize where this thing came from no
[1:19:51] you just need to realize it's not yours
[1:19:53] your it is not your portion it's not
[1:19:55] part of the law of Liberty that's the
[1:19:57] main thing cuz many people say well I've
[1:19:58] got to retrace everything in my life and
[1:20:00] then finally I can untangle it no you've
[1:20:02] just going to look into the law of
[1:20:03] Liberty and realize it's not part of
[1:20:06] that law and if you're living under that
[1:20:08] law of Liberty you can say you can walk
[1:20:10] on and say Lord this is not my portion
[1:20:12] you did not die that I would live in
[1:20:14] this thing amen but you died you died
[1:20:16] that I would live in you and joy and
[1:20:18] peace and love and everything amen and
[1:20:21] then so he says now when you feel that
[1:20:22] you've got a stubborn spirit lay the
[1:20:25] thing on the Altar and believe God and
[1:20:27] believe God the thing is dead and you'll
[1:20:29] never have to have it no more and go on
[1:20:31] and don't even pay any attention to it
[1:20:32] no more and the thing is it'll leave you
[1:20:35] see if you give it attention it'll stay
[1:20:38] see the devil wants your
[1:20:40] attention amen that's what he wants he
[1:20:42] wants your focus this is why people you
[1:20:44] see spirits that just run rampant on
[1:20:46] social media and all these things
[1:20:48] because they want the world's
[1:20:50] attention right sure there should be
[1:20:52] free speech whatever whatever but but
[1:20:54] you know the thing a thing becomes
[1:20:56] greater if its attention is it's got
[1:20:59] your attention right Goliath like
[1:21:02] brother chrisan at Camp he wasn't
[1:21:04] actually that big but his height and
[1:21:06] stature got the people's attention and
[1:21:08] that's what caused him to come under
[1:21:10] that fear and be intimidated by this
[1:21:11] thing but if they realize no my Covenant
[1:21:14] with God the law of Liberty is greater
[1:21:16] than that giant or that guy he's going
[1:21:19] there wouldn't have been a 40 40-day
[1:21:22] pause going on there the stalemate says
[1:21:24] resist the devil he'll flee from you
[1:21:26] that's get away quickly so that would be
[1:21:29] my advice how to overcome it we overcome
[1:21:31] the Devil by faith and that's what we
[1:21:32] overcome all evil is by faith then he's
[1:21:35] asked the same question about a complex
[1:21:37] and um this is questions ansers 1964 he
[1:21:40] said take exactly the opposite if you're
[1:21:43] always wanting your way and that one
[1:21:45] little brat that wants to always have
[1:21:47] everything your way turn right back
[1:21:49] around and give everything you've got
[1:21:50] the other way this is how you overcome
[1:21:53] see this is how you re this is how you
[1:21:55] let the law of Liberty govern your life
[1:21:58] you say I got a complex I just want
[1:22:00] everything I'm so selfish and you
[1:22:01] realize that what do you do remember
[1:22:03] character is a victory not a gift that's
[1:22:05] right right so you got to take the
[1:22:06] opposite instead of wanting it all your
[1:22:09] own way let others have their way I
[1:22:11] don't want to do it that way well let
[1:22:14] them do it that way
[1:22:16] right amen it's really not complicated
[1:22:20] it's not even a seven step problem thing
[1:22:22] it's just no do the opposite amen if
[1:22:24] you're selfish you want to hold
[1:22:26] everything then start giving away all
[1:22:28] you've got see just do the vice versa
[1:22:30] that's the way to overcome anything it's
[1:22:32] an
[1:22:33] antidote beautiful over amen you are
[1:22:37] self-centered be be be focused on other
[1:22:40] people amen you you you feel sorry for
[1:22:42] yourself well be loving to other people
[1:22:46] amen just do the opposite it's the
[1:22:48] antidote
[1:22:50] amen praise the Lord now where we going
[1:22:52] with now
[1:22:55] you see there's um and we're running out
[1:22:57] of time let's let's just let's just be
[1:22:59] quick here now we're living under a
[1:23:03] promise right of this law of
[1:23:06] Liberty now there's always a struggle
[1:23:09] that we have to overcome in this age
[1:23:12] because there's a law because the this
[1:23:15] this age is such a deceiving age that
[1:23:19] you know of lukewarmness where people
[1:23:20] think they're fine just coming to church
[1:23:23] which is it's good to come to church we
[1:23:24] must come to church we must assemble
[1:23:25] ourselves together but God never
[1:23:27] intended us to to to just be part of a
[1:23:30] group he wants you he wants to know you
[1:23:33] he wants to walk in you he wants to be
[1:23:34] your personal God I mean not just a
[1:23:36] collective God never deals with the
[1:23:38] Gentiles as always individuals right so
[1:23:41] now these so he but but he even said in
[1:23:43] this you know he called it worldly
[1:23:46] things about I'll just be a good church
[1:23:47] member I'll be a good man a good woman I
[1:23:49] do this see he says no it's but he that
[1:23:52] overcometh he that overcometh all those
[1:23:53] worldly things of this age so just to be
[1:23:56] to to to reason it away and say well I'm
[1:23:58] a good person that's actually not the
[1:24:00] law of Liberty now the law of Liberty is
[1:24:03] when you come into Christ amen where he
[1:24:05] changes you transforms your life amen
[1:24:08] now we
[1:24:09] are so I'm just trying to find where to
[1:24:11] where to pull over
[1:24:15] now amen now the Apostle Paul if you
[1:24:18] read the book of
[1:24:20] Galatians he would tell them that they
[1:24:23] are not they are not not even children
[1:24:25] just of the natural Jerusalem and that
[1:24:28] they are they are as as um he would
[1:24:30] contrast you know isma and Isaac and
[1:24:34] he'd say that the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:24:37] is not the child of the Bond woman right
[1:24:40] so we're not being born we've not been
[1:24:43] uh come into this world by uh I mean
[1:24:45] sorry into Christ to be in bondage again
[1:24:47] we have a different inheritance okay so
[1:24:50] he says now tell me if ye that desire to
[1:24:52] be under the law do you not hear the law
[1:24:54] it's written that Abraham had two sons
[1:24:56] one by a bondmaid one by a free woman
[1:24:59] but he who um who was of the Bond woman
[1:25:01] was born after the flesh but he of the
[1:25:03] free woman was by promise which things
[1:25:05] are an allegory for for these are the
[1:25:08] two covenants one uh from Mount Si that
[1:25:10] gendereth to bondage which is AA and for
[1:25:13] this AA is Mount Si in Arabia and anth
[1:25:15] to Jerusalem which now is is in bondage
[1:25:18] with the children but the but Jerusalem
[1:25:20] which is above is free which is the
[1:25:22] mother of us um of us all for it is
[1:25:24] written Rejoice thou Baron that beareth
[1:25:26] not break forth and cry thou that
[1:25:28] travaileth not for the desolate hath
[1:25:30] many more children that that she that
[1:25:32] had a husband now we Brethren as Isaac
[1:25:34] was are children of promise but as then
[1:25:37] he that was born after the flesh
[1:25:39] persecuted him that is born after the
[1:25:41] spirit even so is now nevertheless what
[1:25:43] sayith the scripture cast out the Bond
[1:25:45] woman and her son for the son of the
[1:25:47] Bond woman hath not be ear with the son
[1:25:50] of the free woman so then Brethren we're
[1:25:52] not children of the born woman but of
[1:25:54] the free am amen now that woman that
[1:25:57] that free woman is the same word that we
[1:25:59] spoke about Liberty one who is a citizen
[1:26:02] am mean ones who can one who can go free
[1:26:05] amen now but you notice here where it
[1:26:07] says that that Isaac was the child of
[1:26:09] promise now but but but ishma was after
[1:26:11] the flesh you'd say well but they were
[1:26:13] both born naturally yes so they both
[1:26:16] You' say born after the flesh but God
[1:26:18] wasn't looking at how they came to the
[1:26:20] Earth he was looking at the promise they
[1:26:22] were born under now you to realize you
[1:26:24] were born under the law of liberty
[1:26:27] before you ever came to the Earth God
[1:26:29] when he when he thought of that law of
[1:26:31] Liberty of you walking free as a son or
[1:26:33] daughter of God walking in his promises
[1:26:35] having preeminence over the devil and
[1:26:36] everything walking in Victory he thought
[1:26:38] of you amen when he thought of that
[1:26:40] promise he thought of you amen just like
[1:26:42] when before Isaac was born amen he said
[1:26:45] no he's a child of promise that through
[1:26:47] him Jesus Christ is the the Messiah is
[1:26:49] going to come to the Earth amen so that
[1:26:51] word promis now means an announcement it
[1:26:53] means a promise it means a you know a a
[1:26:56] promis good or a blessing amen so Isaac
[1:26:59] was a was was a promised good or
[1:27:02] blessing he was he was a child of an
[1:27:04] announcement now friends we have an
[1:27:06] incredible announcement in this day amen
[1:27:08] we've got an incredible announcement
[1:27:09] amen of a you know I'm just going to
[1:27:12] maybe finish with these few statements
[1:27:13] you know but we we live under incredible
[1:27:16] promise of a Rapture in this day amen
[1:27:18] where where they which are alive and
[1:27:20] remain shall not uh hinder those which
[1:27:22] are asleep and you know the dead in
[1:27:23] Christ
[1:27:24] there's the people who are alive and
[1:27:26] remain that will walk from this world to
[1:27:28] the next World and that is the ultimate
[1:27:30] end of the the culmination of the law of
[1:27:33] Liberty and it's not just our soul
[1:27:35] becomes free from sin now faith comes in
[1:27:37] and Faith governs our life but this body
[1:27:39] that so wrestles against us is changed
[1:27:42] amen our human spirit is changed amen
[1:27:45] that we step into a glorified body amen
[1:27:48] that is the greatest that is the
[1:27:50] culmination of the law of Liberty so as
[1:27:52] you walk in Christ now you just keep
[1:27:54] walking and your body will be changed
[1:27:56] amen cuz you're living under that
[1:27:58] law Hallelujah so we're living under
[1:28:01] that promise amen that we are children
[1:28:02] of the promise of the Rapture Lord
[1:28:05] praise the Lord amen if you look at you
[1:28:09] know even if you look at the promises
[1:28:11] that you know that you know as Paul
[1:28:13] would say until the fullness of the
[1:28:14] Gentiles come in when did what were the
[1:28:16] Gentiles God was thinking of you and I
[1:28:19] amen I'll s Elijah the prophet for the
[1:28:21] great and Dreadful day of the Lord he'll
[1:28:22] turn the hearts of the I just got the
[1:28:24] the yellow here the hearts of the
[1:28:25] children to their fathers those He he'll
[1:28:26] turn people's hearts back to the
[1:28:28] original Faith who was born under that
[1:28:30] promise amen God will send who me you
[1:28:34] Elijah the prophet what do that that
[1:28:35] word that law of Liberty that's preached
[1:28:38] will turn us back to the original
[1:28:40] Faith
[1:28:42] hallelujah amen I'm just going to I'm
[1:28:44] just going to um come down to the last
[1:28:46] bit here you say well what can I
[1:28:50] do to
[1:28:52] overcome as I said about complex do vice
[1:28:54] versa but what are you focusing on what
[1:28:58] are you focusing on see the devil wants
[1:29:00] you to look one way God wants you to
[1:29:02] look the other way right one is the law
[1:29:05] of Liberty one is the law of bondage and
[1:29:07] slavery to your past to your problems to
[1:29:10] your situation to whatever but one is
[1:29:13] the law of Liberty that God wants to Li
[1:29:16] cause you to live in that law that no
[1:29:18] matter what's happening in your life you
[1:29:19] say no I'm unrestrained by these things
[1:29:23] this will not dictate to me how I praise
[1:29:26] God remember because we worship God not
[1:29:28] based on circumstance we worship Him
[1:29:29] based on who he
[1:29:32] is amen he says this now for if any be
[1:29:34] hear of the word and not do he is like
[1:29:36] unto a man beholding his natural face in
[1:29:38] a glass for he beholdeth himself and
[1:29:40] Goth his way and straight away forget
[1:29:42] what manner of man he is but whosoever
[1:29:44] lookth into the perfect law of Liberty
[1:29:46] and continueth therein he shall not be a
[1:29:48] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:29:51] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[1:29:53] amen amen so this man so so who looks
[1:29:56] into the perfect law of Liberty that
[1:29:58] perfect means a complete law it's a
[1:30:00] complete Liberty it's not a partial
[1:30:02] Liberty it's not sometimes you're the
[1:30:04] devil sometimes you're Gods no that
[1:30:06] complete law is I always was God's and I
[1:30:09] always will be God's I mean sure there
[1:30:10] was a time when I walked in this world
[1:30:12] and I didn't know him but he came and
[1:30:13] found me revealed himself to me am mean
[1:30:16] now I'm walking in that law of Liberty
[1:30:18] amen and the more you walk the more you
[1:30:20] realize you have amen praise the Lord
[1:30:24] see at first yeah I was just happy I got
[1:30:26] saved amen but then I got happy I got
[1:30:29] saved then I realized praise God I've
[1:30:31] got overcoming power against this flesh
[1:30:33] and then as you mature your walk becomes
[1:30:36] more stable you you know you begin to
[1:30:37] enjoy more of the word right amen your
[1:30:40] your walk becomes more stable and then
[1:30:42] you begin to also realize praise God I'm
[1:30:44] saved by from sin but I now I've got a
[1:30:46] home in heaven already this is part of
[1:30:48] the law of Liberty I've got a body
[1:30:50] waiting for me in the heavens amen and
[1:30:52] praise the Lord by his blood God's
[1:30:55] opened a door for me to step into that
[1:30:57] body amen what does that do that gives
[1:30:59] you that what is that that's a law of
[1:31:01] Liberty having greater impact in your
[1:31:04] life than ever before so let's just
