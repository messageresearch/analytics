[45:26] amen if you've got your Bibles handy
[45:29] let's just go to Romans chapter 1 and
[45:34] we're gonna we're going to read from
[45:37] verse 19 and we're gonna read down to
[45:42] verse we're going to read unto the end
[45:44] of the chapter
[45:49] no it says see it's here because that
[45:58] which may be known of God is manifest in
[46:01] them I'll see if I can like I can
[46:04] manifest in them for God has showed it
[46:07] unto them for the invisible things of
[46:09] him from the creation of the world are
[46:12] clearly seen being understood by the
[46:14] things that are made even his eternal
[46:16] power and Godhead so that they are
[46:18] without excuse because that when they
[46:21] knew God they glorified him not as God
[46:24] neither we're thankful but became vain
[46:27] in their imaginations and their foolish
[46:29] heart was darkened professing themselves
[46:31] to be wise they became fools and changed
[46:35] the glory of the incorruptible God into
[46:38] an image made like a corruptible man and
[46:40] to birds and four-footed beasts and to
[46:43] creeping things wherefore God also gave
[46:45] them up to uncleanness through the lusts
[46:47] of their own hearts to dishonour their
[46:49] own bodies between themselves who
[46:51] changed the truth of God into a lie and
[46:52] worshipped and served the creature more
[46:55] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[46:57] amen for this cause God gave them up
[47:01] unto vile affections for even their
[47:03] women to change the natural use into
[47:05] that which is against nature and
[47:07] likewise also the men leaving the
[47:08] natural use of the woman burned in their
[47:10] lust one towards another even men with
[47:13] men with men working that which is
[47:15] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[47:17] that recompence of the errors which was
[47:20] meet and even as they did not like to
[47:23] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[47:25] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[47:28] those things which are not convenient
[47:29] being filled with all unrighteousness
[47:31] fornication wickedness covetousness
[47:34] maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[47:36] deceit malignity whisperers backbiters
[47:39] haters of god despiteful proud boasters
[47:43] inventors inventors of evil things
[47:46] disobedient to parents without
[47:48] understanding covenantbreakers without
[47:50] natural affection implacable unmerciful
[47:53] who knowing the judgment of God that
[47:56] they which commit such things are worthy
[47:59] of death not only do the same but have
[48:01] pleasure and them
[48:03] that do them amen may the Lord bless his
[48:05] word you may have your seats this
[48:07] morning
[48:08] I know it's bit of a quite a heavy piece
[48:12] of Scripture I want to continue on about
[48:15] we're talking about the lady of C in
[48:16] church age and I was I was reading about
[48:20] your brother Brahim said though that the
[48:22] that the world will go totally insane
[48:23] and the world is falling apart you know
[48:27] when he preached the sermon the world
[48:28] again is falling apart you know it
[48:29] wasn't just a nice title he's declaring
[48:31] something and you can just go back if
[48:34] you study the last hundred years of
[48:36] history you see the world has fallen
[48:37] apart and it's just so alarming where
[48:42] well to me myself because you know I'm
[48:45] not I'm not well up in 80 or 90 years
[48:47] old so I have not seen the world fall
[48:49] apart in my lifetime I've been born in a
[48:52] time when the world already has fallen
[48:53] apart and so where where what we think
[48:56] as normal is not normal right so we
[48:59] think this world is well this is just
[49:01] how the world is because this is all we
[49:03] know but in reality this is not normal
[49:05] that's because the world has fallen
[49:06] apart so the reason I've kind of jumped
[49:09] to really right at the end of the church
[49:10] age because it's so allowed me just how
[49:12] you know our thinking can be so wok you
[49:16] could say based on our based on where we
[49:18] are in time and not and it's not based
[49:21] on the Word of God so we need to really
[49:24] look into these things to see well the
[49:27] world is this way we know the world has
[49:29] rapidly changed you know even my little
[49:32] 32 years the world has rapidly changed
[49:35] and it's changed a lot drastically these
[49:37] last few years that it has maybe you
[49:39] know the previous 32 years before I was
[49:41] born how society is how how how families
[49:45] are how you know how the West how the
[49:48] whole world has become has rapidly
[49:50] changed and the reason it has changed is
[49:52] because of this where we read they did
[49:56] not retain God in their knowledge
[49:58] neither were they thankful so there's a
[50:02] degradation of of society based on this
[50:05] where people change from worshipping God
[50:07] to they worship the creation now a lot
[50:11] of this I've already I preached a couple
[50:13] of years ago about making an idol out of
[50:14] part of Jesus so a lot of this is going
[50:17] to be
[50:17] kind of a reaping I'm going to expand
[50:18] upon it because we need to really you
[50:21] know it's quite shocking how different
[50:24] the world is now but our we we we the
[50:29] Bible says whatever the mind of Christ
[50:30] and this is the age where we have the
[50:33] mind of Christ
[50:34] so we've got to think through the mind
[50:36] of the word right we're going to think
[50:39] according to Scripture
[50:40] not according to culture or what society
[50:43] dictates is true and so we're just gonna
[50:47] go through a few things now as I ask the
[50:50] question now now how's this done and
[50:52] change the glory of the uncorruptible
[50:53] God into an image made like unto
[50:56] corruptible man and to birds and
[50:58] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[50:59] now how how is this done sorry and and
[51:05] it's done by taking an attribute of God
[51:07] and making that into a god right c.split
[51:10] God into a multiple multiple membered
[51:13] body like instead of going from one God
[51:15] now you have many now this is shown and
[51:17] the there's just brother Prometheus now
[51:19] there's an identified Christ of all ages
[51:22] now there wasn't nothing to worship him
[51:24] he was just the eternal and him was
[51:26] attributes everyone knows what an
[51:29] attribute is in other words in him was
[51:31] as thoughts just thoughts that's his
[51:33] attributes in his word and a word
[51:36] Express I mean a thought expressed as a
[51:38] word in the beginning was the word
[51:39] before it was even expressed it was a
[51:41] thought an attribute in this thinking he
[51:44] was to be God probably created angels
[51:47] first then he wants to be worshiped he
[51:49] was God and then in him was was
[51:52] attributes to be father to be son to be
[51:54] Savior nothing lost something had to be
[51:57] lost so they had to be a way made for
[52:00] that to be a healer nothing sick so he
[52:02] had something had to get sick so he
[52:04] could heal it it's only displaying his
[52:06] attributes now remember if he ever did
[52:09] or ever will have eternal life you had
[52:11] it with him then see you had it with him
[52:14] because Jesus came and Jesus was the
[52:16] Redeemer to redeem anything as to bring
[52:19] it back from where it was fallen from or
[52:21] went from redeemed to bring it back
[52:24] Suren God was to be a redeemer was to be
[52:26] a savior was to be a king was to be a
[52:28] comforter was to be a guide was to
[52:31] sacrifice you know was to be many things
[52:33] was to be a father but he couldn't
[52:34] express those all by himself right but
[52:38] then what happens is man takes those
[52:40] attributes and he takes that HIV out of
[52:42] God and makes that a God now this is
[52:45] very plain in the in the ancient world
[52:48] where the Egyptians actually because
[52:50] they knew him as God the scripture says
[52:52] but they didn't retain them in their
[52:53] knowledge and they worship the creature
[52:55] more than the Creator so they took an
[52:57] attribute of God made an idol and said
[53:00] now this is a God I was gonna take three
[53:02] this is this is a small God a per serve
[53:06] you pronounce his name it's a bull deity
[53:08] served as an intermediary between humans
[53:10] and an all-powerful God so this is a God
[53:14] who's an intermediary but we know the
[53:16] scripture says for this one God what is
[53:18] but there is one God and one mediator
[53:20] between God and man and that's the man
[53:22] Christ Jesus it's interesting that when
[53:25] the Egyptian when when the Israelites
[53:27] came out of Egypt what did they make as
[53:29] an idol they made a golden calf an
[53:31] intermediary right because they saw this
[53:34] in Egypt now then they fashioned it in
[53:35] the wilderness so they took a attribute
[53:38] of God and made it a God okay and then
[53:42] now and and this is the Egyptian god of
[53:44] creation so here here's now separate God
[53:48] but we know that God is the Creator
[53:50] rights they've taken part of God and
[53:53] made now now he's a separate going to
[53:54] take an attribute he's a creator right
[53:57] so they've now take split that off God
[53:59] they've made a separate God and then now
[54:01] here's a ERISA si think he's the god of
[54:05] the afterlife death life and
[54:07] resurrection but Jesus is I am the
[54:09] resurrection and the life right but
[54:12] Jesus also created all things and spirit
[54:15] for him right and he's also as the man
[54:18] he's intermediary so he's all those
[54:20] things but they split those attributes
[54:22] split them split it up into separate
[54:24] gods so now because of this man does not
[54:29] because they did this now they did not
[54:31] retain him retain God as he really was
[54:34] their knowledge made these gods and then
[54:37] now there's now a destructor a falling
[54:39] of mankind right so it all started when
[54:43] when man made idols
[54:44] took an attribute of God and made that
[54:46] as a separate God hey you're following
[54:49] me this is what happened because they
[54:51] all knew before the Egyptian gods ever
[54:53] came into being they knew him as the one
[54:55] true Living God right but then through
[54:58] the degradation of man you know Satan
[54:59] coming and perverting the work twisting
[55:01] it then now they have separate gods and
[55:04] it's all the way through it's all the
[55:06] way through the you know you can take
[55:08] you can take all mythology and you can
[55:12] actually take it back and show it's
[55:13] actually the one true Living God right
[55:16] even take the you know the Maori Maori
[55:21] myth avi of the win win win the sky God
[55:24] and the Earth Mother God was separated
[55:27] so heaven and earth was one but people
[55:30] couldn't be there and in this one God or
[55:33] whatever heat he caused him to separate
[55:34] so now there was a gulf between between
[55:37] heaven and earth and what happened in
[55:40] the garden because the gulf between
[55:42] heaven and earth because of sin right
[55:46] and that's where you see the you know
[55:47] there's the flood will injured and many
[55:48] different things you know many different
[55:50] cultures because they take what really
[55:52] happened and the devil perverts it and
[55:53] gives it to the people and they accept
[55:55] it and now the people begin to fall from
[55:58] what they should be into what we just
[56:00] read okay so you say well what does this
[56:04] got to do what does this got to do in
[56:06] our day God expressed himself from this
[56:09] day Jesus Christ came down revealed
[56:12] himself through a prophets ministry
[56:14] right the Son of Man was revealed on
[56:16] this day God came but the thing is they
[56:19] were not they they did not like to
[56:22] retain him retain God in their knowledge
[56:24] God gave them over to a river raped by
[56:27] and because they chose creeds and dogmas
[56:29] above the true and living God what
[56:32] happened is it you know you know as I've
[56:33] said you take the span of John the
[56:36] Baptist to titus destroying Jerusalem
[56:38] that is that is repeating today in this
[56:41] church age where the destruction of you
[56:44] know the destruction of Jerusalem is
[56:46] that you'd say the as the Great
[56:48] Tribulation and the nuclear war at the
[56:50] end right the the destruction of this
[56:52] world but what happened there as they
[56:54] did not receive their Messiah they held
[56:57] on to their Creed's and of
[56:58] and they're you know and they're
[57:00] tradition they rejected him and then
[57:02] they went from there down to a massacre
[57:05] they're in the destruction of Jerusalem
[57:07] just as this world is the same thing has
[57:10] happened
[57:11] God has sent a forerunner he introduced
[57:13] Jesus Christ to the world the church
[57:15] world wouldn't accept Jesus Christ they
[57:17] kicked him out on the outside this world
[57:18] is falling apart and he'll end up in the
[57:20] Battle of Armageddon in a destruction
[57:22] right but before before thee before
[57:25] Titus came and actually um he actually
[57:27] besieged Jerusalem three times if you go
[57:30] look at history the first two times he
[57:32] had to go and he had to deal with other
[57:34] threats then he came back but then when
[57:36] Titus came the first time then the
[57:38] believers remember Jesus words when you
[57:41] see armies encompass about Jerusalem
[57:42] pray that your flight not being winter
[57:45] or on the Sabbath day because the winter
[57:47] time is when there was snow on the hills
[57:48] Sabbath day the gates were locked so the
[57:51] first time they came so all this is
[57:52] going to happen then Titus you know had
[57:54] to go deal with another threat then they
[57:56] all fled the city they were all gone
[57:58] then he came back the third time and
[58:00] then that was it it was a massacre but
[58:02] all the believers were gone when that
[58:05] happened just like when the great
[58:06] tribulation all the believers are gone
[58:07] because there's a rapture amen so
[58:10] there's a parallel just like brother
[58:12] Andy and brother Hadrian now they're
[58:14] writing a book of Acts in Vietnam they
[58:17] were sent into Vietnam it's all part of
[58:19] the you know in the book of expand you
[58:21] have the Galatian Church come you know
[58:23] you have the Corinthians you have the
[58:25] Ephesians you have this Allah likens you
[58:27] can see all the things that they fought
[58:29] against they were in their churches you
[58:30] see among believers today because it's
[58:33] all repeating right so now but the
[58:36] reason that this has happened is because
[58:38] they rejected him and they held on to
[58:40] their own religion that this is actually
[58:44] and but now we're just living in the
[58:46] time of you know we're just living in
[58:48] the result of that good people not
[58:51] speaking against people but we've got to
[58:53] think now our society has fallen to such
[58:56] an extent why has it because of a
[58:59] rejection of the son of man now
[59:04] so they and this is exactly you take
[59:08] this into the Christian world
[59:11] some some say gods all love and grace
[59:14] that's part of them or gods or rules and
[59:17] judgment that's part of them or God is
[59:21] just impersonal God that's not really
[59:24] too interested that's part of I mean you
[59:27] know that's what some people make him
[59:28] distant he's not distant God right but
[59:31] they take attributes of God they say
[59:32] he's all love mercy and grace here's all
[59:34] love mercy and grace or is all judgment
[59:36] there is judgment in there too right so
[59:40] people take a part of God and they split
[59:42] him up say this is who he is now we
[59:45] don't want to we want to take the whole
[59:46] person
[59:47] that's why Jesus Europe the Apostle says
[59:49] he's Express image of his person so you
[59:52] know yes my brother branham he said he
[59:54] you know he used to think that the
[59:56] father hated him but Jesus loved them
[59:58] but then he and so what is that now that
[1:00:01] is that is the cultural idea of God
[1:00:03] because they had a Trinity three three
[1:00:06] persons in the Godhead you can the only
[1:00:08] way you can have a person is if you have
[1:00:09] a personality right then you know so so
[1:00:13] what he's saying is they said well the
[1:00:15] father's this angry old man who pulls
[1:00:17] out judgment just like in the Old
[1:00:19] Testament visit and now here comes the
[1:00:20] son he loves everyone but then he found
[1:00:23] out that Jesus is the heart of God right
[1:00:27] so there those are two idols but now
[1:00:30] they were taken down side no he said
[1:00:32] Jesus Christ is the manifestation of the
[1:00:34] heart of God this is who I really am is
[1:00:36] what God is saying the Express image of
[1:00:39] his person right so when you see Jesus
[1:00:42] Christ the things he does you see this
[1:00:44] is actually the heart of God to the
[1:00:45] people amen
[1:00:48] that's why the Pharisees and things they
[1:00:50] didn't understand they say how can he be
[1:00:52] with sinners and drunkards and
[1:00:53] prostitutes all these things talking to
[1:00:55] them and here was God coming to seek and
[1:00:56] save those which he lost those God's
[1:00:58] heart right now I'm gonna read a few
[1:01:04] things he says but they rejected the
[1:01:07] Messiah when he come to them just
[1:01:09] exactly the way the prophecy said he
[1:01:11] would come and done the very things that
[1:01:14] the Bible said he would do but he didn't
[1:01:16] come according to the earth theology I
[1:01:18] hope that don't hurt but I hope it
[1:01:20] anchors deep and they come it showed his
[1:01:22] messianic sign just exactly the way the
[1:01:25] Bible
[1:01:25] he would do how many believes that sure
[1:01:28] you do what was the Messianic sign he
[1:01:31] was a God prophet see and then and when
[1:01:34] they did it what did they call that
[1:01:36] messianic sign can somebody tell me they
[1:01:39] called it what they call it Beelzebub a
[1:01:41] devil a fortune teller because he could
[1:01:43] perceive their thoughts and knowed what
[1:01:46] they were thinking tell them of these
[1:01:49] things and the true Jew what did they
[1:01:52] say it was its the Messiah the Messiah
[1:01:55] Nathanael said thou truly art the Son of
[1:01:58] God truly you're the king of Israel said
[1:02:01] because I told you I saw you before you
[1:02:04] came to the meeting then you believe it
[1:02:06] you'll be able to see greater things
[1:02:08] than this then right they say that they
[1:02:12] rejected the Messiah and this is what
[1:02:14] has happened again now we're just gonna
[1:02:17] read a few of these because I want to
[1:02:19] because of what I want to do and those
[1:02:20] services really say well a case the
[1:02:22] Society's falling apart now how does
[1:02:23] this affect me right because it it does
[1:02:26] affect us whether we like it or not we
[1:02:28] are not impermeable to the influence of
[1:02:31] the world right we're not immune to the
[1:02:34] spirit of the world and the culture and
[1:02:36] what it's trying to do we're not immune
[1:02:38] to it I said we'll overcome it
[1:02:40] the Bible says we'll overcome it but if
[1:02:43] we're going to overcome we have to
[1:02:44] wrestle against and have a battle right
[1:02:47] you don't just get a free pass or here
[1:02:49] you go
[1:02:49] you've won you know no you have to
[1:02:53] overcome something you have to overcome
[1:02:54] you can't just you know
[1:02:56] to him that overcometh you are granted
[1:02:58] to sit with his and his throne his
[1:03:01] Dominion as he sat down at his Father's
[1:03:03] throne right so we must overcome
[1:03:05] something okay so this is part of what
[1:03:09] I'm wanting to bring you know if we
[1:03:10] don't see I think I come here I said it
[1:03:12] last Sunday but the devil the devil's
[1:03:14] greatest victory as if people believe he
[1:03:17] doesn't exist that's the greatest
[1:03:20] victory because if you think he doesn't
[1:03:21] exist he can do what he wants but if
[1:03:23] you're aware he's there and he's trying
[1:03:24] to you know get you and get your family
[1:03:26] whatever more than you'll be on your
[1:03:28] guard okay so now and it comes and goes
[1:03:35] out the people does not recognize it
[1:03:37] till it's passed
[1:03:40] because it never fits their theology
[1:03:43] never fits the time of day you see what
[1:03:47] it is they're always living in the glare
[1:03:48] of another age always the reason they
[1:03:50] don't accept Jesus and they didn't
[1:03:52] accept Jesus because they're living in
[1:03:53] the glare of the law and when Jesus came
[1:03:55] was not contrary to the law but came to
[1:03:58] fulfill the law well they couldn't
[1:04:00] accept them because his message wasn't
[1:04:02] exactly the way they had it all created
[1:04:04] out and it was and it was called the in
[1:04:07] traditions and he didn't come according
[1:04:09] to their traditions he didn't keep their
[1:04:11] traditions and really he upset it and
[1:04:14] tore it up and done things that was
[1:04:15] contrary to it and so much that they
[1:04:18] thought he was breaking up the churches
[1:04:19] and they couldn't receive him because of
[1:04:21] his message and we all know today that
[1:04:24] he couldn't they couldn't and we all
[1:04:28] know today that he came exactly in the
[1:04:30] line of God's prophecy but they didn't
[1:04:32] know it then and it could happen again
[1:04:35] and they wouldn't know it I imagine if
[1:04:37] he'd actually appeared tonight would be
[1:04:39] so contrary to what we've all got
[1:04:41] figured out up on our charts and in our
[1:04:43] schools and things and be very few would
[1:04:46] recognize what's going on he said it
[1:04:47] would be how he would come right so
[1:04:51] it'll be very contrary history repeats
[1:04:53] itself man doesn't change now I want to
[1:04:59] jump to something know this this may
[1:05:03] seem this may seem very out of left
[1:05:07] field but I'm going to show you this
[1:05:10] picture now this is this is North Korea
[1:05:13] now this is the extreme now in the
[1:05:16] political this is not a political speak
[1:05:18] but in the in the political spectrum
[1:05:21] there's the right the ultra-conservative
[1:05:23] who wants to maintain and this is the
[1:05:26] left that wants to change
[1:05:27] there's the progressive and there's the
[1:05:29] conservative and the ultra now they have
[1:05:33] changed their communist theology a bit
[1:05:35] these ones but they are under communism
[1:05:38] where they throw out the old order
[1:05:40] completely and they bring in a new this
[1:05:43] is actually being extreme progressive
[1:05:46] view okay now our society is not this
[1:05:50] and I don't believe it'll come to this
[1:05:52] but our society is what we call a
[1:05:54] progressive society and in order to be a
[1:05:57] progressive society there has to be
[1:05:59] change you have to do away with what's
[1:06:02] there and not everything that was there
[1:06:04] was good okay so I'm not saying let's go
[1:06:06] back to the whatever times but what I'm
[1:06:08] trying to say is what I am saying is
[1:06:10] that in order to be progressive and to
[1:06:13] change society you've got to do away
[1:06:15] with what's already there now what
[1:06:19] happens is now we live in a country
[1:06:20] that's called a progressive country and
[1:06:23] there are good things about that okay
[1:06:27] there are good things about that but
[1:06:28] what happens is now as there has to be a
[1:06:31] done away with what has been in order to
[1:06:34] progress to something else but what are
[1:06:36] we progressing to that's what people
[1:06:38] don't know but then what happens is you
[1:06:40] got to see now why why do we have such
[1:06:43] high suicide rates why is it so much
[1:06:45] substance abuse why is there you know yo
[1:06:48] why is it like this why do why do
[1:06:50] children not grow up and become adults
[1:06:52] they may become physically adults but
[1:06:54] they're still children why is this it's
[1:06:57] because society's progressed right and
[1:07:00] if you look at now you look at communism
[1:07:04] and it's in its very raw form everyone
[1:07:06] is the same everyone is the same now but
[1:07:10] you can't have people being all the same
[1:07:12] Jesus gave the parable of the talents so
[1:07:15] he gave some five some two and one one
[1:07:18] so everyone has a different measure of
[1:07:20] gift just like if we all tried to stare
[1:07:22] come and play the violin there'd be some
[1:07:25] who extremely good and some who are
[1:07:27] terrible and there be everyone in
[1:07:29] between because God has made us all
[1:07:31] different right but now what what what
[1:07:35] this does what society is going to is
[1:07:37] that the individual is not important it
[1:07:40] is the group that matters it's the
[1:07:43] individual is not important so what
[1:07:45] happens as society is telling us now
[1:07:47] essentially that you don't matter and I
[1:07:50] know people because I'm in the science
[1:07:52] field people have chosen not to have
[1:07:54] children because they have been taught
[1:07:56] they're just another part of the gene
[1:07:58] pool and therefore gone having children
[1:08:00] and having family and having marriage or
[1:08:04] whatever because they have been taught
[1:08:05] by their CEO
[1:08:06] gee that they're just another part of
[1:08:08] the gene pool and they don't matter it's
[1:08:12] true so so so what society has moved in
[1:08:17] such a way that they try to tell you you
[1:08:19] don't matter and that's why people want
[1:08:21] to get rid of themselves so I think well
[1:08:23] life's too bad too hard I can't handle
[1:08:25] this so I'm just gonna try and get out
[1:08:27] because I don't matter anyway
[1:08:28] you do matter you matter to God right
[1:08:32] you're important to God you're important
[1:08:34] to him right if Jesus died for one he
[1:08:37] would have died for you
[1:08:38] amen if he you know if he just seems
[1:08:40] Elijah to turn the hearts just one he
[1:08:45] would have sent him all the same
[1:08:46] right you're important to God you must
[1:08:49] never forget that because the Christian
[1:08:50] walk is individual right it's not a
[1:08:52] group thing yes it you know only it's
[1:08:55] it's individual show we're a body but
[1:08:58] the body is made up of members and the
[1:09:00] members are important we are important
[1:09:02] but in this kind of system the
[1:09:04] individual is not important right and
[1:09:06] that's what this now this is an extreme
[1:09:08] example we won't get to this I don't
[1:09:10] believe but this is where we're shifting
[1:09:12] where the individual doesn't matter the
[1:09:15] individual you you matter right I want
[1:09:18] to I want to pour this in if I can yeah
[1:09:20] you are you're important and you made it
[1:09:23] to God right you are important to him
[1:09:26] never let the world try and think well
[1:09:28] you're just another bunch of genes and
[1:09:29] you know nothing's important and there's
[1:09:31] 7 billion of us plus so it doesn't
[1:09:34] matter if I'm here or not it's important
[1:09:36] you're here God wanted you here ok he
[1:09:41] say well how did this creepin I want to
[1:09:46] know he sees here in Deuteronomy now
[1:09:52] what happens is I just I just I just
[1:09:54] come to the end of then come to back
[1:09:56] here see see where I'm going what
[1:09:58] happens is God raises up nations to
[1:10:01] bring judgment on other nations and and
[1:10:04] I'll show you that with Nebuchadnezzar
[1:10:05] and different ones that God raised them
[1:10:07] up God even said you're my servant
[1:10:08] ibeacon is ax in the occult Cyrus is
[1:10:11] Sheppard and they were raised up to
[1:10:14] bring judgment on Israel because they
[1:10:16] turn to other gods but then after that
[1:10:18] God said I'm going to deal with him
[1:10:19] because of what they
[1:10:20] and we'll show you in the scripture but
[1:10:22] what what what I wanted to show it this
[1:10:24] is that the thing that was raised up to
[1:10:27] destroy was actually already working in
[1:10:29] the people you take Israel by
[1:10:32] worshipping gods they had their idols
[1:10:34] you know they had all their different
[1:10:36] things going on where they get them from
[1:10:38] the nations around them and then what
[1:10:40] happened was those nations around them
[1:10:42] were risen up to deal with them
[1:10:45] well the bram said that the that Russia
[1:10:48] will drop a bomb on the Vatican
[1:10:50] he said communism was risen up because
[1:10:52] they rejected God poured a spirit out
[1:10:55] and Russia before he did it in Azusa
[1:10:58] Street but they rejected it and God
[1:11:00] raised up communism and then and then
[1:11:03] that and and then that tried to destroy
[1:11:04] all the real religion in the country
[1:11:08] right and so now God has risen that up
[1:11:11] to destroy the Vatican the world because
[1:11:15] of because of they've rejected God okay
[1:11:19] I just want to show you this because the
[1:11:21] spirit that was there in Babylon was
[1:11:23] already working in Israel because of the
[1:11:25] worship they were doing as I said we're
[1:11:29] not immune you say well I'm not a mean
[1:11:31] to what the world is doing the world is
[1:11:33] trying to change your thinking and when
[1:11:35] it comes down to the family level okay
[1:11:37] well I'm gonna go somewhere with us
[1:11:39] unless they see Deuteronomy 4 he says
[1:11:42] take heed unto yourselves lest you
[1:11:43] forget the Covenant of the Lord your God
[1:11:45] which he made with you and made you and
[1:11:48] make your graven image or a likeness of
[1:11:50] anything which the LORD thy God hath
[1:11:52] forbidden thee for the Lord thy God is a
[1:11:54] consuming fire even a jealous God when
[1:11:57] thou shalt beget beget children and
[1:12:00] children's children and ye shall have
[1:12:02] remained long in the land and shall
[1:12:05] corrupt yourselves and make a graven
[1:12:07] image or a likeness of anything and
[1:12:08] shall do evil in the sight of the LORD
[1:12:10] thy God
[1:12:11] to provoke him to anger I call heaven
[1:12:14] and earth to witness against you this
[1:12:17] day that ye shall soon utterly perish
[1:12:20] from off the land or upon you go over
[1:12:22] the Jordan to possess it
[1:12:25] you shall not prolong your days upon it
[1:12:28] but shall be utterly destroyed and the
[1:12:31] Lord shall scatter
[1:12:33] you among the nations and you shall be
[1:12:35] left fewer number among the heathen
[1:12:37] whether the Lord shall lead you and
[1:12:40] there you shall serve gods and works of
[1:12:42] man's hands wood and stone was neither
[1:12:44] see nor hear nor eat nor smell see is
[1:12:47] the reason this will happen because
[1:12:48] you're worshipping gods that are not me
[1:12:51] right so the spirit that so the spirit
[1:12:55] that was in the nation that was rose
[1:12:57] enough to destroy them was already
[1:12:58] working in their worship in Israel okay
[1:13:03] now we've seen him now as I see it now
[1:13:07] but then also this is shown because man
[1:13:11] and woman have fallen from their
[1:13:12] position right from from what the Bible
[1:13:16] says a family should be the the family
[1:13:19] the average family is not how it should
[1:13:22] be why is that because it's because a
[1:13:26] progressive spirit is coming and change
[1:13:29] what means should be in what woman
[1:13:30] should be and how family should be okay
[1:13:33] this is now because what's happened now
[1:13:35] is look they've all got the same Army
[1:13:37] uniform on all the workers you know it
[1:13:39] because they become just just it doesn't
[1:13:42] matter if you're male or female just
[1:13:43] everyone becomes one and what's happened
[1:13:45] now people become gender fluid all these
[1:13:48] different things
[1:13:49] everyone's become just becoming one and
[1:13:51] unfortunately it's the influence of the
[1:13:54] spirit in the world so it's not the
[1:13:56] person if either they're looking for
[1:13:58] identity 99% of them they're looking for
[1:14:01] identity they've been heard and rejected
[1:14:03] growing up because their family life is
[1:14:05] broken so they don't know where they
[1:14:06] belong and these people will accept them
[1:14:08] so I'll go join them because there's a
[1:14:11] degradation of because the degradation
[1:14:13] of family has happened because the
[1:14:17] relationship between parents and
[1:14:18] children have broken yeah you say well
[1:14:22] this isn't all that happy well it is
[1:14:26] happy actually because if you can
[1:14:28] identify the enemy then you could work
[1:14:30] against them amen because so now I say
[1:14:36] men men have fallen in this day what a
[1:14:39] real man is us even in history man
[1:14:42] hasn't really been man brother Brahim
[1:14:44] seed without the Holy Ghost man is less
[1:14:46] than a bit
[1:14:47] he's actually lower than an animal an
[1:14:50] unconverted manners lower than an animal
[1:14:52] and so now but what the holy ghost were
[1:14:56] you made into the image of God right but
[1:14:59] now what happens is Society has attacked
[1:15:02] man being the head of the home right
[1:15:06] they have but the thing is now the
[1:15:09] reason that there has been a backlash
[1:15:10] this is myself it's because man has been
[1:15:13] like a dictator right man has been like
[1:15:16] a dictator so there's been a revolution
[1:15:18] we've been oppressed they probably have
[1:15:20] been a priest to a large extent but then
[1:15:23] there's a rising up because man has been
[1:15:25] a dictator because man has not been in
[1:15:27] this place God because the thing is
[1:15:29] you're going to look especially
[1:15:29] especially you dad's that your children
[1:15:33] will look at God subconsciously they
[1:15:35] will relate to God how they relate to
[1:15:38] you and they may not ever really fit or
[1:15:41] really comprehend I'm actually related
[1:15:43] to God how you relate to me
[1:15:45] they don't do it consciously but that's
[1:15:46] how it will be so if you're an angry
[1:15:49] distant father who has never been
[1:15:52] pleased by any actions the child has
[1:15:54] done they will think God is a distant
[1:15:56] angry father that I can never please
[1:15:58] right
[1:15:59] so how they view God as how as as your
[1:16:03] relationship will influence the
[1:16:05] relationship with God so we have to we
[1:16:09] have to be very careful how we how we
[1:16:12] raise our chili how we act around them
[1:16:14] how we are that's why I say no this
[1:16:18] affects everyone how society is fallen
[1:16:22] well it'll try and drag us down too but
[1:16:25] God doesn't want us to be dragged down
[1:16:26] he wants us to come because this is an
[1:16:29] age of adoption an age where we come to
[1:16:31] our position in Christ right it's not
[1:16:33] only and that that position that we had
[1:16:36] joint is with him we come to that we're
[1:16:37] in that position that now is reflected
[1:16:39] now how we are in our family and how we
[1:16:41] treat one another oh yeah says likewise
[1:16:45] you wives be in subjection to your own
[1:16:47] husbands that if any obey not the word
[1:16:50] you may they may also without the word
[1:16:53] be won by the conversation of the wives
[1:16:56] conversation as manner of life I mean
[1:16:59] that's why he can live a sermon
[1:17:00] I mean you can live Redemption haloo you
[1:17:04] can live it amen while they behold your
[1:17:07] chaste conversation coupled with fear
[1:17:09] whose adoring their to be not outward
[1:17:11] adoring of plaiting the hair of wearing
[1:17:13] of gold or putting on of apparel but let
[1:17:17] it be of the hidden man of the heart and
[1:17:19] that which is not corruptible even the
[1:17:22] ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:17:23] which is in the sight of God of great
[1:17:26] price they men that doesn't mean your
[1:17:29] little church mouse you understand but
[1:17:32] God is saying I'm making quite spirit of
[1:17:34] great price in my sight but that's not
[1:17:37] that's not what a woman is projected to
[1:17:39] be in this age for after this manner and
[1:17:42] old time the holy woman also who trusted
[1:17:44] in God adorned themselves being and
[1:17:46] subject unto their own husbands even as
[1:17:49] Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[1:17:51] whose daughter ye are as long as you do
[1:17:54] well and are not afraid with any
[1:17:56] amazement likewise he husbands now this
[1:17:59] is really really well really where I
[1:18:01] want to get to likewise he husbands you
[1:18:06] know it's amazing Abraham and Sarah call
[1:18:10] she called him Lord must have been
[1:18:13] something he was doing likewise he
[1:18:16] husband's dwell with them according to
[1:18:18] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[1:18:21] unto the weaker vessel and as being
[1:18:23] heirs together of the grace of life not
[1:18:27] that your prayers be not hindered so at
[1:18:31] sea so it's actually it's actually the
[1:18:34] conduct of the husband actually dictates
[1:18:37] where their present ended or not right
[1:18:40] it's not the other it's not the spouse
[1:18:43] it's not the wife it's actually the
[1:18:44] husband you know men get so frustrated
[1:18:47] why why not why not why not they need to
[1:18:50] look in the mirror and say well this is
[1:18:52] why not weirdo I don't want my priest to
[1:18:56] be hindered now in the fall before the
[1:19:00] fool Adam and Eve had a perfect
[1:19:04] relationship man in the fall after the
[1:19:08] fall for a large very large extent
[1:19:11] doesn't talk a lot
[1:19:13] man is not really a talker right you
[1:19:17] know a lot of mean I know it's one I
[1:19:19] know who talks all the time but that's
[1:19:21] the only one a lot a lot of mark great
[1:19:24] communicators and they become very
[1:19:27] easily become very withdrawn within
[1:19:29] themselves we've got a break and I'm
[1:19:32] talking especially to myself we've got
[1:19:34] to break out of that right because God
[1:19:36] is not someone who always hides himself
[1:19:38] away and doesn't speak right remember we
[1:19:43] had to be has got it and we'll go to the
[1:19:45] book of Ephesians but as God us to the
[1:19:48] church we're to be to our our our wives
[1:19:51] right so he says now that we would know
[1:19:54] the reason I underlined a few things and
[1:19:57] so dwell with them according to
[1:19:58] knowledge now we'll get into that but
[1:20:00] you see Peter here is writing to Jews
[1:20:02] now the under the Testament are you
[1:20:07] under the Old Covenant of the blood of
[1:20:09] bulls and goats woman were second-class
[1:20:11] citizens and his rather than men right
[1:20:13] and this was showing and of the law the
[1:20:16] blood of bulls and goats could never
[1:20:17] bring the woman could bring the church
[1:20:19] up to be joined is with God joint heirs
[1:20:22] with Christ right but now under the
[1:20:24] blood of Jesus Christ now he says that
[1:20:27] we are that being is together of the
[1:20:29] grace of life so is together so you're
[1:20:32] you're jointly he's trying to tell the
[1:20:34] husbands you and your wife or years of
[1:20:36] life together you're you're both of
[1:20:38] joint is right because under the blood
[1:20:41] of Jesus Christ now this is showing that
[1:20:43] under the blood Jesus Christ we are not
[1:20:45] under we are not under God separate he
[1:20:49] lifts us up to where he is we are that
[1:20:51] we are joint heirs right so now Paul a
[1:20:54] Peter rather has to tell the juiceless
[1:20:57] because their thinking is still Old
[1:20:59] Testament thinking because that's their
[1:21:01] culture that's how they've been raised
[1:21:02] but he's trying to tell no you're not
[1:21:04] they're not sitting close to you anymore
[1:21:06] sure you still the head but they are
[1:21:08] joint heirs of life together with you so
[1:21:12] now but now he says and in the first
[1:21:15] part dwell with them according to
[1:21:17] knowledge now that doesn't mean just
[1:21:19] live in the same house well I know what
[1:21:22] my addresses there no it's not
[1:21:24] you got to dwell he says you got to know
[1:21:26] how to dwell with your wife you have to
[1:21:28] know how to dwell with your family now
[1:21:32] dwell in the Greek it means to reside
[1:21:35] together as a family dwell together and
[1:21:38] it also means that first part that word
[1:21:42] as primary preposition is denoting a
[1:21:45] union so he says you got to dwell so if
[1:21:48] you're dwelling as you're to dwell as
[1:21:50] one together according to knowledge so
[1:21:53] you have to know how to how to treat
[1:21:55] your family you've got to know how to
[1:21:57] have a relationship with your family
[1:21:58] right but what has happened this day men
[1:22:02] has become separated from his family and
[1:22:06] that's the not just in working but you
[1:22:08] see how you know especially in the
[1:22:10] teenage years and I I'm glad I've I've
[1:22:13] got past those years but I can see it
[1:22:15] you know when we talk about the world
[1:22:17] has fallen apart I was I'm a millennial
[1:22:19] and so I was raised in an era where the
[1:22:23] world is already broken and so now the
[1:22:26] the most important thing now this is
[1:22:30] meat but this is how I feel the most
[1:22:31] important thing is 1 the spiritual
[1:22:33] welfare of your family right but also
[1:22:36] the emotional development of your family
[1:22:38] of your children that's very important
[1:22:41] because what happens is the the world
[1:22:43] gets ahold of because the family becomes
[1:22:46] distant because you know just like and
[1:22:48] yeah as I've said and Daniel is that
[1:22:50] fourth beast power comes to divide
[1:22:52] divide and conquer break into pieces he
[1:22:55] comes down that spirit comes down into
[1:22:56] the family
[1:22:57] he divides husband from wife children
[1:23:00] from parents he comes to divide and
[1:23:02] conquer
[1:23:02] so now mums off doing her thing dad's
[1:23:05] off doing his thing children off doing
[1:23:07] their own thing and the family bond is
[1:23:08] broken the family bond is broken there's
[1:23:12] been studies done to show that a child
[1:23:15] develops so much better emotionally if
[1:23:18] the family has done it together real
[1:23:22] simple things are that they show on
[1:23:24] average it doesn't world look good for a
[1:23:26] child and here we are this is something
[1:23:30] I you know I sometimes forget but you
[1:23:34] know sometimes we think well we're just
[1:23:35] having dinner and it may not mean a lot
[1:23:38] to us cuz we're just eating we've done
[1:23:40] this for you
[1:23:40] is right you've had dinner I trust
[1:23:42] you've had dinner for years you know and
[1:23:44] you get used to but but to them it's
[1:23:46] actually a big because they sit down and
[1:23:48] now this is maybe just me but you sit
[1:23:50] down you're trying to eat and then now
[1:23:52] I'm having four conversations at once
[1:23:55] which is good but now he's a forum now I
[1:23:59] can sit down we can talk about our day
[1:24:01] we can you know just things start coming
[1:24:03] and you're trying to have full
[1:24:04] conversations at once and it's very hard
[1:24:06] but what if what if we didn't do that
[1:24:10] who are they going to talk to who are
[1:24:13] they going to find out the entity with
[1:24:15] right because because man is made to
[1:24:19] look for their identity we are born
[1:24:23] every nation under heaven they're
[1:24:24] looking for identity where do I fit in
[1:24:27] society where am i from
[1:24:29] you know what are my roots whatever it
[1:24:31] may be they're all looking for identity
[1:24:33] so if they cannot find our density in
[1:24:35] the home they'll find identity elsewhere
[1:24:37] right and you become what you identify
[1:24:39] with right and it says the same and
[1:24:42] that's why God comes in revelation
[1:24:44] that's why this message is so precious
[1:24:46] to me he tells me where I'm from he
[1:24:49] tells me who I am in him he tells me
[1:24:51] what he's done for me and he tells me
[1:24:53] where I'm going what he tells me my true
[1:24:56] identity
[1:24:57] hallelujah that's why I love being a
[1:25:00] Christian because I know run from I know
[1:25:02] I'm going I Know Who I am right and so
[1:25:06] this is my identity that's why being a
[1:25:08] believer is more than just something we
[1:25:09] do on a Sunday it's an everyday affair
[1:25:11] because this is who I am
[1:25:13] I can't separate this from me cuz this
[1:25:16] is who I really am
[1:25:18] hallelujah but with so but then without
[1:25:21] so God so the world is trying to give
[1:25:25] you a different identity but God wants
[1:25:27] to give you a real one but depends where
[1:25:29] your heart is that's where your
[1:25:30] treasures will be also so if you're if
[1:25:33] the Fe if the family's all split up then
[1:25:38] the children will look for their
[1:25:39] identity elsewhere and then their heart
[1:25:41] will go there right so now we have to
[1:25:44] know how to dwell with our wives
[1:25:46] according to knowledge we have to just
[1:25:50] living in the same house is not what
[1:25:52] this is talking about
[1:25:53] you have to know how to relate to them
[1:25:55] you have to know their needs remember
[1:25:58] Jesus didn't come to see what I you know
[1:26:00] come meet my needs apostles he came to
[1:26:03] meet their needs he came to meet the
[1:26:04] world's needs right and man but man is
[1:26:08] selfish for yo carnal man we have to the
[1:26:12] Holy Spirit in us overcomes this thing
[1:26:14] as long as we stay yielded we we die
[1:26:17] daily right that's why it's such a thing
[1:26:20] the the believer brother Bram says you
[1:26:23] know as an American I have rights to
[1:26:25] drink and smoke and whatever but he says
[1:26:28] as a Christian you forfeit your rights
[1:26:30] right you give your rights over you have
[1:26:33] no more I have no more rights anymore
[1:26:35] right because I've given them all to him
[1:26:38] right but if I think I have rights then
[1:26:40] I become selfish because what's entitled
[1:26:42] to me but if you've given your rights
[1:26:44] over you're not looking for what you can
[1:26:46] get but what you can give and that's
[1:26:49] what Lord you gave it all to me so I
[1:26:51] want to give it all to you
[1:26:53] hallelujah I'm glad he portals her whole
[1:26:56] life out I mean he wasn't just wounded
[1:26:58] but he died hallelujah laid his life
[1:27:01] down for a sheep
[1:27:02] ah hallelujah I'm glad I'm one of them
[1:27:05] so we're gonna know how to dwell
[1:27:07] according to knowledge now you say well
[1:27:10] how on earth do I do that
[1:27:11] because what what we have to understand
[1:27:13] is that man and woman are different man
[1:27:16] and woman are different spiritually we
[1:27:18] are different right because when when
[1:27:21] God made man in the garden as Genesis
[1:27:24] when he made male and female and the
[1:27:26] image of God God is a spirit so he made
[1:27:28] God as a spirit man Genesis 2 he formed
[1:27:31] him out of the dust of the earth you
[1:27:33] know look at those words created in
[1:27:34] Chapter 1 and formed and chapter 2
[1:27:36] they're two different words one's a
[1:27:38] creation and one's a forming of a body
[1:27:40] right so he took he made man as male and
[1:27:44] female put them in a body Adam they took
[1:27:47] the feminist part of that spirit took it
[1:27:50] out of took it out of Adam took the rib
[1:27:52] and you know a rib it's been medically
[1:27:55] proven you can remove a rib or certain
[1:27:57] way and it grows back do you know that
[1:28:00] because sometimes you count how many
[1:28:02] ribs do I have and if I'm a man I should
[1:28:04] have one less and people stumble of it
[1:28:05] now because if it's
[1:28:07] removed a proper way it'll grow back
[1:28:09] medical science and God's the best
[1:28:11] surgeon right and yeah yeah brother
[1:28:15] Graham says yo God would have taken this
[1:28:17] for a brought him just over the heart
[1:28:20] hello yeah that's how it should be I
[1:28:23] mean say was didn't take one done he
[1:28:26] took he took the room out of the hot you
[1:28:28] know you got to have a revelation that
[1:28:30] your wife is actually part of you a mint
[1:28:33] you got to have that revelation that she
[1:28:35] is part of me and why did you have a
[1:28:37] revelation he is part of me both ways
[1:28:41] hallelujah just like with the Lord you
[1:28:43] have a revelation I'm part of you
[1:28:45] Amen I'm not adjust to something you
[1:28:48] picked up that was floating along now
[1:28:50] you come to seek and save that which is
[1:28:51] lost hallelujah Amen hey you got to know
[1:28:56] I'm one of them I'm part of him that's
[1:28:58] why he died for me that's why he's come
[1:29:00] to redeem me amen I'm glad I'm part of
[1:29:04] him hallelujah so so now the Lord takes
[1:29:08] that rib takes the feminist part of Adam
[1:29:11] spirit puts it an eighth so now they're
[1:29:13] two separate people what we would see
[1:29:15] instituted for bill but God views it was
[1:29:16] one because their name was still Adam
[1:29:18] but then after the fall then eight then
[1:29:20] Adam gives us gives his wife's name Eve
[1:29:23] their one else different because now no
[1:29:27] man was over the woman right it has been
[1:29:30] you know in terms of being in charge but
[1:29:33] but now a woman has a feminist spirit
[1:29:36] and a man has a masculine spirit right
[1:29:38] we have to and that's why you know
[1:29:40] there's the same woman a Mina from mars
[1:29:42] women are from venus you know so
[1:29:45] separate I don't understand these people
[1:29:47] that's because they don't yeah well if
[1:29:50] you're a man you know you're made
[1:29:51] different and God made us a certain way
[1:29:54] you know I'm just happy how God made me
[1:29:58] in spite of all my things I see about
[1:30:01] myself I'm not very happy with I say
[1:30:03] thank you Lord for making me me because
[1:30:07] God doesn't make a mistake right so now
[1:30:10] we come down to the whole fact well how
[1:30:12] do we how on earth do we dwell with them
[1:30:16] according to knowledge now the reason
[1:30:19] I'm bringing these things is because
[1:30:20] this is what
[1:30:21] enemies come against he he wants to
[1:30:23] break brother I'm sit if you break
[1:30:25] womanhood you break motherhood you've
[1:30:27] broken a nation that's what the prophet
[1:30:30] Valley does motherhood he says if you
[1:30:32] break that in and say fatherhood he said
[1:30:34] mother you break real motherhood the
[1:30:36] nation's gone and it's happened so now
[1:30:41] we want to we want to go into these
[1:30:44] things just say well this is how we
[1:30:46] should be now
[1:30:49] well I've submit your yourselves we have
[1:30:52] that their wives submit yourselves unto
[1:30:54] your own husband's as unto the Lord for
[1:30:56] the husband is the head of the wife even
[1:30:58] as Christ is the head of the church and
[1:30:59] he is the savior of the body therefore
[1:31:02] as the church is subject unto Christ so
[1:31:04] let the wives be to their own husband's
[1:31:07] and in everything husbands love your
[1:31:09] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:31:11] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:31:17] might sanctify and cleans it into the
[1:31:18] washing of the water of the word that he
[1:31:20] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:31:21] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:31:24] such thing but it should be holy and
[1:31:26] without blemish so ought men to love
[1:31:29] their wives as their own bodies he that
[1:31:32] loveth his wife loveth himself for no
[1:31:37] man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[1:31:39] nourishes and cherishes that even as the
[1:31:42] Lord the church see st. you could ever
[1:31:45] you know recognize this is your own self
[1:31:48] right she is part of me hallelujah
[1:31:52] I say isn't it glorious we can be born
[1:31:55] on the opposite side of the world
[1:31:56] different families whatever God brings
[1:31:59] us together
[1:32:00] oh yeah I love that amen so now you say
[1:32:05] well so basically what Paul is saying is
[1:32:07] as as God loved you you have to love you
[1:32:12] that's how you have to love your wife
[1:32:14] right that's what he's saying so you say
[1:32:17] well then if that's the case then what
[1:32:19] do I want from God okay what do I want
[1:32:23] from God because of you husbands if you
[1:32:24] know what you want from God or what you
[1:32:27] need from him then you know what your
[1:32:28] wife needs from you okay
[1:32:33] so here's just a list and it's probably
[1:32:35] not complete unconditional love love is
[1:32:39] not shared with another acceptance of
[1:32:42] who we are right understanding want to
[1:32:46] be understood securely in the
[1:32:49] relationship so that's why I believe in
[1:32:51] eternal security amen provision I want
[1:32:57] to be provided for this is now this is
[1:32:59] me what do I want from God what do I
[1:33:02] need I need unconditional love because I
[1:33:04] see all my flaws and failures right love
[1:33:07] is not shared with another I want a
[1:33:08] unique relationship Lord I'm not just
[1:33:10] one of many in a sense we are but in a
[1:33:13] sense we're not right because the bride
[1:33:15] is multi-member body right but our
[1:33:18] relationship is unique we are individual
[1:33:22] with him we're not just a number never
[1:33:24] think you're just a number and it
[1:33:25] doesn't matter from here if I'm not you
[1:33:27] matter you matter one person can change
[1:33:30] your whole service right you being here
[1:33:33] can change the whole service you being
[1:33:35] here can change their eternal
[1:33:36] destination of one person you're
[1:33:39] important God died for you for a purpose
[1:33:43] that he would become one with you
[1:33:45] hallelujah he didn't just hang between
[1:33:48] heavens and earth and say well one day
[1:33:49] maybe someone will feel sorry for me and
[1:33:51] and and and and following me no he knew
[1:33:54] who would be there and he redeemed you
[1:33:57] for a purpose he wants to express
[1:34:00] himself that's why there's the earth the
[1:34:02] universe everything that's here that's
[1:34:04] why you wants to express himself to you
[1:34:06] hallelujah
[1:34:08] aren't you glad you don't have some
[1:34:09] distant God that doesn't talk I mean but
[1:34:12] he wants relationship holiness what is
[1:34:15] the deep calling to the deep people that
[1:34:17] deep in your soul because he wants to
[1:34:18] become one with you he was to spend
[1:34:21] eternity with you he wants to walk this
[1:34:23] life's journey with you holy just like
[1:34:26] Enoch he walked with God and he was not
[1:34:28] because God took him he walked with God
[1:34:29] hallelujah and that's just a shadow of
[1:34:33] us a type of us that we can walk with
[1:34:35] him every day amen provision that's why
[1:34:41] we're going to provide for our families
[1:34:43] but that's not the only thing of being a
[1:34:45] husband
[1:34:47] right Comfort we need this is how to
[1:34:51] draw them we need comes our need
[1:34:53] comforting God has to cover me quite a
[1:34:55] lot hallelujah our relations now this is
[1:34:59] maybe is be a repeat of one of the
[1:35:01] others but our relation that is unique
[1:35:03] to me alone so it's not your buddies
[1:35:06] that know your deepest desires and
[1:35:09] ambitions right hopes and dreams it's me
[1:35:14] your spouse should be your best friend
[1:35:17] right your spouse should be your ah but
[1:35:20] she won't understand well that's where
[1:35:21] you've got to come and she doesn't
[1:35:24] understand me well what's wrong then she
[1:35:26] should understand you better than them
[1:35:28] she should understand you way better
[1:35:30] than your buddies oh but there's some
[1:35:32] things I just can't talk to her about is
[1:35:35] that is that how God feels about us you
[1:35:39] know he tells Abraham Abraham's just a
[1:35:42] friend of God before Saaremaa gamora's
[1:35:44] burn he says could I withhold from my
[1:35:46] friend what I'm about to do he begins to
[1:35:49] share this is what's going to happen
[1:35:51] here after tells them what his plan is
[1:35:53] right now and goddess all the mystery of
[1:35:56] God is revealed in the same time that we
[1:35:59] know all of his heart all of his embers
[1:36:02] everything he wants there is nothing
[1:36:04] that's worth holding from us hallelujah
[1:36:07] he whispers thanks to you that many
[1:36:09] people may don't ever know it's just
[1:36:11] like there's many things my wife knows
[1:36:13] that multitude they have no idea about
[1:36:15] even close friends how Lou yeah
[1:36:20] because she is my best friend I'm glad
[1:36:22] that's true that's actually true
[1:36:24] how Lou yeah that's how it should be
[1:36:26] never think they will not understand you
[1:36:29] and this goes vice-versa because if you
[1:36:31] think you know that's the problem we we
[1:36:34] think God does not understand our
[1:36:36] situation Jesus was a child he was a
[1:36:41] teenager he was an adult he knew what it
[1:36:44] was like to lose family where was Joseph
[1:36:47] when he became old but says because he
[1:36:49] died right he whipped when Lazarus was
[1:36:52] was dead because that was his friend he
[1:36:55] had compassion he felt sorry for the
[1:36:58] others that lost he knew as the
[1:36:59] resurrection
[1:37:00] but as a man he wept because there was
[1:37:02] his friend was dead and he felt sorry
[1:37:04] for the others that had just suffered
[1:37:05] loss right he knows what it's like to go
[1:37:08] without he knows what it's like to be
[1:37:10] misunderstood amen
[1:37:15] hey who played at school you don't have
[1:37:17] put up hands but he know we used to play
[1:37:20] this game and I've run away from a
[1:37:24] certain person there's a primary school
[1:37:26] because they were different to us run
[1:37:30] away now here's Jesus now I've seen this
[1:37:33] polly well I have seen it before here's
[1:37:34] Jesus a twelve-year-old boy you think
[1:37:36] about him for a second
[1:37:37] they go to Jerusalem is the capital is
[1:37:41] the temple these the citadel of the
[1:37:44] romans whatever yeah there's all these
[1:37:45] cool sites is the battlements there's
[1:37:47] the gates there's the whatever here was
[1:37:49] David did this here and you know where
[1:37:51] does he go he goes to the temple and
[1:37:54] what does he do he doesn't just say how
[1:37:56] wonderful it is like a tourist he goes
[1:37:58] and any because it talked to the scribes
[1:38:00] and the high priests and you know he
[1:38:02] forgives it talking about the scripture
[1:38:03] this not a normal 12 year old boy who's
[1:38:07] on holiday even it's a real it's a
[1:38:09] pilgrimage but she was still a bit of a
[1:38:11] holiday change of scenery there's not a
[1:38:13] normal 12 year old he was different he
[1:38:16] would have been this is me I believe
[1:38:18] they would have probably played that
[1:38:19] game with him this play ran away from
[1:38:21] Jesus because he was different right he
[1:38:26] knows what it's like to be despised and
[1:38:28] rejected I mean he knows he knows
[1:38:33] everything we have gone through right
[1:38:36] but the thing is we think the devil puts
[1:38:39] it in our mind he doesn't understand me
[1:38:41] because he's never gone through it he's
[1:38:43] gone through it he was tempted on all
[1:38:45] points but yet without sin and there's
[1:38:49] nothing new Under the Sun see he was
[1:38:51] tempted anything that we are tempted
[1:38:53] worth he faced and he was tempted by it
[1:38:57] so so it was a temptation right he was
[1:39:01] but yet without sin
[1:39:04] see he understands what it's like to be
[1:39:08] in your shoes and I'm saying this is
[1:39:11] because many people think he doesn't
[1:39:13] understand
[1:39:14] me you you normally turn to people that
[1:39:16] understand you right that's why you
[1:39:19] think growing up well mom and dad don't
[1:39:20] understand me see go to your friends and
[1:39:22] that's not a way that's not the best
[1:39:24] place to go cuz what are they really
[1:39:25] know relative to the grand scheme of
[1:39:27] things you only find this out when you
[1:39:30] get older but they can relate to you
[1:39:33] because they understand you and your
[1:39:35] parents had fought the same same thing
[1:39:37] growing up just in a different way the
[1:39:39] same Devils that we fight as parents I
[1:39:41] mean our children will fight we've
[1:39:44] already fought they just they just
[1:39:46] rebrand every so often it's the same
[1:39:48] spirit it's the same they just go
[1:39:50] through a rebranding once in a while and
[1:39:52] and then and then us growing up we think
[1:39:54] well our parents won't understand this
[1:39:56] and they've already fought the thing and
[1:39:59] so what happens is now the devil gets it
[1:40:01] in our minds well they don't understand
[1:40:03] me
[1:40:03] God doesn't understand me so I'll turn
[1:40:05] to these people and they sure can't help
[1:40:07] you all there well right God understands
[1:40:12] you Jesus has been in your shoes and
[1:40:16] he's far suffered far worse than what
[1:40:18] you have suffered right and I'm saying
[1:40:21] that is that you got a I pray you under
[1:40:23] have a revelation that see you can turn
[1:40:25] to him right amen
[1:40:28] now attention I want God's attention hey
[1:40:35] man I want as a teacher do you want as a
[1:40:38] teacher it's like brother bury me see it
[1:40:40] about thee was a king Georgia saying
[1:40:42] going through Canada and all the all the
[1:40:44] school kids go out and you everyone's
[1:40:46] you know along the street waving their
[1:40:48] flag and shouting and things and they
[1:40:50] will go back to the school and there's
[1:40:51] one little girl missing they all panic
[1:40:53] and they run they find her behind a
[1:40:55] lamppost or something crying and and and
[1:40:58] this is along the parade route and then
[1:41:00] the teacher picks her up what's wrong
[1:41:02] honey you know didn't you see the king
[1:41:04] yes I did
[1:41:06] but I don't know if he saw me that's why
[1:41:08] she's upset Jesus always sees us amen
[1:41:14] forgiveness and not for us to be
[1:41:18] reminded of our mistakes and failings
[1:41:22] amen he doesn't use our past against us
[1:41:26] the devil uses our past against
[1:41:28] I meant you got to remind the devil of
[1:41:30] his future
[1:41:31] I mean nothing to come between us I
[1:41:34] don't want anything between me and my
[1:41:36] Savior but then I also want leadership
[1:41:39] where are we going
[1:41:40] what's our plan but what's happened
[1:41:44] Mina's been reduced to this day that
[1:41:46] it's just the weekend week out same
[1:41:49] thing no no no desire to do anything
[1:41:52] where are we going my god is a God that
[1:41:56] leads he doesn't push a Cerises follow
[1:41:59] me children let's go right he led the
[1:42:03] children of Israel from Egypt into the
[1:42:05] Promised Land
[1:42:06] right he leads us I mean out of the
[1:42:08] world into him he leads us and he leads
[1:42:12] us from there all the way into glory
[1:42:14] amen so you gotta have a sense where are
[1:42:19] we where are you going as a family right
[1:42:22] you got to have a view that's why I mean
[1:42:25] many men they they grow up by they don't
[1:42:27] grow up they want to stay as boys
[1:42:28] because I haven't made the transition of
[1:42:31] actually taking responsibility of one
[1:42:35] their own lives and one maybe their
[1:42:36] family that they've collected they find
[1:42:38] themselves in this in this way you got
[1:42:41] to have leadership where are you going
[1:42:42] you can't be led by God unless you're
[1:42:44] walking right yeah yep
[1:42:48] now this is this is from the fall I just
[1:42:51] thought I'd take this is very
[1:42:52] interesting and he said I heard the this
[1:42:56] is Adam speaking now and I heard thy
[1:42:58] voice in the garden and I was afraid
[1:43:00] because I was naked I had myself and he
[1:43:02] said who told thee that thou was naked
[1:43:04] how sour eaten of the tree which I
[1:43:06] commanded thee that thou should us not
[1:43:08] eat and the man said the woman this is
[1:43:10] his response now the woman whom thou
[1:43:12] gave us to be with me she gave me of the
[1:43:15] tree and I did eat he's passing the
[1:43:18] blame
[1:43:18] this is fallen man it's this person's
[1:43:21] fault and actually he's actually
[1:43:23] pointing the finger of God got it your
[1:43:25] fault the woman you gave me God it's
[1:43:29] your fault this is your fault I'm in
[1:43:31] this predicament now it was Adams
[1:43:33] responsibility because Eve was deceived
[1:43:35] and he wasn't he went with his eyes open
[1:43:38] and that's by him by one cent
[1:43:40] to the world right but this is this is
[1:43:44] full and man's response well it's your
[1:43:45] fault and this and this and this you've
[1:43:47] got to take responsibility and Eve yo
[1:43:50] you say you gotta say well it is
[1:43:52] actually my fault I'm wrong
[1:43:55] help me Lord I'm sorry I stuffed up amen
[1:44:03] but that's the this is full of man's
[1:44:05] it's always passing the buck we
[1:44:07] shouldn't pass the buck hold on to the
[1:44:09] buck God wants you to take
[1:44:11] responsibility God God takes
[1:44:13] responsibility he takes responsibility
[1:44:15] for you right he took responsibility
[1:44:18] fair demand Eve in the garden that he
[1:44:21] not so he what he wants you to take
[1:44:23] responsibility as well now those are
[1:44:30] some things that has been degraded in
[1:44:32] this day we don't want to we don't want
[1:44:37] to fall into that same trap we have to
[1:44:40] take our god-given position according to
[1:44:42] his scripture according to his word
[1:44:44] right but this is but these are some of
[1:44:49] the things now I don't know what the
[1:44:51] maybe we'll just close there because
[1:44:53] I'll go to something else and we'll pick
[1:44:55] it up next time but I want you to think
[1:44:58] about this this is all not selfish right
[1:45:04] this is all not selfish and also because
[1:45:08] you think God when when when we were out
[1:45:11] in the world in chaos who came to us God
[1:45:14] came to us he came to us first he
[1:45:17] initiated it right and every part you
[1:45:20] are from Genesis t in the revelation
[1:45:22] who's actually initiating the changes of
[1:45:24] dispensation it's God God came to
[1:45:27] Abraham Abraham didn't go to God he
[1:45:29] called him out right God you know and
[1:45:32] then and then they were you know and
[1:45:34] then now Jesus comes who was God came to
[1:45:38] the earth now sir now is the
[1:45:40] dispensation of grace there was a law
[1:45:41] before it now it's disposition of grace
[1:45:43] right God initiates it now there's the
[1:45:45] end time who's causing the end time God
[1:45:47] is causing it I said about yo from a
[1:45:50] mrs. Shalom the lights causing the
[1:45:52] darkness to come together but
[1:45:54] it's doing it right so God is initiating
[1:45:57] it so God always initiates salvation
[1:45:59] it's the goodness of God that leads us
[1:46:01] to repentance right so we as men have to
[1:46:05] actually take the forefront get out of
[1:46:09] our comfort zone amen
[1:46:11] let's where are we going as a family
[1:46:14] we're going into a rapture now how do we
[1:46:16] get there you're gonna break it down
[1:46:19] right and the thing is you say well this
[1:46:22] person's like this I can even become
[1:46:24] like that the scripture says if we
[1:46:25] compare ourselves with ourselves who are
[1:46:27] unwise we should compare ourselves with
[1:46:30] the Word of God amen you say look yo yo
[1:46:34] and I've said many times this front so a
[1:46:37] lip of God see it about the scripture
[1:46:38] and the message he says he says when he
[1:46:40] reached this when he listens to the
[1:46:42] message Lord he says there's a this is
[1:46:45] God in print as the person revealed same
[1:46:48] thing with the message Jesus Christ
[1:46:50] revealed she's saying as I read this and
[1:46:52] listen mold my character to become like
[1:46:54] your character it's not about just
[1:46:56] learning things up here I mean but God
[1:46:59] would make change me to be like him
[1:47:02] right because through the scripture this
[1:47:04] is the character of Jesus Christ being
[1:47:06] revealed same thing with the message
[1:47:08] it's more than just doctrine right we
[1:47:11] got another doctrine sure but there's a
[1:47:13] person being expressed and we're to
[1:47:15] become like him amen
[1:47:18] so now these things are all unselfish we
[1:47:22] have to be like this and the thing is as
[1:47:25] I said now God initiates we respond
[1:47:27] right and then now we come into our
[1:47:30] position but there comes a time where
[1:47:32] after that where the Bible says draw
[1:47:34] nigh to mantled and I'll draw nigh to
[1:47:36] you you've got to be sensitive to those
[1:47:39] times amen you've got to be sensitive to
[1:47:43] those times because now my family has
[1:47:45] try to draw nigh to me and with little
[1:47:47] children sometimes they can just be
[1:47:49] naughty
[1:47:50] hey bad attention is better than no
[1:47:53] attention apparently but apparently
[1:47:58] that's that's true so people and you can
[1:48:03] take that in a family children can be
[1:48:05] acting out what's because they want
[1:48:06] attention
[1:48:08] is actually a need that is deeper than
[1:48:09] what's manifesting in them you gotta say
[1:48:12] Lord what is the real need in that child
[1:48:14] I mean we're not here just to you know
[1:48:18] it's like a house on fire and and the
[1:48:21] fire spreading to the bushes in the fire
[1:48:22] you know you know pushes around we you
[1:48:26] got to put out the house first and then
[1:48:27] you can deal with the shrubbery that's
[1:48:29] on fire right but sometimes we just see
[1:48:32] the bushes we just put that out but we
[1:48:33] don't get the underlying cause of what's
[1:48:35] going on that's why I gotta take you
[1:48:38] everything to God in prayer amen he is
[1:48:41] still through the sooner thoughts
[1:48:42] intents of the heart right he can tell
[1:48:44] you this is what's going on with my
[1:48:45] family my child
[1:48:46] well what's happening in this situation
[1:48:49] lord I don't understand you show you
[1:48:51] something in the scripture to tell you
[1:48:52] right and so now we have to and then and
[1:48:57] then you can take that even even in a
[1:48:59] church body there can be trouble but
[1:49:02] what's really under that trouble we have
[1:49:05] to be sensitive of those things amen but
[1:49:08] we got I'm just gonna leave it there but
[1:49:11] the enemy and so I said that's why I
[1:49:13] brought him that before that this world
[1:49:16] being progressive as it is now it was
[1:49:18] the wife way what has been and it
[1:49:21] doesn't care what that is even if it is
[1:49:23] good it wants to get rid of it and this
[1:49:26] is already very much in this country
[1:49:27] very much in this society that we live
[1:49:30] in in the West and you got to think now
[1:49:32] well how has this affected my thinking
[1:49:34] this is what I wanted to preach as well
[1:49:36] because you got to think now how is my
[1:49:38] thinking is it is it is it lift of Sinta
[1:49:41] right of center or is it directly on the
[1:49:43] scripture according you know you got to
[1:49:45] think about it
[1:49:46] my outlook at how I treat my my family
[1:49:49] and everything is it is this actually
[1:49:52] godly or is it just am I just a product
[1:49:54] of my environment I mean we should we
[1:49:59] should look into these things because we
[1:50:01] can't just take for granted well this is
[1:50:02] just how everything is no we should look
[1:50:04] at say Lord am I being a godly father or
[1:50:07] a godly mother a godly husband godly
[1:50:09] wife godly child am i living that is a
[1:50:13] way that's pleasing to you I don't want
[1:50:15] my prayers to be hindered I want to
[1:50:17] dwell with my wife have a wonderful
[1:50:19] relationship
[1:50:21] I mean we want to dwell you know it says
[1:50:24] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:50:28] help us lord I want to draw them
[1:50:30] according to knowledge right remember a
[1:50:33] family is not meant to be a battlefield
[1:50:35] it's not us and them and I'm going to
[1:50:38] win here and I'm going to cause him to
[1:50:39] lose here and you know now now you're
[1:50:42] the you know I'm in government you're
[1:50:43] the opposition this is how we'll get a
[1:50:45] pass this legislation you've got you
[1:50:47] know no it's not that way it's not that
[1:50:50] way a family is not meant to be divided
[1:50:52] but family is divided in this in this
[1:50:55] day an hour you know say well it
[1:50:58] shouldn't be that way sure this troubles
[1:50:59] come and things happen but ultimately we
[1:51:02] should be united we're actually in this
[1:51:04] together have you ever thought about
[1:51:06] that sometimes we're actually in this
[1:51:09] together we're not against each other
[1:51:10] right I mean let's card the musicians
