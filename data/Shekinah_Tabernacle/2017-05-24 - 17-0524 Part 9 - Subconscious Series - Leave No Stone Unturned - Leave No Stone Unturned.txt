TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good evening welcome to the house of God it's Eid here I thought I saw the children here is your dad here he's outside brother Eid is he I thought I could hear him but I wasn't quite sure see I think if I have to look at I know kind of here I was going to say if I have to look at him pick who's being lost on the bush I would probably pick brother Chris his beards a bit longer makeup underneath brother Chris has been lost out at sea for a while okay let's stand up this evening and let's come up this night to the Lord wheel under great anticipation to hear from the Lord tonight and to be refreshing the Spirit of God to hear to hear the word of God and to be enriched and to leave here better than what we were when we came and to look upon the unseen things tonight not the things that are seen but their minds look on to the unseen because those the unseen things are eternal the natural things are temporal so we want to look on to the eternal this evening and focus all of our minds and all of our attention and all of the effort onto the unseen onto the kingdom of God and walk by faith and act and faith this evening too to just experience something that we can't see and yet will experience it because it's more real than what this is and yeah let's just pray this evening Heavenly Father we thank you that we can be

fountain of happiness the fountain of life or father may you open the gate of the fountain Lord Jesus tonight and may we hear from heaven tonight walk hallelujah Lord we desire Lord from you Lord we've come to feast at the Kings table Lord we find our places like my ship before the chef Lord where Lord Jesus we were lured invited Lord unworthily invited but father you had grace hallelujah Lord

we heard your cry we heard the scream of the eagle father and we alighted upon the rock father we are lighted down from our flight that we thought we were in more Jesus all old flying our own destiny Lord and one day we heard from thee tonight Lord I pray father you would just continue that conversation with us law and father I yield myself to you and I ask that you would just take control of these looks and be this heart this vessel and all the hearts in this room and whoever would hear this may our hearts Lord just be open towards your word is everything father and that you would speak your the great master violinist you wrote the symphony Lord you're the composer in the director Lord Jesus further we will desire Lord now in this evening time to be in harmony with your Symphony to be beating out the music exactly where the bird is happening long being time and in tune tune us tonight a little bit more Lord Jesus hallelujah and just give us was the morning divine revelation tonight as we look into your word we depend on you Lord any man can read and read the paper Bible or electronic Bible but Lord Jesus only you Father can open it only you can reveal the love language the love letter and Lord that's what we desire tonight borders through here from our the lover of our soul our bride group or at is she our husband Oh Lord father all bring us to our positions all speak it all word over us tonight take control of every spirit in this room use the glory of God Jesus Christ's name we all said Amen hallelujah bless you this evening thank you musicians it is just so wonderful to be here and you know just in a short time we can go from an atmosphere of very busy very full of the tree of knowledge and the things that we have to do during the day if that's you know what we're called to do in a our life outside of our church life and personal life you know and very quickly the Lord can take us from that atmosphere into this you know and into a place where you know we're caught up in heavenly places amen and you know and and that doesn't negate the fact that when you're out there that you should also have that atmosphere but this is this is there's just something different about when the saints gather together and we're here to worship God and that's all we're here to do you know it's it really it's different amen amen hallelujah amen let's just go straight to the word while we're standing oh here we go tonight we're going to speak on part 9 of the this is the second to last of the series and you know the series could go on forever because there's just so much but you know that there comes a time where we just have to say it's complete for the series and you know I'm sure the Lord will just continue to reveal himself and other angles and other ways amen because that's what he's doing and he enjoys that and we enjoy it don't we who enjoys the Lord revealing himself to you hallelujah amen hallelujah so tonight we're going to speak on a subject called leave no stone unturned Alleluia amen and may the lord give me wisdom and help me to bring this fall so our opening scripture tonight is Matthew 7 verse 24 to 27 and it goes like this therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it Lord please hand your blessing to the reading of your word and Jesus name you may be seated I'm going to tie this and further on down in the in the sermon so just don't be alarmed but where we're going next but I want to talk about here there's a difference between a rock and a sand right the rock is a sure foundation the sand and I want to speak I'm going to just talk about sandstone you know you you've seen sandstone it it seems hard it seems like it's got substance but you put that under enough pressure it's going to crumble and become what it were origin amen amen but it took fire to make that rough and wrought the rock and this is actually the revelation and the doing of this because he's Jesus says that a wise man will build his house upon a rock he's the man that hears the sayings of mine and does them now for me Jesus Christ is the rock that's the revelation of Jesus Christ that's the rock now he is the high priest of our profession and the King James but that's like the confession and it's also not just what you say now we are going to deal tonight about what you say but whenever I talk about what you say I want you to keep in your mind the tsunami it's synonymous with what you do because your life is your kin is also a confession your life is also a testimony so let your life and your mouth say the same thing amen so that that confession could be of an equal value between your life and your mouth because both hold very similar value in the kingdom of God and in the spirit world your life is actually when that life is in harmony with the Bible and the word by revelation by a rock amen by a true profession that life is a stable life of substance and that life is what shakes help that life is what is destroying the enemy Alleluia I will go further into that bit later but I just want to delay that deal the next scripture we want to read us from Matthew 21 verse 42 to 44 and it says jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner just keep that in mind the head of the corner you know what the head of the who knows what the head of the corner is it's the capstone it's the head of the corner amen it's the capstone so the stone that the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing amen and it is marvelous in our eyes is it marvelous in your eyes are you wouldn't to sing something hallelujah amen are you witnessing a descending of a capstone Amen the sending of the Lord Himself into where and to you and see your life God is laying that stone into your life this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes you cannot manufacture it it cannot be impersonate it amen no one can play Church around here Alleluia do you know why because you can't impersonate the third pool Canon's personate the Lord Himself hallelujah putting on flesh it just cannot be impersonated and when it tries to impersonate it all be found out you can see it because Satan doesn't want to do that does it you kick himself and he can't anyway but even if he did he would just kick himself for living the word he doesn't want to do that why would he want to do that that's why it can't be impersonated because the head at the corner is here amen this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever now this is what this is where the emphasis now for us here and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken and whosoever but whosoever shall fall it shall fall it will grind him to powder amen so you have two choices now you can be broken and rebuilt or be ground to powder and hope for the best man there's a lot good place to be in amen really not a good place to be in you know that I don't know this is just me I don't know whether that means you're completely lost or whether he just has to deal if you're a lot more harder than someone else maybe he has to take a son of God and grind them down to completely nothing so that he can rebuild from powder rather than rebuild from just a bit of a broken life or a trial you know and I don't know this is just me whether sometimes you see people that resist the Lord enough God just breaks them down more than you've ever imagined you know they end up becoming like I think been preached years ago on the sa Abraham was a saved you know it's like you had to grind it down till it was completely nothing and then through your experiment I don't know this is that's just me okay but for for this particular thought we want to fall on the stone now that word fall is a very interesting word it actually means that's the idea of a lighting to fall to fail to fall down or to light on now that word I looked up that and it says here that it's probably a Kenton wool to geo for 72 407 to through the idea of a lighting now that geo for 72 means two flights and that's a verb to fly so you see what I was talking about and what I actually was in them in my prayer that this flying you know we want to sometimes sometimes the Eagles got to land and actually deal with some things amen so sometimes you know actually there's seasons in our life where you know we are flying high and we're going up and we're doing things and we move soaring and then there's times where the Eagles just got to land down on the rock and allow the Lord to break them down a little bit maybe take that crust off their head that intellectual understanding of something or some crust that's on their head that needs to be broken off a little bit on the rock so that they can see something that the Lord is trying to show them about himself or about him amen so that they can grow and come further into the very love of God now you see now we need to alight that is that that word a light is like if you could describe it like a bird that is flying and it alights down upon your shoulder amen so when you are walking like a lamb and that Holy Ghost comes down like a dove and the lights upon your shoulder amen he'll come to a lamb nature but you see now you have to also a light down out of your flight sometimes amen and fall on that rock so that he can break you down hallelujah amen romans 9 verse 33 and this is going to place where this rock has been placed for us right here tonight in this generation as it has written behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen you shall not have the reproach of barrenness amen you shall not be barren no longer because there's going to come you're going to get with the mail amen and he's going to germanized you and you're going to be germinated amen so that you can actually bring forth a life hello now that rock that you need to fall on is actually within you already if you have received her Amen if you have received the Lord Himself hallelujah if you were walking with the Lord Himself and that's that's why the Lord says I'm going to land sigh and I'm going to lay in my bride my stumbling stone hallelujah you know when brother Bannerman this just before the seals was going to open you know he was he came out of their vision that showed him the seven angels and all that sort of stuff and the Bible was open to Roman's 9 and he send the law enter said behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone what was happening the the head of the corner the capstone himself was coming to the generation was coming down was going to be revealed now to some it was going to be a stumbling stone to the denominations and to those believers that was going to be a stumbling stone but to the believer amen it was going to be something that's going to stop them from being a shame something that's going to take away their reproach amen actually so glad that the very head of the corner has come to you to take away your reproach amen and that you are in the category that is falling upon that stone amen you're in that category now now what you'll find and this is what we will all find in our life is that and we're going to get into it a bit later in the story of Nehemiah as we you we've come out of Babylon we've come out of a cage of hateful birds every unclean thing come out of it and we've been showing an epistolary age we've been showing the message which is Jesus Christ which ties us back to the origin or the beginning the reality would be showing those things for a permanence let's carry on now we want to go I want to talk about this is that this is a very strong quote so just don't read it yet please so just how do i black that out of it here we go I want to just read this before we go on in essence this because you see you've got to lay your life down upon that rock it's a rock of truth and confessing you believe it the truth itself will become Rock and your current lifestyle will be broken by the truth and wrong God will give you he's got those stones that they're lying in your life because the word is in you already and so as you walk with him he's going to reveal things to you he's going to show you things and he's going to ask you fall on this he's going to ask you let your lip because this is a certain revelation that you have to fall upon it to allow him to break that old lifestyle or whatever that thing was that you were doing whatever that mentality was that complex was whatever that attribute was you need to fall upon there because that rock is going to break that current lifestyle and the rock itself will become your actual lifestyle because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's actually going to build up your life and it's going to continue to build you up like in the story of Nehemiah until all the wolves are built amen and you actually see later on those stones that built that wall were lying and rubbish did you know that and the stones that are going to build your life I'm just going to say it now the stones that will build your life allowing in rubbish sometimes in your own life and your own vessel in your own subconscious the revelation that God's given you he's placed it right in your subconscious the stones the confessions the professions the things that's going to build the walls of your life and make you a wholesome person and make you the character of God a lying and rubbish sometimes in your life they're lying down there and you'll see it in the story of Nehemiah it's amazing every stone in our life must be tuned we cannot leave any stone unturned and we've got to stop confessing sandstones those stand stones that you think is your confessions that you say about yourself all the time and maybe we're getting better now we've been 10 parts now 9 parts but and over the our life as a Christian you get better it and you know confessing the right thing we've got to stop confessing sandstone and building our life on the sand a man will start confessing and doing amen amen letting our life confess the rock hallelujah and when that rock presents itself to fall upon it amen don't resist it stop resisting it don't resist it anymore it's no point of resisting it because you'll end up in in a trouble especially if you're a son you'll end up in the trouble because you can't go any further amen when I say son I mean daughter - you know synonymous yeah amen everything we think on and say needs to be sincere and aligned with our true origin who we really are amen and that's just another way of saying you need to confess from the Stone the rock the foundation of Christ which he's come and laid it with a knew already so please know just move on I mean this is all going to try to give it later on this is from the sermon the hour has come brother Branham says now the right mental attitude all you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude you're right mental mental attitude towards God's divine promise will bring any promise to pass this is a really amazing thing it's so simple and so elementary but it's so amazing that there is a real God places an importance upon this part as well then if this part can just hold to a testimony for long enough and stick the stand your guns or whatever the saying is stick to it eventually something's going to happen if you don't get swayed by your circumstances or by your symptoms or by all those things by all the temptations of the enemy stick to your testimony amen stick to it with all your heart with all your mind that sticking to it keep that mental attitude what is the mental attitude the Word of God is always true the promises of God are true amen God is faithful to his word and he will meet you your faith he will answer his word his promises according to your faith so we said to them when they approached them in the flesh as to by your faith be it unto you as per your faith be it unto you they held on they really wanted something and they just keep doing it and they touch the hem of His garment and they got what they needed leave it now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak now this is where that starts to really kind of bite I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that what so the devil doesn't know what you're thinking no if you start confessing that your faith is weak you're going to let the devil in on a bad secret you don't want to let the devil in on that secret maybe you might have some problems down there or whatever may be going on or complexes that make you never confess don't let the devil in on those things and then you just keep confessing it because that isn't the real you that is a sandstone testimony there is a testimony that under pressure is going to crumble the sand and you don't want to build your life on that a man you don't want to build your life on sand amen so you need a I thought that was quite good well my faith is weak no I don't I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that always say man that makes me feel good I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart amen I don't know the Prophet just understood something that Harvard and all those people are only just discovering now the Prophet understood that if you just keep testifying the positive and keeping your mind on what's positive and testifying that the devil is going to start getting unsure about you he's going to start being but shaky around you amen and there might in all reality there might be some frustrations and doubts going on but he doesn't need to know that amen because eventually it's all going to change because eventually what's up here is going to be trained down in those papers there and down in your subconscious and you're going to have perfect v amen and whatever you say now remember as we've said God is reserving those things as time unfolds and as you become mature he will entrust you with the power to just speak in anything happen but you see we've got to have the character we're going to have the maturity I'm on my journey man I've got a long way to go but Amen I'm sure we all got a long way to go you know hallelujah and you see that's just part of the journey but we still we don't want to confess or speak the devil's language because as soon as we do that you just man you'll just open yourself up and you go all right yes he doesn't really believe or now look and they're really now you see you can't really Bluff them either you can't Bluff them you've got to you when you're testifying these things you've got to believe it that's not like oh you're trying to go against your own grain your mental attitude as I believe it now there might be some enemies in the land that's surrounding you and trying to configure it against you inside your subconscious trying to pull you down and do all those things because I'm old habit but that doesn't mean that's you right that doesn't mean that that's what your mental attitude is so you just hold your mental attitude strong firm and confess what the stone is said because those stones are lying down inside you those stones that are going to rebuild your walls mrs. Jerusalem I'll call you mrs. Jerusalem where the soul is where the temple is where the throne is where God comes to dwell as inside your soul so it's like furtively as Jerusalem and inside used the land you know you're the land Jerusalem is inside you in your heart amen and now all of that when you come you know every time that a little progress happens is going to be enemies that get angry because they don't want you to progress and there's going to be things that happen and all sorts of stuff that goes on to try and pull you down to try and distract you and get you focusing on something that's negative just stand your testimony never give up on your testimony never give up on your profession amen because he's the high priest of your profession I mean there's a supernatural element here I'm not trying to tell you positive thinking mental gymnastics tough I'm telling you that there is a supernatural backing hallelujah of backing towards your confession you're not just confessing 30 Amen you're confessing a supernatural God hallelujah that's living inside you amen so when you're confessing these things it's not like what the psychology world they're just empty and they might get results but they don't get our results amen because what we're confessing is the truth for one thing what we're confessing is part of an eternal God with eternal power to actually make the change possible and happen and so we've got good backing amen there's there's good funds in the bank hallelujah and you've got a checkbook with written in the blood of Jesus amen hallelujah we ain't going to get far down here I can do it so let's go it says here I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil when you accept them as your healer don't never act like you're sick or crippled anymore believe that you're healed take your Mathers word then it's all over on God then and not on you see now you need it this needs to be quicken to you these things start to get quite serious you can't just go out on a on a woman start doing things that are completely opposite it has to be quick until you have to be very serious about these things I want to just go willy-nilly and start doing these sort of things if you're on medication or you know you're doing something that's going to cause danger or cause change and this gods quicken that to you and this that's become a reality to you and this you're willing to fight it out and bear the reproach through thick and thin because there is a will be a reproach it will be a battle it will be a fight so then it you need to enter these metals ready ready amen brother Branham said to the people don't come into this prayer line if you don't believe you know there's no point you're coming because you're just going to go up and out in the Saints so you there is a balance to these things amen but at the same time the Prophet is been making a clear definition here and when this whole sort has been made a reality to you it's a very simple thing it's just holding sticking stand fast to your testimony to what God is showing you to the stones that are being lifted out of the rubbish of your life the rubbish that's been refused because you see when you came out of Babylon you were like you know Nehemiah the Kings copier and one day a burden came on your heart hallelujah something changed something shifted in your thinking and you look back and you saw the you the condition of your life you saw the walls that were all broken down and all the nostalgia came of a form of glory that what you could be restored back and all they will go into later let me just carry on for a second as long as you take God at His Word then the word will produce what it promised to you to do as long as you take God at His Word though workers then the word will produce what did promise to you to do is that right well his word returned boy no so if he gives you a word if he takes a stone and he brings it out to you and says fall on this let this become you this is your promise this is my promise to you take him at his word and never let that testimony wither never change that testimony no matter what sand ballots come to you okay Sanballat was the resistance to Nehemiah and we'll talk about them later never let it the - no matter what opposition comes hold to that testimony and the fact that you're getting opposition is a very good singer Amen from within and from without that resistance is a very good sign that what you're testifying what your life is saying is actually good and you're holding to something real with substance hallelujah now Jesus here was speaking he said father the time has come and this is where he brings the belt here he goes now they're seasons for everything do you believe that you've so in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there's seasons when the time comes that's right for things to happen do you believe that and the servants called the hour has come so I think it's time amen the hour has come we're at the fullness of time there's been a great sowing coming into this bride coming into our lives he's actually sowing the head of the corner he's sewing the rock of our salvation he's Solon the very lord himself so if he's sowing into Sion into the bride into you if he's sewing into you himself not just the restoration of the gifts not just sanctification not just justification not just these bits and bobs but the fullness that you have access to every single thing and everything that you confess that's in that word is your inheritance amen and so if there's something God's placed on your heart like I preached earlier what you're failing whatever you'll fail that lately just work through that don't search everything in your life or and you get overwhelmed by all of the stuff that needs to go on and happen let God do that choosing that God actually bring up what needs to be brought up at the season that needs to be brought up so that he can deal with that between you and honey amen and stick with it until it's finished don't move on the devil will try and make you move on just before you get deliverance just before you get the victory he will put other problems in your life and you make you fail there no just wait God might be dealing with that thing and don't just turn from a whole deal with another time I'll go to the altar another time whatever however God deals with you how he speaks with you let it be dealt with amen don't you know and we all do that I'm sure I do it anyway as you know the laws dealing with something and then the next thing comes up and you sort of put that aside and then you start to get things going on that and God starts at the author so you get victory there and then another thing comes up and distractions and busyness and whatever I know it sounds easier said than done because we are in a battle and the enemy's been doing for 6,000 years but if we can just stay close to the captain if we can stay close to the rock and fall on him and rely on him amen the battle belongs to the law the seasons and his program belongs to him he will give us the discernment he will give us the vision and the wisdom because rovenland when I'll say it now the revelation that you get like a stone a rock of Revelation and it builds and it builds and you get more in a bill stone upon stone and it's actually creating the vision for your life it's giving you spiritual vision it's allowing you to see the ministry preach then and there and the testimony that's happening in the Fellowship is all bringing vision to you so that you can see things for what they really are so that you can see with spiritual eyes and not just see with your own intellect or understanding but revelation upon revelation brings vision stone upon stone is going to rebuild your life and you're going to become a city that is built with walls amen but with proper defenses that the devil can't touch bearing the reproach who remembers the story of John Ryan brother branham tells the story many times because here's a man that received a healing from God and God spoke to this man and it didn't just happen straight away and he didn't understand and so God he came back in the prayer line and there the Prophet said I thought you believed I do believe brother Brennan but it hasn't happened he said just go and testify now this man was ridiculed and laughed at but he had been given the word from the Lord and so he held to that word and regardless of the reproach and the embarrassment and Wow how people thought he was crazy the whole town was probably thought this man has gone off the nuts amen this then this man's gone down with those Holy Roller nuts and he's become a nut case and it was all this big thing extra extra praise the Lord for healing me Amen that man hallelujah he bore the reproach and you know what God's and let it come out sometimes the medicine that you need and your healing is going to take a reproach and that's up to the Lord and so you might have to go through a John Ryan experience sometimes to get a healing Amen God might promise you and you might come up here and the word might come over your life and you might get healed and then all of us and the manifestation hasn't happened but maybe God wants you to bear some reproach for it he wants you to testify what your faith is seeing and not what your eyes are seen not what your body is feeling not what the doctor is saying about what faith is saying what faith is see because faith is the true vision best time to look at the promises Amen and that leads us on to Abraham who embraced the promises amen and I believe that we are a people that are embracing the promises of God hallelujah what are some embraces to grab hold of and Linnet just become dear to you and have a hope a man that sounds bad but it's a hope a real hope a godly Hope which is an anticipation Amen so when something's promise to you hallelujah when something's promise to you and before it actually becomes a reality in your life there is always a period where there is hope which is actually because faith now is the substance of what you hope for so there's a period where you've got a hook for something is appear where you look or something quickens to you and you're like all yes that's mine I'm going to have that I want that and now you've got an anticipation and it's a pleasurable in census and page because you're craving after that you want that you're you're drawing from the wells of salvation rejoicing amen while you're embracing the promises amen while you're carrying yourself embracing that promise hoping until one day Amen God turns that hope into substance and that becomes faith hallelujah and then you really got it then amen and then it all just sinks down and whatever needs to happen happens Alleluia but we must that we need to embrace those promises of God we need to let all of them laugh with this sense it's life or death this is like you we cannot just be willing nilly about it or we cannot just be blase about it this is a battle this is a fighting the good fight of faith fighting the good fight of faith and it's all planned for you Amen God knows just how to deal with you he knows that we're born in a microwave generation that's always used to getting everything straight away and so you know and it comes in the disguise of you know all we are the bride of Jesus cry then you know we're coming into perfect faith and and we're almost ready for the rapture so we should get everything by an instantaneous miracle but you see now God is actually more wise than just to give us everything instantaneously because there's still things in our life that need to be dealt with they're still and so therefore he will administer his healing in many different ways the manifold grace of God amen and so sometimes as I've said you need to go through the reproach sometimes you need to go through hope and you need to wait and and and call those things that are not as though they were amen Abraham embraced the promises of God for 25 years amen and he had a burden on his heart to bring forth a son amen to bring forth a life that was going to take on the inheritance amen hallelujah so he had to embrace those promises for a very long time and God wanted him to do that hallelujah because that would bring encouragement to us because sometimes we're going to wait a long time for things but that doesn't mean we're lacking in faith never confess that that's a sandstone testimony amen and under pressure that will crumble but a true testimony is yes it's mine God promised that I believe it and that's it the Word of God is always true it's always pure he is faithful I he would above all things that I prosper and be in health amen what above all things that I prosper and be in health hallelujah Nehemiah now we're just going to get into the very crux of the sermon here rebuilding the stone walls of the broken city you see near Meyer one day he was just doing this thing he was the king's cup bearer you know so I think you know that's kind of like us a little bit we build a cup of the King amen hallelujah we drink from the king's cup hallelujah amen and there's many great things in that cup their cup was poured out for us hallelujah so we partake of the king's cup but this man here the king's cup bearer in the presence of the king and one day a burden comes on his heart and he looks back and he seize this torn down place and he becomes burdened and he starts getting a real burden to see this Jerusalem being rebuilt hallelujah and I believe that God is placing giving us a similar burden to see what was one once upon a time and thrown by David and enthroned by Solomon and great kings and great things happen in the God of heaven dwelt Ernest and the Shekinah glory and and and then the neighborhood was a presence of God hallelujah was was it was awash with the glory of God and their victories and all those things and they must have been going to his mind he must have been thinking on those things above hallelujah amen and God started to reveal to him and show him and started to quicken to him then he's going to be he's part of a vision it's going to open up that's going to see lives rebuilt it's going to see what was glorious that was torn down be restored again hallelujah and we're in a similar position Saints where what was glorious under the Apostolic age under Paul and under the Apostles the foundation of our faith amen what was glorious there it got all torn down once upon a time it all went into the dark age and the church went into Babylon it's the same repeat of history Saints history has repeated itself and now we've been raised up and we've been drinking from the golden rooms of the King's Cup hallelujah but you know it's actually time that all of the things in our life need to be restored all of the walls of our life that make the defenses and bring us into our perfect order need to be restored and I say to you leave no stone unturned he that has no rule over his own spirit it's like a city that has broken down and built without them without wolf and so I'm tying that together you see what God is doing as he's going to make you a city Jerusalem hello Jerusalem hello bride Holy City being rebuilt holy priesthood temple of living stones amen he's going to make you a city that is fixed with wolves amen hallelujah he's going to restore you completely now but what does that mean you know on a practical that is he's going to give you dominion over your spirit he wants to give you control over those things because he wants to see a true leadership forming in your life he wants to see that you can lead your own spirit you can actually get control of your own spirit and and and discern all the things that's got incoming and outgoing you know inwards and outwards goods and actually have a clear de sermon on that so that there can be a true leadership in your life because he's preparing you because you're coming to it you're not just a betrothal you're not just a fiancee you're not just a wife you're not just the co-heir you'll come into something you're actually being trained you're being brought up because he's going to make you ruler over many cities and so right now is your trying time right now he's preparing you for queenship because you're going to be queen of heaven amen right through that millennial reign and probably for eternity Queen and so there is an actual leadership that needs to come out of your life and so yeah it gives you something to rule over and that's your spirit now how are you going to rule that spirit Saints what are you going to lead into those eyes so for what you linen is going to become a big problem in your life if it's wrong hmmm because that that flesh man will attach attach to anything that's evil like like you wouldn't believe real quick and those things need to be dealt with real good and how are you going to rule it since you're going to rule it with a malevolence legalism make yourself through this conform to something or by a true benevolence of leadership and love so that your spirit and your body enjoys living and actually enjoys and it can actually be balanced and express emotion and you know and BMB freedom truly free so near Maya to eleven to fifteen says so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in the night I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God had put into my heart to do it Jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the Beast that I rode upon and I went out by night now take note of these places five different points that he stops at then surveying the damage so there is a this is just a confirmation of what I was speaking on I think last week last time by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the done Paul and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the Kings pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass so then I went up in the night by the brook there was the brook Kedron and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the belly and so returned you see there is a there is meaning and all of these words here he went out by night and entered in by the gate of the valley and this is actually where when you enter into survey these things it comes down into a valley of your life where you're going through something hard and there is a there there is trouble and you come down into a valley and sometimes you you're going to face now the din of a dragon the den of some demon that's affected you that's hurt you or is hurting you depending on where you've been and what's happened and if you've been delivered but you'll you'll stumble across these things in your view when you're viewing the damage when you're viewing the walls that have been broken down because you see we cannot remain in a state of broken wolves you cannot remain that way it is not God's will for us to be a broken down city that's tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine tossed out by thoughts of your spirit that's allowing you to think stuff that you shouldn't think infections and vile affections and all those things that the Spirit will your spirit will try and think of you allow it if it's ruling you it's going to cause you lots of trouble and so now near my earners surveying of the damage comes to the done pork and this done port is actually the gate of where they all the rubbish dump of Jerusalem basically in G Jesus actually likened us to Hellfire tahina because it was burning there booth in rubbish and so you see now this is now coming down and looking at all of the rubbish because it was apparently overflowing and there was rubbish everywhere and the walls were all broken now there was so much rubbish that he couldn't his beasts couldn't go any further at the walk you know this was this is what the histories say now that I don't know where the next biblical or not but it seems pretty good because I'm sure it would have been because there was no more order to the city because the city was broken down it wasn't functioning there was no Kingdom net city but when the King comes back to the city thinks that changing hey men hallelujah hallelujah but you see now as he views and he sees all this rubbish piling up it must have saddened him and he viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates there I was consumed then I went on to the gate at the fountain fountain that word fountain means outward appearance start looking at the outward appearance and what your life appears to be as your life worthy of the gospel is that reflecting the Lord Jesus Christ is that reflecting the image of Christ and the message of the hour that's been revealed to us what is the outward appearance as you come and assess the walls of your city as you assess what's going on because you see it's not that's not the will for this age to live in that condition many ages have gone by many generations in the church where that's passed by and the people have remained but this is an age where that does not remain this is an age where that City is being completely rebuilt and you are that City you are that Jerusalem that is being completely restored and the King has descended into your city to rebuild you to rebuild your walls he went round here he entered in here at the Valley Gate and he will ride around here past the pool of Siloam the Kings pool and you see the dung gate down here was full of rubbish and as beasts couldn't get any further here and then he walked up to the fountain gate here we passed the Kings pool which is the pool of Siloam and then he walked back up here and then he went back out this is up the cardroom card Rhone Valley here and up to this Brook here I've actually been here go to the next one this one's a bit clearer so went up here and down here the pool of Siloam and this little tunnel here is actually here's a Kies aqueduct then I actually went through there it's pretty cool really cool but anyway he walked through here to assess what was going on to assess by night my secret to prepare and this is the thing that we need to do in our own lives we need to prepare for the battle we need to know what the Lord is actually dealing with and when we come into a valley and we discover that there's things going on this is the age that it will be dealt with this is the time that it will be dealt with this is the prerogative this is the program the plan of God to deal with those things to deal with the dragons so to speak that are laying down there that you can only discover when you're in the valley and to see all the rubbish that's been piled up because you see that rubbish that's been piled up is covering over the rocks of the walls that need to be rebuilt and there's rubbish in our lives that you know and maybe not all of us we're all in different places of course and some piles of rubbish are bigger than others it depends on how you what you've done with the Word of God how you've been dealt with how you're fallen on the rock or whether you're one of those people that resists it all the time and spake take ages and ages for to do anything and the Lord has to crush you down or whether when the revelation comes when the rock is presented by grace and you fall on that rock you know season the psalm 119 I hasten to keep like a man that took God you come to a place in your life where whatever in Lord O Lord if you could just show me anything that you were grieved was in my life I don't want nothing to come between me and him amen nothing at all and if something is between me and them and I don't know about it Lord show me if there's a complex in my life and this complex is in my life and I don't know you know if I knew where they came from I'll be dealing with them and I'm asking the Lord where does this come from why do I do this cuz it's frustrating me and for us ready for others but this is the this is our here it is to be free from all those things amen brother Branham says on outside this is the Bible you see the trouble we are in how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates Boone come let us build the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer suffer reproach this is nearby now encouraging the people and may this be an encouragement to you and I told them of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good and also of the words that the King had spoken to me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hand for the good work but when send ballots the annoyed and to Baia the ammonite servant of geese in the Arab heard of it they jeered at us and despised us and said what does this thing that you're doing are you rebelling against the king then I replied to them the God of heaven will make us prosper ever see in the face of all the enemy in the face of whatever he said if that vision opens to you and this is our vision our walls are being rebuilt and maybe it's the last gate I don't know you know God knows you'll know how far to a degree where your walls are at what party or walls is he working on what stones are getting pulled out of the the heaps down below the sand is getting cast off amen all those confessions that are false and all those things that you've said about yourself that are wrong they're all being cast off you know we're being equipped now this is what's happening Saints this has been happening over the last nine parts the walls are being rebuilt your confessions are being corrected the sand stones of your life are being crushed down under the pressure of the Word of God so that you can recognize that what stance though and now confessing the truth confessing the word rebuilding those walls amen be encouraged Saints don't lose the vision continue in your testimony regardless of all the enemies and all the same ballots had come and we'll go into that name sembalun soon it's very interesting he says here Nehemiah the God of heaven will make us prosper he says thus directly in this in the face of Satan the God of heaven will make us prosper no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper but you will prosper because he would above all things that you prosper and be in health what above all things heavy and we his servants will arise and build a men were who's building you the master builder he's building you amen hallelujah and we his servants will arise and build but you Satan have no portion or right or claim in Jerusalem and amen why don't we talk about the title deed that his claim has been what hallelujah he has no claim on you anymore the devil's questions been answered you have been freed hallelujah there is no right or claim of Satan over your life anymore so all those sin stone testimonies that you you know those things that you'll thought about yourself they're lies amen hallelujah amen you know we knew we need to be searched my heart oh God Oh Lord search my heart okay how do I put this don't just go and have a fun time in your life it's good to have fun sometimes don't get me wrong I have fun but don't just gonna stick this Christianity is just this big fun thing this is a battle in it's hard and if it's not hard you're doing something wrong now I don't mean like it should be easy I mean it's the grace of God will keep you but if you're not going through a struggle the Prophet said this life is a struggle if you're not struggling through things by the grace of God of course not in your own strength then it be this no progress without it because God's putting you through stuff amen maybe you're just you're ignoring the problems in your life you've seen the walls of your life and you know that there's a bricks there and you know that there's a bricks there and you know that this is there but they're you thinking you're my heart's too hard I don't want to deal with those things now it might embarrass me in front of the others Amen I don't want to confess them before my brothers and sisters but you can because you see we're all in the same boat Alleluia we're all in this together we're all humans amen we've all come like nehemiah out of this Babylonian place and we've been given an edict okay be king go and rebuild hallelujah and so now under the power and authority of the king we're being called to rebuild amen but that rebuilding is going to be a battle all the way and as it gets more and more the battles get worse and worse amen hallelujah but hallelujah regardless of all the battles and all the sanballat pressure hold to your testimony regardless of your circumstances regardless of your symptoms hold to your testimony hold to your confession not just with this that was your life let your life fall on the rock and let whatever that rock is become what your life produces because that's the purpose of the rock is that you fall on it amen that revelation will then become flesh hallelujah it'll break down the things that there's been problematic to you hallelujah Satan you have no right or claim in Jerusalem Satan you have no right or claim over my soul hallelujah over my inheritance because you see the king issued the Edict they made hallelujah the King issued it Amen it's got the whole power of King the king behind it mm-hm so nothing Sanballat could do amen I like that so much it makes me so happy to know that he near Maya for one to two this is but it came to pass that when sanballat hold on it forgives me I just want to just talk about I just want to show you there it is I must have deleted oh no here does the name Sanballat and it took a while to find this because it's not in the in the concordance it's actually in the book I've got about names and it says the name of Sanballat means sin save the life and I said Lord what does that mean sin save the life where does this fit in because everything but since the Word of God member everything fits guys telling you a story he's revealing you yourself and your situation and your vision in the word and it has to mean something and then the full he that saves his life shall lose it and he that loses life for my sake shall gain it so what does it profit you of you get all the things of this world and lose your own soul so what is the sin bellick come to try and offer you he wants you to keep your life he wants you to keep your will and your intentions in your motives and your objectives and your dreams and what you think is right for your family and your children Sanballat will come to you at all these different crafty ways and you'll get into your reasoning in your conscience you get into your spirit and you'll twist things around and then all of a sudden you think it's a good decision that I made that and really you keep your life amen you kept your life that's the temptation that sam bella keep firin it nehemiah and you see that same temptation comes to us are you going to surrender your life or are you going to give it to the Lord and continue in the vision regardless all the reasonings and all of that stuff question it as this part of the program where are we act oh man we're knocking on the wretches door hallelujah amen there's no time to waste hallelujah and so you see now we're going to save our life where we're going to lose it or we're going to lose our life and save it hey man that's the temptation and so the same bellick pressure would come on hallelujah amen it's character plays the part of the temptation we face to give up on the vision of being rebuilt and to save our life here but as Jesus said we will lose our all if we fail to lose our own life here and take up our cross the rebuilding of the walls is linked to a complete death to self and surrender to the open version that's coming from the stone laid in soil the stone lead and Sion is Laden all of you and he is opened a vision for our church for our age for our generation as a program and he's given it and it's coming from within you and it's coming out now for you to see that for you to experience that in to walk in that you need a fall on that stone and stone by stone revelation by revelation it will become clearer to you but if you if you resist that and you just keep walking when that stone is laying there for you to fall on and a light upon out of your flight sometimes you need a full light fail you know fall down fail and fall on that rock don't fall on your own reasoning and try and reason in a way that was everyone else's fault not yours because actually it was your fault amen amen even when it wasn't you just own up hallelujah always look to yourself first before you look at others amen did I have a right how could I have avoided that better I'm a son of God I can create an atmosphere Amen my prayer changes things hallelujah could have preempted those things you know and I think we're all grown amen I believe we are all growing I don't just think that we are growing amen and so here I'm going to read you the devil's question hold on he is rebuilding us stone by stone as we completely surrender to his will his vision opens as we bear the King's Cup and enter into communion that edict continues to sound and that vision for a rebuild a total rebuild a total deliverance a total cleansing a total finishing of Jerusalem and your life amen it's all being rebuilt we're on a journey you don't just stay in Egypt you don't stay in the wilderness you don't start Gilgal you don't stay at Jericho you don't stay a I you don't stay you know all those different places you don't stay there you move on hallelujah you come to Jerusalem amen and that's where you know you see that our God is restoring you restoring your soul restoring everything in your life so that there is those walls being rebuilt that is the vision that is happening Alleluia this is the devil's Christians here since but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we rebuilded the walk we built the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he speak before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are boomed will those stones be revived even though they've been laying down and rubbish even though they've been laying down in ideologies they are stones and they cannot be destroyed hallelujah these are stones that are rebuilding your walls the stones of God's truth that's been laid in your heart it's in you what you confess is already within you you're not lying you're not just preaching some ideology it is a reality now will these stones be revived will these stones be unturned and put in their place to rebuild your life will they be will you hold to your confession I say yes Amy I say that we don't relate amen we hold to our testimony we confess it even though we can't see it sometimes you know Amy we speak it because this is the vision I am being rebuilt my life was coming into order hallelujah I have strong faith Amen I'm a son of God I love Jesus Christ with all my heart amen glory to God stay with your confession never get discouraged by your symptoms maintain your testimony of faith regardless and so doing you are sending a consistent message to your subconscious that you believe 100% of the time eventually you will believe 100 proceed all the way down brother Brendan said when you get the conscious and the subconscious all in line then whatever you say will happen so there in that's perfect faith that's when there's no doubt ever and any part of your life because you've got complete dominion and everything's coming to London amen and come to perfect faith fight the good fight beer the reproach and reap the rewards play the long game play the long game don't just look at the now all the time faith actually sees far into the future and looks at the end sees the vision amen that's what brother Brendan see faith sees right down to the end a man like that guy riding on that piece of plank you know that the Prophet talked about there's all those riders and they're all top riders and then this is like weirdo guy he comes down a little scrawny fellow his budget bike and they all thought all this guy's going to fail you know and they all failed and he got to the end and they said to him what did you do and he said you guys were all looking down right where you are at I looked at heaven and I kept on going walk the straight and narrow path hallelujah that's what our faith needs to see is that vision to know that that's where you're going and that's where you this your reality say hallelujah keep your eyes on the prize keep your eyes on the on the as of the higher call it gave me Alleluia that is our focus as Jesus Christ that and has eat it so his edict is behind us saying you are I give you all authority I give you all the needs that you have to be rebuilt and Here I am Hartley in waiting for you amen and not only that I'm in you hallelujah that same stone is right within you and the revelation just keeps coming out the revelation just keeps coming out fall on this my son fall on this my daughter look at this in your life assess that breach in that wall there you see hallelujah God says that he right at the end time he would bind up the breech of his people isaiah 30:26 i will bind up heal the stroke of their wounds and i will bind up the breech of my people as right now that all the breaches everything in your life is being restored being rebuilt but it's not just a magic one amen that's a process it's a battle to fight the good fight of faith being their approach amen because you see if you just keep believing all the time you're training the subconscious you're training the people down in the engine room we really do believe that's like leading your children if your children see you waver and every little thing and and the slightest thing comes up and you're not at church this list comes up in their net and they watch that you're training in the wrong way it's false leadership it's not a true image that they're beholding and because of that they get trained in a certain way in one day what you've trained them all their life will manifest and then you'll be by that time you're probably far on on your journey and you're looking and you're seeing your self again and you're looking at that and you're going by now this very similar situation to your subconscious and between your conscious and your subconscious the decisions you make in the the testimony that you hold in the face of any Sanballat temptation any Sanballat struggle any symptom even if you're in the middle of a fish down the bottom of the sea amen Jonah's subconscious was trained well a man they got some good lessons that they they may regardless of testable regardless of circumstances regardless of anything I'm going to hold and you know eventually eventually it'll pay off you might look like a silly person you might look weird and whatever your colleagues and friends and whatnot tell you and speak to you about but is a training going on there's a there's a there's a focus going on there's a purpose in it and you amen play the long game look at that in look towards the prize of the high calling amen which is Christ amen he brother Brad was here because remember this the whole ship analogy and everything we won't go into it but he said that this ship of Zion with the stabilizers on his ship she's going to crisp every wave and she's going to continue over every way and who's waiting on the shore amen who's waiting there none other than our Lord Jesus amen the high priest themself waiting on the shores of the rapture for us to be to seeing them to hold them with their eyes where faith becomes sight amen now this is the practical right here at the end amen the stones that actually rebuild the wall not these should I say stones that do because there's other parts as well of course let me just hit this I'm just going to go through a few examples and then we're basically finished this is a certain situation now remember this is generalization and it's not pointed at anybody and then many times not even it myself but these are these are hypothetical circumstance --is that I was led to put in here and if you can identify with anything here then the Lord can deal with that amen so one second stance here is I can't bring myself to look forward to prayer now maybe people go through that and these are some of the testimonies or the the situation that you can you can continue to confess that if you like but I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend it I was always ignored as a child I was always told it's rude to ask for something every everything was given to me and I was seldom said no told no I'm spending too much time under pest of stimuli so this is this is a testimony of some earnest that's building their life on the sand or that was built on sin right let personal stimuli psyche entertainment just sitting there being fed and you do you've got no you've got no participation in it Satan opens your mind and whatever goes in is just this demonic horrendous ordeal now that testimony is sandstone if you just continue or was always ignored as a child and all lowers me that you're just going to keep testifying then and believing that if becoming that and remaining there that's a walls that's broken down but instead you should say no I love to pray I have a powerful and supernatural prayer life God loves to hear my voice my prayers change things I know what God wants done with his word because you do because you're his bride he enjoys spending time with you hallelujah number two always seeking the approval of others may this is one of my weaknesses just so you know and it's something that the Lord has dealt with so much I'll be through many many trials trust me I was not appreciated as a child now I'm not testifying like this is not coming out of me I'm listed at some of the thoughts that and the things that you can well on but even though they might have been your circumstance they might have been how you were raised and it could have been a most of us were raised very negative because our parents raised us like the appearance and their parents like beard and they came out of the Dark Age and so it's Babylonian and it's all ruined with all sorts of rubbish so we're all in the same boat nearly some of us might have been raised good amen god bless you you must be good on the path you know but I'm sure your medals is the same in other areas amen but anyway I was not appreciated as a child even when successful or victorious I was never good enough this is things that were told I was rejected by the popular group at school I watched a lot of Disney and Hollywood programs that promoted popularity and acting the part to be cool and popular I was only ever criticized by my parents you see you can hold to that testimony but that's just sandstone that stuff that you cannot build your life off and if you continue holding to those things they will keep you as a bad self-image and keep you on the ground they'll keep you away from being able to really fellowship and and actually let your gift come to its full glory because you see it and this is the temptation of sanballat trying to make you keep your life and you see it's like a drive and people I always need to be at seek approval of other people and so it's like this Drive and you you know as a Christian you don't want that and yet it's down in the subconscious and the other guy's driving the ship and it just seems to happen and even when you're doing stuff it's like these thoughts just roll around are you going to think this is quite good and it's actually going to earn me some credibility you know what in the Christian world you don't need to earn one but a credibility God as your counselor God as your manager God is your marketing have you need marketing to go and help somebody or whatever it may be not that it's marketing but you get I mean you're not going to market you but you know what I mean like he's going to he'll put you on someone's huh I need a speak with you or they need to go and preach it my they you know whatever it may be God does the organizing like that hallelujah now we can all if we continue thinking on those things and dwelling on those thoughts and maybe they actually happen but you don't need to remain under that identity that is not your true identity remember you were born in the muck but you came up through that mucking it up out to the bum of the pond and now by the Lord's grace and what he has made you he likens you to a beautiful lily and that lily is actually produced by the Holy Ghost within the beauty of that lily is actually the Holy Ghost life that was placed than you and cause you to bloom you don't need to make it happen you don't need to hear that's your true identity start actually thinking on your real here at regime which is Bible which is the Eternity it just is real and start confessing you know and these are just suggestions you neither have to but these you God might give you something else because when say this thought oh I was never good enough and then when you drop something on just so useless I can never do it I can never do anything right it always just goes to custard those are the sort of testimonies that because of your upbringing and what your parents always said to you those are sort you might not say it you might not get angry but it might just be an underlying thought you know what I am satisfied with who God made me I don't need the approval of man or woman my identity is in the Holy Ghost I'm just suggesting things here just to get your because these are practical things and I do encourage you to actually when you when things arise and you actually can identify these issues that you face in your life this is practical and this was not easy like because just remember it's ingrained in your habits you do this and then that always happens and you say this and you think this about yourself and all those things that's been going on all your life and now finally God's shedding light on how to get rid of it so now it's time it's time to actually put these things into full action but before you do it make the decision that you're going to go right through to the end and this is going to be your life from now your lifestyle I'm not going to dwell on the old past testimonies and actually when it rises up you say Lord is that is that all of that or is there more of that involved in that whole thought process and ask the Lord to show you and then whatever it comes out write it down these thoughts about yourself write them down so you can see it and then you can renounce that and you can say Lord take that out of my life and find the opposite rather fantasy do the opposite and I'm telling you to say the opposite say that if you get a thought I was never good enough you say no I don't need the approval of men a woman God's made me who I am I am bust because God made me this way and you see God's developing who you really are and there might be lots of faults right now but you're coming into that image you will be who you really are and this is one of the mysteries I believe revealed in this message is that the revelation of who you really are that you can be you and as you are able to be you are outside of legalism you can actually develop but if you're stuck under the pressure of a legalistic mentality and the real you can't be expressed and it's an freedom and it's just caged down down down you just saw you've got to just let yourself out you know obviously within reason you don't want to be unruly or anything but you see that's being under the right leadership in your own life don't rule yourself of the rod of iron but allow God to lead you in love deep down I want to prove myself to God I want to earn something from him and this is sandstone I was left to raise myself as a child parents never spent quality time with me and pushed me away for their own interests I was never shown love from my family I was always using privileges due to behavior I was always having possessions taken away due to performance as a young child you see these things yes there are ways to discipline your children of thought but you see now when it's just always and just hard and you'll just drop brought up like that you know you can develop these thoughts about yourself and you can always you end up trying to earn something from God end up it's very hard for people that have these types of sandstone testimonies to be able to receive a free gift to be able to receive the Holy Ghost these people that have these problems and these things happened in their past and they can't receive the Holy Ghost until it's dealt with that's happened but instead when these things start to come up this is the real testimony this is the rock that your walls need to be rebuilt with I believe God's grace is sufficient I already possess the title deed of creation I am a co here with Christ his sick that has been extended towards me and grace I am on speaking terms with God these are all suggestions yeah but these are the things that you can say in the light of all those thoughts coming about yourself you know when you might get under a real battle under a real cloud sometimes and that Devils trying to crush you down and push you to to do stuff you know what just start saying the breath take those rocks that are lying down in your life I believe God's grace is sufficient let that rock come and form the wall of your life don't just let some old mentality influence you I am a co here with Christ inside I want to shout and praise God and laugh but something always holds me back and I bottle it up I was always and these are some of the sandstone testimony of the reason why people can get in such a way I was always told to be quiet in church I was laughed at and completely embarrassed one time when I lifted my hands or shouted in church my parents thought I was making it up but I was seriously praising God and you know there could have been times in your life when that happen and it caused you to just retract down and then you spend your whole life not able to praise and maybe a light being shed on something it could be there but these are this is this is just a very hypothetical ample but suits don't hard Oh men and just see because we should be lifting our hands in church and having a good time there's no reason not to it's not the stupid conservative New Zealand culture away with it don't identify yourself avec amen let your arms rise name it and if they don't rise there's something wrong I really believe it because there is part of worship to actually be able to worship and you know there's some people that are quiet peace of course there's nothing wrong with being quiet or you know but that you'll find that when the Lord comes down they start moving amen they start getting a bit drunk and they start doing things that they would normally do amen hallelujah but then there's some people that will have trouble and they don't know why but these are some of the things that could have happened I was told as a child you're being too clean a costume well that would only be in a message Church but well maybe in a you know but you see now you know when these thoughts come you can actually actually override those thoughts with light and this is a light that can shine on the darkness and put it out I can express myself my true self freely I enjoy praising God with all my heart say it over brother bands have repeated over of those thoughts are troubling you or if something gets identified and you and you need oh lord help me I want to get away from that mentality I want to get away from that way I don't want to be held back at my own subconscious from being able to worship Lord shine your light upon my life so that I can see it these our prayers that I pray Lord o God why do I do this why am I like this and I know it's not really a good trait and eventually the little show he will but then you know how do you you can pray and you can ask the Lord to help you and free you and maybe you get freed instantly and sometimes you need to just start testify the opposite sometimes you need to just start doing the opposite as brother Branham said amen to get rid of something you do the answer through something opposite or say the opposite and this is in this case I'm dealing with confession tonight so there's a rock confession because your confession is a stone I mean I can express myself freely throw that stone at the devil I enjoy praising God with all my heart save that stone at the devil and then I am free to shout and praise God throw that stone at the devil in Amen it might happen when you're in church one day and you're sitting there and that very complex is overwhelming you and the Holy Ghost is movie you know and you know some that one day is just going to break and you're just going to go hallelujah amen hallelujah and it will be broken forever Amen that might be for somebody I don't know it might not be in here but Amen hallelujah you see how we need to be free Saints amen to do whatever God puts on our heart to do hey we don't any channel this club double o'clock as well as we see we want the Holy Ghost of flow and since we're all got gifts in our life and they need to be functioning and all their glory so that God gets all the glory got some men please or or some guy trying to prove himself or some person this will press down to schedule a good but for it to be free amen that's not taking those stones and storing them in the devil hallelujah baby I struggled to open up my true heart to anyone and struggle with human leadership I have been hurt by those I love most I have had a partner leave me for another I was raised by a paranoid and trusting family I was always told if you want it done right do it yourself you know these are these are horrible mentalities this ania huh I have to say but you know I've been raised up under some of these things I'm sure a lot of us here as well sayings that your parents just caught a hold of it they thought sounded good and they said they you know they called you then well they spoke that over your life and they've gotten great in your subconscious and now you know it might have been repressed you might not even but there might be a certain lifestyle practice there that you don't know why and it could be just a little saying that your parents sent over you when you were young you know what with those thoughts start coming at you you throw these stones into people I can trust my husband the wife with my whole heart you know that sounds like it's just for two simple doesn't it but it's not you start saying it the thought comes and you know I'm not saying there might only thing sometimes you really hit a pretty where you do if you need a breakthrough but identifies the little thing in your life and you need to pray through but you see sometimes this still the memories or the habits that are surrounding that and when those thoughts starts are coming better at you or let's try to raise the head again know I can trust my husband and model my wife with all my heart it's just a testimonial and this testimony is a stoner you can throw at the devil there you go I can trust the leadership in my life I'm safe to love and trust my church family with my strength all of that what's struggle to open up do the opposite my car gets all the brain and all the subconscious and every all the bells are whistling and all the alarms are going and everything just you now you know that it's right to do the opposite this is where your dominion is going to be tested this is where can you tape reverse your ol s through love in love because the motive is love the motive is I don't want that anymore I've received the profit that taught me if I do the opposite it will change and things would really change and some of you know I encourage that you might not be able to open up to the church or trust anybody with your whole heart anymore remember that it might also come to a reflection in your relationship with God and not only the church so you have to be very careful now when we're faced with these things I can open up and become vulnerable to my eternal family and you can because we all love each other there's no judgment or no we're not going to scorn your jeer at you we're actually growing together and so by opening up we love that because we know we're growing and you know the the the weakest and the strongest not that you put measurements on people but just for an example those strongest is not just running off yeah I'm the fastest of the stronger sir know that if they've really got God in them they're actually right behind the weakness they actually praying for the young ones and new ones the pray for the ones that are sitting on the fence they're praying for the one they desire to see us all free completely they desire us this is we desire us to be all completely free and so that's why we can confess our confess to each other and be free to when we have fellowship fellowship is not just to talk about the news or talk about the weather or talk about the rugby whatever we want to talk about fellowship was actually for iron to sharpen is it's a it's a it's a divine appointment you know when I have fellowship with anybody Bronwyn and I we've really pray with all our hearts Lord let this be any have eternal perspective or eternal value you know it's fun yes we have a bit of fun and we talk and we have a laugh and whatever but you know there's always we want to have that fellowship where where God is sitting with us you know and we start talking about heavenly things email and you'll find that you can open up to each other and do the opposite it might go against your grain because you might have had a past that has the sandstone testimony but remember as the pressure comes on that sandstone is going to crush down to powder those old testimonies those old stones you think that near mire and all of them when they were searching through the stones didn't find some sand and find some mud then fine rubbish that's what Sanballat was mocking them this rubbish all around these walls how are you going to get it all are you going to revive those stones and I say yes all those stones all those testimonies these rock testimonies of your life let your life now when I say this with your mouth right right this is not just with your mouth I can trust my husband and wife with my whole heart not just with your mouth yes that's a good start but with your life worth your life and it might take you to do the opposite these testimonies remember I see that the start is not just a verbal testimony it's your life my life says I trust the leadership in my life amen I am safe to love and trust my church family do it he that heareth these sayings and doeth them I will liken a wise man to build his house upon the rock where's that rock it's inside you your life's being built by the very rock of Christ Alleluia I fear to allow my gifts to be used I find it extremely embarrassing and I don't enjoy it remember so it's that this is just general so it might not be it might be partially it might be fully it might be more or less it's just a generalization but you know these are these are common homes I ought now this is this is a sandstone I was always told to stop being proud when I was used by God I have been told it may be the devil using my gift and it might not just be a human telling you they're Devils can tell you that two thoughts come saying I am too insignificant for God to use me I was never entrusted by my parents to accomplish things so these are experiences that could have happened in your life I was never allowed to help my parents with important duties once my gift was being used but I felt resentment so I don't want it to be offensive I want to be offensive you know and these tiny little things tiny it can be so small can block your gift from being used by a little thing and you know we're very sensitive especially now you get closer and closer to each other and so it can take the smallest thing to hurt each other and it might not be a big giant just a tiny little thing like a funny look and if you actually take offense to that it can be not offense as much as a as a as a all maybe they maybe I was wrong or and yet you were perfectly right your gift was coming into operation but you perceived it wrong you perceived it through a filter that you made a filter of a complex that you make an imagination possibly or maybe the person was looking at you like that and maybe they've got a problem but it's not them they might have been having a hard day they might have just been staring and often another dimension and looking it and you might not you see always give the benefit of the doubt yes always if you don't you'll take everything the wrong way on always give the benefit of the doubt and if it really is troubling contour seriously don't hold off for six months because there would be six months where your gift might not be an operation where you might and you might be a musician up here or whatever and you're just playing naturally the gift is out because these complexes but when your gift can be clean and actually in the complexes freed when it get we're neck ATAR with that drama with that piano I'm going to hit the name every us right now when it plays the gift is operating in God's coming out you know this freedom whatever gift that may be you know you see these gifts are sensitive because it's God it's the Holy Ghost the timid dove that comes and operates the gifts and so if your complexed up and you built up these little walls you see it's very hard for the Dove to come and come through that because he can't he just can't it has to be pure I can now these are this is the rock throw these stones in there I'm sorry it's going so long I express my gifts and it brings people to Jesus Christ I yield my gifts to Jesus Christ I am pleased to see God using my gift now really we don't own the gift it's God I'm just saying that because it isn't new and so I see God's grace gave it to you and he said you can call it yours and you know what God gave you the Holy Ghost and he gave you life and he said you can God gave you a predestined seed and he gave you the he actually loves you so much that he said you can call it yours as your seed you are as you how are you he gave it to you so you he loves you so much so he's actually put that gift in your life and it's your gifting and you'll tell him now it's actually life or death to whether you can whether that talent can operate because remember the man that got received the one talent they had a complex that was all complex down and all too scared just in case he lost it or something Jesus did not deal wery well with that man didn't he that man hatch Lee went through condemnation because he didn't that gift there were there is grace enough to free us from every complex so that all our gifts can come into full operation because as they come into operation and their fullness don't be fearful don't be scared and if there is scare or fear talk it over with them talk it over see the pasta whatever you need to do anyone company's open up be free we love you we love a men I am pleased to see God using my gift the gift in my life is gone on display click this is the last one I fear commitment and always step back when faced with a voice to commit and these are some of the things why reasons why I have been dumped by partners soon after I gave my heart to him I was always told I would never amount to much I was always told I wasn't the sharpest tool in the sheet now that might sound like a little funny thing you say to your children but I wouldn't say it Oh seriously I wouldn't say that and I don't think any of us would you know I'm sure many of us were told that or maybe I was you guys are probably smart but I was told a few things my parents divorced now remember this is not much is funny but these are these are things that can actually cause trouble now the rock of that as commitment is a joy to me I can do all things through Christ I can trust people that God gives me you've got or just now I'm only saying it so you can actually think over your own life it's just to trigger some force I'm not saying this is you or anyone these are just to actually shed some light on situation unable to experience or understand divine love that's missing the love but exposure to abuse of parents or partners where you open your heart and it was abused exposure to a mother who was abused by your father or stepfather etc exposure to fear-mongering regarding marriage or commitment I was told you would not make a good husband or wife you see these things and most of the time more often than not that what's on a natural level with your relationship with fellow men and partners and husbands and wives is actually going to ultimately reflect your relationship with God and either hinder it or help and now sandstone is going to hinder it it's not my foundation but the rock musicians can come please this is it I love Jesus Christ with all my heart you know and I think that you know there is this room for us all to come to a deeper understanding of God's divine love brother Branham said that in the Garden of Eden before the fall Adam and Eve had a perfect understanding of gods of God love had a perfect understanding of it experienced that they lived in it now I think that you know we're coming into that further and further and more and more I love Jesus Christ with all my heart and I say this every morning over and over in my own and as I'm praying I think we all do I always testifying how much I love them and theirs you know and for me because I my upbringing was hard and not communicated we never told each other we loved the my family and so for me to actually to feel God's love and experience God's love it's taken a long time and I'm still probably not where I'm definitely not where I should be but I want to be there and so for me by telling by constantly telling him how much I love him and thinking on what he's done for me that's generating that love I'm pondering over I'm thinking about it being thankful and thinking over why I'm thankful and but in actually expressing the gratitude and saying yes thank you all I can express my love and word indeed I am greatly loved by my family I am greatly loved by God and this is the final scripture that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing that is in you so I encourage your saints take those stones that are all laying down and maybe you know we're on the last level layer of the wall I don't you know we could be right there and you know I believe we are very close so we might be on the top level at all the gates maybe you're getting done right now but whatever it may be let the communication the expression of your faith will become a fictional as you acknowledge every good thing so take every stone that may be laying there and let no stone be unturned but take every stone and turn it and acknowledge it and say yes this is who I really am and this is a stone this is not a sandstone and I'm going to let this become the walls of my Jerusalem amen god bless you hallelujah let's sing what's that song has anyone got a song yeah search my heart Oh God amen god bless you and this is the final Wednesday night so they'll be back down to 45 our sermons again I want to scare you away but I'm sure faith doesn't when you've got real faith you know nothing scares you away hate me
