[43:27] whom they shall serve will I judge and
[43:30] afterwards shall they come out with
[43:32] great substance and thou shall go to thy
[43:34] father's and peace thou shalt be buried
[43:36] in a good old age but in the fourth
[43:38] generation they shall come hither again
[43:40] for the iniquity of the EM rights is not
[43:42] yet full and it came to pass that when
[43:44] the Sun went down and it was dark will
[43:46] hold a burning furnace and a burning
[43:47] lamp that passed between those pieces
[43:49] and the same day that the Lord made a
[43:52] covenant with Abraham saying unto thy

[45:39] read the next verse and the fruits that
[45:40] thy soul lusted after I departed from
[45:43] thee and all things that were dainty and
[45:46] goodly are departed from thee and thou
[45:48] shalt find them no more at all amen may
[45:51] the Lord bless his word you may have
[45:53] have your seats this morning I like to
[45:55] speak about God's covenant with us now
[45:57] we read here in in Genesis 15 where God
[46:00] as God as giving a God as he's he's he's
[46:04] making a covenant with Abraham and we
[46:06] know when a covenant was made and in the
[46:08] Old Testament times that there would be
[46:10] an animal would be slain there would be
[46:12] an agreement would be made and and thus
[46:15] land animal will signify your both
[46:18] parties agreeing that if they cannot
[46:20] keep or do not keep the words of that
[46:22] covenant that they would be like that
[46:24] slain animal that's how they were
[46:26] pledging one to another and so we know
[46:29] God gave a time Adam and Eve the first
[46:31] conditional covenant you know don't eat
[46:33] of the tree the day you eat thereof that
[46:35] you know that day they shall die and as
[46:37] you know you know it was on condition
[46:38] and we know that man fell but God God
[46:42] began to even even in the judgment when
[46:45] when God was giving judgment to Adam and
[46:47] even the serpent
[46:50] they're in the garden he gave him an
[46:51] unconditional covenant that the seed of
[46:53] the woman would come and crush the head
[46:55] of the seed of the serpent and that was
[46:56] unconditional now God would God would
[46:59] show to to Abraham you know we we read
[47:02] here that that you know he he was bought
[47:04] out of the ear of the Chaldees so he
[47:06] wasn't from Babylon and God took him out
[47:08] of Babylon I'm you know he heard his
[47:11] voice and God told him to depart out of
[47:13] this country and he did he followed the
[47:15] voice of God not knowing where he was
[47:16] going to go but then God gave her may
[47:19] God gave him a sign that has that that
[47:22] the land then he promised would be his
[47:25] and hers and his children's and it was a
[47:27] it was a definite sign it wasn't just a
[47:29] nice idea it wasn't just some nice words
[47:31] but God gave a physical evidence by the
[47:34] sacrifices and God passes passing
[47:37] through the midst of them consuming them
[47:38] that this was God giving his covenant to
[47:40] Abraham that God was gonna give his
[47:43] children the land that God was gonna do
[47:45] it God was gonna place him in their
[47:46] inheritance it wasn't their doing it was
[47:48] God gonna do it and and and as I said in
[47:51] the opening remarks it and when we when
[47:53] two people would make a covenant they'd
[47:54] say if we do not uphold our into the
[47:56] bargain we will be like the slate animal
[47:58] that we have just killed I mean as a
[48:00] promise so now if God promises that he's
[48:03] going to do something then he's gonna do
[48:05] it I mean he cannot fail he cannot you
[48:07] know back up and what he has promised
[48:09] you know he says no I'm gonna do it and
[48:10] he puts everything all of his energies
[48:12] all of his power all of us might all
[48:15] that he is he actually joins himself to
[48:17] a people saying I am gonna give you what
[48:19] I promised you what I have given you in
[48:22] my word I will perform it to you amen
[48:24] and I cannot fail I cannot be you know I
[48:27] cannot fail I know you cannot do it
[48:29] hallelujah that's why when Jesus was
[48:32] hanging on Calvary you know your brother
[48:34] BAM says that God was riding a covenant
[48:36] with the families of the earth
[48:37] hallelujah so because he knew we could
[48:39] never do it we could never be perfect as
[48:41] our Father and heaven is perfect
[48:43] I mean so he became the slate animal he
[48:45] became our sacrifice I mean that his
[48:48] life would come upon us and we could
[48:49] actually manifest or fulfill I mean what
[48:52] God would have us do in this day Ilia so
[48:55] you know but I just want to read there
[48:57] from from revelations 18 because this
[48:59] great beasts power this this Mystery
[49:01] Babylon which is controlling the earth
[49:03] I mean it trades in the souls of men so
[49:05] not just in commodities not just in oil
[49:08] and precious things and you know your
[49:10] stock markets and money whatever more
[49:12] business all these things but it's the
[49:13] soul of men that are that are being
[49:15] traded slaves and the souls of men and
[49:17] we know that you know slavery is very
[49:19] much alive today I mean not just not
[49:22] just what we would call slavery like any
[49:24] you know you know your North and South
[49:26] America how they used to have slaves but
[49:28] people are still slaves I mean but the
[49:30] but but the you know the devil's
[49:32] greatest trick as if he can get you to
[49:35] believe that he is not real he has won
[49:38] because of the enemy any enemy that that
[49:41] gets the opposing force to think they
[49:44] are not working they're not active you
[49:46] know they have won the war like if just
[49:48] say you know we know that every nation
[49:49] has spies amen
[49:52] every nation has spies we have spies you
[49:55] know America's got spies Russia's got
[49:57] spies but imagine if we were you know
[50:00] what about what if we thought well
[50:02] there's no spies in this country well
[50:05] then they could come and they could do
[50:06] all this buying they could steal our
[50:07] secrets they could go because we
[50:09] wouldn't be watching out to try and
[50:11] protect what we have against the spice
[50:13] right so so if the enemy being you know
[50:15] tries to get us think well he's not real
[50:17] he's not working it's all in the
[50:19] people's minds it's just a figment of
[50:21] imagination to control people you know
[50:23] the devil's not really real he's got you
[50:25] I mean then he can really work and he
[50:28] can deal but if you can if you can
[50:30] identify your enemy and withstand him
[50:32] but the first thing is you got to
[50:34] identify you enemy so now he says here
[50:36] that the that that this system has made
[50:39] made slaves and it also trades the souls
[50:42] of men and I was thinking you know that
[50:45] you know every every year I guess you
[50:47] know you know and base it well not not
[50:50] every year in some sports but you know
[50:51] in America there's the draft for the
[50:53] basketball and different different great
[50:55] leagues of your sport and and and people
[50:57] get traded players get sold they get
[51:00] bought they get traded around what's
[51:01] happening there's there's people trading
[51:04] and and and and the sports teams they
[51:07] don't really care about the player they
[51:09] just want to make money from the player
[51:11] that's all they care about why does why
[51:14] does a great brand you know sign someone
[51:16] to
[51:17] - - you know some advertising you know
[51:20] contract with a great player they don't
[51:22] really care about the play they're just
[51:23] using that player to make money amen
[51:26] whoa what's happening they're trading
[51:28] people to actually get benefit out of
[51:30] that person if that person can no longer
[51:32] play like they used to can no longer
[51:34] perform no longer as famous they just
[51:37] get contracts over goodbye what's
[51:40] happening they're being traded amen and
[51:42] the devil wants to trade you he'll give
[51:45] you a kingdom he came to Jesus said if
[51:47] you just bow down and worship me I'll
[51:49] give you all the kingdoms of the world I
[51:50] mean and it's the value you take a very
[51:53] famous player in the world there can be
[51:55] hundreds of millions of dollars for a
[51:57] contract because that's the value that
[51:59] the sports teams put on a certain star
[52:01] but if he's not very good well then
[52:03] within his value will go down very low
[52:05] so the devil will try and give you a
[52:07] kingdom amen it may be a very small
[52:11] kingdom you may just have an influence
[52:13] over a few people or something you know
[52:15] you know but he will try and buy you
[52:17] we're not but the Bride of Christ cannot
[52:20] be bought I mean we cannot be traded we
[52:23] can't be swapped I mean by some spirit
[52:26] for one spirit to another spirit from
[52:27] another you know we're not here to be
[52:29] traded because we've been called out
[52:31] hallelujah we've been caught by the
[52:33] voice of God in this day out of that
[52:35] system hallelujah amen so so we're not
[52:38] here to be treated hallelujah amen I
[52:43] just I was just happy thinking about
[52:44] that I mean I'm not for I'm not for sale
[52:47] I've been bought I can't be traded I
[52:49] can't be pawned off I can't be whatever
[52:52] because I'm bought with a price the
[52:53] blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[52:57] but you've got to recognize you know but
[52:59] he has to make that covenant with you no
[53:02] no brother base isn't Israel in Egypt a
[53:04] 1953 season God showed Abraham what he
[53:07] was going to do that through the seed of
[53:08] Isaac he'd bring forth his only begotten
[53:10] Son Christ and was slain yonder between
[53:13] heavens and earth when the Sun went down
[53:15] the blackness over the earth and there
[53:16] he tore him apart he pulled his soul out
[53:19] of him and he wrote a covenant with the
[53:20] families of the earth where when their
[53:22] precious and adulterated blood of
[53:24] Almighty God drip from Emmanuel's veins
[53:26] he tore that soul out of him he cried my
[53:28] God my God why has thou forsaken me
[53:31] his face was full of mockery split a
[53:32] crown of cruel mockery pulled down over
[53:34] his brow his nails drove with Roman
[53:37] spikes
[53:38] his back was Riven until his ribs show
[53:40] through swinging on the cross screaming
[53:42] dying sinners death the sin of the world
[53:44] upon him and their God Rivard his side
[53:47] stole her soul out of him then he said
[53:48] into thy hands I commend my spirit and
[53:50] he dropped his head the earth shook and
[53:52] belch out its rocks there he is there's
[53:55] God's covenant there's the fulfilling of
[53:57] it hallelujah amen now no seas on the
[54:01] wings of a dove he says now what God is
[54:03] showing him here is this on these
[54:05] sacrifices of speaking of Christ that's
[54:07] how God took Jesus to to the Calvary and
[54:10] tore him apart and received the body up
[54:12] and to heaven sin the spirit down upon
[54:14] us that the same spirit that was on him
[54:16] has to be on you to dovetail with the
[54:19] body to be the bride at the end time see
[54:21] that's right won't be a denomination now
[54:23] it'll be the word what he was but like
[54:26] the word has to come to the word like
[54:28] cell and a human being you know that
[54:29] your body's being built it isn't one
[54:31] cell of a human mix of a pig mixed of a
[54:34] dog oh no no it's all human cell that's
[54:36] the way the body of Christ does all the
[54:39] Word of God not just part of it some
[54:40] tradition added to it no it's all the
[54:42] body of Christ as a word upon word upon
[54:46] word and when we're being built under
[54:48] the statue of the perfect man word upon
[54:50] word upon word I mean not human cell not
[54:53] hybrid not not man's ideas not tradition
[54:56] of man no it's word upon word upon word
[54:59] holy that's why you've got to see the
[55:01] value of reading you're reading the
[55:02] Bible listening to the message being in
[55:04] prayer coming to church you're being
[55:06] built up word upon word upon word build

[55:13] achieve when you hang on Calvary might
[55:15] be manifested in my life hallelujah amen
[55:18] build me up grow me up Oh Lord
[55:20] hallelujah I mean because we know that
[55:23] God's God wrote a covenant with the
[55:24] families of the earth that he would take
[55:26] himself and multiplied himself into a
[55:28] people and me to produce himself and
[55:30] human beings I mean that what he was the
[55:33] Living Word of God will be manifested in
[55:35] the people hallelujah that's why he died
[55:37] wasn't I'm gonna make more of myself I'm

[58:18] thing
[58:19] hallelujah glory to God I'm glad I know

[58:34] mean if Abraham could have you know sat
[58:36] next to Moses because Moses you know you

[59:12] said are you right that but that was a
[59:14] great moment you know it's just a few 25
[59:17] years of life it's condensed down just
[59:19] to you know into a few chapters just
[59:22] like highlights basically that's what
[59:24] God wanted you to know yeah everyone

[1:00:17] he doesn't pick up those things he
[1:00:19] doesn't pick up the failures he doesn't
[1:00:21] pick up the struggles he doesn't pick
[1:00:23] win-win when God came to him said you're
[1:00:24] gonna be the father of many nations and
[1:00:26] he rolls down a you know in front of God
[1:00:28] and laughs he laughs at the promise of
[1:00:31] God and in God's face he's laughing at
[1:00:33] him he's read that you know it wasn't
[1:00:37] you Syria that laughed
[1:00:38] Abraham was laughing Abraham had been
[1:00:41] called and God had done many mighty
[1:00:43] things I'm gonna make you father of
[1:00:45] nations and he rolls at his feet you or
[1:00:49] think God would have been offended it
[1:00:52] didn't stop God God didn't change his
[1:00:54] mind
[1:00:54] I can't work with the sky anymore I
[1:00:56] bought him this far but neither so I
[1:00:58] gotta find someone else no God was
[1:01:00] determined because he made an
[1:01:02] unconditional covenant with the man just
[1:01:04] like he made an unconditional covenant
[1:01:06] with you
[1:01:06] hallelujah but then when the Apostle
[1:01:08] Paul was writing down the commentary of
[1:01:10] Abraham's life he said he staggered not
[1:01:12] at the promise of God but was strong in
[1:01:14] faith giving praise to him fully
[1:01:16] frustrated that he would do it wholly a
[1:01:18] row Romans chapter 4 Amen why because
[1:01:22] the blood of Jesus Christ erases all
[1:01:24] that part I'm glad that the blood erases
[1:01:27] boots holy all the bad bits we're not
[1:01:29] proud off the blood takes care of it
[1:01:31] I mean he was wounded for our
[1:01:33] transgressions we had a lot of
[1:01:34] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:01:36] iniquities we had a lot of iniquity and
[1:01:38] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:01:40] him and by His stripes we are healed
[1:01:42] hallelujah amen so you know you know the
[1:01:47] devil comes against you you know always
[1:01:49] your humanity you did this and you did
[1:01:51] this and you did this and you did it you
[1:01:54] were there when it happened yeah you
[1:01:58] could agree you say yes devil yes yes
[1:02:00] yes but then you gotta say no no hold on
[1:02:03] that's not the end of the story that's
[1:02:05] not the end of the story I'm a child of
[1:02:08] the kingdom my father when I say my
[1:02:10] father which art in heaven I'm not just
[1:02:12] repeating words just just out of my mind
[1:02:14] I know who my father is
[1:02:16] I know who my hair belief hallelujah I
[1:02:19] know who my maker is it is God
[1:02:22] and the blood of jesus christ takes care
[1:02:24] of all those things you know that's why
[1:02:26] the word is written in such a way he was
[1:02:28] bruised for our iniquities amen amen he
[1:02:33] was wounded for our transgressions that
[1:02:35] covers everything I mean the
[1:02:37] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:02:39] hallelujah and with the stripes were
[1:02:41] healed it that just covers everything
[1:02:44] Amen hallelujah glory I think we can
[1:02:47] just dance out of here right now
[1:02:49] hallelujah isn't that wonderful I mean
[1:02:51] but that's what this message makes alive
[1:02:54] hallelujah amen so I mean and today so
[1:03:01] God has made a covenant with the peoples
[1:03:02] of the earth and conditional covenant he
[1:03:04] has to keep her side of the Covenant and
[1:03:07] he will and he does and today this is in
[1:03:11] the token from shreveport 63 and today
[1:03:13] the Holy Ghost is God's covenant with
[1:03:15] God's covenant people the Holy Ghost the
[1:03:17] life of the resurrected Christ has got
[1:03:20] to be displayed in the church amongst
[1:03:22] the people making him the same yesterday
[1:03:24] today and forever no matter how loyal a
[1:03:27] member you are you might be whatever you
[1:03:29] may be a good man or a good woman that
[1:03:31] is sure is fine we appreciate that but
[1:03:34] only the token will will keep you alive
[1:03:36] God's token you might be a student of
[1:03:39] the Bible you might be a good person you
[1:03:41] might even be the president you would be
[1:03:44] anything you want to be there's no
[1:03:45] excuses when God started the exodus from
[1:03:47] Egypt calling out Israel from Egypt to
[1:03:50] his promised land there was there was no
[1:03:52] excuse every man had to display the
[1:03:55] blood and today the Exodus is calling
[1:03:57] out of the systems into the bride no
[1:04:00] matter how much system urine it still
[1:04:02] requires the token of the life of Jesus
[1:04:04] Christ again nothing else will work
[1:04:06] still the token is required it remained
[1:04:08] no matter if he was a loyal man he might
[1:04:10] have been the Pharaoh of Egypt and he
[1:04:14] was the most important man of the day
[1:04:15] but the token had to be applied to him
[1:04:18] no matter how important he was whether
[1:04:20] he was a bishop a priest whatever a
[1:04:22] president King potentate monarch that
[1:04:25] had nothing to do that God only required
[1:04:27] the I mean God only recognized the token
[1:04:29] the Covenant people same thing today the
[1:04:32] Holy Ghost I mean the Holy Spirit will
[1:04:34] only recognize the Covenant people we
[1:04:36] find that death was ready to strike
[1:04:38] Egypt at any time now God has showed had
[1:04:41] showed them his grace his power and his
[1:04:44] signs hallelujah
[1:04:46] so God only recognizes those that have
[1:04:49] the Holy Ghost amen outside of that
[1:04:52] we're lost I mean but God only gives the
[1:04:56] Holy Spirit to us covenant people
[1:04:58] hallelujah amen isn't that wonderful
[1:05:01] Amy but you see now that we are living
[1:05:04] in this Exodus and this Exodus is very
[1:05:06] vital that the blood must be applied the
[1:05:09] token must be on display the life of God
[1:05:11] will what do you mean by that
[1:05:13] the life of God must be living in you he
[1:05:15] must be living out of your life amen
[1:05:17] that is more than just words on paper
[1:05:19] more than just quoting more than just
[1:05:21] memories Amen you're you're remembering
[1:05:24] Scripture but the life of God must put
[1:05:26] on flesh in in you hallelujah and it's
[1:05:30] absolutely vital I mean but uh but I
[1:05:33] want you to recognize Amen at the life
[1:05:35] of God is in you nothing can stand
[1:05:37] against you I mean there's great value
[1:05:39] in applying the blood I mean there is
[1:05:41] great for absolute value in applying the
[1:05:43] blood you've got to look at the reason
[1:05:45] why you're doing it I mean in the valley
[1:05:47] if you find no value in having the life
[1:05:49] of God in you you'll never apply it I
[1:05:52] mean you'll never put it on display Amy
[1:05:54] but if you recognize the power of the
[1:05:56] Holy Ghost I mean that no weapon formed
[1:05:59] against you shall prosper every demon
[1:06:01] power must be trodden under your feet
[1:06:03] holy that nothing can stand against you

[1:06:42] applied they can never become an
[1:06:44] unbeliever I mean they can never walk
[1:06:46] and say there's nothing to it I don't
[1:06:47] care there's nothing there's
[1:06:49] no you can never become an unbeliever
[1:06:52] when the blood has been applied I mean
[1:06:54] when the life of God comes into you
[1:06:55] faith can never be taken from you it may
[1:06:57] be challenged there may be a war going
[1:07:00] on I mean but God is a conqueror
[1:07:02] God hasn't overcome him I mean our God
[1:07:05] is a God of War
[1:07:06] amen easily he is a God of peace but
[1:07:08] he's a God of War and he's never afraid
[1:07:10] of a challenge
[1:07:11] holler he loves a challenge I mean he
[1:07:14] loves faith to be challenged that's why
[1:07:17] he allows us to live in this evil age I
[1:07:19] mean that's why he called allows us to
[1:07:21] live in the darkest of ages I mean
[1:07:23] because he knows his blood will work I
[1:07:24] mean his covenant will hold I mean it
[1:07:27] will not break apart it will not
[1:07:29] dissolve I mean it will stand I mean it
[1:07:31] will overcome every condition of every
[1:07:33] age hallelujah and that's why he has
[1:07:36] confidence in his salvation hallelujah
[1:07:39] and that's why Jobe overcame he didn't
[1:07:41] understand what was going on you know in
[1:07:43] his life he didn't know why his children
[1:07:45] died and he lost everything is covered
[1:07:47] in boils but he was standing on the shed
[1:07:49] blood of the Lamb amen he knew to apply
[1:07:53] the blood he knew the value of offering
[1:07:56] the blood I mean not just for himself
[1:07:58] but for his children pre adventure that
[1:08:00] they may have sinned
[1:08:01] I mean he saw the value of it though he
[1:08:04] didn't know what happened in the next
[1:08:05] life though he didn't know those things
[1:08:07] but he applied the blood cuz he knew the
[1:08:10] value of it hallelujah and the value
[1:08:13] came back to show itself I mean when God
[1:08:16] came down in a whirlwind and spoke to
[1:08:18] him then joy began to see now I really
[1:08:21] recognize the value of applying the
[1:08:23] blood I mean it'll it'll it'll it'll pay
[1:08:26] back one of these days hallelujah and I
[1:08:31] just want to give you an announcement

[1:08:41] Revelation we're still walking in faith
[1:08:43] what the blood is playing off applying
[1:08:45] the blood paid off hallelujah and if

[1:12:04] I'm a holla we're called to win
[1:12:06] hallelujah the whole armour of God is
[1:12:08] supernatural
[1:12:09] amen as the baptism of the Holy Ghost as
[1:12:11] this mess is put on flesh hallelujah and
[1:12:14] everyone I believe that we have the
[1:12:15] whole armour of God we have the best
[1:12:17] equipment you just have to have
[1:12:19] confidence in your equipment amen
[1:12:22] hallelujah I have the best weapon I have
[1:12:25] the best armor hallelujah the best the
[1:12:30] best you know P you know people make up
[1:12:32] big science fiction stories that you
[1:12:34] know people go to travel to this galaxy
[1:12:36] to find this super weapon to overcome
[1:12:39] some great enemy we have the super
[1:12:40] weapon hallelujah and there's nothing
[1:12:43] can match it it doesn't need to be
[1:12:45] upgraded brother em says the entire
[1:12:47] message meets in time conditions and
[1:12:49] this word meets in time conditions
[1:12:51] police it does need to be upgraded
[1:12:53] doesn't need to be honed in it works
[1:12:55] it'll go to the killing place every time
[1:12:58] hallelujah it's more than laser-guided
[1:13:01] hallelujah amen
[1:13:04] you'll have confidence in your weapon
[1:13:05] have confidence in your armor
[1:13:08] I'll Lou you say they only recognize the
[1:13:11] token now we understand that death is
[1:13:13] riding in this age amen we're not
[1:13:16] ignorant to that that 4/4 horse you know
[1:13:19] rider yo we know when the bride goes up
[1:13:22] the devil comes down as incarnate takes
[1:13:25] full control but all the mechanics of
[1:13:27] that ride is already riding Holly under
[1:13:30] the fourth seal
[1:13:31] it's already writing I'm in death and
[1:13:33] pestilence all yo deception everything's
[1:13:35] riding it's here upon the earth any of
[1:13:38] our brother Aaron says when the bride
[1:13:39] goes up that's when the the devil comes
[1:13:41] down is full incarnate I mean that's
[1:13:43] when the death really rides hallelujah
[1:13:45] but now in order for death not to strike
[1:13:48] us the token must be applied I mean when
[1:13:51] brother Bram he preached the seals amen
[1:13:53] you know and and but then he saw because
[1:13:56] really what a minister should do and
[1:13:58] brother Branham says is that he should
[1:13:59] be studying out the weak points of his
[1:14:01] congregation in order to help them
[1:14:04] there's what he says I mean so so after
[1:14:07] the preaching of the seals he said now
[1:14:09] the people have to apply the token he
[1:14:12] said he said that was the capping off of
[1:14:13] his whole ministry I mean that the token
[1:14:16] would be applied I mean there is more
[1:14:18] than just because even the Apostle Paul
[1:14:20] would say in first Corinthians 13 though
[1:14:22] I know all mysteries but have not
[1:14:24] charity I have nothing though I give my
[1:14:26] body to be burned give all my goods to
[1:14:28] the poor though I have not charity
[1:14:29] divine love I am nothing I mean so so we
[1:14:33] can no woman so he says in that
[1:14:35] scripture you can know all mysteries but
[1:14:38] yet without the Holy Ghost earned you
[1:14:39] the token being applied you're nothing I
[1:14:41] mean so he actually says you can
[1:14:43] actually understand all things but yet
[1:14:45] not have the Holy Ghost amen and it
[1:14:49] actually makes it very easy these days
[1:14:50] we have such programs we have you know
[1:14:52] the best ministry that's ever struck the
[1:14:54] earth is on the internet you can go
[1:14:56] listen you can watch you can actually
[1:14:57] learn there revelation but yet without
[1:15:01] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:03] so now that's why he yo he said that the
[1:15:07] preaching the token message was the
[1:15:08] capping off it was the really the apex
[1:15:11] of us of his ministry was now the blood
[1:15:14] had to be applied I mean that now is
[1:15:16] more than just learning but now the life
[1:15:18] of God had to come into the people
[1:15:20] hallelujah you say well I have the token
[1:15:23] well I trust after this you you hold it
[1:15:25] a far greater value amen then then
[1:15:28] before you received it amen so now so so
[1:15:32] he would say that now is the time
[1:15:34] because death is death is striking the
[1:15:36] land
[1:15:37] I mean unbelievers yo brother BAM said
[1:15:39] the worst devil that there is his
[1:15:41] unbelief more than epilepsy more than
[1:15:44] cancer more
[1:15:44] some horrible disease it is unbelief is
[1:15:46] the most wicked devil I mean and that is
[1:15:49] the greatest one we fight against I mean
[1:15:52] as unbelief I'll say also fear amen but
[1:15:56] we shouldn't fear nothing
[1:15:57] hallelujah when when when Israel was was
[1:16:01] under the blood and Goshen and it was
[1:16:04] dark amen
[1:16:05] you know the firstborn brother been
[1:16:07] dramatized it you know first we'll say
[1:16:09] daddy is everything okay because we
[1:16:11] heard Moses saying that I you know the
[1:16:13] firstborns going to die if the blast not
[1:16:15] applied it's eight don't worry Sam look
[1:16:17] look at the door and lintel we've done
[1:16:20] everything that the word has told us to
[1:16:22] do I mean the blood has been applied to
[1:16:24] the door and then till the Lambs been
[1:16:25] sacrificed I mean we've done everything
[1:16:28] all the Levin's been swept out of the
[1:16:30] house hallelujah
[1:16:32] why is there a house weeping why does it
[1:16:34] need to be a house weeping time because
[1:16:36] because like Jesus said about the
[1:16:37] parable of the woman that just had you
[1:16:39] know she was missing a coin and then in
[1:16:42] those days instead of a wedding ring
[1:16:43] they had like ten coins or something up
[1:16:45] and they're here and that was showing
[1:16:46] that they were married and if you lost
[1:16:48] one you were no you weren't living pure

[1:20:51] also for Dane men for that age to
[1:20:54] fulfill that word every time he allotted
[1:20:56] his word he allotted a man for it when
[1:20:58] he allotted Moses time he lighted Moses
[1:21:00] to it when he lauded a time for the son
[1:21:03] of God to be born he allotted him to it
[1:21:05] every age he's loaded men foreordained
[1:21:07] as the Bible said he said if God is

[1:21:14] things from the beginning so he knowed
[1:21:16] and he says there's nothing out of cater
[1:21:19] so if God ordained this h-2b and a word

[1:25:42] have confidence and what God has made us
[1:25:45] to be I mean what this wood can do this
[1:25:49] word this message crew you know the same
[1:25:52] one that said let there be Sun Moon and
[1:25:53] stars spoke this message forth brother
[1:25:56] and said it wasn't me it's not my idea
[1:25:58] it's not my thoughts it says it's God's
[1:26:01] thoughts so I've had it has creative
[1:26:04] power in it hallelujah
[1:26:06] so the Creator spoke this word is that
[1:26:08] Alright ain't meant so now if this word
[1:26:11] has creative power nothing is greater
[1:26:13] than the Creator nothing can stand
[1:26:15] against the Creator the devil cannot
[1:26:17] create he can only prevent I mean that's
[1:26:20] why he takes your identity and try and
[1:26:22] perverts it when he tries to tell you
[1:26:24] you can never overcome you can never be
[1:26:26] victorious you miles will just accept
[1:26:27] your lot in life and sit back and accept
[1:26:29] it
[1:26:30] that's him perverting your identity and
[1:26:32] because the word says you're more than a
[1:26:34] conqueror through him that loved you
[1:26:35] holy oh we are overcomers that's our
[1:26:38] identity we are overcomers that's what
[1:26:40] we do that's what we're made to be
[1:26:42] hallelujah you take nature nature is
[1:26:45] governed by instinct a lion is always a
[1:26:48] lion amen it has an instinct as a lion
[1:26:51] it's a predator its aggressive you know
[1:26:52] doesn't
[1:26:53] it's not a rap no it's not a little
[1:26:55] bunny rabbit or a lamb amen
[1:26:59] it's a lion it's fish it can be raised
[1:27:01] by people but there's still that
[1:27:03] instinct in it and it can be triggered
[1:27:04] very easily it'll just go by their
[1:27:05] instinct and it'll be a lion because
[1:27:07] it's made to be a lion amen now we are
[1:27:11] not governed by instinct we're going by
[1:27:13] free will but if our free will is
[1:27:15] surrendered to God then what we're made
[1:27:17] to be will come out
[1:27:18] I mean we're made to be overcomers
[1:27:23] hallelujah that's what God has made you
[1:27:25] to be
[1:27:26] amen so if we're made to be overcomers
[1:27:28] we're going to have a challenge
[1:27:30] amen as I've said before an invincible
[1:27:32] army as an a bunch of people has just
[1:27:34] come out of basic training polished up
[1:27:36] weapons and and marching up and down the
[1:27:38] parade ground
[1:27:39] that's not invincible army they've never
[1:27:41] been tested they've never had they've
[1:27:43] never been in the battle they've never
[1:27:44] been under the pressure and the
[1:27:46] confusion of war they're never taken
[1:27:48] hits they've never been wounded they've
[1:27:50] never had battlefield experience but
[1:27:53] those that have had battlefield
[1:27:54] experience I mean an invincible army has
[1:27:57] fought battles and won amen and there's
[1:28:00] some generals in history that have never
[1:28:02] never lost a battle hallelujah and the
[1:28:06] one that really never lost it better was
[1:28:07] our King Jesus was our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:10] he has never ever lost a battle and he's
[1:28:13] not gonna lose the battle in this age
[1:28:15] why does the battle he fights all that
[1:28:18] the father has given me will come to me
[1:28:20] and all that country I'll no wise cast
[1:28:22] out I will not lose a part of myself
[1:28:25] he cannot it's impossible it's
[1:28:28] impossible for God to lose a part of
[1:28:30] himself like Adam the last act he did as
[1:28:33] God over the u.s. was try and redeem a
[1:28:34] part of himself he could not lose Eve
[1:28:37] because she was part of him hallelujah
[1:28:40] she was part of him I mean he had more
[1:28:42] ribs and evidently you can do an
[1:28:45] operation you can actually cut out a
[1:28:46] rubber a certain way it will grow back
[1:28:48] medical science has proven it but he had
[1:28:51] more ribs but he had no more feminist
[1:28:53] part of himself so he couldn't lose a
[1:28:55] part of himself it means he was willing
[1:28:57] to forfeit god ship over the earth for
[1:28:59] part of himself for the one he loved
[1:29:02] hallelujah that's like our Lord Jesus I
[1:29:05] mean he put on human flesh
[1:29:07] came down from the poles of glory became
[1:29:10] a man for you for love love brought him
[1:29:13] to the earth hallelujah love born to the
[1:29:16] earth I mean it speaks about an ax
[1:29:18] chapter one about how after his passion
[1:29:20] he was shown alive wet licious this just
[1:29:23] got x1 shall we they maybe we'll find a
[1:29:29] place to quit he says here now X X 1 & 3
[1:29:40] to whom also he showed himself alive
[1:29:44] after his passion by many infallible
[1:29:47] proofs having seen of them forty days
[1:29:50] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[1:29:51] the kingdom of God so after his passion
[1:29:55] he was sure yo yo he showed himself
[1:29:58] alive what was his passion his passion
[1:30:00] was redeeming you amen this is why I'm
[1:30:03] here upon the earth this is love has
[1:30:05] brought me here love for my last ones I
[1:30:09] need to redeem them back to myself
[1:30:10] hallelujah where his passion I mean he
[1:30:13] wasn't a robot Jesus wasn't a robot
[1:30:16] other scriptures be sad here now I'm sad
[1:30:19] they do this now there's no no he was
[1:30:21] human being God became a man to take on
[1:30:25] human battles to know what it was like
[1:30:27] to have mind battles to know what was
[1:30:30] like to be tempted he was tempted on all
[1:30:31] points yet without sin I mean so he
[1:30:34] knows what it's like to go through what
[1:30:36] we go through he knows what it's like to
[1:30:38] lose loss yeah I mean knows what it's
[1:30:39] like to lose loved ones he knows what
[1:30:42] it's like to be misunderstood he knows
[1:30:43] what it's like to be bullied he knows
[1:30:45] what it's like to be made fun of amen
[1:30:48] he understands what it's like because he
[1:30:50] went through it he experienced it amen
[1:30:52] but we are his passion hallelujah God
[1:30:57] you know love brought him here for you
[1:31:02] not just for even you know if it was
[1:31:05] just for wine it was for me you gotta
[1:31:07] think of it like that Jesus became man
[1:31:10] died on the Calvary as our sacrifice if
[1:31:13] it was just one he would have done it
[1:31:15] and if and when God prophesied behold I
[1:31:19] send you Elijah the Prophet before the
[1:31:20] grand jurors will
[1:31:21] the Lord Amen if it was just for one God
[1:31:24] would have had his messenger in his hand
[1:31:26] and he we've gone through exactly the
[1:31:27] same things just for one because that's
[1:31:30] how much value God puts on part of
[1:31:32] himself hallelujah and that's how much
[1:31:35] value God puts upon you Callooh
[1:31:38] he can't lose that's the battle he
[1:31:40] cannot lose he can't lose a part of
[1:31:41] himself that's impossible
[1:31:44] hallelujah so we have to have confidence
[1:31:48] and I trust we do amen he there is value
[1:31:53] in applying the blood amen
[1:31:56] people could have everything they wore
[1:31:58] in the world but do they have peace no
[1:32:01] they're still empty that's why you look
[1:32:04] at the great stars of the world many of
[1:32:07] them on drugs broken families broken
[1:32:10] relationships no peace suicide whatever
[1:32:13] it may be why cuz they're not happy they
[1:32:16] have all the money they can do whatever
[1:32:17] they want but what do they have they
[1:32:20] actually have nothing amen
[1:32:23] but those who know the Lord hallelujah
[1:32:26] you can have nothing in the bank account
[1:32:28] but you can have everything holy why cuz
[1:32:31] you've got peace you know where you're
[1:32:33] going you know your sins have been
[1:32:34] taking care of your guilt your shame
[1:32:35] your iniquities whatever it may be has
[1:32:37] been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:39] he said Lord I could die right now I
[1:32:41] know where I'm going I am not afraid to
[1:32:44] walk through the portals of death
[1:32:45] because you are with me hallelujah you
[1:32:48] will take me to the other side and money
[1:32:50] can't buy that money can buy it has to
[1:32:54] be given but also has to be received so
[1:32:57] it's up to you I would just receive it
[1:32:58] say yes Lord Here I am
[1:33:00] Amen and apply the blood hallelujah I
[1:33:03] mean that's why we got confidence this
[1:33:06] message works this blood it works
[1:33:12] amen it was good in the first church age
[1:33:15] it's the good at the end hallelujah
[1:33:17] this word works amen we have to have
[1:33:21] confidence amen and so that's why I keep
[1:33:24] saying oh yeah and I'll say it again you
[1:33:27] have to look at the value of applying
[1:33:28] the blood the death angel can't come
[1:33:30] into my house he can't strike my family
[1:33:33] he can't get a whole
[1:33:35] them cuz the blood is applied halleluja
[1:33:38] halleluja and the blood is got to be
[1:33:39] applied to every heart as you you do not
[1:33:42] get him by association you get him by
[1:33:44] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:33:46] hallelujah
[1:33:48] and that's why you know brother Graham
[1:33:49] says when the token is applied it makes
[1:33:51] you feel so relaxed now that relaxing
[1:33:56] doesn't mean well I'm just going to go
[1:33:57] live on a beach under a coconut tree for
[1:33:59] the rest of my life kind of attitude no
[1:34:01] it makes you so relaxed because you know
[1:34:03] your debts been paid I mean there's
[1:34:05] nothing held against you I mean you're
[1:34:07] protected I mean you have a shield
[1:34:09] hallelujah you're in the mighty fortress
[1:34:11] of our God nothing can harm you I mean
[1:34:15] anything that comes against you will be
[1:34:16] defeated hallelujah you will overcome
[1:34:18] all things why because you're under the
[1:34:21] blood you've applied the token the life
[1:34:22] of God is in you hallelujah
[1:34:25] makes you feel so relaxed why cuz the
[1:34:28] dev always comes along oh this could
[1:34:30] happen and this could happen and this
[1:34:31] could happen hold on no no the word says
[1:34:34] this will happen and this will happen
[1:34:36] and the sub conclusion is you're going
[1:34:38] to be on fire and I'm not going to be on
[1:34:40] fire you're going to burn I'm going to
[1:34:42] be dancing on streets of gold you
[1:34:43] weren't even being a memory anymore
[1:34:45] devil hallelujah you will not be
[1:34:48] remembered no more you're just going to
[1:34:50] be gone and I still will be hallelujah
[1:34:54] hallelujah amen
[1:34:58] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:35:02] amen proving his word he says see it's
[1:35:06] it's by the true believers that he
[1:35:08] proves his word not by those who say
[1:35:11] they believe but those who really
[1:35:12] believe it's by his believing children
[1:35:14] that he proves his word now he had the
[1:35:16] believers the old cropper died off the
[1:35:18] unbelievers that said we couldn't take
[1:35:20] it
[1:35:20] he let every one of them perishes
[1:35:22] speaking of his role in the wilderness
[1:35:23] every one of them but the believers who
[1:35:25] was left Moses had been taken to glory
[1:35:27] and the unbelievers had perished in the
[1:35:29] wilderness and this was their children
[1:35:32] there was only two that crossed over and
[1:35:34] that was believers Caleb and Joshua they
[1:35:36] was the believers they was the one who
[1:35:38] crossed over that's the only way God can
[1:35:41] do it as by his believing children you
[1:35:43] believe that all right his believers was
[1:35:45] the one that done it he used him to
[1:35:47] cross over with
[1:35:48] see now I want you to notice he does
[1:35:51] that in every age he does it in every
[1:35:53] age by the same method he has to take
[1:35:56] believers and then in order to make
[1:35:57] believers to meet that word
[1:35:59] he's got a pre-dinner to that age you
[1:36:01] see he's got to predestinate this thing
[1:36:04] to be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:36:07] age did you get that did you feel it did
[1:36:10] you see it did you understand it that's
[1:36:11] what's happening today he predestinated
[1:36:14] it to the spy his foreknowledge so he
[1:36:17] proves his word through his believers
[1:36:19] and never ever let the devil make you
[1:36:22] think you and make believer an
[1:36:23] unbeliever
[1:36:24] do not let him rob you of what you have
[1:36:27] say God say Satan get out of my way I'm
[1:36:30] a believer in God he has joined himself
[1:36:33] to me by his blood he's made me a
[1:36:35] believer it doesn't matter what I feel
[1:36:37] how I think I mean no faith does not
[1:36:39] change faith is not based on feelings
[1:36:41] it's not based on even what I think
[1:36:43] about it I mean it's what I believe you
[1:36:45] may not understand it I mean the
[1:36:47] Apostles couldn't understand it when
[1:36:49] Jesus said eat my flesh drink my blood
[1:36:50] if you do not you have no life you know
[1:36:52] you know you don't have eternal life
[1:36:54] they couldn't explain it Jesus didn't
[1:36:56] explain it but they believed the one
[1:36:58] that was speaking had the words of
[1:36:59] eternal life and they stayed with him
[1:37:01] and it paid off
[1:37:02] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:37:04] this message sure there's many things we
[1:37:06] may not understand you take even the Old
[1:37:09] Testament take the Book of Ezekiel do we
[1:37:11] understand it all
[1:37:12] no but do we believe it's the Word of
[1:37:15] God amen you take Jose you take any
[1:37:18] their prophecies do we understand it
[1:37:20] although if you understood it then you
[1:37:22] wouldn't need faith amen
[1:37:24] but walk by faith and not by sight we
[1:37:26] don't walk by mental understanding we'll
[1:37:28] walk by faith and the promise of God
[1:37:30] hallelujah and you know what opens thee
[1:37:34] you know what opens every door faith in
[1:37:37] the finished work of Calvary opens every
[1:37:39] door amen the same faith that you yes I
[1:37:44] promise is how do you apply the token to
[1:37:46] your family the same faith you believe
[1:37:48] for your own salvation use that same
[1:37:50] faith for your family it worked on you
[1:37:52] it'll work on them I mean it worked on
[1:37:55] you you got the Holy Ghost I mean you
[1:37:57] got change you got transform I haven't
[1:37:59] used that same faith on your children
[1:38:00] use that same faith on your family
[1:38:02] don't look at what they're doing it
[1:38:04] doesn't matter what they're doing I mean
[1:38:05] look at the promise Holly you look at
[1:38:07] the promise amen that's why you got to
[1:38:09] do I mean when the spies went into went
[1:38:11] into the Promised Land they're looking
[1:38:13] what the enemy was doing
[1:38:14] they have big cities they got big Giants
[1:38:16] they've got big armies how can we take
[1:38:17] it Caleb Caleb and Joshua they weren't
[1:38:20] looking what the enemy was doing they
[1:38:22] look at the promise of God we're more
[1:38:24] than able to take it because God's given
[1:38:25] it to us let's go take it
[1:38:27] hallelujah as the same thing with any
[1:38:30] promise of God don't look at the
[1:38:31] symptoms look at the promise I mean look
[1:38:34] at the promise of God and just hold that
[1:38:35] before yourself how they hold there
[1:38:38] before us have a walk into it I mean
[1:38:40] that's all you've got to do that's why
[1:38:43] Jesus said only believe all things are
[1:38:45] possible so if you only believe that's
[1:38:48] the only thing in the equation is your
[1:38:49] faith in the word it's not only
[1:38:51] believing how you feeling are you having
[1:38:54] a good day you having a good week you
[1:38:56] having a good month how much is in your
[1:38:58] bank account how bad is the sickness
[1:39:00] what's going on here you know
[1:39:02] no only belief only believe don't look
[1:39:04] at those things only belief all things
[1:39:07] are possible to them that belief and
[1:39:08] that's all we have to do only believe
[1:39:12] but that's the problem with this age we
[1:39:14] have too many choices others brother
[1:39:16] Aaron McGarry preached years ago youth
[1:39:18] can be said you know you know you know
[1:39:20] you go by something just I want to buy
[1:39:22] some jeans once upon a time it's your
[1:39:25] size now it's skinny boot cut straight
[1:39:30] whatever rips not ripped you know
[1:39:33] staying not staying what color you know
[1:39:35] there's all these choices it's not only
[1:39:37] buying jeans anymore there's too many
[1:39:38] choices and that's everything in life
[1:39:40] now what color shirt you want what kind
[1:39:43] of fabric you know cuts whatever
[1:39:45] whatever yo there's all these choices
[1:39:47] that's not helping me to be mean to only
[1:39:50] believe that means we only take the
[1:39:53] consideration of the word into account
[1:39:55] that's all we need to do hallelujah we
[1:39:59] call I'm just going to finish we're
[1:40:01] called overcome in this age we're here
[1:40:03] to overcome that's why this message has
[1:40:06] overcoming power in it as why it came to
[1:40:08] you and because God doesn't want it on
[1:40:10] books and tapes he wanted living though
[1:40:12] word has to be has to put on flesh
[1:40:15] hallelujah and you look at you look at
[1:40:17] the believers in Hebrews 11 I mean they
[1:40:20] died in faith they were in faith they
[1:40:22] will believe us that matter what outcome
[1:40:24] happened they were believers hallelujah
[1:40:27] Amen so we shouldn't just just only
[1:40:30] believe how do you know the death angel
[1:40:32] can't get you your own faith how do you
[1:40:35] know it doesn't get you you you're still
[1:40:37] believing I mean when Jesus said howbeit
[1:40:40] when the Son of Man come you know
[1:40:41] returns will he find faith upon the
[1:40:43] earth he's not meaning just a belief
[1:40:46] he's talking about a a faith in the
[1:40:49] whole body of Revelation of the word of
[1:40:52] God so he says will he find faith upon
[1:40:55] the earth and and your answer says yes
[1:40:56] Here I am however you've caused me to
[1:41:00] believe you will find faith when these
[1:41:02] parties have changed you will find a
[1:41:03] people that can be transformed amen
[1:41:06] I mean let's have some musicians please
[1:41:08] my friends don't don't shrink back don't
[1:41:12] be discouraged press the battle
[1:41:15] hallelujah

[1:41:27] you ought to apply the blood the word
[1:41:29] has to put on flesh you got to put it
