[27:42] I receive the Lord together
[27:49] praise God so it's great to be here
[27:52] tonight amen it's great to have our
[27:54] brother Michael Cervin Jack from
[27:55] Melbourne here we met him uh 13 years
[27:58] ago I think it was down in Christchurch
[27:59] and haven't been in touch at all but
[28:01] it's been great to spend a few days
[28:02] together and have some real good
[28:04] fellowship and I believe running for a
[28:05] real treat tonight remember God knows
[28:08] everything about our lives sometimes we
[28:09] think does God know us does he care does
[28:11] he understand what we're going through
[28:12] he knows everything and I believe he can
[28:15] take a brother from Melbourne who
[28:16] doesn't know anything about us and he
[28:18] can speak directly to our lives from the
[28:20] end from the start to the end of the
[28:21] service and meet every need I believe he
[28:23] can do that amen because the word is
[28:25] still a discerner the thoughts and tense
[28:26] of the hearts it means let's just say
[28:28] Lord amen we serve the same Lord Jesus
[28:31] the Same Lord Jesus in Melbourne the
[28:33] same Lord Jesus here in Stokes Valley
[28:34] and you know it's this wonderful bride
[28:36] of Christ around the world so let's just
[28:38] let's just enter in tonight and say Lord
[28:41] you can do the supernatural incredible
[28:43] film we can imagine tonight amen so amen
[28:46] let's just sing that um magnify the Lord
[28:48] with me just the courses brother Michael
[28:49] come but yeah God bless you amen magnify
[28:53] [Music]
[29:08] [Applause]
[29:12] [Music]
[29:25] praise the Lord
[29:28] God bless you
[29:30] it's good to be here
[29:32] after a long long time
[29:35] some 40 years since I walked down the
[29:37] streets of Wellington it doesn't make
[29:40] thank you sisters we'll just finish with
[29:41] the music for now that doesn't make me
[29:43] old it just means I started when I was
[29:45] very young
[29:48] it's uh good good group of musicians and
[29:51] of course Wednesday night
[29:53] those that love the Lord usually come on
[29:56] Wednesday night
[29:57] amen those who love the church come on
[29:59] Sunday morning
[30:01] so we want to be where he's amen he's
[30:05] worthy to be praised I hope you'll uh
[30:07] get to pick up my English accent
[30:10] uh sorry Australian accent we all speak
[30:12] English
[30:13] but uh I won't hold you too long
[30:18] but I do want the Lord to move tonight
[30:20] amen
[30:22] amen and you know ministers come and
[30:24] they usually say well if the Lord
[30:25] touches one heart we'll be blessed
[30:28] well I'm a little bit more greedy than
[30:30] that
[30:31] I'm not so humbled to say Lord touch my
[30:34] brother there and all the other 99 go
[30:36] home and get nothing
[30:38] I believe the Lord has something for
[30:40] each one of us tonight
[30:42] amen as I said it's certainly glad I'm
[30:45] glad to be here with brother Ben who um
[30:49] just about the whole world knows for his
[30:52] youth came
[30:53] so praise the Lord for that that's good
[30:55] you're doing such a good thing and just
[30:58] continue because it's a blessing to the
[31:00] people of God Amen
[31:02] and also I hear that you have Fellowship
[31:05] on Wednesday before the service then on
[31:07] Sunday these are some original things
[31:09] that you do do which perhaps are
[31:12] different than some other people do just
[31:14] continue
[31:15] anything you can do any excuse you can
[31:18] do to have Fellowship that's just
[31:20] wonderful amen and
[31:22] um especially Wednesday night children
[31:24] need to go to school the next day and so
[31:26] forth and
[31:27] you know it's the middle of the week
[31:29] it's what we call the hump of the week
[31:30] but uh
[31:33] as good time as any nice and warm cold
[31:36] windy outside we're here praising the
[31:39] Lord why not it's a good place to be in
[31:41] amen whenever we come to God's house
[31:44] friends there is always something good
[31:47] that can happen and thus happen
[31:49] amen and if you draw on the word not so
[31:52] much on me as I said tonight I'll just
[31:54] maybe share a little bit I didn't want
[31:56] to get into a perhaps the subject and
[31:58] really preach but uh just to get to know
[32:01] you because I believe we have two common
[32:04] things
[32:05] we have the same enemy
[32:07] who respects no borders
[32:10] no visas he doesn't need a visa to come
[32:12] to New Zealand or back to Australia or
[32:15] to South Africa but we have the same
[32:18] Lord and that's the one I'm more
[32:22] we have the same Lord as in our brother
[32:25] said we have a same message that binds
[32:28] us together
[32:29] we have never seen most of you yes some
[32:32] of you I have seen in the last few days
[32:34] some of you I have known uh Sister
[32:38] Christine there from
[32:40] her father and her mother
[32:42] that the main thing is that the Lord is
[32:45] the one who makes a difference friends
[32:46] it's to know him is life eternal see
[32:50] some friends and so forth so I just
[32:52] believe we've come to a good place
[32:54] you know it's very hard when you come
[32:56] for the first time just to get right
[32:58] into it and start preaching and expect
[33:00] everybody just to respond you know in a
[33:02] phenomenal way but uh oh I like this
[33:05] violin
[33:08] no it's not a violin I thought why they
[33:11] reduce the
[33:14] well your island is a little bit smaller
[33:16] than Australia isn't it
[33:18] but uh we've come here with one purpose
[33:21] I believe
[33:22] you know and if we've come with the
[33:24] right attitude yeah he will never
[33:27] disappoint us amen amen it will never
[33:29] let us down
[33:31] you know when that woman came in the
[33:33] Press of hundreds of people thousands of
[33:35] people Milling around the Lord I still
[33:38] didn't even get to the introduction but
[33:39] I'll get there
[33:41] she only had one thing in her mind
[33:44] she had a need actually
[33:46] one who hide it she spent all the money
[33:49] on the Physicians and they couldn't help
[33:51] her but she said if I can but only Touch
[33:55] the Hem of His Garment
[33:57] and friends you know what
[34:00] I believe that there'll a lot went
[34:03] behind the scene the disciples didn't
[34:05] see the others didn't recognize what was
[34:07] happening but I believe our Lord sent a
[34:09] couple of angels down Gabriel and
[34:11] Michael maybe and so listen just make a
[34:14] bit of room so she can get there
[34:17] and friends she got there
[34:22] and she got her made met
[34:24] he's the same today I believe whatever
[34:26] you need is regardless of the words that
[34:28] I may speak if he's the same which he is
[34:32] then he can meet all of our needs here
[34:35] all of us I see some young teenagers
[34:38] there coming to church on Wednesday
[34:40] that's very good
[34:42] see some younger ones
[34:44] you know school children that's very
[34:46] good I see some older ones I see some
[34:49] that are a little bit tired from work
[34:51] today that have come to God's house
[34:52] that's also good amen amen we've come to
[34:54] the right place friends he will never
[34:57] disappoint us
[34:59] he is a good God we sing about it we
[35:01] praise him and so forth but he's a good
[35:04] god well I think brother Ben for
[35:05] allowing me to come as I said he knows
[35:08] some of my children and many of our
[35:11] young people we always try to encourage
[35:13] to encourage to come to your October
[35:15] Camp as I said which has become an
[35:18] international thing and they always get
[35:21] a blessing they say they've just got a
[35:23] nice group of people there but friends
[35:26] it's the law that makes a difference
[35:27] whether it's at the camp whether it's on
[35:29] Wednesday night amen so may the Lord
[35:32] just speak to us I have a little uh
[35:34] Rosebud for our brother
[35:36] you know a lot of people brother Branham
[35:39] told us to give person a rosebud while
[35:41] they're still alive than to get a great
[35:43] big wreath on their funeral casket and
[35:46] put it on the coffin and say this is
[35:48] from family such and such too late let's
[35:51] rather be kind to one another while we
[35:53] still together amen and I just thought
[35:57] I'll give a little uh poem now of course
[35:59] this
[36:01] well I'll read it and then you decide
[36:03] whether it applies to you or not all
[36:04] right but this is what it says never
[36:07] satisfied
[36:08] if the pastor is Young which is they say
[36:12] that he lacks experience
[36:14] if his hair is gray
[36:16] then he's too old for the Youth
[36:19] if he has four children then he has far
[36:23] too many
[36:25] yeah if he does not have any then he's a
[36:28] bad example
[36:30] if he preaches from notes
[36:33] his sermons are dry and very
[36:35] conservative
[36:37] if his messages are not prepared then
[36:41] his topic is insufficiently profound
[36:45] if he cares for the poor in the church
[36:47] it's only a pretense
[36:49] if he turns his attention to the wealthy
[36:52] then he is appeasing to them
[36:55] if he uses too many illustrations he
[36:59] disregards the Bible
[37:01] but if he does not illustrate then he's
[37:04] preaching is not sufficiently coherent
[37:08] if he condemns the evil he has no
[37:11] confidence
[37:13] if he does not cry against sin then he's
[37:16] trying to compromise not an easy job
[37:19] if he preaches the truth he's overly
[37:23] contentious
[37:24] if he does not declare God's complete
[37:27] counsel
[37:28] then he's a hypocrite
[37:31] if he's unsuccessful in pleasing
[37:34] everybody he is offending the church and
[37:37] should retreat
[37:39] if he makes them all satisfied then
[37:42] there is no compunction
[37:44] if he drives an old car
[37:47] it is a reproach for the assembly
[37:49] if he purchases a new one then he's
[37:52] prone to secular values
[37:55] yeah if he alone preaches all the time
[37:59] people get bored listening to the same
[38:01] preacher
[38:03] if he invites preachers as guests then
[38:06] he's neglecting his pastoral Duty
[38:10] if he's well paid he's inclined just for
[38:14] the income
[38:15] if he's paid if his pay is low then they
[38:19] say that it's a proof that he isn't
[38:22] worth much anyway
[38:24] therefore my friends
[38:27] and my brother if you think that he is
[38:31] justly Accused come and walk in his
[38:34] shoes
[38:35] and try to please people who are never
[38:38] satisfied I wish you a lot of success
[38:40] and hope you have found yourself in my
[38:43] story
[38:44] why I read that frenzy is that you need
[38:46] to appreciate your pastor you need to
[38:49] support him you need to pray for him
[38:51] secretly and privately it's not an easy
[38:54] job I tell you what I would rather be
[38:58] the president of the United States than
[39:00] sometimes be a pastor of a church
[39:02] yeah but it's the it's God who gives the
[39:06] Ministries it's God who gives the gift
[39:09] gifts to the people and if it's used
[39:12] according to his word then the pastor
[39:15] can bless you it can be a blessing to
[39:18] all of you individually and collectively
[39:20] of course and then the work of the Lord
[39:23] can progress amen
[39:25] so careful never speak against the
[39:28] pastor brother Branham told us
[39:30] amen so I just want to um mention maybe
[39:36] one more thing for young people listen I
[39:38] always appreciate young people in a
[39:40] church
[39:41] because they are the office bearers of
[39:45] tomorrow if there is a tomorrow
[39:47] that was spoken to me 40 years ago
[39:50] brother Michael you are young you know
[39:52] just serve the Lord with all your heart
[39:54] because if there is a tomorrow you need
[39:56] to perhaps have an office and and do
[39:58] some of the duties that you can do for
[40:01] the Lord
[40:01] well friends I didn't think that 40
[40:05] years later I would come back to New
[40:07] Zealand and see many of you that I have
[40:09] never seen before but what I'm saying is
[40:12] a generationist past
[40:14] in that generation
[40:16] if I quickly do a cross-section many of
[40:19] you perhaps weren't even born in in 1983
[40:22] well many of you were but some of you
[40:23] weren't but you know what we had four
[40:26] giants that I met that year in Gisborne
[40:30] brother Perry green
[40:32] is gone
[40:34] brother Roger maybe they're just names
[40:36] to you he's gone
[40:38] brother Harold hildebrain from Canada
[40:40] Edmonton
[40:42] he's passed on
[40:43] brother Reginald Searle many of you know
[40:46] by name or have met him or so forth he's
[40:49] gone on Friends
[40:50] four Giants have moved on of this
[40:52] message
[40:53] but there's got to be others to take
[40:56] that place
[40:57] and I thank God that brother Benny's one
[40:59] of those
[41:00] a young giant but becoming one amen we
[41:04] heard some of his preaching and so forth
[41:06] and it's just a blessing so anyway let's
[41:09] just read this for the young people
[41:11] because we need our young people
[41:14] it says a quote to remember you've heard
[41:16] it before it's look friends let me just
[41:19] get this out of the way there is really
[41:21] nothing new that I could deliver to you
[41:23] and if I did I'm sure brother Ben would
[41:25] have something to say
[41:27] so I'm not here to bring you something
[41:29] new I'm just here to remind you I'm here
[41:32] to encourage you as a visiting minister
[41:34] to to tell you that you can move on you
[41:38] can have the victory you can be
[41:40] victorious in the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:42] today
[41:44] just as the world seems to be going down
[41:47] the gurgler
[41:48] France we're living in a world that has
[41:50] never seen some of the things that we
[41:53] are seeing with our own eyes
[41:55] I myself in my short generation as a
[41:57] Believer 40 odd years I've seen so many
[42:01] changes
[42:02] and I say to myself and my children I
[42:04] wonder what's the next thing that
[42:06] Hollywood is going to come up with is
[42:08] there anything else that they can
[42:09] develop
[42:10] you know there is
[42:12] hell is being expressed on this Earth
[42:16] devil is slowly trying to see how far he
[42:19] can push his people he's subjects but
[42:21] thank God that we can see the light
[42:23] frames thank God that we're not part of
[42:25] that group that is just following like
[42:28] blind sheep but God has given us the
[42:31] light amen and with that light we can
[42:34] overcome but it's it's serious the the
[42:37] the
[42:38] world has become insane
[42:42] insane
[42:44] brother Brandon preached the letting of
[42:45] the pressure and he said you know it's
[42:47] the world will become insane well back
[42:50] in the 60s there was still some sort of
[42:52] sanity
[42:54] but I tell you what today our dare say
[42:56] it would be pretty hard to find a bit of
[42:58] Sanity out on the streets and amongst
[43:00] the people
[43:01] that's how far it's gone friends
[43:04] cannot go any further well possibly a
[43:06] little bit more until the Lord calls her
[43:08] to a halt
[43:10] yeah amen when he calls to a hold they
[43:12] say listen let's have peace in this
[43:14] world let's have United Nations let's
[43:16] really get something going friends they
[43:19] there can be no peace on this Earth
[43:21] until the Prince of Peace comes and we
[43:25] join him as his bride in the Millennium
[43:28] amen
[43:29] amen so
[43:31] keep looking up don't allow the things
[43:34] of the world to encapture you and
[43:36] enshrine you there is a better way and I
[43:39] want to encourage our young people and
[43:42] then we'll get to the word it says a
[43:44] quote to remember
[43:45] sin will take you further than you want
[43:49] to go
[43:50] slowly but surely taking control
[43:54] sin will give you short-term pleasure
[43:57] but long-term pain
[44:00] sin will keep you longer than you want
[44:03] to stay
[44:04] and sin will cost you far more than you
[44:08] ever want to pay
[44:09] that's not just for young people that's
[44:11] for all of us amen so may the Lord truly
[44:14] help us not to be bound by any things of
[44:17] this world Amen
[44:18] amen but just line it up with the word
[44:21] see where it fits and say Lord with your
[44:25] grace I am bound more than ever before
[44:28] to make it through
[44:29] I'm not stopping here this how this
[44:32] Earth is not my home this world is not
[44:34] my home I'm just a passing through amen
[44:37] my treasures are light up somewhere
[44:39] beyond the blue I believe that's our
[44:42] expectation that's what we're looking
[44:44] forward amen so friends
[44:47] um
[44:48] young people always look after young
[44:51] people
[44:52] any church that loses the young people
[44:54] it's not a healthy Church
[44:58] yes my wife and I just recently sat down
[45:01] and I said darling let's just see how
[45:04] many of our young people are not coming
[45:06] to our church we haven't got a big
[45:07] church but over the years we've had
[45:09] people come and go like you have had
[45:12] and to our surprise we came up with
[45:16] about 70 people young people that are
[45:19] still around in the world somewhere but
[45:21] are not coming and serving the lord
[45:23] and I said that's quite a shock
[45:26] over these years they could be there a
[45:28] part of the assembly uh serving the lord
[45:30] loving the Lord being an example and so
[45:33] forth but the devil has managed to
[45:35] deceive them friends and we live we live
[45:38] in an age of deception as we're going to
[45:41] see later on brother Brown preached a
[45:43] sermon to deceived Church there's
[45:46] nothing more powerful today than the
[45:49] deception that the enemy is using on his
[45:52] subject
[45:53] and you know when you get these scams I
[45:55] think you have them here in New Zealand
[45:57] like we have them back home what is that
[45:58] that's a deception yeah in the natural
[46:01] that is a Deception comes on your phone
[46:03] comes on your computer comes in your
[46:05] emails or whatever it is a form of
[46:08] deception friends the devil is just
[46:10] trying to use every means to deceive his
[46:13] people but thank God that God's people
[46:16] will not be deceived amen amen praise
[46:19] the lord well you know as I said as a
[46:22] visiting preacher I thought he was
[46:23] appropriate just to uh uh encourage you
[46:27] because we all need encouragement once
[46:29] in a while is that right none of us are
[46:32] so immune from the things of this world
[46:34] that we can say brother Michael I'm
[46:36] walking this road with my Lord I'm so
[46:38] close with him that nothing of this
[46:40] world
[46:41] troubles me
[46:42] sooner or later we all get uh uh pested
[46:47] or trouble a little bit by the things of
[46:49] the world
[46:50] and if we're not careful they can
[46:52] actually become part of us
[46:54] this is what we're going to talk about
[46:55] tonight is there a spot in your heart
[47:00] it's pot in your heart I'll you'll
[47:02] understand by the time I get to the end
[47:04] all right but friends that encouragement
[47:06] we need once in a while I'll just give
[47:08] you one example just to free you up a
[47:10] little bit to show you that I'm not a a
[47:12] starchy Presbyterian preacher
[47:16] um I think it's a true story but you
[47:18] know how the preachers are they hear one
[47:19] story they get it from someone else and
[47:21] they borrow they add a little bit and
[47:23] brother Ben hears it then later on he
[47:25] forgets a little bit he adds a bit of
[47:26] his own it's still a true story friends
[47:28] no no we're all subject to a brother
[47:31] I'll tell you what if my wife was here
[47:32] she said Michael you've taken three
[47:34] stories and put them into one
[47:37] she said you added a little bit you have
[47:39] exaggerated darling but it's not
[47:40] intentional yeah you know we are humans
[47:44] and a different atmosphere we react
[47:46] differently
[47:47] anyway
[47:50] the pastor's wife so very good I tell
[47:53] you they have a special Ministry it's
[47:56] not one of the gifts in Corinthians 14
[47:58] but it's somewhere there keep an eye on
[48:01] him
[48:02] so what happened is this young this
[48:06] person uh he he lived in a certain place
[48:10] and his work was on the other I'll
[48:12] assume this is the no that's not that's
[48:14] a bad example the cemetery was here and
[48:16] his house was here and his job was here
[48:18] and every day when he finished work he
[48:21] would just pack up and just come through
[48:24] the cemetery and come home as quickly as
[48:27] he could to see his wife and his
[48:28] children and once he was working a
[48:31] little bit late at his job I call it
[48:35] over time without pay
[48:36] so he worked a bit longer he was getting
[48:38] a bit dark and he said to himself I
[48:40] really want to get home quickly he won't
[48:42] go his usual way which he knew you know
[48:45] pretty much off by heart he said he'll
[48:47] take a shortcut
[48:48] and as he's taking Ashoka watch those
[48:51] shortcuts friends yeah I'm glad there's
[48:53] no Shortcuts To Heaven amen there's only
[48:56] one way and Jesus is that way anyway so
[48:59] he said I'll just take a shortcut so as
[49:02] he takes the shortcut he goes through a
[49:04] different part of the cemetery and as
[49:06] he's walking he falls into an open grave
[49:11] just Falls in it didn't hurt himself
[49:14] sort of gets up and he says to himself
[49:16] oh I'm just get up and go home so he
[49:19] tries to get up and every because it was
[49:21] a fresh grave every child every time he
[49:24] grabbed the edge of the Grave the soil
[49:26] crumbled in
[49:27] so he tried a few times he'd tried a few
[49:30] times he screamed of course to the
[49:32] gravedigger but he was gone so there was
[49:34] no one around so he tried a few times
[49:37] and every time he did the soil crumbled
[49:38] in
[49:39] he said well I have another option
[49:41] except to realize that I've got to stay
[49:44] here all night sit on this coffin that
[49:47] was under him sit in the corner and in
[49:50] the morning the gravedigger will come
[49:51] and he'll get out
[49:52] so he
[49:54] he was happy with that that was his only
[49:56] option then as he was sitting there in
[50:00] the corner
[50:01] he comes another man
[50:04] but this man was a bit more chirpy
[50:06] brother he was a little bit more filled
[50:08] with something some sort of liquid that
[50:12] makes you a little bit sort of happy and
[50:13] chirpy and you know not water of course
[50:17] so he was singing to himself you know
[50:20] coming along and here he comes and he
[50:24] comes over the grave and he falls in
[50:27] this other man
[50:29] and this man is in the corner and he
[50:31] sees there's a man here on on the other
[50:33] corner here fell down on the coffin
[50:36] so this drunk he was drunken he was
[50:39] drunk so he starts I'll tell you what I
[50:42] think he's sobered up very quickly but
[50:44] uh he he says oh oh he says how I'm
[50:46] going to get out of this so he tries to
[50:48] jump up any same problem the soil
[50:51] crumbles and he can't do it some of you
[50:53] already know what's going to happen look
[50:54] at that
[50:55] and uh he tries a few times he tries he
[50:59] tries and he can't
[51:01] just had enough
[51:04] I just can't get out he says to himself
[51:07] and as he's just about had enough
[51:10] he hears a voice
[51:12] from the other side of the grave
[51:15] he said friend
[51:17] don't try there's no use trying
[51:20] I couldn't get out and neither can you
[51:22] you know what friends he sobered up he
[51:26] jumped up he jumped over the grave got
[51:30] outside and I'll tell you what he was
[51:32] sober going home after that
[51:34] so what I'm saying is we need sometimes
[51:36] a bit of a nudge a bit of a push even in
[51:40] in this story we can learn something you
[51:43] know the the power that it didn't have
[51:45] somehow you found it within himself and
[51:47] she jumped over the grave and I'll tell
[51:49] you what he was running home he thought
[51:52] that the deceased person was talking so
[51:58] so may the Lord help us to uh just get a
[52:01] little bit you know from him today and
[52:03] say Lord thank you for speaking to me
[52:05] amen
[52:06] well you receive that one nicely I'll
[52:08] just give you one more
[52:10] and then we'll certainly get into it
[52:11] look I do believe that this is not a
[52:13] place for joking but sometimes an
[52:16] example does more than perhaps many
[52:19] words that I could say all right and uh
[52:22] may it just help you and you know
[52:25] like brother Branham in his sermons when
[52:27] he goes to a new place he usually gives
[52:28] one or two stories or examples you know
[52:32] let's sort of people calm down a little
[52:34] bit accept him and so forth and then he
[52:37] preaches the word amen there was another
[52:40] example where you know sometimes these
[52:42] pushers are good
[52:44] there was a rancher in America who was
[52:46] very very rich
[52:48] and he had a pool party a barbecue we'll
[52:51] call it all right around the pool
[52:53] and he put a reward and he said
[52:56] he had a swimming pool in his backyard
[52:59] and he filled it with crocodiles
[53:02] alligators piranhas and all you know
[53:04] those fish that are not very nice to us
[53:08] and so it was the whole swimming pool
[53:11] was full of these fish
[53:13] and um the reward was he was very rich
[53:17] and he said look whoever can swim
[53:19] through that pool without getting bitten
[53:23] or eaten by The Animals uh we'll either
[53:27] get a million dollars a thousand acres
[53:30] of land or they can have his daughter in
[53:33] marriage
[53:34] so people were Milling about you know
[53:37] looking at it it's not worth the risk
[53:40] you know what's the point of trying to
[53:42] go there and be bitten or eaten or
[53:45] maimed for the rest of my life for the
[53:47] sake of a million dollars most of us
[53:49] also would say no thank you but as
[53:52] people were Milling about on the edge of
[53:54] the pool we there was a sudden splash
[53:57] splashing the water
[53:59] and everybody's turned around and they
[54:01] followed what happened there they saw
[54:03] this man
[54:05] in the Water swimming for all with all
[54:08] his might for for his life and he was
[54:11] swimming and you know dodging the
[54:13] animals and and
[54:15] sweating is not the word when you're in
[54:17] water I suppose it's all wet but it's a
[54:20] matter of life or death so he was
[54:22] swimming swimming zigzagging and he
[54:24] finally made it to the other side of the
[54:26] pool
[54:26] and the owner came the Rancher came and
[54:29] he said young man
[54:33] can't believe it that you made it I
[54:36] didn't think anyone could swim through
[54:37] all these animals here but since you did
[54:40] which of the three rewards they want to
[54:43] take
[54:45] he wipes his bra from the water
[54:48] and he says sir
[54:50] I'm not after a reward I just want to
[54:53] know the name of the person who pushed
[54:54] me in
[54:58] yeah
[54:59] friends
[55:02] it might be in your life that you feel
[55:05] like you've got crocodiles and
[55:06] alligators and everything around you but
[55:08] friends God will see us through
[55:11] amen amen let's stand to our feet as we
[55:14] just open to a couple of verses
[55:17] and try to
[55:19] get you out before nine I heard there
[55:21] was a clock here but I can't see it oh
[55:23] it's coming up tomorrow
[55:25] wow I'm a day early all right well I
[55:27] better preach till tomorrow brother
[55:29] all right let's open to Second Peter
[55:34] second Peter just as I said I thought I
[55:36] had other
[55:38] um
[55:39] thoughts on my mind but you know how it
[55:41] is you just want to share something that
[55:43] you believe the Lord's placed on your
[55:45] heart that can be a blessing for the
[55:48] local Fellowship in
[55:50] here in New Zealand amen so second Peter
[55:54] 3
[55:56] let's just read a couple of verses there
[55:58] we're talking about our subject today is
[56:00] is there a spot in your heart
[56:03] now I haven't come to criticize I
[56:05] haven't come to correct you but I have
[56:08] come simply to preach the word and
[56:10] because we have come to the house of
[56:12] correction then it's God who needs to
[56:15] speak to us amen amen so let's have a
[56:17] look at second Peter three
[56:19] verse 11.
[56:21] seeing then that all these things shall
[56:24] be dissolved things that are around us
[56:26] what mineral persons ought you to be in
[56:30] all your holy conversation and godliness
[56:34] that word conversation life it means
[56:37] your life everyday life looking for and
[56:39] Hasting unto the coming of the the day
[56:42] of the Lord God wherein the heavens
[56:44] being on fire shall be dissolved and the
[56:47] elements shall melt with fervent Heat
[56:50] one press and the bomb might do that but
[56:53] it's not time yet friends because we are
[56:54] here amen wherefore beloved seeing that
[56:58] you look for look for such things be
[57:00] diligent that you may be found of him in
[57:04] peace with air spots and blameless
[57:08] amen let's just turn to our author Lord
[57:11] Jesus we thank you for these words Lord
[57:13] I pray for the inspiration thereof Lord
[57:16] may you speak to every heart from the
[57:18] youngest to the oldest Lord we all need
[57:20] a touch from you Lord none of us can
[57:22] walk out he's saying that we just don't
[57:24] need another touch but Lord I believe
[57:26] you have a touch for your people here
[57:28] tonight I believe you can speak to us in
[57:30] such a way that we can have the victory
[57:32] law that we can you can deal with our
[57:35] hearts Lord and cleanse us from every
[57:36] spot that we truly would be holy in all
[57:40] of our conversation and in all of and in
[57:43] all our lives thank you for this
[57:45] opportunity bless the local assembly I
[57:47] pray in Jesus name amen you may be
[57:50] seated and God bless you
[57:53] well friends
[57:55] needless to say
[57:57] we are living as I said in the beginning
[57:59] in a very very
[58:02] upside down world
[58:05] it's a world that we don't want to live
[58:07] in it's a world that's certainly my
[58:09] parents and my grandparents would have
[58:12] never wanted to live in they lived in a
[58:14] lot more different world than what it is
[58:16] in 2023
[58:18] and uh as I said this is this Insanity
[58:22] everywhere and the only problem is there
[58:25] is more of those that are insane than of
[58:28] us who are sane now I'm not putting
[58:31] people down I'm just being honest you
[58:33] just need to walk down the street and
[58:34] and and and just uh uh push in in front
[58:38] of a car my they take out a knock an ax
[58:41] or a baseball bat and you're in trouble
[58:43] if that's not insanity
[58:45] Prince you road rage is just such an
[58:48] awful
[58:49] it's almost the pandemic in this age
[58:52] you hear of I don't know if it's in your
[58:54] country like ours but people were killed
[58:56] for the sake of just pushing in or or
[58:58] not giving a blinker indicator and they
[59:00] moved in front and it's happened
[59:02] it's happening all the time in America
[59:04] especially you know what's feeding it
[59:06] Hollywood movies but anyway that's by
[59:08] the way anyway so friends it's not the
[59:12] world we want to live in amen
[59:14] there is another Spirit that's coming
[59:16] and I'm talking about not just people's
[59:18] ideas but I'm talking about spirits that
[59:22] are actually ruling and controlling
[59:24] people
[59:25] there's another Spirit that's come very
[59:26] strongly in Australia and as I said I
[59:28] believe it's here too because it
[59:30] respects no borders is this and it's a
[59:34] very nice term but a very nasty term
[59:37] what's behind it is what we call
[59:39] political political correctness
[59:42] if it's not politically correct you know
[59:45] this and all you can be in trouble they
[59:46] can you can they can throw you in prison
[59:49] they can you know do all sorts of things
[59:51] to you you've got to you know political
[59:54] correctness has gone to its limits
[59:58] you all you know you've got to ask a
[1:00:00] person sorry are you a he or a she or
[1:00:02] how should I address you address you
[1:00:04] friends that is insanity
[1:00:07] but that's what our children our young
[1:00:10] boys and girls that are going to school
[1:00:12] are exposed with and grappling with they
[1:00:16] may not know what it is but you and I
[1:00:17] know we know that there's those uh
[1:00:20] Devils that were tied up in the river
[1:00:22] Euphrates that have been released in
[1:00:24] this end time to bombard God's people
[1:00:29] and come against God's people and also
[1:00:32] look the devil is not smart at all
[1:00:35] he's got his people and he makes it so
[1:00:38] hard he's a very awful taskmasket to be
[1:00:40] under his control
[1:00:42] so he's got all these people in his uh
[1:00:44] torturing with all these spirits that
[1:00:47] are released and you know they call it
[1:00:49] politically correct and so forth France
[1:00:52] are the only book that I know that is
[1:00:54] politically correct is the Bible hey
[1:00:56] amen
[1:00:57] and as we're going on as we're going on
[1:01:00] they are trying to take this away from
[1:01:03] us
[1:01:04] they're doing a Bible now
[1:01:06] so if you know this or not or what
[1:01:09] religion you are but Pope has commanded
[1:01:13] or ordered that they should do a Bible
[1:01:16] that is neutral that is uh neutral in
[1:01:20] terms of God that anything that is
[1:01:22] repeated in the Bible you know more than
[1:01:24] once it should be done away with so
[1:01:26] they're going to take the 66 books that
[1:01:29] we beloved a love and believe there are
[1:01:31] sent from God for us and turning into a
[1:01:34] small little handbook and called I'm not
[1:01:37] even going to call it the Bible it's
[1:01:39] just a book but friends they're working
[1:01:41] on it seriously very soon it'll be out
[1:01:43] there'll be no God in in masculine
[1:01:47] gender he and the Bible says he is our
[1:01:51] God I'm sorry you know God created it
[1:01:55] that way God created he and she amen but
[1:01:59] today they're just trying to
[1:02:01] they don't know what they're trying to
[1:02:02] do
[1:02:03] but there's one thing they're trying to
[1:02:05] do
[1:02:05] if they can get this book out of our
[1:02:07] hands for instance especially the King
[1:02:09] James version because all the other
[1:02:12] versions have been tampered with you
[1:02:14] take a seed and you cut it and you put
[1:02:15] it in the ground it won't grow
[1:02:18] I got a pamphlet some time ago to send
[1:02:21] to my house and it says kurong Bookshop
[1:02:24] I think you might have it here too so I
[1:02:26] said oh let me see if I maybe I need to
[1:02:28] buy a new Bible
[1:02:29] listen to me
[1:02:31] 39 versions of the Bible
[1:02:34] not one was King James
[1:02:37] you think the devil is not attacking
[1:02:39] this book
[1:02:40] sure is
[1:02:42] all the other versions are
[1:02:45] wrong I'm not saying you can read it and
[1:02:47] refer to it but I'm saying that while
[1:02:50] this book was used as amongst the
[1:02:53] English-speaking people as the Bible
[1:02:55] there were revivals
[1:02:58] 65-66 there were revivals the moment
[1:03:01] they introduced The New American version
[1:03:03] and the new standard version and the New
[1:03:05] Jerusalem version and all and many many
[1:03:07] other versions friends they you know
[1:03:10] what the devil wants he wants to attack
[1:03:12] that word
[1:03:13] sure we haven't got persecution
[1:03:15] worldwide as yet but if he can take this
[1:03:18] word out of the hands of the people
[1:03:21] friends we are powers we need every word
[1:03:24] that's here
[1:03:25] I'm not so fanatical if you want to read
[1:03:27] a new King James version but that's got
[1:03:29] 200 mistakes others have hundreds and
[1:03:32] thousands and you know what are some of
[1:03:34] the main things that he has done he's
[1:03:36] taken away the blood of Jesus
[1:03:39] he's taken away the name of Jesus that's
[1:03:41] right acts 8 I can show to you it's all
[1:03:43] there I've got a painful that exactly
[1:03:45] Compares all the inter uh translations
[1:03:48] with this King James now I didn't come
[1:03:50] here to sell your King James Bible but I
[1:03:52] came to tell you to show you how that
[1:03:54] the world we live in if they can attack
[1:03:57] this word friends if they can downplay
[1:04:00] its Authority if they can change the
[1:04:04] name of God and call it a neutral name
[1:04:07] or something which is coming out so you
[1:04:09] for young people don't you touch that
[1:04:11] Bible when you go to the Bookshop don't
[1:04:12] even look at it it's not for you it'll
[1:04:14] come out soon and it'll be called the
[1:04:17] new Bible
[1:04:19] that'll be the acceptable standard
[1:04:21] friends thank God that we know what we
[1:04:24] are holding in our hands but I'm just
[1:04:26] showing you that that the devil is so
[1:04:28] fly you see many of you don't know but
[1:04:30] all the other interpretations of the
[1:04:32] Bible have Jesuit priests behind it and
[1:04:36] and and and changing it progressively
[1:04:39] the devil doesn't come and say oh get
[1:04:41] rid of this Bible and we'll give you uh
[1:04:43] some new version
[1:04:44] he progressively changes the words
[1:04:47] friends he progressively dilutes it he
[1:04:51] progressively takes the name of Jesus he
[1:04:53] progressively takes the blood of Jesus
[1:04:55] and many other things I mean if I
[1:04:57] started telling you here we would be
[1:05:00] here till tomorrow and you'll be
[1:05:01] surprised and you'll say listen I don't
[1:05:03] want any of those
[1:05:04] yeah it's all right children it's
[1:05:05] probably about
[1:05:06] 30 40 words that you need to learn from
[1:05:08] Old English and you've got it
[1:05:10] it's not so hard
[1:05:11] right I'm sure it's not so hard
[1:05:13] my but I'm giving you an example that we
[1:05:16] are living in a world that the devil is
[1:05:18] acting and uh so you know such a Sly
[1:05:23] manner yeah and unless we are
[1:05:26] spiritually alert unless our eyes are
[1:05:29] spiritually open friends we will fall in
[1:05:31] for it amen and that's why I believe God
[1:05:34] has sent the message in the same time
[1:05:36] to alert us to keep us away to tell us
[1:05:40] that the devil is a soil Fox amen and we
[1:05:45] need to keep away so this political
[1:05:47] correctness has gone mad
[1:05:49] I think your ex-prime minister was asked
[1:05:52] can you define a woman
[1:05:54] and one of ours was actually or this
[1:05:56] current one I think he couldn't do it
[1:06:00] ridiculous brother
[1:06:02] absolutely ridiculous it's it's it's
[1:06:04] it's putrid
[1:06:06] and you get your children and my
[1:06:08] children and my grandchildren I will be
[1:06:10] exposed to that that's why they need the
[1:06:12] cover of the word and that's why they
[1:06:14] need to come to church that's why they
[1:06:16] need a Godly home listen the raising of
[1:06:19] children starts in your home not in
[1:06:21] school friends you teach him reading and
[1:06:24] arithmetic at home before they go to
[1:06:27] school yeah
[1:06:28] you prepare them as my granddaughter
[1:06:31] came the other day to her grandmother
[1:06:32] and asked a certain question and she
[1:06:34] explained it a proper way friends you
[1:06:37] give the right education to your
[1:06:39] children at home then you're going to
[1:06:41] prove bulletproof them so they won't be
[1:06:44] affected by the spirits that are in
[1:06:46] school
[1:06:47] not just amongst their peers their
[1:06:50] students but the teachers
[1:06:53] teachers don't know what they believe
[1:06:55] they don't know what they can say they
[1:06:57] don't know what's right they're all just
[1:07:00] everybody's just well well it's just the
[1:07:02] way it is well we've got to accept it no
[1:07:04] you don't have to accept it no friends
[1:07:06] we don't have to accept it young boys
[1:07:09] and girls you don't have to accept them
[1:07:11] when someone at school tells you
[1:07:12] something is different than what you
[1:07:14] learned at Sunday school so listen I'm
[1:07:16] not sure about that but I'm going home
[1:07:17] and I'll ask my mother and my father
[1:07:19] that's the attitude you should have
[1:07:21] children and I will help you listen if
[1:07:24] anyone is going to tell you the truth
[1:07:26] it'll be your mum and your dad
[1:07:29] not your teacher as good as she might be
[1:07:31] or he might be not your friend at school
[1:07:34] but it's your mother and your father
[1:07:36] in fact you'll hear some good things in
[1:07:38] church too especially in this church
[1:07:40] where the word is preached amen
[1:07:42] that's the protection we need to put
[1:07:45] around our children friends
[1:07:46] what is the point if we gain the whole
[1:07:49] world and lose our children to the world
[1:07:52] to this evil satanic World in which we
[1:07:57] live so political correctness Now it
[1:07:59] only happened yesterday again I'm not
[1:08:01] here to preach uh news of the world but
[1:08:04] we the scripture says that we need to
[1:08:06] have our eyes open yeah we need to look
[1:08:09] at the current events that are happening
[1:08:11] and place it in the word
[1:08:13] place it in the message and say this is
[1:08:16] really happening many things that
[1:08:18] brother Branham prophesied back in the
[1:08:20] 50s and the 60s we thought perhaps would
[1:08:22] never happen they're happening they're
[1:08:25] being fulfilled yeah yeah they just
[1:08:26] found that off the shore of California
[1:08:30] the two plates
[1:08:32] that have this certain
[1:08:34] oil or liquid whatever it is that's
[1:08:37] between them that keeps the place from
[1:08:39] rubbing each other and then exploding or
[1:08:41] lifting up it's they just found out that
[1:08:44] there was a a lot of a lot of steam and
[1:08:47] a lot of something coming out from the
[1:08:50] ocean floor
[1:08:52] off the coast of California
[1:08:55] off not far from Los Angeles
[1:08:58] how far maybe I don't know if you maybe
[1:09:02] 50 or 100 kilometers it doesn't matter
[1:09:04] it's not far but friends it's she's
[1:09:06] honeycombed underneath it's preparing
[1:09:09] for a big one and people are just
[1:09:11] sitting you know by and saying oh well
[1:09:14] what will happen will happen but let's
[1:09:16] be ready let's be prepared let's not be
[1:09:19] called unawares amen let's not be off
[1:09:22] guard
[1:09:23] because as I said even through the the
[1:09:25] way they are introducing to us the new
[1:09:27] Bibles and everything else it is all a
[1:09:30] ploy of the enemy to dilute the word of
[1:09:33] God
[1:09:34] and friends what I was trying to say in
[1:09:36] the
[1:09:36] 1960s and so forth the moment they
[1:09:39] started playing around with this word
[1:09:40] and bringing in all those other uh new
[1:09:43] standard American translation and new uh
[1:09:46] version and so forth you know what
[1:09:48] happened follow it
[1:09:50] Revival stopped brother Ben do some work
[1:09:54] on them
[1:09:55] tell me
[1:09:56] where is our TL Osmond and Oral Roberts
[1:09:59] it's gone
[1:10:00] their sons come and they just have a few
[1:10:03] hundred people and that's about it
[1:10:05] there's something about it because you
[1:10:07] see when you take away the word of God
[1:10:09] from the people God cannot work the way
[1:10:12] he wants to work let me tell you another
[1:10:14] one this is not in my notes but it's in
[1:10:16] the Bible
[1:10:17] the boy let's turn to it because I think
[1:10:19] this is one that New Zealand uh is
[1:10:21] attacked by this and so is of course in
[1:10:24] Australia and all over the world
[1:10:25] actually you know where it comes from it
[1:10:27] comes from Hollywood again
[1:10:29] comes from Hollywood listen to this
[1:10:30] let's turn to Sam
[1:10:32] 139 well at least you'll remember this
[1:10:34] amen amen
[1:10:40] Sam and your children too you need to
[1:10:42] have it
[1:10:43] written down somewhere
[1:10:49] Psalm 139 verse 20. listen to what it
[1:10:52] says
[1:10:53] for they speak against the wickedly
[1:10:57] people
[1:10:58] and thine or your enemies take your name
[1:11:04] in vain
[1:11:06] what do you have
[1:11:08] little girls in every girly film
[1:11:11] oh my God
[1:11:13] they use that name so freely and so
[1:11:17] often anybody that's talking on the
[1:11:20] phone and something's gone wrong OMG I
[1:11:22] want to mention it because it's not for
[1:11:23] us to mention friends but that is using
[1:11:26] the lord's name in vain here it says
[1:11:28] that the enemies take your name in vain
[1:11:30] that has become the catch word or if any
[1:11:33] phone conversation anybody's saving
[1:11:36] they're constantly using it you know
[1:11:38] who's using it Indians Muslims
[1:11:41] Christians everybody yeah
[1:11:45] and the scripture says Ten Commandments
[1:11:47] there shall not use the name of the Lord
[1:11:48] thy God in vain so that has become the
[1:11:51] catch word in in Hollywood and the devil
[1:11:54] sort of slip that in through some of the
[1:11:55] movies there and and so forth and it's
[1:11:58] become acceptable who speaks against the
[1:12:00] brother Well everybody's using it I've
[1:12:03] even caught some Believers starting to
[1:12:04] use it watch it that is that you should
[1:12:07] not use that not in that way when we
[1:12:09] worship God and we praise him and we
[1:12:12] talk about him sure lift up the name of
[1:12:14] Jehovah amen but do not use it in a vain
[1:12:18] profane manner
[1:12:20] watch it you've got to work tomorrow
[1:12:22] wherever and you'll see how it's used
[1:12:24] everywhere hey you know it's just bad
[1:12:27] it's really bad that's all I can say so
[1:12:30] all those things are happening in
[1:12:32] America just yesterday
[1:12:35] Target one of the department stores
[1:12:38] has lost
[1:12:39] 10
[1:12:40] billion dollars
[1:12:43] because they did not want to promote
[1:12:46] some of the girls clothing that has come
[1:12:50] in in 10 days they have lost 10 billion
[1:12:53] dollars
[1:12:54] because they made a stand but friends no
[1:12:56] one last they'll have to bow into it and
[1:12:59] accept it they didn't want to Market
[1:13:01] this certain clothing I don't want to
[1:13:02] mention it it you know they just felt it
[1:13:05] wasn't for them to Market it and they
[1:13:07] just pulled away from it
[1:13:09] and they lost 10 billion dollars in 10
[1:13:11] days
[1:13:12] you talk about financial pressure you
[1:13:15] talk about uh you know
[1:13:17] Target if you don't want to go our way
[1:13:20] and you don't want to promote this
[1:13:22] clothing that we have here
[1:13:24] yeah you're 10 billion dollars poorer
[1:13:27] and then they just won't even go
[1:13:28] bankrupt but good on them took a stain
[1:13:31] amen and I think every believer should
[1:13:33] friends let's make a stand it's all
[1:13:35] right if it costs us a little bit the
[1:13:37] Lord will make it up amen amen and I
[1:13:40] said I don't want to talk much about it
[1:13:42] but so forth so this world system is not
[1:13:44] only corrupt
[1:13:46] rather Brandon said uh flashing red
[1:13:49] lights of his coming
[1:13:51] friends those flashing red lights from
[1:13:53] 1960 to 2023 are a lot stronger a lot
[1:13:58] more persistent a lot more reoccurring
[1:14:01] these volcanoes these these earthquakes
[1:14:03] these uh tornadoes in America and in
[1:14:07] other parts of the world which they
[1:14:08] never had
[1:14:09] but it's all happening because the
[1:14:10] scripture says so that in the end times
[1:14:13] they'll be shaking
[1:14:15] and the Bible says and everything that
[1:14:18] can be shaken shall be shaken friends
[1:14:21] but praise God that if we have the word
[1:14:24] of God in us
[1:14:25] we will not be shaken amen we can watch
[1:14:29] what's happening and we say well that's
[1:14:31] just the Fulfillment of scripture amen
[1:14:33] amen I stand on the scripture I'm not
[1:14:35] going to be shaken by these things
[1:14:36] friends but everything the scripture
[1:14:38] says that can be shaken shall be shaken
[1:14:41] yes
[1:14:42] it's happening thank you thank you it's
[1:14:44] happening but thank God for our little
[1:14:46] bride right here in this little house
[1:14:48] this room here that gathers on
[1:14:50] Wednesdays and Sundays that is not
[1:14:53] shaken by the things that are happening
[1:14:56] in the world Amen in fact it's just
[1:14:58] fulfilling scripture so all we do is say
[1:15:01] Lord that's fulfilling your word look
[1:15:04] friends don't get me wrong we are not
[1:15:07] rejoicing when people die yeah I don't
[1:15:09] like a single person to die amen I don't
[1:15:12] honestly I have a natural feeling
[1:15:14] towards people but I don't want to see
[1:15:16] anyone even hurt
[1:15:17] if I see blood I run away from it I
[1:15:19] can't take it just as well I'm not a
[1:15:21] nurse or a doctor you see but I can't
[1:15:24] but the reality is it's happening
[1:15:27] thousands by thousands of dying and so
[1:15:31] forth and it's all fulfilling the
[1:15:33] scripture
[1:15:34] how glad and thankful we need to be for
[1:15:36] the for God's word amen
[1:15:39] amen Now quickly
[1:15:41] because we're living in this age
[1:15:43] the type that we have in the Old
[1:15:45] Testament in Exodus 12 you all know it
[1:15:47] so I won't just refer to it I won't read
[1:15:49] it it says that at the time of the
[1:15:52] Passover at the time of their
[1:15:54] Deliverance which is our going home amen
[1:15:57] which is our Rapture that's the only
[1:15:59] thing brother random say that we're
[1:16:00] waiting for now is the rapture of the
[1:16:03] church 60 years ago brother but it's
[1:16:06] still as fresh today we still believe it
[1:16:08] and if there's another tomorrow and
[1:16:10] there's another 10 15 years brother Ben
[1:16:12] keep on preaching it because the Lord is
[1:16:14] still coming
[1:16:15] oh I gotta go you know what I said my
[1:16:19] brother-in-law just came back from
[1:16:20] Belgium
[1:16:22] and I said brother how are things there
[1:16:24] he said not very good I said why what's
[1:16:27] happening he said they have come up with
[1:16:29] new laws that there's only two churches
[1:16:33] a state
[1:16:35] church and if you're not a state Church
[1:16:38] you'll be persecuted and if you are in
[1:16:40] the state church just do churches
[1:16:42] Universal Church they call it maybe
[1:16:45] that's another name for Catholic church
[1:16:46] but anyway that's what they call it and
[1:16:48] you know what if you're a minister of
[1:16:50] that church you have to sign certain
[1:16:52] papers that you will only preach what
[1:16:57] they tell you to preach
[1:16:58] and if a single one of your members uh
[1:17:02] reports you and says listen we don't
[1:17:04] like what Michael is speaking and
[1:17:06] talking they can just do away with you
[1:17:07] in no time now listen to this brother
[1:17:10] they have to sign a notice of memorandum
[1:17:15] which just means a sheet of paper with
[1:17:17] some things on it to say that the
[1:17:21] Rapture of the church will not take
[1:17:24] place
[1:17:25] absolutely the very yes very last my
[1:17:29] brother-in-lawing I wish I had it here
[1:17:31] he said they have to sign that's agreed
[1:17:34] as in the country of Belgium that the
[1:17:37] Rapture of the church is no longer
[1:17:40] applicable and it's not going to happen
[1:17:42] the next event to happen is the great
[1:17:45] white Throne judgment
[1:17:46] friends
[1:17:48] that's happening right today these days
[1:17:51] they're just signing them
[1:17:53] absolutely but you see what the
[1:17:56] Believers rejoicing and are waiting for
[1:17:58] they're taking it away you know what
[1:18:01] they're taking it away because they
[1:18:02] thought it could happen before it hasn't
[1:18:04] happened so they're logical human mind
[1:18:06] tells them well there's no such thing
[1:18:08] but they're not allowed to preach that
[1:18:10] the moment they do their license is
[1:18:12] they're disqualified and and so forth
[1:18:15] that's happening
[1:18:17] and as I said it's not called the
[1:18:18] Catholic church it's called The
[1:18:20] Universal Church in Belgium
[1:18:23] anyway I got sidetracked but some
[1:18:25] information for you all right but these
[1:18:27] are the spirits these are just not good
[1:18:29] ideas that are happening or bad ideas in
[1:18:31] fact but these are spirits that were
[1:18:34] Unleashed that are really really working
[1:18:37] on the world today on the population of
[1:18:40] the world today but we thank God there
[1:18:42] is a little bride that is hid amen under
[1:18:46] those shadow of his wings and although
[1:18:48] they do all their friends that only
[1:18:50] makes us love this word more and more
[1:18:52] amen when he said that I said brother
[1:18:54] but that's the very thing we've been
[1:18:56] living for that's the very thing we're
[1:18:58] expecting yes the Rapture might not
[1:19:00] happen tomorrow but I'm living as if it
[1:19:01] will and if it doesn't happen tomorrow
[1:19:03] brother I'll come back in 10 years and
[1:19:05] I'll tell you the Rapture is still a
[1:19:07] scriptural teaching amen
[1:19:11] so God sent the prophet to tell us that
[1:19:13] there is no Rapture come on
[1:19:15] come on
[1:19:16] but that's the blindness that's in the
[1:19:18] world today
[1:19:20] yeah this is this is what's happening
[1:19:21] all around
[1:19:23] so with all these things happening what
[1:19:26] should we do
[1:19:27] pray for our children
[1:19:29] friends the greatest wealth you and I
[1:19:33] have I have four children by God's grace
[1:19:35] and two grandchildren and a third one on
[1:19:38] the way the greatest thing we have is
[1:19:41] our Offspring yeah
[1:19:43] does that matter cars don't matter jobs
[1:19:46] don't matter Prestige doesn't matter
[1:19:48] nothing matters but it's our children
[1:19:51] I believe it's coming home to us to say
[1:19:54] yes we need to protect them we need to
[1:19:56] cover them by the plan we need to cover
[1:19:58] them with our parental praise amen don't
[1:20:01] try to save all of Wellington get your
[1:20:03] children in first then once you get them
[1:20:05] in then yeah perhaps venture out a bit
[1:20:07] further and not being so facetious now
[1:20:09] to you but I'm actually telling you the
[1:20:11] truth
[1:20:13] the truth in the sermon Souls that are
[1:20:16] imprisoned now in case you haven't read
[1:20:17] it for a long time brother Brandon
[1:20:19] preaches and really says that things are
[1:20:21] really happening the way the Lord showed
[1:20:23] me in a vision and right towards the end
[1:20:25] and I can read it to you now he said
[1:20:27] Lord
[1:20:28] please I have Joseph Rebecca and Sarah
[1:20:32] that need to come in
[1:20:34] Lord is there still time for them to
[1:20:36] come in he goes a little bit further and
[1:20:39] he prays for his children again weeping
[1:20:41] if I read it to you it's just words but
[1:20:43] if you hear it on tape you can actually
[1:20:45] see the emotion he goes a little bit
[1:20:47] further I have it right here and he said
[1:20:49] Lord
[1:20:50] please I hope the time is not over yet I
[1:20:53] hope that my children can make it yeah
[1:20:55] friends that's the heart of a prophet
[1:20:58] that's the heart of a preacher who knew
[1:21:00] he's God and the value of his family
[1:21:02] amen that's the priority for me and my
[1:21:06] house We Shall Serve the Lord amen so
[1:21:10] pray for your children to be protected
[1:21:11] so in quickly as we go in Exodus
[1:21:15] at the Passover
[1:21:17] these just two things I want you to
[1:21:19] notice before they did leave Egypt
[1:21:24] there was a couple interesting things
[1:21:25] that I had to do
[1:21:28] you may not like this but it's true
[1:21:30] they ate the Passover which was a lamb
[1:21:33] and unleavened bread
[1:21:35] with bitter herbs brother
[1:21:38] it's right here Exodus 12. I have it all
[1:21:40] here you know I'm preaching the word
[1:21:42] anyway I'm just adding in it it's in
[1:21:44] there it says eat it with bitter herbs
[1:21:48] so when you have a roast on Sunday and
[1:21:50] your mother makes a nice roast and so
[1:21:51] forth melts through the house let
[1:21:54] someone put some bitter herbs there
[1:21:57] you say oh brother Michael that's not
[1:21:59] the best meal I've got to go back to my
[1:22:00] macca's
[1:22:01] friends but it's a type
[1:22:04] that we have to take the whole word of
[1:22:07] God and every trial that comes our way
[1:22:09] even if it's bitter in your life take it
[1:22:13] ask from the Lord and that will give you
[1:22:15] strength to go 40 years through the
[1:22:18] Wilderness and have the victory in the
[1:22:20] End Amen
[1:22:22] and you know what they also hated being
[1:22:26] dressed yeah
[1:22:28] what does it say and the bride has made
[1:22:31] herself ready let's put that garment on
[1:22:33] friends again it's another subject then
[1:22:36] not only that but they ate it with their
[1:22:39] shoes on their feet
[1:22:41] no Barefoot ones going across the Red
[1:22:43] Sea there brother
[1:22:45] whose shoes
[1:22:47] what are shoes the preparation of the
[1:22:49] Gospel of good of Peace amen
[1:22:52] the gospel they were ready and then they
[1:22:55] had a stick brother
[1:22:57] I had a staff that I had next to them
[1:22:59] picks it as 12 uh
[1:23:03] it's 11 yeah it's all there so in other
[1:23:05] words they were in a state of
[1:23:07] preparedness yes
[1:23:09] because they didn't know when the death
[1:23:12] angel was going to come
[1:23:14] but when he did come
[1:23:17] the Passover was ready which is our Lord
[1:23:19] Jesus Christ amen and they were ready
[1:23:22] they were dressed prepared they had a
[1:23:24] stick they had the shoes on and they
[1:23:27] were just listening
[1:23:28] perhaps for the cries all around them
[1:23:31] the angel came and struck the firstborn
[1:23:35] but those oh oh brother Michael you're
[1:23:38] only giving us half of the truth I sure
[1:23:40] am here's the other half there was
[1:23:41] another thing they had to
[1:23:44] put the blood
[1:23:46] on the doorpost on the left-hand side
[1:23:49] and the right hand side that's the door
[1:23:50] post of a door and the lintel is the top
[1:23:52] part of the door
[1:23:55] France the token had to be applied
[1:23:58] and you know if the token was applied
[1:24:00] they were ready the moment the death
[1:24:03] angel came they just got up and off they
[1:24:06] went
[1:24:07] how do you gather without a microphone
[1:24:10] without a computer without an internet
[1:24:12] without a mobile phone to send a text
[1:24:15] Brother Moses two and a half million
[1:24:18] people
[1:24:19] two and a half they say two to two and a
[1:24:22] half brother Brandon refers to one and
[1:24:23] the other and if you look at it it's 650
[1:24:25] 000 men plus women plus children so
[1:24:27] we're talking about two two and a half
[1:24:29] million people no text brother right no
[1:24:32] uh multiple broadcasting just one button
[1:24:35] and it goes to everybody yeah but you
[1:24:36] know what they had brother
[1:24:38] they had the word of the Lord amen and
[1:24:40] they had one voice that spoke with
[1:24:43] authority told them what to do and if
[1:24:46] all the two and a half million people
[1:24:48] listened which they did when the time
[1:24:50] came when the death angel came through
[1:24:51] the land they were ready and off they
[1:24:54] went
[1:24:54] no need for these modern things brother
[1:24:58] they were ready because they listened to
[1:25:00] the voice
[1:25:01] amen amen
[1:25:02] and um off they went the blood was
[1:25:06] sprinkled sorry the blood was applied on
[1:25:08] the doorpost and the lintel but not on
[1:25:10] the floor
[1:25:12] we don't walk over the blood of Jesus
[1:25:13] Christ
[1:25:14] and having it there and there it forms a
[1:25:16] cross
[1:25:18] that's the token we need to have amen
[1:25:20] even today
[1:25:21] amen surprise the Lord so and off they
[1:25:24] went and uh I won't spend much time
[1:25:27] there but
[1:25:28] another thing that's very important
[1:25:29] let's turn to it Psalm 133 is a local
[1:25:32] church I just want to encourage you not
[1:25:34] knowing perhaps when we'll be back again
[1:25:36] but just to help you stay together
[1:25:40] friends I Fellowship a little local
[1:25:43] church that stays together and is in
[1:25:47] unity in in one spirit and in one mind
[1:25:49] and in one Accord God can do something
[1:25:53] amen God can begin to heal the sick
[1:25:55] amongst them
[1:25:57] God can begin to bring the prodigals
[1:25:59] back brother
[1:26:00] the children that are in the world we're
[1:26:02] praying we're weeping he's saying Lord
[1:26:04] bring him back bring him back you be
[1:26:06] United as a body one by one there'll be
[1:26:09] a knock on the door and say listen I'm
[1:26:11] coming home I'm coming home I'm sick of
[1:26:14] this world I'm coming home too long I've
[1:26:17] walked and wondered in the world now I'm
[1:26:18] coming home amen friends and this is the
[1:26:21] unity that we're talking about listen to
[1:26:22] this even if I don't get to the other
[1:26:23] notes who cares Psalm 133 behold means
[1:26:28] look and watch
[1:26:29] how good and how pleasant it is for
[1:26:32] Brethren that means Brethren means
[1:26:34] brothers and sisters to dwell together
[1:26:37] in unity
[1:26:38] so it says first of all it's beautiful
[1:26:40] for husband another husband wife two
[1:26:43] years but a church to be in unity just
[1:26:45] like husband and wife yes
[1:26:47] watch this
[1:26:48] it is like the precious ointment upon
[1:26:51] the head that ran down upon the beard
[1:26:54] right down the beard even Aaron's bead
[1:26:58] that went down to the skirts of His
[1:27:01] Garment
[1:27:02] friends it was something special about
[1:27:04] this oil it came from the head it came
[1:27:07] on the face on the bead on his garments
[1:27:10] and down to his feet yeah
[1:27:12] yeah a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:13] protecting us hey man hey amen praise
[1:27:16] the Lord amen that's not all as the Jew
[1:27:20] the Jew of Herman and as the Jew that
[1:27:23] descended upon the mountains of Zion for
[1:27:27] there the Lord commanded the blessing
[1:27:29] even life forevermore you want to have
[1:27:32] life have Unity you want to have
[1:27:34] blessing have unity and when you have
[1:27:37] Unity you know what the Bible says here
[1:27:38] when you have Unity you don't have to
[1:27:40] say Lord give us blessing give us
[1:27:42] blessing blesses the Bible says that God
[1:27:43] automatically sends the blessing yeah so
[1:27:46] if you are united as a body of Christ
[1:27:48] Acts 2 and they were in one mind and in
[1:27:51] one Accord and the Holy Spirit came and
[1:27:53] did the rest if you are united my
[1:27:56] friends the holy spirit will work as he
[1:27:59] Wills yes
[1:28:01] amen
[1:28:02] you don't have to cry and say brother
[1:28:04] give me blessing uh the blessing will
[1:28:07] come from God it says there the Lord
[1:28:09] commands His blessings you know what the
[1:28:11] word command means God sees a group of
[1:28:13] people that are united here he says
[1:28:16] Holy Spirit Angels whatever pour out the
[1:28:19] blessing He commands and it says the
[1:28:21] blessings got to come to this little
[1:28:23] church in Stokes Valley because they are
[1:28:26] united you don't have to pray for it
[1:28:28] and not only is it a blessing but you
[1:28:31] know whether he gives life
[1:28:33] yeah don't we all need a bit of Life a
[1:28:35] bit of life from the Lord amen so be
[1:28:38] United and you'll see how the Lord will
[1:28:42] move amongst you as he has
[1:28:45] listen to this just two quotes here
[1:28:47] brother Brown says knowing that what we
[1:28:50] say we mustn't just say because we are
[1:28:53] gathered together to just haphazardly
[1:28:55] speak on anything
[1:28:56] I'm not speaking too about anything
[1:28:57] listen to this but it's something that
[1:29:01] will help
[1:29:02] stabilize
[1:29:03] stabilize the people friends
[1:29:06] for we are going to pass through
[1:29:08] dangerous treacherous Waters we already
[1:29:12] sailing through them oh yeah and
[1:29:15] sometimes I guess it's with you as it is
[1:29:16] with me there seems to be so much of it
[1:29:19] it's so scary
[1:29:20] so we need to preach about things that
[1:29:23] will stabilize the people friends your
[1:29:25] pastor cannot live your Christian life
[1:29:27] for you he can pray for you he can help
[1:29:30] you but you need to go home and live
[1:29:32] your Christian Life hey then you need to
[1:29:34] be a witness for the Lord your pastor
[1:29:36] cannot be at your place or work and and
[1:29:39] witness and and testify and baptize
[1:29:42] people there it's your job brother it's
[1:29:44] your job sister we all have a duty see
[1:29:47] God has strategically placed Us in
[1:29:49] different places for that very purpose
[1:29:52] you know for what purpose that the last
[1:29:54] seed of God predestinated seed of God
[1:29:57] may come in and when it it when they do
[1:30:00] come in
[1:30:02] Gentiles mercies over and God moves over
[1:30:05] to Israel so that scripture brother
[1:30:07] absolutely and there's one other
[1:30:09] condition before it happens it says that
[1:30:11] the cup of the Emirates or the enemy
[1:30:14] will be filled up so the cup of this
[1:30:16] evil the things that I was talking to at
[1:30:18] the beginning will be just so full
[1:30:22] and then the Lord's coming back for us
[1:30:25] you say brother Michael you're speaking
[1:30:26] and preaching as if he's coming back
[1:30:28] tonight well why not amen
[1:30:30] amen if I didn't I wouldn't be saying
[1:30:31] these things friends
[1:30:32] I believe he can come back tonight
[1:30:34] oh brother Michael Andrew
[1:30:37] deceived a little bit you know too
[1:30:40] excited about it no
[1:30:42] if I know the Lord's coming back
[1:30:44] tomorrow I'm going to go up on the roof
[1:30:46] and put my roof up on the house
[1:30:49] and you who are in living and you've got
[1:30:51] a lot of gardening places there go and
[1:30:53] plant your potatoes
[1:30:55] is that right yeah sure
[1:30:58] that's the right attitude to have
[1:31:01] but anyway we got from the blessings
[1:31:03] there that the Lord commanded his
[1:31:04] Blessing
[1:31:06] don't have to pray for our friends He
[1:31:08] commands it he makes sure that it comes
[1:31:11] on the people here in quotes uh sorry
[1:31:14] this is my little book it's see what
[1:31:16] I've decided and what I heard
[1:31:18] over the years we as message people
[1:31:22] we hear so much
[1:31:24] we hear the tapes we hear the sermons
[1:31:26] together as a fellowship or whatever and
[1:31:29] we hear it and we hear it and we hear it
[1:31:31] and we hear it and we forget
[1:31:34] and I said Lord this is just not right
[1:31:37] I've been listening for many years and I
[1:31:39] forg I forget some of the basic things
[1:31:41] I'm only limited to how much I can
[1:31:43] retain things
[1:31:45] so I got myself a little book called The
[1:31:47] assimilation book
[1:31:49] so in other words I hear it I write it
[1:31:52] down just in my handwriting different
[1:31:54] quotes but they are there and I look
[1:31:56] through them every so often I know what
[1:31:58] sermon they come from and so forth and
[1:32:00] it has helped me because friends many
[1:32:03] things that we do here in church brother
[1:32:05] Ben preaching and other ministers
[1:32:07] preaching here that we hear on tape
[1:32:09] we forget let's be honest many of you
[1:32:12] will walk out of this door tonight and
[1:32:14] you'll forget what brother Michael was
[1:32:15] saying except you'll remember those two
[1:32:16] funny examples is that right
[1:32:18] I hope it's more than that I hope I
[1:32:21] didn't come all the way from Australia
[1:32:22] just to tell you that
[1:32:24] here and that's
[1:32:27] what we come to church for okay why do
[1:32:30] we come to church for is to find out
[1:32:33] where Our Faults Are
[1:32:37] you don't believe in church attendance I
[1:32:40] think you've got three beautiful faults
[1:32:41] you better come to to church you'll find
[1:32:43] out where your faults are I'm not scared
[1:32:45] Lord let brother Ben preach you like to
[1:32:48] clean preach and these are things in my
[1:32:50] life which will be referring to a
[1:32:51] spotting on My Heart Lord I want that
[1:32:53] removed I don't understand before the
[1:32:56] Lord and the Lord says Michael why don't
[1:32:57] you deal with this this and this but now
[1:32:59] is the time to deal with the friends we
[1:33:01] come to the house of correction for God
[1:33:04] to speak to us
[1:33:05] hey man and listen to me and when he
[1:33:08] does speak to you to us do something
[1:33:10] yeah yeah what I've spoken thus far
[1:33:12] maybe I've spoken to this brother in a
[1:33:14] certain thing this sister in another way
[1:33:15] this is in another way and on and on but
[1:33:17] friends we all have something
[1:33:20] that we need the law to deal with us it
[1:33:22] says we come to church to find out where
[1:33:24] our faults are and the things that we
[1:33:27] might better ourselves by if we come to
[1:33:30] church for any other reason objective
[1:33:32] rather then this I'm afraid we won't get
[1:33:36] too much out of it
[1:33:38] you come out of routine you come out of
[1:33:40] habit you come because your mum and dad
[1:33:42] tells you've got to come you're coming
[1:33:44] because it's a Sunday morning and you're
[1:33:45] honoring the resurrection good but not
[1:33:48] why you should come to church see that's
[1:33:50] why I'm calling it a book of a
[1:33:51] simulation I have it here and I'm
[1:33:53] looking at it and say Lord am I coming
[1:33:54] to church with the right motive are
[1:33:56] going to church we must come to find our
[1:33:59] weaknesses find our bad places see how
[1:34:02] little we are and put our trust in
[1:34:05] somebody that's strong perfect strength
[1:34:08] by Perfect weakness amen well since you
[1:34:12] like that one you'll like the next one
[1:34:13] from perfect strength and today we know
[1:34:16] that we need a Revival we know we need a
[1:34:20] stirring amongst the people so don't
[1:34:22] tell me it's over don't tell me there's
[1:34:25] no point preaching in Wellington and
[1:34:26] telling others France God still has
[1:34:29] these little Remnant that needs to come
[1:34:31] in
[1:34:32] if it's no one else it's my two sons
[1:34:34] that are in the world are the two are
[1:34:36] praising the Lord and saving the Lord
[1:34:37] but I've got two that are not and if we
[1:34:39] pray for them every day so much so that
[1:34:42] we talk about it that the one boy that I
[1:34:43] haven't seen for eight years because he
[1:34:45] walked out on us I just by talking we
[1:34:47] have dreams I have dreams and I dream
[1:34:49] that I'm talking to him that he's coming
[1:34:51] home and so forth I'm actually expecting
[1:34:53] it amen I'm actually speaking it into
[1:34:55] existence why not use the spoken word
[1:34:57] for that too brother hey man don't you
[1:35:00] use it to to say something negative
[1:35:02] about your brother use it for the
[1:35:04] Salvation of your family
[1:35:06] amen
[1:35:07] come on that's right and when the bride
[1:35:09] becomes mature enough that spoken word
[1:35:12] will come into operation
[1:35:14] won't that be wonderful brother
[1:35:16] yeah amen
[1:35:18] we need a friends we need it but that's
[1:35:20] the unity and that's why we come to
[1:35:22] church okay we're just going to leave it
[1:35:24] there I'll just touch on a couple more
[1:35:25] things and I can't see a clock but I
[1:35:27] assume you're still all looking at me
[1:35:29] none of you are tired none of you are
[1:35:31] sleeping that's a sign for me to go on
[1:35:33] is that right brother amen Amen brother
[1:35:34] Phil had a hard day perhaps today with
[1:35:36] his uh Refrigeration mechanic work and
[1:35:40] so forth and he still come here to to
[1:35:42] Worship the Lord that's great amen now
[1:35:44] our spiritual life our personal walk
[1:35:46] with the Lord is very very crucial
[1:35:48] friends you can come to church be the
[1:35:51] best one in the church you can sing you
[1:35:53] can praise the Lord you can lift up your
[1:35:55] hands oh my that person is really really
[1:35:59] good
[1:36:00] friends
[1:36:01] hair is your personal walk with the Lord
[1:36:04] because that's what matters
[1:36:06] you see there's an example that they
[1:36:08] gave us once they said that there was a
[1:36:11] house fire
[1:36:12] and in that house fire there was some
[1:36:14] certain Plastics and other materials
[1:36:17] and the thing was so pungent I think you
[1:36:19] know what the word pungent is it's an
[1:36:21] English word it's an Australian word it
[1:36:23] was so thinking young children that when
[1:36:26] they walked into the house everything
[1:36:29] stunk on this particular plastic
[1:36:32] I don't know if any of you know but when
[1:36:34] you burn some plastic oh it can stink
[1:36:36] for days
[1:36:37] I've tried to do some cooking brother
[1:36:39] and I put things in the pot and I forget
[1:36:41] about it I come back the whole house
[1:36:42] thinks my wife is in the car she's
[1:36:44] walking through the front door she said
[1:36:45] Michael have you been trying to cook and
[1:36:47] you made a mess
[1:36:48] I said yeah I suppose so how do you know
[1:36:50] well she said I can smell it friends
[1:36:52] this house stunk so much from this thing
[1:36:55] that burnt in the house
[1:36:57] oh praise God here it is
[1:36:59] but there was one article
[1:37:02] that did not smell
[1:37:04] from that awful smell and that was a jar
[1:37:06] that had a lid on it
[1:37:09] don't you be a jar without the lid for
[1:37:11] the Lord Brother you make sure when he
[1:37:13] feels you that he really closes you up
[1:37:15] hey man
[1:37:16] puts your hand and puts it puts us in
[1:37:19] his Shekinah Glory puts the top on and
[1:37:21] you won't be affected by the things of
[1:37:23] the world
[1:37:23] it might think and it does It might
[1:37:26] smell and it does but God protects his
[1:37:29] people
[1:37:30] amen amen praise the Lord now as we
[1:37:34] bring it to a close
[1:37:36] you know again I'll just quote it for
[1:37:38] the sake of time you'll have to believe
[1:37:39] me if you don't come and see your past
[1:37:41] and he'll tell you there is a great
[1:37:45] evil Mighty spirit
[1:37:47] that's working in the world today Daniel
[1:37:50] 7 25 and it is called it talks about
[1:37:54] that the Antichrist in the end time
[1:37:56] watch this he said he will have the
[1:37:59] power to wear down the people
[1:38:03] let's turn to it just in case you are
[1:38:05] dubious
[1:38:07] um Daniel 7 25 all right this is a very
[1:38:12] strong spirit because I see it happening
[1:38:13] I go to a church I come back next time
[1:38:15] there's half there come back again
[1:38:17] there's a third there what's happening
[1:38:19] people are being
[1:38:21] tired
[1:38:22] I don't know what other words you use it
[1:38:24] says and he shall speak great things
[1:38:25] against the most high and shall wear out
[1:38:29] the signs brother
[1:38:31] we are not living in an easy time
[1:38:34] that Spirit of the age is there to wear
[1:38:36] us out
[1:38:37] to where us down to cause the society
[1:38:40] it's not worth it I have served the Lord
[1:38:42] for all these years and nothing's been
[1:38:43] happening friends serve him a little bit
[1:38:45] longer amen serve him until he says come
[1:38:48] home my good and faithful servant amen
[1:38:49] but that is a spirit thank you for
[1:38:51] bringing it up you you mark that now
[1:38:53] that is a spirit for our day because
[1:38:55] he's talking about the Antichrist Indian
[1:38:57] times it's a spirit that will wear the
[1:39:00] Saints out
[1:39:04] why don't you come to church on
[1:39:05] Wednesday well I work double shift oh
[1:39:07] why do you need the money well I've got
[1:39:09] three houses so I need to look after
[1:39:10] them and I've got six cars and I only
[1:39:12] need one that I drive and on and on
[1:39:14] friends it's wearing you out
[1:39:17] I'm not saying if you have to work go
[1:39:18] and work but watch your balance there is
[1:39:21] a spirit in the world that is affecting
[1:39:24] our message churches more so than others
[1:39:26] I don't know about others or don't go
[1:39:28] there but it's wearing us out
[1:39:30] we run running all day then when it's
[1:39:32] time to come to church we are tired
[1:39:34] Saturday night is a party it's a
[1:39:36] birthday party we have to go and visit
[1:39:38] this one nothing wrong with that don't
[1:39:39] don't think I'm saying anything against
[1:39:41] it but it's wearing us out
[1:39:44] and then we come to God say ask him
[1:39:47] yeah I suppose brother Ben preached okay
[1:39:49] he was all right ah it was really good
[1:39:52] for that sister I really knew he he's
[1:39:53] going to strike at half for her friends
[1:39:56] is for all of us
[1:39:58] don't be war or don't feel worn out a
[1:40:01] Saints it says so that's you and I
[1:40:03] that's the spirit of the age you know
[1:40:05] what another Spirit of the age is one
[1:40:07] turn to it you'll find it in your
[1:40:08] scripture
[1:40:09] it says that the gold
[1:40:12] the gold that has a nice glistening
[1:40:15] color
[1:40:17] and appearance it says that the gold
[1:40:19] will be tarnished
[1:40:23] tarnished you know what that means the
[1:40:25] shine probably just like my wedding ring
[1:40:27] that I've had for 37 years is going to
[1:40:30] be tarnished but it's still in the
[1:40:31] wedding ring but you know the goal that
[1:40:33] we should be is that what we are in his
[1:40:35] eyes friends it says in I won't tell you
[1:40:38] because I want you to look for it it
[1:40:40] says it will be tarnished it says it's
[1:40:43] the children of God
[1:40:44] sons of God
[1:40:47] is that happening perhaps
[1:40:49] you come years later where's his brother
[1:40:51] oh he's left
[1:40:53] and on and on I won't talk about that
[1:40:56] um you know Matthew Matthew 24 there's
[1:40:59] another actually we better turn to it
[1:41:00] and put it up uh whoever's doing the
[1:41:02] overheads please Matthew 24 watch this
[1:41:05] end time spirit
[1:41:06] and Friends these are not just Concepts
[1:41:09] these are not things that preachers
[1:41:11] preach about these are spirits that are
[1:41:14] uh uh are attacking
[1:41:17] not so much the world but you and I
[1:41:21] you see the devil's got no business at
[1:41:23] attacking his own because they are his
[1:41:26] it's like one person had a dream and um
[1:41:29] she she dreamed it was a woman usually a
[1:41:31] woman dream I don't know why more than
[1:41:33] men
[1:41:34] supposed to be Daydream and I actually
[1:41:35] dream during the night
[1:41:37] and uh she dreamed that she had she saw
[1:41:43] a Catholic again I've got nothing
[1:41:45] against Catholics don't get me wrong a
[1:41:46] Catholic if they believe in Jesus Christ
[1:41:48] they'll be saved a message person that
[1:41:50] believes in Jesus Christ will be saved
[1:41:52] they won't be saved because they're
[1:41:53] coming to a message Church let's get
[1:41:54] that right I think brother Ben explains
[1:41:55] that to you nicely okay it is your
[1:41:57] experience with the law that matters but
[1:41:59] she had a dream and she saw the devil
[1:42:02] sleeping on the steeple which is that
[1:42:05] thing there on the Catholic Church
[1:42:07] usually he was just sleeping on the top
[1:42:09] and then at the same time she had
[1:42:12] another dream that there was another
[1:42:13] church in that City where she was and
[1:42:16] the devil was very busy every Sunday
[1:42:19] morning coming to the door and and
[1:42:21] putting different thoughts into people's
[1:42:23] minds and everything and she said I
[1:42:25] don't understand
[1:42:26] why is the devil sleeping there and why
[1:42:28] is he so busy in the real Church of
[1:42:29] Jesus Christ
[1:42:31] and then the lord gave her the
[1:42:33] explanation
[1:42:34] she said my daughter
[1:42:35] they are his
[1:42:37] he doesn't have to do anything they're
[1:42:38] his whether they go to church or the pub
[1:42:40] or the wherever they go there he is he
[1:42:43] said but he's there where the Lord is
[1:42:45] working doing something amen friends
[1:42:47] that's why you and I are getting
[1:42:50] attacked by the enemy these days more
[1:42:52] than any other church around us that's
[1:42:55] why there are spirits that are coming
[1:42:56] that are trying to inject all sorts of
[1:42:59] teachings and and and and uh
[1:43:02] understandings and explanations you know
[1:43:05] what friends many times we miss the
[1:43:09] message of the message
[1:43:10] the message was not sent for us to
[1:43:12] debate over and interpret and for
[1:43:14] brother Ben to get here and give you a
[1:43:16] new teaching every morning the message
[1:43:18] was sent to bring us back to the
[1:43:20] original
[1:43:20] and if we use it for that wonderful you
[1:43:23] know what I believe I believe that if we
[1:43:25] all adhere to the message the way it was
[1:43:27] delivered there would be one Church
[1:43:28] brother there would be one little group
[1:43:30] and there'll be no issues I could come
[1:43:33] here or I could go to Gisborne or
[1:43:34] anywhere else and feel right at home but
[1:43:37] Francis human interpretation sorry I'm
[1:43:39] getting sidetracked but we'll get to it
[1:43:40] I'm getting you know this human
[1:43:42] interpretation that people put onto it
[1:43:44] we call that a spin
[1:43:46] you know spin a little bit it looks like
[1:43:49] this but brother I think I better put a
[1:43:51] little spin I spoke about this on Sunday
[1:43:53] I've got to continue with this thought
[1:43:55] on next Sunday I'll just put my own
[1:43:57] little spin
[1:43:58] this and see people
[1:44:00] you know what there is not a single
[1:44:02] person right here or perhaps in the city
[1:44:04] of Wellington that thinks they are wrong
[1:44:06] they all think they're serving God they
[1:44:09] all think they are right
[1:44:10] but friends there's another Spirit which
[1:44:12] we just turned to in Matthew 24 and that
[1:44:15] is a spirit of deception it's mentioned
[1:44:17] there three times it says be careful in
[1:44:20] verse 5 saying I'm Christ and shall
[1:44:23] deceive many
[1:44:26] okay first time then in verse
[1:44:30] 11
[1:44:32] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[1:44:35] deceive many not one or two but many
[1:44:39] okay let's go further verse 24 if it
[1:44:42] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:44:45] very elect
[1:44:46] three times the words came is mentioned
[1:44:50] right in the same time brother the
[1:44:52] deception wasn't so great during Martin
[1:44:54] Luther they sort of had a more black and
[1:44:56] white you know you believe or you don't
[1:44:57] and that's it but today there's so many
[1:44:59] deceptions
[1:45:01] the devil is using every possible means
[1:45:03] the the media the computers the whatever
[1:45:06] you have
[1:45:08] just deception yeah it's called Uh back
[1:45:12] home they call it con um conspiracy
[1:45:15] theory
[1:45:16] I have a certain person whom I know well
[1:45:18] back home I wouldn't again mention the
[1:45:19] name but soon as covert came my did she
[1:45:22] get right into it just about every day
[1:45:24] she's sending some conspiracy theory on
[1:45:27] her hair she said she didn't even talk
[1:45:29] to me but she just kept on sending it in
[1:45:31] the end I just didn't even look at it
[1:45:33] friends there's no into it the devil
[1:45:35] will use anything to deceive the people
[1:45:37] it doesn't matter whether you love sport
[1:45:40] whether you love alcohol whether you are
[1:45:41] living wrong whether you are not serving
[1:45:44] God the way you should as long as the
[1:45:46] devil has he has you in his hands
[1:45:48] friends he's happy with that
[1:45:50] and it's going on and on and three years
[1:45:52] later if I showed you my mobile phone
[1:45:54] these hundreds and hundreds but it's
[1:45:56] amazing she never sent anything positive
[1:45:59] about covert or anything good it was
[1:46:01] always the negative the negative the
[1:46:02] negative and negative and if I was
[1:46:04] inclined that way and if I sort of gave
[1:46:06] in to it I would have to come back to
[1:46:07] and say sister hope this is an awful
[1:46:09] world we live in this is an awful thing
[1:46:11] that's happening no I just disregarded
[1:46:14] because I know what the word says covert
[1:46:16] or no covert friends let's serve the
[1:46:18] Lord I don't know what you believe about
[1:46:20] covert but France I believe that was
[1:46:21] only a small foretaste of the what an
[1:46:23] enemy put out just to see how he can get
[1:46:26] the whole world whether he came from
[1:46:28] China or America Australia or New
[1:46:30] Zealand doesn't matter but the whole
[1:46:32] world was caught up in it and you know
[1:46:34] what was the catch word
[1:46:36] it wasn't God it was covered yeah
[1:46:39] how many new words have we got about 20
[1:46:41] new words locked down uh and on and on
[1:46:44] that's became a new dictionary brother a
[1:46:48] new catchphrase a new buzzword as they
[1:46:50] call it yep wasn't it for two years 2020
[1:46:53] back home until maybe six months ago it
[1:46:56] was all about coven did you get it are
[1:46:59] you scared did you get injected what
[1:47:01] happens if it happens to you oh look at
[1:47:03] the consequences oh look at this one got
[1:47:04] it and they died and look at this one
[1:47:06] they've got a heart attack and
[1:47:07] everything
[1:47:07] friends that was a little Prelude
[1:47:11] of the pressure and the squeeze was
[1:47:13] going to come or globally on the Bride
[1:47:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:47:17] we better be ready
[1:47:19] this is kind of she's come and gone
[1:47:22] but these uh there's a greater squeeze
[1:47:24] that's coming
[1:47:25] all right so in there okay I did turn to
[1:47:29] Matthew 24 sorry I I got sidetracked
[1:47:31] you're such a nice people to talk to

[1:47:35] amen Corners around so I just feel right

[1:48:29] I don't know where I was on that date
[1:48:31] but they've kept it in their heart they
[1:48:34] harbored it and you know what it does it
[1:48:35] causes a fence
[1:48:37] where are most of the message churches
[1:48:39] uh people in message churches today
[1:48:41] they're offended
[1:48:42] they're not coming to church they're
[1:48:43] staying at home because you said
[1:48:45] something it's something that they don't
[1:48:47] agree with that's what causes offense so
[1:48:50] we're living an age of offense
[1:48:53] that's the subject in itself maybe
[1:48:54] brother Ben can take it up listen go it
[1:48:56] goes further and shall betray one
[1:48:59] another
[1:49:01] when I offend his brother it's very easy
[1:49:04] for him to betray me so I don't even
[1:49:07] know brother Michael I don't have
[1:49:08] anything to do with him and he talks to
[1:49:09] me roughly and so forth It's the
[1:49:11] Betrayal you know what it is a betrayal
[1:49:13] of Christian love and fellowship and
[1:49:15] unity that should be there ah but
[1:49:17] there's one more brother Michael
[1:49:19] and shall hate one another
[1:49:23] you talk about a hate-filled generation
[1:49:27] yeah get on the road stranger that you
[1:49:30] don't know look at him this way and bang
[1:49:32] you've got to smash something coming
[1:49:33] through your glass through your window
[1:49:35] the hatred
[1:49:37] I hate you I don't even know who I am
[1:49:39] what did I do wrong with you I've been
[1:49:41] praying for you and you hate me why you
[1:49:43] see it's a hate-filled generation for it
[1:49:45] these are real spirits that are
[1:49:47] affecting the people outside and unless
[1:49:50] we had our borders around us they are
[1:49:52] trying and they are coming a little bit
[1:49:55] at a time into a messy Church on this
[1:49:58] first floor
[1:50:00] hey maybe the government doesn't know
[1:50:02] where you are but the devil knows your
[1:50:04] address
[1:50:05] I think I'll call it is probably one one
[1:50:08] three I think there's a big number there
[1:50:10] he says demons
[1:50:12] cohorts imps
[1:50:15] on Sunday morning make sure you are
[1:50:17] there at nine o'clock before they turn
[1:50:18] up because they believe they should be
[1:50:20] here at 9 30 brother Ben I think I'm
[1:50:23] preaching the truth here now
[1:50:24] come there at nine o'clock someone will
[1:50:26] come to musicians will come and they'll
[1:50:28] just start playing and they just won't
[1:50:29] get the song right and this will be
[1:50:30] upset and on and on they're starting to
[1:50:33] work
[1:50:34] brother Bennett comes under the
[1:50:35] anointing of the Holy Spirit comes out
[1:50:36] of that office ready to preach the word
[1:50:38] friends and you are already oh seething
[1:50:42] you know what that means yeah
[1:50:44] all right seething all right
[1:50:47] whatever I suppose that's a word that we
[1:50:49] use in English all right so we're
[1:50:51] finishing soon
[1:50:53] and I want you to turn to this and put
[1:50:54] it up brother
[1:50:56] so I'm talking about
[1:50:59] spirits that are working
[1:51:02] and that are really really doing
[1:51:04] whatever they can to destroy the work of
[1:51:08] the Lord in this end time in air time in
[1:51:12] our message that we are so jealousful
[1:51:15] when you came to the message you would
[1:51:17] you probably said to yourself my this is
[1:51:19] just such a truth I would even die for
[1:51:20] it
[1:51:21] now
[1:51:23] you don't even look at it
[1:51:25] and you have it on your mobile phone the
[1:51:27] whole table or whatever which one you
[1:51:29] got it's a matter of pressing three
[1:51:31] buttons and you're right there listening
[1:51:32] to the message
[1:51:33] but no there's news
[1:51:35] ah but these current news ah these
[1:51:38] worldwide news oh there was an
[1:51:39] earthquake oh there was a tsunami oh
[1:51:42] there was a tornado oh that was a mass
[1:51:44] shooting
[1:51:45] you know how many the way in America
[1:51:47] this year mass shooting is anything over
[1:51:49] I think three or four people according
[1:51:51] to the account
[1:51:52] 279 mass shootings this year in the
[1:51:55] country called America which was a Godly
[1:51:57] country
[1:51:58] over three and plus another one just got
[1:52:00] shot nine Prince I don't dwell on that
[1:52:03] but listen if you keep on feeding on
[1:52:05] that that spirit is just there's
[1:52:08] something that's sort of attracting you
[1:52:10] to it yeah that's right yeah so all I'm
[1:52:11] telling you I'm just telling you a fact
[1:52:12] so you don't have to look for it don't
[1:52:13] go Googling because when you come home
[1:52:15] just take my word for it
[1:52:17] that's the spirit that's in the age
[1:52:20] 335 million people in the city in the
[1:52:22] country of America and so many shootings
[1:52:26] people are being killed every day every
[1:52:29] day
[1:52:31] you don't is that a normal spirit
[1:52:34] no I think it's an unnormal Spirit
[1:52:38] second Peter two I'll come and finish on
[1:52:40] the spiritual side of things and we'll
[1:52:42] need to finish
[1:52:44] all right listen to this now preachers
[1:52:46] don't usually preach from this chapter I
[1:52:49] hope your brother your pastor and your
[1:52:51] ministers do because it's a very Tatty
[1:52:53] chapter it's very direct it's very uh
[1:52:58] real and you say brother Michael no no
[1:53:00] you got it wrong Don't Preach this to us
[1:53:02] go to the Pentecostals and assemblies in
[1:53:04] UPC and others and preacher they no
[1:53:07] friends I'm not interested in them
[1:53:08] because I know that those Devils I was
[1:53:10] describing about they are here on Sunday
[1:53:12] morning at 9 30 ready to fill your mind
[1:53:15] with something that's right ah that song
[1:53:17] later he's always got the same songs
[1:53:19] can't he choose something else look what
[1:53:21] they're saying in America why don't we
[1:53:22] just join in and sing some new choruses
[1:53:25] well you get one of your people anointed
[1:53:27] and let them write the songs then you
[1:53:28] sing those songs which I believe you do
[1:53:30] brother Isaac yeah so he's already got
[1:53:33] you something
[1:53:34] and brother Ben he's going to come again
[1:53:36] and he's going to give us part six of
[1:53:38] the sermon that he started five weeks
[1:53:40] ago come on there must be something new
[1:53:41] brother Ben haven't you gone on the
[1:53:43] internet and see what others are
[1:53:44] preaching oh yes he's in touch with it
[1:53:49] the Juana that's above
[1:53:50] you know AI it's a new buzzword
[1:53:53] oh everything say hi watch it there it's
[1:53:56] going to start controlling our lives and
[1:53:58] the way they present that looks pretty
[1:53:59] scary brother is going to come in in my
[1:54:01] bank take all my money not do this much
[1:54:03] there so it's wasting time am I going to
[1:54:05] brother Ben's but you know if I reckon
[1:54:08] if the AI I've got a brother-in-law who
[1:54:10] knows about these things if AI merges
[1:54:13] with the common internet we're all in
[1:54:16] trouble
[1:54:18] but you know what God had it first
[1:54:21] yeah sure
[1:54:22] AI Almighty intelligence
[1:54:24] go to Judges chapter five six and seven
[1:54:27] and God was dealing with a city called
[1:54:29] AI That's right where was that City she
[1:54:33] was in the valley where is our Silicon
[1:54:36] Valley right in the valley what happened
[1:54:38] to AI it was burned by fire what's going
[1:54:42] to happen to California and that west
[1:54:44] side of America she will be burned by
[1:54:46] fire
[1:54:47] friends God had it first
[1:54:49] yeah so I'd rather spend time with this
[1:54:51] than trying to figure out something on
[1:54:53] you know that's right so chapter two uh
[1:54:58] second Peter two listen to this but
[1:55:00] there were false prophets also among the
[1:55:03] people all you can say about the fault
[1:55:06] preacher about false prophet brother
[1:55:07] Michael
[1:55:07] hey if there's a true one there's false
[1:55:10] ones we can you listen to this listen to
[1:55:13] the way the gods wisdom put put it even
[1:55:15] as there shall be false teachers
[1:55:18] didn't say prophets but teachers
[1:55:21] how many of us preach the teachers have
[1:55:22] we got today everybody preaching their
[1:55:24] own thoughts their ideas their
[1:55:26] interpretation their interpretation of
[1:55:28] the message and it's not even theirs I
[1:55:30] had an experience one with one brother
[1:55:31] and I said brother I'm coming to your
[1:55:33] house and you tell me everything you
[1:55:35] want why we are different than why we
[1:55:37] can't Fellowship together
[1:55:38] he said okay I'll do that I came there
[1:55:40] we started talking and he said now I've
[1:55:42] got to ring America to get first-hand
[1:55:45] evidence of things I'm talking about
[1:55:46] from someone else I said brother that
[1:55:48] wasn't the deal I came to your house and
[1:55:50] you were going to tell me why we are
[1:55:51] different oh he said but he can explain
[1:55:53] it better I said listen I won't be
[1:55:55] judged on the day of judgment what
[1:55:57] brother in America so so said I'll be
[1:55:59] judged by what the word says
[1:56:01] and in the end after about 45 minutes of
[1:56:03] talking brother there was about three
[1:56:05] things that divided us one was an
[1:56:07] interpretation of Greek word which I and
[1:56:09] he doesn't know what it means anyway the
[1:56:11] other one was something insignificant
[1:56:12] and the third thing is not even worth
[1:56:14] mentioning because I've forgotten
[1:56:16] so that's how much divided us for 20
[1:56:19] years he kept his Fellowship away from
[1:56:22] the other fellowships in Sydney
[1:56:24] and you know what happened
[1:56:27] tell you what happened
[1:56:29] most
[1:56:31] of those people in that Fellowship
[1:56:33] disappeared
[1:56:36] someone to the world some married and
[1:56:38] went somewhere else some backslid many
[1:56:41] of them died and I did say when I go
[1:56:43] back which was a beautiful Fellowship
[1:56:44] about 70 80 people there's probably
[1:56:46] about a dozen
[1:56:48] because he kept it to himself friends
[1:56:50] we are to have fellowship with whosoever
[1:56:53] Will amen but not with the unfruitful
[1:56:55] works of darkness
[1:56:57] but be an example yeah these others that
[1:57:00] don't want to but you say brother why
[1:57:01] not come from fellowship Fellowship
[1:57:03] won't hurt you and then you what you
[1:57:05] when it comes in and the word works on
[1:57:06] him he'll be a different brother
[1:57:09] so there were false teachers among you
[1:57:10] who private privilege means privately or
[1:57:13] in a secret manner rather shall bring in
[1:57:16] damnable heresies even denying the Lord
[1:57:20] that brought them and bring upon
[1:57:22] themselves with destruction
[1:57:24] they teaching right now to say that the
[1:57:26] Lord Jesus Christ we've done away with
[1:57:28] done away with his blood in the cross
[1:57:30] brother Ben you've probably heard it and
[1:57:32] then on and on and on what does the
[1:57:33] scripture say here deny the Lord that
[1:57:36] brought them
[1:57:37] so the very Lord Jesus that saved them
[1:57:39] now they're saying they don't need him
[1:57:41] France it's something's gone wrong
[1:57:44] something's done around about turn yeah
[1:57:47] and listen to go let's go further and
[1:57:49] many shall follow their pernicious ways
[1:57:52] that's all right it's not a big word you
[1:57:54] know what pernicious means I'll explain
[1:57:56] it to you and you'll know for the rest
[1:57:57] of your life now
[1:57:58] highly injurious or destructive
[1:58:02] in the highly injurious or destructive
[1:58:05] way let's go further tending to fatal
[1:58:08] issue and deadly harmful effect
[1:58:14] brother Michael can my words have that
[1:58:17] upon someone else absolutely
[1:58:19] if I came here with the wrong motive if
[1:58:20] I came here to proselyte if I came here
[1:58:22] to get some money if I came here just to
[1:58:24] see what I can teach in France and I'm
[1:58:26] not based on the word then my motive is
[1:58:28] wrong it's deceitful and it's it's fatal
[1:58:32] issues and it's deadly ah especially I
[1:58:35] like this thank God for a good
[1:58:37] dictionary Webster is all right you
[1:58:38] don't know a Webster was a Christian by
[1:58:40] the way yeah sure
[1:58:43] I don't know this is Webster one of you
[1:58:44] others but it doesn't matter
[1:58:46] especially in gradual and subtle manner
[1:58:51] wow
[1:58:53] so I don't come here wants to convert
[1:58:55] you all and take you away from this
[1:58:56] Fellowship I come progressively I come
[1:58:59] slowly I come with another agenda in my
[1:59:03] pocket I come to see if I can slip one
[1:59:05] in as brother Branham said he said they
[1:59:07] they put the something on the bait he
[1:59:09] said they throw it in he said the fish
[1:59:12] catches it and he said then they Jerk It
[1:59:15] France I'm not that sort of a Preacher I
[1:59:17] didn't come for that reason
[1:59:18] but I came here to tell you that the
[1:59:20] word says pernicious means uh gradual
[1:59:24] and subtle manner
[1:59:27] how many have left our fellowships
[1:59:29] worldwide because of other teachers that
[1:59:32] came subtly and gradually and worked on
[1:59:34] them and worked on them and showed them
[1:59:36] greater light just like Eve and where
[1:59:39] are they today they're in the world
[1:59:41] would have been better for them not to
[1:59:42] have known the truth they've lost their
[1:59:44] children they lost their families they
[1:59:45] lost their husbands they lost their
[1:59:46] wives uh and on and on and on that's
[1:59:49] right I've seen it I know myself I know
[1:59:52] one sister
[1:59:53] she was so precious little sister I mean
[1:59:56] short sister and had a daughter called
[1:59:59] one better not saying and she listened
[2:00:01] to brother Reginald sales tapes
[2:00:04] she listened to him for many years
[2:00:07] never met him
[2:00:09] and brother Rachel was in Melbourne with
[2:00:11] me and I said brother sister I'm going
[2:00:13] to bring the brother that you've been
[2:00:15] listening to for many years on tape so
[2:00:17] you can come and see you oh she's a
[2:00:19] brother that would be wonderful I just
[2:00:20] have not seen that man I took him there
[2:00:23] we had Fellowship white told him about
[2:00:24] middle of the night the sister was
[2:00:26] really encouraged and strong and so
[2:00:28] forth a few years later I found out that
[2:00:32] she's left the message gone her own way
[2:00:34] she was she left her first husband
[2:00:37] because the husband left her because she
[2:00:39] became a Believer now she went back and
[2:00:42] went into the world brother and married
[2:00:43] another unbeliever
[2:00:45] absolutely
[2:00:47] you talk about gradual and receptive
[2:00:50] manner of
[2:00:52] she was feeding on something wrong
[2:00:54] and some of you that are failing on a
[2:00:56] certain thing on the internet
[2:00:58] raise it
[2:01:00] don't read it because friends anything
[2:01:02] that we feed on sooner or later it
[2:01:04] becomes a part of us
[2:01:06] amen so we don't need to come on Sunday
[2:01:10] and discuss and say listen did you see
[2:01:11] the latest one such and such I won't
[2:01:13] mention it because then I'm giving you
[2:01:14] I'm giving seed to that I don't want it
[2:01:16] just leave it
[2:01:18] friends if we haven't got enough truth
[2:01:20] and if we don't know what the truth is
[2:01:22] then
[2:01:23] forget about the internet
[2:01:25] we have it all
[2:01:27] right now so you know the word punishes
[2:01:29] they had this young sister will remember
[2:01:30] that big word that you never knew
[2:01:32] gradual and subtle manner of deception
[2:01:36] back to deception brother listen to this
[2:01:39] chapter verse 3 and through covetousness
[2:01:42] that means a bit of money behind that
[2:01:45] shall they with find words make
[2:01:49] merchandise of you
[2:01:53] make merchandise of you
[2:01:57] how much can I grab out of this one how
[2:01:59] much can I grab out of this one how much
[2:02:01] can I you know pull
[2:02:03] through my preaching merchandise means
[2:02:04] making business that's what it means
[2:02:06] making business okay now the word feign
[2:02:09] it means to pretend and to be insincere
[2:02:13] it means listen to this sense of hiding
[2:02:17] true feelings and emotions
[2:02:20] by presenting something else
[2:02:25] so I'm hiding the truth
[2:02:27] but I've got a hidden agenda
[2:02:29] that's what these teachers are I'm still
[2:02:31] talking about the end time teachers and
[2:02:33] on and on okay I think it's just a good
[2:02:35] example we just mainly there's another
[2:02:37] one there in Ezekiel we'll have just
[2:02:38] quote for the sake of time it says no
[2:02:41] I've got to turn to it because you need
[2:02:43] to remember it amen it's nothing like
[2:02:45] turning to the old printed Bible amen ah
[2:02:48] you can have it on uh on your mobile
[2:02:50] phone and so forth but let's turn to it
[2:02:52] Ezekiel 33. it's something better you
[2:02:55] know why I'm so proud of my Bible and
[2:02:57] why I appreciate it and why I don't have
[2:02:59] any other uh things except written
[2:03:01] things because I'll give you a secret
[2:03:03] I'm a printer by trade so I've got to
[2:03:07] support my printing trade I'm not I eat
[2:03:10] I'm not an I.T rather another I'm still
[2:03:12] a printer I was a printer rather when I
[2:03:14] started my apprenticeship and I just
[2:03:16] believe it's good to get this brother
[2:03:19] Brown said have you got your Bibles he
[2:03:21] said very good he said let's have a look
[2:03:22] let's open them and let's read there is
[2:03:25] something about to him that heareth
[2:03:27] listen to this and read us the words of
[2:03:30] this prophecy
[2:03:31] hey man don't just listen to it say to
[2:03:34] yourself
[2:03:35] it's just a double entry point hearing
[2:03:38] and looking Ezekiel 33 I know I believe
[2:03:43] the time is
[2:03:44] time to finish so I will listen to this
[2:03:47] beautiful verses but again it's for our
[2:03:49] day
[2:03:51] and I'm talking about have you got a
[2:03:53] spot in your heart I'm just going to get
[2:03:55] to it as I finish now listen to this
[2:03:57] Ezekiel 33 will start from 31.
[2:04:01] and they shall come unto you as the
[2:04:04] people that do come I'm just sort of
[2:04:07] paraphrasing it a little bit just to
[2:04:08] show that this King James version is not
[2:04:09] too hard after all
[2:04:11] they sit before you as my people
[2:04:16] when brother gets on Sunday morning
[2:04:19] you sit here in front of him as God's
[2:04:22] people not Ben's people but as God's
[2:04:23] people
[2:04:24] right and brother Ben's ready to preach
[2:04:27] and they hear your words
[2:04:30] brother Ben that was wonderful
[2:04:32] that was good brother Ben what did he
[2:04:34] say
[2:04:35] oh I'm not sure if I forgot I better I
[2:04:38] don't have anything written down I think
[2:04:39] I forgot what he said and you didn't
[2:04:41] even go out of the church yet
[2:04:42] happens we are you know humans that are
[2:04:46] not very good retaining some things that
[2:04:49] we don't want to retain amen I'll put it
[2:04:51] that way but they uh sorry they will
[2:04:54] hear your words but they will not do
[2:04:57] them
[2:04:59] so God places something with brother
[2:05:00] Ben's heart he comes here he Thunders
[2:05:02] and he preaches for an hour and a half
[2:05:03] and you say praise the Lord that was off
[2:05:05] the Lord that was really for me you
[2:05:07] heard it but you're not ready to do them
[2:05:09] for with their mouth they show much love
[2:05:13] but their heart goes after their
[2:05:18] covetousness the heart is deceitful
[2:05:20] Above All Things
[2:05:22] who can know what the scripture says so
[2:05:25] they hear it it sounds good they're
[2:05:27] ready to sing about it but they go their
[2:05:30] own way we're not there yet not at the
[2:05:32] end and lo you are unto them a very
[2:05:35] lovely song
[2:05:37] that was a beautiful sermon wow I don't
[2:05:40] think we heard this anywhere in the
[2:05:41] world today and the way it was presented
[2:05:43] very lovely song and of one that has a
[2:05:46] pleasant voice and can play well on an
[2:05:49] instrument but they hear thy words but
[2:05:53] they to not do them
[2:05:57] is it possible that it's a prophecy for
[2:05:59] today
[2:06:01] that's all right bring in the next verse
[2:06:03] brother
[2:06:05] and what is an end
[2:06:07] a conjunction it binds the whole thing
[2:06:10] together and
[2:06:12] when this comes to pass in 19
[2:06:17] 2023 on the 31st of
[2:06:21] May the last day of autumn
[2:06:24] it's falling the leaves are falling
[2:06:26] Winter's coming and when this comes to
[2:06:27] pass and it will
[2:06:30] for long it will come then shall they
[2:06:34] know that a prophet has been amongst
[2:06:37] them
[2:06:38] if that's not the picture of the message
[2:06:39] movement generally what is
[2:06:42] don't you touch that oh there's very
[2:06:45] special oh I love that voice oh when I
[2:06:47] hear that voice I can just fall asleep
[2:06:49] and just oh just wonderful that's
[2:06:51] exactly right what's the effect of it
[2:06:54] and when you understand that these words
[2:06:57] are so beautiful and sweet and they'll
[2:06:59] know that a prophet has been amongst
[2:07:00] them
[2:07:01] come and gone brothers and sisters 60
[2:07:03] odd years come and gone
[2:07:05] we're a lot further than that
[2:07:07] amen amen so let's allow him to remove
[2:07:11] every spot I'll read that quote might
[2:07:14] give you one more story if time permits
[2:07:16] and then I'll finish listen to this
[2:07:20] one of these days if you haven't already
[2:07:23] you'll and I'm not scaring you now
[2:07:25] please get me wrong don't get me wrong
[2:07:27] but we need to sound warning we need to
[2:07:30] preach the truth friends because it is
[2:07:32] for everybody it's as much as it is for
[2:07:34] me as much as it is for you you don't
[2:07:36] know what I'm going through back home
[2:07:37] you don't know what issues I have you
[2:07:39] don't know how holy I am and so forth
[2:07:41] neither do I know about you but he does
[2:07:44] and one of these days if you haven't
[2:07:45] already you'll cross that line You'll
[2:07:49] Never desire no more to do what's right
[2:07:51] did you hear what I said
[2:07:54] what did he say you'll never decide to
[2:07:57] do what's right it's a matter of brother
[2:07:58] sister do you realize what has been said
[2:08:01] you'll cross that line and you'll never
[2:08:05] want to do it again you'll still hear
[2:08:08] the gospel
[2:08:10] you'll still come on Sunday and listen
[2:08:12] but you'll never accept it you can't
[2:08:15] accept it and all and on I just don't
[2:08:16] want to go too far friends
[2:08:19] there are people that have heard this
[2:08:22] message all their lives
[2:08:23] and right now towards the end instead of
[2:08:25] being on fervent and on Zeal more for
[2:08:28] God than ever before they've walked away
[2:08:30] from it and said there's nothing to it
[2:08:32] and that's it
[2:08:34] where do they get that from
[2:08:36] from the internet
[2:08:37] what spirit is feeding him that Spirit
[2:08:40] that's behind that
[2:08:42] on and on um I'll leave the brother Ben
[2:08:44] to preach but that's the truth anyway
[2:08:45] now listen to this
[2:08:47] while you continue singing I want to ask
[2:08:50] you something is there a spot in your
[2:08:54] heart
[2:08:55] that's what I've brought you to now I
[2:08:57] didn't bring you to another new message
[2:08:58] or something else to tantalize your ears
[2:09:00] and senses but I brought you to this is
[2:09:03] there a spot in your heart that seems to
[2:09:05] be darkened by sin
[2:09:08] if it is now is the time to get rid of
[2:09:11] it right now
[2:09:13] friends
[2:09:14] if I've said nothing please remember
[2:09:16] that and if there is if you've got any
[2:09:19] Darkness on your life won't you come
[2:09:22] right here around the alternator while
[2:09:25] we continue to sing right now if there
[2:09:28] is a spot don't put it off any longer
[2:09:31] yeah yeah God's speaking to all of us we
[2:09:34] all have spots we all have imperfections
[2:09:35] we all have shortcomings we all have
[2:09:37] things that shouldn't be there friends
[2:09:39] now is the time to react in your own way
[2:09:42] and finally said Lord Jesus I've done
[2:09:45] the best that I know how I've done all
[2:09:47] that I know how Grand Lord that the
[2:09:50] mercy doors are still open
[2:09:53] of these hundreds literally hundreds
[2:09:56] seeking thee at this time at the altar
[2:09:59] take away every sinful blot Lord and
[2:10:03] take them in today
[2:10:05] friends we have some of those spots
[2:10:09] let the Holy Spirit work on us
[2:10:11] and let's really come to a new love
[2:10:15] relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:10:17] don't let it be just words but let's
[2:10:20] start acting let's start assimilating
[2:10:23] I don't know what that word means so
[2:10:25] when you go home young ones you can go
[2:10:27] on the computer for that and find out
[2:10:28] what it means
[2:10:29] assimilate I do know what it means I
[2:10:31] shouldn't be
[2:10:32] sarcastic
[2:10:34] let's love him more than ever before
[2:10:37] amen let me say this story a true story
[2:10:42] rather a true happening and finish many
[2:10:45] other things but anyway I think you've
[2:10:47] got you've got the gist of offered what
[2:10:48] I was trying to say
[2:10:49] amen what sport have I and you have in
[2:10:54] our lives
[2:10:56] that was a man listen to me young ones
[2:10:58] just before you fall asleep
[2:11:00] true story
[2:11:01] said and spoken by a man the brother
[2:11:03] Branham prayed for and the brother
[2:11:05] Branham said that he had uh certificates
[2:11:07] to plaster the whole wall
[2:11:09] so much so when brother Brenham started
[2:11:11] speaking to him he fell over the desk
[2:11:13] it's all in the message I'll give you
[2:11:15] his name his name is Paris reedhead read
[2:11:18] him a very powerful preacher back in the
[2:11:21] 50s and 60s and 70s and had a lot of
[2:11:23] contact with brother Branham that's the
[2:11:25] one that said brother Branham I don't
[2:11:26] think I have the Holy Ghost I've got all
[2:11:28] these certificates it's not helping me
[2:11:29] and he said brother Graham said he got
[2:11:31] the Holy Ghost and he was a different
[2:11:33] man thereafter and this is the example
[2:11:35] he said sometimes look sometimes it's
[2:11:36] good to know that background all right
[2:11:38] so we're not plucking it out of air and
[2:11:40] and so forth but it's a real man that
[2:11:42] had contact with brother Branham quite a
[2:11:44] lot
[2:11:44] favorite
[2:11:47] 1956 sorry 1856
[2:11:50] 170 odd years ago there was a prospector
[2:11:54] a gold prospector
[2:11:56] that went left England and went to
[2:11:59] America
[2:12:00] and he went there for a number of years
[2:12:02] and he earned a fair bit of money
[2:12:04] prospecting or looking for gold
[2:12:07] and it was his last day in America he
[2:12:09] was in the State of Florida right down
[2:12:12] the bottom there on the east side of
[2:12:15] America where the ships were sailing
[2:12:17] from Florida back to England
[2:12:20] he had a couple of hours to twice so he
[2:12:23] was addressed however he left his dirty
[2:12:27] gold miners boots on
[2:12:30] we call you know they were really dirty
[2:12:33] for some reason he still had them on
[2:12:35] he he gets his suitcase he's got
[2:12:37] everything ready the ship's leaving it
[2:12:38] in the afternoon he has got a couple of
[2:12:40] hours to waste he goes past a certain
[2:12:43] Gathering
[2:12:44] and while he's in that Gathering walking
[2:12:47] past he hears a lot of noise
[2:12:49] so how what's going on he said I've got
[2:12:51] a bit of time let me see what's going on
[2:12:53] there so he comes through the back door
[2:12:55] he comes in and it's an auction
[2:12:59] an auction is a place where they sell
[2:13:01] things here they were selling people
[2:13:04] they were called slaves African slaves
[2:13:06] true story
[2:13:07] and as he came to the back he said I'll
[2:13:10] just see what's happening now God made
[2:13:12] man and man-made slaves it's wrong it
[2:13:15] was wrong and it's not acceptable and
[2:13:17] it's an anti-word all right we know that
[2:13:19] so don't you try to make a slave out of
[2:13:21] anyone not even your husband or Your
[2:13:22] Wife by the way all right know your
[2:13:24] children that's right
[2:13:26] and um he stands at the back right there
[2:13:30] brother
[2:13:30] and there are two men at the back that
[2:13:33] are bidding for this woman
[2:13:34] I'll make up the figure because he
[2:13:36] didn't mention the figure but not just
[2:13:37] to help you understand the two men are
[2:13:40] saying when we get this woman a slave
[2:13:42] she was banned with chains on her hands
[2:13:45] and fetches on her feet so she couldn't
[2:13:48] walk very fast and she couldn't run away
[2:13:50] so the two men at the back that were
[2:13:52] bidding that it was their final bid and
[2:13:54] the auction is looking at him right at
[2:13:55] the back and he said going once going
[2:13:58] twice he'll be Soul she'll be sold and
[2:14:01] that
[2:14:02] Gold Miner prospector something Rises
[2:14:06] within his heart
[2:14:07] doesn't know
[2:14:09] he said
[2:14:10] the man the auction he said it's going
[2:14:12] she's going for fifty dollars
[2:14:14] a human being fifty dollars friends you
[2:14:17] know how much a human being's worth for
[2:14:18] what will the prophet I mean if he gains
[2:14:20] the whole world and loses his soul
[2:14:22] brother Brown said uh our souls are
[2:14:24] worth more than ten thousand worlds
[2:14:26] there's no price on our soul and every
[2:14:29] living soul that has been born is a soul
[2:14:31] before God and has the same value
[2:14:34] equality all the way amen I wish I was
[2:14:37] around in that time brother I'd be
[2:14:39] talking against those things but anyway
[2:14:41] there's many slaves of different types
[2:14:42] that we need to talk against today so
[2:14:44] he's the auction he says she'll be sold
[2:14:47] for fifty dollars if there's no further
[2:14:49] bidding going ones go Empires going
[2:14:52] third and final call and our prospector
[2:14:55] from the back he yells out a hundred
[2:14:57] dollars
[2:14:58] stops
[2:15:00] silence people can't believe what they
[2:15:03] heard they said oh a slave has never
[2:15:05] been sold for more than ten twenty
[2:15:07] dollars these people are paying 50. and
[2:15:09] this stupid man is paying a hundred
[2:15:12] so the auctioneer before he sells the
[2:15:14] woman he says sir but do you have that
[2:15:17] that much money
[2:15:21] as well I've got to do it it's going
[2:15:23] once going twice going third and final
[2:15:26] time sold to that gentleman at the back
[2:15:29] for a hundred dollars
[2:15:31] he comes forward to the front
[2:15:33] he takes this poor woman
[2:15:36] they can barely walk he's got chains on
[2:15:37] hands and feet
[2:15:39] I've been a slave all her life
[2:15:42] he takes outside of the auctioneering
[2:15:44] room
[2:15:45] and the woman looks at him
[2:15:47] the first thing she does she spits in
[2:15:49] his face
[2:15:50] she's only known hatred and abused
[2:15:52] Prince all her life she spits in his
[2:15:55] face
[2:15:56] he being a gentleman he took his slave
[2:15:58] like this
[2:15:59] and he just wiped it off not a word
[2:16:02] and she says I hate you
[2:16:05] I hate you but I want to be a slave I
[2:16:08] hate you why did you buy me
[2:16:10] you didn't say a word
[2:16:12] and he wasn't a Christian
[2:16:13] he just took her along
[2:16:15] went to the office across the road and
[2:16:18] you you used to get what we call a bill
[2:16:20] of emancipation
[2:16:21] yeah yeah which some of you know it was
[2:16:23] just a bill to say that that person is
[2:16:25] yours you have a title deed like you
[2:16:27] have for a house or a car oh that you I
[2:16:30] think I call it a warrant here and she's
[2:16:31] yours
[2:16:33] so he goes across to the office there
[2:16:35] and he says
[2:16:37] can I have the papers I bought her
[2:16:41] and the clerk in the office looks at it
[2:16:43] and he says sir there's a mistake here
[2:16:46] you paid a hundred dollars we've never
[2:16:48] paid that much for a slave it's a
[2:16:50] mistake
[2:16:51] he said I bought her but do you have
[2:16:54] that much money
[2:16:58] the papers
[2:17:00] if he gives him the key
[2:17:01] she unlocks the lock
[2:17:03] unlocks her feet the chain her fetus on
[2:17:07] her feet
[2:17:07] and they walk outside from the office
[2:17:10] and the woman says sir
[2:17:14] rather he spoke first and he said lady
[2:17:17] you are free
[2:17:19] go
[2:17:22] false on her knees instantly
[2:17:25] she grabs his dirty muddy workers boots
[2:17:30] and starts crying
[2:17:32] and says sir
[2:17:34] you bored me
[2:17:36] you liberated me
[2:17:39] and now you gave me the freedom and now
[2:17:41] I'm free

[2:17:52] gold but these Precious Blood friends
