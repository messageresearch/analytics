[22:45] there's anything holding us back if
[22:47] there's anything Lord that's hindering
[22:49] our lives Lord father I pray that your
[22:52] love would come and remove all fear and
[22:55] Lord bring a real change tonight father
[22:58] Lord I pray that you would just come
[23:00] Lord and visit us in a special way Lord
[23:03] that Lord father there's no no man can
[23:07] do what you can do Lord and we're
[23:09] depending on the Living God to move
[23:11] tonight and in a mighty way Lord that's
[23:14] our expectation tonight Lord whether
[23:17] we're here in this room or out on the
[23:19] stream Lord Jesus father we've all got
[23:21] needs father Lord we all face a real
[23:25] enemy that comes to do real trouble in
[23:27] our lives but we serve a living God
[23:29] who's greater than that enemy and
[23:31] greater is he that is in me than he that
[23:33] is in the world and so tonight Lord
[23:35] Jesus let that greatness be expressed
[23:38] Lord go beyond all ability of man
[23:41] because we don't have any who we're
[23:43] looking to you out all sufficient living
[23:45] loving sacrifice our Jesus the one that
[23:48] paid it all for us
[23:50] and the one that's got the the greatest
[23:52] bank balance the spiritual bank balance
[23:54] to back up your word to back up all your
[23:57] promises for they're all yea and they're
[23:59] all amen and tonight Lord Jesus I
[24:02] depending on you and I'm asking Lord
[24:04] that you would take complete control of
[24:07] preacher and hearer
[24:09] whether in this room or on the online
[24:11] Lord we're just asking now that you
[24:14] bless the service have your way to night
[24:16] Lord take control of every spirit
[24:18] oh God
[24:19] just depending on you now father
[24:22] in Jesus Christ's name
[24:24] amen
[24:26] hallelujah
[24:27] amen who's who's ready to have church
[24:31] amen hallelujah hallelujah you know I
[24:34] just get so caught up I forget what I'm
[24:36] doing and oh man what's next Hallelujah
[24:39] the Lord knows amen
[24:41] Hallelujah um thank you musicians amen
[24:44] hallelujah you can oh I can drive it
[24:47] here that's right he's getting used to
[24:48] this it's all here now we don't have any
[24:50] pointers anymore amen if you can turn in
[24:53] your Bibles tonight to 1 John 4 17.
[24:57] and 18 and
[24:59] oh my amen I believe you know I'm just
[25:02] depending on him tonight because without
[25:04] him you know this is just another sermon
[25:08] or and it and it could without him it's
[25:10] just subject matter that you've heard
[25:12] before right we've heard these things
[25:13] we've read these scriptures we've heard
[25:16] this preached before and Ben definitely
[25:18] has because I preached it in Africa so
[25:20] but it will be different so you know but
[25:24] with with this depend on the Lord you
[25:26] know we're depending on him and so
[25:28] tonight if you've just come to hear
[25:30] someone speak then that's all you'll get
[25:32] but if you've come expecting him to come
[25:35] and do something in your life
[25:37] Hallelujah then I believe that you will
[25:39] walk out of the service change
[25:41] and maybe you don't want God to do
[25:43] anything in your life but I believe that
[25:44] God is greater than that and he can help
[25:46] you and he can change your situation and
[25:49] take that fear off your life that's
[25:51] holding you back
[25:52] because fear holds us back it stops us
[25:55] from doing things amen it restricts us
[25:58] oh my it makes us be controlled by other
[26:01] people's opinions or what we think other
[26:02] people think that they might not even be
[26:04] thinking
[26:05] I want to speak tonight on the subject
[26:07] from fearfulness to the miraculous
[26:11] and I believe the Lord is here tonight
[26:12] to turn the tables of fear Hey Brother
[26:15] Marion good to see you bro hallelujah
[26:18] amen I'm so glad brother Marion's back
[26:20] hallelujah amen let's read sorry I'll
[26:23] keep you standing hearing us our love
[26:25] made perfect
[26:27] that we may have boldness in the day of
[26:29] judgment because as he is so are we in
[26:35] this world
[26:36] that's a definite reality for you it's
[26:39] your inheritance as he is so are you
[26:42] in 18 there is no fear in love
[26:46] amen
[26:47] but perfect love casts out fear I'm so
[26:51] glad that love is powerful
[26:53] and it's got the power to cast out fear
[26:55] because fear is torment and he that
[26:58] feareth is not made perfect in love
[27:01] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[27:02] reading of his word you may be seated
[27:04] Hallelujah
[27:07] do I just click that there we go the
[27:10] prophet says this and
[27:12] a personal experience with God he says
[27:15] this loving him oh we say we have faith
[27:18] we have love but if we had love we'd
[27:21] have faith
[27:23] for betters perfect love casts out all
[27:26] fair and when fear is gone
[27:29] faith is perfect
[27:32] let me read that again and when fear is
[27:34] gone faith is perfect
[27:38] as me and Isaac also there's your
[27:40] problem right there John
[27:42] fear fear is a is one of the most
[27:46] prevalent emotional problems that the
[27:48] human race has
[27:55] 1 John 3 19 and I'm just going to lay a
[27:58] foundation then we'll see what the Lord
[27:59] does Amen 1 John 3 19 it says and hereby
[28:02] we know that we are of the truth and
[28:05] shall assure our hearts before him for
[28:07] if our heart condemn us
[28:10] God is greater than our heart and know
[28:12] of all things beloved if our heart
[28:15] condemn us not condemneth us not then we
[28:18] have confidence towards God
[28:21] and confidence towards God is a key
[28:23] element to you having faith to believe
[28:27] and to loving God because when you love
[28:28] somebody you have confidence in their
[28:30] word you'll have confidence in their
[28:32] integrity in their character in what
[28:35] they you will have confidence in how
[28:37] much God loves you and how he cares
[28:39] about you and what he's made you so that
[28:41] you can have faith in what you are and
[28:44] that really is the key to perfect faith
[28:46] but it starts with a real confidence in
[28:49] God a loving of God I want to read a
[28:51] quote here it's not in the slideshow but
[28:53] I just it just so impressed me just
[28:55] earlier I just want to read this
[28:57] so it's not on the screen so just
[28:59] forgive me for that but um yeah it says
[29:01] here love has no fear love casts out
[29:03] fair and I noticed in my meetings so
[29:06] much that when I come into the people
[29:09] one of the great things I find among
[29:11] them is fear
[29:13] and you know a prophet could see the
[29:15] fear could see it it can discern it and
[29:18] see what's restricting all these people
[29:19] and I can tell you everyone in this room
[29:22] has got struggles in their life that's
[29:25] either rooted or as a derivative of fear
[29:27] it's got something to do with fear it's
[29:29] afraid of something fear of rejection
[29:31] fear of failure fear of change fear of
[29:34] all these different things but let me
[29:35] tell you God gave me the subject tonight
[29:38] for you
[29:39] so that he can come and visit you and
[29:42] cast that fear out of your life and turn
[29:44] the table
[29:46] because what I just read before is two
[29:48] different types of fear there's a
[29:50] there's a a fear that's made you afraid
[29:53] and hold you back but there is actually
[29:55] a real fear that you should have and
[29:57] that is the fear of God an uncorrupted
[30:00] perfect or
[30:03] who said the word awesome our god is
[30:06] awesome he's awesome and he wants you to
[30:08] be in awe of him but what the devil does
[30:10] is he makes us scared of him
[30:13] and he makes us scared to react it makes
[30:15] us scared to even express ourselves and
[30:17] sometimes it gets so bad that you're
[30:19] even afraid to worship
[30:22] you're afraid to do something I even you
[30:25] know I preached about the devil a while
[30:27] a long time ago a few years ago and I
[30:28] had such a bad trial it was like weeks
[30:31] of just oh my and it was a series I
[30:34] never finished it you know and I think I
[30:36] must admit I was a bit afraid because of
[30:39] the the attacks that I got I thought man
[30:42] do I even bother you know I was ready to
[30:44] leave the ministry leave everything it
[30:47] was so bad
[30:49] and I remember after I preached that
[30:51] brother and poco's man you really
[30:52] exposed the devil tonight and I was like
[30:55] yeah but then for about seven weeks
[30:58] after that I went through one of the
[30:59] biggest Trials of my life and it's all
[31:01] in here
[31:02] and it's all because of fear and he just
[31:04] grips you down this fear and oh my yeah
[31:08] oh I'm gonna hold fire because I just
[31:11] want to get to something first okay I'm
[31:13] being a good boy and I'm laying a
[31:14] foundation
[31:16] Hallelujah
[31:17] amen
[31:19] oh you know and I pray Lord
[31:22] let this because fear even now right
[31:26] getting nervous being afraid you know it
[31:29] can happen it can happen in the pulpit
[31:30] and it can take us and derail as someone
[31:33] that's preaching
[31:34] by fear and I tell you one that is the
[31:36] fear of what people think
[31:38] or the fear of of of of of doing
[31:41] something wrong but I tell you what this
[31:43] is where the perfect balance is because
[31:45] you don't want to be overconfident
[31:46] either but you've got to have confidence
[31:47] in God
[31:49] and you've got to have such a love and
[31:51] confidence in him that you can totally
[31:53] rest and allow God and love this
[31:55] atmosphere to express what he wants
[31:58] without any fear of man
[32:00] but a true restoration of uncorrupted
[32:03] reverence towards God
[32:06] now
[32:08] fear the bad fear really started
[32:12] for us on the earth in Eden
[32:16] yeah
[32:17] man I tell you what it was hard to find
[32:19] a decent image
[32:20] right oh my I said you know fig leaves
[32:23] and Eden and things like that and I had
[32:26] to sort through a few things but we'll
[32:28] leave it there but from or so here we
[32:31] have an Eden and a perfect utopic
[32:33] condition and Adam and and his wife you
[32:36] know they were one with God and they
[32:38] fellowship with God and they were an
[32:39] aura of God and they feared God but it
[32:42] was a real fear it was a real or there's
[32:44] a real emotion a real fear a real
[32:46] reference
[32:48] but the thing is when they separated
[32:50] from God and Satan needed this to happen
[32:53] so that he could come and he could put a
[32:56] corrupted fear on the earth so that
[32:58] that's what would drive his whole
[32:59] civilization but you can see here how
[33:02] they're afraid of the one that can only
[33:04] one that can help them what is that and
[33:06] that's been inherent in man and is run
[33:08] from God and maybe you're running from
[33:10] God and maybe there's a fear in your
[33:12] life that's holding you back tonight but
[33:15] just remember God's come
[33:19] God's purpose tonight is to visit you
[33:22] is to visit your Pew to visit your mind
[33:25] to visit your heart
[33:26] and take those fears out of your life
[33:28] and everything that's restricting you
[33:31] he's the one that does it not me not no
[33:34] minister no one but Jesus
[33:36] he's the one that can do it
[33:39] this is the Lucifer's whole Vision was
[33:42] to create an Economy based on fear
[33:45] an economy that's driven by fear an
[33:47] economy a world that everyone's afraid
[33:50] of missing out
[33:52] and you know what that creates greed and
[33:54] greed is what drives the economy and
[33:57] people will they won't do it for free
[33:59] they will get paid to do it they'll want
[34:01] money they want gold they'll want you
[34:04] know what the whole driving force of
[34:06] this economy of the devil is gold
[34:10] and that is the pavement in heaven
[34:13] and so I just say praise the Lord we're
[34:15] going to walk on it amen that's why if
[34:18] that's the case and you're already there
[34:20] then why not you let it under your feet
[34:21] don't let money rule you
[34:24] let money be a tool
[34:26] and by faith conquer it
[34:30] amen hallelujah
[34:33] some common synonyms of fear I'm
[34:35] probably saying that wrong alarm alarm
[34:37] dread fright Panic Terror and
[34:40] trepidation while all these words mean a
[34:43] painful agitation in the presence or
[34:45] anticipation and that's the big one
[34:48] because yes the fear is good that you
[34:50] need that man if you're you know
[34:52] sometimes you've got to run sometimes
[34:54] you've got to fight
[34:56] sometimes you have to especially when
[34:58] that enemy tows the line with you
[35:00] right you've got to stand
[35:03] Hallelujah but don't fear Him
[35:05] don't be afraid of him but I tell you
[35:07] what the trouble that we have and the
[35:09] human race has is the anticipation
[35:11] Crossing Bridges before you come to them
[35:13] worried about all the possible outcomes
[35:16] it could be what does that do it breaks
[35:19] your bond
[35:20] to Jesus Christ it breaks the bond that
[35:24] you have to Jesus Christ because you're
[35:25] afraid of what others think or you're
[35:28] afraid that you're going to miss out on
[35:29] something
[35:31] you're in or you're afraid of what
[35:33] possibly could happen and yet and there
[35:35] is an outcome and God has said you know
[35:36] I've I I would above all things that you
[35:39] prosper and be in health and if you seek
[35:42] me first all these things will be added
[35:43] to you you'd have to worry about all
[35:45] these natural things in life you don't
[35:46] have to worry about the economy you
[35:48] don't have to worry about anything the
[35:49] moment you worry it breaks the
[35:52] connection of faith
[35:53] it actually cripples Faith fear cripples
[35:57] faith
[35:58] and that's the very thing that crippled
[36:00] the faith of the Israelites when they
[36:01] came out of Egypt who knows the story
[36:04] they came out of Egypt they saw Great
[36:06] Mighty wonders and they saw in the hand
[36:08] of God through Moses and still they've
[36:12] disbelieved still they feared and still
[36:15] they were severed from the promises of
[36:17] God because
[36:18] of fear they were afraid of the enemy
[36:21] and in that fear which is an atmosphere
[36:25] excuse the pun but in that fair as an
[36:28] atmosphere which breaks the faith when
[36:30] they've broken the faith and they've
[36:32] stopped believing then all the Devils
[36:33] just coming in and then the devil has a
[36:36] field day in their mind and what does he
[36:38] do he goes back into their subconscious
[36:40] four or five generations of slavery and
[36:43] starts to stir up the slave mentality
[36:45] within them
[36:47] oh man and uses that old mentality
[36:52] and they Wonder whistle the Miracles
[36:54] where's the supernatural I tell you what
[36:56] it gets severed by fear
[36:59] and tonight I believe the Lord if
[37:00] there's any fear in your life you don't
[37:03] have to leave the service with it
[37:05] Hallelujah just ask God
[37:08] I don't know what fear you have in your
[37:10] life unless I'm really close with you
[37:12] and you've you've had confidence to tell
[37:14] me about yourself but God does and maybe
[37:18] and I shouldn't say maybe but certainly
[37:21] God knows fears in your life that you
[37:23] might not even be aware of that are
[37:25] restricting you and you might think it's
[37:27] something else but really it's rooted in
[37:29] fear but perfect love is here Jesus
[37:31] Christ is here tonight to take fear
[37:34] so that you're not afraid to worship so
[37:36] that you're not afraid to express Who
[37:38] You Are
[37:39] oh my you know the devil over the ages
[37:43] has always used fear to control the
[37:45] races on mass even with the covid-19
[37:48] vaccine all those things he and the and
[37:50] the pandemic that came fear just gripped
[37:53] the whole world within 24 hours the
[37:55] world was under control of the devil
[37:57] through what
[37:59] fear
[38:00] it wasn't a pandemic of germs and colds
[38:03] and flus it was a pandemic of fear and
[38:05] it was the fear that people are still
[38:07] out there now and there's no covert and
[38:08] they've still got masks on
[38:10] because they're fearful
[38:11] and they develop fear because they have
[38:13] a mask on and then all of a sudden
[38:16] they're hiding behind a mask and now
[38:17] they're scared to take it off because
[38:19] they've and I me and Isaac went to China
[38:21] and they lived behind masks and we asked
[38:24] the girl that translated for us and she
[38:25] was like yeah now people just are so
[38:28] scared to show who they are people have
[38:30] got behind this mask and they live
[38:31] behind it and they get plastic surgeries
[38:33] and everything they're so insecure
[38:35] insecurity
[38:38] but perfect love is here tonight to take
[38:40] your insecurities
[38:42] especially school children
[38:44] you know oh my goodness the social media
[38:47] and all of the everything
[38:49] I mean we've we struggle with it with
[38:51] movies all that stuff in our time and
[38:53] now it's probably 10 times worse but the
[38:55] image of perfection that the devil waves
[38:57] in front of the people the made-up woman
[38:59] the made-up boys all of those things
[39:00] that look so good and yet they're not
[39:03] even that good it's all just Photoshop
[39:05] you know it's all just some fancy thing
[39:08] and then you behold that and what does
[39:10] it do it makes you insecure
[39:12] and that's a fear on your life that
[39:14] stops you from expressing Who You Are
[39:17] and you may not even realize it you may
[39:19] even come to church and have a good time
[39:20] but you've but there's more of Christ to
[39:23] be expressed in your life so I just pray
[39:25] and I want you to pray this Lord if
[39:27] there's anything holding me back
[39:29] show me tonight
[39:31] just show me tonight
[39:34] that's what I depended on the law for
[39:36] I'm just going to share a few scriptures
[39:38] and things
[39:39] but I'm depending on him
[39:42] but listen to that the anticipation of
[39:44] danger fear is the most general term and
[39:47] implies anxiety and usually loss of
[39:50] Courage
[39:51] and what did Israel lose their courage
[39:53] but what did God say to Joshua when he
[39:55] went into claim an air inheritance be
[39:58] courageous
[39:59] be very courageous and I want to just uh
[40:03] commission it's not the right word but
[40:05] I'll just use a you all and myself be
[40:08] very courageous
[40:09] because there is the Last Frontier of
[40:12] the battle and and of our inheritance to
[40:14] claim and it's going to take courage and
[40:16] it's going to take confidence in him
[40:18] it's going to take perfect love and an
[40:21] atmosphere where there's no fear in your
[40:24] life in the church and so when you come
[40:26] to church you know the perfect love
[40:28] comes and that's what we pray for amen
[40:30] it's the greatest thing the prophet says
[40:32] lay aside everything yeah yeah until you
[40:34] have perfect love what is it's the Holy
[40:37] Spirit
[40:38] you see it the Holy Spirit starts in
[40:40] your life as a little white button
[40:41] Prophet Sid
[40:43] start small and you feed it on the word
[40:45] and he feeds on the word what does he do
[40:47] he begins like that little rock you know
[40:49] in Daniel's dream Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[40:51] how that Little Rock was came off the
[40:53] mountain and it smote the image of
[40:55] Babylon and it blew that image up
[40:58] that Little Rock
[41:00] that's that's the Gentile dispensation
[41:02] finish right we all know that is there
[41:04] anyone that doesn't know that right the
[41:06] whole Gentile Justin station was
[41:08] prophesied in that dream and and the The
[41:10] Little Rock which is Christ that came
[41:12] from the mountain cut without hands
[41:14] smote the very feet of that image and
[41:16] blew it all up
[41:18] do you think happens when the Holy Ghost
[41:19] comes into your heart
[41:21] it blows up the image of Babylon out of
[41:24] your life
[41:25] no more you know you you won't struggle
[41:27] with those things anymore
[41:29] it's like a total Deliverance it's a
[41:32] total change of character a change of
[41:34] heart but what does it do he comes in
[41:36] and what does it say in that dream it
[41:38] says that he comes in and he starts to
[41:40] fill the whole Earth
[41:42] what is he doing as the prophet says he
[41:44] says it starts off as a little white
[41:46] button of light and begins to grow in
[41:48] your life grow and your life grow was it
[41:50] doing casting out all the fear all the
[41:52] anxiety or the trepidation or the loss
[41:55] of Courage all of the all of the
[41:57] distractions and the lusts and the
[41:59] envies in them and all the
[42:00] competitiveness
[42:03] you know that insecurity where you've
[42:06] got something to prove all the time
[42:08] we've got nothing to prove
[42:10] he proves he's the one that proves his
[42:13] own word in our life not me not you him
[42:16] Hallelujah
[42:18] amen
[42:20] what does he do he comes into your heart
[42:21] to fill your whole earth to fill
[42:23] everything in your life so that he's
[42:25] taken over Amen to give you courage
[42:30] oh my
[42:36] has he not ever heard the word petrified
[42:37] before
[42:38] I've uh you know like oh man he's
[42:41] petrified or
[42:43] petrified with fear you know fear can
[42:45] get such a grip on you
[42:50] fear can grip your whole body and spirit
[42:55] until you are completely disarmed
[42:58] until you cannot function until you on
[43:02] my computer if I really stuff it up it
[43:04] goes into safe mode is it unheard of
[43:06] safe mode before
[43:08] and it's like blue screen of death and
[43:10] you can you may get it back
[43:13] oh my how many people get stuck in safe
[43:16] mode spiritual safe mode come out of
[43:20] safe mode my son my daughter Hallelujah
[43:23] I believe the spirit is calling us out
[43:25] of safe mode calling us out take the
[43:28] safety off
[43:29] and just let God Express himself through
[43:32] you don't fear the enemy the enemies
[43:34] nothing greater as he was in you than he
[43:36] who is in the world
[43:37] greater
[43:39] Hallelujah the Lord is intent through
[43:42] the scripture from Genesis to Revelation
[43:44] fear not my bride fear not little flock
[43:48] for it is your father's Good Will to
[43:50] give you the kingdom Hallelujah Esther
[43:53] she was afraid why did she have to be
[43:55] afraid for it was her inheritance all
[43:59] she needed to do was stand before the
[44:01] king in Courage
[44:05] and he extended the scepter and she
[44:07] received unto half the kingdom
[44:11] but we get this this is what happens in
[44:13] life petrification that you know like um
[44:17] it brings an emotional disconnection
[44:19] through
[44:20] Pro prolonged fear and anxiety
[44:25] you know emotional disconnection to
[44:28] petrify you
[44:29] you become imprisoned to fear you become
[44:32] imprisoned to depression because you're
[44:35] constantly anxious about stuff and
[44:36] apprehensive about things and Crossing
[44:38] Bridges before they come and your body
[44:39] says come on
[44:41] come on
[44:43] that's enough
[44:44] I say this to my children all the time
[44:46] because sometimes I have to tell them
[44:47] off well probably all the time but you
[44:50] know children children but you're always
[44:51] telling people telling them off you know
[44:52] because they're and you've got to in
[44:54] love and
[44:56] and you know sometimes it's hard
[44:59] and I said you know every time I say
[45:01] something like this
[45:02] I always say look it's not hopeless yeah
[45:05] yeah because what I'm showing you right
[45:07] now what is being revealed in this
[45:09] conversation there is a right in this
[45:12] moment is a way out
[45:13] right in this moment is the opportunity
[45:15] for change for a real experience with
[45:18] God
[45:19] and the purpose of the law the purpose
[45:21] of of the of the word is to come and
[45:24] show us the mirror image of ourself
[45:26] right the marriage of Christ then you
[45:28] see it and when you see something in
[45:29] your life that's not meant to be there
[45:31] then you say oh God help me Lord I don't
[45:34] want that in my life anymore I don't
[45:36] want fear in my life I don't want
[45:37] limitation in my life I don't want
[45:39] anxiety in my life I don't want to cross
[45:41] Bridges before I come I don't want to
[45:42] have an anticipation of what could go
[45:44] wrong
[45:46] because what does that do it cripples
[45:47] your face
[45:48] and you knew live emotionally
[45:51] disconnected
[45:53] from God and from people
[45:55] your body says no I'm sick of feeling
[45:58] like this fear creates a negative
[45:59] chemicals in your body bloodstream and
[46:01] your body doesn't want that anymore so
[46:03] what does it do it says turn it off
[46:05] depression then you become disconnected
[46:08] you begin to pull back and pull away it
[46:09] gets all too much but there's an answer
[46:11] tonight there's an answer that's flowing
[46:14] in the House of David the blood that
[46:17] flows from Emmanuel's veins it is
[46:19] speaking Freedom tonight it's speaking
[46:21] better things than Abel's blood that's
[46:23] in Revenge Revenge but this one says
[46:26] Mercy Grace Hallelujah and there's a
[46:29] people tonight that can worship and say
[46:31] Grace Grace unto it because there's
[46:34] Capstone has come and what is he to do
[46:37] to get rid of those things he came in
[46:40] many times the angel of the Lord
[46:42] we'll get to it soon and he visited the
[46:45] ages and he visited different times when
[46:47] they were all in a big mess
[46:50] who comes on the scene the angel of the
[46:53] Lord the angel of the Lord why because
[46:56] he wants to take fear out of their lives
[46:59] because they're afraid of the enemy
[47:01] they're afraid of missing out
[47:03] you know they get afraid of missing out
[47:04] God delivers them then a generation goes
[47:07] by then they get afraid of missing out
[47:09] what the world's got
[47:11] they get fomo who's got who's suffered
[47:13] with fomo before
[47:15] oh my
[47:17] that's a very bad thing you know like
[47:19] that can draw you into the world
[47:21] you think oh I would like to try that
[47:23] and that's what Israel did they like to
[47:25] try it and then the spirit of it comes
[47:27] upon them and then they get mowed down
[47:29] and then they scared of the enemy
[47:31] because they've lost faith
[47:34] but then who comes
[47:37] this one here
[47:39] I don't know if I really had it properly
[47:41] but if this is a sermon in itself is
[47:43] always in fight or flight mode
[47:45] and now when you're always in fight or
[47:47] flight mode who knows what that is
[47:50] does anyone not know what fight or
[47:52] flight mode is
[47:53] children you can be honest fight or
[47:56] flight mode is where it's activated it's
[47:58] a natural instinct than the human being
[48:00] that when something dangerous is
[48:03] happening or something that's causing
[48:06] you to either fight that thing or run
[48:08] yeah
[48:10] did you know that human beings often
[48:12] live in that condition
[48:14] they're constantly living in anxiety and
[48:16] fear and and torment
[48:18] and they haven't really connected to
[48:20] perfect love
[48:22] even Christians people that sit in this
[48:24] church can sit and live in that fight or
[48:26] flight mode
[48:28] because they're as worried about stuff
[48:29] and worried about money and worried
[48:31] about what this one says children
[48:32] worried about what my schoolmates would
[48:34] think if I was like this worried about
[48:36] what my boss would think if I did this
[48:38] or said that let's not be worried
[48:41] because I'm worry how can God lead you
[48:44] because you see these when you're in
[48:46] vital flight mode it actually it's in
[48:48] Galatians 5 it talks about how the flesh
[48:50] comes out
[48:51] and fear and all these things in the
[48:54] flesh The Works of the flesh begins to
[48:55] come out because you can't be led by the
[48:57] spirit
[48:57] because perfect love casts out fear but
[49:00] when you've got fear and you're in vital
[49:02] flight mode how can the spirit the dove
[49:04] come down and lead you and put you in an
[49:06] atmosphere where you can have faith and
[49:08] win the fruit of the spirits
[49:10] the fruit of the spirit you should bear
[49:12] Above All Things
[49:14] you know that Above All Things
[49:16] but it's that easy as a Believer
[49:19] Spirit-filled to get thrown out of
[49:22] condition that's State it's a state of
[49:25] mind of of love
[49:27] and we can get distracted and we can get
[49:28] busy and we can get apprehensive we can
[49:31] worry about our families and worry about
[49:32] this and that and everything else and
[49:34] stay in a fight or flight mode and what
[49:36] happens you start getting carnal then
[49:39] fleshly starts to manifest in your life
[49:41] but God is saying walk in the spirit
[49:44] favorite walk in the spirit shall not do
[49:46] the lust of the flesh because the spirit
[49:50] the the flesh lusts against the spirit
[49:53] it's against the spirit but the spirit
[49:55] is also against the flesh
[49:57] which one are you going to yield to
[49:59] tonight which one are you going to allow
[50:02] to lead you tonight because you don't
[50:04] have to stay in fight or flight mode
[50:05] someone on that camera you don't have to
[50:07] stay in fight or flight mode you can
[50:09] come out of it tonight and have perfect
[50:11] peace and perfect love and the love the
[50:15] spirit of God can come into your life
[50:17] and truly bring you into rest
[50:19] and Lead You
[50:22] Hallelujah
[50:25] this come out of final flight mode some
[50:27] potential triggers of of fear now I just
[50:31] put these up here and there's a lot of
[50:33] them and there's lots more but
[50:35] the the whole purpose of this is just to
[50:39] I've asked the Lord if there's anything
[50:42] in our life that is triggered
[50:44] that we can deal with it
[50:45] by he can deal with it tonight that he
[50:48] can just come right now where you're at
[50:49] you'd have to wait till the end of the
[50:51] service it can happen as the word Goes
[50:53] Forth
[50:54] amen Darkness
[50:57] spiders
[50:59] you know snakes spiders lizards mice
[51:04] Heights
[51:05] flying social interaction
[51:08] man's opinion that's a big one
[51:11] have I told you about what happened you
[51:14] know we were given a dream
[51:16] well many years ago now probably five
[51:18] odd years ago
[51:20] um
[51:21] of uh you know I we were driving and I
[51:25] was I was in my car and Brahman was next
[51:27] to me
[51:28] and I was driving but my hands were off
[51:31] the steering wheel
[51:33] I wasn't on the steering wheel
[51:35] and it was driving and bromham was like
[51:38] that's like a room it's been driven from
[51:41] a remote
[51:42] and and often times in a spiritual dream
[51:46] akara represents Ministry and the Lord
[51:49] was and there was a whole bunch of other
[51:51] stuff that happened after that but this
[51:53] one was very clear the interpretation
[51:54] came very clear that that you you cannot
[51:57] let other people's opinion drive your
[51:59] life
[52:00] and in this particular instance Drive
[52:01] the ministry to drive how I preach what
[52:04] I do what I say you cannot because when
[52:08] you take your hands off the steering
[52:09] wheel and you let other people's ideas
[52:11] or what you think they think drive it
[52:13] who's leading
[52:15] and that's same for your life that's the
[52:17] same whether you're at school or you're
[52:18] at job or you're traveling the world and
[52:20] preaching that's the same thing let God
[52:23] lead you have no fear of what people
[52:25] think have no fear of man's opinion
[52:27] rejection man what a big one fear of
[52:30] rejection
[52:31] just remember you're accepted can I tell
[52:34] you that tonight
[52:36] you are accepted in the Beloved
[52:39] you don't have to earn it actually you
[52:41] can't earn it don't even try you're
[52:43] given it God loves you so much all the
[52:46] people of God love you so much you're
[52:49] part of the family of God
[52:51] you know they talk about prestigious
[52:53] families and how good it would be to be
[52:55] born into such a family or a powerful
[52:57] family in that you're actually being
[52:59] born into the most powerful family you
[53:01] are the most powerful people on the
[53:03] Earth
[53:04] I'm sure you've been told that many
[53:06] times but you're part of the greatest
[53:07] family and you can't join it you're
[53:10] going to be born into it through the new
[53:12] birth
[53:13] repent turn from your wicked ways and be
[53:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[53:18] the remission of sins and you shall you
[53:23] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[53:27] for This Promise is unto you until you
[53:29] your children and to all that are far
[53:31] off
[53:33] we're far off
[53:35] and even as many as the Lord shall call
[53:37] amen is he still calling

[54:45] some
[54:46] fear of losing control fear of death
[54:48] fear of missing out we know that one
[54:51] change fear of change fear of failure
[54:53] and fear of losing face
[54:56] Pride
[54:58] can stop us these things can hinder us
[55:02] but as the past has been preaching

[55:11] limiting you you know what's holding you
[55:13] back

[1:03:49] you
[1:03:53] you can God and we want to see his
[1:03:55] miracles but the problem that they had
[1:03:58] in Israel
[1:04:00] the trouble that they had is all they
[1:04:03] could say was the testimonies of the
[1:04:05] past why because they feared why because
[1:04:08] they were fearful of the enemy and I
[1:04:10] want you tonight to realize you don't
[1:04:12] have to be afraid
[1:04:14] you don't have to be afraid the devil
[1:04:16] wants you to be afraid because he knows

[1:04:42] and every now and again
[1:04:44] you're on the agenda
[1:04:48] now I'm going to speak what you should
[1:04:49] be
[1:04:50] and I believe that you are really
[1:04:53] when the when you come up on that bill
[1:04:56] and that you're up on their projector
[1:04:58] screen
[1:05:03] uh
[1:05:04] and they start saying right
[1:05:06] and they gather all the devils and and
[1:05:09] then they're like and then your name
[1:05:11] comes up and all of a sudden the Devils
[1:05:12] start going to the back
[1:05:15] no way
[1:05:17] and they're like all right call them the
[1:05:19] higher Powers then call them the the
[1:05:21] national Spirits then so the national
[1:05:23] spirits come in and they say your name
[1:05:25] oh no no no
[1:05:27] no no no no no
[1:05:30] and now the devil's real angry now
[1:05:32] Lucifer comes and then when he sees your
[1:05:34] name he says no no take them away we
[1:05:39] will not we can't do anything to her we
[1:05:42] can't do anything to him because they
[1:05:44] have no fear
[1:05:45] oh they don't speak our language they
[1:05:48] speak a language of Heaven they speak a
[1:05:51] language of love they receive Jesus
[1:05:55] Hallelujah
[1:05:57] that's right he has no power over you
[1:06:02] I want you to really express yourself in
[1:06:06] his grace and his presence so that you
[1:06:08] don't have to tell your children or just
[1:06:11] tell of some past God but you've got to
[1:06:14] now God
[1:06:16] Gideon had real enemies they really came
[1:06:19] and they really destroyed his crops
[1:06:21] and they were hungry and they were weak
[1:06:25] but God rich and mercy
[1:06:28] he's not gonna leave them like that
[1:06:32] Glory
[1:06:34] who believes that
[1:06:37] Oh Glory
[1:06:38] removing fear
[1:06:40] through Angelic visitation
[1:06:42] this is really the Crux of the slot
[1:06:46] it's not a historical thing yeah yeah
[1:06:48] you see we're in the appearing of the
[1:06:50] Lord we're in the age where the mighty
[1:06:52] Angel himself has descended into your
[1:06:55] life he didn't just Ascend into the age
[1:06:57] in 63. he descended into you you are
[1:07:00] part of the program
[1:07:03] news flash front page is it on the front
[1:07:05] page
[1:07:06] you are part of this there's no you know
[1:07:09] sometimes we just think oh it's the
[1:07:11] collective Gideon probably thought we're
[1:07:14] just stuffed as a nation because look at
[1:07:16] all the troubles and problems and if
[1:07:18] Gideon continued on that fearful kind of
[1:07:21] vein of thought he would never have had
[1:07:22] a Revival but you see God comes to you
[1:07:25] tonight because he wants the Revival to
[1:07:27] be in your life not just don't just
[1:07:29] think oh the church the church and all
[1:07:32] the collective yes we want them all we
[1:07:33] want everyone to be in Revival right but
[1:07:35] it starts with you
[1:07:37] it starts with you tonight with an
[1:07:39] invalid visitation into your life an
[1:07:42] Angelic visitation that is powerful
[1:07:44] enough to take Peter out of prison yeah
[1:07:46] amen it's powerful enough to remove the
[1:07:48] walls of Jericho so that Rahab can marry
[1:07:50] the captain
[1:07:51] how much more that real angel that would
[1:07:54] come down in this age
[1:07:56] Hallelujah to remove the walls of your
[1:07:58] own limitations and fears and holding
[1:08:00] you back in your old life how much more
[1:08:02] can that angel affect your life
[1:08:05] breaking slave mentality removing not
[1:08:10] just covering Allah but removing fight
[1:08:13] or flight mode
[1:08:16] when you totally realize it satisfied
[1:08:18] yeah
[1:08:19] not yours
[1:08:20] it's not yours when you're in vital
[1:08:23] flight mode what are you doing owning
[1:08:25] the fight to yourself right right and
[1:08:27] then you're getting in fear
[1:08:29] but when you can surrender the fight to
[1:08:32] Jesus surrender the fight to him yet
[1:08:35] we'll take you out of final flight mode
[1:08:37] and you will come into perfect love then
[1:08:39] surrender becomes easy
[1:08:42] surrender becomes pleasurable oh
[1:08:46] Hallelujah
[1:08:50] I love this and we sing this a lot
[1:08:53] this poor man cried and the Lord heard
[1:08:56] him
[1:08:57] Hallelujah and save them out of all
[1:08:59] everyone say all all his troubles and
[1:09:03] the angel of the Lord and came to round
[1:09:05] about them that fear Him
[1:09:07] so now that fear that you had for all
[1:09:10] those things and fear of man's opinion
[1:09:12] and fear of what couldn't come or could
[1:09:14] come and all the things take that Fear
[1:09:16] cast that into the darkness and now fear
[1:09:19] the lord
[1:09:20] now I have a reverence for him because
[1:09:22] there has to be a fear in your life
[1:09:24] there has to be something that you're
[1:09:25] fearing but a positive fear to the right
[1:09:28] one and if you have fear in the right
[1:09:30] one he will encampus around you what
[1:09:33] does that mean he stays there night and
[1:09:36] day in your dreams in your wait time at
[1:09:39] work at the dishes at church at church
[1:09:42] lunch oh my when you're doing a special
[1:09:44] and there's fear on you oh I can't say
[1:09:47] oh I might muck it up don't be afraid of
[1:09:50] mucking it up
[1:09:52] God will take over
[1:09:53] yeah if you get scared of it how can God
[1:09:56] come and take over your song well how
[1:09:58] can God come and take over that thing
[1:09:59] that you're doing you just have to this
[1:10:02] is where confidence comes out don't if
[1:10:04] you've got confidence in yourself you
[1:10:06] will be in fight or flight mode and
[1:10:08] you'll be sitting up here ready to fly
[1:10:10] ready to fly off because you're scared
[1:10:12] of people and congregations and whatever
[1:10:14] but if you can just say Lord I'm not
[1:10:17] coming in my ability
[1:10:18] I'm not coming in my my skill or how
[1:10:22] much I've practiced practice all you can
[1:10:24] but when you come up here you just let
[1:10:27] go of all of that and hold on to him and
[1:10:30] say Lord here I am now Minister through
[1:10:32] and Lord bring a life to the gospel
[1:10:35] bring a life to yourself through the
[1:10:37] song or through whatever that you're
[1:10:39] doing for the Lord because in that
[1:10:41] atmosphere where there is no fear and
[1:10:43] you've got confidence in humor
[1:10:45] all things are possible
[1:10:47] all things not just for you but for the
[1:10:49] people that listen it changes the whole
[1:10:52] atmosphere of the whole thing everything
[1:10:54] changes when he comes everything changes
[1:10:57] when he comes amen do you believe that
[1:10:59] tonight
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:04] who is the Angel of the Lord that came
[1:11:06] to Gideon
[1:11:08] does everyone know
[1:11:10] this here tells you who he is
[1:11:13] oh my
[1:11:15] and all their Affliction he was
[1:11:18] afflicted and the angel of his presence
[1:11:22] saved them
[1:11:24] Hallelujah can you just think about that
[1:11:28] all the things that they went through
[1:11:30] Israel
[1:11:31] and everything they did this Angel of
[1:11:33] the Lord the angel of his presence
[1:11:36] saved him
[1:11:38] and who in his excuse me in his love and
[1:11:42] his pity he redeemed them what did he do
[1:11:45] he brought them from a con a horrible
[1:11:47] State and brought them back to their
[1:11:49] original condition
[1:11:50] Hallelujah
[1:11:53] it doesn't redeem you just to lose you
[1:11:54] he redeems you to keep you
[1:11:57] Aaron's Rod when it stayed in God's
[1:11:59] presence it flourished do you think it
[1:12:02] just stopped flourishing I would venture
[1:12:04] to say that there was a nice identity
[1:12:06] Garden in that place oh man I've never
[1:12:08] thought of that but about three weeks
[1:12:10] ago or something the Lord just kind of
[1:12:12] said you know what what what could
[1:12:13] happen if you stayed in the presence of
[1:12:15] God you know like the the rod would just
[1:12:18] flourish
[1:12:19] maybe he the high priest alone that
[1:12:21] would sin would see identical conditions
[1:12:23] in there I don't know but just think in
[1:12:25] the presence of God and as love he
[1:12:27] redeemed them to bring you to something
[1:12:30] that you were originally them and he
[1:12:33] beared them and carried them all the
[1:12:35] days of old
[1:12:37] this is what presents mean the angel of
[1:12:39] his presence the angel of his person
[1:12:42] the angel of his face
[1:12:45] the angel of his countenance
[1:12:48] the angel of his favor
[1:12:50] this is the hour of favor of God the

[1:13:47] the tables of fear
[1:13:49] so that you no longer fear these things
[1:13:51] but the devil fears you so that when
[1:13:54] there's a conference in hell
[1:13:56] they all run
[1:13:58] because they know that when they come to
[1:14:00] you they don't return in one piece they
[1:14:04] return with a solid beating and not just
[1:14:07] them but all their brothers all their
[1:14:09] fellow demons get beatings too and then
[1:14:11] National Spirits get deep beatings too
[1:14:13] and the international spirits and
[1:14:15] everything just gets a big hiding
[1:14:16] because you know that you've got an
[1:14:18] atomic weapon room in your prayer life
[1:14:21] and you know that you can send Atomic
[1:14:23] missiles down the devil's chimney
[1:14:26] and it will hit him

[1:14:50] because of what he did and it's the hour
[1:14:53] of his favor there's a visitation of
[1:14:56] favor
[1:14:58] I wish I got the definition for that but
[1:15:01] we all know it's a very good word
[1:15:04] his love was expressed in this Angelic
[1:15:06] visitation in Exodus 23 verse 20. and it
[1:15:09] says how the angel would come and Lead
[1:15:12] Israel into the promised land and cause
[1:15:14] their enemies to crumble at their feet
[1:15:16] and they were just all they had to do
[1:15:17] was walk forward and start slashing the
[1:15:20] sword
[1:15:21] don't worry about where it goes you just
[1:15:22] walk this way and start swiping and you
[1:15:25] swipe this one and swipe that beer and
[1:15:26] swipe that jealousy and swipe that
[1:15:28] hatred and swipe that malice swipe that
[1:15:31] SWAT that lust Hallelujah
[1:15:34] swipe it it's all he asked this Angel
[1:15:37] says I'm giving you favor all you need
[1:15:39] to do is walk forward and start slashing
[1:15:41] the enemy have his taken your children
[1:15:43] slash him down just keep slashing don't
[1:15:46] give up just keep slashing because
[1:15:48] Israel if they keep slashing they would
[1:15:50] have the whole end until David and they
[1:15:53] had everything why because they keep
[1:15:55] slashing they just keep cutting the
[1:15:57] enemies down one time one man cut 800
[1:16:00] and it set his hand cleaved to the sword
[1:16:02] couldn't let it go oh God bring me to
[1:16:04] that place where I can't let your word
[1:16:06] go where your word is so precious to me
[1:16:09] and it's so personal to me that I can't
[1:16:11] let it go I'm apprehended of bed which
[1:16:14] apprehends me Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:16:18] the word of God and all he says is keep
[1:16:20] flashing it's the hour of your favor
[1:16:22] it's time it's time in the name of the
[1:16:25] Lord Joshua meets the captain causes
[1:16:28] Deliverance over Jericho Hallelujah
[1:16:31] Gooden Gideon takes Gideon and his
[1:16:34] family and the whole nation out of fear
[1:16:35] they were scared of the midianites
[1:16:38] Midian means brawling
[1:16:40] it means fighting and disunity brawling
[1:16:44] the brawling a fight
[1:16:47] they were fearing all these things Paul
[1:16:50] he says this angel came to me who's I am
[1:16:55] identifying this Angel as Jesus Christ
[1:17:00] the Lord says in Exodus 23 that my name
[1:17:02] is in him who knows that says don't
[1:17:06] offend him my name's on him
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:09] and then obviously now
[1:17:11] in our day Revelation chapter 10.
[1:17:14] but what does he say
[1:17:15] to every single one
[1:17:17] what is his message what is the Crux of
[1:17:20] it right
[1:17:23] Lord
[1:17:26] let's have the musicians
[1:17:31] let's play this on fear you tried to
[1:17:33] have your way but not today
[1:17:35] amen not today
[1:17:39] his message
[1:17:41] fear not comes walking on the stormy
[1:17:44] seas of your life
[1:17:46] he says Be not Afraid it's me visiting
[1:17:48] you
[1:17:49] the real living God I've come to deliver
[1:17:52] you from a real enemy who's got no power
[1:17:54] but he is very real and he'll try
[1:17:56] everything he can and he'll try and
[1:17:58] bring you down and disable you but
[1:18:01] condemnation will not disable you
[1:18:03] because God's love he judges you
[1:18:06] righteous
[1:18:07] oh my imagine if we were if condemnation
[1:18:10] could disable us imagine if we had to
[1:18:13] live in condemnation
[1:18:14] how miserable that would be but God says
[1:18:17] fear not he visits us and says fear not
[1:18:20] he says fear not All Through the Ages is
[1:18:23] that right
[1:18:24] has he said fair not to you
[1:18:26] stop fearing these things
[1:18:29] it doesn't matter what people think of
[1:18:30] you
[1:18:31] so that will pass that'll be forgotten
[1:18:34] soon
[1:18:34] but what about the one that can help you
[1:18:37] tonight
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:39] Hallelujah
[1:18:41] all right I've just got a couple more
[1:18:43] things to read
[1:18:48] while that music's playing I just wanted
[1:18:49] to share a couple of
[1:18:53] I shared one already
[1:18:57] you know I was when we first started all
[1:18:59] these businesses and things years ago
[1:19:02] you know Isaac and myself we work so
[1:19:04] hard and everything just was going wrong
[1:19:06] and the more wrong it went the harder we
[1:19:09] had to work and it was just getting
[1:19:10] really hard
[1:19:12] and I was working from three I was
[1:19:15] working from Seven a.m to 3 A.M Some
[1:19:18] Nights
[1:19:18] and never getting really anything truly
[1:19:21] done
[1:19:24] and I got so out of catering I was
[1:19:27] fearing failure I was just afraid that I
[1:19:29] was going to fail I was afraid that the
[1:19:31] businesses were going to fall I'd gotten
[1:19:33] into I was in fight or flight mode and
[1:19:35] sometimes in our work in our natural
[1:19:37] life we get into that mode and we think
[1:19:40] we can do it and if you're listening on
[1:19:42] there you think you can do it you're
[1:19:44] wrong you cannot rescue your businesses
[1:19:47] you cannot achieve anything if God is
[1:19:49] calling you
[1:19:51] because you see he's got a powerful
[1:19:54] powerful promise if you seek me first if
[1:19:57] you put me first you will progress in
[1:19:58] the greatest manner and all these things
[1:20:01] that shall be added to you
[1:20:02] what is calling you to is fellowship in
[1:20:05] your bed chamber Fellowship in your
[1:20:07] secret place
[1:20:08] he wants you to meditate on his word and
[1:20:10] meditate on him in the Night Watch
[1:20:13] don't watch YouTube get off that habit
[1:20:15] there's a better there's a better
[1:20:17] greater form of joy and he and he
[1:20:20] actually promises if you do that he's
[1:20:21] going to bring marrow to your bones and
[1:20:23] prosper you all your natural things you
[1:20:25] won't need to worry about that he
[1:20:27] doesn't want us to fear natural things
[1:20:28] he doesn't want us to fear what's
[1:20:30] happening to the families he doesn't
[1:20:31] want us to fear the unknown or the
[1:20:33] future he just says trust me have
[1:20:35] confidence I've got this and that's what
[1:20:39] happened to me I went down to the river
[1:20:40] and I prayed and I said Lord what's
[1:20:42] happening and he said putting God first
[1:20:43] is the greatest progress and I was got
[1:20:46] so carnal and I sat on my bed one night
[1:20:48] because it did take a while for me to my
[1:20:51] thick-headed way to change and I still
[1:20:54] carried on for a bit and then I really
[1:20:55] my whole house got out of cater my
[1:20:58] children were going wild
[1:20:59] real wild and man Roman was having
[1:21:03] nightmares all the time and my house was
[1:21:05] out of cater and you know what I would
[1:21:07] lay on my bed one night and I was about
[1:21:09] to watch a cooking show because I was so
[1:21:10] desperately needing to learn all the
[1:21:12] stuff so that I could do cooking shows
[1:21:13] to make money and all these things while
[1:21:15] fearful oh God help us to not be like
[1:21:19] that help us to trust your lord and I I
[1:21:22] I I I laid on my bed and Bronwyn had
[1:21:25] been asleep for hours and she rolled
[1:21:27] over
[1:21:28] straight voice and said the Lord has
[1:21:29] been very gracious to you and then roll
[1:21:32] back over went back straight to sleep
[1:21:33] and I thought Whoa man
[1:21:35] well there goes my cooking show
[1:21:38] and then I felt like I should read the
[1:21:40] Bible and I felt like I was in a
[1:21:42] crossroad right there and if I took this
[1:21:45] if I took the Lord's way right now
[1:21:48] that it was going to be good for me and
[1:21:50] my family but if I didn't it was going
[1:21:52] to be a bad time for me
[1:21:54] and I was going to have to go through
[1:21:56] what Israel went through maybe or
[1:21:57] something like that where they just
[1:21:59] didn't go God's way and you know what
[1:22:03] I just opened my Bible and something
[1:22:04] said to me Psalm 39 and I read Psalm 39
[1:22:07] and it was really really good but real
[1:22:09] bad for me it was telling me everything
[1:22:11] that I needed to do and what I was and
[1:22:13] where I was at you know the word can
[1:22:15] tell you all that's in your life
[1:22:17] the word if you really trust them and
[1:22:19] look up to his word not down on it not
[1:22:21] cross at it look up to it and faith and
[1:22:24] say Lord speak to me he will prophesy in
[1:22:26] your life and he will tell you where
[1:22:27] you've gone come from where you're at
[1:22:30] and where you're going and how to get
[1:22:31] there this is the word of God Saints
[1:22:34] children it'll work this has got a Bible
[1:22:36] in it the word of God Amen I need a
[1:22:39] paper Bible and anyway I read this thing
[1:22:41] and I said Lord I'm going to read it
[1:22:42] again and if it really means this I'm
[1:22:44] really done and I read it again and I
[1:22:46] was done I've done done done and I
[1:22:48] thought Lord I'm going to read it in the
[1:22:49] Greek now or the Hebrew and if it says
[1:22:51] this I'm really done I felt like Gideon
[1:22:53] with the fleeces and then I really read
[1:22:55] that and I was done I was out down and
[1:22:58] out the Lord was sitting on my bed the
[1:23:00] angel of his presence the angel of his
[1:23:02] favor came to my bedroom that night and
[1:23:05] he changed me from Darkness into light
[1:23:07] and the next day I confessed all my
[1:23:10] troubles to Bronwyn I was holding back I
[1:23:12] was as hot as all internalized don't
[1:23:15] internalize it trust your spouse trust
[1:23:18] your pastor trust your friends and if
[1:23:20] you don't that's fair and God's come
