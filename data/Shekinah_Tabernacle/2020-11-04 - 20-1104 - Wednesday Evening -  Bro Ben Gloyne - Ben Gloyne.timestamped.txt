[22:55] go to first samuel
[22:57] um amen i trust you're all
[23:01] ready for a evening of prayer
[23:04] can you please turn me down a bit here
[23:06] um
[23:10] i'm gonna go to first samuel and
[23:13] first samuel 16.
[23:22] and we're going to read verses 1 then
[23:24] we're going to drop down and read verses
[23:26] 11 213. so first samuel 16 and verse 1
[23:32] and and samuel said unto saul
[23:37] the lord sent me to anoint thee
[23:41] to be psalm in 15 16.
[23:44] and the lord said unto samuel how long
[23:46] will thou mourn for saul
[23:47] saying i have rejected him from reigning
[23:50] over israel
[23:51] fill thy horn with oil and go i'll
[23:54] send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for
[23:57] i have provided me
[23:58] a king among his sons
[24:01] then we're going to drop down to verse
[24:03] 11 after
[24:05] you know after jesse's gone there and
[24:07] all the other sons have passed by and to
[24:09] everyone god says no
[24:10] no no and no doubt all of them thought
[24:12] i'm the one i'm the one i'm the one
[24:14] but god chooses the unlikely hello
[24:17] unlikely how are you
[24:18] how are you tonight amen and then we
[24:20] come to verse 11 and samuel said unto
[24:22] jesse
[24:23] i hear all thy children and he said
[24:25] there remaineth yet the youngest and
[24:27] behold he keepeth the sheep
[24:29] and samuel said unto jesse send and
[24:31] fetch him for we
[24:32] will not sit down until he come hither
[24:35] and he sent and brought him in now he
[24:38] was ready
[24:39] and with all of a beautiful countenance
[24:41] and goodly to look to
[24:42] and the lord said arise anoint him for
[24:44] this is he
[24:46] then samuel took the horn of oil and
[24:48] anointed him in the midst of his
[24:49] brethren
[24:50] and the spirit of the lord came upon
[24:51] david from that day forward
[24:53] so samuel rose up and went to rama
[24:57] amen let's just bow heads for a word of
[24:59] prayer as we have just read the word
[25:01] lord jesus we are so thankful we can
[25:04] read your word and
[25:05] i'm so thankful it's more than a story
[25:07] it's more than
[25:08] uh even a religious book lord but it's
[25:10] you in print form
[25:12] so father i just pray lord as we've
[25:13] gathered this night dear god no doubt
[25:15] many of us had very busy
[25:17] first few days of the week and lord we
[25:19] just want to pray you come and settle
[25:20] our spirits down now
[25:22] and lord we just want to come aside into
[25:24] your presence this night and i just pray
[25:26] lord you just
[25:27] bring us into a channel of prayer lord
[25:30] may you grant it lord may you be the one
[25:31] that prays through us lord may it not be
[25:33] our humanity or
[25:35] love it just might be you lord we want
[25:36] to step aside that you just take control
[25:39] lord pray you bless your word as we've
[25:41] read it i asked lord you'd take these
[25:43] few thoughts and just multiply it oh god
[25:45] may you grant it father for your glory
[25:47] we
[25:48] thank you we can stand here as a
[25:49] redeemed blood washed people and lord we
[25:51] just want to give all honor glory and
[25:52] praise unto you
[25:54] in jesus christ's name we ask these
[25:55] things amen
[25:57] amen god bless you friends i want to um
[25:59] there was a statement that brother
[26:00] freddie made on on the friday
[26:03] uh evening he said he said that you know
[26:07] we need to experience the power of god's
[26:09] word
[26:11] he's made that statement we need to
[26:12] experience the power of god's word it
[26:14] really struck me
[26:15] where he didn't say we need to
[26:17] experience or
[26:19] understand the word we need to
[26:21] experience the power of the word
[26:24] very different thing to understand the
[26:26] word which is good we should understand
[26:28] it
[26:28] but the power in that word when it's
[26:30] released into a people
[26:32] that's a very different thing now we
[26:34] read here in
[26:35] in first samuel because david was the
[26:38] one ordained to experience the power
[26:41] of what god told samuel so the word that
[26:44] was given to samuel was go to jesse
[26:46] jesse's house i have a king among the
[26:48] sons that was the word
[26:50] but every other son that went before
[26:52] samuel
[26:53] was not ordained to experience the power
[26:55] of that word but there was one in the
[26:57] house that was
[26:58] and he experienced the power of that
[27:00] word because david was i mean jesse was
[27:02] sorry samuel was told that one of your
[27:05] jesse's sons is going to be my king so
[27:07] he
[27:07] already in him was going to be the king
[27:09] but when that word became flesh
[27:12] you know became living when when the
[27:14] prophet anointed him he experienced the
[27:16] power of that word
[27:17] and then he began to show the dominion
[27:19] the power that was
[27:20] because he was a king a king is in
[27:22] charge a king isn't the one that
[27:24] you know you know is is beaten down
[27:26] trodden down he has dominion
[27:28] and then now he began to experience all
[27:30] the days of his life
[27:32] after that he began to experience the
[27:33] power of that word
[27:35] so so for example he went to look after
[27:38] the sheep again
[27:39] an enemy came into his domain there was
[27:41] there was a lion
[27:43] and he and the anointing came upon him
[27:44] he killed the lion he experienced the
[27:46] power of that word
[27:47] and then a bigger enemy came along a
[27:49] bear and then he experienced the power
[27:51] of that word
[27:52] right the anointing you know made that
[27:53] word live in his life again and he
[27:55] killed the bear
[27:56] and then a bigger enemy came in which
[27:57] was goliath
[27:59] and you know no doubt maybe because
[28:01] david remember
[28:02] israel the rest of israel knew it could
[28:04] be done they knew that goliath could be
[28:06] killed
[28:07] but david it was revealed to david the
[28:10] prophet said that goliath was going down
[28:12] so really god's program ever yeah i've
[28:16] got the quote here from perfect strength
[28:17] and perfect weakness
[28:19] uh brother brown says that god has a
[28:22] strategy
[28:24] and and and i like this strategy
[28:27] he's speaking now firstly speaking of of
[28:30] of the day you know after the
[28:31] resurrection and you know
[28:32] you know the disciples went fishing and
[28:34] you know they see the lord on the
[28:36] on the seashore you're having bread and
[28:38] fish by the fire and
[28:39] john has a bit of an eagle vision he can
[28:42] say it's the lord he tells peter peter
[28:43] jumps in the water he swims towards the
[28:45] lord
[28:46] not knowing that that that he would he
[28:47] would be received or not but he went
[28:49] anyway
[28:50] and that's the best thing you know you
[28:51] feel wrong you feel condemned just go to
[28:52] the lord anyway
[28:54] amen that's what that's what peter did
[28:56] so he says here
[28:57] he says now he thought he was a great
[28:59] man speaking of peter chop the high
[29:01] priest son's ear off like that or
[29:02] whoever it was well he thought he was a
[29:04] great fellow
[29:05] you know he had learned something but he
[29:07] knowed nothing
[29:08] he had to forget all about it and there
[29:11] he was out there
[29:12] said well i know one thing i'm a
[29:13] fisherman i can still make a living
[29:15] fishing
[29:15] he cast all night and didn't get nothing
[29:18] oh what a discourage
[29:19] every time he pulled it up an empty net
[29:22] and it was so discouraged he was so
[29:24] discouraged
[29:24] he was at the weakest point he said i
[29:26] just might as well feel like jumping off
[29:28] this boat
[29:29] i ain't worth nothing anyhow and then he
[29:33] and then he heard a voice saying have
[29:34] you caught any fish children
[29:36] he looked up on the bank and and there
[29:38] stood a man he said no we've toiled all
[29:40] night taken nothing i thought i was a
[29:42] fisherman
[29:43] is that you simon yeah well i toiled all
[29:45] night taken nothing
[29:46] oh we ain't got no fish out here he said
[29:49] cast your net on the other side
[29:50] we've done what then he said oh the
[29:53] other side we've been doing that cast it
[29:54] on the other side
[29:55] he throwed his nets out and he pulled it
[29:57] he said oh then he becomes strong oh
[29:59] mine
[30:00] he grabbed up his old fish coat put it
[30:02] on around him brethren
[30:03] that's who it is he beat the rest of
[30:04] them to the bank before they could
[30:06] rowing their boats as fast as they could
[30:08] he outswammed them with a fish coat on
[30:11] got to the bank why when he was strong
[30:13] he couldn't do nothing but when he got
[30:16] weak then he got strong
[30:17] yes sir and he says oh god strategy
[30:21] you want to hear god's strategy here's
[30:23] god's strategy is to take an empty human
[30:25] vessel
[30:26] and shake the world with them that's
[30:28] god's program
[30:29] god's strategy take an empty human
[30:31] vessel you know when you when we can
[30:33] take our own human ability and cast it
[30:35] to one side
[30:36] because all it will do is bring
[30:37] discouragement like peter
[30:39] amen but when we when we so is to take a
[30:42] empty human vessel
[30:43] shake the world with them oh just a
[30:45] little bit we'll go
[30:46] look at pentecost at pentecost what did
[30:48] he do it taken them 10 days to get all
[30:51] emptied up
[30:52] but they was all standing there with
[30:53] their vessels turned up and god took
[30:55] himself and filled them up
[30:57] that's all they shook the world he
[30:59] poured himself into them
[31:01] hallelujah and he's the same yesterday
[31:03] today and forever
[31:04] i mean that's what we need today that's
[31:06] what we need is empty vessels yes sir
[31:08] so god can fill them up hallelujah see
[31:12] peter
[31:12] peter saw a lot of things the lord did
[31:14] he was even anointed
[31:16] to cast out devils heal the sick but he
[31:19] still had not
[31:20] experienced the power of god's word
[31:24] because the power of god's word for that
[31:25] season was terry in jerusalem and i'm
[31:27] going to fill you with myself
[31:29] and shake the world you'll be endured
[31:30] with on power from on high
[31:32] hallelujah so david david came down
[31:36] and he and he faced goliath remember he
[31:38] was a king he was a little boy but he
[31:39] was a king that was the main thing it
[31:41] doesn't matter how big you are how old
[31:42] you are if you're anointed
[31:45] hallelujah if the word is living through
[31:47] you that's the main thing
[31:48] and he just looked and you know saul
[31:50] saul was head and shoulders above the
[31:52] rest of israel he was
[31:53] the one physically who could have done
[31:55] the job but you know he was shaking in
[31:56] his boots
[31:57] backslidden king in his tent a little
[31:59] shepherd boy comes and begins to testify
[32:02] of killing a lion and a bear
[32:03] and he just put you know god's healed
[32:06] once
[32:06] he'll heal again he delivered once he'll
[32:09] he'll deliver again
[32:10] demon power got cast out here the same
[32:12] one will be cast out in the same way
[32:15] hallelujah that enemy that came against
[32:17] us before we're going to beat this one
[32:18] as well
[32:20] amen that's what that's what david said
[32:21] well the lion and the bear and goliath
[32:23] just in the same category
[32:25] amen say you know hallelujah so god's
[32:29] strategy is to take empty human vessels
[32:31] and fill them with themselves and shake
[32:32] the world
[32:33] hallelujah so here comes david goliath
[32:36] makes this boast
[32:37] david just tells him what's going to
[32:38] happen we don't need to make a boast or
[32:40] paint up a big picture
[32:42] this is just how it's going to be i'm
[32:44] going to cut your head off he says
[32:46] he didn't even have a sword but goliath
[32:47] had carried his own sword
[32:49] hallelujah and then no doubt he begins
[32:51] to whirl the swing
[32:52] i mean whirl the sling around
[32:56] and it's the last it's the last noise
[32:58] that goliath ever hears
[33:02] and he and then and then god annoys that
[33:04] stone and goes straight to the killing
[33:06] place
[33:07] why because a king was anointed
[33:10] and he was experiencing the power of
[33:11] god's word for his life
[33:14] now we are the bride of christ we're
[33:17] more than an earthly king
[33:19] right david was we know he represents
[33:21] christ coming into power but he also
[33:22] represents a church coming into
[33:24] power right so even in david's life you
[33:26] should be able to see yourself
[33:28] but so but we must understand that was
[33:30] just a shadow pointing to a reality and
[33:32] now we are on this side of calvary the
[33:34] reality
[33:35] so his life that he was living was
[33:37] pointing to a people in the end time
[33:40] hello people at the end time how we're
[33:42] doing so so he had a dominion remember
[33:44] he experienced a word and that word was
[33:46] going to take him to the throne
[33:47] that word was going to help him overcome
[33:49] his enemies that word would even help
[33:50] overcome himself hallelujah how did he
[33:53] overcome himself when god
[33:55] anointed the prophet nathan or whoever
[33:57] it was to point out his sin
[33:59] he was quick to acknowledge that he was
[34:01] wrong and he repented
[34:03] amen that's that's someone that's really
[34:05] going to overcome when we can take
[34:06] ownership of the things we do
[34:09] and say lord we're wrong forgive me lord
[34:12] hallelujah
[34:12] that's a victorious believer glory
[34:17] hallelujah he didn't try and patch it up
[34:21] when you know when god put his finger it
[34:22] was about apparently two years after the
[34:24] deed to where nathan walked into the
[34:26] throne room
[34:26] maybe he thought it was all done and
[34:28] dusted
[34:30] oh boy i know not in god's telly book
[34:34] hey ben but we are more than just an
[34:37] earthly
[34:38] king we're under a word
[34:43] the bride is experiencing the word of
[34:46] god's power the power of god's word
[34:49] when this book came open it told you a
[34:51] few things it told you
[34:53] your your real identity right as we
[34:55] heard at camp we're not from new zealand
[34:57] we're not from
[34:58] wherever you're from we're not from that
[35:00] place that's where we started our
[35:01] earthly journey but our journey started
[35:03] in the mind of god
[35:04] right and we began to find out as the
[35:06] word came open to us that we are from
[35:08] god we're going back to god
[35:10] hallelujah that god is in control of our
[35:12] lives and we're
[35:13] we're living under a prophecy just like
[35:16] mary was the one who was ordained
[35:18] to be the one that would bring jesus to
[35:20] the earth to actually you know
[35:22] birth his natural body no one else was
[35:24] qualified to do the job
[35:26] in terms of in god's mind when god
[35:28] anointed isaiah said
[35:30] a virgin shall conceive he knew exactly
[35:32] who was going to be
[35:33] he knew where she would be knew her age
[35:36] knew where she was living knew exactly
[35:38] when the angel gabriel would come and
[35:39] speak to her
[35:40] all the events of her life were planned
[35:42] out already
[35:44] but it was just carried in that little
[35:45] word a virgin shall conceive
[35:47] and a lot of you know brother braham
[35:49] said a lot of devout israelites you know
[35:51] when they heard that prophecy they said
[35:52] my daughter's going to be the one
[35:54] but that prophecy hung for about 200 800
[35:57] years
[35:58] until an ordained vessel was upon the
[36:00] earth that was connected with that word
[36:04] and it's the same thing with malachi 4
[36:05] that was been that's been sitting in the
[36:07] scriptures for 2 000 odd years
[36:10] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[36:12] before the great and dreadful death of
[36:13] the lord he shall turn the hearts of the
[36:14] children to the fathers
[36:16] that part's been sitting there but it
[36:18] had to be an ordained time
[36:20] for an ordained people hallelujah had to
[36:23] have the technology to record his voice
[36:25] upon tape
[36:26] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[36:28] angel all these things had to be there
[36:30] he had to be here but then god when when
[36:32] god thought because
[36:34] who's who's included in that prophecy
[36:35] behold i that's god
[36:38] send you who's to you that's me send you
[36:41] elijah the prophet who's that
[36:43] that's the ministry of brother branham
[36:44] right so just condense in that small
[36:47] phrase as the whole bride
[36:51] and their hearts being turned back to
[36:52] the original faith of the fathers the
[36:54] word living through them
[36:56] amen amen the word becoming material in
[36:58] them
[36:59] it's got you in that verse it's got god
[37:01] in that verse and it's got the prophet
[37:03] in that verse
[37:04] hallelujah before the great and dreadful
[37:05] day of the lord and even the time when
[37:07] that would be fulfilled
[37:09] hallelujah so now the bride experiences
[37:12] the word very differently
[37:14] to i'd say anyone else now you
[37:18] people say well you're trying to be
[37:19] exclusive no
[37:22] but i'm special to god
[37:25] right in my heart i believe just you
[37:28] know i just love it if just everyone
[37:29] just became a believer
[37:31] you know i mean i mean like the entire
[37:32] world everyone believer not just some
[37:34] people
[37:34] everyone wouldn't that be cool wouldn't
[37:37] they just be so amazing
[37:38] you know i i'd love that hallelujah
[37:42] be incredible anyway but whosoever will
[37:45] let them come
[37:46] and so god ordained
[37:50] a word and there's power in that word
[37:53] to change a people that they will
[37:56] actually manifest the promise for their
[37:57] day
[37:59] you take you take their disciples they
[38:01] heard the same preaching everyone else
[38:02] heard
[38:03] but it spoke to them like it didn't
[38:04] speak to them they didn't try and figure
[38:06] you know
[38:07] they had the same kind of ears they they
[38:08] heard the same kind of language but
[38:10] something anchored in their souls
[38:12] hallelujah and that word took them to
[38:14] the upper room where the very god
[38:16] jehovah god came and dwelt in them and
[38:18] lived his life out of them
[38:19] the woman of the well heard the same
[38:21] kind of saw the same kind of discernment
[38:22] that everyone else did
[38:24] but it spoke to her like only
[38:27] god can speak to a predestinated scene
[38:30] and brother brahm said the reason that
[38:31] she came to life is because she had
[38:33] representation in heaven
[38:35] who's heard the future home he uses the
[38:37] woman at the well and the scribes and
[38:39] pharisees
[38:40] he says the scribes and pharisees
[38:41] appeared holy but they had no
[38:42] representation in heaven
[38:44] so when the light came across their path
[38:46] it just blackened them out
[38:47] but the woman at the well her life her
[38:49] natural life was she was an outcast no
[38:51] one wanted her you'd never think she'd
[38:53] be called the bride of jesus christ
[38:55] at all you never think she'd be in the
[38:57] economy of god but in god's mind she had
[38:59] representation in heaven
[39:01] so when the light came along her way it
[39:04] just lit her up
[39:06] says we know when messiah cometh he'll
[39:07] do these things and he just said he that
[39:09] speaks the uh
[39:10] am he and she ran into the yo dropped a
[39:13] water pot ran into the city look i've
[39:15] i met the messiah he's here hallelujah
[39:19] the power of that word came upon her
[39:22] changed your life hallelujah
[39:27] i think that's an incredible thing who's
[39:30] experienced that kind of thing
[39:32] one day you hear it and it's different
[39:34] one day hearing it's living
[39:36] hallelujah it changes you you don't
[39:38] change you it changes you
[39:40] you may have tried to change yourself
[39:41] you just fail but when it changes you
[39:43] when you give your life something in you
[39:45] just says i want to give myself to you
[39:46] lord jesus
[39:47] and he moves on your life and transforms
[39:49] you and sure you have your ups and downs
[39:50] but you weren't the person you were
[39:52] that's the thing i'm not that guy
[39:54] anymore whoever that guy is he's in the
[39:55] past i'm this guy
[39:57] holy and then in a year's time i said
[39:58] i'm not that guy i'm no more more like
[40:01] the lord hallelujah
[40:04] [Music]
[40:05] now i don't want to be too long
[40:09] brother brown makes a statement
[40:13] he says it in the presence of god
[40:15] unrecognized
[40:18] as in i believe it's in 1964.
[40:22] he says this little woman so you speak
[40:23] about the woman with the blood issue
[40:26] um this little woman had an issue of
[40:29] blood and she heard
[40:30] about him and when she come down there
[40:33] regardless of what anybody said
[40:35] she recognized who he was and she said
[40:39] if i can only touch his garment now
[40:41] remember he's still the high priest we
[40:43] touched by the feeling of our
[40:44] infirmities
[40:46] amen that's why brother brown would say
[40:48] when when when the
[40:49] you know the angel lord would be there
[40:50] he'd call people out in the in the
[40:52] congregation not even in the prayer line
[40:54] he says you sir are you ma'am this and
[40:56] this this he asked the question
[40:57] who did they touch and he says he's a
[41:00] high priest you touched by the feeling
[41:02] of your infirmities
[41:03] and the re and what he's trying to get
[41:05] the people to recognize is that high
[41:06] priest the lord jesus
[41:08] is not just up in heaven but he's
[41:09] actually in the building using the
[41:11] prophet to
[41:12] to to speak to people because by faith
[41:15] they're touching jesus
[41:16] right but he's on the platform using
[41:18] human lips telling them
[41:20] you've touched my garment
[41:21] [Music]
[41:23] amen and that same jesus is here
[41:27] hallelujah because brother brown says
[41:28] that pillow fire accompanies the message
[41:30] always
[41:31] that same god not a different one not
[41:33] unless it won the same one
[41:35] hallelujah and when she was come down
[41:39] i mean so and when she come down there
[41:41] regardless of what
[41:42] anybody said she recognized who he was
[41:45] and she said if i can only touch his
[41:47] garment said and when that genuine faith
[41:50] in god
[41:51] became a positive thing to her what did
[41:53] it release
[41:54] it released his power to heal her it's
[41:57] all about your approach
[41:58] your your attitude towards the word of
[42:00] god brother brahman says will determine
[42:02] your eternal destination
[42:03] your attitude towards it it's not your
[42:06] performance your attitude
[42:07] what you it's not what you think about
[42:09] yourself it's your attitude
[42:11] so if you value it it's just nothing
[42:12] well you'll get that reward if you value
[42:14] this is god in print form
[42:17] amen amen the message reveals christ
[42:20] contained in that message is the
[42:21] revelation of jesus christ
[42:24] amen amen
[42:27] that same jesus so it's your it's your
[42:29] attitude towards it
[42:32] see it released a power to heal her it
[42:35] touched him in such a way he turned
[42:36] around
[42:37] and told her what was wrong with her and
[42:40] said your faith has saved you what did
[42:42] faith
[42:42] others standing there might have been
[42:44] sicker than she but you see she
[42:46] recognized his presence
[42:48] she knowed that that was her opportunity
[42:52] if we could only do that tonight people
[42:55] if we could only realize that he's
[42:57] appearing to us
[42:58] in these meetings for one purpose do you
[43:01] want to know what the
[43:02] do you believe he's appearing among us
[43:05] right part of the coming is his
[43:06] appearing emerges all together
[43:09] you believe his presence you know as i
[43:11] say camp wasn't enthusiasm it was
[43:13] anointed
[43:15] we weren't excited just because we're at
[43:16] camp no god came and met us
[43:19] right we have meetings in here and god
[43:20] moves it's not our enthusiasm it's god
[43:22] anointing people
[43:24] see people scream and shout and get
[43:26] changed and things happen
[43:27] it's it's god it's coming it's his
[43:30] presence
[43:31] hallelujah you know
[43:34] people say i wish i could go back and
[43:36] live in jesus day you don't have to go
[43:38] back there
[43:38] you don't have to invent a time machine
[43:40] and go back there he's still the same
[43:41] god today
[43:42] he's the same in every detail apart from
[43:44] his physical corporal body which we'll
[43:46] meet in the air
[43:47] but everything he was he still is amen
[43:51] so
[43:52] he says she knowed that was her
[43:53] opportunity so i'm just repeating but
[43:55] if we could only do that people if we
[43:57] could only recognize he's appearing to
[43:58] us in these meetings for one purpose who
[44:00] wants to know what the purpose is
[44:03] that's to release our desires that we
[44:06] have
[44:07] in him to us that's why he appears among
[44:10] us
[44:11] to release our desires that we have in
[44:14] him to us
[44:16] hallelujah that's why he went to the
[44:18] woman of the well she had a burden
[44:21] or the one with the blood issue she had
[44:22] a sickness or blind bartimaeus his
[44:24] desire was lord i want to see again
[44:27] so he cried out with his faith not not
[44:29] necessarily just his voice but his faith
[44:31] got a hold of jesus jesus was on his way
[44:33] to calvary
[44:34] and his faith made him stand still and
[44:36] meet his knee because he's never walking
[44:38] through jericho that way again
[44:39] you go read it in the gospels and so he
[44:41] had a desire lord i want to i want to
[44:43] see again
[44:44] and he heard of this jesus of nazareth
[44:46] and recognized he was passing his way so
[44:48] it called out jesus thou son of david
[44:50] have mercy on me
[44:51] hallelujah and so he recognized
[44:54] the presence of god was walking past him
[44:57] and
[44:58] it released the desire he had
[45:02] in him lord i want to see lord you're a
[45:04] healer
[45:06] hallelujah amen the centurion
[45:10] recognize the presence of god he had a
[45:13] sick
[45:14] a sick servant who knows a story i trust
[45:16] yeah i trust the gospels are more than
[45:18] stories
[45:18] but you can really literally put
[45:20] yourself there you can be standing in
[45:21] the roman sandals you can be talking to
[45:23] the son of man
[45:24] how you can have a conversation with him
[45:26] and say lord i'm not worthy you come
[45:28] under my roof but you know just as i'm a
[45:30] man under authority i tell this one come
[45:32] here this one do this i know you're
[45:33] under authority as well
[45:34] you know you have power you know you
[45:36] just speak the word only
[45:38] and i know that you are your word this
[45:39] is gentile faith now that
[45:41] jesus is his word so he knew that jesus
[45:44] speaking the word was exactly the same
[45:46] as jesus walking in
[45:48] laying his hands upon his sick servant
[45:50] and pronouncing him
[45:51] him healed exactly the same thing amen
[45:54] hallelujah
[45:55] so we shall recognize now the word of
[45:57] god is upon the earth
[45:59] he is the word he's he's upon the earth
[46:01] he's a real being
[46:02] right and he's present oh that's why we
[46:05] don't need to see now scarred hands we
[46:07] see his spirit moving
[46:09] hallelujah amen so that
[46:12] released to the centurion the desire he
[46:16] had
[46:16] in him his servant got well dries
[46:20] came to the end of himself where his
[46:22] daughter was deathly sick
[46:24] and he had to laugh at his reputation as
[46:26] a leader in the synagogue didn't care
[46:28] what anyone else said about him
[46:30] he put on his little preacher's coat and
[46:31] went found jesus of nazareth
[46:34] and said master come to my house my my
[46:36] daughter's gonna die
[46:38] and they were walking you know jesus
[46:40] consented because he always comes where
[46:41] he's invited and you know
[46:43] on the way a servant comes says don't
[46:44] trouble the master she's dead
[46:47] but he went anyway raised her from the
[46:48] dead so her his desire was that she
[46:51] would be made whole and it's amazing
[46:55] his desire was just she's alive but
[46:57] she'll be made well
[46:58] but the lord took that desire even
[47:00] though she was dead and brought her back
[47:02] to life
[47:04] hallelujah why because jurais recognized
[47:07] the presence of god
[47:10] hallelujah and it released the desire
[47:15] that he had it released his desire that
[47:19] he had for his daughter to be made sick
[47:21] in him to him amen hallelujah and you
[47:24] can go all the way down through the
[47:25] scripture the shunammite woman to elijah
[47:27] i believe it was you go through all of
[47:29] them
[47:29] they had a desire they recognized the
[47:31] presence of god and it released their
[47:33] desire to them
[47:35] had he right had a burden let's just
[47:36] let's just jump right down to
[47:38] 2 000 years down the road she had a
[47:40] burden the salvation of her family
[47:43] and she recognized his brother brown
[47:46] maybe he's still in his
[47:47] his uh hunting outfit i don't know but
[47:49] they're just talking about hunting
[47:50] and then begins to talk about the spoken
[47:52] word the spur you know your squirrels
[47:54] being spoken into existence and
[47:56] something anchors in her heart that's
[47:58] nothing but the truth
[47:59] and then god but remember she's carrying
[48:01] a burden she's not really worried
[48:03] interested in squirrels
[48:05] she wants the salvation of her boys
[48:07] right that's what she wants
[48:09] and so she recognized the prince of god
[48:11] she recognized this is not
[48:13] he's not making this up this is not just
[48:15] a story this is not even some polished
[48:17] up idea
[48:17] this really happened and she just
[48:20] recognized this is the truth
[48:22] and then the lord came down and we know
[48:25] the rest of the story
[48:26] yes sister how do you ask what you will
[48:29] you want a million dollars if it doesn't
[48:31] fall in your lap when you ask for it you
[48:33] call me a false prophet what about your
[48:34] sister here's a wheelchair what about
[48:36] your
[48:37] parents who are old what about this farm
[48:38] you know
[48:40] but her desire wasn't for stuff
[48:43] her sister could get old and die or you
[48:45] know she could heal but die her parents
[48:47] were old already
[48:48] who cares about a farm really
[48:53] you know so heaven with your family or a
[48:56] farm for just a
[48:57] little you know who cares about material
[49:00] things really
[49:01] what's really mattering you know sure we
[49:03] have to do all that kind of stuff but
[49:05] what's the main thing what's the main
[49:06] burden you're carrying
[49:08] the main one and so she had that burden
[49:11] she's i want the salvation of my two
[49:12] boys
