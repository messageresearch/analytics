bless you musicians thank you I mean it's great to have plans here god bless you just you feel at home it's wonderful to have sister Robins parents here god bless you welcome god bless you trust you feel at home amen well it was good well it's good to be home got your Bibles handy we'll go to the book of Nehemiah chapter four and one and then we're going to go to Ephesians chapter six so all the saints in our fielding sin their love and this coming weekend they're all going to come down and brother Alf was going to preach for us so come expecting we're gonna have a glorious time so that's this coming Sunday I mean so yeah praise the Lord Nehemiah four and one Nehemiah Esther job Lewis EMR forum I just want to take a scripture from here I'm gonna read one scripture from Sonia ma gonna read chapter four verses one down to verse six and then we're gonna read Ephesians six and twelve it's an email horn one this is Nehemiah they're rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burnt and the answered all those is yes now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build of a fox go up he shall break this stone wall here o our God for we are despised and turn their upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity cover not their iniquity not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked me to anger before the builders so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together until the half thereof for the people had a mind to work I mean it was go to Ephesians six and twelve I'm just gonna read this one scripture here and we may come back to the book of Ephesians so if you wish to keep it handy see how far we get this morning on this Ephesians six and twelve very familiar scripture I'm sure for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places Amen may the Lord bless this word this morning you may have your seats I wonder I want to take a bit of oh maybe just an introduction we'll see how far we go but I want to take a thought and and we'll get down to it and I want to speak on divide and conquer this is the enemy strategy is to divide and conquer and I'm going to show you that as he has divided and he's conquered nations and peoples then he comes right down into the family and he divides and conquers the family the same way so this is where I'm going to go but in the same but in the same token we are living in a season just like Jeremiah and the Jews were in that in that season where where they had been called out of Babylon they have come back into the promised land and now they have to rebuild they have to rebuild the city and it's just like us we were you know if you if you're going to church history you see the churches birth to Pentecost and then and then the Creed's of man were mixed in as they went along and a Council of Nicaea and then the and then the church world went into darkness into the dark ages and it went into Babylon a winter confusion but then they came alike you're a Reformation started and and the call begin to come coming out my people come out of her my people and then so we've heard that call in mistake come out of her my people beam up I take ever since so we've we've been called out of Babylon out of confusion our mystery babylon we're being called and we've come into our inheritance into the Holy Ghost now we have to build now we have to rebuild that which were that which they had in the beginning this is where I'm going you think well where are you going with this this is what I'm going that's the that's a sermon in a bottle as brother our man would say and I want to read this this is from a blushing prophet in 1956 brother Burns made a older call and people are people are coming and it says to see these young women coming weeping life before them throughout the crossroads they are victims of circumstances what he says do you realize old men when we were boys our boys has ten times the temptation we had sisters you realize that our daughters has ten times the temptation you had when you was a girl well what will her daughter have look at the things the picture pictures that devil is painting oh how we need to pray now we'll go back to you again brother do you realize you don't pray as half as much as our fathers did pastor do you know we don't put as much time in our knees as the pastor's before us that woman do you realize we don't instruct our daughters and pray with her at night like our mothers did you then what about it who's guilty we are guilty there's no way around it we're guilty he says I'm guilty I'm guilty of not doing the job of God like I should do now we say well that's pretty heavy but he's saying these are these young women that have come to the altar the Prophet saying they have victims of circumstance well what is the circumstance the circumstances that the family has become divided that the parents are not doing the job they should be doing now there is a responsibility of the children as well who's a child here who's living at home and is dependent on parents now the scripture tells you Amen this is for sister Robin now put her handle but the scripture says for children to obey the appearance and if you look at and I don't know if we'll get that far maybe we're next week but you read in Romans chapter 1 and you read in 2nd Timothy where all the description of all the sins and then there is disobedient appearance its fornication adultery coveted nurse whatever more idolatry and then disobeyed the parents is in there and God is not ranking them he's saying that is in the same bracket as things so a child a child responsibility even before they come to an age of accountability is to obey the appearance but then it says in the same token that fathers do not provoke your children to anger at least they'd be discouraged right so there is a way to do it but the children's responsibility to please God is to actually obey your parents and all the parents should say amen now there when real quiet on low what's happened so finally you've come in to bat for us for once now so there are victims these so what I just read there they are victims of the circumstance that the family unit has been divided they are they that is what they are victims of right because we have to understand now we know the world is evil we know it's the most what he called the most deceptive ages ever be and we know it's the darkest ages ever been but the power of God in this age is greater remember the the anointing that is present is always greater than the powers of the enemies always in every age so we can't we don't need to worry about oh it's so dark and we're living in Sodom and Gomorrah and the world is falling apart sure it is but but the anointing on the office of mom and dad I mean the anointing of the Living God will keep the children and will keep the family strong many admire they weren't your they they got distracted and what the Kings decree was and what the enemy was saying and they got discouraged and things but Nehemiah stayed focused we must build we're going to rebuild this it shall rise this prophecy that the house will be rebuilt hallelujah and the biggest now he say well had you stopped at that my children are victims of circumstance like like these ones it's very simple if the husband and wife relationship is solid in every way not just sharing a bedroom or sharing a house but you're connected body spirit and soul you're one if that is strong in the family unit is strong amen okay if that is strong then that will defeat everything but if there's a division now let's just go to know I'm gonna lower back round then Oh didn't someone remind me later first Corinthians eleven just see how good your memory is cuz we're going to go there there's a layer and a family there's layers of protection in the family and if those layers you say well my husband's not here or whatever more there's still a protection there for you for the family these layers of defense that God has placed in and it's when people stand in their office I mean they say I've been made it because remember it's not just prophets that are called or ministers or musicians or whatever more it's a calling to be a parent you're being ordained you got to understand if you have children if you have children got it before the foundation of world ordained you're gonna stand as a father you're gonna stand as a mother holy your standard a husband your standard as a wife it's a god-given office and God has called you to be in that office and there's power in that office hallelujah you've gotta um you gotta remember that you see cuz what is what is okay I don't want to jump ahead of myself now many times we criticize how young children act sisters dress brothers act but we are looking at the wrong thing they have victims of the circumstance of other influences coming in because parents are not in their position now you cannot stop the world being the world you know you can't just push a button and you know we can't just go find some mouth and top and build a monastery and live there I'd get a bit claustrophobic yeah we could but hey you know but but the world is still there right so you can't stop that happening but it's the influence of the godly mum and dad that influence always has to be greater in the world okay now Ecco I'm just gonna read a bit so it influences in 1964 now my subjects tinnitus influences you want to read this story turn to see in chronicles 26 chapter that's use I was a shepherd boy he was anointed king at the age of sixteen he was a godly man this man was a was a good man he had godly parents he did that which was right on the side of the Lord now we find that usually how he's identifying a problem and when the Prophet was standing here you just go I remember doing social stage at school and we learned about the 50s and the 60s and just as school had just showed after World War Two in the 50s and the 60s Society just changed completely and but the devil has been allowed to do it he's been allowed to do it you take you take it was in the paper a few years ago it was the anniversary of when the Beatles went to Australia when they did and it changed the whole social fabric of that country one one band touring around released an anointing into that country and it changed the face of it and it's just that's in the papers was documented there one visit and so now so there's all those things but the prophetsí is now we find I think today our gate a great problem of what we believed to be juvenile do delinquency is a parent delinquent a home delinquent our people got away from the things that they should have stayed with the church now notice what he's saying the church got lukewarm or cold and the children got out into the world so he's not saying the church got liberal and he's got lukewarm and cold he identifies that and when the Prophet speaks he's saying he's saying things very specifically even they say he's just throwing things he's not the right because he's putting an order this is this is what's happened as the church gets cold and lukewarm and then then the children get out into the world because the power and the church I mean should impact now I only have them maybe a Wednesday maybe a Sunday you've got them the rest of the week but when we come together see I want my children be raised in such an atmosphere they know what it's like to see God move they know us like the Feliz presents I mean I feel as anointing come down and see people be transformed Alou you I want them to know what that's like but it's not just in these four walls what happens that should happen at home hallelujah just just just the way we live the atmosphere we carry with us it should unpack them they should know the difference even if they can't maybe identify you know but they should something in the mud say this is God I don't know what this is out in the world they should they they should be you know and printed of them so strongly they should you know what it's like to be in an atmosphere which is terrible who knows what it's like we're not all you know but who knows what it's like to be in his presence they meant so oh I believe our children deserve that kind of being raised in that way now Nehemiah the reason he is successful as you read so Ezra was written before Nehemiah even though their contemporaries they they rebuilt the temple then they rebuilt the city so the word the place of worship was rebuilt first it's just like us God gets us and we're a bunch of rubble I mean we're lost and undone we were chaos and then God calls us and he and he transforms and our soul first and then he fixes the rest of us I mean that's God's patna toys from the inside out because it's from the outside and it's just a it's just a veneer until it hits the inside but it should be the inside first right and so now so they made the word pre have preeminence we must rebuild this temple first that was the burden they had enemies around them they had opposition they said we must rebuild this and they rebuilt it then they rebuilt the city and it's the same thing with you now and you'll see it in the Kings like user or here's a car you know they repaired as always you know you go look at the godly Kings they repair the holes in the temple they repay the temple first normally and then they fix the breaches in the in the city walls or whatever it is but that is their paramount that's what they want to do first we must repair the temple are you with me it's a pattern go go go look in the scripture and then they rebuild in they're successful and God looks after them because we are living in the Amaya's day you have to understand that you you look in the Old Testament and things that the believers went through back there is replaying itself today I could have gone to his a Kai's life and it's exactly the same thing here he is is a godly King he wants to place God take it take the idols out of the land you know rebuild the temple but then the Assyrians are coming and swallowing up everything around them that's exactly what's happening in this day that history repeats itself now Hollywood now I see says the church got lukewarm or cold and the children got out into the world now Hollywood puts out lots of movies and television so forth that's even unseen sit with a curse and use God's name in vain and he used to be it was wrong for children and the holiness churches to go to bio scopes or picture shows now Satan has got one jump ahead of it by bringing it right into the house in the form of television and in uncensored and so forth and that's Satan's way of gradually entering in now that the television is not the problem it's what goes through it is the problem just like you're just like your phone or your iPad or your computer it's nothing wrong with the device it's what is on the device okay now he sees on the same sermon he says that's right that's the one I'm just jumping down a bit now it ain't how close you can come it's how well uh and how well you think your fortify it say just as far away from sin as you can stay right just get as far away as you can I can do this there's no harm in doing this well if there's a question in your mind don't do it at all anything there's a question stay away from it then you see then you're absolutely living by faith if there's no question if there's a question then leave it don't go around it at all and I think that many times that it's the parents that get away he's talking about influences I know I use these quite a few months ago but I wanted to bring it out again I know that sometimes the schools and things that Sunday schools about half an hour an hour on Sunday morning and the world has the kids the rest of the weekend crammed into there more than than a teacher and sometimes many time and many times too many times the teachers got a little quarterly that she teaches about while she paints her lips fixes are here and it's children do the best they can and then they get home and they get no Christian training at all mother's out somewhere to a card party no this is a this is a family divided mother's out somewhere to a card party dad's down at the bowling alley and sisters out with somebody with a hot rod and here you are see where did we where did we go it's a divided family I know this is not a shouting rejoicing service but here we are this is a divided family but God in this this age the anointing of the Lord is to restore family s to bring the family as one unit we're walking together now I'll show you the anointing on the world power is to divide and conquer this is in contrast the anointing upon the believers in the state which is for God to completely rebuild as people as family units and as a bride body around the world into the image of the word this is this is the anointing the word this message has come to rebuild homes to rebuild family relationship husband wife relationship amen now we have been called just like you know we have been taken like the Jews in their near modern Israel day who every Church mix all day returns mix Island Babylon to rebuild Jerusalem and live in the promised land again they were taken out of there they were taken from Israel and sent into captivity in the beginning because they mixed their worship with idol worship and that's why God took them from the land as he promised they he would do but now history and so that is repeated where the church fell at Nicaea where church and state was united and Christianity was mixed with pagan religion and so and the church went into the dark ages but then there was the Reformation and in our full restoration and the same time Allu you you take like you know we can go back to the time of Gideon why is Gideon by himself threshing wheat where's his family where's his father helping you know why is he alone by himself trying to get some wheat it's because the enemy had coming because the people worshipping idols and had divided the family and what was the first thing Gideon was told to do hew down the idol in your father's house start the conquest there start the you know start the you know kicking the enemy out started at home first and then you can heal then you can you know kick them off your land amen the idol you say well we don't have any idols I wish I had that video of that skit from the skit boys how who seen it and and he takes a yo he says the oh these these people who may paint themselves up and they built you know and they build their temples and he's got actually photos of people tribes from Papua New Guinea you only kill it up and feathers and all kinds of things what they do and then he and the shows a temple and they offer sacrifice all these things he says well you can't relate to that okay I'll tell it again it says now there's people in May and they paintin themselves and these people go into these rugby matches and you know American football they're painted blue red white whatever more and they build big temples in his big Stadium and they offer sacrifices you know I was shocked the world's chopped but when the Blues played the Lions they they they had a special haka and you know what the purpose that Huckle was isn't the news we're calling up the spirit of our ancestors so he can defeat this team it was in the New Zealand Herald and people just read that saying oh that's fine but if you have half a Christian brain you would say that is ancestor worship that is pagan as pagan can be so why on earth would you want to identify yourself or your children with anything like that that's it's insanity and that's how oh that's the what do you why they do the haka they calling up we need an anointing to defeat this enemy there's a you know as a soccer team it just comes to mind from I think from from from the UK and it was like this greatest kind of season they've ahead least a city I saw y'all might have the name of a totally wrong but they like the total underdogs in they won what did they and did you see what they did before they started that season they went to a Buddhist temple they went to a Buddhist temple and they had a service there's on BBC news there's no conspiracy so they went to this Buddhist temple and they had the service what were they doing we need an anointing we want to win this trophy we need an anointing the this happened I think last year year before and they won why because they're calling up demon power to win but we're Christians you wanna you want to be careful what you put before you amen you want to be careful the influence you put on your children especially when they're young when they look at you and you're the most please whatever you're most pleased with them in their life they'll want to be walking they'll start running towards that so for example if I was just say if my my girls just say yeah just say yeah my girls they started playing a sport and I was the most enthusiastic a black stick or a silver fern or you know hockey or whatever game they were the whole ambition would begin to go towards that because I am predicting this is what I'm most pleased with with you even if they come to church and all these things what you're most pleased with they want to emulate that they all following me so you've got to be number one you've got to be dead sure whatever they do for the Lord you say I'm so proud of you I'm so pleased hallelujah you know you got to make that number one not not here with something else number one because they'll see cuz they want to be like you did or you mum they want to be like you and so they'll see or mum really love dad dad or mum really like me doing this so it's like the channels their ambition a certain way hello how we do it's true people you can't just you can't just have a Christian under yo are you we're Christians but in reality what are you really serving what are you placing above him because the family is divided because the because the parents are looking at other things now let's go to Daniel chapter 7 we're gonna read quite a lengthy reading from here Daniel 7 and we're gonna reverse one down to verse 23 you've got to understand and I trust you do but when you look at what is going on in the world it is all in the scripture you've got to look at the world through scriptural eyes because if you do not then you'll be caught up in the devil's lie and you'll be influenced the wrong way okay so if you can see what is happening through that through the scripture then you can identify oh this is this is what he's doing and this is what he's doing and this is what God is doing amen you got to be able to see and that's why it's so important to find yourself and Bible characters to go back into the scripture and find yourself as Nehemiah or David or David's mighty men are you with me you know what are those because you'll see because if that's the shadow that the believers of the New Testament are the reality so if they did it under the shadow that way and we'll do it in the reality hallelujah yes amen and you can take the same thing you can take the book of Acts you can take that New Testament era just from Pentecost to the destruction of Jerusalem and you can overlay it in this day we live in that's probably another time now Daniel 7 and 1 in the first year of Belshazzar we're going to read this and all we'll just yeah we go king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions on us dreams of his heat upon his beard when he wrote the dream and told the some of the matters and Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea and four great beasts come up from the sea diverse one from the other now this is the anointing on the world power right it's the end and we're gonna read about four beasts and the fourth beast is the anointing on the world power on this day and then I'm gonna show you that it breaks and destroys and devours the whole earth and I'm going to show you the tactic it uses in your life and your family life because it can't just the other Sun lofty thing in the it comes down to your Adria comes down to my address right that's where we're going and so first of all the first was like a lion and had eagle's wings and I beheld till the wings are over plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it and I beheld a second beast and the second was like like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise and devour much flesh and after this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl and the Beast had also four heads and Dominion was given to it and after this I saw in the night vision and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly Antti that devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns now what happens is that the first piece we read about was the it's the same as the image of image that the King Nebuchadnezzar dreams about of the head of gold and silver and you know goes down to iron and clay and the feet these are the anointings on those four kingdoms okay so the first beast we read about was the world Empire of Nebuchadnezzar's time and the next one was the Medes and Persians which took the Babylonian Kingdom and then the third one we just read about was the Grecian Empire because they remember Alexander the Great defeated was the Darius and he and he took the Empire now the fourth one it was diverse from all the beasts ever before it and it had ten horns everything in the first three is mixed into the fourth and I considered the horns so in our in verse eight I considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things now remember the Romans conquered the Greeks and that same anointing is on the world power till now that same it's a mule power we are living under the world was living under that anointing you say well there's no Roman Empire anymore that's true but it went from went from pagan Rome it changed the papal Rome and we can read about that in Revelations 13 and if you go especially into the mo you know the Dark Ages even into the room into the Renaissance even into today the Vatican has has embassies around the world and it's not just a church it's a country as opposed it's a it's a political animal amen you go look at you're looking the like King Henry the eighth's time you know you go look at European history politics there's the king and who was his Prime Minister ninety-nine percent of the time a cardinal and who was the Cardinal reporting to the Pope and who was the Pope and the Cardinal who where was his allegiance it wasn't to the king it was to the Pope so so it it controlled and it's the same thing today just in a different way yeah I mean we're anyway but the same thing this is this is here now and this happens until I beheld till the thrones were cast out an Ancient of Days that sent his garments were white as wool and the hair of his head were like pure wool as throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books are open so this is now this is now the great white throne judgement comes into view so that world powers here but then it's destroyed and here's the great white throne judgment okay and in verse 11 I beheld in because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame which is the lake of fire as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away their lives were prolonged for a season at a time and I saw and the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him Dominion and glory and kingdom and all the people nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom where that which shall not be destroyed now was gonna keep ready and I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me and I came nearer and I came near one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this and he told me to make and made me know the interpretation of of the things these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out of the earth but the Saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever now we're going to read that there's actually well we read there that the Saints are given the kingdom but then as we read down it all say that there that the Saints were made war against now worn out but then after judgment are given the kingdom now how can this be where one in one place it says they're given the kingdom and another place the Beast makes war against them and wears out the Saints of the Most High then after judgment they've given the kingdom it's because in the ranks member Saints being sanctified ones so it is all it is the wise and foolish virgin are encompassed in this in this verse so the wise are given the Kingdom they go up in the rapture I trust you one of them right but in the fullest version of stadia and then this beast power wears them out and overcomes them but then after judgment they've given the kingdom because remember the great white throne judgment the the the goats and the sheep are separated and the Sheep had put it into the kingdom and the goats a seat to the lake of fire now and then I'd know the truth of the fourth feast which was diverse from all the others exceedingly dreadful whose teeth rose of iron as nails of brass was devoured breaking pieces and stamped the residue with his feet and of the ten horns which were in his head and the other and of the other which came up before whom three fell even of that horn that that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look was more stout than his fellows I beheld and the same horn made war with the Saints and prevailed against them as the foolish virgin group until the Ancient of Days came and the judgment was given to the Saints of the Most High and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth Kingdom upon the earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces so that's what he's going to do he's going to devour the whole earth he's going to tread it down and he's going to break it into pieces and the ten horns out of this kingdom of ten Kings which shall arise another shall maybe I've gone through fer and the ten horns out of this kingdom which are ten Kings that shall arise in there and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings and he shall speak great words against the Most High and we shall wear out the Saints of the Most High and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a dividing of time so time is one x is two and a divided time is half three and a half three and a half years the Great Tribulation but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his Dominion and consume and to destroyed until the end and the Kingdom and Dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all dominions serve and obey Him here in 2 as the end of the matter as for me Daniel my cogging Nations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but I kept the matter in my heart so this you say well that's quite a lot of words but he's showing now this is what the devil's going to do he's going to devour the whole earth he's going to break it that he's going to break it into pieces and he's gonna treat it down as verse 23 so now here's this tactic he wants to devalue I'm just going to go from the world I'm gonna go down to you devour he wants a devalue I want to break you to pieces and treat you down and you can see we don't I don't know if we have time but go read revelations chapter 13 after this and it speaks about a it speaks about the same fourth piece we read about with the ten horns and it speaks about the Lamb coming out of the earth which is now a nation not come coming out of a place where there's not much population and that we know is America but then it says he he had he had he was a he was a lamb but then he spake as the dragon so they came a time in America's history where they were because of lamb is freedom of religion they left the old world to comes the new world to you know flee from the persecution of the denominations there they found it they founded the nation as one nation under God but then there comes a time where it turns and it speaks as the dragon speaks so it says the same thing that the Vatican is saying right and so and you'll see it and you know you'll see the tactics of the enemy and you can go from I remember when I read a book on the Boer War Boer War that the that the British they wanted the you know you know the gold and everything but it was outside their territory so they tried to create a incident where a group of them went up there and they tried to do that you know they thought all the British that were already there would rise up in arms and that overthrow the Bulls and it didn't work and then and in that they tried to create an incident where we had out start a war and they they proceeded with it anyway they wanted to devour the place and take control you look at now this is just me but that is just an fellowship I know this is on the internet but oh you look at the show September 11 you see what the enemy does he he he puts people into a place makes the place fall apart and he tries to clean up the pieces and take control you see September 11 have you ever seen such wonderful controlled demolition of buildings before have you looked at videos of controlled demolitions the building just goes and then you see the two towels gonna do perfectly but the planes hit the Midway up like this any any structural engineer would look at that and say that's crazy how could they just go this and there were other buildings around that they just collapsed as well you say well that is that is their building codes really shot or it was it was actually created to start a war to go devour some countries to take control of the resources you go look you go look at Wikipedia that remember all the stuff you say this is crazy no this is what the enemy does but you've got to look it through the Bible eyes you look it through scripture eyes because if you don't you'll be caught up in the misinformation out there and you'll be twisted one way or another yeah you go look at what the CIA has done around the world they've assassinated presidents they have they've armed yo rebel groups to take over countries this is in Central and South America you should go see what they've done the leader of Isis was captured by the Americans then he was released and then now now Isis came into being what's happened and it's been known that they've armed other rebel groups in Syria oh this is conspiracy no it's not this is what the enemy does because he wants to create a vacuum then I'll come save the day cuz I'm Captain America what do you think all the Hollywood movies are there was Rambo taking out the Soviets in Afghanistan and you know all these different yeah America is gonna save the day it's propaganda saying they're the good guys well not really they're not the good guys because they're under a beasts anointing to break the world into pieces and to subdue it you look at the yo you look at this world why is this wished wisest world and it countries are you look at Venezuela standing up against America now I'm not saying for or against but there's just what happened you know was a Hugo Chavez where his nameis is not we're going to do our own thing and then and then he dies and then go look at the country now this riding it's basically bankrupt it's broken what happened with with general I mean the main Colonel was a Gaddafi daran daran northern Africa what was he doing he's just there and then the in the Western powers create an incident and then they go invade the country they get rid of him a look down to chaos well controlling the oil and all these things you gotta look at through braking and then I think countries go on to debt then he comes to mr. IMF International Monetary Fund will help you or help us we'll help you now who do they now who does the country answer to you have to look at these things look at what's going on in America if you if you haven't seen the documentary I've only I heard brother Lonnie Jenkins preach about called the agenda and and the agenda it's a film not made by believers but they but this but this fellow he it was and I think low level politics used to write a letter to the editor it was often and then one day he wrote about the time when he went to a communist party convention thing in America at the time when the Soviet Union was falling apart and the Communist Party in America said this is how we're going to break America we're gonna break immorally we're gonna make her a breaker spiritually and will break her financially and and then so he wrote about that or something along those lines and he just got a massive response and you go look at America what's happened she's been broken spiritually she's been broken morally and how much did let's just raise the debt ceiling I don't know what trillion it is now what what and then what happens well who can pay the debt off maybe my brother Brown who speaks about all these things and he says he says the Vatican has the gold and The Wall Street has all the paper bonds you know their brother paint yo you know they've got the documents your the bonds but only me and then who's going to pay their debt off here comes the Vatican and we can help you out we have all the gold and then what's happened it's the Bible is prophecy brother Bram speaks about these things we are not water and then now you look at America look at what's going on with these yo yo you're the racism and all these things going on the country is falling apart why cuz it's being it's being devoured by the own anointing on itself is devouring itself they meant and people take sides and you know whatever it is the Bible says the world to be drunk let's read that and in in Revelations 18 and 1 down to verse 5 I'm still talking about families by the way but I'm showing you this is the tactic of the enemy because it's not just national level it comes down into your home if you can see what he does there you'll see what he does down here and then look at what's happening and look at look at what what what husbands and fathers are betrayed of betrayed as in the media Homer Simpson he's the he's the typical dad or husband these days this is what's being projected so what's happened now the family is being divided manhood has been broken down amen being a real husband a real dad that's been broken down I meant woman have been lifted up and made objects by the fashion world and if you looked at your they've done studies where because you know how they they they put electrodes and stuff on people's brains and they see which cuts of their brain light up when certain things happen you know they do those studies they did this study so they took me in and they showed them pictures of just just objects like a hammer or a rake or a tool and and certain hemispheres of the brain lit up and then they showed those same men pictures of of half-naked woman you know these models and all these things and the same hemispheres lit up and that's showing that subconsciously when a man sees a woman stripped off naked subconsciously he just says she is a tool she is not a woman amen and this is what the world is now predicted you have to be like this certain thing and all it's liberating no but subconsciously man looks at you and says well actually you're just a tool so woman have been degraded in this day and brother Bram said if you break motherhood you break a nation yeah that's true and after these things revelations 18 and one and after these things to me I I wouldn't I don't want to be treated as at all I feel just an object I'm a person amen it's like it's like all you wonderful sisters you know two objects don't leave the devil trying to grade you down you just a a tool you're a daughter of God revelations 18 one and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants but be of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that you received not of her plagues for her sins have reached into unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities now this angel this angel here is actually the Ministry of the Prophet where the whole earth is lighted with his glory and he identifies he identifies that Babylon is fallen is fallen I mean the the church system has fallen and says this is the state of her and all nations have been made drunk now what is the what is the tip what is the West especially water what it mean pursue men a woman who pursued we just want a good time we just want a good time we just want to you know sure we have to go to work but you know we just want to pad it up on the weekend we want to go on holiday you know we just want to we just want to enjoy ourselves nothing wrong with enjoying yourself or going on holiday but it's the pursuit and we want to you know we want to refurbish our homes we want all the nice things and people are pursuing these things what's happened all they they get drunk and on pleasure you following me you know the whole world is drunk you know you look at I saw I saw the ignore ignore Gration of President Trump I watched a part of it when they're just walking where they go from where he's where he's sworn in and he's taken I think to the White House and there's like a procession and one part of it is they get out of the limo and they and they walk along where all the people are cheering and I just watch the book where they got out there started walking and I thought to myself this world is drunk because it liked me back in the world I mean when you were back there I trust you're still not back there as if you had a party you don't want some sober guy running your party he's no fun a mint because he is as you know he's no fun you want the guy who's the craziest he does that you know you want him if you're drunk you want that kind of guy if you're sober you don't want that kind of guy and it's and it's like the world why'd they want all we need a we need to save you for America and they get this guy in they wanting their Messiah and and they well the church world over there believes that they heaven and he's a you know this world was made this world is made and then here we are and we're on this side of the world and we just coast along let's just watch what happens though yeah do we not New Zealand just looks out yeah let's just float along she'll be right no worries sweet ass bro what is that that's like some guy sitting in the corner of a party just he just watches it go by he's chill he's not worried it should be worried you don't want to be like that guy I'm not trying to tell jokes but it's how people are this just float don't let's not float let's build this bit let's rebuild Alleluia so now dividing and conquering now the enemy and I might just actually wind up with this I don't want to be too long this morning maybe just for just low foundation but the enemy today is a Roman tactic called divide and conquer who's heard of that who all knows about hide and conquer now they actually adopted that from the Greeks if you go read on Wikipedia because what happens is the Romans they if they found anything good from the place they conquered they absorbed it into the earth into their military into this society so the divide and conquer strategy has been used so this is this is just one example from from Africa which you know I'm sure you're all aware of so the Germans and the Belgium's they ruled Rwanda and Burundi in a colonial capacity now this is just this is just verbatim from from Wikipedia the Germans used a strategy of divide and conquer by placing members of the already dominant Tutsi minority in positions of power when Belgium took over in 1916 the Tutsis and Hutus groups were rearranged according to race I mean yeah according to race instead of occupation Belgium defined tootsies anyone with more than ten cows or a long-nosed while who to meet someone with less than ten cows and a broad knows the socio-economic divide between Tutsis and Hutus continued after independence and was a major factor in the Rwandan genocide the vote what's happened now he comes as fourth beast power coming into a into a continent divide and conquer that's how the British they could be successful against the Scots as well this divide and conquer they meant playing playing one clan against the other you look at New Zealand here come you know you're a read about the musket wars before the land Wars where the musket Wars come from here come missionaries will give you muskets and they arm this tribe because it's going to help their cause and then this tribe massacres this tribe because this tribe doesn't have muskets and this one does have you read have you read about the musket Wars what does that divide and conquer and ok I'll keep reading so when the Romans entered Macedonia from the south and defeated King peeresses of Macedon in the Battle of of Python and 168 BC Macedonia was then divided into four republics that were heavily restricted from relations one with another and other Hellenic States a ruthless purge occurred with allegedly anti Roman citizens being denounced by their compatriots and deported in large numbers so they they conquered Macedonia and then they divided it this is divide and conquer and then during the the Gallic Wars Julius Caesar was able to use a divide and rule strategy to easily defeat the militarily strong Gauls but by the time the Gauls United it was already too late for them divide and conquer and then now he comes into your address let's just jump 2,000 years well more than that from from the time of Julius Caesar and he is used he is you society to break the family unit he has used it to break the family unit just just five minutes now it says Dell we let's go let's go to Ephesians six and for this just read a bit here and in animal closer now it's interesting when you read the book of Ephesians it goes from Ephesians 5 and it speaks about wives and husbands relationship about how they become one flesh this is what the enemy he doesn't want you to be one and all things right and then as soon as it goes down from that now it goes down to children obey your parents this is the family unit and then after it speaks about that then it says and then it speaks about servants and so on and then then it speaks about finally my brethren be strong in the Lord the power of his might and put on the whole armor of God and verse 11 so he's speaking about now the family needs to be one the family needs to be one and then you put on the whole armor of God then you will stand the enemy okay but the power of the whole family unit is the oneness between husband or wife if that is divided that's why that's why it's so important but well actually you see it in the world what what the world has made marriage to be is not what marriage is marriage in the world is just a physical relationship that has some legal backing and you live in the same house as me to create some stability to have children and it is to have stability it is to have children but that's not the but a real a real marriage is when you actually take them to yourself both ways and you give you have to give you a heart to your spouse it's not rocket science you actually have to give yourself to them just like you give yourself to the Lord he's already he's already given himself to you but you have to respond to his giving right so it's the same thing you actually have to give your whole self to your spouse you cannot hold anything back and that's why and that's why you see people who who live together than they get married that's after get married in the trouble starts because it was fine then but when it when they come to that office of husband wife coming together then there's a trouble because they haven't United themselves with each other amen but now it's important we you have to make sure you say well I don't it's not that way it should be that way it should be that way in in the marriage union where you can first you have to forgive the past and you have to give over the right of holding it against them amen second you have to not only that but then you're going to be willing to say this person that I've United myself to I'm going to take them that's like they you know I know there's children here but you know the marriage union went to become one and the act it's not just a physical thing it's a spiritual thing it is you know spiritually give yourself and then actually spiritually take that person to yourself it's not just a physical act amen and that's why maybe beforehand before you got married it was it was fine but then afterwards is something wrong there has to be a oneness between husband and wife and the word has promised it in the state you say I don't know if we can obtain two that the word has promised it and so you got to really look into the scripture and say well what is really marriage I'm going to close on this justice or what is really mad because what marriage is painted out there is not marriage all that is is a ceremony or maybe an exchanging of rings and maybe some you know at a honeymoon and whatever more and now we live in the same house that's not real marriage we have some musicians to come I'm just gonna continue this next Sunday I don't want to be too long as I got too much I feel I got too much how am i fall but I want you to go think about these things because you say well how do we how do we keep the world out you may not this you can't stop it trying to get in but I tell you if you if you're one with your spouse that there's a oneness in this layers of protection amen and if the word is preeminent then then there's another layer of protection and it's a child's duty now we should we should live in such a way that we do not provoke as it says in the scripture do not provoke your your fathers do not provoke your children to anger at least they'd be discourages this is Colossians 3 and 21 so it says children obey your parents and all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord and father's provoke not your children to anger at least they be discouraged so we should live a life we should live a life that that when we when we expect our children to obey us that it doesn't actually make them angry we should live a life that makes it easy for them to obey us I mean we shouldn't say take this toothbrush now this is a ridiculous example but that's how some people are they they put the bar way too high for their children you know slark if I seem to endless or Lilia here's these toothbrushes you have to go to the store and buy the paint I want you to paint in the ceiling before tonight and then I'll give you yeah you're gonna get her you're gonna get in a lot of trouble if you don't do it it's impossible for them and they've become discouraged we can't do the standards and they'd probably cry and all these things they don't know how to express I can't do this and you know I know that's a ridiculous example that's how sometimes we you know we sit there by way too high amen we should live in such a way and speak to them in such a way that it's not because if they get this if they become angry they get frustrated and they become discouraged in the Lord because if they can obey us how can they obey God amen we'll pick it up next time now let's sing we have I tell you you say well I don't know what you're talking about today there is an anointing present God is present to unite yourself you with your spouse and to keep the devil out of your home amen you say well I don't know if it can be done the Bible says it can be done two shall become one flesh hallelujah and if it's a promise I'd say Lord of it that's my promise I wanted I want to see it live hallelujah Amen let's dance show they just sing let's just sing number 72 and Christ alone my hope is found don't let the devil divide and conquer your life and Christ alone my
