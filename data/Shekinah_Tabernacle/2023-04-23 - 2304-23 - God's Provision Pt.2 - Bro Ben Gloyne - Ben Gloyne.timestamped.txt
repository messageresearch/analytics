[8:51] welcome to the house of God this morning
[8:54] it's good to be here
[8:55] and
[8:57] um
[8:58] what are we musicians what were we told
[9:01] on Wednesday
[9:02] priests amen and our priestesses was
[9:06] that a right were we allowed to say that
[9:07] I guess so
[9:09] Brother Andy Prince an awesome message
[9:11] on Sunday uh Wednesday and it was
[9:14] about war you know getting in an
[9:16] atmosphere of war and and it's so true
[9:18] when you start to read the scriptures
[9:20] that
[9:21] anytime the Israelites would win a
[9:23] battle it's because they
[9:24] it was more than just they went out
[9:26] there with a sword and they had skills
[9:27] and they could try and attack the enemy
[9:29] and have strategy
[9:31] that wasn't what caused them to win the
[9:33] battle it was that the Lord told him
[9:35] they were going to win and they they
[9:36] they encouraged themselves in the law
[9:38] they went forth with singing and praise
[9:40] and there was an atmosphere and that's
[9:43] what made them win not this girl yeah
[9:45] although they had to go out and fight
[9:47] but it was a different atmosphere that
[9:48] they fought in you know we there's a
[9:50] natural way you can try and approach
[9:51] your Christian walk
[9:53] but you know that's that's not that's
[9:56] just uh I hope this works I think this
[9:58] will work a positive thinking what
[9:59] sometimes does work now and then because
[10:01] there is a there is
[10:04] truth and the word of God that anyone
[10:06] anyone by Faith Can can attain that that
[10:09] promise right but but we don't want that
[10:11] we want to get in the atmosphere of the
[10:14] spirit of God and approach things by
[10:15] faith and bear that atmosphere so our
[10:18] job here this morning is to uh what's
[10:20] the music to get us in the atmosphere
[10:22] that we're ready for war amen and we're
[10:25] going to overcome every enemy by faith
[10:27] that that tries to come upon us so let's
[10:29] um let's stand this morning and let's
[10:31] invite the Lord to be here and sing some
[10:33] songs of praise and worship this morning
[10:34] heavenly father it's a great a great
[10:37] thing to
[10:39] have the opportunity to be here this
[10:41] morning Lord to be gathered to be able
[10:43] to worship and praise you for all that
[10:45] you've done in our life our lives Lord
[10:46] and and thank you Lord that we're all
[10:49] here by your Divine Purpose Lord that
[10:51] nothing is an accident Lord you're
[10:53] you're too great for all that you're too
[10:55] great for there just to be random
[10:56] chances Lord but you're the almighty God
[10:59] that knows each time a flea would bat
[11:02] its eye Lord that that your Divine
[11:04] Purpose has called each one of us here
[11:05] this morning and we we come here
[11:07] rejoicing and thanking you for that Lord
[11:09] and we desire that you would meet with
[11:10] us in a powerful way Lord may may every
[11:13] heart here be changed this morning Lord

[11:17] renewed in the Holy ghostly bless the

[12:02] way
[12:03] [Music]
[12:11] we'll do the other songs
[12:17] [Music]
[12:19] hey rock song bro
[12:22] hallelujah praise the Lord today I know
[12:26] I'm free please

[12:37] [Music]
[13:01] Glory
[13:02] Glory Hallelujah
[13:05] praise the Lord today I know I'm free
[13:08] please
[13:14] [Music]
[13:22] [Music]
[13:42] Glory Glory hallelujah praise the Lord
[13:48] today I know I'm free
[13:50] [Music]

[14:28] praise the Lord today I know I'm free
[14:32] please
[14:35] [Music]
[14:57] please
[15:00] [Music]
[15:05] [Applause]
[15:07] amen you free this morning oh yeah just
[15:10] confess it that's why singing is so
[15:13] important because we confess these
[15:15] things even if we don't feel like it we
[15:17] just confess it
[15:19] and that's what makes a difference you
[15:21] know that the the the Bible says that
[15:24] the Lord inhabits the Praises of his
[15:25] people amen so if we express the
[15:27] positive word of God that gets inhabited
[15:30] by the spirit of God conversely if you
[15:32] start professing negative things
[15:34] that came from demons from Spirits
[15:38] because that's all that comes from then
[15:39] you'll find that spirit will come on you
[15:41] because that's what you're confessing
[15:42] yeah right so so even if you feel a
[15:44] certain way just confess the other way
[15:46] and you'll find that actually the
[15:47] atmosphere starts to change and you
[15:48] start to then get in the atmosphere of
[15:50] praise and worship amen oh fill my way

[45:59] seats this morning so I want to take a
[46:01] bit of a part two from uh from last
[46:04] Sunday we're speaking about God's
[46:05] provision and um
[46:07] and then so we so we looked at last
[46:10] Sunday how the enemy is coming like a
[46:12] flood hell's opened itself upon the
[46:13] Earth but then when the enemy comes in
[46:15] like a flood the Lord raises a standard
[46:17] against him and we know that standard is
[46:19] the anointed word in a people amen so
[46:21] you become actually the standard God
[46:23] racist amen by the power of his blood
[46:25] amen but we want to just look at this
[46:27] yeah yeah it really stood out to me it
[46:29] says and you know you know the you know
[46:30] the Redeemer shall come to Zion now we
[46:32] know that Zion represents the bride of
[46:34] Christ but you know you think about
[46:36] something's got to happen when a king
[46:37] comes into a city I mean something's got
[46:40] to happen when the Redeemer comes now we
[46:42] know that on an age level this is the
[46:44] rapture and everything that's going on
[46:45] in this time but we know on an
[46:47] individual level this is when the king
[46:49] takes up residence in your heart when
[46:51] the Holy Ghost comes in and makes makes
[46:53] your heart his throne amen that's when
[46:55] the Redeemer comes to Zion amen
[46:57] individually so we want to talk about
[47:00] how the how the how the everything God
[47:02] has promised in his word is here right
[47:04] now all power amen all all his promises
[47:07] is everything is here right now for the
[47:10] believer amen we're not looking for
[47:11] we're not looking for uh it to come in
[47:14] the future it's here right now and
[47:16] that's my sermon now we can go home amen
[47:18] that's basically where I'm going in case
[47:20] you're wondering amen that everything we
[47:22] have need of for this Earthly Journey
[47:24] amen for all victories amen for for for
[47:27] the defeat of every enemy in our life
[47:29] it's all here right now All That Heaven
[47:31] is a is upon the Earth right now amen
[47:34] we're not living in a past age where
[47:35] they just had a partial restoration of
[47:37] Truth like the Lutheran H there was a
[47:39] bit of God there but not all of God was
[47:40] there I mean he was restoring but we've
[47:43] come down into this bright age where God
[47:45] has fully restored himself into a people
[47:48] again we have been restored rather amen
[47:50] that we're not looking for more because
[47:52] you know because God has sent his final
[47:54] Messenger to the Earth right there's not
[47:56] an eighth Church age messenger there's
[47:57] no eighth Church age there's just seven
[47:59] and the seventh has come he is he has
[48:01] released the word and there's a people
[48:03] upon the Earth that have received the
[48:05] word and now God is making him the Lord
[48:07] live in those people's lives amen amen
[48:10] so we're in the so when the king tags
[48:11] have residence I'm in Everything Changes
[48:13] in a place
[48:14] old fussing goes fighting ghosts malice
[48:18] goes Strife goes Pride goes insecurities
[48:21] get conquered sin gets conquered
[48:24] everything gets taken subject by the
[48:26] king in the city amen so so I'm so
[48:28] thankful by the baptism of the Holy
[48:30] Ghost amen the king takes up residence
[48:32] amen hallelujah amen so you know I was
[48:36] thinking I was walking through
[48:36] whitcoulls sometime this week and um you
[48:39] know a phrase came to mind you know when
[48:40] are people find their way
[48:42] because unfortunately this world has
[48:44] Humanity has lost their way you know
[48:46] everyone is right in their own eyes you
[48:48] know everyone everyone thinks they've
[48:50] got it all taken care of and life is all
[48:52] sorted out and you know but but you know
[48:55] sadly people have lost their way
[48:57] but but there's the people upon the
[48:59] Earth that have found their way
[49:00] you know it's not you know because we
[49:02] got to look at now people will throw
[49:04] always into the future of a restoration
[49:06] of a people of all power and authority
[49:09] is being placed in those people's hands
[49:10] and you know you know but but we live in
[49:13] that day you know you know there Comes a
[49:15] Day when people you know when that day
[49:17] becomes today you know it's like we
[49:19] could speak of Christmas or maybe the
[49:21] next maybe our camp are going to have in
[49:23] October you know we'll say now that day
[49:25] we're going to have camp and that that's
[49:26] going to happen in the future but there
[49:27] comes a day when you drive into Forest
[49:29] Lakes and can't begin right so it's like
[49:32] the promises of God everything he has
[49:33] opened in this day it's not for a future
[49:35] time it's for now yes amen so you know
[49:38] brother man would speak in the you know
[49:40] this is this is the opposite of when
[49:41] people find their way when people can't
[49:43] find their way and he speaks about
[49:44] tourists they wander off the road and
[49:46] get into a desert to to pick some
[49:48] flowers then all all of it looks alike
[49:50] and they can't find their way back it
[49:52] says they you know and and before they
[49:54] die they go and see mirages they run to
[49:56] it jump into it they're throwing and
[49:58] they think they're throwing water on
[49:59] them but actually they're strong hot
[50:01] sand on their head and and and and and a
[50:03] long time before death great vultures
[50:05] come and you know but you know so so
[50:07] that's the opposite of people can't find
[50:08] their way but what about you know are
[50:10] people who find their way because we're
[50:11] not tourists right we're not here to
[50:14] pick up souvenirs you know we are the
[50:15] people of the Living God this morning
[50:17] amen so we're not tourists who can't
[50:19] find their way back no but God has
[50:21] brought us back into the right way
[50:23] Hallelujah so you know so I'm not I
[50:26] believe I'm not looking at a people who
[50:27] who have lost their way or haven't found
[50:30] the way I believe I'm looking at people
[50:32] who have found the way God has put them
[50:34] on the right path and if you're not on
[50:35] the right path this morning I pray God
[50:37] puts you on the right path where because
[50:38] the wrong path is is everything we want
[50:41] to do where it's our desires our needs
[50:43] me me me before the word of God that's
[50:45] the wrong way right for the right but
[50:47] but the right way is not my will but thy
[50:49] will be done Lord hey man so now now the
[50:52] Lord Jesus has has turned the people
[50:55] back the original faith of the fathers
[50:56] now this may all be me for very
[50:58] fundamental but I trust it means more to
[51:00] you today I mean because you'd say in
[51:02] Malachi 4 they'd send Elijah the prophet
[51:04] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[51:05] Lord and he shall turn the heart to the
[51:07] fathers to the children the hearts of
[51:08] the children to their fathers at least I
[51:10] come and smite the Earth's Earth with a
[51:12] curse now we understand from reading in
[51:14] Luke that John the Baptist fulfilled
[51:16] part of the scripture where where the
[51:18] where the angel of God would tell
[51:20] Zechariah I mean I mean yeah uh yeah
[51:22] Zechariah I think it was his um you know
[51:24] John's father that he shall go before
[51:26] him in the spirit and power of Elias to
[51:28] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[51:30] children and the disobedient to the
[51:32] wisdom of the just to make ready Are
[51:33] People prepared for the Lord so notice
[51:35] the ministry of John was to turn the
[51:36] heart to the fathers to the children it
[51:38] wasn't to turn the hearts of the
[51:40] children to the fathers so he would turn
[51:42] the people's hearts from the traditions
[51:44] of the fathers from the law from from
[51:46] all the Customs living to turn their
[51:48] hearts to to receive the Messiah but now
[51:51] we've come back into this day now where
[51:53] where the second part of that scripture
[51:54] would be fulfilled that God would turn
[51:56] the hearts of the children back to the
[51:58] faith of the apostolic fathers amen now
[52:01] we understand that this has already
[52:03] happened
[52:04] right maybe because because if you
[52:06] realize where you're standing then you
[52:08] can then you can operate from where
[52:10] you're standing you know if you think
[52:11] you're in Egypt then you'll be living as
[52:13] an Egyptian right but if you realize
[52:15] you're in the promised land that God has
[52:16] placed you in every Divine promise of
[52:18] God then you'll live according to the
[52:20] place you live that's right I mean so if
[52:21] we realize that all power everything
[52:24] that God is is now poured into the
[52:25] church
[52:26] right now I'm making some announcements
[52:28] this morning see many times you put it
[52:30] off for the future one day the bride
[52:31] will have power one day the bride will
[52:33] overcome one day the devil will be under
[52:34] our feet no that's today that's that
[52:37] that's right now it doesn't matter how
[52:38] you feel about yourself whatever's going
[52:41] on in this it doesn't change what God
[52:43] has done for you amen so if we can stand
[52:45] on what God has done for us then we can
[52:47] stand in that position and overcome
[52:49] praise the Lord amen so you know we
[52:52] should Rejoice this morning amen see see
[52:54] we're not led to a mirage but we are led
[52:56] to the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[52:58] himself amen the Lord Jesus Christ where
[53:00] we can drink and drink and drink and
[53:02] just rejoice
[53:03] Hallelujah now Brother Bear makes a
[53:06] statement and this is from the church
[53:07] age book he says I wonder if we are
[53:09] sufficiently impressed with the word
[53:10] announcements so remember that word is
[53:13] more than ink on paper that's the Living
[53:15] God himself creator of heavens and earth
[53:17] in our midst amen so wonderful being
[53:19] impressed by him enough I'm just
[53:21] changing how you know has it impacted
[53:23] Our Lives enough to realize that the God
[53:25] who made all things is not just with us
[53:28] but he's in us he's not just Emmanuel
[53:30] God With Us but he's God in us amen
[53:32] Christ in you the hope of glory I wonder
[53:34] if this has impressed us enough amen
[53:36] that he's brought us back to the right
[53:38] way Amy Says now let me give you a
[53:40] thought here how do we pray we pray in
[53:42] Jesus name don't we every every prayer
[53:45] is in his name or there isn't any answer
[53:47] yet in first John 5 14 we're told this
[53:50] is the confidence that we have in him
[53:51] that if we ask anything according to his
[53:54] will he heareth us and if we know and if
[53:57] we know that he hears us whatsoever we
[53:59] ask we know that we have the petitions
[54:01] that we desired of him now how now how
[54:04] do we ask what is the will of God
[54:06] there's only one way to know his will
[54:07] and that is by the word of God
[54:09] Lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith
[54:13] and it cometh the past when the law
[54:15] commandeth it not there it is if it
[54:17] isn't in the word you can't have it so
[54:19] we can't so we can't ask unless it's in
[54:21] the word and we can't petition to ask
[54:23] unless it's in his name there it is
[54:25] again Jesus the name is the word the
[54:27] will you can't separate God and the word
[54:29] they are one now then this word is Left
[54:31] Behind on the printed page as a part of
[54:33] him when you accept it by faith into a
[54:36] Spirit-filled life he said that his word
[54:39] was live John 6 63 the B power the verse
[54:42] that is exactly what he is John 14 6 I
[54:45] am the way the truth and the life Romans
[54:47] 8 and 9 the B part says if any man have
[54:49] not the spirit of Christ is none of his
[54:51] there it is he is the spirit and he is
[54:53] life
[54:54] that is exactly what the word is that's
[54:56] exactly what Jesus is he is the word so
[54:59] when a spirit born
[55:00] Spirit-filled man now I trust this next
[55:03] phrase he said he's talking about me so
[55:05] it's not just men it's women too boys
[55:06] and girls so when a spirit born
[55:08] Spirit-filled man or woman boy or girl
[55:11] in faith takes the word into their heart
[55:13] and places it upon their lips why it is
[55:16] the same as deity speaking Every
[55:18] Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[55:21] before that man
[55:22] Hallelujah so Satan can't stand before
[55:25] you he'll try sure he'll try everything
[55:26] he can but he can't stand before you
[55:28] amen he'll be defeated as much as he was
[55:31] in the wilderness by the Lord Jesus as
[55:33] he will be in your life I mean because
[55:35] remember the Lord Jesus he could have
[55:36] used his great power on the enemy and in
[55:38] The Temptations in the desert but he
[55:40] used the word amen to show to us that
[55:42] speaking the word against the enemy has
[55:45] the power in it to defeat his every move
[55:47] I'm so glad the Lord put it that way it
[55:49] means that means even if we feel weak in
[55:51] faith we don't feel like we're much of a
[55:53] Christian we can quote the word in faith
[55:55] believing it has the power in it to
[55:58] defeat the Devil any place anywhere
[55:59] anytime amen so I think if we start
[56:02] quoting the promises of God at the at
[56:04] our enemy many times we'll quote them
[56:06] out God say Lord you said this in your
[56:07] word this is what you've promised for me
[56:09] but it's good to actually quote it back
[56:10] to the enemy too Satan my God made this
[56:13] Covenant with me I'm going to tell you
[56:15] what God the arrangements God has made
[56:16] with me and then I'm going to tell you
[56:18] the arrangements God has made with you
[56:19] not that you need reminding because he
[56:21] told you to to amen and then you'll find
[56:24] he won't hang around you too much
[56:26] [Music]
[56:27] Hallelujah
[56:30] it's good to always speak those things
[56:31] now
[56:32] praise the Lord now so if the church way
[56:34] back there in that third age had only
[56:36] held on to the revelation of the Living
[56:38] Word and the admits the power of God
[56:39] would not have faded as it did in those
[56:42] dark ages and right today when the
[56:44] church returns to the word in faith we
[56:46] can say without a doubt that the glory
[56:48] of God and the wonderful acts of God
[56:50] will be in her midst again now many
[56:52] people will say well yes when the church
[56:54] returns to the word in faith one day
[56:56] that's going to happen and then God's
[56:57] Gonna pour us Spirit out and we're going
[56:59] to have an incredible time no no the
[57:01] bride has returned we have returned to
[57:04] the word in faith amen we're not
[57:06] returning if you have the baptism of the
[57:07] Holy Ghost this morning you have
[57:09] returned to the word and Faith you have
[57:11] arrived amen that the power of God the
[57:13] wonderful acts of God will be in your
[57:15] midst again amen if you have received
[57:17] the Holy Ghost this is see let's not put
[57:19] the promise off in the future one day
[57:22] when the squeeze comes down no no the
[57:23] squeeze is squeezing right the power of
[57:26] the third pull is here right now amen
[57:28] yeah I know Christine will fill in all
[57:30] the details you can ask her later but at
[57:32] our Camp God came down and spoke through
[57:35] her a couple of times to two different
[57:36] people one to us one to his one to was
[57:39] Elizabeth and one and and wonder was was
[57:41] the Sharon here and God spoke
[57:43] and Christine was marbling about this
[57:45] and the Lord said to her this is the
[57:47] third pull and it will it will become
[57:50] more and more
[57:51] it's just more of what we already have
[57:53] manifesting that's where the third pull
[57:54] is I mean it's just a greater measure of
[57:57] what we already have
[57:58] amen yeah I try y'all just give a con
[58:01] you go ask her the testimonies right but
[58:03] God said it's here yes right it's not
[58:06] one day it's here the power of the
[58:08] spoken word is here well one day when
[58:11] the bride gets in her position here we
[58:13] are amen we've lined up with the word of
[58:16] God our hearts all they want is him to
[58:18] live amen we don't want malice we don't
[58:20] want Strife we don't want hatred we
[58:22] don't want Envy we don't want jealousy
[58:24] we don't want anything that's not of God
[58:25] in our lives we just want him to live I
[58:27] mean we just want to have pure heart
[58:29] which is a Simplicity of just nothing
[58:30] between my soul and my savior he is
[58:33] everything to me I want to live for him
[58:35] I want to praise him I want to be a
[58:37] living worship Hallelujah that's what my
[58:39] life should be amen because that's what
[58:42] we want isn't it amen and what does that
[58:44] do that's actually perfect love on
[58:46] display amen if perfect lovers on
[58:48] display then God can take out take our
[58:51] lives and speak through it amen and
[58:53] creation can happen anything can happen
[58:55] amen it's exactly the same as God
[58:57] standing there I don't know how exactly
[58:59] how he still but he said let there be
[59:00] sun moon and stars and and God created
[59:03] something out of nothing
[59:05] Hallelujah and God can that same one
[59:07] because remember we don't serve a Lesser
[59:09] God you know it was amazing when I was
[59:11] looking at this you know you know I you
[59:12] know I went on my computer and I and I
[59:14] and I um put you know Isaiah 59 that we
[59:17] just read into my notes and I was
[59:19] reading it and and it said and a
[59:22] redeemer will come to Zion
[59:24] although something's not quite right
[59:25] here this doesn't sound right to me and
[59:27] then it said in the previous verse so
[59:29] they shall fear the name of the Lord
[59:30] from the West and his glory from the
[59:32] rising of the Sun for he will come like
[59:34] a rushing stream at which the wind of
[59:37] the Lord drives I thought hold on what
[59:39] what what version am I reading it's not
[59:41] the King James version it was the
[59:43] English Standard Version because I look
[59:45] at different things but yeah but but
[59:46] when I put that down just that verse 20
[59:48] and a redeemer will come to Zion no no
[59:51] he's not a redeemer he's the Redeemer I
[59:54] mean like we read there in the King
[59:55] James and the Redeemer shall come to
[59:57] Zion he's not a redeemer he is the king
[1:00:00] of kings and Lord of lords he is the
[1:00:02] Redeemer he is the Alpha and Omega he is
[1:00:04] the all sufficient one he's the
[1:00:06] all-powerful one so when when we realize
[1:00:08] when the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[1:00:10] Ghost is not a Lesser God he's not a
[1:00:12] second person of a godhead you know he's
[1:00:14] not lit no he is the god the Creator
[1:00:17] himself the Lord Of Glory steps in and
[1:00:20] dwells in you hello that's why when when
[1:00:23] you know you feel lit you're in faith
[1:00:25] you take the word of God speak it across
[1:00:27] your lips it's the same as deity
[1:00:28] speaking amen irrespective of how you
[1:00:31] feel you can feel as dead as a post but
[1:00:33] faith is not a feeling amen faith is a
[1:00:36] faith it's a revelation this word is
[1:00:37] true amen amen God is able to perform
[1:00:39] this more than Abel amen we can take any
[1:00:42] promise of God and quote it to God and
[1:00:44] believe that God will answer in his good
[1:00:47] time according to his good pleasure amen
[1:00:49] because many times we pray something we
[1:00:51] don't see an answer we begin to doubt
[1:00:53] our prayer you've got to have confidence
[1:00:54] in what you've prayed right like God
[1:00:57] believed his own word and here we are
[1:00:59] living because he believed his own word
[1:01:01] when he said that there'll be sun moon
[1:01:02] and stars amen so when you pray you've
[1:01:04] got to believe God here's my prayer
[1:01:06] because of his blood there's no Chasm
[1:01:08] between me and God anymore I'm a
[1:01:10] redeemed son or daughter of God on the
[1:01:12] other side of the chasm and perfect
[1:01:13] fellowship with God hallelujah and he
[1:01:15] hears my prince
[1:01:17] hallelujah amen so in my opinion the
[1:01:20] bride is not returning to the word and
[1:01:22] Faith she has returned amen we have
[1:01:24] arrived amen we're not looking for
[1:01:26] another something in the future no it's
[1:01:29] right now remember the third pull is
[1:01:30] here it's been identified Among Us
[1:01:33] right not on the other side of the world
[1:01:34] so it's been identified in this place
[1:01:36] amen amen and it will get greater and
[1:01:39] greater I believe that amen I believe
[1:01:42] God's creative power will speak in a
[1:01:44] greater measure Hallelujah because this
[1:01:46] is this is where we're living see see
[1:01:48] God see what I love about God is he is
[1:01:51] he loves to show the power of his
[1:01:53] salvation amen he loves to show the
[1:01:55] power of his blood amen when he died and
[1:01:58] he said it is finished Amen in his mind
[1:02:00] he knew it's done
[1:02:02] I have bridged the Gulf I have released
[1:02:05] my Holy Ghost now upon the earth I have
[1:02:08] I have released the power the power that
[1:02:10] will cleanse a person's heart my Fallen
[1:02:13] children will no longer be fallen
[1:02:14] anymore thou will be redeemed they will
[1:02:16] be made in my image amen they'll be
[1:02:18] perfect Fellowship between me and them
[1:02:20] like with Mia I have with Adam and Eve
[1:02:22] amen there'll be nothing between me and
[1:02:24] them though they're in Fallen bodies
[1:02:26] they will walk with me and overcome in
[1:02:28] Fallen bodies where Adam and Eve were in
[1:02:31] perfect bodies but they fell
[1:02:32] hey man that's the power of His
[1:02:34] Redemption Hallelujah that we can walk
[1:02:36] with our frailties our Humanity our
[1:02:38] problems all these things you look at
[1:02:39] the man in the mirror I do I say I don't
[1:02:42] like this person I see I get frustrated
[1:02:44] with them I get I get anointed as
[1:02:46] personality and all these different
[1:02:48] things but yet God said no I will show
[1:02:50] you my victory in your life amen
[1:02:52] irrespective of of of this guy I will
[1:02:55] show the power of the blood amen and
[1:02:57] that is what this message has come to do
[1:02:59] to show the power of the blood it's more
[1:03:01] than just being forgiven amen no it's
[1:03:03] being justified as Brother David Tyler
[1:03:04] preached there any you know you know
[1:03:06] Easter time that we're not just a pardon
[1:03:08] people no we never did it in the first
[1:03:10] place Hallelujah but there's a power on
[1:03:13] that amen
[1:03:14] that is incredibly wonderful if I can
[1:03:17] just find the quote of it here God and
[1:03:19] simplicity if you don't mind the mind
[1:03:21] the reading he says now
[1:03:22] it says but God sent down from heaven a
[1:03:24] bleach for sin it was the blood of his
[1:03:27] own son now when our confession drops
[1:03:29] into God's bleach try and find it again
[1:03:31] the coloring of sin goes back through
[1:03:33] the mediators and down through the time
[1:03:35] until it hits the accuser Satan lays on
[1:03:37] him till the day of judgment what
[1:03:39] happens to the Sun
[1:03:40] so what happens to you and I because
[1:03:42] that's all very wonderful that that
[1:03:43] happens to the devil
[1:03:46] and the church said amen
[1:03:49] wow okay
[1:03:51] we need to stand up we need to sing a
[1:03:53] song
[1:03:54] hey man stand okay so what happens to
[1:03:56] the sun he becomes infer and perfect
[1:03:59] fellowship with the father again
[1:04:01] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:04:03] with no remembrance of sin against him
[1:04:05] no more there's no more stain of bleach
[1:04:08] can be seen anywhere he's free
[1:04:09] Hallelujah just as that Clorox or that
[1:04:12] ink can never be Inked no more because
[1:04:14] it broke up and was sent back again and
[1:04:16] when confessed Sinners confessed and
[1:04:19] dipped a man or woman that's been dipped
[1:04:21] into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills
[1:04:23] all symptoms
[1:04:24] it kills all symptoms of sin it kills
[1:04:27] all symptoms of unbelief malice Pride
[1:04:30] Strife whatever it be holding grudges
[1:04:33] unforgiveness business whatever it is it
[1:04:35] kills all symptoms
[1:04:37] praise the Lord
[1:04:39] Hallelujah and every molecule of sun
[1:04:41] goes back to the devil and laid on him
[1:04:43] to the day of judgment where his eternal
[1:04:45] destination will be thrown into a lake
[1:04:46] of fire and the chasm is bridged and
[1:04:49] never to come in remembrance no more and
[1:04:51] a man's down stands Justified as a Son
[1:04:54] of God Simplicity now he says Moses
[1:04:57] under the blood of bulls and goats with
[1:04:58] with his confession in the word of God
[1:05:00] and God could take that simple man and
[1:05:03] put his words in his mouth and he proved
[1:05:05] that he was Jehovah's servant for he
[1:05:07] could walk out there and Jehovah spoke
[1:05:09] to him by vision and he walked out
[1:05:11] stretched out his hands towards the east
[1:05:12] and now remember God had spoke to him
[1:05:14] it's God's thought God uses man God
[1:05:17] spoke to him that's right he said go
[1:05:19] stretch stretch that rod in your hand
[1:05:21] towards the east and say flies Moses
[1:05:24] under the blood of that goat sheep
[1:05:26] walked out there and took that stick
[1:05:27] reached towards the east thus saith the
[1:05:30] Lord let there be flies never heard a
[1:05:31] fly walked on back it's already spoke
[1:05:34] it's a thought now it spoke it's
[1:05:36] expressed it's the word of God then it
[1:05:38] come into a human's lips and a simple
[1:05:40] man under the blood a bull a bull or a
[1:05:43] goat
[1:05:44] first thing you know a green fly began
[1:05:46] to fly around next thing you know they
[1:05:48] were five pounds per yard what was it it
[1:05:50] was the word of God spoken through Moses
[1:05:52] the Creator because under the blood he
[1:05:54] was standing in the prince of God in his
[1:05:56] own words wasn't his word he says if ye
[1:05:59] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:06:01] then ask what you will and it shall be
[1:06:02] given to you where is the church
[1:06:04] standing at
[1:06:05] Amen Let There Be frogs and there wasn't
[1:06:07] a frog in the country in an hour's time
[1:06:09] they were they were 10 foot deep in
[1:06:12] places what was it it was God the
[1:06:13] Creator hiding himself and a simple man
[1:06:15] now I want to ask you something of the
[1:06:17] blood or a bull or a goat can be used
[1:06:19] for a bleach that could only cover could
[1:06:22] put a man in a position to speak the
[1:06:24] creative word of God and bring flies
[1:06:26] into existence why would you stumble at
[1:06:28] The Bleach of Jesus Christ but there
[1:06:30] would speak a squirrel or something into
[1:06:31] existence I mean so if a man under the
[1:06:34] blood of bull you just think about it
[1:06:35] Moses still had a fall of nature he was
[1:06:38] still his his sins were just covered
[1:06:40] there was not a power and a blood or a
[1:06:41] bull or goat to change his nature like
[1:06:44] the blood of Jesus Christ changes ours
[1:06:46] but yet he was walking according to the
[1:06:48] word of God he was answered to prophecy
[1:06:51] and he walked into Egypt he said let my
[1:06:54] people go and whatever came out of his
[1:06:56] mouth wasn't him speaking but it was God
[1:06:58] speaking that God would so poor his
[1:07:00] wrath out upon the gods of the Egyptians
[1:07:02] and prove his power to bring a total
[1:07:05] Deliverance to the people of Israel now
[1:07:07] God can do that under the blood of bulls
[1:07:09] and goats friends how much more the
[1:07:11] Bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of
[1:07:13] Jesus Christ amen it doesn't just cover
[1:07:15] our sin it changes our nature it takes
[1:07:17] our sins away amen how much more people
[1:07:19] right now where is the church standing
[1:07:21] at I mean where are we standing at right
[1:07:23] now what condition has God put us in see
[1:07:26] it's not us putting ourselves in that
[1:07:27] condition saying I'm going to be sinless
[1:07:29] I'm going to be perfect no it's God's
[1:07:31] predestination amen his predestinated
[1:07:34] grace to you has called you to his side
[1:07:36] change your nature washed all your sins
[1:07:39] away amen that you it's the same as he
[1:07:42] speaking the same as you speaking I mean
[1:07:44] when God speaks and then you speak the
[1:07:46] same thing what it's like him speaking
[1:07:48] what condition ought to we to be at amen
[1:07:51] that's your takeaway all worry it's your
[1:07:54] takeaway all fair you say well God
[1:07:56] hasn't done much in my life what do you
[1:07:58] believe the word of God Amen do you
[1:08:00] believe this message says God turned
[1:08:01] your heart back to the faith of the
[1:08:03] fathers if you believe the word he has
[1:08:06] God's already done something to you say
[1:08:07] well I need a supernatural testimony do
[1:08:09] you have faith in the full word of God
[1:08:12] it's a supernatural thing amen that it's
[1:08:14] not a tradition it's not what I was just
[1:08:16] raised in church my father mother
[1:08:18] believed this no but he becomes your God
[1:08:20] Amen he speaks to your heart you want to
[1:08:22] read his word amen you like to pray you
[1:08:25] enjoy his presence amen that it's no
[1:08:27] longer you're not programmed to be this
[1:08:29] way by man it's actually God getting a
[1:08:31] hold of your life and out of your free
[1:08:33] will you give your heart to him
[1:08:35] amen that is a supernatural work of God
[1:08:38] aiming to turn someone's heart from
[1:08:40] unbelief to Faith it actually caught it
[1:08:43] it's actually caused because the devil's
[1:08:45] dethroned and God comes in
[1:08:48] where is the church standing at I mean
[1:08:50] what condition are we in Hallelujah said
[1:08:53] no that's why I say
[1:08:54] we've arrived we're here
[1:08:57] we're not looking oh one day this will
[1:08:59] happen wow God's Gonna restore his word
[1:09:01] he's going to restore our people back no
[1:09:03] we're here we're here now this is the
[1:09:06] condition we're in right now doesn't
[1:09:08] matter how you feel doesn't matter what
[1:09:10] you think doesn't matter what you're
[1:09:12] going through what is your heart of
[1:09:14] hearts tell you I believe
[1:09:16] I believe something in me says yes Lord
[1:09:18] your word is true you're more than able
[1:09:20] to perform it I don't know how you're
[1:09:22] going to do it the Deep that's his
[1:09:24] problem God takes care of the details
[1:09:26] you just take the word in faith don't
[1:09:28] look at circumstances don't look at
[1:09:30] problems just take him at his word and
[1:09:32] watch God come
[1:09:34] Hallelujah so so we you think about if
[1:09:37] if Moses I just want to repeat this now
[1:09:39] because it really strikes me if Moses
[1:09:40] could could use the creative power of
[1:09:43] God well God could use him to do all
[1:09:45] those things split the Red Sea get water
[1:09:48] from the rock do incredible things how
[1:09:50] much more you and I how much more you
[1:09:53] and I remember Israel Israel wasn't all
[1:09:55] one heart one mind one Accord coming
[1:09:57] with Moses
[1:09:58] they weren't all praise God and you know
[1:10:01] they come to um you know the bitter
[1:10:03] Waters they didn't say praise the Lord
[1:10:04] God's Gonna Change the water we're gonna
[1:10:06] have sweet water to drink and and then
[1:10:07] they're hungry praise God God's Jehovah
[1:10:09] Jireh no they were murmuring and
[1:10:12] complaining but as long as Moses walked
[1:10:14] with God and he didn't walk with his
[1:10:16] temper he didn't walk with the fussing
[1:10:18] of the people he didn't he wasn't
[1:10:20] consumed by those things then God could
[1:10:22] use him to meet the people's needs now
[1:10:25] we're going to look at our families hey
[1:10:27] we're not all one heart one mind one
[1:10:28] Accord
[1:10:30] amen right but God has placed you in a
[1:10:33] position right that you can be a breach
[1:10:36] you can stand in the gap for your family
[1:10:38] amen and you can walk with God that's
[1:10:40] why we should just love the Lord
[1:10:42] just love him in every season of your
[1:10:44] life you may be in the darkest Siberian
[1:10:47] winter of your life
[1:10:48] all right just just push your hands
[1:10:50] through the snow and say hallelujah amen
[1:10:53] you may be in the summertime just praise
[1:10:55] God just love him let him take control
[1:10:59] of your life like like brother Isaac and
[1:11:01] and Ed and me we're talking about love
[1:11:03] you know you know how how important love
[1:11:06] is in a in a church and we should always
[1:11:09] fight for the love of God that that the
[1:11:12] devil has nowhere to move you know we
[1:11:14] should have a millennial condition right
[1:11:16] now in the church because in the
[1:11:18] Millennium the devil's bound right he
[1:11:19] has no one to work through amen so it
[1:11:21] should be the same thing in in any
[1:11:23] church or any family there should be
[1:11:25] such a condition the devil just can't
[1:11:27] get in amen amen and then if he gets in
[1:11:30] there's not another spirit for him to
[1:11:32] cry to help with to get strength you
[1:11:33] know like brother Brown would preach and
[1:11:35] you'll be calling out someone's got a
[1:11:37] cancer or trouble I'm not pointing
[1:11:38] anyone in particular you know so don't
[1:11:39] work you know but but then but then it's
[1:11:41] here dark streak it's another Spirit was
[1:11:43] crying out for help the other those
[1:11:45] demons trying to reinforcing themselves
[1:11:47] see it should be and the church had the
[1:11:49] enemy because the enemy was try and come
[1:11:51] in we're humans right we're human we're
[1:11:53] not we're not Angels right okay we've
[1:11:56] got a couple of humans here praise the
[1:11:58] Lord hallelujah
[1:12:00] right but you see so the devil the devil
[1:12:03] will try and come in but what do we do
[1:12:04] with him when he comes right I mean do
[1:12:06] we take his sides and sympathize with
[1:12:08] him and agree with them and just you
[1:12:09] know no or do we do we do we live in
[1:12:12] such a way that the enemy may come
[1:12:14] against us but he's just got to bounce
[1:12:15] off
[1:12:16] and not to someone else but back to Hell
[1:12:18] from whence he came from amen where the
[1:12:20] enemy actually has no he just can't get
[1:12:22] in
[1:12:23] yeah he just can't he just can't get a
[1:12:25] toe hold in anyone's life we can live
[1:12:27] like that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:29] causes us to live like that if we stay
[1:12:31] surrendered to the Lord hallelujah amen
[1:12:33] he's more than able to do it I mean so
[1:12:35] Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at
[1:12:37] people that can live like that yes
[1:12:38] that's why would you always just let the
[1:12:40] love of God rule
[1:12:42] above all things to walk in love as as
[1:12:44] the Apostle Paul said to the Ephesians
[1:12:47] amen so now we can the power of the
[1:12:50] third pool is here
[1:12:52] hallelujah it's here right this morning
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:55] amen amen we have returned to the word
[1:12:57] in faith I'm just repeating a few
[1:12:59] phrases that I've read we have returned
[1:13:01] to the word and Faith amen we have
[1:13:02] arrived we have came back Hallelujah
[1:13:06] amen so now many people will will think
[1:13:09] well this is in the future
[1:13:11] but it's right now we're going to
[1:13:12] realize the season that we're living in
[1:13:14] you know Israel's Journey from from
[1:13:17] Egypt into the promised land really
[1:13:19] parallels this day we live in
[1:13:22] you know after brother Brown left if you
[1:13:24] look at church history there's a lot of
[1:13:25] fussing and fighting among Believers
[1:13:27] Church splits trouble it was like Israel
[1:13:28] in the wilderness you know sure God was
[1:13:30] there God was doing Miracles and things
[1:13:32] but there was fussing you know false
[1:13:35] doctrines rose up trouble all these
[1:13:36] things going on but yet there came a
[1:13:39] time after that where where Israel went
[1:13:41] into the Promised Land
[1:13:43] and possessed everything that God gave
[1:13:46] them
[1:13:46] Hallelujah and it's the same thing today
[1:13:49] after the prophet left fussing fighting
[1:13:51] trouble those 40 Years of wilderness
[1:13:52] sure God was there but he was mainly
[1:13:55] fighting and fussing in church splits
[1:13:57] but then when you look back at around
[1:14:00] 2005 which was 40 years from when uh you
[1:14:02] know after brother Brown went off the
[1:14:04] scene there was a change of season yep
[1:14:06] amen it was like we're coming out of
[1:14:08] winter into Springtime amen where it's
[1:14:10] no longer we're no longer in the
[1:14:12] wilderness amen but the bride is crossed
[1:14:14] Jordan and Is possessing every promise
[1:14:16] that belongs to us you know I was
[1:14:18] talking to someone this week and I told
[1:14:20] them about this and I was saying about
[1:14:21] you know you know my wife you know you
[1:14:24] know we know Christine was raised in
[1:14:25] church and and she said that for the
[1:14:28] first 20 years of her life the only
[1:14:30] person she saw received the Holy Ghost
[1:14:32] was herself
[1:14:34] is that me
[1:14:37] amen but you see but now she's seen many
[1:14:41] now we've seen many people come to the
[1:14:43] Lord we've seen many people filled with
[1:14:45] the Holy Ghost many people are going to
[1:14:46] show just use that one
[1:14:48] what's here this thing
[1:14:53] are we good I turned it righty tighty
[1:14:56] lefty Loosey it's not a gas connection
[1:14:57] good all right amen but you see
[1:15:01] but you see now there was a season where
[1:15:04] not much was going on right but now we
[1:15:07] live in a different season I mean now we
[1:15:09] see many people have received the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost amen God moves in great power more
[1:15:13] than he was always there but now it's a
[1:15:15] different season I mean where the bride
[1:15:17] has crossed Jordan and has entered into
[1:15:20] the promised land amen where every
[1:15:22] Divine promise of God Amen is for the
[1:15:25] believer amen we're here to possess
[1:15:26] every Divine promise of God Amen you see
[1:15:29] we but but we're going to realize this
[1:15:31] is where we are
[1:15:33] you know I looked at the quote yesterday
[1:15:36] this one time brother Brown talks about
[1:15:37] ducks and he says you know it's like
[1:15:39] there used to be a time where you know a
[1:15:41] farm would have ducks in their fences
[1:15:43] and then another Farm where they have
[1:15:44] ducks and you know but then but then the
[1:15:46] water comes and actually lifts the Ducks
[1:15:48] above the above the fences Amen to see
[1:15:51] it's just that the blessings of God poor
[1:15:52] enough I mean it'll raise all the
[1:15:54] Believers above all the fences and the
[1:15:56] fussing and the fighting and the and the
[1:15:57] dogma's in trouble and we realized we're
[1:15:59] all believers and that's what's happened
[1:16:01] in this country amen that you know the
[1:16:03] spirit of God's been pouring in more and
[1:16:06] more yeah yeah it used to be before 2005
[1:16:09] around there you know people would just
[1:16:10] hear the honking of other believers
[1:16:11] behind fences and they start you know
[1:16:14] you know they kind of sound like
[1:16:15] Believers but I'm not sure this is fits
[1:16:17] and well those people that that part of
[1:16:19] this but then now it's a different
[1:16:20] season why the water's been poured in
[1:16:22] we've been lifted up above all that
[1:16:24] stuff and we can't even see where the
[1:16:26] fences are and we realize actually we're
[1:16:28] all one body we're all believers I mean
[1:16:30] we're all being Redeemed by the same
[1:16:32] blood Amen to the same Lord Jesus
[1:16:34] purchased our Salvation like anyone else
[1:16:36] hallelujah amen so what's happening now
[1:16:39] the water's risen us above the fences
[1:16:42] now now what's gonna now what's
[1:16:44] happening now there's a swarming going
[1:16:45] on
[1:16:46] there's a swarming going on why there's
[1:16:49] another change in season what is it
[1:16:50] Resurrection season rap shower amen this
[1:16:53] is the season we live in that's why
[1:16:55] there's a swarming going on Amen that
[1:16:57] it's not a library anymore in a church
[1:16:58] but there's a Hallelujah and a praise to
[1:17:00] God God begins to move what's happening
[1:17:02] there's a swarming going on I mean not a
[1:17:05] cold breeze coming upon a pond but a
[1:17:07] warm breeze of the Holy Ghost floating
[1:17:09] through the church amen what is that
[1:17:10] that's a call you're going to come up
[1:17:12] high soon children I mean you're gonna
[1:17:14] leave this world Amen why because we
[1:17:16] live in a different season
[1:17:18] Hallelujah now it must have been amazing
[1:17:20] for the disciples
[1:17:21] they lived through many days where
[1:17:23] prophecy became history Jesus fulfilled
[1:17:26] over 300 prophecies in his ministry
[1:17:29] you know so so there would have been
[1:17:31] many a week where they could have said
[1:17:32] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:34] amen but they had to you know but took
[1:17:37] the grace of God for them to actually
[1:17:38] realize it yeah that's right yeah amen
[1:17:40] so you know you just take one for
[1:17:42] example look for when he goes to the um
[1:17:44] goes to Nazareth he goes to the
[1:17:46] synagogue and he stands up to read and
[1:17:49] then you know it was delivered unto him
[1:17:51] the book of the prophet Isaiah you know
[1:17:53] that was predestinated handing whoever
[1:17:56] gave in the book was anointed to give
[1:17:58] them that scroll and when he had opened
[1:18:01] the book he found the place where it was
[1:18:02] written so he didn't just open and just
[1:18:03] say I'll read this verse it sounds good
[1:18:05] he found his particular verse particular
[1:18:08] scripture and he says the spirit of the
[1:18:10] Lord is upon me because he's anointed me
[1:18:12] to preach the gospel to the poor he hath
[1:18:14] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:18:15] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[1:18:17] the recovering of the sights of the
[1:18:18] blind to sit at Liberty them that are
[1:18:20] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[1:18:22] the Lord and he closed the book and it
[1:18:24] was given again to the minister and he
[1:18:25] sat down and in the eyes of all them are
[1:18:27] in the synagogue were fasted on him and
[1:18:29] he began to say to them this day is this
[1:18:31] scripture fulfilled in your ears so they
[1:18:34] begin to you know you know it was just
[1:18:35] like any other synagogue service but
[1:18:37] Jesus came to synagogue it was Jesus
[1:18:39] custom to go to church we should too
[1:18:41] amen and then so he found that scripture
[1:18:43] he says he says this thing what you see
[1:18:45] in front of you right now is the
[1:18:46] Fulfillment of this prophecy that means
[1:18:49] it was no longer prophecy was becoming
[1:18:51] history but you think about it let's
[1:18:53] just take one of those promises there
[1:18:55] the recovering of the sight to the blind
[1:18:57] now why something to say a prophecy is
[1:18:59] here I mean a prophecy is being
[1:19:01] fulfilled there's nothing for God to
[1:19:02] come in behind them and say yes that's
[1:19:04] true Hallelujah because many people
[1:19:06] claim a lot of things but when God comes
[1:19:08] down and says yes that's a whole
[1:19:10] different story I mean that's why that's
[1:19:11] why the Lord would come and behind the
[1:19:13] prophet messenger meeting after meeting
[1:19:14] night after night and say this is not
[1:19:17] actually him this is not his ideas this
[1:19:18] is my idea that's why I back it up over
[1:19:21] vindicate it should I just change this
[1:19:22] thing let's just get rid of this
[1:19:27] yeah either way
[1:19:31] I think I'm pinned my pin and Pen me
[1:19:34] look at me
[1:19:38] like Mike okay
[1:19:40] spoil for choice
[1:19:43] all right so if we look at this here now
[1:19:45] how many people see see it's when God
[1:19:48] comes down and confirms his word that's
[1:19:51] how we know it's the truth or not
[1:19:53] that ain't all debate that should end
[1:19:55] all all questions right when God comes
[1:19:58] and amens his word so now if we just
[1:20:00] take this one part of this promise here
[1:20:02] because if it's one thing for Jesus to
[1:20:04] to speak it there's another thing for
[1:20:06] for them to actually realize actually
[1:20:08] what he's saying has happened can you I
[1:20:10] don't know if I'm in a shower in a box
[1:20:11] or somewhere amen
[1:20:13] all right just turn this down a bit okay
[1:20:15] so now let's just take one and the
[1:20:17] recovering of the sight to the blind now
[1:20:19] how many blind people did Jesus heal
[1:20:21] during the time of his ministry amen but
[1:20:24] you see see how many blinds see he
[1:20:26] healed many blind to show that the
[1:20:28] prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled now we
[1:20:31] just take one for example take blind
[1:20:33] Bartimaeus remember remember he was
[1:20:35] brother Brown would dramatizes his life
[1:20:37] and say he was a devout man he believed
[1:20:39] in Jehovah God you know he lived there
[1:20:41] in Jericho and you know his mother would
[1:20:43] put him on his knee and begin I mean put
[1:20:45] him on her knee and would tell her tell
[1:20:47] him the great stories of you know Elijah
[1:20:49] and Joshua and Rahab and all those
[1:20:51] stories that happened there in Jericho
[1:20:53] and then she would tell him you know
[1:20:55] that same God is still alive today
[1:20:57] somewhere he still lives but then his
[1:21:00] eyes begin to you know when he's a young
[1:21:01] boy he went blind and then they gave him
[1:21:04] in those days apparently they had
[1:21:05] instead of like a dog to be the you're
[1:21:08] seeing dog they they had lambs and then
[1:21:10] and then Blind by the mass you know he
[1:21:12] got married he had children and and then
[1:21:14] in order to get money he had these two
[1:21:16] turtle doves that would dance over each
[1:21:18] other like a street performer and people
[1:21:19] would give him money but then what would
[1:21:21] happen of course is I mean you know one
[1:21:23] of his children got sick and he went out
[1:21:25] beside the side of the house because the
[1:21:27] doctor said nothing can happen and then
[1:21:28] he promised he said he said Joe great
[1:21:30] Jehovah God I know you're a God of
[1:21:32] Miracles I know you're still a Healer I
[1:21:34] promise I'll give I will give one of
[1:21:36] these turtle doves as a sacrifice and
[1:21:38] let the other one go amen as a yeah you
[1:21:41] know that my daughter will get well and
[1:21:42] and then so so he did that you know when
[1:21:45] he was taking the turtle doves to the
[1:21:46] temple that day no doubt there was
[1:21:48] someone there and you almost said
[1:21:49] Bartimaeus you know you don't have to
[1:21:51] give those doves those ones give you
[1:21:53] income you know you just take one of my
[1:21:55] doves he said no no I didn't but then he
[1:21:57] said to that man he said thank you very
[1:22:00] much but I didn't promise God any Dove I
[1:22:02] promise this one amen and then and then
[1:22:05] his daughter got well and then his wife
[1:22:06] got real sick after that and then he
[1:22:09] went out the side of the house where he
[1:22:10] used to pray he said Jehovah God you
[1:22:12] healed my daughter I promise I'll give
[1:22:14] you the slam I mean that that my wife
[1:22:17] will get well I need her to raise the
[1:22:19] children to be my wife all these things
[1:22:20] and so he took that lamb actually the
[1:22:22] lamb led him to the temple because that
[1:22:24] was his eyes and then so as the lamb was
[1:22:26] leading him to the temple maybe the same
[1:22:27] same man said to him you know butter
[1:22:29] Mass where are you going he says I'm you
[1:22:31] know my wife's not well but I but but I
[1:22:34] believe you know I'm going to give a
[1:22:35] lamb and she's going to get well and
[1:22:37] then to the same man said but but that's
[1:22:39] your eyes you need those eyes to look
[1:22:40] around amen yo you need that lamb take
[1:22:43] this lamb but he said no no I promised
[1:22:45] God this lamb and God will provide me a
[1:22:47] way to look around you know what you
[1:22:49] give God God multiplies in a far greater
[1:22:51] measure amen you know the devil steals
[1:22:53] the youth steals our age steals our time
[1:22:55] but God doesn't steal nothing he
[1:22:57] actually restores far greater than what
[1:22:59] you give him amen because because if we
[1:23:02] give our youth to God God will give us
[1:23:04] Eternal youth Hallelujah if the devil
[1:23:06] steals your youth he doesn't give you
[1:23:08] nothing back you know you know in return
[1:23:10] so then butter Mass gave the lamb and
[1:23:13] then his wife got well now he's a beggar
[1:23:15] there yeah and Jericho and he had warm
[1:23:17] himself brother Brown would say that the
[1:23:19] that the walls of the city the bricks
[1:23:21] would get worn by the Sun and you know
[1:23:22] push himself up against the brickwork to
[1:23:24] warm himself and then he heard a
[1:23:26] commotion go past him that he never
[1:23:27] heard before whether you know you heard
[1:23:29] the shouting some some people were
[1:23:31] crying Hosanna some were saying he's
[1:23:32] Beelzebub some were saying have nothing
[1:23:34] to do with them some you know all these
[1:23:36] kind of things going on and then he
[1:23:38] began to say what's going on because he
[1:23:40] can't see amen so he begins to ask and
[1:23:42] someone comes to him and says this is
[1:23:44] Jesus going by who's Jesus well he
[1:23:48] healed this person he raised Lazarus
[1:23:50] from the grave he calmed the storm he
[1:23:52] fed thousands and thousands of people
[1:23:54] amen he you know he opened the eyes of
[1:23:56] the blind Open the Eyes of the Blind and
[1:23:58] I told that man that God will give me
[1:24:00] back my sight he'll give me eyes to see
[1:24:02] and he began to cry out Jesus thou son
[1:24:05] of David have mercy on me amen and it
[1:24:08] wasn't it wasn't the volume of his cries
[1:24:11] that stopped Jesus it was his faith
[1:24:13] touch the master
[1:24:15] other than Jesus Stood Still and when
[1:24:18] and he opened his eyes amen why because
[1:24:21] when Isaiah was anointed to write the
[1:24:24] prophecy and it said in the recovering
[1:24:26] of the sight to the blind there had to
[1:24:28] be a predestinated person or people that
[1:24:31] would have the faith that that would be
[1:24:33] manifested in their lives amen who was
[1:24:36] that blind Bartimaeus Hallelujah there
[1:24:38] was another man who was blind from birth
[1:24:40] and and as Jesus passed by him he saw a
[1:24:44] man which was born blind from his birth
[1:24:46] and his disciples asked and saying
[1:24:48] master who did Sin this man or his
[1:24:51] parents that he was born blind so in
[1:24:53] other words whose fault is it that he
[1:24:55] that that he's in this state you know
[1:24:58] it's amazing how man always is always
[1:24:59] looking for another person to blame for
[1:25:02] the reason they or another person in the
[1:25:03] state they're in
[1:25:06] but Jesus answered neither has this
[1:25:08] man's sin nor his parents but that the
[1:25:10] works of God should be made manifest in
[1:25:12] him amen so there can be a trouble
[1:25:14] passed down through a family right so
[1:25:16] it's not even the parents fault or the
[1:25:18] or the child's fault but the reason
[1:25:19] that's there is that the works of God
[1:25:21] would be manifested I mean things can
[1:25:23] happen to us in life we're not looking
[1:25:25] for it we don't deserve it you know but
[1:25:27] but God allows it why that the works of
[1:25:29] God should be very manifest in you
[1:25:31] Hallelujah so this this man was not born
[1:25:34] blind by chance
[1:25:37] he was actually part of the prophecy
[1:25:39] that we read about from Isaiah hey man
[1:25:41] I'm trying I'm trying to build a point
[1:25:43] here because I'm coming something I mean
[1:25:44] now that's why they were that way right
[1:25:48] he wasn't born blind because of his evil
[1:25:50] or his parents he will know that the
[1:25:52] works of God would be made manifest amen
[1:25:54] see God ordained that they would be in
[1:25:56] that state that when the Fulfillment of
[1:25:59] that prophecy came it would be fulfilled
[1:26:01] in them see prophecy is not some vague
[1:26:04] thing it's actually for a people right
[1:26:06] there's a people that will fulfill the
[1:26:07] word of God Amen and they may not
[1:26:10] realize blind Bartimaeus and this man
[1:26:11] born blind I doubt very much they had
[1:26:13] Isaiah's prophecy on their mind when
[1:26:16] they realized they were blind right I
[1:26:18] don't believe they walked around saying
[1:26:19] he's going to restore the eyes of the
[1:26:21] blind here I am it's going to be
[1:26:23] fulfilled in my life no they were just
[1:26:24] going about their daily life amen but
[1:26:26] when God had that prophecy written
[1:26:28] Hallelujah he had them in mind so God
[1:26:32] ordained that they would be in their
[1:26:34] lives the Fulfillment of that prophecy
[1:26:35] would be in them now we are here as well
[1:26:39] that the prophecy in the word would be
[1:26:41] ordained would be fulfilled in our lives
[1:26:43] are you following me amen with when the
[1:26:46] word speaks of a Rapture when the what
[1:26:48] speaks for a bribe without spot or
[1:26:49] wrinkle or any such thing amen when God
[1:26:52] ordained Paul to write those words he
[1:26:55] was thinking of you amen when Malachi
[1:26:57] would write that it's in Elijah before
[1:26:58] the great and beautiful day of the Lord
[1:27:00] and He who's he God shall turn the
[1:27:02] hearts of who amen you back to back to
[1:27:06] God hallelujah see where Malachi wrote
[1:27:08] that he had God had you in mind amen
[1:27:11] when when the Apostle Paul wrote first
[1:27:12] Thessalonians 4 down he had God had you
[1:27:15] in mind amen but but you see now God
[1:27:18] would allow us to come out of many
[1:27:20] different backgrounds out of many
[1:27:22] different troubles out of many different
[1:27:24] livelihoods or whatever more we've all
[1:27:25] come out of something we all I trust
[1:27:28] have a testimony of God's Saving Grace
[1:27:29] amen where God's grace became amazing to
[1:27:32] us even if we came out of the world and
[1:27:34] we're raised out of a church peer we
[1:27:35] could literally Trace our lineage from
[1:27:38] believer to believer to believer to
[1:27:39] believer back to Adam they still got a
[1:27:41] time when you meet you know you've met
[1:27:42] God and his blood has come upon your
[1:27:44] life and you've been changed Amen to now
[1:27:47] so now so God is showing in those
[1:27:49] prophecies it doesn't matter what we
[1:27:51] came out of if we're part of that word
[1:27:54] God's going to transform us until we're
[1:27:56] ready to go to fulfill that amen
[1:27:59] hallelujah aren't you glad that God does
[1:28:01] that for us
[1:28:02] praise the Lord there's not us trying to
[1:28:05] it's not us trying to match the word
[1:28:06] it's God actually causes us to match the
[1:28:09] word
[1:28:10] hallelujah amen so it's not us trying to
[1:28:12] be Christians in our own strength it's
[1:28:13] actually the spirit of God comes in and
[1:28:15] then he's a Christian in our lives
[1:28:18] praise the Lord I'm so thankful for that
[1:28:20] Hallelujah so now
[1:28:22] so now you've got to look at all trouble
[1:28:24] and say no the reason this trouble is
[1:28:26] sure maybe I cause this trouble maybe I
[1:28:29] cause the sin to come into my family but
[1:28:31] ultimately I believe that that that that
[1:28:33] it's that the works of God should be
[1:28:34] made manifest
[1:28:36] shall we repent shall we say Lord
[1:28:38] forgive me it's my Fallen nature as loud
[1:28:39] as I come in in this trouble but Lord I
[1:28:41] believe this has come into my life that
[1:28:43] your Works would be made manifest in me
[1:28:45] amen whether it be healing or
[1:28:47] Deliverance whatever it is amen
[1:28:49] that's the works of God praise the Lord
[1:28:52] Hallelujah so now the disciples
[1:28:55] looked at a lot of things they had to
[1:28:57] real you know many times they were just
[1:28:58] living in the moment but it was the word
[1:29:00] being fulfilled as we read there in Luke
[1:29:02] another time was when was when in
[1:29:05] Matthew 21 where Jesus was going to come
[1:29:08] into Jerusalem and actually tells two of
[1:29:10] his disciples go and you'll find a cult
[1:29:12] there and you know unloose them and then
[1:29:14] you know when when when the man who owns
[1:29:16] it comes out says what are you doing
[1:29:17] says the master has has need of him you
[1:29:19] know and bring him here Jesus did not
[1:29:21] say it now boys this is what I'm going
[1:29:23] to fulfill
[1:29:24] but hold on here comes your king coming
[1:29:26] to you riding on a you know you know
[1:29:28] riding upon a donkey meeking lowly no he
[1:29:30] just said go do this and it began to be
[1:29:32] fulfilled in front of them
[1:29:34] hallelujah what was going on now
[1:29:36] prophecy was becoming history
[1:29:39] Hallelujah but then now we come down to
[1:29:42] to Acts chapter 2. and then when the day
[1:29:45] of Pentecost had fully come amen when
[1:29:47] when when when everyone outside thought
[1:29:49] that that the disciples the other 120
[1:29:51] they were drunk with new wine Pete would
[1:29:54] stand up and say no we're not drunken as
[1:29:55] you suppose just being the third out of
[1:29:57] the day but this is that spoken by the
[1:29:58] prophet Joel amen so so now it was
[1:30:01] actually the Holy Ghost in Peter telling
[1:30:03] the people what you're seeing in front
[1:30:05] of you is the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:30:07] that is no longer a prophecy that's
[1:30:09] looking to history but now it's actually
[1:30:11] being fulfilled right now Holier where
[1:30:14] God himself would come and dwell in a
[1:30:16] people
[1:30:17] Hallelujah she said it shall come to
[1:30:19] pass in the last day saith God I'll pour
[1:30:22] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:30:24] sons and your daughter shall prophesy
[1:30:25] and your young men shall see visions and
[1:30:28] your old men shall dream dreams and all
[1:30:29] my servants and all my handmaids will I
[1:30:31] pour out in those days of my spirit and
[1:30:33] they shall prophesy Hallelujah so so he
[1:30:37] he he could identify this is what Joel
[1:30:40] spoke of so it was a vision it was a
[1:30:43] prophecy now it's in fulfillment but
[1:30:45] notice this is and it shall come to pass
[1:30:47] in the last days so he speak out more
[1:30:49] than just one day but two days Days
[1:30:51] right now we know that one day with God
[1:30:55] Is A Thousand Years upon the Earth right
[1:30:57] so in these last two thousand years now
[1:30:59] God's Gonna pour His Spirit out upon All
[1:31:01] Flesh amen and even through the church
[1:31:04] ages the Holy Ghost has been poured out
[1:31:06] I mean but in this but in these last
[1:31:08] days now the Holy Ghost is actually
[1:31:10] poured out without measure
[1:31:12] it's not restricted it's not just a
[1:31:15] partial word being restored but the full
[1:31:16] Promises of God have been restored amen
[1:31:19] we're not just under a justification or
[1:31:20] a sanctification or even the gifts I
[1:31:22] mean but we have all that and The Giver
[1:31:24] it's the giver himself came down that's
[1:31:26] whatever the day of Pentecost The Giver
[1:31:28] himself came and dwelt on his people
[1:31:30] that when Peter walked out the you know
[1:31:33] the disciples walked out it was no
[1:31:34] longer them living but Christ Living in
[1:31:36] them amen what happened now now now the
[1:31:38] Believers are the mechanics
[1:31:40] right but brother M says we must have
[1:31:43] the Dynamics and the mechanics rise is
[1:31:45] not just the mechanics of being a
[1:31:47] Believer but there's got to be a dynamic
[1:31:49] power that causes the word to be
[1:31:51] manifested in our lives and I want to
[1:31:53] say this the Redeemer has come to Zion
[1:31:55] the the Dynamics are here I mean we're
[1:31:58] not just quoting a prophet and quoting
[1:32:00] the message that's all very good quoting
[1:32:02] the scripture but we see the one who
[1:32:04] gave the promise fulfilling the promise
[1:32:05] I mean so the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:08] the Dynamics of the word are actually
[1:32:10] living right in front of you and I Halle
[1:32:12] we're not looking for it to come it's
[1:32:14] here amen just like the Ducks there
[1:32:16] waiting for water no it's raining but
[1:32:19] what has lifted us up above the above
[1:32:21] the fusses between churches all those
[1:32:22] things that stuff's gone away we're
[1:32:24] being lifted up above it aiming because
[1:32:26] the Dynamics now if God has restored his
[1:32:29] word and God has poured himself out now
[1:32:31] without measure amen and so what has
[1:32:33] that done that's actually now the
[1:32:35] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is in the
[1:32:37] church to prove that Jesus Christ is the
[1:32:40] same yesterday today and forever to
[1:32:42] prove that every Divine promise of God
[1:32:43] is true amen because there's always a
[1:32:45] dispute is the word right or is it wrong
[1:32:47] I mean you take that Easter time there's
[1:32:49] going to be you know there's a dispute
[1:32:51] Jesus knew he'd race it was a revelation
[1:32:53] to him he went to Calvary with one
[1:32:55] scripture revealed to him that that he
[1:32:57] was not going to stay dead and that was
[1:32:59] when David would prophesy saying I'll
[1:33:01] not leave my thy soul and Hell neither
[1:33:03] suffer suffer my Holy One to see
[1:33:05] corruption that was a revelation to the
[1:33:07] Lord Jesus right so he went to Calvary
[1:33:09] knowing that his body would not Decay
[1:33:10] but he'd be resurrected again amen but
[1:33:13] now then then on that Easter morning
[1:33:15] there was still a dispute will he raise
[1:33:17] will he not raise amen me but then God
[1:33:19] came down to prove that his word was
[1:33:21] true what happened the the mechanics of
[1:33:23] the body of the Lord Jesus was dead in
[1:33:25] the Tomb but then the Dynamics himself
[1:33:27] came down raised them back to life again
[1:33:29] roll the St you know Stone out of the
[1:33:32] way and he walked out triumphant proving
[1:33:35] that what was prophesied was now in
[1:33:37] fulfillment and so the dispute was over
[1:33:39] now we come to our lives we think many
[1:33:41] times are we Christians are we going to
[1:33:43] make it amen yo sure we may line up with
[1:33:45] the word and all sincerity we repent we
[1:33:48] are baptized name of Jesus Christ you
[1:33:50] know we live according to the word our
[1:33:51] sincerity but then but then now when the
[1:33:53] Dynamics comes down I mean the Holy
[1:33:56] Ghost comes down and lives in US amen
[1:33:58] all all worries should be gone all
[1:34:02] strive should be over I mean all
[1:34:04] questions am I going to make it am I
[1:34:05] going to be in heaven that that's
[1:34:07] actually been answered holy because why
[1:34:09] the Dynamics comes down the Holy Ghost
[1:34:11] comes down into you and God tells you
[1:34:13] because I love you you shall live also
[1:34:15] amen you're alive right now in Jesus
[1:34:17] Christ hallelujah amen to the Dynamics
[1:34:20] are here friends amen hallelujah and all
[1:34:23] it will do is get greater and greater
[1:34:25] why what happens because expectation
[1:34:27] begins to grow amen before the before
[1:34:29] Azusa Street there was an expectation
[1:34:31] for for Revival Los Angeles was actually
[1:34:34] a lot of people were were crying out for
[1:34:36] God to do something as a whole burden of
[1:34:39] prayer upon the whole city pretty much
[1:34:40] but then in a little a little house amen
[1:34:43] is when the gifts were restored so it
[1:34:45] went from expectation of God can do it
[1:34:47] to now an expectation God does it and
[1:34:49] he'll do more that's the same thing with
[1:34:51] you and I you know when you first hear
[1:34:53] testimonies but you've never experienced
[1:34:54] the power of God what happens Faith
[1:34:56] begins to rise and you get expectation
[1:34:58] God can do it look we've got record that
[1:35:00] he's done anything spy infallible proofs
[1:35:03] we know that his word is true but then
[1:35:04] when you experience the dynamic power of
[1:35:06] the Holy Ghost amen it increases your
[1:35:09] expectation because it's not he will do
[1:35:11] it but he has done it and he'll do more
[1:35:13] amen that's how we should be this
[1:35:14] morning he has done it he will do it and
[1:35:17] he'll do more Eamonn he'll pour His
[1:35:19] Spirit out more he will deliver more
[1:35:21] he'll fill with the Holy Ghost more
[1:35:23] he'll pour out his peace more amen he
[1:35:26] will guide us with a far greater hand
[1:35:28] amen he will move in power more amen our
[1:35:32] services will lose human control more
[1:35:34] hallelujah hallelujah this is this is
[1:35:36] the expectation we should have amen
[1:35:39] because why because God is in control of
[1:35:41] his church right I mean if we've really
[1:35:43] surrendered Our Lives to the Lord we are
[1:35:45] no longer our own it's no longer as I
[1:35:49] said last Sunday we don't have a plan B
[1:35:50] in life his word is it and that's the
[1:35:53] plan just like Jesus when hears and
[1:35:55] Gethsemane amen he didn't say not my
[1:35:57] will but thy will be done and I'll just
[1:35:59] go with you and see how this goes no he
[1:36:02] fully stranded his will no matter what
[1:36:04] he had to suffer he went through anyway
[1:36:06] and that should be the same thing with
[1:36:08] you and I it doesn't matter how bad
[1:36:09] things get how Troublesome things get it
[1:36:11] seems you know it doesn't matter how
[1:36:13] much it seems like prayer is not being
[1:36:14] answered we're not leaving
[1:36:16] I mean all the bridges have been burnt
[1:36:18] I'm not going back I have nowhere to
[1:36:20] return to amen I burned every bridge
[1:36:23] amen when the Lord called me I said Lord
[1:36:24] I'm walking with you I don't know where
[1:36:26] you'll Lead Me day to day but I know
[1:36:28] you'll Lead Me day to day holy it
[1:36:30] doesn't matter how much trouble how much
[1:36:31] Strife how much worry comes in don't
[1:36:34] look at those things just trust your
[1:36:35] Shepherd he will guide you through
[1:36:38] Hallelujah Amen to the Dynamics are here
[1:36:41] Amen brother Brown says the Dynamics is
[1:36:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:36:45] right the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost and
[1:36:48] this is the Dynamics of this church will
[1:36:50] be a refilling of the holy spirit that
[1:36:52] has worked in a small measure while The
[1:36:54] Headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:36:55] the body but when the head and the body
[1:36:57] unites together the full power of the
[1:36:59] Holy Ghost will race her up just exactly
[1:37:01] like that even the dead that's dead in
[1:37:03] Christ for hundreds of years ago will
[1:37:05] raise up in the beauty of his Holiness
[1:37:06] and take a flight to the skies the
[1:37:09] Dynamics is the holy spirit so it says
[1:37:11] it's been working in small measure but
[1:37:13] it's going to get greater it's going to
[1:37:15] get greater amen it's not going to
[1:37:16] diminish it's going to get greater so
[1:37:18] God is going to move in a more powerful
[1:37:19] I just want to raise your expectation I
[1:37:21] mean what we've seen is nothing compared
[1:37:23] to what's ahead of us I believe it amen
[1:37:24] God is all-powerful he can do all things
[1:37:27] amen he can you know there's nothing
[1:37:28] that he cannot do amen he can restore
[1:37:31] amen he can restore your bodies missing
[1:37:34] limbs amen he can put a desire in
[1:37:36] someone's heart who's had no desire for
[1:37:38] God Amen he can do anything he wants to
[1:37:40] but he needs you to speak it amen he
[1:37:42] needs us to be surrendered remember the
[1:37:45] third Paul all it's not us naming and
[1:37:47] claiming
[1:37:48] brother Brown when he was hunting didn't
[1:37:50] say I feel like speaking squirrels into
[1:37:52] existence today no God initiated it
[1:37:56] and he responded and God manifested it
[1:37:58] right and it's the same thing with you
[1:38:00] and I we just walk with the Lord he
[1:38:03] initiates it when we have a need we
[1:38:05] respond and he manifests it right holy
[1:38:08] it's not us saying well let there be
[1:38:10] whatever whatever that's what the world
[1:38:12] has made it right no no it's not that
[1:38:15] just walk with God and love him and he
[1:38:17] will do it Hallelujah you've ever had a
[1:38:20] time in prayer where you realize it's
[1:38:21] not you praying
[1:38:23] and God and it's actually God praying
[1:38:26] through you what is that that's actually
[1:38:28] the third pull I put it that way it's
[1:38:30] God take it it's God taking over your
[1:38:31] lips and you're speaking
[1:38:33] Hallelujah with him we then we ought to
[1:38:36] stay in the condition where God can do
[1:38:38] that anytime he wants I mean we want to
[1:38:40] be available for whatever he wants to do
[1:38:42] if he just wants to use us once in our
[1:38:44] lives praise God I'll keep walking with
[1:38:46] him like he'll do it again amen if he
[1:38:48] wants to do it every day praise God but
[1:38:50] we just got to be available see and this
[1:38:53] is why the devil always brings in
[1:38:54] fussing and fighting and trouble because
[1:38:56] he wants us to leave our first love he
[1:38:58] tries to distract us with something else
[1:39:00] and sure there's a lot of distractions
[1:39:02] here
[1:39:03] right that can cause a lot of trouble
[1:39:05] but if we but love looks beyond the
[1:39:08] humanity amen that we can actually keep
[1:39:10] walking in our first love see the power
[1:39:12] of his salvation will always be tested
[1:39:16] but it won't fail
[1:39:18] amen hallelujah amen his blood will be
[1:39:19] tested but it will never fail so the
[1:39:21] devil does not believe that it is enough
[1:39:24] to stop I mean I mean he believes it's
[1:39:26] not enough to stop him stop the devil
[1:39:29] but the power of the Cross is more than
[1:39:32] enough to stop any demon of Hell Amen
[1:39:35] brother Adam said when he had the vision
[1:39:37] of the Finnish Boy you know you know and
[1:39:40] there's two two years before it happened
[1:39:41] he he told everyone write this down the
[1:39:43] Flyleaf of your Bible and then he found
[1:39:45] himself in Finland and he came before
[1:39:47] the accident and he didn't even realize
[1:39:49] where he was but then he began to look
[1:39:50] around and actually turned away from the
[1:39:52] accident just feeling sorry for the
[1:39:53] child and the parents but he felt a hand
[1:39:55] on his shoulder and he turned around
[1:39:56] then he began to look at the scene again
[1:39:58] this is I've actually seen this before
[1:40:00] amen I remember the mountains I remember
[1:40:02] the boy was dressed like that he said to
[1:40:04] Brother Moore you know open the Flyleaf
[1:40:06] of your Bible is this not what was
[1:40:07] prophesied and he began to realize it
[1:40:09] was no longer prophecy but it was
[1:40:11] actually happening right in front of him
[1:40:12] amen then then he had confidence he said
[1:40:14] now every demon in Hell could line up
[1:40:16] and it wouldn't stop the boy raising
[1:40:18] from the dead why because what God had
[1:40:20] spoken was now in front of him he was
[1:40:21] living in the vision amen if we're if we
[1:40:24] realize we're living in the vision of
[1:40:25] the word amen that what God has said see
[1:40:28] many times we say the world the tears
[1:40:30] have come to maturity hold on look how
[1:40:34] mature Sodom and Gomorrah is it's no
[1:40:35] longer a baby it's no longer a little
[1:40:37] leaf coming out of the ground it's now
[1:40:38] it's you know it's seeds are spreading
[1:40:40] everywhere
[1:40:41] it's in a mature form now if the tears
[1:40:44] are that way what about the wheat I mean
[1:40:46] because they'll both grow together I
[1:40:48] mean even now actually the tears have
[1:40:50] been bound for the burning I mean do you
[1:40:52] remember I can't I think it was bro um I
[1:40:54] can't remember his name exactly but but
[1:40:56] but there's a brother that that that
[1:40:58] gave a testimony and you know he was in
[1:41:00] Pentecost he's a Pentecostal pastor and
[1:41:02] he was part of the part of the arranging
[1:41:05] of one of the first International
[1:41:07] passers conventions in America now he
[1:41:09] had a friend that that came to the
[1:41:11] message
[1:41:12] and but that man wasn't converted when
[1:41:15] he first tried to share it with him and
[1:41:17] his friend was a big man and literally
[1:41:18] picked him up and pinned him against the
[1:41:19] wall and said you want to grow up
[1:41:20] spiritually
[1:41:21] but then years later he met the same
[1:41:24] friend and his nature was totally
[1:41:25] changed why because God had done a work
[1:41:27] in his life it wasn't just his Zeal and
[1:41:29] yes praise God God's in a prophet and
[1:41:30] the word is true but that word came into
[1:41:32] his life and changed him
[1:41:34] and then now this man started reading I
[1:41:36] think it's I think his name was brother
[1:41:38] Robert Milligan or something I might
[1:41:39] have that completely wrong but I'll find
[1:41:40] the testimony and put it on the WhatsApp
[1:41:42] but then now he was reading the church
[1:41:44] age book and all this while he's he he
[1:41:46] he's planning this this convention and
[1:41:49] he came to the first meeting
[1:41:51] uh light and he comes in and everyone's
[1:41:54] on their feet shouting and rejoicing and
[1:41:56] the pastor that's preaching saying
[1:41:57] basically we don't need to look for the
[1:41:59] coming of the Lord the Lord's not coming
[1:42:00] back we're going to eat the corner of
[1:42:02] the land and here we are and everyone's
[1:42:03] all happy and and and it's a brother
[1:42:05] Robert or Richard I think it was you
[1:42:06] know he's thinking what is this and
[1:42:08] everyone's shouting rejoicing thousands
[1:42:10] of people in an auditorium and then it's
[1:42:12] like the sound is completely turned off
[1:42:14] and a voice speaks to him and says this
[1:42:17] is what you read in the book by my
[1:42:19] prophet of The Binding of the tears
[1:42:21] where this false Doctrine that's being
[1:42:23] being preached is buying the tears for
[1:42:25] the burning and then a boy said you
[1:42:27] better get out otherwise you'll be bound
[1:42:28] also he ran out of that place he never
[1:42:30] returned it's already happening
[1:42:33] so the tears have matured and are being
[1:42:35] bound for the burning what about now the
[1:42:37] grain
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:40] amen because if that's mature this is
[1:42:43] mature amen if the tears are mature then
[1:42:45] the bride is mature amen holy see we're
[1:42:48] no longer a stalk under Wesley or
[1:42:49] whatever more but no the grain is back
[1:42:51] again brother Graham said what was
[1:42:53] planted is now here
[1:42:55] Hallelujah I'm looking at grain here
[1:42:57] people I'm no longer a mixture of seed
[1:42:59] of tears and whatnot I'm looking at
[1:43:01] grain I talk about a seed in your soul
[1:43:03] amen not your Humanity but a seed in
[1:43:05] your soul holy so now if the grain is
[1:43:07] here
[1:43:08] praise God why don't the grain to be
[1:43:11] doing all right Amy because many people
[1:43:13] they'll take a quote saying well brother
[1:43:14] Bram says we're just going to relay in
[1:43:16] the presence of the Sun and ripen the
[1:43:18] grain is green who's read that
[1:43:20] right and then people paint that as a
[1:43:22] picture of now we're just sunbathing
[1:43:24] you know and and we're not doing
[1:43:26] anything we're just because there's not
[1:43:27] a lot of movement down the grain it's
[1:43:28] just a piece of grain on the on the
[1:43:30] table and it's ripening and things now
[1:43:32] that sounds very nice I like the Sun but
[1:43:35] that's not true
[1:43:36] because what did the first grain do all
[1:43:39] right see if rain has come back again
[1:43:40] what did the first grain do now Jesus
[1:43:43] when he was born he didn't lay ripen in
[1:43:45] the presence of the sun right here's the
[1:43:47] first grain now what did he do he cast
[1:43:49] out devils
[1:43:51] he healed the sick he raised the dead
[1:43:53] amen he he spoke to the storms and he
[1:43:57] showed he had dominion over all demons
[1:44:00] he had dominion over nature he had
[1:44:02] dominion over everything
[1:44:04] Hallelujah see see this is what the
[1:44:07] first grain did amen the first grain
[1:44:08] turned the other cheek
[1:44:10] the first grain loved his enemies amen
[1:44:13] the first grain forgave without even an
[1:44:16] apology coming first amen he loved that
[1:44:19] those that betrayed him he called Judas
[1:44:22] friend he wasn't being sarcastic
[1:44:24] right so this is what the first grain
[1:44:26] did amen he didn't hold The Grudge
[1:44:28] he didn't have any Feud against anyone
[1:44:30] he didn't have any odd he didn't have
[1:44:32] anything like that there's no malice
[1:44:34] drive for Envy in this grain
[1:44:36] this is what the first crane did hey we
[1:44:37] love to talk about Jesus walking on
[1:44:39] water but what about turning the other
[1:44:40] cheek
[1:44:41] what about what about saying father
[1:44:43] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:44:44] do I mean what about calling those that
[1:44:46] betray you friend
[1:44:48] hello what about that that's what the
[1:44:51] first grain did Amen in it now if the
[1:44:52] grain is back amen the second
[1:44:55] the grain should do the same because
[1:44:57] it's the same grain amen see we're part
[1:44:58] we're made of the same material you know
[1:45:00] you were made of the word amen so can
[1:45:02] you love your enemy can you love those
[1:45:04] that despitefully use you or do you hold
[1:45:06] a grudge do you stew on what they've
[1:45:08] said and what they've done and all those
[1:45:10] things and they should have done this
[1:45:11] and why didn't do the are you chewing on
[1:45:13] those things or can you forgive them can
[1:45:16] you love those that have an ought
[1:45:17] against you can you love those who don't
[1:45:19] want to be reconciled with you
[1:45:21] that's what the first grain did halia we
[1:45:25] are the same material amen can we can we
[1:45:27] look at our brother and sister that we
[1:45:29] know that they actually are out to get
[1:45:30] us you know we should never have this
[1:45:32] attitude that we want to see people fail
[1:45:35] we should never want to you know
[1:45:37] actually have a have something in our
[1:45:39] heart when people leave church saying
[1:45:40] well I I knew that would happen
[1:45:42] well if you really had that kind of
[1:45:44] discernment you would have gone to them
[1:45:45] before they ever left and said are you
[1:45:47] okay how are you doing how's things even
[1:45:50] if they don't respond to you at least
[1:45:52] try
[1:45:53] Hallelujah see see we should never have
[1:45:55] this while yeah I knew that would happen
[1:45:58] oh my God what a prophet you are
[1:46:01] you know but see people get it get that
[1:46:04] in their mind I knew that family would
[1:46:06] fall apart I knew that this would happen
[1:46:08] we should never be that way it was the
[1:46:10] first grain like that
[1:46:11] amen he loved everybody
[1:46:14] he loved Caiaphas the same as he did
[1:46:16] John
[1:46:18] he because the love of God doesn't
[1:46:20] change
[1:46:21] right but it's how it's received that
[1:46:23] meant you know that matters amen you
[1:46:26] know the Rich Young Ruler Jesus said and
[1:46:27] he loved him but the love wasn't
[1:46:29] received otherwise he would have sold
[1:46:31] over his Goods to the poor and followed
[1:46:32] the Lord amen but that's what the first
[1:46:34] grain did
[1:46:35] we should be see the first grain
[1:46:38] suffered wrong and took it
[1:46:41] can we suffer wrong and take it or do we
[1:46:43] have to reply in kind
[1:46:44] or or do it or or retaliate some other
[1:46:47] way or can we just suffer wrong
[1:46:50] amen see he threw it the first grain
[1:46:53] surrendered his own will to his fathers
[1:46:55] so he went to Calvary as a man can we
[1:46:58] actually surrender our own will
[1:47:00] that's actually the will of God is
[1:47:02] greater than her own will
[1:47:03] can we surrender our own will that if
[1:47:07] someone else
[1:47:08] in the family who wants something that
[1:47:10] we could last fight out wants to to
[1:47:12] allow them to have theirs as long as
[1:47:14] it's right right or is it always me me I
[1:47:16] I now now remember this is the me
[1:47:18] generation me too hashtag me too no it
[1:47:21] should be God
[1:47:23] right
[1:47:25] don't take that out of context you know
[1:47:27] all those things are wrong what's
[1:47:28] happened to people but yeah but but you
[1:47:29] understand it
[1:47:30] it is a metoo generation I want it me me
[1:47:33] me but can we lay aside those things
[1:47:36] for the greater good of our family and
[1:47:38] different things
[1:47:39] that's what the first grain did he saw
[1:47:42] your need he didn't have to go to
[1:47:44] Calvary
[1:47:46] but out of his own choice he did he
[1:47:48] wasn't a robot
[1:47:49] he chose to
[1:47:51] can we be that same kind of a person
[1:47:54] amen he says now we see last night
[1:47:57] uh no sorry we said last night we have
[1:47:59] so much mechanics and not the Dynamics
