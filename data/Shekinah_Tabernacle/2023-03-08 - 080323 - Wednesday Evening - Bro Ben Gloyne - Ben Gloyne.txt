just um bow ahead so it's great to have the notes Here God bless you great to have you here praise the Lord amen amen let's um oh let's read the scriptures everyone's getting comfortable and so on let's go to uh we're gonna go to Psalms 19 I'm going to read the first few verses of Psalms 19 and um yeah we're going to read our verses one down to verse 6 here this is the so there's everyone there some people are real quick off the trigger some people are still loading the black powder and getting the ball in but hey we're here okay oh yeah also just a reminder there's a lot of weapons in the kitchen the kitchen's turned into an Armory there's a lot of Bibles in there please take your weapons home with you take your sword home don't um don't walk out of these doors unarmed you got to be packing pack the most powerful weapon of the word of God so don't leave them here remember your Bibles for all the week yes okay so it's a kitchen it's not an Armory okay you should have your own Armory at home okay so just yet just a reminder there Psalms 19 and verse 1 the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day and today utter of speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no speech no language where their tongue is not heard their line has gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race he'd goeth forth he his going forth is from the end of the heavens and a circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof amen this is going to go to Daniel chapter 12 I'm going to read uh two verses here verses three and four of Daniel chapter 12. and if you need a Bible let us know we can get you one okay so don't just pick up one from there and use it and then put it back if you need one we can get your Bible okay amen you know about money or price you need a Bible get your Bible all right amen So Daniel 12 and verses 3 and 4. as it speaks of this date and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased we live in that day many people travel that's the thought covert's not going to shut down travel because the Bible says men will run to and fro travels back on and knowledge shall be increased it has ever been a day like this day with knowledge increased amen this bowel heads in a word of prayer if you ever need just want to raise your hand before the Lord amen let's pray together gracious father we uh Lord we want to give ourselves away to you Lord Jesus that you can use us Lord that your name would be glorified Lord that your salvation will be made known oh God that you would be glorified in everything we say and do Lord we love you so much we are so thankful we can come into your presence once again Lord As We Gather in this place dear God we want to thank you that we can Lord we take you at your word we say we're two or three gathered in my name there you are in the midst Lords are based on your word your walking among us even now so we welcome you king of kings and Lord of lords and we want to pray dear God that you'll meet every need in this service you see the hands that have been raised Lord you know the needs behind those hands Lord so I pray you'd meet them Lord for your glory Lord and we love you we thank you for this evening Lord bless all those who couldn't be here Lord I know Lord my darling is driving home from taranaki now I'll keep her safe on the road and anyone else journeying anyone who's unwell and body May heal them Lord and me touch us all like only you can For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you friends you can have your seats tonight um I can drive this can't I is I can drive this I can drive this so so William brought me a picture book uh this morning and and and it's not the words that really matter here but what I want to show you from this picture and really got me going is that here here the um here there's this yeah I call daddy bear and uh you know sun bear whatever you know the two beers right as the father and son or mother and daughter whatever right but but but the father's pointing out into the stars and actually telling telling the child we're Written in the Stars before you ever got here you're actually written in the stars now brother Brown tells us that that the first Bible ever written was was written in the stars as uh this is from brother James O'Day plug for his photos he's an amazing photographer but anyway but you know we know that the Bible the first Bible was written in the stars as as Joe would be asked by God when God would actually lay out talk about Orion and Pleiades and different things and because he was actually showing showing job the Bible he was reading but we know that this is not the Bible we read okay we know you know the first Bible was written in the stars the second one was written in the Great Pyramids Enoch wrote the Bible in the pyramids but the third Bible this one is the one we read amen but the message in there is actually the message in here but the Lord's opened this one to us right so the Zodiac and astrology all that stuff is just a perversion of actually the true message in there but the thing is what I wanted to what I what what really spoke to me was that where our lives are written in the word just like our lives are Written in the Stars each each star has to take a certain position and it and it speaks as we read there and um uh we read there in Psalms how utterance speech you know so so the Stars their Arrangement actually preached to the Earth and everyone under Heaven can understand it and so now brother Brown would say in the greatest battle ever fought he says now um um so so he's speaking in the um um speaking about the Stars he says and somewhere in there I had it pointed out to me this is when he was in a big Observatory one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming through the cancer age down until the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ by the Virgin the sin coming by the line of the tribe of Judah and I said I've tried my best to see that zodiac I just can't see it but yet it's there those who are trained I know it's their job saw it men used to look at it it was a Bible and what uh at one day but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sits in the midst of all of it he looks down Paul is in there my mother's in there somewhere looking down so we're all represented by those stars and I thought of the order of that Heavenly Host not one of them out of place everyone keeps his time perfectly God's Great Army I thought of the soldiers how that if that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would recover again with water in just a few minutes the Earth would just be like it was when God decided to use it for um for us to have it here on it was well it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the breath of the Earth and if that Moon would ever move it would do the same thing again when the when the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth the tide comes up and when it goes down just follows the tides it's God's Great Army and when I thought about God's Great Army there now we went to bed and then I began to think that not one of those is out of their place they're all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it will cause it will affect this Earth we just see the results of it now from some of them moving into their other spots it's effective it affects everything and I thought then if that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place and make everything an order what about the disorderly of the Heavenly Host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit because because we know the gravitational pull of the stars and the nebulas and the galaxies it all affects one another and but God said it perfect rather they can predict thousands of years in the future win like Haley's Comet will come again and different comments that go out of their solar system come back around they can predict when they come and when they come they're not surprised they're right on time why because it's God's Great Army you know when the changing of the seasons we know the moon um you know it's saying Genesis that the moon was was created to rule the night that the moon would have dominion in the night time and the moon represents the bride of Christ so in this night time that we live in where the Son of God is Not upon the Earth as he was you know you know in the days of his flesh but in this night time where we are just a reflector of that light we're here to rule the night Amen to have dominion over the powers of Darkness every demon power spiritual witchcraft Rebellion whatever it is we have power over all of them but the greatest thing we must realize is that we cannot fight this battle alone we know every Army that's ever been successful is not a group of individuals fighting as individuals you know but uh but uh but but but Warfare is a team sport there's not a bunch of rambos running around with a big sword or a big X or a big machine gun and whatever and no it's not that it's a group fighting as one and we're told that you know the Roman army one of the greatest reasons that they had so much success is because of their leadership structure from the Centurion up to the general or whatever ago they had a specific leadership structure that as the battle would change they could adapt their tactics based on what was going on because they had an effective leadership structure and even their helmets if you look at them there's a gap where the errors so so they could hear the commands and the trumpets perfectly because the their helmets did not obscure their ears and they could adapt in the battle because they were fighting as a as one man not as a bunch of individuals you know it says when the um when they would uh attack the Gauls and you know especially in England different things you know these guys would get off their chariots and just charge in like headlong by themselves they just got cut down because they weren't fighting as a team they're fighting as individuals and so it's so important that we don't fight as individuals we know it's an individual walk we understand that right but the effect we have on one another and against the powers of Satan are combined or more powerful if we walk in harmony we with the word of God it's so vital Abraham says when you leave the word you leave God right so we so if we stand harmony with the word we're walking with God Amen so it's very important that we that we keep this in mind because because we are God's Great Army you may not have realized it but you've signed up you enlisted you weren't drafted or forced you've enlisted willingly to fight for this great cause I meant to fight for the kingdoms of Heaven to tear down every work of the devil every complex pain and fear and anything the devil can put on someone we're called to tears Aiden's Kingdom down and that's not overthrowing governments and all that stuff God will take care of that in the in the tribulation whatever more and you know he'll set up his kingdom upon the Earth in the Millennium but that's his doing but right now we're here to build the kingdom of God in the hearts of men and women boys and girls by the leadership I mean by by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean so now the Bible speaks in the Old Testament how they would set their armies in a ray now an array is a is a row it's to be arranged to be put in order so when they would fight battles they would then just run and headlong by themselves they were set in a formation and the and the success of many battles was because of the formation that they would attack in you know many many many armies even outnumbered if they had the right formation they would win the battle like they you know like the um uh French I mean I mean the English against the French in the Hundred Year War there's battles of the battle of Asian core and different battles where there were vastly outnumbered by the French but because of their formation their setup they won the day and we we may be smaller number but we know that you know we are actually the majority but if we can walk remember the Bible says in the Old Testament one will chase a thousand until Chase ten thousand and that's just against a natural you know enemy but but we fight a far greater further than Flesh and Blood we don't fight Flesh and Blood we fight against demon power spiritual wickedness in high places anointings of demon Fallen Angels upon people we fight those things amen so but the thing is if one will chase a thousand two Chase ten thousand how much more how many would we Chase I haven't done the math but you know I believe that that hundred thousand thousand demons loose out of Riverview Euphrates or 100 million however many I think we would whoop them hey man you say yo yo because people say well all of Hell's upon the Earth we're living in Hell's on the Earth all this trouble now but all Heavens here also amen because why because God has poured out Heaven upon the bride of Christ amen that we have a far greater weapon far greater you know God is always greater than the devil I mean but we must walk in unity for the full power of God to be manifested amen because it would say in the Book of Psalms you know how great is the unity among Brethren it's like the anointing all that went down to Aaron's bed all over his garments now you know he had to be anointed to go into the holy of holies to do the to to to to to to manifest or carry out his office of high priest if he wasn't anointed he couldn't carry out his god-given role now how much more you and I right if there's no Unity among us we can't fulfill our office as the bride of Christ right we cannot intercede to the full capacity on behalf of this world on behalf of Fallen people you know we can't preach we can't have meeting you know if there was if there's division in a church how hard would it be for a song-leader to lead songs how hard would it be for a preacher to preach if there's Unity there's a resistance there's a hardness it's like you're fighting the air but then when there's Unity of spirit when there's a hunger to meet God and be in contact with him and it's not fussing and fighting and well I wonder what he's going to say now no none of that but no Lord I want to hear from you Lord I want you to come down lord lord I want you to touch lives Lord I want you to fill us with the Holy Ghost Lord Lord I want to see Miracles Lord I want to see people turn from unbelieving to Faith and God transforming power now if we have that kind of Desire now I believe we have this but you know we're going to look at the what we have and cherish what we have amen and you know not just not just settle with what we have but but desire more Hallelujah you know you're so so if we if we really came with that kind of unity who cares what kind of week you had leave it at the door there's there's this coat hanger Hat Racks hat things there we put coats by the front door take the problems of your week and leave it there and forget to pick it up you know if the if the kitchen turns up into a Dumping Ground of bad weeks that's fine I won't remind anyone of any of them they could and they would throw them out you know there's the wheelie bun see your butt but thing is don't worry about the week you've had you know we should expect a hard time or a stressful time when we come to church because the devil wants us so twisted up in our minds that takes all of the service to be unwanted and the service is done what if we just said praise God the battle's on but we're about to have church and praise God the devil's really twisted me up but we're about to have church God's going to move in a powerful way Hallelujah amen I think I think we can come with that kind of a expectation Hallelujah now to be set in a ray it sounds like a abstract idea but the Apostle Paul tells us how to do it as we're reading Colossians 3 and 18 he speaks about these things in three times you know three different places this is how you stay in Array because you want to be in battle formation eh when the enemy comes in just an ambush and he's just pulverized and you know brother man even says that we can live in such a way that we actually uh avoid him before he comes and hits us you know and and and I think that'd be a good way to live they're not always saying sorry Lord sorry and of course he's faithful and just to forgive us if we confess our sins but what do we better to to bypass it before it gets to us and we just can praise him all the time amen so now in Colossians 3 19 it said now now this is how we're in battle array because because to be in battle array starts at home because remember our our homes are a fortress it's a it's a sanctuary amen it's not a place to fight it's a place to have peace where you step out of Satan's eat and you open the front door you walk into eating conditions Hallelujah praise God Amen so he says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord so submit yourselves as they as it's in the Lord if it's not in the lord well stand your ground husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them this is how you stay in battle array don't have time to go into this in a deep way maybe in a future service children obey your parents in all things for its well pleasing unto the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger least they be discouraged servants obeying all things your Masters according to the flesh not with eye Service as men pleases but in sickness of heart fearing God and whatever you do do it hardly as to the Lord and not unto men knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ I think that covers everyone it covers fathers mothers children servants or people who work right and whatever you do do it as unto the Lord because there's a there there's a Synergy between a wife submitting and a husband loving there's a Synergy you know your Synergy feeds off each other right and also children of Bank you know all these scriptures are actually for for not to oppose upon one another but it's for us to take it on heart and say Lord manifest it through me right so I'm a husband so husbands love your wives be not better against them that's you know it's not me to tell Christine Christine you got to submit no no it's her to take that on board and actually say Lord live it through me now she doesn't need to ask help for that she's awesome she's amazing but you see and it's like children obey your parents we shouldn't be pushing down saying you gotta obey and do this and do this no this they should see the script and say Lord I want to I want to I want this to be manifested in me I don't want the spirit of rebellion of the world to come upon me amen and then fathers do not provoke your children to anger so I don't want to treat my girls or even willing that they get angry you know frustrate them all the time and the carrots too far away and trouble them and there's no no no clear boundaries or clear you know things that keep them settled in their Spirits you know because because that leads to discouragement discouragement so so I don't want to do that amen so this is this is what now this is to me this is how we get into battle array because it's not just church it's everyday life I mean because if you think about it if if there's Perfect Harmony all of us with God nothing between our soul and our savior then there's Perfect Harmony between husband and wife and Perfect Harmony between parents and children devil can't get in nowhere he just actually comes into like a it's like you know it's like just well we are lions right praise the lord it's like it's like Daniel's accusers being thrown to the Lions then they just got chewed up you know the devil tries to walk into a home where there's Harmony he just gets chewed up you know there'll be you know there should be such a you know a panic ring out in hell when the devil tells one of his imps go to the moodly household or go to the no dear household or whatever you go there and trouble them it should be such a cry you know there should be a you know a devil down in Hell having a heart attack having an aneurysm having a stroke being all stressed out because I don't want to go back there do you know what they did to me last week I'm still in a body cast man come on this is not fair it should be that way Hallelujah why because he just gets his lights knocked out and everything are knocked out and somehow it gets dragged back down to Hell and you know he's just in a he's on life support this is how the devil should be when he even is told when he you know one of his zims is told come bother this household Hallelujah that's how we should be why because we're in battle array God's Great Army upon the Earth Hallelujah amen now the how we doing for time we've done okay now in first Timothy the Apostle Paul calls himself a pattern now we'll just read this in in first Timothy 1 11 and 17. he says according to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed god of the Blessed God which is committed to my trust and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer a persecutor an injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting now unto the king Eternal uh Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen so the Apostle Paul is telling us that his life is a pattern now Jesus would tell us to pick up our cross deny ourselves pick up our cross and follow him you know Jesus spoke more about us bearing our own cross than he did his own and so we all have a cross to bear we all have a cross you know you know you know a lot of people don't want to talk about this kind of Christianity but he said you're going to pick up your cross and follow him if you're not willing to pick up your cross you can't be a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ so it's very important that we pick up our own cross now and and and we don't want to drop our cross before the time now a cross is not a besetting sin so I'm just going to put that out there from the get-go because well this is just a thorn the spirit is The Thorn In My Flesh you know I I just can't get rid of this lust of this pornography or this drinking or smoking or lying or whatever it's just a thought in the flesh to keep me humble no no that's just a excuse to keep a devil in your life because that person likes that spirit I mean but we should hate the devil we have no pardon him he has no part in us right we have no time for him there's no business hours open for him do not take his calls don't don't return his emails just just block them on every social media page you can find amen don't don't entertain him he's not here to be entertained he's been here just we're here to stand on his neck right he all he is is a is a welcome mat for your door to wipe your feet on and then you're going through and slam door on his face right so so don't entertain him right I mean so so we're here we must bear our own cross we all have a cross that we must bear now that cross is made and this is just my opinion I was just thinking about these things today a cross is there to actually manifest Jesus Christ now in the Old Testament every book because because every believer actually had to cross the bed wasn't called across in the Old Testament but every every believer has a cross to bear now Noah had the cross of the radical of ridicule of the scoffers he had to be worrying to bear that reproach to actually carry that cross of the scoffers and the mockers making fun of him as he built the ark for 120 years remember it was scientifically impossible for it to rain it never rained before at that time they'd just be due upon the Earth but there's no rain so he had to bear that cross of ridicule but he did right he didn't give up just because of the ridicule you know the critic has no life to give you they don't have the Holy Ghost they don't have the power of God it's amazing the you know yeah they put the life of brother bam under a microscope what if we put their life under the same microscope what kind of fruits would you see out of their lives not even worth one page website so Noah had the ridicule of scoffers Abraham had the burden of lot this is just me I might not be completely right with all these ones but they all everyone had a burden Jacob had the anger of Esau for stealing the birthright from him he had that that he had to live under right Moses had the failure of the dead Egyptian and the rejection of Israel because remember he killed the Egyptian he says basically here I am he says who are you to rule over us you know and then he had to run for his life Ruth had the had the cross to bear of being a moabite even after marrying Boaz you think about it you know not everyone there was spiritual in Israel not everyone saying praise the Lord You're a perfect picture of redemption and the Gentiles are going to come in one day and a gentile bride is going to be married to our Messiah no none of that I said what are you doing here I'm married to Boaz real but you know you know there's kind of a thing where we don't really quite fit in she fitted in boaz's house that was the main thing right because she was married to Boaz but you know it's like us today with other Christians they might even be blessed by our testimonies but there's just something about them that they put us at Arm's Reach because they believe funny things even though yes sure God works in their life yeah we've seen yep okay that's God praise the Lord for you but they keep you at Arm's Reach right who's experienced that why is that because it's like it's it's like it's like Ruth she didn't quite fit in with the rest of Israel but yet she was ordained just like the stars to come into the lineage of Jesus Christ amen David was rejected King he had to live with that cross of what he did with Bathsheba you know and then Absalom being killed and all those things see the devil studies Humanity he's been studying Humanity since the well before the fall because he studied Adam and Eve to find a weak point and then he got in and caused this chaos so he's very good at studying humanity and he's very methodical um with with how he does it he's methodical in his tactics you know he lays traps and snares for us and any hunter worth half of their ability is very methodical in their hunting technique doesn't matter what you're hunting you don't just go wander out there and I'm going to kill a deer good luck yeah you got to know what you're doing right the Devil is a master hunter we should never underestimate him he's very clever he's very good at laying chaps because he knows our Humanity now the same cross that we're called to carry he will use against us to try and destroy us now Moses Moses's cross was the people of Israel he carried them to the promised land he answered all their fussing he prayed for them when they had trouble he you know he spoke to the Rock and the water came he you know he did all those things right and then uh but the crowd but his cross was meant to meant to manifest allow Christ to be manifested through his life as intercessor so so when he carried that cross and he you know the people started fussing he interceded for them when God said I'm going to wipe them out and start with you why because God we had to carry across who's following me tonight the cross we carry is not just to be a burden it's for God to be manifested through that and then so Moses Moses would stand in the gap for Israel and we know that was Christ and Moses being displayed but then that same fussing made him lose his temper and he smote The Rock instead of speaking to the Rock so the devil used that same cross against them to Smite The Rock break the whole pattern of God and not go on the Promised Land because the devil knows how to use our Humanity against us he's very good at it he studied you a lot he started your family you think you know we get all excited I know my family true the devil's like oh yeah I know that I've known that a long time because he studied your weaknesses because he looks where where God begins to bless and he says um I know they're humanity and it it pulls up your family fail and starts using that against you so we all have a cross to beer but our cross is meant to be that the power of God can be manifested in our lives and not for the devil to use it against us that's okay to put it that way now Jesus said except the man be born of water and spirit he'll know as enter into the kingdom he that will follow after me let him deny himself and his own worldly pleasures take up his cross and follow after me the cross is a symbol of death of Agony he that will be a Christian let him strip himself of his own thoughts let him strip himself of his own works let him strip himself of everything denying himself and take up that consecrated cross and follow me daily he that will come after me let him do that that's what Jesus said so now if we are part of this heavenly host that's the Life we'll Live amen if we're part of this heavenly now we're not shooting stars shooting stars gather a lot of attention but they burn up in the atmosphere they're not in position they're not orbiting the Sun they're just flying around right we're not we're not asteroids we're not shooting stars that can just cause damage and Things No we're called to be set in the galaxies right in our in our position and if we are then what happens is is just as the just as the stars as we read in Psalms and I'm going to finish with this speech so that now that's preaching some people think that's a pretty picture actually that's God speaking to the world and you know the Earth is actually in a perfect part of the of the Milky Way to see it all if we're in a different part of the Milky Way you wouldn't see what you see so God put this planet here for us to look up and see that why because he wanted us to be in the right position to see the word Hallelujah amen he's put us in the right position to see the word amen so now if we are one of those Stars we say Lord may I carry my cross might be sold out amen may not be I will like like Lucifer said I will it's not I will but it's not no it should be not my will but thy will be done Lord amen so I'm going to leave that there okay but just as that preaches should not our lives preach speak as a church as a as families when people see you say this is something about you what makes you different well let's sit down I'll tell you who makes this different not what the Lord Jesus Christ makes us different this word this revealed word makes us different which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's be an array against the enemy every time against it comes against us
