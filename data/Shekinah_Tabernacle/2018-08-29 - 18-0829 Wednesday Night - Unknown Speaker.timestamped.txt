[25:04] everyone's had a good first part of the
[25:06] week I mean if you got your Bibles handy
[25:10] let's go to 2nd Peter chapter 3 like - I
[25:18] was meaning to get to this about a month
[25:21] ago finally we're here I mean I'd like
[25:24] to we're gonna read from first Peter 3
[25:29] from verse 1 down to down to verse 16
[25:34] they were to go to Zechariah chapter 4
[25:36] this is the second epistle beloved I now
[25:39] write unto you on both which I stir up
[25:42] your pure Minds by way of remembrance
[25:44] there you may be mindful of the words
[25:46] which were spoken before by the holy
[25:47] prophets and of the commandment of us
[25:50] the apostles of the Lord and Savior
[25:53] knowing this first that there shall come
[25:56] in the last days scoffers walking after
[25:59] their own lusts and saying where is the
[26:01] promise of us coming for since the
[26:03] father's fell asleep all things continue
[26:05] as they were from the beginning of the
[26:07] creation for this they willingly
[26:09] ignorant of that by the Word of God the
[26:13] heavens were of old and the earth
[26:14] standing out of the water and in the
[26:16] water
[26:17] whereby the world that then was being
[26:21] overflowed with water perished but the
[26:23] heavens and the earth which are now by
[26:25] the same word are kept in store reserved
[26:27] unto fire against the day of judgment
[26:30] and perdition of ungodly men but beloved
[26:32] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[26:34] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[26:37] years in a thousand years as one day the
[26:39] Lord is not slack concerning his promise
[26:41] as some men count slackness but is
[26:43] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[26:46] that any should perish but that all
[26:48] should come to repentance but the day of
[26:51] the Lord will come as a thief in the
[26:53] night in which the heavens shall pass
[26:55] away with a great noise and the elements
[26:57] shall melt with fervent heat the earth
[27:00] also in the works that are therein shall
[27:02] be burned up
[27:03] seeing then that all these things shall
[27:05] be dissolved what manner of persons
[27:07] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[27:09] in godliness looking for and hasting
[27:13] unto the coming of the day of God we are
[27:17] in the heaven shall be on fire oh we're
[27:19] in the heavens being on fire shall be
[27:20] dissolved and the elements shall melt
[27:22] with fervent heat nevertheless we
[27:24] according to his promise look for new
[27:27] heavens and a new earth ruined dwelleth
[27:29] righteousness
[27:30] wherefore beloved seeing that ye look
[27:32] for such things be diligent that ye may
[27:34] be found of him and peace without spot
[27:37] and blameless and account that the
[27:39] long-suffering of our Lord of salvation
[27:42] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[27:45] according to his wisdom giveth unto him
[27:47] hath written unto you and also in all
[27:50] his epistles speaking in them of these
[27:51] things in which are some things hard to
[27:54] be understood which they that are
[27:56] unlearned and unstable wrest as they do
[27:58] also the other scriptures unto their own
[28:01] destruction amen and let's go to the
[28:06] book of Zechariah chapter 4
[28:16] Sakurai for and verse 6 down to and
[28:20] we're gonna read down to verse 10 so CSU
[28:23] Zechariah 4 and verse 6 CC then he
[28:34] answered and spake unto me again saying
[28:36] this is the word of the lord unto
[28:38] jerusalem it-- nor by power but by my
[28:40] spirit saith the lord of hosts who art
[28:43] thou a great mountain before the before
[28:46] zerubabbel thou shall become a plain and
[28:49] he shall bring forth the headstone
[28:51] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[28:53] grace unto it moreover the word of the
[28:55] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[28:57] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[28:59] this house his hands shall also finish
[29:01] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[29:04] Hosts has sent me unto you for who hath
[29:07] despised the day of small things for
[29:09] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[29:12] plummet in the hands of Zerubbabel with
[29:14] those 7 they are the eyes of the Lord
[29:16] which run to and fro through the whole
[29:19] earth I mean let's bow our heads in a
[29:21] word of Prayer oh sweet Jesus take my
[29:25] life father take all its failings all
[29:28] that's right Lord take all of us Lord
[29:30] Jesus father may we just be vessels in
[29:32] your hand father of honor Lord that you
[29:35] can be glorified father we just want to
[29:37] commit this evening into your hands Lord
[29:39] I pray that you'll guide us in your word
[29:41] father may you take your word Lord and
[29:43] anoint it to every heart father we we
[29:46] are not here just to go through a motion
[29:48] of a service but will come to meet with
[29:49] you father Lord that you would speak to
[29:52] our hearts Lord you'd change us from
[29:53] glory to glory so father we just want to
[29:56] commit the service into your hands Lord
[29:57] be at those who couldn't be here tonight
[29:59] father
[30:00] fray you'd be their portion Lord and
[30:01] father help us to be attentive Lord and
[30:04] father may you just ooh Lord we want to
[30:06] touch the hem of your garment tonight so
[30:08] father may you grab the field glory we
[30:10] thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[30:13] I mean God bless you all you may have
[30:14] your seats this evening so I want to
[30:18] take a thought from where we're we're
[30:21] they asked at second Peter 3 & 4 season
[30:24] saying where is the promise of us coming
[30:26] now
[30:28] the coming of the Lord involves a union
[30:31] between God and man and we are living in
[30:35] a time as we read in Zechariah 4 where
[30:37] where Zach Araya is preaching we know
[30:42] he's he's a prophet to the to Israel as
[30:45] they're restoring the temple they're
[30:47] restoring Jerusalem and we know we know
[30:50] that zerubabbel was a was a prince among
[30:52] the people but it was also a prophetic
[30:54] word speaking of of zerubu being a type
[30:57] of Christ where Christ would build his
[30:59] church through seven Church ages and so
[31:02] he would take us as as Peter would say
[31:06] we are living stones we're lively stones
[31:08] built into the house of God where God
[31:11] would take us molds and shape us by his
[31:13] word and in places into the body and we
[31:15] are thankful that because I believe we
[31:18] are living where the last stones are
[31:19] being added to the building you know
[31:21] there's there's been seven ages this you
[31:23] know I've been every age you know God
[31:24] has sent a message to the aged and the
[31:26] people that have received that word was
[31:28] sealed into the kingdom under the
[31:30] messenger and then finally went down to
[31:31] this last age where the last few stones
[31:34] are being added and and it's really the
[31:37] greatest time to be alive where God and
[31:39] man are becoming one and this is the
[31:41] biggest sign thus biggest side to the
[31:43] earth in this present time as as God and
[31:47] his bride being United that is the sign
[31:51] to the earth wind because the because we
[31:53] are living in a harvest season where the
[31:55] grain is gathered to the garner amen we
[31:58] know the tears have been bound and
[31:59] they're they are being bound by a false
[32:01] anti Antichrist spirit but we know also
[32:04] that the wheat the the grain that God is
[32:07] looking for has been gathered into the
[32:08] gunner which is Christ and so the
[32:11] biggest sign you know we you know we
[32:13] look at you know we you know we look at
[32:15] Israel we know that's God's time peace
[32:17] brother Brown was told in a vision to
[32:19] Washington Russia watch the king of the
[32:20] north and you know we can watch Russia
[32:22] we can watch what America is doing we
[32:24] can watch you know what the Vatican is
[32:26] doing and what Israel is doing but all
[32:28] of that has its place but God is waiting
[32:31] for the last name on the book I mean to
[32:34] be dipped in blood brother Brown shares
[32:36] amen and then the planners wound up
[32:38] among the Gentiles so that's what God is
[32:40] his focus is upon
[32:42] you I mean God is very mindful of you as
[32:45] focuses upon you you are his timepiece
[32:47] at this time right because once once the
[32:50] pride has taken up into glory then he
[32:52] turns his attention fully to the Jews we
[32:54] know they're gathering there now you
[32:56] know the 144,000 probably are all there
[32:58] already they're there they're there
[33:00] waiting you know their felt felt a pull
[33:02] and they're reaping our return to their
[33:04] homeland and they're there but you know
[33:06] we have to get out of the way before he
[33:07] can go and and reveal himself to them
[33:11] amen so now the promise of us coming you
[33:14] know God is not slack but God is working
[33:16] in the lives of men and woman boys and
[33:18] girls around the earth
[33:19] amen that he would find those last ones
[33:22] that we can go home
[33:24] hallelujah so now God said that he will
[33:27] zerubabbel will lay the foundation of
[33:29] this of the of this house but also bring
[33:32] forth the headstone now the headstone we
[33:34] know as Christ right it's not a piece of
[33:36] masonry the headstone as a person right
[33:40] and then we see when this headstone
[33:42] comes to the body that the body cries
[33:44] out grace grace unto it because it's
[33:46] manifold its manifold grace in this age
[33:49] right there's greater grace than there's
[33:51] ever been in the in the history of the
[33:53] world because God because when the enemy
[33:55] comes in like a flood God raises up a
[33:58] standard so it raises up as grace he
[34:00] raises up as power and the people that
[34:02] they can overcome the works of the enemy
[34:05] hallelujah and that's why it's yo God's
[34:07] grace became amazing course because it's
[34:10] matter it's manifold greater grace than
[34:12] ever been that's right I mean cuz God's
[34:14] moved upon our hearts that that we love
[34:16] him more than anything else this world
[34:18] and all its shiny things the devil you
[34:20] know waves those shiny things in front
[34:22] of the bride's eyes but the bride her
[34:24] heart's upon her Lord the heart is upon
[34:26] the one hater who had is upon her
[34:29] Redeemer you know we're not too worried
[34:31] about this world hey you can have it all
[34:34] you can have it all you can play with
[34:36] that yes like a kitten some toys you can
[34:38] play with that one I've got heaven I've
[34:43] got our Lord oh I'll stay with him but
[34:45] scoffers will say well we are you know
[34:48] we we were promised coffers in these
[34:51] last days and they're here right so the
[34:54] promise of us coming now as men of
[34:56] in God and man becoming one now brother
[35:01] branham speaks well he he preaches a
[35:04] sermon which we call the statue of the
[35:06] perfect man but he doesn't call it the
[35:09] statue of the perfect man he says this
[35:11] morning we want to speak on the subject
[35:13] or teach rather if we can building the
[35:16] living Tabernacle building the living
[35:18] tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling
[35:20] place the perfect man that's what he
[35:23] calls it I like that title and she talks
[35:26] about building the living tabernacle of
[35:28] living God's dwelling place hallelujah
[35:31] you happen to be that dwelling place I
[35:33] mean so God has God has sent his word
[35:35] upon the earth to molds and shape us and
[35:38] to into his very image now we're going
[35:42] to do a quick study and to because in
[35:44] the scripture there's a statue of the
[35:45] perfect man there's also the statue of
[35:48] the anti perfect man so we're gonna read
[35:51] both these let's go to 2nd Peter 1 now
[35:54] this is all familiar to most of us then
[35:56] we're going to go into and now that
[35:59] another part of the scripture but so
[36:03] second Peter in verse 1 Simon Peter a
[36:10] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[36:14] to them that are obtained like precious
[36:15] faith with us through the righteousness
[36:18] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace
[36:22] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[36:23] the knowledge of God Anabelle and end of
[36:26] Jesus our Lord according as his divine
[36:28] power hath given unto us all things that
[36:32] pertain unto life and godliness through
[36:35] the knowledge of him that has called us
[36:38] called us to glory and virtue amen
[36:42] whereby a given unto us exceeding great
[36:45] and precious promises that by these you
[36:48] might be partakers of the divine nature
[36:51] having escaped the corruption that is in
[36:54] the world through lust I mean so so he's
[36:57] addressing this to you this is this is
[37:00] to you okay and besides this giving all
[37:03] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[37:05] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[37:08] temperance and you
[37:09] temperance patience and to patience
[37:11] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[37:14] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[37:16] charity charity is divine love for if
[37:20] these things be in you and abound you
[37:22] they make you they make you that you
[37:26] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[37:28] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[37:31] Christ but he that lacketh these things
[37:34] is blind and cannot see afar off and has
[37:36] forgotten that he was purged from his
[37:39] old sins wherefore the rather brethren
[37:42] give diligence to make your calling
[37:44] election sure for if you do these things
[37:47] you shall never fail Amen now God puts
[37:52] these virtues in his bride
[37:53] it takes the manifestation of the word
[37:56] to bring these virtues into his bride
[37:58] right this is not this is not you
[38:01] yourself physically adding these things
[38:03] right God gives faith God faith is
[38:05] revelation right it's revealed God
[38:07] sovereignly reveals himself to you that
[38:09] gives you faith where it goes beyond a
[38:11] human faith - I believe it can be done
[38:14] - a revealed faith that you know it can
[38:16] be done right David David's there I mean
[38:19] we'll run let's let's go back a step
[38:21] Israel's on one side the valley
[38:23] Philistines are on the other side
[38:24] Goliath comes out Max's boast brother
[38:27] Brahim sees and fakes faith as works
[38:29] expressed he says the Israelite army
[38:31] knew it could be done right they knew
[38:34] that Goliath could be defeated in their
[38:36] mind they knew it could be done
[38:38] but David knew it could be done in his
[38:40] heart it was revealed to him that he
[38:42] would kill the giant right sores
[38:45] so the Israelite army it was human faith
[38:47] they knew it could be done but to David
[38:49] it was revealed that's why he went down
[38:51] there and he defeated his enemy because
[38:53] he knew it could be done so there's the
[38:54] kind of faith I'm talking about what God
[38:56] reveals himself to you makes himself
[38:58] real to you right and then so all these
[39:01] virtues are built into you by the
[39:04] manifestation of his word case this is
[39:07] God building you into this image where
[39:09] once we were not made in this image but
[39:11] he builds us up right and the capstone
[39:13] is charity divine love which is Jesus
[39:16] Christ the Holy Ghost world's puts all
[39:18] these virtues into you amen now I don't
[39:21] want to dwell too much on that but
[39:23] that's the statue of the perfect man I
[39:25] mean we have faith right and then we
[39:29] have virtue with your strength Jesus
[39:30] when the woman touched his garments and
[39:32] I perceive virtue has come out of me
[39:35] right and knowledge knowledge of his
[39:37] word that's why we need Holy Ghost
[39:38] knowledge of the scripture when the
[39:41] enemy comes against you then God brings
[39:43] his word forth into your mind
[39:44] they even combat him right and
[39:46] temperance temperance temperance is if
[39:49] the enemy comes against you don't fly
[39:51] off the handle yeah
[39:52] amen you can stand there in a godly way
[39:55] Luo Yin patience I mean faith worketh
[39:58] patience right now I mean patience
[40:01] knowing God will fulfill his word in a
[40:03] season amen and patience godliness to be
[40:07] like God right and in brotherly kindness
[40:10] and to brotherly kindness charity we're
[40:13] living in a day where all these virtues
[40:14] are in the people and I'll say we're not
[40:17] looking for it to come it's already here
[40:19] there's so much you know we're we're so
[40:21] much right at the end you know our next
[40:24] destination is a rapture
[40:25] you know we are living in a resurrection
[40:27] season we're know looking afar off when
[40:29] shall these things be Lord we're
[40:31] actually pretty much look in the
[40:33] rearview mirror it's already happened so
[40:36] now we are actually coming under this
[40:39] message of the hour god quicken air to
[40:41] your soul he puts these virtues in your
[40:43] life I mean like Moses before he met the
[40:46] Lord on on your you're at the burning
[40:49] bush rather he was he was in fearest he
[40:52] was raised in Pharaoh's house he was the
[40:54] Pharaoh was God in Egypt what kind of
[40:57] way do you think he carried himself
[40:58] around how are you today you know he
[41:03] wasn't like that he was Pharaoh he was
[41:05] the next Pharaoh it was a god it's more
[41:08] than the people you know and and the and
[41:11] the royalty led the army into battle so
[41:14] what do you how do you think he would
[41:15] have been before he led his people into
[41:17] battle he would have been to make a
[41:18] little fellow he's I know we're gonna go
[41:20] slaughter these people he would have
[41:22] jumped on the chariot follow me boys
[41:23] I'll show you how it's done
[41:24] but after he met the Lord in the burning
[41:28] bush he wrote about himself it was God
[41:30] writing about him he became the meekest
[41:32] man in all the
[41:32] because that word that law became a
[41:35] revelation to them and then it produced
[41:37] the character of Christ in his life
[41:39] right the scribes and Pharisees they
[41:41] didn't it was a revelation the law
[41:43] wasn't a revelation him they learnt it
[41:45] and they became proud and arrogant
[41:46] people I mean so when the word becomes a
[41:49] revelation it produces a character
[41:52] hallelujah I'm glad God's quickening us
[41:55] word to us producing his character in
[41:58] our lives amen of course you got to give
[42:00] yourself to him that he molds and shakes
[42:02] you sure but when the word when it when
[42:04] it becomes a revelation of producers
[42:06] character Alleluia so now the capstone
[42:09] that we have received is charity divine
[42:12] love the bride has already received her
[42:15] capstone hallelujah amen
[42:19] so now that is the statue in a very
[42:21] small nutshell of a perfect man now
[42:25] we're going to look at the statue of the
[42:26] eye called the anti perfect man let's go
[42:29] to proverbs 6
[42:43] proverbs 6 and 16
[42:50] I'm gonna read down to verse 19 sees
[42:53] here these six things that the Lord
[42:56] hates yes seven are an abomination unto
[42:58] Him a proud look a lying tongue and
[43:01] hands that shed innocent blood a heart
[43:04] that devises wicked imaginations feet
[43:07] that be swift and running to mischief a
[43:09] false witness that speaketh lies and he
[43:12] that soweth discord among brethren so
[43:16] brotherly kindness discord among
[43:18] brethren is the two opposite but now we
[43:20] need to see what's the capstone of this
[43:23] anti perfect man let's go to proverbs 26
[43:30] i'll go from verse 24 it says he that
[43:37] hateth dissemble earth with his lips and
[43:41] lathe up deceit within him when he
[43:45] speaketh fear believe him not there are
[43:47] seven abominations in his heart we just
[43:49] read about seven abominations in his
[43:51] heart whose hatred this is the capstone
[43:53] is covered by deceit his wickedness
[43:56] shall be showed before the whole
[43:58] congregation amen
[44:01] that's the capstone of the anti perfect
[44:03] man so one's got divine love one has
[44:06] hatred they meant one has hatred covered
[44:10] by deceit that's the two these two are
[44:14] upon the earth right now amen
[44:17] the Easter upon the earth now what has
[44:21] this got to do with the promise of us
[44:23] coming and God becoming one with the
[44:26] people well we're in a harvest season
[44:29] now a harvest season is very important
[44:32] in the scripture and we happen to be the
[44:35] harvest right gods are looking for
[44:37] barley natural barley natural wheat he's
[44:38] looking for people he's looking for his
[44:40] children he's going together as children
[44:42] to himself
[44:43] now when God when God has a harvest he
[44:47] has a way that the harvest is is is
[44:50] harvested and the first part of the
[44:53] harvest
[44:54] is cut down and waived by the priest
[44:58] before the Lord where as a wave sheaf
[45:01] which is the first fruit to the harvest
[45:02] which the priest waves there's in
[45:05] Leviticus 23:10 to 12 and it's waved
[45:08] before it's it's waved on the day after
[45:12] the Sabbath by the priest and Azrael
[45:15] thanking thanking God saying thank you
[45:17] the rest of the field will become like
[45:19] this one I mean because if you look at a
[45:22] wheat field like any plant different
[45:23] plants grow at different rates right so
[45:26] it takes a while but eventually the
[45:29] whole field becomes golden the whole
[45:31] field at first there's some part golden
[45:34] some are still green some are still
[45:35] growing depending on what part of the
[45:37] field they're in but eventually they all
[45:38] become to the same maturity and then the
[45:41] harvest comes but before the harvest
[45:42] comes the first fruit of the field is
[45:44] cut down and it's waived by the priest
[45:47] before the Lord saying thank you Lord
[45:49] that the rest of the of the ones in the
[45:51] field will be exactly manifested like
[45:53] this one now God is looking for a people
[45:57] who are exactly like him
[45:58] yes right when a when you know like
[46:02] Mary's like right
[46:04] humans marry humans men marry woman
[46:07] right we don't marry at a different
[46:09] species right we marry like that's the
[46:12] law of marriage you know and so now if
[46:15] God is if God is if God is going to
[46:20] marry someone he's going to marry the
[46:21] feminist part of himself right he's not
[46:24] going to marry anything else he's gonna
[46:25] marry mrs. Jesus Christ that's that's
[46:29] how he's marrying that's who he's United
[46:30] with already and if he's going to
[46:33] harvest now Jesus spake of himself he
[46:36] said unless a corner of wheat falls to
[46:38] the ground at a buys you know abides
[46:40] alone but if it does a force to the
[46:42] ground then it brings forth much fruit
[46:44] so he was the first fruit to the
[46:46] resurrection right he was the
[46:48] firstfruits of the resurrection and so
[46:50] what happened was he was cut down and
[46:53] then he was waived the life was waived
[46:56] over the people that the people that
[46:59] have been listening to the spoken word
[47:01] for three and a half years of his
[47:02] ministry his disciples were gathered to
[47:05] him and they were listening to
[47:07] spoken-word right and it begin to impact
[47:10] their life and grip them Peter said to
[47:12] whom shall we go thou alone has the
[47:14] words of eternal life
[47:15] they were gripped by a spoken word
[47:17] spoken by the Messiah right and then so
[47:20] they were gathered and then so what they
[47:22] were observing was eternal life on
[47:26] display
[47:27] God was in flesh and God gathered them
[47:30] his disciples because he wanted to open
[47:32] a world to them an unseen world he
[47:35] wanted them to see there is a real
[47:36] heaven there are angels
[47:39] there's also devils and there's hell he
[47:42] want to open the whole world this is
[47:43] what sickness really is this is what the
[47:45] enemy does in the religious realm and
[47:48] the physical realm sickness you know
[47:50] your sickness is the physical robbed you
[47:52] want to show what all these things are
[47:53] and they want to show now I have
[47:55] dominion over the devil
[47:57] I've dominion over the religious realm I
[47:59] have dominion over the flesh I've
[48:01] dominion over the grave I'm gonna show
[48:03] you that I have two men you know of
[48:04] everything he's wanting him to see this
[48:06] because he does not want to God does not
[48:09] want to just be next to us he wants to
[48:11] live that same life through us right
[48:14] that's where he gathered the disciples
[48:16] because he was gonna go in them and live
[48:19] the same life hallelujah so now he was
[48:22] cut down that life was waved over people
[48:25] of their Pentecost hallelujah and God
[48:29] used that as a memorial
[48:31] when the Old Testament was a memorial
[48:33] because Israel was thanking God that is
[48:36] rest in the field who'll come exactly
[48:38] forth like the first one right now you
[48:41] are planted in the field the field is
[48:43] the world Jesus said in the parable so
[48:46] God when Jesus was cut down and he was
[48:48] waved over the people God was saying
[48:50] there's more in the field like this one
[48:52] and they will come forth exactly in the
[48:55] same way with the same life I'm in the
[48:59] same size the same wonders the same
[49:01] manifestation of the word will now be in
[49:03] a mere multi-member body Alleluia Jesus
[49:10] Jesus gathered them now I thank God we
[49:18] don't just talk about
[49:19] I thank God this message is not theory I
[49:23] thank God that it's not an idea I thank
[49:27] God that Jesus is not just an idea he's
[49:29] a living being I thank God he's not just
[49:32] a God of history
[49:33] I thank God he's not just a God of the
[49:35] future I thank God you know how brother
[49:38] brems rallying cry was Jesus Christ the
[49:41] same yesterday today and forever
[49:45] and the reason he dramatized the
[49:46] scripture so much as you want to make it
[49:48] alive not just he's so much of an
[49:50] envision they want you to he wanted it
[49:53] to become alive a present day this is
[49:55] where you are you know hallelujah and so
[49:58] I thank God that Jesus the Spirit of
[50:02] Truth and he took me on Sunday he's a
[50:04] person and he's present Alleluia and
[50:07] he's present cause he knows that you're
[50:09] in the field he wanted you to come for
[50:11] Amen like Jesus did like he did I'm in
[50:15] Genesis 1 and 1 darkness you know
[50:17] darkness covered the face of the deep
[50:19] and the Spirit of God moved upon Oh
[50:21] Genesis 1 and 2 amen
[50:23] darkness covered the world then the
[50:25] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[50:27] waters here the purpose of doing it
[50:30] because they were seen under that waters
[50:32] their seed in the earth already but he
[50:34] had to separate light and darkness the
[50:36] spoke at y'all God Himself brooded over
[50:38] the earth because he wanted to bring
[50:39] forth seats hallelujah that were there
[50:42] and that's why he brooded over you Amen
[50:45] he brooded over he did you I mean we're
[50:48] not here haphazardly God's wanting you
[50:50] to recognize there's a life that I want
[50:52] to manifest in you holy it's more than
[50:55] your natural life it's supernatural life
[50:56] Amen she brooded over you ship red light
[50:59] from darkness that a life would come
[51:01] forth Amen Alleluia the brother Bram
[51:05] says that you're the first day the first
[51:08] light to ever strike the world was was
[51:11] God's supernatural light and he said
[51:14] that was a very incredible Sun rising
[51:16] but it was nothing compared to the
[51:19] resurrection the Sunday morning when
[51:22] Jesus rose it was not just the issue and
[51:24] issue in rising as the eson the Son of
[51:28] God rising hallelujah that he would come
[51:31] forth
[51:33] to bring forth more seats you think
[51:36] about when when when someone plants a a
[51:39] garden or whatever there you go there

[52:14] the east are we in rising that's why
[52:17] there's an atmosphere in this place
[52:19] lujah this is not a freezer this is not
[52:23] a chiller this is a place this is a
[52:26] greenhouse only that life can come for
[52:29] is all about atmosphere life can come
[52:32] forth early that's why the sun's rising
[52:35] I'll say the Sun is here no he says it's
[52:41] not the issue in anymore CSO nday the
[52:44] Sunday at a corner of week God's first
[52:48] one up from the dead is to be waved over
[52:49] the congregation that we are his seed
[52:52] and that's the first of the seed of
[52:54] those that slipped waved upon the first
[52:56] day of the week on Sunday he raised up
[52:59] waved goodbye and ascended on high in
[53:01] the presence of the people notice it was
[53:03] the first corner of God's wheat that had
[53:05] been raised from the dead God's first
[53:07] corn of wheat by God's quickening power
[53:09] God had quickened his life raised him up
[53:12] from the dead and he was the first
[53:14] fruits of those that slept the first
[53:17] fruit he was that sheath and that's why
[53:19] they had to waive that sheath was it was
[53:23] the first one that come to maturity and
[53:25] it was waived as a memorial of
[53:27] Thanksgiving to God believing that the
[53:30] rest of them would come it was a sign it
[53:33] was a sign and today because he was the
[53:37] first son of God to come to full
[53:39] maturity to be in God he was plucked up
[53:42] from the earth and waved over the people
[53:44] he says what a glorious lesson
[53:46] by the quickening power the first one
[53:48] although he had been tight too many
[53:50] times as we'll see later that he was
[53:52] typed but this was really the first
[53:54] fruit of them that slept he was then
[53:57] waved over the promised seed that had
[53:59] that had promise of life he was waved in
[54:03] the day of Pentecost when there came for
[54:06] the south from heaven like a way like a
[54:08] waving mighty rushing wind and was waved
[54:10] over the people the Pentecostal people
[54:12] that was up at Pentecost waiting for the
[54:15] blessing to come and to be waved again
[54:17] we realized in the last day according to
[54:20] Luke 1730 in the Esso in day again and
[54:24] the day that the eson of man will be
[54:26] revealed or waved again over the people
[54:28] now who was the Son of Man in the
[54:30] beginning was the word and the Word was
[54:32] with God in the Word was God and the
[54:34] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[54:36] and if the teaching I mean sorry I know
[54:38] for all the teaching that we have and
[54:39] the confirmation of the Word of God by
[54:42] the Word of God by signs by wonders we
[54:44] see today that in the Book of Luke here
[54:46] that we just quoted from Luke the
[54:48] seventeenth chapter thirty at first and
[54:50] Malachi for the different scriptures
[54:52] that we are acquainted with that that
[54:54] word again is waved over the people that
[54:56] the dead traditions of manners did and
[54:59] the Son of God is alive again with the
[55:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us
[55:03] and giving us life he's saying this is
[55:06] waved over the people this ministry he
[55:08] said this ministry is being waved over
[55:10] the people God again like on the day of
[55:12] Pentecost is being waved over the people
[55:15] amen hey so so what's happening is
[55:18] there's a display of life of eternal
[55:21] life Alleluia and now a lot of people
[55:25] saw the display of eternal life it
[55:27] didn't mean a lot to them just like I
[55:29] say if you if you plant seed and then it
[55:32] comes through the spring time say you've
[55:34] planted wheat in the field now that
[55:36] sunrise you want it to quicken the wheat
[55:39] it doesn't quicken it doesn't bring to
[55:41] life the dirt or the rocks or or
[55:45] whatever more it may bring forth some
[55:47] weeds but those get plugged out
[55:48] eventually right but you know it's not
[55:51] the Sun isn't there to bring the rocks
[55:53] to life there's no life in the rock
[55:54] there's no life in the dirt itself it's
[55:57] the seats that are laying there under
[55:59] that dirt
[55:59] they come to life hallelujah and it's
[56:02] the same thing with you and I phrased
[56:04] this this word our Lord Jesus he is the
[56:06] word when I say this word I mean our
[56:09] Lord Jesus right
[56:10] he's been waived he's come out of
[56:12] history I'm not just talking about 1965
[56:15] this message still lives he is still
[56:18] alive
[56:18] he's been waived hallelujah and a lot of
[56:21] people looked at see that's fanaticism
[56:23] that's false that's whatever but
[56:25] something in the believer says that's
[56:26] for me
[56:27] holy sang-soo's I'm going to come forth
[56:29] of that image hallelujah and God's
[56:31] making a promise
[56:32] they're gonna come forth like this one
[56:34] probably I'll just wave this for a while
[56:36] Lena come forth like this one
[56:38] following this seeds in the field
[56:40] thinking to manifest this the life
[56:42] that's in the word is going to be
[56:43] manifested in them because they're the
[56:45] same seed as as this is hallelujah
[56:51] brother brahim sees that was from the
[56:55] rising of the Sun you should go listen
[56:56] to her if you want to hear a message he
[56:58] doesn't say is it the rising of the Sun
[57:00] question mark he says it is the rising
[57:03] of the Sun the Sun has risen and we can
[57:06] say that because we've beneficiaries of
[57:08] that Sun raising I mean we've felt the
[57:10] impact of the Sun race hallelujah have
[57:13] you been quick Andy be made alive has it
[57:16] changed you what's happening cuz the
[57:17] sun's risen and it's shining it all
[57:22] depends where you are if you're
[57:23] somewhere else where it's dark you'd say
[57:26] it's not shining here he say just move
[57:27] location Olu you'll feel some sun rays
[57:30] now Jesus manifested eternal life and so
[57:36] the bride will manifest the same word
[57:37] life as he did romance says now and as
[57:41] we being the groom and he saw as he
[57:43] being the groom the bride has to come
[57:45] forth because it's part of him and it
[57:47] can only be the manifestation of the
[57:49] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[57:51] others has spoken of the bride it can
[57:54] only manifest if it does something
[57:56] different from the groom it isn't the
[57:58] bride the same life that was in him is
[58:01] in her because they are one I mean
[58:05] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[58:07] of his bone life was life power was
[58:09] power she is him
[58:10] as a man a woman a one and the woman
[58:13] taken from her side she has taken a
[58:15] spirit the feminist spirit from him the
[58:17] flesh from his side made both mechanics
[58:21] and dynamics the wife the spirit of him
[58:23] in the flesh of him and put it together
[58:25] and made mechanics and dynamics
[58:27] hallelujah now what do you mean by
[58:30] mechanics and dynamics it's just not
[58:33] mechanics of a framework we're going to
[58:35] talk about like two Cadillacs that come
[58:36] off the assembly line they can be
[58:38] perfect but if one doesn't have the
[58:40] spark plug it's not moving the only way
[58:44] you can prove that that car works is if
[58:46] you turn on the ignition and that's the
[58:48] only way you can prove the gasoline and
[58:49] the tank is gasoline right you can say
[58:52] oh it's the best octane look we have all
[58:54] the scientific reports and whatever more
[58:55] well then you say prove it there's only
[58:58] one way the key in the ignition and if
[59:02] the and if the ignition doesn't go
[59:03] there's something wrong you can't prove
[59:05] it's gasoline right but I thank God his
[59:08] word is gasoline right his word this
[59:11] message his word is gasoline right but
[59:13] you got to have the spark of the Holy
[59:15] Ghost in you I need to make you go down
[59:17] the road I mean to prove that is
[59:19] gasoline hallelujah but I thank God now
[59:22] that we just don't have mechanics we
[59:24] have the dynamics even the dynamics of
[59:27] the word the Holy Ghost coming into the
[59:29] word my kid live that's what we have
[59:31] that's the proof of the pudding that
[59:33] it's a Cadillac hallelujah that's the
[59:35] purpose of putting this thing back she
[59:37] goes as I said before I thank God is not
[59:40] just theory right it's a living reality
[59:42] he is a living reality in his bride I
[59:46] mean when we talk about Jesus we're not
[59:48] talking about someone that we don't know
[59:49] right we don't talk about someone that's
[59:52] just an idea amen we talk about someone
[59:56] with me he's changed our life story book
[59:59] Hey Alleluia we have the mechanics the
[1:00:04] bride will have both mechanics and
[1:00:05] dynamics amen
[1:00:08] because she is flesh flesh life is life
[1:00:11] power of his power she is him so
[1:00:13] everything he did she will do right the
[1:00:16] life he lives she will live hallelujah
[1:00:20] amen now
[1:00:23] the mechanics now he says until that
[1:00:28] church becomes both dynamics and
[1:00:30] mechanics and the Spirit of God that
[1:00:32] moved him to do the things he did if he
[1:00:34] hit on 16 cylinders so will the brave
[1:00:37] Amen for he said in John 14:12 he that
[1:00:41] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:00:42] shall he do also
[1:00:44] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics
[1:00:46] and his mechanics that the world will
[1:00:48] not be able to withstand it and I'll
[1:00:51] raise them up again at the last day
[1:00:52] that's the Easter message the dynamics
[1:00:55] and the mechanics together the mechanics
[1:00:57] without the dynamics is no good neither
[1:00:59] is the dynamics without the mechanics
[1:01:01] you can scream and shout and jump up and
[1:01:03] down all you want to and deny this word
[1:01:05] it won't do any good
[1:01:06] you're just cranking around Pistons
[1:01:08] you've got a spark there to fire but no
[1:01:10] gasoline to fire it by it'll only work
[1:01:13] as they come together amen so no one
[1:01:16] will will sit still and the other one
[1:01:19] will go up there's the only thing there
[1:01:21] is yet yet we they both might look alike
[1:01:24] they both claim to be churches both
[1:01:27] paying to be a bride but one has
[1:01:28] mechanics and dynamics it'll it brings
[1:01:32] the past of what he said is the truth
[1:01:35] hallelujah hallelujah I trust if
[1:01:38] something and you saying that sounds
[1:01:40] like me Amen I'm one of them I'm one of
[1:01:44] them
[1:01:45] I'm so glad I can say I've got the
[1:01:47] mechanics and dynamics home that's not
[1:01:51] big you know if I was King uh you know
[1:01:54] if I was the prisoner United States I'd
[1:01:56] say I'm the president you know and you'd
[1:01:59] say and no one say you're being proud of
[1:02:00] just be I wouldn't be I've got elected
[1:02:02] here I am I find myself in this office a
[1:02:04] man the public has put me in now if God
[1:02:08] has elected me before the foundation of
[1:02:10] the world to be his bride if he said
[1:02:13] cheese he is gonna be part of her amen
[1:02:16] well I'll just say this is who I am
[1:02:19] this is who I am I can't help but he's
[1:02:21] made me this hallelujah and if you
[1:02:24] really have a bride you want to be proud
[1:02:26] about it you just be all how did I get
[1:02:28] into this place
[1:02:29] well Leah by His grace grace grace was
[1:02:32] chatting Polly see the headstone come
[1:02:35] down upon your life you cry grace grace
[1:02:37] hallelujah God's grace amen now it won't
[1:02:46] move no matter how good the mechanics is
[1:02:48] until the dynamics come when the
[1:02:50] dynamics come that fire is made to
[1:02:52] connect with that octane and the
[1:02:53] gasoline and when that explodes it
[1:02:55] causes the combustion and that
[1:02:57] combustion moves every motion every move
[1:02:59] for here's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:01] forever
[1:03:02] that's the resurrection that's the real
[1:03:03] power of God mechanics with dynamics
[1:03:06] I mean notice it's a spirit that
[1:03:08] quickeneth it's the spark that fires
[1:03:10] it's not the gas it fires it's the spark
[1:03:12] that fires the gas see I mean you can do
[1:03:16] nothing without me but with me you can
[1:03:18] do all things as he is the word it's the
[1:03:21] father living father sent me so send are
[1:03:23] you as the father has fired me and
[1:03:25] pushed me into everything I do only that
[1:03:27] which is pleasing to God now as he sent
[1:03:29] me so send I you with the same mechanics
[1:03:32] and it takes the same dynamics to
[1:03:34] operate it and these signs shall follow
[1:03:36] them that claim to have the mechanics by
[1:03:38] the the dynamics will take its place for
[1:03:41] Paul said the gospel came to us not
[1:03:43] inward only through gasoline-only but
[1:03:46] through spark also it'll make it move
[1:03:49] there you are it came to us in that
[1:03:51] manner hallelujah now there has been a
[1:03:57] uniting going on amen we as I said we're
[1:04:01] not looking for it to come it's already
[1:04:03] happened the Bride of Christ has become
[1:04:06] one holy or where he has come and he
[1:04:09] comes and dwells in you where you become
[1:04:11] the living tabernacle of living God's
[1:04:13] dwelling place hallelujah that's a good
[1:04:16] description of uh of the bride amen you
[1:04:19] are the living Tabernacle living God's
[1:04:21] dwelling place now he says in Christ a
[1:04:26] mystery God revealed he says that we
[1:04:29] have the devil's answer
[1:04:31] we have the devil's eyes of the devil
[1:04:33] asks a lot of questions is this really
[1:04:35] real does it really work who says this
[1:04:38] is true I said we have the answer it
[1:04:41] says we have the devil's answer Christ
[1:04:43] is risen among us the bride has the
[1:04:46] devil's answer me holy and we can say we
[1:04:49] had the life of God I mean that is the
[1:04:51] devil's answer I mean we're and that
[1:04:53] actually makes some shut up holy because
[1:04:56] we have a living God on display amen now
[1:05:02] he sees here in Christ his mystery god
[1:05:05] now now I see mister brother Chris
[1:05:07] brother I'll share it with you and his
[1:05:10] church stands alone she has not hooked
[1:05:12] with nothing but he was identified by
[1:05:14] God being the body that God dwelt in and
[1:05:17] the church was identified by his body
[1:05:19] doing the same thing she is his body the
[1:05:22] manifested truth of his promised word
[1:05:25] for these last days I'm talking about
[1:05:28] you and she and she alone stands by it
[1:05:31] now he says that's why the devil's
[1:05:33] howling these great organizations to set
[1:05:35] up something to close her up
[1:05:37] they'll never do it she'll be taken up
[1:05:39] not closed up I mean she is now risen
[1:05:42] and by the power of the vindicated word
[1:05:44] promise to her amen how a bride holds
[1:05:47] that promise he told me he would return
[1:05:50] after me I believe in our yes sir to
[1:05:52] meet her headship her Redeemer her
[1:05:54] husband her king who lured her love of
[1:05:56] her Savior and the provided meeting
[1:05:58] place which is the meeting in the air I
[1:06:00] mean so the devil won't close her up
[1:06:03] she'll be taken up hallelujah that's why
[1:06:06] I say let's just keep pounding this
[1:06:08] through
[1:06:08] they keep living a life for God the
[1:06:11] devil can't close us up you think you
[1:06:13] think the Apostle Paul was closed up
[1:06:15] hallelujah he was beaten he was
[1:06:18] shipwrecked here's whatever he ended up
[1:06:19] in prison
[1:06:20] amen they didn't close him up hallelujah
[1:06:24] he went preaching all the same it's like
[1:06:26] they you know you know you're the
[1:06:28] Apostle John God needed him on the Isle
[1:06:31] of Patmos to receive through a
[1:06:32] revelation you know sometimes the devil
[1:06:35] thinks well I've got them in a corner
[1:06:37] and God saying I need them in that
[1:06:38] corner hallelujah because I'm going to
[1:06:41] show myself to them
[1:06:42] you know the devil has your the devil is
[1:06:44] just a tool in the hands of God to get
[1:06:47] you where you need to be that's all he
[1:06:49] is is a tool he said weighs on my case
[1:06:52] hallelujah God's working I didn't call
[1:06:55] the devil God now you understand what I
[1:06:57] mean right but the devil is just a tool
[1:06:59] in the hands of God we do not need to
[1:07:02] fear Him
[1:07:03] all things work together for good for
[1:07:05] those that love him and are called
[1:07:08] according to his purpose
[1:07:10] amen and we know we were called
[1:07:12] according to his purpose because a wave
[1:07:14] sheaf has been waived he has been waived
[1:07:17] and something that you see as oh I can
[1:07:19] identify with that one I can identify
[1:07:21] with this message
[1:07:22] I identify with this Living Word so the
[1:07:25] menu says that's me Harley just like the
[1:07:27] eagle and the chicken coop you know the
[1:07:30] chickens there's something because
[1:07:32] chickens are prey they get scared when a
[1:07:34] predator comes around but an eagle is
[1:07:36] not a prey item it's a predator sees the
[1:07:40] chicken and the barnyard doing this
[1:07:41] trying to be a chicken
[1:07:43] you know a believer is a very poor
[1:07:44] unbeliever you know you know an
[1:07:48] unbeliever can pretend to be a believer
[1:07:50] it doesn't really work but you can take
[1:07:53] it the other way around
[1:07:54] you know we never really fit in the
[1:07:55] world hallelujah we really never had a
[1:07:58] place where I felt out of place I trust
[1:08:01] you dude
[1:08:01] why because you never really wouldn't
[1:08:03] we're a good unbeliever or even a good
[1:08:05] make believer because you're a believer
[1:08:07] and believers believe that's what they
[1:08:09] do it's like the eagle and the chicken
[1:08:10] coop he wasn't a very good chicken he
[1:08:13] tried he scratched had these bugs oh I'm
[1:08:17] sick of these bugs but it's all he knew
[1:08:19] was bugs and worms and Mama hens having
[1:08:22] a Jubilee in the little whatever little
[1:08:24] chickens but something mmm says
[1:08:25] something's not right here
[1:08:27] wasn't that a wonderful feast we head
[1:08:31] and something and the eagle chickens
[1:08:34] yeah yeah yeah yeah but in this house I
[1:08:36] no no no you know oh that was a glorious
[1:08:40] time yeah yeah no no no really yeah but
[1:08:44] you want to say I mean yeah you do where
[1:08:45] you say yeah because you want to fit him
[1:08:46] but in your house like no not really
[1:08:48] it's not my satisfying portion and there
[1:08:50] it was picking around and the mama knew
[1:08:54] she laid two eggs
[1:08:55] he comes the dynamics the mechanics is
[1:08:57] on the ground right he comes the
[1:08:59] dynamics looking for the mechanics she
[1:09:01] saw God found you God was hunting you
[1:09:05] doesn't matter if you're raised in
[1:09:06] church God was hunting you and your
[1:09:08] season he found you although he was
[1:09:11] soaring soaring maybe that ego was
[1:09:15] sinking where I might just go and get a
[1:09:16] get a takeaway meal something but then
[1:09:21] he bit in right well brother ben says
[1:09:23] mama mama look down and so that's not a
[1:09:25] chicken that's part of me that's part of
[1:09:29] me Oh hallelujah I've been looking for
[1:09:31] this one I knew it was there somewhere
[1:09:33] and here it is and then all the chickens
[1:09:36] they see maybe the shadow of the Eagle
[1:09:39] comes over there they panic they flee to
[1:09:41] the coop but then there's this little
[1:09:43] baby eagle and the and the Mama Eagle
[1:09:45] shadow goes over it looks up it's not
[1:09:49] scared
[1:09:52] mmm it looks familiar
[1:09:55] I don't know how um what am I not scared
[1:09:59] of that get the devil fleece from this
[1:10:01] word but the believer sees there's
[1:10:03] something about this thing yeah yeah
[1:10:05] something about this Living God
[1:10:07] I'll Lou you that that that that meets
[1:10:09] some kind of desire in them and then the
[1:10:12] baby will looks up it's not scared
[1:10:14] because remember it's a predator - right
[1:10:17] it's part of mama holy it's not a prey
[1:10:19] item yeah and maybe they're under the
[1:10:21] coop saying you know all panicking oh I
[1:10:25] get it
[1:10:26] yo get in you're gonna hit eatin but the
[1:10:28] moment yeah but the babysit you get away
[1:10:30] from this word at all it's funny oh oh
[1:10:34] it'll kill you I'll bring it in today's
[1:10:38] yeah here we are
[1:10:39] yeah but then the baby just says no
[1:10:42] that's and the mama looks down screams
[1:10:45] now if a you know if a predator screams
[1:10:50] at a prey item that proud and gets
[1:10:52] scared but the eagle baby wasn't a prey
[1:10:55] item and something resonated in it's all
[1:10:58] set soul that sounds like it fits me
[1:11:02] hallelujah and there's this word just
[1:11:05] like Jesus preached
[1:11:06] many people it resonated to a furor
[1:11:09] gripped a few to whom shall we go thou
[1:11:11] learn of the words of eternal life the
[1:11:14] scribes and Pharisees said this is
[1:11:15] Beelzebub there's two very different
[1:11:17] opinions they heard the same word
[1:11:19] because one was chicken one was eagle
[1:11:22] hallelujah I mean so there's the baby
[1:11:24] and she hears the scream and then and
[1:11:27] then now when it's like how do I get up
[1:11:28] there hallelujah
[1:11:31] there's something when he comes your way
[1:11:33] and you're oh Lord how do I get there I
[1:11:35] got this burden of sin I can't fly up
[1:11:37] there and he says I'm taking care of
[1:11:39] that just give it to me Oh Cassie you
[1:11:41] see my forgetfulness and then the mother
[1:11:44] says just flap your wings gets up to the
[1:11:46] fencepost Howley it's off the ground but
[1:11:48] it's not quite off the ground keep keep
[1:11:50] flexing those faith muscles there's
[1:11:53] something in the bride that must be in
[1:11:55] the heavenlies with our Lord you you
[1:11:57] can't stop it there's a death call us to
[1:12:00] the beach and there's more than a nice
[1:12:01] scripture that's a reality there's a big
[1:12:04] callings of God I must be in heaven with
[1:12:06] you I must walk streets of gold I must
[1:12:09] put the crown on your head at your feet
[1:12:12] follow us all God I want to worship you
[1:12:16] there I want to see you hallelujah is
[1:12:23] just like I said on Sunday you didn't
[1:12:25] choose him he chose you he chose you and
[1:12:28] then his mom and there's the baby
[1:12:30] yeah mama says flap your wings again
[1:12:31] gets to the top of the coop hallelujah
[1:12:34] it's not far enough yet then finally how
[1:12:38] do I get up there flap your wings I'll
[1:12:39] catch you hallelujah
[1:12:41] salsa jumps off Riggins flapping she
[1:12:44] comes down hallelujah off they go oh
[1:12:47] yeah
[1:12:48] glory what is that now that's the
[1:12:52] dynamics the mechanics is on the ground
[1:12:55] we are the mechanics you know it's more
[1:12:57] than cheers and pulpit and music in
[1:13:00] church order it's more than bits that's
[1:13:04] mechanics but that's not really the
[1:13:05] mechanics the mechanics is the people
[1:13:07] the mechanics is of people given to him
[1:13:09] that's the mechanics right so we're the
[1:13:12] mechanics and then now the dynamics
[1:13:14] comes down gets a hold of us holy there
[1:13:17] were no longer earthbound
[1:13:18] which is anymore but we're serving in
[1:13:20] the heavenlies with him oh yeah we
[1:13:27] friends we have the devil's answer Jesus
[1:13:32] Christ is risen and he's among us not
[1:13:36] just with you but in you until the end
[1:13:38] of the world Amen Alleluia and off she
[1:13:43] goes
[1:13:44] say well I'll close with this we are
[1:13:53] being made in His image and that's why
[1:13:57] there is power in this word there's
[1:13:59] power as I said about the disciples they
[1:14:01] heard the spoken word for for three and
[1:14:03] a half years and then finally 120 seats
[1:14:07] are in the upper roof they need the Sun
[1:14:09] race to come and quicken them make them
[1:14:12] alive hallelujah in the wave sheaf will
[1:14:15] wave that life came into them now very
[1:14:17] different kind of people
[1:14:18] amen it's the same thing now with this
[1:14:21] word Jesus is being waved right he's
[1:14:27] being waved and we just have to land the
[1:14:30] Prince of the Sun right to ripen brother
[1:14:33] Brad said the ship has pulled away now
[1:14:36] the grain is exposed to the once more
[1:14:38] time the ship protected the the wheat
[1:14:40] but now the wheat I mean the shuts
[1:14:43] pulled away then now the wheat is laying
[1:14:45] in the presence of the Sun I'll show you
[1:14:48] that in Scripture let's go to let's go
[1:14:50] to the book of Mark you know what
[1:14:56] brother Brown preached was scriptural
[1:15:02] let's go to mark 4 and 26 yeah brother
[1:15:07] bear him speaks about thee is this
[1:15:09] Lutheran you know this there's the
[1:15:13] restoration I will restore Luther came
[1:15:16] out it was the blade you know you know
[1:15:19] the wheat plant growing again Luther was
[1:15:21] the was the blade then Wesley was the
[1:15:24] tassel Pentecost this is a shook than
[1:15:27] this the bride right that's the full
[1:15:30] restoration so what went down in the
