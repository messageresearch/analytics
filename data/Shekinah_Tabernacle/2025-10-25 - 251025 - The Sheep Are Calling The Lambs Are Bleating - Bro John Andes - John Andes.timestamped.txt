[25:04] [music] of all that you've done.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Parted the [singing and music] sea and
[25:11] set captives free. Never thought I'd be
[25:15] [singing and music] one.

[25:21] breathing, walking, testing, longing.

[26:10] serve is more than enough. [music]
[26:16] He can move mountains.

[31:22] ago and I hope it blesses you.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:40] &gt;&gt; The day is up. The streets are packed.
[31:44] The sun [music and singing] is blazing
[31:46] down. Their hearts are gone so cold. I
[31:49] see him limping. [singing and music]
[31:51] Dragging this weight that ain't his. The
[31:53] people look his way. But no one sees
[31:56] [music] what I [singing] see.
[31:59] Those eyes.
[32:01] All those eyes. [singing]
[32:03] That's [music] when it hits. It's all
[32:05] for me.
[32:08] He's carrying [music] my [singing]
[32:09] shame. He's carrying my blame. Crushed
[32:13] beneath [music and singing] the burden,
[32:15] but he still takes the pain. I stand
[32:18] here and cry while he bleeds for me.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, the [singing] mercy in his eyes that
[32:26] sets [music] the captives free.
[32:29] He stumbles
[32:31] and shakes.
[32:33] Still [music and singing] moving,
[32:35] still bleeding.
[32:37] And me
[32:39] [singing] I [music] follow
[32:42] silent while they throw their hay like
[32:45] stones. We reach the hill. [music]
[32:48] Gotha.
[32:50] [singing] They throw him on the wood
[32:52] like a criminal.
[32:54] But he's not. [singing]
[32:56] [music] He's not.
[32:59] He's not. He's the son of God.
[33:06] Nails to healing hands. A crown of
[33:09] [music] thorns adore.
[33:11] The sky breaks open. Crying. The veil of
[33:14] grace [music and singing] is torn.
[33:16] Thunder shakes the earth. And darkness
[33:18] falls like storm.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; But even in the silence, I know I'm not
[33:25] alone. [music and singing]
[33:26] Holy.
[33:34] Oh, whisper, [music]
[33:36] "It is [singing] finished."

[51:56] worship the Lord.
[51:58] Hallelujah. Speak to him what's on your
[52:00] heart right now. Speak to him something
[52:03] out of your life.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're thankful,
[52:09] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:15] Amen.
[52:18] Amen. I'd like to have a prayer with
[52:20] you. So, I wonder if the musicians Thank
[52:22] you very much. You've just done
[52:24] excellent today. Okay. But I' I'd like
[52:25] for us to get next to someone, all of us
[52:28] together, sister to sister, brother to
[52:30] brother, and I'd like us to lay hands on
[52:33] one another throughout the congregation.
[52:36] Those that are in the meeting, and just
[52:39] give you some time to find someone. The
[52:42] Bible says they shall lay hands on the
[52:44] sick and they shall recover. Agree on
[52:47] anything. We don't need to wait till a
[52:49] special service or ministers to come or
[52:52] someone
[52:54] special speaker. We just need to believe
[52:56] God's word. And I believe cancers can
[52:59] leave. I believe spirits can leave right
[53:02] at the start of the meeting. We don't
[53:04] need to wait for another time. So just
[53:06] lift up your voice and pray for that
[53:08] person in the name of Jesus. Lord, we're
[53:11] praying as a congregation as the sheep
[53:14] of your pasture, looking out over your
[53:17] fold today across this great globe of
[53:20] earth. Here we are in New Zealand with
[53:23] brothers and sisters, the sheep of your
[53:26] pasture, the lambs of your fold. We
[53:30] believe the message that you brought for
[53:31] this hour, Lord. And the Bible says they
[53:34] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[53:36] shall recover. The shadow of our hearts
[53:40] over our brother, over our sister could
[53:42] bring healing to them. Spiritual needs,
[53:46] emotional needs, financial needs, body
[53:50] needs in the name of Jesus. May the
[53:53] power of God flow through this
[53:55] congregation today. This is our Saturday
[53:58] morning service. Lord, we will never
[54:00] have this day again. These are sacred
[54:02] sands. These are sacred moments. And
[54:05] we're praying for our brothers, for our
[54:07] sisters, from the youngest to the
[54:09] oldest. Our voice is coming up through
[54:11] the blood. We're asking for salvation.
[54:14] We're asking for deliverance. We're
[54:17] asking for healing,
[54:19] for comfort.
[54:21] We're asking for your presence to settle
[54:23] down upon through these vessels of ours.
[54:27] Only one life will soon be passed. We
[54:30] want to give it to you. We want to
[54:32] surrender with you.
[54:35] Together, Lord, we humble ourselves to
[54:37] one another
[54:40] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. May Satan be
[54:43] defeated in every life, in every
[54:45] situation.
[54:48] May demon spirits leave this place,
[54:52] those that are live, those that are
[54:53] streaming. May the Holy Spirit move
[54:56] through the body of Christ locally and
[54:59] globally. May the surge of the Holy
[55:01] Spirit bring about a complete
[55:04] deliverance.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; May we be filled with the Holy Spirit
[55:08] even yet while we hear the word today.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; May you be strong. May you be sweet.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; May you be gentle. May you be firm.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[55:21] We surrender our bodies to you today,
[55:24] our temples. May you sweep through this
[55:27] camp, Lord, and heal us of our
[55:29] infirmities. Strengthen us this weekend,
[55:31] Lord.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Touch our spirits, Lord.
[55:36] Touch hearts that are broken, hearts
[55:37] that need to be mended, situations that
[55:40] are out of control and chaos.
[55:43] You're the healer of the broken pieces.
[55:45] You're the mener of our hearts, Lord.
[55:48] So, we pray for one another. We believe
[55:50] you're going to speak to us throughout
[55:52] these meetings. We sanctify the camp. We
[55:55] sanctify our Saturday. We we bless our
[55:58] brother Jonathan Martin in the name of
[56:01] Jesus. May we here tonight from thus
[56:03] sayeth the Lord. If you would give us
[56:05] another service, be in our fellowships,
[56:08] be in our conversation, be with us at
[56:10] the dining hall, be with us in our
[56:12] rooms, be with us and the walking down
[56:14] the pathway, in our in our singing, in
[56:18] our prayers now in the opening of your
[56:20] word. Give us strength, Lord. May the
[56:23] dynamics of your Holy Spirit just move
[56:26] through the mechanics that's all been
[56:27] laid out. Lord, we thank you for Brother
[56:30] Ben glowing in this church and for
[56:33] giving the invitation for us all to
[56:35] come. Lord, we love you, Jesus. We love
[56:39] you with all of our hearts. We want to
[56:41] love you more.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Forgive us of our sins. Forgive us where
[56:45] we fail you.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Forgive us where we've fallen short.
[56:51] Bless us today, Lord, in your presence.
[56:53] Lord,
[56:55] &gt;&gt; we thank you in Jesus name. We receive
[56:57] all of these blessings.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Thank you, Lord."
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Let's all say, "Thank you, Lord."
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[57:08] you, Lord.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Amen. Thank you,
[57:14] everyone. Amen. and shake hands with
[57:16] someone and bless them as you go.
[58:11] God bless. You can just have your seats
[58:12] for a moment. We want to welcome you to
[58:15] Shakina Tabernacle Camp.
[58:19] Each one of you that are so.
[58:28] Amen.
[58:31] Each one of you that are so special to
[58:32] the Lord Jesus
[58:37] and he loves you very much. We want to
[58:38] welcome you and
[58:41] thank you for your kind um respect and
[58:44] love for
[58:46] for one another. I sense a great unity
[58:48] in New Zealand being here and and your
[58:51] fellowship. I want to commend you for
[58:53] that.
[58:55] I want to bring greetings from our local
[58:58] church and and um to the saints that are
[59:03] in New Zealand. Greetings from End Time
[59:05] Message Tabernacle. This is our little
[59:07] group where we fellowship. We started in
[59:11] uh four years ago exactly right at this
[59:14] time in a little building on up the
[59:17] picture on the top there is a community
[59:19] center. Then the Lord gave us a little
[59:21] place. We just leased that building. We
[59:24] don't own that. Want to bring greetings
[59:27] from our local church, our associate
[59:29] pastor, brother Steve Clar, and to all
[59:31] the saints. This picture was taken um
[59:35] last year. This is our family.
[59:38] Um, sometimes ministers come and you
[59:41] don't know if they're married or
[59:43] together or have children or what
[59:45] they're saying. So,
[59:47] I think we can get to know one another a
[59:49] little bit. And, uh, the person that was
[59:52] taking this photo
[59:54] um,
[59:56] got married to my uh, son this year and
[1:00:01] on February the 28th, she's from
[1:00:03] Alabama. her father's a pastor of this
[1:00:05] message and her mother is from Romania
[1:00:09] and um out of 13 children that was in
[1:00:13] their family
[1:00:15] uh 12 of them served the Lord in the
[1:00:17] light of this message and her her
[1:00:20] grandfather this is Brianna's
[1:00:22] grandfather her mother's father was the
[1:00:25] translator of the Romanian language the
[1:00:27] voice in the text of brother Brham I
[1:00:30] just want to say this there's a blessing
[1:00:32] that follows the message.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; This photo was taken last week. We
[1:00:37] haven't showed this publicly except for
[1:00:39] the Auckland service on Wednesday night.
[1:00:41] My wife didn't even see this before
[1:00:43] that. I surprised her.
[1:00:46] But this is our family. We have three
[1:00:48] children and six grandchildren.
[1:00:52] And I just wanted to introduce them to
[1:00:54] the camp and to you. I hope that's okay.
[1:01:00] Well, this is our Saturday morning
[1:01:02] service and and the Lord laid some
[1:01:05] things on our hearts to say
[1:01:08] and um this morning we'd like to speak
[1:01:10] on the sheep are calling. The lambs are
[1:01:14] bleeding bleeding.
[1:01:17] I think New Zealand has a lot of lambs
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; and sheep.
[1:01:23] We drove here from Auckland. our flight.
[1:01:26] We were supposed to fly from Auckland to
[1:01:27] Wellington and the storms were um kind
[1:01:31] of bad on Thursday. Was it Thursday?
[1:01:34] Really bad. And so we they our flights
[1:01:37] were cancelled and they said the next
[1:01:38] flight available for you is Saturday. I
[1:01:41] said I can't do that.
[1:01:43] So we just rented a car and drove down
[1:01:45] here and
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; saw some of the sites. We were in Lake
[1:01:49] Talpo 33 years ago for our honeymoon and
[1:01:52] we enjoyed that and and seeing a lot of
[1:01:54] your sheep and
[1:01:57] sheep and sheep
[1:02:01] and things and so but before this the
[1:02:03] Lord had laid this on our heart about
[1:02:05] the sheep are calling and the lambs are
[1:02:08] bleeding.
[1:02:11] Brother Brandham in um Michigan one time
[1:02:14] was talking about
[1:02:17] the times that we're living in and the
[1:02:19] shadows of a great destruction time. He
[1:02:22] said, "I seen a scene one day of a lamb
[1:02:25] out bleeding in a field." Just going to
[1:02:28] look at this before we stand and read
[1:02:30] our scripture. A lamb bleeding out in a
[1:02:34] field. And the little fella got nervous
[1:02:36] all at once and no one could see
[1:02:37] nothing.
[1:02:39] This little lamb just felt uneasy and
[1:02:41] just kept looking around. It didn't know
[1:02:44] what to do. He'd reach down and get his
[1:02:47] mouth full of grass and he'd look
[1:02:49] around. He didn't know what to do. He
[1:02:52] walking through the glass. Brother
[1:02:54] Brandon was looking through some
[1:02:55] binoculars. Right not far from him came
[1:02:58] a big black main lion slipping up. He
[1:03:03] couldn't see it. There was no way for
[1:03:05] him to see it. But instinct told him
[1:03:08] that little lamb that danger was at hand
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; and he was nervous. He was restless.
[1:03:17] And brother Brandham said if he hadn't
[1:03:18] shot the lion,
[1:03:20] he'd have got the lamb.
[1:03:23] But there was the lion slipping up on
[1:03:25] this little poor little fellow out of
[1:03:28] there in the field. And he couldn't see
[1:03:30] it. He couldn't hear it. But there was
[1:03:33] instinct in him that told him that there
[1:03:37] was danger near.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; How many's ever felt like that before?
[1:03:41] And
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and we're living in a time of trouble.
[1:03:44] And
[1:03:46] I just wanted to say this before we read
[1:03:47] our scripture also
[1:03:51] from uh the womb of New Zealand. God has
[1:03:55] allowed his word and Holy Spirit to
[1:03:58] birth sons and daughters into message
[1:04:01] maturity
[1:04:03] and rapturing character. I believe I'm
[1:04:06] looking out over a congregation of of
[1:04:08] believers and some are joining us this
[1:04:10] evening and tomorrow that have been
[1:04:13] matured under the presence of this
[1:04:17] Jesus Christ.
[1:04:19] the message that was waved over uh this
[1:04:22] generation 65 years ago with a promise
[1:04:26] that there'll be more out in the field
[1:04:28] that will come to the same level of
[1:04:31] maturity.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Here you are.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And I just want to compliment you on
[1:04:38] that. We're not living back 65 years
[1:04:41] ago, 60 years ago. We're living today.
[1:04:44] Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And and I just want to say on behalf of
[1:04:47] brother Jonathan uh Martin and myself,
[1:04:53] he flew actually further than I did. He
[1:04:55] flew from Ohio to Houston to Auckland,
[1:04:59] then Wellington. I mean, one of his
[1:05:01] flights was 14 hours. One of my flights
[1:05:05] was almost 14 hours.
[1:05:11] We only have three services each. And if
[1:05:15] we go over an hour, maybe hour and a
[1:05:17] half, I just want to remind you,
[1:05:21] it's just a little bit of God's love to
[1:05:23] you.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; So, just have a little patience with the
[1:05:33] minister. He's trying to get out of the
[1:05:34] way. We're We're just trying to say the
[1:05:36] words that the Lord would have for you.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; We're servants. We're not anybody bigger
[1:05:43] than anybody else here.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; So, please forgive brother Jonathan and
[1:05:46] I the time zones, the change, and we're
[1:05:50] landing and we we'll be leaving right
[1:05:51] away.
[1:05:54] We'll be leaving Tuesday and headed
[1:05:55] right home for 24 hours and then to the
[1:05:59] UK for more services. So, I just wanted
[1:06:02] to say that
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; just be mindful of of our short time
[1:06:07] that we have.
[1:06:10] We're just trying to be sensitive for
[1:06:11] you.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; We only have a little time together.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Let's make the most of it.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and read together in Matthew
[1:06:28] 18.
[1:06:31] Forgive me for weeping.
[1:06:42] The sheep are calling.
[1:06:46] The lambs are bleeding.
[1:06:52] And Matthew 18, you you couldn't go
[1:06:54] through the scriptures on the screens
[1:06:56] fine. When Jesus was,
[1:06:59] it's amazing. After these years that
[1:07:01] they had been with him,
[1:07:03] this is what was on their mind.
[1:07:06] Who's the greatest?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Matthew 18 verse1 is kind of sad
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; after all those years they were so
[1:07:16] carnal.
[1:07:19] Who's the greatest?
[1:07:21] And Jesus in verse two, can you
[1:07:24] transition between scriptures and and
[1:07:27] the slides? Is that Thank you.
[1:07:31] Jesus answered the question in verse two
[1:07:33] and called a little child unto him unto
[1:07:36] them and set him in the midst of them
[1:07:40] and said, "Verily I say unto you, except
[1:07:42] ye be converted
[1:07:44] and become as little children,
[1:07:47] ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
[1:07:49] heaven." Now, how many want to live in
[1:07:52] heaven?
[1:07:55] Jesus is really preaching a whole
[1:07:57] message by bringing a little child in
[1:07:59] front of them and saying, "Unless you
[1:08:02] become like this,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; you're not going to make it."
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; When everyone is wanting to say how
[1:08:08] great we are and
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and we all we want to put out up front
[1:08:12] that we've got it all together.
[1:08:16] even come into camps like this. We can
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; we can put it out there that
[1:08:23] we can just put it out there that I'm
[1:08:24] strong
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; and I've got this
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; when really most of us are weak.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And if you just humble yourself a little
[1:08:36] bit, you don't have it all together.
[1:08:38] There's there's time sometimes in our
[1:08:40] minds we feel like we're just going
[1:08:42] crazy
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; and losing our minds.
[1:08:46] You're not weird.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; You're just a sheep.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; You're just a lamb.
[1:08:58] And so
[1:09:00] verse five
[1:09:02] or verse four, whosoever therefore shall
[1:09:05] humble, let's say humble,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; humble,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; himself
[1:09:10] as this little child,
[1:09:12] the same is the greatest in the kingdom
[1:09:15] of heaven.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And who so shall receive?
[1:09:20] And when we come to a family camp like
[1:09:22] this, I think it's a good attitude to
[1:09:24] take that it's not all about you. It's
[1:09:28] not all about me.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; But we are receiving such a little child
[1:09:34] in my name receiveth me.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; So this camp isn't all about you.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; It's not what just you can get out of
[1:09:44] it. Even though that's we need more, but
[1:09:47] it's also creating an atmosphere so that
[1:09:50] other people around me can receive it.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And and Lord, if I don't receive
[1:09:54] anything,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; if you don't talk to me,
[1:09:59] would you please speak to someone,
[1:10:01] another sheep, another lamb? But but
[1:10:04] Lord, I cry out to you.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Don't pass me by.
[1:10:16] And then he said,
[1:10:19] "Who shall receive one so such little
[1:10:22] child in my name receiveth me?" Verse
[1:10:24] six, "But whosoever who so shall offend
[1:10:28] one of these little ones which believe
[1:10:31] in me."
[1:10:32] Are you listening?
[1:10:34] It would be better for him that a
[1:10:36] millstone were hanged about his neck,
[1:10:39] and that he was drowned in the depth of
[1:10:41] the sea.
[1:10:44] Woe unto the world because of offenses.
[1:10:47] For it must needs be that offenses come.
[1:10:51] Have you ever felt offended or violated
[1:10:54] because of their music,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; because of their dress?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; It's an offense to you.
[1:11:04] You just feel like being simple and
[1:11:07] little and humble and the world is
[1:11:10] offensive to you.
[1:11:14] Let's just skip down to verse 10, our
[1:11:16] last verse, before we're seated. Take
[1:11:18] heed that ye despise not one of these
[1:11:22] little ones.
[1:11:24] I'm I'm conditioning you for the service
[1:11:26] today.
[1:11:28] Despise not one of these little ones.
[1:11:30] For I say unto you that in heaven their
[1:11:34] angels do always behold the face of my
[1:11:38] father which is in heaven.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Is that incredible?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Don't despise one of these little ones.
[1:11:46] God bless you. You can have your seats.
[1:11:51] Well,
[1:11:53] I know the schedule and they've told me
[1:11:55] when our lunchtime is.
[1:11:58] I might need a little help up here
[1:11:59] because we kind of went away on on my
[1:12:01] iPad. Just maybe log me back in if you
[1:12:05] will.
[1:12:08] Well, they've told me the schedule for
[1:12:09] lunch and so I'll make sure you get to
[1:12:12] lunch. Who enjoys lunch?
[1:12:16] Half of you. Okay. Who enjoys lunch? I
[1:12:18] mean,
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; who loves fellowship?
[1:12:26] My wife was born and raised in the
[1:12:29] message in Australia and she came to New
[1:12:31] Zealand when she was 18 years old.
[1:12:35] [snorts]
[1:12:36] And that's why I said earlier, thank
[1:12:39] you, brother James, that out of the womb
[1:12:42] of New Zealand, God has brought forth
[1:12:45] seed is because she was there in
[1:12:48] Auckland in the services and God used a
[1:12:52] min ministry to win her heart to him.
[1:12:56] And she sits here today,
[1:12:59] a daughter of Christ and one that came
[1:13:02] through the womb of New Zealand.
[1:13:06] The word of God is great. Isn't he
[1:13:07] great?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Who thinks that he's great? The Lord is
[1:13:10] great. [applause]
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; So, I just remind you to to just get out
[1:13:16] of the way so that Jesus Christ can
[1:13:18] bring forth and birth what he's wanting
[1:13:21] to do in your life. I look into your
[1:13:22] faces today. I love you.
[1:13:28] Brother John's just a real little
[1:13:29] minister. I I don't claim to be anybody.
[1:13:33] We've known some of you since the 80s,
[1:13:35] the 90s,
[1:13:38] some more recently through co and
[1:13:42] through Youth Without Borders. And
[1:13:46] sometimes we'd be all alone in a room at
[1:13:48] 1:00 in the morning, 2 in the morning,
[1:13:50] and
[1:13:51] there literally be hundreds of God's
[1:13:54] sheep and lambs from around the world,
[1:13:57] over 50 uh countries sometimes.
[1:14:02] Sometimes we'd have over a thousand
[1:14:04] people live by Zoom and Facebook and
[1:14:09] YouTube that were streaming those
[1:14:10] meetings. God was taking care of some of
[1:14:13] his lambs.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Some of his sheep was helped in those
[1:14:17] times and and God used you
[1:14:22] globally.
[1:14:24] And he'll never forget that.
[1:14:31] I just always want to encourage you to
[1:14:33] stay tender before the Lord.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Don't ever try to be great or something
[1:14:40] big.
[1:14:42] Just see how little you can get.
[1:14:45] Stay simple.
[1:14:51] Can you just play a little bit of that?
[1:14:52] I wanted to play something to you today
[1:14:55] of the sheep calling and lambs bleeding
[1:14:59] so that we'd all be able to understand
[1:15:01] the sounds and where we're coming from
[1:15:04] today.
[1:15:06] The sheep are calling and the lambs
[1:15:10] just a little bit louder. Can you turn
[1:15:12] it up a little bit? I wanted to bring
[1:15:13] the sound [laughter]
[1:15:27] Ain't that incredible?
[1:15:30] Just turn it up a little bit. Amen.
[1:15:33] Hallelujah.
[1:15:37] Sheep calling.
[1:15:53] Jesus said, "Lest we become like little
[1:15:55] children, we're not going to make it
[1:15:56] in."
[1:15:59] And they all were said, "Talk to us
[1:16:01] about marriage and divorce. talk to us
[1:16:03] about the thunders and the mysteries.
[1:16:05] And Jesus brought up a little child in
[1:16:07] front of them and said, "Unless you
[1:16:10] become like one of these, you're not
[1:16:12] going to make it." I want to make it.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you, sheep. Why are
[1:16:21] they calling?
[1:16:23] And and some days ago when the Lord laid
[1:16:26] this on my heart to say speak today, I
[1:16:29] actually wrote in my notes, the sheep
[1:16:31] are out and they are crying.
[1:16:36] The cry of a lamb, the cry of a sheep,
[1:16:38] the sheep are out. They get out of the
[1:16:41] fold. They they run around.
[1:16:44] I was listening this morning in my room
[1:16:47] to a message, the good shepherd of the
[1:16:49] sheep. That would be a good message for
[1:16:51] you to hear. 1957
[1:16:53] and brother Brandham said it's a
[1:16:55] reproach on the shepherd to lose one
[1:16:58] sheep.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's a reproach on the shepherd to lose
[1:17:04] one sheep.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; How many believe Psalms 23, the Lord is
[1:17:09] my shepherd?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Just raise your hand. How many believe
[1:17:12] the Bible? The Lord is our shepherd.
[1:17:14] Amen.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; It's a reproach on our shepherd to lose
[1:17:20] one sheep.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose one.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And so I think about this. I I I was
[1:17:30] thinking about and I if I have time
[1:17:32] before your lunch, if not I'll just cut
[1:17:35] it off, but about the broken hearts
[1:17:40] and about those that have been wounded
[1:17:44] within their lives.
[1:17:48] I wonder today, this morning, how many
[1:17:50] came from a broken home, a broken
[1:17:52] marriage,
[1:17:54] and your your family was broken? Just
[1:17:57] some of you that are even in the back,
[1:17:59] some of you adults, father, mother, the
[1:18:01] marriage was broken. Your father, mother
[1:18:03] broke. Just let lift your hand up. It's
[1:18:05] not embarrassing. It's just from a
[1:18:07] broken home, a broken family.
[1:18:15] You know, there's very few of us that
[1:18:18] are in this room today, message
[1:18:20] believers. A lot of us, some have been
[1:18:23] born and raised in the message,
[1:18:26] but a lot of our parents are older ones
[1:18:29] came out and they're the only ones
[1:18:30] serving the Lord out of their whole
[1:18:33] family. Is that true? I know we have
[1:18:36] young people and children. I was born
[1:18:38] and raised in the message, but I'm so
[1:18:41] thankful. But there's others that came
[1:18:42] from a lot of of tearing up and um
[1:18:46] people that rejected them and scoff them
[1:18:50] and cut them off.
[1:18:55] And even in this room today that we come
[1:18:57] from different nationalities,
[1:18:59] New Zealand, and some come from Africa,
[1:19:02] Samoa, some come from Philippines, and I
[1:19:05] don't know what other countries are
[1:19:06] represented here. Can you say them out?
[1:19:09] Just say it out.
[1:19:12] Say it loud again.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:19:22] And we've come from different
[1:19:23] nationalities and places and sometimes
[1:19:25] we can even have complexes right here
[1:19:28] even in the message in the fold because
[1:19:31] we're God's sheep and she and sheep of
[1:19:34] his pastures. We can carry baggage from
[1:19:36] things that we go through on our jobs.
[1:19:39] I'm just talking to you a little bit.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; We We can carry anxieties. I know
[1:19:44] there's people that don't even go to
[1:19:46] church because they're afraid of crowds.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; They're nervous. It's not that they
[1:19:51] don't like people or the message or the
[1:19:55] Lord. It's just they get nervous. They
[1:19:56] get anxious. I pray the Lord would help
[1:19:59] us during this camp to to be more
[1:20:01] mindful and to be um to just be mindful
[1:20:05] of one another
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; and we carry burdens.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Sister Christine is here today
[1:20:16] and last June when she got into her
[1:20:19] vehicle and drove down that highway.
[1:20:22] If there's any person in this building
[1:20:25] would have known that was going to
[1:20:27] happen, you would have stopped her.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; You would have said, "Don't go out the
[1:20:31] door.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Don't get in the vehicle.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; I want to stop you from the pain.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I want to stop you from the dizziness.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; I want to spare the pastor. Spare the
[1:20:43] children.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Spare the church.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Spare us globally cuz we bear the
[1:20:48] burden, too. Just stop, Christine. take
[1:20:51] a spa day.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; But there's things we go through.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; There's things we face that the Lord
[1:21:01] allows
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; cuz he's molding character.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; He's molding something of beauty in your
[1:21:07] life.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; You are a sheep. You're one of his
[1:21:10] lambs. Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And when this came upon my heart
[1:21:16] about the sheep are calling
[1:21:19] and the lambs are bleeding.
[1:21:23] It was just made in a place like this
[1:21:26] down on my knees with my Bible open and
[1:21:28] looking into a bouquet of flowers and
[1:21:30] and and things like this. You might
[1:21:32] think Brother John's crazy,
[1:21:35] but this is how the Holy Spirit moves.
[1:21:37] He He deals. He knows. He knows what we
[1:21:41] have need of.
[1:21:43] It might be a word at the end of the
[1:21:44] service or tonight.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; It might be tomorrow.
[1:21:49] It might be something that happens
[1:21:51] during this weekend in fellowship or a
[1:21:54] sister or a brother or a young person,
[1:21:57] something clicks.
[1:22:00] you know, being raised in the message
[1:22:03] too and hearing these things from a
[1:22:05] youth in the Brandham tabernacle and
[1:22:07] right in the very place where brother
[1:22:09] Brandham was. And
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; but yet there came a day when the lights
[1:22:15] came on.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; There just came a day when the key
[1:22:18] turned in the lock.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And until that happens, we can't force
[1:22:23] it on one another.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; We can't make it happen. That's right.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; We can't force someone and drag them
[1:22:30] into the presence of God and give them a
[1:22:32] humble heart or a broken spirit so they
[1:22:35] they just surrender. It takes the Lord
[1:22:37] to do that.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; But the Lord is very good at doing that.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; How many say amen?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord is very good at being a good
[1:22:47] shepherd.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; It's a reproach on him
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; to lose you.
[1:22:59] and he's not going to lose you.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, it might sound simple, but
[1:23:04] Brother Brandham said um just after the
[1:23:06] seals, the the Sunday two several weeks
[1:23:10] later after the seals, he spoke God in
[1:23:13] simplicity Sunday morning and then the
[1:23:15] seals and then the the Sunday that he
[1:23:17] preached here in April, God hiding in
[1:23:19] simplicity. He was like he was holding
[1:23:22] everything
[1:23:24] in between these this thought is keep
[1:23:27] your life simple.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And I know it's mysterious and the
[1:23:32] opening of the seven seals and the deep
[1:23:35] mysteries but at the end of it all keep
[1:23:38] it simple.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; God hidden and revealed in simplicity.
[1:23:42] Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; So, I'd say this that a man can sit down
[1:23:47] and look at a bunch of flowers or
[1:23:49] bouquet and study that 30 minutes
[1:23:51] sincerely with all his heart and know
[1:23:53] more about God than he did if he had all
[1:23:56] the degrees that a Bible school could
[1:23:58] give him.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Starts talking about God revealing
[1:24:03] himself in the flowers and things and
[1:24:05] the colors.
[1:24:07] Just down from there, he said one hour
[1:24:10] would really prove it. would teach you
[1:24:12] more about God than all the degrees you
[1:24:16] could have.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Just think about that today. Maybe I
[1:24:20] just need to go back to this and let's
[1:24:22] all look at this for an hour.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; I'm serious.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; We get the message and our gatherings
[1:24:31] down to the preacher,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; down to everybody looking forward and
[1:24:36] and we almost get into a frame of mind
[1:24:39] that that's God or that's this. But
[1:24:41] really, God's hidden and revealed behind
[1:24:43] all of that. Behind the band and the
[1:24:46] music and the preacher and behind all of
[1:24:48] our dress and our Bibles and and is is
[1:24:52] must be alive.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; So when I was thinking coming here about
[1:25:00] the sheeps are calling and the lambs are
[1:25:03] bleeding,
[1:25:05] just think about the this why are they
[1:25:08] calling? Why are the sheep calling and
[1:25:11] lambs? Why are they bleeding?
[1:25:14] Is there an area that needs to be
[1:25:16] uncovered or dealt with?
[1:25:19] Cuz you can be born in the church. You
[1:25:21] can be raised in the church. You could
[1:25:23] hear about brother Brandham from a
[1:25:25] little girl and a little boy. You you
[1:25:27] can know that you should be doing
[1:25:29] better.
[1:25:32] But sometimes it takes a certain doctor
[1:25:35] that that knows the case. a specialist
[1:25:38] to be go into a certain area and just
[1:25:41] say things in a certain way and it
[1:25:43] starts uncovering and starts moving
[1:25:46] things around in a believer's heart that
[1:25:49] you can go through that for just a
[1:25:51] moment in his presence can transform you
[1:25:54] forever.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Just being in the presence of the Lord
[1:25:59] for 30 minutes. And I know that's
[1:26:01] difficult cuz this generation, let's be
[1:26:04] honest already. Some of you, your minds
[1:26:07] are wandering. You're shifting. 20
[1:26:10] minutes is our focus cuz we're swipe,
[1:26:12] hit, punch. We're was raised in that.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And you can preach against cell phones
[1:26:17] and media all you want to, but they're
[1:26:20] here to stay.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And we can talk about websites and
[1:26:26] people and all of that, but it's the
[1:26:28] tree of knowledge. But there's also a
[1:26:30] tree of life.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; You can say that's a bad plant. That's a
[1:26:35] poisonous mushroom. You can be t talking
[1:26:38] about all the bad things that we
[1:26:39] shouldn't be doing. But a real shepherd
[1:26:42] just leads the sheep to the good food.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; He leads them to the grass.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; He leads them to cool waters.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Sheep need shade.
[1:26:57] That's why I thank you, brother Ben and
[1:26:59] church for allowing us all to have this
[1:27:01] family camp together because believers
[1:27:04] need times like this.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; We need times that we can just pause and
[1:27:10] just reflect.
[1:27:14] There's times in meetings that we need
[1:27:17] it to be restful and calm
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; because that's how the Holy Spirit moves
[1:27:24] and he settles down into hearts when
[1:27:26] it's calm.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Still waters run deep.
[1:27:32] As much as you might want to have fast
[1:27:35] and rushing falls and streams, a really
[1:27:38] good shepherd knows that sheep and lambs
[1:27:41] have got to go by cool waters.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; They get nervous.
[1:27:46] And if we're not careful, I'm talking
[1:27:47] about ministers can be the wrong example
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; from behind the pulpit
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; and think that everything's got to be
[1:27:54] loud and rushing and and and we've all
[1:27:57] got to be jumping and screaming. It
[1:27:59] might be just the opposite of what the
[1:28:01] Lord wants from us.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Be still and know that I am God is still
[1:28:10] part of the Bible.
[1:28:12] And it just might be in a meeting like
[1:28:14] this that the Holy Spirit can drop a
[1:28:17] seed down in a certain way and then it
[1:28:19] can go a little bit deeper
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; and you can settle down and with that
[1:28:24] calm assurance, it just comes around a
[1:28:27] young man and a young lady that if you
[1:28:30] look, they're just going like this.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; The nervousness of the age, the the
[1:28:37] spiritual raping of our youth is
[1:28:40] rampant.
[1:28:42] I'm speaking to you as one that's from
[1:28:44] America. Brother Jonathan's from
[1:28:46] America. But I pray God we would not
[1:28:48] bring an American spirit to you.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; A pride and arrogancy.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; That's what the American spirit is, is
[1:28:57] pride. In the first seal when brother
[1:29:00] Brandham read Malachi 4 verse one, when
[1:29:03] it talks about the proud and and brother
[1:29:05] Brandham stopped and he said like the
[1:29:07] Americans and so forth. And if we're not
[1:29:09] careful, we can start feeding from that.
[1:29:12] And I know through co a lot of you was
[1:29:14] at home more and you streamed other
[1:29:16] services and streamed meetings. Maybe
[1:29:18] they came from other countries or even
[1:29:20] from America. Let me say this. You don't
[1:29:23] live in America.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; You live in New Zealand.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And you need to find the channel and the
[1:29:30] mind of the Lord for for your area and
[1:29:32] for your church and for your family.
[1:29:40] Do I have the liberty just to speak
[1:29:41] what's on my heart and
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; just say what the Lord would have us to
[1:29:46] say? The lambs are bleeding. The lambs
[1:29:50] in John chapter 21, Jesus talked about
[1:29:54] this to Peter and said, "Feed my lambs."
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Can you put that up for the people? I
[1:30:01] don't know. Is it bad to go back and
[1:30:02] forth?
[1:30:05] John 21:E1 15.
[1:30:08] You that are writing notes can just see
[1:30:10] that Jesus was talking to Peter and he
[1:30:13] said, "Feed my lambs."
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; That's number one. If you really love
[1:30:20] him, you will have a heart for the
[1:30:23] young.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; So, a a real ministry. Um, let me talk
[1:30:28] about lambs for just a moment. A lamb is
[1:30:30] a baby sheep. They're young sheep.
[1:30:33] They're the youth.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; They are children in the message. They
[1:30:39] are the young in faith. They're someone
[1:30:40] that you could be middle-aged or older,
[1:30:43] but you're young in the faith. You're a
[1:30:44] new Christian. That's a l the lambs are
[1:30:47] are bleeding.
[1:30:50] Is the young and courage, too. I'm young
[1:30:54] and courage. I I'm a youth in my
[1:30:56] courage. I I feel, brother John, like
[1:30:59] I'm just depressed and oppressed.
[1:31:02] And then you just start bleeding. You
[1:31:05] just And you don't even know what you're
[1:31:07] doing or saying, but you The Lord hears
[1:31:09] that cry.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; The Lord has heard your cry.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; The youth of the message. The lambs are
[1:31:22] bleeding. The lambs are crying. Is the
[1:31:25] youth of the message.
[1:31:28] the young people, the children, the
[1:31:30] teenagers, new Christians.
[1:31:33] It's the heart that is coming to the
[1:31:36] surface. Is this okay today?
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Your heart is coming to the surface and
[1:31:42] the Lord is dealing with that.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I just want to say this. I don't know if
[1:31:47] I can say it strong enough for you and
[1:31:49] for us, but God has heard your cry.
[1:31:54] Even for this message today, God has
[1:31:56] heard your cry.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; He's heard the call from your heart and
[1:32:02] your thirst.
[1:32:05] your thirst that he put inside of that
[1:32:08] seed to be like him
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; in the midst of all the concrete that
[1:32:13] Satan's trying to pour on your life and
[1:32:15] all the education and all the school and
[1:32:18] all the grades and got to go got to go
[1:32:21] got to make money got to perform got to
[1:32:23] be a good you know girlfriend got to be
[1:32:26] a good boyfriend got to be a good spouse
[1:32:28] got to be a good pastor got to be a good
[1:32:31] deacon friend sometimes we just need to
[1:32:33] humble ourselves elves look at one
[1:32:35] another as sons and daughters of God and
[1:32:38] let's just be real for a little bit.
[1:32:40] Let's let the Holy Ghost come down into
[1:32:42] a place
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; that now he can move in our hearts in a
[1:32:47] way so that when we leave here on Monday
[1:32:49] and Tuesday something has been dropped
[1:32:52] down on a deeper level.
[1:32:57] How many would like that
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; that I can go away with something
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; and and long after brother John Jonathan
[1:33:05] is in back home and brother John's
[1:33:07] already flying the other way that you
[1:33:10] can say I didn't feed from a man
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; and that sister that talked to me out
[1:33:14] there by that fence and and and shared
[1:33:17] with me somebody laid their hand on my
[1:33:18] shoulder somebody spoke to me for five
[1:33:21] minutes
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; really connected with me you can say
[1:33:24] thank the Lord.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; He's a rock in a weary land.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just need a fresh drink of
[1:33:32] water
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; and we don't need a three-hour sermon.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; We just need a moment.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; I just need a moment to breathe.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; If you notice our title, he didn't call
[1:33:47] you a goat.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't say nothing about you being a
[1:33:51] Judas.
[1:33:54] You being foolish virgin,
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; you missing the rapture,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; you're a sheep.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And if you're a young sheep that is a
[1:34:05] lamb,
[1:34:08] praise God for that.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Some people don't like noise in the
[1:34:13] church. They don't like little children
[1:34:15] making noise. They don't like people
[1:34:17] little children running. As you get
[1:34:19] older, you get a little bit more
[1:34:21] contankerous and you don't like your the
[1:34:24] excuse me for saying that. I'm of
[1:34:25] grandpa, too. And little hands on the
[1:34:28] windows and marks on the
[1:34:31] floor and everything's all topsyturvy
[1:34:34] and you just clean that up and then
[1:34:36] something spilled. That just means that
[1:34:38] there's children around the house.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; When young people are running through
[1:34:43] the church and they're screaming and
[1:34:44] they're making noises, there's a lot of
[1:34:46] people that don't like that. I'm going
[1:34:47] to tell you what you're going to have in
[1:34:48] a few years. An old dried up church.
[1:34:52] Bunch of old people.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Your young people will leave.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Young families will leave.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Say they left the message. Sometimes
[1:35:03] they did. But sometimes they left what
[1:35:05] you were calling the message.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; What you and I What have we done with
[1:35:10] Christ?
[1:35:13] And so I just as we're going to come
[1:35:14] through the word here in a little bit,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; the voice, the heart of the shepherd
[1:35:20] will go for the one
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; and not the 90 and nine only that have
[1:35:24] it all together.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; See, we're carnal. We focus on the 99
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; and the amens that we want to get and
[1:35:33] leaving like we had a real meeting,
[1:35:35] brother.
[1:35:37] How many remember the message influence
[1:35:40] when brother Brandham preached that many
[1:35:42] times but in the one service when he
[1:35:44] spoke and and had an altar call and a
[1:35:47] mana young man came forward and he said
[1:35:50] I would pray that he would be another
[1:35:51] Isaiah. Is there another anyone else
[1:35:53] here that would like to come forward and
[1:35:55] give your heart to the Lord? They're
[1:35:56] just very very few.
[1:35:59] Then brother Brandham drops back into
[1:36:01] discernment and starts calling out
[1:36:02] people's names and their addresses and
[1:36:05] their disease and you back there and you
[1:36:07] got this and you've got that certain
[1:36:08] kind. You can hear the people
[1:36:11] [screaming] and crying out. And then he
[1:36:13] said now who would come
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; and they it was packed out.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; The aisles were full. He said the aisles
[1:36:21] are full. The altars are full. He said
[1:36:23] there's two or 300 of you that should be
[1:36:25] up here. That's what he said. So the
[1:36:28] altars were full was just packed out.
[1:36:30] There's a lot of us that said would have
[1:36:32] said, "Man, we had a meeting."
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, right in that
[1:36:36] time, he rebuked them and said, "You
[1:36:38] have done the worst thing you could have
[1:36:40] ever done.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; You should have responded to the word."
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Now that was our prophet.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; When the altars were full and they were
[1:36:49] going right on down the aisles and my we
[1:36:51] would have probably left and sat in the
[1:36:53] back room, took off our coat. We man, we
[1:36:55] had a meeting. What a response to the
[1:36:57] word. And brother Brandham, rebuke them.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; So our response should be to the word.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Our response should be the Lord dealing
[1:37:06] with hearts that it's like Lord, you are
[1:37:09] saying exactly what I've already been.
[1:37:11] Something's been going through my life
[1:37:13] and the word met me at that sacred
[1:37:15] place.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And at that moment, I surrendered.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; At that moment, I just gave it all up.
[1:37:23] It happened in the book of Acts while
[1:37:25] they heard the word, they were filled
[1:37:27] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I believe we're living in another book
[1:37:30] of Acts when
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; when men and women can be actually
[1:37:33] filled with the Holy Spirit right in a
[1:37:35] meeting
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; and God can already know
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; weeks ago what this service needed to
[1:37:42] have right this morning. And he would
[1:37:44] lay it on a minister's heart. what we're
[1:37:46] going to hear tonight doesn't have to
[1:37:48] always be just spontaneous uh
[1:37:50] inspiration that that moment. It can be
[1:37:53] where God's been dealing, God's been
[1:37:55] deeply stirring
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; and that's been on that minister's
[1:37:58] heart. Can you can you agree with me?
[1:38:00] God can lay it on a minister's heart in
[1:38:03] another country
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; to come and say a certain word that is
[1:38:09] thus sayeth the Lord
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; just as much as brother Brandham saying
[1:38:13] and your address and your name and your
[1:38:15] condition and this is that
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; if if we can just come to that
[1:38:19] revelation that Jesus is here
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus is in this building right now
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; two or three of us have gathered we've
[1:38:28] gathered from all different places and
[1:38:30] and we came with needs and burdens and
[1:38:32] the lambs are are crying and they're
[1:38:34] calling Lord do something for us. Do
[1:38:37] something for our children. Now help me
[1:38:38] as I move into another level here. We
[1:38:41] pray for our children. We pray for the
[1:38:43] needs in our churches or and and then
[1:38:45] the we've come to such a time as this.
[1:38:48] Then this ought to be the moment that
[1:38:51] all of us together, one heart and one
[1:38:54] mind ought to just be on the edge of our
[1:38:56] seats. Lord, just say the word that
[1:38:58] needs to be spoken. I'm not here for
[1:39:00] just for for an emotion or a gymnastics
[1:39:03] class. I am here that the word would
[1:39:06] come down to my life, to my daughter, to
[1:39:09] my son.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; The song leaders need to be ministered
[1:39:12] to.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Our musicians need to be ministered to.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; We've got pastors here that have burdens
[1:39:19] and needs and and ministry that are here
[1:39:22] and we've all come together. I have
[1:39:24] burdens.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:28] We all do, friends.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; And it's a call.
[1:39:35] The blading of a sheep or the blading of
[1:39:37] a lamb
[1:39:41] is not complaining.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not complaining.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; It's not a whining, an annoying, just
[1:39:50] knowing, knowing, knowing, Lord. It's
[1:39:52] out of love. I'm just coming to you
[1:39:55] today. This is our Saturday morning
[1:39:57] service, Lord. There's needs among us.
[1:39:59] There's needs. There's situations.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; We've been in prayer. We've been Lord,
[1:40:04] you know what we go through through the
[1:40:05] week. This is October 2025,
[1:40:09] and we can all look so pious and
[1:40:10] religious. But friends, we are in
[1:40:12] desperate times.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; We've not come this way before.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; What our children are dealing with, what
[1:40:19] our grandchildren are dealing with is 10
[1:40:21] times worse. If you've got children,
[1:40:24] this what our prophet said.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; You, we've been in the message long
[1:40:27] enough. Some of you older ones ought to
[1:40:29] know. Brother John's already quoted
[1:40:31] things verbatim. What Brother Brandham
[1:40:33] said, he said, "Our children have it 10
[1:40:35] times worse than we have."
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Then if we've got grandchildren, then
[1:40:42] how much more is it?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; It's a hundred times. Cuz 10 times more
[1:40:47] than 10 times more, then there ought to
[1:40:49] be a sensitivity.
[1:40:53] There ought to be a greater awareness
[1:40:55] that we have people here.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Sheep here.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; There's burdens here.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Can we all just give it to him together?
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Just give it to the Lord together. I
[1:41:09] wonder what would happen this weekend if
[1:41:11] all of us just had an attitude
[1:41:12] adjustment and said, "Lord, I give
[1:41:14] myself to you.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; I give myself away. What are you trying
[1:41:18] to do, Lord? What are you doing in my
[1:41:20] life?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to know that this is a safe
[1:41:28] place.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; These meetings are a safe place.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; There should be no bullying going on
[1:41:33] here.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody looking at one another
[1:41:36] criticizing, oh, this person or that
[1:41:38] person. Friends, we're all in this
[1:41:40] together.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; God don't like bullies at in the middle
[1:41:44] school. He don't like them in the
[1:41:45] church.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; We're not here for politics. Brother
[1:41:48] John isn't here to tell you what I know
[1:41:50] or to preach to the pastors or some
[1:41:52] great deep revelation.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach minis mysteries.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach Christ to you.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He answers the questions. He just
[1:42:05] dissolves the doubts.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; You might have already got it last
[1:42:08] night. You might already be filled up.
[1:42:10] Then somebody that's really filled up
[1:42:12] begins to have care for somebody else.
[1:42:17] The way that a real shepherd deals with
[1:42:19] sheep is gently.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; I just heard that this morning too from
[1:42:25] brother Brandham in in that message.
[1:42:28] The good shepherd of the sheep
[1:42:31] that a shepherd deals gently with sheep.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; We love sheep. Who who likes sheep or
[1:42:42] lambs? Just raise your hand. You look to
[1:42:44] the face of a lamb. It's like, wow,
[1:42:46] incredible.
[1:42:47] We were seeing them all over the place.
[1:42:49] We had to just drive all one of the
[1:42:51] towns. We just drove off up through the
[1:42:53] town and we drove through some back road
[1:42:55] somewhere down some lane and the
[1:42:57] people's opening their window looking at
[1:42:59] the dogs are barking and we're driving
[1:43:02] up to somebody's house to their farm. We
[1:43:04] just wanted to see sheep
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and we pull in there, you know, and in
[1:43:09] America they'd probably be shooting you
[1:43:10] by now, you [laughter] know. I'm
[1:43:12] serious.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:43:14] But New Zealand doesn't have that
[1:43:16] spirit, right? You all are kind, gentle,
[1:43:18] and so good. Somebody driving down your
[1:43:23] road, and we pulled in there. Nice to
[1:43:26] have you today. Thank you for saying
[1:43:28] yes.
[1:43:33] We pulled in there and Molly come out
[1:43:35] with her little baby and
[1:43:37] and there's all these sheep everywhere
[1:43:40] and little lambs. And this one was born
[1:43:42] last Friday. My little baby hard
[1:43:46] couldn't hardly walk and they're all
[1:43:47] just being like sheep and lambs. It's
[1:43:50] like, yes.
[1:43:53] But then we come to the camp here and we
[1:43:55] look around spiritually. We're sheep of
[1:43:58] his pasture.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And there's lambs. There's little
[1:44:02] there's little girls, little boys,
[1:44:04] there's young people.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; We've got teenagers. We got older ones.
[1:44:10] my one of these places. We stopped and
[1:44:12] we pulled over. Here goes brother John.
[1:44:14] We pulled over and we My wife gets out.
[1:44:17] She's videoing and then this whole
[1:44:18] field. She came back and said those were
[1:44:21] the
[1:44:24] ugliest sheep she's ever seen. She said
[1:44:28] it.
[1:44:30] I mean, some are no hair, some are like
[1:44:33] half shoring, some are like big woolly.
[1:44:36] It's like in this one field. They're
[1:44:38] ugly.
[1:44:43] And I'm looking at you today.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Well, what are you all thinking? I was
[1:44:57] thinking I [laughter] I I was thinking
[1:44:59] of that song, He Made Something
[1:45:01] Beautiful of My Love. What were you
[1:45:03] thinking?
[1:45:05] Come on.
[1:45:07] We're supposed to be one mind and one
[1:45:08] accord. Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; But let me say this. Whether you're an
[1:45:16] ugly sheep or a sheep that still trying
[1:45:20] to get things together, you're still a
[1:45:22] sheep.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And I just praise God that God has put a
[1:45:25] seed inside of you.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; No matter how far you wander and where
[1:45:31] you go,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; you don't make a good makeeliever.
[1:45:35] You don't make a good partier.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; You don't feel all when the guys are all
[1:45:40] happy and they're talking about their
[1:45:43] their jokes and they got their alcohol
[1:45:45] and they're talking about their movies.
[1:45:46] You don't fit in.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You can watch their movies. You can be
[1:45:50] on their drugs. You can do all kinds of
[1:45:52] perverted things and you're not happy.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; You're not fulfilled.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Am I talking to somebody?
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; You can do all the things the world does
[1:46:02] and you're miserable.
[1:46:04] You're like a fish out of water. You're
[1:46:06] you're just you're you're troubled.
[1:46:08] You're nervous. You're upset. That's
[1:46:10] because you're a sheep.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I I was reminded this past week of the
[1:46:16] prodical son. The Bible says, "And when
[1:46:20] he came to himself,
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; is that what the Bible says?" We could
[1:46:23] all turn to it, but you all know that
[1:46:25] that's what the Bible says. when he came
[1:46:27] to himself.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And that's all that needs to happen
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; is that the great shepherd would just
[1:46:33] deal with that person in the way that he
[1:46:35] knows how to win their hearts. Lord, you
[1:46:38] know
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; what it's going to take
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; to win that person for you.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; The Lord knows the those that are his.
[1:46:48] That's right.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; How many have tried to make things
[1:46:52] happen and no, you're going to do this
[1:46:54] and you're going to dress this certain
[1:46:55] way, you're going to be and it's just
[1:46:57] hypocritical.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; But you let God do something. You let
[1:47:00] the Holy Spirit come down on a person
[1:47:02] and it changes them. They don't have to
[1:47:05] put on nothing. It's real.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; And that's what these camps are good
[1:47:15] for.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Birthing sheep.
[1:47:18] birthing lambs.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody wander in. Somebody come. Some
[1:47:23] not don't even know what to expect, but
[1:47:25] the the Lord knows.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody that just wants reality.
[1:47:32] They're just moaning. That's what a
[1:47:34] bleeding a bleeding of a sheep is.
[1:47:39] They're wanting direction for their for
[1:47:41] their life. It's a feeble
[1:47:45] outcry.
[1:47:47] They just want reality. It becomes a
[1:47:49] moan. Sometimes
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; they'll be looking straight ahead,
[1:47:52] driving down the road or in in a
[1:47:54] situation with their friends and it's
[1:47:57] like a lament. It's like they look out
[1:47:59] the the train window, everything's going
[1:48:02] by so fast. They're not happy.
[1:48:06] I think it was David that said, "I long
[1:48:10] and I desire to see his glory like I
[1:48:13] have seen it in the sanctuary."
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to see you, Lord. I want to
[1:48:18] see you come on the scene in a way that
[1:48:20] it changes lives.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Brother James, I need your help up here
[1:48:24] again. It goes to sleep. I think that's
[1:48:26] cuz I'm going too slow. Is that right,
[1:48:29] brother? Brother Matt, that's the reason
[1:48:31] why it's going to sleep up here, right?
[1:48:34] I think so. It is. It's not you. It's
[1:48:36] just the m It's just we're working
[1:48:38] together. Amen.
[1:48:42] Let's go to uh Matthew 18 again. Verse
[1:48:45] 11.
[1:48:49] Thank the Lord for these brothers and
[1:48:50] sisters helping
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; at the camp and all the media and all
[1:48:54] the workers, all the cleaners. Let's
[1:48:56] give the Lord a real [applause] praise
[1:48:58] for these brothers and sisters. Now,
[1:49:04] [applause]
[1:49:06] Matthew 18:1,
[1:49:09] I promised you for your lunch. You're
[1:49:11] you're going to make your lunch. Okay.
[1:49:14] For the Son of Man, Matthew 18:1, the
[1:49:18] Son of Man has come to save that which
[1:49:21] was lost.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Some for years had it all wrong. It's
[1:49:26] just come to make big churches.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; It just come to, you know, get a people
[1:49:31] all dressed in a certain way, acting in
[1:49:33] a certain way. We're all in the message.
[1:49:36] And you find out very, very fast that
[1:49:38] the message is to save that which was
[1:49:40] lost.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; People that were astray. Matthew 18:1,
[1:49:46] the Is that what your Bible says?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; The Son of Man has come to save that
[1:49:51] which was lost.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Then what should be our mission at camp
[1:49:56] when we come together like this? Your
[1:49:58] spiritual radar ought to be going all
[1:50:00] over the place. Is there a need? Is
[1:50:02] there a burden? How can we get out of
[1:50:04] the way? Say, "I don't like that music."
[1:50:07] Nobody asked you. You say, "I don't like
[1:50:09] that preacher." Nobody asked you.
[1:50:12] That's right.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't like Brother John
[1:50:14] Andy's." Nobody asked you.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; And if you get really personal, I'm
[1:50:18] trying to get out of the way.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "I wanted Brother Wayne Lawson
[1:50:25] to come. He'd love to be here today, but
[1:50:28] his father went into hospice care."
[1:50:32] That's end of life care.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; He only has one father. Yeah.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; So maybe next year,
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; maybe another time. But God knew
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; God knew that you needed two two brother
[1:50:46] John's, Jonathan and John. God knew
[1:50:50] there needed to be
[1:50:52] there's faith, there's Peter, there's
[1:50:54] James, there's hope, and there's John.
[1:50:56] That's love.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just need love in the
[1:51:00] box.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; We need honey in the box.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. that statue of a
[1:51:05] perfect man. That's brotherly kindness.
[1:51:07] We need someone that will just say it in
[1:51:09] a way it's like, "Wow, that's in You're
[1:51:11] right. That's and and the lock just
[1:51:14] turned."
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; And then then later you're saying, "Man,
[1:51:18] where have you all been all where have
[1:51:19] you all been in our church? Where have
[1:51:21] y'all been?" It's like, "I've been here,
[1:51:22] but the lights just came on.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Now they're being used. Now they're
[1:51:26] praying. Now it's like, wow, you have a
[1:51:28] special." They actually said, "Thank
[1:51:30] you.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; They're actually helping to clean
[1:51:33] tables.
[1:51:35] You know that young lady, she used to be
[1:51:36] so this and that and flighty. Now she's
[1:51:38] becoming she's becoming a real nice
[1:51:40] young lady, a real godly example. She's
[1:51:43] moving from being a lamb into being a
[1:51:46] real nice sheep. You can What does that?
[1:51:48] The word of God.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; As we grow from year to year,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; you're growing.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just need someone to say
[1:51:57] you're growing.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Since Youth Without Borders, we've gone
[1:52:04] all over the world, literally Africa and
[1:52:06] Europe, and and I've met some of the
[1:52:08] young people, people that you were
[1:52:09] influenced. Now, they're wanting to get
[1:52:11] married and now certain they'll come up
[1:52:12] to me and say, "Thank you."
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying thank you back to you on
[1:52:17] their behalf cuz you provided a platform
[1:52:21] for the Lord Jesus to minister to them.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "I was all alone." or just me and
[1:52:29] my sister, me and my brother. And God
[1:52:31] came to me in my room. I heard the voice
[1:52:34] of God.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Somehow through them wires, somehow
[1:52:37] through all of that and craziness and
[1:52:40] weirdness, 2 in the morning, all alone
[1:52:42] or maybe another brother helping us, the
[1:52:45] message got through.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Bloody, broken, misunderstood.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And whatever's happened since then, you
[1:52:52] say, "It hasn't been an easy road." I
[1:52:54] understand that. None of us are on an
[1:52:56] easy road. We're Christians.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; We're a minority.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; But we're not a victim.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And God gives us words that changes our
[1:53:12] attitude.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Let me just go back. Just give me 60
[1:53:15] seconds on this. You that are always
[1:53:17] upset about children or people or young
[1:53:20] people, people, babes in Christ always
[1:53:22] saying things, do you ought to just be
[1:53:24] thankful you have children. Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; You ought to be thankful there are
[1:53:27] people that want the message you've got.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's some mothers that can't have
[1:53:33] children.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; There's some families that can't have
[1:53:36] children.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; There's some churches that don't have a
[1:53:39] lot of young people in their youth
[1:53:41] group.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And we got 20 people, 30 people, 50
[1:53:48] people, Brother John, maybe 80. Our
[1:53:51] youth group isn't that big. And then and
[1:53:53] then we we all come from different
[1:53:54] backgrounds. Now I'm talking to some of
[1:53:56] you. We come from different backgrounds
[1:53:58] and we're not all close. You know,
[1:53:59] Brother John and this and that. And then
[1:54:01] we can start to almost tear apart and
[1:54:03] fragment because we don't have a strong
[1:54:06] base, you know, and the strong youth.
[1:54:08] And so the people at school becomes our
[1:54:10] friends or the person at the gym, we
[1:54:12] become a we fit in better with people on
[1:54:14] the university campus, you know, we can
[1:54:16] talk to them very openly and nobody's
[1:54:19] calling us boyfriend, girlfriend. But
[1:54:22] you do it at camp and they've already
[1:54:23] got you married with three children.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; What did we do in the message? Why did
[1:54:29] we become a skewed?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; And we laugh, but it's true.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; And some of our young people can feel
[1:54:37] more themselves, out on a university
[1:54:40] campus or out on the workplace with
[1:54:42] people that aren't believers. And and we
[1:54:45] have shoved them out like that
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; because we've made it so weird. Would
[1:54:51] you people of New Zealand please be an
[1:54:53] example and
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; to those and just stop all that? Just
[1:54:57] let them be. Talk to one another.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Well, if our minister said it, maybe it
[1:55:05] would sift down a little bit and and
[1:55:07] moms and dads wouldn't be so weird.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's son was smoking at
[1:55:14] 15.
[1:55:16] His
[1:55:18] 17-year-old daughter was playing rock
[1:55:20] and roll music with her friend up the
[1:55:22] street.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; His other son was wild and crazy and
[1:55:26] rebellious as a I know that's where I
[1:55:28] was born and raised as a teenager.
[1:55:30] There's a lot of us that would have rode
[1:55:32] off brother Brown as being a bad parent.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; One son's smoking, the other one's doing
[1:55:37] this rock and roll. The other one's wild
[1:55:39] and crazy running around this and that
[1:55:41] after he's married this and this and
[1:55:43] this. You'd say, "Man, where is that
[1:55:45] delinquent father? That's your prophet."
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; We begin to realize that we are the
[1:55:50] sheep of his pasture. And we all need
[1:55:53] the Lord.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; There's no big eyes and little you's. We
[1:55:57] need the Lord. [cheering]
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; But let me say this. It's not all we
[1:56:01] need you. We need you. I'm desperate for
[1:56:04] you. We have him.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; He's right here in this service.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; He's walking up and down the aisles.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; He's in our bedrooms. He's in our
[1:56:13] bathrooms.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; He's in the trail. He's walking down the
[1:56:17] road today. [screaming]
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; He's in the where we're eating food.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; If you'd look close enough, he's in your
[1:56:27] brother.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He's in your sister.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; But if you look even closer, he's in
[1:56:32] you.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the most difficult thing. We
[1:56:36] struggle with that.
[1:56:39] And the Holy Spirit's just trying to
[1:56:41] bring all the atmospheres that are
[1:56:42] fighting and he's saying, "That's why I
[1:56:45] am here." Look in verse 12.
[1:56:48] Matthew 18:12, if you have your Bible,
[1:56:51] how think ye?
[1:56:54] If a man have a hundred sheep, and one
[1:56:56] of them be gone astray,
[1:56:59] does he not leave
[1:57:01] the 99? Is that what your Bible says?
[1:57:05] A good shepherd would leave 99
[1:57:09] and goeth into the mountains and seeketh
[1:57:12] that which has gone astray.
[1:57:14] Bad sheep. Bad sheep. You are very bad.
[1:57:18] So we're going to put you to the
[1:57:21] sidelines.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Where did we go astray?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Where did we lose the goal? Yeah.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Why have we become so callous and hard
[1:57:35] as older ones?
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; When we ought to be the ones that are
[1:57:40] the most gentle and long-suffering and
[1:57:44] forgiving.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; If you have what you say you have, the
[1:57:48] greatest message that ever's been given,
[1:57:51] then let's see it in one another's
[1:57:53] lives. And then if we make a mistake,
[1:57:55] just ask for forgiveness and say, "I am
[1:57:58] sorry. I am wrong. Take that out of me.
[1:58:02] I don't want that in my life. And let
[1:58:04] the Lord do that.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; I know this is really, really simple
[1:58:12] today.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; We're like sheep 101. We're like back to
[1:58:16] sheeperd 101. But that's what some of us
[1:58:18] need.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; We need our religious little tower
[1:58:21] shaken sometimes.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe God's dealing with that young man,
[1:58:25] dealing with that young lady. Maybe that
[1:58:27] mother needs this today. Maybe that
[1:58:29] brother needs exactly what brother John
[1:58:31] is saying. And he'll bring a brother
[1:58:33] from over the ocean to say what we
[1:58:35] needed to hear.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother John's being very real.
[1:58:39] I I think I've got money in the bank
[1:58:40] with some of you
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; spiritually speaking. We've got money in
[1:58:44] the bank.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; That's a secular phrase, but that means
[1:58:47] I can say things and get away with it
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; because you know I love you and you love
[1:58:52] me. God bless you for that. Another
[1:58:54] brother say the same thing. You'd be
[1:58:56] offended and get your noise at a joint
[1:58:58] center. I'm not coming back to the next
[1:59:00] service he's preaching.
[1:59:02] I'm kind of sick today. Well, I I am
[1:59:05] too. It's because you've allowed your
[1:59:07] critical spirit to affect everybody.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; And don't sit there with your arms all
[1:59:13] folded
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; and then want your young people to do
[1:59:16] this.
[1:59:20] [cheering]
[1:59:24] Oh, bless God, brother, brother. You're
[1:59:26] really down here in the kitty pool
[1:59:28] today, aren't you?
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Well, weren't you a kitty one time?
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Weren't you one years, two year? Wasn't
[1:59:34] you a lamb before?
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Let me remind you of John when Jesus
[1:59:39] said, "Feed my lambs."
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; That was number one.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Feed my sheep."
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; I know we went there and that was a long
[1:59:47] time ago, but feed my lambs. Feed my
[1:59:49] sheep. Feed my sheep means feed the
[1:59:51] sheep,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; sheep food,
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; not jokes,
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; not personality,
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; not making them New Zealand great again.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Let's all make New Zealand great again.
[2:00:07] You know, you're not going to do that.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; The word's already said it's falling
[2:00:11] apart.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Say, I'm holding on to it. Bless God.
[2:00:14] Hallelujah. Yeah. Bless God. Hallelujah.
[2:00:17] You better hold on to Christ.
[2:00:19] say, "But I gave up a long time ago on
[2:00:22] that." Well, he's holding on to you
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; and and you get wayward and start having
[2:00:28] this old mentality and this spirit.
[2:00:31] Nobody wants to be around you anymore
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; cuz you're always talking negative about
[2:00:36] everybody else's church and their women,
[2:00:40] their young people. Yeah, Brother John,
[2:00:42] but if you really only knew this. Let me
[2:00:44] And God knows everything.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[2:00:50] I mean, who's the Pope in New Zealand
[2:00:52] I'm supposed to talk to about marriages
[2:00:54] and young people or
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; can this couple mar and who who's who is
[2:00:58] in in New Zealand? What what city is it
[2:01:01] now?
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; You know, years ago it was this certain
[2:01:04] city and that certain place and that
[2:01:06] certain pastor.
[2:01:08] I'm being honest. Who who can I talk to
[2:01:10] that will say, "Well, over in New
[2:01:12] Zealand, this is how we do it here." And
[2:01:15] then in heaven, we're going to have the
[2:01:17] Africans and we're going to have the
[2:01:18] European. That's not it.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Heaven is going to be one big place
[2:01:23] where we're all the same.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not discounting that. You know, the
[2:01:31] Africans have the moves and
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; it just flows through them.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And us white folk, we're starchy and
[2:01:38] stiff and we'll look at it like this.
[2:01:40] You know,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; I'm calling you sheep
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; of his pastor.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; It could be high pitched, it can be low
[2:01:54] pitched.
[2:01:56] But I'm talking about in verse 12, one
[2:01:58] sheep that gets astray, starts doing
[2:02:01] things wrong, starts going down in the
[2:02:03] thickets, going over the cliff,
[2:02:07] and it gets rainy and tornadoes. I
[2:02:10] understand there was an earthquake in
[2:02:12] New Zealand at 9:30 last night. Does
[2:02:14] anybody else know about that? I'm
[2:02:16] getting a text from thousands of and
[2:02:19] there a 5.0 5.1 is coming right down
[2:02:23] through Wellington right around. Did
[2:02:25] y'all know that?
[2:02:29] It was probably Brother Jonathan in
[2:02:31] close of the service. You know,
[2:02:33] [cheering]
[2:02:35] I'm serious. [applause]
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; It shook us up here in in our camp
[2:02:44] meeting and they registered on the RTOR
[2:02:46] scale.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I'm being serious. I had somebody send
[2:02:49] me a text and it's like, it goes right
[2:02:51] down through here. I'm like, "Wow,
[2:02:52] that's incredible.
[2:02:54] I knew it was brother John closing the
[2:02:56] service last night. He's powerful.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; You know, we live in Seattle near
[2:03:04] Seattle, Washington, and there's huge
[2:03:06] big stadiums. They have football
[2:03:08] stadium, NFL stadium that seats
[2:03:10] thousands and thousands of people. They
[2:03:12] have a ba baseball stadium with a
[2:03:14] retractable roof. They got hockey team.
[2:03:16] They got all of this. And in the in the
[2:03:19] football stadium, it they actually
[2:03:20] designed it like this so that the noise
[2:03:24] is so powerful.
[2:03:26] They they register the fans when they
[2:03:29] roar on the RTOR scale. It's so loud.
[2:03:33] And in in our American football, there's
[2:03:35] 11 players on the field. Just give me 60
[2:03:38] seconds. Okay. Talk about sports a
[2:03:40] little bit. 11 players. And then they
[2:03:42] call it the 12th man because it's the
[2:03:44] crowd and they're so loud and they're so
[2:03:47] cheering like the opposing team can't
[2:03:49] hear the play and what's going on. They
[2:03:51] call it the 12th man. The crowd actually
[2:03:54] registers on a RTOR scale.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And I thought my I wonder about our
[2:03:59] church services sometimes. You know,
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; even the church mice have to be quiet
[2:04:05] sometimes and go. You could hear a pin
[2:04:07] drop.
[2:04:15] There's times we need to rejoice and be
[2:04:17] happy and thank the Lord. And there's
[2:04:19] other times we need to be quiet and let
[2:04:21] the word go deeper.
[2:04:25] Sometimes the bat of a sheep and the
[2:04:29] moan of a cry
[2:04:32] is a signal of distress.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; How we doing on time?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; We doing okay?
[2:04:40] Sometimes people can be going through
[2:04:42] things
[2:04:44] and if you'd really listen, they're
[2:04:46] distressing. They're sending out a
[2:04:47] distress signal.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Would somebody listen?
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Does anybody know?
[2:04:55] I'm lost.
[2:04:59] And they may never say that, but the
[2:05:02] English language, French language,
[2:05:03] German, whatever you're from, but that's
[2:05:06] what you can just see.
[2:05:09] There are sheep that's lost. They're
[2:05:10] astray. I was lost and undone without
[2:05:14] God or his son. And if you've been like
[2:05:17] one of those, and we all have,
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; I said we all have.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; We all like sheep had gone astray, then
[2:05:25] you ought to have the bigger heart for
[2:05:27] someone that is rebellious and stubborn
[2:05:29] and they're not going to listen and
[2:05:31] they're going to just put it down even
[2:05:32] harder. Then he said not to fold my
[2:05:35] arms. I'm going to fold my I'm going to
[2:05:36] lift up my elbow.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; and and they're getting worse and it's
[2:05:42] going worse.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Don't give up hope, friends.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've been that way, too.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; You've heard things and you've done just
[2:05:54] the opposite.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; You've been in good meetings. You've had
[2:05:57] good pastors, good churches, and then
[2:05:59] sometimes years go by and we get
[2:06:01] complacent. We get lazy. We want them to
[2:06:04] do all the preaching, all the studying,
[2:06:06] and we become lazy and doy and slothful
[2:06:09] and indifferent. We don't want to come
[2:06:12] early no more. Why don't you come early?
[2:06:14] Everybody just sitting there doing
[2:06:15] nothing, catching a little rest. I'm
[2:06:17] catching a little rest here, brother
[2:06:19] John. You're not fervent anymore. You're
[2:06:21] not praying for the for those that are
[2:06:24] serving.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Then we wonder why these spirits have
[2:06:27] come in.
[2:06:28] I pray God you'd turn the volume up on
[2:06:31] that microphone to that those that are
[2:06:33] desperate, those that are needy,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; those that have a real need and they're
[2:06:38] crying out to God. They might be sitting
[2:06:40] there just very very quiet. They're not
[2:06:42] amening today. They're in receive mode,
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; okay? They're just they're just soaking
[2:06:49] it in. They're soaking it up. They're
[2:06:51] about ready to make the the the greatest
[2:06:53] decision of their whole life.
[2:06:57] Then let them listen.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Let them hear the word.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Say, "No, we've moved it up now to the
[2:07:03] 90 and9, brother." Bless God.
[2:07:05] Hallelujah. That's not bless God.
[2:07:07] Hallelujah. You're not being like Jesus.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; He said he'll leave the 909.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; In verse 13, he said, "If he go, so be
[2:07:16] that he find it. Verily I say unto you,
[2:07:18] he rejoicth more of that sheep than of
[2:07:22] the nine and nine which went not
[2:07:23] astray."
[2:07:25] Man, this is really simple, isn't it?
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; All heaven is like busting loose and
[2:07:34] we're down here. Oh man. Oh man. So
[2:07:37] bored.
[2:07:40] So bored. So bored. When's it going to
[2:07:43] be over? And all heaven's just busting
[2:07:45] loose. And the angels that have been
[2:07:47] trying to deal with all of this person
[2:07:49] and move them toward the Lord and move
[2:07:51] them toward righteousness, they're like
[2:07:53] saying, "Yes. Yes. Just a little
[2:07:55] further. Just another song.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; And you already ch clocked out
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; 30 minutes ago.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; You're already eating your lunch and
[2:08:04] drinking your coffee.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; And you're there's a hungry sheep and a
[2:08:09] hungry lamb
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; that is just going like this. It's like,
[2:08:12] "Oh, God, how did he know that about me?
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; I don't want anyone here to think that
[2:08:19] I'm backslid." So you just sit there.
[2:08:21] Sit there. Sit there. Go like this. You
[2:08:24] know, maybe tears coming down. You know,
[2:08:27] get yourself together, son.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Big boys don't cry. Who told you that
[2:08:33] lie?
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; It'd do good. It would do good for all
[2:08:37] of us brothers to weep a little bit
[2:08:39] more.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Cry a little bit.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; It'd be good if some of our deacons just
[2:08:43] let out a great big hallelujah.
[2:08:45] [screaming]
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Some of our brothers, some of our
[2:08:48] parents said, "Yes, Lord.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:08:53] Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; And get more of the nature of Christ on
[2:08:57] us.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going for the one. I'm going for the
[2:09:00] one.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going for the one. Man, you're so
[2:09:05] focused. Man, you're so passionate. Yep.
[2:09:08] We're going for the one.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, but if there's 200 people
[2:09:12] here and there's 99 out of 100, that
[2:09:14] means there's two people. God's coming
[2:09:17] for you. [cheering]
[2:09:19] [applause]
[2:09:25] And and by Sunday, there might be 300
[2:09:27] here. I understand.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Well, that means there's going to be
[2:09:30] three people God's going to be dealing
[2:09:32] with really strong. And that minister's
[2:09:34] got to stay focused and the musicians
[2:09:36] got to be in tune and everybody's got to
[2:09:39] be in one mind for three people.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Say, "But come on. We got 297, Brother
[2:09:44] John." No, there's three. And the Holy
[2:09:46] Spirit's made all of this. He set up
[2:09:49] everything. He arranged everything
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; when are you just going to humble
[2:10:00] yourself
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; and say, "I need more of Jesus."
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; What are we going to have to go through
[2:10:06] for us to just learn to let go and let
[2:10:09] God?
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; I know we say those phrases, but let go
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; and surrender.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; You can do that. Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; You can do that.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; God gave you two hands.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And if they can scream and yell at a
[2:10:24] rugby game
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; and get all in the spirit of it, surely
[2:10:28] we can say, "Send your presence, Lord,
[2:10:31] into our lives, into our down into that
[2:10:33] realm. Go down underneath that place,
[2:10:35] that sacred place."
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; It's like a little button. Brother
[2:10:41] Brandham said, "It's in your soul.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; That's a little something.
[2:10:50] You ought to be thankful you didn't die
[2:10:52] as an infant.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; You ought to be thankful as a little
[2:10:55] girl, little boy that car didn't come
[2:10:58] out of nowhere and crash and take your
[2:11:00] life and we all had a funeral service at
[2:11:02] some of us get so down in the mouth and
[2:11:04] so negative about the food or this and
[2:11:06] we got to be thankful we have any food.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; You see what's happening in Hamas and
[2:11:12] Palestine and Israel. That's horrible.
[2:11:14] War is horrible. Do we agree?
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Now I'm listening really close what
[2:11:19] you're going to say about it. War is
[2:11:21] horrible.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Don't bring that into the message.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Don't bring your politics into the
[2:11:27] message.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; You keep it right at home. Keep it to
[2:11:31] yourself.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Especially at camps like this.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; We need to be brothers and sisters to
[2:11:36] one another.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; All those bad feelings and poison, keep
[2:11:40] it to yourself. We don't want to hear
[2:11:42] it.
[2:11:47] I'm glad I got money in the bank. Amen.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Some of us need to say, "Preach it,
[2:11:51] Brother John."
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 14. Even so, it is not the will of
[2:12:00] your father which is in heaven
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; that one of these little ones should
[2:12:05] perish.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Let's all go like this. Just one. Just
[2:12:08] one.
[2:12:09] If I would have said a hundred, you'd
[2:12:11] have been putting up your feet and toes
[2:12:12] and borrowing from your friend. Just
[2:12:14] one.
[2:12:25] ers and are you walking in a circle with
[2:12:28] those other brothers and that's all
[2:12:30] nonsense.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; You know, sisters, we get all these
[2:12:34] chats and we start this and that and
[2:12:38] if you're white, it's like, no, we we
[2:12:40] don't really see it the same like that.
[2:12:42] And so our little chat, we don't have
[2:12:44] anybody from this certain nationality.
[2:12:47] I'm just going to go down like this. We
[2:12:49] don't have anybody from that nationality
[2:12:51] in our in our little group. Well, shame
[2:12:53] on you.
[2:12:56] Amen.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy,
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; had mercy for you.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; He had mercy for me.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; And I just want to praise his name today
[2:13:08] that God's mercy didn't leave me out
[2:13:10] there in the world somewhere.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; God delivered you from drinking,
[2:13:14] smoking,
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; and sexual sin.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; And then that's happening right in your
[2:13:19] church or in your in your family, and
[2:13:21] you're wanting to write them off. Shame
[2:13:23] on you. God rich in mercy needs to come
[2:13:26] down in you and be the mercy. You be the
[2:13:30] mercy.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And if we would have had five services,
[2:13:35] I would have preached on the mercy seat.
[2:13:37] It's not somewhere over in Israel. It's
[2:13:39] not somewhere in Jeffersonville, Tucson.
[2:13:42] The bride is the mercy.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Then can I ask you, where's the mercy?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Where's the forgiveness?
[2:13:56] This is a good scripture. Isaiah 53:6.
[2:14:00] All we like sheep have gone astray.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; We have turned everyone to his own way.
[2:14:06] And the Lord hath laid on him the
[2:14:08] iniquity of us all.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; We all like sheep has gone astray.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; But I didn't say you were a goat. Yeah,
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; we didn't pull over one time
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; or a field of goats
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; or dinosaurs.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; No alligators.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; It was all sheep.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's what we're focused
[2:14:31] on.
[2:14:34] Where we're looking for a place to end.
[2:14:37] Some of you can go and scratch your head
[2:14:38] and say, "My, that was so, so simple."
[2:14:43] We're looking for tonight's service for
[2:14:45] what the Lord would have for us. These
[2:14:48] lo innocent, lovely lambs, great
[2:14:50] creatures.
[2:14:52] Wish me had more time to study that
[2:14:54] nature of the lamb. It's wonderful. God
[2:14:56] likened us to lambs. The lamb is an
[2:14:59] animal that cannot make his own way. And
[2:15:03] quicker, sooner rather that we find out
[2:15:05] that we can't make our own way.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; We can't make our own way.
[2:15:13] We can't make our own way.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Let's make it personal. I can't make my
[2:15:20] Amen. Don't say it cuz Brother John said
[2:15:22] it. Just say, "You know what, brother
[2:15:24] John? I've seen it. I cannot find my
[2:15:26] way. I don't even know the way."
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Now you're getting more like Solomon.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; When God asked him, "What what do you
[2:15:35] want of me?" And he said, "I am but a
[2:15:37] child.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to go out or to come
[2:15:40] in." And he wasn't a little child,
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; but he had brought his humility down to
[2:15:46] such a it wasn't his age cuz he wasn't a
[2:15:49] little child,
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; but in his heart,
[2:15:54] he had humbled himself to say, "Lord, I
[2:15:57] can't go in or go out. I need your
[2:15:58] wisdom."
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; And that's in the Old Testament.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; What about the New Testament?
[2:16:07] My,
[2:16:09] let that great shepherd come down. That
[2:16:11] blading that's going down in a ditch
[2:16:13] somewhere was a young lamb and the old
[2:16:15] you had went away with the rest of the
[2:16:17] herd and the little fellow was helpless.
[2:16:19] And how I picked him up and packed him
[2:16:21] to his mother and how he just laid in my
[2:16:25] arms and I thought, "Oh, God, that was
[2:16:27] me." One day I was all together undone
[2:16:31] and you picked me up into your arms and
[2:16:33] packed me.
[2:16:34] My our prophet even was like that.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Then surely we've been feeding off this
[2:16:39] message all these years. We can become
[2:16:41] marked like that. I'm going to today
[2:16:43] have time for that little girl,
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; that little bully,
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; that teenager.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; I want to say this publicly. We're we're
[2:16:52] not against you.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, myself, we're here for
[2:16:57] you.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; We brought our wives. We we we're here
[2:17:01] to support you. We're not here to preach
[2:17:03] at you. We're with you.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; We're going to go back to our problems
[2:17:08] and our and you won't hear about our
[2:17:09] problems.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; We're here to minister to you.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; We're here to get down to the place
[2:17:15] where God can deal with your life and
[2:17:18] your need and your situation and what
[2:17:23] you're going through.
[2:17:28] So, can you just help me by moving to
[2:17:30] the next slide? I want you to just see
[2:17:32] here. Can you help me there?
[2:17:37] So, in New Zealand, we've heard the
[2:17:38] sheep are calling, the lambs are
[2:17:40] bleeding. Let's respond.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Let's answer.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm being very humble with
[2:17:47] you. We said we had three services,
[2:17:49] Brother Jonathan, but some aren't even
[2:17:51] here yet. They might only hear one,
[2:17:54] maybe two services. Some have to go home
[2:17:56] on Monday. Some might hear tonight,
[2:17:59] Sunday morning, Sunday night. That's
[2:18:00] three. The whole driving 5 hours, 3
[2:18:03] hours, 2 hours, all your money, all your
[2:18:06] time. Let's put it in together and say,
[2:18:08] "Lord, we want to see your glory come
[2:18:11] down. [cheering]
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; We've had enough of men and women and
[2:18:15] glory to this church and glory to that
[2:18:18] minister. It's glory to Christ.
[2:18:23] Just put some gasoline on the fire and
[2:18:26] and let the Holy Spirit just lick up all
[2:18:28] the the rocks and lick up all the
[2:18:30] sacrifices.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me today?
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Just lick up all of our flesh, all of
[2:18:37] our nonsense, all of my worldly dreams,
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; all of my ambitions, and all of my
[2:18:43] carnal frolic that I've been guilty of.
[2:18:46] Just consume it, Lord. Amen.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Let's finish strong today.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; God's heard your cry. He's heard the
[2:18:54] bleeding of the sheep.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Can you go to the next slide? Cuz here
[2:18:59] it just messed up here again. He's
[2:19:02] talking about this little lamb bleeding
[2:19:04] and he was watching it there in Africa
[2:19:07] and it was so peaceable and things and
[2:19:09] then all of a sudden it got nervous and
[2:19:11] he wondered what the matter was and a
[2:19:14] little sheep cannot find his way back
[2:19:16] wherever he comes from. He's lost
[2:19:19] completely.
[2:19:23] [screaming]
[2:19:30] Stop it.
[2:19:32] [screaming]
[2:19:37] What else do you want to hear?
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Rock and roll music.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Some bad joke.
[2:19:45] No. Lord, turn up the volume.
[2:19:53] Just play a faster song. [screaming]
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I'm making a fool of myself
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; for your sake.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; We need the Lord to turn up the volume
[2:20:06] of that young lady, that young man, or
[2:20:09] maybe it's an even a person that's
[2:20:11] older. You say, "I would never go
[2:20:12] forward because the altar is for
[2:20:14] sinners." Who told you that? The altar
[2:20:17] is for consecration.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; It would do some of your young people
[2:20:21] good if some of you older ones were the
[2:20:23] first one at the altar.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, why do we got to You don't have to
[2:20:27] go up there.
[2:20:29] There's nothing sacred about an altar
[2:20:31] call
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; if you go back and live the same.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; I said there's nothing sacred about an
[2:20:37] altar call.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Wow, y'all got quiet on that one. Did
[2:20:42] Jesus ever have one?
[2:20:47] I believe in altar calls.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; I do. I believe in prayer lines. What
[2:20:54] the Lord would lead you to do that.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; But I believe we need to walk in the
[2:20:59] spirit and hear the blading of our
[2:21:01] sheep. And what's the really the need of
[2:21:03] the hour
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; if they're wandering away from the
[2:21:05] corral and and this young lamb of sheep
[2:21:08] was it couldn't smell its enemy like a
[2:21:11] deer or something like that to know that
[2:21:13] death is near. But there was a lion
[2:21:15] slipping up coming easily. He could
[2:21:17] smell the sheep. He was coming to get
[2:21:18] the lamb. And the little fellow become
[2:21:20] nervous. You couldn't see the reason
[2:21:22] why. But it was death lurking so near
[2:21:25] that he was nervous.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Can you go to um slide number 23?
[2:21:31] I'll give you that title. And then the
[2:21:33] next slide. I wanted to show you this
[2:21:34] before we leave. Next slide. I wanted
[2:21:37] this to be the visual of this camp of
[2:21:40] the old and the young generation. Next
[2:21:43] slide. I wanted that to be very common
[2:21:47] even this afternoon and tomorrow that we
[2:21:49] learn
[2:21:51] the old generation and the new
[2:21:52] generation.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's all that person needs
[2:21:56] is just a hand on their shoulder.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; And us men, we like to fix everything.
[2:22:04] God wired us that way. And women like to
[2:22:07] just listen
[2:22:08] and get emotional about it. Were they
[2:22:12] nice to you? How did they say it? Oh,
[2:22:15] well they did. And and the all the
[2:22:18] sisters are like, "Well, how did you
[2:22:20] take it?
[2:22:24] Do they smile or were they angry?
[2:22:27] It's all taken care of." Well, I just
[2:22:28] really want to know
[2:22:31] because God made them like that.
[2:22:34] We're at a family camp, right? I've been
[2:22:37] to family camps and heard family camps
[2:22:39] and there's nothing said about the
[2:22:40] family,
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; nothing said about young people,
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; nothing said about husbands and wives.
[2:22:46] We heard that last night. We're hearing
[2:22:48] it this morning. God's weaving it
[2:22:50] through at all the services that he
[2:22:52] cares.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; He He's got your number.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; He knows all that you're going through.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that today? So, let's join
[2:23:02] the next slide. I wanted you to see
[2:23:04] that. Let's be the type of men and
[2:23:07] women,
[2:23:09] the older generation, having
[2:23:10] understanding, coming across to one
[2:23:13] another, not always down, but coming
[2:23:17] across. That's the nature of Christ.
[2:23:21] Next slide, our last slide of a of the
[2:23:23] of a quote. When brother Brandham said,
[2:23:25] and Christ is the mystery, we are his
[2:23:28] victory.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; The church is his victory.
[2:23:32] We come forth in this last days with
[2:23:34] this glorious gospel showing his
[2:23:36] victory.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; He died for this purpose and we are
[2:23:40] proof of his victory.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see him coming down and
[2:23:44] living among the church, that's his
[2:23:47] victory.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise God."
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; I am his victory.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Then he has come to me in my weakness
[2:23:57] and made me strong. God is helping me
[2:24:00] through. My help is from the Lord. The
[2:24:03] Lord is my helper. The Lord is my
[2:24:06] counselor. The Lord is my healer.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my savior.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; The Lord is redeeming me back to me, my
[2:24:14] ought to be place. The Lord has got my
[2:24:17] case.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; He's got my number. Why don't you let me
[2:24:20] go? Just get away. He's not going to let
[2:24:22] you go.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; He'll go around the back door, go around
[2:24:26] the side door, come down the chimney,
[2:24:28] whatever. You're a son and daughter of
[2:24:30] his. You're a sheep. You're a lamb.
[2:24:34] He has heard your cry.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; He's heard your call.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; The lack of character, the lack of
[2:24:41] morality only is like crying out for
[2:24:45] more morality. More character. Amen.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; My I wanted to speak about humility and
[2:24:55] those that were broken and those that
[2:24:56] were
[2:24:58] to this person will I look in Isaiah
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; who was contrite
[2:25:05] and broken and that trembled at that at
[2:25:08] my word.
[2:25:10] But I promised you your lunch. So we got
[2:25:13] to leave that. But I'll leave you with
[2:25:15] that. say, "All I had to offer him was
[2:25:18] brokenness,
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; a contrite spirit." That's Psalms 34:18.
[2:25:24] Psalms 51:17.
[2:25:26] A broken spirit and a broken and a
[2:25:28] contrite heart.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't throw you away. He didn't call
[2:25:32] you dung.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; That's my son out there. That's my
[2:25:36] daughter. I wonder how my son's doing
[2:25:39] tonight. The prodical son's mother. I
[2:25:42] wonder where he's at tonight. I wonder
[2:25:44] where she's at tonight, Lord. Little did
[2:25:47] they know, the heart of of the Lord
[2:25:49] Jesus was going to turn their heart and
[2:25:52] a new spirit. Well, he was going to put
[2:25:54] inside of them and just break them and
[2:25:56] say, "Well, I guess I'll just come back
[2:25:57] and sit in the back row somewhere. I'll
[2:25:59] just come back and be like one of your
[2:26:01] servants or something." And the whole
[2:26:03] the whole response was totally opposite.
[2:26:06] It's like, "Here comes my dad. Here
[2:26:08] comes my mom." And and don't forget the
[2:26:10] the elder brother there. He's got a bad
[2:26:12] attitude a little bit till the father
[2:26:14] came out and talked to him.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; And we don't know the rest of the story.
[2:26:18] But I hope I'm speaking to believers
[2:26:20] that would say that older brother came
[2:26:22] in too to the house and said, "You know
[2:26:24] what? I had a bad spirit. Let's go. Come
[2:26:26] on." I mean, we're family.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; And yeah, you heard us. And yeah, the
[2:26:31] last years have been miserable around
[2:26:33] here. And what did you do to mom and
[2:26:36] dad? You Well, talk about it back there,
[2:26:38] but here we are in the house. Amen.
[2:26:40] We're rejoicing.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; We're here to welcome you back.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Say, "But they don't deserve it. Neither
[2:26:50] do you."
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; I I I believe the Lord's talking to us,
[2:26:55] younger ones and older ones.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; That we need to be less hardened and
[2:27:00] harsh
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; and we need to move under the nature of
[2:27:03] the Holy Spirit.
[2:27:06] And don't be like David when the time
[2:27:09] was coming for the temple and God said,
[2:27:11] "You've shed too much blood. You've been
[2:27:13] too much of a fighter. I'm going to have
[2:27:15] to use someone else that is a man of
[2:27:17] peace." The new generation and the bride
[2:27:20] of Christ and their ministry is handled
[2:27:23] by peace.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; It's not a bunch of old fighters and
[2:27:26] warriors. And that's brother Brandham's
[2:27:28] phrase, old fighters. It's not that
[2:27:29] they're old in age.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Some of our young ministers have become
[2:27:33] pulpit fighters. And that's not the
[2:27:36] nature of Christ.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; We need to learn to turn these corners
[2:27:43] well
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; and let the new generation have peace.
[2:27:49] God's peace
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; declared over the whole congregation,
[2:27:53] over your home, over a troubled mental
[2:27:56] case and anxiety
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; and just they're talking and it's not
[2:28:00] making sense and your heart is being
[2:28:02] rent out of you and you're and you just
[2:28:04] feel like saying, "Lord, where did we go
[2:28:06] wrong?" And the Holy Spirit is saying,
[2:28:08] "I you are my victory. I'm going to work
[2:28:11] this out for my glory.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; I'm just looking to you, Dad and Mom, to
[2:28:15] give it to me.
[2:28:17] Yes,
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; I wish that we weren't so time bound
[2:28:24] creatures.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Our last slide. Just go ahead and move
[2:28:28] it to that. I hope in New Zealand that
[2:28:30] during this family camp, God can let us
[2:28:33] be more spiritual with one another.
[2:28:37] If we're going to live in eternity
[2:28:39] together,
[2:28:41] there will be a bride that is learning
[2:28:43] to live on earth
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; with that kind of character.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; We don't even deserve to be in the same
[2:28:53] room with with you.
[2:28:55] We don't even deserve to be in the same
[2:28:57] room with brothers and sisters. I'm
[2:28:59] talking about the blood of Jesus.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; Say, if I just had a vial of his blood,
[2:29:03] I would keep it. I No. And he said that
[2:29:05] you become the blood.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; The body of Christ is the blood.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; So be careful how you handle her, how
[2:29:12] you talk to her.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Stop bullying my people
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; or I'll sideline you and I'll put you in
[2:29:18] the dugout.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; I'll raise up another generation if I
[2:29:22] have to.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; To talk to my bride the way she deserves
[2:29:25] to be talked to
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; woo her heart
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; to say, "Come on, boys.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, girls.
[2:29:34] and show by example that we're leaders.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Not squirt a little water over here,
[2:29:40] squirt a little water over here, try
[2:29:41] this over here, that. No, but come on,
[2:29:44] bride.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, sheep.
[2:29:47] Let's go.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; And some of you are saying that about
[2:29:51] lunch. It's like, let's go. And I'm
[2:29:53] like, let's go. Let my people go.
[2:30:06] Amen. Brother Isaac, can you come and
[2:30:08] our wonderful musicians and those that
[2:30:12] need to close the service?
[2:30:15] Have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own
[2:30:17] way. Thou art the potter, we are the
[2:30:21] clay.
[2:30:22] Mold us and shape us after your will.
[2:30:25] While I am waiting, yielded. You know
[2:30:27] that song?
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:30] My thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:30:33] Thank you, Lord. Who believes there's
[2:30:35] going to be a bride out of New Zealand?
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Just raise your hand with a vote of
[2:30:39] confidence. There's going to be a bride
[2:30:41] out of New Zealand.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "But they're getting out of step or
[2:30:49] this is that." Well, just scream like a
[2:30:51] get back in line. Let's go, bride.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Tell her who she is. minister who she
[2:30:58] is.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; That's our whole mission is is to tell
[2:31:03] the bride who she is, encourage her.
[2:31:05] Let's get into our place. Let's get back
[2:31:07] to the fold so the shepherd, he can lay
[2:31:09] back over. He's the door of the
[2:31:10] sheepfold. He just lays over and says,
[2:31:12] "All is well. I got all this. What about
[2:31:16] the wolves, Brother John? What about the
[2:31:19] tigers?" I was talking to some of you
[2:31:21] young ladies down there. I said, "Is
[2:31:23] there any tigers and lions around here?"
[2:31:25] We're walking across that little area
[2:31:27] going into the this auditorium here. I'm
[2:31:29] like, "Wow, do y'all have dinosaurs in
[2:31:31] New Zealand?" Snakes.
[2:31:34] Oh, no. No, we don't. Praise God.
[2:31:38] And the Lord's like saying, "You're
[2:31:40] going to walk right down through this
[2:31:41] valley of death, but don't you fear. I'm
[2:31:44] going to be with you."
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Say, "But I there's Warren. They're
[2:31:47] fighting. The lions are after me. The
[2:31:49] hounds of hell. Don't don't worry,
[2:31:52] little sister.
[2:31:54] If you could see in that other
[2:31:55] dimension,
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; there's another great big lion. There's
[2:31:58] another great big dog that's already
[2:32:00] barking. And
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; y'all know that. You've heard that
[2:32:03] story, right? That that lady, young
[2:32:05] teenager was coming from the prayer
[2:32:07] meeting. Was coming from the prayer
[2:32:09] meeting. She was walking by. This great
[2:32:10] big dog came out there and she was so my
[2:32:13] here comes this big dog.
[2:32:17] My she's coming from the prayer meeting.
[2:32:19] This teenager and all of a sudden this
[2:32:21] big dog came running.
[2:32:23] And right at that moment there just came
[2:32:25] up. This other presence and this other
[2:32:27] being
[2:32:29] I think it was like a German shepherd
[2:32:30] just came right up there and stood there
[2:32:32] and that other dog ran away. That was
[2:32:34] the Lord allowed that to happen. I go
[2:32:37] before you. The Lord goes before you.
[2:32:40] Don't worry about next Tuesday, next
[2:32:42] Wednesday, your bills. What's going to
[2:32:43] happen with this? Just give that to the
[2:32:45] Lord right now. just our posture needs
[2:32:47] to be more like this instead of I got
[2:32:50] this and we're going to do this and here

[2:33:33] to know that. God bless you. We can do
[2:33:37] that in in the in 10 minutes when we go

[2:33:45] that brother, that family, you can just
[2:33:47] go talk to them a little bit. How you
[2:33:48] been doing? How's your family? What
[2:33:52] grade you in in school? You know, God
[2:33:54] bless you all today. And you can just
[2:33:56] have a different atmosphere.
[2:33:59] You understand that? That's the way
[2:34:01] Jesus is. What song are we singing,
[2:34:03] Brother Isaac?
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's stand.
[2:34:07] Let's stand and sing this with brother
[2:34:09] Isaac in the worship.
[2:34:14] For have thine own way,
[2:34:20] Lord.
[2:34:23] Have thine own way.
[2:34:32] Thou art the father.
[2:34:36] [music]
[2:34:40] I am
[2:34:42] the
[2:34:45] mold me and make me.

[2:34:53] [music] me
[2:34:57] after
[2:34:58] I [singing]
[2:35:01] [music]
[2:35:05] while [singing]
[2:35:06] I am waiting [music]
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Have th I known [music]
[2:35:26] that change.

[2:35:58] [music]
[2:36:05] [music and singing]
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:36:18] [music]
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Let's just all bow our heads. Can we
[2:36:26] sing that song that we did at um I give
[2:36:28] myself away. I give myself away.
[2:36:33] I wonder if with our heads bowed if we
[2:36:35] can just
[2:36:42] Just pause for a moment in our busy
[2:36:44] lives,
[2:36:47] our busy Saturday.
[2:36:50] We'll never have Saturday morning again
[2:36:54] like we did this morning. It's the Lord
[2:36:57] talking [music] to us along the road.
[2:37:06] May the Lord answer your prayers.
[2:37:09] You that are calling, you that are
[2:37:10] crying, you that are burdened. May the
[2:37:13] Lord answer your prayers,
[2:37:17] may the Lord give you the desire of his
[2:37:19] heart
[2:37:22] and his will be done in the matter
[2:37:26] and not just what you or I would want
[2:37:28] but what he knows what is best.
[2:37:34] That is perfect faith. when we are
[2:37:36] actually start [music] praying in a
[2:37:38] channel that it's him praying through
[2:37:41] us. And yes, we would have liked for
[2:37:43] sister Christine to never have got in
[2:37:45] that vehicle. Yes, we would have loved
[2:37:48] to spare this brother that injury. Yes,
[2:37:52] we wouldn't want to see this church go
[2:37:54] through that situation. Yes, we wouldn't
[2:37:57] want that family to have to deal with
[2:37:59] that. But the Lord knows. He knows. And
[2:38:04] there has to be a release in us as sons
[2:38:07] and daughters of God to say, you know,
[2:38:09] Lord, and I commit it to you,
[2:38:16] Lord. Bless our afternoon together.
[2:38:19] We're going to be with brothers and
[2:38:21] sisters and some on the internet are
[2:38:23] going to be logging off in their
[2:38:25] different countries and
[2:38:27] places or cities or churches.
[2:38:32] There's a lot, Lord, that we could say
[2:38:34] to be critical of things and one
[2:38:36] another. Even our services, I'm sure if
[2:38:38] we looked at everything, there would be
[2:38:41] something.
[2:38:42] But let us be a mature
[2:38:45] group of people that are looking for the
[2:38:48] one, looking for the good. What can we
[2:38:52] do? How can I be part of the success of
[2:38:55] these meetings? How can I get into a
[2:38:58] channel that will unlock the secrets
[2:39:00] that someone has for years
[2:39:05] maybe in brokenness,
[2:39:10] maybe wounded heart and the Lord wants
[2:39:13] to just deal with that this weekend? Do
[2:39:16] you have time in your schedule for the
[2:39:18] Lord to do that and just say, "Lord,
[2:39:20] yes, Lord.
[2:39:22] Work on it, Lord. Work on us, Lord.
[2:39:26] And while you're at it, Lord, work on
[2:39:29] me. Work on my approach. Work on my
[2:39:34] spirit. I need help. I need leadership.
[2:39:39] You are my shepherd.
[2:39:42] Father, I pray forgiveness for every
[2:39:44] person that's wandered or went wayward
[2:39:47] somewhere. Change their heart. Change
[2:39:50] their mind. Give them a new heart. Give
[2:39:52] them a new spirit. Give them the Holy
[2:39:54] Spirit.
[2:39:55] Just baptize all of us, Lord. Wouldn't
[2:39:58] it be wonderful, Lord? What kind of
[2:40:00] meeting could we have this evening? You
[2:40:02] just come down and baptize all of us
[2:40:04] just freshly, a new just the love of
[2:40:06] God, just the that other dimension just
[2:40:09] hazy, just hazy with the glory of God
[2:40:12] and angels descending and ascending,
[2:40:15] coming down and ministering, casting out
[2:40:17] evil spirits
[2:40:19] even before the minister even gets here.
[2:40:22] that by the plane of those instruments,
[2:40:24] evil spirits could be cast out. That
[2:40:27] when the minister comes and begins to
[2:40:29] break the bread of life, it can come
[2:40:31] down to the heart, to our hearts. Lord,
[2:40:33] fill us, Lord. We pray for one another.
[2:40:37] Go after the one today. Go after the one
[2:40:40] person. Go after that teenager. Go after
[2:40:43] that sister. Lord, that brother, that
[2:40:45] man, that child. Our little babies,
[2:40:48] Lord, need you. Our elder ones need you.
[2:40:51] We all need you, Lord. I pray for the
[2:40:54] food that we will eat. I pray for the
[2:40:56] good health of every person that you
[2:40:59] would just cause all of us to prosper
[2:41:01] and be in good health. May there be no
[2:41:04] sickness and danger and harm come upon
[2:41:06] any of them. But may we be strong on
[2:41:09] Monday, Sunday, Monday when we go back
[2:41:11] home. Let our hearts burn within us that
[2:41:13] you had such love for us and would speak
[2:41:16] to us on such a level like this, Lord. I
[2:41:18] just want to praise your name, Lord. and
[2:41:21] give my all to you, Lord, in the
[2:41:23] presence of my brothers and sisters.
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; What better atmosphere could we be in
[2:41:28] but the presence of the Lord?
[2:41:31] Lead us, brother Isaac. Lead us as we
[2:41:33] turn the service and go to our afternoon
[2:41:36] in Jesus name.
[2:41:43] Let's sing this before we go with all
[2:41:45] our strength.
[2:41:46] I give myself [singing]
[2:41:48] [music] away,
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:41:54] I give myself [music and singing] away
[2:41:58] so you can use me. [music] I give myself
[2:42:04] [singing] away.

[2:42:15] can use [music and singing] me Lord here

[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; if anyone needs special prayer,
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; we're here for you. If you need a touch,
[2:42:31] if you need someone to put their faith
[2:42:33] with yours, [music]
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; that's what this weekend's all about
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; to [music] see
[2:42:40] [singing] your
[2:42:42] desire.

[2:46:02] everything you going through.

[2:46:16] in the shadow of your shame.
[2:46:23] But there's a light of hope that's
[2:46:26] shining.
