god bless you good to have you it's good to have know well you and Bernie home yeah god bless you praise the Lord amen amen let's just turn to the book of Colossians and chapter 2 and we'll read verses 12 sorry verses 11 down to verse 15 and then we're going to go to Hebrews chapter 2 as well so closures doing 11 to whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in Baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh and he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses like they were at all blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing triumphing over the aminute let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ Alleluia let's go to Hebrews chapter 2 and we're going to read verses 5 down to verse 11 I'm glad we serve the true Living God Hebrews 2 and 5 it says well I'm to the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come we're off we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what does man that thou art mindful of him or the Son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou Cronus him with glory and honour and did a set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet 4 and that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that has not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many so under glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren Amen metal-look bless his word you may have your seats this morning now I want to take a a bit of a thought this morning from Hebrews 2 and Hebrews 2 and 9 there but we see Jesus the Apostle Paul is here is writing to the Hebrews here he was writing it was more than an intellectual idea that he was putting forth it was more than just a new doctrine or a new teaching or a new religion but the Apostle Paul knew what he was talking about he was a man that would from his from from from being a young boy he studied the scriptures and he would he would spend a lot of hours no doubt memorizing them and writing them down and you know he he would have you know he became a Pharisee of the Pharisees he's a very devout man but there was but there was a part of his life where where he could not conquer and that part of his life was himself you know we understand that under the blood of bulls and goats no man could no man could be perfect in the sight of God the blood of bulls and goats could only cover sin it could not change the nature of man that we are born with you know we we know from from the book of Genesis where we're sittin cam into the world that that Satan allowed a hybrid nature of man to come into being these are a hybrid body you know this is a fallen body the spirit of man has fallen we're born and soon shaped at iniquity come to the world speaking lives and we should say hallelujah to that because if you recognize that then you know God has provided a way for you to be changed I mean it says in the Bible that there is not one man that seeketh after God not one because it's not in man's nature to actually look for him you're Amanda's man is constantly trying to further himself with maybe maybe a bigger house or maybe even owning a house or a better car or a better job or you know some kind of thing but that is not success in life you know success in life is not whether you have your own house or whether you have you know all the fancy you know all the natural things that is not how you win at the game of life you win at the game of life by meeting him I mean where Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life hallelujah that is that is the way to win don't get caught up in the in the hamster wheel of life you know comparing yourself with the Joneses and well I'm a certain age and and they're the same age as me and they've got their own they're virtually paid off their own house they've got a successful career you know they've got all these things and what do I have what happens their midlife crisis strikes then you start chasing those things who cares about those things hey you with me who cares about those things what legacy do you want to leave behind what legacy a big inheritance for your children or would you rather see Jesus Christ's birth than them I mean that should be the legacy that you should want to see for your family for your spouse is that if you were if this is the last day you had on earth that your legacy is Jesus Christ is living in them hallelujah that has eternal value be following me amen so don't worry about thee you know don't worry about anything else look to him the Apostle Paul he didn't all of us study and all of you know he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees all of us devoutness all of his ambition didn't come to anything when he stepped into the presence of the pillar of fire on the road to Damascus I mean with that where where where that light struck him down and he says who are you lord and that word Lord a supreme one Hawaii Supreme One amen he says I am Jesus whom you persecute it turned his whole life upside down Alleluia but for the Apostle Paul after that experience and going down into Arabia for three years and he would study the Old Testament and he would he would begin to find out that the god he met on the road to Damascus is the same God that Moses met the same God that Elijah met him in the same God that you know that covered Adam and Eve with with lambskins as they went out of the garden hallelujah that same God that spoke to he met him you've got to be real sure your experience matches God's Bible I mean that your experience member we are saved by faith in the Word of God I mean you can't just go by experience he'll remember God vindicates his word sure I mean he's a supernatural God we do not serve a God of tradition we do not serve a God of history I mean we are not historian saying all this is what Jesus did 2,000 years ago or even in the 60s or even 20 years ago I mean but he got to be alive today I mean but we see Jesus hallelujah he says he says I am the same yesterday today and forever and if that is the case and it is true it's in his word that means he's the same God that meant the Apostle Paul is present today and real Christianity is meeting him I mean to be a Christian is to be christ-like and you cannot be christ-like by trying to turn over a new leaf or a new year's resolution or finding some self-help book seven steps to becoming a successful Christian that's not how you become christ-like your will could not be number one of your life the Apostle Paul's world was was governing him here's a Pharisee of the Pharisees because his will was this is what I want to be this was his ambition but when he met God he had to cast away his own cast away his own ambition cast away his own will he says I can't everything but done that I would win Christ and that's what you've got to put your whole life your whole life everything you have doesn't matter of its material or family whatever you got to put that second place I mean you can't serve you can't serve God and something else at the same time a man at it because if he is God serve him with everything within him with your you're within you hallelujah that's what we should do I love singing the songs of Zion I love singing about Redemption I love singing about the blood cuz it's a reality hallelujah I trust it's a reality to you Amen glory to God he had to surrender as will a man and when he did that he says he says many times Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ amen and a prisoner there's no say and where they go they don't they don't call the warden up in the morning and say warden you know I don't feel like being in the cell I want to go out for a little bit you know breakfast wasn't very good last week you know I'm sick of this menu I'm going to change the menu I'm going to change what I dress you know I'm going to change the day core in this person I'm going to change the rules no that's not how it works the warden says you know the law which is behind the warden says this is your sentence this is we have to be I mean this is what you have to eat this is your schedule and you have no say hallelujah and it's the same thing with being a believer amen he gives us schedule a many you know he gives this is what you should this is how you should be this is how you should dress this how you should treat one another so you should treat your family amen and we understand it's not out of rules it's out of love hallelujah if you really love him it's a joy to be a Christian I mean it's a joy to serve the Lord hallelujah it's not a drudgery or a hardship or or help me lord it so thank you Lord even in the worst day thank you Lord hallelujah and I would rather love him than love this world what does does the devil have a heaven to give you the Hat does he have any turtle home to give you then why serve them I mean won't let him be your master I'm into some church give you a heaven are you with me you think all you going sideways know you don't serve a church you serve him I mean cause if you serve a church Church can't give you eternal life I mean some preacher can't give you eternal life it's God that has to give you eternal life and it's God that takes you to heaven hallelujah that's why you know the Apostle Paul it comes the very one that created heavens and earth who are you Lord hallelujah you know my heart's desire I just speak from my heart for a little bit you know there's a reason on Wednesday we're talking about the resurrection talk about Jesus going up Calvary talking about the disciples if they really understood what was going on that day that would have been the happiest people in all the earth hallelujah and the Spirit of God just dropped into place hey man you all know who's here hallelujah why is he dude why did he do that because he wants you to know I did that for you I mean I'm I'm here to prove to you it's more than a story I mean it's more than an idea it's more than a different way of life but he's trying to tell you I am the resurrection and the life I paid for your sins hallelujah I cook your send it away that day on Calvary hallelujah memory died for the sins of the world you're in that you're in the world are you proud of the world that means you purchase your salvation hallelujah to God glory to the land amen and then we think about how glorious it is on this day the lamb steps forth pablor he takes the book loosens the seals Amen steps down upon the earth what do you see when you see believers what do you see manifested I mean what's my title but we see Jesus where is Jesus and his people I mean Jesus in this church hallelujah says like the Apostle Paul this is this being speaks to him he says who al or I'm Jesus whom you persecute he didn't go chasing after a supernatural being he was he was after ordinary looking people who lived ordinary kind of lives I mean that weren't the who's who in life they just the common people hallelujah but Jesus was in them I mean God was veiled in their hallelujah hallelujah but we see Jesus and then you come among people what is this what is this I'll talk about these four walls who cares about the four walls God gave us the four walls but this isn't the Church where the people of the church I mean the people of the dwelling place of God hallelujah so what do you see when you see one another Paul would say in 1st Corinthians 11 that many are sick among you because you do not discern the Lord's body he's not talking about the bread and the wine those are just elements or symbols he's talking about the body is the body of Christ hallelujah when you see when you take each other by the hand she about looking someone's I see I see eternity and I see more than just a person I see eternity veils I see God bound in place hallelujah is that what you see but we see Jesus he had ambition amen but the Apostle Paul when he would when he would begin to write and he would tell us in Ephesians chapter 2 let's just go there because we read that he says not all things as we just turned to Ephesians 2 I'm just going to read from Hebrews 2 he says thou is put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him because we there's still death in the world physical death but the death that he abolished at the cross was spiritual death which is a far greater death than a natural death that's why the Apostle Paul went you know when the judgment came down behead him by the sword he's meat he be found guilty for insurrection all these things amen he went glory he went rejoicing he told he told Timothy before was coming he knew was coming I have a crown of life we'll read it later overcrowd of life waiting for me do you think of a man where he reading Corinthians we'll get it to Ephesians but you know when he would write and write in 1st or 2nd Corinthians he said about how I knew a man about 15 years ago is lifted up into the third heaven you know who he's talking about himself imagine a man have been taken up into the eternal it comes back down and then some other mortal says I'm gonna cut your head off do you think he would have been worried worried here's my ticket out of here I mean I've lived my right I've run my race I mean I I've delivered the full counsel of God to the people I have lived out my portion of the word and I'm done hallelujah aren't you gonna be glad one day I mean when the dead in Christ rise amen and God will cause us to recognize them what's he what's the what's a little gonna say to you basically and you're done I'm gonna take you home hallelujah glory to God I'm so glad we're living in that time of the resurrection allelujah asians two and one the Apostle Paul he this is not this is from experience and you had he quickened who once did in trespasses and sins we ran in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also ye all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us certain heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace you're saved through faith and that is not of yourselves as a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus and to good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them now we could keep reading because it's a glorious chapter but you know the Apostle Paul knew what it was like to do works he knew others like to be very devout around all the feasts times and to and to eat the right kind of things and keep the law with all of his energies and all of his ambition but then when the Lord quickened a member he was dead spiritually he was dead I mean and even in that condition even living there and you're sitting under Gamaliel the greatest Bible teacher of the age he was dead hallelujah but then one day Jesus came amen and so now he became alive his eyes of the eyes of his understanding became open amen he wasn't dead in trespasses and sins anymore but the Lord opened his eyes to what he was doing in his age amen and then he would begin to write that we were once we have been quickened by him I meant the believer is a totally different kind of person I mean to the people out on the street I mean not because they look at us and say why you dressed different in your a different kind of way I mean there's a life that comes into them I mean we have been quickened or made alive hallelujah is just like a seed you know you could have a couple of seeds they could look the same but they're both is no expression of life it has to be quick and it's going to be made alive I mean that when you take a seed and you plant it I mean everything that's in that seed comes to that's to come to life I lose just like an apple seed every Apple that will grow on that tree is already in that sea I mean it's just going to be planted I mean it's going to be watered it's going to be in the right kind of conditions hallelujah then the tree begins to grow I mean then all the apples that are in that one seed they come to life I mean that tree can raise up above the soil I mean begin to grow to its maker hallelujah begin to give it glory hallelujah nature praises God you know it's not ashamed it's not ashamed of praising God amen in our life you say well what about us how life should be a worship everything we do should be a worship I'm not talking about singing songs all day but everything we do should be a worship to God I mean how we treat our children how we treat our spouse how we treat people in the you know out on the street how we conduct ourselves why are you this way this is a worship a man because I've been redeemed hallelujah to God hallelujah that's how it should be everything we should do I mean when we get up in the morning thank you lord I have another 24 hours Amen to walk with you hallelujah brother Brown would say Amen he would say about I'll find it if I can find it here he says many times we see the unseen hand of God and we don't understand it's him now Lord we see Jesus we don't see all things we see we still take the saint sorry we we see we still take the Saints of us to the grave and walk over each other's grave but we see Jesus we made the promise we see him with us not Jesus in the grave not Jesus 2,000 years ago but Jesus tonight it's with us we see him manifested in all of his power and signs and wonders God may we never neglect this great salvation but may we embrace it and accept it and be reverent and live by it until the day that Jesus comes to take us home granted Lord we ask in his name hallelujah you know but many times in life we know we're just walking through life thank you that's the one thing I forgot this morning appreciate it you know we walk through life and we don't understand the protection that's around us I believe we were talking about this yesterday I mean yo we yo we take for granted we take for granted things that God keeps us from I mean when we just get up and we go about our daily life and you know things sometimes in the morning things can go wrong and maybe we're late for work or maybe the car just doesn't work and you know we we just can't get on the road like who want to and God's protecting us from from a crash someplace amen where you see you know you know there's many things that go on in life we just get up in the morning remember the devil he actually hates you he's not your friend he's not here to help you in any way he wants to destroy you he doesn't take prisoners to keep them prisoners he kicked he makes prisoners to execute prisoners amen and so we have to understand this world is more than what these five senses declare yes the unseen realm is far greater than what we see with these five senses I have been so now if that is the case then there is two powers battling there's a spirit of God and there's a spirit of Satan it's only two when you boil it down this only two and those two warring over you those two are fighting over you amen but we have to have great confidence where the Lord says I'll not lose one of them I'll not lose he cannot lose one of hers he says all the fire all that the father has given me will come and all that come to me will know why I'll no wise cast out I've been where the scripture would tell us at the angel the lord encamps about those who fear him and he delivers them hallelujah and so now if that is the case and I believe it's the case then when you get up in the morning even when you came here I'll say this it's more in this room than you can see I mean this far more in this room than you can see I mean because when the children of God begin to gather and worship amen the Angels that are said to protect them they come with holiness heaven has come into this room and then God is present among us hallelujah if we could only just just grasp the reality all that heaven and us has come down into this room hallelujah I am the resurrection and the life believe without this hallelujah this far more in this room than you can see well I'm just going along life I don't really see a whole bunch there's more in this room and see Alleluia the scripture would tell us of Elijah his servant there in there and Dathan or dothe or whatever it said and the Syrians come to go you know come get Elijah and they and they march they surround the city he's he's staying in and the servant gets up and he sees that the whole place is basically besieged and the servant gets worried what are we going to do Elisha wake up we're in trouble help us what's going to happen and then he just maybe just goes at listen Lord open is more for stand against us what are you worried about this Lord opened the man's eyes his eyes were 20/20 but as spiritual eyes were closed and what we really need is the spiritual eyes to come open Amen this is more than tradition this is more than what we do on a Sunday morning or maybe a Wednesday night I mean but it's a living reality hey with me this message our Lord Jesus Christ is real I said well I know that no but you got to really know that amen but we see Jesus that's my burden my burden recently is Lord everything you are I want to see I want you to be so real I mean you're the same God that was with the Prophet you're the same God of the day of Pentecost you're the same God that filled the temple in the Old Testament amen and you're the same God today and the glorious thing about today is his blood cleanses us that he can dwell in us hallelujah amen we should never be afraid to just lose control take control of the meeting Alleluia because that's what we need you need to let her Lord take my life and make it Thane I can't live this life in my own strength if you do you'll fail and you'll be discouraged many people try and I'm going to be a Christian I'm going to turn a new leaf I'm gonna walk with them and they fall flat and they wonder why they fall flat is because they have not given up they have not surrendered fully I mean you've got to actually you have to die that's it a few Sundays ago you've got to die you have been to die and be born again and that's not by it just saying is some sinner's prayer or just saying I'm gonna be a Christian now you've got to die your nature must die partly because of a Dyson he can come in I mean it makes a new creature in himself and if you are a new creature you say well I'm battling and look who's been quickened who's been quickened amen you're not dead anymore you'll be made alive in Jesus Christ howling you're a new creature in him amen that's a powerful thing you think now God has made us eat alive Holly and now he can operate through his body amen Satan better be careful Jesus Christ is here Amen not just in this room but wherever you are he says I'll never leave you I will never leave you nor forsake you who is that the very crater that made all things well says I'll never leave you so he says I'll go with you I'll go with you and to the world I'll go with you to school I'll go with you to your job site I'll go with you on the road I'll go with you to your house you say well I'm the only one no announced beliefs Mary was in the same kind of predicament hallelujah no one else had the visitation of Gabriel and she was just an ordinary young kind of girl I don't know what kind of age 16 maybe I don't know she's walking to a well one day just going about her business then she sees an angel this is more than a story there's more than a story friends and then and then this angel calls her by name Mary you're highly favored you're going to have the promise you're gonna have the seed of the woman hallelujah you got to bring forth the Messiah you're going to bring the holy water of Israel's going to be birthed out of you and then she says how can this be hallelujah the Holy Spirit will overshadow you you know we look at the word we look at promises they which are alive and remain should not hinder them which are asleep of the dead in Christ will rise first and which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air and we look at this to say how can it be so easy the Holy Spirit overshadow thee hallelujah you bring forth the promise of the day so she and then so she just is real simple let it be unto me according to thy word her faith accepted the promise I mean with many many young woman from the time that Isaiah gave the prophecy of virgin shall conceive eight hundred years about then - when Mary was here in the and and and the angel Gabriel visited her there to be many young woman I'm gonna be her and no doubt there would have been many dads I believe you're gonna be in because you're born in a right family you've been raised in the synagogue you do everything just right hallelujah hey those things are ok but you got to meet him I remember then 800 years later after Isaiah spoke those words a virgin shall conceive here she was she just accepted it let it be unto me according to thy word and we have to really we have to take that same kind of stand in all things many times we take the devil's word you know good enough you'll never make it it's not real it's just a motion you with me you can never be like that person in the church you can never overcome like that person hello you know you can never do it why do we accept it are you having a bad day just don't come you've had a bad week there's no way you should go to church why do we accept those things that's not that does not be unto me according to his word I didn't I made no promise with the devil amen my first birth bird me into a union with him I mean he was my master we just read there in Ephesians chapter 2 we walked according to the spirit of the world I mean the Prince of the power of the year but now we've been made alive but when I met him when I met the Lord Jesus that covenant was done away with I have no agreement with Satan I'm not here to negotiate with him I'm not here to put up with him I'm not here to be some peacekeeper and keep the peace amen Etta's it is give me victory or give me death I mean we should not settle to live below our privilege I mean why should we settle just to be dragged around and help me all now I'm going to make it I'm just going to scrape through we're not going to scrape through I mean by the blood of Jesus Christ we're going to walk out of here hallelujah and the devil will be happy to see you go I can't I tried to destroy these people I can't destroy these people I tried to put sickness on them and and get away with it you know try and robbed them of their faith I couldn't take their faith away I tried to discourage them amen - - to give it up they just couldn't give it up I mean I tried every possible way to tip them and they look this hit I don't care hallelujah they're so wonderful here comes the devil and his shiny things yeah do you want this do you want this it tries to give you shiny think you know the things of the world I mean here have a bigger job that you know that takes you away from God have a bigger house or some busyness of some hobby that robs you of the Spirit of God it's shiny things him yeah you know in front of you he tries to give you a kingdom I mean tries to give you a you know you know a Dominion aside Jesus he said that you know Satan came to Jesus he says well you bow down and worship me I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world but then you know it's the same thing with you Jesus he knew he was gonna take it over he just had to purchase it so he could have said to the devil I'm not trying to put words in his mouth but he could have said why would I want to run your your show you know it's the same thing up yo she'll be with you he tries to give you something you should look at it say I don't want to run what you've seen up hello I don't want to run what you'll see it up who cares no you'll see it up I've got a kingdom that's not of this world hallelujah and that kingdom is eternal amen and it's glorious and there's nothing bad about it hallelujah so whatever the devil tries to give you I trusted something in here it should never be help me Lord help me I don't want it but really you do it should just be nothing in here there's no deep calling to the deep with that desire go it died hallelujah it's been buried in the blood of Jesus Christ I don't know where he took it away Jesus took it away hallelujah amen that's what he does the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and he takes the nature away that we can overcome the food amen it's like a man who always gets into debt a rich man can come and pay the debt off but if the but if the nature of the man who falls into debt all the time is still there he will fall into debt again amen that's like justification but real transformation by his Holy Spirit is the spirit of the rich man goes into the one who falls into debt and if he has that same spirit he won't fall into dead anymore you following me that's what Jesus does hallelujah we we shouldn't just be in a cycle of you know victory and defeat victory and defeat you gotta look back in your life where were you're a year ago maybe I don't know how long ago look where you are today what's under your feet now there wasn't under your feet then who's who's more victorious who's more victorious today hallelujah that's the Lord putting things under your feet that's what he that's how he wants us to be amen we are victorious hallelujah to him that overcometh eces it's always a victory about them that overcoming every age to him that overcometh in this age you'll sit with me on my throne as I set out on my Father's throne hallelujah and he lets us do it he causes us to do it hallelujah glory to God now let's go to first Corinthians 15 so the Apostle Paul hallelujah he sees what it alive we be made alive we be received if you've received eternal life you have the greatest thing you can't buy it you can't earn it you can't work for it you can't bargain for it he gives it without manual price hallelujah you have the most precious thing hallelujah I mean actually sorry we're going to come back to there but I didn't mention it before but I want to actually go down to sorry I want to actually go to Luke 2ne1 first if you don't mind because I just want to deal with I know I did mention in the beginning don't get on the devil's hamster wheel mean but this what is so big what is so big in the day now we live in home improvement amen you know the block DIY and proving improving improving what is it it's it is comparing it is keeping up with the Joneses but it's been magnified like a million times amen and we don't want to get caught in that trap Luke 21 and that's read from verse 29 and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see and know that your own selves that summer is nigh is nigh at hand so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know you that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand vela i say to you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled now we understand the fig tree and prophecy is Israel if you go read Jeremiah chapter 24 Jeremiah speaks of figs as Israel and prophecy okay so since when you see the fig tree put forth which is Israel becoming a nation it says this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled so so the generation that sees Israel become a nation will not pass they'll be on the earth until all things be fulfilled right it's been 70 I don't know 70 years or I can't do math right now but however long it's been as well as being a nation a while and that and that generation is beginning to die off they're getting old oh we're at the end hallelujah right so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now he says listen he says take heed of yourselves lease at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life so that they come upon you unawares so he says when when this begins to happen beware take heed of yourselves that your hearts your you know your emotional state how you think does not become overcharged with the cares of life amen what has happened in this hour got to improve i got a you know people come to a certain age why do midlife crisis has come very simply because people begin to realize i've hits a forty or whatever it may be i'm running out of time and all of the dreams that they had of young they say oh those three i've always wanted to buy a big fancy car or whatever you know and they realize i've run out of time and i've and i haven't been able to live out that dream and satan begins to anoint their ambition satan begins to anoint the ambition of the person and they sacrifice they throw away their family they throw away their career or whatever it is that cuz you've got to give up something hello you've got to give up something you know you can't do you can't have it all just like jesus said you cannot serve God and Mammon you can't have it all you've got to get rid of one to have one hallelujah and I would very seriously this morning if you haven't you should look into what God has for you and weigh it up we don't even need to weigh it up because what is what a Satan here for you nothing Elisha says take care that the kids of this life some people they begin to see yo there's such a big thing in the country it's been for a couple of years you got to have your own home you must get into the property market you've got to get in such a pressure and sure it's good to get into the property market it'd be if if you want to buy a house buy a house you know if you own one good for you if you're renting be content you know whatever state you're in you got to be continued content with godliness is great gain the Apostle Paul says Amen so people get caught up in this whole Oh and then they'll and they'll throw away everything to move someplace and buy a house although you know and then they get all you and then people that's why there's so much you midlife crisis divorces and so on because people get so anointed by the enemy and their ambition goes one way amen for as a snare verse 35 it shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth that's you do you live here amen you know the Martian you live in this earth that means this will try and be a snare to you amen but we should not be caught up as I said we should not be caught up in the kids of this life sure Jesus could come right now afraid us because every we we really have every promise for the Gentiles as done I'm in the you know the Jews have gone back to the homeland they are promised three-and-a-half years where the Messiah will come the same God we know will reveal himself to them hallelujah I mean they will receive the same redemption that you know that we have i mean but before he turns to them we're going up will be the wedding supper in the sky hallelujah so you know Russia's taking her place America is taking her place I'm in the whole world you're the Wills of prophecy of turning sure hallelujah everything the Lord is just every everything he says in Revelations he says he puts in the heart of them to do his will a means of the vatican's doing his will Russia's doing as well America's doing this will every nation under heaven is doing us will where they want to acknowledge it or not God's in control God isn't panicking in heaven or what's going to happen what's going to him what's going to happen he's just watching the wheels was prophecy turned slow and sure Alleluia remember and this time he's gathering as he licked at once hallelujah that's why such a glorious time that's why Redemption is so glorious to me mm where he where he now he purchased his bride at Calvary now he comes to claim as bride that means that's why he stepped forth out of history to you hallelujah and he makes himself known to you because it says you are my precious possession and when I practice your Calvary now I'm going to clean you holy in order to claim you I'm going to strip the devil off of you I mean that you would know that you don't beloved to him I mean you never came from him hallelujah I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ hello that's why we can pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name and then you come out of your father I mean your birthday yeah your life came out of him hallelujah to God isn't that right and it's what a Christian is a Christian is made in His image Alleluia hey man I do not belong to Satan I do not belong to this world they have no part I have no part of them they have no part of me I mean there's no agreement between me and them hallelujah I trust is the same with you I'm bought with a price and that is the blood of Jesus Christ I am NOT my own the Bible says hallelujah maybe this is not like some divorce agreement where you can have them the weekend you can have them the week this is not how it works Jesus says they're mine give them up Satan by the blood of Jesus Christ and he enforces his victory hallelujah God amen amen his blood he says he says that that first husband has done away with I mean that's why says the Apostle Paul says in the book of Romans yo one cannot be married to another while there are other spouse loose and he's speaking of a greater marriage and of all of the spiritual union of the Bride of Christ police say the person could not be united with Christ and be united with with the world holy that's why the Lord bear he he just comes in he may be a gentleman but he will not let us he you know there comes a time where he says Satan you're done you're done with this person you're done with them in their life let's come to an end I'm going to read their mind they're not going any further hallelujah just like Jonah he wanted to go to Tarshish say God put a stop to his his boat ride hallelujah you can't go any further you know heat your heat yo you sleep in the cabin I'm gonna everything's gonna be fine because it's human nature didn't want to go we know God's telling a bigger picture but it's like you God begins the deal child of mine won't you come you get on a boat to Tarshish sometimes you sleep Oh finally I've escaped their presence but the Bible says that goodness and mercy will follow us all the days of our life and that word follow actually means to pursue and overcome hallelujah so you've got to understand that goodness and mercy of God was chasing you amen and it overcame you hallelujah and you had to surrender to it hallelujah and you're going to have you have confidence now that those who are lost and undone in the world I mean family whoever it may be say God send your goodness and mercy chase them I mean overcome they're going to come home I mean they're going to come home hallelujah that's what God draws my goodness as mercy you can outrun God you must just give up just quit just quit you do yourself a world of good hallelujah don't die tired just died hallelujah it's like a fish on the end of a line yes and the line cannot break hello Lou yeah they don't run minam run is it gonna run a line I can't ran out of line it's eternal okay and slowly and slowly he's gonna give up why do all that running wouldn't you rather be on this table hello Lydia wouldn't you rather be a fish on his table Jesus said the kingdom of God is like a net that's cast out and it's pulled in a mint there's some there's some turtles and snakes and whatever more but is the fishies looking for Alleluia would you wouldn't you rather be a prize fish on this table Alleluia I'm so glad the day I gave up glory to God now we're in first Corinthians 15 let's go amen now I love I love it held the Bible there's a generation where the promise is given but then there's a generation with the promises fulfilled and it's like Abraham would be promised in in the book of Genesis he said your seed will sojourn in a strange land for hundred years but after that time I will deliver them with a mighty hand and they'll come back to the you know to the promised land so the promise was given to Abraham but the fulfillment was in future generations and like many things the Apostle Paul would write win because we must understand when he wrote the promise of the rapture of he said we which are alive and remain so when I believed when he was inspired to write first Thessalonians 4 and 5 he went when he would write we he believed he was part of that group I mean that they did in Christ who already did but he was the alive in the rain but he didn't understand would be 2000 years I mean the promise was being given through the first church aid messenger but there were people that would fulfill they're alive and remain part hello you how you doing today hallelujah I trust you can see you know because we are living time where all scripture must be fulfilled Amen that they that the word that's been sitting there maybe even thousands of years it must become manifested in a people alleluiah we understand that there's some scriptures we will never fulfill I mean the bride will be never thrown into a lake of fire I mean she will not go through a tribulation hallelujah Amen we will not be burnt with the great horn here on the church systems that's not our fulfillment but our fulfillment is that she would be arrayed in fine linen clean and white and that's you right now that is the believer right now amen we are as he became sin that we would become the very righteousness of God through Christ Alleluia some you know there's some promises where the ephesian church if you read Ephesians chapter 4 you know the you know the Apostle Paul would place them yeah these are spiritual people but he comes to Ephesians chapter 4 and he says until we all grown to the fullness of the statue of Christ and to the perfect man so they were looking at becoming they had been birthed into the kingdom they're growing but they had to grow to become a fully mature Church now we understand that if you look at history they aimed at that but they relaxed and that slowly went down then it went into the dark ages amen you read you read Acts chapter 15 there's already Pharisees there's already people who had come in among the believers that profess to be believers but they're still Pharisees they're still believing part of what they used to believe it's what had happening there was a full everyone was birthing the kingdom and you know and on the day of Pentecost there begin to drift even in amen now we are not ordained for that we are ordained to press onto the high calling in Christ and actually become a fully mature body amen so what so what Paul was writing the book of Ephesians it would become embodied in the people remember the word must put on flesh it has to put on flesh it's not it's got to be more than just quoted or put on your Instagram or Facebook or on your fridge but it has to become embodied the word must dwell in you and manifest now first Corinthians 15 now as I said he was looking at this and he believed that he is part of this he says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed we shall be transformed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet of God shall sound as did in Christ shall race incorruptible and we shall be changed he's putting himself in there we shall be changed for this incorruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality now this is a promise and it's been sitting there okay so when this corruptible must put on incorruption then this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory hallelujah so now we're looking we're living in these moments where we are living in the scripture if this is a map I would say you're here amen we've come there is a people that are lifted off the earth before the Great Tribulation they there is a way of escape in this hour I mean there is an ark like in the days of Noah but the Ark is not a physical boat in this day it is Christ and Christ is his word Alleluia say well how do you get into the sack repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children amen hold on to that promise all of us with children amen you and your children those that are afar off and when I'm in Papua New Guinea I say even in Papua New Guinea and it's minutes the Lord our God shall call now that's the first that's the first sermon preached all day of Pentecost Acts chapter 2 did Peter get it wrong no when Jesus said the name baptize in the name one name Father Son Holy Ghost Peter gave the name Lord Jesus Christ Alleluia that's Haigh into the ark now get the swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God who give us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen that's why we should be steadfast we are not following currently devised fables of men I mean we are not following something that's been hatched up in a seminary or an or in some Bible school or even in Jeffersonville or someplace Amen but we are following the vindicated Word of God we are following the proven Word of God hallelujah have we not Amen was the testimony it's evidence that this is a life I mean like a testimony in court you give a testimony I was there I saw this amen and we can stand and say I can give testimony that this is truth as promises of truth and it does transform me Alleluia and it has brought me this far it's going to take me to heaven I mean because my faith is not in not in something other than the written word of God because if you have genuine faith in this word it will manifest and prove it in your life glory to God amen and that's why we can rejoice this message that we've embraced reveals Jesus Christ in this Bible I admit it's not another testimony of Jesus Christ and as the testimony of Jesus Christ Alleluia so that's why we should be steadfast our labor is not in vain amen so how we raise up remember our whole energies our whole energies should be number one honey spouse honey husband whatever we're gonna serve the Lord we're going in a rapture the Lord has promised us an eternal home amen an eternal home and he's given us the ability to get there I mean before he puts it me but God doesn't enforce something upon a people without giving them first away to do it hallelujah Amen just like in the Old Testament kill the slam this shed blood I want to have fellowship with you he didn't leave them to work it out he says this is how you do it I've given you a prophet that gave you the word I gave you a priesthood that they can stand between you and you and me I gave you a sacrifice that covers your sin amen and then when Jesus stood and said be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect now it's not like wool how we're gonna do it let's have a committee meeting let's work out how we can be perfect that's not how it worked out he makes you perfect by his offering by his blood by one offering he's perfected for you and then them that are sanctified hallelujah amen hey we're maturing we're growing so this there's perfection as in sinless perfection and his perfection as in mature as long as we're growing make me grow lord give me vitamins give me food give me spread your food I want to grow Alleluia amen so know we so that should be our whole goal family we're going Jesus stop the cross to take us to heaven and we love Him that's why we serve Him because we love him not because of any other thing why do we do this daddy we love him he's so good to us hallelujah took our sin our way revealed himself to us we weren't looking for him doesn't matter if you're religious up to your eyeballs he's gotta beat you Alleluia why is it you know that should be oh that's why we should be steadfast this remember you create an atmosphere in your home you gonna be the only one like Mary I'll pick that up but she believed she believed the angels message no one no one was rejoicing with her all of Nazareth didn't erupt saying glory the Messiah is coming I mean they weren't rejoicing even Joseph that loved her in a sad Center I'm just gonna have to put her away privately he didn't understand what was going on until the same angel meet him in a dream but she believed she believed hallelujah and she didn't have a whole church backing her up she didn't have a leader like she didn't have she didn't have preachers screaming at her you're gonna have the Messiah you're gonna bring him to the earth through your worm he's going to be made flesh I mean he didn't have his favorite prick her favorite preacher screaming or favorite singing or whatever she had a word from God hallelujah we say many people say I heard from God is it inhere Amen because many people say well you know you see it on the news sometimes God told me to kill this person hold on hold the phone was that God no wasn't God well well how can you tell it was very supernatural you know there's a being came into the room and incredible things happened well is it in here is it in here that's why you should always sit back sit back and say well I need to find it in here from Genesis to Revelation not just an isolated scripture amen and so we should be steadfast unmovable amen we are not here we are not part of this world's economy right we are not subject to this economy we are subject to God's economy a man if you put your whole life in his hand he will take care of you he will feed you he will clothe you he will give you a house he'll give you a job if you don't have a job he will direct your steps amen if things will just move and you won't understand I mean I've heard many many testimonies of you know you know brethren who have say gone to the States or America from you know from Africa and they just get residency whatever like like through the through the official way but somehow their file just gets pulled out they get stamped there you know and they're allowed to stay in the country and people people say that just shouldn't happen what's happened God made it happen God made it happen and if he can do that for people can he look after you can T guide your steps Alleluia we should see Jesus and everything amen we should be steadfast the way we live the God we serve it's not in vain it is not in vain I guarantee hundred percent this is not a vain walk I mean do not be weary in well-doing do not be wearing well doing just keep pressing the battle Alleluia death shall be swallowed up in victory now let's go to Isaiah 25 and read from where the Apostle Paul was from was reading from I like this as well I wanted to read it I say at 25 and we read from verse 5 down to verse 9 thou shall bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make and to all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lease effect things full of marrow of wines on the Leeds well refined and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all the people the veil that is spread over all nations now Moses this is just me this is just in fellowship as brother Johnny DeMuth would say there's a veil put over the juice when they read the law because they are ordained they were they wrote they were blinded that the Gentiles could come and amen and but all the true Jews from Calvary to now will be there cuz cuz God blinded them but there is a very spiritual veil over the whole world amen there's a veil of tradition a min is a veil of unbelief but he says that them on this mountain I believe this is mountains I mean this just mean Fellowship's you can take it or leave it whatever you want to do right see see say the people on this mountain Mount Zion that's where we've come to yeah we don't have time to read Hebrews chapter 12 but Paul says the Apostle Paul's you have not come to Mount Sinai where you know you know we'd God gave the law and no one could could approach even you know come on the mountain they said be thrust through with a dart God came down there's a separation between the people and God he says you have not come unto that mountain but you've come unto the Mount Zion I'm into two and an innumerable company of angels that's why I said there's so much more in here hallelujah we've come to this place I mean where spiritual realm was opened up hallelujah they seize to the spirits of just men made perfect amen isn't it glad hey this body's going to be redeemed but the spirits have just been made perfect that's you hallelujah and answer Jesus I'm just quoting the you know just go read Hebrews I believe it is 12 I mean the media the the mediator of the new covenant so he says now the people on this mountain I'll destroy and I'll destroy in this mount in the face the covering cast over all the people the veil that has spread over all nations now there's been a traditional veil the devil what he tries to do as he gives false doctrine to the people I mean that the people will not believe the truth and it takes the life away it takes eternal life at vales eternal life from the people right jesus said by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men you make the Word of God no effect and what was the what was the word what was the law men to do I'm gonna cover your sins by the blood of bulls and goats until the Redeemer comes and wipes all the dead away I mean that was the purpose of the look they said by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men you make the Word of God no effect and so there's a traditional veil but in this day that veil has been renting to Alleluia that we are not looking at this Bible and saying what does it mean hello we should say hallelujah I mean we're not looking and saying I don't know if it is he 3:5 18 how many gods are there is one manifested in three different offices Alleluia how do we baptize it's clear I mean how were you know all the mysteries of the Bible have come open what does God like was he doesn't like it's been has been manifested let's become Rick right so that veil we see God as he really is Allu you it means that the veils been taken out okay the the veil that has spread over all the nations he will swallow up death and victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from all the earth for the Lord has spoken it and it shall be said in that day lo this is our God we have waited for him and he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation Alleluia so this is where the Apostle Paul would take the scripture death has swallowed up in victory the veils been taken away amen we know who the Lord is this is not out of an arrogant weight God has revealed himself to us and not just here but around the world there's people almost everywhere Alleluia where there where where the Apostle Paul would go and meet Peter after a thing about 15 years after the road to Damascus experience and they sat down and they begin to talk they hadn't met each other until now they found out that preaching the same thing I mean because the same God that met had met both of them hallelujah amen so they knew exactly that took well this shall be swallowed up in victory we are living in the time of the change of the body amen we are a people in order to be physically resurrected right we have to be spiritually resurrected first and to be resurrected us to be made alive I mean to be quickened I mean so there has to be a people I believe I'm looking at them today amen that have become spiritually alive in Jesus Christ I mean that they have been resurrected hallelujah and that is the proof that this is reality this is the proof that this message is reality amen because he said I am the resurrection and the life I mean so where he is he is the resurrection and the life hallelujah where where when he went to Lazarus tomb that day you know we said to me real Martha I am the resurrection and the life if he didn't call Lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection right there and then Alleluia so now if he is the resurrection in the life where he is death cannot stay amen every time he went past a funeral you reading the Gospels the person didn't stay did Amen hallelujah he raised him from the dead now his spirit is still among us quickening his word to make people life hello amen we have been resurrected and brother Bram says the sign of the resurrection in the end time is a people that have been resurrected I mean the believer becomes the site of the resurrection amen because the things they once were they did too and they are now alive in Christ and men to the things that were once under bondage true whether it was was drugs or smokey or the world or popularity or whatever it was I mean that thing is dead hallelujah a new creature you become a new creature in Christ I mean this message is transforming power hallelujah that's why that's why I'm this you know you know that's why in this age we have brother bear him here and he would and the Lord would open the word to show us this is Jesus in his word amen it's not houki spooks amen he it shows Jesus Christ in here and it said now that same life that was back there it's now present the angel of the Lord that was there in the prophets ministry it's still alive today amen the same God it's not a different God it's not a different one it's not a different God to the one in the Bible you say you've gone off now they said Jesus went off at the end amen just using modern modern terminology oh he went off he was doing real good being a prophet of Nazareth and raising the dead healing the sick but then he began to claim by Messiah that's the that's the reason he came into the world I went off with E and he got crucified amen because he were getting to declare I am he and then now you have a little man stand here in this generation and he began to show Jesus Christ in his word and they said well he was good when he healed the sick and discerned the sort you know thoughts and tends to the heart but then when he began to show what the truth of the Bible was now he's got off at the end no hasn't gone off at the end I don't know why I'm going down this way but here we are but it's the that was the resurrection I mean there's been a quickening come hello you say I have experienced their quickening I mean I am NOT the person I once was I have not just become religious I have not just joined a church amen but the same God we're gonna go back to the Apostle Paul now there's same God that met the Apostle Paul has met me hallelujah and so now you become the sign of the resurrection to the earth amen the believer he said well that's all very kind of underwhelming no it's not you look at no you gotta look at spiritually what the believer is we are not just mentally I'm a new creature you actually resurrected you're not dead in trespasses and sins anymore amen this is what because ultimately people talk about Calvary but we should actually wanted Calvary produce I mean what does Calvary produce because if Calvary happened and I know it happened then it would produce a people that are now alive in Christ I mean they've been delivered from dead works of the flesh and of man I mean they no longer have a sin nature which just cause them to live in the world I remember they've been resurrected above those things hallelujah that's what Calvary what is the blood Dome what does it mean I'm now washed by the blood Oh what what you once were you not anymore I mean you say this is very elementary no there is a power in the word is a pair on the word to overcome all temptation there's a power in the words to overcome all sin and I'm going to finish with this thought there's a power Amen in the world to overcome every devil amen you can understand Satan is not your master his works are not meant to be your master amen you do not have to you know the devil lies to people you see young people they sit in church and they play survivor Church if I can just outlast this the devil says wait a bit longer wait a bit longer you don't have to listen you don't have to give you a life you don't have to give yourself and that's the line to them and then they grow up and they come to about 40 and the devil lights them again are you've got to relive your dream you were going to do this you were to do this and they have a midlife crisis what is it the devil's been lying the whole time what happens people were born the devil begins to lie to them when they come to the age of accountability you don't have to give you a life you can just float along you can just hide in church your camouflage no one sees you God sees you you can't hide from him and then and then the devil says just wait a little bit longer than I say I'll wait a bit longer and then they come to about teenage years the world opens up to them and bushing comes in you can be anything you want you can but there's one thing I want to be I want to be an eternity hallelujah I want to be found in his righteousness amen and that people continue on in the devil lies lies lies lies lies and off they go well who did they listen to this the service has gone a very different way but here we are just don't listen to the devil's life he says just wait a little bit longer you don't really have to surrender everything he will give you the devil will give you a good family he will give you a good church he'll give you good ministry and good music he will he will offer the world to you but without a real birth amen he will give you all those things and that is that is living below your privilege remember Satan is meant to be under your feet he is not he will always come in the veil of religion ultimately and him say just serve this the Apostle Paul he was actually serving all said it may be very strong but the scribes and Pharisees they crucified our Lord Jesus who was anointed named Satan Satan anointed them did they crucify the Prince of life so the Apostle Paul was actually serving Satan in that system I mean where the allegro he was serving sated in that system he had to become quick and he had to become a life the devil was going to give him a kingdom you can be the Bible teacher of Bible teachers because the devil took his ambition was going to take him there I mean but God wants to take your ambition and take you to heaven hallelujah it's your choice what do you want don't just be religious people can receive a religious spirit that's the hardest one to break because people justify themselves but I'm religious I do this I can quote this I can do this I mean they could be living like the devil I mean that's living below your privilege amen oh this is a bit strong no Christ came to deliver us amen that he we become love prisoners to him I mean but we see Jesus hallelujah Jesus came to set the captives free only can we have some musicians to come don't live below your privilege they're children of Israel we're living as slaves they had a choice they could run back when the pressure came on they were used to being slaves in Egypt their daddies were slaves their granddaddy's were slaves but then they got taken out of slavery one day an angel came spoke to a man in a burning bush go down and set my people free they weren't slaves in the eyes of God Satan saw the most slaves they got lifted up out of slavery then now pressure came on let's go back to Egypt let's go back there they forgot that the Egyptians were wanted to kill killed all of the boys why the Moses end up and end up in a basket gonna wipe out this race you with me gonna wipe out this race I think so they wanted to go back to that they wanted to go back to that because of a slave mentality that was below their privilege they could have been they could have talked to each other and said we've never been free before and the devil would have come to them and said you've always been slaves you got a slave nature get a slave mentality and he anointed them let's go back to slavery that's not what God had for them amen that's the same thing with us we're not called because people I know you said you know people sit in church and the devil comes to them you've never been free you've never been victorious you think you can overcome this you think you think God can save your family hasn't happened yet it's not gonna happen now hello who's been there and sometimes we've begun to agree because you haven't seen it happen well who are you listening to Joshua and Caleb said let's go take the land I mean we're more than able he's made us able hallelujah well I don't know if it can be done by the authority God's Word it can be done hallelujah don't be weary and don't be discouraged throw your duck doubt your doubts I mean because the devil knows if he could just lit your if God breaks his grip if God can break the Satan's grip off your life he doesn't know what to do with you brother Bram said a man can so be surrender to God that the devil don't even know what to do with us hallelujah and that's got to become flesh and people I mean so don't don't look at your past Jesus took care of your past I've never seen it happen I tell you these many things he's becoming you sorry but yeah Maggie's down but you know you become a new believer you begin to read promises of the word I've never seen that happen it's like healing supernatural healing before it happens to you say I've never seen that happen before I've never seen someone ask me fill with the Holy Ghost because when you become a new believer then God says I'll show you a menu just taken me this word you say Lord I want to see this happen he says I will show you Alleluia don't be discouraged don't be up and down well I don't feel it brother Brown no Jesus I'll say brother brems said it too but jesus said he didn't say do you feel it when people came to be healed he never said do you feel it are you happy now they said hey do you feel like you're gonna take a rapturous know do you believe it and we have to throw away sometimes we're going to throw away how we feel you say well how do you feel when you pray to God prayed for I felt you know don't go by the feeling because it always be this will how it'll be is like this yeah you know the devil anoints yo comes you and says you got to feel like you're on some plane and once you get to that plane of greatness then you got then the Lord will answer your prayers and it's always too high you can never obtain it and you just get this boy because he's dangling a carrot that doesn't exist just like any promise in the Bible he's dead because it dangled it and you can never catch it and he just moves it as you jump low because but you start running down that way and you get discouraged but it's faith in the word brings the promise not how you feel it's faith in the word Amen Jesus came Amen to give his faith in you so it's not how you feel that's why the Word of God separates between the spirit and the soul I mean to take away the spirit yo sure this feeling if you say you love someone don't feel it it's not real love Amen but faith is more than a feeling so don't go by feelings necessarily I've prayed for things felt dear as a post and I've seen it happen because God wants to show you it's not how you feel it's do you believe it and there's more than a feeling but I believe in a heartfelt religion Alleluia I mean less dead shall we you love the Lord this morning hallelujah amen I wanna I wanna sing
