[54:15] amen
[54:18] i believe anything could happen just now
[54:21] anything could happen
[54:23] hallelujah
[54:25] hallelujah
[54:28] amen
[54:30] luke 22 and verse 14
[54:34] and then we'll go to second samuel and i
[54:36] trust us all ties together i believe it
[54:38] will
[54:40] eventually
[54:41] luke 22 and 14
[54:44] and when the hour
[54:46] was come and he sat down and the 12
[54:48] apostles with him
[54:50] and he said unto them with desire i have
[54:52] desired to eat this passover with you
[54:55] before i suffer
[54:57] for i say unto you i will not anymore
[54:59] eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[55:01] kingdom of god.
[55:02] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[55:04] said take this and divide it among
[55:07] yourselves for i say unto you i will not
[55:09] drink of the fruit of the vine until the
[55:11] kingdom of god shall come
[55:13] and he took bread and gave thanks and
[55:15] break it and gave unto them saying this
[55:17] is my body which is given for you this
[55:19] do in remembrance of me likewise also
[55:21] the cup after supper saying this cup is
[55:24] the new testament in my blood which is
[55:26] shed for you but behold
[55:29] the hand of him that betrayeth me is
[55:30] with me on the table and truly the son
[55:33] of man goeth as it was determined but
[55:36] woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed
[55:39] and they began to inquire among
[55:41] themselves which of them it was that
[55:44] should do this thing
[55:46] and there is the last verse i'd like to
[55:48] read here and there was also a strife
[55:51] among them
[55:52] which of them should be accounted
[55:55] the greatest
[55:57] maybe we'll just leave it there
[55:59] may the lord bless the reading of his
[56:00] word you may have your seats
[56:02] this morning
[56:04] i'd like to um
[56:06] i'd like to speak about the main thing
[56:10] father donny reagan preached the message
[56:12] uh i can't remember what it was called
[56:13] it evening like tabernacle and he opened
[56:15] with this quote he said
[56:17] i want to speak to you something to
[56:19] bring something to enlighten you the
[56:20] promise of god for this age see
[56:22] something not something that somebody
[56:24] else was in some other day but something
[56:27] and when them things are all right we
[56:29] all refer to those things but i thought
[56:31] i would try to bring something to your
[56:33] mind with these scriptures i got written
[56:35] here that would enlighten you to know to
[56:37] make you a better soldier in the field
[56:39] that you're fighting in now
[56:41] to learn the tactics of the enemy so
[56:43] that you can block everything before it
[56:45] gets to you see
[56:47] that's the main thing
[56:49] is to learn to keep the punches off of
[56:51] you as much as you can
[56:53] now he said that
[56:55] you know you should go and study the
[56:57] phrase the main thing so i'm not here to
[56:58] repeat his sermon but i so i went away
[57:01] and studied where brother says the main
[57:03] thing
[57:04] and he and he refers to that that he
[57:06] says the main thing all the way through
[57:08] his message so we want to see what the
[57:10] main thing is
[57:12] you know it's very interesting where if
[57:14] we could just go back there to the to
[57:16] the time of the passover whether there's
[57:18] the you know jesus you know if we could
[57:20] just be transported back two thousand
[57:22] years ago would be gathered around the
[57:23] supper table there you know i doubt very
[57:26] much that jesus would have had a very
[57:27] light-hearted look on his face maybe
[57:29] jovial kind of counters he would have
[57:31] been very serious because he knew what
[57:33] he was about to face he knew that he was
[57:35] going to carry the sin of the world upon
[57:37] his shoulders he was going to redeem
[57:38] mankind and you know he knew this was
[57:40] going to be the last passover and you
[57:42] know he you know he would even say to
[57:44] the say to the um
[57:47] i'll just drop this in now it's very
[57:48] easy to miss the main thing
[57:50] by things of life going on humanity and
[57:53] trouble and you know so we don't want to
[57:55] miss the main thing so here jesus was he
[57:58] says in luke 15 he says with desire
[58:00] desire to eat this passover with you
[58:02] before i suffer so he's telling the
[58:04] disciples i'm about to suffer
[58:06] and then he and then he goes down he
[58:08] says my body will be given and all those
[58:10] things but then
[58:11] uh then he says about the man who is is
[58:14] going to betray me is with you he's one
[58:16] of you then they begin to acquire about
[58:19] who that would be but then there was
[58:21] also strife among them about who would
[58:23] be counted the greatest now can we can
[58:26] we just put ourselves in those shoes to
[58:28] me this blows my mind
[58:30] here is the here is the lamb of god he's
[58:33] about to be offered for the sins of the
[58:34] world and not just not just for the sins
[58:36] of the world but for those disciples
[58:38] sins who are sitting with them and not
[58:40] just for them but for you and i and and
[58:43] and he's beginning to tell them i'm
[58:45] gonna suffer we're gonna have this meal
[58:47] and then basically after this point my
[58:49] life is going to be suffering till it's
[58:51] going to be finished and you know even
[58:53] says that you know one of you is going
[58:55] to betray me and maybe they begin you
[58:56] know they begin to inquire among
[58:58] themselves i doubt anyone would have put
[59:00] their hand up for that job
[59:02] do you think it's you judas no i don't
[59:03] think it's me do you know you know they
[59:05] begin to acquire but then there was a
[59:06] strife
[59:07] among themselves who would be the
[59:09] greatest
[59:10] so here they are caught up in their
[59:12] humanity
[59:13] and who's going to be the greatest and
[59:15] because this thing's going to grow
[59:17] it's not going to stay just
[59:20] you know us 4 no more or the m12 and no
[59:22] more it was going to expand
[59:24] and the problem is when people get
[59:26] caught up in the humanity of the
[59:28] situation they miss completely what god
[59:30] is doing they miss the main thing
[59:32] now you know that there is a group of
[59:34] people naturally in a group of people
[59:37] people naturally begin to think about
[59:39] who's going to be the greatest
[59:40] then they begin to rank themselves upon
[59:43] personality charisma stature
[59:47] and then they begin to think about their
[59:49] roles in the group because they would
[59:51] have seen how jesus conducted his
[59:52] meetings here brother brown he
[59:53] dramatizes when simon the pharisee he
[59:56] sends his courier to jesus to invite him
[59:58] to the feast and you know that courier
[1:00:00] gets finally gets to where the crowd is
[1:00:02] then he gets to the outer circle of the
[1:00:04] disciples maybe andrew or bartholomew or
[1:00:06] one of them and then you know you know
[1:00:08] he gets to them and then he gets to the
[1:00:10] inner circle of peter james and john
[1:00:11] then finally he gets to the master so so
[1:00:14] they would have been watching how jesus
[1:00:15] conducts meetings and then maybe you
[1:00:17] know one of the disciples would be
[1:00:19] sitting there saying well you know
[1:00:20] surely peter peter will be the he'll be
[1:00:22] the usher or he'll be the deacon because
[1:00:24] he's a big burly fisherman he's rugged
[1:00:26] and you know he's really got a
[1:00:28] commanding kind of presence he'll keep
[1:00:29] the people back and you know maybe maybe
[1:00:32] you know matthew you know he was a tax
[1:00:34] collector but you know he's really
[1:00:35] changed you know he's really honest now
[1:00:37] and you know you know this thing's going
[1:00:38] to grow and you know judas is going to
[1:00:40] need more help with the with the
[1:00:41] finances i'm going with something with
[1:00:43] this you know so yeah but we got to put
[1:00:44] ourselves in you know you know so judas
[1:00:47] is going to need help with the finances
[1:00:48] so you know but you know god can use
[1:00:50] things from your previous life and bring
[1:00:51] it into now and you know yeah but what's
[1:00:54] happening is people are putting people
[1:00:55] in orders and different jobs and you
[1:00:57] know and you know the sons of thunder
[1:00:59] the sons of zebedee why they really live
[1:01:01] up to their name they're going to be the
[1:01:03] evangelist they're going to go shake the
[1:01:04] world you know they're going to go out
[1:01:06] and do that maybe andrew well he's a
[1:01:08] quiet kind of guy he'll just be the
[1:01:09] prayer warrior and you know you know you
[1:01:11] know and you know thaddeus and thomas
[1:01:13] and bartholomew you know they seem to be
[1:01:15] kind of clicky in their own thing so i
[1:01:17] don't seem to fit in with them so well
[1:01:18] so they're probably going to go off and
[1:01:20] start at work somewhere else and because
[1:01:21] they're a different part of the church
[1:01:23] they just get along together and what's
[1:01:24] happening is it's carnal you know
[1:01:27] placing gifts and and i and i can
[1:01:29] guarantee you one thing if we sat there
[1:01:31] at the table and guessed who would be
[1:01:33] what would be all wrong
[1:01:35] hallelujah would be all wrong and that's
[1:01:37] what happens is man thinks well this is
[1:01:38] what this person should be doing if
[1:01:39] brother so-and-so did this and sister
[1:01:41] so-and-so and they're all wrong god just
[1:01:43] takes people and it seems like they're
[1:01:45] just the wrong people for the job but
[1:01:47] you find out they're the right people
[1:01:48] for the job and god uses those people
[1:01:50] for his kingdom hallelujah but the thing
[1:01:52] is all of that running through their
[1:01:54] minds they were missing the main thing
[1:01:57] the greatest week they were living in
[1:01:59] the midst of the greatest week in
[1:02:00] history the prophet says the death bear
[1:02:02] resurrection of our lord jesus christ
[1:02:04] here was a great redeemer that was
[1:02:06] prophesied from from from from the from
[1:02:08] the garden all the way down he was in
[1:02:10] flesh he's about to fulfill his life's
[1:02:12] role amen fulfilling the scripture
[1:02:14] and they were missing it
[1:02:16] because they weren't caught up in
[1:02:19] the main thing
[1:02:21] we got to be sure that we're caught up
[1:02:22] in the main thing you know our main
[1:02:25] thing can be the wrong thing it cannot
[1:02:27] be the main thing
[1:02:29] brother ram says in the philadelphian
[1:02:31] church age what was judas's main thing
[1:02:34] it was money
[1:02:35] the biggest pull of a lot of these
[1:02:37] things today is money he had the wrong
[1:02:39] main thing
[1:02:41] money was part of it but it wasn't the
[1:02:42] main thing
[1:02:43] so we want to be very sure that we
[1:02:47] stick with the main thing
[1:02:51] now
[1:02:52] brother brown he makes a lot of
[1:02:53] different statements when he when he
[1:02:55] uses the phrase the main thing or main
[1:02:57] thing
[1:02:58] you should go away and look at it is
[1:02:59] everyone happy today everyone's here
[1:03:01] we're in the greatest season
[1:03:04] you know it says after you read genesis
[1:03:07] 5 you know it speaks about adam's
[1:03:09] lineage and it says then man began to
[1:03:11] call upon the name of the lord because
[1:03:13] adam and eve they would be sitting
[1:03:14] around maybe the fire fire at night with
[1:03:16] their children look up the stars of
[1:03:17] heaven then they would be preaching from
[1:03:19] you know all the way through the zodiac
[1:03:21] because god's first bible is written in
[1:03:22] the heavens we know we don't read that
[1:03:24] one no more this is our bible
[1:03:26] right so they would be under actually
[1:03:28] use the use what was in the heaven
[1:03:30] because that's god's word first right
[1:03:32] and they would begin to preach their
[1:03:34] children what's going to happen the plan
[1:03:35] of redemption and they would testify no
[1:03:38] doubt amen of of the lord's promise to
[1:03:40] them when he wrapped them in lamb skins
[1:03:42] that that that the seed of the woman's
[1:03:44] going to come and undo i mean what the
[1:03:46] devil's done it says then man began to
[1:03:48] call upon the name of the lord so from
[1:03:51] then till now the real believers been
[1:03:53] calling on god
[1:03:54] when is sin going to be done away with
[1:03:56] when is eternity going to roll on when's
[1:03:58] time going to be no more when are these
[1:04:00] things going to happen when is heaven
[1:04:01] and earth going to come back together
[1:04:02] again
[1:04:03] hallelujah and we happen to be living in
[1:04:05] that time
[1:04:07] this is a great time to be alive and
[1:04:09] hallelujah
[1:04:11] so we don't want to be caught up in
[1:04:12] carnality of people
[1:04:14] or what's going on in the world and miss
[1:04:16] the main thing
[1:04:19] i mean there's a lot of things brother
[1:04:20] brown called the main thing here's a
[1:04:21] list of some of them and this is not in
[1:04:23] any order of importance
[1:04:25] but getting soul saved is the main thing
[1:04:28] getting the baptism of the holy ghost in
[1:04:30] your soul it's the main thing
[1:04:32] keeping love among the brethren the main
[1:04:34] thing
[1:04:34] i mean having the lord present in the
[1:04:36] meetings it's the main thing
[1:04:38] i mean staying humble the main thing
[1:04:41] not being caught up with the things of
[1:04:42] the world that's the main thing saying
[1:04:44] with the word the main thing receiving
[1:04:47] christ the main thing being ready for
[1:04:49] the rapture the main thing living a
[1:04:51] sermon rather than preaching a sermon
[1:04:53] the main thing having the blood tag the
[1:04:55] main thing
[1:04:56] getting ready to meet him the main thing
[1:04:59] some of these may repeat but hey this is
[1:05:01] just how i've written them down doing
[1:05:02] the will of god the main thing having
[1:05:04] the spirit of the lord in the church the
[1:05:06] main thing not being scared of sickness
[1:05:08] when it strikes the main thing jesus
[1:05:11] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:05:13] forever that's the main thing
[1:05:15] loving god and humbling yourself the
[1:05:16] main thing
[1:05:18] live what you're talking about the main
[1:05:20] thing there's a lot of main things
[1:05:22] you say well how can there be multiple
[1:05:24] main things because to me it comes down
[1:05:26] to one thing
[1:05:28] amen the person of jesus christ living
[1:05:30] in you
[1:05:31] amen to me his life manifesting his word
[1:05:34] through you and i that's the main thing
[1:05:36] because all of those things boil down to
[1:05:38] that
[1:05:39] amen because if he's in you you've got a
[1:05:41] burden for the loss of getting soul
[1:05:43] saved
[1:05:44] amen having love among the brethren god
[1:05:46] is love and that's not some wishy-washy
[1:05:48] instagram post that's a reality
[1:05:50] amen divine love is christ himself
[1:05:52] that's the main thing staying humble
[1:05:54] well if you've got his character you
[1:05:55] will be humble
[1:05:57] the main thing
[1:05:59] hallelujah so there's a lot of main
[1:06:00] things and the main thing is that his
[1:06:02] life his word puts on flesh and you and
[1:06:04] i
[1:06:05] amen i love it where the apostle paul
[1:06:06] will say galatians 2 and 20 i'm
[1:06:08] crucified with christ nevertheless i
[1:06:11] live not yet i but christ liveth in me
[1:06:13] and the life which i now live in the
[1:06:15] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:06:18] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:06:21] amen the apostle paul met the main thing
[1:06:24] on the road to damascus and he began to
[1:06:26] realize the life he now lived in the
[1:06:28] flesh he wasn't living it by his own
[1:06:31] understanding his own revelation his own
[1:06:33] religious works but it was the
[1:06:35] revelation the faith of the son of god
[1:06:38] was manifesting himself through his life
[1:06:41] amen so the same one that said let there
[1:06:43] be sun moon and stars amen was now
[1:06:46] living in his life so his life he was
[1:06:48] the life he was living in the flesh he
[1:06:50] was living by the faith of the son of
[1:06:52] god so everything he did it was by that
[1:06:54] faith
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:56] whether it was making tense it was by
[1:06:58] that faith preaching to someone by that
[1:07:00] faith being led by the spirit of god it
[1:07:02] was by the faith of the son of god
[1:07:05] hallelujah
[1:07:06] amen now naturally well for some reason
[1:07:10] man seems to put things in when you when
[1:07:13] you emphasize one thing you know i just
[1:07:15] say it like this
[1:07:17] speaking about god living in a people is
[1:07:19] not diminishing the opening of the word
[1:07:22] right come on this message came that god
[1:07:26] would make us powerhouses of his holy
[1:07:28] ghost i mean the dynamics of the work
[1:07:31] the the mechanics of the word the
[1:07:32] dynamics the holy ghost will come
[1:07:34] together live in you and shake the world
[1:07:36] amen because god is going to rapture
[1:07:38] people full of himself
[1:07:40] amen that's what he's looking for right
[1:07:43] he's not looking he's not looking for
[1:07:45] people who can just quote the word the
[1:07:46] devil can quote the word in every
[1:07:48] language under heaven even those
[1:07:49] languages that are now extinct but he's
[1:07:51] not going in a rapture amen the only
[1:07:54] ones going to rapture is that god
[1:07:56] tabernacled in you
[1:07:58] hallelujah so to say these things is not
[1:08:01] to diminish what what about the opening
[1:08:03] of the seals the seals reveals christ
[1:08:06] right if you just see four horse riders
[1:08:08] in a tribulation and different things
[1:08:09] you've got to look again there's christ
[1:08:10] in there
[1:08:12] it reveals christ the prophet said
[1:08:14] amen he also says in desperations that
[1:08:17] all so he's speaking about what he just
[1:08:19] preached in the morning which was the
[1:08:21] token message
[1:08:22] that you've got to have the token the
[1:08:23] holy ghost
[1:08:25] all these signs of the holy spirit
[1:08:26] leading up then come right back here to
[1:08:29] the capping off of all those messengers
[1:08:31] messages since the seven seals it's
[1:08:33] capped off in this one thing the token
[1:08:36] the cap is the top of it so it says all
[1:08:38] these things but it's capped off by you
[1:08:40] must have the literal life of jesus
[1:08:42] christ in you
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:45] that we are all right see just check
[1:08:47] ourselves and see if we're in the faith
[1:08:51] amen now we've got to understand as well
[1:08:53] that when the spirit of truth has come
[1:08:55] he'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:08:56] truth
[1:08:57] right personally you remember this is
[1:09:00] all truth but you've got to be led in
[1:09:01] god guided into it right it's going to
[1:09:04] become reality to you and i what by the
[1:09:06] spirit of revelation
[1:09:08] amen so that's why i can say it's the
[1:09:09] main thing you've got to be born again
[1:09:12] amen if you really have the spirit of
[1:09:13] god you'll be led and guided into all
[1:09:15] truth
[1:09:16] okay
[1:09:17] amen someone speaking to brother brown i
[1:09:19] think it was brother booth here i'm not
[1:09:21] sure who that was bc as well
[1:09:23] he says the reason said you don't know
[1:09:25] your bible
[1:09:26] he said that's all said if you can't
[1:09:28] speak greek you don't know the bible i
[1:09:30] said brother booth that might be wrong i
[1:09:33] might not know the book but i know the
[1:09:35] author real well i said i said that's it
[1:09:38] that's the main thing
[1:09:39] if you know the author he will take care
[1:09:42] of the book part
[1:09:43] of you and so that's the way we love him
[1:09:45] tonight and it brings it down to a
[1:09:47] simple person as i has a right to be
[1:09:50] saved it means if you know the author
[1:09:52] he'll take care of the book part
[1:09:54] hallelujah so we don't need to try and
[1:09:55] struggle and yeah he'll take care of it
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:00] i'm so thankful that
[1:10:02] where the apostle paul would say in
[1:10:03] second corinthians 3
[1:10:06] he says now this now the spirit
[1:10:08] the the lord is that spirit and where
[1:10:10] the spirit of the lord is there is
[1:10:12] liberty and that liberty means actually
[1:10:14] liberated into sonship
[1:10:17] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:10:19] in a glass the glory of the lord are
[1:10:21] changed into the same image from glory
[1:10:22] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:10:25] lord it means this is the lord leading
[1:10:27] and guiding into all truth because when
[1:10:28] it becomes a revelation
[1:10:30] amen it actually forms more of the
[1:10:32] character of christ than you and i that
[1:10:34] is to me the outworking i've got a
[1:10:35] revelation as you become more like him
[1:10:39] amen so if we change from glory to glory
[1:10:41] he's changing us from glory to glory as
[1:10:43] we behold him what the word is open
[1:10:46] amen now he's doing it by revelation
[1:10:49] upon revelation and he is his word he's
[1:10:51] changing our character into his i mean
[1:10:53] so from glory to glory revelation to
[1:10:55] revelation we're becoming more like him
[1:10:58] amen i trust that's your heart's desire
[1:11:00] it doesn't matter what you see yourself
[1:11:02] as lord i want to behold you in your
[1:11:04] word make me more like you
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] hallelujah he would say in leadership
[1:11:10] this is the end of his ministry 1965
[1:11:12] this is one of the last sermons he's
[1:11:14] ever going to preach before he is taken
[1:11:16] off the face of the earth
[1:11:18] he says
[1:11:20] because remember we're going to die
[1:11:22] someday or either be translated into
[1:11:25] heaven and if you die before it's coming
[1:11:27] you'll be raptured first you know that
[1:11:29] did you uh did you know that those who
[1:11:31] are dead if mama and papa dies before
[1:11:33] you do and jesus doesn't come in our
[1:11:35] generation do you know these mama papa
[1:11:38] um will come forth first glorified
[1:11:40] before you see the trumpet of god shall
[1:11:42] sound the dead in christ shall rise
[1:11:44] first and when we which are alive and
[1:11:46] remain shall be caught up with them
[1:11:47] we'll be changed like that we've got to
[1:11:50] remember it's the main thing in life
[1:11:52] you understand now that's the main thing
[1:11:54] in life we've got to do is get ready to
[1:11:57] meet god
[1:11:58] that's the main thing
[1:12:00] hallelujah
[1:12:02] he would preach in the message oncoming
[1:12:04] storm he says the people today are so
[1:12:07] comfortable in sin because we own a new
[1:12:09] car because we eat three meals a day
[1:12:11] sleep in a clean bed oh that's wonderful
[1:12:13] but what what would be good but we
[1:12:16] forget god when prosperity comes like
[1:12:18] that i think we've been so we preachers
[1:12:20] and we christians have been so
[1:12:21] interested in the program building of
[1:12:24] our churches and getting a better church
[1:12:26] or something like a bigger church better
[1:12:28] pews or you know what i mean we've left
[1:12:31] off the main thing
[1:12:32] judgment righteousness the power of the
[1:12:34] holy ghost resurrection eternal judgment
[1:12:37] hallelujah those are the main things
[1:12:39] amen i'm glad we can preach the main
[1:12:41] thing i'm glad the main thing can be the
[1:12:43] main thrust of our life
[1:12:45] hallelujah
[1:12:47] amen he says that a thinking man's
[1:12:49] filter now if you want to go listen to a
[1:12:51] message that really kind of checks you
[1:12:53] up that's a good one to listen to
[1:12:56] i'm talking about myself as well because
[1:12:57] i'm human
[1:12:59] everyone should say amen
[1:13:02] wow okay anyway we'll leave that one
[1:13:03] alone no a thinking man's filter
[1:13:06] he says now
[1:13:08] let us all tonight check our desires
[1:13:11] remember
[1:13:12] judas's desire was towards money so it
[1:13:14] became his main thing
[1:13:16] right the disciples wanted their them to
[1:13:19] be the greatest and their position in
[1:13:20] the body was more important than the
[1:13:22] main thing christ fulfilling his word in
[1:13:23] their day
[1:13:25] right so we've got to check our desires
[1:13:27] what you really want in life
[1:13:30] check what you're fighting for there's a
[1:13:32] lot of people fighting for a lot of
[1:13:33] things in this day and i'll say they're
[1:13:35] lost causes
[1:13:37] because the word says we're going into a
[1:13:38] millennium this world's gonna burn
[1:13:41] right so politics they can have it amen
[1:13:44] the environment they can have it
[1:13:46] whatever they can have it just take the
[1:13:48] whole world give me jesus you can have
[1:13:50] it all just just go for it let me have
[1:13:53] jesus
[1:13:54] check what you're fighting for check
[1:13:56] what you're you're here for
[1:13:59] check what you go to church for
[1:14:01] amen it's good to go to church but don't
[1:14:03] just go to church only that won't save
[1:14:05] you see just check for a few minutes is
[1:14:07] my objective what kind of a filter am i
[1:14:10] i'm drawing through anyhow and if you
[1:14:12] won't cope with the word of god and your
[1:14:14] soul don't do it then there's something
[1:14:16] wrong for it shows up your taste what
[1:14:18] kind of life is in you
[1:14:20] if it's wholly discreet and honorable
[1:14:22] it'll come out that way if it isn't
[1:14:24] you've got another taste in you you're
[1:14:25] drawing from that's exactly right and if
[1:14:28] the taste is the word of god and the
[1:14:30] will of god
[1:14:31] then you know what's in you what's
[1:14:33] drawing the taste shows that you're a
[1:14:36] part of the word the word is in you
[1:14:37] drawing from the word
[1:14:39] what what's a drawing it's drawing
[1:14:41] through the word because you're part of
[1:14:42] the body of christ of this age and if
[1:14:45] that word is in you it can only draw
[1:14:47] through the word the spirit that
[1:14:48] quickens that word that's in you just
[1:14:51] the word alone won't live that's the
[1:14:53] reason all the father has given me will
[1:14:56] come to me and if i be lifted up i'll
[1:14:58] draw all men unto me see the father the
[1:15:00] part of the body of christ that's in the
[1:15:02] world predestinated put into the heart
[1:15:05] any man that's a real christian born
[1:15:07] again today knows since he was a little
[1:15:08] kid or a little girl either there's been
[1:15:10] something in you hungering for god and
[1:15:13] you've tried joining churches and
[1:15:14] everything else it wouldn't work what
[1:15:16] was it it was that word you were hunting
[1:15:18] for a filter and one day it flashed
[1:15:21] before you seen jesus christ the same
[1:15:23] yesterday today and forever that
[1:15:25] satisfied the taste see
[1:15:27] hallelujah see what a what a chick what
[1:15:29] are we fighting for what do we really
[1:15:30] want in life
[1:15:32] now when he says about your drawing
[1:15:34] through the filter he doesn't say how
[1:15:35] successful that you're viewing your
[1:15:36] christian life it's what's your desire
[1:15:39] what's in your heart what do you really
[1:15:40] want
[1:15:41] i want to see jesus live i want to
[1:15:43] become more like him i want him to be
[1:15:45] glorified i mean i want to go on a
[1:15:48] rapture i want my family to be saved i
[1:15:50] want them to go on a rapture oh and all
[1:15:52] i want this building to be empty when
[1:15:54] the rapture goes because there's no one
[1:15:55] can come here because we're all gone
[1:15:57] that's what i want to see amen that's
[1:15:59] what my desire is that's what we're
[1:16:01] fighting for that's what we're we're
[1:16:03] contending for the main thing i mean the
[1:16:05] word of god will be manifested in our
[1:16:06] lives irrespective of our failures our
[1:16:09] traits our quirks whatever trouble we
[1:16:11] may be facing that's irrelevant my
[1:16:13] desire is i want to see jesus christ and
[1:16:15] him glorified in his people amen this
[1:16:17] message put on flesh and you and i
[1:16:19] that's what i want i mean the quotes
[1:16:21] become flesh that's what i want to see
[1:16:23] hallelujah where he says that she'd be
[1:16:25] an invincible army i want to see an
[1:16:27] invincible army we know an army is not
[1:16:29] invincible unless it's been tested on
[1:16:31] the battlefield i mean it's got to go
[1:16:33] through wars it's got to go through
[1:16:34] campaigns amen there may be a lot of
[1:16:36] maybe some defeats along the way but
[1:16:38] we'll come out victorious
[1:16:41] hallelujah
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:44] she will be an invincible army i believe
[1:16:46] i'm looking at part of that body
[1:16:49] right here
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:53] the main thing is that we have the chief
[1:16:55] captain
[1:16:56] that's the main thing the main thing is
[1:16:58] not us trying to fight our own battles
[1:17:01] we'll fail miserably but the main thing
[1:17:03] is if he's fighting your battles
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:07] now
[1:17:09] simon i mean you could go through all
[1:17:10] the way through the scripture you can
[1:17:12] see those that missed the main thing but
[1:17:14] those that got the main thing that's
[1:17:15] really what emphasizes those that really
[1:17:17] got the main thing in their day
[1:17:20] now simon the pharisee he missed the
[1:17:22] main thing when he invited jesus
[1:17:24] his main thing is he wanted just to make
[1:17:26] fun of him and have a different kind of
[1:17:29] entertainment for his guest something
[1:17:31] that was kind of unique to kind of boost
[1:17:33] his prestige that was his main thing
[1:17:36] but i'm so thankful there was a woman
[1:17:38] who wasn't even invited but she saw the
[1:17:41] main thing
[1:17:42] i mean she got the main thing she saw
[1:17:43] that jesus was was sure he was invited
[1:17:46] but he wasn't made welcome he was in the
[1:17:48] corner with unwashed feet not anointed
[1:17:50] not made welcome he was sitting there
[1:17:52] with stinking feet
[1:17:54] amen and she saw that is not the main
[1:17:56] thing
[1:17:57] to leave him uninvited but she she
[1:18:00] purpose in her heart i want to make the
[1:18:02] lord of glory i want to make this
[1:18:03] prophet of galilee feel welcome
[1:18:07] hallelujah and so she saw the main thing
[1:18:09] is that jesus had a need he had to be
[1:18:12] made welcome in this feast i pray that
[1:18:15] every day we make jesus feel welcome i
[1:18:17] mean we don't have a bad attitude we
[1:18:19] don't fuss we don't fight we don't argue
[1:18:21] don't resent anything because that just
[1:18:23] drives him away but we want to have a
[1:18:25] sweet humble atmosphere around us a
[1:18:27] loving heart we want him to draw close
[1:18:31] you know
[1:18:32] we can't allow our walk with god just to
[1:18:34] become a working relationship a working
[1:18:37] relationship just takes things for
[1:18:38] granted
[1:18:40] you know it's just oh well i'm the bride
[1:18:42] he's the bridegroom praise the lord i'm
[1:18:44] going
[1:18:45] that has just become a working
[1:18:47] relationship that grieves the lord
[1:18:50] he doesn't want us to be some working
[1:18:52] you know here's my jo what's my job
[1:18:54] description sign two copies you keep one
[1:18:56] lord i keep the other one and this is my
[1:18:59] contractual obligations and 40 hours a
[1:19:01] week and this is how much i get paid you
[1:19:04] know this is not how it works i mean but
[1:19:06] people can allow the message to become
[1:19:09] like that well i've heard it before and
[1:19:11] this is this and oh yeah these people
[1:19:13] like this and you know no it shouldn't
[1:19:15] be that way it should thrill our souls
[1:19:17] i mean the lord of glory i'm glad i'm
[1:19:19] married to him
[1:19:21] i don't take him for granted we should
[1:19:22] never take jesus for granted we should
[1:19:25] never get to a place say well well i'm
[1:19:27] predicting that i mean i'm the word made
[1:19:29] flesh no we can't just it can't become a
[1:19:31] working relationship
[1:19:33] should be full of
[1:19:34] joy hallelujah why wait for the winning
[1:19:37] supper to start the honeymoon in the
[1:19:39] millennium why don't you start it now
[1:19:41] have that kind of atmosphere around you
[1:19:43] isn't he wonderful isn't he good
[1:19:45] hallelujah
[1:19:47] so we should always make him feel
[1:19:48] welcome in our lives
[1:19:51] irrespective of what we're facing the
[1:19:53] battles in our mind the troubles going
[1:19:55] on remember we don't worship god because
[1:19:57] all the trouble's over
[1:19:59] no we are told in the scripture he sets
[1:20:02] a table before me in the presence of my
[1:20:04] enemies
[1:20:05] that's where he feeds his people right
[1:20:07] in front of the devil's face
[1:20:09] i mean in satan's eden he says look
[1:20:11] here's a seven-course banquet feast amen
[1:20:14] that's been reserved for you in this end
[1:20:17] time hallelujah i mean this mountain of
[1:20:19] bread to eat hallelujah this word that's
[1:20:21] come open and where does he set it he
[1:20:23] doesn't set it by the by the sea or some
[1:20:26] beautiful panoramic place he sets it
[1:20:28] right in front of where the devil is he
[1:20:31] says bride you just sit here and you eat
[1:20:33] i mean don't worry about all this and
[1:20:35] his fussing and fighting and trouble and
[1:20:37] don't worry about those things you just
[1:20:39] sit here and feast on the word
[1:20:41] hallelujah and then what happens is you
[1:20:43] get anointed
[1:20:44] hallelujah amen your cup wrath over for
[1:20:47] joy hallelujah because it's not you're
[1:20:49] not rejoicing because the enemy's there
[1:20:51] or what's or or he's not there it's no
[1:20:54] because you're feasting at the
[1:20:55] banqueting table of the lord he's
[1:20:57] invited you to this place and when i
[1:21:00] point here i'm not talking to these four
[1:21:01] walls i'm talking to
[1:21:03] the word talk about the word
[1:21:05] hallelujah
[1:21:06] so it's not about the troubles the mind
[1:21:08] battles those things you know
[1:21:11] that does not gauge our success as a
[1:21:13] christian
[1:21:15] our the success of christianity is do we
[1:21:18] have we become one with our sacrifice
[1:21:22] right is his life in you and i
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:25] are we sealed to the day of our
[1:21:26] redemption that's really the success of
[1:21:28] our christianity everything else is a
[1:21:30] bonus
[1:21:31] that's well that's my opinion i'm going
[1:21:33] to heaven i'm pretty happy with that
[1:21:35] hallelujah it doesn't matter how
[1:21:37] yeah
[1:21:38] how hard the journey may be the lord
[1:21:40] will lead me through
[1:21:41] i'm sealed
[1:21:43] hallelujah you simplify things too much
[1:21:45] no i don't think i do
[1:21:48] but there's a complicated age we live in
[1:21:50] no no it's all going to be no it's not
[1:21:52] even going to be a memory it's actually
[1:21:54] really quite a simple age i mean the
[1:21:56] messenger has come the word has come
[1:21:58] open and that word seals and elected
[1:22:01] people a way of that age and then once
[1:22:04] that's done the dead in christ are going
[1:22:05] to rise we're going to go on a rapture
[1:22:07] that's really the summation of this

[1:22:13] you know socioeconomic troubles and the
[1:22:16] i don't know about that

[1:22:25] the main thing i'm focused on the main
[1:22:26] thing
[1:22:28] hallelujah so the woman with the
[1:22:29] alabaster box
[1:22:31] i mean she saw the main thing is jesus
[1:22:33] needed his feet washed
[1:22:35] he needed to be made welcome so she was
[1:22:38] willing now to push through
[1:22:40] every obstacle to fulfill the main thing
[1:22:44] amy see brother bam says here and um
[1:22:46] what do we got here then uh this is in
[1:22:48] the message pride

[1:23:04] on her road to meet jesus

[1:23:37] because i see what the main thing is
[1:23:41] could you elbow your way over the
[1:23:43] vulgarity over the picture shows and the
[1:23:45] dancing and the carrying on that you do
[1:23:48] calling yourself a christian to get to
[1:23:49] jesus so can you deny what you're can
[1:23:52] you elbow through what you're caught up
[1:23:53] in
[1:23:54] to get to jesus

[1:24:00] worldly social entertainment
[1:24:02] to come to the lord jesus to be
[1:24:03] entertained by him

[1:24:17] this is how we celebrate this is how we
[1:24:20] worship this is how we praise
[1:24:22] this is a satisfying thing that you
[1:24:24] don't wake up the next morning with a
[1:24:26] dull regret
[1:24:28] hallelujah i want to be entertained by
[1:24:30] jesus come entertain me
[1:24:32] hallelujah
[1:24:34] and that entertainment is not like the
[1:24:36] world just to excite people for a season
[1:24:38] that entertainment is him pouring his
[1:24:40] divine revelation into your soul
[1:24:42] make us more like him taking all our
[1:24:44] cares and our worries away that we can
[1:24:46] see
[1:24:47] well even if he doesn't take them away
[1:24:49] he's still the main thing amen
[1:24:51] hallelujah
[1:24:54] she elbowed right on through i said he
[1:24:56] said god have mercy she elbowed right on
[1:24:58] through she was going to get there
[1:24:59] regardless of how vile
[1:25:02] she was
[1:25:03] oh
[1:25:04] i know it was out of order
[1:25:06] oh sure that was totally out of order it
[1:25:08] wasn't on
[1:25:09] uh
[1:25:10] simon the pharisees list of things that
[1:25:13] would happen in that feast
[1:25:14] there was nowhere in the schedule would
[1:25:16] be woman with alabaster box enter stage
[1:25:18] left and just change the whole scene it
[1:25:20] was completely out of order but in god's
[1:25:23] economy it was the order
[1:25:25] amen if we could just get out of water
[1:25:27] brother graham says i oh i know it was
[1:25:29] out of order oh sure god help us get out
[1:25:32] of order once in a while
[1:25:34] she's saying may god help you may god
[1:25:36] help me get out of order lord enable me
[1:25:38] to get out of order once in a while the
[1:25:41] trouble of it is you've got too much
[1:25:43] order what's that the devil says sit
[1:25:45] there shut up you know oh you'll cause
[1:25:48] this trouble
[1:25:49] who cares about commotion if it's god
[1:25:51] doing it you know i marvel i just i love
[1:25:54] to watch god move
[1:25:56] you know and we are watching i come in
[1:25:57] what song we're watching with the girls
[1:25:59] eating like tabernacle and you know all
[1:26:01] the young young girls are dancing around
[1:26:03] the church which is scriptural the
[1:26:04] maidens will dance yes
[1:26:05] but somehow they don't crash into each
[1:26:07] other
[1:26:09] they just don't they somehow just do
[1:26:11] this and you know
[1:26:12] and it's not choreographed that's for
[1:26:13] sure i said well that's just the holy
[1:26:15] ghost doing it because if it was carnal
[1:26:17] they would bump into each other
[1:26:20] hallelujah but what happened is they got
[1:26:22] out of order
[1:26:24] he says now the trouble of it is you got
[1:26:26] too much order
[1:26:28] get out of order he says i hope the
[1:26:30] church gets out of order long enough to
[1:26:32] get saved
[1:26:34] hallelujah
[1:26:37] amen he says i remember when jesus saved
[1:26:39] me oh my i'll never forget it
[1:26:41] this little old kentucky heart of mine
[1:26:43] was jumping 90 miles an hour i wept i
[1:26:46] cried i shouted i don't care who was
[1:26:48] standing around i wasn't paying
[1:26:50] attention to order i was in the presence
[1:26:52] of jesus i loved him
[1:26:55] she wasn't noticing how much order she
[1:26:57] was in or how much she was out of it the
[1:26:59] main thing was get to jesus see she knew
[1:27:02] the main thing i've got to get to that
[1:27:04] man
[1:27:05] hallelujah there he's hit with dirty
[1:27:07] feet he sit without being kissed he
[1:27:09] wasn't welcome and she wanted to make
[1:27:11] him welcome she didn't care about their
[1:27:14] old pharisaical orders about their old
[1:27:17] traditions and nominations she was
[1:27:19] pressing her way through to get to jesus
[1:27:22] god help us to have a revival like that
[1:27:24] where men and women will elbow their way
[1:27:26] through the crowds and denominations and
[1:27:28] the barriers till they get in the
[1:27:31] presence of jesus
[1:27:33] hallelujah that's what we want isn't it
[1:27:35] get through every barrier every ism
[1:27:37] every cold spell you know
[1:27:40] don't let no cold feeling devil get you
[1:27:43] down
[1:27:44] cold feeling come around no you're
[1:27:46] greater than that thing your god is
[1:27:48] greater than that thing oh it's some
[1:27:49] numb feeling in different faith that's
[1:27:51] just a spirit yes that thing's not going
[1:27:53] to rule my life
[1:27:55] hallelujah and now i'm not going by
[1:27:57] emotion but if you've got love you feel
[1:27:59] it
[1:28:00] i don't tell christine i love her every
[1:28:02] day because it's just something to say
[1:28:04] it's i feel it
[1:28:06] hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:28:07] with us and the lord if we really love
[1:28:09] him we should feel that love
[1:28:12] hallelujah exactly
[1:28:14] amen
[1:28:15] now remember now here we are he says he
[1:28:18] says
[1:28:19] use every opportunity to get to jesus
[1:28:22] that's the main thing
[1:28:24] don't be hooked up with the affairs of
[1:28:26] the world
[1:28:27] we spend too much time on those things
[1:28:29] make your way to him and when you're
[1:28:31] there pour out your soul to him she says
[1:28:34] that's the main thing
[1:28:35] either i believe i'm looking at a group
[1:28:37] of people who know the main thing so i'm
[1:28:39] not telling you something you don't know
[1:28:41] or something that's i trust is not alien
[1:28:43] so amen this is just you know what we
[1:28:44] should do just the main thing make your
[1:28:46] every opportunity to get to jesus that's
[1:28:48] the main thing amen
[1:28:50] now he says and hear ye him
[1:28:52] now jesus is no respect of groups jesus
[1:28:55] met all kinds of groups all sizes all
[1:28:58] walks of life one time we have a record
[1:29:00] of a meeting with 500 some times with
[1:29:03] thousands one time we see him with
[1:29:05] twelve
[1:29:06] sometime once he was three and even to
[1:29:09] one no matter the size of group the main
[1:29:12] thing is jesus is there to meet with
[1:29:15] that group
[1:29:16] that's the main thing
[1:29:17] no matter how small your church is or
[1:29:19] how large it is how many how many you
[1:29:22] preach you the question is are you so
[1:29:23] committed to god that jesus meets in
[1:29:26] your company
[1:29:28] i want him to be here
[1:29:30] i want him more than more than great
[1:29:32] singing more than great worship more
[1:29:34] than preaching whatever you know
[1:29:35] intellectual speeches i the main thing
[1:29:38] is that jesus is there to meet with that
[1:29:40] group
[1:29:41] that's what we want isn't it
[1:29:44] amen it's part of the main thing
[1:29:46] hallelujah
[1:29:48] amen but you see now
[1:29:49] when people get into the prince of god
[1:29:51] it causes a reaction
[1:29:54] right there's a supernatural being that
[1:29:56] these bodies aren't aren't accustomed to
[1:29:58] being that kind of presence it causes a
[1:30:00] reaction it causes something to happen
[1:30:02] you see the the world is anointed by
[1:30:05] demon power and that causes things to
[1:30:07] happen
[1:30:08] now that's on the negative side what
[1:30:09] about the positive side remember this is
[1:30:11] the day when the form and the latter
[1:30:13] rain are running together
[1:30:14] i mean words whereas a teaching and the
[1:30:16] quickening anointing comes to anoint
[1:30:19] quicken that teaching to us right that
[1:30:21] the word becomes reality it goes from
[1:30:23] theory to reality
[1:30:25] i mean so both of those rains are
[1:30:27] falling together the teaching rain and
[1:30:29] the quicketing rain
[1:30:31] hallelujah so now if they are running
[1:30:32] together i'd say that our services
[1:30:34] should be more anointed
[1:30:36] our lives should be more anointed
[1:30:38] hallelujah remember there's no plateau
[1:30:41] in this walk and luther's age as far as
[1:30:44] they could live was the joshua lived by
[1:30:46] faith and they got to that plateau they
[1:30:48] couldn't go any higher i mean the
[1:30:50] methods come along john wesley second
[1:30:52] worker of grace sanctification a bit
[1:30:53] higher than being just justified that's
[1:30:55] as high as they could go and then the
[1:30:57] pentecostal move was just the
[1:30:59] restoration of the gifts i mean it was
[1:31:01] higher than just being justified or
[1:31:02] sanctified that's as high as they could
[1:31:04] go but now when malachi 4 has come and
[1:31:06] opened up the fullness of the word i
[1:31:08] mean there's no plateau there's no
[1:31:10] ceiling to this thing
[1:31:11] i mean it's just endless glory to glory
[1:31:14] from eternity to eternity i mean so we
[1:31:17] can't just plateau
[1:31:19] well how do you know you've arrived i'll
[1:31:20] tell you when your body's changed you've
[1:31:22] arrived
[1:31:23] i mean when your body has changed you
[1:31:25] have arrived but until then i want more
[1:31:28] of jesus more and more and more i want
[1:31:30] more of jesus than i ever had before
[1:31:32] that's what i want and he's got more to
[1:31:34] give amen
[1:31:36] you know god is not a reluctant
[1:31:38] giver
[1:31:40] amen he loves to pour himself out he
[1:31:42] loves to give impart revelation to his
[1:31:45] bride
[1:31:46] hallelujah
[1:31:48] amen but it causes
[1:31:50] it causes a reaction i'm going to come
[1:31:53] to that soon but he says here
[1:31:55] one of the main things
[1:31:58] he says and and that's what your prayer
[1:32:00] life does for the believer that's what
[1:32:02] they that's what daily keeps the world
[1:32:04] out of you is when you pitch yourself on
[1:32:06] your knees and say lord jesus and the
[1:32:08] blood comes down and it seals you all up
[1:32:10] so the devil can't get you see that's
[1:32:12] right and oh so many times the people go
[1:32:15] around and say it's awful but that don't
[1:32:17] make any difference it keeps you safe
[1:32:19] that's the main thing
[1:32:20] keep safe see your old fashioned that
[1:32:22] doesn't matter it keeps you safe i mean
[1:32:25] so when you daily commit your life to
[1:32:27] god in the morning when you get up say
[1:32:28] lord fill me amen cover me with your
[1:32:30] blood protect me i may no longer be me
[1:32:33] living but you living in me
[1:32:35] take my life and use this vessel of clay
[1:32:37] for your glory through the day what does
[1:32:38] it do it keeps you safe
[1:32:40] because you've you've committed your
[1:32:42] life to the lord so it doesn't matter if
[1:32:44] it's good or good or bad happen to you
[1:32:46] in the day
[1:32:47] that's a that's the law's prerogative
[1:32:50] right everything that happens to us is
[1:32:52] for our good we may not understand
[1:32:55] at that point in time how that was for
[1:32:57] your good but it works for your good
[1:32:59] lord amen so that keeps us safe that's
[1:33:01] the main thing who has to keep safe
[1:33:04] amen
[1:33:05] hallelujah from the devil in his
[1:33:07] amen that may be old-fashioned it
[1:33:09] doesn't matter it keeps
[1:33:11] you safe
[1:33:13] hallelujah he says in a second-handed
[1:33:15] robe that's the main thing in my life
[1:33:17] tonight is to know
[1:33:19] that i know him in the power of his
[1:33:20] resurrection that he lives and reigns
[1:33:23] and i know him by the forgiveness of
[1:33:25] sins
[1:33:26] by his spirit dealing by him moving and
[1:33:28] acting i know that it's him
[1:33:30] amen that's the main thing
[1:33:33] the main thing of it and no matter where
[1:33:35] or what time he comes be ready is the
[1:33:38] main thing
[1:33:39] hallelujah we want to be ready
[1:33:42] amen he says here it is the rising of
[1:33:44] the sun as people today are trying to
[1:33:47] say we should wash feet once a year on
[1:33:49] thursday friday we should take the
[1:33:50] communion and all the doctrines they
[1:33:52] argue about whether it should be on this
[1:33:54] day or that day whether it should be the
[1:33:56] sabbath day or the first day of the week
[1:33:58] all these things are just merely
[1:33:59] tradition what good would any of it do
[1:34:02] whether you had lent or not lent if
[1:34:04] there is no life in you it's only a
[1:34:06] memorial which there's nothing against
[1:34:08] it but they've certainly carried out
[1:34:11] their traditions but left off the main
[1:34:13] thing
[1:34:15] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:34:18] or how right you are in your doctrine if
[1:34:20] you miss that life you won't come up
[1:34:22] anyhow no matter how religious how good
[1:34:24] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:34:27] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:34:29] unless you've been born again therefore
[1:34:31] if god raised up jesus from the dead did
[1:34:33] he raise him up for a memorial and is
[1:34:36] this the resurrection morning only one
[1:34:38] day in the year or a certain day that we
[1:34:39] celebrate this or are we been away or
[1:34:42] are we benefactors of his resurrection
[1:34:45] what does it mean to me what does it
[1:34:46] mean to you now we believe by faith that
[1:34:49] he's raised from the dead but what has
[1:34:51] it got to do with me that was two
[1:34:54] thousand years ago
[1:34:55] he says
[1:34:57] he says now to find this text now
[1:34:59] remember the main thing he's saying is
[1:35:00] they've left off the main thing and the
[1:35:02] main thing is his life and you and i
[1:35:04] right that we become
[1:35:06] beneficiaries of the resurrection
[1:35:08] but then he goes now to find this text
[1:35:11] and as i was tired my arm hurting me
[1:35:14] from the shots the nurse gave me for to
[1:35:16] leave overseas now as you know in a few
[1:35:18] days i must have these shots son and i
[1:35:20] for with cholera yellow fever and
[1:35:22] everything and i'm pretty weary making
[1:35:24] me sick which caesar requires to have
[1:35:27] these shots before you go on to another
[1:35:28] nation he said give caesar that's which
[1:35:30] is caesar's but then give god that
[1:35:33] which is god's so what's he saying there
[1:35:35] that's not the main thing but you've got
[1:35:36] to cater to these things give caesar's
[1:35:38] that which is seasoned but now we're
[1:35:40] going to see are we a beneficiary of the
[1:35:43] resurrection
[1:35:44] amen i'm just kind of
[1:35:46] going this way you probably don't know
[1:35:48] which way that is but we're going this
[1:35:49] way okay
[1:35:50] now
[1:35:51] he says in ephesians 1 and 11.
[1:35:54] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:35:56] inheritance
[1:35:57] being predestinated according to the
[1:35:59] purpose of him who hath worketh all
[1:36:01] things after the council of his own will
[1:36:04] so we have obtained an inheritance right
[1:36:06] so the main thing would be what is in
[1:36:08] that inheritance all right and then he
[1:36:11] says in mark 10 17 and when he has gone
[1:36:13] forth into the way there came one
[1:36:15] running and kneeling to him and asked
[1:36:16] him good master what shall i do that i
[1:36:18] may inherit eternal life
[1:36:20] and then revelations 21 7 he that
[1:36:22] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[1:36:25] i'll be his god and he shall be my son
[1:36:28] hallelujah but we know that the
[1:36:30] inheritance did not come by the law
[1:36:32] i mean as it says in galatians 3 and 18
[1:36:34] for if the inheritance be of the law it
[1:36:36] is no more of promise but god gave it to
[1:36:39] abraham by promise
[1:36:41] amen so now we have an inheritance now
[1:36:44] an adherence we know is something that
[1:36:46] is left to you
[1:36:47] right it says brother brahm says in
[1:36:49] adoption for
[1:36:50] um in 1960 in whom we have obtained an
[1:36:53] inheritance oh and inheritance somebody
[1:36:55] has leave you something to inherit it is
[1:36:57] that right an inheritance what
[1:36:59] inheritance do we have what inheritance
[1:37:01] did i have
[1:37:03] i didn't have any but god left me in
[1:37:05] inheritance when he put my name on the
[1:37:06] lamb's book of life before the
[1:37:08] foundation of the world oh you say now
[1:37:10] wait a minute brother jesus did that
[1:37:12] when he died for you no he never jesus
[1:37:14] come to purchase that inheritance for me
[1:37:18] read the very next line in whom i also
[1:37:21] have obtained uh an inheritance being
[1:37:24] predestined according to the purpose of
[1:37:26] him who worketh all things after the
[1:37:29] council of his own will so when jesus
[1:37:31] died he came that he would purchase our
[1:37:34] inheritance for us
[1:37:36] hallelujah says look having
[1:37:38] predestinated us unto this inheritance
[1:37:41] if i am if i'm a right to inherit
[1:37:45] something if god is knocking at my heart
[1:37:48] saying william branham i called you a
[1:37:50] long time ago before the foundation of
[1:37:51] the world to preach the gospel i have an
[1:37:54] inheritance and inheritance of eternal
[1:37:56] life now god took god sent jesus to make
[1:37:59] that inheritance real to me because
[1:38:02] there was nothing i could do to inherit
[1:38:04] it it was blank it was valid there was
[1:38:07] nothing i could do but in the fullness
[1:38:08] of time god sent in his own time jesus
[1:38:12] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:38:13] the world his blood was shed that i
[1:38:16] might go to my inheritance
[1:38:19] hallelujah i mean to be what one
[1:38:22] adherence to sonship to be a son of god
[1:38:24] so his blood was shed
[1:38:26] that i might go to my inheritance so now
[1:38:28] our inheritance is our sonship our
[1:38:30] position in christ i mean we're the
[1:38:32] devil's under our feet amen and we have
[1:38:35] dominion over him and all of his works
[1:38:37] however we have peace with god that
[1:38:39] we're made in his image amen so his
[1:38:41] blood was shared that we might go to
[1:38:43] that i mean so it doesn't matter where
[1:38:44] we start from that's irrelevant it's
[1:38:46] where we're going that matters i mean
[1:38:48] it's our final destination that matters
[1:38:50] amen so if he if he died on calvary
[1:38:53] because we think what's the main thing
[1:38:55] hallelujah the main thing is god is
[1:38:57] making a bride in his image in this hour
[1:38:59] and we're part of that number by his
[1:39:01] great grace hallelujah so his blood was
[1:39:04] shared that i and i trust you can put
[1:39:06] you in there
[1:39:07] might go to my inheritance i mean so
[1:39:09] that i may have started a slave but i
[1:39:12] but in my inheritance is sonship
[1:39:15] i mean i may have been in darkness and
[1:39:17] treat dead and sins and trespasses but
[1:39:20] in my inheritance is eternal life so
[1:39:22] that he shed his blood that i might go
[1:39:24] to that
[1:39:25] amen that where i was once alienated
[1:39:27] from god separated in my mind by the
[1:39:29] darkness of this world but he shed his
[1:39:31] blood that i might go to my inheritance
[1:39:33] i mean i've been reconciled to christ
[1:39:35] hallelujah
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:39] now the difference between caleb and
[1:39:41] joshua and the others
[1:39:42] they were looking at the circumstances
[1:39:44] and caleb and joshua were looking at
[1:39:46] what god said god said it's yours he
[1:39:48] gave the promise god is obligated to
[1:39:51] keep his word now what do you look at if
[1:39:53] you're looking today to find god to keep
[1:39:55] his word he'll keep it
[1:39:57] but keep your eye on the word just move
[1:40:00] with the word don't leave it stay right
[1:40:02] with the word that's the main thing
[1:40:05] i mean so if we're looking who's looking
[1:40:07] for god to keep his word
[1:40:09] amen he'll do it
[1:40:11] if we're looking for him to fulfill this
[1:40:13] remember we can't bring one part of the
[1:40:15] scripture to pass
[1:40:17] right it's god that fulfills his word we
[1:40:19] can't fulfill his word i mean he has to
[1:40:22] come and fulfill his word in our lives
[1:40:24] but if we're looking see see the main
[1:40:26] thing is to be looking state with his
[1:40:27] word i mean looking that believing and
[1:40:31] looking for him to keep it and he will
[1:40:33] that's the main thing
[1:40:34] not looking at circumstances caleb and
[1:40:36] joshua saw the same giants the same
[1:40:38] cities the same problems the same
[1:40:41] obstacles but that wasn't the main thing
[1:40:44] in their mind the main thing is god has
[1:40:45] given us the land we're going to that
[1:40:47] land amen we're good on here at every
[1:40:49] part of it that's the main thing to them
[1:40:51] amen so they weren't worried about what
[1:40:53] the devil had set up in that place to
[1:40:55] stop them they said god is going to give
[1:40:57] it to us hallelujah says the same thing
[1:40:59] with you and i we have a lot of
[1:41:00] obstacles in this day we have a real
[1:41:02] devil that we're fighting right and he's
[1:41:05] a real slicker he's not some nothing he
[1:41:07] has power
[1:41:09] power of deception
[1:41:10] right and he's real good at it he's been
[1:41:12] spending thousands of years perfecting
[1:41:14] his craft of deception i remember we
[1:41:16] have to recognize that our enemy is a
[1:41:18] defeated enemy today
[1:41:19] i mean here's a defeated foe i mean
[1:41:21] outlawed that down calvary the main
[1:41:23] thing is that the devil was defeated
[1:41:25] that day
[1:41:26] he doesn't even have the keys
[1:41:28] keys to his house anymore
[1:41:30] so we have to recognize that when we
[1:41:32] come against the devil that he is
[1:41:34] defeated
[1:41:35] and he's just as defeated then as he is
[1:41:37] in 2021 and should there be a 2022 he's
[1:41:40] still defeated at 2023 he'll still be
[1:41:43] defeated i mean as long as he's in
[1:41:45] existence he still will be defeated
[1:41:48] doesn't matter how big he gets how
[1:41:49] whatever his threats are and things that
[1:41:52] don't matter we're facing a defeated foe
[1:41:56] amen hallelujah so we should be looking
[1:41:58] amen for god that he will keep his word
[1:42:02] hallelujah just stay with that word
[1:42:03] that's the main thing
[1:42:05] amen don't go with your opinion stay
[1:42:07] with the word
[1:42:09] now he says here in revelations chapter
[1:42:12] five part two now we have the earnest
[1:42:14] the holy spirit is the earnest of our
[1:42:16] inheritance well let's just back up a
[1:42:18] bit do you believe the blood was shared
[1:42:20] for you that you'd go to your
[1:42:21] inheritance

[1:42:25] in your walk there's still more of your
[1:42:26] inheritance to get
[1:42:28] so if you believe that his blood was
[1:42:30] shed for you that you would go into your
[1:42:32] inheritance amy you just keep that the
[1:42:34] main thing
[1:42:35] lord you purchased my inheritance and
[1:42:37] you're here now to ensure that i get my
[1:42:40] inheritance

[1:42:48] blood that was shed amen
[1:42:50] he will
[1:42:52] that you will go to your inheritance so
[1:42:53] it doesn't matter what condition you
[1:42:55] find yourself in today you got to
[1:42:57] believe the blood was shed for you that
[1:42:59] you'll go to your inheritance
[1:43:02] hallelujah
[1:43:04] amen so we have the earnest the holy
[1:43:07] ghost is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:43:09] in other words it's the assurance
[1:43:13] the earnest is the assurance the down
[1:43:15] payment that we have been received into
[1:43:17] christ it is the blessed hope and
[1:43:19] insurance that we do have eternal life
[1:43:22] and our ears to everything that he
[1:43:24] purchased for us
[1:43:25] oh my can you see it oh when we have
[1:43:27] been sealed by the holy ghost i keep
[1:43:29] quoting it because i don't want you to
[1:43:31] miss it it's god's seal of approval
[1:43:34] that everything that christ died for
[1:43:36] belongs to us
[1:43:37] hallelujah so if you receive the holy
[1:43:39] ghost that's god's seal of approval i
[1:43:41] have received your faith
[1:43:43] amen remember it says in hebrews 11 by
[1:43:46] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:43:48] him but you can take the vice versa of
[1:43:51] that with faith it's impossible not to
[1:43:53] please him
[1:43:54] sure you may stumble and fall and trip
[1:43:56] and whatever but with faith it's
[1:43:58] impossible not to please him he gave you
[1:44:00] that faith amen that you would live a
[1:44:02] life pleasing to him hallelujah
[1:44:05] amen so with faith it's impossible not
[1:44:07] to please him
[1:44:09] you got to take that the other way see
[1:44:10] because oh do i believe well why are you
[1:44:12] here

[1:44:22] believer

[1:44:30] category do you want to fall in i'm
[1:44:31] going to be a real believer
[1:44:34] hallelujah not a make-believer not an
[1:44:36] unbeliever i'm a real believer
[1:44:38] i know you know about so-and-so and so
[1:44:40] on so i don't care about so-and-so pray
[1:44:42] for them if you've got to worry about
[1:44:44] instead of shooting it through the
[1:44:45] church pray for them that's the thing
[1:44:47] that's going to help i mean gossip just
[1:44:49] kills people prayer helps
[1:44:51] prayer works prayer changes things
[1:44:54] hallelujah
[1:44:55] it's god's seal of approval see many
[1:44:58] times we wrestle with as god please with
[1:45:01] me well if he's given you the holy ghost
[1:45:05] that's a seal of approval
[1:45:08] i mean it's like my children my children
[1:45:09] are my children
[1:45:10] i love them anyhow they may do all kinds
[1:45:13] of things
[1:45:14] oh boy i do all kinds of things
[1:45:17] but they're still my children they're
[1:45:18] part of me
[1:45:19] hallelujah you know some people get
[1:45:21] upset they call us you know that we that
[1:45:23] we're just an elitist group there's the
[1:45:26] bride and there's not the bride people
[1:45:28] have got it round the wrong way see my
[1:45:30] children are my children
[1:45:32] other children i've never seen them
[1:45:34] upset because i'm their daddy
[1:45:36] it's just it is what it is
[1:45:38] right they are my children they're part
[1:45:40] of me
[1:45:42] so and they can proclaim it all day
[1:45:44] i'm a glory and i'm a glory and i'm a
[1:45:45] gloom you know
[1:45:47] that's just how it is
[1:45:49] right it's the same thing with the bride
[1:45:50] of jesus christ
[1:45:52] we say i'm the bride i'm the bride on
[1:45:54] the bright well oh you're just being
[1:45:56] elite no no he chose me i can't help
[1:45:59] that i wasn't looking for him he found
[1:46:01] me he was hunting me and he found me in
[1:46:04] the depths of sin and darkness
[1:46:06] he found me i wasn't looking for him he
[1:46:08] found me so if he found me he allowed me
[1:46:11] to respond back to his call i'm just
[1:46:13] happy he found me
[1:46:15] hallelujah i'm not putting anyone out
[1:46:18] that's that's their business
[1:46:20] because remember
[1:46:22] the individual puts themselves out of
[1:46:24] heaven
[1:46:26] it's not god putting people out of
[1:46:28] heaven it's actually because remember we
[1:46:30] have choice
[1:46:31] and god does not override our free
[1:46:33] choice
[1:46:34] right he presents which one do you want
[1:46:37] to do
[1:46:38] and brother brown even says in a place
[1:46:39] that people actually people fight their
[1:46:41] way to hell
[1:46:43] they actively fight to go there
[1:46:46] i'd rather just give up and say lord
[1:46:48] jesus yeah i'll go to heaven thank you
[1:46:51] hallelujah
[1:46:53] amen so
[1:46:54] people get wha yo oh you're elitist no
[1:46:56] no i'm just i've just been called
[1:46:58] he found me i'm happy about that just
[1:47:01] meet the same god i know
[1:47:03] have the same experience i've had i
[1:47:05] don't see the word the same way fall in
[1:47:07] love with the same jesus walk with him
[1:47:09] the same you know love him the same and
[1:47:11] you'll come out the same just like peter
[1:47:13] said on the day of pentecost repent be
[1:47:15] baptized everyone in the name of jesus
[1:47:16] christ for remiss your sin and you shall
[1:47:18] receive the gift of the holy ghost the
[1:47:20] promises of you your children those are
[1:47:22] far off as many as the lord our god
[1:47:23] shall call and we should come the same
[1:47:25] way you'll get the same result
[1:47:27] hallelujah exactly
[1:47:29] amen
[1:47:31] it's a good result too
[1:47:33] it took the apostles to
[1:47:34] heaven it took the believers to heaven
[1:47:38] amen it's going to take me to heaven
[1:47:40] hallelujah so i just i just believe the
[1:47:42] same word we've been restored back to
[1:47:44] the original faith of the fathers
[1:47:46] and it still works
[1:47:48] hallelujah
[1:47:51] amen amen
[1:47:53] no so
[1:47:55] it's everything that see it's a seal of
[1:47:56] god's approval that everything that
[1:47:58] christ died for belongs to us it's god
[1:48:00] saying i've received you now and i'm
[1:48:02] going to give you the seal that you're
[1:48:03] just waiting for that time to our full
[1:48:06] redemption that which we have been
[1:48:08] partially already redeemed now the
[1:48:09] fullness our of our redemption is the
[1:48:11] adoption to with the redemption of our
[1:48:13] body
[1:48:14] that's the fullness of
[1:48:16] of it
[1:48:16] and we're looking for that day
[1:48:19] we're not in the millennium
[1:48:21] no this is very if this is the
[1:48:23] millennium i want another one
[1:48:26] i'm very disappointed
[1:48:28] yeah but some people think we're there
[1:48:30] but no we're not there we're here
[1:48:32] we're looking to go there
[1:48:34] hallelujah now
[1:48:37] let's go to now i feel like i've
[1:48:40] okay
[1:48:41] we're gonna go to
[1:48:43] now the main thing we're to go to samuel
[1:48:46] i was going to read this in the
[1:48:47] beginning i thought no we will
[1:48:49] i said i hope this works but then i
[1:48:51] didn't even read it so you're probably
[1:48:52] wondering what works now
[1:48:54] so in 2nd samuel chapter 6 now i love
[1:48:57] the life of david because david knew the
[1:48:59] main thing
[1:49:01] david knew the main thing
[1:49:04] amen he met the main thing when he was
[1:49:06] anointed by samuel
[1:49:08] the main thing is the lord the lord
[1:49:10] jesus right
[1:49:12] amen he knew the main thing and he could
[1:49:14] live such a life
[1:49:16] where the main thing was in charge of
[1:49:18] his life
[1:49:19] so because he knew the main thing he
[1:49:21] knew at god's appointed time he'll
[1:49:23] become king so he didn't try and kill
[1:49:25] saul though he had two opportunities
[1:49:27] amen he he committed his life to the
[1:49:29] lord
[1:49:30] because he knew the main thing
[1:49:32] even though he was king he wasn't really
[1:49:34] caught up in politics because he knew
[1:49:36] the main thing
[1:49:37] now
[1:49:38] david was an unusual character because
[1:49:40] he had such a hunger for god
[1:49:43] he saw god do many mighty things but he
[1:49:45] just he's like as the heart panic for
[1:49:47] the water broke so my soul longs after
[1:49:49] thee he said he you know he was an un
[1:49:51] you know unusual kind of character but
[1:49:53] he had such a burden he said he just
[1:49:54] wanted more of the lord now
[1:49:57] i love david because he can
[1:50:01] he can worship in such a way
[1:50:03] that it doesn't actually matter
[1:50:06] what's going on around him
[1:50:09] now
[1:50:11] this is second samuel 6 and 16. now
[1:50:13] we're just going to read this down to
[1:50:14] verse 22 and then we're just going to go
[1:50:16] into this a bit and sorry if it feels
[1:50:18] like i'm going to another thing but
[1:50:19] remember
[1:50:21] david knew the main thing
[1:50:23] and as the ark of the lord came into the
[1:50:25] city of david
[1:50:27] michael
[1:50:28] saul's daughter looked through the
[1:50:29] window and saw king david leaping and
[1:50:31] dancing before the lord and she despised
[1:50:33] him
[1:50:34] in her heart
[1:50:36] see it's amazing that
[1:50:37] two people can be in the same meeting
[1:50:39] they can hear the same music they can
[1:50:41] hear the same preaching they can see the
[1:50:43] same word carried by the same priests i
[1:50:46] mean they can actually be in the same
[1:50:47] church and they can see all this going
[1:50:49] on and they can have two very different
[1:50:51] outcomes
[1:50:52] because one is there rejoicing
[1:50:55] and one's despising
[1:50:57] i want to be in the rejoicing bracket
[1:50:58] don't you
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:00] amen and they brought in the ark of the
[1:51:02] lord and set it in his place in the
[1:51:04] midst of the tabernacle that david had
[1:51:06] pitched for it and david offered burnt
[1:51:08] offerings and peace offerings before the
[1:51:09] lord and as soon as david had made an
[1:51:12] end of of offering burnt offerings and
[1:51:14] peace offerings he blessed the people in
[1:51:16] the name of the lord of hosts and he
[1:51:18] dwelt among and he dealt among all the
[1:51:20] people even the whole multitude of
[1:51:22] israel as well to the
[1:51:25] women as men to everyone a cake of bread
[1:51:28] and a good piece of flesh and a flagon
[1:51:30] of wine so all the people departed
[1:51:32] everyone to his house then david
[1:51:34] returned to bless his household and
[1:51:37] michael the daughter of saul came out to
[1:51:39] meet david and he said how glorious was
[1:51:41] the king of israel today who uncovered
[1:51:44] himself today in the eyes of the
[1:51:45] handmaids of his servants as one of the
[1:51:48] vain fellow shamelessly uncovereth
[1:51:51] himself
[1:51:52] it's amazing were they in the same
[1:51:54] meeting
[1:51:55] they are in the same meeting
[1:51:58] now we're just going to stop there
[1:52:01] you know brother ram says that in the
[1:52:02] end time
[1:52:04] where the book of revelation he says
[1:52:07] exposes the works of the antichrist
[1:52:10] spirit
[1:52:11] or showing it rather that would come
[1:52:13] into the church and defile it making it
[1:52:15] lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:52:18] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:52:20] which are the attempted destruction of
[1:52:22] god's people and the discrediting of
[1:52:24] god's word right down to the time he's
[1:52:26] cast into the lake of fire he fights
[1:52:29] that he cannot stand it he knows if the
[1:52:30] people get the true revelation of the
[1:52:32] true church and what she is what she
[1:52:34] stands for
[1:52:35] and uh and that she can do the greater
[1:52:37] work she will be
[1:52:39] an invincible army
[1:52:41] hallelujah he says now
[1:52:42] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:52:44] spirits within the framework of the
[1:52:46] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:52:48] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:52:49] spirit satan will be powerless before
[1:52:52] her he will be definitely thought to
[1:52:53] today as when christ will stood as every
[1:52:55] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:52:57] desert yes satan hates revelation but we
[1:52:59] love it with true rival with true
[1:53:02] revelation in our lives the gates of
[1:53:03] hell cannot prevail against us but we
[1:53:05] cannot but we will prevail over them so
[1:53:08] i'm sure we can agree that one of the
[1:53:10] main things
[1:53:11] in this end time is stopping the
[1:53:14] antichrist spirit
[1:53:15] defiling the church remember whenever i
[1:53:18] read this i don't put it out oh that's
[1:53:20] ladies here i bring it in here i bring
[1:53:23] it in here
[1:53:26] so
[1:53:27] one of the main things in this time
[1:53:29] would be withstanding
[1:53:32] the antichrist spirit that it cannot
[1:53:34] come in and defile us
[1:53:37] making us lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:53:41] right
[1:53:42] what do we agree that's one of the main
[1:53:44] things
[1:53:45] now webster would say about formal
[1:53:48] formal means having the appearance
[1:53:50] without the substance
[1:53:52] characterized by
[1:53:54] punctualist respect for form or
[1:53:57] methodical
[1:53:59] so it becomes a methodical thing
[1:54:02] we sing this long we preach this long we
[1:54:05] pray this long we say god bless you this
[1:54:08] long we go home this long
[1:54:11] it becomes
[1:54:12] i'm not trying to make it a joke but
[1:54:13] this but
[1:54:15] it becomes methodical
[1:54:16] so it's not just oh the devil takes the
[1:54:18] word out of the church no you can have
[1:54:20] the word without the spirit and things
[1:54:22] could just become formal
[1:54:25] i'm just getting into the heart of
[1:54:26] michael right here
[1:54:28] because he david was out of order he
[1:54:30] wasn't conducting himself like a king
[1:54:32] that's not what kings do
[1:54:34] saul never did that none of the other
[1:54:36] nations kings i've you know read about
[1:54:38] you know they did that kind of dancing
[1:54:40] no and and he's meant to be our great
[1:54:42] savior here he's dancing around exposing
[1:54:44] himself
[1:54:46] this is a shame
[1:54:48] but you see she had that formal spirit
[1:54:50] on her
[1:54:52] remember she was israelite she was in
[1:54:54] the rural household
[1:54:56] you say raised up in church
[1:54:58] right she was right there
[1:55:00] but the problem is she was looking down
[1:55:02] looking up looking down in a
[1:55:03] condescending way
[1:55:05] but if she just got down to where
[1:55:06] david's level was
[1:55:08] hallelujah and saw what he saw i'm gonna
[1:55:11] get into that
[1:55:12] hey man then she would have been dancing
[1:55:14] too
[1:55:16] so it's following or according with
[1:55:18] established form custom or rule
[1:55:21] you know we're watching a um
[1:55:24] the girls love to watch weddings
[1:55:26] um message weddings from around the
[1:55:28] world
[1:55:28] and we watched well a part of one
[1:55:30] wedding is from trinidad
[1:55:32] and it took them 45 minutes at least
[1:55:34] just to get into the church
[1:55:37] now
[1:55:38] i've been at weddings i've conducted
[1:55:40] weddings nothing against them love them
[1:55:42] all but it's the kiwi way
[1:55:44] short sharp done
[1:55:47] you know i would have done like two or
[1:55:49] three weddings in that space where
[1:55:50] they're just coming in the church
[1:55:54] but it's because it's cut well you say
[1:55:56] well they take too long i could say this
[1:55:59] they make the most of the occasion
[1:56:01] because it's a big thing two people are
[1:56:03] getting married
[1:56:04] and it's not just anyone getting married
[1:56:06] as part of the bride getting married
[1:56:07] it's actually god expressing his plan of
[1:56:10] union and redemption
[1:56:12] and two people that's a big thing
[1:56:15] right so i mean to me now sure that's a
[1:56:18] long time but hey they make an occasion
[1:56:20] of it
[1:56:21] hallelujah
[1:56:22] but we just short sharp done so but you
[1:56:24] say well to them that's their custom
[1:56:27] and to us we have our custom but which
[1:56:29] one's right
[1:56:32] you know so but we don't want to be
[1:56:33] caught into a mold
[1:56:35] which is actually taking away from what
[1:56:37] god can do
[1:56:40] hallelujah amen now
[1:56:43] short wedding long wedding i'm not
[1:56:45] preaching a certain you got to be you
[1:56:46] know but what i'm saying is that we have
[1:56:49] a custom which is boom boom boom done
[1:56:51] and they have a custom which is you know
[1:56:52] let's make the most of the day
[1:56:54] let's celebrate this this is great you
[1:56:56] know
[1:56:58] but our short sharp doesn't mean that we
[1:56:59] don't celebrate it but you know they
[1:57:01] kind of express it a bit more
[1:57:03] anyway
[1:57:05] relating to
[1:57:06] or involving the outward form structure
[1:57:09] relationships or arrangements of
[1:57:10] elements rather than content
[1:57:13] what has that got to do with church well
[1:57:15] what is the content of a meeting
[1:57:18] god's the content
[1:57:20] jesus is the content
[1:57:21] hallelujah where it's not just the form
[1:57:23] and the structure you say well this
[1:57:25] church order yeah if the holy ghost is
[1:57:27] doing anything it'll be in order
[1:57:29] it won't be out of order
[1:57:30] you know
[1:57:31] and and and the thing of it is
[1:57:34] you say well there's a lot of carnality
[1:57:36] that you know that goes on when people
[1:57:37] shout and jump that may be so but
[1:57:39] there's the genuine in there too and if
[1:57:41] you clamp down on the whole thing you
[1:57:43] don't just squish the car or you squish
[1:57:44] the genuine
[1:57:47] right
[1:57:47] so
[1:57:49] i would rather some wildfire than no
[1:57:51] fire i'd rather people get out of order
[1:57:53] long enough to get saved
[1:57:55] and they haven't they have a moment in
[1:57:57] the presence of god that changed their
[1:57:58] life forever
[1:57:59] then then they can't break out of that
[1:58:01] because of a oh this is not what we do
[1:58:03] around here
[1:58:04] i don't want to limit god in any way
[1:58:07] john when he saw the book come open
[1:58:10] didn't sit there and say now that's a
[1:58:11] good thought that's right
[1:58:13] everything in heaven under the heavens
[1:58:15] everything heard him scream hallelujah
[1:58:16] said glory blessing honor be to the lamb
[1:58:19] now you may be quiet that's fine but as
[1:58:22] long as there's a revelation burning in
[1:58:23] your heart amen that you're part of the
[1:58:25] bride and jesus christ has redeemed you
[1:58:27] then let it burn on
[1:58:29] hallelujah but you know michael are here
[1:58:31] on foot now and david as well see see
[1:58:34] there's an idea that people become less
[1:58:37] emotional when they become more mature
[1:58:40] because we're matured
[1:58:41] now i just want you to know david
[1:58:44] david's in his life
[1:58:45] he's i just mr google told me that david
[1:58:49] was 30 years old when he danced before
[1:58:51] the ark
[1:58:52] now so he's not a little boy
[1:58:55] so physically he's come to his maturity
[1:58:58] but then also spiritually
[1:59:00] he's not just anointed and still a
[1:59:02] shepherd he's not anointed king but on
[1:59:04] the run he's not anointed and there's a
[1:59:06] civil war going on no the whole of
[1:59:09] israel has come together anointed him
[1:59:11] king so now he's come to his position in
[1:59:14] the body he's an adopted son of god
[1:59:18] in his position
[1:59:19] now that sounds like maturity to me
[1:59:22] hallelujah no he didn't become all
[1:59:24] formal because he matured no he he was
[1:59:27] dancing because god was doing something
[1:59:30] and he was rejoicing i mean because god
[1:59:32] was doing something in his day
[1:59:33] hallelujah so he was someone who was
[1:59:35] mature he was adopted into the body amen
[1:59:38] and he did not become cold formal and
[1:59:41] indifferent see see if the devil can't
[1:59:43] see if the devil can't make us lukewarm
[1:59:46] he'll make us formal
[1:59:48] right and if he can't do that he'll make
[1:59:50] us powerless
[1:59:51] all those things do tie together but you
[1:59:53] know we don't want to get so formal we
[1:59:55] become
[1:59:56] powerless we want we want to have it in
[1:59:59] such a way that god you know i just
[2:00:01] thinking camp can be every service
[2:00:03] no matter what's being preached you know
[2:00:05] there is such an expectation at camp on
[2:00:08] a sunday night
[2:00:09] that it could be possibly the worst
[2:00:11] sermon that's ever preached and god
[2:00:12] would still move in power
[2:00:14] it was tremendous by the way
[2:00:17] to me that was that was stellar that was
[2:00:18] awesome but you know what i'm saying is
[2:00:20] there's such an atmosphere and a hunger
[2:00:22] it's sunday night god's gonna do
[2:00:25] something lord i want to touch the hem
[2:00:26] of your gum and this is my time
[2:00:28] holy we're going to have that time all
[2:00:30] the time
[2:00:31] hello where god could minister something
[2:00:33] it may be manifest in a different way
[2:00:35] but he could touch your heart
[2:00:37] change your life
[2:00:39] those are the moments i want however it
[2:00:41] is displayed praise god but as long as
[2:00:42] he comes and touches my heart
[2:00:44] amen changes me in a bit hallelujah
[2:00:47] that's what i want amen so see the thing
[2:00:49] is a lot of people actually they've just
[2:00:51] allowed the devil to rob them of their
[2:00:53] joy
[2:00:54] so michael was in that kind of she was
[2:00:56] in that kind of a
[2:00:58] a a state she was in the same meeting as
[2:01:00] david she saw the same arc being carried
[2:01:02] in as david she heard the same music as
[2:01:03] david she's she heard the same preaching
[2:01:06] as david she was in the same church as
[2:01:07] david but yet she was despising
[2:01:11] him
[2:01:11] in her heart
[2:01:13] now
[2:01:15] but david
[2:01:17] see the devil always try and knock you
[2:01:19] after god's done something for you
[2:01:21] he will always try and knock you down
[2:01:23] because he tries to make you doubt what
[2:01:25] happened
[2:01:27] right
[2:01:28] but the thing is david david was a man
[2:01:31] after god's own heart see we're going to
[2:01:33] face opposition
[2:01:35] was that really real did that really
[2:01:36] happen was that really for you well and
[2:01:39] you go look back at the recording and
[2:01:40] the recording's not the same as being
[2:01:42] there
[2:01:43] that's just how it is
[2:01:44] you know but it really did happen it
[2:01:46] really was there and you yeah god really
[2:01:48] did something but then david would say
[2:01:51] can can we just go up to the
[2:01:53] go up to second samuel 6 and 21.
[2:01:57] hallelujah so so here's michael she said
[2:01:59] you know you made a shame in all these
[2:02:01] things but now notice david
[2:02:03] and david said unto michael it was
[2:02:06] before the lord so you're all of us
[2:02:08] dancing it was before the lord
[2:02:10] which chose me before thy father and
[2:02:13] before all his house to appoint me ruler
[2:02:15] over the people of the lord over israel
[2:02:18] therefore will i play before the lord so
[2:02:20] he was dancing because god chose him
[2:02:23] i mean god had elected him god had
[2:02:25] anointed him to be king it wasn't him
[2:02:27] choosing and him deciding now he began
[2:02:29] to dance because god chose me i'm
[2:02:32] accepted in the beloved i've been
[2:02:33] redeemed i've been washing the blood of
[2:02:35] the lamb amen this is my moment this is
[2:02:37] my hour amen i had a desire for god and
[2:02:40] god gave me the desire of my heart
[2:02:42] because the ark is coming into the
[2:02:43] setting the word is being restored back
[2:02:45] into my life hallelujah because god
[2:02:48] chose me that's why i can rejoice i
[2:02:50] didn't choose me he chose me i mean if
[2:02:53] he chose me that's all that matters
[2:02:56] hallelujah and this is that's why i
[2:02:58] worship god i mean that's why i dance
[2:03:00] before the lord because he has chosen me
[2:03:04] hallelujah it should be the same way
[2:03:05] with you and i why do we worship why are
[2:03:08] we believers because he has chosen me
[2:03:10] before the foundation of the world
[2:03:12] before there's anything he thought of me
[2:03:13] in the back part of his mind so i'm
[2:03:15] going to have them in 2021. they're the
[2:03:18] apple of mine eye i'm going to make a
[2:03:20] way before that devil ever comes into
[2:03:22] existence the lamb's blood is going to
[2:03:23] be slain before the foundation of the
[2:03:24] world i'm going to make a way for them
[2:03:26] to be redeemed they meant to be made
[2:03:28] whole only to conquer every effort that
[2:03:30] he has over them
[2:03:32] hallelujah
[2:03:34] amen he chose me
[2:03:36] harley why do you get happy he chose me
[2:03:39] god is sovereign he no one can bend his
[2:03:42] mind it's not a democracy in heaven he
[2:03:44] said i've just chose to buy for
[2:03:46] knowledge he looked through the strands
[2:03:48] of time he saw me in the condition i
[2:03:50] asked him that i'd accept him
[2:03:52] he's not going to predestinate that one
[2:03:54] i'm going to put a c gene a
[2:03:55] predestination in their soul doesn't
[2:03:57] matter what concrete's poured over them
[2:03:59] whatever troubles they face in life
[2:04:01] whatever things they go through i mean
[2:04:03] they're gonna come out as gold in the
[2:04:04] end and because i have chosen them
[2:04:06] before the foundation of the world
[2:04:08] hallelujah
[2:04:10] hallelujah
[2:04:11] god has chosen me to be part of the
[2:04:13] bride be part of his word that's why i
[2:04:15] dance before the lord amen he's chosen
[2:04:18] me to take a rapture i mean that's why i
[2:04:20] danced before the lord and he's chosen
[2:04:22] me that this body is going to be changed
[2:04:24] oh that's why i dance before the lord
[2:04:26] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen he's
[2:04:29] chosen me to overcome that's why i
[2:04:31] worship hallelujah he has chosen me amen
[2:04:34] that i will not taste death but i'm
[2:04:36] going to go in a body change amen when
[2:04:39] he said to him that overcometh they will

[2:04:42] my father's throne amen he chose me to
[2:04:45] be that overcomer you know we have a
[2:04:47] position amen that he has ordained for
[2:04:49] you and i to sit in and that is not to
[2:04:51] be the devil's whipping boy but there's
[2:04:53] a sit as an overcomer on the throne of
[2:04:55] god hallelujah that's why david said i i
[2:04:59] do did this before the lord he wasn't
[2:05:01] looking to be a he didn't care what
[2:05:03] others thought
[2:05:05] hallelujah he worshipped god because god
[2:05:07] was god and that's how we should be in
[2:05:09] every situation though trouble may
[2:05:11] surround us though the world is falling
[2:05:14] apart though there's everyone's desire
[2:05:16] divided every which way and opinions and
[2:05:18] social media and everyone says this and
[2:05:20] that god's word stands true
[2:05:23] amen and god is here he's risen in this
[2:05:26] day yeah the mighty angel has descended
[2:05:29] christ himself to anoint to dwell in a
[2:05:31] people amen that he will prepare us to
