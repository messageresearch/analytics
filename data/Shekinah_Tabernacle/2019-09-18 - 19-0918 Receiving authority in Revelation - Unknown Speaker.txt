brother Isaac the way like I just said no and brother our month and always brace on his but always ready I don't know how how they do it I don't know how they I'm very happy to stand the other back very very complete to come to this front every time it's just nerve-racking but that means that the Lord needs to take control otherwise shambles so I place it in the Lord's and I'm a surrendered vessel and that's why they can stand here if we can open up tonight our Bibles and we'll look at Luke 10 from verse 6:17 it was 20 who's had a good day to Wednesday I'm at this point I've I've told brother been quite a few times I really want to have a I want to have a Sunday on Monday I want to have this video I want to have love I want to have that victory on a Monday and I know I have it I know I have it but I want to step into that job there IRD and I want to I want to just rejoice I just want to have a good old time and that's coming that's coming I'm praying for that Laurie and I hope you can walk into your job and just praise the Lord this song really struck me now bless the Lord O my soul I was I was looking at he's talking about his soul they say come on bless the Lord bless the Lord no now Oh everything I have my soul amen that that affectionate love that agape Lord I just want to bless him and the deepest part of me amen oh my soul and I was wonderful Luke 17 I saw in Luke 10 verse 17 and the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven now here's them he is his day here's the punchline behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents listen carefully and scorpions and over some the power of the enemy does is that how it reads in your Bible not okay let's try that again and over mostly the power not almost just a tiny but 99% over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice nots he warns us that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are way written and I'll just if we can quickly go to proverbs proverbs 29 proverbs 29 verse verse 2 proverbs 29 verse 2 here we go say many of you there are wonderful technicians at the back of quicker than you listening god bless them when the righteous are in authority so in the torah it actually reads when the righteous are in increase the people rejoice but when the wicked birth through the people mourn you may have your seats tonight god bless the reading of his word god is good all the time yeah so are we read this Matthew seven we thought okay so brother Caleb Matthew 7 verse 24 therefore whosoever hear these things of mine and doeth them I will liken them and to a wise man which built his house upon a rock you're very familiar with this and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and fell not but it was founded upon a rock amen and everyone that hear these things of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon what I'm sand who's been at the ocean who's been on the beach I love the beach love the beach you stand still for the sport in stem quiet and the waves come and the waves come and just he was like oh you beat up going and then you started doing this whole balancing act how long can I stand still for and then eventually it'll just fall you know it's just shaky it's just a key there's nothing nothing solid below you and and great was the fall of the year or so and the floods came and the winds blew beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings I was I love this but people were astonished at his doctrine or he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes oh my oh my and what authority does he come and what authority and that's my little theme for tonight I'm bringing you absolutely nothing new right I love to find little nuggets from preachers and from this this pulpit here bunch of them and a nugget that my book I don't know in the Kiwi language and nugget for me is solid gold right gold I wanted to go and look at what the gold price today for I don't know 900 bucks I don't know I don't know what it is significant right and that's what I see in a nugget I don't see in in car terms maybe you would know brother James and nugget is you don't want to buy a nugget nugget is like $300 Honda not Isaac but it's a Honda so you make it back say we've got all the faith but now we'll pray we pray till he gets here right Authority so my mind a little theme here is a receiving authority through revelation right and that's exactly how I received it so I'm exactly I'm preaching for me I'm not preaching for anyone else praise the Lord because he was just giving me all this nuggets and I'm just putting it together and a few sometimes like I'm putting you know pulling some of the strings and getting that foot Cindy and I mean during all this all the messages has come from this book but you know last Wednesday was was brother Ben and he preached of on spiritual authority now unlike brother Bing I take two months to prepare one message and he you know I can just pluck it out of the air and and he sees oh I think Brett's is a Christine you asked him what's the theme last last window and he goes our spiritual authority I said sorry what no I showed him on my phone you know I've been preparing for this so the Lord the Lord's funny the Lord you know no he's got a sense of humor bath he's got a message for you in this hour the time is short time is now so two ears one mouth listen twice all right to forgive me if you have heard some of this before the next thing you probably have heard the definition of authority power to influence in command thought opinion all behavior freedom granted by one in authority persons in command specifically government local authority local authorities when we talk about the but about the police you know the local authorities you know the government that the the regional councils or they empower that they the source from which the citation is drawn so he quoted extensively from the Bible his sole authority conclusive statement or set of statements a decision taken as a president and the last thing testimony there's a lot of Thor identities to me no one can change your DNA you don't change your and then I love authority and power slightly different things to different things Barrow is the force by which one you can oblige others or to obey you Authority is the right to direct and command to be listened to or obeyed others obey made by others Authority requests power power without Authority is tyranny I want to stop there quickly and brother basil was here with his testimony and I was streaming in I was richly blessed by that and he had his this them anyway we hit his little is there's this little child back in South Africa but there's big old youth and some of you were here with my very first message and you remember what was that title thanks mr. Brahn among cancer thanks kick on answer it was the miracle before the miracle okay and that jumped out to me that jumped out to me saying wait a minute the miracle is that boy nothing wrong with it okay praise the Lord but wait a minute step 1 bang you find yourself and I'm trying to color this in as much as I can in a short time as I can you are in a third world you are surrounded by death around every corner they are merciless do anything wrong any any slight movement don't put in your indicator and go into their Lane it is it is tense it is real people want to fight people you know what I'm talking about there's America there's Africa there's this not only one country that that experiences this right so brother basil is on his knees day in the middle of nowhere was this like I didn't hear the the town was it okay so I thought was you know Joburg ish yeah I don't want to have you in that situation ever but try and picture this this is surrounded by hundreds of probably thousands of people this is this is stir something significant this happen out of the one of the people and one of them it's always us versus them as always it's never unity and he's there on his knees eyes closed amongst all this and he's praised his Lord I don't know I I don't know I can't he opens his eyes and these his brothers stop just thee sorry hello way how can this come about and this isn't what I want to tie in here they were holding back thousands of people I don't know how many brothers were there how many sisters they were holding back in authority they had power and authority and they were holding that back they were not forcing it maybe they were pushing right Jesus there was a multitude of people that was pushing in the crowds right and we'll get to that one story right now but there was Authority it was legions of angels okay like like that servant just Lord open his eyes somebody see it is it is significant to do to to see the whole picture yes the boy made it without a scratch hallelujah that's a healing God we're talking about but there was a trial he had to walk into that yes his faith was tested to the maximum for me it would have been my maximum I said lord I cannot do this I don't know what to do the fear that you would have in that situation but when he opened his eyes and saw brother Oh what what confidence what what peace and love he would have received that that's so I hope you catch that I hope and brother basil I hope I do their justice because it granted me I was in that situation it's easy for some of our brothers to step into that situation if you've been there and that was just significant so please linger on that thought and I think one of one of the things what and I don't know who said this is all old saying say you can say you can't either way you right I think he was on his knees then he was saying I can through Christ because I you have the authority it's promised to us you can't do this all by yourself if you identify that you are thee now I want to talk and this is actually where I grab my theme from is is the moon I've listened to some of the sermons of the brothers in in in the states around the the Ministry of the moon and the authority the moon holds over that holding back the waters okay I quickly pulled some some quotes and some some not quite it's just how the how the worlds you know in the website is called space calm easy to remember the moon is the easiest celestial object to find in the sky when it's the Earth's only natural satellite hovers above us right and round until it seemingly disappears for a few nights the rhythm of the moon's phases has guided humanity for millennia for instance calendar months are roughly equal to the time takes to go from one full moon to the next this is quite interesting moon phases and the moon's orbit are mysteries to many for example the moon always shows us the same face that happens because it takes to 27.3 days both to rotate on its axis and to orbit there's something significant that then does and that number and and I'll try and find that if you can please have the Liberty we see either the moon or full half moon or no moon or new moon because the moon reflects sunlight how much of it we see depends on the moon's position in relation to the earth and the Sun and I put in brackets s Oh amen the moon is a bit more than 1/4 so 1/4 the size of Earth a much smaller ratio than any other planets and the moon so it's insignificant in size ok if you take a whole solar system what's the moon right this means the moon has a great effect on the planet and very possibly and this is I didn't make this up very possibly is what makes life on Earth possible directly quoted from space.com now coming back to my theme of authority how'd he get Authority how do you get the power pray without ceasing one of the things pray without ceasing another another thing that grabbed me or struck me we were talking about brother a month about this whole pray without ceasing and I was saying what what he sees in that and and only recently I thought of and again this is that this is all the Nuggets I grab from all the other sermons someone talked about repetitive free it could have been proud of that my brother branham I'm not sure saying that and I want to open it an example here so like one of my sons would not name the name we'll ask one thing tomorrow the next day we'll ask something else the next time was that his never got his mind fixed on something okay there's no balance so me as a parent I'm sitting there and say okay let's take an example I want to I want to motocross or motorbike helmet because I'm gonna be a motocross champion and you go yep okay I'm listening so how much does it cost did you do all that some ease and let him think about it let him you know whatever next week he comes or now I need to be a mix i need to be an exit so i needed me in excel m't i need the meat better than I did today and and the colorful gold plated B mix cuz I'm gonna be BMX champions I'm listening but me as a parent I haven't responded so are you now a melted motorbike or are you be a mixture so I didn't go and buy that motive like I know better okay I've got some wisdom because I know now I know my child okay I know the other one as well and if he's made his mind up you can bet your bottom dollar and we don't beat so we guarantee I guarantee my bottom dollar right that he's made up his mind he thinks about it he's got a thought process I I need that I want that I need that than I and I'm gonna save up for that and I and I leave that as well because I know my child he's going to save up it'll get the cash he'll come to me said dad I'm gonna buy that yes let's go the other one I give a bit of freedom in his thoughts together that and say what do you really want what do you need maybe I need to persuade him a bit then massages is his thoughts of it right now with that I want to get back to pray without ceasing if I pray today Lord and this and there's a lot of changes happening now around us and now in our little church you know people that need to move and people that's coming and going and you know we've got people up in the air and people out in this South Island and people this building how there's a lot that happened so we need to you need to get on your knees and you pray you pray for healing you pray for and and let's take an example we will pray for four sisters Christine's ankle right but we won't break tonight and that's it right let's repeat that trick but we repeat it not out of routine what out of love out of authority out of I've seen the testimony I've been in that situation of healing where I receive that I will pray until we receive that okay that for me is the pray without ceasing it doesn't need to be a new pray every day but pray pray and pray some more now brother Isaac touched on this and I'll quickly quickly glance over that again and again there touched me and you will know exactly which Suman I was I'm talking about there was there was magnificent to me ye are God's objects of worship look up to look upon watch what we do people looking into our lives at our lives other Christians looking at us message people brothers and sisters looking at our lives but we will flick what's the authority that we approach something I want you to think about that I've got a quick quote here actually to from brother Branham from that time it's a sermon his name he's a great contractor before he ever had a human being on earth he laid out the material like a contractor building his subdivision but the James even know about this of Marv - it was he was going to make man in his own image and give them earth to stay they were lesser gods than he was jesus said your laws say that you are gods that's the minion kings dominion over the earth he could do anything he wanted to and sin come in and our women brings child and what when he does that child must die it's exactly it's perverted birth and then when the new birth comes in it corrects that perverted birth and gives it eternal life through the Father Jesus Christ oh brother jesus said he that heareth my word he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life he I will raise him up again in that last day amen all the father has given me will come to me nothing is lost he'll raise her up again in the last day death or nothing else can separate us in the statue of a perfect man but you've got genuine faith genuine virtue genuine knowledge genuine temperance genuine patience that's something to strive for we are pleading day and night lord give me wisdom give me patience give me that godliness that love I'll get to that now see you're moving up right now in the Newland line all right firstly add godliness oh my god leanness to be added what does godliness mean I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't find even even find what it mean finally I was then down at brother Jeffrey's here we found it in the dictionary godliness means to be like God after you've got faith virtue knowledge temperance patience then be like God you say I can't do that brother Brennan I can't do that by the end yes you can let me just read you a few other scriptures Matthew 5 verse 48 Matthew 5 verse 48 and see if you're supposed to be like God you know the Bible says to hear God's either see so why all the things that's in God is in you Matthew 5:48 be ye perfect be ye therefore perfect what is that what is the fiction even as your father in heaven is perfect you're not argue that and I've heard this now recently you are little and I think I pronounced it right MSE i'ts you know messiahs little Messiah Christ in you the hope of glory and we're not living back in nineteen seventy sixty five we're all grown up now now all of a sudden we mature Christians okay and what the maturity is coming all these fruits of the spirit with this maturity we understand the authority and the power that we can we can speak that can come over our tongue and that's why he's the author and finisher of our faith author meaning authority bringing authority and that's why I personally me I want to be able to stand here just like our beloved brother branham didn't say you know I am waiting for him to come I'm waiting for him to come and that's why I love about our preachers you hear them jokingly referring to they've visited some place and then the Brotherhood that they are visiting that place and say oh you can take the Sunday sermon I would think I'll be able to do that I can't walk into that now they just think it why cuz they've they've got this whole surrendered heart they come in confidence because they've seen God coming onto the scene they've seen the full surrender in their lives and they will receive that authority as as simple as that they are talking from victory they've had the victory met they can come there because God is with it now I want to give you a bit of history and from the Bible I'm going to tell you about something recent in terms of brother branham's time and something now to make it more rebel irrelevant for the young ones were the people that can't place themselves and don't have that imagination to do to illustrate the whole scene in the Bible or maybe in brother branham's days give you something relevant now that that shows Authority and shows it in action and shows that Caleb taking his claiming his mountain in today's terms now the one in history I am talking about how could Caleb claim his mountain that God gave him his Mountain that is not a cry for victory but that is from victory the Lord said that's your Mountain you can stand on this side and say okay that's my Mountain but gave you mountain Jacob wrestling with the angel wrestling not letting go saying I want my blessing not letting go right without ceasing don't stop praying don't let go amen now I want to try and illustrate like I did with brother Brad dazzle I'm going to quickly illustrate this were you happy with time but the Brenham and the blind woman in Arkansas 16 7 years 17 years old and I purposely didn't write anything down there because I want to have this in my minor try and get it over my lips she was blind it was raining brother Brandon was trying to I think get into his car something after service all the busses lining up now I'm imagining thousands of people I'm back in nineteen fifty 54 whenever that was preached that's that service it was a normal service it was not a pray a healing service or anything as I understand it and these people were going home now and buses back then it was segregation okay and what was it the Jimmy Jim Crow law is it the Jim Crow law so no ice no blacks no touching no helping no nothing right and this is a little black blind girl yelling out for her dad she lost the dad she's blind she's been blind since she was 12 brother branham years that sees that this is the Holy Spirit we talking about thousands of people and he's hearing her her voice that's not the only voice could yourself they yeah he gets in her way because she's running now she's feeling she's coming through the crowd and she bumps into and she's sorry man can I help you yes I'm looking for my dad we're from Mississippi or Missouri he sees the Missouri bus okay I can guide are they but the Holy Spirit what is what why are you here are you blind yes I've been blind since I was 12 we wanted to come here we get to get the healer to to be on the stage with the healer to touch the healer right now while this is going on the Jim Crow law didn't stop just instantly okay his people wanted to get him away to separate them okay that is not Authority that is power that is just something that's forced upon that's tyranny okay and here they meet and he said I don't care about this law yeah I follow the Holy Spirit okay and they talk and it's like okay I can't remember all the detail but then he said what have I tell you I'm brother Brennan and she grabs me she cannot was your face it and she grabs his face thank you she doesn't let go brother Brennan wants to grab a hand to get the discernment to make her see she doesn't want to let go I'm not letting go she had him on his lapel and on his face she was not letting go and she received it so you receive this I am she said to him if you take me to this and just before he said brother branham I'm brother Brennan just before that she said you take me to the healer and I'll find my daddy myself authority fight power coming into that position that's perfectly okay so now you want something recently brother brother Isaac you're not here so now I can skim that on you like you did with brother out of months playback all he did oh and this is this is this is the extent of it all I heard was the neighbors next door need to move out that's it neighbors next door we now need to move out I don't see a car next door yes they come and go we've got sister Joe moving in and there's a few movements and there's a few changes happening but the neighbors next door need to move out that is it that's it we've prayed for them he prayed that there's movement but one little rock or people fall off the mountain is that lawyer that Devils going to tell you now the mountain hasn't moved is there one little people that fall it fell off that mountain yes this movement and that's the example people building their houses trials they come they go and all this kind of thing but don't give up on your first trial in creatin get that faith get that authority man speak from me and pray without ceasing yes we are going through a lot of change now and this this this was a lovely quote from the Bible maybe you could put that up brother Caleb that is Luke 12 verse 32 look Luke 12 verse 32 fear not little flock or it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom so that you have give alms provide yourselves bags with wax that won't go cold a treasure in the heavens that faileth not well no thief a thief approaches neither moth ha well where your treasure is there your heart horse it means that your loins be good at about your lights burning and you yourself like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open until and to him immediately we might be a little flock in 1 1 3 George but don't think we are little light we are shining bright until I die I'm asking you this rhetorical question how can we rule with authority without him inside of me in you preparing your heart before that twinkling of an eye moment what do people see when they see you my example and I'm about to close what I wanted to say is a small example and again relevant if we walk through that or we find kids we find the kitchen normal little kitchen little basin bridge good glasses if you walk in this Sunday morning 9 o'clock what is it it's a war room amen there is fire and there's authority and this power and perfect faith that meets in that room and that flows on into this and prepare their hearts and prepare this this congregation for something big to come and I'm seeing that every Sunday and that's why once you have that example people would see you would look at you you might see brother ben not just on the sunday but have you seen him on a friday with his little t-shirt than his tracksuit pants you know looks like this man doesn't have an authority don't be fooled about that you can walk past that kitchen and looks like a kitchen that's a war room that's a warrior pray bless you brother meaning and then I want you to quickly end with this that if the difference to divine love the difference of this world and us is arguably and this is something that's recent to me and relevant I think is a massive revelation the difference between this world out there and us in here is arguably just understanding the true definition of love one of the most perverted things probably along side with music is love the understanding of love in the message of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever did he ever see people you love to be around and I can genuinely say when I come here Wednesdays and Sundays Sundays I do not want to leave that's me my wife is just tugging me tug michi also don't want to leave but cheese the wise one in this relationship right I don't want to care about anything else just love to be around them because they create an atmosphere a heavenly one and you like to be around them others seem to be good people but you just had you just have to get her away once in a while you know get along with him you know what I mean and yet they seem to be good people that's not creative a man was made to be a God you know that Genesis 1 when he sees he has dominion dumain over the whole earth and he was made to be an amateur God and now he receives God he can become son of God he was made in the image God at hands got it feet and so forth therefore a man was made like him it was an amateur God but sin has blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart bless the Lord O my soul bless it listen why why well I'm this way I'm that way you'll never get anywhere with God there but your heart your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about you cause down reasoning so you must be positive that brothers positive oh my goodness Oh for them poor smile only style that is positive yes just beautiful to see and you stay

gallivanting and I came home and I was in my bag getting the key and all that kind of thing now I know where the key is in the bottom of the of the bag it's one of the annoying things I need to get out because everything needs to come out to get to the key so I thought I can shortcut I'm here and then and there and okay I feel the key feel the key I rub something I think what's that like a slippy like a receipt from a thing I bought or whatever but I just chuck it back in and open the door went into the house today this morning when I when I got to work actually just before I got to work I was standing and waiting for my carpool I got out the I was packing my life that's right back in my lunch now I need to put everything back into order I check out the slippy authority I didn't want to check it away like whoa that's small writing and adorned and me like brother Ben was with his with his Bible that was that was a way that was you know couldn't find it my dad gave me a little Gideon's Bible just the New Testament in Psalms and I and I ripped the page from there and I thought Lord what have I done this is it's not nice what does this mishit I need to get from this why would I I'm not like this why did I have to rip that oh how can I open that book and that small compartment and rip a page what is slowly putting the page together there's no not enough light so I left it and I was sad I was really really honestly sad and I came to work and I looked at where the page that was ripped out and this was so my first scripture today was Luke 10 this was Luke 8 and 9 that page before well I have to read this I have to what what is it the law trying to tell me here and behold they came a man named yah it is said this is verse 41 and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house we had only one daughter about twelve years of age and she lay in a dying and then this is quite a rough but as he went the people thronged him and that's where the story stopped I thought what is why and a woman having an issue with blood twelve years which has spent all a living upon us that physicians neither could be healed of any pain behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stones and Jesus said and now you know the story who touched me and Jesus said somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me and it carries on and when that woman saw that she has not hid she came trembling falling down before him she declared unto Him before all the people for what for she has touched him how she was healed immediately now this struck me and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort I went into the court and the concordance who got here is the is the Greek word I think and it comes from female child it comes from a descendent he was identifying her with him he sang daughter she had authority that she had faith and authority who touch that garment to know something will happen if I can only touch His garment just before that that that man was his only child where is he gone what's happened be right without ceasing she went through that
