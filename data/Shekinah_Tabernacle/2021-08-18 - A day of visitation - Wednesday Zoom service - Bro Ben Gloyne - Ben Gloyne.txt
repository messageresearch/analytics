back in this position again it feels like we've gone back in time um yeah god bless you all now we're just gonna turn to acts chapter two i've got a couple of places to read from the book of acts one is is acts chapter two and we're gonna read from verse uh verses uh verse one um praise the lord and god bless you all in youtube land wherever you may be trust the lord is with you this night now yeah so we're acts chapter two we're gonna read from verse one we're gonna read down to verse 13 and then we're going to go to acts chapter 10. so acts 2 and 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it set upon each of them and they were filled or they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in his own tongue when we were born corinthians and medes and elamites and dwellers in mesopotamia and in judea and cappadisia and pontius and asia figure and pamphlet in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of god and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meanest this others mocking said these men are full of new wine i mean we're just going to go to acts chapter 10 and we are going to read from verse 1 as well i mean so it says here there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band a devout man and one that fed god with all this house which gave much arms to the people and prayed to god always he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god come to him and saying unto him cornelius and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thy arms that come up from memorial before god and now send me to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter he lodges with one simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside he shall tell thee what thou ought us to do amen may the lord bless the reading of his word let's just bow heads in a word of prayer gracious heavenly father we want to thank you dear god that though this lockdown may be going on we're so glad your word is not bound lord jesus we thank you that you are with us you said you never leave us nor forsake us so just pray is i just want to ask dear god that you would come and you would anoint speaker and hearer want to thank you that distance is nothing to you so father i pray you'd be the same god here as you would be in otaki your lord and param or akitaro or uppahat or lord lord lord jesus christ wherever we gather dear god i pray you'll be very present and real to us all dear garbo feel your presence and i pray you are not your word to our hearts and we love you we just want to commit out our time lord commit this time into your hands and commit the service lord may take it under your divine control for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight and i would like to if i could title this i'd like to talk about a day of visitation now we read here of cornelius we read their first in the book of acts of the of the uh day of pentecost uh it says that they are all gathered there in the upper room and and it said now when the prince of lord fill that house it filled them and then they were you know you know when it was noised abroad all the people they saw the manifestation of it uh and they thought maybe you know these people are drunk with new wine but the thing is the those in the upper room they are prepared for a visitation and it's got to be the same thing with you and i you know even in this time where it feels is you know as i said before it feels like we've kind of gone back around and time again and we're back where we had an original lockdown but you know god is still god and um i just want to encourage you tonight you know we need to be prepared for a visitation of the lord you know we gather together even we are you know part of why we're believers you know we should expect god to visit us amen we should expect angels to visit our house and we know it will be a true angel of the lord because it always point us back into the word but here we have this man cornelius where god would describe him as a as a devout man a man who would you know a man who feared god and with all this house gave much arms to the people and prayed to god always now here is god god was preparing cornelius because god was going to open the door to the gentiles where you know the day of pentecost yo god filled was mainly a jewish church then we know peter i mean i mean philip in acts chapter eight he went to preach to the samaritans which are the half jew and gentile but then we know that the the the gospel was going to go to every creature so i was going to go to the gentiles as well so here was god was preparing a man for a visitation now cornelius he didn't really know well he had no idea this was going to happen to him i you know maybe he would pray this time every day being a devout man you know but god would god would send his angel there because god was going to use cornelius in his household as the first part of the gentile bride in that age now if we look at the character of the man now i want to talk about preparing for a visitation amen because we want to prepare for a visitation don't we you know we want to you know i pray that we desire that god would come visit us in our homes where we are that even though we are a part yet we are you know god is with us and you know we can expect god to move in our homes can we not you know it's not just in the four walls of church where god lives you know it's not just you know when we're gathered in a prayer meeting but you know it's where you know it's it's it's he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us so we should expect god to come and fill our houses and fill our beings and take over our prayer lives and take over our lives and come and fill us you know time and time again you know that should be our hearts desire and it should be our expectation because our god is a supernatural god you know we can't expect our children just to come in just by conforming to the message you know and becoming good message believers you know the only way that they can really get saved is god meets them you know god fills him with the holy ghost god the goodness of god leads them to repentance that's you know that's that's what we need can we all have an amen or a hand away you know who's with me who wants a visitation of the lord you know you can have an angel visit your house yeah we know that the visitation of angels didn't stop after the book of acts was finished being written but you know angels still visit god's children even today amen so this word uh devout here in the greek speaking of cornelius notice when luke is inspired to write the book of acts it's the holy ghost through through lucas recording the acts of the holy ghost of that age that he would describe cornelius as a devout man now it doesn't say how rich he was how big his house was you know any of those things but he was devout now to me this is this is speaking of the condition of his heart where you know this word devout or rather this you know devout means he's very consecrated to the lord but he's one that feared god now this this fearing god isn't one who's terrified of god but it's one that stands in aurov or or one that reverences and to have reverence means have deep respect so he was he was an or of the god that had become his god he was a gentile he was a proselyte to the jewish religion but but he he had a real or whatever maybe someone would speak of you know jehovah or adonai or el shaddai or you know one of the titles of god from the old testament you know he'd have real awe in his heart about how great is our god and how merciful he is and you know because he's the creator of heavens and earth and he was one who who would pray all way the scripture would say so this is this is how god is is recording of this gentile now i want to just say that when i talk about he was a devout man and he any and he prayed all way and you know please don't get in your mind that it's your good works that will cause god to come upon the scene but it's a condition of a believer's heart and the desire that we have will bring him on the scene so you know the scripture would tell us in first thessalonians 5 the apostle paul tells the believers to rejoice ever more this is from verse 16. pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of god can uh in christ jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophet prophesying prove all things hold fast to that which is good and abstain from all appearance of evil so when it talks about praying all way that doesn't i mean pray without ceasing that doesn't mean that we should be on our knees 24 7 but you know we should be praying in our hearts of the lord as as a scripture would say in ephesians we should sing spiritual songs and so psalms in our heart unto the lord who's with me tonight amen we should have a we should have a um atmosphere around us you know where the lord feels welcome to draw near you know with all my heart i want god to walk with me right i don't just want to have a head knowledge of the lord jesus my desire is that god would live with me right that's why he died on calvary to break any distance between us and god you know that he and man would become one so you and him would become one where he would dwell in you by the holy ghost amen his very own spirit his own life will come and dwell in the believer and you know it's really what we talk about what we fellowship on can bring god close or can grieve him away you know we can grieve the lord away by by gossip and backbiting and and political uh talk you know in the church and what i mean by political talk is you know you talk good you know bad about someone talk good about someone else and you know in order to to change people's perception in a you know the human way but you know we don't want to belittle one another or you know the lord is grieved by that i believe he's not pleased when we when we murder each other's reputation you know we don't want to you know fall into that kind of bracket but but talking about the law brings them close and that's what i really want to um talk about just for next few moments you know the two on the way to emmaus in luke chapter 24. now when brother branham he preaches two messages at the end of his ministry one is uh uh and they're both called mon events to make clear by prophecy now who's heard that one right so he goes to luke chapter 24 and he he he he reads the scripture from the two on the way to emmaus and he is going to preach from that and and he's going to say the condition that the people were in just after the resurrection there is is these monuments you see around us made clear by luke chapter 24 which is a prophecy right so so luke 24 is a prophecy and it's actually making the day we live in clear this is a very great uh confusing time isn't it for the world you know everyone has an opinion everyone says lots of things about pretty much everything and you know but but but the but the lord seemed to vindicate a prophet to the earth on this day to tell us that these modern events 2021 are made clear by luke chapter 24. now for the believer it is very clear because the whole purpose of the lord walking with the two on the way to emmaus is that he would open the scripture to them of all the prophecies that he had just fulfilled in their day and then he went with them into the house and he did something he did before he was crucified which he took the bread and he broke it and the scripture says when he did that and he handed it to the disciples their eyes came open and they realized that it was the lord had you know he had raised he has risen from the dead and then they said did not our hearts burn within us as he you know as we spoke along the way so he spent about six hours from when he started walking with them and they they were sad you know but the thing is they were talking about what the lord had done in their day and talking about what the lord had done in the day drew him near and that's what we want is it not we want the lord to draw near you know there'll be more than stories or more than just doctrine yeah but the lord himself would draw near and actually enter into our conversation and begin to guide us into the scripture so there he was you know maybe caught yeah you know maybe cleopas or maybe you know yours friend you know they would begin to relate of maybe maybe they related when the disciples were on the sea of galilee you know and the storm was there and ten thousand devils got in that storm and swore they'd drown the disciples you know and jesus and um you know the disciples they were going to drown and they wake up the master say master don't you care that we perishing you know the lord just got up and he and he just spoke peace be still to the wind and waves and they obeyed him they the yo-yo then they went calm or maybe they begin to talk about you know how how they just crossed the sea there then legion came out of the tombs and fell down at jesus's feet and you know the lord cast that legion of demons out of that man and they because the devil's got to find a host to to to work through you know that the law consented that they would you know go into the swan because they wanted to go into something to manifest themselves but those swine ran into the sea and they drowned themselves they didn't want to be possessed by any evil spirit you know or maybe they talked about when jesus not that long before you know before his crucifixion you know rode triumphantly on a back of a donkey fulfilling the prophecy of isaiah you know going up there everyone's crying hosanna hosanna to the son of david and or maybe maybe they'd relate about when he healed the lepers or opened the eyes of the blind man or you know whatever incredible things he did you know they were they were talking about everything he did maybe their favorite one was you know when lazarus was you know dead four days in the tomb and you know the lord walked to his tomb and in his humanity he wept because he felt you know sad that his friend had died and mary martha were crying because he had compassion upon people's life but but then he pushed back his little shoulders and cried out with a loud voice lazarus come forth and you know the prophet told us if he did not call lazarus by name there would have been a general resurrection because he is the resurrection and the life and you know you know maybe that would have been their favorite one and you know they would be relating their favorite testimonies of what the lord had done in their day you know it's the same thing you know even if we could parallel today you know you begin to talk about what god has done in our day and you know i'm not just even talking about you know we can talk about the testimony of you know what god did through the prophet you know raising the dead healing the sick you know mass healings there in durban south africa many places around the world storm being spoken out of existence the soul coming into his hand the word coming open you know all those things but then we could even bring it you know not just 60 years ago but bring it into 2021. you know how he's how he's healed the second helmets cast out the devil in helmets people have been transformed by the holy ghost yo this message is put on flesh you know and and and you and i you know we can talk about those kind of testimonies and you'll find when you begin to talk about those kind of testimonies you know of what god has done where the word becomes living you know that's when he draws there the atmosphere begins to change who knows what i'm talking about who wants more of that you know we can't put a limit on god we can't you know he doesn't have a cap man has tried to box him for for you know ever since adam and eve in the garden you know man has tried to box god but you we can't box god you know he will not be boxed man tries to put him in a denominational box and say this is what god is and that's it god just steps out of the box and works on with someone else you know i don't want him to work on with someone else i said lord come and live in our lives come and manifest your word through your you know you know through your people in this end time hallelujah amen but then so he drew now and he went with them and he opened the scripture now cornelius if we can go back to him no actually rather i'll say this when you prepare when people prepare for a visitation they go through normally a lot of work because it's on their heart they won't they want the visitor to feel welcome right who's with me you want your visitors to feel welcome you invite someone you don't want them to feel unwelcome in your house you want them to feel welcome that they'll want to come back again so you know maybe you'll clean up the house you know christine will you know cook up a storm and you know we'll do different things because we want whoever's walking through our front door we want them to feel welcome now brother branham wood would speak about if you know he would he would put out different characters and say you know imagine if if the queen of england came to your house and he's talking to americans here in america he said even though she is not the queen over us yet because she's such a fine woman you know would be so thrilled if she decided to come to our house and you know imagine if the queen did come to our house you know we'd clean up we would want to put on a good impression you know brother bram says if she came to your house you know and she saw something maybe a favorite painting or something that's nice you know and she said oh could i uh have that you know that's very nice thing you know you'd be so honored to give it to her why because because you know it was such a privilege to have her come and the reason that you know that happens is because people would prepare for the visitation now i'm not talking about when i talk about preparing for a visitation of the lord i'm talking about outward things sure because you know it is how we you know what's on the inside should manifest on the outside right who's with me but the thing is some people can have it on the outside but nothing on the inside and it's really the condition of the heart that that sure it will manifest on the outside but it's really the condition of the heart and the receive how how can receive a visitor how i can receive the lord jesus you know we want to have tender hearts don't we we want to be flexible to his word you know this this world is very hard-hearted we've been told to be kind in this day it's been repeated over and over again and i can just ask the question why do we need to be reminded to be kind because people need to be reminded to be kind because because iniquity has abounded the love of many has wax cold and there's very little love left in the world sadly but in order to really make a visitor feel welcome it's really our heart's condition that makes him feel welcome now brother brown would say you know the queen comes to your house you know you invite her and you make a welcome uh the president at that time was dwight eisenhower it'd be such an honor to have the president of america come to your house you'd make him feel so welcome but he says but jesus comes and people turn them away but i believe i'm looking at a people who don't turn him away i believe i'm looking at a people who want him in their house that that he is the most precious visitor that they could ever have in their entire life where it doesn't matter if you know it doesn't matter if they're not even known on the footnotes of history now i'm just talking about myself it doesn't even matter if they're not even remembered by anyone but as long as jesus visited them hallelujah and was made welcome to me that's the most precious thing i want jesus to be welcome in my house now we you say well do we really need a visitation like that do we really need a visitation like the angel lord coming to cornelius you know we have the holy ghost we don't need angels to come visit us well i just say this you know who believes the apostle paul had the holy ghost anyone yep good you know he would say when when when he was on the ship and it was about to be shipwrecked and you know the storm would have been gone for about 14 days and you know he came out you know out of his cabin he'd been praying and and he told the captain he told the crew he told everyone he said men be of good chair the angel of the lord whose i am and who i serve came to me this night and said there'll be no loss of life only the ship see the apostle paul had visitations of angels amen peter would be visited by an angel uh in acts chapter 10 just after what we just read so there's visitations of angels there in the old testament we know they're also in the new testament now a visitation of an angel does not stop you know just because we're in this this this era today because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so god can still visit and quite frankly i believe he should still come visit us in that manner where angels can come into your house who wants that who wants that who wants more than just a formal religion and maybe just some nice singing and who wants god to live i mean to do what what only he can do hallelujah so you know i'm not saying that we we are not welcoming to him and we're not inviting to him and you know but but i'm just want to encouraging you you know we can have more you know where brother brown would relate and what what what got me thinking about this was um i just sort of locked down last time and brother john anders was preaching and you know he's preaching about how the angel of the lord can come in and he can visit us he can come into our homes that even though we are alone that we're separated but yet we're together who remembers that okay so maybe we're going down memory you know laying a bit but you know we don't just wanna um you know i pray and yeah i've been thinking about this lockdown for myself is you know there's a saying never waste a good crisis who's heard that one never waste a good crisis right so the world is not wasting this crisis and you can say well people say it's engineered not engineered whatever whatever you know in my opinion well not in my opinion but you know god is in control of everything who believes that so god has allowed this to happen whether you know what we like it or not you know it's nice to go to work not having to wear a mask you know i had to wear a mask all day today you know it keeps you a bit warm but it's not very nice you know my glasses fog up and looks like i'm kind of driving through the rain you know it's hard but you've got to adjust things and you know and your people you know anyway you just can't go anywhere you want and i know the girls are enjoying it because you know today was like a holiday but um you know there's a lot of things that i wish we weren't locked down in this way of course there's sickness and things going on and families are separated and things but you know however we feel about what's happened the lord has allowed this to happen he's in control and to me the world is looking how can we you know benefit from this crisis and do different things but we should benefit from this crisis we should benefit spiritually from this lockdown where this lockdown is another opportunity if you look at it it's another opportunity to drill closer to god to lay aside the busyness of life praise the lord i mean because we're locked down we can't get well some of us can go places but you know after you go to the supermarket about 20 times it kind of gets a bit redundant you know so it kind of is not too far to go so we should take advantage of this lockdown and draw closer to the lord hallelujah where the lord has allowed us this time that we can get into his word we can spend time in prayer we can come together as families we can rebuild our family altars if they if they're fallen down and if they're there we can we can build them bigger right we can spend time in prayer we can seek the lord out of thanksgiving because he's so what who wants him to draw near you know some people think prayer is a effort or it's a you know this is works to try and get him to come no i love him you know i want to be in his presence more and more i want him to live i want him to you know come and live through us and be so much more real and be real to my family and you know you know what i mean who's with me right that's what we want so there's an opportunity this is a perfect opportunity even though it may be just for a few days you know it's an opportunity to draw closer to the lord to me that's exciting because the lord has allowed this amen and it's all all things work together for good for those that love god and are called according to his purpose am i looking at some of those people praise the lord amen so now brother brown would speak and this is sorry i'm going back to where i was mentioning brother john anders as as as he would he would take a testimony and and he'd speak about two women who were prayed for one had a goiter and i think one had a cancer or something in her stomach or something like that you know and and and they went through the prayer line and the lord through the prophet discerned what was wrong with them prayed for them and the lord said thus saith the lord you're healed now they went off and they went rejoicing knowing that the lord had healed them it hadn't physically manifested yet but they believed that god had spoken to them saying that they're healed and you say well is that scripturally true well the bible says by his stripes we were healed right it's already a finished work so they went on their way they they were neighbors they were living kind of close to each other and and they went rejoicing knowing that the lord had given them a word of promise and now they are walking in faith knowing that it was going to be fulfilled now we are living in an hour where the word the scriptures are going to be fulfilled right all scripture will be fulfilled we know that but we're living in a time where a lot of scriptures that have been laying it seems dormant for thousands of years or hundreds of years are gonna be fulfilled we know the prime one that we are looking for is the dead in christ to rise first first thessalonians chapter four you know the apostle paul would say in corinthians we shall not all sleep but we all shall be changed and that promise has been sitting there in the scripture you can say has been circling the earth until the time of fulfillment now when there is a time of fulfillment that's when you see god begin to pour his spirit out you know and there's visitations of angels there's a supernatural move of god because he's there to fulfill his word you know you can take when jesus first came to the earth you know there was and your angelic visitation to mary there was also to zechariah which was john's father he was there in the temple dirt you know you know waving the incense before the lord and you know the angel of petum said you're going to have the you know you're going to have the son who's going to be the voice of one crying in the wilderness you know the angel came to mary gabriel came to mary and said you're going to be with child by the holy ghost and you know you know then that same angel came and visited um joseph in a dream because he was minded to put mary away privately after this happened and you know there's a lot of supernatural going on and then even even the night of jesus birth you know there's an angelic visitation to the shepherds and you're the star rose in the east and the wise men followed it to bethlehem and you know many many supernatural things are happening why because of scripture many scriptures that had laid there for for you know isaiah would you would prophesy a virgin shall conceive and that lay in the scriptures for about 800 odd years until a time of fulfillment where a predestinated womb was upon the earth who was married who was there to fulfill that promise and you know and then finally you know maybe there would have been hundreds of of of you know of of virgin girls whose fathers when they heard isaiah prophesy a virgin shall conceive that say my daughter's going to be it but when god spoke that through isaiah he knew exactly who was going to fulfill it and that was mary herself are you all following me tonight amen so you know just like peter james and john they were they were they were part of prophecy you know they were part of the prophecy of joel where the lord said that he'd pour his spirit out upon all flesh hallelujah where whereas handmaids as young men will prophesy old men will dream dreams you know the fulfillment of joel chapter two and so those in the upper room were the first part of that fulfillment of that prophecy and god knew the ones who'd be in the upper room so there's a mighty outpouring of the supernatural during that time where a lot of scriptures were fulfilled you know we can even take the you know last few hours of jesus life and he fulfilled many many scriptures very very quickly just in that last portion of his life what was happening prophecy was becoming history but when those prophecies were becoming history there were predestinated people upon the earth to fulfill that prophecy now what happened is the lord would come the angel lord would come and manifest to you know make those promises live to those who ordained to that promise right so here we are in the end time we're looking for the dead in christ to rise where we're already in the process of the rapture cycle because it says in first thessalonians chapter 4 the lord himself shall descend with a shout right and a vindicated prophet said on this day said the shout the message is the shout right so he's already started the rapture process the next says the voice of the archangel which is the life of god will come into maturity in a people and that life will call forth the dead in christ right and then we which are alive and remain will be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air that's the final part of that you know fulfillment of that prophecy but you see when when when the apostle paul was inspired and and he would tell the thessalonians the lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god you know god head on his mind who those people which are alive and remain would be to fulfill that and those who are going to be dead in christ which will fulfill that part of that right so now what happens is god sends the angel of the lord he comes in angelic form to fulfill the word to a predestinated seed hallelujah so just as he came to mary that the virgin shall conceive so that part of the scripture would be fulfilled or to elizabeth and zechariah that the voice of one crying in the wilderness john the baptist would be born that part of the scripture would be fulfilled or you know he would he would reveal himself to the shepherds because jesus would be born in bethlehem that part would be fulfilled or even even where balaam would prophesied that a star would rise out of jacob and the wise men would see that in the uh um east and follow that star to the west of bethlehem you know he knew that they would be doing that you know he knew those who would be there to fulfill the scriptures now the angel lord is present to manifest the promise to the people so i'm kind of laboring this because i just want you to know we're living under a promise right we're not just here going through life living haphazardly you know in this lockdown not in a lockdown in 2021 going to school having a job having church it's more than that where are people living under a promise and the angel of the lord is here to fulfill that promise to you and i now going back to that testimony where where brother brown prayed for those two women you know and and the lord said thus said the lord you're healed i'm not sure how many days later the the angel lord went through that neighborhood and that woman who had that stomach condition who couldn't who couldn't eat anything she found she said like a cool feeling came over her then suddenly she got real hungry so she took a bite of toast and she found out she wasn't sick because normally she'd eat and she'd just throw up immediately she had that bitter toast and then it and then it went down she was fine then she made herself a full breakfast and she ate it all down she still felt fine and she bringing her thank you she began to rejoice realizing that that the promise that was given to her on the platform where the lord had healed her had now been manifested in her body because she was living under that promise but she was walking in faith knowing that that promise was going to be fulfilled and that's what faith is you know it's going to happen it's not i think it's going to happen or i hope it's going to happen you know it's going to happen it's anchored in here i mean you know it's going to be fulfilled right so then she began to rejoice and then she remembered that her neighbor had been who who had the goiter or whatever it was so i don't have the testimony on me right now but you can go and find it you know she was living just down the road so so this woman who got here with a stomach issue ran to her house and when she got to her house she found this woman it was all gone and she was shaking out a sheet trying to find where it went and what had happened the angel lord had gone through that neighborhood to fulfill the promise that was given to them hallelujah and that's how we should be living friends is looking for the angel of the lord to come fulfill his promise in our lives right we have a promise of a body change but before a body change we have a promise will not leave one hoof behind amen so our children are going to come right our our our relatives are going to come our loved ones are going to come right we should just let our faith go and let god operate our faith to believe that all things are possible you know the you know the believer actually lives by the faith of the son of god and what that means is it's not actually your own faith anymore but it's the faith of jesus christ and a people the apostle paul would say the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god hallelujah so the life the apostle paul lived it wasn't his own faith operating amen you know when he healed the sick or whatever happened it wasn't him doing it it was the lord himself the faith of jesus christ now that same faith created the worlds hallelujah that same faith made all things and that same faith was now dwelling in him and he said the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god now friends this is how we should be living not by our own human faith guessing i wonder if it's real is it really going to happen is the word really true but no it should be anchored in our hearts amen the word is true the promises are yeah and amen hallelujah that we're not living by our own human faith but we're living by revelation faith the faith of the son of god hallelujah amen hallelujah you know we're here to have a mighty visitation i believe we're living in the hour of visitation now when i'm talking about a visitation as i've said i'm talking more of a personal visitation i'm talking about the lord coming to you and i personally and fulfilling his word personally i'm not talking about on a dispensational level though we know he has come fulfill the scripture luke 17 30 the son of man has been revealed through the prophet we know these things right we've seen scripture fulfilled on a dispensational level but what about a personal level because if we meditate upon his promises if our hearts are all towards him you know it's just something when love is projected right it brings a closeness amen when you feel love when you have love for your spouse or for your children and you begin to express that love how you treat them things you say it brings a closeness right it doesn't bring a separation and it's the same thing when it comes to us in the lord right when divine love is projected sovereign grace can take over it brings a it brings a closeness and that's what i want the lord to do to be real close now jesus now the devil if i can put it this yeah i'll put this way and and in acts chapter 19 there were vagabond jews exorcists who took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the name of jesus um of the lord jesus saying we're jordy by jesus whom paul preacheth and there were seven sons of skiva a jew and chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know paul i know but who are you see the devil knows as i said it's more than just knowing what god's done on a dispensational level because the devil knows what the lord has done in the past these devils said to the sons of skiva jesus i know so when you know someone you know what they've done you know their works their life their ministry so the devil's saying to to the sons of skiva i know jesus i know he cast out my friends other devils out of people i know he healed the sick cast cast demons out i know he spoke to the storm i know he died on the cross i know he rose again so jesus i know paul i know because i've been cast out by him many times but who are you see it must come down to a personal level where where we know the lord not just you know so the promise is personal to us he's a living god to you and i not just a knowledge on a dispensational side now the the word visitation it's it's used a couple of times in the new testament and and i'm going to kind of wrap up with this luke 19 and 44 it says and shall i uh this is jesus speaking and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in the one stone upon another speaking of jerusalem now because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation and that same word is used in first peter 2 and 12 having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation now this word visitation it actually means an inspection or an investigation it means the act by which god looks into and searches out the ways the deeds the character of men in order to adjudge them their lot accordingly whether joyous or sad so a visitation is actually an investigation and this investigation to me he's looking for hearts who are here to receive him when he investigated the scribes and pharisees he found people that wanted to crucify him right when that same lord jesus went to the woman at the well though men would say that her character was terrible her reputation was ruined you know she didn't have any holy character like the scribes and pharisees when god came when she had her day of visitation and jesus said you know that god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship in his spirit and truth then then the woman said um it says the woman said unto him speaking to jesus i know that when messiah cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things and jesus said unto her i that speak unto thee am he she didn't question it she dropped her water pot ran into the city and said this is not the very christ so when when when when she had a day of visitation though outwardly she was lost and undone inwardly there was a predestinated seed that recognized what god was doing amen and that's the kind of character to me god is looking for is looking for a people that can receive his word that will love him more than anything else that when he comes their way they will give their entire lives to him amen that he will live in them now that's the kind of character he's looking for weren't you glad that god put something in your heart that when he came your way you could receive him hallelujah amen now i just want to say this here we are living in a day where we have been restored back to the original faith of the fathers now when cornelius was there and peter came we won't read it but you can go later but but same time we won't read it but peter came to cornelius house and he began to preach the resurrection the crucifixion the resurrection of our lord jesus christ and when peter yet spake these words the scripture says the holy ghost fell upon them and and they begin to rejoice praise god and speak in tongues and glorify god and then peter said you know seeing this happening he said can we now forbid water knowing that these have received the holy ghost exactly the same way we did in the upper room and so they had received the holy ghost and they were baptized in them lord jesus christ now to me this shows that our lord jesus when he's received in a true way amen he will do the same things he did in the beginning now we know our god is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change his method he doesn't change his ways and we have been restored back to the original right what what god has established not what man changed later down through the ages but what god established were being restored back to the true word of god now our lord jesus is the same and brother brown would say it's actually a keystone to the whole bible that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now when jesus would would um would be there and and the multitude were around them and and you know they were hungry it was it was a few days for them to go and get food and things and you know the disciples wanted to send them away to get food but jesus says what have you got and you know maybe andrew one of the disciples went past and there was a little boy with his lunch and you know asked if they could use that to the master the little boy gave it to the lord jesus and it was just a few fish and a few loaves but you know in the hands of the master he began to multiply it where it was just you know he would he would take the bread and break it and then again and then produce another piece of bread and then break it again and keep breaking breaking bread and fish and it wasn't just fish it was cooked fish and he fed 4 000 men besides the woman on top of their children and then five thousand and you know in another place and what happened is that everyone who came to the lord got the same kind of bread and the same kind of fish so they came and got the same kind of natural food amen it didn't you know he didn't take a piece of bread and bless it and break it and it turned into a donut right or a muffin you know it was exactly the same kind of bread or when he took the fish i know this sounds ridiculous but i'm trying to prove a point when he took the fish and he blessed it and he break it and it was multiplied it didn't turn into a piece of steak it didn't turn into a piece of broccoli it was still fish it was exactly the same right so the people what he multiplied to the people they received the same all of them right and what the lord is showing us he's the same yesterday today and forever so if we come to him he will give us the same member he's the bread of life we're not coming for loaves and fishes for natural natural food this is not why we come to the lord but we come for spiritual food i mean that our souls can be fed our inner man can be fed and so what he's showing is because he's the same yesterday today and forever is the same piece of bread that he gave cornelius in his house that the holy ghost fell on them and the same piece of bread loaf of fish he gave out on the day of pentecost where the holy ghost filled them right is exactly the same loaf and bread that he gives out in this end time i mean to give exactly the same kind of experience a same kind of visitation where god comes down fills the house fills the people and transforms our lives that now it's no longer us living right now it's his word putting on flesh and you and i because he's the same yesterday today and forever and friends in my opinion he is the same he does the same he feels what the holy ghost is saying he causes people to live according to his word the same right he transforms us the same amen it may be different kind of experiences but the life that's lived after the experience is the same kind of life because it's a word life it's a scriptural life it's not a religious life or a nice idea kind of life but it's the word putting on flesh in your eye so i'm so glad that even though that we are uh alone but yet together you know we're talking on this way of zoom like this you know we can invite the lord jesus to come into our house hallelujah i believe that even in this lockdown the angel lord will walk through walk through neighborhoods amen he'll visit our homes i believe he will he will fulfill promises that that that we've been living under waiting to see them fulfilled he's going to manifest that yo now don't doubt doubt doesn't help anyone right you say i've been through a lockdown before and not much happened this is a different season this is a different hour this is 2021. 2020 is in the past this is another opportunity hallelujah that we would come all together maybe you don't talk too much in your house you can break down those walls amen you can actually come together as a family you can pray together you can have god come and visit you in a supernatural way and just take over your life like never before hallelujah amen where he can break to you the same experience that cornelius and those in his house had amen because he's the same today as he was back then amen i believe it hallelujah so who wants the lord to visit them in a supernatural way amen so we're going to pray and then i'm going to pass the service over to brother ed to sing a few songs but i trust this would be your heart's desire during this lockdown yo draw near to god you know you know the rapture which is it means the catching away it's for those who are already caught away if you're excited about the word of god if there's something in you that just loves him loves his word you know what's happened you're actually caught up in him you're in a love affair amen right because why because you're enjoying you're feasting on the goodness of god and if you've grown a bit cold in your walk spend some time with them say lord you said yo you know in order to resist the devil who wants to resist the devil we know the devil's on our case everyone says resist the devil and he will flee from you but the first part of that scripture is draw night to god and he'll draw night to you and this says resist the devil and he'll flee so if the devil's on our case is in our mind he's troubling our family draw nigh to god he'll draw nights to you and then resist the devil how do you resist the devil turn down what he's trying to sell you just say i'm not buying you can knock on someone else's door you're not welcome here amen but let's use this time let's use this time to draw an eye to god like never before as individuals as families and let's believe that the lord is gonna he's gonna visit every house hallelujah who want you know in order for naturally for people to come visit us we naturally prepare but we want to prepare our hearts we're gonna sweep out all the malice and all the strife and all the indifference say lord take your broom of your holy ghost and just sweep me out lord amen i want to be ready for you to come and fill me i want you to be i want to be ready for you to come and fill my house and change our lives and do what only you can do i mean so let's bow he's in a word of prayer if you want to be remembered and prayed you just want to lift your hands of the lord amen you can talk to him as we pray amen let's close our eyes and let's pray gracious heavenly father lord jesus we come to you this night lord i really desire dear god that this
