[53:41] wonderful time

[54:15] all my
[54:16] sins are washed

[54:46] and my
[54:48] sins are
[55:01] hallelujah why don't we give the lord a
[55:03] hand clap for all he's done for us this
[55:05] weekend
[55:09] amen
[55:14] amen isn't he wonderful
[55:17] thank you
[55:18] appreciate the musicians appreciate all
[55:21] the music
[55:22] the singing all of it has been so
[55:24] wonderful heard some new songs this
[55:25] weekend that i'm gonna take home with me
[55:28] and uh
[55:29] uh just was a real blessing
[55:32] a real blessing and uh i was i left uh
[55:35] fairly soon last night after the close
[55:38] before everybody or as everybody stayed
[55:40] i i just wanted to get myself in my room
[55:43] and uh just get my thoughts on the
[55:45] service this morning and and uh
[55:49] uh i was listening to all the singing
[55:52] and i thought lord you're visiting the
[55:54] people down there
[55:55] uh i should i wish i was there and here
[55:58] i am slogging it out
[56:05] i said sometimes my wife asked me what
[56:08] i'm studying how's it going i says
[56:10] beating my head against the rock
[56:13] that says but the rock is jesus
[56:16] and that's how eagles renew their youth
[56:19] as they beat their head against the rock
[56:22] and so that's just the way it goes
[56:24] sometimes amen brother already
[56:26] praise the lord enjoyed the service last
[56:28] night and the preaching of the word and
[56:31] i appreciate how brother already just
[56:33] summed everything up so far and i
[56:35] thought lord this morning help us to tie
[56:37] all the loose ends together
[56:40] i want to say thank you to brother ben
[56:42] for his invitation
[56:44] how many appreciate brother ben and all
[56:46] that he's done
[56:57] appreciate all those that work with him
[56:59] support the ministry
[57:01] you know there's a principle that is
[57:03] revealed in the message of the hour and
[57:05] that is if you rally around the gift
[57:07] that god sends you
[57:09] you will be very successful
[57:13] it comes from the
[57:14] greater than solomon is here
[57:16] brother branham says when israel rallied
[57:18] around solomon they had like a
[57:20] millennium
[57:22] but then jesus said greater than solomon
[57:24] is here but they didn't rally around
[57:27] that gift and israel went into judgment
[57:30] and so the the principle is god sends a
[57:32] gift you rally around it you support it
[57:35] you pray for it pray that god will be
[57:38] with the pastor brother ben all the
[57:39] ministries from the different churches
[57:41] that are here uh appreciate each and
[57:43] every one of you and those that were
[57:45] here some have probably had to be gone
[57:47] home already and
[57:48] and uh we're so thankful for each and
[57:50] every one of them and you've been a
[57:52] great congregation how many of you are
[57:55] from uh this area locally here put your
[57:58] hand up
[57:59] all right
[58:00] and how many of you are from other areas
[58:02] that's everybody else right amen i just
[58:04] wanted to see the contrast that's why i
[58:07] knew it was everybody else but uh praise
[58:09] the lord
[58:11] it's times like these that we can just
[58:15] let god have his way
[58:17] there's this old song that goes let go
[58:19] and let god have his way and we
[58:21] certainly
[58:23] appreciate that i love what the lord is
[58:25] doing here i've been watching brother
[58:26] ben and the brother that are working
[58:28] with him and sisters and all that's
[58:31] happening and
[58:32] i just love what i see it's great
[58:34] potentials you know there's no limit to
[58:37] what god can do a if you let him
[58:40] and b if you don't care who gets the
[58:42] credit
[58:51] god
[58:52] loves his bride
[58:54] and he loves this message
[58:57] which is his love letter to his bride
[59:01] and so as long as you're involved in
[59:03] that getting the message to the bride
[59:06] god will bless you
[59:08] that's the principle as soon as we start
[59:11] to project ourselves or build up a
[59:13] kingdom
[59:14] then god takes his blessing elsewhere
[59:16] because he's in love with his bride
[59:20] amen and we're in love with him amen
[59:23] amen so we have this last service and
[59:25] again up to how much of it just apprecia
[59:27] being here
[59:28] and uh
[59:30] brother uh the brother on the slides uh
[59:33] i gave him the day off
[59:37] we have no slides for you today
[59:39] and uh i'm not sure that's a good thing
[59:41] because he says it
[59:43] forces him to focus
[59:47] and listen to every word that i'm saying
[59:49] and watch my every action so you have to
[59:52] try and do that without my incentive
[59:54] amen let's take our bibles and turn to
[59:57] the book of ephesians chapter 2.
[1:00:13] i feel that the lord has done something
[1:00:16] for you this weekend
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:20] i'm so glad for that
[1:00:21] so glad to be a part of that
[1:00:24] amen like brother branham said you know
[1:00:26] he said people try and
[1:00:29] uh as people think that i'm trying to
[1:00:31] say that that i'm the one doing these
[1:00:34] things
[1:00:35] he says i'm not the one doing them i'm
[1:00:37] only here when he's doing them
[1:00:41] you see that's the way the prophet was
[1:00:43] how much littler ought we to try and be
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:47] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:00:48] of prayer
[1:00:50] wonderful heavenly father
[1:00:52] lord we love you
[1:00:54] lord we couldn't say that enough
[1:00:57] we realize lord even as
[1:01:00] we have
[1:01:01] human relationships
[1:01:03] and those three words mean a whole lot
[1:01:05] to each other
[1:01:06] just i love you
[1:01:08] that we could tell somebody
[1:01:10] and confirm to them the affection that
[1:01:13] we have in our hearts for them
[1:01:15] and yet lord when we tell you that
[1:01:18] they seem insufficient
[1:01:20] they seem lord like words that
[1:01:22] that don't really express
[1:01:24] what our heart feels
[1:01:33] lord i pray
[1:01:39] that you just look down
[1:01:42] into
[1:01:48] into our hearts lord
[1:01:50] and see how we really feel about you
[1:01:55] that's one thing that you can do that we
[1:01:57] can't do
[1:01:59] we can't look into each other's hearts
[1:02:01] lord
[1:02:02] but lord you are the word
[1:02:04] that discerns the very thoughts and
[1:02:07] intents of our hearts
[1:02:09] we thank you lord that it does not say
[1:02:11] you discern the thoughts and intents of
[1:02:13] our mind
[1:02:14] and the raging battle that goes on there
[1:02:17] lord and will until the change of these
[1:02:19] mortal bodies
[1:02:21] but there will come a time in the
[1:02:22] millennium when the devil will be bound
[1:02:26] not physically lord but with a chain of
[1:02:28] circumstance
[1:02:30] lord for he won't have anybody to work
[1:02:33] on he will be unable to affect us any
[1:02:36] moral god
[1:02:38] never again will he be able to sow
[1:02:40] evil thoughts so contrary to your word
[1:02:43] within our minds
[1:02:45] but right now while we're in these
[1:02:47] mortal bodies we realize that we have
[1:02:50] a weakness lord we each have one punch
[1:02:52] as it were that the devil has coming at
[1:02:55] us and and lord we need to keep that
[1:02:57] covered we need to watch over we need to
[1:02:59] keep under the blood under the shadow of
[1:03:02] your wings o god so hover over us o
[1:03:05] great holy spirit
[1:03:07] lord take the service this morning into
[1:03:09] your hands maybe there be somebody in
[1:03:11] the service this morning that would feel
[1:03:13] like i got left by the wayside but lord
[1:03:16] won't you go by and pick them up this
[1:03:18] morning
[1:03:19] and touch them lord and know
[1:03:21] let them know father that you are remem
[1:03:24] you're remembering them and mindful of
[1:03:26] their needs
[1:03:28] lord just direct this little ministry
[1:03:30] according to the way that you would have
[1:03:32] it for we realize with you father all
[1:03:34] things are possible
[1:03:36] and we want to say lord we believe
[1:03:39] and so we commit ourselves to you for
[1:03:42] your glory and ask your blessing upon
[1:03:44] the reading and the speaking of the
[1:03:46] context of your word in jesus christ's
[1:03:49] name
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:52] amen here's a scripture that i've grown
[1:03:54] to really love lately
[1:03:56] as as god has
[1:04:00] made himself
[1:04:01] very real through it
[1:04:03] to me
[1:04:04] and i trust that he will to you
[1:04:07] in verse 1
[1:04:08] chapter 2 of ephesians verse 1
[1:04:11] and you hath he quickened
[1:04:13] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:04:17] wherein in time pass
[1:04:19] you walked according to the course of
[1:04:21] this world
[1:04:22] according to the prince of the power of
[1:04:24] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:04:27] the children of disobedience
[1:04:29] unless of course you were raised in a
[1:04:30] message home
[1:04:33] no it doesn't say that does it
[1:04:35] you all walked according to the course
[1:04:39] of this world according to the prince of
[1:04:40] the power of the ear the spirit that now
[1:04:42] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:04:44] among whom also
[1:04:46] we all had our conversation in times
[1:04:49] past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling
[1:04:51] the desires of the flesh and of the mind
[1:04:53] and we're by nature the children of
[1:04:56] wrath
[1:04:57] even as others
[1:05:00] my title is the next two words
[1:05:02] but god
[1:05:05] but
[1:05:06] god who is rich in mercy
[1:05:10] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:05:14] even when we were dead in sins has
[1:05:17] quickened us together with christ
[1:05:20] by grace you are saved
[1:05:22] and has raised us up together and made
[1:05:24] us sit together in heavenly places in
[1:05:27] christ jesus
[1:05:28] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:05:31] the exceeding riches of his grace
[1:05:34] in his kindness towards us through
[1:05:37] christ jesus amen the lord had his
[1:05:40] blessing to the word you may be seated
[1:05:43] i'm going to go quite quickly this
[1:05:44] morning so i i want you to give me your
[1:05:47] undivided attention i'll try not to hold
[1:05:49] you long but as a result i'll probably
[1:05:51] compress it just a little bit and i
[1:05:53] believe the lord will lead us the way
[1:05:54] that we should go
[1:05:56] now we realize that god
[1:05:58] is love
[1:06:00] and as we as first john 4 says we've
[1:06:02] been speaking about it this weekend we
[1:06:04] have known and believed the love that
[1:06:06] god hath to us how many believe that
[1:06:09] more now than when they first came here
[1:06:11] this weekend
[1:06:12] amen why do you believe it more because
[1:06:14] the word has been revealed to your heart
[1:06:17] and a revelation of the word is faith
[1:06:20] and by faith you are saved and that by
[1:06:23] grace not of works lest any man should
[1:06:25] boast and so we realize that revelation
[1:06:28] that god has poured in our heart it
[1:06:30] causes us to leave a camp meeting happy
[1:06:33] because revelation brings stimulation
[1:06:36] and and you know your stimulation
[1:06:38] brother branham likened it unto wine
[1:06:41] and how that wine is is something that
[1:06:44] stimulates an individual makes him
[1:06:45] forget his troubles and makes him
[1:06:48] forget all the things that are bad and
[1:06:50] kind of makes him happy for no good
[1:06:52] reason but the revelation of god's word
[1:06:54] makes us happy for a good reason
[1:06:57] amen it causes us to realize the
[1:07:00] thoughts that god has in his mind
[1:07:02] towards us so the bible says that he
[1:07:05] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god
[1:07:09] and god in him
[1:07:11] i was in south africa last month how
[1:07:13] many south africans or former south
[1:07:15] africans have we gotten here wow quite a
[1:07:17] few i'm sorry to see i mean that's
[1:07:19] wonderful
[1:07:22] and
[1:07:26] that's all right i teased the south
[1:07:27] africans back home we got a lot in our
[1:07:29] church too and uh i'll give them a rough
[1:07:32] time because south africans have a very
[1:07:34] peculiar nature
[1:07:38] praise the lord and we and we need them
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:47] and i i had a chance to visit the the
[1:07:49] country last month and and uh visit one
[1:07:52] toured around a little bit preaching a
[1:07:53] lot of different churches met a lot of
[1:07:55] different believers fellowship with a
[1:07:56] lot of different ministry and and i
[1:07:58] thought
[1:07:59] now i understand
[1:08:02] praise the lord
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:06] all of god's children are unique
[1:08:09] you're unique
[1:08:10] every one of you individually and god
[1:08:12] knows exactly what you have need of
[1:08:15] and as i was in south africa i was
[1:08:17] thinking about some quotes that i had
[1:08:19] read about the man called nelson mandela
[1:08:22] apparently one of the great men of our
[1:08:25] generation had to you know went from
[1:08:26] being at uh
[1:08:28] what they might call today a terrorist
[1:08:30] uh to studying law and become a leader
[1:08:33] of his people and and brought about the
[1:08:36] end of the apartheid system and all that
[1:08:38] goes with that and it doesn't really
[1:08:39] matter what our thoughts about whether
[1:08:41] what was right and what was wrong but i
[1:08:43] i i was in reading a couple things that
[1:08:45] he said in the news one time and one of
[1:08:48] the things that he said is no man is
[1:08:50] born hating another person
[1:08:52] because of the color of his skin
[1:08:54] or his background or his religion
[1:08:58] people must learn to hate
[1:09:00] and if they can learn to hate they can
[1:09:02] be taught to love
[1:09:04] for love comes more naturally to the
[1:09:06] human heart than it's opposite now i
[1:09:08] better warn you before you say amen to
[1:09:09] here because i'm actually going to uh
[1:09:12] bring about the error of what he's
[1:09:14] saying
[1:09:15] and in another
[1:09:16] phrase he said education as he's
[1:09:19] speaking about teaching these things
[1:09:20] that he says they can be taught to love
[1:09:22] he says another place education is the
[1:09:24] most powerful weapon that you can use to
[1:09:26] change the world you know those are nice
[1:09:28] thoughts for this age that are based
[1:09:30] upon man's psychology and education but
[1:09:32] it's not the great power of god the
[1:09:34] message of the hour tells us differently
[1:09:36] because love is not taught it is
[1:09:38] experienced
[1:09:41] because love is god
[1:09:44] love is a person
[1:09:47] and when you have a portion of that
[1:09:49] person in you then you have love
[1:09:52] and that's why the apostle john could
[1:09:54] say he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:09:57] god
[1:09:58] and god in him
[1:10:00] all right so appreciate what nelson
[1:10:02] mandela had to say in in his thoughts as
[1:10:05] far as humanity is concerned it probably
[1:10:07] was a great thought but you'll never
[1:10:09] teach humanity how to love
[1:10:11] the only way to get humanity to love is
[1:10:15] to get them to experience god
[1:10:18] and as brother branham said if people
[1:10:19] would have received the gift that was
[1:10:21] sent in this hour they wouldn't need a
[1:10:23] police force
[1:10:25] they wouldn't need a fire department
[1:10:27] they wouldn't need a hospital they
[1:10:29] wouldn't need governments all of these
[1:10:31] kind of things why because divine love
[1:10:33] would have taken over
[1:10:34] amen but that's where we're going to in
[1:10:37] the millennium time
[1:10:38] where divine love has the preeminence
[1:10:41] and and mandela said that education is
[1:10:44] not or education is the most powerful
[1:10:46] weapon and i would dispute that and say
[1:10:48] that education is not the most powerful
[1:10:50] weapon
[1:10:51] prayer is
[1:10:55] so love cannot be taught it must be
[1:10:57] experience
[1:11:00] weaponry is not education but it's
[1:11:03] prayer
[1:11:04] amen now i as a person i can't get away
[1:11:07] from the subject of god's love
[1:11:10] now i think i've made that pretty clear
[1:11:12] this weekend
[1:11:13] not my love
[1:11:15] or my feelings
[1:11:17] but understanding the power that is the
[1:11:20] very essence of god
[1:11:23] and that dwells in me particularly
[1:11:27] now
[1:11:27] brother branham likens it to an
[1:11:29] inheritance
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:31] and he says if you had an inheritance if
[1:11:33] you inherited he called it an arcade but
[1:11:36] if you inherited let's say a ranch or
[1:11:38] you inherited a piece of property you
[1:11:40] would want to go and see the property
[1:11:43] you would want to know the boundaries of
[1:11:45] the property you would want to know all
[1:11:48] the assets that are on the property you
[1:11:50] would want to know what's yours how it
[1:11:52] works how the water supply is how the
[1:11:54] power supply is you'd want to know what
[1:11:56] the building is you want to know what
[1:11:58] all the rooms are what they're used for
[1:12:00] where it's located how to access it how
[1:12:03] to enjoy it what's planted on the
[1:12:05] property the trees the vegetation
[1:12:06] everything why because it's yours you
[1:12:09] want to know everything about it but so
[1:12:11] is the love of god yours
[1:12:13] and we want to know i want to know
[1:12:15] everything about it
[1:12:17] i want to know all that it is and and
[1:12:19] people just talk about love from a human
[1:12:21] perspective as though oh you know just
[1:12:23] love everybody no it's not some
[1:12:25] wishy-washy uh half-baked kind of
[1:12:28] a nice feeling it's much more than that
[1:12:32] all right it's it's a the gospel starts
[1:12:35] with love we realize that god so loved
[1:12:37] the world the nature of god is love the
[1:12:40] fullness of the stature of a perfect man
[1:12:43] is love that's christ if i if i just
[1:12:45] turned over the page if you had your
[1:12:47] bibles open we could see even about the
[1:12:49] fivefold ministry is about love
[1:12:52] it says for the perfecting of the saints
[1:12:55] chapter 4 and verse 12 for the work of
[1:12:57] the ministry for the edifying or
[1:12:59] building up of the body of christ
[1:13:01] do we all come in the unity of the faith
[1:13:03] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:13:05] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:13:09] the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:13:11] many people stop there but it goes
[1:13:13] further
[1:13:14] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:13:17] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:13:19] every wind of doctrine now that we could
[1:13:22] go right to love there i think brother
[1:13:24] ben quoted it last night out of the
[1:13:25] church age book is people thought that
[1:13:27] love meant parental care that god's love
[1:13:30] was just doting over us almost like a
[1:13:33] grandfather but god doesn't have
[1:13:35] grandchildren
[1:13:36] he's only got children
[1:13:38] and so god's love is in election
[1:13:41] god's love is that he has children but
[1:13:43] he but the bible says it that we be no
[1:13:46] more children tossed to and fro and
[1:13:49] carried about with every wind of
[1:13:50] doctrine by the slate of man and cunning
[1:13:52] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:13:54] deceive
[1:13:56] verse 15 says but speaking the truth in
[1:13:59] love
[1:14:02] now there's the there's this might been
[1:14:04] my central thought
[1:14:06] lately as i've been pondering the
[1:14:08] ministry and and raising the bride up
[1:14:10] edifying the bride of christ speaking
[1:14:13] the truth and love if you have truth and
[1:14:16] you have it in love that will bring
[1:14:19] about the stature of jesus christ
[1:14:21] many times we spoke the truth without
[1:14:24] love
[1:14:25] we had the truth in the message but the
[1:14:27] love wasn't there
[1:14:29] and then there's those maybe that are
[1:14:32] maybe a little bit uh
[1:14:34] off the word in their thinking and they
[1:14:35] want love without truth
[1:14:38] and say oh everything's just love but
[1:14:39] you got to have truth
[1:14:41] all right you shall know the truth and
[1:14:43] the truth will make you free
[1:14:46] and he that the son sets free is free
[1:14:48] indeed
[1:14:49] all right and so he says but speaking
[1:14:52] the truth in love may grow up into him
[1:14:54] in all things which is the head even
[1:14:56] christ from whom
[1:14:59] the whole body fitly joined together and
[1:15:01] compacted that which every joint
[1:15:03] supplieth now it doesn't say
[1:15:06] compacted by that which the fivefold
[1:15:08] ministry supplieth
[1:15:10] are you with me but which every every
[1:15:13] joint supplyeth according to the
[1:15:16] effectual working in the measure of
[1:15:18] every part
[1:15:20] maketh increase of the body
[1:15:23] unto the edifying or the building up of
[1:15:26] itself
[1:15:28] in
[1:15:29] love
[1:15:30] praise be to god that's the purpose of
[1:15:32] the ministry that's the purpose of the
[1:15:34] church christ is the very love of god
[1:15:38] projected
[1:15:40] now
[1:15:44] god makes
[1:15:47] a son
[1:15:48] as we dealt with that
[1:15:50] and he looks at the earth
[1:15:54] like he looked at his it looks at his
[1:15:56] sons
[1:15:58] i think brother brother already dealt a
[1:16:00] little bit on it when he made the earth
[1:16:02] god's like a contractor he laid out
[1:16:04] everything on the earth everything that
[1:16:06] was necessary for your body was in the
[1:16:08] earth
[1:16:10] everything that was necessary for
[1:16:11] creation was in the earth when god made
[1:16:13] the earth all god had to do was brood
[1:16:15] over it
[1:16:16] and and and speak his word into it and
[1:16:18] that would bring forth life and so is it
[1:16:20] with his sons everything that he put
[1:16:23] that you everything that you have need
[1:16:24] of is potentially in the predestinated
[1:16:27] seed that lays within you
[1:16:29] all you've got to do is lay in the
[1:16:31] presence of god and let him bring the
[1:16:34] life to fruition out of that seed as
[1:16:37] brother always was mentioning like the
[1:16:39] tree and so i want to say this
[1:16:41] you know that as god made man there was
[1:16:44] part of man that couldn't be expressed
[1:16:46] until there was a wife
[1:16:48] and god was reflecting himself that he
[1:16:50] couldn't express all that he was until
[1:16:52] he had a wife and now i want to say
[1:16:55] naturally speaking young men
[1:16:57] if you want to understand love
[1:17:01] get god
[1:17:04] if you want to know what love is get god
[1:17:06] get so full of him until you see him in
[1:17:09] every thought that you have
[1:17:11] you've got to catch his inspiration
[1:17:14] behind every objective that you have in
[1:17:17] your life and if you don't have you
[1:17:19] don't see god in an objective you need
[1:17:21] to get rid of the objective
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:25] god somebody tell me amen here
[1:17:27] amen help me out this morning young
[1:17:30] women
[1:17:31] i know we're all tired
[1:17:33] but you know let's just press in just a
[1:17:34] little bit amen
[1:17:36] young women you won't find god in a
[1:17:38] novel
[1:17:39] or you won't find love in a novel excuse
[1:17:41] me
[1:17:42] god is love but you won't find love in a
[1:17:44] novel which which books and uh there's
[1:17:47] something about young women and romance
[1:17:49] stories
[1:17:50] i'll just hit this while i'm here
[1:17:53] that they get attracted to that it's a
[1:17:55] natural attraction because they want a
[1:17:58] romantic relationship
[1:18:00] and it's natural to desire a romantic
[1:18:03] relationship but what you read in a book
[1:18:06] is not the truth
[1:18:08] the truth of a romantic relationship
[1:18:11] you'll find in here
[1:18:13] you'll find it in the book of esther
[1:18:15] you'll find it in the book of of ruth
[1:18:17] you'll find it in the book of song of
[1:18:19] solomon you'll find it in many places in
[1:18:22] this bible but you won't find the truth
[1:18:24] of it in any novel amen in many things
[1:18:27] many things of which have hurt marriages
[1:18:30] but yet until you see god in everything
[1:18:33] you don't find what love is there was a
[1:18:36] little boy you know might know the story
[1:18:39] how that and i say it often to repeat it
[1:18:41] sometimes as ministers we think
[1:18:42] everybody has already heard everything
[1:18:44] and so we just skip right over it but a
[1:18:46] lot of times people have never heard it
[1:18:47] there's young ones that have never heard
[1:18:49] it people that are are new to the light
[1:18:51] of the hour that have never heard it but
[1:18:53] there was a young man
[1:18:55] a boy that went to his mother and says
[1:18:58] mother is it possible to see god
[1:19:00] and she said no
[1:19:02] i don't know sonny i i can't answer that
[1:19:05] you maybe should ask your sunday school
[1:19:06] teacher and so he goes to a sunday
[1:19:08] school teacher and and he's asked the
[1:19:10] sunday school teacher says teachers can
[1:19:12] a person see god
[1:19:14] and the teacher said oh that's too deep
[1:19:17] for me
[1:19:18] and and uh and she said you better maybe
[1:19:21] ask the pastor and maybe after the
[1:19:23] service that's a good question for him
[1:19:25] so he waited after the service for the
[1:19:27] pastor and the pastor
[1:19:29] came out and he asked the pastor excuse
[1:19:31] me uh pastor he says is it possible for
[1:19:34] a person to see god and the pastor being
[1:19:37] a good theologian he said sonny the
[1:19:38] bible says no man has seen god at any
[1:19:40] time
[1:19:41] and so no i'm sorry it's not possible to
[1:19:43] see god and that didn't really satisfy
[1:19:46] him
[1:19:47] and there was something on the inside of
[1:19:49] the inside that says
[1:19:51] like we're saying this morning all i
[1:19:53] want to see is jesus
[1:19:56] and and one day he was out in a boat
[1:19:58] with an old fisherman that had had taken
[1:20:01] the little boy under his wing and he's
[1:20:03] out there fishing and they're out early
[1:20:05] in the morning which is a good time to
[1:20:06] go fishing and the sun is just beginning
[1:20:08] to come up over the water and
[1:20:15] the old man is
[1:20:16] sitting in the end of the boat and
[1:20:18] there's tears
[1:20:20] rolling down his cheeks and the boy says
[1:20:22] looks at the old man and he
[1:20:24] comes over closer to him and he says sir
[1:20:26] i want to ask you a question
[1:20:28] he says is it possible to see god
[1:20:32] the old man took the boy up in his arms
[1:20:33] and he said sonny that's all i see is
[1:20:36] god
[1:20:38] i see him everywhere
[1:20:40] i see him in the sunrise i see him in
[1:20:42] the sunset i see him in all ways in my
[1:20:45] life and even in all the trials that
[1:20:47] i've been through i've seen the tender
[1:20:49] hand of jehovah that's been guiding me
[1:20:52] all along the way
[1:20:55] i can imagine that all that adam could
[1:20:57] see was god
[1:21:00] as he was in the garden of eden and even
[1:21:02] though god himself in person came down
[1:21:04] in the cool of the evening but as adam
[1:21:06] walked around creation that's probably
[1:21:08] all that he saw was god he saw him in
[1:21:10] nature he saw him in the way the animals
[1:21:12] were he saw him solomon in everything
[1:21:14] that god had created but satan through
[1:21:16] the serpent tried to intellectualize god
[1:21:20] and he tried to get eve to see god from
[1:21:23] a different perspective have you ever
[1:21:25] thought about god in this way god is not
[1:21:27] a thought god is not a doctrine god is
[1:21:30] not an intellectual god is a person
[1:21:32] amen that reflects himself in his
[1:21:34] creation
[1:21:36] and so as as the serpent tried to get
[1:21:38] eve to intellectualize it we realize
[1:21:41] that separated her from behind the word
[1:21:43] the protection of the word and that
[1:21:45] caused the fall of all humanity and the
[1:21:48] separation of humanity from god was to
[1:21:51] intellectualize what god had spoken
[1:21:55] all right so the the serpent said well
[1:21:57] as as god said
[1:21:59] that you lead all eating on all the
[1:22:00] trees she says no god said we can eat
[1:22:02] all the trees but the tree of knowledge
[1:22:04] of good and evil we're not to partake of
[1:22:05] it
[1:22:06] because the day we thereof that day we
[1:22:08] die and the serpent had a nice way of
[1:22:10] explaining it away
[1:22:12] he says you know what god didn't really
[1:22:14] mean that
[1:22:15] what he meant was you become like gods
[1:22:18] you'll kind of change that's what he
[1:22:19] means by death and you know it'll be
[1:22:21] like this and you know you know if you
[1:22:23] tie this quote to this scripture and tie
[1:22:26] this back in over here and you'll
[1:22:27] remember how that he said back in 1947
[1:22:30] and tie that to 1965 and put that all
[1:22:33] together my pretty soon he's got her
[1:22:35] living in the millennium
[1:22:38] and she thought nothing bad can happen
[1:22:40] to me and she ate
[1:22:42] and she and she died
[1:22:44] and adam partook with her not being
[1:22:45] deceived but because of
[1:22:48] love
[1:22:49] he said i can't live without you
[1:22:52] brother bam talks about a girl that went
[1:22:54] off to college
[1:22:56] and uh how that she uh
[1:22:59] she got intellectualized she got
[1:23:01] educated and what that means is she got
[1:23:04] imparted a culture by books
[1:23:07] to think that's the way human beings
[1:23:09] think
[1:23:11] and so she she was thinking about what's
[1:23:14] acceptable and what's not acceptable and
[1:23:16] how you know she was amongst a bunch of
[1:23:18] peers and peer pressure and and begin to
[1:23:20] look at life in a certain way and have a
[1:23:22] certain status and as she came home from
[1:23:24] college with one of her friends she
[1:23:26] arrived at the train station and her
[1:23:27] mother was waiting there but her mother
[1:23:29] was hideously scarred from a fire
[1:23:32] and so his friend was looking out she
[1:23:34] noticed her mother but she didn't know
[1:23:36] it was her mother and she said oh look
[1:23:37] at that ugly woman out there and and uh
[1:23:40] uh she looked so hideous and and the
[1:23:43] daughter uh she got off the train and
[1:23:45] the mother tried to acknowledge her and
[1:23:46] the daughter walked right past her not
[1:23:48] wanting to acknowledge her because of
[1:23:50] what her friend had said
[1:23:52] why love had wax cold
[1:23:55] sin shall abound because the love of
[1:23:58] many waxed cold
[1:24:00] and so now as he as as the the conductor
[1:24:04] was looking on this and knew the mother
[1:24:05] in the situation he took the daughter
[1:24:07] aside and said do you realize what
[1:24:08] you've just done
[1:24:10] is that what you learned by education
[1:24:13] it says you don't even know
[1:24:15] he says you're a little pretty girl he
[1:24:17] says but you'll never compare to the
[1:24:18] beauty your mother used to be
[1:24:21] he says but your mother she gave up her
[1:24:24] beauty that your life might be spared
[1:24:26] she became scarred that you might be
[1:24:28] unscarred and so he says to her you
[1:24:31] don't realize when you were a baby the
[1:24:33] house was on fire and the only way for
[1:24:35] you to get out was for your mother to go
[1:24:37] in so she wrapped herself in a towel she
[1:24:39] ran in she grabbed you but instead of
[1:24:41] wrapping herself back up she wrapped you
[1:24:43] in the towel
[1:24:44] and she came out and so is it with the
[1:24:46] lord jesus christ expressing his love
[1:24:48] i'll never be ashamed of the gospel
[1:24:51] of jesus christ he left his glory in
[1:24:53] heaven and wrapped himself in our sins
[1:24:56] and beast came scarred that we might
[1:24:58] escape our scars
[1:25:02] brother branham says in that quote he
[1:25:04] says i think brother
[1:25:05] when it taken one thing not an
[1:25:07] intellectual being but it taken the love
[1:25:09] of god to send christ to the cross and
[1:25:11] to die there in disgrace and shame
[1:25:14] and you mean to tell me that the
[1:25:15] pentecostal church or any other church
[1:25:18] will turn down the real love of god
[1:25:20] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:25:22] christ
[1:25:23] it's the power of god to salvation
[1:25:26] if you'd rather say holy roller let us
[1:25:29] act like that as long as the love of god
[1:25:31] is down in my heart
[1:25:33] certainly it doesn't matter it says god
[1:25:36] gave the holy spirit god's love to
[1:25:39] control the church
[1:25:41] not smart and educated but love
[1:25:44] gifts goes in the church but it doesn't
[1:25:46] control the church
[1:25:48] love controls the church
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:53] you know we've come
[1:25:54] back to the revelation of the title deed
[1:25:57] we've been restored back not just to the
[1:25:59] faith of our fathers because that was
[1:26:02] that was part of malachi 4's ministry
[1:26:04] but there was also revelation 10 that
[1:26:06] said all the mystery of god would be
[1:26:07] finished
[1:26:08] so we've gone beyond the faith of our
[1:26:10] fathers because they didn't have all
[1:26:13] that was written in the book because
[1:26:14] john was told don't write it
[1:26:17] it's not for this age it's for the last
[1:26:19] days in the days of the voice of the
[1:26:21] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:26:23] sound so we're here we come back to the
[1:26:26] title deed that should be all that we
[1:26:27] see
[1:26:30] not intellectualizing the message
[1:26:33] but the message is the word spoken in
[1:26:35] spirit
[1:26:36] spoken in truth and love and brings a
[1:26:39] bride into position you know uh we
[1:26:42] should only see what god's doing there's
[1:26:44] a lot evil all around us as i said in
[1:26:46] the first service we might be
[1:26:48] dissatisfied with the government
[1:26:49] dissatisfied with the police
[1:26:51] dissatisfied with the medical system you
[1:26:54] know we might be dissatisfied with so
[1:26:57] many different things but let me tell
[1:26:58] you something

[1:30:18] praise be to god
[1:30:21] that's the land that we are going to
[1:30:29] i better see you there
[1:30:32] is all i can say
[1:30:35] you know charles finney was asked
[1:30:38] to prove the message
[1:30:40] one guy came up to him one time
[1:30:43] and said to charles finney
[1:30:45] i believe in god
[1:30:46] i want you to prove to me that what you
[1:30:49] believe
[1:30:50] is better than what i believe
[1:30:52] and charles finney just looked at the at
[1:30:54] the young man and he said let me ask you
[1:30:56] a question
[1:30:58] he says in all that god has revealed to
[1:31:00] you so far
[1:31:02] he says do you serve him fully
[1:31:05] in the light of what you already know
[1:31:09] and the man said had to be honest and
[1:31:12] answer
[1:31:13] no i guess i don't
[1:31:15] he says will you go and serve god fully
[1:31:18] in the light that you already know
[1:31:20] and then come back and ask me the
[1:31:22] question again
[1:31:24] then i'll answer it
[1:31:26] amen
[1:31:27] see so many people want to be proven but
[1:31:30] really they just want to pick holes in
[1:31:31] it
[1:31:32] but really if they just believe there's
[1:31:35] a god
[1:31:37] hello
[1:31:38] if they just believe there's a god
[1:31:40] and start from there
[1:31:43] if they really believe there's a god
[1:31:44] that god will reveal himself to them
[1:31:48] and go from there see we're see we're
[1:31:50] not a denomination we are seekers of
[1:31:52] truth
[1:31:54] we're not like pilate that says what is
[1:31:56] truth
[1:31:57] rather we are like the disciples who say
[1:31:59] we have found truth and to whom would we
[1:32:01] go for thou alone has the words of
[1:32:03] eternal life
[1:32:04] i was in india one time and there was a
[1:32:06] 12 year old boy that came up to me had a
[1:32:08] he had a little rag on his head uh
[1:32:11] signifying he was a sikh
[1:32:13] and they have the little when they get
[1:32:15] baptized they they the sikhs don't cut
[1:32:18] their hair men are women
[1:32:20] and so they that's why they wear the
[1:32:21] turbans and they wraps their hair up on
[1:32:23] top of their head and so this little boy
[1:32:25] was about i don't know 12 13 maybe and
[1:32:28] he came up to me after the service and
[1:32:30] he said sir i want you to prove to me
[1:32:32] that what you're telling is the truth
[1:32:34] and i actually didn't think of finney at
[1:32:36] the time
[1:32:37] and i thought here's a boy i says well
[1:32:39] tell me what you believe
[1:32:41] he says well i'm a catholic
[1:32:44] and i said well if you're a catholic why
[1:32:45] do you have that sikh
[1:32:47] rag on your head it wasn't a turban it
[1:32:49] was just the little bun that they have
[1:32:51] as a young person and
[1:32:53] he said well my family is sick
[1:32:56] and he says late recently i converted to
[1:32:58] catholicism because i couldn't believe
[1:33:00] what the sikh was teaching and now i'm a
[1:33:01] catholic
[1:33:02] and that's what i believe right now he
[1:33:04] says but why should i believe what you
[1:33:06] believe
[1:33:07] and i said to him i says i can't answer
[1:33:09] that question
[1:33:11] but god can
[1:33:13] i says and here's what you do and the
[1:33:14] pastor was standing there i says this
[1:33:16] man will give you some books
[1:33:18] and i want you to read a couple of those
[1:33:20] books and you ask god if it's real
[1:33:28] 2014 i went back to india
[1:33:31] and a young man about 20
[1:33:34] 22 years old somewhere in there 21 years
[1:33:36] old came into the room where we were
[1:33:38] fellowship and the pastor said i want
[1:33:39] you to meet somebody
[1:33:41] and so he walked into the room and he
[1:33:42] looked at me he says he says do you
[1:33:44] remember me
[1:33:46] and i said
[1:33:47] i said no
[1:33:49] and you know fine looking just the glow
[1:33:51] of the gospel on his face
[1:33:53] and i said he said i i met you about 10
[1:33:56] years ago
[1:33:57] and then it was like the lord turned the
[1:33:59] light on i said you had a question
[1:34:02] and i said you wanted me to tell you why
[1:34:05] this message was the truth and then
[1:34:06] smile it up he says it says you remember
[1:34:08] i says i remember he says i believe the
[1:34:10] message
[1:34:11] hallelujah
[1:34:13] now he's a preacher in this message
[1:34:15] and not only that he's won many souls to
[1:34:18] the lord jesus christ
[1:34:20] amen why is that because god proved it
[1:34:23] to him individually
[1:34:25] listen if god doesn't prove it to
[1:34:27] somebody i can't
[1:34:29] it's just that simple i'm not in the
[1:34:31] business of proving it i'm in the
[1:34:33] business of telling it
[1:34:35] and if god will come down and prove it
[1:34:37] to you he will show himself alive
[1:34:41] amen
[1:34:44] so we know that all that was in god he
[1:34:46] poured into christ and all that was in
[1:34:48] christ he poured into the church
[1:34:50] and acts chapter 2 was the love that was
[1:34:52] in god or the love that was god the holy
[1:34:54] ghost coming into the church
[1:34:57] it's not a half-baked love but it's it's
[1:35:00] uh it's the fullness of the power of god
[1:35:04] because when i say it's not a half-baked
[1:35:06] love what i mean is that you've got to
[1:35:08] understand the god who is love is also a
[1:35:10] judge
[1:35:12] you see it's not that love that that
[1:35:15] just excuses everybody for everything
[1:35:18] no it's as i think brother ben said a
[1:35:20] pardon that has been given but you must
[1:35:22] receive the pardon
[1:35:24] and that was the verdict of the u.s
[1:35:26] government in a particular law case a
[1:35:28] pardon is not a pardon unless it is
[1:35:30] received as a pardon you just have to
[1:35:33] accept what god has done for you you
[1:35:35] know jesus said and i've quoted it
[1:35:37] already thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:35:40] with all thy heart with all thy souls
[1:35:42] with all thy mind this is the first and
[1:35:45] greatest commandment and the second is
[1:35:47] like unto it thou shalt love thy
[1:35:49] neighbor as thyself on these two
[1:35:52] commandments hang all the law and
[1:35:55] prophets
[1:35:57] my
[1:35:58] all of the law and prophets even hangs
[1:36:00] on love
[1:36:02] think about that
[1:36:07] so we read ephesians 2 but god
[1:36:11] who is rich in mercy
[1:36:13] for his great love
[1:36:15] wherewith he loved us
[1:36:19] but god
[1:36:21] it's not just a poetic addition to the
[1:36:24] bible by the translators that's exactly
[1:36:27] the way paul said it
[1:36:28] but god comma
[1:36:31] who is rich in mercy
[1:36:33] the amplified says it this way i'm not a
[1:36:35] big promoter of the amplified bible but
[1:36:36] sometimes they get it right
[1:36:38] it says but god
[1:36:40] so rich is he in his mercy
[1:36:43] because of
[1:36:44] and in order to satisfy the great and
[1:36:48] wonderful and intense love with which he
[1:36:52] loved us
[1:36:54] now catch the way you know the king
[1:36:56] james just just uses the distinct little
[1:36:59] phrase he says for his love wherewith he
[1:37:01] loved us but the amplified says because
[1:37:04] of and in order to satisfy
[1:37:07] the great and wonderful and intense love
[1:37:11] with which he loved us
[1:37:14] my what a statement
[1:37:16] great and wonderful and intense but not
[1:37:19] just
[1:37:20] leaving it there but he in order to
[1:37:22] satisfy that love see christianity is
[1:37:25] not
[1:37:26] works it's not man's efforts but it's
[1:37:30] god's love reaching its destination
[1:37:34] it's a continuous unfolding to all who
[1:37:38] believe doesn't matter how long you've
[1:37:40] been in the way god will continually
[1:37:43] unfold himself to you we'll be learning
[1:37:45] about him throughout all eternity or
[1:37:47] he's not an infinite god
[1:37:50] infinite means without limit so we'll
[1:37:52] always be discovering new things about
[1:37:54] our lord
[1:37:56] then that means if god is love then we
[1:37:58] ought to be always discovering new
[1:38:00] things about love
[1:38:03] my we sometimes just limit ourselves too
[1:38:05] much and many times as preachers we
[1:38:07] often we our temptation is just to
[1:38:09] preach the catch phrases and just throw
[1:38:11] out the little things that that we know
[1:38:13] are trues and they're real to us but god
[1:38:15] has commissioned us even as brother
[1:38:16] branham said he says now you brothers
[1:38:18] i'm just touching the surface of it you
[1:38:20] dig down into these things and you bring
[1:38:23] it to the people and that's our
[1:38:24] commission as ministers is to dig down
[1:38:26] so sometimes if if it seems like we're
[1:38:29] we're we're we've arrived at some little
[1:38:31] intricate thought that seems so buried
[1:38:33] so down so far why is that significant
[1:38:35] but god has raided it made it real to
[1:38:37] the minister and he's got to unburden
[1:38:40] his heart
[1:38:41] brother branham says in the message god
[1:38:43] rich in mercy
[1:38:44] he says if you've got eternal life
[1:38:46] tonight if we have eternal life
[1:38:49] then we always were
[1:38:52] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:38:54] life
[1:38:55] we always were and the reason we were
[1:38:57] because we are a part of god
[1:39:00] and god is the only thing that's eternal
[1:39:04] what does eternal mean without beginning
[1:39:06] and without end
[1:39:07] so if you've got eternal life you've got
[1:39:09] life that is without beginning and
[1:39:11] without end if you're an eternal
[1:39:13] creature you're a creature without
[1:39:15] beginning and without end you always
[1:39:17] were in the mind of god
[1:39:20] god never thought a new thought
[1:39:23] that's something that's hard for us to
[1:39:25] imagine uh
[1:39:27] no disrespect i appreciate the thought
[1:39:28] that brother already was bringing
[1:39:30] yesterday but i can't view god like a
[1:39:33] balloon that grew and grew and grew and
[1:39:34] grew because god never thought a new
[1:39:36] thought
[1:39:37] and and so it always was in his mind
[1:39:40] that he would have you and that's what
[1:39:41] makes it amazing because i find brother
[1:39:43] already's explanation easier
[1:39:46] and i i'd love to believe it that way
[1:39:48] but i cannot fathom a god that always
[1:39:51] thought everything
[1:39:52] it's impossible for my human mind but
[1:39:54] that's our god
[1:39:56] and our pea brains can't grasp that how
[1:39:59] great our god is but no matter how great
[1:40:02] you can imagine him he's greater than
[1:40:04] that because he's infinite
[1:40:06] and even when you go back there and all
[1:40:08] of that you were there in his infinity
[1:40:12] you were there in his mind his thoughts
[1:40:13] are not just eternal they're substance
[1:40:16] they're real they must come into
[1:40:18] manifestation in their season in this
[1:40:20] realm but they always were real in the
[1:40:23] mind of god
[1:40:25] oh listen that's beyond human
[1:40:26] understanding i don't know about you
[1:40:28] but but that's way beyond me maybe you
[1:40:30] got a better education than i do and you
[1:40:32] can understand it better but i cannot
[1:40:34] fathom it it is way beyond me
[1:40:38] brother brown goes on he says now we are
[1:40:40] a part of god you always was
[1:40:43] you don't remember it because you were
[1:40:45] only an attribute in god
[1:40:47] you were only in his thinking your very
[1:40:50] name if it ever was on the book of life
[1:40:54] it was put there before the foundation
[1:40:56] of the world
[1:40:58] he knew what you were
[1:41:02] when god had you in his thinking at the
[1:41:04] beginning
[1:41:05] you have to be some part of you your
[1:41:07] life that's in you now had to be with
[1:41:09] god before there
[1:41:12] well then he before he even become
[1:41:14] material on the earth before there was
[1:41:17] anything but god you were one of his
[1:41:20] attributes he knowed what your name
[1:41:22] would be
[1:41:23] he knew what color what color hair you
[1:41:26] would have i'll just say he knew what
[1:41:27] color skin you'd have too
[1:41:29] all right he know all about you
[1:41:32] all right when you was a little boy or a
[1:41:34] little girl
[1:41:36] you would walk around
[1:41:38] and there would just be certain things
[1:41:40] that would just it wouldn't bother the
[1:41:42] other kids but there was seemed like
[1:41:44] there was something in you that cried
[1:41:47] out
[1:41:48] see that's the eagle in the chicken yard
[1:41:50] there was god somewhere yet you were a
[1:41:53] sinner and he says you remember that so
[1:41:56] i'll ask you do you remember that
[1:41:58] amen that's a common trait of the
[1:42:00] elective god he says certainly now what
[1:42:03] was that that was that little form of
[1:42:06] life in you then
[1:42:09] then after a while you heard the gospel
[1:42:12] maybe you went to church
[1:42:14] you picked out this or that went from
[1:42:16] denomination to denomination but one day
[1:42:19] you being a part of god you had to be
[1:42:22] part of the word
[1:42:24] and when you heard the word you knew
[1:42:27] where you came from
[1:42:29] you knowed that was the truth
[1:42:33] you were always the seed was in you
[1:42:35] always the word that was in you that was
[1:42:39] before the foundation of the world saw
[1:42:42] the word and you came to it
[1:42:46] hallelujah he says that's the way it is
[1:42:48] with every born-again believer
[1:42:51] you can hear all the theology you want
[1:42:53] to all the man-made discrepancy but when
[1:42:56] that word flashes out there
[1:42:59] then there is something takes a hold
[1:43:02] you come to it
[1:43:04] and then he quotes the scripture that we
[1:43:05] read you
[1:43:07] who were once dead in sin
[1:43:10] that life has he quickened
[1:43:12] amen
[1:43:15] now i said yesterday
[1:43:18] that
[1:43:19] a that agopo or god's love has three
[1:43:22] forms that's agape agapo agapetos
[1:43:28] that's the noun the verb and the
[1:43:30] adjective i never got to the adjective
[1:43:33] and so i'll just maybe drop this in as
[1:43:35] we're in this subject
[1:43:37] the agapeos being the adjective it's
[1:43:41] actually describes the object of the
[1:43:44] love
[1:43:46] all right so you got love
[1:43:48] love projected
[1:43:50] and then you have a gap pedo so might as
[1:43:53] well give you the word now that is
[1:43:54] translated in the bible beloved
[1:43:58] the object of god's love
[1:44:03] now
[1:44:05] david was a man that had a great love
[1:44:08] for god
[1:44:09] and he wanted to build a temple for god
[1:44:12] how many you know the story second
[1:44:15] samuel chapter seven
[1:44:17] uh
[1:44:18] david talks about you know to the
[1:44:21] prophet he says i want to build here i'm
[1:44:22] living in this great house and god's
[1:44:24] living under a tent he says how right is
[1:44:26] that that's not right at all he says i
[1:44:28] really would need to build something
[1:44:29] great for god that's greater than what i
[1:44:31] live in because he's greater than what i
[1:44:33] am and so so now he had the right
[1:44:36] inspiration and it was the right time
[1:44:40] but the problem was he wasn't the right
[1:44:41] man
[1:44:43] and he and that's the reason that god
[1:44:46] sent the prophet back to him because
[1:44:47] initially the prophet said david you're
[1:44:49] a man after god's own heart do whatever
[1:44:51] is in your heart because the lord is
[1:44:52] with you and and then god the prophet
[1:44:55] goes home and in his prayer time god
[1:44:57] says to him go back
[1:44:59] and tell david
[1:45:00] and he says to him thou shalt say unto
[1:45:02] my servant david thus saith the lord of
[1:45:04] hosts i took thee from the sheep coat
[1:45:06] from following the sheep
[1:45:08] to be a ruler over my people over israel
[1:45:12] and i was with thee whithersoever thou
[1:45:13] wentest and have cut off thine enemies
[1:45:15] out of thy sight and have made thee a
[1:45:17] great name like unto the name of the
[1:45:20] great men that are in the earth moreover
[1:45:22] i will appoint a place where my children
[1:45:24] israel will plant them that they may
[1:45:25] dwell in a place of their own and move
[1:45:27] no more neither shall the children of
[1:45:28] wickedness afflict them no more any no
[1:45:32] neither will the children of wickedness
[1:45:34] afflict them anymore as before time
[1:45:36] and as since the time that i commanded
[1:45:39] the judgment
[1:45:40] the judges to be over my people israel
[1:45:42] i'm sorry and have caused thee to rest
[1:45:44] from all mine enemies
[1:45:46] also the lord telleth thee that he will
[1:45:48] make thee a house and when those days
[1:45:51] are fulfilled i will set up thy seat
[1:45:52] after thee and he shall proceed out of
[1:45:54] thy bowels i will establish his kingdom
[1:45:58] and he shall build a house for my name
[1:46:02] and i shall establish the throne of his
[1:46:04] kingdom forever and then he says i will
[1:46:06] be his father and he shall be my son
[1:46:11] all right now catch this now because i
[1:46:13] said
[1:46:14] when i was dealing with the name
[1:46:15] yesterday i said now remember was
[1:46:17] solomon that wrote proverbs
[1:46:19] that says
[1:46:21] uh
[1:46:21] my son despised not thou the chastening
[1:46:23] of the lord
[1:46:25] for whom the lord loveth he correcteth
[1:46:29] even as a father the son in whom he
[1:46:32] delighteth
[1:46:33] all right so solomon wrote that as he's
[1:46:36] speaking about sonship but he's also the
[1:46:38] one whom god's speaking of saying here i
[1:46:40] will be his father and he shall be my
[1:46:42] son
[1:46:43] all right so he's speaking from that
[1:46:45] perspective of his relationship with god
[1:46:48] and he and god goes on says if he commit
[1:46:50] iniquity i will chasten him with the rod
[1:46:53] of men
[1:46:54] and with the stripes of the children of
[1:46:56] men all right let's get the picture here
[1:46:57] now
[1:46:58] are you with me
[1:47:00] all right now
[1:47:02] we find out that david
[1:47:04] what type of a man was he he was a
[1:47:06] warrior
[1:47:07] he was a fighter
[1:47:09] and because of that you know he brought
[1:47:11] the nation of israel if you actually go
[1:47:13] back into history you'll find the
[1:47:15] ultimate of what god had chosen for
[1:47:17] israel was the kingdom of david and
[1:47:19] solomon from the time that they entered
[1:47:21] into the kingdom to the time of that
[1:47:23] reign and you'll find out in the bible
[1:47:25] it's about 490
[1:47:28] years about that time you see god works
[1:47:30] in 70 weeks with israel in that cycle
[1:47:34] and so now god is dealing in that cycle
[1:47:36] he brought them to the pinnacle because
[1:47:38] it was only david they conquered
[1:47:39] jerusalem
[1:47:40] and god allowed that to wait until that
[1:47:43] time there was in other words a
[1:47:45] revelation waiting for the end of the
[1:47:47] cycle to bring them into position just
[1:47:49] like we've come to the end of seven
[1:47:51] church ages there was a revelation
[1:47:53] waiting that had to be revealed in this
[1:47:55] hour
[1:47:56] all right but you can't just sit back
[1:47:58] you've got to take it you've got to
[1:48:00] possess it all right footsteps is
[1:48:03] possession so now david god said i made
[1:48:06] you a great name
[1:48:07] like the great men of the earth so david
[1:48:10] the name david his parents could say we
[1:48:12] called him david
[1:48:13] but jehovah was the one that gave him a
[1:48:16] name that ranked amongst a great man so
[1:48:18] much so that when you say david you
[1:48:21] think of a king
[1:48:22] because it's a it's a name that means
[1:48:25] something remember i said a name is a
[1:48:27] mark of memorial or honor and so the
[1:48:29] name david was a representation of all
[1:48:32] that he stood for so god took the name
[1:48:34] of david from the sheep coat
[1:48:36] from being a shepherd and raised it up
[1:48:39] to one of the highest name in the earth
[1:48:41] that when people hear the name david
[1:48:44] they think of the king that ruled over
[1:48:46] israel one of the greatest kings that
[1:48:48] ever walked on the face of the earth all
[1:48:50] right but there's a problem there
[1:48:53] in raising his name up
[1:48:57] david's name got in the way of god's
[1:48:59] name
[1:49:03] i gave you a name
[1:49:04] but there's going to come somebody after
[1:49:06] you to build a house for
[1:49:08] my name
[1:49:11] you can't build a house for my name
[1:49:14] because of the characteristics that the
[1:49:16] name david represents
[1:49:18] see if you want to do something for god
[1:49:21] you have to humble yourself
[1:49:24] not be lifted up you see that's why even
[1:49:27] as we've come now into the second
[1:49:28] generation of the message now i realize
[1:49:31] we're past the beginning of it but we're
[1:49:33] fully into the second generation of the
[1:49:35] message and we realize that in the
[1:49:37] second generation of the first exodus as
[1:49:39] israel was coming out of egypt what did
[1:49:41] you have you had names
[1:49:43] moses aaron dathan cora abyram joshua
[1:49:48] caleb lots of big names that we all
[1:49:50] recognize but going into the promised
[1:49:52] land tell me the names of the princes of
[1:49:55] the second generation
[1:49:57] you can't do it
[1:49:59] they're there in the bible but they're
[1:50:00] not significant
[1:50:02] why because they're moving into a
[1:50:04] different kind of ministry the bride is
[1:50:07] moving into a different sphere now there
[1:50:09] was a time in the message that there was
[1:50:11] big-name preachers
[1:50:12] you know i can name names and you maybe
[1:50:14] recognize the names but the names aren't
[1:50:16] important but those names are going off
[1:50:18] the scene now
[1:50:20] but we are called to possess the land
[1:50:24] and it will god will possess this land
[1:50:27] by a body working together
[1:50:29] every joint supplying to the body
[1:50:39] now david
[1:50:41] his own name actually
[1:50:43] uh
[1:50:44] ties back to the word
[1:50:46] beloved
[1:50:47] in many ways but it's not the name
[1:50:49] beloved but it's it ties back to it they
[1:50:52] say they're they're there's an uncertain
[1:50:54] uh um
[1:50:56] uh i don't know what you call entomology
[1:50:58] or something that's a big word that's a
[1:51:00] 50 cent word but you know
[1:51:02] it's i don't know what you call it where
[1:51:04] the name comes from there uh whatever
[1:51:06] it's connected to all the beginnings of
[1:51:08] it i i don't understand that stuff but
[1:51:10] you know it's there's something about it
[1:51:12] david that's tied to that but they're
[1:51:14] uncertain about it but david was a man
[1:51:17] that people loved
[1:51:18] you know saul loved david
[1:51:21] but with human love
[1:51:22] that's why human love is so corruptable
[1:51:24] bible says one place he loved him says
[1:51:27] in another place he was jealous of him
[1:51:28] and then finally says he hated him
[1:51:31] so filio love can turn from love to
[1:51:33] hatred
[1:51:34] but agapo love will never turn from love
[1:51:36] to hatred
[1:51:37] all right and so david now uh he was
[1:51:41] loved by women
[1:51:43] 500 wives
[1:51:45] mercy
[1:51:48] and there's nothing wrong with a good
[1:51:49] wife
[1:51:51] but you know i
[1:51:53] i'll leave it there
[1:51:56] i'll just say to your brother brothers
[1:51:58] but you know
[1:52:01] amen
[1:52:03] and he's loved by the nation of israel
[1:52:07] amen
[1:52:08] israel loves david what do they have on
[1:52:10] their flag
[1:52:11] the star of david
[1:52:13] it's a significant to them they're
[1:52:15] looking for the throne of david
[1:52:17] david was loved by god he was a man
[1:52:19] after god's own heart but after
[1:52:22] david took bathsheba and killed uriah
[1:52:26] because bathsheba became pregnant from
[1:52:29] their adultery and david set uriah up
[1:52:32] for a fall and and actually was
[1:52:35] accomplice in his murder and so that god
[1:52:38] accounted it as murder and so that in
[1:52:40] all of that now we would say if as we
[1:52:43] looked at david and bathsheba and all of
[1:52:45] that and the first son that came out of
[1:52:47] that or the son that was born
[1:52:49] excuse me out of that adultery god took
[1:52:52] the life of that child it died within
[1:52:54] seven days
[1:52:55] and now we would look at that maybe in
[1:52:57] our legalistic viewpoint and say
[1:53:00] nothing good will ever come out of that
[1:53:02] relationship
[1:53:06] we would say that there's no hope the
[1:53:07] beginnings of it are wrong it was
[1:53:10] there's adultery there's murder there's
[1:53:12] all kinds of wrong things but yet
[1:53:14] god had something in mind here
[1:53:18] you see the way of god is way higher
[1:53:21] than mankind don't ever judge something
[1:53:24] just because you think you understand it
[1:53:26] rather just say lord reveal to me your
[1:53:28] mind in this situation
[1:53:30] you might say you might be better off
[1:53:32] just to walk away from and say lord i
[1:53:33] don't understand
[1:53:35] i just don't understand you know there's
[1:53:37] nothing wrong with having questions
[1:53:41] matter of fact we'll have questions
[1:53:42] right up to this body change
[1:53:45] because then we will know even as we are
[1:53:47] known
[1:53:47] the questions will all be answered by
[1:53:49] and by but as we go through life you
[1:53:51] might have questions tonight you know
[1:53:52] brother tim i've had questions for years
[1:53:55] that i've wondered about so have i
[1:53:59] just because i study the word and pray
[1:54:01] and preach and all those kind of things
[1:54:03] that doesn't mean i don't have questions
[1:54:04] there's always things as god opens a
[1:54:06] little bit of the window you want to see
[1:54:08] a little bit further and you have a
[1:54:10] question well how does this fit or how
[1:54:11] does that fit any ministers know what
[1:54:12] i'm talking about you always have these
[1:54:14] things just let it be god will reveal it
[1:54:17] in his season
[1:54:19] it's not for us to understand and to
[1:54:21] counsel god is for god to understand and
[1:54:24] counsel us
[1:54:26] amen so now
[1:54:29] david the bible says after the child
[1:54:31] died he comforted his bathsheba his wife
[1:54:34] and went in to unto her and lay with her
[1:54:36] and she bear a son and he called his
[1:54:38] name solomon
[1:54:40] and the lord loved him
[1:54:43] hallelujah
[1:54:45] just like jacob have i love he saw have
[1:54:47] i hated
[1:54:48] and he sent by the hand that's god sent
[1:54:51] by the hand of nathan the prophet and
[1:54:53] called his name
[1:54:55] jedediah because of the lord and the
[1:54:58] word jedediah means beloved of jehovah
[1:55:04] my
[1:55:05] so now here's god representing something
[1:55:07] in solomon because he was a type of the
[1:55:10] son of david where god would come down
[1:55:13] at the baptism of the lord jesus christ
[1:55:15] in the fullness of his deity to take up
[1:55:17] residence in the lord jesus christ and
[1:55:19] say this is my beloved son
[1:55:23] in whom i'm pleased to dwell so beloved
[1:55:26] is a representation of the object of
[1:55:30] god's love are you with me
[1:55:33] god says about solomon he prophesied
[1:55:35] concerning and said he shall build a
[1:55:37] house for my name i shall establish his
[1:55:39] throne of his kingdom forever i will be
[1:55:42] his father and he will be my son
[1:55:45] amen so solomon knew what it was to be a
[1:55:48] type of the lord jesus christ even the
[1:55:49] lord jesus christ had to learn obedience
[1:55:51] by the things that he
[1:55:53] suffered
[1:55:54] amen now why is that it's not that he
[1:55:56] was disobedient
[1:55:58] we were sometimes disobedient as we
[1:56:00] walked by the spirit that works in the
[1:56:02] children of disobedience
[1:56:05] but yet christ was never disobedient he
[1:56:08] was only tempted to be disobedient
[1:56:11] but he had to suffer things by his
[1:56:14] obedience
[1:56:15] contrary to the disobedience of the age
[1:56:20] jesus said as the father has loved me
[1:56:23] so have i loved you
[1:56:26] what does that mean as i am the beloved
[1:56:29] of my father
[1:56:30] so are you my beloved
[1:56:33] hallelujah brother branham says in the
[1:56:35] church age book he says it was god's
[1:56:37] purpose
[1:56:38] to bring forth a people like unto
[1:56:40] himself
[1:56:41] that would be a word bride
[1:56:44] she was chosen before the foundation of
[1:56:46] the world in him
[1:56:48] all right let me just rephrase that
[1:56:51] you were chosen
[1:56:53] before the foundation of the world in
[1:56:56] him
[1:56:58] you i'm gonna instead of she i'm gonna
[1:57:00] say you you were foreknown
[1:57:03] and beloved
[1:57:05] before you were ever brought forth in
[1:57:08] the ages upon the earth
[1:57:12] you were redeemed by his blood and can
[1:57:15] never come into condemnation
[1:57:18] listen to what he says
[1:57:20] you were redeemed by his blood and can
[1:57:23] never come into condemnation have you
[1:57:25] accepted what he's done for you
[1:57:28] then you can never come into
[1:57:29] condemnation as our brother said you can
[1:57:32] never pay twice for the same sin
[1:57:35] it's a double indemnity clause it's you
[1:57:37] can't do that god already paid for your
[1:57:39] sin on calvary by the blood of jesus
[1:57:42] christ and he redeemed you by that blood
[1:57:44] and you accepted his pardon then you can
[1:57:46] never come into the condemnation you can
[1:57:49] never be in the judgment because sin
[1:57:52] cannot be imputed to you
[1:57:57] i don't know how you're still sitting
[1:57:58] down
[1:58:00] praise the lord sin cannot be imputed to
[1:58:03] me
[1:58:04] i have accepted what the lord jesus
[1:58:06] christ has done for me i have no merits
[1:58:09] in myself there's nothing that i have
[1:58:10] done but i accept fully what he did for
[1:58:13] me i can never come into the
[1:58:15] condemnation i can never come into the
[1:58:17] judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:58:20] to me
[1:58:21] blessed is the man to whom god cannot
[1:58:24] impute sin
[1:58:26] hallelujah why because you were beloved
[1:58:29] in his thoughts you were in love in his
[1:58:32] mind you were the object of the love
[1:58:35] that was god and that love became
[1:58:38] expressed and to sovereign grace
[1:58:41] produced the object
[1:58:44] amen the object is his beloved
[1:58:47] the object is his elect you've been in
[1:58:49] his mind and now he's here to fellowship
[1:58:51] with you
[1:58:53] hallelujah he took it out of his mind
[1:58:55] and put it in the flesh just like he
[1:58:57] took eve out of adam
[1:59:00] and she was the object of his love
[1:59:02] that's why when she fell and the serpent
[1:59:05] with the serpent
[1:59:07] adam could have said
[1:59:09] tough luck
[1:59:11] you did it
[1:59:13] you've got to pay for your own sin i
[1:59:16] know what it what it is i know exactly
[1:59:18] what's happened i know exactly what
[1:59:20] you've done and i'm not having any part
[1:59:22] of it
[1:59:27] but he didn't
[1:59:29] he took eve
[1:59:30] he says honey
[1:59:32] i can't live without you
[1:59:34] he was a type of cries
[1:59:36] he says i don't care what you've done
[1:59:39] and i know that if i let you go you'll
[1:59:41] die and i'll live
[1:59:43] but my life isn't worth living without
[1:59:44] you
[1:59:48] laurie
[1:59:50] that's the expression of jehovah
[1:59:52] who said my life is not worth living
[1:59:54] without you
[1:59:57] hallelujah he became sin that we might
[2:00:00] become sinless
[2:00:02] he became man that we might become deity
[2:00:04] expressed in human flesh
[2:00:08] what is it the love of god
[2:00:10] it's beyond human thinking it's beyond
[2:00:12] anything that man has done
[2:00:15] i got a letter from india one time not
[2:00:17] too long ago actually a brother was
[2:00:18] asking me some questions about
[2:00:20] relationships and different things and
[2:00:21] what about this and how should this be
[2:00:23] handled in the church and that sort of
[2:00:24] thing and i replied i just said this is
[2:00:26] what's in the message this is what's in
[2:00:28] the scripture you've got to apply the
[2:00:29] word
[2:00:30] it says here's what it is it's not up
[2:00:32] for me to run your church
[2:00:33] it says i'll give you what the message
[2:00:35] says about it
[2:00:36] and then you got to pray about it and
[2:00:38] apply it so then that was fine i thought
[2:00:40] i'd heard the end of it then he wrote me
[2:00:42] back
[2:00:43] and i could see the first letter
[2:00:45] was to test me so that he could write
[2:00:47] the second letter
[2:00:50] and then he said brother tim i so
[2:00:52] appreciated what you said in the first
[2:00:53] letter i thought it was very well
[2:00:54] applied i have one more question
[2:00:57] he says
[2:00:59] is it
[2:01:00] does a man have a right to put away his
[2:01:02] wife for fornication
[2:01:09] now i'm in a spot aren't i
[2:01:12] you can now see there's a motive behind
[2:01:14] this somebody wants me to support him in
[2:01:17] what he wants to do
[2:01:19] all right
[2:01:21] i thought lord how am i going to answer
[2:01:22] this man
[2:01:24] because the scripture
[2:01:26] definitely says
[2:01:28] about these things and i thought lord
[2:01:30] what am i going to do
[2:01:32] and then it came to me
[2:01:34] i said brother
[2:01:36] i says yes a man has a right to put away
[2:01:39] his wife
[2:01:40] for the cause of fornication
[2:01:42] that's right in the scripture
[2:01:44] i said but because something
[2:01:46] because you have a right to do something
[2:01:49] doesn't make it the right thing to do
[2:01:57] and i said the lord jesus had a right to
[2:01:59] put us away
[2:02:02] god had a right to put israel away and
[2:02:04] have nothing to do with them anymore but
[2:02:06] he says i'll never forget you you're
[2:02:08] written on the palms of my hands
[2:02:11] amen that's the god that we serve that
[2:02:13] reflected himself in adam and says i
[2:02:16] can't live without you
[2:02:18] hallelujah
[2:02:21] because of and in order to satisfy the
[2:02:25] great and wonderful and intense love
[2:02:28] with which he loved us
[2:02:30] in order to satisfy
[2:02:32] his great love he quickened us
[2:02:35] by grace you'll never get beyond love
[2:02:39] you'll never be able to to move beyond
[2:02:42] that kind of a realm in your
[2:02:43] relationship with god brother branham
[2:02:45] says when god's love was projected
[2:02:47] sovereign grace had to produce the
[2:02:49] object that his love projected he says
[2:02:52] when you love god and believe god grace
[2:02:55] will project the object that you ask god
[2:02:58] says your abraham's seed then you love
[2:03:01] god and when you love god
[2:03:04] so love him that you believe his word
[2:03:08] accept his word
[2:03:10] then sovereign grace will come down and
[2:03:13] project what you ask god
[2:03:17] because he
[2:03:18] cannot keep from it
[2:03:21] think about it that's the basis that
[2:03:23] it's on is love
[2:03:25] and love will project grace and grace
[2:03:28] will project the object that you're
[2:03:29] asking for you can't get it by emotions
[2:03:31] you can't get it by scholarship in other
[2:03:33] words by learning doesn't matter how
[2:03:35] many quotes scriptures you know how much
[2:03:36] you can tie together that ain't going to
[2:03:38] produce nothing
[2:03:39] it's got to be love paul says in the in
[2:03:41] first corinthians though i have the gift
[2:03:43] of prophecy and understand all mysteries
[2:03:45] and all knowledge
[2:03:47] though i have all faith so that i can
[2:03:49] remove mountains and have not love
[2:03:52] i am nothing
[2:03:54] is this all right this morning
[2:03:56] it says you never get it by education
[2:03:58] you never get it by sensations
[2:04:01] you get it by love
[2:04:03] you believe him and take his word for it
[2:04:04] and when you take his word that makes
[2:04:06] him love you
[2:04:08] and you get what you ask for
[2:04:11] see that's the rapture
[2:04:14] when you believe him and accept his word
[2:04:17] and just love him then sovereign grace
[2:04:19] will produce the object that you're
[2:04:21] asking for see there's got to be a bride
[2:04:23] that's uncomfortable in this world
[2:04:25] remember in the first exodus when god
[2:04:27] came down to deliver israel he said i
[2:04:30] have heard the cry of my people
[2:04:33] all right by reason of what
[2:04:35] they're task masters
[2:04:37] by reason of the the living that they
[2:04:39] have been subjected to down there in
[2:04:41] egypt there was many years that they
[2:04:43] were comfortable but then there rose up
[2:04:45] a pharaoh that knew not joseph
[2:04:47] and so god had to make the age
[2:04:49] uncomfortable because it wasn't his will
[2:04:51] to leave his the children of israel in
[2:04:53] egypt he had a promise for them and it's
[2:04:56] not his will to leave the bride on this
[2:04:58] earth
[2:04:59] amen he's got a place for you but
[2:05:02] there's got to make it uncomfortable
[2:05:03] till his bride begins to cry out oh lord
[2:05:06] we're not comfortable here we're not
[2:05:08] happy here it's got to get evil
[2:05:11] it's got to become a sodomite age it's
[2:05:13] got to become ruled by unjust laws it's
[2:05:16] got to be a persecution against religion
[2:05:18] there's got to be all those kind of
[2:05:19] things not necessarily a personal
[2:05:21] persecution but against that which is
[2:05:23] right
[2:05:24] and so because of that age there's got
[2:05:26] to be a cry out to god
[2:05:29] god has a way of turning things around
[2:05:31] just when it seems like there's no hope
[2:05:34] you know back when i'm going to go
[2:05:35] quickly now back when abraham was being
[2:05:38] dealt with by god abraham was god's
[2:05:40] servant somebody mentioned that already
[2:05:42] and and
[2:05:43] he lied about his wife
[2:05:45] and said that's my sister and abimelech
[2:05:47] took the
[2:05:48] took the woman and and is going to marry
[2:05:50] her and they got it all arranged and
[2:05:52] they're just coming up till seems like
[2:05:54] the day before the marriage and then the
[2:05:56] scriptures scripture says
[2:05:58] but god
[2:06:00] came to abimelech in a dream by night
[2:06:03] amen it all looked bad but god protected
[2:06:06] the seed line
[2:06:08] when satan would disrupt what god had
[2:06:10] already spoken but god came down
[2:06:14] just at that time he watched over jacob
[2:06:17] even before he came to the full
[2:06:19] revelation of who god was and jacob paid
[2:06:22] seven years for rachel in seven years
[2:06:24] for leah and and six years for wages and
[2:06:26] all the things that he suffered and when
[2:06:28] he left the land he recounted it to his
[2:06:30] father-in-law he says he or to his wives
[2:06:33] he says i see your father's countenance
[2:06:35] is not before not towards me anymore
[2:06:37] he says but the god of my father has
[2:06:40] been with me
[2:06:42] it says you knew with what power i've
[2:06:44] served your father
[2:06:46] and your fathers deceived me and changed
[2:06:48] my wages ten times but god suffered him
[2:06:52] not to hurt me
[2:06:54] think about that statement brothers that
[2:06:55] are working sometimes we have a lot to
[2:06:57] complain about of the way that we're
[2:06:58] treated at work
[2:07:00] and that's the way
[2:07:01] uh that's the way jacob was talking
[2:07:03] about his father-in-law it wasn't right
[2:07:05] the way i was treated he changed my
[2:07:06] wages ten times i just served him with
[2:07:08] all my strength and i never got the full
[2:07:11] reward from it but god suffered him not
[2:07:13] to hurt me
[2:07:15] amen god allowed these things to happen
[2:07:17] this way
[2:07:21] saw david was being pursued by saul he
[2:07:24] abode in the wilderness and strongholds
[2:07:25] remained in the mountains in the
[2:07:27] wilderness of zif as the bible says and
[2:07:29] the bible says saul sought him every day
[2:07:33] he's living in us you know how small
[2:07:35] israel is
[2:07:36] it's a tiny nation
[2:07:38] and saul is pursuing him every day then
[2:07:40] the scripture says
[2:07:42] but god
[2:07:44] delivered him not into his hand
[2:07:47] it wasn't david it was god
[2:07:49] sometimes we think oh this almost
[2:07:51] happened to be that old man it wasn't
[2:07:52] you it was god watching over you
[2:07:56] david writes who have i in heaven but
[2:07:58] thee
[2:07:59] there is none upon the earth that i
[2:08:00] desire beside thee my flesh and my heart
[2:08:04] faileth
[2:08:05] but god is the strength of my heart
[2:08:08] hallelujah but god is the strength of my
[2:08:10] heart and my portion forever
[2:08:14] i love the story of joseph
[2:08:20] i went through a a very serious trial in
[2:08:22] my life
[2:08:24] and uh
[2:08:25] not really a trial of my faith
[2:08:27] as much as a trial on my stamina i never
[2:08:29] really wavered in my faith knowing god
[2:08:31] does all things well
[2:08:33] most of you know if you're not all of
[2:08:34] you know that i lost my wife in 2012
[2:08:38] but she wasn't sick
[2:08:41] matter of fact they did a complete
[2:08:42] autopsy on her
[2:08:44] never found any reason why she should
[2:08:45] have died
[2:08:47] but i thought it was shocked to the
[2:08:48] medical community i could see that they
[2:08:50] actually suspected me
[2:08:52] because here's a healthy woman and she
[2:08:54] died
[2:08:55] and they thought my but you know i had
[2:08:57] about as wonderful a relationship as a
[2:08:59] man could have with his wife
[2:09:01] and
[2:09:02] and in that you know i had always
[2:09:04] thought in myself
[2:09:07] you know what
[2:09:08] if i lose everything
[2:09:10] if i lose the church
[2:09:12] if i lose
[2:09:14] the children if i lose my ministry if i
[2:09:17] lose everything as long as i got allison
[2:09:19] i'd be happy
[2:09:22] so what god take
[2:09:26] see if you want god to take you further
[2:09:29] be careful what you pray
[2:09:30] for lord whatever it takes
[2:09:34] but god knows what every man can handle
[2:09:37] i it was just brought in into my
[2:09:39] remembrance who was the song leader this
[2:09:41] morning you were
[2:09:42] god was leading you just to remind me of
[2:09:44] this
[2:09:45] uh
[2:09:47] you know when i was 50 years old they
[2:09:49] had an anniversary for me i hope you
[2:09:51] don't mind the personal commentary
[2:09:53] but
[2:09:54] they had a
[2:09:55] 50th birthday thing for me at the church
[2:09:57] and they all got together and they made
[2:09:59] a video and all these kind of things the
[2:10:00] slideshow of my life and my ministry and
[2:10:02] that that was very nice
[2:10:05] but the song that they set it to was
[2:10:08] now i know the time is near
[2:10:11] when everything that i hold dear
[2:10:16] and i was sitting there watching that
[2:10:19] i thought isn't that strange
[2:10:22] not only did they set it to that song
[2:10:24] they said it to my wife singing that
[2:10:26] song
[2:10:28] and i didn't think anything of it at the
[2:10:30] time
[2:10:31] three months later she was gone
[2:10:35] god has a way of doing things
[2:10:38] and taking a man and i looked at the
[2:10:39] life of joseph
[2:10:43] and i as i was in the trial
[2:10:46] that i was as i was
[2:10:48] you know i wasn't i felt like i was
[2:10:50] dropped in a pit like joseph
[2:10:52] it wasn't all of a sudden here will
[2:10:54] lower you down easy you know just a
[2:10:56] little bit oh just here you go
[2:10:58] and uh you know you're down in the
[2:11:00] bottom all of a sudden unexpectedly you
[2:11:02] don't get to say goodbye to your wife
[2:11:04] you know you're you're it's just gone
[2:11:06] just ended and and so you know you maybe
[2:11:09] if i'd have been more spiritually
[2:11:10] sensitive it wouldn't have been that way
[2:11:11] maybe i would have known what was
[2:11:12] happening there were certainly
[2:11:14] indications you know god god knows what
[2:11:16] he's doing seemed like my wife knew it
[2:11:18] was happening she began to give things
[2:11:19] away and say take care of this i won't
[2:11:21] need it no more
[2:11:22] and you know things like that would
[2:11:24] happen and and
[2:11:28] but nobody really noticed it and so as i
[2:11:30] as i began i knew what it would be a
[2:11:32] long journey
[2:11:34] i said to myself
[2:11:36] this is probably going to be the worst
[2:11:37] thing i'll ever go through in my life
[2:11:40] and so while i'm here
[2:11:42] i want to look around
[2:11:45] as i walk through the valley of the
[2:11:46] shadow of death
[2:11:49] i'm not going to fear no evil
[2:11:51] i know i'm going to suffer i know it's
[2:11:53] going to be hard but yet in the midst of
[2:11:55] it i want to really see
[2:11:57] all the details of it
[2:11:59] so i begin to study different lives in
[2:12:01] the bible like job and like joseph
[2:12:03] now i did this for your sakes tonight
[2:12:06] not for my sakes
[2:12:08] not for my sake
[2:12:10] because sometimes there we go through
[2:12:12] trials where it seems like
[2:12:15] the closer we get the further we are
[2:12:17] away
[2:12:19] joseph had a dream
[2:12:21] several dreams actually a couple of
[2:12:22] dreams
[2:12:24] that he saw his family bowing down to
[2:12:26] him
[2:12:28] and he related that to his family
[2:12:30] and and there they were they that's part
[2:12:33] of the thing that made them jealous of
[2:12:35] him especially his brethren here he was
[2:12:38] a a spiritual boy b
[2:12:40] called to be a leader and he was younger
[2:12:42] over them
[2:12:43] and younger than they were and so so
[2:12:45] they became jealous until finally the
[2:12:47] devil anointed that and we know the
[2:12:48] story how he got sold down into egypt
[2:12:50] they threw him in a pit they pulled them
[2:12:52] out of the pit sold them to the
[2:12:53] medianites now he's on a camel or on the
[2:12:55] ground on tied to a rope being walking
[2:12:58] down towards egypt and every day that
[2:13:00] goes by he's getting further away from
[2:13:03] the ones that were in the dream
[2:13:06] all right he believed god
[2:13:08] but it seemed like he was going further
[2:13:10] and further away from it becoming a
[2:13:13] reality
[2:13:15] and so as he got down there into egypt
[2:13:17] you know he thought oh my you know uh
[2:13:20] what am i going to do and and god knows
[2:13:22] how to direct things and he's sold into
[2:13:24] potiphar's house potiphar is the captain
[2:13:26] of the guard of egypt all right so now
[2:13:29] he's a fairly wealthy man and potiphar
[2:13:31] recognizes the gift in another man see
[2:13:33] there's nobody that's successful without
[2:13:35] recognizing the gift in somebody else
[2:13:37] and so he recognizes the gift in joseph
[2:13:40] and he puts him in charge of his whole
[2:13:41] household and so there joseph is
[2:13:43] thinking well
[2:13:44] at least i'm comfortable everything's
[2:13:46] going all right everything looks good so
[2:13:48] he had gone downhill but now it looks
[2:13:50] like things were trending uphill
[2:13:52] and so things are going better now and
[2:13:54] everything's coming together and just as
[2:13:56] everything looks pretty good
[2:13:58] potipher's wife takes a liking to him
[2:14:01] a catastrophe happens
[2:14:04] she she wants to
[2:14:06] commit adultery on her husband with
[2:14:07] joseph
[2:14:09] and joseph runs away from it flees from
[2:14:11] it stays away from it finally one day
[2:14:13] she she's had enough of his resistance
[2:14:15] and she just uh takes the coat that he
[2:14:17] left behind and accuses him of trying to
[2:14:20] do to her what she was trying to do to
[2:14:22] him
[2:14:23] now joseph who was up here gets thrown
[2:14:26] into prison
[2:14:28] not killed but thrown into prison
[2:14:30] now looks like there's no hope he had
[2:14:32] dreams back here
[2:14:34] sent from god
[2:14:36] he's a prophet
[2:14:37] he said your
[2:14:38] your brethren will bow down to you here
[2:14:40] he is in prison
[2:14:42] looks like there's no way it's going to
[2:14:44] come to pass
[2:14:47] there's no way those will ever come to
[2:14:49] pass
[2:14:50] months go by years go by he's in prison
[2:14:52] a long time god knows how to mold a man
[2:14:56] and so there he is in prison
[2:14:58] and finally the the pharaohs butler and
[2:15:01] the baker come you know the story the
[2:15:03] and they have dreams and and joseph
[2:15:05] interprets the dreams for them and the
[2:15:07] and the baker's gonna be killed and the
[2:15:09] butler's gonna be restored then he says
[2:15:10] to the butler he says remember me
[2:15:14] when you get back to pharaoh's house
[2:15:16] and then
[2:15:17] you know know that i did good for you
[2:15:19] and just remember me i don't i mean here
[2:15:21] by a false accusation and the butler
[2:15:23] said no problem joseph i'll remember you
[2:15:26] praise the lord joseph is happy
[2:15:28] ah it's almost over
[2:15:30] hallelujah week goes by
[2:15:34] nothing another week goes by
[2:15:38] nothing
[2:15:39] a month goes by
[2:15:42] nothing
[2:15:44] three months goes by
[2:15:47] nothing
[2:15:49] six months goes by
[2:15:52] god don't you hear me
[2:15:55] nothing's happening
[2:15:57] a year goes by
[2:15:59] oh god don't you know i'm suffering yeah
[2:16:01] he knows you're suffering
[2:16:03] knows exactly what you're going through
[2:16:06] nothing changes
[2:16:08] a year and a half goes by
[2:16:11] nothing
[2:16:12] finally the bible says
[2:16:14] at the end of two
[2:16:16] full years
[2:16:19] the butler remembers oh
[2:16:23] because something triggered his memory
[2:16:26] pharaoh had a dream
[2:16:28] and nobody could interpret it
[2:16:31] and the butler's standing there and
[2:16:33] pharaoh's about to kill all the wise men
[2:16:35] and he and the butler says oh pharaoh
[2:16:37] forgive me i made a terrible mistake
[2:16:40] there was a man in prison and when i was
[2:16:42] there he was used of god to interpret my
[2:16:44] dream and it came to pass
[2:16:46] he says maybe he'll help you so joseph
[2:16:49] after two full years he's in prison and
[2:16:52] everything as far as he is concerned is
[2:16:55] lost
[2:16:57] and then one moment
[2:16:59] he hears his name call
[2:17:03] joseph
[2:17:04] joseph
[2:17:06] we're looking for joseph
[2:17:08] somebody tell me which prisoner is
[2:17:10] joseph oh here's this one right over
[2:17:12] here what do you want joseph are you the
[2:17:15] interpreter of dreams
[2:17:16] oh my something began to change all of a
[2:17:18] sudden
[2:17:20] and in one day
[2:17:22] joseph goes from all hope being lost to
[2:17:25] the right hand of pharaoh
[2:17:29] listen saints it might seem like we've
[2:17:31] been down a wrong a long road it might
[2:17:33] seem like individually you've been down
[2:17:35] a long road but all of a sudden it'll
[2:17:37] turn for you
[2:17:39] that's the kind of god that we serve
[2:17:40] because when he puts you through a trial
[2:17:42] he's preparing you for something
[2:17:48] i had brothers write me when my wife
[2:17:49] passed away
[2:17:50] and they knew of the suddenness of it
[2:17:52] and all that and they said brother tim
[2:17:53] you must be a great man
[2:17:57] oh yeah that's really how i felt
[2:18:02] and they said because god chose you to
[2:18:04] go through such a hard trial
[2:18:07] and and i didn't say that to make you
[2:18:08] think i'm a great man i just said that
[2:18:11] to make you think i think just like you
[2:18:13] do
[2:18:14] i'm not a great man and i don't want
[2:18:16] this trial
[2:18:19] you ever been there
[2:18:21] i'm a nobody and and and what i'm going
[2:18:24] through i'd rather reverse it all
[2:18:27] but yet in the midst of it all god had a
[2:18:30] purpose in it
[2:18:32] and a matter of fact i wouldn't even be
[2:18:34] here today if my wife had not passed
[2:18:36] away i'd have still been the pastor of a
[2:18:39] little church in northern canada as far
[2:18:41] as i know i wouldn't have been here
[2:18:43] because i'd been pastoring i didn't
[2:18:44] travel near as much when i was pastoring
[2:18:46] but it was god's will to change my
[2:18:48] ministry it was god's will to put me
[2:18:50] into a different position and it's god's
[2:18:52] will to take you further than you've
[2:18:55] ever been before
[2:18:57] when job who was a great man
[2:19:00] and had much wealth and much respect and
[2:19:02] much wisdom and all that god had in his
[2:19:04] life but god so loved job he bragged
[2:19:07] about him to the devil
[2:19:09] knowing what the devil's reaction was
[2:19:10] going to be see the devil can't do
[2:19:12] nothing on his own he's just a tool in
[2:19:14] the hand of god to take you through what
[2:19:17] you need to until god comes down and
[2:19:19] says satan just get away i'm done now
[2:19:22] and so god says to the devil as you
[2:19:24] considered my servant job a perfect man
[2:19:27] a man that issue with evil a man that
[2:19:30] loves me
[2:19:31] oh my have you thought about him and the
[2:19:33] devil said sure yeah i thought about him
[2:19:35] because you've got to hedge around about
[2:19:36] him i can't get at him and you know the
[2:19:38] story god allows him but what was the
[2:19:40] purpose in god taking job through all
[2:19:42] that the entire purpose was not for job
[2:19:46] just to be humbled it was for him to
[2:19:48] catch a revelation that he could not
[2:19:51] catch any other way
[2:19:57] the reason you're going through your
[2:19:58] trial
[2:19:59] is because god's bringing a revelation
[2:20:01] to you that you cannot catch any other
[2:20:03] way
[2:20:05] and so which would you rather have
[2:20:07] go back to your life before the trial
[2:20:10] and skip the revelation
[2:20:13] or have the trial and say lord whatever
[2:20:15] revelation you have for me please bring
[2:20:17] it soon
[2:20:19] hallelujah because we've all been there
[2:20:22] and i only share my personal experience
[2:20:24] just to tell you we've all been there
[2:20:27] and i've been through it you've been
[2:20:28] through it but when it comes to the end
[2:20:30] of it there's always something good that
[2:20:32] god has for you
[2:20:40] amen
[2:20:41] but god
[2:20:43] who is rich in mercy
[2:20:46] for his great love
[2:20:48] wherewith he loved us
[2:20:51] oh my
[2:20:53] sometimes
[2:20:55] we don't understand that god thinks so
[2:20:57] much differently than we do
[2:20:59] but god
[2:21:01] when the church looked like a hopeless
[2:21:02] case
[2:21:04] the con the cankerworm the caterpillar
[2:21:06] the palmer worm the locust had eaten the
[2:21:08] church up to nothing in the dark ages
[2:21:11] but god said i will restore saith the
[2:21:14] lord
[2:21:15] it's not what man it's not what the
[2:21:17] outward looks like
[2:21:18] i'll give you a little secret
[2:21:20] can you keep a secret
[2:21:25] that's the way we are isn't it i'll tell
[2:21:26] you a secret but don't tell anybody
[2:21:30] brother biscuit has an expression he
[2:21:31] says
[2:21:32] i've lived by an expression it is what
[2:21:34] it is
[2:21:36] no sense getting upset about it it just
[2:21:37] it is what it is
[2:21:39] so my wife was in the store and she sent
[2:21:40] me a picture of a block of wood just
[2:21:42] like this written on it was it is what
[2:21:44] it is
[2:21:47] and it was just before christmas time
[2:21:48] and so i said buy it
[2:21:51] and she brought it home and i wrapped it
[2:21:53] up just in plain paper and i snuck it
[2:21:54] into the office and i put on brother
[2:21:56] biscuit's desk and i wrote on happy
[2:21:57] birthday and i didn't tell him who it
[2:21:58] was from
[2:21:59] and he doesn't know to this day who it's
[2:22:00] from so don't tell him
[2:22:05] but it is what it is
[2:22:09] it's i thought it was so perfect because
[2:22:10] it's just a block of wood it is what it
[2:22:12] is right
[2:22:13] what is it it is what it is
[2:22:16] sometimes it's that way in our life what
[2:22:18] am i supposed to do with this it is what
[2:22:19] it is
[2:22:21] it's here for some purpose i don't know
[2:22:22] what the purpose is but it is what it is
[2:22:25] praise the lord god knows what he's
[2:22:27] doing when it looked like the devil had
[2:22:29] so perverted christianity but god who is
[2:22:32] rich in mercy said i'm not done yet the
[2:22:35] seed had to fall into the ground and die
[2:22:38] lest it would abide alone and now i'm
[2:22:40] ready to bring my life into
[2:22:42] manifestation
[2:22:43] amen it looked hopeless but god said i
[2:22:46] will restore it's never hopeless
[2:22:48] martha and mary found that out
[2:22:50] as they said lord he's four days dead by
[2:22:53] now he stinks he's so far gone four days
[2:22:56] journey out into eternity but that
[2:22:58] didn't stop god
[2:23:00] but god who is rich in mercy came on the
[2:23:03] scene to show us that nobody is too far
[2:23:06] gone
[2:23:08] amen it doesn't matter how far your
[2:23:10] loved ones are gone it doesn't matter
[2:23:12] what struggles you're having with your
[2:23:14] children i've had eight children and
[2:23:15] i've struggled with them all my life and
[2:23:17] that doesn't mean anything but god who
[2:23:19] is rich in mercy
[2:23:22] for his great love gave me a token that
[2:23:25] i could claim my children say lord i'm
[2:23:27] not letting them go
[2:23:29] the devil cannot have them they are mine
[2:23:32] and they are yours by the grace of god
[2:23:35] but god who is rich in mercy it's never
[2:23:37] too far gone the woman that was caught
[2:23:39] in adultery
[2:23:40] brought her to jesus
[2:23:43] said didn't bring the man i don't know
[2:23:44] why but they brought the woman and you
[2:23:47] know i think we're too hard on the women
[2:23:48] sometimes
[2:23:50] oh sisters that was an easy one to say
[2:23:51] amen to come on
[2:23:54] i think sometimes we're too hard on the
[2:23:56] women
[2:23:57] thank you all right
[2:23:59] and they they they brought
[2:24:02] they brought her to jesus and and
[2:24:03] they're there
[2:24:05] they say you know the word says the law
[2:24:07] says
[2:24:08] she should be stoned
[2:24:11] but here was the love
[2:24:13] that the law was based upon
[2:24:17] all of the law and the prophets hang on
[2:24:19] these two things
[2:24:20] love the lord with all your heart and
[2:24:22] love your neighbor as yourself
[2:24:24] so jesus says to the man
[2:24:27] the second part love her as yourself
[2:24:29] let him that is without sin cast the
[2:24:32] first stone
[2:24:33] if you wouldn't cast a stone at yourself
[2:24:36] then go ahead and cast one at her
[2:24:40] and they one by one jesus stooped down
[2:24:42] wrote in the sand don't know what he
[2:24:43] wrote but
[2:24:44] one by one he's looking at the sand no
[2:24:45] doubt he's seeing the feet around
[2:24:47] disappear one by one one gone another
[2:24:49] one gone another one gone pretty soon
[2:24:50] there's only one set of feet
[2:24:53] and it's the woman
[2:24:54] he lifts up his head he says
[2:24:56] woman
[2:24:57] where are your accusers
[2:25:00] now this is the blood that speaketh
[2:25:02] better things than that of abel
[2:25:05] that's life that was in that blood is in
[2:25:07] me and you
[2:25:09] neither do i condemn you
[2:25:12] go your way and sin no more
[2:25:14] amen what happened like the widow of
[2:25:17] nain that thought that it was over the
[2:25:19] funeral procession was going but it
[2:25:21] happened to go by jesus but god who is
[2:25:24] rich in mercy as jesus stood there and
[2:25:26] the funeral procession goes by and she
[2:25:28] had nobody to take care of her no more
[2:25:30] jesus stopped the funeral procession
[2:25:32] raised the boy from the dead and
[2:25:34] presented him back to his mother why
[2:25:36] because god who is rich in mercy
[2:25:39] amen israel down in egypt looked doomed
[2:25:41] to slavery but god looked down upon them
[2:25:43] saying i have heard their cry
[2:25:46] amen there's only one thing to do in
[2:25:49] your life brother branham says that's
[2:25:50] love the lord your god with all your
[2:25:52] heart with all your soul with all your
[2:25:53] strength with all your mind and believe
[2:25:56] every word that he says is the truth
[2:25:58] truth and love and when you come to the
[2:26:01] end of the road in where you can't go
[2:26:03] any farther
[2:26:05] then divine
[2:26:06] sovereign grace will be projected
[2:26:11] but god who is rich in mercy i'm
[2:26:13] bringing it to a close now there was one
[2:26:14] sister one young girl that was here with
[2:26:16] her mother walking out the other day and
[2:26:18] she said she counted you said you were
[2:26:20] closing five times
[2:26:25] i said i'm about to close
[2:26:28] amen i don't hold it against a little
[2:26:30] girl i think that's perfect you know
[2:26:32] sometimes us ministers need to be
[2:26:33] corrected you know we
[2:26:35] we get speaking a little evangelically
[2:26:38] you know we when not that we stretch it
[2:26:40] but sometimes we say things without
[2:26:41] saying the whole thing
[2:26:43] and and we and we actually don't realize
[2:26:45] that it sounds like a mistake because
[2:26:47] we're not saying the whole thought we
[2:26:49] say a portion and then we don't realize
[2:26:50] what this that portion sounds like by
[2:26:52] itself and so we have to be careful
[2:26:55] all right
[2:26:57] but god who is rich in mercy
[2:27:00] for his great love
[2:27:02] wherewith he loved us
[2:27:04] but god
[2:27:06] who is rich in mercy
[2:27:08] for his agape
[2:27:10] with which he agapod
[2:27:13] us
[2:27:14] the agapettos
[2:27:19] the love
[2:27:21] that he projected to his beloved
[2:27:25] the result produced sovereign grace
[2:27:29] the bride is the definition of beloved
[2:27:35] brother branham says in the latest in
[2:27:37] church age he says now has set forth the
[2:27:39] love of god
[2:27:41] he desired in love a family of his own
[2:27:45] a family of sons
[2:27:47] sons like himself
[2:27:49] there before him lies all mankind is one
[2:27:52] lump of clay
[2:27:53] out of that same lump he will make
[2:27:56] vessels unto honor
[2:27:57] and unto dishonor
[2:27:59] the choosing will be his own choosing
[2:28:02] then those chosen ones born of his
[2:28:04] spirit
[2:28:05] will be trained
[2:28:07] to conform to his image in their walk
[2:28:11] reproves with all long-suffering
[2:28:14] and gentleness
[2:28:16] and mercy
[2:28:18] see when he corrects you it doesn't mean
[2:28:20] he loves you
[2:28:22] charles spurred it doesn't mean he
[2:28:23] doesn't love you i'm sorry that's why
[2:28:25] you didn't say amen to that
[2:28:27] when he when he corrects you it doesn't
[2:28:28] mean he doesn't love you charles
[2:28:30] spurgeon made a statement he says i know
[2:28:32] that god loved me before i was born
[2:28:35] because he would have never loved me
[2:28:36] after i was born
[2:28:41] that's one of those statements put your
[2:28:43] name there
[2:28:45] the way you were the way i was
[2:28:48] reprobate
[2:28:49] walking according to the spirit of
[2:28:51] disobedience but god who is rich in
[2:28:53] mercy amen
[2:28:55] he reproves with all longsuffering and
[2:28:58] gentleness and mercy he chastens with
[2:29:01] nail-scarred hands what was those nail
[2:29:03] scars done by his love
[2:29:06] see his love is eternal i i just feel i
[2:29:09] got to just nail this down as we come to
[2:29:11] a close and as his love is eternal and
[2:29:13] do you realize eternal means without
[2:29:15] beginning without end but it also means
[2:29:17] without a break
[2:29:20] so if he if he ever loved you he always
[2:29:22] will love you and always has loved you
[2:29:25] then that means if your name was written
[2:29:26] on the land's book of life before the
[2:29:28] foundation of the world know what no
[2:29:30] matter what you did
[2:29:32] it never stopped god's love for you
[2:29:38] he may chasten you he may reprove you he
[2:29:40] may correct you as he does as a father
[2:29:42] does the son in whom he delighteth but
[2:29:45] it will never stop his love you cannot
[2:29:48] stop the love of god
[2:29:51] amen no wonder the apostle paul could
[2:29:52] speak by revelation at the end of romans
[2:29:55] 8 and say i am persuaded
[2:29:57] that neither depth nor height
[2:30:00] nor principality nor power nor
[2:30:02] persecution nor tribulation nor things
[2:30:05] present nor things to come nor anything
[2:30:07] shall be able to separate us from the
[2:30:10] love of god that's in christ jesus
[2:30:13] amen and when peter rejected christ
[2:30:15] three times and run away and says i'm
[2:30:17] going to go back to fishing i'm done
[2:30:19] with the message
[2:30:21] i'm totally done this message is falling
[2:30:23] apart at the seams the leader's been
[2:30:24] killed and everything's happening i'm
[2:30:26] just going fishing and forget about it
[2:30:28] now don't ever talk to me about this
[2:30:29] message ever again jesus comes yes
[2:30:33] and what does he say peter lovest thou
[2:30:36] me
[2:30:37] hallelujah
[2:30:39] he knew he did
[2:30:41] yes lord you know i love you
[2:30:43] peter lovett thou me
[2:30:45] wasn't a deep question was it
[2:30:47] peter do you understand the mysteries of
[2:30:49] the seven angels that are in my right
[2:30:50] hand and the seven seals and the seven
[2:30:52] church ages the seven vows and the seven
[2:30:54] plagues and the seven trumpets and all
[2:30:56] of those kind of things and how to place
[2:30:57] it can you draw me a timeline like some
[2:30:59] of us brother's canon can you place it
[2:31:00] all to you no he says peter do you love
[2:31:02] me
[2:31:04] do you love me peter lord you know i
[2:31:06] love you
[2:31:08] peter do you love me
[2:31:11] that was the question
[2:31:13] sometimes god has to keep coming back
[2:31:15] but don't you love me
[2:31:17] lord i'm going through all this but
[2:31:19] don't you love me
[2:31:21] lord i'm really suffering now but don't
[2:31:23] you love me
[2:31:24] lord i don't understand these things are
[2:31:26] happening but don't you love me
[2:31:28] lord there's so many things that are
[2:31:29] taking but don't you love me
[2:31:31] because i'll tell you what i sure love
[2:31:33] you
[2:31:35] hallelujah
[2:31:37] god speaks back he says i love you
[2:31:39] that's why my chasing is with nail
[2:31:41] scarred hands
[2:31:42] that's why my my yoke is easy and my
[2:31:44] burden is light
[2:31:46] brother branham goes sometimes the
[2:31:47] potter must take the vessel he is
[2:31:49] working on and thoroughly break it down
[2:31:52] in order that he might rebuild it
[2:31:54] exactly as he desires it
[2:31:57] but it is love
[2:32:01] that is his love
[2:32:04] another way of love there is not
[2:32:08] and there cannot be
[2:32:10] hallelujah that's god
[2:32:17] the bride is his beloved
[2:32:21] the word beloved appears in lots of
[2:32:23] places in the bible
[2:32:24] a few times in many different books i
[2:32:26] think seven times in the book of romans
[2:32:29] but the place where it appears most
[2:32:32] is in the song solomon
[2:32:33] or the song of songs
[2:32:35] 26 times
[2:32:38] what is it
[2:32:41] think about it now song of solomon is
[2:32:42] something that we don't preach on a lot
[2:32:44] we don't talk about a lot you know it
[2:32:46] seems like
[2:32:47] almost
[2:32:48] this intimate personal relationship
[2:32:50] between a man and a woman there that
[2:32:52] that becomes so intimate they begin to
[2:32:54] describe
[2:32:56] i'll just say parts of the body that we
[2:32:57] don't like to touch
[2:32:59] don't like to talk about and as far as
[2:33:01] in the ministers and that sort of thing
[2:33:03] and i'm not going to go down that road
[2:33:04] but yet in the midst of it all
[2:33:07] god is describing a love that is so
[2:33:10] intimate and personal that he has for
[2:33:12] you
[2:33:14] that he's acquainted with every part of
[2:33:16] your life
[2:33:19] and he loves you
[2:33:21] he knows you're just a man he knows
[2:33:23] you're just a woman
[2:33:25] he knows exactly what you're going to go
[2:33:27] through he knows the mistakes you're
[2:33:28] going to make
[2:33:31] he knows your weaker parts he knows your
[2:33:34] hidden parts see when it talks about the
[2:33:36] intimacy of the body is talking about
[2:33:38] the parts what the bible says we clothe
[2:33:40] upon that receive more c more abundant
[2:33:42] honor because we're ashamed of them
[2:33:46] what is that there's areas of our life
[2:33:48] that we keep covered up
[2:33:50] there's areas of our life we don't want
[2:33:51] nobody to know about but god is saying
[2:33:54] in his love story i know all about them
[2:33:56] and i still love you
[2:34:00] hallelujah you are my beloved
[2:34:04] you are the one that i knew exactly what
[2:34:07] kind of a condition you went and you'd
[2:34:08] lay on your face and say lord i hate the
[2:34:10] way i am i hate them i have this
[2:34:13] weakness i hate god says i knew you had
[2:34:15] that and i loved you anyway
[2:34:18] amen
[2:34:21] god come down and say it doesn't matter
[2:34:24] it doesn't make no difference in a
[2:34:26] matter of fact it's because of those
[2:34:27] things that i bestow on you more
[2:34:29] abundant honor
[2:34:31] i bestow on you more abundant grace
[2:34:34] i bestow on you more abundant love
[2:34:37] because you are mine and no one else do
[2:34:39] i desire
[2:34:42] hallelujah
[2:34:44] so the bible records in solomon's he
[2:34:46] says
[2:34:48] the woman says i am my beloveds
[2:34:51] and my beloved is mine
[2:34:55] i am my beloveds and my beloved is mine
[2:34:58] i am his and he is mine what a
[2:35:00] relationship she goes throughout the
[2:35:02] city she begins to wonder you know where
[2:35:04] have you seen him i i just want to be
[2:35:06] with him i don't really care what else
[2:35:08] is going on in the city i don't care
[2:35:09] what watch it is i don't care what's
[2:35:11] happening on the walls i don't care the
[2:35:13] people that are in the streets i don't
[2:35:15] care about anything else i just care
[2:35:17] about him
[2:35:20] there's something in my heart that says
[2:35:22] just give me more of jesus
[2:35:26] all i want to see
[2:35:28] is jesus
[2:35:32] and she loves his voice
[2:35:34] oh we've received his voice
[2:35:36] the voice of my
[2:35:38] beloved behold he quickly come he cometh
[2:35:42] leaping upon the mountains skipping upon
[2:35:44] the hills he's coming
[2:35:47] i've heard his voice
[2:35:49] it come in a message
[2:35:51] it told me he's coming
[2:35:53] he told me i'm in the midst of his
[2:35:55] coming
[2:35:56] the voice caused me to recognize he's
[2:35:58] coming he's leaping upon the mountains
[2:36:00] right now
[2:36:01] amen he's skipping upon the hills my
[2:36:04] beloved is like a row and a young heart
[2:36:06] behold he standeth behind our wall
[2:36:09] he looketh forth at the windows he
[2:36:11] showeth himself through the lattice you
[2:36:13] know sometimes i can't see a clear
[2:36:15] vision of him but i know he's there
[2:36:18] i can hear his voice
[2:36:20] i look at him through the word i don't
[2:36:21] necessarily understand it all i don't
[2:36:24] see him quite clearly but i hear his
[2:36:25] voice
[2:36:27] he speaks to me from the word
[2:36:29] he makes known himself to me that's my
[2:36:31] beloved
[2:36:33] my beloved spake oh i love this part and
[2:36:35] i'm going to close on this my beloved
[2:36:37] spake and said unto me the words that we
[2:36:40] are waiting to hear
[2:36:42] the words that are laying right within
[2:36:44] the word and they're becoming louder
[2:36:46] and they're becoming louder
[2:36:48] and they're becoming louder like the
[2:36:49] voice on the mountain and the trumpet
[2:36:52] growing louder and louder a trumpet at
[2:36:54] the last trump
[2:36:56] growing louder and growing louder he
[2:36:58] says my beloved spake and he said unto
[2:36:59] me
[2:37:00] rise up my love
[2:37:03] my fair one
[2:37:05] and come away
[2:37:08] what is that the voice of the
[2:37:09] resurrection
[2:37:11] arise lazarus we hadn't said lazarus
[2:37:14] everyone in the grave would have risen
[2:37:17] it's the same voice of our beloved that
[2:37:19] says rise up my love
[2:37:22] rise up my fair one and come away to the
[2:37:24] wedding supper come away to a feast with
[2:37:28] me
[2:37:29] hallelujah for lo the winter is past the
[2:37:31] rain is over
[2:37:33] hallelujah
[2:37:34] the hard season is done
[2:37:37] we're here amen the flowers are appear
[2:37:40] upon the earth
[2:37:42] the time of the singing of birds has
[2:37:44] come
[2:37:46] and the voice of the turtle dove is
[2:37:47] heard in our land
[2:37:49] it says voice of the turtle but turtles
[2:37:50] don't have a voice it's actually
[2:37:52] turtledove
[2:37:53] the fig tree putteth forth her green
[2:37:55] figs what is that israel
[2:37:57] we see the time the season the vines
[2:37:59] with the tender grapes give a good smell
[2:38:02] and he says at the end of this arise my
[2:38:04] love
[2:38:06] my fair one come away
[2:38:11] hallelujah
[2:38:13] it was love
[2:38:15] the purity
[2:38:16] of it in god
[2:38:19] that made him slip the wedding band of
[2:38:21] predestinated unmerited grace
[2:38:24] upon your finger before the foundation
[2:38:27] of the world
[2:38:28] he always knew that we were his
[2:38:34] and when you always know that somebody
[2:38:36] was yours
[2:38:38] you have grace for everything they go
[2:38:40] through
[2:38:44] sometimes god will reveal to one
[2:38:46] part of the couple the future marriage
[2:38:49] relationship before the other
[2:38:52] but when you know god has spoken to you
[2:38:55] you say i can wait
[2:38:57] god has spoken to me that one's mine
[2:39:00] i don't need to say nothing
[2:39:02] i don't need to push it
[2:39:04] all i got to do is wait for them to get
[2:39:06] a revelation
[2:39:07] amen and so is with god he slipped the
[2:39:10] wedding band of predestinated unmerited
[2:39:12] grace on your finger
[2:39:14] when you come into this world as a child
[2:39:16] he says that one's mine
[2:39:18] that one's mine
[2:39:20] that one's mine
[2:39:21] you didn't understand it you went your
[2:39:23] way you followed the things of the world
[2:39:25] you pursued the lust of the flesh and
[2:39:27] the desire the lust of the eyes and the
[2:39:29] pride of life and all of those kind of
[2:39:30] things that you desired and you went off
[2:39:32] your own way but god didn't care
[2:39:35] there'll come a time that one's mine
[2:39:38] hallelujah they'll get the revelation
[2:39:41] they might not understand it right now
[2:39:43] they got spiritual amnesia and they
[2:39:44] might go through a lot of things they
[2:39:46] might even put themselves through things
[2:39:47] because i'm kind of i'm kind of wooing
[2:39:49] them
[2:39:49] i'm kind of pricking their heart like i
[2:39:51] did paul on the road on to damascus or
[2:39:53] even before the road to damascus i might
[2:39:55] have to knock them down like i did paul
[2:39:57] on the road to damascus and bring their
[2:39:59] attention to who they really are
[2:40:01] but they're mine
[2:40:04] and when they find out their mind
[2:40:07] amen then they will love my voice
[2:40:11] and now they'll begin to hear my voice
[2:40:13] that says through a messenger
[2:40:16] the voice
[2:40:17] the the wedding call
[2:40:20] the midnight call
[2:40:22] arise
[2:40:24] trim your lamps

[2:40:28] amen i want to hear his voice
[2:40:32] i want to hear him say arise my love
[2:40:36] arise my fair one
[2:40:38] and come away as the musicians come

[2:48:00] i pray
[2:48:03] no one else has ever cared for me yes
[2:48:08] lord

[2:49:32] through your precious
[2:49:45] we're all
[2:49:47] washed away
[2:49:59] but god
[2:50:01] you might have been
[2:50:03] at a point in your life there was one
[2:50:04] brother shared his testimony with me at
[2:50:06] breakfast you've been going through a
[2:50:08] lot of physical infirmities a lot of
[2:50:09] disruption in his life
[2:50:11] but god knew you needed this campaign
[2:50:15] you might have had trials you might have
[2:50:17] had issues
[2:50:18] you might have even been doing okay
[2:50:21] but god knew he wanted to meet you here
[2:50:24] god wanted to pull you aside
[2:50:27] so that he could tell you how much he
[2:50:29] loves you
[2:50:31] and don't ever fear
[2:50:33] what the devil will try and throw in
[2:50:34] your mind and bombard you with it's not
[2:50:37] about doctrine and it's not about
[2:50:40] understanding everything listen i don't
[2:50:42] understand everything matter of fact if
[2:50:44] you understood everything you wouldn't
[2:50:45] need faith
[2:50:48] you got this gospel is by faith
[2:50:51] but it's about being honest and being
[2:50:54] real with god
[2:50:56] being real not with me with god not your
[2:50:59] husband not your wife with god not the
[2:51:01] pastor not the church the deacons the
[2:51:03] trustees and musicians whatever it might
[2:51:05] be be real with god because god is real
[2:51:10] just say god i don't understand
[2:51:12] everything but if you'll make yourself
[2:51:14] real to me
[2:51:16] and if you'll show your love to me i
[2:51:18] give you my entire life
[2:51:26] we preached about
[2:51:28] the first day we talked about death and
[2:51:31] hell is all around you
[2:51:33] but god came in the midst of that and we
[2:51:35] love him anyway
[2:51:37] we talked about
[2:51:39] how that
[2:51:41] you know here we are in these last days
[2:51:44] god's given us
[2:51:47] his name
[2:51:48] and what's in a name and what it means
[2:51:50] to be his son
[2:51:51] and what it means to be a bride
[2:51:53] and all the things that go with us and
[2:51:55] what our attitude ought to be towards
[2:51:56] our inheritance
[2:51:58] and all the revelation that god's poured
[2:51:59] into our life it ought to be an extreme
[2:52:01] joy
[2:52:03] but then this morning just just to tie
[2:52:05] it together
[2:52:07] it is really all his love
[2:52:10] and because his love is all-powerful
[2:52:13] you couldn't resist it anyway
[2:52:17] it made the universe what made you think
[2:52:19] is not going to conquer you
[2:52:22] are you so tough that you can resist the
[2:52:24] love of god
[2:52:25] let me tell you something
[2:52:27] galaxies there's 100 billion galaxies
[2:52:30] and there's 10 billion stars in each
[2:52:32] galaxy
[2:52:34] and so there's a billion trillion stars
[2:52:36] out there and god made them all
[2:52:38] he was writing his word he was writing
[2:52:40] his love story and it tells a story in
[2:52:43] the heavens
[2:52:45] but the purpose of it is god's love and
[2:52:48] as his love did all that
[2:52:50] his love will conquer you
[2:52:53] if you just let it
[2:52:55] bow our heads together
[2:53:00] it's the last time we'll pray together
[2:53:03] here we are at the end of the service
[2:53:05] about to turn it back to brother ben
[2:53:07] close the meetings
[2:53:10] if there's anybody here still that would
[2:53:12] say oh god
[2:53:15] my heart's posse
[2:53:17] i don't know that i believe it but
[2:53:19] something inside is telling me i want it
[2:53:22] i want you to make yourself real to me
[2:53:25] i want you lord to do something for me
[2:53:29] it might not be at this meeting it might
[2:53:31] be in the days ahead
[2:53:32] but i want you to know lord i love you
[2:53:36] and i'll serve you every day of my life
[2:53:39] and i just welcome you to make yourself
[2:53:41] real to me in a way that you've never
[2:53:43] made yourself real to me before
[2:53:45] you might just want to slip up a hand to
[2:53:47] him
[2:53:48] i'm not even going to
[2:53:50] acknowledge those hands i'll just say
[2:53:52] lord knows whose hands are raised
[2:53:54] and whose isn't

[2:54:14] in the days ahead if you would terry

[2:54:29] midst oh god
