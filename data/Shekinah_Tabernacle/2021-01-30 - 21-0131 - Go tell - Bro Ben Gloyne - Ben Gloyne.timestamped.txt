[10:08] opportunity to be able to um
[10:10] worship the lord this morning and this
[10:12] morning we're gonna
[10:13] give him everything that we have we're
[10:16] gonna leave
[10:17] leave we're not going to we're not just
[10:19] going to have to do a half-hearted
[10:20] approach but we're going to give god our
[10:22] all this morning amen
[10:23] because that's how we you know we i
[10:26] guess we reap what we say
[10:28] the more we put in the more we get out
[10:29] you know that's the way it is with the
[10:30] lord he's always willing it's always
[10:33] it's always us that seem to hold the
[10:34] show up but you know
[10:36] may our spirit be willing and may our
[10:37] flesh be willing this morning
[10:39] well our flesh is never really willing
[10:40] but as brother and he says we're just
[10:42] going to make it
[10:43] do as it's told subdue it amen that's
[10:46] [Music]
[10:48] you read a lot of self-help christian
[10:50] books that give you seven steps to
[10:52] control the flesh to train the flesh but
[10:55] it doesn't quite work like that
[10:58] the only way is subjection amen let's um
[11:00] stand this morning and let's commit the
[11:02] service to the lord
[11:04] invite him to be here i'm going to ask
[11:06] brother anyas do you want to open them
[11:08] prayer for us this morning brother you
[11:09] can come up here and
[11:11] open them prayer
[11:14] [Music]
[11:20] [Music]
[11:24] amen most holy and
[11:27] heavenly father we want to thank you for
[11:29] this mighty opportunity to be
[11:31] in this house father god this morning
[11:35] heavenly father i think of gatherings
[11:37] this morning
[11:38] so many people are gathered today some
[11:40] are gathered for games
[11:43] for different things all throughout the
[11:44] world oh god
[11:46] but there is a little group father god
[11:48] in wellington today
[11:50] if people come here and count the
[11:52] numbers
[11:53] and we tell them we are the
[11:55] representatives of the mighty god
[11:57] they would doubt us because they say
[11:59] really if
[12:01] you truly are the representatives of the
[12:03] mighty god
[12:04] why are you so few i think of that same
[12:07] one that the prophet preached
[12:09] one in a million how for all those men
[12:12] that left
[12:13] egypt and went to the promised land only
[12:16] two men
[12:17] joshua and caleb entered that land
[12:20] because the rest of the people were just
[12:22] fighting moses
[12:24] they saw the miracles in egypt but they
[12:26] didn't believe them
[12:27] they proved to be unbelievers praise
[12:30] yourself any father
[12:31] it's such an honor a great privilege
[12:34] just to be in this place to be standing
[12:37] where we are
[12:38] believing this message of the hour
[12:40] appreciating you father god
[12:43] for showing us your own word means so
[12:46] much to you
[12:47] when you spoke it in malachi 4 it took
[12:50] hundreds of years
[12:51] but that way they had to come to pass
[12:54] because lord
[12:55] we have the pictures we've got the
[12:56] pillar of fire in our midst
[12:58] today in might and eternal god you
[13:01] know what your children desire this
[13:04] morning
[13:05] did you say in that word the day will
[13:07] come
[13:08] where even before they speak it i will
[13:11] hear their thoughts
[13:12] and i will grant their desires might and
[13:15] eternal god may you bless
[13:16] every brother and every sister who is in
[13:19] this place
[13:20] may you bless our song leader here
[13:22] father god
[13:24] inspires him father god to grant her to
[13:26] lead us in the right songs
[13:28] that will bring down the anointing of
[13:30] the holy ghost in this place
[13:32] may you bless our officers every brother
[13:34] and every sister

[35:53] hallelujah well
[35:57] by the lord's leading i believe
[36:00] the lord has um given us an opportunity
[36:04] to really bring um we're gonna
[36:08] this year is gonna be different for our
[36:10] youth and eagles
[36:12] and adult youth to get involved in a
[36:15] program
[36:16] that is a program and as definitive as
[36:19] the lord leads
[36:20] and so i just want to take you through i
[36:22] can't spend too much time so
[36:24] basically what we've got here is an
[36:26] overview but first before i get into i
[36:28] just want to
[36:29] is this going to work
[36:34] there we go yep so is that the first one
[36:38] is that slide one so
[36:41] first of all i'm just gonna cover this
[36:43] real fast so
[36:45] i need everybody okay are we all on
[36:48] board
[36:49] is everyone with me amen there's
[36:52] mechanics that need to take place
[36:54] that means you have to put not now but
[36:56] pull out your phones
[36:58] and download google calendar please we
[37:00] need a download google calendar
[37:02] and turn it on and link it to the
[37:04] shekinah tabernacle if you need help
[37:07] someone here i can help you
[37:09] or anyone that's kind of under the age
[37:11] of
[37:12] 30 or can help you
[37:15] okay amen
[37:18] so this is the process and you can
[37:22] refer to this if you want to but
[37:24] basically download the app
[37:26] on either apple or android look and
[37:29] on your computer too if you've got a
[37:31] desktop or a laptop download google
[37:32] calendar and lincoln to shekinah
[37:34] tabernacle
[37:35] look in your email for an invite to
[37:37] shekinah tabernacle
[37:38] i've got everybody's email in here i
[37:40] believe and if i haven't got your email
[37:43] please tell me and if i've got your
[37:45] email that isn't gmail
[37:46] then please tell me because i need your
[37:49] email to be gmail
[37:52] so that it links to gcalendar amen so
[37:55] please oh i've got a list i've got it on
[37:57] my phone after church
[37:59] if you're not getting notifications and
[38:01] you're on google calendar it's probably
[38:03] because you're not linked
[38:04] to the gmail so we could help you set up
[38:06] an email or whatever
[38:08] but it's very important these mechanics
[38:10] are very important
[38:11] for us to be part of a group so that the
[38:14] dynamics can come
[38:15] but we're just this is just to send us
[38:17] reminders okay
[38:18] so and then we want to book this is this
[38:21] is here key
[38:22] we need help because you see if we just
[38:25] let it go
[38:26] it'll just go because the law there is a
[38:29] law of thermodynamics that
[38:31] if you don't put energy into something
[38:32] it will degrade
[38:34] and the devil will make sure it degrades
[38:37] so you need to put
[38:38] physical and spiritual energy and heart
[38:41] and care into it so that it builds up
[38:45] and you can put a little bit and it
[38:47] might just stay like that
[38:48] but the chances are it will go down but
[38:51] if we put our
[38:52] effort everything into it if we put our
[38:54] mechanics into it
[38:55] and that's why i put here book your the
[38:58] whole year's plan everything's planned
[39:01] now the details aren't planned and i'll
[39:02] get to that in a minute but the whole
[39:04] year
[39:04] is planned all the dates are set
[39:08] lord willing okay we don't want to say
[39:10] it's all set and then that's it
[39:12] because we want to be flexible but from
[39:15] our perspective
[39:16] mechanically humanly it's set
[39:20] amen and so now that the luxury of that
[39:23] is
[39:24] you can plan around it okay so that
[39:27] means no holidays when these dates are
[39:29] on
[39:30] no family trips no going away and
[39:33] anywhere this is
[39:34] this is this is number one
[39:37] you can do whatever you feel to do but
[39:40] i'm just saying
[39:42] now we don't have any excuse to plan
[39:45] when the youth things are on or when
[39:46] this is on
[39:47] because it's all there and this is the
[39:49] beauty of it and this is the burden
[39:51] that we could plan because there's still
[39:53] lots of space there's still lots of
[39:54] holiday room and lots of weekends to go
[39:56] and do your own thing as a family
[39:58] but then there's weekends we do things
[40:00] with this family amen
[40:02] and i believe that when this family gets
[40:04] real good
[40:05] we're going home amen so let's get this
[40:07] family real good
[40:09] hallelujah are you with me i want to
[40:11] rally that point
[40:13] on a rally that are we together amen
[40:16] hallelujah
[40:17] well i'm going to go fast now
[40:19] expectation
[40:20] so number one i'm not going to i'm not
[40:22] going to explain these things i just
[40:23] want you to
[40:24] you know and people on that camera that
[40:25] might not be here i'm looking at you too
[40:29] no one in particular but you know some
[40:31] people are hiding in their little
[40:32] office there somewhere overseas or
[40:34] somewhere or somewhere in new zealand
[40:36] and they really want to be part of this
[40:38] you're a part of this amen
[40:41] are you zooming in i'm i'm i'm laser
[40:44] pointing that camera right now
[40:47] you action we need action
[40:52] we need buy-in amen hallelujah
[40:55] accountability and commitment amen
[40:59] if you see that you you feel like you're
[41:01] doing something
[41:02] but you feel like oh my friends because
[41:04] you know we have our close friends and
[41:05] close connections
[41:06] hit them up hit them up what are you
[41:09] doing
[41:10] let's make each other accountable
[41:12] because this is important
[41:14] i've seen now this i've seen
[41:17] man i watched some videos of our church
[41:19] services after youth camp
[41:20] and all of our young people were just
[41:23] rejoicing in the services standing up
[41:25] and shouting
[41:26] and now they just get down and they
[41:28] start getting quiet and things start to
[41:30] panel why
[41:31] why because we need a rally we need to
[41:34] continue the revival
[41:36] you don't have to go down and start
[41:37] sitting still and getting down and
[41:40] getting oppressed by the devil and all
[41:41] those things
[41:42] you can stay in revival all of us can
[41:44] stay in revival
[41:46] and this is going to take this is the
[41:48] burden action
[41:49] accountability commitment we need
[41:52] commitment from people
[41:53] we need cohesion and an effort so this
[41:56] is going to take these things
[41:58] remember the one main thing that we need
[42:00] is the lord but what we've got to do is
[42:03] we've got to give him something to work
[42:04] with
[42:05] hallelujah so we don't want to forget
[42:07] the key of this all is that god comes
[42:10] amen hallelujah process for event
[42:13] planning so this is the process now
[42:15] because we don't want to just take over
[42:16] this whole thing
[42:17] we've got young adults that really want
[42:19] to get involved people that want to help
[42:21] with these things and help planning
[42:23] so what we've done is we've got the
[42:24] dates all set
[42:26] but then the pre-planning with the adult
[42:28] youth and those that want to get
[42:29] involved in leadership and
[42:30] actually be part of the planning the
[42:33] details of each
[42:34] event and each youth catch up at each
[42:36] eagle fun night and all those things
[42:39] have been left as an open canvas and
[42:41] we've got reminders coming this is why
[42:43] it's important that we get google
[42:44] calendar
[42:45] we've got reminders coming like uh a day
[42:47] out
[42:48] two weeks out and then a month out on
[42:51] the major ones
[42:52] so that we can at the month out we're
[42:53] going to gather together and we're going
[42:54] to plan
[42:55] with the young adults and the youth the
[42:57] ones that want to get involved
[42:59] and i believe we should all get involved
[43:00] we should be involved because you see
[43:02] the more we come together the more we do
[43:04] these things the more cohesion we have
[43:06] the more friendships are forged all
[43:08] right
[43:09] so date set pre-planning with adult
[43:12] youth and then we execute it we carry it
[43:14] out we go and do it
[43:16] amen i'm going to hand these out
[43:19] these are going to be handed out to the
[43:22] parents and the young
[43:23] people the youth not the eagle sorry
[43:26] you'll get there
[43:28] i think in a couple of years but this is
[43:30] for the senior youth class
[43:32] and the adult youth and also for the
[43:35] parents
[43:36] of the of those people in those classes
[43:38] so that we can all be on board
[43:40] with the with what's happening this in
[43:42] here as you probably can't read
[43:44] because i can't even read it from here
[43:46] is basically the agenda
[43:48] um this is to help you can stick this on
[43:51] your fridge
[43:52] and make uh appointments right around
[43:55] here
[43:56] so we've got um you can actually book
[43:58] these things into your calendar or i
[44:00] mean it's booked for you
[44:01] you don't have to do anything really as
[44:03] long as you sign in
[44:05] it's all done then and what we could do
[44:09] is we could have a planner
[44:10] that has nothing in it where there is
[44:12] nothing on and then you can
[44:13] plan that if that works i know we can do
[44:17] anything to make it easy
[44:18] we just want to make this real
[44:20] streamlined real easy so that it's just
[44:22] it just works and it is going to be hard
[44:24] work
[44:25] and it but it's not like a terrible
[44:27] regime or anything this is actually
[44:28] going to be quite fun
[44:32] january february so we've got the dates
[44:34] there so when you get this little
[44:35] leaflet thing here
[44:37] you'll have the dates of what it is just
[44:40] explaining
[44:40] it and then in here is some more
[44:44] information
[44:44] which i have over here
[44:49] you can see um we've got the dates and
[44:53] the times of each of these different
[44:55] events for the youth okay so the details
[44:58] of that can go into that if you want to
[45:00] talk about it anytime
[45:01] we're here to explain the details
[45:05] in here please when you get this can you
[45:07] please read that
[45:08] that is that's like the the mission
[45:10] statement
[45:11] for want of a better word amen
[45:16] so
[45:23] now here
[45:26] is the program all the red is church
[45:30] so don't get too worried
[45:34] i said to brahman we should we probably
[45:36] shouldn't have put the church
[45:38] meetings on there because now it looks
[45:39] like it's like completely full you know
[45:42] but that is that is the program um
[45:45] so basically this and this will go up
[45:49] on the notice board out on the wall
[45:50] there but this is to give you an idea of
[45:52] what's in google calendar
[45:54] the blue is the eagles little meetings
[45:56] and catch-ups
[45:58] um the green is the youth events there
[46:00] is uh one major event we haven't put in
[46:02] there yet because
[46:03] um um like you know when taranaki came
[46:07] down
[46:07] and we had that awesome weekend that's
[46:10] called the youth bonanza and that's
[46:11] right there
[46:12] we want to do two of them in a year we
[46:14] want to do one there where they come
[46:15] down and then we're going to go there or
[46:17] we're going to go somewhere
[46:18] but we've also got another major youth
[46:20] event which is the
[46:22] youth retreat weekend where we're going
[46:24] to go into the
[46:25] snow and stay up in tongariro camp and
[46:27] things like that so it's going to be
[46:28] real fun
[46:29] and then yeah we've got a whole bunch of
[46:32] programs for the eagles and
[46:33] for the youth and so
[46:37] yes this is going to be a it's not too
[46:40] busy it looks busy but it's not too busy
[46:42] but it's
[46:43] we just need to come together we just
[46:44] need to see this thing unfold
[46:46] and the awesome thing is now that it's
[46:48] all set we don't have to
[46:50] you know we don't have to have things
[46:51] that are coinciding unless it's
[46:52] obviously coming up
[46:54] um and it's you know like something that
[46:56] just comes up out of unforeseen
[46:58] but um the awesome thing is now we can
[47:00] incorporate the
[47:01] the adult youth and the young people
[47:02] that really want to get involved and we
[47:04] can do this together
[47:05] now for the eagles there is and brother
[47:08] and paul
[47:09] is do you want to have that meeting
[47:10] after the church about the production
[47:12] yeah okay so eagles please meet after
[47:16] church
[47:16] with brother and paul straight up just
[47:18] for a quick meeting regarding an eagle
[47:20] production
[47:22] there's going to be two productions each
[47:23] year
[47:25] so two per year one's going to be ready
[47:28] of
[47:29] ready rehearsed and ready by mother's
[47:31] day which is
[47:33] oh mate may
[47:36] yeah and then the other one's for church
[47:37] camp so i believe there'll be a real
[47:39] blessing
[47:40] and there's going to have the way it
[47:43] works is this three months of rehearsals
[47:45] which are going to happen kind of around
[47:47] when band practice is happening
[47:49] um just after lunch
[47:52] so don't get worried eagles you can eat
[47:54] first
[47:55] two-month break and then um so there'll
[47:58] be and then it'll be all on again so
[48:00] three months of rehearsals two months
[48:02] and then a production two-month break
[48:03] and then it'll be the same repeating
[48:05] so you do it's not going to be all year
[48:07] rehearsals every week
[48:09] but we've planned these things and tried
[48:11] our best so that
[48:12] it avoids big traveling it's like we're
[48:14] trying to incorporate these to before
[48:15] and after services
[48:16] but there is inevitably going to be some
[48:18] traveling involved for some of the
[48:20] friday night meetings
[48:21] but what we've done is we've made the
[48:23] friday night youth meetings
[48:25] simultaneous to the eagle meetings so
[48:27] they will happen simultaneously
[48:29] every now and again they will come
[48:31] together i was thinking that we can do
[48:33] the
[48:33] there is an actual youth casual meetup
[48:35] and an eagles meet up on november the
[48:37] 5th which is guy fawkes
[48:38] so we can then have a fireworks night
[48:41] together and do something fun so
[48:42] we can do that together midweek workshop
[48:45] so isaac
[48:46] um you have probably not known about
[48:48] this yet but we're going to be getting
[48:50] brother isaac to take some workshops
[48:52] with the eagles
[48:53] who will get to come to church on
[48:56] wednesday nights
[48:58] at 6 pm and they get to jump on their
[49:01] favorite instrument
[49:02] and not smash it but just have a good
[49:04] time
[49:05] and hit it real good and brother isaac
[49:07] or myself or anyone else that would like
[49:09] to just
[49:10] facilitate that and maybe write a couple
[49:13] of songs with them and just have fun
[49:15] this is because we've had requests to do
[49:17] that so
[49:18] that's one of the things that we want to
[49:20] do and we're going to be doing that
[49:22] every once every month on a wednesday
[49:26] night at 6 pm the big day for the eagles
[49:30] to plan
[49:30] that is 2bc but we'll talk about that
[49:34] and we'll let sister shannon
[49:35] and brother and paul fill in the details
[49:37] for the eagles
[49:39] and fun nights are going to be every
[49:41] monthly on a friday
[49:43] and then obviously there is nothing
[49:46] stopping you guys
[49:48] um having fun together in between
[49:51] amen hallelujah so
[49:55] after service can we please have all of
[49:57] the youth and anyone that identifies
[49:59] themselves as youth

[50:31] effort but i believe that it will pay

[57:50] and they said among themselves who shall
[57:52] roll us away the stone from the door of
[57:54] the sepulchre
[57:55] and when they looked they saw that the
[57:57] stone was rolled away
[57:59] for it was very great and
[58:02] entering into the sepulchre they saw a
[58:03] young man sitting on the right side
[58:05] clothed with a long white garment
[58:08] and they were refrighted and he saith
[58:10] unto them be not afraid

[58:30] you
[58:31] and they went they went out quickly and
[58:34] fled from the sepulcher

[59:22] unstable things can be

[1:00:18] amen amen god bless you friends you may
[1:00:20] have your seats this morning i want to
[1:00:22] if i could take this take a title today
[1:00:26] i want to talk about go
[1:00:27] tell um and you know i was listening to
[1:00:31] brother brown speaking about this we
[1:00:32] know this is like you know he preaches
[1:00:34] as an easter
[1:00:35] easter sunrise service but to me it's
[1:00:37] the most powerful instruction
[1:00:39] that a people can be given by almighty
[1:00:40] god go tell
[1:00:42] i'm alive and we're so thankful that
[1:00:44] it's not just a
[1:00:45] uh we don't just go tell people that he
[1:00:47] lives because of tradition because of
[1:00:49] history because
[1:00:50] you know but because he's a living god
[1:00:52] in our lives we have something to run
[1:00:54] with
[1:00:54] brother brown would say that many people
[1:00:56] are running today but they don't have a
[1:00:58] message to pack you know they go here
[1:00:59] and there and they preach things and
[1:01:01] they have conventions they have meetings
[1:01:02] they build churches but
[1:01:03] they don't have the message that he is
[1:01:05] alive and they admits that he's present
[1:01:08] amen so you know he said many great men
[1:01:10] like paul reveres of today you know they
[1:01:12] would run you know paul revere he was
[1:01:14] he was the man who who when the british
[1:01:16] were invading america and you know he
[1:01:17] you know he got on a horse and he rode
[1:01:19] and he
[1:01:19] told the people the british are coming
[1:01:21] the british are coming and you know they
[1:01:23] you know but many people are writing
[1:01:24] today but without a message you know
[1:01:26] what good would it be for paul revere to
[1:01:27] get on his horse and ride without a
[1:01:29] message
[1:01:29] he'd just be going for a ride but yes
[1:01:31] the same thing you know christianity we
[1:01:33] don't just live a life without something
[1:01:35] to tell
[1:01:36] i mean but we have a message that our
[1:01:38] king is alive i mean he's present upon
[1:01:40] the earth he hasn't diminished in power
[1:01:42] one iota
[1:01:43] he's just as powerful today he is a god
[1:01:45] of miracles today
[1:01:46] he's the god of the impossible today
[1:01:48] amen he is alive today
[1:01:50] and i'm so thankful that when he said go
[1:01:52] and tell he equipped them to go and tell
[1:01:55] i mean it wasn't just something they
[1:01:56] learned it's not something in their
[1:01:57] minds that they went and just rehearsed
[1:01:59] but it was a living god i mean they
[1:02:02] carried that presence of the living god
[1:02:03] to the people
[1:02:04] amen and then god lived hallelujah he he
[1:02:07] inspired their words he calls
[1:02:08] them he he vindicated what they said
[1:02:11] amen it should be the same thing with
[1:02:13] you and i today that god would vindicate
[1:02:15] the words we say that our witness is a
[1:02:17] true witness
[1:02:18] not because you're trying to be a
[1:02:20] witness for christ but he comes and
[1:02:21] anna's
[1:02:22] is the witness in your life hallelujah
[1:02:26] amen i was going to call this how to
[1:02:30] function in times of uncertainty
[1:02:32] because it's an uncertain time as i said
[1:02:34] a few weeks ago i was reading a bbc
[1:02:37] article and this was the title of it how
[1:02:38] to function in times of uncertainty
[1:02:40] although that's a good that's a good
[1:02:42] phrase you know because we need to know
[1:02:44] how to function in this day and age you
[1:02:46] know
[1:02:46] many people they say their life is on
[1:02:48] hold because of covert 19.
[1:02:51] you know and sure many plans have been
[1:02:52] put on hold but you know
[1:02:54] as as you know the saying goes never
[1:02:56] waste a good crisis
[1:02:58] right you know the devil doesn't waste a
[1:03:00] good crisis
[1:03:01] we shouldn't waste a good crisis you
[1:03:03] know we should be using this
[1:03:05] crisis for our benefit hallelujah i mean
[1:03:08] so we should never think well our lives
[1:03:10] have been put on hold no actually our
[1:03:12] plans may be put on hold
[1:03:14] but our lives haven't been put on hold
[1:03:16] that's why we need to seek the will of
[1:03:17] the lord said lord what is your will
[1:03:19] in my life for this season amen amen
[1:03:24] uh paul would write to timothy and say
[1:03:26] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[1:03:28] on eternal life
[1:03:29] wherein unto thou has thou art also
[1:03:32] called and has professed a good
[1:03:33] profession before many witnesses
[1:03:35] i give thee charge in the sight of god
[1:03:37] who quickeneth all things and before
[1:03:39] christ jesus who before pontius pilate
[1:03:42] witness
[1:03:43] a good confession which in his times he
[1:03:46] shall show
[1:03:46] who is the blessed and only pontitate
[1:03:49] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:03:51] who only hath immortality dwelling in
[1:03:53] light which no man can approach unto
[1:03:56] whom no man has seen nor can see to whom
[1:03:58] be honor and power everlasting amen
[1:04:01] charge them that are rich in this world
[1:04:02] that they be not high-minded nor trust
[1:04:04] in
[1:04:05] uncertain riches anyone seen you know in
[1:04:08] the news today uh well
[1:04:09] you know this past week there's just you
[1:04:11] know you know the the stock exchange is
[1:04:13] such a crooked thing now if you invest
[1:04:15] in stocks that
[1:04:16] that's up to you but you know there's
[1:04:18] this there's this
[1:04:19] war going on in the stock exchange in
[1:04:21] america where where basically it's
[1:04:23] it's it's it's these people have taken
[1:04:25] these stocks of this company which was
[1:04:26] going down
[1:04:27] and they've just been buying it has been
[1:04:29] going oh look up 700 percent it's value
[1:04:32] and you know people are alarmed all this
[1:04:34] but what's happening is it's a war
[1:04:35] against the people on wall street
[1:04:36] because there's people on wall street
[1:04:38] that basically hedge bets that that
[1:04:40] stocks are going to go down and they
[1:04:41] manipulate things in certain ways
[1:04:42] and people are fighting this kind of
[1:04:44] stock war going on so you can't have you
[1:04:46] know but the value of this company it's
[1:04:48] a failing company
[1:04:50] but yet people have just been putting
[1:04:51] money into it money into it so on paper
[1:04:53] looks very
[1:04:54] successful but in reality it's not
[1:04:56] successful
[1:04:57] and to me all that is is uncertain
[1:04:58] riches you know people are just fighting
[1:05:01] a war over something to time get one
[1:05:03] up against each other we shouldn't put
[1:05:05] our trust now as i said nothing is a
[1:05:07] stock exchange if you invest in stocks
[1:05:08] go for it
[1:05:09] you know i pray the lord bless you
[1:05:10] whatever you do but you know all i'm
[1:05:12] saying is
[1:05:13] riches are uncertain really there are
[1:05:16] digits on the screen or digits on paper
[1:05:18] they can change
[1:05:19] you know once upon a time this is um
[1:05:21] this is after world war ii you know the
[1:05:23] german currency was worth quite a lot
[1:05:25] but there came a time where it just
[1:05:26] collapsed and a whole wheelbarrow of
[1:05:27] money was for a
[1:05:29] piece of bread it just it just went to
[1:05:31] nothing
[1:05:33] so this world is uncertain but we know
[1:05:35] how to function in this uncertain world
[1:05:37] because we have the certain one
[1:05:38] hallelujah that's why i'm so glad we can
[1:05:40] just depend upon him
[1:05:42] aren't you glad you can harlow it
[1:05:44] doesn't matter what the world's doing
[1:05:45] what the world thinks it's going to do i
[1:05:47] mean we have a certain sound in this day
[1:05:49] to me this message was not uncertain
[1:05:52] people say it's a bunch of confusion to
[1:05:53] me it's not a bunch of confusion
[1:05:55] the bible even says peter says about the
[1:05:57] writings of paul he says even the
[1:05:58] writings of brother paul who are hard to
[1:06:00] understand
[1:06:01] where many wrestle with and the rest of
[1:06:03] the scriptures to their own destruction
[1:06:05] but to me if you've been given the
[1:06:07] spirit of truth it's clear
[1:06:09] it's not a myriad of confusion it's
[1:06:11] actually a
[1:06:12] reality and it's actually peace and life
[1:06:15] and it will guide your life hallelujah
[1:06:18] amen so i'm glad
[1:06:21] i'm glad we do not have an uncertain
[1:06:24] sound
[1:06:25] but we have a very certain sound in this
[1:06:27] day this message sure is certain
[1:06:30] amen we have the driverless car amen
[1:06:33] it's here you can go on it
[1:06:36] amen we have a you know people say well
[1:06:40] it's prophecy fulfilled well it's not
[1:06:41] well
[1:06:42] to me it's very interesting we have a
[1:06:43] female vice president in america
[1:06:46] we have a second catholic president in
[1:06:48] history
[1:06:49] you know and most of the supreme court
[1:06:52] is catholic anyway over there
[1:06:53] yeah that's right so what is it now it's
[1:06:55] basically a catholic it's been run by
[1:06:57] the catholic church for a long time
[1:06:58] anyway
[1:06:59] we shouldn't be alarmed by what we just
[1:07:00] saw a couple of weeks ago because it's
[1:07:02] been there anyway for a long time
[1:07:04] prophecy fulfilled we see the modern
[1:07:06] church running
[1:07:07] following the spirit of rock and roll
[1:07:10] right we see all these things the
[1:07:12] prophet told us we shouldn't be
[1:07:14] alarmed but then we're also the main
[1:07:16] thing to me the main
[1:07:17] sign of the time is the bride getting
[1:07:19] ready amy because when that little woman
[1:07:21] gets in step with the word then there'll
[1:07:23] be a message come and sweep her and
[1:07:24] catch her away
[1:07:25] and now that's what's been happening
[1:07:26] from since the prophet left to today is
[1:07:28] there's a people
[1:07:29] aligning with the word it's not their
[1:07:32] opinion they're aligning with or dogma
[1:07:33] of man but it's the word and then
[1:07:35] becoming one
[1:07:36] and that's what i see in front of me as
[1:07:38] a people maturing into the full
[1:07:40] manifestation of the word
[1:07:41] this is where we are i mean you are
[1:07:43] actually the god's
[1:07:44] timepiece because remember
[1:07:48] god's going to turn back to israel we
[1:07:49] know that and to me i was just singing
[1:07:51] as well brother
[1:07:52] well jesus said the generation that sees
[1:07:54] israel become a nation shall not pass
[1:07:56] till all things be fulfilled
[1:07:58] they were they became a nation in 1948
[1:08:00] yeah
[1:08:01] that's a long time ago the generation
[1:08:04] that saw that
[1:08:05] will not pass to all things be fulfilled
[1:08:07] so where are we friends
[1:08:09] hallelujah that's exciting to me you
[1:08:11] know
[1:08:12] someone said to brother brown brother
[1:08:13] ram you scare people into this saying
[1:08:15] this
[1:08:15] you're this god's coming yo jesus is
[1:08:17] coming he said i shouldn't scare you to
[1:08:19] death it should thrill your soul
[1:08:21] then the one that doubts me is going to
[1:08:23] come carry me away up into heaven
[1:08:25] hallelujah shouldn't that excite us i
[1:08:27] think it should excite us well
[1:08:29] i'm not ready he'll make you ready
[1:08:31] that's why he died on calvary's why he
[1:08:33] shed forth his holy spirit to make us
[1:08:34] ready
[1:08:35] it's not us making us ready says and the
[1:08:37] bride well the scripture says well the
[1:08:39] bride has made herself ready but it was
[1:08:40] unto her was granted
[1:08:42] that should be a raid in fine linen so
[1:08:43] you just got to put on the garment
[1:08:45] hallelujah isn't that right you know you
[1:08:48] think i you know you go to a certain
[1:08:49] occasion you think well
[1:08:51] do i have the right kind of clothing
[1:08:52] where you go into your wardrobe you do
[1:08:54] it's been granted yeah
[1:08:55] amen hallelujah so his righteousness has
[1:08:58] been grounded just
[1:08:59] put it on put on the word say yes lord
[1:09:02] amen now he says if this heritage of god
[1:09:06] if this people that god died for if this
[1:09:08] church has been called by his name
[1:09:10] as ever to be saved we've got to have a
[1:09:12] messenger with a message from the throne
[1:09:14] to meet the challenge of this day now we
[1:09:17] know the true messenger of this day is
[1:09:18] the holy ghost
[1:09:20] he used a man from kentucky he used
[1:09:21] malachi for the prophet but it was the
[1:09:23] holy ghost speaking through him
[1:09:25] hallelujah brother maybe the prophet of
[1:09:28] the day is the holy ghost
[1:09:30] he's still here hallelujah amen
[1:09:33] hallelujah no i'm not doing away with
[1:09:35] the prophet's ministry as a man but hey
[1:09:37] that was god speaking to him he said he
[1:09:38] said i wanted to be a trapper i didn't
[1:09:39] want to do this
[1:09:41] amen amen amen to meet the challenge of
[1:09:44] this day there is a goliath but god will
[1:09:46] surely have a david
[1:09:48] somewhere i'm so glad the devil has a
[1:09:50] challenge but there's always something
[1:09:51] to meet the challenge
[1:09:52] and that one to meet the challenge is
[1:09:53] already prepared before the devil ever
[1:09:55] comes on the scene
[1:09:56] amen david was already anointed to be
[1:09:58] king he
[1:09:59] had already killed the lion already
[1:10:00] killed the bear already had a living
[1:10:02] testimony that
[1:10:03] that his weapon was enough i mean that
[1:10:05] when he saw goliath he says well my
[1:10:06] weapon's enough i killed this one i
[1:10:08] killed that one i've killed this one as
[1:10:10] well
[1:10:10] they're exactly the same as these
[1:10:11] animals and what happened his weapon was
[1:10:13] enough
[1:10:14] and he even prophesied well i'll take
[1:10:16] your sword i'll chop your head off
[1:10:17] amen and he wasn't willing just to you
[1:10:19] know goliath had brothers
[1:10:22] he picked up more than just one stone
[1:10:24] that's right he said well if i got to
[1:10:25] kill them all well
[1:10:27] hallelujah with enough sunlight to do it
[1:10:28] and if i run out of time i'll just say
[1:10:30] the sun stands still moon stands still
[1:10:32] we have more time
[1:10:34] what are you trying to say nothing can
[1:10:35] stand before the bride of christ
[1:10:37] nothing can stand before you hallelujah
[1:10:39] we've gotta we're gonna have such a
[1:10:40] confidence we've got to remember who we

[1:10:56] defeated we are not built to be
[1:10:58] defeated by the devil but we are built
[1:11:00] to defeat the devil

[1:11:03] fastest man in the world on this day

[1:11:09] to run the hundred meters in the time
[1:11:11] he's he's built sure he's got to do
[1:11:12] training but he's got the right
[1:11:14] muscle composition he's got the right
[1:11:16] frame and the right step
[1:11:17] he's built to run it i could do the same
[1:11:20] training
[1:11:22] i could eat the same food i could wear
[1:11:24] the same clothes i could have the same
[1:11:26] shoes
[1:11:26] i could do everything he does i would
[1:11:29] never run it in his place
[1:11:30] because i'm not built to run like him no
[1:11:33] matter
[1:11:34] doesn't matter if my ambition's the same
[1:11:36] if my focus is the same i will never run
[1:11:39] it the same as him
[1:11:40] because i'm not built the same way amen

[1:11:55] spiritual new birth
[1:11:57] i mean to overcome this age we ought to
[1:12:00] remember who we are
[1:12:02] look at the mirror in the morning

[1:12:05] we're sons and daughters of the most
[1:12:07] high god amen we are not here just to go

[1:12:33] marvels me how he can take someone and
[1:12:35] just change their whole life
[1:12:39] how did he do that i don't know but he
[1:12:40] did it and he still does it today
[1:12:43] amen amen we are going but with nothing
[1:12:46] to say it proves it when we come to a
[1:12:48] place that a nation or a people that
[1:12:50] deny jesus christ to be the son of god
[1:12:52] and stands in the face of our most
[1:12:54] challenging ministers
[1:12:56] of today and then in our great church
[1:12:58] league finding some 30 communist packing
[1:13:00] papers for 20 or 30 years
[1:13:02] that they're members of the communistic
[1:13:03] party in our
[1:13:05] united churches what can we do it shows
[1:13:07] that we have run without a message
[1:13:09] selling out the very birthrights of the
[1:13:11] nation selling out the regular
[1:13:12] birthrights of the church you know i
[1:13:14] don't have it on me but it just comes to
[1:13:16] mind
[1:13:16] they had a they had a meeting in
[1:13:18] congress this is before the inauguration
[1:13:21] and they um in the senate rather and
[1:13:23] they and and and a man who was a former
[1:13:25] i think methodist minister stood up and
[1:13:26] said a prayer
[1:13:28] he didn't use the name of jesus christ
[1:13:30] he he he he
[1:13:32] he said some name of some hindu deity
[1:13:34] and he finished with amen and a woman
[1:13:38] you think about the founding fathers of
[1:13:40] that country if they were sitting in
[1:13:42] that audience and they heard that
[1:13:44] they would have there would have been a
[1:13:46] riot get this man out of this place how
[1:13:49] dare he do
[1:13:50] this nation was founded under god and
[1:13:51] look where it's gone
[1:13:53] brother braham said it's falling apart
[1:13:55] this nation's fallen apart too
[1:13:58] it's not easy to see a train wreck but
[1:14:00] it's train wrecking that's right
[1:14:02] but thank god that this is not our final
[1:14:04] resting place amen
[1:14:06] it just shows you that we're really at
[1:14:07] the end of all things
[1:14:09] amen it has to come
[1:14:13] it has to come to a showdown it's come
[1:14:15] to a place at the little church that's
[1:14:17] believed the message
[1:14:18] and stood on both feet with their eyes
[1:14:20] centered on the cross in their heart the
[1:14:22] resurrection of jesus christ burning
[1:14:24] it's come to a place where the nations
[1:14:25] has got to recognize it it's got to
[1:14:27] it's to a showdown no matter what the
[1:14:29] church is when the council of churches
[1:14:30] are so honeycomb with communistic
[1:14:32] no wonder they can't believe in the
[1:14:34] supernatural no wonder they don't
[1:14:35] believe in divine healing
[1:14:36] they don't have any message in their
[1:14:38] heart no matter how hard they're running
[1:14:40] if the holy ghost comes into a man's
[1:14:41] heart he'll believe that jesus christ is
[1:14:43] raised from the dead
[1:14:44] and he's alive in him to do and to do
[1:14:47] the world that he came to do
[1:14:48] the will the will of god through the
[1:14:50] man's life
[1:14:51] amen hallelujah you know it's amazing
[1:14:56] i marvel at this this is this is just
[1:14:58] after we read our opening scripture
[1:15:01] here's mary magdalene magdalene she sees
[1:15:04] that he's alive
[1:15:07] she runs back to the disciples gives
[1:15:10] them the report
[1:15:11] i doubt very much that the way she
[1:15:13] looked and the way she felt and the way
[1:15:14] she was talking when she left was the
[1:15:16] same way she came back with
[1:15:18] you know maybe she just said maybe she
[1:15:19] didn't speak to them but some others
[1:15:21] i'm just going to go to the tomb i don't
[1:15:23] know what to do with myself
[1:15:25] i can't sit here can't do the i'm i'm
[1:15:27] just going to go to the tomb
[1:15:28] broken-hearted she's a broken-hearted
[1:15:30] woman i doubt very much she came back in
[1:15:32] that kind of frame of mind
[1:15:33] she would have burst through the door
[1:15:35] he's alive i mean he appeared to me the
[1:15:37] stones rolled away and he's present he's
[1:15:39] alive as he promised hallelujah
[1:15:41] he's a resurrected savior he's alive
[1:15:43] today hallelujah
[1:15:46] but it says they believed amen not
[1:15:51] obviously something happened to her
[1:15:53] she goes away sad she comes back glad
[1:15:56] her message was different
[1:15:59] but they said well
[1:16:02] amen here she comes and running mary's
[1:16:05] claiming that she saw him no doubt she
[1:16:07] was extremely excited she had seen and
[1:16:09] spoken with the risen lord wouldn't that
[1:16:10] make you excited
[1:16:12] you can speak with him today amen that
[1:16:14] same one is alive right now
[1:16:16] amen he wasn't the dead body that she
[1:16:18] saw him uh saw being placed in the tomb
[1:16:20] a few days ago
[1:16:22] i mean and if i could put it this way
[1:16:24] the word wasn't just ink on paper
[1:16:26] anymore it was living
[1:16:28] it wasn't something to debate and
[1:16:29] something to question it was alive
[1:16:32] amen and then and then after this it
[1:16:34] says
[1:16:35] that the two on the way to emmaus now i
[1:16:37] don't know the time frame of this but
[1:16:38] mary came in rejoicing a few hours later
[1:16:40] these two came in rejoicing
[1:16:42] as i said i doubt very much the way they
[1:16:44] came back is the way they left
[1:16:47] they maybe said brothers we're just
[1:16:49] going to go back to emmaus
[1:16:51] god bless you you know broken-hearted
[1:16:54] they're welded fallen apart
[1:16:56] but they would they would walk with the
[1:16:58] one that they thought was dead and he'd
[1:16:59] be carried away somewhere all mysterious
[1:17:01] and he would open the scripture to them
[1:17:02] for six hours
[1:17:04] and then finally they'd come into the
[1:17:05] house where they were going to be and
[1:17:06] then he would take the bread and he'd
[1:17:08] break the bread he did something that he
[1:17:09] did
[1:17:10] before he died and their eyes came open
[1:17:12] it's you hallelujah they disappeared
[1:17:14] and they didn't walk they didn't take
[1:17:16] six hours walking back i mean but they
[1:17:18] ran back to jerusalem
[1:17:20] to go tell the disciples that he's alive
[1:17:23] hallelujah hallelujah it's amazing
[1:17:26] they had plans mary had plans i'll just
[1:17:30] go to the tomb the stone will be there
[1:17:32] i don't know what i'm gonna do just roll
[1:17:34] it away anoint the body of spices she
[1:17:35] had plans
[1:17:36] but the lord interrupted her plans these
[1:17:39] two on the way to emmaus
[1:17:40] they have plans we're just gonna go back
[1:17:43] to emmaus
[1:17:44] but god's in the business of
[1:17:45] interrupting plans
[1:17:47] hallelujah you know you just think of a
[1:17:49] certain day
[1:17:50] when the lord came and interrupted your
[1:17:52] plans when he went from beyond
[1:17:54] from from just a story to a living
[1:17:56] reality
[1:17:59] hallelujah you know we've all had plans
[1:18:01] sometimes they're very vague plans
[1:18:04] some people have very detailed plans but
[1:18:07] i'm looking into people the lord has
[1:18:09] interrupted their plans hallelujah
[1:18:12] amen hallelujah you know
[1:18:16] people ask the question what do you want
[1:18:17] to be when you grow up
[1:18:19] some people say i want to be this and
[1:18:20] they become that i don't know what i
[1:18:23] wanted to be but i'm not what
[1:18:26] hallelujah that's all right amen
[1:18:29] my plans are very vague you know my best
[1:18:31] friend at the time he said to me because
[1:18:33] i don't know where i was gonna study or
[1:18:34] whatever after school
[1:18:35] and he just said to me come down to
[1:18:37] christchurch because we're studying
[1:18:38] engineering you just might as well come
[1:18:39] do so i did
[1:18:41] that's pretty vague but hey the lord had
[1:18:43] a purpose in that i met god down in
[1:18:45] christchurch
[1:18:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:50] sometimes we think we're just wandering
[1:18:51] through life but god's got you right on
[1:18:53] right on schedule hallelujah you know if
[1:18:55] you say well i want to be you know
[1:18:58] the lord interrupts our plans because he
[1:19:00] wants us to be more than just a mom
[1:19:02] more than just a dad have a career go to
[1:19:05] uni learn a trade
[1:19:06] but he's commissioning us i want you to
[1:19:08] be my living witness
[1:19:10] i want to go in you and live through to
[1:19:12] be a living witness to this age
[1:19:14] hallelujah you know he'll speak right
[1:19:16] through you if you let him
[1:19:18] that's right hallelujah he'll take your
[1:19:21] vocal cords take your tongue bypass this
[1:19:23] and speak something to someone
[1:19:26] oh that's just for the ministry no no
[1:19:27] that's for anyone no i'm not no i'm not
[1:19:29] saying oh you you know
[1:19:30] and this and this is not having
[1:19:32] something pre-planned in your mind that
[1:19:33] you're imagining then you speak it out
[1:19:34] no
[1:19:35] god can use your lips amen to speak to
[1:19:38] someone's life
[1:19:39] can turn someone's life completely
[1:19:41] around
[1:19:42] hallelujah amen amen
[1:19:46] he does do that why because the voice of
[1:19:48] god is in the bride
[1:19:50] because he is in her amen right
[1:19:53] now i love the story of of of naaman
[1:19:56] oh yeah he was a little girl
[1:20:00] she was a slave girl you know in the
[1:20:02] scripture we all have a role
[1:20:04] some have very big roles you could say
[1:20:07] uh brother brown had a very big role in
[1:20:09] the scripture
[1:20:10] moses had a very big role paul had a
[1:20:12] very big role
[1:20:14] you know but it doesn't matter how big
[1:20:16] the role may seem
[1:20:17] it's all significant to god john the
[1:20:19] baptist had a very small role but a very
[1:20:21] significant role
[1:20:22] he would be prepared for 30 years for
[1:20:24] six months ministry
[1:20:25] but that ministry was to introduce the
[1:20:27] messiah to the people very small role
[1:20:29] but a very big role
[1:20:31] and sometimes it can just be like
[1:20:33] shamgar had one scripture in the bible
[1:20:35] but that's all he needed
[1:20:36] hallelujah david had a lot of scripture
[1:20:38] in the bible but all their roles were
[1:20:40] important
[1:20:41] now this little slave girl there wasn't
[1:20:43] much said about her her name's not
[1:20:44] recorded
[1:20:45] you know it doesn't even say where she
[1:20:47] is from in israel but her role was vital
[1:20:50] she would she would have such a you know
[1:20:52] she would she would have a
[1:20:54] have a testimony that when neyman was
[1:20:57] found to be a leper she would just say
[1:20:59] oh
[1:21:00] would would god my lord were with the
[1:21:02] prophetess and samaria for he would
[1:21:04] recover of his leprosy
[1:21:05] that's all that's recorded that she said
[1:21:07] but she was inspired
[1:21:09] to say that amen it doesn't matter how
[1:21:12] big a little we think we are
[1:21:13] we have a role you take an orchestra
[1:21:15] there's the lead instruments but you
[1:21:17] know sometimes a
[1:21:18] man can stand in the back and he can
[1:21:19] have a triangle and he can be standing
[1:21:21] there for most of the
[1:21:22] opening and whatever however the music
[1:21:24] goes and he just does a ting
[1:21:26] but that thing is needed because that
[1:21:28] thing is on the sheet music
[1:21:30] and and and maybe we may miss it if it's
[1:21:32] not there but the one who wrote the
[1:21:34] composer of the piece
[1:21:35] if he doesn't hear the ting in his mind
[1:21:37] he says something is wrong
[1:21:39] amen and our lord jesus is is the great
[1:21:42] composer of the sheep music
[1:21:44] amen and he wants every piece to play in
[1:21:47] their time
[1:21:48] hallelujah so i could say the man with
[1:21:50] the triangle that just goes ting is just
[1:21:51] as important as the lead violinist
[1:21:54] because it all makes the music amen so
[1:21:57] every one of us are important to god we
[1:21:59] all have a job to do
[1:22:01] we have the best job he's little
[1:22:04] he's alive he's living amen
[1:22:08] now notice brother ram says oh no i
[1:22:10] don't have this in my notes it's hard
[1:22:12] when you change things and you can't get
[1:22:13] there to change things and
[1:22:14] he says now this this brother brownie
[1:22:16] says it's in the supernatural
[1:22:17] now notice that child under inspiration
[1:22:20] was led to say those words
[1:22:22] we don't know of elijah ever healing
[1:22:24] anyone else or maybe no one else no
[1:22:25] matter how many he prayed for
[1:22:27] but she said i would to god that my lord
[1:22:29] was over with my country
[1:22:31] for in my country we have a prophet oh
[1:22:34] if we could say
[1:22:35] that about our churches today i would to
[1:22:38] god
[1:22:39] that we would come under the influence
[1:22:40] that i live under and my church lives
[1:22:42] under
[1:22:43] for we believe that god is a healer we
[1:22:46] believe that god is a savior
[1:22:48] we believe that god gives the holy
[1:22:50] spirit i would to god you lived in my
[1:22:52] country
[1:22:53] that's the kind of atmosphere we should
[1:22:54] be living in we have the answer to every
[1:22:57] problem
[1:22:58] i would to god you knew my god amen he
[1:23:01] would sort out your family he'd sort out
[1:23:03] your marriage troubles he'd heal your
[1:23:04] sick he would give you clarity of life
[1:23:06] and give you purpose
[1:23:07] amen he'll wash all your sins away i
[1:23:09] would to god you knew my god
[1:23:11] amen hallelujah there's many people
[1:23:15] today that doesn't know that jesus
[1:23:17] christ is still alive
[1:23:18] they don't know that he still rules and
[1:23:20] reigns they don't know that the blood at
[1:23:22] calvary for the all-sufficient
[1:23:24] that even purchased there at the cross
[1:23:26] for your transgressions and for your
[1:23:28] healings
[1:23:28] they don't know that that that's real
[1:23:30] today he says we need some more little
[1:23:33] mates to go around and testify of these
[1:23:36] things
[1:23:37] don't you think so get in the atmosphere
[1:23:40] of it
[1:23:40] that's what we need is few more mates to
[1:23:42] go around hello little mates how you
[1:23:44] doing
[1:23:45] i mean to go around the country get in
[1:23:47] the atmosphere of the
[1:23:48] of the holy ghost and go and speak to a
[1:23:50] lost and dying world and say i went to
[1:23:52] god you knew my god
[1:23:54] you know some people think well are you
[1:23:56] against things no i'm just for jesus
[1:23:58] amen hallelujah
[1:24:02] he says it's not afraid what the world
[1:24:05] says because
[1:24:06] while we're talking with the world we're
[1:24:08] still in another atmosphere you're
[1:24:10] talking to the sinner but you're not in
[1:24:11] his atmosphere
[1:24:13] and you're in such a glorious and
[1:24:14] shrouded in the shekinah glory all
[1:24:16] around you
[1:24:17] and the veil of the world hit you can
[1:24:19] talk to the worldly woman or the worldly
[1:24:21] men
[1:24:21] or whoever it is and still live in that
[1:24:23] shekinah glory telling them of a loving
[1:24:26] god that's raised from the dead
[1:24:31] you know my my supervisor at work um
[1:24:35] he's a gay guy and when we first met he
[1:24:38] told me this
[1:24:39] because he saw my resume because i put
[1:24:41] on my resume that
[1:24:42] other activities i do as i pastor a
[1:24:43] church he thought that i'd be against
[1:24:45] them
[1:24:46] i said no not at all god respects our
[1:24:48] choices i respect you for who you are
[1:24:50] i trust you respect me for who i am and
[1:24:52] we got talking about the lord in the lab
[1:24:53] one day and he says well is your as your
[1:24:55] church
[1:24:56] uh lgbq whatever friendly i said we
[1:24:59] welcome everyone
[1:25:01] but the lord changes everyone that comes
[1:25:03] and i share testimonies about you
[1:25:06] i said this is not a bunch of rules it's
[1:25:08] a love relationship
[1:25:09] with our lord jesus christ it's not
[1:25:11] rules not keeping some list of things
[1:25:13] no he's actually a living god because we
[1:25:16] do welcome everyone
[1:25:17] but you won't stay the way you came in
[1:25:19] jesus name amen because the god of the
[1:25:21] book of acts is still the same
[1:25:23] i believe hallelujah i see but god is a
[1:25:26] gentleman we respect other people's
[1:25:28] choices oh yes
[1:25:29] because god respects their choice amen
[1:25:33] but i'm so thankful you know as i said
[1:25:35] you know i told him jesus will change
[1:25:37] your life he had a bible he went to a
[1:25:38] catholic boarding school he's a hindu
[1:25:40] background
[1:25:41] being indian but you know i said jesus
[1:25:43] will change all he changed my life
[1:25:44] he can change your life he can
[1:25:48] can he not amen
[1:25:51] hey is there anything too hard for the
[1:25:53] lord i thought i was a hard case
[1:25:57] he sort of be out you'd probably put
[1:25:59] yourself in the same category
[1:26:01] because god doesn't have a too hard
[1:26:02] basket we do hallelujah i'm glad he
[1:26:05] doesn't
[1:26:06] now let's just skip to the you know so
[1:26:08] here she is she gives us testimony we
[1:26:10] know the rest of the story
[1:26:11] where where naaman goes to to israel and
[1:26:14] so but let's jump to the
[1:26:16] end of the story naaman returns
[1:26:20] he's no longer a leper you just think
[1:26:22] about this for a second
[1:26:24] there had not been a single leper ever
[1:26:25] healed in history
[1:26:27] that's recorded not a single one
[1:26:30] but he comes back and he's not a leper
[1:26:34] this should have turned syria upside
[1:26:36] down yeah
[1:26:37] you think about it this had never been
[1:26:38] done before it
[1:26:40] hit no one had ever been healed of
[1:26:41] leprosy before it was a literally a
[1:26:44] death sentence to become a leper in
[1:26:45] those days
[1:26:46] you had to go to a leper colony you're
[1:26:48] ostracized from society
[1:26:50] he could never be a general again he
[1:26:52] could never live in his house again he
[1:26:53] could never be with his wife again
[1:26:55] he had to separate himself from everyone
[1:26:56] and go live in a leper colony that was
[1:26:58] the normal order of life
[1:27:00] but then he comes back and he's not a
[1:27:02] leper
[1:27:04] as i said this should have turned syria
[1:27:05] upside down but to me it's just like the
[1:27:07] disciples
[1:27:09] they heard from three witnesses that
[1:27:11] jesus was alive but they didn't believe
[1:27:13] and it goes to show that you know they
[1:27:15] had to have the experience that he's
[1:27:17] alive for themselves
[1:27:20] amen because remember naaman he wasn't
[1:27:22] just anyone he was the general yeah
[1:27:25] he was the upper nups everyone knew who
[1:27:28] neyman was in syria he was a mighty
[1:27:29] warrior
[1:27:30] in their in their armies he was the
[1:27:32] leader of their campaigns he was a
[1:27:33] celebrity of the celebrity
[1:27:37] but it would have been so it would have
[1:27:38] been very interesting conversation in
[1:27:39] neyman's house let's just go to naaman's
[1:27:41] house you know
[1:27:42] while while naaman is away and and we've
[1:27:44] come to speak to lady neyman
[1:27:47] no doubt she's upset maybe she's excited
[1:27:49] because you know there's a god in israel
[1:27:50] that can heal
[1:27:52] but you know a lot of people we you know
[1:27:54] when bad stuff happens
[1:27:56] a lot of different people come around
[1:27:59] comfort but it's actually not comforting
[1:28:01] it's just rubbing into the fact that
[1:28:02] you're down
[1:28:03] some comfort because they want to
[1:28:04] comfort yeah and some comfort because
[1:28:07] they just
[1:28:07] they're nosy they're wondering what's
[1:28:08] going on but you know wouldn't it be
[1:28:11] interesting to speak to lady neyman and
[1:28:13] you know
[1:28:13] people no doubt would have you know her
[1:28:15] friends and so on would have tried to
[1:28:16] come and comfort her
[1:28:18] you know we're so sorry that neyman's a
[1:28:19] leper and he can't be here anymore but
[1:28:21] you know maybe she would reply but it's
[1:28:23] okay he's going to come back soon
[1:28:26] now no doubt in the people's minds they
[1:28:29] would have been thinking he ain't coming
[1:28:30] back
[1:28:32] where is it in our history the lep has
[1:28:34] ever returned not a leper
[1:28:38] you know and maybe maybe they said yeah
[1:28:40] sure he is
[1:28:42] but knowing full well he can't come back
[1:28:44] in that condition
[1:28:46] that's how people might have thought
[1:28:47] about you
[1:28:49] i guess they will never get out of this
[1:28:51] thing they'll never get through this
[1:28:52] problem they'll never overcome this
[1:28:54] situation they're just got to be stuck
[1:28:55] in that way
[1:28:56] this is just how they are for the rest
[1:28:57] of their life while their mother and
[1:28:59] father were like that so they'll be like
[1:29:01] that
[1:29:02] you know you just get people just think
[1:29:04] well you just gotta go down this track
[1:29:06] of life this kind of way and
[1:29:07] because of how your first birth is
[1:29:11] you may have even thought that about
[1:29:12] yourself there's no way i can overcome
[1:29:14] this and this is how my family is and i
[1:29:16] see the same traits in me and
[1:29:17] this is just how it has to be and
[1:29:20] everyone's going real quiet
[1:29:23] but isn't that right something you think
[1:29:24] man i'm just this is just how i am and
[1:29:26] this is just
[1:29:27] right but god never just looks at us and
[1:29:30] say this is just how you're going to be
[1:29:31] because he has a different image of you
[1:29:33] in his mind that image that he has of
[1:29:35] you in his mind is
[1:29:36] is his image hallelujah i'm glad the
[1:29:40] lord can change any personality he wants
[1:29:42] to
[1:29:44] amen hallelujah but then naaman comes
[1:29:47] back
[1:29:49] and he's no more a leper imagine that
[1:29:53] he rides in his chariot gets off maybe
[1:29:55] people are kind of trying to social
[1:29:57] distance themselves because he's you
[1:29:58] know got this but
[1:29:59] he comes in and and all the white's gone
[1:30:02] he's rejoicing how could you not be
[1:30:05] rejoicing
[1:30:06] i had an incurable disease but it got
[1:30:08] cured
[1:30:10] hallelujah and then maybe the questions
[1:30:13] would have started well why didn't he
[1:30:15] just go to the house of ramon
[1:30:17] but they knew that god couldn't do
[1:30:18] anything no matter how much they
[1:30:20] worshipped how much they preached how
[1:30:21] much they prayed
[1:30:22] he couldn't do anything and then he
[1:30:25] asked for
[1:30:27] two mule's burden of earth i believe i
[1:30:29] have it there
[1:30:31] you know because he wanted to take a bit
[1:30:32] of ground where where jehovah god
[1:30:34] dwelled and he wanted to put it there
[1:30:36] and
[1:30:38] and then you know and then he begins his
[1:30:41] life begins to be different he begins to
[1:30:43] worship differently to how he did before
[1:30:45] hallelujah he's now a living testimony
[1:30:48] why do you worship the god of israel
[1:30:50] well i'll tell you a story
[1:30:52] i'll tell you a story i was leprous one
[1:30:54] day
[1:30:55] i couldn't no nothing could help me but
[1:30:57] then you see that slave girl there
[1:30:59] she lived in such an atmosphere even in
[1:31:01] great trouble even being a slave girl
[1:31:03] not even in her own country but she
[1:31:05] lived in such an atmosphere
[1:31:06] where she believed her god was god and
[1:31:09] she would pray to that god and she would
[1:31:10] just her life was a testimony
[1:31:12] and when she heard that i was leprous
[1:31:14] she wasn't saying well it serves them
[1:31:16] right
[1:31:16] no she just said i would to god that
[1:31:18] he'd be in israel with my prophet
[1:31:20] because we're he we're that prophet as
[1:31:21] god is hallelujah and so i went there
[1:31:24] and you know i had to go dip in the
[1:31:25] jordan lots of know my pride had to be
[1:31:27] taken out of me and
[1:31:28] you know but after i got out of the
[1:31:30] water the seventh time that leprosy was
[1:31:32] gone
[1:31:33] hallelujah then no doubt you'd say okay
[1:31:36] i understand why you worship the way you
[1:31:37] did
[1:31:39] but wouldn't it be interesting this is
[1:31:40] just my little mind so so he says to
[1:31:43] you know that you know he's speaking to
[1:31:45] the prophets here uh uh uh to the
[1:31:47] prophet here before he leaves
[1:31:48] israel he says pardon my servant you
[1:31:50] know i'm gonna go into the house of
[1:31:51] rahman
[1:31:52] to worship there because my master you
[1:31:53] know he wants to lean on my hand all
[1:31:55] these things
[1:31:56] and then i i don't have it up here but
[1:31:57] the next verse basically the prophet is
[1:31:59] gone peace
[1:32:00] but imagine imagine going into this
[1:32:02] church now
[1:32:03] and the one that you are going to lean
[1:32:05] on his hand or however that worked
[1:32:07] with you because you're the king he's
[1:32:09] right there
[1:32:10] the man you're worth has been healed not
[1:32:13] by this god
[1:32:14] that you're worshipping but the god of
[1:32:17] john you know
[1:32:18] you're the god of israel he doesn't have
[1:32:19] leprosy anymore
[1:32:21] and you can see in his life that he's
[1:32:23] just going through the motions now
[1:32:25] yeah because he is being he's he he
[1:32:28] feels obligated to come with you to
[1:32:30] worship at this place
[1:32:32] it would kind of ring a bit hollow
[1:32:34] wouldn't it
[1:32:35] because you're worshiping this god of
[1:32:37] syria who's all mighty and great
[1:32:38] but he can't heal a single person and
[1:32:41] the god of israel does the impossible
[1:32:43] and now you've got living evidence right
[1:32:44] next to you hallelujah
[1:32:47] hallelujah it's like us you know the
[1:32:50] believer is living evidence
[1:32:52] that this book lives you want proof that
[1:32:55] jesus lives
[1:32:56] here it is hallelujah amen
[1:33:00] hallelujah i like that
[1:33:03] you just think about how empty that
[1:33:04] worship would be
[1:33:06] you're worshiping this idol and this guy
[1:33:08] wasn't healed by this idol we went to
[1:33:10] the real god now you're here and he's
[1:33:11] here and
[1:33:13] hallelujah you know you couldn't turn to
[1:33:14] him say what a great service that was
[1:33:16] he said no it may be all lights and
[1:33:19] flashing bang and music but there's
[1:33:20] nothing to it
[1:33:23] hallelujah remember the gospel glows
[1:33:26] hollywood shines but the gospel glows
[1:33:28] with humility amen
[1:33:30] hallelujah there was a man who was born
[1:33:34] blind
[1:33:36] he was healed by jesus i'll just read
[1:33:39] this i just find it
[1:33:41] his um his parents asked them and said
[1:33:43] we know
[1:33:45] that this is our son that he was born
[1:33:47] blind but by what means he seeth we know
[1:33:49] not
[1:33:50] or who hath opened his eyes we know not
[1:33:52] for years of age ask him he shall speak
[1:33:54] for himself
[1:33:56] these words spake his parents because
[1:33:57] they fed the jews now if that happened
[1:33:59] to them they wouldn't have been afraid
[1:34:01] to testify
[1:34:03] right because it happened yo you can't
[1:34:04] argue with the testimony
[1:34:06] i was once this way i'm now this way i
[1:34:09] was once walking the opposite direction
[1:34:11] to the word now i'm just walking with
[1:34:12] the word what did it
[1:34:15] he did it i was dead amen
[1:34:18] and sin now i'm alive in christ
[1:34:20] hallelujah i was dead in trespasses now
[1:34:23] i've been quickened by the holy ghost
[1:34:24] now i see him living in my life i see
[1:34:26] him change my family i see him working
[1:34:28] mightily
[1:34:29] i don't know how this worked it just
[1:34:30] worked
[1:34:33] yes my brother ran we saw the vision of
[1:34:34] the third pool the great tent but within
[1:34:36] that tent was that little room
[1:34:38] so i'll meet you in there people came
[1:34:40] and crippled and whatever more
[1:34:41] there's a reporter there trying to see
[1:34:42] what was going on because it couldn't be
[1:34:44] explained
[1:34:44] and they walked out healed and the
[1:34:47] report said well what happened to you
[1:34:48] and they said i don't know i went in
[1:34:49] there and he
[1:34:50] and the lord was in there and i just got
[1:34:51] changed here i am you know and
[1:34:53] you may not believe it but i'm walking
[1:34:54] now and we went and crippled hallelujah
[1:34:57] some people had to literally pack us in
[1:35:00] hallelujah carry us in a stretch or
[1:35:02] whatever more but then the lord came in
[1:35:04] his word
[1:35:05] met us in that secret place and we walk
[1:35:07] out well what
[1:35:08] what happened to you well jesus happened
[1:35:10] to me you know i mean
[1:35:12] you can't explain it as much as i wish i
[1:35:14] could explain
[1:35:15] what he did in my heart you can't fully
[1:35:18] explain it
[1:35:21] hallelujah but we should still speak to
[1:35:22] the wonderful things he has done
[1:35:26] amen by what so these yes so these words
[1:35:30] uh spake his parents because they fed
[1:35:32] the jews for the jews had agreed already
[1:35:34] if any man did confess that he was
[1:35:35] christ
[1:35:36] he should be put out of the synagogue
[1:35:38] therefore saith his parents he is of age
[1:35:40] ask him
[1:35:45] then again uh called they the man that
[1:35:47] was blind and said unto him give god the
[1:35:48] praise we know that this man is a sinner
[1:35:51] he answered and said whether he's a
[1:35:52] sinner or no i know not one thing i know
[1:35:55] that whereas i was blind now i see you
[1:35:57] know people say a lot of things about
[1:35:58] brother braham and the message well
[1:36:00] one thing i know i was lost now i'm
[1:36:02] found one thing i know i i there was
[1:36:04] nothing in me that really wanted the
[1:36:05] lord but now
[1:36:06] all i want is him
[1:36:11] then they said to him again did what did
[1:36:14] he to thee
[1:36:16] how he opened thine eyes what did he
[1:36:18] preach what kind of doctrine was it
[1:36:22] you know you can't you can't put into
[1:36:23] words he answered them
[1:36:25] but the word became clear yeah yeah
[1:36:28] hallelujah this book became a new book
[1:36:29] amen
[1:36:30] amen he answered them i've told you
[1:36:32] already and you did not hear
[1:36:34] wherefore would you hear it again will
[1:36:36] he also be his disciples
[1:36:38] then they reviled him and said thou art
[1:36:40] his disciple but we
[1:36:41] are moses disciple it's very easy to for
[1:36:44] people to believe in a god that was
[1:36:46] what about the god that is amen we know
[1:36:49] that
[1:36:49] god spake unto moses but as for this
[1:36:51] fellow we know not from whence he is
[1:36:54] and they received it out of tradition
[1:36:55] not out of revelation
[1:36:57] amen the man answered and said unto them
[1:37:00] why heron is a marvelous thing
[1:37:02] that you know not from whence he is and
[1:37:03] yet he hath opened my eyes
[1:37:05] now we know that god heareth not sinners
[1:37:07] but if any man be a worshiper of god and
[1:37:09] doeth his will he heareth
[1:37:11] him he heareth it says the world began
[1:37:14] was it not heard that any man opened the
[1:37:16] eyes of him that was born blind
[1:37:18] if this man were not of god he could do
[1:37:20] nothing that's right
[1:37:22] you know brother brown would be there in
[1:37:23] a prayer line there's a little girl
[1:37:24] there brother billy paul tells it had no
[1:37:26] eyes
[1:37:28] and and she said i want i want eyes
[1:37:31] they were praying brother ram stops and
[1:37:33] the prince is what color eyes do you
[1:37:34] want
[1:37:35] i think she said blue i can't remember a
[1:37:37] couple of blue streaks came down she got
[1:37:39] blue eyes
[1:37:41] hallelujah i believe it was um
[1:37:44] jack co i might have his name wrong but
[1:37:46] he was he was an evangelist and and
[1:37:48] and the first meeting he went into man
[1:37:50] didn't even have eyes brother ram said
[1:37:51] in three days you'll see
[1:37:53] amen amen so so this man jet co uh yo he
[1:37:56] he he followed this man around in three
[1:38:00] days their eyes
[1:38:01] um eyeballs you know you know eyeballs
[1:38:03] in the sockets at the end of those three
[1:38:04] days you could see
[1:38:07] what do you do about that i don't know
[1:38:11] hallelujah so now here we are on this
[1:38:14] end time
[1:38:15] as i said in the beginning the bride has
[1:38:18] come to her maturity
[1:38:19] it's very easy to look at the world
[1:38:21] because remember the wheat and the tears
[1:38:22] they mature together
[1:38:24] the tears are bound for the burning but
[1:38:26] the weed is gathered to the ghana now
[1:38:28] it's very easy to look in the world and
[1:38:29] say this world is mature
[1:38:31] and it's sin right amen it's all come to
[1:38:35] its maturity and we look at that say oh
[1:38:37] boy this world has come to its climax
[1:38:39] but what about the bride of christ what
[1:38:41] about the wheat
[1:38:43] i mean because they both got to come to
[1:38:44] maturity they both got to come to a
[1:38:46] harvest condition
[1:38:47] and many times we look at ourselves and
[1:38:49] say lord how can i ever be made in your
[1:38:51] image
[1:38:52] but we've already been made in his image
[1:38:54] i think we're further down the road with
[1:38:55] the lord than we think we are
[1:38:57] because we keep looking at our faults
[1:38:59] and our failures and our
[1:39:00] our trip ups and things we do wrong but
[1:39:02] the lord doesn't allocate those to us
[1:39:04] because of his blood he doesn't allocate
[1:39:06] those things to us right and he can
[1:39:08] actually see
[1:39:09] if we could look through his eyes we
[1:39:10] would actually see the bride is actually
[1:39:12] pretty ripe
[1:39:14] pretty mature because he's not going to
[1:39:17] harvest the people
[1:39:19] you don't harvest wheat that's half
[1:39:20] grown that's a silly farmer that's right
[1:39:23] why are you harvesting you gotta wait
[1:39:25] for it to come to its golden head and
[1:39:26] you know
[1:39:27] all the greenness is baked out of it now
[1:39:29] it's now it's ready for harvest
[1:39:31] it's the same thing with you and i see
[1:39:32] see when we come to that golden stage
[1:39:34] brother graham says that the
[1:39:36] that the wheat just needs to land the
[1:39:37] presence of the sun and that's what we
[1:39:39] have been doing that's why the sunlight
[1:39:41] has been getting stronger you know
[1:39:43] we know that the light that that that
[1:39:45] shines in a harvest time
[1:39:46] is not the same as a greater strength of
[1:39:48] the sun than when you plant the wheat
[1:39:51] because if you if that strength of the
[1:39:53] sun is shining when you plant the wheat
[1:39:55] it'll kill the plant
[1:39:56] but then when the but but as the plant
[1:39:58] grows the sunlight gets stronger
[1:40:01] until it's down to its harvest condition
[1:40:03] i mean so now as we've been walking with
[1:40:05] the lord through these years amen
[1:40:07] the sunlight has been getting stronger i
[1:40:10] mean there's been a greater quickening
[1:40:11] going on
[1:40:12] the form and the latter rain are running
[1:40:14] together
[1:40:15] harley the teaching and the quickening
[1:40:17] rain the the two anointings that have
[1:40:19] fallen having fallen together
[1:40:21] and i can say that because us who just
[1:40:22] came into the message just a couple of
[1:40:24] years ago literally we are right there
[1:40:26] in revelation with those who've been in
[1:40:28] the message
[1:40:28] for 40 years why because there's a
[1:40:31] quickening going on
[1:40:33] hallelujah isn't that wonderful i think
[1:40:36] that's great he says just lay in the
[1:40:37] presence of the sun that's why it's so
[1:40:39] important to have a spiritual atmosphere
[1:40:40] in your home
[1:40:41] a spiritual atmosphere on the job
[1:40:43] wherever you may be just be in his
[1:40:45] presence
[1:40:45] the lord can drop things on your heart
[1:40:47] bring his word forth i mean you can have
[1:40:49] a communion with
[1:40:50] god you can be walking down the road you
[1:40:51] can be at school at your job you can be
[1:40:53] anywhere in god
[1:40:54] speaks to you ministers to you
[1:40:56] hallelujah and we can live in that kind
[1:40:58] of atmosphere because that's the
[1:40:59] atmosphere we're built to live in
[1:41:01] amen why do you think this world is so
[1:41:04] hyper
[1:41:05] you know hyper connected
[1:41:08] right it used to be once upon a time you
[1:41:10] know i remember we had a phone
[1:41:12] when i was young that you you you turned
[1:41:14] the turn that you
[1:41:16] turned the thing around it would you
[1:41:17] know your dial numbers
[1:41:19] yes hallelujah we used to have floppy
[1:41:22] disks
[1:41:22] yeah that's right and they're not safe
[1:41:25] icons
[1:41:26] jayden looks at me what's up lobby they
[1:41:28] probably know what it is but you know
[1:41:29] some people you know at work there's my
[1:41:31] old job we found some floppy disks
[1:41:33] or the small hard ones you have the
[1:41:34] compactors whatever you call it and they
[1:41:36] took them
[1:41:37] so not me but some others took them to
[1:41:39] the younger members of staff and say do
[1:41:40] you know what this
[1:41:41] is and some of them had to think for a
[1:41:43] while because i'd never seen one before
[1:41:45] apart from a save icon
[1:41:49] you know so those things but now so
[1:41:52] we've gone from that where was
[1:41:54] dial-up internet phone calls or
[1:41:55] landlines unless you had some brick
[1:41:57] phone
[1:41:58] now i can now i can talk to the whole
[1:42:00] world
[1:42:01] and we can have a multi-you know
[1:42:03] multi-site video conference call
[1:42:05] it's all hyper-connected and part of
[1:42:07] that hey the devil's
[1:42:09] made the technology we can use it
[1:42:10] against him but in the same token it can
[1:42:13] make us so busy and so caught up in
[1:42:15] things
[1:42:16] i mean that we that we can lose our
[1:42:17] fellowship with god
[1:42:19] so we need these things to be in all all
[1:42:21] things in moderation
[1:42:23] in the right balance
[1:42:26] because it's here you can't go be a monk
[1:42:28] in some monastery somewhere and shut the
[1:42:30] world out how can you be how can you go
[1:42:32] and tell
[1:42:32] if you're up on the mountain somewhere
[1:42:35] right we don't want to make some kind of
[1:42:37] cult that kind of just
[1:42:38] builds up some walls and keeps the world
[1:42:39] out no no we're told to go
[1:42:41] tell amen a lot of his disciples don't
[1:42:44] know their disciples
[1:42:46] i didn't know i was a disciple until
[1:42:49] hallelujah he said go
[1:42:50] tell and someone came and told me amen
[1:42:56] but now we hear the time of a harvest
[1:42:58] time
[1:43:00] brother and says in the sea does not air
[1:43:02] with the shook she was not the seed mary
[1:43:04] was not
[1:43:05] just a shooker tassel and stalk carriers
[1:43:07] are part of the word not all the word
[1:43:09] luther had justification weirdly wesley
[1:43:11] had sanctification pentecostals had the
[1:43:13] restoration of the gifts
[1:43:15] but when the word come now they could
[1:43:17] produce that justification will save a
[1:43:19] man you believe that
[1:43:20] we still believe that today don't we
[1:43:23] hallelujah
[1:43:24] sure it was a carrier of the word just
[1:43:26] the same as i believe the stalk is part
[1:43:28] of the wheat
[1:43:29] sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't
[1:43:31] the life then came along sanctification
[1:43:33] how many believes in sanctification
[1:43:35] you believe the bible you have to sure
[1:43:37] so still that's not that's just a little
[1:43:39] more that's two more words
[1:43:44] but then come the pentecost the
[1:43:45] restoration of the gifts speaking in
[1:43:47] tongues they call it the initial
[1:43:48] evidence of the holy ghost speaking in
[1:43:49] tongues there
[1:43:50] they call that the initial evidence
[1:43:52] which brought forth
[1:43:54] the what the shock but they denominated
[1:43:56] but when you come to say i and my father
[1:43:59] are one
[1:43:59] yes this should be our testimony
[1:44:02] i and my father are one in that day ye
[1:44:05] shall know that i am in you you and me
[1:44:07] my father knew you and me right i my
[1:44:09] father are one
[1:44:11] and these things then the shack pulls
[1:44:13] away from it but the real genuine bride
[1:44:15] church will bring forth the entire word
[1:44:17] of god
[1:44:18] in its fullness and in its strength for
[1:44:20] he's the same yesterday
[1:44:21] today and forever hallelujah we're here
[1:44:25] to bring forth the full strength of the
[1:44:26] full word of god
[1:44:28] to manifest it amen to bring forth the
[1:44:31] entire word of god
[1:44:32] so not just justification not just
[1:44:34] sanctification
[1:44:35] not just the gifts of the spirit but the
[1:44:37] whole thing together
[1:44:39] hallelujah this is what we've got to go
[1:44:41] and tell that's why we can say
[1:44:43] i serve a living god jesus christ is
[1:44:46] alive and he does actually transform
[1:44:47] people's lives
[1:44:48] it's not seven steps to becoming a
[1:44:50] christian it's actually you just meet
[1:44:52] him and he'll make you the christian
[1:44:53] to repent and be baptized name the lord
[1:44:55] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:44:57] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:44:58] holy ghost
[1:45:00] hallelujah i'm so glad it's that way
[1:45:03] hallelujah amen jesus himself taught
[1:45:05] that this would happen
[1:45:07] and he said so is the kingdom of god as
[1:45:09] if a man should cast seed into the
[1:45:10] ground
[1:45:11] and and should sleep and rise night and
[1:45:13] day and seed should spring forth and
[1:45:16] grow up he knows not how
[1:45:17] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[1:45:19] herself first the blade
[1:45:20] justification then the air
[1:45:22] sanctification
[1:45:23] after that the full corn in the air
[1:45:26] and when the fruit is brought forth
[1:45:28] immediately he pulled he he
[1:45:30] put us in the sickle because the harvest
[1:45:31] has come
[1:45:33] that's the restoration it's actually in
[1:45:35] the scripture
[1:45:36] hallelujah and here we are we where are
[1:45:39] we when the fruit is brought forth
[1:45:42] hallelujah that's why you should be able
[1:45:43] to read the scripture and see the same
[1:45:45] life that's in the word
[1:45:46] is in you the same book of acts same
[1:45:49] things
[1:45:49] happen in the book of acts you see it in
[1:45:51] your life the same character that christ
[1:45:52] had
[1:45:53] when you read the sermon on the mount i
[1:45:55] trust you can see yourself in the sermon
[1:45:57] on the mount
[1:45:58] blessed are the meek blessed the
[1:45:59] peacemaker blessed all these ones
[1:46:02] you should be able to see the life
[1:46:03] you're living you should see it in the
[1:46:04] sermon on the mount
[1:46:05] why because the one that gave the
[1:46:07] servant the one that gave the sermon and
[1:46:09] the mount is in you
[1:46:11] hallelujah that's how it should be love
[1:46:14] your enemies
[1:46:15] amen amen bless them that despitefully
[1:46:18] use you
[1:46:19] amen glory we should be that way
[1:46:23] yes it's easy to love those that love
[1:46:24] you but what about those who don't love
[1:46:26] you
[1:46:27] i mean if the capstone of divine love
[1:46:28] has come upon our lives we should love
[1:46:30] those who don't love us
[1:46:32] we should pray for those who despisely
[1:46:34] use us shouldn't we be that way
[1:46:36] we shouldn't be looking for revenge and
[1:46:38] serve some right kind of times though we
[1:46:40] should pray for them
[1:46:41] from our hearts not because we're taught
[1:46:43] to you know
[1:46:45] anyway that's how it should be we should
[1:46:48] have such a life in our
[1:46:49] it should be such the life of god should
[1:46:51] be flowing because if we are
[1:46:52] if we are now in a ripened in a in a
[1:46:54] harvest condition
[1:46:56] laying in the presence of the sun then
[1:46:57] all the greenness of our humanity should
[1:46:59] be baked out pretty much
[1:47:01] and that golden deity should come forth
[1:47:02] what is that that's the love of god
[1:47:04] manifested yes that's right
[1:47:06] hallelujah and that's not a wishy-washy
[1:47:07] i love you kind of love no it's a real
[1:47:09] genuine love
[1:47:10] that goes beyond feeling amen amen
[1:47:13] because of the if it's the love of god
[1:47:14] in you
[1:47:15] and that person doesn't love you you
[1:47:17] will love them because it's not based on
[1:47:19] what they do to you but the redeeming
[1:47:20] love in you wants to go to them you
[1:47:22] don't want to see them in their pit
[1:47:24] you don't want to see them in their
[1:47:25] conflicts and their condition and their
[1:47:26] malice and their trouble
[1:47:27] but you want them to be lifted up and
[1:47:29] lifted and friends of god and god will
[1:47:30] change their lives
[1:47:31] isn't that what we want to see
[1:47:33] hallelujah isn't it a glorious thing
[1:47:35] when you're it's incredible to see
[1:47:37] you know we pray for a physical healing
[1:47:39] and god comes on the scene that's a
[1:47:41] wonderful glorious thing
[1:47:43] but holy isn't it more of a wonderful
[1:47:44] glorious thing where someone's life has
[1:47:46] changed
[1:47:47] so is maybe crippled up and so angry and
[1:47:49] fighting and fussing and trouble
[1:47:50] whatever but now they're just so loving
[1:47:53] so peaceful
[1:47:54] the whole character's been made
[1:47:55] different hallelujah that's the kind of
[1:47:57] healing that i want to see
[1:48:00] but that's being in a different
[1:48:01] atmosphere than the then than the
[1:48:03] atmosphere in the world
[1:48:04] because the atmosphere in the world is
[1:48:06] dog-eat-dog what can i get out of you
[1:48:08] and i'll use you until i'm done and then
[1:48:10] i'll find someone else that's that's how
[1:48:12] the world works
[1:48:13] that's the problem with you know dating
[1:48:15] and relationships whatever more it's all
[1:48:16] about what can i get
[1:48:19] we'll get into that tonight i promise
[1:48:22] promised my life i wouldn't mention any
[1:48:23] of this stuff
[1:48:24] this morning yeah but you know it's all
[1:48:26] about what can i get
[1:48:27] and if it doesn't work you see it in
[1:48:29] business it works for me well then i'll
[1:48:30] do business with you because it works
[1:48:31] for me
[1:48:32] but in the christian world if it doesn't
[1:48:35] work for me i'll still work for you
[1:48:37] i'll still do it for you because i just
[1:48:38] should be redeeming love in my life
[1:48:43] you know it's very easy to it's very
[1:48:45] easy to hang around those that you enjoy
[1:48:47] to hang around
[1:48:49] but what about those who you find it
[1:48:51] hard to fellowship with
[1:48:53] what about those ones remember we are
[1:48:55] are we will not one body
[1:48:59] if my you know if i i
[1:49:02] used to have an ingrown toenail when i
[1:49:04] was at uh school
[1:49:07] you never notice your toenails until you
[1:49:08] need to cut them
[1:49:10] but then when you get an ingrown toenail
[1:49:12] you notice it all the time
[1:49:15] because there's a pain in the body
[1:49:17] something's not right something's been
[1:49:18] rubbing
[1:49:19] and now there's a problem right but i
[1:49:22] don't cut my toe off i don't put some
[1:49:23] kind of
[1:49:24] you know i don't i don't get rid of my
[1:49:26] toe just because i've got
[1:49:28] ingrown toenail i want that fixed it it
[1:49:31] bothers me that it's not fine
[1:49:33] and it should be the same thing with you
[1:49:34] and i if we see someone go through
[1:49:36] something
[1:49:37] it's not now i need all the details
[1:49:38] should be lo you should be interceding
[1:49:40] we should be interceding for one another
[1:49:41] and because that's part we're all part
[1:49:43] of the same body
[1:49:44] if one part suffers we all suffer if one
[1:49:47] part is doing well we're all doing well
[1:49:49] hallelujah amen oh isn't it blessed to
[1:49:53] be part of the family of god hallelujah
[1:49:58] now
[1:50:03] now christ in this day that we live in
[1:50:05] is still deity identifying himself deity
[1:50:07] among the people he's still deity
[1:50:09] because he is the word and when we see
[1:50:11] the word living itself
[1:50:13] then we know that man can't do that it's
[1:50:16] deity the word being made manifest by
[1:50:18] man jesus said himself
[1:50:20] the son can do nothing in himself i
[1:50:22] can't do nothing i'm a man jesus here
[1:50:23] but my father that dwelleth in me
[1:50:26] he showeth me all things that himself
[1:50:28] doeth amen there you are what is it
[1:50:30] deity being identified in man now the
[1:50:33] same thing is today that deity the
[1:50:35] promised word for this day
[1:50:37] can identify itself in you
[1:50:41] hallelujah amen then you give your whole
[1:50:44] to it
[1:50:45] show that you believe in it give it
[1:50:47] deity believe it serve it and be ready
[1:50:49] to die out to yourself
[1:50:51] pardon me and your own thoughts but
[1:50:52] today it's rejected as it was then
[1:50:56] amen but when you see that promised word
[1:50:58] what is the promised word of this day
[1:50:59] that a people will grow into the
[1:51:00] fullness of the statue of christ
[1:51:02] she is him brother abraham says the
[1:51:04] bride is him
[1:51:06] because we are no longer ourselves it's
[1:51:08] no longer either liveth but christ that
[1:51:10] liveth in me
[1:51:11] that's why that's why he can say that
[1:51:12] she is him because she is so dead she's
[1:51:14] not living herself
[1:51:15] but the word has put on flesh in her i
[1:51:17] mean that her whole identity is in the
[1:51:19] word
[1:51:20] it's not her own identity it's in the
[1:51:22] word right hallelujah and that's and
[1:51:24] that's how we should be
[1:51:26] amen amen my identity is not the with my
[1:51:29] first birth
[1:51:31] my identity is in the message of the
[1:51:32] hours the living word of god amen
[1:51:34] yes sir amen hallelujah
[1:51:38] jesus said these words and afterwards he
[1:51:41] appeared unto 11 as they said
[1:51:44] um at meat i won't be too much longer
[1:51:47] and
[1:51:47] uprighted them with their unbelief and
[1:51:49] hardness of heart because they believed
[1:51:50] not them which had seen him after he was
[1:51:53] risen
[1:51:54] and they said unto them go into all the
[1:51:56] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:51:57] creature
[1:51:58] amen every creature you can you can
[1:52:01] preach the gospel because the
[1:52:02] because the gospel is the pound
[1:52:04] demonstration of the holy ghost
[1:52:06] right so you can you can speak to the
[1:52:08] storm you can speak to nature
[1:52:10] amen hallelujah i had times in papua new
[1:52:13] guinea when you know
[1:52:14] when when i used to go up there in the
[1:52:16] summer time well our summer time it's
[1:52:18] their monsoon season
[1:52:19] i know i've probably seen this before
[1:52:20] but i'll i'll say it again you know and
[1:52:22] and so there'd be heaps of like it would
[1:52:24] rain not like here
[1:52:26] it would rain like monsoon rain is the
[1:52:28] next level thing
[1:52:29] and and what would happen is as as the
[1:52:31] church where past emas is
[1:52:33] it's it's out in the village you need a
[1:52:34] 4x4 to get there on a good day and if
[1:52:36] it's raining you it's very hard to get
[1:52:38] in around
[1:52:39] and so this and then what would happen
[1:52:41] is normally in the morning time would be
[1:52:42] sunny
[1:52:43] and then then dark clouds would come
[1:52:45] over just buck it down for the rest of
[1:52:47] the day
[1:52:47] and then maybe that rain would last you
[1:52:50] know a few days so so
[1:52:51] whenever they you know i would not be
[1:52:53] i'd either be in total
[1:52:54] at the church or i'd be at my parents
[1:52:56] place but i need to get there or come
[1:52:58] home
[1:52:59] i'd say and and and then rain would
[1:53:01] begin to fall i'd say lord
[1:53:03] send the rain away i need to i need to
[1:53:04] travel what happened the rain would go
[1:53:06] away
[1:53:07] and i came back to new zealand after the
[1:53:09] mission trip and i emailed my mum how
[1:53:11] things are going
[1:53:12] and she said well the roads are just
[1:53:13] like rivers
[1:53:16] we can we can ask the lord to move
[1:53:18] things around
[1:53:19] we can can't we you know how many how
[1:53:21] many testimonies of south africa people
[1:53:23] praying for crops and you know rain to
[1:53:24] come and think
[1:53:25] and it happens well that's faith
[1:53:27] hallelujah
[1:53:29] amen amen he that believeth is baptized
[1:53:32] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[1:53:33] shall be damned
[1:53:34] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:53:36] believe
[1:53:38] these signs shall follow them that go
[1:53:39] tell amen
[1:53:41] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:53:42] they shall speak with you tongues
[1:53:44] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:53:45] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:53:47] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:53:48] and they shall recover
[1:53:50] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[1:53:51] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:53:53] said on the right hand of god
[1:53:55] and they went forth and preached
[1:53:56] everywhere the lord working with him and
[1:53:59] confirming the word with signs
[1:54:00] following amen amen now you don't have
[1:54:04] to be a preacher for the
[1:54:05] for for signs to follow hallelujah you
[1:54:08] don't have to be a preacher for the lord
[1:54:10] to confirm the word
[1:54:12] you can be testifying to someone and
[1:54:14] then the lord will come down
[1:54:15] supernaturally and confirm that word to
[1:54:16] them
[1:54:17] i mean for those people to see what
[1:54:18] you're saying is not man's idea it's
[1:54:20] god's word
[1:54:22] hallelujah so that's how we go tell the
[1:54:24] lord confirms the word i love that last
[1:54:26] verse
[1:54:27] you know people say and and and it's in
[1:54:29] some
[1:54:30] footer notes in some bibles that um
[1:54:34] these verses are not in the original
[1:54:36] manuscripts
[1:54:37] but irenaeus quoted it and also brother
[1:54:41] brown you know gives a story of a you
[1:54:42] know
[1:54:43] of a of a lady that that had had i think
[1:54:46] one son and that son went to a bible
[1:54:48] college and
[1:54:48] and while he was away at bible college
[1:54:51] you know
[1:54:52] he received a telegram from her mom that
[1:54:54] she was very sick needs to come home
[1:54:55] real soon
[1:54:56] and then no news came and he didn't go
[1:54:58] home and then like a year later he went
[1:54:59] home and his mom's fine
[1:55:01] and so she asked her i mean he he asked
[1:55:04] her rather
[1:55:05] mum what happened you know you sent word
[1:55:07] that i was you know that you're really
[1:55:08] sick but now you're well and
[1:55:10] and she said well you know i was i was
[1:55:12] really sick that's why i sent you the
[1:55:13] telegram but
[1:55:14] but i got a knock on the door one day
[1:55:16] and there's a lady from that you know
[1:55:18] you know you're a christian lady and
[1:55:20] said that we were praying you know we
[1:55:21] had a little prayer meeting and and the
[1:55:23] lord put it on my heart to come talk to
[1:55:25] you
[1:55:25] because i want you know would it be okay
[1:55:27] if you come speak with my pastor because
[1:55:29] we believe god's real
[1:55:31] and then and then he you know and then
[1:55:33] so he read
[1:55:35] he read to me out of the scripture they
[1:55:37] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:55:38] shall recover
[1:55:39] and they prayed for me in order to you
[1:55:41] know anointed me with oil according to
[1:55:42] the word different things
[1:55:44] you know and hallelujah i'm healed and
[1:55:46] and and he said to her well you know
[1:55:48] don't you know that last part of john
[1:55:50] that you're referring to is not inspired
[1:55:52] and she just says praise the lord and
[1:55:54] and he says mother what's wrong with you
[1:55:56] begin to act like those people in that
[1:55:57] mission you went to
[1:55:59] and and she said well praise the lord
[1:56:00] you know if that's not inspired and god
[1:56:02] he'll be with it what can god do with
[1:56:03] the inspired word
[1:56:05] but we know the entire word is inspired
[1:56:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:12] hallelujah now
[1:56:16] a momentary consideration of church
[1:56:18] history will prove how accurate this
[1:56:20] thought is
[1:56:21] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:56:22] entirely lost to the people
[1:56:24] they're speaking of restoration now but
[1:56:26] god sent luther with the word the
[1:56:27] lutheran spoke for god at that time but
[1:56:29] they organized and again the pure word
[1:56:31] was lost for organization
[1:56:33] tends towards dogma and creeds and not
[1:56:35] the simple word
[1:56:36] they could no longer speak for god then
[1:56:38] god sent weasley and he was the voice
[1:56:40] with
[1:56:41] with the word in his day the people who
[1:56:43] took his revelation from god
[1:56:45] became the living epistles written on of
[1:56:47] all men for their generation
[1:56:49] when the methodists failed god raised up
[1:56:51] others and
[1:56:52] and so it has gone on through the years
[1:56:55] until on this last day there is again
[1:56:57] another people in the land who under
[1:56:59] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:57:00] to the final age
[1:57:02] that's talking about you by the way if
[1:57:04] you're thinking who are these people the
[1:57:05] final who will be under their messenger
[1:57:07] no we'll be the final voice of the final
[1:57:09] age that's you
[1:57:11] god has to have a living witness in
[1:57:12] every generation
[1:57:14] here you are in 20 21
[1:57:19] almost at 2012 i don't know how i got
[1:57:20] there yes sir the church is no longer
[1:57:23] the mouthpiece
[1:57:24] of god it is its own mouthpiece so god
[1:57:27] is turning on her
[1:57:28] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:57:29] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:57:31] be in her
[1:57:32] yes it is for it says in the last
[1:57:33] chapter of revelations verse 17.
[1:57:36] the spirit and the bride say come once
[1:57:38] more the world will hear direct from god
[1:57:40] as at pentecost but of course the word
[1:57:42] bride will be repudiated
[1:57:44] as in the last ages which is judged to
[1:57:46] be false
[1:57:47] but it's not false amen amen now
[1:57:51] he has cried out to this last age you
[1:57:53] have the word you are
[1:57:54] you have more bibles than ever but
[1:57:55] you're not doing anything about the word
[1:57:57] except dividing and hacking it into
[1:57:59] pieces
[1:57:59] taking what you want and leaving out
[1:58:01] what you don't want you're not
[1:58:03] interested in living it but debating it
[1:58:06] now i'm thinking
[1:58:07] but there's a there's a people who are
[1:58:09] not under this condition this is the
[1:58:10] ladies condition
[1:58:11] there's a people who are interested in
[1:58:13] living it and not debating it
[1:58:15] there are people who want the entire
[1:58:17] world because you think about it
[1:58:20] i've never seen at a at a wedding
[1:58:22] ceremony
[1:58:24] a bride marrying half a groom
[1:58:29] i'm talking about someone who's been
[1:58:30] surgically cut in half
[1:58:32] i've never seen that i've seen this
[1:58:35] entire you know sure there's people who
[1:58:36] don't have limbs and
[1:58:37] i'm i'm talking about someone who's been
[1:58:38] surgically cut in half
[1:58:41] maybe the bride only wants the head
[1:58:43] doesn't want the body i've never seen
[1:58:44] someone marry a head
[1:58:46] this sounds ridiculous but this is what
[1:58:47] people do with the scripture they only
[1:58:49] take the bits they want and they leave
[1:58:50] the bits they don't want what they're
[1:58:51] doing they're uniting themselves with
[1:58:53] part of the word which is not the whole
[1:58:56] bridegroom i want all of them
[1:58:58] i want all of jesus hallelujah
[1:59:02] amen so there's a people who are
[1:59:03] interested in living it and not debating
[1:59:05] it
[1:59:06] and the reason is they're interested in
[1:59:07] living it is because they see the
[1:59:09] potential in the word
[1:59:11] of what the lord does hallelujah
[1:59:14] amen that's why when we come to church
[1:59:16] we come under expectation because we see
[1:59:18] the potential of a meeting
[1:59:20] amen prayed up in our hearts all
[1:59:22] forgiveness gone i mean i mean all
[1:59:24] unforgiveness gone rather
[1:59:26] that's why we have the music playing
[1:59:28] beforehand
[1:59:29] we can come in and meditate and read the
[1:59:30] word and you know and that's why we have
[1:59:32] the music playing afterwards we can stay
[1:59:34] and pray
[1:59:35] i mean that's why we're interested in
[1:59:36] keeping a good atmosphere in the service
[1:59:39] because we see the potential of the
[1:59:40] service hallelujah
[1:59:42] do we not that's why that's the whole
[1:59:45] purpose of church georgia
[1:59:47] church order that god would come down
[1:59:49] and manifest himself
[1:59:50] that's why we see the potential of it i
[1:59:52] mean we see the potential of prayer
[1:59:54] meetings now you probably can't see that
[1:59:55] very well sorry
[1:59:56] but here's peter i thought a picture you
[1:59:58] know because all i do is put
[2:00:00] you know here's peter and he's chained
[2:00:02] to the two guards
[2:00:04] they had prayer meeting for him in that
[2:00:05] day because they saw the potential
[2:00:08] of what god can do because they already
[2:00:10] had testimony that the disciples that
[2:00:13] were imprisoned got led out by an angel
[2:00:16] did they not before this it happened i
[2:00:18] mean so they came together and they
[2:00:20] prayed because they saw what the lord
[2:00:22] can do
[2:00:22] because they could go draw back from
[2:00:24] past experience and say hey
[2:00:26] these other brothers got set free out of
[2:00:28] prison by the lord
[2:00:29] peter's in prison he can be set free
[2:00:31] sure they want to cut his head off but
[2:00:33] who says they'll have their way
[2:00:35] hallelujah why don't we just intercede
[2:00:37] and let god have his way
[2:00:38] and if god allows his head to be taken
[2:00:40] off that's god's will
[2:00:41] but if not praise the lord he's still
[2:00:43] got a work to do remember nothing can
[2:00:45] take our lives until we have served
[2:00:47] god's purpose
[2:00:48] hallelujah i mean so they came together
[2:00:51] because they could draw them past
[2:00:52] experience
[2:00:53] that the lord can get him out of prison
[2:00:55] now you just think about where we are in
[2:00:57] 2021
[2:00:57] we can draw back from all the
[2:00:59] testimonies there's ever been
[2:01:01] and we can say well the lord delivered
[2:01:04] this one
[2:01:05] and the lord healed that one and the
[2:01:06] lord set this one free
[2:01:08] come on friends just think about what we
[2:01:10] can draw we can see the potential and
[2:01:12] lord you don't change
[2:01:13] you're the same yesterday today and
[2:01:14] forever so if you can do it back there
[2:01:16] you can do it today
[2:01:18] if you can set him out of prison you can
[2:01:20] set people out of prison today
[2:01:22] hallelujah you know we've got uh
[2:01:24] brothers in china that are in prison
[2:01:26] for this message and they're being a
[2:01:28] living witness in prison
[2:01:30] hallelujah they're not letting their
[2:01:32] little you know
[2:01:34] their circumstances get them down
[2:01:35] they're going and telling
[2:01:37] yeah hallelujah hallelujah so you know
[2:01:40] we should see the potential that's why
[2:01:43] it's so important you know
[2:01:46] jesus is here and i think i'll do i have
[2:01:48] any pretty much going to close with this
[2:01:50] he says verily i sound to you whatsoever
[2:01:52] you bind on earth shall be bound in
[2:01:54] heaven
[2:01:55] and whatsoever you shall loose on earth
[2:01:56] shall be loosed in heaven this talking
[2:01:58] to you
[2:01:58] and again i send you if two of you shall
[2:02:01] agree on earth as touching
[2:02:03] thing yeah what's anything anything it's
[2:02:06] not limited to a certain things
[2:02:08] it's anything if then if
[2:02:11] that if two of you i just want to repeat
[2:02:13] this because this
[2:02:14] this blows my mind because the lord
[2:02:17] doesn't give a promise
[2:02:18] well given the ability to manifest that
[2:02:20] promise he doesn't put out empty words
[2:02:23] this is not motivational speak this is a
[2:02:25] reality his word is reality
[2:02:27] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[2:02:29] is touching anything
[2:02:30] that they shall ask it shall be done for
[2:02:33] them
[2:02:34] of my father which is in heaven
[2:02:38] anything two of you agree
[2:02:41] on earth amen hallelujah now that
[2:02:44] agreeing it means to be harmonious this
[2:02:47] is in the greek it means to be
[2:02:48] harmonious to be of a chord
[2:02:50] so it's more than just it's more than
[2:02:52] just agreeing in here we can mentally
[2:02:54] agree on a lot of things
[2:02:55] but we've got to agree in here amen
[2:02:58] so to me now because we see the
[2:03:00] potential of what god can do
[2:03:03] because he can do anything let's agree
[2:03:07] for our families
[2:03:08] let's agree let's agree for a revival
[2:03:12] let's agree let's agree to see that you
[2:03:14] know that the sick are healed
[2:03:16] amen let's agree for the lord to move in
[2:03:18] power let's agree for every promise in
[2:03:20] the word it's ours
[2:03:21] let's agree for a rapture let's agree
[2:03:23] from chronicles to come home
[2:03:25] let's agree for a refilling of the holy
[2:03:27] ghost let's agree
[2:03:29] well it doesn't matter if you're on the
[2:03:30] other side of the world you can't get
[2:03:32] them let's agree
[2:03:34] they couldn't get in prison and do it
[2:03:35] but god went in and did it
[2:03:38] hallelujah so let's agree that god can
[2:03:41] do anything
[2:03:42] that's why we should be in agreement
[2:03:43] that's why i say we're praying for one
[2:03:45] another
[2:03:46] we're praying for each other's families
[2:03:47] we're praying for their spiritual yo
[2:03:49] for their salvation for their
[2:03:51] deliverance whenever they be let's agree
[2:03:53] oh but you don't know who they are and
[2:03:54] this and it doesn't matter
[2:03:56] that's irrelevant yes hallelujah the
[2:03:58] prodigal son went a long way did a lot
[2:04:00] of things it didn't matter
[2:04:02] he had parents that were praying hold on
[2:04:03] children hallelujah
[2:04:06] but let's agree hallelujah amen amen no
[2:04:10] i'm not saying we don't but you know
[2:04:12] i believe in looking at people they
[2:04:13] actually want the best for each and
[2:04:14] every one of us
[2:04:15] yeah we're not trying to be better than
[2:04:17] i'm better than this family and better
[2:04:18] than these people and did it
[2:04:19] no this is not how we operate i don't
[2:04:21] think
[2:04:22] i believe we're in it to win it together
[2:04:24] amen
[2:04:27] amen but let's agree touching
[2:04:31] if two of you shall agree on earth as
[2:04:33] touching anything that ye shall ask it
[2:04:35] shall be done for them
[2:04:36] of my father which is in heaven
[2:04:39] and what's the burden on our hearts we
[2:04:41] want to see people saved amen
[2:04:43] i want to find that last one amen
[2:04:45] wouldn't that be cool
[2:04:47] that last one stumbles in this door is
[2:04:49] maybe sitting here right now
[2:04:50] they meet the lord we're going home amen
[2:04:54] amen hallelujah but whosoever will let
[2:04:57] them come
[2:04:57] yes sir amen
[2:05:00] he says he asks this question do you
[2:05:02] believe with all your heart the angel of
[2:05:04] the lord accompanies the message always
[2:05:06] that's why we can go and tell because
[2:05:08] the angel lord accompanies the message
[2:05:10] hallelujah have you made your decision
[2:05:12] that he's god
[2:05:13] then put your hands over on one another
[2:05:15] we don't want to wait till tomorrow
[2:05:17] night let it be tonight
[2:05:18] when the holy ghost spoke to me a few
[2:05:20] minutes ago i don't i didn't wait till
[2:05:22] tomorrow night tonight's the night for
[2:05:24] healing
[2:05:24] tonight's the night for forgiveness lay
[2:05:26] your hands over on one another
[2:05:28] so the angel of the lord accompanies the
[2:05:31] message always
[2:05:32] so when we go and tell it's not our own
[2:05:35] it's not the power of our persuasion
[2:05:37] it's not how we can articulate things
[2:05:39] it's
[2:05:40] he will confirm his word you say i don't
[2:05:43] know how to put it all together
[2:05:44] tell how your candle got lit people are
[2:05:47] looking for
[2:05:48] reality amen that's what they want they
[2:05:51] want reality
[2:05:52] and we have a reality to give them of a
[2:05:55] resurrected lord jesus christ who's
