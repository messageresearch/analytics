[48:24] of refuge and when david inquired of the
[48:27] lord and said
[48:29] thou shall not go up but feature compass
[48:31] behind them
[48:32] and come upon them over against the
[48:34] mulberry trees
[48:36] and let it be that when thou hearst the
[48:38] sound of a going
[48:39] in the top of the mulberry trees that
[48:42] then thou
[48:42] shalt bestow thyself for then shall the
[48:44] lord go out before thee
[48:46] to smite the host of the philistines and
[48:48] david did so as the lord commanded him
[48:51] and smote the philistines from giba
[48:53] until they'll go down to gazia amen
[48:55] hallelujah so and let's go to psalms 47
[48:58] we're going to read the whole psalm
[48:59] together um
[49:02] amen psalm 47 yep and we'll start from
[49:05] verse one here
[49:12] amen say amen when you're there or
[49:13] you've either turned or swiped or
[49:17] whatever you do so psalm 47 and verse 1
[49:21] says to the chief musician assam for the
[49:24] sons of korra
[49:26] oh clap your hands all ye people shout
[49:29] unto the lord with the voice of
[49:30] triumph i mean for the lord most high is
[49:34] terrible he is a great king over
[49:35] all the earth he shall subdue the people
[49:38] under us and nations under our feet now
[49:40] remember we're fighting against demon
[49:42] powers principalities and high places
[49:44] right
[49:45] so keep that in mind when we talk about
[49:46] the people shall be under our feet while
[49:48] the devil is going to be under our feet
[49:50] amen he shall choose our inheritance for
[49:53] us i like that don't you the lord
[49:54] chooses our inheritance it's not us
[49:56] choosing it
[49:56] it's him choosing it for us the
[49:58] excellency of jacob whom he loves sila
[50:01] god has gone up with a shout the lord
[50:03] with the sound of a trumpet
[50:05] sing praises to god sing praises and
[50:08] praises unto our king sing praises
[50:10] for god is the king of all the earth
[50:12] sing he praises with understanding and
[50:14] we know that this day we can sing with
[50:16] understanding
[50:17] amen god reigneth over the heathen god
[50:19] sitteth upon the throne of his holiness
[50:21] the princes of the people are gathered
[50:23] together even the people of the god of
[50:25] abraham
[50:26] for the shields of the earth belong unto
[50:29] god he is greatly exalted
[50:31] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[50:33] his word you may have your seats this
[50:35] morning
[50:36] um so i'd like to continue on
[50:40] uh where where i was speaking last
[50:42] sunday about of
[50:43] of a of a sound of a going and and david
[50:46] was instructed when he heard that
[50:47] sound uh of a going uh in the
[50:50] in the top of the mulberry trees that's
[50:52] when the time it was for him to
[50:54] to bestow himself and go and strike his
[50:56] enemy and we understand that we have
[50:58] heard the sound of it going that this
[51:00] message
[51:01] the rapture is really a secret going
[51:03] amen right
[51:04] is it coming but it's a secret going
[51:05] brother braham says it's actually a
[51:07] secret
[51:07] catching away of a bride amen and we
[51:10] understand that you know there is a
[51:11] people upon the earth
[51:13] that this will pass them by and they'll
[51:15] never know what happened but there's a
[51:16] people upon the earth that it won't pass
[51:17] them by
[51:18] and they'll be caught away hallelujah
[51:20] and i believe that's why we have
[51:21] gathered under the sound of the message
[51:23] amen in this days because we've heard
[51:24] the sound of it going
[51:26] it stirred us up amen and we
[51:27] understanding that we've been
[51:29] he's come to take us home hallelujah so
[51:32] now the sound we understand that every
[51:34] sound has a significance right
[51:36] every sound has a significance you know
[51:38] even even the whales when they call to
[51:41] each other it just sounds like a bunch
[51:42] of
[51:43] whale song to us but they're talking to
[51:45] each other
[51:46] the elephants trumpeting the birds
[51:48] chirping you know the beatles doing what
[51:50] they do you know
[51:50] everything has a significance every
[51:52] sound has a significance
[51:54] i mean it is it is it is speaking
[51:56] something
[51:58] amen and and the apostle paul would
[52:00] would speak about this
[52:02] you know i want to go into today we've
[52:04] heard the sound but you know what it
[52:05] means
[52:06] are you trying to hear the sound right
[52:09] because you know
[52:10] there's a lot of sounds you know there's
[52:11] a like like at work there's heaps of
[52:13] alarms
[52:14] there's alarms for freezers there's
[52:16] alarms for auction detectors there's
[52:18] alarms all kind of alarms
[52:19] but if you don't know what that alarm is
[52:21] for it could be catastrophic like get
[52:23] out of the building something's going to
[52:24] blow up
[52:25] you know but if you don't know what that
[52:26] sound is you just hear this
[52:29] you could just continue on but if you're
[52:31] trying to know what that sound is
[52:32] someone had to come along and say this
[52:34] allah means this this allah means this
[52:37] this sound means this
[52:39] and if you hear this do this if you hear
[52:40] this do that but if you don't know you
[52:42] just continue on in your daily
[52:44] daily daily life right so we need to be
[52:47] and
[52:48] and i pray that the lord would would
[52:50] would give us an ear to hear
[52:51] amen i mean what the spirit says to the
[52:54] church right and it doesn't become
[52:55] common to us
[52:56] we don't shut down to it but we're
[52:58] attentive when god speaks
[53:01] amen so so the apostle paul says in
[53:03] first corinthians 14 and 9
[53:05] he says so ye so likewise ye accept ye
[53:08] utter by the tongue words easily to be
[53:11] understood how shall be known
[53:13] what is spoken for ye shall speak into
[53:16] the air
[53:17] there are it may be so many kinds of
[53:20] voices in the world
[53:22] and none of them is without
[53:24] signification
[53:25] so there's many voices and there's many
[53:27] more voices today than there's ever been
[53:28] in the world
[53:29] i can well even now people have an
[53:33] internet connection they have a device
[53:34] they can watch the service
[53:36] and they can actually have subtitles
[53:38] going google
[53:40] youtube is clever enough that it can
[53:42] actually translate what i'm saying
[53:44] real time with subtitles and i know how
[53:46] many different languages
[53:47] it's about 95 accurate even with this
[53:50] hillbilly kiwi accent that i have
[53:53] right it can actually translate it so
[53:56] you know
[53:56] there's there's many voices today but
[53:59] we've got to be trained to hear the
[54:00] voice
[54:01] i mean because there's one voice that
[54:03] has the most significance in this age
[54:05] and we and i pray god remember this is
[54:07] not a human training there's a holy
[54:08] ghost training
[54:10] right and i pray the lord would train us
[54:12] so we're attentive
[54:13] and and i believe i'm looking at a tent
[54:15] of people they're
[54:16] they've heard the sound of a going and
[54:18] now they're ready to act upon that sound
[54:20] amen amen so every everything has
[54:24] every sound that is made has a reason
[54:26] for that sound
[54:28] he yo he also says the apostle paul
[54:30] would say in that same chapter
[54:32] he says others in verses 7 and 8 and
[54:34] even things without
[54:36] life giving sound whether pipe or harp
[54:39] except they give a distinction in in the
[54:41] sounds
[54:42] how shall it be known what is piped or
[54:44] harped for if a trumpet given uncertain
[54:47] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[54:50] battle
[54:51] now we understand that the apostle paul
[54:52] in his day is that on a battlefield or
[54:55] even
[54:56] even even outside the battlefield orders
[54:58] were given by
[54:59] by music you know there'll be a trumpet
[55:01] blonde even moses was commanded to
[55:03] to make the silver trumpets and a
[55:05] certain blow would be sounded on the
[55:07] trumpets it would be
[55:08] now let's march or make camp or the
[55:09] enemies here or do this you know
[55:11] it was that's how it was projected the
[55:13] message was given by
[55:15] through an instrument but if you didn't
[55:18] know what that instrument if that
[55:19] instrument did not give
[55:20] a certain sound then how could you
[55:23] prepare yourself for
[55:24] your you know for battle and and in the
[55:26] apostle paul's days i said that
[55:28] that orders were given in an army by by
[55:31] music
[55:32] now because you've got to remember
[55:34] imagine if we were in the roman legion
[55:36] and we're fighting the gauls or the huns
[55:38] or we're fighting somebody and we're
[55:40] up there and we're you know we're just
[55:41] the soldiers on the front line
[55:43] you know as the battle's going on we
[55:45] can't go to julius caesar and say julius
[55:48] what we meant to do again we can't go
[55:50] talk to him we've got to be standing in
[55:52] our rank we're going to be fighting when
[55:53] we're called
[55:54] because we know in a battle it's a fluid
[55:56] situation
[55:57] the plan that normally starts is not
[55:59] normally the plan that is finished with
[56:01] right because the enemy will do
[56:02] something you do something you know they
[56:04] do this and you gotta react accordingly
[56:06] so if we're not trained imagine if we're
[56:08] on the front rank
[56:10] you know and then and then we're told
[56:12] you know the captain would say okay boys
[56:14] you gotta hold this hill
[56:16] but then maybe there comes a time where
[56:17] we're gonna move from that hill
[56:19] but if we just stood they said no hold
[56:21] on we got told to stand here
[56:23] if we're not trained for that trumpet
[56:25] sound because that's how the orders
[56:26] would come from the general
[56:28] would be through a trumpet sound right
[56:30] and if we're not trained to hear that
[56:31] sound we wouldn't know okay now we
[56:33] charge
[56:34] or now we march forward or now we pull
[56:36] back or now we do this or you know
[56:38] we can't you can't go to the general and
[56:39] say now what are we doing again
[56:41] you had to be trained to hear the
[56:43] trumpet amen in the heat of the battle
[56:46] you could not ask the general what was
[56:49] the plan
[56:50] but you had to in the midst of the
[56:52] battle you had to keep your air out for
[56:54] that trumpet to blow
[56:55] even as you're taking some gaul's head
[56:57] off and you're fighting and deflecting
[56:59] sword blows or whatever more
[57:00] you had to keep your ear out because
[57:03] because the change in orders could come
[57:05] right and if you don't hear that
[57:07] changing orders you could be stuck
[57:09] and basically no man's land and be taken
[57:11] out but if you could keep your air open
[57:13] for that trumpet sound
[57:14] right if the order comes on now we've
[57:16] got a withdrawal then you withdraw with
[57:18] the rest of your unit
[57:19] amen it's the same thing in this battle
[57:21] you know we're not in a picnic
[57:23] i trust you've you know came to that
[57:25] realization we're on a battlefield right
[57:27] we've been
[57:28] we are the soldiers the soldiers of the
[57:30] lord amen
[57:31] hallelujah but we've got to even as
[57:33] we're fighting devils and you know
[57:35] overcoming every day
[57:36] we must keep our air open amen for the
[57:39] trumpet
[57:40] amen hallelujah amen that's right we
[57:43] have to do that
[57:47] brother brown would say and and trump it
[57:49] gives an uncertain sound
[57:52] it's a paul he was talking in
[57:54] corinthians 48 of of training of a
[57:56] soldier
[57:57] he's trained to assound that soldier if
[57:59] he's a trained soldier
[58:00] he knows every sound of that trumpet
[58:03] just exactly
[58:04] what to do and the infantry had to
[58:07] had they had certain trumpets and the
[58:09] cavalry had certain trumpets
[58:11] and you can't be an infantryman
[58:12] listening out for what the calvary is
[58:13] going to do
[58:15] because there's a bugle-blowing charge
[58:17] and if you charge with them hold on
[58:18] you're not meant to be doing that
[58:20] so we've got to be really lord make our
[58:23] hearts one with you
[58:25] so whatever your word says to do i'm
[58:27] just going to walk in unison with it
[58:30] i mean so so he's trained to astound
[58:32] that soldier
[58:33] if he's a trained soldier he knows every
[58:35] sound of that trumpet just exactly what
[58:37] to do
[58:38] he's trained to that trumpet when that
[58:40] trumpet sounds he
[58:41] he said if a trumpeter gives an
[58:43] uncertain sound then the soldier don't
[58:45] know what to do because he's only
[58:47] trained to the sound of a trumpet
[58:49] he knows exactly what to do because the
[58:51] trumpets telling him
[58:53] what to do he said now if the trumpet
[58:55] gives an uncertain sound that he don't
[58:56] know what to do
[58:58] now that was training a natural soldier
[59:02] and the christian soldiers trained to a
[59:04] trumpet amen a sound of a trumpet that's
[59:07] the gospel trumpet the gospel the sound
[59:09] of the word of god the gospel trumpet
[59:11] and if one
[59:12] never knew the sound of the gospel
[59:14] trumpet he would get a bit confused if
[59:16] he didn't know what the word said
[59:18] and what the word taught just what the
[59:20] church said he'd be a bit confused when
[59:22] he heard the sound of the trumpet
[59:24] he wouldn't know how to prepare himself
[59:26] and i think that's what we've got to the
[59:28] world today the trumpet is sounding
[59:30] exactly with the gospel
[59:32] and the people don't know how to act
[59:34] they don't know how to stand in line and
[59:35] make ready to battle
[59:37] they're confused because they've been
[59:38] listening to different trumpets
[59:41] creeds denominations secret sectarianism
[59:44] which is what we see in the world today
[59:46] this faction and this faction this
[59:48] political party this faction this
[59:50] movement
[59:50] it's all broken up all kinds of stuff he
[59:53] says
[59:54] and when the true gospel with the true
[59:56] word made manifest proved in there
[59:58] that people don't know what to do
[1:00:01] amen so we're living in that day so we
[1:00:03] have to be trained
[1:00:04] you know to to hear the sound of the
[1:00:06] trumpet now brother brown makes a very
[1:00:08] interesting comment
[1:00:09] where you know in that message we listen
[1:00:11] to the contest i trust this all kind of
[1:00:13] ties together
[1:00:14] you know it's kind of like cooking a lot
[1:00:15] of different ingredients and it goes in
[1:00:16] the pot then here it is so
[1:00:17] maybe we're cutting some carrots now but
[1:00:19] you know we'll get there now he says in
[1:00:21] the contest heavenly father as we stand
[1:00:23] here
[1:00:24] so many thoughts is dying out in our
[1:00:26] hearts and of the mistakes of last year
[1:00:28] and as we're approaching the death of 62
[1:00:30] in the birth of 63
[1:00:32] oh god may we be one step higher up the
[1:00:35] ladder
[1:00:36] until we see jesus and his program
[1:00:39] it's very vital that we see jesus and
[1:00:41] his program
[1:00:42] because if we don't see his program if
[1:00:44] we don't see him and we don't see his
[1:00:46] program we don't know what to do that's
[1:00:47] right
[1:00:48] where are we in the battle lord you know
[1:00:49] how's the campaign going you know you
[1:00:51] don't know what's going on but if you
[1:00:52] can see his program
[1:00:54] if you can see him in his program you
[1:00:56] can see this world through scriptural
[1:00:58] eyes
[1:00:59] and you won't get caught up in what's
[1:01:00] going on in the world and you can walk
[1:01:02] on with god
[1:01:04] hallelujah now now to say that you know
[1:01:06] we need to know see
[1:01:08] jesus in his program this is not a vague
[1:01:10] thing now this is actually for this is
[1:01:12] dessert for next sunday
[1:01:14] i just want to give you a foretaste but
[1:01:15] i want to get thinking about these
[1:01:17] things
[1:01:17] now to see god in his program
[1:01:21] or to see god in his word which is his
[1:01:23] program rather it's not a vague thing
[1:01:25] but if we fail to see it then we'll
[1:01:27] wander off into other things
[1:01:29] now the program of god for this age is
[1:01:32] laid out
[1:01:33] in a pattern from the ministry of john
[1:01:35] the baptist until the destruction of
[1:01:37] jerusalem
[1:01:38] that is the program of god is in there
[1:01:41] and and
[1:01:42] we're going to go into that maybe next
[1:01:44] sunday you see the political fighting of
[1:01:46] the jews with as titus was coming in
[1:01:48] everything going on
[1:01:49] that's just rinsing repeating as today
[1:01:51] but if you're caught up in what's going
[1:01:53] on you'll end up
[1:01:54] like the jews in jerusalem massacred
[1:01:58] but if you hear the gospel trumpet
[1:01:59] you'll leave when you hear when you see
[1:02:01] the voice of god the bible being
[1:02:03] manifested you'll run out of it as fast
[1:02:05] as you can
[1:02:06] and you'll be safe what's that running
[1:02:08] out a rapture
[1:02:10] so that's next sunday that's it thank
[1:02:13] you
[1:02:13] you know brother brown i've been i've
[1:02:15] been you know um
[1:02:17] he says that you know he he he relates
[1:02:19] dreams and visions there in services the
[1:02:20] time of the end 1962
[1:02:22] around the same time and he says that
[1:02:24] you know i think junior jackson had the
[1:02:26] dream where brother bram
[1:02:27] took that crowbar that wrecking bar and
[1:02:29] pulled the top off of the pyramid
[1:02:31] and it was that white rock that that
[1:02:33] sunlight never shone on
[1:02:34] and he said to the people look on this
[1:02:38] and then as junior jackson was was was
[1:02:40] watching brother brown
[1:02:41] he he went west he went somewhere
[1:02:44] and then a lot of people said where's
[1:02:45] the prophet gone where's he gone
[1:02:48] and many of them stopped looking on this
[1:02:49] and they wandered off
[1:02:52] they weren't looking at jesus in his
[1:02:54] program where's the profit gone
[1:02:56] oh there's a delay it's been 60 odd
[1:02:58] years what's going on
[1:03:00] and people wander off but they don't
[1:03:02] understand that it's all
[1:03:04] part of god's program but if you keep
[1:03:06] looking on what he told us to look at
[1:03:09] look on this look into the law of
[1:03:11] liberty
[1:03:12] right then you won't wander off and you
[1:03:15] won't just go off in people's opinions
[1:03:16] and ideas and what's
[1:03:18] pulling everyone around so we need to be
[1:03:21] lord train us
[1:03:23] to hear the trumpet amen amen so
[1:03:27] just like a natural army we need to know
[1:03:29] what the sound of the trumpet means is
[1:03:30] it to charge to retreat hold the line to
[1:03:32] march make camp break up camp
[1:03:34] you know what does it mean but we also
[1:03:38] have to have confidence
[1:03:39] in the general that gives the
[1:03:41] instructions to the trumpeters to blow
[1:03:43] the
[1:03:43] instruction right if you had no
[1:03:45] confidence in your general how are you
[1:03:47] going to fight in the army
[1:03:48] because you wouldn't trust his decisions
[1:03:50] you wouldn't trust his tactics
[1:03:51] you think this guy doesn't know what
[1:03:53] he's talking about and we're all going
[1:03:55] to get massacred
[1:03:57] right you have to have confidence
[1:03:58] remember because you because the front
[1:04:00] line troops they barely ever saw
[1:04:02] the general they were their captains
[1:04:04] their corporals whatever they didn't see
[1:04:06] the fire you know
[1:04:06] you're the four-star general in charge
[1:04:08] of the campaign quite often
[1:04:10] but the orders came from headquarters
[1:04:11] now this is what we've got to do
[1:04:14] so we have to have confidence in the
[1:04:16] general
[1:04:18] that gives the orders now brother rahm
[1:04:21] says in the greatest battle ever thought
[1:04:22] the brains of the army lays in its
[1:04:24] captains the intelligence
[1:04:26] romulan germany was the brains of
[1:04:27] germany not hitler rommel that's right
[1:04:30] eisenhower military men patton those men
[1:04:32] who were at the front
[1:04:34] it depends on which way they gave the
[1:04:36] order if you fought
[1:04:37] you follow your captain if he's the
[1:04:39] right kind of a general if he's a right
[1:04:41] kind if he's a four-star general if he's
[1:04:43] proved
[1:04:44] if he's been proved to be right follow
[1:04:46] him though it may seem wrong to you
[1:04:48] go on to the front do as he told you
[1:04:51] hallelujah we got a five-star general
[1:04:54] spell j-e-s-u-s placing five stars on us
[1:04:58] f-a-i-t-h he never lost a battle
[1:05:01] hallelujah he conquered death hell in
[1:05:03] the grave get the devils out of the way
[1:05:05] he's the great chief captain so the
[1:05:07] devil isn't even in the picture
[1:05:09] remember our general's been this is not
[1:05:11] his first rodeo
[1:05:13] this is not his first campaign he didn't
[1:05:15] just
[1:05:16] walk out of military school and here i
[1:05:18] am a general no no he's been fighting a
[1:05:20] long time the first campaign he fought
[1:05:22] was in heaven against satan and his
[1:05:24] angels
[1:05:25] amen anyone hallelujah then he came down
[1:05:28] to the earth he pursued his enemy down
[1:05:30] here
[1:05:31] amen and then he told he told moses go
[1:05:34] down into egypt another campaign now
[1:05:36] get them out i've heard the cry of my
[1:05:38] people i've come down and i'm sending
[1:05:40] you to do the job
[1:05:41] and we know the result of that devil
[1:05:43] zero hallelujah
[1:05:45] got two amen he won again it was a
[1:05:48] decisive victory
[1:05:50] amen hallelujah now now now it's time to
[1:05:53] take the land here's another campaign
[1:05:55] they came out now they've got to go in
[1:05:57] amen josh was wondering what to do that
[1:05:59] same general came down said
[1:06:00] joshua i i defeated satan in heaven
[1:06:05] you've come out you've seen me bring you
[1:06:07] out of egypt
[1:06:08] now i'm going to take you into the land
[1:06:10] amen and joshua said
[1:06:12] hallelujah you know what you're doing i
[1:06:14] mean you give a certain sound and they
[1:06:16] took the land
[1:06:17] that's right hallelujah won that
[1:06:19] campaign
[1:06:20] hallelujah amen i mean many times in the
[1:06:23] times of judges israel's back was
[1:06:25] against the wall
[1:06:27] i mean but but the five-star general
[1:06:29] came back down again
[1:06:30] because it's amazing how quickly people
[1:06:31] forget their orders
[1:06:33] it's incredible how you know one
[1:06:35] generation revival then they call off
[1:06:37] they get cold and
[1:06:38] a little bit formal they get comfortable
[1:06:40] the enemy comes in then there's another
[1:06:42] deliverance happens and
[1:06:43] it's amazing how that just happens and
[1:06:46] the cycle of revival and death
[1:06:48] never ends oh but we're in the bright
[1:06:51] age brother ben
[1:06:52] no that may be so but that cycle of
[1:06:55] revival and death can
[1:06:56] still happen but there'll be a people
[1:06:59] upon the earth individuals
[1:07:01] right that will actually god in them
[1:07:03] will break that cycle of revival and
[1:07:05] death
[1:07:06] they won't just have a glorious camp and
[1:07:08] then cool off no they'll stay on fire
[1:07:10] irrespective of the enemy what he does
[1:07:13] what he says is most
[1:07:14] they will stay they will break that
[1:07:16] cycle and i'm so glad
[1:07:18] if you read through the book of judges
[1:07:20] every time there was that recycle of
[1:07:22] revival and death
[1:07:23] israel just called out and many times
[1:07:25] god's just waiting for us to call out to
[1:07:26] him
[1:07:27] oh god remember when you yo well i was
[1:07:30] dancing on the hallelujah highway
[1:07:31] everything seemed fine i was
[1:07:33] everything was glorious in my soul
[1:07:35] restore me back to that
[1:07:36] amen amen and he does
[1:07:40] and he does i mean so so so he went to
[1:07:44] gideon
[1:07:45] the five-star general gave some orders
[1:07:47] they won
[1:07:48] amen hallelujah king david comes to the
[1:07:51] throne
[1:07:52] they took the whole land amen hey man
[1:07:55] you guys
[1:07:55] yo our god's been in the battle for a
[1:07:57] long time
[1:07:58] and he's never lost one amen hallelujah
[1:08:03] he conquered hell death in the grave he
[1:08:05] says boys i'm going to show you how to
[1:08:06] do it
[1:08:07] hallelujah i'm not just going to be you
[1:08:09] know i'm going to come myself
[1:08:11] amen hallelujah hallelujah he never lost
[1:08:14] the battle and he has not lost the
[1:08:16] battle yeah it's amazing
[1:08:17] the devil said i'm going to get your
[1:08:19] seed god i'm going to get your sons and
[1:08:22] daughters i'm going to bring them to
[1:08:23] hell
[1:08:24] and god said no you won't that's right
[1:08:27] and for i know how many thousands of
[1:08:29] years god's still saying
[1:08:30] you haven't and you won't hallelujah you
[1:08:33] won't get one of mine
[1:08:35] hallelujah that's what god said to the
[1:08:37] yeah that's what he said to the devil
[1:08:39] you're not getting one of mine
[1:08:41] not a single one and we can look through
[1:08:43] history and say
[1:08:44] he didn't get that one he didn't get
[1:08:46] that one he didn't get that one
[1:08:49] he didn't get hurt didn't get him didn't
[1:08:50] get this one didn't get this one
[1:08:52] and here we are in 2020 we and god still
[1:08:54] the same saying
[1:08:55] satan you ain't going to get one not a
[1:08:58] single one
[1:09:00] hallelujah because he can't lose a part
[1:09:02] of himself that's why he never lost a
[1:09:04] battle
[1:09:05] he said the war's raging looks like
[1:09:07] we're going to lose
[1:09:09] hold on just like brother cadre preached
[1:09:11] here many years ago
[1:09:12] to be continued we're going to continue
[1:09:15] hold on this is not the last page of the
[1:09:16] book
[1:09:17] this is not the final chapter in the
[1:09:18] episode maybe there's some suspense
[1:09:20] building
[1:09:22] you know when you used to sit in front
[1:09:23] of a tv brain dead and watch some kind
[1:09:25] of drama
[1:09:26] and come to the climax of it it seems to
[1:09:28] be continued
[1:09:30] what's going to happen you know there's
[1:09:32] suspense builds maybe some suspense is
[1:09:34] just building in your life
[1:09:36] hallelujah but that's when god loves to
[1:09:38] come upon the scene
[1:09:39] amen when shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:09:41] they said to the king
[1:09:44] we're not going to bow either he'll save
[1:09:47] us either
[1:09:48] he won't but we're not bowing to your
[1:09:49] image and you say
[1:09:51] to be continues what's going to happen
[1:09:55] because they made up their mind i'm
[1:09:56] sorry i'm not bowing to this thing
[1:09:58] this thing you've crafted with your mind
[1:10:00] this thing you've made hallelujah i'm
[1:10:02] not bowing to this image
[1:10:04] and there's and then the suspense just
[1:10:06] built and all the while god's watching
[1:10:07] down from heaven and yeah brother brown
[1:10:09] dramatized it he tells michael and
[1:10:11] wormwood you can't go down there and
[1:10:12] even though you could if i let you but
[1:10:14] i'm going myself and
[1:10:16] just as they were about to step into the
[1:10:17] furnace the son of man stepped into the
[1:10:19] furnace with them they had a jubilee
[1:10:21] meeting there hallelujah
[1:10:23] hey man sometimes that there's that
[1:10:25] suspense
[1:10:27] just be steady just be steady walk with
[1:10:30] god
[1:10:31] harley walk with him remember he never
[1:10:32] lost the battle amen amen he's always on
[1:10:35] time his timing
[1:10:37] as brother you're a singing member
[1:10:39] patience
[1:10:41] hallelujah amen he knows what he's doing
[1:10:45] but if we're on the front line in the
[1:10:47] roman army julius caesar knew what he
[1:10:49] was doing
[1:10:50] he knew what he was doing but if we were
[1:10:53] little you know whatever legion were on
[1:10:54] the front row just whatever
[1:10:56] if we if we just decided mate this guy
[1:10:58] has no idea
[1:11:00] they're outnumbered many times the
[1:11:01] romans were but he knew what he was
[1:11:03] doing but they had confidence in their
[1:11:04] general
[1:11:05] if they could have confidence in the in
[1:11:07] a natural general
[1:11:09] you know how much more supernatural
[1:11:10] gender how much of god that knows the
[1:11:12] future
[1:11:13] doesn't just predict it because he knows
[1:11:14] human nature and what the enemy will do
[1:11:16] he knows what the enemy will do
[1:11:18] he knows his next movie knows what he's
[1:11:20] thinking he knows what he thinks he can
[1:11:22] do
[1:11:22] hallelujah amen so the
[1:11:26] trumpet this gospel trumpet today is
[1:11:29] such a certain sound
[1:11:31] this message is not an uncertain sound
[1:11:33] it's not a confusing sound it brings
[1:11:36] clarity
[1:11:37] i mean it brings a real stability i mean
[1:11:40] we know
[1:11:40] we know that they you know you know that
[1:11:42] the marching orders of the army
[1:11:44] are not man's opinion because if you
[1:11:47] think about it if the general you know
[1:11:48] the general says let's make camp here
[1:11:51] and we look around and say i don't think
[1:11:53] this is a good place my opinion it
[1:11:55] should be there
[1:11:56] and then he goes away with bill camp
[1:11:58] there he'd get mad
[1:12:00] he said i want camp right here now we
[1:12:03] don't have to necessarily understand why
[1:12:04] camp should be built here he has his
[1:12:06] reasoning
[1:12:07] maybe there's more water maybe he's a
[1:12:08] better defensive position you know it's
[1:12:10] the same thing with the word well
[1:12:12] you know some things you just got to
[1:12:14] take it by faith take him at his word
[1:12:15] remember this whole bible is not man's
[1:12:17] idea you know
[1:12:19] faith you're the faith of the fathers
[1:12:21] what was it
[1:12:22] the bible's always right god's word is
[1:12:25] always right
[1:12:26] it doesn't matter how we feel what we're
[1:12:28] going through our opinion whatever else
[1:12:30] things there's got to be a faith
[1:12:31] restored to the bride
[1:12:33] that god's word is always right
[1:12:36] hallelujah and i believe that's been
[1:12:39] restored
[1:12:39] how are we doing today everyone how's
[1:12:41] everyone good hallelujah
[1:12:43] you know normally the little boys perk
[1:12:44] up talking about swords and fighting and
[1:12:46] you know but yeah it's all good for us
[1:12:49] all anyway
[1:12:51] amen so we have to have confidence
[1:12:55] that our general knows what he's doing
[1:12:56] and he sure does know what he's doing
[1:12:59] hallelujah this gospel trumpet this
[1:13:01] message trumpet
[1:13:02] is a certain sound it is no longer man's
[1:13:05] opinions
[1:13:07] it is thus saith the lord amen
[1:13:10] thus saith the scripture now the sound
[1:13:13] of it going here
[1:13:15] as i yeah i think i touched on it last
[1:13:17] sunday but
[1:13:18] it signifies also it's an awakening to a
[1:13:21] position
[1:13:23] david when he heard that sound remember
[1:13:25] he knew it could be done he'd seen god
[1:13:27] do a lot of things
[1:13:28] but then here was a season now where he
[1:13:30] was going to defeat his enemy
[1:13:32] and you know you know in this particular
[1:13:34] battle
[1:13:36] but but that sounds signified you're
[1:13:38] going to win this battle
[1:13:39] so you're not defeated but you are the
[1:13:41] victor that's why we read that psalm
[1:13:43] sing with the voice of triumph
[1:13:45] i mean praise god with the voice of
[1:13:47] triumph not with defeat
[1:13:48] not with is it going to happen you know
[1:13:50] with triumph hallelujah
[1:13:51] that means a victory has been won amen
[1:13:55] so
[1:13:56] so the sound of it going it actually
[1:14:01] in this day begins to reveal to a people
[1:14:04] their position in christ
[1:14:06] you think how incredible that this
[1:14:07] message is where where
[1:14:09] where god is so come down and shown us
[1:14:11] who the bride is
[1:14:13] right we're you know we're not just
[1:14:14] church members we're not just part of a
[1:14:16] club
[1:14:17] this is not a club there's no joining
[1:14:19] fee there's no
[1:14:20] membership there's no put your name on a
[1:14:22] book this is not a club
[1:14:24] this is not a place we gather because we
[1:14:26] just like each other this is not a good
[1:14:29] yeah i mean i mean i mean this is not a
[1:14:30] place we gather just because the food is
[1:14:32] good
[1:14:33] no it is right amen it's not a place we
[1:14:36] gather just because we get along
[1:14:38] this is not what this is about this is
[1:14:41] about god has revealed himself on this
[1:14:43] day
[1:14:43] and he's gathered a people to himself i
[1:14:46] mean to become one with him
[1:14:48] that is why we have gathered i mean this
[1:14:49] is why we've come under the shadow of
[1:14:51] his wings hallelujah in this place
[1:14:53] not because we get along hallelujah
[1:14:57] but because he's called us
[1:15:00] amen and there's a reason he has called
[1:15:02] us is because he wants us to recognize
[1:15:04] who we are
[1:15:06] amen so so this so the sound of a going
[1:15:09] this message
[1:15:10] is it has released a power into the
[1:15:12] church in the end time
[1:15:14] that we begin to see and understand by
[1:15:16] revelation
[1:15:17] i mean that we are sons and daughters of
[1:15:19] god it's an actually incredible thing
[1:15:21] when you realize
[1:15:23] when god tells you i'm your father
[1:15:26] i mean i'm your father i'm not just
[1:15:28] someone else's father i'm your father
[1:15:31] amen your show your natural parents i
[1:15:33] allow them to bring you here but i am
[1:15:35] your true father
[1:15:36] amen because you realize remember he
[1:15:38] cannot lose remember a child is a part
[1:15:41] of the parent
[1:15:42] and god can't lose a part of himself
[1:15:45] hallelujah amen so we begin to see by
[1:15:49] revelation that we are sons and
[1:15:50] daughters of god
[1:15:51] and that's why the scripture tells us uh
[1:15:54] paul would say in galatians because you
[1:15:55] are sons
[1:15:57] you receive the holy ghost i'm just
[1:15:59] paraphrasing a little bit but it says
[1:16:01] you don't become children when you
[1:16:02] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:04] the reason you receive it is because you
[1:16:06] are because you are you don't become you
[1:16:09] are
[1:16:09] amen hallelujah i mean because you are
[1:16:13] sons go read the book of galatians
[1:16:14] you know he's trying to get all the
[1:16:15] legalism out of that galatian church
[1:16:17] that came in
[1:16:18] it's not because you've earned it and
[1:16:19] it's your human effort that has done it
[1:16:21] it's actually because you are sons he's
[1:16:23] gathered you because you
[1:16:25] are not you don't become you are but you
[1:16:26] need to recognize you are
[1:16:28] i mean not all one day i will no you are
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:31] and if you're a son or a daughter then
[1:16:33] you have rights i mean you have more
[1:16:34] rights than anyone else
[1:16:36] hallelujah and those rights you've got
[1:16:38] to exercise those rights
[1:16:40] hallelujah and it is time remember this
[1:16:44] age is the age of people's rights
[1:16:46] lady hosea writes to the people and
[1:16:48] every group under heaven is rising up
[1:16:50] saying this is our god-given rights
[1:16:53] what about the bride of christ
[1:16:56] remember because that's just in the
[1:16:57] negative what about in the positive
[1:16:59] what about now there should be a people
[1:17:00] on their feet and i believe they are
[1:17:02] saying this is my god-given rights
[1:17:04] this is my identity this is what i this
[1:17:07] is where i belong and i
[1:17:09] want my rights amen we shall write the
[1:17:12] protest against the devil
[1:17:14] satan give it back satan get off my
[1:17:17] ground this is my
[1:17:18] this is my ground this is my ancestors
[1:17:20] ground get off it
[1:17:22] you've been squatting too long
[1:17:24] hallelujah and we have rights remember
[1:17:26] it's not just us as you're pushing for
[1:17:28] something no
[1:17:28] heavens behind us pushing how are you
[1:17:31] going to realize if you're part of an
[1:17:33] army you're not by yourself
[1:17:34] i mean we're not by ourself in this war
[1:17:36] halloween there's more than just
[1:17:38] us in this war i mean angels have
[1:17:40] gathered
[1:17:41] you're amazing it would have been to be
[1:17:42] gehazi or whatever the servant of the
[1:17:44] prophet was
[1:17:45] walk out there there's syrians around
[1:17:47] the place he's panicking
[1:17:48] you know he knocks on the prophet's door
[1:17:50] get up quickly
[1:17:52] we're in trouble maybe the prophet just
[1:17:54] go yo elisha or your wife desire says
[1:17:57] i told you to put the milk bottles out
[1:17:58] at the front door what's going on
[1:18:00] you know brother brown says he
[1:18:02] dramatizes you know because people used
[1:18:03] to put milk bottles out by the front
[1:18:04] door
[1:18:05] once upon a time and you know what's
[1:18:07] wrong and maybe he stretches
[1:18:09] and you know the other servant's
[1:18:10] panicking we're surrounded
[1:18:13] we're going to die they're going to take
[1:18:14] this place look at that come look and
[1:18:15] drag them out of bed and maybe
[1:18:17] you know in the prophet don't worry
[1:18:18] about that amen don't worry about that
[1:18:21] what do you mean don't worry what do you
[1:18:22] mean don't worry can't you see the
[1:18:24] obstacles can you see their shields in
[1:18:26] their swords and their
[1:18:27] and their siege equipment and their army
[1:18:29] and you know we're toast
[1:18:30] don't worry about that and he just prays
[1:18:33] lord open his eyes
[1:18:35] open his eyes hallelujah remember the
[1:18:39] prayer didn't bring the armies of heaven
[1:18:40] down they were already there
[1:18:42] they were there before they woke up they
[1:18:44] were there before the assyrians turned
[1:18:46] up
[1:18:46] hallelujah and then the servant was more
[1:18:48] shocked by the armies of heaven than a
[1:18:50] natural enemy
[1:18:52] but but but he had to realize hey this
[1:18:54] army of heaven hasn't come to get me
[1:18:55] it's come to get them
[1:18:57] it's come to protect me hallelujah it's
[1:18:59] the same thing with you and i friends
[1:19:01] yeah we're not alone in this walk
[1:19:03] we're not alone in this walk you know
[1:19:04] the scripture tells us that the angel of
[1:19:06] the lord and camps about those who fear
[1:19:08] him
[1:19:08] and delivers them now many people will
[1:19:10] just take that as the angels of the lord
[1:19:12] but the scripture is the
[1:19:14] angel of the lord so if god himself
[1:19:17] encamps around his bride
[1:19:20] he himself said whole where's she gone
[1:19:22] i'm going with
[1:19:24] hallelujah i won't leave you i will
[1:19:26] never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:19:28] i'm gonna make my encampment around them
[1:19:31] hallelujah
[1:19:32] and we go through our day and think well
[1:19:34] we're just fighting this battle
[1:19:35] ourselves
[1:19:36] no no heavens here it's more than a
[1:19:38] natural fight more than a natural
[1:19:40] argument to try and
[1:19:41] turn a person's heart to the lord no god
[1:19:43] can do it amen
[1:19:44] hallelujah amen
[1:19:48] the scripture would tell us in romans 8
[1:19:49] that nature itself is travailing
[1:19:52] until there be the manifestation of the
[1:19:54] sons of god it says enough children then
[1:19:56] heirs ears of god joint is with christ
[1:19:58] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:20:00] that we may be also glorified together
[1:20:03] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:20:05] present time
[1:20:06] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:20:08] glory that shall be revealed in us
[1:20:11] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:20:13] creature then
[1:20:14] that word means creation waiteth for the
[1:20:16] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:20:19] nature is groaning nature is groaning
[1:20:22] for for a people to be revealed
[1:20:25] hallelujah for the creature was made
[1:20:28] subject to vanity the creation was made
[1:20:30] subject to vanity not willingly
[1:20:32] but by reason of whom who has subjected
[1:20:34] the same in hope
[1:20:36] because the creature itself also shall
[1:20:39] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:20:41] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:20:43] the children of god
[1:20:44] for we know that the whole creation
[1:20:46] groaneth and travail them pained
[1:20:48] together until now
[1:20:50] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:20:52] which have the first fruits of the
[1:20:53] spirit
[1:20:54] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:20:57] waiting for the adoption
[1:20:58] to wit the redemption of our body who
[1:21:01] gets that kind of groaning that longing
[1:21:03] i'm so homesick and blue i want to see
[1:21:05] jesus i just want to hear those silver
[1:21:07] bells
[1:21:08] chime or let me look past the curtain of
[1:21:10] time you're there
[1:21:11] why is that because god put something in
[1:21:12] us to groan
[1:21:14] and nature is groaning you know if
[1:21:16] nature could preach yourself imagine if
[1:21:18] the earth could preach a sermon right
[1:21:19] now
[1:21:20] imagine if it could what would it be it
[1:21:22] would be addressing you
[1:21:24] it'd be saying come to your position
[1:21:26] we're under this we're under this
[1:21:28] bondage
[1:21:29] of corruption until you come to your
[1:21:31] place
[1:21:33] we want to be free people want to see
[1:21:34] the earth you know we want to be
[1:21:36] predator free by 2050 whatever it is you
[1:21:39] know
[1:21:39] we'll be really predator free day
[1:21:42] right why when when when creation has
[1:21:45] been i've
[1:21:45] come under the glorious liberty of our
[1:21:47] lord jesus i mean by
[1:21:49] by the manifestation of the sons and
[1:21:51] daughters of god hey
[1:21:52] i have a trap in my garden i haven't got
[1:21:54] a rat yet but i want to get one
[1:21:56] right i actually have one there maybe
[1:21:59] i'll trap a rat here trap a devil
[1:22:02] amen so you know i'm not against those
[1:22:04] kind of things because i have a trap
[1:22:05] myself
[1:22:06] i was excited when it turned up but
[1:22:07] anyway we'll get him one day we'll get
[1:22:10] that rat hallelujah you know but but you
[1:22:13] know you really wanted
[1:22:14] to be predator free wait for a
[1:22:16] millennium wait for a new heavens and a
[1:22:17] new earth
[1:22:18] but the only way those things can happen
[1:22:20] is when us when we
[1:22:21] lay aside our humanity and our feelings
[1:22:24] so for ourselves and what we perceive as
[1:22:26] our troubles
[1:22:26] and we just walk with god and just enjoy
[1:22:29] his word and just worship him and love
[1:22:31] him and just
[1:22:31] doesn't matter what's going on in life
[1:22:33] i'm under a heavy load
[1:22:35] but the glory that shall be revealed in
[1:22:37] thee
[1:22:38] how there is nothing compared to the
[1:22:40] problems of this present age
[1:22:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:46] i'm going through a bad year hold on
[1:22:49] eternity is going to be awesome
[1:22:52] i mean it's going to be real awesome
[1:22:54] we're not going to get bored
[1:22:55] up there you know sometimes we think
[1:22:57] what are we going to do
[1:22:59] it's going to be awesome it's going to
[1:23:01] be far greater than what we can think
[1:23:04] and the novelty i don't believe is going
[1:23:06] to wear off
[1:23:07] we're not going to look for anything
[1:23:08] else to do it's going to be awesome
[1:23:11] hallelujah amen
[1:23:14] now as i said the five-star general came
[1:23:16] down and called israel out of egypt
[1:23:19] and then and then on mount sinai
[1:23:22] god would give them a word and he would
[1:23:25] by the sacrifice of blood of bulls and
[1:23:27] goats
[1:23:27] he it says he enjoined that word with
[1:23:30] the people
[1:23:31] he connected them by a sacrifice and he
[1:23:33] was doing this
[1:23:35] because the people had to understand
[1:23:37] that their identity was in that word
[1:23:39] their identity was no longer in the
[1:23:42] scars of their slavehood
[1:23:44] right their identity wasn't they were
[1:23:46] slaves their identity wasn't the word
[1:23:47] that was received
[1:23:49] and and the reason that word was
[1:23:51] received is because
[1:23:52] remember in egypt they were already the
[1:23:54] children of god
[1:23:56] they didn't become the children because
[1:23:58] they went through the red sea they
[1:23:59] already were
[1:24:00] the children of god as as hosea would
[1:24:03] say
[1:24:03] this in in hosea 11 um i'm 11 1
[1:24:07] that when israel was a child then i
[1:24:09] loved him and called my son out of egypt
[1:24:11] now we know that scripture has a
[1:24:12] compound meaning
[1:24:13] you know for one son that was called out
[1:24:15] of egypt was israel but the other the
[1:24:17] greater son was christ himself
[1:24:19] right i mean but but there was a call
[1:24:22] god was calling his sons and daughters
[1:24:24] out of egypt
[1:24:25] because he wanted them to see this is
[1:24:27] not really what you're meant to be
[1:24:29] you're not meant to be a slave under
[1:24:30] these whips of these task masters
[1:24:32] you're not meant to be here in the world
[1:24:34] but i want to call you out
[1:24:35] and give you your inheritance remember
[1:24:38] he has chosen our inheritance for us
[1:24:40] hallelujah amen so there was a call
[1:24:44] he said i'm going to call you out of
[1:24:45] slavery that you're no longer being
[1:24:47] pushed and driven around by those task
[1:24:49] masters
[1:24:50] but you're going to be living in my
[1:24:52] presence and the inheritance that i have
[1:24:53] chosen for you
[1:24:55] in your rightful position which is the
[1:24:56] promised land i mean and we know that is
[1:24:59] what he has done for us
[1:25:01] hallelujah it should make us happy
[1:25:04] i'm no longer a slave to fair i'm a
[1:25:06] child of god i'm no longer
[1:25:08] i mean serving a bottle i'm no longer
[1:25:11] serving computer games i'm no longer
[1:25:12] serving hollywood
[1:25:13] i mean i'm serving god now i'm no longer
[1:25:16] serving the god of sports hey i did
[1:25:18] basically everything
[1:25:20] right but i don't serve it no more
[1:25:23] why because i heard a call amen he saw
[1:25:25] me and said
[1:25:26] son this is not your place you think
[1:25:29] this is your place this is not your
[1:25:30] place come up higher
[1:25:31] come out of that stuff amen hallelujah i
[1:25:34] mean because
[1:25:35] so that's what he did for us he called
[1:25:37] us out of the world he cast the devil
[1:25:39] out of our hearts
[1:25:40] and turned it from unbelief to faith in
[1:25:42] the word of god
[1:25:44] amen as the apostle paul would say in
[1:25:46] first corinthians 6
[1:25:47] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[1:25:49] not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:25:51] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:25:53] idolatrous nor
[1:25:54] adult um idolaters nor effeminate nor
[1:25:58] abusers of themselves of mankind nor
[1:26:00] thieves nor covetous
[1:26:01] nor drunkards nor revelers nor
[1:26:03] extortioners
[1:26:04] shall inherit the kingdom of god and
[1:26:08] such were some of you amen you were so
[1:26:11] paul's saying what i've just listed you
[1:26:12] were some of you were like this
[1:26:14] some of you were actually living out
[1:26:16] what i'm saying right such were some of
[1:26:18] you but ye
[1:26:19] are washed but yes sanctified but yeah
[1:26:22] justified in the name of the lord jesus
[1:26:24] by the spirit of our god
[1:26:26] hallelujah so god came and washed him
[1:26:28] called them took those things out of
[1:26:30] them he says you're that way once
[1:26:31] but now you're not that way anymore i
[1:26:33] mean you've been sanctified you've been
[1:26:35] washed you've been justified hallelujah
[1:26:38] amen hey that gives us you should give
[1:26:40] us something to shout about
[1:26:43] are you just trying to make us happy hey
[1:26:45] we have something to be happy about
[1:26:47] hallelujah we'll be happy now we'll be
[1:26:50] happy as the bodies
[1:26:51] yeah after the body changes we'll be
[1:26:53] happy in the millennium
[1:26:54] we'll be happy in the new heavens and
[1:26:55] the new earth we're just going to be
[1:26:56] happy
[1:26:57] amen why because the lord has called us
[1:26:59] out
[1:27:00] hallelujah hallelujah i mean if we look
[1:27:03] at the parable of the prodigal son
[1:27:05] he came to himself in the pigpen
[1:27:08] he realized his position wasn't meant to
[1:27:11] be in the pig pen hungering after the
[1:27:13] slot that the pigs were eating
[1:27:14] that wasn't his remember he actually he
[1:27:16] was so hungry he came to such a
[1:27:18] desperate place
[1:27:19] that through those scraps he was feeding
[1:27:21] to the pigs he said if only i could eat
[1:27:23] this food
[1:27:25] you know and there
[1:27:28] has to come a time in our lives when we
[1:27:30] have to stop hanging after pig
[1:27:32] slop this world is pig sloth
[1:27:35] oh but it's so lovely and shiny it's pig
[1:27:38] slop
[1:27:39] really all the all the things that devil
[1:27:41] tries to give us it's pig slop
[1:27:43] you know brother brown would tell us now
[1:27:46] i don't know what this value is
[1:27:47] in in in today's um today's money
[1:27:52] but he says some time ago i was standing
[1:27:54] in a colosseum
[1:27:55] and i was looking at and and watching
[1:27:57] around looking at
[1:27:58] art and displays i've seen the analysis
[1:28:01] of a human body
[1:28:02] and there was two young men standing
[1:28:04] looking at this and it said
[1:28:06] that a man that weighed 150 pounds
[1:28:09] he was worth 84 cents in chemicals
[1:28:13] so if you take your body you take all
[1:28:15] the chemicals out of it all the hydrogen
[1:28:17] and you know and the carbon and the iron
[1:28:20] and the zinc and you know all the
[1:28:22] different elements that make up a human
[1:28:23] body the nitrogen all those things
[1:28:25] if you took that down this is in 1960
[1:28:30] the human body is only worth 80 84 cents
[1:28:34] so this guy here this guy 84 cents
[1:28:38] and maybe today five bucks i don't know
[1:28:40] but it's not a lot
[1:28:41] you can't even really go to the dairy
[1:28:43] you know i can't even sell this body of
[1:28:45] chemicals
[1:28:46] and get many well it's not even five
[1:28:48] cent lollies anymore you know i know
[1:28:50] what it is but you know
[1:28:51] i can't get much with the value of this
[1:28:54] guy
[1:28:56] amen he had just about enough whitewash
[1:28:59] on him to sprinkle a hen's nest
[1:29:01] and so much that chemicals was worth 84
[1:29:04] cents
[1:29:04] one of them boys looked and said well
[1:29:06] jim
[1:29:08] we're not worth very much are we i
[1:29:10] thought that's right
[1:29:11] this body's not uh worth very much
[1:29:15] but yet we'll put a ten dollar head on
[1:29:17] top of it now i don't know what that is
[1:29:19] in
[1:29:19] in today's you know you know but we go
[1:29:22] in and get hundred dollars worth of
[1:29:23] clothes and we think we're you know
[1:29:25] fancy fancy and a fifty dollar mink coat
[1:29:28] turn up our nose if it would rain or
[1:29:31] drown us see
[1:29:33] we think we're somebody dressed all up
[1:29:35] and pretty all up and go out and take
[1:29:38] care of that 84 cents you go into a
[1:29:41] restaurant
[1:29:42] and they hand you a bowl of soup that
[1:29:44] had a spider in it
[1:29:45] you'd sue the restaurant you'd complain
[1:29:48] imagine you go to some restaurant and
[1:29:49] there's you know
[1:29:50] flies and you know there's a fly in my
[1:29:52] soup and there's bugs in it and it's
[1:29:54] half
[1:29:54] it's not even cooked right you know
[1:29:56] people complain
[1:29:57] i ask for a medium medium rare steak you
[1:30:00] know this is medium rare you know people
[1:30:02] do that
[1:30:03] they actually complain about those
[1:30:04] little things right
[1:30:06] you're watching see he says you're
[1:30:08] watching this 84 cents
[1:30:10] but you've got a soul in there that's
[1:30:12] worth 10 000 worlds
[1:30:14] and you'll poke anything down it amen
[1:30:17] world lust anything else it's eternal
[1:30:20] and it's worth ten thousand worlds
[1:30:22] but we watch the 84 cents and walk away
[1:30:25] from the value of the 10 000 worlds
[1:30:28] isn't that something people give their
[1:30:31] whole lives
[1:30:33] they have their now nothing against
[1:30:34] fitness nothing is those things but they
[1:30:36] have their fitness program
[1:30:37] and they watch what they eat down to the
[1:30:39] detail and it's got to be organic and
[1:30:41] free range and whatever whatever
[1:30:42] whatever
[1:30:43] you know and it's got to be fed just
[1:30:44] right it's got to be all these things
[1:30:46] and it's just
[1:30:46] watching 84 cents
[1:30:50] but the soul is but yet people will
[1:30:53] watch all kinds of stuff
[1:30:55] and they'll pour basically garbage into
[1:30:57] their spirit into their soul
[1:30:59] they will pour all kinds of vomit are
[1:31:01] you with me
[1:31:02] hey we've got you know where's i don't
[1:31:05] have a pot but if i had a pot i'd put it
[1:31:06] here
[1:31:07] and say let's boil it down you know
[1:31:10] water can look alright
[1:31:14] now this is if i ball this water down
[1:31:16] it's fine
[1:31:17] there wouldn't be anything in it but if
[1:31:19] i took the finest quality stokes valley
[1:31:22] water out of the tap
[1:31:23] that changes flavor after you pour it in
[1:31:25] you know after a while
[1:31:27] you know no honestly because we've got a
[1:31:29] you know with um
[1:31:31] bottles and stuff we've got to sanitize
[1:31:32] the thing you put into the microwave you
[1:31:33] put water in it
[1:31:34] if you don't wash that thing out much
[1:31:37] there's like this brown
[1:31:38] sludge on the bottom of the sanitizer
[1:31:40] and that's not from the dirty bottles
[1:31:42] those have been cleaned it's from the
[1:31:44] water
[1:31:46] you got to boil it down yeah you say
[1:31:48] well do you still drink this stuff
[1:31:50] yes i do anyway you say well that's
[1:31:54] pretty dumb
[1:31:55] hey i need water but we'll take things
[1:31:59] we'll take things that look so wonderful
[1:32:01] that's so pleasant to the
[1:32:02] flesh and if you boil it down it's just
[1:32:06] brown sludge
[1:32:09] and it's 84 cents we're so concerned
[1:32:11] about but spiritually just brown sludge
[1:32:16] but your soul is worth ten thousand
[1:32:17] worlds you know we are very high value
[1:32:20] you should think the devil comes along
[1:32:21] tries to sell you you know some boy or
[1:32:23] some girl or whatever it may be you're
[1:32:25] worth more than that
[1:32:26] i mean you're worth more than that
[1:32:28] hallelujah
[1:32:30] yeah think about it our soul's worth
[1:32:33] ten thousand worlds why don't we look
[1:32:35] after the ten thousand worlds but that's
[1:32:37] right
[1:32:38] amen now the prodigal son would realize
[1:32:42] that pig slop is really not
[1:32:44] it it actually doesn't belong to him
[1:32:46] this is not his rightful position
[1:32:48] he had even his servants in his father's
[1:32:50] house had it better than him where he
[1:32:52] was right there
[1:32:54] i mean so so then he arose he went back
[1:32:56] repentantly back to his father
[1:32:58] he says father i've sinned against you
[1:33:00] and against heaven i'm no word
[1:33:02] i'm no longer worthy enough to be called
[1:33:04] your son that's the problem many people
[1:33:06] come to god that way
[1:33:07] they think they've been too wrong
[1:33:08] they've done too much they're not worthy
[1:33:10] to be a son or daughter of god
[1:33:12] but the father had no interest in a son
[1:33:15] being a servant
[1:33:16] this was never his purpose never his
[1:33:18] motive but when his son came home he
[1:33:20] said son you're going back there's being
[1:33:21] a son
[1:33:22] because you are a son amen you don't
[1:33:24] become a son because you said so and you
[1:33:26] come back you already were a son
[1:33:28] hallelujah so so so the son because of
[1:33:31] what he had done
[1:33:33] thought i cannot be a son no more but
[1:33:35] the father said you're still my son
[1:33:38] my blood flows through your veins you
[1:33:40] look like me now you're starting to act
[1:33:41] like me because you've come to your
[1:33:43] right mind
[1:33:44] hallelujah just like us we're a crazy
[1:33:46] people i mean being under the spirit of
[1:33:48] the devil we were mad that's right
[1:33:50] and i'm saying we because i'm very much
[1:33:52] a part of that week
[1:33:53] the crazy stuff but one day one day god
[1:33:57] came my way
[1:33:58] and i came to and i came to myself
[1:34:00] harlow said lord there must be a place
[1:34:03] and he didn't want to keep me a servant
[1:34:05] he never that was never in his mind no
[1:34:07] you're my son you're going to be
[1:34:08] restored as a son
[1:34:10] as the same thing with you and i friends
[1:34:12] he doesn't want to serve and he doesn't
[1:34:13] want a second-class citizen
[1:34:14] he wants a son and daughter of god
[1:34:16] hallelujah
[1:34:18] and he came back in his rags
[1:34:21] they think about the father the father
[1:34:24] didn't even respond
[1:34:26] at first when when the son says i'm not
[1:34:29] worthy to be called thy son
[1:34:31] but he says to his servants bring forth
[1:34:34] the best robe
[1:34:35] and put it on him put a ring on his hand
[1:34:38] and shoes on his feet now i just want to
[1:34:40] ask you the question
[1:34:41] do you think that his rags that he that
[1:34:43] that you know he was slopping around the
[1:34:45] pig pen and
[1:34:46] they're all dirty and filthy do you
[1:34:47] think he had those on under that best
[1:34:49] rope
[1:34:51] no those would have been taken away so
[1:34:54] god just doesn't rob us in his
[1:34:55] righteousness
[1:34:56] but yet we still feel the old rags
[1:34:58] underneath we still
[1:35:00] feel the sin and the pains of guilt and
[1:35:02] you know all those things you know
[1:35:03] we don't pack that under us hallelujah
[1:35:07] but that's all taken away
[1:35:09] where you've been walking son or
[1:35:11] daughter i don't want you to remember it
[1:35:12] anymore
[1:35:13] i don't want you to feel the guilt of it
[1:35:15] i'm taking your guilt away
[1:35:16] i mean that's what the blood of the
[1:35:18] cross does it takes your guilt away
[1:35:20] hallelujah it takes our regret oh i wish
[1:35:22] i never did it he said no no i've taken
[1:35:25] care of it
[1:35:26] you don't have to walk with that guilt
[1:35:28] or that shame or whatever it is
[1:35:30] you don't need i've taken care of this
[1:35:32] hallelujah
[1:35:33] hallelujah amen and shoes were put on
[1:35:37] his feet he walked a different kind of
[1:35:38] way
[1:35:40] hallelujah walk in bare feet you got to
[1:35:42] be careful where you walk but if you've
[1:35:43] got shoes on you can just walk
[1:35:45] hallelujah ring was put on his hand
[1:35:47] signifying he had authority
[1:35:49] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:35:53] just like brother ram said the blood is
[1:35:54] a bleach
[1:35:56] it's a bleach hallelujah and when that
[1:35:59] drop of sin falls in that blood brother
[1:36:01] says it breaks down then the ink becomes
[1:36:02] bleach now i don't understand how that
[1:36:04] works but
[1:36:04] you just can't find that ink no more
[1:36:07] hallelujah
[1:36:09] his the prodigal son's identity was in
[1:36:12] his family
[1:36:14] was in where his his father said he was
[1:36:16] to be
[1:36:17] not where he had been in the world amen
[1:36:20] so the word
[1:36:21] so the word that was given on sinai
[1:36:24] was the identity of israel when they
[1:36:27] came out of egypt
[1:36:28] it wasn't their slave marks it wasn't
[1:36:31] the you know
[1:36:32] disappointments of the past or whatever
[1:36:34] happened the scars and the damage that
[1:36:36] wasn't their identity
[1:36:37] their identity was in that word
[1:36:41] you know it's been told when when when
[1:36:43] um you know the jews
[1:36:45] pardon me came out of the concentration
[1:36:47] camps in camps in um
[1:36:49] you know europe and so on that many of
[1:36:52] them when they got on the boats they
[1:36:53] went back to the promised land
[1:36:55] some of them still had their prison
[1:36:57] garments on
[1:36:59] but one of the first things they did
[1:37:00] when they left there and they came into
[1:37:02] the promised land
[1:37:04] as they were those robes were those
[1:37:06] those prison girls were taken off
[1:37:09] and they put on new clothes so the
[1:37:12] things that brought them there they were
[1:37:13] taken away
[1:37:15] now they are new people amen they
[1:37:18] weren't just survivors of a
[1:37:19] concentration camp but now they were
[1:37:21] living in their own land
[1:37:23] i mean and we've been called out of this
[1:37:24] concentration camp in the world
[1:37:26] highly but don't carry don't don't wear
[1:37:29] your prison garb
[1:37:30] amen amen god doesn't want us in stripes
[1:37:33] he wants us in the robes of his
[1:37:35] righteousness highly where everyone
[1:37:37] looks the same
[1:37:39] hallelujah
[1:37:43] amen so their identity now that was just
[1:37:45] israel in the natural who follows me
[1:37:47] remember their identity was to be in the
[1:37:48] word
[1:37:49] it wasn't to be but the problem is they
[1:37:51] started to look around to their
[1:37:52] neighbors and try and do what their
[1:37:53] neighbors did
[1:37:55] our identity is in the word of god
[1:37:58] not my friends not my community
[1:38:02] not even my nation though i love this
[1:38:03] nation i love my community love my
[1:38:05] friends
[1:38:05] but my identity is in the word of god
[1:38:08] this is who i am help us lord jesus amen
[1:38:12] amen now in this day
[1:38:17] we know the book has come open and it's
[1:38:19] to bring us
[1:38:21] back that we would realize that we are
[1:38:23] bible christians
[1:38:25] the the seals came open to reveal christ
[1:38:28] it's not doctrine it's a person being
[1:38:30] made known and we realize that our
[1:38:32] identity
[1:38:32] isn't our husband which is the word of
[1:38:34] god amen this is who we are we no longer
[1:38:37] have our own identity
[1:38:38] our identity is his identity hallelujah
[1:38:41] that's incredible when you think about
[1:38:43] how god
[1:38:44] would would come to us in this day
[1:38:47] because remember a trumpet gives a
[1:38:48] certain you know
[1:38:49] a true trumpet gives a certain sound
[1:38:52] and so god would vindicate a trumpet in
[1:38:54] this day
[1:38:55] and he would prove now this is not this
[1:38:57] man's opinion but this is me speaking
[1:38:59] through this man
[1:39:01] hallelujah that's why to me the message
[1:39:03] was over vindicated
[1:39:04] amen remember remember with moses he
[1:39:07] went down to the elder the elders of
[1:39:09] israel and he showed the sign
[1:39:11] and they believed and they worshipped
[1:39:12] that was it that's all that needed to be
[1:39:14] done
[1:39:15] but then it was meeting after meeting
[1:39:17] service after service doesn't matter
[1:39:19] what country it was in
[1:39:20] god came down and revealed the thoughts
[1:39:22] and tense of the hearts
[1:39:23] over and over and over again as a
[1:39:25] scriptural sign a scriptural voice
[1:39:28] so to me it's over vindicated but god
[1:39:30] had to do it in such a way to say
[1:39:32] this is me this is not him this is me
[1:39:35] this is not his idea this is me what's
[1:39:37] happening now that that gospel trumpet
[1:39:39] was giving a
[1:39:40] certain sound because god was saying no
[1:39:42] this is me
[1:39:43] imagine if we're in the army we're in
[1:39:44] the legion and you hear the trumpet
[1:39:46] sound and you know that's the cow
[1:39:47] cavalry charging and you look around and
[1:39:50] they don't come
[1:39:52] someone else comes you think now hold on
[1:39:55] that sound did not produce what it said
[1:39:58] would produce
[1:39:59] because instead of horsemen you've got
[1:40:02] some guys carrying water or something
[1:40:04] you know so so you would not have faith
[1:40:07] in that trumpet
[1:40:08] sound because remember if you're in the
[1:40:09] heat of battle you need reinforcements
[1:40:11] you don't be standing there just you
[1:40:12] know just us here our unit we need
[1:40:14] reinforcements especially the enemy's
[1:40:16] really pressing
[1:40:17] but if you heard that trumpet sound you
[1:40:19] could actually it would actually give
[1:40:20] you courage
[1:40:22] boys the cavalry is on its way holy and
[1:40:24] you hear that trouble
[1:40:25] then you hear the beating of hooves and
[1:40:28] then and then they charge into the
[1:40:29] battle
[1:40:30] and then and then you can win the day so
[1:40:32] that trumpet sound was vindicated by the
[1:40:34] horsemen coming you're following what
[1:40:36] i'm saying well it's the same thing with
[1:40:38] this trumpet that sounded
[1:40:39] i mean if the prophet stood there and
[1:40:41] said now i'm waiting for the angel lord
[1:40:43] and nothing happened
[1:40:45] you'd have to start questioning hold on
[1:40:47] i thought he's declaring he's here but
[1:40:49] where is he
[1:40:51] right and if he said now this message
[1:40:53] takes us back to a true pentecost
[1:40:56] but we never ever go to that pentecost
[1:40:59] well you have to begin to doubt is this
[1:41:00] a certain sound
[1:41:02] but then now when we see when he says
[1:41:04] now he is here
[1:41:05] and i think brother billy paul said he
[1:41:07] didn't even didn't even need to say that
[1:41:09] because such an atmosphere of god coming
[1:41:11] into the place everyone knew he was
[1:41:13] there
[1:41:14] or we could actually say when he says
[1:41:15] we've been restored to a true pentecost
[1:41:18] and we've experienced that pentecost
[1:41:20] who's gone up to the upper room
[1:41:22] who's received a true pentecost god
[1:41:24] indwelling you in his word manifesting
[1:41:26] out of your life
[1:41:27] you can say no that trumpet is certain
[1:41:30] highly so if those things
[1:41:32] have been made true now what he's saying
[1:41:34] about the future
[1:41:36] is has to be right because if the past
[1:41:38] is true
[1:41:39] that that must be true too how do we
[1:41:41] have confidence in the scripture
[1:41:43] there's many things that are not
[1:41:44] fulfilled yet and there's lots of
[1:41:46] debates and all those things about
[1:41:48] but we can say well this part was
[1:41:50] interpreted by bringing it to pass
[1:41:52] god did he'll do that as well that's how
[1:41:55] we can have confidence actually
[1:41:56] we are walking you know people you know
[1:41:58] when brother bran's ministry
[1:42:00] came on the scene people say bible days
[1:42:02] are here again
[1:42:03] we've always been in bible days we are
[1:42:06] still in bible days
[1:42:07] we are walking in the pages of the
[1:42:09] scripture but we need to say lord may i
[1:42:11] see jesus
[1:42:12] and his program lord may i see you and
[1:42:15] your program
[1:42:15] amen so now a prophet would come in this
[1:42:18] day now remember when the
[1:42:19] word comes open in any place it it gives
[1:42:22] people faith
[1:42:24] to manifest or god comes and manifests
[1:42:26] in their life the promise of the age
[1:42:28] so moses you know yo the word came down
[1:42:31] on mount sinai
[1:42:32] it gave people faith to take the land
[1:42:34] and they did right
[1:42:36] caleb and joshua they took the land
[1:42:37] because it gave them faith actually boys
[1:42:39] we're going to receive our inheritance
[1:42:41] jesus came the word came open and people
[1:42:43] went from a spiritual condition to the
[1:42:45] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:47] gave them faith faith cometh by hearing
[1:42:49] and hearing the word of god
[1:42:50] once they're under the prince of the
[1:42:51] power of the year but now they're
[1:42:53] walking in faith they're walking by the
[1:42:54] faith of the son of god
[1:42:56] hallelujah so now it's the same thing
[1:42:58] today this word that has come open in
[1:43:00] this day the books come open it gives us
[1:43:02] a rapturing faith
[1:43:03] it doesn't just give us faith you know
[1:43:05] you know the faith that the
[1:43:07] that the law gave gave them faith to
[1:43:09] take the land
[1:43:10] is everyone following what i'm saying it
[1:43:12] gave them the faith to do it right
[1:43:13] those who did not believe fell in the
[1:43:16] wilderness
[1:43:17] but those that had faith took the land
[1:43:19] yeah i think it's amazing
[1:43:20] that younger generation 20 years and
[1:43:22] down i believe it was
[1:43:24] isn't it incredible that they broke the
[1:43:25] cycle of unbelief
[1:43:27] you think about the homes that they were
[1:43:28] raised in some of them were
[1:43:30] never saw egypt but they were living
[1:43:33] with parents
[1:43:34] that were told you're not going in
[1:43:36] imagine the atmosphere imagine the
[1:43:38] atmosphere that somehow
[1:43:40] they broke through of unbelief and doubt
[1:43:43] when they actually begin to realize
[1:43:45] mom and dad the promise is not yours but
[1:43:46] it's mine and you can't stop me getting
[1:43:49] my promise
[1:43:50] there was an anointing in the camp that
[1:43:53] anointed the younger people now i'm not
[1:43:55] saying those who are 20 and older are
[1:43:56] not going in this is different this is a
[1:43:58] spiritual thing you understand but but
[1:44:00] they
[1:44:00] there was a younger generation there
[1:44:02] that broke the cycle because
[1:44:04] normally what happens you see traits in
[1:44:06] families
[1:44:08] stuff happens bad stuff happens and
[1:44:10] unfortunately the
[1:44:11] the children take on those things so
[1:44:14] bad stuff really happened there when
[1:44:16] they said we're not going in
[1:44:18] you think the children would just adopt
[1:44:20] just take on what their parents have
[1:44:21] taken on and they'd become stiff-necked
[1:44:24] and they'd reject what moses said you
[1:44:27] know and you know and they would not
[1:44:28] believe the promise
[1:44:29] but something happened in the camp where
[1:44:32] they realized
[1:44:33] we're going in you may have to die here
[1:44:36] in the wilderness mom and dad but
[1:44:38] i'm not staying here with you i'm going
[1:44:40] into the promised land because the
[1:44:41] promise is mine
[1:44:43] hallelujah and we're living in the same
[1:44:46] time
[1:44:47] oh lord jesus may we have just such a
[1:44:49] doesn't matter what the previous
[1:44:50] generation has done
[1:44:51] they've done what they've done let them
[1:44:53] do what they've done this is another day
[1:44:55] amen this is another season in the word
[1:44:57] may we go in and take every part of the
[1:44:59] land itself
[1:45:02] you know there used to be a great fear
[1:45:04] remember a trumpet gives a certain sound
[1:45:06] a real trumpet gives a certain sound i
[1:45:09] trust i'm not wearing you out with these
[1:45:11] with these comments but now isn't it
[1:45:13] amazing
[1:45:15] that that the prophet told us
[1:45:20] our position just like moses told the
[1:45:24] people of israel
[1:45:26] certain countries had certain borders
[1:45:28] moab had their place
[1:45:31] uh ammon had their place these ones had
[1:45:33] their place
[1:45:34] and then joshua defined the you know yo
[1:45:36] expanded on that a bit more
[1:45:38] and then now we have a ministry coming
[1:45:39] this time
[1:45:41] and says now okay the world that's their
[1:45:43] inheritance
[1:45:44] the foolish virgin they have their place
[1:45:47] right
[1:45:48] the great she's got her place this
[1:45:51] system's got their place
[1:45:52] but then he begin to define the borders
[1:45:54] or the inheritance of the bride
[1:45:57] and he would tell us in the feast of the
[1:45:59] trumpet speaking of the persecution he
[1:46:01] says the jews have their place you know
[1:46:03] he actually god used him to say this is
[1:46:05] everyone's place
[1:46:07] remember he's chosen us our inheritance
[1:46:09] hallelujah i'm just glad where i fall
[1:46:10] into aren't you
[1:46:12] hallelujah he says on the face of the
[1:46:14] trumpets now
[1:46:16] he says now talking about a a
[1:46:18] persecution that's here
[1:46:21] he says not upon denominations but upon
[1:46:23] the bride but here you'll get it the
[1:46:25] bride does not go through that time so
[1:46:27] speaking of the great tribulation you
[1:46:29] know many people thought that they would
[1:46:32] but the bible says not the church will
[1:46:34] but not the bride can't you see
[1:46:36] ministers can't you see that brethren
[1:46:38] you say well the church has to go
[1:46:40] through the persecution for the
[1:46:41] perfection of it you know many people
[1:46:43] believe that
[1:46:44] people still did but people did back
[1:46:46] then and they still do they think the
[1:46:47] church and the bride is just one lump
[1:46:49] and they all have to go through a
[1:46:50] tribulation
[1:46:52] but we had a certain sound in this day
[1:46:55] declaring to us and saying the church
[1:46:58] has to go through that because people
[1:47:00] say well
[1:47:00] people have to go the church has to go
[1:47:02] into the tribulation for its perfection
[1:47:05] but he says the blood of jesus christ
[1:47:06] perfects the bride
[1:47:08] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:47:11] through a lot of punishment
[1:47:13] he's already found grace too with her
[1:47:16] she has found grace with him he engages
[1:47:19] to her
[1:47:20] and if there is anything but me he'll
[1:47:23] keep her
[1:47:23] from every place to turn her hand his
[1:47:26] grace
[1:47:27] is so great upon them and so will it be
[1:47:30] upon the bride and so it
[1:47:31] is on the bride we are worthy creatures
[1:47:34] deserving of hell but his grace holds us
[1:47:37] through it
[1:47:38] look how many lost and blind how many
[1:47:40] how many sinners was there in the world
[1:47:42] the hour i got saved
[1:47:44] have you thought about that amen god
[1:47:47] save me for a purpose and i'm determined
[1:47:49] by his will to
[1:47:50] do that purpose i don't care what
[1:47:52] anything
[1:47:53] else goes i want to do it so he so says
[1:47:56] that his grace
[1:47:57] is so great upon them and it will be
[1:48:00] upon the bride and so
[1:48:02] it is on the bride the other kind of
[1:48:04] grace we live under is incredible
[1:48:06] his grace is amazing you may think well
[1:48:08] it's not that amazing but when it
[1:48:10] strikes you you'll find it be amazing
[1:48:12] hallelujah so his grace is so great upon
[1:48:15] us
[1:48:15] that the bride cannot go through the
[1:48:17] tribulation he will keep her from that
[1:48:19] hour amen when the darkness of ours
[1:48:21] comes then jesus comes
[1:48:23] i meant to catch his bride away
[1:48:26] hallelujah he would say in the invisible
[1:48:27] you
[1:48:28] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:48:29] christ hallelujah now notice we're not
[1:48:32] only that but we're going to the wedding
[1:48:34] in the sky
[1:48:35] and you are wearing the wedding band of
[1:48:38] predestinated
[1:48:39] unmerited grace a wedding band of grace
[1:48:42] and merited of your own
[1:48:44] god did it himself he knew you before
[1:48:46] the foundation of the world
[1:48:48] so he slipped the wedding band on you
[1:48:51] there hallelujah you say where's the
[1:48:54] where's the engagement ring you were
[1:48:56] born with it amen
[1:48:58] it was on your he says he slipped it on
[1:49:00] your finger before the foundation of the
[1:49:02] world
[1:49:02] hallelujah there put your name on a book
[1:49:05] what a thanksgiving hallelujah praise
[1:49:08] our god
[1:49:09] you know that takes a lot of stress away
[1:49:12] that takes a lot of uncertainty away
[1:49:14] hallelujah you think about the grace
[1:49:16] that god is guys you know this is your
[1:49:17] inheritance
[1:49:18] you're not the tribulation is not yours
[1:49:21] we're going to look at what's not ours
[1:49:23] the tribulation is not ours trouble is
[1:49:25] in ours
[1:49:26] fear is not ours hey the devil might try
[1:49:28] and put it on us but
[1:49:29] fear is not ours sickness is doesn't
[1:49:32] belong to us
[1:49:33] yes holy worry doesn't belong to us
[1:49:36] we're gonna look at what doesn't belong
[1:49:37] to us
[1:49:38] yes hallelujah
[1:49:41] amen he says in the unconditional
[1:49:45] covenant that god made with his people
[1:49:47] speaking about abraham now then down out
[1:49:50] of babylon
[1:49:51] down down into china when abraham's
[1:49:54] father and
[1:49:54] abram he was abram first then he had
[1:49:56] taken with him
[1:49:58] sarah his his wife lot the nephew and
[1:50:01] while down
[1:50:02] china there perhaps lived a peaceful
[1:50:03] life probably out probably in the
[1:50:05] morning picked berries and
[1:50:06] ate them and went into the bush and
[1:50:08] killed his protein for food and then at
[1:50:10] night eat some more berries peacefully
[1:50:12] then one day
[1:50:13] abraham no more than any other man maybe
[1:50:15] as far as we know
[1:50:16] coming out of babylon perhaps an
[1:50:18] idolater but god by election god does
[1:50:21] the choosing we
[1:50:22] can't choose god does the choosing we
[1:50:24] have nothing to do with it
[1:50:26] man said oh brother i sought god i
[1:50:28] sought no man ever sought god
[1:50:30] it's not in a man to seek god no man at
[1:50:33] any time or any age sort god
[1:50:34] it's just vice versa it's god seeking
[1:50:37] the man
[1:50:38] not man seeking god jesus says no man
[1:50:40] can come to me except my father draws
[1:50:42] him right
[1:50:42] so here he comes now here's his here's
[1:50:44] abraham now
[1:50:46] he's called by god he comes out of
[1:50:48] babylon
[1:50:49] and then he and he's taken into the
[1:50:51] promised land so now he has received the
[1:50:54] power
[1:50:55] aiming to take back what the enemy is
[1:50:57] taking from him because he's now in
[1:50:58] in his inheritance amen now abraham we
[1:51:01] know he was just a farmer he wasn't a
[1:51:03] soldier he didn't have a trained army
[1:51:05] but when the kings and stuff were
[1:51:06] fighting and lot and his family were
[1:51:08] taken captive
[1:51:09] then he armed his trained servants i
[1:51:11] mean and he went and got back
[1:51:13] everything that the devil stole the
[1:51:14] enemy stole from him right
[1:51:16] but you see they were not soldiers they
[1:51:18] were just servants that were armed but
[1:51:20] the reason is the reason he could do it
[1:51:21] is because he was living in his
[1:51:23] inheritance
[1:51:24] i mean so many times we just have to
[1:51:26] fight with what we got
[1:51:28] that's right i remember it's not really
[1:51:30] ultimately it's not your size in the
[1:51:31] battle that matters
[1:51:33] it's god's size in the battle that
[1:51:35] matters hallelujah david will be
[1:51:37] anointed king i'm just going to skip
[1:51:39] through this
[1:51:40] maybe quickly but you know david
[1:51:44] david would be anointed king he was from
[1:51:47] judah
[1:51:48] the philistines would invade and that
[1:51:51] invade into judah
[1:51:52] so now they're coming into a son of
[1:51:54] god's inheritance
[1:51:56] so of course goliath's got to die you
[1:51:58] know when the devil comes on your ground
[1:52:00] he's got to lose i mean he's got to back
[1:52:04] off he's got to back down he's got to
[1:52:05] get out
[1:52:06] why because he's come on your
[1:52:07] inheritance just like abraham could get
[1:52:09] locked back because
[1:52:10] the devil came onto his ground and that
[1:52:12] was part of his possession
[1:52:15] though lot wasn't called like abraham
[1:52:16] was he could go get him back
[1:52:19] hallelujah so david was just a shepherd
[1:52:21] boy
[1:52:22] yeah it's amazing i was just thinking
[1:52:24] about yo god lays things in the
[1:52:26] scripture
[1:52:27] for a certain generation maybe if it was
[1:52:30] spoken maybe thousands of years ago
[1:52:32] but it's for and and and it can be a
[1:52:34] blessing and a strength for all
[1:52:35] believers down through
[1:52:37] but there's a certain people that will
[1:52:38] actually take that scripture and we'll
[1:52:40] and it
[1:52:40] will fully manifest you know i was
[1:52:42] thinking about that brook that david
[1:52:44] would would would walk across after he
[1:52:46] had spoken to saul and
[1:52:48] you know and and david would testify to
[1:52:50] saul how he killed the lion and killed
[1:52:51] the bear and goliath is just like them
[1:52:52] he's going to die too
[1:52:54] you know and and and saul was impressed
[1:52:57] by his courage and something and saul
[1:52:58] said well you're going to be our
[1:52:59] champion
[1:53:00] and he tried to put his armor on him and
[1:53:02] it didn't fit his you know fit him
[1:53:04] because an ecclesiastical
[1:53:05] intellectual vest armor doesn't doesn't
[1:53:07] match a
[1:53:08] son of god i mean so david went down and
[1:53:11] as he was going down to the battle it
[1:53:13] says he crossed the brook
[1:53:15] and he chose five stones now you think
[1:53:18] about those stones
[1:53:19] i believe god knew he'd pick up those
[1:53:21] stones so before the foundation of the
[1:53:23] world god knew those stones and he knew
[1:53:26] where those stones would begin and where
[1:53:27] they would end and maybe no doubt as god
[1:53:29] was forming that valley and forming that
[1:53:31] brook and you know
[1:53:32] he would place those stones there and
[1:53:35] and because he'd be thinking
[1:53:36] my son's going to need these stones he's
[1:53:39] going to need these stones so i'm going
[1:53:40] to put these stones here
[1:53:42] amen for his use now there would have
[1:53:44] been maybe many other people would have
[1:53:46] crossed that
[1:53:47] brook right he wouldn't be the only one
[1:53:49] who crossed the brook
[1:53:50] and maybe other people saw those stones
[1:53:53] and thought
[1:53:54] those are good stones right
[1:53:57] that'd be perfect for a sling remember
[1:53:59] david wasn't the only man who used a
[1:54:00] sling
[1:54:02] a lot of other but they were not
[1:54:04] inspired
[1:54:05] to pick up those stones remember david
[1:54:07] didn't just like
[1:54:08] grab a whole bunch of pebbles and stuff
[1:54:10] it in his bag it says here
[1:54:14] it says here if i can find it
[1:54:17] first samuel 17 and 40 and he took his
[1:54:20] staff in his hand
[1:54:21] and chose him five smooth stones out of
[1:54:23] the brook
[1:54:24] so he actually as he is crossing that
[1:54:26] brook he was inspired to pick up
[1:54:29] those stones he chose them he didn't say
[1:54:31] this will do
[1:54:32] he you know he looked at goliath look at
[1:54:34] his weight you know what's the best
[1:54:36] stone
[1:54:37] and he was inspired to pick up a certain
[1:54:39] stone now i've got a point in saying
[1:54:40] these things
[1:54:41] so he was inspired because god knew
[1:54:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:54:45] that stone is going to end up in a
[1:54:48] forehead of a giant that's going to be
[1:54:50] its destination
[1:54:51] and my son's going to need it now in the
[1:54:54] scripture
[1:54:55] there are many verses that have just
[1:54:57] been an encouragement to people down
[1:54:59] through the ages
[1:55:00] but there's a people that come at a
[1:55:01] predestinated time
[1:55:03] and actually it's in their lives that
[1:55:05] fully manifest
[1:55:07] hallelujah just like those stones maybe
[1:55:09] others saw those stones maybe they
[1:55:10] thought they'd be useful
[1:55:11] but only one elected son of god picked
[1:55:14] them up
[1:55:15] hallelujah so i believe gardner's great
[1:55:18] wisdom and foreknowledge actually
[1:55:19] predestinated those stones who believes
[1:55:21] that
[1:55:22] i believe god you know god ordains a
[1:55:24] weapon for the age
[1:55:26] hallelujah and he thought to himself
[1:55:29] when he was forming the world my son's
[1:55:30] going to need these whitney when i send
[1:55:32] him to the earth he's going to use these
[1:55:34] stones and one of them is going to this
[1:55:35] particular one's going to kill goliath
[1:55:37] amen so it's just like the scripture is
[1:55:41] i believe in the scripture you know
[1:55:42] there's quotes in the messages
[1:55:44] there's scriptures in the bible that
[1:55:46] have been laying there for years
[1:55:48] laying there for years and many people
[1:55:50] no doubt they have
[1:55:52] read them or heard them spoken and they
[1:55:54] have given them strength and comfort to
[1:55:56] many believers down through the ages
[1:55:58] but there are certain people in a
[1:56:01] certain time that the full potency of
[1:56:03] that
[1:56:04] of that scripture will be manifested in
[1:56:06] their lives
[1:56:08] well can i have an example of that yeah
[1:56:10] sure
[1:56:11] psalm 16 9 therefore my heart is glad
[1:56:13] and mice and my glory rejoiceth
[1:56:16] my flesh shall also rest in hope for
[1:56:19] thou shalt not leave my soul in hell
[1:56:21] neither will thou suffer thy holy one to
[1:56:23] see corruption
[1:56:24] i believe many people would have read
[1:56:25] that psalm and they would have been
[1:56:26] encouraged by that psalm
[1:56:28] don't you amen they would have read that
[1:56:31] simon hallelujah
[1:56:32] my soul's not going to be left in hell
[1:56:34] god's going to take us out
[1:56:36] amen and my heart's going to be glad and
[1:56:38] all these things
[1:56:39] but this scripture was the one that
[1:56:41] jesus went to the grave with
[1:56:43] you know this was the scripture that he
[1:56:45] went to the grave with that
[1:56:47] by this one scripture he knew he would
[1:56:49] his body would not stand the grave
[1:56:51] so i'd say it's just like david with the
[1:56:53] brook many people saw those stones but
[1:56:54] david picked up that one stone
[1:56:56] they'll kill goliath and the scriptures
[1:56:58] laying there but there's when the right
[1:57:00] person comes at the right time
[1:57:02] did it have value before that it sure
[1:57:04] did did it help people before that
[1:57:06] it did but what to one it was the full
[1:57:09] potency of the revelation contained in
[1:57:11] it was manifested
[1:57:12] and jesus went to calvary as a man with
[1:57:15] this one scripture
[1:57:17] remember he had to believe the word
[1:57:18] about himself
[1:57:20] he had to believe it right and he went
[1:57:23] there
[1:57:23] he went to calvary with the scripture
[1:57:26] knowing that he his body would be in the
[1:57:28] tomb but it had to come out before
[1:57:30] corruption set in
[1:57:33] earlier brother brown would say the sin
[1:57:36] and god provide a place of worship 1965
[1:57:40] he says now notice jesus was so sure
[1:57:43] of what he was he knowed he was the son
[1:57:46] of god he knows he was virgin born
[1:57:48] he know that every scripture manifested
[1:57:50] right itself through him
[1:57:51] he noted so perfectly till he said to
[1:57:54] them builders of the temple that day he
[1:57:55] said destroy
[1:57:56] you destroy this temple and i'll raise
[1:57:58] it up in three days think of that
[1:58:00] destroy it i'll raise it up in three
[1:58:01] days
[1:58:02] why it was written of him it was a
[1:58:05] written word of him
[1:58:06] david said i'll not leave my soul in
[1:58:08] hell nor lee
[1:58:09] sorry i'll not leave my holy one and
[1:58:11] hell not leave his soul in hell
[1:58:13] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:58:15] corruption now jesus knowed
[1:58:17] what uh that that was he no question in
[1:58:21] his mind
[1:58:22] and he know that 72 hours the body
[1:58:25] corrupts
[1:58:25] sometime within that 72 hours he was
[1:58:28] going to come back to life again
[1:58:30] so he said you destroy this temple i'll
[1:58:32] raise it up again in three days why
[1:58:35] the word was written of him it was
[1:58:36] written of him because he was the
[1:58:38] manifestation
[1:58:39] of god's written word for that day well
[1:58:42] there's got to be hallelujah there's got
[1:58:44] to be brother there's got to be
[1:58:45] somewhere
[1:58:46] god's manifested word of god today and
[1:58:49] that's the same thing for he spoke of
[1:58:50] these days
[1:58:51] and he said what would take place in
[1:58:53] these days he has already told us
[1:58:55] we know what's going to take place and
[1:58:57] we see it being manifest
[1:58:58] and we see it manifested in you then
[1:59:01] you're in god's church
[1:59:02] outside of that you can call yourself
[1:59:04] methodist baptist or anything else it'll
[1:59:06] never work
[1:59:07] there's only one meeting place that's in
[1:59:08] christ jesus oh today oh how today i
[1:59:12] would uh that everybody would see that
[1:59:15] see how to
[1:59:16] get in being baptized the bride is part
[1:59:18] of her husband
[1:59:19] the church is part of the word the
[1:59:21] manifestation
[1:59:23] hallelujah so there's a he went to
[1:59:25] calvary with that scripture
[1:59:27] he following me so this i say there's
[1:59:30] stones in the bible
[1:59:31] there's scriptures in the bible and in
[1:59:33] the message that are for a predestinated
[1:59:35] people at the end time
[1:59:37] i mean many things brother brahm said
[1:59:38] it's for right now
[1:59:40] it's more current and actually real now
[1:59:42] than it was in 65.
[1:59:44] hallelujah now the word is not just a
[1:59:48] weapon
[1:59:48] but it also gives strength to the user
[1:59:50] now i'm just going to
[1:59:52] sorry i yeah i don't want to be too long
[1:59:54] but i just want you to think about this
[1:59:55] now
[1:59:55] the word is not just a weapon but it
[1:59:57] also gives strength to the user
[1:59:59] now samson samson would
[2:00:02] would would come to a place where his
[2:00:04] own people tied his arms up with with
[2:00:06] with flex
[2:00:08] and they and they actually gave them
[2:00:10] gave him over to the philistines
[2:00:12] but then when they but then when the
[2:00:14] philistines you know
[2:00:15] shouted against him it says in judges 15
[2:00:18] then the spirit of the lord came
[2:00:19] mightily upon him and the cords were
[2:00:21] upon his arms um because it became his
[2:00:24] flex that was burnt with fire and his
[2:00:26] bands were loosed off his hands
[2:00:28] and then he found himself a new jawbone
[2:00:30] of an ash
[2:00:31] and put forth his hand and took it and
[2:00:33] slew a thousand men
[2:00:35] so there he is he's bound up spirit of
[2:00:37] god comes upon him
[2:00:38] he breaks the bands and he looks around
[2:00:40] and there's a jawbone a new jawbone of
[2:00:43] an ass
[2:00:44] yeah it's amazing the devil i doubt very
[2:00:46] much the devil when that when that
[2:00:48] donkey walked along and
[2:00:49] breathed his last breath and died i
[2:00:51] doubt very much that the devil said
[2:00:53] hold on boys we're going to get rid of
[2:00:54] this thing this is a weapon of mass
[2:00:56] destruction
[2:00:57] we're going to get rid of this thing
[2:00:58] because this is going to do my kingdom
[2:01:00] great damage
[2:01:01] you know you know the power of this word
[2:01:04] the devil doesn't really believe it
[2:01:06] if he really believed how powerful this
[2:01:08] weapon was
[2:01:10] right he'd say boys we've got a we're
[2:01:12] going to get rid of this thing
[2:01:13] he tried to in the past but he just let
[2:01:15] it go
[2:01:17] because in the hands of the
[2:01:18] predestinated maybe other people saw
[2:01:20] that donkey just said
[2:01:21] hold on we're just going to leave this
[2:01:22] thing alone others have seen the bible
[2:01:24] they say we'll just leave this alone
[2:01:26] but in a predestinated hand that jawbone
[2:01:29] of that donkey was a weapon of mass
[2:01:31] destruction
[2:01:32] and it's the same thing with this word
[2:01:33] not just in the hand but in the mouth of
[2:01:35] the believer
[2:01:36] this becomes a weapon of mass
[2:01:37] destruction and then so now
[2:01:39] samson picked it up and i don't know
[2:01:42] what the philistines thought of a man
[2:01:44] he's a man
[2:01:44] there's a thousand of them a thousand
[2:01:46] men and he's this guy
[2:01:48] just broke these ropes mother thought
[2:01:49] well maybe they weren't very strong
[2:01:51] ropes anyway
[2:01:52] you know and he picks up this jawbone of
[2:01:54] a donk and he starts running at them
[2:01:57] yeah you know maybe you thought well we
[2:01:59] just hold our spears on this he's going
[2:02:01] to impale himself
[2:02:02] but it wasn't long after that they were
[2:02:04] all dead
[2:02:06] they were all dead amen so that jawbone
[2:02:08] didn't look like much on the ground but
[2:02:10] in the hands of an anointed
[2:02:11] son of god it was a weapon of mass
[2:02:13] destruction as the same thing with this
[2:02:15] message in the
[2:02:16] and the mouth of the bride it's a weapon
[2:02:19] of mass destruction against satan's
[2:02:20] kingdom it'll do great damage
[2:02:22] amen it did great damage all the way
[2:02:24] down through the ages it'll do great
[2:02:25] damage today
[2:02:27] hallelujah so it was a weapon that
[2:02:29] defeated the enemy
[2:02:31] but then after this amen
[2:02:34] he says that it came to pass that he
[2:02:37] said he cast away the jawbone out of his
[2:02:39] hand
[2:02:39] and he called that place uh rameth lehi
[2:02:43] and he was saw a thirst and called on
[2:02:45] the lord and said thou has given me this
[2:02:48] great deliverance into the hand of thy
[2:02:49] servant
[2:02:50] and now shall i die for thirst and fall
[2:02:52] into the hand of the uncircumcised
[2:02:54] saying basically you've given me this
[2:02:56] great battle but now i'm gonna die of
[2:02:58] thirst
[2:02:59] but but it says now but god claimed a
[2:03:01] hollow place that was in the jaw
[2:03:03] and there came water there out and when
[2:03:05] he drunk his spirit came again he
[2:03:07] revived
[2:03:08] wherefore he called the name thereof um
[2:03:11] in a hakori that's how he said which is
[2:03:14] in lehi
[2:03:15] unto this day so the weapon he used to
[2:03:18] kill the enemy
[2:03:19] refreshed him he said i'm not going
[2:03:22] through a battle
[2:03:23] i just i just get it refreshing
[2:03:26] hallelujah so so this word is a weapon
[2:03:28] against one but it's refreshing for the
[2:03:30] user
[2:03:32] i mean he went back to a source of power
[2:03:34] i mean i mean i mean i mean the weapon
[2:03:36] that was in his hand
[2:03:37] and he actually revived because god
[2:03:39] caused water to come out of it
[2:03:41] hallelujah god's word worked yesterday
[2:03:43] to defeat the enemy
[2:03:44] it works today to defeat the enemy and
[2:03:47] it will work forever to defeat the enemy
[2:03:50] hallelujah amen
[2:03:53] we know the prophet was instructed to
[2:03:55] store up food
[2:03:58] amen you ever use quotes against the
[2:03:59] enemy it's a weapon
[2:04:02] but it strengthens you hallelujah he was
[2:04:05] told to lay up
[2:04:06] in in the tabernacle tape load after
[2:04:08] tape load of
[2:04:09] barrel fulls of food oh thank you but
[2:04:12] god gave you a weapon but it gives you
[2:04:14] strength
[2:04:15] hallelujah amen what has this got to do
[2:04:19] with the sound of it going that's
[2:04:20] everything
[2:04:21] because remember dave was told to rise
[2:04:23] up kill your enemy
[2:04:26] hallelujah so that sound gave him
[2:04:28] strength
[2:04:29] right but but the lord went before him
[2:04:32] and killed the enemy
[2:04:34] amen so tape load after tape load see
[2:04:36] that's why you know we want revival
[2:04:39] we want god to live in our lives but if
[2:04:41] we don't give him any time apart from
[2:04:43] now how is it going to be if our minds
[2:04:46] are full of so many other things
[2:04:48] how's it yo sure we've got to think
[2:04:50] about our job we'll think about our
[2:04:52] family you know there's things we've got
[2:04:53] to think about
[2:04:54] but if we if we put our heads into
[2:04:56] netflix for the rest of the day
[2:04:58] rest of the week or games or whatever
[2:05:01] you know whatever it is
[2:05:02] if we put our heads into that how's god
[2:05:03] going to live when our spirits are so
[2:05:05] contaminated with other stuff
[2:05:08] you know we have a law of liberty we
[2:05:09] should be looking into amen
[2:05:11] hallelujah amen
[2:05:14] why did these tapes be laid up well same
[2:05:18] reason david you know
[2:05:19] god left that stone there for david my
[2:05:21] children will need this
[2:05:23] just like that donkey dying my son's
[2:05:24] going to need that jawbone
[2:05:26] hallelujah amen
[2:05:30] you see the lord did this because he
[2:05:34] knew that the word of god
[2:05:35] defeats the devil any place anytime
[2:05:37] anywhere
[2:05:39] and in his great temptation in the
[2:05:40] wilderness
[2:05:42] the lord did not use his great power on
[2:05:44] the enemy but he used the word
[2:05:46] he says now listen just a moment the
[2:05:48] word of god will defeat the devil any
[2:05:49] place anywhere anytime on any condition
[2:05:52] amen when jesus was here on earth the
[2:05:54] father was in him
[2:05:56] god was in christ to reconcile the world
[2:05:58] to himself we believe that
[2:05:59] all the fine qualities was of the father
[2:06:01] wasn't him but when he met satan
[2:06:04] look what he did he brought it into your
[2:06:06] reach and to yours and yours and all of
[2:06:07] you
[2:06:08] he never used this great gift and you
[2:06:10] get glad he brought this weapon into our
[2:06:11] reach
[2:06:13] doesn't matter how what we think about
[2:06:15] ourselves he says here's the weapon
[2:06:18] it's not you know you know this is not
[2:06:19] like a weapon that you've got to become
[2:06:21] a certain age whatever you use it no no
[2:06:23] if he put it in our reach amen
[2:06:26] when satan comes and says if thou be the
[2:06:28] son of god turn these stones to bread he
[2:06:30] said it's written
[2:06:31] men shall not live by bread alone he'd
[2:06:33] taken him up on the pinnacle of the
[2:06:35] temple
[2:06:35] jesus said it is written he took him up
[2:06:38] on the high mountain
[2:06:39] showed him the kingdoms of the world and
[2:06:41] said i'll give them
[2:06:42] all um all to you if you fall down and
[2:06:44] worship me jesus says it is written
[2:06:46] see always has written the word the word
[2:06:48] of god is a seed accepted in your heart
[2:06:50] believe it water it testify of it
[2:06:52] take it as your own personal need and
[2:06:55] god will bring it to pass
[2:06:57] hallelujah so the word is this you know
[2:06:59] the word that we live on
[2:07:01] amen is the same word that we use to
[2:07:03] defeat the enemy with
[2:07:05] hallelujah now we have to be very
[2:07:09] careful now no
[2:07:10] no i'm just going to finish with this
[2:07:12] you know the devil's like a big crow
[2:07:13] that comes along
[2:07:15] and he wants to build a nest he comes on
[2:07:18] it
[2:07:18] into our thought life and he wants to
[2:07:21] build a nest in our mind
[2:07:23] that all we think about is what he gives
[2:07:25] us
[2:07:27] amen but but we have a double barrel
[2:07:30] shotgun
[2:07:32] you know what you know what you know a
[2:07:34] birds build nest they don't build it
[2:07:35] overnight they take one twig or one
[2:07:37] branch whatever one at a time
[2:07:38] and slowly they're building and the
[2:07:40] thing is you may not be able to stop the
[2:07:42] bird flying over but you can sure deal
[2:07:44] with it
[2:07:45] you can stop it building the nest
[2:07:47] hallelujah so same thing with thoughts
[2:07:48] the devil put a thought in your mind are
[2:07:50] you gonna let him build it with another
[2:07:51] thought
[2:07:52] or you just gotta take that double
[2:07:53] barrel shotgun what's the shotgun we
[2:07:55] have the older new testament
[2:07:57] amen we have the dumbbell shotgun or the
[2:07:59] older new testament and we never
[2:08:01] it never runs out of bullets it's on
[2:08:03] fully automatic
[2:08:04] have you set it to that setting right
[2:08:06] and you have a right now to blow that
[2:08:08] bird out of the sky
[2:08:10] it depends who you allow on your land
[2:08:12] see you know what if david said oh
[2:08:14] goliath make us
[2:08:15] home here he would have made his home
[2:08:16] there basically get off you're gonna die
[2:08:18] i'm gonna kill all of you
[2:08:20] this is what's going to happen you say
[2:08:23] well what are you talking about a
[2:08:24] shotgun well brother braham says he says
[2:08:26] now if any thought comes by
[2:08:28] well maybe you know what happens is the
[2:08:29] devil anoints our emotion
[2:08:31] see we feel a certain way and then the
[2:08:33] devil takes that emotion and uses it
[2:08:35] against us
[2:08:37] you know i believe eve had a longing
[2:08:39] because she's built the way she wanted
[2:08:40] to have children
[2:08:42] she did i believe so but it wasn't the
[2:08:45] season or the time
[2:08:47] but the serpent came along and you know
[2:08:48] i began to talk about these things
[2:08:51] you following me you know this
[2:08:53] discouragement comes in the devil says
[2:08:54] oh this is why you're discouraged
[2:08:56] and he begins to get you to look at
[2:08:58] yourself he takes our emotion
[2:09:01] and then builds a nest with his thoughts
[2:09:02] upon that emotion
[2:09:04] you got to be very careful cast down
[2:09:06] everything that exalts itself above the
[2:09:08] word of god
[2:09:09] amen amen he says if any thought comes
[2:09:13] by
[2:09:14] well maybe it couldn't be so maybe get
[2:09:16] it off your mind right

[2:09:22] never let a negative thought pass
[2:09:23] through just don't let it stop anyhow if
[2:09:26] it starts through
[2:09:27] keep your mind keep your thoughts
[2:09:29] positive he says jesus
[2:09:32] don't think sitting there in a
[2:09:33] wheelchair that you're hopeless helpless
[2:09:35] you're not
[2:09:36] don't let that negative thought ever
[2:09:37] pass through or don't let it anchor you

[2:09:41] mind that's right but don't let it stop
