God bless you all this morning. How are you? Good. Happy. Be like brother. He's always happy. Let's stand. And I've got a Bible verse this morning. It's um Psalm 40:es 1-3. And it says, "I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings or my steps. He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God. Many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." It says here, "Put a new song in my mouth." When you're a bit of a songwriter, sometimes I I say I think to myself, I think, you know, in heaven there must be a lot of songs there that we haven't heard. A lot of new songs. And if I want to try and write a new song, it doesn't always happen this way, but maybe it has once you you say, "Lord, can I can I just have one? Can you just give me one of the songs that you that everyone is singing up there and give it you'll just enjoy it so much. It's a new song. It just and it will say everything that you feel, everything that you want to the way you want to worship, everything. It will just express it in a perfect way. It'll be a new song. Amen. Let's just pray this morning. Lord, we thank you that we have such glorious hope in you, Lord, that we're not following just cunningly devised fables, Lord, that are made up by somebody, Lord, but we we come to the living God this morning and we follow, Lord, the true and living God. We hear the word of God, Lord. And we just thank you so much for your truth, Lord. And we believe, Lord, that you are the way, the truth, and the life, Lord, and you're the mighty conqueror this morning, Lord, over everything that that would come against your word, Lord. You're the mighty conqueror, Lord. So, we just want to submit to you this morning. May you bless us in a powerful way. May you bless the ministry. Bless the songs, Lord. And may you just continue to put a new song in our heart, Lord. A song of praise, a song of worship, Lord, a song of victory, song of rejoicing. We just thank you so much, Lord, for for what you've done for us and for bringing us thus far. And we just love you and trust you with all of our heart, Lord. We just commit the service to your hands in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's sing um It's bubbling. Oh, it's bubbling. It's bubbling. It's bubbling in my soul. and singing and laughing since Jesus made me home. So understanding what can I do and it's bubbling in my soul and singing and laughing since Jesus made me whole. Some folks don't understand it. I cannot keep it quiet. It's bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling. Oh, it's bubbling. It's bubbling. It's bubbling in my soul and singing and laughing since Jesus made me whole. Some folks don't understand it. How can I keep it quiet? It's bubbling, bubbling, bubbling. Let's sing it one more time.

So, yeah, full day. Amen. Thank you, musicians. Thank you very much, brother Isaac. Thank you all. Amen. Let's uh turn to the scripture this morning. We're going to go to uh John And we're going to read we're going to read John chapter 1 and verses 1 to4 here. Now I know this is all very familiar I'm sure to to everyone. We're just going to start here. It says, "In the in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men." Amen. May the Lord bless his word. Let's uh bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning. If you ever need say, "Lord, don't pass me by today. Come meet me, Lord Jesus, today." Amen. Gracious Father, you see Lord all the hands that are raised. We just want to invite you this morning to where we're at today. May come speak to our hearts, Lord. May this be a very personal service. I pray. May you come and take supreme control over all of our lives. Sort of plead your blood over the service, dear God. Us here and those who are watching. May you just take complete control. We surrender our beings into your hands. We want to thank you. We can come into your great um your great supreme presence, Lord. Your great presence, oh God. Just pray, dear God, that you touch our lives. Have your way, Father. Those who are sick and body, may you heal them, Lord Jesus. Those who are troubled, whatever is going on in life, I pray that your anointing would come and take away every enemy, Lord Jesus. And may you prove your word today in our midst for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, I want to take a want to take a a a uh title if I could about taking our opportunity in his presence. Now, this is a very uh important because you got to really think why do we come to church? It's more than just to hear a preacher preach more to hear than just sing or you know sing songs and that's all the natural part of it. But there's a supernatural element to this message which is actually the most important element. Amen. Where our our Lord Jesus Christ is brother's battle cry was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. So he is the same as he was when he was standing there and talking to the woman at the well. He's the same God today and all of his power, his ability, his promises. Amen. Everything he is is exactly the same. It's just his corporal body's not here. We're going to meet him in the air. But his presence is here. His word is here. And his word has creative power. Amen. It's not just the words of a of a man, but you know, um, his word is creative power. In the beginning, you know, we didn't read it, but you read Genesis 1 and 1, you know, and, you know, verse one and verse two and so on. He says, you know, let there be the sun, let there be the moon, and let there be all these things. And and God believed his own word after you know you know as he spoke it and it became material what he said. Amen. He didn't say let there be you know light and there wasn't any light. Light came into material. Why? Because his word has creative power. He is creative power. Amen. He is the supernatural God. Now the same God that spoke all things into existence. Uh if we could just keep reading down, we drop down to verse 10 in John. You don't have to have your Bibles open, but if you want just want to follow, he says he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own. His own received him not. But as many as received him, to them uh gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but of God. And the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory is the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. So that same word, that same God condescended down and became flesh. Now I'm just going to jump to this day, the same God has become flesh today. Amen. This this word is no longer it's no longer if we can just be back in Jesus' day. No, the same Jesus is here, but now he's in a multimembered body. A he's not just in one man in the redeemer. He's now in his redeemed. Amen. So that same God that made the worlds is in you. Amen. that same creative power. I just I just I you I've probably said this many times, but I just pray it sinks in. We think who is in our midst when we come to church? Who who walks among us? Who speaks to us? Who deals with us when we're driving, when we're maybe brushing our teeth, or you the God begins to deal with us and speak to our hearts? And you know, who who joins us at our family altars? Amen. Who joins us when we read and when we pray? And you know, who's this great one &gt;&gt; that walks among us? Amen. Who is this supreme one who made heavens and earth that is with us? Cuz remember, brother Bram said, "Dear is not just in heaven, it's in you." Amen. So that same God that made all things is in you. Amen. So we got to realize we can't look back in memory lane. Sure, we enjoy what God did yesterday year. We appreciate that. We don't throw away anything he's done. We actually we gather those things with in our hearts and we remind ourselves the same God back there is the same God today. Amen. But we don't look back yesterday saying I wish I could be back there when the same one is with you right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I could say he would, you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but he'd say, "Why are you looking back in the past when I'm here?" &gt;&gt; The same God that answered prayer there, the same God that found you there, the same God that was with you there is the same God today right here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, he was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now, as um I was thinking about the woman at the well, you know, you go read John chapter 4. I've got it here, but we won't read it, but you read just just chapter 4. It's about five minutes to read. Okay? Let's just say that that whole thing was literally a five-minute conversation. What caused her to to receive or to recognize God in flesh? What caused her to do it? Because you think about it, the same God that was there was the same God in the synagogues. And he didn't actually do any physical healing to her. He just revealed her life. He began to speak to her. He began to speak about worship and all these things and her response is we know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things and he simply said I'm he and she dropped her water pot she ran into the city and told the men come see a man who's told me all I ever did is this not the Messiah you know not the Messiah but the same God was in the synagogue with the people who are looking for him and there's a man with a withered hand or a woman that was bent over for 15 odd years with an affliction and you know he healed people in their church you know God manifested himself. And they didn't say, "We know where Messiah cometh. He'll do these things." He uh they said, "Get out of here. You shouldn't be healing on our Sabbath day. You're breaking the word." You know, so so what caused what caused her to recognize him when they couldn't recognize him? The actions of the Messiah. I say it's the same thing that's in you that caused you to recognize him in your day. I mean, cuz the word, the anointed word is the Messiah. It's always been through the ages. Amen. When when Noah was anointed with a message, get in the ark, you're going to die. He was Messiah to the that age, he was standing in the ark preaching, get in ark of safety. That was the Messiah manifested in his day. When Noah, I mean, when Moses went down to Egypt, what was he? He was the anointed Messiah for for Egypt. I mean I mean I mean for the Israelites. Is this okay? Right. Well, he was the anointed word for his day, right? And then our Lord Jesus was all the the entire word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happens? He says, he says here, he says, "Then Jesus said to them again, this is after he's resurrected, "Peace be unto you. As my father has sent me, even so I send you." Amen. So the same God that sent Jesus went in Jesus, if I put it that way. Amen. And the same God that commissioned him now commissioned the disciples, "And I'm going to go in you and I'm going to send you off into the world." Amen. That your words when you speak under inspiration are not your words, they're my words. Because remember when Adam stood in the garden before the fall when he spoke things happened. He had that place under his entire dominion. He had a perfect oneness with God. Right? I mean it wasn't his carnal desire saying move things. It was actually God's own nature living through him. If he didn't want that tree there say tree move over there. The tree would move and different things and the wind would blow. You know, like brother Brand would dramatize, you know, with Eve was there and you know, that wind would blow and you know, um, you know, Eve would say, "Oh, it's a bit cold." And, you know, so so Adam would say, "Peace be still to the wind." And you know, he had supreme control, right? It was not, it wasn't his carnal self speaking those things. It was God, that deity part of him speaking, right? But then when man fell, then it's when our own human will says, "Well, I want this and I want that and what about this?" and you speak that, it just doesn't come into anything because it's a carnal will speaking, right? But then when man man gets out of the way and God steps in, it's like Moses before the burning bush, he could stand there and say, "Let there be fleas all he wanted. There'd be no fleas coming or let there be frogs or turn the water into blood." He could have done that all he wanted before the burning bush, but it would have been his own own human will speaking, right? And and those words just fall to the ground, right? But then when the Lord commissioned him in the burning bush and said and he says, "I've heard the cries of my people and I'm sending you." And basically God said to Moses, "I've come down to deliver. I'm going to step into you and I'm going to through you do the job." Right? So now under the blood of bulls and goats, Moses by inspiration could say, "Let frogs come and frogs come. Let flies come and flies come." Right? Why? Because because it was the anointed word. Now that creative power that said let there be sun, moon and stars now was speaking through a man. And brother Brand makes a like an incredible statement to me. He says now if a man under under the blood of bulls and goats can be led by God and speak a word and creative power can become material. Amen. How much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ? How much more are people under a perfect atonement where they're not just their sins aren't just covered but God annihilates their sins. He cleanses them. He dwells in them. He lives through them. How much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, it's an incredible thing when you think about that. God God dwells in us and he wants that same anointing, that same logos to speak. Amen. He is the logos, right? He is the word. So now what happens is that in the New Testament era, God steps into a person and speaks his word and then when that is spoken, then that's your opportunity to grab that promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a that that's why that's why I said taking our opportunity in his presence. See, brother Bram says that the the pillar of fire is here to release our desires to us. Amen. He says when God steps down into a service, God wants to release your desires to you. Well, what's our desires? Salvation, healing, deliverance, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Peace to come. God, the devil to be driven out. healing to come. That's the desires of our heart. Is it Lord? I want to see you live. I want to see your word put on flesh in my life. Lord, I want to see your promises become material. I don't just want to come to church and just have an intellectual conception and go home empty, but I want to go home with revelation. I want to go home with a rock in my soul of revelation that I know that you're more than able to do it. And because remember, when revelation strikes you, you know it's done. &gt;&gt; And you're not hoping. Amen. Hope is gone. Faith has taken a hold. And you know it's done. Amen. and you can walk forward in confidence. God, you're in control. I pray that all unbelief and skepticism just just driven from the building right now. I to realize our God is more than able. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's more than able to fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman at the well just had a moment, but she took her moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how much more now you and I, as Jesus would even promise, verily I say unto you, whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything. Say anything. &gt;&gt; Anything that ye shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven. Well how do you agree? It's got to be in your heart. Yes I agree. Not not just in here. How how do we how do we cause that to happen? We create an atmosphere of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're you're an atmosphere generator. You want to walk around like a thundercloud. You'll have a thundercloud atmosphere, frowns and grumpy and everything's wrong and problems and this person did this and this and this. You'll be causing an atmosphere, all right? But it won't be an atmosphere of sunshine, peace, and joy. It'll be a thunderstorm and everyone will be ducking for cover. Here comes hurricane whoever, right? Because we're atmosphere generators. Now, if that's in the negative, how much more in the positive? Amen. How much more in the positive will we can actually allow, Amen, God to take the forefront of our lives. Not our reasoning, not our emotions, not our not not our imaginations, but his word takes the forefront of our minds. Amen. Well, how do we do that? We begin to speak the promises of God. Amen. We speak love. We speak joy. We speak peace. We take the word of God and say, "Lord, anoint your word as I speak it." Amen. And you treat others with love and respect and kindness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we begin to encourage each other. The Lord is here for you, brother. The Lord is here for you, sister. He's interested in your situation. Amen. He cares about you. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He will answer in his time. You don't need to be upset about the lingering promise. Trust me, it will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will come. You say, "It's been taken a long time." It will come. Just let revelation anchor in your soul and keep feeding that revelation with praise and joy. Amen. And you'll find the problems won't bother you no more. Why? because there's an anchor in your heart. It's coming. It's already anchored in my heart. God cannot lie. God cannot fail. You say, "Well, my five senses are telling me a lot of things." When we create an atmosphere of faith, the five senses shut up. &gt;&gt; Cuz faith is the boss. Faith is supreme. Faith has muscles. Faith has hairs on its chest. Faith is not some bashful little person in the background. No. Faith is rugged. Amen. Faith is shut up five senses. I'm in control. Shut up reasoning. I'm taking the floor. You let faith take the floor. Amen. I'll tell you what, things will begin to take place in your life. Why? Cuz you've chosen, I'm only going to believe. &gt;&gt; Faith starts with a choice. &gt;&gt; Oh, God can't really do the supernatural no more. The prophet's not here. The God of the prophet. What did he do? The ministry of brother Bram was to introduce the Messiah to the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; right? And not just in an intellectual understanding. Yes, I know he's here. But in reality, I mean, where that same anointing, that same pillar of fire would come and live in your life. Amen. Where the where that transforming power of God, Amen, would take control of your being. Amen. Where your flesh would become subject to it. Amen. Where God would now be walking, talking, living in a people. That's what the message of the hour has come to do. Amen. To restore us back to the position Adam had before the fall. Amen. You say, "Oh, in the millennium when we have new bodies." No. God wants to prove it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to prove the power of the blood now. Amen. The full power of Calvary is not just that you're forgiven, though we are forgiven. Amen. Now, the full power of the blood is that God would forgive you, cleanse you, fill you with his word. Amen. That you become a living epistle ready and known of all men. Amen. That these bodies would come to the fullness of adoption, the change of these bodies. Amen. But Calvary is more than just forgiveness. No, it's that God can dwell in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So why not open your heart and say, "God, manifest in me the full power of your blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. Will you come and change my life and live in me and take me from glory to glory, victory to victory? &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we have such a such a great moment this morning. I mean, such a great opportunity when you think about, you know, for where two or three are gathered together in my name, here I am in the midst of them. Amen. That's why we got to start agreeing with the word. &gt;&gt; Start agreeing with the word. Don't agree with your circumstances. Don't agree with your problems. No. agree with the word. It doesn't mean we put our eye, you know, we put blinkers on and ignore problems. We see the problem, but we see the promise. Amen. David saw Goliath. He actually pointed Goliath out, but he had a revelation in his heart. This is an uncircumcised Philistine. This guy's going down. He can't hinder us no more. Amen. So, he did not ignore Goliath. He said, "Yeah, you're there, but you're going down." Amen. So, it's got to be the same thing with our problems. You acknowledge it. You Yeah. You say it's there. It's like brother Bram says, you know, about overcoming. You got to recognize the enemy. He says, you know, people say, try and deny sickness and cancer and so on. He says, no, no, no. That's not overcoming. You got to recognize you've got it, but recognize the God in you has already conquered that cancer. Amen. He's already conquered that mind battle. He's already conquered that problem. He's already conquered that anxiety, that fear. He's already conquered it that day on Calvary. And he's here to manifest that victory in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're well aware of the enemy. We're not afraid of him. &gt;&gt; We look beyond him to the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil wants to get up in your grill, up in your face, and just be so intimidating. You got to push him back by the word of God. Oh, God's got to do it. He wants to use you. I mean, he wants to use you for you actually stand on the word yourself. See, faith is an individual thing. I mean, young people, you can't rely on your parents' faith. No, you've got to come to a point where their God is your God. Amen. Where you can stand in the word yourself and say, "No, I'm a Christian. I've been washed in the blood, Satan. Get back in the name of Jesus Christ." Amen. where it's actually no longer just them praying for you, you're praying for them. Amen. You're lifting up your parents saying, "Let's let's go on, mom. Let's go on, Dad." There's greater heights and deeper depths to enjoy in the word of God. Amen. And you begin to create an atmosphere. You're not relaying on the relying on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you begin to have your own walk. And I believe you are having your own walk. But take it with all your hands. Take it with both hands. Take it with everything within you. Amen. This is your opportunity &gt;&gt; to shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God can do what he wants in our lives. Amen. This is this is the young people's time for a revival. This is time for the middle-aged people's time for a revival. Amen. Because the awakening of the bride. Amen. This message awakens the bride to who she really is. Amen. We our eyes come open because we know we are the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like it says in Galatians, you receive the Holy Ghost because you are sons. &gt;&gt; You don't become a child of God by the new birth. No, you are born again because you are Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That takes all the fear out of my life. Amen. No, I'm his son. &gt;&gt; I'm his child. Amen. I've got a right to take him at his word. I've got a right to come into his presence with boldness. Amen. Why? Because he said, "I want you to come." &gt;&gt; Amen. When he came down the Garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve fell, he was looking for them to restore fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted to, you know, he wanted to bring them back into his presence again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why our Lord Jesus manifests himself because he wants to bring you back into fellowship. That you would recognize I'm his son. I'm his daughter. Amen. He can't lose me cuz I'm part of him. I pray that that's just is settled in our hearts as we just go along. May 2025 be the year where it's settled in all of our hearts. I can't be lost. This is the most This world that I'm in now is the closest I'll ever get to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the closest I'm ever going to get to the le regions of the lost is is this plane of existence because I'm I'm a child of God. I ain't going down. I'm going up. &gt;&gt; I mean, it doesn't matter if I fall, I'm going to get back up. I'll fail. He'll trip me up. You know, he'll use my desires against me, use my own flesh against me, but I'm going to get back up and I'm going to keep walking cuz I'm his child. Amen. Doesn't matter how disappointed I get in myself. I'm going to get back up and keep walking. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Cuz I'm part of him and he can't lose me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray that just anchors in all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; See, we live in a condition of victory. &gt;&gt; The blood puts us in that condition. Amen. It puts us puts us in that in that state. &gt;&gt; We've won it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he won it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's done it all. Now we just enjoy it all. &gt;&gt; So why not enjoy it all? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why not enjoy his presence? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have this we have this we have this um opportunity. Brother Bram says, "Do you believe with all your heart the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always?" Amen. So that same one that led Moses, the same one that spoke to the Apostle Paul, the same one that well the angel of the Lord, what is that? That's God in angelic form. Amen. The same one that became flesh as Jesus Christ is now the pillar of fire that was in the upper room in the disciples through the book of acts down through the ages and portion right is here without measure. Amen. And where the anointed word is the angel of the lord is there to accompany the message. And that's more than just to make you feel good. It's more than just to make you feel, you know, happy. It's there that he he's there to anoint that word to your heart &gt;&gt; to fulfill it. This is why he's here. This is why we have church. &gt;&gt; Amen. That God would inspire a minister, whoever it is, it doesn't matter, but he'd inspire a minister with the needs that we have, &gt;&gt; the questions we have, the things we're going through. Amen. And God inspires them. They don't know what's going on in your life, but you know, it's like you're driving here to church. You begin to talk about something. And then the brother gets up and preaches what you've just talked about or maybe a conversation, maybe the Sunday school, maybe something like that, you know, and then why does God do that? God wants to get your attention. That that's your opportunity. Amen. To take him at his promises. Amen. To to to take that word that you've heard and say, "Lord, that's for me." I mean, you may be going through a real anxious time, trouble at home and questions and what's going on in the world and all these things. And then God begins to come down that line of thought. He's giving you an opportunity. That's where you take faith and say, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's mine." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like It's like the woman at the well. Amen. Her faith was always in her heart. We know where Messiah cometh, he'll do these things. She was looking for the Messiah, but she had no idea where to look for him. There was something in her that was crying out for expression. Amen. This is you now I'm talking about. I mean, there's something in you crying out for expression cuz we are the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. We tried all different kind of religions. We had all whole bunch of dead husbands. Amen. And then, you know, we tried the world. We tried popularity. We tried all these different kind of things. We tried just being a nice good message person. But then one day the god of the message came our way. Why? Because there's an attribute crying out for expression and none of those things could bring it to life. Just like her, you know, she got married the first time. Maybe that was her true love and it all seemed fine. And you know, but but you you maybe that broke up, there was trouble. She was looking for love in all the wrong places, hurt and damaged and you know, but isn't it amazing? Her complexes did not hinder her recognizing Messiah. Her past did not hinder her recognizing Messiah. Her mind battles do not hinder her recognizing Messiah. Nothing that had happened in her life hindered her from recognizing Messiah. And why is that? Because what we recognize them with is not our mind. It's not our intelligence. It's not if we're having a good day or not or having a, you know, a happy time and we have no problems. That does not recognize him. It's not our spirit realm. It's that faith seed. Amen. It's that predestinated seed in our soul. Amen. Recognizes him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know she dropped her word. But but she had her she had her moment. She recognized her opportunity. &gt;&gt; Because it's amazing when they first start talking, she basically says, "You have no dealings with me. You're a Jew. I'm a Samaritan. You shouldn't be talking to me." And sometimes we maybe feel like that with the Lord. Why? You have actually no dealings with me, God. But I want to do my own thing. She was interested in one thing that day. Getting water from the well. &gt;&gt; He had one thing on his mind that day. Her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Finding her. Opening her eyes. Praise the Lord. It's the same thing with us. Normally, we're caught up in our little world. Maybe it's just church mechanics. Maybe it's just life and different things. But then he's got one thing on his mind. I'm going to interrupt your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to talk to you. I'm going to reveal myself to you that when we finish our conversation, you're not going to be the same person that when we started that conversation. Amen. That burdens will be dropped. Unbelief will be gone. Amen. Faith rose in her heart. Cuz she she said, "We know when Messiah cometh, he'll do these things." And when he said, "He that speaks to thee am he." She didn't debate that. &gt;&gt; She dropped her water pot because her basically her dropping of her water pot was a yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I take you at that. Amen. And she ran to the city. Why? Because that was her opportunity. Amen. And she embraced it and she took it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Bram says that there's when the anointing comes into a church, I just read this. He says, "This is from God hiding himself in simplicity. So help me. I can stand right here and go down the aisle after I tell you everyone where you're at and what you've done. I say that in the name of the Lord Jesus." You know that's true. And I see you're afraid to turn yourself loose. You're scared of something that something's there's something wrong. God, don't make a promise then go back on it. We can't be afraid to turn ourselves loose. &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of? This is God trying to get our attention because he says that the angel Lord will circle the building. &gt;&gt; Looking looking for an open heart &gt;&gt; to come and dwell in. Looking for an open open heart that he can anoint that person and set them free. This is what God does. You see, God puts out an opportunity, but then we've got to receive our opportunity. We got to take God at his word at that moment. Amen. We can't just expect him because he's got because he respects our free moral agency. He doesn't force anything upon us, but he but he offers an opportunity and it's up to us if we'll receive it or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he says, "You're afraid to turn yourself loose." I say, "Let's not let fear hinder us anymore." What are we afraid of? Whoa. Well, what happens if I open up my heart and then I find myself dancing around the church? Is that a problem? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that a problem? &gt;&gt; Or what if I start crying cuz I never cry and I just start balling my eyes out. Is that a problem? &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of? &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of? Because if it's God doing it, that's God. &gt;&gt; God had dancing way before the devil had it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had shouting way before the devil ever had it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Why let what the devil's done with the truth hinder us from the truth? &gt;&gt; Look what the Catholics have done with Calvary, with the with the birth of Jesus. Do we throw it away? &gt;&gt; No. Those things are true. &gt;&gt; Then why do we let these things become scarecrows about letting God manifest himself? &gt;&gt; Well, you say that was in a Pentecostal age. God adds to his word. &gt;&gt; God adds to his word. He doesn't subtract. Amen. So everything they had at Isusa, we've got more because we've got the indwelling presence of God more than just the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So you So we can't be afraid that, oh, but what happens if I get begin to act out of order or out of character? Let God do what he wants to do. Why are we afraid? &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants us. He says, God, don't make a promise, then go back on it. You know, when we stand here and give out promises, I didn't give a single one of them. Right? The prophet did not give a single one a unique promise that he gave. It's all from the scripture. It's all God's promises being preached. &gt;&gt; Right? So, it's not it's not my promise. It's his promise. It's not Malachi 4's promise. It's God's promise. Right? But God inspired it in the season to show that the full word of God has come into manifestation. So God So if God gave the promise, he's the one that will prove the promise or bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the truth right here. If you want it, it's up to you. It's your death. It's your burial. It's your expectation. Um I mean I mean it's your exception. Uh there's the word. So help me. The Holy Spirit is here. So help me. Jesus Christ is in here. Have I ever told you anything wrong? He's here. But there's something I was standing there watching that. See that light circling right across the building here. Just go back and forth. Oh my. There you go. That's it. That's the way. Struck a little lady over here. That's the way it struck another one. There you go. There it is. See that? See there's the time to accept it while it's here. see glory. Amen. It could it would strike some here. Praise be to God. There you are. Amen. What's happening is the as as people open up their hearts and God begins to strike them. You can hear them as crying out and screaming as God is anointing them, changing their lives. &gt;&gt; He's the same God today. &gt;&gt; He hasn't changed. He's the very same God with the prophet is the same with the bride. He hasn't diminished in power, ability, anointing, or anything of his strength. He's exactly the same God. Amen. It's like, you know, John the Baptist introduced the disciples and different ones to Jesus, right? And then John went off the scene. Jesus went with them or they went with Jesus. Brother Bram did the same thing. The same Messiah, he introduced the the living word, the logos, God himself is the same God that's with you and I. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Jesus promised that. He says, "Even the spirit of truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but you know him, for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you." This is more than just to the disciples. This is to you and I in 2025. He says, "He's with you, but he's going to be in you." Amen. He says, "I'll not leave you comfortless. I'll come to you. Yet a while, yet a little while the world seeth me no more, but you shall see me. Because I live, ye shall live also." Amen. At that day you shall know that I am in my father, ye in me, and I in you. He says, he that hath my commandments and keepeth them. He it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and I'll love him, and will manifest myself to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord never left in 1965. He never left in some other year. That same God &gt;&gt; is with us today. I just want this to sink in real good. But the thing is this the same one that found you is the same one that's still with you. Amen. He has not left. He is not there part of the time. He says he says I will be with you. Brother Ram says it's a personal pronoun. You may not have thought of it that way. He says it's a personal pronoun. I will be with you even in you to the end of the world. Amen. The world won't see me but ye shall see me. Amen. And that's how you know you're not of the world because you see him. Amen. You see I mean God manifest his word. Amen. You see God in in his people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see God in yourself. Amen. There. But the world may look at you say, "There's nothing special about you. What's going on here?" You know, you're just a religious person. It's cuz they're of the world. But those who are of Christ see him. They see the message of the hour. They see God unveiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we all together this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you're not of the world because you can you you see him? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother Brown makes these statements. Sorry for a bit of reading, then we'll probably go off the reading. But I just want to read this. The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today. It's just the same as it was back uh uh was back in the day of our Lord. It was receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live. Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word. He knew that if the people got the word, the works would follow that is Bible. Amen. Now Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift from the word in the Pergamian age which was um was as yet 200 years from the Patmos vision. He knew that that drift would cause him to go into the dark ages. He knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word. If you leave the word, you have left God. Thus he is presenting himself to the church at Pergamos and indeed to all churches of all ages. I am the word. If you want deity in your midst, then welcome and receive the word. Amen. What a great powerful statement is. If you want, who wants deity in their midst? Who wants him? Who wants more than religion or a nice idea, but who wants the very God of glory to be in their midst? Amen. And not just at church, but in your everyday life. He says, "Then welcome and receive the word." Amen. If your thought is contrary to the word, lay your thought aside. Amen. If your reasoning is contrary to the word, lay that aside and receive the word. Amen. That's how you welcome it. You say, "Lord, your word is right and I'm wrong compared to your word." Amen. But you welcome and receive the word. Don't let anyone or anything get between you and that word, which is this which I'm giving you. The word is a revelation of myself. I am the word. Remember that. I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst. &gt;&gt; I mean, are we sufficiently are we adequately impressed? Are we adequately or sufficiently impacted by the word in our midst? Oh, it's just a bunch of sermons. It's more than that. Oh, it's just a bunch of tapes. No, it's more than that. Oh, it's just a healing ministry. Way more than that. Amen. Now, what is it? It is Jesus Christ, the Messiah unveiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is he? And where is he unveiling himself? In his bride body. Amen. He's manifesting his word through you and I. Amen. It's not just in brother Brand's ministry no more. No, that same voice is coming to you. Amen. That same anointed word is coming to you. Amen. So, are we sufficiently impressed with that? Well, what is that? God himself, creator of heavens and earth, deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Are we s sufficiently impacted? We think, man, I'd love to be back in the days of Jesus when he I would have loved to been there, too. Or days of Moses to see the Exodus or Noah or, you know, the great incredible times of, you know, the Bible. But we're living in Bible days. &gt;&gt; The same God is here today. Amen. The same one who walked there on the shores of Galilee is the very same God that's present here right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's in you, he's present. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's dwelling in your soul, who's who's received a true new birth, receive the Holy Ghost, then he's here right now. &gt;&gt; He's here right now. He's not just in heaven. He's here right now. Amen. He's here right now. Amen. He's sitting in pews. He's standing here. Amen. He's He's saying amen. He's preaching the word. Amen. He is living through his people. Amen. He is manifesting himself. You say, "I've never seen God." Look around. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've never seen the word made flesh. Look around. Amen. And then you begin to realize, "Amen. I wasn't saved by a religion. I wasn't saved by history. I wasn't saved by accepted culture. I wasn't saved by a church. No, I was saved by almighty God." Amen. That that same one who made Sun, Moon, and Stars, Amen, found me. And you know, do you know the big thing you got to realize? What caused you to receive it? &gt;&gt; It's the same thing that caused the woman at the well to receive it. Brother Anne began to speak about in the future home. He said that the woman at the well had representation in heaven. Amen. The scribes and Pharisees had no representation in heaven which is a theophony. So when she saw Messiah, when she saw the Messiah living, acting, speaking, something in her said that's him because she had representation in heaven. She didn't work it out with her mind. She didn't work it out because of culture. She didn't work it out because of what she could put together with her own thinking. No, it was because she had representation in heaven. Amen. It's the same thing with you and I, friends. When this message becomes more than a voice of a man, but you hear that voice behind the voice, you hear that anointed word. You hear God revealing himself. Amen. Through the prophet messenger, what's happening? You're hearing from your theophony. You are you do that because you have representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And that representation was there. It's an eternal representation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it was there before the devil ever was made. Before the devil ever fell and became Lucifer, before he ever had a scheme in his mind of I'm going to destroy the world and I'm going to be God over the world and I'm going to take the sons of God captive and I'm going to be like God. Before that thought ever came into his mind and came into maturity, you had representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why you turn down the devil's lie. Amen. in his way. You've got representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. That should make you shout a little bit, shouldn't you? Shouldn't you? Yeah. We realize no. Before the devil became the devil, there was part of me. Amen. That I had representation. I had a theophony. Amen. Up in glory. Amen. Because that's there. I cannot fall. I cannot be lost. Amen. I cannot be cast away. Amen. No. Why? Because I I'm an attribute of God upon the earth. Hallelujah. Are we sufficiently impressed by this one? Before there was anything thought of you, thought of the time you'd be living in, thought of the knew the things you'd go through, knew the troubles you'd go through, knew the world's condition when you were here. And he says, "I'm going to prove my word by placing them in Lady Oia. I'm going to prove my word by putting them in this lukewarm country of New Zealand. I'm going to prove my word." &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz I'm going to put them here and they're not going to be succumbed by the enemy. They're not going to be destroyed by the spirit. But no, they're going to put it under their own feet. &gt;&gt; I mean, they're going to walk with me. They're going to know me. I mean, I'm going to prove my word through their lives, and I'm going to reveal myself to them. Hallelujah. Are we sufficiently impressed? &gt;&gt; You ain't saved by doctrine. &gt;&gt; You ain't saved by human uh human influence. &gt;&gt; It's almighty God. &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed? &gt;&gt; It was him. The same one that made all things is the same one that's drawing you. &gt;&gt; The one who gave the promise is the one here to fulfill every promise. &gt;&gt; Has it impacted enough us? Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I could put it in words. I really wish I could. &gt;&gt; But has it gripped us? Has it really caught our imagination? Caught our attention? God more than religion. This ain't about Shikina Tabernacle or any other kind of church. No, it's more than that. It's God bringing his word to you. I mean, the same God where people have been looking and debating about the lamb taking the book and when's it going to happen and what the seals are and all these things to wind up his plan of redemption, that same one took that book, gave the revelation of it to the prophet. We become one with that revelation and now we're speaking its contents. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we know where we are in the plan of redemption. Has that impressed us enough that we've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and this message has come to claim you? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I know I'm throwing out some statements, but I just want you to think about has this thing, wow, I have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Has that impressed you enough? Has it sufficiently impacted you? I am actually I cannot be lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Has it also sufficiently impressed us that it doesn't matter what the enemy does, he is a defeated being. And our God is a mighty conqueror. And there's nothing that is too deep, too long, seems to be too much of someone that God cannot undo. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no unbelief that God can't un undo. &gt;&gt; There's no complex. There's no hurt. There's no trauma. There's nothing that it could be generations of of of trauma and abuse, but God can undo it all in a moment. &gt;&gt; Are we sufficiently impressed? Because he made the human spirit. He made our bodies. Amen. He made every part of the facet of our being. He knows he know see the m you like brother said about you know there was a man and he was a mechanic and he was trying to fix a car and he you know took it apart and he just tried to put it back together. He just could not get the thing going. He spent days and he's getting frustrated and you know but then one day a man in a suit walks into his uh automotive shop and there he is. He's you this mechanic's all frustrated under the car trying to tinker with things and he just hears a voice. What's wrong with the car? And you know the mechanic's no doubt all frustrated. Well, if I knew that maybe he thought if I knew that I wouldn't be here right now but you know he tries to explain the problem and you know all these things. And then this guy in the suit says, "Um, replace that valve, the spark plug. This needs changing. I'm not a car guy, so I can't just make stuff up, but just basically fix this and this and this." And the mechanic's like, "That's weird, but okay, I'll do it." He does it. He puts the key in the ignition. The thing just purr like a kitten, revs away. And then the mechanic looks at this guy and says, "How did you know what is wrong with this car?" He says, "Well, I designed it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about &gt;&gt; cuz I made the car. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how I know how to fix it. &gt;&gt; We've been made by God. &gt;&gt; He's the master mechanic. Amen. He knows every part of our being. Amen. He can fix us because he made us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We don't have to go through years of psychology trying to work out who we are and our problems. Just come into his presence one time. Amen. Let him reveal yourself to you. Amen. And you will begin to see actually this is who I really am. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. The chief mechanics here. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I can't he can't fix this. He He made the universe, man. &gt;&gt; Let's just put this in perspective. He made this planet by his spoken word. The body that you're made out of is his spoken word. The materials, the atoms, the, you know, all those things. &gt;&gt; So, if he made that, he just said, "Let there be." Boom. Is anything too hard for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Oh, but medically it's impossible. They go by what they see. &gt;&gt; We appreciate them. We go by what God sees. &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a present help in time of trouble. By your by my stripes, you're healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just said that in first person, but the Lord says by his strip, you know, by his stripes, we're healed, right? Amen. That's how he sees it. That's what we should be looking to. But then also we sufficiently impressed if that same one is now in us. Are we sufficiently impressed with the power that lays within the believer or the authority that lays in the believer? Are we are we sufficiently impressed by that? &gt;&gt; You know, because if we realize, no, I am a son of God. I'm made as a as brother Bram says a messiah, right? We are messiahs upon the earth. &gt;&gt; We're not saviors, but the same savior is now within us. We're anointed with the same spirit. Right? You see a church that's fully surrendered to the Lord according to his word. I think brother says, "I'll show you a Messiah &gt;&gt; upon the earth. I'll show you an anointed people." &gt;&gt; Amen. So if that same anointing is within us, do we realize the authority that we have? &gt;&gt; Do we? &gt;&gt; You know, it's like a little bitty policeman. Brother Bram says, little bitty guy hat half over his ears. He can barely stand in the uniform. It's just too big. You know, that guy would be a pushover. Nothing. He could stop nothing. But he's got an authority behind him. that when he goes out on the street, it doesn't matter how big that truck is coming his way. He can blow his whistle in order to stop and that thing's got to stop because he's got authority in the uniform that he's wearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's got a badge of a policeman. He's got the full the full power of that police force is behind him, right? And then if it gets too heavy, they'll call in the military. Amen. We have a badge of a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother says, "We don't have any power, but we got good authority." &gt;&gt; Right? That we But you have you have to use that badge yourself. You've got to use your God-given authority. Amen. To push the enemy back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "Man is omnipotent." That means all powerful. You don't believe that he is. A man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent. Who's fully surrendered to God today? I mean, did he not say in Mark 11:22, "Whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart, it will come to pass. You can have what you've said." What happens when two omnipotents meet? When God and man comes together, two omnipotents, something's got to shake. I mean, whatever you'd you'd say with that creative power of the omnipotence of God, knowing that he's promised it. And he said it in his word, it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass, things that is not, and makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met. There he stands. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. So when two So that's why I say you've got to take your opportunity. I mean because you're omnipotent, he's omnipotent. When they come together, something's got to shake. And when you realize the logos of God, God himself is speaking and he releases his creative word. You take them into your heart. Say, "Yes, amen. Lord, you're more than able to do it." Amen. Respond with an amen. Amen. What's happening then? Then what happens? Something's got to shake. Something's got to move. Amen. Because I think we've been too long trying to move things with psychology and nice ideas and power of positive thinking. Why don't we let God move things? How he ordained things should move. Amen. By the power of his word by having faith in his word. Because even Jesus was asked, how do we do the works of God? And Jesus said, believe on him who he has sent. &gt;&gt; That's how you do the works of God. Oh, I want to do the works of a Christian. Believe on him who he has sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll find the works of God will follow. I believe this word. &gt;&gt; I believe God sent this word to this generation. I mean, I believe this message is for this end time. I believe it does make the bride of Jesus Christ. I believe it reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And something's got to shake. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to sit there and wrestle with things and how we're going to work things out. No. Bring omnipotence on the scene. &gt;&gt; Bring him on the scene and see what happens. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't know if that could ever happen." Just get a breakthrough in prayer. &gt;&gt; You know, you know when that peace comes, who who's ever prayed for something and just a peace comes settles. &gt;&gt; What's that? Now something's shaking. &gt;&gt; Something's going to shake now. Why? Cuz God has given you an answer. You don't see it. You don't maybe not hear it, but God's given you a piece. I've got this. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's calling omnipotence on the scene. Amen. And then God begins to take that now and make it material. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen that so many times. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is more than able. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not back in 2020 20, you know, 2012 or wherever when he, you know, he's the same God today. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happens when we let ourselves go and let God have his way. And that's when we say we're no longer afraid of how we'll act. We may not act nothing but just let God take complete control. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He says, "My word," our Lord Jesus says, "so so my word uh that goeth forth um out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void. It shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." Amen. So God sent his word. It's going to produce what he says it will produce. Amen. When our Lord Jesus, you know, he would he would there stand there in the um synagogue. He'd read from Isaiah how the spirit of the law is upon me to bind out the brokenhearted sit at liberty them that are bruised release the captives and all these things. And what did he say this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears. Amen. And so so what was happening is he said he's saying this is the word that I sent and here I am to fulfill it. Take your opportunity. They didn't take their opportunity. They said, "But Joseph's his father, Mary's his mother, he lives here, and they were offended at this guy who was a little kid in their village, was a teenager, a young person, now he's 30. Now he's declaring he's the Messiah." But he was. They didn't have within them what they needed to recognize him. But we do, I believe, by God's grace. I know I'm kind of going around in a cycle, but I want to keep going around the cycle. Okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. His word will produce what he says it will produce. Now, brother Ram says this, "And what was the Holy Ghost given for?" That's the purpose of the Holy Ghost is the father again, God the Father dwelling in you, working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption, working through you, making you a co-worker with him, giving you a place. I like that. Giving you a part for your fallen, lost brother and sister, giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden. Adam, Adam, where art thou? That's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and it takes its abode. There's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls. That's what's the matter with the meeting today. There's not enough spirit touch in it. Amen. To go to the souls of the lost and the dying. We must never let the spirit of God leave our church. &gt;&gt; Every service must have a spirit touch &gt;&gt; where God comes and anoints his word to our lives. It may be very dynamic. It may not be. That's irrelevant, &gt;&gt; right? But it's got to have a spirit touch in it that motivates us now. Lord, my fallen brethren, &gt;&gt; my family, Lord, &gt;&gt; my neighbor, Lord, someone on the street, Lord, that we want, we have a hunger for the lost and dying souls. It's more than to take a name or a church or a building or denomination instead of a soul-winning program. How pitiful. We could stay on it much. God poured himself into Christ. Correct. God poured himself into the church. Therefore, now watch. At that day you shall know that I am in the Father and you are in me and I in you at that day and you'll know it. For it's the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down that God coming back to live and dwell with and commune with his to his people as he did at the beginning. Now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions, gets his church to a place we can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship, then there will come an Eden. He'll take his church back to where it left him uh back to a to an Eden again. That's where it fell. Uh that's where uh it made its first start or fall. That's where it'll be taken right back to with every clean slate um slate of redemption, bringing them back uh straight back to that place again. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God's given you a place in his plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God works through man. He could have had the stars preach, the wind, nature preach the gospel, but he's chosen you. Amen. To be a part of his plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this is important because we got to realize we have a job to do. Amen. You've got a part of this. This is not us being passive. No, this is us being active in the kingdom of God, allowing him to live through our lives. I mean allowing him to to to prove his word because we want everyone to have an opportunity in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen, don't we? And it's more than just within these four walls. So this is a good place to start, right? But we, you know, because of the Holy Ghost when it comes into our life, it creates an atmosphere because why? The Messiah has put on flesh again. Christ has put on flesh again that now people can have an opportunity, amen, to get what they have need of. Amen. I'm just going to finish with this because time is gone. I've been thinking about this a lot recently. There were four friends. They had a crippled friend. He couldn't walk. But these four friends recognized that Jesus was in the house. They recognized the Messiah was on earth. Amen. And they believed if they could just get their friend into the presence of God, then God would do the rest. Because they just knew if I can just get him to talk to them. I mean, him to talk to our friend, right? Just get him get him into his presence, then now the Messiah can do what the Messiah does. Amen. He's Jehovah of miracles, right? He's a supernatural God. Amen. There's nothing he cannot do. Amen. And brother Bram says it's like when you come into his presence, the supernatural is happening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, so they had a burden on their heart. We've got to get our friend to where he is. &gt;&gt; Now, they were not afraid to be unconventional to get their friend into his presence. They would have tried the front door. They couldn't get near the front door because of the press of the people. But their faith would not take no for an answer. Amen. They had a revelation anchored in their heart. Messiah is upon the earth. Amen. We must get him there and you know he couldn't walk. So they pick him up. They go towards the house. There's too many people. But their faith did not take that as an option. I mean their faith said he must get at his feet. I mean so they take him up on the roof. They didn't ask permission to get rid of those tiles. They begin to put a skylight into that guy's house. Hallelujah. Why? Because that roof was an obstacle that they weren't willing to stop at. Amen. No, their faith was going to go through the roof. and low their friend. Amen. It's the same thing with you and I. There's a lot of roofs over a lot of people. Amen. There's skepticism. There's unbelief. There's complexes. There's anxiety. There's doubts. There's trouble past. There's problems. Those are a lot of roofs, right? But we have faith to take down the roof. Amen. To create an atmosphere. Amen. That we are determined. Lord, if you just speak to them, Amen. Lord, if you just start speaking to them, then you will begin to do what only you can do. Amen. That's why it's so important when you come to the house of God, praise him. &gt;&gt; Give him glory. Amen. Doesn't matter what you're going through. We're not here to worship our problems. We're not here to worship what we're going to face tomorrow. No, we're here to worship the true and living God. Amen. Because God inhabits the praises of his people. Amen. You begin to praise God. You may not be loud. It doesn't matter. It's what's in your heart. Let it come out. I mean, as long as he's moving, think of the goodness of God. Don't get caught up in your troubles. We all have troubles. Don't let that be your main thing. &gt;&gt; Let him be your main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happens? You begin to create an atmosphere and God comes down. He inhabits that praise. Amen. Because he loves to inhabit the praises of his people. Amen. Then then God begins to move in the service. And then you begin to your faith begins to pull on whatever gift is standing in front of you. God, speak to me, Lord. Speak to my daughter. Speak to my son. Speak to that brother. Speak to them. And you're not in a condescending way, but you know, you know what he can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he begins to talk to someone. And then what does that do? You create an atmosphere of love. You begin to express yourself to God. And God steps into that praise. More than angels gathering around. God himself steps in. Hallelujah. What's happening? Tiles are flying. &gt;&gt; Tiles are flying off roofs. Amen. And then you get that person down to the prince of God and their mind is maybe wandering all the way around to tomorrow, the next week. Then they start to focus in. What's happened? Messiah now begins to speak. Begins to speak to their need and their trouble and their situation. And the whoever is preaching has no idea what they're going through because that doesn't matter. But God knows all about it. And then he begins to speak to them. And then they begin to be dealt with by God. And what do they do? What's the first thing God says? Thy sins be forgiven thee. Don't let that thing hold you down anymore. I mean, don't let that anxiety, that weight be your trouble. No, I'm here to alleviate that thing. Amen. Then what do you do? Instead of being carried in that bed of affliction and this is my problem, this is what I'm going through. Amen. You carry that thing out of the building. Hallelujah. You don't need to worry about what's going on. No, you're carrying that thing as a trophy. &gt;&gt; I was on this bed. This anxiety ruled me. This fear gripped me and it crippled me. I couldn't walk as I should. And I was so worried and anxious. But then he spoke to me. &gt;&gt; He spoke to me. Amen. And said, "You're fine. My blood's covered you. It's everything's taken out. Everything's under control. Now take that thing and carry it &gt;&gt; and be a living witness. Amen. That the Lord took me off this the other day. Hallelujah. And then people begin to see that. They say, "What happened to you?" Let me tell you. You won't believe it, but I believe it because it happened. I was once lost. I was in the world. I was crippled up with fear, anxiety, problems. I thought I could never be right with God. I thought I'd gone too far. But then my friends, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, they look beyond. We're friends, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we love to see when everyone comes into church? Praise God. &gt;&gt; My friends are here. Amen. Believers are here. Something's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Messiah's going to come into the house. Amen. Touch somebody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But then my friends got me into his presence. Then he began to speak to me &gt;&gt; and I knew he knew things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew things no one else knew. &gt;&gt; But he told me one thing. Thy sins be forgiven thee. Take up this bed and walk. &gt;&gt; This is what church is about. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is because remember it says this is why I put it in yellow. When Jesus saw their faith, &gt;&gt; it didn't say it nothing to do with the crippled man's faith. People think, "Oh, but they don't believe and they're not even interested in God." Get them into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Your faith will cause them to have a one-on-one interview with the Messiah. &gt;&gt; When he saw their faith, when Jesus saw their faith, that same faith is in you. &gt;&gt; That same faith, cuz there's something in us, Lord, if I can just get that person in your presence. If I can just Lord just get rid of those tiles, get them into where you are, then you can deal with them. &gt;&gt; Who believes that &gt;&gt; that same faith is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So why not put in some skylights? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you Oh, there's a lot of obstacles. It doesn't matter how many obstacles there are. Faith does not take no for an answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is not satisfied with a problem and staying there. No. faith bulldozes through sir &gt;&gt; because they had a revelation all we need to do is get him there &gt;&gt; and everything will take care of itself because he will begin to work &gt;&gt; hallelujah amen we have the musicians please this morning I want to leave it there this morning now God has moved this morning &gt;&gt; he's been moving he's been speaking he's been anointing this is an opportunity Amen. You can receive it in your seat. &gt;&gt; You can come get prayer. You're very welcome. But you can receive it in your seat as we're singing, as we're worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is not limited to here or the back or wherever. But why not why not open your heart and say, "Lord, fill me once again. &gt;&gt; Refill me with your presence, Lord. Lord, all I want is you. All I want is your presence, oh God. All I want is to see you live that I can return it back with praise. Amen. That's Lord. That's the only reason I want to see you prove your word is so I can praise you. Amen. For who you are and what you've done and what you're doing. Amen. You say, "Well, I can't pull off the roof. I know I've got a lot of crippled people that I can't get the roof off." Let faith grip. Let faith get a hold. And you'll see those things begin to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we?

Aren't you glad that there's something in you that can recognize the Messiah? Amen. His creative word. Amen. Gracious father, we just want to pray uh this afternoon. Lord, for this service, we I just want to say thank you, Lord, that you've given us an ability to see, Lord, to see you, oh God, in this day. Thank you, Lord, that we don't have some religious critical spirit, Lord, but you've given us a real spirit of faith, Lord Jesus. Lord, to recognize Messiah. Recognize you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Recognize you're in our presence, my God. Recognize you're here to manifest yourself, to prove your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Father, I just pray, dear God, that may the creator of power of your word, Lord, your word might anchor into all of our souls and may it bring forth, Lord, a hundfold of you, Lord, of your word, Lord Jesus. May you grant it. And I pray, Father, for anyone here, Lord, who does not recognize you, hasn't seen you, Lord. May you open their spiritual eyes, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. And may they see that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And dear God, I pray you'd help us, Lord. We have loved ones. We have family. We got friends, people that we care about, Lord Jesus, that are crippled in sin, crippled in indifference or skepticism or tradition, whatever it may be. Lord, we want to get them into your presence, my God, that you can speak to them supernaturally, Lord Jesus, that they can get up, get off, get up out of that thing. Get up out of that grave, out of that cot, Lord, and walk with you. Granted, Father, so give us wisdom, Lord, how to do that, Lord Jesus. I believe we can remove faith can remove every obstacle. So may you help us, father, anchor real revelation in our hearts how to do it, Lord, for your glory. We love you, Lord, and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Amen.

We're so thankful, Lord, that we can say we are family. Lord, we are family because we're one in Christ, Lord Jesus. We're so glad that we could have these years together, Lord Jesus. As you would, Lord, in your great grace and I believe a great blessing upon us, you would bring the Inquano family, Lord, from South Africa here to Wellington. Father, it's been such a blessing to have them, Lord, to watch them grow, Lord Jesus. Not just uh naturally of the children growing up, but spiritually, Lord Jesus, to see you express yourself through all of their lives. We want to thank you for this, my God. And now, Lord Jesus, there's a change of season. They have the Lord, they're going to Perth, and we're very sad naturally in our hearts to see them go because we love them. But Lord, we know that our footsteps are ordered of you, Lord Jesus. So, Father, I pray you continue to guide their steps. Lord, I ask Lord Jesus that just naturally everything would would would slot into place. Lord, the moving, the immigration and Lord, everything, Father, finding a house, Lord Jesus, all these things just just may be such a smooth, easy transition. But Lord, more so spiritually, Lord God, I pray that Lord, they would go from strength to strength, Lord, and you. May you continue to pour yourself in, continue to mature them, continue to flow through their life, Lord, no matter where they go, Lord God. May people truly say those are real Christians. &gt;&gt; Lord, they really know you, Lord. That's what we want, Lord Jesus. May you bless them and keep them, Father.
