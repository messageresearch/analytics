[21:25] thank you Lord Jesus
[21:35] we're standing let's go to a bye
[21:38] everyone
[21:38] we'll go to Matthew 13 verse 24
[22:21] Matthew 13 verse 24 another parable put
[22:25] he forth unto them saying the kingdom of
[22:28] heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
[22:30] good seed in his field but while men
[22:33] slept his enemy came and sowed tares
[22:35] among the wheat and went his way can see
[22:39] even here in this first verse and this
[22:41] parable that it's speaking of what's
[22:43] taking place in the Garden of Eden
[22:45] while Adam slipped an enemy come in and
[22:47] so to see it goes on but when the blade
[22:51] was sprung up and brought forth fruit
[22:54] then appeared the tares also so now as
[22:57] Adam's seed comes forth and starts to
[23:00] manifest so does Cain's Cain comes out
[23:03] the servants fruit and it's it's those
[23:09] two vines and the Bible all the way
[23:12] through us always twins whenever it is
[23:14] coming forth the seed of God is coming
[23:15] forth the seed of Satan at the same time
[23:18] verse 27 so the servants of the house
[23:21] holder came and said unto Him sir did us
[23:24] not thou sow good seed in thy field from
[23:27] whence then hath it tares and he said
[23:30] unto them an enemy hath done this the
[23:33] servants said unto Him wilt thou then
[23:36] that we go and gather them up remember
[23:39] there was a protection placed over Cain
[23:41] that he wasn't to be killed he was kept
[23:45] out of the garden away from the presence
[23:47] but he wasn't to be killed but he said
[23:51] nay least while you gather up the tares
[23:53] ye root up also the wheat with them let
[23:55] both grow until the harvest and in the
[23:59] time of the harvest I will say to the
[24:00] Reapers gather ye together first the
[24:02] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[24:05] them but that gather the wheat into my
[24:07] barn please just pray Heavenly Father
[24:12] Lord we just I really just pray Lord
[24:14] that had helped me to bring forth a
[24:17] thought you've put on my heart Lord and
[24:19] it's been such a revelation to me Lord
[24:21] and it's just so hard sometimes to show
[24:23] what you've shown to me Lord but I just
[24:25] pray through the power of your Holy
[24:26] Spirit Lord that you just come into the
[24:28] building tonight Lord and just yea your
[24:31] holy presence would be felt among us
[24:33] Lord and we could say that you
[24:35] they're now Matt's law we just pray a
[24:37] blessing of your word lord in jesus name
[24:40] amen you can be seated but while you're
[24:44] there we'll drop down to verse 34 all
[24:50] these things spake Jesus unto the
[24:53] multitude and parables and without a
[24:56] parable spake he not unto them that it
[24:58] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[25:01] the Prophet saying I will open my mouth
[25:03] in parables I will utter things which
[25:06] have been kept secret from the
[25:07] foundation of the world
[25:08] so Jesus was speaking in parables and
[25:14] hopefully with the Lord's help tonight
[25:16] on a show you some things that are
[25:18] hidden in the scripture and not clearly
[25:20] stated but yet we can see them and I you
[25:25] know how a st. Anna Dean after Sunday
[25:26] morning service and brother Isaac was
[25:28] saying you know I'm just the the spear
[25:31] toy you know not even a proper tire but
[25:33] that little yellow one that little space
[25:34] saver and he's who were driving off
[25:37] around the corner and we turned down the
[25:38] side street and lo and behold was a car
[25:40] sitting there with the yellow space
[25:42] saver wheel on and I turned to Nadine
[25:44] and I said you know that's brother Isaac
[25:46] you know I sit on one of those little
[25:48] three wheeler cars you know that goes
[25:50] around a corner and it tips over we just
[25:55] we're here we're here for the Lord you
[25:58] know we we're here to share what he's
[26:00] put on our heart and I was just hearing
[26:05] the testimonies that have come back from
[26:07] the convention and walk London brother
[26:09] Andy sharing some of the things and the
[26:11] the fire that was there and I was just
[26:13] thinking as I was coming here you know
[26:15] that time brother Brennan was fishing in
[26:17] the river and he was fishing for that
[26:19] rainbow trout because his whole ministry
[26:20] was to catch that rainbow trout to catch
[26:22] that bride that there's covenant and
[26:25] after he's finished as fishing he comes
[26:28] back to his tent and is a beer and their
[26:30] two Cubs and the Cubs have got into his
[26:32] stuff and they're tearing all of burden
[26:34] and he sees he's seen the mother bear go
[26:37] running off she was scared but the
[26:40] little cub stayed and he was wondering
[26:42] why this little cub was staying in there
[26:44] and he got a bit closer and he could see
[26:45] the little cub was Anna and the honey
[26:47] jar
[26:48] and I thought man this is you know we've
[26:51] had some congregation that have had
[26:53] their hands and the honey jar and when
[26:56] that little bear went running back to
[26:57] mama the mummer and the other cub were
[26:59] licking all that honey off so we just
[27:02] want to lick some of your fire while
[27:04] it's still hot and learning I mean you
[27:08] know I believe we're living in a harvest
[27:09] time and if we're living in a harvest
[27:12] time then there has to be something to
[27:13] harvest is a fruit coming forth upon the
[27:16] earth and as you can see here in this
[27:18] picture of the tears among the wheat the
[27:21] tears can look a lot like the week you
[27:24] know when a big vessel comes up in the
[27:26] middle of a field that's ready to be
[27:28] harvested see it's a thistle and you
[27:30] know it's bad and you know I'm going to
[27:31] stay away from that as a thistle but
[27:33] sometimes the tears can be so much like
[27:36] the wheat that it's hard to discern
[27:37] between the tears and the weed but it
[27:41] has to come something forth the harvests
[27:43] and the days of truth of church age
[27:47] revivals our God is finished it's over
[27:50] this and there's no more there's no
[27:52] there's no more ministry there's no
[27:54] eighth messenger coming everything we
[27:57] have now is sitting here in seed form
[27:58] coming to fruit so what the Lord's grace
[28:07] will show some things that are maybe a
[28:10] bit deep in a bit just things our Lord
[28:14] have been showing me that I hope I can
[28:15] show forth so brother Branham talking
[28:18] and resume if ages where are those vast
[28:20] numbers that keep coming to revivals and
[28:23] answer opticals
[28:24] are not most of the nearly emotional and
[28:27] their approach or desirous of something
[28:29] physical rather than desiring that which
[28:31] is truly spiritual as this age not like
[28:35] the day which Noah entered the Ark and
[28:37] the door was shut but yet God tarried
[28:40] and judgment seven days no one was
[28:43] literally turned to God and those silent
[28:46] days so what I want to find out because
[28:49] brother Branham preached the message
[28:50] souls in prison now he was talking about
[28:53] these souls that are imprisoned now have
[28:55] no more chance to be converted and our
[28:58] brother Brennan saying when Noah went
[29:00] into the ark the door was shut
[29:02] and no one was literally turned to God
[29:05] and those silent days and what are those
[29:07] silent days because we know those silent
[29:10] days came in the seventh seal when there
[29:12] was silence in heaven so he sees here
[29:16] and the souls that are in prison now he
[29:18] had the seventh seal from us he wouldn't
[29:20] do it when the angel stood day by day
[29:22] telling it but then he wouldn't do it on
[29:25] that one said this silence and heaven no
[29:28] one knew that was the coming of the Lord
[29:30] so now he's telling you what was
[29:32] happening under that Silence of the
[29:34] seventh seal was the coming of the Lord
[29:36] and it's still it's still happening
[29:38] we're in the middle of it this is the
[29:40] coming of the Lord that he's talking
[29:42] about is this age not like the day which
[29:50] Noah entered the Ark and the door was
[29:52] shut but yet God tarried and judgment
[29:54] seven days no one was literally tuned to
[29:57] God in those silent days and he carries
[29:59] on and yet it is the harvest time so now
[30:03] he's placing it in this day in the
[30:05] harvest time and yet it's the harvest
[30:07] time then there must come upon the scene
[30:09] and this age those who will bring the
[30:11] wheat and the tears to maturity the
[30:14] tears are already maturing very fast
[30:16] under corrupt teachers who turn the
[30:19] people from the word but the we also
[30:22] must mature amen and we know that from
[30:28] Calvary there's been a tearing down of
[30:30] the bride
[30:30] Satan's torn down the bride with the
[30:32] four anointings of the full horse riders
[30:34] but there's been a restoration brother
[30:36] well Joe talked to like Joel talked
[30:39] about the the Parimal were in the
[30:43] locusts the cankerworm the caterpillar
[30:44] all coming down and eating that tree but
[30:47] yet the trees got to come back again
[30:49] it's gotta be restored to the original
[30:50] grain a little something here brother
[30:54] Brennan said oldest reader now it says
[30:56] God is going to restore the Lutheran age
[30:59] did not restore the church had started a
[31:02] Reformation the Weasley and age did not
[31:04] restore the Pentecostal age did not
[31:06] restore that God has to restore he can
[31:09] not deny his word this is not the
[31:11] resurrection of the church it's a
[31:13] restoration
[31:14] God will take the church
[31:16] back to Pentecost of the beginning so
[31:19] right what they had God is bringing back
[31:21] he's not raising up what they had but
[31:24] he's bringing this church into that
[31:27] condition we know justification made way
[31:32] for sanctification and the Insecta
[31:34] fication made way for the Baptist
[31:36] baptizing of the Holy Spirit but then
[31:38] when the seals were unloose the baptism
[31:41] of the Holy Spirit made way for the Holy
[31:42] Spirit himself so goddess has come and
[31:48] the prophets ministry right but that
[31:54] ministry has to be accepted because it
[31:56] has to be a first fruit of the offering
[31:58] whenever our field would come up and
[32:01] ripen and the grain would ripen they
[32:03] would bring forth the first fruit when
[32:05] that blade was right and would be given
[32:07] as an offering and it had to be accepted
[32:10] and brother Branham came with the
[32:13] ministry of restoration and opened the
[32:15] seals and he was accepted and now the
[32:18] bride is walking in that same vision he
[32:21] was just the firstfruits but every one
[32:23] of us has to come into their fullness
[32:24] and their grain and the head and be
[32:27] accepted accept this message Cain's
[32:30] offering was rejected and there's going
[32:33] to be people that do not bring the right
[32:35] offering in this day there's nothing in
[32:37] them to bring the right offering and now
[32:43] the tears have been bound in bundles
[32:45] ready to be burned because everything
[32:47] that's when a man dies he stays the same
[32:50] way he doesn't change after he dies when
[32:53] he dies he appears a sinner when he dies
[32:55] he's still a sinner when he's brought up
[32:57] in the general resurrection so they had
[33:03] that bride has to accept mercy and also
[33:07] the tears have to reject mercy and to
[33:15] her God is sending the prophet messenger
[33:17] with a vindicated ministry that he might
[33:19] be accepted by the elect they will hear
[33:22] him as the first church heard Paul and
[33:24] she will mature and the word until
[33:27] becoming a word bride the mighty works
[33:29] will be fair
[33:30] that are always attendant upon the pure
[33:33] word and faith so the maturing of the
[33:36] bride is going to bring back the book of
[33:38] Acts it's going to bring back a power in
[33:40] the church you know this is something
[33:49] more for this bride to obtain there's
[33:52] something more you know there's a
[33:54] greater works for this bride to obtain
[33:56] and how can the bride do a greater works
[33:59] than what Jesus did how can the bride do
[34:02] that the voices and the bride and it was
[34:05] a loud voice that called Lazarus from
[34:07] the grave and I believe it'll be a loud
[34:10] voice that calls the bride of all the
[34:12] ages back to life again when the sons of
[34:15] God shouted for joy you know we look at
[34:17] something that's going on in the
[34:18] heavenly realm the sons of God shouted
[34:20] for joy and we place it oh that was like
[34:22] 7,000 years ago but realistically that's
[34:25] an eternity the sons of God are shouting
[34:28] for joy now they were shouting for joy
[34:30] and Abraham's day there were sons of God
[34:32] shouting for joy on the day of Pentecost
[34:34] and the sons of God are still shouting
[34:36] for joy and I believe that the shouting
[34:41] for joy when we can really come to the
[34:44] fullness of that vision man those did
[34:46] Saints you can go there's a party that
[34:48] I've got an appointment at and I want to
[34:51] be there
[34:57] Ezekiel 37 verse 3 I'll just read it to
[35:00] you and he said unto me son of man can
[35:02] these bones live and I answered Oh Lord
[35:05] God thou knowest again he said unto me
[35:08] prophesy upon these bones and say unto
[35:10] them oh ye dry bones hear the word of
[35:12] the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto
[35:15] these bones behold I will cause breath
[35:17] to enter unto you and ye shall live this
[35:22] is the prophet speaking this is not God
[35:25] speaking to the dry bones camel itis God
[35:27] through a body speaking to the bones I
[35:31] believe this is the power that's lying
[35:33] within the bride and how are we going to
[35:37] do these greater works then of Christ
[35:39] you know
[35:41] Jesus what Jesus talk of fish any break
[35:46] of fish and made more fish he took a
[35:48] loaf of bread and he broke a loaf of
[35:49] bread and made more bread but a profit
[35:53] that was accepted
[35:55] he spoke squirrels into existence where
[35:59] there were no squirrels this bride is
[36:02] coming forth with a spoken word to speak
[36:05] things into existence you know I was
[36:07] just reading a quote before before we
[36:10] came here and brother Brennan was saying
[36:12] I might touch it laid over these laws
[36:15] that are stopping the bride right now
[36:17] from just speaking a new world into
[36:19] existence and living on it there has to
[36:21] be something because it has to be a
[36:22] manifestation of the word here to preach
[36:24] to the souls that are in prison but the
[36:28] power that is in the bracket we could
[36:30] just speak another word because we have
[36:32] that power and there's going to come a
[36:34] time where that can be used and its
[36:35] fullness this is coming into maturity
[36:39] and it's a squeeze that will really
[36:41] bring this third pole into full
[36:43] operation you know we have a third pole
[36:45] now there's many things happening under
[36:48] it but we have it now but as a squeeze
[36:50] comes on really you know when you
[36:52] squeeze an orange and the juice comes
[36:55] out of it but you know it just squeezes
[36:58] the best part out all the flavor or the
[37:00] taste or the sugar you know the squeeze
[37:03] is bringing the best out of the bride
[37:06] you know what drove the Easter to come
[37:09] before the King took the squeeze on her
[37:13] people you know the priests coming on
[37:15] her people and she said you know we need
[37:18] a pray we need to have a prayer meeting
[37:20] you know because God can be touched and
[37:24] you have to reach out and touch them but
[37:26] that squeeze was bringing her and we're
[37:29] before it was death to come into that
[37:31] presence beyond the veil now Easter can
[37:33] go into the presence and she had one
[37:38] thing on her mind she had the salvation
[37:41] of her people on her mine but also the
[37:44] destruction of Haman and then because
[37:47] she could have had up to half the
[37:49] kingdom right then but she didn't want a
[37:51] selfish motive she wanted to see her
[37:52] people say and she wanted to see him and
[37:55] defeated you know I was just thinking on
[38:00] my way home Moses as well you know
[38:04] there's been a call in Egypt that
[38:06] there's going to be death over the land
[38:07] because we're living in an age where
[38:09] there we're rejecting the blood token
[38:13] rejecting the message for this age
[38:14] brings death and so an Egypt when they
[38:17] rejected that token striking the blood
[38:21] on the doorpost when it was rejected at
[38:24] bought a spiritual death what bought a
[38:26] natural death there but and type at what
[38:28] a spiritual death and a people come out
[38:30] and now they're racing to the Red Sea
[38:34] and the armies up behind them and Moses
[38:37] gets to the Red Sea and what are we
[38:39] going to do this army is going to
[38:40] destroy us but now as the squeeze is
[38:45] coming on and pressing unto Moses the
[38:47] waters part before them and miracles
[38:50] start happening as a squeeze is coming
[38:52] on and Moses says let's go through the
[38:54] water they go through the water and in
[38:56] the same time that squeeze is coming on
[38:58] and the bride's going through and to
[39:00] salvation the waters closing and kill
[39:02] the enemy and it's a squeeze that's
[39:05] bringing it on the revelation of Jesus
[39:12] Christ now remember this Christ and the
[39:15] true church as a continuation of the
[39:17] book of Acts but the book of Revelation
[39:21] shows how that the Antichrist spirit
[39:23] would come into the church and defile it
[39:25] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[39:28] it exposes Satan revealing his works
[39:31] attempted destruction of God's people
[39:34] and the discrediting of God's Word
[39:35] that's what Haman was doing was discreet
[39:38] at in God's people right down to the
[39:40] time he has cast into the lake of fire
[39:42] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[39:46] knows that if the people get the true
[39:48] revelation of the true church and what
[39:51] she is and what she stands for that she
[39:54] can do the greater works she will be an
[39:58] invincible army if they get a true
[40:01] revelation this is what I really wanted
[40:03] us focus I love this quote a son of my
[40:05] favorites but that's thought here if
[40:07] they get a true
[40:09] relation of the two spirits within the
[40:11] framework of the Christian Church and by
[40:13] God's Spirit discern and withstand the
[40:16] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[40:18] powerless before her so it comes from a
[40:20] revelation of those two spirits that
[40:22] have right from the Garden of Eden the
[40:24] seed chapter of Genesis coming up
[40:26] through the Bible that's brother Branham
[40:28] caught up the trail of the serpent
[40:29] coming up the twins of two vines the
[40:31] whole way to have a true revelation of
[40:33] that and to stand against at this day
[40:36] and Satan will be powerless before you
[40:39] he will be as definitely thought of
[40:42] today as when Christ withstood has every
[40:44] effort to gain power over him in the
[40:46] desert yes Satan hates revelation but we
[40:49] love it with true revelation in our
[40:52] lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[40:54] against us but we will prevail over them
[40:57] hallelujah amen there is a true
[41:02] revelation to be had here it's God's
[41:05] seed in the Serpent's seed that's so
[41:08] close I remember those the tares and the
[41:10] wheat so close that it would deceive the
[41:12] very elect if possible but it's not
[41:15] possible hallelu we need to make this
[41:19] church an uncomfortable place for the
[41:21] tears you make you make this place
[41:25] uncomfortable for the tears and this
[41:27] church will have just power Satan
[41:33] doesn't like it when you shout like you
[41:36] did with the sons of God back with Jobe
[41:39] he doesn't like it when you dance like
[41:41] David dance he doesn't like it when you
[41:44] pray like Hannah prayed for revival
[41:47] he doesn't like it when you take your
[41:50] Mountain like Deborah took her Mountain
[41:52] he's powerless where the true Cedars
[41:58] there's a continuation of the book of
[41:59] Acts the bride now continues the
[42:03] ministry of Christ
[42:05] completing the things that he could not
[42:07] do in his earthly ministry because there
[42:08] were some things that Jesus left to be
[42:10] done in this day and this time Jesus
[42:15] sowed the seed and it has to come to
[42:16] maturity but the devil also sowed her
[42:19] seed and now there has to come someone
[42:22] to bring
[42:23] for the maturing maturing of both the
[42:26] weight and the tears and there's a
[42:27] ministry here today that's bringing
[42:28] forth the maturing of the week and hell
[42:32] is spilling over from the sixth
[42:34] dimension of and the fifth dimension and
[42:36] to this dimension through TV through
[42:39] sound waves through Hollywood through
[42:41] all this and it's bringing forth four
[42:43] tears as all as all the sinner and it's
[42:47] just manifesting on earth as this age
[42:53] not like the day in which Noah entered
[42:55] the Ark and the door was shut but yet
[42:58] God tarried in judgment seven days no
[43:01] one was literally tuned to God and those
[43:03] silent days and yet it as the harvest
[43:05] then there must come upon the scene and
[43:07] this age those who will bring the wheat
[43:09] and tears to maturity so what happens in
[43:12] this day what's actually taking place
[43:16] because something's taking place now
[43:18] that we have to catch a revelation of
[43:21] and what we see as and the Garden of
[43:25] Eden God had given him this title deed
[43:29] to the earth so Adam had the power over
[43:32] the earth and then when the Sun came in
[43:35] he lost that title deed and it went back
[43:38] to God the original owner and and this
[43:40] see this is the but this was the whole
[43:42] title deed to everything that Jesus had
[43:45] possession of and our names were in that
[43:48] book and then at Calvary when Jesus died
[43:50] he took back that book it was the book
[43:53] of redemption and he had the book of
[43:55] redemption and you were redeemed at
[43:56] Calvary and then you weren't redeemed
[43:58] when you accepted this means that you
[44:00] were redeemed at Calvary and Jesus had
[44:02] that book and it was the book of
[44:04] redemption he took it out of the hand of
[44:06] God and that book could have been opened
[44:09] in but Christ sealed it up in mystery
[44:11] and parables everything was there your
[44:14] name was there but it had to wait until
[44:16] this time because now in this age a
[44:18] prophets reach forth and taken the book
[44:21] out of the land
[44:22] and now the prophets opened the book and
[44:25] is calling the names and your names in
[44:28] that book and so when this has taken
[44:30] place now he's only calling the names
[44:33] that are in the book no one was
[44:35] literally turned to God and no and
[44:36] silent days because Christ he had
[44:39] already redeemed you but now he was
[44:41] coming to receive you and he you know
[44:45] there's people that can just not accept
[44:46] the message because the their name
[44:49] wasn't in the book sometimes I found us
[44:59] going through some of the things as
[45:01] brother Brennan's preaching towards the
[45:02] end of the ministry as has revelation
[45:05] and as understanding as growing even as
[45:07] he's preaching the message and he
[45:08] recognizes us and he recognizes that and
[45:11] then he puts this on us together and
[45:13] it's continually growing in for me the
[45:16] revelation coming to me it's been the
[45:18] same that's come back why that because
[45:20] what's taking place today you can't go
[45:22] and just read well this verse here
[45:25] Caesar and this is this is it and and
[45:27] this is the instruction and I'll take
[45:29] this quote and it's Caesar because it's
[45:31] a mystery it has to be revealed to you
[45:33] watch him there'll be a lot of
[45:35] impersonating a lot of everything else
[45:37] but there was really somebody was going
[45:40] to be saved for he the church was
[45:42] predestinated to be without spot or
[45:44] wrinkle she is going to be there and the
[45:46] lamb died for that purpose and then when
[45:49] the last name on that book was redeemed
[45:51] the land came forth and took the book
[45:53] and then he makes a statement and you
[45:56] can go and listen to it and he says I'm
[45:57] the one that did that so now he's saying
[45:59] it's the land because it was Christ and
[46:01] the Prophet that reaches out and take
[46:03] the takes the book and he says I'm the
[46:06] one that did that I'm the one that took
[46:08] the book and I believe as he's going
[46:12] through here here in this river he
[46:14] starts making it a bit clearer as he
[46:16] goes through I believe he was inspired
[46:20] to say that you know you were not
[46:26] redeemed just by the opening of this
[46:29] book you had to be redeemed back at
[46:31] Calvary but now he's coming to receive
[46:33] because his first coming was to redeem
[46:35] the bride has seeking coming is to
[46:37] receive the bride that's as the secret
[46:40] coming the rapture were in the rapture
[46:42] now and as third coming as certainly
[46:44] comes back with us bro
[46:46] and that's why the church today misses
[46:47] it because they only see two comings of
[46:50] the law
[46:50] and they mess what's taking place in the
[46:53] mystery and I'm glad that I heard him
[46:57] call my name out of that book I mean
[47:00] because there was a seed here and as
[47:03] soon as that light struck upon that see
[47:06] that started to grow that plant up until
[47:09] it and now it's just maturing and it's
[47:10] hid then the land came forth for what he
[47:15] had redeemed he come to claim what he
[47:17] had redeemed he already got it right
[47:19] here in the book taken from his hand now
[47:22] he's coming to receive what he had
[47:24] redeemed that's his work he's done he's
[47:26] come to receive it oh what a time has
[47:29] proven it the Seventh Seal proved it
[47:31] come back and took the book of
[47:33] Redemption notice it was to be the
[47:36] seventh angels message that it was to
[47:37] reveal the seventh the seven seals
[47:39] revelation ten seven now you find it so
[47:42] now he's tying this whole event and to
[47:44] Revelation 10 seven that he's tying this
[47:47] whole event and to what's taking place
[47:49] in this day the Lamb has come forth with
[47:54] an open book to receive us and the bride
[47:57] is coming to life one at one the bride
[47:59] does not all come and to life and one go
[48:02] that's an individual fear that you have
[48:05] with Christ a relationship with you head
[48:07] and not everyone's at the same stage and
[48:14] when this took place when Christ come
[48:17] and unsealed this book and a bride
[48:19] started to live upon the earth and the
[48:22] fullness of this vision with Christ and
[48:24] here Christ become on full display again
[48:27] and the body of his bride up until this
[48:31] time the word had only been on a partial
[48:32] display you know there were minister
[48:35] there were Reformation they had a part a
[48:37] part of this word but it wasn't the full
[48:39] word it was just a part and God had him
[48:43] he had ignorant for son and not
[48:47] accepting the fullness of the word like
[48:48] I think the Lutheran's thought the Jews
[48:50] were the Anti Christ right so there was
[48:52] an ignorant there for not accepting well
[48:56] not knowing the fullness of the word
[48:58] because they were doing things under
[49:01] justification that weren't may be holy
[49:03] and
[49:04] they come into sanctification and they
[49:06] didn't walk in the spirit you know so
[49:08] Christ had a the high priest would go
[49:11] and make an offering for the ignorance
[49:13] of sins but they had to come a time when
[49:16] Christ would come and be on full display
[49:18] and now it's mercy or judgment because
[49:22] he's provided a way of nurse
[49:23] he's always provided a way of mercy but
[49:26] to not accept that provide a place of
[49:28] Mercy as judgment so when the children
[49:31] of Israel were walking through the
[49:32] desert and they were getting burdened by
[49:34] serpents they were getting burdened
[49:36] because they were doing wrong but God
[49:37] provided a place of mercy when the
[49:40] startle they had to look to that serpent
[49:43] on the pole and if they would look to it
[49:45] God would spear them but if they didn't
[49:47] look to her if they didn't look to that
[49:48] sacrifice they wouldn't be safe he
[49:50] always makes a way of mercy and judgment
[49:52] but it has to be accepted this is why
[49:59] brother Branham preached the indictment
[50:01] to call the church to a trial and indict
[50:03] them for the seeking crucifixion of
[50:04] Christ because they had to had to be a
[50:08] time where they would come forth and
[50:09] ministry that would preach to the total
[50:11] loss that had no chance of mercy but
[50:14] would be guilty of the second
[50:16] crucifixion of Christ because it
[50:18] happened in Jesus ministry and brother
[50:20] Branham says we have exactly the same
[50:22] Ministry of Christ and there has to be a
[50:24] people upon the earth manifesting that a
[50:27] loss they can't be saved they don't have
[50:29] a seed they're to be saved and I'm going
[50:34] to bring forth a balance because the
[50:36] bride as a place of mercy that can be
[50:38] touched and hopefully we'll get there
[50:42] and I can show you that but you can't
[50:46] kill the ministry it lives on you can
[50:48] put the messenger to sleep but you can't
[50:50] put the message AHA right he lived on
[50:53] and notice when the third pull of his
[50:56] ministry come first was healing the sick
[50:58] the second was rebuking the
[51:00] organization's and prophesying what they
[51:02] had done what they were and what was
[51:05] coming what is what will come and what
[51:07] was what is and what will come that's
[51:09] what he done is that right
[51:11] but his third pole was when he preached
[51:14] to the Lost that couldn't be saved no
[51:16] more they were down there
[51:18] with in big painted eyes was preached to
[51:22] the souls and how that did not accept
[51:25] mercy but were eternally separated from
[51:27] the presence of God but yet they had to
[51:30] recognize that what he was because God
[51:33] made him death one day of his ministry
[51:36] climbs out the same way in the last days
[51:38] as it was as the father sent me so send
[51:41] I you that works that I do shall you
[51:45] also lost could never be saved they had
[51:48] rejected mercy that was as they're poor
[51:51] and do you believe that third Paul's
[51:54] here and then because that third Paul
[51:57] has come to do more than one thing it
[51:59] first come brother branham's of these
[52:01] three parts to the third Pope he said
[52:03] the spoken word the opening of the word
[52:06] and preaching to the Lost and everything
[52:08] that's happening in the ministry and
[52:09] this time is happening under one of
[52:11] those three things jesus said many will
[52:16] come to me in that day and say I have
[52:18] done all these things see they eat manna
[52:20] and the wilderness
[52:21] jesus said they everyone eternally
[52:24] separated they did that's eternally gone
[52:26] they perished right there in the
[52:28] wilderness
[52:28] you remember Hebrews a six chapter ones
[52:31] that was once made known the truth and
[52:33] refused to walk in it there is no more
[52:36] repentance for them see borderline
[52:38] belief when the truth is presented to a
[52:41] person for the last time and they refuse
[52:43] to receive it according to the book of
[52:45] Hebrews see they will there's not even
[52:48] anything in the world that can either
[52:50] save them but there's many that will
[52:53] come to him in that day and say haven't
[52:55] we done these things they have finished
[52:58] no repentance no redemption there is
[53:01] nothing left for them they are eternally
[53:02] separated the Bible said so looking for
[53:05] the fearful fire indignation which shall
[53:07] devour their adversary and when the
[53:10] truth of this gospel has been proven
[53:12] thoroughly vindicated and then turn
[53:14] around and walk from it they're finished
[53:16] that's all that's awful
[53:17] that is awful it's awful but I have to
[53:21] say and somebody has to say it because
[53:23] it's a truth laying here in the Bible
[53:25] and I don't want to see somebody it and
[53:27] have no chance of mercy I'm sure you
[53:29] don't turf the love of God's on you but
[53:31] but
[53:32] factors there are people that cannot
[53:33] accept the message but they have to hear
[53:35] the gospel they have to reject it they
[53:37] have to manifest this what they did when
[53:40] Satan told a lie in heaven and they
[53:42] rejected it and now it's just
[53:44] manifesting upon the earth
[53:47] remember the angels which kept not their
[53:49] first to stay but leaf there in that
[53:52] prison house and darkness where the
[53:53] world is walking today and that same
[53:55] prison there is no more repentance there
[53:58] is no repentance brother Branham had
[54:01] that vision of walking through JC Penney
[54:03] store you remember and he's seen their
[54:05] green eyes and he he had a vision when
[54:08] he was a boy of going to hell and it
[54:11] shocked him because he's seen what was
[54:13] taking place around him and he said this
[54:15] is how this is what I seen when I went
[54:17] to hell that's manifesting she I seen
[54:20] that there that woman walking around and
[54:22] how and he began to realize that the
[54:25] tears were coming to fruit and you know
[54:32] brother Branham when he was preaching I
[54:35] think the sixth seal sixth seal he
[54:38] talked us back into Matthew Matthew 24
[54:41] and he showed you the first six seals
[54:43] right the way through Matthew chapter 24
[54:46] showing that it was revealed but had an
[54:49] Anna mystery but it's there everything's
[54:50] here in the word but then brother
[54:52] Branham sees Betty and meted the Seventh
[54:54] Seal we didn't say nothing about it and
[54:58] we know that he was revealing it but in
[55:02] parables as we read at the start and to
[55:04] the bride he's revealing in parables so
[55:06] he revealed the sex in Matthew 24 and
[55:09] then you go over into Matthew 25 and I
[55:11] might get a turn there Matthew 25
[55:14] because now he's going to show you the
[55:16] Seventh Seal and Matthew 25 the whole
[55:19] chapter as a sealant seal
[55:35] being shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[55:37] likened unto ten virgins which took
[55:40] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[55:42] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[55:44] and five were foolish and that were
[55:47] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[55:49] with them but the wise took oil in their
[55:52] vessels with their lamps and while the
[55:54] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[55:56] and slept and at midnight there was a
[55:59] cry mean I believe this is the midnight
[56:00] hour and there has been a cry made
[56:02] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[56:06] to meet him it's in there what happened
[56:08] the Eliezer called then all those
[56:12] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
[56:14] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[56:17] us of your oil for our lamps had gone
[56:19] out but the wise answered saying not so
[56:21] lest there be not enough for us in you
[56:23] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[56:27] buy for yourselves and we see now that
[56:29] the churches are all going out and that
[56:32] they want revival they want the gifts
[56:34] they want prophecy they want all these
[56:36] things they're hungry but they can't
[56:38] obtain it they don't have the revelation
[56:41] they don't have the oil and while they
[56:45] went to buy the bridegroom came and they
[56:48] that were really went and with him to
[56:50] the marriage and the door was shut now I
[56:52] don't believe that we're going to a
[56:54] marriage brother Brennan has already
[56:55] clearly said that we go to the wedding
[56:57] supper not the marriage the marriage is
[56:59] taking place now under that tent vision
[57:01] that brother Brennan had under the food
[57:03] pour 'this ministry were uniting to
[57:05] Christ after word came also the other
[57:09] virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but
[57:12] he answered and said verily I say unto
[57:14] you I know you not watch therefore for
[57:17] you know neither the day nor the hour
[57:19] when the Son of man cometh
[57:21] the Lambs come forth to receive his
[57:24] bride and then the door shut because
[57:29] he's now just coming for his bride
[57:30] coming for the names that are on the
[57:32] book because the you know the church was
[57:35] the ones that shut the door Christ was
[57:36] on the outside he said I'm knocking and
[57:39] if you open I'll come in and sup but if
[57:41] this nothing within you to open the door
[57:43] you can't receive it in Christ can't
[57:45] come in so they shut the door
[57:48] and there's a marriage taking place now
[57:51] uniting with the groom so the groom can
[57:54] finish this work throw his bride you
[57:57] know Christ is amazed at his bride he's
[57:59] not looking at the bridesmaid
[58:01] I mean he's not definitely not looking
[58:03] at the best man he's just looking at the
[58:06] bride cuz that's as focused as whole
[58:08] focus as honors bride the bride and you
[58:12] know the bridesmaid has no part in the
[58:14] honeymoon because we're going on a
[58:16] honeymoon soon you know brother Brennan
[58:18] said that when we go to this marriage
[58:21] supper you know this is our honeymoon
[58:22] right through the Millennium were on a
[58:24] honeymoon period and the bridesmaid has
[58:28] no part in that he's receiving his bride
[58:32] and the fullest church is trying to buy
[58:34] oil thinking she has been saved but she
[58:37] is rejected mercy and is eternally lost
[58:39] and guilty for the seeking crucifixion
[58:41] of Christ when the father said open unto
[58:45] us he said unto he said I know you not I
[58:48] know you're not so Matthew verse 14
[58:55] because we're going to carry on for the
[58:59] kingdom of heaven as as as a man
[59:01] travelling into a far country who called
[59:04] his servants and delivered unto them his
[59:06] goods and unto every one he gave unto
[59:10] one he gave five talents to another two
[59:13] and to another one to every man
[59:15] according to his several ability and
[59:18] straightway took his journey so you know
[59:20] Christ has come to you and he's given
[59:23] you a portion and some people didn't you
[59:27] know lay there might be one brother and
[59:29] here's an amazing ministry in Christ
[59:31] that's given in this great portion and
[59:33] then to another brother he's given a
[59:35] small portion but God's all carry on
[59:39] reading it then they that had received
[59:42] the five talents went and traded with
[59:44] the same and made them other five
[59:45] talents likewise he that had received
[59:48] two he also gained two but he that had
[59:52] won went and digged in the earth and had
[59:54] his Lords money don't hide it under a
[59:56] bushel
[59:58] so now in this parable we see the groom
[1:00:02] comes with this book it's been
[1:00:03] vindicated among us and he's left back
[1:00:05] gifts with the bride some he's left a
[1:00:08] greater portion than others but he only
[1:00:11] requires of you what he's given you but
[1:00:14] you have to do something with what he's
[1:00:16] given you if he's given you a great
[1:00:18] portion then you need to do something
[1:00:20] with that don't hide it under a bushel
[1:00:21] because it'll be required at your hand
[1:00:24] verse 19 after a long time the Lord of
[1:00:28] those servants come and Rickon with them
[1:00:30] and so he that had received five talents
[1:00:33] came and brought other five talents
[1:00:34] saying Lord thou delivers us unto me
[1:00:37] five talents behold I have gained the
[1:00:39] sight than five talents more his Lord
[1:00:41] said unto him well done thou good and
[1:00:43] faithful servant thou have been faithful
[1:00:45] over a few things I will make thee ruler
[1:00:47] over many things into thou unto the joy
[1:00:49] of the Lord he also that had received
[1:00:53] two talents came and said Lord thou
[1:00:55] delivered to me two talents behold I
[1:00:57] have gained two other talents beside
[1:01:00] them
[1:01:00] he's Lord said unto him well done good
[1:01:02] and faithful servant thou has been
[1:01:04] faithful over a few things I will make
[1:01:06] thee ruler over many things in two thou
[1:01:08] into the joy of the Lord you're only
[1:01:11] required to do what he's given to you
[1:01:13] but to every member of the bride he has
[1:01:15] given you a commission to do something
[1:01:17] to reprocess I this book to flesh out
[1:01:19] this word to love it and he is going to
[1:01:22] require of you to do that portion of the
[1:01:24] word verse 24 then he which had received
[1:01:29] one talent came and said lord I knew
[1:01:31] that thou art a hard man reaping where
[1:01:33] thou has not sown and gathering without
[1:01:35] was not straw and I was afraid and went
[1:01:37] and had thy talent in the earth lo there
[1:01:40] thou hast us that is thine as Lord
[1:01:43] answered and said unto Him thou knew I
[1:01:45] was a wicked and slothful servant thou
[1:01:47] knewest that i reap where I sowed not
[1:01:49] and gather where I am not strong
[1:01:51] there ought us to have put my money to
[1:01:53] the exchangers and then at my coming I
[1:01:55] should have received my own with the
[1:01:56] Azzurri
[1:01:57] take therefore the talent from him and
[1:01:59] give it unto him which hath ten talents
[1:02:01] but unto every one that hath shall be
[1:02:04] given and he shall have an abundance but
[1:02:07] from him that hath not shall be taken
[1:02:09] away even that which he hath
[1:02:11] and cassia the unprofitable servant into
[1:02:14] outer darkness there shall be weeping
[1:02:15] and gnashing of teeth
[1:02:17] that's quite serious what the Lord's
[1:02:20] calling a ministry and the bride to do
[1:02:23] my whole drive at the moment with what
[1:02:26] the Lord has been showing me is to show
[1:02:28] the bride that she has a work to do you
[1:02:33] know you can't just stay at home and
[1:02:37] listen to tapes and be a I'm tape
[1:02:40] ministry or you know I belong to this
[1:02:42] church over an America or China or
[1:02:46] wherever it is and and and just build
[1:02:49] your own Little Kingdom at home and
[1:02:51] you've got this comfy little tent that
[1:02:53] you dwell under because you're not
[1:02:55] fulfilling the Word of God because there
[1:02:58] are people now that have no seed in them
[1:03:00] to accept this message but yet they have
[1:03:02] to this word has to be displayed before
[1:03:06] them and rejected because they can you
[1:03:10] know Jesus is a just judge and no one
[1:03:12] can be judged if they haven't heard the
[1:03:14] truth you know right verse 31 and I want
[1:03:21] you to see yourself in the sphere when
[1:03:23] the Son of man cometh and has glory and
[1:03:27] all the holy angels with him then shall
[1:03:29] he sit upon the throne of his glory
[1:03:31] because he's coming and the great white
[1:03:35] throne judgment with his glory and
[1:03:36] that's his bride the bride is the glory
[1:03:39] of Christ and now he's going to come and
[1:03:40] sit upon his throne of glory because the
[1:03:43] bride is sitting with Christ on that
[1:03:45] judgment see just as Easter was sitting
[1:03:48] on the seat with the king being able to
[1:03:51] write out the decree verse 32 and before
[1:03:57] him shall be gathered all nations and he
[1:04:00] shall separate them one from another as
[1:04:02] a shepherd divided his sheep from the
[1:04:04] goats and he shall set the sheep up on
[1:04:07] his right hand but the goats on the left
[1:04:09] then shall the King say unto them on his
[1:04:11] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[1:04:13] and here at the kingdom prepared for you
[1:04:16] from the foundation of the world for I
[1:04:19] was hungry and he gave me me I was
[1:04:22] thirsty and you gave me drink
[1:04:23] I was a stranger and you took
[1:04:25] in naked and you clothed me I was sick
[1:04:28] and you visited me I was in prison and
[1:04:31] he came unto me then shall the righteous
[1:04:33] answer him saying Lord when saw we thee
[1:04:36] a hunger tore feed thee or thirsty and
[1:04:38] gave thee drink when saw we thee a
[1:04:40] stranger and took the end or naked and
[1:04:43] clothed thee or when saw we sick or in
[1:04:45] prison and came unto thee in the King
[1:04:48] show answer and say unto them verily I
[1:04:51] say unto you and as much as you have
[1:04:53] done it unto one of the least of my
[1:04:55] brethren ye have done it unto me so you
[1:04:58] can see that you walking in the fullness
[1:05:00] of this word upon earth you are a place
[1:05:03] that can be touched
[1:05:04] you're a mercy place but there's some
[1:05:07] important things in here too because
[1:05:11] there's a quote in the church age book
[1:05:13] that brother Brennan talks about this
[1:05:15] and he really drives us home that
[1:05:17] there's going to be people that will
[1:05:19] receive eternal life because of the way
[1:05:21] they treated the bride but then with a
[1:05:23] further study you find brother Brennan
[1:05:25] he also goes and he shows that he says
[1:05:27] you can not be both a sheep and a goat a
[1:05:30] sheep as a sheep it has a nature of a
[1:05:32] sheep and a goat as a go as a nature of
[1:05:34] a goat so just because a wicked sinner
[1:05:38] comes and does one good act to you and
[1:05:41] then carries on a life of sin he's a
[1:05:44] goat he's a goat
[1:05:46] maybe I hope it may account for him in
[1:05:49] some way but from what I can see in the
[1:05:51] word it doesn't but there are of people
[1:05:53] that love God they want to serve God
[1:05:55] they can't fully accept this word it
[1:05:58] wasn't given to them to be bribed but
[1:06:00] they loved the people that they loved
[1:06:01] Christian you know you've met those
[1:06:03] people I'm sure they love you and they
[1:06:05] want they they want to be around you
[1:06:06] they like your presence and they'll do
[1:06:08] anything they can for you but they just
[1:06:10] can't accept that word because they're a
[1:06:13] sheep has said there that the righteous
[1:06:17] it can't be a sheep and live like a goat
[1:06:20] but there is opportunity for people to
[1:06:23] reach out and touch you verse 41 then
[1:06:27] shall he say unto them on the left hand
[1:06:30] depart from me ye cursed into
[1:06:32] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[1:06:35] and his angels for I was hungered and he
[1:06:37] gave me no meat I was thirsty and he
[1:06:39] gave me no drink I was a stranger and
[1:06:41] you took me knocking naked and you
[1:06:43] clothed me not sick and in prison and
[1:06:46] you visited me not you see the people
[1:06:49] have to reject you they have to accept
[1:06:51] this message or reject it and you say
[1:06:54] well how are people going to receive
[1:06:55] life without the blood of Christ well
[1:06:58] where as all the blood where does all
[1:07:01] the blood belong with Christ's blood
[1:07:03] it's on the body my blood does not dwell
[1:07:05] on the outside of my body the blood is
[1:07:07] and the body and Christ as Anna's bright
[1:07:10] and this bride is manifesting Christ and
[1:07:13] all the blood of crisis and the bride so
[1:07:15] they might not have redemption to be
[1:07:17] bribed brother Branham said there
[1:07:18] they're not an inheritor of anything
[1:07:21] other than life they just inherit life
[1:07:23] but you have such an opportunity to be
[1:07:26] out there among the people and been
[1:07:29] touched we can't build our own Kingdom
[1:07:31] and then shall they also answer him
[1:07:35] saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered
[1:07:37] or athirst or a stranger and naked or
[1:07:39] sick or in prison and did not minister
[1:07:41] unto thee the in shall I answer saying
[1:07:43] and fairly I say unto you in as much as
[1:07:45] you did it not to one of the least of
[1:07:47] these he did it not to me and they shall
[1:07:50] go away into everlasting punishment but
[1:07:52] the righteous and to evil and to life
[1:07:54] eternal and look now unless they how the
[1:08:03] denominational churches the so-called
[1:08:05] Bride of Christ that the leaders are
[1:08:08] treating the bride this message is under
[1:08:12] persecution has been labeled extremism
[1:08:15] they're rejecting mercy because it's the
[1:08:19] false vine that's coming up so to keep
[1:08:25] in balance with what I'm trying to show
[1:08:26] when we say no one was literally tuned
[1:08:29] to God in those silent days he's come to
[1:08:31] receive his bride the names that are
[1:08:33] written on the book but yet there as a
[1:08:36] place of mercy just not for the bride
[1:08:38] he's the bride of the ones with the
[1:08:40] names on the book but I just really say
[1:08:44] love that life be approachable you know
[1:08:47] be someone that can be talked to and if
[1:08:50] they reject you which you know Jesus
[1:08:51] said
[1:08:52] shake the dust off the sole of your foot
[1:08:55] you know and move on don't well you can
[1:08:58] argue with people but I don't believe
[1:09:00] and having debates with the devil I mean
[1:09:02] we just we have the word we have a
[1:09:04] vision and we go forth with the word so
[1:09:10] that blood when Jesus come forth with
[1:09:13] the book the blood the Christ left the
[1:09:15] mercy see when he come forth with the
[1:09:17] book but the blood of Christ is still in
[1:09:20] the body and it's still approachable
[1:09:26] skip out a few notes sorry
[1:09:28] let's go and read Matthew 7:21 because I
[1:09:32] want to bring a couple more scriptures
[1:09:34] unto this
[1:09:50] Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith
[1:09:53] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:09:55] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:09:57] will of my father which is in heaven
[1:09:58] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:10:02] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:10:03] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:10:06] in thy name have done wonderful works
[1:10:08] and then will I profess unto them I
[1:10:10] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:10:12] work iniquity there forever so here if
[1:10:16] these sayings and wine and do with them
[1:10:17] I will liken him unto a wise man which
[1:10:20] built his house upon a rock upon the
[1:10:22] true revelation not everyone that says
[1:10:26] Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of
[1:10:29] heaven not even you know it says depart
[1:10:35] from me I don't know where they end up
[1:10:39] but these this is the church this is the
[1:10:42] church that have been prophesying in the
[1:10:44] name casting out Devils doing mighty
[1:10:46] works but they Jesus didn't even know
[1:10:50] them Luke 13 verse 23 then said one unto
[1:10:59] Him Lord are there few that be saved and
[1:11:03] he said unto them strive to enter in at
[1:11:07] the strait gate for many I say unto you
[1:11:10] will seek to enter in and shall not be
[1:11:12] able when once the master of the house
[1:11:15] has risen up and hath shut the door and
[1:11:17] began to stand without and to knock at
[1:11:20] the door saying Lord Lord open unto us
[1:11:22] and he shall answer and say unto you I
[1:11:25] know you not whence ye are then shall
[1:11:27] you begin to say we have eaten and
[1:11:30] drunken in thy presence and now has
[1:11:32] taught in our streets but he shall say I
[1:11:34] tell you I know you're not whence ER
[1:11:37] depart from me all ye workers of
[1:11:39] iniquity there shall be weeping and
[1:11:41] gnashing of teeth when you shall see
[1:11:43] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the
[1:11:45] prophets and the kingdom of God and you
[1:11:47] yourselves thrust out Christ is on the
[1:11:52] outside of this age and he's calling a
[1:11:55] bride to come out and meet him and unite
[1:11:58] with him but to the church to the
[1:12:01] seventh church age the door has been
[1:12:02] shut
[1:12:03] I just thinking upon this thought I was
[1:12:10] thinking you know the story of Rahab how
[1:12:13] did that prostitute that wasn't even it
[1:12:15] wasn't even in there and the the seed
[1:12:18] line how did she find mercy in the day
[1:12:20] of judgment it says now therefore I pray
[1:12:25] you swear unto me by the Lord since I
[1:12:28] have showed you kindness that ye will
[1:12:30] also show me kindness unto my father's
[1:12:32] house and give me a true token and
[1:12:37] dropping down a pit and the men answered
[1:12:40] her our life for your life every utter
[1:12:42] not the sour business and it shall be
[1:12:44] when the Lord hath given us the land
[1:12:46] that we will deal kindly and truly
[1:12:49] worthy she did a service and housing
[1:12:52] God's servants as they come into the
[1:12:54] land and now through that service she
[1:12:57] did when when we come into the land and
[1:13:01] there's a judgment coming
[1:13:02] we'll deal kindly and truly for their
[1:13:04] act that they did towards got a day off
[1:13:14] tomorrow don't we does that give me a
[1:13:16] bit of grace I wanted to look at the
[1:13:20] pool of Jesus ministry because there's a
[1:13:23] lot here that we can parallel because
[1:13:26] you know the bride each one of us you
[1:13:30] individually have to have a death to
[1:13:32] this flesh this flesh has to die it has
[1:13:35] to be crucified because to be remarried
[1:13:37] you can't remarry until they're old
[1:13:39] spouses did not divorce not put away
[1:13:42] God's original plan was there that must
[1:13:45] die and our flesh has to die out of our
[1:13:48] self and as Jesus was on the cross and
[1:13:51] his flesh died his spirit didn't die and
[1:13:54] has sold it and died but has just as
[1:13:58] flesh died on the cross and as they
[1:14:02] stabbed him in the side and the blood
[1:14:04] came forth and it was the bride coming
[1:14:06] forth out of her side and the first
[1:14:10] thing he does as he goes and he descends
[1:14:13] down into how to preach to the lost lost
[1:14:16] souls this is
[1:14:17] Jesus third pull of his ministry after
[1:14:20] he's died to the flesh after the bride
[1:14:23] has died to the flesh she has a third
[1:14:25] pull ministry to do he descends down to
[1:14:29] preach to the Lost and what I found
[1:14:35] interesting and this as Ernest these
[1:14:39] souls that are in prison are the ones
[1:14:42] that had rejected mercy up until Jesus
[1:14:45] day the ones that rejected Noah's
[1:14:46] message that rejected all the truth up
[1:14:49] until this point where Jesus was
[1:14:51] crucified their souls were in prison but
[1:14:53] Jesus hadn't been crucified year so he
[1:14:56] had to come and be seen by them and be
[1:14:59] and preached to them and they had
[1:15:03] already rejected the truth so they were
[1:15:05] lost but this is what the bride is
[1:15:07] having to do today there are people that
[1:15:09] are lost because they've already
[1:15:10] rejected the truth when they rejected it
[1:15:12] in heaven but now it's just manifesting
[1:15:15] and there was a gulf separated and this
[1:15:19] Old Testament and whether we're the Old
[1:15:23] Testament Saints where they were in a
[1:15:24] paradise right and there was a gulf
[1:15:26] where it said let Lazarus put forth his
[1:15:30] finger upon my tongue you know there was
[1:15:32] a gulf separating the souls and prison
[1:15:35] and this paradise and maybe I want to
[1:15:40] show it maybe another time and the
[1:15:42] dimension charts with brother Brendan
[1:15:43] breaks dimensions down into circles he
[1:15:45] says you draw a circle you draw another
[1:15:47] circle and the circle goes right around
[1:15:49] so now dimensions are going both ways so
[1:15:53] this is under the fifth dimension that
[1:15:55] this is taking place those souls are in
[1:15:57] prison and the fifth dimension and in
[1:15:59] that same dimension was the Old
[1:16:01] Testament paradise but there was a gulf
[1:16:03] that separated them now Jesus comes up
[1:16:06] from preaching to the Lost Souls than
[1:16:07] that fifth dimension and he takes those
[1:16:10] Old Testament Saints because now the
[1:16:11] Lambs been crucified and now he takes
[1:16:14] those souls up into the sixth dimension
[1:16:17] and he says the Old Testament paradise
[1:16:20] was done away was done away cuz now
[1:16:22] those Saints were in the sixth dimension
[1:16:23] he had taken them up and those
[1:16:25] dimensions continued and circles that's
[1:16:28] rather interesting
[1:16:30] so we preach to the souls that are in
[1:16:33] prison on this earth and at the same
[1:16:36] time we're also leading where the seed
[1:16:39] that's upon this earth bright that's
[1:16:41] upon this earth where re prophesying
[1:16:44] this word and seeing a bride come to
[1:16:46] life rise up we're calling a bride to
[1:16:48] come and rise up to a higher place right
[1:16:51] and then there's one more thing that was
[1:16:55] taking place in these three days that I
[1:16:57] thought was just amazing while we're
[1:17:01] preaching to the souls in prison why
[1:17:03] we're calling seed to come to life
[1:17:04] there's one more thing coming and taking
[1:17:07] place before the resurrection before
[1:17:12] this bride has resurrected this is all
[1:17:14] taking place right because Christ
[1:17:15] doesn't rise until that fair day Luke 24
[1:17:23] verse 13 and behold two of them were
[1:17:26] that went the same day to a village
[1:17:28] called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem
[1:17:30] about threescore furlongs
[1:17:32] and they talked together of all the
[1:17:34] things which had happened and it came to
[1:17:37] pass that while they commune together
[1:17:39] and reasoned Jesus himself drew near and
[1:17:42] went with them but their eyes were
[1:17:44] holding that they should not know him so
[1:17:47] this was taking place in these three
[1:17:48] days before the resurrection before
[1:17:51] Jesus our sins and he said unto them
[1:17:56] what manner of communications are these
[1:17:59] that you have one to another and walk
[1:18:01] and I said and one of them whose name
[1:18:04] was Cleophus answered and said unto Him
[1:18:06] art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem
[1:18:09] and has not known the things which had
[1:18:11] come to passed and these days you know
[1:18:15] there's no need to be sad we're loving
[1:18:18] in the happiest day sons of God shouting
[1:18:20] for joy there is no reason to be sad
[1:18:23] Jesus himself has drawn near but we
[1:18:27] trusted that it had been he which should
[1:18:29] have redeemed Israel and besides all
[1:18:32] this today is the third day since these
[1:18:34] things were done then he said unto them
[1:18:38] oh fall slow of heart to believe all the
[1:18:41] prophets have spoken or not Christ to
[1:18:43] have suffered
[1:18:44] these things in it to enter into his
[1:18:46] glory and beginning at Moses and all the
[1:18:48] prophets he expounded unto them and all
[1:18:51] the Scriptures the things concerning
[1:18:52] himself and that is what Christ is doing
[1:18:55] now in the third poll and this time
[1:18:58] right now be as a manifestation being
[1:19:01] shown that the loss would reject knew
[1:19:04] see his bride rising up fruit coming
[1:19:09] forth into manifestation and Jesus
[1:19:11] Christ Himself is walking with us and
[1:19:13] he's revealing this word through every
[1:19:16] shadow and type of the Bible any city's
[1:19:18] revealing it in parables because you
[1:19:21] cannot take the Bible and read the
[1:19:23] seventh seal because it's silent and
[1:19:24] shut up but yet it's an every every type
[1:19:27] and in the Bible that's that's fully
[1:19:31] revealed and he is here but you have to
[1:19:34] walk with him and you have to let him
[1:19:35] draw near to you and show you and they
[1:19:43] drew nigh unto the village whether they
[1:19:45] win and he made as though he would have
[1:19:47] gone further but they constrained him
[1:19:49] saying abide with us for it is toward
[1:19:52] evening and the day is far spent I
[1:19:54] believe that this is the evening time
[1:19:56] and the day is far far spent and he went
[1:20:01] to tarry and to tarry with them and it
[1:20:04] came to pass as he sat with meat at meet
[1:20:06] with them and he took bread and he
[1:20:08] blessed her and he break it and he gave
[1:20:10] it to them and behold their eyes were
[1:20:13] opened and they knew him and he vanished
[1:20:15] out of their sight so though you can't
[1:20:17] see the physical manifestation of
[1:20:19] nail-pierced hands and are stabbed in
[1:20:22] the side body that's not what we're
[1:20:25] looking for we're looking for the word
[1:20:26] made manifest and as Jesus began to take
[1:20:30] the bread the meat of the word and break
[1:20:32] it and show you when you begin to eat
[1:20:34] that and you begin to see your eyes
[1:20:36] become open and now you see Christ and
[1:20:38] you say Christ is here and people say
[1:20:40] you're nuts you're crazy you have gone
[1:20:41] off the rails but they can't see him
[1:20:43] because it's a personal revelation that
[1:20:46] he comes to you and he starts to begin
[1:20:49] and reveal this book and then your eyes
[1:20:51] become open and now I read the Bible and
[1:20:53] I go well you know I don't read a story
[1:20:56] about
[1:20:57] I thought Noah I read a story about
[1:20:59] Jesus Christ you know every story I'm
[1:21:02] reading it's not just a book I'm reading
[1:21:04] about what's taking place in this day
[1:21:08] and they said one to another did not our
[1:21:12] heart burn within us while he talked
[1:21:14] with us by the way and while he opened
[1:21:17] unto us a scripture you know when you
[1:21:20] want to know why we're shouting for joy
[1:21:21] you know that's why I say I want to look
[1:21:24] that honey that you guys had an optimum
[1:21:26] and I want that here well we can have
[1:21:28] that here you know cuz my heart is
[1:21:30] burning within me from the things that
[1:21:32] he has shown me along the way and you
[1:21:35] can have the same experience of you walk
[1:21:37] with them this third full pull that's
[1:21:40] for the bride and it's knowing the mind
[1:21:43] of Christ and walking in the vision
[1:21:45] that's in this word and couple more
[1:21:48] quotes and we'll finish and look away to
[1:21:52] Jesus he says it's tightening that
[1:21:55] squeeze and then when that time comes
[1:21:57] and the priest comes to a place where
[1:21:59] you're pressed out then watch what I'm
[1:22:01] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[1:22:03] watch the third pull then see it'll be
[1:22:06] absolutely to the total lost but it will
[1:22:10] be for the bride and the church now we
[1:22:13] are closer than it seems to be I don't
[1:22:15] know when but it's real real close I may
[1:22:19] be building a platform for somebody else
[1:22:21] to step on I may be taken before that
[1:22:24] time I don't know and that time maybe
[1:22:28] this coming week that the Holy Spirit
[1:22:30] will come and bring Christ Jesus and he
[1:22:36] may come this next week he may come yet
[1:22:39] tonight I don't know when he will come
[1:22:41] he doesn't tell us that but I do believe
[1:22:43] that Y that we are so close that I would
[1:22:48] never die with old age yet at 54 years
[1:22:51] old I'll never die with old age until
[1:22:54] he's here see you know how old brother
[1:22:57] Brennan would be today I think I worked
[1:22:59] it out of it a hundred and ten I
[1:23:01] wouldn't ever die with old age until
[1:23:03] he's here unless I'm shot or killed or
[1:23:06] something else some other way killed
[1:23:09] just old age wouldn't kill me
[1:23:11] until he's come I believe that and I
[1:23:13] want to say this I've never said it
[1:23:15] before but according to scripture
[1:23:17] according to what he said 33 years ago
[1:23:19] down on the river there in 1933 rather
[1:23:23] what he said everything has happened
[1:23:25] just exactly I may not do it but this
[1:23:28] message will introduce Jesus Christ of
[1:23:30] the world because he has to be accepted
[1:23:34] by the elect and rejected by the loss
[1:23:36] the souls that are in prison they have
[1:23:38] to reject him they have it's just a
[1:23:41] manifestation of the seed that's already
[1:23:43] in them the seed that was sown in the
[1:23:45] Garden of Eden the tears among the wheat
[1:23:49] Christ is here moving among us and he's
[1:23:52] to clearing all that scripture from
[1:23:53] revelation to generate - from Genesis to
[1:23:57] Revelation he's come here to dwell with
[1:24:01] you and molding and make you and has own
[1:24:06] image and to live in you and to take
[1:24:09] control you know and it's just yielding
[1:24:11] to him that death to the flesh you know
[1:24:13] you can't do anything to Christ until
[1:24:15] there's a death to this own carnal flesh
[1:24:17] and it's hard you know we all battle
[1:24:20] with carnal thoughts and carnal flesh
[1:24:21] and subconscious and conscience as Andy
[1:24:24] would often tell me and you know and
[1:24:27] it's true because you have to die to
[1:24:28] flesh before God can use you as
[1:24:34] musicians would come up the musician you
[1:24:40] know God has given the bride all the
[1:24:42] tools that she needs everything is here
[1:24:45] for you to raise from the dead and just
[1:24:50] before I come up and I didn't really get
[1:24:52] time to study it but I'm brother Brennan
[1:24:56] was showing how Christ died in the flesh
[1:24:58] as flesh died his spirit are send it
[1:25:02] unto heaven and a saw went down into
[1:25:04] prison so now here we stand upon the
[1:25:07] earth with our flesh slain crucified to
[1:25:10] our own will and desire our solar stuck
[1:25:14] down here in this miserable Richard
[1:25:16] place as Satan's eat and our soul is
[1:25:18] stuck here preaching to the souls in
[1:25:20] prison our spirits are send it to an
[1:25:23] open door and revelations for
[1:25:25] because we are now seated in heavenly
[1:25:26] places with Christ what our spur and
[1:25:29] brother branham said the only thing I
[1:25:32] mentioned it at the start he said but
[1:25:34] there's a law that's stopping us from
[1:25:35] speaking in our own world into existence
[1:25:37] right now there's a law there that's
[1:25:40] stopping there and I feel like you know
[1:25:44] my theophanies behind this fence and I'm
[1:25:47] so close to it that I'm trying to climb
[1:25:49] over that fence to get to my theophany
[1:25:51] but brother Branham says one day that
[1:25:53] bar will lift that law will break and
[1:25:56] the Spirit will come down and it'll meet
[1:25:59] the soul and then will rise and be an
[1:26:01] ell theophany bodies but there's a work
[1:26:03] that has to be done now and I'm so glad
[1:26:06] that I can say that I've accepted what
[1:26:09] he's done in this age and that we're
[1:26:11] walking in their vision I mean I thought
[1:26:14] maybe nursey rewrote my life would be a
