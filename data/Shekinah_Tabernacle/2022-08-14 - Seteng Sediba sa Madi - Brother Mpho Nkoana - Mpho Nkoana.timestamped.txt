[0:00] i'm glad to see each one of you
[0:02] so the song the song that i'm going to
[0:05] sing
[0:06] relates to also what brother isaac
[0:08] the other the other uh
[0:10] stanza that spoke about
[0:13] the fire on the day of pentecost so
[0:17] if maybe this is the italian i've trans
[0:18] my wife translated not me
[0:21] my wife helped me to translate it
[0:24] just for you to follow what it means um
[0:27] or you know that's the closest
[0:29] translation we could get but i'll sing
[0:31] it in my mother tongue
[0:33] and because i believe god is not limited
[0:36] by language
[0:37] language barrier those are the things of
[0:39] the devil
[0:41] language barrier is the things of the
[0:42] devil that's why we can speak of
[0:44] heavenly tongues here and the spirit of
[0:46] the lord just makes us one language amen
[0:49] there was there was only one language
[0:50] before they went to the to the tower of
[0:52] bible isn't it
[0:54] sorry i'm not preaching
[0:56] um
[0:58] so
[0:59] thank you for that song that stanza that
[1:01] that spoke about uh pentecostal fire
[1:05] because this song
[1:08] when that pentecostal fire
[1:10] you know splashed when it's placed and
[1:12] bested some of the sparks
[1:15] fell there in africa somewhere
[1:17] some of those parks they fell and landed
[1:20] somewhere in africa and that's where
[1:22] some of these songs that i'm seeing now
[1:24] emanated from those missionaries went
[1:26] out there although they had some
[1:28] ulterior motive some of them but some i
[1:30] believe they were guided by god
[1:33] because this kind of songs could not
[1:35] just come from the devil
[1:37] and that's why i'm here today because of
[1:39] those kind of
[1:40] inspirations amen so the song
[1:43] if kira can help me i just told him
[1:46] hardly this morning
[1:47] so
[1:48] if the boy can play it well just bear
[1:50] with him but i believe
[1:51] he can catch the inspiration it says
[1:59] [Music]
[2:21] is
[2:24] [Music]
[2:36] [Music]
[2:42] [Music]
[2:43] is
[2:46] [Music]
[3:01] [Music]
[3:16] [Music]
[3:23] [Music]
[3:59] [Music]
[4:28] [Music]
[4:31] amen
[4:33] [Applause]
