[38:01] lazy won't work won't do nothing then it
[38:03] takes grace to keep that family together
[38:06] he says oh god it takes the grace of
[38:08] jehovah to keep his family together
[38:11] and that's the way where jehovah's
[38:13] family today is because of the grace of

[42:11] love upon the lord jesus christ
[42:13] amen he shall call upon me and i'll
[42:15] answer him
[42:16] i will be with him in trouble i'll
[42:18] deliver him and honor him
[42:19] with long life will i satisfy him and
[42:21] will show him
[42:23] my salvation amen and we're just going
[42:25] to read from
[42:26] exodus chapter 33 here just a bit of a
[42:29] context
[42:30] um well i trust and and we're going to
[42:33] just read from verse 8 down to 11.
[42:48] exodus 33 and verse 8 and it came to
[42:50] pass when moses went out unto the
[42:52] tabernacle
[42:53] that all the people rose up and stood
[42:55] every man at his tent door and looked
[42:57] after moses
[42:58] till he was gone into the tabernacle and
[43:00] it came to pass as moses entered into
[43:02] the tabernacle the cloudy pillar
[43:04] descended and stood at the door of the
[43:05] tabernacle
[43:06] and the lord talked with moses and all
[43:08] the people saw the
[43:10] cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
[43:12] door and all the people rose up and
[43:14] worshiped every man in his tent
[43:16] and the lord spake unto moses face to
[43:18] face as a man speaketh unto his friend
[43:20] and he turned again into the camp but
[43:22] his servant joshua the son of none a
[43:24] young man departed
[43:26] not out of the tabernacle amen i just
[43:29] pray the lord bless his word this
[43:31] morning may have your seats
[43:34] i'd like to speak about living under
[43:36] someone's shadow
[43:39] it's going to throw this definition out
[43:41] there and then we're going to um
[43:43] go into the service but so so living or
[43:45] walking in someone's shadow so it's a
[43:47] so there's just you know i just googled
[43:49] it there's a saying you know you're
[43:50] walking in someone's shadow and
[43:51] and it's to walk in someone's shadow
[43:53] this idiom is used to portray that
[43:55] something or someone is following in the
[43:57] footsteps of someone larger
[43:59] who is perhaps ahead of them in life
[44:01] this figure could be usually a father
[44:03] figure a business person etc
[44:05] but i want to talk about someone far
[44:06] greater than it's living in the shadow
[44:08] of the lord
[44:09] amen you know we know there's many
[44:10] shadows that someone can live in
[44:13] uh but i just want to focus on joshua
[44:15] here amaze
[44:16] it's amazing the incredible things i'm
[44:18] going to try and get out of first gear
[44:20] but you know
[44:22] oh boy anyway joshua lived an incredible
[44:26] life
[44:27] he you know many times we would we would
[44:29] think of joshua when when he was
[44:31] commissioned in joshua chapter one to be
[44:33] strong and courageous and you know place
[44:34] the people in the land but
[44:36] he was living under the shadow of moses
[44:38] for 40 years before this
[44:40] he he saw an example lived in front of
[44:42] him that was an incredible example
[44:44] because the scripture would tell us that
[44:46] you know there's no prophet like like
[44:48] like moses was where god would speak lip
[44:50] to ear to a man
[44:51] and and and and i put the scripture up
[44:53] here because it's incredible where
[44:55] where god would come down into the
[44:56] tabernacle and the people would stand in
[44:58] there
[44:59] you know you know and and watch this all
[45:01] take place but joshua was in the
[45:03] tabernacle with moses
[45:04] and he would see god come down and he'd
[45:06] see god speak to moses and
[45:08] and this this this was an incredible
[45:10] impression on his life
[45:12] and and i pray that you know we would be
[45:15] the same kind of god would live in our
[45:16] lives in
[45:17] in such a way that the younger
[45:19] generation would come under the same
[45:21] kind of and you know impression
[45:23] where you know it's amazing there is a
[45:26] saying that
[45:27] uh familiarity breeds contempt and it's
[45:30] not a scriptural saying it's just a
[45:31] saying that someone put out there
[45:32] where the more familiar you are with
[45:34] someone it can actually breed a contempt
[45:37] because you see all their strengths but
[45:38] you see all their weaknesses
[45:40] you see their good days you see their
[45:41] bad days you see their upside down days
[45:43] you see the days they wish they never
[45:45] got out of bed in the morning but you
[45:46] see all those days
[45:48] but so joshua saw all those days with
[45:50] moses
[45:51] he saw moses when he stood in the gap
[45:53] and said lord take my life blot my name
[45:55] out of the book that the people would be
[45:57] saved
[45:57] he saw moses do incredible things saw
[46:00] him open the red sea
[46:01] call the plagues do everything like that
[46:03] but then he also saw the days where
[46:05] where moses was stressed
[46:07] you know moses was having a hard day
[46:08] moses was you know feeling the strain of
[46:11] the people
[46:12] and you know and and he also saw moses
[46:14] frustrations he saw when he just got
[46:16] sick of it
[46:17] you know you know he got mad and he even
[46:19] even called the people of israel you
[46:20] bunch of rebels do i have to bring water
[46:22] out of this rock for you and he smote
[46:24] the rock and
[46:25] you know he saw when when moses would
[46:27] get in the mood and maybe moses was real
[46:29] tired and
[46:30] people were badgering him and calling on
[46:32] him and he saw maybe moses wrecked in
[46:34] the flesh
[46:34] quite a bit too i mean because brother
[46:37] brahm said you know when god came down
[46:38] it was god speaking through moses but
[46:40] after the anointing left and moses
[46:42] was moses and so and so joshua beheld
[46:45] the good
[46:46] the bad and the ugly of moses but this
[46:49] did not
[46:49] make joshua that this wasn't the shadow
[46:53] that joshua was living under
[46:55] when when when he was following moses
[46:57] you know because
[46:58] because joshua could look past i mean
[47:00] yeah joshua could look past the flesh of
[47:02] moses
[47:03] he could look past his humanity he could
[47:05] look past his troubles he could look
[47:07] past maybe how he would talk to people
[47:09] maybe in an off kind of way or
[47:10] i don't know how he addressed the people
[47:12] but you know he could look past
[47:14] what the other people found fault in and
[47:16] he could see god amen and that's the
[47:18] main thing
[47:19] i mean when we can look at one another
[47:20] and see look past our humanity
[47:23] look past our troubles look past our you
[47:25] know
[47:26] you know as i said maybe last sunday
[47:28] sunday ago you know they kind of all
[47:30] merged together nowadays but
[47:31] you know our children you know we are
[47:34] our best and our worst at home
[47:37] our best and our worst hallelujah we put
[47:40] on our church face we come to church
[47:42] hallelujah
[47:43] and we should anyway because god's good
[47:45] god yo
[47:46] my lord jesus has done nothing bad
[47:48] towards me
[47:49] so i should worship him with everything
[47:51] i have amen because he's only done good
[47:53] he's only loved for me cared for me
[47:55] guided me
[47:55] pulled me out of very many dangerous
[47:58] places so
[47:59] you know i've got nothing to hold
[48:00] against him that's why i come to church
[48:02] and praise the lord
[48:03] amen but you know but you know so so
[48:05] joshua saw the good he saw the bad and
[48:08] he saw the ugly of moses
[48:10] but he could look past that and see god
[48:12] and that's what made now so he wasn't
[48:15] living under the shadow of moses
[48:16] humanity
[48:17] there were other people in the camp that
[48:19] did corey and dayton would rise up and
[48:21] they'd just be offended and be annoyed
[48:23] at moses
[48:24] they say you think you're the only holy
[48:25] one in the place we're all holy and you
[48:27] know
[48:27] they would rise up and try and usurp
[48:29] authority and you know
[48:31] because they they were they were looking
[48:33] at moses humanity and they perceived the
[48:36] faults that were within him
[48:37] and he had faults we all have faults
[48:41] if you didn't say amen you're either
[48:42] deluded or you i don't know
[48:45] you know yeah yeah isn't there a little
[48:48] song you know um
[48:49] you know kids would sing it i am so
[48:51] great i am so glad everybody loves me or
[48:53] something i am so great who's had kids
[48:55] sing that
[48:56] no okay anyway i won't sing that one you
[48:59] know but you know some
[49:01] you know this anyway some people think
[49:03] that they just made of
[49:05] you know what i mean but you know we're
[49:06] all human
[49:08] and and moses could you know what moses
[49:10] had is good and his bad he saw this
[49:12] joshua saw the splits in the church he
[49:15] saw core and nathan rise up he saw
[49:16] trouble
[49:17] he saw you know people trying to wrangle
[49:20] their way in and do things you know he
[49:22] he he experienced the disappointment of
[49:24] katerspanier
[49:25] he saw the disappointment of wandering
[49:27] through the wilderness for 40 years
[49:29] and that whole younger generation
[49:31] experienced that they were living
[49:34] imagine that 40 years
[49:37] going around the same mountain 40 years
[49:40] we can't go on in our walk we're staying
[49:42] right here because our parents
[49:46] disbelieve the promise what an
[49:49] incredible shadow to be raised up in
[49:51] we're born imagine being born in the
[49:53] wilderness mommy and daddy where we're
[49:54] from where we're going
[49:56] why are we in this place and and they
[49:58] would have to tell their children the
[50:00] conclusion of the matter is
[50:01] we're stuck here because of our unbelief
[50:05] but somehow god moved on the hearts of
[50:08] the young people
[50:09] that they didn't live under that shadow
[50:10] of that disappointment but they actually
[50:12] received a heart of faith saying we're
[50:14] going to take this land
[50:15] we are going to break the cycle of
[50:17] unbelief that our parents are in and
[50:19] we're going to go on and possess
[50:20] every divine promise of god we're not
[50:22] just going to wander around and have
[50:24] church and go out and have church
[50:26] and go out but we're going to go on and
[50:27] take every promise amen they were living
[50:29] under a different kind of shadow
[50:32] you know what i love about living under
[50:34] a bad shadow you can come out of that
[50:36] shadow
[50:36] you don't have to stay under that shadow
[50:38] you know what i love about the weather
[50:39] it always changes
[50:42] even in this place it changes it's not
[50:44] always windy
[50:45] it's not always raining it's not always
[50:47] kind of cold
[50:48] there's the sunny days hallelujah
[50:52] you know people say you know you can
[50:54] never beat wellington on
[50:55] on a good day well it's probably because
[50:56] we only have the one good day you know
[50:58] but you go you travel north a bit and
[51:01] every day is way better than our best
[51:02] day
[51:03] but you know we have our good days the
[51:05] weather always changes
[51:07] so we can be living under a cloud but we
[51:09] don't have to stay under that cloud
[51:11] and we can be living under a
[51:13] disappointment you know it's not just
[51:14] people that we live
[51:15] walk in the shadow of we can walk in the
[51:18] shadow of regret
[51:20] something bad happened in the past we
[51:22] can be walking in the shadow of that
[51:24] we could be walking under the shadow of
[51:26] disappointment
[51:28] we can be walking under the shadow of
[51:31] pain
[51:33] you know people can carry something that
[51:34] happened to them decades ago can be
[51:36] carrying that thing
[51:37] because they're walking under the shadow
[51:39] of it we don't have to stay under that
[51:41] shadow
[51:42] hallelujah just like the weather changes
[51:45] you know
[51:46] i look outside it's raining well i know
[51:48] it's not always going to be raining
[51:50] it's winter middle of winter i'm sorry
[51:52] i'm not a fan of winter i love summer
[51:54] i love those baking hot days i just i
[51:56] just love those kind of days
[51:58] you know but i know the middle of winter
[51:59] where the days are real short you get up
[52:01] in the dark you you come home in the
[52:03] dark
[52:03] i know it's not always going to be
[52:05] winter there will be another spring
[52:07] there will be another summer right
[52:09] so it doesn't matter you may be going
[52:11] through the most gloomiest part of your
[52:12] life there will be another spring
[52:15] there will be even families go through
[52:17] cycles of of a summer time everything's
[52:19] going fine and then something just
[52:20] happens and
[52:21] you know then then there's a winter time
[52:23] and everything seems to be going hard
[52:24] but then there's a summer again
[52:26] right so so families go through seasons
[52:28] you know go through cycles and
[52:30] you know but we don't have to take the
[52:32] memory of of winter
[52:34] into into summer into spring we can say
[52:37] praise the lord i'm glad i'm not back
[52:38] there
[52:39] now if you love winter well you enjoy
[52:41] the snow
[52:42] you know it's pretty to see it fall but
[52:43] then you got to go live in it you know
[52:45] anyway maybe i was
[52:47] flatting too much in christchurch and
[52:48] freezing places and all the snow and
[52:50] it's so wonderful and then
[52:52] it's freezing and you can't feel your
[52:54] feet and you're inside and
[52:56] anyway you know but there will be
[52:57] another spring
[52:59] so people can live under the under the
[53:01] shadow
[53:02] of negative things for for for very long
[53:05] but but i don't want to
[53:07] focus on that but i just want to say you
[53:08] can come out of the shadow of that
[53:10] you can come out of it just like you
[53:12] know um even
[53:14] even as as as david would would would
[53:16] come to the throne and
[53:17] and he would he would um he would ask
[53:20] the question
[53:21] let's see any of jonathan's house alive
[53:25] and they found out that mephibosheth was
[53:28] was one of joshua's uh
[53:30] jonathan's sons rather and and he found
[53:32] out that he was alive
[53:34] and jonathan i mean sorry mephibosheth
[53:37] was crippled
[53:39] because when jonathan and saul died in
[53:41] battle the nurse picked them up and ran
[53:43] for
[53:44] ran ran ran for their lives and when he
[53:46] has been carried he got dropped and his
[53:48] feet became crippled
[53:50] so he was living under a shadow of being
[53:53] a crippled outcast
[53:55] for many years but then dave
[53:58] remembered his promise with jonathan
[54:02] and then he asked the question is any of
[54:03] jonathan's house still alive so
[54:05] what was happening david wanted to bring
[54:07] mephibosheth out of that shadow
[54:09] i want to bring him to my table i want
[54:11] to bring him to the king's table
[54:12] i don't want him to be far away
[54:14] somewhere living in this you know i'm a
[54:16] i'm far away from the throne you
[54:18] know i
[54:18] i was once living there because my my
[54:21] grandfather was the king you know but
[54:22] now i'm far away and you know sometimes
[54:24] we feel very far away from god and god's
[54:26] far away somewhere and
[54:28] we're just in a corner somewhere and he
[54:29] doesn't care and he does care
[54:32] it's the devil that wants to keep us
[54:33] under a shadow but then because david
[54:36] remembered his promise with jonathan
[54:38] he got mephibosheth and didn't want him
[54:40] to be a
[54:41] a a a servant he didn't want to make him
[54:44] make fun of him
[54:45] i mean in his court he wanted to restore
[54:47] him to his rightful place
[54:49] at the king's table and the beautiful
[54:51] thing about mephibosheth is he has
[54:53] crippled in his feet but when he was
[54:55] sitting around the king's table
[54:57] and the and the and the tablecloth you
[54:59] know came down over
[55:00] over his legs and everything you
[55:01] couldn't see his crippled places he
[55:03] looked like
[55:04] everyone else at the king's table amen
[55:07] so he didn't have to live under that
[55:08] shadow of the past anymore
[55:10] he was the same as everyone else at the
[55:13] table
[55:14] hallelujah what's that got do with
[55:16] living under a shadow god wants to pull
[55:18] us out of those places
[55:20] amen joshua would live
[55:24] under the shadow of moses he would walk
[55:27] with moses he would see what moses would
[55:29] do
[55:31] but the main thing is that same god that
[55:33] that that he would watch and come down
[55:34] and speak to moses
[55:37] he met that same god he knew that god
[55:39] was a you know god is you know
[55:42] many times we make promises to god god
[55:45] i'll stop doing this
[55:46] i'll start doing this i'll be like this
[55:49] we have to stop putting trust in our
[55:51] promises
[55:52] and start believing his promise right
[55:54] because it's his promise that will bring
[55:56] us out
[55:56] it's not us trying to turn a new leaf
[55:58] though those things are good because our
[55:59] attentions are good but it's not lord
[56:01] i'll do this and all this
[56:02] no no you just take faith in his promise
[56:04] and let him change you
[56:07] amen now so joshua lived under the
[56:11] shadow of moses
[56:14] and he saw beyond the humanity of moses
[56:18] and he saw god and then so now when it
[56:20] was ma
[56:21] joshua's time because remember god
[56:23] doesn't want us to live under the shadow
[56:26] he wants us to walk with him personally
[56:29] so it wasn't enough for god god wasn't
[56:31] satisfied just having joshua be
[56:33] be moses minister he had to come to his
[56:36] position in time
[56:38] amen and when he did amen the same god
[56:41] that
[56:42] that that moses knew joshua met
[56:46] hallelujah
[56:53] amen see the lord pardon me
[56:56] the lord has always been a family man
[57:00] he says it's an adoption he says so
[57:06] we won't read it but if you read genesis
[57:08] 1 it says and the lord
[57:10] uh god made heavens and earth but then
[57:12] when man's coming the picture says and
[57:14] the lord god
[57:15] so what's happening is he's called god
[57:18] that's elohim self-existing one
[57:20] but then the lord god means the
[57:21] self-existing one who reveals himself
[57:24] who has relationship and because that
[57:26] was always god's purpose he says but in
[57:28] genesis 2 when he made man he said i
[57:30] am uh y h u j u
[57:34] v u h yahweh jehovah what does it mean i
[57:37] am the all
[57:38] existence one who has created something
[57:40] off of myself to be a son of mine
[57:42] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[57:44] of mine glory
[57:45] why he gave man jehovah means he gave
[57:47] man to be an amateur god
[57:49] because he is father god and he made a
[57:52] man an amateur god
[57:53] so he isn't self-existent anymore he
[57:55] exists with his family
[57:58] now some of us when we think of god as a
[57:59] father kind of cringe
[58:02] because of our earthly fathers but you
[58:05] know
[58:06] and and that you could say the problem
[58:07] and i'm very much preaching to myself
[58:09] is that how our parents i mean how our
[58:11] children see god they'll see it because
[58:13] how we treat them
[58:15] and and i'm i'm sorry that that's the
[58:17] case but that's the case
[58:19] but you know so so sometimes some of us
[58:20] cringe it you know god being a father
[58:22] but he's a father
[58:23] amen he's a father i mean he's not just
[58:26] a husband or a bridegroom or you know
[58:28] he's our father i mean so so he exists
[58:31] with his family
[58:32] allah elohim now now he is jehovah
[58:36] jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[58:38] his family now god
[58:39] made man to be the predominant over all
[58:41] the earth
[58:43] he had dominion and the earth was man's
[58:45] dominion is that scripture
[58:47] then if that's his dominion he was god
[58:50] over the earth he would could speak and
[58:52] it would move it would be so
[58:54] he could speak this and it would be so
[58:55] old there he is god jehovah the one who
[58:58] once existed
[59:00] in self-existence but now exists with
[59:02] his family and his little ones with him
[59:05] he says there
[59:06] you are now maybe he said that as there
[59:09] you are that's what it means but to me
[59:11] says there you
[59:11] are jehovah with his family there you
[59:14] are
[59:15] amen because he's a family man and as a
[59:18] family man he wants his little ones
[59:20] around him hallelujah
[59:23] and as a family man he's a protector
[59:27] amen we may see the world falling apart
[59:29] but we are living under a different kind
[59:31] of shadow
[59:32] i mean we're not living under the shadow
[59:34] of fear the shadow of doubt the shadow
[59:36] of worry
[59:36] we're living under the shadow of the
[59:38] almighty that's why we read psalms 91.
[59:41] i mean they that dwell i mean let's just
[59:43] go there just because it's such a
[59:44] powerful
[59:45] a powerful um psalm he that dwelleth in
[59:49] the secret place the most high shall
[59:51] abide under the shadow of the almighty
[59:53] that's not a shadow of gloom that's not
[59:55] a shadow of doubt there's not a shadow
[59:57] of fear
[59:57] that's a shadow of the almighty amen
[1:00:00] i'll say the lord he is my refuge and my
[1:00:02] fortress my god and whom will i trust
[1:00:04] surely he shall deliver deliver thee
[1:00:06] from the snare of the fowler
[1:00:07] and from the noisome pestilence he shall
[1:00:10] covet thee with his
[1:00:11] feathers and under his wings shall thou
[1:00:13] trust his truth
[1:00:15] shall be thy shield and buckler
[1:00:18] hallelujah so this is a great place to
[1:00:20] dwell
[1:00:22] amen this is where we're meant to dwell
[1:00:24] remember remember he is he is jehovah
[1:00:26] existing with his family and if he is a
[1:00:28] family man which he is he wants his
[1:00:30] family around him
[1:00:31] that's why he called israel out of egypt
[1:00:33] he says out of egypt i've called my son
[1:00:35] so he gathered them to himself and the
[1:00:37] purpose that he built the tabernacle is
[1:00:39] that he would dwell with his family
[1:00:41] hallelujah but we know that that was
[1:00:43] never meant to be the end
[1:00:44] you know the resting place of god but
[1:00:46] god didn't just want to be with his
[1:00:47] children he want to be in there
[1:00:49] in them amen that's why you know brother
[1:00:51] brown would say in christ is a mystery
[1:00:53] god revealed
[1:00:54] um if we can find that and i have it
[1:00:57] here i'm sorry you know me and
[1:01:00] well i'd probably say disclaimer every
[1:01:02] service the first thing
[1:01:03] god wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:01:05] people he couldn't do it as a great
[1:01:07] jehovah god who covered all space
[1:01:09] time and eternity he could not he was
[1:01:12] too great to ever be revealed to people
[1:01:13] because it would be too mysterious
[1:01:16] how could that great being that never
[1:01:17] did begin who had the question when they
[1:01:20] were young when did god begin
[1:01:22] amen yeah because we can't fathom
[1:01:24] eternity
[1:01:25] you know that after you went beyond the
[1:01:27] cycle of hundreds of billions and
[1:01:29] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:01:30] light space
[1:01:31] and go out into the infinite into the um
[1:01:34] eternity in a great creature
[1:01:35] uh that was all that and still is but
[1:01:39] what he wanted to do
[1:01:40] this brother brahms telling us this is
[1:01:42] you know because remember when he
[1:01:43] preached his service
[1:01:44] he said i'm going to tell you what was
[1:01:45] in the back part of god's mind before
[1:01:46] the foundation of the world
[1:01:48] and and i can't remember who said it but
[1:01:49] they said how he came with this
[1:01:52] service as he is he studied with the
[1:01:54] bible in a concordance and he gave us
[1:01:56] christ the mystery god revealed that's
[1:01:57] more than a man putting the word
[1:01:58] together that's god
[1:02:00] so so now now this is god revealing the
[1:02:02] back part of his mind to you
[1:02:04] this is what he wanted to do he loved
[1:02:06] fatherhood
[1:02:08] for he was a father and the only way he
[1:02:10] could express it was to become a son a
[1:02:12] man
[1:02:13] that's the reason jesus kept saying the
[1:02:15] son of man see they didn't know what he
[1:02:17] was
[1:02:18] talking about many of them but now do
[1:02:20] you get it
[1:02:21] congregation says amen see he wanted to
[1:02:23] express himself that
[1:02:25] that was his one of his great threefold
[1:02:27] purposes was to express himself
[1:02:29] identify himself with human beings to
[1:02:31] reveal himself and cry
[1:02:33] secondly to have the preeminence in his
[1:02:34] body of believers that is his bride
[1:02:36] that he might live in people
[1:02:40] so before there is a molecule he says
[1:02:42] i'm a father
[1:02:44] i love fatherhood it's who i am and then
[1:02:47] he created all this
[1:02:48] universe and the milky way and the
[1:02:50] nebulas and all the different things
[1:02:52] and the whole purpose was to put you on
[1:02:54] this little speck
[1:02:56] and this whole you know there's way
[1:02:59] bigger suns than our sun
[1:03:00] there's way bigger planets than our
[1:03:02] planet but this one has life on it
[1:03:05] surely you know you think well there's
[1:03:07] way better people on the earth than than
[1:03:08] than uri sure there are but there's life
[1:03:12] and the believer there's a predestinated
[1:03:13] seed so his focus now i pray god
[1:03:16] saved him too don't get me wrong but
[1:03:17] there's a focus god has a focus
[1:03:19] right he has a focus on the earth the
[1:03:22] reason his life is here
[1:03:23] his children are here he didn't just
[1:03:25] make this place or you
[1:03:27] just to see if he could he made us and
[1:03:29] this earth for a purpose
[1:03:31] and that purpose is that he would walk
[1:03:33] with you and you would know him and love
[1:03:35] him
[1:03:36] hallelujah you would manifest his
[1:03:37] purpose upon the earth
[1:03:39] hallelujah why because he's a family man
[1:03:42] he cares about his family
[1:03:44] his whole purpose of being is for his
[1:03:47] family
[1:03:48] he's not selfish right he's not selfish
[1:03:51] but his whole purpose of being is for
[1:03:53] you
[1:03:55] hallelujah you know loneliness is from
[1:03:58] hell
[1:04:00] to feel alone is from hell because hell
[1:04:03] is full of lonely people
[1:04:05] there's no camaraderie there there's no
[1:04:07] you know we're in this together kind of
[1:04:09] thing no no everyone's alone there
[1:04:11] that's how hell is the feelings that
[1:04:13] creep into you know you know upon the
[1:04:15] earth now of being alone being depressed
[1:04:17] being being aimless having no purpose
[1:04:20] that's all from hell
[1:04:21] that's all from hell you know our our
[1:04:24] father's not distant
[1:04:25] we may have had distant fathers i'm not
[1:04:27] speaking for myself with that but you
[1:04:28] know you may have had the most distant
[1:04:30] father in
[1:04:31] all of ever our god's not like that
[1:04:34] you just may have had a father didn't
[1:04:36] care and was so absorbed in himself
[1:04:38] our father's not like that our god isn't
[1:04:40] like that
[1:04:41] hello he's not distant amen we're never
[1:04:45] meant to feel alone
[1:04:47] that's the devil trying to cloud us over
[1:04:49] it's amazing how brother brown would
[1:04:51] would would describe spirits in meetings
[1:04:54] and and i don't have it on me here but
[1:04:56] he says i want to write a book about
[1:04:57] demonology and he described different
[1:04:59] spirits of like
[1:05:00] looking like like spiders with long hair
[1:05:02] and tortoises and
[1:05:04] you know different different shapes of
[1:05:05] animals these spirits would take these
[1:05:07] forms as they're being cast out and
[1:05:09] you know and he'd see a gloominess of
[1:05:11] darkness over the people and you know of
[1:05:13] unbelief or
[1:05:14] hurt or whatever it may be trying to
[1:05:16] block them from the visitation of god
[1:05:18] or feeling alone or feeling numb or
[1:05:20] feeling indifferent you know that's all
[1:05:21] from hell
[1:05:23] we have to identify remember our the
[1:05:25] human the human being is not made to
[1:05:27] feel
[1:05:28] empty the human being is not made to
[1:05:30] feel alone
[1:05:31] the human being is not made to feel
[1:05:34] uncaring completely
[1:05:36] we're not ice blocks where do those
[1:05:39] feelings come from
[1:05:40] the devil but we have to recognize
[1:05:43] that's where they're from
[1:05:45] remember god is love hallelujah
[1:05:48] our god is love he's not he's not a god
[1:05:52] of
[1:05:52] just just wrath and judgment and
[1:05:54] destruction no he's a god of love
[1:05:57] hallelujah he doesn't want us feeling
[1:06:00] you say well god so far from me i'd say
[1:06:01] that's probably a demon spirit
[1:06:03] trying to block you god doesn't care
[1:06:06] about me well where'd you get that
[1:06:07] thought from you know i wish i had one
[1:06:09] of brother andy's curry pots right here
[1:06:12] i've been using that pot all week
[1:06:16] i hope everyone else has two and it
[1:06:18] hasn't burned on the bottom it still
[1:06:20] works real well
[1:06:21] hallelujah because we're going to stop
[1:06:24] and think why do i feel this way
[1:06:27] is this my father trump remember he
[1:06:28] loved fatherhood
[1:06:30] and a real father loves to spend time
[1:06:32] and and pour themselves into their
[1:06:34] children and you know
[1:06:35] love them and have relationship and talk
[1:06:37] to them and you know even though
[1:06:38] sometimes we find it difficult yeah
[1:06:40] we're not great communicators for some
[1:06:42] reason men in the fall they lost their
[1:06:44] ability to talk and you know sometimes
[1:06:46] but you know but but but our god is not
[1:06:48] distant
[1:06:49] he's not a person of stone or you know
[1:06:51] it just doesn't speak
[1:06:52] he wants to speak more than we want to
[1:06:54] hear brother brown would say you know he
[1:06:56] would say that he wants to give us the
[1:06:57] holy ghost more than we want to receive
[1:06:59] it
[1:07:00] hallelujah so you know all those things
[1:07:02] were to think now what shadow am i
[1:07:04] living under if that's going on
[1:07:10] i got one here
[1:07:16] now you can see this on film this is
[1:07:18] from the um you know 20th century
[1:07:20] prophet film this is the this is the
[1:07:22] prayer line but afterwards she she can
[1:07:24] see this this is not just on tape
[1:07:26] he said excuse me sister i have to relax
[1:07:28] my mind once in a while
[1:07:30] now we'll be strangers i see that you're
[1:07:32] strictly a stranger to me
[1:07:34] you're from you're from away from here
[1:07:36] you come from another city
[1:07:38] you've got a lot of trouble on your
[1:07:39] heart and you've got heart trouble to
[1:07:41] begin with is that right
[1:07:43] there's a whole lot of blackness i see a
[1:07:45] black sheep
[1:07:46] keep following you like that so she's
[1:07:48] living under a shadow
[1:07:50] oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:54] and that's what that was a man who was
[1:07:56] professing divine healing the sister
[1:07:58] says yes sir
[1:07:59] and you can actually see she's actually
[1:08:00] crying if you if you who's watched that
[1:08:05] so she she recognizes not this man
[1:08:07] speaking to me this is more than a man
[1:08:09] speaking to me
[1:08:10] how can this one know my life our father
[1:08:12] knows all about us
[1:08:14] he knows everything about us the good
[1:08:15] and the bad he knows about your humanity
[1:08:18] he knows about your weaknesses
[1:08:21] hallelujah he knows about the weaknesses
[1:08:23] the things that we wrestle with so much
[1:08:25] and we and we hate so much
[1:08:26] he knows all about them hallelujah
[1:08:29] but yet he still saved us because he
[1:08:32] wasn't looking at our humanity he's
[1:08:34] looking at the seed that he put on the
[1:08:35] inside of us before the foundation of
[1:08:37] the world
[1:08:38] hallelujah amen
[1:08:41] now is that true see you've got a
[1:08:42] holster in your church or something
[1:08:44] another about it
[1:08:45] isn't that right so this is what a lie
[1:08:47] can do
[1:08:48] this man told a lie and it's now go it's
[1:08:51] not just her troubled with heart trouble
[1:08:52] now the whole church has got a stir
[1:08:54] about it
[1:08:54] oh we've got a witch inaudible it's a
[1:08:57] holster it's a lie
[1:08:59] one lie look what it's doing
[1:09:02] it says now it's not just her with the
[1:09:04] shadow this black sheet following you
[1:09:06] it's now the church
[1:09:07] or something or something another about
[1:09:09] it is that right your pastor's sick
[1:09:11] right now he has got polio is that right
[1:09:14] yes sir that's her saying that sister
[1:09:16] don't pay no attention to what them
[1:09:17] people tell you they
[1:09:18] are lying the only thing that's wrong
[1:09:20] with your heart is a nervous condition
[1:09:22] has got your heart worked up go on home
[1:09:25] in peace god bless you you're right god
[1:09:27] bless you you're not a witch
[1:09:30] hallelujah you know there's a saying
[1:09:33] sticks and stones will break my bones
[1:09:34] but words will never hurt me
[1:09:36] unfortunately that's not a true saying
[1:09:39] sticks and stones may break my bones but
[1:09:40] words can scar and
[1:09:42] damage me yeah that's just a lie and she
[1:09:45] was living in this condition because of
[1:09:47] a lie
[1:09:48] but the spirit of god came down her
[1:09:50] father came down saying no
[1:09:52] no you know you're not a witch the
[1:09:55] reason that this is troubling you is
[1:09:56] because this lies affected you in such a
[1:09:58] way and you're living under that lie
[1:10:01] see she was all stirred up i'm a witch
[1:10:04] this man this man professing divine
[1:10:06] healing so obviously she saw
[1:10:07] supernatural in this man's ministry that
[1:10:09] said you're a witch
[1:10:10] now she's all troubled i'm a witch
[1:10:13] but when god came down and the whole
[1:10:16] church was stirred up too but when god
[1:10:18] came down
[1:10:19] and showed no that's a lie this is why
[1:10:21] this is go on you're not a witch
[1:10:23] and then and she wasn't living under
[1:10:25] that shadow anymore
[1:10:29] why are you saying that well many times
[1:10:31] you think well people are shadowed to
[1:10:32] death with cancer or something big or it
[1:10:34] could just be a lie
[1:10:36] something that someone told them years
[1:10:37] ago and they believe that lie and
[1:10:39] they're living according to that lie
[1:10:41] how do you think she would have been in
[1:10:43] her heart i'm a witch why am i a witch
[1:10:45] what spirit's on me and she goes to
[1:10:46] church
[1:10:47] she's living her life she's all troubled
[1:10:49] thinking that she actually has a spirit
[1:10:50] of
[1:10:51] like a demon spirit in her making her a
[1:10:52] witch
[1:10:55] would have been tough but she came to
[1:10:57] the right source
[1:11:00] hallelujah why because our god
[1:11:04] is a father and he cares for us
[1:11:07] you may think well no one cares about me
[1:11:09] in the whole world even my own earthly
[1:11:10] father he cares
[1:11:12] our god cares he cares more than you
[1:11:15] realize
[1:11:17] hallelujah
[1:11:20] now
[1:11:23] brotherhood says as an influence
[1:11:26] he says and it was a lesson to isaiah
[1:11:28] isaiah was living under a shadow of king
[1:11:30] uzziah
[1:11:31] he was impacted by a godly king but that
[1:11:33] king we know he rose up
[1:11:35] tried to take a priest place got leprosy
[1:11:38] he must have put his eyes upon human
[1:11:40] beings for an
[1:11:41] example he mustn't put his
[1:11:44] eyes upon a human being for an example
[1:11:46] he must put his eyes on god
[1:11:48] now that's us amen
[1:11:51] we can we can lift each other up too
[1:11:53] much
[1:11:54] sure we should live an example you know
[1:11:56] what i mean but you know
[1:11:58] we can put oh that one can stand i can
[1:11:59] stand but god can calls that wonderful
[1:12:01] to say now what about you
[1:12:03] remember if ten thousand four on my one
[1:12:05] side a thousand on the other
[1:12:07] david said it's not going to come know
[1:12:08] me because i'm living under the shadow
[1:12:10] of the almighty
[1:12:11] so irrespective of what's going on
[1:12:13] around me i can still walk with god
[1:12:15] it's not if the church oh if the church
[1:12:17] stays together i'm going to rapture no
[1:12:19] no
[1:12:19] no god can cause this place just to
[1:12:21] close
[1:12:22] he can say i don't know this is done
[1:12:25] spread you out somewhere
[1:12:26] oh god will never do that he could
[1:12:29] remember never never never
[1:12:31] never tried to put words in god's mouth
[1:12:34] he said but we meant to have a church
[1:12:35] sure but what i'm saying is you know
[1:12:38] we're not going into rapture because
[1:12:40] this place looks fancy
[1:12:42] we're going to rapture because we are
[1:12:44] individually walking with the lord jesus
[1:12:46] christ
[1:12:48] amen i pray this place never falls apart
[1:12:51] if if god's hand remains on it i believe
[1:12:53] it he'll he'll keep it
[1:12:56] amen i hope that's okay now
[1:12:59] any man any man is subject to mistakes
[1:13:01] he is subject to error because he's
[1:13:03] human he's subject to the violations of
[1:13:05] god's laws he's subject to many things
[1:13:07] because satan tempts him and he's just a
[1:13:09] human being
[1:13:10] and if god ever lifted his hands we
[1:13:13] he would fall that's all and i've heard
[1:13:16] people say oh satan can't do
[1:13:18] that he's brother says yes you just let
[1:13:20] god lift his hand
[1:13:21] one time and watch what happens he says
[1:13:24] it's i constantly plead god don't send
[1:13:27] him have mercy on me keep away from me
[1:13:29] you see i need god's mercy we all need
[1:13:32] that
[1:13:34] and and and when did brother brown
[1:13:36] preach this after the seals
[1:13:37] after he's an adopted son receiving the
[1:13:39] sword in sabino canyon the word of god
[1:13:41] he's in his place
[1:13:43] in the body he's saying lord keep him
[1:13:46] away from me
[1:13:47] don't lift your hand off me hallelujah
[1:13:51] we don't want to get puffed up and say
[1:13:52] well i can do this now then god just
[1:13:54] lifts his little pinky off you
[1:13:56] and all hell breaks loose lord keep me
[1:13:59] under the shadow keep me under your hand
[1:14:01] lord
[1:14:02] keep me in your hand oh god
[1:14:05] hallelujah we're going to jump to
[1:14:12] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:14:15] brother brahm says
[1:14:16] i don't want that arrogant selfish
[1:14:18] spirit mixed up with mine
[1:14:21] i want my spirit to be pure and clean
[1:14:23] brotherly love holy with the holy spirit
[1:14:26] now if someone does anything wrong to me
[1:14:28] that's all right
[1:14:29] and though i might have the right to get
[1:14:31] back at them
[1:14:33] oh boy you know how you get ammunition
[1:14:37] i'm ready i've got it
[1:14:42] i don't want to i don't want that in my
[1:14:43] life
[1:14:45] no i want to have love i want to be
[1:14:48] ready to correct with love with love
[1:14:51] that
[1:14:51] absolutely answers out yonder for it
[1:14:55] so he says i don't want that arrogant
[1:14:57] selfish spirit mixed up with mine
[1:15:00] well how can we get such a spirit it
[1:15:03] depends what shadow that you're under
[1:15:06] you know eve
[1:15:09] eve came under a different shadow she
[1:15:12] was once under the shadow of god
[1:15:15] but then another shadow came into the
[1:15:17] garden another influence came into the
[1:15:20] garden
[1:15:21] and this anointed a creature called the
[1:15:23] serpent
[1:15:25] and now this serpent begins to ask her
[1:15:27] questions
[1:15:29] so she comes under a shadow
[1:15:32] and then they have a conversation
[1:15:35] and he asks a question you know you can
[1:15:38] eat of every tree
[1:15:39] and and but then the serpent says about
[1:15:42] that particular tree
[1:15:44] you won't die for god doth known the day
[1:15:48] that you eat thereof then your eyes
[1:15:49] shall be opened
[1:15:50] and ye shall be as gods knowing good and
[1:15:53] evil
[1:15:55] so here is now an influence coming into
[1:15:57] our life saying
[1:15:59] you know both good and evil and
[1:16:01] sometimes you know
[1:16:02] people can get a spirit on them that
[1:16:04] they want to know everyone's flaws
[1:16:08] to try and discern what's going on in
[1:16:11] someone else's life
[1:16:12] what is that i'd say that's actually the
[1:16:15] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:16:17] paul when he came to the corinthians
[1:16:18] says i don't want to know anything among
[1:16:20] you but christ and him crucified
[1:16:22] i mean so he wasn't interested in what
[1:16:24] was going on necessarily you know this
[1:16:26] one's like this and this one's like this
[1:16:27] you know but he was more caught up and i
[1:16:30] only want to see the lord
[1:16:31] amen you got to be careful what
[1:16:33] anointing comes on your life oh but
[1:16:35] but i need to help that person hold on
[1:16:38] jesus gave a parable
[1:16:39] or he gave a teaching why try and pluck
[1:16:42] the moat out of your brother's eye
[1:16:44] you hypocrite when you got a whole beam
[1:16:45] in your own get the beam out of your own
[1:16:48] eye
[1:16:48] and then maybe you can then you can help
[1:16:50] your brother so really if we want to
[1:16:52] help one another we need to say lord
[1:16:53] work on me
[1:16:55] get those big forceps and pull the trees
[1:16:58] out of my eyes lord jesus that i can see
[1:17:00] according to your word 20 20 vision and
[1:17:02] all those things
[1:17:03] and then amen and then when you can see
[1:17:05] correctly
[1:17:06] then you can help your brother or your
[1:17:08] sister but the serpent wanted to play
[1:17:10] i'll show you good and evil
[1:17:13] why did she need to know evil why do you
[1:17:15] know balaam balaam was
[1:17:17] taken by the king of moab when he
[1:17:19] couldn't curse israel
[1:17:21] he says i'll oh i'll bring you around
[1:17:23] and uh and i'll show you the hindu parts
[1:17:27] all of the bad parts of the camp not the
[1:17:29] nice big tents and the nice great things
[1:17:30] you know
[1:17:31] all the sin all the all the all the
[1:17:34] brokenness
[1:17:35] all the horrible part of the church you
[1:17:37] know balak took
[1:17:39] balaam and said i'll show you that part
[1:17:41] and then when you see that part then
[1:17:43] you'll curse them then god will curse
[1:17:44] them
[1:17:45] and that and and that's what you know
[1:17:47] that's what the serpent comes he says i
[1:17:50] want to show you the bad parts of that
[1:17:51] person's life
[1:17:52] i want to show you all the bad they've
[1:17:54] done and their and their humanity and
[1:17:56] you don't agree with that part of them
[1:17:57] because
[1:17:58] this is how your builders how people
[1:17:59] should be built and you know
[1:18:01] all those things but then when the
[1:18:03] anointing came down on balaam
[1:18:06] he says i cannot curse what god has
[1:18:09] blessed
[1:18:10] and he says i see no iniquity in jacob
[1:18:15] this was god actually god anointed
[1:18:17] balaam this wasn't balaam's attitude
[1:18:19] about israel now
[1:18:20] this is god this is god's testimony
[1:18:23] balak said look at all this stuff going
[1:18:25] on and god actually anoints balaam and
[1:18:26] says no this is what i see
[1:18:28] god says i see no iniquity in these
[1:18:30] people they had their sin they had their
[1:18:32] trouble they had their you know
[1:18:33] humanity and the things they wrestle
[1:18:35] with but god said i don't see iniquity
[1:18:36] with these ones
[1:18:37] because they're following my pillar of
[1:18:39] fire they're following the word
[1:18:41] amen they are on their way to the
[1:18:42] promised land hallelujah they're not
[1:18:44] stuck as a denomination just just there
[1:18:46] in the land no no they're going on into
[1:18:48] every promise
[1:18:49] and god would say i see no iniquity in
[1:18:52] jacob oh my i pray that that's god's
[1:18:56] testimony of me
[1:18:57] when the devil comes around says look at
[1:18:59] this and ben does this and this
[1:19:00] this is him and this is him and god does
[1:19:02] not i don't see iniquity in my family
[1:19:05] my family's perfect this is god's sake
[1:19:07] my family's perfect
[1:19:08] hallelujah amen because remember if he
[1:19:12] makes little ones of
[1:19:13] um of himself and he's proud of his
[1:19:16] family
[1:19:18] now we know he doesn't turn a blind eye
[1:19:20] to our failures in our sin
[1:19:22] that's why he made a way hallelujah i'm
[1:19:25] glad he made that way don't you
[1:19:26] hello i'm glad we're not under blood of
[1:19:28] bulls and goats but he made a blood
[1:19:29] his own blood i mean paul what's that
[1:19:32] was the blood of god that was on
[1:19:33] the cross
[1:19:34] we don't worship a jew or a gentile that
[1:19:36] was god made flesh
[1:19:38] hallelujah amen and there he was he shed
[1:19:41] his blood upon the earth amen then the
[1:19:43] life and that blood comes into the
[1:19:44] believer and changes us
[1:19:46] and we go from glory to glory hallelujah
[1:19:50] our father cares does he care more than
[1:19:53] we'd ever fathom
[1:19:55] he cares that's why we have to care
[1:19:58] don't sit in gloom or despair or
[1:20:01] whatever your whole life may have been a
[1:20:03] tragedy
[1:20:03] don't worry about that walk out of the
[1:20:05] shadow mephibosheth life
[1:20:07] that he remembered was a tragedy i'm a
[1:20:09] i'm far away from the palace
[1:20:11] here i am
[1:20:11] i don't know if i'm going to get killed
[1:20:13] or not because i'm from the house of
[1:20:14] saul not from the house of david
[1:20:16] he's living under this fear all the time
[1:20:18] and then the one that he was afraid of
[1:20:20] called him
[1:20:21] come to my table don't be far away
[1:20:24] wherever you are come to my table
[1:20:26] be at my bank wedding table you know the
[1:20:29] very one that you know
[1:20:30] many times the one that we're afraid of
[1:20:32] is the one that can help us it is the
[1:20:34] only one that can help us
[1:20:35] you know jesus you know i love that song
[1:20:37] that brother isaac uh wrote then you
[1:20:39] sang on wednesday with brother armand
[1:20:41] i just got the conclusion jesus is on
[1:20:43] his way
[1:20:44] jesus is on his way doesn't matter how
[1:20:47] bad it gets
[1:20:48] jesus is on his way the disciples were
[1:20:50] in their boat
[1:20:51] and they were worried there was a storm
[1:20:53] and then they saw the very one that
[1:20:55] could help them was walking on the water
[1:20:57] towards them
[1:20:58] and they were more afraid of the one
[1:21:00] that could help them than the storm
[1:21:02] itself
[1:21:04] you know we go through trials we go
[1:21:06] through hardship and then jesus comes
[1:21:08] walking out on that storm
[1:21:09] oh it's a spirit what's this going on
[1:21:11] they were scared of him
[1:21:13] and he said no it's me it's the master
[1:21:15] hell there why because jesus was on his
[1:21:18] way
[1:21:18] why because his children were caught in
[1:21:20] a storm and he didn't want them to drown
[1:21:22] he wanted them to get to the other side
[1:21:25] hallelujah we're going to get to the
[1:21:26] other side one day
[1:21:28] more than across the natural sea we're
[1:21:29] going to go into a rapture amen we're
[1:21:31] going to recognize
[1:21:32] jesus is on his way it doesn't matter
[1:21:34] how bad it gets how
[1:21:35] you know i love the story brother brown
[1:21:37] would would would tell i think it's from
[1:21:39] world war one there was that platoon of
[1:21:41] soldiers however many they were
[1:21:42] they were hemmed and they were pinned
[1:21:43] down by german machine gun fire
[1:21:46] and they tried to send a runner to you
[1:21:47] know because they knew they were going
[1:21:48] to get massacred they couldn't get out
[1:21:50] they were stuck there
[1:21:51] and and and didn't matter how many
[1:21:53] people tried to run out you know they'd
[1:21:54] get shot whatever so but
[1:21:56] someone had to carry a pigeon hallelujah
[1:22:00] and then so they wrote a little note and
[1:22:01] they pinned it to that carrier pigeons
[1:22:03] you know
[1:22:04] leg and that was their hope this is
[1:22:06] their only hope
[1:22:07] they released them into the heavens and
[1:22:09] they and they watch his carry pigeon go
[1:22:11] up and then the germans try and kill it
[1:22:13] you know and
[1:22:13] it gets wounded whatever but somehow it
[1:22:15] made it it made its way
[1:22:17] hallelujah to its destination and
[1:22:20] somehow landed in the headquarters and
[1:22:22] the
[1:22:22] someone picked it up took the took the
[1:22:24] um bit of paper read the coordinates
[1:22:26] help were under attack whatever send
[1:22:28] reinforcements
[1:22:29] hallelujah and then and then they sent
[1:22:31] reinforcements and that whole platoon
[1:22:32] was saved because of a carrier pigeon
[1:22:34] sending a message
[1:22:36] julia we had a laugh we had a dove of
[1:22:38] god one day
[1:22:39] when adam's fallen race was hemmed in
[1:22:42] hallelujah and he went up into glory
[1:22:44] with his own blood
[1:22:45] holy with a message hallelujah
[1:22:48] hallelujah yo what i love about the
[1:22:50] whole thing reinforcements
[1:22:52] came i say jesus came jesus was on his
[1:22:55] way
[1:22:55] hallelujah it's the same thing with you
[1:22:58] and it doesn't matter how much you know
[1:22:59] we hemmed him by the devil we can't get
[1:23:01] out he's pinned us to the mat you know
[1:23:03] we're in our
[1:23:03] last final moments we think jesus is on
[1:23:06] his way
[1:23:08] hallelujah
[1:23:15] jesus has purpose our father has purpose
[1:23:19] he's not just occupying time
[1:23:22] our god has purpose
[1:23:25] it must have been an incredible scene
[1:23:27] there in jarius's house
[1:23:29] this was his only daughter and she just
[1:23:32] got sicker
[1:23:34] and sicker and sicker
[1:23:37] she would have dries loved his daughter
[1:23:41] no doubt they would have got the best
[1:23:42] doctors they could have got no doubt
[1:23:45] they would have got a little
[1:23:46] a lot of meals the synagogue would have
[1:23:48] cared for them that you know he was well
[1:23:49] liked in society
[1:23:51] he would have got a lot of help but the
[1:23:53] one that he needed to get to
[1:23:55] he was told to stay away from because
[1:23:58] they were commanded if any man go to
[1:24:00] anyone go to his meetings they'll be
[1:24:02] excommunicated from the synagogue
[1:24:04] but jurassic he would go uh in
[1:24:07] disguisement brother brown would say
[1:24:08] and and he would go into the meeting
[1:24:10] secretly no one would identify who he
[1:24:12] was
[1:24:12] and he would watch the discernment he
[1:24:14] would watch the healing he would watch
[1:24:16] the wonders
[1:24:16] and he would begin to see this jesus of
[1:24:18] nazareth that the people speak against
[1:24:20] so much against
[1:24:21] i mean this is actually the messiah i
[1:24:23] mean this word that we have received
[1:24:25] that god has come down in this end time
[1:24:27] and he's revealed himself
[1:24:28] i mean it's more than healing it's the
[1:24:30] messiah it's jesus today
[1:24:33] hallelujah and so he would slowly watch
[1:24:36] his daughter get weaker
[1:24:38] and weaker and weaker and then finally
[1:24:42] he had to come to a point i can't go
[1:24:45] secretly
[1:24:46] i've got to go now i've got to go in the
[1:24:49] open
[1:24:50] and i've got to get him to come and
[1:24:51] touch her because otherwise she's going
[1:24:53] to die
[1:24:54] remember she was getting sicker and
[1:24:57] sicker
[1:24:58] and sicker by the whole time jesus was
[1:25:00] on his way
[1:25:01] yes sir sure they had a lot of sympathy
[1:25:03] in the house they had a lot of medicines
[1:25:05] they did all they could
[1:25:06] they prayed all they could pray but they
[1:25:08] needed him to come
[1:25:10] and then so here he goes he puts on his
[1:25:12] preacher's coat
[1:25:13] he runs out to where jesus is pushes
[1:25:15] through the crowd
[1:25:16] he doesn't care oh that's jurassic oh
[1:25:18] he's the leader of the synagogue all the
[1:25:20] whispers in the crowd because everyone
[1:25:21] talks about everyone
[1:25:22] you know he didn't care about that he
[1:25:24] didn't care about being exposed
[1:25:26] he was willing to come to the master
[1:25:28] hallelujah and then so she
[1:25:30] then then he falls down at his feet and
[1:25:33] then and then says you know fell at his
[1:25:35] feet and besought himself greatly
[1:25:36] yes what's a what is besotting him
[1:25:39] greatly that's not
[1:25:40] um my daughter's unwell can you please
[1:25:42] come we will be convenient to you no no
[1:25:44] it's
[1:25:45] jesus my daughter's gonna die come
[1:25:48] come to my house please come to my house
[1:25:50] jesus
[1:25:52] hallelujah my little daughter life at
[1:25:54] the point of death i pray thee come and
[1:25:55] lay thy hands on her
[1:25:57] that she may be healed and she shall
[1:26:00] live
[1:26:01] hallelujah and jesus went with him and
[1:26:03] much people followed him
[1:26:04] and thronged him and we know uh you know
[1:26:07] if you keep reading down i don't have
[1:26:08] the scripture on me but
[1:26:10] you know this is where the woman with
[1:26:11] the blood issue got healed
[1:26:14] hallelujah but jesus was on his way to
[1:26:16] driest house
[1:26:17] he he just had a burden i've got to get
[1:26:19] to jesus
[1:26:20] hallelujah and he got to jesus that's
[1:26:22] the thing we can get to jesus too you
[1:26:24] know
[1:26:24] even in a even in a very chopped up kind
[1:26:26] of service like this we can get to jesus
[1:26:29] uh we can get to him amen and and and he
[1:26:31] can meet our needs
[1:26:33] and then so he was on his way with
[1:26:35] jarius
[1:26:36] but as he was on his way finally draz is
[1:26:39] thinking
[1:26:40] the answer has come she'll be okay
[1:26:43] she'll be okay but finally when jesus
[1:26:46] was walking with him
[1:26:48] she breathed her last breaths gave up
[1:26:50] the ghost and died
[1:26:52] and all hope left the house because life
[1:26:55] had gone out of the body
[1:26:57] but jesus was on his way it became

[1:28:50] way

[1:29:12] of the list he doesn't have too hard and
[1:29:14] easy and you know they're all the same

[1:29:36] little dying daughter he said you might
[1:29:38] um you just might as well take her off
[1:29:41] because here i go take his name off the
[1:29:43] church book that's right i'm on my road
[1:29:46] he had a need
[1:29:47] rushing he must go now they said

[1:30:02] attitudes of people no no there's a need
[1:30:05] yes i understand all about it but i've
[1:30:06] got a dying child here and the very
[1:30:08] thing that i've hit in my heart all the
[1:30:09] time i've searched the scriptures
[1:30:11] i've attended his meetings under
[1:30:12] disguisement i've checked the scriptures
[1:30:14] and he is the messiah amen that's it
[1:30:16] amen that's the way too he says oh the
[1:30:19] church said now you remember if you
[1:30:21] um if you do well what's going to happen
[1:30:23] but dries had a need the need and
[1:30:25] brother if there ever was a time
[1:30:26] brethren
[1:30:27] that we ought to make our confession
[1:30:29] that he is the messiah the son of god
[1:30:31] that he is alive then and his power is
[1:30:33] just the same
[1:30:34] there's a need today today is the hour
[1:30:36] people are dying people are dying in
[1:30:38] churches
[1:30:39] amen he says people are oh my lord jesus
[1:30:44] hallelujah but we can live under a
[1:30:47] different kind of
[1:30:48] shadow joshua
[1:30:52] joshua lived under the shadow of the
[1:30:54] almighty
[1:30:56] he saw it in moses life he was impressed
[1:30:58] with such a life
[1:30:59] and then he and then he met that same
[1:31:01] god i'm just going to kind of
[1:31:02] wrap this up now timothy
[1:31:06] i'll just i'll just read this quickly
[1:31:10] timothy was told by paul this is the
[1:31:12] this is one of paul's last letters that
[1:31:14] he would write before he loo
[1:31:16] before his head is chopped off he says
[1:31:18] but thou
[1:31:19] has fully known my doctrine manner of
[1:31:21] life purpose
[1:31:22] faith long suffering charity patience
[1:31:25] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[1:31:27] me at antioch at iconium
[1:31:29] at lystra and no doubt timothy when when
[1:31:32] when he read those different names he
[1:31:34] he he remembered the accounts of of what
[1:31:36] happened there
[1:31:37] i mean what persecutions i endured but
[1:31:39] out of them all the lord delivered me
[1:31:42] so saying you have fully known my life
[1:31:44] because remember timothy was called
[1:31:46] paul will call him my son in the gospel
[1:31:48] so timothy was living under the shadow
[1:31:50] of the life of the apostle paul
[1:31:52] and it impacted him such a way amen that
[1:31:55] when paul's
[1:31:56] voice was silenced from the earth
[1:31:57] timothy just moved right on
[1:31:59] doing the work of an evangelist she said
[1:32:01] you've fully known my
[1:32:03] manner of life my purpose faith long
[1:32:04] suffering charity and patience my
[1:32:06] doctrine
[1:32:07] paul would have trouble in his in his
[1:32:09] flesh where where you know
[1:32:11] you know that you're that messenger of
[1:32:12] satan would would would come and buffet
[1:32:14] him
[1:32:16] so so he saw the trouble that paul would
[1:32:18] have
[1:32:19] you know in his own humanity but yet
[1:32:23] even that didn't sway timothy from from
[1:32:26] following the apostle paul
[1:32:28] because he looked beyond the flesh he
[1:32:30] saw god
[1:32:32] and he wasn't like demas who who had
[1:32:34] forsaken paul
[1:32:36] um who said well maybe paul's just
[1:32:38] washed up now maybe this is why his
[1:32:39] ministry's gone down so he did something
[1:32:41] wrong
[1:32:42] timothy stuck with him
[1:32:47] we need to be you know
[1:32:50] our god our our lord jesus he's a father
[1:32:56] don't live under the shadow of this
[1:32:58] world or trying to please someone
[1:33:01] you know people people are influenced by
[1:33:02] so many things
[1:33:04] they want to be like this guy and you
[1:33:06] know i think i've told you before
[1:33:07] you know there was a guy so i was at i
[1:33:09] was at boarding school the last
[1:33:11] four and a bit years of my high school
[1:33:13] career
[1:33:14] and and and in one boarding school i was
[1:33:17] in there was a guy in my dorm he wasn't
[1:33:18] my friend he didn't like me
[1:33:20] but i thought he was cool and i and and
[1:33:21] how he dressed i started dressing like
[1:33:23] him
[1:33:24] because i thought he was cool he somehow
[1:33:26] influenced my life
[1:33:28] what good did it do me
[1:33:31] nothing yeah but but we we let so many
[1:33:34] things influence us
[1:33:36] why don't we let the lord jesus christ
[1:33:38] be our influence live under the shadow
[1:33:39] of that
[1:33:40] don't live under the shadow of
[1:33:41] disappointment well i've done so many
[1:33:43] bad things in my life don't worry about
[1:33:44] them
[1:33:45] put them under the blood and move on
[1:33:48] although i don't know how this is gonna
[1:33:50] just just don't don't live under fear
[1:33:52] don't live under worry don't live under
[1:33:54] unbelief amen just live under the shadow
[1:33:56] of the almighty
[1:33:58] hallelujah
[1:34:02] remember he's our if he is our father
[1:34:04] he's going to take care of us
[1:34:06] amen amen if he is our father
[1:34:09] remember it's jehovah with us dwelling
[1:34:11] with his family that's what he wanted in
[1:34:13] the beginning
[1:34:14] that's what he's going to have in the
[1:34:15] end right and all the way down through
[1:34:17] time
[1:34:18] he's had his children and he's looked
[1:34:19] after his children sure some have gone
[1:34:21] through the
[1:34:22] fire and through the flood and some
[1:34:24] through a great hardship and they've
[1:34:25] some have been martyred whatever more
[1:34:27] but as their last breath leaves their
[1:34:30] body
[1:34:31] he takes them you know we're all going
[1:34:33] to go through a portal of death
[1:34:35] yes should the rapture not happen
[1:34:38] you know there was a story and and and
[1:34:40] we've been watching the cloverdale place
[1:34:42] and and i'll just finish with this but
[1:34:44] you know brother brown asked a question
[1:34:46] where did you come from where are you
[1:34:47] going
[1:34:49] where where'd you come from i'm not
[1:34:51] talking about naturally i'll say well
[1:34:52] i'm from gisborne no no that's not what
[1:34:53] he's asking
[1:34:54] where'd you come from where are you
[1:34:56] going
[1:34:58] and and brother brown would i think he
[1:35:01] mentioned it but
[1:35:01] but but they did a play about the 40
[1:35:03] soldiers for christ who's heard that
[1:35:05] story
[1:35:07] so during the time of the romans i think
[1:35:09] it was the time of nero as one of the
[1:35:11] emperors
[1:35:12] when when when christendom was was was
[1:35:15] was
[1:35:15] coming to its forefront there was a
[1:35:18] decree made throughout the roman empire
[1:35:20] that
[1:35:20] every roman i think every just soldier
[1:35:23] they had to make a sacrifice
[1:35:24] to the emperor i think it was nero at
[1:35:26] the time i might be wrong
[1:35:28] because they the they believed that the
[1:35:30] emperors were gods
[1:35:32] but there were 40 soldiers in a in a
[1:35:34] legion they were christians
[1:35:37] and and the decree came out you are the
[1:35:39] sacrifice to the emperor make a
[1:35:41] sacrifice
[1:35:42] or you're going to die and they decided
[1:35:44] they're going to die
[1:35:46] and so so they were given the so so what
[1:35:49] they were
[1:35:50] did they were they were put in prison
[1:35:53] for a week
[1:35:54] and this one man looked after them in
[1:35:56] prison i think that's how the story goes
[1:35:58] because because the leader of the army
[1:36:00] or the captain whoever he didn't have
[1:36:02] the jurisdiction to
[1:36:03] to to execute these these prisoners now
[1:36:06] had to wait for the general to come and
[1:36:08] it took him a week to arrive then they
[1:36:09] had a court trial
[1:36:11] and this general tried to make them say
[1:36:13] yuri can't
[1:36:14] you sacrifice to the emperor or you're
[1:36:17] gonna die
[1:36:18] and how you're gonna die as you see that
[1:36:20] frozen lake out there you have to walk
[1:36:22] out on that lake you're going to go out
[1:36:23] there naked
[1:36:24] in the night and you're going to die
[1:36:25] you're going to freeze to death
[1:36:28] and and they decided no no no we are we
[1:36:30] are not going to sacrifice
[1:36:32] to the emperor because what good does an
[1:36:34] earthly man do
[1:36:36] what good can an earthly man do for you
[1:36:38] and i or a woman
[1:36:39] what good can they do you can give your
[1:36:42] whole life to some great hero of this
[1:36:44] world what good will he do
[1:36:46] when you come to the life end of end of
[1:36:48] life's journey but people live under the
[1:36:50] shadow of
[1:36:51] they're fans of so many different ones
[1:36:52] and and none of those people that they
[1:36:54] care about imagine
[1:36:55] imagine if i was just a big you know i
[1:36:57] think i think brother isaac used this
[1:36:58] illustration
[1:36:59] imagine if i loved darts and and all i
[1:37:03] lived i lived
[1:37:04] lived and breathed darts from some
[1:37:06] sunrise to sunset
[1:37:08] and i had all the famous people on my
[1:37:10] wall and you know all those things
[1:37:12] and i gave my life savings to go see
[1:37:14] them play in a tournament
[1:37:16] and this was my big ambition in life i
[1:37:19] want to see this talk this is the world
[1:37:20] chat this is the world championship man
[1:37:22] this is big this guy's going to play
[1:37:24] against this guy and you know how's it
[1:37:25] going to work out and
[1:37:26] all the stats and all those things you
[1:37:28] know but then i go there
[1:37:31] i see them play it may be the greatest
[1:37:34] bout of darts that's ever happened in
[1:37:36] the history of man but then i go home
[1:37:39] and i'm just living with a memory what's
[1:37:42] that going to do me
[1:37:43] and then i come to the end of my life
[1:37:47] and i've given my whole life to darts
[1:37:49] nothing against darts
[1:37:50] anyone who plays darts you know whatever
[1:37:52] but i'm just using it as an illustration
[1:37:53] because it's safe
[1:37:54] you know it's a safe thing to talk about
[1:37:57] but what good would it do me if i live
[1:37:59] and breathe darts all my life
[1:38:01] is that's going to take me into heaven
[1:38:04] it can't
[1:38:05] so what's good giving our life for some
[1:38:07] human upon the earth
[1:38:10] whatever the cause is it can't help me
[1:38:13] when i come to my last breath
[1:38:15] oh but jesus was a human but he was god
[1:38:18] and he still is god so so these soldiers
[1:38:20] said no no
[1:38:21] we'll go freeze on the lake so they put
[1:38:23] guards around the lake
[1:38:25] and they actually had a bath house that
[1:38:27] was right on the lake's edge
[1:38:29] and they had the fires all hot and they
[1:38:31] and
[1:38:32] and they told the soldiers if when you
[1:38:34] come and recant
[1:38:36] you come give your sacrifice to to the
[1:38:38] emperor in this bath house it's nice and
[1:38:39] hot
[1:38:40] but they march out on the ice 40
[1:38:42] soldiers for christ 40 brave soldiers
[1:38:44] for christ
[1:38:45] and they go out there naked freezing and
[1:38:48] they stand out there in the cold
[1:38:51] and then and then all through the night
[1:38:52] they're singing 40 brave soldiers for
[1:38:54] christ and their but their voices get
[1:38:56] quieter and quieter because some begin
[1:38:57] to die
[1:38:58] and one of them looks at the bath house
[1:39:01] because they can see it from where
[1:39:02] they're standing on the lake because
[1:39:03] everything's dark but they can see the
[1:39:05] light of the bathhouse
[1:39:06] one of them actually half frozen
[1:39:10] makes his way back to the bath house and
[1:39:13] as he gets near the bath house he
[1:39:14] actually begins crawling because he's
[1:39:16] half dead
[1:39:18] and then he gets and then he gets into
[1:39:19] the bath house and he dies
[1:39:22] now what good was that that guy was
[1:39:26] telling girls last night that guy will
[1:39:27] be remembered for the guy who turned
[1:39:28] back
[1:39:30] he lived just as long as the others on
[1:39:31] the ice
[1:39:33] he was trying to pay homage to an
[1:39:35] earthly king that will save his earthly
[1:39:36] life
[1:39:38] but he that loses his life jesus says
[1:39:41] shall keep it
[1:39:42] yes and he that keeps their life shall
[1:39:44] lose it well what do you mean if you
[1:39:45] lose your life you'll keep it if you
[1:39:47] lose your life as and you give it to the
[1:39:48] lord jesus
[1:39:49] that my life is no longer mine i've lost
[1:39:51] it i've given to him i'll keep it at the
[1:39:52] end
[1:39:53] but if i keep my life to myself because
[1:39:55] i'm under the shadow of something else
[1:39:56] that's not god
[1:39:57] i'll lose it at the end but then does
[1:40:00] that happen there was one of the guards
[1:40:01] it was there's either one of the guards
[1:40:03] around the lake or
[1:40:05] or the man who was guarding them in the
[1:40:06] prison
[1:40:08] history says the spirit of god struck
[1:40:10] him he ripped off his armor and
[1:40:12] everything
[1:40:13] and he ran out onto the ran out onto the
[1:40:15] ice and said 40 brave soldiers for
[1:40:17] christ
[1:40:18] he was so he was living under a
[1:40:19] different shadow it was maybe just for a
[1:40:22] week he was living under that shadow but
[1:40:24] it so impacted him
[1:40:26] that he gave his life for this jesus
[1:40:28] that he just heard about
[1:40:30] hallelujah so what shadow are we living
[1:40:33] under
[1:40:35] we can live under the shadow of the
[1:40:36] world we can live under the shadow of
[1:40:37] pain or some
[1:40:38] some something from the past or we can
[1:40:41] come out of that
[1:40:43] and say lord i want to live under the
[1:40:45] shadow of your wings amen
[1:40:51] i would rather live under the shadow of
[1:40:52] the almighty
[1:40:54] i think that's the best place to be
[1:40:56] doesn't matter what comes what goes
[1:40:58] what happens i'm if i'm under his wings
[1:41:02] i'll be okay we'll meet those guys on
[1:41:05] the other side you know
[1:41:07] we'll meet those brothers hallelujah
[1:41:11] and as they overcame we'll overcome why
[1:41:14] because they are living under the same
[1:41:16] shadow as we
[1:41:17] are under the shadow of the almighty
[1:41:19] amen let's
[1:41:20] um musicians if you just want to come
[1:41:22] this morning and
[1:41:26] just leave it there
[1:41:32] i pray that the lord jesus would so be a
[1:41:36] influence on our lives that we just want
[1:41:40] to live under the shadow of his wings
[1:41:43] he's worthy isn't going to be wonderful
[1:41:48] one day
[1:41:51] should life leave these bodies we we
[1:41:54] don't need to be afraid
[1:41:57] hallelujah that holy ghost has been in
[1:41:59] us all our lives when we really met him
[1:42:03] will carry us into glory

[1:42:13] just want to ask you the question
[1:42:15] do you want to come out from under a
[1:42:16] shadow
[1:42:19] do you want to come out from living
[1:42:20] under a shadow like mephibosheth and

[1:42:33] anymore if you want to be remembered in
[1:42:35] prayer you just want to raise your hands
[1:42:36] to the lord

[1:43:13] lord and then you brought him father
[1:43:15] lord you commissioned him to take the
[1:43:16] people into the land and
