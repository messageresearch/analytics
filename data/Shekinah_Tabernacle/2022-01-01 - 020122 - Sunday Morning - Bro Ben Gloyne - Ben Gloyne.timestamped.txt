[44:57] hallelujah it could be the greatest
[44:59] understatement ever made but amen it's
[45:01] pretty good
[45:02] i'm in exodus 32 and 1
[45:05] and when the people saw that moses
[45:07] delayed to come down out of the mount
[45:09] the people gathered themselves together
[45:11] unto aaron and said unto him up make us
[45:14] gods
[45:15] which shall go before us as for this
[45:18] moses the man that brought us up brought
[45:20] us up out of the land of egypt we want
[45:23] not uh what has become of him and aaron
[45:26] said unto them break off the golden
[45:28] earrings which are in the ears of your
[45:29] wives of your sons and of your daughters
[45:31] and bring them unto me and all the
[45:33] people break off the golden earrings
[45:34] which were in the ears and brought them
[45:36] unto aaron and he received them at their
[45:39] hand and he fashioned it with a graving
[45:41] tool after he made it a molten calf and
[45:44] they said these be thy gods are israel
[45:47] which brought thee up out of egypt and
[45:50] when aaron saw it he built an altar
[45:52] before it and aaron made a proclamation
[45:54] said to tomorrow as a feast to the lord
[45:56] and they rose up early on the morrow and
[45:59] offered burnt offerings and brought
[46:00] peace offerings and the people sat down
[46:03] to
[46:04] eat and to drink and rose up to play and
[46:06] the lord said unto moses get thee down
[46:09] for thy people which thou bore us out of
[46:10] the land of egypt have corrupted
[46:12] themselves they have turned aside
[46:14] quickly out of the way which i commanded
[46:17] them
[46:18] they have made that them a molten calf
[46:20] and have worshipped it and have
[46:22] sacrificed there unto and said these be
[46:25] thy gods of israel which have brought
[46:26] thee up out of the land of egypt now
[46:29] we're just going to drop down to verse
[46:30] 15
[46:32] and moses turned and went down from the
[46:34] mount and the two
[46:36] tables of the testimony were in his hand
[46:38] and the tables were written on both of
[46:40] their sides on
[46:42] on the one side and on on the other they
[46:44] were written and the tables were the
[46:46] work of god and the writings were the
[46:48] writings of god graven upon
[46:50] the tables and when joshua heard the
[46:53] noise of the people as they shouted he
[46:55] said unto moses
[46:56] there is a noise of war in the camp
[46:59] and he said it is not the noise of them
[47:01] that shout for mastery neither is this
[47:03] voice of them that cry for being
[47:05] overcome but the noise of them that sing
[47:08] do i hear so they will they were one
[47:11] accord
[47:12] uh
[47:13] let's keep reading and it came to pass
[47:15] as soon as he came down to the camp that
[47:17] he saw the calf and the dancing and
[47:19] moses anger waxed hot and he cast the
[47:21] tables out of his hands and break them
[47:23] beneath the mount and he and he took the
[47:26] calf which they had made and burnt it in
[47:28] the fire ground it the powder and stored
[47:30] it upon the water and made the children
[47:31] of israel drink it
[47:33] and moses said unto aaron what did these
[47:35] uh what did this sorry what did this
[47:38] people unto thee
[47:40] what did this people under thee i'll get
[47:42] there eventually that thou hast brought
[47:44] so great a sin upon them and aaron said
[47:46] let not the anger of my lord wax hot
[47:49] thou knows the people that they are set
[47:51] on mischief and they said unto me make
[47:53] us gods which shall go before us for uh
[47:57] for as for this moses the man that
[47:59] brought us up out of land of egypt we
[48:01] what not what has become of him and i
[48:03] said unto them whosoever
[48:05] hath any gold let them break it off so
[48:08] they gave it me then i cast them to the
[48:10] fire and they there came out this calf
[48:12] and when moses saw the people were naked
[48:14] for aaron had made them naked unto their
[48:16] shame among their enemies
[48:18] then moses stood in the gate of the camp
[48:20] and said who is on the lord's side
[48:22] let him come unto me and all the sons of
[48:24] levi gather themselves together unto him
[48:28] i want to take a thought from there
[48:29] who's on the lord's side
[48:32] amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[48:34] prayer we just read the word gracious
[48:35] heavenly father we love you so much you
[48:38] are the greatest one lord that we could
[48:40] ever find lord if we had a million
[48:42] lifetimes we'd never find a one greater
[48:44] than you because you are the greatest
[48:45] one we love you so much we just pray
[48:47] lord as we read your word may you anoint
[48:49] it one more time anoint it to our hearts
[48:51] oh god may we lord this year lord jesus
[48:54] we want to
[48:55] uh be more like you
[48:57] dear god so may you just mold us and
[48:59] shape us by your word lord to make us
[49:01] more in your image i pray father if
[49:03] if you're terry and we stand here in
[49:05] 2023 we could look back at 2022
[49:08] irrespective of what will happen this
[49:09] year we do not know but father it's all
[49:11] in your control but lord we ought to
[49:13] look back and say we are more like the
[49:15] lord we're we're we're close with you
[49:17] you have mulders and shaped us lord to
[49:19] be more like you so father have your way
[49:21] in our lives we just want to commit the
[49:22] service into your hands lord we always
[49:25] want to remember those who couldn't make
[49:26] it here today maybe they're on holiday
[49:28] maybe they're unwell in their bodies
[49:30] father i pray you'd be with them be
[49:31] their portion for your glory in jesus
[49:33] christ's name amen amen god bless you
[49:36] may have your seats this morning um
[49:39] so i just want to throw this question
[49:41] out who's on the lord's side it's it's
[49:44] amazing you know when we look at now i
[49:46] just want to sometimes you've got to
[49:48] define terms and things uh before you
[49:50] begin because i don't want this to be
[49:51] some abstract idea but when i talk about
[49:54] who's being on the lord's side now when
[49:56] i say about who's on the lord's side i'm
[49:58] saying now who's on now the lord's side
[50:00] is to stand for his word
[50:02] right so so that's being on the lord's
[50:04] side it's not some abstract thing but if
[50:07] you stand for his word you're on the
[50:08] lord's side okay so now because we know
[50:12] he is the word in john 1 and 1 it says
[50:14] in the beginning was the word the word
[50:16] was with god and the word was god i mean
[50:18] so so to be on the lord's side is to
[50:20] take the side of the bible of the word
[50:23] of the message of the hour right and we
[50:25] know god's word is always right
[50:27] right it's never been popular but real
[50:30] truth has never been popular so if you
[50:32] want to live life as a popularity
[50:34] contest try and live it a different way
[50:36] right live for truth live for the lord
[50:39] now it's amazing how
[50:40] where where where moses would be uh
[50:44] you know standing here
[50:45] um he would you know it says the lord
[50:48] you know it's amazing god knows what
[50:49] we're doing
[50:50] you know they had they didn't know where
[50:53] their god was and um but here god was
[50:55] having a conference with moses saying
[50:57] this is what the people are doing while
[50:58] you're away
[51:00] and so
[51:01] god knows everything that we're doing
[51:03] but then when moses comes down the
[51:04] mountain now here is the man
[51:06] that god has used mildly to bring them
[51:08] out of slavery they were once once their
[51:11] children were you know once their sons
[51:13] were being fed to the crocodiles once
[51:15] they were being whipped by slave masters
[51:17] once they had no even control over where
[51:20] they lived what they do they were beaten
[51:21] without mercy you know they were under
[51:24] extreme bondage they cried out to god
[51:26] that god would deliver them and but yet
[51:28] yeah and then and then god answered
[51:30] their prayer he sent a man called moses
[51:32] and god went in that man called moses
[51:34] and he delivered them with a mighty hand
[51:35] now but then they came to the place
[51:37] where the word would be restored or i'd
[51:39] rather the word would be known god's way
[51:42] of worship would be made known to them
[51:44] but they said well he's taking too long
[51:46] let's make our own god
[51:48] let's let's craft something of our own
[51:49] imagination that you know that we can
[51:51] worship and and i say that you know if i
[51:53] could say this with uh with no malice or
[51:56] any meanness in my voice you know or
[51:58] heart but you know this is how the
[51:59] church has been
[52:00] you know people many people know about
[52:03] jesus 2000 years ago and he was alive
[52:05] there and he was present there but you
[52:06] know people in fashioning their own
[52:08] ideas all the way down through but you
[52:10] know we live in a time where god's truth
[52:12] has been restored
[52:14] amen and then so so i don't know uh
[52:17] exactly
[52:18] how much the sons of levi partook of
[52:20] what everyone was doing but it just said
[52:22] everyone did it
[52:24] but then when the call came from moses
[52:26] who's on the lord's side
[52:28] they gathered
[52:29] they gathered because a voice the voice
[52:31] of god came into the camp
[52:33] amen from the gate of the camp he cried
[52:35] out who's on the lord's side let them
[52:36] come unto me
[52:38] and they something in them said i'll
[52:39] gather to you
[52:40] i'll gather to you moses now when i talk
[52:42] about moses i'm talking about the word
[52:44] right because the prophet in the bible
[52:46] represents the word of god to the people
[52:48] right so so there was a call came who's
[52:50] on the lord's side and that's amazing
[52:52] why didn't everyone else stand up and
[52:53] say yeah we're all on his side
[52:56] roll on his side no it's only a portion
[52:58] of them for whatever reason actually
[52:59] responded to the call
[53:01] and i pray that you know
[53:04] the this message this morning wouldn't
[53:06] necessarily condemn you but would make
[53:08] you rejoice that you'd realize who team
[53:10] who you know whose team you're on
[53:12] amen so so there they were there was a
[53:15] call came into the camp among the
[53:16] believers and the sons of levi gather
[53:19] themselves under him now it's amazing
[53:22] because
[53:23] every other time there's a crisis
[53:25] leading up to this point they all came
[53:27] to moses
[53:28] when they came to the red sea
[53:30] they murmured against him
[53:32] they came and said have you brought us
[53:33] out here to be slaughtered look we're at
[53:35] an ambush look there's the armies of the
[53:38] pharaoh is right behind us the waters in
[53:40] front of us there's hills on either side
[53:42] we can't outrun them they've got fast
[53:44] chariots we've got slow oxen and our
[53:46] love young ones and things here have you
[53:48] brought us here to die
[53:50] and
[53:51] moses just says stand still and see the
[53:53] salvation of god these egyptians that
[53:55] you see today you'll see no more forever
[53:58] so it's gonna so what he's saying is he
[54:00] is prophesying of the destruction of
[54:02] their enemy and they wouldn't see that
[54:04] enemy again and what happened
[54:06] the red sea parted
[54:09] crossed over
[54:11] pharaoh's army tried to follow and they
[54:13] died they would drown because god closed
[54:15] the sea but who did he do it through
[54:17] moses raise up your staff the water
[54:19] parted i never seen a man walk to a sea
[54:22] raise up a bit of wood and and the
[54:24] waters part
[54:25] that's incredible
[54:26] and then i never seen a man walk to that
[54:28] same sea after everyone crossed over
[54:29] raise up his staff and the water's
[54:31] closed
[54:32] so he prophesied you won't see these
[54:34] ones they're going to be dead
[54:35] you're going to be free
[54:37] and it happened
[54:39] and then they journeyed for three days
[54:41] and they were thirsty they came to a
[54:42] place of um uh and and the waters were
[54:45] bitter and they went to moses
[54:48] is there no water here
[54:50] is there no water so so they gathered
[54:52] to moses but in the wrong
[54:54] uh circumstances it was just a complaint
[54:57] the same word that brought them out of
[54:59] moses they are murmuring against it why
[55:01] did you bring us through these places
[55:02] god wants to prove our faith he wants to
[55:05] prove our faith as genuine amen it's not
[55:07] because everything's good or everyone's
[55:08] nice or whatever no no no god called us
[55:11] we follow
[55:13] if it's over over mountains down through
[55:15] valleys through bright patches doesn't
[55:17] matter we're going through
[55:19] amen so and then you know then they said
[55:21] now we're hungry
[55:23] now you can find this all through the
[55:25] scripture but i'm just to save time i'm
[55:26] just you know so they come to moses did
[55:28] you bring out bring us out here to die
[55:30] to starve
[55:32] but then when the call came see they all
[55:34] gathered hey they're thirsty they're
[55:35] hungry whatever they all gathered to
[55:37] moses and they and they didn't go to
[55:39] someone else for the answer they went to
[55:41] him
[55:42] right they went to him but then now when
[55:45] god comes
[55:46] an idolatry idolatry's already among the
[55:48] people and there's a call coming up from
[55:50] that same man who's on the lord's side
[55:52] only a few of them stood up
[55:54] only a few of them gathered wasn't
[55:55] everyone i think yeah you think it'd be
[55:58] yeah i'm on the lord so what are we
[55:59] doing here
[56:00] why we got the stupid calf it didn't
[56:02] bring us out of egypt we had to
[56:03] physically pack this thing
[56:05] you know
[56:07] but
[56:08] that's what the word the call of god
[56:11] because that's what's been done through
[56:12] the ages who's on the lord's side
[56:15] amen and i'll say those who are part of
[56:17] that call gather
[56:21] more than family
[56:22] more than church forget it
[56:24] we're going to go to heaven because of
[56:26] the blood of jesus christ because you
[56:27] know him personally
[56:29] amen
[56:30] amen that's the only way we're going to
[56:32] go and i say praise god that's the only
[56:34] way i'm going to go i'm glad it's not by
[56:35] church association i'm i'm glad it's not
[56:37] my family last name
[56:39] amen it's by are you under that blood
[56:42] amen if you're under that blood i mean
[56:44] if the life of god is in you amen you're
[56:46] you're on your way
[56:48] hallelujah amen so you know we want to
[56:50] be able to and and you know may god make
[56:53] us in such a way that we can stand true
[56:55] for the word
[56:57] you know this is a very deceptive hour
[57:00] we live in
[57:01] because in the dark ages it was either
[57:03] recant or be killed
[57:05] it was very crystal clear
[57:07] you had those two options a or b you
[57:10] can't have none of the above you've got
[57:11] to have you know choose
[57:13] and the believers gladly counted it
[57:17] not even you know the suffering the the
[57:19] small amount of suffering that go
[57:21] through was nothing compared to eternity
[57:24] hallelujah amen but in this age it's an
[57:27] age of compromise
[57:29] and floating along
[57:31] we don't want to float along
[57:33] this year could be the year jesus comes
[57:35] it's he's going to come one year we
[57:37] don't know the specific day but we know
[57:39] the time and season you know and and and
[57:41] the season's looking like it's ready
[57:44] right and you know so
[57:45] it's going to be there's going to be a
[57:47] last watch night just like jesus had the
[57:50] last passover amen there's going to be a
[57:52] last a last easter meetings or a last
[57:55] family camp there's going to be a last
[57:57] one
[57:58] right so
[57:59] if it is if this is the last
[58:02] uh first sunday of a year of a service
[58:05] praise god
[58:07] amen but there's a call has gone out
[58:09] who's on the lord's side
[58:11] i mean there's always been a call
[58:13] there's been a there's been a a pull
[58:15] from god and it goes to everyone but
[58:18] you've got to make your choice
[58:20] amen we've got to decide i'm going to go
[58:23] i'm going to gather
[58:25] amen irrespective of what everyone else
[58:27] is doing
[58:28] amen we want to we want to be on the
[58:30] lord's side now daniel i was i was just
[58:32] marveling i just think about daniel
[58:34] because jesus said i believe it was him
[58:37] he said you know you're in this world
[58:39] but you're not of this world yeah right
[58:41] so we're in this world we're in ladies
[58:43] here
[58:44] whether we like it or not here we are
[58:46] but we're not of ladies here we're not
[58:47] of this world we're not of this lukewarm
[58:50] condition we're not of but we're in it
[58:52] right we are not called to build
[58:53] monasteries and go live up in the
[58:55] somewheres far away
[58:57] no we're because we're called to be a
[58:59] living witness to be the salt of the
[59:01] earth i mean the word make contact the
[59:04] life the life within us would make
[59:05] contact with people salt brings out the
[59:08] best
[59:08] in the food may we bring out a cry out
[59:11] of people's hearts i want jesus i want
[59:14] salvation i want to go to heaven too
[59:16] amen that's why i pray my life when it
[59:19] makes contact with people around me that
[59:21] say there's something different about
[59:22] him and i actually want what he has
[59:25] hallelujah
[59:27] amen that should be our desire i believe
[59:29] you know because okay so here are now
[59:33] so we're in this world
[59:35] but we're not of this world now you
[59:36] think of daniel in the book of daniel it
[59:39] said that daniel had an excellent spirit
[59:42] and daniel
[59:44] daniel wasn't just a
[59:46] nameless public servant in the
[59:48] government
[59:50] he rose up to be actually deputy
[59:53] he was he was second under the king
[59:55] of the empire it wasn't just some little
[59:59] place in the back corner somewhere this
[1:00:01] is the world power of the day and he was
[1:00:03] second he rose up to second in command
[1:00:06] but he purposed in his heart he would
[1:00:08] not defile himself
[1:00:10] so he was very much in the world
[1:00:12] he was in the decision-making process
[1:00:15] he was you could say he was right there
[1:00:18] but when it came to anything that was
[1:00:20] contrary to his faith to his revelation
[1:00:23] he took his revelation over what the
[1:00:26] rest of the world was doing
[1:00:28] so he was on the lord's side
[1:00:32] he was on the lord's side so so here was
[1:00:34] daniel
[1:00:36] second in charge you know he was the
[1:00:37] chief among the princes the bible said
[1:00:39] and you know but yeah but then the other
[1:00:41] princes were jealous and they made that
[1:00:43] conspiracy that they're gonna you know
[1:00:45] say to the king oh king you know
[1:00:47] write a law that no one will pray to any
[1:00:49] other man or god but you for 30 days but
[1:00:52] daniel had already made up his mind
[1:00:54] i'm going gonna pray because people do
[1:00:57] what they always do
[1:00:59] right people do so daniel was a man
[1:01:01] because we're creatures of habit
[1:01:03] right he prayed three times a day he
[1:01:05] wasn't going to change because what he
[1:01:06] did but he saw the value of his prayer
[1:01:09] that was his time with god as communion
[1:01:11] with god you know if you ever want to
[1:01:14] change change your walk with god do
[1:01:16] something different
[1:01:18] if you want a closer walk with god you
[1:01:20] know we were talking to christine about
[1:01:22] new year's resolutions and she just said
[1:01:24] i want to praise him more
[1:01:26] and to me if you think about that i
[1:01:28] thought i thought that's marvelous
[1:01:29] because if you praise him more then
[1:01:32] you'll love him more and if you love him
[1:01:34] more and praise him more then you will
[1:01:36] pray more then you will read more then
[1:01:37] you'll be a more dedicated sold out
[1:01:39] christian
[1:01:40] see it's not about well i've got to do
[1:01:42] read this more and listen no no what's
[1:01:44] the whole motivation of the of the walk
[1:01:46] we are motivated by love
[1:01:49] right our whole christian walk should be
[1:01:51] motivated by divine love what was the
[1:01:53] lord jesus earthly walk what was it
[1:01:55] motivated by divine love the joy set
[1:01:58] before him was us redeemed he went to
[1:02:00] calvary full of love
[1:02:02] he was god's love manifested upon the
[1:02:05] earth so everything he did was actually
[1:02:07] motivated by divine love even even
[1:02:10] casting all the money changing and stuff
[1:02:12] out of the temple that was divine love
[1:02:14] expressed
[1:02:15] it may not look like it when you saw him
[1:02:16] but it was divine love
[1:02:18] right so our whole christian walk should
[1:02:20] not be fair
[1:02:22] i pray if you're afraid we should not be
[1:02:24] afraid meeting the lord
[1:02:26] that you thrill our souls more than
[1:02:28] anything the one who died for me i get
[1:02:30] to stand and see face to face
[1:02:33] the one who redeemed me the one who
[1:02:34] called me the one who guided me through
[1:02:36] dark places the one who wear my heart
[1:02:38] was so overwhelmed with life he led me
[1:02:40] to the rock that's higher than i he led
[1:02:42] me to the revelation i'm part of his
[1:02:43] bride i'm part of his word i'm part of
[1:02:45] him
[1:02:46] hallelujah you know so it's going to be
[1:02:48] a tremendous day
[1:02:50] well are you afraid you're going to be
[1:02:51] cast out there no because i was received
[1:02:54] here
[1:02:56] hallelujah if you've received if you've
[1:02:58] really received the baptism of the holy
[1:02:59] ghost in your soul you've been received
[1:03:01] you've been received
[1:03:03] amen and you're sealed to the day of
[1:03:04] your redemption so if you're really
[1:03:05] sealed in you can't be kicked out there
[1:03:08] hallelujah we were one of the times
[1:03:10] we're driving up to towing and we're
[1:03:11] going through the desert road we're
[1:03:12] talking about these things they're
[1:03:13] saying you know it's actually almost as
[1:03:15] good as if we're there already
[1:03:17] because we're sealed to there
[1:03:19] right and and all the rest is just
[1:03:21] victory and character development
[1:03:24] hallelujah
[1:03:25] it's character building my dad always
[1:03:26] says it's character building some things
[1:03:28] are very much character-building you
[1:03:30] know praise the lord but we need it
[1:03:31] because we want his character he's
[1:03:33] coming for a people that are all his
[1:03:35] character
[1:03:36] hallelujah so that's why all things work
[1:03:38] together for our good
[1:03:40] praise the lord amen so you know so if
[1:03:43] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:03:44] redemption it's as if you're already
[1:03:45] there in a sense because you've made it
[1:03:49] you can't be lost
[1:03:51] now that doesn't mean you get lacks no
[1:03:53] you press the battle
[1:03:55] hallelujah i was praying this morning
[1:03:56] lord may we take every divine promise
[1:03:58] this year i mean every every burden
[1:04:00] might be answered this year amen may you
[1:04:03] live more this year than ever before may
[1:04:05] you put on flesh and us more this year
[1:04:07] than ever before may we see you live
[1:04:09] more this year than ever before may this
[1:04:11] be the year of the manifestation of the
[1:04:12] sons of god in their fullness may this
[1:04:15] be the year
[1:04:16] hallelujah why not have that kind of
[1:04:18] desire i want more of jesus
[1:04:20] there's more to have let's have it all
[1:04:23] can you do that let's find out shall we
[1:04:26] why not amen so so we should have i
[1:04:29] believe that kind of burden
[1:04:30] but that but then going back to daniel
[1:04:32] daniel
[1:04:34] had an excellent spirit and when
[1:04:36] anything over stepped
[1:04:38] uh or i could say stood on what he
[1:04:40] believed he walked with god
[1:04:43] so he made a stand for the word he was
[1:04:45] on the lord's side
[1:04:46] amen the three hebrew children were the
[1:04:48] same it's amazing they were christian
[1:04:50] enough to turn up to the statue
[1:04:52] unveiling they knew what was going to
[1:04:53] happen
[1:04:54] right they weren't protesting they
[1:04:56] weren't no they just
[1:04:57] they were they were crushing enough just
[1:04:58] to turn up though they knew what was
[1:05:00] going to happen
[1:05:01] they knew you know maybe when they woke
[1:05:03] up that morning and and you know they
[1:05:05] had a little team talk before they went
[1:05:07] out there they'd say you know brothers
[1:05:08] maybe they're having breakfast together
[1:05:10] they say you know brothers you know at
[1:05:12] the end of today
[1:05:14] we're either going to be in a furnace
[1:05:16] dead we're either going to be in glory
[1:05:18] or somehow god's going to deliver us out
[1:05:19] of that furnace because you know that
[1:05:21] king what he says goes
[1:05:22] he doesn't have empty threats he says
[1:05:25] what he means
[1:05:26] hallelujah but they had prayed up they
[1:05:29] they had got the victory
[1:05:30] and when they stood there even in that
[1:05:33] whole that whole atmosphere of great
[1:05:35] pressure to bow other jews bowed they
[1:05:37] didn't bow
[1:05:38] because they were on the lord's side
[1:05:40] we want to be on the lord's side not
[1:05:41] just in word but indeed i mean and their
[1:05:44] deed was oh good king live forever sorry
[1:05:46] but we're not going to bow to your
[1:05:47] statue we'll only worship our god you're
[1:05:50] what you're commanding us to do is
[1:05:52] contrary to the word so we're going to
[1:05:53] stand with the word
[1:05:55] we're going to realize if you make a
[1:05:56] stand for god god will stand for you
[1:05:59] right god did not stand for daniel
[1:06:00] because he was back so than lukewarm no
[1:06:02] he stood for daniel because daniel had
[1:06:05] sold out given his whole life to the
[1:06:06] lord and wanted to please him with
[1:06:08] everything he said done and thought amen
[1:06:10] the same thing with the hebrew children
[1:06:12] and we know what happened they had the
[1:06:13] greatest church service ever in a
[1:06:15] furnace
[1:06:16] because the fourth man entered there and
[1:06:18] they had fellowship with the very god
[1:06:19] that they were worshiping he stepped out
[1:06:21] of history i mean they'd seen him answer
[1:06:24] by vision and by dream but now they he
[1:06:26] stepped down in reality and they had the
[1:06:28] greatest prayer meeting greatest church
[1:06:29] service they'd ever had
[1:06:31] hallelujah why because they stayed true
[1:06:33] to the word
[1:06:35] i mean they were on the lord's side now
[1:06:37] i'm already probably jumping ahead of
[1:06:38] myself but there's great benefits with
[1:06:40] being on the lord's side
[1:06:42] you know but the problem is is that
[1:06:45] many people are between two opinions
[1:06:48] elijah would would would say this to the
[1:06:51] people of israel
[1:06:52] here they had great history of god
[1:06:54] moving in power god had done things in
[1:06:56] israel that he'd never done anywhere
[1:06:58] else in any other nation amen you talk
[1:07:00] about the ministry of moses the ministry
[1:07:02] of joshua incredible things you know
[1:07:04] david killing goliath incredible things
[1:07:06] that were done these things weren't done
[1:07:08] in other nations they were done in their
[1:07:10] own nation it was their own history
[1:07:12] books when they read the bible and that
[1:07:14] god was still alive but they had
[1:07:16] forgotten him and the reason they had
[1:07:18] forgotten them is because they are
[1:07:19] between two opinions as baal goddess
[1:07:22] jehovah god
[1:07:24] because here were these people here were
[1:07:26] these
[1:07:27] prophets saying john um baal's god
[1:07:31] and they got swung because of someone's
[1:07:33] popular opinion of the day
[1:07:35] but we don't want to be swung by a
[1:07:37] popular opinion you know i believe that
[1:07:40] the that the book of acts is still alive
[1:07:42] today
[1:07:43] i believe that the bride of christ is
[1:07:45] the powerhouse of god and where the
[1:07:47] dynamics of the holy ghost has come to
[1:07:49] take over the church amen it's more than
[1:07:51] just quoting quotes but god comes and
[1:07:52] manifests the quotes in the scriptures
[1:07:54] through our lives amen that the things
[1:07:56] you read about in the book of acts the
[1:07:57] same things we should see in our own
[1:07:59] lives because brother brown said if the
[1:08:01] vine ever puts forth another branch
[1:08:02] it'll write another book of acts behind
[1:08:04] it amen i believe we're part of that
[1:08:06] number
[1:08:07] hallelujah where god is still alive upon
[1:08:09] the earth amen proving himself very much
[1:08:12] alive
[1:08:14] hallelujah that's what i believe
[1:08:17] amen
[1:08:18] i trust you jump on board with that
[1:08:20] amen we serve a real god
[1:08:23] he's not dead in 2022
[1:08:25] he's alive today as he was when he
[1:08:27] walked in his physical form he's now in
[1:08:29] bright form upon the earth amen
[1:08:32] fulfilling every promise that he has
[1:08:33] given us he is more than able to fulfill
[1:08:36] every promise
[1:08:37] his word is always right his word is
[1:08:39] always true his word is always in season
[1:08:42] it never gets old it never gets stale it
[1:08:45] should never get common it should become
[1:08:47] richer and greater to us every day and
[1:08:49] every hour amen because this you just
[1:08:51] fall in love with jesus you'll fall in
[1:08:53] love with this word i tell you amen you
[1:08:55] just hear a song or yeah i love that
[1:08:57] song all my life he's been faithful
[1:09:00] most of my life i have not been faithful
[1:09:02] i was in darkness but yet he was still
[1:09:04] faithful hallelujah
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:09] he brought me through many dark places
[1:09:10] he's always been faithful and he always
[1:09:12] will be faithful
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:18] amen now see so elijah wood would be
[1:09:22] instructed by the lord to go to ahab
[1:09:25] and he would get ahab to to to gather
[1:09:28] children of israel to mount carmel
[1:09:31] and so elijah said
[1:09:33] um he said to the people how long will
[1:09:36] you hold between two opinions
[1:09:38] if the lord be god follow him
[1:09:40] if baal then follow him
[1:09:43] and the people answered him not a word
[1:09:44] to me that's a very simple
[1:09:46] you know if jesus christ is god
[1:09:50] follow him
[1:09:51] if this message is jesus christ revealed
[1:09:53] follow it
[1:09:54] follow him if it's not forget it
[1:09:57] it's really that simple if this if this
[1:10:00] does not manifest what it says it will
[1:10:03] let's find another religion
[1:10:05] amen at this promise that i'll be with
[1:10:07] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:10:09] we should be able to see that promise
[1:10:10] who's experienced that promise
[1:10:12] the infilling of the holy ghost he said
[1:10:14] lay hands upon the sick and they shall
[1:10:15] recover who's seen that promise and my
[1:10:18] name you'll cast out devils who's seen
[1:10:19] that promise
[1:10:21] hallelujah joy and speaker will be full
[1:10:23] of glory who's seen that who's
[1:10:24] experienced that that the love of god
[1:10:26] will be abroad in your hearts by
[1:10:27] the holy ghost give it unto you who's
[1:10:29] experienced that
[1:10:30] amen who's life's been transformed
[1:10:33] hallelujah so i think we've got enough
[1:10:36] evidence in this little room to prove
[1:10:38] that the god of the scripture still
[1:10:40] lives
[1:10:41] hallelujah and it's not out of human
[1:10:43] enthusiasm this is beyond enthusiasm i
[1:10:45] mean i believe god is god is motivating
[1:10:48] a people
[1:10:49] god is anointing a people i'm talking to
[1:10:51] her a part of her right now god is
[1:10:53] actually motivating us you're going to
[1:10:54] make it
[1:10:55] i mean it may get real dark i don't know
[1:10:57] what this year will bring no one knows
[1:10:59] we go back a few years you know singing
[1:11:02] little william there over over there and
[1:11:04] yeah baby faith and you know baby lena
[1:11:06] they don't know what it's like to live
[1:11:08] pre-covered
[1:11:10] they don't know what the world was like
[1:11:12] they're now living in a new normal
[1:11:15] you know but the world has changed we
[1:11:17] never thought the you know
[1:11:19] the disciples had no idea really what
[1:11:22] would happen when jesus was dying he he
[1:11:25] told them but their world fell apart but
[1:11:27] it was a time of resurrection when the
[1:11:29] world was falling apart the resurrection
[1:11:31] was taking place so to me i think well i
[1:11:34] think the season's just right
[1:11:36] for the dead in christ to rise and our
[1:11:37] bodies to be changed
[1:11:39] hallelujah but if you're on the lord's
[1:11:40] side you'll be gathered to that amen so
[1:11:43] don't be on any other side but you see
[1:11:45] elijah
[1:11:47] he would say how long will you be be
[1:11:49] between these two opinions now these
[1:11:52] people were circumcised israelites
[1:11:55] they were jews
[1:11:57] but they had got two opinions
[1:12:00] and brother brahm says if you're between
[1:12:02] two opinions it causes spiritual amnesia
[1:12:04] you forget who you are
[1:12:06] see we need to i pray that the lord
[1:12:08] would uh anchor it into our hearts
[1:12:11] amen that we are of this we are in this
[1:12:14] world but not of this world
[1:12:16] because if we are if we realize that we
[1:12:19] are in this world but not of it we won't
[1:12:21] be caught up with whatever is trending
[1:12:22] in this world
[1:12:24] just like daniel he didn't get caught up
[1:12:25] in it the hebrew children but then so
[1:12:28] elijah would ask this question
[1:12:31] and then he would he would instruct the
[1:12:33] people now we're going to have a
[1:12:34] showdown to prove because if god's god
[1:12:36] let's serve him if baal's god let's
[1:12:38] serve him let's just make up our minds
[1:12:40] let's not toss to and fro should i be a
[1:12:43] believer should i not be a believer is
[1:12:44] the bible true is it not is the message
[1:12:46] true is it not is jesus christ the same
[1:12:48] or is he not is this the right religion
[1:12:50] or is it not let's just make up our
[1:12:51] minds let's just see yeah this is what
[1:12:53] he is saying to them and then so he told
[1:12:55] the people you are the prophets of baal
[1:12:57] they can have their bullock and their
[1:12:58] altar and they can you know they can uh
[1:13:02] set that up and they can call upon bail
[1:13:04] and then i'll sit you know sit up my
[1:13:06] altar and put the bullock at different
[1:13:07] things and you know the one who answers
[1:13:09] with fire he's god
[1:13:11] and the people just thought that's well
[1:13:13] spoken that sounds good i think that's
[1:13:15] friggin let the god who answers by fire
[1:13:18] let him be the real god
[1:13:20] hallelujah but the thing is
[1:13:23] what causes people to between to be
[1:13:25] between two opinions
[1:13:27] the reason is is they think that both
[1:13:30] options
[1:13:31] are good
[1:13:33] so they thought that baal was as good as
[1:13:36] jehovah but then jehovah's done all
[1:13:38] these miracles but baal sounds pretty
[1:13:39] good but yeah and they couldn't make up
[1:13:41] their mind because they thought both
[1:13:43] were good now unfortunately this is the
[1:13:46] same way
[1:13:47] as when people want to side with either
[1:13:49] the lord now there's only two spirits in
[1:13:50] the world
[1:13:52] you know
[1:13:53] you know there's god
[1:13:55] and there's satan
[1:13:56] there's not middle ground you know the
[1:13:58] only one who builds fences is the devil
[1:14:02] because he makes walls around
[1:14:03] denomination right he keeps people
[1:14:05] separated oh they believe different they
[1:14:07] believe this different even among the
[1:14:09] masters all these people this way you
[1:14:11] know yeah he builds fences so if you're
[1:14:14] sitting on the fence you're sitting on
[1:14:15] the devil's construction job
[1:14:17] i would get off his handiwork and i
[1:14:20] would walk with god
[1:14:22] so don't be a fan sitter but the reason
[1:14:24] people sit on the fence is they think
[1:14:26] what the devil has to offer is actually
[1:14:28] pretty good
[1:14:29] it actually has some merit in it that's
[1:14:32] why people sit on yo i'm just making
[1:14:34] them i'm not sure this person's opinion
[1:14:36] who cares
[1:14:38] you know if you have to go on the
[1:14:40] internet and say is it right for a
[1:14:42] christian to do x y and z you need to
[1:14:44] pray
[1:14:46] you need to ask god because it's not
[1:14:48] popular opinion that makes things
[1:14:50] acceptable or not it's what god has said
[1:14:52] is acceptable i will i will take him and
[1:14:55] it's not an opinion i'll take what he
[1:14:57] said above what everyone thinks because
[1:15:00] opinion will change like the wind
[1:15:02] who's ever lived in auckland
[1:15:04] no one okay i'll put my hand up there we
[1:15:06] go
[1:15:07] it's like literally four seasons in one
[1:15:09] day
[1:15:10] it could be summer time doesn't matter
[1:15:12] you wake up it's sunny then you're
[1:15:13] having morning tea it's raining and then
[1:15:15] next time it's hailing then it's windy
[1:15:16] now it's sunny again it just changes
[1:15:18] like this and that's how man's opinion
[1:15:20] is
[1:15:21] first way it's this way then by
[1:15:23] lunchtime it's like this or no we've
[1:15:24] done some research just like this no
[1:15:26] we've done some more research just back
[1:15:27] this way and you know it's like shifting
[1:15:29] sand
[1:15:30] but see that's the problem
[1:15:32] we don't want to be that way
[1:15:34] if you have a question ask the lord
[1:15:38] ask him and seek him in his word he will
[1:15:40] give you the answer
[1:15:41] if you're willing to accept it
[1:15:45] see we don't want to walk with a
[1:15:46] preconceived idea you know we should
[1:15:48] never go to prayer with your mind made
[1:15:50] up already
[1:15:52] well now i know how god will do this
[1:15:54] that's easy you pray and say yes
[1:15:56] but you've already got your mind made up
[1:15:57] no we should say lord what is your will
[1:16:01] but we never ever want to get in that
[1:16:03] place see that's why people are still
[1:16:04] pulled by the world it's because they
[1:16:06] think the devil has something to offer
[1:16:08] them which is as good as the lord
[1:16:10] that's why they get stuck
[1:16:13] can i ask a question
[1:16:15] does the devil have eternal life to give
[1:16:18] anyone
[1:16:20] does he have heaven to give
[1:16:22] does he have anything good
[1:16:25] what's the track record of his servants
[1:16:30] broken lives oh but they're super rich
[1:16:34] money it means nothing
[1:16:37] the german currency i think between the
[1:16:39] first and second world war
[1:16:41] at
[1:16:42] the bottom fell out of it so quickly
[1:16:44] that you'd literally have to have a
[1:16:45] wheelbarrow full of german marks just to
[1:16:47] buy a loaf of bread
[1:16:49] that wasn't that long ago we know
[1:16:51] unfortunately zimbabwe the same you know
[1:16:52] but currency can just fall through the
[1:16:54] you know they used to call the new
[1:16:56] zealand dollar i don't know if it still
[1:16:57] is they used to call it the japanese
[1:16:59] japanese housewives dollar
[1:17:01] because japanese housewives apparently
[1:17:03] used to trade in new zealand currency
[1:17:05] would make it go up make it go down
[1:17:07] because they'd be buying selling you
[1:17:08] know but what what what about when the
[1:17:10] market falls out
[1:17:12] i've got all these
[1:17:13] digits in a bank
[1:17:15] there's nothing behind it as brother
[1:17:17] isaac brought out there's no there's no
[1:17:19] value
[1:17:21] oh but yo my my house
[1:17:23] is worth two million dollars now
[1:17:25] next minute
[1:17:27] what what is it worth
[1:17:29] see there's nothing solid
[1:17:31] but people seem to think that you know
[1:17:34] so the devil has nothing to give
[1:17:38] you know he doesn't have eternal life oh
[1:17:41] but i get such a high
[1:17:43] no i'd rather yo
[1:17:45] drugs are just everything the devil has
[1:17:47] done as a perversion of god
[1:17:49] drugs are a perversion of being filled
[1:17:51] with the holy ghost drunkenness the same
[1:17:53] thing love he has no idea what love is
[1:17:55] the world doesn't know what real love is
[1:17:57] either amen he has no heaven to give you
[1:18:00] he has no rapture to give you he has no
[1:18:02] real lasting peace lasting joy i mean
[1:18:06] lasting satisfaction he has nothing that
[1:18:08] will give you any kind of happiness you
[1:18:10] know but the thing is people sit here
[1:18:12] and say but what will my friends think
[1:18:14] of me i know what prayer pressure is
[1:18:15] like because it took me a couple of
[1:18:16] years to get over it before i actually
[1:18:18] sold out to the lord because i was
[1:18:20] afraid i'd lose my friends but i'd
[1:18:21] rather have eternal life if they want to
[1:18:23] come with me which i pray they would
[1:18:25] have that would have been awesome too
[1:18:27] you know i wanna people think i'm cool
[1:18:30] that'll change like the weather
[1:18:34] what will my family think of me what
[1:18:36] will my friends think of me those that
[1:18:38] are willing to forsake father mother
[1:18:39] husband all those things will be given
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:43] right
[1:18:44] hallelujah
[1:18:46] but you see
[1:18:48] brother brown would say this when he was
[1:18:50] looking back this is 1952 but he's
[1:18:52] looking back to when he was 12 years old
[1:18:54] he says the only thing that kept me from
[1:18:56] being saved when i was 12 is because a
[1:18:59] spirit hung over me and a devil saying
[1:19:00] wait a little longer
[1:19:02] that's the reason that you weren't saved
[1:19:04] when you came to the age of
[1:19:05] accountability a spirit you got in a
[1:19:07] crowd and that hovered over you and kept
[1:19:10] hanging over you you wanted to do right
[1:19:13] there's not a man that's got that's got
[1:19:15] his right mind but wants to do right
[1:19:17] but there is something that won't let
[1:19:19] you do right is that right amen that's
[1:19:22] the devil
[1:19:24] so you see now
[1:19:25] there's that see but but why why would
[1:19:27] that spirit stay over someone is because
[1:19:30] that person is still agreeing with that
[1:19:32] spirit
[1:19:33] see
[1:19:34] god pulls on a heart but the devil says
[1:19:37] wait a little longer
[1:19:38] now
[1:19:39] if they sit where they are and don't
[1:19:41] respond to that call they're agreeing
[1:19:43] with the devil
[1:19:45] that's been between two opinions why
[1:19:47] because there was no no it's dumb and
[1:19:48] there's no joy there's nothing to it you
[1:19:50] don't want to be like those people and
[1:19:52] you know what about your friends and you
[1:19:53] can be this he'll give you the world
[1:19:56] based on his
[1:19:58] estimation of your value
[1:20:00] he will give you either a very great
[1:20:02] kingdom
[1:20:02] or he'll give you a small kingdom like
[1:20:04] he said to jesus he he valued jesus so
[1:20:07] highly he says i'll give you every
[1:20:08] kingdom under under heaven
[1:20:10] if you bow down and worship me
[1:20:13] so he'll give you either a very small
[1:20:15] kingdom or a big one but he'll give you
[1:20:17] something
[1:20:19] but what if that person that the lord's
[1:20:22] calling
[1:20:23] ignores that voice saying wait a little
[1:20:25] longer
[1:20:26] and response to the call
[1:20:29] what happens is they're no longer
[1:20:30] agreeing with that spirit
[1:20:32] any spirit that is contrary to the word
[1:20:34] of god is not the holy spirit
[1:20:37] amen so it really boils down to what
[1:20:39] spirit are you agreeing with
[1:20:42] the one that says wait a little bit
[1:20:44] longer or reasons away the call of god
[1:20:46] that's the wrong one
[1:20:49] amen we want to we want to stay with the
[1:20:52] law i'm on the lord's side
[1:20:54] by his grace i and i want to be more on
[1:20:56] his side i want to i don't want to be in
[1:20:58] the boundary and in and out i want to be
[1:21:00] in
[1:21:01] i know and i want to be
[1:21:03] hallelujah
[1:21:05] now
[1:21:06] elijah i mean jesus said himself in in
[1:21:09] matthew 6 and 24 no man can serve two
[1:21:12] masters for either he will hate the one
[1:21:14] and love the other or else he will hold
[1:21:15] to the one and despise the other you
[1:21:17] cannot serve god and mammon
[1:21:20] right so you can't have so you can't
[1:21:21] have a bit of the lord and a bit of the
[1:21:22] world
[1:21:23] you can't serve them both you know
[1:21:26] you only serve one
[1:21:30] we we want to live with the lord in such
[1:21:32] a way that you know well i'll just
[1:21:35] rephrase that completely you can have
[1:21:36] enough of god just to be miserable
[1:21:39] which is just a little bit have all of
[1:21:41] them have the joy and the peace break
[1:21:42] through the sound barrier
[1:21:44] hallelujah
[1:21:46] amen now
[1:21:48] now we know there is a story there in um
[1:21:50] in first kings 18
[1:21:52] the prophets of baal you know they built
[1:21:54] their altar they put the sacrifice or
[1:21:56] the wood in the sacrifice and they began
[1:21:58] to call on bail they danced around they
[1:22:00] had a great religious motion
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:04] elijah knew that it wasn't going to work
[1:22:06] because he'd already seen a vision what
[1:22:07] was going to happen so he began to mock
[1:22:09] them maybe cry louder maybe sleeping or
[1:22:11] pursuing or doing something try and get
[1:22:13] his attention and they cut themselves
[1:22:15] and they did all kinds of things but
[1:22:17] there wasn't one trace of fire anywhere
[1:22:21] and then and then elijah said in first
[1:22:24] kings 18 and 30 and elijah said to all
[1:22:27] the people come near unto me
[1:22:30] hallelujah now when there's a call come
[1:22:32] unto me it's actually i want to get your
[1:22:34] attention
[1:22:35] maybe the people of israel were still
[1:22:37] kind of watching the prophets of baal
[1:22:38] dancing around and maybe when they were
[1:22:40] exhausted lying on the ground they still
[1:22:42] were keeping them in their you know
[1:22:43] corner of their eye watching what's
[1:22:45] going to happen but then elijah said
[1:22:46] come unto me
[1:22:48] oh yeah come near unto me and all the
[1:22:50] people came near unto him and he
[1:22:52] repaired the altar of the lord that was
[1:22:54] broken down
[1:22:56] why didn't he use the uh prophets of
[1:22:59] baal's altar that alt that approach was
[1:23:01] no good
[1:23:03] but the altar of the lord he had to
[1:23:05] repair this is this is a a a key aspect
[1:23:08] of the ministry of elijah
[1:23:11] is that he repairs or restores the true
[1:23:13] access of god back to god
[1:23:16] amen we've seen it in this day
[1:23:17] hallelujah as well now so when someone
[1:23:20] says come near unto me they want your
[1:23:22] attention basically saying i've got
[1:23:24] something to show you
[1:23:25] amen this is why i'm elijah called all
[1:23:27] the people he had something to show them
[1:23:30] i mean and it was more than just a
[1:23:32] religious ritual they had most of a day
[1:23:33] of that with the prophets of baal it was
[1:23:35] more than an argument or a debate but he
[1:23:38] was going to show them the god that
[1:23:39] answers by fire
[1:23:41] hallelujah that he's the same one that
[1:23:43] met moses in the burning bush and there
[1:23:45] was a cloud by day a pillar fire by
[1:23:47] night the same one that filled the
[1:23:48] temple after solomon dedicated it i mean
[1:23:51] so he repaired the altar of the lord
[1:23:53] that was broken down now he was going to
[1:23:56] show israel what happens when you
[1:23:58] sacrifice on this altar
[1:24:01] hallelujah now we know in the scripture
[1:24:03] a stone or a rock is symbolic of
[1:24:05] revelation
[1:24:06] you know as as jesus would ask the
[1:24:08] disciples who to mean say that i am or
[1:24:10] in other words what has been revealed to
[1:24:12] them and and they would say well some
[1:24:14] say you're john the baptist or elias or
[1:24:16] jeremias or one of the prophets but then
[1:24:18] he asked the people who do you say that
[1:24:20] i am
[1:24:21] and then simon peter answered thou art
[1:24:23] the christ the son of the living god and
[1:24:25] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:24:27] are thou simon by jonah for flesh and
[1:24:30] blood has not revealed it unto thee but
[1:24:31] my father which is in heaven because the
[1:24:33] whole conversation there is revelation
[1:24:36] what has been revealed to the people
[1:24:37] while they could see the scrolls and see
[1:24:39] what the old prophets did and they said
[1:24:41] well they must be he must be one of
[1:24:43] those prophets resurrected
[1:24:45] right but then simon peter had the
[1:24:47] revelation this was the christ
[1:24:50] not just a portion of god and a prophet
[1:24:52] but the fullness of the god here bodily
[1:24:54] in the son of god
[1:24:56] amen so he says bless out thou simon but
[1:24:58] jonathan flesh and blood has not
[1:25:00] revealed it unto thee but my father
[1:25:02] which is in heaven and i say unto thee
[1:25:04] that thou art peter and upon this rock
[1:25:06] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:25:08] hell shall not prevail against it so the
[1:25:10] rock there is not peter as as i think
[1:25:13] the catholics say amen but the rock is
[1:25:15] the revelation of who jesus christ is is
[1:25:18] the rock the church is built upon so
[1:25:20] here comes elijah and he repairs the
[1:25:23] altar of the lord amen the the prophets
[1:25:26] of baal have done their thing no fire
[1:25:29] but he repairs what has already been
[1:25:30] there that's why we've been restored
[1:25:32] back to the apostolic faith
[1:25:34] the altar or the approach for the fire
[1:25:36] to fall has been restored and what
[1:25:38] happens is god puts revelation stones in
[1:25:41] your heart as the word is going forth
[1:25:43] revelation drops into your heart
[1:25:46] hallelujah but then there comes a time
[1:25:48] where the altar is built but now there's
[1:25:50] got to be a sacrifice laid upon that
[1:25:52] altar amen and that and that sacrifice
[1:25:54] is actually you
[1:25:56] that your old life is laid upon the
[1:25:58] altar
[1:25:59] hallelujah and then the fire comes down
[1:26:02] from heaven amen and burns up your old
[1:26:04] life hallelujah that it doesn't come
[1:26:06] back no more you take anything that's
[1:26:08] been burnt who's who's who's overcooked
[1:26:10] the steak a few times it just goes into
[1:26:13] ashes you can't make it meat again it's
[1:26:15] gone the fire's burned it up oh just
[1:26:18] like the fire of god when he falls upon
[1:26:20] a soul burns up that old nature takes
[1:26:22] that kills that serpent nature out of us
[1:26:25] i mean make us a new creature in christ
[1:26:27] how the fire fell so he called it he was
[1:26:29] calling come come near unto me
[1:26:32] and to me it was more than just elijah
[1:26:34] calling this was god calling come near
[1:26:36] unto me i'm going to show you what i can
[1:26:38] do
[1:26:38] i mean i'm going to answer by fire i
[1:26:41] mean and that's what happens when the
[1:26:42] word when the word calls your attention
[1:26:45] he wants to show you personally that
[1:26:47] he's still the same
[1:26:49] hallelujah so he called them come near
[1:26:51] unto me amen he repaired the altar and
[1:26:54] then he had all the water your poured on
[1:26:56] to make it impossible and then he says
[1:26:59] now then he pray says lord may the
[1:27:01] people know that thou art god and thou
[1:27:03] has turned their hearts back again and
[1:27:05] the fire fell down
[1:27:06] consumed the whole thing and then the
[1:27:08] people saw jehovah's god they weren't
[1:27:12] halting between two opinions actually
[1:27:13] saw baal's got nothing to offer us
[1:27:17] he has nothing to offer us he's not even
[1:27:19] a real god he can't do nothing because
[1:27:22] remember baal was meant to be god of the
[1:27:24] rain the water and fire
[1:27:26] and he couldn't produce either
[1:27:28] hallelujah we don't have a false hope
[1:27:32] we have a god that really produces the
[1:27:34] goods
[1:27:35] hallelujah we have a true and living god
[1:27:37] that produces the goods
[1:27:39] amen
[1:27:41] that's why i asked the question before
[1:27:42] who's been transformed who's received
[1:27:44] the holy ghost who's been healed amid
[1:27:46] all the promises of the bible who's
[1:27:47] received them
[1:27:49] hallelujah
[1:27:51] amen so he wants to bring the fire of
[1:27:54] his holy spirit down upon us
[1:27:57] hallelujah after we've laid ourselves
[1:27:59] upon the altar
[1:28:01] amen
[1:28:03] hallelujah so
[1:28:06] that took the two opinions out
[1:28:10] amen because god proved
[1:28:12] there
[1:28:13] who was on the lord's side
[1:28:16] amen and the people gathered
[1:28:18] hallelujah just like the sons of levi
[1:28:21] when the call came
[1:28:23] they they responded to the call
[1:28:26] and the reason they responded to that
[1:28:28] call is because they were part of the
[1:28:29] call
[1:28:31] it wasn't just a nice idea to gather to
[1:28:33] moses
[1:28:34] god was calling his people who's really
[1:28:36] on my side because remember when they
[1:28:38] were coming down the mountain and joshua
[1:28:40] heard the noise joshua thought there's
[1:28:42] war going on there's mastery you know i
[1:28:44] mean you know there's fighting and moses
[1:28:46] says no no there's not a cry of
[1:28:48] masteries and there's a victory on one
[1:28:50] side and a cry of defeat no it's just
[1:28:52] singing
[1:28:53] so they're actually all in this idol
[1:28:55] worship together
[1:28:57] but then when the call of god came the
[1:29:00] sons of levi separated themselves out
[1:29:02] because they they realized we're on the
[1:29:04] lord's side and i trusted something amen
[1:29:07] when the when the message came your way
[1:29:09] we're all in idolatry in some form
[1:29:12] religious idolatry maybe people can
[1:29:15] worship their car sport some someone on
[1:29:18] the street their job
[1:29:20] their family but when that call came
[1:29:23] amen i trust something and you said i'm
[1:29:25] on the lord's side
[1:29:26] hallelujah
[1:29:28] amen just like jesus would jesus would
[1:29:31] cry in matthew 11.
[1:29:33] he says come unto me all you that labor
[1:29:35] in a heavy lady and i'll give you rest
[1:29:37] amen take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:29:39] me for i am meek and lonely in heart and
[1:29:41] you shall find rest unto your souls so
[1:29:44] basically cried who's on the lord's side
[1:29:46] come unto me and i'll give you rest
[1:29:48] hallelujah
[1:29:50] and many have gathered we have gathered
[1:29:53] i mean i trust you can see you can say
[1:29:55] actually i'm on so if we're on the
[1:29:56] lord's side we're on the word side
[1:29:59] amen we're on the word side we stand for
[1:30:01] this word
[1:30:02] amen more than more than life itself we
[1:30:04] stand for this word
[1:30:06] hallelujah
[1:30:08] and the reason that is is because we are
[1:30:10] part of the word
[1:30:12] right the bride is part of the
[1:30:13] bridegroom
[1:30:14] the bride is part of the word so when
[1:30:17] the call came who's on the lord's side
[1:30:18] we find ourselves irrespective of our
[1:30:20] nationality whatever we were in
[1:30:23] creed whatever religion whatever doesn't
[1:30:25] matter but there's a call because
[1:30:26] there's a seed in us being responding to
[1:30:28] that call i am on the lord's side
[1:30:30] here i am lord
[1:30:33] hallelujah
[1:30:35] praise the lord amen
[1:30:37] amen now
[1:30:39] joshua
[1:30:41] no i'll go here before i go to joshua
[1:30:43] i'm going to close
[1:30:45] david david had some mighty men
[1:30:48] and they they loved david
[1:30:50] they knew he was coming into power
[1:30:53] they they did get in some sticky spots
[1:30:55] with him though
[1:30:57] and they got to a place called you know
[1:30:59] you know all their families were in zig
[1:31:01] lag they went to that they were going to
[1:31:02] go join the philistines to fight against
[1:31:04] saul but but the king of the philistines
[1:31:06] didn't want them there so they returned
[1:31:08] back to ziglag but when they were
[1:31:10] returning they saw smoke come out of the
[1:31:12] city and when they got into the ruins
[1:31:14] they found none of their loved ones were
[1:31:16] there
[1:31:17] and then these these ones these mighty
[1:31:20] men that gathered to david they they
[1:31:22] actually consented or planned we're
[1:31:23] going to stone this guy
[1:31:25] never ever get mad at the word where it
[1:31:27] leads you
[1:31:29] the very one that gathered them and the
[1:31:32] very anointing that actually made the
[1:31:34] mighty men though getting mad against
[1:31:36] lord why did you allow why
[1:31:38] david if you're really king and you
[1:31:40] really knew what was going on why on
[1:31:42] earth did you let our families be taken
[1:31:44] away by the amalekites
[1:31:47] we're going to kill yo don't get mad
[1:31:49] don't get mad at god where he leads you
[1:31:52] never ever have in your heart that that
[1:31:54] that you get mad at god
[1:31:56] god is always right he knows what we
[1:31:58] have need of
[1:31:59] amen he knows it doesn't matter how bad
[1:32:01] it may seem god knows what we need
[1:32:04] hallelujah
[1:32:06] amen amen but we know the rest of the
[1:32:08] story david encouraged himself in the
[1:32:10] lord
[1:32:11] and god told david you're going to
[1:32:13] recover all pursue and recover all and
[1:32:15] they recovered all
[1:32:16] amen but there were mighty men in that
[1:32:18] group that even the smallest desire of
[1:32:20] david because they're on david's side
[1:32:24] right the smallest desire of david was
[1:32:26] like a mighty commandment to them
[1:32:28] amen and david was was there and you
[1:32:30] know
[1:32:31] bethlehem was garrisoned and you know
[1:32:33] you know by the philistines and you know
[1:32:34] maybe he just looked and he saw his
[1:32:36] childhood home on the horizon and he
[1:32:39] just cried out oh i wish i could have a
[1:32:40] drink of that cold water of the well of
[1:32:42] bethlehem and there's three mighty men
[1:32:44] maybe they gathered around a fireplace
[1:32:45] or something they just heard it just
[1:32:46] came into their ears and they decided
[1:32:49] let's get our king a fresh drink
[1:32:51] we've got water here boys but he wants
[1:32:53] that water i mean they armed themselves
[1:32:55] they cut themselves through 15 miles of
[1:32:57] philistines amen and they got the water
[1:32:59] out of the well and they came back
[1:33:01] through 15 miles of philistines again
[1:33:03] and they gave their king a fresh drink i
[1:33:06] mean all because they're on david's side
[1:33:09] and that was a desire of his that he won
[1:33:11] that drink now we live in an hour
[1:33:14] where
[1:33:14] the pentecostal well
[1:33:17] of all the blessings of god
[1:33:19] have been walled up
[1:33:21] even even i could say if i could put it
[1:33:23] this way don't throw stones i'm not very
[1:33:25] fast but you know even within the
[1:33:27] message
[1:33:29] there's those unbelieving spirits
[1:33:31] garrisoned around the well
[1:33:34] where they want to just diminish the
[1:33:35] message down to formality
[1:33:38] and going through the motions and they
[1:33:40] won't say it but they basically said
[1:33:41] days of miracles have passed
[1:33:43] we don't need him anymore like that yes
[1:33:45] we do
[1:33:46] if we want to see the third paul
[1:33:48] manifested
[1:33:50] that's a supernatural move of god
[1:33:53] hallelujah if we want to see these
[1:33:55] bodies changed that's a supernatural
[1:33:57] move of god
[1:33:58] hallelujah and what is really you could
[1:34:01] say you'd say the change of the body is
[1:34:03] the greatest divine healing moment that
[1:34:06] has ever struck the earth
[1:34:08] and it's not just a temporary healing
[1:34:10] but it's actually a change of the atoms
[1:34:12] to that we put on immortality
[1:34:15] amen but he's still the jehovah of
[1:34:16] miracles he's still the god of miracles
[1:34:18] i mean so they cut their way through
[1:34:21] to get their king a fresh drink and the
[1:34:24] prophetess told us let us take our
[1:34:26] swords of the word
[1:34:28] let's chop through every superstition
[1:34:30] every formality every doubting spirit
[1:34:33] everything country to the word and let's
[1:34:35] get our king a fresh drink of
[1:34:37] pentecostal water a fresh worship amen
[1:34:40] that if we worship let's worship in the
[1:34:41] spirit if we sing let us sing in the
[1:34:43] spirit if we praise that it's praise in
[1:34:45] the spirit if we preach may we preach in
[1:34:47] the spirit if we play instruments maybe
[1:34:49] play in the spirit if we walk let us
[1:34:51] walk in the spirit if we talk to someone
[1:34:53] may we talk under their spirit under the
[1:34:55] anointing may every action we do be
[1:34:58] anointed by god
[1:34:59] amen so i think this 20 22 i mean let's
[1:35:02] get our king a fresh drink
[1:35:04] i mean let's give him a fish fresh
[1:35:06] worship
[1:35:07] not a formality and just taking things
[1:35:09] common i've heard this before been
[1:35:11] through this before no
[1:35:12] praise god amen you know you think
[1:35:16] there'll be a last time we can gather
[1:35:20] there'll be a last time
[1:35:22] what will cause that last time
[1:35:23] ultimately the rapture means we won't be
[1:35:25] in this building
[1:35:26] anymore we will have camp last time
[1:35:30] you'll have family altar last time
[1:35:33] you never many la i think by isaac said
[1:35:35] this can't remember but you know many
[1:35:36] times we never think it's our last time
[1:35:39] it just we just go through it then we
[1:35:40] look back and say oh that's at my last
[1:35:42] time
[1:35:43] doing whatever
[1:35:45] we should never ever take
[1:35:47] coming to church
[1:35:49] hearing the word even i'm thankful i
[1:35:52] have life in my body to praise god
[1:35:54] because the bible says shall the dead
[1:35:56] praise thee
[1:35:57] no they've gone on to their reward but i
[1:35:59] have life in my body to love him
[1:36:02] and worship him and give him praise
[1:36:04] irrespective of what's going on in my
[1:36:06] life because remember he's always good
[1:36:10] we shouldn't worship god we don't
[1:36:11] worship god based on our circumstances
[1:36:13] sure if he blesses us we thank him for
[1:36:15] it right but if we are down i mean
[1:36:17] praise him anyway he's still god he's
[1:36:20] still your savior he's still your
[1:36:21] redeemer he's still your bridegroom he's
[1:36:23] still all those things i mean your whole
[1:36:26] life falls apart he's still god
[1:36:28] amen the apostle paul was in prison with
[1:36:30] silas i said let's just have a let's
[1:36:32] have a testimony time
[1:36:34] i was going on the damascus road one day
[1:36:37] hallelujah in my heart was destruction
[1:36:40] but then a bright shining light came
[1:36:42] down from heaven i got thrown off my
[1:36:44] horse i cried out lord who are you i
[1:36:46] realize i'm seeing something that i read
[1:36:47] about in the scripture amen he said i'm
[1:36:50] jesus whom they'll persecute and my life
[1:36:52] has never been the same and silas could
[1:36:54] have given his testimony however they
[1:36:56] could have been talking about their trip
[1:36:57] reports what god had done in their lives
[1:36:59] and how great he is
[1:37:01] hallelujah
[1:37:02] and then they begin to sing
[1:37:04] all my life you have been faithful
[1:37:08] hallelujah and they're in a prison
[1:37:11] hallelujah
[1:37:13] don't look at your physical
[1:37:14] circumstances
[1:37:16] remember god does bless
[1:37:18] but a blessing doesn't you know a
[1:37:20] material blessing doesn't always mean
[1:37:21] he's pleased with you
[1:37:23] same way as being poor and death you
[1:37:24] doesn't mean he's unpleased with you
[1:37:26] right
[1:37:27] it's actually your spiritual condition
[1:37:30] that matters
[1:37:32] amen we're accepted in the beloved
[1:37:35] what because our lamb is accepted we're
[1:37:38] accepted
[1:37:39] amen because he is the perfect lamb that
[1:37:41] was offered on our behalf
[1:37:44] amen i'm accepted
[1:37:45] amen because he did that for me i can be
[1:37:47] on the lord's side
[1:37:50] hallelujah so they cut through all those
[1:37:52] philistines they got the king their king
[1:37:54] a fresh drink of water
