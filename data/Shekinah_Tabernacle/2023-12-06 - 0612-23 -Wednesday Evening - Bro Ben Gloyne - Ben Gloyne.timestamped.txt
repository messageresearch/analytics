[30:27] here um I'm going to read Galatians 2:
[30:30] 20 then we're going to go to uh uh Acts

[30:37] along um so Acts 2 uh sorry Galatians 2:
[30:42] 20 we'll get to acts soon amen this is I
[30:45] trust a very familiar piece of scripture
[30:47] to us all it says here I am crucified
[30:50] with Christ neveress I live yet not I
[30:53] but Christ liveth in me and the life
[30:55] which I now live in the flesh I I live
[30:57] by the faith of the Son of God who loved
[30:59] me and gave himself for me he says I do
[31:02] not frustrate the grace of God for if
[31:04] righteousness come by the law then
[31:06] Christ is dead in vain amen then we're
[31:09] going to go to acts 4 and then we're
[31:11] going to go
[31:12] to uh verse 23 I believe I have it
[31:16] here acts 4 and 23 then we're going to
[31:19] read down to uh verse
[31:21] 31 and
[31:23] um says here uh acts 4:23 and being
[31:27] ghost this is after the Sanhedrin has
[31:29] questioned them and so on uh they went
[31:31] to their own company and reported all
[31:32] that the chief priests and Elders had
[31:34] said un to said unto them and when they
[31:38] heard that they lifted up their voice to
[31:40] God with one Accord said Lord Thou Art
[31:42] God which has made Heaven and Earth and
[31:44] the Sea and all that in them is who by
[31:47] the mouth of thy servant David has said
[31:49] why do the Heathen rage and the people
[31:51] imagine vain things the kings of the
[31:54] earth stood up and the rulers were
[31:55] gathered to together against the Lord
[31:57] and against his Christ for of a truth
[32:00] against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou
[32:02] Hast anointed both Herod and Pontius
[32:04] Pilate with the Gentiles and the people
[32:05] of Israel were gathered together uh for
[32:09] uh for to do whatsoever thy hand or thy
[32:12] counsel determined before to be done and
[32:14] now Lord behold their threatenings and
[32:16] Grant unto thy servants that with all
[32:18] boldness uh they may speak Thy Word by
[32:22] stretching forth thine hand to heal and
[32:23] that signs and wonders may be done in
[32:25] the name of thy holy church all Jesus
[32:27] and when they had prayed the place was
[32:29] shaken where they were assembled
[32:31] together they're all filled with the
[32:32] Holy Ghost and they spake the word of
[32:34] God with boldness amen that's the first
[32:37] prayer meeting one of the first prayer
[32:38] meetings I pray we have a that kind of a
[32:40] prayer meeting we've been restored back
[32:41] to a book of Acts prayer meeting amen
[32:43] amen so let's just bow heads in a word
[32:45] of prayer amen this evening if you got a
[32:46] need you want to raise your hand to the
[32:48] Lord amen gracious father we want to
[32:50] thank you so much we can truly from our
[32:52] heart say we want you to stay Lord we
[32:55] want to be in your presence Lord we want
[32:56] to be very near where you are Lord we
[32:58] don't want to be at a distance from you
[33:00] father we want to be right next to you
[33:01] we want to want you to be in US Lord
[33:03] Jesus surround us father Lord we just
[33:05] want to pray there be nothing between
[33:07] our souls and our savior tonight Lord if
[33:09] there is anything I pray just be put
[33:11] under the blood father may you forgive
[33:12] us of all of our sins our trespass our
[33:14] iniquities Lord cleanse us even of our
[33:16] secret faults father and may just have
[33:19] your way in this service we're so
[33:20] thankful we can stand in Victory because
[33:21] you won US the victory that on Calvary
[33:24] and as we bow our heads we say Lord take
[33:26] the service under your Great Divine
[33:27] control may you anoint speaker and
[33:30] hearer Lord may you pray through us as
[33:33] well Lord and anyone who may be watching
[33:35] by the way of the stream I pray your
[33:36] presence would be with them as well
[33:37] minister to their lives too father we
[33:39] love you Lord and we thank you for this
[33:41] opportunity to praise and worship you in
[33:43] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[33:46] you friends you may you may have your
[33:48] seats uh tonight just want to take a
[33:50] couple of moments here uh just speaking
[33:52] about you know the goodness of our God
[33:55] now I'm so thankful that we can we can
[33:58] look into the book of Acts here and you
[34:00] know you know they had a bad day they
[34:01] had a real stressful day and we know
[34:03] we've come to the middle of a week and
[34:04] you there's a lot of things going on in
[34:06] life there's a busyness of life there's
[34:08] pressure of Christmas coming up and
[34:10] presents and family and Logistics and
[34:12] there's all these things that are going
[34:14] on in life there's pressure of this
[34:15] world and this laty and age we live in
[34:17] but yet we have a source of strength we
[34:19] can run to amen that that that that we
[34:22] can be filled because I'm so thankful
[34:25] that the life of God within us is
[34:27] greater than that of the world you know
[34:29] we are Overcomers in this age we're not
[34:31] just getting by or scraping through us
[34:32] we are Overcomers amen so so the spirit
[34:35] of God within us will overcome all
[34:37] things now brother Braham says this in
[34:39] in in the SM Church age here in the
[34:41] church age book he says as uh quoting
[34:44] the scripture be thou faithful unto
[34:46] death he does not say be faithful until
[34:49] death but unto death you may have to
[34:51] seal your testimony with your blood
[34:53] thousands y Millions have died during
[34:54] all the ages they died in the faith like
[34:57] Antipas a faithful martyr they held not
[35:00] their lives dear un death often we think
[35:02] it would be almost impossible to be a
[35:04] martyr but dare to recall that the faith
[35:06] we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus
[35:08] is the same faith that upholds the
[35:10] polycaps and all the martys the Supreme
[35:12] faith will give Supreme Grace for the
[35:14] Supreme hour blessed be God forever amen
[35:17] it's going to realize that we have a
[35:18] faith that's working mightily and we got
[35:20] to realize that as brother FY said on
[35:22] Sunday as God started with fire he's
[35:24] going to end with fire so how he started
[35:27] the church is how he's going to finish
[35:28] the church so if the church was filled
[35:30] with the Holy Ghost and the god came
[35:31] down and broke every shackle Every Chain
[35:33] every problem he'll do the same thing
[35:35] tonight amen cuz how he started is how
[35:37] he's going to finish I'm so thankful for
[35:39] that amen tonight now you know we think
[35:43] about the think about it where the
[35:44] Apostle Paul would say this you know
[35:46] that the life he now lives he lives by
[35:48] the faith of the Son of God so he you
[35:50] know you I know I've said this many
[35:51] times but it wasn't the the faith of the
[35:54] Apostle Paul he lived by anymore but it
[35:55] was the faith of God himself that was
[35:58] living in his life and he says I do not
[36:00] frustrate the grace of God now to
[36:02] frustrate it means uh just from the Thea
[36:06] Bible dictionary it says to do away with
[36:07] to set aside or disregard the Apostle
[36:10] Paul says I do not set aside the grace
[36:12] of God now we know Grace in The Bible in
[36:14] the New Testament means a Divine
[36:16] influence upon the heart and Its
[36:17] Reflection In The Life so he says I do
[36:19] not set aside God's Divine influence in
[36:22] my life I do not disregard it I do not
[36:24] nullify it or make it void or frustrate
[36:26] I do not reject it I do not refuse it
[36:28] amen it doesn't matter what I'm going
[36:29] through in life I embrace the grace of
[36:32] God Amen I embrace God's Divine
[36:34] influence I do not reject it because you
[36:36] know the Apostle Paul came to a place in
[36:38] his life he realized he was part of the
[36:40] word I mean he wasn't just a Pharisee
[36:42] learning the word he was part of that
[36:43] word he was actually prophecy manifested
[36:46] because because um it would say in the
[36:49] book of Isaiah that our lord Jesus would
[36:51] be a light I will also give the as a
[36:53] light for the Gentiles now I'm just I'm
[36:55] just jumping through these things so
[36:56] don't want to be uh caught up in reading
[36:58] but you can read it later in Isaiah 49
[37:01] they also give the light to the Gentiles
[37:03] now we know that this speaks of speaks
[37:05] of our Lord Jesus Christ as as I think
[37:07] even Paul himself would say that Christ
[37:09] should suffer and that he should be the
[37:11] first that should raise from the dead
[37:13] and should show light unto the people
[37:14] and to the Gentiles but then Paul
[37:16] himself even said that he was the fulf
[37:19] Fulfillment of that scripture it says
[37:21] for for so hath the Lord commanded us
[37:24] saying I will set thee to be light o to
[37:27] the Gentiles or of the Gentiles so Paul
[37:30] realized he was prophecy made flesh he
[37:32] was more than just a religious person it
[37:34] wasn't just part of his life it was his
[37:37] life it's all that way he was cuz his
[37:39] identity was wrapped up in the Lord it
[37:41] wasn't something he just he just decided
[37:43] to try for a season but he realized it
[37:45] was him it's who he was was the word and
[37:48] he realized that the life he was living
[37:50] was prophecy made manifest now we speak
[37:52] about predestination and we can throw it
[37:54] way into the deep end where where where
[37:56] it actually nullifies the power of God
[37:58] and that's what's happened down in every
[38:00] age where where the church has got
[38:01] bogged down to predestination they don't
[38:03] think they need to witness no more they
[38:05] think they don't need to pray no more
[38:07] they think they don't need to reach out
[38:08] in the spirit no more because whatever
[38:10] God's going to do he's going to do and
[38:11] whatever he's not going to do he's not
[38:13] going to do you you see it you know
[38:15] that's why that's why Wesley came with
[38:17] the Armenian Doctrine sure it wasn't imp
[38:19] Perfect Balance cuz he wasn't a prophet
[38:21] like in this last age but the church had
[38:22] g into Calvinism so much they had no
[38:25] burden for Missions they had no burden
[38:26] to outreach or just be a living witness
[38:29] because I thought well if you're
[38:30] predestinate you'll make it if not
[38:31] you'll not what you know that's it but
[38:33] you know God's program is tied with man
[38:36] and so God would use Wesley to swing the
[38:38] church back into a missionary fire and
[38:40] Zeal even just in their local area and
[38:43] we know brother Brown brought the right
[38:44] balance between Calvinism and Armenian
[38:46] ISM I'm not going into that tonight but
[38:48] he brought that perfect balance between
[38:50] it right because we know we're
[38:51] predestinated but really you should you
[38:54] should be living your predestination
[38:55] amen right the life you now live like
[38:57] Paul could have basically said I'm
[38:58] predestinated that's why God found me on
[39:00] the road to Damascus that's why he's
[39:02] transformed me that's why he's living in
[39:03] my life cuz Isaiah when he spoke of that
[39:06] prophecy he was actually speaking of me
[39:09] and here I am yeah and we should be able
[39:11] to say the same thing with the scripture
[39:13] what God spoke about a bride
[39:15] predestinated before the foundation of
[39:16] the world here I am and I'm living out
[39:19] that predestinated prophecy amen praise
[39:22] God Amen you know so so this is to me
[39:25] you know if I'm predes inated why not
[39:27] live it to all that you are why not give
[39:31] yourself to it you know if you're
[39:32] predestinated to be part of the word why
[39:35] why only give it part of your life why
[39:37] only give part of your life to Lord why
[39:38] don't you give your all you know you
[39:40] think about how you know you think about
[39:42] it like just say for example of years
[39:44] when I was maybe a child and I'd tell
[39:46] everyone I'm predestinated to marry
[39:48] Christine ruig and then I get old enough
[39:50] I can get married but I don't even start
[39:53] she doesn't know who I am you know I
[39:55] don't start cting her
[39:56] we don't get engaged we don't get
[39:58] married and maybe you time would go on
[40:00] go to my 40s 50s you know but I'm
[40:03] predestinated to marry you think hold on
[40:07] why don't you go marrier then you if
[40:09] you're saying you're boasting this is
[40:10] who you are this is what you meant to be
[40:12] why aren't you giving yourself to it
[40:14] letting it live you'd begin to question
[40:16] if I was really predestinated or not to
[40:18] do that right but see the thing is if it
[40:21] was really revealed to me which it was
[40:23] and here's a wedding band and she's got
[40:25] the wedding band
[40:26] praise God Amen Hallelujah well the rest
[40:29] is history right but you know but what
[40:31] kind of testimony would it be is oh the
[40:32] Lord told me I'm going to marry her and
[40:34] we're not even you know we don't even
[40:36] you know what I mean there's no wedding
[40:37] band on here it's not be it's not become
[40:40] living you'd be think what do you mean
[40:42] shouldn't you say yes and just jump into
[40:44] it and praise
[40:45] God now you take that into the spiritual
[40:47] realm prise the Lord you know we say
[40:49] we're predestinated why not live out
[40:51] your predestination because because the
[40:53] Bible says we pre we are predestinated
[40:56] to be conformed to His Image we are
[40:58] predestinated to overcome we are
[41:00] predestinated to go on a Rapture amen so
[41:02] why not live it out amen oh but you know
[41:05] I want to I want to do some other things
[41:06] first I wish I'd met God younger amen
[41:09] yeah I wish I was younger I wish when I
[41:12] was 11 I had a heart on my heart I
[41:14] wanted to meet God I wish I met him back
[41:17] then I was 22 or something when I
[41:19] finally met him went through all kind of
[41:20] Sorrows and pains and hardship and
[41:22] darkness the Lord can bring you out but
[41:24] it would have been good at 11 yeah I
[41:26] would have liked that more to know him
[41:27] through the teenage years for him to be
[41:30] my guide through all kinds of troubles
[41:31] and different things man that'd be
[41:33] awesome yeah yes that's right praise God
[41:37] Jesus amen you see
[41:41] on I'm just finding something
[41:44] here but you see what happens is people
[41:47] get in their mind they haven't sewed
[41:49] enough Wild Oats yet so they got to live
[41:52] life before they really serve God no
[41:54] serving God is living life
[41:57] he I I've come to give you life and life
[41:59] more abundantly I haven't come to give
[42:01] you a monastery kind of life with
[42:03] nothing in it just a stone cell and a
[42:05] window on a chair no no we got Abundant
[42:07] Life yeah we got the best kind of a life
[42:09] amen and I'm actually talking more
[42:11] spiritual than natural with that whole
[42:12] Al you know because who cares about
[42:14] natural riches it's going to be Vapor
[42:16] anyway you know but to know him endureth
[42:18] forever but people get in their mind
[42:19] that they haven't soed enough Wild Oats
[42:21] haven't lived life yet see there's
[42:23] something that they're lacking and I say
[42:24] that that that that lacking is the
[42:26] indwelling of the Holy Ghost that's
[42:28] right amen because God can anoint and
[42:30] you know we were actually driving was it
[42:32] today we were talking about it or I
[42:33] don't know where you know because people
[42:35] have this phrase oh they just were
[42:36] Anointed with the Holy Ghost hold on
[42:40] what do you mean just anointed by God
[42:42] people were just anointed praise God for
[42:44] the anointing we should never diminish
[42:46] anything God does for us we should never
[42:48] say oh people just shout at camp and
[42:50] that's it and that like like that's a
[42:52] bad thing praise God you got somewhere
[42:53] to shout if you shout in the in the the
[42:56] shower praise God you're shouting
[42:58] somewhere amen I'd rather be shouting
[43:00] somewhere and not anywhere right so
[43:02] people say oh they were just anointed
[43:04] what do you mean that was God who made
[43:05] heavens and earth came and anointed
[43:07] their Spirit started ministering to
[43:09] their lives and people say they were
[43:11] just anointed that's a that's an
[43:13] incredible thing amen praise the Lord
[43:15] you know because if he starts there well
[43:17] he can get into the soul he starts
[43:18] working he get into the soul you know we
[43:20] should we should we should treasure
[43:21] everything God does no matter how big or
[43:23] small that's all Stepping Stones that's
[43:26] stepping stones in the journey so praise
[43:27] the Lord so we should never ever speak
[43:29] negative about those kind of things we
[43:31] should treasure it say thank you God you
[43:33] know I'm always I know I probably get
[43:35] very emotional at Camp come Monday
[43:36] morning so I'm like thank you Lord you
[43:38] came this year again I don't take it for
[43:41] granted oh we're going to have camp and
[43:42] this is what's going to happen no God
[43:43] sovereignly says I'm coming too he could
[43:46] easily say no he's Sovereign you can't
[43:49] make him do anything he he chooses to
[43:50] say yes I'm going to be identified with
[43:53] those people I'm going to be identified
[43:54] with you I'm going to live in your life
[43:56] I'm proud of you I'm not ashamed of you
[43:58] and he and he and he and he joins
[44:00] himself to you know that's incredible
[44:02] amise the Lord praise the Lord amen so
[44:05] you know what we need like the disciples
[44:10] in Acts chapter 4 is a prayer meeting
[44:12] where God refills us with the holy
[44:14] spirit it's absolutely essential it will
[44:16] answer every question I'll say
[44:20] 9.99 problems out of 10 in life are
[44:22] answered by refilling of the Holy
[44:24] Ghost amen amen that is it is the cure
[44:27] for basically everything sure you can
[44:30] come and get a bit of guidance you have
[44:31] some questions sure that's all part of
[44:33] it we're happy to talk to you about
[44:34] anything but more of God answers
[44:36] basically everything amen because if we
[44:38] have less of God we become more caral if
[44:40] we have more of God we become more like
[44:42] him right so we can we can we can serve
[44:44] God in a greater way you know we really
[44:47] always want to stay with our source of
[44:49] strength we never want to be cut away
[44:51] from our source of strength I'm not
[44:53] going to ask for a show hands but how
[44:54] many people actually listen to the
[44:55] sermon of the week I hope you all say
[44:58] yes I do it's amazing Christian I
[45:00] talking about it if people just listen
[45:03] to that the answer that they asked us
[45:05] about for that week was already in that
[45:07] message and we just marvel at that they
[45:10] said what didn't you not hear that you
[45:12] know but see the devil wants to Cloud
[45:15] Our Lives over that we're not listening
[45:17] to the voice of the messenger we're not
[45:20] in the word this is our source of
[45:22] strength we're getting spiritual food I
[45:25] me gives us strength through the day
[45:26] amen gives us you know you hear the you
[45:28] hear the ministry of God there in the
[45:30] prophet the power of God moving it
[45:32] should raise an expectation Lord You're
[45:34] the same God as you were back there
[45:36] you're still alive today you can do the
[45:38] same things you can move in power we've
[45:40] seen him move in power but but we I'm
[45:42] expecting him to do far more than what
[45:44] he's already done you know we're not
[45:46] here just to say well it was good a year
[45:48] ago and now we just slump down and go
[45:49] through the motions no the Supernatural
[45:52] part of our life is the most important
[45:53] part amen we are Supernatural beings
[45:56] we're not natural beings we're not
[45:57] carnal beings we are supernatural beings
[46:00] and if you neglect the Supernatural part
[46:02] you neglect really all of your Victory
[46:04] all of your joy all of your peace you're
[46:06] basically frustrating the grace of God
[46:08] and throwing it aside but if you embrace
[46:10] it like the disciples see they didn't go
[46:12] to their they didn't go on trade me or
[46:14] someplace and and and and find some
[46:16] self-help book how to overcome
[46:18] pressure they didn't sit around and go
[46:21] on their Instagram feed and look at some
[46:23] nice motivational you know scriptures
[46:26] and they didn't look at those things and
[46:28] some power quotes and well that's fine
[46:30] but that wasn't their source of strength
[46:32] their source of strength was more than
[46:34] ink on paper or or pixels on a screen
[46:38] their source of strength with God
[46:40] himself that's why they had that prayer
[46:42] meeting is because they realized the
[46:44] devil had come against them right and
[46:46] that's why they cried out Lord You're
[46:48] God you made all things look at what
[46:50] they're doing and here we are we're in
[46:52] this need and God came and filled them
[46:55] gave them boldness that that what the
[46:57] devil is trying to put on their lives to
[46:59] to stop them living the Christian Life
[47:01] God just broke it off Hallelujah and
[47:03] they became stronger because of it amen
[47:06] that's why you know you're in a trial
[47:08] the devil's trying to stop your joy stop
[47:10] your witness it's actually God allowing
[47:12] that to make you stronger amen that you
[47:14] can actually God wants to use it as a
[47:16] testimony where you go to him say God
[47:18] the enem is against me you're God I need
[47:20] your help I'm just one of your children
[47:22] then God comes down breaks the Yoke of
[47:23] that thing and you begin to realize that
[47:26] mind battle where did that go where did
[47:28] that troubled feeling go where did that
[47:30] question go it just it just burnt out by
[47:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[47:37] hallelujah amen brother BR says I've
[47:40] seen men who took Alcoholics Anonymous
[47:42] and tried to make uh tried to be made
[47:45] well take shots take everything at all
[47:47] the psychology in the world and the best
[47:49] types of doctors that could have been
[47:51] gotten to give them treatment and fail
[47:53] now if you're not willing to take God's
[47:55] way go there that way yeah you need help
[47:57] people need help okay these things are
[47:59] to help but it's not the Cure right and
[48:02] I've seen that same man picked up by the
[48:04] blood of Jesus Christ and be made a
[48:06] saint of God and a preacher of the
[48:07] Gospel amen now if you think I'm a Holy
[48:09] Roller maybe I am right but if it takes
[48:12] the name of Holy Roller to find favor
[48:13] with Christ and be condemned by the
[48:15] world that I'm one of them that's right
[48:17] look I love him amen so so the the
[48:21] anointing of God breaks the Yoke of the
[48:22] enemy I mean the baptism of the Holy
[48:24] Ghost is the Cure All
[48:27] Hallelujah we have a silver bullet right
[48:31] we have the Cure amen some of you
[48:33] looking at me like what are you going on
[48:34] about but you know if you really meet
[48:37] God and realize if he did it for you
[48:39] then he can do it for you again remember
[48:41] they did not go there for have a prayer
[48:43] meeting to receive the Holy Ghost they
[48:44] already had the Holy Ghost they got in
[48:46] Acts chapter 2 but God refilled them to
[48:48] break every chain amen and we need a
[48:51] refilling of the Holy
[48:53] Ghost amen and we know that the pre
[48:55] predestinated will hear and make ready
[48:57] for the countdown brother says in the
[48:58] message the spoken words The Original
[49:00] Seed amen so if we're predestinated
[49:02] we're going to hear and be made ready
[49:04] that's why we that's why we hear the
[49:06] word that's why let the word change our
[49:08] lives it's because we're preparing for
[49:09] the countdown amen praise the Lord and
[49:12] we're living in that season right now
[49:13] are we
[49:15] not amen
[49:17] hallelujah praise the Lord but you see
[49:21] everyone wants to you know this world is
[49:23] full of
[49:24] substitutes fake sh
[49:26] fake meat fake everything it's a
[49:29] substitute of the
[49:30] original and that's the same thing with
[49:32] the word of God people want to
[49:34] substitute something well you know for
[49:37] the word it won't do what it says you
[49:40] know I won't go into that I'll just
[49:42] leave it alone but you know the fake
[49:43] stuff is not the same as the real stuff
[49:45] they say it does the same thing it's not
[49:47] anyway now otherwise I'm going to go a
[49:49] food tangent I don't feel like talking
[49:51] about food right now now how are you
[49:52] going to substitute something for the
[49:54] word of God and still say you're led by

[50:35] life Hallelujah Lord amen now brother
[50:38] Bram says that he's speaking of the
[50:42] church you know the Bram Tabernacle he
[50:45] says he says they need a refilling of
[50:47] the Holy Ghost this is what we need as
[50:50] well oh yes okay he's saying here now I
[50:52] see some of the Tabernacle folks here
[50:54] I'm going to say this about the the big
[50:55] sister so obviously he's not a Braham
[50:57] Tabernacle right here he says one thing
[50:58] that the Tabernacle needs up there at
[51:00] our church at the Tabernacle at Jeff is
[51:02] a rededication and a and a refilling of
[51:05] the Holy Ghost right everyone get down
[51:07] to the Altar and pray until they get a
[51:09] renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole
[51:10] church be filled with the power of God
[51:12] that's what we need not only the
[51:14] Tabernacle here but the body of Christ
[51:16] Universal it needs a refilling David
[51:19] said one day restore to me the joy of my
[51:21] salvation now he had not lost his
[51:23] salvation but the joy of it and when it
[51:25] comes to place I can't enjoy my religion
[51:27] my salvation cuz there's something wrong
[51:29] somewhere because it's joy unspeakable
[51:31] full of Glory one see taste and see the
[51:33] Lord is good the it tastes like Honey in
[51:35] the Rock oh I'm so glad I tasted that
[51:37] the Lord is good and I love honey but I
[51:40] never tasted any like that that's the
[51:42] best that I know so if we come to a spot
[51:45] where we can't enjoy our religion we
[51:47] can't we can't enjoy our Salvation
[51:49] what's happened the devil's put
[51:51] something on us that we stop enjoying it
[51:53] I that's why we need a refilling
[51:55] of the Holy Ghost because you get into
[51:57] his presence once again he refills you
[51:59] what happens The Joy comes back the
[52:01] bubbling stream starts gushing like
[52:03] never before and you can enjoy your
[52:05] religion your salvation better than when
[52:07] you first met him hallelujah amen why
[52:10] because he keeps it fresh amen now
[52:12] brother Braham now I've got I got two
[52:14] minutes now brother Braham says now he's
[52:15] speaking about when he crossed a log one
[52:17] day hunting and it was a big old log a
[52:19] big big old beach log it was laying in a
[52:21] stream and it looked big and strong but
[52:23] when he stood on it bits fell off of it
[52:25] and it became soft and doy because it
[52:27] was dead in that stream of life and he
[52:30] said now that's the same thing what
[52:32] happens you know with a Believer amen if
[52:35] if if the Life of Christ ever goes from
[52:37] them they'll be they'll be in the Stream
[52:39] of life but they'll rot twice as quick
[52:41] and he says to overcome is to keep life
[52:44] in you if you want to know how to
[52:45] overcome in this life keep the life of
[52:47] God in you keep it around you keep him
[52:49] around you don't do nothing to grieve
[52:51] him away I mean don't do nothing that's
[52:52] contrary to his word you keep him around
[52:54] you and you'll overcome yeah praise God
[52:58] Amen because remember if you think about
[52:59] that tree if that tree was alive it
[53:01] would probably be growing more than the
[53:02] ones around it because it's right in the
[53:03] Stream of life amen and we don't want to
[53:05] be sitting in church riding twice as
[53:07] quick because we've G the spirit of God
[53:09] from us he say well I'm predestinated
[53:11] but do you but do you want to dodge a
[53:12] trial do you want to dodge a bad you
[53:14] know premise of will of
[53:16] God oh brother Andy's the only one I'm
[53:20] glad you want to stand in the perfect
[53:21] will my brother but you see we don't
[53:23] want to go down into the permissive will
[53:24] of God we want to stay in the perfect
[53:26] will of God and if we stay fully
[53:28] surrendered to his word you'll stay in
[53:30] the perfect will amen amen if you don't
[53:32] lean to your flesh lean to what other
[53:33] people say lean to what's going on in
[53:36] culture leaning trying to fit in then
[53:38] you will stay in the perfect will of
[53:39] godj Amen so this is what we need to do
[53:41] if you want to overcome keep life in you
[53:44] keep the spirit of God in you keep that
[53:45] sweetness in your heart keep that love
[53:47] you know that you know that you know
[53:48] that new you know that first love
[53:49] everything the world looks different
[53:51] everyone's wonderful even your greatest
[53:53] enemy you love them you want them to see
[53:54] them make make the Rapture you know
[53:56] you'll do anything for them you know
[53:57] that love keep that feeling in you
[54:00] whatever you do because brother Ram says
[54:02] that anointing comes around there's a
[54:03] real sweetness can come with it amen so
[54:06] keep life in you now I'm going to finish
[54:08] with this the Dynamics of this church
[54:11] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[54:13] that we have worked in a small measure
[54:15] while The Headstone is coming down to
[54:17] unite with the body that's happening
[54:18] right now but when that hidden body
[54:20] unites together the full power of the
[54:21] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[54:23] exactly like that even the Dead that's
[54:25] dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago
[54:27] will raise in the beauty of his Holiness
[54:28] and take the flight to the skies the
[54:30] Dynamics is the holy spirit amen so he
[54:34] says the Dynamics of this church will be
[54:36] a refilling of the holy spirit amen but
[54:39] it'll be a greater measure than what is
[54:41] been in the past that's why we need the
[54:43] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to move in
[54:45] our lives not just in church but
[54:46] individually amen the power of God will
[54:48] move in a greater way cuz that is what
[54:50] it will
[54:51] take to leave this world am amen but I'm
[54:56] so thankful we're been restored back to
[54:58] the original Faith where it happens amen
