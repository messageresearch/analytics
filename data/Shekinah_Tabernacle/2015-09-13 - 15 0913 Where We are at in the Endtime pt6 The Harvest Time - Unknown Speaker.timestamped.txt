[37:20] reminder but
[37:22] um if you'd like to go to Matthew
[37:25] Chapter 13 with me
[37:27] I want to uh yeah I'm I want to continue
[37:30] really where we're going where where we
[37:31] are at the end time uh I want to just
[37:34] leave the uh Genesis 24 just for a brief
[37:37] just just for a service but I I want to
[37:39] uh look into you know there's a uh yeah
[37:43] we'll read here the parable of the weed
[37:45] and the tears we just so in Matthew 13
[37:48] and we'll start from verse 24 we'll just
[37:50] take the
[37:53] um uh we'll just take this here from 24
[37:55] down to verse verse 30 CU we're in a
[37:58] gathering age and some you we'll be
[38:02] gathered somewhere we'll all be gathered
[38:05] somewhere doesn't matter how young or
[38:07] old we are we're going to be gathered
[38:08] somewhere so another Parable he put
[38:11] forth unto them saying the Kingdom of
[38:13] Heaven is liken unto a man which SED
[38:15] good seed in his field but while men
[38:18] slept his enemies came and sowed tears
[38:20] among the wheat and went his way but
[38:22] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[38:24] forth fruit then appeared the tears also
[38:26] Al so the Servants of the householder
[38:29] came and said unto him sir did thou not
[38:31] so good seed in thy field from whence
[38:34] then hath it tears and he said unto them
[38:36] an enemy has done this the servants said
[38:40] unto him wil thou then that we go and
[38:44] gather them up but he said nay least
[38:47] while we gather up the tears ye root up
[38:49] also the wheat with them let them grow
[38:52] together until the Harvest and in the
[38:54] time of harvest I will say to to the
[38:56] Reapers Gather ye together first the
[38:59] tears and bind them in bundles to burn
[39:01] them but gather the wheat into my B may
[39:04] the Lord bless his word you may be
[39:06] seated
[39:07] so um is that slideshow Brother Andy is
[39:10] that is that up and running uh yeah just
[39:13] the just warming up okay that's fine we
[39:16] don't really need it too soon um so
[39:19] we've been speaking of of you from
[39:21] Genesis 24 because we see there's a
[39:23] uniting there with with with re
[39:27] and alaza where God you alaza was was
[39:30] sent to get a bride for Isaac and we and
[39:32] we've seen very plainly in the scripture
[39:35] that that um you know we are that we are
[39:38] that Rebecca we are we are living out
[39:40] what what she lived as a shadow we are
[39:42] living out in its fullness and we have
[39:44] heard we have heard the alas of call
[39:46] there's no doubt about it that God is so
[39:48] vind God over Vindicated this message to
[39:51] cause the elect to see this is me doing
[39:53] it this is not William brandham doing it
[39:55] this is me doing it and and and he
[39:57] Vindicated it so much that you would
[39:59] know this is God speaking in an age
[40:01] where there's a multitude of voices and
[40:03] everyone has an opinion God has sent
[40:06] it's not his opinion it is thus sayith
[40:08] the Lord into the Earth that we can know
[40:10] this is God speaking and so we just read
[40:13] this here but I just want to I just put
[40:14] this emphasis on this here notice he
[40:16] says now he says but gather together
[40:19] first the tears and bind them in bundles
[40:22] to burn them but gather the weed into my
[40:24] Bon so we have seen that the true sign
[40:27] of the end time is where as the bride
[40:29] and Christ have become one that is the
[40:31] true sign of the end time but then
[40:33] there's also uh this Parable uh Jesus is
[40:37] saying here that first the tears must be
[40:39] bound for the burning and then but he
[40:42] says but gather the wheed into my bone
[40:45] and now so there's only one bone and we
[40:47] know that is Christ and that ultimate
[40:49] Gathering will be the meeting in the a
[40:51] that is the ultimate Gathering of the
[40:52] wheat but we see that first the tears
[40:55] must be bound
[40:57] and we can see he says here he says but
[40:59] in the um he says uh up here he
[41:04] says um wait I um I saw it in the script
[41:07] he says but let them grow together verse
[41:09] 30 until the until the Harvest and in
[41:12] the time of the Harvest I'll say to the
[41:14] Reapers now gather them and so we're in
[41:16] this we're in this harvest season so I
[41:19] don't know if this is going to work or
[41:20] not now I just want to go into this
[41:23] because prophecy th this scripture is is
[41:26] is being fulfilled right in front of us
[41:29] in this day and hour and and this is
[41:31] from the UN website I just want to show
[41:32] you that that the there's a squeeze that
[41:35] is coming that has already been
[41:36] happening for many years upon Israel but
[41:38] now what's happening is that Israel is
[41:41] is is being forced slowly and slowly
[41:43] they're being strangled until eventually
[41:45] they have to sign an agreement with the
[41:47] Vatican and then we understand by
[41:49] Daniel's propety uh uh uh prophecy that
[41:52] in the midst of the Great Tribulation
[41:54] now the vatican's going to break the
[41:55] deal and they're going to betray them
[41:57] and all these things are going to happen
[41:58] but there's a slow squeeze upon Israel
[42:01] that they'll find eventually the only
[42:03] way out now is to sign sign up with a
[42:05] very enemy that hates them the ancient
[42:07] enemy of the church is is that beast
[42:09] power and they have to actually sign an
[42:12] agreement with them just to survive so
[42:14] this is this is from the UN um UN
[42:17] website so the state of Palestinian flag
[42:20] is to flight the United Nation
[42:21] headquarters at Geneva um this is a
[42:24] adopting a resolution on the non-member
[42:26] Observer States and the only two
[42:29] non-member states in the UN is the
[42:30] Vatican and the Palestinian territories
[42:33] so this is just an excerpt from this I
[42:35] can send you the link he says in a
[42:36] discussion that began before the
[42:38] adoption and continued afterwards
[42:40] delegates considered various aspects of
[42:42] the resolution calling it a historic
[42:44] vote The Observer of the State of
[42:47] Palestine said that the general assembly
[42:49] had sent an important message to the
[42:51] Palestinian people at at a critical time
[42:54] while raising the flag would not end the
[42:56] OCC would not in the occupa this is the
[42:58] UN website raising and but they quoting
[43:01] this guy but but they're obviously
[43:02] supporting what he's saying he's saying
[43:04] raising the flag would not end the
[43:06] occupation so they're saying that Israel
[43:08] is occupying
[43:09] Palestine it would signify to the
[43:12] Palestinian people everywhere that the
[43:13] international community supported them
[43:17] because what happens is Israel is a part
[43:19] of the UN it's a it's a recognized
[43:22] country but the Palestinians are not a
[43:24] recognized Country and so what is moving
[43:27] towards now is that the Palestinians
[43:29] eventually will get statehood recognized
[43:32] by the UN this is what's going on and
[43:34] now when they and when they uh receive
[43:38] statehood they're on equal footing now
[43:40] with Israel and so what happens now is
[43:43] the UN they you know the Palestinians
[43:46] are trying to force the Israelis to go
[43:49] back to the borders that were before the
[43:51] 1967 war they you know there's a big
[43:54] push we want Israel must go back to the
[43:57] pr67 W you know borders because the UN
[44:00] acknowledged those borders you see so
[44:03] now when when the when the Palestinians
[44:06] get statehood there'll be a push now
[44:08] they must restore those original borders
[44:11] right and the only ones holding up the
[44:13] whole thing will be
[44:14] Israel you see so Israel it's been a you
[44:18] know it's been around for a while Israel
[44:20] is the one holding up peace that's how
[44:22] the world projects it Israel's it's not
[44:25] Palestinian it's it's Israel's the
[44:27] problem you see and this is fulfilling
[44:30] so this is just a map now the so in the
[44:32] pink is the countes that recognize the
[44:35] state of
[44:37] Palestine it's most of the world it's 60
[44:41] it's basically 70% of the members of the
[44:44] United Nations recognize the state of
[44:48] Israel yeah and the Vatican recognized
[44:51] them as a state recently as well so it's
[44:54] already a majority now recognize
[44:57] Palestine is a should be a
[44:59] state yeah now remember the reason why
[45:03] there's this big turf war going on in
[45:06] the promised land is because God said to
[45:08] the Jews I give you the land I'm going
[45:10] to restore there's a prophecy maybe
[45:12] let's just go to Hosea chapter 6 and
[45:14] we're just going to read a
[45:16] prophecy there's this prophecy
[45:20] here what I'm I'm basically showing you
[45:23] this is where we are in the end time
[45:24] this is this is current event
[45:26] remember modern events are made clear by
[45:28] the prophecy so everything you see on
[45:30] the world stage is made clear by the
[45:32] prophecy that's right amen and that's
[45:34] why God had to send a Vindicated voice
[45:36] in this end time that we could know
[45:38] exactly what's going on you know I saw
[45:41] this clip on YouTube just a little bit
[45:43] last night I can't remember the Bible
[45:45] teacher's name but he was taking
[45:46] Revelations 11 and he said the two
[45:48] witnesses were the Old and New Testament
[45:50] and he said they are raid and sat cloth
[45:52] because it was under martydom and
[45:54] hardship you know that the Reformation
[45:56] came forth that was his and people were
[45:58] just swallowing it up I thought thank
[46:00] God for a voice thank God for Elijah to
[46:04] come amen and rebuild the altar so we
[46:06] can really worship God hallelujah thank
[46:09] you Lord amen otherwise we'd be
[46:11] staggering in
[46:12] darkness amen so Hosea chapter 6 and
[46:15] verse
[46:16] 1 says come and let us return unto the
[46:19] Lord for he has torn and he will heal us
[46:23] he has smitten and he will bind us after
[46:25] two days will he revive us and the third
[46:28] day he will raise us up and we shall
[46:30] live in his sight now this was written
[46:33] over this was written in BC 780
[46:36] according to my Bible and we know a day
[46:39] with the Lord is a thousand years so
[46:41] saying in the third day he will you he
[46:44] says after two days he will revive us
[46:46] and the third day he will raise us up
[46:48] and we shall live in his sight and you
[46:50] see that these last you know recently
[46:53] you know you go back 200 years they
[46:55] begin to to be a ground swell of this we
[46:57] must return to our homeland speaking of
[46:59] the Jews there's a Zionist movement you
[47:01] know we must have a state of Israel
[47:03] what's happening this scripture now cuz
[47:05] this is over this is in the third 3,000
[47:08] year you see where we are now you
[47:10] following me so this scripture is being
[47:13] fulfilled where a people he says Let Us
[47:16] return come let us return unto the Lord
[47:19] and remember the only way that Israel
[47:20] can really have fellowship with God is
[47:22] if they're in the promised land you know
[47:24] God always deal here always dealt with
[47:26] Abraham in the promised land he always
[47:28] deals with the Jews cuz that's their
[47:29] inheritance just like the only way God
[47:31] can deal with us is if we're in our
[47:33] inheritance if we're in Christ amen our
[47:35] Wilderness Journey God can do Mighty
[47:37] things for us but it's when we cross the
[47:39] Jordan when and that Jordan is a death
[47:41] the self if you're willing to die I mean
[47:44] to go into your inheritance that's where
[47:46] God really wants to speak to you and so
[47:48] God now he's so this is this scripture
[47:51] this day the scripture is being
[47:52] fulfilled amen so if this is now the
[47:56] prophecy of God saying that the people
[47:58] will be stirred and they will return to
[47:59] their land then Satan is going to do
[48:01] everything he can to dislodge the people
[48:04] and he's going to try and invalidate
[48:06] their right to be there right you see so
[48:09] this big Turf War now is as we have you
[48:11] know Ishmael and Isaac you know their
[48:14] their lineages are fighting fighting it
[48:16] out to see who really the promised land
[48:18] belongs to it belongs to Isaac's people
[48:20] whether the world will recognize it or
[48:22] not it is it is the Jewish people they
[48:24] have a right to be there and so we have
[48:28] this big you know we have this big stir
[48:30] going on and the reason that the UN is
[48:34] is jumping on the bandwagon is because
[48:36] the UN you know this is not conspiracy
[48:39] theory we'll read in the Book of
[48:41] Revelation the last World power the only
[48:44] world power there is is is the Vatican
[48:48] it's in the scripture the last willpower
[48:51] there is is the Vatican so they are
[48:53] governing world
[48:54] events so whatever the UN is trying to
[48:57] do it is working towards their ends amen
[49:00] is working towards what they want and we
[49:03] also have if we go to Daniel chap
[49:06] 11 we'll just read the last part of
[49:08] Daniel chapter 11 because Daniel chap 11
[49:11] he you know Daniel
[49:13] sees in a slightly greater detail really
[49:17] what is what is happening down from from
[49:20] uh you know you see Alexander the Great
[49:22] in there and it continues on down it
[49:24] continues on down into this into this
[49:26] end
[49:27] time and the because the Catholic Church
[49:31] they know they started in Jerusalem they
[49:33] want Jerusalem Rome is not their
[49:36] original place but they believe and they
[49:38] they recognize their Homeland is really
[49:40] Jerusalem so they want the holy sites
[49:43] they want to control the holy sites
[49:44] there in Israel and we can see this here
[49:47] in in Daniel 11 if we go just to the
[49:49] last verse of Daniel 11 because it's
[49:52] quite a long verse and there's many many
[49:54] things that are spoken about
[49:56] about um
[49:58] but now we'll just read the last last uh
[50:03] last two verses here but this is
[50:05] speaking about the so it goes from if
[50:07] you read Daniel 11 in the start of the
[50:09] verse it speaks about Darius the me and
[50:12] then it speaks about the king that you
[50:14] know he stir up the realm of Greece
[50:16] Grecia which is Alexander the Great and
[50:19] then so so so this is placed in time and
[50:21] then it's from then and then how
[50:23] Alexander the Great's Kingdom splits up
[50:25] it continues all the way down into the
[50:27] end time this is this chapter so if we
[50:31] come down to the end of the chapter so
[50:33] verse 44 but but Tidings out of the East
[50:35] and out of the North shall trouble him
[50:38] therefore um he shall go forth with
[50:40] great Fury to destroy into Ally to make
[50:43] uh to make away many he shall plant the
[50:47] Tabernacles of his Palace so this is
[50:48] this speaking of this beast power he
[50:51] shall plant the Tabernacles of his
[50:53] Palace between the Seas and the glorious
[50:56] holy
[50:57] mountain now where's that there's only
[50:59] one glorious holy mountain I mean that's
[51:01] in Israel yeah there's only one Holy
[51:04] Mountain that's recognized in the Bible
[51:05] which is which is in Israel yet he shall
[51:09] come to his end and None Shall help him
[51:11] so this is his end goal he wants the
[51:14] pope you know that whole be system wants
[51:16] to set themselves up there in Israel
[51:18] they want the holy places and we can see
[51:21] this here that it says he shall plant
[51:23] the Tabernacle of his Palace between the
[51:25] SE in the glorious holy mountain so he's
[51:27] going to achieve it in some way yeah now
[51:31] how does he how does he how does he work
[51:32] that out he turns the world against
[51:35] Israel and he squeezes them so they have
[51:38] to give in to
[51:42] survive now
[51:44] so and then also we have this scripture
[51:46] here in Zechariah Chapter 12 because
[51:48] this is being
[51:50] fulfilled the burden of the word of the
[51:52] Lord for Israel sayith the Lord who
[51:54] stretched forth the heavens and layth
[51:56] the foundation of the earth and forth
[51:57] the spirit of man within him behold I'll
[51:59] make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto
[52:01] all the people round about when they
[52:03] shall be in The Siege both against Judah
[52:06] and against Jerusalem now you think of a
[52:09] Siege you think of walls you think of
[52:12] Defense yeah now when I now this is just
[52:16] me have they not built walls in Israel
[52:19] to keep the Palestinians out are they
[52:22] not being attacked from Gaza and Rockets
[52:24] being fired
[52:27] what does that constitute it's a Siege
[52:29] to me it's a Siege amen the enemy said
[52:33] as you know cuz it's not a a Siege as as
[52:36] as as you lay you know you surround your
[52:38] enemy and you don't just do it all out
[52:40] of salt but gradually you fire something
[52:42] in you try and wear him down and you try
[52:44] to find his weak points they dig tunnels
[52:47] under they do all kinds of things it's a
[52:49] Siege they' built Jerusalem y Israel's
[52:53] put walls up like they never have before
[52:54] to separate at the West Bank and all
[52:56] these
[52:57] things now that's just me but that's how
[52:59] I see it I might be wrong but that's how
[53:01] I see it that behold now and in that day
[53:05] I'll make Jerusalem a burdensome stone
[53:07] for all people all that burden
[53:10] themselves with it shall be cut in
[53:11] pieces though all the people of the
[53:13] Earth shall be gathered together what
[53:15] against it this scripture is being
[53:18] fulfilled this has been being fulfilled
[53:20] for a long time amen Jerusalem is a bir
[53:25] burden every president I must make peace
[53:27] we must make peace it's a burden to the
[53:30] whole world how can we answer the the
[53:32] the problem you know there in the Middle
[53:34] East it's not Isis and all these things
[53:37] that the world really cares about it's
[53:39] Israel and Jerusalem and the
[53:41] Palestinians and you know this is the
[53:44] burden that the world
[53:46] has and it says all it says a burnis
[53:50] some stone for all
[53:52] people you look at this country they've
[53:55] got got a seat in the security Council
[53:56] in the UN what do they want to try and
[53:59] fix they want to try and fix this it's
[54:02] and we're on the other side of the earth
[54:04] you know not even it doesn't really
[54:06] affect us but it's become a
[54:08] burden amen the word of the Lord is
[54:11] perfect amen this is what's going on the
[54:14] whole Jerusalem is a
[54:17] burden
[54:19] now there's a gathering going on this is
[54:23] all part of the Gathering
[54:25] now what I now let's just go to
[54:28] Revelations chapter 13 just
[54:30] quickly because I want to read a few
[54:32] things here and then I'm going to show
[54:33] you how it's been lived out I'm going to
[54:35] show you how it's been lived out because
[54:37] it's incredible when you when you look
[54:39] at the you know from from you know from
[54:41] missusa Street and then around the same
[54:44] time you have you have you know you have
[54:47] brother Bam's commissioned take the gift
[54:50] of healing to the Earth Elijah is being
[54:52] commissioned by the angel of the Lord to
[54:54] basically go out attract the attention
[54:57] of the bride and begin to gather the
[54:58] bride then you have the World Council of
[55:00] churches really has its first meeting
[55:02] and then you have the uh you have a you
[55:05] have
[55:06] Israel for the first time for over 2,000
[55:09] years they declared themselves a
[55:11] Sovereign Nation all at the end of the
[55:14] all at the end of the 1940s all these
[55:16] same events are going on and it's it's
[55:19] very significant because in the time of
[55:22] the Harvest he says I'll bind the tears
[55:25] first for the burning but then I'll
[55:27] gather the wheat and so he sends he
[55:29] sends Elijah now to gather the
[55:32] wheat and he stirs up he stirs up Europe
[55:36] now and brother baram and maybe we say
[55:40] it too easily but he says that the
[55:42] Holocaust and World War II was the
[55:45] tender hand of Jehovah to drive the Jews
[55:48] back into their Homeland and we
[55:50] understand from reading the seals that
[55:52] that all those Jews that died on the
[55:54] Holocaust were give white robes amen
[55:57] think of it amen but Prophet says it's
[56:00] the tender hand of
[56:02] Jehovah you Tred telling that to people
[56:04] who who survived that thing and still
[56:07] have the still have the you the uh you
[56:10] know the uh number and stuff you know
[56:11] they prison of it try telling that to
[56:13] one of those Jews it was just a tender
[56:15] hand of your God that caused all this to
[56:16] happen that's what the prophet said it
[56:18] was so you have now this is all
[56:20] happening to drive the Jews back into
[56:22] their Homeland because out of those ones
[56:25] and out of the others that will come
[56:27] later 144,000 of them are going to be
[56:30] gathered that's why that's why the
[56:32] Devils roaring against that place is
[56:34] because he knows in the scripture
[56:36] there's 144,000 elected Jews they're
[56:39] going to receive the same God that we
[56:41] know am Hallelujah and they and they're
[56:43] going to be there and they have to be
[56:45] there so the devil tries all he can to
[56:47] try and stop that being fulfilled and so
[56:49] we have that going on you have the World
[56:51] Council of
[56:52] churches forming itself and we'll read
[56:55] in the scripture that that thing is the
[57:00] vehicle and America is the
[57:03] vehicle that the devil uses to swing the
[57:06] whole of the Christian
[57:08] Christendom into into Rome again swings
[57:12] the whole thing back in and then you
[57:15] have Elijah that's come to call out
[57:16] elected bride amen hallelujah all these
[57:19] things are sent to the Earth at the same
[57:21] time scriptures being fulfilled it's
[57:24] incredible amen amen so let's just go I
[57:26] want to Glory Hallelujah now just to
[57:29] save time thank you just to save time
[57:32] I'm sure you're familiar all all with
[57:33] this but Revelations 13: 1 down to verse
[57:38] 10 but let's just read this let's just
[57:40] go through it just just just very
[57:43] quickly remember this is all
[57:45] symbolic and this first part of this
[57:47] chapter is speaking of of this Roman
[57:49] power and Daniel sees it when he sees
[57:52] the four creatures and the last creature
[57:55] was the most diverse as the others it
[57:56] was part of all of the first three were
[57:59] merged into the fourth one and this was
[58:01] the world power the Roman power and that
[58:04] is the only will power to the time of
[58:06] the end and John sees the same creature
[58:08] now and I stood upon the sand of the
[58:12] sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the
[58:15] sea now remember the sea we we
[58:18] understand from The Book of Revelation
[58:19] it's peoples multitudes tongues and
[58:21] Nations so this power is raising up out
[58:24] of a populated part of the earth which
[58:27] we understand is Europe having seven
[58:29] heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10
[58:32] crowns and upon his heads the names of
[58:35] blasphemy or yeah and the Beast which I
[58:38] saw was like now was like unto a leopard
[58:42] and his feet were like the feet of a
[58:44] bear and his mouth is the mouth of a
[58:46] lion now if you go back into Daniel when
[58:50] you read about the first three world
[58:52] powers one's a lion one's a leopard and
[58:55] one's a bear that's the anointings is
[58:57] what they look like so this fourth one
[58:59] is a bit of all that mixed together and
[59:01] his mouth his mouth of a lion and the
[59:03] dragon gave him his power and his seat
[59:07] and great Authority say the Devil
[59:08] Himself giving this power giving this
[59:11] thing his power and his seat and his
[59:13] great Authority this last World
[59:15] system and I saw one of his heads as it
[59:19] were wounded to death and his deadly
[59:21] wound was healed and all the world
[59:23] wandered after to the Beast now this
[59:26] happened when Pagan Rome changed to
[59:30] paple Rome yeah and if you go on to
[59:32] church history we have emperor
[59:33] Constantine is about to come to a very
[59:36] important battle and he has a Visionary
[59:38] dream of of a cross he says with this
[59:41] sign you shall conquer and he told the
[59:43] soldiers to paint the paint the symbol
[59:45] on his Shi on their Shields they won the
[59:48] battle and then what happened is after
[59:50] that because he was a political man and
[59:52] what was happening is Christianity was
[59:54] Rising up in his Empire and was causing
[59:56] great Strife between the old religions
[59:58] and the new what he did is he made a
[1:00:00] compromise and he took he took parts of
[1:00:03] Christianity and he took the Pagan old
[1:00:05] worship and he merged them together to
[1:00:07] make the people happy that's why we we
[1:00:11] celebrate Christmas on the 25th of
[1:00:14] December which is the shortest day in
[1:00:17] the your your shortest day in the
[1:00:19] northern hemisphere it's the son God's
[1:00:22] birthday traditionally but now it's the
[1:00:24] done of God's birthday so and Easter and
[1:00:27] all these different things they just
[1:00:29] they just took the Pagan Traditions
[1:00:32] rebranded them it's still the same thing
[1:00:34] and then just gave it to the people and
[1:00:36] they were happy that's why you have
[1:00:37] father son Holy Ghost three gods and the
[1:00:40] Pagan Traditions were more than one God
[1:00:43] polytheism
[1:00:44] yeah and so he did that now politically
[1:00:48] to to keep power in his Empire and
[1:00:51] that's when the p i Pagan Rome like the
[1:00:54] Roman Empire the legion you you the
[1:00:56] legions and all these things they would
[1:00:58] changed now so now instead of a physical
[1:01:00] power in that way it was a religious
[1:01:02] power but it was still the world power
[1:01:04] at the end and then you can see from
[1:01:06] then on you can see the Pope the
[1:01:08] Catholic church was driving you know
[1:01:11] driving politics in
[1:01:13] Europe that's why you see you know you
[1:01:15] go back you go back in the Reformation
[1:01:17] days the Cardinals were like the most
[1:01:19] powerful man in a country yeah and they
[1:01:22] were they were like the Prime Minister
[1:01:24] yeah they were a prime minister in a
[1:01:26] country that's like Henry VII he had to
[1:01:28] kill his Cardinal you know to do
[1:01:30] whatever he wanted to do marry more
[1:01:32] wives and all these different things
[1:01:33] that power had to be broken yeah imagine
[1:01:37] that if if you know a prime minister of
[1:01:40] a country is really working for someone
[1:01:42] else his first Allegiance isn't to the
[1:01:44] country isn't to the king it's to
[1:01:46] another guy he's not going to he's going
[1:01:49] to he's pushing he's pushing an
[1:01:51] influence on an agenda which is not the
[1:01:52] king's agenda that's Rome's agenda you
[1:01:56] see and so this power was changed
[1:01:58] now and it says and they worshiped the
[1:02:01] dragon which gave power unto the Beast
[1:02:04] and they worshiped the Beast saying who
[1:02:06] is like unto the Beast who is able to
[1:02:08] make war with him and you can see in you
[1:02:11] you can see in world history you can see
[1:02:14] you know when the Ottoman Empire was
[1:02:16] coming up and all these different things
[1:02:17] and the and the you know there was the
[1:02:19] Holy League of the of the Protestants
[1:02:22] and the Catholics came together to fight
[1:02:24] the Ottoman Empire they you know Ottoman
[1:02:26] Empire was going to take Vienna which is
[1:02:28] a very important city in Europe and they
[1:02:31] and they broke the siege they defeated
[1:02:32] the Ottomans they pushed them back
[1:02:34] ultimately they could say who could make
[1:02:36] war with this
[1:02:37] power no one could make war with
[1:02:40] it amen you can see how you know he he
[1:02:44] began to govern The Whole World's
[1:02:49] events now and there was given unto him
[1:02:52] a mouth speaking great things and
[1:02:53] blasphemies and power was given onto him
[1:02:55] to continue 40 and2 months and he opened
[1:02:58] his mouth and blessed me against God to
[1:03:00] blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle
[1:03:02] and then that dwell in heaven I'm just
[1:03:04] I'm just skipping over a lot of these
[1:03:06] things but and it was given unto him to
[1:03:07] make war with the Saints and to overcome
[1:03:09] them and the power was given unto him
[1:03:12] over all kindreds and tongues and
[1:03:14] Nations now these Saints here maybe we
[1:03:16] just drop this in but but these saints
[1:03:18] that he had he was given to make war
[1:03:20] with the Saints and to overcome them
[1:03:22] that is remember a Saints is a
[1:03:24] Sanctified one someone who's come to
[1:03:27] sanctification is a saint it doesn't
[1:03:29] mean their Spirit fill so the so the
[1:03:32] ones so the right you know the fullest
[1:03:35] virgin that goes into the tribulation
[1:03:37] they are Saints yeah but they didn't
[1:03:41] have oil in their lamps they didn't have
[1:03:42] the Holy Ghost in them in their vessels
[1:03:45] to be taken into the wedding
[1:03:47] supper y they didn't have they were
[1:03:49] Sanctified like the you know the foolish
[1:03:52] virgin the only difference between the
[1:03:53] foolish virgin and the wise virgin was
[1:03:55] that one had oil one had really partaken
[1:03:59] of the rivers of life one one actually
[1:04:02] already one was thirsting the fullest
[1:04:05] version was still thirsting the Wise One
[1:04:07] know Jesus said out of you will flow
[1:04:10] rivers of Living Water so there was
[1:04:13] there was a life being lived being
[1:04:15] poured out of the wives that the foolish
[1:04:17] didn't
[1:04:18] have amen this gospel is a life of power
[1:04:23] amen amen it is a life of power and
[1:04:26] there's something when when you come and
[1:04:28] you really meet him you don't thirst
[1:04:31] like you did before you were you know
[1:04:33] before you ever met him you thirsted you
[1:04:36] hungry you looking for something and
[1:04:39] that's why you know people I ended up in
[1:04:41] a barro I ended up making home I ended
[1:04:43] up playing all kinds of video games and
[1:04:45] watching all kinds of movies and
[1:04:47] listening to all kinds of music and all
[1:04:48] kinds of sports and all these things cuz
[1:04:50] I was thirsty yeah but one day I met
[1:04:53] Jesus Glory all those things died
[1:04:55] Hallelujah and now I don't thirst like
[1:04:57] that anymore but there's people you
[1:04:59] could sit even here this morning and
[1:05:01] still thirst amen quench that thirst
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:06] hallelujah that's right and so the ones
[1:05:08] that really have become one with him
[1:05:10] have the oil they're going up amen but
[1:05:13] the ones who don't have the oil they're
[1:05:14] staying here that's right and that's why
[1:05:16] it says now that the it was given to him
[1:05:19] to make war with the Saints and to
[1:05:21] overcome them because um let's just jump
[1:05:25] back into the Book of Daniel I want to
[1:05:27] show you that there's these two groups
[1:05:29] here because we do
[1:05:31] not you know this tribulation that
[1:05:34] everyone is worried about the bride
[1:05:37] doesn't see it in its fullness we begin
[1:05:39] to feel its effect sure but we you know
[1:05:42] we're out of here
[1:05:44] hallelujah now Daniel chapter
[1:05:48] 7 em we read
[1:05:53] here
[1:05:57] now'll find it he says here let's just
[1:06:01] start reading from verse
[1:06:03] 9 I beheld to the Thrones were cast down
[1:06:05] the Ancient of Days did sit whose
[1:06:07] garments were white as snow and the hair
[1:06:09] of his head was was like pure wool his
[1:06:12] throne was like the fiery flame and his
[1:06:14] wheels as burning fire a fiery stream
[1:06:17] issued and came forth from before him
[1:06:20] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[1:06:22] that's the bride and 10,000 time 10,000
[1:06:25] stood before him the Judgment was set
[1:06:26] and the books are open and I beheld then
[1:06:29] because the voice of the great words
[1:06:31] which the horn spake which is the enemy
[1:06:33] I beheld even till the Beast was slain
[1:06:35] and his body destroyed and given to the
[1:06:38] Burning Flame as concering the rest of
[1:06:40] the Beast they had their Dominion taken
[1:06:42] away yet their lives were prolonged for
[1:06:44] a season in a
[1:06:46] time
[1:06:53] now uh yes here so we go down to verse
[1:06:55] 18 now he says uh let's just read from
[1:06:59] verse 15 we'll just read it I Daniel was
[1:07:01] grieved in my spirit in the midst of my
[1:07:03] body and the vision of my head troubled
[1:07:05] me I came near unto one of them that
[1:07:07] stood by I asked the truth of all this
[1:07:09] so he told me to made me know the
[1:07:11] interpretation of the things these great
[1:07:14] beasts which are four are Four Kings
[1:07:16] which shall rise out of the earth now
[1:07:18] watch this but the Saints of the most
[1:07:20] high shall take the kingdom and possess
[1:07:23] the kingdom forever even forever so
[1:07:25] that's one group then I would know the
[1:07:28] truth of the fourth Beast which is
[1:07:29] diverse from all the others exceedingly
[1:07:32] Dreadful whose teeth were of iron his
[1:07:34] nails of brass which devoured break in
[1:07:36] pieces and stamped the residue with his
[1:07:38] feet and of the 10 horns which were in
[1:07:41] his head and of the other which came up
[1:07:43] and before whom three fell even of that
[1:07:46] horn that had eyes and a mouth that
[1:07:48] spake very great things those look was
[1:07:51] more Stout than his fellows now that's
[1:07:54] that is describing what we read in
[1:07:56] Revelations 13 okay so don't just just
[1:07:58] just stick with me and I beheld and the
[1:08:01] same horn made war with the Saints and
[1:08:04] prevailed against them until the Ancient
[1:08:06] of Days came and judgment was given to
[1:08:08] the Saints of the most high and the time
[1:08:11] came that the Saints possessed the
[1:08:13] Kingdom so there's one group here we
[1:08:15] read in verse 18 but the Saints of the
[1:08:17] most high shall take the kingdom and
[1:08:19] possess the kingdom forever even even
[1:08:21] forever but then there's another group
[1:08:23] here where that same horn made's war
[1:08:26] with the Saints and prevailed against
[1:08:27] them how can that
[1:08:29] be well what it is basically it is it is
[1:08:32] the the ones in verse 18 is the bride
[1:08:34] that goes up and the ones now here we
[1:08:38] have in verse
[1:08:40] 21 and then verse 22 is the great white
[1:08:42] Throne judgment they receed the kingdom
[1:08:45] after the great white Throne judgment
[1:08:47] because before that this beast power
[1:08:49] makes war with them and overcomes them
[1:08:52] that's the foolish virsion going into to
[1:08:53] the tribulation are you're following me
[1:08:56] so so there's the two groups are
[1:08:57] described them
[1:09:00] now and then even if we go down to verse
[1:09:03] 25 you know he's speaking of the same
[1:09:05] thing and he shall speak great words
[1:09:08] against the most high and wear out the
[1:09:10] Saints of the most high and think to
[1:09:12] change times and laws that they shall be
[1:09:14] given into his hand into a time and a
[1:09:16] times and a dividing a time but the
[1:09:19] Judgment shall sit and they shall take
[1:09:20] away his dominion and consume and to
[1:09:22] destroy it until the end
[1:09:24] and the kingdom and dominion and the
[1:09:25] greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole
[1:09:27] Heaven shall be given to the people of
[1:09:29] the Saints of the most high whose
[1:09:31] kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and
[1:09:32] all Dominion Shall Serve and Obey him so
[1:09:36] again this is repeated it says that this
[1:09:38] this power will make war against yeah he
[1:09:42] shall wear out the Saints of the most
[1:09:43] high and think that change times and
[1:09:46] laws and they shall be given into his
[1:09:48] hand until a time and times and a
[1:09:51] dividing of time so time is one times is
[1:09:53] two dividing time is a half it's three
[1:09:55] and a half years so so during that Great
[1:09:58] Tribulation time he'll He he'll he'll
[1:10:00] change everything like this amen yeah
[1:10:04] right so
[1:10:06] now this so the bride hey the bride
[1:10:09] that's why I Rejoice the bride goes up
[1:10:11] we don't see these things hallelujah
[1:10:14] thank you Lord amen now let's just go if
[1:10:16] if you still got Revelations 13 handy
[1:10:18] we'll just go back there because I want
[1:10:19] to go into these slides but I need to
[1:10:20] lay this to show you that these events
[1:10:23] that I've just picked up uh uh very
[1:10:26] significant because it's prophecy being
[1:10:28] fulfilled you know people are thinking
[1:10:31] well we've got to see certain things
[1:10:33] happen and this has got to happen first
[1:10:34] and it's already happened we are we are
[1:10:37] so at the end friends we are right we
[1:10:39] are right there amen
[1:10:42] hallelujah amen so
[1:10:45] now
[1:10:47] um uh uh so eight so so verse eight of
[1:10:50] of Revelation 13 and all that dwell upon
[1:10:52] the Earth shall worship her who's that
[1:10:54] the Beast the dragon whose names are not
[1:10:56] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[1:10:58] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:11:00] if any man have an ear let him here do G
[1:11:03] he says all that's a lot of people you
[1:11:05] think seven billion upon the Earth he
[1:11:07] says all whose names are not written the
[1:11:09] land's Book of Life shall worship him
[1:11:12] right well will they all become Catholic
[1:11:14] no they don't need to become Catholic
[1:11:16] they don't even need to become
[1:11:17] Christians right amen this this enemy is
[1:11:21] a multi-headed Hydra
[1:11:24] right amen and its head can be religion
[1:11:27] its head can be Sports its head can be
[1:11:29] Hollywood it head can be your job its
[1:11:32] head can be just wanting your know Home
[1:11:36] Improvement right whatever your God
[1:11:38] whatever you make as a God you can trace
[1:11:40] that that's not Christ you can trace it
[1:11:42] back to that beast power right
[1:11:44] hallelujah amen amen so you don't just
[1:11:47] look at the head of the thing you say
[1:11:48] what is driving that thing what drives
[1:11:51] people to be so busy and want to just
[1:11:53] you know Home Improvement and wanting to
[1:11:55] be I need a new car I need a b a car I
[1:11:57] need a bigger house I need to I I want

[1:12:01] they strive and they give themselves and

[1:12:05] nothing evil with wanting a new car and
[1:12:07] wanting a bigger house and wanting to go
[1:12:08] on holiday all those things are

[1:12:25] becomes first in your
[1:12:27] life that is that is that is the problem
[1:12:30] nothing wrong with playing Sport and
[1:12:31] kicking a ball around whatever but when
[1:12:33] it becomes first in your
[1:12:36] life I think I've told this before but
[1:12:38] I'll tell it again when I was seven you
[1:12:41] know I loved cricket cricket cricket was
[1:12:43] me before I got into sailing cricket was

[1:13:07] Morrison and Martin Crow and all these
[1:13:08] great ones I wanted to bowl like Danny
[1:13:11] Morrison Hallelujah this is me I was but
[1:13:14] I was caught up and now my heroes had
[1:13:17] been defeated and my life was
[1:13:21] over you think that's silly not to a
[1:13:23] seven-year-old boy it's not
[1:13:25] silly but you see men grows up and they
[1:13:29] still that seven-year-old boy and they
[1:13:32] still worship the god of sports nothing
[1:13:34] wrong with sport play sport but when it
[1:13:37] becomes first
[1:13:39] place it's bad it's wrong it's
[1:13:42] evil amen so now it says that all shall
[1:13:47] worship
[1:13:49] Him people say how do I know I'm
[1:13:51] predestinated what are you worshiping
[1:13:55] it doesn't say them that are written on
[1:13:56] the Lamb's Book of Life shall worship
[1:13:58] him those who are not
[1:14:01] written when that Prophet stood here and
[1:14:03] he preached preached you know when the
[1:14:05] lamb took the
[1:14:07] book and then he began to preach with

[1:14:13] of redemption that was taken you're part
[1:14:15] of that book all the names of the
[1:14:17] elected ones are in that book and then
[1:14:19] so when when the lamb took the book and
[1:14:22] was given to a prophet to to break the
[1:14:23] mysteries of God to a
[1:14:25] people he was by preaching those sermons
[1:14:28] now he was calling the names in the book

[1:14:36] search thing that's that's not that it's
[1:14:40] it's when something in you says that's
[1:14:41] me amen this message is for me he's
[1:14:44] called me out what is that that's God
[1:14:47] calling your name I want God to speak to
[1:14:50] me if if this message has spoken to you
[1:14:52] like nothing else
[1:14:54] that is God calling your name and that
[1:14:56] proves your names in the book amen amen

[1:15:01] wedding supper is so many people whether
[1:15:03] we like or not there's places and
[1:15:05] there's names just like you go to a
[1:15:07] feast someone who's on to it they they
[1:15:09] they place the guests and you know like
[1:15:11] you have a wedding reception there

[1:15:24] Lamb there's names there's names there
[1:15:27] and everyone has to be there whose name
[1:15:29] is there am and that's why God sent God
[1:15:31] sent the friend of the bridegroom that
[1:15:33] was revealing the bridegroom so he sent
[1:15:36] an alasar and he had the he had the
[1:15:38] reception list he had the ones who were
[1:15:40] meant to be there amen and he and he and
[1:15:43] he and the Word was open and he began to
[1:15:46] preach he's preaching the the the
[1:15:49] invitation glory and then you heard that
[1:15:51] invitation because your name's on the
[1:15:53] register am me your name's in the book

[1:15:57] say yes that's me because your name's
[1:16:00] been called out of the book Glory
[1:16:02] hallelujah amen and that's why it says
[1:16:04] that only those who are not written in
[1:16:07] the Book of Life shall worship Him amen
[1:16:11] that's why we're the most privileged
[1:16:12] people hallelujah amen amen sorry I got
[1:16:16] to stay up my subject here amen now we
[1:16:19] go down here if any man have an ear let
[1:16:21] him here he that leadth into captivity
[1:16:23] shall go into captivity he that kill us
[1:16:25] with the sword must be killed with the
[1:16:26] sword here is the patience and the faith
[1:16:28] of the Saints now we have another we
[1:16:31] have another character coming upon the
[1:16:32] scene now and I beheld another Beast
[1:16:35] coming out of the earth so not out of
[1:16:37] the sea out of the Earth this is a place
[1:16:39] where there's not a great multitude of
[1:16:41] people there's a power coming out of the
[1:16:43] earth and he had two um out of the earth
[1:16:46] and he had two horns like a lamb and he
[1:16:49] spake as a dragon now this is a world
[1:16:52] power coming on the scene
[1:16:54] and this so a lamb is is freedom of
[1:16:56] religion amen pure religion so when
[1:16:59] America was founded the Puritans founded
[1:17:01] America and they came to flee the
[1:17:04] persecution that was going on in the old
[1:17:05] world and they came to the new because
[1:17:07] they wanted freedom of of worship and
[1:17:10] that's what America was founded upon
[1:17:12] freedom of worship and so that power
[1:17:14] came out of the so sure the Native
[1:17:16] Americans were there but they Wen it
[1:17:18] wasn't a great densely popular place
[1:17:20] like Europe was amen so came out of the
[1:17:23] Earth where there's not many people and
[1:17:25] you notice here now he had two horns
[1:17:28] which is ecclesiastical and and and
[1:17:30] civil kind of power like a lamb and he
[1:17:33] spake as a dragon now we understand when
[1:17:35] a lamb is born he doesn't have
[1:17:38] horns I've never you know I've you know
[1:17:41] I've helped friends dock lamb tals
[1:17:44] hundreds of them I never saw one with
[1:17:46] horns because it's just a baby but when
[1:17:49] it grows into an adult Ram then it's
[1:17:52] when the horns grow
[1:17:56] amen so we've seen America is over what
[1:17:59] 200 odd years I don't know how old but
[1:18:01] but it's a mature
[1:18:02] country amen even though it hasn't been
[1:18:05] here relatively that long it's a mature
[1:18:07] country it has history it has culture it
[1:18:10] has
[1:18:10] identity amen so it's a mature country
[1:18:15] so it says now he had two horns like a
[1:18:17] lamb so he's not speaking of a just a
[1:18:19] baby lamb anymore but it's a it's a ram
[1:18:22] it's a a mature a mature power you
[1:18:26] following me he says when he has these
[1:18:29] now he had two horns like a lamb and he
[1:18:32] spake as a
[1:18:33] dragon so he's not speaking so to speak
[1:18:36] as someone it's I'm I'm repeating what's
[1:18:39] already been spoken yeah so if I want to
[1:18:42] speak as Andy I just quote Andy I'm
[1:18:45] speaking as Andy you see so now for him
[1:18:48] to speak as a dragon it's not a lamb
[1:18:51] speaking anymore but he's repeating what
[1:18:53] a dragon is saying yeah that's right yep
[1:18:56] he is repeating what a dragon is saying
[1:18:59] he's repeating what the Vatican is
[1:19:02] saying you go back a 100 years you I
[1:19:04] think it was yeah I might be wrong on
[1:19:06] the name but I think it was Teddy
[1:19:08] Roosevelt he went to go see the pope but
[1:19:11] he was told when you see the pope you
[1:19:13] got to kiss his ring and you got to
[1:19:14] basically bow down he says no it's off
[1:19:17] they would never they would never have
[1:19:20] you know they would never have audiences
[1:19:22] like they do and like they're about to
[1:19:23] have later this month with with the Pope
[1:19:27] going to America 100 years ago would
[1:19:29] never have happened right would never
[1:19:30] have happen and so it's only been since
[1:19:33] see Kennedy came in and brother Ram says
[1:19:36] this this country is going to make the
[1:19:37] greatest mistake it's ever made by
[1:19:39] voting in a Catholic President and they
[1:19:42] made that mistake so now what happened
[1:19:44] is that enemy power that they fled to
[1:19:47] find to to found that country they've
[1:19:49] married themselves back into it by
[1:19:51] actually placing it in charge of the
[1:19:53] whole country you take the Supreme Court
[1:19:57] they're either Catholic judges or the
[1:20:00] Jewish there's no Protestants on the
[1:20:02] Supreme Court anymore and a Supreme
[1:20:04] Court Judge is there basically till he
[1:20:06] drops
[1:20:07] dead and they write the laws they they
[1:20:10] you know they're the Supreme that's the
[1:20:12] Supreme Judicial System of the whole
[1:20:14] country and it's Jewish or
[1:20:18] Catholic amen this is prophet and he
[1:20:20] spake as a dragon well how does all this
[1:20:23] has to come into place for now for him
[1:20:25] to speak as the
[1:20:28] dragon you know and then you see you
[1:20:30] know you
[1:20:31] take uh you know you take the you know
[1:20:34] the last elections both vice presidents
[1:20:36] were Catholic people there's all this
[1:20:38] going on all the Mexicans coming in
[1:20:40] Catholic
[1:20:41] people all this going on what's
[1:20:44] Happening Catholicism has Taking Over
[1:20:47] America amen this scripture is being
[1:20:51] fulfilled you may never recognize y oh
[1:20:53] when's this all going to happen it's
[1:20:54] already happened the hour is a lot later
[1:20:57] than we we think and it says now and he
[1:21:00] excises all the power of the first Beast
[1:21:02] before him and cause the Earth and them
[1:21:06] that dwell therein to worship the first
[1:21:08] Beast whose deadly wound was healed so
[1:21:11] this power now the the intent of this
[1:21:14] power now is to cause everyone to come
[1:21:17] back to the Vatican and worship
[1:21:20] it and he did great wonders so he maketh
[1:21:22] Fire come down from heaven on the earth
[1:21:24] and the sight of
[1:21:25] men and
[1:21:27] he and he deceiveth them that dwell on
[1:21:30] the Earth by the means of those Miracles
[1:21:32] which he have power to do in the side of
[1:21:34] the Beast saying to them that dwell on
[1:21:36] the earth that they should make an image
[1:21:38] to the Beast which had the wound by a
[1:21:40] sword and did live so now this power is
[1:21:44] instrumental because this image to the
[1:21:45] Beast that is the World Council of
[1:21:47] churches that's what it is in the
[1:21:49] scripture and so this F so this Beast is
[1:21:52] actually instrumental now and causing
[1:21:55] this thing to be formed this image to
[1:21:56] the Beast that all the world now would
[1:21:59] be gathered back into
[1:22:02] Rome
[1:22:04] Hallelujah I say praise the Lord because
[1:22:06] this word must be fulfilled am fulfill
[1:22:08] your word oh God that's all I say amen
[1:22:11] and he had power to give life unto the
[1:22:13] image of the Beast that the image of the
[1:22:15] Beast should both speak and cause as
[1:22:17] many as should not worship the image of
[1:22:19] the Beast should be killed then remember
[1:22:22] that's in the Great Tribulation and he
[1:22:25] causeth all both small and great rich
[1:22:27] and poor free and bond to receive a mark
[1:22:29] in their right hand or in their
[1:22:31] foreheads and that no man might buy or
[1:22:34] sell save he that had the Mark or the
[1:22:35] name of the Beast or the number of his
[1:22:37] name here is W
[1:22:39] wisdom excuse me let that ha
[1:22:43] understanding count the number of the
[1:22:44] Beast for it is the number of a man and
[1:22:46] his number is is 603
[1:22:49] sc6 now so he's saying here that he so
[1:22:52] this image now would cause the people to
[1:22:54] receive a mark in their hand right hand
[1:22:56] or their forehead now in the in the in
[1:22:58] the Book of Revelation those who are
[1:23:00] sealed with the Holy Ghost is sealed in
[1:23:02] their forehead so what this is now is
[1:23:04] your hand to be marked in your hand is
[1:23:06] what you do and in your forehead is your
[1:23:10] Doctrine amen so so people can be sealed
[1:23:13] either way they can give to it
[1:23:14] sympathize with it or they can be take
[1:23:17] false religion and be marked that
[1:23:20] way now we go back the time of isusa
[1:23:24] Street America and the Vatican were PS
[1:23:28] apart but then there's been a great and
[1:23:30] the World Council churches wasn't even
[1:23:32] here and now there's been a great big
[1:23:34] shift where all have come together and
[1:23:35] this scripture is being being lived out
[1:23:39] and so what happens now is there has to
[1:23:41] be because remember when when the Book
[1:23:43] of Revelations in chapter 17 it calls it
[1:23:46] calls Rome says it says that she's the
[1:23:49] mother of harlots this this church
[1:23:51] system is a mother so it's got children
[1:23:54] it's got it's got It's got daughter
[1:23:58] denominations so what has to happen now
[1:24:00] is that all these ones remember it's a
[1:24:02] binding the tears have to be bound so
[1:24:04] there has to be a gathering now of mom
[1:24:06] and daughters have to be gathered all
[1:24:08] back together so there has to be a
[1:24:10] vehicle now that that Satan uses to
[1:24:12] swing the people back into
[1:24:15] row now this begin to happen when
[1:24:17] brother remember Elijah when Elijah was
[1:24:19] upon the Earth you know Jezebel was
[1:24:22] trying to bind the people under a de
[1:24:24] Bale worship and then so there was there
[1:24:27] was this was going on but Elijah was
[1:24:29] trying to you know that's reason he
[1:24:31] called the Mount Caramel Showdown is the
[1:24:33] people would come out of that thing and
[1:24:34] they would worship the true and living
[1:24:36] God and then so you come now and this
[1:24:39] man this is this is David David johanes
[1:24:41] Jus or however you say it he's a South
[1:24:44] African born Pentecostal Minister
[1:24:45] brother Brown speaks of this man he is
[1:24:48] considered one of the main founders of
[1:24:49] the charismatic movement in which the
[1:24:52] Pentecostal experience by baptism with
[1:24:54] the Holy Spirit spread to
[1:24:55] non-pentecostal churches worldwide so
[1:24:58] now there's okay jup entitled his
[1:25:00] autobiography the spirit made me go as
[1:25:03] he believed God had commanded him to
[1:25:05] take the Pentecostal message to other
[1:25:06] denominations and in particular the
[1:25:08] World Council of churches recounting a
[1:25:11] meeting with 24 ecumenical leaders in
[1:25:13] Connecticut dupus wrote this is his
[1:25:15] words I could remember days when I wish
[1:25:18] I would have set my eyes upon such a men
[1:25:21] to denounce their the ology and pray the
[1:25:23] Judgment of God was upon them for what I
[1:25:25] considered their heresies and false
[1:25:26] doctrines after a few intro um
[1:25:29] introductory words I suddenly felt a
[1:25:31] warm glow come over me I knew this was
[1:25:34] the Holy Spirit taking over but what was
[1:25:37] he doing to me instead of a old harsh
[1:25:39] Spirit of criticism and condemnation of
[1:25:41] my heart I now felt such a love and
[1:25:44] compassion for these ecclesiastical
[1:25:45] leaders that I'd rather have died for
[1:25:48] them than past sentence upon them now
[1:25:52] he's a contemporary of brother Bram
[1:25:54] brother bram's Ministry it says in
[1:25:57] Revelations 18 W it says now he says I
[1:26:00] heard another voice he says and there
[1:26:03] after these things I saw another Angel
[1:26:04] come down from heaven having great power
[1:26:07] and the Earth was lighted with his glory
[1:26:09] and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:26:11] voice saying Babylon the great has
[1:26:13] fallen has fallen and has become the
[1:26:15] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:26:17] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:26:19] unclean and hateful birth for all
[1:26:21] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[1:26:23] wrath of her fornication and the kings
[1:26:25] of the Earth have committed fornication
[1:26:26] with her and the merchants of the Earth
[1:26:28] are wax Rich through the abundance of
[1:26:30] her Delicacies and I heard another voice
[1:26:32] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[1:26:33] people that ye be not partakers of her
[1:26:35] sins and that you receive not her
[1:26:38] plagues so there's a voice that has come
[1:26:40] upon the Earth is that they calling out
[1:26:42] say come out of her so that is the call
[1:26:44] of the Hour come out of these religions
[1:26:46] and come into Christ that you be not you
[1:26:49] know that you are not burnt with her
[1:26:51] basically but then now here's another
[1:26:53] man who's actually once he was against
[1:26:56] once he was against that kind of thing
[1:26:58] ecumenical moves but then something
[1:27:01] happens to him at this meeting where his
[1:27:03] whole his whole outlook has changed he's
[1:27:05] saying now they're my
[1:27:07] brothers that's not that is not that is
[1:27:10] not God if a Vindicator voice says come
[1:27:13] out of her my people and another voice
[1:27:15] says bind in with them which one are you
[1:27:17] going to
[1:27:19] take amen so this man was was called Mr
[1:27:23] Pentecost and he after this now he swung
[1:27:27] the whole church into Babylon he swung
[1:27:31] the Pentecostal move into
[1:27:34] Babylon what's happening tears are being
[1:27:37] bound
[1:27:40] Hallelujah tears are being bound that's
[1:27:43] right see if he really had love and
[1:27:46] compassion for them he would have said
[1:27:47] come out of that stuff forsake that
[1:27:49] stuff and come into Christ that's what
[1:27:51] he would have told them cuz that's what
[1:27:52] love and compassion does is don't go
[1:27:54] that way that ways death but his eternal
[1:27:56] life receive it amen that's that is hey
[1:27:59] if you want to get scratchy get scratchy
[1:28:01] I mean go fishing throw out something if
[1:28:03] people nibble give them a bit more if
[1:28:06] they don't nibble just just let it go
[1:28:09] how can I tell them just throw out
[1:28:11] something throw something out and see
[1:28:13] what happens and and if there's a
[1:28:14] response throw out a bit
[1:28:18] more you don't have to give them the
[1:28:19] whole thing just a little bit by little
[1:28:21] bit
[1:28:22] hey Jesus you know with the woman at the
[1:28:24] well he didn't say he didn't immediately
[1:28:26] say I'm the Messiah yeah they talked
[1:28:28] about the wells and real worship you

[1:28:33] says he that speaks to thee am he you
[1:28:35] know I that speak to the am he so so so
[1:28:37] he started just just give me a drink and
[1:28:40] then the conversation went on he didn't
[1:28:42] throw it all out there in the initial
[1:28:44] statement that's right he just laid he
[1:28:46] just gave it a little bit then she
[1:28:48] responded then he responded again then
[1:28:50] she responded then finally it came came
[1:28:52] down and he he revealed who he

[1:29:05] then a little bit more and just see and
[1:29:07] just see how they respond to it
[1:29:10] amen now so he now this is this is
[1:29:15] Brother bar speaking the souls are in
[1:29:16] prison he say see what happened here a
[1:29:19] week ago in the city the Faith Lutheran
[1:29:21] minister invited the Catholic priest of
[1:29:23] the Sacred Heart to come up and preach
[1:29:25] for him and he did and the Faith
[1:29:26] Lutheran minister went down to the
[1:29:28] Catholic priest and preached for him now
[1:29:32] remember the lutherans came out of the
[1:29:33] Catholic church amen and Martin Luther
[1:29:36] didn't want to start a new church he
[1:29:38] wanted to fix the one he's in and then
[1:29:40] because they wouldn't change they kicked
[1:29:41] him out and so he had to start something
[1:29:44] new so this would never have happened
[1:29:46] this you know Martin Luther would be
[1:29:48] rolling in his grave if he saw what the
[1:29:50] lutherans had done
[1:29:52] yeah amen right and then um the Council
[1:29:57] of churches over here now that's meeting
[1:29:59] in Rome this circular letter that my
[1:30:01] good friend David dupus when I sat there
[1:30:04] and cried to him about in 40 Mile Creek
[1:30:06] not long ago not realizing he swung the
[1:30:09] church right into Babylon wow when
[1:30:12] everybody's saying oh all the churches
[1:30:13] are going to be one now yeah I know that
[1:30:16] just exactly that's wrote in my book of
[1:30:17] Prophecy 1933 it would take place why
[1:30:20] don't you realize that Satan uniting
[1:30:23] together the Bible says that and after a
[1:30:25] little bit just after a while as soon as
[1:30:27] they become one then the inter
[1:30:29] denominational finished see there'll be
[1:30:31] your mark of the beast rise see see he's
[1:30:34] saying these things because this David
[1:30:36] youus this is this was in um this was
[1:30:41] before 1963 when he had this meeting
[1:30:44] yeah and then so he was swinging the
[1:30:46] people and then so and then and then a
[1:30:47] sermon after this brother R said I
[1:30:49] shouldn't have called his name he says
[1:30:50] normally I don't call names and he said
[1:30:51] I'm sorry I didn't mean to call but he's
[1:30:53] saying he he was so grieved because he
[1:30:55] didn't realize that he'd swung the
[1:30:57] church right into Babylon remember the
[1:30:59] image will cause the whole world to
[1:31:02] worship the
[1:31:04] Beast and now so this is
[1:31:06] him this is
[1:31:08] davidus this is Pope John the uh Pope
[1:31:11] Paul the 6 and some various delegates
[1:31:14] and so on and this was this was I think
[1:31:17] in the early 70s and what happened was
[1:31:19] is that in the SE I think other the late
[1:31:22] 60s or early 70s is the pope asked David
[1:31:26] dupus now to start a Interfaith dialogue
[1:31:29] with the Pentecostals even more and so
[1:31:31] the Vatican actually used him as a
[1:31:33] vehicle to swing the church under under
[1:31:36] her
[1:31:38] influence amen this is scripture being
[1:31:40] lived out you say well it's just a nice
[1:31:42] photo they have a meeting this is
[1:31:43] scripture being lived
[1:31:45] out amen we don't want to just take it
[1:31:48] you know nothing more than that
[1:31:50] now
[1:31:53] he says this and this lean not into your
[1:31:54] own understanding see I was up there um
[1:31:57] so so we was up there in Finland little
[1:31:59] boy was raised from the dead they stood
[1:32:00] from Russian soldiers at attention they
[1:32:02] said we'll receive a God that can raise
[1:32:04] up the dead we had made denominations
[1:32:06] schools buildings and fail to do what
[1:32:08] Jesus told us to do was preach the
[1:32:09] gospel we tried to educate the world he
[1:32:11] he never said educate the world um that
[1:32:15] the uh he's that's educated shall be
[1:32:17] saved you've got to be born again filled
[1:32:19] with the spirit that's the reason we
[1:32:20] have so miserably found
[1:32:22] see we've got the wealth we've got the
[1:32:23] thing now what will happen and when this
[1:32:25] church the World Council of churches
[1:32:27] goes together can't you see who's going
[1:32:29] to do the leading can't you Methodist
[1:32:32] Presbyterians understand that the rest
[1:32:34] of you even to Pentecostals you say
[1:32:36] you're not going in you'll either go in
[1:32:39] or you'll bust up the denomination
[1:32:41] you'll you'll do one or the other that's
[1:32:43] right before you you've got to do it
[1:32:46] it's a forcing the mark of the beast
[1:32:48] that's what it is
[1:32:50] exactly so he says you'll either go in
[1:32:53] he says you will go in because back then
[1:32:56] there was there was still D say we we we
[1:32:59] will not join this thing and they went
[1:33:01] right in it all the same here's Elijah
[1:33:04] see these things that he says he's
[1:33:06] telling us this is this is this is
[1:33:08] what's happening this is where we
[1:33:10] are he says you will go in or you'll
[1:33:13] break up your denomination they can't
[1:33:15] break up the denomination cuz the spirit
[1:33:17] in that thing is an
[1:33:19] organization amen and you've never scen
[1:33:22] it's a people always leave a church
[1:33:25] system they never actually change the
[1:33:27] whole thing that God can work with them
[1:33:29] again you you know that's why there's a
[1:33:31] multitude of denominations today is
[1:33:33] because there's a syst like the Catholic
[1:33:35] church with the Lutheran the Catholic
[1:33:37] chur Chang the Lutheran left Wesley came
[1:33:40] out of the Anglican Church Pentecostals
[1:33:42] came out of their denominations all the
[1:33:44] way down through because the system
[1:33:46] wasn't willing to
[1:33:49] change now he says this he says now
[1:33:53] remember all right I predict this is in
[1:33:55] 1962 this in 62 remember the world was
[1:33:59] very different back then the world was
[1:34:01] very different but I'm I'm showing you
[1:34:03] these things is because the prophet
[1:34:05] prophesied these things would
[1:34:07] happen yeah so he and he's telling us
[1:34:11] this is what's going
[1:34:13] on now remember I predicted the two
[1:34:15] denominational groups Pentecostal and
[1:34:17] the Evangelical groups will work
[1:34:20] together in a denom ation will unite
[1:34:22] themselves together and will become a
[1:34:24] member all of them of the Federation of
[1:34:27] the Council of churches or the Council
[1:34:29] of churches they already belong to it
[1:34:31] all of them and there and there will
[1:34:33] become through them a forcing or a
[1:34:35] boycott that'll stop everything but what
[1:34:38] belongs to that Union of churches he
[1:34:41] says that's he says the Bible said there
[1:34:43] would be a boycott even to such a way
[1:34:45] would cause people not to buy or sell
[1:34:48] unless theyve received this the mark of
[1:34:49] the beast which is romanism and and the
[1:34:51] image of the Beast which is
[1:34:52] protestantism that the image the Beast
[1:34:55] had the Power Authority to give the
[1:34:56] image life to speak and it did and
[1:34:59] that's the confederation of churches
[1:35:01] when they Confederate themselves
[1:35:02] together now there's many young people
[1:35:05] here I don't know Jesus may come this
[1:35:07] afternoon he may come next year I don't
[1:35:09] know when he'll be coming but remember
[1:35:11] if I don't live to see that day of his
[1:35:13] coming which I hope I will and somehow
[1:35:15] believe I will now if I do not see it do
[1:35:18] not let this word depart from your ears
[1:35:20] and your hearts
[1:35:21] just remember I speak in the name of the
[1:35:23] Lord now I believe with all my heart
[1:35:25] there's such a way it'll wind up
[1:35:27] there'll be a union of boycott all such
[1:35:30] places as this here will be closed down
[1:35:32] and you'll not be able to speak unless
[1:35:33] you've got a permission or a license
[1:35:35] from this Federation of churches to hold
[1:35:37] a service it's almost it shows it does
[1:35:41] that even now in the denomination you
[1:35:44] take you take like brother Greg down in
[1:35:45] Christ Church preaching in the
[1:35:47] prisons of course he's not part of the
[1:35:49] will Council of churches it came to a
[1:35:51] point where they kicked him out there
[1:35:53] was a
[1:35:54] boycott in the prison he wasn't allowed
[1:35:56] to minister to the prisoners anymore
[1:35:59] amen you take going into hospitals you
[1:36:01] got to be part of the chapel group
[1:36:04] otherwise you can't do it what's
[1:36:06] happening there's a boyot is a union
[1:36:08] unless you're part of the Union you
[1:36:09] can't do
[1:36:10] it
[1:36:11] amen I tell you what friends we've been
[1:36:15] told if you wonder what's going on you
[1:36:18] get into this word you get into this
[1:36:20] word and you'll find out what's going on

[1:36:30] Hallelujah glory amen we're free people
[1:36:34] now this is from Godless evil age I'm
[1:36:37] just going to throw this thing that
[1:36:38] chose who's the head of it it's Satan in
[1:36:40] the form of a Superman person of
[1:36:42] knowledge a super knowledge he knows
[1:36:45] more than all the rest of them no matter
[1:36:47] what the word says he's got his own
[1:36:48] interpretation to it see the
[1:36:50] interpretation for this evil age notice
[1:36:52] has plans to build a super
[1:36:54] denominational Church the World Council
[1:36:56] church is here a super denomination so
[1:36:58] that all the world will worship Him the
[1:37:00] Beast under the name of United
[1:37:04] Christianity amen would you like to read
[1:37:07] that in the Bible revelations 1336 and 8
[1:37:09] we just read it as a modern P Tower of
[1:37:12] Babel don't you remember how that Nimrod
[1:37:14] that hypocrit built this big tower and
[1:37:16] made all the other little cities pay
[1:37:18] tribute to it Babel and Babel is a the
[1:37:21] same thing it just changes its names as
[1:37:24] it comes on up it's Rome now is Babylon
[1:37:27] and the whole world's bought to Babylon
[1:37:30] and it's broughten by the World Council
[1:37:32] of churches we just read that
[1:37:34] Revelations 1 we just read that which
[1:37:37] will make every one of them bow to her
[1:37:39] and you took the mark of the beast not
[1:37:41] known what you doing but those who are
[1:37:44] elected will hear the word and come out
[1:37:46] of it amen hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:37:49] Jesus now let's go on to some people
[1:37:51] people now I'm sure you've I'll send you
[1:37:53] the link of the video If you haven't
[1:37:55] seen this remember if you've seen the
[1:37:57] video Tony Palmer here this bishop here
[1:38:00] who's actually a Episcopalian Bishop but
[1:38:03] part of the Interfaith dialogue he was a
[1:38:06] good friends of Pope Francis before he
[1:38:08] became Pope Francis and then what
[1:38:10] happens is they have a meeting and then
[1:38:13] because he's an Interfaith man he's
[1:38:15] about to go to a a pastor's meeting run
[1:38:18] by Kenneth Copeland now these are
[1:38:20] heavies these are big people in the
[1:38:22] world and I'll show you how big they are
[1:38:24] and then you remember he he he gives an
[1:38:27] address and he reads Malachi 4 but
[1:38:29] turning the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:38:30] children hearts of children to the
[1:38:31] fathers he said now this is I and he
[1:38:34] says I come in the spirit of
[1:38:36] Elijah to bring
[1:38:39] reconciliation that's not the spirit of
[1:38:41] Elijah RH know the spirit of Elijah IO
[1:38:43] reconciles God and man amen hallelujah
[1:38:46] amen and then he he he he already
[1:38:49] recorded a video message of of the Pope
[1:38:52] who who's seen this clip yeah who's seen
[1:38:54] this clip okay I'll send you a link if
[1:38:56] you haven't seen it and then you know
[1:38:58] the Pope says you know we've all done
[1:39:00] wrong we've all sinned you know but
[1:39:02] we're
[1:39:03] brothers now this man represents a
[1:39:07] system that murdered 68 million people
[1:39:09] that's right and he's saying we've all
[1:39:11] done wrong 68 million Souls because they
[1:39:16] would not bow to his
[1:39:18] religion he says we've all done wrong
[1:39:21] we've all sinned we've all short know
[1:39:23] fell you know come short of the glory of
[1:39:25] God but we're
[1:39:26] brothers and he's basically giving a you
[1:39:28] know giving a arms of Fellowship out to
[1:39:31] you know out to the out to the uh
[1:39:34] charismatic move remember the
[1:39:36] Pentecostal move morph into the
[1:39:37] charismatic
[1:39:38] move and then Tony Palmer says that the
[1:39:41] uh you know the Lutheran had already
[1:39:44] signed a declaration of understanding
[1:39:46] with the Vatican you know saying about
[1:39:49] the you know just shall live by faith
[1:39:50] and all all these things they made a
[1:39:52] they made a Reconciliation and he says
[1:39:55] that the methodists have done the same
[1:39:57] notice how he identifies the moves you
[1:39:59] identifies the moves that were birthed
[1:40:01] under the church age Messengers
[1:40:02] identifies Luther there in Sardis and
[1:40:04] then and then Wesley and Philadelphia
[1:40:06] you he identifies these main moves and
[1:40:09] he B and and he says he says they've
[1:40:12] stopped
[1:40:13] protesting he says the Protestant error
[1:40:16] is over it's finished he says have you
[1:40:20] have you ended it too
[1:40:21] he says in a manner of
[1:40:23] words and then so he says pray for us he
[1:40:26] you know he asked them all to pray for
[1:40:28] us we'll pray for you and then he gets
[1:40:31] up and says Heaven is thrilled over this
[1:40:33] there's a you know monumentous occasions
[1:40:35] going on Heaven is thrilled I Say No
[1:40:38] Heaven is not thrilled over this amen
[1:40:42] this is the B remember the tears must be
[1:40:44] bound amen that's right how do you bind
[1:40:48] people spiritually you preach a word the
[1:40:50] the true word of God binds you to Christ
[1:40:53] you become one with him when Peter was
[1:40:55] preaching in cornelius's house says well
[1:40:57] yet Peter spake these words the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost fell upon them so he was preaching
[1:41:02] the word and they received that by faith
[1:41:04] and it caused them to become United with
[1:41:06] Christ so how do you bind tears you take
[1:41:09] scripture and you preach a perverted
[1:41:11] satanic gospel in the name of Jesus
[1:41:14] though and it doesn't bind the people
[1:41:16] the Christ it binds themselves say for
[1:41:18] the
[1:41:19] burning that's pretty strong but that's
[1:41:21] just how it is that's
[1:41:24] right um so then they all prayed for him
[1:41:27] and basically they accepted his uh you
[1:41:29] know his his invitation for Brotherhood
[1:41:31] and then so that was before this meeting
[1:41:33] in the Vatican and then now they all go
[1:41:35] and they have a meeting with Pope France
[1:41:37] uh Pope Pope Francis here this is after
[1:41:40] that video now we're just going to go
[1:41:42] through these people these are these are
[1:41:44] powerful people in the world of
[1:41:47] Christianity now let's take we'll just
[1:41:49] take some names so John
[1:41:51] uh John and Carol Arn it here on the
[1:41:53] left hand
[1:41:56] side so their church was the one where
[1:42:00] the Toronto blessing remember the
[1:42:01] Toronto blessing in 94 the you know the
[1:42:03] Laughing Revival and all these things
[1:42:05] and these these unscriptural
[1:42:07] manifestations of what they call was the
[1:42:09] Holy Ghost have you seen it yeah they
[1:42:12] are the pastors of that church with that
[1:42:14] first fell in
[1:42:16] Toronto so here's so this is how
[1:42:19] deceptive the devil is
[1:42:21] he puts forward what he calls a
[1:42:23] church and he claims now that this is
[1:42:26] God
[1:42:27] moving and remember we have the prophecy
[1:42:30] of false anointed ones at the end time
[1:42:32] brother Braham when he goes into that
[1:42:33] sermon you hear at the beginning he says
[1:42:35] now I'm going to speak about prophecy so
[1:42:37] when he's preaching that sermon he says
[1:42:39] that whole sermon is actually
[1:42:41] prophecy amen and that sermon is more
[1:42:43] alive today than it was when he preached
[1:42:46] it that's right false so people can be
[1:42:48] Anointed with the Holy Ghost but the
[1:42:49] vessel is false
[1:42:51] and the vessel's objective is to swing
[1:42:53] the people not into Christ but swing
[1:42:55] them into Babel you look at balam
[1:42:58] anointed prophet of God but he was a
[1:43:00] false prophet but this he actually
[1:43:03] prophesied true things but his intent
[1:43:06] wasn't to wasn't to help Moses and what
[1:43:08] God was doing when when God was working
[1:43:11] with them his intent was to swing the
[1:43:13] people to be cursed by God and when he
[1:43:16] couldn't curse them he caused them to
[1:43:19] become one with
[1:43:21] Moab go read about it Numbers 22 to 25
[1:43:25] that was his intent and that is a false
[1:43:28] a false prophet swings the people to
[1:43:30] become United with the wrong thing yeah
[1:43:34] and so and then this guy Brian still is
[1:43:38] the global Ambassador for the world
[1:43:40] Evangelical Alliance the global
[1:43:43] Association which represents some 600
[1:43:46] million Evangelical
[1:43:48] Protestants now remember when a head of
[1:43:51] something does something everyone
[1:43:53] underneath that head is is affected by
[1:43:57] that man's decision so by him
[1:44:01] going he is uniting whether they recogn
[1:44:04] he the people that attribute themselves
[1:44:06] to that system he's uniting them to
[1:44:11] Babylon amen
[1:44:14] right this guy Thomas uh T Cliff he was
[1:44:18] the Secretary General for the world of
[1:44:20] um Evangelical Alliance from 2005
[1:44:24] 2014 um this these two here James and
[1:44:27] bny Robinson were American tell
[1:44:29] evangelist and of course Tony P was the
[1:44:31] bishop who caused all these things to be
[1:44:34] but you just think
[1:44:36] six 600 million
[1:44:39] Souls this man he's not a small
[1:44:43] fish amen These Guys these guys have
[1:44:46] churches International churches they're

[1:46:15] Jesus what Jesus are they referring to
[1:46:18] what Jesus Remember in the the beginning
[1:46:20] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:46:23] the Word was God and that word became
[1:46:24] flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus is his
[1:46:28] word so what you know what Jesus do do
[1:46:32] they all
[1:46:35] love
[1:46:37] um upon meeting Pope Francis warranted
[1:46:40] up close you can feel the humility and
[1:46:42] compassion that others see from
[1:46:44] afar look at this here um participants
[1:46:47] included Southern Baptist evangelic even
[1:46:51] evangelist russal Mo as well as Muslim
[1:46:54] Jewish and latterday Saint
[1:46:57] Representatives now these guys the
[1:47:01] Mormons they consider themselves totally
[1:47:03] separate really from from you know the
[1:47:05] rest of
[1:47:08] Christianity but you see theyve sent
[1:47:10] representatives to these things what's
[1:47:13] happening there's a dialogue has begun
[1:47:16] what's happening tears are being bound
[1:47:19] right
[1:47:21] Muslim Jewish all kinds of all the tears
[1:47:26] are being
[1:47:27] bound I'm just I'm just showing you
[1:47:29] these things because we're at the end of
[1:47:32] all
[1:47:34] things
[1:47:36] now and then Joel
[1:47:39] oin uh you know he went there as well
[1:47:42] and he was incredibly moved by the whole
[1:47:43] experience he said the Pope's a
[1:47:45] wonderful man and all these things he is
[1:47:48] a household these guys are household
[1:47:49] names
[1:47:51] they're teaching influences you know you
[1:47:54] go to any church out here and they will
[1:47:57] know who you're talking about when you
[1:47:58] reference these guys amen and there
[1:48:02] their their teachings have influenced
[1:48:04] the
[1:48:06] world and the intent of
[1:48:09] that is to you we you read Revelations
[1:48:12] 13 that calls
[1:48:14] all and the image of the Beast will
[1:48:16] worship you caus all to worship the
[1:48:18] Beast so all all of this is an intent
[1:48:21] that this system receives
[1:48:25] worship amen tears are being
[1:48:28] bound now we'll go
[1:48:34] back okay this is from the church age
[1:48:36] book this is in 1965 this was published
[1:48:39] 1965 he says the false Church groups
[1:48:42] this is from the resume of the ages the
[1:48:44] last chapter the false Church groups
[1:48:47] will come together in a world Council
[1:48:48] churches This World Council the churches
[1:48:50] is the image Ed to the Beast and we read
[1:48:52] Revelations 131 to18 now remember it was
[1:48:55] Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the
[1:48:57] sword but she was healed of a death
[1:48:59] stroke when she joined to the nominal
[1:49:01] Christian Church of Rome and
[1:49:03] Incorporated paganism and Christianity
[1:49:05] and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire
[1:49:08] which was to endure until Jesus came and
[1:49:10] destroyed her but Rome is not going
[1:49:13] alone her daughters are right with her
[1:49:15] and she will make she will take over
[1:49:18] absolute Authority by the World Council
[1:49:21] of churches remember it said the image
[1:49:22] would cause all to worship the
[1:49:24] Beast yeah will cause so receive
[1:49:29] absolute Authority by the world counil
[1:49:31] churches this may seem farfetched to
[1:49:33] some but actually it's very plain for
[1:49:35] all to see because right now the
[1:49:37] churches are controlling politics and at
[1:49:40] the opportune time will manifest exactly
[1:49:42] how great is that control this
[1:49:45] ecumenical move will end up with Rome at
[1:49:48] the head even though the people did not
[1:49:50] Envision it that
[1:49:53] way have you ever seen footage of people
[1:49:55] meeting the pope doesn't matter what
[1:49:57] country he goes to or if people come to
[1:49:59] him they come to him he's the boss he's
[1:50:03] the boss when they roll out the red
[1:50:05] carpet it's not that he would come and
[1:50:08] meet them but that they would come and
[1:50:10] meet him right am hey he's the
[1:50:15] boss he will see he end up with Rome at
[1:50:18] the head this is so because in
[1:50:20] Revelations 13 17 3-6 it states that the
[1:50:23] whole mystery of Babylon is Seated on
[1:50:25] the Beast is controlling the last or
[1:50:26] fourth Empire this Roman Church is going
[1:50:29] is doing that with the World Church
[1:50:31] system under Rome will be controlling
[1:50:34] and this image church system will be
[1:50:35] obedient to Rome because Rome controls
[1:50:38] the gold of the world thus all the
[1:50:41] people will have to belong to the church
[1:50:44] uh World Church system or be at the
[1:50:46] mercy of the elements for they cannot
[1:50:47] buy or sell without the mark of the
[1:50:48] beast and the Hand of or head this Mark
[1:50:51] in the head means that they will have to
[1:50:54] take the doctrine of the World Church
[1:50:55] system which is trinitarianism ETC and
[1:50:58] the mark in the hand which means to do
[1:51:00] the will of the World Church this with
[1:51:03] this great power the church systems will
[1:51:05] persecute the true bride this image will
[1:51:08] try and keep the bride from preaching
[1:51:10] and teaching Etc her ministers will be
[1:51:12] forbidden to give comfort and Truth to
[1:51:14] people to the people who need it but
[1:51:16] before the Antichrist in person takes
[1:51:19] over this complete World System of
[1:51:21] churches the true church will be taken
[1:51:23] away from this world to be with be with
[1:51:25] the Lord God will catch away his bride
[1:51:28] for the great marriage supper of the
[1:51:30] Lamb hallelujah thank
[1:51:34] Lord
[1:51:36] amen this is where we are
[1:51:40] amen we are here we're not looking for
[1:51:44] things to happen it's already happened
[1:51:45] you know we where we are in time is so
[1:51:49] late when many times we we you read the
[1:51:51] scripture think maybe when's this going
[1:51:53] to happen it's already happened it's
[1:51:54] already happening we're at the end time
[1:51:57] that's right amen hallelujah but God
[1:51:59] sent a message remember the tears would
[1:52:01] be bound for the burning first but then
[1:52:03] gather the wheat to the so as the tears
[1:52:05] are being bound God has sent a voice
[1:52:07] into this world am me to gather the
[1:52:09] wheat he say how do I that's why I say
[1:52:12] if there's something in you that's
[1:52:13] responded to this word if there's
[1:52:16] something it says yes this is me yes
[1:52:18] this is true even it had to tell your
[1:52:20] strips off your back when you first
[1:52:21] heard it and you had to virtually you
[1:52:23] know you had to give up everything you
[1:52:24] loved you had to give up something and
[1:52:27] you said yes this is me you're wheat
[1:52:30] amen amen if something in you says yes
[1:52:33] this is true this message is true and
[1:52:35] it's not just your lip service but your
[1:52:37] life gives testimony to it you're wheat
[1:52:39] and you've been gathered for the bar
[1:52:41] amen hallelujah amen how do I know I'm
[1:52:44] predestinated because something in me
[1:52:45] says I believe this word amen amen and
[1:52:48] that's all it doesn't matter how you
[1:52:50] feel good times bad times whatever times
[1:52:52] something in you says this is true and
[1:52:54] you couldn't forsake it even if you
[1:52:56] wanted
[1:52:57] to Hallelujah that means you're the
[1:52:59] elected ones that means you're the one
[1:53:02] that that he is looking for Hallelujah
[1:53:04] and I'll say this as well if the devil
[1:53:07] Whispers in your ear this is not really
[1:53:09] this is just a bunch of hooky Spooks or
[1:53:12] conspiracy and there's nothing to this
[1:53:14] he's a
[1:53:15] liar amen this these events is this
[1:53:19] lived out amen
[1:53:22] hallelujah amen maybe let's just leave
[1:53:24] it there shall we can we have some
[1:53:26] musicians to come we've heard a voice in
[1:53:28] this day I trust you've heard it don't
[1:53:31] let it become common to you amen we have
[1:53:34] a way of Escape out of this world and
[1:53:36] that's the Rapture of the church
[1:53:39] hallelujah hallelujah I was watching a I
[1:53:41] was watching a thing on Moses last night
[1:53:44] a a uh it was the Bible Min uh uh you
[1:53:48] know the Bible miniseries
[1:53:50] and here's the people you know I was
[1:53:52] thinking why can't they just quote the
[1:53:53] scripture and stay with it but hey it's
[1:53:54] all right and then so the Israel is
[1:53:57] fleeing through the Red Sea it's been
[1:53:58] parted and and so they dramatized it
[1:54:00] that the Egyptians are literally right
[1:54:02] on their heels yeah now we're living in
[1:54:06] a time I'll probably say this we're
[1:54:07] living in a time where we have been
[1:54:10] literally our backs are against the wall
[1:54:13] like they were against the Red Sea and
[1:54:16] we forget sometimes that God told Moses
[1:54:18] you know I don't know why they dramatize
[1:54:20] these things and then you know the
[1:54:22] people God told Moses take the people
[1:54:25] here down to here and you come to the
[1:54:27] Red Sea here he tells them to do
[1:54:29] it and this is all arranged because God
[1:54:32] is saying to Pharaoh bring all your
[1:54:34] power am bring all your power see what
[1:54:37] you can do and then when it looks like
[1:54:39] the whole thing is hopeless God opens
[1:54:41] the
[1:54:42] sea and there's and and they're going
[1:54:45] through the sea into a new land they've
[1:54:46] never been before amen
[1:54:50] and when the enemy tries to come through
[1:54:52] that same way he gets destroyed it's the
[1:54:55] same thing with you and I we're standing
[1:54:56] we're standing Time and Eternity is
[1:54:59] blending and our way through that red
[1:55:01] sea is the rapture amen and the devil
[1:55:05] God has allow the devil to bring all his
[1:55:06] forces to trap him upon this Earth amen
[1:55:09] that's why the devil's raging because
[1:55:11] the God is allow he says come come
[1:55:13] Pharaoh bring your chariots bring your
[1:55:15] weapons bring bring all your demon
[1:55:17] powers amen because he's actually giving
[1:55:20] the devil a challenge yeah come come try
[1:55:23] what you can do show your Mighty power
[1:55:27] and there's an elected lady that's about
