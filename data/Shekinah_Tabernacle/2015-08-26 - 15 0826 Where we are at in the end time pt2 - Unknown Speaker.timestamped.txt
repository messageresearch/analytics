[27:48] foundation of the world that we should
[27:50] be holy and without blame before him and
[27:52] love having predestinated us unto the

[28:17] according to his good pleasure which he
[28:20] had purposed in himself that in the
[28:22] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[28:24] might gather together then one all
[28:27] things in Christ both which are in
[28:29] heaven and which are on earth even in
[28:31] him and whom also we have obtained an
[28:34] inheritance pink being predestinated

[28:41] own will hallelujah amen they may be
[28:45] seated grace a look a lord blesses would
[28:47] you know
[28:49] have you filled out just read that Lydia
[28:53] what do I want to continue where I was
[28:55] speaking on Sunday where we are at the
[28:58] end time yeah where are we in the
[28:59] employment we see here Paul is speaking
[29:02] about here saying at a certain time God
[29:07] is going to gather all you know a good
[29:10] Teddy's gonna that he might gather
[29:12] together and when all things in Christ
[29:14] which are in heaven and which aren't
[29:16] earth even at him see saying in the
[29:18] dispensation of the fullness of times
[29:20] this is when he's going to do these
[29:21] things and we understand from the
[29:24] reading of the scripture you can go back
[29:26] and you can you can read where where
[29:29] Moses came by the scene and there's a
[29:30] dispensation of the law and then when
[29:33] Jesus you know Jesus came to John the
[29:36] Baptist came there was a change for a
[29:38] dispensation of the law now are under
[29:40] the dispensation of grace so there's a
[29:42] change in the and how God was working
[29:45] and then there came still in the
[29:47] dispensation of grace now they came the
[29:50] dispensation of the cemetery changes so
[29:52] you know business has your grace came in
[29:54] and we understand that that will
[29:55] continue until we go for the rapture and
[29:58] then dispensation of grace will go into
[30:00] the juice to the 154,000 but within that
[30:03] time there Simmons your changes there's
[30:05] a rapture there's also a great
[30:07] tribulation a mint is a is a wedding
[30:11] supper of the Lamb there's all these
[30:12] things within that span but Paul is
[30:15] telling us set in and then when it comes
[30:17] jobs to the ends
[30:19] dispensation of the fullness of x is
[30:22] going to gather all one and we can see
[30:26] from the scripture that it will be at
[30:27] the end that God will do this where he
[30:30] will gather all one all things in Christ
[30:33] so I just want to say that we are in the
[30:36] dispensation of the fullness of time you
[30:38] know time has run out this there's no
[30:40] more changes to come there's no more to
[30:42] change messengers there's no more
[30:44] profits to the Gentiles all they're
[30:46] looking for us to change in these bodies
[30:48] as well this is where we are in the
[30:50] scripture you know there's no messenger
[30:52] then donate angel there's no you know
[30:54] anything that's that's there's nothing
[30:57] more for us what we have received we
[31:00] have received and we have received
[31:03] Christ at his fullness we're not looking
[31:05] for another message to come you know my
[31:07] brother branham when he is preaching the
[31:08] rapture message he he begins to place us
[31:11] in first Thessalonians 4 and he says
[31:13] that the message is the shelf you know
[31:17] so he and he doesn't leave at any
[31:19] mysterious like he just declares that
[31:21] the message is the shower so because of
[31:24] profit on their profit complacence and
[31:27] the work paul here was placing not just
[31:30] the Ephesians which is also true thee to
[31:33] the faithful in Christ Jesus and this
[31:35] letter speaks of us as well and him
[31:38] being a prophet he he placed the people
[31:40] he plays price of his position name
[31:42] above all names I above everything else
[31:45] and then he placed the believers
[31:46] position in Christ only a prophet can do
[31:49] those things and then so excuse me and
[31:53] then so we have now we have come down to
[31:56] the end time and brother and another
[31:58] prophet standing here saying this is
[32:00] where we are then time the message is
[32:03] the shower so he places the first
[32:06] Thessalonians chapter 4 saying this is
[32:08] where you up you have arrived here this
[32:10] is where you are present he's not taking
[32:13] a shot as good a company saying the
[32:15] message is the shower so you've already
[32:17] received it it had already been given
[32:19] you know
[32:20] revenue his ministry they just make you
[32:22] were making review ever well what has
[32:25] already come so he's placing he's
[32:27] placing the bright now this is where we
[32:29] are and it gives them credible I believe
[32:32] it gives incredible faith to a people
[32:34] that can see Jesus Christ in their day
[32:37] which we have saved me and give this
[32:40] incredible faith that this is so the
[32:42] Prophet can say this is where you are in
[32:45] the world and your next step is into
[32:47] immortality maybe this is where we are
[32:50] you always say you have arrived here and
[32:52] your next episode the immortality so a
[32:55] dispensation now the word dispensation
[32:59] of means and administration this is in
[33:01] the group that means of a household or
[33:03] estate and it's it yo specifically your
[33:08] religious or an economy and also means a
[33:11] dispensation of a stewardship so that's
[33:14] an administration of something so when
[33:16] Moses came he administered the law and
[33:19] the people fell under the administration
[33:22] you know the dispensation of the law and
[33:24] then now when John the Baptist came he
[33:27] he was called now to turn the people
[33:30] frog Moses to receive the one that Moses
[33:34] was pointing to because now had come and
[33:36] change in the season where the law was
[33:39] going to be fulfilled in a god man women
[33:42] and that same life would go to a
[33:44] believer that that spirited them will
[33:47] now look out that law amen so now there
[33:51] was a change now a dispensational change
[33:53] was taking place and we see let's just
[33:56] read some scriptures i just want to show
[33:58] you this go to Hebrews chapter 3 because
[34:01] Paul speaks about this as well here
[34:04] speaking of a edit and this dispensation
[34:07] being at
[34:08] administration because reread here in
[34:11] Hebrews free and good book that uh he
[34:19] says now
[34:25] he says wherefore holy brother partakers
[34:28] of the heavenly calling consider the
[34:31] Apostle and high priest of our
[34:33] profession in Christ Jesus who are
[34:36] faithful to him that had a point of him
[34:39] as also Moses was faithful in all his
[34:42] house for this man was counted word in
[34:44] more glory than Moses and so much that
[34:46] he who had builded the house had more
[34:49] honor than the house for every house
[34:52] that is builder by some man but he that
[34:54] felt all things as God and Moses belly
[34:57] was faithful in all this house as a
[34:58] servant for a testimony of those things
[35:01] which were to be spoken after so he was
[35:05] he was a faithful steward of the
[35:07] household of God he administered what
[35:10] was given to have the law he
[35:12] administered it and you can see that he
[35:15] administered it faithfully because when
[35:17] the tabernacle was built in the
[35:19] priesthood was arranged and all the
[35:21] vessels were placed and everything God
[35:23] came and filled that tavenner that was
[35:25] the vindication of Moses was the truth
[35:27] and God came down and dwelt among his
[35:29] people as the same thing now with Jesus
[35:32] Christ our Lord and Savior was here his
[35:34] vindication was God came in dwelt in his
[35:37] church amen that was just one occasion
[35:40] that was the proof that he not only died
[35:42] but he rose again and so we can see now
[35:45] that you know when whenever a there's a
[35:50] change of dispensation it's for God to
[35:52] Kevin being before with with with us big
[35:55] wonder the blood of bulls and go but now
[35:57] us to be in his people and we see that
[36:01] John the Baptist and he came in the
[36:05] spirit of Elijah and the purpose of the
[36:08] spirit of Elijah as as to do two things
[36:11] and we can see this in first Kings
[36:13] chapter 18 win when Elijah is there with
[36:16] the priests of a land on Mount Carmel
[36:18] and having that show down and there's
[36:21] 400 priests avail in there
[36:23] built their altar and you put their
[36:25] sacrifice there and they're trying to
[36:26] call fire down from their God out of
[36:28] heaven to consumer sacrifice and what
[36:32] happens now is Elijah standing here and
[36:34] he's waiting he's waiting for he's
[36:37] basically waiting for the evening time
[36:38] to come because he knows that that the
[36:40] priests of Baal cannot call barring him
[36:42] against the mock them saying man he
[36:44] called a bit louder maybe he's sleeping
[36:45] maybe he's pursuing maybe he's busy but
[36:48] all of it later you'll get his attention
[36:50] in it and he begins to mock them and
[36:52] what happens is during that climate says
[36:55] in first Kings 18 of verse 30 and Elijah
[36:57] stood up to all the people come near
[36:59] unto me so they were going to have a
[37:01] evangelistic service he's gathering the
[37:03] people come near unto me and all the
[37:05] people came near unto him and he
[37:07] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[37:10] broken down so here we have Israel is
[37:12] standing here on this mountain these
[37:14] people try to worship God and they're
[37:17] very older that was there to worship God
[37:19] is not even be built think about his
[37:22] believers who are in the promised land
[37:24] and their approach to God a lot as has
[37:27] has come into disarray and no one else
[37:30] noticed that the older was book was
[37:32] broken down was Elijah that revealed the
[37:34] altar he didn't build another old he
[37:36] rebuilt one that had already been there
[37:38] and so he he he rebuilt now the correct
[37:43] approach to God and then he you know he
[37:46] put the you know if you you know just
[37:48] the same time for ganja but you know
[37:51] that how he had the trench dug around
[37:52] Italy what the sacrifice there and they
[37:55] took barrels of water and they poured
[37:57] water on top of it so filled the mood
[37:59] around the around the altar and then at
[38:03] the evening time he begins to say in
[38:07] verse 37 it says here Mia o Lord hear me
[38:11] that this people may know that thou art
[38:13] the Lord God and that thou has turned
[38:17] their heart back again and it said then
[38:20] the fire the Lord Fallon consumed the
[38:22] burnt sacrifice and wouldn't
[38:24] dogs and the Dyson looked up the water
[38:26] that was in the trench and when all the
[38:28] people saw it they fell in their faces
[38:30] may hit the Lord he is God the Lord he
[38:32] is God so what's happened peace he's
[38:35] rebuilt the frick wait up to to worship
[38:37] God and he did this on the intent that
[38:40] the people's hearts would be turned back
[38:41] so their hearts would be turned so the
[38:44] purpose what God uses spirit of Elijah
[38:47] is for a real sacrifice to be instituted
[38:50] and for the field we turn back to the
[38:52] living god and you can see that in God's
[38:55] ministry that his purpose as the angel
[38:58] told his father luke 17 thing he says a
[39:01] now shop and he shall go before him in
[39:03] the spirit and parable is to turn the
[39:05] heart to the father's to the children
[39:07] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[39:10] just to make ready a people prepared to
[39:12] the Lord that's why God see the light
[39:14] syrup on there that the people's hearts
[39:16] would be too I mean that they could
[39:18] receive the true sacrifice calamity and
[39:20] this is why John was sent now if you
[39:25] jump remember there's a change of
[39:27] dispensation therefore lauded grace and
[39:29] now we at the end now than the seventh
[39:33] church age have come down to a junction
[39:35] where the church ages have come to an
[39:38] end and now eternity is about to come a
[39:40] policy should time is fading out and
[39:43] eternity has come again so in order for
[39:46] this to happen God had to set Elijah
[39:49] again because of people had to truly
[39:52] know their God so the people had to be
[39:54] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[39:57] and that's why it says in Malachi for he
[40:00] shall behold I send your lives of the
[40:02] Prophet before the coming of the great
[40:04] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[40:05] turn the hearts of the father's to the
[40:07] children and weary that's what John did
[40:09] and I have the children to their fathers
[40:12] least I come and smite the earth with a
[40:14] curse so God Henderson Elijah to the end
[40:18] time now to turn the people from their
[40:21] traditions and from there you know yep
[40:24] theological ideas and
[40:27] turn them to the true Living God that's
[40:28] why Elijah can go back into John the
[40:31] Baptist date they had their Bible
[40:33] schools they had their scholars they had
[40:35] their ideas and here came a man out of
[40:37] the wilderness so I'm going to point you
[40:39] to the real the real value movement here
[40:42] comes ulema call the tax where the sin
[40:43] of the world and you come down two
[40:45] thousand years and then we have our
[40:47] bible school and we have our theology
[40:48] and we have our ideas now smart man and
[40:51] here comes a man out of the seventh
[40:53] grade education from Kentucky say hold
[40:56] the Lamb of God amen amen any and he
[40:59] points the people to the real lamb would
[41:03] have got and so he points them back to
[41:06] the he points us back to the true
[41:08] relationship us and God and this is done
[41:13] this is done because of people because
[41:17] now the Falls of dispossession of times
[41:18] and people can go on a rapture if they
[41:21] believe in error you can't worship your
[41:25] God is a spirit and you must worship God
[41:28] in spirit and in truth as well Jesus and
[41:30] you must is not an option or maybe
[41:32] attack on you must worship God this way
[41:34] to the truth the truth had to be
[41:38] restored and even port die Peter forget
[41:41] to speak about the book of Acts he says
[41:42] whom the heavens must receive speaking
[41:44] of Jesus Christ until the restitution
[41:46] and that would means the restoration of
[41:49] all things so in order for a restoration
[41:52] to take place God send the spirit of
[41:55] Elijah upon the earth that the altar of
[41:58] the Lord would be rebuilt this would be
[42:01] placed correctly yeah
[42:05] x y 0 x 2 38 baptism the oneness of the
[42:09] god here you know all these things that
[42:11] we believe it what is that that is the
[42:13] ultimate rebuild because you know in
[42:17] order you can approach God if you
[42:20] believe these 10 or 20 or free or two
[42:22] you know you're you're approaching a
[42:24] different Jesus to the scripture and so
[42:26] I prepared the cabin identified this is
[42:29] Christ in the scripture and not only
[42:31] just saying this is how the scripture
[42:33] comes together so then the one he spoke
[42:35] about came upon the scene to vindicate
[42:38] what this man who was saying it was gone
[42:40] it was the true and this was done they
[42:43] the fire fell again in this study men
[42:46] can you and is not a natural fire as a
[42:49] Holy Spirit fire a man has fallen upon
[42:52] sacrifices Freeman I think as pulse they
[42:55] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[42:56] in so now now the truth of the word is
[42:59] preached and faint cometh by hearing and
[43:01] hearing the Word of God and then you
[43:03] recognize your loss and undone amen
[43:05] because there's an ultimate then you lay
[43:07] yourself up on that altar amen amen you
[43:09] lay yourself upon that revelation that's
[43:12] been given and then good the fire comes
[43:14] down and consumes you amen and when a
[43:17] when a sacrifice is consumed by fire and
[43:19] goes up in smoke and ashes and that
[43:22] thing isn't there anymore is the bunch
[43:24] of ashes hey there doesn't come back and
[43:26] be a beardy animal anymore it's the same
[43:29] thing with us when we someone lays
[43:31] himself upon the altar i'm in bed life
[43:33] is not the same it is not the same as
[43:36] head life that later south down and gets
[43:38] back up on the newness of life
[43:44] this was done this was God Henderson
[43:47] Elijah turn your heart amen if you if
[43:51] your heart is being too if you've heard
[43:54] this message in your heart as being you
[43:56] know something and you says that's true
[43:57] then God comes and changes your life
[43:59] your hardest thing to any been if your
[44:02] heart is being turned back to the paint
[44:03] of the phone they ain't God's no you
[44:06] don't do it God doesn't turn you know
[44:08] you didn't turn yourself maybe you've
[44:11] got a teacher so I wanna serve God but
[44:13] no man can and no one that seeks after
[44:15] God the scripture tells us there's no
[44:17] one righteous not one bit so God had to
[44:20] come and turn your heart yeah i mean you
[44:22] say what people say what's happened he
[44:24] say my heart's been to frame it all we
[44:26] got amen hallelujah so now he came now
[44:31] this had to happen because the people
[44:33] had to be prepared to meet the
[44:35] bridegroom in the same time and the
[44:38] front group is the left yep and how can
[44:42] you meet him unless you have a real
[44:43] relationship with them you know unless
[44:46] you're walking with them how can you how
[44:48] can you be ready for me them in the air
[44:50] you come so now brother branham says
[44:55] this Anderson feasts of the trumpets
[44:57] because we must look at you know here's
[44:58] the question is why does the fullest
[45:00] virgin go through the tribulation earth
[45:02] and the bride doesn't go through the
[45:03] tribulation it's because the pride
[45:06] receives the fullness of the atonement
[45:09] manchanda look like very low but every
[45:11] word doesn't mean you understand it put
[45:13] it all together you just say that's me I
[45:15] believe that we do I mean I maintain it
[45:17] turns you but then the other side I
[45:20] don't I don't agree with what you're you
[45:23] know what they're talking about and they
[45:25] come under a partial atonement because
[45:28] if a you know why would someone who's
[45:31] been totally forgiven have to go through
[45:34] the tribulation for a purge your extra
[45:35] purging because we know the tribulation
[45:38] is
[45:38] nature purges the whole world you know
[45:41] if purchase the full of virgil earp
[45:42] urges this route no why would someone
[45:46] who is nothing held against if it their
[45:49] slate is clean there's nothing holding
[45:51] them upon the early why would they have
[45:53] to go and get their life God is an
[45:55] unjust you see so but the only way you
[46:00] can receive full forgiveness as you
[46:03] receive the sacrifice maybe in the only
[46:06] way you can receive the sacrifice of
[46:08] your heart has been turned back to the
[46:09] sacrifice it's just believing the truth
[46:13] of God's work it's all boils down to i
[46:16] believe it we do that's right you know
[46:21] yes it's not a bunch of mental
[46:23] gymnastics it's like you hear the word
[46:25] faith cometh by hearing hearing the Word
[46:27] of God something and you says yes amen
[46:29] and that and that is reflected because
[46:32] there's a transformation of a life and a
[46:35] new life comes full of his might even
[46:36] you so now he says this in the face of
[46:41] the trumpet he says think of it as the
[46:43] end time folks hallelujah the great day
[46:46] the Lord has have had gather yourselves
[46:48] together fish to the Messiah they'll
[46:50] reject them and they'll find out that
[46:53] there is them aside the Bible said
[46:56] striking things with like this would
[46:58] take place and revelations the lever
[47:00] call their ministry of anniversary of
[47:02] Moses and Elijah calling out to Israel
[47:05] out of the Jewish traditions just like
[47:08] the seventh angels message called the
[47:11] bride out of the Pentecostal traditions
[47:13] remember Moses and Elijah is to call
[47:16] Israel out of the old atonement of the
[47:20] lamb and the sheep and the blood and the
[47:22] goats and the sacrifice to the real
[47:24] living sacrifice to the work because now
[47:27] now there now they darken they think
[47:31] they don't even know who Jesus is the
[47:32] real lamb and then they're trying to
[47:35] rebuild something the Moses said so this
[47:38] is to worshipping under that old way but
[47:41] these two problems come Emma Moses calls
[47:43] an exodus like in the first one you call
[47:47] them out and Elijah Desmond was to turn
[47:49] them will turn them back to the original
[47:52] faith well according to the true
[47:54] sacrifice and CEO death part of their
[47:57] ministry
[47:58] so they won't because in revelation 11
[48:01] it says it says the two witnesses and
[48:03] the call witnesses because they they
[48:06] preach the same thing we have already
[48:07] received that's right as we have
[48:09] received Jesus Christ it is foolish they
[48:11] preach the same thing they're a witness
[48:12] of what we have received and so they
[48:15] turn now the people back to the true you
[48:18] know back to the true sacrifice which is
[48:21] the word because the truth highs you
[48:24] then to Calvary because you are jesus
[48:28] said by teaching the commanders and
[48:29] daughters of men you make the Word of
[48:31] God Norfolk so by teaching the truth
[48:35] word of god you make the word of effect
[48:38] it was the effects forgiveness of all
[48:41] the Holy Ghost building the statue of
[48:42] God as the effect of the other the work
[48:45] so that's why I can say to chew them
[48:47] that's why I say people who truly
[48:49] receive this receive the work receive
[48:52] the sacrifice because the truth take
[48:54] ties you back in understand so he says
[48:59] that they will turn the people back to
[49:02] the living sacrifice to the work which
[49:05] is Jesus Christ and the seventh angels
[49:08] message under the same trumpet the same
[49:10] exact everything the same seal is to
[49:13] walk call the people the bribe out of
[49:16] the Pentecostal of world traditions to
[49:18] the genuine atoma the word Christ is his
[49:22] impersonated in his word here made flesh
[49:25] among us science has proven it bye-bye
[49:28] pictures the church knows in the world
[49:31] around we firmly not a feast for he
[49:34] never told us one thing as thus saith
[49:37] the Lord but what can be the truth they
[49:40] say now this ministry
[49:41] turn the people back to the truth
[49:44] relationship with Jesus Christ and
[49:47] that's what the two witnesses and
[49:49] revelations live in will do in a in a
[49:53] future time so it comes a point now we
[49:58] have this fullness this dispensation of
[50:02] the fullness of times now is a winding
[50:04] up of everything God has been doing down
[50:07] through the ages and it has to be a
[50:11] prophet had to come because when God was
[50:15] restoring things from Luther all the way
[50:17] up that was a reformation and
[50:19] Pentecostals of reformation the
[50:21] Pentecostal move was part of that
[50:23] Reformation it wasn't i was totally
[50:26] different to the restoration of the work
[50:29] that we have a mystic it was a
[50:31] reformation man's wisdom tied it all
[50:33] together but then they have 111 come who
[50:37] was going to take us old notes when he
[50:39] came to preach to seal this is I what
[50:41] you I study my old notes and I you know
[50:44] I wasn't too sure what it was and I was
[50:45] going to come out and preach that and
[50:47] you know would have made a terrible
[50:48] mistake if he didn't come down to the
[50:51] room and show me what a wife right so
[50:53] and we'd be on now guess what happened
[50:55] to penticoff which was the restoration
[50:58] of the gift and I can see he had the
[51:03] elijah ministry because the fire felt
[51:06] the Holy Ghost fire felt and you can see
[51:09] that because when God was restoring like
[51:12] the just shall live by faith it was a
[51:15] work of the spirit but it wasn't this
[51:17] birth welling in the people but they had
[51:19] salvation and then when Wesley came
[51:21] along sanctification they believe
[51:24] justification and they believe
[51:25] the sake of the guys in clean living
[51:27] there was another work of the spirit but
[51:29] it wasn't God dwelling in there but that
[51:31] was still had salvation and then the
[51:34] Pentecostal move was a restoration of
[51:35] the gifts and because it looked so much
[51:38] like the book of Acts they said we have
[51:40] arrived but they hadn't arrived but they
[51:43] had salvation but there's still another
[51:46] process had to come where went from
[51:47] gifts now to the giver himself stepping
[51:50] into the people in beer I meant for the
[51:52] real Holy Spirit fight or fall and
[51:54] abiding then not just anoint them not
[51:56] just give them a new spirit changing
[51:58] them changing this Europe but dwelling
[52:01] in their soul the very living one like
[52:04] this is why we have been turned to the
[52:07] true Pentecost amen we have been turned
[52:11] back to an azusa street Pentecost
[52:13] because of the zuzo street king of them
[52:15] just a restoration of gifts it was a
[52:17] work of God and we need the gifts I
[52:19] believe in the gift remove part of a
[52:22] paint if there's you know if there's
[52:25] salvation and this I want that of this
[52:27] eternal life or what that of autumn if
[52:29] there's a body change of on the body
[52:30] change if they're speaking in tongues I
[52:32] wants big and ugly but there's prophecy
[52:34] what prophecy is wisdom I want most to
[52:36] me there's gifts of healing I won't give
[52:38] some healing everything God has for me
[52:39] all over to even a men have you ever
[52:42] seen a little kindling birthday over one
[52:44] prison and they enjoy that prison and
[52:47] hear some other ones and they said I
[52:48] don't want those ones maybe shake them
[52:51] they sound eva they rip it open they get
[52:54] in that they played then they enjoy it
[52:55] people until they break it and they want
[52:57] something else go just like us we don't
[52:59] want to just be so here you go then you

[54:31] life just be a museum but I meant hey
[54:34] it's good to go back and you know and
[54:37] and look at what God has done always and
[54:40] don't just for yourself tell your family
[54:42] tell your children you know I don't
[54:46] think there's any question that says I'm
[54:47] sick of that person testified that's
[54:50] right i mean brother branham told
[54:52] stories of people being heal things that
[54:54] happened years before and he would he
[54:57] would tell like it was just the other
[54:58] day what happened he was he was keeping
[55:00] things that God did in front of the
[55:03] people and we should do the same thing
[55:05] good it made specially in the downtime
[55:08] because if God has started something
[55:10] because you know you must understand to
[55:13] follow this word in the stage of
[55:14] supernatural thing maybe it's a
[55:16] supernatural turning of a half it's not
[55:19] a this is not the highways anymore else
[55:21] this is not the easy road yeah this is
[55:24] not the right of popularity or
[55:26] acceptance or you know just easy living
[55:29] this is not this is not that this is the
[55:31] right good way that's right we call you
[55:33] walk a record way doesn't matter what
[55:35] what we have to go through just go

[55:47] brother man tells us about being healed
[55:49] he says he says look at you look at
[55:52] yourself well and just walk into the
[55:54] province I mean because eventually your
[55:56] subconscious and conscious come together
[55:58] you receive what you mean
[56:00] same thing with the body chains just
[56:02] hold that before you and walk into it
[56:04] yeah and walk like a journey yours yeah

[56:16] the rules his diner but I really enjoy
[56:17] it and it didn't you hear all the time
[56:20] yes oh yeah hey Abraham looked like he
[56:23] was holding Isaac for 25 years he was
[56:26] walking like Ian's eyes and every day
[56:28] became greater and better to have a
[56:31] moral life he just held that perform and
[56:34] he walked into the vision yeah then the
[56:36] vision became material here a minute and
[56:39] either Yahtzee rahat the promised son
[56:41] and they deserve hardships I went
[56:43] through separation and family they went
[56:45] through all these different things but
[56:46] Abraham said this this is my promise
[56:48] this land belongs to me and I'm walking
[56:51] this way and the matter if there was you
[56:54] know it was great Wars going on we're
[56:56] here slumming social unrest and love was
[56:59] taking previous build up with war and
[57:01] all these six and he just kept the
[57:03] promise of forms yet this is mine and
[57:05] we're going to go get him women any I'm
[57:06] disservice he went and gone ooh and he's
[57:09] exactly like you or not hey the same
[57:12] faith is a neighbor hampers in the
[57:14] children of the place to see exactly the
[57:17] same thing I mean it was revealed to him
[57:20] to reveal to us oh maybe one day not one
[57:25] day now yeah hell yeah I'm it's a sign
[57:31] now that
[57:33] here we are the end and we have come to
[57:36] a true Pentecost where it's got beyond
[57:39] just gifts but now the giver dwells in
[57:41] us a mint that is it showing because
[57:45] everyone that is truly walking with God
[57:49] and the sour under this work it doesn't
[57:52] form some organization some people might
[57:55] try and organizer but the true ones who
[57:58] have been become one with him if the
[58:00] organization among them they see
[58:02] Pentecost showed its colors and animate
[58:05] denominations here and there right after
[58:06] Azusa Street few years after azusa
[58:08] street they split they argued they fuss
[58:10] and they made the wonders to turn us in
[58:12] the three nests of what's happening
[58:13] because it was a reformation of man and
[58:16] that's you see the first part of
[58:18] reformation they manage the nomination
[58:19] so all the rest of informations they
[58:21] make a denomination I mean my program
[58:24] Cynthia dying land made there never
[58:26] become a denomination after this it says
[58:28] isn't in going for 17 odd years and has
[58:30] been denomination around it he says
[58:33] normally after three years their former
[58:34] denomination of my dog and why why did
[58:37] that why has it not denominator because
[58:40] we are back to it was in the beginning
[58:42] in the book of Acts is no talk of
[58:45] denomination of my main men amen and
[58:47] Paul fought against an ego he fought
[58:49] against the BCS is the beasts an
[58:51] emphasis fought against these ones and
[58:53] then even even your the Lord when he
[58:55] speaks the Ephesian age he says this one
[58:58] thing he says thou has the deeds doesn't
[59:01] have the deeds of Nicolaitans you know
[59:03] that thing I hate and his cannon
[59:05] commending them for standing against
[59:07] those people calling and saying that
[59:09] they have called themselves apostles for
[59:12] the liars you've tried them here's
[59:14] commending them not for going down that
[59:16] road the real believers but they are
[59:18] walking with God amen why is why isn't
[59:21] this enough
[59:23] because we've been restored back to the
[59:25] original back to the original back to
[59:28] the first age exactly the same way now
[59:35] I can find us
[59:37] oh yeah here now
[59:39] where we have been turned to the
[59:40] original atonement and the fire god has
[59:44] drowsiness people you seen the book of
[59:47] Acts all the healing and all the
[59:50] manifestations they had to see I would
[59:53] sign of an inward life and God well
[59:56] again them was the major side you see
[59:59] and all those things were just displace
[1:00:01] of that and you can see it because in
[1:00:06] the book of Acts God would God send to
[1:00:08] the people separate to me full of
[1:00:10] Barnabas it was a divine leadership
[1:00:12] among the believers and then when where
[1:00:15] Paul was going to go to Rome you know
[1:00:17] God anointed agamous to hang his guns
[1:00:20] and bind his hands and you know this man
[1:00:21] who is bama this girl's going to go to
[1:00:23] Roman how Phillips daughter's problem
[1:00:25] site all these different things and they
[1:00:27] were walking now walking with God as he
[1:00:30] was fulfilling his work because all
[1:00:34] garden Rome was part of his work you
[1:00:36] know those missionary journeys in the
[1:00:38] word going out that was all part of us
[1:00:40] working fulfilled as part of week your
[1:00:42] walk ride was doing and so the people
[1:00:45] were under divine leadership because it
[1:00:49] comes down it wasn't just them going
[1:00:51] around but they're under the violation
[1:00:53] of God because the scripture tells us
[1:00:54] they did a led by the Spirit of God are
[1:00:56] the sons of God amen and they were
[1:01:00] walking you say well there's lots of
[1:01:02] people that say God homes with us
[1:01:04] whatever more but you have to take it
[1:01:06] back to the scripture and if it really
[1:01:09] is God you can fight it in the scripture
[1:01:11] if you can't find it in the scripture
[1:01:13] I'd say leave it alone and pray about it
[1:01:16] until God reveals another scripture and
[1:01:18] then when he does that just walk off
[1:01:21] because if you can't type cut into here
[1:01:24] then you can make it say whatever you
[1:01:27] wanted to say and so you see the book of
[1:01:30] Acts are divinely lead and the only way
[1:01:33] there could have been a book of Acts now
[1:01:35] I might just the only way that they
[1:01:38] could have been a book of Acts was that
[1:01:40] first there had to be an Elijah ministry
[1:01:43] to point out the Lamb of God and in that
[1:01:46] life of that land now came and rather
[1:01:48] than the people that's the only way they
[1:01:50] can be a book of Acts be written was all
[1:01:52] those things to happen and it's the same
[1:01:55] thing in the end time now is that they
[1:01:57] had fought for the true book of Acts to
[1:01:59] be written as they had to cover in
[1:02:01] Elijah ministry to point out the lamp
[1:02:04] and the vindication that he pointed out
[1:02:06] the lamb is because the life of that lab
[1:02:08] now wells and the people amen amen how
[1:02:11] do you know this message is trip to the
[1:02:13] life of the scriptures and me thank you
[1:02:15] and it quickens me to this does it
[1:02:17] quicker me to some church manual or some
[1:02:19] man's ideas and quickens me to this
[1:02:21] that's how nice the lots of Jesus Christ
[1:02:23] and so that is why now if we took out
[1:02:28] took our lives I'll testimonies back
[1:02:30] into the book of Acts we would just be
[1:02:32] walking around with them a member it
[1:02:36] caused our lives are writing a book of
[1:02:38] Acts yeah
[1:02:41] our lives are writing a book about Wes
[1:02:43] right you say well I haven't seen anyone
[1:02:45] raised from the dead and God allow that
[1:02:48] to happen it would happen right I mean
[1:02:51] you don't have that it's not about a
[1:02:53] checklist of I've done all these things
[1:02:54] as the life in you and when the life is
[1:02:58] in you yields that life and then
[1:03:00] whatever God wants to do he'll thought
[1:03:02] I'm amen we're not here to try and twist
[1:03:06] God's up you know we are yielded to the
[1:03:10] Lord and when he says pray for this
[1:03:12] person speak to this person brings us a
[1:03:16] new strap I just felt great lead to read
[1:03:20] the scripture about lead to send this
[1:03:22] person to watch out for right this
[1:03:24] little pray for this one what does that
[1:03:27] is divided leadership yes sir amen and
[1:03:32] that is all because we have been turned
[1:03:35] we have been turned the real lamp
[1:03:41] now
[1:03:43] to be anointed what this earth
[1:03:46] as
[1:03:48] on your spirit only
[1:03:51] is not the true pinnacle
[1:03:55] you'll understand what i mean by the
[1:03:57] book of yo azusa street the gifts of the
[1:04:00] Spirit were a work of the spirit but it
[1:04:03] wasn't God dwelling in his people yeah
[1:04:06] and so just to be anointed it is not the
[1:04:11] same as God well again you grow and the
[1:04:14] true Pentecost was first God came and
[1:04:15] dwelt in them and then he manifested
[1:04:18] himself and then the word work for and
[1:04:21] people receive salvation and so this is
[1:04:25] why now we you see the bride worldwide
[1:04:30] doesn't matter about what other people
[1:04:32] are claiming to do it all this stuff on
[1:04:34] the both sides of the dudes I'm not
[1:04:36] talking about that talk about the real
[1:04:37] believer down around the world they have
[1:04:39] the same character they have the same
[1:04:42] sweetness they have the same humility
[1:04:45] amen because the same doesn't matter if
[1:04:47] you're in Africa or your pump with you
[1:04:49] good in your vanuatu Australia New
[1:04:51] Zealand will send after or England or
[1:04:53] America wherever it is it is the same
[1:04:55] life amen because brother brahim tells
[1:04:59] us he says he says the grain is here you
[1:05:04] know and when he would take it and she
[1:05:06] takes a scripture from I think it's mike
[1:05:07] with which Jesus actually says about the
[1:05:10] crystal ratio of the growing of a week
[1:05:12] life but first comes the stall him in
[1:05:15] the tassel and then the sugar than the
[1:05:17] ground he actually jesus lizard these
[1:05:20] things out on scripture and so that was
[1:05:22] a restoration of what was planted in the
[1:05:25] dark ages and the Pentecostal moved
[1:05:29] further than was a grain they feel that
[1:05:31] arrived but they they would just think
[1:05:33] Terry off the life and it's in our
[1:05:36] profit status slice in about 50
[1:05:39] learnings for the proper sentences the
[1:05:41] green is now here you see this is where
[1:05:43] we've arrived I meant at the same life
[1:05:46] that that diamond fell into the ground
[1:05:48] has come falls again they did and it's
[1:05:51] not a different it's not a lesser life
[1:05:54] you know Jesus was the first great the
[1:05:58] truck yep now if you can take
[1:06:03] so it tasted great
[1:06:07] and we are united with him that means we
[1:06:12] are the same quality great
[1:06:17] we are not elisa great
[1:06:20] what he has done for us and we're joint
[1:06:23] heirs with Christ we're not Alyssa we're
[1:06:26] not a single being great great we're a
[1:06:29] great team was a great we are a great
[1:06:33] we've been amen I'm just I'm already out
[1:06:37] basically but do you think about it we
[1:06:39] think you know he is amazing credible
[1:06:41] and how do we ever be like happen the
[1:06:44] reason we have response to help as for
[1:06:49] these are looking for part of himself
[1:06:52] yep he's looking he's looking for great
[1:06:54] this is I have a piece of grain where's
[1:06:57] the wall break the my god I must be full
[1:06:59] of great food and all of the father has
[1:07:02] given him welcome amen and there's a
[1:07:04] harvest is a gathering going on and the
[1:07:08] graders gathered into the bottom and the
[1:07:10] chaff in the you know all that stuff has
[1:07:14] been bound for the burning and so he's
[1:07:17] looking he's looking for parts of
[1:07:19] himself
[1:07:22] he's looking for something that's
[1:07:24] exactly like him hello
[1:07:28] whoever when he calls you that's like
[1:07:31] that's like you're Rebecca was was part
[1:07:36] of Isaac and so what you see in Isaac
[1:07:40] you seen Rebecca he gives us life she
[1:07:44] says old God just she just gives herself
[1:07:47] as other wishes go doesn't know who
[1:07:50] she's marrying you know just met this
[1:07:51] your le I said the other day she says
[1:07:54] all go and her family tried to hold her
[1:07:57] back stay another day you know a stab at
[1:08:01] longer but but he he he wouldn't delay
[1:08:04] he wouldn't delay is going because he's
[1:08:07] a faithful he's a faithful servant where
[1:08:10] he didn't have time to build an empire
[1:08:11] or some kingdom or some statues but he
[1:08:14] said I'm on a mission by finding a bride
[1:08:17] for my god for my master's son and so he
[1:08:22] he didn't delay and as soon as he found
[1:08:24] he he maybe send out let's go for senior
[1:08:28] and then and then since you're her
[1:08:29] family is trying to lay the guard and
[1:08:31] all these things and she just invited
[1:08:34] kind under the crunch Rebecca will you
[1:08:36] go she just gave yourself I would go you
[1:08:39] know who is I don't know who he is I've
[1:08:42] only just heard his name I heard about
[1:08:44] now angel look Calvin prepared me I mean
[1:08:47] I only just heard about this now I've
[1:08:49] already watered as camels I've already
[1:08:51] I've already given him a drink but now
[1:08:54] I've hit hearing testimony I'll an angel
[1:08:56] God will sit before this man and for
[1:08:59] some reason i responded when i saw a
[1:09:01] mess you know give you a drink and I'll
[1:09:03] give you a camera
[1:09:04] as you can say no I came under a
[1:09:07] supernatural of Lord amen I mean I just
[1:09:09] loved out that man's prayer hey you got
[1:09:13] read you can read Genesis rifle she had
[1:09:15] looked out his prayer and she doesn't
[1:09:17] even know him he prayed that way talk
[1:09:21] about a supernatural this supernatural
[1:09:24] at ain't thirsty is on 30 I am assisting
[1:09:27] of I wanted them to she was anointed
[1:09:31] amen to water to water those camels and
[1:09:35] she doesn't know that watering those
[1:09:38] camels those camels were going to do it
[1:09:40] too right away Khalid and we're here
[1:09:43] mother have says at the same Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] that we water without price and I were
[1:09:48] showing that we give Him glory remember
[1:09:51] giving it strength I mean to take us
[1:09:53] from this world into the next world yeah
[1:09:55] I mean when we praise the Lord we're
[1:09:57] watering most camel anyway I mean that
[1:09:59] power because a beast of burden as a
[1:10:02] power the scripture like a wharf the
[1:10:04] book of Revelation so that power we
[1:10:06] water and we give reverence to yeah we
[1:10:08] love is going to carry us away oh yeah
[1:10:11] because we're the full as a dispensation
[1:10:13] of time maybe they meant so that's how
[1:10:15] Isaac was reflected in Rebecca and then
[1:10:17] when they came together thank you amen
[1:10:20] Isaac they both recognized this is the
[1:10:23] part of me I'm looking at the other part
[1:10:26] of me amen repairing basil members she
[1:10:30] was kin kin to Isaac wasn't Alicia
[1:10:33] family wasn't blessed class and or
[1:10:36] whatever however want to put it over
[1:10:38] they work info they were blood relation
[1:10:41] you take that both brakes amen and here
[1:10:46] we are and God has called us and we have
[1:10:50] no but before we receive this word is
[1:10:52] that influence of angels are Potter amen
[1:10:55] all that influence it must be one life I
[1:10:58] satisfied with the slide it must be more
[1:11:01] to it than us because that is Angel's
[1:11:03] influencing you I mean they quicken a
[1:11:06] better scripture to you tell them
[1:11:08] because it's all real you're being
[1:11:08] driven and you can't exactly put it all
[1:11:11] together that is the Angels influence in
[1:11:14] your life amen to receive a visitation
[1:11:17] then the messages work comes your way he
[1:11:21] says now I'm going to show you to Isaac
[1:11:23] your account and use land all down to
[1:11:25] all go I'll Lou you amen
[1:11:30] amen and that is where we are

[1:12:23] but you know words the deep woods take a
[1:12:26] while to heal but as long as they're
[1:12:28] healing merely Council wrong with your
[1:12:30] taking medicine the you don't look at
[1:12:32] the mood anymore you just take the
[1:12:33] medicine so is it getting better I'm
[1:12:35] getting you even to show people I get
[1:12:37] scars and stuff look it's healing look
[1:12:39] at the stitches of falling out what time
[1:12:42] was bleeding everyone constant is here
[1:12:44] what's bleeding everywhere I said look
[1:12:46] at this is Col look it's all coming
[1:12:48] together you don't say oh I saw a
[1:12:49] murderous when terrible sure was it was
[1:12:52] terrible you know when you ruined it and
[1:12:54] Scotty on your skirt only six it was
[1:12:57] terrible through it I think comes a
[1:12:58] point now when you look at look how much
[1:13:00] is healing yeah better i'm getting hey
[1:13:02] Larry a min and you look at the positive
[1:13:05] effects that are going on because you're
[1:13:07] taking the medicine yeah they meant
[1:13:09] because you're taking the medicine so
[1:13:11] you know look at the scars look at what
[1:13:15] the medicine is doing to them
[1:13:17] he comes a point where you receive you
[1:13:20] all move it all back again and
[1:13:22] everything's just fine that you ever
[1:13:23] testimony yeah and he can use it as
[1:13:26] glory hey I mean the devil wounded me
[1:13:28] here but look what look what God has
[1:13:30] done for me yeah and then you can use
[1:13:32] that I can tell people knives are sharp
[1:13:33] be careful as a testimony amen and
[1:13:37] everything down in life he say that was
[1:13:39] terrible that happened or one thing
[1:13:42] about it why did he allow I don't know
[1:13:45] maybe you could mention it to someone
[1:13:47] else and they could not go down that
[1:13:49] road and they could have ended up a
[1:13:51] shipwreck amen and you can use those
[1:13:54] things for God's glory and up all them
[1:13:58] foul here now of course it takes wisdom
[1:14:00] to share things don't get me wrong but
[1:14:02] you know you could share look I stumbled
[1:14:05] and fell fell down into a deep cut for
[1:14:07] years I think God looked at me out
[1:14:09] that's right all i have is healed scars
[1:14:13] amen amen heels gather a sign of victory
[1:14:17] yes sir don't let it bow down don't let
[1:14:20] it clogged it down with a devil sake
[1:14:22] look what I hear you're used to do this
[1:14:24] and look how terrible your life walls
[1:14:25] analyzed up oh look at it that way I
[1:14:28] mean look as God delivered me sometimes
[1:14:32] yeah brother I'm tell the story like a
[1:14:33] shipyard like a sheep with I mean a
[1:14:36] shepherd and the shepherd broke a leg of
[1:14:40] one of his sheep and you know the guy
[1:14:44] goes shipping why would you do that to
[1:14:45] your sheep you see while he was straight
[1:14:47] it wasn't paying attention to my voice
[1:14:49] and I had to do this or allow this I can
[1:14:54] pick them up and I can nurse him and I
[1:14:57] can
[1:14:57] hit the brake and I'm combined it up and
[1:14:59] I've been show my life to that chick and
[1:15:02] look he loves me out yeah that's it
[1:15:05] towards the chip it but if you take it
[1:15:06] the right way that's how God allows
[1:15:08] things sometimes where we being in our
[1:15:12] little human running around me we don't
[1:15:16] listen and God allows us not to listen
[1:15:19] and with God's sovereign over everything
[1:15:21] the devil has nothing over amen you say
[1:15:26] well the devil trip me up there god
[1:15:28] never say to me before you take the
[1:15:31] women for God talk about job Satan had
[1:15:34] to get permission to do that to Jordan I
[1:15:37] mean
[1:15:39] and it's like everything before the
[1:15:41] devil comes your way Satan has asked
[1:15:45] your father about it first and your
[1:15:47] father has given him permission to do
[1:15:49] whatever he has to do and he has
[1:15:51] confidence in you and no matter how
[1:15:53] terrible may see you're going to come
[1:15:55] out the other and even better mean amen
[1:15:57] hey ever worked for over to work that's
[1:15:59] true for us and God allows that that
[1:16:04] then he can reveal himself in a great
[1:16:07] away a job sent one day you know I wish
[1:16:11] still as a man go no I wish I knew where
[1:16:14] God looked I'm just add loving but you
[1:16:17] know who the story is I wish I newbury
[1:16:18] look so I've got to his house I could
[1:16:20] talk to him speaking of God but there
[1:16:23] came a point where he said I've heard of
[1:16:25] thee but now I see thee and said I know
[1:16:28] my redeemer lover he says with these
[1:16:30] eyes I'll set upon the surf at all you
[1:16:33] know I'll stand by you I'll see God
[1:16:35] before they need to know those things I
[1:16:39] mean you say well it's terribly the
[1:16:42] losers family and lose all these
[1:16:45] God knew and also Joe sacrificed on
[1:16:51] behalf of his family I believe they had
[1:16:53] salvation amen but all that was just
[1:16:57] like the Shepherd the sainted was
[1:17:00] allowed to go after Joe that God could
[1:17:02] pick job up and reveal himself that joke
[1:17:06] can have a revelation of the
[1:17:07] resurrection
[1:17:10] sometimes we go through things as near
[1:17:14] for our good we are under standard this
[1:17:17] is all because mo where the dispensation
[1:17:21] of the fullest apart better people must
[1:17:24] live out what's in here and so people
[1:17:27] have to live out jobs experience people
[1:17:30] have to live out Moses experience i SAT
[1:17:33] writing from God like Jonah he ran from
[1:17:36] God end up in a belly of a whale you
[1:17:39] know people people run from God and it
[1:17:43] and it's done in such a way God allows
[1:17:45] it to happen that god can reveal himself
[1:17:48] in a greater way we're just like Abraham
[1:17:52] people the in time have to look up what
[1:17:55] Abraham did I mean that they have to
[1:17:58] leave it leave with a frog go to a
[1:18:01] strange land I'm not gonna magic
[1:18:03] geographically too much spiritually
[1:18:05] leave this leave this land leave this
[1:18:08] denomination leave this religion
[1:18:10] whatever it is and I'll show you another
[1:18:12] place to go and God has done that amen
[1:18:18] because all those things Bengal down the
[1:18:20] Bible make bound together now and
[1:18:22] there's a people that are living out
[1:18:25] those stories that were just some type
[1:18:26] of doubtful
[1:18:29] I'm ever just sleep in it shall be
