[0:00] he's no no it is God who gives you that
[0:03] desire and then he provide the
[0:06] desire I mean if it's done
[0:09] properly if it's done on the heart that
[0:12] has been anointed by the spirit of God
[0:13] and the Stony heart is he gives you the
[0:15] heart that is why sister hat
[0:18] right that is why sister right when the
[0:21] prophet said sister you ask anything
[0:25] that you will right
[0:27] now I mean a normal human being desire
[0:31] he even the prophet gave him the clue he
[0:34] said sister you can ask for for a
[0:36] million you can ask for this for this
[0:37] for this carnal
[0:39] things but God God provided a desire for
[0:43] her that's right and then he made her to
[0:46] request that desire are
[0:48] you are you following me Hallelujah so I
[0:53] I I wrote here and I
[0:55] said in because in our own human
[0:58] capacity and will our will our human
[1:01] ability our capability it is actually
[1:04] impossible to worship God it is
[1:07] impossible to worship God according to
[1:10] his
[1:11] will and his will is capacity his Godly
[1:16] capacity in in our own way we that is
[1:19] why he must remove the heart so that we
[1:22] can be able to worship Him according to
[1:25] his
[1:28] will according to his desire desire for
[1:30] us that is why he needs to do that in
[1:33] our own there's many there's many who
[1:36] are worshiping there's many even the
[1:38] Bible says in that day many are going to
[1:41] say Lord Lord didn't I do this in your
[1:44] name did not I do this did I not heal
[1:47] people did I not do this of course you
[1:49] did of course they did it's not us none
[1:52] of us there will be those ones who will
[1:54] be saying that but because H this
[1:57] reminds me of the message that the
[1:58] prophet preached about
[2:00] doing God a service without his without
[2:02] it being his will you see everything
[2:05] that we do we must make sure that our
[2:09] desire is a god provided one is aligned
[2:13] with God's desire for you amen are we
[2:16] together why why I say he will give you
[2:19] the right desire of your heart is that
[2:21] we have many desires that is we've got
[2:24] many desires we've got many needs and
[2:27] wants some don't necessarily go
[2:29] according to word as I've already said
[2:31] so the question is what is your desire
[2:35] and why that
[2:37] desire there's primary desires there's
[2:40] secondary desires you know there's deep
[2:42] desires there's shallow desires there's
[2:45] the needs there's
[2:46] wants you know there's wish lists at my
[2:50] workplace sometimes we have a meeting
[2:51] they say oh what's what's on your budget
[2:53] list I hear that term here here in New
[2:56] Zealand for the first time call they say
[2:58] what's on your bucket list as a bucket
[3:00] list for the first time I got
[3:02] lost then I learn I learned a bucket
[3:05] list mean a wish list if you
[3:09] say let me not dive it so some needs are
[3:13] shallow some are deep some are really
[3:19] heavy everyone has got desires needs
[3:23] wants in economics we talk about there's
[3:24] a need and there's a
[3:26] want so a want is something that you can
[3:30] live without a need is almost like
[3:32] something that you really need you
[3:34] almost cannot you need to live you need
[3:37] this thing you need water that is your
[3:41] need you need food you need
[3:46] clothes but you see I need that specific
[3:50] jacket it's no more a need it's a
[3:53] one can you see where desires can so my
[3:58] my my my desire
[4:00] should be aligned to what God's desire
[4:03] for me is for that
[4:07] thing I want to be a little bit slow
[4:10] tonight Brother David I don't want to
[4:12] rush but how can we show that our hearts
[4:15] most important desire are aligned with
[4:17] God's God's God's word God's heart how
[4:20] can we ensure that how can I make sure
[4:24] that God's need desire for
[4:27] me is aligned
[4:31] so this bringing to brings me to the
[4:33] point of saying okay on on Sunday my
[4:36] Sunday school class will remember and I
[4:38] deviated a lot but if you hear me
[4:41] touching on something that we spoke just
[4:43] say
[4:44] Amen if you remember what what is our
[4:47] purpose here on Earth why do we
[4:52] exist I want to show you that God had a
[4:56] desire the the the whole thing how it
[4:59] started
[5:00] even before God was God because there
[5:04] was a time when God was not God are we
[5:07] there but then he had a desire he had a
[5:10] need he had certain things in him that
[5:13] oh I've got these things but I I want to
[5:15] bring them out that's right and they
[5:18] started to think because you see God's
[5:20] thoughts are real they are not like my
[5:22] thoughts where I just they're not
[5:25] imagination God's thoughts are not
[5:27] imagination God's thoughts are are real
[5:31] like more than this thing yes this thing
[5:34] is just air but God's things are God's
[5:38] thoughts are real then he started to
[5:40] think then about you you emerged he
[5:45] started to to deliberately purposefully
[5:49] think about Hey Na oh yes and I wanted
[5:52] to be this way this way this country at
[5:55] this time Lou he said God took his time
[5:59] to started to think because he had
[6:02] desires he had certain attributes he had
[6:05] certain things in him and he said then
[6:08] then he said how am I going to fulfill
[6:10] those ones he started to have a desire
[6:13] to want to be
[6:14] God in that process he started to think
[6:17] about you that is why we say we were
[6:20] there with him before the foundation of
[6:22] the world that's what we mean because in
[6:24] his thought is is as real more than what
[6:28] we live the life that we call live here
[6:31] it's just that right now because of this
[6:33] limit we can't
[6:35] remember that we were there in the
[6:38] before the foundation of the earth
[6:40] before the Earth was created you he said
[6:42] oh fish I'm going to even tell him tell
[6:45] them to give him a nickname called fish
[6:47] philli he going to be fish Ben and then
[6:50] BB is going to be this one and then he
[6:53] thought about you he took time and he
[6:55] deliberately on purpose
[6:59] because he had a desire he had a desire
[7:02] to be a Healer he had a desire to be God
[7:05] he had a desire to be a father he had a
[7:07] desire he had desires and he wanted to
[7:09] fulfill those desires then then he he
[7:12] created
[7:14] you then you came to exist in God's mind
[7:18] right how many amens
[7:21] this uh because uh um what did I write
[7:27] here I was on the point of why do we
[7:30] exist that that is the very that is the
[7:33] very essence of why we exist on Earth
[7:37] right now why we exist is because of
[7:40] this explanation that I've just given
[7:42] you now that oh it was I can't say it's
[7:45] God's fault it was God's plan it was
[7:48] God's thoughts right now you exist
[7:51] everything that I I represent I see here
[7:54] is supposed to be actually fulfilling
[7:57] that desire for God are we
[8:01] together okay I'll confirm it for you
[8:03] let's
[8:05] read ecclesiastics I always struggle
[8:08] with this one e
[8:20] Ecclesiastes thank you
[8:22] brother chapter 12 I'll go slow tonight
[8:25] and then very soon we'll be done um
[8:31] 12 verse 7 listen to that
[8:36] one H I always like not to read on the
[8:40] computer but on my
[8:41] Bible 12 verse 7 are we all
[8:46] there are you listening young people
[8:49] young people are you listening to me I
[8:51] don't want to call you by name and I
[8:52] don't want to intimidate you I just want
[8:55] to be the nicest brother or uncle but I
[8:58] want you to attend L listen to what I'm
[9:00] reading
[9:02] now then shall the dust
[9:06] return to the Earth as it
[9:09] was and this remember the dust is just
[9:12] this this is not you this was not
[9:15] featuring anywhere when even
[9:17] God it was not the thoughts that I'm
[9:19] talking about this came later when God
[9:23] this this the flesh came later on right
[9:26] that is why he says the flesh will
[9:28] return to
[9:30] where it was to the Earth where it was
[9:32] and the spirit shall return unto God who
[9:34] gave
[9:36] it right listen to this vanity of
[9:40] vanities said the preacher all is Vanity
[9:44] so we want to make sure that our desires
[9:46] are not part of the vanity
[9:49] yeah and I'm not saying your desires
[9:52] Earthly desires are wrong all I'm saying
[9:55] is that they need to be aligned with
[9:57] God's desires first God's desire
[10:00] then my desire my desires becomes
[10:02] primary
[10:03] secondary right the moment your desires
[10:06] are aligned with God's desires then you
[10:09] are
[10:12] sorted I'm looking for this verse let's
[10:15] jump to verse
[10:19] 13 the verse 13 can I read it for you
[10:23] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[10:25] matter therefore if I was even a Bible
[10:28] writer I was going to say therefore you
[10:29] know that word therefore it's like
[10:31] you're you're closing therefore sister
[10:34] Naomi let us now let us hear the
[10:37] conclusion of the whole matter matter is
[10:41] anything that has
[10:44] got what is matter students K what is
[10:48] matter anything that
[10:52] has Mama help the children teacher
[10:55] matter is anything that has got that can
[10:58] occupy a space
[11:00] and substance right anything substance
[11:03] you students are forgetting so the the
[11:06] whole the the the end to the whole
[11:08] matter whatever is matter the end the
[11:11] conclusion of everything is
[11:14] this fear
[11:17] God
[11:19] comma and keep his
[11:22] Commandments for this is the whole not
[11:26] partly this is the whole Duty of man
[11:30] this this this this this thing that the
[11:33] whole
[11:36] matter your whole existence your whole
[11:40] plan
[11:42] everything the conclusion of it is that
[11:46] fear
[11:47] God and keep all
[11:50] his because you've got a new heart M
[11:53] isn't it he gave you a new heart he gave
[11:56] you a new heart and through that heart
[11:58] in your own heart Stone one of this
[12:01] flesh we can't so once we've got a new
[12:03] heart he give you the new spirit the
[12:05] whole matter that spirit and that heart
[12:07] is going to make you to come to to align
[12:10] with this
[12:13] conclusion you're agreeing with
[12:15] me for God shall bring every work into
[12:20] judgment with every secret thing whether
[12:23] it be good or it be evil but my point
[12:27] here is that the conclusion of the whole
[12:30] matter is that it reminds me of a
[12:32] scripture that says seek ye first the
[12:35] kingdom of God
[12:39] first
[12:41] amen I'm going to be very slow
[12:44] tonight and uh I want to read for you
[12:47] here where the
[12:48] preacher Reverend Brenham said in the
[12:52] spoken we
[12:53] expectation he said if there's a desire
[12:56] to worship God if there is a desire to
[12:58] worship God even the hot and to and
[13:01] Indians in Years Gone by you know the
[13:03] hot and to there in Africa there in the
[13:07] years has gone by they worshiped
[13:09] objects because the very creation of
[13:13] worship was in their heart and they
[13:16] worship
[13:17] something they worship something as
[13:20] their
[13:21] creator and that showed that there was a
[13:24] Creator somewhere to worship a God
[13:28] that's the whole whole purpose of a
[13:30] human being if you find a human being
[13:33] who does not want to worship
[13:35] God you know that they've lost the whole
[13:38] purpose why they
[13:40] exist because that's the whole reason
[13:43] why God thought about you and he knew
[13:45] that you are going to do it that's why
[13:47] he thought about you he knew that you
[13:51] are going to fulfill with the purpose of
[13:53] the whole
[13:54] matter and he cre he thought about you
[13:57] he made you the way he made you and he
[13:59] chose you because he knew that you are
[14:01] going to first of
[14:04] all put him first worship because that's
[14:07] where everything is going to come out I
[14:09] was teaching the kids there I said hey
[14:13] if God we say God is
[14:16] his he's everything don't we sing that
[14:19] song and then we say we but we want
[14:23] things in our lives we
[14:26] want things and God is
[14:30] every and we want things in our lives
[14:33] right we don't want to remain with
[14:36] n and God is every and we want
[14:41] some sometimes we want
[14:44] everything you heard about the needs and
[14:46] the ones if I can tell you now I go to a
[14:48] family I say sister Joe what do you want
[14:50] I'll get a long list hey my sister I'll
[14:52] get a long list if she comes to me and
[14:54] ask what do you want Oh man she'll get
[14:57] A4 this both sides doublesided because
[15:01] we've got needs and desires and
[15:02] everything but this is this is the key
[15:05] thing if we want to want everything or
[15:08] desire everything that we want but
[15:11] actually we can just take
[15:14] God and then we've got
[15:17] everything that's right you see because
[15:19] because he's got if God is is
[15:22] everything and then we want some things
[15:25] then we just take him wholeheartedly the
[15:27] way the scripture says and then because
[15:29] in him there's everything the only
[15:31] difference is that this time everything
[15:34] is going to go according to this perfect
[15:36] will perfect underline that perfect who
[15:40] doesn't want a perfect receiving of
[15:43] something you know if you want a a dress
[15:46] a perfect one who doesn't want a perfect
[15:49] can you imagine that God would would be
[15:52] careful that you get that dress that you
[15:54] you you want because he ordained to be
[15:57] that way that is why I'm not I don't
[15:59] understand when people
[16:00] say no no go Jesus is just in the heart
[16:04] don't worry about the
[16:06] outside God is careful about everything
[16:10] amen everything he even was very careful
[16:13] to design the shape of your hair and how
[16:15] it will that's why that is why little
[16:17] Gabriel can't look like exactly at the D
[16:20] God is very careful he made B this way
[16:23] and Maggi but he knew Gabriel is coming
[16:26] he designed him this way so that because
[16:29] you are and the reason why each and
[16:32] every one of you is unique is because is
[16:35] because God you are special God took
[16:38] time to think about you he didn't think
[16:41] about me and then he think about someone
[16:43] by by the way no each and everyone God
[16:48] was very careful that your fingerprints
[16:50] your is it they call it the iris in the
[16:53] eye that there certain things in our
[16:56] bodies in nature they just show that God
[17:00] he purposefully created and thought
[17:03] about you even science man science to
[17:06] some extent I think they use Faith but
[17:08] they don't know that is
[17:11] faith if science can believe that ah we
[17:14] can make we can make something like a
[17:16] bed that can fly and and and they they
[17:19] persevere and they make it the right
[17:22] brothers and they make that thing it
[17:23] fall they make it they were using Faith
[17:26] so if if if faith for a human being to
[17:29] make a microphone something I can speak
[17:32] here and then it is audible there if
[17:34] faith can do that caral
[17:36] Faith how much more about this Faith
[17:39] you're talking about that is the one
[17:41] that God used to create the heavens and
[17:42] the Earth it's so powerful it's so
[17:45] powerful that to to not realize that
[17:48] faith is a substance man you must go to
[17:51] your knees man it is the evidence
[17:58] let's just continue and finish here we
[18:00] owe all our existence to worship and
[18:03] fellowship with
[18:05] him because otherwise he wouldn't have
[18:08] created us God wouldn't have made you
[18:11] and me if he knew that you're are not
[18:14] going to worship him in his purpose he
[18:18] would have because there there did
[18:21] somewhere where there say it says
[18:23] somewhere created to be just to be
[18:25] thrown away to be destroyed some were
[18:29] created to go to life some
[18:32] too that is why I'm saying God is a
[18:34] strange
[18:35] God don't ask me why he said he he he's
[18:40] a strange God and he doesn't want us to
[18:41] worship the god the strange
[18:45] Gods we owe all our existence to his
[18:48] Fellowship to his glory to worship Him
[18:51] the moment we put him as number one of
[18:54] all
[18:55] things our desires our everything is
[18:58] going to come from there amen our
[19:01] everything because he is everything to
[19:04] you he may not be everything to somebody
[19:06] but to you he is everything and
[19:09] everything that you saw
[19:12] desire he saw that he had certain
[19:15] qualities or I already spoke about this
[19:16] let me not repeat myself
[19:19] now a fully surrendered
[19:23] heart in order to clearly align your
[19:26] needs and your desires and everything we
[19:28] need need a full fully surrendered heart
[19:33] and
[19:34] life that's when God will then starts to
[19:37] make be a mechanic and take out that
[19:40] heart put a new heart because we are
[19:42] fully surrendered fully surrendered is
[19:45] that in other words you gave up on
[19:47] yourself you give up you come to a point
[19:50] in your life where you say I
[19:55] I then you once you give up and you
[19:57] surrender he knows because he was there
[19:59] when he was created he created you and
[20:01] he made you said then then he knows that
[20:05] ah she has reached now and then
[20:09] everything is done now now you you are
[20:11] now you are you you are be called No
[20:14] More em you are becoming you are now a
[20:17] what we call an amature God you are an
[20:20] amateure God you are you are a the world
[20:23] depends on
[20:24] you did I say that that listen
[20:29] if God can just remove us now here on
[20:31] this Earth it's
[20:34] done it's chaos that you'll never never
[20:37] never want to be here so you and
[20:40] me because the Holy Ghost is here the
[20:43] moment he takes us and change our bodies
[20:46] and we go home it's done so that which
[20:49] means that we've got so much power that
[20:53] we don't
[20:55] realize what we
[20:57] have if I give you a billion
[21:01] dollar and I say now here I'll come back

[22:12] get so mad that no you can't do this to
[22:14] me do you know who you're dealing
[22:17] with they so mad with the devil so angry
[22:21] that you you go to God and say I want
[22:24] leave this to me let me deal with the
[22:27] devil according to your way
[22:29] oh you get so mad because he likes
[22:33] playing tennis ball with us and we give
[22:37] it to him so easily and sometimes we and
[22:42] we forget who we are we mustn't our

[24:34] because it's a long seat at the back
[24:36] where we even sitting on top of each
[24:38] other at the back there and one thing we
[24:40] know our fathers don't have eyes
[24:44] here that's why we like back seat when

[24:49] journey some of you are still at the
[24:51] back but you are in the same bus so I
[24:53] want you to hear me
[24:55] correctly to love the front seat yeah to
[24:58] have a plan to be in the

[25:04] seat and you are joshuas you are
[25:08] calebs let's
[25:11] close I want to close with this
[25:16] one think about the children of
[25:19] Israel okay before we come to them let
[25:22] me read this for you from the believer's
[25:24] position in Christ preached in
[25:27] 5516
[25:29] 16 he
[25:31] says and Paul not by
[25:35] desire don't let it don't let it pass
[25:37] above your head not by desire
[25:40] of not by
[25:42] choice not by the will of man or his own
[25:46] human desire but by the will of God he
[25:49] was an apostle we need some more like
[25:55] that by the will of God he was on his
[25:59] road to Damascus to
[26:03] arrest I don't know how many of you had
[26:06] that I'll read it again by the will of
[26:08] God he was on his road to Damascus to
[26:11] arrest by the will of
[26:14] God think of it was going to arrest the
[26:18] very group that he was sent to be the
[26:21] Apostle
[26:24] off now you see how upside down it looks
[26:28] like in the human
[26:31] element that God does things God does
[26:35] things that is why God is not to be
[26:39] understood or to be analyzed and to be
[26:43] processed in this way no no God is to be
[26:47] believed full
[26:50] stop he's to be believed that's all
[26:54] not otherwise you get you'll confuse
[26:57] yourself and and be everywhere and and
[27:00] just be perplexed
[27:02] everywhere just the very things that you
[27:04] think that you won't
[27:06] do that may be the very things that
[27:11] you but remember you've got a
[27:13] billion I want you to remember this
[27:16] you've got more than a billion without
[27:18] money without price no billion can
[27:21] afford you
[27:23] Asha you've got
[27:25] it no matter what daddy says you've got
[27:30] billion more than a billion dollars it's
[27:34] yours that's not the point of discussion
[27:36] what friends are saying at school
[27:38] whoever wants to try just just tell him
[27:40] that my friend by the way I just want to
[27:43] let you know I'm a son of the king if
[27:46] you want to be my brother be nice to me
[27:49] just just remind your friends hey
[27:52] actually I I I'm the one who's supposed
[27:55] to be helping you because I've got
[27:56] something that is more expensive
[27:58] amen you better share Lun with me I'm
[28:01] joking don't say
[28:03] that sorry it's not a place to joke but
[28:06] I'm trying to emphasize a point that no
[28:09] devil must intimidate you at school amen
[28:13] no no I remember many many years ago my
[28:15] father said to me
[28:18] hey look at me I said yeah he said be a
[28:22] stupid because that's what they call
[28:24] there out there cool
[28:26] wise clever
[28:28] until the very SE they call it wise and
[28:30] cool
[28:32] cool he said to me be a
[28:36] stupid for
[28:39] Jesus you know to be a a fool for
[28:42] Jesus is way way way better than to be
[28:45] the to be an
[28:47] Einstein yeah the person with the most
[28:50] high top highq IQ here to be a fool
[28:54] because you have taken the very core of
[28:56] the matter you have it
[28:58] yeah so I'm saying to you brothers and
[29:00] sisters in losing I want to encourage
[29:02] you to say think about the children of
[29:06] Israel you know some people here on
[29:08] Earth we've got desires some needs
[29:11] healing some needs strength someone
[29:14] needs food money protection housing jobs
[29:17] satisfaction wisdom you can think think
[29:21] wild we need all those things but I to
[29:24] as I told
[29:26] you you don't have to worry about all
[29:28] those he knows you need them just have
[29:32] him once you have him you've got all
[29:36] those
[29:37] things because we saying he everything
[29:39] to us think about let's close with the
[29:42] children children of Israel when they
[29:44] were on a journey from Egypt to the
[29:45] promised land did you realize did you
[29:48] ever pause and think and realize that
[29:49] he's he's everything he was everything
[29:51] to them if you need heat right now in
[29:55] this room he is he does not even need
[29:57] brother KU went to hustle and go buy us
[29:59] more put them around the No No he can
[30:02] bring heat without this airons and and
[30:05] make this room
[30:06] warm he's everything sinen and seen good
[30:11] and evil he's the core he's the source
[30:14] but the reason is he created everything
[30:17] to bring glory and honor and some things
[30:20] with the human mind when you look at
[30:22] them it's almost like you say ah was God
[30:25] evil no he was not evil but he allowed
[30:28] evil for his honor and
[30:30] Glory but there's a th bread group of
[30:33] people which is
[30:35] you that he made on his side I just want
[30:40] you to take this with you at home that
[30:42] he's everything to
[30:44] you if you
[30:46] need to
[30:49] sleep you can sleep he's your sleep he's
[30:53] your peace he's your
[30:55] everything he he if I don't know how I
[30:58] can overemphasize this but his main
[31:01] desire is for you to desire him
[31:06] first then once you've you've done that
[31:09] you've got everything now everything is
[31:11] no more is just according to to the time
[31:14] and plan of God and the plan and the
[31:17] timetable and it will
[31:19] come you you want a wife or you want a
[31:22] husband or you want a a a car you want a
[31:27] job you you can even specify Lord I want
[31:30] a job with this
[31:32] salary he can give it to
[31:35] you he will I've got testimonies of
[31:37] people who said Lord I
[31:40] mean have you ever had I mean Shak

[32:02] seen this is
[32:05] funny and it turns out that on that day

[32:10] something you know so God is a strange
[32:13] God and he works on both sides don't
