service Lord may your spirit just minister to us this evening as we Sur rer ourselves and our lives to you Lord in Jesus wonderful name amen amen praise the Lord thank you musicians thank you brother Josh it was nice I was hoping for a nice uh song service to create a nice atmosphere because I've had a bit of I woke up this morning a we bit tired and it's not the greatest thing to wake up tired because our natural man uh maybe isn't as longsuffering as we would like him or her to be was that just me so it feels like I've been yelling at people all day but I don't think I have it just feels like I have maybe I yelled in my mind but my better sense enabled me to not yell and yet in my mind maybe I think I was but you know they when we get in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that changes everything you know and and that's what we want to do is to live in the atmosphere atmosphere of the Holy Ghost I won't keep you standing long let's um let's turn in our Bibles to Ephesians 3:8 it says unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him amen amen may God bless is where you can take your seats um this evening amen the thought that I want to speak on this evening is a thought called unworthy um yet worthy amen so how you feeling you're feeling good very good I was moving so fast today I forgot to eat food so I got home and there was my emergency supply of food and it's these um smoothie drinks for diabetics I think they've gone all through the church and nobody wants them but I still I'm still a willing participant and these drinks come courtesy of brother Phil CU he has his operation so he's got to live on these smoothies I don't think even he doesn't like them but you read on the packet it says on the bottle it's got 27 essential minerals and vitamins and it's a complete food in itself I thought that'll do I had two of them for dinner complete food I'm going to mention to brother Phil you know if he um when I when my Supply runs a bit low maybe you could quickly just have another operation and get a whole bunch more I don't know if you'd be so obliging um but you know the word of God I'm I'm glad that the word of God is a complete food in itself you know that's actually all that we need for our soul is the word of God the the Lord said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen and this thought that I have I pray that I could deliver it in the inspiration that I received it in you know it's often a hard thing for ministers when you're in your you you may not always be in your quiet place you may be driving you may be somewhere then you just get this bit of inspiration and something moves your heart you know and it often times it can move you to tears or move you to Rejoice or whatever the inspiration whatever the emotion of the inspiration might be you know you sort of you catch something and then then you feel like you at some point in time you have to deliver that and you try to you hope that you know when I go to delivering this that I can capture that same emotion that same feeling that that I had when I received it you know because I I mean it would just be words if it all the word of God is true but you know we want that we want the spirit that was delivered in and and I've I've enjoyed um this this thought behind this one and you know this idea of unworthy you often times in my life I felt unworthy has anyone ever had that sort of feeling you know we look at ourselves and we often times when we end up at the feet of the Cross or calling out to the Lord is because often times we've usually come to the end of ourselves you know and we we've tried a lot of things we think we're good we think we can do this and we can do that and then eventually we find out that we can't and we realize that Lord I just need some help and we we come to the Lord just asking for help so we turn up very unworthy you know we've maybe tried everything else and we we turn up unworthy and we've got nothing really that we can bring to the table yeah now it's like if there was some sort of uh a business deal maybe that we wanted some to to purchase some sort of business and we it will be like us going to the business owner but turning up at the table with no money no we haven't tried that business before no nothing they saying look we want the whole business though we just we just want it you know we're sort of unworthy to even get it we don't have anything that would Merit that we should receive it or anything but and yet that's the way we turn up with the Lord is we turn up unworthy RAR you know and if we haven't turned up that way maybe we haven't turned up the right way yet yeah you know so so in ourselves in our natural our natural man or woman we we have this feeling that we're unworthy and then and then God being such a good God just does things for us sometimes you know and maybe we haven't been the greatest and yet some good things just happen to us and we think Lord I'm So Unworthy of this you know what why do I do these things and yet you just pour your goodness out upon me you know I think of that story I forget the man's name but he was a used to do a bit of hunting and that the the um colored brother and I think I think he shot a whole bunch of animals one day and he thought to himself he thought Lord you must love me look I just I'm not even really serving you not doing anything you just give me all this game I believe I serve you you know he realized Lord I'm just unworthy but you just do these good things for me that that that love overwhelmed him but yet you know part of our Christian walk or part of being a Christian is realizing but you are worthy that you do actually have value like you can't live your whole Christian walk thinking I'm unworthy I've got no value because if if you if you actually didn't have any value then the Lord wouldn't come and die for you that's right therefore there was a a perfect life came to die for you if you were the only one on Earth that would he would die for you amen therefore that places some sort of value upon you you have value you're not just a nobody that is worth nothing you you must be worth a lot if the god of Heaven would be willing to pay the ultimate price which was his life to to purchase you you must be worth a lot you know we thank you Lord more so than that we're not just uh we realized Lord we can't just go about thinking well I'm just I'm Just a Nobody just a sinner saved by grace well that's correct but then there's another part of us it has to realize we maybe I'm more than that may maybe I'm a maybe I'm a Son of God maybe I'm part of this whole inheritance maybe maybe I'm part of this whole family that's right even more than that I'm not just a A handmaid or this I'm actually a bride of this almighty God I'm actually I'm a part of this I I have an inheritance this thing belongs to me it's it's it's far different than turning up thinking we're unworthy and I deserve nothing to actually realizing at some point but I am worthy yes sir and and I want to speak tonight about these two sort of places that we go in our mind to on one hand we're unworthy which is true you know and it's if you want to get anywhere with God you got to realize you're unworthy you know that's that's the way when you come humble and and and realize you're nothing before the Lord then he can use you but you know on the other hand we realize that but but I am worthy otherwise the devil will keep tripping you're up the whole way along and you you won't claim all the promises of God for your life okay so I'm going to speak in a type tonight so I'm going to take us through a a story and it's going to be a I'm going to preach in the type so I'm going to have a story and the story that I um the story that I want to speak in a type of is the story of um Ruth and Naomi which is an unusual um story for me because I usually pick a king but it's good it's good this one we want to talk about this is a story about Ruth I'm just going to give you a bit of background but you all know the story but and then when we get to a certain point then I'll put the types in okay and I believe you'll be blessed so here in this picture we have um imik and Naomi and her two sons now there was a famine in the land of Israel and the economy wasn't doing so good so they left that land and went across to a place called Moab which was if you can see in this picture here Moab wasn't too far away but they had to journey across outside of Israel into Moab to um work and do things there that hoping that it would be a better life for them there now while they were there the two Sons met two uh women of Moab one by the name of Ruth and one by the name of Ora and they married these one brother married one of these women and another brother married the other and life for them was going along quite well then it says here and they took them wives of the woman of Moab the name of the one was Opa and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelt about 10 years and Maron and chilon died also both of them and the woman was left with her left of her two sons and her husband so before that the husband passed away and then her two sons passed away so Naomi was left with these two daughters of um Moab so she's in a Strange Land with these two daughters of Moab okay now this is where we're gonna put our spiritual thinking caps on and go into our spiritual type okay because we're going to run it all the way through and it's about being unworthy yet worthy okay so Ruth in this story is going to be typed as our Earthly uh body and as far as I can see we all have one of those and it generally is the thing that gives us all the problems you know as Paul said oh Wicked Richard man who that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death when when he'd been tormented by it so long but that's this Earthly body that we find ourselves in that's the five senses that's the a mind that works and everything that's our this is our Earthly body the second type I want to use in the story is Naomi and I want to type Naomi as Ruth's Celestial body or her theophany which is which is the same thing because you know we have a we have a Celestial body already waiting for us so we have our Earthly body here but we have our our Celestial body that is waiting for us when this one finishes we have a Celestial body and then the final body we have is our glorified body which is everything which is this flesh redeemed and that it's all together as our our our glorified body right but but we have our Celestial body or our theophany we all have one if we have representation right if this body be dissolved we have another one already waiting we meaning the bride okay now this may seem strange but the husbands that died I want to I I want to type them as the word for the hour any hour not that the word for the hour dies but it's a you know things take place and then we have to really find out who is this word what's behind this word then you know we have to we want to find out more than just the we want to hear more than just a man speaking we want to find out what's the voice behind the voice so it's in that sense that it died not saying the word died okay the other one I didn't put in here but I think it's applicable is emik can actually be typed as God okay okay because emik went away as well you you think well that's strange but I thought about it I thought yeah that kind of works all the way through because at the end when Boaz redeemed him he said I'm claiming all that was emik and all that was Naomi I'm claiming the whole thing he said all that the father has given me will come I'm going to claim the whole thing all poers given to me so he actually he actually redeemed everything that that belongs to em emik all right okay all right and I'm going to type or as the church natural with no Celestial body okay because Ora just heard that word and then when when when hardship arose when something happened when when maybe there was a fuss in the church or something she she she turned away she didn't because she didn't actually have any representation of what was behind that word who it was what was there okay so now if we go on this with this in mind then then the scene is set where we have we have Ruth and Naomi uh Ruth Naomi and Ora now Ruth is not from Moab H sorry Naomi is not from Moab she is from another land yeah she's from the promised land okay and Ruth is from Moab she's a she's from not the promised land she's not part of that inheritance not part of that Kingdom and so is Opa now you you following me so far okay you you this is very simple this is not don't let Satan tell you that the word of God is hard and types are hard and that they're not they're very the word of God is very simple okay it's very it's very it's just when when the Lord when Jesus preached he just preached about the sewer sa went forth to se seeds he kept it nice and simple okay so now these Ora and Ruth had both heard the word of God okay via uh Naomi from this and Via am from this other land they'd heard word and they they were rejoicing in it they they' received it they were happy but then at some point something happened and and maybe they had to go through a bit of hardship maybe things happen and that and they and so the challenge was laid out Naomi said look it's not working for me I'm going to head back to my land where I come from you two stay here I'm going to go back now Ora took her up on that proposition because Ora maybe couldn't she didn't like all the having to wear these dresses and do these things and all this sort of stuff and all these rules regulations when she thought about it she thought I'm not really too keen on this really she when she waited up she thought yeah well moab's not so bad you know this land that they've talked about I've never been there never really seen it hey I I'll take my chances and just stick around here I know family here it's it's this is more comfortable for me but you see the reason why she did that is because she didn't have a theophany she didn't have a representation from the other land that's right she had no representation so that her that meant nothing that this word of God although she heard it maybe rejoiced in it for a season it didn't really mean anything to her when it came to actually digging a bit deeper and and getting to the land where it came from because remember that word came from the promised land okay it came from there when it came to that nothing in her seemed to want it and yet Ruth when this happened when Naomi said I'm going to go back to my land you stay here because she had representation from there she said I don't understand this but there's something in me that's going to head back that way even though it's all seems to have gone wrong and I've suffered all this hardship there's something in that land that I want Hallelujah that that I'm that that's just a part of me somehow I don't know what it is I don't know why but Hallelujah there's something there for me come on she had representation there was something calling her now she didn't know what it was she'd never been there didn't see any photos didn't know anyone else here apart from the three that the her husband that had passed away and yet she she just wanted it so strongly that Ruth said she said to Naomi and this is a this is a verse that I think all of us Believers will speak the same as Peter spoke Lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God God I don't want this God of Moab amen I don't want this whatever is here I want your God am it doesn't matter if everything looks like it's falling apart there's something in that land there's something in that promise that I want I want that don't tell me to leave cuz I'm getting that cuz she was actually a part of Naomi she just there was where Naomi was from was where she was supposed to end up cuz where our theophany is is where we're supposed to end up even though at some point we're out in the world and Moab we're supposed to end up over there so there's a connection that's pulling us all the time as brother benam said you heard from your theophany it's just it's calling you where thou dest will I die and there will I also be buried and the Lord do do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me and Naomi said that the Bible says that when Naomi realized that she was that Ruth was steadfastly minded then she didn't bother trying to hinder her anymore yes you know when someone has got that seed of God in them I tell you they're steadfastly minded for the things of God you can't shake them off nothing they just they're so fixated on it all the church could fall apart they could suffer all sorts of ridicule everyone make fun of them everyone leave them they're steadfastly minded they'll carry on regardless you know it's like the seed that just it it finds its way out it'll come to life that's the way that we are and now this is just Ruth natural she hadn't had a there was not she didn't know anything about the land there was nothing like that it was just Ruth and the natural this worthy Ruth but she said I want to go with you so now they turn up in this promised land they they make this journey there and I wondered how I was going to run this type through because it you know not all types sort of don't always work all the way through every story or you know they start at a certain point and they finished a certain point you can't really run them through there but you know when they got back there theyi said call me uh call me not Naomi which means Pleasant don't call call me Pleasant call me Mara which means bitter you know for the almighty ha dealt very bitterly with me you know I often think and that respect you know there were you think about you've got your theophany K Shantel everyone's got this theophany there there was a point in your life where you were so distant from your theophany was in Heavenly places and you were in the virtually in the pits of hell you know eventually we want to come together but you know Naomi had to make it all the way down to This Strange Land and and you know and endure this journey with you know just to bring that just to bring that that so that Ruth would come back when I was in Germany we went across the road and the light was red where it said walk and I looked left and looked right look this way again there were no cars so you know we walk and then the the brother that was with me the Pastor said I no no no we we wait for the light to go green the walk light he said you know in Germany we ever saying he said you know your theophany will stay on this side where you walk across we were driving to church the other day and one of the brothers won't mention who it was shot past us at about 120 km and I had all the boys in the car and I said oh look boys wave out to brother that's Brother s so on his way to church going 120 K you know maybe his he got there before his [Laughter] theophany but there was a point in time where you know it seems at at ends you know where where we should be and where we are now you can picture Ruth now as she's coming into this land she turns up as a nobody she's got nothing she she doesn't belong in the land she's not from there she's got no family apart from naom me but she's a nobody when she turns up she's got nothing to offer she's got she's of no benefit to anybody there no benefit and so she says to Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose eyes in whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter so she just went out looking for Grace because she realized I'm just totally unworthy I'm unworthy and all I'm going to be doing is probably going out there getting in somebody's way picking up wheat and whatever these people are harvesting barley it was picking up barley after the rapers I'm more than likely going to get in the way I'm of no value to them but I'm just going to head down the anyway and hopefully some of them will be nice to me and I'll be able to get a wee bit of uh corn or barley that's she's saying in herself I'm just totally unworthy I'm just Ruth the moabitas from Moab I'm here this is not my land I'm I'm unworthy to even do this but I'm just going to go and try and glean a bit of corn a bit of wheat a bit of barley and that's often the way that we come to God we say Lord I'm Just So Unworthy and so she went there and she started to glean this is Ruth the moabit is Ruth from the world Ruth this unworthy one and Ruth is gleaning in the field I put the pictures on for the children I wasn't going to have pictures but I specifically put them on for the children I was just going to preach I like nice pictures too I can't stand modern art abstract art one day there was a person that had a they had a rubbish bag as a piece of art and they put it as an exhibition and at at night the cleaner came in and threw it away and then the next morning the man says oh where's my piece of art and they realized it's in the bin he said they said I'll just go get it out of the bin he said no I have to make a new one that's too damaged [Music] this is a pathetic world we live in now minds of insane you that man needs to be told you're insane think normally get the word of God in you and think normally this is nonsense you know we need to stand up say this is nonsense that's what the Lord would say you know he was a he was a man of he didn't suffer fools gladly and he called nonsense nonsense you know we become so PC we end up putting up with stuff like that to our detriment now Ruth after a while Boaz a man called Boaz turns up to the field he looks around and he sees he sees a woman gleaning in the field and he asks his servant he said who is that woman and the servant says oh that's Ruth the moabitas that's that's her from Moab not part of us just from Moab out of the country of Moab and Boaz go goes over begins to talk to her and he says he said look I've heard about you I kind of like you you he said don't you know today when you're gleaning just stay in my field just glean here don't don't go and glean in other fields just just glean in my field stay here and you know maybe at lunchtime come and get something to eat and then come back out and when it's dinner come and get some food and then you can you can carry on Ruth went out looking for Grace I need Grace Just give me Grace and here comes this man and gives her grace because she felt like I'm So Unworthy now now what is she to Boaz really Boaz had handmaids he had workers he had Fields he had all the stuff what value was she to Boaz nothing let's be honest she brought no value to the table to no value to the relationship she was just coming there gleaning if he had told her to leave or stay it would have meant it would have been would have meant nothing to him either way it wouldn't have affected his life either way she brought nothing to the table she was going completely unworthy and she was and so are we when we come to Christ lot of just unworthy right amen and then it says then it says she fell on her face she bowed her she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger Lord I I I don't belong in this this is not for me you've just been you've been so good to give me Grace amen you've just given me Grace and I don't I don't deserve it I don't I'm just a stranger in this land but the thing about it was she wasn't she just had to have a revelation from a theophany later on that you're not actually a stranger in this land This Is Your Land but at that point she was just looking for Grace Lord just be merciful to me you know this is a part of our journey but we can't stay here we can't stay in this spot because there was more for her to have than just a bit of barley a bit of corn a bit of food in here you know many many Christians just settle for that settle for these good things of God without actually coming into a union with the King himself see there was a union to be had but but but she would never have thought in wildest dreams I'm going to have there'll be in Union with that man she never thought that she just thought wow he's given me Grace to give me all these good things many many Believers just stay here not you you know and she said why and boas said unto her it has been fully shown me all that thou Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and a come unto a people which thou knewest not here too for so he's kind of saying look way back when you made that choice and you decided you're going to come and and go with Naomi and you just you had to push through a bit of that persecution and you just had to push through I I liked that that's why I had Grace on you so it was it was purposeful Grace he he he actually heard about her through other people I've heard about you and I I like what you've done the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel unto under whose wings Thou Art come to trust now that could have been the end of her relationship with Boaz thank you thank you look I'll be head to glean this year then I'll come next year I'll come the year after come the year after I'll just do my little thing because I'm Just So Unworthy I'm just I'm not worthy of any of this but thank you every year thank you thank you which is okay but that's not where we uh should be there's a point where we come into more than that and we realize who we are and who he is and more ways than just throwing out some coin born all right and this is where I want to bring this now to a revelation that Ruth had you could say from a theophany because Ruth came back and told Naomi you you won't believe this I was out in this such and such a field and look at all this look at all this Grace I was shine look at all this look at all this corn look at all this wheat look look at all that I've got and now remember this is a theophany this this is Naomi from that land she said whose field were you in and Naomi said Ruth said to Naomi uh the man that owns the field his name was um Boaz now Naomi gave Ruth the Revelation she said to her blessed be he of the Lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and Naomi said unto her this man is near of kin to us one of our next Kinsmen she didn't say oh bless the Lord he's near of kin to me she got a deeper Revelation this man is near of kin to you you're not just Ruth the maritus yeah come on now amen that's right Ruth the nobody Ruth the Unworthy one you are near kin to this man Boaz you you you're actually you're somebody this is your inheritance you you don't need to come and say I'm a stranger in the land I don't deserve any of this actually you do deserve this amen that man is your near kin see that's where we need to come to when we get that Revelation actually hold on I'm a part of this even though I may have come out of the world and come this way I'm from that land thank you Lord Jesus I'm a part of that and this great Redeemer actually dare I say it has a responsibility if I can put it that way as a kinsman redeemer to who to me yes sir right I'm not just a stranger I'm part of this promise I've got inheritance here that was a long way different thinking than just Ruth The Stranger Ruth the Unworthy one now she's thinking hold on a minute yeah am I worthy cuz remember it was through that word that she had heard that was her connection through this the the daughter uh the son of Naomi that was her connection she heard that word and she was she was connected through that but that word wasn't the actual thing itself that first husband that wasn't the actual thing itself she had to find The Giver of that word the the the voice behind that voice see but it was through that that she was connected that's why Naomi said it's our inheritance you seejah yes amen amen you see it's it's now it's your inheritance not just Naomi said it's not just mine but it's yours yes thank you Lord that's why when the next meeting that she has with Boaz is not be gracious unto me give me some corn give me some wheat I'm just a I'm just a sinner I'm Ruth from Moab now I don't want to say that we come to God like ah you you owe me but you see it's balanced because we we have to at some point realize who we are amen because then we can walk into the promises Satan always chose to say no it's not for you you're just Ruth the maitus it's not for you it's like no hang on hang on hang on all right no no I've got an inheritance I'm actually from here I've got an inheritance from this even though it feels like sometimes I'm not I'm So Unworthy but yet I am worthy I'm not going to be robbed of these blessings I'm not going to be robbed of these promises because my feelings tell me I'm not worthy I am worthy Lord so she goes to Boz and Boaz is laying down in the in the threshing floor and then he wakes up and he sees a woman lying at his feet and he's startled and he says who are you he said who are you now she doesn't answer and say I'm Ruth the moabitas because she's not Ruth the moabitas she says I'm Ruth thine handmaid Glory moreover she says spread your skirt over me for thou art a near Kinsman to me Hallelujah you're a Kinsman to me I belong to you I'm part of this promise there's a connection between you and me you're a near Kin I'm not Ruth the maritus I'm actually a kin to you to the great Redeemer I'm worthy spread your skirt over me I'm worthy because I'm part of this promise not because I'm anything but I actually I am this I am I'm a Son of God I'm the bride of Christ I'm worthy Hallelujah spread your spirit over me you're a near kin to me that's a lot different than having me some corn hand me some corn that's I want to come into a union with you redeem me raise up a seed raise up the Eternal seed in me Boaz what a Bo say I will amall he said I will amen what you've asked me to do I'll do it GL you are right you're correct you are my king you're correct you all are my king Hallelujah you're correct I have a responsibility to redeem you you're correct you are worthy you're worth redeeming you're part of me am see and but there was one issue there was one issue one last issue that they had to conquer was that there was another man that was near a king than he was than Boaz brother R types this man as the as the devil you know and in a way when you run it through like this you know he he can be so the custom was that boas had to go to the gate in the morning and and wait for this man to come and he has to stop him and say how want I have a talk with you now he started off talking about Naomi he said there's a woman Naomi that emik emik um our our brother married and he passed away and there's no one to um raise up seed on her inheritance so I want I I want to redeem Naomi that's what he first said he didn't say Ruth he said I want I want to redeem Naomi and Satan not without thinking about it says and then he and then sorry Boaz said to her to him to this other man uh but it's up to you if you want if you want to redeem the land and redeem them then you can and him without thinking said I'll take it I'll do it I'll do it but then Boaz Bo said hold on hold on hold on I didn't do that on purpose but I just said that no there's no CB in here but he did say hold on hold on the day you redeem Naomi you must redeem Ruth the day you redeem Naomi you must and what did he call her he said you must redeem Ruth the maitus you must redeem her you must you must be able to redeem her from that land you must have the power within you to redeem this body not just that body this body you must actually do you have the purchasing power in you to redeem this body this flesh this world this this Fallen man this can you redeem her yeah you can redeem Naomi but can you redeem Ruth do you have the power in you to redeem Ruth can you do it and he looked at his bank account he said I cannot do it I do not have the purchasing power to redeem Ruth oh boy I cannot do itj I forfeit it see God came down as a man to redeem Ruth the moabitas to bring her in Union with her theophany to make one complete being not just not just up there but he came here to redeem truth to redeem us to make everyone worthy and the the other man said I cannot do it I cannot redeem them he said okay then I redeem the whole lot all that was emc's all that was his is now mine and I'm going to raise up a seed on their inheritance which is going to be the promised son Hallelujah and that's where David came from that's right all that the father has given me will come and you know when I was was just thinking about this you know I I I I'm just enclosing now I was I was thinking so much about my own Journey how that you know I've been I've been in these different places in my mind where even in even you hear the word but even in your in your mind you still think Lord I'm So Unworthy I'm just unworthy but you know as you go on and as you get closer to your theophany and as the word is revealed to you more you start to realize yes I know I'm unworthy I've never disputed that but you start to get shine actually but actually I'm a part of this promise he is my redeemer there's there's I'm worthy of redemption I'm worthy to dwell in his courts I'm worthy to sit by his side not because of what I've done but because of who I am I'm this that's I'm a part of that Kingdom yeah I was born into it generational wealth Glory that's what we've got and you know it's we we in our meekness try not to do that but it's important that we actually by faith recognize who we are so that we can move forward into the promises of God and recognize God redeemed Christ redeemed all of us and he redeemed us because we were worthy because we were next ofin to him that's why he redeemed us and don't let Satan ever tell you you're not part of this this is not your thing like Ruth the maritus oh I'm not part of it no I'm just a stranger in the land you're not strangers you're not strangers in this land this is your land this word of God Is Your Land you're not strangers you're you're citizens of this land amen this is where you belong Hallelujah in this land amen that was that was the that was a thought that I had on my heart this evening to to Shar amen um Hallelujah I want you to go away and think about it and always remember who you are your sons and daughters of God don't don't let Satan tell you anything less if you start to get a bit prideful about it then just think to yourself I'm just an unworthy servant I'm an because you're still unworthy Ruth from Moab but you know you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so depending on how you feel on the day you sort of but don't let the devil rob you cuz you know he'll he'll try and Rob you from the his promises because if you think oh this is not mine oh it's them but it's not me you have an inheritance in this land we all do amen Lord amen let's um let's stand tonight and
