[46:38] us from every unclean Spirit Lord
[46:40] anything that's not of you Lord in our

[46:43] and cast out in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:45] Lord you can have free reign Lord we
[46:48] surrender the service into your hands
[46:49] now for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[46:51] name amen amen you may have your seats
[46:55] uh this morning so I want to talk about
[46:58] um I want to talk about
[47:00] selfishness today now this may seem like
[47:04] quite a Quantum Leap to go from the
[47:05] heart of the devil down into man but we
[47:08] know that all these things come from the
[47:10] devil we know that you know it was
[47:12] really selfish ambition that made him
[47:14] rise up above what God made him to be
[47:16] when he came to a place when he realized
[47:18] he was the greatest one where he was the
[47:20] best one that was ever made and you know
[47:23] brother Brown would say he was God's
[47:24] right-hand man because he was the
[47:26] anointed cherub that covereth and you
[47:28] know he actually uh controlled the
[47:29] access to God of other angels and you
[47:32] know but there came a thought in his
[47:33] mind one day that that he could do a
[47:35] better job than God and he knew what you
[47:37] know but it really came because his
[47:40] whole ambition was here like I will be
[47:42] like the most high so I don't know how
[47:44] it initially would have started but it
[47:46] would have been like how how Spirits get
[47:48] among people you know someone starts
[47:50] with an idea which is inspired from an
[47:52] evil spirit and and then they begin to
[47:54] talk to their friends talk to their
[47:55] family create a bit of an influence and
[47:57] you know next thing you know our their
[47:59] true intention comes out you know so
[48:01] amazed when you think about you know
[48:02] there's a saying when when you cross the
[48:05] Rubicon and and that's saying I know if
[48:07] you've heard of it is when Julius Caesar
[48:09] would would cross he had to make a
[48:11] decision because no no armies no no
[48:13] Legions who cross the river called the
[48:15] Rubicon down towards Rome and once he
[48:18] crossed that point there was a point of
[48:19] no return where he had to go and take
[48:21] the throne and so he made that decision
[48:23] to cross the Rubicon and and we know
[48:25] Vladimir Putin made that decision when
[48:26] he invaded Ukraine he went past the
[48:28] point of no return Hitler did the same
[48:30] thing and many men have done that same
[48:31] thing as well and and the devil we know
[48:34] it all started in his heart where where
[48:36] no doubt here sit down with other angels
[48:38] that our fellowship talk about God or
[48:40] talk about different things and and and
[48:42] and his whole motive was was a selfish
[48:45] ambition to be like the most high but in
[48:47] order to do that he had to make the
[48:49] other Angels unhappy with their lot with
[48:51] what God had made them to be just like
[48:53] how you know Cora and Nathan there in
[48:55] the wilderness he made the people of
[48:56] Israel unhappy with the leadership of
[48:58] Moses is different things you know so it
[49:00] always happens down Through the Ages
[49:01] where it's selfish ambition causes
[49:04] people to come to a place that's really
[49:06] they should ever be in and and that and
[49:08] that we know uh comes from the enemy
[49:10] right any any negative attribute like
[49:13] selfishness Pride Envy malice Strife all
[49:15] those things came from Satan right and
[49:17] we have to come to a place where like
[49:19] the Lord Jesus said I have no pardon him
[49:21] and he has no pardon me so any part of
[49:23] his character is not mine I'm not
[49:25] signing up for it I don't want nothing I
[49:27] don't want to speak of it I don't want a
[49:28] shadow of it I don't want to trace I
[49:30] don't want nothing that that he is see
[49:32] but the thing is because of man and and
[49:35] and the fall and the garden where
[49:37] unfortunately we have received a fallen
[49:40] character from which actually came from
[49:42] the devil because you know we've got to
[49:44] come to a point and realize we need a
[49:45] new birth to change our nature amen that
[49:48] all that he is the works of the flesh
[49:49] even don't have dominion in our life
[49:51] anymore because we realize when the Holy
[49:53] Ghost truly comes into a person he
[49:55] changes their nature right what you once
[49:57] were I trust you can say and it's not
[49:59] because you quit smoking quit drinking
[50:01] just start coming to church that's not
[50:03] even it it's when he changes your
[50:05] desires your Natures that you will agree
[50:07] with every word of God Amen that you'll
[50:09] say Amen to every word you can't help it
[50:11] because the one who wrote the word is
[50:12] now on you amen but you see now remember
[50:16] Satan's ambition was to be like the most
[50:19] high so he wanted to be worship now it's
[50:21] amazing when you can see this trait fall
[50:23] in among human beings now we understand
[50:26] that when we talk about here for we're
[50:28] jealous for jealousy and selfish
[50:30] ambition exist there'll be disorder and
[50:33] every vile practice now many times we
[50:35] think of all practices maybe of people
[50:37] who dress like the world look like the
[50:39] world talk like the world but we know
[50:41] that Satan did not changes outward
[50:42] appearance you know of of of of dressing
[50:45] right acting right you know his outward
[50:47] manifestation didn't change he looked
[50:49] like a believer
[50:51] right he looked like a Believer so it
[50:53] was what was in his heart was coming out
[50:55] and that's what destroyed you know
[50:57] brought brought all the destruction that
[50:59] we know today so people can dress the
[51:01] part they can act the part they can look
[51:03] like they're walking a Holiness walk but
[51:05] they can be full of a selfish ambition
[51:07] and what does it do it brings in every
[51:11] vile practice and disorder all my and
[51:14] and so so what this produces is actually
[51:16] a disorder is what does that disorder
[51:19] against the word of God where they no
[51:21] longer walk at Harmony with God okay I'm
[51:23] sorry this is not a shouting service
[51:24] okay this is just where we are okay but
[51:26] we've got to say Lord examine us one put
[51:30] us on your sacrifice sacrifice your
[51:32] altar Lord I don't want to be any
[51:34] selfish kind of believer who thinks
[51:35] they're better than someone else and
[51:37] have a bit of a selfish ambition I don't
[51:39] want nothing of that in me I want to be
[51:41] burned out Lord that but that I made in
[51:43] your image see anything is of the devil
[51:45] is opposite or perverted
[51:47] to what God has made right so we don't
[51:50] want every vile practice where there's
[51:52] fussing and fighting and slander and
[51:54] gossip and hatred and Malice and strife
[51:56] and Division and Cults and Clans and
[51:58] clicks and trouble and we don't want any
[52:00] of those things I mean we want a real
[52:02] Unity
[52:03] I mean where where God feels welcome you
[52:06] know I was praying I was praying last
[52:08] night he said Lord may you just feel so
[52:10] welcome
[52:11] remember he he was invited to Simon the
[52:13] Pharisees house he was not felt welcome
[52:15] then but he went anyway because wherever
[52:18] he's invited he goes right but I said
[52:21] Lord me me just feel the most welcome
[52:23] that that that we are known as a people
[52:26] and as individuals and the families that
[52:28] that what we are known by is is in your
[52:31] mind we are the most welcoming the most
[52:35] loving of your presence we we put out
[52:37] the red carpet then the red carpet then
[52:39] the red carpet for you you're so welcome
[52:41] in our lives you never feel embarrassed
[52:43] you never feel you know uneasy you know
[52:46] God feels uneasy sometimes do you think
[52:48] Jesus went into Simon the Pharisees
[52:50] house and was all relaxed no I would
[52:53] have felt tense being in that kind of
[52:54] atmosphere he knew the very motive in
[52:56] Simon's heart than a vitamin there in
[52:58] the first place see so so I was praying
[53:00] Lord we don't want to be like that
[53:01] change our hearts Lord that that when
[53:04] you think of a man I love to spend time
[53:06] with my people then I love to spend time
[53:08] with that family I love spend time with
[53:10] that brother yo yo my son and my
[53:11] daughter I just love their because they
[53:13] love me so much they welcome me so much
[53:15] but you see the enemy wants to bring in
[53:18] a a a disorder and a vile practice where
[53:20] God says well they invited me so I'll
[53:22] turn up but I don't really want to go
[53:24] oh Lord help us amen you see now we I
[53:30] think I got everyone's attention just
[53:31] about now that's good amen but you see
[53:34] uh let's just find the see we live in an
[53:37] age
[53:38] this is our age there's no also than the
[53:41] last days perilous times shall come men
[53:44] shall be lovers of their own selves it's
[53:46] interesting that that is first first
[53:47] listed when God inspires the Apostle
[53:50] Paul to write this down would it be
[53:52] Covetous POTUS boasters proud
[53:54] Blasphemous disobedient to parents
[53:56] unthankful Unholy without natural
[53:58] affections truce Breakers false accusers
[54:00] and continent Fierce despise of those
[54:03] that are good traitors handy high-minded
[54:06] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[54:09] God so these people that that Paul is
[54:11] writing about he's not just talking
[54:12] about people who are atheists or you
[54:14] know got nothing to do with God don't
[54:15] care he's talking about Christian people
[54:17] I mean where where where they men shall
[54:21] be they'll love themselves more lovers
[54:24] of their own selves right lovers of
[54:26] pleasure more than lovers of God so it
[54:29] doesn't say they don't profess to love
[54:30] God doesn't profess that it doesn't say
[54:33] that they don't believe in God but
[54:35] they're selfish they love themselves
[54:37] more than they I love the Lord I pray
[54:40] that we're the opposite of this
[54:41] scripture
[54:42] I pray this is my life you know you know
[54:45] the opposite of this whatever the
[54:46] opposite of the devil is that's me
[54:48] because that's the law that's the word
[54:50] that's what we want to be
[54:51] I mean so so we don't want to fall into
[54:54] this category but we know that this
[54:55] anointing is upon the Earth
[54:57] you know it's all about the time of self
[54:59] and me and my and what I'm doing and all
[55:02] these things and you know we don't need
[55:04] to go into social media this selfie all
[55:06] those things it's all about me me me I I
[55:09] what about me but and and it's amazing
[55:12] how people have that at you being
[55:13] they're so unhappy
[55:15] yeah this is such an unhappy age but
[55:17] it's all about me
[55:18] see it's not about how it used to be you
[55:20] know just get up do your work come on do
[55:22] this think about this other person what
[55:23] about this guy you know it's all changed
[55:26] but people are less happy now
[55:27] with this kind of mentality than they
[55:30] were a generation at least ago
[55:33] but we don't want to get caught up in
[55:35] the same trap where it's all about
[55:37] selfishness
[55:40] oh my now
[55:41] I gotta find that as I said my notes are
[55:44] never ever in order but you see now
[55:46] we need to come to a place you said I
[55:49] mean always go to this a bit more see
[55:52] and the Lord would speak about in this
[55:53] day there should be signs in the sun and
[55:55] the moon and the stars and upon the
[55:57] Earth the stress of nations with
[55:58] perplexity and the season waves roaring
[56:01] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[56:03] for looking after those things which are
[56:04] coming on the earth for the powers of
[56:06] Heaven shall be shaken nice but this is
[56:08] the spirit of the age this one but
[56:10] that's not our portion just like to be a
[56:12] lover of your own self love is a
[56:14] pleasure more than lovers of God these
[56:16] things are here we can't escape it
[56:19] we're not called to live in a monastery
[56:21] somewhere in the bush somewhere and just
[56:22] you and your family and you know no
[56:24] we're we're in the world but we're not
[56:26] of the world Okay so we've got to
[56:28] realize these things are here but we
[56:30] need to get into the spirit of the word
[56:31] to overcome these things see it's so
[56:35] important that we that we don't just go
[56:37] through the motions of Christianity but
[56:38] we get into the Holy Ghost himself and
[56:41] then walk with him amen see it's so
[56:44] important that we get into the spirit
[56:45] first see if we're going to live as
[56:48] Christians brother but I'm saying we
[56:49] have to be in his Spirit John was not
[56:52] talking about being in his own Spirit
[56:53] when he said I was in the spirit on the
[56:54] Lord's Day that would not have brought
[56:56] these visions that had to be the spirit
[56:58] of God it had to be the spirit of God
[57:00] with us too or all our efforts are in
[57:02] vain Paul said I'll pray in the spirit
[57:05] I'll sing in the spirit I'll live in the
[57:06] spirit if there's if there is anything
[57:09] good that will come to me it has to be
[57:10] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[57:12] word and made manifest by the results it
[57:15] bears as surely as John needed to be in
[57:17] the spirit to receive these tremendous
[57:19] Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to
[57:21] be in the spirit to understand the
[57:22] revelations that God has given to us to
[57:24] live by his word for it is the same
[57:27] spirit amen said look at it this way all
[57:30] too many people read the Bible where it
[57:31] says in Acts 2 38 repent to be baptized
[57:34] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[57:35] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[57:38] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[57:39] and just pass right on they don't see it
[57:42] if they saw it by getting in the spirit
[57:44] they would know that if they want to
[57:46] receive the Holy Spirit they need to
[57:48] repent and be baptized in the name of
[57:49] the Lord Jesus and then God would be
[57:51] Duty bound to fulfill his word by
[57:53] filling them with the Holy Ghost they
[57:55] never get in his Spirit or it would
[57:58] happen to them exactly as the word says
[58:00] pray to God for a revelation by his
[58:02] spirit that is the first step get in the
[58:05] spirit see when we get in the spirit
[58:07] then all of all of the things in our
[58:09] life that are not of God become revealed
[58:11] writers like when you're walking in
[58:13] darkness you shine a bright light you
[58:15] see where all the bugs are the Shadows
[58:16] are and you see everything for what it
[58:18] is now who remembers being young and
[58:20] there's some big Shadow comes at night
[58:22] time across the wall and it seems so
[58:23] terrifying but then as soon as you you
[58:26] know you call mum or dad and they turn
[58:28] on the light you say oh that's just some
[58:30] I don't know some some toy on the ground
[58:32] projecting that shadow it's really
[58:33] nothing you see so we need a light to
[58:36] shine to show us really what these
[58:38] things are and so hey that's actually
[58:39] doesn't belong to me well I think this
[58:42] thing is it's not mine and it can really
[58:44] reveal what it is amen so
[58:47] we need to get in the spirit first
[58:49] it is absolutely important you see now
[58:52] brother bear makes a statement there is
[58:53] nothing as such prevailing power as the
[58:56] revelation of the word amen faith is a
[58:58] revelation it gives you power over the
[59:00] enemy the world and yourself amen so
[59:03] that's why it's so important Lord
[59:05] give me Revelation of you reveal
[59:07] yourself to me in your word Lord I don't
[59:09] want to approach your word like a
[59:11] textbook Lord I want every relationship
[59:12] with you and your word that you can
[59:14] reveal yourself to me amen because as he
[59:16] reveals himself to you then he becomes
[59:18] begins to form character in you that's
[59:20] manifested in Trials amen you see it's
[59:23] so important that we that we don't ever
[59:26] get selfish in our walk with God see
[59:28] this world is a selfish world but we
[59:31] aren't called to live as a selfish
[59:33] people now what is uh the meaning of a
[59:36] selfish person this is from Miriam
[59:37] Webster the dictionary it says what is
[59:40] uh the meaning of a selfish person it's
[59:42] concerned expressly or exclusively with
[59:45] oneself seeking or concentrating on
[59:48] one's own Advantage what was Satan doing
[59:51] concentrating on his own Advantage I'm
[59:53] going to get these angels to follow me
[59:55] and they're going to worship me I want
[59:56] to be like the most high it's your
[59:58] selfish ambition in his heart that
[1:00:00] caused this chaos that we live in right
[1:00:02] now
[1:00:03] amen see concerning one's own Advantage
[1:00:06] pleasure or or well-being without regard
[1:00:08] for others arising with concern with
[1:00:12] one's own welfare or advantage and
[1:00:14] disregard of others it's a selfish act
[1:00:16] so selfishness is not about the other
[1:00:19] person it's about you I mean and that's
[1:00:21] what the devil's interested and he
[1:00:23] doesn't actually care about those who
[1:00:24] serve him doesn't care about the angels
[1:00:25] that followed him they just Cannon
[1:00:27] fighter in his books he's not even
[1:00:28] interested in their welfare he just
[1:00:30] wants to ascend to where he wants to be
[1:00:31] amen but God is the opposite of that
[1:00:33] amen you are the focus of his being
[1:00:36] right now you are actually his purpose
[1:00:38] right now is you and your welfare and
[1:00:41] you being gathered to him your
[1:00:42] Redemption and remember when when you
[1:00:45] when he was on the cross you were on his
[1:00:47] mind remember he didn't just die there
[1:00:48] haphazardly saying well someone will
[1:00:50] feel sorry for me one day and be a
[1:00:51] Christian no he knew you and he knew you
[1:00:54] needed Redemption that's why he put your
[1:00:56] own life above himself he was not
[1:00:58] selfish at all amen he put his own needs
[1:01:01] secondary to yours
[1:01:03] Hallelujah that's how our God works amen
[1:01:06] amen and you take any True Believer down
[1:01:09] Through the Ages they put themselves
[1:01:11] second and they put God's needs in the
[1:01:13] and and God's people's needs above their
[1:01:16] own
[1:01:17] amen because remember we've got to be
[1:01:19] careful what is our ambition to be a
[1:01:21] Christian
[1:01:22] is it too is it to have an influence
[1:01:24] over a group of people is it to be a
[1:01:26] celebrity in a little kind of part of
[1:01:29] society what is our ambition
[1:01:31] when when when I stand here or someone
[1:01:34] preaches or someone plays an instrument
[1:01:36] or sings what's the ambition behind it
[1:01:38] is the ambition to say look at me and
[1:01:40] look how good I am see we're not here to
[1:01:43] applaud gifts we're here to praise God
[1:01:45] right so so what are we what's our
[1:01:47] ambition I want to be noticed well
[1:01:49] that's selfish we want him to be known
[1:01:52] remember a mature grain boughs like this
[1:01:55] yeah a mature one is up like this it's
[1:01:58] saying look at me here I am I've done
[1:02:00] this and God told me to do this and all
[1:02:01] it's all about me right by the mature
[1:02:03] one bows in the presence of the Sun and
[1:02:06] when you see someone or something bowing
[1:02:07] you're like what is that what is that
[1:02:09] personal thing bowing to and you look at
[1:02:11] the thing you look at the object it's
[1:02:12] bowing to right so it should be the same
[1:02:14] thing with us like what is what is our
[1:02:16] ambition amen if our ambition is to see
[1:02:19] him live you can't be selfish right but
[1:02:21] if you're ambition is to be look at me
[1:02:23] and who I am and what I can do
[1:02:25] I think you got a trait you need to get
[1:02:27] rid of
[1:02:28] because it was in heaven and not in God
[1:02:29] now it's upon the Earth in human beings
[1:02:32] and so you know we've got to be very
[1:02:35] very careful what's our motive and
[1:02:36] objective
[1:02:38] is it to be a blessing or just to be
[1:02:40] blessed by Praise
[1:02:41] you know what is the yeah because it can
[1:02:43] look the same
[1:02:45] like I could stand here and you know try
[1:02:47] and point everything to me the
[1:02:49] conclusion of my sermon is I'm awesome
[1:02:51] you know I could do that right
[1:02:54] and then but then you just preach
[1:02:57] a different way a proper way and it's
[1:02:58] God's awesome
[1:03:00] you know it could be My Mind Is Awesome
[1:03:02] look what I've put together look at all
[1:03:03] this yeah but then it could be the same
[1:03:05] notes and look God is awesome because he
[1:03:07] gave it and it's him who's the center of
[1:03:08] it it can look the same but the actually
[1:03:10] the motive is very different see so
[1:03:13] we're going to be very careful in our
[1:03:14] Christian walk like even we compare
[1:03:16] families with families we shouldn't do
[1:03:17] that
[1:03:19] well my lifestyle's been in that my yeah
[1:03:21] but but what is the reason of that
[1:03:23] comparison to make you look better
[1:03:26] where did that come from
[1:03:28] that's not out of the Bible in terms of
[1:03:29] God that's not Christianity no that's
[1:03:31] that's Antichrist
[1:03:33] see it can appear so close
[1:03:36] this is the age where everything's so
[1:03:38] gray it's all mixed like this but God is
[1:03:41] black and white there's truth in this
[1:03:43] era but the devil wants to try and push
[1:03:45] into the truth and take most of the
[1:03:47] truth and make it error we needed a
[1:03:48] Discerning spirit
[1:03:50] I mean that we can look Beyond these
[1:03:52] things and say no I'm concentrating on
[1:03:54] his Advantage I'm just using those words
[1:03:56] I want him to live amen I want the Lord
[1:03:58] to be glorified
[1:03:59] say to be condescending is selfish in
[1:04:02] itself
[1:04:03] to be condescending uh towards people
[1:04:06] patronizing giving a superiority that is
[1:04:09] selfishness because you're contrasting
[1:04:11] comparing yourself to someone else and
[1:04:12] lifting yourself up and putting that
[1:04:14] person down see sideways remarks about
[1:04:17] other people and especially that's Satan
[1:04:20] we're not here to tear each other down
[1:04:22] we don't want to be see a selfish a
[1:04:25] selfish believer
[1:04:28] there's like the ambulance at the bottom
[1:04:29] of the cliff
[1:04:31] now that's uh that's not a that's just
[1:04:33] imposed there that's the Cliffs of Dover
[1:04:34] I think um you know England but anyway a
[1:04:37] selfish believer wants someone to fall
[1:04:39] and they actually trying to push them
[1:04:41] over the cliff by comments and attitudes
[1:04:44] that's selfish because they want to look
[1:04:45] better than them and then they fall and
[1:04:47] they say look I told you so yeah I had a
[1:04:50] feeling you know the Lord told me this
[1:04:52] would happen well if that was true why
[1:04:56] are you the ambulance at the bottom of
[1:04:57] the cliff you should be at the top of
[1:04:59] the top of the cliff stopping the person
[1:05:01] in love see look Jeremiah got a vision
[1:05:04] that the Babylonians gonna come and
[1:05:05] destroy Israel and thinks he didn't sit
[1:05:08] there when it happened said I told you
[1:05:09] so he gave his life saying turn from
[1:05:11] your wickedness Israel these guys are
[1:05:14] going to come and destroy us he actually
[1:05:15] had a burden of genuine care why because
[1:05:18] he wasn't the ambulance at the bottom of
[1:05:19] the cliff so what I mean by the
[1:05:21] ambulance at the bottom of the cliff now
[1:05:22] is when someone goes out into the world
[1:05:24] and then oh now we need to pray for them
[1:05:26] now we need to reach out to them well
[1:05:28] why didn't you reach out to them when
[1:05:29] they're walking up the top of the cliff
[1:05:31] and teetering and are they going to give
[1:05:33] their lives to Lord or not or you know
[1:05:35] we should be at the top of the cliff
[1:05:38] if you really cared for CeCe see it
[1:05:41] appears see it appears good when you say
[1:05:43] oh we need to pray for them because
[1:05:44] they're struggling they're in those
[1:05:45] troubles and they've gone to the world
[1:05:46] now that's just an ambulance at the
[1:05:48] bottom of the cliff it looks good but
[1:05:50] it's actually not right we should be at
[1:05:52] the top of the cliff
[1:05:54] creating an atmosphere and being warm
[1:05:57] and caring and loving creating a
[1:05:59] creating an environment that we can walk
[1:06:01] through these doors and say well at
[1:06:02] least I can relax in this place at least
[1:06:04] I can let off the pressure I don't need
[1:06:06] to be all tense and worry about people
[1:06:07] say about me but I can actually let off
[1:06:09] the pressure just worship God no matter
[1:06:12] what I'm going through the Troubles of
[1:06:13] my life the questions I have I can
[1:06:15] actually relax in this place
[1:06:18] praise God is that what you want that's
[1:06:20] what you want in your home don't you you
[1:06:22] can be facing hell day after they have
[1:06:24] trouble at school trouble at Job
[1:06:25] whatever but at least you have a
[1:06:27] sanctuary of your home right and that's
[1:06:29] where it should be and that's the reason
[1:06:31] you want to go home is like man I can
[1:06:33] just put my feet up you know I can relax
[1:06:35] sure you may be busy lots of kids all
[1:06:37] these things but you can actually just
[1:06:38] relax there
[1:06:40] don't we want Church to be the same way
[1:06:42] and actual an actual place where people
[1:06:46] can let off the pressure
[1:06:48] doesn't matter what they're going
[1:06:49] through you say well I'm struggling but
[1:06:50] just
[1:06:51] that's fine in terms of just come
[1:06:54] right we're not here to throw anyone off
[1:06:56] the cliff
[1:06:57] with discernment
[1:06:59] no a lot of it's just a selfish critical
[1:07:01] nature
[1:07:03] see we we never want to come to a place
[1:07:06] where all we care about is people
[1:07:08] leaving in terms of well I knew they'd
[1:07:09] leave
[1:07:11] where was the heart to go after that
[1:07:13] person where was the heart to be their
[1:07:15] friend and you know have it have a bit
[1:07:17] of an influence you know a real genuine
[1:07:19] friendship because you care about them
[1:07:22] right you don't want to appear some
[1:07:24] people they they they pick their friends
[1:07:26] based on because they're better than
[1:07:27] that person maybe they're smarter maybe
[1:07:30] they're richer maybe that's not real
[1:07:31] friendship that's a selfish ambition
[1:07:34] just to say well I'm better than these
[1:07:35] people around me we should never be like
[1:07:37] that who's with me today
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:41] see
[1:07:43] we live in this perilous time
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:47] there's a there's a syndrome that goes
[1:07:49] around in this day and age called the
[1:07:51] elder brother syndrome
[1:07:52] it's a real bad syndrome
[1:07:55] it's deadly to the one carrying it it
[1:07:59] can look so good it can appear so right
[1:08:01] but yet it's a terrible thing it doesn't
[1:08:03] break out in scabs doesn't break out in
[1:08:05] big growths you know but but it looks so
[1:08:08] bad man I love looking for pictures
[1:08:10] though I just have a good time but you
[1:08:12] see
[1:08:13] here's the elder brother so so you see
[1:08:15] the one outside there's a protocol Sons
[1:08:18] come home everyone's rejoicing
[1:08:20] everyone's happy you know the father's
[1:08:22] happy
[1:08:23] everyone's happy apart from the this guy
[1:08:26] it's like what's wrong with you you
[1:08:28] should be rejoicing here's your brother
[1:08:30] he's come home he was dead you know he's
[1:08:33] dead now he's alive he was in sin he did
[1:08:35] all these things you know you remember
[1:08:37] the pain of when he left and took the
[1:08:38] inheritance all those things I'm just
[1:08:40] kind of filling in the you know what his
[1:08:42] father could have said to him you know
[1:08:43] why can't you be happy he's he's part of
[1:08:45] you he's your family he's got the last
[1:08:47] last surname as you he was raised with
[1:08:50] you he used to play together all these
[1:08:51] things but this guy is just not happy
[1:08:54] why because he came down with an elder
[1:08:56] brother syndrome wow and it can look so
[1:08:59] right but be so wrong see notice this
[1:09:00] you see it's selfish
[1:09:02] and he said unto him there so this is
[1:09:04] the father speaking now thy Brothers
[1:09:06] come and they um and thy father has
[1:09:09] killed the fatted calf because he hath
[1:09:10] received him safe and sound and he was
[1:09:13] angry yeah and would not go in
[1:09:16] that's an angry face
[1:09:18] in case you're wondering that's an angry
[1:09:19] face that guy's mad
[1:09:22] the greatest the greatest thing that
[1:09:23] could happen to the family outside of a
[1:09:25] wedding has just happened
[1:09:26] I'd say it's even greater than a wedding
[1:09:28] because he was lost and now he's found
[1:09:29] he was dead and trespasses and sins and
[1:09:31] now he's saved so it's the greatest
[1:09:33] thing I'm in the salvation of a soul The
[1:09:36] Prodigal Son coming home the answer to
[1:09:38] prayer is just walked in the door
[1:09:40] Hallelujah the prayers and the and the
[1:09:42] crying out the fasting and praying has
[1:09:43] just been manifested in their home and
[1:09:46] he's got an angry face
[1:09:48] why because he's selfish
[1:09:51] and he was angry and would not go in
[1:09:52] well he's throwing a tantrum
[1:09:55] I'm not going in there therefore came
[1:09:57] his father out and entreated him
[1:09:59] and he answered and said to his father
[1:10:00] Lo these many years now notice the I and
[1:10:03] the me and all these things Lo these
[1:10:05] many years uh do I serve thee neither
[1:10:08] transgressed I at any time my
[1:10:10] commandment and yet thou has never given
[1:10:12] me a kid
[1:10:13] this is not fair look see he's being
[1:10:16] selfish what what should I get out of
[1:10:18] this deal see you had to sell this Farm
[1:10:22] or you had to do whatever to give him
[1:10:23] his inheritance he spent it all he
[1:10:25] enjoyed it all I've never left I was
[1:10:28] raised in church I've always been good
[1:10:30] I've always been serving along and look
[1:10:32] someone else comes in from the world you
[1:10:34] make a big Fanfare what about me
[1:10:36] so I'll just bring it into today's
[1:10:38] language we should always be happy we
[1:10:40] should never have any elder brother
[1:10:41] syndrome we should have we should have
[1:10:43] the Father's Heart see see the elder
[1:10:46] brother did not know the heart of his
[1:10:47] own father though he worked for him he
[1:10:49] served them he had communication with
[1:10:51] him but he didn't know his father's
[1:10:52] heart see his father's heart was mercy
[1:10:55] and Redemption and that's what was the
[1:10:57] heart of the father and that is the
[1:10:59] heart of the father today our Lord Jesus
[1:11:01] Christ it's mercy and Redemption
[1:11:04] outside of that we have lost sight of
[1:11:06] why we're here amen and we should ever
[1:11:08] lose sight of why we're here that's why
[1:11:10] I say and you know we should never
[1:11:12] forget where we came from
[1:11:15] we came from a lot of deep dark pits but
[1:11:18] we didn't stay in those deep dark pits
[1:11:20] amen of Despair and pain wherever we're
[1:11:23] from the world trouble whatever it is
[1:11:24] but remember God can reach down further
[1:11:27] than we can even look up Hallelujah so
[1:11:29] we must never forget amen that where we
[1:11:32] came from
[1:11:33] they say well I feel so condemned by
[1:11:35] those memories no you shouldn't feel
[1:11:37] condemned amen you should actually be
[1:11:38] thankful God allows us to remember our
[1:11:41] past that we stay thankful not to hold
[1:11:43] us over us like a big weight no because
[1:11:45] remember you've got to go from those
[1:11:47] memories and keep walking maybe a few
[1:11:49] days until we felt where he found you
[1:11:51] and you're no longer that person no more
[1:11:53] amen Hallelujah amen see yet thou has
[1:11:57] never given me a kid did I make Mary
[1:11:59] with my friends but as soon as this thy
[1:12:01] son has come didn't even say as soon as
[1:12:03] my brother came you know or this thy son
[1:12:06] let's all be distant now and you know
[1:12:08] you know oh that's just a new believer
[1:12:11] you know brother Ram says that someone
[1:12:13] who's really given their hearts to the
[1:12:14] Lord come under the blood of Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ has more Authority with God than
[1:12:18] an archangel in heaven that never fell
[1:12:22] no he's just brother man come on come on
[1:12:25] what's wrong yeah we should just look at
[1:12:27] each other you're my brother you're my
[1:12:28] sister Hallelujah you know that's how we
[1:12:31] should die it's not all this thy son no
[1:12:33] let's get rid of that which has devoured
[1:12:36] thy living with harlots thou has killed
[1:12:38] for him the fatter calf so he's like
[1:12:40] look you didn't even give me a kid like
[1:12:42] a goat baby goat and look you're killing
[1:12:43] the fanica for this guy
[1:12:45] see if it was the other way around I
[1:12:48] think he'd be happier
[1:12:49] why because it's selfish ambition
[1:12:52] and he said unto him son thou art ever
[1:12:54] with me and all that I have is thine it
[1:12:56] was meat that we should make Miriam be
[1:12:58] glad for this thy brother was dead and
[1:12:59] is alive again and was lost and is found
[1:13:02] so we never want to be we never want to
[1:13:05] have the elder brother syndrome
[1:13:08] where someone starts walking comes back
[1:13:11] to the Lord or comes because they want
[1:13:13] to get back to him and we push them down
[1:13:16] we say you'll never make it you know
[1:13:18] some some young person who wants to
[1:13:21] serve God we should never kick each
[1:13:22] other down
[1:13:24] you're ordained to make one person a
[1:13:27] punching bag
[1:13:29] the devil
[1:13:30] you are just go for it have at it have
[1:13:33] at it as long as you want with all the
[1:13:35] feeling you've got just just give them
[1:13:37] heaps okay you just give them heaps but
[1:13:39] don't ever
[1:13:41] pull pull some Friendly Fire
[1:13:43] you know terrorism you know sleeper
[1:13:45] cells are a problem
[1:13:47] even today in Europe different things
[1:13:49] that you know they're worried about
[1:13:50] sleeper cells who know what a Sleeper
[1:13:52] Cell is it's a terrorist organization
[1:13:54] and they just plant people in a society
[1:13:56] and they blend in and they do everything
[1:13:58] but in their hearts they're going to do
[1:14:00] something very different and then there
[1:14:01] Comes A Time to strike and they blow
[1:14:03] stuff up they murder people do horrible
[1:14:05] things why because it was asleep but now
[1:14:07] it comes awake now we never want to be a
[1:14:09] Sleeper Cell
[1:14:10] where it's a lot of looks like Friendly
[1:14:12] Fire you know where where people start
[1:14:15] shooting one another instead of shooting
[1:14:16] the devil to me that's terrorism
[1:14:19] we don't want to be terrorists we're not
[1:14:21] here to shoot each other you know we
[1:14:23] should never have any Friendly Fire of
[1:14:25] well if you're really a Christian you
[1:14:26] wouldn't do this
[1:14:28] that person's pummeled on the ground are
[1:14:30] they alive I don't know you know and
[1:14:32] then they and then they leave the Lord
[1:14:34] they say well I knew that I'd leave they
[1:14:35] couldn't take correction but what's the
[1:14:37] motive behind what you're saying to them
[1:14:38] see it's amazing brother Brown makes a
[1:14:41] statement now it's amazing how much he
[1:14:43] talks about selfishness
[1:14:44] mate talks about it so much it's really
[1:14:47] really interesting now
[1:14:50] he says and I recognized the other day a
[1:14:52] selfish Spirit coming up in me of saying
[1:14:54] this man is wrong I ought to tell him
[1:14:56] about it
[1:14:57] that's wrong
[1:14:59] you say well wouldn't that be the right
[1:15:01] thing to do
[1:15:02] what is your ambition is your ambition
[1:15:05] basically the conclusion of your
[1:15:06] conversations I'm better than you I'm
[1:15:08] more Christian than you you know I'm
[1:15:10] more I'm more Sanctified than you if
[1:15:13] that's your ambition it's a selfish
[1:15:15] spirit
[1:15:16] because you're trying to make yourself
[1:15:17] look Superior to someone else a Silver
[1:15:19] Spirit coming up in me of saying this
[1:15:21] man's wrong I ought to tell him about it
[1:15:23] that's wrong God is the one who tells
[1:15:25] them about it that's it's none of my
[1:15:27] business but my business is to preach
[1:15:29] the gospel and love everybody and move
[1:15:31] on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ
[1:15:33] loved me when I was his enemy that's
[1:15:35] right when I was unlovely who remembers
[1:15:37] those times when you're unlovely very
[1:15:39] much I'll put both hands up because I
[1:15:41] remember those times sometimes I still
[1:15:43] think I'm unlovely but yeah he loved me
[1:15:46] to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely
[1:15:50] let me love them the same let the spirit
[1:15:52] that was in Christ be in US amen I love
[1:15:55] him I love him oh my
[1:15:57] so we must never get to a point where we
[1:15:59] just wreck someone over the coals
[1:16:02] because they may be struggling or doing
[1:16:03] something we you know we need the spirit
[1:16:06] of the Lord
[1:16:07] if you really care about someone just
[1:16:09] like yo you have children start acting
[1:16:12] up parents other parents
[1:16:15] don't put them under a put them in an
[1:16:17] interrogation seat and just just pour
[1:16:19] into the ninth degree throw the book of
[1:16:20] them if you really care about them talk
[1:16:22] to their parents
[1:16:25] right that's what we should do why do we
[1:16:28] yeah a lot of time people just want to
[1:16:29] blow someone up I feel better now I got
[1:16:31] that off my chest look at the Carnage
[1:16:33] you've just caused how was that the Lord
[1:16:37] no selfish ambition
[1:16:39] luciferian nature that needs to be burnt
[1:16:41] out
[1:16:42] see we should never ever have we should
[1:16:45] be able to recognize a selfish Spirit
[1:16:46] you say well that just grinds my gears
[1:16:48] when that person does that maybe it's
[1:16:50] something in you that needs to be ground
[1:16:51] out
[1:16:52] maybe that's something in you that you
[1:16:54] actually want to do but oh I'll look bad
[1:16:57] see we should serve God from our hearts
[1:16:59] say
[1:17:00] this is not a Conformity this is not a
[1:17:02] communistic idea where you've got to
[1:17:04] wear the same uniform and do all the
[1:17:05] same things no we live according to the
[1:17:07] word of God because we love him
[1:17:09] amen I trust that's not shocking to
[1:17:11] anyone no we serve him because we love
[1:17:14] him I'm not a Christian because I'm
[1:17:16] afraid of hell
[1:17:18] I'm not serving him because I'm a scared
[1:17:20] he's going to throw me away if he threw
[1:17:22] me into hell and I had the same spirit
[1:17:24] in me here that I have I'll love him now
[1:17:28] Hallelujah that's how I feel amen so we
[1:17:32] should never have a selfish Spirit
[1:17:33] coming in us now it's amazing we're
[1:17:36] we're
[1:17:37] even even motives let's just go here
[1:17:41] Brother Band talks about selfishness a
[1:17:42] lot go do a study it's very interesting
[1:17:44] then there's another little door he's
[1:17:45] talking about the door of a um of Hearts
[1:17:47] here that's right I'm around the corner
[1:17:49] another little door and that's the door
[1:17:51] of selfishness I'll let you in Lord I'll
[1:17:53] join your church and then just to see
[1:17:55] what I can get out of it that's
[1:17:57] selfishness
[1:17:58] I want the Holy Ghost why
[1:18:01] why do you want it that that that that
[1:18:03] you'll become some great person that
[1:18:05] you'll think boy or do you wanna you
[1:18:08] wanna see the Holy Ghost he can live in
[1:18:09] your life that he can be glorified not
[1:18:12] that you can be glorified that he can be
[1:18:14] glorified oh Lord I want a testimony why
[1:18:16] do you want to testimony
[1:18:18] that you can put yourself in that
[1:18:20] testimony because remember every
[1:18:21] testimony is God's doing like brother
[1:18:24] I'm upset about the Ohio River where the
[1:18:25] pillar of fire came down the voice spoke
[1:18:27] out as John the Baptist 4 on the first
[1:18:29] coming of Christ your message before on
[1:18:30] the second he said I was just there when
[1:18:33] God turned up
[1:18:34] that was that was the prophet's attitude
[1:18:36] I was just there when he turned up and I
[1:18:38] think that should be our attitude too
[1:18:39] amen amen well what happened at Camp
[1:18:41] well I was just hearing God turned up
[1:18:43] Hallelujah yeah that's how we should be
[1:18:45] that should be our whole testimony I
[1:18:46] just happen to be in the same place at
[1:18:48] the right place at the right time and
[1:18:50] and it wasn't even me leading me there
[1:18:51] as God himself for him to show up and do
[1:18:53] what he wanted to do so why do we want a
[1:18:56] testimony
[1:18:58] amen why do we want a Ministry why do we
[1:19:00] want a song we didn't do specials and
[1:19:02] play and things what's the motive behind
[1:19:03] it
[1:19:04] oh my
[1:19:07] God see and sometimes that gets into
[1:19:09] preachers you know they say well I'll be
[1:19:11] a minister if anyone if everybody Pat me
[1:19:13] on the back and say you're a good fellow
[1:19:15] if everybody patted me on the back and
[1:19:17] said I was a good fella I'd get to the
[1:19:18] altar just quick as I could because I
[1:19:20] know there'd be something wrong because
[1:19:21] the Bible said woe unto you when all men
[1:19:24] speak well of you see the world knows
[1:19:27] its own the world will hate you but God
[1:19:30] will love you and this little selfish
[1:19:32] you know how long we could dwell on that
[1:19:34] selfishness my you say well I just want
[1:19:37] to be loved by everyone you won't be
[1:19:38] loved by everyone
[1:19:40] yeah politicians try and do that it just
[1:19:42] doesn't work and we're not politicians
[1:19:44] this is not a parliament amen we're not
[1:19:46] a democracy in that way no I'd rather be
[1:19:49] kicked out of Earth and be accepted into
[1:19:51] heaven than be accepted down here and
[1:19:53] kicked out of heaven
[1:19:55] amen so you know let's just love the
[1:19:58] Lord eh I think it's real important now
[1:20:00] but you see even it's amazing because
[1:20:03] even the you say well I want to do
[1:20:05] something and it's according to the word
[1:20:06] but what's your ambition to do it
[1:20:08] because a selfish ambition will actually
[1:20:11] stop that happening the it'll actually
[1:20:13] be wrong I'm just going to read a bit
[1:20:15] because this is fascinating this is a
[1:20:17] Methodist Minister I was just sitting in
[1:20:19] the car a few moments ago that had come
[1:20:21] down with me very fine beloved brother
[1:20:22] and wife and family we were speaking
[1:20:24] about that just before coming into the
[1:20:26] building and he was saying I said the
[1:20:28] first thing that I always try and find
[1:20:30] out brother Collins was whether it was
[1:20:32] God's will or not to do a certain thing
[1:20:34] that's pretty straightforward yeah
[1:20:36] that's in the word if you stay in the
[1:20:38] word you're fine
[1:20:41] right it's not a what about sub Clause a
[1:20:43] b and second opinions 25 no forget that
[1:20:46] if it's in the word and the boundaries
[1:20:48] of the word that's God's will
[1:20:51] right
[1:20:52] um oh my where are we where are we
[1:20:54] looking here there we are right see
[1:20:57] um and I know it's God's will and I'm
[1:20:58] doing it for the purp it's the and if I
[1:21:01] uh sorry uh or was whether it was God's
[1:21:05] will or not to do a certain thing and
[1:21:06] then test my motive towards doing it and
[1:21:09] if I have no selfishness nothing and I
[1:21:12] know it's God's will and I'm doing it
[1:21:14] for that purpose because it's his will
[1:21:16] he won't fail you then
[1:21:18] so if there's not a selfish ambition
[1:21:20] behind it then God won't value
[1:21:23] I mean but if it's his will and you've
[1:21:25] got a selfish motive in it it's just the
[1:21:27] same as not being his will because it
[1:21:28] won't work isn't that incredible maybe
[1:21:31] or it can be it can be completely the
[1:21:32] word of God nothing contrary to the word
[1:21:34] of God but yet if there's selfish
[1:21:36] ambition injected God won't stand for it
[1:21:38] and it's just like you're actually
[1:21:40] outside of the will of God Amen because
[1:21:43] it just won't work that's amazing when
[1:21:46] you even think about people who start
[1:21:48] becoming preachers and pastors so on if
[1:21:50] they have us if they have a selfish
[1:21:52] motive behind what they're doing they'll
[1:21:54] never have a successful Fellowship it
[1:21:56] will never grow spiritually in terms of
[1:21:58] character I'm not talking about numbers
[1:21:59] because not even a numbers things about
[1:22:01] the character of Christ God moving his
[1:22:03] word manifesting but if their motive is
[1:22:06] well I've got to prove a point I've got
[1:22:07] to be somebody I want to show you that
[1:22:09] you know it's amazing how a whole church
[1:22:11] movements will start because people just
[1:22:12] get have a selfish motive
[1:22:15] King Henry VII of England started the
[1:22:17] Anglican church because he wanted a
[1:22:19] divorce
[1:22:21] oh but it's part of the Reformation
[1:22:23] brother Ben and God's restoring his word
[1:22:25] reforming no he started that church
[1:22:27] because he wanted a divorce the pope
[1:22:29] wouldn't give him a divorce
[1:22:30] that was his ambition that was his
[1:22:33] reasoning behind the Anglican Church
[1:22:34] that we see around the world today it
[1:22:37] started because he wanted a divorce
[1:22:39] that's selfish man yeah
[1:22:42] should be a unanimous amen right there
[1:22:44] amen but you see that will see his
[1:22:46] motive wasn't pure right it was see and
[1:22:50] then and that's just the yellow bit
[1:22:51] there and though and though we can see
[1:22:54] the wrath of man praising God in such
[1:22:56] events as Henry VII taking up for the
[1:22:58] reformation and the rejection of papal
[1:22:59] Authority it's a far cry from the truth
[1:23:01] of Pentecost and protection of an
[1:23:03] omnipotent God he was annoyed at the
[1:23:05] pope so he did his own thing people get
[1:23:07] annoyed at churches Ministries the word
[1:23:09] whatever they go do their own thing
[1:23:11] that's a selfish motive we don't want to
[1:23:13] be that way who's who's still with me
[1:23:15] today okay we'll be done soon you know
[1:23:17] just just just hold tight you know I
[1:23:19] don't know where this is going to end
[1:23:20] because my slides aren't in order
[1:23:21] anymore but we'll get off somewhere and
[1:23:23] have lunch okay or go on a Rapture
[1:23:24] whatever's I'd rather go and Rapture but
[1:23:26] you see we don't we don't want to have a
[1:23:29] selfish motive in anything we do
[1:23:32] how we raise our children we don't want
[1:23:34] to be selfish right we don't want to
[1:23:36] look the part because so we'll look
[1:23:38] better than someone else no one's last
[1:23:40] name here is the Jones Jones is a
[1:23:43] praise God if brother Jones comes in
[1:23:45] well hey we'll just love him and he'll
[1:23:47] understand but we're not here to keep up
[1:23:48] with the Joneses we're not here to
[1:23:50] compare and say well this church is like
[1:23:52] this so we need to be like this or this
[1:23:54] ministry is like this so we should have
[1:23:55] this kind of ministry no or this
[1:23:57] family's like this we should be like
[1:23:58] this or I'm glad I'm not like that
[1:24:01] that's selfish because it's all about
[1:24:03] you or me in the picture we've got to
[1:24:05] get rid of all that uh thinking now I'm
[1:24:07] not saying we have this but you know may
[1:24:09] we never be selfish
[1:24:12] amen because you know selfishness can
[1:24:14] come in
[1:24:16] it's a very it's a very dangerous thing
[1:24:19] now
[1:24:20] we know when Jesus was baptized John
[1:24:23] John said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:24:25] takes away the sin of the world and the
[1:24:26] spirit of God descended upon the Lord
[1:24:28] Jesus like a dove now we know a lamb and
[1:24:30] a dove have the same kind of nature Meek
[1:24:32] gentle timid creatures right and so
[1:24:35] because they were the same nature they
[1:24:37] could they could dwell together now when
[1:24:40] we are born we are not born with a lamb
[1:24:42] or a dove nature doesn't matter how see
[1:24:45] someone can be very quiet but they can
[1:24:46] be a wolf man
[1:24:48] they can see be because the Bible says
[1:24:50] even a fool that doesn't speak much is
[1:24:52] counted wise
[1:24:53] right but
[1:24:56] anyway that's what Proverbs is right so
[1:24:59] even if someone doesn't talk much man
[1:25:00] they're wise they can be the dumbest
[1:25:01] thing out you know in terms of
[1:25:03] foolishness I'm not talking about how
[1:25:05] smart they are doing doing school work
[1:25:07] I'm talking about speaking Street wise
[1:25:09] in terms of how God works and how you
[1:25:11] know how the world is and different
[1:25:12] things right so we don't want to be
[1:25:14] fools but you see now we're born with a
[1:25:16] wolf nature
[1:25:17] and that's why we need a real New Birth
[1:25:19] experience that God changes our nature
[1:25:22] to be like his nature then the spirit of
[1:25:24] God the dove amen can come and dwell in
[1:25:26] our hearts and live in our lives but you
[1:25:28] see we have this thing where this body
[1:25:30] is not converted so there is a wolf
[1:25:33] nature living in all of us
[1:25:37] yeah amen I'm glad someone's honest
[1:25:39] there amen you know this flesh must be
[1:25:42] be changed and we're going to be happy
[1:25:45] when that day happens
[1:25:47] Hallelujah not because there's the
[1:25:49] creeks and the pains and things of
[1:25:52] getting older no because this nature
[1:25:53] that you wrestle with right but if the
[1:25:55] Holy Ghost comes in then God gives you
[1:25:57] power to subdue that nature I mean
[1:26:00] that's why we never live by our feelings
[1:26:02] your feelings will rob you of every
[1:26:04] blessing of God it can you feel up you
[1:26:06] feel down sideways you feel like there's
[1:26:08] no way you could ever be saved the next
[1:26:09] day you feel like man I'm going to stomp
[1:26:11] on every devil in hell and you know
[1:26:12] because you go up and down right we
[1:26:14] don't go by feeling we go by faith
[1:26:17] amen the word of God hallelujah so we
[1:26:19] walk by that but you see now what
[1:26:21] happens is we can let things come in you
[1:26:23] see now brother Brahm says if the Lamb
[1:26:26] of God would would have made the first
[1:26:28] snow like a wolf or would have done
[1:26:30] anything contrary to what the gentle
[1:26:31] Dove would have permitted the dove would
[1:26:33] have took her flight she would have left
[1:26:35] in a minute and that's the reason and
[1:26:37] that's the reason today that we're
[1:26:39] wondering what's the matter with the
[1:26:40] Pentecostal church I'll say what's the
[1:26:41] matter with the message because I love
[1:26:43] to bring these things into here there's
[1:26:44] no point just
[1:26:46] uh you know I you know I enjoyed being
[1:26:48] um you know spending time on my uncles
[1:26:49] and Friends Farms growing up but I never
[1:26:51] pitchforked hay and I don't want to
[1:26:54] start
[1:26:55] right I'm not here to Pitchfork I don't
[1:26:57] even have a pitchfork right so any of
[1:26:59] these kind of things I don't say oh
[1:27:00] you're those people no I always bring it
[1:27:02] down home amen I like that kind of thing
[1:27:04] it's because you've taken on a different
[1:27:06] nature you've taken on the uh on a
[1:27:08] nature that we won our rights we're
[1:27:10] going to do what we know is right to do
[1:27:12] and we become arrogant we become hostile
[1:27:15] we become indifferent we let temper come
[1:27:18] in we let selfishness come in why
[1:27:20] because it's all about me amen so so
[1:27:22] when brother bands talk about this he's
[1:27:24] not saying these people and uh these
[1:27:27] people are not converted right they're
[1:27:29] saying that they've allowed the wolf
[1:27:32] nature of their flesh to rise up a
[1:27:33] cardinality to rise up that the spirit
[1:27:35] of God takes its flight now we know the
[1:27:37] Bible says don't grieve the Holy Ghost
[1:27:39] we're by your seal to the day of your
[1:27:41] Redemption so we can grieve them but
[1:27:43] doesn't mean we lose our ceiling right
[1:27:46] it doesn't mean we have to go back and
[1:27:48] be you know doesn't mean we become a
[1:27:50] sinner again we've got to get baptized
[1:27:52] and start all over again no we just have
[1:27:54] Grieves them so the holy spirit is like
[1:27:56] a dove he goes up in the rafters waiting
[1:27:58] for our heart to come right again
[1:27:59] waiting for us to repent and then that
[1:28:01] sweetness and gentleness and love of God
[1:28:03] comes back in amen because we all know
[1:28:05] when we're carnal
[1:28:07] if you're mainly carnal most of the time
[1:28:10] you need an altar
[1:28:13] right because it shouldn't just be a
[1:28:15] constant do good Do Bad No it should be
[1:28:17] an overcoming your life should be
[1:28:19] trending upwards
[1:28:20] closer to God more like God you're sure
[1:28:22] you have your dips and valleys but but
[1:28:24] the
[1:28:25] overall trend of your life should be
[1:28:26] like this
[1:28:28] amen that to me that's overcoming
[1:28:31] amen so see so we become we let
[1:28:33] selfishness come in so we don't want to
[1:28:35] let selfishness ever come in
[1:28:38] amen where we begin to think we're right
[1:28:40] and everyone else is wrong we do
[1:28:41] everything out of a selfish ambition he
[1:28:44] says now would you stand out to sing his
[1:28:46] presence here and know that that he's
[1:28:48] here look the holy spirit's Witnesses
[1:28:50] see the scientific world says it's here
[1:28:52] the Bible says it's here what are we
[1:28:53] going to do about it are we going to
[1:28:55] turn our back on it and walk away say
[1:28:57] well I'm Presbyterian while I'm Lutheran
[1:28:59] I'm Pentecostal I'm as good as anybody
[1:29:01] else oh brother that's a selfish thing
[1:29:03] so you say well I was raises in the
[1:29:05] message I've been baptized right I'm as
[1:29:07] good as anyone else that's a selfish
[1:29:09] thing amen we never want to be into that
[1:29:11] kind of a state we want to say Lord
[1:29:12] change me make me more like you all of
[1:29:16] my life may not be selfish may it not be
[1:29:18] see people will pull deals that they
[1:29:20] benefit out of it mainly it may look so
[1:29:23] good for everyone else but actually they
[1:29:25] just want to pull a deal that they get
[1:29:27] the greatest benefit that's a selfish
[1:29:29] deal it can look right on the outside
[1:29:31] but really what's the what's the
[1:29:33] conclusion of the matter
[1:29:35] I see some of you thinking very deeply
[1:29:37] some of you have left the building come
[1:29:39] back today but you know we're going to
[1:29:41] be careful what's the motive that we
[1:29:43] that that we're Believers what's the
[1:29:45] motive that we have children we raise
[1:29:46] them a certain way what's the motive of
[1:29:48] how we treat our spouses and different
[1:29:50] things is it selfish
[1:29:52] or is it they their life is more
[1:29:55] important than your own
[1:29:58] because any any selfish ambition grounds
[1:30:01] the power of God
[1:30:03] see we can have the truth we can we can
[1:30:06] know all the truth we know the words
[1:30:08] open all these great Revelations and
[1:30:09] things that God has opened up in this
[1:30:11] day
[1:30:12] but if we have a selfish objective it'll
[1:30:15] ground the power of God remember the
[1:30:16] full purpose of God restoring his word
[1:30:18] is that the Holy Ghost would have free
[1:30:20] course like never before and moving
[1:30:22] great power but if there's selfishness
[1:30:24] in our hearts amen it grounds the power
[1:30:26] of God right there doesn't matter how
[1:30:28] true it is how great it is you know it
[1:30:31] doesn't matter our objective if we have
[1:30:33] selfishness in our hearts the power of
[1:30:35] God will not move and that's what we
[1:30:37] want Above All Things is the power of
[1:30:38] God to move remember it's the power of
[1:30:40] God that changes Hearts the power of God
[1:30:43] that saves us the power of God that
[1:30:44] heals the power of God that redeems is
[1:30:46] the power of God that casts out demon
[1:30:48] powers right so we'd never ever want to
[1:30:50] have a selfish objective of a look at me
[1:30:54] it's all about me I'm better than the
[1:30:56] next guy no remember who who are we
[1:31:00] comparing to
[1:31:02] are we comparing to the word is the word
[1:31:04] our mirror that we compare to or is it
[1:31:06] each other
[1:31:08] I trust your mirror is not me yeah
[1:31:10] you've got a real crazy Wharf tomorrow
[1:31:12] if you're looking at me you're going to
[1:31:13] look at the right mirror who's who's
[1:31:15] ever been in one of those mirrors where
[1:31:16] he goes real big your legs are small and
[1:31:18] all those you know that's a crazy mirror
[1:31:20] and people look at me and look what I
[1:31:22] look like no you're looking at the wrong
[1:31:23] image you got to look at a right mirror
[1:31:26] which is the image of God's word
[1:31:28] amen not to not to be selfish not to be
[1:31:31] patronizing you see there are some
[1:31:34] people in the Bible that were not
[1:31:36] selfish now we can talk about the
[1:31:37] scribes and Pharisees we never went to
[1:31:39] that but you know well necessarily but
[1:31:41] you know
[1:31:42] there's some people who are not selfish
[1:31:44] see a real believer is not selfish when
[1:31:47] Abraham and lots Hersman were having
[1:31:49] strive God let um Abraham said a lot
[1:31:51] well you take you take the best bit yeah
[1:31:54] why because he wasn't selfish see a real
[1:31:57] believer he has no selfishness in him at
[1:32:00] all
[1:32:00] amen that's how we should be like amen
[1:32:03] when Hannah went to the Tabernacle and
[1:32:06] was crying out to God for a child amen
[1:32:08] her her desire wasn't a selfish desire
[1:32:12] because she was willing to give that
[1:32:15] child back to God
[1:32:17] amen CeCe see it's a it's a noble thing
[1:32:20] to to want God to answer prayer but
[1:32:22] what's the motive behind it
[1:32:24] see her motive was Lord whatever you
[1:32:26] give me I'm going to give back to you
[1:32:28] amen and because God knew that she would
[1:32:31] do it that way
[1:32:32] she gave he gave her a greater blessing
[1:32:35] a prophet that changed dispensations
[1:32:37] from judges to the line of Kings amen
[1:32:40] goes why because I'm Samuel anointed saw
[1:32:42] the anointed king David right so so you
[1:32:45] know what is our what is our motive yeah
[1:32:48] you know we're going to be careful
[1:32:50] because sometimes God will even answer
[1:32:52] selfish prayer
[1:32:53] Balaam Balaam uh was hired by by Moab to
[1:32:57] curse Israel
[1:32:59] with money his whole purpose of being
[1:33:01] hired was selfish I want to become rich
[1:33:03] and he had the right approach to God the
[1:33:06] same approach to God that Moses did the
[1:33:07] number of sacrifices and things but if
[1:33:10] but his motive to call down the presence
[1:33:12] of God was selfish
[1:33:15] we're going to be really careful he said
[1:33:18] but God answers my prayers but what's
[1:33:19] the motive in your heart
[1:33:21] he even prophesied true his prophecies
[1:33:23] are still ringing out today you read
[1:33:25] numbers 22-25 see but his motives were
[1:33:29] selfish
[1:33:30] he said but God's answered my prayers
[1:33:32] here therefore he therefore I must be
[1:33:33] right with him not necessarily
[1:33:36] that's why you've got to say Lord I want
[1:33:38] to line up with your word whatever you
[1:33:41] want me to be Lord I want to be that I
[1:33:43] don't want to justify my Christian walk
[1:33:45] in anything see many people try and they
[1:33:48] want their experience to be their
[1:33:49] ultimate we want the word of God to be
[1:33:51] our ultimate sure he gives us
[1:33:53] experiences we could stand here for a
[1:33:55] very long time and share Supernatural
[1:33:56] experiences we know those things right
[1:33:58] but you see we don't want to say well
[1:33:59] God's blessing therefore I must be right
[1:34:01] now we're right because we want him to
[1:34:04] live according to his word in our lives
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:07] amen
[1:34:09] Hallelujah now we're just going to
[1:34:11] finish with this because it's our time
[1:34:13] now maybe somebody would say brother saw
[1:34:15] brother Paul we want you to come over
[1:34:17] here because you've got the biggest
[1:34:18] church uh we've got the biggest
[1:34:20] congregation your offerings will be
[1:34:21] great and so forth but being pressed in
[1:34:23] the spirit he thought I've got a brother
[1:34:24] over there I'd like you to go over and
[1:34:27] save this brother get him to the Lord
[1:34:28] but yet the spirit pressed him to go
[1:34:30] somewhere else he was a prisoner see
[1:34:33] this was a man who had no selfish
[1:34:35] objectives when he was a Pharisee the
[1:34:38] Pharisees that was selfish because the
[1:34:39] prestige that came with that look at me
[1:34:41] I yo people would bow my presence oh
[1:34:43] we'll ask we'll ask brother Saul because
[1:34:46] he's an authority on the Torah all these
[1:34:48] things it was a selfish a self objective
[1:34:50] right but when he met the Lord on the
[1:34:53] road to Damascus God burn that out of
[1:34:55] him Paula they didn't care about his
[1:34:57] reputation didn't care about Prestige
[1:34:59] what people thought of him all he wanted
[1:35:01] to do was that the Lord would be
[1:35:02] glorified in his life and when Paul
[1:35:05] wrote Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ he
[1:35:07] wasn't just talking about the natural
[1:35:09] prison bars no that was not what he's
[1:35:11] talking about he's not being a prisoner
[1:35:13] to the Lord that even he wouldn't even
[1:35:16] do his own will
[1:35:18] amen yeah that is someone who has no
[1:35:20] selfishness in them it's a foreign
[1:35:23] strange thing amen and that's what we
[1:35:25] want to be oh God make us prisoners like
[1:35:28] that from our own selfish ambition and
[1:35:31] from our own judgments and our Better
[1:35:32] Way overthinking to be a prisoner of
[1:35:35] Jesus Christ I think that that was a
[1:35:38] great statement that I'm a prisoner to
[1:35:40] Jesus Christ
[1:35:42] amen I trust that your heart's desire
[1:35:44] this morning
[1:35:45] that you don't want to live in a way
[1:35:47] that you put people down and make
[1:35:48] yourself look better you're not
[1:35:50] condescending to one another that your
[1:35:52] motive of actually being a friend to
[1:35:54] someone is not that you get a benefit
[1:35:55] out of it
[1:35:57] amen and you're not a Believer so people
[1:35:59] think you're something
[1:36:02] amen you don't you don't play or preach
[1:36:05] or sing or whatever do Sunday school
[1:36:06] whatever it may be because people will
[1:36:08] think you're something greater than
[1:36:09] someone who doesn't that's selfish
[1:36:11] ambition you know you don't see we don't
[1:36:14] want to be like that we don't want to
[1:36:16] ground the power of God
[1:36:18] we want the Lord to live amen let's um

[1:36:39] may we never look down on someone who
[1:36:41] wants to serve God
[1:36:43] right how can we ever think of
[1:36:46] someone who wants to serve God and push
[1:36:48] them down
[1:36:50] I don't even want to see that look on
[1:36:52] anyone's face including mine
[1:36:54] you know here's a testimony just walks
[1:36:56] on the door and look what he's doing
