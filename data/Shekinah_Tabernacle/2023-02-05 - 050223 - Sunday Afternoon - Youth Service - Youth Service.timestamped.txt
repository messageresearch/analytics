[30:14] the bishop brothers and sisters
[30:17] um by the being actually preached my
[30:19] sermon exactly this morning which was
[30:21] amazing but um it just goes to show you
[30:24] know the Lord moves in the channel so
[30:26] we're grateful for that
[30:28] um okay we're just telling our Bibles to
[30:29] uh second Peter one
[30:32] verse 4.
[30:53] 4
[31:00] I mean um I just want to speak this
[31:03] afternoon on um the Believers promises
[31:06] uh we we have you know the law has given
[31:09] us the Bible and it's full of promises
[31:11] and I believe it's absolutely relevant
[31:13] to us in this day and age and um it's
[31:16] it's there for us to walk be able to
[31:19] walk a Victoria's life and know where we
[31:20] are in this life
[31:23] um all right second Peter 1 verse four
[31:27] whereby are given unto a succeeding
[31:29] great and precious promises that by
[31:32] these you might be partakers of the
[31:33] divine nature having escaped the
[31:36] corruption that is in the world through
[31:37] lust
[31:39] and then just if we can tune to Hebrews
[31:41] 11 33
[31:55] .
[31:56] uh we'll start with verse 32.
[32:00] and what more shall and what shall I
[32:02] more say for the time would fail me to
[32:04] tell if Gideon and of Barack and of
[32:06] Samson and devta and David also and
[32:09] Samuel and of the prophets who through
[32:11] faith subdued kingdoms and wrought
[32:13] righteousness obtained promises stop the
[32:16] mouths of lions quench the violence of
[32:19] fire escape the edge of the sword out of
[32:21] weakness were made strong waxed Valiant
[32:24] and fight turned to flight the armies of
[32:26] the aliens
[32:27] women receive their date the life again
[32:29] and others were tortured not accepting
[32:31] Deliverance that they might obtain a bit
[32:33] of Resurrection
[32:35] I mean you can have your seats
[32:39] and uh like we can see with each of
[32:42] these Believers that was just mentioned
[32:44] they they all had a promise to them that
[32:48] they um the lord gave them to inherit
[32:50] and they all had Giants in their life
[32:52] that they had to overcome
[32:55] and you know every blessing that there
[32:58] is there's probably an amalekite or some
[33:00] enemy sitting there guarding it and with
[33:03] and but the Lord has said that he's
[33:05] given it to us and we are well able to
[33:07] take it
[33:12] um and Deuteronomy 7 verse 1 it says
[33:14] it's um the account of uh of the Lord
[33:18] commanding Israel to take the promised
[33:19] land it says when the Lord thy God God
[33:22] shall bring thee into the land whether
[33:23] thou goes to possess it and hath cast
[33:26] out many nations before the the Hittites
[33:29] and the gurga sites and the amorites and
[33:31] the Canaanites and the perizzites and
[33:33] the highlights and the jebusites Seven
[33:36] Nations greater and mightier than now
[33:38] and when the Lord thy God shall live
[33:40] with him before thee Thou shalt Smite
[33:42] them and utterly destroy them they also
[33:45] make no Covenant with him nor show Mercy
[33:47] unto them
[33:48] and what I find amazing and that is
[33:51] the Bible says those nations are great
[33:53] they're mightier than you are
[33:55] um
[33:56] and I'm sure we've all come to a place
[33:57] in our lives where you come up against
[33:59] something and and you realize Lord if
[34:02] it's if you don't help me this is a
[34:04] hopeless case you've I need you and um
[34:10] and and and the Lord says
[34:13] he shall deliver them before thee Thou
[34:15] shalt Smite them and utterly destroy
[34:17] them and make no government with them
[34:19] we're not here to negotiate with the
[34:21] devil
[34:22] um as places under our feet and that's a
[34:24] period we we don't have to settle for
[34:26] for second best or or slightly
[34:29] substandard he's completely defeated
[34:33] um and uh and I'm so thankful you know
[34:35] greater is he that's in us than he
[34:37] that's in the world and he's already
[34:38] overcome the world
[34:41] um
[34:43] uh David says in the book of Samuel
[34:46] uh he said I have pursued my enemies and
[34:49] destroyed them and turned not again
[34:50] until I had consumed them
[34:53] and I I have consumed them and wounded
[34:55] them that they could not arise yay they
[34:58] have fallen under my feet so
[35:01] as it's given to us to pursue them and
[35:03] to destroy them until we have consumed
[35:05] them we don't have to we don't we can we
[35:08] can we can take everything that's in our
[35:10] promised land for us the law is given to
[35:12] us
[35:13] can we just alternate the second Samuel
[35:16] verse 2. chapter 2 verse 22.
[35:21] I'm not going to say anything new this
[35:24] afternoon but I believe it's very
[35:25] applicable anyway
[35:30] so David says for by Thee I have run
[35:32] through a troop and by my God I have
[35:34] leaped over a wall as for God his way is
[35:37] perfect the word of the Lord is tried he
[35:39] is a buckler to all those that trust in
[35:41] him
[35:42] but who is God save the Lord or who is a
[35:45] rock Save Our God
[35:47] it is God that girdeth me with strength
[35:49] and maketh my way perfect
[35:51] he maketh my feet like hein's feet and
[35:54] seatth me upon my high places
[35:56] he teacheth My Hands to War so that a
[35:58] bow of Steel is broken by mine arms
[36:01] there was also given me the shield of
[36:04] thy salvation
[36:06] and thy right hand can we just put it up
[36:07] on the screen please
[36:12] that was also given me the shield of thy
[36:14] salvation and thy right hand eth holding
[36:17] me up and thy gentleness hath made me
[36:20] great
[36:21] thou Hast enlarged my steps under me
[36:24] that my feet did not slip I have pursued
[36:27] my enemies and overtake them neither did
[36:30] I turn again till they were consumed I
[36:32] have wounded them that well they were
[36:34] not able to rise they have fallen under
[36:35] my feet
[36:37] for thou as good at me with strength
[36:39] unto the battle they also says subdued
[36:42] unto me those that rose up against me
[36:45] thou hath also given the next of my
[36:47] enemies that I might destroy them that
[36:49] hate me they cried but there was none to
[36:52] save them even unto the Lord but he
[36:53] answered them not
[36:55] then I debate them small as a dust
[36:57] before the wind I did cast him out as
[36:59] the dirt as dirt in the streets and uh
[37:03] I mean in this day and age we're not
[37:04] we're not killing Philistines and and
[37:07] physical people but it's um
[37:10] you know I believe as those strongholds
[37:12] in our lives or just just moving forward
[37:14] on the Lord having a deeper experience
[37:15] with them and um we can we can count
[37:18] them as dust under our feet
[37:23] and um I just want to speak about some
[37:26] of the promises that the Lord has given
[37:28] the believer in this day and age
[37:31] um has been through all ages but but for
[37:34] us today
[37:35] and um you know the word contains a lot
[37:37] of promises but I believe the word
[37:39] itself is also a promise
[37:41] um to us
[37:46] in Matthew 4 of us verse 4 it says sorry
[37:49] there's going to be a lot of reading or
[37:50] verses
[37:51] um I'm just reading basically repeating
[37:53] promises
[37:56] but he answered and said it was written
[37:58] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[38:01] every word that proceeds out of the
[38:02] mouth of God
[38:04] and you know there's there's several
[38:06] places in the Bible it says there's
[38:07] three or four times that the heavens and
[38:10] earth will pass away but my word shall
[38:12] not fail
[38:13] Psalms 119 says Thy word as a lamp unto
[38:17] my feet and a light unto my path
[38:21] and uh I think it was actually on one of
[38:23] the slides this morning by the Burnham
[38:25] says you know the word of God will
[38:26] defeat Satan anywhere any place any time
[38:30] under any conditions and may the Lord
[38:32] just make that real to us and help us to
[38:34] reach out and grab a hold of that
[38:37] and no matter what we Face the word of
[38:39] God as our victory
[38:41] Hebrews 4 says for the word of God is
[38:44] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[38:47] two-edged sword
[38:48] piercing either to the dividing asunder
[38:50] of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[38:52] Marrow and a discerner of the thoughts
[38:54] and intents of the heart
[38:57] can you please put up that quote Oneness
[39:00] um
[39:03] we all can see that
[39:07] for I believe that's the way we should
[39:09] do always weigh things with the word
[39:11] because the word is the only thing that
[39:13] will be able to remain
[39:14] Jesus said both Heaven and Earth
[39:18] will pass away but my word shall not
[39:20] pass away that's why I believe it and to
[39:23] believe it and believe it to be God's
[39:25] program I believe that that is the
[39:27] finished work of God wrote out in the
[39:29] word
[39:29] therefore that if anything would be
[39:31] contrary to that word it could not be
[39:33] God or God's plan
[39:35] I believe it's the program
[39:37] now the spirit of God and the word makes
[39:40] the word live itself act itself out it
[39:43] brings the word to life like a seed
[39:49] and you know sometimes in this junior of
[39:52] life we may get to a place where we
[39:54] think Lord
[39:55] why did this happen to me or why did you
[39:57] allow a certain thing in my life
[40:00] um
[40:01] wouldn't it have been better if it just
[40:02] wasn't then I didn't have to deal with
[40:03] in the first place
[40:05] um
[40:07] but I believe there's absolutely a
[40:09] purpose and a reason behind it and even
[40:11] if we can't see it right now or in the
[40:13] trial there will come a point
[40:15] once you're through it you can look back
[40:17] and you you can look at it and you can
[40:19] see why and um and you know the Bible
[40:23] says all things that work together for
[40:24] good to them that love God so whatever
[40:26] whatever the outcome is uh whatever you
[40:30] go through the outcome is is for your
[40:33] good
[40:37] yeah and and the thing is if we if we
[40:39] didn't struggle with certain things if
[40:41] there wasn't hard things in our lives
[40:42] how would we learn to overcome and how
[40:45] would we ever get closer to God they
[40:48] have to be there and they're there for
[40:49] us to overcome not to
[40:52] not to be defeated under
[40:55] Proverbs 3 verse 5 says trust in the
[40:59] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[41:01] unto thine own understanding
[41:03] so Lord help us just to put our thinking
[41:06] on a situation out of the out of the
[41:08] picture and trust in him
[41:09] and he will bring us through
[41:13] um
[41:16] one thing that's been made real to me
[41:18] recently and it was actually an
[41:20] exhortation given on Wednesday here
[41:23] um and and one thing that was said is
[41:25] he will navigate us through every
[41:27] obstacle every Iceberg he will do it and
[41:30] to fear not and you know it made me
[41:33] realize that
[41:35] um
[41:37] you know no matter what we go through
[41:39] the Lord's intimately aware of it he's
[41:41] he's he's intimately interested and
[41:44] aware of what you go through even if it
[41:45] doesn't feel feel like it sometimes
[41:52] and Jeremiah 29 it says for I know the
[41:55] thoughts that I think toward you saith
[41:57] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[41:59] evil to give you an expected end
[42:02] we're moving towards an expected end and
[42:04] each one of our Lives I believe that
[42:08] and uh something which spoke to my heart
[42:10] recently was in in Psalms it says the
[42:14] Lord will perfect that which concerneth
[42:15] me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever
[42:18] forsake not the work of thine own hands
[42:21] in his time he will perfect that which
[42:23] concerneth you
[42:30] yeah and like Ben said this morning we
[42:33] are the workmanship of the lord we we
[42:35] are we are that Clay on his will and he
[42:37] knows how much how much we can take what
[42:40] we need to you know to be made in the
[42:42] vessel that he wants us to be
[42:46] and I just want to and and the thing is
[42:48] like being said this morning how do we
[42:51] possess those promises
[42:52] um what's the key and and the key is
[42:54] faith
[42:55] the Bible says we walk by faith not by
[42:58] sight
[43:00] and uh in Hebrews 11 where it talks
[43:02] about all those Believers how through
[43:05] faith that overcame
[43:07] um
[43:09] it says through faith also Sarah herself
[43:11] receives strength to conceive seed and
[43:14] was delivered of a child when she was
[43:15] past aged because she judged him
[43:17] faithful who had promised
[43:19] she may have stumbled at the beginning
[43:21] but the law brought her through and she
[43:23] she came to that place where she
[43:24] believed
[43:26] and a little bit further it says by
[43:28] faith they pass through the Red Sea as
[43:30] by dry land which the Egyptians are
[43:33] saying to do were drowned
[43:35] those Egyptians in your life by faith
[43:37] they will be drowned
[43:39] and by faith the walls of Jericho fell
[43:42] down after they were compassed about
[43:44] seven days
[43:47] and as we read in the beginning that
[43:49] same verse
[43:51] um
[43:52] all these all these Believers through
[43:54] faith subdued kingdoms and righteousness
[43:56] obtain promises and stop the mouths of
[43:58] lions
[43:59] Queens the violence of fire escaped the
[44:01] edge of the sword out of weakness were
[44:03] made strong
[44:04] waxed the Valiant in a fight and turn to
[44:06] flight the armies of the aliens
[44:11] okay we put that second quote on there
[44:13] please
[44:14] um
[44:15] yeah
[44:17] he's ready to take that man dying with
[44:20] cancer that with the heart that was the
[44:23] heart trouble that that's blind that
[44:25] one's Afflicted if you'll just place his
[44:27] faith in there turn him around from
[44:29] Death unto life start him off with a
[44:32] testimony he's waiting to do it he puts
[44:34] you right in the Trap to see what you do
[44:36] he put them right down in that trap
[44:38] there looked like nature itself was
[44:40] hiding its face that was when um if you
[44:43] read a little bit further that was when
[44:44] the children of Israel was between the
[44:46] Red Sea and Pharaoh's Army
[44:50] um it looked like nature itself was
[44:52] hiding its face yes one writer said one
[44:54] time when they got in that place
[44:56] wondered what Moses would do had one
[44:59] command go forward if you're in the line
[45:02] of duty no matter what stays in the way
[45:05] the greatest experiences I've had is to
[45:07] come up against something I couldn't get
[45:09] over it or under it and just stand there
[45:11] and watch God make a way through it
[45:13] that's the way to do it just move keep
[45:15] moving press your nose against it just
[45:18] keep moving on just keep going on God
[45:21] Will Make A Way yeah I believe that

[50:18] it's like their policeman you know he's
[50:20] got no physical power to stop that those
[50:22] trucks and cars but
[50:24] um you know the law that empowers him is
[50:28] where the power lies and we can serve
[50:30] notice on the devil
[50:34] and uh just in closing I just want to
[50:36] say
[50:37] um what is your Mountain what's your
[50:39] giant
[50:40] you know the the enemy might be trying
[50:42] to make you worry and doubt and fear in
[50:44] a certain situation in your life
[50:46] and uh I'm just going to repeat some
[50:49] promises regarding that in Hebrews the
[50:52] Lord says he will never leave you nor
[50:53] forsake you
[50:55] in Romans it says all things work
[50:57] together for the good to them that love
[50:59] God to them who are called according to
[51:02] his purpose and Romans that says we are
[51:04] more than conquerors through him that
[51:06] loved us and if we feel insufficient
[51:08] ourselves to do it which we are
[51:11] the Bible says he giveth power to the
[51:13] faint and to them that have no Mighty
[51:16] increases strength
[51:18] and maybe maybe we don't understand
[51:20] certain situations the Lord has allowed
[51:22] in our lives
[51:23] but in Prophecy says trust in the Lord
[51:25] with all thine heart and lean not to
[51:27] their own understanding put your
[51:29] understanding away and trust in him
[51:32] Isaiah says for as their Heavens are
[51:34] higher than the earth so are my ways
[51:36] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[51:38] than your thoughts
[51:41] and Samuel it says as for God his way is
[51:44] perfect the word of the Lord has tried
[51:46] he is a buckler to all them that trust
[51:49] him
[51:50] Ecclesiastes and says he that he hath
[51:53] made everything beautiful in his time
[51:55] and uh this is my prayer Lord and and
[51:58] Philippians says and the peace of God
[52:00] which passes all understanding shall
[52:02] keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus
[52:05] and uh I believe every believer has
[52:08] access to the Lord no matter how young
[52:10] or how old you are
[52:15] in Hebrews it says for we have not in
[52:18] high priest which cannot be touched with
[52:19] the feeling of our infirmities but
[52:21] wasn't all points tempted like as we are
[52:24] yet without sin
[52:25] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[52:27] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[52:29] and Grace to help in times of need
[52:31] and uh and I believe that Satan would
[52:34] try in every way that he can to keep you
[52:36] from from actually believing that and
[52:39] and and making that yours
[52:41] um
[52:42] that's what he does condemns you
[52:45] and um but I mean Peter it says casting
[52:48] all your care about upon him all your
[52:50] cares upon Him for he careth for you and
[52:54] he is our father you know where it says
[52:56] in that um one place in the Bible um
[52:59] you know the Earthly Father the Son
[53:01] asked him will he not give it to him and
[53:03] how much more will our heavenly father
[53:06] and uh brother Branham says when the
[53:08] weakest Christian gets on his knees the
[53:09] Devils tremble and I believe that
[53:13] and just as I close
[53:15] um I just want to say let's let's have a
[53:19] positive confession but brother quidre
[53:22] said once that's not to have a negative
[53:23] confession
[53:25] come over our lips
[53:27] but you know the Bible says without
[53:29] faith it is impossible to please God
[53:32] um but faith is also a decision
[53:35] sometimes your mind can't put two and
[53:37] two together sometimes
[53:39] and you struggle to see it but if you
[53:41] decide I'm going to believe it anyway I
[53:43] decide to believe it now regardless of
[53:45] how I feel regardless of what I see
[53:47] regardless of what the situation looks
[53:49] like
[53:50] um I believe eventually it'll drop down
[53:52] to your heart and and and you'll really
[53:54] believe it
[53:56] and uh yeah he's the high priest of our
[53:59] confession
[54:00] so when we pray let's let's give them
[54:03] something to work with let's speak his
[54:05] word back to him and say Lord I take
[54:08] your word I thank you for this Victory I
[54:11] thank you for this thing that I've that
[54:12] I'm asking for
[54:14] and uh and I choose to believe your word
[54:17] concerning my situation rather than what
[54:20] I feel
[54:21] I mean
[54:23] is it possible for us to put the first
[54:25] those um the slides that was up
[54:27] pre-service with the pictures can we put
[54:30] them up I just um they just struck me
[54:31] and I just want to read them again
[54:35] yeah this is the first one pray without
[54:37] seizing and just the next one
[54:39] I don't know you probably all sort I
[54:42] don't know if everyone saw it but
[54:44] um
[54:45] anybody when mountains are moving
[54:48] and things anybody when mountains are
[54:50] moving and things can have faith but
[54:52] when things don't work out as you hoped
[54:54] that's when that's when you prove
[54:57] whether you've got faith or not amen and
[54:59] then just the next one
[55:02] stay with that word don't never leave
[55:04] the word you stay right with it you
[55:06] stand fast in the Liberty where Christ
[55:07] has made you free be not entangled in
[55:10] all those Yokes of bondage and so forth
[55:12] Stand Fast and stand free God will bless

[55:21] to come or yeah
[55:36] God bless you Maria thank you very much
[55:38] for that sermon

[55:41] weakest believer

[55:45] know that he's got our back

[59:12] Matthew 22 and we'll go to verse 37
[59:19] so Matthew 22 and verse 37 says
[59:24] and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[59:27] the Lord thy God before thy heart and
[59:30] with all thy soul
[59:31] and with all thy mind this is the first
[59:34] and great commandment and the second is

[1:00:13] first benefit that we have is eternal
[1:00:15] life you know granted eternal life you
[1:00:18] know this this world is not at home
[1:00:19] we're just passing through amen
[1:00:22] but I want to take the example of of
[1:00:24] Abraham you know the Lord
[1:00:26] um said to Abraham start walking you
[1:00:28] know and he told Abraham to you know
[1:00:30] just start traveling in Abrahams you
[1:00:32] know started walking and if we turn to
[1:00:35] um take our Bibles we'll go to Genesis
[1:00:38] chapter 22.
[1:00:47] and we'll go to verse 37
[1:00:54] oh sorry verse 17. it says here that in
[1:00:58] blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[1:01:00] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:01:03] the stars of heaven and as the sand
[1:01:06] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[1:01:09] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[1:01:11] amen that that's a man who walked with
[1:01:14] the Lord amen his seed will possess the
[1:01:16] gates of the enemy
[1:01:17] I mean they all have eternal life amen
[1:01:21] but I like to end and then I like to
[1:01:23] look take take Alex look at the Prodigal
[1:01:25] Son
[1:01:27] amen he you know his he he went out into
[1:01:29] the world and we all know what happened
[1:01:31] to him he lost everything amen so that's
[1:01:34] what happens when you you don't walk
[1:01:35] with the Lord I mean
[1:01:38] and you know I think of myself you know
[1:01:40] there was once more time I wasn't
[1:01:42] walking with the Lord
[1:01:43] wasn't serving the lord and I'm I devil
[1:01:46] was telling man you need to get a job I
[1:01:48] was like no Dad I'm hustling you know
[1:01:49] I'm trying to make money selling cars
[1:01:52] and stuff and I worked up heaps of money
[1:01:54] and I got this real nice it wasn't very
[1:01:56] nice but it was a van and they sold
[1:01:58] quite a lot of money
[1:01:59] and then it was Easter and you know day
[1:02:02] of Celebration I was driving down the
[1:02:04] road and this old lady fully crashed
[1:02:06] into me it was completely her fault
[1:02:07] wrote off my van so you know I lost I

[1:02:20] to someone it's a stodgy guy for not
[1:02:21] that much money and he didn't take it
[1:02:23] out of my name so I got all of these
[1:02:25] feeding fines which weren't mine but
[1:02:27] like you can't actually take them
[1:02:28] backside I'm just paying them off I mean
[1:02:32] but then I want to look here with all
[1:02:35] thy heart I mean so and and Matthew and
[1:02:37] Matthew 22 I'm just going to turn back
[1:02:39] there quickly
[1:02:44] and verse 37
[1:02:46] the Lord says and thou shalt love the
[1:02:48] Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:02:50] so your your heart I I I searched up

[1:03:02] you make all your choices from
[1:03:05] now if we go to Genesis 8
[1:03:07] and we'll go to verse 21.
[1:03:18] Genesis 8 21 it says
[1:03:20] and the Lord smelled a sweet saver and
[1:03:23] the Lord said in his heart
[1:03:26] I will not again curse the ground
[1:03:27] anymore for man's sake
[1:03:30] for the imagination of man's heart is
[1:03:32] evil from his youth neither again
[1:03:34] neither will I again Smite any more
[1:03:37] everything living as I have done amen so
[1:03:40] the Lord said down his heart amen and
[1:03:43] we have the fruits of that is that
[1:03:45] there's never been a greater flood like
[1:03:47] that amen the Lord kept his word
[1:03:50] amen even even myself when I was
[1:03:54] I was in the world I was trying to get
[1:03:56] you know hatched up being a gang and
[1:03:58] stuff and then the Lord told me you know
[1:03:59] if you surrender that I'll fill you with
[1:04:01] Holy Ghost and that night I made a
[1:04:03] heartfelt surrender amen I sincerely
[1:04:05] meant it and and you know the the fruits
[1:04:08] the fruits of my heart my heart felt
[1:04:11] surrenders you know I'm I'm not patched
[1:04:14] up you know I'm not out there doing that
[1:04:16] evil stuff amen so that's heartfelt you
[1:04:19] know that's strongly felt and sincere
[1:04:22] I mean
[1:04:23] now I want to talk about with all thy
[1:04:25] Soul amen
[1:04:27] so your soul is eternal your soul is
[1:04:29] more like your life amen your entire
[1:04:32] being that's that's your soul brother
[1:04:34] Branham says your soul is actually the
[1:04:36] nature of your spirit amen so everyone
[1:04:38] has a spirit but you know when you feel
[1:04:40] the Holy Ghost you get a nature change
[1:04:43] amen if you were predestinated no matter
[1:04:46] what you do the predestinated seed in
[1:04:48] you will germinate and come to life in
[1:04:51] the right season amen
[1:04:54] so that's your soul now I want to talk
[1:04:56] about your mind I mean so it says with
[1:04:59] all thy mind and that is your thoughts
[1:05:01] and understanding intellect
[1:05:04] here's the thing your mind can only
[1:05:06] think one thought at a time
[1:05:10] we have the power to choose what
[1:05:12] thoughts we think
[1:05:14] if you love the Lord with all thy mind
[1:05:16] you will think thoughts that the Lord
[1:05:19] wants you
[1:05:20] to think
[1:05:21] I mean and if we go two and two
[1:05:24] Philippians 4 8
[1:05:27] that shows us here the Lord chose on his
[1:05:30] word what thoughts he wants us to think
[1:05:50] so Philippians 4 8 it says finally
[1:05:53] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:05:55] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:05:58] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:06:01] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:06:04] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:06:07] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:06:10] any praise think on these things it
[1:06:13] means that's what the Lord wants us to
[1:06:14] think upon
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:20] amen I have a quote from Brother Branham
[1:06:22] he said this is talking about um
[1:06:25] um
[1:06:27] Balaam when he tried to go curse as well
[1:06:31] brother Brown says here the mule had
[1:06:33] more spiritual discernment than the man
[1:06:35] when he got his mind off God Amen so you
[1:06:38] know it's very important we need to you
[1:06:40] know keep our mind on Lord Jesus think
[1:06:42] thoughts he wants us I think
[1:06:44] I mean
[1:06:46] now I want to go here to
[1:06:48] um look on our neighbor amen so your
[1:06:53] neighbor is someone you have an
[1:06:55] association with amen
[1:06:57] someone around the world is your
[1:06:59] neighbor if you move next to him amen so
[1:07:02] in in a way of saying you know
[1:07:03] everyone's kind of your neighbor but
[1:07:05] you know mainly like the people that you
[1:07:07] associate who impact your life amen
[1:07:11] if we could go to um
[1:07:13] Matthew 5
[1:07:16] and versus 43
[1:07:18] first
[1:07:31] so Matthew 5 43 it says
[1:07:34] ye have heard that it hath been said
[1:07:37] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:07:39] thine enemy
[1:07:40] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:07:42] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:07:44] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:07:46] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:07:48] you amen so you
[1:07:50] pretty much treat everyone the same
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:55] and I have an example of you know what
[1:07:57] happens when you don't be nice to your
[1:07:58] neighbors so I used to live up in
[1:08:00] calcium
[1:08:01] I was flooding by myself and I was
[1:08:03] wasn't doing too good and I had I had
[1:08:06] flatmates which were you know they I
[1:08:07] live next to them so they had a big
[1:08:09] impact on my life
[1:08:10] and I was very mean to them you know I
[1:08:12] never did the dishes never once ever
[1:08:13] done I did the dishes I lived there for
[1:08:15] six months
[1:08:17] and um
[1:08:19] and anyways
[1:08:21] when I left they didn't pay my bond back
[1:08:23] so you know you have to be nice to your
[1:08:25] neighbors I mean
[1:08:31] now I want to talk about no um when it
[1:08:34] said it said
[1:08:36] um
[1:08:37] um
[1:08:38] it hangs on the law all these hang on
[1:08:41] hang on the law I want to talk about you
[1:08:43] know if you love Matthew 22 37 to 39 you
[1:08:48] won't have anything to worry about amen
[1:08:50] because that that's that's what the law
[1:08:52] was there for in those days you know is
[1:08:53] basically to you know
[1:08:56] um just to keep you safe and make sure
[1:08:58] that you got
[1:08:59] eternal life pretty much if you're a Jew
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:03] and if we could turn to um Leviticus 22
[1:09:05] verses 9.
[1:09:16] and Leviticus 22 verse 9 it says they
[1:09:19] shall therefore keep mine ordinance lest
[1:09:22] they bear sin for it and die thereof if
[1:09:25] they profane it I the Lord do sanctify
[1:09:28] them amen so that's that's that's pretty
[1:09:30] much it
[1:09:31] and you know we the it's the same thing
[1:09:34] in New Zealand you know we the the law
[1:09:35] here is to keep us safe and you know I
[1:09:38] used to always drive dangerously so the
[1:09:41] consequences was I got heaps of feeding
[1:09:43] fines and so you need to you know just
[1:09:46] butterflies like if I always thought you
[1:09:49] know the police the police here are
[1:09:50] awesome people you know I want to I just
[1:09:52] you know want to live a good life I
[1:09:54] wouldn't have anything to worry about
[1:09:56] I mean and we go for the for the um
[1:09:59] what's the profits when he says there
[1:10:02] and the prophets the prophets would say
[1:10:04] if you don't do this the Lord will be
[1:10:07] angry with you
[1:10:08] I mean if we could go to First Kings
[1:10:17] and we'll go first Kings 13 to 21 verses
[1:10:21] 21.
[1:10:37] so First Kings
[1:10:41] verses 21 to
[1:10:44] and he cried unto the man of God that
[1:10:47] came from Judah saying thus saith the
[1:10:49] Lord for as much as thou Hast disobeyed
[1:10:52] the mouth of the Lord and has not kept
[1:10:54] the Commandment which the Lord thy God
[1:10:57] commanded thee but camest back
[1:11:00] and has eaten bread and drunk water in
[1:11:03] the place of the which the Lord did say
[1:11:07] to thee eat no bread and drink no water
[1:11:09] thy carcass shall not come unto the
[1:11:12] separator of thy father's amen so this
[1:11:14] was a man who disobeyed no he didn't
[1:11:17] love the Lord with all his heart all his
[1:11:18] mind all his soul and this is what
[1:11:20] happened to him
[1:11:21] I mean I just want to take some examples
[1:11:23] from the Bible
[1:11:26] I want to look at Paul you know he um
[1:11:28] Paul was loving the wrong Lord
[1:11:30] and his energy was going into
[1:11:32] persecuting the right one I mean so Paul
[1:11:36] in his heart didn't love the Lord
[1:11:38] although he he he proclaimed that he did
[1:11:40] amen then on the road to Damascus Lord
[1:11:43] met him and you know the Lord changed
[1:11:46] his heart now he then loved the Lord
[1:11:48] with all his heart mind and soul and
[1:11:50] Paul is going to heaven amen Paul now
[1:11:52] his eternal life and if we can go to um
[1:11:55] Luke 18 verse 18.
[1:11:58] want to talk here about the Rich Young
[1:12:00] roller
[1:12:05] now this was a man
[1:12:09] who this is an example of someone who
[1:12:12] didn't want to love the Lord with all
[1:12:13] their heart mind and soul
[1:12:15] I mean so Luke 18 verses Luke chapter 18
[1:12:18] verses 18 it says
[1:12:22] and a certain role asked him saying good
[1:12:24] Master what shall I do to inherit
[1:12:27] eternal life
[1:12:28] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[1:12:31] me good none is good save one that is
[1:12:33] God thou knowest the Commandments do not
[1:12:37] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:12:40] do not be a false witness honor thy
[1:12:43] father and thy mother
[1:12:44] and he said all these have I kept from
[1:12:48] my youth up
[1:12:49] now when Jesus heard these things he
[1:12:51] said unto him yet let us thou one thing
[1:12:55] sell all that thou Hast and distribute
[1:12:58] unto the poor and thou shalt have
[1:13:00] treasure in heaven and come follow me
[1:13:02] now if someone really loved the Lord
[1:13:04] with all their heart they will do this
[1:13:05] instantly amen but this and go to verse
[1:13:09] 23 and when he heard this he was very
[1:13:11] sorrowful well he was very rich amen and
[1:13:14] then um there were later recordings of
[1:13:16] him and he was actually in Hell amen so
[1:13:19] unfortunately this this man's not going
[1:13:21] to burn the Lego fire amen so he must
[1:13:23] love the Lord with all your heart all
[1:13:24] your mind and all your soul amen
[1:13:28] amen I trust you're all truly blessed
[1:13:31] amen forgive you're coming up
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:50] amen thank you brother David
