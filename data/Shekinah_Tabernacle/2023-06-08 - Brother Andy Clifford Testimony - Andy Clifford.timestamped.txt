[0:00] anyway going through trials you know and
[0:03] the leaves of we we're in business with
[0:05] the leagues by the way
[0:06] um so we are going through the same
[0:07] trials but you see the the way that
[0:11] we're attacked can be slightly different
[0:12] right so
[0:15] um I want to share this for those of you
[0:18] because I know you know and I'm not
[0:20] getting I'm not going to go into a
[0:21] political subject or anything but
[0:24] um the anyone that's struggling with
[0:27] health issues from the vaccine
[0:29] so and you don't have to say who you are
[0:32] but there is lots of people that are
[0:34] struggling with um like heart conditions
[0:36] and all sorts of just health issues
[0:39] because as a result the side effects are
[0:40] they're listed on the vaccine site
[0:41] everything so anyway I'm not going to
[0:43] get into political stuff or whether
[0:45] you're anti or Pro or whatever but um I
[0:48] also actually had quite severe battles
[0:51] you know like real fight like real real
[0:53] strong demonic attacks but the Demonic
[0:57] attacks were kind of leaning on a
[1:00] physical thing that happened since I got
[1:02] the vaccine and that physical thing was
[1:05] actually
[1:06] um like my heart started just playing up
[1:08] never had any problems never had any
[1:11] nothing in my whole life and I've done
[1:14] Extreme Sports Extreme Fitness down to
[1:17] complete laziness
[1:18] and
[1:20] and as as relaxed as life can be right
[1:24] so I've done I've done the Spectrum and
[1:26] never in all my time have I had any
[1:29] issues with my heart right then I got
[1:32] this thinking vaccine which I hate
[1:34] vaccines by the way even though I want
[1:36] to tell you one thing just to balance
[1:37] this because I don't want to come across
[1:39] as a anti-vaxxer or someone that's
[1:41] extreme but the lord gave us a word
[1:44] about vaccinations and it was more for
[1:46] our children we were wondering should we
[1:47] get vac should we vaccine our children
[1:49] and you know you hear everything from
[1:51] it's demons going into you to it's good
[1:55] right and everyone has different views
[1:56] and but we prayed about it and the Lord
[1:58] said to us
[2:00] um but regardless if you vaccinate or
[2:02] not my blood covers you
[2:04] so have faith if you do it don't do it
[2:08] out of fear what if you don't do it
[2:11] don't do it out not do it out of fear
[2:13] because whatever that's the baddest
[2:15] Foundation right so anyway so I would
[2:19] have never got this vaccine because I'm
[2:21] not interested in injecting man-made
[2:23] stuff into my body I I already did that
[2:27] before I met the Lord right so I don't
[2:29] want to do it again
[2:31] we did a lot of bad things but I don't
[2:33] want to do it anymore and I just thought
[2:34] well but anyway I had businesses and
[2:36] Isaac and myself you know we we were
[2:38] like severely pressured by suppliers and
[2:41] by client big clients to to conform
[2:45] right to to do this vaccination thing
[2:47] and we had to get all our guys done and
[2:49] that was a mission in itself because we
[2:51] had the whole spectrum of ideologies in
[2:53] our business as well so not everyone
[2:55] wanted to do it anyway so we just I just
[2:59] went and did it anyway I was like oh
[3:00] well we'll just do it
[3:02] um and so I remembered that thing that
[3:05] the Lord said to us and I did it and the
[3:08] interesting thing was and I and I did it
[3:09] faith and all that and I but the
[3:12] interesting well the thing was yeah I
[3:14] just started getting these like sort of
[3:16] kind of like a heart
[3:17] it was weird just an irregularity or
[3:20] sometimes it was this funny feeling in
[3:21] my some sort of gland or something in my
[3:24] chest I didn't know what it was really
[3:25] uh it was just slightly uncomfortable
[3:27] and then
[3:29] um and then it kind of went ahead and
[3:30] think much about it I just thought oh
[3:32] well you know we're going into Rapture
[3:33] soon anyway so
[3:35] I'm not too worried actually and then
[3:38] about probably oh maybe about two months
[3:41] three or four months ago man this thing
[3:44] just really started ramping up you know
[3:47] and you start hearing stories of this
[3:48] one and that one and different pastors
[3:50] all around the world that are having
[3:52] heart attacks and things and you hear
[3:54] stuff just going on right and everyone
[3:56] hears it right none of us I'm sure we
[3:58] all hear these things so and and then
[4:01] one night I can't remember if it was at
[4:02] home yes it was at home so um I was at
[4:05] home and I was lying in bed and no no I
[4:08] was at my office before I went to bed
[4:09] and I was doing something in my office
[4:11] and
[4:13] now I'm having this conversation with
[4:15] some sort of spirit or whatever animals
[4:18] like and now I'm like thinking okay
[4:20] because now I'm getting these funny
[4:21] things and I'm having this conversation
[4:23] oh you know be so you know that this
[4:25] conversation was oh if I die
[4:28] because of what's going on in my chest
[4:31] it'll be so you know I'd really like to
[4:33] go to heaven
[4:34] but now I thought to myself ah but I
[4:36] really don't want to leave because we've
[4:38] got work to do right and we've got an
[4:39] Outreach and we've got family and I just
[4:43] couldn't bear the thought to leave my
[4:45] family right and I'm sure anyone in
[4:47] their right mind would be the same they
[4:48] just why would you want to Desert the
[4:50] battle right even though you're going to
[4:52] such a good place and whatever
[4:54] um and so I was like and then I kind of
[4:58] had you know sometimes you get caught in
[4:59] a conversation and maybe it's not the
[5:00] positive conversation so anyway it was a
[5:04] very reasonable conversation because my
[5:05] body was feeling the same thing right it
[5:07] was like I was like going through some
[5:09] physical anomalies that an anomaly is
[5:11] something that's not normal right so
[5:13] there was not normal things happening
[5:14] inside physically and you know now I was
[5:17] having this mental conversation and I
[5:19] was entertaining these thoughts anyway I
[5:21] got hop in bed and you know and I'm
[5:23] lying there and and I'm like the spirit
[5:27] man there was an atmosphere in the room
[5:28] it was negative it was dark and I
[5:31] thought wow it was about three o'clock
[5:33] in the morning something like that and
[5:35] this thing and and I'm I'm like whoa
[5:37] this is serious you know like this
[5:39] thing's trying to kill me you know and
[5:40] I'm having this conversation and I'm
[5:42] like whoa hold on a minute some sort of
[5:45] Revelation just came into the room like
[5:46] this is the Lord now comes down and says
[5:49] what are you doing entertaining this
[5:50] thought if you agree with this thought
[5:53] you will die
[5:55] and then it was like whoa this is how
[5:57] people die in the sleep
[5:59] the Devil Comes doesn't wear the who
[6:01] cares whether Christian or not Christian
[6:03] right the well we should care but I'm
[6:05] not meaning that way but the the Devil
[6:07] comes to human beings
[6:09] regardless of creed faith belief
[6:11] anything and kills them by fear by
[6:15] making them believe that they're going
[6:16] to die and their people can die of
[6:18] believing they're going to die right and
[6:19] so I'm like now getting this thing and
[6:22] I'm like whoa and oh but then and this
[6:25] is what I love you know that song that
[6:26] we sung today something about there's a
[6:28] lion inside my soul that's about to that
[6:30] was something like that happened to me
[6:32] we're in the in this moment that a lion
[6:34] came Hallelujah a lion of Faith just
[6:38] rose up within me and was like you
[6:40] stinking worthless devil what the heck
[6:43] are you doing and I just started
[6:45] rebuking the devil and I started casting
[6:47] him out of my room and and I and I
[6:49] thought you know what devil if you're
[6:50] coming like this to me I ain't gonna
[6:52] agree with nothing the Bible says no
[6:54] plague she'll come now my dwelling if I
[6:56] take any deadly thing that shall not
[6:59] harm me so I claim those things over my
[7:01] life and I rebuke the spirit of
[7:03] infirmity and I started I thought you
[7:05] know what I'm not going to let him off
[7:06] that easy so I started praying I started
[7:08] at the top of the country I was praying
[7:10] for brother Malcolm and all the ministry
[7:11] there I used to work my way right down
[7:13] the country brother Moses you are in
[7:15] that prayer brother Alpha all the
[7:17] ministers and everyone and everything I
[7:19] thought just I'm going to pray for
[7:20] everybody
[7:21] and I had to write Jubilee of a prayer
[7:23] meeting in my bed while I was lying
[7:25] there crying out to God and praying and
[7:27] I went right through the whole thing and
[7:29] problem rolls over and she's like
[7:31] and then she rolls back over and goes to
[7:33] sleep and then and then in the morning I
[7:35] said oh Brahman did you know what
[7:37] happened last night she goes oh there
[7:39] was an awful spirit in the room and I
[7:41] said did and she go and I go why didn't
[7:43] you pray with me she goes oh well I
[7:44] thought you were pregnant I just went
[7:46] back to sleep
[7:47] [Applause]
[7:49] what's up man I said we have fighting
[7:53] together
[7:54] and you know what that thing you know I
[7:57] had to fight that thing
[7:59] but I tell you what I want to encourage
[8:02] you because they're I'm not the only one
[8:04] right
[8:04] these things this is just man-made stuff
[8:07] it has side effects any medication has
[8:08] side effects it all does right and this
[8:10] is just part of it now you can either
[8:13] accept it or you can fight it now
[8:16] remember you've got authorities Sons and
[8:18] Daughters of God to fight any devil you
[8:22] will not be taken before your time you
[8:24] cannot be taken before your time you've
[8:26] got a story to finish and it's his story
[8:29] amen it's his story for your life if
[8:32] he's not finished with you it'll
[8:34] continue to write
[8:35] and it'll continue to fulfill and so
[8:38] have faith in God don't now when I say
[8:40] that the reason I say that is because
[8:42] that wasn't the end of it it wasn't the
[8:45] end of it so now I'm telling testimony
[8:47] of this thing I'm just on an individual
[8:48] level so I'm telling people and now I
[8:50] have to eat this testimony you know so
[8:52] I'm hoping I go to and now what happened
[8:54] was every time I would like go to bed I
[8:57] thought man do I have to go through this
[8:58] every time I go to bed now and I would
[9:00] you know because I'm a bit of a night
[9:02] owl it would be kind of about two
[9:04] o'clock in the morning one thirty two
[9:06] three ish somewhere around there I'd hop
[9:08] in bed and then the spirit would just
[9:10] come try and fight me I thought get out
[9:12] of here but I thought I had to fight
[9:14] this thing and I thought you know what
[9:15] because I said to that demon I said if
[9:17] you come back to me I'm going to you you
[9:19] are going to push the prayer button
[9:22] if you come back to you're going to push
[9:24] the prayer button and Revival is going
[9:26] to break out over this country
[9:28] because I'm gonna every time you come
[9:30] I'm praying for Revival I'm going to
[9:32] pray for all the ministers pastors
[9:34] congregations and until I feel like the
[9:36] spirit of law brings peace I'm going to
[9:38] keep praying I thought Lord don't put me
[9:40] through that because it's three o'clock
[9:42] I want to go to bed you know you've got
[9:44] to go to sleep a man does need sleep and
[9:46] so you know but you know what I was up
[9:48] at brother Malcolm's I shared this with
[9:49] brother Isaac and Mother Malcolm and and
[9:51] then I'm lying on that I thought it
[9:52] would never come back and I laid in that
[9:54] bed and that thing just went oh mate and
[9:57] I was in a I'm telling you it's very
[9:59] real when you're fighting this because
[10:01] that thing wants to kill you and I'm
[10:03] sure there's many people in here where
[10:05] the devil's tried to kill like literally
[10:07] like fight you and I had but the thing
[10:10] is he cannot stand the name of Jesus
[10:12] Christ he cannot stand when you are
[10:15] brave enough to stand up and fight or
[10:18] even sit up and fight
[10:19] but the word that comes out of your
[10:21] mouth is the son or daughter of God the
[10:23] name of Jesus Christ he has to Bow he
[10:26] has to flee and he's fleed and he cannot
[10:29] we cannot be defeated and so I just want
[10:32] to encourage you that we are fighting
[10:34] don't give up Don't Let The Devil have
[10:36] any ground in your life if he tries to
[10:38] attack you using vaccines using fear
[10:40] using this anything don't stand for him
[10:43] he's a defeated being and he cannot be
[10:46] defeated he can't sorry he cannot defeat
[10:48] the name of Jesus Christ and so just
[10:50] stand fast be strong be encouraged and
[10:54] if he comes to you let him push the
[10:56] prayer button for you
[10:58] maybe it's going to cause a nationwide
[11:00] International Revival fire burning you
[11:03] get attacked push the prayer button and
[11:05] you start praying and speaking and
[11:07] whatever the Lord wants to do in your
[11:08] life amen God bless you
[11:11] [Applause]
