[26:48] I mean praise the Lord I mean I'm amazed
[26:51] early that he loves me aren't you amazed
[26:53] amen isn't it wonderful I mean he first
[26:55] loved us amen praise the Lord I mean if
[26:58] you want to unmute yourselves you're
[27:00] you're welcome to do so but let's just
[27:02] stand together on this resurrection
[27:03] morning I mean let's read the scripture
[27:06] to
[27:06] I mean let's go to st. John and chapter
[27:10] one and we're gonna read the first three
[27:12] verses then we're going to read the
[27:14] verse fourteen I just want to go through
[27:17] I'd say quite a familiar piece of
[27:20] scripture with us but I probably would
[27:23] be a blessing a minute just so let's go
[27:25] to st. John chapter one and we're gonna
[27:28] read verses one down to three they're
[27:31] gonna read verse fourteen and then we're
[27:32] going to go to first John chapter four I
[27:35] mean so wave your hand or say Amen when
[27:38] you're there hmm
[27:39] amen was he good to see ones video and
[27:44] praise a little good to see your smiling
[27:45] faces and appreciate the songs brother
[27:48] Jeremy brother Peter David amen praise
[27:49] the Lord you know I'm yeah I'm I'm so
[27:52] thankful we can meet you know even it's
[27:54] this way you know the Lord is still God
[27:56] you know he comes and visits us in our
[27:58] houses you know we don't need to just go
[28:00] to church to experience his presence and
[28:02] for him to change and touch us but you
[28:04] know as we experienced on the weekend he
[28:05] can come into our address he can touch
[28:07] us where we are I mean so let's just be
[28:10] expecting for the Lord to move on our
[28:11] hearts today I mean let's go to so st.
[28:14] John and chapter 1 verse 1 it says in
[28:16] the beginning was the word and the Word
[28:19] was with God and the Word was God and
[28:21] the same was in the beginning with God
[28:24] and all things were made by him and
[28:27] without him was not anything made that
[28:29] was made this drop down to verse 14 and
[28:33] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[28:36] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[28:39] of the only begotten of the Father full
[28:42] of grace and truth
[28:45] amen a let's turn to first John chapter
[28:48] 4 and we're gonna read verses 1 down to
[28:58] verse 3 of 1st John chapter 4 I mean
[29:02] who's happy to be a believer this
[29:03] morning amen hallelujah the Lord made us
[29:08] believers a me unless it's got a first
[29:11] John and chapter 4 we read verses 1 1 2
[29:14] 3
[29:14] he says beloved believe not every
[29:20] but try the spirits we're there of God
[29:23] because many false prophets have gone
[29:25] out into the world but hereby hereby
[29:29] know ye the Spirit of God every spirit
[29:32] that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
[29:36] come in the flesh is of God and every
[29:39] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[29:41] Christ has come and that words those two
[29:44] words has come is very important and the
[29:46] flesh is not of God and this is that
[29:49] spirit of Antichrist whereof ye have
[29:52] heard that it should come and even even
[29:55] now already it is in the world let us
[29:59] read verse 4 as well ye are of God
[30:01] little children and have overcome them
[30:04] because greater is He that is in you
[30:06] than he that is in the world amen let's
[30:09] bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[30:11] Lord Jesus we truly are amazed that you
[30:13] love us I just asking father as your
[30:16] word has been read Lord we no man's
[30:18] words can fail but your word never fails
[30:19] I pray Lord you're an idea word Lord
[30:22] anoint speaker and hearer father once
[30:25] again
[30:25] Lord wherever we are Lord on this on
[30:28] this country Lord Lord in this country
[30:30] watching this or wherever Lord your
[30:32] believers our Lord I pray you would
[30:34] anoint him O God father may we recognize
[30:36] Lord whose in us father I pray you'd
[30:39] bless the word now their speaker and
[30:41] hearer Lord and we love you so much just
[30:43] want to commit the service into your
[30:44] hands in Jesus Christ's name have your
[30:46] way among us Lord may be so real today
[30:48] in our lives
[30:49] Lord in Jesus Christ then we ask amen
[30:52] amen god bless your friends you may you
[30:54] may have your seats so I want to if I
[30:57] could I you know I'd like to actually
[30:59] continue from what what brother John
[31:01] Andes was was was ministering
[31:03] you know over Easter time and the last
[31:05] service that he preached was was our
[31:08] eyes are open and it is Christ and if I
[31:11] could continue on from his thought I
[31:13] would like to speak about the one that
[31:15] is within us I mean so so I want to go
[31:19] and look at the spirit that the believer
[31:21] has has received you know this this Holy
[31:24] Ghost that we have received you know I
[31:25] you know this may be very elementary but
[31:28] you know if we could just recognize the
[31:30] one that's within us now I mean the one
[31:32] that said
[31:33] there'd be Sun Moon and stars and he
[31:35] believed his own word and there was some
[31:36] moon and stars the one who created all
[31:39] things is now within the believer so you
[31:42] know I wanted to read there from from
[31:44] first John four because notice it says
[31:47] that every spirit that confesseth that
[31:50] Jesus Christ that confesseth not that
[31:53] Jesus Christ is coming flesh so he's
[31:56] saying so it's not saying that every
[31:58] spirit that confesses that he has come
[32:00] as in past tense but every spirit that
[32:02] confesseth that he is come as of God so
[32:05] presently in flesh now amen that that
[32:09] spirit is of God but every spirit that
[32:11] says he had that that that yo he has not
[32:14] come presently is not of God I mean so
[32:17] it's very easy any devil can say yes God
[32:19] was manifested in Jesus Christ I mean
[32:22] the the prophet of Nazareth it's very
[32:25] every devil can say yes historically he
[32:27] was there I mean but but but the devil
[32:29] does not want you to recognize who's in
[32:31] you today
[32:33] remember the Holy Ghost is within us is
[32:35] not a lesser spirit it's not some other
[32:38] part of your you know it's not some
[32:40] lesser spirits not some religious bird
[32:42] but it's God Himself dwelling in the
[32:45] soul of the believer I mean says the
[32:46] very God who made all things is now on
[32:49] us I mean we we we need to recognize
[32:51] who's within us I mean because because
[32:53] we read there in the scripture greater
[32:54] is within you then he that's in the
[32:56] world so we need to see who's the one in
[32:58] us and then we know the one in the world
[33:00] is the devil I'm in that's very that's
[33:02] very straightforward Amen but we need to
[33:04] recognize the one that's dwelling in us
[33:06] now the one that has come in flesh now
[33:09] amen you know we read there and st. John
[33:12] that in the beginning was the word and
[33:14] the Word was with God and the Word was
[33:17] God and all things were made by him and
[33:20] then we went down to verse 14 and he
[33:22] became flesh and dwelt among us I'll say
[33:25] that same word that same logos that same
[33:27] Christ as in flesh today and the
[33:30] believer amen 2000 years ago but he's
[33:33] he's the same God in flesh today he's
[33:35] put on flesh in you hallelujah amen not
[33:38] just not just a prophet of God but he's
[33:41] now in his bride amen amen
[33:43] I mean because remember God changes his
[33:45] form but the
[33:46] same God has still failed behind that
[33:48] form so we know he was you know he
[33:51] appeared to to Abraham in many different
[33:53] forms but it was the same God all the
[33:55] time revealing himself I mean the same
[33:58] God that led Israel out of Egypt as a
[34:00] pillar of fire by night or a cloud by
[34:02] day I mean that that same that same God
[34:05] changed form and became a man as Jesus
[34:07] Christ now that same God is now in you
[34:10] and I hallelujah amen so you know it's
[34:15] season so many in this day I just
[34:19] there's just a statement I just wrote
[34:21] down many in this day have diminished
[34:23] the Holy Ghost as some basically
[34:26] helpless spirit that makes people feel a
[34:28] bit religious amen that will just make
[34:31] them go to church or quite some favorite
[34:33] bible scriptures and some kind of like a
[34:36] sympathetic kind of comforter that's
[34:38] just kind of there
[34:39] and it's different to the one that was
[34:41] in Jesus of Nazareth I say that is
[34:43] scripturally an era I mean because the
[34:45] same God that was in Jesus of Nazareth
[34:47] is the same God in you you need to
[34:49] recognize that God is and not just in
[34:51] heaven but he's in you hallelujah so you
[34:54] know but so they try and make it that
[34:56] it's a different spirit that were that
[34:58] was in Christ amen and what we've just
[35:01] read that means that is an antichrist
[35:02] spirit it's not just some feminine part
[35:05] of God or saying oh we are the feminine
[35:07] part of God but God is in bride form
[35:09] today so that same God that was in the
[35:11] groom is now on the bride having the
[35:14] same one that was in Christ the man is
[35:15] in you hallelujah
[35:17] you and I amen you know because it's
[35:20] season seek in Corinthians five and
[35:21] nineteen it says to wit that God was in
[35:24] Christ reconciling the world unto
[35:26] himself not imputing their trespasses
[35:28] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[35:30] word of reconciliation and so Paul him
[35:34] say we have received this Ministry of
[35:35] reconciliation so God was in Christ
[35:37] reconciling the world to himself and
[35:39] that same God is with Christ is anew
[35:44] I mean so it's not a different dog it's
[35:48] not a different but there's only one God
[35:50] he manifests himself in different ways
[35:51] but there's only one God hallelujah but
[35:54] you know it's the same God who's in
[35:55] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[35:57] isn't here
[35:58] hallelujah now it's like it's like I'm
[36:01] just going to try and do it experience
[36:02] it sees them yah yah it sees in the
[36:05] prophecy of Joel the Gurudwara spirit
[36:08] out upon all flesh the same God himself
[36:11] into his believers now you can take the
[36:15] same thing soso God God so God is
[36:18] changing his form so you say this is
[36:21] just say this is God right this is God
[36:24] right here this is just a very crude
[36:25] example now this is the believer now God
[36:29] said on the day of Pentecost he
[36:30] fulfilled the word that and and Peter
[36:33] Quadrant that he will pour his spirit
[36:35] out into all fish that he will empty
[36:37] himself so it's like now hope they don't
[36:39] make a big mess here but we'll see how
[36:40] this goes
[36:41] right so he said he will empty himself
[36:43] into the believer so so imagine this is
[36:45] you I mean the blood has cleansed you
[36:47] the Bloods washed you I mean you no
[36:49] longer in the muck of the world you been
[36:51] cleansed your already vessel then God
[36:52] empties himself into you hallelujah so
[36:56] so what was in God is now on you the
[36:59] same spirit God has now dwelling in you
[37:02] know God doesn't go empty I mean he
[37:05] doesn't get less I mean he's a an
[37:07] exhaustible fountain right but on the
[37:10] day of Pentecost he came along and
[37:11] poured himself into a hundred twenty
[37:13] open ready vessels
[37:15] I meant any still pouring himself out
[37:17] today would would would make a statement
[37:22] here if I can just find it he says it's
[37:26] likethey he sees and Susan the message
[37:29] Elijah in 1955 he says one thing to
[37:32] recognize the truth one thing to
[37:34] recognize the truth or to seal it
[37:36] forever when Jesus was here on earth did
[37:38] he claim to be a healer
[37:40] no sir he said I can't do any healing at
[37:42] all it's my father that does the healing
[37:44] that dwells in me is that right he said
[37:47] I as the son can do nothing what did he
[37:48] do he was possessed with the power of
[37:51] God without measure
[37:52] remember the scripture says that the
[37:53] fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in
[37:55] him
[37:56] we have it in measures he has it without
[37:58] measures just let you go out in the
[38:01] ocean and get a spoonful of the water
[38:03] it's just a spoonful out of the ocean
[38:05] that'll be just a little gift here up to
[38:08] the side of him so so compared to the
[38:10] whole ocean it's just a little spoonful
[38:12] but remember the same chemicals that
[38:14] send the spoonful of water is the same
[38:16] in the whole ocean see the same just
[38:18] small away smaller so so all the
[38:21] chemical properties of the ocean is in
[38:23] that spoonful right so I say all the
[38:25] properties of the Spirit of God are now
[38:27] within you I mean so all of my power is
[38:30] what's in you right I mean is within you
[38:33] Amen I like everything that God is he
[38:35] poured into Christ and all the Cross was
[38:37] he poured into you the church hallelujah
[38:42] so everything he is as in you right it
[38:45] made him an amnesia that was in him but
[38:47] the same same properties of the spirit
[38:49] cause it's exactly the same spirit is
[38:51] now in the believer
[38:52] amen amen
[38:56] now so so the Holy Ghost is not a Lisa
[39:01] spirt no as I said this may be very
[39:03] elementary but we shouldn't we should
[39:05] never diminish what's within us we need
[39:07] to recognize what's within us I mean so
[39:10] so so the so first John it's here that
[39:13] is coming flesh so every spirit that
[39:16] says he has come and is come presently

[39:26] Holy Ghost is not elissa spirit it's not

[40:09] everyone wants to be been received or
[40:12] wants to be received don't be a father
[40:15] unto you and you shall be my sons and
[40:17] daughters saith the Lord Almighty so of
[40:23] the believers the Temple of the Living
[40:25] God I mean that in order to be his
[40:27] dwelling place he has to dwell in us
[40:29] right yeah amen it can't just be yo we
[40:32] can't no one's a vacant temple of Nozawa
[40:34] I mean is either the Spirit of God or
[40:37] the spirit of the devil in us I mean we
[40:39] have people for something right but I
[40:42] trusted I believe that I'm looking at
[40:43] people who are the Temple of the Living
[40:45] God in this Alleluia God Himself is
[40:47] dwelling in us Halloween rings great now
[40:50] notice he says saith the Lord Almighty
[40:53] now when when Jesus begin to declare
[40:56] hers has her seven-pole you know you're
[40:59] you know I'm Jesus begin to declare his
[41:02] deity and and and who he was - John on
[41:04] the Isle of Patmos he would send
[41:06] revelations 1 and 8 I am Alpha and Omega
[41:09] the beginning and the ending saith the
[41:12] Lord which is which was which is to come
[41:15] the Almighty amen so the Lord Jesus
[41:18] Christ was clearing that he is supreme
[41:21] deity gave me remember this is not a
[41:23] lesser part of God I mean he is God my
[41:27] Lord Jesus is the Lord God Almighty I
[41:30] mean with him in glory there's only one
[41:33] Almighty amen is not Minnie almighty's
[41:35] this one God was manifested in the man
[41:38] Christ Jesus and then that body was
[41:40] glorified that was God manifested in the
[41:42] flesh
[41:43] I mean so that is God hallelujah it's
[41:46] not elicit God just like the Holy Ghost
[41:48] is oil-less of God it is there's only
[41:50] one God hallelujah and that same one
[41:52] that led Moses and Israel out of Egypt
[41:54] is the same God in you hallelujah yes I
[41:57] mean we're to recognize this he's just
[41:58] changed form I mean the physical form
[42:00] maybe might be different Amen he was in
[42:03] the pillar of fire who's in the
[42:04] Tabernacle in the wilderness he was in
[42:05] many different forms in the prophets but
[42:07] now he's in you hallelujah glory to God
[42:11] is what Easter should produce I mean
[42:13] this is what the crosses mean to produce
[42:14] that the blood of God would be shed upon
[42:16] the earth and it would cleanse the
[42:18] people that God can do well and those
[42:19] people once again
[42:21] hallelujah this is what this is our
[42:23] Easter amen our eyes have come open we
[42:26] see Christ and we see it's the same one
[42:28] that created all things is now in you
[42:29] and I are lujah amen to the so brother
[42:35] bran would say in the Patmos vision 1960
[42:38] he says the greatest of all revelations
[42:41] is the deity the supreme deity of our
[42:45] Lord Jesus Christ you can't get the
[42:47] first base until you believe that that's
[42:49] what Peter said repent and then see the
[42:51] deity be baptized the name of Jesus
[42:53] Christ for the remission of your sins
[42:55] and then you'll be ready to get in the
[42:57] spirit I mean the first thing you have
[42:59] to know is that the deity of Christ I am
[43:01] Alpha and Omega
[43:03] I'm from a deceit there's no more but me
[43:05] I was at the beginning I'll be at the
[43:07] end I'm he that was which is and shall
[43:09] come the Almighty think of it that's
[43:12] what the trumpet said I mean to the
[43:13] greatest of all revelations is the
[43:15] supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:17] he's not a Lisa God he's not another God
[43:20] He is God amen hallelujah this is what
[43:23] the bar is declares I mean you take all
[43:25] the way from Genesis down to Revelation
[43:26] as the manifestation or the unfolding of
[43:29] the same God hallelujah I mean so the
[43:32] Holy Ghost that's within us is not a
[43:34] little spirit ain't but as the spirit
[43:36] that was in Jesus Christ I mean God
[43:38] Himself I'm in a Matthew 28 from 18 down
[43:42] to 20 Jesus came and spake unto them
[43:44] saying all power is given unto me in
[43:46] heaven and on earth go ye therefore and
[43:48] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[43:50] name one name you will have the Father
[43:53] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost you
[43:56] know it's amazing how many people just
[43:57] just read straight over that and they
[43:59] just quote but then a prophet stood in
[44:01] this they said now what's the name is he
[44:04] a baptized in the name what's the name
[44:06] as father a name it's not a name it's
[44:09] another name it's not a name as the Holy
[44:11] Ghost a name no it's what it is I mean
[44:14] it's like me I'm a father I'm a son I'm
[44:17] a brother I'm a New Zealander I'm many
[44:19] things but my name is Benjamin John
[44:21] Gloin right so it's just like the Lord
[44:23] Jesus Christ when he said baptize in the
[44:25] one name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he
[44:28] didn't say baptize in the titles of God
[44:29] he said baptizing in in his name name
[44:33] and then Peter stood on the day of
[44:34] Pentecost the same God that spoke in
[44:36] Matthew 28 was now speaking in Acts
[44:37] chapter 2 and said repent and be
[44:40] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[44:42] the remission of sins I mean there's no
[44:43] contradiction the scripture is perfect
[44:45] Peter just gave the interpretation of
[44:47] what Jesus was saying that's right
[44:49] teaching them teaching them to observe
[44:52] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[44:54] you lo I am with you always even until
[44:58] the end of the world amen so God said
[45:00] I'll be with you I mean until the end of
[45:03] the world hallelujah so so if he
[45:05] promised you'd be with the believer he's
[45:06] still with the believer today
[45:08] you mean hey man we need to recognize
[45:10] the one that walked with us that's in us
[45:12] every day the one that we got asleep
[45:14] he's there in us when we wake up he's
[45:15] there in us hallelujah
[45:17] hey man glory to God you know we need to
[45:20] we need to recognize amen that that our
[45:22] Lord Jesus Christ is in us amen amen
[45:25] this now he would say in John 14 I hope
[45:28] you don't mind the reading but but but
[45:30] in John 14 from verse 16 to 21 and I
[45:34] will pray the father and he shall give
[45:37] you another comforter that he may abide
[45:38] with you forever
[45:40] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[45:42] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[45:45] neither Northam but you know him for he
[45:48] dwelleth with you and shall be in you so
[45:52] Jesus amen you know Jesus saying that
[45:54] the Spirit of Truth that you're gonna
[45:56] receive he's actually with you right now
[45:58] who was speaking to them he was the one
[46:01] yeah the Spirit of Truth is the Holy
[46:03] Ghost himself as a spirit he's saying
[46:06] the world cannot see him amen the world
[46:09] cannot see him but you could say well
[46:11] you know but but they saw the man of
[46:14] Galilee miracles he did but but they
[46:17] didn't see him they didn't see the
[46:19] father even the disciples are show-offs
[46:21] the father all suffice with us and Jesus
[46:24] said have I been so long with you and
[46:26] you don't know me he said if you can't
[46:29] believe me believe the works sake for
[46:31] they know he says it's not me to do it
[46:33] the works as the father that dwelleth in
[46:34] me do it the works Alleluia and I love
[46:37] it when he when he spoke to Mary at the
[46:39] tomb and and and and Mary didn't know
[46:42] who he was and and even
[46:44] even Mary would say to say to the Lord
[46:46] Jesus not knowing who was you know where
[46:48] have you carried his body that I make
[46:50] take him and carry him away and then
[46:52] jesus said to her Mary and her eyes came
[46:55] open but then he said to Mary don't
[46:59] touch me
[47:00] because I have an ascended yet would I
[47:02] go unto my god and your God and to my
[47:05] father and to your father I mean so he
[47:08] could say the same one that said you
[47:10] know it's not me to do it the works but
[47:11] the father that dwelleth in me has it
[47:13] you should be able to say the same thing
[47:15] this life I live has not me doing the
[47:17] work so it's not me living this life
[47:18] it's my father to me
[47:23] it's not a different one friends
[47:26] hallelujah it's the same God amen but
[47:31] see the center of the world cannot see
[47:34] him and they cannot receive him but
[47:36] those who are not of the world see him
[47:38] you know many times people wrestle mi of
[47:41] the world am I not of the world am I am
[47:43] a believer my not a believer well he's a
[47:45] good evidence do you see him in this day
[47:47] right healing and miracles but his word
[47:50] manifested today do you see it today do
[47:52] you see him today you've seen him today
[47:55] you're not of the world amen
[48:02] but ye know him so we're in still in
[48:05] verse 17 ye know him for he dwelleth
[48:11] with you and shall be in you speaking of
[48:13] the coming of the Holy Ghost he's gonna
[48:14] he's with you he's standing the Spirit
[48:16] of Truth is in me now Jesus saying I'm
[48:18] with you but I'm gonna be in you
[48:19] hallelujah amen
[48:23] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[48:28] come to you saying the spirit of truth
[48:31] is going to come it's actually me I'm
[48:33] going to come to you you know all in the
[48:35] world see if me no more but you see me
[48:38] because I live you shall live also and
[48:40] this is a day we say I mean Lord because
[48:42] you live I live also amen who's alive in
[48:45] Christ today a
[48:47] Amen at that day at that day winds that
[48:50] day when you receive the Holy Ghost when
[48:52] you become one with God at that day you
[48:54] shall know that I'm and my father you
[48:56] and me and I on you and he that hath my
[48:59] Commandments and keepeth them that is he
[49:01] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[49:03] shall be loved of my father and I will
[49:06] love him and will manifest myself I mean
[49:09] to him that beautiful I meant as I said
[49:14] in the beginning he is now veiled in his
[49:16] bride as he was on the day of Pentecost
[49:19] I mean we need to recognize remember
[49:21] this message is a restoration message
[49:23] amen before we are restored back as the
[49:26] church was before it fell I mean before
[49:28] the church age you know started I mean
[49:32] because remember the first complaint
[49:33] against the Ephesian Church age was I
[49:35] mean but thou art fallen amen rip yo you
[49:38] know you have left your first love that
[49:39] was the complaint so they lift up
[49:41] position and they begin to fall I mean
[49:44] but there was a space of time from
[49:45] Pentecostal that moment I mean where
[49:47] they had their first love and so now the
[49:50] ministry of of the spirit of Elijah is
[49:52] always a restoration ministry human you
[49:55] go back to the original when Elijah the
[49:57] spirit of Elijah was used the first time
[49:59] amen it says on Mount Carmel that Elijah
[50:02] rebuilt the altar of the Lord so it was
[50:04] there it was there but it had fallen
[50:06] into disrepair it had been neglected it
[50:08] wasn't being used anymore so but so he
[50:11] didn't come along and build another
[50:12] altar but he restored the altar that was
[50:14] already there you know he restored the
[50:17] correct approach back to God it's the
[50:19] same thing in this hour I mean the
[50:21] gospel we ever received is not another
[50:23] gospel it's not a different gospel it is
[50:25] it is the original gospel mm-hmm earlier
[50:28] but we have been restored back to the
[50:30] original gospel to restoration so that's
[50:35] why I can say on the day of Pentecost
[50:37] that was God coming and Brad form you
[50:41] see been restored it's now God and Brad
[50:44] for once again because we've been
[50:46] restored back to amen the original
[50:49] hallelujah amen I'm glad we're living in
[50:52] the book of Acts again aren't you not
[50:54] just watching it happen you're part of
[50:56] the fulfillment hallelujah humane amen
[50:59] he's gone that's right he brother bran
[51:02] would saying the mighty God unveiled
[51:04] before us but in the evening time it
[51:06] shall be light in the evening time and
[51:09] no scripture can be broken and the same
[51:11] I so in that poured himself out quino's
[51:15] on the day of Pentecost promised to do
[51:17] the same thing in the evening time it's
[51:19] according to the promise hallelujah and
[51:22] this is where we are amen hallelujah
[51:26] now the scripture tells us in Colossians
[51:28] 2:9 from him dwelleth all the fullness
[51:31] of the Godhead bodily omits all that God
[51:33] was was in Christ and then what all that
[51:36] Christ was is poured into the church
[51:37] amen
[51:39] now brother brown would say this is in
[51:43] 1949 and the deity of Jesus Christ I'm
[51:46] so glad this was laid out in the early
[51:47] part of his ministry he says the church
[51:49] has been brought from the cradle that's
[51:51] right Pentecostal rocked it down yonder
[51:53] a few years ago back there while the
[51:56] people throwed stones and made fun and
[51:57] laughed at but she grow to maturity now
[51:59] that's exactly right the errors here
[52:02] hallelujah that's right that's what I'm
[52:04] interested in to see God's church coming
[52:06] together now we've been beat out here
[52:08] beat out there but the hour is coming
[52:10] when God has thrown the blanket around
[52:12] us all to draw us in for the enemies at
[52:14] the gate hallelujah yes sir easy now of
[52:17] my people now of us people Daniel said
[52:19] the great things of the last days when
[52:21] these things come to pass my the great
[52:23] exploits will the people then the men of
[52:26] faith will do in that day and the hour
[52:29] has come now that when the great drama
[52:32] picture of God sets forth of the latter
[52:34] rain Joel said in the last days it shall
[52:37] come to pass I'll pour out my spirit
[52:38] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[52:41] daughters shall prophesy upon my
[52:43] handmaids and my maid servants will I
[52:44] pour out on my spirit and I'll show
[52:46] signs and the heaven above and signs in
[52:49] the earth below and pillars of smoke so
[52:52] our pillars of fire vapours of smoke it
[52:54] shall come to pass until the great
[52:56] terrible day of the Lord shall come that
[52:58] whosoever shall call upon them
[52:59] what shall be saved Jesus said in there
[53:02] these things that I do you shall do also
[53:04] and greater than this for I go unto my
[53:07] father hallelujah here is what is in
[53:10] there I mean the wood came back said if
[53:13] you abide in me and my word of God and
[53:14] you ask what you will and it shall be
[53:16] given unto you now we've got understand
[53:18] to a godless word as not to in our own
[53:20] human ability maintain keeping the word
[53:23] but here's his word right soso if his
[53:26] remember the word the logos became flesh
[53:28] a few so if you serve his word his
[53:31] presence his spirit abides in you I mean
[53:34] then ask what you will and it shall be
[53:36] done I mean we're gonna let our faith
[53:38] just just just take the brakes off let
[53:42] your faith just take control of your
[53:44] life who said God can't do Oh God that's
[53:51] not what I read in the scripture I mean
[53:52] he's still the same today I'm God
[53:54] doesn't work miracles person he doesn't
[53:56] work miracles in our homes anymore you
[54:07] know when we were watching the
[54:08] convention brother John Andes read that
[54:10] cried about the angel log passing
[54:12] through the neighborhood fulfilling his
[54:13] word and you've invited him into your
[54:15] house and then we had a glorious
[54:17] visitation once but many times I mean
[54:20] that same God came into our house I know
[54:23] we're in a convention someplace or just
[54:25] a church that same prisons that same God
[54:28] is with us here and we need to recognize
[54:30] him the same I may not just put a
[54:33] limitation all we need to go back to
[54:35] church and I'll feel the Prince of God
[54:37] the individual amen I'll be with you
[54:40] away I mean was here no but other people
[54:42] not was a group of young hallelujah
[54:45] right man he was with Daniel in the
[54:47] lines in a min we have to be the same
[54:56] way
[54:57] the god of Daniel the god of I meant
[55:00] Enoch as your God hallelujah amen
[55:04] brother bran would say and that say
[55:05] misses the deity of Jesus Christ that
[55:07] same power that same Christ hallelujah
[55:09] he says that the fundamentalist let them
[55:12] people who deny the power of God say
[55:14] it's wrong but the same power that spoke
[55:16] the world into existence is in those
[55:18] people that's got the Holy Ghost a lot
[55:20] of people with the Holy Ghost I mean
[55:22] that's right men and women it's time
[55:24] that we found out who we are
[55:26] find out and other side find out what
[55:28] we're packing man some little religious
[55:33] prayer make us quite a prophet and say

[59:17] brought down plagues everything other
[59:19] days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the
[59:21] mouths of lions decrease of violence of
[59:23] fire they escaped the edge of the sword
[59:25] they raised it from the grave cranks the
[1:00:01] results of faith we should have an
[1:00:05] atmosphere of unbelief I mean we should
[1:00:07] confess the right thing
[1:00:08] what we see around us I mean we should
[1:00:10] confess the right thing amen no brother
[1:00:16] Jordanna she was very outstanding this
[1:00:19] from your buddy the mighty God unveiled
[1:00:22] before us this is now I was brought in
[1:00:24] them face it was caught in a man and son
[1:00:27] Jesus Christ we believe that not just a
[1:00:30] prophet not just an ordinary man and not
[1:00:32] an ordinary human being who was in
[1:00:34] Christ the fullness of God in the
[1:00:45] Godhead bodily in his entire church
[1:00:48] manifesting himself fulfilling his word
[1:00:51] now we find out God all ages had had
[1:00:54] skin on it he God has been hid behind
[1:00:57] the veil so it's not just God and a man
[1:01:00] now it's God and men mean and I believe
[1:01:03] as I look through the gallery hello you

[1:01:07] in me and I see God in people I mean God
[1:01:10] is and his people once again this is
[1:01:12] what the cross was meant to achieve at
[1:01:15] least you got to recognize what God has
[1:01:17] done in my life is the achievement of
[1:01:18] Calvary hallelujah this is his purpose
[1:01:20] that's why he died on the cross not just
[1:01:22] that our sins would be forgiven only but
[1:01:24] then he would cleanse a people in dwell
[1:01:26] in them hallelujah benefices word
[1:01:29] through the ages to come hallelujah
[1:01:33] isn't why it had to be shepherds now
[1:01:36] notice he says as the father sent me so
[1:01:38] send I you
[1:01:39] I mean the father that sent him went in
[1:01:42] them to confirm the word the same Jesus
[1:01:44] that sends his people goes in the people
[1:01:47] that he sends hallelujah so we have been
[1:01:49] seed friends and the women commissioned
[1:01:51] by Almighty God go into all the world
[1:01:52] hallelujah and the God that sends you
[1:01:54] goes in you to fulfill his word Amen
[1:01:57] saying the works that I do shall you do
[1:02:00] also sure he prayed that that we might
[1:02:03] be one with him not with an organization
[1:02:05] not with a system but with one God for
[1:02:09] God in his word as one and Jesus and God
[1:02:13] was one and you and I and the word must
[1:02:16] be one I mean well how do you become one
[1:02:18] with the word the Holy Ghost that wrote
[1:02:20] the word comes in
[1:02:21] one man officious word out of your life
[1:02:23] hallelujah that's right we must be one
[1:02:26] in agreement with the word not with what
[1:02:29] somebody else is this is no private
[1:02:31] interpretation take it what it says and
[1:02:34] believe it and God will vindicate it and
[1:02:36] prove that it's right
[1:02:37] youth you think it's just for the
[1:02:39] disciples only take his word for it and
[1:02:42] try it once and see who's done that
[1:02:44] hallelujah amen and has it done what
[1:02:48] said it would do absolutely and if you
[1:02:52] get it before he'll do it again you'll
[1:02:57] find out that it'll work for you just
[1:02:59] the same as he promised yes sir
[1:03:02] I mean that's why you take you know yo
[1:03:04] you're the Apostle Peters prescription
[1:03:06] of the day of Pentecost repent be
[1:03:07] baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:09] remission soon and you shall receive the
[1:03:11] gift of the Holy Ghost we found out we
[1:03:12] received it I mean the spirt that worked
[1:03:15] they booked the entire Bible is now in
[1:03:17] the believer hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:03:21] mean so we have to come to a place and
[1:03:23] recognize a man as Jesus would stand
[1:03:25] there and say I'm my father or one right
[1:03:28] there was a oneness between him and the
[1:03:29] Father they weren't two separate beings
[1:03:31] they were one now many people in the
[1:03:33] state tried to make God into three
[1:03:34] different people but if you look into
[1:03:36] history you'll see that the that that
[1:03:39] that those church fathers that actually
[1:03:41] made the Trinity doctrine they were
[1:03:43] actually influenced by Plato's ideas now
[1:03:46] Plato was a philosopher who knows who
[1:03:48] Plato us who's heard who Plato is right
[1:03:50] so Plato believes that things were
[1:03:52] always constant they weren't but but the
[1:03:55] Jewish thought if you read through the
[1:03:57] autism as God was always unfolding or
[1:03:59] revealing himself but Plato's philosophy
[1:04:01] philosophy was no everything's just
[1:04:03] constant so they said well the fathers
[1:04:05] are constant the son is a constant the
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost is a constant it's not one
[1:04:09] god unfolding himself but three separate
[1:04:11] beings right right so but we can't think
[1:04:17] that way
[1:04:17] remember the greatest revelation is that
[1:04:20] Jesus Christ is supreme deity human I
[1:04:23] mean god unfolding himself right so we
[1:04:26] can't we can't have the thought that
[1:04:27] he's just yo dis that there's three
[1:04:30] people a minister's like Burrell Bram
[1:04:32] said you know one person came to him see
[1:04:35] no you know God is one like you and your
[1:04:37] wife or one but then bro man said real
[1:04:39] simply no but you've met me but you
[1:04:41] haven't met my wife but but Jesus said
[1:04:43] when you've seen me you've seen the
[1:04:44] father
[1:04:45] it's different kind of oneness see yes
[1:04:47] it's so simple but he says for God Jesus
[1:04:51] said I am the father or one we need to
[1:04:55] come to a place where we actually say
[1:04:57] Christ and I are one
[1:04:58] amen amen I ain't gotta be made one
[1:05:02] hallelujah I mean there's that me and
[1:05:05] him are one I mean by the blood of Jesus
[1:05:08] Christ I mean by what he did for me on
[1:05:10] Calvary he took away that that that gulf
[1:05:13] that sin created a wall of partition
[1:05:16] that we would be one hallelujah
[1:05:19] that's why Paul would say you know the
[1:05:21] great mystery of of marriage husband and
[1:05:24] wife they'll become one flesh he speak
[1:05:26] about Christ and the church
[1:05:29] amen amen
[1:05:31] brother I'm seizing this other seat is
[1:05:34] not here with the shook of 1965 but when
[1:05:36] you come to say I and my father are one
[1:05:39] and these other things then the shucks
[1:05:42] pulls away but the real genuine bride
[1:05:46] church will bring forth the entire Word
[1:05:47] of God in its fullness and in its
[1:05:49] strength he's the same yesterday today
[1:05:51] and forever that's why I pray God will
[1:05:56] just soso anchor into our souls the Holy
[1:05:58] Ghost we have is not a list of God it's
[1:06:00] not a different kind of God it's not
[1:06:02] just a religious spirit but it's the
[1:06:03] crater himself was now with me yes amen
[1:06:08] Jesus would say in John 14 believeth
[1:06:12] that I not believeth I'm not that I am
[1:06:14] and the father and the father and me the
[1:06:17] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[1:06:19] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:06:21] in me so I do yep but the father dwells
[1:06:25] in me he doeth the works right we have
[1:06:28] to what is the Holy Ghost as a spirit of
[1:06:30] the Father amen amen
[1:06:33] so the same spirit that Jesus said it's
[1:06:35] not me I'm just the man Jesus is the man
[1:06:38] of Galilee saying it's not me that do
[1:06:39] these works it's the father dwells in me
[1:06:41] dirt these works so as the father and
[1:06:43] I'm raised the dead
[1:06:44] healed the sick both
[1:06:46] pride the braid and the fishes I mean
[1:06:48] cold lasers from the grave the
[1:06:49] resurrection was there yeah that same
[1:06:52] one right he says it's not me to do it
[1:06:55] these works as the Father 12th enemy do
[1:06:57] it these works so we've got to say
[1:06:59] people may ask you how do you live this
[1:07:01] kind of life Hedy how these things done
[1:07:04] you say it's not me it's not me like I'm
[1:07:07] great something it's not me that that
[1:07:09] moves this kind of life as a spirit of
[1:07:10] the father's the Holy Ghost out of me
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:17] really really I sang to you he that
[1:07:19] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:07:22] shall he do also and greater than these
[1:07:25] shall he do because I go unto my father
[1:07:29] amen now we know it's not us trying to
[1:07:33] manufacture the supernatural you just
[1:07:36] say yielded and loved the Lord and when
[1:07:37] and and if he chooses to he'll anoint
[1:07:39] you to raise the dead he'll anoint you
[1:07:41] to cast the devil out remember we have
[1:07:45] standing orders mark 16 as the Standing
[1:07:47] Orders of every believer shall follow
[1:07:50] him believe it's not just the science
[1:07:52] here follow the ministry or these signs
[1:07:54] will follow the Apostles or these signs
[1:07:56] will follow the Prophet these signs
[1:07:58] shall follow them that believe I'm
[1:08:02] looking down you know Hawaii believers
[1:08:05] he he doing good mark 16 orders
[1:08:08] hallelujah Amen and you don't have to
[1:08:14] manufacture it just walk with God and
[1:08:16] you'll see him live I mean you'll see a
[1:08:18] trail behind you of God loving I'm in
[1:08:24] now brother Branham would say in the
[1:08:26] Pergamon church ages from the church age
[1:08:28] book he sees now then this word that he
[1:08:31] left behind on the printed pages as part
[1:08:35] of him when you accept it by faith into
[1:08:37] a spirit filled life he said that his
[1:08:41] word was life John 6:63 the be power
[1:08:44] verse but that is exactly what he is
[1:08:46] John 14:6 s I'm the way the truth and
[1:08:50] the life Romans 8 and 9 the be part if
[1:08:52] any man have not the Spirit of Christ
[1:08:54] he's none of hers there it is he is
[1:08:56] spirit and his life that is exactly what
[1:08:59] the world
[1:09:00] that's exactly what Jesus is he is the
[1:09:02] word so when a spirit born spirit filled
[1:09:06] man and faith takes that word into us
[1:09:08] heart and place it upon his lips why
[1:09:10] that is the same as deity speaking every
[1:09:13] mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[1:09:16] before that man it man I'm looking at
[1:09:20] these people guru I'm talking you know
[1:09:23] when I read this you say he's talking
[1:09:24] about me today you mean where the spirit
[1:09:27] filled this is you maybe you got to
[1:09:30] recognize he that greater is He that is
[1:09:32] in you that he sits in the world I mean
[1:09:35] when a spirit filled amen he says when a
[1:09:41] spirit born spirit filled man I say man
[1:09:44] or woman in faith that's why you got
[1:09:47] always believe the word never have a
[1:09:49] question never let the devil put a
[1:09:50] question on the word I can it still
[1:09:52] happen does he really do a supernatural
[1:09:54] healing does he heal does he really give
[1:09:56] the Holy Ghost the same get that out of
[1:09:58] your mind
[1:09:58] mm-hmm that's the devil trying to put
[1:10:01] doubt or unbelief into you I mean get
[1:10:03] rid of those thoughts right away I mean
[1:10:06] so you got to see a spiritual man and
[1:10:08] faith takes that word unto us heart and
[1:10:10] place it upon his lips that's the same
[1:10:12] as deity speaking every mountain has to
[1:10:14] go Satan cannot stand before that man in
[1:10:17] it now that's not us praying about what
[1:10:19] we want its yielding ourselves to the
[1:10:21] Spirit of God that God praise what he
[1:10:23] wants prayed recognize now how does God
[1:10:27] get a manifest his word upon this earth
[1:10:29] it's bright it's through his bride in
[1:10:31] the sour a mess not for some just some
[1:10:33] big ministry to do something that's for
[1:10:35] you the would have benefits through your
[1:10:40] life hallelujah if the church he says
[1:10:45] way back there in the Third Age had only
[1:10:49] held onto the revelation of the Living
[1:10:51] Word and the amidst the power of God
[1:10:52] would not have faded as it did in those
[1:10:54] dark ages and right today when the
[1:10:57] church returns to the word and faith we
[1:10:59] can say without a doubt that the glory
[1:11:01] of God and the wonderful acts of God
[1:11:03] will be in hermits again amen and they
[1:11:07] are the wonderful acts of God our
[1:11:10] endowments again we have returned to
[1:11:13] this is where we're
[1:11:14] arrive to a man I mean we're not looking
[1:11:15] for it to come it's already here yes
[1:11:18] hallelujah amen so just let faith have a
[1:11:21] perfect work in our lives hallelujah now
[1:11:26] I'm just going to read a bit more this
[1:11:29] is from the lady I see in church age
[1:11:32] where where it says revelations 3 it's
[1:11:35] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:11:38] that is who the Lord Jesus says he is
[1:11:41] but those words don't exactly mean as
[1:11:43] they sound to us just taking him the way
[1:11:46] they sound has made some people and he
[1:11:48] says in fact multitudes of people get
[1:11:50] the idea that Jesus was the first
[1:11:52] creation of God make him Lord and
[1:11:55] Godhead then this first creation crowded
[1:11:59] all the rest of the universe and
[1:12:00] whatsoever it contains but that is not
[1:12:02] right you know that doesn't line up with
[1:12:05] the rest of the Bible the words are he
[1:12:07] is the beginner or the author of the
[1:12:10] creation of God now we know for a surety
[1:12:13] that Jesus is God very God he's the
[1:12:16] crater john 1 and 3 says all things were
[1:12:19] made by him and without him was not
[1:12:21] anything made that was made
[1:12:23] he is the one of whom it said in Genesis
[1:12:25] 1:1 in the beginning God created the
[1:12:27] heaven and the earth also it says in
[1:12:30] Exodus 20 and 11 for in six days the
[1:12:32] Lord made heaven and earth and sea and
[1:12:35] all that in them is and rested the
[1:12:37] seventh day see there is no doubt that
[1:12:40] he is the creator he was the creator of
[1:12:43] a finished physical creation surely we
[1:12:46] can see that what these words mean now
[1:12:49] to have any other interpretation would
[1:12:52] mean that God created God how could God
[1:12:56] be created when he himself is the
[1:12:58] creator but now he is standing in the
[1:13:00] midst of the church as he is standing
[1:13:03] there revealing who he is in this last
[1:13:05] age he calls himself the author of the
[1:13:08] creation of God this is another creation
[1:13:12] this has to do with the church this is a
[1:13:16] special designation of himself he is the
[1:13:19] creator of that church the heavenly
[1:13:21] bridegroom created his own bride demon
[1:13:26] as the Spirit of God he came down and
[1:13:28] created and Virgin Mary the cells from
[1:13:31] which his body was born I want to repeat
[1:13:33] that he created the very cells in the
[1:13:35] womb of Mary for that body it was not
[1:13:39] enough for the Holy Spirit to simply
[1:13:40] give life to a human ovum supplied by
[1:13:43] Mary
[1:13:44] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:13:46] producing a body that would not have
[1:13:48] produced the last Adam FM Allah said lo
[1:13:52] a body hast thou father prepared for me
[1:13:55] God not Mary provided that body Mary was
[1:13:58] a human incubator and she carried the
[1:14:00] Holy child and brought him to birth that
[1:14:03] was a god man he was the son of God he
[1:14:06] was of the new creation man and guard
[1:14:09] meat and joined he was the first of this
[1:14:11] new race he is the head of this new race
[1:14:14] Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of
[1:14:16] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:14:19] the firstborn from the dead and in all
[1:14:21] things he might have the preeminence 2nd
[1:14:24] Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any
[1:14:27] man be in Christ he is a new creation
[1:14:29] old things have passed away behold all
[1:14:31] things are become new there you can see
[1:14:36] that through man was of the old old
[1:14:38] order of creation now in union with
[1:14:42] Christ he has become the new creation of
[1:14:44] God Ephesians 2 and 10 for we are his
[1:14:47] workmanship created in union with Christ
[1:14:50] Jesus unto good works Ephesians 4 and 24
[1:14:53] and that he put on the new man after
[1:14:56] words God is created and righteousness
[1:14:58] and true holiness this new creation is
[1:15:01] not the old creation made over alone
[1:15:04] hello hello hallelujah amen
[1:15:08] that it is not nor as it nor it could be
[1:15:12] called see this new creation is not the
[1:15:14] old creation made over or it could not
[1:15:16] be called a new creation this is exactly
[1:15:19] what it says it is a new creation
[1:15:21] it is not another creation I mean sorry
[1:15:24] it is another creation distinct from the
[1:15:26] old one no longer is he dealing by the
[1:15:29] ways of flesh that was how he dealt with
[1:15:32] Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's
[1:15:34] issue
[1:15:35] called the Isaac line but now out of
[1:15:37] every kindred tribe and nation he has
[1:15:40] purposed a new creation he is the first
[1:15:44] of that creation he was God created in
[1:15:47] the form of man now by his spirit he is
[1:15:49] creating many sons unto himself God that
[1:15:52] created creating himself a part of his
[1:15:54] creation this is the true revelation of
[1:15:57] God this was as purpose this purpose
[1:16:00] took form through election
[1:16:02] I read all that does it you can see
[1:16:04] we're not a patched-up creation I mean
[1:16:07] we're not just like a big open sore with
[1:16:09] a bandaid on us I mean but we are we
[1:16:12] have been made new again I mean all all
[1:16:15] things have passed away all things have
[1:16:17] become new I mean we are a new creation
[1:16:19] in Christ hallelujah amen amen so so
[1:16:23] Jesus was not elissa God God did not
[1:16:27] create God a me or create a God amen but
[1:16:32] Jesus was the author of the creation
[1:16:37] hallelujah even now there's one thing
[1:16:41] week now I'm just going to close with
[1:16:43] this thought it's the same God that
[1:16:46] conquered hell death and the grave isn't
[1:16:48] us I mean but nothing could stop him
[1:16:51] from Genesis all the way down through
[1:16:54] the book of Revelation I mean it is God
[1:16:57] being victorious
[1:16:58] all the way through it's not God being
[1:17:01] defeated even through the dark ages with
[1:17:04] the church had to die under persecution
[1:17:05] and then the other dark ages came that
[1:17:08] was not the church being defeated that
[1:17:10] was part of God's program admit and all
[1:17:14] the way even through the Dark Ages when
[1:17:15] there's just a very small bit of life
[1:17:17] they will still God's believers all the
[1:17:20] way down through those times nine
[1:17:22] hundred years God still had children and
[1:17:24] God still lived in a measure
[1:17:26] amen amen God being defeated there I
[1:17:29] made under under the Antichrist burn
[1:17:31] but it was actually all part of God's
[1:17:33] program and it's a now has been God
[1:17:35] victorious always remember he's the
[1:17:38] mighty Conqueror he's a man of war I
[1:17:41] mean he's a god of victory amen
[1:17:43] hallelujah so now remember Jesus we need
[1:17:49] died on Calvary me about this is
[1:17:50] actually a sign of victory can we see
[1:17:53] our hands maybe this is a sign of defeat
[1:17:57] but this is not a sign of defeat this is
[1:17:59] a sign of victory amen remember when the
[1:18:02] children of Israel were battling and God
[1:18:04] just said to Moses if you have your
[1:18:05] hands up one but as soon as they go down
[1:18:08] there begin to love Hey thanks he held
[1:18:12] Moses hands up and this was a sign of
[1:18:14] victory they raised they mean they were
[1:18:16] defeated without defeating a physical
[1:18:19] flow I mean in our conquering him and
[1:18:21] they win Samson Samson Kemeny and his
[1:18:25] eyes were out and he told the little boy
[1:18:26] when he came into the temple put my
[1:18:28] hands against the pillars hallelujah and
[1:18:31] they began to push I mean this is a sign
[1:18:34] of victory how they his hands a

[1:18:54] gazer on his shoulders his hands raised
[1:18:55] holding the gates and the gate couldn't
[1:18:58] hold me carried all the way up the hill
[1:18:59] that day only showing a physical gate
[1:19:02] couldn't hold him now that was just in
[1:19:03] the natural but in the supernatural in
[1:19:05] the son of gods hands were raised and
[1:19:08] they're pinned to the crust like this
[1:19:09] and we know they didn't need to be now
[1:19:10] that he would have held them they gladly
[1:19:12] I mean this was a sign of victory he
[1:19:14] wasn't just conquering your physical
[1:19:15] food but every enemy in Hell death and
[1:19:18] the grave Amen was conquered that day
[1:19:20] when his hands were raised and he won
[1:19:22] the greatest victory aiming for mankind
[1:19:24] ha Lisa wasn't a it wasn't a defeat it
[1:19:27] was a victory
[1:19:28] same thing when we raise our hands
[1:19:30] always said look take my life and make
[1:19:32] it mine it's a victory we're overcoming
[1:19:34] hallelujah we'll be victorious
[1:19:39] Laurie I mean to never think I you know
[1:19:42] this is victory right here lord I give
[1:19:45] up what I surrender the high to myself
[1:19:47] Lord I surrender that complex that pain
[1:19:49] that hurt hallelujah you're overcoming
[1:19:51] your victorious brother man would say
[1:19:56] and and I seed all that because remember
[1:19:59] he conquered hell death and the grave
[1:20:00] death could not hold him the grave
[1:20:03] couldn't keep him
[1:20:04] no devil could stop him hallelujah he
[1:20:07] conquered everything that could be
[1:20:09] conquered and he rose up triumphant now
[1:20:12] brother burns says in the message how
[1:20:14] can I overcome in 1963 he says overcome
[1:20:17] means to recognize the devil and every
[1:20:20] one of his tricks it means how you
[1:20:22] overcome amen to recognize the devil in
[1:20:26] every one of his tricks and that's why
[1:20:27] we have an eagle anointing in this hour
[1:20:29] and then we can see from eternity to
[1:20:31] eternity we can see what the devil is
[1:20:33] doing all the way through
[1:20:34] Amen that's why season you know Isaiah
[1:20:37] 14 yo it says that you're the devil he
[1:20:40] says I'll see myself on high but God
[1:20:42] says I'll bring you to the sides of the
[1:20:43] pit it says and they that see thee shall
[1:20:46] narrowly look upon me and say well
[1:20:47] sister man they did this week in the
[1:20:49] nations that says they that see him
[1:20:52] we've seen him in this day right
[1:20:54] hallelujah is this really the guy that
[1:20:56] did all this I mean so as to recognize
[1:21:00] the devil in every one of his tricks
[1:21:02] lots of people say there is no devil
[1:21:04] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:21:06] that I mean there's a real devil he's
[1:21:09] just as real as you are or anybody a
[1:21:12] real devil you must recognize him real
[1:21:14] you must know he's a devil then the same
[1:21:17] time that you recognize him and know
[1:21:19] that he's a devil and he's against you
[1:21:21] then to overcome you must recognize that
[1:21:25] so there's our overcome one step to
[1:21:28] overcoming not seven or five one you
[1:21:32] must recognize that the God that's in
[1:21:35] you is greater and mightier than here's
[1:21:38] the one that's in you has all ready
[1:21:41] let's say already already overcome him I
[1:21:46] mean it says not all these a big
[1:21:49] contest and maybe let's say you have God
[1:21:50] and Satan or God or Satan will win oh
[1:21:52] god dirty overcome him he has already
[1:21:57] overcome him and by His grace you know
[1:22:00] more than a match for him
[1:22:02] amen there's real overcoming when you
[1:22:05] recognize you look back saying I'm doing
[1:22:09] this and I'm doing that see people
[1:22:10] always look at their performance I'm
[1:22:12] praying enough I'm reading enough I'm
[1:22:15] dressing extra whatever and you know I'm
[1:22:17] quoting enough and I'm doing all these
[1:22:20] things you look back in time doing this
[1:22:22] and I'm doing that we're not then you're
[1:22:25] defeated I mean when you run you can't
[1:22:30] overcome a supernatural devil by natural
[1:22:33] works don't I mean how can you overcome
[1:22:36] a supernatural devil by your natural
[1:22:38] works of your flesh
[1:22:39] can do that the other way you can
[1:22:40] overcome the devil is by supernatural
[1:22:42] faith that's in you mmm amen so he says
[1:22:47] when you do it well I'm doing this and
[1:22:49] I'm doing that then you're defeated but
[1:22:52] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:22:53] are in Christ Jesus that walk not after
[1:22:55] the flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:22:58] realize that you've overcome hallelujah
