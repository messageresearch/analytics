[0:28] Heat.
[0:32] Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
[3:20] Thank you.
[6:21] Good morning. God bless you all.
[6:25] How's your life?
[6:28] Good.
[6:33] Life is such a wonderful thing. There
[6:34] are so many little twists and turns and
[6:37] ups and downs and things.
[6:40] And you know, it's nice to know that
[6:43] that
[6:46] things come and things go. Phases come,
[6:49] phases go. Different situations happen.
[6:52] They're here. They're not there. But the
[6:55] word of God and the promises of God are
[6:58] eternal. And they they run through all
[7:00] of it.
[7:01] They run through every high. They run
[7:03] through every low, every this phase,
[7:05] every that phase, every this situation,
[7:07] every that situation. It just runs
[7:10] through it all. I believe there's a song
[7:12] that says, "Hold to God's unchanging
[7:14] hand." And that's that's the hand that
[7:16] we can hold to. Why don't we actually
[7:18] let's stand this morning. Why don't we
[7:19] sing that song? Let's let's change it.

[7:26] morning. Heavenly Father, we're grateful

[7:40] we receive it as from you. We thank you
[7:43] for this holiday season, Lord, that we
[7:44] can um take a break and and slow down.
[7:47] And often times, Lord, as Christians,
[7:49] the the the thing that our mind does
[7:50] when we start to get some time to stop
[7:53] us. We always think about the things of
[7:55] you and we tend to meditate upon you
[7:57] more, Lord, because inside us, that's
[7:58] what we want. So, we just want to Yeah.
[8:00] Just pray you bless this um service this
[8:01] morning in Jesus wonderful name. Amen.

[26:21] could not keep him from rising again.

[28:44] Oh glorious day.
[28:48] Oh, glorious day.
[28:59] And who taught the sun where to stand in
[29:04] the morning?
[29:07] And who told the ocean, "You can only
[29:11] come this far?"
[29:15] And who showed the moon
[29:20] where to hide till evening?

[34:41] year, haven't we? God's been good. Amen.
[34:43] Let's um let's turn to the scripture
[34:45] this morning. We're just going to go to
[34:46] Matthew um we're going to go to Matthew
[34:50] uh 24. We're going to read from verse uh
[34:53] 35 here. So I take a while to orientate
[34:56] myself here this morning, but Amen.
[35:01] Good to see your smiling faces.
[35:05] Amen. Who ate a bit too much over
[35:07] Christmas?
[35:13] Amen. Matthew 24:35 says here, "Heaven
[35:16] and earth shall pass away, but my words
[35:19] shall not pass away." And then just
[35:22] another scripture from uh Mark 7 and 13.
[35:25] You don't need to turn to it
[35:27] necessarily. I can just read it here.
[35:28] But um Jesus rebuking the scribes and
[35:32] Pharisees. He says, "Making the word of
[35:33] God of none effect through your
[35:34] tradition which you have delivered and
[35:37] many such thing uh like things do ye."
[35:40] And um I just want to talk about I I
[35:43] just pray this would be I just pray the
[35:44] Lord bring this together. But I want to
[35:45] ask the question, you know, because many
[35:47] people they they they use the excuse of
[35:49] what man has done with God's word,
[35:51] &gt;&gt; but what has God done with his word?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to talk about this
[35:55] morning. Amen. So as as we've read his
[35:57] word, let's just bow our heads in a word
[35:58] of prayer. If you want to be remembered
[35:59] in prayer, just want to slip your hand
[36:00] up. Say, "Lord, this day come by my
[36:03] way." Amen. Let's pray together.
[36:05] Gracious father, we want to thank you so
[36:07] much. We can gather one more time, Lord,
[36:08] as we uh closing out 2025. I just pray
[36:12] you come by one more time. Touch our
[36:14] lives. Touch my life. Lord, we know you
[36:16] live. Lord, you're the same yesterday,
[36:18] today, and forever. So, dear God, as
[36:20] we've read your blessed word, I ask may
[36:22] you anoint it to speaker and hearer.
[36:24] those who are streaming as well be your
[36:26] Lord be our portion this day. We love
[36:28] you so much. We commit our lives into
[36:30] your hands. Just want to plead your
[36:32] blood over our lives, dear God. Protect
[36:34] us under the shadow of your great wings.
[36:35] And may you have your preeminence, Lord.
[36:37] Do what you want to do in this service
[36:39] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[36:42] bless you friends. You can have your
[36:43] seats this morning. So I just want to
[36:46] pose this question. Oh wait, I'm going
[36:48] here as well. I mean so many people as
[36:51] as as we know that man has done a lot of
[36:54] things with God's word but what has God
[36:56] done with his word because if we can
[36:57] look at what God has done I think we can
[36:59] just line ourselves up with that and we
[37:02] can just walk with him and just have a
[37:03] victorious uh life. Amen. I believe I'm
[37:06] looking at people who are victorious.
[37:08] But you know I think a lot of things
[37:10] especially in this day and there was a
[37:12] lot of you know there's a um there's a
[37:14] saying that the devil puts up a lot of
[37:16] scarecrows. He takes something that's,
[37:18] you know, like a scarecrow is just to
[37:20] chase away birds from from harvests from
[37:22] from crops that they don't get the
[37:24] crops. But, you know, a scarecrow is
[37:26] just a lifeless dead form. It has no
[37:28] power in it. It has no reality. Look,
[37:30] that thing's really been crucified up
[37:32] there. It can't chase you. It can't
[37:33] move. But that's what that's what the
[37:35] devil puts these scarecrows forward to
[37:37] try and stop people getting to where the
[37:39] good eating's at. Amen. Like brother
[37:40] Bram would say about a little gopher or
[37:42] groundhog, whatever it was. You know,
[37:44] brother Ram said, you know, I'm a real
[37:45] artist. And he noticed this groundhog
[37:47] was getting into his crops and stuff.
[37:49] And so he got a brown paper bag and drew
[37:51] something on it to try and make a little
[37:52] scarecrow and put it there about
[37:54] groundhog height to stop him stop him
[37:56] getting there. Then the groundhog came
[37:57] out, got a little bit scared and then
[37:59] looked at the thing. It just moved a
[38:00] bit. He jumped back and then he even
[38:02] ported it a bit, realized that thing's
[38:04] dead. He just ran around past it, you
[38:06] know, got eating butter beans and
[38:07] filling his tummy full. And you know, so
[38:09] we got to go beyond what people have
[38:10] done with the word and see what what has
[38:12] God done with his word. Amen. Cuz a lot
[38:14] of things are just scarecrows. And as we
[38:17] say, well, there's a saying, you know,
[38:18] you don't throw out the baby with the
[38:20] bath water, right? So just because other
[38:22] people have done things with the word
[38:23] doesn't mean we throw it out, right? For
[38:26] example, amen. We're going to take
[38:27] communion, you know, over, you know,
[38:29] just as we pray in the new year. You
[38:30] know, the Catholics have made it into
[38:32] that literally becomes the body of our
[38:34] of our Lord Jesus. Amen. Well, if it is
[38:36] that, therefore, he's physically
[38:38] returned. That's what they've done with
[38:39] it. That doesn't mean we throw out
[38:41] communion cuz it's the word, right?
[38:43] Amen. Same thing with our, you know, we
[38:45] celebrate Christmas. We celebrate the
[38:46] birth of our Lord. And, you know, the
[38:48] Catholics and many different
[38:50] denominations have done a lot of things
[38:51] with with that. We don't throw Mary out
[38:53] of the scripture. We don't throw the,
[38:55] you know, the God being created in her
[38:57] womb out of the scripture just because
[38:58] of what they've done with it. It's just
[39:00] scarecrows. You know, it's the same
[39:02] thing with people will take many
[39:03] different things in the scripture.
[39:05] They'll say, "Oh, you know, they've made
[39:06] this out of it." And you know, like, for
[39:08] example, people say, "Well, you know,
[39:09] Brother Bram said, you got to receive
[39:10] the word for your day." You know, people
[39:13] people will take that and say, "Well,
[39:14] that's the sign. You got the Holy Ghost.
[39:16] You just got to receive the word. It's
[39:17] just a mental conception." And then
[39:19] people will throw that out. Say, "Well,
[39:20] there's nothing to it cuz it's just a
[39:22] mental understanding." We don't throw
[39:23] that out. You've got to receive the word
[39:24] because the word is Jesus Christ. I
[39:26] mean, you got to receive him in your
[39:27] day. Amen. So, you know, people have
[39:29] done a lot of things with the word, but
[39:31] what has God done with his word? I'm
[39:33] just wanting to quickly go over these
[39:35] things because
[39:37] what he has done with his word really
[39:39] matters and that's what I want to look
[39:41] at. So, we're not interested necessarily
[39:43] in what other people have done. It
[39:45] really doesn't matter what they do. If
[39:47] God's word is his word, which it is,
[39:49] it's been revealed to our hearts. Let's
[39:50] stay with his word and let's watch him
[39:52] do what he wants to do with that word.
[39:54] Amen. So, you know, cuz it's incredible.
[39:56] You think about, well, what did God do
[39:58] with his word in the beginning? He
[39:59] believed his word when he said, "Let
[40:01] there be sun, moon, and stars." and he
[40:03] believed his word and he made creation.
[40:06] That's what he did with his word. He
[40:07] believed it and it came to pass exactly
[40:09] as he spoke it. And if we believe it as
[40:11] he said it, it's going to manifest as
[40:13] he's proven, you know, said it will.
[40:15] Amen. You know, he you know, he proved
[40:16] his word there in there in um there in
[40:20] Egypt, you know, when when he told
[40:21] Moses, take a lamb for the house, you
[40:23] know, apply, you know, kill that lamb,
[40:25] roast it with bitter herbs, eat the
[40:27] whole thing, you know, apply the blood
[40:29] to the door and lentil. So that word
[40:31] became material and he proved that word.
[40:33] So the believers when they lined up with
[40:35] the word what the word was meant to do
[40:37] happened. What happened? That literally
[40:38] kept the death angel from their house.
[40:40] They were safe and secure. Nothing could
[40:42] get in between because the blood was
[40:44] between them and the enemy, right? And
[40:46] so it's the same thing today. If we just
[40:48] take God at his word because you got to
[40:50] think about, you know, God's creative
[40:52] power is in his word. I mean, when God
[40:54] releases a faith into your life, amen,
[40:57] what is he wanting to do? He's wanting
[40:58] to prove his word through you. Amen.
[41:00] He's not He's not wanting to give you a
[41:03] mind of good understanding or good
[41:05] ideas. No, he wants it to become
[41:06] material. He wants it to become
[41:08] manifest. Amen. He doesn't just want us
[41:10] to talk about it. He wants it to live.
[41:12] Amen. And I believe that God has so
[41:15] restored his word back in this day that
[41:17] we're not looking for a full
[41:18] restoration. We're living in that
[41:20] restoration. Amen. So when we look at
[41:22] the day of Pentecost, see many people
[41:23] always they want to try and bypass the
[41:25] new birth with some excuse to try and
[41:27] hide behind some hypocrite. Who cares
[41:29] about the hypocrite? The hypocrite's not
[41:31] me. The hypocrite's not you. Who cares
[41:33] about them? It's us and God. That's all
[41:35] that matters. Amen. So, you know, it's
[41:38] we must never ever um try and get rid of
[41:42] or try and try and throw away the word
[41:44] just because of what other people have
[41:46] done.
[41:48] You know, there's prevailing power in
[41:50] the word.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Revelation has prevailing power. You
[41:53] know, our Lord Jesus Christ, he had one
[41:55] one scripture he went to Calvary with
[41:57] that he knew he wouldn't stay dead in
[41:58] the tomb. And this was it. For thou
[42:00] shalt not suff leave my soul in hell,
[42:02] neither will thou suffer the holy one to
[42:04] see corruption. He knew he had to go to
[42:06] hell with the sins of the world upon
[42:08] him. Right? He knew he had to die a
[42:09] sinner, die lost. Amen. So, he knew he
[42:12] was going to hell, but he had a
[42:13] revelation. I'm not staying there.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and he went to he went to the
[42:17] grave with one scripture but because it
[42:20] was a revelation. Amen. That revelation
[42:22] overcame hell, death in the grave. And
[42:24] he came out resurrected triumphant over
[42:26] hell, death in the grave because of one
[42:28] scripture was revealed to him. Amen. I
[42:31] tell you what, friends, if we could just
[42:33] focus on the promises of God and let God
[42:35] reveal his promises to us. Amen. There's
[42:38] nothing that can stand before you.
[42:40] Unbelief can't stand before you. Amen.
[42:42] Amen. Superstition can't stand before
[42:44] you. culture can't stand before you.
[42:46] Your own human nature can't stand before
[42:48] you. If you just focus on the word of
[42:50] God and let him manifest it in your
[42:52] life. Amen. There's prevailing power.
[42:54] Amen. If a revelation can take a can
[42:57] take a Lord Jesus out of the grave, the
[42:59] the re the rapture is a revelation as
[43:01] well. Amen. Brother Ram said, "We're
[43:03] waiting for the revelation of the
[43:04] rapture." He gives it in the rapture
[43:06] message, but that message has to become
[43:08] a revelation to you.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've heard the shout.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; I've been gathered. Amen. That shout has
[43:14] produced a living bread to bring forth a
[43:16] living bride. That's what it's done in
[43:18] my life. Amen. It's produced what it
[43:20] said it would produce. Amen. Cuz this is
[43:23] what God has done with his word. Amen.
[43:24] He's taken a bunch of alley rats. He's
[43:27] taken a bunch of drunks. He's taken a
[43:28] bunch of lost wayward religious people
[43:30] thinking they're something and he's
[43:32] transformed them into sons and daughters
[43:34] of God. Amen. He's brought out what they
[43:36] were in the beginning in his mind. He's
[43:38] produced it in time.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Why? Because God
[43:43] interprets his word when he manifests
[43:44] it. Amen. You look at what has God done
[43:47] with his word. God has not doubted his
[43:49] word. God has not embellished his word.
[43:51] God has not tried to make it some great
[43:53] thing that above what it really is. What
[43:55] it is, it is. Amen. It's not polished
[43:58] up. It's just how it is. It is. Amen. So
[44:00] when he said a virgin shall conceive,
[44:02] that really happened exactly as he said
[44:04] it would happen. Amen. And when we take
[44:06] any promise of God, Amen. you'll see it
[44:09] in faith. You'll see it produce what
[44:10] it'll produce. Oh, but I know some
[44:13] people who believe these things. Who
[44:14] cares about what other people believe?
[44:16] Honestly, it's you and God. Enoch would
[44:18] have heard a lot of nonsense when he was
[44:20] walking around, but he walked with God.
[44:22] Amen. And that's what we are actually
[44:23] ordained to do. Don't worry about the
[44:25] world does. It's you and God.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; It's me and Jesus in this ship, but I'm
[44:29] going to Zion, right? Amen. So, this is
[44:31] how we should be. Don't worry about what
[44:33] other people do. Amen. Even even John
[44:36] would um Peter would ask about John if I
[44:39] can find it here. You know Peter's
[44:41] asking about the love disciple and
[44:43] you're asking about John and things but
[44:45] Jesus said but if he will that he tries
[44:49] till I come what is it to thee? Follow
[44:51] thou me?
[44:53] &gt;&gt; What what if he sees me return? What's
[44:54] it to you? Follow me.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; You know so who cares about what other
[44:58] people are doing? Follow the Lord. And I
[45:00] think especially in this season where
[45:02] we've just come through Christmas and
[45:04] the world has made it something that it
[45:06] was never ordained to be and you know
[45:07] let's just keep following the Lord when
[45:09] people are caught up in life and all
[45:12] these things. Let's just follow the
[45:13] word.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; But you see what happens is
[45:23] we must never ever try and hide
[45:26] behind
[45:28] what others have done.
[45:30] See, the devil will always point you to
[45:32] somebody's failure.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; That's what he does. He's very good at
[45:36] it.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; He knows all the failures. He keeps it
[45:38] on a file. In God's file, it's not
[45:41] there. It's under the blood of it's been
[45:42] confessed. So, in God's in the proper
[45:45] archive, it's gone. You never did it in
[45:47] the first place. But the devil tries to
[45:49] keep things recorded. And he'll always
[45:50] point out someone else's failure to you.
[45:52] Amen. But he tries but he tries to keep
[45:55] you away from the real testimony that's
[45:57] genuine. Amen. He'll never point you out
[45:59] to a real sainted overcomer.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll always try and kill the
[46:04] testimony of the believer, but it it it
[46:07] actually doesn't kill the testimony. I
[46:08] mean, testimony still lives. Amen. But
[46:11] he'll point you to a hypocrite sometime
[46:13] who went out impersonating something. He
[46:15] didn't do it because he was
[46:16] impersonating. But if it come from a
[46:18] true source of the word of God, heavens
[46:20] and earth will pass away, but my word
[46:22] cannot pass away. It's got to stay
[46:24] there. He says, you see, it's sis. Amen.
[46:27] It must be accepted in the mind. So
[46:28] don't go looking at what other people
[46:29] have done. When it's believed with the
[46:32] heart, then the word of God becomes a
[46:34] reality. When every sense of soul and
[46:36] body is just scout out with the Holy
[46:38] Spirit, then your sense of God, your
[46:40] conscious of God, everything that's
[46:41] godly flows through you. There's not a
[46:43] doubt anywhere. There's nothing can rise
[46:45] up. There's nothing can come up in the
[46:46] memory and say, "Well, I remember Miss
[46:48] Miss Jones tried to trust God and Miss
[46:50] so and so and Miss Doe tried to trust
[46:52] God for healing one time. She failed."
[46:54] But if that channel has been cleared out
[46:56] and been purged and been filled on the
[46:58] inside with the Holy Spirit that don't
[47:00] even come into the memory, no matter
[47:02] about Miss Jones and what she did, it's
[47:04] you and God together and nobody else but
[47:07] you two.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; So it's not about what others have done
[47:10] and God and even how God has led other
[47:13] people. It's not about that. It's you
[47:14] and God. I mean th that that's all that
[47:17] matters in your Christian walk. You and
[47:19] God. Okay, there you are. See, there's
[47:21] your battle. Kill him at the beginning.
[47:23] stop him dead in his track. It ain't
[47:25] long It ain't how long you can make the
[47:28] war linger that to it. Stop it right
[47:30] now. Amen. So, a good war finishes
[47:33] quick. Amen. It's not about how long.
[47:35] I've been in this battle with the devil
[47:36] for a long time. It's your choice to end
[47:38] it or not. Stop entertaining his
[47:41] nonsense and him pointing out because
[47:43] remember, he's the accuser of the
[47:45] brethren. Amen. He sure he goes before
[47:48] God and accuses you know about us before
[47:50] him. But he also wants to do that same
[47:52] thing to you for you to look at those
[47:54] people and say well they believe that
[47:55] they believed in the coming of the Lord.
[47:57] They believed in the rapture and you
[47:59] know all these things. Look where they
[48:00] ended up. They believe the message. Look
[48:01] where they ended up. It's not about you
[48:03] and them. It's about you and God.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think it's very I'm going to
[48:07] be repeating this phrase, but I think
[48:08] it's very important. We walk with God.
[48:10] Enoch did not walk with everyone else
[48:12] and God. He walked with God and was not
[48:14] cuz God took him. Right? Sure, he had
[48:17] fellowship and all these things. He
[48:18] wasn't an island by himself, but he
[48:20] walked with God. Amen. And I pray if the
[48:22] Bible would continue to be written that
[48:24] our names were there would be there with
[48:26] Enoch.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you walked with God and were
[48:29] not because God took you.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's nobody else but you and
[48:34] God.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; And just look what God has done with his
[48:37] word and focus on that.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] You see what happens is people look
[48:43] around and they look at what others are
[48:45] doing.
[48:47] and they and they see what others have
[48:49] done with the word then they just
[48:50] readjust or do the opposite of what
[48:52] people have done. So for example,
[48:54] brother Bram says that you know the
[48:55] Pentecostals they took a minor which is
[48:57] speaking in tongues and gifts and things
[48:59] and made it a major. He says you can
[49:01] never major on a minor. So what people
[49:03] do is they take the minors and they
[49:04] throw them away because it's not a
[49:07] major. So why do we need them? We still
[49:08] need speaking in tongues. We need gifts
[49:10] of healing. We need prophecy. We need
[49:13] miracles. We need the moving of the Holy
[49:15] Spirit. We need the dynamics in the
[49:17] church. Remember, brother Bram said that
[49:19] the the dynamics of this church will be
[49:21] a refilling of the Holy Ghost that will
[49:23] pack us up into glory. Amen. So, we all
[49:25] need those things. This is still a
[49:27] Pentecostal move, not of denomination,
[49:29] but by experience where God has restored
[49:31] us back to the power of Pentecost, but
[49:33] with the true doctrine of Paul. Amen.
[49:36] So, we have the fundamentals and the
[49:37] mechanics together, the dynamics and the
[49:39] mechanics running together. Amen. So,
[49:41] we're not a people that just become
[49:43] anointed and then fall, but because
[49:45] we've been restored back to Paul's
[49:46] gospel, we're anointed and God lives us
[49:49] in us and we overcome.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we're being restored
[49:53] to. So, we can't take minors out, we
[49:56] need the whole thing.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know music, but I'm sure if
[50:01] if if someone, you know, the band was
[50:03] playing and you cut out all the minors,
[50:04] but the composer put the minors in the
[50:06] song. See, I might not be able to tell,
[50:08] but the composer Isaac, brother Isaac
[50:10] writes a song and and you guys are
[50:12] playing it and everyone says, "I'm just
[50:13] going to cut the minors out." Why? You
[50:15] know, we don't need the minors in the
[50:16] sheet music. He would say, "Hey, that
[50:18] song's wrong. You're playing it not
[50:20] according to the inspiration given to
[50:21] me." Right? And it's the same thing with
[50:23] the word of God. We can't take the
[50:25] minors out of the gospel. Amen. Cuz
[50:27] that's taking part of the word out of
[50:28] the word. And the whole word is a
[50:30] complete revelation. Amen. So, we can't
[50:32] take part of the word and say, "We don't
[50:33] need that anymore just because of what
[50:35] others have done." Who cares what
[50:37] they've done? We can't explain or why
[50:39] they've done those things they've done,
[50:40] but it's me and God. I'm going to give
[50:42] an account for my walk and my
[50:45] revelation. So, I'm just going to say,
[50:46] "Lord, reveal yourself to me in your
[50:48] word and I'll be very satisfied."
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's so important that
[50:53] we that we always stay in the spirit of
[50:57] the composer.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon speaks about uh being in
[51:00] the spirit of the composer quite a lot
[51:02] and the mighty God unveiled before us.
[51:04] And to me it just shows if you want to
[51:06] see the mighty God unveiled get into the
[51:08] spirit of the composer. I mean get into
[51:10] the spirit. Imagine if you see see this
[51:12] a lot of composers they conduct their
[51:14] own work because they've received the
[51:16] inspiration and they they are trusting
[51:19] that how they've trained their their
[51:21] musicians will be exactly this how they
[51:23] play it will be exactly the same way as
[51:25] the inspiration came to them. Right? And
[51:27] so can you imagine how there's this guy
[51:29] and he's and he's conducting away. He
[51:31] knows how the sheet sheet music should
[51:32] be. But then the lead violinist says,
[51:34] "No, I don't like those miners in that
[51:36] place." He'd probably get upset,
[51:39] &gt;&gt; right? I just want you to think about
[51:40] it. He'd get upset. It's like, "No, this
[51:42] is not how it came to me. I want it
[51:44] played how it came to me. That's why
[51:46] you're in the orchestra." Amen. And a
[51:48] lot of people have changed the word of
[51:50] God to make it play a different sound
[51:52] than what it is today. Like they say,
[51:54] the days of miracles have passed. I say
[51:55] they've taken out whole sheets of the
[51:57] music, right? Oh, he doesn't move like
[51:59] he used to. and we just got the word
[52:01] now. And we're, you know, we we just got
[52:02] to be stable and we can't be too, you
[52:05] know, emotional. All these things,
[52:06] emotion is part of the gospel. We're
[52:08] living people, right? Any anything
[52:10] without emotion is dead, right? We don't
[52:13] go running. We don't walk by emotion. We
[52:15] walk by revelation. Amen. But revelation
[52:17] will bring emotion.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the wise men, you know,
[52:21] they, you know, when they went into
[52:23] Jerusalem, they didn't see the star. And
[52:25] everyone was confused where where's you
[52:27] know what do you mean a star and the
[52:28] king and all these things and you know
[52:30] then they left this left the city after
[52:32] they found out he's to be born in
[52:33] Bethlehem. They saw the star again and
[52:36] they were exceeding they had exceedingly
[52:37] great joy. I think they did a dance on
[52:40] their camels when they went out and saw
[52:41] the star again. That one we were
[52:43] following now has appeared again after
[52:44] all this confusion we've been in. And
[52:46] you know they didn't throw out the Bible
[52:48] just because of what the scribes and
[52:49] Pharisees were doing in Jerusalem. They
[52:51] just kept following the word.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, friends of you,
[52:55] if your joy is gone, I'd say maybe
[52:56] you're just in a bit of confusion, but
[52:58] just get back following the message.
[53:00] Amen. And you'll find a joy come back
[53:02] into your step again because he will
[53:04] lead you to the Messiah. And in the
[53:06] Amen. The message has revealed the
[53:07] Messiah to us. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[53:10] So, we're going to be in in the spirit
[53:11] of the composer.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. In in the rhythm of the word,
[53:15] however that's playing, the crescendo,
[53:17] whatever is going on. Amen. You say, you
[53:20] know, we're all part of the orchestra.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:23] You can just be the, you know, it's like
[53:25] the guy who plays the big symbols maybe
[53:27] once or the triangle just a few times.
[53:29] You know, he's practicing just as much
[53:31] as the lead violin or the whatever. You
[53:33] know, he's, you know, you know, he, you
[53:35] know, he's practicing. He's waiting for
[53:36] his time. You know, maybe, you know, he
[53:38] gets up in the morning the same time he
[53:40] puts on his suit. He, you know, gets all
[53:42] ready. He's been practicing. He's been
[53:44] absorbed into the sheet music and the
[53:46] spirit of the composer. He stands there
[53:48] and he stands there and then it's this
[53:50] time he just goes ting, you know, and he
[53:53] puts it down and he's and you know and
[53:55] he waits for the rest to play out and
[53:56] he's finished.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, is the ting really that
[53:59] important?" To the composer it was.
[54:01] That's why he put it in the music. Amen.
[54:04] So, we may just be a little ting, but
[54:06] God wants our sound because we're part
[54:09] of the sheet music. We're part of his
[54:10] word. Amen. And if God's word can so
[54:13] transform a person, amen, to be part of
[54:16] his sheep music because we're ordained
[54:17] to be part of it, I think we should
[54:19] focus on what God has done with his
[54:21] word.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it would come to the
[54:24] end of the book of Revelation says and
[54:26] the spirit and the bride say come. Amen.
[54:28] Let let him that heareth say come and
[54:30] let him that is a thirst come and
[54:32] whosoever will let him take the water of
[54:34] life freely. Amen. So the spirit and the
[54:37] bride are saying the same thing. Amen.
[54:39] Why? Because the bride is in the spirit.
[54:42] Amen. They are anointed by the same one
[54:44] that gave the word. Amen. So they have
[54:46] full confidence that God can do what his
[54:49] word says it can do. Amen. We are not
[54:51] guessing. Can he fulfill his word or is
[54:54] his word right? Amen. We have been so
[54:56] God is so vindicated in this end time
[54:59] that his word is true. Amen. That he can
[55:01] con he's conquered hell, death, and the
[55:03] grave. And he's here to bring forth the
[55:05] greatest manifestation of the victory of
[55:07] the cross that's ever happened is going
[55:09] to happen in this day. Well, what's that
[55:11] victory going to be? The dead in Christ
[55:12] are going to rise. I mean, those that
[55:14] have truly received God's God's eternal
[55:17] gift of eternal life, his his Christmas
[55:20] present. Amen. And they're going to rise
[55:22] and we're going to be changed with them.
[55:23] Amen. It's going to be the full proof of
[55:25] the blood that it works. Amen. That God
[55:28] is going to do an incredible thing in
[55:29] this day. And we're living in a
[55:31] resurrection season.
[55:33] Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He made you alive, did he not?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; You were once dead in trespasses and
[55:37] sins. Amen. He's made you alive.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, what
[55:42] about what others have done?" It really
[55:44] doesn't matter.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how many quotes they use,
[55:47] scriptures they use, whatever they use.
[55:49] Don't worry about them.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Follow the Lord.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; What has God said about his word? What
[55:54] has he done with his word? He's brought
[55:56] it to manifestation. Amen. In every
[55:59] season, it's come to pass. Amen. When
[56:02] when when Noah was commanded to build an
[56:03] ark, what did he do? He built that ark.
[56:06] Amen. And what happened? The flood came
[56:08] everything. And he was carried to
[56:10] safety. And we could go through many
[56:12] promises of the Bible, many things God
[56:14] has promised to happen. And it's
[56:15] happened exactly the same way. And now
[56:17] God in this end time has restored a
[56:19] people to say what the spirit has said.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not saying something
[56:24] different. We're not taking away. We're
[56:27] not adding to. It's the same inspiration
[56:29] that gave the word is now living within
[56:31] you and I because we know what God has
[56:34] done with his word. And when we see what
[56:36] he's done with his word, he's made it
[56:37] fulfilled. If I'm going a bit fast, I'll
[56:39] try and go in the slow lane a bit. But,
[56:41] you know, I just want to get this point
[56:42] across. Let's focus on the word.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; What has he done with it? He's he's he's
[56:47] delivered. Amen. He's brought slaves out
[56:49] of Egypt and one man invasion. Amen.
[56:52] Conquered conquered the superpower of
[56:53] the age. Amen. You got to look at that.
[56:55] A man under the blood of bulls and
[56:56] goats. If he could do that and bring
[56:59] forth the creative power of God to bring
[57:01] a deliverance, how much more a people
[57:03] under the blood of Jesus Christ? Amen.
[57:05] And if and if a 180-year-old man can
[57:07] bring a people out of a superpower and
[57:09] bring a deliverance, how big is your
[57:11] problem then?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. What about your way with loved
[57:14] ones or your trouble you're facing in
[57:16] your life? If a man can do that under
[57:18] the blood of bulls and goats
[57:19] commissioned by God, how much more you
[57:21] and I, you've been sent as Moses has
[57:24] been sent. You've been commissioned by
[57:25] the word of God just like he did. Amen.
[57:27] Why? To bring a deliverance. Amen. That
[57:29] God would live in your life and prove
[57:31] his word.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 107. Then they cry unto the
[57:38] Lord in their trouble, and he saveth
[57:40] them out of their distresses. Trust
[57:42] you're in in this verse right now. I
[57:44] feel I'm here. Amen. He sent his word
[57:46] and healed them and delivered them from
[57:48] their destructions. Oh that man would
[57:50] praise the Lord for his goodness and for
[57:52] his wonderful works to the children of
[57:54] men. Let them sacrifice the sacrifices
[57:57] of thanksgiving and declare his works
[57:59] with rejoicing. Hallelujah. We can
[58:02] rejoice this morning. Amen. He's done
[58:04] incredible things. I mean he saved us
[58:06] from destruction. Amen. When we were
[58:08] actually our own human nature wanted to
[58:10] go that way. He interrupted your plans.
[58:13] He interrupted your steps. I mean cuz he
[58:15] was all he was determined. I'm going to
[58:17] raise up stones to be children of
[58:19] Abraham. I'm going to raise up ali rats
[58:21] and prostitutes and religious people and
[58:24] all these all all the rubbish of the
[58:26] world. God's risen up transformed.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I put myself on that statement. Amen.
[58:32] You would have you would have written me
[58:33] off if you saw me. But God didn't write
[58:35] me off. And God has not written you off.
[58:37] And God's not written off your family.
[58:39] Amen. He's not written off anybody. We
[58:41] can't write off anybody because God is
[58:44] more than able to do exceedingly
[58:46] abundantly above. we can ask or think.
[58:48] Amen. Cuz what has he done with his
[58:49] word? He sent it into impossible
[58:51] situations. I mean, he sent it into the
[58:53] fiery furnace. He stepped in himself
[58:55] into an impossible situation. And the
[58:58] three Hebrew men did not burn up. Amen.
[59:00] He sent his word into the lion's den.
[59:02] And Daniel wasn't eaten. Amen. He was
[59:04] delivered out of that thing. He sent his
[59:06] word into Egypt. Amen. Through the form
[59:08] of Moses and brought a mighty
[59:09] deliverance. Friends, how much more in
[59:11] 2025? He sent his word to this end time
[59:14] what to do. Bring a mighty deliverance.
[59:16] Amen. Amen. Bring healing. Bring
[59:18] restoration. Fill with the spirit. Amen.
[59:21] To line a people's hearts with his word.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's done many mighty
[59:26] things.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can rejoice. Amen. Praise the
[59:30] Lord.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; What has he done? What is his word? His
[59:35] spirit has quickened us to his word.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; He's made us alive. This is what God has
[59:40] done with his word. Remember, we were
[59:42] his enemies. There was a chasm of sin
[59:44] between us and God. Amen. We were
[59:46] aliens. We were his enemies. We were
[59:48] actively at war against him whether we
[59:51] realize it or not. Cuz unbelief puts us
[59:53] at polar opposites with God. Amen. And
[59:56] what did he do? He bridged that chasm.
[59:57] He destroyed that chasm that day on
[59:59] Calvary. Amen. What did he do? He sent
[1:00:01] his word with his with his spirit. He
[1:00:04] quickened you. Made it alive.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; The same faith when he believed his word
[1:00:10] in the beginning, let there be sun,
[1:00:11] moon, and stars. and he believed his own
[1:00:13] word.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Where's that faith now? It's in you.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "The life I now live, I live
[1:00:18] by the faith of the Son of God."
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; That same faith that said, "Let there be
[1:00:23] is now in you."
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want to find
[1:00:28] something here.
[1:00:33] What does that faith now do? He says,
[1:00:35] "By whom also we have access by faith
[1:00:37] into this grace wherein we stand and
[1:00:40] rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[1:00:43] Amen. So the faith that God has given us
[1:00:45] gives us access into this grace, this
[1:00:48] divine influence.
[1:00:51] That's why it's so important to take God
[1:00:53] at his word.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; See, when the devil points out someone
[1:00:56] else and their failures, he's trying to
[1:00:59] block an access to God's grace in your
[1:01:02] life.
[1:01:04] We got to we got to really look at this
[1:01:06] very seriously that we don't get
[1:01:08] critical against one another. We're all
[1:01:10] a work in progress. There's still
[1:01:12] scaffolding around this guy,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; right? There's still that I'm still a
[1:01:16] work in progress. The scaffolding will
[1:01:18] come down when this body's changed.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; I won't need I will be complete then.
[1:01:23] But until that time, God's working on
[1:01:25] me. He's working on my character. He's
[1:01:27] working on my attitude. He's working on
[1:01:29] my nature. He's working on how I treat
[1:01:31] others and myself and he's working on
[1:01:34] me.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And if God looks at me as a work in
[1:01:38] progress, how does he look at you all of
[1:01:40] us as a work in progress? So we should
[1:01:42] look at our each other in that same way.
[1:01:45] We are not the same people we were at
[1:01:47] the start of 2025.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz we've been a work in progress.
[1:01:53] Right? So if God can look at us in that
[1:01:55] way, I think we can look at one another
[1:01:57] that way.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. We can have grace
[1:02:00] one for another. I I I trust.
[1:02:04] Amen.
[1:02:07] Now,
[1:02:11] we have been
[1:02:14] God has been so good
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; to prove his word, but give us the grace
[1:02:20] to rejoice in him
[1:02:23] fulfilling his word.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Because we can look beyond the wrapping.
[1:02:28] We can look beyond the exterior.
[1:02:31] When Jesus would go into the synagogue
[1:02:33] there in Nazareth where he was brought
[1:02:35] up and he would stand there, it was
[1:02:38] given to him the scroll of the prophet
[1:02:39] Isaiah. And he would open that and he
[1:02:42] would he would find the part of the word
[1:02:45] he was to there to fulfill which is the
[1:02:47] spirit of laws upon me. He's anointed me
[1:02:49] to preach the gospel to the poor, set at
[1:02:51] liberty them that are bruised and you
[1:02:53] know, you know, recover the eyesight of
[1:02:54] the blind, all these things to to preach
[1:02:56] acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:02:59] The people there when they heard that
[1:03:01] did not rejoice.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't it Isn't it interesting? They did
[1:03:05] not rejoice that the prophecy that was
[1:03:08] there and they were just talking about
[1:03:09] was now living in front of them.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just idle words. He had
[1:03:14] proved already that prophecy was living
[1:03:16] in his life. And they weren't rejoicing
[1:03:19] saying, "Glory to God. This man that we
[1:03:22] saw as a boy and a teenager who has been
[1:03:24] risen up among us, he's the Messiah."
[1:03:27] They weren't happy about that. After
[1:03:29] this, they wanted to take him up to a
[1:03:32] cliff and throw him down. They wanted to
[1:03:33] kill him. They weren't filled with joy
[1:03:35] and elation.
[1:03:37] They were they were they were mad
[1:03:40] because the devil in them did not want
[1:03:43] God to fulfill his word.
[1:03:46] But God has been so good to us
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; that we rejoice. If we were in that
[1:03:51] crowd with the same spirit you have now
[1:03:54] in that crowd, you wouldn't have joined
[1:03:55] with what they were doing.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; There would have been a shout and a
[1:03:58] scream erupt in that synagogue like
[1:03:59] they've never heard.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you were there and you're
[1:04:03] you would realize he's fulfilling his
[1:04:06] word.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; What has God done with his word? He's
[1:04:08] fulfilling fulfilling it right in my in
[1:04:11] my midst.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we can now look and
[1:04:14] we can take that same scripture and we
[1:04:17] can bring it into a body of people and
[1:04:19] we can say God has set at liberty them
[1:04:21] that are bruised
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; because it's now not just the Messiah
[1:04:24] it's now messiah God is now living in a
[1:04:27] multi-membered people right and what
[1:04:29] happens now the the scripture that he
[1:04:31] said he was there to fulfill that same
[1:04:33] scripture is now the bride is to fulfill
[1:04:35] as well we see people come and they're
[1:04:37] spiritually blind their eyes come open
[1:04:39] that's a fulfillment of Isaiah's
[1:04:40] prophecy in this day them are bound up
[1:04:43] by complexes, pains and hurts, they get
[1:04:45] free.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing happening. God is
[1:04:48] because what this is what God has done
[1:04:50] with his word. I mean, he's taken a
[1:04:52] people that weren't a people and now
[1:04:54] he's molded them into his image, brought
[1:04:56] them together as a body that God can now
[1:04:59] live through that body. To me, it's an
[1:05:01] incredible thing.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz all the promise because if he
[1:05:06] is in you, that same scripture will be
[1:05:08] fulfilled in you.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as a people, we can see that
[1:05:11] and we can bear him witness. Yes, Lord,
[1:05:14] you have done incredible things. You
[1:05:16] see, because God's attitude towards his
[1:05:19] word is his word is right and it works.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; God has given us that same that same
[1:05:25] attitude, if I can just, you know, I
[1:05:27] probably need a better word than
[1:05:28] attitude. But you know that same
[1:05:30] revelation, that same understanding God
[1:05:32] has placed in our hearts that God's word
[1:05:35] works
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; and it lives.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see the reason he has
[1:05:39] given us that is because he wants to
[1:05:42] prove his word through his believing
[1:05:45] children. Now brother Bram says in
[1:05:46] proving his word. So no matter what how
[1:05:48] close you are to Jordan. No matter what
[1:05:50] your circumstances is you can only hold
[1:05:53] that promise of God in your I mean uh
[1:05:55] yeah sorry. You can only hold that
[1:05:56] promise of God in your heart. God will
[1:05:58] prove it that it's so in the midst of
[1:06:00] all unbelief. He'll still prove it to be
[1:06:02] so. Yes, he does it. And circumstances
[1:06:05] don't stop him. He still will do the
[1:06:08] same as he did then. Notice but it was
[1:06:10] by his believers that he proves his word
[1:06:13] by. He can only prove his word not by
[1:06:15] unbelievers. It's only by the believers
[1:06:17] that he can prove his word. No matter
[1:06:19] how much the rest of them claim to be,
[1:06:20] "Oh, I believe, brother. See, if you do,
[1:06:22] God will prove it so." Cuz we look and
[1:06:25] we see the others. How can we say then?
[1:06:27] See, it's by the true believers that he
[1:06:29] proves his word. Not by those who say
[1:06:32] they believe, but those who really
[1:06:33] believe. See, it's by his believing
[1:06:35] children that he proves his word. So,
[1:06:38] he's put he's put a revelation in our
[1:06:40] hearts. What has God done with his word?
[1:06:42] He puts that within us now. And now we
[1:06:45] have that same that same faith. God,
[1:06:47] your word is right. I'm not looking at
[1:06:49] what everyone else is is saying or
[1:06:52] doing. No,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; your word is true and I take you at your
[1:06:55] word.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the the wise men when they
[1:07:01] saw the star rise
[1:07:04] and they looked in the scripture cuz we
[1:07:05] know well brother Bram tells us that
[1:07:07] that Daniel trained the wise men there
[1:07:10] in Babylon or wherever they came from.
[1:07:12] And so that knowledge was passed down to
[1:07:14] now Jesus's day. And then so when the
[1:07:16] wise men because they had studied the
[1:07:18] stars and they saw that star rise in the
[1:07:20] west because they were east and they saw
[1:07:23] that and they went into the scripture
[1:07:25] and they realized that was the
[1:07:27] fulfillment of prophecy. Now they
[1:07:29] weren't interested in what it manifested
[1:07:32] as in terms of if he's in a palace or
[1:07:34] what they just knew the king of the Jews
[1:07:36] was born.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Right? So they weren't interested in the
[1:07:39] wrapping. They weren't interested in the
[1:07:41] manifestation. They just were looking
[1:07:42] for the king.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Right? So when and because it was a
[1:07:46] revelation to them, it wasn't a mental
[1:07:47] understanding. It was a revelation. So h
[1:07:50] however it came, it wasn't an offense to
[1:07:52] them. You see, to these religious people
[1:07:54] in the synagogue, Jesus was an offense
[1:07:57] because they did not have a revelation
[1:07:59] that he was the fulfillment of that
[1:08:01] scripture even though he was, right? But
[1:08:03] the wise men, they didn't care about
[1:08:05] what he looked like, where he was born,
[1:08:07] rich, poor, whatever. They were looking
[1:08:09] for the Messiah.
[1:08:11] And so what did they do? They went to
[1:08:12] Jerusalem. They're looking from there.
[1:08:14] didn't find them there. When they went
[1:08:15] to Bethlehem, they were, you know, they
[1:08:17] they were carrying very expensive gifts.
[1:08:19] They traveled a long way, you know, they
[1:08:21] weren't necessarily poor people. They,
[1:08:23] you know, but the thing is they it
[1:08:25] wasn't beneath them to go into a manger.
[1:08:27] I mean, to go into a stable, they
[1:08:29] weren't offended when they came to this
[1:08:31] small city and he was not in a house. He
[1:08:34] wasn't in a nice place. He was in
[1:08:36] literally a cave where the animals were.
[1:08:39] That did not offend them because why? He
[1:08:41] they weren't looking at that. They're
[1:08:44] looking at the gift on the inside of
[1:08:45] that stable. Amen. And that's what God
[1:08:48] wants us to look beyond is he doesn't
[1:08:50] want us to look at the manifestation of
[1:08:52] the is it rich, is it smart, is it
[1:08:54] clever, whatever more. No, he wants us
[1:08:56] to see his word and not to be offended
[1:08:58] by how it's fulfilled. And I believe I'm
[1:09:01] looking at a people who are not offended
[1:09:03] by how God fulfills his word because
[1:09:05] it's God fulfilling his word.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see,
[1:09:11] it's the same thing with Caleb and
[1:09:12] Joshua.
[1:09:14] They weren't interested or worried about
[1:09:16] the giants and the cities and the
[1:09:19] trouble that was in the promised land.
[1:09:21] No, it was revealed to them because God
[1:09:23] said in his word, I'm going to bring you
[1:09:25] out of Egypt with a mighty hand and I'm
[1:09:27] going to place you in the promised land.
[1:09:29] That's what God said. And they looked at
[1:09:31] said, "Well, what has God done with his
[1:09:32] word?" He proved it in Egypt. He's
[1:09:34] proved it in the wilderness. He's going
[1:09:36] to prove it before us as well. And so
[1:09:38] they're so the revelation they were
[1:09:40] carrying is well God's going to put us
[1:09:41] in the land in spite of the trouble, the
[1:09:44] opposition. Doesn't matter what other
[1:09:46] people have done in the land or are
[1:09:48] doing in the land. See like it doesn't
[1:09:49] matter what other people have done with
[1:09:51] the message or done with the Bible or
[1:09:53] done with whatever. It doesn't matter
[1:09:54] what they've done. My inheritance is in
[1:09:57] Christ. Amen. So I'm not going to let
[1:09:59] some giant of some intellectual
[1:10:01] understanding or some perverted doctrine
[1:10:03] put me out from possessing my promise.
[1:10:06] No, the promise is there for me. I don't
[1:10:08] care what other people have done. God's
[1:10:10] word is said the rapture is in in
[1:10:13] Christ. All things are in him. Every
[1:10:16] promise belongs to me. So, I'm not going
[1:10:18] to worry about what other people have
[1:10:19] done. What has God said about it? What
[1:10:22] has God done?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so Caleb and Joshua could
[1:10:25] look in there and say, "No, God's given
[1:10:27] us the land. Let's go get it."
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And they went and possessed it. 40 years
[1:10:31] later, we know. But they got it, right?
[1:10:33] Because why? It was revealed to them
[1:10:35] that it was theirs.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; So God proved his word through them.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] Now Jesus Jesus proved his Jesus proved
[1:10:48] see God's attitude towards his word is
[1:10:50] that his word is all powerful.
[1:10:54] Now when Jesus was in the wilderness I'm
[1:10:56] sorry I'm just trying to find a just
[1:10:57] trying to find a quote here. When Jesus
[1:10:59] after he was baptized he's led by the
[1:11:01] spirit into the wilderness and tempted
[1:11:02] by the devil. Now we we believe that the
[1:11:06] fullness of God here bodily was in
[1:11:07] Christ, right? He had all power. He was
[1:11:10] the creator made flesh. He could have
[1:11:13] spoken to the devil and made him
[1:11:15] disappear from every plane of existence.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; But what did he do? He didn't use his
[1:11:20] great powers upon the enemy. He used his
[1:11:23] word.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he used his word because so so
[1:11:27] what has God done with his word? He has
[1:11:29] proved that it will defeat Satan any
[1:11:32] place, anytime, anywhere. Right? See,
[1:11:35] Jesus could have done anything he wanted
[1:11:37] to the devil. He could have bound him
[1:11:38] into the lowest hell. He could have
[1:11:40] silenced his voice forever. He could
[1:11:41] have destroyed him just with a even a
[1:11:43] wink or a twinkle. He could have, you
[1:11:44] know, of an eye. Could have been all
[1:11:45] gone. But what did Jesus do? He wanted
[1:11:47] to place it to the hands of the weakest
[1:11:49] Christian. That doesn't matter how you
[1:11:51] feel. See, isn't it interesting? The
[1:11:53] devil never comes against a believer
[1:11:55] when they're feeling happy, when they're
[1:11:56] strong, when they're not tired, when
[1:11:58] they're not mentally worn out. He always
[1:12:00] comes against us at our weakest point.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Who's had the experience? You know,
[1:12:04] you're super tired, you're worn out,
[1:12:06] mind battles start coming. B say devil,
[1:12:08] go away. Business hours are closed. I
[1:12:10] got no time for this right now. But he
[1:12:11] always comes to you at your weakest
[1:12:14] point. And and this is what he did
[1:12:16] against the Lord Jesus. So he's going to
[1:12:17] do the same thing against you. So, we
[1:12:19] should not be surprised that when that
[1:12:22] when we feel stressed out, worn out,
[1:12:23] that's when the trouble really pours in
[1:12:25] because that's what the devil does. But
[1:12:27] you see, God God proved, amen, in the in
[1:12:30] the wilderness now that when you're in
[1:12:32] that state, my word works.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; I don't need to get a substitute. I can
[1:12:37] just quote the word of God against the
[1:12:39] enemy. Amen. And the enemy has to turn
[1:12:42] and run. Amen. His attack is totally
[1:12:45] defeated just by quoting the word. You
[1:12:47] say, "Well, what scripture do I need?"
[1:12:49] God will bring it to mind.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; You don't need to be all worked up.
[1:12:52] Well, do I need to know the right one?
[1:12:54] No. God will give you the right
[1:12:55] scripture to combat the enemy when he
[1:12:58] comes and brings the attack.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; That's why we've got to have, see, this
[1:13:01] is what God has done with his word. Now,
[1:13:03] we're going to let God do the same thing
[1:13:05] in our lives with his word. You see, if
[1:13:07] you have supreme confidence in his word,
[1:13:09] you're not going to turn to something
[1:13:10] else. You're not going to turn to human
[1:13:12] psychology or something that's contrary
[1:13:14] to the word. know you're going to just
[1:13:16] take the word of God and stand there
[1:13:18] with it.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; But when he meets Satan, I'm just
[1:13:24] reading the yellow there. He never used
[1:13:25] his power. He gives an example for the
[1:13:28] weakest of Christians. When he met
[1:13:30] Satan, he said, "It's written, man shall
[1:13:31] not live by bread alone, but by every
[1:13:33] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:13:34] God. The weakest Christian can take that
[1:13:37] stand. Hold it sure. God's in his word."
[1:13:40] Every time when he met the enemy, he
[1:13:41] said, "It's written. I believe he had
[1:13:42] power to do it." But he met Satan on the
[1:13:45] same grounds with the same word that you
[1:13:47] can meet him with.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he put it within your
[1:13:53] hands?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can just take the word of God,
[1:13:56] quoted your enemy, and he has to run.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what God did with his
[1:14:01] word.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He conquered the enemy with his
[1:14:04] word. And the Lord Jesus has placed the
[1:14:06] same ability in your life. Doesn't
[1:14:09] matter how you feel. Jesus was hungry.
[1:14:11] He was worn out by fasting. He was at
[1:14:13] his weakest point, but yet he quoted the
[1:14:15] word and Satan had to run. His attacks
[1:14:18] against him were defeated.
[1:14:20] Amen. It's the same thing with you and
[1:14:22] I.
[1:14:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:26] Amen. Now,
[1:14:30] so he's going to prove it. Now, what
[1:14:32] else did he do? I think I've already
[1:14:34] said it there with I'll not suffer the
[1:14:36] holy one to see corruption. But you see,
[1:14:38] the Lord Jesus proved his word. See, his
[1:14:41] attitude towards his word is his word
[1:14:43] works. Jesus had perfect faith in who he
[1:14:46] was.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. For this cause, I've
[1:14:48] come to the world to be the lamb of God.
[1:14:51] Amen. He knew who he was. He had perfect
[1:14:53] faith in who he was. And it gave him a
[1:14:55] perfect faith that he was going to
[1:14:57] fulfill what God has sent him to do.
[1:15:00] Now, this message has come to identify
[1:15:02] sons and daughters of God. This is what
[1:15:04] God has done with his word. He's
[1:15:06] identified God's children. Amen. We're
[1:15:08] not church members. We're not here by
[1:15:10] association or just part of a group. No,
[1:15:13] God has not sent his message to do that.
[1:15:16] He's come to identify sons and daughters
[1:15:18] of God.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he does this by revealing
[1:15:23] to us that this message is Messiah. It
[1:15:25] is Jesus Christ. I mean, that's what he
[1:15:27] did to the woman at the well. I mean,
[1:15:29] isn't it amazing? Jesus just gave a few
[1:15:32] a few phrases to her. Had a short
[1:15:34] conversation. He didn't explain a lot of
[1:15:36] things. He didn't come and talk about a
[1:15:39] lot of theology. He just said basically
[1:15:41] he that speaks to thee am he revealed
[1:15:44] her life, what she had been through,
[1:15:46] where she was. But then, you know, she
[1:15:48] just said, "We know where Messiah
[1:15:49] cometh. He He'll tell us all things."
[1:15:52] And and he just said, "Well, I'm he." It
[1:15:55] changed her whole life. Why did he go
[1:15:57] that way? Because there was a daughter
[1:15:59] of God that was wandering in darkness
[1:16:01] that the light needed to turn on. Amen.
[1:16:04] So, what did he do? He didn't come for
[1:16:05] the water. I just like this. He came for
[1:16:07] me.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Cuz he's identifying a
[1:16:10] daughter of God by his word. Amen. It's
[1:16:12] the same thing with you and I. This
[1:16:14] message has come to identify sons and
[1:16:16] daughters of God. That's why we're not
[1:16:18] part of Shakana Tabernacle. There's no
[1:16:20] membership here.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; There's no forms. There's no systematic
[1:16:23] way of joining. You cannot join this
[1:16:25] church.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can never join a message
[1:16:29] church. No. You join the kingdom of God
[1:16:31] by a birth.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the new birth. by one spirit
[1:16:34] were baptized into one body.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now if he has identified sons
[1:16:39] and daughters of God by his word, which
[1:16:41] he has, then what will he do? He's going
[1:16:43] to take his word and he's going to prove
[1:16:45] his word through them.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; So what has God done? We live in the
[1:16:49] what has God done with his word? He's
[1:16:52] allowed the world to get the darkest
[1:16:53] it's ever been. the most chaos, the most
[1:16:56] confusion, the most voices, the most,
[1:16:59] you know, someone could be sitting in
[1:17:01] Alaska somewhere and be watching this
[1:17:02] service or the end of the world, the
[1:17:04] opposite side of the world from New
[1:17:06] Zealand, Spain. They could be in Spain
[1:17:07] and watching the service. Everyone in
[1:17:09] the world could contact the service
[1:17:10] right now. My voice can go around the
[1:17:11] world in an instant. Everyone's opinion
[1:17:14] goes around the world. Right? So, what
[1:17:15] has he done? God, what has God done with
[1:17:17] his word? He's allowed the world to get
[1:17:19] so dark. Even brother couldn't see
[1:17:21] beyond 1977. It's so dark. How how long
[1:17:24] have we gone through that? You know,
[1:17:25] since then, many years.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; But God, what has he done with his word?
[1:17:30] He sent it into this darkness because he
[1:17:33] knows his word will prevail.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; He's not worried about you.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; He's not worried about what state you
[1:17:40] find yourself in today cuz he's looking
[1:17:42] from eternity.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sees us perfected, glorified, I
[1:17:47] mean, in in eternal bodies around his
[1:17:50] throne already cuz he's outside of time.
[1:17:53] I mean, he's not bound within what we
[1:17:54] can see. He looks far beyond. Amen. So,
[1:17:57] friends, if this is what he's done with
[1:17:59] his word, he has confidence in his word.
[1:18:01] He has supreme confidence. I mean, when
[1:18:03] he died on Calvary, he wasn't guessing.
[1:18:05] Have I done enough? No, he knew. He knew
[1:18:08] exactly he had paid it in full. He paid
[1:18:10] the debt in full. Like, you know, like
[1:18:12] Abraham and Shadow buying the burying
[1:18:14] place for Sarah. Paid the full amount
[1:18:16] for the ground. I mean, for the for the
[1:18:18] cave of Mpella. Paid paid the full
[1:18:20] amount. He didn't have to pay a deposit
[1:18:22] anymore. No, he paid it in full. He made
[1:18:24] sure that that was a total that was
[1:18:26] bought. The boundaries, everything were
[1:18:28] there that there was no dispute. And
[1:18:30] when Jesus died on Calvary, he paid our
[1:18:32] redemption in full. He paid for the
[1:18:34] redemption of the whole world. Amen. He
[1:18:36] paid for the new heavens and new earth,
[1:18:37] the renovation of this world, the
[1:18:39] destruction of the enemy. He he paid for
[1:18:41] it all.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he made sure that in Christ,
[1:18:44] in his word, there's a burying place. I
[1:18:47] mean, there's a there's a place of
[1:18:48] safety. And it's like, don't bury me in
[1:18:50] this world. bury me in Christ. Amen. Cuz
[1:18:53] that's where the resurrection is going
[1:18:54] to take place. Amen. So what has God
[1:18:56] done with his word? He sent it to this
[1:18:58] darkest of ages. This world is in a
[1:19:01] chaos. Amen. But God sent his word into
[1:19:03] chaos to bring order in your life. Amen.
[1:19:05] That this world can fall apart. But
[1:19:07] you're still standing. And it's not by
[1:19:09] your ability. It's not by how smart you
[1:19:11] are. It's not how clever you are, your
[1:19:13] finances or nothing. No, it's God's
[1:19:15] supreme grace. Amen. has come into your
[1:19:17] life by his word because God has full
[1:19:20] confidence, friends. He's not afraid. He
[1:19:22] knows his word works. Amen. If he can
[1:19:25] say, "Let there be sun, moon, and stars
[1:19:26] and it worked." Amen. That he sent his
[1:19:29] word down through the ages and it's
[1:19:30] worked. It's going to work and it is
[1:19:32] working in this end time. Amen. We are
[1:19:35] not out of the care of the Lord. Amen.
[1:19:38] Praise the Lord. Amen. This is what God
[1:19:40] has done with his word. He's He has
[1:19:42] risen up stones, the children of
[1:19:44] Abraham. He has taken the unlikely of
[1:19:46] the world. I I I love this cuz I'm in
[1:19:49] that category. Amen. He has taken people
[1:19:52] that never would be considered to be the
[1:19:54] sons and daughters of God. You look at
[1:19:56] the first stones built into the temple
[1:19:59] of God in the New Testament. Peter tried
[1:20:02] to kill a guy. The ignorant the
[1:20:05] ministers could not even read or write,
[1:20:06] sign their own name. There were people
[1:20:08] like the woman at the well, the
[1:20:09] prostitutes, all these different ones
[1:20:11] that because God, what was he doing? He
[1:20:13] was gathering stones. He's gathering
[1:20:15] stones through his ministry. He went,
[1:20:17] what did he do? He called Peter, James,
[1:20:18] and John. Come follow me. What is he
[1:20:20] doing? Gathering stones. I mean, to make
[1:20:23] them his children, to make them his
[1:20:24] bride. I mean, but if you looked at 120,
[1:20:27] you'd say, "They ain't the New Testament
[1:20:29] church. They'd never be the bride of
[1:20:31] Jesus Christ." But God was looking
[1:20:32] beyond the exterior cuz he doesn't look
[1:20:34] at the exterior. He doesn't look at the
[1:20:36] wrapping. He looks at the gift. Amen.
[1:20:38] That love gift of Christ that's in our
[1:20:40] life. Amen. That seed of predestination.
[1:20:42] He looks at that. Hallelujah. And so
[1:20:45] what he's doing, he's gathering stones.
[1:20:47] Amen. And and if he started the building
[1:20:49] that way, he's going to end the building
[1:20:51] that way. Amen. Where there's a people
[1:20:53] that have been redeemed by the blood of
[1:20:54] Jesus Christ. Amen. That have the same
[1:20:56] attitude towards his word that he does.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; So, who cares what man has done with his
[1:21:03] word? What has God done with his word? I
[1:21:05] mean, God has done incredible things. I
[1:21:07] think we can rejoice in this Christmas
[1:21:09] present that he's given us of eternal
[1:21:11] life. He picked you up. He turned you
[1:21:13] around. Place your feet on solid ground.
[1:21:15] Place your feet on the revelation of the
[1:21:17] word. Amen. Cause you to realize you're
[1:21:19] part of the You're part of the symphony.
[1:21:21] You're part of his sheet music. Amen.
[1:21:23] You're part of his word. God has made
[1:21:25] you this. It's not you. It's him that
[1:21:27] has done it.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He came looking for me.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the darkest of ages where where
[1:21:34] God's not welcome in many places. Amen.
[1:21:36] He came looking for you and I. Praise
[1:21:38] the Lord. He sent forth his word. I
[1:21:40] mean, he sent a message into this end
[1:21:42] time what to do to lift up a people,
[1:21:44] reveal who they are in Christ. Give them
[1:21:46] prevailing power of revelation. Amen. To
[1:21:49] show them the revelation he had to
[1:21:51] overcome. That same revelation comes
[1:21:53] into you
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; and you overcome.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He vindicates his word. We don't
[1:22:00] need to We don't need to worry about
[1:22:02] what anyone else does. I'm going to be
[1:22:03] wrapping this up, but we don't need to
[1:22:05] worry about what anyone else has done.
[1:22:06] Don't worry about it.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. What has God done with his word?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; What has he done with his word?
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; He's raptured people. Enoch was
[1:22:16] raptured. Elijah was raptured. Amen.
[1:22:19] Elijah stood there all alone on Mount
[1:22:21] Carmel. God proved his word.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; God's a God of fire. He's a consuming
[1:22:25] fire. Amen. He is he he he brought
[1:22:28] Lazarus out of the grave with his word.
[1:22:30] Amen. He brought Legion. Legion wasn't
[1:22:32] legion after that visitation. Why? Cuz
[1:22:34] that was God what God did with his word.
[1:22:36] Now God wants to take that same word,
[1:22:39] put it in you, anoint you with it. Amen.
[1:22:42] And then you speak it and God will do
[1:22:44] the same things. Amen. Brother Ram said
[1:22:46] when a son of God or I say a daughter of
[1:22:48] God takes the word of God in faith and
[1:22:50] speaks it across their lips inspired,
[1:22:52] it's the same as deity speaking, every
[1:22:55] mountain has to move. Nothing can stand
[1:22:57] before that man or woman. That's what
[1:22:58] God has done with his word.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen God anoint lips of
[1:23:05] clay.
[1:23:06] Oh, that was in the prophet's day. No,
[1:23:08] it's in this day.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that believeth on me, greater
[1:23:11] works than these shall you do.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz I go to the father.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, well, we need the
[1:23:17] prophet to come back. No, we don't. We
[1:23:19] got the God of the prophet.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; We got the God of the message living in
[1:23:22] human people. Living in humans once
[1:23:25] again, deity in humanity.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; That's what God's done with his word.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; I know other people have said that.
[1:23:32] Don't worry about them.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; What's he done in your life?
[1:23:36] He's restored us back to a true
[1:23:38] Pentecostal experience. But I know
[1:23:39] people have gone ran wild with that.
[1:23:41] Don't worry about them.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; What's he done with you?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; What's he done with you? Have you really
[1:23:47] been born again? You really must meet
[1:23:49] God. He's not an idea. You don't just
[1:23:51] grow into it. God changes a life. Like
[1:23:54] we saw Mo Mo here before they left. He
[1:23:57] said a previous and I'm sure we can all
[1:23:59] see there was a transformation taking
[1:24:01] place
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; from what he was even just a year before
[1:24:03] to what he became. He said, "Because at
[1:24:05] the previous camp, he received the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; A light turned on. A light came into his
[1:24:11] life."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Why? What happened? God transformed him
[1:24:15] and we could see it.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't just evolve into that. God
[1:24:19] quickened his seed.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; He had a meeting with God.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful that same meeting
[1:24:25] you say, "Well,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; how's it going to happen?" God is God is
[1:24:29] individual.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; But you can look back in your life and
[1:24:32] say from that time something happened.
[1:24:34] Something changed in my life. I'm no
[1:24:36] longer that same person.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; What has he done with his word? He's
[1:24:41] proved it
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; over and over and over again.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not worried about the critic.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not worried about the naysayer.
[1:24:51] That's not my portion. My portion is I'm
[1:24:54] walking with God
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and God has proven his word.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in closing, I know I've
[1:25:00] been a bit short, but just in closing,
[1:25:03] this is good. I think if you want to
[1:25:05] match something, match your experience
[1:25:06] against Paul's.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need today is a
[1:25:09] matching time with Paul's faith in the
[1:25:11] Bible. That's our example, right? Real
[1:25:13] matching time. Don't try to match your
[1:25:15] neighbor. Match some of the saints of
[1:25:16] the Bible. If you're a saint, act like a
[1:25:19] saint, walk like a saint, dress like a
[1:25:22] saint, talk like a saint, pray like a
[1:25:24] saint, believe like a saint, shout like
[1:25:26] a saint, be like a saint, live like a
[1:25:28] saint, die like a saint, go to heaven
[1:25:30] like a saint.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we should look at.
[1:25:34] Hallelujah. That's what we're ordained
[1:25:37] to have. Live like a saint. People say,
[1:25:40] "It's between me and God. They're living
[1:25:41] in drugs and in the world." Let God
[1:25:42] change you.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Why? You know, we don't have any
[1:25:45] scarecrows to hide behind. Just go
[1:25:47] beyond the scarecrow.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let God transform your life. See,
[1:25:50] don't let the battle drag on. Why not
[1:25:52] end the battle?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Why not just have a victory over that
[1:25:55] thing?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why not dress like a saint?
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Why not be a saint? Why not shout like a
[1:26:01] saint?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Go to heaven like a saint.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; This is what God's done with his word.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[1:26:10] God has made us sinless as he is
[1:26:13] sinless. Remember, he became sin for us
[1:26:16] who knew no sin.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That would become the very righteousness
[1:26:19] of God in Christ.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, one day. No, no, today. If you're in
[1:26:24] Christ, you're as righteous as God is
[1:26:26] righteous.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; You're sinless as God is sinless. Even
[1:26:29] in these mortal bodies, that's what God
[1:26:32] has done with his word.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; There's no condemnation to walk after
[1:26:36] the spirit which are in Christ.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; That's what God has done with his word.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; He's given us prevailing power.
[1:26:43] What has he done? He's given us
[1:26:45] overcoming power.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; He's given us a life that we don't need
[1:26:48] to fear nothing.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; The enemy is defeated.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Don't give him any time in your mind
[1:26:54] that he can win. He can't win. He's
[1:26:56] already lost. He's already lost the war.
[1:26:59] He doesn't want to admit it, but he's
[1:27:00] lost, right? He has he has been defeated
[1:27:03] on Calvary. Our God is victorious.
[1:27:05] That's what God has done with his word.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has defeated our God is
[1:27:11] supreme.
[1:27:13] He has full confidence in who he is
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; and what he can do.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Ask you the question this morning. Do
[1:27:18] you have the same confidence
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; that his word
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; can do what it says it can do?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians, please.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:47] Aren't you glad God gave you grace
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; to look at what God has done with his
[1:27:52] word to look beyond everything else? Cuz
[1:27:56] those things are there. We understand.
[1:27:58] But we can look. God has given us
[1:27:59] eyesight to look at what God has done
[1:28:01] with his word and to walk with him.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; God bless, brother Isaac. Nothing slows
[1:28:15] you down.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand, shall we?
[1:28:19] Amen. Let's sing that song. There's
[1:28:20] power, power, wonder working power in
[1:28:22] the blood.
[1:28:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:38] There is
[1:28:40] power.

[1:28:48] power in the blood
[1:28:52] of the lamb.
[1:28:54] There is power, power, wonder working
[1:28:58] power in the Jesus blood of the lamb.
[1:29:05] Would you be free from your burden of
[1:29:08] sin? There's power in the blood. Yes.
[1:29:12] Power in the blood. Oh, would you? Oh,
[1:29:16] evil of victory win. There's wonderful
[1:29:21] power in the blood.

[1:29:28] power in the blood
[1:29:32] of the lamb.

[1:29:39] power in the preious blood of the lamb.
[1:29:45] Oh, would you be free from your passion
[1:29:48] and pride? There's power in the blood.
[1:29:52] Yes, power in the blood. Oh, come for a
[1:29:56] cleansing to Calvary sight. There's
[1:30:00] wonderful power in his blood.

[1:30:08] working power in the blood
[1:30:12] of the lamb.

[1:30:19] power in the precious blood of the lamb.
[1:30:26] Would you be whiter, much wider than
[1:30:29] snow? There's power in the blood.

[1:30:37] lost in its lifegiving flow, there's

[1:31:14] power in the blood. Oh, would you live
[1:31:18] daily his praises to sing? There's
[1:31:22] wonderful power in the blood.

[1:31:50] working power in the blood
[1:31:55] of the lamb.
[1:31:57] There is power, power, wonder working
[1:32:02] power in the precious blood of the lamb.
[1:32:08] Amen.
[1:32:10] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for
[1:32:11] that?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? Rising up.
[1:32:15] There's a New Testament church rising
[1:32:17] up.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God's done with his
[1:32:19] word.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:24] So thankful for that.
[1:32:31] As I look out across the land, I see
[1:32:35] God's mighty hand. The bride of Christ
[1:32:39] adorned in a wedding gown.
[1:32:44] Oh, just like in the days of old, they
[1:32:47] stood in courage bold and turned the
[1:32:51] whole world upside down.

[1:33:19] up.

[1:33:26] Ghost fell. Signs and wonders were done
[1:33:30] by the apostles hands.
[1:33:34] Or demon spirits were cast out. In jail
[1:33:39] they sing and shout while surrounded by
[1:33:43] God's holy angel band.
[1:33:47] Oh rising up.
[1:33:50] We're rising up.

[1:36:26] that? Amen. You're part of that New
[1:36:28] Testament church. That New Testament
[1:36:29] bride, God has risen up. Amen. Praise
[1:36:32] the Lord. Let's uh let's bow heads in a
[1:36:33] word of prayer. Amen. Gracious father,
[1:36:36] we thank you so much. Help us, dear God,
[1:36:38] ways to focus on what you have done with
[1:36:40] your word, not what others have done,
[1:36:42] what you have done. Lord, you've proved
[1:36:44] it over and over and over again. You are
[1:36:47] faithful and true, Lord, to your word.
[1:36:49] You are your word, dear God. We're so
[1:36:51] thankful, Lord, that we can take you at
[1:36:53] your word, Lord Jesus, that we just, as
[1:36:56] you said, to only believe. And you've
