[50:54] you know you know we we don't want to be
[50:57] slacking around and just saying i'm in
[50:59] the message that's just a bunch of
[51:00] religion if you want it to be you know
[51:02] yes
[51:03] but we are here because the lord has a
[51:05] vision of you amen and so we're going to
[51:08] look into some things this morning i'm
[51:10] going to do the the most impossible
[51:12] thing i'm going to cram a five-hour
[51:13] sermon into one hour 10 minutes
[51:17] so you're going to have to hang on to
[51:18] your seats
[51:20] and uh i just pray that the lord will
[51:23] bless you mightily so we're going to go
[51:24] and look at a scripture uh how does this
[51:27] thing go
[51:28] uh
[51:29] i'm just a little bit nervous at the
[51:31] moment i've been preaching for 30 years
[51:33] i'm still going to get get
[51:34] nervous flick it on
[51:40] you just give that
[51:42] just make sure that it's all turned on
[51:44] by the handy
[51:46] does it go
[51:50] how come it doesn't go bro
[51:54] hey okay
[51:55] try it again
[51:58] put up the first slide there
[52:01] okay let's just look at this now
[52:05] i want to thank
[52:06] andy and his dear wife and family for
[52:08] the hospitality
[52:10] it's been really wonderful
[52:12] now we're going to look at our opening
[52:13] scripture
[52:16] the climax of a person's life
[52:19] [Music]
[52:20] and he says in the proverbs here
[52:23] two things
[52:25] have i required of thee deny me
[52:28] them not before i die
[52:32] remove far from me vanity
[52:35] and lies amen amen
[52:38] give me neither poverty or riches
[52:41] feed me with food convenient
[52:44] for me amen
[52:46] not just any food now amen
[52:48] that's not not just uh what jesus once
[52:51] did food
[52:52] but food convenient
[52:55] for now
[52:56] amen
[52:57] praise the lord let us bow our heads
[52:59] heavenly father lord i pray
[53:03] just make these words alive lord and i
[53:05] pray we'll give you the glory lord we
[53:06] ask in jesus wonderful name amen amen
[53:11] now we are living in this age called
[53:14] laodicea we know that laodicea means
[53:16] people's rights and everyone's got
[53:18] rights but it is an age of narratives
[53:21] it is an age of conforming powers
[53:25] and it is an age of psychological
[53:28] influence
[53:29] that right yes and there's an age where
[53:32] satan is drawing up he's making up
[53:34] scenarios to draw you into
[53:38] amen
[53:39] he he makes scenarios to draw you into
[53:43] an entrapment
[53:45] and then he draws you into something and
[53:48] as he traps you then he blames you
[53:51] for being the one that caused the
[53:53] problem and initiated the problem
[53:56] amen that's exactly right is that right
[54:01] and if you accept
[54:03] what you have been entrapped in as real
[54:07] not even the lord can help you
[54:12] until you refuse to accept the condition
[54:15] that you agreed to
[54:18] and when you realize the entrapment that
[54:21] that has come to you and you go to the
[54:23] lord and he puts it under the blood
[54:27] he not only justifies you but the one
[54:30] who entrapped you he then puts it back
[54:32] on to the one he who trapped you yes
[54:37] so here so devil's been trying to put it
[54:39] into your lap now god puts it back into
[54:41] his lap amen
[54:43] praise the lord amen
[54:45] now we're going to go into some deeper
[54:47] things now so you just just have to keep
[54:48] with me
[54:51] because you have to know who you are in
[54:53] this hour
[54:55] you cannot think like a new zealander
[54:57] you cannot think from whatever culture
[54:59] that you come from that will not work
[55:03] the only power in this hour that you can
[55:06] look at that keeps you in a stable
[55:08] condition is knowing your true identity
[55:12] to know yourself as god sees you
[55:15] not as you see yourself but as god sees
[55:18] you yes sir
[55:20] that's right
[55:22] now watch down revelations 2 verse 17
[55:24] hear that heavenly and now this is for
[55:26] the
[55:27] an earlier church age not follow this
[55:29] here
[55:30] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[55:32] spirit saith unto the churches to whom
[55:34] that overcometh will i give to eat of
[55:37] the hidden manna yes and i will give him
[55:40] a white stone and us and in the stone a
[55:43] new name written which no man knoweth
[55:46] saving he that receiveth it
[55:49] so this
[55:50] what that we are in brothers and sisters
[55:53] is something that only you know about
[55:56] personally in your life
[55:59] a revelation is not something that you
[56:01] can give to somebody else it's personal
[56:04] to you
[56:07] now in the old testament
[56:10] the old testament were shadows pointing
[56:13] to reality at the end time
[56:17] now if you notice in the old testament
[56:20] temple
[56:21] there was a pot in the temple in the
[56:23] holy of holies
[56:26] where they stored some manner that fell
[56:29] every day but they picked some of it up
[56:31] and put it into a pot in the holy of
[56:33] holies yes that's right in that place
[56:36] that manner never rot it is that right
[56:41] and it could only be consumed once a
[56:43] year by
[56:44] a high priest
[56:47] when he went into the presence of the
[56:48] lord
[56:50] and it was only for that high priest
[56:54] and so
[56:56] nobody on the outside could access that
[56:59] hidden manner
[57:02] it was only personal glory
[57:05] to the priest
[57:07] that's right
[57:13] [Music]
[57:16] we're just building up something okay
[57:19] see if this is all going up
[57:22] now a profit comes
[57:26] and he says each age has a portion of
[57:28] hidden manner
[57:30] then comes the fullness at the end time
[57:32] that light never shined on
[57:36] then he says now then there's also a
[57:38] thought of the future partaking of
[57:40] hidden manner
[57:43] i think it will be the eternal partaking
[57:45] of the revelation of jesus christ
[57:48] and we'll go down to the last part and
[57:50] then the blue says but one day when our
[57:52] flesh changes the word and he will
[57:55] become what we have never dreamed
[57:58] possible
[58:00] now we are n and a
[58:02] glory hallelujah
[58:05] that god is releasing a revelation from
[58:09] within us
[58:12] that will change our bodies
[58:15] but you have to agree to that hallelujah
[58:18] amen
[58:23] so now at the end time when those seals
[58:26] were revealed
[58:29] from those seals
[58:31] comes a breaking away from your six seal
[58:34] earthly identity
[58:36] to your seventh seal heavenly identity
[58:39] yes and he's removing the dark glasses
[58:42] off of us so we can see ourselves as god
[58:46] sees us
[58:49] now
[58:50] let's go on to with another scripture
[58:52] just building up a big platform okay
[58:55] this is going to go it might shock you
[58:57] this this sermon okay
[58:59] it might be a real shocker
[59:07] go to this
[59:08] next one please bro this thing's not
[59:10] going this thing's not there we are
[59:13] now watch
[59:15] when the temple was being dedicated by
[59:17] solomon
[59:18] in the old testament
[59:22] he spoke certain words
[59:24] and those words carried on all the way
[59:29] right down to the ions of time
[59:33] but as the temple changed
[59:36] the attitude of the people had to be
[59:38] looking
[59:40] at where god was
[59:42] now watch now
[59:44] and one kings verse 8 uh chapter 8 verse
[59:46] 33
[59:48] solomon's speech at the dedication of
[59:50] the temple where the lord came
[59:54] down
[59:56] when my people israel be smitten down
[59:58] before the enemy
[1:00:01] and we're living in a very evil age
[1:00:04] because they've sinned against thee
[1:00:06] and shall turn again to thee and confess
[1:00:08] thy name and pray and make supplication
[1:00:11] into this house
[1:00:14] now we're talking back then about the
[1:00:15] temple
[1:00:17] okay
[1:00:19] but i want to know where is the temple
[1:00:25] where's the temple today
[1:00:28] then you shall hear in heaven and
[1:00:30] forgive the sin of thy people israel
[1:00:33] and bring them again unto the land which
[1:00:36] thou gave us unto their fathers
[1:00:40] now just keep those thoughts now
[1:00:43] now we have to look at the mystery of
[1:00:45] the temple
[1:00:49] because the temple is a progressive
[1:00:52] revelation
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:55] that must end up with a conclusion
[1:00:59] so now it starts as a heavenly vision
[1:01:04] that moses was shown a heavenly vision
[1:01:07] of the temple
[1:01:09] in heaven
[1:01:13] now that heavenly vision
[1:01:16] had to be made
[1:01:17] and it's something tangible on the earth
[1:01:22] that's right so he saw this vision
[1:01:26] and this vision was the same vision in
[1:01:28] revelations 4 in revelation chapter 5
[1:01:31] and he makes on the earth a tabernacle
[1:01:36] now we'll just show you the the these
[1:01:39] the scriptures because it's going to be
[1:01:40] a bit laborious for a starter next one
[1:01:42] please brothers
[1:01:45] now watch the words
[1:01:47] now he's seeing this vision in heaven
[1:01:50] let them make me a sanctuary that i may
[1:01:52] dwell among them according to all that i
[1:01:54] show you so moses i'm going to show you
[1:01:56] something
[1:01:58] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[1:02:00] the pattern of the instruments thereof
[1:02:01] even so shall you make it and they shall
[1:02:04] make an arc of chopper in wood two
[1:02:06] cubits and a half shall be the length of
[1:02:08] robin a cubit and a half the bread the
[1:02:10] of and the cubit and the half the height
[1:02:12] thereof now when god makes something
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:17] he works from the inside to the outside
[1:02:20] amen when you do something you went from
[1:02:24] the outside to the inside
[1:02:27] but god is interested in the inside
[1:02:32] then the outside will take care of
[1:02:33] itself
[1:02:36] then he says in verse 21 and you shall
[1:02:38] put the mercy seat above the ark and the
[1:02:40] ark shall put the test and you shall put
[1:02:43] the testimony that that i shall give
[1:02:44] thee and there will i meet with thee and
[1:02:47] i will commune with thee from above the
[1:02:49] mercy seat between the two cherubims and
[1:02:52] upon the ark of the testimony of all the
[1:02:54] things i will give thee in commandment
[1:02:56] upon unto the children of israel
[1:02:59] so now
[1:03:01] moses i want you to make something
[1:03:04] i want you to make a tabernacle
[1:03:07] and this tabernacle that you are making
[1:03:10] is going to unfold into a revelation
[1:03:13] that it's going to be concluded at the
[1:03:15] end time
[1:03:20] it will be concluded
[1:03:22] at the time when the hidden manner
[1:03:26] is being revealed yes amen
[1:03:30] so now
[1:03:32] moses
[1:03:33] is catching this vision
[1:03:38] and he
[1:03:40] comes and he makes this earthly
[1:03:42] tabernacle
[1:03:47] and this earthly tabernacle is on a
[1:03:49] journey that's right hey matt
[1:03:53] so a heavenly vision is on
[1:03:56] a journey that's right
[1:03:58] through time yes
[1:04:02] and as time progressed
[1:04:04] the lord added more information
[1:04:08] to the vision that came to moses
[1:04:13] he gave more river information to the
[1:04:16] revelation of the tabernacle
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] and moses the prophet had to lay out
[1:04:25] certain actions that pertained to the
[1:04:28] temple
[1:04:30] now watch when this temple was built by
[1:04:33] moses
[1:04:36] next one please brothers
[1:04:40] this tabernacle had to be anointed
[1:04:44] and moses took the anointing oil and
[1:04:46] anointed the tabernacle and all that was
[1:04:48] therein
[1:04:49] and sanctified them
[1:04:52] he sprinkled there upon the altar seven
[1:04:55] times and upon the altar and all the
[1:04:58] vessels both the lava and his foot to
[1:05:01] sanctify them and he poured of the
[1:05:03] anointing oil upon aaron's head and
[1:05:06] anointed him to sanctify him now i want
[1:05:08] you to watch that the tabernacle had to
[1:05:10] be anointed once
[1:05:13] by a prophet
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:16] every time you see about a tabernacle it
[1:05:20] must have been anointed by a prophet
[1:05:25] but it was sprinkled seven times
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:33] but when solomon came along
[1:05:36] and he built the temple
[1:05:39] it was not anointed again
[1:05:42] because they've already been anointed
[1:05:44] once
[1:05:46] and never to be anointed again
[1:05:48] on something that is made by man's
[1:05:51] hands
[1:05:53] i want you to catch these things now
[1:05:56] so now when moses the prophet anointed
[1:06:01] the tabernacle
[1:06:03] he anointed
[1:06:04] everything that pertained to it the
[1:06:07] priesthood
[1:06:08] all the furniture
[1:06:10] everything that pertained to that
[1:06:12] tabernacle a prophet
[1:06:15] anointed it yeah thank you lord all
[1:06:17] right amen god you catch this oh yeah
[1:06:20] because of because this denominational
[1:06:23] world out there it's missed the plot
[1:06:25] because it missed its profit
[1:06:30] now this tabernacle that moses built
[1:06:34] it had no city
[1:06:38] it was not constructed with any stones
[1:06:44] amen
[1:06:47] so as the heavenly vision of the pattern
[1:06:49] went from tabernacle to temple
[1:06:52] more information was given to the
[1:06:54] revelation
[1:07:02] this temple that moses sorry that
[1:07:05] solomon built
[1:07:07] david wanted to build it but he shed
[1:07:10] much blood
[1:07:12] he got many of the ingredients to build
[1:07:15] that tabernacle but his at that temple
[1:07:18] but solomon had to be the one to do it
[1:07:21] but it had to be in a certain
[1:07:23] geographical location
[1:07:26] it had to be placed
[1:07:29] in a location where
[1:07:31] david sinned
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:39] because
[1:07:41] counted his soldiers
[1:07:47] he counted the people sorry
[1:07:50] that he had dominion over
[1:07:52] and he sinned against god
[1:07:54] because he was putting his trust
[1:07:57] in human ability
[1:07:59] and not trusting in god and an angel
[1:08:02] came and smote tens of thousands of
[1:08:05] david's people
[1:08:07] and the angel came and met david
[1:08:10] on the threshing floor of ornan the
[1:08:14] jebusites
[1:08:17] so now
[1:08:22] on a threshing floor
[1:08:25] was where
[1:08:26] things happen
[1:08:28] on a threshing floor
[1:08:30] chaff is separated from the wheat
[1:08:34] on a threshing floor
[1:08:36] is where your old nature gets thrashed
[1:08:39] away from you
[1:08:40] and your true identity comes into full
[1:08:43] expression yes amen
[1:08:47] now we would go a little bit further
[1:08:48] again
[1:08:50] next one please brothers
[1:08:53] now watch now
[1:08:55] here's solomon
[1:08:59] he's built this temple it took seven
[1:09:02] years to build
[1:09:04] the conclusion of the matter is at the
[1:09:06] end time
[1:09:08] seven church ages it takes to bring the
[1:09:10] temple to its conclusion
[1:09:15] mount moriah
[1:09:18] was chosen as the place to build the
[1:09:20] temple
[1:09:22] because of the sin
[1:09:24] of a man
[1:09:26] and so that temple
[1:09:29] was to show us something now remember in
[1:09:31] the book of ruth
[1:09:34] ruth met boaz in a certain place
[1:09:39] he met she met boaz on the threshing
[1:09:42] floor
[1:09:45] after that she had decided
[1:09:49] after sorry after she had decided and
[1:09:52] labored
[1:09:54] she met boaz on a threshing floor typing
[1:09:57] the holy spirit
[1:10:01] showing that the holy spirit is here to
[1:10:03] separate chaff and nature's away from us
[1:10:06] so that only our reality is able to
[1:10:09] stand
[1:10:10] is that right
[1:10:13] so on the threshing floor
[1:10:16] was as where your earthly dna
[1:10:20] is removed off of you
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:24] and the seventh seal dna comes into
[1:10:27] reality foam
[1:10:31] are you with me so far amen
[1:10:34] praise the lord because the devil don't
[1:10:35] like this stuff
[1:10:38] it's going to get real hard
[1:10:41] you know i actually feel sorry for the
[1:10:43] devil at the moment what's coming
[1:10:47] now
[1:10:51] on and the jebusite wanted to give david
[1:10:56] that land free
[1:10:59] but david said no i'm going to pay for
[1:11:00] it
[1:11:01] amen
[1:11:03] now the reason why he paid for it
[1:11:06] was because if he didn't pay for it
[1:11:09] ornan could come back and make a claim
[1:11:11] on that land
[1:11:14] is that right
[1:11:16] so anything that's not paid for
[1:11:21] the enemy can make a claim on it
[1:11:25] and if a person's sins have not been
[1:11:27] saved they've not been saved from their
[1:11:29] sins the devil can make a claim upon you
[1:11:36] so now whoever pays for something
[1:11:39] it belongs to the redeemer of that land
[1:11:44] and the redeemer of that land has his
[1:11:47] right to do what he wants with anything
[1:11:49] that he's redeemed
[1:11:54] now if you claim
[1:11:56] to have been bought by the blood of
[1:11:58] jesus christ
[1:12:00] and you still
[1:12:03] want
[1:12:04] what has been
[1:12:06] added
[1:12:07] if you claim to be bought by the blood
[1:12:09] of jesus and you still want to have your
[1:12:10] own life
[1:12:12] then your testimony is false
[1:12:18] if it's not paid for
[1:12:21] the previous owner can come back and
[1:12:23] make a stake a claim upon you
[1:12:27] next one please brothers
[1:12:30] now
[1:12:33] the revelation in heaven went from a
[1:12:35] tabernacle
[1:12:37] to a temple
[1:12:41] but it must end up in a man
[1:12:45] now jesus has come on the scene to give
[1:12:48] more revelation
[1:12:50] to what moses saw that's right amen
[1:12:56] and he says
[1:12:59] oh it's going working now that's good
[1:13:02] now watch now the words
[1:13:05] it's just a foundation
[1:13:10] then jesus answered the jews and said
[1:13:11] what sign show us thou unto us seeing
[1:13:14] that thou dost these things and jesus
[1:13:16] answered and said unto them destroy this
[1:13:18] temple
[1:13:20] in three days i will raise it up
[1:13:24] and they were listening
[1:13:26] and they were not listening
[1:13:28] by revelation
[1:13:33] then said the jews 46 years was this
[1:13:35] temple in building and will you roar it
[1:13:37] up in three days but he speaks spake of
[1:13:40] the temple of his body
[1:13:42] now as the revelation of the temple
[1:13:45] proceeds
[1:13:46] the previous has no longer any emphasis
[1:13:51] that's right
[1:13:52] okay
[1:13:54] now jesus himself
[1:13:57] he was the temple
[1:14:01] he was the real high priest
[1:14:04] he was the real sacrifice
[1:14:07] but this temple could not be put into
[1:14:10] action until it had had been anointed by
[1:14:14] a prophet
[1:14:17] so when jesus went down to the jordan
[1:14:20] river
[1:14:21] there was a prophet
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] he washed the high priest
[1:14:30] he washed him as the sacrifice and in
[1:14:33] the presence of that prophet the dove of
[1:14:35] the holy ghost down came down to set
[1:14:37] that temple into service
[1:14:43] a prophet
[1:14:44] anointed
[1:14:46] that temple that's right amen
[1:14:50] now
[1:14:50] watch now
[1:14:53] jesus is in a junction of time this is
[1:14:55] coming it's going to get really
[1:14:57] it's going to be such a blessing to you
[1:14:59] to understand who you are amen
[1:15:03] now jesus himself he's the temple
[1:15:09] now remember
[1:15:11] the temple solomon built
[1:15:14] had had more information
[1:15:16] it had stones to make that temple
[1:15:20] that was not when the tabernacle was
[1:15:22] being built the tabernacle was moving
[1:15:25] but the temple was built on a hill as it
[1:15:28] became a city
[1:15:31] okay
[1:15:33] more information is coming
[1:15:35] so here comes jesus and jesus is a city
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:40] he's the light of the city
[1:15:42] he's a priest he is melchizedek
[1:15:46] he's a sacrifice he's the lamb of god
[1:15:51] he's the vessels
[1:15:53] all in one man
[1:15:58] he's a stone
[1:16:00] he's a
[1:16:01] headstone he is the future capstone
[1:16:04] all in
[1:16:05] one man
[1:16:07] amen
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:11] so now from the vision that moses saw in
[1:16:13] heaven it's now unfolding itself into a
[1:16:17] man
[1:16:18] and that one man has everything that was
[1:16:21] in the temple inside of himself
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:25] that's right amen but the mystery of the
[1:16:27] temple could not remain as
[1:16:30] one man
[1:16:34] amen amen
[1:16:36] this is scary for the devil
[1:16:40] glory the female part had to come forth
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:45] hey matt
[1:16:47] now watch now as we still building up
[1:16:53] the believer comes becomes the temple
[1:16:55] with all the additions
[1:17:01] now watch this thing
[1:17:06] this is in the book of acts
[1:17:09] but solomon built him in house
[1:17:12] however the most high dwelleth not in
[1:17:14] temples made with hands
[1:17:16] as south the prophet in other words the
[1:17:18] vision in heaven
[1:17:20] was not to read to be remaining in a
[1:17:23] tabernacle and a temple amen that's
[1:17:26] right
[1:17:27] he said heaven is my throne
[1:17:31] the earth is my footstool
[1:17:33] what house will you build for me
[1:17:38] saith the lord what is the place of my
[1:17:40] rest
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] but he said heaven is my throne the
[1:17:45] earth is my footstool
[1:17:48] and when you have a footstool
[1:17:50] everything comes under dominion
[1:17:54] of your by your feet the way you walk
[1:18:00] now this temple
[1:18:02] that jesus was was not made
[1:18:05] by hands
[1:18:08] but there must be a conclusion
[1:18:11] to the vision in heaven
[1:18:16] where is the place of my rest
[1:18:19] when all earthly things are going to be
[1:18:21] my footstool
[1:18:24] where is the place of my rest in
[1:18:26] laodicea
[1:18:28] where there's got to be a temple of
[1:18:30] human beings that put everything under
[1:18:33] their feet
[1:18:37] so a footstool is where you take
[1:18:39] possession over all things
[1:18:42] to be conquered
[1:18:45] a footstool of satanic influence
[1:18:49] of the sickness of sickness of legacy of
[1:18:52] all things that came from the fall that
[1:18:54] bind us down of insecurities complexes
[1:18:58] jealousies envying and strife
[1:19:02] where is the temple
[1:19:04] on earth to make those things their
[1:19:07] footstool
[1:19:08] hallelujah
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:12] come on here we are
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:17] watching this the statue of a perfect
[1:19:19] man
[1:19:21] remember
[1:19:22] what was in the lord's prayer
[1:19:24] let it be done on earth as it is in
[1:19:26] heaven
[1:19:28] let it be done on earth
[1:19:31] as it is in heaven amen
[1:19:33] let this
[1:19:34] be a parallel to what is in heaven amen
[1:19:37] is that right
[1:19:39] now watch what brother brad says statue
[1:19:40] of a perfect man now god of the bible
[1:19:43] said that stephen spoke of solomon
[1:19:44] building a temple and the most high
[1:19:46] don't dwell in temples made with hands
[1:19:48] for heaven is my throne the earth is my
[1:19:50] footstool but a body has thou prepared
[1:19:52] me amen there you are a body has thou
[1:19:55] prepared me god dwells in the statue of
[1:19:57] man reflecting himself into that being
[1:20:00] we are
[1:20:01] to be one for him the heavenly vision to
[1:20:04] reflect
[1:20:05] through
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:08] god in us being his tabernacle god
[1:20:11] manifesting
[1:20:13] god has always at all time reflected
[1:20:15] himself
[1:20:17] and man
[1:20:19] now let's just go a little bit further
[1:20:20] there's only a platform now
[1:20:28] now apostle paul
[1:20:31] a messenger
[1:20:33] anointing a church
[1:20:36] one corinthians 6 19 what know you not
[1:20:38] that your body is the temple of the holy
[1:20:40] ghost which is which is in you which you
[1:20:42] have you have of god and you are and you
[1:20:45] are
[1:20:46] not your own that's right
[1:20:50] for your bought with a price therefore
[1:20:51] glorify god in your body and in your
[1:20:54] spirit now where is the biggest problems
[1:20:56] that we have in laodicea
[1:20:59] and our body
[1:21:00] and our human spirit
[1:21:05] that's right that right
[1:21:07] but he said glorify god in your body and
[1:21:10] in your human spirit because when he
[1:21:11] says the spirit is not talking about the
[1:21:13] holy spirit that's right your spirit yes
[1:21:15] that's right amen
[1:21:17] and then he says
[1:21:20] and here's the apostle paul two thousand
[1:21:21] years ago prophesying and the people are
[1:21:23] listening to him and they don't even
[1:21:24] know what he's talking about
[1:21:29] romans 16 verse 20 and the god of peace
[1:21:31] shall brew satan under
[1:21:34] your feet
[1:21:35] shortly
[1:21:37] but not back then
[1:21:42] shortly means sometime in the future
[1:21:46] at the end time
[1:21:48] the true temples at the end time are
[1:21:50] going to put all things under their feet
[1:21:56] believe it
[1:21:59] praise the lord
[1:22:04] what are you as god sees you
[1:22:07] you see brothers and sisters we're in a
[1:22:09] serious time
[1:22:11] and i'm going to show you very soon
[1:22:13] shockingly
[1:22:14] how probably 95
[1:22:17] of people in this message have got a
[1:22:19] wrong
[1:22:20] concept
[1:22:23] on what god says
[1:22:26] they've got they have actually blown it
[1:22:29] and we need to shake ourselves
[1:22:32] because we are living in a time
[1:22:35] you cannot live beneath your privileges
[1:22:41] it will be brother
[1:22:43] now
[1:22:44] what are you as god sees you
[1:22:47] now watch now apostle paul says 2000
[1:22:49] years ago for now we see through a glass
[1:22:51] darkly but then face to face now i know
[1:22:54] in part for seven church ages i know in
[1:22:56] part i'm looking through the glass
[1:22:57] darkly but right at the end time
[1:23:00] but then i shall know even as i am known
[1:23:06] watch now sorry
[1:23:08] as the scriptures unfold
[1:23:12] these multiple temples
[1:23:17] now the book of matthew he says here
[1:23:21] you are the light of the world a city
[1:23:24] i am a city yes i am yes
[1:23:27] amen amen
[1:23:28] sit on a hill that cannot be hit
[1:23:31] this city you do not hide it somewhere
[1:23:34] you don't hide it in the bedroom
[1:23:37] you don't go and hide it or you know
[1:23:39] this city must be seen
[1:23:44] now watch how he's unfolding some things
[1:23:46] in that he's typing the old testament
[1:23:49] temple and he's bringing it into you
[1:23:53] and he says if any man purge himself
[1:23:55] from these things he shall be a vessel
[1:23:58] oh i'm a vessel
[1:24:00] i'm one of the furnitures in the temple
[1:24:03] i'm a vessel in the temple
[1:24:05] that right
[1:24:08] then in one peter two verse five he says
[1:24:10] you're lively stones
[1:24:12] i'm a stone in the temple
[1:24:16] but where was i cut
[1:24:18] to be a stone in this temple at the end
[1:24:20] time
[1:24:21] i was cut in a quiet place making a
[1:24:25] noise somewhere over there and then
[1:24:27] brought it brought at the right time
[1:24:28] into a place where i could be useful
[1:24:30] into the hands of god i am a stone you
[1:24:33] are a stone you're a vessel you are a
[1:24:36] city
[1:24:38] is that right
[1:24:40] build up a spiritual house and a holy
[1:24:42] priesthood i am a priesthood
[1:24:45] a priest can go right into the presence
[1:24:48] of god
[1:24:50] oh thank you lord that's fine
[1:24:53] i am a stone
[1:24:55] i'm a vessel i am a city
[1:24:58] all in one person
[1:25:00] amen is that right yes
[1:25:02] and i can offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:25:05] yes
[1:25:07] praise the lord
[1:25:09] the devil don't want you to know these
[1:25:10] things now because we can say amen but
[1:25:13] what do we do when we're not here
[1:25:19] so now we'll just go i'll just flick
[1:25:21] this through a couple of more we have
[1:25:22] already done that one so now the elect
[1:25:27] the person
[1:25:28] the individual
[1:25:30] is the true city
[1:25:32] the new jerusalem
[1:25:34] the real temple of god
[1:25:37] the stones of the temple
[1:25:40] the vessels in the temple
[1:25:42] the real priesthood
[1:25:44] and the offerer of spiritual sacrifices
[1:25:48] all in one person that's right
[1:25:51] hey man
[1:25:58] so now here's this temple
[1:26:01] you are it
[1:26:04] you're all that
[1:26:09] now
[1:26:13] we're going to look at this picture now
[1:26:19] there is all the things that went in the
[1:26:20] natural temple
[1:26:28] there was there
[1:26:31] all of these
[1:26:33] things
[1:26:34] was in that temple that had to be
[1:26:37] anointed
[1:26:38] by a prophet
[1:26:42] all these things was spread out amongst
[1:26:45] this
[1:26:46] man-made temple
[1:26:50] there was a road priesthood and he
[1:26:51] wasn't interceding there was a labor
[1:26:54] washed by the water of the word and
[1:26:55] here's the incense which is the prayers
[1:26:57] of the saints being offered up all in a
[1:26:59] temple
[1:27:02] there was this basin for the uh the oil
[1:27:04] there was this um
[1:27:08] what thing for carrying wine what is
[1:27:09] wine in this day stimulation by the
[1:27:12] revelation of the word of god is that
[1:27:14] right
[1:27:17] we have this prophetic light within us
[1:27:19] we have the throne of god in our hearts
[1:27:21] is that right
[1:27:24] but do we know it
[1:27:30] and we have this
[1:27:34] and inside this
[1:27:36] is a treasure
[1:27:38] and an earthen vessel
[1:27:41] now
[1:27:47] the temple and the vessels had to be
[1:27:49] anointed by a prophet
[1:27:53] and if there was no prophet
[1:27:55] to anoint the temple
[1:27:58] then there was no life going to come to
[1:28:00] the temple
[1:28:02] and this is why you are a privileged
[1:28:04] people
[1:28:06] because you received a prophet that
[1:28:08] brought forth a word that was able to
[1:28:10] anoint you
[1:28:11] and if you receive that word that
[1:28:13] anointing it puts you into service
[1:28:16] and that but it must be recognized
[1:28:19] because the one thing that satan does
[1:28:21] not want you to be able to do is to
[1:28:24] start making claims on what you are
[1:28:30] so now i'm just trying to get
[1:28:34] to where we're going to start off this
[1:28:35] morning
[1:28:37] now in the old testament this is what
[1:28:39] moses had to do
[1:28:42] you shall make
[1:28:44] now moses had to anoint his vessels the
[1:28:47] ark and everything
[1:28:49] you shall make it an oil of a holy
[1:28:50] ointment and ointment compound after the
[1:28:52] art of the apothecary it shall be unholy
[1:28:54] anointing oil and you shall anoint the
[1:28:56] tabernacle of the congregation there
[1:28:58] with and the ark of the testimony and
[1:29:00] the table and all his vessels
[1:29:03] it looks as this word his
[1:29:06] and the candlestick in all his vessels
[1:29:07] and the altar of incense and the ultra
[1:29:10] of burnt offering with his vessels and
[1:29:11] the lava and his foot
[1:29:14] then he goes on and you should take the
[1:29:16] anointing oh and anoint the tabernacle
[1:29:19] and all that is therein and you shall
[1:29:20] hallow it and all the vessels thereof
[1:29:22] and it shall be holy and you should take
[1:29:23] the anoint the altar of the burnt
[1:29:25] offering and all his vessels
[1:29:27] and you shall anoint the labour and his
[1:29:29] foot and and so on and so on that's
[1:29:32] right
[1:29:33] so now
[1:29:35] all these things that you saw in the old
[1:29:37] testament
[1:29:39] temple
[1:29:41] all these things
[1:29:44] accumulates
[1:29:46] into one person
[1:29:50] but what was your opening scripture
[1:29:55] when you fall into problems
[1:29:59] what do you look to
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:07] now
[1:30:09] we're going to go to a certain place now
[1:30:15] we're going to clip down so i just got
[1:30:17] to squeeze this in
[1:30:21] the hidden manner in an earthen vessel
[1:30:24] now
[1:30:26] brother bradley was preaching the
[1:30:27] contest in 1962
[1:30:31] and he says some startling things that
[1:30:34] people missed it
[1:30:36] and he says make us fit servants forgive
[1:30:38] our past bless our future guide us o
[1:30:40] lord god with thy mighty hand jehovah
[1:30:42] bless these ministers here bless all the
[1:30:44] laity and all the visitors be thou with
[1:30:46] us lord we are your servants and we give
[1:30:48] ourselves holy to you for 1963 that the
[1:30:51] power of your spirit may have more
[1:30:53] preeminences in our life
[1:30:56] now if if you didn't know what the
[1:30:58] rapture cycle was you wouldn't know what
[1:31:01] he was saying
[1:31:02] because what is the rapture cycle
[1:31:04] he reveals himself as the son of man
[1:31:09] with a shout
[1:31:10] is that right
[1:31:11] and then after that shout comes forth he
[1:31:14] has to get preeminences over the
[1:31:16] believer
[1:31:18] and then once he's got preeminences over
[1:31:20] the believer then he can change the body
[1:31:24] but if he hasn't got preeminences over
[1:31:26] the believer he cannot change the body
[1:31:30] because this must reflect a heavenly
[1:31:33] vision amen because as the vision came
[1:31:36] down from heaven to moses at the end
[1:31:39] time it takes those that are the temple
[1:31:41] back to eternity again
[1:31:44] because remember it comes from heaven
[1:31:46] down through time then back to eternity
[1:31:49] again
[1:31:50] amen that's right amen
[1:31:53] said help us god forgive us and help us
[1:31:56] we pray raise up mighty men raise up
[1:31:58] mighty warriors of the faith open this
[1:32:00] year lord the hidden manner that rock
[1:32:02] beneath the rock
[1:32:06] that we may see the program of god
[1:32:10] kept off the pyramids of our lives
[1:32:14] put the capstone jesus christ upon every
[1:32:18] one of us
[1:32:22] now
[1:32:24] we'll go and we'll look at this now amen
[1:32:30] for god has who commanded the light to
[1:32:32] shine out of darkness has shined in our
[1:32:34] hearts to give the light of the
[1:32:35] knowledge of the glory of god in the
[1:32:36] face of jesus but we have this treasure
[1:32:39] in earthen vessels
[1:32:42] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:32:44] of god and not of us
[1:32:47] so we have this treasure and earthly
[1:32:48] vessels
[1:32:50] so inside of your earthly
[1:32:52] vessel god has placed a treasure there
[1:32:56] that must come into expression amen
[1:33:00] now you have no value
[1:33:04] for something to be a treasure there is
[1:33:06] value put upon it
[1:33:11] that treasure in you must give honor to
[1:33:13] god but what is that treasure
[1:33:16] now we go back to the old testament
[1:33:18] again
[1:33:21] don't worry if you're not getting all
[1:33:22] this you will
[1:33:25] jeremiah
[1:33:29] thus says the lord god of host the god
[1:33:30] of israel take these evidences this
[1:33:32] evidence of the purchase which is sealed
[1:33:34] and this evidence which is open open and

[1:33:48] gabriel's instructions he says

[1:34:06] kept in an earthen vessel shows where
[1:34:09] the power of god and the scrolls and the
[1:34:11] secrets of god is known in the heart
[1:34:14] he says our our plan of redemption that
[1:34:16] same being kept in earthen vessels jesus
[1:34:19] name and the revelation
[1:34:21] so now
[1:34:22] in the old testament
[1:34:25] was in the temple an earthen vessel
[1:34:29] but now this earthen vessel becomes us
[1:34:33] and inside of us
[1:34:36] and the earth and vessel
[1:34:40] is a revelation
[1:34:43] of
[1:34:44] ourselves a revelation of your reality
[1:34:48] amen and how god brought a message to
[1:34:51] you to bring down your six seals of your
[1:34:54] earthly lineage and bring you up into
[1:34:56] your eternal representation thank you
[1:34:59] lord
[1:35:00] we believe it
[1:35:01] now we're in a junction time
[1:35:06] we and i
[1:35:07] laid the seer is mystery babylon okay
[1:35:11] now watch
[1:35:15] you are seeing in the news worldwide
[1:35:18] the whole human race turned completely
[1:35:21] insane that's right
[1:35:24] the whole human race has moved into
[1:35:26] total insanity that's right
[1:35:28] they don't even know the difference
[1:35:30] between a male and a female they're that
[1:35:31] stupid
[1:35:33] that's just stupid
[1:35:36] but
[1:35:39] this world systems is on the verge of
[1:35:42] total collapse
[1:35:45] something's causing it
[1:35:48] now we're not going to get and i'm going
[1:35:50] to show you some things
[1:35:52] now
[1:35:55] in the old testament
[1:35:58] when the children of israel
[1:36:00] were captured and taken into babylon
[1:36:04] they were down there 70 years is that
[1:36:06] right
[1:36:09] and they took and they dismantled the
[1:36:11] temple and took it and took all the
[1:36:14] furnitures down into babylon
[1:36:18] they took the priesthood into babylon
[1:36:22] they took the candlesticks into babylon
[1:36:24] they took all the furniture into babylon
[1:36:26] and they took the vessels into babylon
[1:36:32] but you watch what's happening to the
[1:36:33] world now
[1:36:37] they are trying to put
[1:36:41] babylonian influence
[1:36:44] into god's vessels
[1:36:47] now when beltish has ah
[1:36:51] his kingdom was coming to an end
[1:36:55] so those babylonians went
[1:36:57] and got some temp some vessels that have
[1:37:02] been anointed by a prophet
[1:37:07] and tried to put babylonian drunkenness
[1:37:11] into those vessels oh god have mercy
[1:37:15] they're right
[1:37:18] and right at the time
[1:37:21] when they were trying to put drunkenness
[1:37:23] into those
[1:37:25] vessels that were anointed by a prophet
[1:37:28] god was raising up cyrus
[1:37:32] the bear
[1:37:44] i am so amazed how many people in the
[1:37:46] message
[1:37:48] look at world events and they haven't
[1:37:50] got a cotton-picking understanding of
[1:37:52] what's going on worldwide
[1:37:57] how many people
[1:37:59] you hear going on about oh look what
[1:38:02] russia is doing don't you know the
[1:38:04] prophecy in the bible
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:09] it's true
[1:38:10] even ministers going on about oh was it
[1:38:12] so awful what russia is doing is that
[1:38:14] right russia's fulfilling what a prophet
[1:38:17] said they would do
[1:38:20] now watch now
[1:38:22] these things
[1:38:32] remember that babylon was destroyed by
[1:38:34] the meads and the persians is that right
[1:38:37] and they are tight there's the bear
[1:38:39] that's right
[1:38:41] babylon was the lion the beast and the
[1:38:42] persians the bear greeks greece was a
[1:38:44] leopard and rome was a dragon
[1:38:46] the bear is always raised up to destroy
[1:38:49] babalon
[1:38:52] amen yes
[1:38:54] so here we see it in the image that
[1:38:57] daniel saw
[1:39:00] the lion the bear the leopard and the
[1:39:01] dragon
[1:39:04] but the time when that babylonian empire
[1:39:06] came to an end was at a junction when
[1:39:09] they were trying to put drunkenness into
[1:39:12] vessels anointed by god
[1:39:17] amen
[1:39:19] and how many of us
[1:39:22] come under the influence of
[1:39:25] babylonianism and start agreeing with
[1:39:28] babylonian things that's coming over the
[1:39:30] news media
[1:39:32] and start to accept it as normal
[1:39:35] oh lord
[1:39:37] have mercy
[1:39:39] amen amen
[1:39:44] now watch
[1:39:48] in 1960 i think it was
[1:39:51] this
[1:39:52] great thing happened
[1:39:55] i preached this last three weeks ago in
[1:39:58] our church
[1:39:59] and i was so staggered by how many in
[1:40:01] the message haven't even seen the thing
[1:40:03] what's going on in the world right now
[1:40:06] in 1963 only one man on the earth knew
[1:40:09] what that was a sign of
[1:40:12] amen
[1:40:13] when a russian president hit his shoe
[1:40:17] upon the podium at the united nations
[1:40:19] only one man on the earth knew
[1:40:25] and this man was putting his shoe on the
[1:40:27] podium and all these ignorant serpent
[1:40:30] seed leaders
[1:40:32] looked
[1:40:34] yeah and i thought what a stupid man
[1:40:35] hitting us
[1:40:37] they didn't even know he was fulfilling
[1:40:39] what daniel said was going to happen at
[1:40:41] the end time to show this is the time of
[1:40:44] the feat at the free time of the image
[1:40:46] that daniel saw
[1:40:48] one man knew it
[1:40:50] one
[1:40:51] man
[1:40:53] who looked
[1:40:54] at to the scriptures of daniel and
[1:40:57] placed the activity and says this is
[1:40:59] that that was spoken by daniel that's
[1:41:01] right man
[1:41:09] this went over the internet
[1:41:11] all over the world i put it together
[1:41:13] three weeks ago and everyone stole it
[1:41:14] but never mind
[1:41:17] sure
[1:41:19] has ex-russian president medvedev
[1:41:22] prophesy
[1:41:25] and he doesn't even know why he's saying
[1:41:26] it
[1:41:29] and he's quoting the sixth seal to the
[1:41:30] united states and nato
[1:41:33] he said we're going to destroy you
[1:41:35] oh my god
[1:41:38] wow
[1:41:39] he's quoting the sixth seal
[1:41:43] to all these leaders of the world
[1:41:46] amen and they look
[1:41:49] and they can't see that scriptures have
[1:41:51] been fulfilled right before their eyes
[1:41:53] that's right
[1:41:54] he says the us and its worthless lap dog
[1:41:57] do i like the way this man talks man
[1:42:00] i just love that that's that's my kind
[1:42:02] of talk you know
[1:42:05] worthless lap dogs those bunch of
[1:42:08] worthless useless european prime
[1:42:11] ministers and presidents useless
[1:42:13] worthless lap dogs must remember the
[1:42:15] words of the scripture
[1:42:18] judge not that you be not judged for
[1:42:21] with what judgment you judge you shall
[1:42:23] be judged
[1:42:25] this is a heathen man
[1:42:29] quoting scriptures then he goes into the
[1:42:31] sixth seal
[1:42:33] for the great day of his wrath has come
[1:42:35] and who can withstand it
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:40] wow hallelujah
[1:42:43] amen wow he's declaring to babylon
[1:42:46] we're going to destroy you wow
[1:42:53] is that right amen
[1:42:57] and it's happening right in front of
[1:42:58] your eyes in world events
[1:43:00] and you should know these things if you
[1:43:03] have read what a prophet said was going
[1:43:05] to happen at the end time
[1:43:08] and message people go on
[1:43:11] the usual day
[1:43:13] thinking about all the extra dollars
[1:43:14] they can make
[1:43:16] and not knowing that prophecy is coming
[1:43:17] to pass
[1:43:19] right in front of your eyes
[1:43:25] the government of russia banned all
[1:43:27] sodomite laws you are not allowed to
[1:43:29] make yourself anything more than a male
[1:43:31] or female
[1:43:35] to show and bring a rebuke to the west
[1:43:39] that has corrupted the whole world
[1:43:41] that's right
[1:43:42] yeah right
[1:43:48] now we're going to go into the subject
[1:43:50] now
[1:43:51] i just put that as a platform there okay
[1:43:54] awesome
[1:43:55] this is where satan really gets us
[1:43:57] hiding
[1:44:00] give it to him right
[1:44:01] now who are you
[1:44:03] amen the temple
[1:44:07] are you all the vessels and everything
[1:44:09] that was in shadow form in you is that
[1:44:11] right amen
[1:44:13] then don't ever deny that in your life
[1:44:17] because you'll be
[1:44:18] defeated every single day of your life
[1:44:22] now i stand here no different to you i
[1:44:24] get every every temptation you get i get
[1:44:27] that's right i am not superman
[1:44:33] i suffer everything that you suffer
[1:44:36] see i'm not one step better than any of
[1:44:39] you
[1:44:40] you don't want to see what look i did
[1:44:42] something i spent years of my life
[1:44:45] overseas
[1:44:47] the devil cannot get me with money woman
[1:44:49] or popularity
[1:44:51] but by gummy tries
[1:44:55] see
[1:44:56] he tries
[1:44:59] now
[1:45:07] we're just going to skip some things
[1:45:10] now there are various forms of attack
[1:45:12] that he's that he takes
[1:45:15] has it go with
[1:45:18] he tries to conform you to the realm of
[1:45:20] bodily afflictions
[1:45:22] is that right
[1:45:25] now right now rome
[1:45:28] controls using four things
[1:45:31] wars
[1:45:33] famines
[1:45:34] diseases and beasts of the earth
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:40] but when you mention the word
[1:45:42] diseases everybody goes quiet
[1:45:47] but rome's behind it all
[1:45:49] amen
[1:45:51] now what rome does
[1:45:53] it creates a scenario
[1:45:57] traps you into it
[1:46:00] then blames you for it
[1:46:03] now
[1:46:04] let's go into the political world
[1:46:07] who made the war in the ukraine
[1:46:11] was it russia
[1:46:13] was the vatican using the united states
[1:46:14] of america and nato
[1:46:16] they provoked and provoked and provoked
[1:46:19] they are creating something russia goes
[1:46:21] in to defend themselves then they go and
[1:46:22] blame russia for starting the war
[1:46:25] right
[1:46:26] russia never started anything
[1:46:29] they're defending themselves
[1:46:31] so in your humanity
[1:46:33] he sets up scenarios to trap you
[1:46:37] you get trapped
[1:46:39] he blames you then he wants you to
[1:46:41] accept what you've been trapped into as
[1:46:43] real
[1:46:49] so in the lowest realm
[1:46:52] he's tries to conform you to the realm
[1:46:54] of bodily afflictions the next realm
[1:46:56] higher he's using mind paralyzing
[1:46:58] narratives and the next realm higher
[1:47:00] he's trying to get you by ref by having
[1:47:04] you not identify yourself as god sees
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:10] now this is where
[1:47:13] the bit that i'm going to enjoy
[1:47:19] in 1995 i was in egypt
[1:47:24] and i took some six other people with me
[1:47:26] to egypt on a tour
[1:47:28] i took them to the pyramids and into
[1:47:30] then i took them into israel
[1:47:33] so
[1:47:34] there was myself and you know six other
[1:47:36] kiwi brethren and
[1:47:40] the others went uh we were we had to go
[1:47:43] from cairo to where the pyramids were in
[1:47:45] the desert
[1:47:48] now i was warmed
[1:47:52] out in the desert as hawkers
[1:47:54] a hawker is a person who's a liar and a
[1:47:57] deceiver and a thief you're like a car
[1:47:59] dealer basically these people
[1:48:02] these people get stolen goods and they
[1:48:04] try to go and rip a tourist off
[1:48:08] right
[1:48:10] and so these people
[1:48:12] they hide behind rocks
[1:48:14] watching the tourists come out and then
[1:48:16] they step out and try to rip you off
[1:48:19] now there's some good egyptians okay not
[1:48:20] just the ones in the in the red sea
[1:48:23] there are some good egyptians
[1:48:28] so now
[1:48:30] i've been warned
[1:48:32] watch out for the hawkers
[1:48:34] so i'm walking along the others are
[1:48:36] riding camels like that you know these
[1:48:38] these arabs come out and you pay a
[1:48:40] dollar or something i'm saying it's more
[1:48:42] than that
[1:48:43] your mother was there that's right your
[1:48:45] mum was there
[1:48:47] so while they were riding camels i'm
[1:48:49] walking around minding my business
[1:48:52] and out from the rocks
[1:48:54] pops a hawker
[1:48:58] and what he what he does
[1:49:00] he throws something on the ground in
[1:49:02] front of him well we'll just we'll put
[1:49:03] it like this
[1:49:04] throws her on the ground in front of me
[1:49:06] like this
[1:49:08] just pick it up
[1:49:11] it's yours it's free no i know he's a
[1:49:13] lying help
[1:49:15] okay
[1:49:16] he keeps on going pick it up
[1:49:19] it's yours it's free
[1:49:21] there's nothing free in the middle east
[1:49:26] now i'm good for a go you know i've
[1:49:28] always been good for a go
[1:49:30] he keeps on saying it
[1:49:34] pick it up
[1:49:36] it's yours it's free
[1:49:39] so i'm thinking mate
[1:49:41] i know this guy's a crook
[1:49:44] and i'm looking at this
[1:49:46] this trinket he's just thrown on the
[1:49:48] ground just throwing it in front of me
[1:49:49] about a meter in front of me i'm looking
[1:49:50] at this i'm looking at this guy
[1:49:53] and i think mate i wonder what'll happen
[1:49:55] if i pick it up
[1:49:59] says it pick it up it's yours it's free
[1:50:02] so i said i'm good for a go man
[1:50:07] so i picked it up
[1:50:09] and i picked it up and the guy was on to
[1:50:11] me he says i want this match and i want
[1:50:13] this match and i want this for this and
[1:50:14] i want you to sell i want to sell you
[1:50:16] this and this guy was on and on and i
[1:50:18] said i thought you said it was free
[1:50:22] when i picked it up
[1:50:25] i made a contract with that man without
[1:50:27] knowing it
[1:50:32] and that guy was on to me
[1:50:36] pick it up it's free i picked it up now
[1:50:37] it's no it's no longer free
[1:50:41] and i had
[1:50:42] unwittingly entered into a contract with
[1:50:46] that man
[1:50:49] and as long as i held that in my hand
[1:50:53] i was obligated to that man
[1:50:56] and i was holding that thing and man i
[1:50:59] can get stewed up
[1:51:02] and as long as i was holding that in my
[1:51:04] hand that guy was taunting me
[1:51:07] i want this much i want you to pay this
[1:51:09] much for that he's going on and on and
[1:51:12] on and on
[1:51:14] and it would go from one thing to
[1:51:16] another
[1:51:19] to that man
[1:51:22] i'd made a deal with him when i held
[1:51:24] that in my hand
[1:51:26] see
[1:51:29] then i got so brassed off
[1:51:32] i threw the thing on the ground
[1:51:36] and walked away
[1:51:39] and after i threw it on the ground he
[1:51:41] was cursing me and carrying on and using
[1:51:43] every profanity and calling my mother
[1:51:45] and all sorts of things and you know he
[1:51:47] was just going for it
[1:51:49] but i was no longer holding it amen
[1:51:53] see i was no longer holding it
[1:51:56] now
[1:51:57] he could only just curse at me you know
[1:51:59] i'm used to people cursing at me that
[1:52:00] doesn't worry me
[1:52:05] i just kept walking to the pyramids and
[1:52:07] he was cursing away
[1:52:10] but i was no longer holding the object
[1:52:16] now i hope you got this now
[1:52:20] now we've got to try and find a balance
[1:52:22] in all these things
[1:52:26] trying to find a balance
[1:52:28] now if you can get this thing in the
[1:52:29] disease realm
[1:52:31] you'll get it in every realm
[1:52:34] amen
[1:52:38] all diseases we know are of the devil is
[1:52:40] that right
[1:52:41] they are fallen angels sickness can be
[1:52:44] permitted of the lord to keep a person
[1:52:46] the lord uses in full submission like
[1:52:48] paul and brother branham they you know
[1:52:50] apostle paul was given a
[1:52:52] a a uh
[1:52:54] a demon on him
[1:52:56] but affected his eyesight so that god
[1:52:58] could keep him in his hands brother
[1:53:00] barron had that black thing in his
[1:53:01] stomach to keep him in his hands to keep
[1:53:03] him in god's hands
[1:53:06] sickness can be used by the lord for
[1:53:07] character building chastisement or
[1:53:09] showing mercy
[1:53:10] or to prove your faith but also then
[1:53:14] not connected with that a sickness and
[1:53:16] disease can be satan directly trying to
[1:53:18] hinder the work of the lord and fighting
[1:53:20] against your calling
[1:53:23] amen
[1:53:24] or satan trying to defeat you and take
[1:53:26] your life before your time
[1:53:32] now
[1:53:38] i'm just trying to get so that this
[1:53:39] doesn't go on for hours i want to get to
[1:53:40] a certain spot
[1:53:46] now one night
[1:53:47] i was watching i was
[1:53:50] you know when a minister gets a sermon
[1:53:52] god puts him through things to give him
[1:53:54] something to direct his thoughts with
[1:53:57] i was watching all the people in the
[1:53:59] message
[1:54:01] getting sick
[1:54:05] this
[1:54:06] virus thing that was going on around the
[1:54:08] place
[1:54:09] and i was watching them i think man
[1:54:11] what's going on here
[1:54:15] then one night at 12 o'clock i woke up
[1:54:18] and i saw myself saying these words they
[1:54:22] are nothing but lying vanities
[1:54:28] they're nothing but lying vanities
[1:54:32] and then i decided that i would go the

[2:03:55] do nothing with you the moment you throw

[2:04:04] overseas
[2:04:07] i will not identify where and who
[2:04:10] i'll pick this thing up not to get it
[2:04:13] this brother
[2:04:15] was cooking outside he had
[2:04:18] a barbecue
[2:04:20] that was like yours brother andy with
[2:04:22] all the flames coming in
[2:04:26] and he was cooking something in a
[2:04:28] stainless steel pot
[2:04:31] and the handle of the pot
[2:04:34] was accidentally over the flame
[2:04:37] coming up in this outside barbecue
[2:04:40] and he didn't know it
[2:04:43] and he didn't see that the handle had
[2:04:45] gone red hot
[2:04:48] this actually happened with witnesses
[2:04:51] so he goes and he and he's he's wanting
[2:04:53] to go and take the pot off and take out
[2:04:55] whatever's cooking in he puts his hand
[2:04:58] on it
[2:04:59] and it's red hot
[2:05:02] and it took all the skin off his hand to
[2:05:05] the bone
[2:05:08] you could see the bones
[2:05:11] in his hands
[2:05:15] now satan's watching him and saying come
[2:05:17] on
[2:05:18] say you got it say you got it
[2:05:22] this brother was a wise man
[2:05:25] he looked at those symptoms of this
[2:05:27] agony he is going through
[2:05:31] and the devil was trying to get him to
[2:05:33] agree you're wounded forever
[2:05:37] the symptom was wanting to become real
[2:05:39] to him
[2:05:40] so he said to the to the the devil you
[2:05:43] trapped me into this
[2:05:46] i'm not going to accept that jesus
[2:05:49] christ has healed me and before his eyes
[2:05:51] within 15 minutes it was in the scar on
[2:05:53] his hand
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] amen 15 minutes there was not a scar
[2:06:00] amen
[2:06:11] he wants to keep you down to say i've
[2:06:14] got this i'm no good i've got this
[2:06:17] problem i've got that problem if that
[2:06:19] was the case i'd never be in the pulpit
[2:06:20] ever
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:22] you know my testimony
[2:06:25] oh i can't speak i'm never going to be
[2:06:27] any good there's that and i had 34 years
[2:06:30] of that in my life
[2:06:31] until the lord told me got me to stop
[2:06:34] saying that i have this problem
[2:06:36] amen
[2:06:37] [Music]
[2:06:38] i agreed to a pack of symptoms in my
[2:06:41] life that wasn't even the truth
[2:06:43] and god had to shake that thing off me
[2:06:45] until i started to deny it and then god
[2:06:48] could deal with the symptoms that made
[2:06:50] me not be able to speak and he dealt
[2:06:52] with my mind he dealt with my body until
[2:06:54] now i can speak jesus
[2:06:58] that is the power of god
[2:07:01] when you start
[2:07:02] looking at your reality
[2:07:09] now watch it now
[2:07:12] the prophet says
[2:07:15] when you testify you still have your
[2:07:17] sickness the devil keeps it with you
[2:07:20] hey he keeps it you got it man
[2:07:26] say i won't have it no sir amen
[2:07:30] come now
[2:07:33] now watch
[2:07:35] then on the next paragraph he says give
[2:07:38] your faith a chance turn it loose
[2:07:39] unbridled let it work you've got it
[2:07:42] bound down with traditions
[2:07:45] traditions
[2:07:49] but the first time you testify your
[2:07:50] sickness it brings you right down to
[2:07:52] that realm again you signed for it
[2:07:55] what traditions the tradition of always
[2:07:57] listening to experts who are educated to
[2:07:59] pushing narratives
[2:08:01] amen
[2:08:02] the tradition of listening to negative
[2:08:04] comments on earthbound
[2:08:06] or calling the chipmunks in the message
[2:08:11] hey we're eagles are we we stop
[2:08:13] listening to a bunch of idiot chipmunks
[2:08:17] they're traditional being quick to say
[2:08:18] i'm sick by the way i feel i said to our
[2:08:21] church just because i got a headache
[2:08:23] don't mean to say i've got this this
[2:08:25] problem or that problem my mother-in-law
[2:08:26] gives me a headache that doesn't mean to
[2:08:28] say that i've got a disease
[2:08:36] i got a sore back i get that from
[2:08:37] getting the firewood in that don't mean
[2:08:39] to say i've got a disease amen
[2:08:42] yes

[2:09:47] not yours until you sign for them then
[2:09:49] you've received them and when you sign
[2:09:51] you receive them then they are yours
[2:09:54] the express company has to send them to
[2:09:56] the he says but if you refuse to sign
[2:09:58] for them he has to take them back to the
[2:10:00] express company the express company has
[2:10:02] to send them to the one that sent them
[2:10:04] to you is that right it goes right back

[2:10:24] have it refuse to have your sickness or
[2:10:26] arthritis whatever it is i just haven't
[2:10:28] got it by straight from here
[2:10:32] nothing but the truth
[2:10:34] it's the battle that we're in brothers
[2:10:35] and sisters
[2:10:38] praise the lord
[2:10:44] no it doesn't have to be a bodily
[2:10:45] disease you know we're living in this
[2:10:47] age and there's everything thrown at us
[2:10:50] you go on to google up something and
[2:10:52] there's something worrying not something
[2:10:54] and it's always these influences trying
[2:10:56] to calm upon you
[2:10:59] and it's trying to draw you in and draw
[2:11:02] you in
[2:11:03] hey
[2:11:04] if you're a normal human being it'll
[2:11:06] affect you if you look too long that's
[2:11:08] right
[2:11:10] he could be tempted to pick it up have a
[2:11:12] good look
[2:11:15] is that right
[2:11:18] a bad attitude is just a satanic symptom
[2:11:23] it's coming and you're feeling this way
[2:11:24] about a brother or sister and then and
[2:11:27] then suddenly you sign your name to that
[2:11:30] say i feel like that and i'm not
[2:11:32] changing now god can do nothing with you
[2:11:35] that's right that right
[2:11:40] then you live justifying yourself and
[2:11:42] all your actions that were once just
[2:11:45] symptoms
[2:11:48] i'm not coming to church anymore this
[2:11:50] person's done this to me i know what
[2:11:52] i'll do
[2:11:54] i'm going to justify myself i'm going to
[2:11:56] form a house group
[2:12:01] is that right
[2:12:03] that's people with an attitude problem
[2:12:10] and you sink into the world of your own
[2:12:12] self-importance
[2:12:16] right now let's turn to the book of joan
[2:12:18] i want to show you something
[2:12:22] hallelujah
[2:12:23] glory to the book of jonah
[2:12:26] chapter two
[2:12:29] we're going to finish up on this because
[2:12:30] i i can't go for five hours you know i
[2:12:32] just want to hit the high spots
[2:12:35] no no we just got to kill him quick andy
[2:12:37] [Laughter]
[2:12:40] kill him quick
[2:12:44] don't give him
[2:12:45] a long day just quick let's just deal
[2:12:47] with it
[2:12:49] now when you read the book of jonah
[2:12:51] brothers and sisters
[2:12:53] it's in the old testament is that right
[2:12:56] yes
[2:12:58] and it's a resurrection sign in the old
[2:13:00] testament
[2:13:01] that jesus comes along and fulfills that
[2:13:04] shadow form that jonah was doing in the
[2:13:07] old testament
[2:13:08] jonah was in the wales valley for three
[2:13:10] days within three days or three nights
[2:13:12] jesus comes along and he was in the
[2:13:14] grave within three days and three nights
[2:13:16] he resurrected out but then brother
[2:13:18] barum says he says that's the
[2:13:19] resurrection sign at the end time
[2:13:22] jonah is a sign for the end time
[2:13:24] making jesus christ the same yesterday
[2:13:26] today and forever
[2:13:28] now remember what is the rapture cycle a
[2:13:30] shout and a voice and a trumpet
[2:13:34] is that right
[2:13:35] now jonah types the bride
[2:13:38] he's cold
[2:13:41] to be a resurrection minister to a bunch
[2:13:43] of gentiles
[2:13:47] they're right
[2:13:49] when hell is on the earth
[2:13:54] god's called this man be a resurrection
[2:13:57] ministry to gentiles
[2:14:00] and this man
[2:14:01] he's in a self preservation
[2:14:07] he's he wants to preserve himself
[2:14:11] now he's in the second part of the
[2:14:13] resurrect of the
[2:14:15] rapture cycle
[2:14:17] where god's got to get preeminences over
[2:14:19] this man
[2:14:21] and all he sees is symptoms
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:28] remember god prepared a fish
[2:14:31] he says i'm going to get that man to be
[2:14:32] a resurrection ministry to nineveh those
[2:14:34] gentiles
[2:14:36] and this man is having a whole bunch of
[2:14:38] problems with his thinking
[2:14:41] and you know
[2:14:42] when you look at these types you've got
[2:14:43] to find out for yourself what is this
[2:14:46] fish that god prepared it was the god of
[2:14:49] nineveh
[2:14:50] amen
[2:14:52] is that right
[2:14:55] and here he is
[2:14:57] inside
[2:14:59] the god of nineveh
[2:15:01] and what is the god of this age hell has
[2:15:03] come up on the earth lay this here
[2:15:07] watch for verse 1 yes sir
[2:15:09] this man god's going to put him through
[2:15:12] something yes
[2:15:13] he said jonah you're looking at yourself
[2:15:16] all the time
[2:15:18] you're looking at your weaknesses your
[2:15:20] insecurities or yourself it's all about
[2:15:22] you but i've got to get preeminences
[2:15:24] over you in the second part of the
[2:15:25] rapture cycle
[2:15:27] amen
[2:15:29] and jonah prayed unto the lord his god
[2:15:32] out of the fish's belly watch what he
[2:15:34] says now and i cried by reason of mine
[2:15:36] affliction unto the lord and he heard me
[2:15:38] out of the belly of hell
[2:15:43] hell has come up on the earth is that
[2:15:45] right yes
[2:15:47] amen and here he is
[2:15:49] and the second part of the rap the
[2:15:51] rapture cycle hell has come up on the
[2:15:53] earth and has caught jonah in his
[2:15:55] self-will
[2:15:58] and all he looks at is symptoms
[2:16:03] and these symptoms
[2:16:06] is having an effect on them
[2:16:09] and god must remove those symptoms
[2:16:13] and he's got to shake this man
[2:16:15] this man is in the message he has read
[2:16:19] all about solomon
[2:16:21] he has read the book of ecclesiastes
[2:16:24] where solomon says it's all vanity
[2:16:28] and vanity is a vapor that passes away
[2:16:32] hey this world out here don't you think
[2:16:34] that's real
[2:16:36] it ain't real
[2:16:38] but i tell you something many people
[2:16:39] think it is real that's right
[2:16:41] it's passing away and brother branham
[2:16:44] says and souls that are in prison hell
[2:16:46] has come up on the earth
[2:16:49] amen is that right
[2:16:52] hell has come up on the earth and guess
[2:16:54] what we have to live amongst
[2:16:56] hell
[2:16:59] and it's affecting you and affecting
[2:17:01] jonah
[2:17:03] and this man
[2:17:05] he's down under this whale's gut
[2:17:09] and man it stinks down there brethren
[2:17:11] he'll tell you something it ain't a nun
[2:17:13] too flash down there
[2:17:16] it's just the worst stink that you can
[2:17:18] ever have down there
[2:17:20] and he's down there and god's training
[2:17:22] this man
[2:17:24] to stop looking at symptoms
[2:17:27] because as long as he's looking at those
[2:17:28] symptoms god can do nothing with him if
[2:17:31] he agrees with those symptoms
[2:17:33] he says i want you to be a resurrection
[2:17:34] ministry to them gentiles and he wants
[2:17:37] you to be a resurrection ministry to
[2:17:38] those gentiles brothers and sisters
[2:17:40] where is the mercy seat in the temple
[2:17:46] hello
[2:17:47] do you go out and preach jesus christ to
[2:17:49] people
[2:17:50] do you or do you not or do you sit at

[2:18:03] to work with about jesus christ and what
[2:18:05] he's doing in this day
[2:18:08] well you're seriously backslidden if
[2:18:09] you're not that's right
[2:18:12] because that's what you're here for
[2:18:15] amen

[2:18:18] you talk to the one that you work with
[2:18:20] about jesus christ and what he's doing

[2:18:22] he says give me the word convenient to
[2:18:25] me
[2:18:26] that was in our first opening scripture
[2:18:29] now look at this man
[2:18:33] he's going to shake this guy this this
[2:18:35] our brother down
[2:18:37] because in hebrews 12 he says i will not
[2:18:39] only shake the earth i'll shake the
[2:18:40] heavens and the earth i'm going to shake
[2:18:42] all your influence of this dna that
[2:18:45] you've been born with off of you
[2:18:48] until there's only
[2:18:51] one that remains the eternal things
[2:18:54] that's why god shakes us and shakes us
[2:18:56] and shakes us until oh the only thing
[2:18:59] left is eternal things in our thinking
[2:19:03] now watch him now
[2:19:05] i'm just doing this uh
[2:19:06] doing it on the hoof you know
[2:19:10] for you has cast me into the deep verse
[2:19:12] two three in the midst of the seas and
[2:19:15] the floods covers me about all the blows
[2:19:17] and the waves are passed over me i'm
[2:19:18] saving such a terrible time lord in this
[2:19:20] place that's called hell
[2:19:23] but you're an elected man boy
[2:19:27] hey
[2:19:28] i'm trying to get preeminences over you
[2:19:30] jonah and or as you see your symptoms
[2:19:34] come now amen and you're agreeing with
[2:19:37] them oh lord jesus

[2:19:45] situation
[2:19:47] that right oh i'm cast out of thy sight

[2:20:14] the waters that compass me about oh i'm
[2:20:16] having such a rotten time
[2:20:19] the depth closed around me
[2:20:21] the weeds are wrapped around my head
[2:20:22] yeah that's right that's where his
[2:20:23] problem was was his head
[2:20:29] now right
[2:20:30] so watch how you got to read between the
[2:20:32] lines
[2:20:34] because he said if you've got a
[2:20:36] revelation of those thunders you can see
[2:20:37] it from genesis to revelation and every
[2:20:40] type and shadow and the bible so i want
[2:20:43] to see the rapture cycle in the book of
[2:20:45] jonah amen

[2:20:56] life from corruption oh my lord

[2:21:08] he's been shaking me
[2:21:10] to get my mind off what's happening a
[2:21:12] bunch these serpent seeds out there on
[2:21:14] this earth and all their information

[2:21:26] i didn't see my name in grandma's book
[2:21:28] of dad's book or anything i saw my name
[2:21:30] in his book amen
[2:21:32] see he's awakening him to his true
[2:21:35] identity and the second part of the
[2:21:37] rapture cycle to be a resurrection
[2:21:39] ministry to the gentiles
[2:21:40] amen
[2:21:43] amen
[2:21:46] my prayer
[2:21:47] when i was my soul faded within me i
[2:21:49] remember the lord and my prayer came
[2:21:51] unto thee into thy holy temple

[2:21:57] his reality
[2:22:00] he's looking
[2:22:02] to the temple
[2:22:04] i'm not looking to my problems
[2:22:06] i'm looking to what god has made amen

[2:22:27] and this and this i've signed to the
[2:22:28] devil they can never come in you have
[2:22:30] forsaken your own mercy to your kids

[2:22:49] [Music]

[2:23:18] i am the mercy seat of god i do not care
[2:23:22] for the circumstances i'm looking at the
[2:23:24] promises
[2:23:25] and when i look at the promises of god
[2:23:27] even the hand will come back and be
[2:23:29] completely healed is that right yes
[2:23:33] we'll finish up on this
[2:23:34] hallelujah
[2:23:36] hallelujah
[2:23:39] did you know
[2:23:41] jesus said to your two ladies here i'll
[2:23:43] spew you out of my mouth
[2:23:47] but the whale said to jonah i've had
[2:23:49] enough of you boy
[2:23:51] the biggest chunder
[2:23:53] the world has ever seen
[2:24:01] he was down the only hood
[2:24:07] he was making
[2:24:09] the whale
[2:24:12] expel him
[2:24:14] i'm trying to be nice now you know
[2:24:19] ladasia cannot stand somebody who knows
[2:24:22] who they are
[2:24:24] that's right it will literally spew you
[2:24:27] out and i say praise god amen
[2:24:31] now brother talked
[2:24:34] about two little birds
[2:24:37] i'll finish on this
[2:24:40] i'll read it out to you somewhere away
[2:24:41] at the end i could be doing this for a
[2:24:43] long time because i said this is a five
[2:24:44] hour sermon we'll just go to the end
[2:24:47] my goodness me
[2:24:49] you should be thanking jesus that this
[2:24:51] is not lost
[2:24:54] my my my mind's about 150 slides
[2:24:56] my biggest one's 360.
[2:25:02] all right
[2:25:08] now it's quite an amazing thing
[2:25:11] now brother brahms speaks about two
[2:25:13] birds
[2:25:15] a robin and a nightingale
[2:25:19] two birds innocent little birds
[2:25:22] so that's why it's a story you watch
[2:25:24] every morning we get up grouchy
[2:25:27] and get out well i'm just about half
[2:25:30] asleep and so forth
[2:25:32] he says
[2:25:33] no wonder we've got high blood pressure
[2:25:35] diabetes and everything else
[2:25:37] you get out of bed grumpy
[2:25:40] is that right
[2:25:43] no brother that just doesn't happen
[2:25:45] oh my god
[2:25:47] he says look at that little robin
[2:25:51] to say
[2:25:52] is where he had to speak to me i tell
[2:25:53] you
[2:25:55] he will raise up other morning
[2:25:57] and the first thing throw his little
[2:25:59] head face upwards to the heavens and go
[2:26:01] singing at the top of his voice
[2:26:04] you never seen any sign of them with
[2:26:05] high blood pressure
[2:26:07] walking on crutches
[2:26:09] and diabetes
[2:26:15] and he says said a little robin said one
[2:26:18] time well or wonder what's the matter
[2:26:23] and creatures call themselves human
[2:26:25] beings
[2:26:28] said why they must be so sad maybe they
[2:26:30] haven't got a heavenly father like we've
[2:26:32] got that takes care of us
[2:26:38] see here's a prophet he's looking at
[2:26:40] nature
[2:26:41] and he sees a robin yeah and his robbers
[2:26:43] looking human beings look at they say
[2:26:46] they don't even know god like i know god
[2:26:48] i didn't have to worry and get diabetes
[2:26:50] and crutches god's looking after me but
[2:26:51] where were these funny creatures
[2:26:56] see where the sickness and that come
[2:26:57] from
[2:26:58] comes from attitude problems heart
[2:27:01] problems some attitude problems diabetes
[2:27:03] and grouchiness and
[2:27:05] that's where these things come from
[2:27:08] then he talks about another bird the
[2:27:09] nightingale
[2:27:11] one night holding a meeting in mill town
[2:27:13] baptist church when i was a little past
[2:27:15] at the pastor danny i was home with an
[2:27:17] old friend of mine to stay all night and
[2:27:18] i used to notice when i passed by
[2:27:20] there'd be a nightingale sitting on a
[2:27:22] cedar bush there all night long he would
[2:27:24] sing at the top of his voice remember
[2:27:26] this is at night now
[2:27:28] not even in the daytime in nightingale
[2:27:32] just as loud as he could sing how well i
[2:27:36] could understand why them birds sing
[2:27:38] when it's daylight
[2:27:39] i can imagine the sunlight bathing on
[2:27:41] them
[2:27:42] makes them sing but what makes the
[2:27:43] nightingale sing because he's not
[2:27:45] singing in the daytime he's singing at
[2:27:47] night
[2:27:51] and so i got me a book
[2:27:53] so brethren's reading up on this
[2:27:54] nightingale
[2:27:56] i come to find out that the knight and
[2:27:57] guy what what makes him sing
[2:28:00] that he watches the skies
[2:28:03] and every time that he can look to the
[2:28:05] sea the clouds begin to move back and
[2:28:07] see one star
[2:28:09] one ray of light he begins to scream
[2:28:12] hallelujah and sing to the top of his
[2:28:14] voice
[2:28:16] because he knows the suns are shining
[2:28:19] somewhere
[2:28:20] he's speaking to the earth that the suns
[2:28:23] are shining
[2:28:24] somewhere so this animal kingdom
[2:28:28] a prophet has to use nature to show us
[2:28:32] what his expectation is from you
[2:28:36] and what do we do we get up in the
[2:28:37] morning grouchy and gut-shaking about
[2:28:39] this and everything else like this and
[2:28:40] money problems and all this sort of
[2:28:42] things he says well actually you're not
[2:28:44] following what a prophet said
[2:28:46] because that's why you're sick and just
[2:28:48] have this problem and this problem and
[2:28:49] this problem
[2:28:51] and rome comes and flooding you out with
[2:28:53] psychology and you have to have this and
[2:28:54] have to have this or you'll catch this
[2:28:56] or you'll catch that it's garbage amen
[2:28:58] amen it's pure garbage
[2:29:05] how do you get what i feel like i ain't
[2:29:08] going to go and sign my name to anything
[2:29:10] that comes from the devil amen i might
[2:29:13] get tempted with this and tempted with
[2:29:15] that and when the temptation comes i
[2:29:16] throw it down then god can deal with the
[2:29:18] symptoms
[2:29:21] are you with me now
[2:29:22] let's stand to our feet
[2:29:31] i've kept it i've kept honest now it's
[2:29:33] not five hours
[2:29:35] could the musicians come forth please
[2:29:40] now i'll tell you something i took a
[2:29:41] meeting in russia that was 12 hours long
[2:29:44] so don't complain

[2:29:58] twelve long hours and you couldn't get
[2:30:00] them out of the church

[2:30:07] man
[2:30:08] honestly
[2:30:11] you just couldn't get them out now
[2:30:14] it went from midday to after midnight to
[2:30:17] end the following day amen they want to
[2:30:20] go home
[2:30:22] this is the kind of
[2:30:23] god
[2:30:26] may that be our portion
