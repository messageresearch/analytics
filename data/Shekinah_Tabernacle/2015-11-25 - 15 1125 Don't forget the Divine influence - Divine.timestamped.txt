[4:19] about how
[4:20] how that if if
[4:22] people would let the Holy Ghost in about
[4:25] how much of a difference it would make
[4:26] to everything he said it would you

[4:30] you wouldn't need every prostitute house
[4:32] will be closed
[4:34] um you know that there would be no
[4:36] trouble if people just let the Holy
[4:37] Ghost in and one of his sayings was he

[22:58] none of those things Lord yet you loved

[24:29] amen
[24:37] um
[24:38] if you'd like to turn with me to Second
[24:39] Timothy
[24:41] good to have sister Marty with us here
[24:43] God bless you
[24:44] good to have you with us
[24:46] um just like to take a bit of a thought
[24:48] I was reading
[24:50] I was reading some scriptures last night
[24:52] and I was looking into
[24:54] lots and words mean and a particular
[24:59] I just want to go into one word here
[25:02] so second Timothy and we'll just read
[25:04] verses uh chapter so in chapter one
[25:06] we're even verse one down to verse six
[25:10] and it says here now well I'm in person
[25:12] I think he's not gonna help me second
[25:14] Timothy Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[25:17] by the will of God according to the
[25:19] promise of life
[25:21] which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my
[25:24] dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace
[25:28] from God the father and Christ Jesus our
[25:30] lord I thank God whom I serve from my
[25:34] forefathers with pure conscience that
[25:36] without ceasing I have remembrance of
[25:38] thee in my prayers night and day greatly
[25:40] Desiring to see thee being mindful of
[25:42] thy tears that I may be filled with joy
[25:46] when I call to remembrance the unframed
[25:48] faith that is in thee which dwelt first
[25:51] in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother
[25:54] Eunice and I am persuaded that in the uh
[25:57] I and I'm and sorry I am persuaded that
[26:00] in thee also therefore I put thee in
[26:03] remembrance that thou stir up the gift
[26:05] of God which is in thee by the putting
[26:08] on of my hands for God has not given us
[26:11] a spirit of fear but of power and of
[26:14] love and of a sound mind amen May Lord
[26:17] bless his word you may be seated
[26:19] so I want to I just want to go into uh
[26:22] maybe try and continue in some way from
[26:25] from from Sunday speaking about how if
[26:27] we're not divinely led by God and stay
[26:30] surrendered to God everything in life
[26:32] will push us off the road but if we
[26:34] yielded to him as we walk with him it
[26:36] doesn't matter if something bad happens
[26:37] at work or at school or in family or in
[26:40] church or whatever it is because we're
[26:42] surrendered to the Lord he'll keep us in
[26:44] the middle of the way
[26:45] and Timothy here is a classic example of
[26:48] of a believer that Paul is we know that
[26:51] Timothy was he was called to do the work
[26:54] of an evangelist he was in the ministry
[26:56] in that day and you could say he was
[26:58] Paul's Protege you know who who went
[27:00] round with Paul and any and he observed
[27:03] you know the manner of life that the
[27:05] great Apostle Paul had and he and he and
[27:08] he he he was a believer in his day and
[27:10] he saw an example of Christianity and
[27:12] Paul he could say he saw a mature part
[27:14] of the field in Paul he he saw a mature
[27:17] Christian at work and we understand that
[27:20] when Paul is writing letters he's
[27:22] addressing things that they have written
[27:24] to him so he's actually answering
[27:26] questions that or or or things that he's
[27:28] heard he's actually directly addressing
[27:30] things but we understand that these
[27:32] letters not only speak to them like to
[27:34] Timothy but it speaks to every believer
[27:36] down Through the Ages and so Timothy has
[27:39] come to a point in his life where
[27:41] something has happened to him and that's
[27:43] actually caused him to deviate not into
[27:46] sin but something's actually affected
[27:48] his life and it's actually impacted in a
[27:50] bad way upon his walk with God and so
[27:53] Paul is addressing Timothy in a certain
[27:55] way to try and stir him up that
[27:59] whatever's happened in his life will not
[28:01] hold him back but he about to break
[28:03] forever and walk with the Lord as he
[28:05] first did and so this is really the
[28:08] direction I want to go and so Paul it's
[28:10] amazing here where you know just in
[28:12] verse two he says to Timothy my dearly
[28:14] beloved Son grace mercy and peace from
[28:18] God the father and Christ Jesus our lord
[28:21] now this word Grace here this word Grace
[28:25] you know because I you know you read
[28:27] words you say well we know I understand
[28:29] Grace means unmerited favor
[28:31] but it also it also uh this word here
[28:36] so this is just from the Greek it means
[28:38] graciousness as gratifying a manner or
[28:42] act
[28:43] uh figurative or spiritual especially
[28:47] the Divine influence upon the heart
[28:51] and Its Reflection In The Life there's
[28:54] what this Grace this word Grace means so
[28:57] it means a Divine especially a Divine
[29:00] influence upon the heart
[29:02] and Its Reflection In The Life so Paul
[29:06] is telling Timothy here by saying grace
[29:09] be unto you he's he's actually stirring
[29:12] up to me saying
[29:14] think upon the Divine influence that God
[29:18] has put upon your life
[29:20] amen put upon the heart put up the
[29:24] Divine influence that he's put upon your
[29:26] heart this is what he's telling Timothy
[29:28] because we can see as we keep reading
[29:30] God he says therefore I put thee in
[29:32] remembrance that thou stir up the gift
[29:34] of God and every gift you know every
[29:37] believer has a gift and that first gift
[29:39] is Faith and that Faith works out
[29:41] according to the office that ain't that
[29:43] a Believer is in his it's either
[29:45] Ministry or helps or governments or you
[29:47] know prayer or you know Paul outlines
[29:49] all the ministry gifts you know all the
[29:51] gifts that are in the body and so he's
[29:53] saying stir up the gift of God because
[29:55] Something's Happened that's caused them
[29:57] to to to withdraw himself in a certain
[30:00] way so he's actually saying this is how
[30:02] you overcome this is to stir up the
[30:04] faith stir up what God has done for you
[30:07] because there's power and testimony and
[30:10] so he's saying think of this Divine
[30:12] influence that that has come upon your
[30:14] heart because Timothy he was raised in a
[30:16] Christian home but there came a point
[30:19] where the god that has grandmother knew
[30:21] and the god that his mother knew became
[30:23] his God so he didn't just hear the
[30:26] stories of what God did for grandma or
[30:28] mump but that God became real to him
[30:31] because Paul says the faith that was in
[30:33] their grandmother lost and my mother
[30:35] Eunice I'm persuaded as indeed so he
[30:37] could see
[30:38] Timothy knew God for himself and we
[30:42] understand that as the most vital thing
[30:44] in all this life is that you know him
[30:46] and the power of his resurrection
[30:48] that's it's not enough just to know
[30:50] about him but you must know him to know
[30:53] him as life we understand the scripture
[30:54] tells us and so there there came a
[30:57] Divine influence upon Timothy's life and
[31:01] that influenced you know you know no
[31:03] doubt if if you know we went back into
[31:05] his life when he was being raised by his
[31:07] mum and dad and these things and we went
[31:10] to him and said Timothy there's a Divine
[31:12] influence upon your life and he'd say
[31:14] what do you mean
[31:15] there's mommy and daddy there's my
[31:17] grandmother's Believers around me all
[31:19] right yo we have church however they had
[31:21] Church in those days they read the you
[31:24] know you read the Bible we pray together
[31:26] and he say this is just everyday life
[31:28] but man
[31:30] so often looks at the wrong kind of
[31:32] thing because in God's eyes that was a
[31:34] Divine influence had come upon Timothy's
[31:36] life and he no doubt is you know as as
[31:40] he was growing up he began to recognize
[31:42] God speaking to me God's calling me
[31:46] God's dealing with my heart you know
[31:48] when conviction Came Upon My Heart or I
[31:50] did something wrong lord said put that
[31:51] right that was divine influence coming
[31:54] down upon Timothy
[31:56] now the heart the heart is the seat
[32:00] you know is the source of thoughts or
[32:03] feelings it's also your mind it's a seed
[32:06] of your affection there's many things
[32:07] that the heart is you know Jesus would
[32:10] say out of the abundance of the you know
[32:12] out of the abundance of the heart does
[32:14] man speak so everything that really
[32:16] comes out of someone's mouth is a
[32:18] reflection of what is in them
[32:21] and so Timothy you know you notice
[32:24] notice he says that this this Divine
[32:27] influence upon you know you know this
[32:30] Divine influence is upon his heart it's
[32:32] not upon his mental thinking or his
[32:34] feelings but it's upon the very core
[32:37] being of himself this Divine influence
[32:39] has come down upon him
[32:41] and so this is this is this is really
[32:44] important because we must understand
[32:46] that you know God doesn't haphazardly
[32:48] just call someone he doesn't just
[32:50] haphazardly say maybe I'll pick this
[32:52] person from this place and then I'll
[32:54] call them but God has a purpose of
[32:56] calling people and it's not just to use
[32:58] them to further his work but God has
[33:01] always been looking for parts of himself
[33:03] down Through the Ages when Adam and Eve
[33:06] fell part of Godfather and so God had to
[33:10] redeem them because they were part of
[33:11] himself
[33:12] amen so down Through the Ages God has
[33:15] been looking for parts of himself
[33:17] amen and so that's why that's why a
[33:20] Divine influence comes upon us is
[33:22] because God begins to brood over us to
[33:25] really draw out the real us and you see
[33:28] Genesis chapter one you know you see the
[33:30] creation that is not only God revealing
[33:33] his creation but speaks of what God does
[33:36] to the human soul
[33:37] because it says in the beginning God
[33:40] made heavens and earth there's a period
[33:42] there's a full stop and multitudes of
[33:44] schools of thought stumble over the full
[33:46] stop when it comes to age and then it
[33:48] says the darkness covered the face of
[33:50] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[33:52] upon the face of the waters
[33:54] and if you continue to read the chapter
[33:56] the seeds are already in the Earth but
[33:59] they're covered up with Darkness they
[34:00] covered up with water you know and then
[34:02] but the spirit of God begins to brood
[34:04] over the face of the deep
[34:06] amen and man we understand in the Book
[34:09] of Revelation is spoken of as multitudes
[34:12] Nations and tugs is is water
[34:15] amen and so now God the speaks of God's
[34:18] Great Redemption plan as he's been
[34:20] brooding over the Earth
[34:22] I mean from from the beginning even to
[34:25] now he's been brooding in every age
[34:27] doesn't matter if it was in Moses's time
[34:29] or Jeremiah's time or Elijah's time or
[34:32] Jesus or the apostles or Martin Luther
[34:34] God has been brooding over the Earth
[34:37] because God knows his seat down in the
[34:39] earth in this great multitude of people
[34:41] there's like a a tenth or a type of
[34:44] humanity he's going to take for himself
[34:46] and so he's been brooding over the Earth
[34:48] to find you
[34:49] amen and so now Divine influences upon
[34:53] this Earth we can see that just by
[34:55] looking in the word and looking at what
[34:57] we see around us is that there's a
[34:59] Divine influence and it's calling the
[35:02] hearts of men and women and children to
[35:04] come to where they came from to come to
[35:07] their makers so we see that as God would
[35:10] God would brood over the Earth in
[35:11] Genesis there you know he separates the
[35:13] light and darkness he you know he causes
[35:15] the land to come up separates the waters
[35:17] and then then finally the seed comes
[35:20] forth it's already in the Earth
[35:22] because when it says let there be light
[35:24] that word Let There Be actually means
[35:25] for it to appear
[35:27] amen
[35:28] and so God God brewed it over the Earth
[35:32] to bring out the life that is in it
[35:34] you see and God had a purpose he didn't
[35:37] just come to this earth and say well
[35:39] this is a nice planet now I'll just I'll
[35:41] just I'll just brood over and see what's
[35:43] in it he knew what was under all that
[35:45] darkness and when he came and began to
[35:47] brood over you he knew what was
[35:49] underneath the darkness
[35:51] amen he knew what was buried it might
[35:53] have been buried deep in in in in
[35:56] cultural or religion or you know
[35:59] whatever it was something was buried
[36:01] deep but he knew it was there
[36:02] amen and so he was brooding to find that
[36:05] which you know which was in there and
[36:07] then begin to draw it out
[36:09] and God because God is a gentleman
[36:13] he allows he has to actually let you
[36:16] know he actually waits for you to
[36:17] respond
[36:19] hey Broods but then the one he's
[36:22] brooding over has to react back to the
[36:24] one that's drawing him
[36:26] amen he the other person because
[36:28] remember out of the heart you know the
[36:30] heart you have to open your open your
[36:32] life Surrender Your Life to him see I've
[36:34] got to be willing he comes to you he
[36:36] Broods you feel his presence but then
[36:38] you have to respond the believer has to
[36:41] respond and so Timothy came to a place
[36:44] in his life where he responded and God
[36:47] began to use Timothy in a mighty way
[36:49] now
[36:51] Timothy
[36:53] this word here for God has not given us
[36:55] the spirit of fear this word fear
[36:58] actually speaks of being timid
[37:01] that is faithless or fearful but the
[37:04] main meaning of it is actually being
[37:06] timid
[37:08] and so he's saying because memories
[37:10] meant to do the work under evangelist so
[37:12] whatever you're called to do in life
[37:14] Satan will actually come your way to
[37:16] stop you doing what you meant to be
[37:18] called to do so how do you stop an
[37:20] evangelist how do you stop an evangelist
[37:22] make him lose his confidence
[37:24] hey man cause them to withdrawal make
[37:27] him feel timid
[37:29] because remember evangelist is a bold
[37:31] you know they're built as a bold and a
[37:33] bold anointing comes and you know they
[37:34] preach with you know they're not they're
[37:37] not scholarly people they're built a
[37:39] different way
[37:40] so Timothy was actually the devil did
[37:43] something to him to try and hinder what
[37:45] he was called to do in that age
[37:47] I mean because he's called to do the
[37:48] work of an evangelist he wasn't an
[37:50] evangelist called to do the work of an
[37:52] evangelist you see so and you can see
[37:55] that you can see it you know Godly
[37:58] sisters who are who are mothers and you
[38:00] know who are who are wives what happens
[38:03] your call to that office what happens
[38:05] the Devil comes along your way and tries
[38:07] to you know it comes against that and
[38:10] cause you to withdraw
[38:12] from what you're called to be you see
[38:15] that in every facet of Life the devil
[38:17] deals with us differently because he
[38:19] sees he sees the potential in you what
[38:22] you're trying to achieve and what you
[38:23] feel you know as soon as you begin to
[38:25] because he doesn't know what you're
[38:27] thinking the devil can't read your
[38:28] thoughts so as soon as you begin to
[38:30] confess and speak thinks he's there and
[38:34] he's listening because he knows who you
[38:36] are
[38:37] we know Thou Art come you know Jesus you
[38:40] know Thou Art the Holy One of Israel
[38:41] have you come to tormentors before the
[38:43] time they knew who he was
[38:46] hello Mrs Jesus Christ who's the
[38:48] feminine attribute of him
[38:50] amen if if the devil knew who he was he
[38:55] certainly knows what you are
[38:57] he's without a doubt he knows who you
[38:59] are
[39:00] and so he will he will cause he will try
[39:03] and derail you like he tried to derail
[39:05] Timothy
[39:07] to come exactly against what you're
[39:09] called to be in this day and hour and it
[39:12] doesn't matter it like you can take it
[39:14] into business you'll try and ruin your
[39:16] confidence in you know in in the Lord's
[39:19] leadership and business or as a father
[39:21] or as a mother he'll try and get you to
[39:23] be discouraged
[39:25] I mean
[39:27] but God has not given us the spirit of
[39:30] fear or to be timid
[39:33] Amen to lose confidence in what you are
[39:36] remember a few if you have family you're
[39:39] you're being ordained to be a a husband
[39:42] or a wife
[39:43] amen or a father or a mother God is God
[39:46] has placed you in a position
[39:48] God has confidence the reason he gave
[39:50] you his seed to raise remember children
[39:53] are not ours they just are lit to us for
[39:56] a season but he he because he wanted to
[39:58] have he wanted to reflect himself the
[40:01] little ones in this age so God chose you
[40:03] to do it
[40:05] amen God wants Godly grandmas and godly
[40:09] husbands and wives and mothers and
[40:10] fathers and so he actually ordained you
[40:12] like he spoke to Moses he ordained Moses
[40:15] to do a work or Peter James or John or
[40:18] Paul or brother Branham they are
[40:19] ordained to do her work
[40:21] and your work is just as important as
[40:24] their work
[40:25] Amen brother Bramble is a dispensational
[40:27] prophet he has a prophet to the age and
[40:30] he was called to that and he lived out
[40:31] his calling but we are called under that
[40:34] same word you know the prophet tells us
[40:36] that the bride under her Messenger will
[40:38] be the final voice to the final age he
[40:40] says in the church age book and so he
[40:43] says these things that we can understand
[40:44] we are called to a certain work
[40:47] how do you be a voice and look you know
[40:50] a voice is not preaching on the street
[40:52] corner but to be a voice is to live the
[40:55] word or Jesus comes and lives in you and
[40:59] that and you become a voice now
[41:01] you become you actually become a
[41:03] preacher every day
[41:05] you may never say a word but your life
[41:07] preaches to this world
[41:09] so you've been ordained to preach this
[41:11] gospel to every creature
[41:13] amen this is what you've been called to
[41:16] do but the devil will try and push you
[41:18] off the road
[41:20] and you'll lose confidence see he tries
[41:22] to you know sometimes the devil will
[41:25] plug away at you as hard as he can that
[41:27] doesn't mean you're not in the will of
[41:28] God
[41:29] amen
[41:31] don't be discouraged and whatever you're
[41:34] doing
[41:35] if it's raising children going to work
[41:37] whatever you're called to do don't be
[41:39] discouraged be rugged
[41:41] I mean thank God in his word you say
[41:43] every every bomb of Hell's Falling on My
[41:46] Head say praise the Lord
[41:48] amen amen don't be God has not given us
[41:51] the spirit of fear
[41:54] Timothy lost his you know you know he
[41:57] lost he lost his confidence he withdrew
[42:02] amen and so Paul was rallying him say
[42:05] you know stir up the gift of faith that
[42:07] you have
[42:09] amen that this Divine think of remember
[42:11] the Divine influence has come upon your
[42:13] life
[42:14] amen come upon your heart there's a
[42:16] Divine influence has come and the reason
[42:18] it has come is because your part you're
[42:21] part of him remember God came to seek
[42:23] and save that which was lost
[42:25] so he came to find bits of himself that
[42:29] were lost
[42:30] amen and then I trust you can say
[42:32] tonight I have been found
[42:34] what does that mean I was lost and now
[42:36] I'm found I was blind but now I see
[42:39] where were you lost from you came out of
[42:42] the thoughts of God you expressed in
[42:44] time
[42:45] amen and because you were born in this
[42:48] Fallen fallen way you were lost and
[42:51] undone and you needed redeeming
[42:53] because brother Brown tells us you know
[42:55] we are
[42:56] we are Eternal beings the believer is an
[43:00] eternal being
[43:01] living out in time
[43:03] we're not time beings we're not time
[43:05] beings exp you know experiencing A Bit
[43:07] of Heaven but we're Heavenly beings
[43:10] experiencing a bit of time
[43:12] because brother Brandon brings it very
[43:13] simply he says to have eternal life it
[43:16] doesn't mean you get it one day and now
[43:18] you have eternal life you always had
[43:19] eternal life that you just had to
[43:22] recognize who your daddy was
[43:25] amen and then and then when that happens
[43:27] and you recognize that he paid the price
[43:30] for you then Faith Comes amen then you
[43:33] begin to recognize what you are
[43:35] when the church when the bride
[43:37] recognizes what she is then the Rapture
[43:41] will come well then the Rapture will go
[43:43] when she recognizes that it wasn't
[43:46] Hazard that that you heard the voice of
[43:48] God in your day it wasn't a haphazard
[43:50] thing that you gave yourself to him it
[43:53] wasn't it's not a haphazard thing it's
[43:55] premeditated by God he knew the season
[43:57] he knew the hour that you would be here
[44:00] you know brother Brown tells us and who
[44:03] is this Melchizedek he says Melchizedek
[44:05] was God in another in a theophany form
[44:07] where he came and spoke to Abraham
[44:09] amen and then so what happened is as God
[44:13] went from invisible God to theophany and
[44:16] then he went to and he became flesh in
[44:18] Jesus Christ the same God all the way
[44:20] down from before Genesis 1 1 he came
[44:23] down into flesh
[44:25] can't the gods ain't God condescending
[44:27] down through the Bible
[44:29] and he said but the prophet said that is
[44:31] why Jesus in some places said he knew
[44:34] all things is because he went from you
[44:36] know from theophany to flesh
[44:38] but brother man tells us that we didn't
[44:40] go theophany we do we bypassed our
[44:43] theophany and came to flesh
[44:45] amen
[44:46] so he's telling us now that we're
[44:49] Eternal as God is eternal
[44:52] because if this Earthly Tabernacle this
[44:55] thing be dissolved we have one waiting
[44:58] Eternal in the heavens an eternal body
[45:01] so it doesn't mean it's being built it's
[45:04] already built it's already there waiting
[45:06] for us
[45:08] amen and so the very reason that God we
[45:13] hear the voice you know when I heard
[45:15] brother Brandon for the first time it
[45:16] spoke to me like nothing else has ever
[45:18] spoken to me in my entire life
[45:20] I mean it took me a while to surrender
[45:22] but I gave myself to it when I came to
[45:25] realize
[45:26] my friends
[45:27] you know
[45:29] I was scared my friends would leave me
[45:31] but just having their they were they're
[45:33] good people but just having them as
[45:35] friends didn't give me peace
[45:38] hey man it didn't give me said it didn't
[45:39] give me lasting satisfaction
[45:41] but then when I fully surrendered to the
[45:44] Lord and then he came and then I had the
[45:45] peace then I had the satisfaction
[45:48] and so
[45:50] what happens is because we have that
[45:53] Eternal we have a body waiting in the
[45:55] heavens every believer has one
[45:58] and because we have that when we hear
[46:01] the voice of God speaking
[46:03] it speaks to us like nothing else does
[46:07] amen because that's an eternal voice
[46:10] that doesn't come out of a map you know
[46:12] it didn't come out of Kentucky didn't
[46:14] come out of Jeffersonville that voice
[46:16] came out of heaven amen because Moses
[46:19] when Moses was speaking it wasn't Moses
[46:21] speaking when he said thus saith the
[46:23] Lord it wasn't thus saith Moses speaking
[46:25] that was God using a man to speak to his
[46:27] people and the people who recognize this
[46:30] is more than Moses sure we walk with him
[46:32] in the desert sure we've seen where he
[46:34] was raised and you know in Pharaoh's
[46:35] house and we've seen all the different
[46:36] things but this is more than this man
[46:38] speaking and when they recognize this
[46:41] was God speaking to us and they said the
[46:43] promise Belongs To Us the land belongs
[46:45] to us the the resurrection belongs to us
[46:48] and they receive what they wanted or
[46:51] what they needed because they believed
[46:53] it was for them
[46:55] you understand so it wasn't Moses
[46:57] speaking it was thus saith the Lord it
[46:59] was God speaking
[47:01] and the reason the reason that something
[47:03] in this response to that voice is
[47:06] because we have a body waiting in the
[47:08] heavens
[47:09] amen that is the reason
[47:12] it's not because we're good people or
[47:15] we're religious people or what that's
[47:17] that's irrelevant but the very reason
[47:19] there's something in here that responds
[47:21] is because there's a body
[47:23] calling for me to enter into that body
[47:26] there's a deep calling to the deep and
[47:29] the prophet tells us very simply if
[47:31] there's a deep there has to be deep
[47:33] there up in heaven in order for there to
[47:36] be a deep here and if there's a longing
[47:38] if you have a long in your heart I want
[47:40] more of Jesus that means there's more of
[47:42] Jesus to have that means there is a
[47:44] Jesus to have
[47:45] amen and the very reason matters is
[47:48] because there's a body waiting for me
[47:50] amen does not have as this this walk is
[47:54] not a haphazard walk it's not a you know
[47:57] we're Eternal beings just in time
[48:00] I mean just for us to mold out character
[48:04] Hallelujah
[48:06] you know that's why that's why the
[48:07] prophet he you know he went he went
[48:09] before there was a molecule and then he
[48:11] went all the way back to the heaven you
[48:13] know new heavens and new earth as whole
[48:15] Ministry expanded that big span is
[48:17] because he was showing now this is where
[48:19] you come from the very mind of God and
[48:22] then this is where you're going to end
[48:23] up in new heavens and new earth where
[48:26] sin and everything is just done away
[48:27] with us not even a memory
[48:29] amen so we're Eternal beings I trust you
[48:33] know just just think about this world a
[48:36] bit different
[48:38] you know it's not well I'm from here and
[48:40] I have this problem and this is going
[48:41] wrong all those it's all good
[48:44] amen when you come to the end of
[48:47] yourself just let them take you the rest
[48:49] of the way
[48:50] amen that's all you need to do
[48:53] Hallelujah that's all you need to do
[48:54] Hannah had a burning desire to have a
[48:57] son
[48:58] amen at a great Junction in in Israel's
[49:02] history she had a burden I must have a
[49:05] child
[49:06] she had a burden oh hello and the and
[49:08] and even the priesthood couldn't discern
[49:10] her need
[49:12] gotta read the story but she had a great
[49:14] need but the reason she had that need is
[49:17] because God needed a prophet upon the
[49:19] Earth to anoint a king
[49:21] amen so so God was working God was
[49:23] working both ends
[49:25] amen so if you have a desire to serve
[49:28] the Lord that's because God is working
[49:30] the other end
[49:31] amen and so God tells I mean yeah God
[49:35] tells Timothy but to say God told
[49:37] Timothy
[49:39] to stir up the gift that's within thee
[49:42] God told it wasn't Paul saying these
[49:45] things God told them that
[49:46] amen
[49:49] so Timothy he was trying to be and it's
[49:51] amazing because he says be not thou
[49:53] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[49:55] Our Lord nor of me his prisoner
[49:58] but the but be thou partakers of the
[50:01] Affliction of The Gospel According to
[50:04] the power of God so he's actually saying
[50:06] don't be uh he's saying here don't be
[50:09] ashamed not only of the Lord but don't
[50:11] be ashamed of the messenger
[50:14] I mean don't be ashamed of the messenger
[50:18] Hallelujah
[50:19] so now Timothy
[50:23] you know
[50:25] now this this unfrained faith
[50:29] it means it means a sincere faith
[50:32] without hypocrisy he was genuine he had
[50:35] a genuine faith
[50:37] and Paul I'm just maybe I just repeat
[50:40] myself for a little bit but I trusted
[50:42] sinks in you I trust you can put
[50:44] yourself in Timothy's shoes
[50:46] the devil's tried to deep probably
[50:48] derail you even today
[50:51] amen something goes wrong and you begin
[50:53] to condemn yourself you're not good
[50:55] you're not a good dad you're not a good
[50:58] husband you failed again you're no good
[51:00] at your job
[51:02] amen and the devil uses the devil tries
[51:06] to derail you
[51:08] that you would actually the spirit he
[51:11] has not given us a spirit of fear of
[51:13] being timid about it
[51:15] we're called in this day to possess what
[51:18] God has given us
[51:21] amen and it doesn't and and and that can
[51:23] be to be a housewife to be a real
[51:25] housewife to be a real husband to be a
[51:28] real wife to be a real brother or father
[51:30] or mother or whatever whatever we're
[51:32] called to be God has called us to you
[51:35] know to possess fully what what that is
[51:37] to be
[51:38] so what does that mean so if you're a
[51:40] parent that means you don't shine your
[51:42] responsibility of being a parent
[51:44] amen or or if you're in business or
[51:46] working doesn't mean you shun your you
[51:48] know shun your responsibility because
[51:51] Ahab shunned his responsibility and
[51:53] Jezebel took the throne
[51:55] amen because he didn't fully you know
[51:57] possess the office and he was called to
[51:59] call to be in so we're not called to do
[52:02] that friends
[52:03] remember God remember this this Divine
[52:05] expect the Divine influence upon the
[52:08] heart
[52:09] and Its Reflection In The Life so Grace
[52:12] enables you to live the word
[52:16] that's what Grace does
[52:18] it enables you to live the word
[52:21] so Timothy was being reminded
[52:25] he was being reminded of these things
[52:28] and this is important because here is
[52:31] the first church age messenger telling
[52:33] the Next Generation he's instructing a
[52:36] few a younger generation because soon
[52:38] after this Paul's head's going to be
[52:40] taken off he's going to go on to glory
[52:42] and that voice is going to be silenced
[52:44] and now it's the next generation's
[52:46] burden now to pick up the mantle
[52:49] amen and to keep declaring the word
[52:53] and we we're 50 years down the road
[52:56] amen I've never been to Jeffersonville
[52:59] you know I've never you know but but it
[53:01] falls out a lot
[53:03] and then I'm not just talking about
[53:06] gathering in this building and having
[53:08] church I mean I mean in family life it's
[53:11] fallen out a lot to live this word
[53:14] amen and you know even in the smallest
[53:17] thing it's Fallen our lot
[53:20] I mean the burden has been placed upon
[53:22] our shoulders
[53:24] it's a Timothy
[53:27] he's you know
[53:29] verse 9 who has saved us and called us
[53:32] with a holy calling not according to our
[53:34] works but according to his own purpose
[53:37] and Grace which he has given us in
[53:39] Christ Jesus before the world began
[53:44] but has now made manifest by the
[53:46] appearing of Our Savior Jesus Jesus
[53:48] Christ who hath abolished death and hath
[53:51] brought life and immortality to light
[53:54] unto the gospel where unto I'm appointed
[53:57] a preacher an apostle and a teacher of
[54:00] the Gentiles so Paul is telling Saint
[54:03] Paul if we can just get our mind off
[54:05] Earthly things
[54:07] sure we're called to have family you
[54:09] know do all the natural things I'm not
[54:11] saying forget about those things
[54:13] but we need to look beyond what we see
[54:16] and conditions of life and how things
[54:19] affect us naturally because it's a
[54:21] Timothy he needed to recognize what had
[54:24] come against him wasn't a flesh and
[54:25] blood Affair but the devil was fighting
[54:28] against him to try and to try and uh you
[54:31] know you know immobilize him that he
[54:33] couldn't do the work he was called to do
[54:35] and so that's why now Paul is saying now
[54:38] that this you know this holy calling was
[54:42] not according to our works
[54:44] but according to his own purpose and
[54:46] Grace which he has given us in Christ
[54:49] Jesus before the world began so so he's
[54:53] saying to God is telling Timothy
[54:55] this calling and this purpose
[54:58] that you've been called to do was
[55:00] ordained before the foundation of the
[55:02] world Amen it's already been you were
[55:05] you weren't called haphazardly he's
[55:08] trying to tell him we weren't called
[55:09] haphazardly
[55:11] amen you say this may be very very
[55:14] Elementary it's not Elementary if we can
[55:17] if we can recognize that we're part of
[55:19] God himself
[55:20] that God has called us because he's
[55:22] looking for parts of himself and our
[55:25] walk in this Earth has been pre-arranged
[55:28] by God
[55:29] our footsteps have been pre-arranged
[55:32] and everything that comes into our life
[55:34] is because God is ordained it
[55:37] amen
[55:39] and the devil wants to discourage you
[55:41] because of what you view as your
[55:43] failings
[55:45] amen that's why he says it's not by
[55:47] works this holy calling is not according
[55:49] to our works
[55:50] because the other devil loves to
[55:52] snowball things
[55:54] you get discouraged and then he pours
[55:57] upon that discouragement
[55:58] and then you withdraw a little bit more
[56:00] and you say there's no way I can do
[56:03] these things and and he just pours it on
[56:05] you
[56:07] am I the only one who does that too
[56:11] you see so he tries to he tries to
[56:14] discourage you but you know stir up the
[56:17] gift of faith
[56:18] I mean stir up stir up what's in your
[56:21] heart don't look at don't let these
[56:23] things you down but stir up the
[56:25] gift because brother man tells us that
[56:28] the true you know laying on of hands is
[56:30] not to impart gifts it's a recognition
[56:32] of the gift that's already there because
[56:34] gifts and callings are without
[56:35] repentance
[56:36] hey man so so he's encouraging him to
[56:40] stir up the gift that's within him
[56:43] amen
[56:44] not to let the devil get him down
[56:48] now we're called
[56:52] we are called in the same way
[56:55] that God would use us for a work
[56:59] now sometimes we get in our mind and and
[57:01] I and I've already mentioned this
[57:03] earlier but sometimes we get in our mind
[57:05] it must be of the law because
[57:06] everything's going fine
[57:08] sometimes that's true
[57:10] sometimes the devil fights against
[57:12] everything he can do
[57:14] amen but you've got to know what you're
[57:17] called to do
[57:18] and if it's settled in your heart I you
[57:21] know I've been ordained to do a certain
[57:23] thing all the guns of hell can be
[57:25] shooting fully automatic on you and it
[57:27] won't won't cause you to bother a bit
[57:30] amen you've got to know what you're
[57:32] called to do and then stay true to that
[57:34] vision
[57:36] stay true you know it doesn't matter if
[57:37] it's family doesn't matter if it's job
[57:40] or church or whatever it is stay true to
[57:43] the vision
[57:44] whatever you do stay true to what God
[57:47] has called you to do remember God's
[57:49] called us to take a Rapture I'm just
[57:50] gonna I'm just going to bring it down
[57:51] God's called us to take a rapture
[57:54] I mean stay true to the vision that God
[57:58] has sent a word in this end time to
[58:00] prepare us for the rapture
[58:02] amen God has called us to be lifted up
[58:05] to be joint heirs with him and that's
[58:07] what his Redemption has caused in US
[58:11] and if he has done that remember
[58:14] this holy calling
[58:17] but according see it's according to his
[58:19] own purpose
[58:21] so don't you know sometimes people get
[58:24] intimidated all the bride how can I ever
[58:26] become the bride
[58:28] brother bam says the bridegroom call
[58:31] will come right through this speaking of
[58:33] his own message and I was listening to
[58:35] Invisible Union and then in the
[58:36] beginning of that sermon he says
[58:38] there'll come a message which will sweep
[58:40] out and it'll catch the bride and then
[58:42] not so there's not verbatim but but down
[58:44] through that ceremony says he says the
[58:46] messages gone out to catch the bride
[58:49] amen
[58:50] so the very reason that we have
[58:53] responded
[58:55] to the word
[58:57] is because we are what God is looking
[58:59] for
[59:00] amen
[59:02] God is looking for a part of he's
[59:04] looking for the feminine part of himself
[59:06] he's looking for himself you know you
[59:10] know he's looking for himself and Bride
[59:12] for
[59:13] amen this is what he's he's not looking
[59:15] for servants he's not looking for Palace
[59:17] guards or just some Lackey some some
[59:20] some you know kitchen hand or something
[59:22] but he's looking for royalty
[59:25] and
[59:27] and so that you know if that's what he's
[59:28] looking for he'll send his word to find
[59:31] what he's looking for
[59:32] and so he and so so something's in you
[59:36] has responded to the word it's because
[59:39] you are that Royal lady that is looking
[59:41] for
[59:43] amen
[59:46] that's it now
[59:49] he he sends his word to accomplish
[59:51] certain things
[59:54] and he sent this word now so so we get
[59:57] you know we get so we get so sometimes
[1:00:00] intimidate oh how could I ever be the
[1:00:01] bride of Christ and brother Brown tells
[1:00:03] us that before the foundation of the
[1:00:05] world he put the wedding band of
[1:00:07] unmerited predestinated Grace upon your
[1:00:09] finger
[1:00:10] amen this is what he tells us so because
[1:00:13] you responded like the apostles they
[1:00:16] responded to the word because they are
[1:00:17] ordained to be the apostles
[1:00:19] hey man all the ones Through the Ages
[1:00:21] they were they were ordained
[1:00:24] and they responded to the word sent to
[1:00:26] them because they were the missing part
[1:00:27] of that word
[1:00:29] you understand
[1:00:30] you know it's like if I'm going to call
[1:00:32] the Queen I'm going to call the Queen
[1:00:34] and my intent is to get in touch with
[1:00:35] the queen
[1:00:36] Amy I'm not going to call I'm not going
[1:00:38] to call my next door neighbor no they're
[1:00:41] probably you know they're nice people
[1:00:42] but if I want the queen I'm going to
[1:00:44] call England I'm going to call
[1:00:45] Buckingham Palace to get the queen
[1:00:48] so if God wants the bride he's going to
[1:00:51] send a prophet that's that that's has
[1:00:53] all the gifts of Father's house and he's
[1:00:55] going to send a word out upon the Earth
[1:00:57] and then when that word registers in
[1:01:00] someone's heart it's because God is
[1:01:02] contacting his Queen
[1:01:07] so now
[1:01:09] we are called and then also you know
[1:01:12] we're we're called to you know finish
[1:01:14] the Great Commission you say how can we
[1:01:17] do that we are fulfilling the Great
[1:01:19] Commission even as we speak right now
[1:01:22] I mean some people think of some great
[1:01:23] big lofty thing sure it sounds like an
[1:01:26] incredible thing but it's just living
[1:01:27] day to day
[1:01:28] looking on you you know you know when
[1:01:30] you meet people Lord is this one of them
[1:01:32] your brother Brown says Don't Force It
[1:01:34] Down them if they're interested they'll
[1:01:36] ask you
[1:01:37] amen so if you feel the leading share it
[1:01:41] you know uh who I I don't know brother
[1:01:43] I'm sitting or something yo there's a
[1:01:45] quite yo someone said Lord fill my mouth
[1:01:48] with good things that give me a nod or
[1:01:51] something when I've said too much or
[1:01:52] when I've said enough
[1:01:54] you see so us going around no brother
[1:01:58] had to give me our testimony right yo
[1:02:00] someone's sharing with someone that is
[1:02:01] fulfilling the Great Commission
[1:02:03] amen oh that's how every day it is
[1:02:06] everyday things
[1:02:08] simple things us walking we are God's
[1:02:11] billboard
[1:02:13] us driving you know walking down the
[1:02:15] street whatever we do everyone sees you
[1:02:18] and if I and people talk about you
[1:02:21] I mean why because you're a billboard
[1:02:23] you're you're advertising you're
[1:02:25] advertising something
[1:02:27] and that's all part of fulfilling the
[1:02:28] Great Commission
[1:02:30] and then he's also called us to have a
[1:02:32] perfect union between husband and wife
[1:02:36] yo he's called us to to raise children
[1:02:39] in the love of the Lord
[1:02:41] I mean to have a real Sanctuary a bit of
[1:02:44] Eden on the Earth in our homes this is
[1:02:46] what he's called us to do all these
[1:02:48] things you know you know he's called us
[1:02:49] to you know because you know people take
[1:02:52] Prosperity Gospel and they take it way
[1:02:55] off but God said he'll Bliss
[1:02:58] amen but he'll give you the character to
[1:03:01] handle that blessing
[1:03:03] amen as well but he said I'll just bless
[1:03:07] and then so and then he's called us to
[1:03:09] be real you know what a real friend is
[1:03:12] or real Brother's Keeper
[1:03:14] I mean to be a real believer he's called
[1:03:16] us to be all these things you know Jesus
[1:03:19] said because of iniquity the love of
[1:03:21] many will wax cold
[1:03:23] so it is our responsibility that the
[1:03:26] love of God never leave us I mean
[1:03:29] individually I'm speaking because if it
[1:03:30] leaves individual it'll leave
[1:03:31] collectively but because of iniquity
[1:03:34] because iniquity affecting people the
[1:03:36] love of many will wax coal
[1:03:38] so they'll come to a point where only
[1:03:40] true love only real love is actually
[1:03:43] among the bride of Christ worldwide
[1:03:45] it'll come to a place well no I'm not
[1:03:48] talking about just well what the world
[1:03:50] calls love is not love because that's
[1:03:52] selfish love what can I get out of this
[1:03:55] situation that's not love that's being
[1:03:57] selfish
[1:03:58] but the world projects it is love but
[1:04:00] it's not real love
[1:04:02] why what's happened because only love
[1:04:04] now real love
[1:04:06] is among the bride of Christ
[1:04:09] I believe it you just go look on the you
[1:04:11] know you go look out there for a little
[1:04:13] bit you'll see true love
[1:04:15] and you know that's why there's like
[1:04:18] Pastor Beckett 43 years married I think
[1:04:20] it was yeah yeah he sent me a package
[1:04:22] you put a card in there you know they
[1:04:23] celebrate their marriage yeah 43 years
[1:04:25] and there's some others being married
[1:04:27] all that time you're like brother Greg
[1:04:28] you know they've been married I don't
[1:04:31] know maybe 40 years as well
[1:04:32] and they and they had there was a you
[1:04:34] know they went over to their neighbors
[1:04:36] had a had a meal with them and some
[1:04:38] friends and all of them like married two
[1:04:40] or three times same age
[1:04:42] why what's happened you know and that's
[1:04:44] the world just you know the devil just
[1:04:46] destroys people
[1:04:47] I'm not saying it's their fault it's the
[1:04:49] conditions they're living in
[1:04:51] but you see because there's real love
[1:04:54] it'll it'll weather storms and good
[1:04:56] times and bad times and happy and sad
[1:04:58] times but there'll be a uniting force
[1:05:01] that'll keep us together
[1:05:03] and you can see that in the older
[1:05:05] brethren
[1:05:06] amen so
[1:05:08] the devil will do everything he can I'm
[1:05:12] just going to wrap this up
[1:05:13] it's not very long but I trusted you
[1:05:15] know he'll try and derail you
[1:05:19] and he'll do everything he can to derail
[1:05:21] you and sometimes it's just a question
[1:05:24] and we just and he says well what about
[1:05:26] this and we just focus on that our whole
[1:05:29] life becomes focused on something that
[1:05:31] doesn't really you know I've got lots of
[1:05:33] questions but I don't focus on them I'd
[1:05:35] put them on the shelf and I continue to
[1:05:37] walk with God
[1:05:38] amen how does this work why does this
[1:05:41] happen I don't know he'll tell me one
[1:05:43] day if he wants if he wants me to know
[1:05:45] something he'll tell me
[1:05:47] amen I have that confidence so you know
[1:05:49] this he'll try and derail you in any way
[1:05:51] he can
[1:05:52] like he tried to do Timothy
[1:05:55] amen
[1:05:57] but it is our it is our job but but if
[1:06:01] he ever tries to do that you know
[1:06:04] brother brownie said in one place no he
[1:06:05] said in more than one place he said
[1:06:07] Sinners enticing
[1:06:09] he's just being honest sin is enticing
[1:06:12] to the Natural man
[1:06:14] you say oh how could you say that he
[1:06:16] said it
[1:06:18] amen so sin is enticing
[1:06:22] and if the devil can he'll get you
[1:06:24] derailed of something that that appears
[1:06:26] to be pleasurable
[1:06:28] amen because it's just pleasurable for a
[1:06:30] season that's why people love to do it
[1:06:33] hey come on we're people too
[1:06:36] hey man you can't say well we're holy
[1:06:38] than now and things of the world don't
[1:06:39] affect us they do whether we like it or
[1:06:41] not because we're still in these bodies
[1:06:44] amen it didn't mean when we received the
[1:06:46] Holy Ghost who come unplugged from
[1:06:48] everything and there's no trials or you
[1:06:50] know things of our past maybe we don't
[1:06:51] entice us anymore there'll be nothing in
[1:06:54] here that'll wanted
[1:06:55] but this thing still remembers it
[1:06:58] amen
[1:07:00] see he'll try and derail you on all
[1:07:01] these kinds of things
[1:07:05] but whatever you do
[1:07:07] don't forget the Divine influence
[1:07:10] that's come upon your life don't be
[1:07:13] little the bridegroom call will come
[1:07:16] right through this
[1:07:17] he said as a direct Pro he said the
[1:07:20] broken call will come right through this
[1:07:22] and if it's spoken to your heart that
[1:07:24] means yeah because a bridegroom call is
[1:07:26] a marriage call that's a uniting call
[1:07:29] and so he's saying now that this this
[1:07:32] word has come to cause you to become one
[1:07:35] with Christ an invisible Union would
[1:07:36] take place
[1:07:38] and then what happens I think something
[1:07:40] and you just responded see we need to
[1:07:42] forget
[1:07:44] you know there's land to possess there's
[1:07:46] a promised land this this thing has to
[1:07:48] come under subjection there's you know
[1:07:50] promises you know there's a there's a
[1:07:53] promised land to possess but just
[1:07:54] because we lose one battle doesn't mean
[1:07:57] we're not ordained to take the land it
[1:07:59] doesn't mean that we're not the true
[1:08:01] blue seed of God
[1:08:03] hey the Israelites you know they had the
[1:08:05] failure with AI and then they got rid of
[1:08:08] the sin out of the camp and they just
[1:08:09] continued on
[1:08:10] amen and then they took all the land
[1:08:12] that that you know yo yo with Joshua
[1:08:14] there then finally with King David they
[1:08:16] possessed the fullness of the promised
[1:08:18] land but just because they had a defeat
[1:08:20] didn't mean the you know you know
[1:08:22] because not only they just threw up and
[1:08:23] went back to Egypt threw up their hands
[1:08:25] and walked back to Egypt they just kept
[1:08:27] pressing on
[1:08:28] amen because they were looking at the
[1:08:31] promise more than their failures
[1:08:34] amen and if the devil can get you to
[1:08:37] look at your failures or you
[1:08:39] away from the promise
[1:08:41] what did he do with Timothy he would
[1:08:43] have done the same thing caused them to
[1:08:45] look at his and what he perceived as
[1:08:47] failures in himself
[1:08:49] you know
[1:08:51] the devil
[1:08:53] where do negative thoughts come from
[1:08:57] they don't come from God they come from
[1:08:59] Satan
[1:09:01] so if there's anything and remember God
[1:09:04] pulls us to himself that's why it's
[1:09:06] called the third pull it's not a push or
[1:09:09] a kick there's a drawing
[1:09:11] you've been drawn to the Lord
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:15] I'm sure there's a burden of sin that
[1:09:18] you know you know there's a burden we
[1:09:19] have to lay down
[1:09:20] but God doesn't always he points out
[1:09:23] what you should be as opposed to what
[1:09:26] you shouldn't be
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] for me he doesn't beat me down with my
[1:09:32] imperfections
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:36] but he makes them real that I can give
[1:09:38] them to him that he can mold me is a
[1:09:40] fine line
[1:09:42] amen so the devil will come your way and
[1:09:45] you'll point out what you perceive as
[1:09:46] imperfections in yourself
[1:09:48] and he'll beat you all day with them
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:53] and then what happens you're focusing on
[1:09:56] you're not focusing on the promise
[1:09:57] anymore you're focusing on what you
[1:10:00] appear as weakness
[1:10:01] but we forget that there's perfect
[1:10:03] strength and perfect weakness
[1:10:06] amen God allows us yeah look at look at
[1:10:09] the Apostle Paul he says he says he you
[1:10:12] know he is buffeted by that agent of
[1:10:13] Satan that thorn of his flesh least the
[1:10:16] abundance of Revelation that he had
[1:10:18] would would make him puffed up
[1:10:20] so God allowed that agent in his life
[1:10:24] I mean to keep him a certain way now
[1:10:26] remember he prayed and God told him this
[1:10:29] is why this is there do never never
[1:10:31] assume
[1:10:33] that what you perceive as some fading in
[1:10:36] your life is because God allowed it
[1:10:38] don't assume it
[1:10:41] you pray until God says yes or no
[1:10:44] amen but Paul he just kept walking with
[1:10:49] the Lord
[1:10:50] and he he began to Rejoice that God's
[1:10:54] strength was perfect in his weakness
[1:10:57] he didn't begin to just focus on his
[1:10:59] weakness all the time and say Paul me
[1:11:01] look at my weakness
[1:11:02] amen you know yeah
[1:11:05] there's a fight you know as I said
[1:11:07] Saturday there's a fine line between
[1:11:09] identifying a scar and nursing it and
[1:11:12] identifying a scar and being healed of
[1:11:14] it
[1:11:15] and it's the same thing with a weakness
[1:11:17] some things the Lord reveals and calls
[1:11:20] you to fail they say Lord take it from
[1:11:22] me but there's other things that he puts
[1:11:25] in you that you'll stay dependent upon
[1:11:27] him
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:30] and there's no shame in that
[1:11:33] amen but trust I but you need to pray
[1:11:37] till you know which one's which
[1:11:40] amen because some people say well the
[1:11:42] Lord you know I've heard some some
[1:11:45] brethren say well the Lord allows us in
[1:11:47] my life to keep me humble and I always
[1:11:49] think are you sure
[1:11:51] has the Lord told you that
[1:11:53] because if the Lord's told you that then
[1:11:55] praise him but but if it's something
[1:11:56] you're just kind of shielding and
[1:11:58] keeping say you need to let go of that
[1:12:00] thing
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:05] so we didn't you know this land
[1:12:08] if the devil can get us see
[1:12:10] Timothy got his eyes off the fact that
[1:12:12] he was called by God is a Divine
[1:12:15] influence upon his life it was God's
[1:12:17] purpose that he was to do the work of
[1:12:19] evangelists that God had ordained them
[1:12:21] to do these things because he came from
[1:12:23] God and he's going to go back to God
[1:12:26] this is what Timothy forgot and he was
[1:12:28] looking at his humidity his his humility
[1:12:31] and he began to withdraw and he became
[1:12:34] it has gone down the road of becoming
[1:12:36] ineffective unbelievable but but he is
[1:12:38] becoming ineffective
[1:12:40] you see because he was looking at at
[1:12:42] something carnally
[1:12:44] as in this is some problem about me as
[1:12:47] opposed to this
[1:12:49] I mean we need to look at the word Above
[1:12:52] All Things friends
[1:12:54] amen because if we take our eyes off him
[1:12:57] then then the devil really has us
[1:13:01] amen
[1:13:03] how we need to look at the word
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:07] they're up the gift
[1:13:10] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:13:12] of power love and a sound mind
[1:13:15] you know when Jesus Jesus said to the
[1:13:17] seraphenician woman
[1:13:19] that that the crumbs you know you know
[1:13:23] the other bread side so I can't remember
[1:13:25] the story exactly but you know the story
[1:13:27] Sarah Phoenician woman comes and her
[1:13:30] daughter is afflicted by a devil
[1:13:32] and she says Thou son of David have
[1:13:34] mercy on me he doesn't even respond
[1:13:36] because she was approaching him the
[1:13:38] wrong way he says Lord God
[1:13:41] be merciful
[1:13:42] and then he begins to address her
[1:13:45] and and he basically says that the dogs
[1:13:48] are not meat to eat at the table
[1:13:52] but then she says yeah but the dogs get
[1:13:54] the crumbs you know that fall down that
[1:13:57] word dog meat someone was someone that's
[1:13:59] in pure mind
[1:14:00] does not have a pure mind that's what
[1:14:02] that word dog means
[1:14:04] so he is actually calling her someone
[1:14:07] who is an impure mind
[1:14:09] so that is less to me than an animal
[1:14:11] like a dog
[1:14:13] you see but you're saying yay Lord
[1:14:16] you know
[1:14:17] sure I may be a dog to you but yeah
[1:14:21] there's still a promise
[1:14:22] the crumbs still fall that that people
[1:14:24] like us can receive what we need see she
[1:14:27] kept her focus upon the word
[1:14:29] and she got what she needed
[1:14:32] a lot of people would say how did he say
[1:14:34] I've got a second pure mind and you know
[1:14:37] they were just to you know walk the
[1:14:39] other way but because she kept her eyes
[1:14:42] on the word
[1:14:44] the Lord was testing her faith
[1:14:46] amen the Lord was testing her faith and
[1:14:50] the Lord will test your faith by
[1:14:52] allowing you to be discouraged or not
[1:14:54] being answered the way you think you
[1:14:55] should be answered
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] but because she kept her eyes on the
[1:15:01] word
[1:15:02] she didn't let it get to her that she
[1:15:04] was a dog
[1:15:05] she actually acknowledged hey I I
[1:15:07] remember your mind I don't have the mind
[1:15:09] of Christ
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:13] but she kept her eyes on the wood and
[1:15:15] she got what she needed
[1:15:17] amen how about you
[1:15:20] amen let's bow heads in the water
[1:15:22] pressure
