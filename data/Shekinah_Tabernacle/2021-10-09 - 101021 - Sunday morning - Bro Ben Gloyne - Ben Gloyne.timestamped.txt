[49:28] every spirit in here that's contrary to
[49:30] your word under your control for your
[49:31] glory and may have your way in our lives
[49:33] father in the name of jesus christ amen
[49:37] amen god bless you friends you may have
[49:39] your seats this morning uh if i could
[49:41] take a if i could take a um subject i'd
[49:44] like to speak on
[49:46] um the power of seeing you
[49:48] in the scripture
[49:50] amen when you see you when it's not just
[49:53] somebody it's you
[49:55] right so we read a scripture here of
[49:56] john 14 where the lord jesus says you
[49:59] know i have you know i would have he
[50:02] says i go to prepare a place for you
[50:05] you know it's one thing
[50:08] for a person to read jesus making that
[50:10] promise i go and prepare a place for you
[50:12] and it's not personal it could be just
[50:15] for anybody
[50:16] you know it doesn't have the same force
[50:19] when the reality of that strikes your
[50:21] soul
[50:22] right i mean it's very different see if
[50:25] it's just a scripture that's you know uh
[50:28] god hasn't made personal to you
[50:30] it can be a comfort
[50:32] it can be you know it can be a very
[50:34] comforting scripture
[50:36] it can be something that people maybe
[50:37] would like to discuss or debate or
[50:40] examine
[50:41] but that's just and and all those things
[50:43] may be good but when the word is
[50:45] quickened to you when it becomes alive
[50:48] amen it becomes personal and the you
[50:51] becomes you in the scripture
[50:53] it changes your whole life i mean it
[50:55] changes the very the very course of your
[50:57] life i mean when the lord reveals the
[51:00] scripture now we know that we should
[51:02] pray for revelation more than anything
[51:04] right not not head knowledge but
[51:06] revelation that the lord would make the
[51:08] scripture personal that when the lord
[51:10] says i i i go and prepare a place for
[51:12] you something in you says that you as me
[51:15] i mean so when you see the me and the
[51:16] you hallelujah it should change your
[51:18] whole life
[51:19] hallelujah because our god's a personal
[51:21] god he doesn't just throw a promise out
[51:23] there and just you know you know for
[51:25] people to sympathize with and maybe make
[51:27] it a nice funeral text no it's not meant
[51:29] to be that way i mean but the word the
[51:31] spirit of god is here to take his word
[51:33] anchor it in our souls i mean that it
[51:36] would change the very course of our life
[51:39] amen you know
[51:40] god we know the scripture is full of
[51:42] prophecies
[51:44] right
[51:44] when isaiah would stand and he would he
[51:47] would prophesy under the inspiration of
[51:49] the holy ghost you'd say the lord
[51:51] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[51:54] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[51:56] shall call his name emmanuel then he'd
[51:58] say a couple of chapters later for unto
[52:01] us a child is born unto us a son is
[52:03] given and the government shall be upon
[52:05] his shoulder and his name shall be
[52:07] called wonderful counsellor the mighty
[52:09] god the everlasting father the prince of
[52:11] peace i mean speaking of when when god
[52:14] would become flesh amen is jesus christ
[52:16] now those those prophecies
[52:19] when they were released for isaiah and
[52:21] the prophet told us that if isaiah
[52:23] really was conscious of what he was
[52:24] saying he wouldn't have said it but god
[52:26] just takes a vessel and bypasses their
[52:28] top two inches and uses vocal cords and
[52:31] a mouth and a tongue and speaks his word
[52:32] upon the earth and you know that that
[52:35] that prophecy prophecies can can circle
[52:37] the globe for maybe hundreds or
[52:39] thousands of years but when god releases
[52:42] a word to the earth he knows exactly
[52:44] who's going to fulfill it he knows when
[52:46] it's going to be fulfilled and he knows
[52:47] how it's going to be fulfilled so no
[52:49] doubt there would have been many devout
[52:51] sincere israelite fathers when they
[52:54] heard isaiah prophesy that or maybe they
[52:56] picked up the scroll and you know they
[52:58] read that and they thought you know my
[52:59] daughter's going to be the fulfillment
[53:01] she's going to be the virgin that's
[53:02] going to be you know you know that's
[53:03] going to conceive but you know so and
[53:06] then no doubt down through the ages it
[53:07] would have become a scripture of great
[53:09] comfort
[53:10] you know maybe when they are in babylon
[53:12] or maybe they're under the oppression of
[53:13] the romans they'd begin to read those
[53:15] scriptures and you know that find
[53:16] consolation in it you know the messiah
[53:18] is going to come
[53:20] amen a virgin's going to conceive i mean
[53:22] the prince of peace the mighty god is
[53:23] going to become flesh among us and it
[53:25] would be a great source of comfort but
[53:28] god never just intended his word just to
[53:30] be a mental comfort i remember god
[53:32] intended his word that it would put on
[53:34] flesh and live i mean so when god
[53:37] ordained that prophecy he knew exactly
[53:39] who the virgin would be
[53:41] amen many i said you know as i said many
[53:44] uh devout israelite men would have said
[53:46] it would have been their daughter but
[53:48] there was one that was going to fulfill
[53:49] it and that was mary herself she didn't
[53:52] realize she was part of the fulfillment
[53:54] when she was born but there came a
[53:56] season in her life where maybe the you
[53:59] know the rabbi one sabbath when it when
[54:01] they went to the synagogue you know
[54:03] maybe he just felt inspired to read the
[54:05] scripture and you know no doubt there
[54:07] would have been thousands of times that
[54:09] thousands of men would have read the
[54:11] same prophecy but when it comes to the
[54:13] season of fulfillment then the anointing
[54:15] comes down upon the word and it comes to
[54:18] pass so you know maybe he felt a little
[54:20] bit inspired though maybe the old rabbi
[54:22] took the scrolls and you know he just
[54:23] found inspired to read isaiah nine and
[54:26] six and you know he he maybe had no idea
[54:29] exactly who was in the in the
[54:30] congregation that morning i mean when it
[54:33] was going to be fulfilled but there was
[54:34] a little woman that was sitting there
[54:36] that she didn't realize she's part of
[54:38] the fulfillment but there she was in a
[54:41] in a predestinated time she was a
[54:43] predestinated woman at a predestinated
[54:45] moment and she was gonna hear a word
[54:47] that had been circling the earth for
[54:49] hundreds of years i mean but finally it
[54:51] was inspired upon a man to speak it amen
[54:54] and then it anchored everyone else heard
[54:56] the same word i mean but it was for her
[54:58] i mean the virgin it became personal god
[55:01] actually told her
[55:02] and her soul that's you
[55:04] i mean it became alive to her and maybe
[55:07] you know after the service you know her
[55:09] and joseph when they went back home or
[55:11] you know spent the evening together or
[55:13] the afternoon they began to talk about
[55:14] what the rabbi spoke about in the church
[55:16] and you know maybe maybe you know mary
[55:19] had a different kind of look in her eyes
[55:20] and maybe they'd begin to talk about how
[55:22] powerful what a powerful moment that was
[55:24] and you know that was kind of different
[55:26] you know the rabbi kind of stood there a
[55:27] little bit different and there's
[55:28] something in his voice that kind of you
[55:30] know is a bit different to how you you
[55:32] know usually isn't and then and then
[55:34] maybe maybe you know the um you know
[55:37] joseph got out isaiah rolled out the
[55:39] scroll and you know because mary said
[55:40] read it again
[55:42] hallelujah and then and then and then
[55:44] you know he you know he began to read it
[55:45] again the atmosphere in the room which
[55:47] you know i'm just dramatizing these
[55:48] things you know you know just to make it
[55:50] because this is what happens when we
[55:51] read the scripture and it's not just
[55:53] just for someone else it's for you
[55:55] personal i mean the atmosphere begins to
[55:57] change you know it's like an electric
[55:59] presence comes the reality of the
[56:00] scripture begins to dawn on our hearts
[56:03] is you know because it's becoming
[56:04] personal right hallelujah then mary
[56:06] would hear i mean joseph read this same
[56:09] scriptures and it was just so alive to
[56:11] her and you know she began to ponder
[56:13] those things
[56:15] because the word had gripped her
[56:17] hallelujah
[56:19] amen because the
[56:20] the you and the prophecy became the me
[56:23] right it became personal
[56:26] amen and brother abraham says here
[56:29] you know
[56:30] and while he was reading he heard a sign
[56:33] he looked sideways and the little lady
[56:34] sweetheart of of his her little face had
[56:37] flashed up her eyes was glistening like
[56:40] the stars on a dark knight said read
[56:42] that again there and he read it again
[56:44] and she must have said oh who will that
[56:46] be
[56:47] what is the prophet speaking of and he
[56:50] said something like this or would have
[56:51] said the prophet was speaking of the
[56:52] messiah which will come and one of our
[56:55] women someday will bear the messiah that
[56:57] scripture seemed to grip the little
[56:59] virgin she just couldn't get away from
[57:02] it
[57:03] amen and and and that's what she was
[57:06] studying about perhaps on this morning
[57:08] where we find she going to the well to
[57:09] get water maybe i'll say it was monday
[57:12] it was wash day she had to go get the
[57:13] wash water early her mother was old and
[57:16] as she was thinking on that scripture
[57:18] unto us the son is born unto us a child
[57:21] is given and his name shall be called
[57:23] the council the prince of peace the
[57:24] mighty god the everlasting father she
[57:26] became so interested in what she was
[57:28] saying
[57:30] i trust the scripture grips you the same
[57:32] kind of way he's become so interested in
[57:34] it
[57:35] amen or thinking until she almost forgot
[57:38] to turn the corner and as she raised her
[57:40] head there was something strange seemed
[57:42] like a light flashed and she turned down
[57:44] towards the city square where the virgin
[57:46] well stands yet today and she must have
[57:49] thought oh the sun flickered on some jew
[57:51] that's left on the side of the hill or
[57:53] maybe it hit a piece of polished metal
[57:55] somewhere or an armor of a roman soldier
[57:57] that perhaps i saw the flicker before my
[57:59] eyes so she goes on dreaming oh it's too
[58:02] bad that the church today doesn't walk
[58:04] in the spirit like that more than we do
[58:07] for that's for that's for it's that kind
[58:10] of a time when god comes to you you know
[58:13] it was on the road to emmaus when
[58:14] cleopas and his friend was speaking and
[58:17] talking and thinking about jesus that he
[58:19] walked out of the bushes by the side of
[58:21] them and talked with them while we are
[58:23] thinking upon him the trouble with the
[58:25] world today we are thinking about
[58:27] everything else but him then we wonder
[58:29] why we don't get blessings it was just a
[58:32] few weeks ago about three weeks ago when
[58:34] i sat down by some sycamore trees as i
[58:36] was telling you and begin to think it
[58:38] was there for the first time that he
[58:40] come and declared the new ministry to me
[58:42] think on him draw an eye unto me i'll
[58:44] draw and i unto you saith the lord think
[58:46] upon him
[58:47] david spoke that he was he'd write his
[58:50] commandments upon the bedpost and
[58:51] meditate on them day and night that's
[58:53] what the church ought to do would uh
[58:56] would keep your
[58:57] would keep your heart tuned in with god
[58:59] day and night for that's when he appears
[59:02] who loves those moments you just mind
[59:04] begins to wander and think about his
[59:06] goodness and how great he is and then
[59:08] the atmosphere changes what's that
[59:09] that's god drawing there
[59:11] hallelujah that's what we want don't we
[59:15] because he's a god of reality and as she
[59:18] went on walking down the street there
[59:19] was yet uh there was no one yet on the
[59:22] street as she was as she walked along
[59:24] the little dirt path for a sidewalk all
[59:26] of a sudden she began to realize there
[59:28] was something around her a real strange
[59:30] feeling oh that's the most wonderful
[59:32] experience i trust that everybody here
[59:34] has experienced them kind of at times if
[59:37] you haven't this would be a good night
[59:39] i'll say good morning to start just
[59:41] start thinking about him and worship him
[59:43] in your heart and all of a sudden you
[59:45] feel the close fellowship of the holy
[59:46] spirit all i mean all and
[59:49] hallelujah and you just can't stand
[59:51] still when it comes
[59:53] and she was thinking sorry for this long
[59:55] reading but and she was thinking not
[59:57] noticing who was around her a little
[59:58] lady perhaps with a pair of sandals on
[1:00:01] her feet walking this little dusty path
[1:00:03] just thinking of the lord and of his
[1:00:05] promises and other of things to come and
[1:00:07] as she was thinking all of a sudden that
[1:00:09] feeling got so great around her until
[1:00:10] she just raised up her head and when she
[1:00:13] did standing before her was a light and
[1:00:15] standing by the light was gabriel the
[1:00:16] angel the archangel of god if you want
[1:00:19] angels to appear to you keep your mind
[1:00:21] on god and off the things of the world
[1:00:23] go about your business go to your church
[1:00:25] go to your washing clothes whatever you
[1:00:27] are keep your mind on him all day and
[1:00:29] all night long then god will do
[1:00:31] something you're drawing close to him
[1:00:33] you've got the world shut out just you
[1:00:36] and him are together now this appearing
[1:00:38] of the angel frightened the little
[1:00:39] virgin she had been taught that the days
[1:00:41] of miracles was passed but she had seen
[1:00:43] something happen the angel told her hail
[1:00:46] mary hail means to stop for he had a
[1:00:48] message for her and when the angel comes
[1:00:51] he's got a message for you and the holy
[1:00:53] spirit god's angels here tonight i'll
[1:00:55] say this morning with a message for
[1:00:57] every believer just keep him on your
[1:00:59] mind just keep thinking about him how
[1:01:01] lovely he is how sweet he is of his
[1:01:04] promises if you're sick get this on your
[1:01:06] mind he was wounded for my
[1:01:08] transgressions he was bruised for my
[1:01:10] iniquity the chastisement of my peace
[1:01:12] was upon him and with his stripes i was
[1:01:14] healed keep your mind centered like that
[1:01:17] something will happen to you all of a
[1:01:19] sudden something drew nigh to you and
[1:01:21] anointing will come on you and out of
[1:01:23] your chair you'll go draw nigh unto the
[1:01:24] lord he'll draw nigh unto you amen
[1:01:27] hallelujah and she looked at this great
[1:01:30] angel and his name is gabriel and and
[1:01:32] there are angels of the lord many of
[1:01:34] them and they come to the earth and
[1:01:35] bring messages but gabriel when he comes
[1:01:38] there's something major going to happen
[1:01:39] he was the one who announced the first
[1:01:41] coming of christ he'll be the one that
[1:01:43] allows the second coming of christ and
[1:01:45] he told mary thou hast found favor with
[1:01:47] god what a message to bring to her thou
[1:01:50] has found favor with god and while she
[1:01:52] was thinking on that scripture then that
[1:01:54] was the scripture that was confirmed to
[1:01:56] her
[1:01:57] now if you're sick think on that
[1:01:59] scripture if you're lost think on that
[1:02:01] scripture if you want the holy ghost
[1:02:03] think on that scripture and the holy
[1:02:05] spirit will confirm it
[1:02:07] to you
[1:02:08] hallelujah it's very important we keep
[1:02:10] our mind on the lord if we want him to
[1:02:12] draw near just worship him in your heart
[1:02:14] love him amen meditate upon him and he
[1:02:17] will draw near amen and the scripture
[1:02:19] that you're that the lord leads you to
[1:02:21] think upon amen he will confirm it
[1:02:24] to you i mean so mary had heard a virgin
[1:02:26] shall conceive but then she realized she
[1:02:28] was the virgin
[1:02:29] hallelujah so the you became the me in
[1:02:31] the scripture if i can put it that way i
[1:02:33] mean so the so the virgin became her in
[1:02:35] the scripture it became personal to her
[1:02:37] amen so mary went from hearing of a
[1:02:40] virgin shallow shall conceive to
[1:02:42] realizing by revelation that she was the
[1:02:44] one to fulfill it so it went far beyond
[1:02:47] a comforting scripture that they would
[1:02:49] have read and said no that because the
[1:02:51] oppression of the romans and the hard
[1:02:53] economic times they were facing you know
[1:02:55] went far beyond just the comfort of well
[1:02:56] the messiah's going to come and fix all
[1:02:58] this and we're going to live in peace in
[1:02:59] our land again
[1:03:01] two it was more than that amen but that
[1:03:04] that the revelation came she realized
[1:03:06] i'm a
[1:03:07] part of the fulfillment of that word
[1:03:10] hallelujah and that's when when the
[1:03:11] scripture grips our souls god's telling
[1:03:14] you you're part of the fulfillment of
[1:03:16] the scripture i mean that's why this
[1:03:18] message has come to us i mean where the
[1:03:20] lord said i go to prepare a place for
[1:03:21] you and
[1:03:23] and the prophet tells us when it says
[1:03:24] that there's many in my father's kingdom
[1:03:26] and many mansions he's saying that that
[1:03:28] well my father's house has many mansions
[1:03:30] he says that that's the king james way
[1:03:32] of speaking things and we know a house
[1:03:34] in those days was referred to as a
[1:03:36] kingdom right so my k and then a mansion
[1:03:39] is not just a building of streets of
[1:03:40] gold and you know many rooms and
[1:03:42] different things but those mansions are
[1:03:44] actually eternal bodies
[1:03:45] right that we're going to step into i
[1:03:48] mean so when the lord reveals that to
[1:03:49] you what's he telling you you're part of
[1:03:51] the fulfillment amen that where i am he
[1:03:54] says up in glory amen i will come again
[1:03:57] that where i am you shall be with me
[1:03:58] amen hallelujah
[1:04:01] amen and
[1:04:02] i'm sure you could agree
[1:04:04] that would change your whole life
[1:04:06] amen you you know mary mary had the same
[1:04:09] trouble she had the same things going on
[1:04:11] in her life but she realized the
[1:04:13] messiah's coming
[1:04:14] and not just coming somewhere but
[1:04:16] through her
[1:04:17] she had found favor with god she was
[1:04:19] actually the ordained womb that the
[1:04:21] messiah would be born through
[1:04:23] hallelujah
[1:04:25] but you see now
[1:04:27] the lord's looking for our response
[1:04:30] because mary had to say to the angel in
[1:04:32] luke 1 38 be it unto me according to thy
[1:04:34] word
[1:04:36] so god's looking for a response
[1:04:38] hallelujah so we should always say amen
[1:04:42] irrespective of of how we feel about
[1:04:44] ourselves and how well we think our walk
[1:04:46] is going and i think how how good we
[1:04:48] think our day's going our years going
[1:04:50] our life's going irrespective of all
[1:04:52] those things you say yeah lord your word
[1:04:54] is true for me
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:57] amen because remember we are the clay
[1:04:58] he's the potter
[1:05:00] but the clay's got to respond to the
[1:05:01] potter amen
[1:05:03] amen i've been made in your image amen
[1:05:06] i've been made in your likeness amen
[1:05:08] hallelujah
[1:05:10] amen i'm a partaker of your divine
[1:05:11] nature amen
[1:05:13] and then with that amen with that
[1:05:15] response god begins the mould and shape
[1:05:18] oh look that's why you should never
[1:05:19] confess negative about yourself hey you
[1:05:22] may be in the worst spot of your life
[1:05:23] but the lord can reach down further than
[1:05:25] you can look up
[1:05:27] amen so we've got a we're going to
[1:05:29] testify the lord's my help he's my
[1:05:30] deliverer he's my shield my fortress my
[1:05:33] strength amen he is the shepherd
[1:05:36] hallelujah if one of the sheep's gone
[1:05:37] astray he'll go hunting that sheep
[1:05:39] hallelujah amen
[1:05:41] amen so now but the thing is so god
[1:05:44] revealed this to mary
[1:05:46] but you're gonna realize she didn't have
[1:05:48] anyone else to share this with
[1:05:50] there wasn't anyone else that was part
[1:05:52] of that event it was her and gabriel
[1:05:55] right there was no one else that
[1:05:56] received that revelation you know she
[1:05:59] had no one at first to talk about at
[1:06:02] worth
[1:06:03] and the thing is when she began to tell
[1:06:05] not everyone was rejoicing with her
[1:06:08] i mean it didn't start a universal
[1:06:09] praise and worship through israel
[1:06:11] hallelujah they weren't rejoicing it
[1:06:13] didn't just trigger a great you know
[1:06:15] everyone get back to god and throw away
[1:06:17] the creeds and traditions of man and
[1:06:19] god's going to fulfill his word and no
[1:06:21] it didn't start any of that
[1:06:23] but sometimes you know i mean well
[1:06:24] that's actually what happens
[1:06:26] god does something for someone not
[1:06:28] everyone's going to rejoice but that
[1:06:29] doesn't change what god has done
[1:06:32] amen so it couldn't change
[1:06:34] amen it did not change her testimony and
[1:06:38] and how
[1:06:39] and the reality of it to her
[1:06:41] i trust it's the same way with you
[1:06:44] doesn't matter what how people respond
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:47] you meet god
[1:06:49] jesus christ stepped out of history
[1:06:50] changed your life it doesn't change the
[1:06:52] reality of it
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] even joseph her fiat who who was her
[1:06:58] fiance
[1:06:59] when he heard the news
[1:07:01] he wasn't rejoicing and skipping
[1:07:04] he was greatly troubled
[1:07:06] i don't know how that conversation went
[1:07:07] but i don't think it ended up on a
[1:07:09] hallelujah high
[1:07:11] you know no doubt she is rejoicing she
[1:07:14] is excited i met an angel
[1:07:17] hello you know the scripture we're
[1:07:18] reading see it wasn't just an empty and
[1:07:21] you know an empty experience no she
[1:07:23] began to show signs of pregnancy
[1:07:26] there's actually a manifestation of her
[1:07:28] life that proved the supernatural was
[1:07:30] real so it wasn't just an empty thing
[1:07:32] i'm having the messiah nine months later
[1:07:34] are you sure
[1:07:35] no she had the messiah
[1:07:38] but when when when she went
[1:07:41] when she went and told joseph
[1:07:43] i doubt very much that he had a big grin
[1:07:45] on his face and was happy
[1:07:47] it says he was troubled
[1:07:51] and and sometimes this is what happens
[1:07:52] with testimony
[1:07:54] but god had to get him on board
[1:07:58] hallelujah god had to get up because he
[1:08:00] had to be a shield for her
[1:08:01] right she he had to protect them
[1:08:04] amen so so he would you know but you
[1:08:06] know no doubt he began to wrestle in his
[1:08:08] mind because he would have been marrying
[1:08:10] mary for her character she's a real lady
[1:08:14] but then she comes with this news
[1:08:16] and he's just troubled you know this had
[1:08:17] never happened before
[1:08:19] a virgin had never conceived before he
[1:08:22] couldn't go back into the sacred records
[1:08:23] and say well this prophet did this or
[1:08:25] this did this and this happened so yep
[1:08:26] this is no it never happened before
[1:08:28] though they were looking for it to
[1:08:30] happen it had never happened before so
[1:08:32] there he was trouble in his mind and
[1:08:34] wondering you know and then he came to a
[1:08:36] point his his you know the conclusion of
[1:08:38] his thought pattern
[1:08:40] was i'm just going to have to put her
[1:08:42] away privately
[1:08:43] i'm just going to break this off and
[1:08:45] maybe you know but but but i'll do it
[1:08:47] privately because i don't want to cause
[1:08:49] any more hurt and you know i'm
[1:08:50] heartbroken and you know because she's
[1:08:52] saying that if an angel visited her
[1:08:54] maybe it was a maybe a roman soldier
[1:08:56] maybe something happened in the family
[1:08:57] she's trying to cover this all up and
[1:08:59] you know but i thought she was such an
[1:09:00] honest woman and what's going on and so
[1:09:02] the conclusion of his thought process
[1:09:04] was i'm just going to break it off and
[1:09:06] then maybe even thought in his mind how
[1:09:08] he was going to do it it's not easy to
[1:09:10] raise some subjects
[1:09:13] right this is this is pretty this would
[1:09:15] be a weighty conversation this is going
[1:09:16] to change lives it's not a flippant
[1:09:18] thing just to say casually you know
[1:09:20] we're over mary see you later no this is
[1:09:22] not how it would have worked right he's
[1:09:24] a just man
[1:09:26] so but while he was thinking on these
[1:09:28] things
[1:09:30] an angel of lord appeared unto him in a
[1:09:32] dream
[1:09:33] saying joseph thou son of david fear not
[1:09:35] to take unto thee mary thy wife for that
[1:09:37] which is conceived in her is of the holy
[1:09:40] ghost i mean so now because it became
[1:09:42] personal to him
[1:09:44] hallelujah you know if you have a real
[1:09:46] testimony and it's given to a real
[1:09:48] believer god will confirm that testimony
[1:09:50] to that believer
[1:09:51] amen and this and now they can actually
[1:09:53] fellowship together because it became
[1:09:55] real to them
[1:09:58] hallelujah
[1:09:59] hallelujah
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:03] brother brown would say in jehovah of
[1:10:04] miracles oh if the church would be just
[1:10:06] like that
[1:10:08] the word settles it
[1:10:10] if god said so that's all we need to
[1:10:11] know how's it going to be i can't tell
[1:10:14] you but if god said so it's going to be
[1:10:16] that way because god said so oh that's
[1:10:19] what i want the church to know if if
[1:10:21] there's anything i want to sink
[1:10:23] faith in is in what god has said it has
[1:10:26] to be true
[1:10:28] i mean to sank into mary's heart it sank
[1:10:30] into joseph's heart it's because they
[1:10:32] became the me in the you in the
[1:10:34] scripture
[1:10:36] if i can keep putting it that way it
[1:10:37] wasn't just a out there it was to them
[1:10:40] hallelujah
[1:10:41] and i trust that
[1:10:43] the word has become real to you
[1:10:45] it's more than ink on paper it's more
[1:10:47] than it's more than a prophet's message
[1:10:49] i mean it's more than preaching it's
[1:10:51] more than just someone else saying it
[1:10:53] but but it comes alive i mean that you
[1:10:56] can hear the voice behind the voice and
[1:10:58] it anchors into your soul and it changes
[1:11:00] your life i mean every promise of god
[1:11:02] should be personal
[1:11:04] not just for someone else not just
[1:11:05] something to instagram or put on the
[1:11:06] fridge but it becomes a living reality
[1:11:09] because when it becomes a living reality
[1:11:11] your whole life will be changed i mean
[1:11:13] joseph's life went from well i'm just
[1:11:15] gonna break this off and you know
[1:11:17] maybe i have to find someone else to
[1:11:18] marry and all this his whole life
[1:11:20] changed from that one dream
[1:11:22] now i've got to protect mary
[1:11:24] hallelujah she's my wife but she's
[1:11:26] carrying emmanuel
[1:11:27] i'm going to protect the child i've got
[1:11:29] to raise you know lord help me give me
[1:11:31] wisdom
[1:11:32] oh my the messiah's in my house
[1:11:35] this is not just going to be another
[1:11:36] family i've got messiah in my house oh
[1:11:38] they should be the same way with you and
[1:11:40] i when the word becomes personal i've
[1:11:41] got messiah in me i've got the lord
[1:11:44] jesus living in me
[1:11:45] oh god give me wisdom help me lord amen
[1:11:50] you know revelation is the most
[1:11:51] important thing
[1:11:53] it can never be overemphasized the
[1:11:55] prophet tells us
[1:11:56] true revelation of the scripture
[1:11:58] can never be overemphasized
[1:12:01] we're living in a day of great storms
[1:12:03] and and chaos
[1:12:06] every opinion under the sun is just a
[1:12:08] twitter away
[1:12:10] or instagram or whatever place your
[1:12:12] social media name there it's just that
[1:12:14] away an email away a text away
[1:12:19] you know so
[1:12:20] every opinion under the sun so we need a
[1:12:22] real stability in this h
[1:12:25] and i say we need a greater stability
[1:12:27] than any other age is needed
[1:12:29] why because this is the age where my my
[1:12:32] voice can go around the world
[1:12:34] every country under heaven who's got a
[1:12:36] internet connection could could could
[1:12:38] plug into this service right now
[1:12:41] so it's never been that way before
[1:12:44] but if the word becomes alive to us
[1:12:46] because remember only god's word is
[1:12:48] eternal heavens and earth will pass away
[1:12:50] my my word will not pass away
[1:12:53] so if we could just yield ourselves to
[1:12:55] his word
[1:12:56] not what's going on in our mind spirits
[1:12:59] plagueis mind battles whatever more but
[1:13:01] if we just anchor into his word and let
[1:13:03] god make it alive to us you know when i
[1:13:05] met the lord well before i met him i
[1:13:07] just realized i can meet jesus
[1:13:10] if he's alive because this this book
[1:13:12] tells me the term's empty
[1:13:14] he says i'll be with you even in you to
[1:13:16] the end of the world and i heard a
[1:13:18] prophet say he's here
[1:13:20] and then god come down and vindicate
[1:13:22] what that prophet said and say jesus
[1:13:24] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:13:25] forever it just anchored into my little
[1:13:27] heart i can meet jesus
[1:13:30] so if i can meet him lord come meet me
[1:13:33] change my heart that i can meet you and
[1:13:35] he changed my life amen and i met him he
[1:13:38] changed my life forever
[1:13:40] hallelujah amen you know so
[1:13:43] jesus can be met
[1:13:44] who can testify of that
[1:13:46] you can actually meet jesus he said i've
[1:13:48] met him i know
[1:13:51] amen
[1:13:53] see with joseph though before he had
[1:13:55] that dream
[1:13:58] that's when reasoning can come in
[1:14:01] because if the scripture is not a
[1:14:03] revelation
[1:14:05] then the devil will use reasoning to
[1:14:07] explain away the fulfillment
[1:14:10] and that's why he came to the conclusion
[1:14:12] i'll just put her away privately
[1:14:15] because reasoning began to kick in
[1:14:17] this can't be true this can't be
[1:14:19] happening this way what she said it just
[1:14:21] seems she's amazing girl that's why i'm
[1:14:22] marrying her but you know it's just too
[1:14:24] fantastic it's just two and they begin
[1:14:26] to reason well what's the conclusion
[1:14:28] well obviously a virgin can't can't
[1:14:30] conceive so it must have been another
[1:14:32] man and she's been with another man so
[1:14:33] i'm just gonna put it away yeah but it
[1:14:35] was the devil was using reasoning
[1:14:37] to explain away the fulfillment and the
[1:14:40] devil's got a lot of reasoning he's had
[1:14:42] thousands of years
[1:14:44] i mean to to to hone down reasoning he's
[1:14:46] very good at reasoning his reasoning
[1:14:48] isn't actually it sounds very reasonable
[1:14:51] that's why a lot of people fall for his
[1:14:53] lies
[1:14:54] amen he started reasoning up in heaven
[1:14:56] that's where sin started when he
[1:14:57] preached through the angels and and his
[1:14:59] reasoning that i can make a better
[1:15:01] kingdom than god
[1:15:03] amen resonated i'll use a buzz buzzword
[1:15:06] yo you get emails and and people say
[1:15:08] this resonated with me okay you're on
[1:15:10] that frequency you know you know but it
[1:15:13] resonated with some angels and now
[1:15:15] they've become devils because they fell
[1:15:17] from their first estate so he's very
[1:15:19] good with with reasoning but that's why
[1:15:21] the scripture says for us to cast down
[1:15:23] reasoning
[1:15:25] amen because the word is true we should
[1:15:27] stick with what the word says
[1:15:29] but the thing is because it wasn't a
[1:15:31] revelation to joseph
[1:15:33] the devil used reasoning to try and
[1:15:35] explain it away
[1:15:36] amen and basically try and make him
[1:15:39] break off the engagement but then god
[1:15:41] and his sovereign grace stepped on the
[1:15:43] scene amen and revealed himself
[1:15:45] hallelujah amen so
[1:15:48] now brother brown says in the church age
[1:15:50] book he says the importance of
[1:15:51] revelation by the spirit to a true
[1:15:53] believer can never be over emphasized
[1:15:56] the importance of revelation by the
[1:15:59] spirit to a true believer can never be
[1:16:01] over emphasized revelation what is that
[1:16:04] when the word becomes personal and alive
[1:16:06] to you it's not something you work out
[1:16:08] it's not a nice feeling but it becomes
[1:16:11] anchored in your soul you know it's true
[1:16:13] just like healing when the revelation
[1:16:15] that you're healed anchors in your heart
[1:16:17] you know you're healed
[1:16:19] it's not i hope so and i hope it's going
[1:16:21] to work you know
[1:16:23] it's been revealed
[1:16:25] amen just like when the lord reveals to
[1:16:26] you that he died for you on calvary
[1:16:28] you're not hoping that your sins are
[1:16:29] washed away you know because he reveals
[1:16:32] it it becomes a personal story to you
[1:16:34] it's not just something that someone
[1:16:35] says but god reveals i hang between
[1:16:38] heavens and earth i took your punishment
[1:16:40] upon myself i took your sin upon myself
[1:16:43] i mean i became a sinner i took your
[1:16:45] sins down to hell as a sinner that you
[1:16:47] don't have to go there but you can go
[1:16:48] into life eternal
[1:16:50] hallelujah
[1:16:52] amen that's why we should pray for those
[1:16:54] things it becomes real who wants god to
[1:16:56] be personal
[1:16:58] right who wasn't who well you should say
[1:17:00] lord become real to me reveal who you
[1:17:02] are to me and if you have a sincere
[1:17:04] heart god will show you
[1:17:06] himself to you
[1:17:07] so can it be never overemphasized
[1:17:09] revelation means more to you than
[1:17:11] perhaps you realize now i'm not talking
[1:17:13] about just this book of revelation and
[1:17:15] you i'm talking about all revelation it
[1:17:18] is tremendously important to the church
[1:17:21] do you remember mark 16 where jesus
[1:17:23] asked the disciples this question who do
[1:17:25] men say that i the son of man am and
[1:17:28] they said some say thou art john the
[1:17:29] baptist some say elias and others
[1:17:31] jeremias or one of the prophets he saith
[1:17:34] unto them but whom say ye that i am and
[1:17:37] simon peter answered and said thou art
[1:17:38] the christ the son of the living god and
[1:17:41] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:17:43] art thou simon by jonah for flesh and
[1:17:46] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[1:17:47] my father which is in heaven and i say
[1:17:50] unto thee that thou art peter and upon
[1:17:52] this rock i'll build my church and the
[1:17:54] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:17:56] it the roman catholics say that the
[1:17:58] church is built upon peter now that's
[1:18:00] really carnal how can god build the
[1:18:02] church upon a man so unstable that he
[1:18:04] denied the lord jesus and cursed while
[1:18:06] doing it god can't build his church upon
[1:18:08] any man born in sin and it isn't some
[1:18:11] rock laying there as a god has hallowed
[1:18:13] the ground at that spot and it isn't
[1:18:15] that what the present protestants say
[1:18:18] that the church is built upon jesus no
[1:18:20] it is it was the revelation read it the
[1:18:22] way it was written flesh and blood has
[1:18:24] not revealed it but my father hath
[1:18:27] revealed it and upon this rock the
[1:18:29] revelation of who jesus christ is i'll
[1:18:31] build my church and the the church is
[1:18:34] built on revelation
[1:18:36] on thus saith the lord amen so we can
[1:18:39] never overemphasize the importance of
[1:18:40] revelation
[1:18:42] amen he would say this he says look at
[1:18:44] it this way
[1:18:45] too many read the bible where it says in
[1:18:47] acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every
[1:18:49] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[1:18:51] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:18:53] receive the gift of the holy ghost and
[1:18:55] just pass right on they don't see it if
[1:18:57] they saw it by getting in the spirit
[1:19:00] they would know that if you want to
[1:19:01] receive the holy spirit they need to
[1:19:03] repent to be baptized in the name of the
[1:19:05] lord jesus and then god will be duty
[1:19:08] bound to fulfill his word by filling
[1:19:10] them with the holy ghost they never get
[1:19:12] in his spirit or it would happen to them
[1:19:14] exactly as the word says pray to god for
[1:19:17] a revelation by his spirit that is the
[1:19:20] first step get in the spirit
[1:19:24] amen he says don't go through the acts
[1:19:26] first get in the spirit and then go
[1:19:28] through the acts and watch what god will
[1:19:30] do
[1:19:31] amen that's why we've got to get in the
[1:19:32] spirit that's why it's so important
[1:19:34] enjoy the song service enter in
[1:19:37] hallelujah don't just you know just
[1:19:38] enter in and just just love them from
[1:19:40] your heart
[1:19:41] what happens then you get in the spirit
[1:19:43] then god can begin to work
[1:19:45] hallelujah
[1:19:47] now he says have you ever noticed how
[1:19:48] the world gets into the spirit of things
[1:19:50] that are in the world they go to their
[1:19:52] ball games their sporting events and
[1:19:53] their dances they enter into the spirit
[1:19:55] of it they don't just sit there like
[1:19:57] wall flowers all dried up sticks they
[1:19:59] enter right into the feel of things and
[1:20:01] become part of things but oh how they
[1:20:04] hate the christians for getting into the
[1:20:05] spirit of god's word they call us
[1:20:07] fanatics and holy rollers there is
[1:20:09] nothing they won't do to show their
[1:20:11] hatred and disapproval but ignore that
[1:20:14] you can expect it knowing where it's
[1:20:16] coming from just go right on and get in
[1:20:18] the spirit of worship our spirit is
[1:20:20] clean it's fresh it's real it is sober
[1:20:23] and serious but not but nonetheless full
[1:20:26] of the joy of the lord the christian
[1:20:28] ought to be just as exuberant and full
[1:20:30] of his pleasure in the lord as the world
[1:20:32] is when it saviors and delights and its
[1:20:34] pleasures
[1:20:35] amen both christians in the world are
[1:20:37] human both have emotions the difference
[1:20:40] is the christian's heart and emotions
[1:20:41] are purely on the lord of glory and his
[1:20:43] love while the world satisfies the flesh
[1:20:46] i mean so when you see people dressed up
[1:20:49] you know come painted head to toe in
[1:20:50] black and you know at the all blacks and
[1:20:52] cheering and shouting and it can be
[1:20:54] freezing weather amen hey we should be
[1:20:56] that just that same kind of way amen hey
[1:20:59] they get excited about about a bit of
[1:21:01] synthetic rubber that's being chased
[1:21:03] around the field i mean how much more
[1:21:05] eternal life amen when we gather we
[1:21:07] begin to worship and praise god that
[1:21:09] god's going to take us up into glory i
[1:21:11] mean that should make us exuberant and
[1:21:12] happy hallelujah amen amen but the devil
[1:21:16] said it tells us to shh
[1:21:19] and we say no you shh
[1:21:21] amen you got to tell him
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:26] hallelujah
[1:21:27] amen but we're going to get into the
[1:21:28] spirit now i'm not saying we don't but
[1:21:29] i'm just hey there's more power
[1:21:32] and being in the spirit than we realize
[1:21:34] where the scripture says that god
[1:21:36] inhabits the praises of his people i
[1:21:38] mean you think about when you begin to
[1:21:40] praise god from your heart now how it's
[1:21:42] manifested that's that depends on the
[1:21:45] individual but what's going on in here
[1:21:48] amen but let it come out
[1:21:50] hallelujah what do you think when you're
[1:21:52] really going to praise god from your
[1:21:53] heart he begins to inhabit that praise
[1:21:56] hillary and just imagine and it's not
[1:21:58] just one person that god inhabits that
[1:22:00] praise now it's the whole church so god
[1:22:02] inhabits the praise of every believer
[1:22:04] hallelujah and the bible says the
[1:22:06] anointing breaks the yoke
[1:22:08] i mean the anointing breaks the yoke i
[1:22:10] mean so you see you just imagine now you
[1:22:12] think about the power of really praise
[1:22:14] god inhabits that praise his anointing
[1:22:16] comes down and it can break the yoke of
[1:22:18] the devil off every life
[1:22:21] that's why it's so powerful i meant to
[1:22:22] worship in the spirit
[1:22:25] amen we should never diminish these
[1:22:27] things because he said oh lord i want to
[1:22:28] see yokes broken i want more of you god
[1:22:31] there's more of me i mean there's things
[1:22:33] in my life i want dealt with just begin
[1:22:35] to praise and worship god
[1:22:37] hallelujah
[1:22:40] amen now
[1:22:42] he would say this
[1:22:44] brother brown would say this in the you
[1:22:45] know i'm sorry if i'm jumping around a
[1:22:47] bit but
[1:22:48] brother bam says in the seventh seal he
[1:22:50] says now when the supernatural comes in
[1:22:53] that's the mind of christ
[1:22:55] don't become so
[1:22:57] you become so far away from your own
[1:22:59] thinking
[1:23:00] amen so he's saying that when this went
[1:23:02] so so when god comes and the
[1:23:03] supernatural comes in that's the mind of
[1:23:05] christ
[1:23:06] now in this age we live in
[1:23:08] we need to be stabilized
[1:23:10] right a big stability or the massive
[1:23:13] stability that god puts in our life is
[1:23:15] revelation
[1:23:16] right if you realize that you're a son
[1:23:18] or daughter of god that gives you a
[1:23:20] stability i mean you can swim against
[1:23:22] the tide you don't have to go with the
[1:23:24] crowd i mean you don't have to do what
[1:23:26] everyone else is doing conform to social
[1:23:28] norms no you don't have to do that
[1:23:29] because your identity is not based on
[1:23:31] society it's not based on what's on the
[1:23:33] world wide web i mean but your
[1:23:35] identity's in the word
[1:23:37] i mean it gives a real stability
[1:23:40] right but the thing is now if we want
[1:23:42] that stability to manifest then we need
[1:23:44] the mind of christ
[1:23:46] hallelujah and so when the holy ghost
[1:23:48] comes down the supernatural in prayer
[1:23:51] it'll give us the mind of christ
[1:23:53] right because we can have our mind made
[1:23:55] up just like just like um joseph was
[1:23:58] going to put mary away privately
[1:24:01] that was his mind operating his
[1:24:03] reasoning but then the supernatural came
[1:24:05] down into his dream
[1:24:06] and that what the angel said was the
[1:24:08] mind of christ don't take don't fear to
[1:24:11] take into the mirror thy wife for that
[1:24:12] which is a conceivables of the holy
[1:24:14] ghost why because the word being
[1:24:16] manifested in that day
[1:24:17] amen so the mind of christ was coming
[1:24:19] down to him in that dream in the
[1:24:20] supernatural
[1:24:23] it's so important that we stay in a in a
[1:24:26] in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:24:29] and we can because of the blood of jesus
[1:24:30] christ god doesn't just want to visit us
[1:24:32] time to time he wants to make his abode
[1:24:35] hallelujah
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:38] so we need the mind of christ
[1:24:42] in this age i'm sure we can agree i
[1:24:44] don't need my own mind
[1:24:46] i don't need someone else's mind i need
[1:24:48] the mind of christ
[1:24:51] amen now jesus prayed often
[1:24:55] he did so to stand fellowship with the
[1:24:57] father that was in him
[1:24:59] then we read there in john 14.
[1:25:02] he said believe not that i am in the
[1:25:04] father the father and me the words that
[1:25:06] i speak unto you i speak not of myself
[1:25:08] but the father that dwelleth in me he do
[1:25:10] it the works so he stay had to stay in
[1:25:13] fellowship with the god that was in him
[1:25:16] if he did that do you think and and he
[1:25:19] was he was the virgin born son of god
[1:25:21] born without sin he had because remember
[1:25:23] he had to limit himself like a man to
[1:25:25] demonstrate this is how human mankind
[1:25:27] should be
[1:25:29] but but but if he understand if he was
[1:25:31] in prayer to stay in fellowship to be
[1:25:33] led
[1:25:34] what about sinners saved by grace like
[1:25:35] us
[1:25:39] now the amount of prayer
[1:25:42] i'm not talking about time limits here
[1:25:44] you can be
[1:25:45] hours or you can be a few moments but
[1:25:47] god comes down gives the answer changes
[1:25:49] your whole life you just walk on
[1:25:51] so it's not about i talk about the
[1:25:52] quality of prayer
[1:25:54] not necessarily you know it's man's
[1:25:56] works to be well i pray two hours every
[1:25:57] day that can be man's works
[1:26:00] that can just be quantity what about
[1:26:01] quality hey if you're quantity go for it
[1:26:04] pray all you want you know don't but but
[1:26:06] but just don't don't humanly do it
[1:26:10] as a yeah but but pray we should pray
[1:26:13] i trust this comes out right because i
[1:26:14] don't want to have your prayer warrior
[1:26:16] pray on if you want to talk to your lord
[1:26:18] just tell him all day how great he is
[1:26:20] just pray on
[1:26:21] hallelujah you know so every prayer is
[1:26:23] worth it
[1:26:25] hallelujah
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:28] but now he says in philippians here
[1:26:31] rejoice in the lord always again i say
[1:26:33] rejoice let your moderation be known
[1:26:36] unto all men the lord is at hand be
[1:26:38] careful for nothing but an eve but by
[1:26:41] but in everything by prayer and
[1:26:42] supplication with thanksgiving let your
[1:26:45] request be made known unto god
[1:26:47] amen so in everything by prayer and
[1:26:50] supplication with thanksgiving
[1:26:52] let your request be made known unto god
[1:26:54] you know it's very interesting in the
[1:26:56] gospels where jesus never taught the
[1:26:58] apostles how to preach
[1:27:00] he never taught them how to sing
[1:27:02] but he taught them how to pray
[1:27:05] amen so to me it's very important it's
[1:27:08] vital prayer brother rahm says we can
[1:27:10] sing too much
[1:27:11] we can talk too much i could say we
[1:27:13] could even preach too much
[1:27:15] but we can never pray
[1:27:16] too much
[1:27:19] amen why because prayer should change
[1:27:21] your mind to match god's mind
[1:27:23] it's not necessary saying now do this
[1:27:25] and heal this lord and do this all those
[1:27:26] things are good that's supplication but
[1:27:28] should we pray shall we change our mind
[1:27:30] lord to match your mind
[1:27:32] i mean so what you want done in my life
[1:27:34] because god's interested in our lives
[1:27:36] he is not he's not vague when it comes
[1:27:38] to our lives he he is interested in the
[1:27:40] details of our life while we go through
[1:27:42] what we're facing and he wants to guide
[1:27:44] us through every challenge
[1:27:47] right so
[1:27:48] in everything by prayer and supplication
[1:27:51] he says finally brethren whatsoever
[1:27:52] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:27:54] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:27:56] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:27:58] things are lovely what's all the things
[1:28:00] of a good report if there be any virtue
[1:28:02] if there be any praise think on these
[1:28:05] things
[1:28:06] those things which ye have both learned
[1:28:09] and received and heard and seen in me do
[1:28:11] and the god of peace shall be with you
[1:28:14] who wants the god of peace to be with
[1:28:15] them
[1:28:17] hallelujah when we think of the armor of
[1:28:19] god many times we just think of six
[1:28:22] things
[1:28:23] we think of now if i have these i nearly
[1:28:25] missed out one last night but you know
[1:28:27] so being good about with truth now we
[1:28:29] know the armor of god to begin with is
[1:28:30] the baptism of the holy ghost our armor
[1:28:32] is within us
[1:28:34] right it's not it's not a rosary prayer
[1:28:36] we say i'm putting on the helmet of
[1:28:37] salvation today lord and being good
[1:28:38] about with truth now i've got the breast
[1:28:40] plate of no it's in you by the holy
[1:28:42] ghost so we're fully armed
[1:28:44] amen
[1:28:45] this is the best kind of armor
[1:28:47] man can't touch this armor all of
[1:28:49] science can't develop this kind of armor
[1:28:51] that we have in the and these weapons
[1:28:53] but so
[1:28:55] many times we think about just being six
[1:28:56] things good about with truth the
[1:28:58] breastplate of righteousness feet shot
[1:29:01] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:29:02] peace the shield of faith the helmet of
[1:29:04] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:29:07] but six is not god's number
[1:29:10] seven is god's number and what the armor
[1:29:13] of god is capped off with is prayer
[1:29:18] because
[1:29:23] he would say here
[1:29:25] not sure where that's gone but we can go
[1:29:27] to ephesians 6 and we can read it
[1:29:38] galatians ephesians chapter six
[1:29:41] i'm going to try and
[1:29:43] i feel like time is running away now
[1:29:46] ephesians 6 12 down to 17
[1:29:50] it talks about the armor of god what we
[1:29:52] wrestle against and put on the hammer of
[1:29:55] putting on the whole armor of god but
[1:29:57] then verse 18 if we go to verse 18
[1:30:00] after after the arm has been listed it
[1:30:02] says praying always with all prayer and
[1:30:04] supplication
[1:30:06] in the spirit and watching there unto
[1:30:08] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:30:10] for all saints
[1:30:12] so that caps off the whole armor because
[1:30:14] you can say prayer actually puts the
[1:30:16] armor into action
[1:30:18] hallelujah you take the shield of faith
[1:30:20] amen the shield of revelation the fiery
[1:30:22] darts the enemy come along you know this
[1:30:24] person said this and they thought this
[1:30:26] and this happens here and this you know
[1:30:28] what how do you combat those things
[1:30:30] take it to the lord in prayer
[1:30:32] lord they didn't really mean this this
[1:30:34] is this and you and then and then
[1:30:36] because brother ram says when you really
[1:30:37] go into prayer about somebody and you're
[1:30:39] really in prayer you go up into the
[1:30:41] presence of god with that person then
[1:30:43] the lord shows shows you actually why
[1:30:45] they are that way
[1:30:46] and then when you come down
[1:30:48] after that you don't there's no ill
[1:30:50] feeling there's just love and concern
[1:30:52] and you want to pray for them more
[1:30:55] amen so prayer
[1:30:57] caps off the whole armor
[1:31:00] that's why
[1:31:02] we need to stay
[1:31:04] in prayer
[1:31:06] now we're living in dangerous and
[1:31:07] treacherous times
[1:31:09] but the lord has already equipped us
[1:31:12] to go through them
[1:31:14] brother was saying christ is revealed in
[1:31:16] his own word
[1:31:17] now when i talk about a ship here it's
[1:31:19] you
[1:31:21] right we're actually individual sure
[1:31:22] there's the gospel ship we got on or the
[1:31:24] gospel train but we're an individual
[1:31:27] boat
[1:31:28] fellowship is two people in a boat us
[1:31:30] and god
[1:31:31] and the boat is small enough you've got
[1:31:32] to be with each other the whole time
[1:31:35] hallelujah
[1:31:36] amen so when i'm talking about it when
[1:31:38] brother man speaks about a ship don't
[1:31:40] think about just the bride around the
[1:31:41] world as in this gospel ship don't this
[1:31:43] is you and god
[1:31:45] because remember our walk is individual
[1:31:48] now the stabilizers has been put on the
[1:31:50] ship
[1:31:51] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:31:53] us but we know just beyond that wave
[1:31:56] yonder we're nearing the shore see we're
[1:31:58] nearing the shore what's the show that's
[1:32:00] eternity that's the rapture
[1:32:03] just stay
[1:32:06] stabilized just stay in the word stay
[1:32:08] with god no matter how you feel what any
[1:32:12] things else stay right with the word
[1:32:15] let it stay stable when you see all
[1:32:18] these great old uh big old clouds around
[1:32:20] us storms coming and and atomic bombs
[1:32:23] and everything else that they're talking
[1:32:24] about
[1:32:25] but our stabilizer is stay is right
[1:32:28] straight in the word god said it would
[1:32:30] be here we'll crest every one of them
[1:32:32] yeah we'll go right over the top of them
[1:32:34] yes indeed
[1:32:36] they they can't sink us they can't join
[1:32:38] us you put us pardon me in the grave uh
[1:32:41] we'll come out again
[1:32:43] that's just all there is to it there
[1:32:45] ain't no way in the world to keep it
[1:32:47] down there we'll crest every one of them
[1:32:49] because our great chief captain is
[1:32:51] calling it the other
[1:32:52] side no i probably told the story but
[1:32:55] back in my who's who's 12 here around
[1:32:58] that age now when i was this age
[1:33:01] i was i was sailing
[1:33:03] there in poverty bay in gisborne it'd be
[1:33:05] like two meter swells and you know
[1:33:07] there'd be times when you'd be sailing
[1:33:09] along and the boat would would would um
[1:33:11] would pitch pole so you'd be and so the
[1:33:14] bow would dive in and the boat would go
[1:33:16] this way and you'd go this way
[1:33:19] and you had to start swimming after your
[1:33:20] boat because your boat's being pushed by
[1:33:22] the wind because the bottom of the the
[1:33:24] hull's actually up like this it's going
[1:33:26] like this eventually it goes over but
[1:33:28] you know
[1:33:29] there's a lot of waves i submarine
[1:33:30] through
[1:33:31] right there's a lot of times i went this
[1:33:33] way the boat went that way i had to swim
[1:33:35] after my boat
[1:33:36] but i i'm still alive
[1:33:39] well that's pretty obvious because
[1:33:40] you're here no but i'm still alive
[1:33:42] there's sharks in that bay dangerous
[1:33:44] things that bay
[1:33:46] but i had a life jacket on
[1:33:49] hallelujah and it wasn't me keeping
[1:33:51] myself buoyant that life jacket was
[1:33:53] keeping me buoyant doesn't matter what
[1:33:55] storm and conditions i was sailing
[1:33:56] through i'm still here
[1:33:59] amen and that's like the same thing with
[1:34:01] stabilizers
[1:34:02] it's the stabilizers will hold you
[1:34:04] stable in every storm doesn't matter how
[1:34:07] big the wave is
[1:34:08] hallelujah you may submarine through it
[1:34:11] you're going to go through it
[1:34:13] amen but we've got to have we're going
[1:34:15] to be stabilized now he's the prophet is
[1:34:17] telling us that the stabilizers have
[1:34:19] been put on the ship
[1:34:21] but we've got to depend upon the
[1:34:23] stabilizers
[1:34:24] what if i was out there as a 12 year old
[1:34:26] boy
[1:34:28] kilometers from land
[1:34:30] and i've and i've just capsized and then
[1:34:32] i'm panicking because you know my life
[1:34:34] jacket's not going to work
[1:34:36] i'd be a mess i'm going to die
[1:34:39] but i had confidence in my stabilizer if
[1:34:42] i use that analogy a confidence in my
[1:34:44] life jacket we're gonna have confidence
[1:34:47] in our stabilizer in this day
[1:34:50] i mean now these storms that the prophet
[1:34:52] was speaking about to me
[1:34:54] they are evil spirits that are running
[1:34:56] rampant in the end time
[1:34:58] right this is what these are these are
[1:34:59] not abstract you know what we've really
[1:35:01] got to do
[1:35:02] is we're going to take the word and say
[1:35:03] lord take it from being abstract idea
[1:35:06] and bring it down into my everyday life
[1:35:08] that it can apply because everything
[1:35:09] applies to us the seals apply to us
[1:35:13] amen the trumpets applied you know
[1:35:15] there's practical things in it i mean
[1:35:16] the face of you know the levitical
[1:35:19] feasts the seven feasts that applies to
[1:35:21] us they may seem abstract ideas but it
[1:35:23] comes down into our life
[1:35:25] so
[1:35:26] we said lord says should be lord make it
[1:35:29] make it that i could apply this
[1:35:31] i'm just talking to me man you know but
[1:35:33] yeah because it's got to be it's going
[1:35:34] to be more than all these big storms
[1:35:36] well what's the storm you know because
[1:35:38] if we say there's a storm outside
[1:35:41] it'll consist of a lot of wind
[1:35:43] a lot of rain
[1:35:44] and we kind of have an idea of the
[1:35:46] damage those things can do
[1:35:48] right you think tornado well you've seen
[1:35:50] footage of tornadoes or hurricanes or
[1:35:52] whatever
[1:35:53] you know but it's not some abstract idea
[1:35:56] it's really happened
[1:35:59] so it should be the same thing when when
[1:36:02] the prophet says there's great storms
[1:36:04] we are facing and great big clouds and
[1:36:06] different things now it's not a um it's
[1:36:10] not a mystery when i talk about atomic
[1:36:11] bombs and nuclear war we know that's
[1:36:13] gonna happen but there's other storms
[1:36:14] that we've got to go through and brother
[1:36:16] mcs before the first bomb drops the
[1:36:18] bride's out of here
[1:36:20] but there's storms that we are facing
[1:36:22] now i don't know if you've realized but
[1:36:24] we're actually living in a hurricane
[1:36:26] this world is a hurricane
[1:36:28] of of demon power
[1:36:31] but greater that is in you that is in
[1:36:33] the hurricane
[1:36:34] that is in the storm
[1:36:36] so we don't need to be afraid
[1:36:38] you know we've already got the armor
[1:36:41] that doesn't matter what the wind blows
[1:36:42] our way it's just going to go
[1:36:44] and go off you know what was that i
[1:36:45] don't know praise the lord i'm still
[1:36:47] here
[1:36:49] but
[1:36:50] so to me its demon powers are running
[1:36:52] amuck in the end time now
[1:36:53] brother brown i mean sorry the apostle
[1:36:55] paul would say in ephesians 4
[1:36:57] it says until we all come to the unity
[1:36:59] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:37:01] son of god unto a perfect man until the
[1:37:03] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:37:05] of christ in ephesians 4 and 14 that we
[1:37:08] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:37:10] and fro and carried about with every
[1:37:12] wind of doctrine by the slight of men
[1:37:15] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:37:17] and wait to deceive now
[1:37:20] when it comes to every wind of doctrine
[1:37:23] it's not just christians or religion
[1:37:25] that has doctrine
[1:37:27] atheism is a doctrine
[1:37:30] evolution is a doctrine it's not a
[1:37:32] theory
[1:37:33] it's a doctrine
[1:37:36] so every
[1:37:37] socialism is a doctrine
[1:37:39] communism is a doctrine
[1:37:41] any teaching is well adoption is a
[1:37:43] teaching so it's not just a religious
[1:37:46] thing it's actually the whole world
[1:37:48] transhumanism
[1:37:49] people want to merge man and machine
[1:37:51] together that they become immortal
[1:37:53] that's a teaching
[1:37:54] people are actually investing their
[1:37:56] energy and life to actually make it
[1:37:57] happen why because it's a doctrine
[1:38:00] but with every doctrine there's a spirit
[1:38:02] attached to that doctrine
[1:38:04] because spirits travel on words
[1:38:07] jesus will say in john 6 and 63 it is
[1:38:10] the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:38:11] profiteth nothing the words that i speak
[1:38:13] unto you thy spirit and their life
[1:38:16] so what was he doing he was teaching
[1:38:18] them there was doctrine coming out
[1:38:20] that was with power of the holy ghost
[1:38:21] i'm kind of slowing down because i just
[1:38:23] want to i don't want this just to pass
[1:38:25] us by
[1:38:26] maybe past me but i don't know but you
[1:38:28] know but so doctrine is a teaching and
[1:38:31] this spirit's attached to doctrine
[1:38:33] and to me now this is part of the great
[1:38:35] storm of this hurricane of this world
[1:38:37] that we're living in is this every wind
[1:38:39] of doctrine is blowing around
[1:38:42] and i'm not just talking within the
[1:38:43] message circles i'm talking about the
[1:38:44] whole world
[1:38:48] now people's lives
[1:38:51] are a manifestation of the doctrine they
[1:38:53] believe
[1:38:54] whether they're aware of it or not
[1:38:57] so adoption you believe is something you
[1:38:59] agree with
[1:39:01] and the devil twists our minds to say
[1:39:04] things are acceptable
[1:39:06] that's why we do them
[1:39:08] right
[1:39:08] if the world do not think what they do
[1:39:10] is acceptable they wouldn't do it
[1:39:14] if they thought it was actually wrong
[1:39:16] and they knew the penalty behind it they
[1:39:18] wouldn't do it
[1:39:19] so i pray that our lives are a
[1:39:22] manifestation of the doctrine of the
[1:39:23] scripture of the message right because
[1:39:26] if we have pure doctrine then we have
[1:39:28] the holy ghost living in our lives
[1:39:31] amen so now
[1:39:32] if we go to romans chapter 1
[1:39:36] the apostle paul speaks of a
[1:39:38] process where people
[1:39:41] fall from worshiping god
[1:39:44] into a very dark and deprived state
[1:39:48] now
[1:39:49] this has happened in this time too
[1:39:51] history has repeated itself he's not
[1:39:52] just pointing backwards it's actually
[1:39:54] right now
[1:39:57] now when i read this i want you to
[1:39:59] pick up on two things
[1:40:01] they weren't thankful
[1:40:03] they glorified him not as god
[1:40:05] and they didn't want to retain god in
[1:40:07] their knowledge
[1:40:09] okay so we go to romans 1 and 18. for
[1:40:11] the wrath of god is revealed from heaven
[1:40:13] against all ungodliness and
[1:40:15] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:40:17] truth in unrighteousness so they think
[1:40:19] the truth is unrighteous they're not
[1:40:20] interested in it because they because
[1:40:23] that which may be known of god is
[1:40:25] manifest because that which may be known
[1:40:27] of god is manifest in them for god has
[1:40:30] showed it unto them for the invisible
[1:40:32] things of him from the creation of the
[1:40:34] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:40:36] by the things that are made even his
[1:40:38] eternal power and godhead so that they
[1:40:41] are without excuse remember brother
[1:40:42] braham said his first bible was nature
[1:40:45] he could see god in nature and anyone
[1:40:48] anyone who really looks into nature they
[1:40:49] should be able to see god
[1:40:53] for the invisible things
[1:40:55] of him from the creation of the world
[1:40:56] are clearly seen being understood by the
[1:40:58] things that are made so i'm just
[1:40:59] repeating this again even as eternal
[1:41:01] power and godhead so that they are
[1:41:03] without excuse because that when they
[1:41:05] knew god they glorified him not as god
[1:41:08] neither were they neither were thankful
[1:41:10] we've got to stay thankful
[1:41:12] amen and but became vain in their
[1:41:14] imaginations
[1:41:16] and their and their foolish hearts was
[1:41:18] dark and so
[1:41:19] that it's not like they didn't have any
[1:41:21] imagination it just became vain it
[1:41:22] became empty
[1:41:25] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:41:26] became fools and changed the glory of
[1:41:29] the uncorruptable god into an image made
[1:41:32] like two corruptable men and to birds
[1:41:35] and four-footed beasts and creeping
[1:41:36] things wherefore god also gave them up
[1:41:38] to uncleanness through the lusts of
[1:41:40] their um through the lusts of their own
[1:41:43] hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[1:41:45] between themselves who change the truth
[1:41:47] of god into a lie and worship them serve
[1:41:49] the creature more than the creator who
[1:41:51] is blessed forever amen for this course
[1:41:54] god gave them up unto vile of
[1:41:56] affections for even their woman to
[1:41:58] change the natural use that uh into that
[1:42:01] which is against nature
[1:42:04] man i've got formatting
[1:42:05] funny and wait
[1:42:07] i print these things off but i
[1:42:10] um the top of my page is all formatted
[1:42:13] wrong so it's cut off half way hold on
[1:42:18] romans 1 and 26.
[1:42:23] and likewise also men leaving the
[1:42:24] natural use of women burned in their
[1:42:27] last one towards another men with men
[1:42:29] working that which is unseemly and
[1:42:31] receiving in themselves that recompense
[1:42:33] of their error which was met and even as
[1:42:36] they did not like to retain god in their
[1:42:38] knowledge they didn't want to re see
[1:42:39] they didn't want to become god conscious
[1:42:41] they did not want to be god conscious
[1:42:43] there used to be a time when society was
[1:42:45] god conscious that's why you read about
[1:42:48] the you know great revivals and
[1:42:50] evangelists back a hundred odd years ago
[1:42:52] they would preach and people just fall
[1:42:54] under conviction in the street why
[1:42:56] because there's a god consciousness in
[1:42:58] society they realized that there was a
[1:43:00] holy god and wrath was going to fall on
[1:43:02] them unless they received jesus christ
[1:43:04] and you know
[1:43:05] who's who's with those kind of
[1:43:07] right because people were god conscious
[1:43:09] they retained god and their knowledge
[1:43:11] but they've come to a point where man
[1:43:12] doesn't want to retain god in their
[1:43:14] knowledge
[1:43:15] sadly many people just think jesus
[1:43:16] christ is a curse word
[1:43:19] but it's the name above all names
[1:43:22] that's the name of the very lord of
[1:43:23] glory
[1:43:28] um god gave them over to a reprobate
[1:43:30] mind to do those things which are not
[1:43:32] convenient being filled with all
[1:43:34] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[1:43:36] covetousness maliciousness full of envy
[1:43:38] murder debate deceit malignancy
[1:43:41] whisperers backbiters haters of god
[1:43:43] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[1:43:46] evil things disobedient to parents
[1:43:49] without understanding covenant breakers
[1:43:51] without natural affection implacable
[1:43:53] unmerciable
[1:43:55] i mean unmerciful who knowing the
[1:43:57] judgment of god that they which commit
[1:43:59] such things are worthy of death not only
[1:44:01] do the same but have pleasure in them
[1:44:04] that do them
[1:44:06] so people can fall to such a state
[1:44:09] that they actually have pleasure
[1:44:10] when they see other people doing these
[1:44:12] things
[1:44:14] you know there was if i can find
[1:44:18] some people say now
[1:44:20] i've i'm sure we can agree the world is
[1:44:22] in this state
[1:44:24] this is why i say this world's a
[1:44:25] hurricane yeah
[1:44:27] because this doesn't there's no neutral
[1:44:29] ground or you could say there's no no
[1:44:31] man's land
[1:44:32] everything
[1:44:33] there's no void
[1:44:35] and these things will try and come in to
[1:44:37] us
[1:44:38] if we let them
[1:44:41] people say my body my choices
[1:44:43] it should actually be my body my
[1:44:45] responsibility and that goes for men and
[1:44:47] women
[1:44:48] right but but that's just the thing my
[1:44:50] body my choice i'll do what i know your
[1:44:52] body your responsibility because
[1:44:53] everyone will have to give an account
[1:44:54] before the judgment seat of god
[1:44:57] amen so
[1:45:00] you know there was this is a few years
[1:45:02] ago when when the game of thrones was
[1:45:04] trending i trust no one's seen an
[1:45:05] episode i have not for myself
[1:45:08] but there was outrage
[1:45:10] and this was in the news there was
[1:45:12] outrage because
[1:45:14] in a lot of well in some episodes i
[1:45:16] don't know how many there was rape and
[1:45:18] inci in incest
[1:45:21] not to mention the violence the adultery
[1:45:22] fornication and witchcraft going on and
[1:45:25] people were outraged by it but yet they
[1:45:27] watched it
[1:45:28] and the author said well that's what the
[1:45:29] characters like to do so it's fine
[1:45:33] and people just accepted that it's art
[1:45:36] is it
[1:45:37] what does that mean it's art
[1:45:39] but people just lapped it up what is
[1:45:41] that having pleasure people watching it
[1:45:43] having pleasure in them that do them
[1:45:46] see what is that
[1:45:47] that's that's darkness
[1:45:50] and now what happens is the devil raises
[1:45:52] the shock factor
[1:45:54] so what becomes acceptable comes a lot
[1:45:56] well really i can say he loves the shock
[1:45:57] factor makes things a lot more deprived
[1:46:00] and then so what's acceptable
[1:46:02] can be far more worse than what it was
[1:46:04] even just a few years ago
[1:46:07] what is that because people don't want
[1:46:08] to retain god in their knowledge
[1:46:11] they just want to do what they want to
[1:46:12] do so god gives them over to these
[1:46:14] things
[1:46:15] you don't want to be caught up in that
[1:46:17] kind of wind
[1:46:18] that kind of storm
[1:46:20] because those things creep in and affect
[1:46:23] everything else that people watch
[1:46:25] so we've got to be very careful
[1:46:27] what we allow to come into our spirit
[1:46:30] because this is where the storm comes in
[1:46:32] right the eyes the window to the soul
[1:46:36] now if you want to be destabilized
[1:46:38] then fill yourself up with these things
[1:46:41] if you want to be stabilized stay with
[1:46:42] the word
[1:46:43] who wants to live an overcoming life
[1:46:46] stay with the lord jesus
[1:46:49] now that may be an extreme example i
[1:46:51] said about game of thrones but it now
[1:46:53] affects everything that is out there
[1:46:56] yeah it's amazing you know our bodies
[1:46:58] this is back in 1958 the value
[1:47:01] of the chemicals in the bot that made up
[1:47:04] the body according to the profit was 84
[1:47:06] american cents you take all the calcium
[1:47:09] everything that's me
[1:47:10] you boil it all down
[1:47:12] the value of those elements is 84 cents
[1:47:15] back in 1958.
[1:47:17] something about two bucks or something i
[1:47:18] don't know now
[1:47:20] so but people will spend their whole
[1:47:22] life looking after these 84 cents
[1:47:25] everything they do they'll be very very
[1:47:26] careful but when it comes to their
[1:47:28] spirit
[1:47:30] or their soul which is eternal they will
[1:47:32] just pump anything into it they're not
[1:47:34] even worried you know brother brown
[1:47:36] would say you'll go to a restaurant
[1:47:39] and you would pick up a bowl of soup
[1:47:41] and it had a fly in it you'd turn it
[1:47:43] down that quick
[1:47:45] wouldn't you
[1:47:46] you go to a buffet i mean you get placed
[1:47:48] a meal in this and there's a dead fly in
[1:47:50] your whatever source do you think you're
[1:47:52] just going to eat that up and say well
[1:47:54] that's good protein no you look you'll
[1:47:55] complain you'll refuse to put that into
[1:47:58] your body
[1:48:00] right and he says here yes sir i would
[1:48:03] have nothing to do with that well i'll
[1:48:04] see if the paper knows it the chamber of
[1:48:06] commerce what about the president of the
[1:48:08] restaurant the owner
[1:48:09] see and then if i could bring up today
[1:48:11] uh bring it to today's language i'll put
[1:48:13] a google review on this restaurant i'll
[1:48:15] give it zero stars i want everyone to
[1:48:17] know there's flies in the soup
[1:48:20] bring it to today's language
[1:48:22] you see you watch that 84 cents
[1:48:25] you won't put nothing you won't put
[1:48:28] nothing poisonous in it
[1:48:30] but let the devil pack anything in that
[1:48:32] soul that he desires to and that soul's
[1:48:34] eternal that's right
[1:48:35] so we don't want to just put you know we
[1:48:37] care about this thing
[1:48:38] what about our soul
[1:48:40] we don't want to be caught up in the
[1:48:42] storm i say this hurricane of this age
[1:48:45] brother abraham says that this is a new
[1:48:47] erotic age i'm just going to finish with
[1:48:48] these comments
[1:48:50] mental mental illness is rife in this
[1:48:52] time
[1:48:53] and it doesn't matter how much the
[1:48:55] government pumps into it
[1:48:58] praise the lord for all they can do but
[1:48:59] we know they can only do so much because
[1:49:01] they psychologists never go into spirits
[1:49:03] and things like that
[1:49:05] right but this age is full of mental
[1:49:09] illness
[1:49:10] and brother abraham even says in the
[1:49:11] church book it doesn't seem to make
[1:49:13] sense i'm just paraphrasing very loosely
[1:49:15] it doesn't make sense that people are so
[1:49:17] depressed on so many prescription drugs
[1:49:19] to keep their mood balanced because we
[1:49:21] have everything
[1:49:23] we have we we man we you know some of
[1:49:27] the food that we just have for dinner
[1:49:29] the emperors
[1:49:30] julius caesar didn't eat this good
[1:49:34] the great kings or whoever you know
[1:49:36] cleopatra didn't eat this good oh oh
[1:49:38] whoever you know genghis khan or what's
[1:49:40] you know some great emperor they don't
[1:49:42] eat half as good as what we do
[1:49:46] amen we we better than the emperors
[1:49:48] every day
[1:49:51] we got way better yeah everything we
[1:49:52] have is far better than whatever they
[1:49:55] had
[1:49:56] but yet for some reason
[1:49:58] mental illness is gripping the hat well
[1:50:00] has gripped
[1:50:01] the world
[1:50:03] and he calls it a neurotic age now
[1:50:06] neurotic means now i can't remember what
[1:50:08] website i got this from sorry says
[1:50:10] neurotic means you're you're afflicted
[1:50:12] by new uh neurosis a word that's been
[1:50:15] used since the 1700s to describe mental
[1:50:18] emotional or physical reactions that are
[1:50:21] drastic and irrational
[1:50:24] at its root a neurotic behavior is an
[1:50:27] automatic unconscious effort to manage
[1:50:29] deep anxiety
[1:50:32] we're not meant to have anxiety
[1:50:34] be anxious for nothing
[1:50:36] but this is the world we live in
[1:50:38] we're not called to have deep anxiety
[1:50:40] we're called to have deep peace
[1:50:42] remember remember the prophet stood and
[1:50:44] preached shalom peace god's peace be
[1:50:46] upon you
[1:50:47] and i just said god's peace be upon me
[1:50:50] that you became the me hallelujah
[1:50:53] amen says in 1980 an american
[1:50:56] psychiatric association or the american
[1:50:58] um psychiatric association removed the
[1:51:01] term uh neurosys from its
[1:51:04] diagnostic manual as a part of a revamp
[1:51:07] to stand desire to standardize the
[1:51:09] criteria for mental illness today
[1:51:12] neurosis is not a standalone mental
[1:51:14] condition i said doctors most often put
[1:51:16] it symptoms in the same category as
[1:51:18] anxiety disorder in other words what
[1:51:22] what used to be called neurosis falls
[1:51:24] under the umbrella of anxiety this world
[1:51:27] is anxious
[1:51:28] why because we're in a storm and they
[1:51:31] don't know what's causing the storm and
[1:51:32] they have no stabilizers but if we have
[1:51:34] stabilizers we can be in the storm you
[1:51:37] know those big container ships they go
[1:51:38] through hurricanes sometimes they just
[1:51:41] they just keep sailing
[1:51:43] hallelujah remember brother ram says
[1:51:45] what you see in the natural with the
[1:51:47] technological advancements it's just a
[1:51:49] reflection of what god is doing in the
[1:51:51] spiritual
[1:51:52] i mean so it used to be little boats
[1:51:54] could never get through hurricanes
[1:51:55] that's why there's shipwrecks everywhere
[1:51:57] but nowadays they just go through if
[1:51:58] they can
[1:51:59] and they see the storm coming afar off
[1:52:01] by satellite navigation and they just
[1:52:03] bypass the whole thing
[1:52:06] what about in the spiritual
[1:52:08] i've got stabilizers how about you
[1:52:10] hallelujah
[1:52:12] amen that we don't need to have deep
[1:52:14] anxiety
[1:52:16] but we can have a deep peace
[1:52:19] hallelujah
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:23] now
[1:52:25] i'm just going to finish with this
[1:52:26] because i feel that
[1:52:28] we're out of time now this deep peace we
[1:52:31] have now if you don't have it you can
[1:52:33] get it we don't have to put up with the
[1:52:35] storm
[1:52:36] right it may be blowing out there but
[1:52:37] not in here
[1:52:38] it may be a storm in there but not in me
[1:52:41] right we don't have to live with it now
[1:52:44] you think about the prophecies
[1:52:46] where it becomes personal
[1:52:48] where the apostle paul would say they
[1:52:51] which are alive and remain
[1:52:53] shall not prevent them which is you know
[1:52:56] a sleep of dead in christ shall rise
[1:52:57] first he says but that we which are
[1:52:59] alive and remains of the coming of lord
[1:53:01] shall not prevent them which are sleeps
[1:53:02] think about the rapture cycle i trust
[1:53:04] that we have become me
[1:53:06] amen where the lord has revealed that
[1:53:08] scripture because why you're a
[1:53:09] predestinated
[1:53:10] vessel at a predestined time when
[1:53:13] there's a fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:53:15] hallelujah just like meredith anchors
[1:53:16] into your soul i'm part of that number
[1:53:19] hallelujah in 2nd corinthians 5 and 1
[1:53:21] for we know that if our earthly house of
[1:53:23] this tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:53:25] building of god a house not made with
[1:53:27] hands eternal in the heavens i trust
[1:53:29] that we becomes me for i know
[1:53:32] if this earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:53:34] were dissolved i have a building
[1:53:36] of god a house not made with hands
[1:53:38] eternal in the heavens hallelujah you
[1:53:41] know
[1:53:42] the prophet tells us an enticing spirits
[1:53:44] give me a preacher give me a christian
[1:53:46] give me a housewife that's a christian
[1:53:48] give me a farmer or a factory worker
[1:53:51] that will put god first and everything
[1:53:53] i'll show you a man that will be
[1:53:54] successful in spite of all the devil can
[1:53:57] put on him
[1:53:58] amen he seeks god first
[1:54:01] hallelujah it doesn't matter what
[1:54:02] storm's blowing
[1:54:04] that person will be successful
[1:54:06] amen because they put god first
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:09] hallelujah
[1:54:11] the apostle paul would say this
[1:54:13] he says in romans 8 more over whom he
[1:54:15] did predestinate them he also called and
[1:54:18] whom he called them he also justified
[1:54:20] and whom he justified them he also
[1:54:22] glorified i trust this is personal to
[1:54:24] you
[1:54:25] amen what shall we say to these things
[1:54:28] have god before us who can be against us
[1:54:30] so the storm can be the biggest in
[1:54:32] history but if god is for me
[1:54:34] what can be against me
[1:54:36] hallelujah he that spared not his own
[1:54:38] son but delivered up for us all how
[1:54:41] shall um how shall he not with him also
[1:54:43] freely give us all things who shall they
[1:54:45] charge who shall lay anything to the
[1:54:47] charge of god's elect it's god that
[1:54:49] justifieth who is he that condemneth it
[1:54:52] is christ that died ye rather that has
[1:54:53] risen again who is even at the right
[1:54:55] hand of god who maketh intercession for
[1:54:58] us
[1:54:59] hallelujah i trust those kind of
[1:55:01] scriptures to become personal it's not
[1:55:04] to someone else but if god is for me who
[1:55:06] can be against me
[1:55:08] hallelujah
[1:55:09] whom he called i've been called
[1:55:12] he's also justified i've been justified
[1:55:15] whom he justified he is also glorified
[1:55:18] hallelujah
[1:55:20] brother abraham says that
[1:55:22] that
[1:55:23] god wants to manifest his revelation in
[1:55:27] you and i
[1:55:28] where it's actually a personal walk
[1:55:30] between you and god upon this rock the
[1:55:33] revelation of who he is i'll build my
[1:55:34] church
[1:55:35] and brother braham would say that all
[1:55:37] hell not against so so this is not to a
[1:55:40] see he says it goes right by then i'm
[1:55:42] just going to finish with this quote i
[1:55:43] promise i'm not going to about to close
[1:55:45] i will it goes right by them they don't
[1:55:47] recognize till it's gone speaking about
[1:55:49] when truth comes and then it moves on
[1:55:51] then then people begin to glorify what's
[1:55:53] happened in the past it only picks up
[1:55:55] the predecessor that god predestined
[1:55:57] before the foundation of the earth the
[1:55:59] same thing came through in the days of
[1:56:00] noah the same thing came through in the
[1:56:02] days of moses days of elijah days of the
[1:56:04] prophets days of jesus down through to
[1:56:07] this very hour the pregnant person with
[1:56:09] the seed of god
[1:56:10] uh the word in there manifesting itself
[1:56:13] so surrendered to the will of god that
[1:56:15] the word and the word alone manifests
[1:56:17] itself in this person the prisoner to an
[1:56:20] individual
[1:56:21] not say my church my church has nothing
[1:56:23] to do with it it's an individual one
[1:56:25] person
[1:56:26] and
[1:56:27] and the prophet says all hell is against
[1:56:29] this teaching all hell is against this
[1:56:31] truth but it is the truth it means it's
[1:56:34] when god reveals himself manifests
[1:56:36] himself in you
[1:56:38] jesus never said now peter you and john
[1:56:40] all the rest of the people you've got
[1:56:41] the revelation now the whole church is
[1:56:42] saved no it is to him personally i say
[1:56:45] unto thee not to them to thee thou art
[1:56:48] peter upon this rock i'll build my
[1:56:50] church and the word peter means stone
[1:56:52] stone means confess one or the separated
[1:56:54] one upon a certain stone upon a certain
[1:56:57] thing see i called out the church called
[1:57:00] out upon the stone upon this revelation
[1:57:02] flesh and blood never revealed it to you
[1:57:04] but upon this revelation called out
[1:57:06] group i'll build my church in them and
[1:57:09] or and all the gates of hell will never
[1:57:11] be able to withstand it not one hair of
[1:57:14] your head shall perish your mind i'll
[1:57:16] raise you up on the last day give unto
[1:57:18] him eternal life raise him up at the
[1:57:20] last days there it is the revelation not
[1:57:22] them but him an individual not a group
[1:57:24] an individual all hell is against it but
[1:57:27] his mystery is only revealed to his
[1:57:29] beloved bride that's the only one who
[1:57:31] can see it
[1:57:32] hallelujah
[1:57:34] amen so it's got to be i just trust at
[1:57:36] the end of this well say is the lord
[1:57:38] personal to you
