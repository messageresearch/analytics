to what true to your word amen thank you musicians thank you amen god bless you everyone amen amen trust everyone's had a good week thus far i mean we're in the battle but we know who wins hallelujah so let's go to the book of um psalms we're just gonna just a quick thought here if we could say it that way before we uh go into prayer together i mean i want to just um say god bless you all tonight um we're going to go to psalm 34 and then we're going to go to psalms um 107 so i don't have a powerpoint so maybe our friend joshua is quick on the trigger psalm 34 and verse 1. i'm going to read here amen psalm 34 and 1. i mean who feels good today don't worry if you feel bad don't worry about it just just just cast it to one side we're here to worship god in spirit and in truth don't worry about how you feel we're here to praise god hallelujah so you know we have blessed people when coming to his presence not just come to a church but come into his presence and he can change us and mould us and it's good to see oh my robin here god bless you praise the lord god bless you amen amen god bless you amen we're with you amen we're with you amen psalm 34 and 1. i will bless the lord at all times i like that don't you i'll bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth and notice that it doesn't say in the good times or the bad times just at all times amen my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears amen they looked upon him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed i mean this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the lord encampeth about a round about them that fear him and delivereth them i like that he doesn't just camp about us but he delivers amen oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him hallelujah now we're just going to go up over to psalm 107 and um we're going to read verses 1 down to verse 8 here and we're going to go to book of deuteronomy chapter 4. amen psalm 107 and verse 1 i give thanks unto the lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the lord say so amen amen his mercy endureth forever hallelujah because we can say it because we're the redeemed of the lord amen whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy amen we're taking out the clutches of satan we're free people tonight i mean and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way we're just in a bubble to ourselves going around about and in a wilderness they found no city to dwell in couldn't find a place where we fit in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of all their distresses hallelujah and he led them forth by the right way that i might go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfied the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness who can testify to that verse hallelujah amen such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron because they rebelled against the words of the lord and condemned the council of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labor they fell down and there was none to help then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses he brought them out of the darkness in the shadow of death and break their bands in sunder oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men hallelujah now we're gonna we could just keep reading but you know we've got to find a place to get off somewhere and we're going to go to deuteronomy chapter 4 and we're going to read verses 7 and 8. deuteronomy 4 and verses 7 and 8. amen um yeah it's good to be a believer isn't it amen pretty good amen yeah i think i i can't remember who said it originally i think maybe brother blue kennedy did but you know um christine's granddad brother kevin says all this in heaven too you know so you know we get all this and heaven too so it's pretty good down here it's gonna be way better up there but yeah all this in heaven too sometimes we just need to look at what really the main thing is you know there's many things we look at with our five senses and there's trouble and the world's just like a drunken man's teetering along and craziness but you know we have a sure word of prophecy holy you know we know where we're going we know where we came from and no and we know who we are amen and we know where our god is that's the main thing amen deuteronomy 4 chapter 4 verses 7 and 8. for what nation this is this is moses and his part of his last address to the children of israel before the lord takes him home for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them now to me the reason they're such a great people is because god is so nice so close unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for and what nation is there so great that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i have set before you this day amen let's bow heads in a word of prayer gracious lord jesus lord our hearts desires you would change our hearts lord to be like yours lord jesus give us a heart like thine lord we thank you because of the cross of calvary we can ask for that lord and we can receive it lord jesus lord because lord you've come to make us new creatures and you all old things are passed away and all things have become new o god and thank you lord we can come into your presence this evening and just let off the pressure lord we're so thankful you are our source of strength lord our source of stability our source of comfort lord and help lord in this time of trouble i just pray dear god may just move us into a channel of prayer lord as a body lord of lord a a group of redeemed ransomed lord blood washed blood bought sons and daughters of god lord we love you with all our hearts tonight we just pray you'd meet every need for your glory lord jesus touch each one here lord not just here but also those who may be streaming in lord may be their portion wherever they are lord grant it their god in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats uh tonight but if i could just have a you know give a bit of a thought tonight i just want to talk about you know how great is our god how great is his word you know brother bram you know a a a woman would would come to him and he would he would uh you know bring this up from time to time where where you know she would say you know brother brown there's one thing i hold against you you know you preach pretty well but there's one thing and and then brother and thought well obviously i found grace in your sight and then he then she said you know the problem i have with you with you is you brag on jesus too much and there's a brother abraham said well i hope that's what the the only thing that the lord holds against me i mean because we know that the lord you know jesus christ is god himself so she would say that's the problem you bet you brag on jesus too much and i think in reality we can never brag on our lord too much amen he's so great he's so wonderful amen he's so merciful he's full of grace amen he's full of love he's full of judgment he's full of peace he's full of all things hallelujah i mean all things that are good amen and and we should just rejoice amen in our lord israel as we read there in deuteronomy 4 for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god and all things that we call upon him for now if you just think about where they were standing in that day you know god was god was with them but god could never be in them you know even when god was about to come down on mount sinai and give the word to moses you know god instructed moses tell the people set a boundary around the base of the mountain no one's allowed on the mountain not even their animals if they do they're going to be killed so when god would came down on the mountain there was actually a gap a separation amen between the people and god but yet moses is saying how great is this people that god is so nigh unto them now we know that that back in the old testament it was death i mean to to to go into the prince of the pillar of fire unless you've been invited but now we know it's death not to go in i mean because beforehand under the blood of bulls and goats only a few people could go into that presence like the high priest once a year into the holy of holies and moses we know went up into the you know you know into the mountain but but under the blood of jesus christ i mean god is not just a distance now but god comes and dwells in his people where now we become the living dwelling place of the living god hallelujah so we could yo so i could actually say now how great is this because we know that we are we weren't a people but now we are a people i mean we weren't a nation but now we are a holy nation a royal priesthood as the scripture tells us so now we are the bride as a nation hallelujah we have the passport i mean we have our birth certificate proving that we are born again amen we're genuine sons and daughters of god hallelujah amen you know we you know we we we have a nation hallelujah we are a holy nation in this hour amen but you know it's incredible because even even you know if you look at what jesus would say about john the baptist he would say there is no greater prophet like him and he's talk and he's looking back through the old testament but he said the least in the kingdom of god is greater than john now why was that because john was the last prophet under the old dispensation of blood of bulls and goats it could only bring him to a certain level in christ right because the blood of bulls and gods could never bring a people to be joint heir with god himself but under the blood of jesus christ we're actually elevated above the old testament believer in our position in christ and we are now joint heirs with christ hallelujah i mean we are not you could say second-class citizens but we are joint ears with our king i mean and that's what he wants he doesn't want his bride way down somewhere he wants his bride lifted up to where he is hallelujah so even he would tell the disciples in john 14 he would say behold i go and prepare a place for you and if i go again wait let's just let's just read that shall we john john 14. let not your heart be troubled don't be troubled in this day don't let your heart be troubled that tells me you can let your heart be troubled but don't let it be troubled hallelujah amen you believe in god believe also on me in my father's house in many mansions if or not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am not where you are but where i am you shall be also and whether i go you know and the way you know so jesus is saying that i'm gonna go prepare a place for you i'm basically just rehashing what we just read i'm gonna go prepare a place for you and if i do i'll come again and receive you unto myself that where i am in that next dimension you know this message was a voice from another world you know this message wasn't a voice from kentucky it was a voice from another world brother ram would be standing there and he'd say i'm standing in two worlds right now he was staying there in front of the people but he said he was looking he was seeing visions as he was talking to people on the platform he says i'm standing in two worlds and he saw things that happened years ago amen and he saw things that were going to happen in the future where was he standing he was standing in another world so this message was actually a a voice from another world it was from glory i believe highly it wasn't from it wasn't from hell it wasn't from the reasons of the lost it was from glory i mean it was the lord jesus coming down to receive a people unto himself now we must be very very clear the reason that moses could say the people were so great is because god gathered them it wasn't them boasting look at me yeah i'm a son or daughter of abraham no no god made them great god called them out god justified them god set them free from slavery god washed them hallelujah god called them that was god's doing it wasn't their doing you know moses tried it himself he just killed one egyptian and that was that was his success pointed to one dead body in the sand ran away as a runaway prophet that was his success but when god got a hold of him hallelujah that same one just just shook that whole nation and brought out god's people he fulfilled the word for his life so you know the reason they were great is because god was among them god chose to be among them they didn't choose god to be among them god chose to be among them and it's the same thing with you and i god chose to come and dwell on you god choose to call you amen it wasn't you calling you seeking it was god amen they chose to call you hallelujah it was god that chose to turn your heart it was god that said i want to get that person's attention and i'm going gonna get their attention and what's god doing it wasn't you doing it was he doing you know brother brown would say oh people say i sought god i saw god no no no the pattern is always god seeks man man recognizes he's a sinner and he runs and he will run into the world or he'll become religious and try and justify his fallen nature by a whole bunch of scripture and that's the biggest barricade that needs to be bursted through because hey i came out of the world i knew i was lost and undone i didn't have a leg to stand on and the one leg i had to stand up i thought was i i never ended up in prison killed anyone shot anyone you know but then god came along in a dream said no your righteousness is filthy rags boy you know so it's wonderful when you realize man i'm i'm toast without him because at least at least you've got a starting point right but then when you come to the other side of that when you surrender your whole life to him amen and you give your whole being to him and he changes you like only he can holy then you're standing on the other side you can say i'm as righteous as god is righteous i'm as holy as god as holy i'm as justified as god is justified why because the scripture says he became sin amen right he he became sin that i'd become the risers of god in christ hallelujah so i hope that's not too shocking but it's true if i'm under the blood i'm under the blood amen hallelujah amen amen so i i just want to ask you know when we really think about it is there any ever been a people since you could say the book of acts where god is so nice to them has there ever been a people where god is so close where we're not living looking at the promise of a restoration in the future but we're living in it you know people before azusa street they actually they actually saw in the scripture there'd come a time when the holy ghost would be pulled out again they actually said it was going to happen again what they read about in the book of acts was going to happen again hallelujah they actually would read about a restoration they would have a longing but they weren't they weren't living in the season of that full restoration now we know we've gone past azusa street because we now have the giver himself we've gone back to the book of acts pentecost but there was a hunger in people's hearts they wanted to see a restoration and we're living in that season god allotted this their portion of time then but god's allotted our portion of time now hallelujah so so has it ever been do we do we know what we have this day do we really recognize we're not just justified by faith like luthor still still smoking pipe drinking beer brought a whole bunch of catholicism with them under the you know you're in that sardis age have a name but you're dead because they had their own name of a church you know or even under the wesleyan movement do we you know do do you really do we really recognize what we have in him you know we have all things we don't just have a partial restoration you know when brother ram would stand there and preach it's the restoration of the bride tree hallelujah and then he would go to ezekiel's dry bones and you go about the four stages of restoration and he'd say about you know then finally because there comes that part in ezekiel's dry bones where the skin's on the flesh is on but they don't have any life for them but then but then ezekiel said prophesy son of man amen and that prophet began to prophesy they got up like a mighty army life came into them and he said oh if i just had time to go into ezekiel's drive bones we said prophesy son of man what had to happen there had to be malachi 4 upon the earth i mean that god could actually fulfill that scripture through a prophet on the earth that could release a word of life hallelujah upon a people we were not just a bunch of bones on the ground or even them come together or even just flesh on the body but now we're standing up waka's life has come in hallelujah and if you think about that scene could those dry bones say i'm going to come back to life again no no they're in the valley they're just sitting there and here we were in this world i don't know where you were but i was a place and it was dry no life in me desert hallelujah but when god looked down remember it's god's choosing you say well that's not fair to everyone else i'm just happy i'm in you know that's how i view it i'm just glad he called me and i just hope the honey will spread on some other people amen and they'll begin to lick and rejoice and taste and see the lord is good hallelujah so why are you happy how can i not be happy we live in a time of trouble the world's falling apart it has to fall apart it will get worse it must get worse it's prophesied to get worse but we have our ticket out of here i mean we have our ticket if you've got the holy ghost on the inside of the inside of you you're carrying your token holly you can't drop it you know who's ever been you know you can't fly overseas well you probably can now but it's pretty hard but who's ever sat in a departure lounge and you check where your ticket is you check where your passport is five minutes later you check where your ticket is you check where your passport is you go sit a bit closer to the gate you check your ticket you check you know i don't need to do that i can't lose it we're sealed into the day of our redemption i can't lose my ticket hallelujah amen so i was in a dry place but god saw this potential in those bones i didn't see any potential in me but god saw potential just like all of us i mean all the all the seed of god wherever they are hallelujah you may still be a bone on the ground but i'll say god sees potential in you i remember if you just cry out say god hallelujah i don't want to stay in this condition amen and we're just going to skip through that but you know we're standing up as a mighty army right now i once was dead but now i live i was once blind but now i see amen so do we know where we're standing where's god brought us we're not you know brother bram says that a bridegroom call will come right through this it's a call to a marriage and it's not just people to fill in at the reception this is not the lord saying well i've got so many seats seats of the wedding supper i need to fill and then go look at extended family third cousin twice removed the weird uncle bob that you wouldn't you know you know those friends from school you know that's not how it works it's all the same category of people it's all bright kind of people hallelujah it's not it's not even it's not even maids of honor and you know flower girls no no bride this message is a bridegroom call hallelujah all the same category of people is called hallelujah amen hallelujah that's why i ask you do you know where you're standing and yeah many times we look in the mirror and we say how can i ever make it because there's a war within and without we know right that's why when there's a body change hallelujah hallelujah you know we're going to be happy when this thing's changed but just because there's battles going on doesn't mean amen that that that we are not believers now hopefully i can find this scripture but i'm just gonna let's go to philippians we read it last night and i was like this is this is cool philippians 1 and 28. you know who's oh yeah yeah brother ahmad says it turn your frown upside down and give your face a rest it takes more muscles to frown than to smile so let's be happy and look it uses less energy you know the real lazy ones among us should be smiling anyway and nothing yes and nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god so don't be terrified by your adversaries i've got this mime battle i've got this sickness i've got this trouble don't be trouble can you can you just leave that up don't be terrified by them which is to them an evident token of perdition had the devils the devil's picked aside we picked the side too and him coming against us is just evidence where he's going and where he's from right but to you of salvation why because if the devil has someone he just has them and he leaves them alone he prospers them gives them a little kingdom can be very big can be very small depends what kind of price he puts on the gift in their life yep he'll give you well we've all been on the auction block right and the devil's bid and god has bid but the thing is we get to choose who we get sold to remember the higher the value of a soul the more the devil will try and give them right but the thing is there comes a point where actually if you just let the bidding war go higher and higher and higher the devil says i can't match that bit amen hallelujah he can't match the bit of the blood why because you've got to look at now what can i get what can i get from the devil can i receive eternal life can i receive peace for my soul can i receive forgiveness of sins so he has nothing to give me right he can't give me heaven amen he can't give me a rapture he can't give me overcoming power not that he want to give it because he wants us to be mashed down under his control but he has nothing to give me hallelujah but anyway which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god so don't be terrified of your adversaries hallelujah i think that i thought that was pretty cool you know are the enemies against me well that's actually a token of your salvation that's proof that actually you have something the devil wants but you're not giving it to him even because you've already given it to someone else which is the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen see as i said if the devil you know if he's got you he just leaves you alone really because you you know because you become coercive to what he wants but if you have something that he wants that you won't give him he's going to come against you because he knows the potential of the sons and daughters of god he saw adam in the garden said tree come here lion come here window here he saw the power of the sons of god in in in his dominion he saw moses come into egypt as a serpent bruiser and he saw him bring the children of israel out he saw joshua say sun stancil moonstand still how he saw that he saw rahab bring her family in he saw ruth coming hallelujah he saw joseph amen do what he did to the santa cruz yeah your prosperity yo in egypt he saw elijah shut the heavens he saw he saw the son of god conquer all things hallelujah he saw it and he reads the same bible you read in the and this bible tells me that we're to be like jesus as he overcome will overcome as he conquered we are more than conquerors to him that loved us so the devil sees the potential of the sons and daughters of god and that's why he fights you but if we could just recognize what god has made us because of who he is not because of who we are but because of who he is hallelujah remember this the whole plan of redemption is resting upon him amen hallelujah it's not resting upon you and i sure god uses man to work his program out but ultimately it's his program if you know if we turn the call down he's got someone else will do it i'm glad we didn't have a rejoicing amen just out of that you know but you know that's god's program as i said a few sundays ago putting that picture up at boaz by the gate ruth isn't there ruth's not in the picture it's him doing it hallelujah so has there ever been a people i don't i don't want to be too long and and i'll just finish with this but has there ever been a people where god is so close to them closer than your next breath hallelujah i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world hallelujah isn't it amazing that we can just come into his presence the prophets of old longed to even just look into what you actually have right now they longed for this day daniel asked god when's it going to happen he says you stay in your lot the book sealed to the time of the end and here we are receiving an open book the book that was sealed has now come open hallelujah and now there's a people upon the earth that are blood washed remember the blood puts us on speaking terms that's why i put that by the door there i trust you read that when you walk in says the blood puts us in that condition puts us on speaking terms with god and here we come we can bow our heads and we can talk to our lord and he hears our prayer and he answers our prayers and his time according to to the good pleasure of his will and do you know that someone who's just met the lord five seconds ago has more authority with god than an archangel that never fell hallelujah gabriel or michael i'm just dramatizing they can be talking to the lord about something but then when one of us can be a little child they bow their head begin to talk to the lord the lord says shh my daughter's talking to me my son's talking to me they're more you know and he puts all of his attention on us isn't that wonderful amen so i think we should just finish there he hears our prayers has there ever been a people upon the earth like we happen to be never the book wasn't opened in paul's day it's open today it wasn't open in john's day it's open today he saw it but he's told to seal it up it wasn't open in luther's day martin's day wesley's day azusa street day it's open today hallelujah and what's it to do it says the brother brahm says that the seals opening it reveals christ there's been parts of him that have been hidden up since the world began and he's revealed himself to you that makes me feel about this big my fingers are together by the way it makes me feel this big that the lord would put us here in this moment and he put us our lives upon the earth to shake the kingdom of hell one more time to torment the devil just before the great tribulation and to not taste death has he ever been a people like us many people have longed to see the rapture they'll see it they'll be the dead in christ but they've longed to be alive and remain and we've known a few of them but they've died in faith hallelujah but we'll see them again as young young people and they'll tell us it's on and before we even know it our bodies will be changed oh my it's gonna happen you look the pa you just look at the past maybe 10 years it's been a time of refreshing has come from the presence of the lord the spirit of law has been poured out in greater ways greater reality what's happening it's going home time but he put you under the spout of his anointing because he wanted to fill you to overflowing he want to open his word to you so we can't look at the devil tells us you're not it you'll never make it you'll never overcome look at all these things he ain't my god amen he ain't my god i don't care what he says about me he i don't care what he tries to make me feel about myself i don't care that's irrelevant i care what my husband has told me and my husband is not ashamed of me hallelujah he's not ashamed of us he wants us to talk to him so maybe let's talk to him shall we we can go into the prince of god hallelujah we can walk out of this place changed and renewed isn't he isn't he a wonderful god isn't he it wasn't
