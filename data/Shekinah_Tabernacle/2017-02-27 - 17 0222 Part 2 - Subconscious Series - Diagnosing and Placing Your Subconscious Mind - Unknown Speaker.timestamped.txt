[0:01] amen I trust tonight your eyes have been
[0:04] turned towards the Lord amen and you
[0:07] know as a Christian we believe that you
[0:11] know the Lord is maturing us to a
[0:13] place on him and our our focus is always
[0:16] on him and there's nothing that can
[0:18] steer us from him no circumstances that
[0:21] can take us out of his atmosphere amen

[0:27] a mature Christian as someone that can
[0:30] in an atmosphere of perfect love
[0:31] regardless of circumstances amen and
[0:35] this series will actually deal with a
[0:37] lot with why we get taken out of those
[0:39] circumstances and why the things that
[0:42] the devil can use against us to pull us
[0:44] out of the secret place because you see
[0:47] in Psalm 91 the Lord has actually spoken
[0:49] to us that uh promise that he that
[0:53] dwells in the secret place of the most
[0:55] high dwell is to abide to stay to remain

[3:58] a Reverb or something it's kind of a
[4:00] little bit
[4:03] funny
[4:06] amen so tonight we're going to just go
[4:08] straight to the
[4:10] scriptures it's a good opportunity here
[4:12] to
[4:14] just open our hearts and let the Lord
[4:17] speak and you know if he if he deals in
[4:20] anything in your life or speaks anything
[4:23] lay it down right where you're at lay it
[4:25] down don't hold on to it cuz the word of
[4:28] God is a light unto our feet a lamp unto
[4:30] our paths we're all on a path tonight
[4:32] and the word is going forth and it can
[4:35] and maybe it will shine some light on
[4:37] something personal I don't know I
[4:40] haven't planned it but the Lord plans it
[4:42] so you know we can just just um be a
[4:45] faithful mailman to the message that the
[4:48] Lord has for his
[4:50] bride well we'll turn to Ephesians 4
[4:54] verse
[4:58] 21-23
[5:00] if so be that you have heard him and
[5:02] have been taught by him as the truth is
[5:04] in Jesus that you put off concerning the
[5:06] former conversation the old man which is
[5:10] corrupt according to the deceitful
[5:12] lusts and be renewed in the spirit of
[5:17] your mind let's just pray one more time
[5:19] lord Jesus add your blessing to the
[5:21] reading of your word and father may this
[5:24] this Vision that you want for us be
[5:28] reality to us Lord may we receive that
[5:31] pearl of great price tonight and may it
[5:34] become so personal to us renovate our
[5:37] spirit of our mind Lord Jesus I commit
[5:41] the service to you Lord in Jesus name
[5:43] amen you may be
[5:46] seated you put off the old
[5:49] man and actually it goes further on in
[5:52] this Ephesians we putting on the new man
[5:56] so these things these these action
[6:00] there's there's Commandments there's
[6:02] application in our lives that the Lord's
[6:04] given to us now how do we do that you
[6:07] know and there's a balance between what
[6:09] God does for us and what his grace does
[6:11] and what his word does and the power
[6:13] that's behind the word that's going to
[6:15] come through every channel in our life
[6:17] and change things but there's an
[6:19] application that God has given us to
[6:21] make to make these things happen because
[6:24] what he wants here he wants to us to be
[6:26] renewed in the spirit of our mind not
[6:29] just the physical mind now the brain but
[6:30] he wants us to be renewed in the spirit
[6:33] of our mind he wants us to be renewed in
[6:35] our subconscious mind he wants our
[6:37] conscious our whole conscious mind and
[6:40] our subconscious mind to be renewed now
[6:42] that word
[6:44] renew for the renewed is it is to
[6:48] renovate to
[6:50] reform you see the spirit need you you
[6:54] you receive a new spirit you receive a
[6:57] new mind and now through the able to
[7:00] fellowship with God and walking with a
[7:03] new spirit and a and a new and a new
[7:05] mind the mind of Christ now he wants to
[7:09] work down deep in your subconscious to
[7:12] renovate the spirit of your mind he
[7:14] wants to to to to take out some of the
[7:16] old things and and and you know maybe a
[7:18] bit tired it's been it's been run down a
[7:21] little bit and things have happened in
[7:23] your life that have caused it to get a
[7:26] bit derilict and maybe you walk in and
[7:28] it's had a it's had some people in there
[7:32] renting it out that weren't very
[7:34] wholesome people or wholesome things
[7:38] going on inside there and not very good
[7:41] music going on inside there and not very
[7:46] good movies going on inside there
[7:48] sitcoms and whatever you you
[7:51] know that sort of stuff you could say
[7:53] some pisky teenagers in a flat you know
[7:56] after they've been in the flat and you
[7:58] own that that flat if you're the
[8:00] landlord and they move out you're going
[8:01] to have to do some
[8:02] renovating because things are going to
[8:04] be a bit there's going to be holes in
[8:06] the walls the the plaster might be
[8:08] falling off in places there's stains all
[8:11] over the carpet it's time to pull all
[8:13] that stuff out and renovate and make it
[8:16] nice again and restore it back to the
[8:18] way it
[8:19] was now that's exactly what God wants to
[8:22] do in your heart that's what God wants
[8:25] to do in your subconscious that's what
[8:27] God wants to do right down deep
[8:33] amen a good man out of the good Treasure
[8:36] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[8:38] is good and an evil man out of the evil
[8:41] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[8:43] that which is evil for of the abundance
[8:45] of the heart his mouth
[8:48] speaks and now down in that heart and
[8:51] this is what gets us into trouble
[8:53] sometimes is if the abundance of your
[8:56] heart which is something that can speak
[8:59] before you can even realize and you'll
[9:02] find yourself and none of us are exempt
[9:04] because we've all got subconscious that
[9:06] need work on and there's things going on
[9:09] inside there that we don't want there
[9:11] and they've been placed there by things
[9:14] that have been outside of our control
[9:16] actually one of the main things that's
[9:17] placed it there is the way we were
[9:19] brought up it's the way our parents
[9:21] brought us up no matter how good their
[9:22] intentions
[9:24] were it was a repeat of the way they
[9:27] were brought up and all the way back
[9:29] and it changes a little bit from parent
[9:31] to parent because they obviously pick up
[9:32] more things as they go along and you
[9:34] picked up more things as you walked
[9:36] along in your life and more things stuck
[9:38] inside there it's a sticky Nature has
[9:40] been spoke about on Sunday it's things
[9:42] stick in there and the way they stick in
[9:44] there is through practice it's through
[9:47] something that causes a big emotion in
[9:49] your life or a trauma in your life and
[9:51] it and and and and and the subconscious
[9:54] it sticks in there and it writes a
[9:56] little program and it will and it's the
[9:58] feelings you were going through at that
[10:00] very moment at that time and it stores
[10:02] them in there and it keeps them there
[10:05] and then when you then sometime down the
[10:08] track when when when when you're going
[10:10] through an experience and the same thing
[10:12] is repeated that same emotions well up
[10:15] it's a sticky nature and the thing is
[10:18] your parents had that sticky nature in
[10:20] them and their subconscious had also an
[10:23] abundance in their heart was was was was
[10:25] all sorts of things that maybe weren't
[10:27] quite good and they brought you up the
[10:29] best that they knew how but the habits
[10:31] and the way that they connected with
[10:33] each other and the way they connected
[10:34] with you and the the way they punish you
[10:37] the way they treated you the way that
[10:39] they spent time with you all those
[10:41] things you were taking note of that on a
[10:43] subconscious level you were actually
[10:45] taking note of all those things and that
[10:48] formed from a very young age in your
[10:50] life formed the very person that you
[10:52] would be and and and and then following
[10:55] from that after that phase of your life
[10:57] closes off because
[10:59] I know what's going on
[11:01] here okay after closes off when you turn
[11:05] about 7 to 8 years old and you start
[11:07] maturing and you start becoming a more
[11:09] of a person and and that that childish
[11:12] toddler phase closes off what
[11:15] happens is your subconscious becomes
[11:18] less sticky but there are still things
[11:21] that are going to stick to you but
[11:22] they're not going to stick to you like
[11:23] they did when you were a child because
[11:26] God's created you in such a way that
[11:28] from the age of 0 to 6 give or
[11:32] take you were a recorder of every
[11:37] human interaction and everything because
[11:40] your subconscious was actually drawing
[11:42] it all in to learn how to be a human to
[11:44] learn how to react to learn how to act
[11:47] so you can imagine an UNH wholesome
[11:49] house that's like completely bad what
[11:52] those children you wonder why their
[11:54] children are so bad out there and it
[11:56] gets worse and worse and worse and worse
[11:58] and until God can get a hold of a
[12:01] generation and bring a generation under
[12:03] a better influence and then the parents
[12:06] correct a little bit but the problem is
[12:09] when Satan has reign in his own Eden and
[12:11] these generation after generation of
[12:12] poor parenting the people the way they
[12:15] are and now unfortunately as we become
[12:18] Christians we have come out of that and
[12:21] and maybe our parents were the ones that
[12:22] became the Christians and they came out
[12:24] of that but traits of that was the way
[12:27] you were brought up and and therefore in
[12:29] your heart is things that make you do
[12:31] things that you get in trouble for or
[12:33] say things that you don't want to say
[12:35] because out of the abundance of the
[12:37] heart the mouth speaketh and so when you
[12:39] first become a Christian little did we
[12:43] understand or know and we'll get this
[12:44] we're going to go right into this
[12:46] tonight that yes God came in when you
[12:50] got born again God came in but just a
[12:52] little white button size and still
[12:55] there's an abundance of things in there
[12:56] that need to be dealt with there's an
[12:58] abundance of and things in there that as
[13:00] soon as one little thing triggers spews
[13:03] out of your mouth and you don't even
[13:05] recognize and you're like man and you
[13:08] you and your Consciousness oh I better
[13:09] go along with this other I'm going to
[13:10] look real stupid and you do you kind of
[13:13] bat yourself up and then you get
[13:15] yourself further in a hole or you end up
[13:17] in China or whatever you know and we all
[13:20] know about
[13:21] that some of us have got different
[13:23] different temperaments as well so and it
[13:25] depends it's it's all we're all a mixed
[13:27] bag we're a complete mixed bag and so
[13:30] you cannot generalize well we can
[13:32] generalize but we cannot make everyone
[13:34] the same cuz we're all different we've
[13:36] all got different levels of different
[13:37] things but the main thing that we all
[13:39] have is a subconscious and and and out
[13:42] of the abundance of that the mouth will
[13:45] speak and it is a lot faster than your
[13:47] conscious mind a lot faster and it's
[13:50] going to react faster actually when you
[13:52] pick up a newspaper you pick up a
[13:54] newspaper this how fast your
[13:55] subconscious mind is the whole page
[13:57] every little word whatever type six font
[13:59] or whatever it may be your subconscious
[14:01] has read that the moment the light of
[14:03] that Paper Strikes your eyes the whole
[14:05] page everything all the information all
[14:07] the the ideologies everything your
[14:09] subconscious mind knew the whole thing
[14:11] comprehended everything and you didn't
[14:13] even see it
[14:15] but because your subconscious mind did
[14:18] that in a split second that's how fast
[14:20] it is how powerful it is because it did
[14:22] that it might something might have
[14:24] jumped out at you and you're like where
[14:25] was that I saw that word down there it
[14:28] popped into your mind into your mind's
[14:29] eye didn't you didn't physically see it
[14:31] your subconscious saw it and you look
[14:33] through the page oh there and then
[14:35] you're like oh true that's a good story
[14:37] because your subconscious said yes that
[14:38] I can relate to that that's something to
[14:40] do with my life I'm interested in that
[14:43] that's how fast it is but now because
[14:46] that's fast it reacts faster than you
[14:49] and another thing that it does as well
[14:51] to show you what I mean is when there's
[14:54] debris coming at you your eyes 80 90% of
[14:58] of the time close before the debris goes
[15:01] in your eyes because your subconscious
[15:03] mind actually sees it faster a third of
[15:06] a second faster than your conscious mind
[15:08] it's just faster it it functions in a
[15:11] higher um speed so much higher like um
[15:16] you know if anything if you know about
[15:18] computers and I think I mentioned it
[15:19] last week the conscious mind is about 40
[15:22] bits per second of data but the
[15:25] subconscious mind is about 40
[15:26] million so it's a super computer like
[15:30] Beyond any supercomputer that man can
[15:31] even dream of making that controls all
[15:34] your bodily functions that controls all
[15:37] the mitosis of all your cells and
[15:39] everything all all going on inside it's
[15:42] doing all of that and it's also
[15:43] processing everything around you and
[15:45] it's creating a three-dimensional image
[15:48] and all the sounds that's processing it
[15:49] all so that you can experience life
[15:52] that's what it's doing and at the same
[15:54] now now why I'm going through the what
[15:56] inspired me to go through the series is
[16:00] and I I don't want to get ahead of
[16:01] myself it was that this is the thing
[16:04] that brother brandom identified that's
[16:06] our biggest
[16:07] enemy not our soul our soul is perfect
[16:11] our soul is sealed if we're sealed our
[16:14] soul is in Dominion but now it's going
[16:17] to have a a hard time being in Dominion
[16:19] if the subconscious is
[16:21] so down and is so tormented by things
[16:25] that haven't been dealt with but I can
[16:27] tell you now
[16:29] God is ready to take over and
[16:32] God God's going to deal with you he's
[16:34] going to deal with that subconscious
[16:36] going to heal everything the light
[16:37] that's shining right now is going to
[16:39] shine and it's going to shine all those
[16:41] things and no stone will be left untuned
[16:44] let me continue
[16:48] on eat thou not the bread of him that
[16:50] has an evil eye neither desire thou his
[16:52] dainty Meats for as he thinks in his
[16:54] heart so is
[16:56] he eat and drink drink saith he to thee
[16:59] but his heart is not with thee so you
[17:02] see here we talk the the the vision to
[17:06] renovate that heart and to bring you
[17:08] into alignment so that God in your
[17:13] life his influence can come down and it
[17:16] can influence your soul and your soul
[17:18] can actually now take the reins and
[17:21] steer you without going in other
[17:24] directions and all this over the place
[17:26] when something comes in front of you you
[17:27] speaking it
[17:30] bringing you to perfect
[17:32] Faith you have to come to perfect Faith
[17:36] have to and you will it's an inevitable
[17:39] thing that's happening how is that going
[17:41] to
[17:41] [Music]
[17:43] happen by the ministry and of an
[17:45] entrance into the kingdom of God it'll
[17:48] come through the ministry and you will
[17:50] take that word and then you will eat
[17:53] that word and it will become part of
[17:55] your life and you'll apply those things
[17:58] and you will into you'll move into this
[18:02] you will move into perfect Faith by the
[18:04] grace of God and it's not the minister
[18:07] it's the ministry when I say that it's
[18:09] not any man it's God but he takes a gift
[18:12] and when I say Ministry I don't just
[18:14] mean behind the pulpit too because there
[18:16] is a Ministry in every life and each
[18:19] Ministry is going to work together to to
[18:21] to bring that entrance to bring the
[18:22] people above where they're at to lead
[18:25] you to the rock that is higher than you
[18:28] right now
[18:29] next Rock next Rock speak to that rock
[18:32] he's listening he's waiting amen
[18:37] Allelujah as a man thinks in his heart
[18:40] so is he it's the essence of your
[18:43] being session one we're going to deal
[18:46] with diagnosing and placing our
[18:48] subconscious
[18:52] mind Proverbs 4:23 to 27 keep thy heart
[18:56] with all diligence for out of it are the
[18:58] is issues of life out of your heart are
[19:01] the issues of life it's it's where
[19:03] everything comes forth and out of the
[19:06] abundance of that what's coming
[19:08] forth or what's going on inside there
[19:12] are you wanting to go a certain
[19:14] direction and that's taking you another
[19:15] direction are you sitting in a room and
[19:17] you're feeling
[19:19] uneasy and and yet you know you're saved
[19:22] you know that Christ has become
[19:25] king You' you Something's Happened to
[19:27] you but yet there's a turmoil going on
[19:31] or there's something happening that that
[19:33] that frustrates
[19:35] you out of it are the issues of life out
[19:38] of that
[19:40] heart put away from you a frowed mouth
[19:44] and perverse lips put far from you let
[19:49] your eyes look right on and let thine
[19:52] eyelids look straight before thee Ponder
[19:56] the path of your feet let all all your
[19:58] ways be established turn not to the
[20:01] right hand or to the left remove your
[20:03] foot from Evil now these are very simple
[20:06] things in this may be Elementary as Ben
[20:08] says you know it may be very
[20:11] Elementary but just Ponder your path of
[20:13] your feet consider what you're where
[20:17] you in your conscious mind are you
[20:21] allowing God to lead you or are you
[20:24] being led by your flesh or are you being
[20:26] led by your subconscious
[20:29] if you're being led by your subconscious
[20:30] you're in big trouble big trouble if
[20:32] you're being led by your emotions you're
[20:34] in big
[20:36] trouble do not be led by those
[20:40] things that's a feminine Spirit leading
[20:43] you that's a female Spirit leading
[20:48] you it's important to know who's leading
[20:52] you it's important to to to to be very
[20:56] serious about this walk
[20:59] what's going in these eyes of
[21:01] yours is it all the word of
[21:04] God or is there liven going in there is
[21:08] there liven in your homes is there
[21:10] things in your life that are going to
[21:12] continue to hold you down in
[21:16] prison what he's saying here Solomon
[21:19] he's giving instruction a very clear
[21:22] instruction he's saying now look your
[21:24] heart is made a certain way and if
[21:28] continue to allow things into your life
[21:30] and turn this way and be be wishy-washy
[21:32] and be and be tossed this way and tossed
[21:34] that way and all your affections are
[21:36] just mixed up with all this and that and
[21:39] then some of God and then some of this
[21:41] and then some dark movie here and what
[21:43] is going in your eyes what light is
[21:46] going in there how dark is that
[21:48] light that's very
[21:50] serious it's very serious because what
[21:53] goes in must come
[21:55] out and Satan will find any little legal
[21:59] ground to take to stay in your life
[22:02] anything anything doesn't matter he'll
[22:05] find it and if you're if you consent to
[22:07] anything that is not the word of God if
[22:10] that if Satan can use that in any way he
[22:13] will put you back into
[22:15] hell on Earth he can't take your soul
[22:19] but he will make your life a living
[22:21] misery and you'll never have you'll
[22:22] never have success as a Christian you'll
[22:26] just mope around and you'll have highs
[22:28] and lows and you might go to a
[22:30] convention and be all happy and then you
[22:32] leave that convention and because those
[22:34] things you're you're turning to the left
[22:37] here and dabbling here and your
[22:39] affections are all
[22:41] mixed you're going to have problems in
[22:42] your heart and out of your heart those
[22:44] issues of life you going have
[22:48] issues but you see now the light of God
[22:50] is shining on those issues the light of
[22:52] God is shining and bringing conviction
[22:54] and that
[22:55] conviction when it comes don't hold on
[22:59] to those things just let them go
[23:02] seriously because you see when this
[23:05] heart Gets In Tune and in harmony with
[23:07] your soul and with and with in alignment
[23:10] with who you are with who God is and you
[23:13] become a clear conduit of his love a
[23:16] clear conduit of his light you contain
[23:19] God in your affections what you love and
[23:21] what you like what makes you happy what
[23:24] what you what you enjoy is sit on things
[23:27] above
[23:28] because we're leaving this Earth why
[23:30] hold to any uh what are those ball and
[23:34] chain that would keep you on the
[23:37] earth
[23:40] my for out of it are the issues of
[23:43] Life remove your foot from Evil because
[23:48] if you don't remove your foot from Evil
[23:50] how are you going to stand on the
[23:52] serpent if the serpent you're in it and
[23:55] you're doing the things that he's made
[23:59] you know it's not going to be long
[24:00] before we're completely ostracized from
[24:02] the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[24:04] you might as well take your hands off
[24:05] his entertainment
[24:10] now who keeps your heart I just asked
[24:14] that question I won't answer
[24:17] enough now brother brandham he mentions
[24:20] here now it's choosing thoughts to roost
[24:24] and this is quite a cool little um
[24:27] analogy so he says now it's a strange
[24:29] thing that this is so much thought of
[24:30] people they say well I'm weak my faith
[24:33] is not very much I'm not a very good
[24:36] Christian that's just what the devil
[24:39] wants you to
[24:40] say you're just talking his language
[24:43] right
[24:44] then never never ever say that and and
[24:50] and really never think that because
[24:54] you're just if you're not when you say
[24:56] it you're letting the de devil know
[24:58] where you're at he doesn't know he
[25:00] doesn't know where you're at he'll just
[25:01] fire all the stuff at you and make you
[25:03] feel down and all the stuff you just
[25:05] speak positively because he doesn't know
[25:06] that it's affecting you it may be you
[25:08] might be feeling low down rotten as
[25:10] anything but never ever voice
[25:15] that you're you're you're you're you're
[25:17] you're you're taking away your
[25:20] testimony you're speaking his language
[25:23] now the next step is to stop thinking
[25:25] that because you might not testify it
[25:28] out but there's an internal testimony
[25:32] and the more you think those thoughts
[25:34] about yourself the more you speak down
[25:36] about yourself there's somebody
[25:38] downstairs there called the subconscious
[25:41] that eventually goes right that is me
[25:44] and you you just get yourself sunken
[25:45] down lower and lower and lower and lower
[25:48] because you are preaching to yourself
[25:50] when you share a testimony it's mainly
[25:53] for
[25:54] you it's not it's only a little bit for
[25:56] the others
[25:58] and some for the devil but it's mainly
[26:00] for you because that's a power of your
[26:03] testimony you're testifying what the
[26:05] word says about you and what God is
[26:07] doing in your life and what that is
[26:10] doing is something down here which
[26:12] learns by repetition and practice the
[26:15] old subconscious learns by repetition
[26:18] and
[26:19] practice as you share those testimonies
[26:21] over and over and as your thoughts
[26:23] become positive down here starts to
[26:26] become positive it doesn't happen
[26:28] overnight it doesn't happen in one
[26:29] session it doesn't happen in one church
[26:31] service though God can bypass all those
[26:34] things and change something when he
[26:36] really sees that you need that because
[26:39] you're in such a place you can't get out
[26:41] he'll do it but in the
[26:43] general he wants you he's written in his
[26:46] Bible the whole practice of a Christian
[26:49] the out working life of a Christian is a
[26:53] positive Christian is positivity it's
[26:56] never letting corrupt things things come
[26:57] out of your mouth about others and
[26:59] especially about yourself because the
[27:01] more corrupt things you say and think
[27:03] about yourself you start to believe that
[27:06] and it's a lie an absolute lie of the
[27:09] devil and it's speaking his language and
[27:11] you might as well be swearing and
[27:13] cursing because that's exactly what it
[27:15] is you're cursing yourself and the
[27:18] subconscious has got no logical thinking
[27:20] it doesn't figure out stuff it just
[27:22] listens to what you say it listens to
[27:25] the thoughts that go down down and all
[27:28] time change that way of
[27:32] thinking that's a complete next part of
[27:35] the series but it's good to put that
[27:37] there because it's so important so
[27:39] important when the Lord show me those
[27:41] things I was
[27:44] amazed that's just what the devil wants
[27:46] you to say you're just talking the
[27:48] devil's language right n see you mustn't
[27:51] never say that don't ever let your
[27:53] testimony be negative let it be positive
[27:56] all the time
[27:58] now that doesn't mean okay now we want
[28:00] to balance this that doesn't mean that
[28:02] if you're sick you pretend you're not
[28:04] sick and say no I'm not sick I don't
[28:08] have this you do it's a it's a fact that
[28:11] whatever you've got you've got but your
[28:13] testimony isn't that your testimony is I
[28:16] may be this but God has done this for me
[28:18] in God's word he's healed Me by his
[28:21] stripes I am healed and maybe you're
[28:25] feeling down and someone ask you how you
[28:28] feeling and they're close to you and say
[28:29] I'm not feeling very well but God is my
[28:31] joy and his strength his Joy is my
[28:34] strength and I'm going to praise Him
[28:37] amen that's your
[28:39] testimony you don't have to lie and
[28:42] pretend that you're not something if you
[28:44] are that David didn't lie man you should
[28:46] see the start of a many of a some oh I'm
[28:49] so broken and I'm crushed down like a
[28:51] rose all those things but he doesn't
[28:55] stop there he doesn't leave it in the
[28:57] negative
[28:58] he says but God rich in Mercy amen he's
[29:02] my buckler my shield my strong and
[29:05] mighty tower he he rescues me he makes a
[29:08] a table in the presence of my enemies
[29:13] always be clear on what your testimony
[29:16] is hallelujah it's a positive
[29:20] life I am saved I have God in my heart I
[29:24] believe him with all my heart do you
[29:26] believe in divine healing with all my
[29:28] heart let your testimony always and your
[29:33] thoughts everything never permit a
[29:36] negative thought to come in your mind if
[29:38] you can help
[29:41] it sometimes the Lord can allow a great
[29:44] trial to come and don't beat yourself up
[29:47] if you find yourself in a great trial
[29:49] there's something happening God has
[29:51] allowed
[29:52] that there's something going on it needs
[29:55] to be there may be something hiding down
[29:57] deep
[29:58] and it might take a big Valley in your
[30:00] life to to find it might be buried down
[30:04] right down down down and some of those
[30:06] things it takes some pain it takes some
[30:09] failure to crush some pride or to root
[30:13] out something that's causing you to want
[30:14] to watch those things or listen to those
[30:17] things or practice those
[30:21] things or not practice you know
[30:25] restrictions so never in a negative
[30:28] thought to come in your mind if you can
[30:29] help it when it starts that don't
[30:31] entertain it well you say I can't help
[30:33] the thoughts from coming well that will
[30:36] be like the farmer that said he couldn't
[30:38] stop the birds from flying over his
[30:40] place but he could sure stop them from
[30:43] roosting so that's a good thing you see
[30:46] you can't help the thoughts when they
[30:48] come but don't entertain them just pass
[30:51] it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior
[30:55] All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going
[30:58] to keep
[31:00] them I'm going to testify of them and
[31:04] God can only bless you as you confess
[31:07] that he has done it for
[31:09] you that's powerful God can only bless
[31:13] you as you
[31:15] confess as it comes out of your mouth
[31:19] from the abundance of your heart coming
[31:23] out not just an empty thought but you
[31:26] it's reality you're confessing that why
[31:29] because there the very Dove is living in
[31:31] your heart so if the Dove's living in
[31:34] your heart and he's growing every day
[31:36] and he's pushing all that stuff away and
[31:38] he's and he and he's busting the Shu and
[31:41] all the old Shu and husks and things are
[31:43] going because there's a power there's a
[31:45] resurrection inside you
[31:48] amen confess that you're not confessing
[31:52] some external thing from around you
[31:54] you're confessing something that's
[31:55] already in you all of of it it's all
[31:59] there God can only bless you as he
[32:02] confess that as he had done it for you
[32:04] see he's the high priest of our
[32:05] confession is that right Hebrews 3 he
[32:08] said he's the high priest of our
[32:09] confession he can only do for us as we
[32:12] accept it and believe it and confess it
[32:15] amen that's right okay this is a medical
[32:19] View and this is just going to this is
[32:20] like a a general overview of the
[32:23] subconscious and this is amazing because
[32:25] these guys are only really recently
[32:27] discovering this stuff and I said that
[32:29] last time as well but and this is
[32:31] different as well but it's not I'm not
[32:33] reading the same
[32:34] thing brother brandham everything you
[32:36] read here brother brandham just speaks
[32:38] it out in the 50s you know he's more
[32:41] advanced you know like we we we have a
[32:43] message that's more advanced than all
[32:45] the medical stuff but I'm only s I'm
[32:47] only reading this to you because I want
[32:49] to show you that I want to show you that
[32:51] the the tool the the the the the message
[32:55] you have in your heart and in your hand
[32:57] hands that sword is an advanced weapon
[33:01] that sword that came out of a prophet's
[33:03] mouth spread out over all the
[33:05] messages and gathered together under
[33:08] inspiration and ministered and you
[33:09] having your Bible studies and things
[33:11] it's more advanced and the news in there
[33:13] is more later than the news and the
[33:15] papers but it takes Eagles to gather the
[33:18] fresh meat and take that meat and chew
[33:21] it up and live it become one with
[33:24] that amen that's all in there that's all
[33:28] in
[33:30] there in order to understand how the
[33:33] subconscious and conscious minds work
[33:35] together as a team to create your
[33:37] reality remember this is medical too so
[33:39] they don't understand spiritual stuff
[33:41] and the soul and everything so just bear
[33:43] with me let me again use an analogy your
[33:47] subconscious mind is like a deep fertile
[33:50] soil that accepts any seed that you
[33:53] plant within it I repeat that any seed
[33:56] and I'm only I I read through this it is
[33:59] all right you know that you plant within
[34:02] it you decide what seed's going to land
[34:05] right it's going to fly over and you're
[34:08] going to plant something and you better
[34:10] make sure you don't plant all those
[34:11] negative things but you tell that devil
[34:14] where to go amen you resist the devil he
[34:17] will flee from
[34:18] you and submit to God it's like deep
[34:22] fertile soil that accepts any seed you
[34:24] plant within it your habitual thoughts
[34:26] and beliefs
[34:27] other seeds habitual thoughts now you
[34:31] might think a couple of things and then
[34:32] let it fly but you keep thinking along a
[34:34] certain line you just keep doing that
[34:37] eventually it's be it's going to get
[34:38] ingrained in you eventually down here is
[34:41] going to register it yes actually he's
[34:43] thought this enough she's thought this
[34:44] enough I'm going to make this a value in
[34:46] my life I'm going to make this a belief
[34:48] it's going to Anchor something and it's
[34:49] going to become and it's going to go
[34:51] through your brain and it's going to
[34:53] create neural Pathways in your brain and
[34:54] it's going to be very easy to think that
[34:56] it's it's going to be very hard to stop
[34:58] that but God's given us a way out of all
[35:01] of these things he said you can tear
[35:03] down strongholds he's given you a power
[35:05] a dunamis mighty through God pulling
[35:07] down strongholds and casting down
[35:09] imaginations and all those things that
[35:11] would exalt itself against Jesus Christ
[35:13] so it's time now to be a diligent
[35:15] Gardener of your
[35:18] mind that are constantly beliefs are the
[35:21] seeds that are being constantly swn
[35:23] within and they produce in your life
[35:26] what is swn
[35:27] just as surely as corn kernels produce
[35:30] corn and wheat seeds produce wheat your
[35:33] thoughts will have an effect in your
[35:34] life you will reap what you sow this is
[35:37] a law the conscious mind is like the
[35:41] gardener so up here the gardener now
[35:44] remember we as a Christian we take it
[35:46] even further now there's something above
[35:48] the conscious mind that's you your soul
[35:53] and God above that and we're going to
[35:56] get into this in it's might be a good
[35:57] Revelation for some maybe some probably
[36:00] already know but you're going to like it
[36:03] or I did anyway so the conscious mind is
[36:05] like the gardener it is your
[36:07] responsibility to be aware of how this
[36:09] process works and to Choose Wisely what
[36:13] reaches the inner Garden unfortunately
[36:16] for most of us our role as Gardener has
[36:19] never been explained to us now we as
[36:21] Christians know better than that don't
[36:23] we we know that we have a role you know
[36:26] don't let these thoughts come in and we
[36:28] we manage the garden and you see a weed
[36:31] growing and you see something it'll
[36:32] start to make you bitter if it's a
[36:34] negative weed it'll start to bring you
[36:36] down if it's a negative weed it it'll
[36:38] start to affect you negatively as soon
[36:40] as you recognize that there's something
[36:41] taking root now it's time to deal with
[36:44] that it's time to sit before the Lord
[36:46] it's time to get into fellowship with
[36:48] someone you love and trust and I'm
[36:50] thankful that we have a church where we
[36:51] all love and trust each other amen we
[36:53] can just share these things and talk to
[36:55] each other sometimes it's too hard to do
[36:57] it by yourself even though your
[36:59] relationship with God might be awesome
[37:01] it's always good to talk and confess
[37:03] your faults one to another and sit and
[37:05] fellowship and talk about it because
[37:06] they God might speak through them
[37:09] just and and something might happen and
[37:11] you might get free from whatever that is
[37:14] that's hiding down in there that's
[37:16] taking root and causing bitterness or
[37:17] whatever it may be causing it's just
[37:20] he's a troubl maker those weeds grow
[37:22] like you know they're just so easy to
[37:23] grow you don't have to do anything they
[37:24] just grow in the garden you know but
[37:26] those good plants you got to nurture
[37:27] them you know and it's it's just the law
[37:29] you know that's cursed Earth and this
[37:31] Earth here you know it just seems to
[37:33] like weeds a lot and it and and they
[37:35] grow very easy like it said in there
[37:37] there's a very rich fertile soil this
[37:42] mind and and and you we all know the
[37:45] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[37:47] mine and that's the Battleground that
[37:49] Satan and God have both chosen as a
[37:52] place to Warfare rage War unfortunately
[37:56] for for most of us as our Roller Garden
[37:57] has never been explained to us and in
[37:59] misunderstanding this role we have
[38:01] allowed seeds of all types both good and
[38:04] bad to enter the inner Garden of our
[38:06] subconscious the subconscious will not
[38:09] discriminate judge or
[38:11] censor that's very important
[38:14] there and that's why it get that's why
[38:16] it's it becomes a very big problem in
[38:18] our lives is because of whatever you up
[38:21] here yes you can judge and censor and
[38:23] discern yet that's why you should
[38:26] because if you keep thinking negative
[38:27] thoughts that subconscious mind ain't
[38:28] going to go oh stop thinking that it
[38:30] just starts to believe it's like a
[38:32] servant to you and it'll if you keep
[38:34] thinking those things it'll just it'll
[38:35] actually won't censor it it'll just go
[38:38] down there and it'll form a
[38:40] negative
[38:43] opposition it'll form like an opposite
[38:45] political party inside you and and then
[38:48] really you know with a ship analogy that
[38:51] crew cuz up here the captain of the boat
[38:53] you know the conscious mind stearing it
[38:55] in a certain way and you get excited in
[38:57] the church service you get excited by
[38:58] the preaching or you get excited by
[39:00] something then you're like yes I'm going
[39:01] to apply that I'm going to do
[39:03] it but downstairs there a different
[39:06] story the old crew there has been poorly
[39:08] trained for so many years that it says
[39:10] no I'm not doing that that's scary I'm
[39:13] not going to go out there you know what
[39:14] happened last time you did that you know
[39:16] what happened when when you went out
[39:17] there and they looked at you like this
[39:19] and no way you're not going up the front
[39:21] you wouldn't get down on your knees no
[39:22] way and you get all of these feelings
[39:25] like oh I couldn't do that or something
[39:27] you know there's all sorts of we all go
[39:29] through these
[39:30] things it will manif so the subconscious
[39:33] will not discriminate judge or sensor it
[39:35] will manifest success abundance and
[39:37] health just as easy as failure ill
[39:40] health and Misfortune it works to
[39:43] reproduce in our life according to the
[39:45] seeds we have nurtured within your
[39:48] subconscious accepts what is impressed
[39:50] upon it with feeling and repetition
[39:54] whether these thoughts are positive or
[39:55] negative
[39:57] it does not evaluate things like your
[39:59] conscious mind
[40:01] does and I recalling the analogy before
[40:04] because I was going to talk about the
[40:07] ship that crew needs to be
[40:09] retrained the crew down in the bows that
[40:12] actually controlling this that's doing
[40:14] all of these things and making you feel
[40:15] a certain way it needs to be
[40:18] retrained amen the subconscious mind
[40:22] does not discriminate when it comes to
[40:23] thoughts and feelings it responds to
[40:26] fearful thoughts as well as Loving
[40:28] Thoughts the subconscious response to
[40:31] every desire and imaginative thought we
[40:33] choose to
[40:34] entertain now this is now going back to
[40:36] what brother brandham was talking about
[40:38] so you can see that the message we've
[40:40] received is is is 50 years more advanced
[40:42] than what they're just discovering
[40:44] because these things is new to
[40:45] psychology they didn't teach these
[40:47] things they just used to electrocute
[40:49] people and give people pills and they
[40:51] still give people pills and probably do
[40:53] that as well but they've discovered a
[40:55] lot of things here and they're
[40:57] discovering that you don't just use 10%
[40:58] of your brain you there's a whole lot
[41:00] more you know it's like when when when
[41:01] Evolution was concocted In Darwin's
[41:05] books he thought that the cell was just
[41:07] a round thing or soup inside it but
[41:10] there was an advancement of technology
[41:12] and they realize that there's a whole
[41:13] ecosystem of like all these things
[41:16] inside the cell it's like a it's like a
[41:18] it's like a city it's seriously it's
[41:20] like a city inside each cell and every
[41:23] cell contains the very information of
[41:25] Who You Are
[41:26] oh my but the subconscious now recreates
[41:29] that and divides that that's amazing the
[41:32] subconscious responds to every desire
[41:34] and imaginative thought okay so
[41:36] achieving and maintaining some degree of
[41:37] awareness of our thoughts since the
[41:39] subconscious hears every thought and
[41:41] responds accordingly is a certainly a
[41:43] skill worth having and honing our
[41:46] subconscious mind is our friend and is
[41:48] always there for us and never judges any
[41:50] of our thoughts feelings or actions
[41:52] remember our subconscious is the
[41:54] non-critical non-analytical iCal aspect
[41:57] of our mind though we often judge
[41:59] ourselves with our conscious mind
[42:01] according to the belief systems we have
[42:03] created for ourselves as our good friend
[42:06] and Ally our subconscious mind is also
[42:09] extraordinarily protective of us it will
[42:11] repress painful memories until we are
[42:13] ready and willing to heal
[42:15] them and I'm sure that each one of us
[42:19] have been through Council sessions and
[42:20] being through times in church and being
[42:22] through times in our prayer life where
[42:24] God has brought things to the surface
[42:25] and it's been painful and you've felt
[42:27] the very feelings and pain that you felt
[42:30] at the time where you went through a
[42:31] traumatic experience or whatever
[42:33] happened to you and it's down there and
[42:36] you don't even know it's there until
[42:37] finally God just shines his light on it
[42:39] and maybe God shines his light on things
[42:41] in your life and he can deal with them
[42:43] tonight he can deal with them now he can
[42:46] deal with them right in your seat by one
[42:48] simple prayer he can whether he chooses
[42:52] to or whether that's the way it's going
[42:53] to happen for you it's up to you and the
[42:55] Lord and your faith in his promises
[42:58] because no matter who you are bride of
[43:01] Christ you still have to have faith in
[43:05] the word of God you still have to have
[43:07] faith in the word you cannot expect God
[43:09] to just do all these things for you
[43:11] without you believing it without you
[43:12] taking his word seriously and acting
[43:16] upon his word and believing his word and
[43:18] living his word there's he doesn't just
[43:20] want you to live his word so you're just
[43:22] the correct person There's an actual
[43:24] change that happens because it's a
[43:26] practice that's going to retrain the
[43:28] crew downstairs it's going to retrain
[43:31] those people that are driving your ship
[43:33] and and eventually by the practice and
[43:36] by you getting excited in the service
[43:38] and not just sitting like a cardboard
[43:40] cut out but actually being having
[43:42] feelings towards God and maybe there's
[43:45] something that's stopping the feelings
[43:46] towards God and maybe he wants to shine
[43:48] his light upon those things so that you
[43:50] can have a clear channel of relationship
[43:52] with him
[43:53] amen oh there's so many things and it
[43:56] goes beyond and I'm not even going to
[43:57] start to think that I have every answer
[43:59] to all these things because I don't and
[44:01] I'm not even there yet but I'm on my way
[44:04] amen hallelujah we're all on a journey
[44:07] it just happens to be that the Lord
[44:08] allowed me to access these things a
[44:10] little bit but I I'm not preaching from
[44:12] a point where I've completely ought all
[44:14] this stuff I'm just on my journey just
[44:16] like you and everyone else
[44:20] amen
[44:22] hallelujah right so I've drawn some
[44:24] diagrams and these took a lot of thought
[44:27] uh trust me a lot it's it's not you get
[44:31] something in your mind and and to get it
[44:33] out it can be a different story but it's
[44:36] out thank the Lord so here is a diagram
[44:39] right now this is the flesh obviously
[44:43] now this re please don't think that this
[44:46] is just exactly perfect or whatever or
[44:48] what it's meant to look like I don't
[44:49] know but this is how the the Revelation
[44:52] that the Lord's given me on this this is
[44:54] just how I've drawn it so I don't know
[44:58] exactly how this is the best way to draw
[45:00] it but I couldn't think of anything
[45:02] better so here and and your subconscious
[45:06] mind is not a triangle by the way I
[45:08] don't know what shape it is it probably
[45:10] doesn't have a shape because it's a
[45:11] spirit but I've just given it a shape
[45:13] because I just wanted to place it so
[45:15] that we could have some
[45:17] teaching so here we got the heart and I
[45:20] want to start with the this is a child
[45:23] of God before Christ
[45:27] I'm not going to deal with people that
[45:28] aren't children of God or whatever but
[45:30] I'm dealing with two this is a child of
[45:32] God BC and AD because this is what I'm
[45:36] talking to or who I'm talking to so here
[45:39] we have the heart now the heart the
[45:42] Bible says the heart is deep beyond all
[45:45] things and who can know it you know it's
[45:49] just it's be it's beyond comprehension
[45:52] because now the reason why is because
[45:55] here your your heart is comprised of
[45:57] your
[45:57] subconscious
[45:59] mind which as we already have gone
[46:02] through it does a lot of things but it's
[46:04] also home to your soul and your
[46:09] heart and within your
[46:12] soul before Christ is a little
[46:14] predestinated
[46:16] seed but you see there's a snake inside
[46:19] here too now this is that old nature
[46:21] this is that old God of this world that
[46:25] is is born you're born in sin shaped in
[46:28] iniquity and you come to this world
[46:29] speaking lies you come in this world and
[46:31] you're born and there brother brandom
[46:33] said there's a snake inside your heart
[46:35] and that snake is what makes you snaky
[46:37] and makes you who why you went and did
[46:39] all those things and whatever that
[46:42] happened but and and but inside there is
[46:46] also a predestined
[46:48] seed it was was waiting for the day of
[46:50] its new birth and it's a seed laying
[46:52] under muck and dirt like Reverend Mr
[46:55] Lily are down in the muck of the pond
[46:58] and there's a bit of toiling that
[47:00] happens before he comes up to show
[47:03] right but I'm so thankful that the light
[47:06] of God to Quicken that seed can shine
[47:08] down through the water and down through
[47:10] the mck and mire all this this is the
[47:13] mukan mire the clay and penetrate the
[47:16] soil and it can also this is the
[47:18] Glorious thing cuz God starts to work
[47:20] within right he can penetrate Roman
[47:24] tombstones and walls of Jericho and all
[47:27] those things that can concrete over the
[47:30] believer and he can penetrate it all to
[47:32] get to that seed because he's going to
[47:34] start from within the Enemy Lines amen
[47:37] and what he does is he comes in and he
[47:39] kicks that snake out the conscious mind
[47:43] I've got the conscious mind here
[47:44] represented as a tri the red part here
[47:48] now think of the subconscious and the
[47:51] conscious mind as like an iceberg the
[47:54] conscious mind is about 5% of your
[47:56] spirit 5% of you of your of your of who
[48:00] you are 5% and that's the bit that's
[48:04] that's like the the
[48:07] um the interface of you that's what
[48:11] people know you is it's what people see
[48:12] you as and it's influenced by a few
[48:15] different things it's you you you as a
[48:17] conscious person the thing when you're
[48:19] speaking when you're doing stuff the
[48:21] captain of the ship is influenced it's
[48:24] influenced by a whole it's influenced by
[48:26] a myriad of things it's influenced by if
[48:29] you're not born again by this
[48:32] snake it's influenced by this flesh and
[48:35] what comes in from all of the senses and
[48:39] it's definitely influenced by this
[48:41] subconscious and you can see I've got it
[48:44] wrapped around there just a little
[48:47] bit and there's a purpose for that I'm
[48:49] going to talk about it soon why that
[48:52] subconscious is wrapped around and this
[48:54] poor conscious mine here is basically
[48:58] your interface it's 5% so day-to-day
[49:01] life you doing this and doing that and
[49:04] everything like that you is only 5%
[49:08] there's 95% of your daily activities and
[49:11] things that's happening around you
[49:12] that's run by your
[49:14] subconscious and if that's got problems
[49:17] and issues then you've got problems and
[49:19] issues and you got troubles and and
[49:23] God's got a he's going to be busy and is
[49:25] busy on all of us thank the Lord that
[49:27] he's busy amen he's got nail scarred
[49:30] hands he's so busy hallelujah amen he's
[49:33] made provision for everything am to free
[49:36] us from all these things so don't be
[49:37] overbear and overburdened by it all
[49:40] because you are inevitably getting
[49:42] healed and all you need to do is ask
[49:46] that's all you need to do it's not this
[49:47] big complicated thing it's just simple
[49:51] but it's you've got to be willing to let
[49:53] God deal with these things you've got
[49:55] got to be willing to go come to counsel
[49:58] and I don't mean I'm not like saying go
[49:59] and see Ben and counsel and whatever if
[50:01] you feel on your heart to do that do
[50:02] that you know sometimes you need to do
[50:05] that or you need to confide in somebody
[50:08] sister brother whatever and have
[50:09] fellowship and talk about these things
[50:12] because you see as you talk about these
[50:14] things the inspiration and iron
[50:15] sharpeneth iron and and and and and
[50:18] things can happen and God can deal amen
[50:22] hallelujah don't hold on to things the
[50:25] conscious mind the Reigns of the person
[50:29] in the hands of the snake filled heart
[50:32] and influenced by the human flesh and
[50:34] the sick subconscious so I've got this
[50:37] as a sick subconscious because it is
[50:40] sick and was sick it's not won't remain
[50:43] sick but it's getting healed it's
[50:45] getting renovated like we read in the
[50:47] beginning it says to be renovated in the
[50:50] spirit of your
[50:51] mind
[50:53] amen now and and I please just don't be
[50:56] overburdened by all of this information
[50:59] you can watch this again and study it I
[51:01] I I I do encourage you to get this and
[51:05] look it over and pray about it and ask
[51:07] God to show you because I'm just going
[51:08] to preach it out but please listen to it
[51:11] again because there is a lot of
[51:12] information here and it's taken me a
[51:14] long time to bring it all into a simple
[51:19] format then you got the
[51:21] flesh the flesh itself this is
[51:24] influenced by the sick
[51:26] subconscious because remember the
[51:28] subconscious has all it produces all the
[51:29] feelings and so this flesh is if your
[51:33] subconscious is sick and it's not in a
[51:35] good shape then and you're going to have
[51:37] physical emotions arai you're going to
[51:40] have emotions that happen and
[51:41] depressions and and overe excitement
[51:43] about things that you shouldn't maybe
[51:45] lustful stuff that that that something's
[51:48] been down in you or affections and you
[51:50] like something that God doesn't
[51:53] like it's going to affect this flesh
[51:55] you're going to physically feel like
[51:56] taking that thing or having that or
[51:58] consuming this that you don't meant to
[52:01] because down in that subconscious there
[52:02] is a it's drawing comfort from whatever
[52:05] those things
[52:06] are because there needs to be a
[52:09] renovation because there's a crew down
[52:12] there in the ship that is a little bit
[52:15] not
[52:16] compliant but you see he will be
[52:19] compliant but you need to retrain them
[52:23] by your thoughts by your confession by
[52:26] what you're saying and by what you're
[52:28] doing because you have a choice you
[52:32] choose what you expose yourself
[52:34] to
[52:36] amen and if you find it's too hard to
[52:40] stop something or or or you know you
[52:42] find it too hard what the reason that is
[52:45] is because the black dog's stronger
[52:47] there's two dogs inside every person no
[52:50] matter what their condition is now you
[52:54] can choose which one you feed and the
[52:56] more you feed the black one he's going
[52:58] to get stronger the more you feed the
[52:59] white one he's going to get stronger so
[53:02] maybe you're struggling with certain
[53:04] things and you want to get
[53:07] Deliverance but you're finding it too
[53:09] hard what you need to do is make a
[53:12] conscious decision by the captain here
[53:14] to start feeding more on the word and
[53:17] maybe you find it hard to read the word
[53:19] listen put it on during the day maybe
[53:22] you need to listen to more sermons just
[53:24] put them on your I phone or iPod get it
[53:26] in your sensors get it in your ears and
[53:29] get it in your eyes you can make that
[53:31] decision and it can feed that white dog
[53:33] and maybe you might not be able to stop
[53:36] feeding the black dog but at least
[53:37] you're feeding the white dog and as
[53:39] you're feeding the white dog he's going
[53:40] to come and eat that guy amen and and
[53:42] things are going to change and you'll
[53:44] start to find it easier now this is a
[53:46] very practical application because I
[53:48] myself had this very similar situation I
[53:51] was stuck on all sorts of substances and
[53:54] everything and I something the Lord just
[53:57] reminded me of that very thing about
[53:59] feeding the white dog and so I was still
[54:02] doing those
[54:03] things but I started listening to
[54:05] sermons and I only listened to it
[54:06] quietly because I just couldn't bear to
[54:08] hear what he was saying but it actually
[54:10] fed my subconscious it started feeding
[54:12] my spirit and that white dog got strong
[54:14] enough till I could actually became an
[54:17] overthrow of government there became an
[54:20] overthrow and the the balance of power
[54:23] was tipped and then it became easier to
[54:26] throw those things off because my mind
[54:29] started becoming clearer so maybe you're
[54:32] in a situation where you're struggling
[54:33] to give something up or whatever it may
[54:35] be but it's time to just make that
[54:38] conscious decision from the
[54:40] captain's Bridge or whatever you call it
[54:43] to start feeding the white dog and and
[54:46] and provide make provision for the Lord
[54:49] make provision and give him something to
[54:51] work
[54:52] with amen
[54:55] and then you'll be able to give that
[54:56] thing up because there will be an
[54:58] overthrow and the balance of power will
[55:00] be
[55:02] tipped so the flesh itself is influenced
[55:04] by the Sick subconscious and the
[55:06] negative neural Pathways sorry this is a
[55:09] lot of information but please the flesh
[55:12] leading most unconverted humans today so
[55:16] most unconverted humans are led by this
[55:19] they're led by this Hollywood Babylonian
[55:23] television God of
[55:26] Satan that's not the god of Satan but
[55:29] anyway you know what I
[55:33] mean so and and all that stuff is going
[55:37] in and they're led by feelings and then
[55:38] it's just this big cycle cuz the
[55:41] subconscious is so filthy and so hurt
[55:44] and so pain and so they just take all
[55:46] these things and do all these things to
[55:47] make themselves comfortable because they
[55:49] don't have the
[55:50] comforter but a born again person hello
[55:53] everybody is actually got a comforter
[55:56] and he wants to be your comforter of
[55:58] every area of your life and it's time
[56:01] you started confessing that it's time
[56:03] you started confessing that he is the
[56:05] source of all your comfort it's time to
[56:07] start singing thou the spring of all my
[56:10] comfort more than life to me whom have I
[56:12] on Earth beside thee whom in heaven but
[56:14] thee that's a confession that confess it
[56:18] untils down here the crew believes it
[56:21] and starts going maybe Jesus is my
[56:23] comforter maybe he is and because
[56:27] upstairs they keep talking about it the
[56:30] captain's orders keep coming down all
[56:32] the time he is our comforter he's the
[56:34] source of all my comfort my affections
[56:37] are set on things above
[56:41] amen man we're never going to get
[56:43] through this I'm going to be very well
[56:45] behaved now please please be only 8:20
[56:48] oh
[56:50] man oh dear okay I'm going to go about
[56:54] 9:15 is that is that okay okay cool
[56:57] sorry I know it's going to run a little
[56:58] bit later but I have to get through this
[57:00] otherwise we ain't going to we have to
[57:02] CU there's a conclusion but I I promise
[57:04] I'll just read I'll only preach a little
[57:07] bit the physical mind now so now you've
[57:11] got the conscious mind now this is the
[57:13] spirit of your mind right this is not a
[57:14] physical part of you but it controls a
[57:17] lot of you and it's a spiritual part of
[57:19] your mind but there is a physical mind
[57:22] now this is your brain and it's it's a
[57:25] very powerful instrument and it's so
[57:27] amazing and it's part of you now the
[57:30] physical mind under the leadership of
[57:33] evil remember before Christ under the
[57:35] leadership of evil thousands of rutted
[57:39] neural Pathways the thoughts that go
[57:41] through your mind all the time it starts
[57:43] to forge physical Pathways in your mind
[57:48] and it becomes very easy it's like going
[57:50] down a bush track and there's ruts in
[57:52] the road and the car just goes that way
[57:55] right it just goes in there it falls in
[57:56] there you got to if you if you got to
[57:58] fight to stay out of them you know if
[58:00] you want to get traction on the dry
[58:02] stuff well that's like that kind of in
[58:04] your mind the more you think a certain
[58:06] thing the more you testify a certain
[58:08] thing it starts to form a plasticity
[58:10] that's called neuroplasticity and it's
[58:12] actually a medical term that the more
[58:14] you think a certain way that starts to
[58:17] form and Forge these physical Pathways
[58:20] or electrical Pathways in your mind and
[58:23] it starts to bridge these things
[58:24] together and you it becomes a belief it
[58:26] becomes a value and it becomes an
[58:29] efficient way of thinking for you
[58:31] whether positive or negative now
[58:33] unfortunately because of people in the
[58:35] world and the whole influence of
[58:37] everything you know these neural
[58:39] pathways are detrimental habits and
[58:42] complexes which govern the human mind
[58:45] the subconscious mind now this guy here
[58:49] this forms about 95% of the human spirit
[58:52] and it's generally laying sick the the
[58:54] unconverted
[58:56] soul laying under the rule of the sick
[58:59] human Spirit and the flesh what a place
[59:02] to be in trampled down that soul and
[59:07] Satan he somehow he I'm sure and I it's
[59:10] just me I'm sure he knows the ones that
[59:12] have the seed because I I just I just
[59:15] have this it's an inference from an
[59:18] inference from that lady that knew
[59:20] brother Bram was had a gift right they
[59:23] could see and if she just a human with a
[59:25] demon spirit in her I'm sure the devil
[59:28] sees gifts in our life I'm sure the
[59:30] devil knows that there's something
[59:31] special about you before you were and so
[59:34] what did he do and I know he did it to
[59:36] me and allly can also Express he tries
[59:38] to destroy and he tries to take you down
[59:40] a life that you that you shouldn't go
[59:42] down and and I I had many times where I
[59:45] could have died many times and I'm sure
[59:48] you could all testify of times where you
[59:51] thought the devil's tried to destroy me
[59:54] many many times and but he couldn't
[59:58] because there was that inside me the
[1:00:00] predestined seed but it was that the
[1:00:03] soul of mine was laying under the was
[1:00:07] being crushed under the flesh crushed
[1:00:09] under the human spirit all the feelings
[1:00:12] and emotions and all of the the things
[1:00:14] of this world and and all of the the
[1:00:17] waves and of fessions and lust and all
[1:00:21] these things going on just a complete
[1:00:22] unstable thing but the soul was being
[1:00:25] crushed
[1:00:26] underfoot but that wasn't the end of the
[1:00:30] story
[1:00:32] because when a child of God is born
[1:00:35] again that predestined seed becomes
[1:00:39] quickened and that the dove flies into
[1:00:43] the
[1:00:44] heart and God takes up a bod in
[1:00:48] you and quickens that light penetrated
[1:00:51] the soil and Quicken that seed and that
[1:00:53] seed starts to grow grow as you feed at
[1:00:56] the word of God as you walk in the light
[1:00:59] and as you as the rain and the light
[1:01:01] comes upon it it starts to grow and the
[1:01:04] headship of God takes place and that
[1:01:06] Soul takes Dominion Hallelujah takes
[1:01:10] complete Dominion in your life and it
[1:01:13] starts now I've got this drawn as in a
[1:01:16] utopic condition because this is where
[1:01:18] we're heading this is where we're going
[1:01:20] see there's no blackness in there
[1:01:23] there's no darkness in there because
[1:01:24] this is the when God takes headship when
[1:01:27] the soul gets Dominion Hallelujah and
[1:01:30] the word of God takes the place in your
[1:01:32] life Hallelujah and the the captain now
[1:01:36] gets a you know he becomes an ambassador
[1:01:38] for the dove comes becomes an ambassador
[1:01:41] for heaven now he's got power behind him
[1:01:44] now that captain in the ship's got power
[1:01:46] behind him and he's being influenced by
[1:01:49] a greater power because this power has
[1:01:51] come into your life to give you dominion
[1:01:54] over your spirit to give you dominion
[1:01:58] over your conscious mind and over your
[1:02:01] subconscious and definitely over your
[1:02:04] flesh until finally as it says he that
[1:02:07] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:02:09] also Quicken your mortal body so this
[1:02:12] physical mortal body that's cursed can
[1:02:14] actually be completely quickened by the
[1:02:19] glory that excelth that comes out and it
[1:02:22] starts to expand in your life and starts
[1:02:24] to drive out every little trait and heal
[1:02:26] your heart from within now it's time you
[1:02:29] started testifying of that it's time you
[1:02:31] started speaking of that and thinking of
[1:02:34] that and making positive testimony of
[1:02:38] these things in your life and what the
[1:02:40] word says about you you just say that
[1:02:42] you're not lying you're not lying it's
[1:02:46] the truth even though you might not feel
[1:02:49] like it's the truth even though it might
[1:02:51] seem absolutely unlogical
[1:02:55] there's a different logic that's come
[1:02:56] down from heaven and that's Heavenly
[1:02:58] logic that's Bible logic that logic is
[1:03:01] more logic than the logic you learn in
[1:03:02] the school that's Satan's logic in there
[1:03:05] that says this and then this and cause
[1:03:07] and effect they're only basing that on
[1:03:09] their limited P brain
[1:03:12] experience man it's all wrong well some
[1:03:15] of it's right because it's basic but a
[1:03:17] lot of it just wrong and you know it's
[1:03:19] been so ingrained in US Satan used us
[1:03:21] because used that because he got us in
[1:03:23] school and he taught us all these things
[1:03:24] for so many years and you start to think
[1:03:27] and then because it just starts to you
[1:03:30] you cast down reasoning you cast down
[1:03:32] those things all those thoughts and
[1:03:35] logicos
[1:03:37] logic because you see there's a Heavenly
[1:03:40] logic coming in here and he's now taken
[1:03:43] your soul into dominion and placed you
[1:03:46] above your spirit and your flesh to make
[1:03:48] a happy home this happy
[1:03:51] home and so now here this subconscious
[1:03:55] here becomes a happy spirit that can
[1:03:58] keep the house tidy can put a good
[1:04:00] atmosphere in the house can clean the
[1:04:02] house can can produce good chemicals in
[1:04:05] every circumstance so that you can sit
[1:04:07] in any situation and you're content you
[1:04:10] have peace your body feels happy because
[1:04:14] your spirit's happy and she is ordained
[1:04:16] to keep your house amen she is the wife
[1:04:20] in your
[1:04:21] life whether you're male or female you
[1:04:24] have a keeper of your house and she's
[1:04:27] keeping that body
[1:04:30] amen the flesh body I'm going to just
[1:04:32] read these things
[1:04:34] now the flesh body is now governed by
[1:04:36] the positive subconscious which is
[1:04:39] undergoing complete renovation remember
[1:04:43] being
[1:04:44] renewed so here has come the new
[1:04:47] management and he's now quickened your
[1:04:50] soul and now he's starting to clean all
[1:04:53] the stuff out out and throw all these
[1:04:56] things back into balance over time it
[1:04:59] won't happen all at once but little by
[1:05:03] little will I deliver your out your
[1:05:05] enemies into your hands and I will drive
[1:05:08] out the jebusites and the Hittites and
[1:05:10] the habites and the ibites and the cadit
[1:05:13] I'll drive them all out little by little
[1:05:15] turn not to the left or to the right
[1:05:16] just keep walking with me and confessing
[1:05:19] the word acting upon the truth
[1:05:22] confessing the truth that is already
[1:05:23] with in you because he's already within
[1:05:26] you he's not somewhere far off he's
[1:05:27] right here and he's speaking out and
[1:05:30] that becomes the abundance of your
[1:05:34] heart which is undergoing complete
[1:05:36] renovation now coming into chemical
[1:05:38] balance your body now your body why is
[1:05:40] your body coming into chemical
[1:05:42] balance why is it producing the right
[1:05:45] hormones all the time and the right
[1:05:46] things at the right
[1:05:48] time because you've got a healthy
[1:05:51] Spirit the one that does all the
[1:05:53] chemical stuff and and all of the
[1:05:54] everything inside you
[1:05:57] physically she's happy because there's
[1:06:00] better Management in there amen your
[1:06:02] Soul's meant to be at headship in the
[1:06:04] home but always under the headship of
[1:06:07] Christ it's like a normal house and we'
[1:06:10] got some diagrams coming I'm really
[1:06:12] looking forward to those diagrams and I
[1:06:13] put them last because I know that after
[1:06:16] all of this you get tired and it's a
[1:06:17] visual stuff's easier so so it says here
[1:06:22] now coming into chemical balance and
[1:06:24] being well-kept by The Keeper of the
[1:06:26] house the Healthy Mind and
[1:06:29] Spirit the physical mind under the
[1:06:31] leadership of God who is renovating the
[1:06:35] neural Pathways in your mind the
[1:06:38] intellect that influences the Mind
[1:06:40] through feelings and habits the
[1:06:42] subconscious mind comes under the
[1:06:44] training of God conscious
[1:06:48] leadership because now this conscious
[1:06:50] mind up here has got a bitter influence
[1:06:53] she he's influenced by the the Dove and
[1:06:57] now the chemicals are right so you're
[1:07:00] feeling good the conscious mind is the
[1:07:03] the emotions are coming into balance and
[1:07:05] now that you it becomes a a god
[1:07:08] conscious leadership the captain of the
[1:07:10] ship's got better navigation control
[1:07:13] better navigation systems better Radars
[1:07:15] in the in the bridge and all those
[1:07:16] things I'm sure we could
[1:07:20] get brother Chris here to give some
[1:07:22] analogies of those things or but I don't
[1:07:25] know but there's a lot of things that's
[1:07:26] in the ship you know and and and it's
[1:07:27] better to have an
[1:07:29] upgrade you know back before the Lord
[1:07:31] comes in and before he started
[1:07:34] renovating you know maybe it was just
[1:07:36] one of those Wheels with all the things
[1:07:38] on it the old pirate wheels and they
[1:07:40] flick them and it just turns and that's
[1:07:42] about it in the ship but now you know
[1:07:44] the Lord's coming and he's put an
[1:07:45] advancement so you can see further and
[1:07:48] you can produce better and you can have
[1:07:50] a better godc conscious leadership in
[1:07:51] your
[1:07:52] life
[1:07:56] the converted Soul placed in dominion
[1:07:59] over the spirit and
[1:08:01] flesh under the headship of God and the
[1:08:04] dove symbolizes God Of Heaven which flew
[1:08:07] into our heart when we were sealed in
[1:08:09] aren't you so glad he flew into your
[1:08:11] heart aren't you so glad that he's
[1:08:13] performing a great renovation in your
[1:08:16] spirit amen aren't you so glad he gave
[1:08:18] your soul put it into its position and
[1:08:21] placed it in the shakina glory presence
[1:08:24] so that you so that that you know when
[1:08:26] Aaron's Rod was placed into the shikina
[1:08:28] glory you know it turned from a dry dead
[1:08:31] old stick and overnight it became a
[1:08:33] fruitful tree that had armonds on it
[1:08:36] amen so now your soul is living in that
[1:08:40] presence Hallelujah but you see now it's
[1:08:42] not enough it wants there has to be a an
[1:08:45] overthrow now and a renovation of the
[1:08:48] spirit and the quickening of the flesh
[1:08:50] this Mortal body Mortal Mortal now not
[1:08:55] Immortal body the quickening of the
[1:08:57] Mortal body it's got to come into a
[1:08:59] place where it's completely subject and
[1:09:01] the glory that is the shakina that's
[1:09:05] already your soul is in comes out and it
[1:09:08] becomes you and you start to dwell in a
[1:09:11] realm of perfect faith and you become a
[1:09:12] Mystic to people around you you become
[1:09:14] fearless and unconscious of all
[1:09:16] circumstances and you not moved one bit
[1:09:19] one slight
[1:09:21] iot Hallelujah by anything that happens
[1:09:25] only what the
[1:09:27] captain gives you directions
[1:09:32] for I want to ask you something how many
[1:09:34] in here ever you know you got a
[1:09:37] subconscious don't you we are conscious
[1:09:39] of that that's the fellow that
[1:09:41] subconscious causing you all the trouble
[1:09:43] tonight it don't agree with this one out
[1:09:46] here the conscious mind it's scared and
[1:09:48] backs up but when it becomes in harmony
[1:09:50] with this one and this one becomes in
[1:09:52] harmony with God's word
[1:09:54] you're going then you're moving in a
[1:09:57] Direction that's under that the dove
[1:09:59] Direction the dove leading the eagle I
[1:10:03] don't know if you've heard brother Brown
[1:10:04] talk about that but the dove the
[1:10:05] Heavenly Dove leading the
[1:10:08] eagle you're an
[1:10:10] eaglet amen the dove led the eagle
[1:10:13] brother brandom now the dove is leading
[1:10:16] you Hallelujah as it all comes into
[1:10:19] harmony so where the dove leads you will
[1:10:22] go
[1:10:24] but if the if there's a if there's a
[1:10:26] realm in your life that's not in harmony
[1:10:28] the dove leads and then it's got to
[1:10:30] battle again and then the dove leades
[1:10:32] that way and it's got to battle again
[1:10:33] and you so he what he does is he just
[1:10:35] deals with those things deals with
[1:10:37] everything in your
[1:10:38] life just ask him Lord deal with this
[1:10:43] deal with me heal my heart let no stone
[1:10:47] be
[1:10:47] unturned I lay it all out to you heal me
[1:10:52] take away the desire for to the things
[1:10:54] of this world
[1:10:58] it I after through the oh no I'm just
[1:11:00] going to go past
[1:11:02] this the murmurs in the
[1:11:04] wilderness man I just don't have time to
[1:11:06] preach any of day no I think I'll pick
[1:11:10] this up next time but
[1:11:12] basically fear cripples Faith so in your
[1:11:17] subconscious is all these different
[1:11:18] things and memories and stuff so what
[1:11:20] Satan does when a promise comes your way
[1:11:22] God wants to give you something
[1:11:23] something Satan will come around behind
[1:11:25] and give you fear and make you feel like
[1:11:27] you can't have it because you're not
[1:11:28] good enough or you've not performed
[1:11:30] enough or you've you've done all the sin
[1:11:31] and you've done wrong but God's not
[1:11:33] looking at those things God God wants
[1:11:35] you to take him at his word and enter
[1:11:38] your land and go forward and claim it
[1:11:41] regardless of circumstances regardless
[1:11:43] of how you feel regardless of your
[1:11:45] performance claim the word speak the
[1:11:47] word live the word act it out and see it
[1:11:50] become flesh in your life amen don't let
[1:11:53] fear because the moment fear comes into
[1:11:56] your life it cripples your faith and
[1:11:58] then the Devil comes in and he starts to
[1:12:00] twist you around in thoughts and make
[1:12:01] you think all of these things and by the
[1:12:03] time you've just completely lost the
[1:12:04] vision and you know worry causes Amnesia
[1:12:07] and you forget who you are and you spend
[1:12:09] two or three weeks in a in a clouded
[1:12:11] State and you don't even know who you
[1:12:12] are but recognize who you are speak the
[1:12:16] word because it's the truth and it's
[1:12:18] within
[1:12:21] you we'll go through that later
[1:12:24] man this is real good but I'm going to
[1:12:26] do it next time I was so looking forward
[1:12:28] to this but I'll go
[1:12:31] straight are you really leading your
[1:12:36] spirit or is your spirit leading
[1:12:41] you Romans 6 likewise reckon ye
[1:12:44] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[1:12:46] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] Our Lord let not sin let not sin you
[1:12:52] have a choice
[1:12:53] because you've got Dominion you have a
[1:12:56] choice let not sin unbelief all those
[1:12:59] thoughts everything all the stuff that
[1:13:00] comes and makes you feel like you've you
[1:13:02] lost your faith and lost identity and
[1:13:04] all those things let it not rain in your
[1:13:06] mortal body it will try there will be an
[1:13:09] uprising there will be many uprisings
[1:13:12] there will be many coups that happen to
[1:13:14] try and overthrow the the power in your
[1:13:16] life let it not you've got authority
[1:13:19] over it you just be led by the dove amen
[1:13:24] I'm so thankful for this cold air man

[1:13:30] hot but I'd be more hot if I didn't have
[1:13:35] this neither yield your members oh let
[1:13:38] not sin therefore reain in your mortal
[1:13:40] body to that you should obey it in the
[1:13:42] lusts thereof neither yield your members
[1:13:45] as instruments of unrighteousness Unto
[1:13:47] sin but yield yourselves unto God as
[1:13:49] those that are alive from the dead and
[1:13:51] your members as instruments of
[1:13:52] righteousness unto God for sin shall not
[1:13:55] have dominion over you for ye are not
[1:13:59] under the law but under grace Hallelujah
[1:14:02] the grace of God the enabling power of
[1:14:04] God to come behind every testimony that
[1:14:07] you testify and every thought of the
[1:14:09] word that you think to to blast the
[1:14:11] devil out to take whatever right hand
[1:14:13] that he's got in your life and give him
[1:14:15] God's right hand Amen to punch him down
[1:14:17] and kick him down and stomp on him amen
[1:14:20] because you've got to stomp on the neck
[1:14:21] of your enemy amen
[1:14:23] that is by faith now don't let those
[1:14:26] things and now we're going to go right
[1:14:28] into those things next time about
[1:14:31] fear because that will Faith
[1:14:35] it's a it's a very basic thing but fear
[1:14:38] cripples Faith you've got to overcome
[1:14:41] the things in your life well God will do
[1:14:42] it for you and help you that are causing
[1:14:45] fear and fear is you could someone could
[1:14:48] tell you a promise healing right there's
[1:14:51] something that you got a sickness and it
[1:14:52] could be bad
[1:14:54] and then and when healing and then the
[1:14:57] promise of healing comes and then
[1:14:58] there's a thought down deep maybe it's
[1:15:00] not for me that's fear you're feared
[1:15:04] because something's crippled the faith
[1:15:05] you might not know what it is but God
[1:15:07] knows and he can put the light on it
[1:15:10] you've just got to let him and you've
[1:15:11] got to have that Fellowship you've got
[1:15:13] to come under his shakina and his light
[1:15:16] The Keeper of the house I I won't go
[1:15:18] into this I'll go straight
[1:15:22] to
[1:15:25] so this is a Biblical
[1:15:32] household I won't read that because you
[1:15:34] guys know that so well but it's
[1:15:35] Ephesians 5:22 to2 just read it when
[1:15:37] you're when you're at home if you can um
[1:15:40] it's about why it's the it's the
[1:15:41] relationship in the home but here you
[1:15:44] have the thoughts of God and the flow of
[1:15:46] God's love and many other things I just
[1:15:48] chose those to for the purpose of this
[1:15:51] and you've got your home right uh a
[1:15:53] normal house with a with Jesus as the
[1:15:56] head of the home and and now funneling
[1:15:59] through Jesus comes the very love of God
[1:16:02] comes the thoughts of God the word of
[1:16:04] God the will of God the purpose of God
[1:16:07] the plan the power and it comes into the
[1:16:09] husband and he's a funnel and he funnels
[1:16:12] that you know and his channels become
[1:16:14] clean and he starts to submit to God and
[1:16:17] he becomes um um a benevolent leader and
[1:16:20] he becomes transparent and sincere he
[1:16:22] starts to represent his origin
[1:16:25] Hallelujah and that origin is God's love
[1:16:27] and his thoughts and it comes through
[1:16:29] there and it comes down into the wife
[1:16:31] and she becomes happy because you see
[1:16:34] this is the flow this is the way God's
[1:16:36] designed it and it comes down and it
[1:16:39] flows into the home and the home is
[1:16:40] clean sincere it's got a good atmosphere
[1:16:44] it's healthy it's balanced it's Godly
[1:16:46] and the children are affected by this
[1:16:48] amen there is a clear representation of
[1:16:51] above now when these things in problems
[1:16:53] in this and this you know it's it
[1:16:57] becomes what comes out of here can be
[1:16:59] slightly different than what's up here
[1:17:01] and unfortunately for us that has
[1:17:03] happened many times and hopefully and
[1:17:05] I'm so thankful that we don't have to
[1:17:07] repeat that because we're hearing it now
[1:17:09] let's change let's let God deal with it
[1:17:11] and let's not administer this message
[1:17:14] like our parents brought us up
[1:17:16] okay let's administer this message by
[1:17:19] the way God the love of God and the
[1:17:21] thoughts of God amen God's come to take
[1:17:24] over amen what was preached about for so
[1:17:27] many years has become flesh the very
[1:17:30] mind of Christ is here why because he's
[1:17:33] come to take over he's taken over this
[1:17:35] place amen I love that it's powerful I
[1:17:38] won't
[1:17:42] preach now I'm likingness to the body
[1:17:46] biblical leadership in the body which is
[1:17:48] also a
[1:17:51] house that doesn't need need to have
[1:17:53] that house on there this is your house
[1:17:55] and it's exactly the same true identity
[1:17:59] the thoughts of God healing the flow of
[1:18:01] God's love Revelation coming through
[1:18:04] Jesus Christ into the soul to the spirit
[1:18:08] when I say through it it's from Jesus
[1:18:10] Christ okay so don't think that there's
[1:18:12] something more or it's just that I've
[1:18:14] drawn it this way because it's like you
[1:18:17] know the Eternal God and all of who he
[1:18:19] is is pour into Christ and everything
[1:18:21] that was pour into Christ is pour into
[1:18:22] the church CH so that's why I've drawn
[1:18:24] it like that but he is the source as
[1:18:26] well of course so and then through Jesus
[1:18:29] Christ into the
[1:18:31] soul you that's you you've been given
[1:18:35] Dominion in your home you've been raised
[1:18:36] to the head of your home he's the head
[1:18:39] over you but you become the head and now
[1:18:42] your spirit comes under benevolent
[1:18:45] leadership real leadership you become
[1:18:48] really sincere lay your life what is
[1:18:51] sincerity sincerity isn't just just
[1:18:53] acting good being like serious sincerity
[1:18:56] is representing your
[1:18:58] origin a true representation of who you
[1:19:01] are how do you get there death to
[1:19:03] self die to yourself and all your
[1:19:05] opinions and all the opinions of
[1:19:07] everyone else that's contrary and just
[1:19:09] be a clear representation of your origin
[1:19:12] of your
[1:19:13] father and then what will happen you
[1:19:16] know you just become you lay it all out
[1:19:17] and then the very flow of God comes into
[1:19:21] your spirit and she starts to get dealt
[1:19:22] with and she starts to produce healthy
[1:19:24] emotions become a clean body a sincere
[1:19:27] body Atmos a good atmosphere in the body
[1:19:30] produced by chemicals produced by good
[1:19:33] emotions and good chemicals and it's all
[1:19:35] balanced because the creator of the body
[1:19:38] is living in the body amen the creator
[1:19:41] of the body is here you know the Creator
[1:19:43] and now he can come down and he can
[1:19:45] cause this and flow right in and you
[1:19:47] have a healthy balanced Godly influence
[1:19:50] in your
[1:19:51] life
[1:19:56] unbiblical leadership in the body I mean
[1:20:00] these things are sermons in themselves
[1:20:01] please I'm going to go into it more
[1:20:03] trust me uh this is just now it's kind
[1:20:06] of like a bit of an overview as well I
[1:20:07] want to break this down as well so just
[1:20:09] bear with me but now this is laying a
[1:20:12] good foundation unbiblical leadership in
[1:20:14] the body this so here you have the same
[1:20:17] thing the flow of God's love and the
[1:20:19] thoughts of God coming in but you see
[1:20:21] now what has happened
[1:20:23] what if the spirit is leading the body
[1:20:25] if your spirit if you're run by your
[1:20:28] feelings and your emotions youve broken
[1:20:31] the word of God because you have now and
[1:20:34] something has happened in your life and
[1:20:36] it's caused your spirit to be so unruly
[1:20:38] and so scarred and so hurt and broken
[1:20:42] that it's leading your life and that's
[1:20:44] causing you to do all these things all
[1:20:45] the time and you don't want to do them
[1:20:47] but it's because that and Jesus Christ
[1:20:51] is pouring his stuff in cuz he loves you
[1:20:53] and he wants to change you but you see
[1:20:55] there needs to be a shift there needs to
[1:20:58] be a turning around that because the
[1:21:01] soul has been given Dominion the soul
[1:21:05] has and unfortunately some people don't
[1:21:08] recognize their position that they've
[1:21:10] been placed in and it's getting Trampled
[1:21:12] Under The Feminine spirit it's getting
[1:21:14] crushed down by that female your
[1:21:18] spirit and she's ruling that emotional
[1:21:21] part of you the help meat of your life
[1:21:23] is ruling here and the funnel is turned
[1:21:26] upside down and of course it's not
[1:21:28] working because you see uh he that has
[1:21:31] no rule over his own Spirit he the soul
[1:21:36] that has no rule over his own mind and
[1:21:39] spirit and subconscious and conscious is
[1:21:41] like a city that is broken down and
[1:21:44] Without Walls what does that mean this
[1:21:46] house here is breached in its walls and
[1:21:49] the Very Hollywood and fear and Satan's
[1:21:52] evil thought and Fox
[1:21:55] News and negativity from Hollywood and
[1:21:59] all these ideologies that are not from
[1:22:01] above have come in and they're coming
[1:22:04] into that body and that soul and that
[1:22:07] spirit is getting funneled into it and
[1:22:09] it's just it just becomes a cycle now
[1:22:11] it's time to recognize your Dominion
[1:22:14] it's time to recognize that you have
[1:22:15] been placed over those things and to
[1:22:17] take dominion over it you have to if you
[1:22:21] don't you will stay the way you are for
[1:22:23] the rest of your life and you might not
[1:22:25] be
[1:22:26] lost but you've got to recognize that
[1:22:29] worry and fear and all of these negative
[1:22:32] thoughts is making you forget who you
[1:22:34] are and that's what Satan wants to do is
[1:22:37] to forget who's in the boat with
[1:22:39] you and then you get amnesia and you
[1:22:43] live torment because your soul has been
[1:22:47] quickened it has if you've got the Holy
[1:22:50] Ghost but you just don't don't ever get
[1:22:53] past that first part of your land you've
[1:22:55] you cross over Jordan and you're stuck
[1:22:57] and you never conquer Jericho because
[1:22:59] you see you've got to take the minion
[1:23:02] you've got to recognize who you are you
[1:23:04] got to start training those people down
[1:23:06] in the ship by confession by singing
[1:23:09] songs and by actually enjoying the
[1:23:12] things of God and setting your
[1:23:13] affections on things above if your
[1:23:15] affections aren't ask him say Lord
[1:23:18] please help me set my affections on you
[1:23:21] help me you just have to ask if you can
[1:23:24] diagnose your situation ask the antidote
[1:23:27] and he will lead you down a path don't
[1:23:29] just sit there and defeat you can just
[1:23:33] ask unbalanced feelings carnal thoughts
[1:23:37] and then here this is the unbiblical
[1:23:39] Family household and I just put this in
[1:23:42] here just because it's it's the same
[1:23:43] analogy so there you've got a house and
[1:23:46] you got Jesus Christ and then you've got
[1:23:49] this Mo modern feminist spirit in the
[1:23:51] house and the the wife is leading and
[1:23:55] the husband's gone under here but he in
[1:23:59] the house should be up here and if he's
[1:24:03] not here she doesn't go there Jesus
[1:24:06] Christ does not recognize the wife as
[1:24:07] the head of the home if the husband is a
[1:24:10] Christian and and he's meant to be
[1:24:12] leading the home there's obviously
[1:24:14] there's many different circumstances
[1:24:16] there's people without husbands and vice
[1:24:19] versa and you know obviously this is a
[1:24:21] generalization but in a in a in this
[1:24:25] situation that I'm talking about here
[1:24:27] the if the husband isn't here and he
[1:24:29] should be and he's not taking that
[1:24:32] position she cannot just put in here
[1:24:36] what's going to happen is this feminine
[1:24:38] spirit is going to lead and this house
[1:24:40] is going to have a problem because it
[1:24:42] has to be he has to take his position he
[1:24:45] has to be the leader and it's like your
[1:24:47] soul he has to be the leader he or she
[1:24:50] the soul you has to recognize your
[1:24:53] position recognize what God has made you
[1:24:56] confess it sing it act it live it amen
[1:25:00] um musicians
