[7:09] neat when you're at occasion where
[7:10] everyone's happy for the people you know
[7:12] everyone's happy to be there and it's
[7:15] just a beautiful day so um yeah phrase
[7:19] the Lord Lord willing they'll come visit
[7:21] us before they go to Switzerland so it
[7:23] should be which we great I mean let's
[7:26] just go to Deuteronomy chapter 8 and
[7:38] it's got 8 and verse 1 down to verse 8
[7:54] see all the commandments are Deuteronomy
[7:57] 8 and verse 1 all the commandments which
[7:59] I command thee this day shall ye observe
[8:02] to do that you may live and multiply and
[8:05] go in and possess the land which the
[8:06] Lord sware unto your father's that thou
[8:09] shalt remember all the way which the
[8:12] LORD thy God has led the least forty
[8:14] years in the wilderness to Humble thee
[8:16] and to prove thee and to know what is in
[8:18] thine heart whether thou wouldest keep
[8:20] his Commandments or no and he humbled
[8:23] thee and he suffered eater hunger and
[8:24] fiddly with manner which thou knowest
[8:27] not neither did thy fathers know that he
[8:30] might make the know that man does not
[8:34] live by bread only but by every word
[8:37] that proceeds out of the mouth of the
[8:38] Lord doth man live the arraignment wax
[8:41] not old upon thee neither did thy foot
[8:44] swell these 40 years they'll shut also
[8:47] considering thy heart that as a man
[8:49] chase it with his son so the LORD thy
[8:52] God chase nathie therefore thou shalt
[8:55] keep the commandments of the Lord thy
[8:56] God to walk in his ways and to fear him
[8:59] for the LORD thy God bringeth thee into
[9:01] a good land a land of Brooks of water of
[9:03] fountains and dip set spring out of
[9:06] valleys and hills a land of wheat and
[9:08] barley and vines and fig trees and
[9:10] pomegranates a land of olive oil and
[9:13] honey amen may the lord bless us would
[9:16] you may you may have your seats I want
[9:20] to speak I want to speak today about
[9:23] about trials and correction may seem a
[9:28] bit of an odd odd kind of subject but I
[9:30] was just thinking about a watch-night
[9:33] service and I just want to make a few
[9:37] comments about how you know man does God
[9:43] it has different personalities but there
[9:47] is not one personality that God uses
[9:50] above any others so some are like Peter
[9:53] some are like Paul some are like Andrew
[9:55] they're all very different but God does
[9:58] not use a one personality above another
[10:00] and then also how God and in the trials
[10:06] that that people
[10:07] I go through is not necess sometimes
[10:10] it's because the gift of them is great
[10:12] like like brother BAM he went through
[10:14] some great trials because he was the
[10:16] message into the age but sometimes it's
[10:18] a trial other times it's a correction
[10:21] and the scripture says there yo there's
[10:25] no trial that we suffer which is common
[10:27] to man Zevon has trials everyone goes
[10:30] through the same things but sometimes
[10:33] it's God correcting us sometimes it's
[10:35] just a trial but there's a reason all
[10:38] for it so you know she takes so so
[10:40] brother brave season things that are to
[10:42] be he says some mean a real blusterous
[10:45] and some are real dogmatic others are
[10:48] fine others are kind you just find all
[10:51] different kinds of people in his kingdom
[10:53] look at st. Peter and judging by Andrew
[10:56] Andrew as a great prayer warrior stayed
[10:59] on his knees all the time and the
[11:01] Apostle Peter was one of those
[11:02] firebrands that preached and so forth
[11:04] and Paul was more scholarly like more of
[11:08] more of like the prophet or something
[11:10] and sit back see so they're all all
[11:13] different kinds but you see Paul was
[11:16] different to Peter and Peter was
[11:19] different to Andrew but they all had
[11:20] their place in the body so they didn't
[11:23] hit they didn't just have all one kind
[11:24] of personality and so our trials and so
[11:30] many times that you know trials can be
[11:33] or correction can be depending upon us
[11:39] and if we're willing to take the easy
[11:42] way yo yo just like children you know
[11:45] the more they don't listen the more
[11:48] you've got to apply the pressure on them
[11:50] to change their ways a little bit
[11:52] because chastisement which is actually
[11:54] correction is because you have their
[11:55] best interest in mind it's not just to
[11:58] be mean and and you know make their life
[12:01] real rigid and all these things but it's
[12:03] too it's to set them in a certain
[12:05] direction and the more yield that they
[12:09] could say you could say they are or the
[12:11] more yielded we are to the to the will
[12:13] of God then the easier things get when
[12:16] it comes to correction but we can still
[12:19] have very hard trials
[12:21] but so this I just want to make that
[12:23] differentiation is a difference between
[12:24] a trial as in a trial and a trial as in
[12:28] the Lord correcting you now I want to
[12:38] let's go down to 0 it's just a Hindu
[12:41] tirana me act which get a bit of a study
[12:43] today but you see it says in the
[12:48] scripture that God led Israel out of
[12:52] Egypt as it says out of Egypt have I
[12:55] called my son so this was now God as a
[12:58] people he was calling Israel his son or
[13:01] his child and now he had a he had a
[13:04] place in mind for his son and that was
[13:07] have dominion over his inheritance and
[13:10] so God had to mold and shape his son in
[13:13] order to possess that inheritance and
[13:15] it's the same thing with us you know the
[13:17] scripture tells us we are we are
[13:19] predestinated unto the adoption of sons
[13:22] and that word adoption of sons and the
[13:24] Greek means the placing of the song it
[13:27] doesn't mean that I go to another
[13:29] country and I find a child that's not my
[13:32] blood relative and then I take them into
[13:34] my family I signed some paperwork saying
[13:36] legally though now my son that is not
[13:38] viable adoption Bible adoption as a son
[13:41] and a son is the same as a daughter is
[13:43] birthed into the family and then the
[13:45] father faces that child under tutorship
[13:48] until finally that child comes to a
[13:51] place of maturity where the Sun or the
[13:53] daughter I put it that way acts exactly
[13:55] like the father and then the father
[13:57] places publicly gives a public
[13:59] declaration in a ceremony that this
[14:01] child is that there there would as good
[14:04] as my word and actually gives the son or
[14:06] daughter dominion of everything the
[14:09] father has so it's placing the it's
[14:11] placing the child into the family okay
[14:16] so so here in Deuteronomy 8 we see that
[14:18] the reason God was taking Israel and
[14:23] through the wilderness and the way he
[14:25] did is because he was wanting them not
[14:27] to lean upon their own ability he was he
[14:30] was wanting them not to lean upon what
[14:33] they could do because
[14:34] remember all they knew so okay so then
[14:37] you have to be slaves in Egypt but they
[14:39] knew how to grow crops then you had to
[14:41] provide in a certain fashion for their
[14:44] children and for their family they knew
[14:45] how to do those things but God was going
[14:47] to take them on a journey where it was
[14:49] really going to turn all that on its
[14:50] head where they had to come to
[14:53] understand and to know that it was
[14:56] actually God providing for them that
[14:58] through every trial in the wilderness
[14:59] God gave a way of provisional way of
[15:02] escape that they could not trust in
[15:04] their own self and their own ability but
[15:07] they would lean upon the father and this
[15:12] is very important because you know even
[15:14] it says here you know we read there how
[15:16] they you know how he humbled the verse 3
[15:20] and suffered lead a hunger to feed the
[15:22] with manner which thou knewest not
[15:24] neither did thy father's know so they so
[15:28] they were experiencing things wasn't
[15:29] just the miracles but they are
[15:31] experiencing things their fathers knew
[15:33] nothing about then you one day the
[15:35] promise was going to come but now they
[15:36] are living at the promise so they were
[15:38] they were living a way of life that was
[15:41] very different to their previous
[15:42] generations of of Israel and God was
[15:45] doing this because he was trying to
[15:47] teach them correct their ways that when
[15:49] they come into the land they wouldn't
[15:51] turn out to be like the Egyptians or the
[15:53] other nations they wouldn't lean upon
[15:55] their own understanding of their own
[15:57] ability but they would they would have a
[16:00] rest and an assurance that if God had
[16:03] brought them to such a place thank God
[16:05] would look after them it's the same
[16:06] thing with us you know we our lives when
[16:10] God came your way you look at your
[16:13] parents and your or your grandparents
[16:15] your your forebears and I'm not talking
[16:17] about the kind of society they lived in
[16:19] but what did they do maybe that you know
[16:21] maybe go to church have some religious
[16:23] thing they'd work they had their family
[16:26] you know God would deal in a certain way
[16:28] but now comes into a different kind of
[16:30] season a totally different kind of
[16:32] season where God doesn't want us to lean
[16:35] upon maybe the thinking of our forebears
[16:39] even though there's a lot of good in it
[16:41] but he wants us to walk in a way that
[16:44] they know nothing off because it wasn't
[16:47] their season
[16:48] whatever God that in their season doddle
[16:50] you know doesn't mean they're lost i'm
[16:52] not saying that in any way but now God
[16:54] brings us into a different season and
[16:55] brings a generation into a different way
[16:58] and he does that so we have to as as
[17:05] believers we have to walk in a certain
[17:09] way believe in God in a certain way that
[17:11] is different to maybe what we've done in
[17:13] the past we do because he's wanting to
[17:19] see now now when no this is my thinking
[17:24] but when God says says that he brought
[17:27] them into the wilderness and led them 40
[17:29] years they're too humble the in to prove
[17:31] thee and to know what was in thine heart
[17:33] I don't think he was he was doing it in
[17:36] a way just to show all the bed he wasn't
[17:40] looking for the bed he was looking he
[17:42] was really wanting to prove to them what
[17:44] was in them this is just my thinking
[17:47] because he because God he doesn't he
[17:49] doesn't crush people sometimes he does
[17:53] but he doesn't just leave them crushed
[17:54] but he rebuilds them and he had to take
[17:56] them into the wilderness because he had
[17:58] to rebuild Israel because you know why
[18:02] did one generation say we can't take the
[18:04] land the other generation there was no
[18:05] question you know they didn't have a big
[18:08] public meeting in then and in the spice
[18:10] you know the two spies give their report
[18:12] after they came out of Jericho they just
[18:14] followed they said as you're with Moses
[18:16] as God wills as Moses Joshua sighs with
[18:18] you you know there was no dispute they
[18:20] just they were just in harmony they were
[18:22] under expectation they are full of faith
[18:24] they were yo it had been bad been proved
[18:28] you know God was God was really
[18:31] revealing to them what was in them
[18:33] that's the same thing with us we don't
[18:35] really know what's within us we look
[18:37] within and I was thinking this morning
[18:38] you know you know you can look within
[18:40] yourself and all you can see is mainly
[18:43] maybe you know you're the failures of
[18:46] your character you know your pain or
[18:49] hurt or whatever you may be carrying or
[18:51] bad memories or your limitations but God
[18:56] doesn't want us he doesn't want us to
[18:58] look at those things you know he doesn't
[19:00] want us just to
[19:02] that's not to prove what's within thee
[19:03] because that's not the thing that God is
[19:06] leaning upon or trusting him he's
[19:08] wanting to prove to you that your faith
[19:11] is real that your faith has work and it
[19:14] is working and you have a full
[19:15] confidence and assurance you know you
[19:18] have to really look at and say God you
[19:20] called me in spite of me you saved me in
[19:23] spite of me you sanctified me in spite
[19:26] of me you transformed me in spite of me
[19:29] you're walking with me this great holy
[19:31] God that they couldn't even approach in
[19:33] the Old Testament they had to set
[19:35] boundaries around Mount Sinai they
[19:37] couldn't go near where Moses went up and
[19:39] Yong Yong to the Prince of God only the
[19:41] high priest should go into the holy of
[19:43] holies once a year with the blood they
[19:46] are all you know if we were there we
[19:48] would be in the outer court they see the
[19:50] priests Cohen that come out you know
[19:52] into the inner court then you see the
[19:54] high priest going we couldn't go in
[19:55] maybe see the pillar of fire come down
[19:57] on the tap on the tent I don't know but
[20:00] we couldn't go into his presence and
[20:03] even even you know God judge sends so
[20:07] severely it's like leprosy is a type of
[20:10] sin he said anyone that's got leprosy
[20:12] has to be thrust without the camp they
[20:14] couldn't even be in the camp that's how
[20:16] much God you know views views sin but
[20:20] yet he found us and by the blood of
[20:22] Jesus Christ he cleansed us a mint and
[20:26] and it's not and even in our failures in
[20:30] our fluster a shins and what we can see
[20:34] will think ourselves to be he still
[20:36] walks with us he doesn't get sick of us
[20:39] he doesn't you know many times I her
[20:41] brother on Spencer say this he says yeah
[20:43] many times he he thinks God just going
[20:45] to throw them in the rubbish bin and
[20:46] just walk on I'm sick if you you know
[20:49] but God doesn't get that way even if we
[20:51] may get sick of ourselves God doesn't
[20:53] get sick of us because we are his
[20:56] children his children are going to make
[20:59] it his children cannot be lost you know
[21:03] people say how could a loving God send
[21:05] his children to you know to be destroyed
[21:07] in a lake of fire he's not sending any
[21:09] of his children they're not one of them
[21:11] are going to end up in that place and so
[21:14] he's not
[21:15] he's not going to you know he's not
[21:19] going to let you go but that doesn't
[21:22] mean the road isn't rocky yeah because
[21:24] he has you know he's a father and he's
[21:27] not maybe a lazy father or indifferent
[21:29] father he's a very focused loving father
[21:34] I'm so glad that's true so he's wanting
[21:38] and Israel that's what Israel they went
[21:40] through the Red Sea you know they had
[21:41] all those things happen to them because
[21:43] they really needed to sit back and say
[21:45] God brought us out of Egypt that's why
[21:48] they are told tell these things to your
[21:49] children and to your children's children
[21:51] keep the testimonial life because they
[21:54] had to tell them God did this for us God
[21:58] even told us these are mightier nations
[22:00] that they're stronger nations in the
[22:02] land but it's not you you have to go
[22:04] fight but but the Lord will fight the
[22:06] battle God gave us Jericho we didn't
[22:08] have the equipment to do it God brought
[22:10] the walls down God open the entrance
[22:11] into the land God open the word to us I
[22:14] think God gave us you know let our
[22:17] places of of your cities of refuge God
[22:19] placed them there amen owl city of
[22:23] refuge is Jesus Christ hallelujah you
[22:27] know yours reading and you know I was
[22:28] reading Deuteronomy I was just enjoying
[22:29] it yo there's the you know the law of
[22:31] the kinsman redeemer it is a gesture
[22:34] edema you're near family member that's
[22:37] fallen into debt but part of the kismet
[22:40] Redeemers role is to be the Avenger of
[22:43] blood now what that is now is that just
[22:46] say if I mistake well just our win and
[22:48] murdered someone but I was trying to say
[22:51] it was an accident I could run into a
[22:53] city of refuge and I could profess
[22:56] dollars an action because of us an
[22:57] accident you kill someone it comes
[22:59] before the court and you can get off you
[23:01] get off as an accident but if you
[23:02] willfully kill someone then run to the
[23:05] City of Refuge the Avenger of blood
[23:07] who's the near kinsman has the has the
[23:10] privilege to go take that person and and
[23:14] revenge the death of their family member
[23:17] upon that one and take his life we have
[23:20] a kinsman we have a kinsman that didn't
[23:24] just redeem us out of out of slavery and
[23:26] bondage
[23:27] he has thee he has the privilege now to
[23:30] exact all the judgment that we should
[23:31] have received has now gone on the head
[23:34] of our accuser amen and now now our Lord
[23:37] Jesus is the Avenger of blood hallelujah
[23:40] that he's going to now drag Satan he's
[23:43] going to throw them into a lake of fire
[23:44] and to me I don't think there's going to
[23:46] be much ceremonial time he's just going
[23:48] to throw them and I may not know I was
[23:50] thing to myself I'd love to see him
[23:52] going but do I want to waste my time has
[23:55] he gone he's gone good praise the Lord
[23:56] let's move on I'm not going to give him
[23:59] that you know you know what I mean you
[24:00] don't want to drag it up just it's just
[24:01] get rid of this guy I'm done Alleluia so
[24:05] we have an Avenger of blood amen and
[24:08] he's our kinsman now so they they they
[24:12] had to God was proving them and he was
[24:17] hump and any humbled them that they
[24:20] could understand what they would know in
[24:22] their hearts not mentally known their
[24:23] hearts God brought us this way God place
[24:26] us in the land God did all these things
[24:28] for us but it was their faith sees what
[24:32] he who you know God told them you're
[24:34] you're a special nation of people you're
[24:37] my you're my holy nation your royal
[24:39] nation and he wanted them to to
[24:43] recognize that not in a proud way but in
[24:46] a humble way there no doubt would have
[24:49] been other slaves in Egypt there would
[24:51] have been Ethiopian slaves there would
[24:53] have been all different kind of nation
[24:54] slaves in Egypt maybe not at the size of
[24:58] the Hebrews you know in terms of
[25:00] population but there would have been
[25:01] other slaves why didn't God deliver them
[25:04] because he delivered Israel because they
[25:06] were the ones that he wanted to place in
[25:07] the promised land and it's like us you
[25:10] say well this world is very dark it is
[25:12] but I'm glad he found me I'm glad he
[25:14] saved me there are billions of people
[25:16] upon the earth the day I got saved by a
[25:19] Yeti you know he saved me and he had a
[25:21] purpose it's like he saved you he got
[25:23] ahold of you because he's a P as a
[25:24] purpose in mind Amen because he saw he
[25:28] saw a part of himself in you hallelujah
[25:32] no
[25:36] this word chastise earth here in
[25:39] Deuteronomy reread chastise it means
[25:43] literally with blows or figuratively
[25:46] with words as to instruct us to correct
[25:49] to instruct to punish to reform so God
[25:56] has a God has a certain way he wants you
[25:59] to go and he will and we'll go into the
[26:03] new test me sir every Sun that comes to
[26:05] God must be chastised must be corrected
[26:09] and it says he scourges every son that
[26:12] comes to him so I went on Google looked
[26:15] at scourging I looked at Jesus and the
[26:16] you know it's not a little there you go
[26:22] that's ask you lose a bit of skin a lot
[26:26] of skin you get flailed but this is what
[26:31] God you know I remember when I was with
[26:33] the Lord start dealing with me and then
[26:35] he still does feels like he just rips my
[26:37] height off me but it's always for my
[26:39] good amen praise God because He loves us
[26:44] is that may sound pretty strange but
[26:47] it's like if my girls ran out on the
[26:51] road I wouldn't just call out you know
[26:54] do you want to come back and you know
[26:56] I'd grab them I gang them up I'd throw
[26:58] them inside you know I would make them
[27:01] remember that day because I don't want
[27:03] them getting killed but if I didn't
[27:07] really love them I let them go on the
[27:09] road oh there's one gone oh well see
[27:11] you're such a nice girl I really loved
[27:13] it no I didn't if I really love drug
[27:16] would have got her out of harm's way now
[27:22] the word humbled it's having or showing
[27:27] a modest or low estimate of one's
[27:29] importance that doesn't mean if you you
[27:33] have low self-esteem or low but to me to
[27:39] be humble is to have low estimate of
[27:43] one's importance compared to God or
[27:45] compared to other people I mean where
[27:49] you make
[27:50] where where your heart is you are the
[27:52] servant and their greater than you
[27:54] remember a great person makes other
[27:56] people feel great amen now this is just
[28:02] in the message of grace I like I was
[28:04] searching a humble heart he says but it
[28:07] takes the simplicity of believing God to
[28:10] make his word speak out to show that
[28:12] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[28:14] and forever takes a humbled heart
[28:17] dedicated to God bring Jesus Christ unto
[28:20] present tense I mean if it had taken
[28:23] theology then it would then it would
[28:25] then what would the Presbyterian
[28:29] Methodist Baptist Catholic and so forth
[28:31] we wouldn't have a chance us poor
[28:33] unlearned people but it doesn't take
[28:35] knowledge not by power by might but by
[28:37] my spirit saith God I'll unfold this
[28:41] mystery and he'll try to grace grace
[28:43] with shoutings and crying's that's what
[28:45] it is today God's amazing grace to his
[28:47] people how he takes the illiterate the
[28:49] unlearned and shows that Jesus is the
[28:51] same Alleluia so it takes a humbled
[28:56] heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus
[28:58] Christ into the present tense and that's
[29:01] exactly with all our hearts that's what
[29:04] we want to do now let's go to first
[29:06] Peter 1 and 7
[29:27] now
[29:35] first Peter one and seven I know this is
[29:37] all we'll go from verse 6 wherein you
[29:46] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[29:49] if need be yea in heaviness through
[29:51] manifold temptations that the trial of
[29:55] your faith being much more precious than
[29:57] of gold that perisheth that be tried
[30:00] with fire might be found under praise
[30:02] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[30:05] Jesus Christ whom having not seen you
[30:11] love and whom though you now see him not
[30:13] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[30:16] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[30:19] the end of your faith even the salvation
[30:22] of your souls so he says the trial of
[30:27] your faith there's much more precious
[30:30] than of gold that perishes thought be
[30:31] tried with fire so there are trials
[30:35] which try our faith I'm just going to
[30:38] cover these things kind of briefly there
[30:40] are trials that try our faith because
[30:44] God is willing to prove your faith that
[30:46] it works that what you've what you've
[30:48] received in your heart is not in your
[30:50] head because it was just in your head
[30:52] when trials come you know it won't hold
[30:56] you but when it becomes a living
[30:58] revelation in your heart then it will be
[31:01] tried but then you'll you know God knows
[31:03] how important revelation is God knows
[31:06] the value of who of him imparting his
[31:09] word to assault he knows the value of
[31:12] that but we really but us your infinite
[31:15] of a finite rather human beings we need
[31:18] to learn the value of it we need to
[31:21] actually end with God you don't learn up
[31:24] here you learn by doing you learn by
[31:26] experience and so God has to show you yo
[31:31] how great your faith is because it's
[31:35] when your faith has tried you could look
[31:37] back at that trial and say I'm still on
[31:39] my feet I'm still praising God and you
[31:43] may not be you may be like job on the
[31:45] ash heap he didn't understand what was
[31:47] going on but he was still
[31:49] you know he did complain about it but he
[31:51] was still standing he lost everything
[31:54] but he was still standing but his faith
[31:57] was being tried and it's like us you say
[32:01] well that's blind faith faith is blind
[32:05] sometimes faith is blind we have the
[32:08] assurance of a rapture so we have the
[32:12] assurance of a body change we have the
[32:14] assurance that we're going to crown him
[32:16] king of kings and Lord of lords we have
[32:18] the assurance that that we're going to
[32:20] be on this earth for a thousand years in
[32:21] the millennium and the devil's going to
[32:23] be bound we have the assurance that
[32:25] we're going to rule or reign with Christ
[32:27] we have the assurance that we're not
[32:29] coming to the great white throne
[32:30] judgment to be judged but we're there
[32:32] with the judge judging the world and the
[32:34] angels we have that assurance we have
[32:37] the assurance that you know that we are
[32:40] literally going to walk within the New
[32:42] Jerusalem and we're going to see it come
[32:45] down upon the earth and we're going to
[32:46] walk in the gates lift the upper gates
[32:48] and be lifted up that the King of glory
[32:50] may come and we have the assurance of
[32:52] those things we have the assurance that
[32:54] if we all have cardiac arrest right now
[32:57] and die that will be in glory we have
[33:01] the assurance that God will take us
[33:02] there it's not anything that we all have
[33:04] we done everything just right have
[33:06] you've committed your life to him he'll
[33:08] take you there so we know those things
[33:11] and it's in here that we know those
[33:13] things we know that Jesus has he's come
[33:16] to prepare a bride and however we found
[33:19] grace on the site we may never really
[33:21] fathom it but we know that we're one of
[33:23] those number their blood wash number we
[33:26] know those things and we know he's
[33:28] preparing us for the wedding supper of
[33:29] the Lamb we know those things so our
[33:34] faith in those regards is not blind
[33:37] because we see it that's in here we see
[33:39] it we know it amen more than just
[33:41] reading Scripture and all that sounds
[33:43] lovely but something in us identifies
[33:45] that's us that's you that's me but
[33:49] there's sometimes in life will we don't
[33:51] know Lord where are you taking me and we
[33:54] may go through it though I walk through
[33:55] the valley of the shadow of death I fear
[33:56] no evil you know we know as long as we
[33:59] know he's leading us that's the main
[34:02] thing
[34:02] but sometimes you're walking and you say
[34:06] Lord what's going on and there's no
[34:08] answer that's when your faith is being
[34:10] tried that's when it's being tried
[34:12] because if we had you know even even
[34:15] brother Bram said he doesn't need
[34:18] because he receives he received so many
[34:21] thousands of visions he saw the vision
[34:23] he knew was going to happen he said you
[34:25] need more faith than me because we don't
[34:28] have many of us at newest envisions you
[34:31] know we don't know what tomorrow holds
[34:32] but if you saw a vision you want help
[34:34] tomorrow you wouldn't really need to
[34:35] have faith the whole dogs you knew what
[34:37] happened such we're now so many times we
[34:43] have to walk by faith that we do not
[34:46] know the outcome and that's when your
[34:50] faith astride praise God because he's
[34:55] wanting to he's wanting to show what you
[34:57] because remember faith is a revelation
[34:59] that's nothing you conjure up as nothing
[35:02] you really possess unless it's given to
[35:05] you you can't make it just like you
[35:08] can't make someone else believe without
[35:09] God come and go and confirming it to
[35:11] that person even though you may lay it
[35:13] out logically and it all make make sense
[35:15] and all those things without God giving
[35:17] them faith to believe it then it may you
[35:19] know then it will never happen and it's
[35:21] like us we didn't give ourselves faith
[35:23] they say well I prayed and I sought God
[35:26] and all these things happen the
[35:27] scripture says there's not one that
[35:29] seeks after him in Romans there's not
[35:31] one that seeks after God it is God
[35:33] having to put that within you and that's
[35:36] why we have to cry in the hunger because
[35:37] he put it in us so and if God has done
[35:44] that for us he doesn't just give it to
[35:47] you just say he'd go and then pull it
[35:50] away you know he doesn't do it that way
[35:52] he has your interest in mind he's
[35:55] interested mine now let's go to James
[36:00] one and one
[36:12] so James honor one James a servant of
[36:14] God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the
[36:16] twelve tribes which are scattered abroad
[36:18] greeting my brethren cannon all joy when
[36:22] you fall into divers temptations
[36:24] knowingness the trying of your faith
[36:26] worketh patience but let patience have a
[36:29] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[36:32] entire wanting nothing if any of you
[36:36] lack wisdom let him ask of God that he
[36:39] that he giveth to all men liberally and
[36:41] uh praedyth not and it shall be given to
[36:44] him but let him ask in faith nothing
[36:46] wavering he that wave earth is like a
[36:48] wave of the sea driven with the wounds
[36:51] and tossed now a braid a--the it means
[36:55] to defame that is to rail to chide or to
[36:57] taunt and you know so it's saying you
[37:05] know he he doesn't upgrade as and he
[37:09] doesn't do that to you when you asked
[37:11] for wisdom he gives it liberally but
[37:14] notice James's go straight and count it
[37:15] all joy because when you fall into
[37:18] diverse or many temptations because it's
[37:21] the trying because it's the knowingness
[37:23] that the trying of your faith worketh
[37:25] patience so when you fall into diverse
[37:27] temptation it's actually working
[37:29] patience your faith worketh patience and
[37:31] even jesus said have you not considered
[37:33] the patience of jobe he was in his great
[37:37] trial but it was as great patience I
[37:39] mean but he didn't know God would answer
[37:41] him he didn't know he didn't know God
[37:45] comes down in a whirlwind and speaks he
[37:47] didn't know those things he just had
[37:50] questions and he pondered things and he
[37:51] was asking you know and he's talking to
[37:54] his friends about you know I know the
[37:55] tree and the seasons and nature goes
[37:58] round like the death burial resurrection
[38:00] but what about man what happens to me I
[38:03] don't know you know and but his patients
[38:08] held out that I think somehow doubting
[38:11] himself in you that maybe one day he'd
[38:13] get the answer maybe he didn't know it'd
[38:15] be then but if God came upon the scene
[38:17] and gave him the answer but it was great
[38:19] patience it was as patients where he
[38:22] could stand there in his condition and
[38:25] I still even though he slay me you don't
[38:27] trust of the Lord gives the Lord takes
[38:29] away blessed be his name and this was a
[38:33] man without the Holy Ghost that side of
[38:37] it's meant to be the oldest book of the
[38:39] Bible so I don't think they even had the
[38:41] law in those days of Moses and all those
[38:42] things you know all he had was the shed
[38:45] blood of the Lamb that's all he had all
[38:47] he knew was God requires a sacrifice and
[38:50] that's all he that was his Bible that's
[38:53] all he had he knew how the stars were
[38:54] and everything but that's all he really
[38:56] knew and yet he could stand there with
[38:59] his great patience and here we are but
[39:04] you have to but why is it so those those
[39:07] stories are the place in the Bible not
[39:09] to make us feel little necessarily if
[39:11] that makes me feel little but is to
[39:13] encourage you if this man can stand with
[39:15] the faith with the revelation he had how
[39:17] much more the bride of Jesus Christ
[39:19] where the whole word is open we were not
[39:21] under the blood of bulls of growth
[39:23] brother under the blood of Jesus Christ
[39:24] with a very god that came and spake how
[39:26] the world wonder job comes and dwells
[39:28] and his children hallelujah it's meant
[39:30] to I trusted encourages you may say Lord
[39:33] I can never amount to that but you have
[39:35] to remember the same faith that was in
[39:37] jovah's in the believer amen you've
[39:40] gotta tap you've got a rest and what you
[39:42] have how's this going to turn out I
[39:45] don't know but I know who's going to
[39:48] make it work out for my good all things
[39:51] romans 8 28 all things he says for we
[39:54] know this is ball now he didn't have a
[39:57] flowery bed of east he didn't set up in
[39:59] jerusalem and write letters and send the
[40:00] mountain that was it he he endured a lot
[40:03] of things he said before we know all
[40:06] things all ALL work for our good those
[40:11] that love God and are called according
[40:12] to his purpose and I trust you can say I
[40:17] fit that category yeah you know I
[40:20] trusted something he says that's me so
[40:22] that means all things work for my good
[40:23] well we may never know our police it as
[40:27] before but we may never know you know
[40:29] you take one event well how did that
[40:31] work for my good I had a lot of pain and
[40:33] scars and hurt from that thing but
[40:36] God has an Ingo and so heal heal heal
[40:40] use that event as part of what he wants
[40:43] to get out of you in the future because
[40:45] he knows that it'll work for your good
[40:47] you may not understand there's a lot of
[40:49] things in life though well why did I
[40:51] have to go through that it was for my
[40:53] good amen and we just have to rest in
[40:58] there one day we may know but it's
[41:01] interesting you know we live in this day
[41:03] and age of instant answers so many times
[41:06] you sit around talk with people and
[41:08] someone says something and so I want to
[41:10] see I was that right you go and welcome
[41:11] what do you say mr. Wikipedia mr. Google
[41:14] and yeah that is right you know you
[41:16] continue no I yeah I trust you've
[41:20] experienced that if you don't but you
[41:22] know but but here's now here's now God
[41:25] and just imagine that that you're the
[41:27] Apostle John and I I think he would have
[41:30] written down afters majan he was
[41:32] actually there and writing basically in
[41:34] real time what Jesus was doing and then
[41:37] so they asked him when he going to
[41:40] restore the kingdom Jesus says it's not
[41:42] for you to know Johnny said it's not for
[41:45] you to know it's not for you to know you
[41:49] know he's actually a you know he's
[41:51] riding down the it's actually not for me
[41:53] to know you know and why am I saying
[41:58] that sometimes we want the answer
[41:59] instantly but sometimes God actually
[42:02] says no it's not for you to know yet
[42:03] he's got to walk with me God's timing is
[42:08] always different to our timing now first
[42:12] Corinthians 10 and 12 it's just it let's
[42:16] just read this
[42:33] first Corinthians 10 and 12
[42:39] it is wherefore let him that thinketh he
[42:45] standeth take heed lest he fall there
[42:48] hath no temptation taken you but such is
[42:50] common to men but God is faithful who
[42:55] will not suffer you to be I'd be tempted
[42:57] above that you're able but with the
[42:59] temptation also make a way of escape
[43:01] that you may be able to bear it so you
[43:05] sing there's no temptation that you know
[43:09] there's no trial there's no hardship
[43:10] that we injure that's common to men so
[43:13] people in the world suffer the same
[43:16] things that believer suffers they go
[43:18] through the same hardships we go through
[43:21] but God now maybe one day down the road
[43:25] God will get ahold of those people but
[43:28] with the with the believer God has an
[43:32] engl member he wants us to come forth as
[43:35] gold he wants to mold and shape our
[43:38] character and correct us a certain way
[43:39] that would go in a certain direction and
[43:41] so people just go yo this life is full
[43:46] of trolls everyone goes through trials
[43:48] believer make-believe or unbeliever
[43:50] whatever but the believer goes through
[43:55] these things because he wants us to
[44:01] understand that is not as it's not how
[44:05] we should do things or how we do things
[44:07] it's how he does things and he wants to
[44:09] mold and shape us in a certain way so we
[44:15] go through all kinds of things and even
[44:18] Peter in first Peter 4 and 12 beloved
[44:20] think you're not strange concerning the
[44:21] fiery trial which is to try you as
[44:23] though some strange thing happened unto
[44:26] you but rejoice and as much as your
[44:28] partakers of Christ's sufferings that
[44:30] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[44:34] be glad also with exceeding joy so she
[44:37] just think you're not strange why this
[44:39] happened think are not strange these
[44:42] things just happen but God has an end
[44:45] goal for you and so he uses these things
[44:48] because he wants to mold and shape us he
[44:51] was to place us in our position he
[44:53] wants to adopt us and then even after
[44:55] the adoption the trials can still come
[45:00] you take David David had to be adopted
[45:04] as King placed his King and God proved
[45:09] you have proof does faith you know he
[45:11] anointed him by the Prophet he killed
[45:13] the line in the berry Kilkelly you know
[45:15] but had to go through a lot of hard
[45:17] spots in his life and through those hard
[45:20] spots we've got the book of psalms so
[45:24] God was mauling in check you know God
[45:26] put him in a pressure cooker not to not
[45:29] for David to be expressed but for Christ
[45:31] to be expressed for God to be expressed
[45:33] out of his life and then finally David
[45:36] comes to be king he's now on his place
[45:39] as king but then now the trials are
[45:43] still there you know sometimes you know
[45:46] people in the past of thought you get
[45:48] the Holy Ghost life's a flower bit of
[45:51] east know that no that's when the battle
[45:52] starts that's when there's real victory
[45:55] to be had that's when the real testing
[45:57] comes and so David's on the throne well
[46:00] what happens up that is Bathsheba
[46:02] there's absalon you know Satan tempts
[46:05] any numbers the people all those things
[46:08] happen but he's still king he's still
[46:12] king as the same thing with us we may we
[46:16] may fail in those kind of ways but
[46:19] doesn't make us not a son but because
[46:21] but because remember because what he did
[46:24] with Bathsheba the Prophet said the
[46:27] sword will not depart out of your house
[46:29] that's why epsilon read up and all those
[46:31] different things so we reap what we sow
[46:36] that law always applies to everyone it
[46:40] always applies to everyone and so God
[46:44] doesn't just you know God forgiveness of
[46:47] what we do but we still have to reap
[46:49] what we've sold yeah God forgives us God
[46:54] forgave David but he still reap what he
[46:57] sold and it's the same thing with us
[47:01] because we have the blood we're forgiven
[47:06] but we still reap what we sow sometimes
[47:09] God may just take it all out of the way
[47:11] and make it better but sometimes though
[47:12] you actually have to learn from this
[47:16] praise the Lord not saying that as a
[47:19] joke because he wants us to learn amen
[47:23] now this is in the faith of Abraham in
[47:26] 55 jacent did you ever have any of it
[47:30] child training bringing you up giving
[47:32] you a little proto plasma stimulation
[47:35] once in a while by the gospel making a
[47:37] correction my daddy was awful good at it
[47:39] yes so he believed in the golden rule it
[47:41] laid up over the door all the Ten
[47:44] Commandments out on a Hickory stick
[47:45] about that long brush on the end of it I
[47:47] tell you that made discipline in the
[47:50] brand him home but we love him what
[47:52] would we have been if we if he hadn't
[47:55] done it that's the way god is he brings
[47:58] discipline to his children trying them
[48:00] whipping them when they're wrong I'm
[48:02] happy that our Heavenly Father gives us
[48:04] whippings to those who are wrong and
[48:07] corrects me when I'm wrong Disney
[48:08] whippings makes me straighten up walk
[48:11] like you should walk as he told Abraham
[48:14] he's truck he's going to try him or give
[48:17] him trials and every Christian every
[48:19] Christian has to be tried Peter said
[48:22] think it not strange beloved when fiery
[48:24] trials come upon you for it's only done
[48:26] to prove your faith that that's more
[48:30] precious to you than gold we say this is
[48:38] not the greatest of subjects the reason
[48:41] you say well why do i keep getting
[48:43] corrected because god loves you he
[48:45] doesn't just let you go and you should
[48:48] value it amen you should value value
[48:53] because he because he's very interested
[48:55] in you you know then just let you wander
[48:58] off and they always he gone and go where
[49:00] she got and go get them back now he's
[49:01] very interested in you and he's hovering
[49:03] over you like a hint does her brew
[49:06] hallelujah now let's go to Hebrews
[49:09] chapter 12
[49:13] I thought I just read all these because
[49:23] ultimately you know we want to we want
[49:33] to stay balanced well I do and God's
[49:37] Word is always balanced it says and have
[49:45] you forgotten the exhortation which
[49:48] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[49:50] son despise not thou the chastening of
[49:53] the Lord nor faint we're now at rebuked
[49:56] of him for whom the Lord loveth he
[49:58] chastises now this word chest either as
[50:02] two turrets that is education or
[50:04] training so it's not just it's not just
[50:07] it's not just you could say it's not
[50:10] just getting a box law for the sake of
[50:12] it okay but but God has your he has your
[50:17] training your best interest in mind and
[50:19] God wants to train or teach you through
[50:23] trials that's what he wants to do so
[50:26] he's actually and and his tailor-made
[50:28] our lives and he allows trials to come
[50:31] in your way because he could basically
[50:33] say now here's lesson number 75 but we
[50:38] may not know exactly you know normally
[50:39] when you go to a lesson the teacher says
[50:41] this is the outline of what I'm going to
[50:42] teach you today and then they then the
[50:44] lesson begins and then you get the
[50:46] homework you know and you do it you know
[50:48] but God now he brings you into a trial
[50:51] and this is always stuck with me with
[50:53] what brother Tim Dodds hit at our camp
[50:54] he said you know you know when his first
[50:57] wife just died very unexpectedly they
[50:59] did a full autopsy didn't find anything
[51:01] wrong with her he said lord help me to
[51:04] look around in this trial because I may
[51:07] never walk this way again so he was he
[51:10] was really wanting to receive the full
[51:12] impact of what God was trying to teach
[51:14] him in that moment and I think that's an
[51:19] incredible that's an incredible
[51:21] statement that he made because he's
[51:23] wanting to every situation is one to
[51:25] teach us through it could be
[51:27] small thing could be a very great life
[51:29] changing thing but he wanting he's
[51:31] wanting to tutor us or show us through
[51:34] the thing so it's not just I you've done
[51:37] wrong you've done wrong you've done
[51:38] wrong it's not that at all is like now
[51:40] I'm going to teach you why that's why
[51:42] God that's why God brought the children
[51:43] of Israel oh we're thirsty well i'm
[51:47] going to show you that i am the god that
[51:48] provides water you know are now we're
[51:51] hungry i'll send you food you've never
[51:53] had before to show that i'm going to
[51:55] look after even at a desert I'll look
[51:57] after you he was teaching them he was
[52:00] tutoring them now I brought you out I'm
[52:03] going to look after you I'm going to
[52:04] place you in the land every step of the
[52:06] journey I am right there nor faint
[52:11] without rebuked of him for whom the Lord
[52:13] loveth he chastises and scourges every
[52:15] son whom he receiveth if you endure
[52:18] chase inning God deals with you as with
[52:21] sons for what son is he whom the father
[52:25] chasing earth not but if you be without
[52:28] chastisement where of all our potaters
[52:31] then you are bastards not sons
[52:33] furthermore we have had our fathers of
[52:36] our flesh which corrected us and we gave
[52:38] them reverence shall we not much rather
[52:41] be in subjection unto the father of
[52:43] spirits and live for very for a few days
[52:46] chasing us after their own pleasure but
[52:49] he for our profit that we might be
[52:52] partakers of his holiness now no
[52:55] chastising for the present seemeth to be
[52:58] joyous but grievous nevertheless
[53:00] afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit
[53:03] of righteousness unto them which are
[53:06] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[53:10] hands which handgun in the feeble needs
[53:11] and make straight paths for your feet
[53:13] lease that which is lame be turned out
[53:16] of the way but let it rather be healed
[53:19] follow peace with all men and holiness
[53:22] without which no man shall see the Lord
[53:25] looking diligently least any man for
[53:27] fail of the grace of God least any root
[53:30] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[53:31] if I whereby many be defiled so if we
[53:38] endure che sitting
[53:40] we take the correction he deals with us
[53:42] as sons as I said God deals with us as
[53:48] sons and if he's dealing with us his
[53:51] sons which he is now a son is a position
[53:54] that's why can say son or daughter it's
[53:56] a position so if he deals with us a sons
[54:01] then he wants to place us in the fact he
[54:04] wants to place us in the family that our
[54:08] word is as good as God's Word because
[54:11] the father when the when the Sun came to
[54:15] a certain maturity or he was acting and
[54:17] conducting himself the same way as the
[54:19] father that then the tutor said now he's
[54:21] ready and I see the beginning and then
[54:24] they had a public ceremony where they
[54:27] said now and and the father said now now
[54:31] my son is as good as his word is as good
[54:33] as mine and he places him in charge of
[54:36] all things and it's the same thing with
[54:40] us now God wants to adopt us or place us
[54:44] as sons and his kingdom and we have come
[54:50] to the age of adoption remember Adam and
[54:53] Eve they were placed had dominion over
[54:56] all things they were you could say they
[54:58] had their adoption in the beginning
[55:00] because they were they had dominion over
[55:01] all things then send Cayman I think God
[55:05] had to rebuild Adam and Eve again
[55:08] because as the scripture says that Jesus
[55:10] was a second Adam so there's a second
[55:12] adam has to be sick and Eve and that's
[55:14] the Bride of Christ and so the second
[55:17] Adam came to his adoption on Mount
[55:19] Transfiguration this is my beloved son
[55:21] hear ye him and so he was placed but
[55:26] then now the woman has to be placed has
[55:30] to come back into her position and
[55:33] Ephesian says that we are having
[55:36] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[55:38] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[55:40] according to the good pleasure of his
[55:42] will so we predestinated or our destiny
[55:46] has been predetermined so our end so so
[55:50] the end of our journey is as a adoption
[55:53] or replacing
[55:54] and the churches traveled 2,000 years to
[55:58] finally there's a bride on the earth
[56:01] where there is to come the season now
[56:03] where there's going to be an adoption or
[56:05] placing and we're living in that
[56:07] adoption age we're living at adoption
[56:10] age and that's why God deals with yahoo
[56:13] say well he's been dealing with me quite
[56:16] quite heavily it's because he's getting
[56:19] you ready for an adoption because he has
[56:22] to all of his bride has to come to that
[56:24] position hallelujah because that's the
[56:29] season that we live in now he deals with
[56:32] us in that that way so now it's season
[56:37] Galatians 4 and 1 now I say that the
[56:40] year as long as he's a child there was
[56:43] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[56:44] of all we're joint heirs with Christ
[56:47] remember that but as under tutors and
[56:49] governors until the time appointed of
[56:51] the Father even so we when we were
[56:53] children were under bondage under the
[56:55] elements of the world but when the
[56:56] fullness of time was come God sent for
[56:59] the Sun made of a woman made under the
[57:01] law to redeem them that were under the
[57:03] law that we might receive the adoption
[57:05] of sons and because he our sons God set
[57:09] forth the spirit of his son into your
[57:11] hearts crying Abba Father or my father
[57:13] my father wherefore thou art no more a
[57:16] servant but a son and if a son in an air
[57:19] of God through Christ so this is the
[57:24] hour where is the placing or the
[57:27] adoption of sons so God if if God has
[57:32] two wants to adopt us or place us then
[57:35] he sure gonna chasing us and correct us
[57:42] now I'm just going to i'm just going to
[57:47] one this up but so let's hope you see
[57:51] there's Charles because there's trials
[57:54] and this trials because there's chasing
[57:56] it and those two different things and
[57:58] the and God doesn't make it easier for
[58:03] one kind of personality to walk with
[58:05] them then than others because otherwise
[58:08] he has otherwise he has an unfair favor
[58:12] on some group of people and a
[58:14] disadvantage on another group of people
[58:16] it's all the same doesn't matter if
[58:18] you're a Peter or you're an Andrew or
[58:20] Mary or a Martha or woman at the well or
[58:24] Legion in the tomb or Paul or wherever
[58:27] it was doesn't matter what kind of
[58:28] personnel you have God doesn't make it
[58:31] easier for one and harder for the other
[58:33] they're all the same but trials and
[58:37] correction can be one the gift if the
[58:41] gift is great God is going to because
[58:42] especially if you think God doesn't want
[58:46] his gifts outside the body to to to be
[58:49] serving the devil he doesn't want his
[58:51] sons and daughters to be worshiping
[58:53] Satan out there and he doesn't want
[58:55] because the gift has great influence and
[58:57] and Satan knows if he and get a gift it
[59:00] influenced it the wrong way they can do
[59:02] a lot of damage and so that's why people
[59:07] with great gifts they go through a lot
[59:10] of trials until they give over yeah but
[59:14] then some people go through a lot of
[59:15] trials because they can be stubborn and
[59:17] you can be a Peter and beast Avenue you
[59:19] can be an Andrew a prayer and be
[59:21] stubborn it's all the same so we have to
[59:27] I think if we could really just look at
[59:31] how God sees us and the engl and every
[59:36] day God is molding and shaping us a
[59:38] certain way but you have to understand
[59:41] now now the placing of a son I just went
[59:43] maybe want to close on this because it
[59:45] just comes to mind now sometimes we
[59:48] think we listen to the message sometimes
[59:50] we think well we have to be adopted or
[59:53] placed and then God could really use us
[59:56] because our name on the chick is as good
[1:00:00] as the father so to speak but it's not
[1:00:02] necessarily that way you take you take
[1:00:05] Israel they came out of Egypt they go
[1:00:08] through the wilderness now they come to
[1:00:10] Jordan they're going to be adopted or
[1:00:12] placed in the promised land they're
[1:00:14] going to be it's going to be the placing
[1:00:15] of the Sun now in the land when they
[1:00:18] crossed over Jordan they weren't placed
[1:00:21] but
[1:00:22] in the body so they went over Jordan
[1:00:24] which is death to self they gone to land
[1:00:26] they receive the Holy Ghost but they're
[1:00:29] not placed in the land they still took
[1:00:31] Jericho they took a I you know mighty
[1:00:35] things happen because they are in their
[1:00:37] land and then God placed them so they
[1:00:39] had the they had the ability they had
[1:00:41] the authority to do it even just when
[1:00:45] they crossed over they didn't have to
[1:00:47] wait I've got to take my mountain then
[1:00:49] then then I can chase a thousand and to
[1:00:51] 10,000 though they had thee because they
[1:00:54] were walking with God you said in the
[1:00:55] beginning they they had the same
[1:00:58] authority and power as weather with her
[1:01:00] in their land okay but now but when
[1:01:03] you're placed when God adopts or places
[1:01:05] you in the body then the gifting or yo
[1:01:08] that's within you whatever it is can
[1:01:10] work better because you're in your
[1:01:12] correct position or when will that be
[1:01:17] you'll find yourself doing it before you
[1:01:21] realize that's who you really are
[1:01:23] because it's the Spirit of God putting
[1:01:25] you wherever you meant to be and it will
[1:01:27] become natural even in spite of your
[1:01:30] personality and think what you should be
[1:01:33] sometimes God makes give someone a gift
[1:01:36] and it personnel is totally different to
[1:01:37] what that gift us it's just how he does
[1:01:40] it because he wants us to know that it
[1:01:45] is not our it's not because we're wired
[1:01:48] a certain way is because God has made us
[1:01:51] a certain way and this is all the mess
[1:01:53] that's how God works amen this is Bauer
[1:01:57] he's in word of Prayer shall we does
[1:02:00] anyone have a prayer request have have
[1:02:03] anything specific it does just raise
[1:02:06] your hands if you ever need on your
[1:02:08] heartless you know you want to raise
[1:02:09] your hands to the Lord gracious Father
[1:02:12] Lord it's always a joy to look into your
[1:02:15] word because we know it's not a
[1:02:18] storybook it's not just a myth or
[1:02:20] Allegiant but you're a living God and
[1:02:23] everything we read is is for our benefit
[1:02:26] for our good and we want to thank you
[1:02:29] Lord we can just look into your word we
[1:02:31] can look into how your children walked
[1:02:33] Lord and yesteryear
[1:02:35] and we can we can gather we can glean
[1:02:38] for other things from their warp which
[1:02:41] can help hours and dear God we're
[1:02:43] praying just help us Lord babe we always
[1:02:46] just what if we go through trials and
[1:02:49] hardship and we may not know we may not
[1:02:53] see the light at the end of the tunnel
[1:02:55] but lord help us to ways to be of a a
[1:02:58] teachable spirit Lord because you are
[1:03:01] there you're wanting to teach us and
[1:03:03] guide us through everything and father
[1:03:05] help us just to say say Lord what are
[1:03:08] you wanting to teach me in this and
[1:03:10] father may we just run this race with
[1:03:12] patients Lord because faith worketh
[1:03:15] patience our God lord I just pray you
[1:03:18] take this kind of scrambled study and
[1:03:19] put it together by your Holy Spirit and
[1:03:21] Lord may we just have a greater
[1:03:23] confidence Lord an assurance that you're
[1:03:27] our Father and you're guiding us through
[1:03:29] this journey because you want us to be
[1:03:32] conformed to your image and we just pray
[1:03:35] Lord just ask you would help us to be
[1:03:39] more yielded to your spirit Lord in
[1:03:42] every situation may may pride not even
[1:03:45] be a memory Lord may always be humble of
[1:03:49] heart and yielded to you may we never
[1:03:51] think we're better than anyone else but
[1:03:54] Lord may we always just father just may
[1:03:57] we always just thank you for your grace
[1:03:59] and mercy Lord upon us knowing that it's
[1:04:03] nothing we could ever mirror it or do
[1:04:05] even just to continue to walk with you
[1:04:08] Lord it's not because we did anything
[1:04:10] right it's because you are merciful to
[1:04:13] us and we accepted your mercy so father
[1:04:16] I just pray you just take these words
[1:04:17] Lord may dismiss us with your blessing
[1:04:20] granted father we just want to commit
