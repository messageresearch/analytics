our lives can be changed for the better and I believe my trust you've had a good time so far and I believe the Lord is going to continue to bless us because that's what he's in the business of doing if we surrender to Him He blesses us amen so let's um let's stand um tonight and the blessing that I have for you that the Lord has for you this evening is fitting because this morning's message was about wild beasts and and bear hunting season and also we had the um the Hebrew song because we are we have we have been grafted into the promises and that's how we can the promises that God gave to Israel and that's how we as Gentiles can can can read the scriptures that were not necessarily given to us but yeah we're grafted in so we claim them you know that's what it all comes down to is if you want it it's yours there's a song that says when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound in time shall be no more in the morning breaks Eternal bright and fear when the saved of Earth Shall Gather over on the other Shore and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there yeah now I I ask about the songwriter that wrote that song why will he be there you know and to keep it really simple it's just because he said he'll be there I'll be there that's what it comes down to I'll be there I'm gonna be there you know we we disclaim it I'll be there and you will be there if you say well I won't be there I don't want to go then you don't have a chance of going but if you say look yes I like that I'll be there I'm I'm going you know the the violent take it by force this is Satan wants us to say we can't but God just wants us to believe we can that's why brother branham's theme song was only believe all things are possible don't have any doubt just believe don't look back look forward and believe for everything for all things amen so the scripture is from Leviticus now this is talking about land but you can you can type it to your life in whichever way you'd like because we're like land and we're like that and it says then I will give you rain and due season and the land shall yield her increase and the Trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing floor shall reach unto the Vintage [Music] and the Vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I will give you peace in the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and I will rid evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and ye shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by

[Music] foreign [Music] Mighty God great God Amen we thank and praise the Lord for his presence amen for these services will be no good without his presence you know so we're resting upon him we're counting on him and you know God is faithful how many know him to be faithful amen so that means he's faithful tonight because he cannot change he can't be altered he can't go another Direction he has to remain the same so if he's been faithful in things in the past he'll be faithful today so if we could just take him for who he is we'll we'll see our hearts desires manifest in him but we counted the privilege to be with you we thank God for all you've come you know all the different churches the different pastors who've allowed their young people and and saints of God to come and be a part of this I'm always blessed to be here we certainly thank God for brother Ben amen we appreciate him the whole church the local church you know we appreciate all those that cook that clean you know everybody amen it's not just one person doing this amen the day of a one-man Ministry is over amen it's a mini-membled bride Ministry amen so everybody has a part to play you know but we certainly enjoy brother Chris this morning amen did you really enjoy that praise God you know I I was telling him that um you know sometimes and he knows this in different ministers know this that sometimes you can have different thoughts and different things and you just be looking for God to confirm you know so I know what I'm speaking tonight is the will of God because God confirmed it through his message this morning so we we we truly believe that God will have his way tonight and I and I want to say this is part two [Music] amen Hallelujah amen we're thinking we think I I just think and praise God for God called me in men who are not afraid just to be what God called them to be you know I'm sure you can appreciate the same thing let's just have a word of prayer we appreciate all the songs and the music but it's good to be in New Zealand hey man let's just buy our hearts amen and one more thing before we pray if God were Tarry and I would happen to see more years in age I want to be able to preach and look like Paul Freddy amen thank you where's my friend it's called free to raise your hand amen amen praise God I thank God for him amen you know age has nothing to do with it hallelujah amen when I can see a man who's giving half most of his life him and his wife you know if you haven't heard the testimony you need to hear hear it you know or better yet they need to put it on tape or something fleeing and let it go around the world but I certainly appreciate them a man who was together briefly in London and and a man preaching set the place on fire and I was like if I reach that age I want to be like that hey man so I thank God for him and his wife amen you know church we got examples in front of us good examples amen yeah people have turned around and they left but there are more people who stayed and still on fire for God with the same Revelation that God is so this is not a time to be shaken but this is the time to be encouraged so we appreciate you all let's just buy and have a word of prayer amen if you have a need you can acknowledge about uplifting hand Lord Jesus father we love you we thank you for your goodness Lord and Lord we we know Lord without you we'd be lost without you lord we may be in our old denominations and different different places in the city but Lord you came and you grabbed us Lord and you made us a brand plucked out of the fire so Lord we just want to be fit for the Master's use Lord help us to be vessels of Honor Lord and we pray Lord that there's anything in our life Lord that's not pleasing to you Lord you would remove it and replace it with something new and refreshing and Lord forgive us for our sins and trespasses Lord and keep that blood atoning over our lives for Lord we know that you're a covenant God and your Covenant remains true Lord as long as we stay faithful Lord we'll see all the things that you promise hello preach you bless the word tonight we know the word is already blessed Lord bless both speak and hearing Lord You Have Your Way in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen amen amen if you have your Bibles let's go to Matthew the 14th chapter Matthew 14. How great is our God Matthew chapter 14. let's start reading we're going to make the reading so let's start reading that verse um let's start at verse 26. thank you and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the winds boisterous he was afraid and began to sink and begin to sink and he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and called him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore then is thou doubt amen may the Lord bless you reading of his word you can have your seats you know as you're sitting let's turn to Corinthians chapter 10 right quick Corinthians chapter 10. second Corinthians chapter 10 second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 4. second Corinthians 10 and 4 the Bible says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and everything that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal amen but those weapons are powerful enough to pull down strongholds Hallelujah that's what God has given us amen by the by the grace of God tonight I want to use for a subject because I I truly believe that the path I ought to take tonight has already been Vindicated by Brother Chris's message and you know for us to be uh uh bear hunters for us to be lion hunters for us to be giant killers that's something God got to do with us first and what God has to do he has to take away the fear out of the church you know my subject tonight is when there is no fear Hallelujah who are we when there is no fear young people adults family members what are we when there's no fear as a Believer as a Son of God or daughter of God think about that for a moment you know and and that's brother Chris I told him I might keep mentioning his name so don't worry about it amen but as he was preaching you know um the different things that he brought out was so powerful you know to even think about you can hunt a bear there has to be no fear because just the presence of a bear knowing you're just a human brings forth some fear so in order for you to get to God hallelujah leave your house go into the woods and go into the badge territory fear has to be gone Amen in order for you to put the gun in your hand fear has to be gone in order for you to pull the trigger fear has to be gone so Church how much think about what you can accomplish when there is no fear Hallelujah think about what can happen in this church tonight Hallelujah if there was no fear if you Hallelujah if you wasn't afraid of who was looking at you if you weren't afraid of what you did last week or feels or that think about the church if this was a pure atmosphere of Faith what could happen in this place Hallelujah but you know Church fear is something that the devil has perverted Hallelujah fear what is it it's the perversion of faith Hallelujah and the prophet of God said that there's two things you can live by only two not a maybe not it should be not a might be it's only Faith or faith now where are you tonight are you living by faith or fear because there's only two things controlling you right now Hallelujah even in the service you're being controlled by faith or you're being controlled by fear amen but I want to make it real plain what if there was no fear in here [Applause] you know I've been um I've been criticized for exciting the people [Laughter] but I'm all right with that because God's been good to me Hallelujah God's been good to me God heal me he saved me he redeemed me God has taken away my fear hey I'm not afraid to serve God I'm not afraid to worship God of Faith to give him praise Hallelujah I don't care what somebody thinks I know what he's done for me honey I don't worship Him in in fear of what somebody may think Hallelujah you know and let me say this for the for the critics no I'm not trying to excite the people and and to make it even more clearer it's not the person that excites the people it's the word [Applause] if you know the word hallelujah amen and it stimulates you the prophet of God said is stimulation by Revelation it's the Revelation that excites the people oh let's look at it Church Hallelujah when there is no fear amen you know I'm gonna read you some quotes and some different things that the prophet of God said but I want you to catch it amen is hallelujah bear season Hallelujah I'm the Hallelujah to go out and take back those things that the enemy has taken from you [Applause] Hallelujah but how did man look earlier when there was no fear how did he act when there was no fear and we are the greatest example of that in the scripture let's go back to the Book of Genesis amen and let's look at how Adam conducted himself before fear came in his life look at who he was before fear came to this life look at how he talked look at how he walked look at the things he could do before fear came in his life Hallelujah before fear came in his life Adam could talk to creation and it would obey for fear came in his life he could speak to all the animals and not be afraid [Applause] we know the prophet of God's head Advocates speak to the water the river telling the flow a different direction and it would do it y'all don't believe that well if you don't that's what a God is capable of when you are a God everything around you is subject to who you are and Adam was created in the likeness and image of God so everything around him was afraid of him [Applause] everything around him was obedient to evil why because he had the person the nature the likeness the image of God because there was no fear in his life I hope you're seeing yourself now that's what the word does the word comes to remind you of Who You Are that's what this message is all about it's trying to take the fear out of the church Hallelujah one of you young people hallelujah would not be afraid in school anymore and you walk in the authority that God has given you [Music] you know when something God it commands respect [Music] and if you could Hallelujah realize who you are if you could get back to that place that Adam was created in how that Adam was created like Hallelujah you would command respect when you walk in the school room Hallelujah your person will command respect when you go to the job it would command respect because you're in the image in the likeness of God and you're walking without fear [Applause] look most most babies little babies they don't have fear foreign and God has said to us we got to come to him like what the CH like a baby because a baby doesn't have a fear it doesn't know what fear is until something happens Hallelujah you can say don't touch that stone and they'll be right there for you to touch it it could be blazing hot and you say don't touch it don't touch it but they're gonna touch it anyway you know why they're gonna touch it because before they touch it they didn't have any fear [Applause] and there's some things that you've touched and It produced a fear in your life and you're still walking with that fear [Music] but I'm gonna drop something heavy on your church earlier and remember the prophet of God talked about a sister in the house cooking something at least you let's just say it was cheeky [Applause] Hallelujah let's just say she was fried chicken honey and he said the grease popped on a Hallelujah and she began to say ah he said it wasn't the grease that was hot he said was it the grease that burned the Hallelujah he said it was fear that made it react like that so come on [Music] I'll give you another example Harley there are people and some of you may have heard this there are people hallelujah who've gotten shot and didn't even realize they were shot right why because the adrenaline kept them going and it wasn't until they settled down and the biggest thing they saw the blood when they saw the blood but before they saw anything with their eyes they were all right hallelujah amen fear was always dead but it took something to give it a reaction [Applause] and Satan's no good Hallelujah until you give him a reaction [Applause] that particular quote blows me away because I'm sure most of us have been burnt before but he said it wasn't the Greece hallelujah or the oil to be technical it wasn't the oil that hit the skin and said bird he said it was are you sure and you can say brothers I got the Holy Ghost I don't have any fear you want to test it [Applause] you want to test it tonight with your Holy Ghost holy amen see there's a place God's trying to get us back to her but we don't operate with any fear huh and you you might say Brothers I've been in this message a long time holy until you're raptured you'll always be fighting that spirit hold it but let me tell you something you can overcome it on this side yes you can you can overcome it on this side amen but you got to have more faith and fear amen you I don't have fear well let's go out to the lake and see if you can walk on if you can't do it there's another element there Hallelujah I believe we'll all get to that place hardly as there's a need but I don't believe God is in the business of showing off Hallelujah for church if we look and we see what Adam was Hallelujah before sin came in right earlier he had the nature of a God he had the language of a God hallelujah he was so much like God God brought creation to him and God said you name it [Applause] God wasn't afraid to put the world in Adam's hands and when you don't have fear God will be afraid to put the world in your hand [Music] [Applause] because he can't change if he did it before he has to do it again now let me encourage you Hallelujah the prophet of God said all that Adam lost is restored in Jesus Christ that's why the prophet came back and then he said that was empowering you to create a world and go live on Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] let's talk about it for a second this quote kind of caught me and jumped out at me but before I get there remember the Bible says in the Book of Job confessed over his own self he said for the thing that I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me now can you imagine like brother Chris said you out hunting a grizzly and he was like oh my Grizzly where are you oh my Grizzly where are you please don't come and kill me oh Mr Grizzly I know I'm not supposed to be out here in your territory so please don't sneak up on me and eat me with that mindset you're bound to get killed Hallelujah but you go out in the grizzly territory as the aggressor foreign [Applause] I'm coming out here to destroy you I'm coming out here to get me some bareburgers [Applause] Hallelujah and we got our weapons copped Hallelujah and we're ready for the battle Hallelujah see you can't go out there Hallelujah if you don't know who you are think about it if if you're a fisherman and you go out there with your with your fish hook and everything say yeah I'm going out here to give me a big old I'm going out here to catch a Grizzly wrong weapon wrong weapon you Allure a man because I heard Bears like fish but you'll probably eat that fish and eat you you got to meet the enemy with something that can stop him [Applause] and the only thing that can stop the end me is the word of God [Applause] this is how I fight my battle this is how I fight by battle this is how I fight my battle this is how I fight my battle Hallelujah it may look like I'm alone but he's right there with me oh Church young people parents we fight the enemy with the word holy don't be afraid to speak the word because you don't have to back it up God does God has to back up the world let's get to fear out [Applause] okay let's move forward a little bit now we see who Adam was without any fear do we see that without any fear he was a god he was the strongest power on the earth at that time even stronger than the devil [Music] [Applause] you better read your Bible the devil didn't come to Adam he went to Eve because he thought Adam he saw that same one that kicked him out of head Hallelujah and the devil was afraid of Adam Hallelujah it to look like that one in heaven will be afraid of you Hallelujah do you begin to get the mannerisms of God the Thunder of God back inside your being the devil doesn't know what to do with you because when he sees you he sees the father and the Bible says the devil fear and tremble Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] but before the enemy came in that's who Adam was God will come down in the cooler today they have Fellowship holy he could hear God's voice and understand every word he didn't need an interpreter he didn't even need hardly a pastor Hallelujah why earlier because God was doing something personal Hallelujah but seeing brought in all these other administrations so we can get back to God which we need today Hallelujah we need pastors we need evangelists prophets teachers holy we need to fight for Ministry Hallelujah and if you're in a church Hallelujah when the pastor doesn't bring in a FireFold Ministry that means he's afraid [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] Ministry that perfects the Saints [Music] Hallelujah or maybe he got something to hide and he's afraid thank you [Music] now for those of you who may get this tape remember Brothers I didn't call any names [Applause] I didn't call any names I didn't accuse anybody but you know who you are [Applause] Hallelujah this message came to restore [Applause] [Music] brother Brandon believed in the FireFold Ministry so how could you ever say you believe this message and don't believe in the Firefall Ministry [Applause] but I'll say like I always say Holly could be in I'm not a pastor I'm not a pastor so you know what I'm not connected to your feelings [Applause] I can boost the word I can slice I can cut I can Hammer Hallelujah I can Rejoice get on the plane and say praise God brother Ben let's do it again next year [Applause] but a pastor he's connected to your feelings hallelujah amen so there's an element he works with Hollywood which is called sensitivity I was created to kill demons [Applause] and I will stop firing into the gun is empty [Applause] Hallelujah but church we look I'm kind of stuck on Adam and Eve I got to move forward but that's our origin Hallelujah everything was good but then one day Satan came down and went to Eve and he tricked Eve how do you trick her yeah he enticed her but not only did he entice them he made her fearful [Applause] he made her scared she was missing out on something the first element of fear when you feel like you're missing out on something that's what he did to Eve he told us hey God just don't want you to know that you're gonna be as God ain't gonna know things just like him she already knew that [Music] she came from Adam she knew everything that she needed to know for that moment for that time well let me ask you this what else did she receive after she dealt with the Devil because he's here's the scene God comes down in the cooler today and they sit at God's feet and have fellowship and rejoice and God speaks over them and talks over them amen and the animals and everything gather around and the atmosphere is wonderful Hallelujah then Satan comes in messes with Eve hurry gets in her head Hallelujah make her think she's missing something amen she goes takes from him then she goes and gives to Adam and God in his faithfulness comes down like he always does so there's nothing wrong with God there's nothing happen with the nature of God his nature remained the same Faith honest fear God comes down like he always did but in God coming down the Bible said they heard the voice of God walking in the cool of the day like it always did [Music] but now because of sin they are afraid [Applause] where did it come from I want you young people to understand where fear comes from it comes from disobedience Eve simply being disobedient open herself up to fear a life of fear job searching from there God comes down just wanting to have Fellowship like he always does and Adam and Eve are like God is here they never did that before what caused them to run from God sin in their life and I'll tell you pastors the reason why you can't get certain things out of your church is because there's fear in their life there's some Seekers there's some sin there's some things they're holding on to that they're trying to cover remember God is faithful if you are preaching the truth hallelujah you're supposed to get the results of the truth and the only thing to stop those results is if the people's lives are not clean [Applause] oh you don't like that one huh please don't turn the Bloodhound leaves tonight [Music] I want to just preach and we're going to rejoice in the word but if you resist me you turn me into a blood house [Applause] you will get the sniffing [Music] [Applause] we'll get to searching for those things that's holding back your worship [Applause] let me say it like this when did a devil ever sit in the presence of God and God didn't see him [Applause] [Music] and you think you think that height you think you can have things in your life that God won't address devil can never hide himself from God because God is the devil's creator [Applause] and usually people have fear in their life because they have secrets Adam and Eve thought they had a secret and they ran from God all before then God came down to their Fellowship they called to God they heard his voice there was no misunderstandings but now God comes down now they're covering themselves it's just all kind of fear go back and read it the Bible says when he created them and they were naked and what not ashamed yeah what's making you a shame tonight it has to be something in your life something that you're afraid may be exposed because that was the only reason why Adam and Eve ran because now they could see their members from their own eyes when they were already naked and God wasn't even worried about it but now Hallelujah something has gotten in this system to where they're looking at themselves differently that's what happens when you get off the word you start to look at themes that were already right and looking at it wrong everybody all right [Applause] Church now we can see because of sin in their life fear has come in to take over the walk for the rest of their lives fear is an element we have to deal with daily but you can live a life where fear doesn't have control over Hallelujah and you know Church God told them I'm gonna make a way for you to get back Hallelujah Hallelujah God made a way for us to get back God made a way for us to live above our fears but George I want to show you tonight that fear is not connected to your outward man no you're the proper God said there five senses that can contact your natural body and see case hear smell touch Hallelujah those things you can naturally do but fear is not holy connected to it fear is not connected to your eyes no it's that inside memory of what your eyes have seen that brings for fear fear is not connected to your touch no it's your inward Hallelujah affections and and memory and different things Hallelujah that brings back what will happen if you touch it so fear is not connected to the five senses to the outside fear is connected to the inward man okay Hallelujah listen if I can this is what the prophet of God says just to reiterate what I just said like brother Chris said I'll read you the quote he said now did you get them all if you don't then let me know know now you got them all down feet taste feel smell and hear the body that's the open to the body the soul is Imagination what happens if your imagination is connected to fear [Music] I'll tell you a friend of mine I told I wasn't going to tell it but I'm gonna tell it a friend of mine when she was a young girl it wasn't uh she was she was outside staying in the country she was outside and she came out the house was going to the mailbox or something like that and the dog was up the street I think it was a pit bull the dog was up the street and dogs [Music] you know why that dog was barking because he was afraid catch me good a rattlesnake won't bite you unless it's for free the animals of the Kingdom Hallelujah they won't mess with you if you're not messing with them unless Hallelujah so we heard it this morning how brother Chris said animals can sit your fear amen and they don't just automatically attack they have to be afraid they have to feel like they're in danger and you know Church the the dog was barking and carrying on and caring on and she said it was a big old ditch that that separated her from the dog I said did it bite you said no cause they didn't chase you she said no I said what did he do she said barked at me like it wanted to bite me and for that reason I can't be around all she never got bit she never got chased the dog was just making noise but her imagination took it to a whole nother level [Applause] what happens when fear gets a hold of your imagination and now here she is 20 years later still afraid of a dog who never bit her never chase her never did anything but I wonder how many of us in here the devil has got a hold of our imagination Lord I really want to serve you but if I do that I'ma lose all my friends how do you know that you're imagining things [Applause] Lord I I really want to trust you and not take this medicine but I might die how do you know that it's your imagination oh I can feel it let's go surrounded by Your glory I feel like Dance For You Jesus [Music] in your breath oh Hallelujah seeing it up I gotta lead yeah yeah [Applause] and y'all know what's coming next [Music] I don't like that song [Applause] because we don't have to imagine we're going to be surrounded by yourself we're going to be friends we're going to look at his face we're going to touch his hands we're going to be with him forever so I don't have to imagine what it's going to be like dance is the reality [Music] the Born Again experience the problem is all it says it's your down payment I have a down payment I already got a kick it to Heaven I don't have to imagine [Applause] Hallelujah will you imagine things can change [Applause] when it comes to God we don't have to imagine we have scripture which is a promise [Applause] but if you're going to imagine let it work for your good say things like I can't wait I'm in heaven there with Peter James and John honey I can't wait Hallelujah to sit down with David oh yeah and for him to describe to me what it was like we're gonna lie if we're down [Applause] what it was like to have a real hunting season when David tell me hallelujah how he slapped that bear how he slapped that Lionheart in the arm and he took that seat back first that's going to happen we're going to see the faith alone we're going to talk to him [Applause] Hallelujah the Bible says hallelujah say without us it's been perfect it's got to happen Hallelujah so if you're going to imagine what's written is true it's true and even right now the Bible says in the last days the world me and his Hearts will fail for what are we here are we here at church and how he started with Russia holy amen the bear of the north holy y'all know pooping crazy they can't vote him out because they keep changing the laws not to be voted out and if anybody Rises up against him they got trouble you know right now honey the spirit that's on him Was the Same Spirit that was on his look Church you give it a little bit more time he'll have concentration camps cause he's already made it mandatory from 18 to 32 you got that list in the army you made it y'all didn't know that stay on top of it because we at a time well you can't fake like you know how to shoot the gun I don't know about y'all but I like talking practice any chance I get to go shoot it I'm out there shooting it but we're in a day now where it's so Advanced earlier I don't know about your guns but y'all know how we America we'll Trigger Happy we walk in grocery stores scrapped Hallelujah and it's so bad some people even went in the church we ain't going that far at my church we still believe in the angel of the Lord [Music] who can wipe out 36 000 demons just like that we don't have to be afraid amen God came out of the Hezekiah and told him he shall not come into the city Hallelujah then God went down and destroyed all of them amen that's the God we saw [Applause] because when we look when you look and you see what is connected to the inward man look he says the soul is the imagination just imagine if fear is connected to your imagination before you could even do something we begin to imagine some of you young Brothers Hallelujah you can't even go talk to that Christian young girl because you imagine it she gonna shoot me down how do you know how do you know you may be the the knight in shining armor that she's been waiting on but you let your imagination run before you and you stay single and you let fear suppress your desire foreign and wanting a Christian woman is a Godly desire and you let fear Hallelujah get in your imagination and suppress a Godly desire shame on you sister y'all should see how these brothers looking at me now [Applause] look I'm gonna give you a little one-on-one and I'm gonna leave this alone Brothers holy Don't Be Afraid all she can say is two things yes or no [Music] Hallelujah just go through the proper channels amen make sure you go through the proper channels amen and everything will be done decent and in order but if you are afraid you know what you'll do you'll go in them DMs [Applause] hey if you afraid of Papa [Applause] you afraid of Papa you slide into the Dead the fear in your life Hallelujah but if you're a man and you you you're confident that your experience is right you won't be afraid to go to Papa and talk to Papa about Papa's angel but if you got secrets [Applause] you got fees Hallelujah that you're afraid might come out you continue to slide [Applause] yeah parents I want you to know this world has made it real easy for your innocent children to come in contact with the unsaved world and I'm not so much talking about in the world I'm talking about in here young men that are not converted girls that are not converted trying to get your children [Music] [Applause] but you have to stay highly on guard Don't Be Afraid earlier to tell your child no yes Hallelujah I know we've getting a little bit more lenient and things like that but look the devil ain't playing come to kill still in the storm Hallelujah and how often do we see Hallelujah some some young guy or some young woman slide into the DMS and they get close and next thing you know they take their virtue and then dump them [Applause] don't want them no more let me let me leave it out but imagine that's your imagination brothers and sisters and you notice I said Brothers approaching not sisters Hallelujah Brothers It's not their job [Applause] I hope y'all paying attention it's not their job to be in your face [Music] [Applause] and let me tell you some sisters ain't no godly man looking for that anyway [Applause] Hallelujah cause they're making real plain I know brother Chris talked about hunting and hunting bears and different things but let's make it only bring it up to a smaller scale think about deers Hallelujah you never you've never seen a door or buck jump out and say here I am no that man had to hunt he had to spend time in the area he had to drop food he had to put cameras up so she jumping out there saying here I am you look the other way let me leave it alone listen the soul is the imagination conscious think about when fear is connected to your conscience there's certain things you can't even believe God in because the enemy is messing with your conscience if I do this disclaim if I do that that will happen you remember the last time when that happened the enemy messing with your conscience fear in your conscience your imagination your conscience let's keep going and this is the one that gets all of us memory [Applause] you may try to do so many turns out wrong and then Satan will come and say you remember last time you remember last time don't you don't you do that you went down this road and this and that don't you do that all right now but maybe the last time you did he wasn't safe Maybe This Time God is leading you [Music] Maybe This Time God is in control so don't let your memory of things pass stop you Hallelujah from living in your presence [Applause] Hallelujah don't let the memory of past mistakes Hallelujah stop you from believing God is real Hallelujah imagination conscience memory and this is you you see how they so easily be affected by fear and the next one is reasoning we good at that we're good at reasoning you know God will come specifically and say certain things through the word of God or through the ministry and the first thing we give God is a conjunction Lord but recently reasoning earlier when it's connected to your fear it can stop you from moving forward in God it can stop you from seeing things that God has ordained for you to see because you reason it away remember the scripture says it's for our benefit the scripture says what come let us reason together so reasoning is supposed to work for the believer's benefit but if fear is connected to it you reason yourself out of God's plan and we have so many churches so many spread out Believers different places and everything why because of well that past is a good pastor but I believe he's preaching the word of God but earlier and normally when you're reasoning what are you doing when you're reasoning against the word of God you're calling God a liar um keep in mind when I said you're reading the word of God now to make a real plane the Bible says that God is our healer and for you to reason away from that you're killing God no he's not God says he's our provider and you won't pay your tithes you're saying God is a liar we afraid to trust him like my pastor say he don't he don't normally just come out and take a text and preach on tithing but what he do he's trying to help somebody and what he'll say he said it real plane say look the Bible says if you do what you're blessed ties an offering is a blessing [Music] I can't believe it we're still wrestling with that we're still wrestling with pain tithe that's so Elementary one two three we should be waving we we know seals and Thunders and everything and can't pay tops you're going to be kidding me we got all the mysteries of God hallelujah and keep a touch denomination got more Revelation than you in that area brother Brown never preach on money well in case you didn't know this I'm not Brother Bruno and like my pastor always says he says look when I go down these Avenues what I'm trying to do is get you to see what the scripture says the scripture says you're blessed if you do it you're blessed if you don't you curse if you're not praying your tiers and say I'm trying to get the curse out your life [Applause] foreign you don't get to tell God how to judge you you don't get to tell God how to deal with you in this area he may not only deal with your finances he might let the devil have your health because they didn't say I will curse you this way so don't play with God don't be afraid church I've seen God take a hundred dollars and stretch it [Music] [Applause] y'all got a witness in here only one only one person to see God stretch it I've seen God straight to church just being faithful to God earlier and God take what I give it to him and make that thing laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh then you put some more on top of it and then laugh and laugh laugh let me put some more problems and laugh and laugh he promised that he will provide our needs [Applause] and if you Hallelujah do not pay tithe and offering that's because you have fear in your life and the last one is affection what about your fears are connected to affection it's like people who've been hurt you take a young lady or a young man you've been hurt when he was a child or maybe molested or something like that let me say something while I'm preaching if I'm saying certain things and I'm hitting certain things that mean it's in here because I can't preach on anything that's covered already by the blood so in order for me to speak only that means it's on the top yes it's not covered so your fear of molestation can be dealt with tonight holy God can deal with that Spirit where you'll never have to deal with the memory of it again affecting your son Hallelujah there are people in church carrying these things that happen to them in their childhood and it produces a life of fear you think a young man or a young lady that maybe had those issues when they were younger and now they're married Hallelujah they can't even be true Hallelujah to the one that loved them because of the fear in their life living in their memory living in their conscience living Hallelujah in their imagination and now they're living in their affections because things have happened that produce the fear I ain't gonna be too much longer y'all know I'm about to close but Church think about it I like how brother Chris was saying that we've been equipped with training [Music] and when you're confident in your training there's no fear when you know you've took time to get the proper training when you get to the fight you rely on that training and normally the person that trains you have already been through it foreign and if God has given us his word hallelujah for whatever battle it may be that means God has already conquered it so all we have to do is stay with the training that God has given us he's given us the weapons of warfare which are not carnal but they're given to us to to pull down these stroke holes in our life and you don't have to be afraid to serve God amen oh yeah let me read you something right quick listen with the prophet God said this isn't a mess it's a personal experience with God paragraph 43. this he says he says this loving him he said oh we say we have faith we have love but if we had love we'd have faith for that is perfect love casts out all fear and this is what I like when you say that as little as he says and when fear is gone faith is perfect [Music] so think about that tonight Hallelujah if we could create an atmosphere Hallelujah amen of True Divine love if we can create an atmosphere where we love God if we love God fear is gone and Faith becomes perfectly Church basically I'm saying hallelujah if we create an atmosphere where there is no fear you can have whatever you ask God for amen because Faith becomes perfect in that channel and you can receive what you believe in God for if there's no fear a lot of times we don't get what we're asking God for because we don't believe it because we got so many natural things connected to it when God just wants us to take him at his word [Music] Hallelujah that's all you want he want us to take him at his word he says now did you get them all nah I ain't gonna read that oh he said see it's your mind that opens up the door what causes us to fear your stars right here the problem of God said your mind is a womb and before Satan gets any way with you he has to plant a seed here to get you to believe it the prophet of God say before it manifestes as a spirit it has to be received as a thought first how do people get cast in their body they receive what the doctors say right right most people just living their lives they mind their business going on they say hey I'm gonna go get a checkup feeling good they go get the check up and the dollars like oh my we found the lump they didn't even know the lump was there living a regular life doing what they normally do going to work playing with the kids everything everything's good and you mean to tell me a lump go alter my life I can hit you in your arm real hard that's the thing we call a frog you know pop up in your arm just a regular law and you mean to tell me that I can alter your life just a bruise what happens when fear is connected to us then it turns into something that you are believing in give it life and y'all know my story I had cancer in my brain Hallelujah but God in his his his grace Hallelujah a loud a word to be given to me from someone who wasn't afraid of cancer man I thank God for Mama [Music] she could have been oh no my child's gonna die oh he got cast in his brain she walked in the hospital room and say son you don't have to receive this she said my God Is A Healer by his stripes you're healed and all you got to do is confess it and believe it and God will honor his word Hallelujah so what I'm saying to your church sometimes even if Hallelujah your children don't believe Hallelujah you can stand in the gap [Applause] somebody need to stand in the gap and stop worrying about what you see them doing and believe what you know God can do Hallelujah I don't live by my eyesight amen I don't live by my my regular seasons of the body I live by faith we live by faith Hallelujah church and we made the whole hospital system out to be alive [Applause] go away we throw chemotherapy go back where you came from not this time put your radiation go back where you came from not this time all I got is out there 53. and I'm gonna stand on that and believe [Applause] and if you ever see God move once oh the prophet of God said you meet those conditions and God will move again the same way I've been told I got diabetes at least he's four times and all four times I looked at doctor with a practitioner whoever they was in their face and saying no I don't and by the time we was finishing they were confessing the same thing no you don't oh yeah [Music] [Applause] and he ain't trying to get you to be afraid this last time I went earlier this year I was doing just a regular physical you know get my because I have a commercial driver's license which I haven't drove commercially in but 12 years now I'm being a full-time evangelist but but I don't believe in giving things back that God blessed me with Hallelujah so I I pay that fee and I keep that license you never know I might have to jump in the truck and drive somewhere if that time comes I want to be ready Hallelujah but you know church I I I went to renew everything and I had you as a truck driver you ought to take a deal what they call a DOT physical and just to show that you're fit to drive over the roads and all these things and I go to the place and it's a young dog a new new guy say he's been he's been a graduated now out of school and all that he's been about a full doctor for a year now and you know they take the test and and uh you know always come down to the urine and you know and you know something up when they start whispering I'm like I'm right in the room while y'all tell me what y'all saying [Music] stay away from them people who whispered in church [Music] [Applause] oh we're behind somebody back [Applause] girl I heard that's why I told you you know what the Bible calls a silent Whisperer slender Look up the word slanderer in the Bible it means silent whisper and what I what I can't stand is as as as much as the person that's whispering but the person the gossip always come to [Music] if you're one of those people that the gossip always come to you need to check yourself because why are those things about that has nothing to do with you always find this way to your ears why do people feel comfortable bringing you the trash [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I don't know about you but that'll make me feel uneasy why they always bringing this junk to me why am I always the trash can why is everybody always unloading all the stuff that's going on to me it says something about your character but Church anyway [Applause] they come in and do they test get your example all that and then they started whispering and things and this and that says well you got diabetes no I don't so yeah your glucose your fructose your East Coast your West Coast your light toast your doctor whatever kind of toast you got I ain't got no diabetes [Applause] Hallelujah church we have to not be afraid to stand on the word [Applause] I know it's late I'm trying to close but now we finna do this look back and forth yes you do I have to ask I hit him with this doctor say you're a slight sugar this and that say dog that's a pre-workout you see [Applause] I was telling Christians and that message was for me this morning because I try to keep this body of death in subjection by working out a little bit you know and trying to reverse the curse Brothers I want to let y'all know we've already reached the height we're going to get to when you get over 25 you've reached that height so if you're not careful you'll see yourself growing but it won't be up [Applause] Hallelujah and I've been there so now I'm trying to keep it under subjection but I was telling him that the place where I work out at my trainer when Chris was saying that brother Branham he wanted to go out on his own without the Ranger and my trainer is a retired Ranger so I was getting all kind of confirmation this morning to priest [Music] ESS why because God wants you to be free from your fears whatever's body whatever whatever has you afraid Tonight Tonight is the Night To Go free from it in church they took the test and all these things and say you got this you got that I said no it's a pre-workout he said nah it don't come through your body like that and I was like excuse me and I'm thinking to myself Church when you drink liquid where does it come out at liquid comes out the place where liquid comes out so what do you mean it doesn't come out like that see if you're not careful they have you believing in things that's not even sensible if I drink some water it has to come out my body as a liquid [Music] anyway so he was like no man this and that this he said well let's do a blood test I say praise God [Music] let's do a blood test the time they want to test me by the blood I've already got the victory anytime any doctor any situation who to test you by the blood and you confess your sins you confess them as your savior that blood of Jesus Christ is a covering [Applause] that blood will cover you Hallelujah in the hospital in the seafood in your schools or your job in your church that blood has never lost its power and we don't have to be ashamed found on the blood Hallelujah Republic God said with Jesus he don't see you he sees blood so how are you ever going to tell me I got diabetes when I didn't confess my sin and claimed him as my savior [Applause] listen they say we're going to test you by the blood I didn't get afraid come on which arm you want which vein you want let's do it I know the blood hasn't lost its power Church realize when you're believing God for something Hallelujah God has to honor that testimony [Applause] God knows his reputation is on the line [Music] [Applause] so you're standing on his name and you're standing on his attributes hurry up God cannot fail because it would change his testimony it will change his reputation Hallelujah so they do the blood test they tell me I had to I had to go to Canada that week it was Wednesday that Friday I was supposed to be in Canada so they said well call back Saturday and we'll let you know what the results are all right Deuces peace out now let them take the test jumped in the car got on the plane see I didn't let those words alter any of my plans I didn't let the proclamation of what they were saying alter my life from being what God made me to be see there was no fear in that moment so I could continue on my path and when you don't have fear you can continue on your path to be great in God's economy honey and you know Church Hallelujah I got over there they called me they said Saturday I think they call me Friday and I was like man I'm a giant I got back home they called me again so I wasn't even I wasn't even trying to go get the results because God can't change I just needed that card that said everything was good and I had to worry about my license so anyway uh they called me again I said I'm on my way up there today so I get up there he said hey Mr D's everything check out good you good my God is faithful [Music] My God is Awesome he can move mountains he can hide you in the storm Hallelujah and churches this young guy he begins to talk to me he said he say look man why'd you take a pre-workout I say cause I'll work it out he said well but next time why don't you do that don't don't do that the next time you come outside whatever y'all know last time it was tea and the time before that it was tea and cookies so I switched it up a little bit this time but the same results Hallelujah you only have what you confess amen and a lot of times we confess those things because we don't believe and there's a fear connected to it but in church now I'm supposed to get a card that says I'm good for two years so Donald was filling out everything and this and that and you know sometimes you go through things because God has something special for you in return but he wants you to stand and you know he was just right the card out or whatever and you know it was February so my car is supposed to be good for February 2022 the February 2024 that's two years so I got my card I walked out of the office and everything I started reading and reading paperwork and my expiration date said it was February 2022 to February 2032. [Applause] I ain't never got to be tested for another 10 years hopefully by then the Rapture be in some place Hallelujah but when God do something he always do it for your benefit [Applause] and go through the test and trust God because I guarantee you to work out for your benefit I'm a cold but I want to show you the power of fear if y'all got being did y'all get it because y'all put it up let's go we're gonna hit this real quick I want to show you how powerful fear is what are we just story this is this guy named was Nick and say Nick was a tough guy with a with a bad Outlook he worked for a railroad one night after all his fellow workers were gone from home going home he accidentally locked himself in a refrigerated boxcar now can you imagine getting locked up in a refrigerator train car and everybody's gone listen he said worried that the temperature was below freezing he yelled for help now he's panicking he said but to no avail the more he thought oh not fear is in his mind it's creating something he said the more he thought about the situation the colder he felt listen his thoughts is dealing with his body he hadn't even been that long but just his thought process started to make him cold Ma your thought process can make you cold when it comes to the things of God listen Dakota he felt to eventually he started shivering unconditionally his thoughts was doing that he's panicking so I'm in the Box call me in the refrigerator he's yelling hell his mind is saying You Finna die convinced he was dying Who convinced him nobody else was in there with him nobody was at work who convinced him he was dying the thoughts he received you know who convinced him fear listen he wrote a letter to his family outlining what had happened the next morning they found Nick's body and autopsy revealed that he indeed frozen to death sure he went through all the steps to prepare himself to die did he die let's keep reading he died it says the options revealed that he indeed froze to death but the investigation discovers something puzzling The Boxcar in which Nick was trapped was out of order and had been disconnected the refrigerated boxcar was not even working so what was making him cold fear what was freezing his body fear what made him die in that box car fear fear controlled his whole body it had been disconnected the night he froze to death listen the temperature in the boss car was 61 degrees just below room temperature he could have lived in there to the next morning but fear created an atmosphere of what that fear creating an atmosphere of death and he received the spirit of death and then he died in a boxcar which was normal temperature but because the experience he but because he expected to die he lost the battle where in his mind listen how this whole thing started out Nick was a tough guy [Music] he was so tough he killed himself he was a tough guy with what a bad Outlook don't let the devil give you a bad Outlook on what it means to be a Christian right because if you take on that kind of attitude you might end up killing yourself just below room temperature but because he expected to die he lost a battle in his mind would you believe about your life is more important than what anyone else believes job said what I feared was come upon me be careful what you anticipate listen to that be careful what you anticipate what you anticipate will begin to become part of your actions and actions will turn into a birth of something where am I would you believe about your life is most important to anybody else believes job said would he fear has come upon me because you anticipate negative expectations become self-fulfilling prophecies I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you something about myself everybody all right [Music] I didn't grow up in a in a from from a child in a message home amen my mom came into the message when I was a teenager but you know although I was shaped in the world and I had worldly Tendencies and everything I saw God do something in my mama that was so real I knew God was real just the the measures of patience he had with us the things where she would she would talk to us about it now just as I just seeing her character and things change I saw that right before my eyes and you know what that started to do for me it started to let me know that God was real but even even knowing that I still didn't just give myself to the Lord but I saw God do something for my mom and you know what even though I was in the world my heart's desire was I a Christian how do I have bad habits oh do I look like the world do I did things I wasn't supposed to do in my heart I was always confessing God I want to be a Christian and Satan doesn't know what's in your heart [Applause] so even though you make mistakes Hallelujah who are you really inside here keep confessing I will be a child ago I will be a son of God oh I am a son of God I am a daughter make your confession of faith and not a fear Hallelujah put it back up be careful what you anticipate negative expectations become self-fulfilling prophecies God has promised to help you but you get the deciding vote give me that God has promised to help you you got to put the gun up in there you got to go to where the Grizzlies are and Hallelujah you got to do something about focus on negative things you agree to let Satan defeat you oh my God I hope you're getting this Jesus said according to your faith will it be done for you Matthew 9 29 another trans another translation like this become what you believe Hallelujah become what you believe so get the agreement with God's word and focus on his promises instead of your problems when you do your faith will take you to new levels of victory but it's up to you to take the first step come on musicians musicians come as we wrap this up when fear was gone Adam could hear the voice of God and remain in the presence of God and not be afraid when fear was gone Peter could walk on water Hallelujah he said Jesus there's a spirit he said it is I don't be afraid then Peter says Hey Lord if that's you being me to come Jesus didn't say go and pray he didn't say going fast he didn't say wait on the special meetings he said come on and Peter stepped out on something in his life that wasn't solid and it became solid and these guys were fishermen he knew he wasn't supposed to walk on that water but what gave him the strength to do it he had his eyes on Jesus and as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus there was no fear in his walk there was no fear in his steps as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus every step he made was a solid step [Music] even though in previous days hallelujah he would have Saint in that water but this was a moment God was going to show him where his faith can take him if there's no fear Peter walks on water he gets out there and the Bible says a tempestuous boisterous wind comes he takes his eyes off Jesus and he focuses back in on fear and he begins to begin what happened nothing happened with Jesus nothing happened with the water it was still the same water it was all in how Peter saw it when he was walking in faith with his eyes on Christ he was doing things that he couldn't naturally do he was back Hallelujah fulfilling what Adam was Hallelujah character let me let's make this real plane that was without the Holy Ghost [Music] there's levels to this thing look [Music] and then Peter begins to sink and he cries out to Jesus save me and God grabs him and pulls him up and the first thing God does [Music] why does he rebuke him because he's supposed to have the faith to control his surroundings he's supposed to have the faith to control his walk he's supposed to have faith Hallelujah to make every step a solid step and you are supposed to have the faith to control the steps that you'll take [Music] when fear was gone he walked on water when fear came back he began to sink and I'll end with the same thing from this morning when fear was gone David killed the lion David killed the bear when there was no fear David walked up to a nine foot man [Music] Hallelujah that the whole Army was afraid of that kingdoms and nations were afraid of David walked up to him looked him in his face and prophesied over here David looked at everybody else's fears and said I'ma show you what a Son of God is supposed to operate [Applause] what God is supposed to do [Music] that is devil he looks at that bad Harley he looks at that giant and he said this day I'm gonna cut your head off foreign [Applause] [Music] thing about prophecy Hallelujah prophecy doesn't operate inferior operates in faith and David spoke cut Goliath's head off and didn't even have a sword [Music] Hallelujah that's when you're walking in a real atmosphere [Applause] [Music] where you can speak the things you need and it'll show up in battle Hallelujah David didn't have a sword but when the light went down David ran up on Goliath and used the enemy sword against him [Applause] now all the things the devil told you you wouldn't be I want you to use that stuff against him honey and tell him I will be what God wants me to do I will be the daughter
