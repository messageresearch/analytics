Grace is something that you don't deserve but it's given to you it's given to you freely amen now I wonder if a million dollars was given to you freely would you take advantage of it most of us would

the Lord for being here we s greetings from our church you know and Pastor back home and South Carolina you know and uh first time here with brother Ben and uh such a wonderful brother we certainly

right you know and I believe we'll see even more greater things than what we're see so I'm not I'm not a man of many words outside of preaching the gospel so let's pray and then we'll get into the scripture amen let's bow our hearts amen if you have a a unspoken request you can acknowledge it to the Lord by an uplifted hand cuz he knows all things Lord father you see we lift our hands to you

Lord God let us be the instrument that shows that there is a true and living God in the city of Wellington Lord Lord God forgive us of our sins and our thoughts that's not like your thoughts and our

deserve amen and Lord we bind every principality of evil every thought that's not of your thought that would hinder the move of the spirit and Lord we yield to your presence and your way tonight in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ we pray Let the church say amen amen somebody say amen amen hallelujah amen means so be it Hallelujah if you have your Bibles amen let's turn to um St John the 8th chapter John 8 St John 8 and um let's start reading at verse 28 St John 8 and 28 then we going to go to um second Peter the Bible says we have't say Amen then said Jesus unto them St John 8:28 When ye lift up the son of man then shall ye know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father have taught me I speak these things and he sh and and he that sent me is with me the father have not left me alone for I do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen they answered him we be Abraham seed and were never in bondage to any man now Saye thou ye shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house of forever but the Sun abideth forever if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed am amen let's go to Second Peter brother that was fine you can turn that back down by God's yeah you can cut it on low brother second Peter um 1 second Peter 1 and verse3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye may ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen may the Lord a bless read of his word you can have your seats tonight amen and as you sit let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen wonderful Jesus amen hallelujah you know by by God's grace I I I I just love the Lord amen and you know we just we just want to try to present something to you tonight that you could you know grab hold of that you can apply to your life and and and and serve God in a in a in a in a greater way amen yes sir you know because I think sometimes we we look at church as just a a a sermon but no it's more than just a seron you know me being here tonight is more than just a man from South Carolina coming to preach you know you have to know and believe that you're a son and daughter of God and everything that comes everything that comes from God it has to be personal amen amen whether whether it be uh brother Ben or or or me or some preacher standing behind this pull pit preaching to you you have to take it personal amen you have to say Lord uh uh speak to me Lord I I need to hear from you Lord I have certain things in my life that I need to be addressed amen we have to take it personal this this can't be a a one-way relationship just just you saying uhh uh God is my God and that's it no it has to be a relationship Lord You're my father and I'm your son Lord You're my father and I'm your daughter and and a father expects something from his children just as uh uh children expect something from their father it's a relationship amen amen and that's what we have to that's what this has to be as the Lord approaches us amen you know it it can't just be a good seminar on this is not a seminar I don't have a bag of tricks to give you after service I don't have some candy bars or some some fruit rollups or something to give out the only thing I have is more of Christ Hallelujah so we not out to take these things and just just just look at it at oh this is just another church service no this is a me with the almighty God yes sir Hallelujah yes sir that's how you have to look at it it's a relationship amen it's like uh uh uhh when I travel and I've been gone a long time when I get back my wife is she no longer has to hold a picture right amen right that's right the real me steps off that plane yes sir and I get in a car with her and she can touch me amen hallelujah she can look in my eyes amen Hallelujah my voice is no longer just a vague memory but she can hear it not only that she can respond to my need G Glory hallel think about that church God wants you to be able to respond to his need that's right hallelujah amen so tonight by God's grace I want to challenge you step out of your comfort zone amen hallelujah I may do some things and say some things you've never seen before you've never heard before and you may look at it and say man are we in church is he supposed to do that let me be me and you be you Hallelujah and I guarantee you God will be lifted up amen but you know tonight by God's grace what I want to to to to use for a thought you know uh and before I give you this thought you know I want you to understand something that this gift this preaching gift belongs to you amen amen how many want a gift tonight how many love getting gifts you know you don't just take a gift and put it in the corner but you unwrap it Hallelujah because you want to see what it is hallelujah and hopefully it's something that you can use hopefully it's something that you've been longing for and when you get that gift Hallelujah you use it you use it for what is for amen and I'm a gift I'm a tool Hallelujah to speak to you in God's stead Hallelujah so you have to work the gift of evangelism tonight Hallelujah so God can speak to you and you can leave out he encouraged Hallelujah pressing on serving the lord amen that's why I say it should be a relationship and one thing I I see see even right now I'm a little I'm a little quick on the trigger Hallelujah so I I hope you can understand my my Southern language and all these things so just just just bear with me amen see it don't take long for me to get excited about Jesus Christ amen this has this my excitement has nothing to do with you my excitement has to do what God has done for me Hallelujah so when it comes to the things of God Amen it doesn't take me long Amen to get excited about what God has done in my life Hallelujah and whether you stand there and just look at me and show no emotion that won't bother me one bit hallelujah hallelujah cuz I got a shout on the inside I got Joy on the inside God has been good to me Hallelujah and you can't tell my story like I can Hallelujah but I love God Amen and you know Church you know uh the prophet of God he said that you operate the gift amen amen so even right now while I'm preaching if there's things in your life that you need from God why don't you channel that amen say Lord I need Clarity Lord I need to know if I'm in the right place Lord I need to know my next step God speak to me hallelujah amen think about how refreshing that is when you come to church and God talks to you oh I love that when it happens but you know I I just want to I just want to uplift you tonight church because I've heard some of the testimonies and I believe God is doing something in willing Hallelujah I believe he's not done amen I believe he wants to use some of you amen but you got to want to be used you got to say Lord here am I what will you have me to do Hallelujah but you know church is tonight by God's grace my subject is is it may sound kind of strange but I I I I just want to express something to you like God gave it to me and my subject tonight is in a couple of words to be continued Amen to be continued and most of us tonight we're here because God has been dealing with us and I want to say to you that's not just that one particular time when he when he uh introduced himself and maybe he changed your life maybe you were you were in the world and you were doing worldly things and then God came in and and you were delivered from something and you're like wow God is so great I'm going to church it's not over amen more of God hallelujah to be revealed amen and that's what the subject means tonight amen when it comes to your life you have to tell the devil that the picture is not over amen hallelujah there may be a part one but there's also a part two and sometimes the sequel gets all the way to part five or part six or part seven but what part are you in amen you ought to be able to say to the enemy God is not done with me amen there is is a day to be continued amen that there is more of God there's more of God I want to see there's more of God I'm craving there's more of God I need God to do in my life my life is a continual unveiling of God's grace Hallelujah and God has always been that place God has never stopped moving Hallelujah so this this is basically like a a stee of the grace of God you know when we look at the scriptures we look at what we read and sometimes we wonder you know are we where we supposed to be well I ask you that question Hallelujah are you where you supposed to be what is God doing in your life yeah or are you just satisfied with a good church to be continent Hallelujah there should be more of God hallelujah you should be grabbing for more of God Amen there should be a hunger a desire for more of God but you know as a evangelist what I found out is that people get satisfied with just coming to church it's more than just coming to church that's right it's it's all about a relationship it's all about Christ becoming tangible amen everything that you read everything that you listen to it becomes a lifestyle you know that's why diets don't work right amen diets don't work because people do not change their life St they shock their systems and they may lose some weight and they may get a little healthy but they don't get rid of the junk food Hallelujah they don't they don't uh become enemies with the junk owl at the grocery store right but they keep venturing back and going back into those places and the weight continues to come back why because they don't change their lifestyle and that's what we have to do church when God deals with you you don't just get complacent Hallelujah God is telling the devil the devil will see you he'll see you settling down but God is in his ear saying to be continued right I'm not done with them there's more that I want to show the world Hallelujah there's more inside of that seed that hasn't been revealed yet Hallelujah think about that church when you were in the world you were in the club Hallelujah the devil was looking at you saying you're this and you're that and God is saying what I'm not finished to be continued amen you may have messed up and messed up bad and Satan said I got them and God was say nope there's another scene nope there's another sequel NOP there's another part of the script to their life Satan this is not over like we say back home in our own Southern slang it ain't over amen hallelujah and that's where you ought to say right now amen no matter how you feel no matter what your shortcoming may be you ought to say to the devil it ain't over over I'm still hungering for God hallelujah there's still something down on the inside that's craving the mighty one amen there's still more deliverance from me amen see one thing about medicine Hallelujah you can have medicine amen if you hold it and you let it sit in one place so long all of the things that's that'll make that that that that medicine work it falls to the bottom right and it gets settled and everything around it is no good all the power of that medicine settles in the bottom and the only way you can use that is if you shake it up right Hallelujah am Hallelujah you don't just pour it in the spoon that's right no Shake It Up first hallelu and the instructions are shake well H you can't just and then put it no you got Hallelujah and sometimes believe it or not God has to shake you up God has to shake up your life Lord God has to sometimes allow you to go astray and Chase your own dreams Hallelujah so he can shake you upen and bring you back hallelujah hallelujah see I know what I'm talking about amen that's been a time in my life where God had to shake me up amen hallelujah sitting in church amen not really getting anything from God but then God let me run astray Hallelujah to Chase my own dreams and my own thought P only to allow me to get tired and once I got tired Hallelujah I went back to God and you know what he was saying to the devil you thought it was over but it was to be continued hallelujah it's like a Batman and Robin movie Hallelujah you know back in the day when we used to watch that amen they'd be right in the middle of a fight scene and Batman and Robin would be all tied up and it looked like they were going to be they were going to be destroyed or something and then those words came across the stream to be continue what did that do that put you in expectation that's right that made you want to see the outcome that made you say it's not over Hallelujah and God is doing that right before the devil's eyes the devil looks like he has some of you all tied up but God is saying to be continued Hallelujah let me say it like this church your enemy God created him that's right amen that's right Hallelujah anybody going through a struggle about three of you so the rest of you are already in the Rapture Hallelujah goad amen I think God for my trials and tribulation amen because what those trial let's read the scripture to be continued Genesis the third chapter Genesis three now the devil seems like he has so much power you I get amen do I have a church in here tonight amen I say can I get an amen hallelujah amen means so be amen amen means I agree Hallelujah and you know the preacher loves amen hallelujah so that lets me know that you are appreciate the word of God that's right so whenever I hear the word and it's channeling through what I need I say amen hallelujah because what I'm doing I'm expressing to God that I agree and that that word hallelujah is now being applied to my life so I say amen hallelujah amen and you know church as I look at the scripture you know and I begin to think about this this particular scene of to be continued you know it it it we we we look in Genesis and we know the story of Adam and Eve and how creation fell and then once they fa Satan he looked like he did a good job he looked like what he wanted to accomplish he accomplished it you know he he he was kicked out of heaven amen amen we we we know that he he was once in heaven he was once an anointed chub he was once God's right-handed man God put him in that position Hallelujah think about that God let his enemy be so close to him Hallelujah so close to him that he this is about to be powerful now he let his enemy get so close to him that his enemy would want to be just like him when you look at the Devil you look at Lucifer you read your scriptures he's not some just wild animal wild beast he wants to be like God everything about him wants to be like God Satan wants to be worshiped Satan wants to have a church Satan wants his own Seed where does he get that from he wants to be just like God and he'll tell us don't pray don't read your Bible don't have communion with God he'll tell us don't desire to be like God when he wants to be just like God a't that such a hypocrite yeah amen your enemy is such a hypocrite he'll come to you and tell you all these things about God when he wants to be just like God what a hypocrite so you know what you ought to do when Satan's talking to him you ought to say shut upen the very thing you're telling me not to do you're going to go do that's right amen think about that the very thing Satan tells us not to do to try to get close to God it's is is his own desire right Hallelujah he wants to be H H high and lifted up like the most high he wants his Stars exalted like the most high he want his own church like the most high he want his seed like the most high he wants his music like the most high that's right everything about him Hallelujah he wants to be a replica of your God that's right amen that's right but we look at him he was kicked out of he was kicked out of heaven why because iniquity was found in his heart what is Iniquity iniquity is knowing to do right and do wrong and a lot of times we fall in that category amen we're riding down the road down here and the thing says 100 kilometers and we're thinking 100 miles per hour but it means kilometers so that's something different amen see nor to do right and we still do wrong you know that's iniquity amen and you know we have to Die daily we have to ask God for forgiveness daily so God is giv us a script of continuation God has given us a script where Satan can't keep us in a sinful condition because God gives us a way to repent God gives us a way to make it right God gives us a way where we can stay in his presence amen that's why God is longsuffering because he knows that there's still people who hasn't come full circle yet that belong to him amen hallelujah the grace of God hallelujah is longsuffering because it's not his will that any should perish but that all come to repentance think about it Hallelujah the prophet of God said years ago back in the 60s he said the Rapture should have already taken place think about that he says the Rapture should have already taken place but it couldn't you know why it couldn't because we wern't ready amen amen hallelujah amen we wasn't ready Hallelujah you say Brother D I wasn't born we Wen ready amen hallelujah I wasn't here yet there was a part of me a part of you that had to manifest who God was because only in our day the full word could come the full expression of God and you are a part of that expression so God had to have a continuation of his grace Hallelujah for each and every one of us to grab hold of that word and say now I got it Hallelujah say away with the alcohol away with the lust away with the lying away with the cheating now I got my portion of God now let me reveal it Hallelujah let me be what God has made me H church we are the continuation of William Brown's M we are the continuation of redemption Hallelujah Redemption is a coming out and a going into amen hallelujah Moses Hallelujah had a coming out he was the coming out of redemption but Joshua was the going into Hallelujah John the Baptist was the calling out but Jesus was the going into Hallelujah Elisha was the calling out but Elisha was the going into William bream was the calling out but we that bride are the going into a Redemption Hallelujah we are that Rapture anointing we are that seven seal Church age talking bride of Christ that's right y forgive me I get excited about hallelujah amen see you have to read your Bible you have to study your message because if you don't these things will be forign to you don't just settle with a good church right amen don't just s oh praise God I don't smoke anymore there more to God than just not smoking amen or not drinking amen or not clubbing amen it's a lifestyle Hallelujah and this is one diet if you ever get on it it'll change your [Music] body it'll change you from Mortal to immortality amen it'll change your bones it'll change your heart it'll change your lungs it'll change your eyes and your ears you'll see God and hear God wouldn't you want a diet like that hallelujah thank God for the word but you know church when I look at this I see that Satan he caused the fall amen that's right you know he got into creation but he didn't know and I've been saying this lately Satan is not a SM as you think and I'm going to be bold enough to say you dumb devil because when he got into creation he wanted to mess up God's plan because Adam and Eve were perfect amen they were perfect they knew no sin they knew no wrong they were perfect Adam was created in the image and likeness of God he wasn't like the animal no he had God's mind that's right he had God's personality he had God's Voice Hallelujah Adam had God's Voice Hallelujah when the animals took notice that God was on the Earth where was he in Adam amen and God came and told Adam I want you to name all creation am and you know God wasn't there whispering in his ear that's a that's a that's no God stood off and God just watched his creation operate he watched his mind in Adam operate Hallelujah all right Hallelujah and that's the same thing he's doing today Hallelujah when you become one with God is not God standing over your shoulder no your desires become his desires amen or his should I say his desires become your desires you begin to think and crave what God wants amen amen see that's what I'm saying about this lifestyle amen it's more than just just uh being regular church member right but you're craving God Amen you're seeking God you know that there there there's something about you that won't just it it it won't be satisfied I don't know about y'all but I'm not satisfied amen hallelujah I want to look in his face amen I want to hold his hand you know I I I want to I want to continuously be in his presence amen and until I get there I'll never be satisfied amen amen hallelujah because why why do I have that craving because that's what Adam gave up Hallelujah that's what Adam gave up when Adam committed sin Hallelujah and and and his his whole makeup his whole body hallu went into a metamorphosis it went into a change well he he first originally knew no hurt he knew no pain he knew no depression he knew no sorrow none of those things but sin brought all of that into mankind unbelief brought all of that into Mankind and Satan is sitting there cheering W I did it yes I got him yes man is not a god anymore yes and God is saying you dumb devil you fail to realize by you hallelu doing that getting into creation you just unleash the Plan of Redemption [Applause] hallelujah

enemy the devil you know people always say the devil made me do it you're lying no we won't strip him tonight we going to strip the devil amen you say what the devil made me do the devil is devil that the devil can't make you do nothing you don't want to do he don't have that kind of power whatever you do is because you surrender to do it that's why God put you under free agency the right to do or the right not to do amen so Satan has no the only Power he has is what you surrender to that's why I can sit in the hospital room with cancer in my brain and look straight at them doctors and say I'm healed amen cuz my body have to obey my confession amen Satan is subject to the word that comes out of your mouth Hallelujah so I'm telling you tonight he does not have dominion over you if you don't want him to true now now let's let's let's make sense out of this you can't just live any old kind of way then talking about Satan get out of here no it has to be a Christ centered life amen that's right Hallelujah you have to have a life Hallelujah of submission to the word submission to God Amen that's how the word works in your life that's how you get the power of the scriptures by your submission but if you live in all kind of way and then you trying to speak the word it don't work like that but if you've given your life to God you've given your life to God you have to write you have the right to speak those things that are not as though they are am right Hallelujah that's why Abraham could do it cuz he submitted his life to God to God's way he was marching marching towards the city he know where he was going he was just being directed by God hallelujah amen hallelujah and was God his protection yes he was God was there to fight his battles God was there for everything Hallelujah because he had a life of submission that's why Abraham could speak those things that are not as though they were Amen in the midst of the battle Hallelujah Abraham says I the L goingon to go and I the L gonna come back God didn't tell him that but that was that inspiration in his life that God cannot fail me amen hallelujah then they get up on the top of the mountain Hallelujah and Isaac says Daddy Daddy I see I see I see I see the altar we got the fire would but where's the sacrifice and Abraham Again by inspiration says God will provide himself a l am see when you live that life of surrender God will give you inspiration God will give you a continuation in every situation amen hallelujah to let the devil know you don't have any control Hallelujah am so Church what I'm saying is every situation in the scripture you look every child of God to have continuation amen you take some of the wrong this is a southern word you may not understand this some of the runes that means dirty some of the most filthy people some of the most contaminated lives and it looked like they they were they were nothing those were the people Christ went to Hallelujah Hallelujah that's right he went to the people now I'm about to drop a bomb on you now Christ went to the people hallelujah that the religious church people didn't want to deal with Hallelujah he went to the people that looked like they didn't have a reason for Living God went down to those people hallelujah he went down to that level Hallelujah and spoke the word over their life he went down to that level and God the god of Glory the god of Holiness the god of sanctification allow himself to be touched thank you Lord and the religious people sitting there they invite Jesus to their house Hallelujah and this this this is you know I'm going close I'm going dramatize h a couple situations in the Bible and I'm going close I want you to see this continuation Hallelujah some of the lives that look like they were just completely uh over look like they didn't mean anything Hallelujah and and and and you take huah the woman who was was was a prostitute married H one day she woke up H probably did some crazy stuff that night that that last night she probably did some crazy stuff but this time she woke up and she was sick of who she was Hallelujah can I get amen anybody ever woke up like that that's why I'm where I'm at today cuz I woke up one morning and I was sick of who I was Hallelujah thank you Lord and I say now I'm going to chase after God now I'm going to seek God's face and this lady Hallelujah she heard that Jesus was supposed to go down to Simon's house Hallelujah and she said hey I'm going go take my dirty money and I'm going to go buy an alabaster box think about it Church Hallelujah when she did her lud act that night Hallelujah when she whatever she did in prostitution Hallelujah amen the devil was saying look at her look what she's doing and God was saying to be condemed Hallelujah there's another scene Satan that you don't know nothing about there's another part of her life that hasn't been revealed yet there's another part of her that the world hasn't even seen yet Hallelujah and her time is coming to be continued Hallelujah you know Hallelujah she goes down as a prostitute but she wakes up with a desire Hallelujah amen she wakes up with a desire craving God hallelujah then she went seeking for him amen she found out he was going to be at Simon's house but she didn't just want to go any kind of way she wanted to bring a gift so she went down maybe she went to the pawn shop or she went to some some some great store Hallelujah and maybe sell some white diamond or some some some real nice fancy perfume and all this stuff and she went there and say hey I don't just want one kind of perfume I want a box right amen Hallelujah I want the whole Alabaster Box Hallelujah so she gets the Box amen and now she's she's traveling down hallelujah what I love about at church she was not invited to church that night amen hallelujah amen hallelujah she wasn't invited Hallelujah she was not a member hallelujah what was taking place but she had a longing she had a craving for what Christ could do in her life Hallelujah her life was to be continued but now she had stepped into the scene now she was walking in the vision of what Christ had created for her Hallelujah her continuation became a real life Vision testimony Revelation Hallelujah and now Church she's in the scene Hallelujah no doubt some of you are in the scene right now amen come on somebody talk to me some of you are in the scene some of you are operating in the vision that God has for you and I'm here to tell you don't stop pressing don't stop moving don't get settled down with just a good church building but there's more of God in you to be revealed Hallelujah and you know Church she gets to the house h no doubt she couldn't go through the front door cuz she wasn't as clean as everybody else Hallelujah so she had to go through the back door and Jesus was sitting there you know they didn't they didn't wash his feet they didn't give the attention he deserved as a God but this lady this sinner this prostitute Hallelujah knew that there was something special about him Hallelujah and she Hallelujah tiptoes in Hallelujah she didn't cause a scene Hallelujah she came on in amen and she fell down at jesus' feet took that Alabaster bar took that oil out Hallelujah and she anointed him Hallelujah and then she took the the her hair her tears and she begin to wash his feet and everything and the religious people sitting there looking like that's definitely the like church order brother BR said brother BR said oh no brother BR said amen amen

if there's anything about you you're doing for God it won't break the scriptures hallelujah amen hallelujah it won't bring a reproach to your church either hallelujah amen but Hallelujah it'll be something Hallelujah that'll be So Satisfied Hallelujah it'll make people say man why did I do that and you know Church she Anointed God H she anointed him she she she she pulled the oil on his head Hallelujah and the oil drip down and then she begin to wash his feet and everything and the church people sitting there looking yeah and then they think you got people coming to church Preach preaching who he talking about what are he talking about he too loud he's even sweaty he won't be still I'm tired quit all that moving around y'all know how we have other thoughts while the word is coming cast down imagination focus in on God's voice cuz remember every word has a purpose Hallelujah none of God's word will return to him void but every word has a resting place now catch that church catch that if I'm a true Son of God if I'm an anointed preacher of God every word I said tonight has a purpose in this building everything I've said has a resting place in this building go now

him he wouldn't let her touch it not realizing they're talking about God they're talking about God let me explain something to you what time I know getting late one thing you have to understand about God there's nothing Satan can do got to catch God by surprise amen amen no there's no mistake you can make that makes God say I didn't know they was going to do they made a boo boo there's nothing you can do to make God catch God by surprise the element of surprise doesn't work on God he's all knowing allseeing all powerful amen hallelujah everything about you God already knows amen but the devil wants you to think Hallelujah that oh my you're so condemned and you can never rise above this God already knows Hallelujah and there's nothing that Satan can do that can catch God off God but let me say this anything Satan does anything he's trick you to do God allow amen well that that was a stinger wasn't it think about that Satan doesn't even have control over his over his own trial we ought to be turning these chairs over Hallelujah to know that even the things I'm going through God is in control of even my problems God is in control of amen hallelujah if God allows a sickness he has a purpose in it yes sir Hall if I lose my job God allowed it Hallelujah if me and my my my my my wife has an argument there's a purpose in it God knows about it Hallelujah Satan gets no Glory Hallelujah God knows all about it Hallelujah Satan does not catch him by surprise His Eye Is on the Sparrow hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah see now we ought to look at things different amen you don't believe that well let's look in the Bible the Bible in J in the Book of Job Satan was minding his business he was walking to and fro and God said says hey say what you doing in church hey when com thou he was minding his own business and God initiated the conversation God says hey satan what you doing he said hey I'm walking to and fro you know just trying to mess with somebody life and then God says hey have you considered my servant Jo amen huh you looking for somebody to test my servant Joe Glory Hallelujah God directs him God chooses the person amen and then God tells him how far to go amen that's righten hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Church think about that what you're going through Satan does not have control over it God is allowing it now you need to find out what's Purpose By that's right he tell hey you take his you take his riches you can take his children you can put sickness on his body you can do all that but you can't kill him right and what was the purpose behind all that to get job to glorify God more Hallelujah hallu but you look at this woman with the alabaster box I'm about to close don't get nervous I'm I'm going to close all this up look at the woman she anointing Jesus they looking at her oh man let this Pro Touch perfect SC that's what Christ wanted he wanted them to see that he could change anybody's lifeall he's like y'all don't want to touch me but I'mma let her touch me I'm I'mma let I'mma let her hallelu I'mma let her anoint the word hey Hallelujah you can't just be listening to it you have to anoint the word yes sir and she came and she anointed the word hallelujah now and you you may not cannot pour in the alabaster box on Jesus but you still can anoint the word how do you anoint the word I'm F to tell you you anoint the word by saying am Hallelujah cuz amen means so be it amen means Lord I accept it right now amen hallelujah and if you're really feeling that anointing if you really feeling Hallelujah that anointing over the word hallelujah you can get a double portion with another one hallelujah amen you can say amen and you can also say hallelujah hallelujah cuz Hallelujah is the highest praise that's right Hallelujah and church she gave God the glory she anointed him Hallelujah with the oil and her tears and washing his feet and everything and then she got up and she standing there she's crying and and everything and just feeling so broken and thinking about her life and everything and the church people are criticizing and everything and Jesus tell them be quiet he said let her do what she can do Hallelujah Jesus accepted Hallelujah her tears he accepted her worship he accepted her Glory Hallelujah so what was he doing he was becoming her headship hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and all the glory that she gave to him Hallelujah he gave gave it back to her because church when you look once she anointed the word and she begin to wash his feet with her tears and her hair and all the oil and everything and the anointing and everything where was it it was on her head now the anointing was on her head hallelujah hallelujah Christ had become her covering amen the same anointing she gave came back upon her and when she was walking out Jesus said hey you've done such a good work on me daughter that sin which are many are now forgiven amen hallelujah because she gave God the glory God gave the glory back to her Hallelujah her life was a continuation Hallelujah Church it ain't over I don't care what kind of condition you're in hallelujah hallelujah ho amen hallelujah church this ain't a time to be a bottle of Tylen all three and get all settled down amen but we need to be Shook Up Hallelujah somebody need the doses of Christ in your life amen hallelujah somebody need the medicine of the word hallelujah amen this ain't a time for us to get settled down and say praise God I'm mature now Hallelujah I've been called immature I've been called radical I've been called P cost all these things but they really don't know what's going on you know you see somebody maybe somebody like me who just a little bit different you know a little bit like a wildfire Hallelujah you know what I mean and people look at that and they'll say ah you know he's just so emotional why not I ain't dead God say anything without emotion is dead that's right you can kick a dead person he won't move that's right you can slap him across the face with the Bible he won't move that means he's dead H but if you pinch a person who's alive he's going to say ouch you put his hand in some fire he's going to say you burn me cuz he's alive amen hallelujah and you show me a Holy Ghost Fire I show you a person that's burning Hallelujah H Hallelujah but Church our life is to be cont amen amen it ain't over amen am don't get settled don't say oh we got a church we have such a good pastor than God I just love just so good to us there more things to come am amen how's it going to come you're going to C hallelujah amen yes sir church just for my own personal life the great experience I had with Christ is because I crave amen amen because I seek his face maybe I fast and I prayed and God showed up in a mighty way amen hallelujah hallelujah he still the same God the god of South Carolina is the same God of willing hallelujah amen look death has no control over you amen hallelujah once once life comes death is shattered Hallelujah in life amen cuz you look what can death do death can drive you to Christ see if Satan would have known he think he's so smart but he's really a dumb devil he he he he kills he he kills Naomi's husband he kills Ruth husband right he kills offa's husband what did that do that drove them down to Boaz hallelujah hallu hallelujah hallelujah H you dumb devil hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she got rid of a husband whose name meant sickness and sorrow Hallelujah took him to a kisman redeemer Hallelujah that's what death did Death ran him into the presence of God hallelujah so church that's what Paul would say hallelujah to live is Christ to die is gain huj and that's why death is swallowed up in my victory because if I die to myself I live in christall that's right let me stop cuz I keep going Hallelujah but Church our life is supposed to be a continuation amen that's why you heard the prophet of God say we are supposed to be another book of Acts we're supposed to be the continuation of the Holy Ghost given to the believer and this is what I love what he said he said if that tree ever pushes out another Branch amen yes sir it'll be just like the book amen won't be something different it won't be a bunch of preachers arguing over Doctrine it'll be another book of Acts when you when they when they see us they say man they've been with Jesus Hallelujah that what they did in the book of Acts when they saw man men are ignorant and unlearned Hallelujah the wives don't work the brothers ain't got no good jobs he say but I know one thing they' been with Jesus hallah Hallelujah glory and it say it's a notable Mar Miracle that's taking place this man we know that was blind now he see amen of course they've been with Jesus and we got to be careful how we handle them so Church your life is supposed to be a continuation don't get settled with just living a good life a good nice life right the Muslims do that amen the Buddhist can do that and they can do it better than us right right told me where you go in the airport you see a Muslim woman she's covered from head to toe only thing you can lust after is her nose with this part right here you said man she got a nice looking Bree on her that's the only thing you you they got us beat they got us beating that bar Hallelujah you don't you can't see nothing even a hand come out she got a love over the thing but serving God is more than me amen it's a reality Hallelujah is Christ becoming visible in his children how many know that you're in a continuation how many not going to get settled down with just having a good service amen think about it I I want you I want you to I want you to maybe just think of something you heard tonight and remember that that word cannot go back to God it was spoken in this church what's the name of your church brother what's the name of your church that word was spoken in shakina Tabernacle Hallelujah everything that was spoken is for somebody in here thank you Lord did y'all hear me everything that was spoken was for somebody in cuz it can't go back to God hallelujah until it accomplish what it's supposed to in the believer's Life H now it's up to you on what part you want what part is ordained for you you may walk out no I don't think none of them me I sure wouldn't confess that basically you're confessing you're not a child of God right H the word of God is for everybody H you say even a man in a fallen condition is Son of God Amen well that's kind of tight right there look at me and you say I don't know God I don't have no desire I don't have this that and then he comes back and says even that conditionall what I love about God when I was in the club listening to rap music I still was a Son of God some of you in the bars drinking your B Wiis or your your Coronas or mobes or whatever you were drinking still was a Son of God yes sir you the internet or Facebook putting those pictures up there do all po all still a daughter of [Music] God hallelujah hallelujah Satan cannot change the seat amen hallelujah there comes a time when the continuation becomes a life

pray musicians come hallelujah thank the Lord for having you here being with you Church Let's Take God at his word amen there there there the only reason why we're here is because there's still more of God to be manifest there's still more of God to be revealed hallelujah hallelujah now you need to ask yourself are you doing your portion what I like to say sometimes when I'm preaching messages of faith and I'm challenging the enemy and I'm talking about Goliath you know Goliath he comes and he says bring me a man you know he's standing up and he has everybody all afraid and all scared and everything and the Bible says hallelujah that one of us can chase a thousand amen two of us can chase 10,000 now what I want the Church of Wellington to know about me is that I got my thousand do you got yours Hallelujah I'm going to Chase my thousand every time every opportunity I'm going get I'm going to chase them in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going to let the devil know that I believe God that I believe the word and I'm not turning around Hall I'm going to possess my inheritance Hallelujah now I want to know are you chasing yours Hallelujah because the scripture says two of us can chase 10,000 Hallelujah so it's not up to me to do it all we're a body we got to do it together amen let's pray let's pray bow our heads amen and you know I just want to say tonight as we close our eyes and bow our heads amen let's not look around let's not look at one another but let's just give God reverence amen because he can change your life right here tonight amen if you reverence God God the spirit of the Lord is very timid amen and if you really you really want something from God all you have to do is seek his face all you have to do is say Lord here in I have your way with me let's
