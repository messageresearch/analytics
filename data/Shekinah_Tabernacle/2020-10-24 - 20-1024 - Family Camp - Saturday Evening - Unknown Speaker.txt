========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the lord hello how are you all uh this evening good that's good it's good to be amongst people that are good have you ever worked with someone or been around someone that's negative and all down and it's not overly enjoyable and the longer it goes on the less enjoyable it becomes but praise the lord we are not of that sort because we have hope we have life you know a christian i've always thought a christian you you never go backwards it's like a thing in the world to go backwards you know get old and tired and this and that a christian does not do that because our spirit is alive man it just we just live when and every year we get better and we grow more that's that's the way that it works we don't go down and get negative and tired with life i mean look at brother freddie you know and the other brother what's our other brother's name the brother that's 95 look at him you know you know you get old you get negative you get down you get like that you end up in a rest home and just your life these people are dead well they're alive some of them it's a sad situation brother adam said i'd hate to be crowned when i'm old like a crabby old man and that's that's the crown of my life you know but praise god we don't have to go like that and i've had an enjoyable time so far and you know what i've really enjoyed about these services is that it's all local brethren doing everything i really enjoy it i do i you know it's funny because we are the way that we are the grass is kind of always greener on the other side of the fence you know so we'll see ministers from here overseas and then they'll see in the eminence is here you know we think well this is great you know we could just save a whole lot of money and hey you guys can stay here you guys can stay there [Music] because there's nothing wrong with our guys [Music] i really enjoy the ministry you know i i and i'm not just saying that you know i really do and and that's a part of christianity also is to always be appreciative of what the lord's given always it doesn't matter if you've heard the same guy preach for 40 years week after week appreciate it every week always appreciate it and then the lord will keep blessing us when we when we stop appreciating it and we let our minds slip backwards that's when it all starts to go bad but you know it's like a marriage it always gets better if you put effort in and you always appreciate what you have it always gets better it's when you think the other way that it goes it goes bad who's had a good marriage and ask the question that's no no i mean look now i feel bad some people have you know we all have different we have different trials in different areas of our life you know i've had a lot of trials and testings in my life but marriage has not been one of them that's one area of my life where the lord has just blessed me day in day out and i don't it's not because i've done anything good or anything i'm quite a horrible guy really well no i can't all right i'm not too bad [Applause] but i have a confession to make i wasn't actually going to come to this camp see sister naomi says you always not the friesian says you always say weird things and then when you explain it it makes sense sometimes i'll tell you why not because i didn't want to come but this is actually today this day

lord and to be with a brethren so and i don't regret it i'm having a great time here but thanks shane for sticking with me [Music] [Applause] i'm gonna ask um i'm gonna ask brother marty if he'll come

you may just take your seats for a minute thank you the the worship there i am i came at the back there and with the bend scene and when the kubin seen how nervous and shaky i was and i just came to stand at the back there with isaac and i just started entering in with the worship and with the praise and i feel settled not as nervous i'm still nervous not as nervous as i i was earlier god bless you strange to have me standing here um with his brother adrian gray and both freddie seasoned senior ministers of the gospel and you am i but i'm just so thankful to almighty god i know us i was thinking earlier i was telling my wife i feel like i'm out of my league but i'm thankful that i have got confidence in god all i want to do is just step out of the way the ben thank you um when i when i got your message i was i was sitting in bed email came through i read it i started shaking i called for freddy and then just often you had also contacted my friend as well and he was shaking father why is he shaking him [Applause] i actually ended up crying because i thought why lord how could you choose me but god knows and i believe tonight i need to be here there's there's too many things that has been happening since since the lord laden brother ben's heart to contact me there's too many things that's been happening and too many consolations in fact as just before the meeting i got a text message from brother stephen milam and he said i'm praying for you and he gave me a scripture and that is the scripture that i'm going to read tonight so i know god is in control so as we stand to our feet amen just if you can just open your bibles um i've got uh just three scriptures the first scripture i want to read is in the book of romans chapter 8 and verse 13 is just a simple scripture and then we'll go over into the book of joshua and brother adrian touched on caleb and joshua this morning so just romans chapter 8 13 it says for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body you shall live and if we could turn over to the book of joshua i love the book of joshua i see myself in the book of joshua so just joshua chapter 1 and then we'll go to joshua chapter 3 as well just joshua 1. now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people and to the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i have said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of my life and mother stephen milam gave me this scripture he said as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail uh fail thee nor forsaken joshua chapter three let's just read the first five verses it says in joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priest the levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it for verse 4 yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cupid's by measure come not near unto it that you may know um the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way yet um year four verse five says and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourself for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you father we've read your word lord i'm available to you the people already so lord jesus take control jesus name amen and amen amen god bless you may be seated this morning in the presence of almighty god hey man i was just thinking i i think i might have mentioned it sometime in the last camp we were here i was thinking of camps that i used to attend as a young person and it's just always been awesome experiences it was and you i'll probably speak about it on tomorrow night but it was at a camp like this where god came and it changed my life completely so i was thinking of camps and i would i remember i was i was i was at a a camp one year and uh the the the atmosphere was electrifying like it is here we we knew that god was inaudible and i remember that day ferdi was was i think you were doing the song service and and at the end of the meeting ferdi came and he says now you're going to your bungalows but be ready be under expectation because god is going to meet you in your bungalows you know a lot of times we have this perception that it's only in a gathering a church gathering where god meets you so ferdi said those words and we all went to our bungalows i ended up falling asleep in my bungalow and then round about probably the middle of the night we heard knocking on our bungalow doors and then we got up what's happening and then we heard that said god is moving amongst the sisters in the bungalows and i remember jumping out of bed getting dressed with my brother-in-law gerard the two of us and we ran to the sisters area and i remember coming as i was walking i seen it was like it was like the the way the bundles were situated was sort of like in a semi circle and i remember coming and walking and i seen people on their knees on the grass it's dark people on their knees crying out to god and i remember coming then i i stepped into an atmosphere and as i stepped in that atmosphere i just felt myself dropped to my knees and i said lord you are still the same yesterday today and forever i said lord what you did for me at that camp you can do yeah amongst the people of god [Applause] so i'm not much on titles but the title that i want to give to you today is prepare yourself today for tomorrow or later the lord will do great wonders amongst you and within you that's my title and it's not just a title i believe it's something that's going to happen and it's already happening [Applause] and what inspired me for this title and i wrote it down here i said this weekend is my weekend this camp is for me i will receive what i came for i love that song that the choir sang i won't let you go until you bless me let that be your attitude over this weekend lord i won't let you go i need a change in my life i will receive what i came for but the chris yesterday told me he says by the test i'm hungry and the word of god says blessed are they which hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be full that's the word of almighty god and the word of god does not lie the word of god does not fail so if you're hungry and if you thirst god is going to meet you he's going to fool you he's going to give you what you need in the message just once more lord brother branham says then samson cried out lord they poked my eyes out i know that you are god i know that you have the power to do it i know you can set me free from these fitters a lot of times we find even in message churches people walking around in fitness pounds circumstances situations he says i know you can set me free from these fitness with the premises just once more lord just once more and then he says just once more lord just once more let there be a camp meeting on the side of the hill now i'm saying my words let there be a camp meeting in the forest lakes in forest lakes in otaki [Applause] and brother branham says like there was on the hill at the up room let there come a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind full of the house visible evidence of the resurrected christ visible evidence you heard that quoted right i quote it visible evidence of the resurrected christ visible evidence seen in you and in me you overcoming what whatever situation you face name it whatever it is i believe that the god that we serve is awesome and i believe if you haven't yet experienced it you're going to see the visible evidence of the resurrected lord jesus christ in your individual life is that what you want because if that's what you want and you have that desire in your heart he's going to give it to you yes mother andy i believe that because i've experienced it in my i'm not just talking stuff [Applause] but yeah i'm not just saying things to make you happy or to excite you i'm speaking things that i know what i'm talking about i've experienced a loving god a loving reality a god that has taken me from wherever i was and it's taken me higher and higher and he's helped me to overcome [Music] he's given me the ability to say no when i must say no [Applause] you struggle to say no he is able to help you to say no forgive me i'm just me right i'm not i'm not off ready i'm not brother ben i'm not any other minister i'm just who god made me to be and i i believe that that it's just standing in your position it doesn't matter what it is whether it's a plumber whether it's the person that greets the believers you know how powerful it is at that person at the back that welcomes the people here if that person stands at the back and we come in and he just wish you how would we enter the church so i thank the lord for my lovely [Applause] precious i love the lord it's done so much for me i cannot tell it oh jesus there's no way i am so this this text now i struggled as i was preparing this because i wasn't sure how to present it and uh i had to tell myself and this was the other thing that brother stephen milam sent me he says in the book of jeremiah don't look at the faces of people but i'm looking at your faces because i can see that you love the lord and i can see that you want more of him but i i struggled a bit um with sort of the the theme of of of of what we're going to the lord is going to uh do today but as the weeks and the days went by i see god just dropping little tidbits of consolation along the way and saying this you go ahead you go ahead and that's what i need to do tonight now in this in this um as i said i love i just love the book of joshua amen now in in the passage uh joshua one two and three um these were people that walked that were walking and they promise joshua 1 says 1 3 says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you they were walking under a promise so as they were walking there was promises hanging over them there shall not be there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of my life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake me these were people walking under a promise they were walking under a promise of a new land they were walking under a promise of my inheritance is in that land and i believe you and i are no different we are a people walking under great and precious promises promises of perfection promises of adoption promises of a body change promises of spoken word reality now these people they had to so in joshua chapter 3 we find them coming to a place called jordan and it's there where god places them for a season now there was a requirement on the end that they needed to do before crossing over jordan and i read it in joshua 3 5 where it says joshua said unto the people sanctify yourself for tomorrow the lord will do wonders amongst you now they had to go through a process of sanctification now sanctification it's about dedicating yourself sanctifying consecrating yourself brother branham would take it and place it with her he'd say it's like a gloss a dirty gloss that's laying somewhere in the muck and the maya maybe you want me that dirty gloss and brother platinum would take it and say it's about picking that gloss up dirty gloss cleaning it out and sitting at the side for service so brother branham identifies and he talks a little bit about sanctification and then so the promise to them was sanctify yourself for tomorrow god is going to do wonders amongst you so i just wrote here i added in another word to that scripture and forgive me for doing that but just just to put things in perspective um i wrote you i said sanctify yourself today for tomorrow now tomorrow might not be the when the sun rises might just be in the next couple of minutes it might be during this meeting for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you so they had to do something in preparation for some wonderful things that was going to happen now i know that this message is not a message of sanctification i know that but just just allow me just to just touch a bit on this i remember a couple of years ago and i might have mentioned this at some assembly i'd preach in i remember a couple of years ago there was a brother a younger brother his family of mine a younger brother that i had an altercation with we said some things had some words and then stopped talking to each other i was living in london brother was living in south africa so not talking to each other was okay because we were far apart the lord then arranged things that i ended up visiting south africa and going to a convention in fact it was a camp it wasn't a youth camp it was a camp like this and i remember sitting in that meeting oh man i was so excited the lord's gonna do great things for me and he did but i had to do something first and i sat at the back but i was under expectation and the god moved man i see now he was dealing with individuals and i had my hands in the air and i was trying to force what i want more of you but i felt empty i just felt there was something blocking me from from breaking through it's just something awesome [Applause] but there was something stopping me [Music] from breaking through and then the lord laid on my heart in the meeting and said tez you want more of me his name is dalton daniels dalton is in the same meeting you want to move on with me you're gonna make right with dalton i said no lord it wasn't me he's the he's younger than me anyway he must come to me because i'm the senior but the lord told me this if you if you want more of me test if you really want more of me this is going to be the test to prove if you really want more of me you're going to ah what's the word you're going to even if you're gonna be standing with egg on your face you're gonna have to make right to that brother whether you think the brother did you wrong you go and make right so while everyone was just entering in i slipped out in the back and i got someone to call by the delta and my dalton came to me and i said mr dalton you know this thing between me and you i said the delton i'm sorry hallelujah i said brother dalton forgive me you know what it wasn't just words because i wanted more of god i desired so much of god i said mr dalton i'm so sorry i said valentine heaven means more to me than this little bitty stuff and then we ended up holding each other hugging each other today by the dalton is one of my best buddies in fact in fact you might even be listening to the live stream right now but you know what happened after that i came into the meeting and i was felt so light i stood i i like to sit on the edge so i stood at the edge and all i remember was i raised my hands that's what i remember when i opened up my eyes i found myself laying here at the altar and i walked out of that meeting knowing that god had taken me a level higher worth him because that is what we as christians do we go higher [Applause] we don't stand and mark time we don't stay on one place all the time but we're moving forward we need to cross over if you haven't and we need to possess what is house what is mine [Applause] i am sick and tired of the devil messing around with the children of god it's time we take a stand as the devil enough is enough i just love the lord i can't explain myself oh thank you now we know we've been taught well by the message of the message that has come our way and believers don't ever ever ever ever underfell you don't undervalue what you and i have you and i we've got something that is so precious we've got something that is more precious than gold young people don't allow the enemy to take that away from you you fight for what is yours you know he makes the state when he says ephesians parallels joshua and i'm not going to go into those things i'll leave that for for the adrian gray and porfredi and all the big shot ministers but i just want to just say that for a reason because if you look at the book of joshua and you look at the warfare it's with a sword and they're just cutting cutting and killing and if you go into the book of ephesians there's also a warfare but it's a spiritual warfare if you look in the book of joshua there's a physical armor that they had to put on in the book of ephesians this is spiritual honor if you look at the book of joshua there's a physical land that they had to go in and possess brother branham says in the message adoption number one he says now what is the land promised to the new testament believers you and me and then he answers that he says the promise is the holy spirit i believe that now he says here he says but the believers now like i like this terminology he says but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit i like it i like the caleb and joshua outfit he identifies the caleb and joshua outfit as the believer as you and me and if you go and look at caleb and joshua there the their approach the way they handle things they didn't look at the problem they looked so the problem was there they looked there at the promise of god that said you are more than able that's me i'm freddie the caleb and joshua outfit okay but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and they took the land and settled down in the land as a possession so they went over into the land if you read the book of joshua they had to go in they sort of went into the land but they still had to fight to dispossess whatever squatters was on their land now brother branham says um they moved him over over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we never stop at justification and we know these things right we never stop at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus christ now he's not saying don't believe in the lord jesus he says don't stop thee he says being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin now i've discovered that in my hawk as a christian and dealing with different people he said god comes and he cleanses that person up it turns their life around and then they think that's okay and then they go back off the camp and they go back to their homes but they're not seeking more of god they're not seeking the baptism of the holy ghost because you see once you get emptied out something needs to follow that void so we find many times god does something amazing but they stop there go back home and the first little floozy that comes or the first little temptation that comes they crumble and they fall it's because they never went all the way so i want to encourage you tonight i believe that this ground this campground is holy ground i believe that with all my heart i believe we surround it by angels this weekend and this forest lakes camp has been set aside for you and for me [Music] so when you leave here on monday make sure that you've gone all the way don't just stop your ministers your brothers that can help you work with you lead you in fact i think in the holy ghost is where the band talks about ministers that has got the holy ghost he says those let them lead you go talk to them in the messenger personal experience with god what we need today is a good old-fashioned saint paul's revival and the baptism of the holy ghost like fell on the day of pentecost to bring a people back to a living faith in god again he says i believe in confessions to raise up and accept jesus that's good and i believe it's important but he says i believe we need something more than that and just one last quote before i go to my notes but the brand says here in the adoption number one he says did you notice joshua before they cross jordan joshua said go through the midst of the camp clean your clothes sanctify every one of you for within three days you'll see the glory of god then brother madam says see it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise so there is a process that god has given us so that we can move forward and we know justification sanctification oh we know these things i just want to drop this in and this might seem like you know very low down there but i believe it's so important on the day of pentecost peter came with a prescription on what you and i need to do to receive the baptism of the holy ghost what did he say acts 2 38 he says repent that's a very important step repent repent means to abort and hate persons repent is about change that's going to happen in your life peter says repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the baptism the promise of the holy ghost now there's anyone here tonight there's a pool outside but don't just go to be baptized if you haven't time step number one i do repentance i remember brother branham was was um dealing with a woman i think she was alcoholic and uh you said okay let's pray and this woman she went up the knees and she said a prayer and she got up there she said by the panel i feel good i feel i can go on now for our prophet with discernment he discerned the situation and he said ah you haven't done it right and then brother branham says let's pray again and go go go to the message and just like let's pray again let's play again and then she prayed again and then when she prayed again brother branham says she struck something [Applause] i want to encourage you today let's strike something this weekend [Applause] if you haven't struck it yet yesterday or this morning you can strike it today [Applause] don't put it off for tomorrow don't wait until tomorrow do it today now the bible says that the jordan so they were camping at the jordan they needed to go over to the other side because their possession their inheritance was on the other side let's just watch god god blesses them they read the scriptures for three days three days you let them camp at jordan now but the brandon says just talks a little about the disease and as i was with moses he says that jordan was three or four times its size he says spooky looking but joshua said god said within three days we're going over and we are going over the joshua and caleb outfit joshua seen the jordan like everyone else in the jordan but joshua didn't look at the problem brother andy he looked at the promise of god [Applause] now that jordan and i'm going to steal i i spoke on this little bit sometime back in freddy said as you inspired me i want to preach on the sermon and title it that river so let's talk about that river that river overflowing and that level was probably looking at them [Applause] you're gonna crush me and they the children of israel were probably on the other side maybe there were some unbelievers looking at the river now we know there were rocks in the river as well so maybe there was some rocks that were standing up and the river was flowing and smashing the rocks and the people that look some unbelievers or make believers would look are we going to cross that but you should god place them there for three days he placed them there for three days because he wanted them to see it's not about their abilities but it's about god and god alone [Applause] amen so the lord let them stay there for three days now we know the other side of the story well forgive me it's not a story story is fictional this is an event that happened now we know that and we go there how they overcame the jordan but before overcoming they probably stood there and the jordan was just mocking them how many of us today might be facing our jordans situations that seem so big so difficult to overcome you know last week last week we as a family we received some devastating news i've got a sister that's 37 years old and she came to us to tell us that she's been diagnosed with what they call triple negative cancer now i have no idea what that means and yes as a family we've never ever had to experience cancer in our family and yeah i'm a son of god and yet i receive that news i had one of two choices i could have just said okay mr cancer but the god inside of me is telling me that this might be your jordan that's that's telling you there's no way that you're gonna pass me now i believe my sister's healing is on the other side but that jordan right now of triple negative cancer is standing and looking us at us as a family and saying there is no way i'm gonna let you pass me but i i'm praying in my heart and i'm saying lord this is a journey that that you've placed before me i have total confidence in god yes sometimes the flesh feels the way the flesh feels but i am saying lord i don't know where this journey is going to take us as a family one thing i do know it's going to draw us closer to you but lord help me me because you know sometimes we can just do our thing and god didn't tell you to do it but you just do your thing and then you mess up and then you come back as lord away sometimes it's your own doing so we go back you see it says here joshua they overcame the jordan how did they overcome the jordan brother branham says but the branham says he overcame the jordan by putting the word first he put the word ahead of him [Music] but the plan says watch what did what what joshua did he did he put the clergy first no he put the word first brother branham says get behind it what situation might you be facing now get behind the word [Music] don't you try to lead the world let the word lead you you see joshua's first campaign he put first things first and that was the word of god and that is my plan of action for this triple negative cancer i am putting the word first and i'm saying lord you lead and let the word do it for you let the word do it for you see it doesn't matter who you are forgive me for saying this it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter even how anointed you might say you are doesn't matter how awesome the gift is in your life if you don't put the word first those things just it's just silly stuff the word is the ultimate if you put the word first he will guide you he will lead you he will show you what you need to do with your jordan put the word first now across there jordan once they've done their process of sanctification and they followed the word we find out that when they followed the instructions of the word and they went into that jordan the jordan had to be obedient the jordan had to obey and we know what happened the jordan opened up because you see they had to get over to the other side because on the other side joshua had to meet up with the captain of the host of the lord they needed to have their victory at jericho they needed to have their victory at a.i and the defeat at ai now a lot of times now i'm going to hopefully finish soon a lot of times you know with with with joshua chapter seven i think we always tend to look at a.i and we look at aiken and we look at sin in the camp which is a very important principle but the book of hosier talks about you know when when when aiken had to when they had to make things right it was done in the valley of a core and the bible says in the book of hosea chapter 2 verse 15 it calls the valley of echo a door of hope i look at that and i say why is that the door of hope and i look at it and i say lord it shows me that lord maybe we might have done things so bad so wrong but father as long as we make right the wrong we can move on in victory so i read that hosea 2 15 we had caused the calls the value of acor as a door of hope tells me that yes maybe i fail god maybe i make mistakes but i can come to him and i can say lord i need victory but lord you told me i need to do this father you told me i need to do that lord i'll do it because heaven means so much more to me than this pretty silly stuff so for this children of israel sanctification was part of their process to their promise brother branham says here in the adoption series 3 he says jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 men was to take the gospel to the world and he said for their sake i sanctify myself and then brother branham goes on make yourself meaning sanctify yourself for your neighbor's sake he says for somebody else's sake now why are you at this weekend's meetings you hear for yourself obviously you want more of god but i know that many of us are here for others as well we've got a burden for our loved ones we've got a burden for our husbands for our wives for our children for our neighbors brother branham says make yourself for your neighbors sick for somebody else's sake don't use your liberty for a cloak said paul but sanctify yourself and then brother branham goes on he says behave yourself in the neighborhood so when your neighbors see you what's their testimony behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real christian auto let your communication be says if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for your sake your enemy someone has maybe done terrible things to you sanctify yourself for his sake and i'm not just saying these things i've gone through this i needed to do it he says if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do then brother ram talks about the adoption and he says first thing after the sun was in he become a son but then we find out his behavior is what set him to adoption whether he behaved right or not now the musicians can come and i'm going to just read a couple of scriptures and then i'm going to read a quote and then we'll finish and musicians can just play something soft we know brother brandon talks about jordan and he talks about death to self he talks about dying to self and i used to sit in meetings many times as a young person and i would hear these words die to self a lot of times i just didn't understand but i must die to self the lord just told me to read a couple of scriptures today and if maybe you identify with any of the scriptures if while the scripture is read and then this something is just respond to god [Music] i'll just read the scriptures and i read a quote now the devil has a way sometimes of trying to expose you [Music] and his objective for wanting to expose you is for all the wrong reasons [Music] he wants to show you up [Music] but god has got a different objective when he exposes you because he wants you if he shows you certain things in your life his objective is not to show you his objective is to let you come up higher his objective is for you to come to realization of who you are [Music] so as i'm going to read the scriptures [Music] and if the holy ghost is exposing it maybe in your life or my life it's because he wants you to come up higher that's the reason for this camp he wants you and me to walk out this on monday knowing that we had a definite experience with a supernatural god and that when something comes my way tomorrow something happened amen [Music] and that i'll be able to stand whether i'm the out alone [Music] so i want to encourage you i'm not going to work up emotions right because emotions are weak emotions is weak i've been through all of those things i've experienced but i just want you to just come to that reality with god and i want to ask you just be brutally honest just be honest that's what he wants he wants honesty [Music] i have to be honest i had to go to dalton i'm sorry just read you the scriptures and remember the reason god just told me to read the scriptures reading this in the message church people might say why are you reading this in the message church i don't know god told me to read it so i'm going to read it ephesians 4 25 says now we're going to expose spirits because these are demons it's demons and that demon can go but the venom says in the church of the living god lays the power to overcome [Music] i believe that authority is here today [Music] and if you really want to move on with god you know what you must do now i'm not saying come to the altar if you want to come [Music] it's as the lord leads you but you allow god [Music] to deal with you don't listen to my voice listen to the voice behind my voice which is speaking to you a lot of times we talk about the young people young people young people [Music] a lot of times the young people needs this but a lot of times us older people we need this as well ephesians 4 25 says wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor if there's a lion demon it can go let him that steel or stone still no more now it's not only stealing from the shop it's stealing your boss's time it's stealing from god let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth let nothing be done through strife or vainglory it's all about me [Music] ii timothy 3 says for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemous disobedient to parents now a lot of times again we put that on the young people what about us as old and our parents how do we treat them unthankful unholy and the big thing that's happening now without natural affection [Music] through springs false excuses fierce despises of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure times [Music] [Music] now brother branham says in the message enticing spirits and go close here now let's lay aside every weight you see you've got a template you've got something about you and makes you talk when you ought not to talk brother branham says oh god lay it there now lay it before god he says lay it there watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away that can happen today and then later after this meeting you can move on with god [Music] he says watch the love of god lick it up so lord i got a lying spirit too lord i've got this problem with pornography which is quite big [Music] especially amongst message young people lord i've got a problem with pornography the brandon says watch not the wrath of god watch the love of god [Music] he wants to help you he wants to help me watch the love of god lick it up watch all that old selfishness the the way you've been talking to your wife you know these are simple things where you've been talking to your wife wives the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you've talked about people in the church but the pronunciation lay it on the altar and the fire of god will come down and take it right away [Music] he says divine love will burn in its place [Music] as we just bow our heads tonight [Music] lord jesus you laid this burden on my heart [Music] father i believe that i was obedient even though lord jesus as i was saying earlier i had big battles within myself to speak this lord father because you you love us so so much you want us to walk in victory you want us to have our jericho victories you want us oh god to to to move over god and defeat ai you you want us my god to move over and claim what is ours lord our individual inheritance in the promised land [Music] but sometimes there are things oh god that we realize that we need to do [Music] and father if there's no one in this meeting that needed to hear this i believe you gave this to me because there is someone that needed to hear this maybe in the archives maybe right now on live stream lord you know who you are so i just want to pray tonight oh god i say thank you lord just for allowing me just to [Music] avail myself and allow you to [Music] speak with god what you wanted spoken tonight meet with everyone father and help us to prepare to make things right to do what we need to do because we're walking out of these meetings [Music] in victory lord bless each and every individual that's here lord god if you as a samson maybe father maybe the samson has my god just given his or her strength to you but given his or her heart somewhere else like samson of all that cried out once more lord let them individually cry out once more lord [Music] i need you [Music] you say thank you jesus name let's just allow the music plays and let's just close our eyes let's just bathe for a few moments in his presence and if there's anyone you you you you you know that god has spoken to your heart [Music] he's maybe highlighted certain things that needs to be dealt with [Music] you can pray but if you're not able to pray on your own you are able brothers that can pray with you that can pray you through it's like brother branham told that woman pray again you see maybe that woman just said a prayer but she didn't pray a prayer [Music] let's just allow god for a few moments [Music] i think the song leader was to just sing something just softly as you just lift up your hearts lift up your hands [Music] you know if you've never if you've never lifted up your hands before to god [Music] you know today can be a different day all you need to do is defy gravity [Music] and just lift up your hand [Music] and say lord i surrender i surrender to you lord i surrender my will my passions [Music] the desires i have i give it to you you take me father help me and strengthen me make your heart your altar [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] back let yourself [Music] uh [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you chose me to be the one that you would die for the one that you saved the one that you would care for the one that you would raise the one that you will see [Music] every way [Music] your head and was [Music] your body shoulders [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] when [Music] [Applause] [Music] the one that you would raise the one that you would see through [Music] every way [Music] [Music] yes [Music] oh the one that you tell [Music] the one that you would care for the one that you would raise the one that you would see through every story every way you chose me you chose me [Music] oh you chose me [Music] oh you chose me hallelujah hallelujah glory to god thank you jesus thank you chose me lord hallelujah thank you you carried my sin on your shoulders lord glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Music] shamga take your ox guard kill the philistines shamga they've come season after season why not end it why not end it shangri realized he was a circumcised son of abraham and that was enough the prophet said he didn't become one he was one and then he realized i'm a son of abraham this is my land i'm not letting this enemy take this from me no more the cycle is gonna break it's gonna break right now so i say shamga take your ox coat go go out and go back then come back again and go out and come back again break the cycle the cycle breaker is here i don't need to tell you that you know he's present you give a full surrender that thing that's been holding on to your life you say i'm done i've drawn my line in the sand i'm over this i'm over you devil i'm done jesus paid it all to him i owe sinner left a guilty stain but he has made me white as snow hallelujah to god why not in the cycle it's in your power it's not the devil's power it's your decision he has to obey your decision it's time we recognize who we are who we are right now kill one after another after another he said there's a lot of demons on my case he killed one and then number two number three number four then eventually number 600 was dead and the cycle was over our jesus is here why not come break the cycle why not make a line in the sand you make your decision god will take you in your decision he'll back it up not because of emotion because of a revelation i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god hallelujah this may be a bad time to read a scripture but i just gotta i want to read a scripture i heard this on the way to camp it says in jeremiah 49 concerning the amorites thus saith the lord hath israel no sons hath he no heir why then does their king in here gand and his people dwell in his cities i say has has this message no sons has our lord jesus no sons and daughters he does and they're in this room hallelujah i'd say i'm one of them hallelujah so why does the devil stay on our ground he has no right to stay on your ground if it's your children if it's your family and it's your personal life if it's drugs whatever it is that holds you back you say i'm a son or daughter of god but because i say i am because his word says i look am the problem and look at the promise our jesus is here he'll fight your battle and say i can't meet this devil you can't but he can he already did that down calvary when he was hanging his head it is finished and it was finished and then after that moment he just manifested his victory down through seven churches and now he's here in the bright age to manifest the final victory hallelujah you say well i'm not worthy forget you look at him he has made you worthy you just have to accept it [Music] hallelujah i'd say jesus i accept it thank you jesus thank you i'm free indeed thank you the cycle's broken thank you there's
