[27:20] blessings Lord just be with us in the
[27:22] race of the meeting Lord we ask you this
[27:24] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen
[27:27] thank you
[27:30] amen God bless you Saints God bless
[27:37] you
[27:39] amen let's read um the scripture here in
[27:43] Ephesians
[27:44] 6 it's a scripture that everyone knows
[27:49] the armor of
[27:51] God
[27:53] verse 6 um no chapter 6 verse 12 it says
[27:58] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[28:01] blood but against principalities against
[28:03] Powers against the rulers of the
[28:06] darkness of this world against spiritual
[28:08] weakness in high places wherefore take
[28:12] unto you the whole armor of God that ye
[28:15] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[28:19] and having done all to stand and now
[28:21] verse 16 above all taking the shield of
[28:25] Faith wherewith ye shall be able to
[28:28] quench all the fiery Dart of the wicked
[28:31] amen you can have your
[28:34] seat when so the Lord put this thought
[28:36] in my heart like when I was supposed to
[28:39] preach like I don't know like one month
[28:40] ago or something but I got caught up in
[28:42] the traffic for like two hours and we
[28:45] triy with
[28:47] Stephanie to meet in the middle but she
[28:49] got stuck in the traffic too and with
[28:52] the babies at the back so I just said to
[28:53] her just turn around and brother Ben
[28:56] took the meeting that night so that
[28:58] that's my excuse for last
[29:01] Mee so I want to talk to you tonight
[29:04] about constant battle as Christians we
[29:07] having a constant battle every single
[29:10] day and I would say like from the day
[29:12] that you get baptized you are choosing
[29:14] as side you are saying I'm standing on
[29:17] this side I believe Lord Jesus I'm in
[29:19] this Army so the devil look at you and
[29:22] says okay empo you are on the you're on
[29:26] the wrong team now for the devil but we
[29:29] know that we're in the right him amen
[29:32] amen so from that very
[29:35] moment you are like signing the
[29:38] declaration of war amen against Satan
[29:41] that's
[29:43] right and we know that we are going to
[29:46] win the battle because of our Lord Jesus
[29:49] Christ praise the Lord amen but there's
[29:52] many many little battles that
[29:55] probably we're going to fail but we're
[29:58] we're going to stand and we're going to
[29:59] stand again and if we fall we're going
[30:01] to stand because we trust in the Lord
[30:04] amen so like a secondary subject I want
[30:07] to talk also about perception right
[30:11] because we have faith that's the sixth
[30:14] sense that the lord gave us but we also
[30:16] have five senses that help us to connect
[30:18] to this realm to this world yeah and um
[30:22] perception in Google says that is the
[30:24] ability to see hear or become aware of
[30:28] of something through the senses yeah
[30:33] amen so even though we know that these
[30:36] senses are like very very good they're
[30:39] like me top your eyes can see like I
[30:42] don't know in how
[30:44] many how how do you call that thing for
[30:46] the cameras megapixels or something
[30:49] pixels we can see like way better than
[30:51] the cameras we can hear so much with
[30:55] those senses they can trick us yeah yeah
[30:58] Hallelujah that's right so here we have
[31:00] two examples like if you put a pencil
[31:02] inside of glass with water it's going to
[31:06] look that it's bent because it's just
[31:08] the reflection of the light in the water
[31:09] yeah so your eye even though it's a very
[31:12] good eye it can get tricked yeah that's
[31:16] right also when you are driving oh sorry
[31:19] when you are driving and you can see
[31:20] like there is full with water and as you
[31:22] drive you see that the water is just
[31:24] moving and moving and there's actually
[31:27] no water yeah it's just um a mirage that
[31:33] thing thank you
[31:35] brother now here in India they have like
[31:39] a story about people being blind but
[31:43] they were all touching an elephant yeah
[31:45] the person that was touching the
[31:47] elephant by the tail probably he thought
[31:49] man this is a
[31:50] rope the other one that was touching the
[31:52] body man this is a wall yeah the other
[31:55] one that was touching the ear this is a
[31:57] fan the other one that was touching the
[32:00] leg this is a tree the other one
[32:02] touching the the Tusk that's you call
[32:04] this is a spear and the other one
[32:07] touching the trunk thought there was a
[32:10] snake but if you put everything together
[32:13] is that how you can get the reality of
[32:15] the thing yeah but if you just look
[32:17] under your own perception you can get
[32:22] trick that's why God giv us to us give
[32:26] to us faith
[32:28] which is this six sense amen Hebrews uh
[32:32] Hebrews 111 says now Faith is the
[32:34] substance of things hoped for the
[32:37] evidence of things not
[32:39] seen what a beautiful thing yeah so here
[32:43] we have shedrach Mish in aedo in the
[32:47] fiery
[32:47] fness what what they were able to see it
[32:51] was fire what they were able to
[32:54] smell like something burning while they
[32:58] were able to hear something crackling it
[33:00] was very
[33:02] hot that was the sensus but what face
[33:06] told them you can get out of here
[33:08] hallelujah I'm going to be with you and
[33:10] that's why they just jumped there they
[33:13] knew that was something
[33:15] else another example here says um Moses
[33:19] by faith Moses when he was come to years
[33:23] refused to be called the son of
[33:25] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[33:27] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[33:30] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[33:33] season steaming the reproach of Christ
[33:36] greater riches than the treasures in
[33:38] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[33:40] recompense of the
[33:43] reward
[33:45] man I really wouldn't say that I can
[33:49] have the same Faith the Moses had in
[33:52] that moment reject everything Egypt was
[33:55] like the main country in the world and
[33:57] he reject
[33:58] everything what you just you reject your
[34:01] um let's say what's the coolest thing
[34:04] now like Xbox or something your fancy
[34:07] room all your lights and everything just
[34:09] to receive some whips right right what
[34:13] of you man that that's Faith he saw that
[34:18] the Lord was greater than that
[34:19] Hallelujah and all of this it was just
[34:21] going to get to an
[34:23] end now I wanted to put a picture of of
[34:26] me when I went
[34:28] to like to kindergarten and then to
[34:31] school and then to high school and then
[34:32] to the uni cuz I was surrounded by
[34:34] friends and I thought by the time man
[34:37] this these guys are I'm my friends
[34:41] yeah I haven't talked to any of them for
[34:45] years wow I haven't talked to my friends
[34:49] that they were in the high school but I
[34:50] thought back in the days their opinion
[34:53] about me was so important yeah yeah but
[34:56] now that I'm 30 years old
[34:59] that was just nothing was there for a
[35:01] couple of years and that's nothing y I
[35:04] haven't talked to friends from high
[35:05] school then I thought man now these guys
[35:07] they are very important another one from
[35:09] the school that kids but now these guys
[35:12] now we I have 15 something like that I
[35:15] haven't talked to them and from the uni
[35:17] there is only one guy that I still
[35:19] talked to only one out of all my friends
[35:22] all those opinions about me that I
[35:25] thought they were so important
[35:27] I just don't care anymore yeah
[35:30] so if you can take that
[35:33] kid so now we can see
[35:36] Moses and what what was Moses able to
[35:39] see the Red Sea and the Pharaoh
[35:43] approaching what he was able to listen
[35:45] the horses the
[35:48] sea but what fate told him yeah just
[35:53] speak and as I
[35:55] spoke we can see what happened
[35:58] amen because Faith was given to us to
[36:02] trust in the Lord amen amen another
[36:05] example here we have um Noah it says by
[36:09] faith Noah being warn of God of things
[36:12] not seen as yet move with fear prepare
[36:15] an ark to be saving of his house by the
[36:18] which he condemned the world his faith
[36:21] condemned the world Amen and became hair
[36:24] of the righteousness which is by faith
[36:27] amen that's also in um Hebrews 11 now
[36:32] can you imagine building something never
[36:36] seen before yeah for something that was
[36:40] never ever ever happened before rain
[36:42] wasn't a thing yeah what was he able to
[36:46] see well there's no rain but the Lord
[36:48] told me that was going to be a big big
[36:51] 40 days of rain so he prepared the ark
[36:55] not
[36:58] not like trusting in his senses just in
[37:01] his faith amen and I think that's a
[37:04] little bit of us yes sir I like to think
[37:07] that every time that's right I'm driving
[37:09] up the transmission G I'm like man I
[37:13] trust the Lord amen I trust the Lord by
[37:16] faith all these families that
[37:19] travel they're doing it by faith they're
[37:22] they fully trust that the Lord is going
[37:24] to bless them and he's going to take
[37:26] them out of here one day
[37:29] amen now let's go back here verse 16 of
[37:33] Hebrews 11 no um Ephesians 6 says above
[37:37] all that's very important because it's
[37:39] like saying take all these things but
[37:42] above
[37:43] all taking the shield of Faith wherewith
[37:46] ye shall be able to quench all the Fier
[37:48] dots of the wicked yeah amen have a
[37:52] picture here of
[37:55] Israel now that Dome
[37:58] it's like a shell it act just like a
[38:01] shell they can send them Rockets
[38:03] missiles everything but there's another
[38:06] one that comes up and exploded in the
[38:09] air and there's not damage there's not
[38:11] damage for the
[38:13] people now this is a picture of T Aviv
[38:17] the capital of Israel is a capital I
[38:20] think it's a
[38:21] capital can you see how it looks like an
[38:24] awesome City all the buildings
[38:27] everything
[38:27] all good because there is a shield
[38:29] protecting that country this is Syria
[38:34] was in a war is just destroyed there was
[38:37] no
[38:38] shield
[38:41] now the end of the sermon is just to
[38:44] take the shield take the word of God
[38:46] because otherwise you can be like this
[38:49] or you can end it up like this like a
[38:52] totally destroyed City now how can we
[38:56] activate our system it's just easy it's
[38:58] just it is written this is all what we
[39:01] have this is our Shield this is how act
[39:04] I put a couple of examples here because
[39:05] this is
[39:06] um um prayer
[39:10] meeting so I won't be long even if I
[39:13] would have try to it says even if you
[39:16] have like a brotherly
[39:19] dispute amen because that can happen
[39:22] colossian if if the devil put that thing
[39:24] in your mind like ah this brother a
[39:27] doing something wrong to me I don't want
[39:28] to talk to him is not about you man I
[39:31] you you know
[39:32] that Colossians 3:13 you can hit that
[39:36] missile with this that's right for
[39:39] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[39:42] another If any man have a quel against
[39:45] any even as Christ forgave you so also
[39:48] do ye
[39:50] amen if the devil put a thought in your
[39:53] mind about a brother hit him with that
[39:56] one Hallelujah and that thought can just
[39:59] get destroyed otherwise you're going to
[40:01] start taking damage and you something
[40:03] going to start growing inside of
[40:05] youj but this one for the kids because
[40:07] now we have heaps of kids when you start
[40:10] getting
[40:11] smart if uh Ephesians six says children
[40:15] obey your parent in the Lord for this is
[40:18] right honor thy father and mother which
[40:21] is the first commandment with promise
[40:23] amen that it may be well thee and thou
[40:28] mayest live long on the earth and ye
[40:32] fathers provoke not your children to
[40:34] wrath but bring them up in the nature
[40:37] and admonition of the Lord amen so if
[40:41] you feel that you don't want to obey
[40:43] your parents if you feel that oh I'm
[40:44] smarter than this guy now I'm stronger
[40:47] than him remember that because otherwise
[40:49] you're going to get in trouble that's
[40:52] there's a no brainer just you're getting
[40:53] in trouble
[40:55] just don't let the devil put thoughts in
[40:59] your mind
[41:01] Hallelujah this wouldn't be fine if we
[41:03] wouldn't have like a shield but the Lord
[41:05] give us the best of the
[41:09] bestall even if you feel worthless what
[41:12] the Bible says about you yeah Romans 7
[41:15] says um verse 37 say nay in all these
[41:20] things we are more than conquerors
[41:22] through him that loved us for I'm
[41:25] persuaded that neither death nor life No
[41:28] Angels no principalities no powers no
[41:31] things present no things to come no
[41:34] height no deep nor any other creature
[41:37] shall be able to separate us from the
[41:39] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[41:42] lord amen how can you feel worthless
[41:44] after that knowing that the Lord love
[41:45] you so much yeah now I have a picture
[41:48] but if you don't really like bloody
[41:50] things I'm going to ask you to close
[41:52] your eyes and then I'm going to ask you
[41:54] to open it again cuz this is the picture
[41:57] of my hand when I cut my fingers for the
[41:59] second time not the first one the first
[42:01] one wasn't that okay I'm going to put it
[42:03] if you want to close your eyes it's
[42:05] going to be in three two one you want to
[42:07] see
[42:09] it that was my
[42:11] fingers on a Wednesday and I see I'm I'm
[42:14] just going to swipe for for another one
[42:16] black and white so it's not that bad I
[42:19] was working with David on Wednesday oh
[42:22] Camp was on Friday so it wasn't the same
[42:24] week and I remember that day we were
[42:26] working in Le and and I was in my mind
[42:29] came this thought of like I need to be
[42:32] very very cautious with my hands cuz I'm
[42:34] going to be playing the entire weekend
[42:36] nothing can happen to me next minute I
[42:39] got three on my
[42:40] fingers really really bad if you think
[42:43] that David's white man that day he was
[42:47] pale just like a
[42:49] [Laughter]
[42:51] ghost so they took me to the hospital
[42:54] and everything I didn't feel that much
[42:57] there was no pain I don't know why the
[42:59] Lord is just
[43:01] great they took me to the hospital and
[43:03] then they um I had to drive with um
[43:07] Stephanie to the hospital here at the
[43:10] hat and when they were doing the the
[43:12] surgery and everything something came to
[43:15] me and I was like the N she was doing my
[43:18] fingers like stitches and everything and
[43:21] I said to her do you know that I'm going
[43:22] to be playing guitar the entire
[43:24] weekend and she said to me no you are
[43:28] not that's
[43:30] impossible look look like the state of
[43:33] the fingers she asked me to go and um
[43:36] wash them my fingers man they was just
[43:39] was just wide open just like a flower or
[43:40] something like that like a flower
[43:43] yeah but there was something there was
[43:46] Faith amen I that was just the Faith
[43:50] from the Lord and I remember that
[43:53] camp I was able to play and man the Lo I
[43:57] think man that camp was just awesome was
[44:00] just awesome was incredible because I
[44:02] was playing with those uh bandages in my
[44:04] fingers but anyways I did it the Lord
[44:07] did it for me I'm very happy for that am
[44:10] but when I was a kid about like 11 12
[44:13] years or something the devil he up
[44:15] putting thoughts in my mind unbelief
[44:17] saying like the Lord doesn't
[44:19] exist and I start listening to him cuz
[44:23] in denom in the denomination they don't
[44:25] teach you these things how to fight the
[44:27] devil yeah but okay I'm going to car on
[44:30] with this story
[44:36] oh Uncle Pedro come
[44:39] here thank
[44:43] you so the devil start putting thoughts
[44:46] in my
[44:47] mind and he really tricked me and for
[44:50] many many years I didn't want to believe
[44:52] in the Lord as a young person I grew up
[44:55] look at my parents like oh you lame you
[44:58] believe in something that doesn't exist
[45:00] I was wrong but in that moment man I was
[45:04] so
[45:05] smart but anyways when I was playing in
[45:09] that camp I was hoping for a miracle I
[45:13] wanted to feel my my fingers growing
[45:16] back again every single night that we
[45:20] were playing I was like man the Lord I'm
[45:22] gonna be playing and bang my fingers are
[45:24] gonna grow and every single night the
[45:27] devil was there just
[45:28] like see it's not
[45:31] happening but he didn't know that in
[45:34] this house there was a strong man now
[45:36] living amen the spirit of the Lord was
[45:39] in me amen say just shut up Satan am
[45:43] amen I was I wanted to have like a
[45:47] miracle but it didn't happen in the way
[45:50] that I wanted to so Camp was over I went
[45:55] through n natural um
[45:57] feeling and um I was telling this to
[46:02] Noelia and she said to me
[46:05] man that was a miracle that you were
[46:08] able to play yeah and then B click on my
[46:12] head the miracle was that I was able to
[46:15] play with those
[46:17] fingers but I wanted to see another one
[46:21] but the Lord blessed me and I was able
[46:23] to play and that's something that I
[46:25] really really appreciate from the Lord
[46:27] amen cuz as a musician man if that's
[46:31] that's your everything Amen to being
[46:34] able to be there standing there or
[46:37] sitting how we play and see people
[46:39] getting healed see people receiving the
[46:42] Lord see people receiving the Holy Ghost
[46:46] Deliverance my Lord being a musician
[46:48] here it's like a it's like a coin his
[46:51] two sides cuz you would have really like
[46:54] to be on the other side worshiping but
[46:56] when you're worshipping you really
[46:57] wanted to be there playing so that's
[46:59] what happened to the
[47:00] musicians
[47:04] and and
[47:07] yeah now remember to always have this um
[47:14] system this shield on Amen because
[47:18] imagine if one day
[47:19] Israel didn't active The Shield they
[47:23] would have just take damage for no
[47:25] reason yeah cuz have the shield reason
[47:28] why they wouldn't have it why they
[47:29] wouldn't receive all the damage and
[47:32] damage can start for something really
[47:34] really
[47:35] small but then how do you think that
[47:38] this city started was an awesome City
[47:41] too with Syria and now look at it it's
[47:44] just ruins just destroyed no one can
[47:46] live it
[47:47] anymore everything just can collapse y
[47:51] so don't let the devil put thoughts in
[47:53] your mind and always trust the Lord
[47:56] let's just have the the
[47:57] musicians let's sing um Our Redeemer
