You musicians I mean well good evening everyone god bless you praise the Lord let's um let's go straight to the scripture let's go to John 3 I might actually I'm in John 3 in verses 14 and 15 John 3 verses 14 and 15 it says here and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life amen let's bow heads in a word of Prayer gracious father we want to say truly so glad we are yours Lord so glad I'm yours so thankful Your mercies followed us found us Lord overtook us Lord arrested us dear God thank you for your great mercy upon us Lord where would we be without you my lord gracious fathers we have come here my god I believe Lord the faith is risen Lord that we are under expectation to be in your Lord - that you would come and touch our lives Lord weeds I want to thank you Lord we don't serve a God of stone or wood or some God who is far away someplace or a God of history but you're the present I am you're the great eternal one Lord that everything he wants what you were in the past you are now and what you will be in the future you are right now you're the present God so I pray father may you anoint your word dear Lord father anointed to every heart I just asked Lord us want to get myself out of the way dear Lord may you come minister to you Lord your word of life to your bride Lord may you grant it for your glory and I ask father that we would walk out of these doors change people Lord different when we came in Lord may you graduate father more than Jesus Christ's name Oh is ass you take the service under your complete control for your glory that we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats I want to take a very simple thought tonight about lifting him up now we had the we had the prayer meeting a couple of weeks ago and you know you know we know that you're the Lord spoke you said you know as as Moses lifted up the brass serpent at the wilderness you know if you lift up if I am lifted up then those who've been bitten by the devil the snake bites they'll be healed I mean our young ones will be healed the other ones women but will be healed so I want to talk about lifting him up you know brother Andy was around at our place last night and he was just preaching my notes completely having fellowship I'm like oh dear I was there on Monday just at work and Lord just opened a wonderful time he just you know and you know he gave us a Monday but then brother Andy was just all over my sermons on idea anyway praise the Lord so you know when God does anything in a generation it it generates it's it's done in order to generate a response from his people you know your when when when Jesus was riding into Jerusalem on you know on the donkey we won't go and read it but you know here was God God he was here fulfilling the prophecy of the Old Testament here was the king coming and desire and here was the king you know the Lord of glory was riding meek and humble on on the back of a donkey back of an ass and here he was fulfilling Scripture and we know the people they got excited they cut down the palm your branches they laid them down you know you know we're here be growing they take off their coats they put them down as heroes yo you know for him to write over them and they cried out Hosanna blessed is he that comes in the name of the you know the name of the Lord and you know the scribes and Pharisees they're all upset yo tell them to be quiet they said to Jesus but Jesus says I tell you that if they should hold their peace stones would immediately cry out they said that there will be a response Amen from something and if they hold their peace the rocks will cry out I because here he fulfilling his word and they're very Mets and they were they were rejoicing they maybe didn't even fully understand what was going on but here they were the lord of glory was riding into Jerusalem to fulfill his word and they there was something and the people just had to cry out Hosanna blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord they couldn't contain it they couldn't hold it and Jesus said if they hold their peace the stones will cry out now I want to say I don't want to let a stone take my place I don't want to let a bird take my place or the trees or nature nothing's good I don't want nothing to take my place I want to take my place and cried Hosanna blessed be the son of David Hosanna blessed is the Lord Jesus hallelujah I wanna I want to take my place Amy because when God when God sends his word into a generation he does it not just to excite us but he's looking for a response he's looking he does it to generate a worship and a praise and the people I mean you go through Genesis when God met Abraham then Abraham would predict an altar he would he would offer a sacrifice in response to what God had just done to him hallelujah so that's when God opens his word to us what does it do it should generate a praise it should generate a worship that should generate a Thanksgiving hallelujah amen when you come to a place when you realize what God has done it's not just for your parents or your siblings or you or your spouse / it's for you kaalia they should generate a praise and a worship glory Lord you died for me you redeemed me you shed your blood for me Holly you've saved me you've given me hooda life hallelujah and should generate a praise aren't you thankful I've imagined being on death row and you know you're guilty you know you must suffer the death penalty but then someone steps in hallelujah I mean the jailed jail door comes open someone walks and maybe never seen them before but they said no the case has been dismissed color you are free to go hallelujah now do you think do you think honestly do you think honestly if you're on death row and someone comes in with proof that you're free do you think you just stay on your seat and yoyo in your cell and say that's pretty cool no parlor yeah you'll be rejoicing you'd be shouting you'd be having a jubilee all the way out of the prison hallelujah it's a good buy warden goodbye officers goodbye fellow prisoners I'm gone hallelujah hallelujah and then when you get out of the prison you'll keep dancing because you knew where you were but you know you know where you are and you know where you're going and a stop back in the prison cell you're free hallelujah yeah the Lord has done all things for us we just need to accept it rejoice in it and walk in it that's all we need to do oh it's not as generating anything it's him in us that does the work hallelujah so they rejoiced you know so basically I'm talking about how do we lift them up how do you lift them up it's not rules and say thou shalt thou shall not it's a life it's a life expressed it's a life expressed out of you that's how you lift them up you know human nature is actually people don't look up human nature people people normally look down they don't look up hallelujah I mean we're gonna lift them up high lift them up high in our lives he's done so much for us hallelujah he's done all things well he's done incredible things I'm glad I'm saved and I'm still glad I'm saved I'm still glad I'm redeemed Oh Louie it wasn't anything you did did you mirror that no way no way it's not God didn't save us that we would earn it God would save us he died for us that you just receive it and walk in and and rejoice hallelujah but it's up to you will you walk in and say yes or no I'd say yes who wants a stain a dank rank stinky jail cell hallelujah I'd rather walk free on God's green pastures and just rejoice to have a wonderful time amen so that's how we now as I said when when Jesus rode into Jerusalem there was a worship but the people didn't know who is this they see what's this going on that's God fulfilling his word and went from the Prophet to the prophecy now is the prophecy being fulfilled and here we are living in this day hallelujah Malachi fours gone off the scene now it's the son of man and his bride God is fulfilling his word and his bride hallelujah that should generate a praise hallelujah we're a happy people we're rejoicing people I mean with where Jesus is there's a lot of noise hallelujah amen there's a lot of noise where Jesus is hallelujah you know I think I think we should just you know I think I've seen it before it's light laughing all the way to the bank who's heard that expression you go on you know what you're gonna get you just happy you're laughing you get what you want you just walk out you're laughing you're happy why because it's done it's done we don't need to try and earn it it's done you know I talked about being a gardener and things on Sunday you let him be the gardener you just yield and let him do it it's not now all I've got to rearrange my life though how I rearranged my life I was a drunken University student that was me rearranging my life humanities tried to rearrange his life and look there's going to be a nuclear war and hasn't worked out very well that's why I say Lord you can rearrange me I can't rearrange myself amen hallelujah you have the smartest minds on the planet can't can't fix it how am I gonna fix me amen I'm glad he's the fixer aren't you I'm glad he's the workman hallelujah and he never cuts corners he never does a shoddy job he does all things well now as I said when when God does anything it produces a worship I mean when David saw the Ark coming into the city it produced a worship hallelujah that produced a wonderful worship I mean he was dancing he didn't care what was going on what was happening the word was being lifted up hallelujah we got to lift up the word lift up the Son of Man we're going to place a menace in his place not have him on the shelf not having trot him under feet but have him look because he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men to myself and that withdrawal actually means like a drag there's a force I mean as he's lift up there's a force that draws people drags him I mean to him hallelujah don't you want God to drag some people Holley to his presence drag him into where he is don't you want him to do that lift him up lift up his word Lord your lovely Lord your wonderful live a life of Thanksgiving and praise and worship Oh Lord you're so good Paula he is so worthy you're so worth it you're so wonderful that's how you lift it up lift them up be thankful for what he's done hallelujah amen we can create an atmosphere around us that everyone must be healed I believe brother Graham had that had that maniac come up on me come up on the platform challenged him and and then yo yo yo that man said I'll tear you limb from women but you know the Spirit of God spoke out the Prophet saying cuz you've challenged the Spirit of God you'll fall at my feet he fell at his feet and then the policeman or whatever it dragged him off he said now as I was saying faith is a substance and this person pressing here got healed spontaneously healing just started breaking out all over the audience why is that because that chief devil was defeated I mean there's an atmosphere of faith paulien people receive what they needed why cuz the Lord was lifted up and he's the same Jesus Christ now as he was back then hallelujah Amen so we can create atmosphere hallelujah you know God loves praise he loves worship he loves he loves to see his bride friggin to worship Him and dance around and say thank you Lord even if you maybe not be that demonstrative your heart can be rejoicing you say thank you Lord you saved me thank you for your mercy upon me Holly says now and then and then the scripture says that he inhabits the praises of Israel and with a spiritual Israel it's actually dwells where their praises hello if you aren't God to come dwell where you are you say well he's on my soul sure you may be still today of your Redemption you're an atmosphere around you your God to step into that atmosphere don't you believe he can I believe he can that's why he died dong that's why I died for us he could dwell in us and be with us to the end of the world holiest you didn't create an atmosphere around you and he looks down and says I'm gonna dwell in that praise haleluya Angels you're not going I'm going Kalu you I'm gonna have some worship hallelujah I'm an enjoyed in hallelujah hallelujah and he does who knows what I'm talking about tonight hallelujah amen and you know you wouldn't want to trade those moments for the world hallelujah amen so producers are a response hallelujah produces a praise now let's go to let's read a couple of scriptures go to Philippians 1 and 11 we've got to know why we're here oh yeah well know why we're here why am I here Lord look into his word and he'll tell you Philippians 1 and 11 this just let's just read Philippians 111 it says here I mean let's go yep who's this Amen being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Christ Jesus unto the prey glory and praise of God amen let's go to Ephesians 1 so we just go into the previous book here Ephesians 1 and oh you know let's just read from verse 6 I really just want to read verse 14 but I but I like reading Ephesians yeah amen to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved what's the intent to the praise of the glory of His grace and whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace when he had the bounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed himself that a dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after ye believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory hallelujah so so notice there verse 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace amen and then we read verse 14 of course unto the praise of his glory and then verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory she's saying this is why you'll hear right I mean sure it's to become one with them but what does that produce a praise that the glory of His grace hallelujah thank you Lord you took a wretched sinner such as I that was lost and undone and you wash me Amen you you shed a perfect blood and gave a perfect atonement which gave a perfect freedom from sin a perfect Loosli from the chains of the devil I mean by the blood of Jesus Christ is a perfect loosing holy that means we're not partially held by the devil you've got to accept what he's done for you and when you accept it you'll receive the power of it I mean it's not well am i worthy of it us no just accept it and walk in it hallelujah that's all you got to do it's not what can I obtain this notes actually yes Lord I I accept it you believe it you'll see it manifest in your life he will produce it in your own life hallelujah so we are made here for the praise of his glory hallelujah so there's a people upon the earth who are built to praise Him I mean they are manifested upon the earth I mean that they would praise Him and we know that that praise is not a manufactured praise I mean that's a life of God responding to his word Pali asserts her menu bringing forth appraised hello have you ever been at and then something said or a song a song and you just can't contain it just comes out hallelujah glory to God what's happening your praise is being anointed hallelujah by the Spirit of God you can't help but it just comes out why cuz we're made to praise Him hallelujah what's my job description to the prices glory hallelujah amen hey we should be we should be the most happiest people in all the world doesn't matter what we're facing God doesn't take our hardship and trials we're but even in the trial rejoice even in the hardship just rejoice because the Lord is there you know I was thinking of Israel Amen you know they followed they followed God out of Egypt into the Promised Land and in that process the enemies were drowned in the Red Sea and that process the Amalekites and all the i'ts were killed out of the land and that process Rahab was freed hallelujah and that process Amen God came and dwelt among them hallelujah and that process they took their inheritance so what does that tell me you just follow God you just walk with Him walk according to his word and you say but the enemies have to me just keep following the word and your enemy will end up drowned in the Red Sea hallelujah amen God leads them down that way I meant was gone you knew some Egyptians that are going to be drowned all of their class masters have to be drowned and the Israelites have to see it happen hallelujah so just keep following God you'll find your enemies drown behind you you'll find them dead hallelujah and just keep following God and the enemies that oppose you will end up dead as well holla just keep following the word I mean and the word will take care of your enemy hallelujah keep following the word and you'll end up in your inheritance that's all you have to do follow the word and God will take care of your enemy hallelujah Amen yeah because yeah we look at our problems we look at these things and these things are just keep following the word and he will take care he will fight your battle he will cause you to overcome hallelujah he wants to show you what's in you and how does he do that Hebrew he allows the devil to come against you he allows unforgiveness bitterness resentment trouble whatever it may be he allows the devil to come against you because he wants to show the power of his salvation in you how lujah hey we talked about this message being powerful how's it going to be manifested not just in a body change that's the culmination of our years now if walking with God right but he wants to show the power of this message and your everyday life you overcoming hallelujah isn't that right I mean many times we just look for the change in the body wall this the souls going to be transformed first got to be brought to life right and in this flesh has got to be subdued under this word hallelujah and the change in the body is just a combination of every young our entire journey hallelujah so just keep walking with God you will see your enemies drowned and you end up what does it generator worship hallelujah what caused Marian to pick up the tambourine not because they crossed the Red Sea only but because their enemies would drown behind them Hollywood 80 odd year old woman picked up a tambourine later worship hallelujah shouldn't that be the same with us I mean it's not just physical you know I'm not talking about physically enemies find talk about demon powers in high places that are warring against us amen I believe the devil can be defeated don't you what should that generate a praise I mean that's why if you say well I've just been anointed one time worship Him because he's not I'm anointed you give him thanks for what he's done hallelujah has never forget what God has done to you hey man so when we praise the Lord out of a thankful heart it causes the Lord to draw nigh to us I believe everything we have need overs in the Holy Ghost amen all of life's problems I think y'all think brother Isaac I see this as well all of life's problems our souls and just getting more of him hey man it's really that simple you just get more of him and and everything will take care of itself hallelujah Oh all we need is more of him I mean bromance is it's like a plant they drink water they push out limbs only how they grow drink push you out drink push out hallelujah you need more of God drink on the word feed on the word and you'll find a life pushing out how do you find branches pushing out hallelujah just feed on the word hallelujah hallelujah it works amen yay more you know we just need more of him and this hour we need all of him hallelujah just like Israel they didn't just cross Jordan and say here we are boys set up a city right here no no no we need more of this Promised Land we don't just want to take this but we want all of it and it's the same thing with us I mean I don't just want a little bit of God I know I'm sealed into the kingdom but now what's mine what's mine romance is like God's great big arcade is the Word of God hallelujah and faith is like a stepladder helps you step up and reach up on high shelves and get things hallelujah go searching there's more to have amen hallelujah amen you say well hey sure it says in Psalms 105 verse 37 speaking of Israel coming out of Egypt he brought them forth also was silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes so here they were a million people however many people it was they were old there were the diseased there with a crippled maybe people on their death beds but the scripture says they all walked out not a feeble one among them how did that happen Moses said kill the lamb put the blood on the door and lintel take that lamb roast it with bitter herbs eat the whole lamb so so we could just go back there may be old oh yo yo yo granddad's bent over in a chair granddad when leaving Egypt we're leaving Moses said this is the night we're gonna leave he could say well how am I gonna walk to honor that's too far I can't make it how am i I can't even move these legs he granddad eat the lamb take a bite of the slam take him by the lamb he takes a bite oh my leg feels better anymore that lam mixing he knows bread dance running around the house I'm strong again I'm strong again I'm strong again Thalia why because he's eating on that lamb Kali let's walk out let's go hallelujah and we know the lamb is the word I mean you eat on that lamb you eat on the word holy the unliving words hallelujah you'll find strength that you never knew you had hallelujah I mean if they can walk out of Egypt not one feeble one among them under eating a natural lamb under a natural blood how much were people under a supernatural blood eating a supernatural word hallelujah can walk from this world to the next world hallelujah amen granddad didn't look at his frailty he said Carol eat the lamb and he felt the strengths coming into his body it's not about what we perceive us to be just eat the lamb everything everything that we are is tied up in our atonement that's the important thing us aren't the important thing in our ability at our atonement Amen in the Old Testament winner when a worshiper was bringing in a bringing offering who did the priest look at he didn't sit he didn't set the worst renounce okay sit down put him in the interrogation chair lights over room where were you on the night of the 15th of whatever and done at her and what did you do and so he said okay you just you just go over there I've got to look at this I've got to look at what you're presenting what you're presenting matters you actually don't matter hallelujah the lamb and then once the priest examined the lamb and found it perfect and spotless according to God's Word then that lamb was offered and that man was accepted because of this not because of him but because of this how is the same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ we are accepted in the beloved not because of us we weren't examined I mean but the lamb a lamb hallelujah was examined and Pilate said I find no folded him Jesus rose out of the grave hallelujah has seen it on high offered us blood up in the Holy of Holies back down proving he was accepted his spur came down upon the church proving it was accepted hallelujah hallelujah that should produce a praise hallelujah Lord we got a he gave us a perfect lamb hallelujah we didn't have to go searching for it you provided it before we even sided looking hallelujah and the lamb found me hallelujah isn't that right we just got yous gonna keep looking at your lamb keep eating the lamb don't look at yourself look at the lamb look at the word I mean the word has been proven over and over again it works he's what matters you take your eyes off your lamb you're gonna end up in defeat hallelujah but we're not caught the end up and defeat well we're you know brother Graham says that Eve was actually predestinated to fall but the sick and even these last days has predestinated not to fall how that means there's a people upon the earth the Bride of Christ that actually their destiny is predetermined that they will not fall to Satan's lies but they will withstand him they will reject him they will take the word for their day and they'll be transformed to the image of God and they'll take a rapture hallelujah and I trust something in you saying he's talking about me hallelujah that's how it should be why is he talking about me all the time what does this message for it's about you it's not about denomination not about the Beast not about the ensure there's all that stuff but it's not really about that Eliezer didn't Eliezer wasn't sent to walk through Babylon and and and and just identify you know he wasn't sent there that was all part of it sure you know when he went to Rebecca's house he was looking for Rebecca he spoke to her denominational family he explained the gift he explained the angel of the Lord explained the supernatural and they tried to say no let her stay a bit long because they're being blessed cousin he was there the angel was there but that wasn't why Eliezer wynt Eliezer went for a woman once once the angel led her to that woman my job is done can we leave hallelujah you know this message is to identify a bride amen that's the that that's why it's here that's why the word is upon the earth is to identify the Bride of Christ hallelujah Rebecca didn't say one day I'm going to marry Abraham son and I'm gonna fall heir to all things she wasn't scheming those things she just happened to find herself with a well that she always went to hallelujah and he was taken from one well transported to another well Holly abide by eleazar's ministry hallelujah amen amen but she wasn't planning it she wasn't say well well today on her calendars this big circle hallelujah Eleazar is coming my way no she was just living everyday life but the angels found her and she found because she didn't realize she had no idea that the angel ever realized that I mean that's when the word came your way something said Here I am holy I'm not trying to duck and run but here I am Lord hallelujah and that's the same thing brother Brahim sido ah now may this word find a bride I'm coming here hunting a bride and here we are hellooo yeah restoration of the bride tree you're a brother BAM preaches about you integrated it just flies amen officious whims now he sees the bird sees I mean I mean the bird says well I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how to control how that law can control him and the way it is with us it isn't what we fight and pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this of if I don't get that it's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the Holy Spirit or anything that he's promised any claim he's given as yours and by letting go and letting God he says he'll take you there amen he'll take you

and David we know has had incredible life and incredible victories but I'm glad that the Lord could so lead him in places and in his inspired to sing about them that we could feed on his experience and say Lord he was a man after your own heart hallelujah and he would say in Psalm 61 and 1 hear my cry O God attendant to my prayer from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I so David new words like to have his heart overwhelmed amen he was he was an adopted son of God as king over Israel he was victorious in battle Amen God established his kingdom you know he was a man after God's own heart but yet he knew times when his heart would feel overwhelmed hallelujah who's had those kind of times I mean that doesn't mean we're not believers I mean that just means we're human hallelujah I mean Sir David would say when my heart is overwhelmed he says now lead me to the rock that is higher than I so he knew he needed to be led to a place I mean when his heart was feeling overwhelmed he didn't say I'll lead myself to that robbery Lord you lead me to the rock that is higher than I lead me to the revelation of

to behold god is my salvation i will trust be not afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also has become my salvation hallelujah and you're glad don't be afraid you should search how many times the bible says fear not it's with whenever an angel comes and someone says fear not don't be afraid don't be scared hallelujah he is my strength of my song he thought he also has become my salvation therefore with joy show you draw out water of the wells of salvation with joy hollien go to the word draw out water draw out a cool drink hallelujah not with all stress and stiffness and

unto the Lord for he has done excellent things has he not done excellent things hallelujah that this is known and all the earth cry out and shout thou inhabitant of Zion that's you by the way for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee he's great hallelujah amen you know John John in the book of Revelation types us brother BAM says one man in a vision represents a whole body of people you come to the end of the Ephesian leader revelations for one I saw the voice that spake with me I saw him up in heaven the doors over to see come up ever that's the translation of the saints right one man in a vision represents a whole body of people and there he is lifted up into the eternity and he sees he sees the book seals and the right and of the original owner and he wept much he was he was he was he was crying he was said he went much because he knew if someone if a man wasn't found worthy to take that book then whole of creation is in jeopardy because a man as a man forfeited the throne in Eden a man had to step forth they meant to reclaim what what man had in the beginning and no man is worthy no prophet was worthy come on Paul wasn't worthy brother Brown wasn't worthy Moses isn't worthy John nah none thermal worthy cuz rock worn and sin amen and then I remember here's John he lay on the bosom of Jesus he he he ate with him he walked with him you know there he was he but here so he wept much heavier as someone who weeps a lot whit much at something their brokenhearted thick their crestfallen but then one of the other says don't weep John don't weep to the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and when he turned to look he didn't see a lion though they are both line and he is Jesus lion and lamb he turned and saw his lamb here's the one that was offered on my behalf he steps out of the eternity and then when the book came open brother said John must have got real happy I mean because when the seals came consul Jang all in heaven and on earth and Maria hello and proud because the seal came off the Lord and God said [Applause] hallelujah and it produced a rejoicing and a shouting the book came open and the book showed John's inheritance was in heaven when the word came open he realized if I have representation over there if I have a theophany body over there then I have to step into that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and because I had that body I have to become sinless upon yeah hallelujah yes because no one's gonna miss their body in terms of not make it toward their body that's what I mean yes hallelujah you follow me that's we have if you have a theophany over there amen then you have to be really here to step into their body right and then pick up your glorified body after that hallelujah so John rejoiced that produced a worship out of his life he had seen Lazarus come out of the grave he had seen Jesus hung on Calvary he saw the tomb but when he saw that he experienced now if John is a symbol of the bride color bright I mean that means that we must experience and all the symbols that looked out they were magnification Mystery Babylon we see that big benefices you know America's coming up we see a benefits of speaking as a dragon it's all lived out if that Potts lived out what about John having a revival because the wood comes or James or someone else it wasn't even the elders saying look John is a symbol of you let's just ask the question I I just want to plow with this a little bit that powerful I mean the machineries being up for that death to ride I mean in effects been if that's happened what about job rejoicing in the would come over what about you John looking building to the time saying I see myself already I shall I see myself there already whoo yeah and when the Lord the Son of Man comes for you and it was he trying to tell you you're with me your are the antenna race and then you can't guy you top pears you got me like ever get a body in the hands already hallelujah hallelujah that's a debate and waste the tabernacle will be dissolve aces we should be such ragged burly Cristiano oh right because whatever comes against us we should just realize God's allowed it just like Jesus hit the pilot Paz I don't know how to crucify your Liga Jesus teach them and I doubt very much anyone here browse it that's the pilot who's about to be crucified don't you know that the only patty happens because it's my father's guillotine no one else hit those with the fire I got very much yeah I'm a pilot he's a man yes scourged you have no power so everything that's coming everything that comes against us we should look at you might not just keep going and then whole trial what did that whole trial do before the trial the flower comes up dies goes back again Nixon comes up in the tree that's the same thing a cheese in a cycle as he goes within that whole trial look at that trial dude open up a supernatural around the world women speak to him before that trial to happen that God would come down and speak to us [Music] I mean so you know we should just rejoice why is this happening to me God wants to open you know it's not like God has some kind of trial generator and heaven pushes a button that does this is all throwed this person to this trial know he knows what's going to happen to you and he does it because he wants the first thing where as questioners God are you angry at me happen something goes sideways and I worry about that wrong and it's because we sincere we want to serve God and we don't want to displease him in any way that's why the first question always is Lord have I done something wrong to displease you right but God doesn't do that God can't diminish his love for his bride his love is not based on our performance right it's not based on it God's love doesn't change with how we think we are behaving how we are tracking on the graph or whatever analytics we seem to have in our own life his love is based on election right sure he will correct us he'll chastise us but it's but but he has our best interest in mind right he doesn't just do it because he's frustrated I'll teach you a lesson you know that's not how it works he has our correction and mind and he's guiding us on a bit away but his love has shown an election well how do I know I'm elected who's met him who sealed into the kingdom that means you're elected hallelujah to me that's just how does I know the Lord brought me out of alcohol and party singing all the darkness of the world when I wasn't looking for him when I was running away he found me he called me and I know if he called many filled me with His Holy Spirit he's not just going to leave me I believe I believe this holding power and the Holy Ghost I believe there's a real holding power and the Holy Ghost you say Lord I'm slipping sideways say Lord I just need more of you hallelujah I believe it don't you amen hallelujah amen David David was being taken up oh I'll just finish with this just like Israel God will allow you to go through dark places that has enemy is defeated God told Moses where to go to go to the Red Sea they weren't just running for their lives from Egypt they said ah here let's go had to be destroyed to see them because rayul had to know the enemy was defeated it's the same thing with you and I God lives amid that the enemy would be defeated now his David he's just and and just kingship him David his boy to the throne he goes from here to here he didn't know exactly he knew the ending submission cuz he believed what God said he could become and he didn't know what would happen between a and B but every enemy that David came against he defeated and God wants to show them I loo you God want to show wherever you go wherever I lead you the truck we see don't touch the Lord's anointed God will take care of us time we are a meaning we have 40 years of Philistines all different kinds of ones God defeated all the same thing with us friends hallelujah but shouldn't we lift them up and then doesn't you do all things well don't we serve at your Living God isn't he glorious and wonderful as the easly the best thing that ever happened to Holly when you first met him Lord a new glorious and I trusted he's more glorious today than he was the first day that he called you hallelujah the friends you wanna see victory just lift them up No someone did a study and I just thought this was neat someone did a study about the best way to eradicate gorse - to get rid of course has not cut it all down just plant trees among it and when the tree grows above the course the shade tree generated by the trees the trees actually killed the boss translate the word of God no this is just me I thought it was neat when I read it will wither up and die hallelujah amen but he's worthy isn't he good he's done all things well he's kept us on the path hallelujah many times even ourselves say we'll quit God said you're not going to quit hello I'm determined that you won't quit something and you said yes look let's just read Psalms 27 and then and then we need musicians we really do amen let's go Sam's 27 brother Brown preaches the rapture message from Psalm 27 speaking of the condition of the believer that it's ready for a rapture amen Laurie I mean Sam 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear he's my light he guides my path I can see where - gonna start workers he's my light and he's my salvation he's my deliverance hallelujah he's my atonement amen whom shall I fear if he's my light and my salvation what do I have to fear amen the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid I mean the strength of my life is not me and my ability he is the strength of my life when the wicked even my enemies and my folks come up upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell there was a day when when the enemy and my folks came upon me to eat up my flesh I stumbled and fell there was a day but then he came and then and then the tables are turned and that same enemy came against me it stumbled and fell because of him hallelujah so our host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear that's why we we don't need to fear this world I mean we don't need to fear the devil sure there's been a hundred million or whatever devils loosed on the sage that weren't before sure the devil's rampant but we don't need to fear him I mean I've God is greater than all the hosts of hell amen our God wouldn't allow us to be in this evil age if he didn't believe he could keep us in this world I mean Jesus said Jesus said I don't take them from the world but I just pray you be you'd keep them in this world amen and that prayer still rings true today hallelujah so we don't need to worry how bad the world get so we'll get bad and the scripture says it will wax worse and worse I mean but we don't need to be terrified of it because God's salvation is always greater than what the devil can produce amen so the host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should arise against me and this will I be confident who's who said war come against you if you're a believer you'll be facing some battles hallelujah why do you say praise your God to that because God is greater than the battle God is greater than the enemy I mean one thing so and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple from the time of trouble this is a time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock proverb says the third pull is not a public show I think that is gardener's bride becoming one a man that's a secret because the devil don't manufactured he doesn't a man he can't produce it I mean so this on the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pro villian and the secret of his tabernacle Shelli hide me he shall set me up upon a rock hallelu who's who's built upon the rock of Revelation amen hallelujah and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I shall sing I'll sing praises unto the Lord here our Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me now look at this when thou sittest seeking my face my heart said unto thee the I face Lord will I seek so when God spoke my heart responded said lord I will oh that's a deep calling to the deep hallelujah hide not my face far from me put not my seven away and anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me O God of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach thee or teach me thy way O Lord and lead me in the plain path because of my enemies to love me not over until my enemies for false witnesses have risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord make that your daily bread because that is the condition of the believer that's ready for the rapture hallelujah and God makes us ready amen do you say Lord this is what your word says I am Here I am make
