[24:57] evening everyone
[24:58] I mean if you've got your arm you've got
[25:03] your Bibles handy let's turn to John 17
[25:15] quite a lengthy scripture reading but
[25:19] we're just going to read most of most of
[25:22] John 17 from from verse 1 this is these
[25:26] words these words spake Jesus and lifted
[25:30] up his eyes to heaven and said father
[25:32] the hour has come glorify thy son that
[25:35] thy son also may glorify thee as thou
[25:38] has given him power over all flesh that
[25:40] he should give eternal life to as many
[25:42] as thou hast given him and this is he
[25:45] this is life eternal that they might
[25:47] know thee the only true God and Jesus
[25:50] Christ whom thou has sent I have
[25:53] glorified thee on the earth I have
[25:55] finished the work which thou gave us me
[25:58] to do and now O Father glorify thou me
[26:01] with thine own self with the glory which
[26:04] I had with thee before the world was I
[26:07] will I have manifested thy name unto the
[26:10] men which thou gave us me out of the
[26:13] world
[26:13] thine they were and thou and thou gave
[26:16] us them me and they have kept thy word
[26:19] now they have known that all things
[26:23] whatsoever thou has given me are of thee
[26:26] for I have given unto them the words
[26:29] which thou gave us me and they have
[26:31] received them and have known surely that
[26:35] I came out from thee and they have
[26:37] believed that thou descend me I pray for
[26:40] them I pray not for the world but for
[26:42] them which thou has given me for they
[26:45] are thine and all mine a vine and thine
[26:48] and mine and I'm glorified in them and
[26:50] now I am no more in the world but these
[26:53] are in the world and I come to the Holy
[26:55] Father keep through thine own name those
[26:58] whom thou has given me that they may be
[27:01] one as we are while I was with them in
[27:05] the world I kept them in thy name those
[27:08] that they gave us me I have kept and
[27:10] none of them is lost but the son of
[27:12] perdition that the scripture might be
[27:13] fulfilled and now come I to thee and
[27:16] these things I speak in the world that
[27:19] they might have my joy fulfilled in
[27:23] themselves
[27:24] I have kept I have given them my word in
[27:28] the
[27:28] Heita them because they are not of the
[27:31] world even as I am NOT of the world I
[27:33] pray not that thou should us take them
[27:36] out of the world but there should us
[27:38] keep them from the evil they are not of
[27:41] the world even as I am NOT of the world
[27:43] sanctify them through thy truth thy Word
[27:47] is truth
[27:49] amen may the Lord bless us would you may
[27:52] have your seats tonight
[27:54] I mean I just want to you know we're
[27:58] approaching the Lord's table tonight and
[28:01] you know we know it's more than that's
[28:03] not a tradition that's not something we
[28:04] do every so often to fulfill the duty
[28:08] but there's something very special when
[28:11] a believer makes a public declaration of
[28:14] who they are you know when we when we
[28:18] approach the table we'll go into it a
[28:20] bit later on but you know you are by
[28:22] taking the bread and taking the taking
[28:24] the wine which are symbolic of the
[28:27] Lord's body and blood you are declaring
[28:29] to everyone here you've become one with
[28:32] him and if you've become one with him
[28:34] your life is very different to what it
[28:36] once was
[28:36] it is not the your old life you are
[28:40] living a new life right it's his life
[28:43] and you manifesting right and so now it
[28:48] says here in in John 17 13 and now come
[28:52] I to thee and these things I speak in
[28:55] the world
[28:56] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[29:00] themselves
[29:00] now the joy that was sitting for the
[29:03] Lord the joy that was set before him was
[29:07] you redeemed right he endured the cross
[29:10] despising the shame and sit down the
[29:13] right hand of the Majesty on high
[29:15] because of the joy that was set before
[29:17] him right which was you redeemed so now
[29:20] he's saying that they might have my joy
[29:22] fulfilled in themselves so his joy was
[29:27] you around the throne his joy was you
[29:30] redeemed his joy was you made in his
[29:33] image his joy was himself in a people
[29:36] right his joy was his bride I mean
[29:40] becoming one with him
[29:41] that was his joy his joy was taking
[29:44] people and manifesting his life through
[29:47] that people upon the earth his joy was
[29:50] having a people that out of their own
[29:52] free will they would gladly give
[29:54] themselves to him I mean that they would
[29:57] become loved prisoners of Jesus Christ
[29:59] they wouldn't do it out of Judea because
[30:01] of a teaching but because of a
[30:03] relationship that they had entered into
[30:05] I mean that they would do this this walk
[30:09] we have with God is all the relationship
[30:12] right and how we treat others and how we
[30:15] treat the Lord is really based on what
[30:17] we see our relationship being right if
[30:20] we see him as rules and as as a as they
[30:23] mean God that beats us down that's how
[30:25] we will respond back to him will respond
[30:27] out of fear and and you know we won't
[30:30] walk in confidence out of how what he's
[30:33] made us to be right but if he has
[30:35] revealed himself his love has become
[30:37] manifest in our lives I mean that the
[30:40] word he he becomes a living reality in
[30:43] us then we'll respond ever father my
[30:46] father my father where once under the
[30:48] slavery of sin and bondage a me but then
[30:51] but then he came I mean he he filled us
[30:55] with His Holy Spirit work right where we
[30:57] have received the spirit of adoption the
[31:00] placing of a child in the body right so
[31:03] where we cry Abba Father my father my
[31:05] father so when when that Amen comes upon
[31:08] the seat of God they look at God and
[31:11] look at themselves very differently
[31:12] because once we were aliens Amen from
[31:16] the Commonwealth of God we we were his
[31:18] enemy the scripture tells us but then
[31:20] something happened he happened the
[31:23] Spirit of Truth happened Amen all right
[31:26] and then you begin to see life very
[31:28] differently hallelujah it was not
[31:30] someone else's testimony it became your
[31:32] testimony it wasn't someone else's story
[31:35] or the Bible was just a historical book
[31:37] written to someone else it became a
[31:39] personal love letter to you hallelujah
[31:43] so now this is what God wanted us to
[31:46] have that his joy that my joy they might
[31:52] have my joy fulfilled in themselves
[31:56] hallelujah amen now he says here he has
[32:03] given us his word and we have kept his
[32:06] word a mint we have kept his word by the
[32:09] spirit of truth that's in us that's how
[32:12] the word has kept it's not by our
[32:14] nobility our mental gymnastics it's
[32:16] God's Spirit in us caused us to keep his
[32:19] word now we have received spiritual
[32:25] strength in this day right we have
[32:28] received strength to overcome the world
[32:30] the devil everything in it we have
[32:33] received overcoming power amen we are
[32:36] not a beaten-down group of people I mean
[32:39] the brightest victorious the bride is an
[32:41] overcoming group that means we have to
[32:44] fight there'll be a battle there'll be
[32:45] hard times they'll be clothes scrapes
[32:47] but we'll overcome
[32:49] I mean we're anointed to overcome I mean
[32:52] just as these scribes and Pharisees were
[32:54] anointed to doubt and reject so the
[32:56] disciples were anointed to receive him
[32:58] Amen and they overcame in their age
[33:00] every overcome every believer through
[33:03] the scripture they had something to
[33:04] overcome and they overcame right Caleb
[33:07] and Joshua overcame they overcame the
[33:09] doubts and evil reports of the other
[33:11] spies they believed that God had given
[33:13] them the land and that's what caused
[33:14] them to overcome the faith and the
[33:16] promised word of their day caused them
[33:18] to overcome right Caleb when he heard
[33:21] Moses preaching he knew was more than
[33:23] Moses speaking and was God giving him a
[33:25] promise and a soul was anchored on that
[33:27] promise amen and it became a living
[33:30] reality in his life because he possessed
[33:32] he and his inheritance he overcame the
[33:34] doubts he overcame the murmuring he
[33:37] overcame everything that was bad in the
[33:38] camp he just saw a promise and he was
[33:40] walking towards that promise
[33:42] Amen I believe it should be the same
[33:44] thing with us I mean that everything
[33:46] else just should just fade away we
[33:47] should just see the promise of God I
[33:49] knew when Abraham's life was written up
[33:51] in Romans 4 it said he staggered not at
[33:53] the promise of God was strong giving
[33:55] price I mean he was fully persuaded that
[33:58] God was able to perform that which he
[34:00] had promised Polyana has
[34:02] come the same with you and I but we
[34:04] don't worry about the situation we don't
[34:06] worry about the obstacles and what the
[34:08] enemy may be doing but God has sent as
[34:10] sure word of prophecy goddess into the
[34:12] show word from Russia I mean we know
[34:15] where we're going we know who we are
[34:17] hallelujah do you know who you are in
[34:19] him for you and darkness hallelujah I
[34:22] don't believe we're in darkness I know
[34:24] I'm a son of Jesus Christ I mean I know
[34:27] because he called me he chose me before
[34:29] the foundation of the world he made
[34:31] himself known to me I'm now a new
[34:33] creature in him hallelujah so I know
[34:36] where I came from and I know where I'm
[34:38] going
[34:39] hallelujah now it's just a walk of faith
[34:41] through the in-between time
[34:43] hallelujah say well there's a lot of
[34:45] them between time not according to
[34:46] Eternity it's just a vapor this life is
[34:50] a vapor and it's gone you ever seen some
[34:52] vapor go
[34:53] oh we're Decker I don't know hallelujah
[34:56] life is but a vapor
[34:57] we have eternity to enjoy and we have
[35:01] all God upon the earth with us now amen
[35:05] so we have to know and I believe we do
[35:09] know who we are
[35:10] Jesus had faith and who he was he said
[35:14] for this cause I've come into the world
[35:16] as as God's provided sacrifice he knew
[35:19] he was the Messiah he wasn't doubting he
[35:22] wasn't questioning he knew who he was
[35:25] right and it should be the same thing
[35:27] with us by our new birth a real birth I
[35:30] mean you know when when a baby's born
[35:32] life was produced I mean something
[35:36] happens I mean everyone involved knows
[35:39] about it they were there doesn't matter
[35:41] if it's the easiest birth of the hardest
[35:43] birth it's burst life comes a new life
[35:46] now enters the house that was once just
[35:49] maybe talked about maybe felt the legs
[35:51] kick in all these things and you know
[35:53] what's he or she gonna look like maybe
[35:55] you can get a scan to see well this is
[35:56] you know this is this is what they might
[36:00] look like but it's very different when
[36:02] you're actually holding that life when
[36:04] the life becomes a reality it becomes a
[36:07] very different and now this life starts
[36:09] living and now you're because you've got
[36:11] to protect this life you got to see it
[36:13] grow you've actually got a your life is
[36:15] actually dick
[36:16] hated to buy this little few kilos of
[36:19] life but even even a woman that's
[36:22] pregnant she walks different ways she
[36:24] eats different things I mean cuz he's a
[36:26] life in her dictating Torah watch you
[36:29] should eat what she should not eat why
[36:30] she should do what she should not do
[36:32] because she's waiting to protect this
[36:33] life that's growing and it should be the
[36:36] same thing with us life comes in
[36:38] so saying this morning the things you
[36:40] once did you don't do amen and the
[36:43] things you do I mean you never used to
[36:46] do what's happened a life is coming
[36:49] hallelujah and now you're a different
[36:52] person now
[36:56] we have been given as I said before
[37:00] we've been given spiritual power to
[37:03] overcome I mean through his word through
[37:07] his word that's been revealed it gives
[37:10] us spiritual strength to overcome this
[37:12] world to overcome the enemy right when
[37:15] he comes into our life it's the enemy
[37:18] that gets defeated it's no longer us I'm
[37:22] gonna read a couple of Scripture I want
[37:25] this to mean a lot
[37:26] say Lord me but he chose you as the
[37:30] scripture says I think someone said it
[37:31] in their blessing for for Hannah you
[37:34] know Jesus says that you didn't choose
[37:38] me I chose you
[37:40] and as the same through every generation
[37:42] we did not choose God we thought we were
[37:45] chasing after him actually no he was
[37:47] chasing after us when Adam and Eve fell
[37:49] in the garden they had themselves when
[37:51] God came down God was hunting for his
[37:53] children to redeem them back to where
[37:55] they should be and it's been all the way
[37:57] down through the scripture God has been
[37:59] hunting his children hallelujah I'm glad
[38:02] he chased me down I'm glad he found me
[38:07] and he chases us down because those want
[38:10] to leave us in the state maroon he wants
[38:12] to lift us up he wants to lift us up
[38:15] that we are joint heirs with him
[38:17] hallelujah so now we're gonna go to
[38:21] Ephesians chapter 2 which I did quote
[38:26] this morning
[38:30] [Music]
[38:33] read from verse 1 a new healthy
[38:38] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[38:40] and sins we're and in times past ye
[38:44] walked according to the course of this
[38:45] world according to the Prince of the
[38:48] power of the air the spirit that now
[38:50] worketh in the children of disobedience
[38:52] this is we were all this way among whom
[38:56] also we all had our conversation in
[38:59] times past in the lusts of our flesh
[39:01] fulfilling the desires of our flesh and
[39:04] of the mind and we're by nature the
[39:06] children of Wrath even as others but God
[39:09] basically at one time we did what we
[39:11] wanted its own lust of the flesh lust of
[39:14] the mind we just did what we wanted you
[39:16] know the biggest problem was when
[39:18] someone says I will sins started with
[39:22] two words in heaven in the heart of
[39:24] Lucifer I will I will ascend I will I
[39:28] will rise above what I should be well
[39:31] God has made me to be
[39:32] that's where sin started two words in
[39:33] the mind of a angel and it's now it's
[39:37] upon the earth and that's the biggest
[39:39] problem is when we say I will no it
[39:42] shouldn't but the answer to that is not
[39:44] my will but thy will be done
[39:45] Jesus showed us how to overcome not my
[39:48] will not the desires of my flesh or my
[39:50] mind but his will but God who's Richard
[39:55] mercy and he's very Richard mercy for in
[39:58] his great lover and he loved us even
[40:00] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[40:02] us together with Christ by grace ye are
[40:06] safe divine influence upon the heart and
[40:09] the reflection and the life amen we were
[40:12] dead now we've been quickened who's been
[40:14] quickened I know it's hot in here I know
[40:15] I've had a long day beliefs rejoice I
[40:18] mean listen let's be thankful you know
[40:21] pit yo-yo I've heard someone say well
[40:23] God's not deaf you don't need to shout
[40:26] but you can't defin him at the same time
[40:29] okay and he's raised us up together and
[40:34] made us sit together in heavenly places
[40:36] in Christ Jesus as the believers
[40:38] position in Christ joint is with him a
[40:41] minute just like the devil remember the
[40:43] devil was an angel now he's a fallen
[40:45] angel angels are servants they are not
[40:47] sons and daughters of God you take a
[40:49] royal family who has more authority with
[40:51] the king and queen a servant or the
[40:54] children of the Prince or the princess
[40:56] they have more I mean because they're in
[40:59] the family this is the bloodline
[41:01] continuing it's more important than a
[41:03] servant it's the same thing now with us
[41:05] we have God's children by His grace we
[41:08] have more authority I mean then then
[41:10] then even the Archangels with God
[41:12] because we're family we're not servants
[41:13] right he loves his family more than his
[41:16] servants and the devil was once a
[41:19] servant now he's a fallen servant he got
[41:21] fired
[41:22] right so now he's just a problem to the
[41:24] company yeah
[41:25] so why would he have to worry about he's
[41:29] raised us up together and made us sit
[41:31] together in heavenly places in Christ
[41:33] Jesus
[41:34] then in the ages to come he might show
[41:36] the exceeding riches of His grace in his
[41:39] kindness towards us through Christ Jesus
[41:43] amen for by grace are ye saved through
[41:46] faith and that is not of yourselves as a
[41:48] gift of God not of works lest any man
[41:51] should boast for we are his workmanship
[41:53] who's being worked on
[41:56] hallelujah the working starts he will
[41:58] perfect keep working on me Lord it's
[42:02] like a sculpture you know that marble
[42:04] could feel something you would know
[42:05] you know when the sculptor takes a you
[42:07] know the chisel and the hammer and
[42:08] whatever more that marble would say I
[42:10] don't want to be hit by it it doesn't
[42:11] feel too good
[42:12] wait till you're done and then I'll show
[42:14] you a mirror you'll enjoy you'll enjoy
[42:16] what you really look like it's the same
[42:18] thing with us that your God takes us
[42:20] wirdy
[42:20] checks us and deals if you know you got
[42:23] a temper you're unforgiving you got this
[42:25] and this and all you shouldn't have said
[42:26] that you did this wrong and and what
[42:28] happens he's going to take his chisel
[42:29] his hammer hallelujah he wants to work
[42:31] on you amen but he's got a mirror he
[42:34] wants you he it was to reflect listen
[42:37] you
[42:37] I'm glad we're his workmanship created
[42:41] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[42:44] God hath before ordained that we should
[42:46] walk in them oh I'm glad our walk has
[42:50] been ordained wherefore remember that
[42:53] you were being in times past Gentiles in
[42:56] the flesh who are called uncircumcision
[42:57] by that which is called the circumcision
[43:00] in the flesh made by hands that at that
[43:03] time you were without Christ being
[43:06] aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel
[43:07] and strangers from the covenants of
[43:10] promise without hope and without God in
[43:13] the world but now in Christ Jesus you
[43:16] who are sometimes were far off are made
[43:18] nigh by the blood of Christ the blood
[43:21] puts us back on speaking terms with God
[43:23] hallelujah for he is our peace we're
[43:27] just going to read two more I like the
[43:28] book of Ephesians it's hard just to read
[43:30] it but you know it's all good you know
[43:32] for he is our peace who has broken I
[43:34] mean sue who hath made both one and has
[43:37] broken down the middle wall of partition
[43:39] between us so he is our pcs made both
[43:42] one he's made us one with himself
[43:44] amen having abolished in his flesh the
[43:48] enmity even the law of commandments
[43:49] contained in ordinances for to make in
[43:52] himself of twain one you man so making
[43:57] peace let's just keep reading down to
[43:59] verse 18 and that he might reconcile
[44:01] both undergone in one body by the cross
[44:04] having slain the enmity thereby and came
[44:07] and preached peace to you which were
[44:08] afar off and to them which were nigh for
[44:11] through him we both have access by one
[44:14] spirit unto the father hallelujah I mean
[44:19] I'm glad I'm glad that is true now the
[44:23] Lord chose us I believe in election I
[44:27] thank God for election because if there
[44:30] was an election then a be our merit I
[44:32] have nothing to give you know people say
[44:34] well god I've done this I've done this
[44:36] I've done this but then you have to give
[44:37] you bad you can't just give the good
[44:39] party see I forgot to give all the bad
[44:41] and all the good and try and give it to
[44:43] me and he says I don't want it because
[44:46] because our righteousness but filthy
[44:47] rags I'm glad it's not I'm glad it's
[44:50] election
[44:51] he chose me hallelujah and if he chose
[44:54] me there's a reason he chose me amen and
[44:57] I'm glad there's no merit of myself I
[44:59] mean I'm glad there's no merit of myself
[45:02] because otherwise it's certain IQ
[45:04] certain whatever whatever you know this
[45:06] criteria there's only one criteria you
[45:08] have been chosen before the foundation
[45:10] of the world can't we rejoice in that
[45:15] fact how we rejoice I believe we can
[45:18] amen
[45:20] now we read an exodus
[45:24] it's got Exodus 12 we won't be too much
[45:28] longer but now as I said before God's
[45:31] given us power to overcome I mean
[45:35] through him we will overcome this world
[45:38] we are more than Paul said we're more
[45:41] than conquerors through him that loved
[45:42] us Paul knew what it's like to have a
[45:44] bad day right he ended up in jail he got
[45:47] beaten he got shipwrecked he got stoned
[45:48] he all kinds of things happened to him
[45:50] be seized I'm more than a conqueror
[45:52] hallelujah he knew what he was talking
[45:54] about I mean he was under your pirogue
[45:56] by faith rather than all different kinds
[45:58] of things we said I'm more than a
[46:00] conqueror hallelujah
[46:02] and then also in his darkest moment
[46:04] there in thee was that the man Mateen
[46:06] prison river he was before he got
[46:07] beheaded he says he's a crown of life
[46:09] waiting for me that's someone that's
[46:13] overcoming that someone is not looking
[46:15] at circumstance that's someone who's
[46:17] loving true to the promise true to us
[46:19] Commission amen Exodus 12 and now it
[46:27] says let's read from from verse four and
[46:31] if the household be too little for the
[46:34] lamb let him and his neighbor next unto
[46:36] his house take it according to the
[46:37] number of souls
[46:39] every man according to his eating shall
[46:42] ye count for your lamb your lamb shall
[46:44] be without blemish a male of the first
[46:46] year you shall take it from the Sheep or
[46:49] from the goats and you shall keep it up
[46:51] until the fourteenth day of the self I
[46:53] mean of the same month and the whole
[46:55] Assembly of the congregation of Israel
[46:56] shall kill it in the evening and they
[46:58] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[47:01] the two side posts and the upper
[47:03] doorpost of the house
[47:04] ruin they shall eat it and they shall
[47:06] eat the flesh in that night roast with
[47:09] fire and unleavened bread and with
[47:12] bitter herbs they shall eat it eat it
[47:15] not raw nor sodden at all with water but
[47:18] roast with fire his head with his legs
[47:20] and with the Ferdinand parts thereof and
[47:22] you shall let nothing of it remain until
[47:24] the morning and that which remaineth of
[47:26] it until the morning you shall burn with
[47:28] fire and thus show you eat it with your
[47:30] loins girded your shoes on your feet and
[47:32] your staff in your hand and you shall
[47:34] eat it in haste this is the Lord's
[47:37] Passover now this was the the children
[47:42] of Israel he took the communion and type
[47:44] they left Egypt by the power of the Lamb
[47:48] right the blood was applied they were
[47:51] safe from the Death Angel but they
[47:53] became one with that lamb they
[47:54] sacrificed they became one with it as
[47:57] I've said I know I say it every time but
[48:00] you know if you took a typical house
[48:02] there you see a lamb and you see a
[48:04] people then you see a house and then the
[48:06] lamb gets killed and they see someone
[48:08] apply blood and then and then they eat
[48:11] the lamb then they walked out so they
[48:13] became one with their sacrifice they
[48:15] became one with the atoning blood that
[48:18] that was there that the death and you
[48:20] couldn't strike them the very life I
[48:22] mean the very animal that they
[48:23] sacrificed that kept them safe from the
[48:25] Death Angel they became one worth and
[48:27] they walked out of Egypt under the
[48:29] strength of that lamb by the strength of
[48:32] that physical food right that physical
[48:34] sacrifice they took that and they walked
[48:37] out of Egypt just like if you don't eat
[48:40] you're not going to be strong you're
[48:42] gonna wear out you to get tired right
[48:44] better and then if you eat junk food is
[48:46] not going to help you all that much you
[48:47] may put on some weight but you know it's
[48:49] not going to give you the vitamins and
[48:51] strength you really need but if you eat
[48:52] a healthy diet amen then you'll be all
[48:55] right
[48:56] hallelujah and the healthiest diet I
[48:58] know is the Word of God I'm in the full
[49:01] that's why I said you got to take the
[49:02] whole lamb roaster with bitter herbs
[49:04] even the pertinent parts there off and
[49:06] you got to eat it she would eat the
[49:08] wonderful parts of the wreck and the
[49:10] whatever all the nice parts of the lamb
[49:13] and the bad parts what you think is the
[49:15] bad parts but God obviously thought
[49:17] you-you-you need the whole word Jesus is
[49:21] our Passover right here's our sacrifice
[49:23] and so they they left Egypt under the
[49:28] strength of their atonement amen and now
[49:31] we are not eating a physical lamb but we
[49:36] have to become one with our sacrifice
[49:38] and this is very vital in this age where
[49:41] it goes from just the life that was
[49:43] there on Calvary Jesus died his blood
[49:47] was shed and in the life is in the blood
[49:50] the scripture tells us and his life was
[49:52] released that down Calvary and the
[49:55] invoker in the Upper Room received that
[49:57] life so they became one with their
[50:00] sacrifice because the life that was in
[50:02] the sacrifice came into them and then
[50:05] they're very works and the life that was
[50:07] in display and the Messiah was now
[50:10] displayed in them and that was the proof
[50:13] they became one with this sacrifice
[50:14] right there was more than just a
[50:16] confession it was a reality the life
[50:19] they lived proved they became one with
[50:22] him right because even the scribes and
[50:24] Pharisees noted that these men had been
[50:27] with Jesus because the same miracles the
[50:29] same life that was lived in the Messiah
[50:32] was now in his church was Balan his
[50:34] brightness and that was the proof they
[50:37] had become one with him that was the
[50:40] periphery use today's language that they
[50:42] had received Jesus into their hearts
[50:45] what give your heart to Jesus well
[50:47] that's going to have a manifestation
[50:49] that's good you got to give your heart
[50:51] to him but he's going to come receive
[50:52] your faith and come and live in you yes
[50:53] hello I'm glad he does amen so now we
[50:59] they became one with the lamb in the
[51:02] Exodus and that Exodus amen and as the
[51:05] as the yo the church had a spiritual
[51:09] exodus from the traditions of man into
[51:11] the Living God right they became one
[51:14] with their sacrifice in order to make
[51:16] that Exodus now in this third Exodus
[51:18] where people are leaving this world I
[51:20] mean and going into heaven you have to
[51:23] become one with him as well right you
[51:25] can't go by association or by argument
[51:28] or by creed you must become
[51:29] with the living Lord Jesus Christ I mean
[51:32] that his life has to come unto you
[51:35] amen that's how you know the blood has
[51:37] really been applied to your life is
[51:39] because his life comes unto you and live
[51:42] oh I'm glad that that is the case I mean
[51:50] and and brother Bram says the token is
[51:53] he that is the token that is showing
[51:56] that your price has been paid you're on
[51:58] your way
[51:59] amen that you're on your way it's like
[52:01] you know you can't go jump on an
[52:03] airplane with just the money you can go
[52:06] to the boarding counter you know or you
[52:08] can try and go and check in they say do
[52:11] you have your tickets well here's the
[52:12] mattings i say no you can't get on this
[52:14] plane you need the ticket but I have the
[52:17] money no you need to ticket right and
[52:19] it's the same thing if the life of God
[52:21] is in you that is your ticket to eating
[52:24] get on the plane or get on the gospel
[52:26] ship or the gospel train what do you
[52:28] want to talk you know whatever analogy
[52:29] you want that's going to go to heaven
[52:30] that is your the proof that you're on
[52:33] your way that your destination is
[52:36] settled because you're sealed into the
[52:37] kingdom
[52:38] that's how glorious it is isn't it
[52:39] wonderful maybe I should make us so
[52:42] relaxed in him jesus paid it all I
[52:45] received it all my way I'm on my way to
[52:50] heaven
[52:50] shouting I mean because he won the
[52:54] victory for me hallelujah glory to God
[52:58] now I'm glad so we have and so that's
[53:03] why this is just symbolic we know it
[53:07] doesn't literally turn into his blood
[53:09] and and his flesh but it's symbolic
[53:13] Jesus sees in John 6 that's just - and
[53:16] they quickly
[53:29] and we'll read we'll read from verse 52
[53:37] or even verse 48 at John 6 I am that
[53:40] Bread of Life
[53:40] your father's deep met did eat manna in
[53:43] the wilderness and I did this is the
[53:45] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[53:47] a man may eat thereof and not die I am
[53:50] The Living bread which came down from
[53:52] heaven
[53:52] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[53:55] live forever and the bread that I will
[53:58] give is my flesh which I will give for
[54:01] the life of the world the Jews therefore
[54:03] strove among themselves saying how can
[54:06] this man give us his flesh to eat then
[54:09] jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[54:11] unto you except ye eat the flesh of the
[54:13] Son of Man and drink his blood you have
[54:16] no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh
[54:18] and drinketh my blood hath eternal life
[54:20] and I'll raise him up at the last day
[54:22] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[54:25] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[54:27] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[54:30] I in him as the living father has sent
[54:32] me and I live by the father so he that
[54:35] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[54:38] is the bread that came down from heaven
[54:40] not as your father's did eat manna and I
[54:42] did he that eateth of this bread shall
[54:45] live for ever he's saying you have to
[54:48] become one with your sacrifice you have
[54:51] to become one where it's not you and
[54:53] your sacrifice but you become one right
[54:55] and we know that what he's meaning is
[54:58] you have to become one with him his life
[55:00] has to come in you and that that is how
[55:03] you live forever hallelujah you say well
[55:07] what what does this have to do with the
[55:09] communion let's go to 1st Corinthians 11
[55:23] let's read from verse 2023 he says for I
[55:32] have received of the Lord that also
[55:34] which I delivered unto you that the Lord
[55:37] Jesus the same night in which he was
[55:38] betrayed took bread and when he had
[55:40] given thanks he brake it and said take
[55:43] eat this is this is my body which is
[55:46] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[55:49] me
[55:49] after the same manner also he took the
[55:51] cup which he had supped saying this cup
[55:54] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[55:57] ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance
[55:59] of me
[56:00] so he's saying that these are these are
[56:03] symbolic of my body
[56:05] and my blood and what happens now is
[56:08] when you when you take of the bread and
[56:12] the wine the body of the Lord in in
[56:15] symbolic form you are giving a
[56:18] declaration that you have become one
[56:20] with him and his life is living out of
[56:23] you this is what you're telling everyone
[56:25] here you're saying I have become a
[56:27] Christian because he's in me right and
[56:30] the life I now live I live by the faith
[56:32] of the Son of God I mean this is this is
[56:35] why it's a rejoicing time because he
[56:37] paid it all he washed us he's redeemed
[56:40] us we're on our way to heaven shouting
[56:42] victory right it's wonderful but then
[56:45] also he gave you everything for us he
[56:49] chose you he chose me who was I there
[56:53] were billions upon the earth when he
[56:54] found me and the people who mean to that
[56:56] I mean you know you'd think in your own
[56:58] mind why did he pick this rich when he
[57:01] picked someone else who's smarter or
[57:02] whatever or can put his ways to get the
[57:05] better I don't know someone who seems
[57:06] more qualified but he chose me and he
[57:08] had a purpose for choosing me and he had
[57:11] a purpose for calling and choosing you
[57:13] hallelujah Amen see so we're giving a
[57:17] public declaration I've become one with
[57:19] my lamb hallelujah and I'm walking
[57:23] through life's journey by the strength
[57:24] of the lamb I mean I am a Christian by
[57:27] the strength of the lamb not by anything
[57:30] else but by the strength of lamb the
[57:32] lamb is the word he's a living word amen
[57:35] so we are walking through this
[57:37] world by the strength of the Living Word
[57:39] made manifest in us hallelujah for us
[57:46] off this go to verse 26 for us off as ye
[57:48] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[57:51] show the Lord's death till he come
[57:53] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[57:55] and drink this cup unworthily shall be
[57:59] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[58:01] but let a man examine himself and so let
[58:05] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[58:07] Cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[58:09] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[58:11] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[58:14] body for this cause many are weak and
[58:16] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[58:19] we would judge ourselves we should not
[58:22] be judged but when we are judged we are
[58:24] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[58:27] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[58:29] brethren when you come together to eat
[58:31] tarry one for another and if any man
[58:34] hunger let him eat at home then you come
[58:36] not together under condemnation and the
[58:39] rest will I sit in order when I come so
[58:43] you're making we're making a public
[58:45] declaration I've become one with my
[58:48] Messiah the Messiah and I are one amen
[58:52] but then we have to examine ourselves
[58:55] are we walking in the faith or are we
[58:58] walking Connolly right are we walking
[59:01] after the Spirit of God or are we
[59:02] walking Connolly because if were walking
[59:03] calmly and we take it on wordly then
[59:06] we're drinking and eating damnation to
[59:07] ourselves right but if everything's
[59:10] under the blood right you made
[59:12] everything right amen then you have
[59:15] confidence to come forward and take it
[59:17] but isn't it precious we're in 2018
[59:21] God's mercy still on the earth God still
[59:24] finding his children God still winding
[59:26] up his plan of redemption God found us
[59:29] they meant God found us and he chose us
[59:33] we didn't choose him he came chasing
[59:36] after us we weren't chasing after him
[59:38] and he found us he got a hold of us I'll
[59:42] lose something gonna said yes Lord I
[59:43] give up make my take my life and make it
[59:46] my own
