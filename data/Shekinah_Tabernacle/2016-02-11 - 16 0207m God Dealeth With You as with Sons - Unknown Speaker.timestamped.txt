[12:57] mercy and Grace and Lord we want to
[13:00] thank you that it's not by our own
[13:01] ability that we approach you this
[13:03] morning but it's by your shed blood that
[13:05] you shed in our place oh God you gave
[13:08] your life that we could go free and dear
[13:11] Lord we see our brother Pete in hospital
[13:14] father we see the enemy is trying to
[13:16] take his life through this infection but
[13:19] Lord we have come to stand in the gap
[13:21] for him father that you would go Lord

[13:44] that day on Calvary you meant what you
[13:46] said Lord that every sickness would be
[13:48] healed Lord every Lord everyone who
[13:50] needed to be delivered would be
[13:51] delivered that day oh God and so father

[13:59] loose from his leg and that he would be
[14:01] raised up out of that bed father you
[14:04] would raise a faith in his heart that he
[14:05] would not not be discouraged but he had
[14:08] recognized the reason the enemy is
[14:09] Waring against him is because he's a Son
[14:12] of God dear Lord May Faith rise oh God
[14:15] may you send angels to minister to him
[14:17] oh Lord father that you would raise his
[14:19] faith oh God that he would not look at

[29:02] leave you know cuz the Rapture is real
[29:04] soon amen but um yeah praise the Lord
[29:07] this is a wonderful day and um so so uh
[29:12] Momi have decided to to call their son
[29:15] Elijah Del
[29:16] note amen I thought I thought what a
[29:19] what a powerful name you know what a
[29:22] powerful name we know Elijah I just want
[29:24] to read one scripture from First Kings
[29:26] chapter 18
[29:28] um if you if you have your Bibles handy
[29:31] if you want to read with me that's
[29:32] fine
[29:35] um you know it's
[29:38] a it's a um yeah First Kings chapter 18
[29:44] and this is this is Elijah on Mount
[29:45] carel in verse 37 and this is his prayer
[29:49] he says Hear Me Oh Lord hear me that
[29:53] this people may know that thou art the
[29:55] Lord God and that thou Hast turned their
[29:58] heart back again and we know that that
[30:01] God always uses the spirit of Elijah to
[30:03] turn the people's hearts back to God and
[30:06] I believe that's not only the desire of
[30:08] of Elijah that you know his life this is
[30:11] my prayer for him that that that as he
[30:13] grows the life in him would cause people
[30:16] to turn back towards God the life that
[30:19] he's living if he should T If he if God
[30:21] has ordained him to preach the preach
[30:23] this message that not only his words but
[30:26] his life would cause people to turn back
[30:27] to the Living God and I was thinking it
[30:30] also is very fitting of your family and
[30:32] where you've come from that his his name
[30:36] I mean you know Elijah the spirit of
[30:37] Elijah has turned you amen amen it's
[30:40] turned you you know to serve the Living
[30:41] God that's right amen so such a
[30:43] wonderful thing and and Elijah means my
[30:46] God uh my God is Yahweh my God is
[30:48] Jehovah that's such a declaration he's
[30:51] my Goda amen and then um and then D is
[30:55] is is named after your dad uh so your
[30:58] dad was Derek Charles and he said it's
[31:00] so in England it's it's it's short for D
[31:03] booy It's Made short to D boy so it's to
[31:05] honor you know our parents they do love
[31:08] us amen they do the best they can you
[31:10] know and what they do and I think it's I
[31:12] thought that was quite an honor to you
[31:14] know to give the middle name you know
[31:15] your dad's name to him amen then also
[31:18] the you the name no it's you know it's
[31:20] always interesting you know last
[31:22] names and the name noes is someone it's
[31:26] it's English and it's someone who who
[31:28] lived by some oak trees you may think
[31:30] well what does that got to do with a lot
[31:32] of things well brother baram he he he
[31:34] he's talking to to to brother Osborne
[31:37] and this is really where where where you
[31:39] both come in because we understand that
[31:41] a baby dedication is not just a
[31:43] dedication of the child but it's a
[31:44] dedication of the parents to raise the
[31:46] child in the way that he should go and
[31:49] so this is in 52 and early spiritual
[31:51] experiences brother Braham says now I
[31:53] said now look brother Osborne get
[31:56] started on the right foot now now you
[31:58] can make a lot of noise or anything and
[32:00] people will follow but remember your
[32:02] ministry you'll answer before God for it
[32:04] someday I said there sets an old oak
[32:07] tree on my porch referring to brother
[32:09] Bosworth and he was a he was a old
[32:12] brother in the faith at that time I said
[32:14] who knows about Divine Healing crawl up
[32:17] under the tree and talk to him a little
[32:19] while so brother bam instructed brother
[32:22] Bosworth to go and follow I mean sorry
[32:25] he instructed brother Osborne to follow
[32:27] brother Bosworth and learned the
[32:29] ministry from him and so an oak tree is
[32:31] a mature tree and my prayer when I read
[32:34] this was that you know Elijah is is is
[32:37] living with two Oaks two mature ones in
[32:40] the faith and what you look at and
[32:43] behold is what you become I mean so my
[32:46] prayer for for your family is that he
[32:48] would behold he would be truly he would
[32:50] live out his last name amen because it's
[32:53] not just Ministry that are Oaks I mean
[32:56] it's family it's it's moms and dads that
[32:58] the children can look at their parents
[33:00] and they and they can see a life and

[33:04] Dad amen so I pray that uh you'd always
[33:08] have a wonderful relationship with your
[33:09] son and and and with all your kids that
[33:12] they would see oak trees Amen in the

[1:07:35] do appreciate every one of you and glad
[1:07:39] to have each and every one of you here
[1:07:40] this morning it's been a wonderful
[1:07:42] atmosphere this weekend and I just feel
[1:07:45] it building from service to
[1:07:47] service and uh we're certainly looking
[1:07:50] to the Lord to uh do whatever he would
[1:07:54] have to do this morning before I turn to
[1:07:57] the word I just thought to share a
[1:07:59] couple of things with you uh many of you
[1:08:03] know that I once p pastored a church
[1:08:07] excuse me up in uh Grand Prairie Alberta
[1:08:11] which is Northern Canada and uh
[1:08:16] pastoring that church for 27 years uh
[1:08:20] then the Lord supernaturally changed
[1:08:22] events of my life to uh
[1:08:26] to cause me to move down to Cloverdale
[1:08:29] and begin to work with brother bcll in
[1:08:32] the missions work there in Cloverdale
[1:08:34] excuse
[1:08:38] me and
[1:08:40] uh he uh invited me to come after uh the
[1:08:45] events of my life had changed and we've
[1:08:48] been working with brother bis school
[1:08:49] since 2012 in
[1:08:51] missions
[1:08:53] now since we've been there or even
[1:08:56] before I got there there was a couple
[1:08:57] things that were done and I I thought
[1:09:00] just to bring to you uh a couple of
[1:09:03] things this morning just to uh give you
[1:09:05] something to pray about in the days
[1:09:07] ahead and and the work of the Lord one
[1:09:09] of the things that has been a great move
[1:09:11] of God is the uh the work of the Lord in
[1:09:14] China and uh some of you may be aware of
[1:09:17] it maybe followed the reports on the
[1:09:19] internet and that sort of thing but I
[1:09:22] wanted to bring to you something that
[1:09:24] that was a first
[1:09:26] uh as far as I know that is a Bible that
[1:09:30] has been translated by Believers that
[1:09:33] have received this
[1:09:35] message all right this is not done by a
[1:09:37] missions organization so to speak I mean
[1:09:39] we certainly have sponsored it but uh
[1:09:43] about 10 years ago the Believers in
[1:09:45] China begin to notice as they as they
[1:09:48] listen to the message and they compared
[1:09:50] it to their Bible that there were
[1:09:52] discrepancies between the Bible that
[1:09:54] brother brandham was read reading and
[1:09:56] the Bible that they had in China they
[1:09:59] only have one government approved Bible
[1:10:02] and that is what they call the union
[1:10:04] Bible and the union Bible is a
[1:10:06] translation that's missing a lot of uh
[1:10:09] key scriptures Miss and has a lot of
[1:10:11] Errors compared to the King James Bible
[1:10:15] and so the Believers begin to make
[1:10:17] notations of all of the errors that they
[1:10:19] found and they soon begin to number into
[1:10:23] the thousands of errors for example the
[1:10:26] the scripture in 1 John 5:7 that says
[1:10:29] you know there are three that bear
[1:10:31] record in heaven the Father the word and
[1:10:34] the spirit and these three are one the
[1:10:37] the the Chinese Bible doesn't even have
[1:10:40] that in their Bible and there's other
[1:10:42] scriptures that are missing some that
[1:10:44] are half missing and many grammatical
[1:10:46] and translation errors so about five
[1:10:48] years ago the Believers in China
[1:10:50] embarked on an ambitious translation
[1:10:53] project and the transl s begin to number
[1:10:57] almost uh the number of translators Rose
[1:11:00] to almost 30 translators that come
[1:11:03] comprised of of ministers and teachers
[1:11:06] and those that understood English
[1:11:08] amongst the Believers and finally this
[1:11:11] year we have published this Bible which
[1:11:14] is a first ever Bible translation in
[1:11:17] Chinese by
[1:11:18] Believers amen we thank God for that
[1:11:26] see there the brother brandom said the
[1:11:28] King James is my Bible and we love the
[1:11:32] King James Bible and and I won't go into
[1:11:34] all the uh the differences between the
[1:11:37] King James and other translations and
[1:11:39] all of that but suffice to say that that
[1:11:42] China never even had a doesn't even have
[1:11:45] a concordance they don't have
[1:11:47] dictionaries so they're unable to look
[1:11:49] at any meanings behind the words all
[1:11:51] they had was the government approved
[1:11:53] Bible and what we did is we put the King
[1:11:55] James Chinese translation in in a two
[1:11:59] column Bible right beside the existing
[1:12:01] Chinese translation so not only do they
[1:12:04] have the better translation they also
[1:12:07] can compare it to their old translation
[1:12:09] that they're used to and see the
[1:12:11] differences right there in front of them
[1:12:13] and so we thank God for that opportunity
[1:12:15] and it's being well received in China
[1:12:18] and uh and I brought one here with me
[1:12:21] and I uh I I heard from a brother that
[1:12:25] uh that his wife is Chinese and she's
[1:12:28] here uh this morning now I want that
[1:12:31] sister to have this Bible why don't you
[1:12:33] just come up here sister and come and
[1:12:34] get this
[1:12:46] Bible God bless you on behalf of the
[1:12:49] Believers in China God bless you amen
[1:12:52] praise the Lord
[1:13:03] if you want to have a look at that Bible
[1:13:04] just go and see that sister I'm sure
[1:13:06] she'd be happy to show it to you it's a
[1:13:08] very high quality Bible almost passed it
[1:13:10] around but I thought you know everybody'
[1:13:12] be looking at the Bible instead of
[1:13:13] looking at me
[1:13:15] so which might not be a bad thing I
[1:13:19] guess we every year we put out a
[1:13:21] missions uh report which is strictly
[1:13:24] Miss there's no Doctrine in here um and
[1:13:28] we we just uh uh bring a uh report to uh
[1:13:32] many of the things that are happening
[1:13:33] around the world that that not only that
[1:13:35] Bible Believers is sponsoring but some
[1:13:37] of of the works that other people are
[1:13:39] doing and and of course you can never
[1:13:41] have enough room to describe everything
[1:13:42] that God's doing but I bought a bunch
[1:13:45] here because they describe the work of
[1:13:47] the Chinese Bible and so we have this
[1:13:50] magazine I put it on the table by the
[1:13:52] entrance way where the message books are
[1:13:54] and the track are so if you want to pick
[1:13:56] one up I think I've got between 40
[1:13:59] around 40 of them so you can Avail
[1:14:01] yourself and obviously we got more than
[1:14:03] 40 people here so we'll say one per
[1:14:06] family I think that will be sufficient
[1:14:08] and uh if you want one you probably
[1:14:10] better hurry and get one because they're
[1:14:12] probably not enough for every family
[1:14:14] that's even in this place but I trust
[1:14:16] that it'll be a blessing to you you can
[1:14:18] read about the story behind it I thought
[1:14:20] that way I wouldn't have to describe it
[1:14:21] all to you and uh everything else that
[1:14:24] is happening one more thing I want I
[1:14:26] just want to share with you uh just
[1:14:28] because it's my first time to New
[1:14:30] Zealand who knows if I'll ever get here
[1:14:32] again but I want to just bring your
[1:14:35] attention to something that we've done
[1:14:37] again for the languages that are not
[1:14:40] English uh how many of you are familiar
[1:14:42] with the message Hub mobile website how
[1:14:45] many of you know about that well just a
[1:14:47] few of you we have a message site on the
[1:14:49] internet called messag hub. info I nfo
[1:14:54] and and on there we have the the message
[1:14:57] in
[1:14:58] 67 languages in printable form and so
[1:15:03] it's for people in missions work around
[1:15:05] the world that they can download it and
[1:15:07] print it right on their computer uh and
[1:15:10] we have uh do you have the other picture
[1:15:13] uh that that had showed the
[1:15:19] website maybe we could look at that one
[1:15:23] first no that that yeah messag hub.
[1:15:29] info if you would look at that just yeah
[1:15:32] that's it right
[1:15:35] there the very top very top did it
[1:15:39] perfect there we go all right this is
[1:15:41] the website that you'll see on the
[1:15:42] internet just click over to the English
[1:15:44] names on the second tab there top top up
[1:15:49] up up right there there we go I don't
[1:15:51] have the mouse here so I can't control
[1:15:53] it there we go so so there these are all
[1:15:55] of the languages that we have on the
[1:15:57] internet there and uh and we've we have
[1:16:01] maintained that for years but we just a
[1:16:05] couple years ago we began to work on a
[1:16:08] on an application for Android
[1:16:11] phones uh many people ask me brother Tim
[1:16:14] is it available on iPhone and I say no
[1:16:17] I'm sorry it's not two reasons I said
[1:16:23] um one of them is that that uh 90% of
[1:16:27] the world are on Android
[1:16:29] phones and iPhone is is probably I got
[1:16:33] one
[1:16:35] amen the rest of you are on iPhones I
[1:16:38] assume which is a good thing for my next
[1:16:41] comment because iPhones are largely a
[1:16:43] first world phenomena and uh those that
[1:16:47] have iPhones have a lot of
[1:16:51] money you got my point and uh we'd love
[1:16:55] to get it over to iPhone but it's going
[1:16:57] to take some money and and so uh but we
[1:16:59] got it on Android and we've used our
[1:17:01] resources to do that and you can go to
[1:17:04] the other picture if you would and it's
[1:17:06] available for free on the uh Google Play
[1:17:08] Store and it's an
[1:17:11] application that uh and I'm going to
[1:17:13] actually pull it up on my phone and uh
[1:17:16] those of you that are at the front will
[1:17:17] be able to see it a little bit we have
[1:17:21] on this
[1:17:22] application 12 languages already ready
[1:17:25] and more being loaded as we speak so
[1:17:28] we're taking the languages off the
[1:17:29] message Hub and putting it into a into a
[1:17:33] uh application for Android phones you
[1:17:36] can go and download it on on Google Play
[1:17:38] If there if there's more than one
[1:17:39] brother that has an Android phone and uh
[1:17:43] uh there you'll find you can choose any
[1:17:45] or all of the translate uh the languages
[1:17:48] that are there such as uh we have of
[1:17:51] course the English language but we have
[1:17:53] the Chinese the Dutch Polish Russian
[1:17:56] Vietnamese French Indonesian Croatian
[1:17:59] Slovenian Slovakian Serbian and the same
[1:18:03] thing is available in all the languages
[1:18:05] in one application all right now what
[1:18:08] what it is it's a bible-based
[1:18:09] application so and I'll just show it the
[1:18:12] people at the front will be able to see
[1:18:14] it I just pull up the Bible here which
[1:18:17] is what you see here on the screen and
[1:18:20] I'll I'll maybe show it to the young
[1:18:21] people they can they can kind of see
[1:18:23] that and so you see the Bible comes up
[1:18:25] there but you see the little blue
[1:18:26] numbers beside the verses all right
[1:18:28] there's some little blue numbers there
[1:18:30] that are beside the verses those are
[1:18:32] links to the message those are the momas
[1:18:35] links that brother momas developed and
[1:18:38] uh sister momas uh graciously allowed us
[1:18:40] to have them so that if a person just
[1:18:43] presses on that link you just press on
[1:18:46] that number there it takes you right
[1:18:48] into the places where brother brandham
[1:18:50] mentions that
[1:18:51] scripture and so it lists the quotes
[1:18:54] where brother brandham talks about that
[1:18:56] particular scripture and so then if you
[1:18:59] actually click on that uh on that quote
[1:19:02] any one of the quotes on the list it
[1:19:04] then takes you right into the full
[1:19:07] message all right it's very simple and
[1:19:09] the reason we made it simple is to be
[1:19:11] attractive especially to new Believers
[1:19:15] all right it's it is searchable so that
[1:19:17] anyone that has it in their language can
[1:19:19] search the message in their language so
[1:19:21] it gives all of these languages a
[1:19:24] searchable application that they never
[1:19:26] had before all right and that's great
[1:19:28] for many reasons as we know because
[1:19:30] doctrinal errors are solved by giving
[1:19:32] people the
[1:19:34] message it's just that simple and so uh
[1:19:37] it's not a matter of us of teaching we
[1:19:40] have to teach we we need to preach and
[1:19:42] we need to bring out the things of the
[1:19:43] message but even as preaching the
[1:19:45] preaching should make the people hungry
[1:19:48] for the
[1:19:49] message more hungry not less hungry for
[1:19:52] the message because it's the message is
[1:19:55] the love letter of God to his bride to
[1:19:59] get us ready for the
[1:20:00] Rapture amen so so in reality form what
[1:20:05] we have here is all of these Bibles in
[1:20:07] these different languages it's a Bible
[1:20:09] app and the inspiration came from the
[1:20:11] Chinese people because the Chinese
[1:20:14] people are Avid readers on their
[1:20:16] smartphones what we call these
[1:20:18] smartphones or tablets or whatever it
[1:20:19] might be and so they like to read and so
[1:20:22] it it it's in China
[1:20:25] uh Chinese was the first language that
[1:20:27] we added and then linking to the message
[1:20:30] it makes brother brandham the commentary
[1:20:33] on the
[1:20:34] Bible and so that's a powerful thing for
[1:20:37] the last day's message amen so so
[1:20:41] somebody might not be a believer might
[1:20:43] download the app down get a free Bible
[1:20:45] app and it links them right into the
[1:20:47] message of the hour and if there's any
[1:20:49] predestinated seed there there's enough
[1:20:51] power to Quicken that
[1:20:53] seed and so those are some of the things
[1:20:55] that we're doing again I'm not going to
[1:20:57] go into everything I just wanted to
[1:20:59] share those two things that I think are
[1:21:01] impactful to everybody around the world
[1:21:04] and uh would you just remember us in
[1:21:07] prayer uh we don't send the the faith
[1:21:10] challenge reports around the world
[1:21:12] anymore the the postage from Canada has
[1:21:14] gotten extremely expensive but I brought
[1:21:16] a few with me and I trust that they'll
[1:21:18] be a blessing to you
[1:21:25] you know the Lord has has opened a lot
[1:21:26] of his word already this
[1:21:29] weekend you know it's been the meetings
[1:21:31] have been full I I've been amazed at at
[1:21:34] how much you've
[1:21:36] pulled uh not not surprised amazed and
[1:21:41] you know I believe
[1:21:42] God's bride is in love with the
[1:21:47] word because the word in spirit form is
[1:21:50] her
[1:21:52] bridegroom and so the bride loves the
[1:21:56] bridegroom and that's what we're here to
[1:21:59] minister and any minister is not to get
[1:22:02] in between the bride and the bridegroom
[1:22:05] but it's to connect the bride directly
[1:22:08] to the bridegroom and so we we
[1:22:11] appreciate that in every Ministry that
[1:22:13] God uh brings into the body of Jesus
[1:22:16] Christ you know I I always tell the
[1:22:18] brothers at home I said we all have
[1:22:20] unique gifts and it and it ranges in the
[1:22:22] Spectrum it's there's apostles prophets
[1:22:25] evangelist pastors teachers everybody
[1:22:27] has their unique gift and it ranges all
[1:22:29] the way from teachers on one end of the
[1:22:31] spectrum to evangelists on the other end
[1:22:34] of the spectrum and the reason I say it
[1:22:36] that way is because when evangelists
[1:22:39] over here look at teachers they say
[1:22:41] they're too
[1:22:42] intellectual and when teachers way over
[1:22:45] here look at evangelists they're too
[1:22:47] emotional and so you know everybody
[1:22:50] looks at each other through their own
[1:22:52] eyes and there's nobody if they're
[1:22:55] called of God we don't want to be too
[1:22:57] intellectual or too emotional but there
[1:23:00] is a mind of Christ that we all want to
[1:23:03] enter into and be what God has made us
[1:23:07] to
[1:23:07] be so I trust that as every member of
[1:23:11] the body yields themsel whether it be a
[1:23:13] minister or whether it be another member
[1:23:15] of the body that God will use you for
[1:23:17] the full purpose that he has designed to
[1:23:20] accomplish in your life amen how many
[1:23:23] want to be useful in the kingdom of God
[1:23:26] you know there's enough power in this
[1:23:28] message to transform a life transformed
[1:23:31] yours transform mine praise be to God
[1:23:35] it'll transform somebody else's somebody
[1:23:37] just told me one day about serpent seed
[1:23:40] it was somebody it's a long story I
[1:23:41] won't go into it but uh that was the
[1:23:44] what caught me when when somebody who
[1:23:47] had only been in the message for six
[1:23:50] months told me what serpent seed was it
[1:23:54] totally changed the course of my life
[1:23:57] and and so I saw the original sin saw
[1:23:59] many other things in the
[1:24:01] Bible and God has a way of doing it that
[1:24:06] he knows how to catch somebody don't
[1:24:07] ever be ashamed of the message of the
[1:24:12] hour I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of
[1:24:15] Jesus Christ for it is the power of God
[1:24:19] un salvation to them that
[1:24:21] believe amen
[1:24:25] are you ready this morning for the
[1:24:27] word amen let's take our Bibles and turn
[1:24:30] to Hebrews chapter
[1:24:34] 12 you can stand with me if you like in
[1:24:37] honor of the
[1:24:41] word as we read our opening scripture
[1:24:44] you know we find in the places of the
[1:24:46] Bible like in Ezra and Nehemiah the
[1:24:48] people stood the whole
[1:24:51] service but we probably wouldn't be able
[1:24:53] to preach as long if we if we did that
[1:24:56] but we have the Comfort we enjoy you
[1:24:59] know back we have uh in our a lot of our
[1:25:02] churches we have air conditioning you
[1:25:05] know when we come into a warm place like
[1:25:07] this we need fans here there everywhere
[1:25:10] blowing on us and we appreciate that
[1:25:12] because we've come to a very hybrid age
[1:25:16] and these bodies don't have the stamina
[1:25:18] and the and the strength that they used
[1:25:20] to have and there's a lot of different
[1:25:22] reasons for that but I believe the word
[1:25:26] is more powerful in this age than it has
[1:25:29] ever
[1:25:30] been and and though men have grown
[1:25:33] weaker and wiser I believe that God has
[1:25:36] sent a message to draw us closer to the
[1:25:39] Lord Jesus Christ than any age has ever
[1:25:42] been I appreciate brother Andy's
[1:25:44] comments about energy and and strength
[1:25:48] and I'm going to take that home with me
[1:25:50] I'm going to use that and uh you know we
[1:25:52] ought to give him the Bible says what is
[1:25:55] the greatest
[1:25:56] commandment the greatest commandment if
[1:25:58] you love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:26:00] heart with all thy mind with all thy
[1:26:03] soul and with all thy
[1:26:07] strength that's the greatest commandment
[1:26:09] of all let's just bow our heads together
[1:26:11] in a word of
[1:26:13] prayer wonderful
[1:26:15] Redeemer king of kings and Lord of
[1:26:19] lords you are the Prince of Peace you're
[1:26:22] the almighty one
[1:26:24] you're the creator of heavens and earth
[1:26:27] Lord we call you the rose of Sharon the
[1:26:29] lily of the valley the bride and Morning
[1:26:32] Star we rejoice in your presence oh God
[1:26:36] because of how great you are and it's
[1:26:39] been so well described in song it's been
[1:26:42] described in exhortations but Lord we
[1:26:45] want father not to describe it by your
[1:26:48] word but we want you to come and reveal
[1:26:51] yourself to us personally through your
[1:26:54] word father oh Lord only you are the
[1:26:59] discerner of the thoughts of our hearts
[1:27:02] there is no secret hidden from you oh
[1:27:05] God so come by our way this morning oh
[1:27:08] Lord and make yourself known unto us as
[1:27:11] only you can father the preacher can
[1:27:14] speak what word you have put into him
[1:27:17] Lord as you would anoint it and Inspire
[1:27:19] it but it still takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:27:22] take that word and signify it in the
[1:27:25] hearts and minds of the people Lord
[1:27:28] we're relying on you this morning to
[1:27:30] just bring about the fullness of the
[1:27:32] measure of what you would accomplish
[1:27:34] today Lord we have this little bit of
[1:27:37] time this morning we're surrendering it
[1:27:40] to you Lord focus our minds focus our
[1:27:44] thoughts because Lord we love
[1:27:47] you you've blessed us so much hallu
[1:27:51] you've given us so many things oh God
[1:27:54] we feel like as we said in the first
[1:27:56] service though you cast us into hell we
[1:27:59] still love you Lord Lord we pray that
[1:28:02] you'll just anoint the reading and the
[1:28:04] speaking of your word for your glory in
[1:28:07] Jesus Christ's name
[1:28:10] amen Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[1:28:16] 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation
[1:28:19] that speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:28:21] or we could say
[1:28:22] Sons my son despise not thou the
[1:28:25] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[1:28:28] thou art rebuked of him for whom the
[1:28:31] Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges
[1:28:35] every son that he receiveth that word
[1:28:39] receiveth means to acknowledge as his
[1:28:43] own if you endure chastening God deals
[1:28:47] with you as with sons for what son is he
[1:28:52] whom the father Chase not but if you be
[1:28:56] without chastisement whereof all are
[1:28:59] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:29:01] Sons furthermore we have had fathers of
[1:29:04] our flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:29:07] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:29:09] be in subjection unto the father of
[1:29:11] spirits and live for they verily for a
[1:29:14] few days chastened us after their own
[1:29:17] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[1:29:20] might be partakers of his holiness and
[1:29:24] that word Holiness is not necessarily
[1:29:26] just holy living but it's his nature
[1:29:29] that we might be partakers of his holy
[1:29:32] nature and now it says now no chastening
[1:29:35] for the present seems to be joyous but
[1:29:39] Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:29:42] yields the Peaceable fruit of
[1:29:44] righteousness unto them which are
[1:29:48] exercised thereby amen the Lord add his
[1:29:51] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[1:29:59] amen you can put up the the PowerPoint
[1:30:01] if you would for me right away I want to
[1:30:03] speak about the name of the sons of God
[1:30:07] and God dealing with you as with sons is
[1:30:11] my subject and and we're we're wanting
[1:30:14] to we're living in the time as I think
[1:30:17] uh brother Ben said the other day we're
[1:30:19] we're in the ripening of the crop the
[1:30:22] crop the wheat uh we know Matthew
[1:30:25] Chapter 13 describes the two seeds that
[1:30:28] were swn and how that there was tear swn
[1:30:30] and wheat swn and in the last days the
[1:30:34] the or in the beginning the reaper said
[1:30:36] should we pull the tears out and he said
[1:30:38] no let them grow together until the last
[1:30:41] days and then gather first the tears and
[1:30:44] they'll be bundled and burned and that's
[1:30:46] what's happened in these last days first
[1:30:48] the tears are being bound even right out
[1:30:51] of the message see they it's got to
[1:30:53] happen that that the Reapers would come
[1:30:55] and separate the false seed from amongst
[1:30:58] the ranks of the wheat and so we see
[1:31:01] that even happening within the message
[1:31:03] because they must be bound to
[1:31:05] denominationalism that's why they can as
[1:31:08] we say go back to denomination because
[1:31:12] they're actually not of the wheat they
[1:31:13] look like wheat but as the wheat matures
[1:31:17] it shows the difference between the
[1:31:19] tears and the wheat and so now as the
[1:31:22] tears are separated out then the wheat
[1:31:24] lays in the presence of the sun to ripen
[1:31:27] all the greenness out of her we've been
[1:31:28] laying in the presence of the revealed
[1:31:31] word the es n of God to take all of the
[1:31:34] greenness out of our lives and bring us
[1:31:36] to a maturity because God is not
[1:31:39] marrying a little
[1:31:41] girl he's marrying a mature woman one
[1:31:45] that has become the word on display in
[1:31:48] her day and so when we speak of maturity
[1:31:53] we are speak speaking of God bringing us
[1:31:55] to a place that he can fully reflect
[1:31:58] himself through us because the woman is
[1:32:01] the glory of the husband
[1:32:04] amen amen are we here this morning amen
[1:32:08] the woman is the glory of the husband
[1:32:11] amen the church is the glory of Christ
[1:32:14] he's separating out everything that's
[1:32:15] false because this church will truly
[1:32:18] reflect his glory as the scripture says
[1:32:21] from glory to glory we are changed as
[1:32:24] into his glorious image and so we're
[1:32:27] coming now into that time where the
[1:32:30] fullness of the word is not just
[1:32:32] revealed but it must be on
[1:32:36] display all right so it's not just
[1:32:39] character but its usefulness in this
[1:32:43] world God displaying himself and
[1:32:45] manifesting himself in this world now on
[1:32:49] the other side there are no
[1:32:52] babies no babes in Christ all right it's
[1:32:56] this side that there are babes in Christ
[1:32:59] but the word comes to mature us into the
[1:33:02] very image of Christ now let's just deal
[1:33:06] with this a little bit from the the
[1:33:08] approach of Hebrews chapter
[1:33:10] 12 it says now no chastening for the
[1:33:13] present Seth to be joyous but Grievious
[1:33:16] nevertheless
[1:33:18] afterward after your chastised anybody
[1:33:21] here ever been spanked before
[1:33:24] praise the Lord there I don't think
[1:33:26] there's any child welfare people in here
[1:33:28] so you can don't need to be ashamed to
[1:33:30] raise your hand and uh you know I I
[1:33:33] think most of us that are at least come
[1:33:35] to the age of accountability have been
[1:33:37] spanked before and uh why it's
[1:33:40] chastening that for a few days we were
[1:33:42] chastened by our Earthly parents and
[1:33:45] it's but a few days certainly when you
[1:33:47] reach my age you realize my youth was
[1:33:50] too short and as one person said the
[1:33:53] thing about you is that it's wasted on
[1:33:54] the
[1:33:56] youth let that one sink in for a little
[1:33:59] bit all
[1:34:00] right and so we realize excuse me for
[1:34:03] saying that young people all right and
[1:34:06] so we realize that God has a purpose and
[1:34:08] he Likens it to our Earthly existence
[1:34:10] but God chastens with nail scarred hands
[1:34:15] all right his chastening is different
[1:34:17] than our Earthly parents because our
[1:34:19] Earthly parents do it for their own
[1:34:23] purpose
[1:34:24] but God does it that he might reflect
[1:34:27] himself within us praise be to God and
[1:34:31] so we realize now that that there's a
[1:34:33] chastening now I want you to catch this
[1:34:35] afterwards it yieldeth the Peaceable
[1:34:38] fruit of righteousness unto them that
[1:34:41] are exercised thereby I want to take
[1:34:44] this term exercised thereby so there's
[1:34:47] there's something that happens there's a
[1:34:49] process that takes place that begins to
[1:34:52] exercise as Paul says here let's let's
[1:34:55] just take the the scripture now and jump
[1:34:58] to chapter 5 and verse 12 I have it up
[1:35:01] here on the screen for you as Paul
[1:35:03] speaks to the Hebrew church he says for
[1:35:05] when the time you ought to be teachers
[1:35:08] you have need that one teach you again
[1:35:11] what which be the first principles of
[1:35:14] the Oracles of God and are become such
[1:35:16] as have need of milk and not of strong
[1:35:19] meat so as he's speaking to the Hebrew
[1:35:20] Church he's saying you ought to be a
[1:35:22] whole lot more mature than you are now
[1:35:24] you ought to have come up a lot further
[1:35:26] than you've come now but you know uh
[1:35:29] there are those that are capable of
[1:35:31] taking strong meat he says for everyone
[1:35:33] that uses milk and this is a babe in
[1:35:36] Christ is
[1:35:38] unskillful in the word of
[1:35:41] righteousness all right it's not that
[1:35:43] he's not a Believer it's not that he's
[1:35:46] born again when you're born again you're
[1:35:49] a babe in Christ but he's unskillful in
[1:35:52] the word of righteousness for he is a
[1:35:55] babe but strong meat belongeth to them
[1:35:59] that are of full age and the word full
[1:36:03] age there means mature all right even
[1:36:07] those who by reason of use have their
[1:36:11] senses exercised there's that
[1:36:13] terminology again to discern both good
[1:36:16] and evil so when you're born again you
[1:36:19] have a certain level of discernment but
[1:36:22] as you grow in Christ God works on you
[1:36:26] to bring you to a maturity to recognize
[1:36:29] what is good and what is evil as the
[1:36:32] Apostle Paul says all things are
[1:36:35] lawful but not all things are
[1:36:39] expedient not everything edifies our
[1:36:42] lives or edifies the body of Jesus
[1:36:45] Christ many times as we're just babes in
[1:36:47] Christ and and certainly our young
[1:36:49] people growing up within the church they
[1:36:51] say well what's really wrong with this
[1:36:53] or what's really want wrong with that
[1:36:55] well the those that are a little more
[1:36:57] mature in the word they realize those
[1:36:59] things won't edify you those things
[1:37:02] won't Build You Up they might not
[1:37:04] necessarily be evil within themselves
[1:37:06] there's a lot of things that are not
[1:37:07] evil within themselves but if they get
[1:37:09] away in the way of our growth in Christ
[1:37:13] then they are
[1:37:15] evil anything that gets between us and
[1:37:18] God is an
[1:37:19] idol he's to be our first love and he's
[1:37:22] very jealous over the Bride of Jesus
[1:37:24] Christ in the Amplified version we'll
[1:37:27] pick up these two verses in in chapter 5
[1:37:30] it says but solid food is for full grown
[1:37:33] men for those whose senses and mental
[1:37:36] faculties are trained by practice to
[1:37:39] discriminate and distinguish between
[1:37:41] what is morally good and Noble and what
[1:37:44] is evil and contrary to either Divine or
[1:37:47] human law all right so notice what's
[1:37:50] contrary to not just those things which
[1:37:52] are spiritual but but also to those
[1:37:54] things which are natural the things that
[1:37:56] are good for you spiritually and
[1:37:58] naturally amen you reach a certain age
[1:38:01] brother ELR you're probably not there
[1:38:03] yet but you reach a certain age where
[1:38:06] where you realize it's time for me to
[1:38:07] take care of my body you know when
[1:38:10] you're young you eat all the sweets you
[1:38:12] want to you you eat all the fast food
[1:38:15] that you want to am I the only one that
[1:38:18] ever did
[1:38:19] that anybody here like McDonald's sure
[1:38:23] how many out there like McDonald's
[1:38:25] that's a less percentage isn't it why
[1:38:28] anybody over here like McDonald's all
[1:38:30] right I'm not promoting McDonald's here
[1:38:32] this morning but we realize that at this
[1:38:34] age we all love I used to love
[1:38:36] McDonald's too that's all right their
[1:38:38] milkshakes are awesome and and so you
[1:38:40] know we used to go to McDonald's I used
[1:38:42] to eat all the McDonald's have a Big Mac
[1:38:44] have a quarter pounder with cheese have
[1:38:45] french fries have milkshakes now if I
[1:38:48] ate that my body would tell me you have
[1:38:50] done the wrong thing
[1:38:56] all right I just can't handle it the way
[1:38:57] I used to handle it why because there's
[1:39:00] been a maturity in a growth and
[1:39:02] realizing that the things that I did in
[1:39:04] my youth I'm now paying the price for
[1:39:07] All right so so we do a lot of things
[1:39:10] without moderation and everything and
[1:39:12] you know as brother brandham says even
[1:39:14] we have to learn that you can do
[1:39:16] anything too much except
[1:39:20] pray all right and so we realize that
[1:39:23] prayer is the most important thing that
[1:39:25] we can spend our time on all right and
[1:39:29] so that means then that we could even
[1:39:30] study too much and brother brandom says
[1:39:32] in one place he says I realize that
[1:39:34] people do study too much you know they
[1:39:37] put there try and figure things out they
[1:39:39] try and place things he says you don't
[1:39:41] need to do that he says you just need to
[1:39:43] love the Lord and walk on loving the
[1:39:46] Lord he said that's what it's all about
[1:39:49] you see this is a supernatural walk not
[1:39:52] an intellectual walk
[1:39:54] it's a personal relationship with the
[1:39:56] Lord Jesus Christ and as I begin to
[1:39:59] teach these things today I want you to
[1:40:01] realize that it's not about you
[1:40:03] understanding how to do things but it's
[1:40:05] so you can understand how to have a
[1:40:07] better relationship with the Lord Jesus
[1:40:09] Christ amen how many of you have been
[1:40:12] married here more than seven years all
[1:40:15] right praise the Lord she's your fault
[1:40:17] Brothers all right
[1:40:19] now we realize in marriage that it's a
[1:40:22] process when we're first married you
[1:40:25] know we're just so in love that we
[1:40:27] Overlook each other's faults and we
[1:40:28] Overlook our own inability to
[1:40:31] communicate and so the wife allows the
[1:40:33] husband to do certain things the husband
[1:40:35] allows the wife to do certain things
[1:40:36] that maybe in themselves are a little
[1:40:38] bit hurtful but they don't notice it so
[1:40:40] much because there's just this great
[1:40:41] overwhelming atmosphere of Love But as
[1:40:44] time goes on and these things accumulate
[1:40:46] pretty soon we understand in the
[1:40:47] relationship you know what if you keep
[1:40:49] doing that you're going to give me a
[1:40:51] complex if you keep treating me that way
[1:40:54] you know that that's not going to suit
[1:40:56] me very well and so then we begin to
[1:40:58] communicate and we begin to discuss we
[1:41:00] begin to our love begins to grow because
[1:41:03] we begin to understand each other better
[1:41:07] is that right and as we begin understand
[1:41:09] each other better then the marriage
[1:41:11] relationship grows and it grows and it
[1:41:15] grows amen I don't see brother Tony and
[1:41:17] his wife they're probably sitting at the
[1:41:19] back this morning oh they're right at
[1:41:21] the front here I look right past them
[1:41:24] oh you're brave you're very brave and uh
[1:41:27] you know they as they said last night
[1:41:29] they love each other more now than they
[1:41:31] did when they first got married amen
[1:41:33] we're all the same way and so we realize
[1:41:36] there's a growth in it that we are
[1:41:39] trained say Hebrews chapter 12 says for
[1:41:42] the time being no discipline brings Joy
[1:41:46] nobody's happy when Dad says get to your
[1:41:49] room I'll be there in a minute
[1:41:53] I I could just tell by the reaction
[1:41:54] who's heard those
[1:41:57] words amen I'll meet you there as he
[1:42:00] takes his belt off and whatever else he
[1:42:02] uses for discipline or whatever I don't
[1:42:05] know if I'm contravening the laws of New
[1:42:06] Zealand actually when I say
[1:42:09] that but you know it's not very pleasant
[1:42:13] when you hear those words there's no joy
[1:42:16] there's nobody that says yes
[1:42:21] Dad I've been waiting for this all
[1:42:25] day amen why not there's no joy in
[1:42:27] discipline there's no joy in getting
[1:42:29] spanked there's no joy in getting
[1:42:31] grounded there's no joy in having your
[1:42:33] cell phone taken
[1:42:35] away I'm just giving you an
[1:42:40] idea praise the Lord there's no joy in
[1:42:43] those things but seems Grievious and
[1:42:46] painful I remember when I was there but
[1:42:49] afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit
[1:42:52] of righteousness to those who have been
[1:42:55] trained by it all right now let's go to
[1:42:58] the
[1:42:59] spiritual because we realize that in the
[1:43:02] spiritual as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:04] we are born as babies in Christ you know
[1:43:06] God said concerning his bride in in
[1:43:08] Ezekiel chapter 16 I believe it is he
[1:43:10] says I found you in the field in your
[1:43:12] own blood what's he talking about a
[1:43:14] newborn baby he says I washed you I
[1:43:18] suckled you I I clothed you I I did all
[1:43:21] this for you and you grew up and you
[1:43:23] matured and so on and so forth what was
[1:43:26] that you started out as a babe but I
[1:43:28] took care of you in your baby condition
[1:43:30] that wasn't the time of Love maturity
[1:43:33] was the time of love but there was a
[1:43:35] time that I watched over you and watched
[1:43:37] over your every footstep and all of
[1:43:39] those kind of things because we realize
[1:43:41] in the spiritual realm there must come a
[1:43:44] maturity that God is looking for now he
[1:43:46] has to in order to bring us maturity he
[1:43:48] has to train us what's good and what's
[1:43:50] not good what's good for us what's not
[1:43:52] good good for us what will lead us to
[1:43:54] where he wants us to be which is the
[1:43:57] greatest place of
[1:43:58] pleasure on what will take us away from
[1:44:01] God and is the greatest place of grief
[1:44:04] and suffering and so as God leads us to
[1:44:08] the right place he trains Us in that
[1:44:11] because we must have the right character
[1:44:14] to receive the blessings of God we
[1:44:17] realize that character is not a gift
[1:44:20] it's a victory statements that we're
[1:44:23] familiar with and so at being a victory
[1:44:25] we have to go through some things
[1:44:27] because power without character is
[1:44:30] demonic but Power with character is fit
[1:44:33] to rule to him that overcometh will I
[1:44:37] grant to sit with me where in my Throne
[1:44:40] so this is the hour of the greatest
[1:44:43] power that's been loosed in the church
[1:44:45] but it's also required that the church
[1:44:48] have greater character than any other
[1:44:51] age that's why the Saints in the in the
[1:44:54] in the church ages God could wink at
[1:44:55] their ignorance because God wasn't
[1:44:57] pouring into them the full revelation of
[1:44:59] the word their lives were would fall
[1:45:02] short as a I think brother Ben said you
[1:45:04] know if Luther was here we'd say this
[1:45:06] guy needs to get to the altar you know
[1:45:09] he needs a further work of God in his
[1:45:10] life you know Wesley the same way and
[1:45:12] different ones and the attitudes that
[1:45:14] they have but now God is perfecting our
[1:45:17] character because he's brought the
[1:45:18] fullness of the word the title deed and
[1:45:22] the power which the title deed operates
[1:45:25] there's so much more potential within
[1:45:27] the church than ever
[1:45:30] before
[1:45:32] now how many believe that there's more
[1:45:35] Revelation in the church in this age
[1:45:38] than any other
[1:45:39] age all right now that means it's at
[1:45:43] your
[1:45:44] fingertips now what did the Apostle Paul
[1:45:47] said he said lest I be
[1:45:50] exalted by the abundance abundance of
[1:45:54] Revelation there was given to me a thorn
[1:45:57] in the
[1:45:58] flesh a messenger of Satan to Buffet
[1:46:03] me why was he saying that he says
[1:46:05] because of all that God was revealing to
[1:46:08] me God also had to make me suffer to
[1:46:11] keep me
[1:46:14] humble because all that God is revealing
[1:46:18] to you he has to take you through trials
[1:46:22] and testing to keep you
[1:46:25] humble see we want the power and the
[1:46:29] Revelation without the character or the
[1:46:32] suffering that makes the character
[1:46:34] because simply said as brother brandham
[1:46:36] said in the church ages character is not
[1:46:39] made without
[1:46:43] suffering that's sure not pleasant is
[1:46:46] it I was reading an article here not
[1:46:49] long ago and and uh it was an
[1:46:52] interesting perspective because it's
[1:46:54] especially for a worldly person and they
[1:46:57] said you know often we ask the question
[1:47:00] what do you want out of
[1:47:02] life what do you want out of life we
[1:47:05] often ask the young people that what do
[1:47:07] you what do you want to get out of life
[1:47:10] I want to let them sink that sink in a
[1:47:12] little bit where where do you want to
[1:47:13] end up at you know maybe the sisters
[1:47:15] would say well you know I I want to be a
[1:47:17] housewife and I want to have children I
[1:47:19] want to have a nice home a nice car all
[1:47:20] those sorts of things the brothers might
[1:47:22] say you know I want to a nice career I
[1:47:24] want to have a a good paying job that
[1:47:26] that maybe would make me uh some money
[1:47:28] or maybe I want to go into business or I
[1:47:30] want to drive a fancy car uh I don't
[1:47:32] know what a fancy car is down here in
[1:47:34] New Zealand and you know I want to drive
[1:47:36] a a Lamborghini or a Maserati or or a
[1:47:39] Corvette or yeah Smiles are coming on
[1:47:41] their faces now and uh you know I I want
[1:47:44] to you know have these kind of things
[1:47:46] and he says but really that's not the
[1:47:48] right question the guy in the article
[1:47:50] said so the real question is what are
[1:47:53] you willing to
[1:47:56] suffer cuz a lot of times we go it's not
[1:48:00] where we're going it's what price we're
[1:48:02] willing to pay to get
[1:48:05] there all right I likened it to to some
[1:48:08] brothers in our some young Brothers in
[1:48:10] our church who are known to be very
[1:48:12] athletic and and love to work out
[1:48:14] anybody work out on weights so so can't
[1:48:17] tell
[1:48:19] um I'm just I'm just teasing you
[1:48:24] can't tell that I work out either can
[1:48:28] you but there's some brothers in our
[1:48:30] church I'm so sorry for that I'm sorry I
[1:48:32] said that that just kind of slipped out
[1:48:34] you H me one I'll buy you lunch all
[1:48:38] right now as we as we look at these kind
[1:48:42] of things these young Brothers I got a
[1:48:44] couple young Brothers in the church they
[1:48:46] get up at 5:00 in the morning and they
[1:48:48] go to the gym and they work out they run
[1:48:51] they do their exercises they push
[1:48:53] weights all those kind of things and I
[1:48:55] got there's one young brother in the
[1:48:56] church and I'll just say this for his
[1:48:58] benefit if he knows I told you he'd kill
[1:48:59] me but you know he came to my house one
[1:49:01] time when I still lived in the north and
[1:49:03] tried to work out on my weights and just
[1:49:04] about killed himself and you know it's
[1:49:07] just an exercise physical exercise
[1:49:09] profiteth little but but he since then
[1:49:13] it it motivated him to work harder and
[1:49:15] push weights and he's he's very strong
[1:49:17] and very athletic why aren't you very
[1:49:20] strong and very athletic brother ALR
[1:49:27] I'll tell you why all right I'll give
[1:49:28] you the secret because you're not
[1:49:30] willing to pay the
[1:49:32] price it's the same reason I'm not I'm
[1:49:35] not willing to give up the chocolate
[1:49:39] cake I'm not willing to give up the
[1:49:41] sweets I'm not willing to give up the
[1:49:42] food I'm not willing to get up at 5:00
[1:49:44] a.m. just to go to the gym and
[1:49:47] sweat see there's a the point is there's
[1:49:49] a price to pay there's something what
[1:49:52] are you willing to suffer to get what
[1:49:55] you want you know there I I was over in
[1:49:58] in uh Europe uh a couple years ago
[1:50:01] preaching at a convention and I stopped
[1:50:03] I actually took my children to visit the
[1:50:05] Canadian Army Cemetery from the second
[1:50:08] world war actually first and second
[1:50:10] world war and uh and there was a lot of
[1:50:14] names on a lot of tombstones I forget
[1:50:17] how many thousand were there and I was
[1:50:20] looking at the names you know like John
[1:50:23] Smith or Fred Adams or something and the
[1:50:26] AG is 21 years
[1:50:28] old 19 years
[1:50:31] old 22 years old a father a
[1:50:35] husband all right left behind wives some
[1:50:39] of them single their whole life ahead of
[1:50:41] them but they gave their life for a
[1:50:45] cause there were willing to pay the
[1:50:48] price in their thoughts it was worth
[1:50:51] their life to give give for freedom in
[1:50:54] Europe all right we don't know those
[1:50:57] kind of things right now but I I'll say
[1:50:59] to all of you and especially to the
[1:51:00] young people what's worth your
[1:51:03] life you're you've got your whole life
[1:51:05] ahead of you but what's worth it what's
[1:51:08] worth spending everything that you are I
[1:51:10] want to tell you this gospel is worth
[1:51:14] it this message is worth every ounce of
[1:51:17] energy that you can pour into it this is
[1:51:20] the only transforming power of God in
[1:51:23] this
[1:51:23] generation and giving your life to it I
[1:51:26] see Sister Christine raising her hand
[1:51:28] back there and she was telling me how
[1:51:29] that God revealed to her what her hus
[1:51:32] who her husband was to be and how that
[1:51:34] all worked in their marriage
[1:51:35] relationship and and I said to brother
[1:51:37] Ben afterwards I says the reason that
[1:51:40] she uh I or at least I believe the
[1:51:42] reason that God had to reveal to her
[1:51:45] even more supernaturally than he
[1:51:46] revealed it to you was because the wife
[1:51:49] of a pastor has a heavy load amen amen
[1:51:53] and there's a great I know what that is
[1:51:55] it's there's a great price to be paid by
[1:51:58] a pastor's wife constantly in
[1:52:00] Hospitality constantly raising children
[1:52:02] constantly entertaining guests
[1:52:04] constantly doing all those kind of
[1:52:06] things it's a calling but it's willing
[1:52:08] you but it's worth spending your life
[1:52:11] for whatever God has called you to do or
[1:52:13] called you to be it's you have to ask
[1:52:15] yourself the question is this the cause
[1:52:18] I'm willing to spend my life for I'm not
[1:52:22] willing to spend my life I'll just say a
[1:52:24] few things for video games I'm not
[1:52:27] willing to spend my life for internet
[1:52:30] I'm not even willing to spend my life
[1:52:32] for a career I had a career I was on a
[1:52:35] fast rising Fast Track in the banking
[1:52:37] industry I was in management moving qu
[1:52:40] very quickly up the ladder every year
[1:52:41] getting a promotion but when this
[1:52:43] message came by my way I counted that as
[1:52:47] more value than what that career was
[1:52:49] offering me and I left that behind for
[1:52:52] this
[1:52:53] Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ
[1:52:56] greater treasure than the riches of
[1:52:58] Egypt think about it that'd be like
[1:53:01] being the king of United States that's
[1:53:04] the greatest nation in the world having
[1:53:06] everything your Beck can call Money
[1:53:09] women anything possession that you
[1:53:11] wanted lands and and travel and
[1:53:14] everything else anything that Moses
[1:53:16] could have wanted he says I take all
[1:53:18] that on put it on one end of scale and I
[1:53:20] put the reproach of Christ on the other
[1:53:22] into the scale and the reproach of
[1:53:24] Christ outweighs everything else Hall
[1:53:28] amen that's the reality of the power and
[1:53:31] the value of the revealed word of
[1:53:35] God would you put that back up for me so
[1:53:38] it says if you endure chastening God
[1:53:41] deals with you as with sons for what son
[1:53:45] is he whom the father chasteneth
[1:53:48] not Paul's actually taking it from
[1:53:50] Proverbs chapter 3 he says says my son
[1:53:53] despise not thou the chastening of the
[1:53:55] Lord neither be weary of his correction
[1:53:57] who are the Proverbs written by largely
[1:53:59] by Solomon and so the wisest man that
[1:54:02] was known on the face of the Earth he
[1:54:03] writes these things for whom the Lord
[1:54:05] loveth he correct I want you to catch
[1:54:08] that now because we'll come back to this
[1:54:10] Solomon is writing this whom the Lord
[1:54:14] loveth he
[1:54:16] correct even as a father the son in whom
[1:54:21] he delighted
[1:54:24] amen so I want to just drop this in will
[1:54:27] a bab in Christ go up in the Rapture
[1:54:29] absolutely if he's a babe he's born
[1:54:32] again no matter how young he is he'll go
[1:54:34] up anyway so just drop that in just to
[1:54:37] balance it as we're talking about
[1:54:38] maturity maturity does not produce a
[1:54:41] Rapture maturity produces
[1:54:43] usefulness the new birth produces the
[1:54:46] Rapture all
[1:54:48] right so God dealth with you as with son
[1:54:52] I want to look at the word here Sun just
[1:54:55] for a moment and the word sun in the in
[1:54:58] the
[1:55:01] scripture uh is actually the in the
[1:55:03] Hebrew word
[1:55:05] Ben uh so that's the like you've maybe
[1:55:08] heard of David benan was one of the
[1:55:10] founding fathers of the Modern Nation of
[1:55:12] Israel and Ben meaning son is saying
[1:55:15] David's son of gurian he's identifying
[1:55:18] himself even though that wasn't his real
[1:55:19] name that was a name that he took on but
[1:55:21] he was identifying himself in connection
[1:55:23] with gurian so he he was actually saying
[1:55:27] something about himself that he was a
[1:55:30] furtherance of gurian by making that
[1:55:33] statement now we realize that we rais
[1:55:36] Sons as we raise
[1:55:38] sons that we can only take our sons so
[1:55:42] far we we try to uh train them we try to
[1:55:45] get them the best education whatever
[1:55:47] might help them in their future life but
[1:55:49] there comes a time that Sons need to be
[1:55:52] on their own they need to be uh taking
[1:55:56] control of their lives and especially
[1:55:58] allowing the Lord to take control of
[1:56:00] their lives because their Earthly
[1:56:01] parents can only take them so far it
[1:56:03] takes God to take them all the way to
[1:56:05] who they are all right and we realize
[1:56:07] that the Bible says that the word is a
[1:56:10] discerner of the thought and intents of
[1:56:13] the heart dividing a Sunder between Soul
[1:56:16] and Spirit it's a sharp two-edged sword
[1:56:19] dividing us under between Soul and
[1:56:20] Spirit what does that mean
[1:56:23] what is your soul and what is your
[1:56:24] spirit your soul is where the
[1:56:27] predestinated seed is it is who you are
[1:56:31] your spirit is what you think you are
[1:56:36] memories reasonings conscience
[1:56:37] affections your spirit is molded by your
[1:56:40] culture it's molded by your home it's
[1:56:44] molded by your education it's molded by
[1:56:47] your environment your memories your
[1:56:49] reasonings all that kind of stuff is is
[1:56:52] is a process in your life that you
[1:56:54] become what you think you're a certain
[1:56:56] something many times we have to be
[1:56:57] careful as parents what we say to our
[1:57:00] children because that will Lodge within
[1:57:02] their minds all right so as we speak
[1:57:05] something to them uh you know there's
[1:57:07] been many people that have been told for
[1:57:09] example Albert Einstein was told at a
[1:57:11] young age he'll never amount to
[1:57:13] anything he you know he he learned to to
[1:57:16] talk late in life he learned you know he
[1:57:19] was didn't do extremely well at school
[1:57:21] and it was lodged in his mind you'll
[1:57:22] never be nothing well he became one of
[1:57:24] the greatest Minds that the world ever
[1:57:25] had you see so we got to be careful what
[1:57:28] we say because that's what we the young
[1:57:30] people begin to think about themselves
[1:57:32] I'll just leave you to do that so what
[1:57:34] happens now back up for me sorry I
[1:57:36] didn't mean to Point At You what what
[1:57:38] happens is uh is that a a child grows up
[1:57:43] a certain way we all grow up a certain
[1:57:45] way even we can even go into our later
[1:57:47] years with a certain idea of who we are
[1:57:50] but the word comes comes to divide
[1:57:53] between what you think you are and what
[1:57:57] God says you
[1:57:59] are all right so the word comes and with
[1:58:03] a sharp two-edged sword and separates
[1:58:05] out all the wrong things of what we
[1:58:09] thought see brother Brandon makes it was
[1:58:12] asked a question and I have it here and
[1:58:14] he and he said
[1:58:17] um let that's a question if the case may
[1:58:20] be that the devil is placing thought
[1:58:22] thoughts in your mind about a certain
[1:58:23] thing how may it be overcome or got rid
[1:58:26] of brother Bram says take the very vice
[1:58:28] versa says if the devil makes you think
[1:58:31] that he says if you know you're a
[1:58:33] Christian and he tries to make you think
[1:58:35] you're not a Christian he says take the
[1:58:39] very vice versa I am a Christian as long
[1:58:43] as your experience matches in God's word
[1:58:45] all right that's I'm sorry I thought I
[1:58:48] had a different quote there I'll go back
[1:58:49] to the other quote and there there's
[1:58:51] another question in questions and
[1:58:52] answers brother Bram has asked how can I
[1:58:54] tell the difference between my thoughts
[1:58:57] and the devil's
[1:58:58] thoughts you ever wondered
[1:59:01] that well a few honest
[1:59:04] people brother Bron makes a statement he
[1:59:07] says if it's the devil's thoughts or
[1:59:10] rather if it's contrary to the word it's
[1:59:12] the devil's
[1:59:14] thoughts if it agrees with the word it's
[1:59:17] God's
[1:59:19] thoughts period and of
[1:59:22] discussion or brother Tim where is my
[1:59:26] thoughts brother Brown said the devil's
[1:59:28] thoughts and God's thoughts that's all
[1:59:31] you have in your
[1:59:33] mind you have either the devil's
[1:59:35] thoughts or God's thought oh brother Tim
[1:59:37] don't I think yeah as a man thinketh in
[1:59:39] his heart so is he not in his mind well
[1:59:44] then what is the mind for he will tell
[1:59:46] you that the mind is is a generator of
[1:59:49] original thoughts but actually the Mind
[1:59:51] does not generate a single thought the
[1:59:54] Mind receives thoughts receives re
[1:59:57] thoughts thoughts either from the devil
[1:59:59] or from God and what you are you are a
[2:00:03] free moral agent in your soul you have
[2:00:06] to decide what thoughts you accept and
[2:00:09] what thoughts you
[2:00:11] reject you see that's why the greatest
[2:00:13] battle ever fought is in the mind and so
[2:00:17] you've got to get the holy spirit in
[2:00:19] your soul the word in your soul that
[2:00:21] will on the battleground of your mind
[2:00:23] see that's why many times we don't
[2:00:25] understand how can I leave the service
[2:00:27] and not remember everything that was
[2:00:29] said I enjoyed so much of the service
[2:00:31] and then I leave and I forget half of it
[2:00:33] why do I do that that's because in your
[2:00:35] soul there's no
[2:00:37] memory that's in your mind see you're
[2:00:40] not to receive the word in your mind
[2:00:42] you're to receive it in your soul by
[2:00:44] faith and then when God has need of it
[2:00:47] he brings it back to your remembrance
[2:00:51] brings it out on the Battleground to
[2:00:53] combat the enemy and so we realize now
[2:00:56] brother Tim why are you going into all
[2:00:58] those things because once you're born
[2:00:59] again it's having your
[2:01:01] senses exercised to discern both good
[2:01:05] and evil see it's a training ground of
[2:01:07] how to deal with the devil and and how
[2:01:10] to receive God in your mind if you can
[2:01:13] operate in that real in your spirit real
[2:01:15] because you're sealed already to the day
[2:01:17] of your Redemption but it's in your
[2:01:19] spirit that we operate because we're a
[2:01:21] human being
[2:01:22] we have a human spirit and we have to
[2:01:25] operate the word of God because the soul
[2:01:27] controls the spirit the spirit controls
[2:01:30] the
[2:01:30] body but if the same spirit that Jesus
[2:01:34] that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in
[2:01:37] you in your heart it shall Quicken your
[2:01:41] mortal body amen what bring it subject
[2:01:45] to the word of
[2:01:46] God
[2:01:48] Amen now what is a son
[2:01:53] go
[2:01:54] ahead it's a builder of the family
[2:01:58] name so now you as a
[2:02:01] son if God calls you his son you're not
[2:02:04] building your own
[2:02:06] name you're building the family name
[2:02:09] what is the family name
[2:02:12] Jehovah what is the family name
[2:02:15] Jesus the name the Jehovah of the Old
[2:02:18] Testament is Jesus of the new Jesus said
[2:02:21] I came in my father's name amen he said
[2:02:26] he prayed he said Lord I have or father
[2:02:28] I have declared unto them thy name he
[2:02:33] didn't say my name he said thy name amen
[2:02:37] uh sanctify them through the truth Thy
[2:02:40] word is truth many things like that give
[2:02:42] me the the next one what is the
[2:02:45] name what exactly does a name mean
[2:02:47] you've got a
[2:02:49] name I've got a name
[2:02:53] and we're all we're sons and we we have
[2:02:56] this process that God is taking us
[2:02:58] through and and
[2:03:04] uh and we've got we're called Sons
[2:03:07] because of a certain aspect and I I'm
[2:03:09] just going to stop there just for a
[2:03:10] moment and go back to the thought of
[2:03:12] sons I say I just left something out
[2:03:14] here it's good to have notes sometimes
[2:03:16] because you might leave a key out here
[2:03:18] for understanding but the term son
[2:03:22] is L like the term the children of
[2:03:24] Israel literally means the son of Israel
[2:03:27] all right belshazzar in the Bible is
[2:03:29] called the son of Nebuchadnezzar even
[2:03:31] though he's actually his
[2:03:32] grandson all right so I want you to
[2:03:35] catch in the Hebrew son means something
[2:03:38] more than just an
[2:03:40] offspring all right it doesn't just mean
[2:03:42] this man impregnated a woman she had a
[2:03:45] child it was a boy that's his son no it
[2:03:47] means much much more than that all right
[2:03:50] they are those that take on and build
[2:03:53] the family name they are Sons that's why
[2:03:56] God does not have grandsons that's right
[2:04:00] amen he only has sons all right those In
[2:04:05] Those whom he receiveth or those he
[2:04:08] claims as his own son so it's it's
[2:04:12] literally meaning that the the life the
[2:04:15] sons of God means that the life came
[2:04:17] from God and the image of God is passed
[2:04:21] onto that son Genesis 1 says God created
[2:04:25] man in his own
[2:04:27] image at Genesis 5 says Adam lived in
[2:04:31] 130 years and begat a son in his own
[2:04:34] likeness in his own image Genesis 9 says
[2:04:37] when a who so sheds a man's blood by man
[2:04:40] shall his blood be shed for in the image
[2:04:42] of God made he man all right so men and
[2:04:49] women lost the original life
[2:04:52] you still with me I know you're
[2:04:54] listening closely we came out from the
[2:04:56] Garden of Eden we were born in sin
[2:04:59] shaped in iniquity we come into the
[2:05:01] world speaking lies but we always were
[2:05:03] the sons of God all right we did not
[2:05:06] become the sons I'll get to that in a
[2:05:08] moment but we always were but then the
[2:05:11] Bible says in John 1 as many as received
[2:05:14] him to them gave he power to become the
[2:05:18] sons of God it doesn't make you Sons it
[2:05:22] give empowers you to be what you were
[2:05:25] always meant to
[2:05:27] be all right to them that believe on his
[2:05:30] name which are born not of blood nor of
[2:05:32] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[2:05:34] man but of God all right so it's a
[2:05:38] builder of the family
[2:05:40] name the name is a Mark or Memorial of
[2:05:44] individuality this is an important
[2:05:46] foundation because it a name
[2:05:50] represents a specific something that is
[2:05:54] identified with that name it represents
[2:05:58] honor it represents Authority it
[2:06:01] represents character of the individual
[2:06:04] give me the next line all right it's the
[2:06:07] it's only the thought expressed that
[2:06:11] declares the character of the individual
[2:06:14] it's not the thought that declares the
[2:06:17] character it's the thought expressed
[2:06:20] that declares the character
[2:06:22] all right what I'm saying here is going
[2:06:24] back to the Garden of
[2:06:25] Eden people often people that are not
[2:06:28] willing to acknowledge the original sin
[2:06:30] they try and place it somewhere well it
[2:06:32] was Disobedience that caused Adam and
[2:06:35] Eve to be cast out of the Garden of Eden
[2:06:37] that's true but what was the
[2:06:40] Disobedience how did that Disobedience
[2:06:42] become expressed see there had to be an
[2:06:45] action so is it in character character
[2:06:49] is based on your action and in
[2:06:51] particular I Zer in on your
[2:06:54] decisions because it's the nature on the
[2:06:57] inside that causes the decisions in the
[2:07:00] mind if the nature is unbelief then the
[2:07:03] Mind makes the wrong
[2:07:06] decisions but if the nature is Faith
[2:07:09] then that can come on the Battleground
[2:07:12] exercise your life to discern between
[2:07:14] what is right and what is wrong train
[2:07:16] you to make the right decisions because
[2:07:20] like Adam you're were free IMM moral
[2:07:22] agent praise be to God all right now
[2:07:26] your name means something but God's name
[2:07:30] is
[2:07:33] eternal in genes or in Exodus chapter 3
[2:07:36] Moses says to God he
[2:07:38] says when I am come unto the children of
[2:07:41] Israel and shall say to them the god of
[2:07:45] your fathers has sent me unto you and
[2:07:47] they shall say to me what is his name
[2:07:52] he says what shall I say unto them now
[2:07:55] he didn't know him as
[2:07:56] Jehovah all right so God had not yet
[2:07:59] revealed himself in that way but so God
[2:08:02] says to Moses I am that I
[2:08:05] am and he said thus Thou shalt say unto
[2:08:08] the children of Israel I am has sent me
[2:08:11] the present God I want you to go tell
[2:08:14] them the god that is on the scene the
[2:08:18] god that is present with you not a god
[2:08:21] of yesterday I don't want you to look at
[2:08:23] me as the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[2:08:25] anymore amen I want you to look at me as
[2:08:28] your
[2:08:29] God I don't want you to look at me as
[2:08:31] the god of William brandham
[2:08:33] anymore I want you to look at me as your
[2:08:36] God he's the I am he's the present one
[2:08:40] that is present to fulfill his word
[2:08:43] neither is he the I will
[2:08:45] be looking forward to something as
[2:08:47] though the Rapture is something a far
[2:08:49] off the Rapture isn't something a far
[2:08:51] off the Rapture is his
[2:08:54] bride the bride is the rapture in in
[2:08:58] flesh and the process she is going
[2:09:00] through is called a Rapture shout voice
[2:09:04] and trumpet firstly a message to gather
[2:09:06] the people together is that right and so
[2:09:09] we see that there's a process that God
[2:09:11] has put us in he's the I am and then in
[2:09:14] Exodus chapter 20 he says says to Israel
[2:09:17] I am the Lord thy God that Lord is
[2:09:20] Jehovah JV huu or uh some people say YH
[2:09:24] wh and that's where they get the word
[2:09:26] Yahweh from and they they have all kinds
[2:09:28] of different iterations that they want
[2:09:30] to give to the name that's not relevant
[2:09:32] he's making himself known by the name
[2:09:34] Jehovah and he says which have brought
[2:09:36] thee out of the land of Egypt out of the
[2:09:38] house of bondage he says Thou shalt have
[2:09:41] no other gods before me and then he then
[2:09:43] we jump down he says Thou shalt not take
[2:09:46] the name of the Lord thy God in vain
[2:09:51] now we always know that as swearing but
[2:09:54] it's much more than that it's actually
[2:09:57] don't call yourself by my name if you're
[2:10:01] not of
[2:10:02] me amen don't take my name in vain for I
[2:10:06] will not hold him Guiltless who takes my
[2:10:08] name in vain he or she who calls
[2:10:12] themselves a Christian you can only call
[2:10:14] yourself a Christian by surrendering
[2:10:16] yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:10:19] saying I am God's it's 100% Christianity
[2:10:23] there's no such thing as 99%
[2:10:26] Christianity amen it's a complete
[2:10:29] surrender and a complete separation from
[2:10:32] all
[2:10:33] unbelief amen what is it it's your
[2:10:36] decision and those that are able to make
[2:10:39] that decision God says those are my sons
[2:10:44] I give them my name so a son is the
[2:10:49] genes through whom God is EST abl
[2:10:51] lishing his name or identity in Genesis
[2:10:56] chapter 2 brother Bram says he he said I
[2:10:58] am uh yah yahu Jehovah what did it mean
[2:11:04] I am the all- existent one who created
[2:11:06] something off of myself to be a son of
[2:11:09] mine or a temporary or a little amateur
[2:11:11] one of mine oh I got to read that again
[2:11:14] he says I I am the Alle existent one who
[2:11:17] created something off of myself to be a
[2:11:21] son of mine or a temporary or an amateur
[2:11:25] little one of mine amen so who are we we
[2:11:29] are created off of God for a purpose
[2:11:33] Amen to be an amateur little God to be
[2:11:37] an amateur Jehovah and then he says
[2:11:40] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[2:11:43] amateur God because he is Father God and
[2:11:47] he made man an amateur God so he isn't
[2:11:51] self-existent anymore he exists with his
[2:11:56] family this is a key key thought in the
[2:11:59] scripture that we have to understand who
[2:12:02] we are in this life because you know
[2:12:04] Elijah called Israel up to Mount Carmel
[2:12:07] and he makes this makes the statement
[2:12:10] and he says if ba if Jehovah be God then
[2:12:13] serve him if Baal be God then serve him
[2:12:17] what is he saying there he's he's
[2:12:19] pronouncing something there to Israel
[2:12:20] you need to make a
[2:12:22] decision what name are you identified in
[2:12:27] because in the Hebrew he's actually
[2:12:28] saying if Jehovah be Elohim serve him
[2:12:33] but if Baal be Elohim serve him so the
[2:12:37] question is not is there an Elohim which
[2:12:39] is the self-existing
[2:12:41] god but the question is what is the name
[2:12:45] of that God Amen and that name has must
[2:12:49] be what you are identified in in his
[2:12:53] name cuz brother bradam said give me the
[2:12:55] next qu slide
[2:12:57] please next
[2:12:59] one Jehovah means the one who exists
[2:13:03] with his
[2:13:06] family now catch that statement he was
[2:13:10] Elohim back before there was anything he
[2:13:12] was Elohim the self-existing God but in
[2:13:16] his thoughts he was Jehovah but to be
[2:13:19] Jehovah meant he had a
[2:13:22] family in other words he can't be
[2:13:24] Jehovah without
[2:13:28] you it's not just we're adding oursel he
[2:13:31] is only Jehovah because he has
[2:13:33] manifested
[2:13:35] you before that he's only Elohim but he
[2:13:38] had a desire to express the thoughts
[2:13:41] that was in his mind because by doing
[2:13:44] that that makes him
[2:13:47] Jehovah Hallelujah so we are the very
[2:13:51] expression of his name that's why a son
[2:13:54] means a builder of the family name
[2:13:58] Hallelujah so because we are here we are
[2:14:03] expressing his
[2:14:05] name we
[2:14:08] are the expression of
[2:14:13] Jehovah you are the expression of
[2:14:17] Jehovah that's why we say it's the word
[2:14:20] made flesh today
[2:14:22] what is it it's Jehovah expressing
[2:14:24] himself in his
[2:14:26] family Jesus making himself known in his
[2:14:28] bride it's the same expression it's the
[2:14:31] name declared that's why you know people
[2:14:33] that aren't willing to take on that name
[2:14:35] in baptism I don't understand it I am
[2:14:37] that name
[2:14:39] expressed I am not a title expressed I
[2:14:41] am not a father I am not a son I'm not a
[2:14:44] holy spirit but I am a Jesus
[2:14:48] expressed Jesus attribute manifested in
[2:14:52] flesh all right let me go to the church
[2:14:55] age book here you still with
[2:14:58] me can I go a little further all right I
[2:15:02] was a little
[2:15:06] quieter all right so he goes says down
[2:15:08] through the centuries we could go we
[2:15:10] find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist
[2:15:13] and each one of these were God's Eternal
[2:15:16] thought expressed in its
[2:15:19] season then we come to Jesus the
[2:15:23] logos he was perfect the perfect and
[2:15:27] complete thought expressed and he became
[2:15:30] known as the word that is what he is and
[2:15:34] forever will be see Jesus is not
[2:15:38] something that is separate or or not is
[2:15:40] something that is just another attribute
[2:15:42] he's the fullness of the attributes he's
[2:15:44] all of God dwelling in flesh before I go
[2:15:47] on there I want to just read a a
[2:15:49] statement here brother Bram makes in
[2:15:51] total Deliverance he says Jesus was
[2:15:53] completely totally man he could cry like
[2:15:56] a man he could eat like a man he could
[2:15:57] become like a man he was completely
[2:15:59] totally man in his physical being and in
[2:16:02] his Spirit he was completely totally
[2:16:05] God so he made his flesh submissive to
[2:16:08] the spirit that was in him you see he
[2:16:10] was tempted in all manner like as we are
[2:16:12] he was a man not an angel he was a man
[2:16:15] he had desires and temptations like we
[2:16:17] do doesn't the bible say that he was
[2:16:19] tempted in all manner like as we are
[2:16:21] except without sin we're tempted and we
[2:16:24] fall but he was tempted and he never
[2:16:26] fell and so brother brandom goes on he
[2:16:29] said the Holy Ghost was in him without
[2:16:31] measure but the holy spirit is in us
[2:16:33] with measure or by measure we have a
[2:16:36] portion of the Holy Ghost he had the
[2:16:37] fullness of the Holy Ghost that's why he
[2:16:39] had to go to Calvary that the life that
[2:16:41] was in him the Life In The Blood could
[2:16:44] be loosed upon the church the feminist
[2:16:47] part could come into manifestation the
[2:16:49] church could be taken out of Christ like
[2:16:51] Eve was taken out of Adam so that she
[2:16:54] Adam could say she's Flesh of My Flesh
[2:16:56] bone of my bone but Christ could say he
[2:16:58] we're flesh of his flesh bone of his
[2:17:00] bone life of his life amen we're his
[2:17:03] very expression all right so in him was
[2:17:06] the Holy Ghost without measure and he
[2:17:07] was completely God he proved it when he
[2:17:09] raised the Dead when he stopped nature
[2:17:11] the Roaring Seas the mighty winds when
[2:17:13] he spoke to the trees so forth they
[2:17:15] obeyed him he was God on the inside he
[2:17:18] could have been man for he was man but
[2:17:21] he totally and completely delivered
[2:17:23] himself as a man into the hands of God
[2:17:26] for the service of God and he is our
[2:17:32] example we are men and women we're also
[2:17:36] Christians if he's our example let us
[2:17:38] completely deliver ourselves into the
[2:17:41] hands of the Holy Ghost that we might be
[2:17:44] subjects of the kingdom of God Amen all
[2:17:48] right so he's the full expression of the
[2:17:51] thought but Moses Jeremiah John the
[2:17:53] Baptist they were also expressions of
[2:17:55] God's thoughts God's thoughts are
[2:17:57] Eternal he never thought a new thought
[2:17:59] but he expresses those thoughts in their
[2:18:01] season in very plain language he says
[2:18:04] the true bride of Christ was in the mind
[2:18:06] of God eternally though not expressed
[2:18:10] until each came forth in the designated
[2:18:13] decreed
[2:18:15] season and each member that's you and me
[2:18:19] that's came forth as each member came
[2:18:22] forth it became expressed and took its
[2:18:27] place in the body so why did you come
[2:18:31] forth to take your place in the body
[2:18:34] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[2:18:38] word seed bride what is it we are his
[2:18:43] word that was spoken for this age that's
[2:18:45] why we couldn't receive another message
[2:18:48] when this message was spoken the Deep
[2:18:50] was responding to the Deep call that's
[2:18:53] in you and only you could receive this
[2:18:56] message amen it's not for everybody give
[2:18:59] it to a million people you might find
[2:19:01] one why because it was only sent for
[2:19:03] that one and that's why God doesn't do a
[2:19:06] mass mail out program of the message God
[2:19:09] knows who that one is he doesn't need to
[2:19:12] introduce the message to the other
[2:19:16] 999,999 he's looking for that one in a
[2:19:19] million amen amen right now then here we
[2:19:23] are coming to a conclusion pay close
[2:19:25] attention here as the Eternal logos was
[2:19:29] manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[2:19:34] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:19:37] and that Eternal one was the father
[2:19:41] manifested in flesh is that right and
[2:19:46] thereby or by being the father
[2:19:48] manifested in flesh he G gain the title
[2:19:51] of son so how was Jesus a son because he
[2:19:56] was the father manifested in flesh
[2:20:01] amen even so
[2:20:04] we let me stop on that statement even so
[2:20:08] we that means the same as Jesus so are
[2:20:12] we we're not the fullness but we're a
[2:20:16] portion we are Sons and Daughters of God
[2:20:19] even so we Eternal in his thoughts in
[2:20:23] our turn became the many membered spoken
[2:20:27] word seed manifested in
[2:20:31] flesh Hallelujah as Jesus was was the
[2:20:36] word manifested in flesh gaining the
[2:20:38] title of son we are the word manifested
[2:20:42] in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[2:20:45] manifested in flesh are the sons of God
[2:20:51] even as we are so called the only way
[2:20:54] you could be a Son of God it applies to
[2:20:57] brothers and sisters only way you can be
[2:20:59] a Son of God is to be his thoughts in
[2:21:04] flesh and his thoughts are
[2:21:07] substance his thoughts are him his
[2:21:11] thoughts are
[2:21:12] Jehovah the name is an expression of the
[2:21:15] thoughts and the character of the one
[2:21:18] whose thoughts they are and though those
[2:21:20] thoughts or that name manifested in
[2:21:23] flesh that makes us the sons of
[2:21:27] God there's no other way for you to be a
[2:21:29] Son of God you can't be a Son of God
[2:21:32] just say well it's just a nice
[2:21:33] expression in the scripture No we
[2:21:35] literally are Jehovah manifested in
[2:21:40] flesh we literally were in his mind
[2:21:42] before the foundation of the world but
[2:21:45] we had to wait for our season but this
[2:21:47] is our season this is our time
[2:21:51] I'm Not Looking Back to Pentecost or
[2:21:53] Wesley or Luther or back in the Dark
[2:21:55] Ages or even back to Paul's age that was
[2:21:58] their time they were the expression of
[2:22:00] God's thoughts but now I and you are the
[2:22:02] expression of God's thoughts in this
[2:22:07] day
[2:22:10] Hallelujah those Eternal thoughts which
[2:22:13] was Jehovah thoughts which was love
[2:22:16] thoughts now manifested in flesh
[2:22:21] we are the sons of God even as we are
[2:22:24] socalled we did not become seed by the
[2:22:27] rebirth we were
[2:22:29] seed and therefore we're reborn for only
[2:22:34] the elect can be
[2:22:36] reborn because we were seed is the
[2:22:40] reason we could be
[2:22:42] quickened in non seed there is nothing
[2:22:46] to
[2:22:47] Quicken that's why when you find even as
[2:22:50] a young person or someone struggling
[2:22:52] with their faith even as you find you
[2:22:55] pick up the word and you find the word
[2:22:57] dealing with you why is that there's
[2:22:59] something in you to deal
[2:23:01] with there's something on the inside of
[2:23:03] the inside that's wanting you as a free
[2:23:05] moral agent to surrender to that word
[2:23:08] you have to make a thought you have to
[2:23:10] make a choice as you receive this
[2:23:12] thought in your mind and it begins to
[2:23:14] burn down in your heart that's why they
[2:23:16] walked on the road to EMAs and said did
[2:23:17] not our hearts burn within us as he
[2:23:20] spoke to us along the way why because
[2:23:23] their attitude towards the word was all
[2:23:25] mixed mixed up they were in the total
[2:23:27] wrong thinking of what was happening all
[2:23:29] around them see the word was being
[2:23:31] declared and manifested the scripture
[2:23:33] was being fulfilled they were looking at
[2:23:35] it with their eyes but because they were
[2:23:38] looking at it in the wrong mental
[2:23:39] capacity by a false teaching they
[2:23:42] couldn't see what was taking place but
[2:23:45] now the word come by their way and he
[2:23:47] begin to share with them beginning at
[2:23:49] Moses and all the prophets the
[2:23:51] scriptures pertaining to them himself
[2:23:54] begin to make those events clear by what
[2:23:56] had already been spoken in the word now
[2:23:59] their attitude begin to be adjusted and
[2:24:02] their eyes become
[2:24:04] open they begin to see oh this is him
[2:24:07] sitting right in front of us he
[2:24:08] disappears out of their midst why their
[2:24:11] attitude by revelation of the word had
[2:24:13] to be
[2:24:14] changed Glory that's why we're still
[2:24:17] here Saints God is still changing our
[2:24:19] attitude
[2:24:20] he's washing us of our spiritual Amnesia
[2:24:23] he's separating us from all unbelief
[2:24:26] he's washing Us in the water of the word
[2:24:29] why that he might present himself a
[2:24:31] bride not having spot or wrinkle or
[2:24:34] blemish or any such thing
[2:24:38] Hallelujah that's his people that's his
[2:24:41] attributes he saw us before the
[2:24:43] foundation of the world rejoicing in
[2:24:46] this Revelation shouting for Joy Brother
[2:24:49] Andy said we ought to shout for Joy they
[2:24:52] want to declare oh God I'm your
[2:24:54] attribute oh Lord I'm Yours your word is
[2:24:57] Quicken me it has made me alive it has
[2:25:00] brought me to the revelation of who I am
[2:25:03] praise be to
[2:25:05] God it brought me the Revelation that
[2:25:07] God could heal
[2:25:09] me that God could supernaturally direct
[2:25:11] my path brother Tony was sharing with me
[2:25:13] his testimony how God had to
[2:25:15] supernaturally bring a series of events
[2:25:18] so he could understand you're sick
[2:25:20] and you need help and then God comes on
[2:25:23] the scene but if he's just you know a
[2:25:26] lot of us men are stubborn not you
[2:25:28] brother Tony but us men
[2:25:31] and you Brave sitting on the front
[2:25:35] there you know we're we're just starting
[2:25:38] I'll tough it out I'll be all right in a
[2:25:40] little while we get weaker we get weaker
[2:25:43] brother BR says in one place and I don't
[2:25:45] mean to send everybody to the doctor he
[2:25:46] says in one place if you're sick go to
[2:25:48] the doctor and find out what it is
[2:25:50] he didn't say rely on the doctor you
[2:25:52] know it's amazing to me sometimes people
[2:25:54] get sick we get so relying on medical
[2:25:56] attention don't
[2:25:57] we come on we do it's so easy that's why
[2:26:02] and there's nothing wrong with medical
[2:26:03] attention I just went to the doctor
[2:26:05] myself not too long ago and and and
[2:26:07] that's perfectly all right the doctors
[2:26:09] are trained in how these bodies
[2:26:12] operate but you know brother Bram also
[2:26:14] said God heals by
[2:26:16] music but we never make an appointment
[2:26:19] with a musician
[2:26:26] all right all you musicians are going to
[2:26:27] be busy
[2:26:29] now brother I need a half an hour of
[2:26:32] music
[2:26:34] please I want you to you know God heals
[2:26:36] by
[2:26:37] love praise the Lord when you go home
[2:26:40] husband wife you're not feeling well you
[2:26:42] know you your brothers are not feeling
[2:26:44] well you go home and say wife I need
[2:26:45] some
[2:26:47] loving well that got quiet that
[2:26:51] praise the Lord God heals by his word
[2:26:54] God heals by Revelation it's all his
[2:26:57] power that heals it's only God that
[2:26:59] heals I am the god that heals all thy
[2:27:02] sicknesses and diseases and if it takes
[2:27:04] a doctor to give you something to kill
[2:27:06] what's in you so be it it takes a doctor
[2:27:08] to sew it up cut it up cut it out put it
[2:27:11] in put it out whatever they do you know
[2:27:13] so be it that's perfectly all right but
[2:27:16] God's the only one that can heal you he
[2:27:18] is our healer amen he is our provider
[2:27:21] what is that that's his
[2:27:23] expression he couldn't show himself to
[2:27:26] you that Jehovah Is A Healer unless you
[2:27:28] got
[2:27:29] sick but he allowed you to get sick so
[2:27:32] he can show you I'm your
[2:27:34] healer he put it in his word I'm your
[2:27:36] healer forget not all his benefits the
[2:27:39] Lord Jehovah who forgives all your sins
[2:27:43] who heals all your sicknesses and
[2:27:46] diseases amen
[2:27:50] thank you I think that's the end of
[2:27:53] that so
[2:27:55] now there's a there's a attribute
[2:27:59] response to the word oh my let me go
[2:28:02] just a little bit further will you
[2:28:03] you're not too hot are you all right
[2:28:07] it's actually cooler in the morning than
[2:28:08] it is in the evening so brother Al's
[2:28:11] preaching tonight so you're you're not
[2:28:13] going to do very well brother Al I'm
[2:28:15] going to take up all the cool air in
[2:28:16] this
[2:28:19] place you'll do fine the Lord will be
[2:28:21] with you amen looking forward to
[2:28:23] tonight's service
[2:28:25] too now Jesus was God's only begotten
[2:28:30] son but he wasn't God's only
[2:28:33] attribute he was the total sum of all of
[2:28:36] God's attribute or God's name was in him
[2:28:39] as Jesus said I come in my father's name
[2:28:41] I've manifested thy name I've declared
[2:28:44] thy name but he wasn't the only one I
[2:28:47] want you to take your Bibles we'll just
[2:28:49] look at it at one scripture
[2:28:54] here Mark chapter
[2:29:05] 10 I don't know today's Sunday right I I
[2:29:09] have to ask you because it's actually
[2:29:11] the day before at home it's actually
[2:29:13] Saturday and uh it's 3 hours later but
[2:29:16] it's the previous day and so I'm always
[2:29:18] back and forth between the two places
[2:29:19] it's Saturday there but it's Sunday here
[2:29:21] there's a camp going on there as there's
[2:29:22] a camp going on here so they're having a
[2:29:24] Saturday service while we're having a
[2:29:26] Sunday
[2:29:29] service it's a little confusing for
[2:29:31] me in Mark chapter 10 we find the the
[2:29:35] story of the Rich Young Ruler verse
[2:29:38] 17 and it says and when he had gone
[2:29:41] forth in the way there came one running
[2:29:43] and KN to him saying good Master what
[2:29:45] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[2:29:47] life and Jesus said to him why call
[2:29:50] callest thou me good there is none good
[2:29:51] but one and that is God thou knowest the
[2:29:54] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[2:29:56] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[2:29:58] witness defraud not honor thy father and
[2:30:00] mother let's stop there for a moment it
[2:30:03] really struck me one day as Jesus is
[2:30:05] dealing with this young
[2:30:06] man that he never said you know the
[2:30:11] greatest
[2:30:12] commandment he never told him the
[2:30:14] greatest commandment is to love the Lord
[2:30:17] thy God with all thy heart all thy Soul
[2:30:19] all thy mind
[2:30:20] and all thy
[2:30:22] strength why didn't he why didn't he
[2:30:24] name that because he's not dealing with
[2:30:27] a predestinated seed
[2:30:29] here he's dealing with somebody that's
[2:30:32] not predestinated to love
[2:30:34] God but he named things that he could
[2:30:37] say I've done these things all right and
[2:30:41] he answered and said master all of these
[2:30:43] things I've observe from my youth now
[2:30:45] notice verse 21 Jesus beholding him
[2:30:48] loved him and said unto him one thing
[2:30:51] thou lackest go sell thy go thy way sell
[2:30:54] whatsoever thou Hast give to the poor
[2:30:56] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[2:30:58] come and take up thy cross and follow me
[2:31:01] and he was sad at that saying that
[2:31:02] saying and went away grieved for he had
[2:31:05] great possessions all right now I have
[2:31:08] to actually take you to another
[2:31:09] scripture and that is John chapter 15
[2:31:12] I'm sorry I said one scripture but we'll
[2:31:15] actually take
[2:31:17] two because
[2:31:20] we don't understand what love
[2:31:22] is and Jesus beholding him loved
[2:31:26] him but actually in the Bible there's
[2:31:28] two forms of love and there's felo and
[2:31:31] agapo love or agape love uh and so now
[2:31:37] here Jesus is looking at this young man
[2:31:39] but he's actually expressing agapo love
[2:31:43] but fio love is just a human love that
[2:31:45] is expressed and I used to think well
[2:31:47] this man is when Jesus loved it must
[2:31:50] have been fial love because he's not an
[2:31:52] attribute of God and so how could God
[2:31:54] Express a goppel love to somebody that's
[2:31:56] not his attribute well he does do that
[2:31:59] sometimes in order to check the response
[2:32:02] because it's the expression of love that
[2:32:04] God loves you we love him because he
[2:32:07] first loved us and so when God expresses
[2:32:10] his love to us it's our love back to him
[2:32:14] that shows that we are the attributes of
[2:32:16] God all right now let me just let me
[2:32:19] just explain this a little bit for you
[2:32:20] as we go into it because Divine love is
[2:32:23] a very very rich subject listen we have
[2:32:25] come to the Capstone
[2:32:27] hour the Capstone is what divine love
[2:32:31] that's right that's been revealed in
[2:32:33] this hour with
[2:32:42] cryingsad the result all right that's
[2:32:45] already been recorded but the full
[2:32:47] expression of love only comes in in this
[2:32:50] hour as God says to his bride in Ezekiel
[2:32:53] 16 he says the time of love amen so when
[2:32:57] we come to bride time maturity time it
[2:33:01] is the time of love what they knew of
[2:33:05] Love down Through the Ages is not the
[2:33:08] fullness of what God has expressed in
[2:33:10] this hour all right so let's look at it
[2:33:13] here in John chapter 15 because there's
[2:33:15] actually three forms or three aspects of
[2:33:18] divine love the Divine love we know in
[2:33:20] the Bible is actually the word God's
[2:33:22] love is the word
[2:33:23] agape and there's three forms agape
[2:33:26] agapo and agapetos all right there's
[2:33:29] your Greek lesson for the day and Agape
[2:33:32] is the noun it's love as it
[2:33:35] exists God is love God is agape but
[2:33:40] agapo is a verb which means an action so
[2:33:44] agapo is love when it is
[2:33:48] projected when Divine love is projected
[2:33:52] not when Divine love
[2:33:55] exists all right so let's go back to the
[2:33:58] thoughts of God God is love so when he
[2:34:01] was Elohim he was
[2:34:04] love but God projected the
[2:34:08] logos When Love is
[2:34:10] projected then Sovereign Grace comes on
[2:34:13] the scene and produces the result so
[2:34:15] When Love Was projected a universe come
[2:34:17] into existence Angels come come into
[2:34:20] existence Dimensions come into existence
[2:34:22] an earth comes into existence a creation
[2:34:25] comes into existence human beings come
[2:34:28] into existence the sons of God begin to
[2:34:31] manifest on the face of the Earth what
[2:34:33] is that God's love
[2:34:36] projected as long as he was just love
[2:34:39] nothing was
[2:34:41] happening all right you'll see this a
[2:34:42] little bit more as we read this the last
[2:34:45] one is agapetos which is the adjective
[2:34:48] and if we have time we'll get to that
[2:34:51] so here Jesus uses this
[2:34:54] expression verse 8 of chapter 15 of John
[2:34:57] herein is my father glorified that you
[2:35:00] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[2:35:04] disciples as the father hath loved agapo
[2:35:08] me not Agape agapo as the father
[2:35:12] projected love to me so have I agop you
[2:35:16] or projected love to you continue ye in
[2:35:19] my Agape or love that it exists dwell in
[2:35:24] the love father projected love to me I
[2:35:28] projected love to you now you dwell in
[2:35:31] that love all right but he doesn't stop
[2:35:33] there he says if you keep my
[2:35:35] Commandments you shall abide in my Agape
[2:35:40] even as I have kept my father's
[2:35:43] commandment and abide in his Agape so I
[2:35:46] abide in love the father abides in love
[2:35:49] you're to to abide in love each one of
[2:35:51] us are to have love as a substance that
[2:35:54] is the Holy Ghost all right so but he
[2:35:57] says you're not just a haveit these
[2:35:59] things have I spoken unto you that your
[2:36:03] joy that my joy might remain in you and
[2:36:06] that your joy might be full this is my
[2:36:08] commandment now that you agle one
[2:36:13] another ah now that takes on a different
[2:36:16] perspective for us as Believers it's not
[2:36:18] just to say I have love for my brother
[2:36:20] and sisters no he's saying you need to
[2:36:22] project love to your brothers and
[2:36:25] sisters you need to create an atmosphere
[2:36:29] you need to be the one that changes the
[2:36:31] situation by projecting love when God
[2:36:35] projected love a universe or creative
[2:36:38] power love is the creative power of God
[2:36:42] see and you were meant to be amateur
[2:36:45] creators and God has called you to
[2:36:47] create an atmosphere I don't have time
[2:36:50] to go into that that's a whole sermon
[2:36:52] within itself and I got the notes right
[2:36:54] here but if we would learn of what it
[2:36:56] means to create an atmosphere the
[2:36:58] greatest power that we have is not
[2:37:00] argument
[2:37:02] yes it's it's not debate it's not
[2:37:05] theology it's not knowing the quotes
[2:37:07] it's creating an
[2:37:08] atmosphere see that's why the devil as I
[2:37:11] said earlier I think yesterday that the
[2:37:13] devil battles us in our mind because we
[2:37:15] got Divine love here the greatest power
[2:37:18] that there is but he wants to clog up
[2:37:20] this because this can only be projected
[2:37:23] through that and so when you project
[2:37:26] that by bringing your thoughts in
[2:37:28] subjection to the word of God then love
[2:37:30] can create an atmosphere round about you
[2:37:32] I guess here I am because atmosphere is
[2:37:34] actually created by the things that you
[2:37:37] think
[2:37:39] on not what's in your heart by the
[2:37:41] things that you think of and so as you
[2:37:44] bring your thoughts subject to the word
[2:37:46] of God by the power of God that's in you
[2:37:48] that loses the chck chel for which
[2:37:50] Divine love to be
[2:37:57] projected this is my commandment that
[2:37:59] you project love one to another as I
[2:38:02] have projected Love to
[2:38:04] You Greater Love Agape has no man than
[2:38:07] this that he laid down his life for his
[2:38:11] friends
[2:38:14] amen I got to go to this and I'll close
[2:38:16] with I'll close on the thought of
[2:38:17] atmosphere I just got to go to
[2:38:19] atmosphere
[2:38:21] I'll leave the other thought that I was
[2:38:23] headed to because atmosphere is the
[2:38:26] projection of divine love not any
[2:38:30] atmosphere but the right
[2:38:31] atmosphere all right as as brother
[2:38:34] Bosworth said brother Bram says you
[2:38:36] could put a hen egg under a puppy and
[2:38:37] tie it down it would hatch an egg he
[2:38:40] says the puppy would hatch out a chicken
[2:38:43] because of the environment he says and
[2:38:45] when you're a Christian you associate
[2:38:47] with Christians go with Christians be a
[2:38:49] Christian you have to have the right
[2:38:51] kind of an environment around you see as
[2:38:54] I said already when brother Bram
[2:38:56] discerned people it didn't change
[2:38:58] anything of the physical reality they
[2:39:00] were already healed but he had to change
[2:39:02] their thoughts he had to change their
[2:39:04] attitude or he had to change their
[2:39:06] thinking process brother Tim why are you
[2:39:07] dealing so much on the mind because I
[2:39:09] want to get you beyond just the new
[2:39:12] birth I want to get you in the maturity
[2:39:15] that God's looking for in a bride a
[2:39:18] people know what it is to handle the
[2:39:21] word of God and leave this place this
[2:39:23] weekend with the maturity about them
[2:39:25] knowing that they're amateur creators
[2:39:27] willing to project Divine love wherever
[2:39:29] they go on the workplace in the
[2:39:31] supermarket wherever they are knowing
[2:39:33] that that power lays right within them
[2:39:35] they are redeemed Son of God with the
[2:39:37] abstract to the title deed all the
[2:39:39] promises are yours you can project an
[2:39:42] atmosphere and watch God come into that
[2:39:44] atmosphere that's why I brought you a
[2:39:46] testimony of the wave sheath as he
[2:39:48] stepped into the pulpit and a wave of
[2:39:51] the Holy Spirit went out over the
[2:39:53] congregation and created an atmosphere
[2:39:56] of divine love that delivered the people
[2:39:58] from their sickness right there didn't
[2:40:01] even need to say a word it was the
[2:40:02] atmosphere that he had gotten himself
[2:40:05] into and brother Brandon makes an
[2:40:07] expression he says you're a little
[2:40:08] Creator yourself you've seen people that
[2:40:10] you just love to be around you don't
[2:40:12] know why just that loving type of person
[2:40:16] he says haven't you seen that you like
[2:40:18] to be around them they create an
[2:40:19] atmosphere by the life they live the way
[2:40:22] they talk their
[2:40:24] conversation then you seen those every
[2:40:26] time you shun them all the time they
[2:40:29] want to talk about something evil amen
[2:40:31] all you Brothers they got to go in the
[2:40:32] workplace you know lots of people like
[2:40:34] that they they want to talk about
[2:40:36] something evil talk about somebody
[2:40:38] there's nobody in the message like that
[2:40:40] but I mean outside of the
[2:40:41] message so oh my here they come they're
[2:40:44] going to criticize somebody ain't never
[2:40:46] been a preacher criticized right and uh
[2:40:53] he's in here now he's going to talk
[2:40:55] about this man all they're going to do
[2:40:56] is tell dirty jokes or something about
[2:40:58] women or something like that you just
[2:41:00] hate to get around them they create
[2:41:04] seemingly pretty nice people but they
[2:41:06] create an
[2:41:07] atmosphere the thing that you the things
[2:41:10] that you think on the things that you do
[2:41:13] the actions the things you talk about
[2:41:16] creates an atmosphere
[2:41:19] talk about the Lord he draws near talk
[2:41:22] about the devil he draws near the things
[2:41:26] that you talk about create an atmosphere
[2:41:28] so atmosphere is created by the Mind
[2:41:32] once your soul is sealed there's where
[2:41:34] the battle is you must know how to
[2:41:38] approach the battle by creating the
[2:41:40] right atmosphere see the devil hates the
[2:41:44] atmosphere brother Bram says God's
[2:41:46] dependent on you to project his love to
[2:41:48] The Sinner you're an amateur Creator all
[2:41:51] right now when the lunatic in Portland
[2:41:54] Oregon many of you know the story how
[2:41:56] that that lunatic came to the meeting in
[2:41:58] Portland Oregon and uh TL Osborne
[2:42:01] describes it and how that there was a
[2:42:03] giant of a man that had Broke Free from
[2:42:05] the police and the night before he had
[2:42:07] he had uh I think broken a preacher's
[2:42:09] jaw or something like that and now he
[2:42:12] come into brother Brown's meetings he
[2:42:13] comes striding right up the aisle great
[2:42:15] big giant of a man 6'8 300 lb all muscle
[2:42:19] and he comes on the platform and he
[2:42:21] begins to say vile things to God's
[2:42:23] Prophet now here's a man of God in an
[2:42:26] atmosphere all right now this man is
[2:42:29] projecting
[2:42:30] hate why from the devil and the end of
[2:42:33] the story is brother brandham said he
[2:42:35] worshiped that devil he loved what it
[2:42:38] did for him and so here he was
[2:42:40] projecting that uh to brother brandham
[2:42:43] but brother brandham now notice what
[2:42:44] brother brandham does because he taught
[2:42:46] us you see I'll take a step back and
[2:42:49] talk about the the Raging Bull that he
[2:42:51] walked across the field and as he walked
[2:42:54] across this field and he was going to to
[2:42:57] pray for somebody and he didn't realize
[2:42:59] he got into the field of a bull that had
[2:43:01] already killed a man and so he's as he's
[2:43:03] walking across the field and then all of
[2:43:05] a sudden the bull snorts and he looks
[2:43:06] over and he says oh I'm in the wrong
[2:43:08] field and he reach what is his his
[2:43:10] initial reaction is I reach for my
[2:43:12] gun and he says I left it in my truck so
[2:43:15] now he's totally
[2:43:17] helpless totally V
[2:43:20] vulnerable totally someone that's he's
[2:43:22] at the mercy of God and he thought he
[2:43:24] looks at the fence
[2:43:26] line I can't make it is a is a thoughts
[2:43:30] kill the bll or run doesn't sound like
[2:43:32] Divine love to
[2:43:34] me but Divine love is the Holy Ghost
[2:43:38] that's what was in brother bram's soul
[2:43:41] that needed to come on the
[2:43:43] Forefront and he and he said the bull
[2:43:46] started to stomp his foot and started to
[2:43:49] make a move towards him and started to
[2:43:50] charge him and he said I guess this is
[2:43:53] my time I'll just face it like a man
[2:43:56] Lord help me to do that I'd probably
[2:43:58] turn and run but you know he just turns
[2:44:00] to face the bowling thought I'm going to
[2:44:02] go this is it my game's over I'm ready
[2:44:04] to die anyway and and he the bull comes
[2:44:07] towards him he says all of a sudden an
[2:44:10] atmosphere come over him what was it
[2:44:13] that was already in his soul the
[2:44:15] atmosphere the the word of divine love
[2:44:18] but now something begin to project
[2:44:21] itself and he begin to speak and he says
[2:44:24] to the bull bull I'm here on the
[2:44:26] commission of God and I'm a servant of
[2:44:28] God and I'm sorry I'm in your field but
[2:44:31] I'm going to pray for one of God's
[2:44:33] children and an atmosphere comes and the
[2:44:35] bull as he comes to that atmosphere
[2:44:38] brother Brown says he screeches to a hul
[2:44:41] and he looks this way and he looks that
[2:44:43] way it's like and he turns around
[2:44:45] totally defeated and goes and lays down
[2:44:48] under the tree what happened a the
[2:44:50] greatest power that there ever is was
[2:44:53] projected from a son of
[2:44:56] God all right let's go back to Portland
[2:44:58] here's now a demon-possessed man that
[2:45:01] willingly gave his life to the devil
[2:45:04] like the kind of power that he had
[2:45:05] brother Brown's 5 foot S I think he was
[2:45:08] or 5 foot 6 he's 140 pounds or less than
[2:45:11] that and he's and he's he couldn't
[2:45:13] physically put up any resistance and so
[2:45:16] he begins to look at the man and the man
[2:45:17] says you're just a lie are like the rest
[2:45:19] of them you're just vile you're a snake
[2:45:21] in the grass and he begins to call them
[2:45:23] all kinds of Nam what is happening here
[2:45:25] now catch What's Happening Here the
[2:45:27] devil is inspiring that man to say
[2:45:30] things to try and break brother
[2:45:33] brandom's
[2:45:34] thoughts because if he can change his
[2:45:37] thoughts he can get rid of the
[2:45:41] atmosphere but a prophet of God is
[2:45:44] trained in the
[2:45:45] word and he just stays there he says and
[2:45:48] what is begin to think about the man he
[2:45:50] says you know what he's just a man like
[2:45:52] I am he's probably got a wife he's
[2:45:56] probably got children he's thinking
[2:45:58] thoughts that are positive towards the
[2:46:01] man all right it's not the power of
[2:46:04] positive thinking but he's keeping
[2:46:06] himself in the right kind of an
[2:46:07] atmosphere now the devil knows over here
[2:46:09] in the giant of the man he knows he's
[2:46:11] not winning the battle and so he
[2:46:13] inspires him to do something
[2:46:16] else he's brother bramon
[2:46:19] he's racks his throat takes up some ugly
[2:46:24] gum from his throat and spits in his
[2:46:28] face brother Bram said the man spit in
[2:46:30] his
[2:46:32] face now if it's you or me that's game
[2:46:38] over all right you might be bigger than
[2:46:40] me but let's get this on right
[2:46:44] now but not brother Brandon he had a
[2:46:47] greater power than physical
[2:46:50] power he was trained in the word of God
[2:46:53] and the devil couldn't break the
[2:46:56] atmosphere that was there and the man
[2:46:58] spit in his face and said I'm going to
[2:47:01] knock you out into the audience and I'm
[2:47:03] going to break your jaw and brother
[2:47:05] Brandon was about to say I wouldn't do
[2:47:07] that sir he's not just as a Son of God
[2:47:10] but now as he begins to speak it's no
[2:47:13] longer him but now Divine love now this
[2:47:15] is the key of divine love begins to
[2:47:17] speak through him but it's not sir I
[2:47:20] love you sir you're so nice you're so
[2:47:23] wonderful no Divine love is being
[2:47:25] projected here the greatest power that
[2:47:27] there is and says because you have
[2:47:30] defied the servant of the Living God you
[2:47:33] will fall over my feet this day that man
[2:47:37] didn't know who he was speaking to he
[2:47:40] had stepped on the inheritance of a Son
[2:47:42] of God he was like Goliath that had come
[2:47:46] over to Israel he was a champion on the
[2:47:48] devil 's ground but when he stepped on
[2:47:50] Israel's inheritance David Rose up and
[2:47:53] says who is he to defy the armies of the
[2:47:56] Living God he's a defeated enemy because
[2:47:59] he's on our rightful
[2:48:01] inheritance and so there was a servant
[2:48:04] of God standing there God began to speak
[2:48:06] through him but the man wasn't done he
[2:48:08] said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall
[2:48:10] over and he made a fatal mistake he took
[2:48:13] another step forward into that
[2:48:16] atmosphere and as he began to raise up
[2:48:19] his fist brother Brown says that
[2:48:20] atmosphere begin to take over just like
[2:48:23] it did on the bull in the field and he
[2:48:25] begin to take that man and he fought
[2:48:28] with all of his strength 6'8 total
[2:48:30] muscle all of that he fought against it
[2:48:32] with everything that he could inspired
[2:48:35] by demon power and where did he end up
[2:48:37] on the
[2:48:38] ground did Brother Bram lay a finger on
[2:48:41] him no he never touched him what
[2:48:44] happened Divine love was
[2:48:47] projected but because there was nothing
[2:48:50] in the man to respond to Divine love he
[2:48:55] fell under the power of a living
[2:48:59] God oh you say brother Tim was that
[2:49:01] Divine love projected that's exactly
[2:49:03] what happened to the Rich Young
[2:49:05] Ruler I'll close with this
[2:49:08] thought the Rich Young Ruler comes to
[2:49:10] Jesus what must I do to have eternal
[2:49:12] life it's a good
[2:49:13] question repent be baptized in the name
[2:49:15] of Jesus Christ you shall receive the
[2:49:17] gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:49:19] all right but in that day Jesus said you
[2:49:22] know the law you know the Commandments
[2:49:23] he says I've done these things from my
[2:49:24] youth Jesus looking on him projected
[2:49:28] love to
[2:49:30] him catch it now he's now going to
[2:49:33] receive something from God he's going to
[2:49:35] receive the message of his day projected
[2:49:40] right to him as Jesus said take my yoke
[2:49:43] upon you for my yoke is easy and my
[2:49:46] burden is light no man can come unto me
[2:49:48] except he except he take up his cross
[2:49:50] and follow me and all of these
[2:49:52] statements now is going to be projected
[2:49:55] Divine love through the message of the
[2:49:57] hour is going to be projected to this
[2:49:59] man I'll tell you what your problem is
[2:50:02] here's Jesus in his prophetic office
[2:50:04] Discerning the problem I'll tell you
[2:50:07] what your problem is but you're going to
[2:50:08] have to make a decision all right your
[2:50:11] problem is you love money your problem
[2:50:15] is you have too many possession he
[2:50:16] didn't use those words but I'm I'm
[2:50:18] telling you what the thought process is
[2:50:20] your problem is that you're so loving
[2:50:23] the world and the things of the world
[2:50:25] you got to get rid of it and you got to
[2:50:27] take drastic measures in your life and
[2:50:29] you got to sell it
[2:50:30] out go sell all that you have and give
[2:50:34] it to the poor and come and take up your
[2:50:37] cross and follow
[2:50:39] me that was the love of God projected
[2:50:42] see when this message goes to somebody
[2:50:44] it's the love of God projected to them
[2:50:47] it's not correction it's it's not it's
[2:50:49] not chastisement God only chastises
[2:50:51] those that he loves those who are his
[2:50:54] children those he receives as his own
[2:50:57] son but before that it's love projected
[2:51:00] to them in whatever form that person
[2:51:02] needs it that's why you the Bible says
[2:51:05] don't be scared to give an answer when
[2:51:07] you come before unbelievers when you
[2:51:09] come before a judge or something because
[2:51:11] God will bring to your remembrance God
[2:51:13] will bring out of your soul of divine
[2:51:16] love to your remembrance the things that
[2:51:18] need to be projected in that kind of a
[2:51:22] situation and so it was projected to
[2:51:25] this man and he said the Bible says he
[2:51:28] heard the message that's my words he
[2:51:31] heard the message and the message
[2:51:33] grieved
[2:51:35] him he me heard the message and the
[2:51:38] message saddened
[2:51:41] him before the foundation of the world
[2:51:45] God saw in his thoughts when I send my
[2:51:47] message to my Sons they will shout for
[2:51:52] joyl
[2:51:54] Hallelujah when I send my message they
[2:51:56] won't be
[2:51:58] sad when I send my message they won't be
[2:52:01] grieved when I send my love projected in
[2:52:04] word form it won't cause them to
[2:52:07] decrease they will only
[2:52:09] increase they can't reject the word
[2:52:12] because they are my word for that hour
[2:52:16] and I send my quickening power to to
[2:52:18] them that they might manifest my
[2:52:21] attributes in the day that they're
[2:52:23] living
[2:52:27] in I'll be done before 1:00 I'm about to
[2:52:32] close
[2:52:34] now you know brother brother that was
[2:52:37] one of the times brother Ben stepped all
[2:52:39] over my
[2:52:40] notes when he began to talk about
[2:52:42] brother brandom coming
[2:52:44] home as a Son of God an attribute of God
[2:52:48] dominion over his children his wife all
[2:52:51] of that kind of stuff he comes into the
[2:52:53] house the wife is at the sink washing
[2:52:55] the dishes crying the children are
[2:52:58] fighting in the corner the whole house
[2:53:00] is in
[2:53:01] disarray and he didn't put one foot on
[2:53:03] the carpet and one foot on the
[2:53:06] lolium and raise his hands and swear by
[2:53:09] him that liveth forever and ever I am a
[2:53:12] prophet of
[2:53:13] God I want you all to come subject to my
[2:53:16] words right now
[2:53:19] no that wasn't projecting Divine
[2:53:21] love he took out the greatest power that
[2:53:24] there was amen
[2:53:27] Brothers he took out the greatest power
[2:53:29] there
[2:53:31] was an
[2:53:35] [Applause]
[2:53:39] apron and he got up beside his wife
[2:53:42] started drying the dishes how you doing
[2:53:44] dear I'm doing miserable I haven't eat
[2:53:48] dish think the kids are fighting and
[2:53:50] everything's going wrong today and I
[2:53:52] think I'm dying and the world is falling
[2:53:54] apart and everything it's all right dear
[2:53:57] it's all right everything's all right
[2:53:59] don't everything's not all
[2:54:03] right thought Lord he prayed for her
[2:54:05] like brother Ben said he prayed he
[2:54:07] prayed Lord he put his hand on his
[2:54:09] wife's shoulder it's all right dear but
[2:54:10] inside he's
[2:54:11] praying Lord give me the wisdom of how
[2:54:14] to project love in this situation
[2:54:18] what is going to turn her around what is
[2:54:21] going to change her thoughts he gets the
[2:54:24] secret phrase of Supernatural words from
[2:54:28] God I saw a
[2:54:35] dress oh
[2:54:38] my and you all are laughing like it's
[2:54:41] but it's serious he got an inspiration
[2:54:44] from God remember that dress you saw
[2:54:47] tell her about it right now
[2:54:51] that's going to break the atmosphere
[2:54:52] that she's in and grab her attention
[2:54:55] towards the atmosphere that you're
[2:54:56] trying to
[2:54:58] create oh my
[2:55:04] what projecting Love by talking about a
[2:55:08] dress and then he talks about something
[2:55:11] even more Supernatural sisters listen to
[2:55:14] this now she says but he says we should
[2:55:16] go down and look at that dress she says
[2:55:17] we haven't haven't even eaten yet he
[2:55:19] says well I'll cook
[2:55:23] supper that was even more
[2:55:28] Supernatural praise the Lord he's
[2:55:30] projecting an atmosphere here and she
[2:55:33] says you can't cook supper you don't
[2:55:35] know how to cook what he says you've
[2:55:37] never eaten brandom fried
[2:55:40] potatoes praise the Lord what is he
[2:55:43] doing he's creating an atmosphere he's
[2:55:45] realizing the devil at demon Spirits
[2:55:49] have been around people have been
[2:55:50] through the house all these kind of
[2:55:51] things and he thought first of all I
[2:55:53] need to bring my wife under subjection
[2:55:55] he doesn't do it reverse and say well if
[2:55:57] I spank the children and get them in
[2:55:59] order then maybe the wife will come
[2:56:00] around and I'll be able to deal with her
[2:56:02] and you know he doesn't move into the
[2:56:03] Physical Realm he moves into his
[2:56:06] Dominion as a Son of God I have a right
[2:56:10] to create an atmosphere here and those
[2:56:12] that are in the atmosphere will be uh
[2:56:15] affected by it that's the same as what
[2:56:17] brother Bram said in the token under the
[2:56:19] token you create an atmosphere that
[2:56:22] others come into that atmosphere and are
[2:56:25] affected by the things that you
[2:56:27] say all right so he's projecting this
[2:56:29] atmosphere and before you know it he's
[2:56:32] frying up the potatoes or whatever he's
[2:56:33] doing and and all of a sudden the
[2:56:35] children stopped fighting all on their
[2:56:38] own didn't need to spank them didn't
[2:56:40] need to send them to the room or
[2:56:41] anything else what was he doing he was
[2:56:43] operating as a mature Son of God
[2:56:48] praise the Lord Brothers brother brandom

[3:01:47] wrong
[3:01:48] you come under the Divine preaching of
[3:01:50] the word and God by the revelation of
[3:01:53] the word has changed your atmosphere
[3:01:56] I'll tell you this much when I when I
[3:01:58] got married I was 20 years old for the
[3:02:00] next two years I I wasn't a very nice
[3:02:02] husband I wasn't a real positive man
[3:02:04] because I wasn't in the message I wasn't
[3:02:06] I didn't know I was in a denomination
[3:02:08] and my wife and I had fusses and
[3:02:10] arguments just like any couple but then
[3:02:12] the word of God came by our way and when
[3:02:16] this word of this message quickened us
[3:02:19] from that time to the till the time my
[3:02:22] wife passed away we had not one single
[3:02:26] argument that's the space of 28
[3:02:30] years what does that the word does that
[3:02:35] but as you've been brought into that
[3:02:36] atmosphere now he tells the woman you go
[3:02:39] give that atmosphere to your husband now
[3:02:41] he didn't say go home take your Bible
[3:02:43] read it pray get down fast and do all
[3:02:45] those kind of things he says no sister
[3:02:47] go home home cook your husband a nice
[3:02:49] apple pie must have known that he loved
[3:02:50] that and he comes in
[3:02:52] tonight throw both your arms around
[3:02:56] him spread the atmosphere kiss your
[3:03:00] husband set him
[3:03:02] down get up on his
[3:03:04] lap what is he saying behave like a lady
[3:03:07] ought to be in love with your
[3:03:10] husband don't let anything come between
[3:03:13] the love that you and your husband have
[3:03:16] and if something has happened there get
[3:03:18] a change of atmosphere and go back and
[3:03:20] start it
[3:03:22] again it's getting awful quiet here
[3:03:24] either you stop pulling or Stop
