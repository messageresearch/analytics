[0:00] the the the
[0:03] whole way of victory in our life, Lord,
[0:04] is just to spend time with you, Lord.
[0:06] And that if you're for us, and who can
[0:07] be against us?
[0:08] So, we're so grateful for your calling
[0:10] in our life, Lord. And we're so grateful
[0:11] that you are for us.
[0:13] Hallelujah.
[0:13] And we're so grateful, Lord, that we can
[0:14] come and spend time with you and be
[0:16] refreshed, renewed, empowered,
[0:18] encouraged, Lord, that we can be vibrant
[0:21] people full of life.
[0:22] Hallelujah.
[0:23] And full of hope, full of joy.
[0:25] Hallelujah. full of happiness, full of
[0:28] longsuffering, full of patience and
[0:29] goodness, peace,
[0:32] meekness, temperance, Lord, all the
[0:33] wonderful things that come from you.
[0:34] We're so grateful, Lord, that that
[0:36] within you is an abundance of all those
[0:38] things.
[0:38] Hallelujah.
[0:39] So, Lord, we just come to that fountain
[0:40] of life this morning, Lord, just to to
[0:42] drink from the fountain of life, which
[0:44] is you.
[0:45] Lord, you said you have come that we
[0:47] might have life and we might have it
[0:48] more abundantly, Lord. So, we we thank
[0:50] you that we can have an abundant life in
[0:51] you. And we just want to invite you into
[0:53] our midst this morning. Bless those that
[0:55] couldn't make it, those that are unwell
[0:56] in different things. Bless those that
[0:58] are streaming. And we just um yeah, we
[1:00] just want to pray you bless the word
[1:01] this morning. Bless Pastor Benjamin as
[1:02] he brings brings the word,
[1:04] Lord. And may you just continue to
[1:06] anoint him. We thank you for the
[1:07] blessing that he is to us. And we thank
[1:09] you for each person here, Lord, that
[1:10] that do their part in the body of
[1:12] Christ. It's such a wonderful thing to
[1:14] be able to come here and and worship
[1:15] you, Lord, with saints of like precious
[1:17] faith.
[1:18] So, we just commit this service to you
[1:19] this morning and we just humbly invite
[1:21] you into our midst once again in Jesus
[1:22] name. Amen.
[1:25] Amen. Um
[1:28] when um
[1:31] when Jesus walked along the road to
[1:33] Emmas with the the um two disciples,
[1:37] when he got to the I guess when they got
[1:39] to where they were going, he said, "I'm
[1:40] just going to carry on for a while. You
[1:41] know, I'm going to carry on." But then
[1:43] the Bible says they constrained him.
[1:45] They said, "No, why don't you stay
[1:46] here?" And I don't know what the
[1:48] discussion was, but I don't think they
[1:49] they didn't just say, "Oh, stay here."
[1:51] He says, "No, carry on." They said,
[1:52] "Okay." They would said, "No, no, no.
[1:54] Where are you going?" You know, "No,
[1:55] stay here with us. Come on. We've got
[1:56] some food in here. We've got this. We've
[1:57] got that. Come on. Come on." "No, maybe
[1:58] I won't." "No, no, come on. Come on.
[2:00] Come in. We'd like to have you. We've
[2:01] enjoyed the fellowship with you." And I
[2:03] think they they constrained him so much
[2:05] that he really felt welcome and he came
[2:06] in and then he revealed himself to them.
[2:08] So, let's make the Lord feel welcome
[2:09] this morning with our with our hearts
[2:11] and all that we are. Amen. Uh we'll
[2:13] stand and sing. Um lift up your heads,

[47:01] still must be fulfilled. But he has
[47:03] already come.
[47:04] Amen. In in in word form and spirit form
[47:08] EVERYTHING GOD IS ALL healing
[47:10] all redemption.
[47:11] AMEN.
[47:11] HALLELUJAH.
[47:12] ALL YOU KNOW ALL reconciliation you know
[47:14] everything you have need of is present.
[47:16] Hallelujah.
[47:17] Amen. Upon this earth.
[47:18] Amen.
[47:19] Everything.
[47:20] Amen. And that's why I really want to
[47:21] hammer that in because we got to
[47:23] recognize God isn't just up in heaven
[47:25] some distance someone somewhere
[47:27] someplace sometime but God is present
[47:29] among us
[47:30] and not just in these four walls BUT
[47:32] WHEREVER YOU GO ALL OF HEAVEN IS with
[47:34] you.
[47:35] I mean all that God is is with you.
[47:37] Amen.
[47:38] Hallelujah.
[47:39] So now the word revelation
[47:42] hallelujah
[47:42] the word because you got to oh the world
[47:44] is dark. Sure the world is dark but the
[47:47] light has never been so bright.
[47:49] Amen. The glory of God has never been so
[47:51] glorious upon the earth.
[47:53] It's never been so never been a day like
[47:55] this day.
[47:56] There's never been a day like this day.
[47:59] And it's more than just I tell you, if
[48:01] this anchors into your soul, you'll be a
[48:02] different person.
[48:03] Hallelujah.
[48:04] Hallelujah.
[48:05] Amen.
[48:06] Now, the word revelation in the Greek,
[48:09] it means an unveiling.
[48:11] Yeah. It means an unveiling.
[48:13] It means it means to take off the cover.
[48:16] So something that's been covered up now
[48:19] it's going to be revealed.
[48:21] Yep. Just like a statue or some piece of
[48:23] artwork or a plaque that you know
[48:25] there's a curtain and they pull the pull
[48:27] the curtain and you know there's the
[48:28] plaque of a founding of a building or
[48:29] something. That's the revelation of that
[48:32] plaque
[48:33] or a statue that's covered up. Now I'm
[48:35] going to show you the revelation of the
[48:37] statue and then the sheet comes off
[48:38] and then you see what's hidden.
[48:40] Yeah.
[48:41] Amen. So like a statue you can kind of
[48:44] see the form of it. you kind of have an
[48:45] idea what it'll be, but then it's when
[48:48] the cover comes off
[48:50] and then you really see what it is.
[48:52] Right
[48:53] now, I want to make this statement. I'm
[48:56] just going to make this statement right
[48:57] now.
[48:58] Revelation, I'll just find it in my
[49:00] notes. Now, when we think of revelation,
[49:04] the world thinks of revelation as a
[49:06] mental understanding,
[49:07] right?
[49:08] Amen. But a revelation is when he makes
[49:13] himself known to you.
[49:15] That's right.
[49:16] Okay. And he can only make himself known
[49:19] to you if he's present.
[49:22] You follow me? I want to be very
[49:23] deliberate in this fact because you got
[49:25] to understand this. He has to be present
[49:27] in order to reveal himself.
[49:30] Because it's like myself. Just say if I
[49:33] wrote a biography of me,
[49:36] okay, and I gave that to you, you would
[49:38] just learn about me.
[49:40] Yeah. You would just learn about me. But
[49:43] then if I turned up to your house and I
[49:45] begin to spend time with you, then you
[49:47] would begin to really know me.
[49:49] Amen.
[49:50] Then I would be revealed to you.
[49:53] Amen. It's it's a massive difference.
[49:55] And you got to understand it. God has to
[49:57] be present in order to give you
[49:59] revelation.
[50:01] Amen. He has to be present. And we'll go
[50:02] through the life of Abraham. I'll show
[50:04] you this all the way through the
[50:05] scripture. God has to be present to give
[50:08] you revelation.
[50:09] So you got to understand when you hear
[50:11] the word or when you're reading or when
[50:13] you're in prayer and God quicken
[50:15] something to your soul, it's because
[50:16] he's present.
[50:18] Amen. He's not it's not you learning
[50:20] something or understanding something,
[50:23] just reading a book, but God himself
[50:26] comes into the room
[50:28] and quickens that word. He reveals part
[50:30] of himself.
[50:32] Amen. He reveals part of himself.
[50:34] Amen.
[50:35] Hallelujah. Just like in a relationship.
[50:38] Amen. You could have, you know, just
[50:40] like you, I don't know, you know, just
[50:42] say if like if someone had like a long
[50:44] distance, just an email or letter on the
[50:47] phone relationship.
[50:48] That'd be really a lot of you would
[50:50] maybe catch a bit of what that person's
[50:52] like. But when you really meet that
[50:54] person, you spend time with that person,
[50:56] then you really know that person. That's
[50:58] right.
[50:58] Amen. And there's a massive chasm
[51:01] between mental understanding, just
[51:04] reading about him
[51:05] and knowing him.
[51:08] And you know him because he's present.
[51:12] Now,
[51:14] God through the ages has been revealing
[51:16] himself.
[51:19] I want you to turn to
[51:23] um I want you to go to Exodus chapter 6.
[51:27] And I know I've been through these
[51:28] things before.
[51:35] Got Exodus chapter 6
[51:45] and verse one.
[51:53] And the Lord said unto Moses,
[51:58] "How now shall thou see what I will do
[52:02] to Pharaoh? For with a strong hand shall
[52:05] he let thee them go, and with a strong
[52:08] hand shall he drive them out of his
[52:09] land."
[52:10] Amen.
[52:11] And God spake unto Moses, and said unto
[52:13] him, I am the Lord. And I appeared unto
[52:16] Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by
[52:18] the name of God Almighty. Pardon me.
[52:21] But by my name Jehovah, was I not known
[52:24] to them.
[52:26] And I have also established my covenant
[52:29] with them to give them the land of
[52:30] Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage,
[52:33] ruined they were strangers. Now if you
[52:35] go read the book of Genesis when it says
[52:39] the Lord spoke to Abraham or the Lord
[52:41] spoke to Isaac or Jacob, you go look at
[52:43] the meaning of that word I mean that
[52:45] name and that word is actually Jehovah
[52:48] but they did not know God as a
[52:51] deliverer.
[52:53] Yeah. So that expression remember the
[52:55] name how God is revealing himself is
[52:58] tied in with the name.
[53:00] Y amen. So how God reveals remember in
[53:03] him is to be a father,
[53:05] to be a son, to be a redeemer, to be a
[53:08] savior, to be a husband, to be a healer,
[53:11] to be a high priest, to be a sacrifice,
[53:14] to be an advocate, to be a help, to be a
[53:17] guide, to be a king, all and many more
[53:20] of his attributes are in him. But then
[53:22] now when he comes to the earth and is
[53:24] and the name he uses when he speaks to
[53:26] people, he's revealing part of himself.
[53:29] So he's going to give those people, he's
[53:31] revealing himself, revelation of who he
[53:33] is
[53:34] or revelation of part of his character.
[53:36] And so they did not know him as Jehovah
[53:39] because Abraham never needed to be
[53:41] delivered.
[53:42] Amen. Out of out of slavery. Jacob
[53:45] didn't need that. You know, Isaac didn't
[53:47] need that. So he was going to reveal
[53:50] part of himself to Moses and the
[53:52] children of Israel that they Abraham and
[53:54] that did not know.
[53:56] All right? And so
[53:59] this now now but Abraham knew God in
[54:03] many different ways
[54:05] and it was God was present. Remember we
[54:08] are the sons and daughters of Abraham.
[54:10] Yeah.
[54:11] So God was present with Abraham when he
[54:15] revealed himself to Abraham.
[54:17] Amen.
[54:18] Are you following me? He wasn't
[54:20] somewhere else. He was standing there.
[54:23] However, whatever form he was in, God
[54:26] was there.
[54:26] Amen.
[54:27] Amen.
[54:28] Amen.
[54:29] Amen. He wasn't He wasn't He was
[54:30] present.
[54:32] And he was going to reveal parts of
[54:34] himself to Abraham.
[54:35] Hallelujah.
[54:36] And so in Genesis 12 and verse one, it
[54:39] says, "Now the Lord said unto Abraham,
[54:41] get thee out of thy country and out of
[54:43] thy kindred and from my father's house
[54:45] into a land that I will show thee." And
[54:47] that word there is is is Jehovah. And
[54:50] so, but then God would come down in
[54:52] Genesis, I think it was 17.
[54:55] No, no, sorry. Before this, as as
[54:57] Malchazdc,
[54:58] as as the priest and king
[55:01] and so now, it was the same God that
[55:04] called him in Genesis 12 was now
[55:06] revealing himself in a different way.
[55:08] Amen.
[55:10] And then after that, in Genesis chapter
[55:11] 17, God came down as El Shadi or the
[55:15] strength giver like a like a like a
[55:17] mother nurses a baby. I mean
[55:19] breastfeeding like I am now the strength
[55:21] giver.
[55:22] So all of this he was in the beginning
[55:25] but as Abraham was walking with God was
[55:28] revealing different parts of himself to
[55:30] Abraham.
[55:31] Amen. If you took a trinitarian idea
[55:34] because how did the trinitarians work?
[55:36] They see well there was like they take
[55:39] Matthew chapter 4. Well, there no end of
[55:41] Matthew chapter 3, chapter 4, you know,
[55:44] and so there's there's Jesus coming to
[55:45] get baptized and then they say, "Well,
[55:48] there's the son and then there's a voice
[55:50] coming out of heaven. So there's the
[55:52] father, a different God. And now here
[55:54] comes the spirit of God like a dove
[55:55] descending upon him." Well, that's the
[55:56] Holy Ghost. Look, there's three of them.
[55:58] But if you take So what they've done is
[56:00] they've taken a manifestation of God and
[56:02] they've separated out into a different
[56:04] God.
[56:05] Remember, because oh, we believe in
[56:07] three persons in the Godhead. Well, to
[56:09] be a person, you have to be a
[56:10] personality.
[56:12] There's more than three people in this
[56:14] room.
[56:15] Amen. But we're all different
[56:16] personalities.
[56:17] So they So they're saying three
[56:19] different gods.
[56:20] But if you can go back to the Old
[56:21] Testament, you say, "Well, there's
[56:22] actually at least eight."
[56:24] Yep. That's right.
[56:25] If you take their point of view and you
[56:27] go into the scripture because you see,
[56:28] well, there's Jehovah, there's Al Shadi,
[56:31] there's Mazdc, we know which had no
[56:33] beginning of days or end of life, no
[56:35] father or mother. That has to be God.
[56:37] Amen. And then he was the angel of the
[56:39] covenant.
[56:39] Yeah.
[56:40] Amen.
[56:41] Amen. Gideon saw him as an old man with
[56:43] a staff.
[56:44] There's another one.
[56:45] How many have we got?
[56:47] That's right.
[56:48] But it's the same God revealing himself
[56:50] down through the word.
[56:52] Amen. But you have to understand he is a
[56:56] he has to be there in order to reveal
[56:59] himself.
[57:00] Amen. He has to personally come. He had
[57:03] to personally come to Abraham and reveal
[57:06] himself to Abraham. Gideon, he had to
[57:08] personally be there.
[57:10] You know, Gideon, you're a mighty man of
[57:12] valor.
[57:13] Yeah.
[57:14] You know, and then and then Gideon's
[57:16] very honest. He says, "If God is with
[57:17] us, where are the miracles?"
[57:20] Amen. And so, but get God had to be
[57:23] there in order to reveal to Gideon,
[57:25] you're actually a mighty man of hell.
[57:28] And if you just walk with me, this enemy
[57:30] is going to be done away with.
[57:32] But he had to personally be there.
[57:33] Hallelujah. Amen.
[57:34] You understand?
[57:36] Amen.
[57:36] You may say, "Well, this is very
[57:38] elementary." No, you understand God.
[57:42] You know, you could you could. Now, you
[57:43] wouldn't because you can't physically
[57:45] rewrite the Bible, but you could put
[57:47] yourself in Abraham's life.
[57:49] Yeah.
[57:49] Amen.
[57:50] And the Lord appeared unto Ian or Arand
[57:53] or Edwan or anyone here
[57:56] and said, "Leave this.
[57:59] Leave this old way. Follow me."
[58:02] Amen.
[58:02] Amen. And then he came as, you know,
[58:04] because he was, you know, he revealed
[58:06] himself as Jehovah Gyra.
[58:08] The Lord himself will provide a
[58:10] sacrifice.
[58:11] Amen.
[58:11] Amen.
[58:12] Amen. When he went to um sacrifice Isaac
[58:15] and Jesus was Jehovah's provided
[58:18] sacrifice. He provided himself a
[58:20] sacrifice.
[58:22] Amen. Now, so I don't want to jump
[58:25] around too much, but then it says now
[58:27] the Lord appeared on the plains of
[58:29] memory in Genesis 18. The Lord appeared
[58:32] unto him, Abraham in the plains of
[58:34] memory and he sat down in the tent or in
[58:36] the heat of the day.
[58:37] Hallelujah.
[58:38] So Abraham was there and he saw three
[58:40] men walking
[58:42] and they were physically men because
[58:44] they sat down and they had a meal with
[58:45] Abraham.
[58:47] Amen. So here was now but pardon me
[58:49] notice if you read the account God
[58:52] Abraham says to one of them Lord
[58:56] my lord singular
[58:57] come and stay here
[58:59] and then after after they have their
[59:02] discussion two of them get up and they
[59:03] go to Sodom it says but the Lord stays
[59:05] behind and tells Abraham
[59:07] what's going to shortly take place.
[59:10] Amen.
[59:11] And now that's why
[59:14] we know where we are in the word.
[59:18] Amen. We know where we are in time.
[59:21] We're not guessing where we are.
[59:23] And it's not because everyone on their
[59:26] Charisma News or whatever kind of thing
[59:28] is saying, "Look, the world is ending."
[59:30] That is not the reason we know where we
[59:32] are. We know where we are because we've
[59:34] had a visitation of God in flesh.
[59:36] Amen.
[59:37] Amen. where God would take a redeemed a
[59:40] redeemed man. So, a man that was born in
[59:42] sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the
[59:44] world speaking lies, and he would
[59:46] surrender his life.
[59:48] Amen. And God would God would come and
[59:50] dwell in that man
[59:52] and God would make himself known.
[59:54] Amen.
[59:55] Amen. That's exactly what happened.
[59:58] And but it's the same thing. It's the
[1:00:01] same thing, friends, with you and I.
[1:00:05] Because the last manifestation of God
[1:00:08] before Sodom was burnt is that God was
[1:00:11] manifested in human flesh.
[1:00:13] Amen.
[1:00:14] God was manifested in human flesh. And I
[1:00:17] want to put it to you today, that's just
[1:00:19] not the prophet's ministry.
[1:00:21] Amen. But that's your ministry.
[1:00:23] Amen. Because the last manifestation of
[1:00:26] God upon the earth before the rapture is
[1:00:29] that God has put on human skin once
[1:00:31] again.
[1:00:32] And not just in a prophet, but in a many
[1:00:34] membered body.
[1:00:35] Amen. Where God would step down into
[1:00:37] your flesh. He would take your dust.
[1:00:40] Amen. Your body WHICH ONCE GLORIFIED
[1:00:43] SATAN.
[1:00:44] AMEN. Which once you worshiped in some
[1:00:46] religious system or was just in the
[1:00:48] world someplace and you actually giving
[1:00:51] glory to the devil.
[1:00:52] Amen. But then God came down.
[1:00:54] Amen.
[1:00:55] Hallelujah. And laid claim upon you
[1:00:57] because you don't belong to Satan. You
[1:00:59] never belong to Satan.
[1:01:00] Amen. You've got to recognize. You got
[1:01:02] to look the devil in the eyes AND SAY,
[1:01:04] "DEVIL, I'M NOT YOUR PROPERTY.
[1:01:06] I NEVER WAS YOUR PROPERTY. I BELONG TO
[1:01:08] GOD."
[1:01:09] AMEN.
[1:01:10] HALLELUJAH. And then so God now takes
[1:01:12] claim upon you.
[1:01:14] What is redemption? God puts his hand
[1:01:16] upon you
[1:01:17] and says, "This is my son. This is my
[1:01:20] daughter. Satan, you have no right to
[1:01:22] hold them anymore.
[1:01:23] Hallelujah. And God lays claim.
[1:01:26] And whatever God lays claim upon,
[1:01:28] nothing can stand against that claim.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah.
[1:01:33] Everything must move.
[1:01:34] When God says, "This is mine."
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:36] Hallelujah.
[1:01:37] Amen.
[1:01:38] That's why that's why the Holy Spirit is
[1:01:40] very zealous of his church.
[1:01:42] Amen. God is very zealous of his bride
[1:01:45] because he doesn't want anything to
[1:01:46] touch her.
[1:01:48] Amen. He doesn't want her to be
[1:01:49] manhandled.
[1:01:50] He doesn't want her to be manhandled by
[1:01:52] the creeds of man.
[1:01:54] He doesn't want her to be manhandled by
[1:01:56] the world.
[1:01:57] Amen. He wants her pure, spotless in the
[1:01:59] washed in the blood of the lamb.
[1:02:01] And that's God's desire.
[1:02:05] Amen.
[1:02:07] So now the last manifestation I want you
[1:02:10] to understand, you are the last
[1:02:12] manifestation
[1:02:14] of God upon the earth before the
[1:02:16] rapture. Right.
[1:02:17] The bride is God in flesh.
[1:02:20] Amen.
[1:02:23] You understand?
[1:02:25] You have to You have to be able to say
[1:02:27] Jesus is in me.
[1:02:28] That's right.
[1:02:30] Amen. Because I met him.
[1:02:32] That's right.
[1:02:33] Amen. He's not just God above us in the
[1:02:35] Old Testament or God with us as Jesus in
[1:02:38] the body of flesh, but he says, "I'll be
[1:02:40] with you, but now I'm going to be in
[1:02:42] you."
[1:02:43] Amen. And we're living in the time where
[1:02:44] it's not just God with us or or or above
[1:02:47] us, but God in us.
[1:02:49] As the Apostle Paul said, Christ in you,
[1:02:51] the hope of glory.
[1:02:52] So, who has the hope of glory?
[1:02:55] Hallelujah. Hey, it is what it is.
[1:02:57] Amen. You've got to be able to just come
[1:02:59] to the reconciliation OF THE FACT GOD is
[1:03:01] in me.
[1:03:02] That's right.
[1:03:04] Amen.
[1:03:05] Praise God.
[1:03:07] Remember,
[1:03:10] I'm just going to read this. This is
[1:03:12] brother Bradam and uh questions and
[1:03:13] answers on the seals. He says, "Heavenly
[1:03:16] Father, with your great presence laying
[1:03:17] here, the great Holy Spirit, the one we
[1:03:20] have the picture of, that's why we have
[1:03:22] it in the front there. The one that we
[1:03:25] read in the Bible, he's present right
[1:03:27] here." Now,
[1:03:29] amen. He is revealing himself through
[1:03:32] human flesh.
[1:03:34] You got to put yourself in this.
[1:03:35] Remember this is not remember Jesus
[1:03:38] Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:03:40] today and forever.
[1:03:43] Amen. So what he did in the ministry of
[1:03:45] the prophet he is continuing to do in
[1:03:48] his bride.
[1:03:49] Amen.
[1:03:49] Amen. The same life, the same works.
[1:03:53] Amen. The same walk is in her.
[1:03:56] Amen.
[1:03:56] Amen. That's why we don't just point to
[1:03:59] a founder and say, "Look at what
[1:04:00] everything God did through brother
[1:04:01] Brandon." But we should be able to say,
[1:04:03] "He's the same today. We serve a living
[1:04:06] God and he does the same thing.
[1:04:08] Amen. Because if we just have a history
[1:04:10] or a tradition, this is a dead formal
[1:04:13] work and let's get rid of it and find
[1:04:15] something that lives. But we have
[1:04:16] something that lives.
[1:04:18] And it's not just enthusiasm or some
[1:04:20] excitement. It's the reality that Jesus
[1:04:22] has risen from the dead.
[1:04:24] Amen. He's not in a tomb.
[1:04:26] And you're not in a tomb either.
[1:04:28] Amen.
[1:04:28] Amen. Of this world or some tradition of
[1:04:30] man.
[1:04:31] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:32] Hey, this world tried to seal you up.
[1:04:35] Amen. It tried to keep you dead in some
[1:04:37] any kind of way.
[1:04:39] Doesn't matter if it was religion or the
[1:04:41] world or everything in between, culture,
[1:04:43] whatever it was. The world tried to seal
[1:04:46] you up.
[1:04:47] Amen. But it's like a bunch of, you
[1:04:49] know, plants that have been buried in
[1:04:51] concrete. That thing will worm its way
[1:04:52] around. It'll come forth as sure as it
[1:04:55] as sure as there's a tomorrow.
[1:04:57] Amen. So, it doesn't matter how much
[1:04:58] concrete the devil tries to pour over
[1:05:00] your life. Amen. There's a sun shining
[1:05:02] and there's something in you knowing
[1:05:04] that there's a light that it must reach
[1:05:05] out to.
[1:05:07] Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] Amen.
[1:05:09] We serve a living God.
[1:05:12] Amen.
[1:05:13] He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:05:14] forever.
[1:05:15] That means he doesn't change
[1:05:18] in in any way.
[1:05:19] Amen.
[1:05:20] Our character may mellow with age. It
[1:05:22] may get different with age, but he is
[1:05:25] exactly the same.
[1:05:27] He does not change whatsoever.
[1:05:30] Now,
[1:05:33] We know sorry I'll go back here now. Now
[1:05:35] we've seen him without one time failing
[1:05:38] through the years
[1:05:40] to be able to reveal the very thoughts
[1:05:41] of the heart to reveal the sin that they
[1:05:44] did. Tell them exactly what happened and
[1:05:45] what will be without one time failing.
[1:05:48] Then we know that the God of Abraham,
[1:05:50] Isaac and of Israel still remains God in
[1:05:53] the person of Jesus Christ. And by now
[1:05:55] by his spirit descending from heaven
[1:05:58] under the blood that was shed at
[1:06:00] Calvary, coming down among people to
[1:06:02] make himself manifested in human flesh
[1:06:05] just before the burning of the world.
[1:06:07] The great Holy Spirit represented in
[1:06:11] human flesh. Those precious people who
[1:06:14] has been who has accepted the blood
[1:06:16] atonement and the Holy Spirit takes into
[1:06:19] their being God represented in human
[1:06:22] flesh. Therefore, it would not be the
[1:06:24] human flesh only just to perform the act
[1:06:27] like in baptism and so forth with a
[1:06:29] commission that these signs shall follow
[1:06:31] them that believe by laying hands on the
[1:06:33] sick. The Holy Spirit would see to it
[1:06:35] that they got well
[1:06:37] if they had believed.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:40] So, we are living it. Remember the
[1:06:42] scripture says in in Luke 17, as it was
[1:06:44] the days of Lot, so shall be when the
[1:06:46] son of man is revealed.
[1:06:48] That's not just brother Brandham's
[1:06:49] ministry. Amen. Cuz that same one that
[1:06:52] was that was you could say in one man is
[1:06:56] now in a many membered body.
[1:06:58] Amen.
[1:07:00] And that's why you can go around the
[1:07:01] world pretty much every country under
[1:07:04] heaven and you can find a group of
[1:07:06] believers that know the same God you
[1:07:08] know.
[1:07:09] And he does the same things here. He
[1:07:11] does the same things around the world.
[1:07:13] Amen. Because God is manifesting himself
[1:07:16] in human flesh
[1:07:17] just like he did before the burning of
[1:07:19] Sodom.
[1:07:21] Hallelujah.
[1:07:23] Now,
[1:07:25] God through the Old Testament revealed
[1:07:27] himself
[1:07:28] and we know that there are seven
[1:07:30] compound names of Jehovah.
[1:07:32] We all know that, do we not?
[1:07:34] So, just like in Genesis 20 uh in
[1:07:36] Genesis 22, Jehovah Gyra, the Lord will
[1:07:39] provide himself a sacrifice.
[1:07:42] Jehovah Rafa, which is the Lord that
[1:07:44] health. Exodus 15 and 26. Jehovah Nissi,
[1:07:48] the Lord, our banner,
[1:07:50] which is a standard.
[1:07:52] Amen. So, he is our standard. Remember,
[1:07:54] when the enemy comes in like a flood,
[1:07:56] I'll raise up a standard against him.
[1:07:58] Amen.
[1:07:59] Jehovah Shalom, the Lord our peace.
[1:08:02] That's why Jesus could say, "My peace
[1:08:04] that I give you." Why? Because he was
[1:08:06] Jehovah Shalom.
[1:08:08] Amen. He was Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will
[1:08:10] provide himself a sacrifice. He was the
[1:08:11] manifestation of the sacrifice.
[1:08:13] Amen.
[1:08:14] He is our banner. He is, remember, by
[1:08:17] his stripes we were healed.
[1:08:19] So he is Jehovah Rafa, the Lord that
[1:08:21] healthth.
[1:08:22] Amen. The same God. Remember the Old
[1:08:25] Testament and the New? It's all the same
[1:08:27] book.
[1:08:29] Yeah. It's just the same God revealing
[1:08:31] himself all the way down.
[1:08:34] Jehovah Rafa, I mean, no, Jehovah uh
[1:08:36] Rah, the Lord my shepherd.
[1:08:40] Amen.
[1:08:41] And and then Jesus says, "I am the great
[1:08:43] shepherd."
[1:08:44] Yeah. So he is our shepherd
[1:08:47] and then Jehovah uh tiskanu the lord our
[1:08:51] righteousness.
[1:08:53] Amen. And Jesus is our righteousness.
[1:08:57] Yeah. But then you cannot have those
[1:09:00] attributes being displayed unless he is
[1:09:04] Jehovah Shama which is the Lord is
[1:09:06] present.
[1:09:07] Amen.
[1:09:08] Amen. You cannot you cannot know God any
[1:09:12] by any of those other attributes unless
[1:09:14] he's present.
[1:09:14] Amen.
[1:09:15] Amen. So he must be Jehovah Shama.
[1:09:18] Amen.
[1:09:19] He must be present. The Lord is present.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:22] Amen.
[1:09:22] Are you with me?
[1:09:23] Amen. Because now remember Jesus says a
[1:09:26] little while the world seeth me no more.
[1:09:28] The unbelieving world will. But ye shall
[1:09:30] see me.
[1:09:31] Amen.
[1:09:31] Amen. I'll be with you even in you to
[1:09:33] the end of the world. So he promised the
[1:09:36] believer, I'll be with them even in
[1:09:38] them. So he was promising the believer,
[1:09:40] I will be Jehovah Shama to you.
[1:09:42] Amen.
[1:09:43] Amen. I will be the Lord present.
[1:09:45] Amen.
[1:09:46] Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] Now, as I said, so he has to be Jehovah
[1:09:51] Shama. He has to be the Lord is present.
[1:09:54] Amen.
[1:09:55] That's right.
[1:09:56] Now, I want you to put this into your
[1:09:58] own. Remember, I'm talking individually
[1:10:00] to you.
[1:10:01] Yeah. This is not all the church and
[1:10:03] God's in the church. The reason God is
[1:10:05] in the church is because God is in the
[1:10:07] people.
[1:10:08] Amen. If God wasn't in the people, God
[1:10:10] wouldn't be in the church.
[1:10:12] Amen.
[1:10:13] Because remember, this is just a
[1:10:14] location that that the Lord has allowed
[1:10:16] us to have that we can separate to him
[1:10:18] that we can come and worship him at.
[1:10:21] But in but in reality, all this is is
[1:10:24] just a location.
[1:10:25] That's right.
[1:10:26] Amen. That's why we go to camp and God's
[1:10:28] at camp.
[1:10:29] That's why we went our Rancho Chapel.
[1:10:30] God was at the Al Rancho Chapel. That's
[1:10:33] why the Anglican church that Pukaru
[1:10:34] obey, God is there when we're there
[1:10:36] because God is in his people.
[1:10:38] God is present in his people.
[1:10:41] Amen.
[1:10:41] Amen. So all of the compound the seven
[1:10:44] compound redemption redemptive names of
[1:10:46] Jehovah that I just read, they're all in
[1:10:49] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:50] Because even the name Jesus means
[1:10:52] Jehovah's salvation.
[1:10:54] So now remember, they were saved
[1:10:57] physically from Egypt. They were
[1:10:58] delivered physically from Egypt, but
[1:11:01] they were never delivered from their sin
[1:11:03] because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:11:05] just covered up sin.
[1:11:06] Amen. It never actually set the people
[1:11:09] free.
[1:11:11] And that's why it even says in in in
[1:11:13] Revelations chapter 1, if you're still
[1:11:14] there,
[1:11:18] it says this
[1:11:28] in verse 5.
[1:11:31] He says, "And from Jesus Christ, who is
[1:11:34] the faithful witness and the first
[1:11:37] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[1:11:39] the kings of the earth, unto him that
[1:11:41] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[1:11:45] his own blood." And that word,
[1:11:50] I think it's that word washed actually
[1:11:52] means a loosening.
[1:11:55] We're being washed. We're being
[1:11:56] separated from them.
[1:11:58] Amen. They did not know that under the
[1:12:00] blood of bulls and goats.
[1:12:01] They did not know that as when God was
[1:12:04] just Jehovah God.
[1:12:05] But then when Jesus remember the first
[1:12:07] declaration of Jesus' name upon the
[1:12:09] earth when the angel Gabriel announced
[1:12:11] it, he said, "You shall call his name
[1:12:13] Jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:12:16] their sins."
[1:12:18] Amen. So they so he be to so the
[1:12:21] declaration that Jesus was coming. This
[1:12:23] is the reason that God was going to
[1:12:24] manifest himself this way because he
[1:12:26] shall save his people from their sins.
[1:12:29] Amen. So, and that's why. And so, and so
[1:12:32] deliverance from sin is the greatest
[1:12:35] revelation of God.
[1:12:36] Yes. Amen.
[1:12:37] Amen. Because you can be physically
[1:12:39] healed, but then you can get sick again.
[1:12:41] That's right.
[1:12:41] Amen. You can, you know, but it's when
[1:12:44] it's when your sins are washed away.
[1:12:46] Amen.
[1:12:47] Hallelujah.
[1:12:48] Amen. Because by one offering, he has
[1:12:50] perfected them forever that are
[1:12:52] sanctified.
[1:12:53] Amen. So by that one offering, amen,
[1:12:56] that sin burden you were born with and
[1:12:58] was added to by your first nature.
[1:13:01] Amen. By one offering, he said, "I'm
[1:13:03] going to do away with that burden."
[1:13:04] Amen.
[1:13:04] Amen. You don't have to carry those
[1:13:06] things anymore.
[1:13:07] Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] Hallelujah. And he said it's like a tub
[1:13:10] of bleach and you're dropping a put a
[1:13:12] drop of ink into the tub of bleach. It
[1:13:15] says he he said it it goes down. It
[1:13:17] breaks up. And then I don't know how
[1:13:19] this works, but he says, "But then the
[1:13:20] ink becomes bleach."
[1:13:22] Amen. So it breaks up. But then not only
[1:13:25] that is that it's not accounted to you
[1:13:28] anymore, but it goes upon the head of
[1:13:30] the accuser, Satan, because sin has to
[1:13:33] be annihilated.
[1:13:35] Amen. It has to be annihilated. And the
[1:13:37] place it's going to be annihilated is in
[1:13:39] the lake of fire.
[1:13:40] Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] And it has to be attributed to someone
[1:13:44] in order for it to go there.
[1:13:45] Amen. So it all goes back down to Satan.
[1:13:48] It goes on the head of Satan and he
[1:13:49] carries your sin.
[1:13:51] Amen. The thing that he trapped you
[1:13:53] with.
[1:13:54] Hallelujah.
[1:13:55] And he's got to pack that thing down to
[1:13:56] lake of fire and he's got to suffer the
[1:13:59] punishment that you should have taken.
[1:14:01] Hallelujah. However many millions of
[1:14:03] years, I don't know, in a consuming
[1:14:05] fire.
[1:14:06] Lord,
[1:14:06] he's got to pack your what he tried to
[1:14:09] trap you. The thing he tried to put upon
[1:14:11] you to make you stop you going to
[1:14:13] heaven.
[1:14:14] Amen. And it gets transferred by the
[1:14:15] blood of Jesus Christ onto his head.
[1:14:17] Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] Amen.
[1:14:19] Amen. And he's got to pack that down to
[1:14:20] a lake of fire and you go up into glory.
[1:14:24] I think that's a great exchange, don't
[1:14:25] you?
[1:14:27] Hallelujah.
[1:14:28] But now you must understand in in order
[1:14:32] in order for him to be Jehovah Savior,
[1:14:35] he must be Jehovah Shama.
[1:14:37] Amen.
[1:14:38] He must be present.
[1:14:40] Amen.
[1:14:40] Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] And and that's why I said in the
[1:14:45] beginning, in order to receive a
[1:14:47] revelation, he has to be present.
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:52] Hallelujah.
[1:14:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:53] That's why you got to rejoice.
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:55] If something if God has made his word
[1:14:57] alive to you.
[1:14:59] Amen.
[1:14:59] He's quickened. He's quickened his word
[1:15:01] to you.
[1:15:02] Amen.
[1:15:03] And and and you couldn't deny it even if
[1:15:05] you wanted to.
[1:15:07] Amen. You couldn't a believer that
[1:15:10] really knows the Lord,
[1:15:11] they might try and go back into the
[1:15:13] world.
[1:15:14] They could try and go back into some
[1:15:15] dead formal church.
[1:15:17] They never could.
[1:15:18] Amen.
[1:15:18] Amen. Because you cannot deny a part of
[1:15:21] yourself.
[1:15:22] Amen. And when he reveals himself to
[1:15:25] you, he infuses that
[1:15:28] into your being.
[1:15:30] Amen. The word becomes part of you.
[1:15:33] Amen. Because remember, he is his word.
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:36] And it's like the centurion who had the
[1:15:38] sick servant, he had remember the Jews
[1:15:41] whenever like like Jeras with his
[1:15:43] daughter come lay hands upon her that
[1:15:45] she'll get well. That was the Jewish
[1:15:48] belief. But when the centurion who was a
[1:15:50] gentile had a sick servant, he had a
[1:15:52] revelation that he remember because
[1:15:55] Jesus said, "Okay, I'll go pray for you.
[1:15:57] I mean I mean I'll go pray for him." But
[1:15:59] he said, "I'm not worthy you come under
[1:16:00] my roof, but speak the word."
[1:16:03] Amen. and the servant will be well.
[1:16:05] So the centurion had a revelation.
[1:16:08] Remember this is gentile faith. Now
[1:16:10] the centurion had A REVELATION THAT
[1:16:12] GOD'S WORD is exactly the same as him
[1:16:15] being there.
[1:16:16] Amen.
[1:16:17] He Yeah. He did not distinguish this is
[1:16:20] Jesus. This is his word. He knew Jesus
[1:16:23] and his word were one.
[1:16:24] Amen.
[1:16:25] Amen. So he understood all he need to do
[1:16:27] is speak the word and he'd be well.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:30] Amen. him speaking the word there was
[1:16:32] just as good as him stepping in the door
[1:16:34] and laying hands upon a sick servant.
[1:16:37] And God's word is here.
[1:16:39] Amen. So that means Jesus is here right
[1:16:42] now.
[1:16:43] Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:16:45] Everything everything God is is present.
[1:16:47] Amen.
[1:16:48] That's why we hold his word so dear. I
[1:16:51] trust you do
[1:16:52] because it's not only it's not only this
[1:16:54] is God in print form.
[1:16:56] You should treasure this with all your
[1:16:58] heart. But we don't just have the
[1:17:00] written word, but we have the right
[1:17:02] interpretation of the scripture.
[1:17:04] We have the spoken word of God.
[1:17:07] Amen.
[1:17:08] And God speaks his word. And in his word
[1:17:11] is creative power.
[1:17:12] Amen.
[1:17:13] Amen. It has the power to change a
[1:17:16] sinner into a saint.
[1:17:17] And we've seen it. He sent his word
[1:17:19] forth. And people have been changed from
[1:17:21] sinners to saints.
[1:17:23] Amen. People have been changed from lost
[1:17:24] to found.
[1:17:26] Hallelujah. People have been who were
[1:17:28] once in religious harlotry and whatever
[1:17:31] more, they're now being made virgin
[1:17:33] again,
[1:17:34] washed in the blood of the lamb.
[1:17:36] Hallelujah. God just doesn't patch you
[1:17:37] up. HE'S I'M GOING TO MAKE ALL things
[1:17:39] new.
[1:17:40] And he starts in you, [applause]
[1:17:41] friends. He's not just going to make all
[1:17:43] things new in the creation. He starts in
[1:17:45] his bride.
[1:17:46] That's why you never did it in the first
[1:17:48] place.
[1:17:50] Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] Just hold on. Just hold on to these
[1:17:53] things. as the devil comes along, you
[1:17:55] got to you just got to take take God at
[1:17:58] his word.
[1:17:58] That's right.
[1:18:00] God said, "I'm as sinless as he is
[1:18:02] sinless."
[1:18:03] Remember, Jesus became me
[1:18:05] that I might become him by grace.
[1:18:07] Amen.
[1:18:08] Amen.
[1:18:09] It's either true or it's false.
[1:18:11] But it's become quickened to me, so it's
[1:18:13] true.
[1:18:13] Amen.
[1:18:14] Amen. And that's why this Bible is true
[1:18:16] because you read it and the spirit of
[1:18:18] revelation drops into it and it begins
[1:18:20] to manifest what's on the pages. And
[1:18:22] it's the same thing with the message.
[1:18:24] Amen. You hear that word, the Holy
[1:18:26] Spirit comes in behind that word and
[1:18:28] transforms you.
[1:18:30] Hallelujah.
[1:18:31] That's what it does.
[1:18:33] It's what it does. I've seen it too
[1:18:35] much.
[1:18:36] Amen. This is not doctrine. And well, he
[1:18:38] said this and he meant this and whatever
[1:18:39] more and what you know what about the
[1:18:41] serpent seed and all these different
[1:18:42] things. It goes beyond doctrine.
[1:18:44] WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST SIT DOWN for a
[1:18:46] second and look,
[1:18:47] this is what I was and this is what I am
[1:18:49] and this is what changed me.
[1:18:50] Amen. See, we could all stand up and
[1:18:52] say, "This is what I was. This is who I
[1:18:54] am. This is what changed me."
[1:18:56] And it's not enthusiasm. Enthusiasm
[1:18:58] fades. Enthusiasm burns out. This is not
[1:19:01] burning out.
[1:19:02] Hallelujah. This will never burn out.
[1:19:04] How many of you just keep your focus on
[1:19:06] the word? AND EVEN IF YOU GO SIDEWAYS,
[1:19:08] GOD WILL BRING YOU BACK. [applause]
[1:19:10] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:12] OH, I'm lost and undone, God will bring
[1:19:14] you back. I FEEL SO DISCOURAGED. I'M
[1:19:16] GOING TO ENCOURAGE YOU. I'm your guide.
[1:19:18] Hallelujah. David said, "You're the
[1:19:20] strength of my life."
[1:19:21] Amen.
[1:19:21] Psalms 27, that's the rapture message
[1:19:24] right in there.
[1:19:24] Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] Amen. You got to recognize he's the
[1:19:27] strength of you. Always just just look
[1:19:28] to him.
[1:19:30] Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:19:31] finisher of our faith every day. Look to
[1:19:34] him.
[1:19:34] Don't look at this guy cuz you'll be
[1:19:36] disappointed.
[1:19:37] Amen. Look to him
[1:19:39] because in spite of you,
[1:19:41] IN SPITE OF ABRAHAM AND SARAH, Sarah
[1:19:43] doubted for a long time.
[1:19:45] Sarah doubted for 25 years. She doubted
[1:19:48] the promise.
[1:19:49] Amen. But Abraham held on.
[1:19:52] And Abraham knew she was part of the
[1:19:54] promise.
[1:19:56] You may have unbelieving family.
[1:19:59] Disbelieving family.
[1:20:00] You got to just I trust it anchors into
[1:20:02] your soul. God, they're part of your
[1:20:04] promise.
[1:20:05] Amen.
[1:20:06] Amen.
[1:20:07] Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] And then he had a visit. She had a
[1:20:11] visitation.
[1:20:13] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:20:15] And then it says that she judged him
[1:20:17] faithful.
[1:20:19] Amen. Remember, we are even in the
[1:20:21] scripture, we are Sarah as well. The
[1:20:23] church for 2,000 years has been sitting
[1:20:25] there waiting for the return of the
[1:20:26] promised son.
[1:20:28] But just before the sun comes, God is
[1:20:30] manifested in flesh. Amen. To turn to
[1:20:34] turn the unbelief into faith.
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:36] Amen. Because we are a people. Let's go
[1:20:38] to Re uh Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:20:48] now and we'll read verse 11.
[1:20:50] This is your This is you.
[1:20:53] Remember Sarah is a type of you.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah.
[1:20:59] He says this here. Remember that's the
[1:21:01] reason God God in Genesis 18 that
[1:21:04] visitation as I've said was not for
[1:21:06] Abraham. Abraham already believed
[1:21:09] because he says he says and this is God
[1:21:11] in flesh saying according to time of
[1:21:13] life you're going to have the promised
[1:21:14] son a time of life speaks of a woman
[1:21:17] doesn't speak of the man.
[1:21:19] Amen.
[1:21:20] So this was Sarah's visitation.
[1:21:23] Amen.
[1:21:24] Yeah. And so after this now
[1:21:28] after this Sarah's Sarah's report was
[1:21:31] through faith also Sarah herself
[1:21:34] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:21:37] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:21:40] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:21:43] who had promised.
[1:21:45] Amen.
[1:21:45] Amen.
[1:21:46] Remember God God has to be present to
[1:21:50] reveal himself. Amen.
[1:21:51] And so God was present on the plains of
[1:21:53] memory to reveal this to Sarah.
[1:21:55] And her her she turned from unbelief to
[1:21:58] faith when she actually now begin to
[1:22:00] judge him faithful
[1:22:02] that judge him faithful who had
[1:22:04] promised.
[1:22:06] Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] Amen.
[1:22:07] Amen.
[1:22:08] And we have come to an age where the
[1:22:10] bride of Christ judges him faithful.
[1:22:13] Amen. Because this is the age where the
[1:22:15] world is falling apart.
[1:22:16] Amen.
[1:22:17] Amen. and everything. We're living in a
[1:22:19] post-Christian era.
[1:22:20] Amen.
[1:22:21] I don't know if you've come to that
[1:22:22] realization. We're living in a
[1:22:24] post-Christian era.
[1:22:25] That's right.
[1:22:26] And people are trying to, oh, we're
[1:22:27] going to Christianize the West again.
[1:22:30] It's not It It's not in scripture.
[1:22:33] But there is ones and twos.
[1:22:35] Amen. There are still lost lambs
[1:22:37] floating around in darkness.
[1:22:39] We were I was floating around in
[1:22:40] darkness.
[1:22:41] Amen.
[1:22:41] Hallelujah. God found me.
[1:22:44] God found you. Amen.
[1:22:45] There's got to be more than just us in
[1:22:47] these four walls.
[1:22:48] Amen.
[1:22:49] Amen. That's part of the reason why
[1:22:50] we're going upstairs because we don't
[1:22:52] have any more room.
[1:22:54] Amen. There's there's more. And if we
[1:22:56] need to move somewhere else, God will
[1:22:58] move us.
[1:22:58] Amen. That's right.
[1:22:59] Amen. But we got to have it in our
[1:23:01] hearts. There's got to be more, Lord.
[1:23:03] There's got to be more.
[1:23:05] Hallelujah. Because a mission-minded
[1:23:07] church, God always blesses.
[1:23:09] Amen.
[1:23:09] Yeah. God never blesses an ask for and
[1:23:12] no more kind of people.
[1:23:14] Amen. So if we want to be blessed as a
[1:23:16] people,
[1:23:17] we got to we got to have our heart. Even
[1:23:18] even if you just pray
[1:23:21] because I've been feeling quite strongly
[1:23:23] recently, we need to pray expressly
[1:23:27] that the people who need to be free, God
[1:23:30] breaks those chains.
[1:23:32] Because we know people,
[1:23:34] they want to they want to come,
[1:23:37] but they're still bound into the old
[1:23:39] systems of man,
[1:23:40] but there's something in them that wants
[1:23:42] to come free. It's a spiritual battle.
[1:23:45] It is.
[1:23:46] Amen. So we especially this Wednesday or
[1:23:48] start praying about now pray expressly
[1:23:50] God break the chains of the people who
[1:23:53] want to come free.
[1:23:54] Amen.
[1:23:55] Amen.
[1:23:55] Amen. Cuz that's why people are torn.
[1:23:57] Well, I want to stay here but I should
[1:23:58] stay here but I want to come and I know
[1:24:00] you've got something more and you know
[1:24:02] God seems to be real with you and I want
[1:24:04] what you have but I but but but I want
[1:24:05] to stay here.
[1:24:07] Why? It's because the devil's saying I
[1:24:09] will not let you go.
[1:24:11] Amen.
[1:24:12] Amen. So we need to pray expressly.
[1:24:15] Amen.
[1:24:16] That God breaks the chains.
[1:24:18] Amen.
[1:24:19] Because this is a spiritual battle.
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:24] It's not like the devil, you know, I
[1:24:26] remember when I first came into a
[1:24:28] message church. I was in a Pentecostal
[1:24:30] church before that just for a little
[1:24:31] bit. There were no doubts in my mind.
[1:24:33] Then I come in, sit in the pews there,
[1:24:36] truth is being preached. All these
[1:24:38] distractions in my mind, all these
[1:24:39] doubts and all these things come in.
[1:24:41] Why? Because the truth is here.
[1:24:43] It was back there as well. Wherever the
[1:24:45] word, wherever the truth is, the devil's
[1:24:47] there to try and disrupt you. And a kid
[1:24:49] falls off a seat and no one's seen a kid
[1:24:50] fall off a seat before. And oh, this
[1:24:52] kid's crying and oh, I've never seen a
[1:24:54] kid cry before. He tries to distract.
[1:24:57] Amen. Because the truth is there.
[1:25:00] But you got to understand, of course,
[1:25:01] that's going to happen.
[1:25:03] Don't be surprised. You know, sometimes
[1:25:05] people go, "Oh, am I even a believer?"
[1:25:07] Yes, you're a believer.
[1:25:08] Amen. If you didn't have the doubts and
[1:25:10] the questions and all the things trying
[1:25:11] to distract you,
[1:25:13] I say, "Well, you should be more worried
[1:25:15] about that."
[1:25:16] Amen. Because Because remember, there's
[1:25:19] only a battle when the opponent's trying
[1:25:21] to thinks he can get control again.
[1:25:24] Hallelujah.
[1:25:26] Hallelujah.
[1:25:28] Amen. But if you're on his side, if he's
[1:25:30] got you,
[1:25:31] Yep. Let them go.
[1:25:32] They're fine. They can do whatever they
[1:25:33] want,
[1:25:34] right?
[1:25:35] Amen. That that's why there's about Oh,
[1:25:36] that that's not really true. Oh, he's
[1:25:38] just putting too much emphasis on this
[1:25:39] and oh, he's just putting a wrong angle
[1:25:41] on this kind of thing. That's why he's
[1:25:42] saying this. Oh, it's just his
[1:25:43] personality saying this and you know
[1:25:45] what's that? That's the devil.
[1:25:47] Amen.
[1:25:48] Amen.
[1:25:48] It is.
[1:25:49] Just take the word for what it is.
[1:25:51] Amen.
[1:25:52] Amen.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] You know,
[1:25:56] now he has to be present to give you
[1:25:59] revelation.
[1:26:01] Yep.
[1:26:02] Romans 10:6. Let's go here.
[1:26:27] Now,
[1:26:33] for the righteousness which is of faith
[1:26:36] speaketh on this wise. Okay.
[1:26:40] Say not thine heart, who shall ascend
[1:26:43] into heaven? That is bring uh that is to
[1:26:47] bring Christ down from above. Or who
[1:26:50] shall descend into the deep? That is to
[1:26:52] bring Christ up again from the dead.
[1:26:55] Righteousness doesn't speak this way.
[1:26:58] Yeah. But what saith it? The word is
[1:27:01] nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in
[1:27:03] thine heart. That is the word of faith
[1:27:06] which we preach.
[1:27:08] Yeah. So Paul is saying here, remember
[1:27:13] this is what unbelief says. We need to
[1:27:16] go get Jesus somewhere.
[1:27:18] Yeah.
[1:27:19] We need to go get him from heaven. We
[1:27:22] need to call him down
[1:27:23] or we need to get him up cuz he's still
[1:27:25] in the tomb.
[1:27:26] This is unbelief.
[1:27:28] What is unbelief saying? Jesus is
[1:27:30] somewhere else.
[1:27:32] Amen. Oh, he's coming again.
[1:27:34] We're looking forward to him to come
[1:27:36] in the meeting of the year. We are, but
[1:27:38] he's already here.
[1:27:39] Amen.
[1:27:40] I'm just reading this from the scripture
[1:27:41] saying,
[1:27:42] "But righteousness which is of faith
[1:27:44] speaketh on this wise."
[1:27:47] Remember Abraham believed God and it was
[1:27:49] accounted to him for righteousness.
[1:27:52] Amen. Because he believed, it was
[1:27:54] accounted to him for righteousness.
[1:27:56] What? The thief on the cross believed
[1:27:58] God.
[1:27:59] Yes.
[1:28:00] And it was accounted to him for
[1:28:01] righteousness.
[1:28:03] Mhm. Cuz he said, "Lord, remember me
[1:28:04] when you come into thy kingdom."
[1:28:06] No one said no one preached him a
[1:28:08] sermon.
[1:28:09] He didn't read any website or hear some
[1:28:11] sermon or go to some church. He saw his
[1:28:14] he saw Jehovah Gyrus God will provide
[1:28:16] himself a sacrifice. He saw the
[1:28:18] sacrifice hanging right next to him.
[1:28:20] Amen.
[1:28:21] Amen. And he recognized now this one
[1:28:24] this one was going to go up into his
[1:28:26] kingdom
[1:28:26] and empty out paradise
[1:28:29] and deliver people from the chains of
[1:28:30] darkness.
[1:28:31] Amen. And he believed God
[1:28:34] and it was accounted him for
[1:28:35] righteousness.
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:38] How do I become righteous? Believe his
[1:28:40] word.
[1:28:41] Amen. Believe his word and then
[1:28:44] everything else will fall into place.
[1:28:47] You don't you don't patch up the
[1:28:48] outside. Just believe his word.
[1:28:51] You believe his word and then the
[1:28:52] outside will come right.
[1:28:54] Then the house will be changed. Then
[1:28:55] your relationship will be different with
[1:28:56] your spouse. Just believe the word.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:28:59] Amen.
[1:29:00] That's all you have to do. Yeah.
[1:29:02] Believe the word and then watch
[1:29:03] everything else fall into place.
[1:29:05] Because when you believe God now, God
[1:29:08] has to back up what he said to you and
[1:29:10] do what he promised.
[1:29:11] Amen.
[1:29:12] Amen.
[1:29:13] All you have to do is believe it.
[1:29:14] Amen.
[1:29:16] Now,
[1:29:18] so but righteous of faith speaketh on
[1:29:20] this wise, saying not say not in thine
[1:29:22] heart. So don't say subconsciously, who
[1:29:25] shall ascend into heaven, that is to
[1:29:26] bring Christ down from above? or who who
[1:29:29] shall descend into the deep that is to
[1:29:30] bring Christ up from the dead. But what
[1:29:32] saith it? Now remember Christ remember
[1:29:35] he is his word.
[1:29:37] Yep. He is his word.
[1:29:39] But what sayith it? The word is nigh
[1:29:41] thee. It's close to you even in thy
[1:29:44] mouth and in thy heart. That is the word
[1:29:46] of faith which we preach.
[1:29:48] So Paul is saying that God is present.
[1:29:51] Amen.
[1:29:52] You following me? He is actually
[1:29:54] declaring this is this [laughter] is the
[1:29:55] righteousness of faith. Faith says God
[1:29:58] is present.
[1:29:59] Faith says that word is neither even in
[1:30:02] thy mouth even in thy heart.
[1:30:04] Amen.
[1:30:04] Amen. Remember the word is not just
[1:30:07] this is just a printed form of of words.
[1:30:11] Amen. But he's not talking about mental
[1:30:13] retention of a word.
[1:30:15] Even though you must it's good to have
[1:30:17] memory verses and read the Bible. Amen.
[1:30:20] Because it goes the word goes from here
[1:30:22] into here.
[1:30:23] Amen. If you don't give anything God to
[1:30:26] work with,
[1:30:27] then how's he going to work?
[1:30:29] Amen.
[1:30:30] It's very very ABC simple.
[1:30:33] You know, that's why that's why the
[1:30:36] devil makes your life very busy.
[1:30:39] Amen.
[1:30:39] I'm just going to look at Facebook and
[1:30:41] there goes 40 minutes.
[1:30:43] I'm just going to read the news. There
[1:30:44] goes another 40 minutes
[1:30:46] now. I'm just going to go to bed.
[1:30:50] How about this?
[1:30:50] God have mercy. Take the time you spend
[1:30:53] on Facebook,
[1:30:54] spend it in the word first and then go
[1:30:56] into Facebook.
[1:30:58] Amen.
[1:30:59] Try that out.
[1:31:01] But I want to know what's going on in
[1:31:02] the world.
[1:31:05] This is the newspaper.
[1:31:07] You just get into that message. The
[1:31:08] thing I've said it many times, the thing
[1:31:10] that things that brother Brham said,
[1:31:13] we are seeing manifested upon the earth.
[1:31:15] Amen.
[1:31:16] Amen. when the last vision he had was
[1:31:18] America all smoke bombs and craters and
[1:31:21] look what's happening in the world.
[1:31:23] Russia's awakened.
[1:31:25] Yeah.
[1:31:25] Amen. They're preparing themselves for
[1:31:27] war and America's playing Pokémon Go.
[1:31:30] Yeah.
[1:31:32] Amen.
[1:31:33] It's going to be It's been prophesied to
[1:31:35] happen.
[1:31:36] He said the Revelations 18 about the
[1:31:38] bomb being dropped on the Vatican,
[1:31:41] Russia's going to do it.
[1:31:43] Amen. They're coming into their
[1:31:45] position. Yeah,
[1:31:46] we have the technology and the egg. Have
[1:31:49] you ever Googled cars in 1933?
[1:31:54] They are these big box things.
[1:31:56] They didn't care about aerodynamics.
[1:31:58] They just probably thought, "Well, that
[1:31:59] looks cool. We'll build it that way."
[1:32:01] Go Google cars in 1933.
[1:32:03] And that is the same year when brother
[1:32:05] saw eggshaped cars.
[1:32:08] And there's a and there's there's no
[1:32:09] steering wheel and there's like a family
[1:32:11] in there playing a game and it's just
[1:32:13] driving down the motorway.
[1:32:16] We have the technology.
[1:32:18] We have the cars.
[1:32:19] Yeah, right.
[1:32:20] Amen.
[1:32:21] Amen.
[1:32:21] It's all here. He saw it back then.
[1:32:24] And if that is true and he saw, he says,
[1:32:27] "Now I see woman rise in America."
[1:32:31] And and one will rise, beautiful, but
[1:32:34] very cruel. He says, "I'll be a
[1:32:36] president or the Catholic Church." The
[1:32:39] Catholic Church is already in control in
[1:32:41] America.
[1:32:41] That's exactly right. Most all of the
[1:32:44] Supreme Court judges now the Supreme
[1:32:46] Court in America, they are there for
[1:32:48] life when they're voted in
[1:32:50] and that's the highest authority in in
[1:32:52] the country.
[1:32:53] They're all Catholics and Jews. There's
[1:32:55] no Protestant Supreme Court judges
[1:32:56] anymore.
[1:32:58] Amen.
[1:32:59] Most of the you'll see the political
[1:33:00] parties, especially the last election,
[1:33:03] both of the vice president choices were
[1:33:05] Catholic.
[1:33:07] Amen. They're they're all in there. the
[1:33:08] Pope comes in and addresses the Senate
[1:33:11] and everything. And one article I read
[1:33:13] about it was uh they were saying he's
[1:33:16] probably the most like the best
[1:33:18] politician oral statesman in the whole
[1:33:19] room.
[1:33:21] Amen.
[1:33:22] And here he is. And this is what you
[1:33:24] know puts forth his agenda.
[1:33:26] And says in that same trip that that the
[1:33:29] cross was a failure.
[1:33:31] Amen.
[1:33:33] All these things are happening and
[1:33:35] brother said the Catholic Church will
[1:33:37] rise and in 1933 the Catholic Church was
[1:33:40] not on the rise in America.
[1:33:42] Amen. They never would invite the pope
[1:33:44] to the White House.
[1:33:45] That's right.
[1:33:46] They never did those things back then.
[1:33:48] But it wasn't it's not that far down the
[1:33:50] road when this last pope died and
[1:33:53] there's all the former presidents there.
[1:33:55] George Bush senior junior Clinton I
[1:33:57] think another one there and they're
[1:33:58] praying. There's a picture. There's Pope
[1:34:00] John Paul's body there in in in St.
[1:34:02] Peter's. They're on the front row there,
[1:34:04] and they're bowing down, praying before
[1:34:06] this dead body,
[1:34:08] paying homage to this great man.
[1:34:12] The prophet saw it
[1:34:14] and it's here.
[1:34:16] That's right.
[1:34:17] Amen. Don't take these things for
[1:34:19] granted. Don't let it Don't be numb.
[1:34:20] That's right.
[1:34:21] To where we are.
[1:34:22] That's right.
[1:34:23] Amen. Because it's the most glorious
[1:34:25] time to be alive. Because before the
[1:34:28] first bomb falls, the brides in glory.
[1:34:31] Amen.
[1:34:32] Hallelujah.
[1:34:34] But that also and I want to put this
[1:34:36] burden upon you.
[1:34:38] We have to find the last one.
[1:34:40] Amen.
[1:34:41] Amen. Because the door is shutting to
[1:34:43] the Gentiles.
[1:34:45] Amen.
[1:34:46] Amen.
[1:34:46] So, and I said, we say, I don't know how
[1:34:48] to witness. Your life will live.
[1:34:50] That's right.
[1:34:51] But pray above all things.
[1:34:54] Amen. because it's the powerhouse of
[1:34:56] prayer
[1:34:57] where why do we have such a blessed
[1:34:59] time?
[1:35:00] I could be standing here tripping around
[1:35:02] saying all kinds of things.
[1:35:04] Amen. But God is present. Why why does
[1:35:07] why has God blessed us? Why does he
[1:35:09] continue to bless us? Because we pray.
[1:35:12] Amen.
[1:35:12] Amen. Why Why can we rejoice in the
[1:35:15] Lord? Because prayer changes things.
[1:35:18] You understand? That's why the I'm so
[1:35:20] happy we have the prayer meeting. We
[1:35:21] have the We have a church prayer meeting
[1:35:23] now.
[1:35:24] I love it.

[1:35:27] it, too.
[1:35:27] Amen.
[1:35:28] Amen. But that's why I'm so happy we

[1:35:32] things.

[1:35:36] And Yeah. Amen. So, we have to we have
[1:35:40] to find there's coming a day where we

[1:35:46] Amen.
[1:35:48] And we have we can't just let this world
[1:35:51] wants to numb us to that fact.
[1:35:53] Oh, it'll be maybe I don't know when
[1:35:55] it'll be. It could be right now.
[1:35:57] Amen.
[1:35:57] I'd still be happy.
[1:35:58] Amen.
[1:35:59] But let's labor.
[1:36:01] Remember, we do not earn we do not earn
[1:36:03] salvation.
[1:36:05] But when we see him, I want to hear
[1:36:08] those words, you good and faithful
[1:36:09] servant.
[1:36:11] Amen. Enter into the joy of the Lord's.
[1:36:12] Yeah.
[1:36:13] You want to be good and faithful in what
[1:36:15] God has committed you to do.
[1:36:17] That's right.
[1:36:17] Amen.
[1:36:18] But we don't want to go up empty-handed.
[1:36:22] Yeah.
[1:36:23] I'm not talking about me. I'm talking
[1:36:24] about all of us. We want to, you know, I
[1:36:25] want to say, "Lord, I ran this race with
[1:36:28] everything I had."
[1:36:29] Amen.
[1:36:30] Remember, he enables you to do it cuz
[1:36:32] race enables you to live the word.
[1:36:34] Amen.
[1:36:35] But we want to run this race victorious.
[1:36:39] Amen.
[1:36:39] Yeah.
[1:36:40] Amen.
[1:36:40] Amen. And even if the thing is
[1:36:44] don't look at well no one's listening to
[1:36:46] me
[1:36:48] remember who who does anyone love
[1:36:51] fishing here
[1:36:52] like really or hunting
[1:36:55] now [laughter]
[1:36:57] if you don't shoot something do you
[1:36:59] throw your gun away and say I'm never
[1:37:01] going hunting again
[1:37:02] they say next time.
[1:37:05] Yeah. And if you know there's only say
[1:37:07] one deer or one whatever you say I'm
[1:37:09] going to get that one. Amen.
[1:37:11] Right.
[1:37:11] Yeah.
[1:37:12] And it's the same thing when it comes to
[1:37:14] finding souls. There may be less,
[1:37:18] but they're still there.
[1:37:20] Amen. I didn't get them. Well, I'm going
[1:37:22] to get him.
[1:37:23] You know how there's like those old
[1:37:24] stories of there's that big fish and
[1:37:26] that guy's been trying to catch it all
[1:37:27] those years.
[1:37:28] You heard those kind of stories?
[1:37:30] He doesn't. That guy doesn't get
[1:37:31] discouraged. I'm going to catch old
[1:37:33] yeller or whatever his name is. Big
[1:37:35] Bill, you know, I'm going to get him.
[1:37:38] and their whole life becomes focused.
[1:37:41] They may work, they may do all kinds of
[1:37:42] things, but but it becomes an obsession.
[1:37:44] You're like, you're like the book, was
[1:37:46] it uh was it Moby Dick? I want to get
[1:37:48] that white whale, you know, the you know
[1:37:50] the captain, whatever his name, he
[1:37:52] becomes an obsession.
[1:37:54] Amen.
[1:37:54] Amen.
[1:37:56] What about us
[1:37:58] finding souls?
[1:38:00] Amen. Remember, we're not building a
[1:38:02] kingdom,
[1:38:03] just an oh, a church.
[1:38:05] We're not I'm not Forget that. We're
[1:38:08] here to find the last one.
[1:38:09] Amen.
[1:38:10] Amen.
[1:38:10] Amen.
[1:38:11] And even if you hear about mission work
[1:38:14] overseas and you pray for that, the
[1:38:16] success of that mission work be is
[1:38:18] because you're anointed to pray. And it
[1:38:21] doesn't matter if you never they never
[1:38:24] know until the other side.
[1:38:26] Amen. But we got to we got to whenever
[1:38:28] we hear about God's doing something, we
[1:38:30] should throw every shoulder behind the
[1:38:32] wheel we can.
[1:38:33] Amen.
[1:38:33] And pray for it earnestly.
[1:38:35] Amen. Because remember this is a body
[1:38:37] work.
[1:38:38] Amen.
[1:38:38] It's not a church work or individual
[1:38:41] work or you know we're all in this
[1:38:44] together.
[1:38:44] Amen.
[1:38:45] With our with our brothers and sisters.
[1:38:46] Doesn't matter what country or what
[1:38:48] nationality, what language. That's
[1:38:49] right.
[1:38:50] We're with them.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:52] Amen.
[1:38:52] Amen.
[1:38:54] That's why we should always pray.
[1:38:55] Amen.
[1:38:56] Now,
[1:38:58] [snorts]
[1:39:00] he is present.
[1:39:03] I just want to read this.
[1:39:05] I'm sorry, my time has slipped away.
[1:39:10] But now
[1:39:12] Jesus promised
[1:39:14] that he'd be with us even in us to the
[1:39:16] end of the world. Now we're not going to
[1:39:19] read it, but I'm just going to cover
[1:39:20] this very quickly. You go read
[1:39:21] Revelations chapter 10.
[1:39:23] And it says, "And the mighty angel
[1:39:25] descended from heaven with a rainbow
[1:39:27] over his head and open book in his
[1:39:29] hand." Amen. That is Christ coming down
[1:39:33] to the earth.
[1:39:34] Not in a physical body. Remember, we we
[1:39:36] meet the Lord in the air.
[1:39:38] But that is part of his coming.
[1:39:41] Amen. It's like are you you know it's
[1:39:43] like the tide coming in.
[1:39:45] The tide. It takes a process of time for
[1:39:48] the tide to come in, but then it's in.
[1:39:50] Yeah. But it doesn't just Oh, now
[1:39:51] there's high tide. It's the same thing
[1:39:53] with the coming of the Lord.
[1:39:55] He starts his coming and and his coming
[1:39:58] begins. He places a prophet upon the
[1:39:59] earth. Because if you read the breach,
[1:40:01] brother A Bram says the seventh angel
[1:40:03] speak of himself. He he he just reads
[1:40:05] Revelations chapter 10 and he says the
[1:40:07] seventh angel is on the earth at the
[1:40:09] time of this coming. Revelations 10:1.
[1:40:11] That's right.
[1:40:12] Amen. That's what he says. And so
[1:40:15] that began the coming of the Lord there
[1:40:18] because there was an Elijah to introduce
[1:40:20] Christ to the bride.
[1:40:21] Yes.
[1:40:22] Amen. And then that's why you always,
[1:40:25] it's so significant to me when he's
[1:40:27] standing there behind the pulpit and he
[1:40:29] calls someone out in the audience and he
[1:40:31] just poses the question, who did he
[1:40:33] touch? Who did she touch?
[1:40:35] And he says he says like they were 20
[1:40:38] feet or whatever feet away from me. He
[1:40:40] said they didn't touch me, they touched
[1:40:42] the high priest.
[1:40:44] Well, then why is why is the man
[1:40:46] standing here revealing what's going on
[1:40:47] in their life? Is because that high
[1:40:49] priest has now stepped into that body.
[1:40:52] Amen. And by faith, they touched the
[1:40:54] high priest and then they re God, the
[1:40:57] high priest in him reveals what's going
[1:40:59] on.
[1:41:00] You understand? So the high priest they
[1:41:02] were touching by faith wasn't up in
[1:41:05] glory. He was down there on the
[1:41:06] platform.
[1:41:08] I trust you catch the significance of
[1:41:10] that.
[1:41:10] Amen.
[1:41:10] So all that Jesus, remember Jesus, the
[1:41:13] fullness of the Godhead bodily was in
[1:41:14] Jesus.
[1:41:15] Everything God is was poured into
[1:41:17] Christ.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:18] Yep. And then everything Christ is, God
[1:41:21] pours into the church.
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:24] Amen. And you see it on the day of
[1:41:26] Pentecost,
[1:41:27] pillar of fire comes down. Jesus in a
[1:41:30] different form comes down, separates
[1:41:32] himself into the believers.
[1:41:34] So everything that was poured, remember
[1:41:35] Jesus when he was baptized, the spirit
[1:41:37] of God descends upon him like a dove.
[1:41:39] The angel of the covenant comes to his
[1:41:41] temple. Malachi 3.
[1:41:43] Amen. And then Jesus does his earthly
[1:41:45] ministry, redeems you and I on Calvary,
[1:41:47] ascends from the grave with the keys of
[1:41:50] hell, death, and the grave in his hand.
[1:41:52] Hallelujah. That's why Paul could say,
[1:41:54] "Death, where is your sting? Grave,
[1:41:56] where is your victory?"
[1:41:58] Remember, death only takes us to where
[1:41:59] we want to go.
[1:42:01] Think about it that way.
[1:42:03] Hallelujah.
[1:42:04] And so now, so now all that God poured
[1:42:07] into Christ, the man, Amen. Now that is
[1:42:11] poured into the church in Acts two.
[1:42:14] Hallelujah.
[1:42:15] Amen.
[1:42:16] All brother makes a statement many
[1:42:18] times. All that God poured into Christ,
[1:42:21] Christ is now poured into the church.
[1:42:23] Amen.
[1:42:24] Amen. So now when we talk about Jehovah
[1:42:27] Shama, God being present, Jehovah Rafa,
[1:42:30] God is our healer or God was it Jehovah
[1:42:33] Nissi, our banner. All those seven
[1:42:34] redemption names, seven compound
[1:42:37] redemptive names of Jehovah,
[1:42:38] Amen,
[1:42:39] is now poured into you.
[1:42:42] Amen. I'm trying to get you to see God
[1:42:45] isn't just in heaven, he's in you.
[1:42:47] That's right.
[1:42:47] Amen.
[1:42:48] Amen. God has put on flesh.
[1:42:51] Hallelujah.
[1:42:53] And what we do now, like Jesus, why did
[1:42:55] he go away and pray? Cuz he wanted to
[1:42:57] stay in fellowship with the God that was
[1:42:59] in him.
[1:42:59] Amen.
[1:43:00] You understand?
[1:43:01] And that's why we stay in prayer. and
[1:43:04] stay in the word because we want to stay
[1:43:05] in fellowship with the God that's in us.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. Because if you stay in
[1:43:10] fellowship with the God that's in you,
[1:43:12] then you can do his will.
[1:43:15] Remember, there is therefore no
[1:43:16] condemnation. Romans 8:1 to them that
[1:43:19] walk after the spirit and not after the
[1:43:21] flesh.
[1:43:22] Amen.
[1:43:23] Amen. Because if you walk according to
[1:43:25] your flesh, you'll get condemnation
[1:43:27] because you will stumble and fall and
[1:43:29] fail and the devil will drag you through
[1:43:30] the mud all he can. But if you walk
[1:43:33] according to the spirit that's within
[1:43:34] you,
[1:43:36] then there's no condemnation because you
[1:43:37] walk victorious.
[1:43:39] Amen.
[1:43:40] And that's why there's always the battle
[1:43:43] who
[1:43:45] who remember when the pressure comes on,
[1:43:48] why does pressure come on? Cuz the devil
[1:43:50] wants to put you back into your carnal
[1:43:51] way.
[1:43:53] Amen.
[1:43:55] Cuz this body is not redeemed.
[1:43:58] Amen. This body needs a body change.
[1:44:02] Please, Lord, now.
[1:44:03] Amen.
[1:44:04] Amen. That's why we're there's something
[1:44:07] groaning within us.
[1:44:08] Amen.
[1:44:08] Lord, I want to put on that new body.
[1:44:10] I want to be closer to you than I am
[1:44:12] right now. I don't want these five
[1:44:14] senses. I don't want that veil between
[1:44:16] you and I.
[1:44:17] Amen.
[1:44:18] Amen. That's why we have a longing for
[1:44:20] the rapture. Not just to escape this
[1:44:21] world. We want to be.
[1:44:23] Remember, he's with us even in us. But
[1:44:25] there's still this thing. Remember Jesus
[1:44:28] Jesus said, you go read it in John how
[1:44:32] how how he's there by the temple and
[1:44:33] they think he's talking about the temple
[1:44:34] but he says he says destroy this temple.
[1:44:37] And in three days I'll raise it back up
[1:44:39] again.
[1:44:40] And that word destroy actually means
[1:44:41] loose.
[1:44:42] Amen.
[1:44:43] Amen. So he says he says he's basically
[1:44:44] saying loose me from this temple.
[1:44:47] Amen. Jesus the joy that was set before
[1:44:49] him
[1:44:50] was being in you.
[1:44:51] Amen.
[1:44:52] Not just with his people. I want to be
[1:44:54] in them.
[1:44:55] That's what he's always longed. He wants
[1:44:56] to be back in the human soul again.
[1:44:58] Hallelujah.
[1:44:59] Hallelujah.
[1:44:59] That's why he's based saying, "Loose me
[1:45:00] from this temple."
[1:45:02] That's why he said to Judas, "Whatever
[1:45:03] you do, do it quickly.
[1:45:05] I want this done."
[1:45:06] Hallelujah.
[1:45:07] Amen.
[1:45:08] Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] Glory to God.
[1:45:10] So now, Revelations
[1:45:12] chapter 10, Christ comes down with an
[1:45:16] open book. Brother makes a statement. He
[1:45:19] says Christ is those seals.
[1:45:22] Amen. And he and so he says he says that
[1:45:24] the opening of the seals is revealing
[1:45:26] Christ.
[1:45:28] Amen.
[1:45:28] So he so he's not saying he's not
[1:45:30] because remember well this is me. The
[1:45:32] first time I listened to the seals I saw
[1:45:34] the horse riders and the tribulation and
[1:45:36] whatever more. But the next time when I
[1:45:39] listened to it I just saw the
[1:45:41] lambstepping forth.
[1:45:42] Here's my redeemer now.
[1:45:44] The whole picture was changed.
[1:45:46] Amen. You see, because by him releasing
[1:45:48] the seals, he's actually releasing part
[1:45:51] of himself. You know, he's revealing
[1:45:53] himself.
[1:45:54] Amen. He's not he's not veiled in in the
[1:45:56] creed and dogmas of man.
[1:45:59] Amen.
[1:46:00] He's he's not veiled behind. Remember,
[1:46:01] it's the unveiling.
[1:46:04] God actually pulls the cover off
[1:46:06] himself.
[1:46:07] And say, "Here I am. This is me."
[1:46:10] Amen. And that's why
[1:46:13] that's why
[1:46:14] Hallelujah. That's why John, remember
[1:46:16] the first chapter you read it, John is
[1:46:18] there and he heard hears a voice like a
[1:46:20] trumpet behind him
[1:46:22] and he turns around and he sees the
[1:46:24] candlesticks and one like the son of man
[1:46:27] walking among the candlesticks and it's
[1:46:29] showing in time as the bride he's
[1:46:32] advanced past the seven church ages.
[1:46:34] Amen.
[1:46:35] And then now he turns and now comes the
[1:46:38] revealing the revelation of Jesus
[1:46:41] Christ.
[1:46:42] Amen.
[1:46:42] You understand? Because brother Ram
[1:46:44] says, "One man in a vision is a
[1:46:47] representation of a whole people." And
[1:46:49] you see that in Revelations 4:1 where
[1:46:51] John sees a that same voice speaks from
[1:46:53] heaven with an open door saying, "Come
[1:46:54] up hither."
[1:46:55] And that's showing at the end of the
[1:46:57] seventh church age is the rapture.
[1:46:59] Amen. Because the bride John is a symbol
[1:47:02] in the book.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:03] You understand? So now there's been
[1:47:05] seven church ages, but the book's
[1:47:07] sealed.
[1:47:09] And here's the bride at the end of the
[1:47:10] seventh church age. And he and she hears
[1:47:14] a voice.
[1:47:14] Hallelujah.
[1:47:15] Turns around
[1:47:16] and sees what God has been doing in
[1:47:18] seven church ages.
[1:47:19] Amen.
[1:47:20] Amen. But not only that, now he says,
[1:47:22] "Now I'm going to show you eternal
[1:47:23] things."
[1:47:24] That's why after the seals, you have a
[1:47:26] prophet stand. You know, brother B stand
[1:47:28] in Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[1:47:30] Says, I'm going to tell you what was in
[1:47:31] the back part of God's mind.
[1:47:34] Amen.
[1:47:35] Hallelujah.
[1:47:35] Take these things are significant.
[1:47:38] Amen. Now, I'm going to tell you what
[1:47:39] the hidden mystery was in him. Amen.
[1:47:42] Amen.
[1:47:43] And so at the end of the church ages
[1:47:45] now, now is the time for the revealing
[1:47:49] of Jesus Christ as supreme deity.
[1:47:51] Amen.
[1:47:52] Amen. That's why he says, look, because
[1:47:54] he says the cloud picture, supreme
[1:47:56] judge,
[1:47:58] supreme deity.
[1:47:59] You see, it just vindicates the message
[1:48:01] perfectly.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:02] Because this message, you know, people
[1:48:03] say, "Oh, it's a prophet." Whatever more
[1:48:05] he exalted Jesus Christ. I am.
[1:48:08] He didn't say he's the second person of
[1:48:10] a godhead. He says he is the almighty,
[1:48:13] the supreme deity. And it even says in
[1:48:15] the book of Revelation in there, chapter
[1:48:17] one, I am Alpha and Omega, the Almighty.
[1:48:20] Hallelujah. Not just a a mighty one, the
[1:48:23] Almighty.
[1:48:24] Amen. The beginning and the ending.
[1:48:26] And now you're living in a season where
[1:48:28] I'm going to take the veil off of me.
[1:48:30] Amen. So you can know me exactly as I
[1:48:32] am.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah. Glorious.
[1:48:36] And the reason this has happened is
[1:48:38] because God wants to show you I am
[1:48:41] Jehovah
[1:48:41] Shama.
[1:48:42] I am God present.
[1:48:45] Hallelujah. So now when when he descends
[1:48:48] there Revelation chapter 8 that is GOD
[1:48:51] ALL THAT GOD IS. I say all that heaven
[1:48:54] is.
[1:48:55] Remember because John was about to write
[1:48:58] he said seal it up.
[1:49:00] So there's a portion of the word that
[1:49:02] was sealed up until the time of the end.
[1:49:04] Amen. And that's why before the seals
[1:49:06] open, Brother Bram's in a meeting and a
[1:49:09] guy, I think Danny Henry, he comes to
[1:49:10] him, a Baptist guy, and he says,
[1:49:12] "Brother Bram, I don't want to sound
[1:49:13] sacriiggious, but that could almost be
[1:49:16] the an extra chapter on the end of the
[1:49:18] book of Revelation." They start speaking
[1:49:20] in tongues in French. And there's a, you
[1:49:23] know, like three French speakers there
[1:49:25] in the in the meeting. Two actually
[1:49:27] wrote it down
[1:49:28] and their notes were exactly was the
[1:49:30] interpretation. And then the French
[1:49:32] interpreter, the UN came and he
[1:49:33] vindicated that's exactly what he said.
[1:49:35] Denny Henry didn't know a word of
[1:49:37] French.
[1:49:38] And he says, "Because you have chosen
[1:49:39] the hard way, the narrow way by your
[1:49:41] choosing,
[1:49:42] a great portion of heaven awaits you.
[1:49:44] This is a great victory in the love
[1:49:46] divine."
[1:49:47] And that portion of heaven was the word.
[1:49:49] A great portion of the word awaits you.
[1:49:51] Amen.
[1:49:51] Amen. And then he comes now.
[1:49:53] And then now the seals are open.
[1:49:55] So part of Christ that was veiled,
[1:49:58] sealed away.
[1:49:59] Amen.
[1:49:59] Amen. beautiful
[1:50:01] is now made known.
[1:50:03] Amen.
[1:50:04] And all remember in the days of the
[1:50:06] voice of the seventh angel, all the
[1:50:08] mysteries of God should be finished.
[1:50:10] That's not just, as I said, it's not
[1:50:12] just doctrine.
[1:50:13] It's not, oh, I know the Bible, how it
[1:50:16] fits together. It goes beyond that. It's
[1:50:17] now I'm going to fully reveal myself to
[1:50:20] you.
[1:50:21] Amen.
[1:50:22] Amen.
[1:50:23] So,
[1:50:24] but in order, remember, in order to have
[1:50:26] a revelation, he has to be present.
[1:50:29] Amen.
[1:50:29] Amen.
[1:50:30] And so now here he is. So now all that
[1:50:33] heaven is
[1:50:34] Amen.
[1:50:35] Amen. Because remember I said you go
[1:50:37] read in the breach. He says the seventh
[1:50:39] angel's on the on the earth at the time
[1:50:40] of Revelations 10:1 time of this coming.
[1:50:43] And because it seals the book is open.
[1:50:46] Remember that's a symbolic thing. He's
[1:50:47] saying now
[1:50:49] this was this was sealed.
[1:50:52] Amen. This is the book of redemption and
[1:50:54] your name is in this book.
[1:50:56] Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] Amen. That's why when the book was open
[1:51:00] and now he's going to reveal the
[1:51:01] inheritance. Amen. The reason it's
[1:51:03] become alive to you IS BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:51:05] PART of the inheritance.
[1:51:07] Amen. Because that's the reason it's
[1:51:09] quickened to you is because you're part
[1:51:11] of the book.
[1:51:11] Amen.
[1:51:12] That's right.
[1:51:13] Amen. It's a supernatural thing.
[1:51:15] You got to Oh, you so blessed.
[1:51:17] We just recognize what God has done for
[1:51:19] us. Done for you personally.
[1:51:20] Amen. It's not just I'm a Christian.
[1:51:22] That's no God has redeemed you
[1:51:25] and now he's reading the contents of the
[1:51:26] book to you and he and because he's
[1:51:29] present he quickens it to you.
[1:51:31] Hallelujah. SO ALL THAT GOD IS NOW I say
[1:51:34] all that heaven is emptied itself
[1:51:36] and is down upon the earth
[1:51:38] because there's no record of that angel
[1:51:40] ever going away.
[1:51:42] Amen. And that's just Christ leading us
[1:51:44] into the rapture.
[1:51:46] Hallelujah.
[1:51:47] Hallelujah.
[1:51:48] Hallelujah. And the reason I say that
[1:51:50] now,
[1:51:52] the reason I say that is because many
[1:51:54] times we just made you on Revelations
[1:51:55] 10:1-7,
[1:51:57] but 8 to 11 is the bride's ministry.
[1:52:00] Remember, because John,
[1:52:02] it says, remember, he took the book.
[1:52:04] He took the inheritance.
[1:52:06] Amen.
[1:52:06] Amen. It's like a lawyer. You're sitting
[1:52:08] in a lawyer's office. This goes to you.
[1:52:10] This goes to you. This goes to you.
[1:52:11] Writes it down. Signs it. He gives you
[1:52:13] the bit of paperwork.
[1:52:14] And then you go take it. Then you go
[1:52:16] possess whatever's been given to you.
[1:52:17] Right.
[1:52:18] Amen. So now God is God has taken the
[1:52:20] seals off the inheritance.
[1:52:22] He gives it to the seventh angel. He
[1:52:24] preaches it. It calls you out.
[1:52:26] And then what happens is you become one
[1:52:28] with that inheritance.
[1:52:30] Hallelujah. Because it says John was
[1:52:32] told, "Take the book and eat the book."
[1:52:34] I mean, so take the inheritance and
[1:52:36] become one with it.
[1:52:37] And it's sweet in your mouth because
[1:52:39] it's glorious, but it's bitter in the
[1:52:40] belly because there's so many things
[1:52:42] that got to go.
[1:52:44] Hallelujah. Everything's got to go.
[1:52:46] That's not a Don't hold on to anything
[1:52:48] that you once believed.
[1:52:50] I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, but just
[1:52:52] throw it out.
[1:52:53] Lord, if it's contrary to what is the
[1:52:55] truth, help me get rid of it.
[1:52:58] Amen. Because you have to have the
[1:53:00] confidence when the spirit of truth has
[1:53:02] come
[1:53:02] to you personally. He will lead you and
[1:53:05] guide you into all truth.
[1:53:07] Amen.
[1:53:07] And that is the spirit of Christ.
[1:53:10] So you have to have that confidence.
[1:53:12] Amen. So don't be, oh, I don't want to
[1:53:14] be deceived. No. When the spirit of
[1:53:17] truth has come,
[1:53:19] he said, "I'll lead you and guide you
[1:53:20] into all truth."
[1:53:22] He said, "Remember, it'll be so close
[1:53:23] that it will deceive the very elect if
[1:53:25] it was possible."
[1:53:26] That means it is not possible for the
[1:53:28] elect to be deceived.
[1:53:30] Amen.
[1:53:31] Who's elect?
[1:53:33] Amen. You just got to have that
[1:53:34] confidence.
[1:53:35] Don't be scared about it.
[1:53:37] You'll have something in you
[1:53:39] and you will know. And there's a
[1:53:42] difference between your flesh fighting
[1:53:43] it and God saying, "Hey, that's not me."
[1:53:46] And my sheep hear my voice.
[1:53:48] They know my voice. So you'll know if
[1:53:50] it's actually your flesh or it's
[1:53:51] actually
[1:53:53] false that God's warning you.
[1:53:56] And so now
[1:53:58] John, because remember John, it say he
[1:54:00] says after he he he eats the book says
[1:54:03] you must prophesy before many nations.
[1:54:06] Wait, let's just go to that Revelations
[1:54:08] chapter 10 very quickly.
[1:54:13] Last verse. And now I must prophesy
[1:54:15] again before many peoples and nations
[1:54:17] and and tongues peoples, nations,
[1:54:20] tongues and kings. Last verse. John, you
[1:54:23] go look at his life.
[1:54:25] He was on the aisle of Patmos for he had
[1:54:27] this received this book of Revelation
[1:54:29] over two years and then you think he
[1:54:31] goes to Ephesus and he passes the church
[1:54:33] and he dies of old age.
[1:54:36] There's nothing in history where he goes
[1:54:38] and fulfills this
[1:54:40] because it wasn't speaking to him
[1:54:42] personally.
[1:54:43] Speaking of an end time people
[1:54:45] when the word is open.
[1:54:48] Amen.
[1:54:48] Saying that you must because Jonah said
[1:54:51] one man in a vision represents a whole
[1:54:53] group.
[1:54:54] Saying saying now you must become one
[1:54:57] with the with the inheritance
[1:55:00] and you must prophesy again. You must
[1:55:03] speak it again.
[1:55:04] Yeah. That's right.
[1:55:05] Amen. because it's already been spoken.
[1:55:06] Amen.
[1:55:07] But now you must speak it.
[1:55:10] Amen. That's why it's so important. Just
[1:55:13] like in, you know, Revelations 19, when
[1:55:15] the Lord comes on the white horse,
[1:55:18] the word, the two-edged sword is out of
[1:55:20] his mouth,
[1:55:21] you got to fight like your God fights.
[1:55:23] Amen.
[1:55:24] Amen. That's why you got to put the word
[1:55:25] in your mouth.
[1:55:26] Amen.
[1:55:27] Amen. That's why you've got to you've
[1:55:28] got to speak to your mountain.
[1:55:30] Amen.
[1:55:31] Amen. That's why brother Bam had the
[1:55:32] vision. or I think it was a no no I
[1:55:35] think it was a vision or a dream and he
[1:55:36] said there were all this like a like a
[1:55:38] dungeon jail place and there's people
[1:55:42] behind the bars saying deliver us
[1:55:44] brother Bam help us you know and then
[1:55:47] and then that person even said it'll
[1:55:49] take more than this to set us free
[1:55:51] and then so now but then but then God
[1:55:54] said to brother Baron just speak
[1:55:57] and then he begin to speak house of hell
[1:55:59] give way in the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:56:01] says all the all the bars begin to break
[1:56:03] and All the prison doors fell down,
[1:56:06] everything and the people walked free.
[1:56:08] Amen.
[1:56:08] Amen.
[1:56:09] That's why you got to speak the word.
[1:56:12] Amen.
[1:56:12] Amen. Don't be afraid to take God at his
[1:56:14] word. You speak the word.
[1:56:15] Hallelujah.
[1:56:16] Amen. Whatsoever things you believe.
[1:56:19] Amen. Ask and it shall be.
[1:56:22] Amen. If you ask anything in my name,
[1:56:24] then I'll do it.
[1:56:26] Amen.
[1:56:27] Amen.
[1:56:28] Hallelujah. You just got to be yielded
[1:56:30] to have a God answers that. But don't be
[1:56:33] afraid. You got to fight like God
[1:56:34] fights.
[1:56:36] Amen.
[1:56:38] But now I wanted to say all that because
[1:56:42] the reason remember I remember the
[1:56:44] subject is all that God is is here.
[1:56:48] Amen.
[1:56:49] Everything God is is present here.
[1:56:52] Amen.
[1:56:52] Amen.
[1:56:53] Amen.
[1:56:54] And it's not just here on a Sunday
[1:56:56] morning.
[1:56:57] Amen.
[1:56:58] every day,
[1:56:59] every moment of every day, you've got to
[1:57:02] just recognize he's with me.
[1:57:05] Amen.
[1:57:05] Everything he is is with me.
[1:57:08] Amen. Not just a part of himself, a part
[1:57:10] of the word, but now everything he is.
[1:57:14] He's present.
[1:57:16] Amen.
[1:57:16] Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] Amen. Can we have some musicians to
[1:57:19] come?
[1:57:21] You got to recognize all heaven, all
[1:57:23] that heaven is, all healing,
[1:57:26] all redemption, all salvation.
[1:57:29] Amen. Everything you have need of, the
[1:57:32] word is neither even in thy mouth.
[1:57:37] Amen.
[1:57:42] So whatever you have need of today,
[1:57:46] he's here.
[1:57:49] Amen. Remember
[1:57:51] the pillar of fire did not leave when
[1:57:53] brother Brown was taken off the scene.
[1:57:56] Yeah.
[1:57:57] That same I'm fully persuaded the same
[1:58:00] God that was back there is with us.
[1:58:03] I'm fully persuaded.
[1:58:05] Amen. Because he does the same things.
[1:58:07] He produces the same kind of life.
[1:58:10] Amen. He's vindicated his word to us. I
[1:58:13] just thinking, yo, you just think
[1:58:15] whenever you get down to a bad patch,
[1:58:18] just go back over your testimony.
[1:58:20] Amen.
[1:58:21] Amen. And just think of all the amazing
[1:58:23] things he has done.
[1:58:25] Amen. And against the odds,
[1:58:28] we're still walking.
[1:58:30] Because this whole world is stacked
[1:58:32] against you. But you've got to recognize
[1:58:34] if God be for me,
[1:58:36] who can be against me?
[1:58:38] Hallelujah. And God is for us. Amen.
[1:58:42] Otherwise, he would never have. Why
[1:58:43] would he reveal himself? Why did he
[1:58:45] reveal himself to Abraham?
[1:58:47] Because he wanted because Abraham was
[1:58:50] part of him.
[1:58:52] Yeah.
[1:58:52] Why was he Jehovah Sheama to to Abraham?
[1:58:55] It wasn't just, oh, I'm going to make
[1:58:57] him a religious kind of guy.
[1:58:58] No, he had a certain promise that he was
[1:59:01] going to fulfill through his life.
[1:59:03] And why does he reveal himself to you?
[1:59:06] Because he has certain promise. They
[1:59:08] which are alive and remain shall not
[1:59:10] hinder them which are asleep. For the
[1:59:11] dead in Christ arise first, and we which
[1:59:13] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:59:15] to with them to meet the Lord in the
[1:59:17] air.
[1:59:17] Amen.
[1:59:18] Amen.
[1:59:20] That is our promise, friends.
[1:59:22] Amen.
[1:59:25] I could go on, but you got to
[1:59:26] understand, you got to just hold it in
[1:59:28] front of you.
[1:59:29] Amen.
[1:59:30] Amen. We have our ups and downs. We have
[1:59:33] whatever more, but God is with us.
[1:59:36] God is with you.
[1:59:37] All that heaven is is is invested in
[1:59:41] you.
[1:59:42] Yeah.
[1:59:43] Amen.
[1:59:44] Malachi 4, behold, I send you Elijah the
[1:59:46] prophet before the great and dreadful
[1:59:47] day of the Lord.
[1:59:48] Amen.
[1:59:49] You say, "Well, I'm not in the
[1:59:50] scripture." Yeah, you are. It says you.
[1:59:52] It says me.
[1:59:54] Amen.
[1:59:54] Amen. And if he and if he if if there's
[1:59:56] only one going in the rapture, he'd do
[1:59:58] it all for one.
[2:00:00] Amen.
[2:00:00] Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:01] If Jesus was dying just for me, he would
[2:00:03] have done it all.
[2:00:05] Amen. The whole Bible, all the prophecy,
[2:00:07] whatever, all the shadows, whatever
[2:00:08] more, all would have been done just for
[2:00:10] one.
[2:00:11] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet,
[2:00:14] and the God of Elijah is with us.
[2:00:17] Amen.
[2:00:19] Hallelujah. Let's stand, shall we? I
[2:00:23] just trust it sinks in today.
[2:00:25] Amen.
[2:00:25] Hallelujah. God's with me.
[2:00:27] Amen.
[2:00:27] God is my strength. He He's the strength
[2:00:29] of my life.

[2:00:31] Hallelujah.
[2:00:34] Amen. And let's just Can we just sing He
[2:00:35] is here again. Hallelujah. God's here.

[2:00:42] bunch of excitement, people crying and
[2:00:43] shouting." Just open your heart. Give
[2:00:46] him one second.

[2:01:41] He is [music and singing] here.
[2:01:45] You
[2:01:46] can touch him. [singing]
[2:01:50] You [music] will never
[2:01:53] [singing] be
[2:01:55] the same.
[2:01:58] [music]
[2:01:58] He is here.
[2:02:02] Hallelujah.
[2:02:07] He [music and singing] is here.
[2:02:10] Amen.
[2:02:13] [music and singing]
[2:02:16] He is here.
[2:02:19] Holy, [singing and music]
[2:02:21] holy.
[2:02:24] I will [music and singing] bless
[2:02:27] his holy
[2:02:29] name.
[2:02:31] [music]
[2:02:33] He is here. [singing]
[2:02:36] Listen
[2:02:38] closely. [music]
[2:02:42] Hear him [singing] calling
[2:02:44] [music] out
[2:02:46] your name.
[2:02:50] He is here. [music]
[2:02:54] You
[2:02:55] can [singing] touch him.
[2:02:59] You will [music] never
[2:03:02] [singing] be
[2:03:04] the same.
[2:03:07] So I just want to read one more. [music]
[2:03:10] You say now listen to this.
[2:03:13] Doesn't Christ the mystery of God again?
[2:03:20] He says [music]
[2:03:20] now the same God, the same pillar of
[2:03:24] fire, the same way. Speaking of now,
[2:03:26] [music]
[2:03:27] uh, and back in Israel, he cannot change
[2:03:29] his way. Is that just perfect? How many
[2:03:32] gods did Israel have? One. How many
[2:03:34] [music] has the bride got? One. How many
[2:03:37] will there ever be? One. Sure. Sure.
[2:03:40] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:42] which was the pillar of fire in the days
[2:03:44] of Moses the great prophet. He is
[2:03:45] directed by a pillar of fire. Is that
[2:03:47] right? Going [music] to a promised land.
[2:03:50] And in the Christian age there was one
[2:03:52] God which appeared in the form of a
[2:03:53] pillar of fire to a prophet called Paul
[2:03:56] who was sent to the Gentiles to take a
[2:03:58] people out for his name's sake. Is
[2:04:00] [music] that right? and in the last days
[2:04:02] has come down in like manner vindicating
[2:04:05] himself in the same signs, [music] same
[2:04:08] wonder, same pillar of fire, same
[2:04:10] gospel, same word, same manifestation.
[2:04:12] His body will do the works that he
[2:04:15] promised like in Mark 16 [music] and so
[2:04:17] forth. His body was not held in the
[2:04:19] grave but was recognized with him in the
[2:04:22] resurrection. Do you get it? then in the
[2:04:24] body of his believing children will not
[2:04:26] be held in the grave when he comes but
[2:04:29] will be recognized with him because he
[2:04:31] died for a purpose to resurrect his
[2:04:33] bride the [music] body recognized
[2:04:36] because it's his body because it's the
[2:04:37] word it's so completely yielded from
[2:04:41] denominations and things to him and he
[2:04:44] is the word seed and it's recognized
[2:04:47] with him because now we have the first
[2:04:50] fruit of first fruit of our resurrection
[2:04:53] by knowing that we've passed from death
[2:04:56] under life become prisoners of his and
[2:04:59] God proving to us by his personal
[2:05:02] headship that he is the same yesterday
[2:05:04] today and forever by doing the same
[2:05:06] things through the church that he did
[2:05:08] then he in me and I in him and you
[2:05:12] [music] and him and so forth. That's
[2:05:15] right. His body was not held in the
[2:05:17] grave recognized with him in the
[2:05:19] resurrection.
[2:05:20] Amen.
[2:05:20] Same as he is now. Now listen, which
[2:05:22] means this his word which he is has has
[2:05:26] beun to be risen. The word that down
[2:05:29] through the age of Luther Wesley see has
[2:05:31] beun to rise up to its power. There it
[2:05:34] be to move. Then it moved a little more.
[2:05:36] Now it's coming up to identification.
[2:05:39] See watch now to the bo to the life in
[2:05:44] the body is a vindication of the rapture
[2:05:47] is at [music] hand. Amen.
[2:05:49] You understand the proof that the
[2:05:51] rapture is at hand is because his life
[2:05:53] is in you.
[2:05:54] Amen.
[2:05:55] Amen. You [music] see the headship and
[2:05:58] the body become one and the fullness of
[2:06:01] the measure of his manifestation shows
[2:06:04] that the body is ready to be received to
[2:06:07] the headship. He says nations are
[2:06:09] breaking Israel awakening. See what I
[2:06:10] mean? He has begun to give life into his
[2:06:13] body.
[2:06:14] Why? The one that he has redeemed, the
[2:06:18] mediatorial work is done. He's bringing
[2:06:21] his life to the body in the vindication
[2:06:24] for [music] the rapture.
[2:06:26] Amen.
[2:06:27] Amen. How do you know you're going?
[2:06:29] Because his life is in you.
[2:06:31] Amen.
[2:06:32] And that is the proof or the vindication
[2:06:34] that the rapture [music] is at hand.
[2:06:36] Amen.
[2:06:37] Hallelujah.
[2:06:39] Amen. [music] Hallelujah. I'm so glad to
[2:06:41] be a believer.
[2:06:42] Amen.
[2:06:43] Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] Amen. Let's just let's just sing. You
[2:06:46] chose me. [music] And if anyone has
[2:06:48] prayer or maybe someone who hasn't given
[2:06:50] their life to Christ and wants to,
[2:06:52] you're more than welcome to come.
[2:06:55] He is here. Hallelujah.
[2:06:58] Amen.

[2:23:01] all that you are is upon the earth.
[2:23:03] Lord, all that you are is in us, Lord
[2:23:05] Jesus. Father, you said you'd be with
[2:23:08] us, even in us to the end of the world.
[2:23:10] Lord, we want to thank you, Lord, that
[2:23:12] you are Jehovah Shama. You're the God
[2:23:13] that's present. Lord Jesus, you said

[2:23:18] Father, we want to praise your mighty

[2:23:41] We're so [music] glad we can say, "Thou

[2:23:48] are, Lord. Father, we sometimes we get
[2:23:51] so down and Lord, we get discouraged. We
[2:23:53] want to just give up and watch the world
[2:23:55] go by. But Lord, you don't leave us in
[2:23:57] that state, Lord. You lift us up. You
[2:24:00] strengthen us, Lord Jesus. [music] Want
[2:24:02] to praise your mighty name, oh God.
[2:24:04] Father, may we not listen to the enemy's

[2:24:08] how great you are and what you've done
[2:24:09] for us, Lord. We thank you, Lord. You're

[2:24:20] praise your mighty name for that, oh
[2:24:22] God. Father, go out those who are

[2:24:25] just now as well. Father, touch the
[2:24:28] sick, Lord. Raise up the sick, oh God,
[2:24:31] there. Father, we want pray, Lord, you
[2:24:34] go touch them, Lord Jesus. We thank you
[2:24:36] that you are their God as well, Lord
[2:24:38] Jesus. We praise your mighty name. I
[2:24:42] pray, oh God, that these five senses,
[2:24:44] Father, may we not lean upon what we
[2:24:46] see, what we feel, what we hear, what we
[2:24:48] remember, Lord, what we imagine, but may
[2:24:50] we just our may our eyes of faith, Lord.
[2:24:54] Father, may our eyes of faith be so
[2:24:56] strong, so zeroed in upon you, Lord.
[2:24:59] Father, may you grant it for your glory.
[2:25:02] Oh Lord, you're closer than our next
[2:25:03] breath. Hallelujah.
[2:25:05] Father, may we just recognize that and
[2:25:07] know that's true, Lord Jesus, in a
[2:25:09] greater way.
[2:25:10] Grant it, Lord, I pray. Father.
[2:25:13] Oh Lord, may we Lord, sometimes we're
[2:25:15] like Gahazi, their Lord, and Elisha, and
[2:25:17] they're all and he's all worried about
[2:25:19] the Assyrians coming to get him. But the
[2:25:21] prophet said, "There's more for us than
[2:25:23] against us." And the prophet prayed,
[2:25:25] "Open his eyes, Lord." And the chariots
[2:25:28] of fire were covered every hill. The
[2:25:30] mighty army of yours was there.
[2:25:33] Lord Jesus, that prayer didn't make them
[2:25:35] appear or or or come upon the hills, but
[2:25:39] they were already there. It's only his
[2:25:41] eyes that needed to come open to
[2:25:43] recognize it, Lord.
[2:25:45] Father, may our eyes of faith come open
[2:25:47] in a greater way that we would recognize
[2:25:49] all that you are is around us, Lord, and
[2:25:52] not around us, but in us, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:55] May you grant that, I pray, [music]
[2:25:56] Father.
[2:25:57] Oh, Lord, renew our vision, Lord, that
[2:25:59] we'd see your present among us, Lord.
[2:26:02] Not just here in the morning, but every
[2:26:04] day, wherever we go. [music] We can be
[2:26:06] by ourselves, but you're with us, Lord.
[2:26:08] We're never alone because you're with
[2:26:10] us, Lord.
[2:26:11] Father, may we recognize that for your
[2:26:13] glory, [music] Lord.
[2:26:14] Father, I want to commit each one here.
[2:26:16] Father, let us
[2:26:18] Father, you see every battle [music] we
[2:26:19] face,
[2:26:20] Lord. Our [singing] burdens we carry,
[2:26:23] Lord. We thank you. We can just deny
[2:26:24] Satan. And that he's a defeated being.
[2:26:27] We can just deny him and walk on. We
[2:26:30] thank you, Lord. Even if he comes to try
[2:26:32] and afflict us again, we can just deny
[2:26:33] him again and he must flee. We can
[2:26:36] actively resist the devil and he will
[2:26:37] flee. The scripture tells us,
[2:26:40] "Father, I pray you give us strength,
[2:26:41] Lord. May we continue to overcome all
[2:26:43] things.
[2:26:45] Father, grant it for your great glory,
[2:26:47] Lord Jesus.
[2:26:48] Oh, Lord. We thank you. You're among us,
[2:26:50] Lord. We thank you. You're with us, Lord
[2:26:53] Jesus. We praise your mighty name, Lord.
[2:26:55] [music]
[2:26:55] In Jesus Christ's name, we thank you,
[2:26:57] Father, for these things in Jesus
[2:27:00] Christ's name." Amen.

[2:40:07] God saying, "I'm going to meet you in
[2:40:08] there."
[2:40:09] Hallelujah.
